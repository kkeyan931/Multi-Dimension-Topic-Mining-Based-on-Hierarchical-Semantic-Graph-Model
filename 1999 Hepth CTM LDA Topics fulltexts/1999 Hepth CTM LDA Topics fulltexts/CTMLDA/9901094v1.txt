abstract. we develop classical globally supersymmetric theories. as much as pos-
sible, we treat various dimensions and various amounts of supersymmetry in a uni-
form manner. we discuss theories both in components and in superspace. through-
out we emphasize geometric aspects. the beginning chapters give a general discus-
sion about supersymmetric eld theories; then we move on to detailed computations
of lagrangians, etc. in specic theories. an appendix details our sign conventions.
this text will appear in a two-volume work quantum fields and strings: a course
for mathematicians to be published soon by the american mathematical society.

introduction

this text develops the basic classical supersymmetric eld theories in all dimen-
sions, but without supergravity. we emphasize at the start that although we hope
to provide a bit of a fresh viewpoint in some places, this is standard material for the
working quantum eld theorist (string theorist, m -theorist, . . . )it was largely de-
veloped in the physics literature of the 1970s and 1980s. this account began as the
solutions to the superhomework problems in [i-homework], but then developed
into a larger project. unfortunately, we often sink into an unpalatable morass of in-
dices which may obscure the underlying geometry.3 so we hope in this introduction
to at least provide a roadmap to the more conceptual parts of the text. certainly
some readers may nd the plethora of formulas useful. indeed, we have gone to
great lengths4 to ensure their accuracy, though undoubtedly errors have crept in.
since there are so many formulas, we have boxed the ones we thought most crucial
or most likely to be referenced. one contribution here is a consistent choice of con-
ventions in all dimensions and with varying amounts of supersymmetry. our sign
conventions are summarized in the appendix. throughout we freely use notions of
supergeometry as developed in [i-supersymmetry] and notions of classical eld
theory as developed in [i-classical fields]. knowledge of spinors [i-spinors] is
also indispensable.

the basic poincare-invariant classical eld theories of a scalar eld (spin 0),
spinor eld (spin 1/2), and gauge eld (spin 1) exist in any dimension n. here
we are interested in eld theories which are invariant under a supergroup which
extends the poincare group. such a super poincare group is determined by a real
spin representation s of the lorentzian spin group spin(1, n  1) together with a
symmetric pairing s  s  v into the vectors, as we explain in 1.1. a theory
has minimal supersymmetry if s is a minimal (that is, irreducible) spin represen-
tation; otherwise, it is said to have extended supersymmetry. we construct theories
on minkowski space which obey the spin-statistics connection, so that odd sym-
metries map elds of integral spin to elds of half-integral spin. it is convenient
to measure the amount of supersymmetry in terms of s = dim s. the larger s
is, the greater the mixing of elds of dierent spin. as we consider theories only5
with elds of spins at most one, we are restricted to small values of s. specically,
supersymmetric -modelswhich only have elds of spins at most one-halfmust
have s  8 and supersymmetric gauge theories must have s  16. because of this
restriction the theory has a small set of general examples and the study of the theory
is centered on the examples. we mostly consider theories with s = 2, 4, 8, 16 super-
symmetries and these occur in the maximal dimensions n = 3, 4, 6, 10. maximal
means, for example, that only in dimensions  6 are there real spin representations
of dimension 8. (we also say a bit in 1.3 about theories with a single supersym-
metry and there is more in problem fp2 of [i-homework], which we recommend
as a starting point before tackling the more complicated theories with more super-
symmetry. other problems in [i-homework] also deal with formal properties of
supersymmetric eld theories.) by the exceptional isomorphisms among low dimen-
sional lie groups, the lorentzian spin group in dimensions n = 3, 4, 6 is sl(2, f)
for f = r, c, h. (there is also a sense in which the spin group in 10 dimensions
is sl(2, o) for the octonions o : see [i-spinors, 6.56.7].) our treatment em-
phasizes this exceptional isomorphism, both in its theoretical and computational
aspects. throughout we focus on theories in the maximal dimension, though in
some cases (see chapter 9, for example) we work out some lower dimensional theo-
ries obtained by dimensional reduction. (not everything in lower dimensions comes
by dimensional reduction from the maximal dimension, but we barely mention the
exceptions.)

a supersymmetric eld theory is rst of all an ordinary (lagrangian) eld the-
ory on minkowski space, described by a set of elds and a lagrangian. as usual
the poincare symmetry is manifest.
in addition, there are nonmanifest odd in-
nitesimal symmetries corresponding to the odd generators of the super poincare
algebra.
in this approach one checks by direct computation that the theory is
supersymmetric, i.e., that the odd transformation of the elds is a symmetry of
the lagrangian. this is the approach we follow in chapter 3 for -models and in
chapter 6 for pure yang-mills theories. although there are heuristic arguments
to motivate the form of the odd symmetries, they are not geometric. moreover,
in many examples the bracketing relations of the super poincare algebra are only
obeyed on-shell. it is more satisfying to use a superspace formulation in which the
entire super poincare symmetry is manifest. in this approach the spacetime m of
the classical eld theory is super minkowski space, a supermanifold whose underly-
ing ordinary manifold is ordinary minkowski space. the super poincare group acts

as symmetry transformations of super minkowski space. the elds in the theory,
usually called superelds, are functions on super minkowski space. then super
poincare acts on superelds by pullback, and we can write manifestly supersymmet-
ric lagrangians. by restricting superelds and their derivatives to the underlying
ordinary minkowski space, we recover the component elds of the ordinary eld
theory on minkowski space, and by partial integration we recover the component
lagrangian. these general ideas are explained in chapter 1.

although superspace formulations have the overriding virtue of exhibiting the
supersymmetry in a manifest way, there are several drawbacks. first and foremost,
there is not always a superspace formulation! unfortunately, that is the case for
theories with the maximal allowed supersymmetry: -models with 8 supersymme-
tries and yang-mills theories with 16 supersymmetries. there are good superspace
formulations for all theories with at most 4 supersymmetries and also for pure gauge
theories with at most 8 supersymmetries. of course, one can use the superspace
formulation with 4 supersymmetries even for theories with more supersymmetry;
then some of the supersymmetry is manifest and some is nonmanifest. another
disadvantage of superspace formulations is that in many cases the superelds are
constrained. this complicates the classical eld theory computations. also, the
constraints vary from case to case and add further to the specicity of the subject.
to a physicist the most damning criticism of the superspace formulation is that it
obscures the physical intuition, which is based on experience with ordinary elds
on minkowski space. these drawbacks are balanced by the manifest geometric real-
ization of odd symmetries, particularly when applied to the quantum theory. (for
example, the possible form of quantum corrections to the classical action is clearer
in the superspace formulation.) so we persist in presenting the superspace point of
view alongside the component approach.

chapters 1 and 2 are preliminary. chapter 1 describes features of classical
supersymmetric eld theories which go beyond the general ideas of classical eld
theory. in chapter 2 we describe the coordinates and bases we use to compute in 3,
4, and 6 dimensions. as mentioned before, they are based on the special form of
the spin group in those cases. we list many formulas for easy future reference.

our real work begins in chapter 3, where we study supersymmetric -models
in components. the quantum theories are often discussed in 2 dimensions, but we
treat the classical theories in the maximal dimensions n = 3, 4, 6 (where they have
minimal supersymmetry). in the linear case we give a uniform description of the
theory and a uniform proof of supersymmetry.
in the nonlinear case the scalar
eld is a map from ordinary minkowski space to a curved riemannian manifold x.
supersymmetry constrains x: in the n = 4 theory x must be kahler and in the
n = 6 theory x must by hyperkahler. in 3.3 we give a uniform motivation for
these constraints. in the nonlinear case there are curvature terms in the lagrangian,
and as they vary in the three cases we check supersymmetry on a case-by-case basis.
in addition to the kinetic terms, there are supersymmetric potential terms one can
add in the n = 3, 4 theories; they are summarized in 3.4.
chapters 4 and 5 present the superspace formulation of supersymmetric -
models in n = 3, 4 dimensions, including potential terms.
in chapter 4 we not
only derive the component lagrangian and supersymmetry transformations, but we
also discuss the classical eld theory computations directly in superspace, including
the computation of the noether current for the supersymmetries. this is the only
example we work out in such detail in superspace. the superspace lagrangian of

4

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

the n = 4 theory is usually given in terms of a local kahler potential on the target
manifold x, and so does not make sense globally. in 5.2 we point out a global
lagrangian in case the target manifold is hodge.
in chapter 6 we add gauge elds to the mix. we begin in 6.1 with pure
supersymmetric yang-mills theories in components. the usual argument which
veries supersymmetry relies on a fierz identity, something we do not encounter
in our treatment. instead we rely on a geometric property of spinors which only
holds in dimensions n = 3, 4, 6, 10 with the minimal real spinor representation: the
quadratic pairing on spinors takes values on the light cone. (in other cases the
values are positive timelike or lightlike, not just lightlike.) that same property
enters again in 6.3, where we describe some common features of the superspace
formulation of the theory in n = 3, 4, 6 dimensions. in each case the basic supereld
is a connection on super minkowski space constrained to have vanishing curvature
along a canonical odd distribution. the aforementioned special property of spinors
is used to see that this constraint leads to the correct physical component elds.
on the other hand, the auxiliary elds6 dier in each case; they are treated in later
chapters.

the most general theory without gravity is a gauge theory with mattera cou-
pled system consisting of scalar elds, spinor elds, and gauge elds. the general
supersymmetric theories are summarized in theorem 6.33. of interest in appli-
cations are the nontrivial potential energy functions which appear; they lead to
nontrivial classical moduli spaces. we describe the coupled systems in dimen-
sions n = 3, 4, 6 with minimal supersymmetry. (recall that there is no possible
-model with s = 16 supersymmetries, only the pure yang-mills theory described
previously.) systems with s = 2, 4, 8 supersymmetries in lower dimensions are of-
ten, but not always, obtained by dimensional reduction from the theories described
here. for n = 3, 4 there is a good superspace description from which the compo-
nent description may be derived. this is the subject of chapters 7 and 8. in the
n = 4 case the appearance of the moment map in the component lagrangian has a
geometric explanation, at least if the target kahler manifold is hodge (see 8.3).
in chapters 7 through 11 we only describe the yang-mills terms in the lagrangian,
having treated the -model terms in chapters 4 and 5. chapter 10 gives the su-
perspace description of super yang-mills theory in n = 6 dimensions. (recall here
that there is no superspace description of the -model, hence none of the coupled
system.) for each of the cases n = 3, 4, 6 we prove that the category7 of constrained
connections is equivalent to the category of component elds. for the n = 6 case
the proof is presented in chapter 11.

a connection is locally specied by n lie algebra-valued functions in n dimen-
sions, and the dimensional reduction to n  k dimensions still has n functions:
n  k of them transform as a connection and k of them as scalar elds (see 9.1).
there are two cases of dimensionally reduced super yang-mills theory which are of
particular interestthe reduction of the n = 4 theory to 2 dimensions and the re-
duction of the n = 6 theory to 4 dimensions. the former is the subject of chapter 9
and the latter the subject of 10.2.

6an auxiliary eld has an algebraic equation of motion and does not correspond to a physical
degree of freedom.
7because of the local gauge transformations, the collection of connections (gauge elds) forms a
category, not a set.

introduction

finally, in 5.5 and 10.3 we describe theories in n = 4 dimensions with ex-
tended supersymmetry on the minimal super minkowski space. then four of the
supersymmetries are manifest and the extended supersymmetry is nonmanifest.

in several places we refer to the n = 3, 4, 6 cases with minimal supersymmetry

as the f = r, c, h cases.

writing this has been an absolute cauchemar de signes! standard dierential
geometry has some bad signs, classical eld theory has tricky sign conventions, and
odd variables add a whole new level of complication. our sign conventions are
explained in the previous texts in part 1 and are summarized in [i-signs].

during the preparation of this manuscript we received advice and help from
many people. certainly edward wittens superhomework [i-homework] was our
starting point for organizing the material, and ed was invaluable at many other
times. input from our classmates, notably david kazhdan and john morgan, is
also reected here, as is the advice of joseph bernstein, nati seiberg, and many
others. however, they should not be held accountable for any errors.

a supersymmetric eld theory has as symmetry group a super poincare group.
in 1.1 we dene these supergroups as symmetry groups of super minkowski space.
in many cases supersymmetric theories have a superspace formulation in terms of
elds dened on super minkowski space. passage from the superspace formulation
to the formulation in components on ordinary minkowski space is the subject
of 1.2. the simplest example is in one dimension (time) with one odd variable;
this is described in 1.3.
1.1. super minkowski spaces and super poincare groups
a super minkowski space m is constructed as follows. the starting data are a
minkowski space m with vector space of translations v , a positive cone c of time-
like vectors in v , a real spinorial representation s of spin(v ), and a symmetric
morphism  of representations of spin(v ):

 : s  s  v.

minkowski space is an ane space:

(1.1)
which is positive denite in the sense that (s, s)  c for s  s, with
(s, s) = 0 only for s = 0.
it has no origin. by the classication
in [i-spinors, 6.3(i)], once the representation s is given, positive denite  as
in (1.1) exist and are unique up to automorphisms of the representation s.
if
s is an irreducible real spinorial representation, nonzero symmetric morphisms
s  s  v are unique up to a factor, are positive or negative denite, and are
respected by elements of norm 1 in the eld of endomorphisms of s (isomorphic to
r, c or h) [i-spinors, 6.1].
and the choice of a positive cone.

note that so far we have not used the metric on v , only its conformal structure

by [i-spinors, 6.2] there is a unique symmetric morphism

(1.2)
related to  by the following formula. with respect to a basis {e} of v and {f a}
of s, write8 (fa, fb) =

into morphisms

: v  hom(s, s)

i.e., if one denes  and  by

t(cid:0)(v)(s)(cid:1) = ((s, t), v)

(v)(s)(t) = ((s, t), v),

and

then (1.3) means that for v in v ,

(v)(v): s  s
(v)(v): s  s

and

are multiplication by (v, v). in other words,  and  turn s s into a module over
the cliord algebra c(v ). by [i-spinors, 4.9.6] the action of spin(v ) on s and
s is induced by this c(v )-module structure. taking the trace in (v)(v) = (v, v),
i.e., contracting the indices a and c in (1.3), one obtains

(1.6)


ab

ab + 
ab

ab = 2 dim(s)g .

the identity (1.3) also means that if (v, v) 6= 0, the inverse of the symmetric
bilinear form ((s, t), v) on s is the bilinear form (v, v)1((s, t), v) on s. for
v in c, the bilinear form ((s, t), v) is hence positive denite, and : s  s  v is
positive denite.
by the unicity of  up to automorphisms of s, it follows that if the repre-
sentation s of spin(v ) is isomorphic to its dual, there exists an isomorphism of
representations : s  s such that
(1.7)

(s, t) = ((s), (t)) .

this isomorphism corresponds to a nondegenerate spin(v )-invariant bilinear form 
on s:

(1.8)

(s, t) = (s)(t) .

the form (t, s) corresponds to the transpose t of . one has also (s, t) =
(t(s), t(t)).
indeed, expressing for (v, v) 6= 0 that the nondegenerate forms
(v, (s, t)) and (v, ((s), (t))) have the same inverse, one nds that (s, t) =
((s), (t)), with  = t1.

in coordinates, (1.7) reads

(1.9)

ab = 

cd acbd .

we now assume that s is irreducible, and is isomorphic to its dual. this
excludes the cases where the dimension n of v is congruent to 2 or 6 modulo 8.
we treat in turn the cases where the eld of endomorphisms z of s is isomorphic
to r (n  1 or 3 mod 8), h (n  5 or 7 mod 8) or c (n  0 or 4 mod 8). note that
(1.7) holds up to a factor for any invariant non-zero bilinear form .

case z = r. up to a factor, s admits a unique invariant bilinear form, symmetric
for n  1(mod8) and alternating for n  3(mod8). the form  for which (1.7)
holds is unique up to sign.

case z = h. up to a factor, s admits a unique invariant bilinear form such that

(1.10)

(sh, t) = (s, th),

h  h,

s, t  s.

(we take s to be a right h-module.) after extension of scalars from r to c,
s becomes s0  w , with s0 irreducible and w of dimension 2, h becomes end(w )
and (1.10) means that  = 0  w , for 0 invariant on s0 and w the alternating
form on w . the form  for which (1.10) holds is symmetric for n  5(mod8) and
alternating for n  7(mod8), as 0 is respectively alternating and symmetric [i-
spinors, 1.5.1]. the form  for which (1.10) and (1.7) holds is unique up to
sign.

case z = c. after extension of scalars to c, s becomes the sum of two irreducible
representations, orthogonal for n  0(mod8) and symplectic for n  4(mod8).
over r, the invariant bilinear form will correspondingly be orthogonal or symplec-
tic, with (zs, t) = (s, zt). the ones for which (1.7) holds form a u1-orbit under
(s, t) 7 (s, ut).

in all cases,  is symmetric or antisymmetric, so that the resulting isomorphism
: s  s is unambiguous, at least up to sign. transporting  by , we obtain the
dual form  on s, which is completely unambiguous. one has9

if the dimension is congruent to 2 or 6 (mod8)i.e., for the range of dimen-
sions of physical interest, in dimensions 2, 6 and 10there are super minkowski
spaces based on unequal number of copies of the half spinor representations s+ and
s. the invariant pairing in those dimensions is between s+ and s, so that 
and  encode information not related by a self-duality pairing.

let l be the following super lie algebra: l0 = v , l1 = s, the subalgebra l0 =
v is central, and the lie bracket on s is 2. the corresponding super lie
group expl is dened to be a simply connected super lie group, given with an

isomorphism of l with its lie algebra of left-invariant vector elds.
constructed as follows. as a space it is

(1.12)

expl = v  s.

in other words, for any supercommutative ring r the set of its r-points is the even
part of lr = l r = rl. the group law is derived from the hausdor formula,
which terminates after the quadratic term since [x, [y, z]] = 0 for all x, y, z  l:

9we do not set a convention for raising and lowering a single index with  in the antisymmetric
case, since, as was just explained, this involves an arbitrary sign choice we prefer not to make.
however, there is no ambiguity in raising and lowering an even number of indices, as for example
in (1.10). thus 12 = ab1a2b = 211221 = 21 = 12. beware: many standard physics texts
use a dierent convention here.

the bases of v , s induce a coordinate system (x, a) on exp(l) = v  s: the

the da, being left-invariant, have the same brackets as the abstract lie algebra l.
(see (1.15).) the vector elds da and qb commute, since right and left translations
commute.

super minkowski space m is the underlying supermanifold of the super lie
group exp(l). we let exp(l) act on the left on m by left translations. corre-
sponding to (1.12) we have a splitting

m = m  s.

it is well-dened since the ambiguity in identifying m with exp(l) is translation
by an element of v , and such translations preserve the splitting (1.12). the super

poincare group is the semi-direct product spin(v )  exp(l). it acts on m , and
the structures we will consider on m are invariant under the super poincare group,
with one notable exceptionthe splitting (1.20). for example, the left translates
of s = l1  l form a left-invariant distribution  on m which is preserved by the
action of the super poincare group.
as we saw, bases {e} of v  and {f a} of s give a coordinate system (x, a)
on m = exp(l). it will often be more convenient to make computations not in
this coordinate system, but rather using the left-invariant moving frame consisting
of the vector elds da,  and/or the dual moving coframe consisting of the 1-

also, we will sometimes use complex bases and so complex vector elds and dier-
ential forms. the complex conjugate of a product is the product of the complex
conjugates in the same order, even for odd elements.10

the innitesimal generators of the action of exp(l) on m are the right-invariant
vector elds. the qa dened above are a basis of the odd right-invariant vector
elds.

a spinor eld  = af a on m is a map  : m  s. the form  then
determines a symmetric (in the super sense) bilinear form on spinor elds, which
we denote with the usual physicists notation:

(1.22)

d/ = (, ) = abab.

we call (1.22) the dirac form. one should understand d/ in this formula as
the name of the bilinear form, which has been inserted between the arguments.
the dirac form is symmetric up to an exact term, so is exactly symmetric when
integrated over m (assuming no contributions at innity). a dual spinor eld
 = afa is a map  : m  s, and we have the (dual) dirac form

(1.23)

d/ = (, ) = 

abab.

if there is a duality pairing (1.8), then we can use it to identify dual spinors with
spinors, in which case (1.23) is identied with (1.22).

we complexify v and s to construct complexied super minkowski space mc.
inside mc we may consider a real ane subspace e of euclidean signature.11 how-
ever, the complex spinors sc generally will not carry a real structure under the
euclidean spin group spin(e), and so the corresponding superspace m  sc is
complex in odd directions. it is a cs supermanifold [i-supersymmetry, 4.8]. the
lagrangians we construct can be rotated to euclidean space.12

10see 5 of [i-signs].
11with our sign conventions the metric will be negative denite; simply change the sign of the
metric to obtain a positive denite metric.

[i-classical fields].

remark 1.24. the super minkowski space is usually called n = k superspace
if s is the sum of k irreducible real representations of spin(v ). however, the usage
uctuates somewhat for n = dim( m ) small. for example, if dim( m ) = 2, then
n = 1 usually means that s is the sum of the two inequivalent real semi-spinorial
representations s+ and s. it is more informative to use the notation m n|s to in-
dicate s supersymmetries in n dimensions, and in dimensions n  2(mod4) to use
a special notation to indicate the precise spinorial representation: m n|(s+,s) de-
notes a super minkowski space of dimension n|s+ + s built from a spinorial rep-
resentation which is a sum of copies of s+, of dimension s+, and a sum of copies
of s, of dimension s.

the connected group of outer automorphisms of the super poincare group which
x the poincare subgroup is called the r-symmetry group. dimensional reduction
leads to an r-symmetry group (double covering rotations in the extra spatial di-
mensions), but it is not the only source of r-symmetries.

1.2. superelds, component elds, and lagrangians13

for many theories we work directly on super minkowski space m .

in such
situations we say the theory has a superspace formulation. fields on m are called
superelds. just as in ordinary nonsupersymmetric eld theory, typical examples
are: (i) maps  : m  x into an ordinary manifold x; and (ii) a connection a on
a principal bundle p  m . very often superelds are constrained. for example,
in the four-dimensional supersymmetric -model we constrain certain derivatives
of  to vanish, and in all super gauge theories we constrain certain components
of the curvature to vanish. the usual elementary facts about functions apply to
superelds. thus elementary operations such as composition, sum, and product
produce new superelds. we can also produce new superelds by dierentiation,
for example by the vector elds da, qa dened in (1.18).

component elds are ordinary (even and odd) elds on minkowski space m .
we view these as maps from m into a supermanifold. given a supereld  we
dene its component elds to be the restriction to m of certain derivatives of .
let

(1.25)

i : m  m

denote the inclusion of minkowski space into super minkowski space. then for a
map  : m  x we typically dene a multiplet of component elds (, , f ) with
formulas like

(1.26)

 = i,
 = id,
f = idd.

for specic instances, see (4.2) or (5.3). the denition of the multiplet is chosen so
that the supermanifold of superelds is isomorphic to the supermanifold of multi-
plets. (in gauge theory this is an equivalence of categories rather than a bijection.)

13our formulas in this subsection are meant to be suggestive only. precise versions depend on
the particular theory; they appear in subsequent sections. for example, versions of (1.26) for
the supersymmetric -model appear in (4.7) and (5.7). also, versions of (1.29) are used in the
supersymmetric -model to compute (4.14) and (5.10).

in (1.26)  is a map  : m  x and  is a spinor eld on m with values in t x.
note that , f are even, whereas  is odd. the eld f is auxiliary in the sense
that for fundamental lagrangians no derivatives of f occur in the lagrangian. the
classical eld equation for f (keeping the other elds xed) expresses f in terms of
the other elds. in some cases there are no auxiliary elds. if x is at space, then
the formulas (1.26) are well-dened as written. if x is curved, however, then the
outermost d in the denition of f acts on a section of the nontrivial bundle t x,
and we use a covariant derivative to dene the action of d. in the simplest super-
symmetric -models x is riemannian and we use the pullback of the levi-civita
connection. in other models dierent connections on t x (e.g. with torsion) might
be more convenient. in gauge theories we meet superelds  which are sections of
nontrivialized bundles associated to the principal bundle14 p. a typical example
is the adjoint bundle. since one of the elds in the theory is a connection a on p,
we use it to dene derivatives of . our covariant denitions of component elds
are globalwe never choose coordinate systems or local trivializations.

component elds are dened in terms of the left-invariant vector elds d. la-
grangian densities on superspace are also written in terms of d. recall that a
lagrangian density l is a section of dens m  f  m , where f is the super-
manifold of superelds and dens m the density bundle of m , pulled back over the
product. let a be odd parameters. then the element aqa induces an even vector
eld  on f  m . the corresponding one-parameter group combines the motion
on m with the inverse15 pullback on elds. we now give a general argument that
the lagrangians we construct are invariant under . first, note that in our two
examplesa -model with eld  : m  x and a gauge theory with connection a
on a principal bundle p  m over super minkowski spacethe connection a we
use to dene the action of d on superelds depends on the eld, so is best thought
of as living on f  m . for example, in the -model a is the pullback of the
levi-civita connection on t x by the evaluation map f  m  x. in the gauge
theory a is the natural universal connection on p  f  m which is at in the
f direction. now for the -model a is canonically trivial along the orbits of ,
since  is tangent to the bers of the evaluation map. hence the actions of  and d
on superelds via the connection a do (super)commute. in the gauge theory case
the same statement is true up to gauge transformations, as the reader may verify
with some computation (cf. the last remark in [i-classical fields, 4.2]). there-
fore, if l is a gauge-invariant lagrangian density constructed from derivatives of
superelds by the ds, then l is invariant under . this is the statement that l is
supersymmetric.

next, we derive the general shape of the formula for the action of aqa on

component elds. we denote a typical component eld as

(1.27)

f = idr.

implicit in the notation is that d acts by covariant derivative where necessary. now
aqa generates a dieomorphism exp(aqa ) of m , and we dene16 f to be the

14in other places we call a principal g bundle a g-torsor.
15we use pullback by the inverse to achieve a left action on functions. this introduces a minus
sign into the innitesimal action of vector elds on functions. for example,  acts on functions
by minus the indicated derivative.
16usually,  is denoted as , but since we use  as the dierential along f , we avoid this
notation.

14

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

change in the component f under this dieomorphism acting on  by the inverse
pullback:

(1.28)

f :=

d

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0 idr(cid:0)exp(taqa )(cid:1).

we write d/dt to indicate that we may have to use a covariant derivative to
dierentiate in t. to compute (1.28) we use the fact that exp(taqa ) preserves d
and so

(1.29)

f =

d

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0 i exp(taqa )(dr)
= aiqa dr
= aidadr.

at the last stage we use the fact that qa and da agree when restricted to m . in
practice we use (1.29) and the commutation relations among the ds to express f
in terms of other component elds.

with our sign conventions, the innitesimal symmetry p acts on a component

eld f by f .
the supersymmetry transformations (1.29) on components obey the commu-
tation relations derived from those of the vector elds q if there are no covariant
derivatives. explicitly, if 1, 2 are odd parameters and i the vector eld which
corresponds to a

i qa, then17

(1.30)

[ 1, 2]f = 2a

abf.

the same is true for nonlinear -models, but in gauge theory these commutation
relations may be altered by curvature terms which act as innitesimal gauge trans-
formations.

the most straightforward way to dene a component lagrangian for the com-
ponent elds on m , starting from a lagrangian l in superspace, is to integrate l
over the odd variables using the splitting (1.20). in other words, the splitting (1.20)
determines a projection

(1.31)

and so an integration

 : m  m

(1.32)

 : dens(m )  dens( m )

on densities. however, we nd better formulas in certain cases by a procedure
which diers from this by an exact term. first, the metric on the vector space v
determines a canonical positive density |dnx| on minkowski space m ; it is invariant
17in the abstract supersymmetry algebra we have [a
abp.
there are two minus signs which cancel in passing to (1.30): a minus sign for brackets since we
use left actions, and the minus sign in the action of p. (see 5 of [i-signs].)

under the poincare group. similarly, if we x a volume form18 on s, then to-
gether with the metric on v this determines a canonical density |dnx| ds on super
minkowski space m ; it is invariant under the super poincare group. we dene a
lagrangian function  on m by

(1.33)

l = |dnx| ds .

then we dene the component lagrangian density |dnx| l on minkowski space m
by applying some denite combination of d operators, which we symbolically de-
note ds, to  and then restricting to m :

(1.34)

|dnx| l = |dnx| (ids).

notice that the component lagrangian function l is naturally expressed in terms
of component elds. often ids is chosen to agree with integration over the odd
variables in the splitting (1.20), but in some cases not. for an example of the former
(on m 3|2) see (2.40); for an example of the latter (on m 4|4) see the discussion
following (2.72). in any case we suppose there is a poincare invariant dierential
operator  on m such that

(1.35)

l = |dnx| (ids + i)

= |dnx| ( l + i).

for integration on m 4|4 this is formula (2.71).

theorem 1.36. the component lagrangian (1.34) is supersymmetric.
here the supersymmetry is nonmanifest so that lie( )(|dnx| l) is a nonzero exact
form, where  is dened in (1.29).

proof. the verication is easy if the component lagrangian is dened by ordinary
integration (1.32), i.e., if  = 0 in (1.35):

(1.37)

lie( )(cid:0)|dnx| l(cid:1) = lie( )(l)

= (cid:0)lie(aqa )l(cid:1)
= (cid:0)d(aqa )l(cid:1)
= dn(cid:0)(aqa )l(cid:1)o,

if  = 0.

in this computation lie denotes the lie derivative, and we use the cartan formula
lie() = d() + ()d to dene the integral density 19 (aqa )l. even if  6= 0 we
use (1.35) to rewrite this last expression. first, use (1.31) to lift |dnx| to m , where
18neither the superspace lagrangian l nor the component lagrangian function l depends on this
volume form; only the superspace lagrangian function  in (1.33) and the choice of ds in (1.34)
depend on it.
19see [i-supersymmetry, 3.93.12] for an explanation of integral forms and integral densities.

16

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

we view it as a twisted dierential form (twisted by the orientation bundle). then

= dnids(cid:0)(aqa)|dnx| (cid:1)o.

abb)|dnx| (cid:1)o

in the penultimate step we use the fact that ib = 0. now if  6= 0 we write
(1.39)

 = 

for some constant dierential operators . the expression (1.39) is not in general
unique. now

(1.40)

lie( )(cid:0)|dnx| i(cid:1) = |dnx| i(aqa )
= |dnx| i(ada)
= dn()|dnx| i(ada)o.

putting together (1.35), (1.37), (1.38), and (1.40) we have the desired result

(1.41)

(1.42)

lie( )(cid:0)|dnx| l(cid:1) = dnids(cid:0)(aqa)|dnx| (cid:1)  ()|dnx| i(ada)o
abids(ab) + i(ada)(cid:1)o.

= dn()|dnx|(cid:0)

equation (1.41) gives one contribution to the supercurrent , which is minus the
noether current for the supersymmetry transformation .
if  6= 0, then the
supercurrent we derive from these formulas depends on the choice we make in (1.39).
we sometimes dene (a term in) a lagrangian on m simply by restricting a

scalar supereld s on m to minkowski space m :

(1.43)

l = is.

of course, (1.34) is of this form with s = ds. in general (1.43) is not supersym-
metric. put dierently, only in special cases does the assumption that s = 0 on m
imply that lie( )(|dnx| l) is exact.
for some theories there is no (known) superspace formulation and we work
directly in components. then the supersymmetry transformation is dened di-
rectly on the component elds and a direct computation is needed to verify that a
(component) lagrangian is supersymmetric.

1.3. a simple example20

here we consider a supersymmetric version of a particle moving on a line. con-
sider m 1|1 with coordinates t, . the basic odd vector elds are

(1.44)

d =   t
q =  + t,

with [d, d] = 2t and [q, q] = 2t. a supereld  : m 1|1  r has components

(1.45)

 = i,
 = id.

then for  corresponding to aqa we have, according to (1.29),

(1.46)

 = id = ,
 = id2 =  ,

where  = t. we check the bracketing in the simplest case:

(1.47)

( 1 2  2 1) = 1(2)  2(1)

= 2 1 + 1 2
= 21  + 12 
= 212 .

this is consistent with (1.30).21

a fundamental lagrangian for the eld  is

l = |dt| dn

dto.

20further analysis of this example appears in problem fp2 of [i-homework].
21it is important to use the odd parameter  in these computations. if we write informally

(1.48)

(t, ) = (t) + (t),

then the action of q is
(1.49)

q(t, ) = (t)   (t),

from which we might erroneously conclude

(1.50)

(q) = ,
(q) =  .

multiplying by  we do not obtain (1.46). rather, instead of (1.49) we should write

(1.51)

(q)(t, ) = (t) +  (t)

and correctly deduce (1.46). the process of taking components involves odd derivatives; the odd
parameter  protects us from making a sign mistake.

chapter 2
coordinates on superspace

our task in this chapter is to develop the formalism we need to compute in
our main examples: the super minkowski spaces m 3|2, m 4|4, and m 6|(8,0). most of
the formulas we derive also apply to dierential geometric computations (including
spinors) in 3-, 4-, and 6-dimensional ordinary minkowski space. the entire treat-
ment is based on the exceptional isomorphism of lie groups in low dimensions, as
explained in 2.1. after a brief interlude (2.2) on dimensional reduction, we ush
out the denitions into concrete formulas (2.32.5). the nal section 2.6 records
some specializations to dimension 2.

2.1. m 3|2, m 4|4, m 6|(8,0) and their complexications

we consider the cases n = dim(v ) = 3, 4, 6 with minimal supersymmetry. the
irreducible real spinorial representation s of spin(v ) is respectively of dimension 2,
4, and 8, with algebra of endomorphisms d respectively reduced to r (n = 3) or
isomorphic to c (n = 4) or h (n = 6). once  is chosen, v can be identied with
the space of d-hermitian symmetric sesquilinear forms on homd(s, d), with the
positive cone c corresponding to positive forms. namely, as will be clear from the
complexied description, there is up to a real factor a unique symmetric morphism
of representations  : s  s  v , and (as, t) = (s, at) for a  d. it induces
an isomorphism of the symmetric quotient of s d s with v . this symmetric
quotient is identied with the space of hermitian symmetric sesquilinear forms
on homd(s, d) by letting ss correspond to the form for which h, i = (s)(s).
for v of dimension 4 (resp. 6) we choose an isomorphism of d with c (resp. h).
on the super minkowski space m , the odd distribution  then carries a c- (resp
left h-) module structure, and this structure is respected by the super poincare
group.

over c one has the exceptional isomorphisms spin(3) = sl(2), spin(4) =
sl(2)  sl(2), and spin(6) = sl(4). they make it convenient to describe the
complexication vc of v starting from that of s. the real form v corresponds to
a complex conjugation (antilinear automorphism) of vc.

after complexication h becomes isomorphic to the 2 2 matrix algebra. this
enables us to x a 2-dimensional complex vector space w , a pseudoreal (or quater-
nionic) structure on w (that is, an antilinear automorphism j of square 1) and
an isomorphism of h with the ring of real endomorphisms of w , where real means
commuting with j. we take these endomorphisms to act on the right. the model

19

20

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

is w = h, the complex structure given by left multiplication by i  h, the
pseudoreal structure given by left multiplication by j  h. the real endomor-
phisms are the right multiplications by elements of h. we x on w a symplec-
tic form w which is real, i.e., w (jx, jy) = w (x, y), and positive denite, i.e.,
w (x, jx) > 0 for x 6= 0. note that w (x, jx) is real since w is. we also x a
basis {e, e = j(e)} of w for which w (e, e) = 1 and for which the h-module
multiplication by z  c  h is the multiplication by z on e and by z on e. in the
model w = h introduced above, one may take e = 1, e = j.
we now describe, case by case, the complexications sc and vc of s and v , the
symmetric morphism  : s
c  vc, the d-module structure of sc, and spin(v ).
for m 3|2 and m 4|4 we give a duality pairing  : scsc  c. in these cases the form
 : sc  sc  vc is constructed using (1.9). (we write the formulas in coordinates
below.) for m 6|(8,0) there is no duality pairing and we specify  explicitly.
3|2 case. here there is no need to complexify to have a nice description, so we
directly describe the real superspace. let s be a 2-dimensional real vector space

second arrow is constructed from the duality (2.5). to make (1.3) valid, we dene

the metric g on vc to be such that the inverse metric g1 on v2s0 is /2.

in the 6|(8, 0) and 4|4 cases we now describe the real spaces v and s as xed
points of an antilinear involution of vc and sc. the real structures must be com-
patible with  as well as with the symmetric bilinear form g on vc. the induced
form on v is to have signature (1, n 1). the real description above of the 3|2 case
does give the required signature (1, 2).

if the volume form  on s0 is real, the corresponding quadratic form on the real
form of v has signature (1, 5) or (5, 1). we want (, j) to give signature (1, 5). this

is the case if, for a basis of s0 of the form {s, j(s), t, j(t)}, one has (cid:0)sj(s)tj(t)(cid:1)
2.2. dimensional reduction
the super lie algebras v 3  s2 and v 4  s4 underlying m 3|2 and m 4|4 are related
as follows. any (real) isomorphism  : c r s2  s4 extends to  : v 3  v 4.
the image (v 3) is the orthogonal complement to a one-dimensional spacelike
subspace t  v 4. this denes embeddings

notice that the left translates of s form a two-dimensional integrable odd distri-
bution  on m 3|4, and the composition of (2.9) with the quotient map

(2.10)

is an isomorphism.

similarly, for the super lie algebras v 4  s4 and v 6  s8 underlying m 4|4
and m 6|(8,0), any isomorphism  : h c s4  s8 extends to  : v 4  v 6. the
image (v 4)  v 6 is the orthogonal complement to a two-dimensional spacelike

we also introduce the dirac operator

it is convenient in our gauge theory computations to work with the hodge

2.4. coordinates on m 4|4
we x a basis {fa}a=1,2 of s and let { f a} be the complex conjugate basis of s.
as a basis for vc = s s we use {eab = fa fb}. those bases and their duals give
us a complex coordinate system {yab, a,  a}, with a and  a complex conjugate and
yab the complex conjugate to yb a. we write a,  a, and ab for the corresponding
vector elds. note our convention about indices: if both a and  a appear in the
same equation, then a = a. this allows us to write reality conditions and equations
such as (2.78) and (2.79).

let da and d a be the left-invariant complex vector elds corresponding to fa

and f a. one has

the density |d4x| in (1.33) is the standard positive density

|d4x| = |dx0dx1dx2dx3|.

to dene self-duality we need to orient m 4, and so we stipulate that x0, x1, x2, x3

is an oriented coordinate system.25 then for a symmetric tensor fab the 2-form

fab c d a c  b d

is self-dual, and for a symmetric tensor f c d the 2-form

(2.65)

1
2

abf c d a c  b d

is anti-self-dual. our convention is that a self-dual 2-form  satises  = 1 .

then the analytic continuation to euclidean space gives the usual notion of self-
duality. the complex conjugate of a self-dual form (in minkowski space) is anti-
self-dual.

for the 2-form

(2.66)

we have the formulas

(fab c d + abf c d) a c  b d

where d4x is the standard volume form

(2.68)

d4x = dx0  dx1  dx2  dx3.

in general the 2-form f is complex; then |f|2 in (2.67) is not a norm, but rather
is a quadratic form. the 2-form f is real if f ab = fab.
we mention the fact that the analytic continuation of the  operator on 2-forms
in minkowski space of any dimension is 1 times the  operator on 2-forms in

euclidean space.

da = 0.

25the orientation only serves to choose which of (2.64) and (2.65) below is self-dual and which is
anti-self-dual. it does not enter in a fundamental way in our formulae.

we discuss the meaning of r d2 and r d2  in 5.3; in any case we compute them

in each of the last two lines the term in braces disagrees with the integral by a
multiple of the wave operator. in a lagrangian this wave operator gives an exact
term which is usually omitted anyway. the particular combination of derivatives in
the rst term of (2.71) has the virtue that it exactly annihilates chiral and antichiral
superelds. this is an advantage over the usual integral and leads to nicer formulas.
hence we compute component lagrangians (1.34) using this improved expression,
which is the usual integral plus the wave operator composed with restriction to v .
formula (2.72) is useful in some computations. both of these integration formulas
follow from direct computation.

dimensional reduction.

there is an r-symmetry group su (2)r which acts on m 6|(8,0). the action of

a matrix s = (sj

i ) is

(2.102)

dai  dai si
i .

demanding that this preserve (2.83) requires s  sl(2; c); asking that the real
structure also be preserved reduces us to su (2). more conceptually, this su (2)r =
sp(1)r symmetry group is the group of real endomorphisms of the complex sym-
plectic vector space w .

there is also a dimensional reduction map m 4|8  m 6|(8,0), described simply
a , d a(j)} a=1,2

by equations (2.101). usually m 4|8 is described with vector elds {d(i)

i,j=1,2

with bracketing (2.46) supplemented by a -function:

(2.103)

[d(i)

a , d a(j)] = 2i

ja a.

one possible correspondence between these vector elds and the { dai} a=1,2,3,4

i=1,2

is:

(2.104)

d11 = d(1)
1
d21 = d(1)
2
d31 = d 1(2)
d41 = d 2(2)

d12 = d(2)
1
d22 = d(2)
2
d32 = d 1(1)
d42 = d 2(1)

a new feature of m 4|8 is an enlarged r-symmetry group u (2)r. it acts trivially
on the even variables. the representation of u (2)r on each of the pairs {d(1)
a , d(2)
a }
of odd vector elds is the standard one, whereas on each of the pairs {d a(1), d a(2)}
of odd vector elds u (2)r acts by the conjugate to the standard action. under the
dimensional reduction m 4|4  m 4|(8,0), specied by (2.100), only the subgroup
u (1)r  u (2)r given by (2.81) survives. notice that this subgroup is the induced
action by the double cover in the spin group of rotations in the x4-x5 plane.

2.6. low dimensions
the basic superspace m 1|1 in dimension one is built starting from a one-dimensional
odd space s and letting v = s(2). in terms of the obvious left-invariant vector
elds d and  we have

(2.105)

[d, d] = 2.

analogs of other formulas we have developed above are easy to come by. dimen-
sional reduction from the higher dimensional spaces sets all spacelike coordinates

34

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

of minkowski space to zero leaving just the time coordinate x0. in this way we
also obtain spaces m 1|2, m 1|4, and m 1|8 with more odd variables. as these spaces
are reduced from m 3|2, m 4|4, and m 6|(8,0), we obtain r-symmetry groups spin(2),
spin(3), and spin(5) from rotations in the additional spatial directions.

the basic26 superspace m 2|(1,1) in dimension two is simply a product

(2.106)

m 2|(1,1) = m 1|1  m 1|1.

(note that the metric (2.109) is not a product, however.) this corresponds to the
fact that there are real semi-spinors in 2 dimensions (termed majorana-weyl spinors
in the physics literature). for s+, s real one-dimensional vector spaces, we set
s = s+  s and v = (s+)(2)  (s)(2) with the obvious bilinear pairing.
in m 3|2 set
we can see m 2|(1,1) as coming from m 3|2 by dimensional reduction:
y12 = 0. it is customary to use + for the odd index 1 and  for the odd index 2.
(these indices appear beginning with formula (2.15).) also, we set y+ = y11 and
y = y22 with similar notation + = 11 and  = 22.

n = 2 superspace in 2 dimensions is m 2|(2,2), and we view it as embedded
in m 4|4 (dimensional reduction) by setting y1 2 = y2 1 = 0, or equivalently x2 =
x3 = 0. the real description of m 2|(1,1) makes clear that there is also a real
description of m 2|(2,2), but we use the complex vector elds and forms induced
from m 4|4 instead. again we use + for the odd index 1 and  for the odd

bosonic coordinates are the usual lightcone coordinates in two dimensions. thus
the left-invariant odd vector elds are d+, d+, d, d, and we denote the left-
invariant even vector elds by +, . the bracketing relations are

[d+, d+] = [d+, d] = [d+, d] = [d+, d+] = 0

[d, d] = [d+, d] = [d, d+] = [d, d] = 0

[d+, d+] = 2+
[d, d] = 2.

the formulas in m 4|4 all apply, though many simplify. for example, the met-

the r-symmetry (2.81) in m 4|4 induces j+ + j on m 2|(2,2). the double cover in
the spin group of rotation in the x2-x3 plane in m 4|4 induces the r-symmetry j+
j of m 2|(2,2).

as in m 4|4, a complex function  : m 2|(2,2)  c is chiral if

(2.118)

d+ = d = 0;

then the complex conjugate  is antichiral . there is a new possibility as well.
namely, a complex function  : m 2|(2,2)  c is twisted chiral if
(2.119)

d+ = d = 0;

then the complex conjugate  is twisted antichiral.

formulas (2.71) and (2.72) for computingr d4 are, of course, valid on m 2|(2,2).
again we use r d4 + (cid:3)i to compute component lagrangians when chiral and an-
involved, it is more convenient to use r d4  (cid:3)i, which equals the rst term

tichiral elds are involved. when twisted chiral and twisted antichiral elds are

in (2.72). this has the advantage that the expression d2d
d2 annihilates
both twisted chiral and twisted antichiral elds. in a more complicated (term in a)
lagrangian involving both chiral and twisted chiral elds one would have to simply
choose a procedure and then deal with the exact terms which would most likely
appear.

chapter 3
supersymmetric -models

a scalar eld is a map  : m n  x from ordinary n-dimensional minkowski
space to a manifold x. if x is a linear space, then a theory with the eld  is called
a linear -model; if x is curved, then it is a nonlinear -model. in supersymmetric
-models there is in addition a spinor eld. after some linear algebra preliminaries
in 3.1, we begin in 3.2 with the linear case, where we show that a supersym-
metric extension of the ordinary free -model exists in dimensions n = 3, 4, 6. we
label these three cases according to the ring f = r, c, h which underlies the spin
group sl(2, f). in the nonlinear case (x a general riemannian manifold) super-
symmetry imposes constraints on the target manifold x: for f = c it must be
kahler and for f = h it must be hyperkahler. the suciency of these constraints
is explained at the beginning of 3.3, after which we derive the exact form of the
component lagrangian.
in the bosonic case any function v : x  r may serve
as a potential energy function, but supersymmetry constrains the form of v . the
constraints are described in 3.4, though the proofs are deferred to future chapters.
we make some brief remarks about the superspace formulation in 3.5 and about
the relationship among the dierent theories in 3.6.
3.1. preliminary remarks on linear algebra
we discuss simultaneously the elds f = r, c, h. since h is noncommutative,
we must be careful about the order of multiplication. let  denote the standard
conjugation on f, which is trivial for f = r. for x, y  f we have
(3.1)

xy = y x.

the extension of (3.1) to superalgebra has a sign, in accordance with the sign rule.
it is useful to note that:

(3.2)

re() = re() = re() = re(),

,   f.

let v be the vector space of translations of m n (n = 3, 4, 6).

if s is an
irreducible real spinorial representation of spin(v ), the eld f of endomorphisms
of the representation s is respectively isomorphic to r, c, or h; the vector space s
is of dimension 2 over f; and spin(v ) = slf(s). we choose s and a right vector
space structure over f = r, c or h commuting with the action of spin(v ). the
dual s = homf(s, f) is then a left f-vector space, and spin(v ) = slf(s) as

36

chapter 3. supersymmetric -models

37

well. we write s for s with the left vector space structure s := s and s for s
with the right vector space structure s := s. the f-dual s can be identied
with the r-dual homr(s, r) by  7 real part of the f-linear form . if {f a} is a
basis of s over f, then there are induced bases { f a}, {fa}, { f a} of s, s, s.
as explained at the beginning of 2.1 there are invariant symmetric r-bilinear
forms  : s r s  v and  : s r s  v . they factor through s f s and
s f s, respectively. in general, if a, b, c are respectively f right, f left, r vector
spaces, then an r-linear map t : a f b  c gives rise to an (f, f)-bilinear form
t1 : a r b  c r f, characterized by
(3.3)

t (a, b) = re(cid:0)t1(a, b)(cid:1).

conversely, the real part of any (f, f)-bilinear t1 obeys

re t1(a, b) = re t1(a, b) = re t1(a, b) = re t1(a, b),

(3.4)
so factors through a f b. we apply this construction to  and , and denote
by 
and  ab the coordinates of 1 and 1 in bases {e} of v and {f a} of s,
ab
up to a factor:

(3.5)

here  is the factor

b axa) e,

(f axa, f byb) =

re(yb baxa) e.

 =(cid:26) 1,

f = r;

2, f = c, h.

on the left hand side of these equations, ,  denote the real forms acting on
elements of the underlying real vector space. thus, for example, we might write

(cid:0)re(xafa), re(ybfb)(cid:1) to distinguish it from (2.52). the factor of 2 is introduced

to make these formulas compatible with (2.52) and similar formulas of chapter 2.
the symmetry of  and  becomes the hermiticity property

the cliord relation (1.3) with this normalization is

and its conjugate. we emphasize that 
ab

,  ab lie in f, whereas g, g are real.
for the quaternion case f = h we can choose bases so that the pairing  is

given by

(3.9)

0
1 1 = 1, 1
0
2 2 = 1, 1
2
1 2 = 1, 3

1 1 = 1,
2 2 = 1,
1 2 = i, 4

1 2 = j, 5

1 2 = k,

38

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

where i, j, k are the usual quaternions. then the pairing  is given by

(3.10)

1 11 = 1,
1 22 = 1,

0 11 = 1,
0 22 = 1,
2 21 = 1, 3 21 = i, 4 21 = j, 5 21 = k.

in this basis the metric has the standard form (2.98). it is useful to note that the
vector (fa, fa) is lightlike (has vanishing norm square) for all a; this property will
be important in chapter 6. the pairings for the complex case f = c are obtained
by omitting the entries with j, k; those for the real case f = r by taking the real
part of all entries. then the chosen bases agree with those in 2.3, 2.4. recall
from (1.9) that for f = r, c we have a skew tensor , and the pairings  and  are
related by

(3.11)

ba = 
c d

ac

b d,

f = r, c.

in 3.3 we have use for the following. suppose vr is a right h vector space
and vl a left h vector space. suppose  is a symmetric real-valued bilinear form
on vr which factors through vr h vr and h a symmetric real-valued bilinear form
on vl which factors through vl h vl. then we claim that there is a well-dened
symmetric real bilinear form b on the real vector space v = vr h vl constructed
from , h. in fact, if 1, h1 are the h-valued pairings constructed as in (3.3), then
(3.12) b(f  v, f   v) = ren1(f, f ) h1(v, v)o,

f, f   vr,

v, v  vl.

we easily check that this factors through the quaternionic tensor product us-
ing (3.2). relative to bases {f a} of vr and vi of vl, any vector in v can be
written

(3.13)

f ai

a  vi = f a  i

then the formula for b is

3.2. the free supersymmetric -model
the bosonic -model lagrangian in n-dimensional minkowski space m n for a scalar
eld  : m n  x with values in a riemannian manifold x is

(3.15)

l =

1
2|d|2 |dnx|.

we look for supersymmetric extensions with various amounts of supersymmetry.
with a single supersymmetry the supersymmetric extension for n = 1 is given
in (1.53). (that lagrangian is in m 1, but in fact it is the dimensional reduction
of a lagrangian in m 2; see problem fp6 of [i-homework].) to construct models
with more supersymmetry we rst consider the linear case x = rk for some k;
in the next subsection we treat nonlinear -models. the linear model is free, and

chapter 3. supersymmetric -models

39

to predict which supersymmetric extensions exist we invoke an argument from
the quantum theory. namely, upon quantization we obtain a representation of
the supersymmetry algebra, and the representation theory shows that models are
possible with s = 2, 4, 8 supersymmetries for k = 1, 2, 4. that is, the smallest
model has a scalar eld in rk for k = 1, 2, 4 and a single spinor eld. the maximal
dimension in which such models can occur is n = 3, 4, 6, and the models in these
dimensions have minimal supersymmetry.

we refer to the theories in n = 3, 4, 6 according to the eld f = r, c, h.
to treat the various cases simultaneously, we introduce constants  in (3.6) and

(3.16)

a =(cid:26) 1

2 , f = r;
1, f = c, h.

(the constant a enters the lagrangian (3.19) and the constant  enters the super-
symmetry transformation laws (3.23), as well as (3.5) above.)

the elds in the theory are

(3.17)

 : m n  f
 : m n  s,

where  denotes parity reversal. (the spinor eld  is odd.)

theorem 3.18. the -model lagrangian

(3.19)

l = anhd, d i + re(d/ )o |dnx|

is supersymmetric in the three cases f = r, c, h.

we can combine the two fermion terms at the cost of an exact term. for odd

corresponds to the abstract supersymmetry transformation

where  a = a. (recall the abstract supersymmetry algebra (1.16).) we postulate

(3.20)

(f aa, f bb) = (f bb, f aa) = re(  a  abb) = re(a ba b).

and of course we have the conjugate equations

  a = 

(3.24)

b a b   .

there is a minus sign in passing from  to   since we commute the odd quan-
tities a and a. these formulas are motivated by lorentz invariance, parity, and
power counting.

we must check that lie( )l is exact and that the transformations (3.23) gen-
erate the supersymmetry algebra on-shell.28 the variation of the bosonic term in l
is

(3.25)

(ag    ) = ag{a a      a   a}.

the second term in (3.21) has variation

adding (3.26) and (3.27) and using the cliord relation (3.8) we see

(3.28)

where

g{  a   a  a a  } + exact,

the nonexact term in (3.28) cancels against (3.25), which proves that  is a non-
manifest symmetry of l.

we now verify that the supersymmetry algebra holds on-shell. the vector
eld (3.22) is 2 re(aqa), and in the abstract supersymmetry algebra (1.16) we
have, according to (3.5),

(3.30)

(cid:2)re(a

28by contrast, in one dimension (1.47) holds everywhere, that is, o-shell. we can achieve o-shell
supersymmetry for f = r, c by introducing an auxiliary eld; see 4.1 and 5.1.

as desired. for  we must use the equation of motion (3.39), which appears below.
using (3.10) we write this equation as

(3.34)

01  11 = 22  32i + 42j + 52k,
02 + 12 = 21 + 31i  41j  51k.

the action of the supersymmetry transformation on  is

(recall the factor 2/2 in (3.22).) as a check, in the case f = r this reduces in one
dimension with one supersymmetry to (1.57). other formulas from that section
also check against those here.

3.3. nonlinear supersymmetric -model
now consider the supersymmetric -model of the previous subsection where we
replace the target x by a curved riemannian manifold. then  transforms as an
element of the pullback tangent bundle, and it is easy to see that dim x is divisible
by dim f if the linearization is to reduce to the linear -model. but more is true:
to write formulas (3.23) we need to be able to multiply tangent vectors in x by
elements of f. thus we assume that t x is endowed with a left f-structure. of
course, this is no extra condition for f = r. for f = c, h the f multiplication is
a tensor eld on x (which is called an almost complex structure for f = c). let
t denote the covariant derivative of this tensor. then x is kahler (f = c) or
hyperkahler (f = h) if and only if t vanishes. the elds in the theory are now

(3.44)

  c( m n, x)
  c( m n, s f t x).

the lagrangian (3.19) continues to make sense if we use the riemannian metric h
on t x as well as the levi-civita covariant derivative . but for  to be well-
dened on t x as an f-bundle, we need t to vanish. therefore, we now assume
that x is kahler for f = c and that x is hyperkahler for f = h. for f = h we
explained above that if {vi} is a basis of t x at some point, then the riemannian

note the use of angle brackets on the left hand side to denote the inner product
on t x. the supersymmetry transformation laws are the same as for the linear
case.29 we often omit  and  from the notation.

we explain (3.49), where we have switched from the quaternionic notation used
previously to a complex notation. the complexication of the tangent bundle of a
hyperkahler manifold x of real dimension 4n can be written

(3.51)

tcx = v  w ,

where v is a complex vector bundle of complex rank 2n and w  is the dual of
the xed complex symplectic vector space described at the beginning of 2.1. fur-
thermore, v carries a pseudoreal (quaternionic) structure j and a skew-symmetric

bilinear form h which encodes the metric. the complexied riemann curvature
tensor, viewed as a functional on (tcx)4 = v 4, is a totally symmetric tensor .
let s be the real spin representation of spin(1, 5). as described in 2.1, its com-
plexication is s0  w for a 4-dimensional complex vector space s0. the spinor
eld  is a real odd section of v c s0. note there is a trace map
(tcx)  sc = (v  w )  (s0  w )  v  s0
(3.52)

which expresses the quaternionic tensor product in (3.44). (all tensor products
in (3.52) are over c.) the pseudoreal structures on s0 and v give a real structure
on v  s0. recall that s0 carries a volume form . now x a local framing of v
(indices , , = 1, . . . , 2n), a basis of w (indices i, j, = 1, 2), and a basis of s0
(indices a, b, = 1, 2, 3, 4). the inner product of two tangent vectors 1, 2 is

proof of theorem 3.46. we review the proof of theorem 3.18 to determine what
changes when x is curved. (in this paragraph only we use quaternionic notation
for the f = h case.) the variation of the lagrangian l has a new contribution
from varying the covariant derivative in the fermion kinetic term, and this cancels
the variation of the curvature term. we do this computation presently, but rst we
examine changes in the previous computations. for f = r they are unaltered except
for the substitution of covariant derivatives. but for f = c, h our assumption that
x is kahler, hyperkahler is crucial. for in the integration by parts formula (3.26)
there is an extra term from dierentiating the f-structure:

the subscript on  indicates that we only vary the fermion; the variation of  is
computed below in (3.60). we also pick up the conjugate terms in (3.27). our
assumption on x is that t = 0, so that this extra term does not appear. with
this assumption the verication of the supersymmetry algebra also goes through as
before.

we turn to the variation of the covariant derivative and the curvature term.
here it is easier to proceed on a case-by-case basis. first, consider f = r so that
x is any riemannian manifold. let r denote the riemann curvature tensor. fix
a basis {vi} of t x at a point. then as usual we write

(3.58)

rijk = hvi, r(vk, v)vji.

the curvature tensor obeys certain symmetries and satises the bianchi identity:

(3.59)

rijk = rjik = rijk = rkij
rijk + rjki + rkij = 0.

to complete the verication that (3.47) is supersymmetric, we check that the

variation in  of the curvature term vanishes:

(3.66)

(cid:0)abcdha, r(b, c)di(cid:1) = abcdeha, (e r)(b, c)di.

now the symmetries of r and the (second) bianchi identity imply that the ex-
pression ha, (e r)(b, c)di is symmetric in a, d and in b, c, e. in addition, it
is symmetric under the interchange a, d  b, c. altogether this implies that it is
totally symmetric in a, b, c, d, e, whence (3.66) vanishes. this completes the proof
for f = r.

next, consider f = c. thus x is kahler and we work with the complexied
tangent bundle as usual. we consider a to be a complex vector of type (1, 0). the
riemann curvature tensor is of type (1, 1). if {vi} is a basis of type (1, 0) vectors
at a point of x, we write

(3.67)

rijk = hvi, r(vk, v)vji.

then the symmetries of the curvature tensor are

(3.68)

rijk = rkji = rikj = rjik = rij k.

this cancels (3.69) as claimed.

to complete the proof that (3.48) is supersymmetric, we verify that the varia-

tion in  of the curvature term vanishes:

(cid:0)ac

b dha, r(c,  d) bi(cid:1) = ac

b deha, (e r)(c,  d) bi
 ac

b d eddha, ( e r)(c,  d) bi.

the bianchi identity implies that the factor ha, (e r)(c,  d) bi in the rst term
is symmetric in e, c. combining with (3.68) we see that it is symmetric in a, e, c.
hence the rst term vanishes. the argument for the second term is similar.

finally, consider f = h. the variation in  of the fermion kinetic term in (3.49)

as in the previous cases, we complete the proof by showing that the variation

in  of the curvature term vanishes. that variation is a multiple of

(cid:0)abcd(a, b, c, d)(cid:1) = abcdei(ei

)(a, b, c, d).

)(a, b, c, d) is
now the bianchi identity and the symmetry of  imply that (ei
totally skew in a, b, c, d, e. since the skew-symmetrization of abcdei vanishes
(dim s0 = 4), the entire expression (3.75) vanishes.

in the nonlinear model the formulas (3.40) and (3.43) for the variational 1-
form and the supercurrent are replaced by the covariant versions; that is, we use
covariant derivatives in place of ordinary derivatives. we do not bother recording
them here; see theorem 6.33. the equations of motion (3.41) are aected in a more
drastic waythe right hand sides are nonzero expressions in the curvature and its
covariant derivative. they vanish if we set  = 0. (in fact, the terms are quadratic,
cubic, and quartic in .) the interested reader can work out the precise formulas,
some of which appear in 4 and 5.
3.4. supersymmetric potential terms
to the bosonic -model lagrangian (3.15) with target x we can add a potential
term. let

(3.76)

v : x  r

be a real-valued function, called the potential energy. we assume that v is bounded
below. then the bosonic lagrangian with potential is

(3.77)

l =n 1

2|d|2  vo |dnx|.

chapter 3. supersymmetric -models

49

the moduli space of classical vacua for this theorythat is, the space of static eld
congurations of minimal energyis

(3.78)

mvac = v 1(0)

if we assume that the minimum value of v occurs at 0.

now we consider supersymmetric extensions of (3.77). one basic principle,
which follows from the supersymmetry algebra, is that in a supersymmetric theory
the potential energy is nonnegative. that is manifest in our formulas below. our
starting point is the nonlinear -models developed in the previous section.

we will not carry out a detailed analysis in components, but rather content
ourselves with pointing out a few elementary features. first, note that the variation
of the potential term is, using (3.23),

(3.79)

(v ) = a(cid:0)dv (a)(cid:1).

thus there must be an additional term in the lagrangian to cancel this. power
countingthat is, weighting the boson 0, the fermion 1/2, and a spacetime deriva-
tive 1shows that in addition we must change the supersymmetry transformation
law (3.23) for the fermion. the form of the new transformation is

(3.80)

a = 
ab

b  + abbfa


for some vector elds fa on x, and the additional term in the lagrangian takes the
form

(3.81)

aab(a, b)

for some bilinear forms aab on x. imposing the condition that the lagrangian be
supersymmetric gives relations among v, aab, fa. in fact, one can analyze those
conditions in the dimensional reduction of the models to one spacetime dimension.
such an analysis leads to the form of the lagrangians in the following result.
theorem 3.82. (i) (f = r) let x be a riemannian manifold and h : x  r a
real function. then the lagrangian

here hess h is the covariant hessian

hess w = w.

the double bars denote the hermitian norm:

(3.89)

k grad wk2 = hgrad w , grad wi.

for f = r the potential energy is

(3.90)

for f = c it is

(3.91)

vc = k grad wk2.

in both cases it is nonnegative. the function w is called the superpotential . the

(3.92)

for f = r and

(3.93)

mr

vac = crit(h)

vac = crit(w )

for f = c. here crit denotes the set of critical points.

we defer the proof of theorem 3.82 to 4 and 5, where we give a manifestly
supersymmetric version in superspace. there we also derive the supercurrent for
the model with potential.

for the f = h case there is no way to add a potential energy term and pre-
serve supersymmetry. presumably this follows in a straightforward way from the
component analysis indicated above. on the other hand, the dimensional reduction
of this 6-dimensional theory to 4 dimensions (and below) permits a supersymmet-
ric potential energy termthe bosonic potential energy v is the norm square of a
vector eld on x which preserves the hyperkahler structure.

chapter 3. supersymmetric -models

3.5. superspace construction
consider a superspace m n|s in any dimension built out of any real spin represen-
tation, and let x be any riemannian manifold. introduce a scalar supereld

(3.94)

 : m n|s  x.

let i : m n  m n|s be the inclusion. there are component elds

(3.95)

 = i
a = ida

of the type we need, but in general higher derivatives of  lead to more components.

it is tempting to write a lagrangian

(3.96)

l = l |dnx|

of the form l = is for some function s on superspace. we need 4 fermionic
derivatives in superspace to have 2 spacetime derivatives on the scalar , and the
natural invariant expression is

(3.97)

l = inkg ac bddadbhdc, ddio,

where k is a constant. in fact, the term

(3.98)

l = inkg ac bdhdadc, dbddio

contains a multiple of the bosonic lagrangian (3.15), and this xes the constant k.
it is not hard to see that we also obtain the kinetic term for the fermion . in
additionif there are at least 2 supersymmetrieswe nd terms with no derivatives
built out of auxiliary elds, which are restrictions to m n of second derivatives
of . but in general this construction fails to give a supersymmetric lagrangian:
there are too many component elds. we can eliminate some of them from the
supersymmetry transformation laws derived from (1.29), but there is no guarantee
that (3.97) is supersymmetric, nor that the supersymmetry algebra closes on-shell.
in fact, this construction does work for s = 1 supersymmetry (1.52) and s =
2 supersymmetries (4). for s = 1 there are no auxiliary elds; for s = 2 there is
an auxiliary real scalar eld. for s = 4 supersymmetries (5) the superspace model
presented here works if we impose a constraint on  which eliminates many of the
component elds. there is then a single auxiliary complex scalar eld. in all of
these cases we express (3.97) in a form which is manifestly supersymmetric.

3.6. dimensional reduction
in a standard way we can reduce a theory on m n to a theory on m m for m < n by
considering elds on m n invariant under an (n  m)-dimensional space of spatial
translations. the scalar eld  reduces to a scalar eld on m m, and the spinor
eld  reduces to (nonchiral) spinor elds on m m. (a single spinor eld on m n gives
possibly many spinor elds on m m. for example, the 8-component chiral spinor
eld in the 6-dimensional f = h model reduces to 4 right handed and 4 left handed

52

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

spinor elds in m 2.) the reduced model has the same number of supersymmetries
as the original.

in particular, we can relate the three supersymmetric -models considered here.
for example, the dimensional reduction of the linear f = c model to 3 dimensions
gives two copies of the f = r model. similarly, the dimensional reduction of
the nonlinear f = c model with target a kahler manifold x gives the nonlinear
f = r model with target the underlying real manifold. in this case the fermion  of
the 3-dimensional model is dened in terms of the fermion  of the 4-dimensional
model by

(3.99)

 =

 + 
2

.

then the lagrangian (3.48) reduces to twice the lagrangian (3.47). for example,
if we plug (3.99) into the curvature term in (3.47) we have 6 nonzero terms with
a factor of 1/48 in front, and twice 6  1/48 is 1/4. the sign also works. the
dimensional reduction of the potential term (3.85) in the f = c model gives the
potential term (3.83) with

(3.100)

h = re w.

to dimensionally reduce the f = h model to 4 dimensions, we must x a
kahler structure on the hyperkahler target manifold x.
in fact, there is a 2-
sphere of such kahler structures parametrized by the unit imaginary quaternions
acting on the vector space w  (cf. (3.51)). we choose the basis {e1, e2} of w so
that v  c e1 is the bundle of type (1, 0) tangent vectors to x and v  c e2 the
bundle of type (0, 1) tangent vectors to x. as for the spinor elds, recall from 2.2
that under dimensional reduction we identify s0 = s  s, where s  s is
the complexied spinor representation of spin(1, 3). thus the spinor elds of the
dimensionally reduced theory transform in (s  s)  v . in indices, if i is a
complex tangent vector to x, then we dene

(3.101)

  = 2.

note  is real if   is the complex conjugate of . if 
we dene a spinor eld  on m 4 by

(3.102)

1 =

2 =

1 = j 
 
2 = j 




3 ,

4 ,

where j is the pseudoreal structure on v . the reality condition on  is that  
a is
the complex conjugate of 
a . armed with these formulas, together with (2.99)
and (3.55), we dimensionally reduce (3.49) to m 4,
i.e., we evaluate (3.49) on
elds ,  which satisfy 12 = 12 = 0. a bit of computation shows that we
recover (3.48).

chapter 4
the supersymmetric -model in dimension 3

in this section we discuss the -model with 2 supersymmetries. we already
described it in components in chapter 3. here we give a manifestly supersymmet-
ric treatment in superspace. we begin in 4.1 by deriving the component elds
and supersymmetry transformation laws, following the general principles laid out
in 1.2. then in 4.2 we state the superspace lagrangian and derive the component
lagrangian. we recover the lagrangian of theorem 3.46(i) except with the addition
of an auxiliary eld. one virtue of the auxiliary eld is that now the bracketing
relations among the supersymmetry transformations (4.14) are precisely those of
the super poincare algebra; without the auxiliary eld we need to impose the equa-
tions of motion to get the correct algebra. in 4.3 we prove theorem 3.82(i), which
describes the supersymmetric potential term. we carry out the analysis of the
classical theory in 4.4we compute the variational 1-form, equations of motion,
symplectic structure, supercurrentdirectly in superspace and from that rederive
the component expressions obtained in chapter 3. we conclude in 4.5 by briey
considering the dimensional reduction to 2 dimensions, where the poisson brackets
of the supercharges leads to a central extension of the super poincare algebra.

4.1. fields and supersymmetry transformations on m 3|2

linear case. we begin with a real scalar supereld

(4.1)

dene the component elds as

(4.2)

 : m 3|2  r.

 = i
a = ida
f = i(d2).

so  is a real function on minkowski space m 3, the eld  = af a is a spinor eld
on m 3, and f is again a real function on m 3. note that  and f are even whereas
 is odd . we will see that the eld f only enters algebraically, and its equations
of motion are algebraic. such a eld is termed auxiliary since we can solve for
it algebraically in terms of the other elds. the collection of component elds is
termed a multiplet , so here (, , f ) is a real scalar multiplet.

53

54

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

let  be the vector eld on the space f(,,f ) of component elds induced by the
supersymmetry transformation aqa, where a are odd parameters. we compute
the action of  on component elds using (1.29). for the lowest component  this
is straightforward:

(4.3)

 = aida = aa.

for the action on a we use (2.42):

(4.4)

a = bidbda

= bi(ab  bad2)
= bab  abbf.

to compute the action on f we use (2.43):

(4.5)

f = aida(d2)
= abciabdc
= abcabc
= a(d/)a.

the reader should check the supersymmetry algebra (1.30) and should also com-
pare (4.3) and (4.4) to (3.23).

nonlinear case. for the nonlinear -model into a riemannian manifold x the
supereld is a map

(4.6)

 : m 3|2  x.

the components are dened by the (covariant) extensions of (4.2) using the levi-
civita covariant derivative:

(4.7)

 = i
a = ida
f = i(d2).

now  : m 3  x is a map into the target manifold, i.e., the eld of the underlying
bosonic -model. then  = af a is a spinor eld on m 3 with values in t x,
i.e.,  : m 3  s  t x. (recall that  denotes parity reversal.) for ped-
agogical purposes we use the symbol da to denote the covariant derivative of a
section of t x in the direction da and ab for the covariant derivative in the
direction ab. then d2 = 1
2 abdadb, and f is a scalar with values in t x, i.e., a
section of t x on m 3.

to compute with the nonlinear supereld  it is useful to recall that

(4.8)

dadb = dbda,

chapter 4. the supersymmetric -model in dimension 3

55

since the levi-civita connection is torsionfree. also,

(4.9)

r(da, db) = dadb + dbda + 2ab

on t x

by the denition of the curvature r of t x and the sign rule. one must also be
careful with the sign rule when applying the bianchi identity.

now the analogs of equations (2.43) for covariant derivatives are easily derived:

(4.10)

(4.11)

dad2 = bc(cid:0)ab 
d2da = bc(cid:0)ab 

1
3
1
6

r(da, db)(cid:1)dc,
r(da, db)(cid:1)dc.

to illustrate the computations, we derive (4.11) for a = 1:

(4.12)

2d2d1 = d1d2d1  d2d1d1

=(cid:2)r(d1, d2)d1  d2d1d1  212d1(cid:3) + d211
= 2d211  212d1 + r(d1, d2)d1
= 211d2  212d1 + r(d1, d2)d1.

at the last stage, and also when we compare (4.12) with (4.11), we use the bianchi
identity r(d1, d1)d2 = 2r(d1, d2)d1.
for the elds in the nonlinear case. in fact, the only change comes in (4.5):

using (4.10) and (4.11) it is a routine matter to derive the transformation laws

(4.13)

f = aida(d2)
= abci(cid:0)ab

r(da, db)(cid:1)dc

for convenience we collect the transformation formulas for the component

elds:

(4.14)

 = aa
a = b(ab  abf )
f = a(cid:2)(d/)a +

bcr(a, b)c(cid:3).

these formulas have easy reductions to m 2|2. as mentioned after (2.106) we

simply set 12 = 12 = 0 and relabel indices as 1=+ and 2=:

f = ++ + +  +r(+, )+ + r(, +).

4.2. the -model action on m 3|2

since the computations in the nonlinear case are no more dicult than in the linear
case, we proceed directly to it. so our supereld (4.6) is a map  : m 3|2  x into
a riemannian manifold x. the lagrangian density on m 3|2 is

(4.16)

l0 = |d3x| d2

abhda, dbi,

where h,i is the metric on x pulled back to a metric on t x. our goal is
to derive the component lagrangian as dened in (1.33). recall that in this case
we use integration over the  variables, expressed as dierentiation in (2.40). the
resulting lagrangian function on minkowski space is

(4.17)

l0 =z d2

4

abhda, dbi.

we carry out the integration using (2.40), at intermediate stages using (4.11)
and the covariant analog of (2.42), and nally using the denition of the component

it is nonnegative, as we expect in general for a supersymmetric lagrangian. the
bilinear form in  is a mass term for the fermions, which we abbreviate as

(4.25)

(hess h)(, ).

a vacuum solution of a classical eld theory on minkowski space is a eld
conguration with all fermions set to zero and all scalar elds set to constants
which minimize the energy. (if there are gauge elds, then they are chosen to be
trivial.) for l0 + l1 this means that   0 and  is a constant which is a critical
point of (4.24). now

(4.26)

dv = hgrad h, grad hi.

this certainly vanishes at critical points of h. at such points the potential en-
ergy vanishes and supersymmetry is unbroken. this means that the solution is
annihilated by the supersymmetry transformation (4.14). for any vacuum solution
(4.14) simplies to (using (4.22))

(4.27)

a = bab grad h,

and clearly  = 0 only at a critical point of h. thus at critical points of v which
are not critical points of h, supersymmetry is broken. at such a point grad h is in
the kernel of the mass form (4.25) for the fermions. in other words, at such a point
there is a massless fermion, the so-called goldstone fermion.

4.4. analysis of the classical theory
we rst compute the variation of the lagrangian density l0 + l1 under an arbitrary
even variation  of the supereld . one should interpret l0 + l1 as living
on f  m 3|2, where f is the supermanifold of superelds . then  is the
component of the dierential along f. we have

solutions m  f; the global symplectic 2-form on m is obtained by integrating 
over a spacelike hypersurface of codimension 1|0 in m 3|2.
this completes the analysis in superspace. now we expand in components.
we begin with the equation of motion (4.31). restricting to minkowski space, we

simply recover the equation of motion (4.22) for f . the equation of motion for

setting the fermion  = 0, is

4.5. reduction to m 2|(1,1)

we can reduce the model to n = 2 dimensions either in superspace or in components.
in both cases we consider the n = 3 dimensional theory with elds constrained to
be invariant under 12. all the formulas worked out in n = 3 dimensions hold,
but there are simplications. we already wrote in (4.15) the supersymmetry trans-
formations. we record here the supercharges q+, q obtained by integrating the
noether current (4.54) over space:

(4.57)

q+ =zx0=constnh+, +i  h grad h, io |dx1|
q =zx0=constnh, i + h grad h, +io |dx1|.

in the abstract supersymmetry algebra (1.15) the lie bracket [q+, q] of the
supersymmetry generators vanishes. however, the poisson bracket { q+, q} of
the noether charges is nonzero in this case; it is a locally constant function on the
space of classical solutions. we compute it by acting bq+ on q, where bq+ is the

hamiltonian vector eld which corresponds to the function q+; its action on elds
is given in (4.15):

(4.58)

bq+ = +
bq++ = +
bq+ =  grad h

bq+( grad h) = + + r(+, )+.

in the following computation most terms drop out after we use the equation of
motion (4.34) and the bianchi identity:

(4.59)

2 { q+, q} =

2zx0=constnh,  grad hi + h+,  grad hio |dx1|
=zx0=consth1,  grad hi |dx1|
=zx0=const
1(h) |dx1|
= h(cid:0)()(cid:1)  h(cid:0)()(cid:1).

a scalar eld  = (x1) depending on the spatial variable has nite energy only if
it has limits as x1   which are critical points of h. the poisson bracket (4.59)
measures the dierence of the critical values. it induces a central extension of the
abstract supersymmetry algebra.

chapter 5
the supersymmetric -model in dimension 4

in this chapter we consider the -model with 4 supersymmetries, which was
described in components in chapter 3. here we give a manifestly supersymmetric
treatment in superspace. in many respects the treatment parallels that of chap-
ter 4, so we are briefer here. (one new feature over theories with 2 supersymmetries
is the presence of an r-symmetry.) although the model is well-dened and super-
symmetric for any kahler target manifold x, the superspace model is nicest when
x is hodge. in that case we give a global superspace lagrangian (see (5.22)). in
these theories the scalar potential is the norm square of the gradient of a holomor-
phic function called the superpotential . we describe it in 5.3, and in particular
prove theorem 3.82(ii). we do not give a detailed analysis of the classical theory,
but simply summarize the most important equations in 5.4.

where x is a complex manifold and  is required to pullback holomorphic functions
on x to linear chiral superelds on m 4|4. another way to state this is that da is
a vector eld of type (1, 0), and so d a is a vector eld of type (0, 1). again the
composition of a chiral supereld and a holomorphic function is a chiral supereld.
the conjugate conditions dene a nonlinear antichiral supereld. to dene the
component elds we assume that x is kahler31 and use the levi-civita covariant

nonlinear case. now we carry out the same computation for the nonlinear chiral
supereld (5.6) with values in a kahler manifold x. the supereld expression for
the lagrangian depends on the choice of a local kahler potential k, which is a
locally dened real-valued function on x such that the kahler form is

(5.15)

and the metric is

(5.16)

 = 1  k

h,i = 21  = 2 k,

viewed as a bilinear form on t x  t x. for example, on c we have a global kahler
potential k(z, z) = 1
2kzk2. we use double bar notation k  k throughout for the
norm on a hermitian vector space.

the lagrangian density on m 4|4 is

(5.17)

l0 = |d4x| d4

1
2

k(, ).

although it depends on a choice of kahler potential, the component lagrangian
makes sense globally by the following argument. consider a change k  k +
f + f for f a holomorphic function on x. of course, it does not aect the kahler
form (5.15) and is exactly the ambiguity in the choice of kahler potential. now since
we compute the component lagrangian using the rst term of (2.71)the integral
over  plus the wave operatorand since that operation annihilates chiral and
antichiral superelds, such a change in k does not aect the component lagrangian.
there is a global formulation of the lagrangian density l0 on superspace when
x is a hodge manifold. a hodge manifold is a kahler manifold x together with
a holomorphic hermitian line bundle l  x whose curvature is related to the
kahler form by

(5.18)

curv(l) = 1 .

recall that if s is a local holomorphic section of l  x, then
(5.19)

curv(l) =  log ksk2,

and so log ksk2 is a local kahler potential. consider a chiral supereld  : m 4|4 
x. since minkowski space is contractible, there is a global lift to a chiral supereld32

(5.21)

 : m 4|4  l

which is a section of l  m 4|4. for any such lift we write the lagrangian (5.17)
globally as

(5.22)

l0 = |d4x| d4

1
2

log k k2.

32the existence of a global lift depends on the fact that

(5.20)

h 1(m 4|4, c) = 0,

where c is the sheaf of nonzero chiral superelds. the vanishing (5.20) is obvious in components.

68

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

by the argument in the previous paragraph the corresponding component lagrangian
is independent of the choice of lift . we remark that it is not unfamiliar to have
an action whose lagrangian density depends on an auxiliary map: consider, for
example, the usual formulation of the wess-zumino-witten term in two or four
dimensions.

as a preliminary to computing the component lagrangian from (5.17), note
that the cartan formula lie() = d() + ()d for the lie derivative, valid for all
vector elds , implies the following equations when acting on 1-forms:

(5.23)

(5.24)

()()d =  lie()()  lie()() + ([, ]),
()()d = lie()()  lie()() + ([, ]),

,  odd;
 odd,  even.

we use these formulas several times in the next computation.

now we add (5.28) to its complex conjugate. since

the left hand side restricted to m 4 is the component lagrangian (as in the second

recall that we have absorbed an exact term (5.14) in writing the dirac form.
with this understood, the lagrangian (5.30) agrees with (3.48) after eliminating
the auxiliary eld.

we check in problem fp10(c) of [i-homework] that the lagrangian (5.17)

on m 4|4 reduces to (4.16) in m 3|2.

a new aspect in four dimensions is the u (1) r-symmetry (2.81). we claim
that the -model lagrangian is invariant under r. first, in the superspace expres-
sion (5.17) (or (5.22)) we note that d4 = d2 d2  is invariant. so if r acts trivially
on , then l0 is obviously invariant. when r acts nontrivially it is easier to argue
in components. suppose for simplicity that  takes values in c, and let r acts
on  with weight k. then

(5.31)

r = k,

r = (k + 1),

rf = (k + 1)f,

r  = k 
r  = (k + 1) 
rf = (k + 2)f .

sense as a density on minkowski space. similarly, for  antichiral we can de-

direct inspection of (5.30) shows that l0 is r-invariant.
5.3. the superpotential term on m 4|4
as a preliminary, note that if  is any chiral supereld, then |d4x|r d2  makes
ne |d4x|r d2  . one view is that m 4|4 is a split cs-manifold with a complex
two dimensional odd tangent bundle. in fact, there are two such cs-manifolds, one
for each of the complex structures on the real four dimensional spin representa-
tion (see (2.2)). these cs-manifolds have canonical densitiesdenoted |d4x| d2
(resp. |d4x| d2 )and global functions on these cs-manifolds are chiral (resp. an-
tichiral) superelds. to compute these chiral integrals we use (2.40).
the distinction between terms in the action of the formr |d4x| d4 andr |d4x| d2

is important in m 4|4 and also in m 2|(2,2).

70

we introduce a superpotential term, and we may as well work in the nonlinear

-model. let w : x  c be a holomorphic function, and set
(5.32)

l1 = |d4x| rend2 (w )o.

it lives in the direct sum of the spaces of chiral and antichiral densities. the
superpotential term in the component action is the integral of l1:
(5.33)

2(cid:26)z d2 (w ) + z d2  (w )(cid:27) =z |d4x| l1.

z l1 =z |d4x|

we compute l1 exactly as in (4.21); recalling our normalizations (5.7) for the
component elds we obtain

 abw (  a, b).
(5.34) l1 = (f )w +(f )w
we eliminate the auxiliary elds f, f from l0 + l1 using their equations of motion

(5.35)

f =  grad w
f = grad w ,

where now grad w is the vector eld of type (0, 1) corresponding to the (1, 0)-
form w using the hermitian metric on x. the total lagrangian with auxiliary
elds eliminated is then

this is the lagrangian (3.85), and since the superspace model is manifestly su-
persymmetric we have proved theorem 3.82(ii). of course, the potential energy
in (5.36) is

(5.37)

v = k grad wk2.

other aspects of the discussion following (4.23) carry over directly.

finally, we consider the r-symmetry (2.81). we already noted that it leaves l0
and l0 invariant, even if  is assigned a nonzero weight. on the other hand, d2 has
weight 2 and so if l1 is to be invariant we must be able to assign  a weight so that
(w ) has weight 2. (in general, there are several i with dierent weights.)
such a w is termed quasi-homogeneous in the physics literature.

supersymmetric yang-mills theories

now we consider theories with gauge elds (connections). in the bosonic case
there is a yang-mills theory in any dimension. the supersymmetric extension in-
volves a dual spinor eld as well, and it exists in dimensions n = 3, 4, 6, 10 with
minimal supersymmetry. our treatment in 6.1 is based on a special property of
spinors which holds only in these cases: the quadratic form s 7 (s, s) on s
takes values on the light cone. in 6.2 we describe the supersymmetric extensions
of the most general bosonic theory, which is variously called a gauge theory with
matter or a gauged -model . we consider theories in dimensions n = 3, 4, 6 with
minimal supersymmetry. (the only theory in n = 10 is pure yang-mills.) the basic
lagrangians, supersymmetry transformations, and supercurrents are summarized in
theorem 6.33. there are new terms which appear neither in the pure -model
nor in the pure yang-mills theory. there is a superspace formulation of supersym-
metric gauge theories in dimensions n = 3, 4, 6 (with minimal supersymmetry); we
describe some common features in 6.3. the condition on the quadratic form has
a geometric signicance here as well. details of the superspace formulation occupy
the remaining chapters.

we ask: when is (6.3) supersymmetric? that is, in which dimensions and for what
type of spinor eld  is (6.3) supersymmetric? consider rst the abelian theory,
which is free. suppose the spinor eld has s components. upon quantization,33
the gauge eld a has n  2 physical degrees of freedom and the spinor eld has
s/2 physical degrees of freedom. with one exception (explained presently) the
number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in a supersymmetric theory
must be equal, from which n = 2 + s/2. this is satised only for n = 3, 4, 6, 10 with
minimal supersymmetry s = 2, 4, 8, 16.

theorem 6.4. the super yang-mills lagrangian (6.3) is supersymmetric in n =
3, 4, 6, 10 dimensions with minimal supersymmetry.

there is an additional supersymmetric theorythe exception referred to above
in n = 2 dimensions with s = (1, 0) supersymmetry; we will not consider it. the
quantum argument above shows that (6.3) cannot be supersymmetric in other di-
mensions and with other amounts of supersymmetry.

proof. we work in n-dimensional minkowski space and x a real spin representa-
tion s. thus we have pairings (1.1), (1.2) which satisfy the cliord relation (1.3).
the spinor eld  takes values in s  ad p . the lagrangian (6.3) is

each side of the rst equation is a component of a 1-form with values in the adjoint
bundle. these equations are motivated by lorentz invariance, gauge invariance,
parity, and power counting.

there are two things we need to check: (i)  is a (nonmanifest) symmetry of l;
and (ii) the lie bracket of transformations (6.8) is consistent with (1.30). we will
nd the conditions under which (i) and (ii) hold.

33the free quantum theory is only used here to rule out some cases; otherwise the argument is
entirely classical.

when acting on the spinor eld f = , we replace  with the covariant deriv-

horizontal lift, and it is easy to compute that the action of  on a has th com-
ponent equal to f.

here we use the equation of motion (6.17) to see that the last term in the rst line
vanishes when  and  are exchanged. if the second term vanishes, then this is the
desired bracket. hence the supersymmetry algebra is satised on-shell if and only
if the quartic form (6.14) vanishes. this applies both to the abelian and nonabelian
theories.

this completes the proof that (6.3) is supersymmetric.

orthogonal vector space and g acts linearly by an orthogonal representation  : g 
o(x). then

(6.59)

where  : g  o(x) is the innitesimal action. this term can be predicted by
supersymmetry: the variation in a of hd/ai is canceled by the variation in  of
this term. for f = c note that a is a vector eld of type (1, 0) on x, so only the
(0, 1)-component of a
 and its conjugate enter (6.42). in the linear case g acts by
a unitary representation  : g  u (x) on a hermitian vector space x. then the
(1, 0)-component of  is

(6.60)

()1,0 = c(),

where c : gc  glc(x) is the complexication of the dierential to . to write
a formula for the (0, 1)-component we identify x = x  via the hermitian metric;
then

()0,1 =  c()  x  = x

(6.61)
at the point   x . (as a real manifold, x  = x = x so we can identify points
of x with points of x .) note that when  is real, then c() is skew-hermitian
and (6.61) is the complex conjugate of (6.60), i.e.,  is real. also,36

which also holds in the nonlinear case. this ensures that (6.42) is real.

the quotient in (6.45) is the symplectic (kahler) quotient, which can often
be identied with the complex quotient of crit(w ) by the complexication of g.
the quotient in (6.51) is the hyperkahler quotient. (it was in this context that the
of
innitesimal characters acts by translations on the space of moment maps. theories
with dierent choices of moment map are dierent. notice that when x is a point
we must still choose a moment map, which is now simply an innitesimal character.

hyperkahler quotient was discovered.) for f = c the abelian group (cid:0)g/[g, g](cid:1)

the resulting term (cid:0)2||2(cid:1) is usually called a fayet-iliopoulos term. for f = h
the moment map is also ambiguous, this time up to (cid:0)g/[g, g](cid:1)
 im h. for x a
the action of r-symmetries for f = c and f = h is summarized in (5.31),

point this leads to a fayet-iliopoulos term.

(8.24), and (10.21).

we have not written the equations of motion for these general lagrangians; it
seems better to work out the detailed form on a case-by-case basis. however, we
indicate here some general features. for the scalar eld  we nd an equation of
the form

(6.63)

(cid:3)a =  grad v + q(2)

 (, ) + r(2)

 ()d + q(4)().

36we caution the reader that  denotes the conjugate in the lie algebra. for example,
g = t is the circle group, then g = 1 r and gc = c with conjugation minus the usual complex

conjugation in c. see problem ash4 of [i-homework] for a sample lagrangian in this case.

ada is the wave operator on sections of x p  m n. the coecients
here (cid:3)a = d
of the quadratic form q(2)
 depend on the pullback of the hessian of h or w (for
f = r or f = c) and also on the action of g on x; the coecients of the qua-
dratic form r(2)
 depend on the pullback of the riemann curvature tensor; and the
coecients of the quartic form q(4)
 depend on the pullback of derivatives of the
riemann curvature tensor. now the action of g on x induces a map from g to
vertical vector elds on x p , or equivalently a g-valued vector eld  on x p . this
vector eld enters into some equations of motion, for example in the equation

(6.64)

d/a = h, i.
here  means the pullback of  by the section .

6.3. superspace construction
we consider only pure gauge theory. as usual we x data (6.1). consider a su-
perspace m n|s in any dimension built out of any real spin representation. suppose
p  m n|s is a principal g bundle. let a be a connection on p. if a is uncon-
strained, then there are too many component elds to obtain a sensible theory,
even with n, s small. hence we impose a constraint. namely, we require that the
curvature fa be constrained to vanish along the left-invariant odd distribution 
on m n|s:

(6.65)

(db)(da)fa = 0.

in that case the lowest piece of the curvature is in the even-odd direction. let
da be the horizontal lift of da and  the horizontal lift of . dene

(6.66)

a =

1
n

ab(db)()fa =

1
n

ab[db,].

(the constant is chosen with hindsight.) also, we identify g-invariant vertical
vector elds with sections of the adjoint bundle; see [i-classical fields, 4.2].)
this is a projection of the lowest nonvanishing part of the curvature; a is an
odd section of the adjoint bundle ad p = p g g  m n|s. there are component
elds

(6.67)

a = ia
a = ia

connection on p = ip  m n
dual spinor eld on m n with values in ad p

and possibly additional component elds as well. to see what other component
elds there are, we examine consequences of the bianchi identity.

first, we apply bianchi to da, db, dc to learn that

(6.68)

the symmetrization of 

ab[dc,] in a, b, c vanishes.

to interpret this, consider the sequence of maps

the composition vanishes if and only if for all s in s, (s, s)  s maps to 0
in s, i.e., if and only if for all t  s,
(6.70)

himage of (s, s)  s, ti = h(s, s), (s, t)i

vanishes. the last expression is obtained by polarization fromh(s, s), (s, s)i,
and the composition vanishes if and only if the quadratic form (6.14) does. as
we have seen, this occurs for n = dim v = 3, 4, 6, 10 with minimal supersymmetry
s = dim s = 2, 4, 8, 16. furthermore, in these cases the sequence (6.69) is exact.
assume from now on that we are in one of these situations. now the dual to (6.69)
is

(6.71)

s  v   s  sym3(s).

the even-odd piece of the curvature can be identied with an element of
0(m n|s, adp)  v   s;then (6.68) asserts that its image in 0(m n|s, adp) 
sym3(s) vanishes. by the exactness of (6.71) we can then identify the even-odd
piece of the curvature with an element   0(m n|s, adp)s, as dened in (6.66).
in fact, the cliord identity implies that

is a splitting of (6.71), whence the formula (6.66) for . to summarize, in the four
cases we are considering the even-odd curvature can be expressed in terms of :

(6.73)

[da,] = g

abb.

next, we apply bianchi to da, db, . after some manipulation with (6.73)

and the cliord identity we nd

cbf = g ac

bddcd + ndba,

where the even-even part of the curvature is

(6.75)

f = ( )()fa = [, ].

(the funny sign is due to the fact that we take the bracket as vector elds on p ,
not as operators on an associated bundle; cf. [i-classical fields, 4.2].) the rst
term on the right hand side of (6.74) depends on the particular case, and its precise
form determines the structure of the auxiliary elds. in n = 3, 4, 6 dimensions we
will nd a formula of the form

(6.76)

dba =

ac

cbf + e,

where ie consists of auxiliary elds. (compare with the second equation in (6.8).)
we do not learn anything new from the remaining cases of the bianchi identity.

is the curvature of a.

from the general formula (1.29) and equations (6.73) and (6.76) we recover
the supersymmetry transformation law (6.8), at least if we set e = 0. for exam-
ple, to compute the action of  on the connection a, we lift the vector eld ada
on m n|s to the horizontal vector eld ada on p and apply the covariant deriv-
ative. from (6.73) the th component of the answer is

which agrees with (6.8). the precise formula for the variation of the fermion ,
which includes the auxiliary elds, must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

in 7, 8, and 10 we construct the superspace models for the cases n = 3, 4,
and 6 (previously referred to as f = r, c, and h). supersymmetry is manifest in
the superspace formulation, and we determine the auxiliary elds by computing e
in (6.76). in addition, for n = 3, 4 we give a superspace formulation of the gauge
theory coupled to matter, and so prove theorem 6.33(i) and theorem 6.33(ii).
there is no known superspace formulation for the n = 10 dimensional theory.

there are also superspace models for dimensional reductions of the n = 3, 4, 6
theories; particular cases are treated in 9 and 10. we remark here that (6.65) is
no longer the correct curvature constraint in superspace; some components of the
odd-odd curvature are allowed to be nonzero.

chapter 7
n = 1 yang-mills theory in dimension 3

for the scalar supereld of chapter 4 and the chiral supereld of chapter 5
it is easy to see that the supermanifold of superelds is dieomorphic to the su-
permanifold of component elds. but for constrained connections the argument is
more complicated due to gauge symmetry. the precise statement is the main task
of 7.1. in 7.2 and 7.3 we describe the superspace formulation of the yang-mills
lagrangian and of the lagrangian including matter. there are no surprises, though
we do explain where the new term in the component lagrangian (6.36) (coupling
the two sorts of spinors) arises from the superspace point of view.

7.1. constrained connections on m 3|2
we specialize the discussion in 6.3 to m 3|2. our rst task is to evaluate (6.74).
to that end we compute using the formulas of 2.3:

g ac

bd = gaa

(7.1)

(abcd + adcb)(aa

plugging into (6.74) we obtain

(7.2)

2ac
setting a = b and summing we nd

cbf = 4dba + a

bdcc.

(7.3)

6dcc = 2aa

cc


ac

acf = 0,

since  and f are skew-symmetric. thus (7.2) becomes

(7.4)

dba = 

1

ac

cbf.

this implies e = 0 in (6.76), which means that there are no auxiliary elds.
the multiplet {a, } of component elds is called the vector multiplet , and
from the vector multiplet we can reconstruct the constrained connection a. the
precise statement is the following.

85

86

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

proposition 7.5. the category of connections a on m 3|2 whose curvature van-
ishes on the odd distribution  is equivalent to the category of pairs {a, } consisting
of a connection a on m 3 and a dual spinor eld  with values in the adjoint bundle.

we rst comment on the meaning of proposition 7.5. as odd elds are involved,
it is crucial to work over a base s: for any supermanifold s, what proposition 7.5
claims is that the functor which attaches the component elds to a constrained
connection is an equivalence between the following categories: (a) g-torsors on
m 3|2  s provided with a relative connection a satisfying the curvature constraint;
(b) g-torsors on m 3  s provided with a relative connection a and an adjoint
bundle valued dual spinor eld . note that in (b) we have m 3  s, not the
reduced space of m 3|2  s. as usual, in the proof we will keep s silent.
if p is a g-torsor with a connection a on m 3|2 (i.e. on m 3|2  s), any auto-
morphism of (p,a) which induces the identity on the restriction p of p to m 3(i.e.
m 3  s) is the identity. because of this, (p,a) can be viewed as a structure on
p . concretely, once some choices have been made on m 3 (see the proof of propo-
sition 7.5 for an example), if (p,a) is a g-torsor with connection on m 3|2 with
restriction p to m 3, and if s is a trivialization of p , the connection gives rise
to a canonical extension of s to a trivialization of p. given s, then a becomes
a 1-form  with values in the lie algebra g obeying suitable constraints. what
proposition 7.5 claims is that the map from the space of those s to the space of
(a, ) (a a connection on p , and  a g-valued dual spinor eld) is bijective. in other
words, for p a g-torsor on m 3 the map from (a) the set of isomorphism classes of
g-torsors p on m 3|2, given with a constrained connection a and an isomorphism
p  p | m 3, to (b) the set of (a, ), is bijective. in (a), the objects considered
have no non-trivial isomorphisms. because of this, the question is local, and one
may assume that p is the trivial g-torsor.
proof. the data on p of a constrained connection amounts to that of a partial
connection in the direction of the odd distribution  : a g-invariant lift to p not of
all vector elds, but only of those in  . if da (resp. ab) is the horizontal lift of
da (resp. ab), the vanishing along  of f means that

(7.6)

ab = 

1
2

[da,db].

if only the da are given, the corresponding constrained connection is obtained by
dening ab by this formula.
the functor implicit in proposition 7.5 attaches to (p,): the restriction to
m 3 of p (denoted p ), that of [da,db], and that of [[da,db],dc]; respectively: a g-
torsor on m 3, a connection on it, and a section of the adjoint bundle with vanishing
symmetrization in a, b, c. (cf. (6.68)).

we now choose a coordinate system as in 2.3, giving rise to the basis d1, d2 of
 . we will use d1, d2 to dene a retraction q: m 3|2  m 3, and, for p a torsor with
connection on m 3|2, with restriction p to m 3, an isomorphism of torsors qp  p
(partial gauge xing).
we rst explain an analog, in classical dierential geometry of what we will
do. suppose n is of codimension 2 in a variety m , and that d1, d2 are vector
elds which, on n , span the normal bundle tm /tn . in a neighborhood of n , the
ow exp(td1) generates from n a codimension 1 subvariety m1, with a retraction

chapter 7. n = 1 yang-mills theory in dimension 3

87

q1: m  n constant on the ow lines. repeating the process with m1 and d2,
we obtain in a neighborhood of n a retraction q2: m  m1, constant on the ow
lines of d2:

2(p|m1) p.

if p is a torsor on m with connection, with restriction p to n , integrating the
connection on the ow lines of d1, we obtain an isomorphism 1: q
1p  p on m1.
doing the same with d2, we obtain 2: q
in our case of codimension 0|2, the situation is dierent in that (a) the vector
eld d1 does not integrate to a foliation with leaves r1|0: the obstruction is d2
1 mod
(b) on r0|1, a connection  does not need to be at: curvature obstruction
d1.
2
 .
it however remains true that for n  m 3|2 a subvariety and d an odd vector
eld transversal to n , the vector eld d, in fact just its restriction to n , generates
from n an embedding n  r0|1  m 3|2. a function f on m 3|2 vanishes on the
image m1 if and only if f and df vanish on n , and the retraction q1: m1  n is
such that for any function u on n , dq
1(u) = 0. if p is a torsor with connection
on m 3|2, with restriction p to n , we have on m1 a unique isomorphism of torsors
q
1p  p|m1 which is the identity on n and such that on n the liftings of d agree.
one should beware that if d is given as a vector eld on m 3|2, it does not need to
be tangent to m1. this tangency to m1 holds only on n .

we apply this twice, to m 3  m 3|2 and d1, then to m1 and d2, obtaining
q: m 3|2  m1  m 3 and : qp  p. the construction of  uses only the
connection in the directions of d1 and d2: for p a torsor with a connection along
 , we obtain : qp  p, and the data of  is equivalent to that of part of the
connection, viz. d1 on m 3 and d2 on m1. it remains to check that to complete this
partial data to that of a connection  along  amounts to giving [da,db] on m 3 (a
connection on p ) and [[da,db],dc] on m 3 (a section on m 3 of ad p with vanishing
symmetrization in a, b, c, i.e., the data of just [[d1,d1],d2] and [[d2,d2],d1]).
let us choose a local trivialization of p , hence of p. the connection along 
is given by a section a of   with values in the lie algebra, i.e., by a1 = hd1, ai
and a2 = hd2, ai. that the connection is partially given by : qp  p amounts
to a1 = 0 on m 3 and a2 = 0 on m1, i.e. to a1 = a2 = d1a2 = 0 on m 3.
for the simplicity of notations, let us assume that g is gl(n), i.e., that we are

considering a vector bundle. we have then

(7.7)

[d1,d1] = 211 + 2d1a1
[d1,d2] = 212 + d2a1
[d2,d2] = 222 + 2d2a1

on

on

m 3

m 3 ,

so the data of the rst order jet of a1 and a2 along m 3 amounts to the data of the
connection on p . the remaining freedom: the addition of 12b1 to a1 and 12b2
to a2 amounts to the data of [[di,dj],dk] on m 3. indeed, by ai 7 ai + 12bi,
[[d1,d1],d2] on m 3 is increased by 2b1 and [[d2,d2],d1] by 2b2.

88

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

it is easy in this case to reformulate a constrained connection in terms of an
unconstrained eld. namely, take the unconstrained eld to be a partial connection
on p along the odd distribution  . then if da is the horizontal lift of da, dene
the horizontal lift ab of ab to be
(7.6)

in other words, the constraint that the odd-odd components of the curvature vanish
uniquely determines the connection a from the restriction of a to  .
it is convenient to lower an index on the spinor eld and dene37

equation (6.73) specializes to

note that (7.3) is now

we note a useful consequence of (7.10):

it is convenient to set

which is symmetric in a, c. then

in these variables the component elds are

(7.14)

and from (7.3) and (7.10) we have

(7.15)

fab = idab = idba.

the supersymmetry transformation laws (6.8) specialize to

(7.16)

and (6.9) specializes to

(7.17)

( a)ab = c(ac b + bc a)

a = bfab

fab = c(cid:2)cab + ac(d/)b(cid:3).

37this goes against our general wish not to raise or lower a single index using a skew-symmetric
tensor, since there is a sign ambiguity. however, dening a facilitates comparison with the
physics literature.

7.2. the yang-mills action on m 3|2
assume that g is compact. fix a bi-invariant inner product h,i on g. for a

we compute the component lagrangian function l2 using (2.40):

(7.19)

= 2abcdhacd, bi  abcdhfda, fcbi.

in the last step we use (7.15), (7.11), and (7.14). so from (2.27), (2.28), and the
fact that |fa|2 = |fa|2 we conclude

2|fa|2 +

2hd/ai.

l2 =

this is the super yang-mills lagrangian (6.3). thus we do have a superspace for-
mulation of this lagrangian in 3 dimensions.

next, we begin the analysis of the superspace lagrangian directly in superspace.
this is a redundant exercise, since we already have the component expressions
in (6.22) and the equations which follow. but it is instructive to see how the
computation looks in superspace.

we compute the superspace equation of motion by varying the unconstrained
partial connection da. notice that a variation da is a g-invariant vertical vector
eld, so corresponds to a section aa of the adjoint bundle. from (7.8), (6.66),
and (7.6) we compute

(7.21)

a =

cdn[[da,dc],dd] + [[da, dc],dd]  2[ac, dd]o.

we use the invariance of h,i, (7.10), and (7.11) to nd

so the superspace equation of motion is

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

the exact term is d for the variational 1-form . we do not compute the
precise expression, since it is unwieldy and not useful. one interesting feature
emerges quickly, though. namely,  contains a term proportional to

(7.24)

abcd(dd) |d3x| d2 dchaa, bi,

and so as a dierential 1-form on the space of elds  is not linear over functions.
(in other words, aa is dierentiated.)

we extract from (7.23) the equations of motion in components. restrict-

(7.25)

d/a = 0.

this agrees with (6.25). to obtain the equation of motion for a, we either ap-
ply ide to (7.23) or specialize (6.23). in either case we obtain

(7.26)

cdadfbc = [a, b]

for all a, b.

this agrees with (6.23). finally, the supercurrent (6.27) specializes to

since we didnt compute the exact term in (7.22), we do not give a superspace
computation of the supercurrent.

7.3. gauge theory with matter on m 3|2

in this subsection we prove theorem 6.33(i). suppose we are given the data
in (6.35): a riemannian manifold x on which g acts by isometries and a g-
invariant function h : x  r. fix a g bundle p  m 3|2. then we can form the
associated bundle x p  m 3|2 whose typical ber is x. the superelds in the
theory are a constrained connection a on p and a section  of x p. we view  as
an equivariant map

(7.28)

 : p  x.

then the formulas in 4 make sense provided we interpret the vector elds da, ab
as the horizontal lifts to p of the indicated vector elds on m 3|2. for example,
the component elds are still dened by (4.7), but now a = ida where da acts
by the covariant derivative associated to a. also, in the denition of the auxiliary
eld f = 1
2 i(d2d1 d1d2) the outer covariant derivatives are constructed from
both a and the levi-civita connection on x.
the superspace lagrangian for the theory is l0 + l1 + l2, where the individual
terms are dened in (4.16), (4.20), and (7.18). the only possible changes to the
computation of the component lagrangian are additional curvature terms from the
connection a. recall that a is constrained to be at on the odd distribution  , and
this constraint eliminates many such possible terms. with this in mind we examine
the computation (4.18). there is a change in the formula (4.11) for d2db, which

chapter 7. n = 1 yang-mills theory in dimension 3

91

is used to pass from the second line of (4.18) to the third line. examining (4.12)
we see that there is a new term from the even-odd curvature of a in passing to the
last line. hence (4.11) is replaced by38

(7.29)

d2da = bc(cid:0)ab 

1
6

r(da,db)(cid:1)dc + 2(a),

where (a) is the vector eld on x p induced by the action of a on x. the new
term in (7.29) contributes an extra term to (4.18), and the new contribution to the
component lagrangian is

(7.30)

abha, (b)i = ha, a

i = ha

, ai.

the computation (4.21) with the potential term remains unchanged. altogether,
we nd the total component lagrangian to be (6.36), and this completes the proof
of theorem 6.33(i).

38recall a tricky sign in [i-classical fields, 4.2]: an equivariant vertical vector eld is identied
with a section of the adjoint bundle, and the action on a section of an associated bundle is by
minus the directional derivative.

chapter 8
n = 1 yang-mills theory in dimension 4

here we complete the discussion initiated in 6.3 of the supersymmetric for-
mulation of super yang-mills theory in dimension 4. this chapter parallels the
previous one. one new feature in 8.1 is the appearance of an auxiliary eld as well
as the existence of an r-symmetry. another new feature appears in 8.2, where the
coupling constant of the yang-mills lagrangian is complex. its imaginary part is
proportional to the usual coupling constant, whereas its real part is the coecient
of a chern-weil form. (if this term is present, then the theory is not invariant under
orientation-reversing symmetries.) in 8.3 we describe the superspace approach to
gauge theories with matter in case the target manifold of the scalar eld is hodge.
then there is a geometric explanation for the appearance of the moment map in
the component lagrangian (6.42).

8.1. constrained connections on m 4|4
we specialize the discussion in 6.3 to m 4|4. as explained in 2.4 we work in a
complex basis. our rst task is to evaluate (6.74). to that end we compute

thus there is an auxiliary eld in this theory. setting a = b and summing, the rst

equation (8.3) asserts that e is real:

(8.5)

e = e.

from (6.74) we also learn that

(8.6)
in other words, a is a chiral supereld.

d ba = 0;

let a, , e be the restrictions of a, , e to m 4. (it should cause no confusion
that the restriction of e to m 4 is also denoted e.) the multiplet {a, , e} of
component elds is called the vector multiplet , and from the vector multiplet we can
reconstruct the constrained connection a. the precise statement is the following.
proposition 8.7. the category of connections a on m 4|4 whose curvature van-
ishes on the odd distribution  is equivalent to the category of triples {a, , e}
consisting of a connection a on m 4, a dual real spinor eld  with values in the
adjoint bundle, and a section e of the adjoint bundle.

for an elucidation of what proposition 8.7 claims, we refer to the comments follow-
ing proposition 7.5. the following proof contains a description of an unconstrained
eld equivalent to a constrained connection.

proof. we rst consider the complex analog of proposition 8.7. for the complex
super minkowski space mc = m 4|4
c , instead of a complex structure on the distri-
bution  , we get a decomposition  =     , and the distributions   and   are
integrable. dividing by the corresponding foliations, we obtain

with   (resp  ) being the relative tangent bundle of mc/m  (resp mc/m ). let
mc  mc be the ordinary minkowski space, with images m  in m  and m  in m .
put m1 = (pr)1( m ) and m2 := (pr)1( m ). the projections pr and pr

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

if p is a g-torsor on mc, a constrained connection on p is determined by
its restriction to  and, arguing as in the proof of proposition 7.5, one sees that
constrained connections correspond one to one to connections in the direction of
 , which are integrable in the directions of   and  . an integrable connection in
the direction of   (resp  ) amounts to a way to descend p from mc to m  (resp
m ). a constrained connection hence amounts to the data of p  on m  and p  on
m  descending p:
(8.11)

p  (pr)1(p )

and

(8.12)

p  (pr)1(p ).

in the   (resp.  ) direction, the connection is given by (8.12) (resp. (8.11)).

let p be the restriction of p to mc, and let us choose a trivialization of p .
from (8.12) (resp (8.11)) we get a trivialization of p on m1 (resp m2): the only one
extending the given trivialization and compatible with the connection along   (resp
 ). from (8.9) (resp (8.10)) and (8.11) (resp (8.12)), we then get trivializations s
and s of p  and p .
we keep noting s and s their inverse images in p and let g : mc  g be the
map such that sg = s. the map g to g, trivial on m1 and m2, is an unconstrained
eld equivalent to the constrained connection. it can be written g = exp(u ), with u
a map to g = lie(g) vanishing on m1 and m2. in terms of g, the data (p,a) is the
trivial torsor, with the trivial connection in the direction of   and, in the direction
of  , the connection for which g is horizontal (given by the 1-form g1dg).
let us use coordinates as in 2.4. in those coordinates, m1 is dened by  b = 0,
and m2 by a = 0. let j be the ideal of functions vanishing on m1 and m2, and
i be the ideal generated by all  and . then, (j  i n)/j  i n+1 vanishes for
n 6= 2, 3, 4 and is spanned respectively by
b
n = 2 : the a 
n = 3 : the 12 
n = 4 : 12  1  2,

b and the a  1  2

the coecients being functions on mc. we have

(8.13)

da = da,
d a = da  g1dag.

it is then easy to check that u (mod i)3 gives the connection on p ; that changing
u by a section of (j  i 3)  g, taken modulo j  i 4, gives ; and changing u by a
section of (j  i 4)  g gives e.
we now consider the real case. the arguments used in the complex case work
in just the same way for the cs case, where super minkowski space is complexied
just in the odd direction. as explained in the comments after proposition 7.5,
we have to prove that some map is a bijection. this map is obtained from the

chapter 8. n = 1 yang-mills theory in dimension 4

95

similar map in the cs case by taking the xed points of complex conjugation, and
proposition 8.7 follows.

in the physics literature the eld u is referred to as the vector supereld in wess-
zumino gauge.

it is convenient to lower an index on the spinor eld and dene the chiral

the reality condition (8.5) (equivalently (8.3)) is

this has the useful consequence

(8.18)

d2wa = 2
it is convenient to write the curvature as

lie algebra gc is such that the real subalgebra is the lie algebra of the compact
group. thus for g = t the circle group the real subalgebra in gc = c is ir  c.

in these variables the component elds are

(8.20)

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

let  be the vector eld on the space of component elds corresponding to the
supersymmetry transformation aqa +  aq a. we compute it from the general
formula (1.29) and the other formulas in this section. we also can check the result
against (6.8) and (6.9) if we set the auxiliary eld e to zero. the result is:

(8.22)

fab =  c(cid:8)a cb + b ca(cid:9) + c(cid:8)ac(d/)b + bc(d/)a(cid:9).

under the r-symmetry (2.81) the component elds transform by (see (8.14)

and (8.16))

(8.24)

[r, aab] = 0
[r, a] = a
[r,  a] =  a
[r, e] = 0.

8.2. the yang-mills action on m 4|4
we assume g compact with h,i a bi-invariant inner product on g. extend h,i to
be a bilinear form on gc. fix   c. then for a constrained connection on m 4|4
the basic lagrangian density is

notice that the two terms in l2 are dened on dierent cs-manifolds. we compute
the contribution of the rst to the component lagrangian using (8.20) and (8.21):

the contribution of the second term in (8.25) is similar and we combine them
using (2.68). we x the standard orientation on m 4 to write the result in terms of
dierential forms:

this is essentially the super yang-mills lagrangian (6.3). we have written the
second term in complex notation and dropped an exact term along the way. note
e enters as an auxiliary eld; its equation of motion is e = 0. the last term is
topological ; the integral is a characteristic number (for connections of nite action).
note that the rst term makes sense as a density whereas to integrate the topological
term we need an orientation on m 4. another way to express (8.29) is to write
f = f + + f  in terms of its self-dual and anti-self-dual pieces (see (2.64)). then
the lagrangian function is

(8.30)

l2 = 


4|f +

the orientation on m 4 enters here in distinguishing self-dual from anti-self-dual.

we are following standard physics usage in our choice of constants. the closed
4-form hfa  fai represents a real characteristic class of p  m 4; if the bilinear
form h,i on g is such that the real characteristic class
162hfa  fai comes from
a class in h 4(bg; z), then  and  + 2 yield the same quantum theory.
next, we consider the action of the r-symmetry (2.81). now d2 has weight 2
under r and from (8.14) we see that wa has weight 1. it follows that (8.25) is
invariant under r. one can also use (8.24) to check that (8.29) is invariant under
the r-symmetry. we remark that even though the classical theory has a u (1) r-
symmetry, in the quantum theory this is broken to a nite subgroup by an anomaly
(which is computed using the index theorem).

8.3. gauge theory with matter on m 4|4

in this subsection we prove theorem 6.33(ii). suppose we are given the data
in (6.41), but with the additional proviso that x be hodge. this assumption
is only for exposition, as the computation we review is local and done for arbitrary
kahler manifolds. let l  x be the hodge line bundle, a hermitian line bundle
with curvature 1. in this theory a compact lie group g acts by isometries
on x, and we assume given a lift of the g action to l. this is roughly equivalent
to choosing a moment map

(8.33)

 : x  g

for the action of g on x, and in fact denes a moment map by the formula

(8.34)

() = 1 vert1(
),

  g.


here () is the function on x obtained by pairing (8.33) with ; the vector eld
on l is dened by the lifted action; and vert1 indicates the vertical part with
respect to the connection on l, taken at points of unit norm. it is easy to check
that  is a moment map. in other words

(8.35)

d() = (),

where  is the vector eld on x induced by the g action. in case x is kahler but
not hodge, we must choose a moment map. we also x a g-invariant holomorphic
function w : x  c.
fix a g bundle p  m 4|4. the superelds in the theory are a constrained
connection a on p and a chiral section  of the associated bundle x p , which we
view as an equivariant chiral map

(8.36)

 : p  x.

as in (5.21) there is a global lift to an equivariant chiral map

(8.37)

 : p  l.

then the total superspace lagrangian for the theory is l0 + l1 + l2, where the
individual terms are dened in (5.22), (5.32), and (8.25). we take the coupling
constants in the gauge theory to be g = 1 and  = 0. our task is to work out the
expansion in component elds. note that component elds are dened by (5.7),
though now the vector elds which enter the denitions are the da on pthe
horizontal lifts of the da dened by the connection a.
we re-examine the computation beginning in (5.25). since this uses the alter-
native form (5.17) of the lagrangian in terms of a local kahler potential k, which
we assume is g-invariant, our rst job is to express a moment map  in terms of k.
let  be the real vector eld on x which corresponds to   g. then an easy
computation from (8.35) shows

(8.38)

h, i = () = 1 1,0  k = 1 0,1  k

chapter 8. n = 1 yang-mills theory in dimension 4

99

denes a moment map, where  = 1,0 + 0,1 is expressed as a sum of its (1, 0) and
(0, 1) components and  : x  g is obtained from  using the inner product on g.
there are several new terms in (5.25)(5.27) from the nonzero bracket (8.15).
first, in the third line of (5.25) there is a new contribution from the bracket term
in (5.24):

(8.39)

ab c dd cn2([db,a d

= 4i1 (cid:0) e(cid:1)k + 2i c d(d c)(cid:0)(cw ) d(cid:1) k
= 4h , ei + 2  c dh  c, () di,

where (cw d) is the vector eld on x p induced by w d and similarly for e. in the
third line we use (5.23) and the fact that (d c)k is a g-invariant function on p,
so its derivative in the ber direction w d vanishes; in the fourth the denition (8.16)
of e and the fact that vertical vectors on p act with a minus sign (cf. the footnote
in 7.3); and in the fth (8.38) and (5.16), together with an extra minus sign due to
the odd variables.40 from (5.28) and (5.29) we see that the results of (5.25)(5.27)
enter the component lagrangian with a factor 1/4 and are added to their complex
conjugates. hence (8.39) leads to a contribution

(8.41)

2h , ei +

to the component lagrangian. also, in the second line of (5.27) there is a new term

(8.42)

ab c dn  da ([d c,b d

which by a similar computation contributes

(8.43)

as in 7.3 there is also a new term due to a revision of (5.9):

this enters the computation in (5.26), where we pick up

now substitute i = ii, where i are odd vectors and i are auxiliary odd parameters.

combining (8.41), (8.43), and (8.47) we obtain the total new contribution to the

(8.48)

2h , ei 

2(cid:16)cdh()c, di +  c dh  c, () di(cid:17)

the second term appears in (6.42), after using (8.14).

to recover the potential energy term in (6.42) we must eliminate the auxiliary

eld e. the terms involving e in (8.29) and (8.48) are:

(8.49)

the classical equation for e is then

(8.50)

e = 2  ,

and eliminating e we obtain the potential term

this completes the proof of theorem 6.33(ii). note the substitution (8.50) which
gives the last equation in (6.43) from the second equation in (8.22).

chapter 9
n = 2 yang-mills in dimension 2

the theory we study in this chapter is the reduction to two dimensions of the
basic four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory studied in 8. thus we begin
in 9.1 with some general remarks about dimensional reduction of ordinary bosonic
yang-mills. the crucial observation is that in the dimensionally reduced theory we
have not only a connection, but also some scalar elds and a nontrivial potential
energy. the dimensional reduction of a constrained connection on m 4|4, which is
described in 9.2, may be considered as a connection on m 2|4 with constraints.
but the constraints now allow some nonzero curvature along the odd distribution,
unlike the constraint condition in the maximal dimension 4. recall also that the
dimensionally reduced theory has a bigger r-symmetry group. in 9.3 we derive a
superspace expression for the yang-mills lagrangian.

9.1. dimensional reduction of bosonic yang-mills
consider pure yang-mills theory on minkowski space m n in n dimensions with
gauge group g. fix a bi-invariant inner product h,i on g. the eld is a connec-
tion a on a principal g bundle p  m n, and the lagrangian is
(9.1)

l = |dnx| 1

2 |fa|2.

let x0, x1, . . . , xn1 be standard coordinates on m n so that the metric is

(9.2)

g = (dx0)2  (dx1)2    (dxn1)2.

let t be the group of translations in the direction of the last k basis vectors. let
p be the quotient map p : m n  m n/t . the quotient m n/t is a minkowski space
of dimension n  k. if m nk  m n is dened by xnk =  = xn1 = 0, the
map p identies m nk with m n/t .
in the dimensional reduction of pure yang-mills theory, one considers: (a) a
principal g bundle p on m n/t = m nk, and (b) a t -invariant connection a on
its pullback to m n. let a be the restriction of a to m nk. being t -invariant, the
connection a can be written as

(9.3)

a = p(a) +

n1xnk

p(i)dxi,

101

102

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

the i being sections of the adjoint bundle.

the lagrangian density ln on m n for a is t -invariant. in the reduced theory,
the lagrangian density lnk on m nk is obtained by restricting ln to m nk and
contracting it against nk, . . . , n1: for  a lattice in t ,

(9.4)

z m nk lnk = vol(t /)1z m n/ ln.

the curvatures fa of a and fa of a are related by

(9.5)

fa = p(fa) + a(i)dxi +xi<j

[i, j] dxi  dxj,

the eld content of the reduced theory is a connection and k sections of the adjoint
bundle.

most relevant to us is the reduction to n  2 dimensions. thus consider a

connection a invariant by translations in the xn1, xn2 directions and write

(9.7)

a = a + 1dxn2 + 2dxn1.

a short computation gives for the reduced lagrangian

thus  is a section of the complexied adjoint bundle. therefore, the eld content
of the reduction of pure yang-mills by two dimensions is a connection and a complex
scalar eld in the adjoint representation. there is a nonzero potential energy term
for the scalar.

consider the reduction of the bosonic part of the 4-dimensional supersymmetric
yang-mills lagrangian (8.29) to 2 dimensions. the kinetic term for the connection
reduces as in (9.8). the auxiliary eld is a scalar, so the reduction is also a scalar.
the topological term reduces nontrivially, and the total reduced bosonic lagrangian

9.2. constrained connections on m 2|(2,2)
we use the notation established in (2.107)(2.119) for m 2|(2,2).

let p  m 4|4 be a principal bundle with structure group g. we suppose that
the vector elds 1 2, 2 1 on m 4|4 have been lifted to commuting complex conjugate
vector elds 1 2, 2 1 on p. let a be a constrained connection on p which is
invariant under these translations. all of the equations in 8.1 remain valid for a,
and we use them freely. the translation invariance is the equation
[ 1 2,da] = [ 2 1,da] = [ 1 2,d a] = [ 2 1,d a] = 0.

(9.11)

then the vertical vector eld

(9.12)

 =

(2 1  2 1)

is also translation invariant and corresponds to a section  of the complexied
adjoint bundle. it is the basic invariant of a translationally invariant constrained
connection. the bianchi identity relates  to the superelds considered in 8.1.
first, we consider bianchi for d2, d2, d 1 and d2, d 1, d 1 to deduce

(9.13)

d 1 = d2 = 0.

in other words, the restriction of  to m 2|(2,2) is twisted chiral. then bianchi
for d1, d 1, d 2 and bianchi for d2, d 1, d 2 imply

(9.14)

2w1 = d 1
2w2 = d 2.

using (9.14) and the results of 8.1 we can express the curvature fa completely in
terms of .
restrict the connection a and all derived superelds to m 2|(2,2)  m 4|4. let
i : m 2  m 2|(2,2) denote the inclusion, as usual. the component elds of the

the scalar eld  is a section of the complexied adjoint bundle; it is the same eld
which appears in the previous subsection. so too are fa, e sections of the adjoint
bundle, but both fa and e are real.

from the point of view of m 2|(2,2), we can think of a as a connection whose
curvature is constrained to vanish along the odd distribution except for the d2, d 1
direction (and its complex conjugate), where

(9.18)

[d2,d 1] = 22 .

there is an important distinction between the abelian and nonabelian cases.
in the abelian case the supereld  has values in the constant vector space g and
is unconstrained, except for the requirement that it be twisted chiral. up to gauge
equivalence the connection can be reconstructed from . in the nonabelian case, on
the other hand, the supereld  is a section of the adjoint bundle, and the twisted
chirality condition (9.13) depends on the connection a.

we can compute the transformation laws of the component elds under  =

directly, or by dimensional reduction from (8.22). the result is

from (9.12) it is easy to see that the r-symmetries j+, j (see (2.117)) act

on  by

(9.20)

[j, ] = .

from this and (9.15) we deduce the action on the component elds:

[j, a] = [j, fa] = [j, e] = [j+, +] = [j, ] = 0

[j, ] =

recall from 2.6 that for terms in a lagrangian in m 2|(2,2) involving twisted chiral
elds only we compute component lagrangians using exactly the combination of
derivatives which occurs in the rst term of (9.23). the second term is the topolog-
ical term in (9.10); it does not seem to reduce to an integral r d4. so for re  = 0

the n = 2 superspace yang-mills lagrangian in m 2|(2,2) is

the corresponding component lagrangian is the dimensional reduction of (8.29),

the (classical) theory is invariant under the r-symmetries j+, j, which are
dened in (2.117). this follows either in superspace from (9.20) and (9.24) or in
components from (9.21) and (9.25).

chapter 10
n = 1 yang-mills in dimension 6 and n = 2 yang-mills in
dimension 4

in 10.1 we complete the discussion of the superspace formulation of super
yang-mills theory in 6 dimensions. as in chapter 7 and chapter 8, the main
point is to work out the structure of the auxiliary elds and the r-symmetries.
the proof that the category of component elds (including the auxiliary elds)
is equivalent to the category of superelds is deferred to the next chapter. we
did not succeed in nding a manifestly supersymmetric formula for the lagrangian
in this case. section 10.2 is parallel to chapter 9: we reduce the 6-dimensional
pure gauge theory to 4 dimensions, where it has twice the minimal amount of
supersymmetry. neither theories in 4 dimensions with 8 supersymmetries which
include matter elds nor theories in 4 dimensions with 16 supersymmetries have
superspace formulations which exhibit all of the supersymmetry manifestly. but
they can all be written on m 4|4, where 4 of the supersymmetries are manifest. we
do this in 10.3.
10.1. constrained connections on m 6|(8,0)
we specialize the discussion in 6.3 to m 6|(8,0). our rst task is to evaluate (6.74).
to that end we compute using (2.89)(2.91):

g(cid:0)(f ai, f ck), (fbj, fd)(cid:1) =

chapter 10. n = 1 yang-mills in 6d and n = 2 yang-mills in 4d

107

for a = b this vanishes, since acpq is symmetric in (ac), (pq) whereas f(ac)(pq) is
skew. now evaluate (6.74) for i = j = 1, then i = j = 2, and sum over a = b to
learn

(10.6)

dbj ai =

which has the desired form (6.76).

to proceed further we remark on some linear algebra. for s0 of dimension 4,

the natural map

(10.7)

v2(v2s0) v2s0 v2s0 v3s0  s0,

which is uv 7 vvvu followed by (xy)(zt) 7 (xyz)t(xyt)z,
gives rise to a short exact sequence

0 v2(v2s0) v3s0  s0 v4s0  0.

for s0 given with a volume form,v3s0 is the dual of s0, the map tov4s0 becomes

the evaluation map, and we get

(10.8)

(10.9)

v2(v2s0) = {trace zero endomorphisms of s0}.

this makes it convenient to dene

(10.10)

f a

by (10.9) the tensor f is traceless:

(10.11)

also,

(10.12)

f a
a = 0.

f(ab)(cd) = ebcdf e

then using (10.3) we see that (10.6) simplies to

we need one additional formula

which is equivalent to (11.30) and will be explained in chapter 11.

now we dene the component elds corresponding to a constrained connection.
first, we have a connection a on the restriction p  m 6 of p to minkowski space.
the odd part of the curvature restricts to a dual spinor eld

(10.15)

using (2.95), (2.97), and (6.66) we learn that

j to m 6, which we continue to denote ei

thus(cid:0)ei

j(cid:1) is traceless

j(cid:1) has three independent real components; the matrix(cid:0)1 ei

skew-hermitian (with values in the adjoint bundle). it transforms in the adjoint
representation of the sp(1)r symmetry (2.102). in other words, the auxiliary elds
comprise an imaginary quaternion. the six-dimensional vector multiplet is the
collection of component elds {a, ai, ei
j}.
proposition 10.18. the category of connections a on m 6|(8,0) whose curvature
vanishes on the odd distribution  is equivalent to the category of triples {a, , e}
consisting of a connection a on m 6, a dual spinor eld  with values in the ad-
joint bundle, and an imaginary quaternion scalar eld e with values in the adjoint
bundle.

the proof of proposition 10.18 is presented in chapter 11.

we derive the supersymmetry transformation laws for the components as in
previous sections. denote the restriction of f a
b . then the supersym-
metry transformation aiqai induces the following transformation on component
elds:

b to m 6 by f a

10.2. reduction to m 4|8

the story here is analogous to that in chapter 9, where we reduce yang-mills
on m 4|4 to m 2|(2,2). for a worked out example, see problem ash8 of [i-home-
work].

we consider a constrained connection a on a g-bundle p  m 6|(8,0) which is
constant in the 12, 34 directions. that is, 12 and 34 are lifted to commut-
ing complex conjugate vector elds 12 and 34 on p, and the horizontal vector
elds dai on p satisfy
(10.22)

[ 12,dai] = [ 34,dai] = 0.

set

(10.23)

(34  34).
then applying bianchi to dai, d31, d42 we learn

 =

1
2

(10.24)

d3i = d4i = 0.

from bianchi we also nd, after some tedious computation, a formula for ai in
terms of derivatives of :

(10.25)

2 ai =(cid:26) j a

b ijdbj, a = 1, 2;
j a
b ijdbj, a = 3, 4.

b is the matrix of the pseudoreal structure j described before (2.95). also,

here j a
from (10.6) we learn that dbjai is independent of a, b if i 6= j. it follows that

(10.26)

d11d21 = d31d41
d12d22 = d32d42.

let j : m 4|8  m 6|(8,0) be the inclusion, as described in the last paragraph
of 2.5. we follow the notation introduced there and also use formula (2.104). now
write a, dai, , ai, ei
j for the elds on m 6|(8,0) to distinguish them from their
restrictions to m 4|8. set

(10.27)

 = j .

then using (2.104), equation (10.24) asserts that  is a chiral supereld on m 4|8
in the sense that

(10.28)

d a(i) = 0,

a = 1, 2,

i = 1, 2.

formula (10.25) expresses ai = j ai in terms of . we record the result in full:

from the point of view of m 4|8, we can think of a as a connection whose cur-
vature is constrained to vanish along the odd distribution except for the nontrivial
curvature

(10.31)

and the complex conjugate.

[d 1(2),d 2(1)] = [d 2(2),d 1(1)] = 22 

as in chapter 9 there is a sharp distinction between the abelian and nonabelian
casesin the abelian case  takes values in the constant vector space g, the only
constraint being (10.28); whereas in the nonabelian case  is a section of adp and
the constraint (10.28) involves the connection a, which therefore cannot be derived
solely from .
formulas (10.29) and (10.30) are more understandable if we restrict to m 4|4 
(the inclusion m 4|4  m 6|(8,0) is discussed towards the end of 2.5.)
m 4|8.
let a,  denote the restrictions of a,  to m 4|4. then a is a vector super-
eld (cf. 8.1)a constrained connection on the restriction p of p to m 4|4and
(10.28) implies that  is a chiral supereld (cf. 5.1) with values in ad p. the
pair ( a, ) is called an n = 2 vector multiplet on m 4|4. we claim, but do not
write out a proof, that the category of constrained connections a on m 6|(8,0) which
satisfy (10.22) is equivalent to the category of pairs ( a, ) on m 4|4.
let i : m 4  m 4|8 be the inclusion. motivated by formulas (5.7), and (8.20),
(8.4) we dene the component elds of the superelds on m 4|8 to be

these component elds group together into n = 1 supermultiplets: (a, , e) is an
n = 1 vector multiplet (8.1) and (, , f ) is an n = 1 chiral multiplet (5.1).
the collection (a, , , , e, f ) of all component elds is called an n = 2 vector
multiplet . the reader should check that (10.32) is consistent with (5.7) and (8.20).
the only nontrivial compatibility check is to see that a1 (a = 1, 2) on m 6|(8,0)
restricts on m 4|4 to be the supereld a, with both  and  dened by (6.66); we
leave this check to the reader. note that on m 4|4 we have

wa =

on m 4|4 only half of the supersymmetry of the vector multiplet ( a, ) is mani-
fest. for the rest we write the vector eld  on the space of n = 1 superelds f( a, )
which corresponds to the supersymmetry transformation

the penultimate line of (6.79) is used to derive the rst two of these formulas.

10.3. more theories on m 4|4 with extended supersymmetry

the rest of the hyperkahler structure is encoded in a holomorphic symplectic form.
the moment map h of the g action on x is

(10.49)

h = (r, hol),

where r : x  g is the moment map for the kahler structure and hol : x  g
c
the complex moment map of the holomorphic symplectic structure. the elds in
the model are a constrained connection a on some principal bundle p  m 4|4 and
a chiral supereld  with values in the associated ber bundle x p , where

x = x  gc.

we leave the reader to verify that the component lagrangian (6.42) for these data
is the dimensional reduction of (6.48). as mentioned at the end of 3.4, if  is a
vector eld on x which preserves the hyperkahler structure, then we can use  to
add a term to the superpotential. namely, if  is the holomorphic symplectic form
on x for the particular choice of complex structure we have made, we add to w
the holomorphic function w0 which satises

in other words, w0 is a holomorphic hamiltonian function for the innitesimal

of 5.3). this model does have an su (4) r-symmetry; the su (3) subgroup which
permutes the chiral superelds is manifest in this formulation.42

chapter 11
the vector multiplet on m 6|(8,0)

we prove proposition 10.18, following the treatment in koller (see references).

11.1. complements on m 6|(8,0)

as in 2.1 we write the relevant spinor representation s, complexied, as sc =
s0  w . the real structure comes from pseudoreal structures on s0 and w .
the following lemma gives a convenient description, compatible with the ac-
tion of gl(s0)  gl(w ), of the symmetric and exterior powers of sc. for  a
representation of the symmetric group sn, we note schur(u ) the corresponding
schur functor

(11.1)

one has

(11.2)

schur(u ) := homsn(, u n).

m schur(v )   v n,

the sum running over representatives of the isomorphism classes of irreducible
representations of sn. the map (11.2) is an isomorphism of representations of
gl(v )  sn.
lemma 11.3. let u and v be vector spaces. one has

(11.4)

(11.5)

m schur(u )  schur (v )  symn(u  v )
m schur(u )  schursgn(v ) vn(u  v )

note that  and  are isomorphic. in (11.5) sgn is the sign character of sn.

proof. apply (11.2) to u and v , and take the coinvariants (resp. co-anti-invariants)
by sn.

and (11.6) gives that d(x) vanishes for x in the second factor. by polarization in w
this amounts to saying that for w in w , we have [ds1w, ds2w] = 0. for w 6= 0
xed in w , the dsw (s  s
0 ) span an integrable distribution w; its leaves are
ane spaces with vector space of translations s0  w, parity changed. of course,
w is a complex distribution so that it makes sense to speak of its leaves only after
complexication, at least in the odd direction (cs spaces). one can as well say that
0 , the dsw (w  w ) span an integrable distribution s, with
for s 6= 0 xed in s
leaves ane spaces with vector space of translations s  w .
0  w is the line spanned by s  w. this
line also gives rise to an integrable distribution, with leaves ane spaces of dimen-
sion 0|1, intersections of a leaf of s and a leaf of w.

11.2. constrained connections

let g be a lie group, with lie algebra g. we think to connections  on a
g-torsor p as follows: for each representation r of g, the principal bundle p gives
rise to a vector bundle rp , and  gives connections on the rp , functorially in r
and compatibly with the tensor product.
from this point of view, the curvature f is the gp -valued 2-form such that for
each r, the function ixiy f acts on rp (by the action of gp on rp deduced from
the action of g on r) by [x ,y ]  [x,y ]. the formula
(11.12)
(x)(y )f = [x ,y ]  [x,y ]

chapter 11. the vector multiplet on m 6|(8,0)

117

diers by a sign from the one which holds when x is viewed as a horizontal vector
eld on p lifting x. (see (6.75) for an example of the latter formula.)
a constrained connection is one whose curvature vanishes in the  -direction.
let us write ds for ds and dai for dfaei. the constraint is that, in parallel
to (11.6),

(11.13)

[dai,dbj ] = 2ijab.

a constrained connection is uniquely determined by its restriction to  . for this
restriction, here is what the constraint becomes. for x in sym2(s
c), dene d(x) by
d(st) = [ds ,dt]; the constraint is that d(x) vanishes for x in the second factor
(11.8) of sym2(sc). this amounts to saying that for w in w , the connection is
integrable along the leaves of w. it also amounts to saying that it is integrable
along the leaves of s (s  s

11.3. an auxiliary lie algebra

let l =

l=0l be the graded super lie algebra (with parity = degree modulo 2)

generated in degree 1 by s

(11.15)

sym2(s

0  w , and with relations given by
0 )  sym2(w )  sym2(s
0  w ).

for any constrained connection, the d(s) obey the relations of l: for any represen-
tation r of g, the lie algebra l acts on the local sections of rp . in degree one,
we get the d(s); in degree two, the ab: the connection in the direction of v ; in
degree three, the components fab,ck = [ab,dck] of the curvature, in the moving
frame of 2.5; in degree  3 the action of elements of l is given by sections of gp ,
iterated covariant derivatives of the components of the curvature.
as a preliminary to a description in component elds of constrained connec-
tions, we now analyze l in degree  5. in degree 1, we have a basis dai. in degree
2 we have l2 =v2s
lemma 11.16. the iterated bracket [[dai,dbj],dck] = 2ij[ab,dck] is anti-
symmetric in (a, b, c).

0 , with basis the ab (a < b) dened by (11.13).

proof. by (11.13), the iterated bracket b is antisymmetric in (a, b) and in (i, j).
as i, j, k take only two values, two of them are equal. we consider the cases i = j,
j = k and i = k in turn:

i = j: one has b = 0;
i = k: b = [dai, [dbj ,dck]], which is antisymmetric in (b, c);
j = k: b is similarly antisymmetric in (a, c).

in all cases, antisymmetry in (a, b, c) follows.

from the forthcoming description (proposition 11.33) of constrained connections in
components, one can deduce that the part of degree  2 of the super lie algebra l
is free, with generators the ab, a
i and eij. to prepare for proposition 11.33, we
show here that it is generated by those elements. if l1 is the subalgebra generated
by the ab, a
i and eij, it suces to check that a dai, applied to any of the
generators, is again in l1. it only remains to show that the [dai,ejk] are linear
combinations of the [cd, e

daiejk = cijabb

k

for some constant c is the only possible formula compatible with the grading, the
actions of sl(s

shows c = 2.) here, we will content ourselves to check that, modulo the [, ],
all

(11.31)

vanish.

[dai, [dbj, [dck, [dd,dem]]]] = 4mcdef [dai, [dbj, f

if we antisymmetrize (11.31) in (j, k), we get by (11.27) a [d, [,]], which
jacobi turns into a [, [,d]], i.e., a [, ]. modulo the [, ], this gives the
symmetry of (11.31) in (j, k) and, by (11.29), its antisymmetry in (b, c, d, e).

if a quantity xijk is symmetric in (j, k), to prove its vanishing, it suces to
check the vanishing of its symmetrization yijk in (i, j). indeed, the symmetrization
of y in (j, k) gives xijk back, up to a multiple of the complete symmetrization (of
x or y, this amounts to the same):

(11.32)

yijk + yjki = xijk + (xikj + xjik + xkij ).

to prove the vanishing of (11.31) modulo the [, ], it hence suces to con-
sider its symmetrization (11.31)s in (i, j). in (11.31)s, if we symmetrize in (a, b),
we get 0: a [[dai,dbj] . . . ] symmetrized in (i, j). we conclude that (11.31)s is an-
tisymmetric in (a, b). modulo the [, ], it is also antisymmetric in (b, c, d, e), and
as dim s

0 = 4 < 5, its vanishing follows.

11.4. components of constrained connections

in classical dierential geometry, if n is a subvariety of m and (p,) a torsor
with connection on m , the restriction of (p,) to a formal neighborhood of n is
determined up to unique isomorphism by (a) the restriction (p,) of (p,) to
n , and (b) the value on n of all iterated covariant derivatives of the components
of the curvature of p . the same holds in the super case. in addition, if n is of
codimension 0|s in m , the formal neighborhood of n in m is just m itself.
if the codimension is 0|1, the value on n of the curvature is enough. indeed,
take local coordinates (0, xi), where the xi can be even or odd, for which n is
dened by 0 = 0. a trivialization of p on n extends uniquely to a trivialization s
of p for which 0 s = 0 on n . given a trivialization of p , the connection on p is
given by a g-valued 1-form , while (p,) is given by a g-valued 1-form  on m ,
such that h0, i = 0 on n . let us write  = d0 0b +p dxi(ci + 0di), with b, c,
d functions of the xi. then,  gives the ci, the components f0,i of the curvature,
restricted to n , gives the di and f00 restricted to n gives b.
to handle the case of codimension 0|s, one chooses n  n1  . . .  m ,
each of codimension 0|1 in the next, and one uses induction on s: on ni, after
recovering (p,)|ni, one recovers from the data on n the data on ni of all covariant
derivatives of the components of the curvature, restricted to ni.
let (p,) be a constrained g-torsor on m 6|(8,0). from 11.3, we obtain
i , and gp -valued auxiliary elds eij by restriction to
from it a gp-valued spinor a
minkowski space m 6, we obtain a torsor with connection (p,) on m 6, gp -valued
spinors a
i and gp -valued auxiliary elds eij . by 11.3, all covariant derivatives
of the components of p, restricted to m 6, can be expressed from ,  and e. it
follows that (p,) is determined up to unique isomorphism by (p,, , e). more
precisely, one has the following rephrasing of proposition 10.18.
proposition 11.33. the functor (p,) 7 (p,, , e) is an equivalence of cate-
gories.

for a spelling out of what this means, we refer to the text following proposition 7.5.
we will check proposition 11.33 in the complex setting; the real case results from
it as in the proof of proposition 8.7.
proof. we have to check that any (p,, , e) comes from some constrained (p,).
the at p with , e = 0 corresponds to p at. we now construct vector elds on
the space of connections, tangent to the constrained ones, to get from there to any

chapter 11. the vector multiplet on m 6|(8,0)

121

(p,, , e). rather, we work with the space of connections along  . a deforma-
tion of a connection d in the  direction is given by gp -valued dai. it is tangent
to constrained connections if the symmetrization in (a, b) and (i, j) of [dai,dbj]
vanishes.

we will need the following operators acting on gp :

(11.34)

dab = 1
dijk = 1

2! ijdaidbj,
4! abcddaidbjdckdd,

symmetrized in (a, b)

symmetrized in (i, j, k, ).

they polarize the d2
(11.35)

s and d4

w of (11.14), and from (11.14) we get that

dabdijk = dijkdab = 0

(for their action on sections of gp ).

fix gp -valued elds v ij and consider

(11.36)

dai := jj
if we start from a constrained d, we have

dajdijkv k.

(11.37)

[dai, dbj ]
=kk

daidbkdjkmv m

symmetrized in (a, b), (i, j)

symmetrized in (a, b)

and the (a, b)-symmetrization of daidbk is alternating in (i, k): it is 2ikdab. we
get

. . . = 2dabdjimv m = 0.

the dai is the promised vector eld, tangent to the constrained d.
that:

let () be the ideal dening m 6 in m 6|(8,0). to conclude, it remains to check

(a) for v in ()6, the variation of ab on m depends only on v modulo ()7,
and the ab are changed freely;
i depends only on v modulo ()8, and the
(b) for v in ()7, the variation of a
a
i are changed freely;

(c) for v in ()8, the auxiliary elds e are changed freely.

the variation of [dai,dbj] (resp.
[dai, [dbj, [dck,dd]]]) is
given by 6 (resp. 7, resp. 8) operators d applied to v . for v in ()6 (resp. ()7,
resp. ()8), this variation, restricted to m 6, depends only on v modulo the next
power of () and, to compute it, one may replace each dai by ai. the resulting
simplied computation is left to the reader.

sign manifesto

1. standard mathematical conventions

 we apply the sign rule relentlessly.

this means that when passing from ordinary algebra to z/2-graded, or super,
algebra we pick up a sign (1)|a| |b| when permuting homogeneous elements a, b of
parity |a|,|b|. structure maps (multiplications, lie brackets, inner products, . . . )
are even.
for example, consider a graded complex vector space v = v 0v 1. a hermitian

inner product h,i satises, among other properties,

(a.1)

hv1, v2i = (1)|v1| |v2|hv2, v1i,

v1, v2  v homogeneous.

and from the evenness of the inner product it follows that v 0 is orthogonal to v 1.
from (a.1) we deduce that hv, vi is real for v even and pure imaginary for v odd.
the adjoint t  of a homogeneous linear operator t : v  v is characterized by
(a.2)

ht v1, v2i = (1)|t | |v1|hv1, t v2i.

skew-adjoint operators form a super lie algebra.

 symmetry groups act on the left.

for example, if g is a lie algebra, then an action of g on a vector space v is
a homomorphism g  end(v ). brackets are preserved. on the other hand, an
action of g on a manifold m is an antihomomorphism g  vectorfields(m ). the
reversal of sign comes from the rule f = d
dt exp(t)f and the fact that f 7 uf
is a right action of dieomorphisms (u) on functions (f ).

2. choices

 a hermitian inner product on a complex vector space v is conjugate

 the quantum hamiltonian h is minus the operator which corre-

sponds to innitesimal time translation:

h =  p0.

(a.5)

(a.6)

(a.7)

3. rationale

the rst choice (a.3) is not the usual one in mathematics, but it has its mer-
its. for example, since linear operators act on the left, it makes sense to have the
commuting scalar multiplication act on the right. in mathematics we do follow this
convention for modules over noncommutative rings. with right scalar multiplica-
tion (a.3) reads: hv11, v22i = 1hv1, v2i2. we do not adopt this convention for
scalar multiplication, but do adopt (a.3). physicists like (a.3) in view of diracs
notation hv1|t|v2i for hv1, t v2i. comment: in computations it is often more
convenient and safer to work with a bilinear form rather than a sesquilinear form,
and so to write the sesquilinear inner product as hv1, v2i.
from a mathematical point of view it is more natural to quantize with skew -
adjoint operators, since they form a lie algebra. we use (a.5) to convert to self -
adjoint operators, whose real eigenvalues correspond to physical measurements.

the sign choice in (a.6) leads to the usual bosonic lagrangian (a.20) with a

plus sign in front of the kinetic energy.

in (a.7) we assume that time translation is a symmetry of a quantum theory,
so that the innitesimal generator is represented by a self-adjoint operator p0 on
the quantum (super)hilbert space. the minus sign gives the standard answer for
the hamiltonian of a classical free particle.

current j, which is a twisted (n  1)-form on m . the noether charge q is the
integral of j over a time slice. we usually consider the current and charge only on
the space of classical solutions m, which carries a closed 2-form . the innitesimal
symmetry and noether charge are related by

(a.16)
dq = ().
for (m, ) symplectic, (a.16) can be rewritten
(a.17)
f = {q, f}
for f a function on m.

quantization is, in principle, a map

(a.18)
from functions on m to operators on a complex hilbert space h. we assume
(a.19)

q = q,

q 7 q

so that real functions map to self-adjoint operators.

let p be innitesimal translation in the poincare algebra and qa the odd gen-
erator of the supersymmetry algebra.44 let p, qa be the corresponding quantum
operators.

44the notational conict between the supersymmetry generator and the noether charge is too
ingrained to correct.

5. consequences of 2 on other signs

 the kinetic lagrangian for a scalar eld  : m  r is

(a.20)

l =

1
2|d|2 |dnx| ds =

1
2

g |dnx| ds.

the sign of this term is a consequence of (a.6); it is the main rationale for prefer-
ring (a.6) over the other choice.

 suppose v = v 0  v 1 is a graded hermitian vector space and t an

odd skew-adjoint operator. then

(a.21)

i[t, t ]  0.

observe from (a.2), (a.3) and (a.4) that an odd skew-adjoint operator has eigen-
values on the line i1/2r  c.

 the bracket in the supersymmetry algebra is
abp.

[qa, qb] = 2

(a.22)

because we use left group actions, upon quantization we expect a homomorphism
from the supersymmetry algebra to skew -adjoint operators. using (a.5) we see
that the sign in (a.22) leads to

(a.23)

[i qa,i qb] = 2
ab(i p).
p > 0 for all a. from (a.14) we
setting a = b we see from (a.21) that 2
see that 
aap has nonnegative norm in v . except possibly in dimension 2, the
positive cone generated by {
aap}a includes p0, and so the sign choice in (a.22)
renders the hamiltonian nonnegative (rather than nonpositive), in view of (a.7).

aa

 the vector eld p on f corresponding to innitesimal transla-

tion p is

(a.24)

p f = f,

f  f.

this follows since a dieomorphism  : m  m acts on functions by (1).

 if g is a lie algebra of innitesimal symmetries, then the vector

elds  (  g) on the space of elds f satisfy

(a.25)

[1 , 2 ] = [1,2].

 the noether currents satisfy 45

(a.26)

{j1, j2} = j[1,2].

45the bracketing operation on noether currents is dened in [i-classical fields, 2.6].

126

p. deligne, d. freed, supersolutions

 the noether charges satisfy

(a.27)

{q1, q2} = q[1,2].

 the quantum operators satisfy

(a.28)

[i q1,i q2] = i q[1,2].

equations (a.25)(a.27) follow from the fact that g  vectorfields(f ) is an
antihomorphism and the standard equations for poisson brackets which follow
from (a.16). equation (a.28) says that g  end(h) is a homomorphism to skew-
adjoint operators, where we use (a.5).

 the self -adjoint quantum operators q1, q2 which correspond to

classical functions q1, q2 on m satisfy

(a.29)

[ q1, q2] = i{q1, q2} modulo o(2).

to the extent that (a.29) holds exactly, it says that the map

(a.30)

q 7 i



q

to skew-adjoint operators is an antihomorphism. the sign in (a.30) is dictated
by (a.5). the desire to have an antihomomorphism is dictated by (a.27) and (a.28),
and this determines the sign in (a.29).

 the schrodinger equation for the evolution of a state  is

(a.31)


t

= i



h.

evolution through time t for a static hamiltonian h is eit h/.

the sign follows from (a.7) and (a.5).

 let a

1 , b

2 be odd parameters and i the even vector eld on f

corresponding to a

i qa. then

(a.32)

[ 1, 2]f = 2a

1 b

2

abf,

f  f.

to see this, observe from (a.22) that in the abstract supersymmetry algebra we
have

(a.33)

[a

1 qa, b

2qb] = 2a

1 b

2

abp.

then (a.32) follows from (a.25) and (a.24); the minus signs in these two equations
cancel.

 if 1, 2 are complex classical odd quantities, then complex conju-

gation satises

(a.34)

12 = 1 2.

appendix. sign manifesto

127

this is a consequence of the sign rule if we assume that  7  is a -operation
and 1 (super)commutes with 2. (a  operation satises (ab) = (1)|a| |b| ba.)
notice that the classical statement (a.34) is consistent with the quantum state-
ment (a.19), since the adjoint operation on linear operators is also a  operation.
notice that the product of real commuting odd quantities is real.

 the kinetic lagrangian for a spinor eld  : m  s is

(a.35)

l =

1
2

d/ |dnx| ds =

1
2

abab |dnx| ds.

 the kinetic lagrangian for a dual spinor eld  : m  s is

(a.36)

l =

1
2

d/ |dnx| ds =

1
2


abab |dnx| ds.

the spinor elds are odd. in view of (a.34), the lagrangians (a.35) and (a.36) are
real, as they must be in minkowski space. it is easiest to check the sign in classical
mechanics (n = 1). then from (a.35) we deduce46 the classical poisson bracket

(a.37)

{, } = 1.

upon quantization we know the corresponding operators satisfy (a.29). the sign
in (a.37) is compatible with (a.21), and this means that the sign in (a.35) is
correct.

 the energy-momentum tensor is minus the noether current of p.

the supercurrent is minus the noether current of qa.

this is a denition and follows by superpoincare invariance from the denition (a.7)
of the hamiltonian. it means that the charges computed from the energy-momentum
tensor are energy and minus momentum.

6. dierential forms

 when computing with dierential forms on superspace, we use a

bigraded point of view.47

objects have a cohomological degree, corresponding to a classical (that is, non-
super) degree, and a parity. the permutation of objects of parity p1, p2 and co-
homological degree d1, d2 introduces two signs: a classical sign (1)d1d2 and an
additional factor (1)p1p2 .

 on rp|q with coordinates t1, . . . tp, 1, . . . q we have the following

table of parities and cohomological degrees:

therefore, by the sign rule, for a tangent vector  and a 1-form  there is a sign48

parity.

 for integration over odd variables we have

z d  = 1

z d2d1 12 =z d2(cid:18)z d1 1(cid:19) 2 = 1.
 for any vector eld  we have the cartan formula

(a.38)

lie() = [d, ()].

both sides of (a.38) act on dierential or integral forms.

7. miscellaneous signs

 let x be a smooth manifold,  a vector eld on x, t the one-
parameter group of dieomorphisms generated, and t a tensor
eld. then

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0 (t)t.

 on a kahler manifold x the riemannian metric g, kahler form ,
complex structure j, and a local kahler potential k are related by
the equations

 suppose f is a (suitable) function on a vector space v of dimen-
sion n. then f and its fourier transform f on v  are related
by

 suppose g is the lie algebra of a real lie group g. then the com-
plexied lie algebra gc = g  c carries a conjugation whose set of
real points is g.

for example, starting with the unitary group g = u (n), we obtain the conjugation
a 7 a on complex n  n matrices. (a is the conjugate transpose of a.)

70s and 80s. it is hopeless for us to reference all of the original papers. our more

more specialized references we used.
