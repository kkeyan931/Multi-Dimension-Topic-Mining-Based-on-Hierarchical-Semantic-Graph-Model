(4.43) one insert set observables in(b) supported b gener- ating function x: z x =*exp(cid:16)xk fkok +xn gnin(s) +xn tnin(b)(cid:17)+ . (4.44) according formulation marino moore {$9802185$}, eect blowup u-plane integral modify integrand x follows: 1. accordance decomposition h2 mentioned above, photon partition function x becomes product x theta function even half-characteristic: x = (xn tnvn | )x , = (1/2, , 1/2). (4.45) 2. exponential function containing contact terms undergoes new con- tribution observables supported b, appear mul- tiplicative factor exp(xm,n tmntmtn).

(4.47) 19 let us consider product rst two factors (i.e., gaussian theta function), call 0,(~t): 0,(~t) = exp(xm,n tmntmtn)(xn tnvn | ). (4.48) marino moore {$9802185$} remarked essentially tau function toda system. precisely, mentioned, diers true tau function 0,(~t) gaussian factor exp(2iqsing(~t)), qsing(~t) quadratic form coecients qsing mn . thus 0,(~t) = exp(qsing(~t))0,(~t) = exp(2i(q(~t) qsing(~t))(xn tnvn | ). (4.49) since subtracted term qsing(~t) modular invariant, modication spoil modular transformation 0,(~t); subtraction necessary correct semi-classical behavior integrand u-plane integral. moreover, according marino , third factor blowup process nothing inverse zero-value 0,(~t): ab1 = 1 0,(~0) , ~0 = (0, 0, ). product three factor thus boils tau quotient 0,(~t) 0,(~0) = 0,(~t) 0,(~0) . (4.50) (4.51) since 0,(~t) 0,(~0) modular property, quotient modular invariant property required consistency u-plane integral. furthermore, quotient non-singular semi-classical region u-plane. basis requirements, marino  eventually derives theta formula tmn = 2i log (0 | ) tjk v (m) j v (n) k , (4.52) thus reproducing theta formula gorsky et al. {$9505075$} entirely dier- ent route. result also also shows theta function e formula gorsky et al. actually given . 5 conclusion seen new aspects integrable systems discovered recent studies n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories topologically twisted versions. particularly impressive lesson combination whitham 20 deformations tau functions surprisingly powerful tool. fact demonstrated marinos beautiful exposition , part reviewed last section. number problems still remain addressed. central issue extend present approach based integrable systems cases, theories matter multiplets, exceptional gauge groups, etc. contact terms blowup formula theories matter multiplets studied extent . perhaps intriguing theories adjoint matter multiplet (equivalently, mass deformed n = 4 theo- ries). blowup formula topological versions theories, too, described tau function (of elliptic calogero-moser system?). an- interesting case found toroidally compactied tensionless strings (also called e-strings) related n = 2 mass deformed n = 4 gauge the- ories . e8 theta function e8 arising models connected tau function yet unidentied integrable system underlying seiberg-witten curves theories. acknowledgements grateful toshio nakatsu, masahiko saito, yuji shimizu yasuhiko yamada useful discussions. work partly supported grant-in- aid scientic research (no. 10640165) ministry education, science culture.
