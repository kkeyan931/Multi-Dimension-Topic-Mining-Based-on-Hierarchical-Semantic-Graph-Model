(in writing o(n) careful distinguishing o(n), so(n), spin (n), etc. issues important later.) wz term r p+1 = r c (p+1) shows dp-brane source c (p+1) one unit rr charge. like dynamical objects, d-branes sources gravitational eld giving rise spacetime curvature. famous ads/cft duality {$9805019$} geometry plays crucial role. one considers large n limit holding hooft parameter = g2 n xed. string coupling g = g2 goes zero limit. eect n d-branes geometry controlled n tdp gn n 1 g g2 gn, (14) gn newtons constant 10d. combination held xed ads/cft story. however, concerned dierent limit, namely g 0 n xed. limit eect d-branes geometry ignored leading order, one simply regard hypersurfaces embedded minkowski spacetime, do. reasoning reliable branes suciently low dimension (or high co-dimension) gravitational elds fall distance branes. otherwise, case d8-branes type theory, eect geometry cannot ignored. also worth noting decoupling geometry would work ns 5-branes, 1/g2. 2.3 duality d-branes let us consider duality {$9805019$} works d-branes simplest setting, namely spacetime r9 s1, single circular dimension x9 x radius r. corre- sponding string world-sheet eld x(, ) takes form x = mr + n r + periodic terms. (15) describes closed string winding number = kaluzaklein (kk) momentum = n. decomposing x left-moving right-moving parts xl( + ) xr( ), xl = xr = 1 2(cid:18)mr + 2(cid:18)mr 1 n r(cid:19) ( + ) + . . . r(cid:19) ( ) + . . . . n t-duality transformation xr xr, xl unchanged. thus x = xl + xr xl xr = 8 n r + mr + . . . . (16) (17) comparing original x, see describes closed string circle radius 1/r winding number = n kk momentum = m. r 9 world-sheet supersymmetry requires transformation xr xr accom- panied 9 r. consequence reversing right-moving chirality projection, particular 11 11. therefore follows iia iib. thus, reca- pitulate, iia theory compactied circle radius r equivalent iib theory circle radius 1/r role winding number kk excitation number interchanged map. let us examine implications d-branes. suppose, example, start pair parallel dp-branes positions given #1 : x = di 1 = p + 1, . . . , 9 #2 : x = di 2 = p + 1, . . . , 9. (18) (19) thus branes dimensions x m, = 0, 1, . . . , p localized 9 p dimensions. open string connecting two d-branes satises neumann boundary conditions rst p + 1 dimensions x m|= = 0, = 0, . . . , p dirichlet boundary conditions remaining 9 p dimensions = p + 1, . . . , 9. x i|=0 = di 1, x i|= = di 2, solving 2d wave equation boundary conditions gives x = xm + pm + ixn6=0 +xn6=0 2 di 1) 1 + (di x = di n n cos n ein n n sin n ein . (20) (21) (22) (23) suppose x 9 circle before. happens dp-branes t-duality transformation? easy see xr xr simply interchanges dirichlet neumann boundary conditions. therefore d-branes, assumed localized original circle radius r, wrapped t-dual circle radius 1/r. thus t-dual theory d(p+1)-branes, wrapped circular dimension. thus general rule duality: unwrapped dp wrapped d(p + 1). meshes nicely fact bps dp-branes exist iia theory even values p iib theory odd values p. 9 question arises. t-dual description, d-branes wrapped dual circle, positions original circle encoded? clearly, information must lost, since transformation invertible. key answering question recall duality interchanges winding number kk excitation number. however, original conguration charged states fractional winding associated open strings connect two d-branes. dual description charge states fractional kk number. achieved wilson lines exp world- volume gauge theories wrapped d-branes. words, component gauge elds along circle encodes position original dp-branes circle. 2.4 type superstrings modern construction type superstring theory (not way originally devel- oped) orientifold projection type iib theory . recall type iib theory, fermions associated left-movers right-movers chirality. result world-sheet theory z2 symmetry corresponding interchange left-movers right-movers l x x r, l r. (24) equivalently, one speak world-sheet parity , reects spatial world-sheet coordinate ( 2 ). one can, therefore, project spectrum theory onto left-right symmetric subspace using projection operator 1 2 (1 + ). result give closed string restricted set excitations. type closed-string, unoriented. interacting theory type closed strings consistent itself. fact understood variety ways. one thing chiral theory n = 1 supersymmetry (16 supercharges), gravitational anomalies. achieve consistency one must add twisted sector, consists open strings. strings whose ends associated xed points orientifold projection ( = 0 = ). also unoriented. known anomaly cancellation requirement open strings carry so(32) chanpaton charges ends, since chanpaton gauge group anomalies cancelled {$9805170$}. (e8 e8 cannot realized way.) orientifold projection construction interpreted giving rise spacetime lling orientifold plane o9-plane. reason lls entire space-time every x xed point , act x. o9-plane carries 32 units rr charge. charge needs cancelled. achieved adding 32 d9-branes, also entire spacetime. so(32) gauge elds arise zero modes open strings 10 connect pair d-branes. (these open strings introduced earlier.) type ii theories coincident d-branes give u(n) gauge groups, open strings oriented. orthogonal symplectic gauge groups. type theory unoriented, therefore one obtains 2.5 t-dual description type theory section 2.3 saw duality circle s1 corresponds xr xr (and r r), implies x = xl + xr x = xl xr. (25) case type ii theories, x describes dual circle s1 radius r = 1/r. type theory constructed gauging world-sheet parity symmetry type iib theory. corresponds xl xr (and l r). thus, see t-dual description action gives x x . gauging therefore gives orbifold projection dual circle: s1/z2 {$9805170$}. orbifold describes interval 0 x r. (26) alternative viewpoint entire circle s1 present, happens semicircle r x 2r determined semicircle. generally, duality along n-torus n results orbifold n/in. denotes simultaneous inversion n coordinates torus n. precisely, inversion carried simultaneously orientation reversal non-compact coordinates (x l x r). fermions transformed time. case circle (n = 1), t-dual theory regarded type iia orientifold form (r9 s1)/ i1. (27) combined operation i1 relevant z2 projection case. resulting theory t-dual description type theory compactied circle called type theory. (sometimes alternative name type ia used.) duality setting equivalence type theory type iib orientifold (r9 s1)/, (28) compactied type theory. ends interval x = 0, r xed-point set iia orientifold pro- jection, and, therefore, locations orientifold planes o8-planes. 11 orientifold planes regarded carrying 8 units rr charge. consistency type theory requires adding 16 d8-branes cancel rr charges. parallel o8-planes, means localized points interval 0 x r, nine dimensions. addition 16 mirror image d8-branes half circle (r x 2r). altogether, 32 d8-branes t-duals 32 d9-branes type description. position d8-branes along interval type description determined type description wilson lines. wilson line element so(32) equivalence transformation brought canonical form written 16 blocks so(2) matrices, characterized angles = x i/r, = 1, 2, . . . , 16. (29) positions 16 dual d8-branes, mirror images located x 2r x i. introducing wilson line compactied type theory, one breaks so(32) gauge group subgroup commutes wilson line matrix. expressed terms type description, gives following rules: n d8-branes coincide interior interval, give unbroken u(n) gauge group. n d8-branes coincide one o8-planes, give unbroken so(2n) gauge group. cases gauge bosons arise zero modes d8 d8 open strings. second case, additional symmetry enhancement traced open strings connecting d8- branes mirror-image d8-branes. case trivial wilson line (w = 1) corresponds 16 d8-branes coin- cide one o8-planes, gives expected unbroken so(32) gauge symmetry. noted two additional u(1)s cannot pictured terms d-branes. rather associated gauge elds g9 b9 dened bulk. one linear combination gauge elds belongs 9d supergravity multiplet. another linear combination belongs 9d vector supermultiplet. latter participate symmetry enhancement special cases . example, wilson line w = i16+2n 0 0 i162n ! generically gives gauge symmetry so(16 + 2n) so(16 2n) u(1)2. 12 (30) (31) however, s-dual perturbative heterotic theory one knows additional gauge symmetry enhancement. so(16 2n) u(1) e9n , (32) specic value compactication radius. type units, radius given r2 = gn/8. explore issue lectures. 3 d-brane anti-d-brane systems one superposes bps dp-brane bps dp-brane system longer bps, unstable. basic idea open string connecting spectrum based gso projection reverse usual one, result ground state tachyon, signals instability. one method deriving result consider starting pair coincident dp-branes imagine rotating one angle thereby turning dp-brane {$9805170$}. intermediate angles intersection takes place p1 spatial dimensions. working implications dirichlet neumann boundary conditions arbitrary angles continuing = 0 = , one deduce reversal gso projection. occurrence tachyon = physically sensible, course, signals possibility annihilation, longer prevented charge conservation. begin discussing systems type ii theories move type theory. case, interested exploring possibility setting eld congurations dp + dp system something stable survives annihilation takes place. 3.1 type ii dp + dp systems case type ii theories open strings connecting d-branes oriented, result tachyonic mode dp dp open string complex. denoting tachyon eld (p + 1)-dimensional world volume , one combine gauge elds superconnection form = ! . (33) u(1) gauge eld associated dp-brane u(1) gauge eld associated dp-brane. tachyon charged respect them. generally, one could consider n dp-branes n dp-branes. would u(n) gauge 13 elds, would u(n ) gauge elds, would n n matrix transforming (n, n ). start with, restrict consideration case n = n = 1. explicit example happen, let us (following sen {$9805170$}) consider d2 + d2 system wrapped rectangular torus radii r1, r2. discussed earlier, wz term d2-brane z (cef )3 =zt 2r (c3 + c1 f ). (34) formula shows magnetic ux torus rt 2 f source c1. words, d2-brane magnetic ux carries d0-brane charge. suppose d2 d2 one unit d0-brane charge. assuming constant elds, means f12 = f 12 = 2 v , (35) v = (2r1)(2r2) volume torus. let us examine system described t-dual viewpoint. t-dual description (which also type iia, since torus even dimension) get dual torus 2 radii ri = 1/ri. matching coupling constants eight dimensions one learns v g2 = v g2 , (36) hence g = g/(r1r2). (37) since t-duality transformation interchanges d0 d2, uxes gave d0-brane charges imply dual system two d2-branes wrapping t2. two coincident type ii d-branes, system u(2) gauge symmetry. original d2 d2 give rise d0 one d2 d0 other. thus dual magnetic ux f12 = 2 v 1 0 0 1 ! . (38) original d2 + d2 system complex tachyon, signaling instability, t- duality transformation certainly doesnt change fact. however, instability attributable structure ux matrix. minimum energy conguration corresponds f12 = 0, corresponds annihilation d0 + d0. nontrivial fact, sen demonstrated, ux eq. (38) continuously connected f12 = 0. deformation corresponds tachyon rolling minimum dual picture. thus left pair wrapped d2-branes ux. total mass minimum (ignoring contribution radiation emitted annihilation process) = 2 v td2 = 2 42r1r2 1 42g = 2 g = 2td0. (39) 14 calculation shows mass two d0-branes original picture. means original torus mass density m/v vanishes limit large v . implies tachyon potential minimum precisely cancels d-brane tension. specically 2td2 + v (t0) = 0, (40) |t| = t0 (assumed) position minimum. reasoning generalizes arbitrary dimensions branes. general conclusion coincident dp-brane +dp-brane system tachyon eld minimum equivalent pure vacuum. result makes good sense. also insightful viewpoint. 3.2 vortex solutions let us consider d2 + d2 system r10. already noted, tachyon charge (1,1) respect u(1)u(1) gauge symmetry. tachyon potential v (t ) gauge invariant. therefore, depend magnitude |t|, minimum assumed occur |t| = t0. kinetic term |dt|2, dt = ( ia + ia )t. (41) single d0-brane described vortex solution innite d2 + d2 system {$9808141$}. working polar coordinates (r, ) want describe vortex localized vicinity r = 0. want eld conguration describe pure vacuum large r, topologically nontrivial way. achieved requiring r t0ei 1. (42) ensure dt 0 v (t ) v (t0), energy density cancels large r leaving soliton small r region. see conguration quantum numbers d0-brane, since (a )d = 2 12)dx1dx2 = 2. (43) (44) implies ilarge circle z (f12 f see relative u(1) group matters. could, example, set = 0. case, conclude one unit magnetic ux, required d0-brane. result extends trivially larger values p simply adding additional inert di- rections. conclusion d(p 2)-brane described vortex solution 15 dp + dp system. fact carries correct rr charge understood consequence coupling z cp1 dtd , required consistency picture. term elegantly described us- ing superconnection a, following kennedy wilkins {$9805170$}. first one introduces supercurvature f = da + aa = f dt dt f ! , even-dimensional forms diagonal, odd-dimensional ones o- diagonal. using one construct suggestive generalization wz term brane- antibrane systems, namely (45) (46) (47) (48) swz =z cst r(ef). z c(ef ef ), symbol st r usual super-trace graded algebras. contains usual terms minus sign reects opposite rr charges. also contains term eq.

(54) rst formula standard instanton conguration gives one unit instanton number 1 8zr4 tr(ff ) = 1. (55) structure wz term implies conguration carries one unit d1- brane rr charge identied d-string. various properties d-string, various zero modes, also derived construction, pursue here. construction described based work sen. however, pointed something closely related done earlier douglas {$9808141$}. specically, douglas considered instanton conguration single d5-brane argued describes d-string bound d5-brane. let us turn construction d5-brane soliton. purpose need consider four d9-branes four d9-branes addition usual 32 d9-branes present type vacuum conguration. chan-paton group d9s, say, so(4) = su(2) su(2). (56) idea introduce instanton conguration one su(2)s accompany appropriate tachyon conguration rather like one previous construction. way one makes d5-brane. moreover, su(2), used instanton construction, survives gauge symmetry d5-brane. so(32) gauge symmetry carried d9-branes inert construction survives global symmetry d5-brane world-volume theory. (this also true d-string previous construction.) 3.5 non-bps d0-brane type perturbative so(32) heterotic string spectrum spin(32)/z2 spinor representation rst excited level. even bps, belongs long representation 19 supersymmetry algebra, nonetheless absolutely stable consequence charge conservation. heterotic string units, mass mspinor = 2f (gh), (57) f (gh) = 1 + o(g2 h). sen {$9808141$} posed question happens state gh ? bps state, answer would trivial, charge would control mass values coupling. however, state bps, answer obvious. however, one hope answer question large gh corresponds small g = 1/gh type coupling. thus one needs identify plausible candidate lightest gauge group spinor type setting determine mass leading order g. ordinarily, type iib theory stable d0-branes, though section 3.3 dis- cussed construct unstable d0-brane. however, presence orientifold (or orbifold) plane exist stable particles embedded orientifold (or orbifold) plane. one viewpoint orientifold projection eliminates tachyonic modes world-volume unstable type ii d-brane. sen studied possibilities o5-planes o9-planes. consider latter case, realized uncompactied type theory. construct type candidate desired gauge group spinor d0-brane. procedure based setting like preceding sections. namely, following sen, construct d1 + d1 system eld conguration describes stable soliton. already remarked, gauge group world volume n coincident type d-strings o(n). particular, case single d-string, o(1) = z2. z2 subgroup u(1) type iib d-string survives orientifold projection. discrete, gauge group associated eld, physical consequences. point gauge group determines possible wilson lines string wrapped circular compact dimension. thus possible wilson lines wrapped d-string w = 1. d-string 32 left-moving fermion elds world sheet, arise zero modes d1 d9 open strings. (this also known identication d-string heterotic string.) possible wilson lines (or holonomies) w = 1 correspond whether elds wrapped d-string periodic antiperiodic a(x + 2r) = w a(x). (58) w = 1, zero modes fourier expansions, obey cliord algebra. therefore, quantum states wrapped d-string w = 1 belong 20 spinor conjugacy class spin(32)/z2. similarly, states wrapped d-string w = 1 belong adjoint (or singlet) conjugacy class. consider d1 + d1 pair wrapped circle coincident dimen- sions. get overall gauge group spinor one strings w = 1 w = 1. case clear (by charge conservation) complete annihilation strings possible. wrapped d1 + d1 system contains real tachyon eld potential v (t ). odd action either z2 gauge groups, therefore gauge invariance requires v (t ) = v (t ). reasoning before, v isolated minimum |t| = t0 v (t0) + 2td1 = 0. wilson lines same, product +1 system gauge group singlet, (x) periodic possible choose (x) = t0. would equivalent pure vacuum. however, product wilson lines 1, (x) forced antiperiodic (x + 2r) = (x), (59) (x) = t0 longer possibility. fourier series expansion form indeed, case tachyon eld (x, t) =xn tn+1/2(t)ei(n+1/2)x/r. tells us kk mass nth mode (n + 1/2)2 2 n = 1 2 . r2 shows actually instability r < rc, rc = 1/2.

(64) complete story let us describe d0-brane soliton d1 + d1 system decompactication limit. case localized kink, like ones described section 3.3. present case (x) real vacuum manifold |t| = t0 consists two distinct points. thus kink conguration topologically nontrivial. follows resulting d0-brane carries conserved z2 charge. means whereas individually stable, tcp self-conjugate annihilate pairs. meshes nicely fact gauge group spinors. 4 k-theory classication d-branes 4.1 motivation background since d-branes carry conserved charges sources rr gauge elds, dierential forms, one might suppose charges could identied cohomology classes. roughly, precisely, correct. moore minasian noted precise mathematical identication d-brane charges elements k-theory groups {$9710230$}. explained detail subsequent paper witten {$9810188$}. here, summarize basic ideas, though go deeply mathematics. wittens explanation begins observation pattern bps d-branes reminiscent bott periodicity rules homotopy groups. example, i(u(n)) = i(u(n + 2)), (65) n suciently large (the stable regime). pattern reminiscent fact bps d-branes occur even values p iia theory odd values p iib theory, gauge group n coincident type ii d-branes u(n). bott periodicity rule i(o(n)) = i4(sp(n)), (66) 22 suciently large n, reminiscent pattern bps d-branes type theory. type i, n coincident d1-branes d9-branes o(n) gauge group (roughly), whereas n coincident d5-branes sp(n) gauge group. challenge nd right mathematical framework explain coincidences account non-bps d-branes, well. k-theory turns key. provides classication pairs vector bundles equivalence relations mesh nicely learned sens studies. let us rst discuss relevance homotopy groups. world-volume theories gauge theories, (as seen) support solitons. solitons tend stable topologically nontrivial lump codimension n. eld conguration represents nontrivial element n1(g) identied conserved rr charge. thus, example, case non-bps d0-brane used fact 0(z2) = z2 describe codimension one lump d1 + d1 system. similarly, used 3(su(2)) = z construct d-string d5 + d5 system. type ii theories, vortex solutions utilized fact 1(u(1)) = z. instead constructions listed above, could constructed objects suitable bundles space-time lling nine-branes. point view, would understand existence type d-string consequence non-bps d0-brane consequence 7(o(32)) = z, 8(o(32)) = z2. (67) (68) everything group theory topology, however. dynamics also matters. codimension n greater four, two cases, lump cannot described extremum low-energy eective action se =z dnx tr(fijf ij). (69) see this, suppose ai(x) eld conguration desired topology. (more precisely one denes bundle collection ais open sets together suitable transition functions.) lets rescale gauge eld follows ai(x) ai(x), (70) sends fij(x) 2fij(x). thus, one nds se 4nse. therefore, n > 4 action (or energy) reduced shrinking soliton. presumably shrinks string 23 scale stabilized competing eects higher-dimension corrections se. thus, string scale characterize thickness d-string d0-brane. suppose, hand soliton co-dimension n < 4. case scaling argument would suggest soliton wants spread become diuse. doesnt always happen, eects stabilize soliton, issue considered. 4.2 type ii d-branes consider collection coincident type ii d-branes n dp-branes n dp-branes. discussed section 3.1, important world-volume elds combined superconnection = ! , (71) connection u(n) vector bundle e, connection u(n ) vector bundle e, section e e.

(72) specic example, consider case p = 9 type iib theory. consistency quantum theory (tadpole cancellation) requires total rr 9-brane charge vanish, thus n = n . equal number d9-branes d9-branes lling 10d spacetime x. associated pair vector bundles (e, e), e e rank n complex vector bundles. want dene equivalence pairs (e, e) (f, f ) whenever associated 9-brane systems related brane- antibrane annihilation creation. particular, e e corresponds pure vacuum, therefore add d9-branes d9-branes identical vector bundles h, give anything new, since allowed annihilate. means (e, e) 0 e e. (73) (e h, e h) (e, e). (74) way form equivalence classes pairs bundles. classes form abelian group. example, (e, e) belongs inverse class class containing (e, e). 24 n n unrestricted, group called k(x). however, group constructed subgroup k(x) dened requiring n = n . subgroup called k(x). thus type iib d-brane charges classied elements k(x). lets examine whether works. formalism quite general, begin consider relatively simple case dp-branes hyperplanes r10. purpose natural decompose space tangential normal directions r10 = rp+1 r9p, (75) consider bundles independent tangential rp+1 coordinates. elds fall suciently innity, energy normalizable, add point innity thereby compactifying normal space becomes topologically sphere s9p. relevant base space dp-brane bundles x = s9p. invoke mathematical results: k(s9p) =( z p = odd 0 p = even . (76) precisely accounts rr charge stable (bps) dp-branes type iib theory r10. relation homotopy k(sn) = n1(u(n)) (large n). (77) note n appear left-hand side. k-theory groups automatically stable regime. also noted unstable type iib d-branes, discussed section 3.3, carry conserved charges, show classication. suppose dimensions form compact manifold q dimension q, total spacetime r10qq. construction dp-brane requires compactifying normal space r9pq q give s9pq q. involves adjoining copy q innity. case appropriate mathematical objects classify d-brane charges relative k-theory groups k(s9pq q, q) {$9805019$}. particular, q = s1, k(s8p s1, s1). mathematically, known relative k-theory group decomposed two pieces k(x s1, s1) = k 1(x) k(x). (78) physical interpretation formula nice. d-branes wrapped circle, whereas k(s8p) classies type iib k 1(s8p) = k(s9p), 25 (79) classies unwrapped d-branes. so, altogether, nine dimensions additive d-brane charges p < 8. type iia case somewhat subtle, since spacetime lling d9-branes unstable case. also, tcp self-conjugate. right k-theory group conjectured witten, subsequently explained horava {$9805170$}. answer k 1(x), (as already indicated) k 1(s9p) =( z p = even 0 p = odd. (80) accounts stable type iia dp-branes embedded r10. relation homotopy case k 1(sn) = n1 u(2n) u(n) u(n)!

(81) (82) time k 1(x) describes wrapped d-branes k(x) describes unwrapped ones. result matches type iib result exactly way required duality (wrapped unwrapped) {$9805019$}. 4.3 type d-branes type d-branes charges also classied using k-theory {$9810188$}. case consider n + 32 d9-branes o(n + 32) vector bundle e n d9-branes o(n) vector bundle e. dene equivalence classes (e, e) (e h, e h), (83) h arbitrary so(k) vector bundle x. equivalence classes dene elements k-theory group. rank e rank e unrestricted group would ko(x). one dene subgroup ko(x), called gko(x), requiring rank e = rank e + 32. coset isomorphic gko(x), far k-theory concerned fact e. however, quite want. type theory requires rank e = rank type theory 32 extra d9-branes irrelevant. however, later show quite relevant physics. already see k-theory whole story. 26 case, reasoning before, conserved charges type d-branes r10 determined groups gko(s9p). connection homotopy case (large n). (84) results follows: gko(sn) = n1(o(n)) three kinds bps d-branes carry additive conserved charges. gko(s9p) = z p = 1, 5, 9. gko(s9p) = z2 candidates non-bps d-branes multiplicative (z2) conserved charges. p = 0 case corresponds non-bps d0-brane discussed section 3.5. p = 1 case type d-instanton. p = 7 p = 8 cases discussed section 6. p = 1, 0, 7, 8. gko(s9p) = 0 p = 2, 3, 4, 6. conserved d-brane charges cases. let us consider compactifying type theory circle, spacetime r9 s1. case want understand classication d-brane charges nine dimensions t-dual description terms type theory. type ii cases, k-theory description d-brane charges compactied theory given relative k-theory group ko(x s1, s1). type ii case, mathematical identity ko(x s1, s1) = gko (x) gko(x), 1 (85) 1 agrees physical expectations. specically, gko(s8p) classies wrapped d- branes gko slightly subtle point. k-theory group elements correspond conserved charges stable d-branes. section 3.5 saw type non-bps d0- (s8p) describes unwrapped d-branes. brane decays two particles, described wrapped d1 + d1 system compactication radius r < 1/2. wrapped d-string trivial wilson line (w = 1) gauge group spinor, carries charge question. k-theory classication charges distinguish cases r < 1/2 r > 1/2. classies charges, doesnt identify object ground state charge. let us examine situation t-dual type perspective {$9805019$}. particular, would like achieve qualitative understanding transition r = 1/2 (r = 2). transcribe picture type perspective recall duality wrapped d-branes map unwrapped d-branes vice versa. recall, too, position 27 unwrapped d-brane encoded wilson line corresponding wrapped d-brane. thus, non-bps d0-brane type localized circle (for r > 1/2) correspond non-bps d1-brane type stretched across interval x = 0 x = r. wilson line u(1) gauge group string encode position d0-brane. r < 1/2 (and r > 2), hand, type picture one wrapped d1+d1 pair. one strings w = +1 one w = 1. strings correspond d0-branes dual type picture, wilson lines tell us d0-branes stuck orientifold planes. thus, specic, d0-brane stuck o8-plane x = 0 d0-brane stuck o8-plane x = r. interesting question conguration morphs string stretched across interval r decreased value 2. conjecture answer question, goes beyond perturbative framework working. reminiscent similar phenomena found contexts, smooth way imagine transition taking place. idea r approaches 2 above, orientifold planes develop spikes d0 d0 approach one another. limit r 2 touch annihilate, leaving connecting tube o8- planes, perturbative limit identied string. somewhat analogous joining/breaking transition qcd ux tubes annihilation/creation q q pairs. also reminiscent description fundamental strings ending d-branes terms soliton eld conguration d-brane world-volume . however, diers examples rather peculiar way. case, inside tube, identied stretched non-bps d-string, even part spacetime! seen d0-branes stuck o8-planes type theory. t-dual fact wrapped type d-string wilson line w = 1, two possibilities corresponding two orientifold planes. incidentally, implies certain asymmetry orientifold planes, since w = 1 gives gauge group spinor w = 1 not. bulk type spacetime indistinguishable type iia spacetime, least region half d8-branes left half right.

(such instability occurs dp dq open strings whenever 0 < |p q| < 4.) instability not, itself, constitute contradiction k-theory analysis, purports give types conserved d-brane charges, specic objects carry them. cause concern. clearly, instability occurs cases 32 spacetime lling d9-branes type vacuum. pointed earlier, k-theory analysis indierent presence. question extent z2 charge survives d7 d8 dissolves background d9-branes. 6.3 analysis d8 bott periodicity, one might expect non-bps d8-brane features common non-bps d0-brane. one essential dierence, however, d0 d9 open strings tachyonic modes whereas d8 d9 open strings do. conrm fact trying emulate sens construction d0-brane kink solution d1 + d1 system {$9805019$}. case d1 + d1 system saw single real tachyon 33 potential v (t ) minima = t0, regarded 0-dimensional sphere. vacuum manifold two disconnected components and, therefore, kink solution connects topologically stable. closest analog construct eight dimensions higher consider system consisting 33 d9-branes one d9-brane. world volume case 33 tachyonic modes ~t belonging fundamental representation o(33) gauge symmetry carried d9-branes. potential v ( ~t ) must o(33) gauge symmetry, minima | ~t| = t0 describe s32 vacuum manifold. moduli space connected, therefore support topologically stable kink. situation reminiscent unstable type ii d-branes discussed section 3.3. case s1, result kink solution one unstable direction, resulting d-brane ended one tachyonic mode. present case 32 unstable directions resulting d8-brane 32 tachyonic modes world volume. course, modes one discovers quantizing d8 d9 open strings. case unstable type ii d-branes, associated conserved charge, appear k-theory analysis. type d8-brane, hand, appear k-theory analysis, even though analogous instability. witten argued support d8-brane follows: d-instanton implies two distinct type vacua distinguished sign d-instanton amplitude. z2 analog angle qcd. one expect domain wall connecting two vacua d8-brane. sign change instanton amplitude means d-instanton electromagnetic dual d8-brane. investigated gukov {$9805170$}. even though d8-brane unstable one could imagine forming moment time asking vacua two sides distinguished. recalling d-instanton responsible breaking o(32) so(32), seems clear vacua distinguished gauge-group reection. implies opposite spinor conjugacy classes would enter spin(32)/z2 gauge group two sides. course, d8-brane decays, vacuum becomes uniform everywhere. 7 concluding remarks considerable progress analyzing non-supersymmetric d-brane congura- tions. particular, stable non-bps d-branes identied, studied perturbative limits mathematical control. however, without bps property possible (at present) make quantitative studies away weak coupling. 34 another signicant development identication k-theory groups appropriate mathematical objects classifying d-brane charges. case bps d- branes, charges sources rr gauge elds, whereas non-bps cases not. non-bps d-branes discussed carry conserved z2 charges. however, sen analyzed examples charge groups (such z) also appear. one lesson learned k-theory take account spacetime lling d-branes, 32 d9-branes type theory. presence destabilize d-branes certain cases. acknowledgments grateful oren bergman, ashoke sen, edward witten helpful discussions suggestions. work supported part u.s. dept. energy grant no. de-fg03-92-er40701.
