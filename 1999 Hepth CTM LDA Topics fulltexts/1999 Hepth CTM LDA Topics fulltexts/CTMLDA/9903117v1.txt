compactication of matrix model on a noncommutative torus is obtained from strings ending on
d-branes with background b eld. the bps spectrum of the system and a novel sl(2, z) symmetry
are discussed.

noncommutativity of space-time coordinates emerged in string theory recently in the context of coincident d-
branes [1]; in fact the embedding coordinates of d-branes turned out to be noncommutative. these noncommutative
coordinates in the case of 0-branes are elevated to the dynamical variables of matrix theory, which is conjectured to
describe the strong coupling limit of string theory, or m-theory, in the innite momentum frame [2].

another kind of noncommutativity in spce coordinates has been recently observed in matrix theory which is
supercially dierent from the above kind. it comes from the application of the non-commutative geometry (ncg)
techniques pioneered by a. connes to the matrix theory compactications [3].

as a formulation of m-theory, matrix theory must describe string theory when compactied on a circle; further
compactications being neccessary to accomodate low energy physics. a class of toroidal compactications have been
known , which relies on a certain commutative subalgebra of matrices [4,5]. the subalgebra being an equivalent
description of the manifold of torus on which compactication is performed.

it was observed by connes, douglas and schwarz (cds) that a nonabelian generalization of this algebraic description
of the manifold of compactication, in the spirit of ncg, it is possible to arrive at a dierent compactication of
matrix-model, with the subsequent novel physical result of appearance of a constant background of the 3-form eld
in the 11 dimensional supergravity limit.

it was immediately observed by douglas and hull [6] that a consequent deformed sym theory and, therefore indi-
rectly, the noncommutative torus (nct) compactication is a natural consequence of certain d-brane congurations
in string theory. the subject has been pursued in recent works [7,8,9,10,11].

thus there is a close connection between constant background kalb-ramond eld b and the nonabelian torus
compactication of the matrix theory. but, it is not obvious how a background b eld can make the coordinates
noncommutative and how this noncommutativity diers from that of the coincident d-branes.

we will show explicitly how the cds noncommutativity arises from d-branes in the presence of b eld backgraound
and compare it with the noncommutativity due to coincident d-branes [12,13,21]. this noncommutativity persists in
higher tori. the dynamical variables of marix theory are n  n matrices which are function of time, with n going
to innity and with the supersymmetric action,

i =

(1)

x a, a = 1, ..., 9 are bosonic hermitian matrices and  are 16 component spinors. a are so(9) dirac matrices. classical
time independent solutions have commuting x a, therefore simultaneously diagonalizable, corresponding to the classical
coordinates of n 0-branes. in general o-diagonal elements of x a correspond to substringy noncommutative structure
of m-theory.

compactication of coordinates xi of matrix theory on a space-like torus of radii ri has been shown [5] to require

existence of the matrices ui with the property

uixiu 1

i = xi + ri

u x au 1 = x a

u u 1 = 

a 6= 1, 2

consistency between these equations requires:

uiuj = eiijujui,

(2)

(3)

for real numbers ij; where for the usual commutative torus, ij = 0. in fact rational ij will also give a commutative
torus. it is easily seen that for  = 0,

xi = i 
i

+ ai

, i = 1, ..., p

ui = eiiri .

(4)

is a solution of eq. (2) and (3) and its insertion in the action results in the p+1 dimensional sym on the dual torus.
here i parameterize the dual torus.

in the case of two torus, connes, douglas and schwarz [3] observed that in eq. (3),  can be taken dierent from
zero and it corresponds to compactication on a noncommutative torus (nct) and the resulting gauge theory is the
sym with the commutator of the gauge elds replaced by the moyal bracket. in ncg the c algebra of functions
over the manifold, is generalized to a noncommutative c algebra [14]. thus, the algebra generated by the commuting
matrices u1 and u2 in the case of usual t 2, is generalized to the algebra generated by u1 and u2 satisfying the relation
(3), which now denes a noncommutative torus, t 2

 . the solutions of (3) are then,

where ai now are functions of ui, with ui satisfying

xi = irii + ai,

u1 u2 = ei u2 u1,
[i, uj] = iij uj;

ui uj = ujui
i, j = 1, 2.

(6)

substituting them in the action, we get the sym theory on the nct dual to the original one, with the essential
modication being, the replacement of commutators of gauge elds by the moyal bracket,

a  b() = ei( 

(cid:8)a, b(cid:9) = a  b  b  a,

with  = (1, 2).

the bps spectrum of the compactied matrix theory on the noncommutative torus has been calculated[3,15], and

is,

e = r

nm(cid:26) 1

(cid:1)2

+ v 2

(8)

where v = (2)2r1r2 and ni
are kk momenta conjugate to xi; mi = ijmj, with mi winding number of the
ri
longitudinal membrane along xi and x direction; r the compactication radius along the x direction and wi are
the momenta of bps states due to the transverse coordinates and are constrained by:

n is the dimension of matrices, m is the winding number of the membrane around torus and  is the deformation
parameter of the torus. the mass spectrum (8) is invariant under an sl(2, z)n generated by

wi = ij(nmj  mnj).

(11)

this invariance is to be expected on the basis of the ncg considerations. it is the sl(2,z) invariance of the c-algebra
dening the nct [3].

we will now see how the above noncommutativit appears in string theory in the presence of d-branes in the b
background. the dynamics of strings ending on a p-brane in the background of the antisymmetric eld, b is [15],

s = 1

4 r d2(cid:2) ax bx gab + abbax bx  + 1

2 h d ai i,

where ai, i = 0, 1, p is the u (1) gauge eld living on the d-brane and i its internal coordinates. the action is
invariant under the combined gauge transformation [1]

a  a  .

the gauge invariant eld strength is then

f = b  f
which leads to the following mixed boundary conditions,

, f = [a].

x0 = 0

xi + fij xj = 0
xi  fij xj = 0
 xa = 0

, a = p, ..., 9.




canonical commutation relations of xi and their conjugate momenta pi, i = 1, ..., p:

pi =  xi  fijxj

,

[x (,  ), p  (,  )] = i (  ).

lead to the noncommutative center of mass coordinates:

xi =

1

 z x i(,  ) d,

[xi, xj] = ifij.

this noncommutativity of space coordinates is the reason for the noncommutativity which appears in the compact-
ication of matrix theory on a torus with a constant 3-form eld, which can be seen by going to the string matrix
model [16]. to see the connection between the noncommutativity due to the boundary conditions on the d-branes and
the noncommutativity which appears in the transverse coordinates of coincident d-branes, recall that d2-branes with
a non-zero u(1) gauge eld in the background contain a distribution of 0-branes proportional to f [12,13,17,18,19];
thus the noncommutativity of the coordinates.

it is interesting that the mechanism which produces the original noncommutativity in the description of d-branes,
and leads through a set of arguments to the particular form of the commutation relation in (19), is simply derived
from the string action (12) in the presence of the f and mixed boundary conditions with b eld background.

we compactify the x i direction and wrap the 2-brane around the 2-torus and use the center of mass coordinates
xi and their conjugate momenta to construct the generators of the c algebra of the noncommutative torus; proving
that the compactication, in the presence of u (1) eld strength, for d-membrane requires a nct;

1 = x1 + r1
2 = x2 + r2

u1x1u 1
u2x2u 1
i = xj

uixju 1

i 6= j = 1, 2

a solution to these equations is:

with a2 = 1 + 2f 2
r1r2

u1 = exp{ir1(cid:2)a(p1  x2
u2 = exp{ir2(cid:2)a(p2 + x1

f )  x2
f(cid:3)}
f ) + x1
f (cid:3)},

. the above relations leads to

u1u2 = eif u2u1.

(20)

(21)

(22)

this result reproduces the matrix theory compactication on the nct formulated by cds, described previously.
it was argued there that, the noncommutativity of the torus is related to the non-vanishing of 3-form of m-theory,
which in the string theory reduces to the antisymmetric nsns 2-form eld, b. in our case noncommutativity of
the torus on which the d-membrane of string theory is compactied, is a direct result of the non-vanishing b eld.
in fact using the matrix model formulation of string theory [16]. it is straightforward to obtain cds results.

the noncommutativity of the c algebra (20) and (3) of the nct is similar to, but distinct from, the noncom-
mutativity of the coordinates as in (19) and as it appears in matrix theory and bound states of d-branes. the
similarities are obvious, but the dierences are subtle. in fact it is possible to see that when f is quantized to a
rational number, by an sl(2,z) transformation, we can make the u1 and u2 commute, i.e. we can make the torus
commutative, while the coordinates are noncommutative. thus for irrational parameter , we are dealing with a new
form of noncommutativity not encountered in ordinary matrix theory or in the context of d-brane bound state.

we will now nd the bps spectrum of a system of (d2-d0)-brane bound state. it is convenient to consider the
t-dual version of the mixed brane, in which we only need to deal with commutative coordinates and commutative
torus, and are able to calculate the related spectrum just by theusual string theory methods.

applying t-duality in an arbitrary direction, say x 2,

x 0 = 0

(x 1 + f x 2) = 0
 (x 2  f x 1) = 0

 x a = 0

, a = 3, ..., 9,

(23)




describing a tilted d-string which makes an angle  with the duality direction, x 2:

thus we consider a d-string winding around a cycle of a torus dened by:

cot  = f .

 =

r2
r1

ei = 1 + i2

,

 = ir1r2 sin  + b = i2 + b,

(24)

where b = br1r2 sin  is the ux of the b eld on the torus. the d-string is located at an angle  with the r1
direction such that it winds n times around r1 and m times around r2. hence

cot  =

n

m2

+ cot .

(25)

the bps spectrum of this tilted d-string system gets contributions from both the open strings attached to the

d-string and the d-string itself. the open strings have mode expansions [16]:

x i = xi

0 + pi + li + oscil.
x 0 = x0

0 + p0 + oscil.

, i = 1, 2

x a = xa

0 + oscil.

, a = 3, ..., 9

where pi and li, in usual complex notation, are:

p = r1

l = q1

n + m

|n + m|2r 2
|n + m|2 r 2

(n + m )

; r1  z.

; q1  z.

mass of the open string is then,

m 2 = |p + l|2 + n =

2

|n + m|2 |r1 + q1|2

(27)

(28)

(29)

+ n ,

where n is the contribution of the oscillatory modes. this mass is invariant under both sl(2, z)s of the torus acting
on  and  . applying t-duality in r1 direction,

we obtain the spectrum of the open string compactied on nct,

or equivalently   ,

m 2 =

next we consider the d-string contribution. for this purpose we use the dbi action [9,20],

with

sdstring = 1

ab = (cid:18) 1  v2

the sl(2, z)n invariance, acting on , is manifestly seen from the above equation. the open strings and the d-string
form a marginal bound state, and the full bps spectrum is the addition of the separate contributins,
