abstract

we consider the entropy of a black hole which has zero area horizon. the microstates
appear as monopole solutions of the eective theory on the corresponding brane cong-
urations. the resulting entropy formula coincides with the one expected from stringy
calculation and agrees with u-duality invariance of entropy.

1. introduction

black holes have been found to be good objects to examine the power of string theory.
the entropy of a 5 dimensional extremal black hole was derived by using the d-brane
description [1][2].
it agrees with bekenstein-hawking entropy [3] calculated from the
corresponding black hole solution in supergravity [4]. it was also argued that such d-
brane description could apply to non-extremal black holes and their hawking radiation
etc was discussed [2]. this technology was applied to 4 dimensional black holes, and the
entropy formula was derived for extremal cases [5][6].

it is known that 4 dimensional extremal black holes need to have 4 charges to have
nite area horizon. for example, compactifying d1-d5 system considered in [2] on s1
provides a 4 dimensional black hole, but its horizon area is found to be zero. this seems
to indicate that the entropy is zero. however, the method to count microstates used in
[2] is independent of whether spatial directions are compactied or not, and one expects
that the same entropy formula should be derived after compactication. this point was
argued in [5] as follows. in the corresponding supergravity solution, dilaton eld diverges
at the horizon. therefore this solution may receive large quantum correction and this
provides the entropy expected from stringy calculation.

the situation must be the same in a black hole which is composed of d0-branes and
intersecting d4-branes, related by u-duality to the compactied d1-d5 system mentioned
above. the corresponding supergravity solution indeed has zero area horizon and dilaton
divergence at the horizon. because of u-duality invariance of entropy, it is expected
that there exist microstates which provide the entropy. such microstates was discussed
recently in [7], but their existence was not proved.

in this paper we will nd out such microstates by constructing the low energy eective
theory at the d4-d4 intersection. in this theory d0-branes will appear as monopoles, just
like the d4-d0 case in which d0-branes appear as instantons [8]. then the entropy can be
derived by counting the monopole ground states which preserve a half of supersymmetries.
this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we summarize the classical aspects
of the black hole considered above. in section 3 we construct the eective theory at the
d4-d4 intersection. its monopole solutions are discussed in section 4, and the entropy
formula is derived in section 5. section 6 is devoted to conclusion and discussion. the
properties of the monopole solutions are summarized in appendix.

2. black hole solution and entropy

the conguration of the d4-d0 system we will discuss is as follows. consider type
iia theory compactied on t 6. there are q1 d4-branes wrapping, say, along (4567)
directions of t 6, and q2 d4-branes wrapping along (6789) directions (we will denote this
as d4-branes). d4-branes and d4-branes intersect at a 2-brane. in addition, there are
n d0-branes at the intersection. the corresponding solution of type iia supergravity
is known [4].
it can be obtained from the solution of 11 dimensional supergravity by
dimensional reduction [9].

this solution has zero area horizon, and its bekenstein-hawking entropy is zero.

however, it can be shown that the above brane conguration is related by u-duality
to the d1-d5 system compactied on s1. the method of counting microstates used in
[2] does not depend on whether the spatial directions are compactied or not, and this
suggests that the same entropy formula is valid when compactied on s1. because of
u-duality invariance of entropy, it is natural to expect that the entropy of d4-d4-d0
system is, at quantum level,

s = 2qq1q2n.

(3)

this is implied by the classical solution (2). one can see that the dilaton eld diverges at
the horizon, indicating that entropy may receive large quantum corrections. this point
was argued in [5] by the dimensional arguments. in the following sections, we will look
for the corresponding microstates in d4-d4-d0 system which contribute to the entropy.

3. eective theory on the intersection
low energy eective theory on the d4-d4 intersection is (2+1) dimensional n = 4
super yang-mills theory with matters.
its matter contents can be derived from string
perturbation theory. consider an open string attached to the d4-branes. the massless
states which come from the string on d4-branes form an n = 1 vector multiplet in 10
dimensions. this is an n = 4 vector multiplet and adjoint hypermultiplet in 3 dimen-
sions. there are similar multiplets coming from d4-branes. the gauge group is therefore
u(q1) u(q2). the massless states which come from the two strings stretching between
d4 and d4 form an n = 4 hypermultiplet in the representation (q1, q2) for the gauge
group.
in this paper we will
consider the simplest case, q1 = q2 = 1. in this case, adjoint hypermultiplets decouple
from the dynamics. moreover, one of a linear combination of the vector multiplets also
decouple and the eective theory is just n = 4 super qed with one fundamental hy-
permultiplet. it is convenient to obtain the action from 4 dimensional n = 2 theory by
dimensional reduction.

the action is almost entirely determined by supersymmetry.

the bosonic part of the action is

the eective theory should be parity invariant. the parity transformation exchanges
x1 and x2, and reverses orientation of both d4-brane and d4-brane. but physically this
makes no dierence. therefore we will not include in the action parity-violating terms
such as chern-simons term.

4. bps monopole solutions

in the eective theory constructed above d0-branes will appear as bps monopoles
preserving half of supersymmetries, as they appear in d4-brane eective theory as instan-
tons [8]. from supersymmetry transformations (5), one can show that the static solutions
which preserve half of supersymmetries fall into two cases. the rst one is

f12 = g2|q|2, d1q  id2q = 0

q = m = 0

when the grassmann parameters satisfy

the second one is

(0 + ) = (0  ) = 0.

f12 = g2|q|2, d1 q + id2 q = 0

q = m = 0

[10]. now we perform an analytic continuation such as

unfortunately, it is shown that these equations have no physically acceptable solution

then the equations (6)(8) become

xa  ixa, aa  iaa

(a = 1, 2).

or,

f12 = g2|q|2, d1q + id2q = 0

f12 = g2|q|2, d1 q  id2 q = 0.

(11)

(12)

the monopole solutions of (11)(12) have been constructed explicitly in [10] and we sum-
marize these properties in appendix. we will discuss  = +1 case below.  = 1 case
corresponds to the anti d0-branes at the intersection.
the one-monopole solution to eqs.(11)(12) is characterized by a positive integer
(monopole charge) and 3 real parameters (its position and scale). when we consider
the superposition of monopoles, one more real parameter is needed for each monopole to
parametrize the general solutions. thus we conclude that the one-monopole solution has
4 real parameters. its moduli space is therefore r2 c. in the situation we are discussing
in relation to the black hole, the topology of the intersection is t 2. then the moduli space
in this case will be, after suitable compactication,

m1 = t 2  s2

(13)

the dynamics of the monopole is described by a supersymmetric quantum mechanics
whose target space is m1. its ground states correspond to the cohomology classes of m1.
the number of ground states can be determined as follows.

(number of bosonic states) =

(number of fermionic states) =

xk=0

dim(h 2k(m1)) = 4

dim(h 2k+1(m1)) = 4

(14)

(15)

5. ground state counting and entropy

now we can derive the entropy formula by counting the ground states of monopoles.
consider the general case (q1, q2 > 1). each d4-brane is supposed to be separated from
the other d4-branes (the same is true for the d4-branes), and there are q1q2 d4-d4
intersections. assume that the dominant contribution to the entropy comes from the
monopole states described in section 4 which are at the intersections. total monopole

5

charge of these states correspond to d0-brane charge n. recalling that each monopole
has 4 bosonic ground states and 4 fermionic ones, one can see that counting these states
is equivalent to counting the degeneracy of states at level n in free cft of 4q1q2 bosons
and 4q1q2 fermions.

the equivalence between the partitions of d0-branes into their ground states and the
states in the cft can be shown by the following one-to-one correspondence. the partition
of d0-branes is characterized by a set of integers,

{nb(k, i, q), nf (k, i, q)},
k = 1, 2,   ,

xq=1
xk=1

xi=1

q1q2

4

i = 1, 2, 3, 4, q = 1, 2,   , q1q2

(knb(k, i, q) + knf (k, i, q)) = n

(16)

where nb(k, i, q) is the occupation number of the i-th bosonic state of the monopole with
magnetic charge k at the q-th intersection and nf (k, i, q) is the one of the fermionic
state. this corresponds to the following state.



yk=1
xk=1

yi=1
xi=1

q1q2

yq=1
xq=1

((i,q)

k )nb (k,i,q)((i,q)

k )nf (k,i,q)|0 >

(17)

(knb(k, i, q) + knf (k, i, q)) = n

thus the generating function of the number of such partitions coincides to the partition
function of the free cft.

z =



yn=1

(1 + qn)4q1q2
(1  qn)4q1q2

=



xn=0

d(n)qn

(18)

this formula is rederived from the consideration of the cohomology of multi-monopole
moduli space. first we consider only one intersection. since the monopole states are bps
states, the multi-monopole moduli space will be a symmetric product space.

mn = (m1)n /sn  snm1

(19)

the dimension of the cohomology of such space can be determined from the following
formula [12],

where d = dimx and bk(x) is betti number of x. let x = m1 and y = 1, we obtain,

(1  (1)kqn)(1)k bk(m1)



4

yk=0
(1 + qn)4
(1  qn)4
d(n)qn

thus we conclude that the number of ground states of n d0-branes is

4n

xk=0

dim(h k(mn )) = d(n)

(21)

(22)

then let us return to the general q1, q2 case. the generating function of the number of
ground states is just a product of eq.(21).

z =   
yn=1

(1 + qn)4

(1  qn)4!q1q2

this coincides to eq.(18).

the entropy of this system is logarithm of d(n), and thus

s = 2qq1q2n

(23)

(24)

for large n. eq.(24) coincides with the entropy derived from d1-d5 system by stringy
calculation, and agrees with the u-duality invariance of the entropy.

as mentioned in section 2, from the classical geometry the entropy should be zero.
but this is not a contradiction. in the monopole solution, the existence of the hypermul-
tiplet scalars q, q is very important. they come from an open string stretching between
intersecting d4-d4. the appearance of this string is regarded as the resolution of the
classical singularity.

6. conclusion and discussion

we have discussed entropy of the 4 dimensional black hole composed of d0-branes
and the intersecting d4-branes. from the classical geometry, this black hole has zero
area horizon, and its entropy seems to be zero. we constructed low energy eective
theory at the d4-d4 intersection and found d0-brane bound states which appeared as
monopoles. by the explicit monopole solutions, it is shown that the monopole has 4 real
parameters and its moduli space is t 2  s2. then we have concluded that the monopole
has 4 bosonic ground states and 4 fermionic ones. from these results, we have derived
the entropy formula. this agrees with the formula for d1-d5 system, which is u-dual of
our black hole.

7

the emergence of the entropy is expected already from the classical black hole solu-
tion. the dilaton diverges at the horizon, signaling the large quantum correction. the
resolution of the singularity is due to the existence of the hypermultiplet scalars q, q,
which comes from open string stretching between the intersecting d4-branes.

one subtle point in our argument is the necessity of analytic continuation. without
this, there is no state preserving a half of supersymmetries. a similar problem exists in
d4-d0 bound states. it is well known that u(1) gauge eld, which corresponds to one
d4-brane case, cannot have instanton solution. the monopole solution discussed in this
paper may be related to this situation and, therefore, the problem will not exist when
q1, q2 > 1. it is interesting to extend our argument to the non-abelian case.

appendix: monopole solutions

in this appendix, we will discuss the following equations.

f12 = g2|q|2
d1q + id2q = 0

(25)
(26)

the solutions were constructed explicitly in [10]. here we will solve (25)(26) and summa-
rize the properties of the solutions.

(25)(26) can be solved as follows. since q is a complex scalar, it can be written as

q =

where  and  are real functions. substituting (27) into (26), gauge elds aa are shown
to be written as

aa =

where ab is antisymmetric and 12 = +1. from (25), one obtains the liouville equation

first we consider the radially symmetric solutions. the general solutions are known.

(r) =

(30)

n, r0 are integration constants. regularity at origin and innity requires n  1. to avoid
singularity in aa at origin,  should be (n  1). then n must be an integer to make q
single-valued. thus we conclude that the radially symmetric solutions are

the monopole charge m can be easily calculated.

it is related to d0-brane charge n as n = m

f (z) =

where ck, zk are complex parameters. total monopole charge of this solution is m = 4n.
zk is position of the k-th monopole and ck is related to its size. thus this solution depends
on 4n real parameters, and this means that each monopole has 4 real parameters.
