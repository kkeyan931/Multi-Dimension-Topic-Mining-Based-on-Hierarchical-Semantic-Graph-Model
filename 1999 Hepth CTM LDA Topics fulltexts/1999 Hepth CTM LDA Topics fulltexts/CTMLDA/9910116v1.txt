the n=4 gauged su(2)su(1,1) supergravity in four-dimensional euclidean
space is obtained via a consistent dimensional reduction of the n=1, d=10
supergravity on s3  ads3. the dilaton potential in the theory is propor-
tional to the dierence of the two gauge coupling constants, which is due to
the opposite signs of the curvatures of s3 and ads3. as a result, the potential
can be positive, negative, or zero  depending on the values of the constants.
a consistent reduction of the fermion supersymmetry transformations is per-
formed at the linearized level, and special attention is paid to the euclidean
majorana condition. a further reduction of the d=4 theory is considered
to the static, purely magnetic sector, where the vacuum solutions are stud-
ied. the bogomolnyi equations are derived and their essentially non-abelian
monopole-type and sphaleron-type solutions are presented. any solution in
the theory can be uplifted to become a vacuum of string or m-theory.

1 introduction

supergravity backgrounds play an important role in the analysis of string
theory. besides genuine fully supersymmetric string vacua, also solutions
with partial supersymmetry (p-branes, monopoles etc. [1]) are presently ob-
taining much consideration, in particular in view of their role in verifying
various duality conjectures. unfortunately, apart from stringy monopoles [2]
and related solutions [1] obtained via the heterotic ve-brane construction
[3] (see also [4, 5]), most of the literature is devoted to solutions with abelian
gauge elds. this is easily understood, since such congurations can often
be obtained from the known solutions of the einstein-maxwell system, while
the non-abelian sector is much more dicult to study. on the other hand,
it is to be expected that also congurations with non-abelian gauge elds
will eventually play an important role. apart from this, gauged supergravity
models obtainable from string or m-theory via the kaluza-klein reduction
have recently regained considerable interest in view of the ads/cft corre-
spondence; see for example [6, 7, 8]. this also suggests studying classical
solutions of supergravities with non-abelian gauge elds. finally, systems
with gravitating yang-mills elds can be studied in the context of general
relativity, where they have recently attracted a lot of attention in view of
the unusual properties of their solutions [9]. unfortunately, due to the high
complexity of the equations, our knowledge is largely based on numerical
analysis. at the same time, gauged supergravities provide the rare opportu-
nity to obtain analytical solutions via solving the bogomolnyi equations.

the present work was motivated by the desire to analytically obtain cer-
tain particle-like solutions for gravitating yang-mills elds, which requires
to identify the corresponding gauged supergravity model. in the recent work
[10, 11] non-abelian partially supersymmetric vacua were obtained within the
n=4 gauged su(2)su(2) supergravity, also known as freedmanschwarz
(fs) model [12]. these solutions are globally regular, but not asymptotically
at  due to the presence of the dilaton potential,

u() = 

1
8

(g2

(1) + g2

(2)) e2 ,

(1.1)

where g(1) and g(2) are the gauge coupling constants. it is well-known that
a dilaton potential unbounded from below is generically present in gauged
supergravities (see, however, ref.[13]). the potential renders solutions non-

1

asymptotically at, and it is therefore necessary to get rid of it if one wants
to obtain particle-like solutions. for this purpose the following trick was
employed in [14]: to truncate the fs model to the purely magnetic sector
and then to pass to imaginary values of the gauge coupling constant g(2):

g(2)  ig(2).

(1.2)
for |g(2)| = g(1) the potential vanishes. surprisingly, such a formal trick
does not destroy supersymmetry  the replacement (1.2) in the fs fermion
supersymmetry transformations leads to non-trivial bogomolnyi equations.
these admit asymptotically at solutions. as the existence of bogomolnyi
equations is usually related to supersymmetry, it was conjectured in [14]
that there is another, hitherto unknown consistent gauged supergravity that
can be formally related to the fs model via the replacement (1.2). the
justication of this conjecture is the main subject of the present paper.

to understand what the new supergravity is, let us remember that the
fs model can be obtained via dimensional reduction of the n=1, d=10
supergravity on the group manifold su(2)su(2) [11]. now, the replacement
(1.2) suggests considering another reduction of the same theory: on the group
manifold su(2)su(1,1). since su(1,1) is non-compact and its invariant
metric is non-positive denite, the timelike coordinate of the ten-dimensional
space should be viewed as one of the internal coordinates. specically, in
order to match the metric signature in ten dimensions, one chooses a positive
cartan metric for the su(2) factor and a negative one for the su(1,1) factor.
the geometry on the internal six-space is then described by the standard
metric on s3  ads3 with the signature (+ + + + +), while the remaining
four-space becomes euclidean.
the fs dilaton potential (1.1) arises upon reduction as the contribution
of the scalar curvatures of the internal manifolds (and also due to the d=10
three-form). since the scalar curvatures for the two s3 factors are positive,
the radii of the spheres being 1/g(1) and 1/g(2), the result is proportional to
the sum g2
(2). now, in the case of the reduction on s3 ads3 the scalar
curvatures for these two factors have dierent signs. as a result, choosing
again 1/g(1) and 1/g(2) to be the (real) radii of the internal manifolds, the
dilaton potential of the resulting euclidean theory is proportional to the
dierence g2

(1) + g2

(1)  g2
(2).

to summarize, the new theory appears to be an n=4 gauged supergravity
in four-dimensional euclidean space. we call it euclidean freedman-schwarz

2

(efs) model.
its matter content is similar to the one of the fs model,
but the gauge group is now su(2)su(1,1). the dilaton potential can be
positive, negative or zero  depending on the values of the two gauge cou-
pling constants. this allows one to study various supersymmetric solutions
for gravitating yang-mills elds by integrating the rst order bogomolnyi
equations.

the above qualitative considerations will be conrmed by detailed cal-
culations. in sec.2 we describe the dimensional reduction procedure in the
bosonic sector. we use the general recipes for the reduction on group mani-
folds given in [15] and, in order to keep control over the calculations at every
step, consider the reductions on s3  ads3 and s3  s3 simultaneously.
specically, our dimensional reduction ansatz and most of other formulas
contain a selective parameter, s. the value s = 1 corresponds to the reduc-
tion on s3  ads3, while for s = 1 we recover the results of the analysis
for the s3  s3 case described in [11]. since we are interested in obtaining
a specic rather than the most general four-dimensional model, we truncate
many of the degrees of freedom and always work at the level of equations of
motion in order to maintain consistency. the main result of sec.2 is that a
consistent reduction on s3  ads3 is possible and the equations of motion of
the resulting theory in d=4 can be obtained by varying the lagrangian in
eq. (2.30). if a four-dimensional conguration fullls these equations then
its uplifted ten-dimensional version will be on shell.

in sec.3 we consider the reduction of the d=10 linearized fermion su-
persymmetry transformations down to d=4. after discussing the euclidean
majorana condition we derive the four-dimensional supersymmetry variations
in eqs. (3.27), (3.36). if these variations vanish for a given four-dimensional
conguration, then its uplifted version will be supersymmetric in the ten-
dimensional sense. this completes the dimensional reduction procedure, as
we obtain the bosonic lagrangian and the fermion supersymmetry transfor-
mations, which is sucient for deriving the bogomolnyi equations.

in sec.4 we apply our results in order to obtain supersymmetric vacua
with gravitating yang-mills elds by deriving and integrating the bogo-
molnyi equations. first, we consider a further truncation of the theory to
the static, purely magnetic sector. it turns out that, in this sector, the eld
equations and supersymmetry transformations for the fs and efs models
are formally related via the analytic continuation (1.2). this provides a
complete explanation of the conjecture of ref.[14]. we then impose a spher-

3

ical symmetry and derive the supersymmetry constraints, whose consistency
conditions give us a system of rst order non-linear bogomolnyi equations.
essentially non-abelian solutions of these equations are known in two spe-
cial cases [10, 11, 14]. for g(1)
6= 0, g(2) = 0 the solution preserves 1/4
of the supersymmetries and turns out to be of regular monopole type. for
g(1) = g(2) 6= 0 the solution is of sphaleron type and has only 1/8 of the
supersymmetries unbroken.
the last section contains some concluding remarks. we use units where

h = c = 4g = 1.

our notation is as follows. the hatted symbols are reserved for d=10 quan-
tities. we shall always use late letters for base space indices and early ones
for tangent space indices. indices in ten, four, and six dimensions are de-
noted by capital latin, small greek, and small latin letters, respectively,
such that m  ( = 0, . . . , 3; m = 1, . . . , 6) is the base space index, and
a  ( = 0, . . . , 3; a = 1, . . . , 6) is the tangent space index. the space-
time coordinates are xm  (x, zm). we shall sometimes be considering
the further split of the four-indices into 3+1 as   (0, k) and   (0, a)
with the three-indices denoted by bold-faced letters. the 6space will be as-
sumed to be a direct product of two three-dimensional group spaces labeled
by () = 1, 2 with the indices for each of the internal three-spaces denoted by
italic letters. as a result, every 6-index will be replaced by a pair of indices

here the parameter s assumes two values: s = 1 or s = i = 1. the two

options correspond to the same theory in d=10  up to a renumbering of
coordinates  but to two dierent choices of the four-space. for s = i the
time coordinate in d=10 is x0 and the four-metric is lorentzian. for s = 1
the time is x9, which is regarded as one of the internal coordinates, and the
four-space is euclidean.

assume also that zm span a semi-simple (and not necessarily compact) group
space g, and that a are the invariant forms. the vectors ea dual to a satisfy
the commutation relations

here g(1)=su(2), while there are two options for the second factor in the
product, g(2)  g(2)
s =su(2) for
s = i. the direct product structure implies that the invariant group metric,
structure constants, etc., decompose into direct sums. for example,

with g(1) and g(2) being real constants. as a result, we can replace the

expense of adding the index () = 1, 2. for example, we shall often write
()

2.2 four-dimensional theory
we now have the complete ansatz for gm n , hm n p and , and this we insert
into the supergravity equations (2.2)(2.4). let us consider rst eq. (2.2)
for the dilaton . using the above denitions, it is not dicult to see that
this equation assumes the following four-dimensional form:

(2.24)

the next step is to check eq. (2.3) for hm n p . this is in fact a system of 49
equations labeled by pairs of indices (m, n), and it can be split into three

8

groups labeled by (, ), (a,b), and (,a), respectively. a direct computation
then reveals that the (, ) and (a,b) equations are identically fullled, while
the (,a) ones reduce to

 f ()c = 2 f ()aa .

these are the four-dimensional yang-mills equations; the dual tensor is de-
ned as f ()a
let us now turn to the einstein equations in (2.4). splitting these into
the (, ), (a,b) and (,a) groups and using the expressions for rm n in (2.21)
together with all the above denitions, we nd that the (a,b) equations are
identically fullled, while the (,a) ones again reduce to the yang-mills equa-
tions (2.25). the (, ) group gives the four-dimensional einstein equations:

r = 2    2s2e4a  a + 2 t + 2u() g ,

(2.27)

at this point our procedure successfully terminates, since all ten-dimensional
equations are now fullled, provided that the four-dimensional dilaton, yang-
mills, and einstein equations in (2.23)(2.27) hold. we note, however, that
so far we have not obtained the equation for the axion a. this arises as
the consistency condition for the einstein equations (2.26). specically, the
bianchi identities for (2.26) are fullled by virtue of the dilaton and yang-

we have therefore obtained a four-dimensional theory via the consistent
dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional supergravity.
in fact, we have
obtained two dierent theories distinguished by the values of the param-
eter s = 1, i. let us recall that the signature of the spacetime metric
is (s2, +1, +1, +1), the internal metrics are (2)
ab = diag(+1, +1,s2) and
(1)
ab = ab, and the eld tensors f ()a
the model (2.30) describes interacting gravitational, axion, dilaton, and
two non-abelian gauge elds with gauge group g and two independent gauge
coupling constants g(1) and g(2). for s = i the gauge group is su(2)su(2),
and the theory coincides with the bosonic sector of the gauged supergravity
of freedman and schwarz [12]. we have therefore reproduced the result of
ref.[11] that the freedman-schwarz model can be obtained via dimensional
reduction of d=10, n=1 supergravity on s3  s3. the inverse radii of the
spheres determine the gauge coupling constants g().
the principal new result that we obtain here is the model determined by
(2.30) for s = 1. this has been hitherto unknown. it is somewhat similar to
the freedman-schwarz model, apart from the fact that it lives in euclidean
and not lorentzian space, also the gauge group is now su(2)su(1,1), and
the dilaton potential is proportional to the dierence and not to the sum of
the coupling constants. the latter is due to the opposite signs of the scalar
curvatures of the group manifolds used for the dimensional reduction: su(2)
with the positive metric and su(1,1) with the negative metric.

we call the new theory euclidean freedman-schwarz (efs) model. some
of its features are as follows. we notice that the kinetic terms for the dilaton
and axion in (2.30) have opposite signs, which is typical for euclidean theo-
ries. we notice also that the non-compact lie-algebra components of f (2)a

(a = 1, 2) give positive contributions to the energy density, while the com-
pact one (a = 3) makes a negative contribution. this is because the metric
for bilinear combinations of the gauge eld strength is not the cartan metric
for su(1,1) but its negative, (2)
ab . so far the new supergravity is not yet

10

complete, since we have described only its bosonic sector. we shall now pass
to considering the fermions, in which we shall restrict ourselves to deriving
the linearized fermion supersymmetry transformations.

the fermion elds of d=10, n=1 supergravity, the gravitino m and the
gaugino , can be consistently set to zero, which leads to the action (2.1).

we shall now proceed as in the bosonic case to express the ten-dimensional
quantities in terms of the four-dimensional ones. our aim is to consistently
derive the four-dimensional supersymmetry transformations from the ten-
dimensional rules (3.1),(3.2). the vanishing of the four-dimensional susy
variations will then imply that the ten-dimensional variations  m and  
vanish.

3.2 the majorana-weyl condition
having expressed the as in terms of four-dimensional quantities, we need a
similar reduction also for the spinors. it is important that the spinors in eqs.
(3.1), (3.2) are majorana-weyl with  s and  being right handed, while
  is left-handed [16]. upon dimensional reduction the d=10 majorana-
weyl condition will reduce to majorana-type constraints for the d=4 spinors,
which we shall discuss in some detail, especially in the euclidean case.

let us rst consider the weyl condition. as is well-known, this can be
imposed in any even-dimensional space. in the particular case of d=10 one
denes the chirality matrix as

11 =  0 1 . . . 9 = 

2  5  1l4 ,

the weyl spinors  being solutions of

11

 =   .

(3.11)

(3.12)

let us now consider the majorana condition. this is dened by the matrix
b subject to

b a b1 = (cid:16)a(cid:17)

,

(3.13)

where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. such a matrix always exists,
since a  (a) is a symmetry of the cliord algebra. this implies that for
any spinor  in any dimension d and for an arbitrary spacetime signature
one can dene the conjugated spinor m  b1 , which transforms as .
what is not always possible is to choose b such that

b b = 1 .

as a result, the majorana condition, m = , or explicitly

 = b  ,

(3.14)

(3.15)

is not always consistent, since it requires that (3.14) must hold. for example,
for d=4 the solution to (3.13), (3.14) exists in minkowski space but not
in euclidean space.
in those cases where the majorana condition can be
imposed, it is not always compatible with the weyl condition, since chirality
may change under the majorana conjugation.

13

as is well-known, in ten-dimensional space with the signature (1,9) the
majorana condition can be imposed and is compatible with the weyl condi-
tion. let us see this explicitly. in the representation (3.4) one has

where

b =   a  b ,
0 s2 ! ,
 =   1
and the 4  4 matrices a and b are such that

0

(3.18)

representation of  and ()a. in the representation (3.9), (3.10) one has

aa  bb = 1l .
5. the explicit form of a and b depends on the

(3.19)

a = 1l2  2,
for s = 1, while for s = i one nds

b =  2   1

a = 2  2,

b =  2   2 .

(3.20)

(3.21)

using these denitions one can see that the weyl condition in (3.11),(3.12)
and the majorana condition in (3.15) can be solved simultaneously as

(3.22)



 = 

i5 ! ,
 = a  b  .

with

(3.23)
here  is written in the form of a two-component spinor which is acted
upon by the 2  2 bold-faced matrices like 1l2,  a and . the spinor 
has 16 components, which are acted upon by the 4  4 gamma-matrices 
and group-generators t()
a . one can write   i
, where i= 1, . . . 4 is the
group index and  = 1, . . . 4 is the spinor index.
in view of (3.23) only
8 components of  are independent. we notice that the condition (3.23) is

14

invariant under 4-rotations generated by 1
4[, ] and gauge transformations
generated by t()
a . as a result,  can be viewed as a g-group multiplet of
majorana spinors in d=4 with the majorana condition given by (3.23). eqs.
(3.22), (3.23) therefore provide the sought expression for the ten-dimensional
spinors in terms of the four-dimensional ones.

the majorana condition (3.23) is obtained for both values of the pa-
rameter s. one might think that for s = 1, when the space is euclidean,
this contradicts the well-known fact that there are no majorana spinors in
four-dimensional euclidean space. however, there is no contradiction, since
the spinors have internal degrees of freedom. specically, the normalization
(3.19), which is the analog of (3.14), holds because there are two factors on
the left hand side of (3.19), which satisfy

aa = s2,

bb = s2 .

(3.24)

for s = 1 each of the two terms here has the wrong sign, but two wrongs
make a right  their product in (3.19) has the correct sign. without the
matrix b one would be left with just one wrong sign, and this implies that
singlet fermions cannot be majorana. to recapitulate, the euclidean majo-
rana condition (3.23) is consistent due to the group degrees of freedom. we
also note that, since a5a1 = +(5) for s = 1, the majorana spinors can
be at the same time weyl.

for s = i each of the two factors in (3.19) has the correct sign on its
own. in particular, for s = i one can choose all the ()as to be real [12], in
which case b = 1. as a result, the majorana condition can be imposed both
for group singlets and multiplets. however, since a5a1 = (5), spinors
cannot at the same time be majorana and weyl.

3.3 four-dimensional susy variations

we now have all necessary tools in order to reduce the d=10 susy trans-
formations in (3.1), (3.2) to four dimensions. let us rst consider eq. (3.2)
for  . the spinors   and  have left and right chiralities, respectively, and
we therefore choose according to (3.22)

inserting this into (3.2), using the as from (3.4) and habc from (2.22),
and also utilizing the identity

eq. (3.2) reduces to the following relation between  and :

we note that this relation is compatible with the majorana condition (3.23)
for the spinors  and . specically, taking the majorana conjugate of (3.27)
and using (3.18), the whole expression reproduces itself.

consider now the equation for  m in (3.1). the procedure in this case
is somewhat more involved. the rst step is to compute the spinor covariant
derivatives in (3.3), and for this we need the spin-connection ab,m . this
can be obtained as

ab,c =

where ca,bc = adc d

using these expressions together with (3.4) and (2.22) we rst consider

internal coordinates, m=m. utilizing the identity

notice the following important fact: the expression on the right contains
the partial and not the covariant derivative. specically, when simplifying
the expression on the left the spin connection arises twice, and a careful
examination reveals that the two terms cancel each other. as a result, the
expression in (3.33) appears to be not covariant under local rotations of the
internal basis ea. this, however, is simply a consequence of the fact that the
whole theory under consideration does not allow for such rotations. indeed,
the crucial assumption is that the basis ea consists of invariant vector elds,
for which only global rotations are allowed. under these, obviously, eq.
(3.33) is covariant.

consider now the four-dimensional part of the gravitino,  . since  m

has positive chirality, we consider the linear combination [16, 11]

ab
(3.25), (3.27), (3.33), (3.34), and (3.36) provide
an equivalent representation of the ten-dimensional susy variations   and
 m , as no truncation of the fermionic degrees of freedom has been done so
far. let us now assume that the parameter  does not depend on the internal
coordinates


zm  = 0 .

(3.37)

this is consistent due to the appearance of the partial derivative in (3.33)
discussed above, and eventually due to the fact that the internal space is a
group manifold. in the case of dimensional reduction on general homogeneous
spaces the dependence of spinors on internal coordinates is usually more
complicated and is given in terms of killing spinors on the internal space
[17].

let us now suppose that  =  = 0. eq. (3.25) then implies that
  = 0, eq. (3.34) shows that   = 0, while eq. (3.33) ensures in view
of (3.37) that  m = 0. as a result, all components of the ten-dimensional
susy variations vanish,   =  m = 0. this shows that we can restrict our
considerations to the four-dimensional susy variations  and  given
by (3.27) and (3.36). the vanishing of these implies that the background
bosonic conguration is supersymmetric when lifted to ten dimensions.

we have completed our program of deriving the four-dimensional the-
ory from the ten-dimensional one. summarizing, in addition to the bosonic
lagrangian (2.30) we now have also the four-dimensional supersymmetry
transformations (3.27), (3.36). for s = i these exactly coincide with the
lagrangian and linearized susy variations of the freedman-schwarz model
described in [12], up to a change of the overall sign of the metric:

g  g,

  i,

  i,

5  5 .

(3.38)

(2.30), (3.27), (3.36) give us the lagrangian and susy
for s = 1 eqs.
variations of the euclidean freedman-schwarz model. this appears to be
the n=4 gauged su(2)su(1,1) supergravity in four-dimensional euclidean
space. here n=4 is due to the fact that the spinor supersymmetry parameter
 in (3.27), (3.36) is a multiplet of four majorana spinors.

having obtained the theory, we shall now proceed with studying its vac-
uum structure. since we have a gauged supergravity, we shall mainly be

18

interested in solutions with non-abelian gauge elds. in particular, we still
need to explain the relation g(2)  ig(2) between the two models, as this ap-
parently does not hold at the level of the full d=4 theories, which are rather
related via s  is.

4 vacua

a supersymmetric vacuum is an on-shell bosonic conguration which is in-
variant under some or all of the susy transformations. this manifests in
the existence of non-trivial spinor parameters  for which the fermion susy
variations vanish. such s are called supersymmetry killing spinors. in an
n=4 supergravity a vacuum can have at most 16 killing spinors, which is the
number of the real components of , and such a vacuum is called maximally
supersymmetric.

the freedman-schwarz model has no maximally supersymmetric vacua.
this is because the latter are expected to respect the maximal number of
spacetime isometries, while the model does not admit solutions with maxi-
mal symmetry. in view of the relation to ten dimensional supergravity, this
is guaranteed by the ten into four wont go theorem: n=1, d=10 su-
pergravity does not admit solutions of the form m  s3  s3, where m is
a maximal symmetry space (minkowski, de sitter, or ads) [18]. one can
also see directly that eqs. (2.23)(2.28) for s = i do not admit maximally
symmetric solutions, since the dilaton potential in (2.24) has no stationary
points. however, there are vacua in the model which are of the type of a
direct product of the two maximally symmetric spaces, ads2 e2, and these
solutions preserve half of the supersymmetries [19]. the model also admits
domain-wall-type vacua with half of the supersymmetries preserved [20, 21],
as well as other vacuum solutions which can be of various types and typically
preserve less then half of the supersymmetries [21, 22]. when lifted to ten
dimensions, some of the known fs vacua can be interpreted as the near-
horizon geometries of certain intersecting brane solutions [23, 24]. almost
all known fs vacua are characterized by the gauge elds belonging to the
cartan subalgebra of the lie algebra of su(2)su(2). only one solution is
known whose gauge eld is truly non-abelian, this is of regular monopole
type [10, 11], it preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetries and will be briey
discussed below.

19

let us now turn to the euclidean freedman-schwarz model. in this case
we can get rid of the dilaton potential by choosing g(1) = g(2). this allows
us to set in eqs. (2.23)(2.28) the vector elds to zero and scalar elds to
constant values. the non-trivial bosonic equations then reduce to

r = 0 ,

(4.1)

whose solution can be any gravitational instanton m4. the conditions  =
 = 0 read

  = 0 ,
g(1) (1  5)  = 0 ,

(4.2)

with  being the geometrical covariant derivative, which requires that m4
should admit chiral geometrical killing spinors (remember that the euclidean
majorana condition for  is compatible with the weyl condition). this gives
the simplest vacua in the efs model, and these can be uplifted to d=10 with
the use of eqs. (2.6) and (2.22) leading to solutions of the form m4  s3 
ads3, the radii of the internal manifolds being 1/g(1). the d=10 dilaton is
constant, while the antisymmetric tensor eld coincides up to g2
(1) with the
direct sum of the volume forms on the internal three-spaces.

the efs vacua described above include the at instanton e4, which
is maximally symmetric.
in view of the chirality condition in (4.2) this
has only eight killing spinors and thus is not maximally supersymmetric.
the reason for this is clear from the ten-dimensional point of view, since
e4  s3  ads3 is not maximally symmetric. for g(1)  0 the second
condition in (4.2) disappears and the number of supersymmetries doubles,
while the ten-dimensional conguration reduces to the at metric.

one can also study more complex efs vacua, in particular those with
non-trivial scalars and gauge elds. such solutions are probably relatively
easy to obtain in the case where the gauge elds belong to the cartan sub-
algebra. however, since we have a gauged supergravity, our primary interest
will be in congurations with essentially non-abelian structures, and we shall
explicitly present such solutions below. our strategy will be as follows. first,
we shall further reduce the theory from d=4 to d=3 and recover in this case
the relation between the fs and efs models via g(2)  ig(2), which has been
the main motivation for the present work. next, we shall impose spherical
symmetry and give a complete derivation of the supersymmetry constraints

20

and the bogomolnyi equations. finally we shall describe the known non-
abelian solutions of the bogomolnyi equations and their interpretation.

4.1 reduction to d=3

we wish to further reduce the four-dimensional theory specied by (2.30),
(3.27), (3.36) to d=3. in order to maintain consistency of the procedure we
shall again work at the level of equations of motion and, as usual, keep both
values of the parameter s. in brief, our dimensional reduction ansatz is


x0 = 0, a(2)a

 = 0, a(1)a

0 = 0,

a = 0.

(4.3)

the rst condition here means that /x0 is a killing vector, and thus there
is a gauge where all variables depend only on the spatial coordinates xi (we
shall denote the spatial base space and tangent space indices by bold-faced
letters i, k = 1, 2, 3 and a, b = 1, 2, 3, respectively). next, the bosonic eld
equations (2.23)(2.28) show that one can consistently set the second gauge
eld to zero, a(2)a
 = 0. however, we keep at the same time g(2) 6= 0. this
leaves us with only one gauge eld, aa
, whose gauge group is su(2).
without loss of generality we can assume that g(1) = 1. next, we require that
aa
0 = 0, and this implies that the f f invariant of the gauge eld vanishes.
it follows then from eq. (2.28) that one can consistently set the axion to
zero, a = 0. finally, we assume that the killing vector /x0 is hypersurface
orthogonal, in which case the metric can be chosen as

  a(1)a



ds2 = s2e2v dt2 + hik dxidxk .

(4.4)

as a result, we are now left with only the metric amplitude v , the three-
metric hik, the dilaton , and the three-dimensional gauge eld aa
i . in the
lorentzian case (s = i) our truncation corresponds to the static and purely
magnetic sector of the fs model with the second gauge eld set to zero. in
the euclidean (s = 1) domain the notions static and purely magnetic do
not have an invariant meaning. it will be convenient to use together with the
three-metric hik also its conformally rescaled version, gik, the spatial line
element being

dl2 = hikdxidxk = e2v gikdxidxk = abab ,

(4.5)

21

where a are the basis one-forms, which are dual to the triad ea.

one can verify that under the conditions in (4.3) and (4.4) the d=4 eld
equations (2.23)(2.28) consistently reduce to the lagrangian equations for
the action

reduction above has been done for both values of s. at the same time, the
s-dependence is now almost completely gone, and if we ignored the dilaton
potential then the eld equations would be exactly the same in the euclidean
and lorentzian cases. this is because the system is static and purely
magnetic. it is only the explicit dependence of the dilaton potential on s
that breaks the complete symmetry between the two cases.

where the last equality on the right is due to (4.10). this shows that 0
is not independent and vanishes whenever other susy variations vanish,
provided that the condition (4.10) holds, the latter thus being one of the
supersymmetry conditions.

we have completed the reduction to d=3. the bosonic sector of the
resulting theory is described by eqs. (4.6), (4.7) together with the constraint
in (4.10), while the fermion susy transformations are given by (4.11). we
now make the following observation. all expressions above depend on s only
via the ratio  = g(2)/s. for real values of  we obtain the efs model, while
choosing  imaginary gives the fs model. this shows that starting from the
static, purely magnetic sector of the freedman-schwarz supergravity and
making the formal replacement g(2)  i g(2) gives the static and purely
magnetic sector of the euclidean freedman-schwarz theory. this explains
the empirical observation made in ref.[14] that a formal analytic continuation
in the supergravity equations gives a meaningful result  because we obtain
in this way another consistent supergravity model.

the d=3 eld equations in (4.6), (4.7), (4.10) allow one to study the
static solutions. as there is little hope to directly solve the equations for the
bosonic action (4.6), one can start from the equations for the supersymmetry
killing spinors  obtained from (4.10) by setting  = j = 0. the consis-
tency conditions for these equations can be formulated as a set of rst order
bogomolnyi equations for the underlying bosonic conguration. the bogo-
molnyi equations are compatible with the second order eld equations and
their solutions automatically give supersymmetric vacua. so far, however,
the corresponding construction has been carried out only for the spherically
symmetric elds. these will be considered below.

23

4.2 spherical symmetry

let us consider the reduction of the d=3 theory described by eqs. (4.6), (4.7)
and (4.10) to the spherically symmetric sector. the most general spherically
symmetric 3-metric is

(4.13)
where d2 = d2 + sin2  d2 is the line element of the unit sphere. the
spherically symmetric and purely magnetic yang-mills eld is given by

dl2 = e2 dr2 + e2 d2 ,

a = w (t2 d + t1 sin  d) + t3 cos  d.

(4.14)

here ,  , w as well as the dilaton  depend only on the radial coordinate r,
and the reparameterization invariance r  r(r) implies that one coordinate
condition can be imposed on the four amplitudes. taking the condition in
(4.10) into account, the 4-metric reads

ds2 = s2e2() dt2 + dl2 .

(4.15)

the complete set of the eld equations for the bosonic action (4.6) is

dr . the same equations can be obtained by varying the four

the supersymmetric vacua that we shall be considering are solutions to
these equations for which there are non-trivial s such that  = j = 0. of
course, it is very dicult to directly solve the non-linear equations in (4.16)
(apart from some trivial cases). for this reason we shall start from the equa-
tions  = j = 0 for the killing spinors . these equations are sometimes
called supersymmetry constraints, and they are generically inconsistent. one
can analyze the consistency conditions under which non-trivial solutions for

24

the s exist. these conditions can be given in the form of a set of nonlinear
rst order dierential equations for the underlying bosonic conguration 
usually called bogomolnyi equations. the bogomolnyi equations are com-
patible with the second order eld equations, and their solutions therefore
describe supersymmetric vacua.

following this strategy, our procedure will be to analyze the supersym-
metry constraints  = j = 0 obtained from eqs. (4.11) in the case of
spherical symmetry.

4.2.1 the supersymmetry constraints

it is convenient to choose the isotropic gauge in the line element (4.15),
re = e , and then to pass to the cartesian coordinates xi with r = ikxixk.
the three-metric reads

dl2 = e2 (dr2 + r2 d2) = e2ikdxidxk .

(4.17)

the triad vectors and one-forms are ea = ea and a = edxa, respectively.
the spin-connection is

(4.19)

(4.20)

(4.21)

here we handle the triad and internal indices with the metric tensors ab and
ab and allow for objects with mixed indices like aab and aa.

let us now introduce four dierent spinor two-spaces and denote the
corresponding pauli matrices by a, a,  a,  a, respectively. we choose the
gamma matrices and group generators as

a = 2  a,

5 = 3  1l2 , ta =

2i

 a  1l2 .

(4.22)

25

here 1l2 acts in the  a space.
in what follows we shall not write down
explicitly the direct product sign and the unit operators. taking into account
all the denitions above, the susy variations in (4.11) assume the form

here (~n~) = abnab, also (~n~ ) = abna b, and (~~ ) = aba b.

let us recall that  is a 16-component spinor subject to the majorana

condition

() = 2  2  1 

for real  (euclidean theory), and

() = 2 2  2  2 

(4.24)

(4.25)

for imaginary  (lorentzian theory). now, since we are considering spheri-
cally symmetric backgrounds, it is natural to choose  to be an eigenstate of
the total angular momentum. let us rst study the sector with zero angular
momentum, j = 0; the case of j > 0 will be discussed later. we choose

q q + ()

q 2q(~n~)(cid:17)(cid:16) +    +(cid:17)  .

 = q  (cid:16)(+)
here q = 1, ()
are functions of r, while q, , , and  are constant
two-component spinors from the four dierent spinor spaces in which the
operators a, a,  a,  a, respectively, act. one has 3q = qq, 3 =

these are the supersymmetry constraints we are interested in.

4.2.2 the bogomolnyi equations

it is not dicult to nd the consistency conditions for eqs. (4.28)(4.30).
consider, for example, eq.
(4.30). this is in fact a system of two ho-
mogeneous algebraic equations, which has a non-trivial solution only if the
determinant of the coecient matrix vanishes. the same is true with (4.29).
in addition, the solutions obtained from (4.29) and (4.30) should agree. as a
result, we obtain three algebraic conditions for the coecients in eqs. (4.29)
and (4.30), which can be expressed in the form

1 + r

= sw2 +
= 2q w + q22(w2  1)  2w2(b + 1) ,
= (b + 1)(q + w(b  1)) ,

(4.31)

with a  8w e2(ln r) + q (b  1) and b  2e2(ln r)(w2  1). under
these conditions eqs. (4.29) and (4.30) specify the algebraic relation between

27

q

and ()

(+)
. next, this relation should be consistent with the remaining
dierential constraints in (4.28). a direct calculation shows that the required
consistency holds by virtue of eqs. (4.31). the dierential constraints (4.28)
then x the solution for ()

uniquely  up to a normalization constant,

(4.32)

as a result, the equations in (4.31) constitute a complete set of consistency
conditions under which the supersymmetry killing spinors exist. these rst
order bogomolnyi equations are compatible (for q = 1) with the second
order eld equations in (4.16). in orther words, they are rst integrals for
the eld equations. although this fact is expected, its direct verication is
not at all trivial and provides a very good check of the consistency of the
whole procedure. any solution of the bogomolnyi equations hence fullls
the eld equations and admits non-trivial supersymmetry killing spinors,
thus describing a supersymmetric vacuum.

before we pass to studying the bogomolnyi equations, let us count the
number of supersymmetry killing spinors obtained from (4.26), (4.28)(4.30).
consider rst the efs case, where  is real. then all coecients in eqs.
(4.28)(4.30) are real and the solution for ()
in (4.32) can be chosen to be
real as well. as was mentioned above, this solution is specied uniquely. we
do not obtain solutions for both values of q, since the bogomolnyi equations
for  6= 0 are not invariant under q  q, but only under

q

q  q,

w  w .

(4.33)

thus, unless w  0, the value of q is xed by the background conguration
and there is only one solution for the ()
. notice however that eq. (4.26)
contains an additional degeneracy due to the arbitrary constant spinor .
the majorana condition imposes the restrictions

q

q = (cid:16)q(cid:17)

,

 1 = (cid:16)(cid:17)

.

(4.34)

there are two independent solutions to these conditions for a given q. this
nally gives two supersymmetry killing spinors. for  = 0 the number of
supersymmetries doubles, since the bogomolnyi equations are then invariant
under q  q and both values of q are allowed in (4.26) and (4.34).

28

consider now the fs case, where  is imaginary. then  = 0 is the only
allowed value, since otherwise the bogomolnyi equations contain imaginary
coecients and their solutions are not real. the solution for  is given by
(4.26), where one can take both values of q, and again there is an additional
degeneracy due to . in order to fulll the majorana condition in this case
one should take linear combinations of solutions with dierent q. omitting
the index q of q, the majorana condition in (4.25) reduces to

and this has four independent solutions.

(2) ( 2) = (cid:16) (cid:17)

,

(4.35)

to recapitulate, supersymmetric vacua exist in the efs model for ar-
bitrary real , and in the fs case for  = 0 only. for  6= 0 the vacua
preserve two supersymmetries. for  = 0, when one of the two gauge cou-
pling constants vanishes and the theory is half-gauged, the vacuum admits
four supersymmetry killing spinors and fullls the equations of both fs and
efs models.

it is worth noting that the above analysis uses only the killing spinors
from the sector with zero angular momentum, j = 0. at the same time, there
could be additional killing spinors for j > 0, even though the background
is spherically symmetric. indeed, as was mentioned above, the e4 instanton
solution, which is given by  =  = 0 and w =  = 1, has eight killing
spinors. of these only two are recovered in the system (4.28)(4.30), and
the remaining six must therefore reside in sectors with j > 0. these sectors
therefore should also be taken into consideration. now, one can show that
any additional killing spinors can only exist for j = 1. in this case the whole
procedure described above can be repeated, which leads to a system of seven
non-linear bogomolnyi equations for the three amplitudes w, , and . the
e4 instanton fullls these new equations, which accounts for its additional
six killing spinors. however, since the equations are overdetermined, it is
unclear whether they admit any other solutions. we shall not concentrate
on this here but rather pass to considering the solutions of the bogomolnyi
equations (4.31). for these solutions one can show that all their killing
spinors live in the j = 0 sector.

29

4.2.3 vacuum solutions for  = 0. supersymmetric monopoles

it is not dicult to see that the bogomolnyi equations in (4.31) can be made
autonomous, in which case the system essentially reduces to one rst order
dierential equation. this equation turns out to be rather complicated, but
it can be analyzed for special values of . let us consider the value  = 0,
in which case the solutions will have n=1 supersymmetry. denoting x  w2
and r  1

2 e2(+ln r), eqs. (4.31) give [10, 11]

x(r + x  1)

dr
dx

+ (x + 1) r + (x  1)2 = 0 .

(4.36)

the two remaining bogomolnyi equations are solved by quadratures as soon
as the solution r(x) is obtained. after the substitution [10]

x = 2 ey(),

r = 

dy()
d  2 ey()  1,

the abel equation (4.36) reduces to the liouville equation

d2y
d2 = 2 ey,

(4.37)

(4.38)

which is integrable. this gives a globally regular solution described by

ds2 = 2 e2(cid:16)s2dt2 + d2 + r d2(cid:17) ,

r = 2 coth  



, e2 =

where the scaling symmetry (4.8) has been used to set (0) = 0. the new
result we obtain here as compared to that of [10] is that this solution turns
out to be the vacuum of both the fs and efs models, preserving in each case
1/4 of the supersymmetries. corresponding to this there is the parameter s
in the metric in (4.39).

for s = 1 the solution describes a globally regular riemannian manifold
with an essentially non-abelian gauge eld. since the conguration does not
depend on t, the action is innite. passing to the lorentzian sector via choos-
ing s = i, the solution describes a globally regular magnetic monopole with
unit charge. this is geodesically complete and globally hyperbolic [10, 11].

figure 1: the numerical solution of the bogomolnyi equation (4.41).

unfortunately, the adm mass is innite and the solution is not asymptoti-
cally at  due to the dilaton potential. in view of its supersymmetry, it is
very plausible that the lorentzian solution is stable, while for its euclidean
counterpart the notion of dynamical stability makes no sense.

4.2.4 vacuum solutions for  = 1. supersymmetric sphalerons

for any  6= 0 solutions of the bogomolnyi equations (4.31) will preserve
only 1/8 of the supersymmetries. let us consider the value  = 1, in which
case the dilaton potential vanishes. after some transformations described in
[14] the bogomolnyi equations can be reduced to

unfortunately, analytical solutions to eq. (4.41) are unknown (apart from
singular ones [14]). the numerical integration (see fig.1) reveals the exis-
tence of a globally regular solution in the interval r  [0,) which mono-
tonically interpolates between the values specied by the local asymptotic
3 r2 + o(r4) for r  0 and w = 1 + 22 r1 + o(r2)
solutions: w = 1  2
as r  . this gives a globally regular supersymmetric euclidean solution
with non-trivial yang-mills eld and innite action.
one can pass to the lorentzian sector by changing the sign of dt2 in the
metric (4.45). the resulting conguration fullls the equations of motion of
the einstein-yang-mills-dilaton (eymd) model with the action

the static and purely magnetic sector of this model can be embedded into
the heterotic string theory. however, the solution is not supersymmetric
in this model, since it is not self-dual [3]. nevertheless, this eymd solu-
tion is interesting as it describes a regular particle-like object with nite
adm mass m determined by the asymptotic behaviour of the metric in
(4.45), e2() = 1  2me() r1 + o(r2) [14]. this eymd particle
is static, spherically symmetric and neutral, but it has a non-trivial purely
magnetic gauge eld that asymptotically vanishes like 1/r3. it turns out that
this solution resembles the well-known sphaleron solution of the weinberg-
salam theory [25]. specically, one can show that the solution relates to
the top of the potential barrier between the topological vacua of the eymd
theory, which implies in particular that it is unstable. this suggests the
name eymd sphaleron. one can argue that this solution is responsible for
fermion number non-conserving processes in heterotic string theory. despite
its instability, it bears an imprint of supersymmetry as it fullls the rst order

32

bogomolnyi equations. passing back to the euclidean theory, the counter-
part of the eymd sphaleron is a genuinely supersymmetric conguration,
and we call it supersymmetric sphaleron.

historically, it was the eymd sphaleron solution which was rst obtained
by numerical integration of the second order eld equations for the action
(4.46) [26, 27, 28]. only later it was discovered in [14] that the solution fullls
the rst order bogomolnyi equation (4.41), and it was conjectured that the
conguration becomes supersymmetric upon continuation to the euclidean
sector. the justication of this conjecture has been the main subject of the
present paper.

5 conclusion

in this paper we have studied the dimensional reduction of the n=1, d=10
supergravity on s3  ads3. the resulting four-dimensional theory is eu-
clidean n=4 gauged su(2)su(1,1) supergravity with the bosonic lagrangian
(2.30) and the fermion supersymmetry transformations specied by (3.27),
(3.36). an interesting feature of this model is that its dilaton potential u()
can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the values of the two gauge
coupling constants. this allows one to apply the model for generating vari-
ous solutions with gravitating yang-mills elds via solving the bogomolnyi
equations, which sometimes even gives solutions in a closed analytical form.
the two examples  monopole-type and sphaleron-type non-abelian vacua
 were described above. in view of the relation to n=1, d=10 supergravity,
which is in turn related to d=11 supergravity [16], any solution of the theory
can be uplifted to become a vacuum of string or m theory.

it is worth noting that reductions on adssphere are often considered;
see for example [29]. in particular, gravity and string theory on ads3  s3
have been studied in detail [31, 30]. in our analysis, however, the emphasis is
quite dierent, since we are interested not in an eective lorentzian theory
with an ads ground state, but rather in a euclidean theory admitting e4
as a vacuum. let us also note that in most cases the dimensional reduc-
tion is performed only at the level of the lagrangian, which raises the issue
of consistency; see [7, 8] for a recent discussion. our results on the other
hand provide an example of a consistent reduction carried out at the level of
equations of motion.

33

one can expect that the model described above admits interesting so-
lutions also beyond the static, spherically symmetric and purely magnetic
sector with u() = 0. for u() > 0 these could be, for example, compact in-
stantons, and possibly also non-compact, asymptotically at congurations.
for u() = 0 the theory probably admits non-compact instantons with nite
action. one can also study static multi-sphaleron solutions by deriving the
bogomolnyi equations from eqs. (4.11). an interpretation of the euclidean
solutions can sometimes be obtained by continuation to the lorentzian sec-
tor  negative energy states will not arise if the su(1,1) gauge eld vanishes.
all solutions for gravitating yang-mills elds of this type are expected to
be relevant for string/m-theory and in the context of the general study of
non-linear phenomena in eld theory.
