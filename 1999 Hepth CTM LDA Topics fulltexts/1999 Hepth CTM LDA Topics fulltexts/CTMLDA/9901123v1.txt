abstract

using free world-sheet fermions, we construct and classify all the n = 2, z2  z2 four-
dimensional orbifolds of the type iia/b strings for which the orbifold projections act sym-
metrically on the left and right movers. we study the deformations of these models out of the
fermionic point, deriving the partition functions at a generic point in the moduli of the inter-
nal torus t 6 = t 2t 2t 2. we investigate some of their perturbative and non-perturbative
dualities and construct new dual pairs of type iia/type ii asymmetric orbifolds, which are
related non-perturbatively and allow us to gain insight into some of the non-perturbative
properties of the type iia/b strings in four dimensions. in particular, we consider some of
the (non-)perturbative gravitational corrections.

1. introduction

during the recent years, duality has played a fundamental role in the progress of string theory.
however, despite the huge amount of work done in this eld, in most of the cases duality
has remained a conjecture, based more on eld theory and supersymmetry/supergravity
considerations than on tests made directly at the string level [1]. actually, in order to
perform string-loop computations, it is necessary to go to special points of the moduli space,
in which it is possible to solve the two-dimensional conformal eld theory. in this paper, we
study a class of four-dimensional compactications of type ii strings, with two space-time
supersymmetries, for which this is possible. our main interest is in what we call z2  z2
symmetric orbifolds, namely orbifold constructions in which the n = 8 supersymmetry is
reduced to n = 2 by two z2 projections that act symmetrically on the left and right movers.
these orbifolds are of particular interest because they can be easily realized through a free
fermion construction [2][5]. in this framework, the various constraints and requirements of
a consistent string theory construction are collected in a set of rules, which can be easily
handled. in particular, we show that it is possible to write a general formula for the gso
projections, which allows us to give a complete classication of such orbifolds.

all of these constructions can be seen as compactications on singular limits of cy

manifolds. for all the models, the scalar manifolds are coset spaces:

su(1, 1)
u(1) 

so(2, 2 + nv )

so(2)  so(2 + nv )

and

so(4, 4 + nh )

so(4)  so(4 + nh)

,

(1.1)

describing respectively the space of the nv + 3 moduli in the vector multiplets and that of
the nh + 4 in the hypermultiplets. for each pair (nv , nh ) there always exists a construc-
tion for which nv and nh are exchanged, corresponding to a compactication on the mirror
manifold. some of them, namely the models with nv = nh = 16, 8, 0, correspond to com-
pactications on cy manifolds already investigated, although in slightly dierent contexts
[6][9].

for each model, we write the (one-loop) partition function, which encodes all the in-
formation about its perturbative physics. we then establish the exact equivalence, for this
class of orbifolds, of the fermionic construction and a geometric construction based on bosons
compactied at special radii. in this way, we show that, once these orbifolds are constructed
at the fermionic point, it is possible to switch on some moduli, namely the moduli t i, u i,
i = 1, 2, 3, which on type iia are associated respectively with the kahler class moduli and
the complex structure moduli of the three tori into which the compact space is factorized by
the orbifold projections. the derivation of the partition functions, for any such construction,
at a generic point in the space of these moduli, constitutes one of the main results of this
paper. this allows us to investigate some deformations of the models. in particular, from
the analysis of certain helicity supertraces [10][14], which distinguish between various bps
and non-bps states, we read o the presence of perturbative higgs and super-higgs phenom-
ena. the rst account for the appearance of new massless states in particular corners of the
moduli space, while the second, besides that, determine the restoration of a certain number
of supersymmetries. such properties play a key role in the search for dual constructions.

1

in particular, it is possible to recognize which models correspond to compactications on
orbifold limits of k3 brations [15, 16]. in these cases, the heterotic dual constructions can
be easily identied [17][19]. in this paper, we focus our attention on the duality between
type iia/b and type ii asymmetric constructions, in which all the supersymmetries come
from the left movers only, the supersymmetries of the other chirality being projected out
by ()fr, the right fermion number operator. in these constructions, as in the heterotic
n = 2 compactications, the dilatonaxion eld belongs to a vector multiplet, and the type
iia/type ii asymmetric dual pairs are related by a u-duality similar to the duality of the
type iia/heterotic strings (examples of such dual pairs were previously considered in [9, 19]).
this implies that a perturbative computation performed on one side gives information on
the non-perturbative physics of the dual. in this paper we present in detail the construc-
tion of such type ii asymmetric duals. then, as in [18, 19], we consider r2 corrections,
which serve both as a test of duality and as the actual computation of a quantity that is
non-perturbative in the type ii asymmetric duals. on the other hand, an investigation of
the perturbative super-higgs phenomena present in the type ii asymmetric models tells us
about the presence of an analogous phenomenon also in the type iia/b duals, in which it is
entirely non-perturbative and could not be seen from an analysis of the helicity supertraces.

the paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we present the fermionic construction of the n = 2, type iia/b z2  z2
symmetric orbifolds and we discuss the analysis of the massless spectrum. the reader can nd
a short reminder of the rules of the fermionic construction in appendix a, while more details
on the massless spectrum are given in appendix b. at the end of the section we explain our
method of classication of such constructions, quoting in appendix c the general formulae
for the gso projections.

in section 3 we derive the partition functions of the various models. we establish the
equivalence of world-sheet fermions and bosons, thereby deriving the partition functions at
a generic point in the toroidal moduli t i, u i. the classication of the partition functions is
given in appendix d.

in section 4 we compute the helicity supertraces and interpret the various orbifold oper-

ations in terms of stringy higgs and super-higgs phenomena.

in section 5 we discuss the mirror symmetry, in the context of these symmetric orbifolds,
and the non-perturbative dualities relating some of these models to heterotic duals and/or to
type ii asymmetric constructions. the type iia/type ii asymmetric dual pairs are discussed
in detail in sections 5.2 and 5.3, where we quote also the partition function for the type ii
asymmetric orbifolds. we discuss the corrections to the r2 term. the dual pairs are then
compared in section 5.4, in which we discuss some of their non-perturbative aspects. a
detailed discussion of shifted lattice sums and their integrals over the fundamental domain
is in appendix e, while in appendix f we discuss the computation of helicity supertraces
for the type ii asymmetric orbifolds.

our comments and conclusions are given in section 6.

the use of free world-sheet fermions turns out to be convenient for the analysis of the
massless spectrum and the general classication of the z2  z2 type ii symmetric orbifolds.
in order to construct them, we start from the n = 8 type ii string, which is described, in the
light-cone gauge, by 8 world-sheet left/right moving bosonic and fermionic coordinates, x l,r
and l,r
( = 1, 2) represent
the space-time transverse degrees of freedom, whereas the remaining ones correspond to the
internal degrees of freedom. the n = 8 string has therefore four space-time supersymmetries
originating from the left-moving sector and four from the right-moving sector. we then
introduce z2 projections, which act symmetrically on left/right moving coordinates, reducing
the number of supersymmetries to n = 2, one coming from the left and one from the right
movers. in the fermionic construction [2][4], the x l,r
, (i = 3, ..., 8) are replaced by the pairs
of majoranaweyl spinors l,r
, (i = 1, ..., 6). to follow the standard notation of
the fermionic construction [5], we rename the internal components of the elds l,r
as l,r
.
the construction of string models then amounts to a choice of boundary conditions for the
fermions, which satises local and global consistency requirements. a model is dened by a
basis of sets i (i = 1, ..., n) of fermions and by a modular-invariant choice of n(n  1)/2 + 1
phases (modular coecients) c(i|j), which determine the gso projections (we refer the
reader to appendix a for more details). in this language, the n = 8 model is constructed
by introducing three basis sets, namely f , which contains all the left- and right-moving
fermions:

and the sets s and s, which contain only eight left- or right-moving fermions, and distinguish
the boundary conditions of the left- and right- moving world-sheet superpartners:

in order to obtain a z2  z2 symmetric orbifold, we add to the basis the two sets b1 and b2:

these sets assign z2 boundary conditions, thereby introducing new projections, which break
the n = 8 supersymmetry.

the denition of the model is completed by the choice of the following modular coe-

table 2.1: the coecient c(i|j) is given by the (i, j) entry of the matrix.

this choice corresponds to a type iia compactication1. six of the eight gravitinos are
projected out and we are left with only two supersymmetries, whose generators can be read-
o from the 1/2 picture vertex operator representation of the surviving gravitinos, given
in (b.2).

it is easy to check that the massless spectrum ts into representations of the n = 2
supersymmetry. this is done by constructing the vertex operator representation of the
states, which we quote in appendix b. the n = 2 spectrum is in fact characterized by
the su(2) symmetry under which the two supercharges form a doublet.
in appendix b
we discuss in detail the construction of the generators of this su(2) symmetry. by looking
at the su(2) charge of the scalars, we identify the ones belonging to the vector multiplets
and the ones belonging to the hypermultiplets: the scalars of a hypermultiplet do transform
under the su(2) symmetry of n = 2 [20].
in particular, it is easy to see that the pair
dilatonpseudoscalar is charged and therefore belongs to a hypermultiplet. furthermore, it
is also easy to see that all the scalars belonging to hypermultiplets are charged also under
a second su(2). this allows us to conclude that the quaternionic manifold has an so(4)
symmetry, and is given by the coset

so(4, 4 + nh )

so(4)  so(4 + nh)

,

(2.5)

where nh is the number of hypermultiplets that originate from the twisted sectors (in this
case, these are the sectors b1, b2 and f s sb1b2, which, for the choice of projections specied
in table 2.1, provide the scalars of nh = 12 hypermultiplets2. a similar analysis, on the
scalars uncharged under the su(2) of the n = 2 supersymmetry, allows us to conclude that
the scalars belonging to vector multiplets span the coset:

su(1, 1)
u(1) 

so(2, 2 + nv )

so(2)  so(2 + nv )

,

(2.6)

appendix b we explain how this is implemented in the fermionic construction.

1 the type iiab exchange is realized by changing the chirality of, say, the right-moving spinors. in
2the scalars of the s s (ramondramond) sector are charged also under two other su (2)s. they
therefore have an so(4)  so(4) symmetry. the four su (2)s are the remnant of the su (8) symmetry of
the massless spectrum of the n = 8 theory, which is broken to su (2)4 by the orbifold projections.

4

with nv = 12 in this particular case.

we can construct other z2  z2 symmetric orbifolds, with a higher or lower number of
massless states originating from the twisted sectors, by varying the sets b1 and b2 and/or
adding more sets to the basis. however, it is easy to see that, once required that the
breaking of the n = 8 supersymmetry to n = 2 be symmetric in the left- and right- movers,
the untwisted sector is automatically xed to be the same as for the orbifold considered
above. by constructing then, for this class of orbifolds, the vertex operator representation
of the massless states of the twisted sectors, it is easy to check that there is always an
so(4) = su(2)  su(2) symmetry common to all the scalars of the hypermultiplets. on
the other hand, the complex scalars of the vector multiplets possess the so(2)  u(1)
symmetry of complex conjugation, as the scalars of (2.6). as a consequence, the scalar
manifolds are uniquely specied by the numbers nh and nv of hyper and vector multiplets
provided by the twisted sectors, and are always expressed by (2.5) and (2.6).

in order to give an exhaustive classication of such orbifolds, we notice that, instead of
varying the sets b1, b2, we can equivalently keep them xed and add to the fermion basis the
sets ei:

(2.7)
which factorize the six circles of the compact space (e6 is generated by the product f s s e1
e2 e3 e4 e5) by introducing independent z2 boundary conditions for all of them.

ei =(cid:8)yl

with such a basis, we can construct any z2  z2 orbifold, provided we properly choose
in fact, with these fermion sets, we can construct 48 massless
the modular coecients.
twisted sectors3, that is as many twisted sectors as the maximal number of xed points a
z2  z2 symmetric orbifold can have. each such xed point gives rise either to a vector- or
to a hypermultiplet. any specic choice of the modular coecients amounts to a choice of
gso projections, which act by excluding some sectors and determining whether the states
of the remaining sectors t into vector- or hypermultiplets.

we therefore proceed by expressing nv and nh , for each twisted sector, as functions
of the modular coecients (we quote the general formula of the gso projections on the
48 twisted sectors in appendix c). then we x the coecients that determine the gso
projections onto the untwisted sector (rr sector included), because they amount to an
arbitrary choice of the chirality of the spinors; we then vary all the other gso projections, by
allowing a change in the coecients c(b1|e1), c(b1|e2), c(b2|e3), c(b2|e4), c(e1|e2), c(e1|e3), c(e1|e4),
c(e1|e5), c(e2|e3), c(e2|e4), c(e2|e5), c(e3|e4), c(e3|e5), c(e4|e5), c(b1|f e3e4), c(b2|f e1e2) and c(b1b2|e5).
in this way we obtain all the possible (nv , nh) pairs. the coecient c(b1|b2) determines,
instead, the general projection onto the chirality of the bispinors of the twisted sectors.
under a change of sign of this coecient, nv and nh get exchanged. as a consequence,
each pair (nv , nh) appears accompanied by its mirror (nh , nv ). we list the pairs (nv , nh)
in table d.1. indeed, what we obtain is much more than a simple classication of the possible
massless spectra: having performed such an analysis on the single twisted sectors, we actually
obtain a complete classication of the possible orbifold projections, something that, as we
will see in the following, allows us to reconstruct the one-loop partition function of each

orbifold, even away from the fermionic point.

3. the partition functions

in the type ii z2  z2 symmetric constructions, the degrees of freedom of the compact space
can be equivalently described by compactied bosons. the conditions of existence of the two
world-sheet supercurrents (a.1) allow in fact dierent z2 boundary conditions to be assigned
not to single fermions but only to sets of bilinears of fermions. the symmetry between left
and right movers implies that such bilinears must always appear paired in such a way as to
form compact bosons. indeed, we want to show in the following that all the above models
can be constructed as orbifolds by using the symmetries of the conformal theory of six bosons
compactied on a torus t 6 at the point of moduli for which it is described by a product of
circles t 6 = s1  . . .  s1 4. in this approach, the dependence on the geometrical moduli of
t 6 is explicit5. in order to see what is the partition function at a generic point in t 6, we use
identities satised by the modular forms and recast the partition function of free fermions as
a sum over lattice momenta and windings, as in the case of a single boson. by substituting
generic values of moduli in the lattice sums, wethen get the partition function of the model
at any value in the orbifold moduli space.

the partition function, at the fermionic point (see appendix a), is given by the integral

over the modular parameter  , with modular-invariant measure ( im  )2d d , of:

4in some cases, the factorization t 6 = t 2  t 2  t 2 is sucient.
5in the fermionic construction the moduli dependence was not manifest, because compactied bosons can
be fermionized only for some particular values of moduli. for instance, in the case of a single boson, the
fermionic partition function corresponds to the bosonic one when the radius of compactication r is 1. the
fermionic construction must, however, be considered as describing a model at a particular point in moduli
space.

(0, 0), (h1 + h2, g1 + g2) 6= (0, 0).

the n = 8 sector is universal:
it is the same for any orbifold, since it is proportional to
the unprojected partition function of the n = 8 string. in the n = 2 = (1, 1) sector all
the bosons of the compact space are twisted and/or projected: this implies that the part of
the partition function that corresponds to this sector is the same at any point in the moduli
space of the orbifold. the only non-trivial moduli dependence is contained in the n = 4
sectors: in the following, we will therefore concentrate on these.

in each n = 4 sector the moduli dependence is contained in the untwisted c = (2, 2)
conformal block. the latter corresponds to the complex planes (1,2) (for the rst n = 4
sector), (3,4) in the second sector and (5,6) in the third sector. we want to rewrite such
blocks in terms of sums over lattice windings and momenta. to this purpose, we make use
of the identity:

which generalizes the equivalence of the partition functions of two weylmajorana fermions
and one boson at radius 1 to the case of two bosons toroidally compactied, with generic
lattice shifts (h1, h2, g1, g2) in the momenta and windings in the two circles. here w 
(w1, w2) stays for a pair of lattice vectors w1, w2, which specify the directions of the shifts
(see appendix e). we do not need to specify the particular value, which depends on the
shift vectors, of the toroidal kahler and complex structure moduli t and u for which the
equivalence (3.11) is valid. this, however, can be easily computed, and we refer to appendix
e for this detail. in our case, the pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2) are substituted by ( + e1,  + d1),
( + e2,  + d2) in the rst n = 4 sector, ( + e3,  + d3), ( + e4,  + d4) in the second, and

ing to the fact that in a twisted/shifted lattice character (cid:2)h|h

twist (h, g) imposes a constraint on the shift (h, g) ((h, g) = (0, 0) or (h, g) = (h, g)), it
turns out that in the n = 4 sectors all the shifts can be expressed in terms of the two z2
supersymmetry-breaking projections introduced by the sets b1 and b2 (these may or may not
act freely, by translating some of the coordinates of the compact space), and in terms of the
projections associated to the symmetries of each c = (1, 1), s1/z2 orbifold, generated by the
two elements [21]:

g|g(cid:3), when (h, g) 6= (0, 0) the

(3.12)
(3.13)

here +,  are the two twist elds of s1/z2, and vnm are the untwisted vacua labelled by the
momentum m and the winding number n. the orbifolds we are considering indeed possess

8

such symmetries. in fact, the presence, in the fermionic basis, of the sets ei, i = 1, . . . , 5
corresponds to a choice of coordinates for which the compact space is described by a product
of circles: t 6 = s1  . . .  s1. any one of the z2 (bi) projections (i = 1, 2, 3 = 1 + 2),
then creates a c = (4, 4) twisted block that corresponds to an orbifold (s1)4 /z2 (bi). (the
construction with complex planes corresponds instead to the separation [t 2  t 2] /z2 (bi).
at this point in the moduli space, it is possible to remove some of the xed points, by
using such symmetries. to simplify the discussion, we will consider in the following only
the rst generator, d (the action of d can be obtained by t -duality). modding out by the
group generated by d amounts to cutting half of the states in the twisted sector and to a
modication of the lattice of momenta and windings: the momenta are restricted to even
values and the windings are shifted to half-integer values. in order to realize this projection,
we must pair the d-projection on the twisted c = (4, 4) block with a translation in one
direction of the untwisted c = (2, 2) block. from (3.12), we see that this translation can
itself be considered as a d-projection. the operation therefore amounts to the insertion of
a d-projection into two circles belonging to two dierent complex planes. there are then
always two n = 4 sectors for which the pair of d-operations acts by reducing the number
of xed points.

in order to account for the various possibilities, we extend the denition of twisted/shifted

c = (2, 2) conformal blocks to account also for the d-operations. we therefore dene

(i)

2,2(cid:20)h; h1, h2 | h 1, h 2
g; g1, g2 | g1, g2(cid:21),

i = 1, 2, 3,

(3.14)

where the index i indicates the planes (1,2), (3,4) and (5,6) respectively. the pair (h, g)
species the ordinary twist, the pairs (h1, g1), (h2, g2) specify the lattice shifts in the two
circles of t 2, while the pairs (h 1, g1), (h 2, g2) refer to the d-operations. when (h, g) 6=
(0, 0), the block is non-zero only if (h 1, g1), (h 2, g2) equal (0, 0) or (h, g). in this case,
also the shifts (h1, g1), (h2, g2) are constrained in the same way: (h1, g1), (h2, g2) = (0, 0) or
(h, g) and we set, by denition,

2,2(cid:20)h; h1, h2 | h 1, h 2

g; g1, g2 | g1, g2(cid:21)(h,g)6=(0,0) 

(hi, gi), (h j, gj) = (0, 0) or = (h, g) .

(3.15)

(3.16)

when (h, g) = (0, 0), the d-action amounts to a shift, which adds to the shifts (h1, g1),
(h2, g2). in this case, (3.14) is a doubly shifted lattice sum; the lattice shifts in the two circles
are specied by (h1 + h 1, g1 + g1) and (h2 + h 2, g2 + g2):

2,2(cid:20)0; h1, h2 | h 1, h 2

0; g1, g2 | g1, g2(cid:21) = 2,2(cid:20)h1 + h 1, h2 + h 2
g1 + g1, g2 + g2(cid:21) .

(3.17)

there is, however, a subtlety: the pair of d-operations was dened as a projection, which
mods out states by using a symmetry of the twisted sector.
it makes sense only when
the z2 (b) projections do not act freely. the recipe is that one rst projects with at least
one z2 (b), to reduce supersymmetry to n = 4 or n = 2, then the d-projection can be

9

inserted in the z2 (b)-twisted sectors and related to a shift in the untwisted coordinates.
if the z2 (b) acts freely, i.e. has no xed points, such an operation cannot be performed.
this means that the d-operation is not independent of the shifts (hi, gi), i = 1, 2, which in
turn depend on the two projections introduced by b1 and b2. we can however extend the
denition of the d-projection to include also the case of freely acting orbifolds, by specifying
that, in the absence of xed points, it acts simply as a shift, i.e. as the natural restriction
of (3.12), with the constraint that it must always act in a direction independent of that of
(~h, ~g) = {(h1, g1), (h2, g2)}. its interference with the shift (~h, ~g) then produces the following
shifted lattice sum:

in the above expression, the shifts (~h, ~g) depend on the projections z2 (bi), and can al-
ways be expressed in terms of the twists (h1, g1), (h2, g2), while ~h  (h 1, . . . , h 6),
~g  (g1, . . . , g6) refer to the d-projections. at a generic point in the moduli space, the
partition function (3.1) becomes:

though nd can be greater than 2, in each n = 4 sector the maximal number of projections

possible to pick a modular-invariant shift (see appendix c of [12]). further projections

where cij can be either +1 or ()h igj +h j gi; (h i, gi), (h j, gj) refer to the d-operations in
the circles i, j. these coecients are always +1 in the n = 4 sectors; however they can play
a role in the n = 2 sector.

as is clear from the denition of twisted/shifted lattice given in (3.14) and its properties,
an n = 4 sector can provide 16, 8, 4 or 0 supermultiplets, depending on the shift (~h, ~g)
and on the d-projections. thanks to the interpretation of the dierent choices of modular
coecients in terms of such operations, we understand why it is not possible to obtain models
with any number nv + nh of supermultiplets between 48 and 0, modulo 4 (with the obvious
exception of 44, which would require one n = 4 sector with twelve supermultiplets). we
saw that, in order to eectively reduce the number of states, the d-operation must always
be inserted in at least two circles belonging to two dierent complex planes, which implies
that there are always at least two n = 4 sectors in which eight supermultiplets become
massive. as a consequence, the maximal number nv + nh of supermultiplets originating
from the twisted sectors, below the 48, which is reached only when all the shifts ~h, ~g and
the d-projections are turned o (all the modular coecients are +1), is 32, and is obtained
when nd = 1 and the d-projection involves only two dierent complex planes. this explains
why, in the classication of table d.1, there are no models with nv +nh between 48 and 32.
for an analogous reason, also nv + nh = 28 is forbidden: this would require one more d-
projection, reducing further the number of states in only one n = 4 sector, but it is easy to
realize that in order to reduce the number of supermultiplets to four, the two d-projections
must be inserted in at least four dierent circles, two per projection. there are therefore
always at least two n = 4 sectors with 4 supermultiplets, so that, below 32, the maximal
number of supermultiplets is 24. below this, all the numbers modulo 4 are allowed:
it is
possible to construct models with nv + nh = 20, 16, 12, 8, 4, 0. one can check that these
are precisely the numbers that appear in the list of table d.1. in section 4.2 we will also
see how the operations described above can be interpreted in terms of stringy (super-)higgs
mechanisms.

4. helicity supertraces and (super-)higgs phenomena

when specied for a certain model, formula (3.21) encodes, in principle, all the perturbative
information about it. it can be used to investigate the bps spectrum and to compute one-
loop threshold corrections. in each model, all the non-trivial moduli dependence is contained
in the three n = 4 sectors, so that essentially the classication of z2z2 symmetric orbifolds
amounts to assigning the three n = 4 sectors for each one of the massless spectra appearing in
table d.1. according to the analysis of section 3, this is equivalent to specifying the form of
the lattice sum, (i)
2,2)
then xes unambiguously the entire partition function. actually, as far as we are interested
only in the n = 4 sectors, the notation (3.14) is highly redundant, because the shifts and
the d-projections are constrained, in each (h, g)-twisted sector, to be either (0, 0) or equal
to (h, g). it is therefore sucient to specify the direction and the nature of the translations
through a pair of lattice vectors, w1 and w2 (see appendix e). we can then account for the

4.1. helicity supertraces

we are interested in the second and fourth helicity supertraces, b2 and b4, through which we
control the behaviour of a model under a motion in moduli space. the helicity supertraces
are dened, for a given representation r of supersymmetry, as
b2n(r)  str2n = trr[()22n],

where  stands for the physical four-dimensional helicity. in the framework of string theory,

in agreement with the supergravity computation, for which the gravity multiplet, as well
as a vector multiplet, contribute +1, while a hypermultiplet and a hypertensor multiplet
(the multiplet that contains the dilaton) contribute 1. in this way the contribution of the
untwisted sector cancels, leaving precisely the dierence between the number of vector and

13

hypermultiplets coming from the twisted sectors. the result (4.17) also shows that, for the
symmetric constructions we are considering, the contribution of the massive short multiplets
sums up to zero6.

it is also easy to see that b4, which counts the number of short multiplets,

b4 = (q + q)4 z string(v, v)|v=v=0 ,

(4.18)

receives contributions from both the n = 2 and the n = 4 sectors. the contribution of the
n = 2 sector is due to the term 4(q3 q + q q3) z string(v, v)|v=v=0 in the expansion of (4.18),
and in the models we are considering it turns out to be equal to b2, while the contribution
of the n = 4 sectors is due to the term 6q2 q2 z string(v, v)|v=v=0. the contribution of each
n = 4 sector is easily computed:

since the threshold corrections in general are expressed in terms of integrals over the fun-
damental domain of torus partition functions, for later convenience we quote in appendix e
also the integrals of the various z2,2(x).

4.2. higgs and super-higgs phenomena

it is a general property of shifted lattices, w
in moduli space in which, for (h, g) = (1, 0) or (1, 1), the lattice sum vanishes (for a
detailed account, see for instance [22]). the particular limit(s) at which this happens depends
on the shift vector w, and, once specied the modular properties of the lattice sum, the
6the contribution of a short massive multiplet sj of spin j is b2(sj) = ()2j+1(2j + 1), so that (4.17)

2,2(cid:2)h
g(cid:3), that there is always at least one corner

puts constraints on the ratios of the numbers of massive short multiplets of integer and half-integer spin.

14

various situations, which dier in the choice of w, are mapped into one another by sl(2, z)
transformations performed on the toroidal moduli t and u (see for instance [22]). the
vanishing of the lattice sum at a particular limit means that the states originating from the
(h, g)-twisted sector become innitely massive and decouple from the spectrum.
in this
limit the unprojected theory is recovered.

this phenomenon is reected in the behaviour of b4, as it appears from eq. (4.19). the
contribution of a given n = 4 sector vanishes completely in an appropriate limit in the (t, u)
space when x is given by expression (4.2) or (4.3), namely when the z2 projection which
breaks supersymmetry acts freely in that sector. in the cases (4.4) and (4.5), instead, there is
a decoupling of respectively one-half and three-quarters of the states of the twisted sector. in
some cases, in the limit in which the states with shifted mass decouple from the spectrum,
there is also an associated eective restoration of a certain number of supersymmetries
[11, 23]. in this case, the decoupling of some states is accompanied by the appearance of
new massless states, which t into multiplets of the enlarged supersymmetry. this happens
in the limits in which one or both of the z2(b) projections eectively vanish. we can therefore
restore four or even eight supersymmetries. a necessary condition for the existence of a limit
of restoration of n = 4 supersymmetry is the vanishing of b2. in this limit, b4 receives a
non-zero contribution only from one n = 4 sector of the orbifold. when there is a restoration
of n = 8, also the massless contribution to b4 must vanish. as is clear from our formulae,
however, this implies the full vanishing of this helicity supertrace.

5. perturbative and non-perturbative dualities

the knowledge of the partition function allows us to analyse many properties of the string
constructions. in this section we consider perturbative and non-perturbative stringstring
dualities.

5.1. mirror symmetry from the partition function

in appendix b.2 we illustrate how to pass from type iia to type iib in the framework of the
fermionic construction. here we want to show how mirror symmetry, namely the statement
that the type iia string compactied on the calabiyau manifold m is equivalent to the
type iib string compactied on the mirror manifold m 7, can be easily read o at the orbifold
points we are considering. in order to see this, we start by going to the fermionic point of
the moduli space of the orbifolds. at such a point, as we saw, the operation of passing from
a space m to the mirror m is implemented by a change in the modular coecient c(b1|b2),
which is responsible for the sign of b2 = nv nh = /2. on the other hand, passing from
iia to iib requires the changes quoted in appendix b.2, which involve also a change of sign
of b2. when combined, the two operations of exchanging iia with iib and m with m leave
b2 invariant and exchange t i with u i in b4. however, at the level of the partition function,
such an exchange simply amounts to a dierent choice of the vectors w, which specify, for

7see for instance [24].

15

in particular, we can
each plane, the lattice shifts. the initial choice of w is arbitrary.
choose w in such a way that the quantities (4.1)(4.5), which encode all the non-trivial
moduli dependence of the models, are invariant under the exchange of t with u: all the
other choices are related to that by sl(2, z) transformations in t and/or u. we therefore
see that, modulo sl(2, z) transformations, b2 and b4 are invariant under mirror symmetry.
to conclude that this is a perturbative symmetry of the theory, it is then sucient to observe
that the pair (b2, b4) is in a one-to-one correspondence with the partition function. this
means that this pair uniquely determines the model, encoding all the perturbative physics
at any order of perturbation.

5.2. stringstring u-dualities

the non-perturbative dualities we consider here are stringstring u-dualities, which relate
the type iia orbifolds to heterotic or type ii duals. the type ii duals are constructed as
asymmetric orbifolds in which the n = 2 supersymmetry is realized only among left-movers.
as for the heterotic constructions, also in these type ii orbifolds the dilatonaxion eld
belongs to the vector manifold (see appendix b.3); it is exchanged by u-duality with one
of the moduli of the vector manifold of the type iia duals. this kind of duality is therefore
much similar to the duality between type iia and heterotic strings.
in the case of the
heterotic/type iia duality, a necessary condition for the identication of the moduli is the
compactication of the type iia string on a k3 bration [16]. when the conformal eld
theory can be explicitly solved, as in our z2  z2 orbifolds, this requirement translates into
the property of spontaneous breaking of the n = 4 supersymmetry, in the sense we described
above8.

therefore the models that are orbifold limits of k3 brations are the following:

(8, 8)

(4, 4)

(2, 2)

(0, 0)

(o, f, f )

(d, f d, f )

(dd, f d, f )

(f, f, f )
(f d, f d, f )

(5.1)

(here f  stands for f as well as for f d). the heterotic duals of the rst three models were

8 the connection relies on the fact that in the limit of large volume of the compact space, any k3
bration looks locally like c  k3. this means that locally, an observer sitting on a point of the base sees
16 supercharges, as in the t 2  k3 compactication, instead of 8. the extra 8 supercharges are projected
out by global, not local, projection. in the case of z2  z2 orbifolds, the k3 is described by the orbifold
limit t 4/z2: the z2  z2 orbifolds which correspond to k3 brations are those for which, in some corner of
the moduli t , u , which always corresponds to the decompactication of some dimensions, one of the two z2
projections can be made to eectively vanish, thereby recovering a t 2  t 4/z2, n = 4 orbifold. in all such
models, the n = 2 and n = 4 phases are continuously related by a change of size, or shape, of the compact
space. the n = 4 phase is reached when at least one dimension is decompactied.

16

considered in [17, 18, 25]. the model (0, 0) is special, possessing also a spontaneously broken
n = 8 supersymmetry. the detailed study of this last model has been considered in [19].

in the case of type iia/type ii asymmetric orbifold duality, on which we will concentrate
in the following, the recipe is not the compactication on a k3 bration (or some of its
orbifold limits). however, the type iia/heterotic u-duality can be tested by looking at
the renormalization of certain terms in the eective action.
in [18], a particular linear
combination of r2 and ff  terms, smooth and analytic in the full space of moduli t and
u, was shown to be appropriate for a comparison of type iia and heterotic constructions.
the same combination of gravitational and gauge eld-strengths can be used here as a
guideline in the search of type iia/type ii asymmetric dual pairs. actually, since in the
type ii constructions all the gauge bosons are ramondramond states, the above amplitude
turns out to coincide with the r2 term alone. as it happens for the type iia, also in the
type ii asymmetric orbifold constructions the genus zero contribution to this term vanishes.
in the type ii eective action there is therefore no bare coupling constant, and the dilaton
contribution is only non-perturbative and exponentially suppressed. such a behaviour is
reproduced on type iia by the moduli t i of the planes denoted, in our convention, by f or
f d. their contribution to the renormalization of the r2 term is therefore

log im t |4 (t )|4  log im t ( 0) + o(cid:0)eit(cid:1)

(|t|  ) .

(5.2)

the mild logarithmic divergence is an infrared artefact and can be lifted by switching on an
appropriate cut-o (these planes behave in fact like the planes shifted by the projection that
spontaneously breaks the supersymmetry in the models of refs. [12, 18, 19].)

once the plane whose kahler class modulus t is mapped into the dilaton eld of the
asymmetric orbifold has been identied, the contribution of the moduli of the remaining
planes has to match the contribution of the perturbative vector multiplet moduli in the type
ii asymmetric orbifold. it turns out that the models that possess such an asymmetric dual
construction are

(16, 16)

(f, o, o)

(8, 8)

(4, 4)

(0, 0)

(f , d, d)

(f , dd, dd)

(f, f, f )
(f , f d, f d) .

(5.3)

among these, a special role is still played by the model (0, 0), which therefore possesses both
a heterotic and a type ii asymmetric dual. in this model, one of the moduli t is mapped in
the dilaton of the asymmetric construction and in the inverse of the dilaton of the heterotic
dual (in the limit t  0, (5.2) shows up a linear behaviour in t  1/t , which matches
the tree level
g2  im s correction on the heterotic side [19]). since this modulus plays
the role of a higgs eld for the spontaneous breaking of some of the supersymmetries in the
type iia orbifold, we learn through the duality map that there is, on the heterotic side, a
non-perturbative spontaneous breaking of an n = 8 supersymmetry [19]. similar arguments

1

17

can be applied to the rst three models of (5.3), namely the constructions with (nv , nh ) =
(16, 16), (8, 8) and (4, 4), which we analyse here in detail. it is possible to show that also in
such models there is a non-perturbative super-higgs phenomenon. the dependence on the
dilaton sii, in these cases, can be obtained by looking at the asymmetric duals. the dual
of sii is in fact a perturbative modulus belonging to a hypermultiplet, whose dependence is
explicit in the asymmetric constructions; it is not dicult to identify the latter with one of the
super-higgs elds responsible for the spontaneous breaking of some of the supersymmetries.
through the duality between symmetric and asymmetric orbifolds, we therefore learn that,
in the strong coupling limit, these type iia orbifolds have an approximate restoration of a
n = 4 supersymmetry.

in order to see the above issues in detail, we start by discussing the type iia orbifolds.

in order to obtain the gravitational corrections, we proceed as in [18, 19]: the four derivative
gravitational corrections we will consider are precisely those that were analysed in the frame-
work of n = 4 ground states of ref. [12] and the n = 2 ground states of refs. [18, 19]. there
is no tree-level contribution to these operators, and the r2 correction is related to the inser-
tion of the two-dimensional operator 222 in the one-loop partition function. in the models
at hand, since supersymmetry is realized symmetrically and nv = nh , the contribution of

the n = 2 sector to b4 vanishes, and (cid:10)222(cid:11) is identied with b4/3. the massless contri-
butions of the latter give rise to an infrared logarithmic behaviour 2bii log[m (iia) 2/(iia) 2]
[26, 28], where m (iia)  1
is the type iia string scale and (iia) is the type iia infrared
cut-o. besides this running, the one-loop correction contains the thresholds iia, which
account for the innite tower of string modes.

iia

the one-loop corrections of the r2-term are then related to the infrared-regularized
genus-one integral of b4/3. in the type iia string, these r2 corrections depend on the kahler
moduli (spanning the vector manifold), and are independent of the complex-structure moduli
(spanning the scalar manifold):

in the last model, nv = nh = 4, if the semi-freely acting projection on the third complex
plane is a product of d- instead of d-operations we obtain:

notice that, except for the planes 2 and 3 of model nv = 16, the shifts on the (i)
2,2 lattices
break the sl(2, z)t i duality groups. as in [18, 19], the actual subgroup left unbroken
depends on the kind of shifts performed (see refs.
[12, 22, 23]). all the above corrections
diverge linearly, in both the large and small t 2 and t 3 limits. on the other hand, the
contribution of t 1 diverges only logarithmically in the large- im t 1 limit, and linearly in
the inverse modulus t = 1/t 1, for small t 1. as we previously discussed, the logarithmic
divergence is an infrared artefact and can be removed by switching on an appropriate cut-o.

5.3. the type ii asymmetric duals

and z (o)

2 . z (f )

we now discuss the type ii asymmetric dual orbifolds. the model nv = nh = 16 is
constructed starting from the n = 8 iia superstring compactied on t 6 and applying two
projections: z (f )
acts freely, as ()fr together with a translation on t 6,
and projects out all the left-moving supersymmetries. z (o)
2 , instead, acts as a rotation that
reduces symmetrically the number of supersymmetries by 1/2. the properties of the n = 4
models obtained by applying only z (f )
2 were already analysed in [12]. the orbifold obtained
by the further application of z (o)
2 has an n = 2 supersymmetry, which is realized only among
left-movers. the partition function of the model reads

from which we derive nv = nh = 16. the massless spectrum therefore contains, besides the
supergravity multiplet, 3+16 vector multiplets and 4+16 hypermultiplets: it is therefore the
same as that of the type iia model nv = 16. however, here the dilaton belongs to a vector
multiplet. this is a general property of all the n = 2 string compactications in which all
the supersymmetries are realized either between only left or between only right movers, such
as the heterotic strings or type ii asymmetric orbifolds as the ones we consider. the reason
is that the dilaton, in such cases, is uncharged under the su(2) operators that rotate the
supercharges of the n = 2 supergravity10.

the nv = nh = 8 orbifold is constructed by modding out the previous model with a
projection, which acts semi-freely. the partition function of this orbifold is

owing to the free action of z fr

2 , all these models possess a spontaneously broken n = 4 =
(2, 2) supersymmetry, restored in the limit in which the projection z fr
2 becomes irrelevant:
this phenomenon takes place for special values of the moduli belonging to hypermultiplets.
we remark that in all these models b2  0. as a consequence there are no points in the
moduli space in which there appear n = 2, nv 6= nh singularities.

as in the case of the type iia orbifolds, also in the asymmetric duals the r2 gravitational
corrections receive a contribution only from one loop, and are obtained by the insertion of
the operator 2

5.4. comparison of symmetric and asymmetric orbifolds

we now come to the comparison of the type iia symmetric and the type ii asymmetric
orbifolds. as is clear from expressions (5.13)(5.16) and the analogous (5.27)(5.29) for the
asymmetric orbifolds, for any type iia symmetric orbifold it is possible to choose actions
of the d-projections that can be reproduced in the type ii asymmetric orbifolds, leading to
the same corrections nv : nv (t 2, t 3) = nv (t as, u as). a comparison of the corrections
with the r2 term therefore leads to the following identication of the moduli in the vector
manifold: t 2 = t as, t 3 = u as. these moduli are perturbative in both the constructions. on
the other hand, the contribution of the modulus t 1 in (5.12), in the limit t 1  , diverges
only logarithmically. this is consistent with the vanishing of the perturbative, genus-zero
(o(sas)) contribution to this term in the type ii asymmetric orbifolds. we are therefore led
to identify this modulus with the dilatonaxion eld  as
s  4sas of the asymmetric orbifolds
[12, 19]. the logarithmic behaviour is then interpreted as a non-perturbative eect.

we remark that the identication of the perturbative moduli is possible only for special
choices of the translations introduced by the d-projections. the reason is that it is not
always possible to reconstruct the properties of the kahler class moduli of a product of two
tori, whose lattice of momenta and windings is shifted by the action of the d-projections,
with the kahler class and complex structure moduli of a single torus with shifted lattice:
dierent translations correspond to dierent cuts in the moduli space of the model, and
not all the cuts correspond to dual constructions. however, we learned that a correct cut
exists, and the identication of (t 2, t 3) with (t as, u as) provides a test of the duality. the
corrections computed in the type iia symmetric orbifolds therefore provide the full, pertur-
bative and non-perturbative, corrections for the asymmetric orbifolds. these are given by
the expression (5.12), in which
i) the moduli t 1, t 2 are replaced by t as, u as,
ii) the modulus t 1 is replaced by the dilaton 4sas,
iii) the type iia string mass and cut-o have to be replaced by those of the type ii asym-
metric theory. indeed, we are using a regularization scheme for which the ratio of the mass
and the cut-o is duality-independent, and can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the
plank mass and a physical cut-o :

m (iia)
(iia) =

m (as)
(as) =

mplanck



.

(5.30)

this duality also provides, on the other hand, a window on the non-perturbative physics
of the type iia orbifolds. as we already pointed out, in the above type iia orbifolds
supersymmetry is broken in a rigid way; namely, it is not possible to restore some of the
broken supersymmetries by taking some special limit in the moduli of the compact space.
this has to be contrasted with the situation of the type ii asymmetric dual orbifolds, in which
instead the asymmetric projection z fr
acts freely, and it can be made to eectively vanish
by taking an appropriate limit in the moduli of the rst plane. these are hypermultiplet
moduli. in these orbifolds, the rst and the second plane provide four such moduli, that
correspond to the three hypermultiplet moduli u 1, u 2, u 3 and the dilaton sii of the type iia

2

orbifolds. three moduli are therefore perturbative in both the theories, and the mismatch in
the perturbative mechanism of spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry forces us to identify
the modulus of the asymmetric orbifolds, which plays the role of super-higgs eld as the dual
of the type iia dilaton. from the point of view of type iia, the mechanism of spontaneous
breaking of supersymmetry is then entirely non-perturbative.

6. conclusions

in this work we constructed and classied all the four-dimensional n = 2, z2z2 symmetric
orbifolds of the type iia/b superstring. after having constructed the models at the fermionic
point, according to the rules of the fermionic construction, we established the equivalence,
for this class of orbifolds, of world-sheet fermions and bosons, and we derived the partition
function of each model at a generic point in the space of the moduli of the three tori of
t 6 = t 2  t 2  t 2. through an analysis of some helicity supertraces, easily computable
from the partition function, we investigated the appearance of stringy higgs and super-
higgs phenomena, which served as a guideline in the search for heterotic and/or type ii
duals. we devoted particular attention to the study of the latter, for which we provided an
analysis analogous to that of the symmetric orbifolds. these pairs are related by a map that
exchanges the dilatonaxion eld of the type ii asymmetric construction for a perturbative
modulus of the type iia dual, associated to a vector multiplet. conversely, the type iia
dilaton is mapped into a perturbative modulus of the type ii asymmetric dual, associated
to a hypermultiplet. through the comparison of the corrections to the r2 term, we then
provided a test of this duality, obtaining also a prediction on the non-perturbative physics of
the type ii asymmetric models. on the other hand, we observed a perturbative super-higgs
mechanism on the type ii asymmetric models, unobservable on the perturbative type iia
duals, because it involves as super-higgs eld a modulus dual to the type iia dilaton.

appendix a: the type ii string in the free fermionic formulation

in the free fermionic formulation of string theory [2][4] the string degrees of freedom are
expressed in terms of free world-sheet fermions. for the four-dimensional type ii string and
in the light cone-gauge theory these fermions are [5]:

 the space-time degrees of freedom

 the internal degrees of freedom

left : zx(z, z), l
right :zx(z, z), r

i (z), yl

left : l
right : r

i (z), l

i (z)
i (z), r

i (z)

i (z), yr

, i = 1, . . . 6.

the world-sheet supersymmetry, necessary for a consistent theory, is realized in the usual
way among the space-time coordinates and non-linearly among the internal coordinates [29]

f a = abcf bf c ,

f  {l

i , yl

i , l

i , i = 1 . . . 6} ,

where  is a grassmann eld and abc are the properly normalised structure constants of a
lie algebra g = gl

w and similarly for right movers g = gr
w .

it is known that the transportation properties of fermionic elds on surfaces with non-
trivial topology, such as the string world-sheet, are not completely determined by the two-
dimensional metric and an extra information must be supplied. this information is known
as spin structure and describes the phases emerging when each fermionic eld moves around
a non-contractible circle of the surface. spin structures are in principle arbitrary, but a
consistent string model should satisfy a set of physical requirements:

(i) multiloop modular invariance,

(ii) factorisation of physical amplitudes,

(iii) global existence of left and right supercurrents.

after imposing these constraints much freedom is left in choosing spin structures and a very
big number of consistent string models can be obtained.

if we restrict ourselves to periodicantiperiodic fermionic elds, and demand space-time
supersymmetry to emerge symmetrically from left and right movers (which means that left
and right space-time fermions will be treated symmetrically), the choice of the internal
fermion gauge groups (gl

w ) is essentially unique:

then the solution of the consistency constraints can be expressed in a simple set of rules for
constructing any type ii string model. a specic model is dened by

1) a set of boundary condition basis vectors {b1 = 1, . . . , bn}, which generate a set of 2n
boundary conditions vectors  :      = pn
i=1 mibi, mi = 0, 1. each boundary
condition vector bi has 40 entries11:
bi  {bi(), bi(1), . . . , bi(y1) . . . , bi(1) . . . ; bi( ), bi(1), . . . , bi(y1) . . . , bi(1) . . .}
where bi(f ) = 0, 1 correspond to the transportation properties of each fermion f 
eibi(f ). the basis vectors are subject to some restrictions, namely
1. bi  bi = mod 8 , i = 0, . . . , n,
2. bi  bj = mod 4 , i 6= 0 = 1, . . . , n,
3. qf bi(f )bj(f )bk(f )b(f ) = 0 mod 2 , i6=j6=k6= = 0, . . . , n,
4. |{bi(i), bi(yi), bi(i)}|2 = bi() mod 2 ,
|{bi( i), bi(yi), bi(i)}|2 = bi( ) mod 2 ,  a = 1, . . . , 6 and  i = 0, . . . , n.

along the paper, we have used indierently two equivalent notations for the operation of
composition of fermion sets: the sum, as here, which is more convenient when we specify the
fermion sets through the boundary conditions they assign, and the symmetric dierence
(see [3]), indicated as a product of sets, which contains the union of two fermion sets minus
their intersection, and is more convenient when, as in many sections of the paper, we specify
the periodic fermions contained in the various sets.

appendix b: massless spectrum and vertex operators

b.1. z2  z2 orbifolds in the fermionic construction
we write here the vertex operator representation of the massless states of the z2z2 orbifold
constructed in section 2. the massless states of the untwisted sector come from the ns-
ns, r-ns, ns-r and rr sectors, which are given, in our convention, by the sectors  (the
vacuum), s, s and s s respectively. in order to describe the physical states, we introduce
the su(2), r-parity currents e i

2 h i, h i, i = 0, 1, 2, 3 12, where:

2 hi, hi, e i

h0 = l

(b.1)

(the eigenvalues of h0 and h 0 give the space-time spin). the fermions originate from the
s and s sectors. they are two gravitinos, represented, in the 1/2-picture, by

e i

e i

2 (2 h0+h0+h1+h2+h3) ;

two dilatinos:

and twelve spin-1/2 fermions:

decomposed: x = h + h.

(b.5)

(b.6)
the bosons originate from the sectors  and s s. the vacuum sector  contains the graviton
ei(h0+ h0), the pair dilatonpseudoscalar ei(h0 h0), and the six complex scalars ei(hi hi).
from the vertex operator representation of the graviton and the gravitinos we read o the
generators of the n = 2 supersymmetry:

2 (h0h1h2+h3),

q = e i

2 (h0h1h2h3)

and

q = e i

2 ( h0 h1 h2 h3) ,

(b.7)

from which we derive also the expressions of the generators of the n = 2, su(2) algebra:
j +, j  ( j +) and j 0, whose charge operator i 0 is given by:

i 0 =

1

2i (h0  h1  h2  h3) 

1

2i (h0  h1  h2  h3).

it is then easy to see that the dilaton-pseudoscalar
ei(h0 h0) ,

and the three complex scalars

ei(hi hi)

i = 1, 2, 3,

(b.8)

(b.9)

(b.10)

carry a non-zero i 0 charge: they therefore belong to hypermultiplets. since we are consider-
ing a type iia orbifold, the three complex scalars (b.10) correspond to the complex structure
moduli u i of the three tori of the internal space. the three complex scalars

ei(hi+ hi)

i = 1, 2, 3,

(b.11)

have no i 0 charge and are superpartners of the vectors: they therefore correspond to the
three kahler class moduli t i. the s s sector contains four complex scalars, which carry i 0
charge:

and four vectors:

e i
e i
e i
e i

2 (h0+h1+h2+h3 h0 h1 h2 h3) ,
2 (h0h1h2+h3 h0+ h1+ h2 h3) ,
2 (h0h1+h2h3 h0+ h1 h2+ h3) ,
2 (h0+h1h2h3 h0 h1+ h2+ h3) ,

e i
e i
e i
e i

2 (h0+h1+h2+h3+ h0+ h1+ h2+ h3) ,
2 (h0h1h2+h3+ h0 h1 h2+ h3) ,
2 (h0h1+h2h3+ h0 h1+ h2 h3) ,
2 (h0+h1h2h3+ h0+ h1 h2 h3) .

(b.12)

(b.13)

it is easy to recognise that the rst vector belongs to the gravity multiplet, being obtained
by applying twice the supersymmetry generators to the graviton.

28

b.2. iia versus iib in the fermionic language

the type iiab exchange is realized by changing the chirality of, say, the right-moving
in the fermionic construction this is implemented by the following changes with
spinors.
respect to the type iia choice of table 2.1: c( s| s)  +1, c( s|f )  1, c( s|b11)  1,
c( s|b22)  1. under this exchange, the right-moving supersymmetry generator becomes:
(b.14)

2 ( h0+ h1+ h2+ h3) .

q  e i

as a consequence, the su(2) cartan charge operator i 0 is now:

i 0 =

1

2i (h0  h1  h2  h3) 

1

2i (h0 + h1 + h2 + h3) .

(b.15)

in this case the states that are associated, in the type iia construction, to the complex
scalars t 1, t 2, t 3, given in (b.11), now carry i 0 charge, while those associated to the three
complex scalars u 1, u 2, u 3, given in (b.10), do not. the role of t i and u i is therefore
exchanged, as expected. a change in the sign of c(b11|b22) exchanges nv and nh. this then
changes the sign of the euler characteristic of the compact space,  = 2(nh  nv ).

b.3. massless states of type ii asymmetric orbifolds

the analysis of the massless spectrum of the asymmetric orbifolds discussed in section 5 can
be performed in a similar way, by going to the fermionic point. we quote here the vertices
for the bosonic massless states of the untwisted sectors: (h f, gf), (h o, go) equal to (0, 0)
or (0, 1). they are:

ei(h0+ h0)
ei(h0 h0)
ei(hi hj ),
h3,
eih0e i
ei(h3 h3)

2

i, j = 1, 2
eih3ei h0

(graviton)
(dilaton, pseudoscalar)
(hyperscalars)
(graviphoton, vectors)
(vectorscalars)

(b.16)

in particular, we notice that, although the dilaton is represented by the same vertex operator
as the dilaton of the type iia orbifolds, eq. (b.9), in this case it is uncharged under the
su(2) symmetry of the n = 2 superalgebra. the analogous of the operators q and q, eq.
(b.7), are in fact in this case:

q+, q = e i

2 (h0+h1h2h3) ,

(b.17)

where  takes the values 1 and depends on the (immaterial) choice of the chirality of the
spinors. the analogous of the operator i 0 is therefore

i 0

as =i (h2 + h3) .

29

(b.18)

appendix c: gso projections on the twisted sectors

we quote here the contribution to the quantity 4(nv  nh), as a function of the modular
coecients, of each one of the 48 twisted supersectors. by supersector we mean a twisted
sector and the sectors derived from it by addition of the sets s, s, s s, which provide the
supersymmetric partners. for simplicity, we omit to indicate the latter, so that b1 is a short-
hand notation for the sets b1, sb1, sb1, s sb1. the quantity 4(nv + nh ) is given by the
product of the two square brackets.

in the previous expressions, all the modular coecients are symmetric under the exchange

of the arguments: c(|) = c(|). we dened also:

 = c(b1|f )c(b1|e3)c(b1|e4),
 = c(b2|f )c(b2|e1)c(b2|e2),
 = c(b1|e5)c(b2|e5).

(c.49)

by running the above formulae with a computer program, we nd the following pairs of
(nv , nh): (0, 48), (48, 0), (28, 4), (4, 28), (16, 16), (0, 24), (24, 0), (6, 18), (18, 6), (12, 12),

the formulae above simplify if, instead of factorizing the boundary conditions of the six
circles with the sets ei, i = 1, ..., 5, we consider only the factorization of the three tori (1, 2),
(3, 4) and (5, 6) with the sets ti, i = 1, 2, 3, given by:

in this case, we can only nd a subset of models, namely those with (nv , nh) = (48, 0),
(0, 48), (24, 0), (0, 24), (16, 16), (12, 12), (8, 8) and (0, 0).

c.1. a choice of modular coecients for each model

we give here a choice of modular coecients per each one of the constructions of section 5:

1) (48,0). all coecients = +1.

2) (28,4). (d, d, o): c(e1|e3), c(e1|e4), c(e2|e3), c(e2|e4) = 1.

3) (16,16). (o, o, f ): c(b1|f ) = 1.

4) (24,0). (d, d, d): c(e2|e5), c(e4|e5) = 1.

5) (18,6). (dd, dd, o): c(e1|e2), c(e1|e4), c(e2|e3), c(e3|e4) = 1.

6) (12,12). (r, o, f d): c(e1|e2),  = 1.
(d, d, d): c(e1|e2), c(e3|e4) = 1.

7) (16,4). (dd, d, d): c(e1|e2), c(e2|e4) = 1.

8) (14,2). (dd, dd, d): c(e1|e4), c(e2|e3) = 1.

(d, d, f ): c(e1|e3), c(e1|e4), c(e2|e3), c(e3|e4),  = 1. (d, d, f d): c(e1|e3),  = 1.
(o, f, f ): c(b2|e3). (o, f d, f d): c(b2|e3), c(e4|e5) = 1.

10) (12,0). (dd, dd, dd): c(e1|e5), c(e2|e4), c(e3|e5) = 1.

11) (6,6). (dd, dd, dd): c(e1|e2), c(e2|e5), c(e3|e4), c(e4|e5) = 1.
(dd, d, f d): c(e1|e2), c(e2|e4),  = 1.

12) (9,3). (rr, rr, rr): c(e1|e2), c(e2|e4), c(e3|e4), c(e3|e5), ,  = 1.

13) (4,4). (d, f d, f ): c(b2|e3), c(e1|e3), c(e1|e4), c(e2|e3), c(e2|e4) = 1. (d, f d, f d):

c(b2|e3), c(e2|e5), c(e4|e5),  = 1.

(dd, dd, f ): c(e1|e2), c(e1|e4), c(e2|e3), c(e3|e4),  = 1. (dd, dd, f d): c(e1|e3), c(e2|e4),

 = 1.

14) (2,2). (dd, f d, f d): c(b2|e4), c(e1|e2), c(e2|e3),  = 1.

15) (0,0). (f, f, f ): c(b1|e1), c(b2|e3),  = 1. (f d, f d, f ): c(b1|e1), c(b2|e3), c(e1|e3),
c(e1|e4), c(e2|e3), c(e2|e4),  = 1. (f d, f d, f d): c(b1|e1), c(b2|e3), c(e2|e5), c(e4|e5),  = 1.

c.2. reading the (super-)higgs mechanism directly from (c.1)(c.48)

in section 3 we saw how it is possible to interpret the gso projections of the fermionic
construction in terms of lattice shifts and twists and, in the light of the previous analysis, we
are also able to understand them in terms of higgs and super-higgs mechanisms. the higgs
mechanism is present whenever there are shifts due to modular coecients c(ei|ej) = 1:
they translate in fact into d projections. there is a super-higgs mechanism when there is a
shift due to modular coecients c(bi|ej) = 1 and/or c(bi|f ) = 1 (by symmetric dierence,
the set f can be seen to assign the boundary conditions of the sixth circle of t 6, which in
the notation of section 3, eq. (3.5), are (, )). according to this interpretation, we see
that the missing massless states still belong to the string spectrum, and there are corners in
moduli space in which some or all of them become massless. on each n = 4 sector, besides
the gso projection that reduces the number of states, starting from a maximum of sixteen,
there is also in action a gso projection on the world-sheet chiralities, which determines
whether such states are hyper- or vector multiplets. by looking at formulae (c.1)(c.48),
which express the quantity nv  nh for each one of the 48 twisted (super)sectors, we can
see that in each sector the gso projection splits into a product of three factors: the rst
two factors, which determine whether a given twisted supersector provides massless states or
not, can be translated in terms of lattice shifts. the modular coecients entering the rst
factor in square brackets determine the shift in the rst circle of the corresponding untwisted
torus, while the shift in the second circle is determined by the coecients entering the second
square brackets. the product of coecients after the square brackets translates into a shift
in the twisted t 4. a shift on a twisted lattice is directly related to the sign of nv  nh . the
coecients inside the square brackets therefore determine whether such states are massless
or massive, while the coecients out of the square brackets determine whether the massless
states are hyper- or vector multiplets.

appendix d: classication of partition functions

the classication of the partition functions can be easily carried out by observing that
the situations listed in (4.1), (4.2), (4.4) and (4.5) are in a one-to-one correspondence with
the number of massless multiplets, no matter whether they are hypermultiplets or vector-

36

multiplets, of the corresponding twisted sector. the classication of partitions functions
therefore amounts essentially to a complete account of these numbers. there is, however,
a subtlety, because this method does not allow a distinction between (4.2) and (4.3). in
fact, d can always be superposed to f , but not all the combinations are allowed,
because the insertion of d makes sense only when it involves at least two circles belonging
to two dierent tori. the result is shown in table d.1.
in this table we did not quote
the constructions that dier from the above by an exchange of nv and nh and/or by a
permutation of the three planes.

from table d.1, it easy to readread the number of supersymmetries that are sponta-
neously broken. when the free action of a susy-breaking projection appears in at most one
plane (indicated by f or f d), there is no spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry. when
the free action involves two planes, there is a spontaneous breaking of n = 4. when nally
the free action involves all the three planes, there is spontaneous breaking of n = 8.

where the shifts h and projections g take the values 0 or 1. here, w denotes the shift vector
with components (a1, a2, b1, b2) and   (m1, m2, n1, n2). we have also introduced the inner
product13
(e.2)

  w = ~m~b + ~a~n , w2 = 2~a~b ,

so that ai generates a winding shift in the i direction, whereas bi shifts the ith momentum.
the vector  is associated to the 2,2 lattice and therefore the vector associated to the shifted

13for w1 =(cid:16)~a1,~b1(cid:17) and w2 =(cid:16)~a2,~b2(cid:17), the inner product is dened as w1  w2 = ~a1~b2 + ~a2~b1.

39

from expressions (e.1) we learn that the integers ai and bi are dened modulo 2, in the
sense that adding 2 to any one of them amounts at most to a change of sign in z w
a modication is necessarily compensated by an appropriate one in the rest of the partition
function, in order to ensure modular invariance; we are thus left with the same model. on
the other hand, adding 2 to ai or bi translates into adding a multiple of 2 to . therefore,
although  can be any integer, only  = 0 and  = 1 correspond to truly dierent situations.
only when  = 0, is the (2,2) block modular invariant by itself, when the sum over (h, g) is
taken.

where w12  w1 + w2 reects the action of the diagonal z2. we refer to appendix c of [12]
for a detailed discussion of target space duality. one of the issues, valid when  = 0, our
case of interest, is that a change in the lattice vector w, which preserves modular invariance
(i.e. w2/2 = 0 mod2), amounts to an sl(2, z) transformation performed on t and/or u,
and vice versa. we can therefore x the lattice shift vectors and then derive the general
result by sl(2, z) transformations. if we choose w1 = (0, 0, 1, 0), w2 = (0, 0, 0, 1), the rst
z2 translates the momenta of the rst circle (insertion of (1)m1), the second z2 translates
the momenta of the second (insertion of (1)m2) 14. in this case the lattice sum reads:

by performing a poisson resummation over the momenta (m1, m2), we can express the shifted
lattice in the lagrangian formulation. when w = (w1, w2) = ((0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1)), we have

for the other cases, given in eqs. (4.3)-(4.5), the integral is obtained by taking the proper

in expression (e.26), the rst term is due to the integration of a lattice with only one z2
shift, w = (w1, 0), and the dependence of the pairs (i, j) on w1 is given in table e.1. the
second term is due to the integration of a lattice with a shift specied by w = w1 + w2,
where w1 is the same as in the rst term and w2 is a vector in an independent direction.
modular invariance requires w2
1 = (w1 + w2)2 = 0. the pair (k, ) can be anyone of table
e.1, with the only constraint (k, ) 6= (i, j).

in the case of two z2 shifts, as in (e.28), there is a sum of three terms, a = 1, 2, 3, which
refer respectively to the shifts given by the vectors (w1, w2, w1 + w2). the requirement of
modular invariance reduces the number of possibilities to the following six:

appendix f: the helicity supertraces in the type ii asymmetric orbifolds

as we discussed in section 4, the helicity supertraces are dened in terms of the four-

dimensional helicity  as

b2n  str 2n .

(f. 1)

in the framework of string theory, the physical four-dimensional helicity is the sum of the
contributions of the left and right movers:  = l + r. the supertraces are computed by
acting on the helicity-generating partition function z(v, v) with the dierential operators

that represent l(cid:0)r(cid:1):

l =

1
2i

v ,

r = 

1
2i

v .

(f. 2)

in the type ii asymmetric orbifolds of section 5.3, the contribution of the right-moving
fermions cannot be cast directly in the form (4.14) (with h 2 = g2 = 0).
in order to
compute the helicity supertraces we must start from the expression

z f

r(cid:20)a, h o
b, go(cid:21) (v) =

()a+b+ab

4

b(cid:21) (v) (cid:20)a
(cid:20)a

b(cid:21) (cid:20)a + h o

b + go(cid:21) (cid:20)a  h o
b  go(cid:21) .

the helicity-generating partition function reads

z(v, v) =

instead of (h 1, g1).

l(cid:2)h o
go(cid:3) (v) is the same as expression (4.13), with h 2 = g2 = 0 and arguments (h o, go)

the helicity supertrace b2

the only non-vanishing contribution to b2 can originate from the sectors of the orbifold for
which (h o, go) 6= (0, 0). in these sectors, there is a constraint, coming from the twisted boson

43

character, which is non-vanishing only for (h f, gf) = (0, 0) or (h f, gf) = (h o, go). when
(h f, gf) = (0, 0), we get 1/2 of the contribution of one n = (2, 2) sector of the corresponding
type iia symmetric orbifolds, which is zero because of the non-complete saturation of the
fermion zero modes. when (h f, gf) = (h o, go), we get an identical contribution. in order
to see this, we redene the arguments in (f. 3) as:

a + h o  a ,

b + go  b .

(f. 5)

after this substitution, we use the riemann identity and recast the right-moving fermion
contribution

as

2 xa,b
 (cid:20)1

()a+b+ab+ago+bh o+h ogo (cid:20)a

2(cid:17) .

2(cid:17) (cid:20)1 + h o

v

(f. 6)

(f. 7)

also the contribution of this term therefore vanishes, due to the non-complete saturation of
the fermion zero modes.

the helicity supertrace b4

in these orbifolds, all the n = 4 sectors, namely:

1. the n = (4, 0) sector with (h o, go) = (0, 0),
2. the n = (2, 2) sector with (h o, go) 6= (0, 0) and (h f, gf) = (0, 0),
3. the n = (2, 2) sector with (h o, go) 6= (0, 0) and (h f, gf) = (h o, go),

contribute to b4. in the rst sector the contribution is given by h4
b(cid:21) 1

li =

li. we obtain
6,6(cid:20)h f, ~h d

gf, ~gd(cid:21) (f. 8)

(nd indicates the number of d-projections.) this expression is a series that starts with a
square-root pole:

a1 q 1

2 + a0 + . . .

(f. 9)

the term a0 gives the massless contribution, which turns out to be constant in the full
space of t as, u as, the moduli in the vector multiplets, but not in the space of the moduli
belonging to hypermultiplets. at a generic point in moduli space, we have a0 = 6. when
(h o, go) 6= (0, 0), b4 amounts to 6h2
ri. in this case, the arguments (h f, gf), as we saw,
are constrained. one therefore proceeds as for the computation of b2, by splitting the sum
over (h f, gf) into the two terms (h f, gf) = (0, 0) and (h f, gf) = (h o, go). after the
same substitution of variables as in (f. 5), one obtains that the contribution of each one of

l2

44

the two terms is equal to the contribution of one complex plane of the symmetric orbifold.
in these sectors, the arguments ( ~h d, ~gd) are constrained as well: (h d, gd) = (0, 0) or
(h d, gd) = (h o, go). one therefore gets the various expressions:

6h22i = 36(3)
= 12x(h,g)
