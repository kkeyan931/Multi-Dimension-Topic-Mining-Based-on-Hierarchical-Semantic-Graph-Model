abstract

in this paper we consturct several supersymmetric theories on ads5 background.
we discuss the proper denition of the killing equation for the symplectic majorana
spinors required in ads5 supersymmetric theories. we nd that the symplectic
killing spinor equation involves a matrix m in the usp(2n ) indices whose role was
not recognized previously. using the correct killing spinors we explicitly conrm
that the particle masses in the constructed theories agree with the predictions of
the ads/cft correspondence. finally, we establish correct o(d  1, 2) isometry
transformations required to keep the lagrangian invariant on adsd.

1 introduction

recent work on the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] has brought renewed interest in
the subject of supersymmetric eld theory in anti-de sitter space, particularly for ads5.
we have found that several basic questions are not clearly discussed in the literature,
and it is our aim to clarify them in the present paper. these questions include the
proper killing equation for the symplectic majorana spinor required in ads5 susy, and
the lagrangian and transformation rules for the su(n) gauge multiplet, the conformal
scalar multiplet, and the massive scalar multiplet.

it was a surprise to us that the symplectic killing spinor equation involves a matrix
m in the usp(2n) indices whose role was not recognized previously. it turns out that
m also enters the transformation rules and the lagrangian of the basic supermultiplets.
in this paper we will develop a full description of these basic supermultiplets on ads5
using the properly dened symplectic killing spinors.

in the body of the paper, we will work with a metric of (+,,   ,) signature unless

stated otherwise:

(1.1)
with this choice of metric, the ricci curvature is r = (d1)a2g. we give a summary
of results for the (, +,   , +) signature in appendix a. it is our hope that the results
in this paper will prove useful for developing further understanding of physics on ads5.

ds2 = e2ardxdx  dr2.

2 killing spinors on ads

it is known that in d = 5, 6, 7 mod 8 regular majorana fermions cannot be dened
[4]. instead, in these dimensions we can dene symplectic majorana fermions which are
spinors satisfying the following condition [4, 5, 6]:

i = c(i)t

where c is the charge conjugation matrix and
i  

i 0.

(2.1)

(2.2)

in general, i = 1, 2, . . . , 2n and the indices are raised and lowered with a symplectic
metric ij which obeys

in this paper, we will only be interested in a pair of symplectic majorana spinors, so
i = 1, 2 and

t = ,  = i.

(2.3)

(2.4)

is the symplectic metric which will be used throughout this paper. to simplify our
computations, we will only use objects with all the symplectic indices lowered by inserting
the symplectic metric explicitly, for example, i = jji = ijj. note that in our
convention,

ij = ji = ij.

(2.5)

because of denition (2.2), we will treat i as an object with its symplectic index down,
but will at times employ i notation to save space.

for the rest of this paper we will work in d = 5 unless explicitly stated otherwise.
because now the cliord algebra contains 5, the fierz transformations become simpler:

where

s

(4, 2; 3, 1) =

1 1 1
5 3 1
10 2 2

s
v

(4, 1; 3, 2)

(2.6)

s(a, b; c, d) = abcd
v(a, b; c, d) = abcd
t(a, b; c, d) =  1

2abcd.

(2.7)

another useful identity to keep in mind in 5 dimensions is the symplectic majorana ip
formula [5]

i12 . . . n1nj = 

j

nn1 . . . 21i

which written in our notation becomes

i 012 . . . n1nj = iljk


k0nn1 . . . 21l.

this formula comes about because the charge conjugation matrix, c, is such that

cc 1 = t
 ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

which is dierent from 4 dimensions where there is a minus sign on the right hand side
of the equation. because of that minus sign, a majorana killing spinor equation in 4
dimensions can be dened in a straightforward manner [7]:

d = i

a
2

.

(2.11)

note that because this equation satises the ricci identity (see eq. (2.14) below), it can
be interpreted as a killing equation in arbitrary dimension for a complex unconstrained
spinor, which was studied previously [8]. an extension of the above denition to 5
dimensions fails because the left hand side satises the symplectic majorana condition
(2.1) while the right hand side of the above equation does not, due to eq. (2.10). this

2

led us to consider a generalized form of the killing equation for the symplectic majorana
killing spinors:

di = imij

j,

(2.12)

a
2

where mij is an unknown 2  2 matrix, and d = ( + 1
2 abab). it is important
to note that this form of the symplectic killing spinor equation and the subsequent
supersymmetry transformations stemming from it are compatible with ads5 supergravity
transformation rules [6], although killing spinors were not discussed there. we obtain the
properties of the matrix mij by applying the ricci identity and the symplectic majorana
condition to eq. (2.12). using eqs. (2.1) and (2.10) yields a condition on mij, which
written in the matrix form becomes

m = m ,

(2.13)

where  is the symplectic metric. on the other hand, ricci identity yields

[d, d]i 

1
2

rababi = a2i = a2(m 2)ijj,

(2.14)

that is

m 2 = 1.

(2.15)

putting equations (2.13) and (2.15) together, we can easily obtain the most general form
of the matrix m:

m =  cos 

sin ei

sin ei  cos  ! = ~x  ~

(2.16)

where  and  are angles taking values between 0 and 2, and

~x = (sin  cos , sin  sin , cos ),

and ~ = (1, 2, 3) is a vector of pauli matrices. hence, matrix m can be interpreted as
an element of the lie algebra of usp(2). furthermore, it is easily seen that the killing
spinor equation (2.12) is usp(2)-covariant: take m to be an allowed matrix appearing in
eq. (2.12), then usp(2) rotate the killing spinors, 
i = uijj, and write new killing spinor
equation for the rotated spinors  we obtain the same form of killing spinor equation but
with a dierent matrix m  = u mu which satises both conditions (2.13) and (2.15),
hence giving us a valid killing spinor equation.

complex killing spinors on d-dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime adsd for arbitrary
d have been constructed before [8, 9]. they are solutions of eq. (2.11) and take the form
(see appendix a for conversion between signatures)

 = e

i

2 arr (cid:18)1 +

i
2

ax(1  ir)(cid:19) 0.

(2.17)

3

solution of equation (2.12) can easily be obtained from the solution (2.17) by substituting
mij for every  in eq. (2.17):

i = (cid:16)e

i

2 arm r(cid:17)ij(cid:18)jk +

i
2

ax(mjk  ijkr)(cid:19) k

(2.18)

where j is a pair of constant symplectic majorana spinors.

now, for each matrix m above, let us construct a dirac spinor as a linear combination
of the two symplectic majorana spinors . assume the most general relation between two
symplectic majorana spinors and a dirac spinor:

 = a1 + b2

(2.19)

with the unknown coecients a and b. to be consistent, eq. (2.19) should produce the
right equation for the dirac killing spinors, eq. (2.11), when combined with equation for
the symplectic majorana killing spinors, eq. (2.12). using eq. (2.16) we nd that this
condition is satised by the following normalized dirac spinor

 = ei 

2 cos


2

1 + ei 

2 sin


2

2,

(2.20)

where we could also choose  instead of + between the two terms. this expression will
be useful later in the paper.

finally, its worth noting a general form of the matrix m for more than 2 spinors. in

the case of 2n spinors, m is a 2n  2n matrix which takes a block form

m =   a b
b a!

where a and b are n  n complex matrices which satisfy the following equations:

ab = ba
a2 + bb = i.

(2.21)

(2.22)

it is easy to see that for n = 1, above equations yield precisely the matrix m given in
equation (2.16).

3 the on-shell usp(2) supersymmetric u(1) yang-

mills theory on ads5

let us start with the massless usp(2) supersymmetric yang-mills theory in at 4+1
spacetime. su(2) version of this theory has been developed by zizzi [10]. u(1) theory is
easily obtained from su(2) theory:

l = 

1
4

f f +

1
2

dd +

i
2

id/ i

(3.1)

4

and invariant under the following supersymmetry transformations:

a = iii
 = iii
i = (f   d/ )i

(3.2)

where ,  = 0, . . . , 4 and i = 1, 2. to describe the same theory on ads5 not only do we
need to have additional terms in the supersymmetry transformations but we will have
nonzero mass terms for both the scalar  and the spinors i for the case of massless
gauge potential. in fact, compactication of n = 2 supergravity on s5 [11] or ads/cft
correspondence [3, 12] let us determine these masses:

m2(a) = 0,

| m() |=

1
2

, m2() = 4.

(3.3)

hence, the u(1) yang-mills theory on ads5 should be the at u(1) theory (3.1) plus the
above mass terms:

l = 

1
4

f f +

1
2

dd +

i
2

id/ i  aijij 

1
2

a2m22.

(3.4)

using the proper killing spinor equation (2.12) for the symplectic majorana spinors, we
nd that theory (3.4) is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations

a = iii
 = iii
i = (f   d/ )i  2iamijj

(3.5)

where mij is the matrix given by eq. (2.16). furthermore, supersymmetry determines
the values of the masses in eq. (3.4):

 = 

1
4

m, m2 = 4.

(3.6)

it is easy to show that given a denition of a properly normalized dirac spinor as in

eq. (2.20),

and

i
2

1
2

id/ i = id/ 

mijij = .

(3.7)

(3.8)

hence, this theory contains a dirac spinor of mass equal to 1
2 and one real scalar of
mass equal to 4. these masses agree completely with our previous predictions given in
equation (3.3).

5

to complete the description of this theory we need to write down the supersymmetry

algebra. using eq. (3.5), we nd that

[1, 2] = 2ii

12id

(3.9)

and similarly a usual expression for [1, 2]a (up to equations of motion and gauge
transformations) because just like in the scalar case above all the terms proportional to
a cancel. however, supersymmetry algebra for the spinors is more interesting:

[1, 2]i = 2idij

12j + 3amijjk

12k +

a
2

imkjk

12j,

(3.10)

where we used spinor equations of motion

d/ i =

i
2

amijj

and the following useful identities

mnlij  milnj + mijnl  mnjil = 0
nj(m)ik + knmij = minjk
njik + knij = injk.

(3.11)

(3.12)

to explain the terms appearing in this algebra, rst consider only the fermionic part of
the lagrangian

lf =

i
2

id/ i +

amijij.

(3.13)

1
4

from the properties of the matrix m (eqs. (2.13) and (2.15)), it follows that there is an
additional u(1) symmetry in the theory:

i = imijj.

(3.14)

this extra symmetry manifests itself in the supersymmetry algebra, as we see from
the second term in eq. (3.10). furthermore, supersymmetry algebra involves a term
proportional to

imkjk

12j

(3.15)

which at rst glance appears unusual. however, there is a clear and dimension inde-
pendent explanation of this term. the proof of the following arguments is presented in
appendix b. below, we chose to work in 4 dimensions because we do not wish to involve
the symplectic indices. in 5 dimensions, the following discussion is slightly more involved
but follows the same outline as the proof in appendix b. to facilitate the explanation, let
us look at the ads4 supersymmetric theory [7]. if we compute supersymmetry algebra of
the fermions using transformations (3.1) of that paper, we obtain (with our conventions)

[1, 2]l = idl12 +

a
4

l12.

(3.16)

6

this algebra contains an extra term of the same form as eq. (3.15). the explanation
of this extra term in the algebra lies in the fact that the naive isometry transformation

 = k d,

(3.17)

where k  = i12 is an o(3,2) killing vector, is actually not a symmetry of the kinetic
term in curved space. on a curved manifold, we need to add more terms to this variation
because dk no longer equals to 0. in particular, in ads we need to add precisely the
extra term in eq. (3.16) in order to recover a symmetry of the lagrangian. using the
fact that

dk = a12

(3.18)

we expect that in ads4 the full o(3,2) isometry requires the following transformation
rule:

 = id12 + a12 = k d +

dk 

(3.19)

1
4

which can be veried to be a symmetry of the lagrangian (see appendix b). hence, we
indeed expect a term like (3.15) in the supersymmetry algebra of our theory on ads5.

let us nally note that extending the above results to an su(n) gauge theory is quite
trivial. assuming that all the matter elds are in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group su(n), the lagrangian is

l = 

1

i
2

iad/ a

i +

1
4

amijiaa

j + 2a2aa 

i

gfabciabc
i

(3.20)

where a, b, c = 1, 2, . . . , n 2  1 and the covariant derivatives are now dened as

2a

i + gfabcab

c
i

i + 1

i = a

da
da = a + gfabcab
f a

 = aa

  aa

c

 + gfabcab

ac
.

(3.21)

with these denitions, the theory (3.20) is invariant under exactly the same transforma-
tions as before, keeping in mind the denitions above:

 = iia
i

aa
a = iia
i
a

i = ( f a  d/ a)i  2iaamijj.

(3.22)

therefore, all the results, including the eld masses and the supersymmetry algebra,
remain exactly the same in the case of su(n) gauge theory.

7

4 the on-shell usp(2) supersymmetric conformal scalar

theory on ads5

this theory describes 2 massless symplectic majorana fermions and 4 massive real scalar
elds with the same mass for all 4 scalars. a generalization of this theory has been
developed in at 5-dimensional spacetime [13]. as in the previous section, we use the
at theory to develop this same theory on ads5:

l =

1
2

ii +

i



i
2

d/ i 

1
2

a2m2ii

(4.1)

where  = 0, . . . , 4, i = 1, . . . , 4, and i = 1, 2. the theory (4.1) is invariant under the
supersymmetry

i = (i)ijij
i = i(i)ji/ ij + a 3

2(i t m)ijji

(4.2)

where i = (~, i1), m is the matrix found in eq. (2.16),  is the symplectic metric in
the matrix form, and i is a symplectic majorana killing spinor. supersymmetry also
determines the value of m in this theory:

m2 = 

15
4

.

(4.3)

note that this formula agrees with the mass formula for the conformally coupled scalar
eld in 5 dimensions [7, 14].

now, we are ready to compute the supersymmetry algebra for this theory. after a

short computation, we obtain

[1, 2]i = 2ii

12ii + a

3
2

i

2(cid:16)ij 

m  mj i (cid:17)ij

1jj.

(4.4)

it appears (and can be conrmed by an explicit computation) that there exists an extra
symmetry in this theory

i = i

2(ij 

m  mj i 

)ij1jj .

(4.5)

in fact, this transformation represents rotation of the scalar elds i = ii
where t is a 4  4 matrix

21it ijj

t =

(4.6)

and ~x is dened in eq. (2.16). hence, for each xed matrix m, this is a particular repre-
sentation of the so(2) subgroup of the obvious so(4) symmetry of the scalar lagrangian.

the spinor algebra, on the other hand, presents nothing new, although the previous
extra term associated with the o(4,2) isometry does. in order to calculate this algebra,
we need to know a few useful identities given below:

 = 4jmin
 = 0
jn = 0
jn = 4inmmj
 = 0
 = 4mmjin

mii
(i)ji(i)mn  i
jn
(i)ji(i)mn + i
mii
jn
mi(mi )
(i)ji(mi)mn + i
mi(mi )
(i)ji(mi)mn  i
(mi )ji(i)mn  (mi )mii
jn
(mi )ji(i)mn + (mi )mii
jn
(mi )ij(i)mn + (mi t )imi
(mi )ij(i)mn  (mi t )imi

 = 0
 = 4jmmin.

jn

jn

(4.7)

then, using these identities we arrive at the following result

[1, 2]i = 2idij

12j +

a
2

imkjk

12j

(4.8)

which is remarkably similar to the supersymmetric algebra for the spinors in ads4 as
given by eq. (3.16).

5 the on-shell usp(2) supersymmetric massive scalar

theory on ads5

similarly to the conformal scalar theory presented in the previous section, this theory
describes 2 massive symplectic majorana fermions and 4 massive real scalar elds. the
theory is described by an action similar to that of conformal scalar theory given by
eq. (4.1):

ii +

l =

amij

d/ i 

j 
the new feature here is a symmetric real 4  4 matrix m2
ij which is not assumed to be
diagonal apriori. also, note that we have already introduced the correct form of the
spinor mass term according to the prescription in eq. (3.8) so that this theory contains a
dirac spinor of mass . the theory (5.1) can be shown to be invariant under the following
supersymmetry transformation rules:

provided that the scalar mass matrix, m2

calculations below.

ij , takes a very specic form, which will be deter-
ij is nontrivial, so we provide the necessary

9

using the supersymmetry transformation rules (5.2) to vary the action, we nd that
all the terms proportional to 1 and a cancel but terms proportional to a2 yield the
following matrix equation for each i:

15

(cid:18)2 

4 (cid:19) i + mi m = m2

ij j .

(5.3)

one way to solve this equation is to expand everything in {i} basis and then set the
coecients of each i matrix to 0. noting that m4m = 4, for i = 1, 2, 3 we write

mi m = cijj

where c is a 3  3 matrix easily found from eq. (2.16):
2x2
1  1 2x1x2 2x1x3
2x1x2 2x2
2  1 2x2x3
2x1x3 2x2x3 2x2

with




we note that for i = 2 eq. (5.3) decouples from the rest of the equations giving us

~x = (sin  cos , sin  sin , cos ).

where we used eq. (5.4) above. a few simple manipulations yield the values of the

33 = 2  15
m2
44 = 2  15
m2

4 + c33
4 + c11
4 + c22.

(5.8)

plugging these values back into eq. (5.7) we nd all the other elements of the scalar mass
matrix:

finally, putting eqs. (5.8) and (5.9) together we nd the scalar mass matrix

m2
13 = c13, m2

14 = c23, m2

34 = c12.

where the rows and columns can be rearranged to give a block diagonal form. to nd
the physical values of the masses we need to diagonalize m2 and read the physical masses
o of the diagonal. this procedure yields

m2 = 2 +

(5.11)

this answer is remarkable because these are precisely the masses we expect from the
ads/cft correspondence [3, 12]: from the ads/cft correspondence we know that this
theory should contain a complex scalar with conformal dimension , a complex spinor
with conformal dimension  + 1
2, and another complex scalar with conformal dimension
 + 1, which in 5 dimensions gives the spinor mass

and the two scalar masses

 =  +

1
2  2 =  

3
2

m2 = (  4)
m2 = ( + 1)(  3)

which in turn implies that the complex scalars in this theory should have their masses
equal to

m2 = (cid:16) + 3
m2 = (cid:16) + 5

2(cid:17)(cid:16)  5
2(cid:17)(cid:16)  3

2(cid:17) = 2    15
2(cid:17) = 2 +   15

4

4 .

hence, eq. (5.10) is the correct scalar mass matrix as the equations (5.11) and (5.14) are
in exact agreement.

to complete the study of this theory we calculate the supersymmetry algebra for the

spinors and scalars under the transformation rules (5.2). for the scalars, we obtain

which is almost the same as the supersymmetry algebra for the conformal scalar theory,
eq. (4.4), with addition of a term proportional to the spinor mass, . because the scalar
mass term (5.10) breaks so(4) symmetry down to so(2)so(2) (this fact becomes
obvious once the scalar elds are rotated so that the scalar mass term becomes diagonal
 see discussion below), the two non-derivative terms in the algebra must encode at least
some part of this symmetry of the lagrangian. to see this more clearly, let us assume
that 1, 2 and 3, 4 have physical masses 2 +   15
4 respectively,
so that each pair transforms under separate symmetries. first, note that even with this
symmetry breaking, the transformation

4 and 2    15

(5.16)

11

is by itself a symmetry of the kinetic part of the scalar lagrangian because before the
transformation (4.5) was a symmetry of the kinetic part as well. to establish this fact is
nontrivial, but it all boils down to showing that

for all values of i, j. we can again rewrite the above transformation in a more compact

now, we only need to understand how the transformation (5.15) acts on the mass term.
to see this more clearly, let us redene

with the matrix o dened as follows:

i = oijj

o =

x3 0q1  x2
0 1
x1x31x2
x1 0
x2 0  x2x31x2

(5.20)

x21x2
x11x2

with this eld redenition, the scalar mass matrix becomes diagonal in precisely the way
discussed above and the transformation (5.15) becomes

i = ii

21ii + iai

21ih3(ot t o)ij + 2(ot qo)iji j

(5.21)

where t and q are dened in eqs. (4.6) and (5.18) respectively. using eq. (5.20) we can
explicitely compute

ot t o =

0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0
0 0 01
0 0 1 0







, ot qo =




01 0 0
1 0 0 0
0 0 01
0 0 1 0

.




(5.22)

hence the transformation (5.21) of the new elds encodes a particular so(2) symmetry
of the larger so(2)so(2) symmetry of the scalar lagrangian.

12

the spinor supersymmetry algebra is quite similar to that of the previously derived

conformal scalar theory, eq. (4.8):

[1, 2]i = 2idij

12j  2amikkj

12j +

a
2

imkjk

12j

(5.23)

with a new term proportional to the spinor mass . as before, the third term with
 in this algebra is exactly the extra symmetry term required to recover the o(4,2)
symmetry of the lagrangian, and the new term proportional to  is reminiscent of the
u(1) symmetry (3.14) in the yang-mills theory described in section 3.

appendix

a summary of results in (, +, , +) signature

in this section we will summarize some of the formulas given in body of the text for the
(, +,   , +) signature. we do so because most of the recent literature on ads uses this
signature almost exclusively. note that in this signature, the curvature takes the usual
form, r = (d  1)a2g.

most of the formulas can be converted to the (, +,   , +) signature simply by chang-
ing   i for every  in the formula. hence, a complex unconstrained killing spinor
equation (2.11) becomes:

its solution (2.17) becomes:

d =

a
2

,

 = e

1

2 arr (cid:18)1 +

ax(1  r)(cid:19) 0,

symplectic majorana killing spinor equation (2.12) becomes:

di = mij

a

j,

(a.1)

(a.2)

(a.3)

and its solution (2.18) becomes:

i = (cid:16)e

2 arm r(cid:17)ij(cid:18)jk +

2

ax(mjk  jkr)(cid:19) k.

(a.4)

other formulas, such as supersymmetry transformation rules, have to be checked carefully
when changing signatures so that the properties of the elds, e.g. real or symplectic
majorana, are satised by the transformations. when this is done carefully, we nd that
the yang-mills theory transformation rules (3.5) become:

a = iii
 = ii
i = ( f  + id/ )i + 2iamijj,
the conformal scalar theory transformation rules (4.2) become:

i = i(i)ijij
i = (i)ji/ ij  a 3

2(i t m)ijji,

and the massive scalar theory transformation rules (5.2) become:

i = i(i)ijij
i = (i)ji/ ij  a 3

2(i t m)ijji + ia(mi )ijji.

b isometry transformations for spinors on ads

(a.5)

(a.6)

(a.7)

in this section we will attempt to prove that the action of a free, massless spinor on adsd
is invariant under

(b.1)
where k  is an o(d  1, 2) killing vector. this proof remains true in any spacetime
dimension and for any spinor whose action is given by the usual lagrangian

 = k d +

1
4

dk 

l = id/ .

(b.2)

although o(d  1, 2) killing vectors and their properties on adsd can be studied
independently of the killing spinors, we will use the denition of killing vectors through
killing spinors (true only in some dimensions) as a shortcut to establish the following
property of the killing vectors:

ddk = dd (i12) = ad (12) = a2 (gk  gk)

(b.3)

where in the intermediate steps we used the killing spinor equation (2.11) and the prop-
erties of the cliord algebra

{, } = 2g.

14

(b.4)

note that although the intermediate steps in eq. (b.3) involve killing spinors, the nal
result is expressed only in terms of the killing vectors. hence, this is a general property
of the o(d  1, 2) killing vectors. similarly, we can establish another killing vector
property:

now, let us vary the free action by

dk = dk.

1 = k d

which yields:

1(cid:16)d/ (cid:17) = k dd/  + k d/ d + ddk 

= [d, d]k  + ddk 
= a2 d1

2 k  + ddk ,

(b.5)

(b.6)

(b.7)

where to go from line 2 to line 3 we used the ricci identity, eq. (2.14). thus, it is clear
that the above transformation is not a symmetry of the lagrangian. now, let us vary
the action by

which gives

2 = dk 

2(cid:16)d/ (cid:17) = dkd/  + dkd/  + ddk

= 2dk(g  g)d  2a2(d  1)k 
= 4ddk   2a2(d  1)k 

(b.8)

(b.9)

where to go from line 1 to line 2 we used the properties of the cliord algebra and of the
killing vectors, eq. (b.3). therefore, it is now clear that the action of a free, massless
spinor on ads is invariant under

(1 + 2) = k d +

1
4

dk .

(b.10)

let us nally note that for d = 5, the preceding proof can be applied verbatim to the
case of the symplectic majorana spinors if we note that on ads5

12i

k  = ii
dk = amiji
12j = dk
ddk = a2(gk  gk).

(b.11)

c results in d 6= 5

in this section, we give some results for dimensions other than 5. these results hold
for those dimensions where symplectic majorana spinors can be dened and the charge
conjugation matrix can be chosen to satisfy eq. (2.10). we know [4] that both conditions
can be satised in d = 5, 6 mod 8. also, it is conceivable that similar approach has to be
taken for d = 8, 9 mod 8 as the only way to dene majorana spinors there is to take a
symmetric charge conjugation matrix that satises eq. (2.10). however, it is important
to realize that the transformation rules given below do not describe supersymmetry in
dimensions above 5, but instead describe some accidental symmetry of the free non-
interacting lagrangian. we give the transformation rules and particle masses consistent
with these transformations for the theories discussed in the paper. note that the spinor
algebra following from these transformations will change because fierz identities take
dierent from in dierent dimensions.
