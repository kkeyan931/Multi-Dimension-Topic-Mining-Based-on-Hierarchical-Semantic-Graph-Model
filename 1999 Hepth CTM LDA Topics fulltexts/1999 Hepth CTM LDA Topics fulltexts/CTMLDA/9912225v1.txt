abstract

we study bps dominated loop amplitudes in m-theory on t 2. for this
purpose we generalize the concept of helicity supertraces to nine spacetime
dimensions. these traces distinguish between various massive supermulti-
plets and appear as coecients in their one-loop contributions to n-graviton
scattering amplitudes. this can be used to show that only ultrashort bps
multiplets contribute to the r4 term in the eective action, which was rst
computed by green, gutperle and vanhove. there are two inequivalent ultra-
short bps multiplets which describe the kaluza-klein states and the wrapped
membranes that cover the torus a number of times. from the perspective of
the type-ii strings they correspond to momentum and winding states and d0
or d1 branes.

m-theory is believed to provide a unifying framework of all known superstring
theories. its low-energy limit is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity [1].
the latter theory exhibits nonrenormalizable ultraviolet behavior which will presum-
ably be cured once one includes the additional m-theory degrees of freedom. upon
compactication to lower dimensions, all the duality symmetries of string theory,
such as s-, t- and u-duality, should become manifest. however the fundamental,
microscopic formulation of m-theory is so far unknown. matrix theory [2, 3] is one
attempt in this direction. closely related to this is the idea that supermembranes [4]
constitute the fundamental degrees of freedom of m-theory. supermembrane theory
may not suer from the incompleteness of perturbative string theory. unlike string
theory, which has both a string tension as well as a coupling constant, it has no
conventional perturbative expansion as its only parameter is the membrane tension
tm.

in this paper we consider bps-dominated amplitudesc in m-theory compact-
ied on a two-dimensional torus t 2, or equivalently type-iia/b superstring the-
ory compactied on s1. bps states play an important role in the computation of
loop amplitudes in theories with extended supersymmetry. the masses of the bps
states are often supposed to be exact functions of the moduli so that amplitudes
that receive their contributions exclusively from bps states are also exact, even
beyond perturbation theory. here we will focus on the one-loop four-graviton scat-
tering amplitude which provides the coecient of the gravitational r4 term in the
corresponding low-energy eective action. computing this one-loop amplitude in
eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied on t 2 to nine spacetime dimensions
[5, 17, 18, 19, 20], the nonvanishing contribution is associated with the sum over the
tower of doubly-charged kalazu-klein states which circulate in the nine-dimensional
loop.

from a nine-dimensional perspective one can study the one-loop contributions
to the r4 term coming from a variety of supermultiplets. in order to analyze what
kind of massive states can contribute to the loop amplitude, we adopt the concept of
helicity supertraces [13, 14, 15] but now extended to nine dimensions. we will then
show that the r4 terms are exclusively generated by the ultrashort bps multiplets.
as was recently dicussed [16] there are two inequivalent ultrashort multiplets, one
corresponding to the kaluza-klein states from eleven-dimensional supergravity and
the other one corresponding to the kaluza-klein states from iib supergravity. the
latter states can be interpreted as the wrapped membrane states of m-theory. sum-
ming over both types of states thus yields the exact answer for m-theory, as other
massive supermultiplets cannot contribute. we then show that including the sum

cbps amplitudes in perturbative and nonperturbative string theory have been discussed in

many places  see e.g. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

over the wrapped membrane states (using the same subtraction method as used in
[5] for the kaluza-klein states on t 2) yields the correct amplitude consistent with
t-duality. the r6 terms receive contributions from intermediate bps multiplets
but not from long (non-bps) multiplets, while r8 and higher-order terms receive
contributions from all supermultiplets

let us now rst generalize the concept of helicity (super)traces for massive states
to nine spacetime dimensions where the group of rest-frame rotations is given by
so(8). following [14] we dene a generating function for the helicity traces by

zr(y) = trr(cid:16)gso(8)(cid:17) = trr(cid:16) exp[i ~  ~h](cid:17) ,

(1)

where the trace and the so(8) group element gso(8) are dened in a representation
r. obviously the generating function depends only on the group conjugacy classes
parametrized by four angles i associated with the torus of the cartan subalgebra.
the hi denote the generators of the cartan subalgebra in the representation r and
the variables yi are dened by yi = exp[i i/2]. the generating functions satises
the following properties,

zrr(y) = zr(y) + zr(y) ,
zrr(y) = zr(y) zr(y) ,

zr(y) = zr(y1) ,

zr(y = 1) = dim(r) ,

(2)

which are easy to prove. all the above results can readily be generalized to a
supertrace for which we will not introduce any new notation. note, however, that
the supertrace for yi = 1 is equal to the graded trace of the identity and will thus
vanish for supermultiplets.

the helicity traces are now n-th rank symmetric tensors dened by (no summa-

tion over repeated indices)

.

observe that the trace will vanish for odd values of n.
spacetime dimensions, these results coincide with those of [14].

note that the three representations 350, 350 and 350 appear in the square of the
8v, 8s and 8c representations, respectively. these results may for instance be ob-
tained by making use of the weight vectors for these representations, which we have
collected in the appendix.

let us now review the various possible bps multiplets associated with the nine-
dimensional n = 2 supersymmetry algebra with lorentz invariant central charges
[16]. there are three independent charges. two of them rotate under the action of
the the so(2) automorphism group, while the other one is invariant. due to this
particular structure of the central charges there exist three types of bps multiplets
(as always we can combine multiplets into larger multiplets with higher spins by
assigning spin to the cliord vacuum, but this does not aect their characterization
as bps states).

first there exist two inequivalent types of ultrashort multiplets of massive 1/2
bps states, which are annihilated by inequivalent subsets of 16 supercharges. both
multiplets contain 28 = 128 + 128 states. when the so(2) invariant central charge
vanishes and the other one has a magnitude equal to the rest mass of the multiplet,
the multiplet decomposes as

(8v + 8s)  (8v + 8c) = [10 + 8v + 280 + 350 + 56v]boson

3

+ [8s + 8c + 56s + 56c]fermion.

(5)

this is the multiplet that comprises the kaluza-klein states of iia supergravity
compactied on s1, which are the momentum states of the compactied iia string.
therefore this particular multiplet is known as the kka multiplet. also the d0-
branes of the iia superstring transform according to this multiplet. the second
ultrashort multiplet is the kkb multiplet. now only the noninvariant central charge
is dierent from zero and equal in magnitude to the rest mass. the multiplet
decomposes according to

(8v + 8c)  (8v + 8c) = [10 + 10 + 280 + 280 + 350 + 350]boson

+ [8s + 8s + 56s + 56s]fermion.

(6)

this supermultiplet comprises the kaluza-klein states of iib supergravity compact-
ied on s1. clearly, the bps states associated with a membrane wrapped around
t 2 in eleven dimensions will also constitute kkb multiplets.

intermediate multiplets exist of massive 1/4 bps states annihilated by 8 super-
charges. this multiplet carries both types of central charges. the smallest multiplet
contains 212 = 211 + 211 states. they do appear in string theory as mixed states
that carry both winding and momentum and have a nonzero oscillator number in
order to satisfy the mass-shell condition. hence they carry masses of the order of
the string scale. the smallest multiplet associated with the lowest spins decomposes
as

(8v + 8s)  (8v + 8c)  (8v + 8c)

(7)

(or its conjugate).

finally there are the long (non-bps) multiplets where all the supercharges act

nontrivially. the smallest one comprises 216 states and decomposes into

(8v + 8s)  (8v + 8s)  (8v + 8c)  (8v + 8c).

(8)

before proceeding to the determination of the generating functions for the four
classes of supermultiplets, let us dene these functions for two n = 1 supermultiplets
consisting of (8v + 8s) and (8v + 8c). observe that these are precisely the bps
multiplets that one obtains from compactifying the ten-dimensional supersymmetric
gauge theory on s1. we denote the corresponding generating functions by z[s] and
z[c]. they are given byd

z[s](y) = z8v(y)  z8s(y) ,
z[c](y) = z8v(y)  z8c(y) ,

(9)
dbps supermultiplets are necessarily complex in order to transform under the central charge.
this requires to add an additional factor equal to two in the denition of the generating functions
and the helicity traces. we suppress this factor throughout because we eventually sum over the
(positive and negative) charges

4

and can be calculated from the expressions given in (4). it then follows straightfor-
wardly that the helicity traces generated by z[s] and z[c] vanish for n < 4.

from the above result it follows that

zkka(y) = zr(y) z[s](y) z[c](y) ,
zkkb(y) = zr(y) z 2

[c](y) ,

zinterm(y) = zr(y) z[s](y) z 2
[s](y) z 2

zlong(y) = zr(y) z 2

[c](y) ,
[c](y) ,

(10)

where r denotes the spin representation of the cliord vacuum. this suces to
show that the helicity supertraces bn are vanishing for kka and kkb multiplets
whenever n < 8, for intermediate multiplets whenever n < 12 and for long multiplets
whenever n < 16. this result has important implications for the one-loop graviton
amplitudes in type-ii string theories, as we will show below (obviously there is
a corresponding result for n = 1 theories pertaining to the one-loop gauge eld
amplitudes).

subsequently we review the spectrum of the bps states of m-theory compactied
to nine spacetime dimensions on t 2 [23, 24, 16]. the bps mass formula based on
the supersymmetry algebra with a membrane winding charge, takes the form

mq1,q2,p =

1

a 2 |q1   q2| + tm a|p| .

(11)

the ultrashort bps multiplets are either given by kalazu-klein states with momen-
tum numbers (q1, q2) along the two periods of t 2 or by wrapped membranes which
cover the torus p times. the kaluza-klein charges (q1, q2) transform as doublets
under the so(2) automorphism group of the supersymmetry algebra; the charge
associated with the wrapped membrane states is invariant under this group. in (11)
a denotes the volume of t 2, measured with respect to the 11-dimensional metric,
 = 1 + i2 denotes the complex structure of t 2 and tm denotes the membrane
tension.

the bps mass formula (11) can be interpreted in the context of type-ii super-
strings compactied on s1. for this purpose let us recall the well-known relations be-
tween the string and m-theory parameters [25, 26]. for simplicity we set tm = 1 and
assume that the m-theory metric is diagonal and has the form gij = diag (r2
10),
so that a = r9r10, 1 = 0 and 2 = r9/r10. the ten-dimensional iia string coupling
and the nine-dimensional radius of type-iia on s1 (in the string frame) are related
to the m-theory parameters by

9 = r9 r10 .

(12)

using t-duality between iia and iib in nine dimensions we can express the corre-
sponding iib parameters in the following way (everything measured with respect to

subsequently we can express the bps mass formula (11) in the string frame in terms
of iia and iib string theory variables, respectively,

therefore from the perspective of the iia string theory, q1 is the iia kaluza-klein
momentum number, while q2 is the d0-brane charge. the m-theory membrane
wrapping number p becomes the perturbative winding number in the iia string.
on the other hand, from the iib perspective, q1 and q2 are the winding numbers
of the elemenary string and of the solitonic d1 string, and the membrane wrapping
number p is the iib kaluza-klein momentum. the iib strong-weak coupling s-
duality interchanges the elementary strings with the d1 strings: q1  q2. under
the iia/b duality, q1  p, the iia/iib mass formulas are interchanged provided
one interchanges the d0 with the d1 states. clearly the presence of the wrapped
membranes is essential, as they correspond either to the iia winding states or to
the iib momentum states, respectively.

in (perturbative) type-ii string theory the various bps states emerge as follows.
ultrashort bps states, which preserve 16 of the total 32 supersymmetries, must be
1/2 bps states both with respect to the left-moving n = 1 and also with respect
to the right-moving n = 1 supersymmetry algebra. therefore these states are
not allowed to carry any oscillator excitations, i.e. nl = nr = 0. hence their
so(8) helicities are entirely determined by the bosonic and fermionic groundstates,
(8v + 8s(c))l  (8v + 8c)r, leading to the decomposition in (5) and (6) for the two
ultrashort multiplets. using the string level matching condition, p2
r, where
pl,r = q1/ra
9 for iia, and similarly for iib, it follows that the ultrashort bps
states can carry either nonvanishing kka quantum numbers qi or non-vanishing
kkb quantum numbers p, but not both.

9 pra

l = p2

the intermediate, 1/4 bps states are short 1/2 bps multiplets with respect to
the left-moving n = 1 supersymmetry algebra but are long multiplets with respect
to the right-moving n = 1 supersymmetry algebra (or vice versa). therefore they
require nl = 0 and nr arbitrary. the level matching condition p2
r + 2nr now
tells us that intermediate multiplets must have both winding and momentum and
tus carry both type of charges. for nr = 1 we have precisely the decomposition (7),
while for higher nr we have intermediate bps multiplets of higher spin. finally the
long multiplets have nl, nr 6= 0. the smallest long multiplet with nl = nr = 1
has precisely the decomposition (8) and others will have higher spins.

l = p2

after this perusal of the various supermultiplets from complementary viewpoints,
we briey discuss the helicity generating partition function of m-theory on t 2. for
string theory it has been argued [15] that this partition function is related to the
string amplitudes for multi-graviton scattering which we will turn to shortly. hence
we start from the corresponding expression for the perturbative type-ii string in
nine dimensions,

z(, ; q, q) = strhql0 q l0eiihi+i i hii .

here q and q are related to the world-sheet modular parameter in the usual way.
the expression for z(, ; q, q) can be written as

note that in z(, ; q, q) we have neglected the contributions from the bosonic oscil-
lators (so that we will not discuss the issue of the modular transformation properties
of z). the products of -functions originate from the sum over spin structures and
encode the helicities associated with the fermionic zero modes; in particular we draw
attention to the presence of the sign factor sgn(pl pr) = sgn(q2
9 )2) in
front of the 1( i, q) functions, which is required in order to correctly account for the
dierent helicities of the momentum and winding states [16]. obviously the lattice
summation in (17) acts on this sign factor as well. owing to the sign factor, which
is +1 for iia momentum states and iib winding states, respectively, and 1 for iia
winding states and iib momentum states, respectively, the partition function (17)
tends to the correct expression for iia string theory in the decompactication limit
ra
9   and for iib string theory in the limit ra
an intriguing question is whether one can extend the sum over the perturbative
momentum and winding string states, by including the nonperturbative bps states
of m-theory with masses as given in (11). by using the so(2) symmetry among
the kaluza-klein states with momentum numbers q1 and q2, we are led to postulate
that the same split into left- and right-moving masses l0 and l0 as in string theory
will also hold for compactied m-theory, i.e., we replace pl and pr in the above
expression by

9  0.

(18)

pl,r2

then the m-theory bps sum takes the following form:

1,1(q, q) = xq1,q2,p

q| q1 q2a2

+atm p|2

q| q1 q2a2 atm p|2

.

(19)

however, 1,1 does not depend on the angles and therefore plays only a minor
role on what follows. clearly, apart from 1,1, the expression (17) factorizes in a
holomorphic and an anti-holomorphic part. the appearance of the sum over the
i=1 a(i), is of crucial importance for what follows.
using the riemann identity the -functions, we can rewrite (17) in the following
way:

powers of theta-functions, q4

z(, ; q, q) =

1

|(q)|8 1,1(q, q)

yi=1

1(i/2, q) 1( i/2, q) ,

(20)

where

(21)

1 = sgn(pl pr) 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ,
2 = sgn(pl pr) 1 + 2  3  4 ,
3 = sgn(pl pr) 1  2 + 3  4 ,
4 = sgn(pl pr) 1  2  3 + 4 .

1 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ,
2 = 1 + 2  3  4 ,
3 = 1  2 + 3  4 ,
4 = 1  2  3 + 4 ,
the holomorphic part of the helicity generating partition function is the direct
string generalization of the eld theory generating function z8v(y)z8c(y), discussed
before, where in the string case we deal not only with the graded sum over the vector
8v and the spinor 8c ground states, but also with the graded sum over the whole
weight lattice related to these two so(8) representations. this sum vanishes for
i = 0 due to space-time supersymmetry. the corresponding helicity supertraces
are given by the multiple derivatives of the partition function, after setting i = i,
i.e.,

z(i, i; q, q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)i=0

.

(22)

b2n(q) = (1)n 

i1   



i2n

because 1(0, q) = 0 and 1(, q)/|=0 = 2(q)3, we need at least four powers
of /i and four powers of / i in order to get a nonvanishing result, in agreement
with the previous discussion. for example, b8 can only get contributions from
ultrashort kka or kkb multiplets, while b12 receives contributions from both
ultrashort and intermediate supermultiplets.

now we turn to the evaluation of the n-graviton amplitudes, i.e. we consider
one-loop string amplitudes with n insertions of graviton vertex operators. in the
zero-ghost picture, the graviton vertex operator has the form,

gmn  (cid:16)xm + ipm

4

xi=1

ii(cid:17)(cid:16)  xn + ipn

4

xi=1

i i(cid:17) ei px ,

(23)

8

hence the graviton amplitude can be expanded in terms of powers of the opera-
tors ii and i i which are the cartan subalgebra currents of so(8) in the
left- and right-moving sector generated by the world-sheet fermions. their charges
hi = (2i)1h ii and hi = (2i)1h i i are the cartan algebra generators of

so(8). furthermore the amplitude factorizes into contributions from the left- and
the right-moving sector. each contribution thus decomposes into a linear combi-
nation of the helicity supertraces that are generated by the functions (9). because
the number of gravitons is equal to the highest power of of helicity operators hi
and hi, the n-graviton amplitude is proportional to b2n and lower helicity super-
traces. this proves that the four-graviton amplitude must be proportional to the
helicity supertrace b8 and will thus receive constributions from only ultrashort bps
multiplets. likewise the six-graviton amplitude will receive contributions from both
ultrashort and intermediate bps multiplets. the contribution from the latter con-
tains a term proportional to b12. for eight and more gravitons all supermultiplets
will in principle contribute.

having established these results, we briey consider the r4 terms in more detail.
here we cast the calculation in terms of nine-dimensional eld theory, where the
relevant amplitude has the structure of a box diagram in massive 3 theory in nine
spacetime dimensions. in view of our previous results it suces to restrict ourselves
to contributions from the kka and kkb states. since we evaluate the coecient
of the r4 term at zero momentum, such an integral takes the form

(24)

observe that this integral has a linear ultraviolet divergence, which reects itself in
the singular behaviour of the integrand at t = 0. the integral has the dimension
of a mass, which is appropriate for a coupling constant of r4 in nine spacetime
dimensions. we will now use (24) and the bps mass formula (11) and determine
the contributions from both the kka and the kkb states. for the former we obtain

in the second line of (25) we performed a poisson resummation and changed the
integration variable t  a/t. observe that the ultraviolet divergence is now
associated with the upper integration boundary and is only present for the term
with q1 = q2 = 0. this contribution was dropped in the third line.

likewise, we obtain for the kkb states,

again we performed a poisson resummation and changed the integration variable
t  /t (tma)2; and we dropped the ultraviolet divergence associated with p = 0
in the third line. the sum over p in the third line is equal to 2(2) = 2/3. we
return to the issue of ultraviolent divergences shortly.

combining the results (25) and (27) gives rise to

this result is invariant under the iib s-duality symmetry   (a + b)/(c + d).
the contribution from the kkb states is such that the result is compatible with
t-duality of type-ii string theory.

let us consider the two possible decompactication limits to the ten-dimensional
iia/b theories. here we need the result that, for 1 = 0 and 2 large, the function
f (,  ) has the form

f (,  ) = 2 (3)  3/2

the one-loop contributions to the r4 term, and the ellipses denote exponentially

contributions. (the factor r10 is related to the fact that we expressed the kka
and kkb masses in the m-theory frame; in the string frame this factor disappears.)

it is an intriguing question why the subtraction method based on poisson re-
summation and the subsequent subtraction of the q1 = q2 = 0 and p = 0 terms
leads to the correct result. a puzzling feature of the calculation is that the sum
over the kka and the sum over the kkb states both include the massless states,
which seems to make no sense. correcting for this requires to subtract an innite
term which could in principle be cancelled against the positive innite contributions
of the massive bps states. however, why the cut-o should be ne-tuned such
that this cancellation takes place remains a mystery. within the context of nine-
dimensional supersymmetry there are no other states that could possibly cancel the
innite terms. the coecient of the r4 term is not generically nite, which reects
itself in the fact that the kka contributions disappear in the decompactication
limit to eleven dimensions, a  , which is somewhat counterintuitive. we stress
that supersymmetry does not seem to be relevant for obtaining nite results, in view
of the fact that the supertraces for the kka and kkb multiplets do not vanish,
and no cancellation seems to arise between the ininite contributions from the two
types of multiplets.

appendix

for the convenience of the reader we present the weight vectors for a number of so(8)
representations which can be used in the construction of the generating functions
(4). to each of the weight vectors one must add all possible permutations.
in
certain cases the number of minus signs must be even or odd. this is indicated by,
e.g. [+20; even], implying that 20 independent permutations should be added with
an even number of minus signs. the subscripts 0, v, s and c refer to the dierent
