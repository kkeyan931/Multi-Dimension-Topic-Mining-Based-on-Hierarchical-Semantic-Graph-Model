abstract: we briey review the computation of graviton and antisymmetric tensor
scattering amplitudes in matrix theory from a diagramatic s-matrix point of view.

it is by now commonly believed that eleven dimensional supergravity is the low-energy
eective theory of a more fundamental microscopic model, known as m-theory. a pro-
posed denition of m-theory has been given in terms of the large n limit of a quantum
mechanical supersymmetric u(n) yang-mills model called matrix theory [1]. since the
time of this conjecture many computations have been performed to test the proposal [2].
we here wish to focus on the particle like excitations of matrix theory, namely the 11-dim
supergravity multiplet, and review a setup which enables one to compute various s-matrix
elements amongst them [3, 4]. these amplitudes are then shown to agree with the corre-
sponding tree-level amplitudes of the low energy supergravity theory, thus demonstrating
that matrix theory indeed has d=11 supergravity as its low energy limit. we emphasize
that it is possible to perform this comparison on the familiar level of feynman diagram
amplitudes in momentum space, in particular there is no need to revert to the calcula-
tion of eective source-probe potentials on the supergravity side once one employs our
denition of the matrix theory s-matrix. this approach appears to be mandatory once
one intends to go beyond the tree-level (classical) approximation to study quantum cor-
rections to the eective m-theory action. after all this is the true challenge for matrix
theory, as the four and six point tree-level amplitudes are believed to be determined by
the large amount of supersymmetry in the problem [5].

the m-theory matrix model emerges as the reduction of 9+1 dimensional supersymmetric
u(n) yang-mills to 0+1 dimensions. in euclidean time the quantum mechanical action

u(n) matrices, (a = 1, . . . , 9 and  = 1, . . . , 16). moreover we employ a real symmetric
representation for the dirac matrices a in which the charge conjugation matrix c equals
unity. one proceeds to compute the background eld eective action by expanding the

gauge the quantum elds y a,  and a, as well as the ghost matrices c and c are then
integrated out of the path integral via a perturbative loop expansion. one nally arrives
at the eective background eld action taking the form

note that in the l loop eective potential (l) only the relative quantities vij = vi  vj,
rij(t) = vijt + bij and ij = i  j enter, t is the interaction time.
let us from now on concentrate on the u(2) model being relevant to two body interac-
tions. at one loop the eective potential reads (1) = v4
12/r12(t)7 + (12 -terms). in order
to compute the corresponding 4-point s-matrix of matrix theory, we prepare two incom-
ing and two outgoing states carrying the quantum numbers momentum p and polarization
h of the four particles involved in the scattering process. the s-matrix element is then
written as

we will return shortly to the precise nature of the polarization states |hi. in the above
integral one now changes variables to vi = (xi  xi)/t and bi = (xi + xi)/2 (i = 1, 2),
and performs the emerging vi integrals via stationary phase in the relevant t   limit.

where the generalized index m denotes m  {ab; abc; ab}, corresponding to the gravi-
ton, three-form and gravitino, respectively [8]. these states are built from the diagonal
entries 1 and 2, contrary to the eective potential in (1.6) depending only on 1  2.
however, via a fierz rearrangement we may always convert to fermion bilinears homoge-
nous in 1 or 2, as long as we restrict our attention to amplitudes involving bosons only.
the general case is a little bit more involved. whereas 1ab1 just acts as a so(9)

on the right hand side of (1.8) and (1.9) one must (anti)symmetrize (with unit weight)
over all indices according to the symmetry properties of the left hand sides of these
equations. given the algebra of (1.8) and (1.9) only a moderate amount of computer
algebra is now required to obtain any pure bosonic s-matrix element. we have computed
the 4-graviton amplitude [3] consisting of 66 terms as well as the 4-three form amplitude
[4] made out of 103 terms. due to lack of space we do not state the resulting amplitudes
here.

where fm n p q = 4[m cn p q], g = det gm n and m = 0, . . . , 10. perturbative quantum
gravity is studied by considering small uctuations hm n from the at metric m n , i.e.
gm n = m n +  hm n where  is the 11-dimensional gravitational coupling constant.
after employing (for example) the harmonic gauge n hn
n = 0 for the
graviton as well as the gauge m c m
n p = 0 for the antisymmetric tensor one derives the
bosonic propagators in a straightforward fashion. the relevant feynman diagrams for the
two amplitudes considered are the t = 2 p1  p1 channel ones, which dominate eikonal
physics. they are:

in order to make a comparison with the matrix theory results we need to rewrite our
supergravity t channel amplitudes in terms of physical transverse nine dimensional de-
grees of freedom. since we are considering the n = 2 discrete light cone quantisation
formulation [10] of the theory, we work in light cone coordinates and specialise to the case

of vanishing p momentum exchange. the kinematics of our 1 + 2  1 + 2 process

in units of the compactied radius r and where the 11-dim index m decomposes as
m = (+,, a). we then reduce to physical polarizations by setting h+m = 0 = ha

hm = pa ham as well as c+a = 0 = c+ab and cab =  1

resulting four graviton amplitude up to terms of order v2
