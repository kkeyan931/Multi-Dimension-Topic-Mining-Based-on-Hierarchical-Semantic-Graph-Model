(3.1) (3.2) careful calculation anticommutator {q, q } recovers usual momentum term, also total derivative given (a a), abcz d3x  . (3.3) similar central term arises theories admit supersymmetric string solutions, in- cluding many supergravity theories , n = 1 susy gauge theories abelian gauge group factors non-vanishing f-i parameters . static string (or multi-string) solutions tension determined value central charge a, preserve half supersymmetry hamiltonian. analogous partially supersymmetric states exist theory considering, must look dierent, since clearly lagrangian cannot admit string solutions nite tension. would like know whether bps states chiral n = 1 theories nonzero value central term a. shall see rest paper, answer yes. nd theories chiral superelds, central term admits interpretation string charge rather junction charge. 4d eld theory two disconnected vacua, domain walls may meet one-dimensional junctions. theory supersymmetric, 3 demonstrate junctions 1/2-supersymmetric domain walls may stable junction solutions preserving 1/4 supersymmetry hamiltonian. point onwards, assume junction state static translationally invariant direction x3. conguration, magnitude central term plays role additional contribution mass junction, beyond contributed half-walls themselves. is, spokes junction tension associated them, hub non-vanishing contribution total energy, contrast string junctions {$9607201$}. familiar examples central charges susy algebras, central term arises semiclassical level topological term entering classical bps bound. see this, note hamiltonian static congurations, h = z d3x  , (3.4) rewritten, phase , sum positive denite terms total derivative term: h = r d3x  = r d3x(cid:20)(x3)(x3) + 4(z +2 z(w ) + 2z(w ) + z(z z) + z(z z)] w ()) 1 2 w ())(z 1 2 (3.5) since mass given region equal positive denite term plus surface term, imposes classical bps lower bound mass region terms values elds boundary. positive denite terms set zero (which turn precisely impose bps equations static conguration) total mass state becomes surface term. upon integral nd rst pair surface terms (involving superpotential) gives contribution mass corresponding central charge z a, second pair gives contribution corresponding central charge a. later convenience, note calculation easily generalized case nontrivial kahler metric k. case, relevant surface terms energy 2z(w ) + 2z(w ) + z(k,z k,z) + z(k,z k,z) . (3.6) 4 therefore, mass contributed junction charge equal line integral pullback one-form ik,d ik,d, or, equivalently: junction mass proportional area eld space spanned elds solution, measured kahler metric. although, unlike masses domain walls themselves, mass junction protected supersymmetry perturbative quantum corrections, still compact useful result, shall use later derive interesting quantitative prediction behavior certain states m-theory. iv. domain wall junctions: z3 case order understand subtleties involved constructing 1/4-bps states, let us specialize simplest nontrivial example, case n = 3. superpotential (2.1) becomes w = 2 4 4 , (4.1) theory three supersymmetric vacua i, ii, iii, scalar component takes vacuum expectation values = , ii = e2i/3 , iii = e2i/3 . (4.2) wish consider initial eld conguration tends values three dierent directions, gure 1. allow eld radiate away energy, settle stable conguration whose topology junction three half-walls meeting 120 angles. analyze much supersymmetry may preserved conguration. first, consider supercharges left unbroken individual half-wall. changes ~w r d3x ~w superpotential across walls vacua ii, vacua ii iii, vacua iii i, 3 2 , 1 2 ~wi,ii = ~wii,iii = (0,1, 0) (cid:18)exp ~wiii,i = 3 2 1 2 , 2i , 0!

(5.6) (5.7) straightforward check isolated bps wall, kinetic potential energies solution equal, must hold well junction solution order l1. since dz dz = 2idx dy, equation says total mass 9 enclosed contour c, 1/4-supersymmetric junction state, given order l1 contour integral menclosed = iic (w dz w dz) . (5.8) reformulation bps equations immediately yields useful set restrictions statics wall junctions. assuming walls saturate bps bound = 2|w|, (5.9) taking l matching terms order l1, nd wall must oriented w real positive, phase characterizing orientation wall complex plane. thus, since wi,ii, wii,iii, wiii,i dier phase 1200, means orientations walls z-z plane must also dier amount. therefore, integral forms bps equations conrm reasonable physical expectations angles walls must meet, based balance forces junction. although z3 symmetry particular case makes statics particularly simple, straightforward check integral form bps equations yields consistent picture arbitrary superpotential multiple vacua: relative angles walls junction must arranged cancel total force junction point. therefore, theories four disconnected supersymmetric vacua, argue unless may exist full moduli spaces domain wall networks, gure 3. caution, however, moduli space may exist beyond limit; low-frequency dynamics space governed 1 + 1-dimensional eld theory single supercharge, allows existence potentials. question existence nonexistence potentials lies beyond scope paper. remains open question whether exists topological index count number moduli directly, done moduli spaces self-dual instantons, monopoles, bps states susy theories. last note junctions described paper bear rough resemblance string

formal long-distance limits junction lattices preserve supersymmetry. however since doubly periodic holomorphic functions one variable necessarily singular, one would resolve singularities new degrees

superpotential w (z, z) break function w (z, z) ever attains value w () vanishes. caveats, however, really blessings disguise. obstructions, one could clearly start energy density distributions reasonable interpretation junction state network thereof, use generate 1/4-bps states. another, subtle, property function w (z, z) must satisfy bps junction network. bps equation single static wall, k~n ~ = w (), (6.1) ~n direction normal wall phase, means imaginary part w remains constant bps wall trajectory is, trajectory w -plane single domain wall solution always straight line segment

however able nd energy density prole allowed us solve poisson equation closed form conguration. instead, turn case simple closed-form solution exist, veriably correct properties describe well- behaved

natural guess prole function w (z, z) z4-symmetric four-wall junction: (2 2i)3 w = (6.3) 5 (tanh{(z + z)} tanh{i(z z)}) note initial prole indeed map combined discrete spatial rotation r-symmetry

(6.5) (6.6) sensible metric, function k must real non-degenerate. check this, point requirement k real equivalent requirement (z)w () = (z)w () (6.7) however, superpotential written w = za(z, z) = exp( real function 4 ) 222 =  , (6.8) 5 may therefore infer k(z, z) indeed everywhere real. moreover, gradient w everywhere non-vanishing interior bps polygon, means k real nonzero, thus positive denite z, z. therefore, since theory contains one chiral supereld, metric dened way satises kahler condition trivially. 14 hence, demonstrated that, choice reasonable metric su- perpotential (6.2), exists domain wall junction preserving single supercharge. remains note map (z, z) plane bps polygon nonsingular one-to-one. thus could formally re-express metric positive denite function , could derived kahler potential kinitial. developed existence proof nontrivial kahler metric, may wonder case trivial metric. present partial answer question. let k(t; , ) (1 t)kinitial(, ) + .
