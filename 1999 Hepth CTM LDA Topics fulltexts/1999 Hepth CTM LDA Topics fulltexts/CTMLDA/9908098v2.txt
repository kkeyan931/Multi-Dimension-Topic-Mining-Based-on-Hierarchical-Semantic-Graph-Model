abstract

from the algebraic treatment of the quasi-solvable systems, and a q-
deformation of the associated su(2) algebra, we obtain exact solutions for the
q-deformed schrodinger equation with a 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic
oscillator potential.

introduction

in spite of the fact that the schrodinger equation was introduced many years
ago, the development of techniques, and specially, algebraic techniques, elab-
orated with the purpose of solving this equation, is still a living subject.
between the most remarkable and general works done to this date we can
mention the following ones: 1. - the so(2,2) treatment for the hypergeomet-
ric natanzon potentials [1], studied by alhassid et al [2]. 2. - the susyqm
method for the shape-invariant potentials by gendeshtein, cooper, dutt [3].
3. - the so(2,1) treatment for the hypergeometric-conuent natanzon po-
tentials studied in [4]. 4. - the partial algebraization method, which allows
to obtain part of the spectrum for the so-called quasi-solvable systems, as
we can see in [5]. we should also mention the works done by kostelecky,
nieto and manko, about algebraic descriptions including spin [6].

the following question arises: what can be done in the context of de-
formations? in other words, is it possible to extend some of the previous
approaches to include quantum groups?

at this point we mention the works done by: dayi and duru (coulomb
and morse potentials) [7], cooper (morse) [8], daskaloyannis et al (morse)
[9], de freitas and salamo (poschl-teller i and ii) [10]. the references [7],
[8] and [9] are related to the algebraic treatments of the classical systems.
in particular, it would be interesting to obtain algebraic solutions for
the q-schrodinger equation. this is, a schrodinger equation in which the
usual commutation relation between the position and momentum operators,
[x, p ] = i, is substituted by xp  qp x = i, which can be done by asso-
ciating the momentum operator to the deformed derivative, instead to the
usual one, as we will see later on.

in this paper we work out such an algebraic method for the particular
case in which the potential is a 3-dimensional q-harmonic oscillator. by
q-harmonic oscillator we mean a q-dependent potential that reduces to the
usual harmonic oscillator in the proper limit of q (q  1). the method is
strongly based on the ideas of partial algebraization. it relies on the use of
a particular deformation of the su(2) algebra (a quadratic one), which we
call dn
q (su(2)). in the same spirit of the partial algebraization method, we
express the hamiltonian of the system in terms of the generators dening
this dn
q (su(2)) q-algebra. this allows us to obtain exact solutions for part
of the spectrum as well as the corresponding eigenfunctions.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we make a review of the
partial algebraization method. this is required to understand what follows
in the paper, though it is a somewhat long section, so in order to avoid
confusion, the reader should keep in mind that our goal is the algebraization
of the q-schrodinger equation with a q-harmonic oscillator. this is the
central point of section 3 as well as the main part of this paper.
in the
mentioned section 3 we dene and construct the dn
q (su(2)) algebra. after
rotating the q-schrodinger equation, in analogy with what is done in the
partial algebraization method, we continue the analogy, relating this rotated
equation with a quadratic plus a linear expression of the generators dening
q (su(2)). in section 4 we use a particular representation of dn
dn
q (su(2)) to
show how we can get the so desired exact solutions of our q-schrodinger
equation. next, some particular examples are shown. finally, in section 5
we discuss the obtained results.

2 partial algebraization

the idea of the method of partial algebraization [5] consists in to express
the schrodinger equation

d2

dx2 + (v (x)  e)! (x) = 0

(1)

in terms of the generators of su(2). this can be done by rst doing a
non-unitary transformation on (1) in the following way

thus (1) is now given by

with

where

hg =

a2(x)

and a(x) is dened as

a(x) =

da(x)

dx

the realization for the su(2) algebra is taken to be

j+ = 2ju  u2 d

du

,

j0 = j +

d
du

,

j =

d
du

with the usual commutation relations: [j+, j] = 2j0, [j0, j+] = j+, [j0, j] =
j. the index j labels the representations of dimensions 2j+1. the carrier
space is given by monomials of degree n on the variable u, i.e., un. by other
hand, since the eigenvalues of j0 lies between j and j , then 0  n  2j,
thus the representation space rj is given by

rj = {1, u, u2, ...u2j}

(8)

the algebraization of the schrodinger equation is made assuming that

the hamiltonian hg given in (4), may be written as

3

hg = xa,b=0,,ab

cabjajb + xa,b=0,

caja

where cab and ca are constants. we obtain

hg =

p4(u)

d2
du2 + p3(u)

d
du

+ p2(u)

with p4(u), p3(u) and p2(u) given by

(9)

(10)

p4(u) = 2c++u4 + 2c+u3 + 2(c+  c00)u2  2c0u  2c
p3(u) = 2c++(1  2j)u3 + ((3j  1)c+0  c+)u2

+(2jc+ + (1  2j)c00 + c0)u  jc0 + c

p2(u) = 2j(2j  1)c++u2 + 2j(c+  jc+0)u + j2c00  jc0

(11)

a more compact form can be achieved if we dene a new set of parameters
as follows

a4 = 2c++,
a0 = 2c,
b0 = jc0 + c,

a3 = 2c+0,
b2 = c+  jc+0,

c0 = j2c00  jc0

a2 = 2(c+  c00),

a1 = 2c0

b1 = 2jc+ + (1  2j)c00 + c0

(12)

therefore (11) is now given as

p4(u) = a4u4 + a3u3 + a2u2 + a1u + a0
p3(u) = (2j  1)a4u3 + ((j 
p2(u) = j(1  2j)a4u2 + 2jb2u + c0

1
2

)a3  b2)u2 + b1u + b0

(13)

we now proceed to identify the expressions for hg given in (4) and (10).
since the variables x and u are involved, a change of variables must be done,
as follows

(u)du = (u)

(14)

which also allows to eliminate the term multiplying the second derivative in
(10). in this way we get

x =z p

(15)

the substitution u = 1(x) has to be done in the polynomials occurring
in (10). furthermore, p
4(u) is the derivative of p4(u) respect to u with the
subsequent substitution of u as a function of x.



we can see now more clearly the reason for transforming the schrodinger
equation with the non-unitary operator ea(x), since as a consequence of
that, we get a term with rst derivative which makes possible the identi-
cation of (4) and (10). from this identication we get

a(x) =

the set of parameters characterizing this potential are: a4, a3, a2, a1, a0, b2,
b1, b0 and c0.

let us see now how this algebraization lead us to the energy spectrum
and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the potential obtained in (18). since
the carrier space of su(2) is given by (8), then a basis for the eigenfunctions
of hg is

{e} = {1, u, u2, ...u2j}  {e2j+2,e2j+3...}

where {e2j+2,e2j+3...} is orthogonal to rj. so, the matrix representation

of hg is given by

(19)

hg =  hg1

0

0

hg2 !

(20)

where hg1 is the matrix associated to rj and hg2 is an innite matrix
associated to the second subspace, which is unknown. therefore, since hg1

5

is a hermitic matrix of dimension (2j + 1)  (2j + 1), it is possible to diag-
onalize it, obtaining a part of the energy spectrum and their corresponding
eigenfunctions. this is the reason why the potentials treated in this way are
known as quasi-solvables, since only a part of the spectra may be obtained.
nevertheless, it is possible to nd the complete spectra with this technique
for some potentials, as we will see later.

the eigenfunctions of hg1 will be linear combinations of elements of rj,

therefore if hg1e = ee, then e(u) = p2j(u), where p2j(u) is a polynomial

on u of degree 2j. using (2,6,16), the eigenfunctions of hg1 turns out to be
of the form

(u) = e(x)ea(x) = p2j(u(x))e

and the corresponding eigenvalues are obtained after the diagonalization of
hg1.

let us see one example. let us take: a4 = a3 = a1 = a0 = c0 = 0.

thus p4(u) = a2u2, from (14) we get

u = ekx

with k = a2. the potential for this set of parameters is obtained from (18)
and is given by

v (x) =

in the case j = 0, the representation space will be simply r0 = {1}, and
we will nd only one energy eigenvalue: e0 = 0 with 0 = ea(x) its cor-
responding eigenstate. if j = 1
2 we have then r1/2 = {1, u}. representing
each element of this space (i.e., 1 and u) by |0i and |1i respectively, we
have then the following matrix elements: h0|hg| 0i = 0, h0|hg| 1i = b0 ,
h1|hg| 0i = b2, and h1|hg| 1i = b1. so, the expression for hg1 in a matrix
representation is given by

hg1 =  0

with the corresponding eigenstates

where a(x) is given in (23) and n is a normalization constant. notice that
if we set
b2 = 0 in (22) we obtain the morse potential which is exactly
solvable. we expect then that with a proper choice of parameters one could
obtain certain potentials that can be solved in a closed form, this is the
point that we would like to discuss now.

we can nd a general class of potentials that are exactly solvable through
this method if we take the potential (18) to be independent of j. after
a tedious calculation one nd the following conditions for the coecients
occurring in (18)

2(a2b2 + a4b0) + a3b1  a4a1 = 0,
2(2a1b2 + a3b0)  a3a1  4a4a0 = 0
a3b2 + 2a4b1 = 0
a0(a3  2b2) = 0,
a4a0 = 0,

a4a1 = 0,

a2
3  4a4a2 = 0

this system has only one interesting solution and is given by

substituting (25) in (18) we obtain for v (x)

a4 = a3 = b2 = 0

the expression for v (x) given in (26) is the most general one that can

be completely algebrized using the su(2) algebra.

under the conditions that we have imposed , the rotated hamiltonian

hg (15) turns out to be

(a2u2 + a1u + a0)

hg =

we get the correct expressions for the energy eigenvalues for each potential,

3 algebraization of the q-scrhodinger equation through

dn
q (su(2))

we would like to use the ideas of the partial algebraization method presented
in the preceding section to solve the q-deformed schrodinger equation. a
deformation is done after associating the momentum operator p to a de-
formed derivative. then the standard commutation relation between the
momentum and the position operator x is replaced by

xp  qp x = i

in this way we assume that a q-deformed schrodinger equation is given by

(cid:18)

1
2

d2

q + (vq(x)  e)(cid:19) q = 0

(31)

where the deformed derivative is given by

dq(x) =

(x)  (qx)

(1  q) x

in this paper we will obtain exact solutions of (31), for the particular
case in which the potential vq(x) is a q-deformed harmonic oscillator, using
algebraic techniques. for this purpose we will use the dn
q (su(2)) algebra
to be dened later on. a realization of this algebra is obtained from the
su(2) algebra that was used in the preceding section (7) after a change
of variables. as it was seen before, we had to change variables in order to
equate the rotated hamiltonian with the combinations of generators given in
(9). the change of variables that we are going to use is a simple one, namely
u = xn. this is done for simplicity in order to avoid the complications that
arise when one consider the general case. for this case, we have that (7)

it is straightforward to prove that the new set of generators satisfy the

following commutations relations

is easy to verify that the delbecq-quesne [12] condition for the existence

of the casimir operator

h(j0)  h(j0  g(j0)) = f (j0)

(40)

is satised.

our next goal is the algebraization of (31) following the steps of the

preceding section. we rst perform a rotation of the form

q(x) = q(x)f (a(x))

where f (a(x)) is such that

dqf (a(x)) = dq(a(x))f (a(x))

(41)

(42)

in analogy with the undeformed case where f was the exponential. in what
follows we will use the following notation

using the fact that (f g)

in this way (51) and (52) provide us with six equations relating c+0 , c+,
c00 , c0, c+ , c0 and c with the set {, [l], q, j}. since we have a
set of six linear equations and seven variables, we will be free to choose one
of those variables at will. specically, looking at the equations, we can see
that c+0, c+, c0 and c are xed, and one of the variables c00, c0 and

13

c+ will be free, and xing one of them we x the others two. this freedom
on one of the variables corresponds in the classical (non-deformed) case, to
the freedom that we have in choosing the ground state of the system.

from (53) we get v (x). we then need the coecients c+0 and c+.
the expression for c+0 is given by (51) and then from (52) we obtain for

c+ = 2(1  q)(6j(1 + q)  3q  1)

then from (52) v (x) is nally given by

v (x) = 2

we can say that v (x) correspond to a q-deformed harmonic oscillator
with a q-deformed angular frequency q and with a q-deformed angular
momentum. notice that in the limit q  1 we obtain the classical potential.

4 deformed spectrum and eigenfunctions

as we mentioned before, the carrier space of su (2), i.e. rj, is given
in the classical case by monomials on the variable u. this was the original
variable dening the algebra, see (7) and (8). we can use this basis in the
deformed case. since we have chosen a change of variables given by u = x2,
the monomials will be of the form x2k (k integer), these are represented as
|ki. then from (33) we have

j+ |ki = (cid:18)2j 
j0 |ki = (cid:18)j 
j |ki =

[2k]
2 |k  1i

[2k]

2 (cid:19)|k + 1i
2 (cid:19)|ki

j = 1

if

4 [2m] for some integer m, the representation will be nite-
dimensional, otherwise will be innite-dimensional and bounded below. since
we have expressed hg in terms of the generators of the algebra, then we can
represent it as a matrix acting on the corresponding basis. if the represen-
tation is innite-dimensional it will be too hard to diagonalize hg in order
to obtain the spectrum, therefore, we will work with the nite case, so we
have only to diagonalize a nite matrix as happened in the classical case.

according to (41), the eigenfunctions will be of the form,

(x) = p (x2)f (a(x))

where p (x2) is a polynomial on x2.our next task is to evaluate the function
f (a(x)). let us write f (a(x)) = xl+1f (x), then from equations (42) and
(50) we get

we obtain

[l + 1]

x (cid:19) f (x)
dq(xl+1f (x)) =(cid:18)x +
ql+1xl+1dq(f (x)) = xl+2f (x)

if we write f (x) as a power series f (x) =

found to satisfy the following conditions

pn=0

(58)

nxn, the coecients n are

hence

n = 
= 0,



ql+1[n]

n2,

for n even

for n odd

2n = 0(cid:18)

(1 + q)

ql+1 (cid:19)n

1

[n]q2!

where 0 is arbitrary and [n]q2 is dened in the same way as [n], but with
the replacement q  q2, and the factorial means
[n]q2! = [n]q2[n  1]q2 
with these results we see that the function f (x) is

f (x) =

1

[n]q2!(cid:18)

(1 + q)

ql+1 x2(cid:19)n

xn=0

15

which is a deformed exponential with deformation parameter q2 and with
argument  (1+q)

ql+1 x2. so the function f (a(x)) turns out to be

f (a(x)) = xl+1 expq2(cid:18)

(1 + q)

ql+1 x2(cid:19)

(59)

where we have set 0 = 1.

in order to evaluate the energy spectrum we need the matrix elements
of the deformed hamiltonian. these elements are easy to compute from the
expressions (46) together with (55), (56) and (57), we get

hn|hg| ki = (cid:18)2j 

[2k]

[2k]

+ c+(cid:18) [2k]

+ c0(cid:18)j +

[2k]

2 (cid:19)! n,k

to illustrate the method, lets see some examples. the simplest possible
4 [2]. in the case j = 0 we have obviously one energy

cases are j = 0 and j = 1
eigenvalue, which is e = 0 and its corresponding eigenfunction is then

0(x) = xl+1 expq2(cid:18)

(1 + q)

ql+1 x2(cid:19)

4 [2] = 1

for j = 1
4 (1 + q), the representation space will be of dimension 2
and will be given by rj = {1, x2}. as it was said before, we still have a
free parameter (c+, c00 or c0). for convenience, we choose the xing
condition given by

c00j  c0 = 0

in this way, the matrix representation of hg1 is nicely given by

hg1 =

0

2j(c  jc0)
2j(c+  jc+0) 2j(c0 + 2jc+)



(61)

so obtaining the values for c+0, c+, c0, c+, c0 and c from (51)
and (52), substituting them in the above matrix, and diagonalizing it, we
can get two energy eigenvalues for the system in question, as well as the
corresponding eigenfunctions. the two eigenvalues are the following ones:

16

eq =(cid:18)p1[l + 1] + p2  2qp3[l + 1]2 + p4[l + 1] + p5(cid:19) (1 + q)

8q



where pi, i = 1 . . . 5, are polynomials on q given by

p1 = 2(q2 + 1)(q  1)2
p2 = 2q(3q  1)
p3 = (1 + q)2(q  1)6
p4 = 2q(1 + 2q)(1 + q)2(q  1)3
p5 = q2(1 + q)(4q2  3q + 1)

we can see that in the limit q  1 we get the expected eigenvalues for

the resulting potential:

v (x) 

1
2

2x2 +

i.e.

l(l + 1)

2x2 +(cid:18) 3

2  l(cid:19) 

eq  0
eq+  2

it is possible also to get the eigenfunctions associated to each eigenvalue.

they will be of the form

(x) =(cid:16)a + bx2(cid:17) xl+1 expq2(cid:18)

(1 + q)

ql+1 x2(cid:19)

where a and b are some complicated functions of  and [l + 1], which
we will not show here.

5 final comments

we have seen how using a q-algebra of the kind studied in [12] we can get
exact solutions for part of the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the
q-schrodinger equation in the case in which the potential is a 3-dimensional
q-deformed harmonic oscillator. the deformation of the potential is a very
specic one, i.e. with a very specic q-dependence, as shown in (54). we

17

could also want to construct any q-dependent potential such that in the limit
q  1 we get the usual classical potential. our solution is only valid for the
specic case we was considering, so a general solution for any possible choice
of the q-dependence remains as an open and very hard question. even harder
is to consider potentials others than a harmonic oscillator, like the morse
potential or so. this is because of the somehow complicated properties of
the deformed derivative.

a remarkable aspect of our solution is the fact that we can get only part
of the spectrum, the rest remaining unknown. this shouldnt be too aston-
ishing, after all our method is based on the ideas of partial algebraization,
which in most of the cases allows us to get only part of the spectrum, the
only exceptions being the ones studied at the end of section 2. nevertheless,
considering that one of those exceptions was precisely the harmonic oscil-
lator, it is curious that we cannot get the whole spectrum in the deformed
case, but only a part of it.
