abstract:

bosonization of the gauged, massive thirring model in 2+1-dimensions produces a maxwell-
chern-simons gauge theory, coupled to a dynamical, massive vector eld. exploiting the master
lagrangian formalism, two dual theories are constructed, one of them being a gauge theory.
the full two-point functions of both the interacting elds are computed in the path integral
quantization scheme. furthermore, some new dual models, derived from the original master
lagrangian and valid for dierent regimes of coupling parameters, are constructed and analysed
in details.

introduction:

the notion of duality has played a key role in the common goal of unication in physics.
broadly, two particular models are said to be dual to each other if in some sense they are
equivalent to each other as regards to, e.g. eective action, greens function, etc.. one way of
obtaining a pair of dual systems is to consider the so called master lagrangian [1] of a model
of larger phase space, from which each of the dual models are derivable. the presence of the
master lagrangian assures the equivalence of the said (dual) models. the other more direct
way is to derive one model from another one - such as bosonization (in 1+1-dimensions), where
a fermionic model, e.g.
the massive thirring model (mtm) was shown to be dual to the
(bosonic) sine-gordon model [2].

recently there has been a marriage of sorts between these two approaches in higher (2+1)
dimensions. early works [3] in 2+1-dimensional bosonization were not completely satisfactory,
as the fermion-boson mapping was plagued with non-locality. however, the programme received
an impetus from later works [4], where a local bosonic action for the mtm is obtained at the
cost of truncating the seelay expansion of the fermion determinant at one loop. the small
parameter in the expansion is the inverse of fermion mass.

in a recent paper [5], we have been able to bosonize the gauged massive thirring model
(gmtm). the spectrum of the bosonic model, a gauge theory, was obtained in a classical
setup [5]. the present work is devoted to a quantum analysis of the bosonized gmtm. exact
two-point functions of the gmtm are derived. the concept of duality is utilised in two ways:
on the one hand to generate the full propagators of gmtm and on the other hand, to establish
the equivalence between several (manifestly) gauge invariant models with non-invariant ones.
the latter phenomenon is reminiscent of the duality between abelian self-dual and maxwell-
chern-simons models [6], and non-abelian self-dual and yang-mills-chern-simons models [7].
the rest of this section is devoted to a brief elaboration of the computational scheme adopted.
in section ii, the gmtm and its bosonized version is stated from previous works [5]. the
lagrangian of gmtm, lf (, a, m, e, g) consists of the following parameters: the fermion ()
mass m, the gauge eld (a) coupling e and the thirring coupling g. the bosonized version
has lb(b, a, m, e, g) where b is an auxiliary vector eld introduced to linearize the thirring
interaction. the latter model is our master lagrangian (ml). note that the duality between
lf and lb is not exact, for reasons mentioned earlier.

in section iii we derive the dual partition functions z(a) and z(b), via integrating
out b and a (in the lorentz gauge) from ml respectively. this produces an exact duality
between z(a), a gauge invariant theory, and z(b), a non-invariant one.

the dual system helps us to compute the full propagators < aa > and < bb > of ml.
limiting values of the parameters are studied to show the consistency of the above framework.
this is the content of section iv.

section v comprises of some more dual models, one of the pairs (of a dual system) being
a gauge theory. all these models are derived from the starting ml, the distinction being the
relative strengths of the couplings e and g. once again greens functions of these models are
derived.

we end the paper with a brief conclusion in section vi.

ii. bosonized model

our starting point is the gauged massive thirring model,

lf = i(  iea)  m  +

 .

g
2

(1)

here a is an external, abelian gauge eld and g is the thirring coupling constant. the system
has abelian gauge invariance under,

  exp(ie), a  a + .

notice that no kinetic terms for a, (e.g. maxwell or chern-simons term), are present in (1) to
give dynamics to the photon. however this is no restriction since we will study the bosonized
version of (1), where the kinetic terms corresponding to a will be automatically generated in
the seelay expansion of the fermion determinant. hence the coecients of the starting kinetic
terms, (if present), will get renormalized anyway after bosonization.

we now introduce an auxiliary eld b to linearize the thirring interaction,

lf = i[  i(b + ea)]  m  

1
2g

bb.

the partition function to be evaluated is

zb = z d( )exp(iz lf ).

(2)

(3)

unlike in 1+1-dimensions, the fermion determinant is non-local and conventionally one com-
putes the one loop expression in a power series with inverse fermion mass, (i.e. 1
m), as the small
parameter. keeping the m-independent and o( 1

m) terms only we obtain,

lb = 

a
4

(b + ea)(b + ea) +


2

(b + ea)(b + ea) 

1
2g

bb,

(4)

where  = 1/(4) and a = 1/(24m). in the present work, we treat the above lb in (4) as
our ml and the analysis actually begins here. the ml has an invariance under local gauge
transformation of a. the partion function corresponding to (4) in lorentz gauge is

z = z d(a, b)(a)expi[

a
4

(b + ea)(b + ea)

+

(b + ea)(b + ea) 

1
2g

bb + ja + lb].

(5)

the source current j is conserved (j  = 0), but there is no such restriction on the source cur-
rent l. the classical analysis including the spectrum of this model has already been discussed
in [5]. at present we are interested in the quantum green functions (gf) < a(x)a(y) >
and < b(x)b(y) > of the model. this will be achieved by the introduction of two dual
lagrangians, obtained by selective integration of the a and b elds respectively.

3

iii. dual lagrangians

our objective is to integrate out a and b separately from the ml. since a is a gauge

eld, the computations have been carried out in a particular (lorentz) gauge, so that

the eective action is rewritten as,

a = o.

z = z d(b)expi[

h = ea b + eb + j.

 is the gauge parameter. let us dene,

d1

e2 [pg + q + r].

demanding dd1

e2q =

(p 2 + r22)(p + q2)

42  a(2  a)2

2(a2(2)2 + 422)

.

after integration of a we are left with,

zb(b) = z d(b)expiz [(

even though the source free expression of z(b) looks trivial with only a contact term in b,
the green functions are quite involved, as we will demonstrate in the next section.

in a similar way, we now carry out the b integration. no gauge xing is required here.

the .a terms in (6) have been displayed to show the manifest gauge invariance but they are
dropped later since lorentz gauge has been adopted. thus we have established an exact duality
between the complicated gauge invariant eective action in (15) and the more simpler looking
one in (9). it should be kept in mind that the duality regarding the original fermion model in
(1) and its bosonized version in (5),(as mentioned before), was not exact. on the other hand,
the just exposed duality is exact since they both originate from the same master lagrangian in
(5) and no further approximation are involved so far. the next task is to compute the a and
b gfs by exploiting the latter duality.

iv. greens functions

the sources present in (5) allow us to formally dene the gfs,

but thanks to the duality we can replace zb by zb(a) or zb(b). using zb(b) in (10) we

in a similar way, performing the variation ( 1

from the above coupled green functions, we can derive green function identities containing
exclusively a or b elds, which are given below in a compact form.

the operator m (x) acts on x and is dened below,

for the sake of comparison, we also write down the propagators for the maxwell- chern-simons
model,

lm cs =

aa + aa + ja,

.j = 0,

a

and the maxwell-chern-simons-proca model,

(26)

it is imperative to check the consistency of the above procedure through a qualitative analysis
of (20) and (21), by considering limiting values of the parameters involved, specically the
fermion mass m and the thirring coupling g.

the bosonization result was obtained in the large m limit. in keeping conformity with that,
it is natural to keep only o(m1) terms and hence a2  0. indeed, this choice is by no means
mandatory, since the bosonized ml is an independent eld theory by itself. first we consider
the large g limit and keep terms of o(a, g1) only in the greens functions.

if we consider g-independent terms only, the a and b propagators become identical, but for
an overall factor of 1
2 in the c-number expressions. this is also the same as the lm cs propagator
in (25). this is consistent with the fact that in the master lagrangian in (5), the dierence
between a and b disappears as g   and the model tends to lm cs in the composite eld
(b + ea).

in case of small g, we have   1, m1  2 and m3  2. this reproduces the following

approximate propagators,

< b(x)b(y) > ig(x  y),

e2 < a(x)a(y) > i[

(29)

(30)

notice that the a-propagator in (29) is identical to the mcs propagator in (25). this be-
haviour is justied in the limit of small g where the mass term for b in (4) becomes innite
and hence the b eld eectively decouples. this is also the reason for trivial form of the b
propagator in (29).

we now consider two dierent mls, which can be thought of as large or small e-the elec-

tromagnetic coupling limit of the original ml in (4) considered in the beginning.

in case of a integration, the gauge xing is really not necessary since a appears only linearly
in the action. the a equation of motion produces the relation

where the operator m (x) is the same as in (22). the b green function is obtained from the
above one by replacing a by b/(2e). the reason is that the variation by i/j reproduces
a and b/(2e) when operated upon z1 and z1(b) respectively.

vi: conclusions

bosonized version of the gauged, massive thirring model is analysed exhaustively at the
level of eective action. duality invariance is used to construct exactly equivalent gauge invari-
ant and non-invariant models. the correlation functions of the bosonized models are studied.
validity of this new scheme to achieve this is tested in dierent coupling regimes. depending
on the relative strengths of the electromagnetic and thirring couplings, some new dual models,
including their propagators, are also presented.
