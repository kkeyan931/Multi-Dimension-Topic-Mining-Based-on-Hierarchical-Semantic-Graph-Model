abstract

we present a direct eld theoretical calculation of the consistent gauge anomaly

in the supereld formalism, on the basis of a denition of the eective action

through the covariant gauge current. the scheme is conceptually and techni-

cally simple and the gauge covariance in intermediate steps reduces calculational

labors considerably. the resultant supereld anomaly, being proportional to the
anomaly dabc = tr t a{t b, t c}, is minimal even without supplementing any coun-

terterms. our anomaly coincides with the anomaly obtained by marinkovic as the

solution of the wess-zumino consistency condition.

the consistent gauge anomaly [1] might be conceptually more natural than

the covariant gauge anomaly [2], as it is dened as the gauge non-invariance of the

eective action of the chiral fermion [3,4]. the consistent anomaly is important

because it provides information on the wess-zumino lagrangian [3]. to nd an ex-

plicit form of the consistent anomaly, one may appeal to the algebraic-geometrical

technique [5-8] or directly perform a eld theoretical calculation with, say, the

pauli-villars regularization. as is well-known, however, both approaches can be

cumbersome for a theory in higher dimensions, or for a theory with a complicated

gauge transformation.

in particular, in the eld theoretical calculation, gauge

non-invariant normal terms (fake anomalies) generally appear. then, to extract

the intrinsic anomaly, one has to nd suitable local counterterms to eliminate these

normal terms.

the covariant gauge anomaly, on the other hand, has the quite restricted pos-

sible form due to the gauge covariance. the necessary calculational labors are con-

sequently considerably less. therefore, a practically useful calculational scheme

might be formulated if it is possible to relate the consistent anomaly with the

covariant anomaly (or with a certain gauge covariant expression).

in ref. [9],

banerjee, banerjee and mitra gave a eld theoretical prescription which provides

this kind of calculational scheme. this prescription leads to the basically equiv-

alent consequence as the result due to bardeen and zumino [4], and that due to

leutwyler [10]. however, the prescription of ref. [9] is more straightforward and


exible.

in this letter, we give a direct eld theoretical calculation of the consistent

gauge anomaly in supersymmetric theories, on the basis of the prescription of ref. [9].

in general, the treatment of the consistent anomaly with the supereld formal-

ism [1224] can be quite complicated, because the gauge transformation is highly

non-linear and because the gauge supereld has no mass dimension (i.e., an ar-

bitrary function of it is a candidate of the counterterm). the advantage of our

 it has even the application in chiral gauge theories on the lattice [11].

2

treatment in this letter is that the minimal supereld anomaly, being proportional
to the anomaly dabc = tr t a{t b, t c}, is directly obtained. this minimal-ness is

guaranteed by the basic property of the prescription of ref. [9]. naturally, the

resultant consistent anomaly coincides with that due to marinkovic [24], who ap-

plied the technique of ref. [4] to this problem. also our expressions below have

some resemblance with that of the work by mcarthur and osborn [23], in which

the formulation of ref. [10] was generalized to supersymmetric theories. how-

ever, it seems worthwhile to report on our eld theoretical calculation, because of

simplicity of the basic idea and simplicity of the treatment.

we consider the massless chiral supereld  coupled to the external vector
supereld v = v at a (t a is the representation of the gauge group). the classical

action is given by



s =z d8z ev .

(1)

in the prescription of ref. [9], the eective action is dened as follows. we rst

introduce an auxiliary gauge coupling parameter



g through v  gv . we may

dierentiate the eective action with respect to the parameter g and then integrate

it over this parameter. noting that the g-dependence arises only through the

combination gv and the original eective action is given by the value at g = 1, we

have the formal representation of the eective action,

 [v ] =

=

 [gv ]
gv a(z)

dg z d8z v a(z)
dg z d8z v a(z)(cid:28) s

v a(z)(cid:29)v gv

(2)

,

where the indication v  gv implies all v -dependences involved are replaced

 we basically follow the notational conventions of ref. [25]. our particular conventions and

useful identities are summarized in the appendix a.

 as one would anticipate, this parameter g becomes the integration parameter appearing in

the homotopy formula [5-8,4].

3

by gv . the representation (2) is yet formal, because the regularization of the gauge
current hs/v a(z)i has to be specied. the crucial point of the prescription [9]

is to adopt the covariant gauge current as the gauge current. thus we introduce

the proper time cuto to regularize the gauge current gauge covariantly

(cid:28) s
v a(z)(cid:29) = lim

where the trace tr is taken over the full superspace d8z.

in this expression,

m denotes the cuto mass parameter



and we have used the formal expres-

sion of the propagator of the chiral supereld in presence of the vector supereld:
2ev (zz)/16. (for the derivation of the propagator,

2 1

see, for example, ref. [26].) note that all the derivatives , d  and m trans-
form as  = eiei under the gauge transformation ev 
ev ei [25];

= ei

thus these are gauge covariant object. due to the gauge covariant denition (3),

the gauge current transforms covariantly under the gauge transformation. namely,

we have

v a(z)(cid:29)
(cid:28) s

as is formally expected.

 one can generalize the regulator e + /m 2

in the last line as f ( + /m 2) where f (x) is
an arbitrary rapidly decreasing function with f (0) = 1. the result with f ( + /m 2) is
given by rst working with e + p/m 2
0 dp g(p), where g(p) is the
0 dp g(p)epx. our results in m   are
independent of m and thus of p. therefore, all the results are independent of the choice of

and then by multiplying r 

inverse laplace transformation of f (x): f (x) =r 
the regulator function f (x) in m  , because r 

0 dp g(p) = f (0) = 1.

4

the denition of the eective action (2) through the covariant current (3) is

perfectly legitimate. for uv convergent diagrams, it is equivalent to any conven-

tional denition. for uv diverging diagrams, it may gives a dierent value from

the conventional denition but only by an amount expressed as local counterterms,

because eq. (3) reduces to the conventional gauge current in the m   limit.

as we will see shortly, the consistent anomaly derived from the eective action (2)

with eq. (3) is directly related to the covariant anomaly. since the covariant
anomaly [27,23] is proportional to the anomaly dabc, the consistent anomaly thus
obtained is also proportional to dabc. this implies that, when the gauge represen-
tation of the chiral multiplet is anomaly-free, i.e., when dabc = 0, the regularized

eective action (2) with eq. (3) automatically restores the gauge invariance without

supplementing any counterterms. in this sense, a breaking of the gauge symmetry

is kept to be minimal [28].



the same mechanism works also when one starts

with the covariant current and then adds minimal corrections for ensuring the in-

tegrability of the whole current [10,23]. as noted in the introduction, however,

our treatment is simpler and more straightforward. note that the prescription (2)

and (3) is quite dierent from the direct proper time regularization of the eective

action [14,15].

now, from eq. (2), we can read o a variation of the eective action under the

innitesimal gauge transformation [25]

ev = ev i  iev ,

v = ilv /2 h( + ) + coth(lv /2)  (  )i.

(5)

 for anomaly-free cases, the prescription is equivalent [28] to the generalized pauli-villars
regularization introduced in refs. [29,30]. since this is a lagrangian level regularization, and
the corresponding hamiltonian is hermitian, the s-matrix is manifestly unitary. (negative
norm regulators cannot contribute to the physical s-matrix in the m   limit.)

we have

v b(z)(cid:28) s

v a(z)(cid:29)v gv

(6)

.

we then insert dg/dg = 1 to the rst term and perform the integration by parts

with respect to g. by noting again the g-dependence arises only through the

combination gv , we have the following representation of the consistent anomaly

 [v ] =z d8z v a(z)(cid:28) s

v b(z)(cid:29)(cid:21)(cid:27)v gv

it is obvious that this consistent anomaly satises the wess-zumino consistency

condition because it is variation of the eective action. eq. (7) shows the con-

sistent anomaly consists of two pieces: the rst piece is the covariant gauge

anomaly [27,23] which is obtained from eqs. (3) and (5) as

/4) and the chirality of the gauge param-

eter, d  = 0. we have also used the identity (a.3). due to the gauge covariance,

the calculation is quite simple. see ref. [27], or the appendix of ref. [26] for the

actual calculation of the third line in the plane wave basis. obviously the covariant
anomaly (8) is proportional to the anomaly dabc because , , w and w
lie algebra valued.


 are

the second piece in eq. (7), on the other hand, provides a dierence between

the consistent anomaly and the covariant anomaly [4]. the dierence is expressed

by the functional rotation of the covariant gauge current



v b(z)(cid:28) s

v a(z)(cid:29) 



v a(z)(cid:28) s

v b(z)(cid:29) .

(9)

the importance of this functional rotation has been noticed sometimes in various

context [810,31,23,32,11,33]. the functional rotation (9) possesses the following

property due to the gauge covariance (4):

z d8z v a(z)(cid:20)



v b(z)(cid:28) s

v a(z)(cid:29) 

=



v b(z)(cid:29)(cid:21)

v a(z)(cid:28) s
v b(z)z d8z v a(z)(cid:28) s



v a(z)(cid:29) .

(10)

the right hand side is nothing but the covariant anomaly (8). quite interest-

ingly, the functional rotation (9) is a local functional of the vector supereld, being
proportional to (derivatives of) the delta function (z  z). we will see this

shortly. therefore, eq. (10) implies that, when the covariant anomaly vanishes,
i.e., when dabc = 0, the functional rotation vanishes and consequently our consis-

tent anomaly (7) vanishes. thus the minimal-ness of the anomaly is guaranteed

by construction; this is the virtue of the prescription in ref. [9].

in non-super-

symmetric gauge theories, the relation corresponding to eq. (10) was solved [9]

with respect to the functional rotation (9).

instead, one may directly evaluate

eq. (9) as was performed in ref. [10]. here we adopt the latter approach that

seems much simpler for the present supersymmetric case. this approach is also

adopted in ref. [23].

7

to evaluate the functional rotation (9) directly, we consider

1 h2si  2 h1si ,

(11)

where 1 and 2 are arbitrary variations of the vector supereld v , being indepen-

dent of v itself. we start with the second line of eq. (3). introducing the nota-
tion   ev ev , it is easy to see that 12 = 12 + (symmetric on 1  2)

and 2 =(cid:2)2, (cid:3). therefore we have

in deriving the last expression, we have used the identities (a.3) and (a.4). it is

obvious from the last expression that eq. (12) is a local quantity (like the anomaly

itself) because it does not involve the propagator. thanks to the gauge covariance,

the evaluation of the last expression in the plane wave basis is quite simple as can

be reproduced in a few pages (appendix b). we nally obtain

(13)

in spite of the asymmetric appearances of 1 and 2, this is actually odd under the

exchange 1  2 (one has to note the reality constraint (a.2)). from this, we have

which can be veried to satisfy eq. (10) in conjunction with eq. (8). this provides

the consistency check of eq. (13). similarly, from eqs. (7), (8) and (13), we nally

obtain the consistent gauge anomaly

in this expression, the quantities with the sux g, d

 
g , are dened
by substituting the vector supereld v involved with gv . on the other hand, the

 and w

g , w g

gauge variation v is given by eq. (5) as it stands without setting v  gv . it
is obvious that our consistent anomaly is proportional to the anomaly dabc, as we

expected.

as the simple but non-trivial check of eq. (15), we can consider the abelian

gauge group for which the expression is considerably simplied. by noting v =

i  i in this case, it is easy to see that  [v ] = (1 + 2/3)r d6z tr iw w/

(642) + h.c. this is one-third the covariant abelian anomaly (8) and reproduces

the correct result of the consistent abelian anomaly. we note that nothing special

(except the simplicity of the expression) happens in our treatment of the abelian

9

case.

in approaches based on the consistency condition, strictly speaking, it is

needed to start with the non-abelian case and then take the abelian limit, because

the consistency condition becomes trivial in the abelian case.

one might ask the anomaly (15) actually satisfy the wess-zumino consis-

tency condition. in fact, eq. (15) coincides with the consistent anomaly due to

marinkovic [24] up to the overall normalization (ours is four times smaller). see
0 d egv gv egv is denoted
as sg. since the consistent anomaly in ref. [24] was constructed as the solution

eq. (5) of ref. [24], where g is written as t and r 1

of the consistency condition, we already know that eq. (15) actually satises the

consistency condition.

the form of the anomaly (15) in the wess-zumino gauge [25] is also of some

interest. by setting (z) = a(x + i) for reproducing the usual gauge trans-

formation (a is real) and after the rescaling v  2iv,   i,   i, we

have [24]

 [v ]

m =

vnvpvq(cid:17) +

m(m  m)(cid:21).

(16)

this expression in the wess-zumino gauge is surprisingly simple compared to the

result of the existing eld theoretical calculations, illustrating the advantage of

our treatment. the last term is a gauge variation of a (non-supersymmetric) local

term [24] and the rst term is the celebrated bardeens minimal form [1] with the

correct coecient for a single chiral fermion. we emphasize again that we obtained

eqs. (15) and (16) without supplementing any counterterms.

in this letter, we have presented a (yet another) eld theoretical calculation of

the consistent gauge anomaly in the supereld formalism. as we have shown, it

is possible to fully utilize the advantage of the gauge covariance, by dening the

eective action through the covariant gauge current (eqs. (2) and (3)). although

our result (15) itself has been known in the literature [24] (see also ref. [23]), this is

10

the rst time to our knowledge that an explicit eld theoretical calculation directly

led to the minimal consistent anomaly.

in writing this equation, we have omitted the terms in which  or   explicitly

either because the powers

of m is not sucient for surviving in the m   limit or because the number

of spinor derivatives is not sucient to eliminate the delta function: in the equal
