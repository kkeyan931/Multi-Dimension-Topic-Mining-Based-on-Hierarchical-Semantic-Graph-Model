abstract

we generalize the proof of the non-renormalization of the four derivative operators in
n = 4 yang mills theory with gauge group su (2) to show that certain terms with 2n
derivatives are not renormalized in the theory with gauge group su (n ). these terms may
be determined exactly by a simple perturbative computation. similar results hold for nite
n = 2 theories. we comment on the implications of these results.

introduction

n = 4 yang-mills theory is a remarkable theory in a number of ways. it is a nite and scale

invariant. it is believed to exhibit an exact electric-magnetic duality. it also plays a crucial role

in the matrix model and in the ads/cft duality.

there is evidence that the quantum properties of this theory are even more remarkable

than just niteness.

it has been shown, for example, that not only are the terms with two

derivatives not renormalized, but the four derivative terms are not renormalized as well[1].

the rst suggestion of such a possibility was provided by the agreement of graviton-graviton

scattering with the matrix model[2]. subsequently, it has been observed that three graviton[3]

and even n -graviton scattering[4] at tree level in supergravity agree with the predictions of the

matrix model. while some of these analyses are specic to the case of the matrix model in 0 + 1

dimensions (corresponding to non-compact eleven-dimensional space), some of these hold in

higher dimensions, including 3 + 1[4]. this suggests that there should be non-renormalization

theorems for 2n derivative terms in yang-mills theory with gauge group su (n ) in various

dimensions up to four. in 0 + 1 dimensions, such theorems have been proven for terms with

four[5] and six derivatives[6].

in four dimensions, only the four derivative terms have been

shown to be unrenormalized.

in the present note, we generalize the arguments of [1] to show that certain 2n derivative

terms are not renormalized in 4-dimensional n = 4 su (n ) yang mills theory. the strategy is

similar to that used to calculate multigraviton scattering amplitudes in the matrix model in [4].
the theory has a large moduli space; at generic points, the gauge symmetry is u (1)n 1. one

can, however, consider regions of the moduli space in which there is a hierarchy of breakings;

su (n ) is broken to su (n  1)  u (1), then to su (n  2)  u (1)  u (1), and so on. at

each stage of this breaking, one can integrate out the most massive elds and obtain a suitable

eective lagrangian. by focusing judiciously on certain terms in these eective lagrangians, one

can make arguments similar in spirit to those of [1].

in the rest of the paper, we present the proof. in the next section, we review the analysis

of [4] with particular emphasis on the case of 3 + 1 dimensions (corresponding to compactifying

three of the m -theory dimensions). in section three, we generalize the argument of [1] for non-
renormalization of f 4

 and other four derivative terms in su (2) to a statement about certain
such operators in su (n ) (while we suspect, as argued in [7], the statement holds in general, we

will not attempt to prove it). in section 4, we show that certain six derivative terms in su (3)

2

are not renormalized. the strategy is to rst look at an eective su (2) symmetric theory,

and represent the eect of integrating out the heavy elds through a suitable spurion. the

symmetries  scale invariance and u (1)r invariance, and an approximate shift symmetry for

the background dilaton multiplet  are sucient to completely determine certain six derivative

terms in the theory. this argument can be generalized to su (n ); this is presented in section

4. in section 5, we note that identical arguments and results hold for the nite n = 2 theories.

section 6 contains some speculations.

2 graviton scattering in 8 dimensions and its implications for

n = 4 yang mills theory

the principle reason to suspect that there exists a large hierarchy of non-renormalization theo-

rems comes from studies of multigraviton scattering in the matrix model. the agreement found

in three graviton scattering in 11-dimensional minkowski space [3] is impressive, and suggests

that there should be non-renormalization theorems for some set of six derivative terms in the

matrix quantum mechanics. in [4], it was shown that there is actually agreement for certain

terms in n -graviton scattering, for arbitrary n . moreover, this agreement persists when the

theory is compactied on tori of 1,2 or 3 dimensions. as a result, one expects an innite set

of non-renormalization theorems in these theories. the strategy of the proof will be closely

related to the approach of these earlier computations, so it is perhaps useful to review them

here. we will consider specically the case of compactication of 3 dimensions on a small torus,

corresponding to n = 4 yang-mills theory on a large torus[8, 9].

to study n -graviton scattering (in the discrete light cone (dlcq) formulation of the

theory) in the theory compactied to 8 dimensions, one considers the n = 4 yang-mills theory

with gauge group su (n ). this theory has a moduli space; at generic points the symmetry
su (n ) is broken to u (1)n 1, with the moduli of this breaking being identied with the coor-

dinates of n gravitons. if we write the n = 4 theory in terms of six real (matrix-valued) scalar
elds, i, then

it will be notationally convenient to extend the group to u (n ) so that the vis are unconstrained.

the approach of [4] was to consider a hierarchy of expectation values, vn  vn 1

. . . v2  v1. one can then think of a sequence of breakings, rst to su (n  1)  u (1), then
to su (n  2)  u (1)  u (1), and so on. to illustrate the procedure, consider rst the case of

su (3). in this case, the large expectation value of 1 breaks the symmetry rst to su (2)u (1)
(u (1), for u (3)). we can consider the eective lagrangian for the su (2) theory, obtained by

integrating out the massive states associated with the rst stage of breaking. at one loop, one

can read o the result by a simple trick, generalizing the su (2) result (e.g.

[10]). this gives

(f12 = f11  f22, etc., i.e. they are the dierences of the diagonal matrix elements)

now expand the denominators in small uctuations about the expectation value,

i.e.

replace i in the denominators by v3i3 + i, and expand to second order in i.
identify

where m 2 = 2g2|v12|2. integrating over k yields six-derivative terms in the low energy eective
theory which agree precisely with tree level calculations in supergravity (similar statements

hold in 11, 10 and 9 dimensions). as a result, we expect that, in su (n ), non-renormalization

theorems hold for certain terms with 2n derivatives. in the following, we will show that this is

the case, in regions of the moduli space where the expectation values are hierarchically ordered,

for operators of the form

3 the non-renormalization theorem for the four derivative

terms: extension to su (n )

let us review, rst, the proof of the theorem for the group su (2). presumably, it would be easy

to prove the theorem if one had a convenient superspace formulation for theories with sixteen

supersymmetries. lacking this, it was noted in [1] that one can exploit an n = 2 subgroup

of the full supersymmetry, for which a full o-shell superspace formulation is available. it is

useful to rst describe the theory in an n = 1 language. the theory consists of three chiral

multiplets, i, and a gauge multiplet, w, all in the adjoint representation of the group. an
su (3)  u (1)r subgroup of the full su (4) r-symmetry is manifest in this description. the

is transform as a triplet, each with charge +2/3 under the u (1)r.

in an n = 2 description, the theory consists of a vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet.

the vector multiplet consists of the n = 1 vector multiplet and one of the chiral elds, say 1.
one can write

 =  + w + 2g

(7)

(we have dropped the subscript 1 on ). the kinetic term for the s is (explicitly indicating

the adjoint su (2) index)

lvec = z d2z d2 aa.

(8)

our focus in the following will be on the vector multiplets. we will study at directions

corresponding to expectation values of the scalar components of these multiplets (only). note

that when these elds get expectation values, the u (1)r symmetry which we described above

is broken, but another u (1), which we will call x, survives, which is a linear combination of

the original u (1) and an su (3) generator. the hypermultiplets have charge +4/3 under this

symmetry.

the fact that the kinetic term is an integral over half of superspace allows one to prove

many remarkable properties of the theory. perhaps somewhat more remarkable is that in the

n = 4 case, one can prove statements that involve integrals over the full n = 2 superspace.

consider the at direction in which su (2) is broken to u (1) by the scalar eld in the vector

multiplet. call the light vector multiplet in this direction

  aa

5

(9)

we can ask what sorts of terms one can write involving an integral over the full superspace,

which respect the symmetries of the theory. such an integral has the form[11]:

l4 = z d8h(, ).

(10)

the theory is conformally invariant and so h must be dimensionless. it must respect the u (1)r
symmetry, under which  transforms by a phase. these conditions restrict h to the form[11, 1]:

h =

1
162 ln() ln().

(11)

no scale is necessary in the logarithm, since the dependence on the scale would vanish after

integration over s.

in other words, this expression is scale invariant. related to this, the

integral of h vanishes under an r transformation, since the integral over a chiral supereld

over the full superspace is zero.

if one now includes a background dilaton eld in a vector

multiplet, it is easy to see that this cannot appear in h without spoiling both the scale and r

symmetries. as a result, the one loop expression for the four derivative terms in the eective

lagrangian is exact.

this eective lagrangian includes terms with four powers of f , as well as terms with

derivatives of scalars and fermions. if one compares with component eld computations, one

nds complete agreement up to terms which vanish if one uses the lowest order equations of

motion[12]. it is also not hard to guess a generalization to su (n ). there are now n 1 massless

elds; one can write them as dierences of diagonal entries of an n  n matrix, ij = i  j.

then a guess for a generalization of the su (2) result, which is symmetric under permutations

as well as scale invariance and r symmetries, is[7, 13]:

h =

1

162 xi<j

ln(ij) ln(

ij).

(12)

this expression respects all of the symmetries. it agrees with an explicit one loop computation.

if this term were unique, one could again immediately prove a non-renormalization theorem.

however, the symmetries we have used up to now do not suce to uniquely determine h.

ratios of dierent ijs are both scale invariant and u (1)r invariant. in other words, functions

such as

f (,  )

ij
kl


mn

op

(13)

for various choices of i, j . . . are invariant under the u (1)r invariance and scale invariance for

any choice of f . it is possible that one can still constrain the function completely using the full

6

su (4) r-symmetry, which is not manifest in the n = 2 setup. we will not attempt this here.

instead, we will content ourselves with a more limited statement about four derivative terms

in these theories.

consider, rst, the case of su (3). suppose that one eigenvalue of , say 3 is much larger
than the others; more precisely, 13  23  12. in this limit, we can integrate out the elds
with mass of order 13 to obtain an su (2)-symmetric (wilsonian) eective action. this action,
again, can be written as an integral of a function over the whole superspace. it must be scale

invariant and r-invariant.

in general, again, it can involve ratios of the ijs. but certain

operators cannot be generated by such ratios. in particular, consider those terms which involve
four factors of f [8]
 . f [8] couples only to heavy elds. on dimensional grounds, these terms are
suppressed by at least four factors of the expectation value v13 or v23. restricting our attention
to terms with precisely four such factors limits the possible dimensionless ratios which can be
relevant. in general, h could involve 12
13

, for example. but 12 would contribute either a factor
of f12, which is not relevant here, or a factor of v12, which would imply a suppression by a
power of v13. similarly, 13
23

is irrelevant. as a result, h must take the form

= 1 + 12
23

h =

1
162 (ln(13) ln(

13) + ln(23) ln(

23)).

(14)

again, introducing a background dilaton in the theory, one sees that this coupling is not renor-

malized.

in this way, we have established that in su (3), the terms in the eective action proportional

to

[(f 

13 )4 + . . .]
|v13|4

+

[(f 

23 )4 + . . .]
|v23|4

(15)

are not renormalized. this result clearly generalizes to the case where su (n ) is broken to

su (n  1), to terms involving

[(f 

n i )4 + . . .]
|vn i|4

.

n 1

xi=1

(16)

as always, we are assuming the existence of a suitable wilsonian eective action.

in support of this argument, one can consider the two loop corrections to the four derivative

terms. if one examines the various two loop diagrams, it is easy to see that, in su (n ), in all of
the diagrams, the term proportional to (f [n 1])4
cancellation in the case of su (2) (guaranteed by the theorem of [1]) insures the cancellation to

is proportional to n (n + 1). as a result, the

(vn )4

this order in su (n ).

7

4 six derivative terms in su(3)

first focus on the case of su (3).
in the at direction,  is a diagonal matrix. as in our
discussion of the previous section, we can take it to be principally in the t 8 direction, with a
small component in the t 3 direction, i.e. we can write (for simplicity, writing as a u (3) matrix)

(17)

v3 and [3] are complex.

to study whether the six-derivative operator implied by equation 6 is renormalized, we

might try to use the n = 2 setup of the previous section in the full theory. six derivative

terms would then correspond to integrals over the full superspace of terms with four covariant

derivatives. the particular operator would be generated by terms such as

z d8f (,  )(d12)(d12)( d 

31)( d 

31)

1

|31|4|12|2 .

(18)

this term, one can check, is consistent with all of the symmetries. however, it is not easy to

show that this is not renormalized, as for the four derivative terms, since the integral is scale
and r-invariant for any choice of the function f (,  ) (in particular, it is invariant for functions
f (   ), corresponding to possible perturbative corrections).

instead, we resort to a dierent strategy, which closely parallels the calculation of section

2. we note that for small 3, the low energy theory is approximately an su (2)  u (1) n = 4
supersymmetry gauge theory. this theory, for constant background [8] and f [8]
 possesses not
only unbroken supersymmetry but unbroken r symmetry. for slowly varying f [8]
 and [8],
supersymmetry is broken, as is the u (1)r symmetry. this breaking is described by operators

which couple these elds to the su (2) degrees of freedom. the leading such operator is obtained

from

h =

1

162

2

xi=1

ln(3i) ln(

3i).

(19)

as before, one expands for small 1, 2, and obtains the same su (2) expression as we did
earlier:

lef f =

9
82

[(f [8]

 )4 + . . .]

|v3|4

(

|a|2
|v3|2 +

(v

(20)

the braces now denote

[(f  )4 + . . .] = (f )4 

1
4

(f 2

 )2 + 

(21)

and  is a complex eld,  = 1 + i2.

this lagrangian can be viewed as a perturbation of the low energy, su (2) theory. for
non-vanishing background f [8] and [8] it breaks the supersymmetries. the last two terms in

eqn. 20 also violate the u (1) r-symmetry, and we will focus on these. the rst point to note

about these terms is that they are not renormalized. this is established by our earlier proof of
the non-renormalization of the four derivative terms 1.

treating lef f of eqn. 20 as a perturbation, we want to consider at directions of the low
energy su (2) theory, and construct the eective lagrangian in these at directions to rst order
in the perturbation. we can do this in a manner similar to the treatment of the f 4

 terms if we
treat the supersymmetry breaking terms as a spurion, as follows. describe the gauge coupling
by a chiral eld,  (chiral with respect to both  and ). take the highest component of  to
be proportional to f 4

 , i.e.

with

g2 + . . . 2 2m2,

m2 =

82

[(f [8]

 )4 + . . .]
|v3|4(v3)2

.

(23)

(24)

then the r-symmetry violating aa correction to the eective action arises from the coupling

of  :

lef f = z d2d2 aa.

(25)

1one might object that in our earlier non-renormalization argument, it was crucial that we considered op-
erators which are suppressed only by v4
3. in general,
this would be a valid objection, but the terms which interest us here violate the u (1)r-symmetry of the low
energy su (2) theory, and a more careful examination of possible contributions to h indicates that other possible
corrections of this r-symmetry breaking type are suppressed by further powers of v3. in particular, these could
arise from contributions to h of the form

3, yet here we are dealing with operators suppressed by v6

however, such terms do not respect the u (1)r symmetry of the full theory. the integral over 12 12

2

(22)

vanishes.

note that there are possible corrections to the terms involving aa, coming from operators such as 12
3

and our arguments are not powerful enough to determine if these are or are not renormalized.

in order to determine the terms in the eective action linear in m2 which violate the

r-symmetry, we just need to analyze the possible  -dependence of the eective action. the

 -independent terms are just those of the usual su (2)-theory. by the same arguments as in

[1], there are no possible  -dependent terms one can add to the lagrangian (without covariant

derivatives, i.e.

involving less than six derivatives), except for one which vanishes in the case

of constant (lowest component)  . this term is:

z d8 ln()  + c.c.

(26)

the term is scale invariant. it is invariant under the r symmetry because under the symmetry
ln  shifts by a constant, and the remaining integral gives zero since   is antichiral. it is the

unique term involving an integral over the full superspace with a non-trivial  -dependence.
however, it has the wrong g2-dependence to correspond to feynman diagrams  it has too few
powers of g2. so it is not generated in the theory.

so, in fact, it would seem that there are no terms in the eective theory linear in the

symmetry breaking. this is a non-renormalization theorem, but it seems too strong. how are

we to account for the explicit loop corrections in [4]? here, one must be careful about the use of
the equations of motion. in the absence of the symmetry-breaking term, 2 = 0. as pointed

out by [12], the n = 2 action diers from that computed by the (component) background eld

method by terms which vanish by the tree level equations of motion. including the quantum

corrections, these terms are sixth order in derivatives.
in the presence of the perturbation,
however, 2 = 2m2. in this case, there are additional terms in the eective action. these

can be worked out using formulas which are conveniently collected in [14]. these authors work

out the lagrangian of eqn. 11 in components. examining their results (eqns. b.1-b.9 of that

paper), there is one term bilinear in the s:

using the equations of motion and the actual form of h this yields:

1
2

h, 22,

1
22 m2m2.

this is to be compared to the computation of [4], where one studied

m2hi + c.c. =

1
82

m2
|v12|2  + c.c.

(27)

(28)

(29)

which, by the equations of motion, is equal to the expression, eqn. 28 above, after an integration

by parts.

10

this argument establishes that there are no further renormalizations of any r-symmetry

violating terms in su (3), with six derivatives. the two loop terms in [4] are generated by a

combination of the four derivative terms from integrating out the most massive elds, plus the

four derivative su (2) terms. neither of these are renormalized.

5 generalization to su (n )

in the case of su (n ), we can repeat these arguments. first, just as for the f 4
show that certain f 6

 terms, we can
 terms are not renormalized. in particular, consider rst breaking su (n )
to su (n  1) by an expectation value, vn . we have seen that the four derivative terms in
the one loop eective action involving (f [n 1])4
generalization of the eective action of eqn. 20, where the sum now runs over the generators of

are not renormalized. this yields the obvious

(30)

we can again describe the r-symmetry violating part of this perturbation by treating the
highest component of  , m2, as a spurion:

m2 =

n 2

(n  1)2

[(f [n 1]

|vn |4(vn )2

(31)

we have already established that this term is not renormalized. now we can consider the

su (n  1) theory, with this interaction as a perturbation. we consider the breaking of this

symmetry to su (n  2). the four derivative terms are described by

h =

1

162

n 2

xi=1

ln(n 1,i) ln(

n 1,i).

(32)

again, there are no  -dependent corrections. since the perturbation can be described in terms

of a background  , we see, again, that up to terms related to the equations of motion, there are

no  -dependent corrections to the four derivative terms in the low energy theory, corresponding

to the absence of corrections to six derivative symmetry violating terms in the full theory.

now consider the ( -independent) terms. we want to consider these as perturbations in

the lower energy su (n 2) theory. rewriting this expression in terms of the cartan generators,

we obtain:

(ii + c.c. + . . .)

(33)

here we have kept only terms which are relevant to our analysis, i.e.
those for which the
equations of motion will yield factors of m2. again, this can be generalized to an expression

invariant under su (n 2). using the equations of motion, it reduces to the expression obtained

in the (component) background eld method.

further operators can now be obtained by iteration. finally, we are left with the operator:

(34)

in sum, we see that a set of non-zero terms with a particular symmetry structure are obtained

by symmetry arguments (up to one overall coecient). they are generated at precisely the

expected order in the coupling, with precisely the values obtained from explicit component

eld computations. because they are generated from structures which are not renormalized,

these operators are themselves not renormalized. so we have exhibited what we promised: a

set of operators with up to 2n derivatives which are not renormalized.

6 finite n = 2 theories

in [1], it was noted that not only are the f 4

 terms note renormalized in n = 4 theories, but
identical arguments imply that they are not renormalized in n = 2 theories. the same applies

to the 2n derivative terms we have considered here; the scale invariance and r symmetries

which were necessary in the n = 4 case also hold in these theories. all of the arguments we

have given above go through word for word. the extra matter multiplets in these theories play

a similar role to that of the hypermultiplets in n = 4 theories. like those elds, they carry

charge +4/3 under the u (1)r symmetry.

this represents, then, another large class of theories for which the coecients of terms

with arbitrarily large numbers of derivatives can be calculated exactly.

7 conclusions

we have established that in n = 4 yang-mills theories, there is a large set of non-renormalization

theorems. this property, already guessed from the behavior of the matrix model, is quite re-

markable, and one might wonder both about extensions and possible applications. given the

12

complete agreement of the three graviton scattering amplitude in the case of the matrix model,

we might expect complete agreement in the eld theory for amplitudes which scale correctly

with separation. note also that our techniques do not permit study of terms with more than

2n derivatives, which can be generated by operators with covariant derivatives.

another question is: while non-renormalization theorems plus dualities account for the

agreement of the matrix model and supergravity[15, 16, 17], in what sense do the agreement of

each of the coecients of the 2n derivative terms between the matrix model and supergravity

constitute independent tests of the dualities? given that the results follow from the structure

of iterations of the one loop action, one suspects that the answer is that they do not.

these observations should also have implications for the understanding of the ads/cft

correspondence. it should be possible to generalize the analyses of [18, 19] for scattering of

two d3-branes to n d3-branes in an ads background. this is currently under investigation.

finally, one can ask what sorts of non-perturbative information can be extracted from the

theory using these results, and whether they are applicable to other non-trivial eld theories.

what other interesting facts may be gleaned about these theories, as well as more complete

answers to the questions raised above, are all subjects worthy of further study.
