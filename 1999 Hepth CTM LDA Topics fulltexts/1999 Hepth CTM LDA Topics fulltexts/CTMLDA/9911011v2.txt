abstract

in this paper we study several issues related to the generation of superpotential

induced by background ramond-ramond uxes in compactication of type iia string

theory on calabi-yau four-folds.

identifying bps solitons with d-branes wrapped over

calibrated submanifolds in a calabi-yau space, we propose a general formula for the su-

perpotential and justify it comparing the supersymmetry conditions in d = 2 and d = 10

supergravity theories. we also suggest a geometric interpretation to the supersymmet-

ric index in the two-dimensional eective theory in terms of topological invariants of the

calabi-yau four-fold, and estimate the asymptotic growth of these invariants from btz

black hole entropy. finally, we explicitly construct new supersymmetric vacua for type

iia string theory compactication on a calabi-yau four-fold with ramond-ramond uxes.

1. introduction and summary

the theory of calibrations was developed by harvey and lawson [1] for the purpose

of obtaining geometries with the property that all varieties in the geometry are volume

minimizing. due to this fundamental property, calibrations have proven to be a very useful

tool for investigating supersymmetric congurations of d-branes in string theory. a partial

list of references includes [2-9]. although a signicant progress has been made in the study

of the local dierential geometry of the moduli space of calibrated submanifolds [10,11], its

global structure remains elusive. motivated by [12,13], we hope that physical applications

of calibrated geometry can help to address this problem.

in this paper we study compactication of type iia string theory on a calabi-yau

four-fold with background ramond-ramond uxes. in particular, we are interested in the
vacuum and soliton structure of the resulting n = (2, 2) theory in two dimensions. we
show that supersymmetric vacua can be described by the eective superpotential generated

by ramond-ramond elds, while the bps solitons connecting these vacua correspond to

d-branes wrapped over supersymmetric cycles in the calabi-yau space x. using the

relation between supersymmetric cycles and calibrations we derive the general formula for

the superpotential in the eective eld theory:

w =xzx

(calibrations)  (ramond  ramond elds)

there are two basic types of calibrations on a calabi-yau four-fold x given by the covari-
antly constant forms re() and 1
p!kp, where  denotes the nowhere-vanishing holomorphic
(4, 0)-form and k is the kahler form on x. the rst type of calibrations corresponds to
special lagrangian submanifolds in x and leads to a chiral superpotential, while the lat-

ter is associated with holomorphic cycles of complex dimension p and generates a twisted

chiral superpotential.

given the induced superpotential w one can dene a supersymmetric index i[s](x)
that counts the number of supersymmetric cycles with the homology class [s]  h(x).
namely, i[s](x) is equal to the euler number of the moduli space of calibrated submani-
folds s with at line bundles:

i[s](x) = (cid:16)m[s](x)(cid:17)

we argue that i[s](x) is a topological invariant of the calabi-yau four-fold x. the
dimension of x is very important here, so we do not expect i[s](x) to generalize directly

1

to higher (or lower) dimensional calabi-yau manifolds (however, see [14] and [15] where

analogous invariants of calabi-yau three-folds have been discussed). in some special cases,
i[s](x) can be shown to agree with classical topological invariants of x. for example, when
[s] is the class of a special lagrangian torus, from the conjecture of strominger, yau and
zaslow [12] it follows that i[s](x) = (x).

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section we describe the relevant aspects
of n = (2, 2) theories constructed from calabi-yau four-folds and derive the eective su-
perpotential generated by ramond-ramond uxes. in section 3 we identify bps solitons

in the eective theory with d-branes wrapped over calibrated submanifolds in calabi-yau

spaces. we also discuss possible generalizations and conjecture the form of the superpo-

tential generated by background elds in compactication on manifolds with exceptional

holonomy groups, g2 and spin(7). superpotentials induced by membrane instantons in

g2-manifolds have been discussed in [16] and [17]. section 4 is devoted to the geometrical
interpretation of the supersymmetric index i[s](x). in the case when s is a holomorphic
curve, we estimate the asymptotic growth of i[s](x) from the counting of btz black hole
microstates. in section 5 we explicitly construct new supersymmetric vacua for type iia

string theory compactication on calabi-yau four-folds with ramond-ramond uxes. a

work along these lines has been presented recently in [18]. finally, in the appendix we jus-

tify the formula for the induced superpotential comparing the supersymmetry conditions

in d = 2 and d = 10 supergravity theories.

throughout the paper we assume that x is a smooth compact calabi-yau four-fold,

so that all the vacua in the eective two-dimensional theory are connected by solitons.

most of the results presented here can be generalized to a non-compact x, though not all

the vacua are connected by solitons in such models [19].

2. superpotentials from calabi-yau four-folds

compactication of type iia string theory on a calabi-yau four-fold x leads to n =
(2, 2) theory in two dimensions. the low-energy spectrum of this theory includes h3,1 chiral
superelds i and h1,1 twisted chiral superelds j. here we use the standard notation
hp,q for the dimension of the hodge group h p,q
(x). we denote by i and j the scalar



components of the superelds i and j which correspond, respectively, to deformations

of the complex and the kahler structure of x. note, that the mirror symmetry maps type

2

iia string theory on a four-fold x also to type iia string theory on the mirror variety ex,

such that:

hp,q(x) = h4p,q(ex)

(2.1)

in the two-

and conformal eld theories associated with x and ex are equivalent.

dimensional eective theory this operation corresponds to the twist that exchanges the

multiplets i and j.

let us assume for a moment that there are no background uxes. then the two-
dimensional eective theory is described by n = (2, 2) dilaton supergravity interacting
with a non-linear sigma-model. the complete superspace formulation of this theory will

be presented elsewhere [20]. the target space of this sigma-model is parametrized by the
chiral elds {i} and the twisted chiral elds {j}, so that the target space metric is kahler
and torsionless. from the kaluza-klein reduction of type iia theory on x one can easily

nd that in the large volume limit the target space metric is equal to the metric on the
moduli space of x, mc(x) mk(x). for example, the eective kahler potential for the
chiral superelds:

kc(i, i) =  log(cid:16)zx

  (cid:17),

(2.2)

where  denotes the covariantly constant (4, 0)-form, is equal to the kahler potential of
the weil-petersson metric on mc(x). therefore, at least classically, we may identify the
space of vacua with the moduli space of the calabi-yau manifold x. however, as we

explain below, most of these vacua are lifted once we turn on ramond-ramond uxes.

one of the most important features of low-dimensional string theory compactications

is the global anomaly [21,22] given by the euler number, (x), of the calabi-yau four-

fold x. in general, to cancel the anomaly one has to introduce a background ux for the

four-form eld g and/or n fundamental strings lling two-dimensional space-time, such

that the following condition is satised:

n =


24 

1

2(2)2 zx

g  g

(2.3)

in particular, g must be non-zero when (x)/24 is not integer. besides g-uxes one can

also turn on background values of the other ramond-ramond elds: a 2-form f and a zero-

form m dual to the ten-form associated with d8-branes. note, non-zero value of m leads

to the ten-dimensional theory with a cosmological constant [23], the so-called massive type

iia supergravity [24]. furthermore, one can consider compactications where background

3

elds f and g have two indices in the noncompact directions. in what follows it will be
convenient, instead, to introduce the dual eight-form f (8) and the six-form g(6) which

have only internal space-time indices. all these ramond-ramond eld strengths can be

combined into a formal sum:

f = m + if + g + i g(6) + f (8),

so that f  h (x). we denote by vk (resp. k) two-dimensional superelds (resp. their
scalar components) representing dierent choices of the ux f .

in general, non-zero ramond-ramond uxes break supersymmetry generating an ef-
fective superpotential w (i, j, vk) in the two-dimensional theory [19,25]. usually it is
very dicult to see the superelds vk explicitly, so we mainly consider the chiral superpo-
tential w (i) and the twisted chiral superpotential fw (j) obtained via integration over
the elds vk. a simple way to nd eective superpotential is to interpret bps solitons in
n = (2, 2) theory as d-branes wrapped over supersymmetric cycles in x.

let us start with a simple example which is actually a precursor of calibrated geometry.

consider compactication of type iia theory on x with a non-zero ux of the 4-form eld

strength g. the eective superpotential looks like [19]:

w (i) =

1

2 zx

  g

(2.4)

to see how the formula (2.4) comes about, let us take a d4-brane wrapped over a su-
persymmetric four-cycle s  h4(x, zz). in the two-dimensional eective eld theory this
state is a bps soliton interpolating between two supersymmetric vacua. since g jumps

across the d4-brane, these vacua correspond to the dierent four-form uxes g1 and g2,
such that g/2 = (g1  g2)/2 is poincare dual to the homology class [s]. in order
to nd the superpotential we note that in the eective n = (2, 2) theory the mass of the
bps soliton connecting the two vacua is given by the absolute value of w . on the other

hand, the mass of this soliton is given by the mass of the d4-brane wrapped over the

special lagrangian cycle s. therefore we nd w =rs  = 1
with the calabi-yau space x, w =rs  has the mirror non-chiral counterpart [26]:

in type iia compactication on a calabi-yau four-fold x.

there are several terms in (2.6) which also can be deduced from the relation between

solitons and d-branes. consider a soliton constructed from a d8-brane wrapped over the

entire x. since the value of m changes by 2 in crossing the d8-brane, the soliton connects

two vacua with dierent values of the eld m . in the theory with four supercharges the
mass of this soliton vol(x) = 1

4!rx k  k  k  k is expected to be proportional to
the change in the superpotential fw . this is indeed the case, in accordance with the

formula (2.6) predicted by the mirror symmetry. in order to obtain another term in (2.6)

proportional to the eight-form ux one has to consider a soliton constructed from a d0-

brane. since the latter does not wrap any cycle in the calabi-yau space x, the mass of

this soliton does not depend on the moduli of x, in accordance with fw = 1
the induced superpotential lifts (part of) the classical vacua in the eective two-
dimensional theory. now a point in the moduli space mc(x)  mk(x) corresponds
to a supersymmetric vacuum only if it is a minmum of the eective superpotential. this

picture suggests to interpret the extremality conditions of the induced superpotential as the

supersymmetry conditions in type iia theory on the calabi-yau space x with ramond-

ramond uxes. let us illustrate this interpretation with the following example. since

type iia string theory is related to m-theory via compactication on a circle we expect

type iia supersymmetry conditions in part to be similar to those in eleven-dimensions

[19,27]. for instance, if the 4-form g is the only non-vanishing ramond-ramond eld the

supersymmetry conditions should be exactly the same as in m-theory. when g has only

internal space-time indices, eq. (2.6) leads to a simple expression for the superpotential

proposed in [19]:

(2.7)

fw =

its variation is equivalent to the primitivity condition g  k = 0 which is one of the
supersymmetry conditions found in [27]. the other supersymmetry constraints require
g(3,1) = 0. this is precisely what one nds from the variation of the superpotential (2.4).

5

more generally, we expect the supersymmetry conditions in type iia theory on x

with ramond-ramond uxes to be equivalent to the supersymmetry conditions in the

two-dimensional eective eld theory. a supersymmetric vacuum of the two-dimensional

theory corresponds to a minimum of the superpotential:

dw
di

= 0

and

dfw

di

= 0,

(2.8)

where we use the appropriate covariant derivatives di = d/di and dj = d/dj. the
form of the covariant connection is determined by the requirement that dw transforms
covariantly under a kahler transformation k  k + f + f , where f is an arbitrary
holomorphic function. since the superpotential transforms as w  ef w , we must dene
the holomorphic connection as dw = w + (k)w in order to have dw  ef dw
under the kahler transformation [28]. in plain english, this means that in supergravity

theory with four supercharges a superpotential is a section of a holomorphic line bundle,

rather than a usual function. therefore, the chiral superpotential (2.4) proportional to
the choice of  (which is a section of a line bundle over mc(x)) exhibits exactly the right
behavior.
the values of w andfw in the minimum determine, respectively, the mass m and the
twisted mass em of the gravitino elds [20,29]. the latter, in turn, dene two-dimensional

cosmological constant, so that we have:

 = |w|2  |fw|2

(2.9)

hence, a general supersymmetric vacuum corresponds to ads2 space with a (negative)

cosmological constant given by (2.9). this is precisely what one nds from compactica-

tion of massive type iia supergravity on a calabi-yau four-fold x. in the appendix we

demonstrate that ten-dimensional supersymmetry conditions are equivalent to the equa-

tions (2.8) and (2.9), with the holomorphic functions w and fw given by (2.4) and (2.6).

namely, extremizing (2.4) and (2.6) we nd the following equations2:

g(3,1) = g(1,3) = 0.

(2.10)

2 notice, the holomorphic covariant derivative di w = i w +(i kc(i))w computed using
the kahler potential (2.2) has a nice property that di  is orthogonal to  [30,31]. therefore,

one can equivalently dene di as a covariant connection which satises rx

(di )   = 0.

and

m

f  k  k + g  k + i g(6) = 0

(2.11)

which are precisely the supersymmetry conditions that one nds in compactication of

massive type iia supergravity on the calabi-yau space x with background ramond-

ramond uxes (see appendix for the details).

let us now see what kind of corrections we could expect to the semi-classical ex-

pressions (2.4) and (2.6). because the type iia dilaton comes in the real gravitational

multiplet there are no stringy corrections to the superpotential. furthermore, the chiral

superpotential w (i) is exact at the tree level simply because there are no three-branes

in type iia string theory. on the other hand, the twisted chiral superpotential fw (j)
is modied by world-sheet instantons [25] as well as by ve-brane instantons [32]. since
a ve-brane wrapped over a cycle s  h6(x, zz) implies the cohomology class of the 4-
form eld g restricted to s to be trivial, non-zero 4-ux can prevent ve-brane instanton

corrections. nevertheless, one can use the mirror symmetry to nd the exact form of the

twisted chiral superpotential [25]. the basic idea is that eective two-dimensional theories

constructed by considering type iia theory on the mirror calabi-yau four-folds x and ex

must be equivalent. in particular, we expect:

therefore, the world-sheet instanton eects (on the right-hand side of the formula (2.12))

wx (i) = fwex

(i)

(2.12)

can be found evaluating the period integral (2.4) on the left-hand side of (2.12).

3. solitons and calibrations

in general, we can consider a d(2p)-brane of type iia theory wrapped over a 2p-
cycle s  h2p(x, zz). in the eective two-dimensional eld theory this state looks like a
soliton connecting two vacua corresponding to the dierent set of ramond-ramond uxes

on the eight-manifold x. the dierence between the uxes is given by the poincare dual

cohomology class f = c[s]  h 82p(x, zz).

furthermore, bps solitons correspond to d-branes wrapped over supersymmetric cy-

cles. out of the states with a given set of charges, a soliton that saturates the bogomolnyi

bound has the least mass. in string theory it means that the corresponding d-brane is

wrapped over a cycle which has minimal area in its homology class. this property of

7

bps states constructed from wrapped d-branes has a very nice geometric interpretation

in terms of calibrations [1].

let us remind the denition of calibrated submanifolds, as in harvey and lawson [1].

let  be a closed k-form on x. we say that  is a calibration if it is less than or equal to
the volume on each oriented k-dimensional submanifold s  x. namely, combining the
orientation of s with the restriction of the riemann metric on x to the subspace s, we
can dene a natural volume form vol(txs) on the tangent space txs for each point x  s.
then, |txs =   vol(txs) for some   ir, and we write:

|txs  vol(txs)

if   1. if equality holds for all points x  s, then s is called a calibrated submanifold
with respect to the calibration . according to this denition, the volume of a calibrated

submanifold s can be expressed in terms of  as:

vol(s) =zxs

|txs =zs

 =zx

  c[s]

(3.1)

since the right-hand side depends only on the cohomology class, we can write:

vol(s) =zx

  c[s] =zx

 d[s] =zxs 

|txs  zxs 

vol(txs) = vol(s)

for any other submanifold s in the same homology class. therefore, we have just demon-

strated that calibrated manifolds have minimal area in their homology class, the property

we expect of the wrapped d-branes to represent bps solitons.

from the supersymmetry algebra it follows that the mass of a bps soliton is equal
to the change in superpotential, |w|. since the former is given by the formula (3.1) and
the change of the ramond-ramond uxes f is poincare dual to the homology class [s],
we obtain the following general formula for the superpotential:

w (i, j) =

1

2 zx

  f

(3.2)

calibrations are very useful in the study of manifolds with special holonomy groups.

this is because special holonomy groups are characterized by the existence of covariantly

constant forms. these forms can be used as calibrations. let us now illustrate the formula

(3.2) with some examples of special calibrations.

8

su (4) calibrations : the main goal of this paper is to study type iia compactica-

tions on calabi-yau four-folds. these manifolds have su (4) holonomy group. there are

two types of calibrations on manifolds with su (4) holonomy group (more generally, on

manifolds with su (n) holonomy group). if we take:

 =

1
2k2 + re(ei),

(3.3)

we obtain a u (1) family of the so-called cayley calibrations. substituting the cayley

calibration into (3.2), we reproduce the chiral superpotential (2.4) plus the twisted chiral

superpotential (2.7). this is, of course, not surprising since deriving the formula (2.4) we

implicitly used the special case of the calibration (3.3) corresponding to special lagrangian

submanifolds.

indeed, a special lagrangian manifold is a calibrated submanifold with

respect to the special lagrangian calibration:

 = re()

one can obtain the other type of su (4) calibrations  kahler calibrations  consid-

ering various powers of the complexied kahler form:

 =

1
p!kp

(3.4)

since k is covariantly constant, (3.4) is covariantly constant as well. the submanifolds
calibrated by this  are complex submanifolds s  x of complex dimension p. it is easy
to see that in this case the general formula (3.2) yields the twisted chiral superpotential

(2.6) predicted by mirror symmetry, with the right numerical coecients.

g2 calibrations : in our derivation of the superpotential (3.2) we made very mild
assumptions about the geometry of the manifold x. namely, x had to be a riemannian

manifold, not necessarily eight-dimensional, such that a compactication of type iia

string on x preserved four unbroken supersymmetries. hence, all of the above arguments

also apply verbatim to the seven-dimensional manifolds of g2 holonomy, with the word
a soliton replaced by a domain wall. this change is due to the fact that now we talk
about n = 2 three-dimensional eective eld theory, so that dierent vacua are connected
by domain walls rather than by solitons.

manifolds of g2 holonomy are characterized by a covariantly constant three-form (3)
invariant under the exceptional group g2. from the formula (3.2) we expect to nd the
following superpotential in the eective three-dimensional theory:

w =

(3)  g

(3.5)

1

2 zx

9

a domain wall that connects dierent vacua in this theory corresponds to a d4-brane
wrapped over three-dimensional associative submanifold s calibrated by (3).

the coassociative calibration (4) = (3) is dened as a 4-form hodge dual to
(3). the submanifolds calibrated by (4) are four-dimensional coassociative submani-
folds. since a domain wall in three non-compact dimensions can be constructed from an

ns5-brane wrapped over a coassociative cycle s, from the expression (3.2) we expect the
following superpotential corresponding to the calibration (4):

w =

1

2 zx

(4)  h

(3.6)

here h is the ns-ns three-form eld strength.

spin(7) calibrations : even though our arguments do not directly apply to the case

of eight-manifolds with spin(7) holonomy which break too much supersymmetry, it is
amusing to employ the general formula (3.2) to the cayley calibration (+) of degree four.
the form (+) is self-dual, (+) = (+). we conjecture the following expression for the
superpotential:

w =

1

2 zx

(+)  g

(3.7)

in the present paper we will not pursue the proof of the formulas (3.5) - (3.7) for the

manifolds of the exceptional holonomy.

as one can denitely see, calibrated geometries prove to be very useful in writing

superpotentials induced by background uxes.

4. a mathematical application: counting bps solitons

to explain the geometric meaning of the eective superpotentials found in the previous
sections, we recall that the expectation values of the elds i and j play the role of the
kahler and the complex moduli of a calabi-yau space x, respectively. therefore, in a

background with zero ramond-ramond elds the classical space of supersymmetric vacua

of the two-dimensional eective eld theory is simply the moduli space of x.

when ramond-ramond uxes do not vanish, the degeneracy of supersymmetric
ground states is (partly) lifted by the induced superpotential 3 w (i, j, vk). solving
the equations:

dw
dk

= 0

(4.1)

3 for the purposes of the present section we restore dependence on the moduli k of the
ramond-ramond elds. since in many cases the explicit form of the complete superpotential
w (i, j, vk) is not known, we do not dierentiate between chiral and twisted chiral superelds.

10

for k, one can integrate out the elds vk and obtain the eective chiral superpotential
w (i) and the twisted chiral superpotential fw (j).
if for certain values of i and j
the resulting superpotentials have a minimum, then the two-dimensional eld theory has a

supersymmetric vacuum obtained from the supersymmetric compactication on x with the

kahler and the complex moduli dened by the solution of (2.8). thus, supersymmetric

vacua form a subspace in the moduli space of x, as shown in fig.1. for example, a

compactication with a g-ux is supersymmetric only if the kahler structure of x is such

that g is primitive [27]. this condition is equivalent to (2.8) with the twisted superpotential

(2.7).

fig. 1: classical vacua of the eective two-dimensional eld theory form a subspace
in the moduli space of x. every point of this subspace is associated with the moduli
space of a supersymmetric cycle s, for a given complex and kahler structure of x.

notice that the superpotentials (2.4) and (2.6) constructed in the previous section
depend only on the cohomology class of the ramond-ramond ux f . therefore, when
(4.1) has several solutions, a minimum of the eective superpotential with the elds vk
integrated out corresponds to multiple supersymmetric vacua, all representing the same
cohomology class [f ]. this multiplicity appears, for example, in a computation of the
witten index in the eective two-dimensional theory. for every point (i, j) in the moduli
space of x, let us denote its contribution to the supersymmetric index by i[f](x):

i[f](x) = tr(1)f

11

(4.2)

the right-hand side of this denition is the supersymmetric index in the two-dimensional
eective theory with the dynamical elds k and the calabi-yau moduli (elds {i} and
{j}) being xed. the latter must satisfy the supersymmetry conditions (2.8) in order for
i[f](x) to be non-zero. since we regard i and j as background elds, the supersym-
metric index (which in simple cases counts the number of supersymmetric ground states

in the eective theory) is expected to be stable under deformations of the four-fold x
[33]. therefore, i[f](x) must be a topological invariant of x, at least as long as we do
not cross a surface of marginal stability4 in the moduli space of x. for a given x and
[f ]  h (x, zz), let m[f](x) be the set of solutions to (4.1). then i[f](x) is equal to
the euler number of m[f](x):

i[f](x) = (cid:16)m[f](x)(cid:17)

(4.3)

there is an equivalent geometric denition of i in terms of the homology class [s]
poincare dual to [f ]. with every supersymmetric vacuum representing the ramond-
ramond ux f we can associate a bps soliton constructed from a d-brane 5 wrapped
over the dual supersymmetric cycle s. hence, i can be dened as the number of super-
symmetric cycles with the homology class [s]. more precisely, a system of invariants i for
a calabi-yau four-fold x is a family of maps i: h(x, zz)  zz dened by:

i[s](x) = (cid:16)m[s](x)(cid:17)

where m[s](x) is the moduli space of calibrated submanifolds together with at line
it is important to bear in mind that a d-brane carries a u (1) gauge eld.
bundles.

we do not discuss here the important questions of smoothness and compactness, simply
assuming that there is a compactication of m[s](x) such that (4.4) makes sense. the
motivation for this assumption is based in part on the following two examples where a

suitable compactication can be achieved.

4 the meaning of this term will become clear in a moment when we give a dual denition of

the invariants i(x) in terms of supersymmetric cycles in x.

5 due to the anomaly inow [34], d-branes on curved manifolds carry induced charge of lower
dimensional branes. therefore, the accurate relation between i[f ](x) and the invariant i[s](x)
dened below involves bound states of d-branes. this subtlety, however, is not important for the

denition of i[s](x) unless we are interested in the precise relation to i[f ](x).

12

when [s] is an element of h2(x, zz), the supersymmetric cycles are given by the sub-
manifolds calibrated with respect to the kahler form of x. therefore, in this case the
invariant i[s](x) is equal to the euler number of the moduli space of holomorphic curves
with a at line bundle. unlike the denition of the gromov-witten invariants [35,36],

there are no constraints on s except to stay within a given homology class. therefore one

might worry that there are innitely many contributions from curves of arbitrary topology.

however, by the riemann-roch theorem the virtual (complex) dimension of the moduli
space of genus g curves in a calabi-yau four-fold is equal to (1  g), so that generic point
in m[s](x) corresponds to a rational homology 2-sphere. for such curves dimension of
the space of at u (1) connections is zero. at least for some simple cases, one may hope
to use the close relation to the gromov-witten invariants to compute i[s](x).

although it is dicult to count supersymmetric cycles in general case, we can predict
the asymptotic growth of i[s](x) under rescaling [s]  n [s] by a large number n . to
estimate the number of holomorphic curves in a calabi-yau four-fold x we use the

microscopic interpretation of black hole entropy [37]. the analysis is very similar to the

derivation of the entropy of extreme black holes constructed from calabi-yau three-folds

[38,39]. consider m-theory compactication on a four-fold x down to three dimensions.
then, an m2-brane wrapped around a 2-cycle in the homology class [s]  h2(x, zz)
represents the extreme btz black hole [40] with charge [s]. the entropy of this black hole

is related to the number of bps states with a given charge:

sbt z = logi[s](x)

(4.5)

on the other hand, bekenstein-hawking entropy of the extreme btz black hole is related

to its mass mbt z [41]:

sbt z pmbt z

(4.6)

in m theory the mass mbt z is given by the mass of a membrane wrapped around a cycle
s of minimal area, so that as [s]  n [s] the mass scales as mbt z  n . therefore, from
(4.6) we conclude that to the leading order in n  1 the number of bps states grows as:

i[s](x)  exp(an )

(4.7)

for some constant a. there is one remark in place here. the above argument based on the
black hole entropy formula actually predicts the growth of cohomologies of m[s](x), rather
than its euler number (m[s](x)). the latter should have the same large n behavior

13

i[s](x) = (cid:16)m(vch, ex)(cid:17)

(4.8)

unless there is a nearly perfect cancellation between cohomologies of odd and even degree.

this is indeed the case for calabi-yau three-folds [39].

if such a miracle also happens

for calabi-yau four-folds, then the formula (4.7) should be understood only as an upper

bound. it says that i[s](x) grow not faster than exp(an ).

s is a special lagrangian torus : consider [s]  h4(x, zz), so that i[s](x) counts
special lagrangian submanifolds in the homology class [s] with a choice of at u (1) con-

nection. a similar invariant counting special lagrangian homology 3-spheres in calabi-yau

three-folds was recently introduced by joyce [14]. according to [42,13], the mirror symme-

try can be understood as an equivalence between derived categories over the mirror spaces

x and ex. in particular, it means that the moduli space of special lagrangian manifolds
(with a at connection) in a given homology class [s]  h4(x) is equivalent to the moduli
space, m(vch, ex), of stable vector bundles over the mirror space ex, where the chern class
ch  h (ex) is determined by [s]. therefore, when s is a special lagrangian manifold, eq.

(4.4) can be written as:

now suppose that x admits a special lagrangian 4-torus bration [12,43], and let

us take [s] to be the class of the ber. then, according to the conjecture of strominger,
yau and zaslow [12], there is a compactication of m[s](x) isomorphic to the mirror
calabi-yau manifold:

in this case we have i[s](x) = (ex) = (x). obviously, the latter is a topological

invariant of x, though not a new one.

m[s](x) = ex.

5. new supersymmetric vacua

in the previous sections we found a set of constraints on calabi-yau moduli and
ramond-ramond uxes which preserve n = 2 supersymmetry in two dimensions. there
is a compact way of writing these conditions in terms of the eective superpotentials (2.4)

and (2.6).

from the above discussion it is also clear that these supersymmetry constraints are

highly restrictive, so that usually it is very dicult to nd an explicit solution. for example,

when g is the only non-zero eld one has to look for integral primitive forms of hodge

type (2, 2). this problem was studied in a recent work [18].

14

below we present a family of solutions to the supersymmetry conditions of the follow-

ing form:

m
2

= n0,

if
2

= n2k,

g
2

=

n4
2 k  k

(5.1)

of course, to consort with the ux quantization of the eld f one has to make an appropri-
ate choice of the kahler structure, such that k  h 2(x, zz) and n2 is an integer number.
the quantization condition of the eld g is more subtle [22]:

g
2 

p1(x)

4

 h 2(x, zz)

when (x)/24  zz, the number n4 is integer. in massive type iia string theory m
also has to be an integer.

2 = n0

the solution described above automatically satises the supersymmetry condition

(2.10). therefore, it remains to check the conditions that follow from the twisted chiral

superpotential (2.6):

1

2 zx

m
4! k  k  k  k +

i
3!

f  k  k  k +

1
2!

and

g  k  k = emvol (x)

m
6 k  k  k +

i
2

f  k  k + g  k = 0

(5.2)

(5.3)

substituting the ansatz (5.1) into (5.2) and (5.3) we obtain a system of two algebraic

equations:

n0 + 4n2 + 6n4 = em, n0 + 3n2 + 3n4 = 0

which must be solved in integer numbers. from the second equation we see that there are
no solutions when n4  zz + 1
integer. the solution is given by:

2 . hence, (x) has to be divisible by 24, so that n4 is an

(5.4)

(5.5)

n0 = 6n4  3em

and n2 = em  3n4.

this solution can be easily generalized to include the ramond-ramond six-form and

eight-form uxes on the calabi-yau four-fold. namely, if along with (5.1) we turn on the
elds g(6) and f (8) of the form:

i g(6)
2

=

n6
3! k  k  k,

f (8)
2

=

n8
4! k  k  k  k

15

then instead of (5.5) we obtain:

n0 = 6n4 + 8n6 + 3n8  3em

and n2 = em  3n4  3n6  n8.

appendix i. massive type iia supergravity on eight-manifolds

in this appendix we systematically derive the formulas (2.4) and (2.6) for the eective

superpotential comparing the supersymmetry conditions in d = 2 and d = 10 supergravity
theories. we consider compactication of type iia string theory to ads2x, where x is a
calabi-yau four-fold, and ask for the conditions on the background ramond-ramond elds
to preserve at least n = 2 supersymmetry in two dimensions. we follow the notations of
[19,27] where a similar analysis was carried out for compactications with a g-eld.

in the large volume limit the eective superstring dynamics is described by a su-

pergravity theory, viz. massive type iia supergravity [24], since the 0-form eld m is

generically non-zero. the bosonic eld content of the massive type iia supergravity con-

tains the metric gm n , the dilaton , a vector eld am , tensor elds bm n and cm np and
a mass parameter m . by supersymmetry we also have non-chiral spinor elds: a gravitino

m and a dilatino . the bosonic part of the lagrangian looks like [24]:

where we introduced the gauge-invariant eld strengths [44]:

fm n = 2[m an] + m bm n

hm np = 3[m bnp ]

gm np q = 4[m cnp q] + 24b[m n p aq] + 6m 2b[m n bp q]

note that our notations slightly dier from the notations in [24]. one reason for this
is to simplify the comparison with the ordinary type iia supergravity. in the limit m  0
the last two terms in (i.1) disappear and we end up with the standard eective action for
the massless type iia elds. when m 6= 0, we can gauge away the vector eld am by
gauge transformations of bm n , leaving the latter with a mass but without gauge invariance
in a higgs-type mechanism. the value of the ten-dimensional cosmological constant in the

16

massive phase is also determined by m . we use the metric in the einstein frame which is

related to the string metric by the rescaling:

m n = e 1
gst

2 gm n

(i.2)

the action of the massive type iia supergravity is invariant under 16 left and 16

right supersymmetry transformations, such that the left supersymmetries are chiral while

the right supersymmetries are anti-chiral, with the ten-dimensional chirality operator 11.
below we use the explicit form of the supersymmetry transformations only for the fermionic

elds. for the gravitino we have:

in order to cancel the anomaly (2.3) one has to introduce n = 1

24 (x) fundamen-
tal strings lling two-dimensional non-compact space. we represent these strings by the

following maximally symmetric ansatz for the eld strength hm np :

hm =  mf (xm)

(i.5)

where the function f (xm) depends only on the coordinates on x. a space-lling funda-
mental string is invariant under the supersymmetry transformations (i.3) - (i.4) with the

supersymmetry parameter  satisfying the projection relation:

0111 = 

(i.6)

where we used the standard notation m1...mn = 1
n! [m1 . . . mn] for the antisymmetrized
product of gamma-matrices. with this choice of sign, the relation (i.6) implies that the

supersymmetry is preserved by the spinor  which has positive eight-dimensional chirality.

in other words, if we decompose  as:

 =    +   ,

17

(i.7)

then the eight-dimensional commuting spinor  must satisfy 9 = , where we also make

the 10=2+8 split of the ten-dimensional gamma-matrices:

 =   9, m = 1  m

the opposite choice of sign in the formula (i.6) would correspond to anti-strings which

make a negative contribution to the total charge n . since calabi-yau four-folds usually
admit only one sort of nowhere-vanishing chiral spinors6, the total number of strings, n ,

must be positive. we choose  to be a covariantly constant complex spinor of unit norm.

note, the existence of such a spinor on the calabi-yau four-fold x automatically implies
n = (2, 2) supersymmetry in two dimensions. using the spinor  we dene the complex
n and the kahler form kab = igab. since the metric on x is of
structure jm
type (1,1), it is convenient to think of holomorphic gamma-matrices a and a as creation
and annihilation operators:

n = im

a = 0,

a = 0,

a = 0,

a = 0

(i.8)

the eld h is taken in the form (i.5), while all the fermionic elds are assumed to
vanish in the background. to avoid cluttering, we also assume for a moment that g(6) = 0
and f (8) = 0, i.e. the background elds f and g have all their indices in the internal

directions. in fact, it will be very easy to include these elds in the analysis; the terms with

f and gmn can be treated in a way similar to the terms with m and fmn, respectively.

for example, let us consider the term with gmn in the variation of the dilatino (i.4).

using the standard gamma-matrix algebra and the projection relation (i.6) we get:

gmnmn = g01mnmn11

(i.9)

which has exactly the same form as the term with fmn, cf.

(i.4). one can take into

account the term with f in an analogous way. besides the supersymmetry conditions

and the eld equations, we put no further restrictions on the internal components of the

ramond-ramond elds, gmnpq, fmn and m .

6 calabi-yau four-folds that admit spinors of both chiralities have zero euler number. ac-
cording to the formula (2.3), no new interesting vacua with non-zero g-ux can be found in

compactication on such x.

18

we consider a maximally symmetric compactication on x with the metric:

ds2

10 = 1(cid:16)ds2

2(x) + ds2

8(xm)(cid:17)

(i.10)

where we introduced the warp factor (xm). using the proper rescaling of dirac gamma-

matrices:

m  1/2m , m  1/2m

we rewrite the supersymmetry variations (i.3)-(i.4) of the fermionic elds in the metric

(i.10). for the gravitino we get:

m = m

now we put the variations of the fermion elds to zero and project the corresponding

equations onto subspaces of positive and negative chirality. we use the decomposition (i.7)

of the spinor  and assume that the two-dimensional spinor  satises:

cosmological constant [20,29], in accordance with the formula (2.9). in the formula (i.13)
we introduced 1

factor to agree with the denition of superpotential in section 2 where

in particular, they determine two-dimensional

we implicitly put d-brane tension equal to unity.

19

let us assume that the spinor  has positive chirality. as we will see below, the spinor

 of negative chirality leads to the complex conjugated supersymmetry conditions. from

(i.12) we get the equation:

(i.17)

the rst order equation (i.14) relates the dilaton and the scalar function f which

e = 2/9,

f =

(i.18)

two independent equations (i.15) and (i.17) relate the ramond-ramond eld strengths

contracted with gamma matrices.

the complex spinor  on a calabi-yau four-fold obeys the following relations [2]:

abcd = 3k[ackbd],

abcd = abcd

(i.19)

using (i.19) and (i.15) we can rewrite the condition (i.17) in the string metric in the form

of two independent equations:

note, there is no dependence on the dilaton in the string metric. this is what we ex-

pected from the very beginning since the dilaton comes in the real gravitational multiplet,

20

while the supersymmetry conditions must have interpretation in terms of a (twisted) chiral

superpotential in the two-dimensional eective theory.

substituting the standard relations [45]:

into (i.20) and (i.21) we obtain, respectively, the superpotential (2.4) and the twisted super-
potential (2.6), provided that w =  32
using gamma-matrix algebra one can check that (i.15) is equivalent to the two-dimensional

 mvol(x) and fw = 11

2 emvol(x). furthermore,

supersymmetry condition (2.11). it remains to identify the other supersymmetry condition
(2.10). a short way to see it is to note that ab component of (i.15) gives f (2,0)  g(3,1).
however, for calabi-yau four-folds h 2,0(x) is trivial, so that f -ux of type (2, 0) or (0, 2)

is not allowed for topological reasons. therefore, in a supersymmetric vacuum we must

also have:

g(3,1) = g(1,3) = 0

(i.22)

more explicitly, the supersymmetry constraint (i.22) follows from the variation of the

internal components of the gravitino. since the argument word-for-word follows the one

in [27], we shall not present it here.

in order to represent (i.22) as a variation of the chiral superpotential (2.4), we note
that di  is orthogonal to . this follows from the fact that i  h 4,0(x)  h 3,1(x)
[31]. explicitly, one can write:

i = (3,1)

i

 ki,

where (3,1)  h 3,1(x) and ki depends only on the complex structure moduli i but not on
the coordinates on x. multiplying this equation by  and integrating over the calabi-yau

space x, we nd:

ki = i log(z   ).

this proves that the covariant derivative di w = iw + (ikc(i))w computed using
the kahler potential (2.2) indeed satises the property di   h 3,1(x). hence, variation
of the chiral superpotential (2.4) is equivalent to (i.22). to summarize, the supersymmetry

21

conditions in ten-dimensional supergravity with background ramond-ramond uxes can

be written in the form (2.8), with the superpotential:

w =

1

2 zx

  g

and the twisted chiral superpotential:

fw =

m
4! k  k  k  k +

i
3!

f  k  k  k +

1
2

g  k  k + i g(6)  k + f (8)

where we included the background elds f and gmn with indices in non-compact
directions.

finally, we explain that another set of supersymmetry transformations (i.11) and

(i.12) with a spinor  of negative chirality leads to complex conjugated supersymmetry

conditions. notice that according to (i.6) the ten-dimensional chirality of the spinor  is

directly related to the two-dimensional chirality of the spinor . if in our calculation we used

the spinor  of negative chirality, we would obtain the complex conjugated supersymmetry

conditions. to see this we note that 11 appears in (i.11) and (i.12) only in the terms
that contain fm n or hm np . however, the three-form h always comes contracted with
two-dimensional gamma-matrices, so that we have extra 3 factor due to the specic form
of the ansatz (i.5). therefore, the terms with h do not change the sign if we change the

chirality of  (= chirality of ). this is not the case for the terms proportional to the

internal components of the two-form f (and also for the terms linear in gmn which have
the same gamma-matrix structure (i.9)). we conclude that the supersymmetry conditions

for the spinors of negative chirality dier only by signs of all the terms with fmn and
gmn.
