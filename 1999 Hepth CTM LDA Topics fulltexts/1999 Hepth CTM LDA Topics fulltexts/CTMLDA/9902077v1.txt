abstract

we propose a method to construct quantum theory of matter elds in a
topology changing universe. analytic continuation of the semiclassical gravity
of a lorentzian geometry leads to a non-unitary schrodinger equation in a
euclidean region of spacetime, which does not have a direct interpretation
of quantum theory of the minkowski spacetime.
in this euclidean region
we quantize the euclidean geometry, derive the time-dependent schrodinger
equation and nd the quantum states using the liouville-neumann method.
the wick rotation of these quantum states provides the correct hilbert space
of matter eld in the euclidean region of the lorentzian geometry.
it is
found that the direct quantization of a scalar eld in the lorentzian geometry
involves an unusual commutation rule in the euclidean region.

i. introduction

the open ination model proposed recently by hawking-turok [1] revived an interest in
the wave functions of quantum cosmology, and provoked a debate on the boundary conditions
of the universe [2]. the present lorentzian spacetime is supposed to emerge quantum
mechanically from a euclidean spacetime. leading proposals for such wave functions are
the hartle-hawkings no-boundary wave function [3], the lindes wave function [4] and
the vilenkins tunneling wave function [5]. though there has not still been an unanimous
agreement on the boundary condition of the universe, it is generally accepted that the
universe which tunneled quantum mechanically the euclidean spacetime should have either
an exponentially growing or decaying wave function or a combination of both branches [6].
but the issue of quantum theory of matter elds in a topology changing universe such as
the tunneling universe has not been raised seriously yet.

it is the purpose of this paper to investigate a consistent quantum theory of a scalar
eld in the euclidean region of the topology changing universe such as the tunneling uni-
verse and to construct quantum states explicitly there. to treat the quantum eld in a
curved spacetime there have been used two typical methods: in the conventional approach
the underlying spacetime is xed as a background and matter eld is quantized on it [7],
and in the other approach known as the semiclassical (quantum) gravity the semiclassical
einstein equation with the quantum back-reaction of matter eld and the time-dependent
schodinger equation are derived from the wheeler-dewitt equation for the gravity-matter
system [8,9]. in both approaches the functional schrodinger equation for the scalar eld in
the euclidean region obeys a non-unitary (diusion-like) evolution equation. so the quan-
tization rules of the minkowski spacetime may not be applied directly. to construct the
consistent quantum theory in the euclidean region we propose a method in which one rst
quantizes the wick-rotated gravity-matter system of the euclidean geometry, derives the
time-dependent schrodinger equation and then transforms back via the wick rotation the
quantum states into those of the lorentzian geometry. this method is consistent because
the wick rotations are well dened and so does the time-dependent schrodinger equation
in the euclidean region in the euclidean geometry just as in the lorentzian region of the
lorentzian geometry. it is also useful in that one is able to nd the quantum states explicitly
using the liouville-neumann method which has already been used to nd quantum states
of the scalar eld in the lorentzian regions of spacetime [10].

the organization of the paper is as follows. in sec. ii we quantize the gravity-scalar sys-
tem in the lorentzian geometry and derive the semiclassical einstein equation and the time-
dependent schrodinger equation from the wheeler-dewitt equation in the lorentzian region
where the gravitational wave function oscillates. the region where the gravitational wave
function exhibits an exponential behavior corresponds to a euclidean region of spacetime.
we focus in particular on the schrodinger equation in the euclidean region of spacetime.
in sec.
iii we quantize the euclidean gravity (geometry) coupled to the minimal scalar
eld and derive the time-dependent schrodinger equation together with the semiclassical
einstein equation in the region corresponding to the euclidean region of the lorentzian
geometry. quantum states are found using the liouville-neumann method.
iv
the wick rotation is employed to transform these quantum states dened in terms of the
euclidean geometry into those dened in terms of the lorentzian geometry.

ii. quantum theory in lorentzian geometry

as a simple but interesting quantum cosmological model, let us consider the closed frw
universe minimally coupled to an inaton, a minimal scalar eld. the action for the gravity
with a cosmological constant  and the scalar eld takes the form

before we derive the equation for quantum elds in the euclidean region, we review
briey how to obtain the time-dependent schrodinger equation in the lorentzian region
from the semiclassical (quantum) gravity point of view. in the lorentzian region, where the
wave function for the gravitational eld oscillates, we may adopt the born-oppenheimer
idea that the total wave function is expanded according to dierent mass scales, and the
de broglie-bohm interpretation that the gravitational wave function is equivalent to the
hamilton-jacobi equation with an additional quantum potential. the wave function of the
wheeler-dewitt equation (7) can be set to the form

l(ii)(a) = f (a) exph

back-reaction of the scalar eld is insignicant compared with vg, so that the eective

potential vl has a simple form in fig. 1. the region i of fig. 1, where vl is positive,
corresponds to a part of euclidean spacetime, whereas the region ii, where vl is negative,
corresponds to a part of lorentzian spacetime.

being mostly interested in the quantum creation of the universe from the euclidean
region of the tunneling universe to the lorentzian region, we focus on the region i of fig.
1. though the gravitational motion is prohibited classically in the region i, it is, however,
permitted quantum mechanically. in this region one is tempted to continue analytically the
wave function (8) to get

l(i)(a) = f (a) exph

(21)

but the scalar eld hamiltonian hl keeps the same form.

then the following questions are raised. what is the meaning of the parameter s? is it
an analytic continuation of the cosmological time or a wick-rotated euclidean time? how
to solve eq.
(20), an apparently time-dependent diusion-like equation? what are the
quantization rule [ , ] and the meaning of quantum states of this non-unitary evolution?
to answer these questions and to follow analogy with quantum theory of lorentzian space-
time, we shall consider the quantum theory of the scalar eld by quantizing the euclidean
geometry.

iii. quantum theory in euclidean geometry

to obtain the quantum cosmological model for the euclidean spacetime, we perform the

wick rotation t = i and consider the euclidean metric

(26)

we now wish to obtain the time-dependent schrodinger equation in the euclidean region
i of fig. 1. since the sign of the kinetic term of gravitational eld was reversed due to the
wick rotation, the wave function e of the wheeler-dewitt equation (26) now oscillates in
the region i. this is in contrast with the behavior of the wave function l. thus we may
use the semiclassical quantum gravity approach in sec. ii and ref. [9]. as in the lorentzian
spacetime we may set the wave function in the form

e(a) = f (a) exph

is the scalar eld hamiltonian in the euclidean geometry. it should be remarked that the
wick rotation changed both signs of the kinetic terms of the scalar and gravitational elds.
this is the reason why the euclidean action can not be made positive denite for the gravity-
matter system. now the euclidean region i corresponds to the region where the eective
potential for the gravitational eld

ve(a) =

3m2
p

vg  h hei

(30)

takes positive values. to consolidate this point further, let us remind that h hei is a wick
rotation of h hli, as will be shown later. so the region where ve is positive, coincides
with the region i where vl is positive, too. however, the wave function for the quantized
euclidean geometry oscillates in this region, in contrast with the exponential behavior of
the wave function for the quantized lorentzian geometry. therefore, we are able to obtain
the time-dependent unitary schodinger equation

the cosmological time (32) coincides with the euclidean time in eq. (22).

we now turn to the task to nd quantum states of the scalar eld obeying eq. (31)
explicitly. in ref. [10] the liuoville-neumann method has been used to construct the hilbert
spaces for quantum inatons in the frw background exactly for a quadratic potential and
approximately for a generic potential. similarly we look for the operators that satisfy the
liouville-neumann equation

gaussian states are obtained by taking the expectation value of eq. (35) with respect to

iv. transformation between lorentzian and euclidean

quantum geometries

in the tunneling universe of fig. 1, the lorentzian geometry is sewn to the euclidean
geometry. there should be a matching condition or surgery of two geometries. classically
to match smoothly across the boundary the extrinsic curvature should be continuous across
the boundary. in the frw universe where the lorentzian spacetime is connected to the eu-
clidean spacetime, the extrinsic curvature is given by a. we also require that the geometric
quantities a, a and physical quantities ,  be continuous. sometimes all these are meant
the continuity of wave function of the wheeler-dewitt equation across the boundary just
as the wave function of a quantum mechanical system is continuous across the boundary of
tunneling barrier. though tempted to continue analytically eq. (9) to describe quantum
theory in the euclidean region, we have seen that such a prescription does not provide a
good picture for quantum theory particularly for a gravity-matter system.

in the quantum lorentzian geometry, the quantum theory of the scalar eld in the
euclidean region i is dened in an ad hoc manner via the non-unitary schrodinger equation.
besides, the quantum operators  and , and all the quantization rules are dened in the
exactly same manner as in lorentzian region. this is not obviously a wick-rotation. on the
other hand, in the quantum euclidean geometry the oscillatory behavior of the wheeler-
dewitt equation in the same region i enables one to apply the semiclassical quantum gravity
approach to obtain a well-dened quantum theory of the scalar eld. to get a quantum
picture for the scalar eld in the euclidean region there should be a transformation of the
hilbert space constructed in the quantum euclidean geometry into that of the quantum
lorentzian geometry.

in the de broglie-bohm interpretation the canonical momenta are related to the actions

a =

sl(ii)

a

, e,a =

se
a

.

a is well dened in the region ii (a  a0), since

(a)2 = 3m2

p avl(a)  0,
whereas e,a is well dened in the region i (a  a0), since
p ave(a)  0.

(e,a)2 = 3m2

(39)

(40)

(41)

to nd the momentum a of the lorentzian geometry in the euclidean region i we transform
back e,a by the inverse wick rotation  = is. hence, momenta in the lorentzian and
euclidean geometries are related by the following transformations

e,a = ia,
e, = i.

(42)

by making use of eqs. (39) and (42) we recover the gravitational eld wave function (18)
of the lorentzian geometry from that of the euclidean geometry:

e(a) = f (a) exph

i
h

se(a)i  l(a) = f (a) exph

1
h

sl(i)(a)i.

(43)

8

we turn to the transformation of quantum states of the scalar eld. in the region ii the
scalar eld has the energy expectation value with respect to the symmetric gaussian state
h i = c = 0

h hli = 2h2a3 

l(ii)
t

t

l(ii)l(ii)

2
2

c(cid:17)  1#v (c = 0).

(44)

similarly, in the region i of the euclidean geometry the energy expectation value is given by

h hei = 2h2a3 

e


e


+ 22a3"exp(cid:16) h2

ee

2
2

c(cid:17)  1#v (c = 0).

(45)

thus h hei is the true wick rotation of h hli. this justies the fact that the region i of the
lorentzian geometry coincides with the region where ve is positive and the wave function
oscillates. the wick rotation transforms he back into hl and recovers the positive signature
of the kinetic term. likewise, eq. (20) is the wick rotation of eq. (31). therefore, in the
region i all quantum states of the scalar eld in the lorentzian geometry are obtained by
wick rotating those in the euclidean geometry.

how can we nd directly quantum states in the lorentzian geometry? for this purpose

we should nd the quantization rule in the region i

[ , ] = h,

which follows from eq. (39) and the standard quantization in the euclidean geometry

[ e, e,] = ih.

(46)

(47)

though not rmly established, we may use the non-unitary version of the liouville-neumann
equation

h


s

o + [ o, hl] = 0.

two operators are found

a+(s) = l(i)(s)  a3 l(i)(s)
a(s) =

l(i)(s) = 0.

(50)

the operators a+(s) and a(s) play the same role as a( ) and a( ), respectively. note
that eq. (50) is the wick rotation of eq. (35).

v. conclusion

we have studied quantum eld theory of matter in the universe undergoing a topology
change from the euclidean region into the lorentzian region. it is shown that the semi-
classical gravity derived from canonical quantum gravity provides a consistent scheme for
quantum eld theory in such topology changing universes. the lorentzian and euclidean
regions of spacetime are classied according to the behavior of the wave function of the
gravitational eld with the quantum back-reaction of matter included. in the lorentzian
region the gravitational wave function oscillates. provided a cosmological time is prop-
erly chosen along the trajectory of oscillating gravitational wave function, the semiclassical
einstein equation has the same form as the classical einstein equation with the quantum
back-reaction of matter as a source. the time-dependent schrodinger equation is identical
to canonical quantum eld equation.

on the other hand, in the euclidean region the gravitational wave function shows either
an exponentially growing or decaying behavior or a superposition of them. one may derive
the semiclassical einstein equation and time-dependent schrodinger equation in the sense
of analytic continuation. however, it is found that the schrodinger equation evolves like a
diusion equation, not preserving unitarity, and the quantization rule diers from the usual
one in the lorentzian spacetime.

in order to construct a consistent quantum theory of matter eld we have proposed
a scheme in which the gravity-matter system is wick-rotated in the euclidean region of
spacetime and the semiclassical (quantum) gravity is derived from the wheeler-dewitt
equation for the wick-rotated euclidean geometry. the time-dependent schrodinger equa-
tion is well dened as in the lorentzian region and quantum states are found using the
liouville-neumann method. finally these quantum states are transformed via the inverse
wick rotation back into those of the lorentzian geometry.

this quantum eld theory applies to the universe that emerged quantum mechanically
it would be interesting to see the physical conse-

from a euclidean region of spacetime.
