we study the witten diagram with general spinor eld exchange on the (d + 1)-

dimensional euclidean anti-de sitter space, which is necessary to calculate four-point

correlation functions with spinor elds when we make use of the ads/cft correspondence,

especially, in supersymmetric cases. we show that the amplitude can be expressed by that

with scalar eld exchange, which have been previously calculated, and we explicitly give

our result of the calculation. we discuss the short distance expansion of the amplitude

with the interpretation as the operator product expansion of the conformal eld theory,

according to the ads/cft correspondence.

may, 1999

1. introduction

recently it has been conjectured [1] that string/m theory on (d + 1)-dimensional

anti de sitter space adsd+1 times an einstein manifold is dual to the large n limit

of d-dimensional conformal eld theory cftd on the boundary of adsd+1. according
to this conjecture, the dual of type iib string theory on ads5  s5 is four-dimensional
n = 4 su (n ) supersymmetric yang-mills theory. in [2,3], a more precise dictionary of the
ads/cft correspondence was proposed to be that the partition function of the boundary

cft with source terms is equal to the partition function of the string theory on adsd+1
with xed boundary values of elds. since the t hooft coupling g2
ymn is proportional
to the fourth power of the ratio of the radius of adsd+1 to the string scale, the string

partition function at the leading order in the strong coupling expansion can be estimated

by the classical type iib supergravity. in a schematical form, the correspondence can be

written [3] as

*exp z(ads) o0!+cft

= exp(cid:16)  isugra(cl)(cid:17)

(1.1)

where cl denotes the solution of the equations of motion of the elds satisfying the dirich-

let boundary condition in the supergravity and the boundary value of cl is identied with

the source 0 up to a conformal factor. this gkp/w relation (1.1) has been checked

for two- and three-point functions [223] and showed the precise agreement between two

sides of (1.1).

it is interesting and important to check the duality mapping (1.1) for four-point func-

tions [5,2432]. on the cft side, the forms of two- and three-point functions are de-

termined by the conformal symmetry, but four-point functions are only determined up

to a function of the cross ratios, so four-point functions contain the detailed information

about the dynamics of the theory. although multi-point functions of the four-dimensional

strongly coupled cft have not been understood very well, the gkp/w relation in princi-

ple facilitates to calculate them from the classical supergravity. in [24,25], the four-point
function of operators o, oc corresponding to dilaton eld  and axion eld c were con-
sidered. it was found that the contact diagram gives a logarithmic term to the four-point

function [25]. it was shown that this behavior also occurs in scalar exchange [29,30] and

gauge boson exchange amplitudes [27]. therefore, upon the inclusion of graviton exchange

contribution, the logarithmic terms might have canceled each other out but the recent

calculation of graviton exchange amplitudes proved such terms to actually remain in the

1

complete four-point function [31]. in [29], it has been argued that the logarithmic terms

are due to the mixture of a single trace operator and double trace operators in the operator

product expansion which correspond to the exchanged scalar eld and the two external

scalar elds, respectively, and that the double trace operators in the cft correspond to

two-particle bound states in the supergravity on ads. since the new states have not fully

been understood, it is important to study if two-particle bound states contribute to the

other correlation functions.

in this paper, as a model, we shall consider yukawa theory on adsd+1; a eld the-

ory on adsd+1 of spinors and scalars with the yukawa interaction. particularly, we will

estimate a diagram with the spinor exchange in the model. this is a nontrivial step from

the calculation of bosonic eld exchange diagrams [2931]. from the gkp/w relation,

this diagram on ads may contribute to four-point correlation functions of two spinor and

two scalar operators in cfts. therefore, the diagram we will calculate is needed to be

evaluated to obtain some four-point functions in cfts with spinor elds, for example, in

some supersymmetric models. in this paper, we will show that the spinor exchange ampli-

tude can be reduced to the scalar exchange amplitude and its derivative. this allows us to

conrm the structure of the spinor indices of the four-point function and explicitly deter-

mine the function of cross ratios, which cannot be determined solely from the conformal

invariance.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, using the yukawa theory as a model,

we will illustrate how the spinor exchange diagram appears as the witten diagram in the

gkp/w relation. in section 3, we will show the calculation of the spinor exchange diagram

by relating it to the scalar exchange diagram and present the explicit expression. section 4

is devoted to some discussion about the operator product expansion of the spinor exchange

amplitude. in appendix, the derivation of the witten propagator and the bulk-to-bulk

propagator of spinor elds is explained. also, some useful formulae concerned with the

propagator can be found, as will be indicated in the text.

2. yukawa model on the ads space

in this section, we will consider spinor exchange diagrams for a four-point correlation

function in the yukawa model on the (d + 1)-dimensional euclidean ads space. in this

paper, we will use the metric in the poincare representation; ds2 = 1

in the yukawa model, we have a spinor eld  and a scalar eld  interacting with

each other through the yukawa interaction. the action s is given by

(2.2)

where m denotes the regularized boundary of the ads space, i.e. z0 = . hij is the

induced metric on the surface m. after the completion of our calculation, we will take

the regularization parameter  to zero. this prescription has been discussed for spinor

elds in [9]. the surface term has been discussed in [8] to be necessarily added to the

bulk lagrangian, and the normalization of the term was determined in [11] and [33] to be

g = 1.

now we will consider the solution of the equations of motion

left- or right-handed chiral components of these elds, as we will see below soon. for the

(z, ~x) = p+k(z, ~x)u (z  x),
where p is the chiral projection operators given by p = 1

2 (1  0).

for the interacting case i .e.  6= 0, it is convenient to introduce the bulk-to-bulk

regularized propagator dend by

(6d  m) s(z, w) = s(z, w)(cid:16)6d  m(cid:17) =

though we do not need it in this paper, except when vering that

(2.12)

in the limit   0, we will give the explicit form of s(z, w)

(2.15)

the function f (, , ; z) is the hypergeometric function[37]. the derivation of the prop-

agator (2.13) is given in appendix.

using the propagator (2.13), the solution of the equations of motion (2.3) is given by

a set of recursion relations [9]

(z) = (0)

(z) = (0)

 (z)  z dd+1wgws(z, w)(w)(w),
 (z)  z dd+1wgw (w)(w)s(w, z),
 (z)  z dd+1wgwg(z, w) (w)(w),

(z) =z dd~xk(z, ~x)(~x)  z dd+1wgwg(z, w) (w)(w)

(2.16)

where k(z, ~x) is the regularized witten propagator [6,5] of the scalar eld. g(z, w) is

the regularized bulk-to-bulk propagator [5] of it. in this paper, we will not use the explicit

5

form of them. solving the equation (2.16) recursively and substituting the solution into the

action (2.2), we can nd the bulk action including the spinors vanishing and obtain that

s = sb + sf , where sb gives the two-point function of the scalar eld in the boundary
cft and

with h = d. note that the terms included in o(3) have more than four external legs.
here we can see in (2.17) that the rst term gives the two-point function of the spinors in

the boundary cft [9,8] and that the second the three-point function with two spinors and
a scalar [10]. as in the case for scalar elds [6,5], we should take the limit   0 after the
calculation when we evalute the two-point function [9]. but, since it seems that there is

nothing wrong with the exchange of the order for the other multi-point functions, we will
take the limit   0 at the begining of the calculation. the third and fourth contribute
to four-point functions in the boundary cft. the third term s   has four legs of the
spinor elds and can be easily related to a scalar exchange amplitude with four legs of

with the general value of the weights i (i = 1,    , 4). the translational invariance
on the boundary implys that a(~x1, ~x2, ~x3, ~x4) = a(~x13, ~x23, 0, ~x43). under the inversion
z  z = z/z2 and ~x  ~x = ~x/|~x|2, the integration measure is invariant and

essentially the scalar exchange diagram. in this paper, we will follow the method which has

been given by liu [29] to give our amplitude b(~x1, ~x2, ~x4) by using the mellin-barnes rep-

4. discussion

in this paper, we have calculated the spinor exchange amplitude by showing that we

can reduce it to the scalar exchange amplitude and its derivative. from our nal result

(3.14) and (3.15), we can see that there are three serires of poles from the three gamma

functions, as is similar to the case of scalar elds [29]. therefore, we can easily understand

that the appearance of the logarithmic terms in the short distance expansion, for example
when ~x12  0 has the same cause as in the scalar exchange diagram; such terms appear,
since we have double poles in the integration over s in (3.15) when the position of the pole

from one of the gamma functions coincides with that from another.

apart from the issue of the logarithmic terms, we would like to discuss the operator

product expansion in the cft, according to the ads/cft correspondance. let us suppose

that we are now cosidering a yukawa model with three spinor elds 1, 3,  and two
scalar elds 2, 4, which is the same situation as in section 3. the spinor elds 1, 3,
and  have their mass which correspond to the weight 1, 3, and +, respectively, and
the scalar elds 2, 4 to the conformal domensions 2, 4. the elds interact with each
other only through the following yukawa interactions: 2 1 and 4 3. in the rest of
this section, we will show that the operator product expansions which can be determined

10

from the two- and three-point function is consistent with, at least, the rst two terms of

the short distance expansion of the spinor exchange diagram which we calculated in the
previous section, when we take account of only the contribution from the poles s = +
2
the exchange amplitude. for this purpose, let us recall the gkp/w relation (1.1) in our

case

as we can guess from the section 2, the two-point correlation function of the spinors is

given [8,9] by

any particular value of the conformal dimesion, as we have mentioned above. similarly,

we can nd all the nonvanishing three-point function [10]:

turn out to be

condition, we have another contribution from the poles s = 12

poles. in the case that 12

poles, either. then we can see that the contribution from the pole s = 12

by combining two- and three-point functions in the same way as before, even though we

do not assume any particular value of c12 and c1212 in the two- and three-point
functions, repectively. this discrepancy has been similarly observed in scalar exchange

diagrams [29].

12

if we do not impose any of the above condition on the weights, which is the case in the
type iib sugra on ads5  s5, we would have logarithmic terms in the spinor exchange
diagram. these terms have been discussed rst in [25] and then in [2631]. although

these logarithmic terms had been expected to cancel out each other in a realistic four-

point functions, the four-point function of scalar elds was calculated in [31] to show that

such terms remains even in a realistic correlation function. therefore it is likely that they

also exist in realistic four-point functions with spinor elds.

appendix a. the bulk-to-bulk spinor propagator

in this appendix, we will give the derivation of the bulk-to-bulk propagator of spinor

elds on the euclidean adsd+1 space (see [36,38] for the lorentzian counterpart). in addi-

tion, we will explain how the propagator transforms under the inversion, as we mentioned

in the text.

firstly, we seek the solutions of the dirac equation (2.3) with  = 0; i.e.

(6d  m)  =(cid:18)z0aa

in the momentum space, the solutions are given by

(cid:26) (k)(z0, ~k) = (k)(z0, ~k)a(~k),
(cid:26) (k)(z0, ~k) = a(~k) (k)(z0, ~k) = a(~k) i

now we proceed to consider the propagator s(z, w) under the inversion tranformation
z2 . since g (z, w) is invariant under the inversion (3.2) because of the

appendix b. the boundary-to-bulk spinor propagator

in this appendix, we will review the boundary-to-bulk propagator of spinor eld which

has been derived in [5,8]. as in the scalar case [3], one can obtain the boundary-to-bulk

spinor propagator by performing the inversion to the solution of the dirac equation, which

turns out to depends only on z0. as was pointed out in [8], upon the inversion of the
solutions, we need to perform the local lorentz transformation to preserve the gauge-

xing condition of the vielbein. instead of this procedure, we will give a hopefully easier

derivation of the boundary-to-bulk propagator. the inversion of the dirac operator is

given by

6d(z) = u (z)1 6d(z)u (z) +
where u (z) is dened in (2.7). this relation follows from

du (z) =
u (z)1u (z) = j (z) ,
is the conformal jacobian dened by

where j (z) =   2 zz

=

1
z2 j (z).

from (b.1), the dirac operator in the coordinate z can be written as

6d(z)  m = u (z)h 6d(z) + m 

using this relation, we can easily see that

satises the dirac equation (6d(z)  m) = 0. since we impose on the boundary-to-bulk
propagator of spinor eld  the boundary condition that  = 0 on the boundary z0 = 0,
it should be projected on 0 = 1.

the boundary-to-bulk propagator can also be obtained as the limit of the bulk-to-bulk

propagator with one point approaching the boundary. from (a.13), we can see that

s(z; , ~x)  +

2 + (z, ~x)

(b.6)

in the limit   0. note that the similar property for the scalar propagator is used in
[41] to relate the boundary behavior of the bulk eld and the expectation value of the

corresponding operator in the boundary theory.
