abstract

the structure of spinning particle suggested by the rotating kerr-
newman ( black hole ) solution, super-kerr-newman solution and the
kerr-sen solution to low energy string theory is considered. main pecu-
liarities of the kerr spinning particle are discussed: a vortex of twisting
principal null congruence, singular ring and the kerr source representing
a rotating relativistic disk of the compton size. a few stringy structures
can be found in the real and complex kerr geometry. low-energy string
theory predicts the existence of a heterotic string placed on the sharp
boundary of this disk. the obtained recently supergeneralization of the
kerr-newman solution suggests the existence of extra axial singular line
and fermionic traveling waves concentrating near these singularities.

we discuss briey a possibility of experimental test of these predic-

tions.

introduction

the kerr solution is well known as a eld of the rotating black hole. however,
for the case of a large angular momentum l, | a |= l/m  m, all the horizons
of the kerr metric are absent, and the naked ring-like singularity is appeared.
this naked singularity has many unpleasant manifestations and must be hidden
inside a rotating disk-like source. the kerr solution with | a | m displays
some remarkable features indicating a relation to the structure of the spinning
elementary particles.

in the 1969 carter [1] observed, that if three parameters of the kerr - new-
man solution are adopted to be (h=c=1 )
a 
1022, l = ma = 1/2, then one obtains a model for the four parameters of the
electron: charge, mass, spin and magnetic moment, and the giromagnetic ratio
is automatically the same as that of the dirac electron. israel [2] has introduced
a disk-like source for the kerr eld, and it was shown by hamity [3] that this
source represents a rigid relativistic rotator. a model of microgeon with kerr
metric was suggested [4] and an analogy of this model with string models [5].
then a model of the kerr-newman source in the form of oblate spheroid was
suggested [7]. it was shown that material of the source must have very exotic
properties: null energy density and negative pressure. an attempt to explain
these properties on the basis of the volume casimir eect was given in work [6].
the electromagnetic properties of the material are close to those of a supercon-
ductor [6, 7], that allows to consider singular ring of the kerr source as a closed
vortex string like the nielsen-olesen and witten superconducting strings. since
1992 black holes have paid attention of string theory. in 1992 the kerr solution
was generalized by sen to low energy string theory [8]. it was shown that black
holes can be considered as fundamental string states, and the point of view
has appeared that some of black holes can be treated as elementary particles
[9]. the obtained recently super-kerr-newman solution [10, 11] represents a
natural combination of the kerr spinning particle and superparticle models and
predicts the existence of extra axial singularity and fermionic traveling waves
on the kerr-newman background.

2 kerr singular ring

the kerr string-like singularity appears in the rotating bh solutions instead of
the point-like singularity of the non-rotating bh. the simple solution possessing
the kerr singular ring was obtained by appel in 1887 (!) [12]. it can be consid-
ered as a newton or coulomb analogue to the kerr solution. when the point-like
source of the coulomb solution f = 1/r = 1/p(x  xo)2 + (y  yo)2 + (z  zo)2
is shifted to a complex point of space (xo, yo, zo)  (0, 0, ia), the kerr singular
ring arises on the real slice of space-time. the complex equation of singularity
r = 0 represents a ring as an intersection of plane and sphere. the complex
radial distance r can be expressed in the oblate spheroidal coordinates r and
: r = r + ia cos . the kerr singular ring is a branch line of the space on
two sheets: positive one covered by r  0, and negative one, an anti-world,
covered by r  0. the sheets are connected by disk r = 0 spanned by singular
ring. the physical elds change signs and directions on the negative sheet.
truncation of the negative sheet allows one to avoid the twosheetedness.
in
this case the elds will acquire a shock crossing the disk, and some material
sources have to be spread on the disk surface to satisfy the eld equations. the
structure of electromagnetic eld near the disk suggests then that the nega-

2

tive sheet of space can be considered as a mirror image of the real world in the
rotating superconducting mirror.

the source of kerr-newman solution, like the appel solution, can be con-
sidered from complex point of view as a particle propagating along a complex
world-line xi( ) [13, 14] parametrized by complex time  . the objects de-
scribed by the complex world-lines occupy an intermediate position between
particle and string. like the string they form the two-dimensional surfaces or
the world-sheets in the space-time. it was shown that the complex kerr source
may be considered as a complex hyperbolic string which requires an orbifold-
like structure of the world-sheet. it induces a related orbifold-like structure of
the kerr geometry [14] which is closely connected with the above mentioned
twosheetedness.

3 kerr congruence and disk-like source

second remarkable peculiarity of the kerr solution is the twisting principal null
congruence (pnc) which can be considered as a vortex of null radiation. this
vortex propagates via disk from negative sheet of space onto positive one forming
a caustic at singular ring. pnc plays fundamental role in the structure of the
kerr geometry. the kerr metric can be represented in the kerr-schild form
gik = ik + 2hkikk, where  is metric of an auxiliary minkowski space and h is
a scalar function. vector eld ki(x) is null, kiki = 0, and tangent to pnc. the
kerr pnc is geodesic and shear free [15]. congruences with such properties
are described by the kerr theorem via complex function y (x) representing a
projective spinor coordinate y (x) =  2/  1. the null vector eld ki(x) can be
expressed in spinor form k  idxi.

the above complex representation of source allows one to obtain the kerr
congruence by a retarded-time construction [13, 14]. the complex light cone
with the vertex at some point x0 of the complex world line (xi x0i)(xi xi
0) = 0
can be split into two families of null planes: left and right. in spinor form
this splitting can be described as

xi = x0i + i ,

(1)

where right (or left) null planes can be obtained keeping  constant and
varying , or keeping  constant and varying . the rays of the twisting kerr
congruence arise as real slice of the left null planes of the complex light cones
emanated from the complex world line [13, 14].

replacement of the negative sheet by a disk-like source at surface r = 0
allows one to avoid twosheetedness of the kerr space. however, there is still
a small region of causality violation on positive sheet of space. by the lopez
suggestion this region has to be also covered by source [7]. the minimal value
of r covering this region is classical radius re = e2
2m . the resulting disk-like
source has a thickness of order re and its degree of oblateness is 1  137.

4 stringy suggestions

in 1974, in the frame of einstein gravity the model of microgeon with the kerr-
newman metric was considered [4], where singular ring was used as a waveguide
for wave excitations. it was recognized soon [5] that singular ring represents
in fact a string with traveling waves. further, in dilaton gravity, the string
solutions with traveling waves have paid considerable attention. the obtained
by sen generalization of the kerr solution to low energy string theory with axion
and dilaton [8] was analyzed in [16]. it was shown that, in spite of the strong
deformation of metric by dilaton (leading to a change the type of metric from
type d to type i), the kerr pnc survives in the kerr-sen solution and retains
the properties to be geodesic and shear free. it means that the kerr theorem
and the above complex representation are valid for the kerr-sen solution too.
it has also been obtained that the eld of the kerr-sen solution near the kerr
singular ring is similar to the eld around a fundamental heterotic string that
suggested stringy interpretation of the kerr singular ring.

5 supergeneralization

description of spinning particle based only on the bosonic elds cannot be com-
plete. on the other hand the fermionic models of spinning particles and super-
particles based on grassmann coordinates have paid considerable attention. in
[10, 11] a natural way to combine the kerr spinning particle and superparticle
models was suggested leading to a non-trivial super-kerr-newman black hole
solution.

the simplest consistent supergeneralization of einstein gravity represents
an unication of the gravitational eld gik, with a spin 3/2 rarita-schwinger
eld i . there exists the problem of triviality of supergravity solutions. any
exact solution of einstein gravity is indeed a trivial solution of supergravity
eld equations with a zero eld i. starting from such a solution and using
supertranslations, one can easily turn the gravity solution into a form containing
the spin-3/2 eld i. however, since this spin-3/2 eld can be gauged away by
reverse transformations such supersolutions have to be considered as trivial.

the hint how to avoid this triviality problem was given by complex repre-
sentation of the kerr geometry. one notes that from complex point of view the
schwarzschild and kerr geometries are equivalent and connected by a trivial
complex shift. the non-trivial twisting structure of the kerr geometry arises as
a result of the shifted real slice regarding the source [13, 14].

similarly, it is possible to turn a trivial super black hole solution into a

non-trivial if one nds an analogue to the real slice in superspace.

the trivial supershift can be represented as a replacement of the complex
0( )  ii  + ii , parametrized
, or as a corresponding coordinate supershift

world line by a superworldline x i
by grassmann coordinates ,

0( ) = xi

xi = xi + ii   ii ;

 =  + ,

 =  + .

assuming that coordinates xi before the supershift are the usual c-number
coordinates one sees that coordinates acquire nilpotent grassmann contribu-
tions after supertranslations. therefore, there appears a natural splitting of the
space-time coordinates on the c-number body-part and a nilpotent part - the
so called soul. the body subspace of superspace, or b-slice, is a submanifold
where the nilpotent part is equal to zero, and it is a natural analogue to the
real slice in complex case.

reproducing the real slice procedure of the kerr geometry in superspace
one obtains the condition of proportionality of the commuting spinors (x)
determining the pnc of the kerr geometry and anticommuting spinors  and
, as a consequence of the b-slice and superlightcone constraints one obtains a
 = (x). the initial supergauge freedom
submanifold of superspace  = (x),
is lost now, and there appears a non-linear realization of broken supersymmetry
introduced by volkov and akulov [17, 18] and considered in n=1 supergravity
by deser and zumino [19]. it is assumed that this construction is similar to
 (x) represent
the higgs mechanism of the usual gauge theories, and  (x),
goldstone fermion which can be eaten by appropriate local supertransformation
with a corresponding redenition of the tetrad and the spin-3/2 eld i.

however, the complex character of supertranslations demands to extend this

scheme to n=2 supergravity.

in this way the self-consistent super-kerr-newman solutions to broken n=2
supergravity coupled to goldstone fermion eld was obtained [11]. the solu-
tion describes the massless dirac wave eld propagating on the kerr-newman
background along the kerr congruence. besides the kerr singular ring solution
contains an extra axial singularity and traveling waves propagating along the
ring-like and axial singularity.

the axial singularity represents a half-innite line threading the kerr sin-
gular ring and passing to negative sheet of the kerr geometry. the position
and character of axial singularity depend on the index n of elementary excita-
tion. the case n = 1/2 is exclusive: there are two decreasing singularities
which are situated symmetrically at  = 0 and  = .

6 problem of hard core

the obtained supergeneralization is based on the massless goldstone eld. at
present stage of investigation our knowledge regarding the origin of the gold-
stone fermion is very incompleted. analyzing the wess-zumino model of super-
qed and some other schemes of spontaneously broken supersymmetry [18], one
sees that it can leads to massless goldstone fermions, at least in the region of
massless elds out of the bh horizons.

however, for the known parameters of spinning particles, the angular mo-
mentum is very high, regarding the mass parameter, and the black hole horizons

5

disappear. the resulting object is neither black and nor hole, and the con-
sidered above disk-like hard core region is naked. structure of this region
represents a very important and extremely complicated problem. among the
possible eld models for description this region could be mentioned the landau-
ginzburg model, super-qed, non-abelian gauge models, seiberg-witten theory,
as well as the recent ideas on the connement caused by extra dimensions in
the bulk/boundary ( ads/cft correspondence) models [21]. apparently, this
problem is very far from resolution at present, and one of the most dicult
points can be the concordance of the eld model with the rotating disk-like bag
of the kerr geometry.

7 suggestions to experimental test

the predicted comparative big size of the disk-like bag looks as a serious contra-
diction to the traditional point of view on the structureless, point-like electron.
however, the suggested by qed virtual photons surrounding electron in the re-
gion of compton size, zitterbewegung and the vacuum zero-point uctuations,
spreading the position of electron, can be treated as some indirect evidences for
the existence of an geometrical structure in the compton region. at least, one
can assume that region of virtual photons has a tendency to be very ordered
with formation of the kerr congruence and the ring-like singularity.

the modern progress in the formation of polarized beams of spinning parti-
cles suggests the possible methods for experimental test of the main predicted
feature of the kerr spinning particle - its highly oblated form. in particular, it
could be the method proposed in [20] based on estimation of the cross section
dierences between transversely and longitudinally polarized states in proton-
proton collisions. one proposes that similar experiment could be more eective
for the electron-electron collisions. another possible way of experimental test
could be the analysis of the diraction of photons on the polarized electrons.

apparently, the strong inuence of vacuum uctuations will not allow one
to observe the predicted very high oblateness of electrons. nevertheless, one
expects that an essential eect should be observed if the kerr source model
reects the reality.
