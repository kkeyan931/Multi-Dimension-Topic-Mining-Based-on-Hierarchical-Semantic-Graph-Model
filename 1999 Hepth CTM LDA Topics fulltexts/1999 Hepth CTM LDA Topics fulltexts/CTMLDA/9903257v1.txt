abstract:a nonlinear charged version of the (2+1)-anti
de sitter black hole solution is derived. the source to the ein-
stein equations is a born-infeld electromagnetic eld, which
in the weak eld limit becomes the (2+1)-maxwell eld. the
obtained einstein-born-infeld solution for certain range of the
parameters (mass, charge, cosmological and the born-infeld
constants) represent a static circularly symmetric black hole.
although the covariant metric components and the electric
eld do not exhibit a singular behavior at r = 0 the curvature
invariants are singular at that point.

einstein gravity in (2+1)-dimensions has been inten-
sively studied in this decade [13], largely because of the
existence of black holes solutions in (2+1)-anti de sitter
spacetimes [4,5], which possess certain features inherent
to the (3+1)-black holes. moreover, it is believed that
(2+1)-gravity will provide new insights towards a better
understanding of the physically relevant (3+1)-gravity.
nevertheless, to our knowledge, the existing solutions in
(2+1)-einstein theory, do not consider equations of mo-
tion which are non-linear in the maxwell eld. since
non-linear electromagnetic lagrangians, in particular the
born-infeld lagrangian [6], arise in open string theory
(the low-energy eective action for a constant electro-
magnetic eld is precisely the born-infeld action) [7,8],
they deserve a special attention. in this context, string
theory has emerged as the most promising candidate for
the consistent quantization of gravity. in particular, as
we mentioned above, the open string theory has born-
infeld coupled vector elds, but it is not clear that this
remains the case after compactication to three dimen-
sional space with negative cosmological constant . on
the other hand, the born-infeld electrodynamics is free
from some singularities appearing in the classical theory
of electromagnetic eld and one may guess that string

theories with born-infeld type eective actions should
also be free from physical singularities .

it should be mentioned that born-infeld theory has
recently attracted considerable interest in various con-
texts [9,14]. among other notable features, string theory
has become a theory that gives interesting answers to-
wards other elds, such as the physics of black holes,
cosmology, etc.

in (2+1)-dimensions, electromagnetic theories can be
constructed from lagrangians (without higher deriva-
tives) depending upon a single (non-vanishing) invari-
4 fabf ab, which can be expressed in terms of
ant f = 1
the electric (vector ) and magnetic (scalar) elds:
in
a lorentzian frame, for an observer moving with the 3-
velocity va, the electric and the magnetic elds are cor-
respondingly dened as

ea = fabvb, b =

1
2

abcfbcva,

(1)

where latin indices run the values 0, 1, 2 and abc is the
totally anti-symmetric levi-civita symbol with 012 = 1,
usually the va is oriented along the time coordinate, i.e,
va = a

t , with such a choice

ea = fa0, b = f12.

(2)

thus the invariant can be expressed by f  1
2 (b2  e 2).
in general one can construct a (2+1)-einstein theory
coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics starting from the
action

with the electromagnetic lagrangian l(f ) unspecied
explicitly at this stage; physically one requires the la-
grangian to coincide with the maxwell one at small values
of the electromagnetic elds, l(f )maxwell = f/4. we
are using units in which c = g = 1, because of the ambi-
guity in the denition of the gravitational constant (there
is not newtonian gravitational limit in (2+1)-dimensions)
we prefer to maintain the factor 1/16 in the action to
keep the parallelism with (3+1)-gravity. varying this ac-
tion with respect to gravitational eld gives the einstein
equations

gab + gab = 8tab,

tab = gabl(f )  facf c

while the variation with respect to the electromagnetic
potential aa entering in fab = ab,a  aa,b, yields the
electromagnetic eld equations

a(cid:0)f abl,f(cid:1) = 0.

we are denoting the derivative of l(f ) with respect to
f by l,f . in what follows we shall restrict ourselves to
the study of the born-infeld nonlinear electrodynamics
with lagrangian

we obtain from the last expression the right e = q/r in
(2+1)-dimensions. the born-infeld eld is characterized
by a charge density distribution e, which can be eval-
uated from the maxwell equations div ~e =  ~e = 2e,
which in the considered case amount to

div ~e =

as a concrete solution of einstein-born-infeld dynam-
ical equations we present a static self-consistent solution.
to derive it, we consider a (2+1)-static circularly metric
of the form

ds2 = f (r)dt2 +

where f (r) is an unknown function of the variable r. we
restrict the electric eld to be

the invariant then is given by

2f = e 2(r).

substituting (11) and (12) into the electromagnetic eld
equations (9) we arrive at

which integrates as

r  re(r)

e(r) =

where q is an integration constant having the meaning of
the charge, as one could expect. in the maxwell limit,

where r0 = q/b.
integral of e is equal to q, in eect

it is easy to verify that the surface

we would like to point out the regular behavior of the
vector ~e of the electric eld and the surface charge distri-
bution e, the same regular behavior one encounters for
the static spherically symmetric electric eld in (3+1)-
born-infeld theory.

2q2ln(r +pr2 + q2/b2).

from this last expression one sees that there is a con-
tribution of the born-infeld eld to the term with the
cosmological constant.

having explicitly the metric one easily calculates the

curvature tensor components:

(23)

it is surprising that the covariant metric and curvature
components do not exhibit a singular behavior in neigh-
borhood of the origin at r = 0. (3+1)-static and axially
symmetric black holes do not behave in such a manner.
nevertheless this solution is singular at r = 0 in the
sense that its invariant characteristics such as the ricci
scalar and the ricci square blow up at r = 0, (the rie-
mann tensor squared is not necessarily evaluated since in
(2+1)-dimension the riemann tensor is given in terms of
the ricci tensor, curvature scalar and the metric tensor).
additionally in (2+1)-dimension one consider the behav-
ior of the invariant det(rab)/ det(gab) [15], thus one has
to evaluate the invariants

r, rabrab,

det(rab)
det(gab)

for  < 0. now entering rextr into f (r) = 0 one obtains a
relation between mass, charge, cosmological constant and
the born-infeld parameter, which can be solved explicitly
for the massthe extreme one

mextr = 2q2 ln   q

 ! .

(28)

we have an extreme black hole if  < 0, mextr > 0 and
q2 < b2, this last constraint arises from  < 4b2q2/(q2 
b2) when one demands mextr > 0. fixing the values
of the mextr for given values of q, b and  one has a
black hole solution with inner and outer horizons when
m > mextr. for m < mextr one has a soliton solution,
i.e., there are no horizons at all and we have a naked
singularity (see fig. (1)). it may occur that for certain
values of the parameters there is only one positive root of
the equation f (r) = 0  the horizon rh > 0  in such case
one has also a black hole solution. a similar analysis can
be carried out for other rextr which arises for  > 0, this
important case will be treated elsewhere.

since these scalars go to innity at r = 0, we conclude
that they are singular at this point.

this solution is a black hole. to establish this assertion
one has to demonstrate the existence of horizons, which
require the vanishing of the gtt component, i.e., f (r) = 0.
the roots of this equation give the location of the hori-
zons (inner and outer in our case). since this equation is
a transcendental one, we are not able, as it is usual for
charged (2+1)-black holes, to express the roots analyti-
cally, even for the charged static btz solution, the roots
are expressed in terms of the lambert w (x) function.
to overcome this diculty we study the extreme case, in
which the derivative of r(f (r)) = 0 gives

with mass m , cosmological constant  = 1/l2, and
charge q. hence for  = 1/l2 our solution at innity
behaves as anti-de sitter spacetime. as can be seen di-
rectly from this btz metric, it is singular at r = 0. if

one require additionally the vanishing of the cosmological
constant one arrives at a solution reported in [16].

as regards the analytical extension of our solution, one
has to follow step by step the procedure presented in the
standard textbooks (for instance [17]) to determine the
kruskal-szekeres coordinates. first one has to integrate

for the tortoise r coordinate: r =r 1/f (r)dr, which in
our case has no expression in terms of elementary func-
tions, next one denes the null coordinate u and v by
u = t  r, v = t + r; in these coordinates the studied
metric acquires the form

ds2 = f (r)dudv + r2d2,

(31)

where r has to be interpreted as function of u and v,
r = r(u, v). further, one introduces null kruskal-
szekeres coordinates u = eu and v = ev where
 and  to be chosen appropriately, nally one intro-
duces the kruskal-szekeres coordinates t = (u + v )/2,
x= (v-u)/2, arriving at the kruskal extension.

if one were interested in the thermodynamics of the
obtained solution one would to evaluate the temperature
of the black hole, which is given in terms of its surface
gravity by [19,20]

(32)

in general, for a spherically symmetric (and for circu-
larly symmetric in (2+1)-dimensions) system the surface
gravity can be computed via (for our signature)

where now d2 = d2 + sin2d2. as in the (2+1)-
case, here there is also a contribution to the cosmological
constant term of the nonlinear eld. the corresponding
electric eld is given by

e(r) =

.

(36)

pr4 + q2/b2

notice that the electric eld in this case is regular every-
where. this gravitational eld asymptotically behaves as
the kottler charged solution, with the structural function
and electromagnetic eld of the form

since in our case there is no an analytical expression of r+
in terms of elementary functions, one can not give a pa-
rameter dependent expression of (34). it is easy to check
that when q = 0, t in (34) reduces to the btz tempera-
ture. in the extremal case (27), the temperature vanishes
in (34). the entropy can be trivially obtained using the
entropy formula s = 4r+ . other thermodynamic quan-
tities such as heat capacity and chemical potential can be
computed as in [20]. we recall that most of these quan-
tities in the literature are evaluated for metrics given in
terms of polynomial functions.

notice that the four dimensional einstein-born-infeld
counterpart the kottler-born-infeld black hole [18,21]
can be given by the metric (10) with
