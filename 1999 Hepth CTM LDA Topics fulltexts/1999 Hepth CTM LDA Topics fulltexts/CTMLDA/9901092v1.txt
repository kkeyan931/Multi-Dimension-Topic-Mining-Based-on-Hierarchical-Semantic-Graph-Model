abstract

we show that the decay spectrum of massive excitations in perturbative

string theories is thermal when averaged over the (many) initial degenerate

states. we rst compute the inclusive photon spectrum for open strings at the

tree level showing that a black body spectrum with the hagedorn temperature

emerges in the averaging. a similar calculation for a massive closed string

state with winding and kaluza-klein charges shows that the emitted graviton

spectrum is thermal with a grey-body factor, which approaches one near

extremality. these results uncover a simple physical meaning of the hagedorn

temperature and provide an explicit microscopic derivation of the black body

spectrum from a unitary s matrix.

i. introduction

high string excitations have a large degeneracy; the number of string states of a given

mass increases exponentially in the excitation mass measured in string units (string tension

1

or inverse string length). this degeneracy is consistent with the unitarity of the perturbative

s matrix. unitarity guarantees that the analysis of nal states that arise by the decay of a

massive state must allow to retrieve the information on how the original massive state has

been formed, i.e., on which is the coherent superposition of the many degenerate microstates

that have been formed and subsequently decayed into the nal states under analysis. a

consistent and complete way of analysing nal states is through semi-inclusive quantities,

such as spectra, two particle correlations, three particle correlations, etc. the total set of

these quantities is complete in the sense that it characterizes the initial state or, equivalently,

the coherent superposition that created the nal quantities in question. semi-inclusive

quantities are calculable in perturbative string theory (order by order in the string coupling)

with a well-dened algorithm [1], which was extensively used in the past when string theory

was being applied to strong interactions.

in this paper a remarkable property of the decay spectrum of a massive string state will
be found: when averaging over all string excitations of mass m (m 2  string tension),
the decay spectrum exactly averages to a black body spectrum with hagedorn temperature

th. that the average procedure should wash out all the information stored in spectra

and correlations leading to a total informationless thermal distribution was conjectured [2]

in order to understand recently uncovered connections between string theory and black

holes. for completeness we will briey mention in section iv the possible relevance for

black hole physics of this non-trivial property of a unitary microscopic quantum theory

generating thermal properties in a decoherence procedure. the present results also unveil

an important physical meaning of the hagedorn temperature, as the radiation temperature

of a macroscopic (averaged) string.

ii. decay rates in open string theory

the inclusive spectrum for the decay of a particular massive state |i of momentum
p = (m,~0) into a particle with momentum k (k2 = 0) is represented by the modulus

2

squared of the amplitude for the decay of |i into a state |xi  |ki, summed over all
|xi. in string theory, the initial state |i will be described by a specic excitation of the
string oscillators (for simplicity, we restrict the discussion to bosonic string theory). if nn

is the occupation number of the n-th mode (with frequency n), a state |i of mass m will
be characterized by a partition {nn} of n = pn=1 nnn, with
xn=1
n, am ] = nm,

n |{nn}i = n |{nn}i ,
m 2 = n  1,

nan  an ,

n =

(2.2)

possible partitions, thus representing the degeneracy of the level n associated with excita-
tions of mass m. the total momentum p of x will be p = p  k. at the tree level,
|xi will also be a superposition of string excitations, satisfying n |xi = n |xi,

n = p2 + 1 = n  2k0q(n  1) ,

(2.3)

let us momentarily ignore twists or non-planar eects of open string theories [3,4]. they

will be incorporated later. the inclusive photon spectrum for the decay of a state {nn} is
then given by

energy-momentum conservation, coming from the zero-mode part of the amplitude, has been

factored out from (2.4). let us dene a projector pn over states of level n as

pn = ic

the spectrum f{nn}(k) may be directly computed from (2.7) using standard operator tech-

niques or from the explicit expression (2.11), (2.12), and (we omit lorentz indices)

which follows after inverting (2.9) and noticing that v (k) is represented by the linear term

in  of w (k). for every |{nn}i, the f{nn}(k) are easily obtained and are polynomials in k.

the spectrum obtained by averaging over string states with mass m is

fn (k0) =

(2.14)

the trace in (2.15) can then be computed from (2.11) by integrating over n, n,

(2.15)

(2.16)

means the term linear in 1, 2, and then setting 1 = 2. using (2.11) we get

(2.20)

for large n, the integral in (2.20) can be computed by a saddle point approximation, with

the main contribution coming from w  1. this is similar to the familiar calculation of the
number of states nn (2.2) of level n. the behavior of f (w) at w = 1 is well known and

given by

f (w) = const. (1  w)1/2e 2

6(1w) .

(2.21)

therefore the saddle point is at ln w = a/2n. using n = n  2k0n we obtain for

large n

fn (k0) = 2 2k0n
4 = 1, since in the regime of interest, k0  m, n/n = 1 (the
emission of a photon with energy k0 of order m and higher is suppressed by a factor of order

a . thus the radiation spectrum from
a macroscopic (i.e. averaged over all degenerate microscopic states) string of mass m is

exactly thermal (despite the spectrum for each microstate being absolutely non-thermal).

the way the exact planck formula arises in the nal result is striking, since the exponents

in the numerator and denominator have dierent origins.

let us now show that the non-planar contribution does not change the above result. it

arises in open string theory due to the fact that the photon may be emitted by any of the

two ends of the string. so, strictly speaking, we should have written

6

(v (k) + v (k))|{nn}i|2

(2.25)

at the place of (2.4), where  is the twist operator [3]. the modulus squared involving v (k)

and that with v (k) leads each to half of the planar result (2.24) obtained before. the

cross product gives rise to the non-planar contribution that may be computed analogously

to the planar loop diagram, of which our spectrum represents the absorptive part. instead

of (2.15) for the non-planar contribution one has

fn (k0)n.p. =

 (pp + (v, w)) ,

(2.27)

where  is given by eq. (2.19) with v = wz

1z . the contour integral in z now selects the
pole at z = w. the remaining integral over w is dominated by the same saddle point that

allowed the evaluation of (2.20). the nal result is

fn (k0)n.p. =

2a
2n

eak0

(2.28)

which is smaller by a factor < 1/n with respect to the planar result (2.23) or (2.24) that

dominates the sum (2.25).

iii. spectrum of a charged closed string state

let us now consider closed bosonic string theory with one dimension compactied on a

circle of radius r. let m0 and w0 be the integers representing the kaluza-klein momentum

and winding number of the string state along the circle (we will assume m0, w0 > 0). the

mass spectrum is given by

7

m 2 = 4( nr  1) + q2

+ = 4( nl  1) + q2


,

(3.1)

r  w0r

where q = m0
 , consider the decay rate of a state of level nl, nr of given charges
m0, w0, with nl  nr = m0w0, by averaging over all physical states of charge m0, w0 and
level nl, nr. the calculation factorizes in a left and right part, and it is similar as in the

previous section. we assume that nr and nl are suciently large for the saddle-point

approximation to apply. the nal result is

(3.2)

(3.3)

equation (3.2) is remarkably similar to the analogous result derived for d-branes in [6]

(see also [7] ), despite the two calculations being rather dierent, and describing dierent

physical systems. indeed, the d-brane calculation involves only a single oscillator a, a that

excites modes with one unit of kaluza-klein momentum [6]; the present elementary string
calculation involves all excitations an, an, n = 1, ...,, in a very specic way dictated by
the vertex insertion.

by analogy with black holes [7], eq. (3.2) may be written as

dnrnl(k0) = const. (k0)

(3.4)

(3.5)

the radiation vanishes if the initial string state saturates the bps condition m  q+,

i.e. when m = q+. for a near bps state, m = q+, nl  nr, one gets

t = tr =

(3.6)

in the superstring theory, owing to the supersymmetry of the bps state, corrections to the

free string picture are expected to be smaller for near-bps congurations, which might

allow to extrapolate eq. (3.6) from the weak to the strong coupling regime [8].

iv. discussion

the appearance of the hagedorn temperature characterizing the radiation in the decay

of a massive macrostate in string theory at zero temperature sheds light on an old problem

concerning the physical interpretation of the hagedorn temperature. the hagedorn tem-

perature was traditionally interpreted as the temperature at which the canonical thermal

ensemble of a string gas breaks down. the technical reason is simple at higher tempera-

tures the integral dening the thermal partition function diverges and it is related to the

fast growing of the level density with mass. the question is what is the physical picture be-

hind this instability. given the present results, one can propose the following interpretation.

when an open string in a macrostate with n  1 is placed in a thermal bath of temperature
tbath < th, the string will decay by emitting massless (as well as massive) particles, as a

black body of temperature th, until the level decreases to a point where the saddle-point

prediction tstring = th ceases to apply, and the real temperature of the string is of order

tbath. a situation of equilibrium occurs immediately if one places the string in a thermal

bath with tbath = th. when tbath > th , the energy of the string increase endlessly, since it

can only emit at a xed rate determined by the temperature th. the system becomes highly

unstable, and there cannot be any thermal equilibrium. the canonical thermal ensemble

must therefore break down precisely at t = th.

string theory contains gravitation, and it is generally believed that at any nite string

coupling excitations of sucently high masses should lie within their gravitational radius

and they should therefore be black holes [9]. the gravitational eld for such string states is

so strong that a microscopic description of black holes in terms of free strings propagating in

at space-time cannot be justied. a breakthrough in understanding the connection between

9

strings and black holes has been achieved [10,6] for certain near-extremal black holes carrying

ramond-ramond charges, which have a regular horizon in the extremal limit. the loga-

rithm of the number of microstates in the weak-coupling d-brane regime exactly agrees with

the bekenstein entropy, given by the horizon area of the supergravity black hole solution.

and, remarkably, the decay spectrum of near bps branes when averaged over the many

degenerate microstates coincides with the hawking thermal spectrum of the corresponding

near-extremal black hole [6]. this suggests a smooth transition between the weak-coupling

string regime and the large coupling regime where black holes appear. or, equivalently,

it suggests that no new physics has to be invoked in order to connect a manifestly unitary

description with a regime containing black holes, where the full information about the initial

quantum state seems to be lost. in ref. [2] it was discussed how the thermal spectrum of the

weak-coupling regime should originate from the averaging that washes out the non-trivial

correlations that contain the complete information about the original microstate.

it was

also argued [2] that the aforementioned smooth transition to strong coupling implies that

single microstates (quantum states) are not black holes even if expected to be so on classi-

cal grounds. thus black hole characteristics, and even space-time geometry, must emerge

from the decoherence procedure implied by the classical limit. the cancellation through

averaging of non-trivial correlations in the perturbative regime should be at work [2] even

for chargeless strings, i.e. irrespective of having a near-bps system. this was indeed shown

here, thus substantiating the picture of [2] even for schwarzschild black holes.

finally, it would be interesting to investigate possible cosmological implications related

to the decay spectrum and lifetime of cosmic strings.
