abstract

we study the world-volume eective action of stable non-bps branes present
in type ii theories compactied on k3. in particular, by exploiting the conformal
description of these objects available in the orbifold limit, we argue that their world-
volume eective theory can be chiral. the resulting anomalies are cancelled through
the usual inow mechanism provided there are anomalous couplings, similar to those
of bps branes, to the twisted r-r elds. we also show that this result is in agreement
with the conjectured interpretation of these non-bps congurations as bps branes
wrapped on non-supersymmetric cycles of the k3.

1. introduction

in a remarkable series of papers [1, 2, 3, 4], a. sen showed that type ii string theories
contain, besides d-branes, other extended objects which are not supersymmetric. these
non-bps branes can be viewed as the bound state formed by two coincident d-branes
carrying opposite ramond-ramond charge when the world-volume tachyon is condensed
in a real kink solution. in this way, starting from two bps d(p+1)-branes, one can describe
a single non-bps p-brane. alternatively [4], it is possible to describe the same non-bps
conguration by modding out the theory by the operator (1)fl, whose eect is to change
the sign of all r-r and r-ns states. in this case, the system of a dp-brane and a dp-brane
in the type iia (iib) theory becomes a non-bps p-brane in the type iib (iia) theory1.
from this second point of view, a non-bps brane can be dened as a hyper-plane where
two dierent kinds of open strings, distinguished by a chan-paton factor, can end. the
rst sector, with c-p factor 1l, is identical to the one living on usual d-branes, whereas the
second sector, with c-p sector 1, diers from the rst one in that it contains only states
which are odd under the gso operator (1)f . due to this non-standard projection, a real
open string tachyon survives in the 1 sector, and a non-bps brane is therefore unstable
in a at type ii theory.

interestingly, it is possible to construct stable states from the above congurations by
exploiting discrete symmetries of the original type ii theory, under which the tachyonic eld
is odd. so far, two cases have been thoroughly studied: type i theory, that is essentially
type iib theory modded out by the world-sheet parity operator  [8, 9, 10]; second, type
ii theories compactied on the orbifold t 4/z2 [3, 4, 11, 12], the z2 being generated by the
reection i4 of the four compact directions or its t-dual version i4(1)fl. these stable
objects are interesting for several reasons. first, they are part of the spectra of the above
string theories, and a description which misses them would be incomplete. moreover,
despite the fact that these states do not preserve any supersymmetry, they are simple
enough to allow for a precise analysis of their physical properties, like masses or couplings.
indeed, non bps-branes are much on the same footing as usual d-branes: their exact
microscopic description is given by the conformal eld theory of the open strings ending
on them. from the closed string point of view, the properties of this conformal eld theory
can be resumed in the boundary state formalism [13], in which d-branes are described by
a coherent closed string state inserting a boundary on the string world-sheet and enforcing
on it the appropriate boundary conditions. the boundary state approach can be naturally
extended also to non-bps branes [11, 2, 10], and is often a very useful tool for describing
branes from the point of view of bulk theory.

1for the details of the dierent constructions we refer to the reviews [5, 6, 7].

1

the eective action for non-bps brane has been studied by sen in ref. [14] mainly
in at type ii context or, in the stable case, by restricting to couplings to states of the
untwisted closed string sector.

in this letter, we study additional couplings to states in the twisted sectors arising at
the xed-points where the curvature is concentrated. for convenience, we focus on the
standard i4 orbifold2, but in the t -dual case i4(1)fl one recovers similar results.
in
particular, we show that the non-bps brane action includes a wess-zumino term involving
twisted r-r states. beside the expected minimal coupling to the appropriate form, this
contains also anomalous couplings to lower forms. we will show that these couplings induce
a tree-level inow which compensates one-loop anomalies that can arise in the world-volume
theory; they are therefore crucial for the consistency of the theory. we also show that the
appearance of such anomalous couplings for these stable non-bps branes is in agreement
with their interpretation as bps branes wrapped on non-supersymmetric cycles.

2. non-bps branes in type ii on t 4/z2

in ref. [4] it was pointed out that a non-bps brane with an odd number of directions
wrapped on the orbifold t 4/i4 is a stable object in a certain region of the moduli space. let
us briey recall under what conditions the tachyonic eld disappears. consider a non-bps
(p + n)-brane with n (odd) neumann directions in the compact space (x6, x7, x8, x9). as
usual in toroidal compactication, open string states living on the brane can have kaluza-
klein modes along neumann directions (xa) and winding modes along dirichlet ones (xi).
the eective mass of these states is

ra(cid:19)2
m2 =xa (cid:18) na

+xi  wiri

2 .



(2.1)

if the radii of the compact dimensions satisfy the relations ra  2 and ri  q/2,

the only open string state which is really tachyonic is the zero-mode na = wi = 0. clearly,
this instability can not be cured by adjusting the value of the moduli in a simple toroidal
compactication, and in order to stabilize the non-bps branes the z2-projection plays a
crucial role.

let us rst recall some generalities of the d = 6 n = 2 bulk theory. in the untwisted
closed string sector, modding out i4 kills half of the original physical degrees of freedom.
one is then left with a gravitational multiplet and either 4 vector multiplets of n = (1, 1)
supersymmetry for the type iia theory and 5 tensor multiplet of n = (2, 0) supersymmetry
for the type iib theory. at each of the 16 orbifold xed-planes, there are also twisted
sectors, in which strings close up to an i4 identication. it turns out that, in this case,

2for a detailed analysis of the perturbative and the d-brane spectrum in this theory see [15].

one recovers a supersymmetric spectrum by using, also in the twisted sector, the natural
gso projection and by keeping the even states under i4 [15]. at each of the orbifold
xed-points, one gets a vector multiplet in the type iia case and a tensor multiplet in the
type iib case.

in order to discuss the low-energy world-volume theory on the previously introduced
non-bps brane, one has then to dene the z2 action on the open string states living on
it, and in particular on their c-p wave-function. the correct procedure is to impose the
conservation of the quantum numbers with respect to i4 in the interactions among open
and closed strings. in the 1l sector, the natural choice of taking the open string vacuum
as an even state under i4 turns out to be consistent. conversely, in the 1 sector, one
is forced to take the opposite choice. to see this, it is sucient to look at the two-point
amplitude between an untwisted r-r state and an open string tachyon. this is the well-
known coupling [16, 4, 17, 18] of a non-bps brane to the untwisted forms arising when

the tachyon is not constant r dt  c (p). in momentum space this gives a vertex of the
form k0
t c 1...pp+1...p+n; since c (like the brane emitting it) has an odd number of lorentz
indices in the compact space, it is odd under i4 and thus also the tachyon eld has to be
so. this means that the tachyonic zero mode is projected out and the non-bps brane is
stable when one considers the range of radii specied after eq. (2.1). thus, one can resume
the projection rules on the open string sectors by saying that the z2 operation acts also on
the c-p factor adding a minus sign to the states in the 1 sector.

from the closed string point of view these non-bps brane are described by a boundary
state containing only the untwisted part of the ns-ns sector and the twisted part of the
r-r sector [11, 8]. since the boundary state encodes the couplings of the brane with all the
states of the closed string spectrum (see e.g. [19]), we can conclude that the eective action
has to contain a dbi part, describing the couplings to ns-ns untwisted states, and a wz
part, encoding the interactions with twisted r-r states. as usual, the orbifold projection
does not change the couplings among the elds in the untwisted sector, thus one can read
this part of the action from the result obtained in at type ii theory [14] by simply setting
to zero the elds which are odd under i4. on the contrary the wz part, involving twisted
elds, has to be explicitly calculated and, as we shall see in the next section, the result
contains couplings to lower (twisted) forms which are related to an inow of anomaly. this
may seem strange, since non-bps branes contain twice as many fermions as the usual d-
branes and usually in type ii theories the two sets come with opposite chirality. however,
by analyzing carefully the eect of the z2 projection on the ramond sector, one sees that
a chiral open string spectrum may emerge.

consider rst the spacetime lling case p = 5. in this case, the ten-dimensional lorentz
group so(9, 1) is broken to so(5, 1)so(4). in the 1l sector, the standard gso-projection

3

4 -even states in the 1l sector and i 0

leads to an n = 2 gauge multiplet. in the bosonic sector, this contains one gauge boson in
the (6, 1) and 4 scalar elds in the (1, 4), corresponding to the dimensional reduction of a
gauge boson from d = 10. in the fermionic sector, there are spinors in the (4, 2)  (4, 2),
corresponding to the dimensional reduction of a chiral majorana-weyl spinor 16 from
d = 10. in the 1 sector, the non-standard gso-projection leads instead to a bosonic
tachyon and spinors in the (4, 2)  (4, 2), corresponding to the dimensional reduction of
an anti-chiral majorana-weyl spinor 16 from d = 10. finally, one has to keep only z2-
invariant states; but since the projection also depends on the c-p factor, this means that
4 -odd states in the 1 sector, where i 0
one has to keep i 0
4
is the orbital contribution to the z2 orbifold operator (without the c-p contribution). as
already discussed, the tachyon is odd under the global i4, and is therefore projected out.
moreover, the 4 of so(4) is by construction odd under i 0
4 , and using the decomposition
4 = 2  2, one concludes that if the 2 is chosen to be even under i 0
4 , then the 2 has to
be odd. the surviving spectrum is therefore found to consist of a gauge boson (6, 1) (1l
sector) and the spinors (4, 2) (1l sector) and (4, 2) (1 sector). in order to check that this
projection is correct also in the r open string sector, it is sucient to consider the 3-point
amplitude between a tachyon and two massless fermions, the rst in the 1l sector and the
second in the 1 sector. this amplitude is proportional to tr(2
1/2|0i,
and does not vanish when the rst spinor is in the (4, 2) and the second is in the (4, 2),
because the product of these representations contains the ten-dimensional scalar. this
shows that the two spinors have opposite eigenvalue under i4 and that one can not keep
both of them in the orbifolded theory. the non-supersymmetric world-volume theory is
therefore chiral.

in the cases p < 5, the six-dimensional lorentz group so(5, 1) is further broken to
so(p, 1)so(5p). the world-volume theory is obtained by simple dimensional reduction
of the world-volume theory for the p = 5 case from 6 to p + 1 dimensions.

3. anomalies

we have seen in previous section that the resulting world-volume theory is potentially
chiral. more precisely, the theory is strictly chiral only for the spacetime lling case p = 5
(non-bps 6,8-brane wrapped on 1,3 directions). for the cases p = 3 and p = 1, the world-
volume theory is obtained by dimensional reduction and is correspondingly non-chiral,
since fermions decompose into two sets of opposite chiralities. however, due to the fact
that the original fermions were chiral, these two sets of spinors transform as fermionic
representations of opposite chiralities also with respect to the group of transverse rotations
so(5  p), and a chiral asymmetry is generated when the normal bundle to the brane (in
the non-compact spacetime) is non-trivial.

4

therefore, as happens in the bps case, also non-bps branes can have an anomalous
world-volume theory, despite the fact that their string theory construction is perfectly well-
dened. this is nothing but a particular case of the well known fact that a topological
defect in a consistent quantum eld theory leads to an apparent (local) violation of charge
conservation if it supports fermionic zero modes [20]. obviously, if the starting theory is
consistent, this can not be the nal result, and actually it happens that the topological
defect develops suitable anomalous couplings to bulk elds, leading to an inow of charge
from the bulk. in other words, the world-volume one-loop anomaly is exactly canceled by
a tree-level anomaly, and charge conservation is restored [20].

the occurrence of r-r anomalous couplings for bps topological defects like d-branes
or o-planes in string theory vacua is by now well established. these couplings are com-
pletely determined through the requirement that the inow of anomaly associated to the
corresponding magnetic interactions cancel all possible world-volume anomalies [21, 22, 23]
(see also [24]). they have been also determined through direct string theory computations
[25, 26, 27, 28]. since also non-bps branes potentially support anomalies, it is natural to
expect that they will also develop anomalous couplings, and indeed we will show that they
do so. we shall follow the approach of [29], and extract the r-r anomalous by factorization
from a string theory computation of the anomaly and the inow.

the one-loop partition function on the non-bps d-brane is given by the projected

annulus vacuum amplitude

z(t) =

1
4

trrn s [(1 + i4)(1 + (1)f ) eth ] ,

(3.1)

where h is the open-string hamiltonian and the trace contains a sum over the two c-p
sectors 1l and 1. the generating functional of one-loop correlation functions of photons
and gravitons on the non-bps d-brane is obtained by integrating with the correct measure
over the modular parameter t of the annulus the above partition function, evaluated in a
0 dt (t) z(t). clearly, possible anomalies can
emerge only in the cp-odd part of this eective action, associated to the odd spin-structure,
and happen to be boundary terms in moduli space.

gauge and gravitational background:  = r 

in [29], a general method to compute directly the anomalous part of the eective action
through an explicit string computation has been presented. the gauge variation is repre-
sented by the insertion of an unphysical vertex in the amplitude, representing a photon or a
graviton with pure-gauge polarization. after formal manipulations, this unphysical vertex
combines with the world-sheet supercurrent appearing in odd spin-structure amplitudes,
to leave the t-derivative of the correlation of a certain eective vertex operator in a generic
gauge and gravitational background. interestingly, the eect of this operator was recog-

nized to correspond to obtaining the anomaly as wess-zumino descent, a = 2ir i (1), the

5

anomaly polynomial i being given by the background-twisted partition function. we use
here the standard descent notation: given a gauge-invariant polynomial i of the gauge and
gravitational curvatures f and r, one denes i (0) such that i = di (0) and i (1) through the
gauge variation i (0) = di (1).

in consistent string vacua, only the uv boundary t  0 can potentially lead to anoma-
lies, and it turns out that this vanishes by itself. at low-energy, this is interpreted as
green-schwarz mechanism, through which the quantum one-loop anomaly is cancelled by
an equal and opposite classical tree-level inow.
it was suggested in [29] that such an
interpretation can be recovered by taking the limit of slowly varying background elds,
corresponding to low momenta for external particles in the anomalous graph. in this limit,
the partition function becomes a topological index which is independent of the modulus
t, and one ends up with the extremely simple recipe that the polynomial i from which
both the anomaly and the inow descend (a (d+2)-form in d dimensions) is given simply
by this partition function, with the bosonic zero modes excluded and the convention of
working in two dimensions higher.

in our case, the anomaly polynomial is given by

i =

1
4

trr [(1 + i4)(1)f eth(f,r)] ,

(3.2)

where from now on it will be understood that one has to keep only the (d+2)-form com-
ponent, with d = p in our case. recall now that both i4 and (1)f act with opposite
signs in the two c-p sectors 1l and 1. the (1)f part gives a vanishing contribution, due
both to a cancellation between the two c-p sectors and to the four fermionic zero modes
in the compact directions, which are not twisted by the background. the i4(1)f gives
instead a non-vanishing result, since the above fermionic zero modes are absent and the
two c-p sectors give exactly the same result, generating a factor of 2. for the rest, the
computation of the partition function proceeds exactly as in [25, 23, 29]. the internal part
contributes3 a factor of 4: the n neumann bosons give a factor 2n which cancels the xed
points degeneracy 2n, whereas each of the four fermions contributes 2. setting 42 = 1,
one nds nally

i(f, r, r) = 2 ch(f ) ch(f )  ba(r)

ba(r)  e(r) .

(3.3)

here f , r and r indicate the curvature forms of the gauge, tangent and normal bundles.

ba(r) and ba(r) are the roof genera of the tangent and the normal bundles, e(r) is the

euler class of the normal bundle (dened to be 1 when the latter is null), and ch(f ) is the
chern character of the gauge bundle in the fundamental representation.

3these numbers can be obtained using -function regularization, as in [29].

6

this result gives both the one-loop anomaly on the non-bps d-brane and the opposite
inow that cancels it. the latter is related to the presence of anomalous couplings of the
non-bps d(p+n)-brane to the r-r elds in the twisted sectors arising at the 2n xed-
points contained in the n compact directions of the world-volume. the general from of
these couplings is:

s = xi

i

2 z ci  yi(f, r, r) ,

(3.4)

where i = 1, ..., 2n labels the xed-points. i is an arbitrary charge and yi(f, r, r) a
polynomial of the curvatures 4. finally, ci is the formal sum of all the twisted r-r forms
and their duals in the i-th sector. more precisely, in the relevant type iib case, one gets
one n = 2 tensor multiplet in each sector, with a r-r content of one scalar and one an
anti-self-dual 2-form5, and each ci is therefore the sum of forms of degree 0, 2 and 4. in [22],
it was shown that the inow generated by such anomalous couplings is given in modulus
by

i(f, r, r) =xi

2
i
4

yi(f, r, r)  yi(f, r, r)  e(r) .

(3.5)

comparing eq. (3.3) with eq. (3.5), one nally extracts

i = s 8

2n , yi(f, r, r) = ch(f ) vuut ba(r)
ba(r)

.

(3.6)

as expected [3, 4], in the n = 1 case the charge i with respect to each of the two ci
is identical to the twisted charge of a fractional brane at the same orbifold point. the
factorization leaves obviously an unimportant sign ambiguity in each i, that we will ignore.
we conclude therefore that the stable non-bps object obtained by wrapping a non-bps

(p+n)-brane of type iib along n-directions of t 4/z2 has the anomalous couplings

notice that, strictly speaking, the gauge bundle is restricted to have structure group
u(1) in the general construction above. to construct congurations with a u(n) bundle,
one would have to take n wrapped non-bps branes on top of each other, but unfortunately

4we use the conventions of [22], and normalize i such that yi(0) = 1.
5this can be understood in the n = 1 language of [29], where the n = 2 tensor multiplet decomposes
into a hypermultiplet containing 1 r-r and 3 ns-ns scalars, plus a tensor multiplet, containing a r-r
anti-self-dual 2-form and a ns-ns scalar.

7

such a conguration is unstable since non-bps branes repulse each other. however, it was
pointed out in [30] that when all the radii take the critical value, such force vanishes at the
leading one-loop level, due to an accidental boson-fermion degeneracy in the world-volume
theory. in this particular case, the conguration of n overlapping non-bps (p+n)-branes
becomes stable, and has indeed the anomalous coupling (3.7).

4. discussion

it is well known that the i4 orbifold describes a particular limit of a smooth k3 manifold
where 16 of the 22 2-cycles are shrinking in cone singularities which correspond to the
twisted sectors arising in the conformal analysis. the result of previous section has a
natural interpretation also from this geometrical point of view.
in fact, in ref. [4] sen
proposed that the non-bps branes considered here can be viewed as bps d-branes wrapped
on particular non-supersymmetric cycles present in the k3. this is very similar to the
interpretation of fractional d-branes at xed-points given in [31]: they can be viewed as
ten-dimensional d-branes wrapped on the exceptional cycles coming from the resolution of
orbifold singularities. more precisely, it is known that non-bps branes decay, outside the
stability region in the moduli space, into a d-brane and an anti-d-brane (i.e. with opposite
r-r untwisted charge) wrapped on two supersymmetric cycles. this implies that the two
congurations, the non-bps brane and the d-brane - anti-d-brane pair into which it can
decay, have to carry the same r-r charge.

from a geometrical point of view, where one interprets these six-dimensional branes
as ten-dimensional objects wrapped on cycles in k3, this statement means that the cycle
giving rise to the non-bps brane and the ones producing the bps branes are in the same
homology class.
in the n = 1 case, the latter are simply the two exceptional 2-cycles,
coming from the resolution of the singularities touched by the brane. interestingly, this
is enough to deduce the couplings of the non-bps brane from those of fractional branes.
indeed, the wz action of the non-bps has to come from the usual wz action of the ten-
dimensional bps-brane, reduced on the appropriated 2-cycle. fortunately, the integration
over the cycle is in this case easy: the wz part of the action contains only forms and so
the only relevant thing of the considered cycle is its homology class. using then the above
homological decomposition, one nds that the wz action for the non-bps brane is given
by the sum of the wz action of a bps brane and that of an anti-brane, wrapped on the two
exceptional cycles. these are fractional branes, and the integration over the compact space
must then give for each of these the action studied in [23, 29]6. the n = 3 case is related

6it should be possible to check through an explicit calculation that the twisted sector couplings arise by
decomposing the r-r forms on the exceptional 2-cycle, whereas the untwisted sector couplings comes from
integrating the ns-ns two-form, which is known to have a non-vanishing ux across the cycle [32, 33].

8

to the case just discussed by t-duality, and thus the general pattern is the same. the
only dierence is that the bps brane conguration in which the non-bps brane can decay
present more complicated supersymmetric 2-cycles. in both cases, summing all the wz
actions for the bps branes, the untwisted part cancels, and for the twisted part one gets
precisely the result of eq. (3.7). this provides strong evidence that both the geometrical
interpretation of [4] and the anomalous couplings derived here are correct.

as was already the case for bps d-branes, the part of the action involving r-r eld
presents some particular features: from the open string point of view the result is deter-
mined by an odd spin-structure amplitude, where only an eective zero mode part of the
various vertices is relevant for the nal result. this is related to the fact that from the eld
theory point of view, these couplings are related to possible 1-loop anomalies in the world-
volume theory. finally from the geometrical point of view, the wz term is determined
simply by the homology class of the 2-cycle dening the non-bps brane.

the dbi part of the action does not share these simplifying features and so can not be
determined directly with the above techniques. the only simple observation we can make at
this point is that there is no linear coupling to twisted elds. in absence of a gauge eld on
the brane, this is evident from the form of the boundary state written in [11, 4] which does
not present the ns-ns twisted part. the same conclusion, of course, can be derived from
an annulus calculation along the lines of [34], by focusing on the ns i4 sector. as pointed
out in ref. [30], this part gives a vanishing contribution due to a cancellation between the
two open string sectors (1l and 1). this calculation is not essentially modied by the
introduction of a gauge eld on the non-bps brane: in fact, both sectors are charged under
the relative u(1) eld and the cancellation between the two sectors still holds, showing that
no linear coupling to the ns-ns twisted scalars are produced by turning on a gauge eld7.
a possible way to go beyond this approximation is to use the geometrical interpretation of
non-bps branes and to derive not only the homology class of the 2-cycle dening them,
but also its shape. work is in progress in this direction.
