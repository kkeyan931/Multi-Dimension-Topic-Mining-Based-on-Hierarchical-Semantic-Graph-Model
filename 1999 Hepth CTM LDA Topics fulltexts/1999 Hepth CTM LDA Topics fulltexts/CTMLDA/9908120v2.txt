abstract

we investigate the supersymmetric index of n=2, 3 su(n) supersymmetric yang-mills

chern simons theories at level k by using the brane conguration with a (p, q)5-brane.

we can explain that the supersymmetry breaking occurs when k < n in terms of the

s-rule for type iib branes. the supersymmetric index coincides with the number of the

possible supersymmetric brane congurations. we also discuss a construction of a family

of theories which have the same supersymmetric index.

1 introduction

a supersymmetric index (witten index) tr(1)f is a useful criterion of dynamical super-

symmetry breaking in supersymmetric eld theories [1]. the index is given by a dierence

of the number of bosonic and fermionic zero energy states and it counts the number of
the supersymmetric vacua. when tr(1)f 6= 0 supersymmetry is not spontaneously

broken since if pairs of bosonic and fermionic zero energy states gains a non-zero energy
at least tr(1)f states remain as zero energy states. conversely, however, for the case
of tr(1)f = 0 we can not conclude whether supersymmetry is broken or not. but it

indicates a possibility of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.

the indexes for various supersymmetric theories have been computed. recently, the

index for supersymmetric gauge theory with a mass gap, which is n=1 supersymmetric

yang-mills chern-simons theory with gauge group g, is given by witten [2]. his result
shows that tr(1)f 6= 0 if |k|  h/2, where h is the dual coxeter number of g, and

suggests that dynamical symmetry breaking occurs for |k| < h/2.

three-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills chern-simons theory can be realized

on the brane conguration with a (p, q)5-brane in type iib superstring theory [3, 4, 5, 6].

for n=1 supersymmetric theory without any extra matters, the corresponding brane

conguration has not been well understood. but n=2, 3 supersymmetric theories are easy

to handle by the branes. the moduli space of vacua of n=2, 3 theory can be explained

by the brane conguration [4]. so we focus only n=2, 3 theory throughout the present

paper.

in this paper, we extend the wittens computation of the index to n=2, 3 su(n) super

yang-mills chern-simons theory at level k and show that this index is well interpreted

by using the type iib brane conguration. especially, the dynamical supersymmetry

breaking in some region of k is explained by the so-called s-rule (supersymmetric rule)

for the branes. moreover, when the index is non-zero we show that the index exactly

coincides of the number of possible supersymmetric brane congurations.

the organization of this paper is as follows.

in section 2, we briey review a mi-

croscopic computation of the index by witten. the computation can straightforwardly

extend to n=2, 3 extend supersymmetry. we will give the formulae of the indexes. in

section 3, we explain about the s-rule for the branes and generalize it to the stretched

d3-branes between two dierent types of (p, q)5-branes. we next show in section 4 that if

1

this generalized s-rule is applied to the n=2, 3 yang-mills chern-simons brane congura-

tion, the conguration for k < n can not keep the s-rule, that is, the conguration is not

supersymmetric. these results are consistent with the computation of the index. we will

give the exact formula of the index by counting the number of possible supersymmetric

conguration from m-theoretical point of view. we also discuss the relation between a

supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the computation of the index in terms of the

branes. in the subsequent subsection, we construct a family of theories which have the

same index by using some brane dynamics. finally, section 5 is devoted to a summary of

our results and discussions of further problems.

2 brief review of the microscopic computation of the

index

we rst consider n=1 su(n) supersymmetric yang-mills chern-simons theory on rt 2.

the computation is done by a born-oppenheimer approximation. in this approximation

we take a small volume limit of the torus.
if g and r denote the gauge coupling and
the radius of the torus, the mass of the vector multiplet kg2 is much smaller than the

kaluza-klein mass of order 1/r. we will consider the quantizing of the zero energy
states, whose energy are of order kg2 by means of the approximation.

now let us consider the moduli space of a at g-connection on t 2, which is a zero

energy classical gauge eld conguration. the moduli space m of at g-connections on
t 2 is given by

m = (u  u)/w,

(2.1)

where u is the maximal torus of g and w is the weyl group. for g = su(n), m
becomes simply the complex projective space cpn1 [7].

we next consider zero modes for the gluino elds of positive and negative chirality
+ and +, which have at most energy of order kg2. we assume the zero modes of 
take of the form:

rxa=1

2

where the t a, a = 1, . . . , r are a basis of the lie algebra of u and a

 are fermionic

 =

a
t a,

(2.2)

constants, which obey the following canonical anti-commutation relations

{a

+, b

} = ab,

{+, +} = {, } = 0.

(2.3)

the + and  can be regarded as creation and annihilation operators, so we now introduce
ground states annihilated by the a


these two states are related each other by

|i = 0.

|+i =

a
+|i.

rya=1

(2.4)

(2.5)

the anti-commutation relations (2.3) can be regarded as the cliord algebra on m.

therefore, the hilbert space made by quantizing the fermion zero modes maps to the

space of spinor elds on m. since m is a complex manifold, the spinor eld on m is
simply represented by the form with values in k 1/2, where k is the canonical line bundle

of m. so if we consider a general state in the fermionic space

    aq
a1

 |+i,

(2.6)

this is regarded as the (0, q)-form on m with values in k 1/2. more precisely speaking,
the forms on m take values not only in k 1/2 but also in a line bundle w, since |+i is

regarded as a (0, 0)-form on m with values in w.

to determine the line bundle w let us consider the canonical quantization of the

yang-mills chern-simons theory. the momentum conjugate to aa

i is given by

is a connection on the line bundle w. the connection form k
j means that the line
bundle over m is lk, where l is the basic line bundle. the supercharges of the theory

(2.11)

therefore, the supercharges q+ and q can be identied with the  and  operators,
which is a decomposition of a dirac operator acting on spinors valued in w = lk.

since these two operators obey

{ , } = h,

2 = ( )2 = 0,

(2.12)

where h is the hamiltonian, the space of supersymmetric ground states is given by the

cohomology

n1mi=0

h i(cid:0)m, w  k 1/2(cid:1) .

for g = su(n), m  cpn1. the basic line bundle over m is l = o(1) and the
canonical bundle of m is k = ln. therefore, the above cohomology groups are rewritten

as

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

where we use w = lk. thus, the supersymmetric index is

(2.17)

where for the case of k  n/2 we use serre duality

h n1(cpn1, lr)  h 0(cpn1, lnr)

for r  n.

(2.18)

we now extend this computation of the index to the case of n=2, 3 supersymmetric

yang-mills chern-simons theory in three-dimensions. first, we note that the n=2 vector

multiplet consists of one spin 1 vector boson a, two spin 1/2 spinors 1, 2 and one spin
0 real adjoint scalar x. since the adjoint scalar has the mass kg2, the coulomb branch

of this theory is completely lifted. therefore, the presence of the adjoint scalar does not

aect the index. so, the computation of the index is modied by two gluino elds as

in =2(k) =

=

n1xi=0
n1xi=0

(1)i dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, w  k 1/2  k 1/2(cid:1)
(1)i dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, lkn(cid:1) .

(2.19)

similarly, for the n=3 theory, the massive vector multiplet contains one spin 1 vector

boson a, three spin 1/2 spinors 1, 2, 3, three spin 0 real adjoint scalars x1, x2, x3
and one spin -1/2 spinor . in this case, there is also no coulomb branch moduli. the

gluino elds contain one opposite spin eld, so the contribution of one of spin 1/2 elds

is canceled by the spin -1/2 eld .

in =3(k) =

=

n1xi=0
n1xi=0

(1)i dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, w  k 3/2  k 1/2(cid:1)
(1)i dim h i(cid:0)cpn1, lkn(cid:1)

(2.20)

therefore, the index of n=3 theory coincides with the n=2 one. we can again obtain

the index of the n=2, 3 theories by the serres formula.

in =2,3(k) =( 0
(cid:0) k1
kn(cid:1) =(cid:0) k1

n1(cid:1) for kn

for 0<k<n

.

(2.21)

for k  0 we also compute the index by using the serre duality, which is non-zero valued

for any n, but the eld theoretical meaning of this duality has not been understood at

the present. so, we assume that k is a positive integer in the following. we will discuss

the relation between the index and the brane conguration in the following section.

5

3 the s-rule for type iib branes

in this section, we explain about the s-rule for branes in string theory. the s-rule is a

phenomenological rule of brane dynamics, which is rst proposed by hanany and witten

[9], and is needed in order to make supersymmetric congurations. for example, a ns5-

brane and a d5-brane, which are completely twisted in the conguration space, can be

supersymmetrically connected by only one d3-brane. if we use this rule we can nd the

exact correspondence between the brane conguration and the supersymmetric vacua of

eld theories. some explanations on this rule are given from various point of view in

refs. [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. if we map the d3-brane between the ns5-brane and the d5-

brane to an m2-brane between two m5-branes by u-duality, we obtain the following rule

in m-theory:

a conguration in which two completely twisted m5-brane are connected by more than

one m2-brane is not supersymmetric.

we can obtain all of other supersymmetric brane congurations keeping the srule

in various string theory from this m-theoretical rule by string duality. so we now con-

sider the generalization of the s-rule for the d3-branes between two dierent type of the

(p, q)5-brane. the (p, q)5-brane in type iib theory is described by a single m5-brane

which wrapping simultaneously on two cycles of the compactied torus of m-theory. the

wrapping number of the each cycles corresponds to charges of the (p, q)5-brane. this

wrapping cycle is denoted by p + q, where  and  stand for the two independent
cycles of the torus. if we introduce another (p, q)5-brane the corresponding m5-brane
similarly wraps on a p + q cycle. the m5-brane and the m5-brane meet |pq  qp|
times on the torus, where |pq  qp| is an intersection number of cycles p + q and
p + q. since only one m2-brane can be attached on each intersecting point if we use

the above s-rule in m-theory, the maximal number of the m2-branes between m5- and
m5-brane must be |pq  qp| to preserve supersymmetry. if the number of m2-branes is
more than |pq  qp|, we can not arrange the m2-branes in a supersymmetric way.

by using string duality, the m5- and m5-brane maps to the (p, q)5- and (p, q)5-brane

in type iib theory. so we nd that if the number of the d3-branes between the (p, q)5-
and (p, q)5-brane is more than |pq  qp| then the conguration is not supersymmetric.1

1if pq

  qp

 is negative, it means that the stretched d3-branes are anti-d3-branes which have opposite

orientation and charge.

4 comparison with supersymmetric yang-mills chern-

simons theory conguration

in this section, we apply the result of the previous section to the brane conguration of

supersymmetric yang-mills chern-simons theory and compare with the computation of

the index. n=2, 3 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills chern-simons theories at level k

are realized on the generalized hanany-witten type congurations, in which n d3-branes

are suspended between an ns5-brane and a (p, q)5-brane [3]. the coecient of the chern-

simons term, that is, the level of chern-simons theory is given by k = p/q in this brane

setup. for non-abelian gauge theory this coecient should be an integer due to the

quantization condition. so, we set p = k and q = 1 in the pages that follow to avoid

subtlety.

moreover, in order to compare with the result of the index computation, we only

consider theories without any extra matter except for vector multiplet. for n=2 yang-
mills chern-simons theory, the conguration is2

4.1 supersymmetric index from branes

we rst apply the generalized s-rule to the type iib brane conguration which describes

su(n) yang-mills chern-simons theory at level k.

in this conguration one of the 5-

brane is an ns5-brane, namely, a (0, 1)5-brane. another is a (k, 1)5-brane. these 5-

branes are completely twisted in the n=2 and n=3 conguration (4.1) and (4.2). so,

the supersymmetric conguration is restricted by the s-rule. the intersection number of

these 5-branes in m-theory is k. therefore, for supersymmetry, the maximal number of

the d3-branes must be k.

2for derivation and notation, see ref. [3].

7

therefore, we nd that the conguration is supersymmetric if n  k and the situation

for n > k violates the s-rule and spontaneously breaks supersymmetry. this exactly agree

with the computation of the index, that is, in =2,3(k) 6= 0 for n  k and in =2,3(k) = 0 for
n > k.

we next consider how the value of the index itself is described in the brane congura-

tion. the value of the index means the number of the possible supersymmetric vacua. so,

we can expect that the non-zero value of the index coincides with the number of possible

supersymmetric congurations of branes.

in order to count the number of supersymmetric conguration, we again lift the type

iib conguration to m-theory. the ns5-brane is an m5-brane wrapping on a cycle 

and the (k, 1)5-brane is an m5-brane wrapping on a cycle k +  in m-theory. these

m5-branes intersect k times on the torus. therefore the m2-brane can be attached on k

intersecting points, but can not be attached on the same point by the s-rule. if n > k,

the n m2-branes can not be arranged without violating the s-rule. so, supersymmetry is

broken. for n  k the number of possible supersymmetric congurations coincides with

the number of choices of n points within k points, that is,(cid:0) k
n(cid:1).

this number seems not to be the same with the index (2.21). however, precisely

speaking, the gauge group g on the n d3-branes, which we are considering, is u(n)

rather than su(n). since the computation of the index in section 2 is for g = su(n),

this discrepancy occurs. to compare with the index for su(n) gauge theory, we must

x one of positions of the m2-brane, which corresponds to a phase of overall u(1) factor

of u(n).

if we x the position of one m2-brane, residual ways of the supersymmetric

arrangement of m2-branes is(cid:0) k1

n1(cid:1). this number exactly agrees with the index (2.21).

a similar derivation of the supersymmetric index by counting possible supersymmetric

congurations is discussed in the case of the m-theory description of n=1 supersymmetric

yang-mills theory in ref. [15].

as discussed in ref. [3], the positions of m2-branes correspond to vevs of the wilson
line operator w2 along the x2-direction. in the supersymmetric conguration, all of m2-

brane positions are dierent. so, we nd that the vevs of the wilson line operator must

take the following form

hw2i = diag(cid:0)e2im1/k, e2im2/k, . . . , e2imn/k(cid:1) ,

(4.3)

up to over all phase, where mi are dierent positive integers which satisfy 0  m1 <
m2 <    < mn < k. therefore, we can conclude that in the supersymmetric phase, gauge

symmetry of n=2, 3 u(n) yang-mills chern-simons theory is broken to u(1)n by the vev
of the wilson line operator. (for g = su(n), broken to u(1)n1.)

4.2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the brane

let us next consider a dual description of the above type iib brane conguration which

describes supersymmetric yang-mills chern-simons theory. that picture make easy to

learn about the connection to the computation of the index.

we rst consider a maxwell chern-simons theory for simplicity. the corresponding

brane conguration is that a single d3-brane is suspended between a ns5-brane and a

(k, 1)5-brane.

if we consider the long wavelength limit of the maxwell chern-simons

lagrangian, in which we drop all spatial derivatives, we obtain

l =

(4.4)

where the gauge coupling g is give by the sting coupling gs and the dierence between two
5-branes l as 1/g2 = l/gs. this lagrangian has exactly the same form as the lagrangian
for a non-relativistic charged particle with mass 1/g2 moving in the plane in the presence

of a external magnetic ux k perpendicular to the plane. therefore, the maxwell chern-

simons system has the same canonical structure with the landau problem.

on the other hand, if we take t-dual along the x1- and x2-direction and s-dual in

(4.5)

where kd3  d5 is a bound state of k d3-branes and a d5-brane. on the d3-d5 bound

state, k d3-branes are regarded as k magnetic ux on the d5-brane. therefore, on the d3-

d5 bound state the end of the fundamental string stretched from the d5-brane looks like

a charged particle in the k magnetic ux. (see fig. 2.) since the gauge eld conguration

ai maps to the position of the fundamental string xi by t-duality, we obtain really the
(supersymmetric) quantum mechanical lagrangian of the landau problem for the position
of the string on (x1, x2)-plane after using t-duality and s-duality

mass which is string tension times length l in magnetic ux which is proportional to k

. this is a lagrangian for the particle with

ij xixj,

(4.6)

if we now extend the above situation to su(n) gauge theory, n becomes the number

of particles. due to the su(n) restriction the sum of the particle positions must vanish.

the moduli space of the n-tuple of such the particle positions on the torus is known as
a copy of complex projective space cpn1 [7], which is a phase space of the quantum
mechanical system (4.6).

after all, analysis of the vacuum structure of supersymmetric yang-mills chern-

simons theory replaces the quantization of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics on

the d3-d5 bound state by using u-duality. this is the same thing with the microscopic

computation of the index in section 2. the covariant derivative (2.9) and the supercharges

(2.11) and (2.11) can be regarded as operators acting on the supersymmetric quantum

mechanics of the landau problem.

finally, we comment on a non-commutative nature on the torus. in limit of l  ls,
2 ij xixj. this is rst order in time derivatives, so

the lagrangian (4.6) becomes l = ek

the two coordinates x1 and x2 are canonically conjugate to one another, that is,

thus, the coordinates of the ends of open strings are non-commutative. we can under-

stand this property as the non-commutative torus by turning on a non-zero b-eld back-

ground using a gauge transformation [16, 17]. this non-commutative nature is closely

related to the dynamics of chern-simons theory.

4.3 duality and mirror relations

in this subsection we present a family of theories with a chern-simons term, which have
the same supersymmetric index. we rst consider an exchange of 5-branes in the x6-
direction. when two dierent types of twisted 5-branes cross in the x6-coordinate and

exchange positions, some d3-branes are annihilated or created by the hanany-witten

transition [9]. for example, if n d3-branes are stretched between the ns5-brane and the

(k, 1)5-brane (n < k), then the number of stretched d3-branes becomes kn after the

transition.

this phenomenon is also simply explained from the m-theoretical point of view [3]. in

m-theory, the hanany-witten transition is creation or annihilation of a single m2-brane

between two twisted m5-branes, which can not avoid each other in the conguration space.

in the case of n < k, m2-branes can be attached on the n dierent positions within the k

allowed positions on the m5-brane. after exchanging the positions of the two m5-branes
in the x6-coordinate, n m2-branes are disappeared and new m2-branes are created on

kn opening positions.

thus, we nd that by the hanany-witten transition the gauge group of n=2, 3 su-

11

(if
persymmetric u(n) yang-mills chern-simons theory at level k becomes u(kn).
g = su(n), then g = su(kn+1) since we must x one of the m2-branes.) on this
transition the number of the possible supersymmetric conguration, namely, the index,

n(cid:1) =(cid:0) k
kn(cid:1).

has not been changed because of the equivalence of the combination(cid:0) k

another operation to the brane conguration is s-duality in type iib theory. if we

apply the s-duality to the brane conguration which describes supersymmetric yang-mills

chern-simons theory at level k, we have a self-dual model at level 1/k as a worldvolume

eective theory [3]. since this s-dual transforation can be understood as just a coordinate
ip of x2 and x10 in m-theory, there is no dierence between the congurations of the

yang-mills chern-simons theory and self-dual model themselves. so, we expect that these

theories have the same supersymmetric index.

in this way, we can construct the family of theories with the same index by using

the operations in superstring theory. for n=2, 3 supersymmetric theories, u(n) and

u(kn) yang-mills chern-simons theory at level k and u(n) and u(kn) valued self-

dual models at level 1/k have all the common supersymmetric index. it suggests that

these theories are related each other by duality and mirror symmetry of three-dimensional

supersymmetric eld theory.

5 conclusion and discussions

we have investigated in this paper the relation between the supersymmetric index of

three-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills chern-simons theory and the brane con-

guration in type iib superstring theory. we have found that when the index is non-zero

valued, the corresponding brane conguration is supersymmetric. conversely, when the

index vanishes, the conguration violates the s-rule and becomes non-supersymmetric. in

addition, we have found that the number of the possible supersymmetric conguration

exactly coincides with the value of the index. these results are considered as an expla-

nation of the s-rule for the brane dynamics from the point of view of the worldvolume

eective theory.

the computation of the index can be generalized to other gauge groups g of rank

r [2]. the moduli space m of the at g-connection is a weighted projective space
wcpr
s0,s1,...,sr, where the weights si are 1 and the coecients of the highest coroot of
i=0 si = h. the supersymmetric condition is also generalized by using

g and obey pr

this dual coxeter number h. the corresponding brane conguration is probably con-

structed by adding orientifold planes as like as supersymmetric yang-mills theory with

orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups [18, 19, 20]. it would be interesting to nd the

correspondence between the index and the more general s-rule including the orientifold

planes.

the original computation of the index is for n=1 yang-mills chern-simons theory,

which is chiral. it is generally hard to construct the chiral theory on the branes. moreover,

the chern-simons coecient of n=1 supersymmetric theory is renormalized and shifted
by sgn(k) h
2 [21]. this renormalization is closely related to the derivation of the index.
however, we have not understood the meaning of the renormalization of the coecient in

terms of the branes in superstring theory. we hope that we can also analyze the dynamics

of lower supersymmetric theory by using branes.

the construction of the dual or mirror theory in terms of the brane dynamics is simple

as mentioned. however, eld theoretical meanings of these symmetries have not been so

clear. it is interesting to extend the analysis of ref. [22] to the non-abelian case. we hope

that the brane congurations in superstring theory help to understand non-perturbative

dynamics of supersymmetric quantum eld theories in three-dimensions.

note added

as i completed this paper, i received ref. [23], which also considers supersymmetry break-

ing in n=3 yang-mills chern-simons theory and its n=2, 1 deformations in a similar

manner using branes.
