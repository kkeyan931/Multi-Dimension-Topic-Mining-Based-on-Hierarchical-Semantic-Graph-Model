d0-branes moving in a constant antisymmetric c eld are found to be described by

quantum mechanics of the supersymmetric matrix model with a similarity transformation.

sometimes this similarity transformation is singular or ill-dened and cannot be ignored.

as an example, when there are non-vanishing cij components, we obtain the theory

for dp-branes which is eectively the noncommutative super yang-mills theory. we also

briey discuss the eects of other non-vanishing components such as c+ij and cijk.

1. introduction

a background independent, nonperturbative m/string theory remains one of the em-

inent problems in this ambitious program. there exists a conjectured formulation of non-

perturbative m theory in a at background, in the innite momentum frame [1]. this

formulation makes heavy use of intuitions from the d0-brane physics. as a rst step to-

ward generalizing this formulation to a background independent one, one may consider

d0-branes on a curved background. however, it turns out that d0-brane physics in this

case resists a general understanding.

when none of the maximal supersymmetry is broken, such as compactications on

tori of dimensions less than 6, the problem is not so dicult [2]. in a somewhat seemingly

simpler situation where there is a general background of constant bosonic elds, a for-

mulation has not been proposed. one naturally divides bosonic elds into two sets. the

rst consists of constant metric. this problem is more or less trivial, since with a linear
coordinates transformation, the metric can be put into the standard minkowski form 1.

the second set consists of constant antisymmetric tensor eld c. in the presence of an

interesting physical system which the generalized matrix theory is supposed to describe,

one cannot always gauge away this constant background. in the case when only cij are
nonvanishing, and xi, xj etc. are compactied, there exists a proposal by connes, douglas

and schwarz [3]. in this proposal, one replaces the super yang-mills on the torus by the

noncommutative super yang-mills (ncsym), with the noncommutative moduli given by

ij = rcij, where r is the radius of the longitudinal circle. this proposal was later jus-

tied by considerations in string theory [4,5,6], where the kind of sen-seibergs argument

[7] in the decoupling limit is employed.

in sec.2 we will start from the membrane action with the coupling to the c eld,

and discretize it to obtain the d0-brane hamiltonian. the resulting quantum mechanics

diers from the standard one only by a similarity transformation. but this transformation

may be singular or ill-dened in various situations. two such circumstances are discussed.

in particular, when one considers compactication or orbifolding, dierent matrix models

may result. as an example, in sec.3 we will derive the ncym for a brane solution directly

using this transformation. we will show that the connes-douglas-schwarz proposal can

be directly derived in a perturbation expansion of the matrix theory without resorting to

1 from a background independent perspective, however, this is not a satisfactory solution,

since one always has to put the constant metric as parameters into the hamiltonian.

1

sen-seibergs argument, or to quantizing open strings at all. we also show in sec.4 how

our similarity transformation can be related to the map of seiberg and witten [6] between

the noncommutative elds and the commutative ones. our approach is so general as to

enable us to discuss the eects of turning on other c eld components such as cijk, c+ij,

c+i in sec.5.

much remains to be done to unravel the physical eects of switching on other compo-

nents of the constant c eld, in dierent situations. the simplest is the eect of cij on

d0-branes. our discussion in the next section indicates that there are eects even without

compactication. if matrix theory is correct, we expect that the spectrum of threshold

bound states of d0-branes is not changed. the rst thing in mind is then to calculate the

witten index again for the system of n d0-branes.

2. a similarity transformation

the hamiltonian of multiple d0-branes can be derived by starting with the membrane
action in the light-cone gauge, and replacing all physical variables, say x i(1, 2), by
matrices x i = {x i

mn}. here we briey review this procedure, leaving details to the
in the light-cone gauge, x + is identied with time  , and x 

original literature [8].

becomes an auxiliary eld satisfying the constraints

ax  + d x iax i + fermionic terms = 0,

(2.1)

where a = a and d =  + {a0, } and the poisson bracket {a, b} = abaabb is
dened with respect to the pair {1, 2}. we will concentrate on the bosonic variables,

since introduction of fermionic variables is straightforward. the hamiltonian is written as

h = z d2(cid:18) p +

2

(d x i)2 +

1

4p + {x i, x j}2(cid:19) .

(2.2)

to get to the d0-brane hamiltonian, we replace p + by n/r, the poisson bracket {, } by
n

i [, ] (1/n is treated as the planck constant), and the integral r d2 by 1

hamiltonian thus obtained reads

n tr. the d0-brane

h = tr(cid:18) 1

2r

(d x i)2 

r
4

[x i, x j]2(cid:19) .

(2.3)

2

we believe that the above procedure generalizes to the case when there is a constant

c eld. the coupling of the membrane to the c eld is

s1 =

1

6 z cdx   dx   dx ,

(2.4)

and is a total derivative when all the components of c are constant. thus equations of

motion as well as constraints derived from the new action are the same as before. however,

one cannot ignore this total derivative term at the quantum mechanical level. for instance,

if we are to compute the quantum propagation of membrane from a time t1 to another
time t2, the propagator is given by the path integral

h(t2)|(t1)i = z [dx]ei(s0+s1),

(2.5)

where s0 is the membrane action without the c eld. now since s1 is a total derivative,
it can be written as two boundary terms at time t1 and t2:

s1 =

1

6 (cid:18)z d2cx {x , x }(t2) z d2cx {x , x }(t1)(cid:19) .

(2.6)

the interpretation of the two boundary terms in the path integral is straightforward:
they simply renormalize the initial and nal wave functions. the new wave function 
then becomes

 = u ,

with

u = exp(cid:18) i

6 z d2cx {x , x }(cid:19) .

for d0-branes, this unitary operator u is

u = exp(cid:18) 1

6

ctrx [x , x ](cid:19) .

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

notice that if x  is involved in u , we should employ the constraints (2.1), thus the
operator will contain the canonical momenta p i, and an ordering in the exponential in

(2.9) must be chosen. we shall discuss this in the next section.

the equivalent of renormalizing the wave functions is to perform a similarity trans-

formation on operators and to keep all wave functions intact. given the operator o, the
new operator is u ou . if the similarity transformation operator u behaves in a reasonable

way, the new theory obtained is identical to the original one. however, if the similarity

3

transformation is singular, the new theory can be really a dierent theory. to see that our

similarity transformation is sometimes singular, we consider two cases separately.

the 1st case:

we rst consider the case in which no x  is involved. the exponential in u is cubic

in x. a simpler example of this type is a single particle with a single coordinate. for

example, if

u = exp(iatx2),

then a time-independent wave function will become time-dependent after this transfor-

mation, or equivalently, the hamiltonian will become time-dependent in the heisenberg

picture. on the other hand, if

u = exp(iax3),

then there is no eect at all.

for the case in which x  is involved, as we shall see in the next section, the exponential
in u will take roughly the form x 3p . again consider the simpler case of a single particle

with

u = exp(cid:18)(cid:18) a

n  1(cid:19) xnx(cid:19)

for n > 1. this operator is just exp(ay), where y = x(n1). we start with a wave
function (y), and demand it be normalizable and vanish at x = . thus (y = 0) = 0.

the transformed wave function is u (y) = (y + a).

its value at x =  no longer

vanishes, instead it is (a). apparently this new wave function is no longer normalizable.

these examples are quite similar to the case of a charged particle on a circle when a

constant gauge eld is turned on. in this case the new wave function is not periodic any

more, if the original one is. similarly, the above demonstrations show that the boundary

conditions for wave functions are changed under the action of u .

although it would be very interesting to investigate further such situations, in this

paper we will only elaborate on the following situation.

the 2nd case:

another situation in which the physics is changed by a similarity transformation is

when there are further constraints which reduce the physical hilbert space to a smaller

space on which the unitary operator is no longer well dened.

in the next section we

will show that the noncommutativity of d-brane worldvolume due to constant b eld

4

background can be understood in this way. before we examine the d-brane case, let us

consider a toy model as a warm-up.

consider a matrix model of 2  2 matrices xi and a unitary transformation of the ma-

trix model by the operator u = exp (itr(pi pi)), where  is a constant hermitian matrix
and pi is the conjugate momentum matrix of xi. obviously this unitary transformation
produces a shift  to all the matrices xi: (xi)ab  xi = (xi)ab + ab and doesnt change
the commutation relations among the matrix elements (xi)ab, a, b = 1, 2. now suppose we
are interested in the commutative limit and impose the constraints (xi)12 = (xi)21 = 0.
the resulting xi satises [xi, xj] = 0 and can be viewed as a function on an ordinary
commutative space consisting of two points. obviously the constraint kills some degree
of freedoms of x i and the similarity transformation is no longer well dened in the con-

strained matrix model. however one can also perform the similarity transformation rst

and then impose the constraint, this way we obtain a new matrix model dierent from
the original one, since [ xi, xj] is now nonvanishing for generic .
we will see that the constraints eecting matrix model compactication is quite similar

in the next section,

in nature to the simple constraint we considered here. it is therefore important to rst

perform the similarity transformation and then impose the compactication constraints.

this simple example illustrates the same key reason why the similarity transformation

(2.9) for cij 6= 0 results in the noncommutativity on a d-brane.

it should be clear from this example that this consideration can be applied to orbifolds

as well as compactications.

3. noncommutative yang-mills from similarity transformation

when the only non-vanishing components are cij , we expect that a brane solution
in matrix theory is described by the ncsym, if all indices i, j . . . are tangent to the brane.
similarly, if x i,j are compactied, the ncsym also emerges. the two cases dier only in

the yang-mills coupling, whose correct value can be obtained by treating the operation tr

properly in each case. thus, we shall not distinguish explicitly between the two.

before going over to d0-branes, the u operator (2.8) can be rewritten as

u = exp(cid:18)

i

2 z d2cij{x , x i}x j(cid:19) .

(3.1)

using the constraints (2.1),

{x , x i} = d x k{x k, x i},

5

u = exp(i),

i =

1
4

ijtr(cid:2)[x i, x k], x j(cid:3)+ p k,

(3.3)

we now replace the poisson bracket by a commutator, the integral by trace, so the u

operator for d0-branes is

u = exp(cid:18) 1

4

cijtr(cid:2)[x k, x i], x j(cid:3)+ d x k(cid:19) ,

(3.2)

where [, ]+ is the anti-commutator and we have judiciously chosen an ordering in the
trace. identifying the conjugate momenta p  = 1
r d x , we have the nal form of the
operator as

where ij = rcij. if we take the fermion part of constraints (2.1) into account, u will
contain a part involving fermionic elds.

everything we said so far is classical. when we quantize the system, it is natural
2 (f (x)p + p f (x)) =
x f and the i thus obtained will be dierent by an additional term of ib :=
in fact, in order for u to be a unitary operator, it is necessary to use

to adopt the weyl ordering prescription to have: f (x)p  1
f (x)p  i 
i
4 ijtr[x i, x j].
the weyl ordering. however, ib can be nonvanishing only in the large n limit and is
proportional to the conserved membrane charge. it doesnt modify the operator o at all

and only modies the wavefunction by a phase. so long as we consider states with the

same membrane charge, these terms have no observable eects and hence we will drop

them from now on and use (3.3) as our denition. but they cannot always be omitted if

we consider membrane processes with charge transfer.

the eect of adding the cij eld background in the matrix model is to replace every

operator o by

o = u ou.

with the anticipation that on compactication xj will be replaced by idj = ij + aj,
we will split x into x j = x j
0 corresponding to some constant background
conguration that will be identied with ij after compactication. i is splitted corre-
spondingly into i = i0 + i1, with

one can separate the full operator u into two parts

u = u1u0 with u0 = ei0 ,

6

(3.4)

(3.5)

and u1 = ei1 (1 + o(2)). the omitted higher order terms o(2) are terms that can
arise in u as i0 and i1 dont commute. the main reason for this separation (3.5) with the

action of u0 singled out explicitly is that, roughly speaking, with x0j identied with ij,

u0 will result in the star product and u1 will relate the noncommutative u (1) elds to the

commutative ones.

decompose o into

o = u 
0

ou0,

o = u 

1 ou1.

(3.6)

let us rst consider only the eect of u0 and ignore u1. this can be viewed as the 0th
order calculation in a perturbative expansion in terms of x 
1 . denoting the matrix x  by
 and using p = i 

x  , we nd

(3.7)

now consider a solution representing a single dual dp-brane whose longitudinal di-

rections coincide with those along which ij is non-vanishing. we use i to denote these
directions. the directions transverse to the brane will be denoted by x a, x b. for the
longitudinal directions, x i is replaced by idi = i(i  iai) with ai being the u (1) gauge

eld and tr shall be replaced by r d. 2 let x i

0 = ii, then

0 u0 = (i +

thus we obtain a function whose arguments are i = i + i

2 ijj and they no longer

commute among themselves. it is

[i, j] = iij .

(3.9)

2 for convenience, we will consider only u (1) gauge symmetry on the d-brane world volume

in the following, and its generalization to the u (n ) case is straightforward.

7

in terms of the dual b-eld on the dp-brane worldvolume,  = b
1+b2 . these are exactly
the commutation relations obtained by quantizing open strings on a d-brane. here we

want to emphasize again that nowhere we have resorted to string theory.

note that our denition of the new function () through () is schematically

() = x 1

n!

n()()n,

(3.10)

where  =    and is a derivative. on rst sight, this denition seems to be dierent

from the usual weyl ordering for a function of noncommutative variables, which is

(i) = z dk (k)eiki i .

(3.11)

as is well-known, the latter denition obeys the star product. our denition is instead

(i) = z dk (k)eikiie 1

2 kiij j .

(3.12)

but since eaeb = ea+b for a, b commuting, the two denitions are in fact identical.
therefore

f ()g() = (f  g)()

for any functions f, g of xas and ais with the star product dened by

(f  g)() = e

i
2 ij



i





j f ()g()| = .

(3.13)

(3.14)

it is now natural to interpret this as dening the noncommutative algebra of functions over

a noncommutative space. it is satisfying to see that the star product in noncommutative

gauge theory has a simple origin from matrix model.

it is convenient to introduce a left (resp.

right) translational invariant vacuum

denoted by i (resp. h) which is annihilated by all derivatives i acting from the left (resp.
right). so for instance

()i = ()i.

(3.15)

as a notation consistent with stokes theorem, integration on the noncommutative space
can be denoted as the vacuum expectation value hi: 3

hf ()i = z dpf (),

3 this notation is very natural in noncommutative geometry for the following reason. in the
quantum mechanics for a single particle, a state can be denoted in terms of its wave function
as (x)i, and momentum acts on the state according to the algebraic rules [p, x] = i and
pi = 0. the inner product of two states i(x)i, denoted by h
1 (x)2(x)i, is just the integration
of 

1 (x)2(x).

8

where r dp  is the ordinary integration on a classical space, and it should agree with the

large n limit of the trace tr.

here a puzzle arises. consider two elds 1() and 2() originally commuting with
each other. after the similarity transformation, 1 and 2 do not commute, while by
naively applying (3.6), one gets [ 1, 2] = u 
0 [1, 2]u0 = 0. the reason why this naive
procedure is not correct is as follows. when turning the matrices 1 2 into functions

of i, we have killed (innitely) many degrees of freedom since the two original large n

matrices are not commuting in general. for instance one can rst compactify the space on
t p by imposing constraints like

v 
i xjvi = xj + 2ijrj,

v 
i xavi = xa,

(3.16)

and then let rj   in the end, if one wishes. the similarity transformation is ill-dened

after the constraints are imposed. this is just what happens in the warm-up example

in sec.2. instead, if we perform the similarity transformation rst and then impose the

constraints for compactication (as we were doing here in this section), we get the non-

commutativity on the d-brane.

in the above we have given discussions in the hamiltonian formulation. the hamilto-

nian in the temporal gauge a0 = 0 after the similarity transformation becomes that of the

noncommutative u(1) gauge theory. if we want to recover the eld a0, for consistency, it

must be a noncommutative variable too. therefore the resulting action for the dp-brane

is obtained from the d0-brane lagrangian

l = tr(cid:18) 1

2

(d0x )2 

1
4

[x , x ]2(cid:19)

(3.17)

by replacing x by x, usual product by star product and tr() by hi. thus we obtain the

well known ncym lagrangian.

4. relation to seiberg-witten map

in the previous section we have only showed the eect of conjugation by u0 on opera-

tors, and ncym is obtained as the 0th order approximation of the exact matrix theory in

cij background. now we consider the eect of conjugation by u1 and examine the new
elds ai and x a.

9

before we start, we mention that it is straightforward to repeat the idea of [6] to derive

the relation between the noncommutative scalars and the usual scalars. together with the

result for the noncommutative u (1) gauge eld, it is

x sw

a = x sw

2

k (lasw

i + f sw
li )

(4.1)

(4.2)

up to rst order in  for the gauge group u (1).

for the action of u0, the result (3.8) for a dp-brane solution is exact to all orders in

. to the rst order in , the transformation by u1 is given by

xa = u 

1 xau1 = xa 

1

(4.3)

xi = u 

1 xiu1 = i[i 

1
4

kl[(iak), l]+] + [ai 

1
2

klakfli] +    .

(4.4)

ideally, the eect of u1 should result in the relations (4.1) , (4.2) of seiberg and witten
which map the commutative elds to the noncommutative ones. to the lowest order in ,
we should identify our elds x and a with seiberg and wittens noncommutative u (1)
elds x sw and asw, because they are multiplied with one another using the star product.
however, (4.3) and (4.4) are not exactly the same as the seiberg-witten map, so we can
not just identify our x and a with their commutative u (1) elds x sw and asw. to the

rst order in , the unwanted piece (the second term in the rst []) in (4.4) can be absorbed

in a change of coordinates. let

(4.5)

(4.6)

this operator  is chosen such that it is anti-hermitian and satises [
[

j] = 0 (up to rst order in ). 4 at the same time,

i, 

i, 

j] = ij and

ai() = ai( +

a) = ai() +

kl(kai)al +    ,

4 compared with the usual denition of derivatives after a change of coordinates   ,
4 klikal. this term can be accounted for by the change of

(4.6) diers by the additional term 1
integration measure due to the jacobian 

 .

10

and similarly for xa, giving exactly the extra pieces we were missing from the seiberg-

witten map in (4.3) and (4.4). finally, we obtain

xa = xa(), with

xa() = xa()  klaklxa +    ,

(4.7)

ai = ai(), with

ai() = ai() 

1
2

klak(lai + fli) +    ,

(4.8)

where  =  + i
2 . these equations are exactly of the same form as the seiberg-
witten map, thus x, a can be identied with the noncommutative u (1) elds x sw, asw
in the seiberg-witten map and x, a with the commutative u (1) elds. to be exact, the

separation of u into u0 and u1 should be adjusted order by order in  in order to reproduce
the seiberg-witten map.

it is obviously more complicated to implement this kind of derivation to higher orders

in , and one expects to meet ambiguities if all we need is a map between the noncom-

mutative and commutative variables which preserves gauge transformations [9]. on the

other hand, it is also easy to see that in principle the results at the rst order in  can be

extended to all orders by solving a particular dierential equation with respect to . from
x = u xu and u = exp(ijj ij), where jij = 1

4 tr[[x i, x], x j]+p, one derives

 x = ij[j ij, x]

(4.9)

for a variation ij  ij. this is just the rst order term in  in the expansion of x in
terms of x, with all xs replaced by x. note that the derivation is valid only if ij is
varied by scaling. for a dierent path of variation of , the result is in general dierent [9].

note also that (4.9) is only analogous to the dierential equation in [6]; they are dierent

by a change of variables.

note that we will not be able to perform the the change of coordinates (4.5) for the

case of u (n ) because that requires the coordinates  to turn into a matrix. the best one

can do is to take the u (1) part of a for this change of coordinates. on the other hand,

one should wonder why should one use a single set of coordinates for all the n d-branes,

while the background values of b + f can be dierent on each d-brane. for the cases

in which the expectation values of b + f change signicantly from brane to brane, one

expects that with only a single set of coordinates satisfying [ i, j] = iij , ncym will not

be able to give a good description of the system for any choice of . it is just because

our formulation gives the exact result, and the most general background of b + f can be

any u (n ) matrix, that we are led to a situation where it seems natural to introduce a

11

matrix of coordinates. a dierent consideration that seems to lead to the same conclusion

is to start from a suitable theory of matrix open string and consider a sector of the theory

which describes n coincident d-branes. analogous to the situation in [5], it seems natrual

that the d-brane worldvolume will emerge as u (n ) matrices with noncommutating matrix

elements. we leave this possibility for further studies.

it would also be interesting to relate our results to recent discussion on a relation

between noncommutative variables and commutative variables [10].

5. other components of the c field

in this section we consider the eects of other components of c. let us consider cijk
rst. in this case the unitary operator u is simply a function of x i, so the xs are not

modied by conjugation by u , but their conjugate momenta are changed. it is easy to see

that if the directions labeled by i, j, k are compactied, cijk will change the spectrum as:

pi  pi 

i
2

cijk[xj, xk].

(5.1)

it appears that without compactication, the above similarity transformation does

not change physics, this is easy to see by applying the transformation to the hilbert

space, rather than to operators. an alternative argument is that cijk are not moduli in 11

dimensions. with compactication, the story can change. if one dimension is compactied
rst, the matrix string results. let this dimension be x1, then c1ij = bij. it is well-known
in string theory that on a torus, bij becomes a genuine moduli, this implies that to get

nontrivial physics we need to compactify two more dimensions. we conclude that on
t 3 parametrized by (xi, xj, xj), cijk does have physical eects. this is compatible with
eq.(5.1). upon compactication, the second term is proportional to cijkfjk. the zero

modes of fij will shift the canonical momentum pi. if this shift is not quantized (a vector

on the momentum lattice), then there is a net physical eect.

the case of c+ij 6= 0 is a little more interesting. since in the light-cone gauge

x + = p + = (n/r) , we have

u = exp(cid:18)

1
2r

c+ij n tr[x i, x j](cid:19) .

(5.2)

is simply the membrane charge and is a conserved quantity. the operator (5.2) simply

shifts the energy by a quantity proportional to the membrane charges.

if c+i 6= 0, both x and p will be modied by the similarity transformation by a
time-dependent piece. if we compactify xi, its momentum is quantized and the physical
eect of c+i is manifested in the momentum spectrum, in a way similar to the eect of
a wilson line. but here the shift in spectrum is time-dependent. it may be interesting to

study in more details these cases.

6. discussions

we expect that our construction will shed light on the problem of working out the

complete seiberg-witten map. it seems that serious progress in examining the ads/cft

correspondence in a b eld background can be made only after the seiberg-witten map is

well understood. in general, one needs to nd a general way to construct local and gauge

invariant operators. we leave this problem to future investigation.

the method of studying eects of c eld in matrix theory can be readily generalized

to the iib matrix model [11]. there one starts with the schild action s0 for a fundamental
string. to include the b eld, one adds a term to the schild action

s = s0 +z bij{x i, x j}d2.

upon discretizing the world sheet, the second term becomes

ibijtr[x i, x j].

(6.1)

(6.2)

to investigate the physical eects of this new term, one may focus attention on a d-brane

solution.

it was already pointed out in [12] that a d-string and in general a d-brane

solution naturally introduces the ncsym as the eective world-volume theory. it would

be interesting to study this issue further by combining the term (6.2) with the ordinary

iib matrix action.

come back to matrix theory. it is rather surprising to us that introducing a constant

c background is implemented by a similarity transformation, although this is imposed on

us by the chern-simons term in the membrane action. one may ask the deeper question

in light of our observation: how does a constant background emerges from a would-be

background independent formulation? in the past, adding background inevitably intro-

duces new degrees of freedom, this certainly is not in line with the idea of a background

13

independent formalism. a background should emerge as a collective solution of the exis-

tent degrees of freedom. our work seems to be a step further in this direction. we still

put in the background by hand, but by merely reshuing the old degrees of freedom

through a similarity transformation, instead of introducing new ones.
