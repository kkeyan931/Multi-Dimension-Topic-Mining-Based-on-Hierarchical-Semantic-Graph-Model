(4) massless scalar elds ads/cft correspondence one assumes eld (x0 , xi ), = 1, ..., n adsn+1 boundary value 0( xi ) x0 0 . 2we follow closely notation denitions petersen . 3alternatively, coordinates boundary could dened n-dimensional minkowski space. 4 object coupled eld ( xi ), representing cft boundary. correlation functions ( xi ) eld calculated generator z  = h expz dnx 0( xi ) o( xi ) . (5) integral dened boundary en. mapping spaces realized associating generator cft correlation functions boundary shell value classical action adsn+1. one introduces action governs dynamics inside adsn+1 space standard klein gordon action curved space-time: i1 = 1 2 z dn+1xg . (6) variation action i1 change eld small amount formally i1 = z dn+1x (g ) + z dn+1x  = z dn+1x g ( ) + z dnx g (0 ) . (7) however, metric also eld derivative, see next section, singular x0 = 0. thus need prescription order well dened meaning expressions. consider last integral (7) calculated near boundary, x0 = . moreover, variations elds bulk subject condition |x0= = 0 . (8) condition mean reaches limiting value 0 x0 = rather varying eld conguration x0 < respect classical solution. assuming conditions hold, last integral (7) vanishes thus action stationary respect variations eld euler lagrange equation motion satised: = 1 g (cid:16)g(cid:17) = 0 . (9) eld (x0 , ~x) inside adsn+1 space related eld boundary calculating greens function represents evolution eld 5 initial value x0 = 0 values inside adsn+1. following  one nds (x0 , ~x ) = c z dnx (x0)n ((x0)2 + (~x ~x )2 )n 0(~x) . action i1, eq.

(10) (11) so, considering shell value action, last term vanishes equation motion whereas rst one leads surface term. using green function solution (10) write action i = cn 2 z dnx dnx 0(~x)0(~x) (~x ~x )2n (12) generates appropriate two point functions operators o(~x) bound- ary: (13) ho(~x)o(~x)i 1 (~x ~x )2n . 3 partially integrated scalar field action let us see previous discussion ads/cft modied instead action i1, eq. (6), decide consider action i2  = 1 2 z dn+1xg . (14) euler lagrange equation motion associated action also given = 0, eq. (9), i. e., corresponding action (6). standard eld theory case, one usually assumes space boundary, actions would describe dynamics. however, let us see happens repeat procedure described previous section order nd generator correlation functions action i2. consid- ering solution elds adsn+1 terms boundary values would green function given eq. (10), since equation motion elds described i2 previous action i1 action rewrite i2  = 1 2 z dn+1x (cid:16)(x0)n+1 (cid:17) , (15) 6 vanishes shell. would nd vanishing generator correlation functions use action, analogously fermionic case discussed introduction. let us interpret result light ideas reference  appropriately using variational principle take account eects presence boundary. fermionic case complete solutions elds well dened values boundary ads . thing happen scalar case, assume eld well dened value 0 boundary, least massless case. however dierence action i2, eq. (14), respect previously considered action i1, eq. (6), concerning variational principle. point action i2 involves second order eld derivatives. eld theories whose dynamics governed classical action involving rst order eld derivatives, variational principle states considering eld congurations xed values (of eld itself) space time border, action minimized one satises euler lagrange equation. however, one considers eld theories involving higher order eld derivatives one needs general x also derivatives elds border . let us see variation action i2 make small variation eld : i2 = z dn+1x + z dnx . 1 2 z dnx (16) so, action would stationary if, besides satisfying equation motion, could make also ( 0 ) vanish boundary. would correspond look solutions well dened values eld also time derivative boundary. assuming eld well dened non vanishing boundary value, let us look derivative . considering eld adsn+1 space given green function, eq. (10), calculate 0 : 0 (x0 , ~x ) = nc x0 z dnx 2nc z dnx (x0)n ((x0)2 + (~x ~x )2 )n 0(~x) ((x0)2 + (~x ~x )2 )n+1 0(~x) .

(16), possible consider surface integrals dened x0 = assume condition |x0= = 0, eq. (8), hold. dealing classical objects would objection adding (8) extra condition (0)|x0= = 0 . (19) case usual prescription variational principle including derivatives elds second order  would satised thus action i2 would minimized solutions euler lagrange equations. however, inserting equation motion action i2 would nd vanishing boundary term contribution. action would lead vanishing correlators ads/cft correspondence. point considering classical action approximation quantum action. thus eld time derivative 0 taken quantum operators corresponding canonical pair non commuting variables. impose 0 vanish time, would violate uncertainty principle. xing limiting value eld, assume condition (0 ) = 0 hold boundary last term equation (16) non vanishing. therefore action i2, eq. (14), minimized congurations satisfy equation motion = 0, eq. (9), long consider eld derivative quantum operators. one decides, fermionic case , add action i2 surface term compensates variation action one would nd appropriate one m = 1 2 z dn+1xg (cid:16) (cid:17) . (20) gives trivially i2 + = i1 showing analysis variational principle indicates indeed action i1 appropriate one calculating eld correlators boundary ads/cft correspondence. 8 interesting mention alternatively, one could imposed deriva- tive 0 well dened boundary price eld 0 would xed, one would still nd non vanishing boundary terms. alternative case correspond neumann boundary conditions. even possible discuss gen- eralized boundary condition condition imposed linear combination 0 0. calculations ads greens functions two cases discussed recently minces rivelles {$9907079$}. now, let us see presence mass would change conclusions. introduce mass term im  = 1 2 z dn+1x m22 , (21) actions i1, eq.

(23) now, two point correlation functions operators o(~x) conformal dimen- sion = n + + boundary given by: ho(~x)o(~x)i 1 (~x ~x )2n+2+ . (24) mass term involve eld derivatives, extra surface term i2 . previous discussion variational principle remains action i2 ruled impossibility xing time 0 (up scale factor) boundary. 9 4 conclusions seen idea reference  using minimum action principle criterion selecting classical action describe mapping ads space conformal theory boundary also works properly scalar eld case. contrast fermionic case, eld completely xed boundary. however, partially integrated actions involving second order eld derivative would minimized one requires additional condition xing eld derivative boundary. condition possible canonically conjugate quantum elds. variational principle, together quantum ingredient uncertainty principle rules lagrangians would lead vanishing correlation functions. acknowledgments authors partially supported cnpq, finep fujb - brazilian research agencies. appendix integrand rst term (17) behaves n-dimensional delta function times 0(~x) implies behavior like (1/x0)(x0, ~x). second term behav- ior limit x0 0, although may transparent expression. clue this, let us recall representation one-dimensional delta function (x) = 1 lim y0 x2 + y2 (25) consider (up constant) product rational functions xi variables x0 (x0)2 + (x1)2 x0 (x0)2 + (x2)2 x0 (x0)2 + (xn)2 (x0)n = (x0)2n + (x0)2(n1)(cid:16) (x1)2 + (x2)2 + . . . + (xn)2(cid:17) + . . . .
