brst invariant formulation of spontaneously broken

gauge theory in generalized dierential geometry

department of physics, boston university, boston, ma 02215

abstract

noncommutative geometry(ncg) on the discrete space successfully reproduces the higgs mecha-
nism of the spontaneously broken gauge theory, in which the higgs boson eld is regarded as a kind
of gauge eld on the discrete space. we could construct the generalized dierential geometry(gdg)
on the discrete space m4  zn which is very close to ncg in case of m4  z2 and m4  z3. gdg is
a direct generalization of the dierential geometry on the ordinary manifold into the discrete one. in
this paper, we attempt to construct the brst invariant formulation of spontaneously broken gauge
theory based on gdg and obtain the brst invariant lagrangian with the thooft-feynman gauge
xing term.

introduction

the standard model in particle physics has matched with all experimental data conducted so far. only
ingredient which remains undetermined is the higgs boson eld that causes the spontaneous breakdown
of symmetry through its vacuum expectation value. the next targets of future accelerators such as lhc
and tevatron ii are to detect the higgs boson and supersymmetric partners of particles and to nd the
breakthrough out of the standard model. thus, the great concerns about the higgs boson eld have been
kept also from now.

let us put emphasis on its similarity with the gauge boson as one of the characteristic features of the
higgs boson in the standard model. regardless to say, the higgs boson eld is a boson eld as the gauge
eld though it is scalar eld. in addition, the higgs eld has the same type coupling with fermions as
the gauge elds and it has trilinear and quartic self-couplings as well as weak gauge elds. from these
similarity between the higgs and gauge bosons, an idea that the higgs boson may be a kind of gauge
boson comes out. in fact, as models to realize this idea, there has been proposed the kaluza-klein model
[1], and noncommutative geometry(ncg) [2], [4] on the discrete space. especially, ncg approach does
not require any extra physical mode and realizes the unied picture of gauge and higgs elds as the
generalized connection on the discrete space m4  z2.
since the rst formulation of ncg by connes [2], many versions of ncg [4]-[6] has appeared and
succeeded to reconstruct the spontaneously broken gauge theories. morita and the present author [6]
proposed the generalized dierential geometry (gdg) on the discrete space m4  z2 and reconstructed
the weinberg-salam model. in this formulation on m4  z2 the extra dierential one-form  is intro-
duced in addition to the usual one-form dx and so our formalism is the generalization of the ordinary
dierential geometry on the compact manifold. this formulation was generalized to gdg on the discrete
space m4  zn [9], [11] by introducing the extra one-forms k(k = 1, 2  n ), which generalization en-
abled us to reconstruct the left-right symmetric gauge theory[11], su(5) gut[9] and so(10) gut[10] as
spontaneously broken gauge theories on the discrete space m4  zn .

it is also very important to reconstruct the gauge xing and ghost terms in ncg in order to ensure
the quantization of gauge theory. lee, hwang and neeman [12] succeeded in incorporating these terms
in ncg in the matrix derivative approach based on the super-connection formalism[7]. they obtained
the brs/anti-brs transformation rules of the theory by applying the horizontality condition[8] in the
super-connection formalism and constructed brst invariant lagrangian including the gauge xing and
ghost terms. the present author subsequently applied their idea to the gdg formulation of gauge theory
on m4  z2 [13] and obtained the brst invariant formulation. we apply in this article the similar
method to more general formulation of gdg on m4  zn [16] based on our formulation of gdg. the
last section is devoted to concluding remarks.

2 brst transformation in generalized dierential geometry

the generalized dierential geometry (gdg) on m4  zn was formulated [9], [11] to reconstruct the
gauge invariant lagrangian of the spontaneously broken gauge theories such as the standard model,
the left-right symmetric gauge theory and su(5) and so(10) grand unied theories.
in this section,
we incorporate brst transformation in gdg according to the super eld formalism of bonora and
tonin[14]. this formulation[13] has already done in gdg on the discrete space m4  z2. here, we
generalize it to m4  zn where x and n(n = 1, 2  n ) are arguments in m4 and zn , respectively.
let us start with the equation of the generalized gauge eld a(x, n, , ) written in one-form on the
discrete space m4  zn :
(2.1)

i (x, n, , )dai(x, n, , )
a

a(x, n, , ) =xi

by adding the grassmann numbers  and  to x and n to produce the ghost and anti-ghost elds. the
constituent ai(x, n, , ) is the square-matrix-valued function with a subscript i which is a variable of
the extra internal space. now, we simply regard ai(x, n, , ) as the more fundamental eld to construct
gauge and higgs elds because it has only mathematical meaning and never appears in nal stage. the
operator d in eq.(2.1) is the generalized exterior derivative dened as follows.

d = d +

dk + d + d,

n

xk=1

dai(x, n, , ) = ai(x, n, , )dx,
dk ai(x, n, , ) = [ai(x, n, , )mnk + mnkai(x, k, , )]k,
dai(x, n, , ) = ai(x, n, , )d
d ai(x, n, , ) =  ai(x, n, , )d,

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)
(2.6)

where dx is ordinary one-form basis, taken to be dimensionless, in minkowski space m4, and k is the
one-form basis, assumed to be also dimensionless, in the discrete space zn . d, d  are also one-form base
in super-space. we have introduced x-independent matrix mnk whose hermitian conjugation is given
by m 
nk = mkn. the matrix m (y) turns out to determine the scale and pattern of the spontaneous
breakdown of the gauge symmetry. thus, the symmetry breaking mechanism is encoded in the d =
k=1 dk operation. in order to nd the explicit forms of gauge, higgs elds and ghost elds according

pn
to eqs. (2.1) and (2.2)(2.6), we need the following important algebraic rule of gdg.

kf (x, n, , ) = f (x, k, , )k,

(2.7)

where f (x, n, , ) is a eld dened on the discrete space such as ai(x, n, , ), gauge eld, higgs eld
, ghosts or fermion elds. it should be noticed that eq.(2.7) never expresses the relation between the
matrix elements of f (x, n, , ) and f (x, k, , ) but insures the product between the elds expressed in
dierential form on the discrete space. equation(2.7) realizes the non-commutativity of our algebra in the

2

geometry on the discrete space m4  zn . inserting eq.(2.2)eq.(2.6) into eq.(2.1) and using eq.(2.7),
a(x, n, , ) is rewritten as

a(x, n, , ) = a(x, n, , )dx +

n

xk=1

where

nk(x, , )k + c(x, n, , )d + c(x, n, , )d,

(2.8)

i (x, n, , )ai(x, n, , ),
a

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

a(x, n, , ) =xi
nk(x, , ) =xi
c(x, n, , ) =xi
c(x, n, , ) =xi

i (x, n, , ) (ai(x, k, , )mnk + mnkai(x, k, , )),
a
i (x, n, , )ai(x, n, , )
a

i (x, n, , ) ai(x, n, , ).
a

a(x, n, , ), nk(x, , ), c(x, n, , ) and c(x, n, , ) are identied with the gauge eld in the avor
symmetry, higgs eld, ghost and anti-ghost elds, respectively. in order to identify a(x, n, , ) with
true gauge elds, the following conditions have to be imposed.

i (x, n, , )ai(x, n, , ) = 1,
a

(2.14)

xi

where 1 in the right hand side is a unit matrix in the corresponding internal space. this equation is very
important often used in later calculations and may suggest that the variable i might be an argument in
the internal space because the denition of gauge eld in eq.(2.9) is very similar to that in berry phase
[3]. if we dene the operator k as

the higgs eld nk(x, , ) is written as

kai(x, n) = ai(x, n)mnk + mnkai(x, k)

nk(x, , ) =xi

a
i (x, n)kai(x, n),

(2.15)

(2.16)

which is the same form as the ordinary gauge eld a(x, n, , ) in eq.(2.9). for later convenience, we
dene the following one-form elds as

a(x, n, , ) = a(x, n, , )dx,
nk(x, , ) = nk(x, , )k,
c(x, n, , ) = c(x, n, , )d,
c(x, n, , ), = c(x, n, , )d.

before constructing the gauge covariant eld strength, we address the gauge transformation

of ai(x, y, , ) which is dened as

i (x, n, , ) = ai(x, n, , )g(x, n),
ag

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

where g(x, n) is the gauge function with respect to the corresponding avor unitary group. then, we can
nd from eqs.(2.1) and (2.21) the gauge transformation of a(x, n, , ) to be

ag(x, n, , ) = g1(x, n)a(x, n, , )g(x, n) + g1(x, n)dg(x, n),

(2.22)

3

where as in eq.(2.2)eq.(2.4),

dg(x, n) = (d +

n

xk=1

dnk )g(x, n) = g(x, n)dx +

n

xk=1

kg(x, n)k

(2.23)

using eqs. (2.21)and (2.22), we can nd the gauge transformations of gauge, higgs, ghost and anti-ghost
elds as

(x, n, , ) = g1(x, n)a(x, n, , )g(x, n) + g1(x, n)g(x, n),
ag
nk(x, , ) = g1(x, n)nk(x, , )g(x, k) + g1(x, n)kg(x, n),
g
c g(x, n, , ) = g1(x, y)c(x, n, , )g(x, n),
c g(x, n, , ) = g1(x, n) c(x, n, , )g(x, n),

(2.24)

(2.25)
(2.26)

(2.27)

equation(2.25) is very similar to eq.(2.24) that is the gauge transformation of the genuine gauge eld
a(x, n, , ) and so it strongly indicates that the higgs eld is a kind of gauge eld on the discrete space
m4  zn . from eq.(2.23), eq.(2.25) is rewritten as

nk(x, , ) + mnk = g1(x, n)(nk(x, , ) + mnk)g(x, k),
g

(2.28)

which makes obvious that

(2.29)
is un-shifted higgs eld whereas nk(x, , ) denotes shifted one with the vanishing vacuum expectation
value. equations (2.26) and (2.27) show that ghost and anti-ghost elds are transformed as the adjoint
representation.

hnk(x, , ) = nk(x, , ) + mnk

in addition to the algebraic rules in eq.(2.2)(2.6) we add one more important rule that

dl (mnkk) = (mnll)  (mnkk) = mnlmlkl  k,

(2.30)

and in addition, whenever the dk operation jumps over mnll, a minus sign is attached. for example,

dk (mnlla(x, n)) = (dk mnll) a(x, n)  mnll  (dk a(x, n)) .

(2.31)

generalized exterior derivative d under the natural conditions that

which together with eq.(2.4) yields the nilpotency of d = pn
dx  d = d  dx,

dx  k = k  dx,
k  d = d  k
d  d = d  d,

k  d = d  k
  =  .

k=1 dk and then the nilpotency of the

dx  d = d  dx,

(2.32)

it should be noted that k  l is independent of l  k so that k  l 6= l  k. this independence is
due to the noncommutative property of our generalized dierential geometry. for the proof of nilpotency
of d, see [11]. with these considerations we can construct the gauge covariant eld strength:

f (x, n, , ) = da(x, n, , ) + a(x, n, , )  a(x, n, , )

(2.33)

from eqs.(2.22) and (2.23) we can easily nd the gauge transformation of f (x, n, , ) as

f g(x, n, , ) = g1(x, n)f (x, n, , )g(x, n).

(2.34)
here, according to bonora and tonin[14] we impose the horizontality condition [8] on f (x, n, , )
(2.35)

f (x, n, , )|= =0 = f (x, n),

that

4

where f (x, n) is the generalized eld strength not accompanying one-form base d and d. equation(2.35)
yields the conditions that

d a(x, n) + d c(x, n) + a(x, n)  c(x, n) + c(x, n)  a(x, n) = 0,
a(x, n) + d c(x, n) + a(x, n)  c(x, n) + c(x, n)  a(x, n) = 0,
d 
c(x, n) + nk(x)  c(x, n) + c(x, n)  nk(x) = 0,
d nk(x) + dk
c(x, n) + nk(x)  c(x, n) + c(x, n)  nk(x) = 0,
nk(x) + d
d 
d c(x, n) + c(x, n)  c(x, n) = 0, ,
c(x, n) + c(x, n)  c(x, n) = 0, ,
d 
c(x, n) + d
d 

c(x, n) + c(x, n)  c(x, n) + c(x, n)  c(x, n) = 0,

(2.36)

(2.37)

(2.38)

(2.39)

(2.40)

(2.41)

(2.42)

which determine the brst/anti-brst transformations of each eld together with the denitions that

(2.43)
it should be noticed that nilpotencies of d and d  are consistent with eqs.(2.36)(2.43) and for example,
d c(x, n) = d c(x, n) = c(x, n)d  d because  and c(x, n) are grassmann numbers. thus,

c(x, n) =  b(x, n).
d 

c(x, n) =  b(x, n),

d

 c(x, n) = b(x, n),

 c(x, n) = b(x, n).

(2.44)

(2.45)

(2.46)

from eqs.(2.36) and (2.37), the brst/anti-brst transformations of a(x, n) follows as

a(x, n) = dc(x, n) = c(x, n) + [a(x, n), c(x, n)],
 a(x, n) = d c(x, n) =  c(x, n) + [a(x, n), c(x, n)].

from eq.(2.18)eq.(2.20), the brst/anti-brst transformation of the higgs eld are rewritten as

nk(x) = kc(x, n) + nk(x)c(x, k)  c(x, n)nk(x),
 nk(x) = k c(x, n) + nk(x) c(x, k)  c(x, n)nk(x),

which by use of hnk(x) = nk(x) + mnk lead to

hnk(x) = hnk(x)c(x, k)  c(x, n)hnk(x),
 hnk(x) = hnk(x) c(x, k)  c(x, n)hnk(x).

(2.47)
(2.48)

(2.49)
(2.50)

equations (2.49) and (2.50) are the usual brst/anti-brst transformation of the higgs eld. from
eqs.(2.40) and (2.41), the brst and anti-brst transformations of ghost and anti-ghost elds are ob-
tained, respectively.

c(x, n) = c(x, n)c(x, n),
c(x, n) =  c(x, n) c(x, n),
 

and from eq.(2.42), the restriction about nakanishi-lautrup eld follows as

b(x, n) + b(x, n) = c(x, n) c(x, n)  c(x, n)c(x, n).

with these equations, we can proceed to obtain the brst invariant lagrangian of gauge theory.

brst invariant yang-mills-higgs lagrangian is obtained by

where gn is a constant relating to the coupling constant of the avor gauge eld and tr denotes the
trace over internal symmetry matrices. in order to express yang-mills-higgs lagrangian let us denote
the explicit expressions of the eld strength f (x, n). the algebraic rules dened in eqs.(2.2)(2.4), (2.7)
and (2.14) yield

f (x, n) =

where

f (x, n) = a(x, n)  a(x, n) + [a(x, n), a(x, n)],
dnk(x) = nk(x) + a(x, n)(mnk + nk(x))

vnk(x) = (nk(x) + mnk)(kn(x) + mkn)  ynk(x)

for k 6= n,

(nk(x) + mnk)a(x, k),

which may be independent or dependent of nk(x) and/or may be a constant eld.

in order to get the explicit expression of lymh in eq.(2.54) we have to determine the metric structure

of one-forms.

< dx, dx >= g,
< k, l >= kl,

g = diag(1,1,1,1),

< d, d >=< d, d >= 1,

(2.61)

with the vanishing values of other combinations. from eqs.(2.56)(2.59), the rst term of eq.(2.54) that

where the third term in the right hand side of eq.(2.62) is the potential term of higgs particle. the second
and third terms of eq.(2.54) give the ghost term lgh and the gauge xing term lgf, respectively. the
calculation of the second term in eq.(2.54) proceeds as

because a(x, n, , ), c(x, n, , ) and c(x, n, , ) are anti-hermite and nk(x, , ) = kn(x, , )
together with the internal product < k, l >= kl. it should be noted that

(cid:8)c(x, n, , )c(x, n, , )(cid:9) = 0,
 (cid:8) c(x, n, , ) c(x, n, , )(cid:9) = 0,

due to the nilpotency of brst/anti-brst transformation. then, according to the brst/anti-brst
transformations in eqs.(2.45)(2.53), lgh is expressed as

(kb(x, n)) = nb(x, k)

(dkc(x, n)) = dnc(x, k)

(2.71)
because of b(x, n) = b(x, n), c(x, n) = c(x, n) and c(x, n) =  c(x, n), we easily nd the her-
miticity of eqs.(2.66) and (2.70).
in next two sections, two special models, su(2) higgs-kibble gauge model and the standard model

are reconstructed according to the general framework in this section.

3 application to su(2) higgs-kibble gauge model

in this section we apply the previous results to the spontaneously broken su(2) gauge model. we need
the discrete space m4  z2(n = 2) to reproduce the higgs mechanism in the su(2) higgs kibble model.
let us rst assign the elds on discrete space m4  z2 to the physical elds. for gauge elds,

a(x, 1) =

a(x,) = 0,

where ai

m12 = m

 0 (cid:19) ,

(3.2)

where m12 must be chosen to give the correct symmetry breakdown. for ghost and anti-ghost elds
which correspond with gauge elds in eq.(3.1) we take

because  c i = ibi and  c0 = ib0. we can take the gauge transformation functions as

g(x, 2) = 1.

(3.8)

on account of eq.(2.14)

with these considerations, we can obtain lymh, lgh and lgf in eqs.(2.62), (2.66) and (2.70), respec-

tively. after the denition of the higgs doublet h =(cid:18) +

4 application to the standard model

the reconstruction of the standard model in gdg was completely performed in [16] by adopting the
discrete space m4  z2 on which the fermion elds are represented as vectors in 24 dimensional internal
space including weak isospin, hypercharge, color and generation indices. corresponding to this fermion
representation, gauge elds, higgs boson, ghost elds, nakanishi-lautrup elds are expressed in 24  24
matrix forms as generators in 24-dimensional space. here, we omit the color gauge eld because it does
not bring any signicant dierence from our results.

the higgs eld is assigned in the same way as in eq.(3.2) by making it a 24  24 matrix. the symmetry

the auxiliary eld y (x, n)(n = 1, 2) becomes unit matrix because of the assignments of mnk in eq.(3.2).
with these considerations, we can obtain lymh, lgh and lgf in eqs.(2.62), (2.66) and (2.70), respectively.

the ghost elds become massive and the new interaction terms between ghosts and higgs elds appear.
it should be noted that lgh coincides with that in eq.(3.16) in the limit of g = 0 except for u(1) ghost

5 concluding remarks

the reconstructions of the spontaneously broken gauge theories based on the generalized dierential
geometry on the discrete space m4  zn have consistently performed so far. especially, the standard
model is nicely reconstructed in gdg on m4  z2 [16] by introducing the 24-dimensional internal space
where chiral fermions are represented as 24-dimensional vectors. it is well understood that the higgs
boson eld is a connection on the discrete space zn and an unied picture of the ordinary gauge elds
and higgs boson eld as the generalized connection is realized. this is a common feature of the ncg
approach.

in this paper, brst invariant formulation of the spontaneously broken gauge theory is presented in
our scheme of a gdg on the discrete space m4  zn . according to the super space formulation by
bonora and tonin[14], we introduce the grassmann numbers  and  as the arguments in super space
in addition to x in m4 and n in zn . the horizontality condition [8] on the generalized eld strength
f (x, n, , ) determines the brst transformation of every eld including the higgs boson eld. by use of
the generalized gauge eld a(x, n, , ) and the nakanishi-lautrup eld b(x, n, , ), the gauge xing and
ghost terms are dened in eq.(2.54) and written explicitly in eqs.(2.66) and (2.70). two applications to
the su(2) higgs-kibble model and the standard model show ghost elds to be massive and bring the new
interaction terms between ghosts and higgs elds. this is natural because the higgs boson is a member
of the generalized gauge eld in gdg on the discrete space in the same way as ordinary gauge elds.
especially, our brst formulation prefers the thooft-feynman gauge [15] as the gauge xing condition,
so in this case  = 1 is required.

the higgs mechanism necessary for the spontaneously broken gauge theory is well understood in the
generalized dierential geometry on the discrete space. in addition, the super space formalism by bonora
and tonin[14] is nicely incorporated in this formulation to bring the brst invariant lagrangian. it is
possible to discuss the anomaly of the spontaneously broken gauge theory in the present formulation as a
future work. it is also an important purpose to incorporate the supersymmetry in the present formulation.
if it would be possible, this approach would be more promising.
