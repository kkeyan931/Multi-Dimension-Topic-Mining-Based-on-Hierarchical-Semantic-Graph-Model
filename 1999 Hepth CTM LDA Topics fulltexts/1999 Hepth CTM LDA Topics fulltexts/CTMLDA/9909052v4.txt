we briey review the nonlinear sigma model approach for the subject of increasing interest:
two-step phase transitions in the gross-neveu and the modied nambujona-lasinio models
at low n and condensation from pseudogap phase in strong-coupling superconductors. recent
success in describing bose-type superconductors that possess two characterstic temperatures and
a pseudogap above tc is the development approximately comparable with the bcs theory. one can
expect that it should have inuence on high-energy physics, similar to impact of the bcs theory on
this subject. although rst generalizations of this concept to particle physics were made recently,
these results were not systematized.
in this review we summarize this development and discuss
similarities and dierences of the appearence of the pseudogap phase in superconductors and the
gross-neveu and nambujona-lasinio - like models. we discuss its possible relevance for chiral
phase transition in qcd and color superconductors. this paper is organized in three parts: in the
rst section we briey review the separation of temperatures of pair formation and pair condensation
in strong - coupling and low carrier density superconductors (i.e. the formation of the pseudogap
phase ). second part is a review of nonlinear sigma model approach to an analogous phenomenon in
the chiral gross-neveu model at small n. in the third section we discuss the modied nambujona-
lasinio model where the chiral phase transition is accompanied by a formation of a phase analogous
to the pseudogap phase.

i. introduction

many concepts of particle physics have a close relation to superconductivity, for example the nambujona-lasinio
model [1]- [3] was proposed in analogy to the bcs theory of superconductivity and is considered as a low-energy
eective theory of qcd. recently a substantial progress has been made in the theory of superconductivity in systems
with strong attraction and low carrier density. that is, it has been observed that away from the limits of innitesimally
weak coupling strength or very high carrier density, bcs-like mean-eld theories are qualitatively wrong and these
systems possess along with superconductive phase an additional phase where there exist cooper pairs but no symmetry
is broken due to phase uctuations (the pseudogap phase). what may be regarded as an indication of the importance
of this concept to particle physics is that recently the formation of the pseudogap phase due to dynamic quantum
uctuations at low n was found in the chiral gross-neveu model in 2 +  dimensions [4].

separation of the temperatures of the pair formation and of the onset of phase coherence (pair condensation) in
strong-coupling superconductors, in fact, has been known already for many years (crossover from bcs supercon-
ductivity to bose-einstein condensation (bec) of tightly bound fermion pairs) [5,6]. intensive theoretical study of
these phenomena in the recent years (see for example [7]- [21]), was sparked by experimental results on underdoped
(low carrier density) cuprates that display gap-like feature above critical temperature tc that disappears only at a
substantially higher temperature t . there is experimental evidence that this phenomenon in high-tc superconduc-
tors may be connected with precritical pairing uctuations above tc. at present, this crossover has been studied by
variety of methods and in many dierent models.

because of intimate relationship of many problems in particle physics to superconductivity it seems natural to guess

that the pseudogap may become a fruitful concept in high energy physics too.

below we review these phenomena in superconductors and discuss its possible implications for qcd.

a. perturbative results

the bcs theory describes metallic superconductors perfectly. however, it failed to describe even qualitatively
superconductivity in underdoped high-tc compounds. one of the most exotic properties of the latter materials is the
existence of a pseudogap in the spectrum of the normal state well above critical temperature that from an experimental
point of view, manifests itself as a signicant suppression of low frequency spectral weight, thus being in contrast to
the exactly zero spectral weight in the case of the superconductive gap. moreover, spectroscopy experiments show
that a superconductive gap evolves smoothly in magnitude and wave vector dependence to a pseudogap in normal
state. besides that, nmr and tunneling experiments indicate the existence of incoherent cooper pairs well above
tc. in principle it is easy to guess what is hidden behind these circumstances, and why bcs theory is incapable of
describing it. let us imagine for a moment that we are able to bind electrons in cooper pairs innitely tightly -
obviously this implies that the characteristic temperature of thermal pair decomposition will also be innitely high,
but this does not imply that the long-range order will survive at innitely high temperatures. as rst observed in
[6], long-range order will be destroyed in a similar way, as say, in superuid 4he, i.e., tightly bound cooper pairs, at
a certain temperature will acquire a nonzero momentum and thus we will have gas of tightly bound cooper pairs but
no macroscopic occupation of the zero momentum level q = 0 and with it no long-range order. thus phase diagram
of a strong-coupling superconductor has three regions:

 the superconductive phase where there are condensed fermion pairs.
 the pseudogap phase where there exist fermion pairs but there is no condensate and thus there is no symmetry

breakdown and no superconductivity.

 the normal phase with thermally decomposed cooper pairs.

of course, the existence of bound pairs above the critical temperature will result in deviations from fermi-liquid
behavior that make the pseudogap phase a very interesting object of study. in order to describe superconductivity in
such a system the theory should incorporate pairs with nonzero momentum. thus,
the bcs scenario is invalid for
description of spontaneous symmetry breakdown in a system with strong attractive interaction or low carrier density
(see [6], [7] and references therein). so in principle in a strong-coupling superconductor onset of long range order has
nothing to do with pair formation transition. the existence of the paired fermions is only necessary but not sucient
condition for symmetry breakdown. the bcs limit is a rather exotic case of innitesimally weak coupling strength
and high carrier density when the disappearance of superconductivity can approximately be described a as pair-
breaking transition. the strong-coupling limit is another exotic case where the temperatures of pair decomposition
and symmetry breakdown can be arbitrarily separated. there is nothing surprising in it: formally, in the case of bose
condensation of 4he we can also introduce a characteristic temperature of thermal decomposition of the 4he atom;
however this does not mean that this temperature is somehow related to the temperature of the bose condensation
of the gas of he atoms. a schematic phase diagram of a superconductor is in shown in fig 1.

in the strong-coupling limit,
the temperature of the superconductive phase transition tends to a plateau value corresponding to the temperature of bose
condensation of a gas of tightly bound fermion pairs, whereas the characteristic temperature of thermal pair decomposition
grows monotonically as a function of the coupling strength.

let us show how one can obtain a pseudogap phase starting from the bcs hamiltonian. this was rst done in
the pioneering work by nozieres and schmitt-rink [6] and in the functional integral formalism for a system with
-function attraction by sa de melo, randeria and engelbrecht [9]. in this subsection we briey reproduce a part of
the transparent article [9] and in the following section we will show how qualitatively the same result can be obtained
within nonlinear sigma model (3d xy-model) approach proposed by the author [7].
in the following sections we
discuss analogous nonlinear-sigma model approach to the similar phenomena in the chiral gn and njl models.

the hamiltonian of the bcs model is:

h =x z ddx 

(x)(cid:18) 2

2m  (cid:19) (x) + gz ddx 

(x)

(x)(x)(x),

(1)

where (x) is the fermi eld operator,  =, denotes the spin components, m is the fermionic mass, and g < 0 the
strength of an attractive potential g(x  x).
the mean-eld equations for the gap parameter  and the chemical potential  can be obtained with a standard
variation procedure:

the -function potential produces divergence and requires regularization. a bcs superconductor possesses a natural
cuto supplied by the debye frequency d. for the crossover problem to be treated here this is no longer a useful
quantity, since in the strong-coupling limit all fermions participate in the interaction, not only those in a thin shell
of width d around the fermi surface. to be applicable in this regime, we renormalize the gap equation in three
dimensions with the help of the s-wave scattering length as, for which the low-energy limit of the two-body scattering
process gives an equally divergent expression [9]:

in which 1/kf as plays the role of a dimensionless coupling constant which monotonically increases from  to  as
the bare coupling constant g runs from small (bcs limit) to large values (bec limit). this equation is to be solved
simultaneously with (3). these mean-eld equations were analyzed e.g. in ref. [9].

, from (3) we have that chemical potential in this case is  = f .

in the bcs limit, the chemical potential  does not dier much from the fermi energy f , whereas with increasing
interaction strength, the distribution function nk broadens and  decreases, and in the bec limit we have tightly
(3)
bound pairs and nondegenerate fermions with a large negative chemical potential ||  t . analyzing eqns.
and (6) we have from (6) the critical temperature in the bcs limit (  tc) t bcs
= 8e2e1f exp(/2kf|as|)
where  = (1)/(1) = 0.577 . . .
in the
strong coupling limit, from eqs .
s is
the binding energy of the bound pairs.
in the bec limit, the mean-eld eq. (3) gives that the gap sets in at
t   eb/2 log(eb/f )3/2. a simple chemical equilibrium estimate (b = 2f ) yields for the temperature of pair
dissociation: tdissoc  eb/ log(eb/f )3/2 which shows that at strong couplings t  is indeed related to pair formation
[9] (which in the strong-coupling regime lies above the temperature of the onset of phase coherence [6,9]). obviously
t  is a monotonous function of coupling strength. if we take into the account gaussian uctuations we can see that
in the strong coupling regime, the temperature t , obtained with the above estimate is not related in any respect to
the critical temperature of the onset of phase coherence. expression for the thermodynamic potential with gaussian
corrections reads [6,9]:

(3), (6) we obtain that in the bec limit  = eb/2, where eb = 1/ma2

where nk is fermi occupation and iql = it 2l. it is convenient following to [6] to rewrite  in terms of a phase shift
according to denition: (q,   i0) = |(q, )| exp(i(q, )). after inclusion of gaussian correction the number
equation n = / reads:

n = n0(, t ) +xq z 



d


nb()




(q, )

(9)

where n0 is density of free fermions dened in (3) and nb() = 1/(exp(/t )  1) is the bose function. in order
to study behavior of tc one should solve a set of the number and gap equations. in the bcs limit tc is not aected
substantially by gaussian corrections, thus the superconductive transition can be described by mean-eld theory
and correspondingly tc  t . 1 in the opposite limit, numerical solution [6,9] show that the temperature of the
superconductive phase transition tends to a constant value that does not depend on the coupling strength and is equal
to the temperature of condensation of the ideal bose gas of particles of mass 2m and density n/2, where m and n are
the mass and density of electrons correspondingly:

tc =(cid:20)

n

2(3/2)(cid:21)2/3 

m

= 0.218f

(10)

where f was used simply as a dimensional constant, namely the fermi energy of the gas of free fermions with the
density n and mass m (obviously at very strong coupling strength, when all fermions are paired there is no fermi
surface).

the system of the gap and number equations can be solved analytically in the strong-coupling limit. first as it was
pointed in [6,9] one can make the following approximation: to retain gaussian corrections only in the number equation
and solve it together with mean-eld gap equation. near tc in the strong -coupling regime one nds that (tc) =
eb/2, where eb is the energy required to break a pair. one can observe that in this limit (q, z) has an isolated pole

1as rst discussed in 1960s, even in bcs superconductors there is a narrow region of precritical pairing uctuations. this
gives rise, e.g., to the so-called paraconductivity eect. in particle physics, this phenomenon was pointed out by hatsuda and
kunihiro [23,3]

4

on the real axis for each q, representing a two-body bound state with momentum q. since formally in this limit we can
make energy required to break a pair arbitrarily large, this pole is widely separated from the branch cut representing
the continuum of two-particle excitations. the low energy physics at temperatures much lower that temperature of
thermal pair decomposition is governed by this pole and one can write (q, iqm)  r(q)/[iqm  b(q) + 2], where
b(q)  eb + |q|2/4m. the partition function then may be written in the following form:

correspondingly the strong-coupling number equation reads:

xq,iql

z = z0z d d exp

n = n0 +xq

q(iql  b(q) + 2)q


nb[b(q)  2].

(11)

(12)

from which neglecting n0 follows the result (10) [6,9] 2.

b. nonperturbative nonlinear sigma-model (nlsm) approach to the bcs-bec crossover in superconductors

the above discussed crossover in the bcs model was recently studied in details perturbatively in a variety of
approximations (see for example [10,11]). qualitatively, essential features of this crossover can be reproduced in
another simple model system - with the help of deriving of an eective non-linear sigma model (i.e. 3d xy-model)
[7]. moreover in the same framework of nonlinear sigma model one can study as well analogous crossover in 2d
superconductor [13,14,19,7] that can not be addressed with discussed in the previous section perturbative method
due to absence of the long-range order in 2d. in two dimensions tc is identied with a temperature of the kosterltz-
thouless transition tkt in 2d xy-model. in the strong-coupling (or low carrier density) regime tkt lies signicantly
lower than the temperature of the pair formation [13,14,19,7].

as we have shown in [7], many essential features known from numerical study of strong-coupling and low carrier
density superconductors are reproduced with very good accuracy within 3dxy -model approach. in particular, in
the framework of nlsm approach there is no articial maximum in tc in the regime of intermedium couplings (which
appears in the approximation discussed in the previous section).

1. xy-model approach to 3d superconductors

let us now reproduce results of previous subsection in the framework of nlsm approach proposed by the author

[7].

it is very transparent to study the properties of the bcs-bec crossover to employ modulus-phase variables.
following to witten [24] we can write a partition function as a functional integral over modulus and phase of the
hubbard-stratonovich eld  exp(i):

z(, t ) =z dd exp [(t, (x), (x))].

(13)

assuming that phase uctuations do not aect local modulus of the complex hubbard -stratonovich eld we can write
thermodynamic potential as a sum of potential and kinetic (gradient) terms:

((x), (x))  grad(t, , (x)) + pot(t, ) =z d3x

j(t, )

2

()2 + pot(t, ).

(14)

2the above estimate by [6,9] when we retained corrections only in the number equation renders correct limiting result (10)
however as it was observed by the authors of [6,9] in the intermediate coupling regime it gives an articial maximum in tc as
a function of coupling strength, this artifact is removed in higher approximations [10]

5

obviously in the above expression the eective potential pot(t, ) coincides with the ordinary mean-eld eective
potential. the gradient term grad(t, , (x)) coincides with the hamiltonian of 3d xy model with a stiness
j(, t ).

let us reproduce low-temperature expression for the phase stiness in strong-coupling regime from [7]:

j =

n
4m 

32m
162 t 3/2 exp"p2 + 2

t

# .

(15)

where n and m are density and mass of fermions. we can see that thermal corrections to the rst term in this regime
are exponentially suppressed and the r.h.s. tends in this limit quickly to

jbe =

n
4m

.

(16)

the form of this expression is not surprising - we see that at suciently strong coupling strength all fermions are
bound to pairs and stiness becomes equal of the low-temperature phase stiness of the bose gas of density n/2
and boson mass 2m. obviously all information about internal structure of composite bosons is evaporated from this
expression in this approximation since at low temperature in this regime there are no thermal pair decomposition
eects 3. thus we see that low-temperature expression for the stiness of the phase uctuations reaches a plateau
value with increasing coupling strength, whereas temperature of the thermal pair decomposition is a monotonously
growing function of the coupling strength.

in principle knowledge of lowest gradient term governing gaussian uctuations is not sucient for the study of the
position of the phase decoherence transition in a system with preformed pairs. in continuum, 3d xy model is a free
eld theory and there is no phase transition. phase transition of 3d xy model was studied in great details on a
lattice, so we can consider a lattice model of bcs-bec crossover and we can verify aposteriory to what extend lattice
model reproduces features of this crossover in continual model. many aspects of relation of 3d xy model to bose
condensation, in particular derivation of the gross-pitaevskii equation near tc can be found in [26].

so, let us consider theory (14) on a lattice with spacing a = 1/n1/3

pair where npair is concentration of cooper pairs.
this model describes condensation of hard-core bosons on the lattice and is a special case of bose-hubbard model 4.
critical temperature of the phase transition of 3d xy model can be obtained with a simple mean-eld estimate

[26] 5:

where a = n1/3
pair is the lattice spacing. in contrast to the ordinary 3dxy -model, in order to nd temperature of the
phase transition we should study a system of the equations (3), (6) , (15) and (17). system of these equations can be
solved however analytically in the strong coupling limit, the result is [7]:

with increasing coupling strength, this quickly tends from below to the value (compare with (10)):

(18)

(19)

where constant f is fermi energy of free fermi gas of density n and fermion mass m. we should observe that in
nonperturbative nlsm approach tc approaches plateau value (19), that depends only on mass 2m and density n/2

3in [7] we employed a nite-temperature generalization of the gradient expansion at t = 0 discussed in [25].
4in the ordinary attractive hubbard model considered in [6] the critical temperature is a nonmonotonous function of the
coupling strength: tc decreases in the strong-coupling limit due to in that model composite bosons move via virtual ionization.
5 we should stress that estimation of critical temperature of the phase transition of the eective 3d xy model with mean-eld
methods has nothing to do with bcs mean eld approximation since derivation of the phase stiness coecient (15) required
studying the gaussian uctuations in the bcs model [7], and thus this may be regarded as the approximation of the same level
as considered in the previous section.

6

of composite bosons, from below. this is in agreement with numerical study in higher approximations [10], whereas
in the approach presented in previous subsection tc has an articial maximum at the intermediate coupling strength
thus approaching the limiting value from above. another circumstance that we discuss below is that nlsm approach
gives also qualitatively correct results in the opposite limit of weak-coupling strength [7]. in the weak-coupling limit
near tc, the stiness coecient may be derived with the help of gorkovs well-known method :

jbcs =

7
484 (3)

p3
f
m

t 2 ,

(20)

this is precisely the coecient of the gradient term in the ginzburg-landau expansion. in the weak-coupling limit
the two temperatures of the onset of pairing correlations and the onset of phase coherence t  and tc merge according
to the formula [7]:

tc = t  

(22)2/3

2

t 5/2
3/2
f

 t ,

(21)

with it one can see [7] that in the weak-coupling limit, the temperature of the phase transition of the eective
xy-model tends from below to the characteristic temperature of the disappearance of the eective potential and
merges with it for innitesimally weak coupling strength. thus we arrive at some sort of aposteriori verication of
bcs behavior in this limit in the model of hard-core composite bosons on the lattice (i.e.
in this limit if nonzero
modulus of the complex gap function ei(x) appears at some temperature, at the same temperature phase coherence is
established and continuous symmetry is broken). in the weak and moderate coupling strength limits the disappearance
of superconductivity is a competition of two processes - pairbreaking which is thermal excitation of individual particles
and decoherence process which is thermal excitation of collective modes.

let us now summarize the results that follow from the nlsm consideration. in this model in strong-coupling or

low carrier density regimes system possesses three phases:

1. superconductive phase (t < t 3dxy

c

).

2. pseudogap phase (t 3dxy

< t < t ) - the phase where there exists a local gap modulus  that signalizes
existence of the tightly bound (but noncondenced) fermion pairs but phase is random so average of the complex
gap is zero (< || exp(i) >= 0). so in this phase there is no superconductive gap and with it no symmetry
breakdown.

c

3. normal phase (t > t ) the phase with thermally decomposed cooper pairs.

2. xy-model approach to 2d superconductors

in two dimension there is no proper long-range order and superconductive phase transition is associated with a
kosterlitz-thouless transition. in order to study this transition it is sucient to extract lowest gradient term that
determines temperature of the phase transition according to the formula [13], [14] [19], [7] 6:

tkt =


2

j(, tkt, (, tkt)).

(22)

this equation just like in the discussed above 3d case should be solved self-consistently with equations for the gap
modulus and chemical potential (3), (6). the result in the strong-coupling limit is [7]:

tkt 


8

n

m(cid:26)1 

1
8

exp(cid:20) 2

f  4(cid:21)(cid:27) .

(23)

thus for increasing coupling strength, the phase-decoherence temperature tkt tends very quickly towards a constant
value [13,14,19,7] corresponding to kt transition in system of bosons with density n/2 and mass 2m (whereas

6 in principle there is no kt phase transition in a charged system due to meissner eect, however coupling to electromagnetic
eld is always neglected in discussion of 2d superconductors, due to experimentally in-plane penetration length in high-tc
materials is much larger than coherence length.

7

characteristic temperature of the thermal pair decomposition continues to grow monotonously with the growing
coupling strength):

tkt =


8

n
m

.

(24)

so, this phenomenon in 2d is qualitatively similar to the above discussed 3d case.

there is no superconductivity in the pseudogap phase however it exhibits rich exotic non-fermi-liquid behavior
due to local pairing correlations that makes it as interesting an object of theoretical and experimental study as the
superconductive phase itself. in particular, along with specic heat, optical conductivity and tunneling experiments
there are following circumstances observed in the pseudogap phase: in experiments on ybco a signicant suppression
of in-plane conductivity ab() was observed at frequencies below 500 cm1 beginning at temperatures much above tc.
experiments on underdoped samples revealed deviations from the linear resistivity law. in particular ab( = 0; t )
increases slightly with decreasing t below a certain temperature. nmr and neutrons observations show that below
temperatures t  much higher than tc, spin susceptibility starts decreasing.

in conclusion, let us once more emphasis essential features of this phenomenon in superconductivity:

 away from a very special limit of innitesimally weak coupling strength and high carrier density, superconductors
are characterized by two temperatures tc and t (>> tc). t  is the characteristic temperature below which
pair correlations become important (or in the regime of strong interaction it is the characteristic temperature
of the formation of real bound pairs). tc corresponds to the onset of phase coherence in a system of preformed
fermion pairs. the region of non-fermi liquid behavior between tc and t  calls the pseudogap phase, however
the term pseudogap, originated in early experimental papers, may seem somewhat misleading since, even
though a substantial depletion of low-frequency spectral weight is observed in this region experimentally - there
is no superconductive gap in the spectrum.
 one should note that there is no proper phase transition at t , which is simply a characteristic temperature
of thermal decomposition of certain fraction of noncondensed cooper pairs. even though the position of this
temperature may be reasonable estimated with mean-eld methods, second-order phase transition at t  is
certainly an artifact of the discussed above approximation. experiments on specic heat indicate however
certain features at this characteristic temperature.

in what follows we discuss possible implication of these results to qcd that may posses a phase analogous to the
pseudogap phase in strong-coupling superconductors. the simplest model related to particle physics that displays
pseudogap behavior of dynamical origin is chiral gross-neveu model at low n that is discussed in the next section
in 2 +  dimensions.

iii. pseudogap phase in chiral gross-neveu model in 2 +  dimensions at low n

let us now discuss a phenomenon similar to pseudogap in a simple eld-theoretic model - chiral version of the

gross-neveu model [27], whose lagrange density is

g0

2n h(cid:0) aa(cid:1)2

(25)

l = ai / a +

+(cid:0) ai5a(cid:1)2i .

where index a runs from 1 to n . appearance of the pseudogap phase in this model has quite similar roots with the
above discussed phenomenon in strong-coupling superconductors. in superconductors we observed appearance of the
pseudogap phase on the phase diagram in the region away from the limits of innitesimally weak coupling strength
or extremely high carrier density - i.e.
in the regime when bcs mean-eld treatment is no longer valid. chiral
gross-neveu model can be treated in the limit of innite number of eld components n in a framework of mean-eld
approach quite similar to bcs theory. transparently in the mean-eld approximation one can nd only one phase
transition at certain value of the coupling strength, similar to bcs phase transition. however, at low n , system start
to perform dynamic chiral uctuations which as we have shown in [4] give rise to a second, phase disorder, transition.
so at low n the model possesses two transitions at two characteristic values of renormalized coupling constant. let
us reproduce this result.

8

one can write the collective eld action for this model as:

acoll[] = n(cid:26)

1
2g0

(2 + 2)  itr log [i /  (x)  i5](cid:27) .

(26)

this expression is invariant under the continuous set of chiral o(2) transformations which rotate  and  elds into
each other. this model is equivalent to another one:

in the limit n   this result is exact. on the other hand in the opposite limit of low n the system starts to

let us consider rst the case  = 0 where the collective eld theory consists of complex eld  with o(2)-symmetry
 = ||ei. such a system possesses macroscopic excitations of the form of vortices and antivortices that attract each
other by a logarithmic coulomb potential. it is known [28] that in a such eld theory involving a pure phase eld
(x), with a lagrange density

l =

[(x)]2,

(36)

where  is the stiness of the -uctuations, there is a kostrelitz-thouless transition when the stiness falls below
kt = 2/ [28].

let us return to gross-neveu model. performing an expansion around saddle point solution one can nd propagator

of the -eld when  = 0 [4,24]:

we identify the stiness  = n/4.

the pair version of the chiral gross-neveu model has therefore a vortex-antivortex pair breaking transition if n

falls below the critical value nc = 8 [4].

consider now the model in 2 +  dimensions where pairs form when renormalized coupling constant becomes larger

than the critical value g = g  . in this case the expression for the stiness of phase uctuations reads [4]

fig. 2. the two transition lines in the n  g-plane of the chiral gross-neveu model in 2 +  dimensions. in order to stress
dierence between the local gap (i.e. pseudogap) and the order parameter analogous to the superconductive gap we denote
by m modulus of the order parameter (m = |0|). in this model m plays the role of the quark mass. for  = 0, the vertical
transition line coincides with the n -axis, and the solid hyperbola degenerates into a horizontal line at nc = 8. in the limit
n   generation of the quark mass happens simultaneously with phase ordering transition.

7there is a misleading statement about 3d case in [4]

10

in the chiral formulation of the same model in 2 + dimensions, the pseudogap phase has chiral symmetry in spite
of a nonzero spontaneously generated quark mass m = |0| 6= 0. this phase is directly related to the pseudogap
phase of a strong-coupling superconductor - where there are cooper pairs but there is no symmetry breakdown due
to violent phase uctuations. the reason why this is possible is that the quark mass depends only on |0|, thus
allowing for arbitrary phase uctuations preserving chiral symmetry. it is very easy to see that the solid hyperbola
in fig. 2 is not simply the proper (albeit approximate) continuation of the vertical line for smaller n . there are two
simple arguments. one is formal: for innitesimal  the rst transition lies precisely at g = g =  for all n , so that
the horizontal transition line is clearly distinguished from it (stiness of the phase uctuation in the regime g/g  0,
just like in the case of superconductor, reaches plateau value that does not depend on the coupling strength and ).
the other argument is physical and also has a clear analogy in the corresponding phenomena in superconductivity. if
n is lowered at some very large g, the binding energy of the pairs increases with 1/n {in two dimensions, the binding
energy is 4m sin2[/2(n  1)]}. it is then impossible that the phase uctuations on the horizontal branch of the
transition line, which are low-energy excitations, unbind the strongly bound pairs. accuracy of the bcs scenario
in the limit n   is clearly seen from the form of phase stiness which has a factor n that freezes the phase
uctuations in this limit and thus all the physics is essentially governed by the size of the gap modulus.
the 2 + 1-dimensional chiral gross-neveu model [29] also exhibits an analogous behavior at nite temperature
[30] where a similar eect is governed by thermal uctuations. at nite n the temperature of kt transition deviates
from mean-eld temperature of the gap modulus formation, however in d=2+1 the phase diagram is substantially
dierent from the phase diagram of the same model in d = 2 +  at t = 0 (see detailed discussion in [30])8.

iv. chiral fluctuations in the the njl model at zero temperature

recently an attempt was made [31] to generalize to the njl model the nonlinear-sigma approach for description
of chiral uctuations proposed in [4,7]. the authors [31] claimed that at nc = 3 the njl model does not display
spontaneous symmetry breakdown due to chiral uctuations. we show below that the nlsm approach does not allow
to prove that chiral symmetry is always restored by uctuations in the njl model at nc = 3. below we also discuss
dierences from the chiral gn model, where the nlsm approach allows one to reach a similar conclusion at low n .

the lagrangian of the njl model reads [1]

l = i/ +

g0

2nc h(cid:0) (cid:1)2

+(cid:0) ai5(cid:1)2i .

the three 2 2-dimensional matrices a/2, generate the fundamental representation of avor su (2), and are normal-
ized by tr(ab) = 2ab. one can introduce hubbard - stratonovich elds  and a:

(41)

(42)

l =  (i/    i5aa)  

nc

2g0 (cid:0)2 + 2
a(cid:1) .

after integrating out quark elds, following a standard mean-eld variation procedure one can choose the pseudoscalar
solution a to vanish and the scalar solution   m to be given by a gap equation:

1
g0

= i(trf 1)(tr1)z

ddp
(2)d

p2  m 2

(43)

the momentum integral is regularized by means of a cuto . the constituent quark mass m in the limit nc  
is analogous to the superconductive gap in the bcs limit of the theory of superconductivity.
at nite nc one can study uctuations around the saddle point solution. the quadratic terms of expansion around

the saddle point are:

8it should be emphasized that the existence of the pseudogap phase in 2+1 dimensions due to thermal uctuations in the
chiral gross-neveu model can not be rigorously proven in contrast to 2+-dimensional case discussed in this section (when there
are two small parameters  and 1/n ). the 2+1 dimensional problem lacks a small parameter which would allow to estimate
accurately the position of t  at very small n , however it can be argued that rough low-n estimates show the appearance of
thermal-uctuations-induced pseudogap phase in this model, especially pronounced at n  4.

in analogy to 3d xy -model approach to strong-coupling superconductivity [7] the authors of [31] introduced a unit
vector eld ni  (n0, na)  (, a)/ and set up an eective nonlinear sigma-model

a0[ni] =



2 z d4x[ni(x)]2.

(46)

the prefactor  = m 2z(m/), that follows from eqs. (44) and (45) plays the role of the stiness of the unit eld
uctuations.

now let us observe that from the arguments given in [31] it does not follow that the njl model necessarily remains
in a chirally symmetric phase at nc = 3. at rst, in contrast to the (2 + )-dimensional case, discussed in [4], one
can not make unfortunately, any similar calculations in a closed form in 3 + 1-dimensions because this theory is not
renormalizable. it was already observed in [32]- [34] that the cuto of meson loops cannot be set equal to the cuto
for quark loops and thus the 1/nc corrected theory [34] possesses two independent parameters that may be adjusted
at will. we present another argument of a dierent nature rooted in the nonuniversality of the critical stiness of a
nlsm in four dimensions, which does not allow one to reach the conclusion of [31] in the framework of the nlsm
approach. our observation also applies to the nlsm description of precritical uctuations in general systems. it also
allows us to show that the additional cuto discussed below can not be related to the inverse coherence length of the
radial uctuations in the eective potential as suggested in [35,31].

the authors of [31] by deriving g, have essentially extracted two characteristics from the initial system: the
stiness of the phase uctuations in the degenerate minimum of the eective potential and the mass of the radial uc-
tuation. however, knowledge of these characteristics does not allow one in principle to judge if directional uctuations
will destroy long range order or the system will possess a bcs-like phase transition. the reason is that the critical
stiness of the nonlinear sigma model is not an universal quantity in 3 + 1-dimensions. so in principle knowledge of
the stiness of njl model is not sucient for nding the position of the phase transition in the eective nonlinear
sigma model. the situation is just like that in a heisenberg magnet, where the critical temperature depends on the
stiness along with lattice spacing and lattice structure. thus if one is given only a stiness coecient one can not
determine the temperature of the phase transition. the situation is in contrast to the 2d case where the position of
a kt-transition can be deduced from the stiness coecient [28].

let us recall a procedure for expressing the critical stiness of the o(4)-nonlinear sigma model via an additional
i = 1 and introduce an extra integration over the lagrange multiplier ,

parameter: one can relax the constraint n2

rewriting eq. (46) as: (/2)z d4x(cid:8)[ni(x)]2 + (cid:2)n2

(47)

where nn is the number of components of ni(x) and tr denotes the functional trace. this yields a gap equation:

the model has a phase transition at a critical stiness that depends on an unspecied additional cuto parameter
that should be applied to the gap equation:

(48)

for example, in the case of magnets the additional cuto needed in eq. (49) is naturally related to the lattice spacing.
in [35] a criterion was proposed that states that one can relate the inverse coherence length extracted from radial

uctuations in an eective potential of an initial theory to the cuto in the integral (49) so that all the parameters
in a theory would be expressed from quantities derived from an initial model, and thus this modied model possesses
a universal critical stiness. however, unfortunately there is no reason for relating the cuto needed in eq. (49)
to the coherence length of the modulus uctuations and moreover we show that this procedure leads in general to
unphysical consequences. it should also be observed that it does not make the theory consistent anyway because
of the following circumstance: the authors of [31] suggested that, since pions in the symmetry broken phase are
composite they are not dened over the length scales much shorter than the inverse binding energy of the pair wave
function which is equal to 2m . thus the authors of [31] performed integral in (49) up to cuto 4m 2. however, since,
as suggested in [31], the pion elds are not dened over the length scales much shorter than the inverse binding
energy this may only serve as an estimate for upper boundary of what would be the universal critical stiness value.
so, unfortunately one can not make the conclusion of absence of symmetry breakdown in such a modied theory by
observing that stiness derived from the initial model is smaller than the maximal possible value of would be universal
critical stiness. it was also supposed in [35] that the relation of the coherence length to the cuto in the equation
(49) yields a universal criterion for judging the nature of symmetry breakdown in general physical systems. there is
a simple counterexample: in the case of a strong-coupling superconductor, the eective nonlinear sigma model that
describes uctuations in a degenerate valley of the eective potential is a 3d xy-model. in the continuous case it is
a free eld theory and has no phase transition at all. the phase transition appears only in the lattice theory and, of
course its temperature depends on the lattice spacing. as we discussed above with increasing coupling strength the
low-temperature phase stiness of the eective 3d xy model tends to a plateau value j = n/4m, where n and m are
the density and the mass of fermions [7]. thus the temperature of the phase transition of the eective 3d xy-model
is

t 3dxy
c

n
m

a,



(50)

where a is the lattice spacing. to be careful one should remark that accurate analysis shows that a strong coupling
superconductor possesses two characteristic length scales: size of the cooper pairs which tends to zero with increasing
coupling strength, and a coherence length that tends to innity with increasing coupling strength as the system evolves
towards a weakly nonideal gas of true composite bosons [9,20]. first if one relates the constant a in (50) to the size
of the cooper pairs following to the arguments of [31] one will come to an incorrect conclusion of the absence of
superconductivity in strong-coupling superconductors, in a similar way as the authors of [31] came to the conclusion
of the nonexistence of symmetry breakdown in the njl model. this is in a direct contradiction with behavior of the
strong coupling superconductors discussed above. second, if one attempts to relate a in (50) to the second length
scale of the theory, namely, the true coherence length, which tends to innity with increasing coupling strength, then
one will also come to a qualitatively incorrect conclusion [36].

thus, in general, the nonlinear sigma model approach for precritical uctuations possesses an additional tting
parameter, which is the cuto in the gap equation (49), which can not be related to the inverse coherence length
extracted from radial uctuations in an eective potential. thus within the nlsm approach one can not prove if the
njl model displays necessarily the directional uctuations-driven restoration of chiral symmetry at low nc.

v. chiral fluctuations at finite temperature and a modified njl model with a

pseudogap

this section is based on the paper [38]. the authors of [31] employed nlsm arguments in an attempt to show
that the njl model cannot serve the study of the chiral symmetry breakdown. we have shown in the above that this
conclusion appears to be incorrect since the critical stiness in 3+1-dimensions is not a universal quantity and one
has an additional tting parameter. this is an inherent feature of the discussed nlsm approach in 3+1 dimensions
(compare with the cutos discussions in nonrenormalizable models in a dierent approach [32]- [34], and also [37]). the
above circumstance allows one to x the critical stiness from phenomenological considerations. however, we argue
below that, what is missed in [31] is that, in principle, the low-nc uctuation instabilities, when properly treated, have
a clear physical meaning. moreover, we argue that one can employ a nlsm for describing the chiral uctuations (e.g.
at nite temperature), provided that special care is taken of the additional cuto parameter. indeed, it was already
discussed in the literature that at nite temperatures the chiral phase transition should be accompanied by developed
uctuations ( [3,23] and references therein). we argue that this process at low nc should give rise to a phase analogous
to the pseudogap phase that may be conveniently described within a nonlinear sigma model approach. there are
indeed other ways to describe these phenomena, however the nlsm approach seems to be especially convenient. the

13

description of the two-step chiral phase transition and appearance of the intermediate phase requires one to study the
system at the next-to-mean-eld level. unfortunately, the njl model is not renormalizable and does not allow one
to make any conclusions about the importance of uctuations in a closed form [34]. on the other hand, a pseudogap
phase is a general feature of fermi systems with composite bosons. the nlsm construction discussed below, because
of its nonperturbative nature, can not be regarded as a regular approximation but may be considered as a tractable
modication of the njl model that has a pseudogap. one can also nd an additional motivation for employing these
arguments in the fact that the nlsm approach allows one to prove the existence of the phase analogous to pseudogap
phase in the chiral gn model [4,30] which is the closest relative of the njl model. also the nlsm approach works
well for the description of precritical uctuations in superconductors [7] - where essentially the same results have been
obtained with dierent methods and in dierent models. we stress that these phenomena are a general feature of any
fermi system with attraction. also, to a certain extent similar crossovers are known in a large variety of condensed
matter systems. in particular, besides superconductors we might mention the exitonic condensate in semiconductors,
josephson junction arrays, itinerant and local-momentum theories of magnetism and ferroelectrics.

let us now consider the chiral uctuations in the njl model at nite temperature. then, following standard
dimensional reduction arguments [see e.g. [39]], the chiral uctuations should be described by a 3d o(4)-sigma
model. thus one has the following gap equation for the eective nlsm (i.e. the nite temperature analog of (48)):

the temperature of the phase transition of the three dimensional classical o(4) sigma model with stiness jt is
expressed via the additional parameter t needed in (51) as :

the stiness of thermal uctuations jt can be readily extracted from the njl model. at nite temperature the

(55)

is the stiness of the thermal uctuations in the degenerate valley of the eective potential. the temperature -
dependent quark mass m that enters this expression is given by a standard mean-eld gap equation which also should
be regularized with the cuto t :

(56)

it can be easily seen that, when we approach the temperature t  where the mass m (t ) becomes zero, the sti-
ness j(t, t , m, nc) also tends to zero. formula (54) denes a generalized heisenberg model with a temperature-
dependent stiness coecient. the position of the phase disorder transition in a such system should be determined
self-consistently by solving the system of equations for tc and m (tc). apparently just as in a superconductor with a
pseudogap, the phase transition in such a system is a competition between the thermal depletion of the gap modulus

14

(this roughly corresponds to thermal pair breaking in a superconductor) and the process of thermal excitations of the
directional uctuations in the degenerate minimum of the eective potential. the bcs limit corresponds to the
situation where t  merges with tc and it is easily seen that this scenario always holds true at nc  . that is, at
innite n the mean-eld theory is always accurate just as bcs theory works well in weak-coupling superconductors.
in the framework of this nlsm construction, at low nc the scenario of the phase transition depends on the choice of
m (0), t , and t , which should be xed from phenomenological considerations.

vi. conclusion

the precursor pairing uctuations is a general feature of any fermi system with composite bosons and it is the
dominant region of a phase diagram of strong-coupling and low-carrier-density superconductors. at the moment it is
a subject of increasing interest in dierent branches of physics. in the rst part of this paper we briey outlined the
nonlinear sigma model approach to this phenomenon in superconductors in two and three dimensions. in the second
part we discussed similar phomena in the chiral gross-neveu and nambujona-lasinio models. this discussion should
have relevance for hot qcd and color superconductors.

we also note that in some sense similar phenomena are known in a large variety of condensed matter systems, in
particular, besides superconductors we can mention itinerant and local-momentum theories of magnetism, exitonic
condensate in semiconductors, ferroelectrics and josephson junction arrays [40].

we would like to stress that the main purpose of this paper is to summarize present discussions of precursor uctu-
ations in the gross-neveu and nambujona-lasinio models. we illustrated the discussion with a few examples from
superconductivity, outlining occurrence of similar phenomena in several arbitrarily chosen models of superconductors
with pseudogaps. thus this paper can not be regarded as a review of this phenomenon in superconductivity which
evolved recently to a very large branch of condensed matter physics. thus our references to the papers on supercon-
ductivity are by denition incomplete, for more complete set of references reader may consult corresponding reviews
on superconductivity [e.g. the review [12] ].

[36] as we discussed in the rst part of the paper, in a nonperturbative nlsm approach to the condensation from pseudogap
phase in strong-coupling superconductors one can reach an excellent agreement with the perturbative results [6,9] if one
considers an eective sigma model on the lattice with the spacing given by a  1/n1/3
, where nb is density of cooper pairs
[7]. then the model is related to the condensation of hard-core composite bosons on a lattice.
