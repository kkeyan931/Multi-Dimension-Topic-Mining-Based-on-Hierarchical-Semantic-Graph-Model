abstract: we consider n = 2 super yang-mills theory with su (2) gauge group and a single quark
hypermultiplet in the fundamental representation. for a specic value of the quark bare mass and at a
certain point in the moduli space of vacua, the central charges corresponding to two mutually non-local
electro-magnetic charges vanish simultaneously, indicating the possibility of massless such states in the
spectrum. by realizing the theory as an m -theory conguration, we show that these states indeed exist
in the spectrum near the critical point.

introduction

during the last few years, the low-energy eective theories of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theories
in d = 4 space-time dimensions with various gauge groups and matter representations have been subject
of much interest, following [1]. at a generic point on the coulomb branch of the moduli space of vacua,
the massless degrees of freedom constitute r free u (1) vector multiplets, where r is the rank of the
microscopic gauge group. the dynamics of these multiplets is encoded in the special kahler geometry of
the coulomb branch. the states of the theory are characterized by their electric and magnetic charges
ne and nm with respect to the u (1) gauge elds and possibly also some quark number charges s (if
the microscopic theory contains hyper multiplet matter). given two such states with quantum numbers
(ne, nm, s) and (n

m, s ) respectively, we can form the symplectic product

e, n

c = ne  n

m  nm  n
e.

(1)

to see the physical signicance of c, we can consider quantizing one of the particles in the presence of the
other. the wave function is then in fact a section of a non-trivial line bundle over (punctured) space,
the rst chern class of which, when evaluated on an s 2, equals c. we say that the states are mutually
non-local if c is non-zero.

the mass m of an arbitrary state obeys the inequality

m  |z|,

(2)

where z is the the central charge that appears in the n = 2 supertranslations algebra. the central
charge is in general a linear combination of conserved abelian charges, e.g.

z = a  ne + ad  nm + m  s,

(3)

where the coecients a, ad and m are some holomorphic functions of the moduli and parameters of the
theory. states which saturate the bound (2), so called bps states, are of particular interest. being the
lightest states in their charge sector, generically they cannot disappear as the moduli and parameters of
the theory are varied. (the exception is when a domain wall of marginal stability is reached, where the
phases of the central charges of three bps states are equal. it might then be possible for the heaviest
particle to decay into the two lighter ones and be absent from the spectrum on the other side of the
domain wall.)

along certain submanifolds of the coulomb branch, the central charges corresponding to certain sets
of quantum numbers vanish. the corresponding bps states, if they are present in the spectrum of the
theory, would then be massless. the nature of the low energy eective theory depends crucially on the
electric and magnetic quantum numbers of these states. if the symplectic product c vanishes for any pair
of massless particles, it is always possible to perform an electric/magnetic duality transformation after
which all massless states have purely electric charges. the low energy eective theory would then be
massless n = 2 supersymmetric qed with some number of dierent avours of matter. our focus in this
paper is the case when at least one symplectic product does not vanish, so that the theory necessarily
contains both electrically and magnetically charged massless states. the low energy eective theory is
then an exotic interacting n = 2 superconformal theory with no known lagrangian description.

an example where such a phenomenon could possibly occur was rst discovered in pure su (3) super
yang-mills theory, where the central charges for mutually non-local states vanishes at a certain critical

2

point in the moduli space [2]. an equivalent critical point can be found in the moduli space of su (2)
super yang-mills theory with a single hyper multiplet in the fundamental representation [3]. there are
also more complicated examples known. in all these examples, the relevant bps states are known to exist
in the spectrum in the weak-coupling region, where semi-classical methods can be trusted. the critical
point is at strong coupling, though, and it is conceivable that these states have decayed at some domain
wall of marginal stability before this point is reached. the purpose of this paper is to investigate a
theory close to such a critical point to see whether the spectrum really contains arbitrarily light mutually
non-local states.

given a set of quantum numbers (ne, nm, s), it is in general a dicult problem to determine if a
corresponding bps state exists in the spectrum (at a given point in the moduli space) [4]. in principle,
this question can be answered by realizing the theory as an m -theory conguration [5]. we thus consider
m -theory on an eleven-manifold m 1,10 of the form

m 1,10  r1,3  r3  q4,

(4)

where the rst factor is four-dimensional minkowski space, the second factor is three dimensional eu-
clidean space, and the last factor is some four-dimensional manifold of su (2) holonomy. we also introduce
an m -theory ve-brane with a world-volume of the form w 1,5 of the form

w 1,5  r1,3  p  ,

(5)

where p is a point in r3 and  is a two-manifold in q4. the theory on w 1,5 then has an eective
four-dimensional low-energy limit on r1,3, and this is the theory we are interested in. excitations around
the vacuum dened by m 1,10 and w 1,5 are described by m -theory two-branes (membranes) with world-
volumes s 1,2 of the form

s 1,2    p  d,

(6)

where  denes the world-line of a particle in r1,3 and d is a two-manifold in q4 whose boundary
c = d lies on . (that a two-brane can end on a ve-brane has been shown in [6].) the mass m of
the state is given by

m = 2zd

vd,

(7)

where vd is the volume-form of d. the homology class [c] of c determines the quantum numbers
(ne, nm, s) of the state. in particular, the intersection number [c]  [c ] of two homology classes equals
the symplectic product of the corresponding electric and magnetic charges, i.e.

[c]  [c ] = ne  n

m  nm  n
e.

(8)

the su (2) holonomy of q4 means that this space is hyper kahler, i.e. it admits a two-sphere s 2 of
inequivalent complex structures j. equivalently, it can be regarded as a ricci-at kahler manifold, and
therefore admits a covariantly constant holomorphic two-form . the relationship between these two
descriptions is as follows: given a complex structure j, we have   k  + ik , where k  and k  are
the kahler forms corresponding to two other complex structures j  and j  such that j, j  and j  are all
orthogonal. the requirement that the eective theory on r1,3 has n = 2 supersymmetry is equivalent
to demanding that  be holomorphically embedded in q4 with respect to some complex structure j [7].
the central charge z of a state corresponding to a two-manifold d is then given by

z = zd

d,

3

(9)

where d is the pullback (by the embedding map) of  to d. one can show that the inequality (2)
holds. it is saturated, i.e. the state is bps, if d is holomorphically embedded with respect to a complex
structure j  which is orthogonal to j. given j, there is a circle s 1 of such j , corresponding to the phase
of the central charge z.

before we answer the question of the light spectrum near a critical point, we must decide exactly what
states we are looking for. the strongest result would be to establish the existence of mutually non-local
bps states, the masses of which of course vanish as we approach the critical point where their central
charges vanish. this is fairly dicult, though, since one would have to construct the corresponding
two-manifolds d exactly. the requirements that d be holomorphically embedded with respect to the
appropriate complex structure and also intersects  along a real curve are dicult to analyze, except
in certain special situations. an alternative would be to simply nd mutually non-local states, whose
masses vanish at the critical point but which are not bps. this would be a fairly weak result: given
two such states, one could construct a third such state by simply taking the sum of the corresponding
two-manifolds d. we will instead consider an intermediate set of states that we call asymptotically bps.
by this we mean that

m/|z|  1

(10)

as we approach the critical point. this implies that m goes to zero as we approach the critical point.
however, the sum of two such states is in general not of the same kind.
it seems plausible that the
existence of an asymptotically bps state implies the existence of a bps state, but we have no proof of
this.

2 the computation

we will consider the case of su (2) super yang-mills theory with one hypermultiplet quark in the funda-
mental representation. as explained in [5], the hyper kahler manifold q4 is in this case simply r3  s 1
with coordinates x 4, x 5, x 6 and x 10, where x 10 is periodic with period 2. the complex structure j
can be described by declaring that s = x 6 + ix 10 and v = x 4 + ix 5 are holomorphic coordinates. the
kahler form k and the covariantly constant holomorphic two-form  are then given by

k = i (ds  ds + dv  dv)
 = 2ds  dv.

(11)

it is convenient to replace s by the single-valued coordinate t = exp(s). then the complex surface 
can be written as ([8], [9])

t2 + (v2  2)t + 3(v  m) = 0.

(12)

here m is the bare mass of the quark hypermultiplet, and the modulus 2 parametrizes the moduli space
of vacua.  is the dynamically generated scale of the theory, which we will choose so that 3 = 2. if
we solve the equation for s =  log t we then get

where

s =  log(cid:18)

f =

(14)

we see that  can be thought of as a double cover of the v-plane (because of the ambiguity of the square
root). the two sheets meet at the four branch points, joined by branch cuts, where f vanishes.

generically, the branch points lie at dierent values of v, but by choosing m = 3

2 and 2 = 3 (the
4 (v  1)3(v + 3), i.e. three of the branch points coincide at v = 1.

argyres-douglas point), we get f = 1
we are interested in the geometry close to this point, so we write

m =
2 = 3 + 2
v = 1 + u.

dropping all non-leading terms in m, 2 and u, we then get

where

and v is dened so that

s = u pf ,

f = u3  (v)3

(v)3 = 2m  2.

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

the three branch points are thus located at u = v, where  is an arbitrary cubic root of unity. we
dene the homology classes [c1], [c2], and [c3] by representative curves c1, c2, c3 that winds tightly
around two of these branch points but not the third. (only two of these classes are linearly independent,
though.) it is easy to see that the intersection form of these curves is given by




1 1
0

1 1

(19)

so that any two of the corresponding states are mutually non-local.

to construct the surfaces corresponding to bps states it is convenient to change variables from s and

u to x and y dened by the relations

s = (x + y)v
u = (x  y)v.

the equation for  then reads

(x + y)v = (x  y)v p(x  y)3  1(v)3/2 + o((v)2).

solving for y, we get

y = 

1

in these variables, the kahler form and the holomorphic two-form are

2px3  1(v)1/2 + o(v).

k = 2i|v|2 (dx  dx + dy  dy)
 = 4(v)2dy  dx.

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

we now consider a surface d with a boundary c on  that winds around the two branch points at
x =  and x =  , where  and   are two dierent cubic roots of unity, but not the third. the central

5

charge is independent of the exact form of d, so we can parametrize it by the real parameters  and 
such that 1    1 and 1    1 and let it be of the form

where the function x() obeys x(1) =  and x(1) =  . the central charge is then given by

x = x()

z = 4(v)2z

in particular, |z|  0 as v  0. notice that  in the limit v  0 has z2xz3 symmetry: y  y and
x  exp(2i/3)x, and is a at sheet: y = 0. the three surfaces d must break the z3 but have the z2
symmetry, and they must intersect with  orthogonally. the surface (24) has these properties, and it
will turn out that the surface that is asymptotically bps is really of this form. the induced metric on
such a surface is

where the components are

ds2 = 2|v|2(cid:0)|dx|2 + |dy|2(cid:1)

= gd2 + 2gdd + gd2,

g = 2|v|2|x()|2 + o((v)3)
g = o((v)3)

g =

|v|3

|px3()  1|2 + o((v)4).

the mass is then

(28)

comparing (25) and (28), we see that m/|z|  1 as v  0 provided that the function x() is chosen

so that the phase of

x()px3()  1

(29)

is independent of . we have not succeeded in nding such functions analytically, but they are not
dicult to approximate numerically. for example, if we take  = exp(2i/3) and   = exp 2i/3, we
nd that the central charge (25) is real, i.e. symmetric under complex conjugation. the same should be
true for the expression (29), from which follows that re x() is an even and im x() an odd function of
. we can then expand x() around  = 1 as

x() = exp(2i/3) + x(1)( + 1) + o(( + 1)2),

(30)

where the phase of x(1) equals 4/9. the curve x() can be well approximated by a rather at parabola.
rotating the conguration through 2/3 around the origin of the x-plane, we obtain the solutions for the
two other homology classes. hence we have found the three mutually non-local asymptotic bps states.
