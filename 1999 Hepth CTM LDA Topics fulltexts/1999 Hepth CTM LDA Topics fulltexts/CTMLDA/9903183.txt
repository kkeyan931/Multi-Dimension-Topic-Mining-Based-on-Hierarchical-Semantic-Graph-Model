(12) (13) integrating equation g obtain (there choice sign shall discuss below) substituting form (11) equation (9) using asymptotic expression (14) obtain result g = 4r + 2n log r + o(1). (14) e4rr2(n+1)(1 + |z|2)2 + o( 1 r2 ) = 0 (15) 6 subscripts denote partial dierentiation. coecient growing term (15) must therefore vanish nd equation satised p (p pz)z = 0. (16) equation p pz = 0 gives instanton solutions cip1 -model plane (see eg. ref ) clearly satisfy equation (16). furthermore, prove appendix, gives solutions equation (16). instanton solutions cip1 -model given p = f f |f|2 (17) f 2-component column vector whose entries holomorphic functions z. note multiplication f overall factor change projector p , f element cip1. substituting asymptotic behaviour (14) equation (12) obtain expression higgs eld two-sphere innity = i(2p 1).

(20) minor point, worth making comment choice sign made equation (14) taking square root integrating equation (13). opposite choice sign made following analysis nd boundary condition determined anti-holomorphic map. thus choice sign merely orientation determines whether wish monopoles correspond holomorphic anti-holomorphic rational maps. construction monopole rational map clear. choose rational map f (z) calculate associated projector (17). compute solution jarvis equation (9) satisfying boundary condition large r h exp(r(2 4p )). (21) obviously construction easy implement explicitly practice, since still requires solution nonlinear partial dierential equation. sense powerful say adhmn construction , reduces problem solving set nonlinear matrix ordinary dierential equations plus linear system ordinary dierential equations. advantage construction discussed data free, rational map allowed, whereas adhmn construction nahm data must satisfy complicated constraints (including aforementioned set nonlinear ordinary dierential equations). thus even using adhmn construction ex- plicit examples monopole solutions known. always inherent diculty associated solving monopole equations dierence two alter- native constructions whether main diculty resides performing construction specifying data upon construction performed. simplifying special cases able perform construction explicitly, easiest example rational map f = (1, z)t, corresponds spherically symmetric su(2) 1-monopole. case asymptotic behaviour, g(r) p (z, z), valid r substituting (11) jarvis equation gives following ordinary dierential equation prole function g + 2 r2 (1 eg) = 0. (22) large r boundary condition g 4r, together condition g(0) = 0, required h well-dened origin, determines unique solution (22) g = 2 log(2r/sinh2r).
