abstract

we propose that the eective eld theories of certain wrapped
d-branes are given by topological actions based on born-infeld the-
ory.
in particular, we present a born-infeld version of the abelian
donaldson-witten theory. we then consider wrapping d3 branes on
calibrated submanifolds and for the calabi-yau four-fold case, discuss
how the resulting theory could give rise to a born-infeld version of the
ampicheiral twisted n = 4 super yang-mills topological eld theory.

1 introduction

the subject of d-branes continues to occupy a central role in current inves-
tigations of m-theory in theoretical physics, with diverse applications. one
such application is in the area of topological quantum eld theories, where in
the past few years it has begun to be appreciated that these models can be
understood as arising as eective theories on the world-volumes of d-branes.
for example, the twisted n = 4 super yang-mills theories of [1, 2, 3, 4] can
be understood in this way as wrapped d3 branes on calibrated submani-
folds of compactication manifolds of restricted holonomy [5]. various other
topological eld theories in two, three and four dimensions were discussed
from this point of view in [6]. higher dimensional analogues of some of these
models were described in [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. (all of these models should be
more properly understood in terms of the euclidean e-branes of [12].).

generally, the eective theory on a d-brane world volume is given in terms
of a born-infeld theory, giving a non-linear version of the maxwell theory,
coupled to other elds. it is thus natural to expect that, when the brane is
wrapped upon manifolds to give eective theories which are topological, this
eective theory ought to be a topological eld theory based upon the born-
infeld action. we would like to investigate the structure of such theories
here. it is of course rather dicult to work with these non-linear models,
and we will not present complete actions; however, the results presented
here indicate how to formulate these theories.
in particular, in the pure
gauge sector, we will present a born-infeld version of the abelian donaldson-
witten theory. then, in the pure embedding sector, where one considers the
bosonic elds dening the embedding of the brane in the ambient space, we
will discuss the born-infeld analogue of the ampicheiral twisted n = 4 super
yang-mills theory, describing special lagrangian submanifolds in calabi-yau
4-fold compactications.

2 a topological born-infeld theory

in this section, we will present a topological eld theory which is a born-
infeld version of the abelian donaldson-witten theory. we will rst briey
review the latter in order to set the notation and motivate and simplify the
subsequent discussion.

2.1 the abelian donaldson-witten model

this theory in four dimensions contains the gauge eld ai (i = 1, .., 4),with
eld strength fij = 2[iaj], an anticommuting vector eld i, an anticom-
muting self-dual tensor ij ( ij := 1
klkl = ij), an anticommuting scalar
eld , and two commuting scalar elds , . we will use the conventions
of [13], and will use a condensed notation, where f 2 = f  f = f ijfij, 2 =
ii,    = [ij]ij, f f = f  f = f ij fij, etc.
the theory in at space has the lagrangian

2 ij

l =

1

f 2 +

1

2  i   + i   +

f f .

4

this lagrangian is invariant under the brst transformations

aj = ij
 = f + f
 = 2i

j = j,

(1)

(2)

these transformations are nilpotent, 2 = 0, up to a gauge transformation
and using the  equations of motion e :=  i

this lagrangian is brst exact up to the equations of motion e:

2( +g) = 0.

l = v +

where

v =

f   +

  .

the model is now dened on a manifold with metric gij. the lagrangian
becomes g times the lagrangian above, with the metric gij and its inverse
used to raise and lower indices. the brst symmetry is maintained. to
preserve the self-duality constraint upon  on a general manifold, one must
require that  transforms under metric variations gij as

ij =

the stress tensor of the model is dened by tij = 2g

where the notation v

does not include the metric variations of the eld . we will also use the
notation
onlygij to mean that in varying v by varying the metric, we only
consider the metric induced variation of  given in (5) above.

the fact that the stress tensor is brst exact implies that correlation
functions of brst invariant quantities are independent of identity connected
metric variations, and hence dene topological invariants. to calculate these
invariants one may use the metric independence and consider either the weak
or strong coupling limit. in the weak coupling limit, the action localises to
its minima. this restricts one to the moduli space of instantons, and the
invariants are certain intersection numbers on this moduli space. let us now
describe a generalisation of this model.

2.2 a born-infeld topological theory

the born-infeld lagrangian in four at dimensions is given by (including a
total derivative)

l =qdet(1 + f )  1 +

now we note the following identity

qdet(1 + f ) = 1 

1
4

f  f +

1

1
4

f  f .
f f+(cid:18)1 

1
2

(10)

(11)

h2(f )(cid:19) ,

f 2


where f := f  f , and h is a particular function of f . we have used the
fact that this term is positive to write this function as a square. the above
identity is most easily proven by going to a basis in which

f =

0
0
0

0
0
x
x 0
0
0
0
y
0
0 y 0



,

(12)

for some numbers x, y. in this basis qdet(1 + f ) =q(1 + x2)(1 + y2). ex-
panding this in powers of x and y, we have q(1 + x2)(1 + y2) = 1 + 1
2(x2 +
y2) + g(x, y), dening the function g. however, g(x, x) = 0, and g(x, y) is
invariant under the interchange of x and y, and also under the replacements
x  x or y  y. thus (x2  y2)2 must be a factor of g. thus we can
write
(13)

(x2 + y2)  (x2  y2)2h2(x, y),

q(1 + x2)(1 + y2) = 1 +

dening the function h. note that q(1 + x2)(1 + y2)  (1 + 1

2(x2 + y2))  0,
with equality only if x = y. re-expressing the equation above in terms of f
then yields the identity (11).

1
2

the born-infeld lagrangian (10) can then be written as

l = qdet(1 + f )  1 +

1

f  f

=

f 2
+f 2(f ),

(14)

where f 2 = 1  1
solutions, for which f+ = 0.

4 f 2


h2. thus the born-infeld action vanishes on instanton

5

now consider the transformations

aj = ij

 = 0
 = 0

j = j
 = 2i
 = f+f.

(15)

suppose that the  eld equations are e :=  1
4 (f+f ) = 0. then the
transformations above are nilpotent, up to a gauge transformation, and using
the  eld equations. the following lagrangian contains the born-infeld
lagrangian (10) and has the correct  eld equations to ensure the nilpotence
of the brst transformations (15):

2  i  .
moreover, this lagrangian is exact up to the eld equation e:

f  f+f 2 

  (f f ) +

1
2

l =

1
4

1
2

where

l = v +

1
2

  e

v =

1
4

(f  )f +

1
2

  .

(16)

(17)

(18)

we now put this theory on a four manifold with metric gij, as we did with
the abelian donaldson-witten theory above, using the metric gij to contract
indices and including g in the measure. the brst transformations remain
nilpotent on-shell and up to gauge transformations.

remarkably, the stress tensor of this model is brst exact :

tij = ij
v
gij  gijv +

ij = 2

  f fij

(19)

(fij := f

gij do not commute when acting on v here:



v

v
gij =

4

f  f+f fij.

(20)

6

the term on the right-hand side of this equation then combines with another
surviving term to give the last term in ij above. the proof of (19) is as
follows:

tij = 2

= 2

l

(21)

as with the donaldson-witten theory, the fact that the stress tensor is
brst exact implies that correlation functions of brst invariant quantities
are independent of metric variations and hence dene topological invariants.
the brst invariant quantities are the same as for the donaldson-witten
model. we also remark that we have not used the explicit form of the function
f in the above discussion, apart from its extremal properties.

3 calibrated submanifolds and topological

born-infeld actions

we have seen in the previous section that the pure four dimensional born-
infeld gauge theory has a topological analogue. one can understand why
one would expect such a theory by considering brane wrappings.
it was
argued in [5] that if one considered wrapping d3 branes on four dimensional
calibrated submanifolds of a seven or eight dimensional space (with three or
two further transverse dimensions), then the eective theories on the branes
are the topological eld theories arising from n = 4 super yang-mills theory.
an immediate reason to suspect this is that the eld contents are correct.
the transverse coordinates within the seven or eight dimensional space are

7

sections of the normal bundle of the world-volume, and can thus be non-
scalar elds in general. considering the cases where the four manifold is a
special lagrangian submanifold of a manifold of su(4) holonomy, a cayley
submanifold of a spin(7) eight manifold, and a co-associative submanifold of
a manifold of g2 holonomy, one nds that these four transverse coordinates
give precisely the required elds for the three twists of the n = 4 theory.

this analysis suggests that the full brane eective action, for such wrap-
pings, should be a born-infeld type action which is topological. if this is the
case, then the pure gauge sector should also be topological, localising on the
instanton moduli space. this must be related to the theory presented above
(after including higher-order fermionic terms in the action, as dictated by
supersymmetry). as further evidence, we must show that the other sectors
of the born-infeld action for these congurations are also of a topological
nature. in particular, if we consider the sector consisting of the transverse
coordinates just discussed, then one expected feature is that the born-infeld
actions for these elds should localise on the space of calibrated submanifolds
- ie the localisation conditions should be the embedding equations for the cal-
ibrated submanifolds. relevant properties of these calibrated spaces can be
found in [14]. in this reference, for the various calibrated submanifolds, the
authors show how to write the square of the volume form of the submanifold
as a sum of squares, with the vanishing of each expression which is squared
being equivalent to the requirement that the submanifold be calibrated.

consider the case of wrapping a d3 brane on a special lagrangian sub-
manifold of a calabi-yau four-fold compactication from ten dimensions.
the eective yang-mills theory on the brane is then the ampicheiral twisted
n = 4 super yang-mills theory, described in [4] for example. the full theory
should be a generalisation of this based upon the born-infeld theory. let us
suppose this is the case, and then restrict ourselves to considering the four
transverse elds, which form a one-form xi. the relevant lagrangian is then

qdet(ij + ixkjx k)  1.

(22)

the embedding equations for the submanifold to be special lagrangian are
[14]

[ixj] = 0
ixi  deti|i(x) = 0

8

(23)

where deti|i means the determinant of the matrix with the ith row and column
removed.

we now wish to see that the lagrangian (22) localises on solutions to
these equations. we will dene the matrix h to have elements hij = ixj.
for any 4  4 matrix m, we note the result
4xi=0

det(1 + m) =

ci(m)

(24)

where

c1(m) = (m)

(m 2) = m [i

i m j]

j

c2(m) =

c0(m) = 1,

(m)3 = m [i

(25)

we are using a shorthand where (m) = tr(m), (m 2) = tr(m 2), etc. the
abbreviation ci = ci(h) will be used in the following.

dene

d = det(1  ih) = (1  c2 + c4)  i(c1  c3).

notice that c2 and c4 are total derivatives:

c2 = i(cid:16)x [ijx j](cid:17)
c4 = i(cid:16)x [ijx jkx klx l](cid:17) .

(26)

(27)

to clarify the issues, we will rst simplify the analysis by considering
solutions of the rst equation in (23). then the hessian matrix h has el-
ements hij = ijx, for some function x. the embedding equations for
the submanifold to be special lagrangian can be written c1  c3 = 0, or
equivalently
(28)

d+  d = 0,

and the born-infeld lagrangian (22) is

l =qd+d.

9

(29)

now note the identity

qd+d = (1  c2 + c4) 

1
4

(d+  d)2 p 2,

(30)

where p 2 is a positive function of the ci. to prove (30), note that since
hij is symmetric, we can diagonalise it so that h = diag(x1, x2, x3, x4) for
some xi. then qdet(1 + h 2) =qq4
i ). expanding this in terms of
the symmetric polynomials ci gives (1  c2 + c4) + g(ci) for some function g.
however, g must vanish when c1 = c3. furthermore, it must also be invariant
under the replacements c1  c1, c3  c3. thus (c1  c3)2 factors g.
the remainder is negative since d+d  1
2 (d+ + d), and vanishes only if
d+ = d.

i=1(1 + x2

thus, from (30), the born-infeld lagrangian (22), when [ixj] = 0, can be
expressed as a total derivative plus a term which localises on the embedding
equations for the submanifold to be special lagrangian, ie c1  c3 = 0. the
relevant part of the topological action in this case contains the term ((c1
c3)p ), where the fermion  has the brst transformation  = (c1  c3)p
(this guarantees on-shell nilpotence).
now consider relaxing the restriction [ixj] = 0. we seek an expression
forqdet(1 + hh t ), with hij = ixj, as a total derivative plus terms which
dene i = ci(hh t + 2ia)  ci(hh t ) and  = p4
4xi=1

localise on the solutions of the embedding equations (23). split hij = ixj
into the sum of a symmetric matrix sij and antisymmetric matrix aij, and

det(1 + hh t ) = det|1 + ih|2 

i=1 i. then we have

i

= (1  c2 + c4)2 + (c1  c3)2 + ,

(31)

and some calculating yields

 = 2(a2)  2(s2)(a2) + 4(s2a2) + 4(x)(xa2)  (x)2(a2)  6(x 2a2)
(32)

+(x 2)(a2),

with x = hh t = s2  a2 + [a, s]. to express  as a sum of squares
minimised by solutions of (23), we turn to the results of [14] (this can also
form a basis for the curved space formulation). using their notation, the

10

relevant equation (equation (1.16) of this reference) is

|dz1dz2dz3dz4()|2 +

4x(i,j)=1|dzidzjk()|2 + |

1
2

k2()|2 = ||2.

(33)

the zi are complex coordinates on r8, k is the kahler form and  denes a
four-plane. to make the connection with the earlier approach, dene zi =
i=1 dzidzi

xi + ix i, so that dzi = (1 + ih)jidxj. then the kahler form k =p4

has components

kst = [(1 + ih)(1  ih t )][st] = 2iast.

then we nd the identity

24 =

1
2|aijaklijkl|2 +

4x(i,j)=1|(1 + ih)mi(1 + ih)njapqmnpq|2.

(34)

(35)

this is proved by a somewhat laborious comparison with (32). thus we come
to the result,

det(1 + hh t ) = 2 + c2 +

1
2

ijklijkl +

1
6

ijij,

(36)

where

 = 1  c2 + c4,
c = c1  c3,
ijkl = a[ijakl]

ij =

1
2

(1 + ih)mi(1 + ih)njapqmnpq.

performing an expansion in powers of , one can then write

(37)

(38)

qdet(1 + hh t ) =  + c2a + ijklijklb + ijijc,

for some (positive, if we take the positive square root of 2) functions a, b, c,
whose explicit form will not concern us presently. one can see from this
expression that the lagrangian localises on special lagrangian submanifolds
(those with c = ij = ijkl = 0).

11

turning to the formulation of a topological eld theory in this case, con-
sideration of the earlier formulation of the topological abelian dw the-
ory leads us to the introduction of anticommuting fermionic elds , ij
and ijkl (or  with ijkl = ijkl). the proposed brst variations are
 = ca, ij = ijb and ijkl = ijklc, and the corresponding terms
in the lagrangian are (ca + ijijb + ijklijklc). examination of
the stress tensor suggests that it is exact - for example, in the sector of the
theory containing the eld , we have  = ixi, xi = i,  i = 0. with
the lagrangian l = (ixi)  (ixi), up to equation of motion terms
one nds that the stress tensor is given by tij = (4(ixj)).

4 remarks

we have proposed in this letter that there are topological eld theories based
upon born-infeld theories, which generalise the known twisted supersym-
metric abelian gauge theories. for the twisted n = 2 case, we have given
a born-infeld generalisation of the abelian donaldson-witten theory and
shown explicitly that it is topological. for the born-infeld models corre-
sponding to the twisted n = 4 abelian theories, we have considered the
conjecture that these are the full eective theories of d3 branes wrapped
on certain calibrated submanifolds, for the case of special lagrangian four-
manifolds. this was supported by the localisation properties of the action
for this case, although the full result is not yet apparent. this work suggests
the general result in the n = 4 case that the born-infeld actions for the
transverse elds localise on the moduli space of calibrated submanifolds and
yield the relevant topological eld theories. an obvious candidate for the
full theory, including the higher order fermion terms, is the supersymmetric
born-infeld theory of [15], dened on the appropriate spaces. world-sheet
supersymmetry becomes brst invariance, and as already analysed in [16],
the conditions for supersymmetry are the embedding equations for the cal-
ibrated submanifolds. one would also expect a born-infeld version of the
dw theory which is non-linear in the fermions, from a similar source. ana-
logues of this in higher dimensions, being born-infeld versions of the theories
in [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], should also exist, being the theories describing wrapped
euclidean d-branes in these cases. the rather simple structure which is
emerging in this work suggests that these topological theories may have a

12

relatively simple formulation.

note added

as this work was being written up, the paper [17] appeared, which dis-
cusses a topological eld theory which localises on special lagrangian sub-
manifolds of a calabi-yau three fold. this must be related to a three dimen-
sional analogue of the four dimensional model discussed above.
