abstract: a general form of multi-channel bethe-salpeter equation is considered.
in contradistinction to the hitherto applied approaches, our coupled system of equa-
tions leads to the simultaneous solutions for all relativistic four-point green functions
(elastic and inelastic) appearing in a given theory. a set of relations which may be
helpful in approximate treatments is given. an example of extracting useful informa-
tion from the equations is discussed: we consider the most general trilinear coupling
of n dierent scalar elds and obtain  in the ladder approximation  closed ex-
pressions for the regge trajectories and their couplings to dierent channels in the
vicinity of  = 1. sum rules and an example containing non-obvious symmetry
are discussed.

keywords: phenomenological models, sum rules, integrable equations in
physics, nonperturbative eects.

this work has been supported in part under the german-polish agreement on bilateral scientic

1. introduction

the bethe-salpeter (bs) equation [1] has been widely applied in studies of two-body
scattering and bound-state problems (reviews can be found in [2]).
it is still the
most important tool for describing bound states in quantum eld theories. recent
applications include studies of quark-antiquark bound states by a combination of
the bs equation and the dyson-schwinger equations in four-dimensional euclidean
space [3, 4]. in addition, three-dimensional reductions of the bs equation are the
basis of models with eective potentials that also lead to surprisingly good predic-
tions [5]. studies of the bs equation in four-dimensional minkowski space on the basis
of the perturbation theory integral representation [6], which avoid the diculties of
performing a wick rotation [7], or attempts go beyond the ladder approximation [8]
have lead to interesting results.

in some of the recent applications of the bs equation to scattering processes,
the importance of a consistent treatment of coupled channels has been emphasized.
oller et al. [9] and oset et al. [10] have developed a method that combines a multi-
channel bs equation with chiral perturbation theory (chpt) [11] to describe scalar
mesons [9] and meson-nucleon scattering [10]. here, the interest in the interpretation
of scalar resonances stems from the possibility that some of these resonances may be

glueballs or at least mixtures of q q and gluonic states [12]. in this context one should
also mention the works of janssen et al. [13] and kaminski et al. [14], who employ
coupled-channel versions of the lippmann-schwinger equation. for the description
of meson-nucleon scattering, the inclusion of additional channels widens the range of
applicability of the lowest order chiral lagrangian [15, 10].

although these applications of the bs equation are phenomenologically quite
successful, none of them provides a fully relativistic description. in a one-channel
context, fully relativistic calculations were carried out for meson-meson scattering
in [16] and for meson-nucleon scattering in [17].

but the bs equation is also a valuable tool in axiomatic qft: it has been demon-
strated ([18, 19] and references therein) that the exact bethe-salpeter formalism in
the complex momentum space  together with its analytical dependence on both
complex energy and complex angular momentum  follows from the basic principles
of massive qft such as locality, lorentz covariance and the spectral condition. the
possibility of an extension of this rigorous approach to theories of qcd type with a
discrete spectrum of composite particles appearing as regge-type particles has been
recently announced [19].

having in mind these impressive eorts and developments it seems rather sur-
prising that the general form of the bs equation for two-body multi-channel problems
has not been discussed in the literature. we nd it therefore appropriate to start
such a discussion.

our contribution to this subject will be an investigation of some general prop-
erties of the solutions, leading to decomposition formulas for the case when the
bethe-salpeter kernel and/or the green functions can be subdivided into simpler
parts. as an illustration of the usefulness of the multi-channel formulation, we then
calculate the positions and couplings of regge poles in the vicinity of  = 1 in a
theory with general trilinear coupling of n dierent scalar elds in the ladder ap-
proximation. the treatment of this example is motivated not only by the fact that
scalar theories of this kind, e.g. the wick-cutkosky model or the fully massive 2
model are widely used [7, 8], but also because studies of the  = 1 singularity in
3 theory often serve as a starting point for investigations of the diractive region
in qcd (see e.g. [20]).

as a result we obtain some novel features of regge behaviour, in particular we
derive non-trivial sum rules for the scattering amplitudes in the dierent channels.
the multi-channel approach presented here may be helpful to solve the important
problem of understanding multi-channel hadron-hadron scattering as a consequence
of qcd. there exist many approaches which could be a good point of departure
for multi-channel bs predictions. what we have in mind are successful theories like
chpt [11], where eective actions with composite, hadronic degrees of freedom are
derived, e.g. [21, 22]. among these, the global colour model described in [22, 4]
respects the ultraviolet behaviour of qcd so that natural cutos appear in the

eective hadronic couplings. in this context our example of a super-renormalizable
theory with many channels involved may exhibit essential features of more realistic,
future applications.

2. the symmetric and reduced forms of the bethe-salpeter

equation

consider the non-truncated bethe-salpeter green function bs:

bs(a, x1; b, x2|a, x

1; b; x

2) = h0|t[a(x1)b(x2)a(x

1)b(x

2)]|0i 

(2.1)

h0|t[a(x1)b(x2)]|0ih0|t[a(x

1)b(x

2)]|0i .

here the elds a(x) may be bosons, fermions or ghosts  formally, we use one
multicomponent eld and the indices a contain the information on its boson, fermion
or ghost nature. the function bs has the following symmetries:

1; b, x

bs(a, x1; b, x2|a, x

1; b, x
2)
2; a, x
1) ,
(2.3)
1; b, x
bs(a, x1; b, x2|a, x
2|a, x1; b, x2) , (2.4)
ab = 1 for a, b both being fermion (or ghost) elds, otherwise it is +1.

ab bs(b, x2; a, x1|a, x
ab bs(a, x1; b, x2|b, x
aa p
bb bs(a, x

where p
the symmetry (2.4) results from the fact that the full propagator

2) = p
= p
2) = p

1; b, x

ab p

ba p

(2.2)

(a, x1; b, x2) = p

ab (b, x2; a, x1) = h0|t[a(x1)b(x2)]|0i

(2.5)

in the subtracted term in (2.1) vanishes unless both a and b are either both
fermions or bosons. but besides this, the propagator does not need to be diago-
nal in the discrete indices.
in such a manner we admit both spinor propagators
and the eventual mixing of dierent elementary elds. with (2.5) we can relate the
matrix for the truncated, connected 4-point function

m(a, x1; b, x2|a, x

1; b, x

2) = h0|t[a(x1)b(x2)a(x

1)b(x

2)]|0i|trunc, conn

to bs through

where

bs = g + g  m  g ,

g(a, x1; b, x2|a, x

1; b, x

2) = p

ab (a, x1; a, x
+ (a, x1; b, x

1)(b, x2; b, x
1, x
2)(b, x2; a

2) +
1) ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

and the  product is dened as
1; b, x

(g  m)(a, x1; b, x2|a, x

2) =

1

2xc,d z d4y1 d4y2 g(a, x1; b, x2|c, y1; d, y2) 

 m(c, y1; d, y2|a, x

1; b, x

2) .

(2.9)

3

the factor 1/2 in (2.9) appears because g and m fulll the same symmetry rela-
tions (2.2)(2.4) as bs and hence all terms in the sum are counted twice.
if the
momentum-space green functions are normalized like

m(a, k1; b, k2|a, k

1; b, k

2) = z d4x1 d4x2 d4x

then the matricial form (2.7) can also be used in 4-momentum space, with the symbol
 denoting

in momentum space, m contains an overall  function,

and if the transition matrix is dened by s = 1  it , then m, taken at k

2 = k1 + k2, denotes an o-shell extrapolation of the scattering amplitude for the
process with outgoing particles a and b with momenta k1 and k2, respectively, and
incoming particles a(k

 functions:
g(a, k1; b, k2|a, k

with (a; b, k1) =r d4x eik1x(a, x; b, 0).

2.1 the symmetric form of the bs equation

the matrices bs, g and m fulll the symmetry relations (2.2)(2.4). this leads to
the symmetric form of the bethe-salpeter equation:
bs = g + g  b  bs ,

(2.14)

and

m = b + b  g  m .

(2.15)

in these equations, b is the two-particle irreducible (for any two particles involved)
part of m and also possesses the symmetries (2.2)(2.4). the symmetry (2.4) leads
to the alternative forms

bs = g + bs  b  g

and

m = b + m  g  b

(2.16)

of the bs equation.
m{b, g}, then the solution of (2.14) can be written analogously:

if we symbolically denote the solution of (2.15) by m =

bs = m{g, b} .
this will be useful for the discussion of the general relations.

m = m{b, g} ,

(2.17)

2.2 the reduced form of the bs equation

in applications one may encounter forms of the bs equation that dier from the
symmetric ones (2.14) and (2.15). these are special cases of a reduced form of the
bs equation, i.e. forms where the bs equation is simplied for the price of loosing
the explicitly symmetric shape.

the general transition may be described as follows: let gr and br be arbitrary

but satisfying

g = gr(a, x1; b, x2|a, x
b = br(a, x1; b, x2|a, x

1; b, x
1; b, x

ab gr(a, x1; b, x2|b, x
ab br(a, x1; b, x2|b, x

2; a, x
2; a, x

1) ,
1) .

(2.18)

then (2.14) and (2.15) can be transformed into

bs = g + gr  br  bs ,

m = b + br  gr  m

(2.19)

and similarly for (2.16), with the  product now being dened as

 =xc,d z d4y1 d4y2 ,

(2.20)

i.e. without the factor 1/2 of (2.9). the forms (2.19) do not t into the general
relations (2.14) and (2.15). however, looking into the iteration procedure, we nd

bs =

with

1

1  gr  br  g =  r

bs + p

ab r

bs ((a, x

1)  (b, x

2))

thus, we can deal with the equation

 r
bs =

1  gr  br  gr .

bs = gr + gr  br   r

m r =

(2.24)

the functions gr and br are not uniquely determined. let us add that in typical
ladder approximations the reduced form of the bs equation is in fact used. in these
cases the choice of suitable gr and br has been always implicitly made.

3. general relations

the basic principles of qft ensure [18, 19] that the scattering matrix function m in
the physical region can be obtained from the solution of eq. (2.15) in the euclidean
region by analytic continuation in the invariant variables. thus, if we had complete
knowledge of the matrix functions b and g in the euclidean region, and if we would
be able to exactly solve eq. (2.15) in this region, we could obtain complete information
on m in the physical region. generally none of these conditions is met and one has
to rely on soundness of chosen scheme of approximations. having this in mind we
shall write below a few general relations which in our opinion may be helpful at least
as a consistency check of approximations. we will throughout this section use the
notation (2.14) and (2.15) for the symmetric form of the bs equation, but in view
of (2.23) and (2.24) these relations can of course also be used for the reduced forms.

to begin with, consider the solution of (2.15) for given b, g:

m{b, g} =

1

1  b  g  b = b 

1

1  g  b

.

(3.1)

this solution, treated as a functional of b and g has the following interesting prop-
erty: for arbitrary g1 one has

m{b, g} = m {m{b, g  g1}, g1} .

(3.2)

this equality has been found useful for the one-channel problem long time ago [23].
in fact eq. (3.2) comes as an answer to the following question: what is the relation
between pairs (b, g) and (b1, g1) if both of them lead to the same m:

m{b, g} = m{b1, g1} .

(3.3)

j

e
p

(

using eqs. (3.1) and (3.3) we get b1 = b + b  [g  g1]  b1, i.e. from (2.15) we
have b1 = m{b, g  g1}; inserting it into (3.3) we end up with relation (3.2).

equation (3.2) leads to the following formula for g = g1 + g2 + g3 +    + gn:
(3.4)

m{b, g} = m {. . . m{m{m{b, g1}, g2}, g3}, . . . , gn} .

it is natural to ask whether similar formula holds in a situation when we sub-
divide b instead of g. the answer is yes, once we notice relation (2.7) between
the o-shell scattering amplitude m{b, g} and the non-truncated 4-point green
function bs = m{g, b}:
m{b, g} = b + b  m{g, b}  b ,
inserting (3.4) with g  b in r.h.s. of (3.5) we get for b =pn

m{g, b} = g + g  m{b, g}  g . (3.5)

m{b, g} = b + b  m {. . . m{m{m{g, b1}, b2}, b3}, . . . , bn}  b .

k=1 bk

(3.6)

the formulae (3.4) and (3.6) may provide useful schemes of approximation for
subdivision of green functions and irreducible bethe-salpeter kernels. of course in
principle these two schemes can be combined. let us mention that approaches with
suitable divisions of g and/or b have already been useful both in the case of qed
applications [24] and for deriving rigorous results concerning threshold behaviour in
qft [25]. the essential relation found in [25] exhibits convenience of using half-
truncated amplitudes and kernels bh , mh :

mh = m{b, g}  g ,

bh = b  g .

for this case formula (2.15) yields mh = m{bh , 1}. moreover, from eq. (3.5)

m{1, bh} = 1 + m{bh, 1} .

(3.7)

(3.8)

using division of bh in m{1, bh} together with eqs. (3.2) and (3.8) we recover in
our notation bros-iagolnitzer relation (compare text before [25, eq. (5)]):

1 + m  g = (1 + m   g)  (1  b  g  (1 + m   g))1 ,

(3.9)

where m = m{b, g}, m  = m{b  b, g}.

4. arbitrary trilinear coupling scheme

we shall pass now to a problem where the use of the multi-channel approach itself can
be clearly exhibited and discussed, namely to the example of a theory with general
trilinear couplings of scalar elds. models of this kind may have phenomenological
applications when combined with eective, qcd-inspired couplings [11, 21, 22].

the most general trilinear coupling of n hermitian scalar elds i (i = 1, . . . , n)

is of the form:

lint(x) =

1
3!

n

xi,j,k=1

cijk:i(x)j(x)k(x):

(4.1)

the totally symmetric symbol cijk denotes the coupling constants.

let us start with the o-shell amplitude:

im r(i2, q2; i4, q4|i1, q1; i3, q3) = (2)44(q1 + q3  q2  q4)mi1i2

i3i4(ptot, q13, q24)

(4.2)

with ptot = q1 + q3 = q2 + q4 and qij = qiqj
2

.

in the reduced form (2.24) of the bethe-salpeter equation in the ladder approx-

imation, the matrix gr can be chosen to be

(4.12)

then the bethe-salpeter equation for the partial wave amplitudes is again of the
form (2.24),

m = b + b  g  m ,

with the solution

m = b 

1

1  g  b

= m{b, g} .

(4.13)

(4.14)

here, one may split b according to (4.9) into terms corresponding to the exchange

b(r)
i(i,j)i(k,l) = 2cirkcjrlq(r). in this way we are naturally led to a decomposition
of the form (3.6). thus, m can be written as

m = b + b  mn. . . m{m{g, b(1)

 }, b(2)

 }, . . . , b(n )

 o  b .

(4.16)

this form of the solution may be useful for numerical studies of m because the
contributions of the various exchanged particles are now disentangled in a system-
atic way.

we will in the following focus our interest on regge trajectories near  = 1;
such a choice seems sound once we recall that studies of this singularity in 3 theory
(i.e. only c111 6= 0 in eq. (4.1)) often were and still are a point of departure for studies
of the diractive region in qcd (see, e.g. [20]). in our discussion we shall not go
beyond the approximation of leading logarithms which means that  in analogy with
the one-channel case [26]  q can be replaced by its leading -plane singularity,
q()  1/( + 1). in this case, the matrix b becomes constant,

(4.18)

since c does not depend on the variables that are integrated by the  product, (4.18)
simplies to give a usual matrix equation: one nds

c  g  c =

cfc

and so on, with the diagonal matrix f given by

fi(i,j)i(k,l)(w ) = 2i(i,j)i(k,l)z dq0 d|~q| gi

j(ptot, q)  i(i,j)i(k,l)fi(i,j)(w ) .

therefore, the solution of the bethe-salpeter equation is

m = 2c

 + 1  fc

.

(4.21)

here everything is to be understood as a matrix relation. we will in the following
study the high-energy behaviour of the amplitude in the crossed channel. to do this,
we dene the symmetric matrix c = fcf and write (4.21) in the form

m = 2f

1 c

f

.

1

 + 1  c

(4.22)

we shall limit our considerations to p 2
tot  0 so that fij comes out to be real and
positive. since c is symmetric, we can diagonalize it: let v[i] denote the normalized
eigenvectors,

cv[i] = [i]v[i] ,

i = 1, . . . , n 2 ,

thus, the regge trajectories are given by

[i] = pole = [i]  1 .

with (4.24) we are ready to use the mandelstam-sommerfeld-watson transforma-
tion [26, 27, 28] to obtain the high-energy amplitude in the crossed channel (t =
(q1 + q3)2 = w 2 xed, s = (q1  q2)2  ), with the result

the states v[i] are eigenstates of the hermitian matrix c, thus they are orthogonal.

this is, however, no longer true for the states f
states we introduce the states

1

u[i] = fv[i]

with

u[i]f1u[j] = ij .

(4.27)

the only matrix elements of m = mpoles in this base that are non zero are u[i]mu[i], i =
1, . . . , n 2. the high-energy behaviour of each of these matrix elements is governed
by only one trajectory,

u[i]mu[j] = ij[i]s[i]1 ,

(4.28)

although the states u[i] are in general not orthogonal. equation (4.28) leads to the
following sum rules for the scattering amplitudes:

n 2

xi,j=1

v[i]

v[j]

j pfifj mij = ij[i]s[i]1 .

note that some of these relations simplify whenever [i] = 0. in this case,

mu[i] = 0 ,

for

[i] = 0

(4.29)

(4.30)

(or equivalently cu[i] = 0), i.e. states corresponding to xed regge singularities are
transparent in our approximation.

as an illustration, let us consider the interaction

li =

g1

g2

(4.31)

which is a special case of (4.1) for n = 2, 1 = , 2 = , and c112 = c121 = c211 = g1,
c222 = g2, c111 = c122 = c212 = c221 = 0. let i(1, 1) = 1, i(2, 2) = 2, i(1, 2) = 3, and
i(2, 1) = 4, then the matrix c is block diagonal due to the symmetry of the total
lagrangian with respect to   ,
c =(cid:18) g2

c =(cid:18) g1g2

where, e.g. m,, is short for m((~p1, ), (~p2, )  (~p3, ), (~p4, )).

of course, these relations are only valid in the regge limit s  , t xed, and
apply only to regge behaviour, so that a vanishing combination of amplitudes means
that this combination does not exhibit regge behaviour.

in the example, eigenvalues [i] can vanish only for g2 = g1. if, say, g2 = g1 (i.e.

1(f1 + f2), [2] = 0, [3] = 2g2

1f3, [4] = 0), the relations (4.36) simplify to

[1] = g2

m,, = m,, = m,, = g2
m,, = m,, = m,, = g2

1s[1]1 ,

1s[3]1 .

(4.37)

if moreover, we assumed m = m, then [1] = [3] and all the amplitudes standing
on the l.h.s. of (4.37) are the same. this symmetry can be traced back to the fact
that for g1 = g2  g we can rewrite eq. (4.31) as a sum of two separate 3

 terms

lint(g1 = g2  g) =

g
2

3!(cid:2):3

+: + :3

:(cid:3) ,

(4.38)

where  =   . thus, in the special case m = m the total lagrangian can be
separated into two of identical form and hence the complete symmetry follows.

5. concluding remarks

the general results of sections 2 and 3 provide a clear and general scheme of dealing
with various approximations in the multi-channel bethe-salpeter equation. more-
over, the results derived in section 4 show that the multi-channel bethe-salpeter
formalism is tractable and leads to non-trivial physical relations, e.g. sum rules for
scattering amplitudes. in our opinion, future applications may include the treatment
of the e+e and  channels of parapositronium, and the bethe-salpeter analysis
of hadronic multi-channel processes hitherto treated not fully relativistic.
in the
latter case theoretical input could be provided by eective couplings derived from
qcd [11, 21, 22].
