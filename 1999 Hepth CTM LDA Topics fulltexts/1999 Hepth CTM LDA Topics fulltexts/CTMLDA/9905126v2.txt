abstract

this paper studies the dual form of witten-dijkgraaf-verlinde-verlinde (wdvv)

equations in n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory by applying a duality trans-

formation to wdvv equations. the dual wdvv equations called in this paper

are non-linear dierential equations satised by dual prepotential and are found to

have the same form with the original wdvv equations. however, in contrast with

the case of weak coupling calculus, the perturbative part of dual prepotential itself

does not satisfy the dual wdvv equations. nevertheless, it is possible to show that

the non-perturbative part of dual prepotential can be determined from dual wdvv

equations, provided the perturbative part is given. as an example, the su(4) case is

presented. the non-perturbative dual prepotential derived in this way is consistent

to the dual prepotential obtained by dhoker and phong.

i. introduction

we have had a rich harvest since the seed of approach using a riemann surface for the low

energy eective description of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory was sowed by seiberg and

witten.1,2 for example, instanton eect3 for prepotentials obtained by using a riemann surface4

showed a good agreement to the prediction of instanton calculus,5,6,7 integrable structure behind

seiberg-witten solutions was discussed in terms of whitham theory,8 and the approach taken by

seiberg and witten was extended to the case of higher dimensional gauge theories.9 of course,

there are a lot of other interesting developments, but the best way to understand uniformly all

these aspects of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories may be encoded in the language of witten-

dijkgraaf-verlinde-verlinde (wdvv) equations10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 because they can widely cover var-

ious aspects of prepotentials.

in general, wdvv equations hold in various dimensional gauge theories15,18 and (in the case

not including massive matter hypermultiplets) they are of the form

(fi)(fk)1(fj) = (fj)(fk)1(fi),

(1.1)

where f is the prepotential, (fi)jk := 3f /aiajak are matrix notations, ai are regarded as

periods of seiberg-witten dierential and the indices run from 1 to the rank of the gauge group.

(1.1) was extensively investigated at perturbative level,14,15,16,17 but not so much about the non-

perturbative eect obtainable from (1.1) are known.19

on the other hand, the study of strong coupling region in view of wdvv equations are not

found in literatures. according to the electro-magnetic duality of seiberg and witten,1,2 in the

strong coupling region where charged particles become massless, the role of periods ai and their

magnetic duals adj := f /aj are exchanged. if this duality is applied to third-order derivatives of

prepotential, we will obtain non-linear equations like (1.1) written in terms of dual periods. the

equations obtained in this way will make it possible to derive the strong coupling prepotentials in

the standpoint of wdvv equations. the aim of the paper is to study such non-linear equations.

this paper is organized as follows. in sec. ii, we apply the duality transformation to third-order

derivatives of prepotential and by using (1.1) we derive non-linear equations for dual prepotential.

these equations are found to have the same form with (1.1), so we call them as dual wdvv

equations throughout the paper. in sec. iii, we consider the relation among dual prepotentials

2

and the dual wdvv equations.

in particular, we rstly show in su(r + 1) gauge theory that

the dual perturbative prepotential20,21 do not satisfy dual wdvv equations. of course, in order

to determine non-perturbative part, the perturbative part must be required, so we provide it as

input data. however, as the general case is slightly intractable, we present the calculation of non-

perturbative part of dual prepotential in su(4) gauge theory as an example. we can nd that the

non-perturbative dual prepotential which is consistent to that found by dhoker and phong21 is

available from dual wdvv equations. sec. iv is a brief summary.

ii. the dual wdvv equations

in this section, we prove the existence of dual form of wdvv equations for all known models

with wdvv equations (1.1). our method here is based on the action of duality transformation for

prepotential.

to begin with, let us consider how the third-order derivatives of prepotential transform under

the electro-magnetic duality. in general, it is well-known that in the case of rank r gauge group the

full electro-magnetic duality group is a subgroup of sp(2r, z),22,23,24,25,26,27 and the generator

s :=

0

i

i

0

 ,

(2.1)

where i and 0 are the unit matrix and zero matrix of size r  r, respectively, induces the exchange

of periods and their duals and therefore the inversion of the eective coupling constant. note that

in order to see a strong coupling behavior it is enough to take into account of only (2.1) and is not

necessary to consider all actions of duality group.

in fact, the periods transform under (2.1) as



adi

 := s
eadi
eaj

adi

aj

 .

= 

1

adj
ai

=

ij

,

(2.2)

(2.3)

then the eective coupling constants transform as

ij :=

adi
aj

=

2f
aiaj

 dij :=

diate to see that

3

where dij are the dual eective coupling constants. from this transformation property, it is imme-

ij! al

=

rxl=1

(fi)jl

dlk.

(2.4)

note that in (2.4) the repeated indices i and j are not summed.

now, suppose that eadi are given by dierentiations of some function fd (the dual prepotential)

fd

= 

fd
adi

.

eadi :=

(fdi)jk =

(fi)jl(d)lk,

eai
rxl=1

= 

3fd

adiadj adk

3fd

eaieajeak

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

then the relation (2.4) can be rewritten as

where

(fdi)jk :=

and (d)lk := dlk are matrix notations and the overall factor is ignored because it is not necessary

in the following discussions. note that the right hand side of (2.6) is simply a matrix multiplication.

with the aid of (2.6), it is easy to see that

(fdi)pl(fdk)1

lm(fdj )mn = (fi)pl(fk)1

lm(fj)mq(d)qn,

(2.8)

where (fdk)1

lm mean the (l, m) components of (fdk)1 and we have ignored the determinants of

(fk) and (d) arising from (fdk)1 because they can be summarized into an overall factor. thus

from (2.8) and (1.1), we can obtain the dual form of wdvv equations

(fdi)(fdk)1(fdj ) = (fdj )(fdk)1(fdi).

(2.9)

since (2.9) is written by dual variables, we often refer (2.9) as dual wdvv equations throughout

the paper.

from our construction, it would be obvious that there also exist dual wdvv equations if wdvv

equations (1.1) hold.

iii. dual prepotential available from dual wdvv equations

the dual wdvv equations (2.9) take the same form with (1.1), but the study of dual prepo-

tential in strong coupling region from a standpoint of (2.9) is slightly dierent from that in weak

coupling calculus.

4

to see this, rstly, let us recall the prepotentials in weak coupling region. in this case, the wdvv

equations were satised even at perturbative level.14,15,17,18 namely, the perturbative prepotentials

can be obtained by solving wdvv equations at perturbative level as was explicitly shown by braden

et al.18 in the case of su(4) gauge theory.

a. perturbative dual prepotential of su(r + 1) gauge theory

in the case of strongly coupled theory, on the other hand, the dual perturbative prepotentials

themselves do not satisfy (2.9), thus in this case the dual wdvv equations do not hold at pertur-

bative level.

to check this, let us recall the dual prepotential of su(r + 1) gauge theory obtained from study

of period integrals.20,21 according to the result, the perturbative part of dual prepotential fd,per

can be represented by a single function f

fd,per =

f (adi).

rxi=1

(3.1)

as the argument of f is single, the matrices (fdi) in (2.9) become singular, e.g., the only non-zero

entry of (fd1) is (fd1)11 = 3fd,per/a3

d1. this indicates that we can not determine fd,per from

(2.9) even if we follow the method of braden et al..18

b. non-perturbative dual prepotential of su(4) gauge theory

then, what happens when the non-perturbative part is introduced? in this case, we add the

non-perturbative part fd,non to fd,per and consider

where

fd = fd,per + fd,non,

fd,non =

fd,kk

xk=1

(3.2)

(3.3)

and 1  su(r + 1) is the dynamically generated mass scale of su(r + 1) gauge theory. in (3.3),

the coecients fd,k are functions in dual variables adi.

5

as it is not easy to study the general case of r, we restrict r = 3 case in the following discussion.

in this case, substituting (3.2) into (2.9), we can obtain nothing from the coecient of 0, but we

can nd from the coecient of 1

it is interesting to notice that in the weak

coupling calculus of su(4) gauge theory one-instanton prepotential satises a complicated equation19

while in the present case the equation for fd,1 is very simple.

to calculate fd,k explicitly, the perturbative prepotential must be xed, although it is not

available directly from (2.9) in contrast with the weak coupling study. for this reason, we must

provide it as the input data. actually, the perturbative part is known to be calculated as20,21

f (adi) = a2

di ln

adi

su(4)

,

(3.6)

where we have ignored the overall numerical factor and the normalization of su(4) in (3.6). in

this case, the third-order derivatives of (3.6) do not vanish, so the general solution to (3.4) is easily

calculated to give

fd,1 = f1(ad2, ad3) + f2(ad1, ad3) + f3(ad1, ad2),

(3.7)

where fi are arbitrary functions.

for fd,2, on the other hand, from (3.5) and (3.7), we get

fd,2 =

1

2z (ad12

12f3 + ad212

+g1(ad2, ad3) + g2(ad1, ad3) + g3(ad1, ad2),

(3.8)

where we have again used arbitrary functions gi.

6

here, let us notice that the scaling relation for fd,k is given by

3xi=1

adi

fd,k
adi

= (2 + k)fd,k

(3.9)

which follows from dimensional analysis. the scaling relation28,29,30,31,32 for dual prepotential21,33,34

was a basic tool of the study of strong coupling expansion presented by dhoker and phong.21

of course, though there are various functions satisfying (3.9), we can easily see that all monomials

of degree 3 for (3.7) are also solutions to (3.9) by following to the method presented in weak coupling

study of wdvv equations,19 thus we get

fd,1 =

3xi=1

(3.10)

where si and ci are integration constants. the function form of (3.10) is consistent to the result

of su(4) gauge theory obtained by dhoker and phong,21 but note that the integration constants

should be determined by other approaches. a priori, we do not know explicit values for them in

view of (2.9).

in a similar manner, we can determine fd,2 from (3.8) as

fd,2 =

di + c1c2a2

d1ad2ad3 + c3c4ad1a2

d2ad3 + c5c6ad1ad2a2

where ti are integration constants, the braces mean any linear combination of the elements and we

have assumed that gi consist of polynomials.

remark: in general, it is known from explicit examples4,33,35 that fd,k are represented by

polynomials in dual periods.

iv. summary

in this paper, we have considered the consequence of electro-magnetic duality transformation

for the wdvv equations (1.1) and derived the dual wdvv equations (2.9) satised by dual prepo-

tentials. the dual wdvv equations are turned out to have the same form with the original wdvv

equations, but the perturbative part of dual prepotential do not satisfy dual wdvv equations.

however, we have derived the non-perturbative dual prepotential in pure su(4) gauge theory as an

example by appropriately introducing perturbative part and following to the method to get solutions

7

developed in weak coupling calculus.19 in fact, we have found that there is the non-perturbative pre-

potential in strong coupling region which is consistent to the result of dhoker and phong.21 from

this result, it is important to notice that we can study both weak and strong coupling prepotentials

in the standpoint of wdvv equations.

as for an another direction to study the strong coupling region, it may be interesting to try to

develop the topological string theoretic interpretation36 in strong coupling region and to search a

connection to (2.9). more detailed study should be expected in the future.
