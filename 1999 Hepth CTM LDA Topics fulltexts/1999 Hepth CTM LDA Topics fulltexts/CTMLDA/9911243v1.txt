abstract

we consider supersymmetric yangmills theory on rs 1s 1. in particular, we
choose one of the compact directions to be lightlike and another to be spacelike.
since the sdlcq regularization explicitly preserves supersymmetry, this theory is
totally nite, and thus we can solve for bound state wave functions and masses
numerically without renormalizing. we present the masses as functions of the
longitudinal and transverse resolutions and show that the masses converge rapidly
in both resolutions. we also study the behavior of the spectrum as a function of the
coupling and nd that at strong coupling there is a stable, well dened spectrum
which we present. we also nd several unphysical states that decouple at large
transverse resolution. there are two sets of massless states; one set is massless
only at zero coupling and the other is massless at all couplings. together these sets
of massless states are in onetoone correspondence with the full spectrum of the
dimensionally reduced theory.

1 introduction

recently, there has been considerable progress in understanding the properties of strongly

coupled gauge theories with supersymmetry [1, 2, 3]. in particular, there are a number

of supersymmetric gauge theories that are believed to be interconnected through a web

of strong-weak coupling dualities. although existing evidence for these dualities is en-

couraging, there is still an urgent need to address these issues at a more fundamental

level. ideally, we would like to solve for the bound states of these theories directly, and

at any coupling.

of course, solving a eld theory from rst principles is typically an intractable task.

nevertheless, it has been known for some time that 1 + 1 dimensional eld theories can

be solved from rst principles via a straightforward application of dlcq (see [4] for a

review).

in more recent times, a large class of supersymmetric gauge theories in two

dimensions was studied using a supersymmetric form of dlcq (or sdlcq), which is

known to preserve supersymmetry [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14].

we have recently been able to extend the sdlcq algorithms to solve higher-dimensional

theories [5]. one important dierence between two-dimensional and higher-dimensional

theories is the phase diagram induced by variations in the gauge coupling. the spectrum

of a 1 + 1 dimensional gauge theory scales trivially with respect to the gauge coupling,

while a theory in higher dimensions has the potential of exhibiting a complex phase struc-

ture, which may include a strong-weak coupling duality. ref. [5] seemed to provide hints

of the latter. it is therefore interesting to study the phase diagram of gauge theories in
d  3 dimensions.

towards this end, we consider three dimensional su(nc) n = 1 super-yang-mills
compactied on the space-time r  s 1  s 1. the calculations are all done in the large
nc limit. in particular, we compactify the light-cone coordinate x on a light-like circle
via dlcq, and wrap the remaining transverse coordinate x on a spatial circle. we are
able to solve for bound state wave functions and masses numerically by diagonalizing the

discretized light-cone supercharge. we have shown that the sdlcq procedure extends

naturally to 2 + 1 dimensions, resulting in an exactly supersymmetric spectrum.

the contents of this paper are organized as follows. in section 2, we formulate su(nc)
n = 1 super-yang-mills dened on the compactied space-time r  s 1  s 1. explicit
expressions are given for the light-cone supercharges, which are then discretized via the

sdlcq procedure. quantization of the theory is carried out by imposing canonical

2

(anti-)commutation relations for boson and fermion elds. we also discuss the two dis-

crete symmetries of the theory in this section. in section 3, we present our numerical

results. we present plots of the spectrum as a function of the longitudinal and transverse

resolution and show that it convergences very rapidly in both. we plot the spectrum also

as a function of the coupling and nd a very stable strong-coupling spectrum. we identify

several states that appear to be unphysical and disappear at high transverse resolutions.

finally we discuss the infrared spectrum of the theory and present evidence that it is

entirely determined by the dimensionally reduced theory. we conclude our analysis with

a discussion of our results and a list of important related future projects in section 4.

2 light-cone quantization and sdlcq

discrete light cone quantization has proven to be a very powerful method of studying

the mass spectra of various theories [4]. it is well known that in 1 + 1 dimension one

can dene a new version of dlcq which preserves supersymmetry [7, 14].

in higher

dimensions a supersymmetric prescription is also possible [5]. we begin by introducing

light-cone coordinates x = (x0  x1)/2, and compactifying the x coordinate on a

light-like circle. in this way, the conjugate light-cone momentum k+ is discretized. to
discretize the remaining (transverse) momentum k = k2, we may compactify x = x2
on a spatial circle. of course, there is a signicant dierence between the discretized
light-cone momenta k+ and the discretized transverse momenta k; namely, the light-
cone momentum k+ is always positive, while k may take on positive or negative values.
the positivity of k+ is a key property that is exploited in dlcq calculations; for any
given light-cone compactication, there are only a nite number of choices for k+ 
the total number depending on how nely we discretize the momenta. the resolution

of the discretization is usually characterized by a positive integer k, which is called
the harmonic resolution [15, 16]; for a given choice of k, the light-cone momenta k+
are restricted to positive integer multiples of p +/k, where p + is the total light-cone
momentum of a state. in the context of two-dimensional theories, this implies a nite

number of fock states [15].

in the case of interest here, we include an additional transverse dimension, and the

number of fock states is no longer nite, since there is an arbitrarily large number of

transverse momentum modes dened on the transverse spatial circle. thus, an additional

truncation of the transverse momentum modes is required to render the total number

3

of fock states nite and the problem numerically tractable. this truncation procedure,
which is characterized by a transverse resolution t, is analogous to the truncation of k+
imposed by the harmonic resolution k. thus the transverse momentum k range from
zero to  2t

l , where l is the size of the transverse circle.

let us now review these ideas in the context of a specic super-yang-mills theory. we
start with (2 + 1)-dimensional n = 1 super-yang-mills theory dened on a space-time
with one transverse dimension compactied on a circle:

hij(x, x), kl(y, y)i = nij(x, x), kl(y, y)o =

(x  y)(x  y)iljk.
(10)

using these relations one can check the supersymmetry algebra

{q+, q+} = 22p +,

{q, q} = 22p ,

{q+, q} = 4p.

(11)

we will consider only states which have vanishing transverse momentum, which is
possible since the total transverse momentum operator is kinematical1. on such states,
the light-cone supercharges q+ and q anticommute with each other, and the super-
symmetry algebra is equivalent to the n = (1, 1) supersymmetry of the dimensionally
reduced (i.e. two-dimensional) theory [7]. moreover, in the p = 0 sector, the mass
squared operator m 2 is given by m 2 = 2p +p .

as we mentioned earlier, in order to render the bound state equations numerically

tractable, the transverse momentum of partons must be truncated. first, we introduce

the fourier expansion for the elds  and , where the transverse space-time coordinate
x is periodically identied:

(14)

we now perform the truncation procedure; namely, in all sums over the transverse mo-
menta ni appearing in the above expressions for the supercharges, we restrict summation
to the following allowed momentum modes: ni = 0,1...t . note that this prescription
is symmetric, in the sense that there are as many positive modes as there are negative

ones. in this way we retain parity symmetry in the transverse direction.

how does such a truncation aect the supersymmetry properties of the theory? note

rst that an operator relation [a, b] = c in the full theory is not expected to hold in

the truncated formulation. however, if a is quadratic in terms of elds (or in terms of

creation and annihilation operators), one can show that the relation [a, b] = c implies

[atr, btr] = ctr

tr, q+

tr and {q+

tr} = 22p +

for the truncated operators atr,btr, and ctr. in our case, q+ is quadratic, and so the
tr, qtr} = 0 are true in the p = 0 sector of the
relations {q+
truncated theory. the anticommutator {qtr, qtr}, however, is not equal to 22p tr . so
the diagonalization of {qtr, qtr} will yield a dierent bound-state spectrum than the one
obtained after diagonalizing 22p tr . of course, the two spectra should agree in the limit
t  . at any nite truncation, however, we have the liberty to diagonalize either of
these operators. the choice of {qtr, qtr} species our regularization scheme.

6

choosing to diagonalize the light-cone supercharge qtr has an important advantage:
the spectrum is exactly supersymmetric for any truncation. in contrast, the spectrum of
the hamiltonian p tr becomes supersymmetric only in the innite resolution limit.

let us discuss the discrete symmetries of q. there are three commuting z2 sym-

metries, one of them is the parity in the transverse direction:

p : aij(k, n)  aij(k,n),

bij(k, n)  bij(k,n).

note that p does not commute with q+ or with p:

p q+ = q+p,

p p = pp.

(15)

(16)

the second symmetry is given by a generalization of the tsymmetry dened in [19] (we

will call it s to avoid the confusion with transverse truncation parameter):

s : aij(k, n)  aji(k, n),

bij(k, n)  bji(k,n).

(17)

it commutes with all the noether charges (5)(9). since p and s commute with each

other one needs only one additional symmetry r = p s to close the group.

since q, p and s commute with each other we can diagonalize them simultaneously.
this allows us to diagonalization of the supercharge separately in the sectors with xed

p and s parities and thus will reduce the size of matrices. doing this one nds that the

roles of p and s are dierent. while all the eigenvalues are usually broken into non-

overlapping sodd and seven sectors [18], the p symmetry leads to a double degeneracy

of massive states (in addition to usual bosonfermion degeneracy due to supersymmetry).
to demonstrate this, let us start from the massive bosonic state |m+i:

(cid:16)q(cid:17)2

|m+i = m 2|m+i,

p|m+i = +|m+i.

(18)

if m 6= 0 then the bosonic state q+q|m+i has nonzero norm and it is also an eigenstate
of (q)2 with eigenvalue m 2. this state however has a negative parity:

p q+q|m+i = q+p q|m+i = q+qp|m+i = q+q|m+i.

(19)

thus we found one more nice feature of sdlcq: in addition to preserving supersymmetry

in the truncated theory it also preserves the degeneracy of the spectrum related to parity.

we believe that this degeneracy will be lost in the usual dlcq approximation but

currently have no proof of that.

7

to summarize, we have introduced a truncation procedure that facilitates a numerical

study of the bound state problem, and preserves supersymmetry. the interesting prop-
erty of the light-cone supercharge q (14) is the presence of a gauge coupling constant as
an independent variable, which does not appear in the study of two-dimensional theories.

in the next section, we will study how variations in this coupling aects the bound states

in the theory.

3 numerical results

in order to implement the dlcq formulation of the bound-state problem  which is
tantamount to imposing periodic boundary conditions x = x + 2r [16]  we simply
restrict the light-cone momentum variables ki appearing in the expressions for q+ and

q to the following discretized set of momenta: n 1

denotes the total light-cone momentum of a state, and may be thought of as a xed

k p +, 2

k p +, 3

k p +, . . . ,o. here, p +

constant, since it is easy to form a fock basis that is already diagonal with respect to the
operator p + [15]. the reciprocal of the harmonic resolution k measures the coarseness
of our discretization. the continuum limit is then recovered by taking the limit k  .
physically, 1/k represents the smallest positive unit of longitudinal momentum fraction

allowed for each parton in a fock state.

of course, as soon as we implement the sdlcq procedure, which is specied unam-

biguously by the harmonic resolution k, and cut o transverse momentum modes via
the constraint |ni |  t , the integrals appearing in the denitions for q+ and q are
replaced by nite sums, and so the eigen-equation 2p +p |i = m 2|i is reduced to a
nite matrix diagonalization problem. in this last step we use the fact that p  is pro-
portional to the square of the light-cone supercharge2 q. previously [5] we studied this
theory with k up to 5, but with only one unit of transverse momentum corresponding

to t = 1. in figure 1 we show the spectrum we obtained in that study as a function

of a dimensionless coupling g = gqnl/43. this gure shows several striking features

that we want to analyze in more detail. first, we want to know whether the well dened

strong-coupling spectrum, observed in figure 1, persists at higher values of transverse

resolution t and study its convergence in t . the other striking feature of the k = 5,

t = 1 spectrum is the state that is falling rapidly at large coupling. we will analyze the

compactied theory, corresponding to the sdlcq prescription [7, 14].

note that there are massless states.

behavior of analogous states at dierent values of longitudinal and transverse resolutions
and in particular we will be interested in the fate of the asymptotic (as g  ) massless
state in the continuum limit. in addition to this state there are many states that stay

exactly massless at all values of coupling. as we have shown in [5], the number of such

states does not depend on the value of the transverse resolution. the new numerical data

support this result. the massive state at g = 0 are just the discrete approximation the

a continuum of free particles and is extactly calculable analytically.

our previous sdlcq calculations were done using a code written in mathematica and

performed on a pc. this code has now been rewritten in c++ and some of the present

work was done on supercomputers. we were able to perform numerical diagonalizations

for k = 2 through 7 and for values of t up to t = 9 at k = 4 and t = 1 at k = 7.

3.1 strong coupling: massive spectrum

there are very few theories, other than in 1 + 1 dimensions, where we have good infor-

mation about the strong-coupling spectrum. in 1 + 1 dimensions the concept of strong

coupling has very little meaning since the coupling only comes in as an overall multi-

plicative constant in the hamiltonian. there are a few lattice results but most of what

resolution t for a coupling g = 10 and for longitudinal resolutions k = 4 (a) and k = 5 (b).
boson and fermion masses are identical.

we know comes from theories that have dualities with weakly coupled theories. for the
(2 + 1)-dimensional n = 1 sym theory we are considering, there is no known duality
between strong and weak coupling. using sdlcq, however, we can directly uncover the

behavior of the theory at strong coupling.

in figure 2, we plot the bound state mass squared m 2, in units of 42/l2, as a
function of the transverse resolution t for k = 4 and k = 5 in the strong-coupling

regime. we see that these curves are amazingly at, showing that this theory converges

very rapidly with the transverse cuto. we saw previously in (1 + 1)-dimensional models

[9] that sdlcq converges much faster than dlcq, and this appears to persist for the

transverse momentum in 2 + 1 dimensions. from these gures it appears that we get

sensible results by t = 2 and good results already for t = 3.

given this rapid convergence, a sensible procedure is to remove the transverse cuto

by extrapolating the masses of the low lying bounds states to large transverse resolution

at each value of the longitudinal resolution (thus constructing the sdlcq spectrum

of the complete three dimensional theory) and then extrapolating to large longitudinal

resolution k for each of the states to nd the spectrum as a function of the coupling. for

k = 6 and 7 we simply take the masses at the largest transverse momentum since there

g. we show the plots for k = 4, t = 9 (a) and k = 6, t = 1 (b).

are not enough transverse moment points to make a meaningful extrapolation.

let us look at the bound state mass as a function of the coupling. fig. 3(a) shows an

example of states completely settled down in transverse resolution, namely k = 4, t = 9.

in contrast, fig. 3(b) has only t = 1 at k = 6. notice that nevertheless both plots show

extremely stable states as a function of the coupling g, irrespective of their status of

convergence in t . as we found in our preliminary study [5] of this theory, all the masses

in the strong-coupling region are independent of the coupling. we see that by a coupling
of g = 20 a stable strong-coupling spectrum has appeared. we have looked as high
as couplings of 1000 and we see this same behavior for all longitudinal and transverse

resolutions.

in figure 4 we plot the bound state mass as a function of 1/k . these results are the
rst calculation of the strong-coupling bound states of n = 1 sym in 2+1 dimensions. as
we increase the resolution we are able to see states that have, as their primary component,

more and more partons, and, as we have seen in other supersymmetric theories, many

of these states appear at low energies. this accumulation of high-multiplicity low-mass

states appears to be a unique property of susy theories. in non-susy theories the new

states appear at increasing energies. in the dimensionally reduced version of this theory

we saw that the accumulation point of these low-mass states appeared to be at zero mass

in the transverse resolution t . for k = 6 and 7 we take the values at the highest resolution
t .

[5, 6]. here again we see clear evidence of an accumulation of low mass states, however

we dont have sucient information to say whether an accumulation point exists.

at this point we have not attempted to follow a specic bound state as a function

of k. the appearance of new low mass as we increase k makes this dicult, however

a careful study of the wavefunction should make it possible. also the accuracy of the

extrapolation to innite k would be greatly impoved by addition of one or two additional

transverse resolution at the largest values of k.

3.2 strong coupling: unphysical states

in our preliminary study of this model we found one state that was particularly striking.

it was very heavy at small coupling and approached zero mass at strong coupling, cf. fig-

ure 1. we have now been able to look at this state at higher values of both transverse

and longitudinal resolutions. we now believe that this state is most likely not a physical

m 2 of these states in units of 42/l2 are plotted as a function of g = gn l/43/2 for k = 5

line) and t = 4 (long dashed line).

one.

we are now able to identify two states with irregular coupling dependence which are

shown in figure 5 at various transverse resolution for k = 5. we see that as we increase

the transverse cuto these states move up rapidly in mass, leading us to conclude that
as t  , they decouple. one of these irregular states falls down to m = 0 and then
moves up, while another one has the same type of behavior, but with nite minimal

mass. the fact that the rst state touches zero is of some interest: a similar behavior

was noted in a supersymmetric scalar matrix model in [8] and in that model the authors

conjecture that this behavior might signal the existence of a critical coupling. here the

point where the mass goes to zero would appear to move to innity as we remove the

transverse cuto, and it is not at all clear that those ideas carry over here.

at k = 6 and k = 4 we do not see these states, at least not at the same masses but

at k = 7 we again see such states. we believe that this is strong evidence that these

13

are unphysical states. clearly a real normalizable bound state must be visible at both

even and odd resolutions, which is not the case here. recently we have seen unphysical

massless states of this type in a two dimensional theory with (8, 8) supersymmetry [6].

in that theory we had an independent theoretical evidence for them to be unphysical.

3.3 massless states

in figure 1 we see a number of states that become massless as g  0. we already
explained this property in [5]. namely at zero coupling only the rst term survives in the
supercharge (14) and then all the partons with n = 0 (anti-)commute with q. thus
any state constructed from such partons only becomes massless. the inverse statement
is also true: at g = 0 a massless state cannot contain any parton with n 6= 0. thus the
set of massless states at g = 0 coincides with a hilbert space of the theory dimensionally
reduced to 1 + 1. moreover, the whole infrared spectrum of sym2+1 at small coupling is

governed by the dimensionally reduced theory (see [5] for details).

previously [5, 10] we commented on the existence of exactly massless states and in

[5] on the one-to-one correspondence between them and massless states of the (1 + 1)-

dimensional model. actually this fact provides an easy way to construct massless states

for three-dimensional theories; the matrices to be diagonalized have a size much smaller

than the ones used in the straightforward approach. the counting of massless states in

three dimensions is also reduced to the analogous problem in 1 + 1 dimensions. for nite
nc, even the (1 + 1)-dimensional case is not easily handled [10]; however, for large nc the
multi-trace states decouple, and one needs to count only single-trace massless states. at
resolution k there are 2(k  1) of them. as a numerical check of the correspondence
between massless sectors of (2 + 1) and (1 + 1)-dimensional theories, we can count the

massless states at dierent values of transverse resolution and as anticipated we found

this number to be independent of t . these massless states are bps states in the sense
that they are destroyed by one super-charge, q, and not the other, q+, and the bps
bound, which is zero here, is saturated.

in [5] it appeared that there were additional states that became massless as g  
but now we believe that these states are unphysical. therefore the only massless states at
nonzero coupling are the same 2(k  1) bps states we saw in the dimensionally reduced
model.

4 discussion

in this work, we considered the bound states of three dimensional su(n) n = 1 super-
yang-mills dened on the compactied space-time r  s 1  s 1. in particular, we com-
pactied the light-cone coordinate x on a light-like circle via dlcq, and wrapped the
remaining transverse coordinate x on a spatial circle. we showed explicitly that sdlcq,
employed in recent studies of (1+1)-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, extends
naturally to 2 + 1 dimensions. the supersymmetry becomes n = (1, 1) because we can
always chose p to be zero in a light-cone quantized eld theory, and sdlcq provides
a regularization scheme that preserves this supersymmetry. the supersymmetric theory

considered here is nite and requires no renormalization.

by retaining a nite number of transverse and longitudinal modes, we were able

to solve for bound-state wave functions and masses numerically by diagonalizing the

discretized light-cone supercharge. the theory clearly has a stable spectrum at both

small and large couplings. in figure 2 we see that the theory converges very rapidly in

the transverse resolution. we have seen in reference [10] that sdlcq gives very smooth

behavior in the longitudinal resolution. in figure 5 we see that the states with irregular

coupling dependence move o rapidly to high mass with increasing transverse resolution.

they also do not seem to appear at resolutions 4 and 6. we therefore conclude that they

are not physical states. we see that there are no new massless states at strong coupling,

and the complete massless sector of sym2+1 is determined by the two-dimensional model.
the number of exactly massless states at any coupling is 2(k  1), with no dependence
on the transverse resolution. in addition, some states become massless as g goes to zero,

but their behavior is also described by the theory in 1 + 1 dimensions. consequently, we

conclude that the entire massless spectrum of the (2+1)-dimensional model is determined

by the dimensionally reduced model.

in previous work [5] we saw that the average number of particles in the massless

states increases with g and quickly becomes equal to the maximum number allowed

by the resolution. we also see here that the number of low-mass states increases with

resolution. together this implies that at strong coupling the light states of this theory,

and other susy theories, have a huge number of degrees of freedom. no doubt, it is this

fact that allows for the possibility that these susy theories can contain all of the physics

of dual theories in a dierent number of space-time dimensions. it would be interesting

to relate this observation with the recent claim that strongly coupled super-yang-mills

15

theory corresponds to string theory in an anti-de sitter background [3]. of course, the

techniques we have employed here may be applied to any supersymmetric gauge theory

dened on a suitably compactied space-time. this should facilitate a more general study

of the strongly coupled dynamics of super-yang-mills theories, and in particular, allow

us to scrutinize the string-like properties of yang-mills theories.

we have neglected the zero modes totally in this calculation. it remains an important

problem to include these modes. we already know a great deal about zero modes [20]

which are, after all, really only a few extra quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. it

has recently been conjectured by witten [22] that including these zero modes leads to

spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in this theory.

let us briey comment on the l dependence of the spectrum. for large l the appro-

priate dimensionless l independent mass scale is;

m 2
g4n 2 

m 2l2/42

(g)4

at large g the spectrum is constant in terms of m 2l2/42, therefore in terms of this
dimensionless mass scale the entire spectrum would go to zero as g  . a possible
interpretation of this result is that in the continuum limit this theory approaches a

conformal eld theory. there are however very massive states in our spectrum, that we

did not study, that could remain massive in the contimuum limit.

the code that we are currently using is a newly written c++ version of the mathemat-

ica code that we used in much of our earlier work. our large runs for matrix generation

are currently performed at the ohio supercomputer center. matrix diagonalization is

done using standard lapack routines [21] on supercomputers at the ohio supercomputer

center and the minnesota supercomputing institute. this is our rst project with this

new conguration, and we are currently working on several analytical and numerical im-

provements that we expect will allow us to increase by several factors of 10 the size of

the problems we will be able to address in the future. among these are n = 4 sym in

3 + 1 and n = 1 sym in 2 + 1 with a chern-simons term [22].
