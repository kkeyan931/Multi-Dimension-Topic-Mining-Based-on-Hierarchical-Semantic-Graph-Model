i. introduction

ultrarelativistic heavy-ion-collision experiments at the bnl relativistic heavy ion col-

lider (rhic) and at the cern large hadron collider (lhc) will soon start in anticipa-

tion of producing quark-gluon plasma (qgp). conrmation of the qgp formation is done

through analyzing rates of various reactions taking place in a qgp. so far, the reaction-

rate formula is derived for reactions taking place in the system in thermal and chemical

equilibrium [14]. the actual qgp is, however, not in equilibrium but is an expanding

nonequilibrium system.

in this paper, as a generalization of [14], we present a rst-principles derivation of the

reaction-probability formula for reactions occurring in a nonequilibrium system. we nd

that the formula involves no nite-volume corrections. we also nd from the procedure of

derivation that dierent contributions to the reaction-probability formula have clear physical

interpretation, which is summarized as out-of-equilibrium cutting rules.

in sec. ii, we derive from rst principles the formula for the transition probability of a

generic reaction taking place in a nonequilibrium system. in sec. iii, specializing to quasi-

uniform systems near equilibrium or nonequilibrium quasistationary systems,1 we further

deduce the formula, nding that the formula is written in terms of the closed-time-path for-

malism of real-time thermal eld theory [5]. in sec. iv, we present a calculational procedure

of a generic reaction-probability formula obtained in sec. iii.

ii. nonequilibrium reaction-probability formula

a. preliminaries

the formalism presented in this paper can be applied to a broad class of theories including

qcd (cf. the end of sec. iii), but, for simplicity of presentation, we take a system of self-

1framework for dealing with such systems is comprehensively discussed in [5].

interacting, neutral scalars s with mass m and 4 interaction. the system is inside

a cube with volume v = l3. employing the periodic boundary conditions, we label the

single-particle basis by its momentum pk = 2k/l, kj = 0,1,2,   , (j = 1, 2, 3).

physically interesting reactions are of the following generic type,

{a} + nonequilibrium system  {b} + anything .

(2.1)

here {a} and {b} designate group of particles, which are dierent from . examples are
highly virtual particles, heavy particles, and particles interacting weakly with s. gener-

alization to more general process, where among {a} and/or {b} are s, is straightforward
(cf., [4]). for deniteness, let us assume that {a} consists of l s and {b} consists of l
s. here  is a heavy neutral scalar of mass m, so that  is absent in the system. for
simplicity of presentation, we assume a - coupling to be of the form gn/n! (n  2).

the transition or reaction probability p of the process (2.1) is written as

p = n /d ,
n  x{k} x{nk} x{mk} x{n

k}h{a};{mk}| s |{n

k};{b}i

h{b};{n

k}| s |{nk};{a}ih{nk}| |{mk}i s ,

d  x{k} x{nk} x{mk} x{n

k}h{mk}| s |{n

k}i

h{n

k}| s |{nk}ih{nk}| |{mk}i s .

(2.2a)

(2.2b)

(2.2c)

here s is the symmetry factor [6],  is the density matrix, and h{b};{n
a s-matrix element of the vacuum-theory process,

k}| s |{nk};{a}i is

{a} + {nk}  {b} + {n

k} ,

where {nk} denotes the group of s, which consists of the number nk of k ( in a mode k ).
in eqs. (2.2), p{k} denotes summation over momentum/momenta of /s in the nal state
|{n
k};{b}i, and of /s in the two initial states |{mk};{a}}i and |{nk};{a}i. (among

3

the nal states |{n
that the perturbation series for d starts from 1,

k};{b}i, is |0;{b}i. this is also the case for two initial states.) note

d = 1 +    .

it is to be noted that {a} and {b} in hsi, which we write {a, b}s, are not necessarily
involved in one connected part of hsi. this is also the case for {a, b}s. we assume that,
in w  hsihsi, {a, b}s and {a, b}s are involved in one connected part wc ( w ).
then, w consists, in general, of wc and other parts which are disconnected with wc and

include only s. generalization to other cases is straightforward [4]. it should be remarked

on the form of  in eqs. (2.2). let us recall the following two facts. on the one hand, the

statistical ensemble is dened by the density matrix at the very initial time ti ( ). on
the other hand, in constructing perturbative framework, an adiabatic switching o of the

interaction is required [7,3]. then,  in eqs. (2.2) is a functional of the in-eld in(ti, x)

that constitutes the basis of perturbation theory.

as will be seen below, diagrammatic analysis shows that n , eq. (2.2b), takes the form,

n = ncon d ,

(2.3)

where ncon corresponds to a connected diagram and d is as in eq. (2.2c). then, we have

p = ncon .

the s-matrix element in vacuum theory is obtained through an application of the re-

duction formula [2,4]:

zs in eq. (2.6) are the wave-function renormalization constants. it is to be noted that, in

eq. (2.4), among nk (n

(emitted from) the ik (i

hsi in d in eq. (2.2c) is given by a similar expression to eq. (2.4), where factors related

to the  elds are deleted.

from the form for hsi, eq. (2.4), we see that the permutation of n (n = 1,   , ik) and
k) give the same feynman diagram (in vacuum theory),

the permutation of n (n = 1,   , i
and then ik!i

k! same diagrams emerge. taking this fact into account, we may write (2.4) in

the form,

k  nk + ik and a is the truncated green function in conguration space (in

vacuum theory), and, e.g., {y} collectively denotes y1, y2,   , yl.

among the feynman diagrams for a, are some diagrams, in which some s ( {}) [s
( {})] coincide with xs ( {x}) and/or ys ( {y}) and/or s ( {}) [s ( {})]. in
such cases, a is understood to include corresponding -functions, e.g.,  4(k j  xi).

the expression for hsi, the complex conjugate of hsi, is obtained by taking the complex
conjugate of eq. (2.4) or eq. (2.7), where we make the substitution (cf. eqs. (2.2b) and

(npk = 0, 1, 2,  ), we use the same notation as in eq. (2.9), |{nk}i, since no confusion

(2.12)

where 1 < il1+1 < il1+l2+1 <    < in lm+1  n. in eq. (2.12), let bl and bl are in between
one set of curly brackets. then, if l < l, bl is located at the left of bl and vice versa. we

are now in a position to write

here, the second summationpls runs over all solutions in integers of eq. (2.11) and the third
summation pgr runs over all ways of making m groups as in eq. (2.12). from eq. (2.13),
sc is determined iteratively. for example,

sc(b1b2) = s(b1b2)  s(b1)s(b2)
sc(b1b2b3) = s(b1b2b3)  sc(b1b2)s(b3)  sc(b1b3)s(b2)

s(b1)sc(b2b3)  s(b1)s(b2)s(b3) .

note that, when hsi ( w ) or hsi consists of several disconnected parts, corresponding
(momentum-conservation) -function above becomes product of several -functions.

the form for d, eq. (2.2c), is given by eq. (2.16) or eq. (2.19), in which factors related

to the  elds are deleted.

in general, n consists of several graphically disconnected parts. as assumed in sec. iia,
all s are included in one connected parts ncon. other parts, which we write d, include

9

only the constituent particles  of the system. then, it is obvious that n takes the form
n = ncond (cf. eq. (2.3)). it is also obvious that d is a contribution to d in eqs. (2.2).
then, such contribution does contribute to the reaction-probability p, eq. (2.2a), as ncon,
which has already been dealt with in a lower-order level. thus, computation of n s, which
consist of one connected part, is sucient.

iii. out-of-equilibrium reaction-probability formula

a. preliminaries

in this section, we restrict our concern to quasiuniform systems near equilibrium and

nonequilibrium quasistationary systems, which we simply refer to as out-of-equilibrium sys-

tems. such systems are characterized [5] by weak dependence of the reaction probabilities

on xc (cf. above after eq. (2.18)). more precisely, there exists a spacetime scale l, such

c  x 

c0| (= |x 

that the reaction probabilities do not appreciably depend on xc, when xc is in the space-
time region |x 
c0 an arbitrary spacetime point. for such
c0| < l. going
systems, the reactions are regarded as taking place in the region |x 
to the momentum space, this means that the contribution (to the reaction probability n )
from the state that includes very soft momentum |p | < 1/l should be small. more

c |) < l with x 

c  x 

precisely, the contribution from the summation-region in eq. (2.16), in which at least one
momentum (out of {pj, qj, p

j}) is very soft is negligibly small.2

j, q

2this is the case for most practical cases, which can be seen as follows. let t be a typical
scale(s) of the system under consideration. in the case of thermal-equilibrium system, t is the
temperature of the system. due to interactions, an eective mass is induced and the vacuum-theory

mass m turns out to the eective mass mef f (xc). in the case of m >> t , mef f (xc) is not
t , a tadpole diagram induces mass of o(t ), so that
[t (or even t ) is the scale that characterizes reactions. we assume

much dierent from m and, for m <

the contribution to n that include hai can be ignored. same reasoning shows that the
contribution including hai and/or sc(aa    a) and/or sc(aa    a) may also be ignored.

most amplitudes, when computed in perturbation theory (to be deduced below), are insensitive to

the region |p |  o(t ). then, the contribution from the region |p | <

 1/l is small, since

the phase-space volume is small. incidentally, in the case of equilibrium thermal qed or qcd

(m = 0), there are some quantities that diverge at infrared limits to leading order in hard-thermal-

loop resummation scheme [8,9]. for such cases, more elaborate analysis is required.

at the beginning of this subsection, for the system under consideration, the function (3.2)

in case of the system in which translation invariance holds, ha

us that n(p0, p) = n (p0, p) is the number density of a particle with momentum p. this

allows us to interpret n(x; p0, p) as the bare number density of a quasiparticle with p at

the spacetime point x . (for more details, see [10].)

c. construction of out-of-equilibrium propagators

so far, for simplicity of presentation, we have dealt with real-scalar-eld systems. phys-

ical meaning of the propagators to be deduced below can be determined more transparent

manner by employing a complex-scalar-eld systems, which we deal with in the sequel of

this section. let ap (a

p) be an annihilation [a creation] operator for a particle of momen-

tum p. the antiparticle counterpart of ap (a

p) is bp (b

p). for simplicity, we assume that

qi, hapbqi vanish. same reasoning as at the beginning of this section
paqis and

the density-matrix operator  commutes with charge operator q, [, q] = 0. then, all but
ha

a) let us take a feynman diagram f for n (cf. eq. (2.16)), and pick out from f
a vacuum-theory propagator i(0)(z1  z2) = h0| t (z1)(z2)|0i  hsi( n ). then, we
pick up the following two diagrams for n . the rst one is the same as f , except that

with p  (ep,p), etc. adding the above two contributions to the original contribution,
and fourier transforming on z1  z2, we obtain for the relevant part,

i11(cid:18)z1 + z2

(3.11)

here, n with p0 > 0 is as in eq. (3.10) with (3.7), while, for p0 < 0, n takes the same form

(3.10) where n is dened, with obvious notation, as

as discussed at the end of the last subsection, n(x; p0, p) with p0 > 0 is the bare

number density of a quasiparticle with momentum p at the point x . similarly, n(x; p0, p)

with p0 < 0 is the bare number density of an anti-quasiparticle with momentum p at
x .

b) starting from hsi ( n ) that includes a vacuum-theory propagator [i(0)(z1  z2)]

and proceeding as above a), we obtain

(3.16)

above derivation of iij (i, j = 1, 2) is self explanatory for their physical meaning or

interpretation. the physical interpretation is summarized as generalized cutting rules, which

is a generalization of cutkoskys cutting rules in vacuum theory. (for more details, see [4].)

16

d. closed-time-path formalism

iij (i, j = 1, 2) obtained above are nothing but the propagators in the closed-time-

path (ctp) formalism of out-of-equilibrium quantum eld theory [5]. the ctp formalism

is constructed on the directed time-path c = c1  c2 in a complex-time plane, where
c1 = (  +) and c2 = (+  ). a eld (x0, x) with x0  c1 [x0  c2]
is denoted by 1(x0, x) [2(x0, x)] and is called a type-1 [type-2] eld. the interaction

lagrangian density is of the form,

lint = l(1)
int  l(2)
int ,

l(i)
(
i i)2 
int = 
4

g
(n!)2 i(

i i)n ,

(i = 1, 2) .

then, the vertex factor for the type-1 vertex that comes from l(1)
vacuum theory, while the vertex factor for the type-2 vertex is minus the corresponding

int is the same as in

type-1 vertex factor. the ctp propagators are dened by the statistical average of the

time-path-ordered product of elds, which are written as

1(y)ic ,
2(y)ic = [i11(y, x)] ,

i11(x, y) = ht1(x)
i22(x, y) = ht2(x)
i12(x, y) = h
i21(x, y) = h2(x)

2(y)1(x)ic ,
1(y)ic ,

(3.17)

where t (t) is the time-ordering (anti-time-ordering) symbol.

in computing (3.17), one

identies 2 with 1. comparing eq. (3.17) with the above deduction of ij (i, j = 1, 2),

eqs. (3.11), (3.12), (3.14), and (3.16), we see that x of 1(x) in eq. (3.17) corresponds
to a vertex-point in hsi ( w) and x of 2(x) corresponds to a vertex-point in hsi. the
vertex factors in hsi ( w) are i for ()2/4 interaction and ig for g()n/(n!)2
interaction. then, the vertex factors in hsi ( w) are, in corresponding order to the above,
i and ig. this is in accord with the above-mentioned vertex factors in the ctp formalism.

17

e. reaction-probability formula

observation made so far shows that n in eq. (2.16) with eq. (3.5) corresponds to an

amplitude in the ctp formalism of the process,

(3.18)

as mentioned at the end of sec. ii, only connected n s contribute to the reaction-probability
p. thus, we nally obtain
p = 
yj=1z d 4xj d 4x


yj=1z d 4yj d 4y

 xdiagramsz d 41    nd fi(x;{(k  k)}) ,

j)


jfj(xj)f (x

j (yj)gj(y

jg

l

l

(3.19)

where fi is a connected amplitude in the ctp formalism which includes all s. in eq. (3.19),
we have used {} for collectively denoting all the (external and internal) vertex-points and
the summation runs over diagrams. a pair of s, k and k, in a pair of brackets (   ) in
fi denotes the vertex-points that are connected by ikl(k(k), k(k)).

here some remarks are in order.

1) as mentioned at the beginning of section, inclusion of the initial correlations (3.2) or

(3.3) is straightforward.

2) taking the innite-volume limit v   goes as follows:

v

(2)3 z d 3p ,

xp 
ap  s (2)3

v

a(p) ,

etc.

above deduction shows that there is no nite-volume correction, in the sense that

there do not exist extra contributions to n , which disappear in the limit v  . it
should be stressed that this statement holds for periodic boundary conditions.

18

3) it is clear from the above deduction (cf. subsecs. b and c) that the ctp formalism

here is formulated in terms of the bare number density of quasiparticles. a canonical

ctp formalism is formulated in terms of the physical or observed number density of

quasiparticles. how to translate the former into the latter is discussed in [10].

finally, we make a comment on gauge theories. if we choose a physical gauge like the

coulomb gauge or the landsho-rebhan variant [11] of a covariant gauge, the gauge boson

may be dealt with in a similar manner to the above scalar-eld case. if we adopt a traditional

covariant gauge, a straightforward modication is necessary.

iv. computational procedure

in this section, we present a concrete procedure of computing the reaction probability p

up to nth-order terms with respect to the x derivatives.

1) from fi in eq. (3.19), we pick out iij(, ),

ij(, ) =xz d 4p eip ()ij(cid:18) + 

2

; p(cid:19) .

(4.1)

since fi includes s, the vertex-point  [] is connected3 with a vertex-point v [v]  v
(cf. fig. 1):

1

 + 

2

(j+1  j)

k+1 = v, with v, v  v. in eq. (4.2), each pair of
j+1], is connected by one or

j+1) + v + v
 ,

j and 

(4.2)

where 0 = , 

0 = , k+1 = v, 

spacetime points in a pair of brackets, j+1 and j [

3note that, in general, the vertex-points v and v are not uniquely singled out. (v can coincides

with v.) however, dierent choices of v and v leads to the same reaction probability p within the
accuracy under consideration.

19

several ikl(j+1, j) [ikl(

j, 

j+1)] in fi (cf. fig. 1). here, we note that v and v may

be written as

v = x + v ,

v = x + v ,

(4.3)

where x is the mid-point of the external-vertex points, around which the reaction is taking

place:

x =

1

2(l + l)


(xj + x

j) +

l

xj=1

l

xj=1

(yj + y

j)
 .

2) using eqs. (4.2) and (4.3), we expand ij(( + )/2; p ) in eq. (4.1) as

ij(cid:18) + 

2

; p(cid:19)

= ij(x; p ) +

k

1

xj=0
(j+1  j)

2h 
j+1) + v + vi  xij(x; p ) +    ,

+

k

xj=0

(

j  

(4.4)

where     stands for terms with higher-order derivative with respect to x. the series (4.4)
is truncated at the nth-order terms with respect to the x derivatives. the approximation

in which    is ignored is called the gradient approximation.

3) let us deal with the term with (j+1  j) in eq. (4.4). it can easily be shown that

(j+1  j) ikl(j+1, j) becomes4

(j+1  j)xz d 4p  ei(p +p )(j+1j)ikl(cid:18)j+1 + j
ikl(cid:18)j + j+1

= xz d 4p  ei(p +p )(j+1j ) 

ip 


2

2

; p + p (cid:19)
; p + p (cid:19) .

other terms and higher x -derivative terms     in eq. (4.4) may be dealt with similarly.
all other parts of fi, eq. (3.19), than the one (4.1) may be dealt with similarly.

4as in the case of some self-energy-type subdiagram,

there are several

ikl(j+1, j)s

[ikl(

j, 

j+1)s] (cf. fig. 1). in such a case, one chooses any one of them.

20

4) carrying out the integrations over all vertex-points except those in v, we have

momentum-conservation -functions at each internal vertex point.

as discussed at the beginning of sec. iii, the wave functions of s should be localized

within the space region < li (i = 1, 2, 3). however, for simplicity, we assume in the sequel

that the wave functions of s are of plane-wave form,5

fj(x) = eirjx/(cid:16)2vqr2
jy/(cid:18)2vqr 2

gj(y) = eir

,

j + m 2(cid:17)1/2
j + m 2(cid:19)1/2

.

(4.5)

5) we carry out the integrations over all vertex-points in v to yield momentum-
conservation -functions at those vertex points and we are left with integrations over the

independent or loop momenta. keeping the terms up to the nth-order terms with respect

to the x derivatives, we obtain the nal formula, which may be written in the form,

p = z d 4x a(x; r

1,    , r

l; r1,   , rl) .

(4.6)

note that a depends weakly on x through n(x; qk)s. from eq. (4.6), we see that a is the

reaction rate per unit volume. incidentally, were it not for this x-dependence, integration

over x in eq. (4.6) would yield v t , where v is the volume of the system and t = tf  ti
is the time interval during which the reaction takes place. in the limit v, t  , the v t
becomes

lim

v, t

here, for the purpose of illustration, we deal with the heavy- production process,

5it is to be noted that, if we use the the plane-wave form (4.5) in eq. (2.19), x-dependence

disappears. in the procedure presented here, x-dependence of n is already (partially) taken into
account before arriving at 4).

the system is composed of real scalar  with lint = 3/3!, and  interacts with 
through l = g2/2. we analyze the contribution from fig. 2 for p in eqs. (2.2).
using eq. (2.16), we have

we compute the contributions that include only two-point functions. if necessary, the con-

keeping the terms that do not vanish kinematically, we have

where x = (x + y)/2 and p  = q = p1  r and q = p2 + p1  r.

eq. (4.8) corresponds to a contribution to the amplitude in the ctp formalism of the

process (cf. eq. (3.18)), 2(r)  1(r), and constitutes a part of the diagram as depicted
in fig. 3 in the ctp formalism. as a matter of fact, eq. (4.8) represents fig. 3 with

(p10 > 0, p20 > 0, q0 > 0) plus fig. 3 with (p10 > 0, p20 < 0, q0 < 0).
