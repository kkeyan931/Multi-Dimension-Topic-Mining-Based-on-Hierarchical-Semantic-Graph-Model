we construct solutions of type iib supergravity dual to n = 2 super yang-mills theories.
by considering a probe moving in a background with constant coupling and an ads5
component in its geometry, we are able to reproduce the exact low energy eective action
for the theory with gauge group su (2) and nf = 4 massless avors. after turning on a
mass for the avors we nd corrections to the ads5 geometry. in addition, the coupling
shows a power law dependence on the energy scale of the theory. the origin of the power
law behaviour of the coupling is traced back to instanton corrections. instanton corrections

to the four derivative terms in the low energy eective action are correctly obtained from a

probe analysis. by considering a wilson loop in this geometry we are also able to compute
the instanton eects on the quark-antiquark potential. finally we consider a solution

corresponding to an asymptotically free eld theory. again, the leading form of the four

derivative terms in the low energy eective action are in complete agreement with eld
theory expectations.

1. introduction

recent progress in string theory has lead to a deep and powerful connection between

yang-mills theory and string theory, something which was expected more than twenty

years ago[1].

in particular, according to maldacena[2] the large n and large t hooft

coupling dynamics of yang-mills theory is captured by supergravity. this relationship can

be motivated by studying a brane in full string theory. one then considers a low energy

limit which decouples the eld theory from gravity, and at the same time one considers

the near horizon limit of the corresponding supergravity solution.

in this paper, we study the low energy limits of n = 2 super yang-mills theory, re-
alized as the world volume theory on a dirichlet three brane moving near seven branes,

that is, threebranes in f theory. we begin by identifying the exact eective complex cou-

pling[3] of the low energy eld theory with the complex coupling of type iib supergravity.

the remaining supergravity equations then determine a unique metric. this supergravity

solution corresponds to a sevenbrane background. we then consider introducing a large

number n of coincident threebranes into the problem. the solution for the threebranes

plus sevenbranes has the same complex coupling as the pure sevenbrane background[4].

the presence of the threebranes does however deform the geometry and switch on a ux

for the self-dual ve form. the ux and deformed metric are determined by solving the

laplace equation on the background generated by the sevenbranes[4]. the eld theory of

interest is then realized on the worldvolume of a threebrane probe moving in this geometry.

on the supergravity side, we are studying the two-body interaction between the source

and probe threebranes. we will thus compare the worldvolume theory of the probe to the

low energy eective action for the eld theory with gauge group su (2).

the rst example we consider is the theory with nf = 4 massless avors. this theory
is a nite conformal eld theory and as expected the geometry contains an ads5 factor.
by requiring that the eective action in eld theory has an exact sl(2, z) symmetry, we

are able to x the form of the six derivative terms[5]. after performing a eld redenition

on the eld theory side [5],[6],[7], the form of the eld theory eective action and probe

action agree up to and including six derivative contributions. this computation is a simple
extension of the result reported in [5] for the n = 4 case. the new feature is the identi-
cation of the correct brane coordinates which lead to the expected overall n dependence

of the probe action.

the next example we study is the theory with nf = 4 massive avors. the presence
of the avor masses explicitly breaks the conformal invariance. indeed, the coupling of

1

this theory picks up a dependence on the energy scale of the theory due to instanton

corrections. solutions of this type are particularly interesting from the point of view of

the gravity/eld theory connection. the radial direction of the ads5 space plays the role

of an energy scale in the conformal eld theory case[8]. however, all beta functions in

the conformal eld theory vanish and the evolution under the renormalization group is

trivial. examples of quantum eld theories that are not conformal have a much richer

renormalization group evolution and may provide valuable insights into the role of the

fth dimension[9].

in this case, we are able to determine the rst corrections to the

ads5 geometry. this approximate background leads to corrections to the four derivative

terms in the probe action that are consistent with the form of instanton corrections to the

four derivative terms in the eld theory. we also compute the quark-antiquark potential

in this geometry.

our third and nal example considers the pure gauge theory. we are able to nd an

approximate solution, valid when the separation between the probe and source is large.

this geometry reproduces the correct semiclassical structure of the four derivative terms. it

would thus seem that the background we have found is capable of describing perturbative

eld theory on the probe world volume. by explicitly computing the magnitude of the

square of the ricci tensor, we are able to explain why this is indeed the case.

when this work was near completion we received [10]. in these papers solutions of

iib supergravity corresponding to non-conformal eld theories were constructed. these
solutions preserve the so(6) invariance of the ads5s5 solution, and thus are similar but
not identical to the solution we obtain in the nf = 4 massive avors case.

2. n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su (2) and nf = 4 massless
multiplets

in this section we begin by collecting the known eld theory results on the low energy
eective action of n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su (2) and nf = 4
massless matter multiplets. these are then compared to the result obtained from studying

a probe threebrane in supergravity.

2

2.1. field theory results

the perturbative beta function for n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group
su (nc) and nf avor hypermultiplets is proportional to (2nc  nf ). thus, for nc = 2
and nf = 4, the perturbative beta function vanishes. if in addition all of the avors of
matter are massless, we obtain a nite conformally invariant theory[11]. the exact eective

coupling of the theory has the form

 = 1 + i2 = cl +

i

 xn=0,2,4,...

cneincl = cl +

i

 xn=0,2,4,...

cnqn,

where cl is the classical coupling of the theory. the coecient c0 is a one loop pertur-
bative correction, which in the pauli-villars scheme, has the value c0 = 4 log(2)[12]. the
coecients cn with n > 0 and even come from nonperturbative (instanton) eects. the
two instanton coecient has been computed and has the value c2 = 7/(2635). the lead-
ing contribution to the low energy eective action comprises all terms with the equivalent

of two derivatives or four fermions[13] and is determined in terms of the eective coupling.

the next-to-leading contribution to the low energy eective action contains all terms with

the equivalent of four derivatives or eight fermions[13]. using the scale invariance and
u (1)r symmetry of the model, dine and seiberg argued that the four derivative term is
one loop exact[14]. in [15] the vanishing of instanton corrections to the four derivative

terms was explicitly veried and a rigorous proof of this non-renormalization theorem has

recently been given in [16]. the one loop contribution to the four derivative terms has

been considered in [17]. the result for the low energy eective action, up to and including
four derivative terms, in n = 2 superspace, is given by

(2.1)

where a is an n = 2 abelian chiral supereld. the number of terms that contribute to
the low energy eective action at each order, for six derivative terms or higher, increases

rapidly and a direct approach to these terms is not feasible. an elegant approach to study
these terms has been developed in [5]for n = 4 super yang-mills, based on the conjectured
sl(2, z) duality of the theory. this duality was used to x the form of the eective action

up to six derivatives. the theory that we are studying is also believed to have an exact

sl(2, z) duality[11], and under this assumption the analysis of [5]applies.

under duality, the second term above mixes with the two and four derivative terms and
consequently its coecient is xed. the requirement of self duality does not x (6), since
duality maps this term into itself at lowest order. these are the eld theory results that

we wish to compare to gravity.

on the gravity side, we will consider a probe moving in a background to be specied

below. the probe worldvolume dynamics is captured by a born-infeld action. the born-

infeld action itself is self-dual, but the duality does not act on the separation of the branes.

this separation is parametrized by the higgs elds which belong to the same supermultiplet

as the gauge elds. this implies, as pointed out in [5], that the higgs elds that realize
n = 2 supersymmetry linearly must be related by a nonlinear gauge eld dependent
redenition to the separation. it is interesting to note that a similar eld redenition is

needed to map the linear realization of conformal symmetry in super yang-mills theory

into the isometry of the anti de-sitter spacetime of the supergravity description[6]. we

refer the reader to [5] for the detailed form of the eld redenitions. the result after

performing the eld redenitions, in terms of component elds, reads

where we have set  = i 4

they depend on the arbitrary constant (6). the value of (6) as well as the structure of the
eective action given above can be checked by explicitly computing instanton corrections

to the six derivative terms. we hope to return to this in the near future[18]. notice that

all acceleration terms were eliminated by the eld redenition, something rst noted in[7].

2.2. supergravity results

the supergravity background relevant for the study of n = 2 supersymmetric eld
theory is generated by sevenbranes and a large number of threebranes[4], i.e. threebranes

in f theory. to construct this background it is convenient to start with a solution for the

sevenbranes by themselves[4]. the sevenbrane solution is described in terms of non-zero

metric, dilaton and axion elds. as usual, the metric and axion are combined into a single
complex coupling  =  + ie = 1 + i2. the coupling  is identied with the modular
parameter of the elliptic ber of the f theory compactication. the (8, 9) plane is taken
to be orthogonal to the sevenbranes. in terms of the complex coordinate z = x8 + ix9 we

make the following ansatz for the metric

ds2 = e(z,z)dzdz + (dx7)2 + ... + (dx1)2  (dx0)2.

(2.4)

the parameter z is to be identied with the higgs eld appearing in the low energy eective
action of the n = 2 eld theory. with this ansatz, the type iib supergravity equations of
motion reduce to[19]

  =

  =

2  
  
  
(   )2 .

(2.5)

the complex coupling  is identied with the low energy eective coupling of the n = 2
eld theory. supersymmetry constrains the eective coupling of the eld theory to be a

function of z, so that the rst equation in (2.5) is automatically satised. the general

solution to the second equation in (2.5) is

(z, z) = log(2) + f (z) + f (z).

(2.6)

the functions f (z) and f (z) should be chosen in order that (2.4) yields a sensible metric.
for the case that we are considering, the explicit form for the metric transverse to the

sevenbranes is

ds2 = e(z,z)dzdz = 2|da|2,

(2.7)

where a is the quantity that appears in the seiberg-witten solution[4]. this species the

solution for the sevenbranes by themselves.

5

next following [4], we introduce threebranes into the problem1. the presence of the

threebranes modies the metric and switches on a non-zero ux for the self dual rr ve-
form eld strength. the world volume coordinates of the threebranes are x0, x1, x2, x3.

one obtains a valid solution[4] by making the following ansatz for the metric

k + f 1/2gijdxidxj
and the following ansatz for the self-dual 5-form eld strength

ds2 = f1/2dx2

f0123i = 

1
4

if1 .

(2.8)

(2.9)

the complex eld  is unchanged by the introduction of the threebranes. inserting the

above ansatz into the iib supergravity equations of motion, one nds that f satises the

following equation of motion

1
g

i(ggijjf ) = (2)4n

6(x  x0)

 g.

(2.10)

this last equation corresponds to the case in which all of the three branes are located at
the same point. in the limit that n   the curvature becomes small almost everywhere
and the supergravity solution can be used to reliably compute quantities in the eld theory

limit as explained in[4].

in the case of nf = 4 massless hypermultiplets, (2.10) is explicitly given by

the solution is given by

y + 4aa(cid:3)f = (2)4n (4)(y)(2)(a).

(2.11)

f =

(cid:2)y2 + 2|a|2(cid:3)2 .

to reproduce the low energy eective action of the eld theory, we now consider the

dynamics of a threebrane probe moving in this geometry. it is well known that the probe

has a low energy eective action which matches that of the corresponding low energy eld

theories[21]. here we are interested in checking the form predicted by the probe for the

higher order corrections. the leading low energy eective action plus corrections for the

bosons in the background described above, is obtained by expanding the action

(2.13)

notice that each term in this action comes multiplied by a dierent power of n . as things
stand, the 2n derivative term will come with a coecient of  n
2 f n1  n n1. the full
eective action for the probe interacting with n coincident source threebranes, should

come with a overall factor of n [22]. this is achieved by rescaling the d3 coordinates by
n . these are the coordinates of [4]for which the metric (2.7) acquires an explicit overall
n dependence.
it follows that the probe worldvolume coupling is then also the large
n eld theory gauge coupling which is associated with the dilaton of the supergravity

solution. unless specied, we will always assume in the following that this rescaling has

been performed. dening

where fs, is the eld strength appearing on the probe worldvolume and ff, is the eld

strength of the eld theory. note that 2 appearing in (2.12) is the classical coupling plus

all instanton corrections. the fact that the four derivative terms are independent of 2

shows that the supergravity result explicitly reproduces the nonrenormalization theorem

for these terms[23].

7

3. n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su (2) and nf = 4 massive
multiplets

in this section we consider the supergravity solution corresponding to the case where

all avor multiplets have a mass. in this case, both the eective coupling and the four

derivative terms get contributions from instantons. we are able to show that the super-

gravity solution is capable of producing what is expected for the one instanton correction.

we are not however able to x the coecient of this correction. the dilaton of the super-

gravity solution is no longer a constant and there are corrections to the ads5 geometry
reecting the fact that the eld theory is no longer conformally invariant. we compute

the quark-antiquark potential and show that its form is remarkably similar to that for a
quark-antiquark pair in the n = 4 theory at nite temperature.

3.1. field theory results

the masses of the quark avors breaks the conformal invariance that is present in

massless theory.

in this case, the eective coupling does pick up a dependence on the

energy scale as a result of instanton corrections. at high enough energies we expect

these corrections can be neglected and the theory ows to the conformal eld theory

corresponding to the case of massless avors. indeed, the perturbative beta function still

vanishes and the coupling goes to a constant at high energies. we will focus attention

on the two and four derivative terms appearing in the low energy eective action. these
terms are completely specied by a holomorphic prepotential f and a real function h

sef f =

1

2i z d4x(cid:16)z d4f (a) z d4  f ( a)(cid:17) +z d4xz d4d4 h(a, a).

in what follows, we will only account for the one instanton corrections to both the prepoten-

tial and the four derivative terms. the prepotential does not receive any loop corrections

for nf = 4. the one instanton correction to the prepotential was computed in [24]. the
one instanton corrected prepotential is

and the one instanton correction is given by

the one anti-instanton contribution is given by the complex conjugate of the one instanton

correction. the pure scalar two and four derivative terms appearing in the low energy

eective action, after performing the eld redenition needed to compare to the brane

result, are easily obtained by using the formulas quoted in [7],[23]. the results are

notice that for large  the fall o of the four derivative terms is like ||4. this has an

3.2. supergravity results

the rst step in the supergravity analysis entails solving (2.10) for the background

geometry, with the complex coupling  given in (3.1). the coupling  is only valid for
large ||. for small || higher instanton corrections can not be neglected. for this reason,
we will construct a solution to (2.10) which is valid for large ||. towards this end, split

this equation admits a power series solution. to set up the solution, notice that both r

and  have the dimensions of length (l). it is not dicult to see that g has dimension

g = xm

(3.6)

for consisteny, we require that g  0 at least as r4 as r  . if this is not the case,
f1 is not a small correction to f0. thus, we restrict m  4 in (3.6). with this restriction,
after inserting (3.6) into (3.5), one nds for the rst few cm:

are no longer dealing with a conformal eld theory. notice that the ads5 geometry is

notice that the correction to the four derivative terms has the structure of the one instanton

corrections computed using eld theory. we have not been able to x  with our asymptotic

analysis, so that the coecient of this correction could not be checked. as reviewed above,

instanton eects explicitly break the conformal symmetry of the eld theory. the breaking

of the so(2, 4) conformal symmetry in the eld theory is reected in the corrections to

the ads5 geometry, which break the so(2, 4) isometry of the ads5 space. note that the

coupling runs with a power law. solutions of type-0 string theories with a power law

running for the coupling have been studied in [25]. power law running of the coupling has

also played a prominent role in gauge-coupling unication in theories with large internal

dimensions[26]. the presence of the large internal dimensions is reected in the fact that

massive kaluza-klein modes run in loops of the four dimensional theory. this gives rise

to a power law running of the couplings.

in [10] it was suggested that this eect may

be responsible for the power law running of couplings in the iib background discussed in

that study. in our case, there is no need for eects due to large internal dimensions and

the power law running of the coupling is simply explained by instanton eects in the four

dimensional eld theory.

before leaving this section we would like to make some comments on the supergravity
interpretation of the leading |a|4 behaviour of the four derivative terms. the operator on
the worldvolume which couples to the dilaton is given by[27]

by expanding the born-infeld action one nds a four derivative term in the eective po-

the leading term of |a|4 comes from the static massless propagator in the six dimensional
transverse space. this term is due to exchange of a dilaton and appears because the su-

pergravity modes which couple to constant gauge elds on the brane have zero momentum

along the brane [27].

3.3. instanton eects and the static quark-antiquark potential from supergravity

in this section we study the static quark-antiquark potential, in the large || region
where the background geometry described above is valid. this corresponds to studing the

eects of instantons on the static quark-antiquark potential in the eld theory. there is a

large body of evidence from lattice calculations that indicate that instanton eects play a

major role in the physics of light hadrons[28]. below we will argue that the supergravity

description provides a powerful new approach to these questions.

the energy of a quark-antiquark pair can be read o of the expectation value of

a wilson loop. this wilson loop is identied with a fundamental string ending on the

boundary of the asymptotically ads5 space[29]. the wilson loop conguration is thus
obtained by minimizing the nambu-goto action3

s =

2 z d dz qgm n xm xn

the metric gm n felt by the strings is not the einstein metric (2.8), but rather the string
frame metric. we are interested in a static string conguration and take  = x1 and
 = x0. the string is at a xed x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7 and  where  is the angular variable
in the (8, 9) plane. in terms of the variable r2  aa, the nambu-goto action takes the
form

where t = r d . we have dropped terms of o(r4) in the square root above. the solution

to the euler-lagrange equations of motion following from this action is obtained in the

usual way: the action does not depend explicitly on  so that the hamiltonian in the 

direction is a constant of the motion

the string endpoints are at the boundary of the asymptotically ads5 space (r  ) so

the energy is now computed by evaluating our action at this classical solution. after

to extract the dependence of this energy on the quark-antiquark separation l we need to

determine r0 as a function of l. the expression for the energy given above is identical to the
static potential for the quark-antiquark pair in the n = 4 theory at nite temperature[30].
from the results of [30] we know that e(l) has the form

e = 

c1
l  c2l3.

the constant c1 is positive.

in the limit that mi  0, c2  0 and we regain the 1
l
dependence, a fact which is determined by conformal invariance. the sign of the constant

c2 is dependent on . for c2 positive (negative) we have a screening (antiscreening) of the

quark-antiquark pair due to the instantons. this expression cant be trusted for very large

l: for larger and larger l the wilson loop is able to move further and further into the bulk.

our solution is however only valid for large r, so that the wilson loop begins to explore

regions in the bulk for which our solution is not valid. the long distance behaviour of the

quark-antiquark potential could be extracted from the exact supergravity background.

4. pure gauge n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su (2)

in this section we obtain the leading correction to the four derivative terms in both

the eld theory and the supergravity descriptions.

4.1. field theory results

in the case where there are no avor multiplets, the perturbative beta function does

not vanish and the eld theory is asymptotically free. we will focus attention on the

perturbative contributions to the two and four derivative terms appearing in the low energy
eective action. the one loop results for the kahler metric and real function h are

k  

log( /2)

 

,

h(a, a)  log(cid:16) a

(cid:17) log(cid:16)

a
(cid:17).

this leads to the following four derivative term for the scalars, after performing the eld

redenition[7]

8 + 4 log(cid:16)

the ||4 fall o at large separations (large ||) suggests that the dominant interaction be-
tween the branes is again due to the exchange of massless supergravity modes propagating

in the six dimensional space transverse to the three branes.

4.2. supergravity results

the problem of nding the relevant background geometry corresponding to the asymp-

totically free gauge theory is considerably more complicated. the laplace equation (2.10)

becomes

we have not been able to solve this equation exactly. however an approximate solution in
the large |a| region is given by

(aa)2log|a|(cid:17).

this is exactly the same behaviour as obtained from the eld theory analysis.

the complex coupling  in this supergravity background has a logarithmic dependence

on aa corresponding to the logarithmic dependence of the eld theory coupling on the

energy scale. gravity solutions that have couplings with this logarithmic dependence have

been constructed in type-0 theories[31].

we should now address the validity of this computation. there are two potential

sources of corrections to the supergravity description - string loop eects and curvature

corrections. at large n and large t hooft coupling both of these types of corrections

are small and supergravity is a reliable description. as the t hooft coupling decreases,

curvature corrections become important and the uncorrected supergravity can no longer

be trusted[32]. the uncorrected supergravity does not correctly describe the large n

perturbative eld theory. we would like to determine wether the uncorrected supergravity

is a valid description for the perturbative eld theory living on the probe, which is a

dierent question. the simplest way to asses the validity of the supergravity description

is simply to compute the square of the ricci tensor. this calculation should be carried in

string frame because we are interested in the region in which the dilaton is going to zero.
we will show both the einstein and string frame results in what follows. in the large |a|
region the einstein frame metric that we have computed above take the form4

4 in what follows ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3; i, j = 4, 5, 6, 7 and m, n = 0, 1, ..., 9.

16

g(e)
m n dxm dxn = aa log |a|dxdx +

1

aa log |a|(cid:16)ij dxidxj + log|a|dada(cid:17).

the corresponding string frame metric is

g(s)
m n dxm dxn = aa(log|a|)1/2 dxdx +

1

aa(log|a|)3/2(cid:16)ij dxidxj + log|a|dada(cid:17).

the leading contribution to the square of the ricci tensor in the einstein frame is a constant

rm n rm n =

32
n

.

in the string frame, the leading contribution to the square of the ricci tensor diverges
logarithmically for large |a|

rm n rm n =

32
n

log|a|.

to interpret these results, note that the yang-mills coupling squared is g2 = (log|a|)1,
so that the t hooft coupling is   g2n = n/ log|a|. we see that the square of the ricci
tensor in the string frame is inversely proportional to the t hooft coupling, so that we

recover the well known result that curvature eects are small at large . the coupling
for the probe worldvolume eld theory is g2, so that the perturbative probe eld theory is
valid for |a| >> 1. it is clear that in the n   limit, large  and large |a| are compatible,
i.e. in the large n limit, the t hooft coupling is large even when the coupling of the probe
worldvolume eld theory is small. moving to smaller |a| one would need to correct the
asymptotic solution we have found. the supergravity solution in this region captures the

strong coupling dynamics of the asymptotically free gauge theory on the probe.

finally, we note that the eects that we have computed in this section are linear in

both the number of source branes and the number of probe branes. the supergravity will

not capture eects which do not have this linear dependence.
