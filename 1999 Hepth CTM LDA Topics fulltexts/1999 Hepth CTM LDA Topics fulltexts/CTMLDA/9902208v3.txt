abstract

we present the explicit forms of supergravity solutions for the various inter-
secting two bps branes in eleven and ten dimensions, where one brane is localized
at the delocalized other brane. our partially localized supergravity solutions de-
scribe brane congurations in the near horizon region of the delocalized branes,
where the two constituent branes meet in the overall transverse space and the
delocalized branes coincide. we also give the brane worldvolume interpretations
for some of such supergravity solutions.

1 introduction

over the past years, there has been active development in constructing classical su-
pergravity solutions of p-branes and other solitons in string theories. such classical
solutions in string theories made it possible to study quantum aspects of black holes
such as statistical interpretation of black hole entropy and absorption and decay rates
of black holes within the framework of string theories.
in such studies, black holes
are regarded as being obtained by wrapping (intersecting) higher-dimensional p-branes
around compact manifolds. in the course of compactifying p-branes, the supergravity
solutions become delocalized along the compactied directions 2, which include rel-
ative transverse directions (the transverse directions which are longitudinal to some
of other constituent branes) and possibly some of overall transverse directions. so,
the corresponding intersecting p-brane solutions in higher dimensions become localized
only along the overall transverse directions. the most of intersecting brane solutions
that have been constructed are such delocalized type. for the purpose of studying
black hole physics in string theories, mostly it has been therefore sucient to consider
delocalized intersecting brane solutions.

in the recent ads/cft correspondence conjecture [1] and its generalizations (for
example [2, 3, 4]), supergravity solutions in string theories also play important roles.
in this conjecture, the decoupling limits of the worldvolume theories of brane cong-
urations are dual to the supergravity or superstring theories on the manifolds of the
near horizon geometry of the corresponding supergravity brane solutions. thereby, one
can understand gauge theories, which are the decoupling limits (where massive string
modes, the kaluza-klein (kk) modes and gravity modes decouple from the massless
modes of open strings) of the worldvolume theories of d-branes and other solitons, in
terms of the supergravity or superstring theories on the near horizon manifolds, and
vice versa. in the d-brane interpretation of gauge theories, the transverse locations
of d-branes are interpreted as moduli of the gauge theories. for example, transverse
locations of n numbers of d-branes, which are interpreted as scalar elds in the u(n)
gauge theories, parameterize the coulomb branch. when more than one types of branes
intersect, whereas locations of the light d-branes are dynamical moduli, locations of
the heavy branes become couplings, i.e. mass of quarks, since the kinetic energy of
their excitations is innite, thereby being frozen at their classical values.

therefore, if the ads/cft correspondence (or generally bulk/boundary holographic

2when compactifying the supergravity solutions, one has to take an innite uniform array of branes
along the directions to be compactied in order to have an isometry necessary for the compactication.
also, by denition, compactication means the identication of the corresponding points in each cell
of the compactication lattice, thereby the branes are periodically distributed along the compacti-
ed directions. therefore, in the small size limit of the compactication manifold, the supergravity
solutions become delocalized along the compactied directions.

correspondence) is correct, then all the parameters of the gauge theories, which are
boundary theories at innity of the ads/cft correspondence, have to be mapped one-
to-one to the corresponding parameters of the corresponding supergravity solutions in
the bulk, namely the locations of the constituent branes along the transverse directions.
however, in delocalized intersecting p-brane solutions, locations of constituent branes
along the worldvolume directions of the other branes are not specied, thereby not
suitable for studying the bulk/boundary correspondence.

some attempts have been made to construct localized intersecting brane solutions
[5, 6, 7] with the restricted metric ansatz which has the same form as the corresponding
delocalized intersecting bps brane solutions. consistency of equations of motion along
with such simplied metric ansatz requires that one of the branes has to be delocalized
on the relative transverse directions. even with such simplied metric ansatz, however,
obtaining the explicit analytical form of localized solutions is almost an impossible
task, since harmonic functions 3 that specify constituent branes now satisfy coupled
partial dierential equations instead of the laplaces equations in the at (overall)
transverse space. solutions to such dierential equations in general do not have simple
explicit form in terms of elementary functions.
in the case of localized intersecting
non-extreme brane solutions, even the metric ansatz (in terms of harmonic functions)
which would generalize such restricted metric ansatz for the bps case is not known,
not to mention the explicit expressions for harmonic functions. partially localized
intersecting brane solutions, where constituent branes are localized along the relative
transverse directions but delocalized along the overall transverse directions, have been
constructed [8, 9, 10, 11]. however, these solutions satisfy dierent intersecting rules
from the ordinary intersecting branes and therefore they are only useful for studying
brane congurations with exotic intersecting rules.

however, in some special cases in the near-core limit of one of constituent branes,
one can construct explicit solutions. the rst attempt was made in ref.
[12], where
the use was made of the fact that the near-core limit or the large charge limit of the kk
monopole in d = 11 is m (6,1) times an an 1 singularity, which can be obtained from
the d = 11 at spacetime by the zn identication. after the dimensional reduction,
this an 1 singularity metric becomes near-horizon limit of either d6-branes or the kk
monopole in d = 10. since an an 1 singularity is ricci at (thereby satisfying the
einsteins equations), one can just replace the at transverse space of m-branes by an
an 1 singularity. after the compactication down to d = 10, the resulting solutions
are localized brane solutions in the core of either d6-branes or the kk monopoles. the
other type of localized intersecting brane solutions that were explicitly constructed is
g i(ggijj)f (xi) =
0, where g  det(gij). but in the following we will continue to call the solutions to such coupled
dierential equations as harmonic functions.

3harmonic function is dened as a solution f (xi) to the laplaces equation 1

2

the d(1)-brane solution in the core of d3-brane [13, 14, 15, 16]. in this case, it was
possible to obtain the explicit form of the harmonic function for d(1)-brane, since
the equations of motion reduce to the laplaces equation in the background of the
near-horizon geometry of d3-branes, i.e. ads5 space, which is conformaly at.

one may argue that other localized intersecting bps brane solutions (in the core of
one of the constituents) can be obtained by just applying duality transformations on
the above localized solutions. however, in order to apply t -duality transformations in
the transverse directions 4, one has to rst compactify this direction, which becomes
delocalized through smearing or uniform array of branes along this direction. thereby,
the power of radial coordinate in the harmonic function (of the above d6-brane, kk
monopole and the d3-brane) changes. this implies that after the required delocaliza-
tion along the t -duality direction the near-horizon geometries of d6-brane and d = 10
kk monopole do not get uplifted to an an 1 singularity and the near-horizon geom-
etry of d3-branes is no longer conformaly at. so, the above tricks for constructing
localized intersecting branes cannot be applied. therefore, one has to construct such
localized intersecting bps brane solutions case by case. it is the purpose of this paper
to construct various explicit partially localized intersecting bps brane solutions in the
core of the delocalized constituent in various dimensions. we will apply simple coordi-
nate transformations to the dierential equations satised by the harmonic functions
in order to bring them to the forms of partial dierential equations which have known
explicit solutions.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we setup the general formalism
for constructing partially localized bps intersecting brane solutions where one of the
constituents is delocalized. we will apply this formalism to construct various explicit
partially localized intersecting m-brane solutions in section 3, and various partially
localized intersecting brane solutions in ten dimensions in section 4. also, in sec-
tions 3 and 4, we discuss some worldvolume interpretations of such partially localized
intersecting brane solutions for the purpose of illustrating possible usefulness of our so-
lutions in studying the bulk/boundary holographic correspondence. namely, although
partially delocalized, our solutions still contain the corresponding parameters of the
gauge theories on the boundary, which delocalized intersecting brane solutions lack.
in these sections, we identify the parameters of our supergravity solutions with the

4the t -duality transformations on supergravity brane solutions along the longitudinal directions
are not allowed, since these transformations introduce additional transverse directions, which the re-
sulting transformed supergravity solutions have to depend on. one cannot arbitrarily let the solutions
depend on this new coordinates through naive generalization of the form of the harmonic functions
before the t -duality transformations, as the satisfaction of the eld equations is not always guaran-
teed. in fact, the true localized harmonic functions, which satisfy the equations of motion, take
dierent forms from the harmonic functions before the t -duality transformation on the longitudinal
directions. this can be seen from the various intersecting brane solutions involving d-branes, which
are presented in the following.

2 general setup

in this section, we setup general formalism, which can be applied to any types of inter-
secting branes in any dimensions, for obtaining the explicit expressions for harmonic
functions.

in the bps case, supergravity solutions for partially localized intersecting branes can
be obtained with the same metric ansatze and the same harmonic superposition rules
as the delocalized cases. so, in the following, we shall assume the same forms of the
metric ansatze (which dier for dierent types of constituent branes and therefore will
be given in sections 3 and 4 case by case) as the delocalized intersecting bps branes.
schematically, in general the intersecting brane conguration is given by the following
table. (this table is given also for the purpose of xing the notations for the spacetime
coordinates, which we shall follow in the following sections.)

brane 1
brane 2

t



~w



~x



~z

~y


here, t is the time coordinate, ~w is the possible overall longitudinal coordinate, ~x =
(x1, . . . , xp) [~y = (y1, . . . , yq)] is the relative transverse coordinate for the brane 1
[the brane 2], and ~z = (z1, . . . , zr) is the overall transverse coordinate. generally,
for any type of intersecting brane 1 (with the harmonic function h1 = h1(~x, ~z)) and
brane 2 (with the harmonic function h2 = h2(~y, ~z)) in any dimensions with the above
conguration, the harmonic functions satisfy the following coupled partial dierential
equations 5 [5, 6, 17, 12, 7]:

along with the constraint

2
~z h1 + h22
2
~z h2 + h12

~xh1 = 0,
~y h2 = 0,

~xh1~yh2 = 0.

(1)

(2)

5more precisely, the coordinates ~z, ~x and ~y are the coordinates in which constituent branes are
localized. namely, when some of the coordinates are delocalized due to, for example, dimensional
reduction, the harmonic functions h1 and h2 still satisfy the same coupled dierential equations (1)
but just do not depend on the delocalized coordinates. as will be seen in the following, in some cases
it is necessary to delocalize the conguration along some of the overall transverse directions for the
purpose of localizing one brane to the other. in such cases, ~z is the coordinate in the part of the
overall transverse space where the intersecting branes are localized.

4

the constraint (2), i.e. ~xh1 = 0 or ~yh2 = 0, implies that either (i) the two
branes are delocalized (localized only along the overall transverse directions) or (ii)
while one brane is completely localized the other brane has to be localized along the
overall transverse directions, only. so, the supergravity solutions with the above men-
tioned simplied metric ansatze have such limited description of the microscope brane
congurations on the boundary. however, this is not a disadvantageous situation for
studying bulk/boundary correspondence, since the decoupling limit (where only the
massless modes of open strings, which describe gauge theories, survive) of the brane
worldvolume theories requires delocalization of some types of brane congurations. for
example, for the congurations where one type of branes suspends between other type
of branes, the distance between the latter type of branes has to approach zero so that
the associated massive kk modes on the worldvolume theory of the former branes
decouple from the massless open string modes. so, these directions, which are the
relative transverse directions of the former branes, become delocalized 6.

without loss of generality, for the sake of obtaining harmonic functions, we assume

that the brane 2 is delocalized:

2
~z h1 + h22

~xh1 = 0,

2
~z h2 = 0.

(3)

qi

(3) has the form h2 = 1 + pi

in general, the harmonic function h2 that satises the second dierential equation in
|~z~z0 i|r2 , where ~z0 i are locations of the i-th brane 2
with charge qi. however, in this paper we will consider the case in which the brane
2s coincide at the same location in the overall transverse ~z-directions. this is also
required as the decoupling limit of some types of brane congurations, as pointed out
in the previous paragraph. therefore, we choose the following form of the harmonic
function h2 in the near core region of the brane 2:

h2 =

q
zr2 ,

(4)

where z  |~z~z0| and ~z0 is the location of the stack of n2 brane 2s. there might exist
solutions for the harmonic function h1 in the case where each brane 2s are located
at dierent points along the ~z-directions. however, it may not be possible to nd
expression for h1 in closed form in terms of elementary functions. furthermore, naive
inspection of the structure of the dierential equation satised by h1 seems to indicate
that in general there does not exist a closed form of localized solution for h1 in terms
of elementary functions where brane 1s are located at arbitrary locations along the
~z-directions away from the brane 2.

then, the rst dierential equation in (3) reduces to the following form:

q1z1z(zr1zh1) + 2

~xh1 = 0.

(5)

6we assume here that the directions along which the latter type of branes stack are compactied

with the distance between the stack of the branes being the size of the compactication manifold.

5

in the case where the harmonic function h1 depends on its relative transverse coordi-
nates ~x only through the radial coordinate x  |~x|, this dierential equation becomes
of the following form:

q1z1z(zr1zh1) + xp+1x(xp1xh1) = 0.

(6)

we will rst obtain solution h1 = h1(x, z) to the latter dierential equation (6). this
solution can be easily generalized as a general solution h1 = h1(~x, z) to the former
dierential equation (5).

the dierential equation (6) can be solved by transforming it to either of the follow-

ing forms:

[x a(xx ax) + y b(y y by )]f (x, y ) = 0,

[w c2

w + z d2

z]g(w, z) = 0,

(7)

(8)

where a, b, c and d are real numbers. these two partial dierential equations are
related through the following coordinate transformations:

w = (cid:16) 2c
z = (cid:16) 2d

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

for a localized brane, the corresponding harmonic function has to be of the non-trivial
form which is neither sum nor product of a function of x (or w ) and a function of y
(or z) 7. such non-trivial solutions of the partial dierential equations (7) and (8) are
respectively given by

7obtaining the solutions to the partial dierential equations (7) and (8) by applying the method
of the additive or multiplicative separation of variables is very straightforward. however, when the
harmonic functions are of such forms, either the supergravity solution does not match onto a delta-
function brane source [6] or the point singularity of each term in the harmonic function represents the
brane that is delocalized in the other directions. the possibility of getting solutions with the additive
separation of variables were pointed out in ref. [18]. also, the expressions for harmonic functions in
terms of the innite series of special functions by applying the method of multiplicative separation of
variables were obtained in refs. [17, 19].

where the integration constants in the constant terms have been set to 1 so that the
harmonic functions take ordinary forms. one can solve the dierential equation (6) by
transforming it to the either of the forms (7) and (8).

the dierential equation (6) can be put into the form (7) through the following

change of variables:

x  x = x,

z  y =

|4  r|

4r

z

(13)

resulting in the form (7) with a = p  1 and b = r/(4  r). or the equation (6) can be
put into the form (8) by applying the following change of variables:

x  w =   x

2  p!2p

z  z = " q

(2  r)2#

2r

z2r,

(14)

resulting in the form (8) with c = (2p  2)/(p  2) and d = r/(r  2). therefore,
the harmonic function h1 = h1(x, z) that satises the dierential equation (6) has the
form:

h1(x, z) = 1 +

.

(15)

the rst transformation (13) already indicates that the harmonic function (15) for the
brane 1 localized at the brane 2 is not valid when the dimensionality of the the overall
transverse space is 4 (r = 4). also, the second transformation (14) indicates that
our method cannot be applied when the overall transverse space is two-dimensional
(r = 2), in which case h2 in eq. (4) is logarithmic, and the solution (15) is not valid.
note, as pointed out in the previous paragraph, when the dimensionality r of the
overall transverse space with the coordinates ~z is 4, the coordinate transformations
(13) and the expression (15) for the harmonic function h1 are not valid. the only
non-trivial solution, which is not a product of a function of x and a function of z, to
the dierential equation (6) with r = 4 that we have found so far has the form:

h1(x, z) = 1 + p (x2  pq ln z),

(16)

although this looks quite extraordinary as a harmonic function associated with (local-
ized) branes and this implies that the associated brane is delocalized. however, when
the solution is smeared in one of the overall transverse directions ~z, one can nd more
acceptable expression for the harmonic function h1 from eq. (15) (with r = 3), just
as in ref. [12], which represents brane 1s that are completely localized except for one
delocalized overall transverse direction.

also, for some other intersecting brane congurations to be discussed in the following
sections, we note that the corresponding supergravity solutions become delocalized
since the power in the harmonic function h1 is positive instead of negative. this

7

happens when the overall transverse space has large enough dimensionality, i.e. when
r > 4 as can be seen from eq.
(15). as can be in seen in the general expression
for the harmonic function h1(x, z) in eq. (15), which is valid for any type of brane
(except for the case r = 4) in any spacetime dimensions, such delocalization depends
on the dimensionality of the overall transverse space and possibly that of the relative
transverse space of the brane 1, independently of the dimensionality of the overall
longitudinal space.
if one delocalizes some of the overall transverse directions, the
power in the harmonic function h1 becomes negative, thereby describing the brane 1
that are completely localized except for the delocalized overall transverse directions.

this seems to imply that, if there do not exist other class of localized solutions
(where the brane 1 and the brane 2 meet in the overall transverse space), then the
corresponding microscopic brane congurations have to be delocalized in the relative
transverse directions 8 unless some of the overall transverse directions are delocalized.
so, our delocalized intersecting brane solutions (with r  4) correctly describe the
corresponding delocalized microscope brane congurations on the boundary. on the
other hand, this might be due to our choice of the simplied form of the metric ansatz,
which is the same form as the delocalized solutions. with more general form of metric
ansatz, there might exist completely localized intersecting brane solutions without any
delocalized overall transverse directions.

in the case when some of the overall transverse directions are delocalized for the
purpose of localizing the brane 1 at the brane 2, it is understood in the following
sections that ~z in the harmonic functions is the coordinates for the part of the overall
transverse directions where the brane conguration is localized.

it can be proven that the original dierential equation (5) for the harmonic function

h1 = h1(~x, ~z) is solved by

h1(~x, ~z) = 1 +xi

(17)

where the i-th brane 1 with charge pi is located at (~x, ~z) = (~x0 i, ~z0). note, this general
form of the modied harmonic function for the brane 1 is for the near horizon region
(|~z  ~z0|  0) of the brane 2 when the brane 1 and the brane 2 meet in the overall
transverse space and when all the brane 2s coincide at ~z0.

note, in the above expressions for harmonic functions h1 and h2, q and pi are just
integration constants that result from solving the dierential equations. when one
wants to study the partially localized intersecting brane solutions in this paper within
the frameworks of string or m theory, one has to express the constants q and pi in terms
of the numbers n1 and n2 of the brane 1 and brane 2, and the charge quantization

8this possibility was later studied in ref. [20] by noticing such properties of the solutions presented

in this paper.

8

constants (expressed in terms of the fundamental string scale ls, the string coupling
constant gs, the eleven dimensional planck scale lp, etc.) it turns out that although
the constant q of h2 is proportional to the number n2 of brane 2s, the constant p of
h1 is related to the product n1n2 of the numbers n1 and n2 of brane 1s and brane
2s 9.

when more than two branes intersect, one can apply the above procedure with cou-
pled dierential equations with constraints that generalize (1) and (2). (for example,
see ref. [17].) for such general cases, one may have to transform the coupled partial
dierential equations to one of the following forms:

are respectively given by

in the following sections, we will present the explicit forms of every possible par-
tially localized intersecting two brane solutions in eleven and ten dimensions in the
case when the explicit form of the modied harmonic function can be obtained by
applying the method discussed in this section. localized intersecting brane solutions
in other dimensions can be similarly constructed just by applying the procedure dis-
cussed in this section. all the possible delocalized intersecting brane congurations are
studied in refs.
[21, 22], which we generalize to the localized case. in the following,
we will just write down expressions for spacetime metric and the explicit forms of har-
monic functions, since the expressions for other elds (dilaton and form elds) can be
straightforwardly constructed by applying the same harmonic function superposition
rules as the delocalized intersecting brane cases but now with new localized harmonic
functions replaced.

3 localized intersecting m -branes

in eleven dimensions, the basic constituents of intersecting branes are m2- and m5-
branes, which respectively carry electric and magnetic charges of the three-form eld,

9i would like to thank y. oz for pointing out this point.

9

the kk monopole and the pp-wave. in the following, we write down the spacetime
metrics for all the possible combinations of intersecting pairs of these branes along
with the explicit forms of the harmonic functions.

3.1

intersecting m2- and m5-branes

there are 4 overall transverse directions (r = 4). the m2-branes have 4 relative
transverse directions (p = 4), and the m5-branes have 1 relative transverse direction
(q = 1). since this conguration is interpreted as m2-branes ending on m5-branes,
it is natural to let the solution be delocalized along the relative transverse direction
of the m5-branes. formally, one can however construct solution for the other case, as
well. the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

11 = h 1/3
+h 1

2 h 2/3

5

[(h2h5)1(dt2 + dw2) + h 1

2 dy2 + dz2

1 + . . . + dz2
4],

5 (dx2

1 + . . . + dx2
4)

(22)

where the harmonic functions h2 and h5 are respectively associated with the m2- and
m5-branes. for the purpose of obtaining more physically acceptable form of solution,
we delocalize the solution along one of the overall transverse directions ~z 10. then, the
harmonic functions are given by

h2 = 1 +xi

qi

(|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4p|~z  ~z0|)3 , h5 =

p

|~z  ~z0|

.

(23)

the eective worldvolume theory of the m5-brane is the 5 + 1 dimensional (2, 0)
tensor multiplet containing 5 scalars, an anti-symmetric tensor with self-dual 3-form
eld strength, and 4 chiral fermions. the ends of m2-branes on the m5-branes are
regarded as (self-dual) strings (in the m5-brane worldvolume theory) charged under
this tensor. the charges qi and locations ~x0 i in the above supergravity solution are
related to charges and locations of these strings in the worldvolume theory.

3.2

intersecting two m5-branes

there are 3 overall transverse directions (r = 3) and 2 relative transverse directions
for each m5-brane (p = 2 = q). so, in the core region of one of the m5-branes, the
metric has the following form:

ds2

11 = (h1h2)2/3[(h1h2)1(dt2 + dw2

+h 1

2 (dx2

1 + dx2

2) + h 1

1 (dy2

1 + dy2

2) + dz2

1 + dw2

2 + dw2
3)
1 + dz2

2 + dz2
3],

(24)

10when the solution is completely localized along all the overall transverse directions, the harmonic

function takes an unacceptable form (16) with a logarithm

10

with the harmonic functions given by:

h1 = 1 +xi

pi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4p|~z  ~z0|]2 , h2 =

p

|~z  ~z0|

.

(25)

from the perspective of m5-brane worldvolume theory, the 3-dimensional intersec-
tion is 1/2 supersymmetric 3-branes that carry the self-dual 3-form central charges of
the worldvolume superalgebra of the m5-brane [23]. the parameters pi and ~x0 i are
related to the charges and the locations of these 3-branes in the m5-brane worldvolume
theory.

3.3

intersecting two m2-branes

in this case, there are 6 overall transverse directions (r = 6) and the dimensions of the
relative transverse spaces of both of m2-branes are 2 (p = 2 = q). in the core region
of one of the m2-branes, the solution has the following form:

, h2 =

(28)

so, when 3 overall transverse directions are delocalized, the harmonic function h1, as
well as h2, takes a standard form where branes are localized except for the 3 delocalized
overall transverse directions.

from the perspective of the m2-brane worldvolume theory, the 0 + 1 dimensional
intersection is interpreted as a 0-brane coupled to the zero form central charge in the
worldvolume superalgebra. such 0-brane is charged with respect to the hodge-dual of
a transverse scalar. the parameters ~x0 i and qi are related to the locations and charges
of these worldvolume 0-branes.

3.4 m2-brane with the kk monopole

when the at transverse space of the m2-brane is replaced by the taub-nut terms
of the kk monopole, the spacetime metric takes the following form:

11 = h 2/3

(29)

where the harmonic functions h2 and hk for the m2-brane and the kk monopole and
a 1-form potential a = (ai) satisfy the equations:

2
~z hk = 0,

zihk = ijkzj ak,

~z h2 + hk2
2

~xh2 = 0.

(30)

in the core region of the kk monopole or in the limit of large kk monopole charge,
the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

hk =

qkk
|~z  ~z0|
h2 = 1 +xi

, a = qkk cos d,

qi

(|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4qkk|~z  ~z0|)3 .

(31)

this solution reproduces the one in ref. [12].

the 0-form central charges of the m2-brane worldvolume superalgebra are equivalent
to the space components of the dual 2-forms, which are carried by a worldvolume 2-
branes. this 2-brane is interpreted as the intersection of the m2-brane with the kk
monopole [23]. the locations and the charges of these worldvolume 2-branes are related
to ~x0 i and qi of the above supergravity solutions.

3.5 m5-brane with the kk monopole

when the at transverse space of the m5-brane is replaced by the taub-nut terms
of the kk monopole, the spacetime metric takes the following form:

ds2

11 = h 1/3

5

[dt2 + dw2

3) + h 1

2 + dz2

+hk(dz2

5] + h 2/3

5

[dx2

k (dy + aidzi)2],

(32)

where the harmonic functions h5 and hk for the m5-branes and the kk monopole
and a 1-form potential a = (ai) satisfy the equations:

2
~z hk = 0,

zihk = ijkzj ak,

2
~z h5 + hk2

xh5 = 0.

(33)

in the core region of the kk monopole or in the limit of large kk monopole charge,
the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

hk =

qkk
|~z  ~z0|
h5 = 1 +xi

, a = qkk cos d,

pi

(|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4qkk|~z  ~z0|)3/2 .

(34)

this solution is also constructed in ref. [12].

12

the time component of the 1-form central charge in the m5-brane worldvolume su-
peralgebra can be viewed as the space components of a worldvolume dual 5-form. this
charge is carried by the kk monopole [23]. therefore, this conguration is interpreted
as the m5-brane inside of the kk monopole [24, 25].

3.6 the pp wave in the background of m2-branes

for the pp wave which travels along one of the worldvolume directions, which we choose
to be w, of the m2-brane, the metric takes the following form:

ds2

11 = h 2/3

2

[dt2 + dw2 + dx2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2]
+h 1/3

1 + . . . + dz2

(dz2

8),

2

(35)

with the harmonic functions h2 and hw for the m2-brane and the pp wave satisfying
the following equations:

2
~z h2 = 0,

2
~z hw + h22

xhw = 0.

(36)

in the core region of the m2-brane, the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

q

h2 =

|~z  ~z0|6 , hw = 1 + qw (x2 +

q
4

1

|~z  ~z0|4 ).

(37)

when n of the overall transverse directions are delocalized, the harmonic functions
take the following forms:

h2 =

q

|~z  ~z0|6n , hw = 1 +

qw

[x2 + 4q

(n4)2|~z  ~z0|n4]

.

8n

2(n4)

(38)

so, with 5 of the overall transverse directions delocalized the solutions become localized
except for these delocalized overall transverse directions.

upon dimensional reduction to d = 10, the d = 11 pp-wave becomes d0-brane in
the type-iia theory. the 0-form central charges in the d = 11 pp-wave superalgebra
are decomposed into two sets of the 0-form central charges in the d = 10 d0-brane
superalgebra, which can be respectively interpreted in the transverse 9-space as the
central charges carried by a d4-brane or the kk monopole and a fundamental string
or a d8-branes [23]. when uplifted to d = 11, the resulting congurations are m2-
brane and m5-brane and the kk monopole involving the pp-wave, whose supergravity
solutions are presented in this section and the following sections. on the other hand, the
3-momentum in the m2-brane superalgebra, interpreted as a 0-form in the transverse
8-space, is the null 3-momentum of the pp-wave inside the m2-brane [23]. similarly, the
5-momentum in the m5-brane superalgebra, interpreted as a 0-form in the transverse
5-space, is the null 5-momentum of the d = 11 pp-wave inside of the m5-brane, whose
supergravity solution is given in the next subsection.

13

3.7 the pp-wave in the background of m5-branes

for the pp wave which travels along one of the worldvolume directions, which we choose
to be w, of the m5-brane, the metric takes the following form:

ds2

11 = h 1/3

5

[dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2 + dx2
+h 2/3

1 + . . . + dz2

(dz2

5),

5

1 + . . . + dx2
4]

(39)

with the harmonic functions h5 and hw for the m5-brane and the pp wave satisfying
the following equations:

2
~z h5 = 0,

~z hw + h52
2

~xhw = 0.

(40)

in the core region of the m5-brane, the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

h5 =

p

|~z  ~z0|3 , hw = 1 + qw (x2 +

4p

|~z  ~z0|

).

(41)

when n of the overall transverse directions are delocalized, the harmonic functions
take the following forms:

h5 =

p

|~z  ~z0|3n , hw = 1 +

qw

[x2 + 4p

(n1)2|~z  ~z0|n1]

.

n+1
n1

(42)

so, with 2 of the overall transverse directions delocalized, the solutions become localized
except for these two delocalized overall transverse directions.

the pp-wave localized at the m5-brane is interpreted from the perspective of the
worldvolume theory at the boundary as the neutral (with respect to the self-dual
3-form eld strength in the m5-brane worldvolume theory) string in the m5-brane
worldvolume.

3.8 the pp-wave in the background of the kk monopole

the spacetime metric for the pp wave which propagates in the background of the kk
monopole has the following form:

ds2

11 = dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2 + dx2

1 + dz2

2 + dz2

3) + h 1

k (dy + aidzi)2,

+hk(dz2

1 + . . . + dx2
5

(43)

where the harmonic functions hk and hw for the kk monopole and the pp wave and
a 1-form potential a = (ai) satisfy the equations:

2
~z hk = 0,

zihk = ijkzj ak,

2
~z hw + hk2

~xhw = 0.

(44)

14

in the core region of the kk monopole or in the limit of large kk monopole charge,
the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

qkk
|~z  ~z0|

hw = 1 +

hk =

, a = qkk cos d,

qw

(x2 + 4qkk|~z  ~z0|)7/2 .

(45)

4 intersecting branes in ten dimensions

in ten dimensions, the basic constituents of intersecting branes are d-branes, funda-
mental string, solitonic ns5-brane, the kk monopole and the pp wave. in the follow-
ing, we present intersecting brane congurations of all the possible combinations.

4.1 two dp-branes self-intersecting over (p  2) dimensions
in this case, the overall transverse space has 7  p dimensions and there are 2 relative
transverse directions for both of dp-branes. the spacetime metric has the following
form:

ds2

10 = (h1h2)1/2(dt2 + dw2
1 + dy2

1 h 1/2

+h 1/2

1 + . . . + dw2

1 h 1/2
1 + . . . + dz2

(dx2
7p),

2

1 + dx2
2)

(46)

where the harmonic functions h1 and h2 for each dp-branes satisfy the following
equations:

the harmonic functions are therefore given by

2
~z h1 + h22

~xh1 = 0,

2
~z h2 = 0.

h1 = 1 +xi

qi
[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q
(p3)2|~z  ~z0|p3]

2

p3

, h2 =

q

|~z  ~z0|5p .

(47)

(48)

note, for p = 2, this solution becomes delocalized. so, one has to delocalize some
of the overall transverse directions to obtain supergravity solution representing the
intersecting brane localized except for the delocalized overall transverse directions.
when the overall transverse space is 4-dimensional, i.e. self-intersecting d3-branes,
the above expression for the harmonic function h1 is singular. in this case, one has
to delocalize one of the overall transverse directions. with two [one] overall transverse
directions are delocalized for p = 2 [for p = 3], the harmonic functions are given by:

h1 = 1 +xi

qi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|]2 , h2 =

q

|~z  ~z0|

.

(49)

15

the dp-brane worldvolume theory contains a scalar (interpreted as a goldstone
mode of spontaneously broken translational invariance by the dp-brane), which is
hodge-dualized to a worldvolume (p1)-form potential that the (p2)-brane (common
intersection of the two dp-branes) couples to.

4.2 dp-branes ending on d(p + 2)-branes

there are 6 p overall transverse directions. the dimensions of the relative transverse
space are 3 for dp-branes and 1 for d(p + 2)-branes. since dp-branes stretch between
d(p+2)-branes, it is natural to let d(p+2)-branes to be delocalized along their relative
transverse direction. the spacetime metric is given by

ds2

10 = (hphp+2)1/2(dt2 + dw2

where the harmonic functions hp and hp+2 for dp- and d(p + 2)-branes satisfy

2
~z hp + hp+22

~xhp = 0,

2
~z hp+2 = 0.

the harmonic functions are given by

hp = 1 +xi

qi
[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q

, hp+2 =

(p+2)
2(p2)

(51)

(52)

the uctuations of locations ~x0 i of the dp-branes along the d(p + 2)-brane di-
rections, together with the y-component of the dp-worldvolume gauge eld, forms a
massless hypermultiplet with free boundary conditions at y = 0. the scalars describing
the uctuations of location ~z0 of the dp-branes along the directions perpendicular to
the d(p + 4)-branes, together with the t- and ~w-components of the dp-worldvolume
gauge eld, form a vectormultiplet with each component eld satisfying the dirichlet
boundary conditions.

from the point of view of the d(p+2)-branes, the ends of the dp-branes are charged
objects in the d(p+2)-brane worldvolume. for d1-branes ending on d3-branes (p = 1
case), the ends of the d1-branes are magnetic sources for the d3-brane worldvolume
gauge elds. therefore, the worldvolume theory is the magnetic monopoles in the
4-dimensional u(np+2) yang-mills theory. the locations ~x = ~x0 i of the d1-branes

along the directions of the d3-branes, together with the wilson lines of the pi np i

u(1) worldvolume gauge elds of d1-branes along the y-direction, parameterize the
monopole moduli space. the charges qi of the d1-branes are interpreted as magnetic
charges of the monopoles. under the s-duality of the type-iib theory, this supergravity
brane solution transforms to the supergravity solution for fundamental strings ending

16

on d3-branes, which is presented in the following subsection. from the d3-brane
worldvolume point of view, this s-duality is the montonen-olives strong-weak cou-
pling electric-magnetic duality of the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory in 4 dimensions.
the ends of the fundamental strings on the d3-branes are electric charge sources, inter-
preted as charged gauge bosons. just as the d1-brane and the fundamental string form
a multiplet under the type-iib s-duality, the charged gauge boson and the magnetic
monopole transform as a multiplet under the montonen-olive duality.

when p = 1, the above harmonic function hp represents delocalized dp-branes,
thereby requiring delocalization of some of overall transverse directions. when p = 2,
the overall transverse space is 4-dimensional. so, one of the overall transverse directions
has to be delocalized. with two [one] of the overall transverse directions delocalized
for the p = 1 [p = 2] case, harmonic functions are given by:

hp = 1 +xi

qi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|]

, hp+2 =

(53)

4.3 dp-branes inside of the worldvolume of d(p + 4)-branes

there are 5  p overall transverse directions. the dimensionalities of the relative
transverse spaces are 4 for dp-branes and 0 for d(p + 4)-branes. the spacetime metric
has the following form:

ds2

p) + h 1/2

p h 1/2

p+4 (dx2

(54)

10 = (hphp+4)1/2(dt2 + dw2

+(hphp+4)1/2(dz2

1 + . . . + dw2
5p),

1 + . . . + dz2

where the harmonic functions hp and hp+4 for dp- and d(p + 4)-branes satisfy the
dierential equations:

2
~z hp + hp+42

~xhp = 0,

2
~z hp+4 = 0.

the harmonic functions are therefore given by

hp = 1 +xi

qi
[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q
(p1)2|~z  ~z0|p1]

p+1
p1

, hp+4 =

q

|~z  ~z0|3p .

(55)

(56)

the decoupling limit of the worldvolume theory of the corresponding microscopic

d-brane conguration is (i) the (p + 1)-dimensional u(pi np i) gauge theory with
np+4 avors (in the fundamental representation of u(pi np i)) with the u(np+4) gauge

symmetry of the d(p + 4)-branes being a global symmetry from the point of view of
dp-branes, or (ii) small u(np+4) instantons from the point of view of d(p + 4)-branes

with pi np i dp-branes being pointlike defects in the fundamental of u(np+4).

17

from the point of view of the worldvolume theory of the dp-branes, the locations of
the branes are interpreted as follows. the locations of the d(p + 4)-branes relative to
the locations of dp-branes in the ~z-direction are masses ~mj (j = 1, . . . , np+4) for the
np+4-fundamentals. since all the d(p + 4)-branes coincide in the above supergravity
solution, the full u(np+4) symmetry is left intact, while the quarks in the fundamental
of u(np+4) remain massless. the locations ~x0 i of dp-branes parallel to the d(p + 4)-

since all the dp-branes coincide in the direction ~z transverse to the d(p + 4)-branes

in the case of p = 3, i.e.

branes correspond to expectation values of an adjoint hypermultiplet of u(pi np i).
at ~z = ~z0 (parameterizing the coulomb branch of the u(pi np i) gauge theory) for the
above supergravity solution, the full u(pi np i) gauge symmetry is left unbroken.

intersecting d3- and d7-branes, one has to include the
orientifold 7 plane with 8 units of d7-brane charge in order to cancel the brane charges.
then, the d3- and d7-branes have to located in pairs as mirror images of the orientifold
plane along the ~z-directions. note, the ground state of an open string that stretches
between the same d3-brane is the neutral gauge boson w 3
 , whereas those that stretch
between a pair of d3-brane and its mirror image are the charged gauge bosons w 
 .
since all the d3-branes in the above supergravity solution 11 coincide in the ~z-direction,
these charged gauge bosons are massless and therefore the full su(2) gauge symmetry
on the worldvolume of d3-branes is left unbroken. since the relative locations of
d7-branes and their mirror images with respect to d3-brane locations along the ~z-
direction is zero, the quarks are massless and the so(8) symmetry on the worldvolume
of d7-branes remains unbroken.

the p = 2 case is the supergravity solutions for d2-branes within d6-branes con-
structed in ref. [12]. the above solution becomes singular for p = 1 and delocalized
for p = 0. after one [two] of the overall transverse directions are delocalized for p = 1
[for p = 0], the harmonic functions take the following forms:

hp = 1 +xi

qi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|]3 , hp+4 =

q

|~z  ~z0|

.

(57)

one can also obtain the localized bps solution for d(1)-branes in the background
of d3-branes (the p = 1 case) applying the the general formalism in section 2,
although the harmonic function for the d(1)-brane is shown to satisfy the laplaces
equation in the ads5 space. after the wick rotation to the euclidean time coordinate

11when p = 3, the harmonic function h7 for the d7-branes has to be logarithmic. therefore, the
solution (56) is not valid and one cannot obtain the explicit expression for the harmonic functions
applying the method discussed in section 2. however, there might exist the explicit expressions for
harmonic functions where all the d-branes coincide in the ~z-direction. on the other hand, such
supergravity solution cannot be trusted since the conservation of brane charges requires that there
can be only 4 d3-branes and 4 d7-branes.

(58)

and the dilaton and the 0-form eld in the rr sector are respectively given by e = h1
and (  ) = (e  e). here, the subscript  denotes the value of a eld at
the ads5 boundary. the harmonic functions h1 and h3 for the d(1)-branes and
d3-branes satisfy the following equations:

~z h1 + h32
2

~xh1 = 0,

2
~z h3 = 0,

(59)

where ~x = (x0, . . . , x3) now the time coordinate x0 =  included. this system of partial
dierential equations cannot be solved by applying the method discussed in section 2.
but it can be easily proved that the following harmonic functions satisfy (59):

h1 = 1 +xi

qi|~z  ~z0|4

[|~x  ~x0 i|2|~z  ~z0|2 + q]4 , h3 =

q

|~z  ~z0|4 .

(60)

this is the solution constructed in ref.
[15], where the radial coordinate z = |~z 
~z0| in (60) is the inverse of that in their solution. the worldvolume theory of the
corresponding microscopic d-brane conguration is the multi-yang-mills instantons in
the 4-dimensional u(n3) gauge theory with the instanton with the instanton number
n1 i located at ~x = ~x0 i. since the d(1)-brane is located at the position where the
d3-branes coincide, the size of the yang-mills instantons is innite [26].

4.4 fundamental strings ending on dp-branes

there are 8  p overall transverse directions. the fundamental strings have p relative
transverse directions and the dp-branes have 1 relative transverse direction.
it is
natural to let the solution to be delocalized along the relative transverse direction of
the dp-branes. the spacetime metric has the following form:

note that for p < 4 the above solution becomes delocalized and for p = 4 the solution
becomes singular. after 5p overall transverse directions are delocalized, the harmonic
functions take the following forms:

representing fundamental strings localized except for the delocalized 5p overall trans-
verse directions.

for p = 3, this supergravity solution is s-dual to the d-strings ending on d3-branes
discussed in the previous section. once again, the ends of the fundamental strings are
interpreted as (electrically) charged gauge bosons in the worldvolume gauge theory of
the d3-branes.

4.5 dp-branes ending on n s5-branes

there are 3 overall transverse directions. the dimensions of the relative transverse
spaces are 6  p for dp-branes and 1 for ns5-branes. it is natural to delocalize in
the direction relatively transverse to the ns5-branes. the spacetime metric for the
dp-branes (p  6) ending on ns5-branes is given by

the equations:

~xhp = 0,

~z hn s = 0.

(66)

(67)

the p = 6 case is the supergravity solution for ns5-branes within d6-branes con-
structed in ref. [12].

since the y-direction, in which the ns5-branes stack, is delocalized, one can think
of the ns5-branes as being periodically arrayed in the y-direction with the periodic-
ity given by the circumference of the compactication circle. the scalars describing
the uctuations of the location ~z = ~z0 of the dp-branes in the perpendicular direc-
tions to the ns5-branes, along with the y-component of the dp-worldvolume gauge
eld, form the hypermultiplet. the scalars corresponding to the locations ~x = ~x0 i of
the dp-branes in the parallel directions of the ns5-branes, together with the t- and

20

~x-components of the dp-worldvolume gauge eld, form the vector multiplet. since
the dp-branes are nite in y, the worldvolume gauge theory is eectively 1 + (p  1)
dimensional with the kaluza-klein excitations on the dp-branes invisible at large dis-
tances. for p = 3, 4, the corresponding worldvolume theory is 1 + (p  1) dimensional
qn5
i=1 u(n4) supersymmetric gauge theory with n5 (bifundamental) hypermultiplets
transforming in the (n4, n4) of u(n4)  u(n4). here, each u(n4) gauge group is
associated with n4 dp-branes that stretch between two adjacent ns5-branes.

4.6 fundamental strings with n s5-branes

for fundamental strings parallel to ns5-branes, there are 4 overall transverse direc-
tions. so, the delocalization along one of the overall transverse directions is required.
the fundamental strings have 4 relative transverse directions and the ns5-branes have
no relative transverse direction. the metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = h 1

f (dt2 + dw2) + dx2

1 +    + dx2

4 + hn s(dz2

1 +    + dz2
4),

(68)

where the harmonic functions hf and hn s for the fundamental strings and the ns5-
branes satisfy

2
~z hf + hn s2

~xhf = 0,

2
~z hn s = 0.

the harmonic functions are therefore given by

hf = 1 +xi

qi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|]3 , hn s =

q

|~z  ~z0|

.

this solution is also constructed in ref. [12].

4.7 two n s5-branes intersecting over 3 dimensions

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = dt2 + dw2

1 + dw2

2 + dw2

+h2(dy2

1 + dy2

2) + h1h2(dz2

3 + h1(dx2
1 + dz2

1 + dx2
2)
2),

where the harmonic functions h1 and h2 for each ns5-branes satisfy:

2
~z h1 + h22

~xh1 = 0,

2
~z h2 = 0.

(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

the overall transverse space is 2-dimensional. this means that the harmonic function
h2 in eq. (4) has to be logarithmic. so, one cannot construct the localized solution
by applying the method developed in this paper.

4.8 the kk monopole in the transverse space of dp-brane

with p  4.

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = h 1/2

p

(dt2 + dw2

1 + . . . + dw2
3) + h 1

p) + h 1/2

[dx2
k (dy + aidzi)2],

2 + dz2

p

+hk(dz2

1 + dz2

1 + . . . + dx2

5p

(73)

where the harmonic functions hp and hkk for the dp-branes and the kk monopoles
and a 1-form potential a = (ai) satisfy

2
~z hp + hkk2

~xhp = 0,

2
~z hkk = 0,

zihk = ijkzj ak.

(74)

in the core region of the kk monopole or in the limit of large kk monopole charge,
the harmonic functions are given by:

hk =

qkk
|~z  ~z0|
hp = 1 +xi

, a = qkk cos d,

qi

(|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4qkk|~z  ~z0|)

.

7p

(75)

the corresponding worldvolume theory is the one with the at transverse space

replaced by an ale space with ankk 1 singularity.

4.9 the kk monopole in the transverse space of the funda-

mental string

the spacetime metric is given by

ds2

10 = h 1

f (dt2 + dw2) + dx2
2 + dz2
+hk(dz2

1 + dz2

1 + . . . + dx2
4

3) + h 1

k (dy + aidzi)2,

(76)

where the harmonic functions hf and hkk for the fundamental strings and the kk
monopole and a 1-form potential a = (ai) satisfy

2
~z hf + hkk2

~xhf = 0,

2
~z hkk = 0,

zihk = ijkzj ak.

(77)

in the core region of the kk monopole or in the limit of large kk monopole charge,
the harmonic functions are given by:

hk =

qkk
|~z  ~z0|
hf = 1 +xi

, a = qkk cos d,

qi

(|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4qkk|~z  ~z0|)3 .

(78)

the corresponding worldvolume theory is described by a conformal eld theory in

the target manifold including an ale space with ankk 1 singularity.

22

4.10 the kk monopole in the transverse space of the n s5-

brane

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = dt2 + dw2

1 + . . . + dw2

5 + hn s[hk(dz2

1 + dz2

2 + dz2

3) + h 1

k (dy + aidzi)2], (79)

where hn s and hk are the harmonic functions for the ns5-branes and the kk
monopole and a = (ai) is a 1-form potential. there are no relative transverse di-
rections. so, there is no point in considering the localized intersecting conguration.

4.11 the pp wave propagating in the background of the kk

monopole

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2 + dx2

1 + dz2

2 + dz2

3) + h 1

k (dy + aidzi)2,

+hk(dz2

1 + . . . + dx2
4

(80)

where the harmonic functions hk and hw for the kk monopole and the pp wave and
a 1-form potential a = (ai) satisfy the equations:

2
~z hk = 0,

zihk = ijkzj ak,

2
~z hw + hk2

~xhw = 0.

(81)

in the core region of the kk monopole or in the limit of large kk monopole charge,
the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

qkk
|~z  ~z0|

hw = 1 +

hk =

, a = qkk cos d,

qw

(x2 + 4qkk|~z  ~z0|)3 .

(82)

4.12 fundamental string with the pp wave propagating along

its longitudinal direction

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = h 1

f [dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2] + dz2

1 + . . . + dz2
8,

(83)

where hf and hw are respectively the harmonic functions for the fundamental strings
and the pp wave. since there is no relative transverse directions, it is of no point to
discuss the special localized solution.

23

4.13 n s5-brane with the pp wave propagating along one of

its longitudinal directions

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2 + dx2

1 + . . . + dx2
4

+hn s(dz2

1 + . . . + dz2

4),

(84)

with the harmonic functions hn s and hw for the ns5-brane and the pp wave satis-
fying the following equations:

2
~z hn s = 0,

~z hw + hn s2
2

~xhw = 0.

(85)

in the core region of the ns5-brane with one of its overall transverse directions delo-
calized, the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

hn s =

p

|~z  ~z0|

, hw = 1 +

qw

(x2 + 4p|~z  ~z0|)3 .

(86)

4.14 dp-brane with the pp wave propagating along one of its

longitudinal directions

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = h 1/2

p

[dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2 + dx2
+h 1/2

1 + . . . + dz2

9p),

(dz2

p

1 + . . . + dx2

p1]

(87)

with the harmonic functions hp and hw for the dp-brane and the pp wave satisfying
the following equations:

2
~z hp = 0,

2
~z hw + hp2

~xhw = 0.

(88)

in the core region of the dp-branes, the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

hp =

q

|~z  ~z0|7p , hw = 1 +

qw

(x2 + 4q

(p5)2|~z  ~z0|p5)

.

p28p+19

2(p5)

(89)

for the p < 5 the pp wave becomes delocalized and for p = 5 the above solution
becomes singular. after 6  p of the overall transverse directions are delocalized, the
harmonic functions take the following forms:

hp =

q

|~z  ~z0|

, hw = 1 +

qw

(x2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|)3 .

(90)

the p = 6 case is the supergravity solution for the pp wave localized within d6-branes
constructed in ref. [12].
