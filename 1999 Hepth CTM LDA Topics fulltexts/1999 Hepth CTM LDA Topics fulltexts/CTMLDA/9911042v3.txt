abstract

we present a formal supersymmetric solution of type iib supergravity generalizing

previously known solutions corresponding to d3 branes to geometries without an orthog-

onal split between parallel and transverse directions. the metric is given implicitly as

one with respect to which a certain connection is compatible. the case of the deformed

conifold is discussed in detail.

1. introduction and motivation

the ads/cft correspondence in cases with lower supersymmetries involving the

two- and three-dimensional ads spaces is much less understood than the others [1]. in

particular, the near-horizon geometry of black strings in simple ve-dimensional super-

gravity (obtained by compactication of m-theory on a calabi-yau threefold x) is given
by ads2  s2. here we meet a little puzzle discussed also in [2]. the spectrum of the
supergravity theory is dened by h 2(x, zz), and when considering a magnetic string solu-
tion, one naturally writes down a string coupled to (h11(x)1) vectors and a graviphoton.
however as pointed out in [3], the theory on the string is governed by a much larger lattice
dened by h 2(p, zz), where p is the four-cycle around which the m-theory vebrane is
wrapped. in particular, this accounts for a very large entropy. this information about the

cycle is not reected in the kk spectrum though. as seen in [4], the target space of the

dual (0, 4) conformal eld theory is factorized. the coupling to supergravity is governed

mostly by the so called universal sector, while the numerous modes making up the theory

on the two-dimensional worldsheet are in the entropic sector. apparently, the usual proce-

dure of compactifying m-theory and then looking for the solutions misses the deformations
of the cycle. in doing so we simply nd a solution corresponding to the universal sector1,

and schematically we can write

[compactication, solution] = entropic sector.

finding a complete solution with all the modes seems to be extremely hard. instead, we

try to give a description of the 10d geometry corresponding to the situation in [6]: a d-

brane wrapping a non-trivial cycle in an internal calabi-yau space, shrinking to zero-size

at certain points of the moduli space thus turning into a massless bps black hole from the
four dimensional non-compact space point of view2.

d3 branes on conifold points have been discussed extensively in the ads literature

recently [7,8,9,10]. however only the situation where the branes are transverse to a cy

manifold, and can be thought of as spacetime-lling, has been addressed there. we will be

concerned with a rather dierent geometrical setup, the case of a d3 wrapping a 3-cycle

in an internal cy threefold.

1 the full entropy is recovered by loop corrections to supergravity [5].
2 note that n d3-branes do not form a bound state on the conifold. to ensure the reliability

of supergravity we are tacitly assuming that n is large.

1

in the next two sections, we will outline a procedure for nding formal supersym-

metric solutions under some general assumptions about the metric in the absence of d3.

unfortunately, the metric of the solution is only given implicitly as one with respect to

which a certain connection is compatible.

as a specic case, we will consider type iib supergravity on a non-compact calabi-
yau threefold which we will call the deformed conifold c(). in doing this we are able to
avoid the question of extra modes since in our limiting case the three-fold is approximated
by t s3 and s3 is rigid. the deformed conifold, which will be described in the following
in some detail, is topologically a 6d cone over an s2  s3 base, whose apex is replaced by
an s3.

before turning to the concrete example of d3 on a shrinking s3 cycle in section 5, we
discuss the geometry of the singular and deformed conifolds of [11]. using the machinery

of coset-space geometry [12,13], we are able to give an explicit form of the deformed

conifold metric presented implicitly in [11]. a possible generalization to m2 and m5 cases

is discussed in section 6.

2. branes on cycles

we present a method for constructing formal supersymmetric solutions of type iib

supergravity corresponding to d3 branes, which generalizes previously known solutions to

geometries without an orthogonal split between directions parallel and transverse to the

brane. in particular, we do not assume that the d3 is spacetime-lling but our method

covers this situation as a special case.

in the presence of the d3 the 10d geometry will get deformed to account for the back

reaction due to the brane. this back reaction is captured by the warping factor, a function

of the coordinates transverse to the brane. there is considerable amount of literature on

the subject of supergravity solutions corresponding to branes (see e.g.

[14,15]). these

solutions assume that in the absence of d3 there is an orthogonal split of the 10d metric

along parallel and transverse to the brane directions:

ds2 =  dxdx + gmn(y)dymdyn

(2.1)

where  is the (at) metric on the cycle around which the d3 will wrap (which in that
case is the whole 4d minkowski spacetime) and gmn(y) is the transverse metric. in the
presence of the d3, the geometry is modied

ds2 = (y) dxdx + ||(y)gmn(y)dymdyn

(2.2)

2

where (y), ||(y) are the warping factors (which turn out to be related) and are func-
tions only of the coordinates transverse to the brane.

here we will not assume that there is the nice split of the form (2.1). instead we

will take the 10d metric in the absence of d3 to be of the form

ds2 = g(x, )dxdx + f 2(u )du 2 +

5xa=1

(e(x, , u )a

dx + e(x, , u )a

idi)2

(2.3)

where {x;  = 0, . . . 3} are the coordinates parametrizing a non-trivially embedded cycle
c, u is a radial coordinate in the transverse space and {i; i, . . . 5} are angular co-
ordinates in the transverse space. the metric on c is g and it does not depend on u .
note that e(x, , u )a
 encodes the deviations from orthogonally-split geometries. we will

further assume that

e(x, , u = 0)a

 = e(x, , u = 0)a

i = 0,

(2.4)

so that c is at u = 0. if we wish, we may consider u as a collective label for a set of
radial  coordinates u1, u2, . . . which enter metric (2.3) as f 2
2 + . . .
for simplicity we will drop the  dependence of g in the following. all our arguments
of section 3 go through for -dependent g as well. let us remark that if we keep the
 dependence, it appears that in the at d3 limit we may recover warped ads5  ws5
products. the possibility of such supergravity vacua has been known for some time [16,17],

1 (u1)du 2

1 + f 2

2 (u2)du 2

however these havent appeared as brane near-horizon limits so far. this discussion may

provide a brane realization of such vacua.

the metric of (2.3) is of some generality. a trivial example would be the case where

the 10d metric is that of a direct sum of 4d minkowski plus a 6d cone, with u being the

distance (in the ten-dimensional sense) from the apex. another example, which will be
discussed in the following, is the geometry of the deformed conifold near the s3 at the

apex.

3. the solution

in this section we will discuss how does (2.3) change in the presence of a d3 along
c. as already emphasized, the solution will be given implicitly: the metric in the pres-
ence of d3 is the metric with respect to which the connection of equation (3.8) below,

is metric compatible. this statement makes sense since for every torsion-free connection

with so(n ) holonomy (where n is the dimension of the manifold) there is an essentially

3

unique metric with respect to which the connection is compatible. we can see this as
follows: take the metric at a given point to be some constant symmetric n  n matrix.
parallel-transport it using the connection to dene the metric at any other point. the

absence of inconsistencies under parallel transport along closed loops is equivalent to the

requirement of so(n ) holonomy. the metric constructed in this way is dened up to rigid

gl(n, ir) coordinate transformations.

we want to warn the reader that as we do not have the charge distribution explicitly,

nothing excludes the possibility that this solution corresponds to a completely smeared
d3. in that case it would be wrong to think of the d3 as wrapping c. it is more correct
to say that c will be identied with the horizon in the presence of the d33.

3.1. conventions

,  are curved indices for the directions along the d3.

m, n are curved indices for the coordinates transverse to the d3 including u.

i, j are curved indices for the coordinates transverse to the d3 excluding u.

m, n are ten-dimensional curved indices.

,  are at indices for the directions along the d3.

a, b are at indices corresponding to the directions transverse to the d3 excluding u.
 is the at index corresponding to u .
a, b are ten-dimensional at indices.

3.2. the solution

it will be useful to give the coframe version of (2.3):

where

ds2 =

3x=0

(e)2 +

5xa=1

e =e(x)

dx; e = e(u )u du = f (u )du

(3.2)

the elds of iib are the graviton gm n , a complex scalar  parametrizing an sl(2, ir)/u (1)
coset space, a pair of two-forms b1,2
m n which form an sl(2, ir) doublet, a self-dual four-
form a(4) with eld strength f (5), and two complex-weyl fermions: a gravitino m and a
dilatino .

3 we would like to thank g. moore for explaining this to us.

4

the supersymmetry transformations are parametrized by a complex-weyl spinor 

and, in a background with all elds set to zero except for the graviton and the four-form,

only the gravitino transformation is not identically zero

our ansatz for the ve-form is given in terms of one function of u , c(u )

f0123 = 0123 c(u ); fa1a2a3a4a5 = a1a2a3a4a5c(u )

(3.5)

with all other components equal to zero. we then nd

where

a1...a5 fa1...a5  = i5!c(u )((6) + (4))
a1...a5 fa1...a5 a = i5!c(u )a((6) + (4))

(4) := i=0 . . . =3; (6) := ia=1 . . . a=5

(3.7)

are the parallel and transverse chirality operators. let a

b be the connection one-
form associated to the metric (3.1). our ansatz for the 10d metric in the presence of the
d3 will be given implicitly by requiring that it be associated to the connection a

b given

by

are two warping factors.

in [7] a relation identical to (3.8) holds, arising from a rescaling of the vielbeins
ea  (a)ea. our case however is very dierent as it does not imply that the associated
metrics are related by such a rescaling. the reason is that, as follows from (3.1), (3.2),
the connection a

b generally has non zero components of the form 

a mixing transverse

with parallel directions.

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

i.e. the solution preserves some supersymmetry provided the geometry (3.1) in the absence

of d3 admits a covariantly constant spinor. the integrability of (3.13) is equivalent to the

requirement of ricci-atness for the geometry in the absence of d3.

we simply substitute (3.8) into (3.15) taking (3.14) into account. the result is [18,7]:

d()u d()u (u )2 = 0

(3.16)

this is the condition that (u )2 is harmonic. in proving the above we used the fact that
(3.17)

 = 0

we can see this as follows. from (3.1) we get

0 = d(e(u )u du ) = de = e  aea

(3.18)

therefore the only possibly nonzero components of  are of the form . on the other
hand

de = 

e + . . . = 



e  e + . . .

(3.19)

but since u e = 0, de cannot have a piece proportional to du and we conclude that
 = 0.

4. geometry of conifolds

the main purpose of this section is to provide a specic example of the geometrical

setup under which our solution of the previous section is valid. indeed we show (see subsec.

4.5) that the near-horizon limit of the deformed conifold is a particular case to which our

method applies.

none of this section is new. the results are in principle contained in previous works

[11,12,13]. however we want to draw the attention of the reader to two points. equation

(4.15) below, contains a term (the one proportional to b) which is usually omitted from
discussions in the literature related to t 1,1 spaces. however this term appears naturally

in the metric of the deformed conifold, explicitly presented in equation (4.35). in section 5

of [11] the metric is given implicitly in terms of 7 variables (one radius and 6 euler angles)

in a form which makes it dicult to distinguish 6 independent ones. for these reasons we

think the discussion of this section is useful.

4.1. t p,q spaces

a cone cd+1 in d + 1 spacetime dimensions over a d-dimensional base xd is given by

ds2 = d2 + 2gijdxidxj

(4.1)

the cone cd+1 has the property that the vector / is conformally killing. the metric
gij; i, j = 1 . . . d determines the geometry of the base. cd+1 is ricci-at i xd is einstein
with cosmological constant (d  1) and is irregular at  = 0 unless xd = sd.

our situation corresponds to d=5 and we will consider the base to be a t 1,1 space.
a t 1,1 space is a particular example of t p,q spaces [19]. these can be thought of as u (1)
brations over s2  s2. let 0  i  2 ,0  i   , i = 1, 2 parametrize the two s2
and let 0  i  4 be the coordinate on the u (1) ber. the line element of t p,q is then
given by

ds2 =1(d + pcos1d1 + qcos2d2)2

+ 2(sin21d2

2 + d2
2)

1 + d2

1) + 3(sin22d2

(4.2)

where the rst term on the rhs is the vertical displacement along the bre and the other
two terms are the line elements on the s2s. by forgetting one of the s2s the t 1,1
space can be thought of as an s3 bration over s2 -the base being the s2 we forget and

7

the bre being a u (1) bration over the other s2. this bration is actually trivial 4 and
therefore t 1,1 is topologically s2  s3.

(4.4)

the spaces t p,q also have a coset description as su (2)su (2)/u (1), which is another
way to see the s2  s3 topology. it will pay o to make a digression on the geometry of
coset spaces which will eventually help us give a useful description of the deformed conifold.

for a more comprehensive account one should consult the literature [12,13].

4.2. the geometry of coset spaces.

in this section we use techniques of coset spaces to give a generalization of the metric
(4.2). this generalized metric for t 1,1 will appear naturally in the following when we

discuss the deformed conifold.

consider a lie group g and a subgroup h  g generated by {hi; i = 1 . . . dimh}

such that g is generated by {hi, ea; a = 1 . . . dimg  dimh} and

[hi, hj] = cij

khk;

[hi, ea] = cia

[ea, eb] = cab

beb;
ded + cab

ihi

(4.5)

we call left cosets the elements of the form g.h, g  g. to parametrize the coset we choose
a particular group element in each coset which we call the coset representative l().

4 there are various way to see this. see for example [8].

8

here {,  = 1 . . . dimg  dimh} are coordinates on g/h. the element l1l, where
 := /, is in the lie algebra of g. the expansion

l1l = ea

ea + i

hi

(4.6)

() and the h-connections i

denes the vielbein ea
(). coset manifolds g/h have at
least an isometry g  n (h)/h, where the latter factor is the normalizer (the largest
subgroup of g of which h is a normal subgroup) and g = g  (u (1) factors common to
g and to n (h)/h).

a metric on g/h preserving the isometries is given by

where hab is an h-invariant tensor

g = habea

chac = 0

(4.7)

(4.8)

as an application, we can reproduce the metric (4.2) for p = q = 1 as follows. parametriz-
ing using euler angles the group element of su (2)  su (2) can be written as

32/2ei 

22/2ei(3+ 

(4.9)

where {i} and {i} obey the algebra of the pauli matrices with [, ] = 0. we take the
coset representative to be

l = ei31/2ei21/2ei

ds2 = d(e5)2 + a((e1)2 + (e2)2) + c((e3)2 + (e4)2) + 2b(e1e3 + e2e4)

(4.15)

note that for b 6= 0 the metric above cannot be einstein.
a = 2, b = 4 component of the ricci tensor rab

indeed one nds for the

r24 = b2(cos21  cos22)csc21csc22

8(a  b)3/2(a + b)3/2

for b = 0 the metric reduces to the standard metric (4.2) with p = q = 1.

(4.16)

for simplicity we will consider the case a = c. it is useful to make a redenition

in this basis (4.15) becomes diagonal

ds2 = d(g5)2 + (a + b)[(g3)2 + (g4)2] + (a  b)[(g1)2 + (g2)2]

we remark that the rst two terms describe a squashed s3. indeed if we dene

we nd

d2

t r(dt dt ) =

(g5)2 + (g3)2 + (g4)2

since t is an su (2) matrix, the metric above is the standard round sphere metric. com-

paring with (4.18) we conclude that the rst two terms are the line element of a (squashed)
s3. moreover the last two terms

should describe a surface which is topologically an s2 bered over the squashed s3.

4.3. the ricci-at cone over t 1,1 as a kahler manifold.

before we come to the description of the deformed conifold let us summarize some
of the results of [11]. in particular we will see how the ricci-at cone over t 1,1 can be
thought of as a singular, non compact calabi-yau threefold.

consider the cone in c4 given by

let us dene a radial coordinate  by

(wa)2 = 0

4xa=1

2 = trw w 

where w := 1[2]

(wii + iw41i2). the base of the cone is described by

detw = 0; 2 = constant

(4.22)

(4.23)

(4.24)

a kahler metric deriving from an su (2)  su (2)-invariant kahler potential k(2) reads
(4.25)

c = |trw dw|2k(2) + tr(dw dw )k(2)

ds2

ricci-atness determines the kahler potential to be proportional to 4/3.

let us parametrize (4.24) as

where li, i = 1, 2 are su (2) matrices. in terms of euler angles

w = z; z = l1.z(0).l2

lj =(cid:18) cos j

sin j

and

z(0) =

2

(1 + i2)

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

substituting to (4.25) (after a redenition of the radial coordinate and by setting  :=
1 + 2) we nd

ds2

c = (d)2 + ds2

x

(4.29)

with ds2
x the t 1,1 metric previously given in (4.2), for the unique choice of constants
1 = 1/9 , 2 = 3 = 1/6 which give a ricci-at metric on the cone. the fact that
the base is t 1,1 can also be seen directly from (4.26) by noting that there is a transitive
su (2)  su (2) action with a u (1) stabilizer embedded symmetrically in the two su (2)
factors

4.4. the deformed conifold: smooth noncompact cy3

in this section we will describe the deformation of the conifold. the apex is replaced by
an s3. insisting on ricci-atness we get a smooth noncompact cy3. the  = constant 6= 
surfaces are still t 1,1 spaces whose geometry is described by the generalized metric (4.15).
we also examine the geometry near the apex.

consider deforming (4.22) to

detw = 2/2

(4.31)

we can again dene a radial coordinate as in (4.23) but now  is bounded below by . we

can parametrize the  = constant surfaces by

w = z; z = l1.z(0)

to the next sections.

where  := 2k(2) and  := (2). the metric on the  = constant slice is of the

generalized form (4.15).

requiring ricci-atness and correct asymptotic behaviour of the metric (4.35) leads

to the following dierential equation

2(4  4)(3) + 343  28 = 0

the general solution reads

 = (c +

(sinh2  2 ))1/3(tanh )1

(4.36)

(4.37)

where c is a constant. in the limit /   the constant c can be dropped and the solution
asymptotes its cone value. for c 6= 0,  diverges at  = . from now on we set c to zero.

4.5. the near-horizon limit   

let us examine in more detail the limit   . we make a change of variables

so that

 =   

0   < 

we nd that the metric (4.35) takes the form:

ds2  r2

[(d)2 + d2

(4.42)

is the radius of the s3 on the apex, d2

3 is the round sphere element dened in (4.20) and

ds2

2 was dened in (4.21) and describes a bre of s2 topology.

13

5. d3 on s3

we will now consider the near-horizon limit in the ten-dimensional sense r  0;   .
the ten-dimensional metric in the absence of d3 is of the form (2.3), and our solution-
generating method applies, only near the s3 at the apex of the deformed conifold. we

therefore want to emphasize that we only have a metric (implicitly) for the geometry near

the horizon. presumably there is a complete solution, corresponding to a d3 whose near-

horizon limit coincides with the one given here but we were not able to obtain it. of course

the remark at the beginning of section 3 applies here as well: as we do not have the charge

distribution explicitly, nothing excludes the possibility that this solution corresponds to a

completely smeared d3.

we dene a ten-dimensional radial coordinate u and an angle  by

r = u cos;  =

u
r

sin

(5.1)

where  was dened in (4.41). taking (4.40) into account, we see that the metric is of the

form (3.1) as advertised

ds2 =  dt2 + r2

(5.2)

where the rst line contains the directions parallel to the d3 and the second line contains
the transverse geometry. as already remarked below (4.21), ds2

2 is the line element of an

s2 bred over an s3. the vielbeineea of the 10d metric in the presence of d3 has to be

compatible with the connection given in (3.8) as already explained. in particular if we

dene

we have

ha :=eea  ea

(5.3)

d()ha + ea  dln(a) + ea  hbbln(a) + eb  hbaln(b) = 0

(5.4)

the geometry in the presence of d3 is given by equations (5.4), (3.16), but we will not be
more explicit here. however the case of the shrinking cycle limit   0 (r  0) of the
near-horizon geometry and the case of the at d3 limit can be analyzed explicitly.

14

5.1. the   0 limit of the near-horizon geometry

as we see from (4.40), in the   0;   0 (r  0) limit the near-horizon geome-
try becomes eectively four-dimensional and is split orthogonally between the directions

parallel to the brane (the time direction) and the transverse directions. equation (3.16)
reduces to the harmonic condition in three spatial dimensions and we recover ads2  s2
as usual.

5.2. the at d3 limit.

we can examine the limit where the d3 is seen as at, i.e. for r   with u xed.
all curvatures vanish in this limit. moreover, for    we are moving away from the
brane and we expect to recover ten dimensional minkowski space as a solution. indeed in
this case we easily see that   constant.

6. m-branes, m pq spaces and t-duality

we conclude with a brief discussion on higher-dimensional conifolds.

indeed one

can also consider conifolds with seven-dimensional bases in m -theory - as has been done

extensively in the eighties in compactications of the eleven-dimensional supergravity [20]

but also very recently. we shall concentrate only on the example that is directly related
to our previous discussion, namely m 10 (and its t-dual m 01). just as t p,q these are

constructed as u (1) bundles [21,22]:

m pq = m pq0 =

s5  s3
u (1)

.

(6.1)

since odd spheres can be thought of as u (1) bundles over projective spaces, the factoring
leads to identication of the two bers in (6.1) and as a result m pq can be thought as a u (1)
bundle over cip2  s2 with the topology depending on the ratio of p and q (homotopically
all these spaces are the same). while in general the isometry group is su (3)su (2)u (1),
we are interested in cases with larger symmetry - so(6)  so(3) for m 10 = s5  s2 and
su (3)  su (2)  su (2), for m 01 = cip2  s3.

a cone over m 10, c(m 10), can be almost everywhere described by a quadric in c6
with two real planes intersecting it. trying to resolve the singularity, we end up replacing
the apex of the cone either by s2 factor of by s5. dierently from the previous case where
only the deformation of c(t 1,1) (nite size s3) was of interest for us here we get a duality

15

between the factors - when putting m -theory on the cone, we can get a three-dimensional
back hole either by wrapping m 2 on s2, or by the dual procedure of wrapping m 5 on s5.

similarly, a two-dimensional black hole can be constructed by wrapping d3 on the
shrinking s3 in c(m 01). a circle compactication of the previous case accompanied with
t -duality should relate this to the m 2 and m 5 discussed above. indeed, as known [23],

t -duality untwists u (1) bundles interchanging the bases of the two cones. all these cases
have no supersymmetry preserved since both m 10 and m 01 admit no killing spinors.

acknowledgments

we would like to thank gregory moore for suggesting to us the problem of d3 on

a conifold as a more tractable example of a brane on a non-trivially embedded cycle, for

suggestions on a preliminary version of this paper and for numerous useful discussions.

helpful discussions with v. moncrief, g. zuckerman are also gratefully acknowledged.
