abstract

we examine the structure of the potential energy of 2+1-dimensional yang-mills
theory on a torus with gauge group su(2). we use a standard denition of distance
on the space of gauge orbits. a curve of extremal potential energy in orbit space
denes connections satisfying a certain partial dierential equation. we argue that the
energy spectrum is gapped because the extremal curves are of nite length. though
classical gluon waves satisfy our dierential equation, they are not extremal curves.
we construct examples of extremal curves and nd how the length of these curves
depends on the dimensions of the torus. the intersections with the gribov horizon
are determined explicitly. the results are discussed in the context of feynmans ideas
about the origin of the mass gap.

1 introduction

to understand how the non-abelian structure of gauge theories can lead to connement
and a dynamical mass gap is a classic problem. in this paper, we examine the geometry
of the gauge-theoretic eld-conguration space in two space and one time dimension
and the potential-energy functional on this space. we examine the region of this
innite-dimensional space where the potential energy is small (i.e. of order one over
the size of the system). a major question is whether this region is of nite extent.
in this paper, we partially answer this question. we discuss how our results support
the hypothesis that the shape of the potential-energy functional and the geometry of
conguration space lead to the presence of a mass gap when the theory is quantized.
early attempts to understand connement and the gap in terms of the properties
of the conguration space (or orbit space) were made by gribov [1], feynman [2] and
singer [3]. gribov and feynman attempted to use gauge transformations to minimize
the pythagorean distance between congurations. feynman, in particular made certain
conjectures concerning the mass spectrum and connement in 2 + 1 dimensions1. the
rst general use of this minimal distance in the literature may have been in reference
[4].

singer dened a metric of riemannian form on orbit space, for the purpose of
studying the spectrum of the laplacian on this space in a gauge-invariant way [3].
singers metric is the innitesimal version of that discussed in references [4] and [2].
further discussion of the metric can be found in [5] and in particular [6]. other
important observations were made by zwanziger, van baal and cutkowsky [7]. a
recent related development is the important work in 2 + 1 dimensions of karabali
and nair who solved gauss law and have demonstrated the existence of connement
and a mass gap at strong coupling with no cut-o [8] and developed strong-coupling
expansions which seem quite reliable [9].

the degrees of freedom of the gauge theory are the set of gauge connections modulo
gauge transformations. these degrees of freedom are called gauge orbits. the geometry
of the space of gauge orbits (called orbit space) is known to be quite complicated
[3, 6, 10, 11, 12]. it was shown in reference [12] that the distance between congurations
is a metric (in the real-analytic sense) and is just the length of a minimal geodesic with
the local metric of singer, as had been conjectured by babelon and viallet [6]. using
the lattice formulation of gauge theory, it was rst shown in reference [13] and later in
reference [14] that the heat kernel of the kinetic term of the hamiltonian is proportional
to the exponential of the square of this metric.

our starting point on this problem is the intuitive picture of the dynamics of
2 + 1-dimensional gauge theory, proposed by feynman [2]. feynman worked in the
schrodinger representation and analyzed the structure of the potential energy func-
tional. we interpret feynmans approach [2] as the study of the dependence of the

earlier by him.

potential energy on a coordinate called the radius. this coordinate is the distance
from the pure gauge orbit. feynman argued that, unlike the case of abelian gauge
theories, all non-abelian orbits with minimal potential energy occur within a region
of nite radius (incidentally, this conjecture is false for yang-mills theories in three
space dimensions [12, 13] and the o(n) nonlinear sigma model in one space dimension
[13, 15]). feynman gave some heuristic arguments to this eect. we construct extrema
of the potential energy on spheres of xed distance from the pure gauge orbit in orbit
space for the su(2) gauge theory. we nd a dierential equation which must be satis-
ed by these extrema. on a case-by-case basis, we determine which of the solutions of
this equation are truly extrema and call these solutions extremal curves [15]. we also
show that our extremal curves are actually minimal curves or river valleys [13, 15]. the
only extremal curves we have succeeded in nding have nite length in orbit space. if
all the extremal curves of the 2 + 1-dimensional su(2) yang-mills theory are of nite
length, then we expect a gap in the energy spectrum directly above the ground state.
while we have not yet constructed all the extremal curves, we have found and

analyzed two interesting subclasses when space is a at torus:

1. flat families of orbits. these are nontrivial zero-curvature orbits.

2. a family of special non-abelian orbits. these are proved to be the only

extremal-curve orbits with constant potential-energy density.

we prove that 1. and 2. have a xed maximum radius and are river valleys.

we also consider some abelian families of orbits. these contain representative
gauge elds in a u(1) subalgebra of the su(2) theory that we consider. these are
standing color waves, i.e. the classical analogues of gluons. we show that these families
of orbits are not extremal curves. this result is important because it strongly indicates
that gluons are not physical excitations. in contrast, the river valleys of an abelian
gauge theory are precisely such standing waves; this is why the physical excitations of
this theory are photons.

there is a subtlety in this analysis which has to do with the fact that gauge con-
nections lie in the adjoint representation of the lie algebra. the true gauge group of
pure yang-mills theory (in the continuum) is su(2)/z2  so(3), rather than su(2).
in fact, we shall have a choice whether to use so(3) or su(2) as the gauge group.
the dierence is important when the space has non-contractable loops and must be
considered when periodic boundary conditions are imposed.

in the next section we briey review the motivation for the metric we use on orbit
space. in section 3 we show how extremal curves are solutions of a nonlinear hyperbolic
or parabolic dierential equation, and discuss how to distinguish between river valleys,
other extremal curves and unphysical solutions. in section 4, some general features of
the 2 + 1-dimensional su(2) gauge theory are summarized. embedded abelian curves,
are discussed in section 5; these turn out to be irrelevant. the simplest river valleys,
non-pure-gauge connections of zero curvature on the torus are investigated in section

2

6. we show that the elements of these river valleys are within a nite distance of the
pure gauge orbit. in section 7, we discuss the solutions of our dierential equation with
constant potential energy density (many of the details are presented in the appendix).
we show in section 8 that these constant-potential-energy solutions are not extremal
curves, except one, which happens to be a river valley (even this is not an extremal
curve unless the volume of space is nite). the points of this river valley are again with
a nite distance of the pure gauge orbit. in section 9, we compare our results with the
arguments made by feynman [2] and briey discuss why solutions of the elliptic case
of our dierential equation are of no physical signicance. we summarize our basic
results and discuss future directions of this research in section 10.

2 the metric on yang-mills orbit space

in this section, the dimension of spacetime is d+1. we denote the space of connections
on a at d-dimensional manifold by a. a connection is a lie-algebra-valued eld
ai(x), i = 1, ...d, which can also be written in terms of a real isovector aa
i (x) as
ai(x) = aa
i (x)ta, where ta, a = 1, . . . n are the generators of the lie group g. the
structure coecients are c abc, dened by [ta, tb] = ic abctc denote the set of local gauge
transformations g(x) by g. we will sometimes write connections leaving the index and
space dependence implicit, e.g. a for ai(x). the connection a changes to ag under a
local gauge transformation:

ag

i (x) = g1(x)ai(x)g(x) + ig1(x)ig(x) .

(2.1)

the covariant derivative is di = i  iai(x).
orbit space o  a/g is a metric space [12], provided that denitions are made
carefully2. the metric is a function of two variables  and  in o containing a repre-
sentative connection a and b respectively. its denition is

[, ]2 = inf

(2.2)

where the sum on the space index i is implicit.

the potential energy is u[]/e2

0, where e0 is the coupling constant and the functional

u[] on an orbit  containing a representative a is

u[] =

2lebesgue measure is used, gauge elds a are l2 functions, the connections ig1g are also l2
for allowed gauge transformations g and gauge equivalence is dened through sequences of gauge
transformations. to prove that gauge equivalence is indeed an equivalence relation and that the
axioms of a metric space and the completeness property are satised takes considerable work. the
proofs are much easier on the lattice [13].

where fij(x) is the curvature, or eld strength, dened in the usual way as

fij(x) = i[di, dj] = iaj(x)  jai(x)  i[ai(x), aj(x)] .

(2.3)

the pure gauge orbit, whose curvature vanishes, will be denoted by 0.

the heat kernel of the kinetic term k, for short time intervals  behaves as [13, 14]

d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
ek(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

this term therefore describes brownian motion in orbit space with the metric .

3 extremal curves in orbit space

we would like to study the region of orbit space o where the potential energy (or
magnetic energy) is small. to do this we will attempt to nd the orbits  in o such
that u[a] is an extremum on the sphere of xed [, 0] = 0. we will then view 0
as a coordinate along which this minimum changes. the result is a hypersurface in o
which we call an extremal curve. if the extremum is a minimum, we call the extremal
curve a river valley [12, 13].

3.1 the yang-mills-proca equation

to nd extremal curves we vary the functional

q[] = u[] + ([, 0]2  2

0) ,

(3.1.1)

where the number  is a lagrange multiplier. once obtained, it can be checked whether
this curve is a river valley.

at rst glance extremizing (3.1.1) appears intractable. the constraint implemented

by the lagrange multiplier contains the radius [, 0], which from (2.2) is

[, 0]2 = inf
gg

1

2 z ddx tr(ag
i )2

(3.1.2)

which, for most connections, is impossible to evaluate (it is this expression that was
rst studied by gribov [1]). however, the situation is not hopeless. any extremum of
q dened in (3.1.1) is also an extremum of the functional q1 of two elds a and g

q1[a, g] = z ddx (cid:20) 1

(3.1.3)

(though the converse is not necessarily true - it only would be true if the value of g(x) at
the extremum were actually the inmum in eqn. (3.1.2) ). extremizing the functional
q1 gives a nonlinear eld equation for a and g. the problem is still dicult, but a

4

substantial simplication over (3.1.1). once an extremum {a, g} of q1 is found, the
orbit  containing the resulting connection a can be then be tested to see if it is an
extremum of q. suppose we have found an extremum  of q1 dened in (3.1.3), with
representative connection a. then there is some g  g such that the radius is given
by

[, 0]2 =

1

2 z ddx tr(ag

i )2 .

(3.1.4)

by virtue of the fact that g minimizes the quantity on the right-hand side of (3.1.4),
the connection ag satises the coulomb gauge condition:

iag

i = 0 .

(3.1.5)

parenthetically we remark that we ultimately seek g  g which is the absolute minimum
of the right-hand side of (3.1.4). but this is a local extremum as well, so that (3.1.5)
is, in fact, satised. the extremal condition for q1 generates the equations (3.1.5) as
well as

 [di, fij] + (aj + ijg g1) = 0 .

(3.1.6)

now redene a by the gauge-transformed connection ag. this is simply a particular
choice of representative connection of . then this choice of a satises

[, 0]2 =

1

2 z ddx tr(ai)2 .

(3.1.7)

we say that the connection a satisfying (3.1.7) lies in the fundamental region [1], [5],
[6], [7]. furthermore the equations (3.1.5) and (3.1.6) become

and

respectively.

iai = 0

 [di, fij] + aj = 0 ,

(3.1.8)

(3.1.9)

a further simplication is possible. clearly from the form of q1[a, g] in (3.1.3),
q1[a, g] = q1[ag, 1] = q2[ag]. therefore, one can simply vary ag instead of a, in this
new functional q2[ag]. we can now relabel ag by a. therefore, all that has to be
done is to nd the extrema of

q2[a] = z ddx (cid:20) 1

4

trf 2

ij +

1
2

 tr a2

i(cid:21)  2

0 .

at the risk of belaboring the obvious, we will show that the gauge connection which
extremizes q2[a] automatically obeys the coulomb gauge condition (3.1.5), which is a

5

necessary condition for r tr(ag)2ddx to be minimized at g = 1. in fact, this condition

follows from the proca-yang-mills equation (3.1.9) by virtue of the jacobi identity.
taking the commutator of dj with both sides of (3.1.9) yields

i[dj, [di, [di, dj]]] = iai .

(3.1.10)

from the jacobi identity this becomes

 i[[di, dj], [dj, di]]  i[di, [[di, dj], dj]] = iai ,

which simplies to

 i[di, [dj, [dj, di]]] = iai .

notice that this is the same as (3.1.10) except the sign of the left-hand side has changed
and (3.1.8) follows. therefore all of the extremal curve congurations have a represen-
tative connection satisfying (3.1.9). we therefore proceed by nding solutions of the
massive yang-mills or proca equations (3.1.9), then analyzing them to see if they
lie on river-valley gauge orbits. we put massive in quotes, for as we shall see in
examples below, the mass squared  is negative, so the equation (3.1.9) is hyperbolic
rather than elliptic (the quotes will be dropped henceforth).

a necessary condition for a family of solutions of the yang-mills-proca equation
to be an extremal curve is that (3.1.7) is true. this means that the faddeev-popov
functional

f.p. = z ddx

1

2 h(iha)2 + c abcaa

i ihbhci ,

(3.1.11)

which is the second variation of the integral under a gauge transformation, is positive.

3.2 potential-energy stability analysis

suppose we wish to know whether a given gauge orbit with a representative connec-
tion in the fundamental region and satisfying the proca equation is a local minimum
of the potential energy.
in other words, we seek information as to whether such a
connection lies on a river valley or not. the question is similar to that asked in
hamilton-jacobi theory, i.e. whether a local extremum of some variational principle
is a local minimum. however, in hamilton-jacobi theory it is sucient to study the
spectrum of linear operators; a luxury which will be denied us.

suppose that there is a solution of the non-abelian proca equation a contained in
a gauge orbit , such that [, 0] = 0. consider a small variation a  a + a = b,
where the connection b is contained in the gauge orbit . we note that it is nontrivial
to prove that [, ] is then of order (a)2 on the sphere of radius 0, i.e. [, 0] = 0
(this is done in reference [12]). we wish to know whether the new potential energy

6

u[] is greater that u[]. if for any variation a, we have that u[] > u[] then 
lies on a river valley.

let us try to formulate the statements in the last paragraph more precisely. if both

 and  lie on the sphere of radius 0 about 0, then

2
0 = inf

2 z ddx tr(ag

i )2 =

1

2 z ddx tr(ai)2 ,(3.2.1)

where in the last step, we have assumed that the connection ai is in the fundamental
region, i.e. is the absolute minimum of 1
i )2 with respect to g. in (3.2.1),
the gauge transformation h minimizing the second integral can be assumed to be of
the form eih , where the lie-algebra valued eld h is innitesimal. let us dene a
new variation of a, which we call for the moment a given by

2 r ddx tr(ag

aj + aj = (aj + aj)h = aj + aj  i[h, aj + aj] + ijh + . . . .

in general, the new gauge connection a + a remains in the fundamental domain
of orbit space (the exceptional situations occur when a is at the boundary of the
fundamental region). it is a particular gauge connection lying within the orbit . in
particular, a + a satises coulomb gauge and half the integral of its trace squared
is equal to 2
0:

jaj = 0 , 2

0 =

2 z ddx tra2

j =

2 z ddx tr(aj + aj)2 .

(3.2.2)

for convenience, we now relabel a by a.

we must impose the constraints (3.2.2) when investigating the variation of the
potential energy u. this is because we wish to see how variations a subject to the
condition that the gauge orbit remains on the sphere of radius 0 change u. if such
extremal variations produce only positive changes in u, then  lies on a river valley.
our problem has been reduced to the study of the functional

(3.2.4)

we have used the fact that a satises the proca equation and then used the second
of equations (3.2.4) to simplify the rst term on the right-hand side of (3.2.3). the
precise formulation of our question is the following: is j[a; a] positive for variations
a satisfying (3.2.4)?

4 su(2) in 2 + 1 dimensions

in the remainder of this paper, we will only consider the case of two space and one
time dimension.

a non-abelian gauge theory with no matter in two space dimensions is simpler
than a theory in three space dimensions. the 2 + 1-dimensional yang-mills theory is
ultraviolet nite and therefore the bare dimensionful coupling constant can be xed to
some nite nonzero value. the metric and the potential energy are not renormalized by
innite constants. we take gauge group g = su(2) and generators ta = a/2, where
1, 2 and 3 denote the three pauli matrices. the structure coecients are therefore
c abc = abc.

we shall nd it necessary to impose an infrared cuto. to illustrate the reason for
this, consider the problem of extremizing (3.1.1) when the space is the innite plane.
consider an arbitrary connection ai(x). under the scale transformation, ai(x) 
ai(x) = sai(sx), where s is a positive real number, the orbit  containing ai(x) is
mapped to an orbit  (for further discussion, see section 10 of reference [12]). under
this transformation of orbits, 0 is unchanged but u() changes by an overall factor
u() = s2u(). therefore, we can transform the potential energy to a value as small
as desired for a given value of 0. for this reason, yang-mills theory on the innite
plane has no non-trivial extremal curves with nite 0. moreover, to lower its potential
energy and preserve its value of 0, a gauge eld tends to spread out to innite size.
in order to cuto this infrared behavior, we will put the system in a box with periodic
boundary conditions, i.e. a torus with coordinates 0  xi < li, for i = 1, 2 and all
functions of x to be doubly-periodic with periods l1 and l2.
we do not consider twisted boundary conditions in this paper [16]. however, we
should like to mention that the case of a twist can easily be incorporated by doubling
one of our torus dimensions l1 or l2. any su(2) yang-mills-proca solution on the
twisted torus of dimensions l1 by l2 is automatically a yang-mills-proca solution on
the periodic torus of dimensions l1 by 2l2.

5 embedded abelian curves

the rst set of solutions to the proca equation (3.1.9) we will consider are those which
lie entirely in an abelian subalgebra, ai(x) = a1
i (x)t1. the most general solutions of
this kind on the torus are simple to nd:

a1

a1

1(x) = q2 (cos q1x1, sin q1x1) m    sin q2x2 ,
2(x) = q1 (sin q1x1, cos q1x1) m   cos q2x2

where qi = 2li
li
real two-by-two matrix.

, li are integers, the case q1 = q2 = 0 is excluded and m is an arbitrary

it is clear that (5.1) is precisely of the form of the river valleys of an abelian gauge
theory. calculating 0 and u is quite easy and reveal a harmonic oscillator potential
for each choice of qi. the excitations are simply those of the oscillators; they are
photons. the oscillator frequency is minimized by taking one of the qi equal to zero
and the other equal to its smallest allowed value, i.e. 2li
. the gap between the ground
li
state and the rst excited state vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. however, for the
su(2) theory, the situation is quite dierent.

for the solution in (5.1), the potential energy is

u =

(q2)2l1l2tr(mmt )

and

in the region where i(a, 1) can be identied with 2

i(a, 1) =

l1l2q2tr(mmt ) .

0, the potential energy behaves as

u = q22

0 ,

(5.2)

which grows quadratically with 0. this is always the case for the gauge group u(1);
it is easy to see that any gauge copy of a under abelian gauge transformations (a 
a + t1) has a larger value of the integral:

i(a, exp(it1))  i(a, 1) .

however, in the su(2) gauge theory, it is necessary to check whether non-abelian gauge
copies of a can have a smaller value of the integral, i.e. whether g(x) exists such that
i(a, g)  i(a, 1). if this is the case, then 2
0 is smaller than i(a, 1) and the potential
energy rises faster with increasing 0 than the quadratic behavior in (5.2).
one approach to this problem is to check whether i[a, g] is a local minimum at
g(x) = 1. indeed, since ai(x) satises the coulomb gauge condition, it is guaranteed
to be an extremum. to determine whether this extremum is a local minimum, we must
examine the spectrum of the quadratic form in the faddeev-popov functional (3.1.11).
indeed, taylor expanding i[a, g] in the lie-algebra valued quantity h = hata where
g = eih yields [1]

i[a, g] = i[a, 1] + f.p. = i[a, 1] +

where m denotes the faddeev-popov operator

we will show that this operator always has a vanishing eigenvalue for the connection
(5.1). this means that this connection lies on the so-called gribov horizon.

among our choices of , there is always one for which this expression is zero, namely
that with r1 = r2 = 0. while the connection (5.1) is a solution of the proca equation,
it lies on the gribov horizon for all m. therefore, these connections do not lie in the
fundamental region and do not constitute an extremal curve.

we have found a striking dierence between the abelian and non-abelian gauge
theory. in the abelian theory, standing-wave connections lie in the orbits of true river
valleys. excitations in these river valleys are photons. in the yang-mills theory, such
connections are not extremal curves. this result strongly suggests that the excitations
are not perturbative gluons.

6 river valleys containing at connections

an obvious strategy to nd minima of the potential is to look for congurations of
zero eld strength. not all such congurations are pure gauge [16]. the idea is to

10

nd solutions of the eld equations f = 0 which are at a particular distance from the
trivial conguration a = 0,

where ag is a static gauge transform of a. the space of gauge orbits containing such

lower bound, namely zero.

consider solutions of the condition f = 0 on the torus. a connection is at when

it is written as

ai(x) = ig1(x)ig(x) ,

(6.1)

where g(x) is a unitary matrix. a gauge transformation

ai(x)  ih1(x) (i  iai(x)) h(x) ,

is equivalent to

these are trivially solutions of the proca equation (3.1.9).

g(x)  g(x)h(x) .

the gauge eld must satisfy the boundary conditions of the torus,

ai(x1 + l1, x2) = ai(x1, x2) ,
ai(x1, x2 + l2) = ai(x1, x2) .

this will occur if g(x) in (6.1) obeys the condition

g(x1 + l1, x2) = u1g(x1, x2) ,
g(x1, x2 + l2) = u2g(x1, x2) ,

where u1 and u2 are constant unitary matrices. the consistency condition

g(x1 + l1, x2 + l2) = u1g(x1, x2 + l2) = u1u2g(x1, x2) ,
g(x1 + l1, x2 + l2) = u2g(x1 + l1, x2) = u2u1g(x1, x2) ,

(6.2)

requires that u1 and u2 commute.

the expression (6.1) is unchanged if we replace g(x) by vg(x) where v is a constant
unitary matrix. under this replacement u1 and u2 are replaced by vu1v1 and vu2v1,
respectively. since u1 and u2 commute, they can be simultaneously diagonalized by a
judicious choice of v. thus, for su(2) they can be taken to have the form

ui = (cid:18) eii

be periodic up to an element of the center of su(2). for example, we can choose h(x)

7 constant-magnitude curvature solutions i

in this section we will nd solutions of the yang-mills-proca equations with the supple-
mentary condition that the eld strength has constant magnitude. what is remarkable
is that it is possible to nd all such solutions. we answer the question of which of
these are extremal curves in the next section.

we will start with the simplest case, where the eld strength is simply constant.
later (in the next section) we shall see that this case is an example of the general
solution. the equations (3.1.9) and (3.1.7) simplify considerably if fij is assumed
to be a constant. it will turn out that these are the only constant-magnitude eld
strength solutions which are extremal curves.

we begin by looking for a solution for which

fij = ijf t3 ,

with f constant. we have two reasons for treating this case rst. the rst is that it is
considerably easier than the more general situation of curvature of constant magnitude.
the second reason is that, as we show in section 8, these congurations are the only

12

constant-magnitude curvature extremal curves, and therefore it seems worthwhile to
derive them simply.

the equation (3.1.9) becomes

i + aa

j = 0 ,

(7.1)

from which a3

j = 0 immediately follows.

dene a to be the real 22 matrix whose b - i component is ab

i. then (7.1) becomes

2 a 2 =


f

a .

(7.2)

there are solutions of (7.2) only if  = f . if  = f , then

while if  = f , then

a = a+  a01 + ia22 ,

a = a  a11 + a33 .

these results may be written in terms of the corresponding connections a i as

a+,1 = a3t1 + a1t2 , a+,2 = a1t1  a3t2 ,
a,1 = a0t1  a2t2 , a,2 = a2t1 + a0t2 .

the curvature must given by

f = 

1
2

tr a2a2 = 

1
2

tr a2


,

and the abelian piece 1a2  2a1 must vanish. this latter condition means that
for  = +, a2
2 is constant.
the coulomb gauge condition (3.1.8) then implies that the numbers a1, a2, a3 and a4
are everywhere harmonic functions, 2aq = 0, q = 1, 2, 3, 4. since these functions are
doubly-periodic, liouvilles theorem implies that they are constants.

2 is constant, while if  = , a  a2

to summarize the results obtained in this section thus far, we have found that the

solutions to the proca equation with constant eld strength are of the form

2)a]2} with respect
to gauge transformations g. each of our constrained proca solutions is a local extremum
of i[a, g] at g = 1. however, further work needs to be done to check to see whether
such a solution is an extremal curve conguration; in other words, that it is the absolute

0. given
i[a, 1] it is possible to determine f and . we nd that for both f =  and f = ,

2i[a, 1]

.

an extensive analysis to determine whether i[a, 1] can be decreased by a gauge trans-
formation will be done in section 9. the gauge orbit of only one of the resulting
solutions (up to translations and rotations) is found to lie on on an extremal curve.

next we turn to the more general case of solutions of (3.1.9) for which the curvature
is not assumed constant, but the magnitude of the curvature is assumed constant. the
key to nding these solutions is the analyticity of certain quadratic polynomials of the
connection. liouvilles theorem then guarantees that these quadratic polynomials are
constants. this enables us to use a particular parametrization of the connections and
the curvature. the constant-curvature solutions of the last section are a special case
of those we nd here.

the equations (3.1.9) may be written as

if a + a b cab

if c = ijaa

ij  i jf a .

we supplement these equations with the condition

(f a)2  f 2 .

where n is an integer. this is a quartic equation for || in terms of the integer n and

14

the eld strength f a in (7.6) can always be made equal to f a3 by a gauge trans-
formation, no matter what the choice of ||. however, the gauge orbit containing the
gauge connection in (7.6) is dierent for each . though the eld strength for two such
gauge elds, each with a dierent  is the same, it is in general impossible to gauge
transform one gauge eld to the other (this will be shown in the next section). this is
an example of the wu-yang ambiguity [18].

we now have all the solutions to the proca equations which have constant potential-
energy density. we note that these include the constant-eld-strength congurations
of (7.3). these are simply (7.6) when || = f , i.e. global gauge rotations of (7.3). we
now need to see under which circumstances these are absolute minima of i[a, g] =
4 r d2x{[(ag

any river-valley gauge orbit of constant potential energy density must contain a gauge
conguration satisfying the constrained proca equations (7.4) and (7.5). we proved
in the appendix that such a connections must always be of the form (7.6).
in this
section we determine which of the orbits containing (7.6) are in river valleys. we begin
this analysis by working in the full plane r2, where it is somewhat easier than on the
torus. in the plane we shall nd that none of the solutions (7.6)are river valleys. this
conclusion is not so surprising, for without a careful restriction on gauge orbits [12] the
sphere of constant 0 is not a compact space. we then show that on the torus only one
of the gauge congurations aa
i given by (7.6) is a local minimum of i[a, g] at g = 1.
however for suciently large f , at the gribov horizon, even this conguration is not
a local minimum. the horizon is reached at a nite value of 0.

8.1 the eects of gauge transformations in the plane

1]2 + [(ag)a

we rst examine (7.6) in the plane r2. we shall nd that for any of these con-
nections there always exists a g(x)  su(2), g(x) 6= 1 such that [(ag)a
2]2 <
1)2. the expression on each side of this inequality is constant, so this is
1)2 + (aa
(aa
similar to saying that i[a, g] < i[a, 1], though in truth, neither integral exists. a
careful denition of gauge orbits excludes gauge elds which are not square-integrable
(clearly (7.6) is not square-integrable in the plane). nonetheless, it is useful to examine
2]2 for (7.6) in r2, as it will shed light on the situation on the torus.
[(ag)a
since this quantity happens to be independent of x in this subsection, it is analogous
to the integral i[a, g] in the general case.
we should like to mention that the f > || connections are gauge equivalent to the
f < || connections, with the space-coordinate axes interchanged. to show this, we
make a rigid (i.e. independent of x) gauge transformation of (7.6) so that a
0  f a1,
a
0  f a2 and f a
0 = 0. we then nd for

0  f a3 and to make a translation so that x1

tion (8.1.2) are interchanged. thus an f > || solution and an f < || solution are
equivalent under a gauge transformation.

variation of the integral of this expression (i.e. i[a, g]) with respect to a small gauge
transformation g  1  ih  h2/2. the result is again the faddeev-popov functional

i ihbhci .

(8.1.3)

even though i[a, g] is not well-dened, the functional f.p. exists for appropriately
dened gauge transformations. this quantity can be negative for some choice of ha.
for by fourier transforming and replacing i by ipi, the eigenvalues of the quadratic

form (8.1.3) are (pi)2, (pi)2  2f 1/2q(pi)2. one of these eigenvalues is negative for any

pi such that (pi)2 < 4f . since the values of pi are continuous, a negative eigenvalue is
always present.

it is actually quite easy to show that the gauge connections (7.6) are dierent for
dierent || < f (we have already showed that each || < f solution is gauge equivalent
to a unique || > f solution). by making the further gauge transformation g(x),

on (8.1.2), the transformed component aa

though these axial-gauge-xed connections are all distinct, there do exist gauge trans-
formations such that each has the same eld strength f a, explicitly illustrating the
wu-yang ambiguity [18].

the secular determinant of the resulting matrix vanishes at the eigenvalues of m.
for each choice of j1 and j2 there are three eigenvalues w(j1, j2; 1), w(j1, j2; 2) and
w(j1, j2; 3) the eigenvalues w(j1, j2; q) are determined by

we will show that if (8.2.1) holds, then there are negative w(j1, j2; q) for some j1, j2

first consider the solutions of (8.2.2) with j2 = 0. these are

w(j1, 0; 1) = (p1 + k)2 , w(j1, 0; 2) = |p1| |p1| +

if n is any positive integer, this inequality must be violated for some j1. therefore

and j2 will eliminate the non-constant connections, even without imposing (8.2.1).

incidentally, it is quite simple to establish the wu-yang ambiguity on the torus,
i.e. to prove that many of the connections (7.6) are not equivalent under gauge trans-
formations, despite their having the same eld strength after gauge transformations.

(8.2.5)

(8.2.6)

these gauge-invariant quantities clearly depend on . this does not prove that all the
congurations (7.6) are gauge-inequivalent, because of the periodicity of the right-hand
sides of (8.2.5) and (8.2.6). however, it is clear that most of the connections (7.6) really
are gauge-inequivalent, because the values of  are quantized according to (7.7).

8.3 a river valley of the gauge theory on the torus

we have shown that the only possible river-valley gauge connections on the torus
with constant (f a)2 are given by with || = f . these have have, of course, constant
gauge connections aa
i . we will show that these are indeed river-valley congurations
for f suciently small.

let us rst check whether i[a, 1] is a minimum of i[a, g] for this conguration. if
this is the case, then the distance of the gauge orbit containing aa
i from the pure-gauge
orbit is given by 0 = i[a, 1]. let us begin by repeating the arguments in subsection
8.1. the second variation of this integral with respect to small gauge transformations
g  1ihh2/2 is again the faddeev-popov functional (3.1.11). however, the integral
is now performed over the torus instead of the plane. as done for (8.1.3), fourier
transforming and replacing i by ipi, in (3.1.11), the eigenvalues of the quadratic form

(8.1.3) are (pi)2, (pi)2  2f 1/2q(pi)2. the new feature is that pi is quantized, and may

only take the values pi = 2ji/li, for some integers j1 and j2. with the exception of
the zero modes of global gauge transformations when p1 = p2 = 0, the eigenvalues are
all positive, if and only if

f < 2min( 1

(8.3.2)

we will argue, using the methods of subsection 3.2, that the family of gauge orbits
(7.6) with || = f is indeed a river valley. let us examine of the functional j[a; a]
dened in (3.2.3). as discussed in subsection 3.2, we wish to determine whether this
functional is positive, subject to the conditions (3.2.4). since the gauge connection a
is translation invariant, we must actually uncover choices of a for which j[a; a]
vanishes. however, under the variations a orthogonal to these translations, the func-
tional j[a; a] is positive within the gribov horizon. this establishes that the family
of gauge orbits parametrized by f is indeed a river valley.

the gauge connections we are considering are of the form aa

j . we can
solve the rst of (3.2.4) by writing the variation of gauge connection as a fourier series

of which only  can possibly be zero or negative. the eigenvalue  is positive
provided (8.3.1) holds.

we have proved that the connections (7.6) with || = f lie within the gribov horizon
and are stable under those variations which do not change i[a, 1]. what remains to to
show is that they lie within the fundamental region. to prove this rigorously we would
have to establish that there is no choice of g, such that i[a, g] < i[a, 1]. though we
have not done this, we have not succeeded in reducing i by a gauge transformation
and have convinced ourselves that this is not possible. consequently, we assert that
these gauge connections lie in gauge orbits , the set of which is a river valley. from
(8.3.2) we conclude that the 2

zero to 2

9 feynmans arguments and vortex solutions

we now attempt to compare the results of this paper to that of feynman [2]. in our
language, feynman argued that a slowly-varying connection a in an orbit  has a value
of 0 which is considerably smaller than i[a, 1]. he thereby concluded that the lowest-
lying excitations were not gluons. this conclusion is strongly supported by our results.
feynman also argued that in reducing i[a, 1] to i[a, g], slowly-varying connections a
would be gauge transformed to connections ag with a periodic structure, of period

 1/f . he went on to argue that the genuine excitations are described by small

oscillating domains of magnetic ux whose size is equal to this period. however, we
nd no evidence of this. we believe the reason feynman came to this conclusion is that
his method of lowering the integral i[a, 1] to i[a, g] was heuristic and did not provide
a lower bound. he carried out this reduction in the thermodynamic limit, starting with
connections of constant eld strength of the form a1 = 0, aa
2 = f a3x1. his gauge-
transformed gauge potential is not included among the general solutions we have found
(in a nite volume, feynmans connection is inequivalent to any we consider) [17, 18].

21

we have found the smallest i[a, g] for congurations of constant eld strength in the
previous two sections and do not see evidence of a periodic structure in ag.

an excitation of the form suggested by feynman would occur if there existed a
river valley whose elements were described by elliptic solutions of (3.1.9), i.e. solutions
with  > 0. in fact there are such elliptic solutions; they are non-abelian vortices [19].
this is seen by introducing a chiral eld g and writing (3.1.9) and (3.1.8) as

[dg

i , f g

ij] + (ag)j = 0 ,

j(ag)j = 0 ,

where ag, is dened by (2.1) as before, dg
ij = g1fijg (we are
reinterpreting our proca equation as the unitary gauge formulation of the gauged chiral
sigma model). however these vortex solutions have logarithmically-divergent potential
energy. this energy can be regularized with a cut-o, but in 2+ 1 dimensions, this eld
theory requires only nite renormalization, as the cut-o is removed. upon removal of
the cut-o, vortices are suppressed.

i = g1dig and f g

10 conclusions

in our studies of the structure of the potential-energy functional on orbit space we have
found signicant dierences between the su(2) and abelian gauge theories. the fact
that standing-wave proca solutions of section 5 lie on the gribov horizon is evidence
that the quantized particle excitations bear no resemblance to perturbative gluons.
the families of gauge orbits of minimal potential energy lie in river valleys of nite
length. if this is true for all such families of orbits, a mass gap must be present.

we are attempting to construct most of the river valleys for the 2 + 1-dimensional
su(2) theory, at least approximately. this may be sucient to nd the vacuum and
the lowest excited states.

we are also studying the extremal-curve problem in 3 + 1 dimensions. there are
nontrivial solutions of the proca equation for the hyperbolic ( > 0), parabolic ( = 0)
and elliptic ( < 0) cases. unlike the case of 2 + 1 dimensions, the elliptic solutions
(which have ultraviolet-divergent potential energy) cannot be dismissed out of hand,
since the coupling constant has an innite renormalization. these elliptic solutions
include vortices [19], as well as other congurations.

appendix: the general solution of the constrained
proca equation

a.1 analyticity and parametrization of connections

by virtue of (7.4) and (7.5) we have that

aa

i f a = 0 .

(a.1.1)

from the expression for f in terms of a we see that

aa

i (1aa

2  2aa

1) = 0 .

let us write these equations in complex coordinates, z = x1 + ix2 and z = x1  ix2,
 = /z = (1  i2)/2,  = / z = (1 + i2)/2. the hermitian gauge connection
becomes non-hermitian in these coordinates: a = (a1  ia2)/2, a = (a1 + ia2)/2.
then

aa( aa  aa) = aa( aa  aa) = 0 .

the coulomb gauge condition is

 aa + aa = 0

equations (a.1.2) and (a.1.3) imply

(aa)2 = ( aa)2 = 0 ,

(a.1.2)

(a.1.3)

(a.1.4)

the meaning of equations (a.1.4) is that (aa)2 is a complex-analytic function. if
doubly-periodic boundary conditions are imposed, this function must be a constant by
liouvilles theorem. however, it is interesting to the general solution on the plane. we
will see that even without doubly-periodic boundary conditions, (aa)2 is a constant.

we can derive the relations (a.1.4) another way. if we view our system as a eu-
clidean eld theory in two dimensions, the two-dimensional energy-momentum tensor
associated with (7.4) has components:

1
2

(f a)2 +

(aa

(aa

since (f a)2 is constant, conservation of energy and momentum, itij = 0 implies
(a.1.4).

23

the analyticity conditions (a.1.4) imply that the yang-mills connection has the

functional form

aa(z, z) = q(z)ga
aa(z, z) = q(z)[cosh (z, z)ga

+(z, z) ,

+(z, z) + i sinh (z, z)ga

(z, z)] ,

where ga

+ is a complex-valued isovector satisfying

(ga

+f a = 0 ,

and ga


is the complex-valued isovector dened by

(a.1.9)

whose determinant equals unity by (a.1.7), is not in so(3) but rather in the ad-
joint representation of sl(2,c) (since f a is real, g cannot be an arbitrary element of
adj[sl(2,c)]). in any case, the vector products in (a.1.6) and (a.1.8) are not inner
products.

the function (z, z) is not arbitrary, but is chosen so that

ga

+(z, z) = cosh (z, z)ga

+(z, z) + i sinh (z, z)ga

such a choice of  can always be made. one may always write ga

(a.1.10)

where the isovectors a, a and f a are real orthogonal and normalized, i.e. (a)2 =
(a)2 = f 2 and a = abcf bc. we will nd this expression (a.1.10) useful when we
write down the explicit form of the gauge connection and the eld strength.

24

a.2 parallel transport

before proceeding further, it is convenient to dene the complex one-forms u, v

and w which describe how the vectors ga

 = u ga
 =  u ga

 + v f a , ga
 + v f a , ga

ga
ga

+ = u ga
+ = u ga

and f a change under translations:

+ + w f a , f a = v ga
+ + w f a , f a =  v ga

+  w ga
 ,
+  w ga
.
(a.2.1)

the form of (a.2.1) is dictated by (7.5), (a.1.6) and (a.1.8). these one-forms dene
a connection in the adjoint representation of sl(2, c), namely

b = dgg1 = 


0
v
u
u
0 w
v w 0




, b = d g g1 = 


u
0

v
0
 u
w
 v  w 0

.




this connection is obviously at from the denition, i.e.

for later convenience, we dene the antisymmetric matrices l1, l2 and l3 by

[  b,   b] = 0 .

(a.2.2)

l1 = 


0
0

0
0
0

0 1 0

,




l2 = 


0 0 1
0
0 0
1 0
0

,




l3 = 


0
1 0
1 0 0
0 0
0

,




so that b = w l1  v l2 + ul3 and b = w l1  v l2 + u l3.
if we know g at one point z0, z0 and we also know the connection b, b everywhere
in the plane, we can determine f a, aa and aa everywhere. this follows from the
formula for parallel transport of the matrix g:

g(z, z) = per z

z0

dz b(z ,z)

z0

per z

dz  b(z0,z )

g(z0, z0)

(a.2.3)

the path of the integration in (a.2.3) can be deformed to any path from z0, z0 to z, z
since b, b is at.

a.3 imposing the equations of motion

simplifying the equations of motion (7.4) with (a.2.1) yields

 v ga

+  w ga


+ abcqgb

+f c = iqga

+ ,

 v ga

+  w ga


+ abc q(cosh gb
= i q(cosh ga

+ + i sinh gb

+ + i sinh ga


)f c
) .

25

from the linear independence of ga

, f a, the equations of motion reduce to

v = iq , w = f q ,

v = i q(f sinh  +  cosh ) ,

w =  q( sinh  + f cosh ) .

(a.3.1)

notice that the equations of motion alone impose no restriction on u or u .

a.4 consistency of f as curvature

we next impose (2.3) and (a.1.1) on (a.1.5). since ga


pendent, (2.3) is equivalent to

and f a are linearly inde-

+( aa   aa + abc abac) ,
0 = ga
( aa   aa + abc abac) ,
0 = ga
f 2 = 2i f a( aa   aa + abc abac) .

using (a.1.1) and (7.5), these equations simplify to

0 = q sinh  (i + u) ,
0 = q u  qu cosh  (i + u) ,
i
2

= q v  q(cosh  v + i sinh  w )  iq qf sinh  .



(a.4.1)
(a.4.2)

(a.4.3)

substituting the equations of motion (a.3.1) into (a.4.1) and (a.4.2) means that

either

 i. sinh  = 0, q u = qu, or
 ii. i + u = 0 and u = 0.

we will see in the next subsection that i. can be eliminated. the third equation (a.4.3)
upon substitution of (a.3.1) becomes

1

2q q

= 2 cosh   f sinh  .

(a.4.4)

notice that this equation implies that  is real.

by substituting the equations of motion into the expression for the curvature as we
have done, the full content of the original constrained proca equations (7.4), (7.5) is
in (a.2.2) and (a.4.4) together with either i. or ii.

26

a.5 flatness and the solution for b and b

we next evaluate the commutator in (a.2.2) for i. and ii.
if we assume i., then there must exist a function c(z, z) such that u(z, z) =

q(z)c(z, z) and u (z, z) = q(z)c(z, z). the atness condition (a.2.2) is

(q c  qc) l3 + 2iq q(f l3 + c l1) = 0 .

this equation implies that c = 0 and 2if = 0, and is therefore not viable.

we see that ii. must be satised. evaluating (a.2.2) yields

  + q q[2f cosh  + (f 2 + 2) sinh ] = 0 ,

(a.5.1)

and is just the lax pair of this equation. dening

 = qf 2 + 2z z

q(z)dz ,  = qf 2 + 2z z

q(z)dz

(a.5.2)

and the new eld

 =  + tanh1

2f
f 2 + 2 ,

reveals that (a.5.1) is the sinh-gordon equation

2(, )

 

+ sinh (, ) = 0 .

(a.5.3)

however, this equation together with condition (a.4.4) actually implies that  is a
constant.

the solution of (a.4.4) can be written in terms of  as

 = tanh1

2f

f 2 + 2  tanh1 2

f  sinh1

1

2q qf 2  42

.

substitution into (a.5.3) yields

q3


 q3
 

= c1[4(f 2  42)q2 q2  1]3/2 + c2[4(f 2  42)q2 q2  1]2 ,

where c1 and c2 are constants depending only on f and . in order to have nonconstant
solutions, the right-hand side of this equation would have to factorize into a function
of q times a function of q. however such a factorization is impossible. therefore q,
q and  are all constants. of course, we would also have found this result by simply
imposing doubly-periodic boundary conditions on the analytic function q(z) and the
antianalytic function q(z) (by liouvilles theorem). it is interesting that q, q and 
are constant even without taking boundary conditions into account.

27

our nal expressions for q, q and  are

from which we see that  must be negative. the connections b and b are

a.6 periodicity of the gauge elds

in order to determine the form of the gauge elds at all points on the plane, us-
ing (a.2.3), we must diagonalize the matrices (a.5.4). these constant matrices are
simultaneously diagonalizable, as they must be in order for (a.2.2) to hold. the diag-
onalization is

b = sbdiags1 , b = s bdiags1 ,

with

using this diagonalization, (a.2.3) may be evaluated:

while the expression (a.6.1) gives a real eld strength f a only if 2  f 2, we can
continue the solution to any  < 0.
the expression (a.6.1) is simple to use to nd the form of the gauge eld and the
eld strength everywhere. if we choose  = 0, so that the spatial dependence is in the
