abstract: d-branes on one-parameter calabi-yau spaces and two-parameter
k3-bered calabi-yau manifolds are analyzed from both the gepner model point
of view and the geometric perspective. we compute part of the spectrum of the
boundary states and comment on the appearance of the d0-brane as well as on non-
supersymmetric large volume congurations becoming supersymmetric at the gepner
point.

1. introduction

d-branes (for review, see eg. [1]) play a pivotal role for string dualities. most work
to date has been on d-branes in at space-time. however, a thorough understanding
of string dualities in four dimensions, requires d-branes wrapped on cycles of the
compactifying manifold. of those, calabi-yau manifolds are of particular interest.
the problem of d-branes wrapped on cycles of compact calabi-yau three folds was
the subject of two very interesting papers [2, 3]. in the rst of these papers the sim-
plest calabi-yau three-fold, the quintic hypersurface in four-dimensional projective
space has been studied in detail. in particluar the question whether the geometric
picture of d-branes wrapping on cycles survives in the stringy regime was addressed.
in the second paper diaconescu and romelsberger have extended relevant aspects of
this analysis to an elliptically bred two-parameter calabi-yau manifold. the same
question has been studied also in [5] and for a non-compact calabi-yau manifold
in [6]. the general picture has been expounded by douglas [24]. even though in
these papers important progress has been made, d-branes on calabi-yau spaces are
far from being understood. the aim of this paper is to apply some aspects of the
analysis of [2, 3] to a few more models. these are the three remaining one-parameter
models and the two two-parameter k3 brations in weighted projective space.

in section 2 we provide some relevant background material about the one-parameter
models and compute the intersection matrix on the three-cycles on the mirror as
a preparation for the comparison with the computations from superconformal eld
theory. this will then be done for the k3 brations in section 3. we then provide
in section 4 the basic tool in relating the spectrum of supersymmetric brane cong-
urations at the large volume limit to the periods of the holomorphic three-form of
the calabi-yau manifold. in particular we compute the number of moduli of branes
wrapped on the k3 ber. in section 5 we discuss the boundary conformal eld theory
for the gepner models associated with the calabi-yau manifolds under considera-
tion. finally in section 6 we put everything together and discuss some interesting
boundary states.

note: the part on the two-parameter k3-brations has considerable overlap with
the recent preprint [32] which appeared while we were in the process of nalizing this
paper. where applicable, our results agree.

2. the 1-parameter models

there are four 1-parameter models of fermat type: first, there is p4
1,1,1,1,1[5] known
as the quintic in p4 which has been extensively studied in [10] and [2]. then there
are the degree 6 hypersurfaces p4
1,1,1,1,2,

1,1,1,1,2[6] in the weighted projective space p4

1

the degree 8 hypersurfaces p4
p4
in [9] and [7]. recall that the weighted projective space p4

1,1,1,1,4 and the degree 10 hypersurfaces
1,1,1,2,5 which were explored from the point of view of mirror symmetry
w1,w2,w3,w4,w5 is dened by

1,1,1,1,4[8] in p4

the hypersurfaces xi are typically given by

x1 can be described as triple cover of p3 branched over a sixtic, while x2 can be de-
scribed as a double cover of p3 branched over an octic [8]. maybe these d escriptions
will be useful for studying vector bundles on these calabi-yau hypersurface by re-
lating them to bundles over p3, however, so far we have not been able to achieve this.

in order to study the stringy geometry, we consider the mirror manifolds cxi given

by the orbifold construction {pi = 0}/gi

p1 = z6
p2 = z8
p3 = z10

1 + z6

(2.7)

the fundamental objects in our analysis are the periods of the holomorphic 3-form b
of cx. we are interested in relating the large volume limit point in the kahler moduli

space to the gepner point, hence we have to relate the periods at these two points
as in [2]. at the gepner point there is an enhanced discrete symmetry which acts
on the fundamental period 0() by j() = ag0() = 0(j), j = 0 . . . k  1,
where k = 1. here k = 6, 8, 10 for these three models [7]. since b3(x) = 4, we see
that the periods j are not linearly independent. by considering j for || < 1 one
obtains the following relations between the j.

j + j+2 + j+4 = 0,

j = 0, 1

j + j+4 = 0,

j = 0, 1, 2, 3

j + j+5 = 0 j = 0, 1, . . . , 4

0 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 0

following [7] we choose as period vectors  = (2, 1, 0, k1)t , k = 6, 8, 10. on
the other hand, the large volume basis will be denoted by  = (6, 4, 2, 0)t .

then we have  = m where m = knm with k as in [2] and m, n as in [7]. the
change of basis for the three models is then, up to an sp(4, z) ambiguity,

we will return these models in section 5.

3. the geometry of the k3 brations

we consider the models p4

1,1,2,2,2 by e.g.

1,1,2,2,2[8] which are given as degree 8 hypersurfaces x in

(z1 : z2 : z3 : z4 : z5)  p4

(3.1)

and the models p4
by e.g.

1,1,2,2,6[12] which are given as degree 12 hypersurfaces x in p4

1,1,2,2,6

1,1,2,2,6

(3.2)

they have been extensively studied in [4] and [12]. qualitative aspects of these mod-
els can and will be discussed together. the distinction between them is only made
where necessary. both have a curve c of a1 singularities at z1 = z2 = 0 which are of
genus three and two, respectively. blowing up these singularities gives an exceptional
divisor e in x which is a ruled surface. the degree one polynomials generate a lin-
ear system |l| which projects x to p1 with the bers being k3 surfaces. the two
divisors l and e generate h4(x, z). the degree two polynomials generate another
linear system |h| which is related to the rst by |h| = |2l + e|. the ber of the
ruled surface e will be denoted by l. the intersection of two general members of
|h| and |l| will be denoted by h. the two classes h and l generate h2(x, z). we
choose the generators of the complexied kahler cone to be (e, l), so that a generic
kahler class is written k = t1e + t2l, where (t1, t2) are classical coordinates on the
kahler moduli space of x.

these classes satisfy the following intersection relations. for p4

1,1,2,2,2[8]

h 3 = 8, h 2  l = 4, h  l2 = 0, l3 = 0,
e3 = 16, e2  l = 4, e  l2 = 0, h  e  l = 4
h = 1
l  l = 1, l  h = 0, h  l = 0, h  h = 1, e  l = 2, e  h = 1
c2(x)  e = 8,

c2(x)  h = 56

h 3 = 4, h 2  l = 2, h  l2 = 0, l3 = 0,
e3 = 8, e2  l = 2, e  l2 = 0, h  e  l = 2
h = 1
l  l = 1, l  h = 0, h  l = 0, h  h = 1, e  l = 2, e  h = 1
c2(x)  e = 4,

c2(x)  h = 52

(3.4)

when we include  corrections to the classical geometry, we do this by considering

the complex structure moduli space of the mirror cx which does not get any such
corrections. the mirror family cx is given by {p = 0}/g where for p4

hence the period vector in the (e, l) basis becomes  = (f 0, f 12f 2, f 2, 1, t1, t2)t .
next, we have to relate this period vector to the one at the gepner point  =
(0, . . . , 5)t by  = m. due to the enhanced symmetry, zk, where k is the
degree of the hypersurface, at this point, the periods j, j = 0 . . . k  1 are not all
linearly independent. they satisfy a set of relations which allow us to restrict them
to h3 = 6 of these periods. these relations are for p4

1,1,2,2,2[8]

j + j+2 + j+4 + j+6 = 0

j = 0, 1

and for p4

1,1,2,2,6[12]

j + j+6 = 0

j = 0, 1, . . . , 5

(3.11)

(3.12)

the basis transformation matrix m from the gepner point to the large volume limit
point can be obtained by analytic continuation as in [4]2.

using the relations (3.11) and (3.12) respectively we can express g as a polynomial
ig in the generator g of the enhanced discrete symmetry groups z8 and z12.

ig = g  3g3 + 3g5  g7

we will return to these expressions in section 5.

4. d-branes and periods

this section follows closely [3] to which we refer for further details. let n =
(n6, n1
ergy charges of the d-brane. then the central charge is

(4.1)

we want to map these charges to the topological invariants of the corresponding
k-theory class  which are given by the chern character ch(). this is done using
the exact form of d-brane chern-simons couplings

q = ch()qtd(x)  h even(x, z)

(4.2)

the central charge is

z(k ) =zx

+ k   q4  q6

(4.3)

where k  = t1h + t2l is the generic kahler class before the change of basis to
(e, l). we apply these general ideas to two cases of d-brane systems. the rst
are those with nonzero d6-brane charge which can be represented by holomorphic
vector bundles (more precisely coherent sheaves [23]) v on x.
in order for the
corresponding d-brane conguration to be supersymmetric v must be stable [30].
from (4.2) we obtain

q =(cid:18)r, c1(v ), ch2(v ) +

r

c2(x), ch3(v ) +

the second case consists of systems of d4-branes on the calabi-yau manifolds
wrapped on holomorphic submanifolds i : d  x where d  h4(x, z) as has
been shown in [15] and [16]. using the riemann-roch-grothendieck theorem, the

this will be used when making the correspondence between supersymmetric d-brane
congurations at the large volume limit and the boundary states in the gepner model
to which we now turn.

5. boundary states in the gepner model

the gepner point is characterized by its enhanced discrete (quantum) symmetry
and hence by the fact that the corresponding superconformal eld theory is exactly
solvable. the corresponding boundary conformal eld theory has been solved for the
rational boundary states in [17] and studied further in [18] and [19]. here we want
to extend the analysis of [2] and [3] to the models described in the previous sections.
in particular, we will compute the symplectic intersection form on the bps charge
lattice in the superconformal eld theory.

the gepner model (k1, k2, k3, k4, k5) is given by the tensor product of r = 5 minimal
models at level kj subject to a projection onto states with odd integer u(1) charges
and addition of twisted sectors in order to keep the theory modular invariant. we
include a k = 0 factor if present. the superconformal primaries of the minimal
models are labelled by 3 integers, (lj, mj, sj) with

0  lj  kj,

|mj  sj|  lj,

sj  {1, 0, 1, 2},

lj + mj + sj = 0 mod 2

(5.1)

9

we also introduce the vectors  = (l1, . . . , lr) for the lj quantum number,  =
(s0; m1, . . . , mr; s1, . . . , sr) for the charges and spin structures. the rational boundary
states are constructed by considering each factor separately and then subjecting
it to cardys consistency condition for modular invariance. they are labelled by
 = (lj, mj, sj) and an automorphism  of the chiral symmetry algebra giving
either a- or b-type boundary conditions. they are

|ii =

1


 x,

b,

 |, ii

(5.2)



the states |ii are cardy states while |, ii are ishibashi states [25]. 
 and
b,
are given in [17] and [2].  is a kronecker delta function enforcing both odd
u(1) integral charge and the condition that all factors of the tensor product have the
same spin structure. for the b-type boundary states it implies that the physically
inequivalent choices for mj can be described by the quantity

m =

k mj
2kj + 4

rxj=1

(5.3)

mj ,sj = kjlj

where k  = lcm{2kj + 4}. hence, we will label the b-type boundary states by
|l1, . . . , lr; m; siib. due to the symmetry of the superconformal primaries of the
minimal models lj
mj +kj+2,sj+2 one can restrict the values of the lj to
0  lj   kj
2 . the delta function  guarantees that the |, ii appear in the
closed string partition function. while not giving any condition for the a-type
boundary states, it requires that mj = bj mod kj + 2 for some bj. we will denote the
set of states which is obtained from a given state | l1, . . . , lr; m; 0 iib by applying
to it the generator of the quantum symmetry as its l-orbit.

the properties of the gepner models corresponding to the calabi-yau spaces in the
preceding sections are summarized in the follwing table:

in order to nd the geometric interpretation of the gepner model boundary states we
consider the intersection form of their charge lattice. in the conformal eld theory
this can be computed by the witten index i = trr(1)f in the open string sector, as
was explained in [21] and [22]. this is a topological invariant and hence is unaected

10

by marginal deformations of the scft. in [2] it has been related to the index of the
dirac operator on v  w , where v and w are the vector bundles on the intersecting
branes. for the a-type boundary states it is given by [2]

where gi, i = 2..5 are the generators of the symmetry group satisfying gki+2
completeness we have included the elliptic bration p4
turns out that the rk(ia) can be related to a geometric quantity

= 1. for
1,1,1,6,9[18] considered in [3]. it

i

rk(ia) = b3(x)

(5.8)

where b3(x) denotes the third betti number of the corresponding calabi-yau family
without the contributions form non-polynomial deformations of the complex struc-
ture [12]. it can be checked that this holds for any fermat hypersurface x irrespective
of h1,1(x). this means that the rank of this intersection matrix counts the number

of independent 4-cycles on the mirror calabi-yau cx except those which are coming

from a non-toric blow-up. for the two k3 brations under consideration the number
of non-toric 4-cycles is given by g = 1  c
[20] with the c being introduced in
2
the previous section. it has been recently shown [31] that these complex structure
deformations can lead to a superpotential in the non-compact space-time.

next we consider the b-type boundary states. recall that these states are described
by the single integer m  zk  and that the gj for dierent j are identied. first, we

11

are looking again at the lj = 0 states. in this case, the intersection matrix ib can
be related to the intersection polynomial ig from the previous sections.

it turns out that in all the examples considered, including the quintic in p4 and
the elliptic bration p4
1,1,1,6,9[18], the relation between the intersection matrix ib
calculated from conformal eld theory and the intersection matrix ig found in (2.17)
and (3.17) by using the mirror map at the large volume limit is the same

ib = (1  g) ig (1  g1)

(5.10)

a convenient way to nd the charges for lj 6= 0 has been found in [3]. one replaces
each factor n mj 1
the linear transformation

by a factor nl,el. starting from n0,0 = (1  g1) one applies to it

lj ,elj

l

(5.11)

tl = tl

t =

gl

2xl= l

2

to obtain nl,el = tln0,0tel

t . the charge of the boundary state qb in the gepner basis
is then given by qbtl1tl2tl3tl4tl5. in order to obtain the charges at the large volume
limit we substitute the matrix al for g, where al is given for the dierent models
under discussion in the appendix b.

before we start looking at the spectrum of b-type boundary states we will mention
how to compute the number of boundary marginal operators. for a single boundary
state l = | lj; m; siib it is the constant term in [3]

1

pb =

2enl1,l1enl2,l2enl3,l3enl4,l4enl5,l5  

(5.12)

where enlj ,lj = |nlj ,lj | and  = 21.  counts the number of lj which are equal to

kj
2 . this is due to the symmetry | lj iib = | kj  lj iib in a lj-orbit which halves
the number of states except for lj = kj
2 . in the expression for , kj = 0 factors are
taken into account.

6. boundary states and d-branes

in this section we put everything together and establish an explicit correspondence
between the d-branes described by rational boundary states in the gepner model and

12

supersymmetric d-brane congurations on the calabi-yau spaces discussed above.

for the 1-parameter models considered here we are faced with the same problem
as for the quintic: there is a general lack of knowledge of vector bundles on these
spaces. hence we can only consider some particular aspects. in [2] it was noticed
that there was no d0 brane in the spectrum of the quintic at the gepner point. even
though this only means that there is no corresponding rational boundary state for
the d0-brane, it was argued later on in [24] that there might be a line of marginal
stability which might prevent its existence at the gepner point at all. however,
this seems not to be generically the case, as has been shown in [3] and as we will
show here. let us discuss some interesting states in our models. in p1,1,1,1,2[6] we
do not nd the d0-brane either, however there is an interesting state in the orbit
of l = | 1, 1, 0, 0, 0iib which is a d2-brane with charge q2 = 3. this state has 8
marginal operators in the gepner model.

for p1,1,1,1,4[8] some interesting boundary states are listed in the following table
(there are many more boundary states which, however, we do not discuss here)

l-orbit

| 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 iib (0, 0, 2, 0)

(6.1)

here we nd the d0-brane in the last line. since the number of vacua is two, we
might think of the boundary state as two dierent d0-branes, each of which would
have 3 moduli. this matches with the expectation that the moduli space of the d0-
brane is the whole calabi-yau manifold. as was argued in [3] this might be a sign
of a coulomb branch in the worldvolume theory in which the gauge group is u(1)2.
in the rst line we also nd the d2-brane wrapping some 2-cycle while there was no
pure d4-brane found. particularly interesting are the states in the second and third
line. they describe d6  d0 and d4  d2 bound states respectively. a d4  d2
system is known to break supersymmetry completely in at space. the d4  d2
potential which is dicult to determine on a curved space is expected to approach
the at space result in the large volume limit. hence this conguration should be-
come non-supersymmetric and repulsive for a suciently big radius which prevents
in particular the formation of a bound state. this gives a further example of a super-
symmetric boundary state at the gepner point decaying into a non-supersymmetric
combination of d-branes at large volume point. this phenomenon was rst observed
in [3].

13

next, we consider some important boundary states for p1,1,1,2,5[10] which are listed
below.

| 2, 0, 0, 1, 0 iib (0, 1, 1, 0)

again we nd the d0-brane in the spectrum of the boundary states. in this model
it appears in two dierent ways: once as a single d0-brane in the rst line with the
expected dimension of the moduli space and once as two dierent d0-branes in the
last line, presicely in the same way as in the case above. furthermore we nd in
addition to the d2-brane wrapping some 2-cycle in the second line also a d4-brane
wrapping some 4-cycle. finally there is a supersymmetric bound state of a d4  d2
system at the gepner point corresponding to a non-supersymmetric conguration at
the large volume point.

for the remainder of this section we turn to the more interesting k3-brations. the
following table gives all the boundary states which describe brane congurations
wrapped on the k3 ber. the criterion is that their charge vector is of the general
form (0, 0, n2
2, 0). the anti-branes whose charge vector has the opposite overall
sign are not given in the table.

the bps condition for the charges is [23] d  0 with r > 0 or r(v ) = 0, c1(v ) > 0
or r = c1 = 0, ch2(v ) < 0. this is satised for all the charges above. note that
all the states in a given orbit lead to the same dimension d which provides a check
on (4.22).

the rst one of these boundary states corresponds to a d4-brane wrapped around
the exceptional divisor which is a ruled surface e.

r(v ) = 0,

c1 = 2e,

c2(v ) = 4l  8h c3(v ) = 36

(6.5)

there are only a few results known about semistable sheaves on ruled surfaces. their
application to our problem is work in progress. the second one corresponds to a d2-
brane wrapped on the 2-cycle h which lies at the intersection of the divisors h and
l.

r(v ) = 0,

c1(v ) = 0,

c2(v ) = 4h,

c3(v ) = 0

(6.6)

the fourth one is the d0-brane which has already appeared as a stable sheaf on the
k3 ber.

r(v ) = 0,

c1(v ) = 0,

c2(v ) = 0,

c3(v ) = 12

(6.7)

as in the case of some of the one-parameter models it describes two dierent d0-
branes, each of them having 3 moduli. next we are going to consider bound states of
d0- and d6-branes. they are described by the boundary states in the third and and
fth row of the table. the rst of these is completely analogous to the one observed
in [3] for the elliptic bration.

r(v ) = 1,

c1(v ) = 0,

c2(v ) = 0,

c3(v ) = 12

(6.8)

the supersymmetric boundary state in the gepner model decays into a non-super-
symmetric conguration of d-branes at the large volume limit. the authors of [3]

which we shortly repeat here. in [27] it has been proposed that mirror symmetry is

bers. mirror symmetry now maps the d6-brane on x to d3-branes wrapping the
base b of the bration while the d0-branes are mapped to d3-branes wrapping the

have given an interesting interpretation from the point of view of the mirror cx
t-duality when x and cx admit special lagrangian brations with t-dual t 3, bt 3
bt 3 ber. the above decay process now tells us that the corresponding homology
class b + bt 3 should not support a special lagrangian cycle in a neighborhood of the
space of cx which is mapped to a neighborhood of the gepner point of x by mirror

large complex structure limit. it should support it instead in a region of the moduli

symmetry. these are the phase transitions of special lagrangian cycles under the

15

deformation of the complex structure of cx which have been studied in [28] and [29].

in our example we nd another possibility when we consider the boundary state in
the last row.

r(v ) = 2,

c1(v ) = 0,

c2(v ) = 0,

c3(v ) = 12

(6.9)

it is also a bound state of a d0- and a d6-brane, but now there are two vacua which
can be interpreted as two bound states of one d6- and one d0-brane with three
moduli each.

in [4] the large complex structure limit point in the moduli space was determined
to be at the intersection of the two divisors d(1,0) ; (agtgbg)1 and d(0,1) ;
(agtg)2. if we take (h, l) as the basis for the kahler cone, i.e. b +ij = t1h +t2l,
then the coordinates ti can be related to the periods j by

this choice diers from the one in [4] and is dictated by, as has been argued in [2], the
fact that the state which becomes massless at the mirror of the conifold point should
correspond to the pure six-brane with large volume charges q = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
following [13] and [14]. finally we give the expression for the matrix m

these can be obtained from the corresponding matrices in [7] and [4] by applying
the linear transformation m in (2.11), (2.12), (2.13), (3.13) and (3.14) respectively
to them.
