abstract

we study open descendants of four dimensional zn  zm orbifolds of the non-
supersymmetric type 0b string theory. an exhaustive analysis shows, that using the
crosscap constraint the only model for which one can project out the tachyon is the z2z2
orbifold. for this case we explicitly construct the open string amplitudes. the gauge group

corresponding to the various inequivalent klein bottle projections turns out to be either

symplectic or unitary.

1. introduction

it is well known, that besides the ve supersymmetric string theories in ten dimen-

sions there are also non-supersymmetric theories [1], of which the type 0b theory has

recently attracted much attention. in the ads/cft correspondence it has been consid-

ered as a gravitational background in order to study the dynamics of non-supersymmetric

gauge theories in four dimensions [2]. on the other hand, it was argued that type 0b

theory corresponds to a certain supersymmetry breaking orbifold of m-theory [3,4,5] and

further duality conjectures in lower dimensions for non-supersymmetric theories have been

discussed in [6].

type 0b theory can be obtained either by changing the gso-projection or by modding
out type iib theory by (1)fs, where fs is the total space-time fermion number. its ten
dimensional eld content consists in a tachyon, a graviton, a dilaton and an antisymmetric

tensor from the ns-ns sector as well as two scalars, two antisymmetric tensors and a four

form from the r-r sector. since the elds in the r-r sector are doubled compared to type

iib theory one expects to have twice the number of d-branes in type 0b theory.

although the tachyon renders this theory unstable, it has been shown in [7], that

using the crosscap constraint [8] non-tachyonic open descendants of type 0b theory can

be constructed along the lines of [9,7,10]. the resulting ten dimensional theory contains

a graviton, a dilaton, a scalar, an antisymmetric tensor and a self-dual four form in the

unoriented closed string sector and a gauge vector in the adjoint of u(32) together with
majorana-weyl fermions in the 496496 representation in the open string sector. recently
this construction has been generalized to lower dimensional supersymmetry preserving zn
orientifolds in [11,12] and in [6] for a non-supersymmetric z2 orbifold. it turns out that
the only zn orientifolds, for which one can remove the tachyon is the z2 in d = 6 and the
z3 in d = 4. typically, in non-tachyonic type 0b descendants one has to relax the dilaton
tadpole, which can be cured by the fischler-susskind mechanism [13].

in this letter we study open descendants of four dimensional zn  zm orbifolds of
type 0b theory.1 an extensive analysis reveals that only for n = m = 2 the tachyon

can be projected out, thereby stabilizing the theory. therefore we focus on the explicit
construction of open descendants for the z2  z2 orbifold. the structure of open string
amplitudes are similar to those of type iib theory [15,16], which contains 9 branes as well
as three dierent sets of 5 branes with gauge group usp(16)4. in section 2 we discuss

1 the construction of zn  zm orientifolds for type iib theory has been done in [14].

compactications on four dimensional zn  zm orbifolds. we explicitly construct the
torus partition function for the z2  z2 orbifold and derive the closed string spectrum. in
section 3 we study all possible inequivalent klein bottle projections, one of which projects

out the tachyon. we give the corresponding open string spectra for these cases.

2. the parent type 0b theory

we consider supersymmetric zn  zm orbifolds in d = 4 of type 0b theory. the
construction of the corresponding partition functions reveals the fact, that generically the

untwisted sector contains a tachyon, which is directly related to the one in ten dimensions.

in addition, there also appear tachyons in the twisted sector except for the case n = m = 2.

for the same reasons as explained in [11,12], tachyons in the twisted sector cannot be

removed by any klein bottle projection, since for a geometric orbifold action these states do

not appear in the klein bottle amplitude. therefore, in the following we restrict ourselves
to the only possible z2  z2 orbifold, in which the crosscap constraint [8] projects out the
tachyon.

the orbifold generators act on the three internal tori t 2  t 2  t 2 as g = (1, 1, 1),
h = (1, 1, 1) and f = g  h = (1, 1, 1). the starting point of the construction is the
type 0b torus partition function compactied down to four dimensions:

t0b = h|o8|2 + |v8|2 + |s8|2 + |c8|2i123 ,

(2.1)

where i with i = 1, 2, 3 denote the lattice sums of the internal tori. decomposing the
ane so(8) characters o8, v8, s8, c8 into products of so(2) characters o2, v2, s2, c2,
the z2  z2 orbifold partition function splits into four parts, which are associated to the
four contributions in (2.1). their structure is similar to the one of the supersymmetric

case studied in [15,16]. thus we write

t = ta + tb + tc + td

where we introduced 16 expressions aij with i, j = o, g, h, f :

aio = io + ig + ih + if ,
aih = io  ig + ih  if ,

aig = io + ig  ih  if ,
aif = io  ig  ih + if ,

and ij are combinations of products of so(2) characters, which are z2  z2 eigenstates
with eigenvalue 1. we dene similar quantities bij, cij and dij , depending on ij , ij
and ij, respectively, which are listed in the appendix. at the origin of the lattice we can
rewrite (2.2) in terms of 64 generalized characters (see appendix):

t (0) =

4

xk=1 xi=o,g,h,f(cid:16)|,ik|2 + |,ik|2 + |,ik|2 + |,ik|2(cid:17) ,

from which one can easily read o the spectrum. expansion of the characters of the

untwisted sector yields:

t (0)
untw  tachyon + |v2|2 + 3 |2 o2|2 + 8 |s2 + c2|2 + massive ,

and therefore the low lying states consist in one tachyon, one graviton, 30 scalars and 8

vectors.

the massless contributions of the g, h and f twisted sector are

tw  16  3 h4 |o2|2 + 2 |s2|2 + 2 |c2|2i
t (0)

from which we can extract 192 scalars and 96 vectors. all together the closed string

spectrum consists in one tachyon, one graviton, 222 scalars and 104 abelian vectors.

3. open descendants

in general the choice of signs in the klein bottle is not unique [7]. one can choose

three inequivalent sets of signs in the direct klein bottle amplitude, which correspond to
projections 1 = , 2 = (1)fsr and 3 = (1)fr, where fsr(fr) is the right-
moving space-time (worldsheet) fermion number. the various cases can be expressed as:

8n[aaoo + bboo + c coo + ddoo](cid:16)p1p2p3 + p1w2w3 + w1p2w3 + w1w2p3(cid:17)

where pi(wi) stands for the lattice sum of the kk momenta (winding modes) and s
and c are dened in the appendix. moreover, we introduced signs a, b, c , d = 1
in the untwisted sector and 
d = 1 in the twisted sector. the natural choice
of signs, which corresponds to the 1 projection, is to associate plus signs to bosons
a, 
d = 1. we will denote
the corresponding klein bottle by k1. the second choice 2, corresponds to all plus
b, 
signs a, b, c , d = 1 and 
d = 1. the most interesting choice 3, has
a, c , 
d = 1 and b, d, 
c = 1, which will project out the closed string tachyon.
the dierent projections give rise to three dierent open string spectra.

b = 1 and minus signs to fermions c ,

the unoriented closed spectrum is obtained from 1

2t + k. in the rst case the low-
lying excitations contain the tachyon, a graviton and 18 scalars from the untwisted sector

and each of the 16 xed points in the g, h and f -twisted sector contributes with 4 additional

scalars. the second klein bottle projection leaves the tachyon, a graviton, 8 vectors and

18 scalars in the untwisted sector and 64 scalars and 32 vectors for each g, h and f twisted

sector. finally, the third klein bottle projects out the closed string tachyon and the

unoriented closed string spectrum comprises one graviton, 4 vectors and 18 scalars from

the untwisted sector as well as 32 scalars and 16 vectors for each g, h and f -twisted sector.
a modular s transformation turns the direct-channel klein bottle k into the trans-
verse channel amplitude k. at the origin of the lattice sum, we nd that the coecients
of the characters are perfect squares, which is required for consistency [8,9]. in the rst

case, we thus get

where vi are the volume factors of the three tori. the amplitudes for k2 and k3 are readily
obtained from k1 by replacing the characters ,ok by ,ok and ,ok, respectively.

the open unoriented sector is constructed from the annulus and mobius amplitudes
a + m. for simplicity, we only write the massless contributions to the amplitudes. the
transverse annulus for all three cases can be summarized as:

a(0) = a a(0)

a + b a(0)

with the signs a, b, c and d as dened above, according to the three models. each
term can be arranged into four characters which are multiplied by independent squared
reection coecients, e.g. for a(0)

a we get:

a(0)

and for a(0)
d the characters have to be replaced by ,ok, ,ok and ,ok and
the sum of chan-paton charges {na, dar} (r = 1, 2, 3) by {nb, dbr}, {nc , dcr} and
{nd, ddr}, respectively. notice, that in the present case only characters of the untwisted
sector are involved in the transverse annulus. this is due to the fact [8,9], that only those
characters are allowed to appear in a, which fuse into the identity together with their
anti-holomorphic partners in the closed string gso.

and for m(0)
3 one has to replace bij by aij and cij and the sum of chan-paton
charges {nb, dbr} by {na, dar} and {nc , dcr}, respectively. all quantities have to be
written in terms of real hatted characters [7,9] and o and v are dened in the appendix.

3 with ,oi and {nc , dcr}.

(3.1)

and similarly for m(0)

5

the tadpole conditions can be extracted from k(0), a(0) and m(0) by setting to zero

the reection coecients of the massless characters. one nds that

model 1 : nb = db1 = db2 = db3 = 64 ,

model 3 : nc = dc1 = dc2 = dc3 = 64 .

(3.2)

for the second model there is no corresponding expression, since the characters which

appear in all three transverse amplitudes are either tachyonic or massive. in addition to

the tadpole conditions (3.2) one has to solve homogeneous tadpole conditions, which arise

from additional massless characters in the transverse annulus. they will be given later on

during the discussion of each model.

the above tadpole condition x the rank of the gauge group and therefore the gauge

group of the second model has no denite rank. switching on a non-trivial quantized ns-

ns antisymmetric tensor of rank r for the internal lattice reduces the rank of the gauge

group by a factor of 2r/2, as it was shown in [17] for toroidal compactication and in

[18] for orbifold compactication. in the present case, three dierent choices are allowed:

r = 2, 4, 6, which will modify the tadpole condition resulting in 32, 16, 8 on the right hand

side of (3.2).

in order for the direct channel mobius amplitude to correctly (anti-)symmetrize the

direct channel annulus, the coecients na, nb, nc, nd and dar, dbr, dcr, ddr have to

be parameterized in terms of chan-paton charges:

na = no + nv  ns  nc
nb = no + nv + ns + nc
nc = no  nv  ns + nc
nd = no  nv + ns  nc

, dar = dor + dvr  dsr  dcr
, dbr = dor + dvr + dsr + dcr
, dcr = dor  dvr  dsr + dcr
, ddr = dor  dvr + dsr  dcr .

(3.3)

inspection of the direct channel mobius amplitude (3.1) requires the gauge group to be

symplectic for the rst model and unitary for the second and third model. in the following,

let us discuss each model separately.

model 1: in this case the remaining tadpole conditions result in

no = nv , ns = nc , dor = dvr , dsr = dcr

6

for r = 1, 2, 3. as in the supersymmetric case, one has to rescale the chan-paton charges
such that ni = 2 ni and dir = 2 dir (i = o, v, s, c), in order to have a consistent particle
interpretation of a(0) + m(0). the direct channel annulus amplitude then reads

where e.g. the notation pi6=j di1dj2 for i, j  {o, v} stands for do1dv2 + dv1do2. the above

annulus amplitude together with (3.1) leads to a symplectic gauge group:

(3.4)

husp(16  ns)  usp(ns)i2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)9 

yr=1husp(16  ds)  usp(ds)i2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)5r

.

if we choose ns = ds = 0 the resulting theory turns out to be purely bosonic with gauge
group usp(16)8 for d9, d9 branes as well as for d5r, d5
r (r = 1, 2, 3) branes and the

3

7

spectrum comprises a tachyon in bi-fundamental representations and massless scalars in

the antisymmetric as well as combinations of bi-fundamental representations of the gauge

group.

the choice ns = ds = 8 is particularly interesting, since we get a vector in the adjoint

of usp(8)16 and the following matter content:

(84i1  84i , 84i+1  84i+2)

in the twisted sector. here the index of the fundamental or antisymmetric representations

stands for the i-th factor of the gauge group.

model 2: the direct annulus for the second model is obtained from (3.4) after the
replacement: ,ik  ,ik and ,ik  ,ik. since the direct channel mobius amplitude
only contains characters ,ok, the gauge elds transform under a unitary gauge group.
therefore one has to parametrize the charges as:

no = 2 n , nv = 2 n , ns = 2 m , nc = 2 m

dor = 2 dr

, dvr = 2 dr

, dsr = 2 er

, dcr = 2 er

(3.5)

since the size of the gauge group is not xed by the tadpole conditions, one could set all

charges to zero and would not have to introduce any branes. however, for generic charges,

one nds that a vector together with six scalars transform in the adjoint of

u(n)9  u(m)9

in the twisted sector. here, ai(fi) denotes the antisymmetric (fundamental) representation
of the i-th factor of the gauge group.

model 3: this model is the most interesting one, because it is non-tachyonic. similarly

to the previous case, the form of the mobius amplitude requires a unitary gauge group.

the direct channel annulus amplitude can again be obtained from (3.4) by exchanging
,ik  ,ik and ,ik  ,ik and parameterizing the charges in (3.3) similarly to
model 2:

no = 2 n , nv = 2 m , nc = 2 n , ns = 2 m

dor = 2 dr

, dvr = 2 er

, dcr = 2 dr

, dsr = 2 er

as usual in type 0b theory, one has to relax the dilaton tadpole condition, which can

be arranged by the fischler-susskind mechanism [13]. we can nally eliminate the open
string tachyon by setting m = m = er = er = 0. the direct channel annulus amplitude
then reads

in the twisted sector.

in four dimensions one has to worry about gauge anomalies. however, the common

feature of all three models is that their spectrum is non-chiral and therefore automatically

free of gauge anomalies.

since type 0b is non-supersymmetric from the very beginning, it would be interesting
to generalize this construction to zn  zm orbifolds that do not preserve any supersym-
metry.

appendix a.

a.1. combinations of so(2) characters

in the untwisted sector the expressions ij, ij , ij and ij with i, j = o, g, h, f are:

oo = o2o2o2o2 + v2v2v2v2 ,

og = o2o2v2v2 + v2v2o2o2 ,

oh = o2v2v2o2 + v2o2o2v2 ,

of = o2v2o2v2 + v2o2v2o2 ,

oo = o2v2v2v2 + v2o2o2o2 ,

og = o2v2o2o2 + v2o2v2v2 ,

oh = o2o2o2v2 + v2v2v2o2 ,

of = o2o2v2o2 + v2v2o2v2 ,

oo = s2s2s2s2 + c2c2c2c2 ,

og = s2s2c2c2 + c2c2s2s2 ,

oh = s2c2c2s2 + c2s2s2c2 ,

of = s2c2s2c2 + c2s2c2s2 ,

oo = s2c2c2c2 + c2s2s2s2 ,

og = s2c2s2s2 + c2s2c2c2 ,

oh = s2s2s2c2 + c2c2c2s2 ,

of = s2s2c2s2 + c2c2s2c2 .

here the rst factor refers to the two transverse space-time directions and the remaining

three to internal coordinates. for the g-twisted sector, we get

go = o2o2c2c2 + v2v2s2s2 ,

gg = o2v2s2c2 + v2o2c2s2 ,

gh = o2v2s2c2 + v2o2c2s2 ,

gf = o2v2c2s2 + v2o2s2c2 ,

go = o2v2s2s2 + v2o2c2c2 ,

gg = o2o2c2s2 + v2v2s2c2 ,

gh = o2o2c2s2 + v2v2s2c2 ,

gf = o2o2s2c2 + v2v2c2s2 ,

go = s2s2o2o2 + c2c2v2v2 ,

gg = s2s2v2v2 + c2c2o2o2 ,

gh = s2c2v2o2 + c2s2o2v2 ,

gf = s2c2o2v2 + c2s2o2v2 ,

go = s2c2v2v2 + c2s2o2o2 ,

gg = s2c2o2o2 + c2s2v2v2 ,

gh = s2s2o2v2 + c2c2v2o2 ,

gf = s2s2v2o2 + c2c2o2v2 ,

and for the h-twisted sector:

ho = o2s2s2o2 + v2c2c2v2 ,

hg = o2s2c2v2 + v2c2s2o2 ,

hh = o2c2c2o2 + v2s2s2v2 ,

hf = o2c2s2v2 + v2s2c2o2 ,

ho = o2c2c2v2 + v2s2s2o2 ,

hg = o2c2s2o2 + v2s2c2v2 ,

hh = o2s2s2v2 + v2c2c2o2 ,

hf = o2s2c2o2 + v2c2s2v2 ,

11

ho = c2o2o2c2 + s2v2v2s2 ,

hg = c2o2v2s2 + s2v2o2c2 ,

hh = s2o2o2s2 + c2v2v2c2 ,

hf = s2o2v2c2 + c2v2o2s2 ,

ho = s2o2o2c2 + c2v2v2s2 ,

hg = s2o2v2s2 + c2v2o2v2 ,

hh = c2o2o2s2 + s2v2v2c2 ,

hf = c2o2v2c2 + s2v2o2s2 ,

finally for the f -twisted sector, we get

f o = o2c2v2s2 + v2s2o2c2 ,

f g = o2c2o2c2 + v2s2v2s2 ,

f h = o2s2o2s2 + v2c2v2c2 ,

f f = o2s2v2c2 + v2c2o2s2 ,

f o = o2s2o2c2 + v2c2v2s2 ,

f g = o2s2v2s2 + v2c2o2c2 ,

f h = o2c2v2c2 + v2s2o2s2 ,

f f = o2c2o2s2 + v2s2v2c2 ,

f o = s2o2c2v2 + c2v2s2o2 ,

f g = s2o2s2o2 + c2v2c2v2 ,

f h = s2v2s2v2 + c2o2c2o2 ,

f f = s2v2c2o2 + c2o2s2v2 ,

f o = s2v2s2o2 + c2o2c2v2 ,

f g = s2v2c2v2 + c2o2s2o2 ,

f h = s2o2c2o2 + c2v2s2v2 ,

f f = s2o2s2v2 + c2v2c2o2 .

a.2. characters

the structure of the 64 characters ,ik, ,ik, ,ik and ,ik is:

,i1 = ioai + igbi + ihci + if di , ,i2 = iobi + igai + ihdi + if ci ,

,i3 = ioci + igdi + ihai + if bi , ,i4 = iodi + igci + ihbi + if ai ,

where ij = ij, ij, ij, ij with i, j = o, g, h, f for the untwisted, the g-twisted, the

h-twisted and the f -twisted sector, respectively. we dened the internal part for the

untwisted sector

ao = ooo + vvv

, bo = ovv + voo ,

co = oov + vvo

, do = ovo + vov ,

for the g-twisted sector

ag = oss + vcc

, bg = occ + vss ,

cg = osc + vcs

, dg = ocs + vsc ,

12

for the h-twisted sector

ah = sso + ccv

, bh = scv + cso ,

ch = ssv + cco

, dh = sco + csv ,

and for the f -twisted sector

af = sos + cvc

, bf = svc + cos ,

cf = soc + cvs

, df = svs + coc ,

and

o + v =

1

, o  v =

34
