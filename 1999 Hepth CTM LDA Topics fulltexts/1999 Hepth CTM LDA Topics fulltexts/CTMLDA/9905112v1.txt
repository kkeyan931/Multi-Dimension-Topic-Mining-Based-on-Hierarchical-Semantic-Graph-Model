abstract

the gs superstring on ads5  s5 has a nonlinearly realized, spontaneously
broken su (2, 2|4) symmetry. here we introduce a two-dimensional model in
which the unbroken su (2, 2|4) symmetry is linearly realized. the basic vari-
ables are supertwistors, which transform in the fundamental representation of
this supergroup.

the quantization of this supertwistor model leads to the complete oscillator
construction of the unitary irreducible representations of the centrally extended
su (2, 2|4). they include the states of d = 4 sym theory, massless and kk
states of ads5 supergravity, and the descendants on ads5 of the standard mas-
sive string states, which form intermediate and long massive supermultiplets.
we present examples of long massive supermultiplets and discuss possible states
of solitonic and (p, q) strings.

1 introduction

supertwistors have not yet been fully incorporated into the study of the ads/cft
correspondence [1]. just as penrose twistors [2] carry the fundamental representation
of the conformal group, ferbers supertwistors [3] carry the fundamental representa-
tion of superconformal symmetry. in this paper we shall restrict ourselves to n = 4
superconformal symmetry in d = 4, which has the superalgebra su(2, 2|4). this is
also the n = 8 ads algebra in d = 5. supertwistor variables, upon which su(2, 2|4)
is realized linearly, may also give a natural framework in which to study extended
objects on spaces with this symmetry.1

in this note, we will present a 1+1-dimensional supertwistor model. the super-
twistor variables will take the role of quarks for su(2, 2|4), generating copies of
the fundamental representation in the fock space of states. using these, we derive
dynamically the complete set of positive (conformal) energy unitary irreducible rep-
resentations (uirs) of su(2, 2|4) given in [5, 6] from the general theory of oscillator
construction of the representations of noncompact groups [7] and supergroups [8].
this set includes

doubleton supermultiplets that have spin range between 2 and 4. the cptself-
conjugate doubleton supermultiplet is the n = 4 yang-mills multiplet in d = 4
and corresponds to gauge degrees of freedom that couple only on the boundary
of ads5.

kk supergravity multiplets including both the n = 8 graviton supermultiplet on
ads5 and the massive kaluza-klein modes coming from s5 compactication of
type iib supergravity. they all have spin range 2.

general massless supermultiplets on ads5

2 with spin range between 2 and 4, and

novel short supermultiplets which have a non-vanishing value of the central charge
z in the centrally extended su(2, 2|4) and are conjectured to be part of the
(p, q)-string spectrum. they have spin range 2.

in addition to the above supermultiplets with maximum spin range 4, already de-
scribed in [5, 6], we will focus here on the massive supermultiplets of su(2, 2|4)
which originate from

massive string states with maximum spin range 8.

1for instance, [4] recently studied the superparticle in conformal superspace with additional
tensor charges using these variables. this paper also contains a list of important references to
twistors and supertwistors in addition to those used in the present context.

2 following [5, 6] we dene massless supermultiplets to be those obtained by taking p = 2.

1

the existence of this construction follows from the fact that the model has two in-
dependent supertwistors (corresponding to left-moving and right-moving excitations)
and that independent oscillators exist at each point along the string. the latter
condition in particular allows a fock space state to be built out of arbitrarily many
copies of the fundamental (generations in the language of [8, 5, 6]; we will use this
notation as well). without this (as in the case of the particle) the spectrum would
consist only of the gauge degrees of freedom.

the supertwistor action which we will present here is motivated by that of the
gs superstring on ads5  s5 [9, 10]. this theory has a non-linearly realized, spon-
taneously broken su(2, 2|4) symmetry which is inherited from the superisometries of
the background space. these superisometries realize the algebra su(2, 2|4) nonlin-
early on ten bosonic coordinates (four x along the boundary of the ads space and six
y perpendicular to it, or equivalently ve ads directions and ve spherical angles)
and sixteen fermionic coordinates .

the action of our model, on the other hand, will have a linearly realized su(2, 2|4)
symmetry which is not spontaneously broken. the bosonic part of this action was
extracted from that of the ads5  s5 superstring by restricting it to excitations only
of x (in eect taking    and ignoring the spherical angles). the details of this
procedure will be given in a separate paper [11], in which various ways to realize
su(2, 2|4) symmetry as isometries of supercoset spaces will be studied.

in this paper we take the point of view that a two-dimensional action with the
simplest linear realization of the su(2, 2|4) symmetry can be interesting without
necessarily being derived from any other theory. we will focus here on the fact that
one can easily quantize this action, as there are no gauge symmetries but only a global
su(2, 2|4).

2 overview of the superoscillator construction of

the uirs of su (2, 2|4)

the general superoscillator construction of non-compact supergroups was presented
in [8]. the spectrum of type iib supergravity over the 5-sphere was rst calculated
in [5] and tted into an innite tower of short supermultiplets of su(2, 2|4). more
recently, all doubleton and massless supermultiplets of su(2, 2|4) were given in [6].

the physically interesting supermultiplets are the uirs which admit a lowest
weight state. for these representations the spectrum of the conformal hamiltonian
(the ads energy) is bounded from below.

the centrally extended version of the su(2, 2|4) superalgebra (which was denoted
u(2, 2|4) in [5]) has even subgroup su(2, 2)  su(4)  uz(1). the representation
space is constructed using the three graded decomposition of su(2, 2|4) with respect

to construct a basis for a lowest weight uir of su(2, 2|4), one starts from a set of
states |i, referred to as the lowest weight vector (lwv) of the corresponding uir.
these states are dened in the fock space of oscillators and transform irreducibly
under the maximal compact subsupergroup su(2|2)l  su(2|2)r  u(1). they are
dened to be annihilated by the l operators

k=1 a(k)m (k).

l|i = 0.

(2.7)

by acting on |i repeatedly with l+, one generates an innite set of states that form
a uir of su(2, 2|4)

the central charge-like u(1)z generator z which commutes with all generators of the
superalgebra p su(2, 2|4), whose even subgroup is just su(2, 2)  su(4), is given by

z =

1

{na + n  nb  n}.

(2.9)

here na  ~ai  ~ai, nb  ~br  ~br are the bosonic number operators, n = ~  ~ and
n = ~x  ~x are the fermionic number operators. the basis of su(2, 2) given above
corresponds to the compact basis (with respect to the maximal compact subgroup
su(2)l  su(2)r  u(1)). as was shown explicitly in the second reference of [6],
one can go to the noncompact sl(2, c)  d (lorentz group times dilatations) basis
and write the generators of su(2, 2) as bilinears of four component bosonic spinors
transforming covariantly under the conformal group.
it was pointed out by these
authors that the oscillator realization can be reinterpreted in twistor language (section
2).

3 twistors as quarks of the conformal group

su(2, 2) is the covering group of the conformal group so(4, 2). a twistor [2] is a
set of two commuting, two-component spinors which linearly realize the conformal
symmetries in 3 + 1 dimensions

z  =   

  ! ;

,  = 1, 2 .

(3.10)

under su(2, 2), z transforms in the fundamental as

z (cid:18) l  i

p

2d

k
l + i

2d(cid:19) z ,

(3.11)

where l and l denote the two sl(2, c) lorentz transformations, d is the dilata-
tion, k is the special conformal transformation, and p is the translation. these
transformations preserve the metric

h = 

1

1

!

and so we can introduce a conjugate representation

z = z h = (,  ) ,

such that the bilinear form

z(1)z(2) = (1)(2) +  (1) (2)

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

is manifestly su(2, 2)invariant.

the basic idea of [2] is that twistors are fundamental variables which dene the

space-time coordinates x  via the relation3

3as usual, we replace four-vector indices with paired spinor indices by x  = x  
 .

  = ix  .

(3.15)

4

one easily veries [3] that the standard conformal transformations of x  follow from
(3.11). this suggests that twistors and supertwistors might be useful variables in the
treatment of conformal theories.

it is well known that the action for a massless particle in 3+1 dimensions can
 = 0, we can write

be rewritten entirely in terms of twistor variables. since p 2
(p )  = 

 , and then using (3.15) one nds

or in components

s = iz d z z ,

s = iz d (cid:16)    +  (cid:17) .

(3.16)

(3.17)

this action is manifestly su(2, 2)-invariant. since (3.16) is quadratic it can be quan-
tized in the usual way by imposing [q, p] = i:

hz , z i = 

.

(3.18)

in the language of [5, 6] this gives one generation (p = 1) of oscillators which can be
used to construct the doubleton representations of su(2, 2).

we would like to relate this to string theory. for this we consider the bosonic
sector of string theory on ads5  s5 [10], and truncate out the degrees of freedom
associated with the transverse coordinates in the limit   , (i.e. y = 0). in the
conformal gauge with light-cone world-sheet coordinates  =   , the action in
the rst-order formalism becomes

s =z d2 

1

2 (p+) (p)  + (p+) x  + (p) +x  + . . .! ,

with

p 
 = 2x  .

(3.19)

(3.20)

in the boundary limit the constraint equations become (p+) (p+)  = (p) (p)  =
0 and can be resolved by setting

l 
(p+)  = l
(p)  = rr  .

(3.21)

using eq. (3.15) for the left-movers and for the right-movers we can rewrite the action
as

s = z d2 i(cid:16) zlzl + zr+zr(cid:17) 

1

2 p+p + ...! ,

(3.22)

where zl/(r) = (+/(), +/()) as in (3.11), and +/() is related to +/() as in
(3.15).

5

now we see that in the limit to the boundary we have only the kinetic term for
twistors. this free action is manifestly su(2, 2) invariant. therefore, the theory,
being a subset of the full string theory at the boundary of the ads space, can be
quantized by imposing

hz 
 (,  ), z 

 (,  )i =  = 

(  ) .

(3.23)

the modes of the twistors z are nothing but the innite set of oscillators used in
[8, 5, 6] to construct representations of su(2, 2). therefore, we have found states in
string theory on ads5 which form representations of su(2, 2).

4 supersymmetric model

supertwistors [3] realize the full su(2, 2|4) algebra linearly. they contain two anti-
commuting 2-component spinors (, ) in addition to the commuting spinors (, ).
the supergroup action on the fundamental representation of su(2, 2|4) is of the form:

(r-symmetry)

q,s







here again one considers supertwistors4 as fundamental, and the (x, )-superspace

as a derived concept. the supertwistor z and the metric now naturally extend to

,





 
i
r

h =


z =

  = i(cid:18)x  +

we replace (3.15) by

,

z = z h .

(4.24)

(

(4.25)

and similarly dene  by

i = i ,

i = 1, 2;

r = r

r = 1, 2,

(4.26)

4detailed notation for supertwistors will be given in [11].

so that the bilinear form z(1)z(2) is manifestly invariant under su(2, 2|4). an
additional constraint comes from the reality of x, which implies that the su(2, 2|4)-
invariant norm of z vanishes.

the two-dimensional supertwistor model we would like to consider is

s = iz d2(cid:16) zlzl + zr+zr(cid:17) .

(4.27)

this world-sheet action is manifestly su(2, 2|4)-invariant. the canonical quantization
condition is

(  ) .

(4.28)

hz 
 (,  ), z 

 (,  )o =  = 

on-shell for left- and right-movers we may use an expansion

zl =

n=

xn=

ein( +)zln ,

zr =

n=

xn=

ein( )zrn .

(4.29)

the quantization condition for the left and right movers takes the form

hz 
lm, z 

lno = 

and the hamiltonian reads

mn ,

hz 
rm, z 

rno = 

mn ,

(4.30)

h = iz d(cid:16) zlz 

l  zrz 

r(cid:17) =



xn=

n( zlnzln + zrnzrn) .

(4.31)

thus we nd that the world-sheet supertwistor theory (4.27) has all superoscil-
lators which are required to construct the positive-energy unitary supermultiplets of
the su(2, 2|4) superalgebra in a fock space5. also, the supertwistor action and the
superoscillator construction lead to the short massless and massive supermultiplets [6]
as well as to long and intermediate supermultiplets related to massive string states.

5 physical states of the supertwistor model

to understand the connection between the two-dimensional supertwistor action and
the oscillator construction of [6] it is useful to split the supertwistor into components.
the lagrangian (4.27) is

l = i(cid:16)ll + ll  ll  ll

+r+r + r+r  r+r  r+r(cid:17) .

(5.32)

(5.33)

5we should note that noncompact groups admit also non-lowest weight type representations that

can not in general be realized over a fock space.

7

the quantization condition in components for all left-movers zlm, zln is

[m, 

n] = 

 mn ,

[


m,  n] = 


mn ,

{i

m, jn} = i

jmn ,

{r

m, sn} = r

smn

(5.34)

(5.35)

and analogous expressions can be given for all right-movers zrm, zrn. to connect this
construction to the superoscillators of su(2, 2|2 + 2) we identify the set of pairs of su-
peroscillators (a, a, m , m ) for each generation with our supertwistors as suggested
by the model (4.27):

a =(cid:18) ai
m = (cid:18) br

i (cid:19) ,
a(cid:19)  (cid:18) 
s ! ,
x(cid:19)     

a = (cid:18) ai
m = (cid:18) br

a(cid:19)  (cid:18) 
i (cid:19) ,
x(cid:19)  (cid:18)  
r (cid:19) .

(5.36)

(5.37)

our model therefore has the complete spectrum of states obtainable by the oscil-
lator method [5, 6]. all supermultiplets described in [5, 6] are characterized by the
value of z, which is an eigenvalue of the u(1)z generator commuting with all other
generators of su(2, 2|4). the states with z = 0 form representations of the simple
superalgebra p su(2, 2|4) .

for z = 0 the following supermultiplets of states follow from the quantized action

(4.27):

1. p = 1 doubleton. by choosing one pair of superoscillators, or one supertwistor,
one can construct the ultra-short doubleton supermultiplets. the cpt-self-
conjugate doubleton of su(2, 2|4) corresponds to the n = 4 supersymmetric
yang-mills supermultiplet in d = 4.
it is the unique irreducible doubleton
it is known to decouple from the kaluza-klein
supermultiplet with z = 0.
spectrum [5, 13]. it corresponds to a gauge supermultiplet which couples only
at the boundary of the ads space.

2. p = 2 massless ads supermultiplets. these include the n = 8 graviton
supermultiplet on ads5, which appears in the tensor product of the two cpt-
self-conjugate doubletons. the full description of generic supermultiplets built
out of two generations of superoscillators is given in [5, 6]. the general massless
supermultiplets with z = 0 are those given in table 12 of the rst reference of [6]
for which jl = jr. they have spin range between 2 and 4. the ten-dimensional
interpretation of the intermediate and long massless supermultiplets is an inter-
esting open problem. we see that we need two supertwistors for this purpose.
obviously the (-independent) zero modes of the left and right-moving twistors
give a natural choice of oscillators for p = 2 supermultiplets.

8

3. all p > 2 short massive supermultiplets of spin range two, which form an in-
nite tower of states with a massless graviton supermultiplet of n = 8 ads5
(p = 2) sitting at the bottom. these states are the irreducible cptself-
conjugate short supermultiplets of iib supergravity compactied on s5 [5]
(massive kaluza-klein modes). the lowest weight vector of these supermulti-
plets is the vacuum state annihilated by all the super-oscillators (p generations).

4. all p > 2 intermediate massive supermultiplets of spin range less than 8 and
long massive supermultiplets of spin range 8 with z = 0. the supertableaux of
lowest weight vectors of supermultiplets with z = 0 have equal number of boxes
with respect to both su(2|2)l and su(2|2)r. the long massive supermultiplets
appear for p  4.

for z 6= 0 the following supermultiplets of states follow from the quantized action

(4.27):

1. the cpt non-self-conjugate doubleton supermultiplets of [6] with z = j.
they are constructed from one generation of the supertwistors (p = 1). these
are massless representations of the n = 4 poincare superalgebra in d = 4.

2. the intermediate and long massless supermultiplet for p = 2 and z 6= 0 clas-

sied in [6].

3. the novel short supermultiplets with p  2 and z 6= 0, which are not cptself-
conjugate. they are conjectured in [6] to include 1/4 bps states of yang-mills
theory discovered in [14] and may also belong to the spectrum of (p, q) iib
strings. these multiplets also naturally come from quantized supertwistors of
our model and here again we have an innite number of such states with p  2
due to the innite number of modes of the 2-dimensional theory.

4. intermediate and long massless supermultiplets with p = 2 that are not cpt

self-conjugate, described in [6].

5. intermediate and long massive supermultiplets with z 6= 0.

6 the descendants of the massive string states

a subset of the supermultiplets discussed above come directly from the ten-dimensional
supergravity compactied on ads5s5. these are all massless in the ten-dimensional
sense and therefore belong to supermultiplets with spin range 2 and z = 0. the cpt
self-conjugate doubleton supermultiplet, which has spin range 1, decouples from the
spectrum as gauge modes in the bulk.

9

one would also like to identify the towers of massive supermultiplets on ads5 s5
that come from the massive string states. in d = 10, these states are not described
by classical supergravity and it is this tower of massive states which makes all the
dierence between eld theory and string theory in d = 10.

obviously, since the supertwistors are the fundamentals of the su(2, 2|4) one
should be able to nd such massive states from our quantized action, or equivalently
in the framework of the superoscillator construction [5, 6]. the massive string states
are generically expected to belong to long multiplets with spin range 8, though some
of them may belong to intermediate massive multiplets.
in fact, such massive su-
permultiplets can easily be identied. now the regular massive states of the iib
superstring over ads5  s5 are expected to fall into massive supermultiplets with
z = 0 and those of (p, q) strings will in general have z 6= 0. a typical example
of a long massive supermultiplet is provided by choosing a lowest weight vector of
su(2, 2|4) whose supertableau with respect to su(2|2)l  su(2|2)r is of the form:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

p  4;

jl, jr  2,

n, m  2.

(6.39)

the lowest weight vector above leads to a supermultiplet of elds whose su(2)l 

su(2)r quantum numbers range between

(jl  2, jr  2)



(jl + 2, jr + 2)

(6.40)

which corresponds to a spin range of 8 and has z = n  m + jl  jr. by choosing
jl = jr +(mn) we get long massive supermultiplets with z = 0 of corresponding to
the massive string states of the regular iib superstring. interestingly, both the lowest
spin state and the highest spin state have the same ads energy e = m+n+jl+jr+p .
a detailed study and classication of intermediate and long massive supermultiplets
of su(2, 2|4) will be given elsewhere [15].

the supermultiplets of spin range 8 can be constructed starting with 4 genera-
tions of supertwistors. this is precisely what one would have expected: neither a
superparticle action with p = 1 nor the zero modes of the 2-dimensional action (both
left and right movers with p = 2) would give us massive string states. to have p  4
we really need the -dependence in the supertwistor, as in the usual string action in
the at superspace.

7 discussion

in conclusion, our world-sheet supertwistor action may be viewed as a quadratic
quark-type action for su(2, 2|4) supergroup. the analogy here is that from the
fundamental representations (quarks, anti-quarks) of su(3) one can obtain all the
other representations (mesons, baryons, etc.) by a simple tensoring procedure. here
we have two innite towers of generations of fundamentals of su(2, 2|4), which provide
a complete set of states of the theory which can be described in a fock space.

one should point out that the supertwistor action (4.27) is not derived from the
gs string theory on ads5. the relation between these two theories is more subtle,
as it is the case of linear and non-linear sigma models in general.

the simple supertwistor action, as we have seen, is capable of explaining the spec-
trum of all positive energy uirs of su(2, 2|4). some of these representations can
be identied with yang-mills theory, some are states of supergravity including kk
modes, and some novel representations do not seem to have a clear identication in
any dynamical theory studied so far. if indeed they correspond to the (p, q) states
of iib superstring theory, as conjectured in [6], they may not be captured by the
gs superstring action on ads5  s5. rather one may try to study the sl(2, z)
invariant string theory [16]. the action of townsend and cederwall is also known in
an arbitrary background of iib supergravity. therefore we may apply the supercoset
methods and gauge-x -symmetry in this string action. the states of this theory
will be su(2, 2|4)-symmetric since this will be a symmetry of the background. but
the sl(2, z) symmetry of this string theory suggests the presence of (p,q) states. it
is possible therefore that we may nd some interesting relation of this sl(2, z) sym-
metric string theory to the supertwistor world-sheet model presented in this paper.

finally, we have shown here that the long supermultiplets of the su(2, 2|4) asso-
ciated with the massive string supermultiplets are also present in the spectrum of the
supertwistor model. more detailed studies of such supermultiplets and their relation
to ten-dimensional massive string states will be important.

thus, the fact that the supertwistor world-sheet action (4.27) codies all informa-
tion on positive energy uirs of su(2, 2|4) which can be obtained by the superoscil-
lator method of [6] suggests that this may be an interesting direction to develop. one
is even tempted to conclude that (super) twistors on the two-dimensional world-sheet
may be fundamental whereas the (super) space-time is a derivable concept.
