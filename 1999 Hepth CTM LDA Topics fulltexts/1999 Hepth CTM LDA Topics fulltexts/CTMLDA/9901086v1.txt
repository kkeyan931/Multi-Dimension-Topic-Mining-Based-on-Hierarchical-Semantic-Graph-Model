abstract

the casimir surface force density f on a dielectric dilute spherical
ball of radius a, surrounded by a vacuum, is calculated at zero tem-
perature. we treat (n  1) (n being the refractive index) as a small
parameter. the dispersive properties of the material are taken into
account by adopting a simple dispersion relation, involving a sharp
high frequency cuto at  = 0. for a nondispersive medium there
appears (after regularization) a nite, physical, force f nondisp which is
repulsive. by means of a uniform asymptotic expansion of the riccati-
bessel functions we calculate f nondisp up to the fourth order in 1/.
for a dispersive medium the main part of the force f disp is also re-
pulsive. the dominant term in f disp is proportional to (n  1)23
0/a ,
and will under usual physical conditions outweigh f nondisp by several
orders of magnitude.

1 introduction

consider a compact dielectric nonmagnetic ball of radius a, surrounded by a
vacuum. the permittivity of the material is  = n2 , n being the refractive
index. the purpose of the present work is to calculate the ordinary casimir
surface density f on the sphere (i.e. with the exception of the electrostrictive
force), at zero temperature, making use of the same calculational technique
as in an earlier work [1].. for mathematically simplifying reasons we will
be concerned only with the case of dilute media, meaning that n  1  1.
as in [1], we will make use of the uniform asymptotic expansion (also called
the debye expansion) for the modied bessel functions [2]. here 1/ is
the expansion parameter, with  = l + 1/2 , l = 1, 2, 3, ...... in the main
body of this paper we will expand the formalism to second order in (n  1),
and to fourth order in 1/ .
in appendix a we carry out the expansion
in (n  1) three orders further, to the fth order, at the price, however,
of retaining the debye expansion to second order in 1/ . this treatment
improves considerably on the theory given in [1]. we use the mathematical
package maple v release 4 power edition.
it turns out to be necessary
to keep relatively high accuracy in this problem, since subsequent terms in
the uniform asymptotic expansion alternate in sign. thus, if one simply
truncates the series after a few terms, without observing this alternating
eect, one risks getting even the sign in the nal force wrong.

the ultimate goal in a calculation of this type is to get a casimir force
expression that is directly comparable to experiment; if not a real experiment,
at least a gedanken experiment. to achieve this goal, one must observe
that there are several contributions to the surface force. let us try to put
the things into perspective, by writing down the general expression for the
electromagnetic volume force density f in a charge - free nonmagnetic medium
(cf., for instance, the book [3] or the review [4])

here  is the mass density of the uid.
consider the rst term in (1). we may call it the abraham - minkowski
force. it is equal to zero in the interior homogeneous region of the medium
and acts in the boundary region around r = a only. from thermodynamic
perturbation theory we know in general that  > 1 for a dielectric at zero
frequency [3], sect.14, and we expect the same to be true for moderate and
high frequencies also, except possibly from special frequency bands. that is,
since the sphere is surrounded by a vacuum, we would expect the rst term
in (1) to give a repulsive surface force. this turns out to be true also, in

2

classical theory. in quantum theory, however, we cannot be sure in advance
about the direction of the force; the result depends on the magnitude of the
contact term being subtracted o in the regularization procedure. one has
to carry out the calculation in detail in order to determine even the sign.

the abraham - minkowski force can in turn be divided into two parts:
(1) a nondispersive part. it corresponds to letting the ultraviolet (nondi-
mensional) cuto frequency x0 go to innity. the early works on the casimir
eect took into account this part of the force only. the nondispersive force
is formally divergent, but can usually be easily regularized. the recipe is
to (i) put x0 =  ; (ii) evaluate the remaining divergent sum over l , from
l = 1 to l = , by the riemann zeta - function method. we stressed the
eciency of this recipe in [1]; cf. also some other related prior papers [5] -
[7]. the method gives, in a simple way, results that are in agreement with
what can be obtained in other ways. the quantum nondispersive force turns
out in our calculation to be repulsive, thus qualitatively in agreement with
the classical result noted above.

(2) there is a dispersive part of the abraham - minkowski force, caused
by the cuto x0 .
in an earlier work on a spherical shell [7] we actually
found the dispersive force to be attractive. the dispersive force is under
usual physical conditions stronger than the nondispersive force. candelas [8]
seems to have been the rst to emphasize the importance of the dispersive
force. his general ideas were later on essentially supported by explicit model
calculations [9], [10].

consider next the second term in (1). this is the electrostriction force. it
generally acts inwards. whether this force is detectable in a real experiment
or not, depends on the detailed circumstances. usually, there is established
a compensating force from the elastic pressure in the interior of the uid, so
that the eect from electrostriction does not show up explicitly in the mea-
surements. only under special conditions, such as in the goetz - zahn non-
equilibrium experiment testing the attractive force between two condenser
plates immersed in a dielectric liquid when there is a high-frequency electric
eld between the plates [11], [12], does one have the possibility to measure
the electrostriction force. the point is that the electromagnetic force will
then vary so quickly that the elastic pressure does not have sucient time to
build itself up. what determines the time scale here, is obviously the transit
time for sound waves in the body. (the goetz - zahn experiment, as well
as some other related experiments, are discussed in detail in [4].) in (1), we
have deliberately written (/)t as an isothermal partial derivative. this
is often appropriate in practical cases, but is an assumption that has to be
considered with some care since if the deformation of the body is occurring
rapidly it will be more appropriate to take the adiabatic derivative (/)s

3

instead. if the uid is non- polar, as one can usually assume at high frequen-
cies, then one need not distinguish between the isothermal and adiabatic
cases since the permittivity depends on density only, though the clausius -
mossotti relation. the electrostrictive contribution to the casimir eect has
not been paid much attention to in the past. there is a paper by one of us
some years ago [13], and recently milton and ng have returned to the topic
[14]. in the present case, where we are considering the casimir force on a
static spherical boundary, it is clear that a compensating elastic pressure will
be built up on the inside. because of this, most possibilities for measuring
the surface force that one may conceive of, would not be able to detect the
electrostrictive contribution at all. a measurement of electrostriction would
require a measurement of the local pressure in the interior region.

consider nally the third term in (1). this is the abraham term, de-
tectable under special circumstances at low frequencies [4], but uctuating
out at higher frequencies, especially at optical frequencies. in our case, the
abraham term does not contribute. it uctuates out.

summing up so far, we see that it is the abraham - minkowski term in
(1) that gives the most important contribution to the surface force. we will
be concerned with this term in the following, and will consider both sub-
classes (1) and (2) listed above. in the next section we highlight the general
green-function formalism, and explain the regularization method that we
use. section 3 is devoted to a study of the nondispersive force. by using the
expansion technique mentioned above we derive the expression for f nondisp,
to order 1/4, in (27). this force is repulsive. some earlier results, derived
by purely analytical means, are corrected. as regards the dispersive force,
considered in section 4, we restrict ourselves to giving essentially estimates.
for high ultraviolet nondimensional cuto x0 the dispersive force is given as
the sum of expressions (39) and (46). the dispersive force for a compact ball
is strong, and it is repulsive. it may be as large as about 106  109 times
the nondispersive force. this fact does not seem to have been universally
recognized before.

we put henceforth h = c = 1. electromagnetic heaviside - lorentz units

are employed.

2 basic formalism. regularization

the general formalism was developed in our earlier paper [1], but for the
benet of the reader we will recapitulate some of the essential points.

the dispersion of the material is accounted for in a simple way, by taking
the permittivity (i) as a function of imaginary frequencies  to be a step

4

function: (i) = n2 = constant > 1 for  < 0, (i) = 1 for  > 0.
thus there is one single absorption frequency 0, serving as an ultraviolet
cuto.

when considering the two-point functions, we let the two spatial points
r and r be separated in the radial direction. there are two scalar green
functions in the problem, fl(r, r) and gl(r, r), dened by

r, r < a : fl, gl = inkjl(nkr<)[h(1)

l (nkr>)  af,g(ka)jl(nkr>)],

(2)

(3)

r, r > a : fl, gl = ikhjl(kr<)  bf,g(ka)h(1)

l (kr<)i h(1)

l (kr>).

here k = ||, jl is the spherical bessel function, and h(1)
the spherical hankel
function of the rst kind. the coecients af,g and bf,g are related to the
boundary.

l

we shall work with the two-point functions that contain the surface -
induced contributions only, and thus have to subtract o the contact terms
corresponding to a uniform medium. it means that the two-point functions
refer to disturbed quantities caused by the boundaries. specically, we let
(i) the contact force on the inner side r = a be calculated as if the inner
medium be lling all space; (ii) the contact force on the outer side r = a+
be calculated as if the outer medium be lling all space. this means that
the rst term in (2) has to be subtracted o as a contact term. similarly the
rst term in (3) has to be subtracted o.

we stress that this method of regularization is not an arbitrary choice. it
is the only kind of regularization that separates o the volume terms, and it
is the only method that permits us to write the relation between the surface
force f and the casimir energy e as f = (1/4a2)e/a. it implies, in
particular, that both the surface force and the casimir energy goes to zero
when the radius goes to innity, what seems to us a most natural result. our
method of regularization is the same as used by milton [15], [16], [18]; cf.
also [14], [17]. it should be mentioned, however, that this method is dierent
from the one advocated recently by carlson et al. [19], [20]. we shall call the
modied two-point functions, constructed by the boundary-related parts of
the green functions only, the eectivetwo-point functions, and write them
as <>ef f . we introduce the nondimensional cuto frequency

and perform a complex frequency rotation

these expressions assume the step-function dispersion relation for n(ix), as
explained above. the value of the constant n for x < x0 is however at this
stage arbitrary; (n  1) is not necessarily small.

the natural question is now: are the force expressions (15) and (17) nite?
the answer is no. this can be seen by means of the uniform asymptotic series
to be employed below, or by direct machine calculation. thus regularization
is called for. the regularization procedure is quite straightforward, at least
for the case of dilute media, the case to which we now turn.

3 nondispersive force

we assume henceforth (n  1) to be a small quantity, and expand the formal-
ism, by means of maple, up to order (n  1)2. we make use of the uniform
asymptotic expansions for the riccati-bessel functions, as explained in [1].
as mentioned above, we insert these expansions up to order 1/4 .

as we mentioned in sect.1, the nondispersive case can be treated by

setting x0 = . we introduce the symbols

z = x/,

t(z) = (1 + z2)1/2,

(19)

and calculate in the interior region the integrand of eq.(15), using the debye
expansion. taking the integral from z = 0 to z =  we obtain

when constructing the total nondispersive surface force density as f nondisp =

1) compensate each other. the surface force accordingly starts with terms
containing (n  1)2.

(the application of the general formalism developed in [1] to dilute balls
contains a calculational error; eq.(94) should have been multiplied by a factor
1/2. therefore the nal conclusion of sect. 4 in [1] is incorrect. we thank
k. a. milton for informing us about this point.)

(24)

here the divergence mentioned above is made explicit; regularization is needed
in the rst two terms. we shall use the riemann zeta function regularization.
this method has in recent years become a standard tool in all areas of quan-
tum eld theory, and is found to be in agreement with what one can derive
by other means, such as the dimensional regularization, cuto regularization,
etc. (cf, for instance, the monograph of elizalde et al. [21]). zeta function
regularization has been applied in the context of spherical dielectrics in [1]
and [7]. an interesting contribution to this technique is further provided by
the recent paper of lambiase et al. [22]. here, no formal divergences appear;
an extra parameter s is introduced whereby all expressions are retained nite.
at the end, an analytical continuation of s is performed. the nal results
are in agreement with what one nds by a straightforward application of the
riemann zeta function technique.

to eectuate this kind of regularization we need in practice only the

formula

according to which

s = (2s  1)(s),

xl=1

0 = 1.

(25)

(26)

the third sum in (24) is nite and is known exactly: p

l=1  2 = (2/2)  4.
from (24) we then get, when writing the force as f nondisp|1/ 4 to emphasize
that it is based upon a uniform asymptotic expansion to order 1/4:

f nondisp|1/ 4 =

(n  1)2

4a4

[

129
65536

+

927

524288

2].

(27)

it is of interest to compare this expression with the expression f nondisp|1/ 2
following from a uniform asymptotic expansion to order 1/2 only:

f nondisp|1/ 2 =

(n  1)2

4a4

33
2048

.

(28)

the reason for this comparison is the following: the combination of terms
occurring in the surface force density (24) involves even powers of 1/ only.

9

the structure of terms is such that the o(1/4) force is somewhat larger than
the correct force, whereas the o(1/2) force is somewhat smaller. from (27)
and (28) we are therefore able to give quite accurate bounds for the exact
nondispersive surface force density f nondisp :

f nondisp|1/ 2 < f nondisp < f nondisp|1/ 4.

(29)

(the term exact here refers to the uniform asymptotic expansion only;
we are of course concerned with a dilute-medium theory of order (n  1)2.)
numerically,

(n  1)2
4a4 0.0161 < f nondisp <

(n  1)2
4a4 0.0194.

(30)

the nondispersive part of the surface force is thus repulsive. the quantum
mechanical result is in this sense in agreement with the prediction of the
abraham-minkowski term in (1).

we note that some care has to be taken to include a sucient number of
terms of the uniform asymptotic expansion when constructing the expression
for f nondisp. to illustrate this, let us see what becomes the result from
including only the rst term in (24) (this corresponds to including only the
zeroth order of the uniform asymptotic expansion). making use of the rst
regularizing equation in (26) we obtain

f nondisp|1/ 0 = 

(n  1)2

4a4

1
64

.

(31)

since 1/64 = 0.0156 we see that the magnitude of (31) is not very dierent
from the second order approximation in (30), but the sign is wrong. we
conclude that it is necessary to go to at least the second order in the uniform
asymptotic expansion to get the sign right. the expression (31) is actually
in precise agreement with the nondispersive force as calculated by milton
[15], [16], and milton and ng [14]. the reason why these authors got a
discrepancy with (30) is simply that they included an insucient number
of terms . in [17] and [18] the following accurate value is given, with the
assistance of numerical methods,

f nondisp =

(n  1)2
4a4 0.01907

(32)

the fourth order result given in (27) is about 1.7 per cent high.

10

4 dispersive force

this case is more dicult to handle than the nondispersive case, and we will
essentially be able to give only order-of-magnitude estimates. we restrict
henceforth the uniform asymptotic expansion to the second order. inclusion
of higher order terms would here be pointless. the ball is assumed to be
dilute, as before.

we now have to keep the nondimensional ultraviolet cuto x0 = 0a as a
nite quantity in thr formalism. one may ask: what are the physically rea-
sonable magnitudes of x0 ? we note that x0 is here an external parameter
that has to be inserted into the formalism by hand. its value is given by the
cuto frequency 0 , which is determined by the molecular structure of the
medium, and by the radius a. we will take 0 to lie in the ultraviolet re-
gion. it seems reasonable, by comparison with the lorentz dispersion model
(cf. [23], for instance), to put 0 = 3  1016s1. thus in dimensional units,
assuming a small ball with radius a = 1m, we get x0 = 0a/c = 100. balls
with somewhat larger radii can also be actual. accordingly,

100  x0  1000

seems to be a reasonable range for x0.

another question is: what is the upper physical limit l = l0 to be taken
in the summations? this point becomes accentuated by the circumstance
that some of the sums are formally divergent. obviously, this behaviour is a
spurious eect. our dispersion relation, as explained in the beginning of sect.
2, implies that photons having frequencies  higher than 0 do not see the
medium at all. if a photon of limiting frequency 0 just touches the surface of
the sphere, its angular momentum is equal to 0a , i.e., equal to x0. we thus
expect, on physical grounds, that l0 is of the same order as x0. this kind
of argument has repeatedly been used in casimir calculations [8], [7], [24].
it means that one connes oneself to giving order-of-magnitude estimates
rather than exact numbers. the physical force, of course, is a denite number
in a given case, but to evaluate it one needs detailed information about the
dispersive structure of the medium. that lies outside the scope of the present
paper.

adding (15) and (17), making use of the second order approximation, we

here the rst and the second integral stem respectively from the zeroth, and
the second, order terms in the uniform asymptotic expansion. we write f
as a sum of two terms, one zeroth order term a and one second order term
b, and consider b rst. this term is more easy to handle than the term a,
since the sums over l in b are convergent and can be calculated by means of
the euler-maclaurin formula [2]. it is convenient to write b in the form

the expressions (40) and (41) are seen to be equal. this brings us to the
following important conclusion: if we perform a dispersive calculation of the
surface force, to second order, we nd a term that is independent of the
cuto. this term is precisely equal to the second order contribution within
a calculation that is nondispersive from the outset. in the second case zeta-
function regularization is being employed, while in the rst case it is not.

we will only be able to give an order-of-magnitude analysis of the physically

ing point: take the nondispersive limit, x0 = . then only the last term in
(42) survives and we get, again employing zeta function regularization,

this is precisely the same as the expression (31), and serves as a corollary of
our dispersive calculation.

now return to the dispersive case, and estimate the contribution to the
sum in (42) from low and moderate values of l, such that   x0. when
  x0, we see that the two rst terms in (42) are negligible in comparison
to the third term. moreover, when  = x0 the two rst terms compensate
each other. consequently we may write

here the variation in the factor arctan(x0/) is moderate; it decreases from
/2 for small  , to /4 when x0 =  . for estimate purposes we may replace
arctan(x0/) by a constant c, where c lies in the interval /4  c  /2.
the sum in (44) then becomes simple to evaluate, since

(46)

it is here natural to argue such as we did above, in connection with (40)
and (41). we may thus associate the x0- independent part of (46) with the

14

nondispersive surface force, calculated according to the zeroth order uniform
asymptotic expansion. actually, if we equate the x0 - independent part
(arising from the last term in (46)) to the expression (31), we obtain c =
/2. this is precisely the value of c corresponding to the small values
of  , according to our discussion above. we may thus conclude that the
nondispersive part of the force, at least as far as the leading term is concerned,
is associated with the low angular momenta l .

when x0 is included, (46) predicts under usual physical circumstances
a strong, repulsive force. for instance, if we take c = /2 and x0 = 100,
we nd that (46) is about 106 as large as the nondispersive second order
(or fourth order) force given in (30). this large dierence can be expected
to be quite important, in practice. an eclatant example to think about is
the sonoluminescence eect [14]. we will briey return to this point in the
conclusion section.

the result (46) was derived under the assumption of low and moderate
nondimensional frequencies,   x0. is there an appreciable contribution to
a from higher frequencies also? we think that this is not so, the reason being,
as explained above, that photons with  > 0 do not see the medium. it
is physically speaking most safe to truncate the l summation at   x0
and adopt (46) as a reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate of the leading
dispersive term. the total surface force density f is thus estimated adding
the expressions (46) and (39).

finally we mention the following alternative method of handling the di-
vergent sum a, which may appear mathematically convenient. the method
consists in adding and subtracting the weakly divergent sum representing a
in the frequency region  > x0. starting from (42) we see that this amounts
to writing

where we have chosen to let the sums over l in the extra terms run from
1 to innity. the advantage of writing a in this way is that the rst of
the two sums in (47) is nite, and that we have explicit control over the
divergence in the second sum. let the rst sum be denoted by a(nite).
making a numerical calculation of this expression at the lower and upper

limits x0 = 100 and x0 = 1000, we get approximately

(48)

a graphical representation of a(nite) versus x0 shows that the variation
is roughly linear in the actual frequency region. exploiting this fact, and
truncating the second sum in (47) at l = x0, we arrive at the following
estimate for a:

it is seen, in fact, that the structure of (49)
is not very dierent from the structure of our previous estimate (46). the
advantage of (49) in comparison with (46), of course, is that there appears
no extra constant c to be estimated separately.

5 conclusion and nal remarks

the physical model considered in this paper is that of a compact dilute spher-
ical ball, surrounded by a vacuum. the dispersion relation of the material
is such that n(i) = n = const when the imaginary frequency  is lower
than the ultraviolet cuto frequency 0 whereas n(i) = 1 for higher  .
this is a very simple dispersion relation: we know on general grounds that
n(i), being closely related to a so-called generalized susceptibility, is real on
the positive imaginary frequency axis and decreases monotonically towards
1 when    (cf., for instance, [25]). however, this is not a serious restric-
tion here as we may well imagine that n(i) instead is endowed with a small
negative slope for  < 0.

the nondimensional cuto is x0 = 0a, a being the radius of the ball.
under typical physical conditions, if the radius lies in the interval 1m 
a  10m, we expect that 100  x0  1000.

our basic green function formalism (sect. 2) is taylor expanded in
(n  1) up to the second order, and is expanded in 1/ up to the fourth
order ( = l + 1/2). the maple v program here proves to be an eective
tool.

the surface force density f is constructed by taking the dierence be-
tween the radial maxwell stress tensor components on the two sides of the
boundary r = a . alternatively, f can be found as the integral of the radial
component of the volume force density f across the boundary. the general

16

expression for f is given in (1), and the meaning of the various terms is dis-
cussed. only the rst, and under usual conditions most important, term (the
abraham - minkowski term) is further considered in this paper

the nondispersive force is calculated in sect.3. formally, this case is
treated by setting x0 = , and regularizing the divergent sums using the
riemann zeta function. working to the order 1/4 in the uniform asymptotic
expansion, the nondispersive force is given by (27) and (30). a slightly more
accurate value is given by (32). this force is repulsive.

we emphasize that f nondisp is a physical force; the expression is not merely
a formal outcome of a more or less arbitrary regularization procedure. it is
here of interest to note that, in addition to the green function approach
above, there has recently been developed also two other alternative proce-
dures which lead to results supporting our statement:

first, one may consider the problem from a microscopic point of view and
calculate the mutual van der waals energy for the molecules in the compact
sphere. this has been done by milton and ng [26]. the van der waals energy
for two molecules is v = b/r7, with b a positive constant. integrating this
over the sphere one nds a divergent expression which has to be regularized,
conveniently by means of dimensional regularization. the nite remaining
part of the energy becomes

e =

(  1)2

a

23
1536

(50)

associating the van der waals energy e with the surface force f via the
relation f = (1/4a2)e/a, we nd the same numerical result for f =
f nondisp as in eq. (32).

second, one can calculate the mutual energy between the molecules in
the sphere by employing quantum mechanical perturbation theory. this has
been done by barton [27], for a dilute sphere. he used an exponential cuto
for the wave numbers. again, the formal expression for e was found to
diverge, but after omission of the cuto dependent terms, the result was
found to be precisely in agreement with the expression (50).

these two recent alternative developments are welcome, since they signify
that a consensus between various approaches to the dicult casimir surface
force problem is nally in sight.

we emphasize that the repulsive force f nondisp, although being a physical
force and thus measurable in principle, is not the total surface force, not
even for a nondispersive medium. the total force is necessarily attractive,
since it results from the attractive van der waals force between molecules.
(this point was apparently regnogized very early, by davies in his classic
paper [28].) at rst sight it may perhaps be surprising that we operate with

17

a measurable force component which is only a part of the total force. this
kind of situation is however known also from other areas in electrodynamics,
and it by be instructive in the present context to discuss briey the following
two examples:

1) consider the situation where a high intensity laser beam falls vertically
from above on a liquid (water) surface. the surface bulges out, corresponding
to an outward-directed force. the elevation is slight, of the order of 1 m,
but is clearly detectable. this is the famous ashkin- dziedzic experiment
[29]. the elevation can be described completely, using only the abraham-
minkowski force term, i.e., the rst term in (1).

the abraham-minkowski force is however not the only force acting on the
water surface. there is an additional force, arising from electrostriction, and
this force is stronger than the rst-mentioned one such that the total force on
the surface is actually compressive. electrostriction does not contribute to
the elevating force, as mentioned earlier, since electrostriction merely com-
presses the column of liquid. the theory of the ashkin-dziedcic experiment
has been given in [30] and [4].

2) a second, related, situation is the one discussed in many textbooks (
cf. [3], for instance), namely two parallel condenser plates partly immersed in
a dielectric liquid. when a strong static electric eld is applied between the
plates, the liquid is observed to rise slightly in the interior region. the situa-
tion is more involved than one might be inclined to think. again, the observ-
able elevation can be descibed entirely with use of the abraham-minkowski
force only. there is in addition the compressive electrostriction force acting,
so that the total surface force density is compressive. the electrostriction
force has to be the stronger member of the two forces, since otherwise the
column of liquid would not be kept together as a whole. the mathematical
reason why the electrostriction force is the stronger one, is that the relative
permittivity is larger than 1. this is a thermodynamical result. seen from
this perspective, the deepest reason why the column of liquid is kept together,
is neither hydrodynamics nor electrodynamics, but rather thermodynamics.
the theory of this situation is discussed, among other places, in [4] and [31].
the lesson to be learned from the above two examples is fairly obvious:
it is physically quite legitimate to consider a part of the complete surface
force, and discuss its experimental consequences, without drawing the com-
plete force into consideration at all. this is precisely what we do in principle
when we discuss the casimir force f nondisp. we are not aware of any con-
crete operational argument so far to really measure f nondisp experimentally,
however.

consider next the dispersive force. it was calculated in sect. 4, to second
order in the asymptotic expansion. the force is written as a sum of two

18

terms, f = a + b, where the second order term b is given in (39). this
term, although strictly speaking derived for high cutos only, x0  , is
expected to be fairly accurate for all values of x0 that are actual in practice.
the term b has the same basic structure as the surface force calculated
earlier on a spherical shell [7]: there is an attractive part linear in x0, which
is due to dispersion, and in addition a repulsive part which is dispersion
independent. under usual physical conditions the rst of these two parts is
the stronger one.

as for the leading term a, of zeroth order, we have only been able to
give an order-of-magnitude analysis, based upon physical arguments allowing
us to truncate the divergent sums over l at an upper limit approximately
equal to x0. we gave two estimates for a, in equations (46) and (49). the
structures of these two expressions are seen to be roughly similar. under
usual circumstances also the force a is a repulsive one.

to get an idea about the magnitudes involved, let us limit ourselves to

the dominant rst term in (46), putting for deniteness c = /2. then

this force may easily be about 106 as strong as the nondispersive force (27).

(52)

this energy is always negative, and has its maximum when the radius is at
minimum. moreover it is independent of the substitution n  1/n, when n
is close to unity. one would therefore think that the formula is equally well
applicable to the case when there is a vacuum bubble immersed in a dilute
dielectric medium.

one may wonder whether it is possible to apply the present kind of the-
ory to the phenomenon of sonoluminescence (an instructive review of this
phenomenon has recently been given by cheeke [32]. it is well known that
the energies involved in the nondispersive casimir eect are far too small to
account for the sonoluminescence eect. can the very large magnitude of
(52) save the situation? we see that by taking (n  1)2  0.1, x0  1000
(corresponding to a  10m), we obtain from (52) edisp  2  104ev . the
magnitude of this energy is probably acceptable, but the sign is apparently
wrong [16], [14]. at least the sign is in conict with energy emission during
the collapse. consider, however, the following argument: an experimental

19

fact is that the photon ash does not occur during the whole collapse period
but instead precisely at the end of that period, when a = amin  1m. imag-
ine now that the energy of the burst of photons were really taken from the
casimir energy at this particular instant. consequently there would occur
an energy imbalance in the system. the balance of casimir energy would be
restored if the bubble were increasing its radius out to a  10m.

such a movement actually happens. evidently, we do not explain the
sonoluminescence eect by this kind of argument. our aim is more modest,
viz. to suggest that sonoluminescence is perhaps not totally unrelated to the
casimir eect after all.

the last point that we shall dwell on in this paper, is the inuence from
absorption in the medium. this is an important point since it shows the
physical limitations of our adopted material model, and the directions for
further research. at rst sight, it would seem as if absorption does not cre-
ate any problems at all in the theory: we are after all adopting a model in
which the quantity n(i) is real and shows a simple though physically ac-
ceptable behaviour along the positive imaginary frequency axis. absorption
should accordingly be taken into account implicitly in the theory, through
the kramers-kronig relations, which lead to a complex behaviour of n()
along the real frequency axis. the problem waiting for a complete solution
lies at another place, namely in our adoption of formulas (7) and (8) for
the eective products. these are the same formulas as for a nondispersive
medium. a more complete theory would have to take into account the cou-
pling of the molecules to a heat reservoir, with a corresponding quantization
of the source currents. this would in turn imply the presence of langevin
terms in the eective products.
interesting developments of the theory of
absorptive media, implying a quantization of the complete system (medium
plus reservoir) have been given in [33], [34], and most recently, in [35] and
[36]. we only point to this problem here, without going into any detail.
for the convenience of the reader, we summarize in appendix b the basic
assumptions leading to our formulas for the eective products.

and f nondisp

our calculation of the nondispersive force in sect.3 was based on a dilute-ball
expansion up to order (n  1)2, and on an asymptotic expansion up to order
1/4. a characteristic property was found to be that terms of order (n  1)
in f nondisp
compensated each other, so that the leading term in
ext
f nondisp = f nondisp
would go as (n  1)2; cf. (20) and (22). one
may ask: what happens if one makes a higher order expansion in (n  1), will
then terms containing odd powers in (n  1) continue to compensate each
other? we shall investigate this point, giving the expansions for f nondisp
and f nondisp
up to order (n  1)5. however, we will now have to truncate
the uniform asymptotic expansion at order 1/2. (a combined set of higher
order expansions in (n  1), as well as 1/ , turned out to be beyond the
capacity of our maple program.)

the rst term in this expression agrees with our previous second order result
(28). we see that odd powers in (n  1) generally do not compensate each
other in the surface force. all powers in (n1) are present, with the exception
of the rst, linear, term. the expansion given above may be useful also in
cases when (n  1) is not so small, perhaps up to (n  1)  0.3  0.4.

b the eective products derived from statis-

tical mechanics

assuming for deniteness schwingers source theory, we relate the electric
eld components ei(x) to the polarization components pk(x) via a tensor
ik(x, x):

ei(x) =z d4x ik(x, x) pk(x)

(54)

stationarity of the system means that ik depends on time only through the
dierence  = t  t. causality implies that the integration over t is limited

21

to t  t. from a statistical mechanical viewpoint, ik(x, x) is a generalized
susceptibility [25].

introduce the fourier transform ik(r, r, ) via

ik(x, x) =z 



d
2

ei ik(r, r, )

(55)

the basic equation (54), in combination with the causality principle, are thus
the necessary conditions for causing the function ik(r, r, ) to satisfy the
following properties:

(i) it is a regular, one-valued function in the upper half frequency plane.

at innity (||  ), it goes to zero.

(ii) there is no singularity on the real axis (except at the origin, in the

case of a metal).

(iii) the function does not take real values at any nite point in the upper

half plane except on the imaginary axis.

now invoke kubos formula from statistical mechanics: it states that the
spectral generalized susceptibility is related to the commutator between eld
components as

ik(r, r, ) = iz 

0

d ei h[ei(x), ek(x)]i

(56)

for instance, [25]). this means that the generalized susceptibility is
ik(x, x). for
ik(x, x) vanish, the rst because of causality, the

(cf.
identiable with the retarded green function: ik(x, x) = gr
t < t both ik(x, x) and gr
second because of the denition of the retarded green function.

consider now the two-point function hei(x)ek(x)i. its fourier transform
hei(r, )ek(r, )i can be expressed in terms of the quantity hei(r)ek(r)i
(the spectral correlation tensor) as

hei(r, )ek(r, )i = 2hei(r)ek(r)i ( + )

(57)

the crucial step now is to apply the uctuation-dissipation theorem [25],
according to which

hei(r)ek(r)i = im gr

ik(r, r, ) coth(

the causal integration contour in the complex frequency plane we obtain,
after a complex frequency rotation, the eective products as given in eqs.(7)
and (8).
