abstract. this is a review of recent work on the chiral extensions of the wznw
phase space describing both the extensions based on elds with generic monodromy
as well as those using bloch waves with diagonal monodromy. the symplectic form
on the extended phase space is inverted in both cases and the chiral wznw elds
are found to satisfy quadratic poisson bracket relations characterized by monodromy
dependent exchange r-matrices. explicit expressions for the exchange r-matrices in terms
of the arbitrary monodromy dependent 2-form appearing in the chiral wznw symplectic
form are given. the exchange r-matrices in the general case are shown to satisfy a
new dynamical generalization of the classical modied yang-baxter (yb) equation and
poisson-lie (pl) groupoids are constructed that encode this equation analogously as pl
groups encode the classical yb equation. for an arbitrary simple lie group g, exchange
r-matrices are exhibited that are in one-to-one correspondence with the possible pl
structures on g and admit them as pl symmetries.

1 introduction

the wess-zumino-novikov-witten (wznw) model [1] of conformal eld theory has
proved to be the source of interesting structures that play an increasingly important
role in theoretical physics and in mathematics [2, 3]. one of the fascinating aspects of
the model is that in addition to its built-in ane kac-moody symmetry it also exhibits
certain quantum group properties [4]. the quantum group properties were originally
discovered in the quantized model, which raised the question to nd their classical ana-
logues. the studies at the beginning of the nineties led to the consensus that the origin
of these quantum group properties lies in the poisson-lie symmetries of the so called
chiral wznw phase space that emerges after splitting the left- and right-moving degrees
of freedom [5]-[16]. the chiral separation arises from the product form of the solution
of the wznw eld equation given by g(xl, xr) = gl(xl)g1
r (xr), where xc (c = l, r)
are lightcone coordinates and the gc are quasiperiodic group valued elds with equal
monodromies, gc(x + 2) = gc(x)m for some m in the wznw group g. the chiral
wznw poisson structures found in the literature have the form

ngc(x) , gc(y)o =

1

c(cid:16)gc(x)  gc(y)(cid:17)(cid:16)r +

1
2

i sign (y  x)(cid:17),

0 < x, y < 2,

(1.1)

where i is given by the quadratic casimir of the simple lie algebra, g, of the wznw
group, g, and the interesting object is the exchange r-matrix r. these classical ex-
change algebras can be regarded as fundamental since the current algebra follows as
their consequence, and help to better understand the quantum group properties of the
model by means of canonical quantization [17, 18, 19]. however, the choice of the chiral
poisson structure is highly non-unique due to the fact that the gc are determined by the
physical eld g only up to the gauge freedom gc 7 gch for any constant h  g.

there are two qualitatively dierent cases that correspond to building the wznw
eld out of chiral elds with diagonal monodromy (bloch waves) or out of elds with
generic monodromy. for bloch waves [9, 10, 11], the poisson structure is essentially
unique and the associated r-matrix is a solution of the so called classical dynamical
yang-baxter (cdyb) equation, which has recently received a lot of attention [20]. for
chiral elds with generic monodromy, it has been argued in [12, 15] that the possible
exchange r-matrices should correspond to certain local dierential 2-forms  on open
domains g  g, whose exterior derivative is the 3-form that occurs in the wznw
action. until recently, the precise connection between  and r has not been elaborated,
and in most papers dealing with generic monodromy actually only those very special
cases were considered for which r is a monodromy independent constant.

we here review the main results obtained in our recent papers [21, 22], where a
detailed analysis of the chiral extensions of the wznw phase space was undertaken.
the next section contains an outline of the background to the problem. the subsequent

1

two sections describe the chiral wznw hamiltonian structures in detail. the nal section
is devoted to an interpretation of these structures in terms of poisson-lie groupoids.

2 chiral extensions of the wznw phase space

we below describe the wznw hamiltonian system and the chiral extension of its solution
space following the spirit of [12, 15].

we consider a simple, real or complex, lie algebra, g, with a corresponding connected
lie group, g, and identify the phase space of the wznw model associated with the group
g as

m = t  eg = { (g, jl) | g  eg, jl  eg },

(2.1)

where eg = c (s1, g) is the loop group and eg = c (s1, g) is its lie algebra. the
isomorphism of the cotangent bundle t  eg with eg  eg is established by means of right-
translations on eg. the elements g  eg (resp. jl  eg) are modeled as 2-periodic

g-valued (resp. g-valued) functions on the real line r. the phase space is equipped with
the symplectic form

 = dz 2

d tr(cid:16)jldgg1(cid:17) +



2 z 2

0

d tr(cid:16)dgg1(cid:17) (cid:16)dgg1(cid:17)

(2.2)

with some constant . here prime denotes derivative with respect to the space variable,
  r, and for any a, b  g tr (ab) denotes a xed multiple of the cartan-killing
if t and t  ( = 1, . . . , dim g) are dual bases of g, tr (tt ) = 
,
form on g.
then tr (ab) = ab with a = tr (at), b = tr (bt ) and the usual summation
convention in force. for the wedge product we use the conventions in [23].

although the expression of  appears rather formal at rst sight, it can be used
to unambiguously associate hamiltonian vector elds and poisson brackets (pbs) with a
set of admissible functions, which include, for example, the fourier components of the
wznw eld g, the left-current jl and the right-current jr given by

jr = g1jlg + g1g.

(2.3)

the currents are the momentum maps that generate two commuting actions of eg on m
that correspond respectively to left- and right-translations on eg. this means that the

following local pb relations are valid:

{ tr (tjl)() , tr (tjl)() }w z = tr ([t, t]jl)() +  tr (tt) 

{ tr (tjr)() , tr (t jr)() }w z = tr ([t, t]jr)()   tr (tt) 

{ g() , tr (tjl)() }w z = tg() 

{ g() , tr (tjr)() }w z = g()t ,

(2.4)

2

together with {jl(), jr()}w z = 0, where  := (  ) = 1
pbs can be derived from the symplectic form , whose precise meaning is explained in
several papers (see e.g. [24]). thus we need not dwell on this point, but note that in the
case of a complex lie algebra the admissible functions depend holomorphically on the
matrix elements of g, jl, jr in the nite dimensional irreducible representations of g,

2 pnz ein(). these

and eg  eg is then a model of the holomorphic cotangent bundle.

the phase space m represents the initial data for the wznw system, whose dynamics

is generated by the hamiltonian

hamiltons equation can be written in the alternative forms [1]

lg = jlg,

rjl = 0  rg = gjr,

ljr = 0.

(2.7)

let msol be the space of solutions of the wznw system. msol consists of the smooth
g-valued functions g(,  ) which are 2-periodic in  and satisfy r(lg g1) = 0. the
general solution of this evolution equation can be written as

g(,  ) = gl(xl)g1

r (xr),

(2.8)

where (gl, gr) is any pair of g-valued, smooth, quasiperiodic function on r with equal
monodromies,
i.e., for c = l, r one has gc(xc + 2) = gc(xc)m with some c-
independent m  g. to elaborate this representation of the solutions in more detail, we

dene the space cm:

cm := {(gl, gr)|gl,r  c (r, g),

there is a free right-action of g on cm given by

gl,r(x + 2) = gl,r(x)m m  g}.

(2.9)

g  h : (gl, gr) 7 (glh, grh).

(2.10)

notice that cm is a principal bre bundle over msol with respect to the above action of
g. the projection of this bundle,  : cm  msol, is given by

 : (gl, gr) 7 g = glg1
r

i.e.

g(,  ) = gl(xl)g1

r (xr).

(2.11)

we can identify m with msol by associating the elements of the solution space with

their initial data at  = 0. formally, this is described by the map  : msol  m,

 : msol  g(,  ) 7 (cid:16)g(, 0), jl() = (lg g1)(, 0)(cid:17)  m.

d tr(cid:16)g1dg(cid:17)  (cid:16)g1dg(cid:17)(cid:19) | =0
regarding now msol as the base of the bundle  : cm  msol, we obtain a closed 2-form,
b, on cm, b := (). by substituting the explicit formula (2.11) of , one nds

where chir is the so called chiral wznw 2-form:

c (cid:17) ,
c dgc)(0)  dmc m 1

mc = g1

c (x)gc(x + 2).

(2.15)

this crucial formula of b was rst obtained by gawedzki [12].

since it is degenerate. of course, its restriction to any (local) section of the bundle

it is clear from its denition that db = 0, but b is not a symplectic form on cm,
 : cm  msol is a symplectic form, since such sections yield (local) models of msol. on

the other hand, one can check that chir has a non-vanishing exterior derivative [12]:

dchir(gc) = 

1
6

tr (cid:16)m 1

c dmc  m 1

c dmc  m 1

(2.16)

c dmc(cid:17) .

although this cancels from db, since ml = mr for the elements of cm, it makes the

chiral separation of the wznw degrees of freedom a very non-trivial problem.

the idea of the chiral separation arises from the observation that the currents jc
r , by

almost completely determine the chiral wznw elds gc, and thus also g = glg1
means of the dierential equations

ccgc = jcgc

for c = l, r.

(2.17)

thus it appears an interesting possibility to construct the wznw model as a reduction
of a simpler model, in which the left- and right-moving degrees of freedom would be sepa-
rated in terms of completely independent chiral elds gl and gr regarded as fundamental
variables. it is clear that the solution space of such a chirally extended model must be a
direct product of two identical but independent spaces, i.e., it must have the form

mc := {gc | gc  c (r, g),

gc(x + 2) = gc(x)mc mc  g}.

cmext := ml  mr,

(2.18)

(2.19)

ideally, one would like to endow the space cmext with a symplectic structure, b
reduces to b on the submanifold cm  cmext dened by the periodicity constraint
ml = mr. it is easy to see that these requirements force b
chir(gl) + r

ext to have the following form:

ext, that

chir(gr),

(2.20)

ext(gl, gr) = l
b

4



chir(gc) = chir(gc) + (mc)

(2.21)

with some 2-form  depending only on the monodromy of gc. since in the extended model
the factors (mc, c

chir) should be symplectic manifolds separately, the condition

d

chir =

6

tr (cid:16)m 1

c dmc  m 1

c dmc  m 1

c dmc(cid:17) + d(mc) = 0

(2.22)

arises. but then we have to face the problem that no globally dened smooth 2-form
exists on g that would satisfy this condition for all mc  g.

there are two rather dierent way-outs from the above diculty [15]. the rst is to
restrict the possible domain of the monodromy matrix mc to some open submanifold in
g on which an appropriate 2-form  may be found. we refer to a choice of such a domain
and 2-form  as a chiral extension of the wznw system with generic monodromy.

the second possibility is to restrict the domain of the allowed monodromy matrices
much more drastically from the beginning, in such a way that after the restriction dchir
vanishes, whereby the diculty disappears. for example, one may achieve this by re-
stricting the monodromy matrices to vary in a xed maximal torus of g, which amounts
to constructing (a subset of) the solutions of the wznw eld equation in terms of chiral
bloch waves. this second possibility is especially natural in the case of compact or
complex lie groups, for which there is only one maximal torus up to conjugation. geo-
metrically, the restriction to bloch waves corresponds to taking a (local) section of the

bundle  : cm  msol.

3 hamiltonian structures for generic monodromy

we here investigate the chiral wznw phase space mc introduced above. the analysis
is the same for both chiralities, c = l, r, and we simplify our notation by putting mchir
for mc and g, m,  for gc, mc, c, respectively. thus mchir is parametrized by the
g-valued, smooth, quasiperiodic eld g(x) satisfying the monodromy condition

g(x + 2) = g(x)m

m  g.

(3.1)

the corresponding chiral current, j(x) = g(x)g1(x)  g, is a smooth, 2-periodic
function of x. we then consider a 2-form  on a domain g  g, for which we assume
6 tr (m 1dm)3 and let mchir  mchir be the set of chiral wznw
that d(m) = 1
elds whose monodromy matrix lies in g. it turns out that 
chir denes a symplectic
structure on mchir if a further condition holds for the pair ( g, ). in order to describe
this condition let us introduce the parametrization

(m) =

1
2

q(m)tr(tm 1dm)  tr(tm 1dm),

q = q,

(3.2)

5

with t denoting a basis of g, whose dual basis with respect to tr is t . for any m  g,
then also introduce the linear operator q(m) : g  g by

q(m) : t  7 q(m)t,

(3.3)

as well as its shifts, q(m) := q(m)  1
condition that we need is that

2i, by the identity operator i. the further

det(cid:16)q+(m)  q(m)  ad m 1(cid:17) 6= 0

m  g.

(3.4)

this condition will guarantee the (weak) non-degeneracy of 

chir on mchir.

to use 

chir in practice we need to establish some notation for tangent vectors x[g]
at g  mchir and vector elds x over the chiral phase space. to this end we consider
smooth curves on mchir described by functions (x, t)  g satisfying

(x + 2, t) = (x, t)m(t)

m(t)  g;

(x, 0) = g(x).

(3.5)

x[g] is obtained as the velocity to the curve at t = 0, encoded by the g-valued, smooth
function

(x) :=

.

(3.6)

d
dt

g1(x)(x, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

the monodromy properties of (x) can be derived by taking the derivative of the rst
equation in (3.5): (x+2) = m 1(x)m, and this can be solved in terms of a g-valued,

smooth, 2-periodic function, xj  eg, and a constant lie algebra element, 0, as follows:

dy g1(y)xj(y)g(y).

(3.7)

(x) = 0 +z x

0

a vector eld x on mchir is an assignment, g 7 x[g], of a vector to every point

g  mchir. thus it can be specied by the assignments g 7 0[g]  g and g 7 xj[g]  eg.

using any curve that denes x[g], x acts on a dierentiable function, g 7 f [g], on mchir
as

x(f )[g] =

gt(x) = (x, t) .

(3.8)

note that the evaluation functions f x[g] := g(x) and f x[g] := j(x) are dierentiable
with respect to any vector eld, and their derivatives are given by

d
dt

f [gt](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

x(g(x)) = g(x)(x)

and

x(j(x)) = xj (x).

(3.9)

this claries the meaning of xj as well.
it is also obvious from its denition that
the monodromy matrix yields a g-valued dierentiable function on mchir, g 7 m =
g1(x)g(x + 2), whose derivative is characterized by the g-valued function

x(m)m 1 = m(x + 2)m 1  (x).

(3.10)

6

having dened vector elds, one can also introduce dierential forms as usual. we only
remark that by (3.9) evaluation 1-forms like dg(x), dj(x) or (g1dg)(x) are perfectly
well-dened: e.g. dg(x)(x) = x(g(x)) = g(x)(x).

let us now show that 

chir is weakly non-degenerate, that is 

chir(x, y ) = 0 x

only for y = 0, if and only if (3.4) holds. in order to compute



chir(x, y ) = chir(x, y ) + (x, y )

(3.11)

for two arbitrary vector elds, we take x to be parametrized by (x) and further by the
pair (0, xj (x)), while the analogous parametrization for y is given by (x) and the pair
(0, yj(x)). then a straightforward calculation gives that

chir(x, y ) = z 2



0

dxtr(cid:16)xj (x)g(x)(cid:16)(x) + q(m)(m 1y (m))(cid:17)g1(x)(cid:17)

+ tr (cid:16)0 (q(m)  ad m  q+(m)) (m 1y (m))(cid:17) .

(3.12)

this vanishes for every x, that is for arbitrary xj  eg and 0  g, if and only if

(q(m)  ad m  q+(m)) (m 1y (m)) = 0,

(x) + q(m)(m 1y (m)) = 0. (3.13)

since the transpose with respect to the scalar product on g satises

(q(m)  ad m  q+(m))t = (cid:16)q(m)  ad m 1  q+(m)(cid:17) ,

(3.14)

if (3.4) holds then it follows from (3.13) that (x) must vanish, that is y = 0. thus
we proved that (3.4) implies the non-degeneracy of 
chir. the converse statement is
also easy to establish, since if the determinant in (3.4) vanished say at m 0, then there
would exist a non-zero a  g such that (q(m 0)  ad m 0  q+(m 0)) (a) = 0. we
could hence dene a tangent vector y 0 at a corresponding point in mchir by 0(x) =
q(m 0)(a), and this vector would annihilate 
chir. (the denition of y 0 is consistent
since 0(x + 2)  (m 0)10(x)m 0 = a holds.)

now we turn to our main problem: for a dierentiable (scalar) function f on the

phase space mchir, we wish to nd a corresponding vector eld, y f , satisfying

x(f ) = 

chir(x, y f )

(3.15)

for all vector elds x. notice that y f does not necessarily exist for a given f . we
say that f is an element of the set of admissible hamiltonians, denoted as h, if the
corresponding hamiltonian vector eld, y f , exists. on account of the non-degeneracy of


chir, if y f exists then it is uniquely determined.

we may use the formula (3.12) for y := y f to establish the following three necessary

and sucient conditions that f must obey to guarantee that y f exists:

7

 there must exist a smooth g-valued function on r, af (x), and a constant lie algebra
element, af , such that for any vector eld x

x(f ) = z 2

0

dxtr(cid:16)xj (x)af (x)(cid:17) + tr (0af ).

(3.16)

(this means that f  h must have an exterior derivative parametrized by the assignments
g 7 af (x)[g] and g 7 af [g]. the restriction of af (x) to x  [0, 2] and af are
uniquely determined by (3.16), and af (x) is made a unique function on r by the next
requirement.)
 the expression

(3.17)

(3.18)

haf (x), j(x)i + 

daf (x)

dx

must dene a smooth 2-periodic function on r.
 af (x) and af must be related by

af = g1(0)haf (0)  af (2)ig(0).

if these conditions are satised, then y f is in fact given by

g1(x)y f (g(x)) = g1(x)af (x)g(x) 

1
2

af + r(m)(af ) ,

(3.19)

where r(m) is the linear operator on g dened by

r(m) =

1

2 (cid:16)q+(m)  q(m)  ad (m 1)(cid:17)1

(cid:16)q+(m) + q(m)  ad (m 1)(cid:17) .

(3.20)

note that the matrix r(m) of r(m) is antisymmetric. later we shall also use the
operators r(m) := r(m)  1

2 i and the corresponding g  g-valued functions on g:

r(m) := r(m)t  t,

r(m) = r(m) 

i,

1
2

i = t   t.

(3.21)

the above explicit description of the hamiltonian map f 7 y f induced by 

chir

on mchir is one of our main results [21]. its proof can be sketched as follows. first, by
assuming that (3.15) holds we see from (3.12) for y = y f that at every point in the
phase space x(f ) has the form (3.16) with

g1(x)af (x)g(x) = (x) + q(m)(m 1y f (m)),

af = (q(m)  ad m  q+(m)) (m 1y f (m)).

(3.22)

(3.23)

since by the meaning of tangent vectors we must have (x) = g1(x)y f
taking the derivative of (3.22) we immediately get that

j (x)g(x), by

y f (j(x)) = [af (x), j(x)] + xaf (x)

(3.24)

8

must hold, which in particular means that the right hand side must dene a smooth,
2-periodic function on r. as for equation (3.18), this is a direct consequence of (3.22)
and (3.23) by taking into account that as a tangent vector y f satises

m 1y f (m) = (2)  m 1(0)m.

(3.25)

this proves that the elements of h indeed meet the conditions (3.16), (3.17), (3.18).
moreover, if the hamiltonian vector eld exists then by combining (3.22) and (3.23) we
obtain

g1(x)y f (g(x)) = g1(x)af (x)g(x) q(m)  (q(m)  ad m  q+(m))1 (af ), (3.26)

which is equivalent to (3.19), since for the operator r(m) dened by (3.20)

r(m) = q(m)  (q(m)  ad m  q+(m))1

(3.27)

is an identity. to complete the proof, one checks that if the expression in (3.17) is 2-
periodic, then (3.19) gives a well-dened vector eld (since g1(x)y f (g(x + 2))m 1 
g1(x)y f (g(x)) is independent of x), which satises (3.15) if (3.16) and (3.18) hold.

now we elaborate the hamiltonian vector eld for some particular elements in h. first
note that the matrix elements of the evaluation functions f x and f x fail to satisfy the
rst condition, thus they are not in h. however, their smeared out versions

f := z 2

0

dxtr(cid:16)(x)j(x)(cid:17),

f[g] := z 2

0

dxtr(cid:16)(x)g(x)(cid:17),

(3.28)

(where in dening f we use a representation  : g  gl(v ) of g with g = (g)
and a smooth test function  : r  end(v )) can be shown to belong to h, if (x) is
a g-valued, smooth, 2-periodic test function, and  satises (k)(0) = (k)(2) = 0 for
every integer k  0. the corresponding hamiltonian vector elds obtained from (3.19)
satisfy

y f(g(x)) = (x)g(x),

y f(j(x)) = [(x), j(x)] + (x),

y f(m) = 0,

(3.29)

and, for x  [0, 2],

eq. (3.29) shows that the f generate an innitesimal action of the loop group on the
phase space with respect to which g(x) is an ane kac-moody primary eld, and the
current j(x) transforms according to the co-adjoint action of the centrally extended loop

(3.33)

with m1 = m  1, m2 = 1  m.

we now wish to rewrite the above hamiltonian vector elds in a symbolic notation
of poisson brackets. recall that the pb of two smooth functions f1 and f2 on a nite
dimensional smooth symplectic manifold is dened by

{f1, f2} = y f2(f1) = y f1(f2) = (y f2, y f1),

(3.34)

where y fi is the hamiltonian vector eld associated with fi by the symplectic form .
one may formally apply the same formula in the innite dimensional case to the smooth
enough admissible functions. however, it is a non-trivial problem to precisely specify
the set of functions that form a closed poisson algebra. setting this question aside, it is
clear from (3.29) and (3.32) that the admissible functions of j and those of m will form
two closed poisson subalgebras that centralize each other. furthermore, we may use the
perfectly well-dened expression

{f, f} := y f(f)

(3.35)

for the pb of two admissible hamiltonians of type f in eq. (3.28) to dene the (distri-
bution valued) pb of the evaluation functions g(x) by the equality:

{f, f} := z 2

0

z 2

0

dxdytr12(cid:16)(x)  (y){g(x) , g(y)}(cid:17) ,

(3.36)

where tr12 is the (normalized) trace over v v and {g(x) , g(y)}ik,jl = {g
kl(y)}.
with these denitions, our explicit formula of the hamiltonian vector eld y f in (3.30)
is equivalent to the following quadratic exchange algebra type pb for the chiral eld
g(x):

ij(x), g

ng(x) , g(y)o =

(cid:16)g(x)  g(y)(cid:17)(cid:16)r(m) +

i sign (y  x)(cid:17)

,

0 < x, y < 2. (3.37)

proceeding in the same way with the {f, m 
kl} pb as we did with the {f, f} one, we
conclude that the right hand side of (3.31) should be interpreted as the expression of the
{g

kl} pb, and similarly for (3.32).

ij(x), m 

10

it is an open question if the admissible hamiltonians of type f, f and m 

kl together
generate a closed poisson algebra. leaving this for a future study, we here only remark
that the jacobi identity for three functions of type f is in fact equivalent to the following
equation for r(m):

[r12(m), r23(m)] + (m)t 

1 r r23(m) + cycl. perm. = 

f ,

1

(3.38)

where f is dened by

f := f 

t   t   t,

[t, t] = f 

t,

(3.39)

and the cyclic permutation is over the three tensorial factors with r23 = r(1  t  t),
1 = t   1  1 and so on. we use the components of  = t   t  given by (3.33),
t 
and the left-invariant dierential operators r that act on a function  of m by

(r)(m) :=

d
dt

(mett 

)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

.

(3.40)

eq. (3.38) can be viewed as a dynamical generalization of the classical modied yang-
baxter equation, to which it reduces if the r-matrix is a monodromy independent con-
stant. as a consequence of d

chir = 0, (3.38) is satised for any r(m) given by (3.20).

what are the poisson-lie (pl) symmetries of the chiral wznw phase space? to
make this question more denite, we equip the group g = {h} with a pl structure by
means of the sklyanin bracket

{h , h} r =

[h  h, r],

1


where r = rt  t  g  g is a constant r-matrix satisfying

[ r12, r23] + cycl. perm. = 2 f

(3.41)

(3.42)

for some constant . we then seek the conditions on r(m) and r that guarantee the
standard right action of g on mchir,

mchir  g  (g, h) 7 gh  mchir,

(3.43)

to be a pl action. this leads to the requirement

r(h1mh)  r = (h  h)1(r(m)  r)(h  h),

(3.44)

i.e., right multiplication is a pl symmetry i the exchange r-matrix r(m) is such a
solution of (3.38) that the dierence (r(m)  r) is equivariant. we can provide such
since m 7 h1m h, we here have to assume that g  g is invariant under the adjoint action of g,

or should restrict our attention to the corresponding g-action.

solutions explicitly in association with any given solution of (3.42). these solutions are
obtained by assuming the validity of the exponential parametrization for m  g:

m := e2

for   g  g

and

y := 2(ad).

(3.45)

any analytic function of y is equivariant, and it is possible to prove [21] that the r-matrix
corresponding to the linear operator

r(m) =

1
2

coth

y

  coth(y) + r

(3.46)

solves both (3.44) and (3.38) (on the domain where its power series converges).

we end this section with some remarks on the above formula. first, note that for
 = 0 (3.46) is understood as the limit of the corresponding complex analytic function.
y . if the pb (3.37) on mchir is
thus for  = 0 and r = 0 it yields r0 = 1
dened by r0, then (3.43) is a classical g-symmetry. second, if  = 1
2 then r = r, which
is the case of the constant exchange r-matrices [15]. third, it is worth stressing that for a
compact lie algebra g constant exchange r-matrices do not exist, because of the negative
sign on the right hand side of (3.38), but our formula (3.46) gives explicit solutions of
(3.38) also in this case using a purely imaginary  in (3.42). finally, we remark that in
the  = 1
2 case the construction of the 2-form  that corresponds to the r-matrix in (3.46)
is presented in [15], while in general a suitable local 2-form can be obtained by solving
(3.20) for q. further comments are contained in [21].

4 hamiltonian structures for diagonal monodromy

we now describe the hamiltonian structure that results by restricting the symplectic form

chir to a submanifold mbloch  mchir consisting of chiral wznw elds with diagonal
monodromy. the corresponding exchange algebra pb turns out to contain the classical
dynamical r-matrix (4.32).

in this section, let g be either a complex simple lie algebra or its normal real form,
and g a corresponding lie group. choose a cartan subalgebra h  g that admits the
root space decomposition

g = h  x

g,

(4.1)

and an associated basis hk  h, e  g normalized by tr (ee) = 2
this basis any a  g can be decomposed as

||2 . by using

a = a0 + ar with a0  h, ar = x

etr (ea), e :=

1

||2e.

(4.2)

fix an open domain a  h which has the properties that () / i2z for any root,
    h, and the map a   7 e  g is injective.

12

then dene mbloch  mchir by

mbloch := {b  c (r, g) | b(x + 2) = b(x)e,   a  h }.

(4.3)

let mbloch be equipped with the 2-form b

bloch, where

tr (cid:16)(b1db)(0)  d(cid:17) + b()
bloch could be obtained from 

(4.4)

chir

with an arbitrary closed 2-form b on a. clearly, b
(2.21) upon imposing the constraint m = e. now b is parametrized as

b() =

1
2

qkl
b ()tr (hkd)  tr (hld),

b = qlk
qkl
b ,

(4.5)

and a corresponding linear operator qb() on h is dened by

qb()(c) = hkqkl

b ()tr (hlc)

c  h.

(4.6)

to show that b

bloch is symplectic, it will be convenient to parametrize b  mbloch as

b(x) = h(x) exp (x) ,

 :=


2

,

where   a and h  eg. this one-to-one parametrization yields the identication

correspondingly, a vector eld x on mbloch is parametrized by

mbloch = eg  a = {(h, )}.

(4.7)

(4.8)

x = (xh, x)

x  ta  h

(4.9)

xh  th eg

with h1xh  te eg  eg. by regarding  and h as evaluation functions on mbloch, we

may write x = x() and xh(x) = x(h(x)). equivalently, x can be characterized by
its action on b(x),

b1(x)x(b(x)) = exh1(x)x(h(x))ex + xx(),

(4.10)

where the function b1(x)x(b(x)) on r is uniquely determined by its restriction to [0, 2].
naturally, the derivative x(f ) of a function f on mbloch is dened by using that any
vector is the velocity to a smooth curve. that is, if the value of the vector eld x at
b  mbloch coincides with the velocity to the curve (x, t) at t = 0, (x, 0) = b(x), then
for a dierentiable function f we have x(f )[b] = d

dtf [(x, t)]|t=0.

arguing similarly to section 3, it can be shown that b

bloch is weakly non-degenerate
on mbloch for any b. the admissible hamiltonians that possess hamiltonian vector
elds now turn out to be those functions f on mbloch whose derivative with respect to
any vector eld x exists and has the form

x(f ) = hdf, xi = tr (df x) +z 2

but not admissible, while e.g. the fourier coecients of the components of j = bb1 as

next we prove that b

bloch indeed permits to associate a unique hamiltonian vector
eld, y f , with any hamiltonian, f , subject to (4.11), (4.12). by denition, y f must
satisfy

hdf, xi = x(f ) = b

bloch(x, y f )

(4.13)

for any vector eld x. to determine y f , we rst point out that in terms of (h, )

b

bloch(h, ) =

dx tr(cid:16)(h1dh)  (h1dh)

+ 2(h1dh)  (h1dh)  2d  h1dh(cid:17) + b().

(4.14)

by equating the coecients of h1x(h) and x() on the two sides of (4.13), we obtain
the following equations for y f :

2(cid:16)h1y f (h)(cid:17)
2qb()(y f ()) +z 2

(4.15)

(4.16)

given dhf and df , we will determine b1y f (b), which is equivalent to nding h1y f (h)
and y f ().

on account of (4.10), (4.15) is in fact equivalent to

(cid:16)b1y f (b)(cid:17)

(x) =

dy ey(h1dhf )(y)ey.

(4.18)

hence the only non-trivial problem is to determine the initial value

qf := b1(0)y f (b(0)) = h1(0)y f (h(0)).

(4.19)

to this end, note from (4.10) that

y f () = eb1(2)y f (b(2))e  b1(0)y f (b(0)).

(4.20)

14

by using (4.18), the cartan part of (4.20) requires that

y f () =

(4.24)

in conclusion, we have found that the hamiltonian vector eld b1y f (b) is uniquely
determined and is explicitly given by (4.18) with b1(0)y f (b(0)) = qf in (4.23), (4.24).
in the derivation of y f we have crucially used that  is restricted to the domain a  h.
at the excluded points of h some denominators in (4.23) may vanish, whereby b
becomes singular.

bloch

the poisson bracket of two smooth enough admissible hamiltonians f1 and f2 on
mbloch is determined by the formula {f1, f2} = b
bloch(y f2, y f1) and now we extract
a classical exchange algebra from this formula. analogously to the previous section, for
this we consider functions of the form

f(h, ) = z 2

0

dx tr ((x)b(x)),

(4.25)

where b(x) is taken in a representation  of g and (x) is a smooth, matrix valued,
smearing-function in that representation. it is easy to check that f is admissible if

(k)(0) = (k)(2) = 0 k = 0, 1, 2 . . . ,

and the exterior derivative of f at (h, ) is given by

(df)(h, ) =

we here denote by hk, h k and ta, t a dual bases of h and g, respectively. the last
formula extends to a smooth 2-periodic function on the real line precisely if (4.26) is
satised. the hamiltonian vector eld y f is then found to be

(4.32)

the local formula (4.31) completely encodes the poisson brackets on mbloch since y f
can be recovered if the right hand side of (4.30) is given.

the hamiltonian vector elds associated with k := tr (hk) and with the functions

f of j (see (3.28)) can be checked to be

y k(b(x)) =

1


b(x)hk,

y f(b(x)) = (x)b(x).

(4.33)

thus j generates an action of the ane kac-moody algebra on mbloch centralized by
the action of h generated by .

the dynamical r-matrix (4.32) is antisymmetric, and is neutral in the sense that

[hk  1 + 1  hk, r()] = 0,

(4.34)

which ensures the validity of the jacobi identity for the three functions f, f, k.
moreover, it satises the equation

(4.35)

that ensures the jacobi identity for three functions of type f. this dynamical gener-
alization of the modied classical yang-baxter equation arises in other contexts as well
[25, 26, 27] and has been much studied recently [28, 29, 30]. the exchange r-matrix (4.32)
of the chiral wznw bloch waves was rst obtained in [9], where it was also shown that
it satises (4.35).

5 poisson-lie groupoids from chiral wznw

it is well-known [31] that one can associate a poisson-lie (pl) group with any anti-
symmetric solution of the modied classical yang-baxter equation. remarkably, the

16

dynamical generalizations of this equation that arise in the wznw model permit anal-
ogous interpretations in terms of pl groupoids. in particular, this means that one can
associate a pl groupoid with any chiral extension of the wznw phase space. below
we briey describe these groupoids, which are nite dimensional poisson manifolds that
encode the (non kac-moody aspects of the) innite dimensional chiral wznw pbs.

roughly speaking, a groupoid is a set, say p , endowed with a partial multiplication
that behaves similarly to a group multiplication in the cases when it can be performed
[32]). in the cases of our interest p = s  g  s = {(m f , g, m i)}, where
(see e.g.
g is a group and s is some set. the partial multiplication is dened for those triples
(m f , g, m i) and ( m f , g, m i ) for which m i = m f , and the product is

(m f , g, m i)( m f , g, m i ) := (m f , gg, m i )

for m i = m f .

(5.1)

thus the graph of the partial multiplication is the subset of

p  p  p = {(m f , g, m i)}  {( m f , g, m i )}  {( m f , g, m i)}

(5.2)

dened by the constraints

m i = m f ,

m f = m f ,

m i = m i ,

g = gg,

(5.3)

where the hatted triple encodes the components of the product. a pl groupoid [33] is
a (lie) groupoid p , which is also a poisson manifold in such a way that the graph of
the partial multiplication is a coisotropic submanifold of p  p  p , where p  denotes
the manifold p endowed with the opposite of the pb on p . to put it dierently, the
constraints that dene the graph are rst class. (for p = s  g  s, this denition
reduces to that of a pl group if s consists of a single point.)

let us rst recall the denition of the pl groupoids that are related to the poisson
structures on mbloch. in a more general context, these groupoids have been introduced in
[28]. they are of the form above, where s is a domain in the dual of a cartan subalgebra
h of a simple lie group g. we now identify h with h and take the domain to be a  h
considered in section 4. for notational convenience, we further identify s with exp(a) 
exp(h), and denote the components of the corresponding triples as m i = exp(i) and
m f = exp(f ) for f , i  a. using the standard tensorial notation and a basis hi of
h, we then dene a poisson structure on pbloch := a  g  a = {(f , g, i)} as follows:

{g1, g2}pbloch = g1g2 r(i)  r(f )g1g2

{g, i

i }pbloch = ghi

{g, f

i }pbloch = hig

{i

i , i

j }pbloch = {f

i , f

j }pbloch = {i

i , f

j }pbloch = 0,

(5.4)

17

where  is a constant included for comparison purposes and i(f )
= tr (hii(f )). equa-
tions (4.34) and (4.35) for r() are sucient for the jacobi identities of this pb to
be satised [28]. one can also check that the graph of the partial multiplication is
coisotropic.

i

in some sense, the pbs (5.4) on pbloch correspond to the pbs on the chiral wznw
phase space mbloch. motivated by this, we now dene a pl groupoid which is related
to an arbitrary chiral extension of the wznw phase space with generic monodromy. in
this case, using an open domain g  g, we take p to be

p = g  g  g,

(5.5)

and postulate on it a pb { , }p as follows:

{g1, g2}p = g1g2r(m i )  r(m f )g1g2

{g1, m i

2 }p = g1m i
2

(m i )

{g1, m f

2 }p = m f
2

(m f )g1

{m i

2 }p = m i

(m i )

{m f

1 , m f

2 }p = m f

1 m f
2

{m i

1 , m f

2 }p = 0.

(m f )

(5.6)

it is easy to verify that a pb given by the ansatz (5.6) always yields a pl groupoid,
since the constraints in (5.3) are rst class for any choice of the g  g valued structure
functions r, ,  on g. of course, the structure functions must satisfy a system of
equations for the ansatz (5.6) to dene a pb. these equations are spelled out in [21]. the
important point is that, in fact, a sucient condition for the jacobi identity is obtained
by assuming that (m) and (m) are given by (3.33) in terms of an antisymmetric
solution r(m) of (3.38).

we have extracted a pl groupoid from any chiral extension of the wznw phase space
with generic monodromy by taking the triple r, ,  that arises in the wznw model
to be the structure functions of { , }p . it should be noticed that if r is non-dynamical,
then the pl groupoid p carries the same information as the group g endowed with the
corresponding sklyanin bracket. among our pl groupoids there are also those special
cases for which (r  r) satises the equivariance condition (3.44) in relation with an
arbitrary constant r-matrix r subject to (3.42). in these cases, it is possible to dene
commuting left and right pl actions of the group g (endowed with the pb (3.41)) on
p , reecting the corresponding pl symmetry (3.43) on the chiral wznw phase space.

we believe that it would be interesting to study the above introduced pl groupoids
further, for example to understand their quantization and relate them to the quantized
(chiral) wznw conformal eld theory.
