given a symmetry group acting on a principal bre bundle, sym-
metric states of the quantum theory of a dieomorphism invariant
theory of connections on this bre bundle are dened. these symmet-
ric states, equipped with a scalar product derived from the ashtekar-
lewandowski measure for loop quantum gravity, form a hilbert space
of their own. restriction to this hilbert space yields a quantum sym-
metry reduction procedure in the framework of spin network states
the structure of which is analyzed in detail.

three illustrating examples are discussed: reduction of 3 + 1 to
2 + 1 dimensional quantum gravity, spherically symmetric quantum
electromagnetism and spherically symmetric quantum gravity.

1 introduction

during the last years there have been many very active and partially success-
ful attempts to quantize gravitational systems: one very ambitious approach
is string theory (see, e.g. ref. [1]) which tries to cover the quantum theory
of all interactions at once. another one is loop quantum gravity (see the
reviews [2]) which uses a (non-perturbative) canonical framework (cauchy
surfaces, canonical coordinates and momenta, constraints etc.) for dieomor-
phism invariant gravity formulated in terms of connection variables, without
or with couplings to matter.

among its achievements loop quantum gravity counts the following ones:
the uncovering of a discrete structure of space [3, 4, 5, 6], a derivation
of the bekenstein-hawking formula for the black hole entropy in terms of
microscopic degrees of freedom [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and a regularization and
partial solution of the constraints of general relativity [12, 13, 14, 15]. all
these results rely heavily on the fundamental assumption that holonomies
(wilson loops) of the su(2)-gauge connection of general relativity in the
ashtekar formulation with real connections [16, 17] become densely dened
operators in the quantum theory.

in order to test the basic assumptions of that approach and in order to
check whether the theory can have the correct classical limit, mini- and midi-
superspace models [18] are very appropriate because their (strongly) reduced
number of degrees of freedom make them more transparent and sometimes
even solvable.

these models are usually obtained by a classical symmetry reduction
of the full theory and they are selected in order to facilitate quantization
while keeping some of the basic problems faced in the quantization of general
relativity. an example is the reduction of the 3 + 1 dimensional theory
to a 2 + 1 dimensional one. here a simplication occurs because 2 + 1
dimensional gravity has only nitely many physical degrees of freedom and
it is exactly soluble [19]. this model has already been investigated in the
loop quantization approach [20] starting from a classical 2 + 1 dimensional
theory of gravity in terms of ashtekar variables.

our strategy will be dierent: we want to isolate symmetric states of the
already loop quantized 3 + 1 dimensional full theory. these states have to be
exactly symmetric, not only symmetric at large distances compared to the
planck scale. constraining the space of physical states to these symmetric
ones amounts to a quantum symmetry reduction.

1

because the solutions to all the constraints of loop quantum gravity are
not known we will carry out this symmetry reduction procedure on an aux-
iliary hilbert space. therefore we will have to regularize and to solve the
reduced constraints on our spaces of symmetric states. as always with re-
duced models, the hope is that this regularization and the search for solutions
can be done with more ease. at the same time one hopes that the model
under consideration can lead to new insights in the quantization of the full
theory.

our main motive for the analysis of the present paper has its origin in
our interest in the reduction to spherical symmetry. the classically reduced
schwarzschild system has been quantized using ashtekar variables (but not
using loop quantization techniques) in refs. [21, 22]. a corresponding analy-
sis has been performed for the reissner-nordstrm model [23]. these models
are of physical interest because they are related to vacuum black holes. simi-
lar to 2 + 1 dimensional gravity they have only nitely many physical degrees
of freedom, and it is an interesting question how this reduction of innitely
many degrees of freedom of the full theory takes place in a loop quantization
using spin network states.

another motivation is to possibly nd a way in order to calculate the
degeneracy of energy levels. the levels are not degenerate in the quantization
of the classically reduced theory; however, this approach makes use only of
smooth elds whereas loop quantum gravity relates the black hole entropy
to distributional congurations (generalized functions). also, non-spherical
uctuations should not be ignored. the degeneracy plays a crucial role in the
calculation [24, 25] of black hole entropy using a canonical partition function
approach. the entropy obtained in this way is proportional to the horizon
area, but the constant of proportionality is only known to be o(1), so that a
quantitative comparison with the semiclassical a/4 -law is not immediate. a
similar problem arises in the loop quantum gravity calculation [11] because
of the so-called immirzi parameter [26]. a comparison of the entropy of the
full theory with that of the spherically symmetric one may shed some light
on the origin of the degeneracies because degenerate states of the symmetric
model may become non-degenerate for the non-symmetic one.

another possible application is to study cosmological models within loop

quantum gravity [27].

in order to attack these physical questions we have to dene symmetric
states in the hilbert space of loop quantum gravity and have to determine
their properties. this will be done in the present paper in a more general

2

setting: we will investigate the case of a lie symmetry group s acting on a
principal bre bundle with a compact lie structure group g.

before going to this general case let us dwell briey on spherically sym-
metric quantum gravity: the states of the (non-spherically symmetric) full
theory are given in terms of a polymer-like structure called spin network,
lying in the spacelike section of space-time used to carry out a canonical
quantization. we now have to face the problem how to establish a symme-
try of a discrete structure under a continuous symmetry group. a possible
approach is suggested by the well-known solution of the dieomorphism con-
straint using group averaging methods [12]. however, this cannot lead to
the desired result here: we would have to average not only over rotated
subgraphs of the graph underlying a given spin network which is to be aver-
aged, but it would be necessary to average over all rotations of an edge while
keeping the other edges xed because these give the same holonomy when
evaluated in an invariant connection. otherwise the holonomy of an edge
as a multiplication operator would not commute with rotations. therefore
some averaging of parts of a given graph has to be done, which, however,
runs into problems when gauge invariance has to be imposed. in some sense
the rotation group is too rigid as compared to the dieomorphism group: it
acts only simply transitively on its orbits, whereas the dieomorphism group
acts k-transitively for any k  n, i.e. any two given sets of k dierent points
can be mapped one onto another by a single dieomorphism.
a lesson, however, can nevertheless be drawn from group averaging: sym-
metric states have to be distributions (generalized functions) on the function
space over the quantum conguration space. this can be understood from
the following intuitive picture: constraining the support of a spin network
function to only symmetric connections yields a singular distribution. this
observation will guide us in our denition of symmetric states.

in order to achieve this we will use the theory of invariant connections on
symmetric principal bre bundles [28, 29, 30]. the essential properties and
results will be recalled in the next section, together with some mathemati-
cal techniques of loop quantization. that section will also serve to x our
notation.

section 3 deals with the denition of symmetric states and the analysis
of their properties; it contains entirely new material. our main result is
theorem 3.2, by means of which we can identify spaces of symmetric states
with certain spin network spaces.

in section 4 we will give some examples: quantum symmetry reduction

3

to 2 + 1 dimensional gravity and spherically symmetric electromagnetism
as well as gravitation. these examples are intended to illustrate the kine-
matical framework of the symmetry reduction proposed here. solving the
corresponding constraints is another task.

as to 2 + 1 dimensional gravity we shall show how our approach leads to
the same results as that of thiemann [20]. spherically symmetric dieomor-
phism invariant electromagnetism will be treated for a vanishing gravitational
eld only. it is nevertheless an interesting example for the symmetry reduc-
tion of a dieomorphism invariant system, and it illustrates the reduction of
degrees of freedom to nitely many ones and also the classifying role of the
magnetic charge.

the discussion of spherically symmetric gravity is mainly restricted to
kinematical aspects: the symmetry reduction is implemented, the gau con-
straint solved in the context of the appropriate spin networks and the solution
of the dieomorphism constraint by group averaging indicated. the problem
of dealing with the more dicult hamiltonian constraint (denition as a well-
dened operator on spin-network states and the solution of the constraint)
will be discussed elsewhere [31].

an interesting application of our results to the spectrum of the area oper-
ator acting in the spherically symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity will
be published in a separate note [32].

2 preparations

in this section we will recall some facts concerning loop quantization tech-
niques and the theory of invariant connections on symmetric principal bre
bundles which will be used in the following sections.

2.1 spin networks with higgs field vertices

let g be a compact lie group,  an analytic manifold and p (, g, ) a
principal bre bundle over the base manifold  with structure group g. the
ane space of connections on this bre bundle will be denoted as a, and the
(local) gauge group as g. investigating invariant connections will lead us to
the use of higgs elds, which are sections of the adjoint bundle of p (the
associated vector bundle employing the adjoint representation). the space
of all smooth higgs elds will be called u. these three function spaces will

4

have to be extended in the course of quantization. their treatment is given
in ref. [12] for a and g, and in ref. [33] for u.
in the following we will
combine these procedures.

let t be the parallel transport algebra generated by elements of the
matrix-valued parallel transporters associated with a fundamental represen-
tation of g along all piecewise analytic paths in , subject to appropriate
relations ensuring the correct matrix multiplication under composition of
paths and taking care of the group properties of g (incorporating mandel-
stam identities).

similarly, let p be the point holonomy algebra generated by elements
of matrices, including the identity, in a fundamental representation of g of
point holonomies. according to ref. [33] a point holonomy is a function on
the space u of classical higgs elds obtained by exponentiating the value of
a higgs eld at a given point.
the multiplication within the algebras is multiplication of c-valued func-
tions on a and u, respectively. let t and p be their completions in the
sup norm. these two algebras are abelian c -algebras with identity. we
can build the product algebra t  p which is the completed tensor product
space of the underlying vector spaces with pointwise multiplication. this,
too, is an abelian c -algebra with identity and we can use gelfand-neumark
theory (see, e.g. refs. [34]) to obtain the following isometry of c -algebras:

t  p = c(a)  c(u) = c(a  u).

(1)

a and u are the gelfand spectra of the respective algebras consisting of all
continuous -homomorphisms of the algebras to c. the isometry is given by
the gelfand transform :t  c(a) dened below, and similarly for u. a
and u are extensions of the spaces a and u which are densely embedded in
the gelfand topology. this topology is uniquely dened by the following two
conditions: a be compact and t :a  c, a 7 t (a) = a(t ) be continuous
for all t  t . the compact hausdor space a  u will serve as quantum
conguration space.
there is, however, an alternative construction of these spaces which is
better suited for calculations. here the extensions are constructed as certain
projective limit spaces. the partially ordered directed set used to dene
these limits is the set  of all piecewise analytic graphs  in . the projective
families (a, p ) and (g, p ) = (u, p ) can be found in refs. [35, 12].
a is the space of all functions which assign elements of the group g to the

5

edges of , and which obey certain relations ensuring the correct behavior
under inversion and composition of edges. the elements of g and u assign
group elements to the vertices of . the projections p :a   a,   
restrict the domain of denition of the connections in a  to the edges of
, and similarly for g and u. g acts on both a and u by usual gauge
transformations. the projective families dene the projective limits a, g and
u, where now g acts on a and u . these projective limit spaces are identical
to the gelfand spectra constructed above, and their topology induced from
the tychonov topology is equivalent to the gelfand topology. this can be
seen from the fact that a is  as the projective limit of compact spaces 
compact, and that the maps t are continuous. in the proof of theorem 3.1
we will make use of the equivalence of gelfand and tychonov topologies.

our quantum conguration space now is the space au and the auxiliary
hilbert space will consist of functions on this space. an important class of
such functions is that of cylindrical functions which depend on the connection
and higgs eld only via a nite number of edges and vertices in . a function
f , cylindrical with respect to the underlying graph , can be written as

f (a, u) = f(a(e1), . . . , a(en), u(v1), . . . , u(vm))

(2)

where e1, . . . , en are the edges of , and v1, . . . , vm its vertices. the functions
f representing a cylindrical function f have to obey certain consistency
conditions. the auxiliary hilbert space is l2(a  u, dal) obtained from
the space of cylindrical functions by completion with respect to the ashtekar-
lewandowski measure dal, which is, on a cylindrical subspace, the nite
product of haar measure on g for each edge and vertex of the respective
graph .

an orthogonal basis is given by the set of spin network functions with
higgs eld vertices. these are cylindrical functions given by a graph  to-
gether with a labeling j of its edges, and labelings j, j of its vertices with
equivalence classes of irreducible representations of g, and a third labeling
c of the vertices with certain intertwining operators. given a vertex v, cv
is given by an intertwining operator from the tensor product of the rep-
resentations je labeling incoming edges e and the representation j
v to the
tensor product of the representations je labeling outgoing edges and the rep-
resentations j
v . the value of a spin network function on an element
(a, u)  au is found by taking for each edge e   the element a(e) in the
representation je and for each vertex v   the element u(v) in the represen-
tation j
v, and then contracting these matrices according to the intertwining

v and j

6

operators in the vertices. the resulting function will transform according
to the representation j
in particular, the spin network
function will be gauge invariant if all the representations j

v in each vertex v.

v are trivial.

2.2

invariant connections on
symmetric principal fibre bundles

it is well known [28, 29, 30] that an invariant connection on a manifold 
can be decomposed into a reduced connection of a reduced gauge group on
a submanifold b   plus some scalar elds on b acted on by a group ac-
tion determined by the symmetry reduction (a representation of the reduced
structure group). the multiplet of scalar elds will be called higgs eld
in the following. it arises because in general an invariant connection is not
manifestly invariant, but only invariant up to gauge transformations.

e.g. the authors of [36, 37] make an ansatz for a spherically symmetric
connection using the fact that a symmetry transformation can be compen-
sated by a gauge transformation if the lie algebra of the structure group
contains a su(2) subalgebra.

in this paper we will use a more general and more systematic approach
which yields a complete classication of invariant connections on symmetric
principal bre bundles. it can be found in refs. [28, 29, 30], and its main
elements will be recalled in the present subsection. the method has the
following advantages:

 the structure of the reduction of the gauge group and the appearance

of higgs elds becomes clearer.

 all partial gauge xings (selections of a certain homomorphism   []
dened below) can be treated on the same footing (and eventually be
relaxed), whereas the ansatz of refs. [36, 37] amounts to selecting one
special , i.e. a partial gauge xing.

 a possible topological charge given by gauge inequivalent actions of
the symmetry group in the bres can be taken into account. this
is excluded by the ansatz of [36, 37] from the outset by using trivial
bundles and a xed action of the symmetry group on the bundle only.

whereas the rst two points will be essential for constructing symmetry
reductions in the spin network context (section 3), the last point is needed
for generality and allows to describe e.g. a magnetic charge.

7

now let s < aut (p ) be a lie symmetry subgroup of bundle automor-
phisms acting on the principal bre bundle p (, g, ) dened above. using
the projection : p   we get a symmetry operation of s on . for sim-
plicity we will assume that all orbits of s are of the same type; if necessary we
will have to decompose the base manifold in several orbit bundles (f )  ,
where f = sx is the isotropy subgroup of s consisting of elements xing a
point x of the orbit bundle (f ). this amounts to a special treatment of
possible symmetry axes or centers, respectively.

by restricting ourselves to one xed orbit bundle we x an isotropy sub-
group f  s and we require that the action of s on  is such that the
orbits are given by s(x) = s/f for all x  . this will be the case if s is
compact. moreover, we have to assume that the coset space s/f is reduc-
tive [28], i.e. ls can be decomposed as a direct sum ls = lf  lf with
ad f (lf)  lf. if s is semisimple, lf is the orthogonal complement
of lf with respect to the cartan-killing metric on ls. the base manifold
can then be decomposed as  = /s  s/f where /s = b   is the base
manifold of the orbit bundle and it can be realized as a submanifold b of 
via a section in this bundle.

given a point x  , the action of the isotropy subgroup f yields a map
f : 1(x)  1(x) of the bre over x commuting with the right action of
the bundle. to each point p  1(x) we can assign a group homomorphism
p: f  g dened by f (p) =: p  p(f ) for all f  f . for a dierent point
p = p  g in the same bre we get, using commutativity of the action of s <
aut (p ) with right multiplication of g on p , the conjugated homomorphism
p = ad g1  p. this construction yields a map : p  f  g, (p, f ) 7
p(f ) obeying the relation pg = ad g1  p.
given a xed homomorphism : f  g, we can build the principal bre
subbundle
(3)

q(b, z, q) := {p  p|b : p = }

over the base manifold b the structure group of which is the centralizer
z := zg((f )) of (f ) in g. p|b is the restricted bre bundle over b. a
conjugated homomorphism  = ad g1   will lead to an isomorphic bre
bundle.
the structure elements [] and q classify symmetric principal bre bun-

dles according to the following theorem [30]:

theorem 2.1 a s-symmetric principal bre bundle p (, g, ) with the iso-
tropy subgroup f  s of the action of s on  is uniquely characterized by

8

a conjugacy class [] of homomorphisms : f  g together with a reduced
bundle q(/s, zg((f )), q).

given two groups f and g we can make use of the relation [40]

hom (f, g)/ad = hom (f, t (g))/w (g)

(4)

in order to determine all conjugacy classes of homomorphisms : f  g.
here t (g) is a standard maximal torus and w (g) the weyl group of g.
now let  be a s-invariant connection on the bundle p classied by
([], q). the connection  induces a connection  on the reduced bundle
q. because of the s-invariance of  the reduced connection  is a one-
form on q with values in the lie algebra of the reduced structure group.
furthermore, by using  we can construct the linear map p:ls  lg, x 7
p( x) for any p  p . here x is the vector eld on p given by x(f ) :=
d(exp(tx)f )/dt|t=0 for any x  ls and f  c 1(p, r). for x  lf the
vector eld x is a vertical vector eld, and we have p(x) = dp(x) where
d:lf  lg is the derivative of the homomorphism dened above. this
component of  is therefore already given by the classifying structure of the
principal bre bundle. using a suitable gauge,  can be held constant along
b. the remaining components p|lf yield information about the invariant
connection . they are subject to the condition

p(ad f (x)) = ad p(f )(p(x))

for f  f, x  ls

(5)

which follows from the transformation of  under the adjoint representation
and which provides a set of equations which determine the higgs eld.

keeping only the information characterizing  we have, besides , the
higgs eld : q  lglf 
 determined by p|lf. the reduced connection
and the higgs eld suce to characterize an invariant connection. this is
the assertion of the following theorem [30]:

theorem 2.2 (generalized wang theorem) let p (, g) be a s-sym-
metric principal bre bundle classied by ([], q) according to theorem 2.1
and let  be a s-invariant connection on p .

then the connection  is uniquely classied by the reduced connection 

on q and the higgs eld : q  lf  lg obeying eq. (5).

in general,  will transform under some representation of the reduced
structure group z: the higgs eld lies in the subspace of lg determined

9

by eq. (5). it forms a representation space of all group elements of g (which
act on ) whose action preserves the higgs subspace. these are precisely
elements of the reduced group by denition.

the connection  can be reconstructed from its classifying structure as

follows: according to the decomposition  = b  s/f we have  =  +
s/f , where s/f is given by   m c in a gauge depending on the (local)
embedding : s/f  s. here m c is the maurer-cartan form on s. for
example, in the generic case (not in a symmetry center) of spherical symmetry
we have s = su(2), f = u(1) = exph3i (hi denotes the linear span), and
the connection form can be gauged to be

as/f = ((2) sin  + (3) cos )d + (1)d.

(6)

here (, ) are coordinates on s/f = s2. the j build a basis of ls and
are given by j :=  i
2 j, j being the pauli matrices. (3) is given by d,
whereas (1,2) are the higgs eld components.

eq. (6) contains as special cases the invariant connections found in ref.
[37]. these are gauge equivalent by gauge transformations depending on the
angular coordinates (, ), i. e., they correspond to homomorphisms  which
are not constant on the orbits of the symmetry group.

3 symmetric states

before describing the rather abstract construction of symmetric spin network
states we will present the general idea in a rst subsection. the following
subsections deal with the construction of symmetric states as generalized
states of the unreduced theory and proofs of some of their properties.

3.1 principal idea

the principal idea of our construction [38] described in this section is to
make use of the reconstruction of an invariant connection from its classifying
structure, namely by means of the pull back of a function on the space of
connections on  to a function on the space of connections plus higgs elds
on the reduced manifold b which in the context of analytic spin networks
will be assumed to be an analytic submanifold of .

but some complications arise because of the classical partial gauge xing
by selecting a special homomorphism   []. the reduced gauge group and

10

the space of higgs elds depend on this selection. moreover, the higgs eld
does in general not transform under the adjoint representation of the reduced
structure group, which would be helpful in spin network quantization.
in
contrast, before imposing the constraint (5) it transforms in general under
the adjoint representation of the unreduced structure group. such a higgs
eld can easily be implemented in the spin network context using the rules
recalled in subsection 2.1.

the interrelation of partial gauge xings and reductions of the gauge
group makes it possible to eliminate partial gauge xings by using the full
gauge group on the reduced manifold. this is the essence of denition 3.3
below.

3.2 construction

let us now dene the notion of symmetric states. the hilbert space under
consideration is the auxiliary hilbert space h := l2(a, dal) on which the
constraints have to be solved. because of the singular character of symmetric
states mentioned in the introduction we will have to use the rigged hilbert
space   h  
, where  denotes the space of cylindrical functions
on the space a of connections over  and 
denition 3.1 (symmetric states) let p be a s-symmetric principal -
bre bundle, classied by ([], q).

 its topological dual.

a []-symmetric state is a distribution   

 on  whose support con-
tains only connections that are invariant under the s-action on p classied
by [].

although denition 3.1 catches the intuitive notion of a symmetric state,
it is not well suited for a calculus. we have to develop some tools in analogy
to the spin network calculus. this will be done in the remaining part of this
section by combining techniques collected in the last section. application of
these techniques will lead to several spaces of connections which are dened
in

denition 3.2 let p (, g) be a principal bre bundle acted on by a sym-
metry group s according to the classication ([], q), where q is the reduced
bundle over the manifold b  .
a and g are the space of generalized connections on p and the ex-
tended local gauge group, respectively. ab  u b is the space of generalized

11

for any   [], (a  u)

g-connections and higgs elds in the adjoint representation of g over b.
gb is the extended local gauge group of generalized g-gauge transformations
over b.
is dened to be the subset of ab  u b
subject to the following constraints: the generalized connections take values
in the structure group z of the reduced bundle q, and the generalized higgs
elds take values in the submanifold of g obtained by exponentiating the
linear solution space of eq. (5). here we have to use a separate higgs eld
component for every element of a basis of lf.
remark: the space ab  u b is independent of the reduction of the struc-
ture group and the constraints (5) on the higgs eld. these aect only the
denition of (a  u)
which depends explicitly on the homomorphism ,
not only on its conjugacy class. therefore, for any   [] we have a separate
space of connections and higgs elds because already the reduced structure
group may depend on . we can eliminate this redundancy by factoring
out the gauge group, but this has to be done with care due to the classical
reduction of the gauge group.

in order to achieve our goal, we will make use of the classifying structure
(, ) of a []-invariant connection . below theorem 2.2, we described the
reconstruction of  from its classifying structure. this reconstruction denes
a continuous map

which can be continued uniquely to a continuous map

r()
 : (a  u)

 a

r()
 : (a  u)

 a.

as the notation indicates, this map depends not only on the homomorphism
  [], but also on the embedding : s/f  s.
because a dierent  would reconstruct a gauge equivalent connection
form, the dependence on  can be eliminated by factoring out the gauge
group on p . this leads us to the family of maps
 a/g.

r: (a  u)

the dependence on  (as opposed to []) is pure gauge:  can be changed
arbitrarily in its conjugacy class [] by applying a global transformation with
a g  g, g 6 z. this shows that the domains of denition of all the maps
r are in fact dierent, but that they are related by gauge transformations.
this observation motivates the following

(7)

12

denition 3.3 let [] be a conjugacy class of homomorphisms.

then (au /g)[] is the subset of abu b/gb consisting of all g b-gauge
equivalence classes containing a representative which lies in some (a u)
,
  [].
remark: because we allow here for any local gauge transformation, we relax
the condition that  be constant on b, which is imposed in the classical
symmetry reduction procedure.

g-equivariance of r, which means that for any gb-gauge transformation
gb there is a g -gauge transformation g with r  gb = g  r, now allows
to factor out gauge transformations in the domains of denition of the maps
r. thereby we obtain a further map

r[]: (a  u/g)[]  a/g

(8)

which depends only on the conjugacy class [].

we then have the

lemma 3.1 the subset of generalized gauge invariant, []-invariant con-
nections in a/g is given by im (r[]), the image of the map r[].
proof: this is clear from the construction of r[].

recall that our goal is to develop a calculus on the manifold of []-
invariant connections. given a continuous function on this manifold, we
can pull it back via r[] and so obtain a continuous function on (au /g)[].
if this function can be continued to a function on ab u b, we will have the
desired calculus on that space at our disposal. an extension can indeed be
achieved by expanding the pulled back function in the spin network basis of
c(ab  u b), the space of continuous functions on the space of connections
and higgs elds over b.
in order to achieve uniqueness of this expansion we have to truncate the

spin network basis b of c(ab  u b) if necessary in such a way that

b := {t|(au)[]}t b

(9)

is a set of independent functions. e.g. we have to use only spin network
states with trivial higgs vertices if eq. (5) does not allow any nonvanishing
higgs eld.

13

this extension procedure following the pull back with r[] nally yields

the map

r
[]: c(a/g)  c(ab  u b/gb)

(10)

which will provide the key element in our investigation of symmetric states.
however, a function pulled back in such a way is quite singular on the
space ab  u b/gb. even if we constrain the domain of denition of r
[] to
, the space of cylindrical functions, the pull back may in general not lead
to a cylindrical or al-integrable function on ab  u b/gb: the holonomy
to a generic edge depends on all components of an unreduced connection in
all its points, which leads to a continuous distribution of higgs vertices. we,
therefore, have again to use a rigged hilbert space, this time

b  hb  
b.

(11)

here, b is the space of cylindrical functions on abu b/gb, 
b its topolog-
ical dual, and hb := l2(ab  u b/gb, dal) (again modulo relations which
solve the higgs constraint (5), and which will be dealt with in more detail
elsewhere; examples can be found in the last section).

the restriction of r

[] to  can now be interpreted as an antilinear map

[]:   
b,

reminiscent of a group averaging map: the pull back of a cylindrical function
f   is interpreted as a distribution on b according to (g  b)

[](f )(g) := zab u b /gb

dal r

[]f g.

(12)

in a similar way, we can interpret a cylindrical function g  b as a

distribution on  according to

[](g)(f ) := zab u b /gb

dal g r

[]f

(13)

where []: b  

 is the antilinear map given by this interpretation.

between the maps [], [] connecting the two gelfand triples.

in general (see the remarks preceding eq. (11)) []() is not contained
in b, and we cannot compose [] and [] to obtain a map from  to 
.
this is the main dierence to a group averaging map, which is aimed to solve a
gauge constraint. only in very special situations can the symmetry reduction
be formulated analogous to a group averaging (subsection 4.2 and [39]). but
in general we have the two maps [], which restricts an unsymmetric state
to its symmetric part, and [], which identies symmetric states with spin
network states over b thereby equipping the space of symmetric states with
a calculus.

3.3 properties of the symmetric states

the goal of this subsection is to prove that the construction of the previous
subsection yields all symmetric states. in order to achieve this we need some
preparations.

lemma 3.2 let g be a compact topological group which is hausdor and h
be a subgroup of g. the centralizer zg(h) := {g  g : gh = hg for all h 
h} is a compact subgroup of g.
proof:

it is well known that zg(h) is a subgroup [40]. it can be written as

zg(h) = \hh

gh

15

where gh is the isotropy subgroup of h  h under the adjoint action gg 
g, (g, h) 7 ghg1 of g on itself. because the intersection of an arbitrary set
of closed sets is closed, it suces to prove that all isotropy subgroups gh are
closed.

the action of g on itself leads, restricted to a xed element h  g, to
the continuous map ch: g  g, g 7 ghg1. gh = c1
h (h) is the preimage
of a closed set (because g is hausdor) under a continuous map, and hence
closed. now, zg(h) is a closed subset of a compact group and therefore
compact.

lemma 3.3 let p be a s-symmetric principal bre bundle and [] be a
conjugacy class of homomorphisms classifying p together with the reduced
bundle q.

the set of generalized gauge invariant []-invariant connections on p is

closed in a/g.
proof: according to lemma 3.1 we have to show that the image of r
 which is identical to the image of r[]  is closed.

we will start by showing that the domain of denition of r, i. e. (a 
u), is compact. the elements of this space take values in a compact set,
because we know in the rst place from lemma 3.2 that z is compact. the
generalized higgs elds take values in a compact manifold, too. such a higgs
eld has several components given by the linear map :lf  lg subject
to the linear eq. (5). therefore, the values of  lie in a linear subspace of lg,
and exponentiating yields generalized higgs elds taking values in a compact
submanifold of g.

(au ) can be constructed as a projective limit along the lines described
in subsection 2.1. the projective family consists of compact spaces, because
the maps involved assign elements of compact spaces to a nite number of
edges and vertices of graphs. therefore, the projective limit is compact in
its induced tychonov topology which is equivalent to the induced topology
as a subset of ab  u b.
now, as stated in subsection 2.1, the tychonov topology is equivalent
to the gelfand topology. but r is continuous in the gelfand topology
(being by construction a continuation of a continuous function on the dense
subspace (au)), and so the image of r is compact. as a compact subset
of a hausdor space it is closed.

16

theorem 3.1 let [] be a conjugacy class of homomorphisms.

the image of [] contains only []-symmetric states.

proof: according to denition 3.1 we have to prove that the support of
a distribution in the image of [] contains only []-invariant connections.
this amounts to showing that for any non-invariant generalized connection
a  (a/g)\im (r[]) there is a neighborhood u of a so that the restriction
of any distribution   im ([]) to u is the zero distribution.
because of lemma 3.3 a has a neighborhood which is entirely contained
in (a/g)\im (r[]). if we restrict  to this neighborhood, it will be the
zero distribution due to its very denition in eq. (13): the pull back with
r[] of any function supported on the neighborhood of a will be zero.

this theorem provides us with a rich class of []-symmetric states. even
better, we have a calculus on this class of states, because they are identied
by eq. (13) with the space b of cylindrical functions. elements of 
b can
be regarded as generalized symmetric states.

the following lemma states that we have found enough symmetric states.

lemma 3.4 let [] be a conjugacy class of homomorphisms.

there is no cylindrical function f   that is non-trivial on im (r[]) and
annihilated by all distributions in [](b). in particular, the space [](b)
separates the elements of  that dier when restricted to []-invariant con-
nections.

proof: let   
 be a symmetric state. if f, g   are two cylindrical
functions that are identical when restricted to []-invariant connections, then
(f ) = (g). let us, therefore, introduce the following equivalence relation
which respects the algebraic and topological structure of . two cylindrical
functions f  g are equivalent if and only if r
[]g. symmetric states
can be seen as functions on the space of equivalence classes, and we need to
show that, if [f ] 6= [g], there is a distribution   [](b) with (f ) 6= (g).
[]f  c(ab  u b/gb) where [f ] is not
trivial. as noted earlier, it may not be cylindrical, not even integrable.
it will correspond to a symmetric state obeying
but if it is cylindrical,
[](r
if it is not, we can approximate it by a sequence of
cylindrical functions which is obtained by projecting it onto cylindrical sub-
spaces, cylindrical with respect to graphs of an increasing net constructed

let us look now at the function r

[]f = r

[]f )(f ) 6= 0.

17

[]f will lie in 

as follows: if r
b, but not in b, then it will be a countably
innite sum of terms, each being cylindrical with respect to a nite graph,
the union of all these graphs being an innite graph. the projections will
be obtained by truncating to a nite number of these graphs, their number
tending to innity in the sequence mentioned. (this is reminiscent of the
well known approximating sequences of the -distribution or, more generally,
of an approximate identity in an algebra without identity.) all the functions
fi in the sequence will fulll [](fi)(f ) 6= 0 proving our assertion.
separation now follows from linearity, but can also be proved directly:
we pick a representative for each equivalence class of cylindrical functions
in , and for each representative f the cylindrical function r
[]f , if it lies
already in b, or else an appropriate element of the sequence approximating
r
[]f . the term appropriate means, that any linear relation between the
chosen functions reects a linear relation between equivalence classes. an
appropriate selection can always be done, because the sequences approximate
the functions r
[]f which are dierent for dierent classes. thereby, we obtain
a class of distributions separating the equivalence classes.

the results of this lemma can be interpreted as (over-)completeness of
the set [](b) of generalized functions on {f|im (r[]) : f  } in the sense
that [](g)(f ) = 0 for all g  b implies f|im (r[]) = 0. together with
theorem 3.1 this can be summarized in

theorem 3.2 (quantum symmetry reduction) let p be a s-symmet-
ric principal bre bundle classied by ([], q), q being the reduced bundle over
b.

the space of []-symmetric states on a/g can, by means of the map-
ping [], be identied with the space b of cylindrical functions on ab 
u b/gb.
proof: let symm := /  be the space of functions on the space im (r[])
of generalized gauge invariant and []-invariant connections, and 
symm its
topological dual. due to the denition in lemma 3.4 of , 
symm can be
identied with the space of []-symmetric states as dened in denition 3.1.
according to lemma 3.4, [](b) is in separating duality with symm.
this implies that [](b) is dense in 
symm in the weak topology [41, chap-
ter ii, 6.2, corollary 4], and, therefore, in the space of []-symmetric states.
(note, however, that the topology on b induced from the weak topology by

18

the continuous map [] is coarser than the topology in which b is completed
to hb.)
in conclusion, the map [] is injective (by construction of b  where
the higgs constraint (5) is assumed to be solved  and by the construction
of []), and has a dense image in the space of []-symmetric states.

this theorem allows us to trade the space of symmetric states according
to denition 3.1, which is not well suited for establishing a calculus, for
the space b. this space and the given calculus thereon are only a bit more
dicult to deal with than the space  of all states of the full theory, because
we may have to use spin networks with higgs eld vertices.

the gau constraint is solved by using gauge invariant functions, i.e.
cylindrical functions on ab u b/gb. the dieomorphism constraint can be
solved by group averaging. after imposing s-symmetry there are only those
dieomorphisms to average that respect this symmetry. these are precisely
the dieomorphisms of b, and the constraint can be solved by averaging over
the dieomorphism group of b acting on b.

we conclude this section with some remarks:

 we describe symmetric states by spin networks of the group g, not
those of z, as might have been expected from the classical reduction.
on the one hand, we are forced to do that because the higgs eld
transforms in general according to the adjoint representation of g, not
z. on the other hand, the reduced structure group z has its origin
in a partial gauge xing imposed by xing . our quantum symmetry
reduced theory does not make use of such a partial gauge xing. instead
we will have to enforce gauge invariance under the full group g.

 in quantizing classical expressions we have nevertheless to start from
those which might be invariant only under the reduced gauge group.
the rst step of quantization will yield an operator acting on functions
on (a  u). it has then to be extended by gauge covariance to an
operator on b. this is parallel to our construction of the map r[]
in the equations (7), (8) and (10). an example of the quantization of
such an operator will be given in subsection 4.3.2.

 in order to be actually able to quantize classical expressions in the
hamiltonian formalism used so far, we will have to claim validity of the
symmetric criticality principle in the theory under consideration. this

19

means that critical points of the reduced action should correspond to
critical points of the unreduced one. validity of this principle cannot be
taken for granted. it will be valid, if the symmetry group s is compact,
or if it is abelian (more generally, unimodular) and acts freely [18].
these two cases cover our examples given below.

 until now we have conned ourselves to a xed conjugacy class []. in
general there will be a family of such conjugacy classes.
if it is not
possible to select one by means of physical considerations, we will have
to treat them on an equal footing. we will use the same space b
for every class, but they will be dierently represented as distributions
on  by means of []. the dierent conjugacy classes give rise to
dierent sectors, which are superselected as seen from the symmetric
theory. they correspond to dierent subspaces of invariant connections
embedded in a/g via r[]. we have to nd a physical interpretation
for the dierent conjugacy classes, the most natural being that of a
topological charge. this is purely classical, because the dierent con-
jugacy classes arise already in the classical reduction. we will see in
the next section that this case indeed occurs, namely for spherically
symmetric electromagnetism where [] gives the magnetic charge.

 classically a symmetric principal bre bundle is classied by a conju-
gacy class of homomorphisms and a reduced bundle, see theorem 2.1.
in the quantum theory, however, the conjugacy class of the homomor-
phisms will suce, because the space ab of generalized connections
contains connections on all the bundles over b, as proven in [42].

 the emergence of the higgs eld can be understood as a reection of
the information which is contained in those edges associated with a
cylindrical state which are located entirely in the orbits of s. e.g. in a
spherically symmetric theory they represent edges in a s2 orbit. this
justies even more the name point holonomies. from this picture
one can see that in general the function r
[]f will involve an innite
number of higgs vertices, where f   is a cylindrical function. if the
underlying graph contains an edge that lies neither entirely in an orbit
nor entirely in the manifold b, then f will depend on all components
of a connection in points along the edge.
in the symmetry reduced
theory some of the components are given by the higgs eld, so the full

20

dependence of f on a connection requires a continuous set of higgs
vertices in the union of all graphs underlying r

[]f .

 the procedure of the present section can be reversed, using a kaluza-
klein construction of a higgs eld as components of a connection in a
higher-dimensional, symmetric manifold. suppose we want to quantize
a dieomorphism invariant theory of a connection and a higgs eld,
for which there is a higher-dimensional kaluza-klein theory containing
only connection elds. then we can visualize the higgs vertices aris-
ing in the quantization of the lower-dimensional theory as remnants of
loops lying in the compactied extra dimensions. by blowing up a
lower-dimensional spin network with higgs vertices in this way in order
to obtain a higher-dimensional ordinary spin network, we get a quan-
tization of the kaluza-klein theory. this blowing up preserves, like
our symmetry reduction, gauge invariance, because the higgs vertices
transform under the adjoint representation of the structure group as
do loops based on the vertices.

4 examples

in this section we will give examples in order to illustrate some of the ideas
of the last section and to test them.

4.1

2 + 1 dimensional gravity

2 + 1 dimensional gravity can be obtained in terms of a symmetry reduction
of 3+1 dimensional gravity by imposing the existence of one spacelike killing
vector eld of constant norm. the extra condition on the norm of the killing
eld is necessary in order to eliminate a scalar eld which is related to its
norm. otherwise one would obtain 2 + 1 dimensional gravity coupled to a
massless scalar eld.

we therefore have the abelian symmetry group s = r (or s = so(2)),
and we assume the space  to have the topology  = b  r (or  = b  s1)
where b is a two-dimensional manifold. the group s acts freely on the
second component of  which means that f = {0}. hence, there can only
be one homomorphism : f  g, 0 7 1. here g = su(2) is the gauge
group of gravity, formulated as a gauge theory using real ashtekar variables.

21

in this case the reduced group z = g is identical to the full structure
group. because f is trivial, eq. (5) is trivially true and we have a one-
component higgs eld  taking values in lg. if we use the maurer-cartan
form  = dz, where z coordinatizes r, and the embedding  = id : r  r,
the reconstruction is

r: (ai

(15)

aidxa, ii) 7 ai
here the matrices i =  i
2 i form a basis of lg and xa, a = 1, 2 are coordi-
nates on a chart of b. this shows that the higgs eld gives the z-component
of the connection form.

aidxa + iidz.

following the steps of the last section, we obtain the conguration space
a and i on b

ab  u b of the reduced theory which consists of the elds ai
appearing in (15).

up to now we have imposed only the symmetry condition, not the con-
dition on the norm of the killing eld. this second condition serves to
remove the dynamical scalar eld. an equivalent quantum condition can be
formulated by allowing only trivial higgs vertices. this will eliminate the
dependence of the spin networks on generalized higgs elds, thereby remov-
ing their local degrees of freedom. so we arrive at the quantum conguration
space ab of vacuum 2 + 1 dimensional gravity.
we can now build an auxiliary hilbert space of integrable cylindrical func-
tions on ab, completely analogous to the unreduced theory. on this hilbert
space which is spanned by ordinary two-dimensional spin networks we can
represent the constraints and search for solutions. this has already been
done in ref. [20] starting from the classical symmetry reduction and quan-
tizing the classical conguration space. our quantum symmetry reduction
procedure gives the same results, but with a representation of the quantum
states of the reduced theory as symmetric states of the full quantum theory.
the reduction of this subsection can be generalized straightforwardly to
the case of an arbitrary gauge theory on  = b  rn, where b is an arbi-
trary d-dimensional manifold and s = rn acts on the second factor of .
a symmetry reduction will involve n components of a higgs eld, whereas
a quantum dimensional reduction from b  rn to b can be obtained by
postulating trivial higgs vertices of spin networks in b.

22

4.2 spherically symmetric electromagnetism

we will now reduce electromagnetism to a spherically symmetric one. al-
though spherically symmetric electromagnetism is almost trivial it is nev-
ertheless quite instructive for our purposes because the quantum symmetry
reduction can be carried out explicitly.

first, let us explain why we treat electromagnetism as a dieomorphism
invariant theory. this can, of course, not be true for pure electromagnetism
on, e.g. a minkowski background. but we are interested in the electromag-
netic eld as a eld of a reissner-nordstrm black hole. we therefore have to
couple electromagnetism to gravity, which ensures dieomorphism invariance.
the dynamics of the electromagnetic eld is then encoded in the hamiltonian
constraint. the dieomorphism constraint will only contain gravitational
elds, because in the spherically symmetric case dieomorphism invariance
of the electromagnetic eld is already imposed by the u(1)-gau constraint.
as a test model this coupled theory as a whole would be too complicated, so
we discard the gravitational eld by constraining it to be zero. this amounts
to treating the electromagnetic eld on a degenerate background which ren-
ders the hamiltonian ill-dened. but electric and magnetic uxes will be
well-dened, so that we, nevertheless, may study the kinematics of the elds.

4.2.1 classical symmetry reduction

we now have g = u(1), s = su(2) and in general f = u(1). the topology

respectively.

of space is  = r  s2 or  = r+  s2, implying b = r or b = r+,
we rst determine all conjugacy classes of the homomorphisms : u(1) 
u(1). because such a homomorphism is a one-dimensional unitary represen-
tation of u(1), it is given by its character. therefore we have the mappings

hom (u(1), u(1))/ad = z represented by the homomorphisms n: z 7 zn.
for the abelian group g the centralizers zn = u(1) are equal to the full
group. thus, a spherically symmetric principal bre bundle with structure
group u(1) is classied by an integer n, and, of course, all reduced bun-
dles are trivial, because b is contractible, and they are not needed for the
classication.

let us now determine the type of higgs eld allowed by eq. (5). this eld
is given by the map :ls  lg, where |lf = dn is already xed by the
bundle classication. here we have dimlg = 1, leaving only the possibilities

23

dim ker  = 2 or dim ker  = 3. in the case n 6= 0, dn is an isomorphism of
vector spaces, forbidding dim ker  = 3. so we have dim ker  = 2 and the
higgs eld  = |lf = 0 vanishes. this kind of reasoning can not be used
in the case n = 0. but looking at eq. (5) we see that n enters this equation
only in connection with adn(f ) for f  f . this occurrence is trivial in the
abelian case, so eq. (5) is independent of n. therefore, if it does not allow a
higgs eld for n 6= 0 it cannot allow a higgs eld for n = 0, too. this proves
that the reduced theory is a theory of a u(1)-connection only.
let us recall the reduced phase space structure from ref. [23]. the canon-
ical variables of the symmetry reduced theory are given by the radial com-
ponents p and i  of the electric eld and the u(1)-connection form, respec-
tively. they are subject to the gau constraint p  0 which enforces p to
be constant. the reduced phase space is two-dimensional with the canonical
variables p which is proportional to the electric charge and the canonically

conjugate  = rb dx . the electric charge is either a point charge sitting
in x = 0 if b = r+, or the charge of the wormhole  = r  s2.
4.2.2 quantum symmetry reduction

according to theorem 3.2 the physical hilbert space of spherically symmetric
electromagnetism is given by l2(ab/gb, dal), the space of gauge invariant,
ashtekar-lewandowski square integrable functions on the space of general-
ized u(1)-connections over b. it is spanned by u(1)-spin networks, which
are, due to gauge invariance and the one-dimensional nature of b, given by

(b)k , where b := exp izb

dx (x)

(16)

is the holonomy along b of the u(1)-connection i  and k  z is the only pa-
rameter, corresponding to irreducible u(1)-representations labeling the basis
states. we see that the reduced theory is particularly simple, having only two
canonical degrees of freedom. the physical hilbert space can be identied
with l2(u(1), dh), where dh is the haar measure on u(1).

before coming to the observables of the theory we will investigate the
quantum symmetry reduction r
[]. let the symmetric principal bre bundle
be classied by the homomorphism n, and let f = u(1) = exph3i 
su(2) be the isotropy subgroup. we then have to set (3) = dn(3) = i n
and (1,2) = 0 in eq. (6). the reconstruction of a u(1)-connection with

24

x-component i x: b  i r = lu(1) on q is given by the [n]-invariant
connection
(17)

n(i x dx) = i x dx + i n cos  d.

i  := r()

here x is a (local) coordinate of b and (, ) are the killing parameters
of the s-orbits. together they yield a (local) coordinate system (x, , ) of
b  s2. we can calculate the curvature of this [n]-invariant connection to
obtain the (densitized) magnetic eld of a dirac monopole with magnetic
charge n:

bx = n sin  , b = b = 0.

(18)

this conrms our claim that the conjugacy classes of homomorphisms cor-
respond to the values of a topological charge.

eq. (17) will now be used to pull back a spin network state to a function
on the space of invariant connections. to that end let e: [0, 1]   be an
edge in , running from e(0) = (x1, 1, 1) to e(1) = (x2, 2, 2), chosen such
that a parameterization () is possible along e (otherwise we can cut e in
pieces and set () = 0 if  is constant along a piece without aecting the
following). then the i -holonomy along e is given by

he(i) = exp[ze

dt(i x x + i n  cos )]

= exp(cid:18)iz x2

x1

dxx(cid:19) exp(cid:18)inz 2

1

d cos ()(cid:19)

=: h(e)(ix)(e)n .

here (e) := [x1, x2] = [x(e(0)), x(e(1))]  b is an edge in b, and h(e)(i x)
is the holonomy of the reduced connection i x along it. e is a phase factor
depending only on the geometry of e.

if t, k is a spin network with a graph    and a labeling k of its
edges with irreducible u(1)-representations (a labeling of the vertices is not
necessary for gauge invariant u(1)-spin networks because it is already given
uniquely by the edge labeling), we can evaluate it on a [n]-invariant connec-
tion: if e() denotes the edge set of  we have

t, k(i) = yee()
= yee()

he(i)ke

(19)

h(e)(ix)ke yee()

(e)nke = (, k)n yee()

h(e)(ix)ke.

25

here , k := qee() ke

of t and its labeling.

e

is a phase factor depending only on the geometry

the right hand side of the last equation can be written as the evaluation
of a spin network state in b on the connection i x. in order to do this we
will dene a projection  which assigns to a spin network t, k in  a spin
network (t, k) in b. the set of vertices v () of  can be projected on a
nite set

(v ()) := {x(v) : v  v ()} =: {x(i)}1i|(v ())| ,

where we have ordered the elements of (v ()) such that x(i) < x(j) for
i < j. their number is bounded by |(v ())|  |v ()|. let  be chosen  if
necessary by inverting edges and splitting edges by introducing new vertices 
such that each edge e  e() either lies entirely in an orbit of s, in which
case we dene (e) := , or it has a projection (e) = [x(i), x(i+1)] for some
1  i  |(v ()| and x(e(t)) increases monotonely in t. to every projected
edge (e) we assign the point xm((e)) := 1
2(x(e(0)) + x(e(1))) in its interior.
we can now dene the projected spin network:

denition 4.1 let t, k be a u(1)-spin network in  = b  s2, the graph
 be chosen as above.

the projected graph ()  b is given by its edge set

e(()) := {(e) : e  e(), (e) 6= } = {[x(i), x(i+1)] : 1  i < |(v ())|}
and its vertex set

v (()) := (v ()).

the labeling of the projected graph descending from the spin network t, k

is given by

(k)(e) := x|esxm((e))|=1

ke

for any edge (e)  e(()). here sxm((e)) is the s-orbit through xm((e)),
and the condition |e  sxm((e))| = 1 in the sum ensures that we count only
the charge of edges running transversally through sxm((e)).

the projected spin network is given by (t, k) := t(),(k).

26

by means of the projected spin network, we can write eq. (19) as

t, k(i) = (, k)n yeb e(())
= (, k)n yeb e(())

heb (ix)ke

yee():(e)=eb
heb (ix)(k)eb = (, k)n(t, k)(ix).

this equation enables us to write

[n]t, k = (, k)n(t, k).
r

(20)

we can see that r
[n]t  b is cylindrical on ab for any spin network
t  . this convenient circumstance is related to the vanishing of the
higgs eld and cannot be taken for granted in cases of other structure groups.
here this fact allows us to compose the maps [] and [] in the diagram at
the end of section 3.2 to obtain a map

[]  []:   



reminiscent of a group averaging map. in fact the symmetry reduction consid-
ered here can be imposed by supplementing electrodynamics with a further
constraint besides the gau constraint to arrive at an abelian bf -theory
[39]. thus, the symmetry can be reduced by means of a rigging map anal-
ogous to []  []. the vanishing higgs eld also causes the appearance of
the topological charge n as a power of the phase factor only. furthermore,
the above calculations exhibit the fact that a projected spin network state is
gauge invariant if and only if the original spin network state in  is gauge
invariant. this follows from the fact that gauge invariance in  forces the
spin network labeling to fulll

x|es1|=1

ke = x|es2|=1

ke

for any two s-orbits s1 and s2 not containing a vertex of the graph  (for
simplicity we assume that all edges are oriented outwards). therefore a gauge
invariant spin network will project to a spin network with labeling keb = k
for each edge eb of the projected graph. this yields the gauge invariant spin
network (b)k dened above as projected spin network.

27

let us now write down the action of a [n]-symmetric state as distribution

on . for a spin network t, k it is given by

[n]((b)k)(t, k) = zab

dal (b)k r

[n]t, k

(21)

= (, k)nzab

dal (b)k t(), (k)

= (, k)n {b}, () {k}, (k) .

it is non-vanishing only if t, k is gauge invariant implied by () = {b},
and if the charge (k) = p|esx|=1 ke equals the labeling k of the symmetric
state.

4.2.3 observables

we will now quantize the observables p and  found in the classical reduction.
p is canonically conjugate to the connection , and standard quantization
rules lead in the connection representation to the quantization p = i 
 .
acting on a gauge invariant state (16) this yields p(b)k = k(b)k. we see
that spin network states are eigenstates of p. all the eigenvalues of p are real,
which shows that it is essentially selfadjoint. furthermore, they are discrete
exhibiting electric charge quantization as integer multiples of an elementary
charge (this fact has already been observed in ref. [43] in the unsymmetric
theory). the value of this elementary charge is, however, not xed because
p is only proportional to the electric charge. the factor of proportionality
ensures the correct dimension and scales the elementary charge. this factor
is arbitrary and is related to the normalization of the electromagnetic action.
in the following we will denote the basis states of the hilbert space

l2(u(1), dh) as

|ki := (b)k.

these states span an orthonormal basis with respect to the haar measure on
u(1) = ab/gb which derives from the ashtekar-lewandowski measure on
ab. they are labeled by the charge eigenvalues according to p|ki = k |ki.
now we have to quantize  = rb  = i log b. recall that holonomies
are well-dened as operators in the loop quantization. this fact suggests to
use b instead of . b can straightforwardly be promoted to the creation
operator

b |ki = (b)k+1 = |k + 1i ,

28

which is unitary because it is invertible and preserves the norm of states it
acts on. in view of b = exp(i) the operator b has indeed to be unitary.
note that it is the haar measure on u(1), which derives from the ashtekar-
lewandowski measure on the unconstrained space (before solving the gau
constraint) that incorporates the classical reality conditions correctly.

we will now close this subsection by showing that p and b have the

correct commutator.
theorem 4.1 (p, exp(i)) 7 (p, b) is a representation of the classical
poisson -algebra on the hilbert space l2(u(1), dh).
proof: we have already seen, that the -relations p = p and exp(i) =
exp(i) are represented properly.
because p and  are canonically conjugate, we have the poisson bracket

{p, exp(i)} =

d exp(i)

d

= i exp(i).

the only non-vanishing matrix elements of the commutator [p, b] are given
by

hk |[p, b]| k  1i = hk |k| ki  hk |(k  1)| ki = .

we, therefore, have the relation

implementing the correct representation of the poisson structure.

[p, b] = b = i{p, exp(i)}

(22)

4.3 spherically symmetric quantum gravity

our last example deals with spherically symmetric quantum gravity. un-
doubtedly this one of our three examples is of the greatest physical interest
because it describes quantum properties of non-rotating black holes. the
classical symmetry and constraint reduction reveals that there is only one
physical conguration degree of freedom, the mass (or a canonical pair: mass
and time). this is similar to spherically symmetric electromagnetism dis-
cussed above which has only the electric charge as physical degree of freedom.
however, it can be anticipated that gravity will be more dicult since its
constraints are more complicated.

in the present paper we treat in detail only the gau constraint and
comment briey on the solution of the dieomorphism constraint. the more
complicated hamiltonian constraint will be dealt with elsewhere [31].

29

4.3.1 symmetry reduction

we now specialize our general framework to the case s = su(2), f = u(1)
and g = su(2) (we will use real ashtekar variables). the topology of the
space  will be  = b  s2 with b = r or b = r+.
first we have to nd all conjugacy classes of homomorphisms : f =
u(1)  su(2) = g. in order to do that we can make use of eq. (4). we
need the following information about su(2) (see, e.g. ref. [40]).

lemma 4.1 the standard maximal torus of su(2) is given by

t (su(2)) = {diag (z, z1)| z  u(1)} = u(1).

the weyl group of su(2) is the permutation group of two elements,

w (su(2)) = s2 ,

its generator acting on t (su(2)) by diag (z, z1) 7 diag (z1, z).

all homomorphisms in hom (u(1), t (su(2))) are then given by

k: z 7 diag (zk, zk)

for any k  z, as in the electromagnetic example. however, here we have to
divide out the action of the weyl group, leaving only the maps k, k  n0,
as representatives of all conjugacy classes of homomorphisms. we see that
spherically symmetric gravity has a topological charge taking values in n0
(in the dreibein, not in the metric formulation, as we will see below).

we will represent f as the subgroup exph3i < su(2) of the symmetry
group s, and use the homomorphisms k: exp t3 7 exp kt3, out of each con-
jugacy class. this amounts to a partial gauge xing called 3-gauge in the fol-
lowing. as reduced structure group we obtain zg(k(f )) = exph3i = u(1)
for k 6= 0 and zg(0(f )) = su(2) (k = 0 leads to the manifestly symmet-
ric connections of ref. [36]). the map |lf is then given by dk:h3i 
lg, 3 7 k3. the remaining components of  which give us the higgs eld,
are determined by (1, 2)  lg, and are subject to eq. (5). this equation
can here be written as

  ad 3 = ad d(3)   .

30

using ad 31 = 2 and ad 32 = 1 we obtain the equation
(a02  b01) = k(a0[3, (1)] + b0[3, (2)]),

where a01 + b02, a0, b0  r is an arbitrary element of lf. since a0 and b0
are arbitrary this is equivalent to the two equations

k[3, (1)] = (2)

and k[3, (2)] = (1).

the general ansatz

(1) = a11 + b12 + c13

, (2) = a21 + b22 + c23

with arbitrary parameters ai, bi, ci  r yields the equations
k(a12  b11) = a21 + b22 + c23 ,
k(a22 + b21) = a11 + b12 + c13 .

(23)

these equations have a non-trivial solution only if k = 1, for which we get

b2 = a1 , b2 = b1

and c1 = c2 = 0 .

we shall discuss this main case rst where we also will see how the present ap-
proach is related to that of refs. [21, 22] and will comment on the physically
uninteresting ones (k 6= 1) which have a vanishing higgs eld afterwards.
the conguration variables of the system are the above elds a, b, c : b 
r of the u(1)-connection form a = c(x) 3 dx on the one hand and the two
higgs eld components

|h1i: b  h1, 2i, x 7 a(x)1 + b(x)2

on the other hand.

under a local u(1)-gauge transformation z(x) = exp t(x)3 they trans-

form as

c 7 c +

dt

comparing with ref. [21] we see that the above variable c transforms as the
connection coecient a1 there and the variables (a, b) as (a2, a3). however,
the reconstructed connection form

a(x, , ) = c(x)3dx + (a(x)d + b(x) sin d)1 
(b(x)d + a(x) sin d)2 + cos  d 3

used in refs. [21, 22] (now expressed in terms of real ashtekar variables)
where ni
 are the standard unit vectors in polar coordinates.
the two connection forms dier, however, only by a gauge rotation g1 :=
exp(ni
we note that the term cos  d 3 in eq. (25) which is the only term
independent of the elds a, b and c, in the connection form a(x, , ) derived
above leads automatically to the appearance of a3 as the combination a32
in the connection form (26) of refs. [21, 22]. this subtraction of 2 (which
does not appear in ref. [36]) has been added by hand in ref. [21] in order to
ensure the correct transformation of (a2, a3) in the dening representation
of so(2).
the calculation above shows that c has to be identied with a1 and
(up to a rescaling with 2 used in ref. [21] in order to get the standard
symplectic structure) (a, b) with (a2, a3). we will here rescale the variables,
too, and denote the rescaled ones by (a1, a2, a3). their conjugate variables
are (e1, e2, e3), and the symplectic structure is  adapted to our notation
using the immirzi parameter   given by
{ai(x), ej (y)} =


4
where  = 8g is the gravitational constant.

j
i (x, y)

(27)

we recall [21, 22] that the metric on  is given by

(qab) = diag(

e
2e1 , e1, e1 sin2 ) , e = (e2)2 + (e3)2 .

(28)

the functions e1 and e are closely related to two important geometrical
quantities:

32

the surface a(x) of the 2-dimensional spherical orbit generated by the

symmetry group s at x  b is given by

a(x) = 4 e1(x)

(29)

and the spherically symmetric three-dimensional volume element dv trans-
verse to those orbits is

dv =

4
2

e1 e dx .

(30)

we nally turn briey to the case k 6= 1 which is associated with vanishing
higgs elds (i) = 0, i = 1, 2 or, equivalently, a2 = a3 = 0. the vanishing
of the canonical variables a2 and a3 implies that their canonically conjugate
momenta e2 and e3 become irrelevant, too, and we may put them to zero,
e2 = e3 = 0. this means that the metric (28) and the volume (30) become
degenerate and that we do not have a non-vanishing volume element.

thus, the sectors with k 6= 1 describe degenerate sectors which are, how-
ever, dierent from the one found in ref. [21]. there a degenerate sector
with vanishing volume was found in our (k = 1)-sector after solving the
constraints. on our (k 6= 1)-sectors the dieomorphism and hamiltonian
constraint will be trivially fullled, but the k = 1-sector has nontrivial con-
straints whose solution manifold has several sectors.

that the degenerate sectors for k 6= 1 here are dierent from the de-
[21] can be seen as follows: for k 6= 1 the last term
generate one of ref.
(cos  d 3) in eq. (25) gets multiplied by k and as a consequence the sub-
tracted constant 2 in eq. (26), too, leading to dierent connection forms

even for a2 = a3 = 0.

thus, if we are interested in geometrically interesting systems with non-

vanishing volumes we have to stick to the sector k = 1.

4.3.2 quantization of the gau constraint

although the gau constraint can be solved by restricting to gauge invariant
spin networks we here give a regularization in order to exhibit more concretely
the role of the reduced gauge group.

classically, one uses a partial gauge xing reducing the structure group
su(2) to u(1). this is explicit in the symmetry reduction of the gau
constraint

dx(x)(cid:0)(e1) + a2e3  a3e2(cid:1)

33

ge[] =

4

 zb

which is taken from [21] adapted to our notation. (x) is a lagrange mul-
tiplier. in a pure, one-dimensional u(1)-gauge theory one would encounter
the constraint (e1)  0. here, we have an additional term which provides
coupling to the higgs eld. for the sake of clarity we will regularize these
two terms one after another.

by standard methods we get

in the rst row, we used the standard quantization rule

e1 =


4i



a1

taking into account the symplectic structure (27). the functional derivative
acts on a cylindrical function f which depends on edge and point holonomies.
as remarked in section 3.1 we start the quantization procedure on the space
(a  u) due to classical gauge xing. with  chosen as in the present
section a holonomy on this space takes the form

he = exp(ze

dxa1(x)3)

giving rise to the above derivative.

in the second step above we integrated by parts to be able to integrate
over the -distribution in the following step. because there the holonomies
are abelian, the trace does actually not depend on t so that we can include
it into the argument of the t-derivative in order to integrate over t. because
of the abelian nature the left and right invariant vector eld components x 3

34

and x 3
comparison with a su(2)-theory.

r are identical. however, we keep both of them to make possible a

the higgs coupling term has to be rephrased before proceeding: we
introduce polar coordinates (a, ) in the (a2, a3)-plane, i. e., (a2, a3) =
(a cos , a sin ). these variables have the advantage that a is gauge invari-
ant, whereas  can be gauged arbitrarily. after replacing the variables e2
and e3 with the respective derivative operators in the course of quantization,
we encounter the derivation

a2


a3  a3



a2

=




the action of which on a point holonomy hv(a, ) = exp a(cos 1 + sin 2)
(in our 3-gauge) can be calculated, using

to be

hv(a, ) = exp(3)hv(a, 0) exp(3) ,

hv


= 3hv  hv3.

now we are in a position to quantize the remaining part of the gau con-
straint:

dx(x)(a2e3  a3e2)f
dx(x)



f

we can now combine the operators to obtain the quantization

of the gau constraint which has a nite action on cylindrical functions and
is therefore densely dened.

35

the structure of the operator is as expected: it is a sum over vertices
weighted with the lagrange multiplier. in each vertex it acts as the sum of
a left invariant vector eld for each incoming edge, a right invariant vector
eld for each outgoing edge, and a left as well as right invariant vector eld
for the point holonomy in the vertex. that the point holonomy contributes
by left and right invariant vector elds represents the fact that the higgs
eld transforms in the adjoint representation of su(2). the sum of vector
elds is in complete agreement with the denition of gauge invariant spin
networks with higgs. however, ge is a sum only of the third components
of the vector elds in accordance with our 3-gauge. recall that ge is just
the quantization on the space of functions over (a  u), and that it has to
be extended to our full reduced hilbert space of functions on (a  u)[] by
gauge covariance.
we can change the partial gauge xing by performing a global su(2)-
gauge transformation with g  su(2)\(f ). this transformation will con-
jugate the holonomies appearing in the vector elds. using the formula



g1hg

= gt 
h

(g1)t

which can be proved by using the chain rule, we get the transformation rule

x i

l(g1hg) = tr (cid:18)(g1hgi)t
= tr (cid:18)(hgig1)t 

(g1hg)(cid:19)
h(cid:19) = ad ij(g)x j



l(h)

where ad ij(g) are matrix elements in the adjoint representation dened by
ad gi = gig1 =: ad ij(g)j. the right invariant vector elds transform
analogously. the transformed gau constraint in the g3g1-gauge is now

3[] = ixvb
g

(v)

 xe(1)=v

x 3
l(g1heg) 

l(g1hvg)  x 3

r(g1hvg)


x 3

r(g1heg) + x 3

 xe(0)=v
= ad 3i(g) gi[] =: g[i].

36

here gi are the components of the full su(2)-gau constraint smeared with
a function , whereas g is the full gau constraint smeared with a function
i := ad 3i(g). allowing arbitrary su(2)-gauge transformations g, we can
change i arbitrarily. this shows that the gau constraint on b is the
full su(2)-constraint forcing su(2)-spin networks with higgs to be gauge
invariant.

we want to stress here the necessity of the mathematical apparatus de-
veloped in section 3: it enabled us to take the role of the reduced gauge
group into account, it provides us with an interpretation of symmetric states
as generalized states of the unreduced theory and theorem 3.2 shows that all
symmetric states can be obtained by using the one-dimensional spin networks
used in the present subsection.

4.3.3 quantization of the dieomorphism constraint

we conclude by making a few remarks on the dieomorphism constraint. it
can be solved by group averaging where the dieomorphism group acts by
dragging the higgs vertices. but we can alternatively regularize the dieo-
morphism constraint and solve it innitesimally. the no-go theorem of ref.
[12, appendix c] is evaded by the one-dimensional nature of our graphs: dif-
feomorphisms act only by dragging the ends of edges and the higgs vertices
attached to them. but they can not deform an edge transversally, and a
longitudinal deformation can always be absorbed by a reparameterization of
the edge. the quantized constraint is given by lie derivatives on the higgs
vertex positions leading to the well known solutions in 

b.

5 conclusions

the main part of this paper is intended to dene a space of symmetric states
in a dieomorphism invariant theory of connections, to investigate its prop-
erties and, especially, to equip it with a calculus. this is achieved in theo-
rem 3.2. the results show that there are some subtleties, mainly due to the
classical partial gauge xing, which should be relaxed in the quantum theory.
in order to illustrate dierent points of the general framework we dis-

cussed several concrete examples:

2 + 1 dimensional gravity and spherically symmetric electromagnetism
are quite easy to deal with. quantum symmetry reduction of these models

37

yields the expected results. holonomy variables turned out to be well suited
in order to quantize the electromagnetic model and its observables. further-
more, the ashtekar-lewandowski measure incorporates the classical reality
conditions correctly. the electromagnetic model exhibits a simple reduction
of the degrees of freedom to nitely many ones corresponding to the classical
theory.

spherically symmetric gravity is the only example which has necessarily
a higgs eld in physically meaningful applications. this property allows a
non-trivial action of constraints. the gau and dieomorphism constraint
are as easy to deal with as in the full 3+1 dimensional theory. unfortunately,
the hamiltonian constraint does not seem to be more easily solvable within
the framework of loop quantum gravity with its spin network states than
in the full theory. in refs. [21, 22] it was solved, but it, together with the
dieomorphism constraint, had to be rephrased into a form not well suited
for loop quantization.

but regularized analogously to ref. [14] the hamiltonian constraint op-
erator might be dened and analyzed more easily, because of the simplicity
of one-dimensional graphs it acts on. there is no place for it to create new
edges and it will create only higgs vertices in the neighborhood of a higgs
vertex it acts on, thereby changing the spin of the edge connecting the old
and the new higgs vertex. note in this context that the appearance of si-
mons subgraph of ref. [44] is generic in the symmetry reduced theory: the
newly created vertices can always be shifted to their neighboring vertices.
details and further developments are left for forthcoming publications [31].
a rst physical application of the above considerations in the case of
gravity is to calculate the spectrum of the area operator in the spherically
symmetric sector [32].
