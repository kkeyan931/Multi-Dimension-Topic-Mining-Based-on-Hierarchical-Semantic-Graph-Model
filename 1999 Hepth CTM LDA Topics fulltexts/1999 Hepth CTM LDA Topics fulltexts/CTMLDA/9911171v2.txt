abstract

the structure constants for moyal brackets of an innite basis of functions on the alge-
braic manifolds m of pseudo-unitary groups u (n+, n) are provided. they generalize
the virasoro and w algebras to higher dimensions. the connection with volume-
preserving dieomorphisms on m , higher generalized-spin and tensor operator algebras
of u (n+, n) is discussed. these centrally-extended, innite-dimensional lie-algebras
provide also the arena for non-linear integrable eld theories in higher dimensions, resid-
ual gauge symmetries of higher-extended objects in the light-cone gauge and c -algebras
for tractable non-commutative versions of symmetric curved spaces.

the general study of innite-dimensional algebras and groups, their quantum deformations
(in particular, central extensions) and representation theory has not progressed very far, except
for some important achievements in one- and two-dimensional systems, and there can be no
doubt that a breakthrough in the subject would provide new insights into the two central
problems of modern physics: unication of all interactions and exact solvability in qft and
statistics.

the aforementioned achievements refer mainly to virasoro and kac-moody symmetries (see
e.g. [1, 2]), which have played a fundamental role in the analysis and formulation of conformally-
invariant (quantum and statistical) eld theories in one and two dimensions, and systems in
higher dimensions which in some essential respects are one- or two-dimensional (e.g. string the-
ory). generalizations of the virasoro symmetry, as the algebra di(s1) of reparametrisations
of the circle, lead to the innite-dimensional lie algebras of area-preserving dieomorphisms
sdi() of two-dimensional surfaces . these algebras naturally appear as a residual gauge
symmetry in the theory of relativistic membranes [3], which exhibits an intriguing connection
with the quantum mechanics of space constant (e.g. vacuum congurations) su (n ) yang-mills
potentials in the limit n   [4]; the argument that the internal symmetry space of the u ()
pure yang-mills theory must be a functional space, actually the space of congurations of a
[5]. moreover, the w and w1+ algebras of area-preserving
string, was pointed out in ref.
dieomorphisms of the cylinder [6] generalize the underlying virasoro gauged symmetry of the
light-cone two-dimensional induced gravity discovered by polyakov [7] by including all positive
conformal-spin currents [8], and induced actions for these w-gravity theories have been pro-
posed [9, 10]. also, the w1+ (dynamical) symmetry has been identied by [11] as the set of
canonical transformations that leave invariant the hamiltonian of a two-dimensional electron
gas in a perpendicular magnetic eld, and appears to be relevant in the classication of all
the universality classes of incompressible quantum uids and the identication of the quantum
numbers of the excitations in the quantum hall eect. higher-spin symmetry algebras where
introduced in [12] and could provide a guiding principle towards the still unknown m-theory.
it is remarkable that area-preserving dieomorphisms, higher-spin and w algebras can
be seen as distinct members of a one-parameter family l(su(2)) or the non-compact ver-
sion l(su(1, 1)) of non-isomorphic [13] innite-dimensional lie-algebras of su (2) and
su (1, 1) tensor operators, more precisely, the factor algebra l(su(2)) = u(su(2))/i of
the universal enveloping algebra u(su(2)) by the ideal i = ( c  h2)u(su(2)) generated by the
casimir operator c of su(2) ( denotes an arbitrary complex number). the structure constants
for l(su(2)) and l(su(1, 1)) are well known for the racah-wigner basis of tensor operators
[14], and they can be written in terms of clebsch-gordan and (generalized) 6j-symbols [3, 8, 15].
another interesting feature of l(su(2)) is that, when  coincides with the eigenvalue of c in
an irrep dj of su (2), that is  = j(j + 1), there exists and ideal  in l(su(2)) such that the
quotient l(su(2))/  sl(2j +1, c) or su(2j +1), by taking a compact real form of the complex
lie algebra [16]. that is, for  = j(j + 1) the innite-dimensional algebra l(su(2)) collapses to
l(su(2))  sdi(s2)
a nite-dimensional one. this fact was used in [3] to approximate lim
h0
by su(n )|n (large number of colors).

the generalization of these constructions to general unitary groups proves to be quite un-
wieldy, and a canonical classication of u (n )-tensor operators has, so far, been proven to exist
only for u (2) and u (3) (see [14] and references therein). tensor labeling is provided in these
cases by the gelfand-weyl pattern for vectors in the carrier space of the irreps of u (n ).

in this letter, a quite appropriate basis of operators for l~(u(n+, n)), ~ = (1, . . . , n ),
n  n+ + n, is provided and the structure constants, for the particular case of the bo-
son realization of quantum associative operatorial algebras on algebraic manifolds mn+ n
=
u (n+, n)/u (1)n , are calculated. the particular set of operators in u(u(n+, n)) is the fol-
lowing:

index i  (i1, . . . , in ) of l in (1) represents a n -dimensional vector which, for the present, is
taken to lie on an half-integral lattice; the lower index m symbolizes a integral upper-triangular
n n matrix, and |m| means absolute value of all its entries. thus, the operators li
m are labeled
by n + n (n  1)/2 = n (n + 1)/2 indices, in the same way as wave functions i

boson operator realization g  aa of the generators of u(n+, n) for which things simplify
greatly. indeed, we shall understand that the quotient by the ideal generated by polynomials

standard commutator (4) for operators li

where identied as the primary quantum deformation w of the classical algebra w of area-
preserving dieomorphysms of the cylinder (see ref. [19]).

(12)

for large r, we can benet from the use of algebraic-computing programs like [20] to deal

with the high number of partitions.

our boson operator realization g  aa of the u(n+, n) generators corresponds to
the particular case of ~0 = (n, 0, . . . , 0) for the casimir eigenvalues, so that the commutation
relations (9) are related to the particular algebra l~0(u(n+, n)) (see below for more general
cases). a dierent (minimal) realization of l(su(1, 1)) in terms of a single boson (a, a), which
corresponds to c = sc(sc  1) = 3/16 for the critical value sc = 3/4 of the symplin degree of
freedom s, was given in [21]; this case is also related to the symplecton algebra of [14]. note the
close resemblance between the algebra (9) and the leading structure constants (11) and the
quantum deformation w  l0(su(1, 1)) of the algebra of area-preserving dieomorphisms of
the cylinder [8, 19], although we recognize that the case discussed in this letter is far richer.

if the analyticity of the symbols li

m of (1) is taken into account, then one should worry
(u(n+, n)) 

m |  = i  (p> |m| +p< |m|)/2  n } of polynomial functions on g, the

makes possible the existence of conjugated pairs (li

i + i

0 is central (commutes with everything)
and the lie algebra two-cocycle (13) denes a non-trivial central extension of l~0(u(n+, n))
by u (1).

a thorough study of the lie-algebra cohomology of l~(u(n+, n)) and its irreps still remains
to be acoomplished; it requires a separate attention and shall be left for future works. two-
cocycles like (13) provide the essential ingredient to construct invariant geometric action func-
tionals on coadjoint orbits of l~(u(n+, n)) see e.g. [10] for the derivation of the wznw ac-
tion of d = 2 matter elds coupled to chiral w gravity background from w  l0(su(1, 1))).

here, l(u(n+, n)) plays the role of gauge symplectic (volume-preserving) dieomorphisms

. a particularly interesting case might be su (2, 2) =
u (2, 2)/u (1): the conformal group in 3 + 1 (or the ads group in 4 + 1) dimensions, in an
attempt to construct conformal gravities in realistic dimensions. the innite-dimensional alge-
bra l(u(2, 2)) might be seen as the generalization of the virasoro (two-dimensional) conformal
symmetry to 3 + 1 dimensions.

finally, let me comment on the potential relevance of the c -algebras l~(g) on tractable
non-commutative versions [24] of symmetric curved spaces m = g/h, where the notion of a
pure state i
m replaces that of a point. the possibility of describing phase-space physics in
terms of the quantum analog of the algebra of functions (the covariant symbols li
m), and the
absence of localization expressed by the heisenberg uncertainty relation, was noticed a long
time ago by dirac [25]. just as the standard dierential geometry of m can be described by
using the algebra c(m ) of smooth complex functions  on m (that is, lim~
l~(g), when
h0

considered as an associative, commutative algebra), a non-commutative geometry for m can be
described by using the algebra l~(g), seen as an associative algebra with a non-commutative
-product like (7,8). the appealing feature of a non-commutative space m is that a g-invariant
lattice structure can be constructed in a natural way, a desirable property as regards nite
models of quantum gravity (see e.g.
indeed, as already mentioned,
l~(g) collapses to matd(c) (the full matrix algebra of d  d complex matrices) whenever 
coincides with the eigenvalue of c in a d-dimensional irrep d~ of g. this fact provides a
nite (d-points) fuzzy or cellular description of the non-commutative space m , the classical
(commutative) case being recovered in the limit ~  . the notion of space itself could be
the collection of all of them, enclosed in a single irrep of l~(g) for general ~, with dierent
multiplicities, as it actually happens with the reduction of an irrep of the centrally-extended

[26] and refs. therein).

virasoro group under its sl(2, ) subgroup [27]; the multiplicity should increase with ~ (the
density of points), so that classical-like spaces are more abundant. it is also a very important
feature of l~(u(n+, n)) that the quantization deformation scheme (7) does not aect the
maximal nite-dimensional subalgebra su(n+, n) (good observables or preferred coordinates
[17]) of non-commuting position operators

y = 

y = 

2h ( g + g) , y = i

, where  denotes a parameter that gives y dimensions of length
on the algebraic manifold mn+n
(e.g., the square root of the planck area hg). the volume vj of the n  1 submanifolds mj of
= mn  . . .  m2 (see e.g. [28] for a denition of ag manifolds) is
the ag manifold mn+n
proportional to the eigenvalue j of the su(n+, n) casimir operator cj in those coordinates:
vj = jj. large volumes (at-like spaces) correspond to a high density of points (large ). in
the classical limit   0,   , the coordinates y commute.
