abstract

an irreducible antield brst quantization method for reducible
gauge theories is proposed. the general formalism is illustrated in the
case of the freedman-townsend model.

pacs number: 11.10.ef

1 introduction

there are two main approaches to the quantization of gauge theories with
open algebras, both related to the brst symmetry. the rst one is based
on the hamiltonian formalism [1][6], while the second one relies on the
lagrangian formulation [6][11]. both methods can be applied to irreducible,
as well as to reducible gauge theories. in the irreducible case the ghosts can
be regarded as one-forms dual to the vector elds associated with the gauge
transformations.
in the reducible situation this interpretation fails, being
necessary to add ghosts of ghosts together with their antields. the ghosts
of ghosts are required in order to accommodate the reducibility relations to
the cohomology of the (a model of) longitudinal exterior dierential along

the gauge orbits [6], while their corresponding antields ensure the acyclicity
of the koszul-tate operator at non-vanishing antighost numbers.

in this paper we propose an irreducible brst approach to the quanti-
zation of on-shell reducible lagrangian gauge theories. in consequence, the
ghosts of ghosts and their antields are absent. our treatment mainly focuses
on: (i) transforming the initial redundant gauge theory into an irreducible
one in a manner that allows the substitution of the brst quantization of the
reducible system with that of the irreducible theory, and (ii) quantizing the
irreducible theory along the antield-brst ideas. we mention that the idea
of replacing a reducible system by an equivalent irreducible one appeared
for the rst time in the hamiltonian context [6], [12] and was developed re-
cently in the case of the quantization of hamiltonian systems with o-shell
reducible rst-class constraints [13].

our paper is structured in ve sections. in section 2 we start with an
l-stage reducible theory, and derive an irreducible system by means of con-
structing an irreducible koszul-tate dierential associated with the original
reducible one. the irreducible koszul-tate complex is obtained by requiring
that all the antighost number two co-cycles become trivial under an ap-
propriate redenition of the antighost number two antields. this request
implies the enlargement of both eld and antield spectra. section 3 focuses
on the derivation of the irreducible brst symmetry corresponding to the
irreducible theory inferred in section 2, emphasizing that we can replace the
antield brst quantization of the irreducible theory by that of the irre-
ducible system. in section 4 we illustrate our procedure in the case of the
freedman-townsend model. section 5 ends the paper with some conclusions.

where s0/0 = 0 stand for the elds equations. for the sake of notational
simplicity we take the elds to be bosonic. the subsequent discussion can
be straightforwardly extended to fermions modulo the introduction of some
appropriate phase factors.

the reducible brst symmetry corresponding to the above reducible the-
ory, sr = r + r +   , contains two basic dierentials. the rst one,
r, named the koszul-tate dierential, realizes an homological resolution of
smooth functions dened on the stationary surface of eld equations, while
the second one, r, represents a model of longitudinal derivative along the
gauge orbits and accounts for the gauge invariances. for rst-stage reducible
theories, the construction of r requires the introduction of the antields

1 and c 
2, with the grassmann parities () and antighost numbers
(antigh) given by

0,

reducible theories, apart from the above antield spectrum, one should add
the antields c 
existing antighost number three co-cycles yielded by (10) if one takes into
account the reducibility relations. in general, for an l-stage reducible system

the antield spectrum will contain the variables

k(cid:17) = k + 1 mod 2, antigh(cid:16)c 

in order to prevent the appearance of any non trivial co-cycle at positive
antighost numbers.

further implies that the antields (cid:16)c 

the problem to be investigated in this section is the derivation of an irre-
ducible theory associated with a starting l-stage reducible gauge system. in
this light, our main idea is to redene the antields  
1 in such a way that all
the non trivial co-cycles (11) become trivial. the triviality of these co-cycles
are no longer necessary as
there are also no non trivial co-cycles at antighost numbers greater that two.
the implementation of this idea leads to an irreducible gauge theory that
possesses the same physical observables like the original reducible one. in
order to clarify our irreducible mechanism, we gradually investigate the cases
l = 1, 2, and then generalize the results to an arbitrary l.

k(cid:17)k=2,,l+1

2.2 the case l = 1

here we start with the relations (810) and the reducibility relations (3). in
the light of the idea exposed above, we redene the antields

hence 2  0.
in consequence, the relations (13) do not imply any non
trivial co-cycles at antighost number two, so the antields c 
2 are no longer
necessary. thus, formula (13) helps us at deriving an irreducible theory. this
is the reason for changing the notation r into  in (13). in order to infer the
irreducible gauge transformations corresponding to the irreducible theory we
introduce the elds 2 and require that their antields, denoted by 
2, are
the non vanishing solutions to the equations

and by setting

(21)

the relations (1821) completely dene the irreducible koszul-tate com-
plex corresponding to an irreducible theory associated with the original re-
ducible one. at this point we can deduce the action of the irreducible theory
s0 [0, 2], as well as its gauge invariances. on the one hand, from the
standard brst prescription



2 = 

 s0
2

,

compared with (18), we nd that

s0 [0, 2] = s0 [0] .

(22)

(23)

on the other hand, the formulas (19) lead to the gauge transformations of
the irreducible theory under the form

0 = z 0

11, 2 = a 2

1 1.

(24)

thus, we can conclude that the irreducible theory is based on the original
action (see (23)) and the gauge transformations (24). from (23) it is clear
that the elds 2 are purely gauge, such that the physical observables of the
irreducible system coincide with those of the original reducible theory. the
equivalence between the physical observables represents a desirable feature
of our irreducible method, which can be gained if we set all the antields
corresponding to the new introduced elds to be -closed. on the other hand,
as these antields should not represent non trivial co-cycles, it is necessary
to construct the theory such that they are also -exact. anticipating a bit,
we remark that for higher order reducible theories it is necessary to further
enlarge the eld and antield spectra in order to enforce the above discussed
-exactness.

2.3 the case l = 2

in this situation we start with the denitions of  given by (1821). however,
we have to account in addition of the second stage reducibility relations (4).
on behalf of these supplementary reducibility relations, we nd that the

2 is no longer invertible, as it displays some on-shell null vectors,

to be solved remains the -exactness of

there are no non trivial co-cycles at antighost number one. the equations

in conclusion, in the case l = 2
the formulas (1821) and (30) completely dene the irreducible koszul-tate
complex. thus, the irreducible theory is based also on action (23), subject
to the gauge transformations

11, 2 = a 2

1 1 + z 2

33,

(32)

where 3 are some additional gauge parameters due to (30).

from the above analysis for l = 1, 2 it seems that there appear some
problems linked with locality. indeed, the matrices d2
2 present in (12) and
(13), and also the solution of the equations (16) are non-local in general.
however, the non-locality involved with (16) compensates in a certain way
that from the relations (13), such that the irreducible gauge transformations
(24) are local. a similar observation can be made with respect to the case
l = 2. in conclusion, the non-locality present within the intermediate steps
of the construction of the irreducible koszul-tate complex plays no role in the
irreducible theory. moreover, the non-locality mentioned in the above brings
no contribution when comparing the results inferred within the irreducible
and reducible procedures (see section 4).

2.4 generalization to arbitrary l

at this point we can generalize the previous results to an arbitrary l in a
simple manner. acting in a way that ensures on the one hand the nilpotency
and acyclicity of the koszul-tate dierential, and on the other hand its
irreducibility, we enlarge the eld and antield spectra, and construct the
koszul-tate complex through

0 = 0, 2k = 0, k = 1,    , a,



0 = 

s0

2k = 0, k = 1,    , a,

2k+2, k = 0,    , b,

(35)

where the 2k s are bosonic with antighost number zero, the 
fermionic, of antighost number one, and the  
number two. in the above, the notations a and b mean

2k s are
2k+1s are bosonic with antighost

from (3335) we get an irreducible theory described by the action

3 the irreducible brst symmetry for re-

ducible gauge theories

the derivation of the irreducible koszul-tate complex from the above sec-
tion suggests the possibility to construct an irreducible brst symmetry
associated with the reducible one. this is why in this section we point out
the derivation of the irreducible brst symmetry corresponding to the ir-
reducible theory derived within the previous section and show that we can
replace the brst quantization of the original reducible system by that of the
irreducible theory. in view of this, we remark that by organizing the elds
(0, 2k ), as well as the gauge parameters (1, 2k+1), into some column
vectors a0, respectively, a1, the gauge transformations (3841) can be writ-
ten in a condensed form as a0 = z a0
a1 is the appropriate
matrix of the gauge generators from (3841) (including a k
k1 and z k1
k ).
an essential requirement that must be satised by the new generators z a0
a1
is their completeness, i.e.,

a1a1, where z a0

(45)

as the completeness of the gauge generators depends in general on the choice
of a k
k1 and also on the reducibility functions of the original theory, in the
sequel we consider only those theories for which (45) hold.

in order to build the irreducible antield brst symmetry it is neces-
sary to construct the irreducible koszul-tate dierential and the irreducible
longitudinal exterior derivative along the gauge orbits. the koszul-tate dif-
ferential was constructed in section 2 (see (3335)). the construction of
the longitudinal exterior dierential along the gauge orbits, d, follows the
general irreducible brst line [6]. by introducing the minimal ghosts

a1 =   1

2k+1 ! ,

of pure ghost number one, the denitions

da0 = z a0

a1a1, da1 =

(46)

(47)

together with (45) ensure the weak nilpotency of d without adding any
ghosts of ghosts. under these circumstances, the homological perturbation

10

theory [14][17] guarantees the existence of the irreducible brst symmetry,
si.

f

in the sequel we show that it is permissible to substitute the brst quan-
tization of the reducible theory by that of the irreducible system derived
previously.
it is obvious that the two theories possess the same classical
observables as the elds (2k )k=1,,a do not appear eectively in the ac-
tion of the irreducible system, such that they are purely gauge variables,
and, in consequence, the observables of the irreducible theory do not depend
on them, such that
2k  0. thus, the observables corresponding to the
irreducible system, f , involve only the elds 0 and should satisfy only
1  0, which are nothing but the equations that must
the equations
be checked by the observables of the reducible theory. as the observables
of the irreducible and reducible theories coincide, it follows that the zeroth
order cohomological groups of the irreducible and reducible brst opera-
tors are isomorphic, h 0 (si) = h 0 (sr). thus, the irreducible and reducible
theories are equivalent from the brst point of view, i.e., from the point
of view of the fundamental equations underlying this formalism, s2 = 0,
h 0 (s) = {physical observables}. all these considerations lead to the conclu-
sion that we can replace the brst quantization of the reducible theory by
that of the irreducible system derived previously.

f

with all the above ingredients at hand, the brst quantization of the
irreducible theory goes along the standard manner. if one denes the canon-
ical action of si through sif = (f, si), with (, ) the antibracket and si the
canonical generator of the irreducible brst symmetry, the nilpotency of si
is expressed by means of the master equation

(si, si) = 0.

(48)

the existence of the solution to the master equation is guaranteed via the
acyclicity of the koszul-tate operator at positive antighost numbers. in order

to solve the master equation we take si =

s! = k,
s! = 0 and approach the master equation (48) antighost by antighost

the ambiguities signalized at the end of section 2 in connection with the
functions a k
induce some ambiguities at the level of the solu-
tion to the master equation, si. the ambiguity in si is completely exhausted
by the possibility to perform a canonical transformation in the antibracket
[6], so the solution is unique up to such a canonical transformation. in or-

der to x the gauge, we add the non-minimal variables (cid:16)b2k+1, b 
(cid:16)2k+1,  

2k+1(cid:17) and
2k+1(cid:17), with k = 0,    , b, such that we obtain the non-minimal solu-

for some functions 2k1 and 2k+3. on account of (5152) it is easy to
show that the gauge conditions (50) are irreducible even if a k+1

thus, a possible class of gauge-xing fermions can be written as

2k+12k+1,

(53)

with 2k+1 given in (50). eliminating the antields from s with the help
of (53), we deduce the gauge-xed action, s, in the standard manner. the
gauge-xing fermion (53) involves (dirac) -functions from the gauge con-
ditions. it is understood that one can shift the gauge conditions by b2k+1
in order to reach some gaussian average representations. because the gauge
conditions are irreducible, the gauge-xed action displays no residual gauge
invariances with respect to the non-minimal sector. of course, one is free to

12

take any consistent irreducible gauge conditions instead of (50). in conclu-
sion, the path integral of the original reducible theory quantized accordingly
our irreducible procedure reads as

z = z da0da1d a1dba1 exp is.

(54)

we remark once again that our procedure does not involve ghosts for ghosts,
i.e., (54) contains only ghost number one ghost elds. this completes the
description of our irreducible treatment for reducible gauge theories.

at this stage, we can emphasize in a clearer manner the role of the newly
added elds, 2k , with k > 0. in our formalism these elds play a double
role, namely, (i) they implement the irreducibility through the gauge transfor-
mations (3941), and (ii) they are involved with the irreducible gauge-xing
procedure. in this light, these elds are more relevant than the correspond-
ing non-minimal ones appearing during the gauge-xing process from the
reducible case because, while the newly introduced elds prevent the appear-
ance of the reducibility, the non-minimal elds (in the reducible situation)
are mainly an eect of the reducibility, and, consequently, are more passive.

4 example: the freedman-townsend model

let us apply the prior investigated irreducible approach in the case of the
freedman-townsend model. we start with the lagrangian action of the
non-abelian freedman-townsend theory [18]

it is easy to see that the new gauge transformations, namely, (56) and (59)
form a complete set, the gauge algebra remaining abelian. this guarantees
the possibility of an appropriate construction of the longitudinal dieren-
tial along the gauge orbits. with these elements at hand, we pass to the
derivation of the gauge-xed action of the irreducible system associated with
the freedman-townsend model. the minimal ghost spectrum contains the

fermionic ghost number one ghosts 1 = (cid:16)b(cid:17), while the minimal antield
b(cid:17), the former an-

spectrum is organized as 
tields having antighost number one and grassmann parity one, while the
latter possess antighost number two and grassmann parity zero. with the
above spectra at hand, the concrete form of the minimal solution to the
master equation reads as

the prior gauge conditions are irreducible and are enforced via a non-minimal
sector of the type (a, ba) plus the corresponding antields. the ghost

numbers (gh) and grassmann parities () of the non-minimal elds read
as gh (a) = 1,  (a) = 1, gh (ba) = 0,  (ba) = 0. the features of
their antields follow from the standard brst rules. thus, the non-minimal
aba.

solution to the master equation is expressed through s = smin +r d4x  
taking the gauge-xing fermion  = r d4x b b, and eliminating as usually

the antields, we arrive at the gauge-xed action

with b given by (61). the symbol [] signies the antisymmetry with

let us investigate now an abelian version of freedman-townsend theory

that is second-stage reducible. we start with the action

(65)

accordingly the general theory, we add the elds b

apart from the spectra in the irreducible setting, in (70) there appear the

the gauge-xed action (71), the elds c 

the non-minimal elds (cid:16) ca, a(cid:17). along the same line, but with respect to

between the variables involved with the gauge-xed actions derived within
the irreducible and reducible approaches, the dierence between the gauge-

we remark that the dierences between the gauge-xed actions are propor-
tional with the ghosts of ghost number greater than one, which are some
essential compounds of the reducible brst quantization. although iden-
tied at the level of the gauge-xed actions, the elds from (7273) play
dierent roles within the two formalisms. more precisely, the presence of the
a prevents the reducibility, while the as, respectively, 
elds a and b
a
represent an eect of the reducibility. in fact, the elds a and b
a are intro-
duced in order to forbid the existence of the zero modes. in consequence, all
the ingredients connected with the zero modes, e.g., the ghosts of ghosts or
the non-minimal pyramid, are discarded from the irreducible setting. in this
light, we suggestively call the elds a and b
a antimodes. this completes
our irreducible treatment.

5 conclusion

to conclude with, in this paper we expose an alternative method of quan-
tizing reducible gauge theories without introducing ghosts of ghosts or their
antields. the cornerstone of our approach is given by the derivation of
a koszul-tate complex underlying an irreducible gauge theory. as the irre-
ducible gauge system possesses the same physical observables like the original
reducible theory, it is legitimate to substitute the brst quantization of the
initial reducible system by that of the irreducible one from the point of view
of the main equations underlying the brst formalism. then, the general
line of the antield brst quantization for the irreducible theory is eluci-
dated, some possible gauge conditions being outlined. the general approach
is nally exemplied in the case of the freedman-townsend model.
