abstract

we illustrate the dirichlet prescription of the ads/cft correspondence using the
example of a massive scalar eld and argue that it is the only entirely consistent regu-
larization procedure known so far. using the dirichlet prescription, we then calculate
the divergent terms for gravity in the cases d = 2, 4, 6, which give rise to the weyl
anomaly in the boundary conformal eld theory.

1 introduction

it has been stated in most papers on this subject that the correspondence between a eld
theory on anti-de sitter space (ads) and a conformal eld theory (cft) on its horizon is
formally described by the formula [1, 2]

z0 d eiads[] =(cid:28)expz ddx 0(x)o(x)(cid:29) ,

(1)

where the functional integral on the left hand side is over all elds , which asymptotically
approach 0 on the ads horizon. on the right hand side, 0 couples as a current to some
boundary conformal eld o. in the classical approximation the left hand side is identical
to exp(i[0]), where i[0] is the on-shell action evaluated as a functional of the boundary
value. thus, the formula (1) enables one to calculate correlation functions of the eld o in
the boundary conformal eld theory. this rather formal identication of partition functions
needs renement due to the fact that i[0] is divergent as a result of the divergence of the
ads metric on the horizon. let us choose the conventional representation of anti de-sitter
space, namely the upper half space x0 > 0, x  rd with the metric

the horizon is given by x0 = 0, but in order to regularize the action one considers the space
restricted to x0 > . the regularized on-shell action will be a function of . moreover, the
terms which diverge in the limit   0 can be isolated and cancelled with counterterms.
the remaining nite result is identied with the right hand side of eqn. (1). there is a
subtlety concerning the proper choice of boundary values, but consistency forces us to use
the boundary values at x0 =  (we call this the dirichlet prescription). this subtlety and
its resolution is illustrated for the example of the massive scalar eld in section 2.

the dirichlet prescription of the ads/cft correspondence has been used to successfully
calculate the two-point functions of scalar elds [1, 3, 4], spinors [5], vector elds [5], rarita
schwinger elds [6] and gravitons [7]. it must be noted that the subtlety mentioned above
aects neither the nite terms in the two-point functions for massless scalar and vector elds,
gravitons, spinors and rarita schwinger elds [2, 8, 9, 10, 11], nor higher point correlators
(cf. [12] and references therein).

more recently, attention has been brought to the divergent contributions, which have to
be cancelled by counterterms [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. of particular importance are
terms, which are logarithmically divergent, since those counterterms are not invariant under
conformal or weyl scaling transformations. hence, the presence of a logarithmic divergence
leads to a conformal or weyl anomaly in the nite part of the action. the weyl anomaly
has recently been calculated for the cases d = 2, 4, 6 [13, 14]. however, the authors of these
papers used a regularization, which does not consistently address the subtlety mentioned
above. therefore, we present in section 3 the calculation of the divergent terms for free
gravity using the dirichlet prescription. our results for the terms relevant to the weyl
anomaly in d = 2, 4, 6 agree with those of [13, 14], but we regard this as a coincidence
particular to gravitons. finally, we urge the reader to consult the appendix for our notation
and for a review of the time slicing formalism, which is used in section 3.

2 the regularization procedure

we illustrate the regularization procedure with the example of the free massive scalar eld,
whose action is given by

and whose equation of motion with the metric (2) is

i =

1

2z dd+1xg(cid:0)dd + m22(cid:1) ,
(cid:2)x2
0  x0(d  1)0  m2(cid:3)  = 0.
where  =rd2

4

+ m2

d

2

0 eikxk(kx0),
x

the solution of eqn. (4), which does not diverge for x0   is given in terms of the mode

(3)

(4)

(6)

(7)

and k is a modied bessel function. let us isolate the leading behaviour for small x0 by
dening

d

(x) = x
2
0



(x).

(5)

then,  has a nite limit as x0 goes to zero. however, one must take care to express the
regularized on-shell action in terms of the boundary value at x0 = . this is easiest done by
using

(x) =(cid:16)x0

 (cid:17)z ddk

(2)d eikx k(kx0)

k(k)

(k),

which satises (x, ) = (x). consider the regularized on-shell action, which is [3]

i() = 

1

2z ddx 2(cid:20)(cid:18)d

2  (cid:19) 2

 +  0

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:21)

the rst term on the right hand side is divergent and must be cancelled with a counterterm.
the second term might contain other divergent terms, but also gives rise to the nite term
[3]

if in = cz ddxddy

(x)(y)

|x  y|d+2 ,

(8)

where c = (d/2 + )/[

d

2 ()].

on the other hand, there appears to be a slightly dierent, and in our view not entirely
consistent, prescription. essentially, it expresses  in terms of the boundary value 0 at
x0 = 0, which can be done by writing

(x) =

21

()z ddk

(2)d eikx(kx0)k(kx0)0(k).

(9)

3

for small x0 this can be expanded as

(x) = 0(x) + x2

0 cz ddy

0(y)

|x  y|d+2 + o(cid:16)x2n

0 , x2(+n)

0

(cid:17) .

substituting eqn. (10) into eqn. (7) one obtains

i = 

1

2z ddx 2(cid:18)d

2  (cid:19) 2
0 

d
2

cz ddxddy

0(x)0(y)

|x  y|d+2 + o(cid:0)2(n), 2n(cid:1) .

obviously, the nite term in eqn. (11) does not agree with eqn. (8), except for d = 2, i.e. for
m = 0. the reason for the discrepancy is that the rst term on the right hand side of eqn.
(7), which is purely divergent in the dirichlet prescription, contributes to the nite term, if
eqn. (9) is used. ignoring this spurious contribution (by including it into the counterterm),
the nite terms coincide. thus, one must accept that counterterms are to be expressed in
terms of , not 0, which is the essence of the dirichlet prescription.

3 divergent terms for gravity

3.1 general formalism

the gravity action is given by [9, 21]

i = z

dd+1xpg(cid:20) r +

d(d  1)

l2

(cid:21) + 2z ddxg (cid:20)h +

d  1

l

(cid:21) ,

(12)

where the cosmological constant has been set equal to 2 = d(d  1)/l2. the last term in
the boundary integral can be considered as the rst counterterm. as for our calculation of
the nite part of the action [7] we use the time slicing formalism, which is summarized in
the appendix. let us choose  = x 0 as time coordinate and use the gauge

n =

l
2

,

ni = 0.

(13)

after isolating the leading behaviour of gij for small  (which can be found from the equation
of motion) by dening

the equation of motion (a.16) becomes

gij =

1


gij,

(14)

(15)

l2 rij + (d  2)g 

ij  2g 

ij + 2gklg 

ikg 

lj  gklg 

kl(cid:0)g 

ij  gij(cid:1) = 0.

here, rij = rij is the ricci tensor of the time slice hypersurface. raising an index with the
metric gij we realize that it is handy to dene the quantity

hi
j = gikg 

kj.

(16)

in fact, eqn. (15) becomes

l2 ri

j + (d  2)hi

j + hi

j  (cid:16)2hi

j



+ hhi

j(cid:17) = 0.

(17)

similarly, rewriting the constraints (a.13) and (a.14) using eqns. (13), (14) and (16) one
obtains

and

respectively.

l2 r + 2(d  1)h + (cid:0)hi
dih  djhj

i = 0,

jhj

i  h2(cid:1) = 0

(18)

(19)

in the ads/cft correspondence we have to calculate the on-shell value of the action
(12) as a functional of prescribed boundary values gij, where the boundary is given by  = .
first, the on-shell action is easily found to be

i() =

d

l z

d ddxpg 1

d

2 +

2

l z ddxpg 

d

2 (h  1).

(20)

in order to nd the singular terms in the limit   0, we dierentiate eqn. (20) with respect
to , leading to

i


=z ddxpg 

d

2 (cid:20)l r +

d  1

l

h(cid:21) .

(21)

we have made use of the trace of the equation of motion (17) in order to simplify this
expression. one can nd the singular terms by calculating h from eqns. (17), (18) and (19)
as a power series in , keeping only terms of order smaller than 
2 . thus, for odd d, eqn.
(21) contains only singular terms proportional to powers n+ 1
2 . on the other hand, for
even d, eqn. (21) contains a term proportional to 1/, which yields a corresponding term
proportional to ln  in i. this logarithmic divergence is the source of the weyl anomaly in
the regularized nite action.

d

3.2 d = 2

there is not really much to do for d = 2. in fact, the divergent term in eqn. (21) is obtained
from the leading order solution for h. using the constraint (18) one nds

h = 
hence, the divergent term in the action is

l2

r + o().

idiv = ln

3.3 d = 4

starting from the constraint (18) one nds

h =

here, the leading order behaviour of the term in parentheses is succient. the equation of

4 conclusions

in this paper, we rst explained the regularization procedure for the ads/cft correspon-
dence. this was done using the example of a massive scalar eld. the regularization proce-
dure involves considering a family of surfaces as space time boundary, which tend towards
the ads horizon for some limit   0. when using the cut-o, one must express all coun-
terterms in terms of the boundary values of the ads elds at the cut-o boundary, not the
asymptotic horizon value. our example demonstrates the importance of this step and thus
shows that the dirichlet prescription is the only entirely consistent one known so far.

then, we calculated the divergent terms for ads gravity for d = 2, 4, 6 using the dirichlet
prescription. we found agreement with earlier results, whose derivation did not properly
address the boundary value subtlety [13], or used dierent techniques [16, 17, 19]. the
fact that the subtlety does not aect the result should be regarded as a coincidence, as in
the other cases mentioned in the introduction. in fact, we calculated some divergent terms
for the scalar eld and found that they generically disagree for the correct and asymptotic
boundary values  even in the massless case, where the nite terms coincide.

as in our calculation of the nite term [7], which yields the two-point function of cft
energy momentum tensors, the time slicing formalism proves a valuable tool for the gravity
part of the ads/cft correspondence. moreover, we found that the calculation was greatly
simplied by considering the derivative of the action, eqn. (21).

a time slicing formalism

let us begin with a review of basic geometric relations for immersed hypersurfaces [22]. let
a hypersurface be dened by the functions x (xi), ( = 0, . . . d, i = 1, . . . d) and let g and
gij be the metric tensors of the imbedding manifold and the hypersurface, respectively. the
tangents ix  and the normal n  of the hypersurface satisfy the following orthogonality
relations:

gix jx  = gij,
ix n = 0,
nn  = 1.

(a.1)
(a.2)
(a.3)

we shall in the sequel use a tilde to label quantities relating to the d + 1 dimensional space
time manifold and leave those relating to the hypersurface unadorned. moreover, we use
the symbol d to denote a covariant derivative with respect to whatever indices may follow.
then, there are the equations of gauss and weingarten, which dene the second fundamental
form hij of the hypersurface,

dijx   ijx  + 
din   in  + 

ix jx   k
ix n  = h j

i jx .

ijkx  = hijn ,

(a.4)

(a.5)

the second fundamental form describes the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface and is
related to the intrinsic curvature by another equation of gauss,

rix jx kx lx  = rijkl + hilhjk  hikhjl.

furthermore, it satises the equation of codazzi,

rix jx n kx  = dihjk  djhik.

(a.6)

(a.7)

in the time slicing formalism [23, 24] we consider the bundle of immersed hypersurfaces
dened by x 0 = const., whose tangent vectors are given by ix 0 = 0 and ix  = 
i
( = 1, . . . d). one conveniently splits up the metric as (shown here for euclidean signature)

g =(cid:18)nini + n2 nj
gij(cid:19) ,

ni

whose inverse is given by

g =

1

n2 (cid:18) 1

ni n2gij + ninj(cid:19)

nj

(a.8)

(a.9)

and whose determinant is g = n2g. the quantities n and ni are called the lapse function and
shift vector, respectively. the normal vector n  satisfying eqns. (a.2) and (a.3) is given by

n = (n, 0),

n  =

1
n

(1, ni),

(a.10)

8

where the sign has been chosen such that the normal points outwards on the boundary
(n > 0 without loss of generality). then, one obtains the second fundamental form from the
equation of gauss (a.4) as

hij =

1
2n

(g 
ij  dinj  djni),

(a.11)

where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the time coordinate (x 0).

the advantage of the time slicing formalism is that one removes the dieomorphism
invariance in einsteins equation by specifying the lapse function n and shift vector ni and
thus obtains an equation of motion as well as constraints for the physical degrees of freedom
gij. consider einsteins equation without matter elds,

r 

1
2

g r = g.

(a.12)

multiplying it with n n  and using the equation of gauss (a.6) as well as the relation (a.3)
one obtains the rst constraint,

r + hijh ij  h 2 = 2,

(a.13)

where h = h i
and the relation (a.2) yields the second constraint,

i . similarly, multiplying with n ix , using the equation of codazzi (a.7)

finally, rewriting eqn. (a.12) in the form

dih  djh j

i = 0.

r =

2

d  1

g

and projecting out its tangential components we obtain the equation of motion

rij =

2

d  1

gij.
