abstract

it is shown that the calogero-moser models based on all root systems of the nite
reection groups (both the crystallographic and non-crystallographic cases) with the
rational (with/without a harmonic conning potential), trigonometric and hyperbolic
potentials can be simply supersymmetrised in terms of superpotentials. there is a uni-
versal formula for the supersymmetric ground state wavefunction. since the bosonic
part of each supersymmetric model is the usual quantum calogero-moser model, this
gives a universal formula for its ground state wavefunction and energy, which is deter-
mined purely algebraically. quantum lax pair operators and conserved quantities for
all the above calogero-moser models are established.

1 introduction

the supersymmetric generalisation of quantum calogero-moser models in terms of super-

potentials is presented. it applies to all of the calogero-moser models based on the crys-

tallographic and non-crystallographic root systems and with the degenerate potentials, i.e.

the rational, hyperbolic and trigonometric potentials. the supersymmetric ground state is

easy to obtain and has zero energy, and we are able to deduce a universal formula for the

ground state wavefunction and ground state energy of the non-supersymmetric models. our

calculations involve the consideration of all the two-dimensional sub-root systems lying in

the original one. historically, the integrability of calogero-moser models [1, 2] was rst

discovered in the quantum mechanical models. as we will show in this paper, the quantum

and classical integrability [3, 4, 5] are very closely related. in this paper, the generic case

with the elliptic potentials will not be discussed. supersymmetrisation and quantisation of

calogero-moser models with elliptic potentials remains a great challenge.

for general background and the motivations for this paper, and for the physical appli-

cations of the calogero-moser models with various potentials to lower-dimensional physics,

ranging from solid state to particle physics and supersymmetric gauge theories, we refer to

our previous papers [3, 4] and references therein.

this paper is organised as follows.

in section 2 we summarise the classical calogero-

moser models to set the stage and introduce appropriate notation. one special property

(2.31) of the lax pair for the models with degenerate potentials is pointed out. this prop-

erty will be essential in constructing the quantum lax pair operators in section 4. in section

3 the supersymmetrisation of quantum calogero-moser models with degenerate potentials

is presented, and we derive the formulas for the ground state wavefunction (3.51) and the

ground state energy (3.42), (3.43) of the non-supersymmetric models. in section 4 we de-

rive quantum lax pair equations (4.22) and (4.23) for the non-supersymmetric models and

deduce the quantum conserved quantities (4.24) and (4.25). section 5 is for comments and

discussion.

2 calogero-moser models

in this section we briey introduce the classical calogero-moser models along with appro-

priate notation and background for the main body of this paper. we consider only the

2

degenerate potentials, that is the rational (with/without harmonic force), hyperbolic and

trigonometric potentials. in these cases the universal lax pair operator [4] without spectral

parameter is drastically simplied and some new features not shared by the most general lax

pair arise. these will become important for the quantum lax pairs and conserved quantities

to be discussed in section 4.

2.1 model

a (generalised) calogero-moser model is a hamiltonian system associated with a root system

 of rank r, which is a set of vectors in rr with its standard inner product, invariant under

reections in the hyperplane perpendicular to each vector in . in other words,

where

s()  ,

,   ,

s() =   2(  /||2).

dual roots are dened by  = 2/||2, in terms of which

s() =   ( ).

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

the set of reections {s,   } generates a group, known as a coxeter group, or nite

reection group. the orbit of    is the set of root vectors resulting from the action of

the coxeter group on it. the set of positive roots + may be dened in terms of a vector
u  rr, with   u 6= 0,   , as those roots    such that   u > 0. given +,
there is a unique set of r simple roots  = {j, j = 1, . . . , r} dened such that they span

the root space and the coecients {aj} in  = pr
the highest root h, for which pr

j=1 ajj for   + are all non-negative.
j=1 aj is maximal, is then also determined uniquely. the
subset of reections {s,   } in fact generates the coxeter group. the products of s,

with   , are subject solely to the relations

(ss)m(,) = 1,

,   .

(2.4)

the interpretation is that ss is a rotation in some plane by 2/m(, ). the set of positive

integers m(, ) (with m(, ) = 1,   ) uniquely specify the coxeter group.

the root systems for nite reection groups may be divided into two types: crystal-

lographic and non-crystallographic. crystallographic root systems satisfy the additional

3

condition

   z,

,   ,

(2.5)

which implies that the z-span of  is a lattice in rr and contains all roots in . these root

systems are associated with simple lie algebras: {ar, r  1}, {br, r  2}, {cr, r  2},

{dr, r  4}, e6, e7, e8, f4 and g2, and also {bcr, r  2} which combines the root systems

br and cr. the coxeter groups for these root systems are called weyl groups. the remaining

non-crystallographic root systems [6] are h3, h4, whose coxeter groups are the symmetry

groups of the icosahedron and four-dimensional 600-cell, respectively, and the dihedral group

of order 2m, {i2(m), m  4}.

the dynamical variables of the calogero-moser model are the coordinates {qj} and their

canonically conjugate momenta {pj}, with the poisson brackets

{qj, pk} = jk,

{qj, qk} = {pj, pk} = 0,

j, k = 1, . . . , r.

(2.6)

these will be denoted by vectors in rr

q = (q1, . . . , qr),

p = (p1, . . . , pr).

the hamiltonian for the classical calogero-moser model is

hc =

1
2

p2 +

1

2 x+

g2
||||2 v (  q),

(2.7)

(2.8)

in which the real positive coupling constants g|| are dened on orbits of the corresponding

coxeter group, i.e. they are identical for roots in the same orbit. that is, for the simple

lie algebra cases g|| = g for all roots in simply-laced models and g|| = gl for long roots

and g|| = gs for short roots in non-simply laced models. for the bcr models there are

three couplings, and in the i2(m) models, there is one coupling if m is odd, and two if m

is even (see section 3). the h3 and h4 models have one coupling constant g|| = g, since
these root systems are simply-laced. (exhibiting the factor ||2, rather than absorbing it

into the coupling constant, is a convenience.) this then ensures that for any potential v ,

the hamiltonian is invariant under reection of the phase space variables in the hyperplane

perpendicular to any root

with s dened by (2.3).

p  s(p),

  

(2.9)

the lax pair operators that we will introduce will apply for the following degenerate

potentials:

v (  q) =

1/(  q)2,

a2/sinh2 a(  q),

a2/sin2 a(  q),

(2.10)



in which a is an arbitrary real positive constant, determining the period of the trigono-

metric potentials (and the imaginary period in the hyperbolic case, although this has less

signicance). they imply integrability for all of the calogero-moser models based on the

crystallographic root systems. those models based on the non-crystallographic root systems,

the dihedral group i2(m), h3, and h4, are integrable only for the rational potential. the

rational potential models are also integrable if a conning harmonic potential

1
2

2q2,  > 0

(2.11)

is added to the hamiltonian.

some remarks are in order. for all of the root systems and for any choice of potential
(2.10), the calogero-moser model has a hard repulsive potential  1/(  q)2 near the reec-

tion hyperplane h = {q  rr,   q = 0}. the strength of the singularity is given by the
coupling constant g2

|| which is independent of the choice of the normalisation of the roots.
this determines the form of the ground state wave function in the quantum version of the

theory, as we will see in section 3. the repulsive potential is classically insurmountable.

thus the motion is always conned within one weyl chamber. this feature allows us to

constrain the conguration space to the principal weyl chamber

p w = {q  rr|   q > 0,   },

(2.12)

without loss of generality. in the case of the trigonometric potential, the conguration space

is further limited due to the periodicity of the potential to

p wt = {q  rr|   q > 0,   , h  q < /a},

(2.13)

where h is the highest root.

2.2 lax pair

here we recapitulate the essence of the universal lax pair operators for the calogero-moser

models with degenerate potentials and without spectral parameter. for details and a full

5

exposition, see [4]. the lax operators are

x = i x+

g|| (  h) x(  q) s,

g||||2 y(  q) s,

l = p  h + x,

fm =

i

2 x+

(2.14)

(2.15)

in which {s,   } are the reection operators of the root system. they act on a set of rr
vectors r = {(k)  rr, k = 1, . . . , d}, permuting them under the action of the reection

group. the vectors in r form a basis for the representation space v of dimension d. the

simplest and the most natural representation spaces of the lax pair operators are provided

by the set of all roots  for the simply-laced root systems, and the set of short roots s or

the set of long roots l for non-simply laced root systems. these give root type lax pairs,

[3]. another class of simple representations are the so-called minimal type representations,

for which r consists of the weights belonging to a minimal representation, and which give

minimal type lax pairs [3].

the set of operators { hj, j = 1, . . . , r} are dened as follows. if hj acts on a vector

(k)  r, the j-th component is returned:

hj(k) = (k)

j (k).

these, along with the reection operators, form the following operator algebra:

[ hj, hk] = 0,
[ hj, s] = j( h)s,

ss s = ss(),

(ss)m(,) = 1.

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

the rst relation (2.16) implies that the operators { hj, j = 1, . . . , r} form an abelian subal-
gebra and relations (2.18) and (2.19) are just those for the nite reection group associated

with the root system . the set of integers m(, ) are those appearing in the coxeter

relations (2.4) which characterise the reection group.

the form of the function x depends on the chosen potential, and the function y and

another function w to be used in section 3 are dened by

y(u) 

d
du

x(u),

dw(u)

du

/w(u)  x(u).

(2.20)

6

they have denite parities:

x(u) = x(u),

y(u) = y(u), w(u) = w(u),

(2.21)

so that l and fm are independent of the choice of positive roots +. this also implies that

the sums in (2.14), (2.15) may be extended to a sum over all roots if an additional factor

of 1/2 is included in front of the sums since the summands are even under   . the

functions x and y are further related to each other, and to the potential function v occurring

in the hamiltonian via

v (u) = y(u) = x2(u) + a2 

0 rational

1 hyperbolic

1 trigonometric.

(2.22)

note that these relations are only valid for the degenerate potentials (2.10) and in the

lax pair without spectral parameter. the following table 1 gives these functions for each

potential:

table 1: functions appearing in the lax pair and superpotential.

the underlying idea of the lax operator l, (2.14), is quite simple. as seen from (2.29), l is

a square root of the hamiltonian. thus one part of l contains p which is not associated

with roots and another part contains x(  q), a square root of the potential v (  q), which

being associated with a root  is therefore accompanied by the reection operator s.

it is straightforward to show that the lax equation

which divides into two parts as

d
dt

is equivalent to the canonical equations of motion:

d
dt

l = [l, fm ],
x = [p  h, fm ],
(p  h) = [x, fm ],

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

for the details of the proof, see [4]. it is amusing to note that the lax equation is rather
symmetric in x  p  h. in section 4 we will discuss the quantum version of these equations.

it is well-known that conserved quantities are given in terms of a representation r of the

operator l as

tr(ln)  xr

(ln), n = 1, 2, . . . ,

(2.28)

in which s are the basis vectors of the representation r. in particular, the classical hamil-

tonian (2.8) is given by

hc =

1

2cr

tr(l2) + const,

(2.29)

where the constant cr, which depends on the representation, is dened by

tr( hj hk)  xr

( hj hk) = xr

jk = cr jk.

(2.30)

before closing this section let us remark on one special property of a representation matrix

of the lax operator fm :

xr fm = xr fm = id 

i

2 x+

g||||2 y(  q) = 

i

2 x+

g||||2 v (  q).

(2.31)

the quantity d is independent of the representation r. thus we can dene a new lax

operator m by

which satises the relation

m = fm + id  i,

i : identity operator,

xr

m = xr

m = 0.

the new lax pair l and m gives the same classical equations of motion as above. the above

property (2.33) has been known for the ar model lax pair in the vector representation [8].

we stress that this is a universal property shared by all of the lax matrices without spectral

parameter for the degenerate potentials in any representation. the reason is that the 

matrix element of the fm operator (2.15) reads

fm =

i

2 x+

g||||2 y(  q) (s),

in which

(s) = ,s() = ,s().

8

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

(2.35)

since s() (s()) is always contained in the basis of the representation precisely once,

xr

(s) = xr

(s) = 1

(2.36)

and so (2.31) is obtained. this also means that for  6= , fm is either 0 or it consists of a

single term (two terms in the bcr case). for suppose two positive roots  and  connect 

and , then we obtain

 = s() =   ( )

= s() =   ( ).

this would imply    which then means  =  ( = 2 or  = 2 in the bcr case) since

both are positive roots. the diagonal element fm contains contributions from all of the

roots which are orthogonal to .

2.2.1 rational potential with harmonic force

here we give the lax pair for the rational potential model with harmonic force. the hamil-

tonian is

hc =

1
2

p2 +

1
2

2q2 +

1

2 x+

g2
||

||2
(  q)2 .

(2.37)

the canonical equations of motion are equivalent to the following lax equations for l:

in which (see section 4 of [4]) fm is the same as before (2.15), and l and q are dened by

l = l  iq, q = q  h,

l = [l, fm ]  il,

(2.38)

(2.39)

with l, h as earlier. if we dene hermitian operators l1 and l2 by

l1 = l+l, l2 = ll+,

they satisfy lax-like equations

from these we can construct conserved quantities

lk = [lk, fm ],

k = 1, 2.

tr(ln

1 ) = tr(ln

2 ), n = 1, 2, . . . ,

9

(2.40)

(2.41)

(2.42)

as before. it is elementary to check that the rst conserved quantities give the hamiltonian

(2.37)

tr(l1) = tr(l2)  hc + const.

(2.43)

as in the other cases, the operator fm can be replaced by m, (2.32), without changing the

classical equations of motion. this then completes the presentation of the lax pairs for all

of the classical calogero-moser models with non-elliptic potentials.

3 supersymmetrisation

3.1 superpotential and hamiltonian

in this section we show that all the calogero-moser models with degenerate potentials sum-

marised in the previous section can be simply supersymmetrised in terms of superpotentials.

the result is a quantum system with bosonic and fermionic variables. there are some pio-

neering works on supersymmetric calogero-moser models with degenerate potentials, mainly

those based on ar and other classical root systems [7, 8, 9]. we shall not consider here the

classical supersymmetric calogero-moser models, which have dynamical variables taking

values in a grassmann algebra, although these are interesting too.

the bosonic variables have, as before, 2r degrees of freedom:

q = (q1, . . . , qr),

p = (p1, . . . , pr),

(3.1)

with the canonical commutation relations

[qj, pk] = ijk,

[qj, qk] = [pj, pk] = 0,

j, k = 1, . . . , r.

(3.2)

the corresponding n = 2 supersymmetric quantum mechanical system requires additionally

as many fermionic degrees of freedom:

 = (1, . . . , r),

with the canonical anti-commutation relations

 = (

1, . . . , 

r ),

j k + k


j = jk,

jk + kj = 

j 

k + 

k

j = 0,

(3.3)

j, k = 1, . . . , r.

(3.4)

the bosonic and fermionic variables commute with each other:

[qj, k] = [qj, 

k] = [pj, k] = [pj, 

k] = 0,

j, k = 1, . . . , r.

(3.5)

10

we realize these variables as operators in the standard way, as acting on wavefunctions which

lie in the tensor product of the hilbert space of functions of q and a 2r-dimensional fermionic

fock space. the momentum operator pj acts as

pj = i


qj

,

j = 1, . . . , r.

the fermionic variables  and  are respectively annihilation and creation operators, which

are hermitian conjugates of each other. the bosonic variables q will be restricted by the

potential in the same way as in the classical models to lie in the regions (2.12) or (2.13).

the dynamics of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system is determined by a su-
perpotential [10] w (q) = w (q1, . . . , qr)  r. the two supercharges q and q are dened

by

j  pj + i



w

qj ! ,

q =

rxj=1

q =

rxj=1

j pj  i

w

qj ! ,

and the supersymmetric hamiltonian is given by

hsu sy =

1
2

(qq + qq) ,

which is obviously positive semi-denite. they satisfy

q2 = q2 = 0,

[hsu sy , q] = [hsu sy , q] = 0.

in terms of the superpotential, hsu sy reads

hsu sy =

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

note the ordering of the fermionic variables in hf , which is responsible for the last term in

hb. the calogero-moser dynamics is specied by the following choice of the superpotential

w (q) = x+

g|| ln |w(  q)| + (


2

q2),

11

g|| > 0,  > 0,

(3.13)

in which the function w is dened by (2.20) (see also table 1), and the last term corresponds

to the harmonic conning potential in the rational potential model, if present. it should be

remarked that this superpotential is coxeter-invariant:

sw = w,

  ,

in which the new reection operator s acts on a function f of q as follows

(sf )(q) = f (s(q)).

we show that the bosonic part, hb of hsu sy , (3.11), can be written as follows:

hb = hc + hqc  e0.

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

here hc is the classical hamiltonian (2.8), interpreted as a quantum operator, and hqc is

the quantum correction term derived from the last term of (3.11):

hqc =

)

g||||2 v (  q) + (

r
2

),

g||||2 v (  q) = d.

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

in deriving (3.18) from (3.17), the relation (2.22) is used, and recall d is dened by (2.31).

the constant r/2 becomes a part of the constant e0, which is the ground state energy of

the bosonic hamiltonian hc + hqc, since we shall see that both hsu sy and hf annihilate

the ground state, so hb must do so too.

in order to show (3.16) we need to evaluate pj (w/qj)2. firstly we have

w
qj

= x+

g||

w(  q)
w(  q)

j + (qj) = x+

g||x(  q) j + (qj)

so

xj  w

g2
||||2 x(  q)2 + (2q2)

g||g||(  ) x(  q) x(  q) + (2x+

g|| x(  q)  q).(3.20)

the rst line of (3.20) gives the potential terms of the classical hamiltonian (2.8) up to a

constant. secondly we show that the terms in the second line of (3.20) sum up to a constant

12

depending on the root system and the choice of potential. the terms proportional to 

exist only for the rational potential x(u) = 1/u and thus they give rise to a constant solely

determined by the root system:

 2x+

g|| x(  q)(  q) = 2x+

g||  1 =  (

gn

simply-laced,

gsns + glnl non-simply laced,

(3.21)

in which n is the total number of roots in  and ns (nl) is the number of short (long)

roots in .

the main task is to evaluate

x,+

6=

g||g||(  ) x(  q) x(  q),

(3.22)

where each distinct pair of roots gives two equal contributions. this we do by decomposing

it into two-dimensional planes specied by two roots  and :

f(q) =

x6=+, r=ss

g||g||(  ) x(  q) x(  q).

(3.23)

this quantity must be evaluated for a xed sense of rotation r = ss and all roots

appearing in it are in the two-dimensional sub-root system  = {,   (  span(, )}

with positive roots +    +. there is a reverse rotation r = ss in the same plane

which gives the same contribution as f(q) as it is obtained by   . the roots belonging

to each two-dimensional plane constitute the positive roots of a two-dimensional sub-root

system of the original set of roots . the only possible two-dimensional root systems are

a1  a1, a2, b2, g2, and i2(m). table 2 shows the two-dimensional sub-root systems

appearing in the root systems of nite reection groups. the a1  a1 root system has been

omitted since its corresponding quantity (3.23) is always zero. it should be stressed that

the quantities f are determined by the two-dimensional sub-root systems only and not by

where they are embedded in the entire root system.

let us evaluate them in order. we rst consider the a2 sub-root system with  and 

simple roots, which are of the same length. thus the coupling dependence factorises and we

obtain

2fa2(q)/(g2||2) =

x(( + )  q) x(  q) + x(  q) x(( + )  q)

x(  q) x(  q).

the g2 root system consists of six long roots and six short roots, and the sets of long

the ground state energy e0 in (3.16) depends on the root system  and the choice of the

potential v . it has two terms

e0 = e1 + e2.

(3.35)

the former, e1, comes from the diagonal part coming from the dierence of x2 in (3.20) and

v (see (2.22)) and the additional term in (3.17) and (3.21):

is the same one that guarantees the consistency of the classical lax equation (2.23) [4].

the same mechanism plays an important role in the consistency of the quantum conserved

quantities, as we shall see in section 4.

3.2 vacuum or ground state

supersymmetric quantum mechanics provides the easiest way to construct the supersymmet-

ric vacuum, which also gives the ground state energy and eigenfunction of the pure bosonic

theory. the supersymmetric vacuum state |vaci is annihilated by the supercharges

q|vaci = q|vaci = 0,

therefore it is an eigenstate of the supersymmetric hamiltonian with zero energy

hsu sy |vaci = 0.

(3.46)

(3.47)

in order to express |vaci explicitly, let us introduce the state |0i which is annihilated by all

of the fermionic annihilation operators:

let us suppose that

j|0i = 0,

j = 1, . . . , r.

|vaci = 0(q)|0i,

(3.48)

(3.49)

in which 0(q) is yet to be determined. then it satises q|vaci = 0 trivially. the other
condition q|vaci = 0 is fullled if 0 satises

 pj + i

w

qj ! 0 = 0,

j = 1, . . . , r.

(3.50)

a solution of (3.50) is given simply by

|w(  q)|g|| e 

2 q2

,

(3.51)

0(q) = ew (q) = y+

18

which is real and coxeter invariant (3.14). the exponential factor e 

2 q2 exists only for the

rational potential case with the harmonic conning force.

by substituting the above solution (3.51) into (3.47) and using the decomposition of the

supersymmetric hamiltonian (3.10) together with

hf |vaci = 0,

we obtain from hb|vaci = 0

1

p2 +

2 x+

g||(g||  1)||2 v (  q) + (

q2) ew = e0 ew .

(3.52)

in other words, the above solution (3.51) provides a ground state with energy e0 of the pure

bosonic model with hamiltonian hc + hqc.

it should be stressed that e0 is determined

purely algebraically using (3.35)(3.39), without really applying the operator on the left

hand side of (3.52) to the solution. in fact, one would need essentially the same calculation

as above to show that ew is an eigenstate by direct application of the hamiltonian operator.

supersymmetry provides the simplest means to assert that it is the ground state. this type

of ground state has been known for some time. it is derived by various methods, see for

example [1, 2], and also by using supersymmetric quantum mechanics for the models based

on classical root systems [7, 8]. needless to say, our solution (3.51) provides a universal

ground state solution for all the models considered in this paper.

the other states of the bosonic models can be obtained as eigenfunctions of a dierential

operator fhb obtained from hb by a similarity transformation:

fhb = ew hb ew

obviously we have

fhb =   hb  ew =  ew .

zp w (p wt )

e2w (q) dq =(  : rational and hyperbolic

nite : trigonometric and rational with the harmonic potential,

(3.55)

in which p w and p wt denote that the integration is over the regions dened in (2.12)

and (2.13). it should be remarked that the ground state wavefunctions and ground state

19

energies in the non-normalisable cases (i.e.

the rational and hyperbolic potentials and,

in particular, the negative ground state energy of the latter) should not be taken at face
value. in the rational (hyperbolic) case the wavefunction 0(q) = ew (q) diverges polynomially
(exponentially) for h q  +. a similar and better-known situation arises in the quantum
mechanics of a free particle in one-dimension: h = p2/2. it has an exponential eigenstate

with a negative energy:

h0(q) = 

k2
2

0(q), 0(q) = ekq,

k  r.

naturally, most existing results in quantum calogero-moser models are for the models

with normalisable states. there are also some results for the rational and hyperbolic models

[1, 11, 12]. we will not discuss the eigenstates and spectra of (3.54) further. in the rest of

this paper we will concentrate on the integrability structure of the quantum pure bosonic

system (3.40).

4 quantum lax pair operators

in this section we present the formulation of the quantum lax pair operators, which enables

us to construct the quantum conserved quantities for the calogero-moser models based on all

of the root systems (crystallographic and non-crystallographic) and for all of the degenerate

potentials, as in the classical case given in section 2. we believe such a universal construction

of the quantum calogero-moser lax pair is new. we will write down the quantum equations

of motion of the calogero-moser models in an equivalent matrix form, whose matrix elements

are quantum operators. surprisingly the dierence between the classical and quantum lax

pair operators is very small, as we will see below.

the lax pair operators for classical calogero-moser models imply the quantum equa-

tions of motion, if they are interpreted as quantum operators. we start from the classical

hamiltonian

hc =

1
2

p2 +

1

2 x+

g2
||||2 v (  q),

(4.1)

and consider its action as the quantum evolution operator. this is not at all strange, since the

solvable hamiltonians of the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom are the same at the

classical and quantum levels. the canonical equations of motion and quantum heisenberg

20

equations of motion are formally identical:

q = {q, hc} = i[hc, q] = p,

p = {p, hc} = i[hc, p] = 

1

2 x+

g2
||||2 v (  q) .

(4.2)

(4.3)

as shown in section 2, the classical equations of motion are equivalent to the lax form (2.23)

which is divided into two parts as

d
dt

l = [l, fm ],

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

d
dt

x = [p  h, fm ],
(p  h) = [x, fm ].

d
dt

the second equation (4.6) corresponds to (4.3). since only the q operators appear on the

right hand side of (4.6), the quantum commutator [x, fm ] is the same as the classical one,

depending only on the matrix structure. we still have to consider the rst equation (4.5)

which could be dierent from the classical one when p and q are non-commuting. for this

purpose, let us evaluate dx(  q)/dt quantum mechanically:

x(  q)

d
dt

1

= i [hc, x(  q)] = ihp2/2, x(  q)i
2(cid:16) (p  ) y(  q) + y(  q) (p  )(cid:17) ,

=

in which x = y is used. the right hand side is weyl (symmetrically) ordered.

next let us evaluate the matrix element

[p  h, fm ] =p  h, (i/2) x+

g|| ||2 y(  q) s

, ,   r

quantum mechanically. we nd

[p  h, fm ]
= (p  h)(i/2) x+
= (i/2) x+

g||||2 y(  q) s  (i/2) x+

g||||2  p  s() y(  q)  y(  q)p  ! (s).

g||||2 y(  q) s (p  h)

21

(4.7)

(4.8)

note that

s() =   ( ),

p  s() = p    ( )p  ,

and it is easy to see that

p  (i/2) x+
= (1/2) x+

g||||2 y(  q)  (i/2) x+

g||||2 y(  q)   .

g||||2 y(  q) p  

thus we arrive at

[p  h, fm]
= (1/2) x+

g||||2   i( )(p  ) y(  q) + y(  q)   ! (s).

(4.9)

(4.10)

at this point we split p   = (1/2)p   + (1/2)p   and apply the second momentum operator

to the function y

thus we arrive at

(p  ) y(  q) = i||2 y(  q) + y(  q) (p  ).

(4.11)

[p  h, fm]
= i/4 x+
+ x+

g||||2( )  (p  ) y(  q) + y(  q)(p  )!
g||(cid:16)    ||2/4 +   /2(cid:17) y(  q) (s).

the second line vanishes, since  = 2/||2. by using the formulas

 s() =  (  ( )) =  ,

  = 2,

we obtain

(4.12)

g||(  s())  (p  ) y(  q) + y(  q)(p  )! (s)
g||(  h)  (p  ) y(  q) + y(  q)(p  )! (s)

g||(  h)

d
dt

x(  q)s

[p  h, fm ]
= i/2 x+
= i/2 x+
= i x+

=

d
dt

x = i[hc, x].

(4.13)

22

thus we have established that the rst lax equation has the same form at the quantum

and classical levels:

d
dt

x = i[hc, x] = [p  h, fm ]

and that the quantum lax equation as a whole has the same form as the classical one

(4.14)

or to be more precise

(4.15)

,   r.

(4.16)

d
dt

l = i[hc, l] = [l, fm ]
i[hc, l] = xr(cid:16)lfm  fml(cid:17) ,
(cid:17)  il
] = xr(cid:16)l

fm  fml

similarly we obtain for the rational model with the harmonic force

i[hc, l

,

,   r.

(4.17)

from these it is straightforward to derive (recalling the denitions (2.40))

d
dt
d
dt

ln

ln = i[hc, ln] = [ln, fm ], n = 1, 2, . . . ,

k = i[hc, ln

k] = [ln

k = 1, 2, n = 1, 2, . . . .

(4.18)

(4.19)

k, fm ],

however, the parallelism between the classical and quantum lax equations ends here. these

equations do not imply that trln and trln

k are conserved. this is because the matrix

elements of the quantum l and fm operators do not commute and the cyclicity of the matrix

trace is broken.

the remedy is simple. we adopt the bosonic hamiltonian hb (3.40) obtained from the

superpotential in the previous section and the lax pair l and m instead of l and fm . the

quantum lax bracket

[l, m] = [l, fm + id  i] = [l, fm ] + [p  h, id  i]

is dierent from the classical one, since the last term is no longer vanishing:

(4.20)

[p  h, id  i] =

1

2 x+

g||||2 v (  q)   h.

(4.21)

23

this term provides the necessary dierence between the equations of motion of hc and hb.

thus we have established for the hamiltonian hb

d
dt

d
dt

(ln) = i[hb, (ln)] = [ln, m]

= xr  (ln)m  m(ln)! , n = 1, . . . ,

(4.22)

(ln

k) = i [hb, (ln

k)] = [ln

k , m] ,

k = 1, 2, n = 1, 2, . . . .

(4.23)

the above equations are operator equations, therefore they are valid for any calogero-moser

models with any potentials and any representations of the lax pairs.

we dene quantum conserved quantities as the total sum (ts) of all matrix elements of

ln (ln

k, k = 1, 2):

qn = ts(ln)  x,r
k)  x,r

n = ts(ln

q,k

(ln), n = 1, . . . ,

(ln

k),

k = 1, 2, n = 1, . . . .

(4.24)

(4.25)

they are conserved thanks to the property of the m operator (2.33):

xr

m = xr

m = 0.

such quantum conserved quantities have been previously reported for some models based

on ar root systems [8, 21].
ts(ln

2 ) is no longer the same as
1 ) due to quantum corrections. as we will show at the end this section, the quantum

it should be remarked that ts(ln

hamiltonian ts(l2) diers from ts(l1) by a constant.

next we show that the quantum hamiltonian hb is obtained by taking the total sum of

l2 in a representation r:

hb  ts(l2).

this is a necessary condition for the internal consistency of the quantum lax pair operator

formalism. we start from

l2 =(cid:16)p  h(cid:17)2

+(cid:16)p  hx + x p  h(cid:17) + x 2.

for the diagonal operator h, ts and tr are the same and the rst term, (p  h)2, gives as in
the classical theory p2cr. the next term reads

p  hx + x p  h

24

= p  hi x+
= x+
+i x+

g|| (  h) x(  q) s +i x+
g||x(  q)(  h)(cid:16)(p  h) s + s (p  h)(cid:17) .

g||y(  q)(  h)2s

g|| (  h) x(  q) s p  h

(4.26)

here, the rst term on the right hand side of (4.26) gives the same expression as hqc, (3.18),

as we have

x,r(cid:16)(  h)2s(cid:17)

=x,

(  )2(s) =x

(  )2 = cr||2,

(4.27)

in which the formula pr(s) = 1, (2.36), is used. the second sum in (4.26) vanishes,

since we have

x,    h(cid:16)p  h s + sp  h(cid:17)!
=x,
= x

  s()(cid:16) p  s() + p  (cid:17) (s)

= 0,

(  ) p  (2  ( )) = cr(2  p +    p)

(4.28)

in which (2.36) is used again. finally we show that tsx 2 =trx 2, which is rather non-trivial
since the o-diagonal terms (x 2) are generally non-vanishing:

in which

(x 2) = x,

g||g||x(  q)x(  q)(cid:16)  h s   h s(cid:17)

,

(cid:16)  h s   h s(cid:17)

=   (s())    (ss).

since p(ss) = 1 for  =  and  6= , we obtain
x,(cid:16)  h s   h s(cid:17)
(x 2) = crx,

x,r

hence

= cr  ,

g||g||(  )x(  q)x(  q),

(4.29)

(4.30)

(4.31)

which is proportional to the (w/q)2 term in (3.20). thus we have established the an-

nounced result for the models without the harmonic potential:

1

2cr

ts(l2) = hb =

1
2

p2 +

1

2 x+

25

g||(g||  1)||2 v (  q)  e0.

(4.32)

it should be emphasised that the mechanism which ensures the equality tsx 2=trx 2 is the

same one which allows the introduction of supersymmetry in section 3.

finally we establish that the hamiltonian of the rational model with the harmonic po-

tential is obtained in a similar way. to do this, we show that

hb  x,r

(l+l) = x,r

(ll+) + const,

(4.33)

in which

we have

and

l = l  iq, q = q  h.

ll = (l  iq)(l  iq)

= l2 + 2q2  i(ql  lq),

(4.34)

ql  lq = q(p  h + x)  (p  h + x)q

= i hj hkjk + qx  xq.

the second term is the same as in the classical theory

qx  xq = i x+

g||(  h)( h)s.

(4.35)

(4.36)

thus we arrive, using (4.34), at

which conrms (4.33). the constant term is the ground state energy (3.43).

5 comments and discussion

in this paper we have established in an elementary way how all of the calogero-moser models

with degenerate potentials can be supersymmetrised. as a by-product, universal formulas for

the ground state energies and wavefunctions of the original (i.e. non-supersymmetric) quan-

tum calogero-moser models are obtained. we have also given quantum lax pair operators

for these models and derived quantum conserved quantities. these results would constitute

26

a good starting point for the systematic study of quantum calogero-moser models, in par-

ticular, those based on the exceptional and non-crystallographic root systems. besides the

seminal work by dunkl on the models based on the dihedral groups [11], there are many

works on the quantum g2 model, the exceptional calogero-moser model with the fewest (i.e.

2) degrees of freedom [13] and some on the h3 and f4 models [14]. one advantage of our

formulation is its universality and another is that it is independent of any specic choice of

the realisation of the root systems.

another merit of constructing quantum conserved quantities in terms of quantum lax

operators is that it becomes obvious that these conserved quantities are operators acting on

functions in the conguration space, that is, either a weyl chamber (2.12) or a weyl alcove

(2.13). the quantum theory we are discussing is the so-called rst quantised theory. that is,

the notion of identical particles and the associated statistics is non-existent. the symmetry

properties of quantum solutions with respect to the action of the reection operators will be

discussed elsewhere.

for technical reasons, we have not developed the corresponding theory of commuting

dierential operators for these models [15, 16, 17, 18]. as is well-known, the theory of

commuting dierential operators would provide another method for constructing quantum

conserved quantities. analysis of the spectrum and eigenfunctions of calogero-moser models

based on commuting dierential operators [19, 20, 21], shape-invariance [18, 22, 23, 24] and

quantum lax pairs will be published elsewhere.
