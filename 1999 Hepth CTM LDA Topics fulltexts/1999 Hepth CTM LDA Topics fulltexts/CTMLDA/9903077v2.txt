the one-loop uv divergent structure of u (1) yang-mills theory

on noncommutative ir4

we show that u(1) yang-mills theory on noncommutative ir4 can be renormalized
at the one-loop level by multiplicative dimensional renormalization of the coupling
constant and elds of the theory. we compute the beta function of the theory
and conclude that the theory is asymptotically free. we also show that the weyl-
moyal matrix dening the deformed product over the space of functions on ir4 is
not renormalized at the one-loop level.

field theories on noncommutative spaces may play an important role in unraveling the
properties of nature at the planck scale [1,2]. yang-mills theories on the noncommutative
torus occur in compactications of m-theory [2] and there is already a good many papers
where m-theory on noncommutative tori has been studied [3]. still, it has not been estab-
lished yet that these eld theories are well-dened at the quantum level. although a few
initial steps were taken in ref. [1] (see also [4]) the very denition of quantum eld theory
over noncommutative spaces (the analog of the standard wightman-osterwalder-schrader
axioms, scattering theory, ...) is yet to be stated. quantum field theories on fuzzy spheres
[5] had been studied previously and its uv niteness established [6]. here the number of
quantum degrees of freedom is nite and hence it seems that the quantum theory exists.
this is not clear at all for eld theories over noncommutative spaces such as the noncom-
mutative ir4 [7], the noncommutative 3-tori [8] or the noncommutative plane [9]. in these
cases the quantum eld theory has uv divergences and there remains the question whether
this theories are renormalizable. it should be noticed that for the theories at hand the
interaction terms in fourier space are no longer polynomials in the momenta, and hence
that the renormalization program (either perturbative or non-perturbative) works cannot
be taken for granted.

the purpose of this article is to analyze the one-loop uv divergent structure of the
simplest pure gauge theory over the noncommutative ir4. this theory is a u (1) theory
but it is not a free theory due to the noncommutative character of the base space. indeed,
now the eld strength (curvature) is no longer linear in the gauge eld (connection), but

it contains an antisymmetric quadratic contribution as well, for the product of functions is
commutative no longer. the theory with classical action given by the yang-mills functional
turns out to be an interacting theory.

the noncommutative ir4 is dened as the algebra generated by four hermitian ele-

ments x,  = 1, 2, 3, 4, which verify the equation

[x, x] = iq ,

where q is a real constant antisymmetric matrix of rank 4. equations over the non-
commutative ir4 can be represented as equations over a deformation of the c  algebra
c(ir4) of continuous complex-valued functions over ir4 vanishing at innity [10]. this
deformation is given by the the weyl product

(f  g)(x) = z z

d4q
(2)4

d4p
(2)4

ei  qp f (q)g(p).

here f (q) and q(p) are, respectively, the fourier transforms of f (x) and g(x), and  
1
2 (q1) is a constant antisymmetric matrix of rank four. conness noncommutative
geometry formalism gives mathematical rigour to the concept of classical u (1) gauge eld
over such a noncommutative space [11,12]. this gauge eld is provided by a real vector
function, a(x), on ir4. the eld strength, f (x), for this gauge eld reads now

f (x) = a   a + i{a, a}(x),

where {a, a}(x) = (a  a)(x)  (a  a)(x) is the moyal bracket.

the classical u (1) eld theory over noncommutative ir4 is given by the yang-mills

functional

sy m =

1

4g2 z (f  f )(x),

(1)

where f (x) is given above. this action is invariant under gauge transformations which
have the following innitesimal form a(x) =  + i{a, }(x).

the next task to tackle is the construction of a quantum eld theory whose classical
counterpart is the previous theory. what we mean by a quantum eld theory over a
noncommutative space is by no means obvious, e.g. what mathematical objects dene the
quantum physics has not been properly established yet (see ref. [9] for discussions on this
point). in this paper we shall assume that the quantum theory is dened by the green
functions of the theory, i.e. by the generating functional

z[j] = n z d(x)es+r d4xj(x)(x)  n esint[



j (x) ]exp(cid:0)

1

2 z z d4xd4yj(x)p (x  y)j(y)(cid:1),

where  denotes generically the elds of the theory and p (x  y) denotes the inverse
of the kinetic term (quadratic in the elds) in s. s and sint denote, respectively, the
classical action over the noncommutative space in question and the interaction terms in in
s. the previous denition of z[j] is to be understood as a formal expansion in terms of
feynman diagrams.

2

since our yang-mills action is invariant under gauge transformations its kinetic term
has no inverse and a gauge-xing term has to be introduced. we shall do this in a consistent
way by using the brs formalism. let us introduce the ghost elds c and c, the gauge-
xing eld b and dene the brs transformations as follows

sa(x) = dc(x) = c(x) + i{a, c}(x), sc(x) = b, sb(x) = 0, sc(x) = (c  c)(x).

to keep track of the renormalization of the composite transformations sa(x) and sc(x)
one also introduces the external elds j(x) and h(x) which couple to them [13]. the
brs invariant classical 4-dimensional action is

scl = sym + sgf + sext,

(2)

where sy m has been given in eq. (1) and

sgf = z d4x s[c  (
sext = z d4x (cid:16)j   sa + h  sc(cid:17)(x).

b  a)](x),


2

now, standard path integral formal manipulations lead to the slavnov-taylor identity for
the 1pi functional [a, b, c, c; j, h]. this identity reads

s()  z d4x h 

j 


a

+


h


c

+ b



ci = 0.

(3)

the slavnov-taylor identity governs the brs symmetry of the theory at the quantum
level.

since the formal feynman diagrams contributing to [a, b, c, c; j, h] present uv
divergences it is not straightforward that the renormalized, would it exist, 1pi functional
dening the quantum theory satises the slavnov-taylor identity: anomalies may occur.
we shall see in this paper that as far as our explicit computations reach no anomalies
occur in the quantum theory and that indeed a renormalized brs invariant 1pi functional
does exist. we shall be working only at the one-loop level.

first, it is not dicult to see that one-loop uv divergent 1pi green functions are
following: aa, aaa, aaaa, cc, cac, j c, j ac and hcc, with obvious notation. no-
tice that the feynman rules from eq. (2) are obtained from the feynman rules for su (n )
yang-mills theory on commutative euclidean space upon the replacement fa1a2a3 
2 sin (p2, p3), p2 and p3 being respectively the momenta carried by the lines with colour
index a2 and a3. hence, the counterpart in our u (1) theory of a feynman diagram which
is nite by power-counting in the standard su (n ) theory will also be nite. since no
action principle (see ref.
[13] and references therein) has been shown to hold yet for
eld theories over noncommutative spaces, we cannot carry out a cohomological study
of the renormalizability of the theory at hand. we shall proceed by performing explicit
computations.

3

to regularize the feynman integrals of our theory will shall use dimensional regular-
ization. the dimensionally regularized counterpart of any feynman diagram is dened
as follows: rst, 2i sin (p2, p3) is expressed as ei(p2,p3)  ei(p2,p3); second, the four-
dimensional momentum measure d4p
(2)4 is replaced with the d-dimensional measure dd p
(2)d
and any 4-dimensional algebraic expression with a d-dimensional one dened according
to the rules in ref.
[14]; third, gaussian integration over the d-dimensional loop mo-
menta is carried out, which leads to an integral over the -parameter space of schwinger
introduced by using the following equation [15]

i )m =
(p2

di m1

i

eip2
i ;

and, four, d is promoted to a complex variable and any formal tensor expression is dened
to be an algebraic expression satisfying only the algebraic rules in ref.[14]. in the theory
under study we have a new algebraic object to be dened in space of d-dimensional alge-
braic objects. this is the antisymmetric matrix  , which has rank four, i.e.  = 
and (p )2 > 0 if p 6= 0. these properties are only compatible for even-dimensional
spaces, hence, we shall dene the d-dimensional algebraic object  as being intrin-
sically 4-dimensional and having the aforementioned properties:

 g = 0,  = ,  p p > 0 if p 6= 0,

p  g p .

the symbols g,g denote respectively the 4-dimensional and (d  4)-dimensional
metrics as dened in ref. [14]. with these denitions it is not dicult to show that at the
one-loop level, and provided we keep away from exceptional external momenta, the uv
divergences occur as simple poles at d = 4 whose residue is a sum of monomials, each
monomial being the product of a polynomial on the external momenta (with no hatted
metric g) and a complex exponential whose argument is as linear combination of terms of
the type  p
j (pi and pj denote external momenta). indeed, every time a exponential
carrying a loop momenta occurs in the integrand, it turns out that its dimensionally
regularized counterpart is nite at d = 4. hence, if brs invariance is not broken it would
be likely that one-loop renormalization can be achieved by multiplicative renormalization
of the parameters of the theory.

where d = 42. notice that the momentum structure of the previous contributions is the
same as corresponding term in the brs action in eq. (2), upon formal generalization of this
action to the d-dimensional space of dimensional regularization. so, one would expect
that these 1pi contributions can be subtracted by ms multiplicative renormalization of the
elds and parameters in the brs invariant action. and, indeed, this is so, if we perform
the following innite renormalizations

g0 = 2 zg g, 0 = z , a0  = za a, b0 = zb b,
and c0 = zc c,
j0  = zj j, h0 = zh h, c0 = zc c

notice that there is no renormalization of the matrix  . that these zs render uv nite
the 1pi functions whose pole contribution is in eq. (4) is a consequence of brs invariance.
indeed, in view of eq. (4), it is not dicult to show that the singular contribution, (pole),
to the dimensionally regularized 1pi functional can be recast into the form

(pole) =

a

4g2 z ddx(f  f )(x) + bd x

(6)

where

x = z ddx(cid:16)a1(j  c)  a  a2h  c(cid:17)(x),

and bd is the linearized slavnov-taylor operator acting upon the space of formal algebraic
expressions constructed with d-dimensional monomials of the elds and their deriva-

the conclusion that one draws from eq. (6) is that the uv divergent contributions
displayed in eq. (4) are brs invariant. notice that (pole) is the sum of two terms: the
second is bd-exact (recall that b2
d = 0), whereas the rst, the yang-mills term, is bd-
closed. this all goes hand in hand with analysis of the uv divergent contributions in
standard su (n ) yang-mills theory. and, indeed, as in standard four-dimensional yang-
mills theory we have

zg = 1  a, za = 1 + a1, zczc = 1  a1 + a2, zczazc = 1 + a2,
zh z2

c = 1 + a2, zb = z 1

a , z = z2

a and zj = zc.

eq. (5) is thus recovered. let us remark that the values we have obtained for the zs
agree with the corresponding values of the zs of standard su (n ) yang-mills theory on
commutative ir4 upon replacing in the latter the constant c2(g) (the quadratic casimir
in the adjoint representation) with 2. actually, the uv divergent contributions in eq. (4)
agree with those in the standard su (n ) yang-mills theory, if the following substitutions
are made in the latter: fa1a2a3  2 sin (p2, p3) and c2(g)  2. recall that the structure
constants are not renormalized in standard su (n ) yang-mills theory;  , the matrix
dening the weyl-moyal product, is not renormalized either.

we shall dene the order h ms renormalized 1pi functional (1), ms

ren

as usual:

(1), ms

ren

= lim0h(1)

dreg  (pole)i,

where (1)
dreg denotes the dimensionally regularized 1pi functional at order h and (pole)
is given in eq. (4). the limit   0 is taken after performing the subtraction of the pole
and replacing every d-dimensional algebraic object with its 4-dimensional counterpart
[14]; this is why we have denoted it by lim.

since (1)

dreg is brs invariant, i.e it satises the slavnov-taylor identity at order h

bd(1)

dreg = 0,

the ms renormalized 1pi functional (1), ms

ren

is also brs invariant:

b (1), ms

ren

= 0.

the operator b is the counterpart of bd at d = 4: the linearized slavnov-taylor operator
in noncommutative ir4. we thus conclude that the slavnov-taylor identity (eq. (3)) holds
for the renormalized theory at order h. this statement is not completely rigorous since

6

there is no proof as yet that the quantum action principle [14] holds for the dimensionally
regularized amplitudes of the theory at hand. however, in our computations we have found
no hint that this principle might not be valid here.

by using standard textbook techniques, one can work out the renormalization group

equation for ms

the elds are denoted by . it should be noticed that  is a dimensionful parameter
which does not run. the one-loop beta function of the theory is easily computed to be

(g2)

hence, the theory is asymptotically free. the other renormalization group coecients read
at the one-loop level:

j = c = b =  a,

 =  2 a ,

h =  c.

we shall nish with two remarks. first, that the structure of the uv divergences,
which is not a polynomial in momentum space, is a polynomial in the elds and their
derivatives with respect to the weyl product. one wonders whether this generalizes to
higher loops upon subtraction of subdivergences and whether the theory of normal products
(on which the method of algebraic renormalization rests) remains valid upon replacing the
ordinary product with the weyl product. second, (pole) veries both the gauge-xing
equation and the ghost equation, namely:

(pole)

b

= 0,

(pole)

c

 

(pole)

j

= 0.

hence, so does the ms renormalized 1pi functional up to order h:

ms

= b  a + o(h2),

 

ms

j

= 0 + o(h2).

acknowledgments

we heartly thank t. krajewski and r. wulkenhaar for pointing out to us a missing
complex i in our eld strength and its bearing on the sign of the beta function; we corrected
thus the wrong sign ocurring in a previous computation of the beta function. we also thank
them for letting us know that they had shown renormalizability and asymptotic freedom
of the model estudied here on the noncommutative torus [16].
