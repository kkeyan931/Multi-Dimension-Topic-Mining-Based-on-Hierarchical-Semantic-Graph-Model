we argue that non-supersymmetric large n qcd compactied on t 2 exhibits prop-

erties characteristic of an sl(2, z) t-duality. the kahler structure on which this sl(2, z)
acts is given by m
n + i2a, where a is the area of the torus, m is the t hooft magnetic
ux on the torus, and 2 is the qcd string tension.

introduction

following t hoofts discovery that the large n expansion of qcd is an expansion

in the genus of feynman graphs, [1], it has been suspected that large n qcd is a string

theory in which the string coupling is given by 1

n . this correspondance is best under-
stood for pure qcd2 [2][3][4][5]. the qcd string in higher dimensions has yet to be

constructed, although much progress has been made recently based on the maldacena con-

jecture [6][7][8][9][10]. assuming the existance of a string description, large n qcd will

inherit any self-dualities of this description. in this talk we address the question of whether

the qcd string, when compactied on a two torus, has a self t-duality. such a t-duality

would be generated by

   + 1

(1.1)

for  = b + i2a, where a is the area of the torus, b is a two form modulus, and 2 is

the string tension. for simplicity we consider only square tori. we shall argue that the

two form modulus is m

n where m is the t hooft magnetic ux [11] through the torus. this
quantity has the desired properties of periodicity, and continuity in the large n limit. we

suspect that pure qcd is not exactly self t-dual, although another theory in the same

universality class may be self dual.

in two dimensions the partition function of qcd2

is invariant under t-duality after a simple modication [12][13]. in the case of qcd4 on
t 2 r2, there are qualitative properties consistent with self t-duality. if qcd4 on t 2 r2

is t-dual to a another theory in the same universality class, there may be computationally

useful consequences. by dualizing pure qcd4 on a very large torus, one would obtain a

qcd2-like theory with two adjoint scalars. such theories have been used as toy models

which mimic some of the dynamics of pure qcd4[14][15][16]. however these models lack

a u (1)  u (1) symmetry which could generate two extra dimensions. we shall propose a

model which does have such a symmetry in the large n limit. this model is obtained by

a dimensional reduction of qcd4 preserving the zn  zn global symmetry generated by

large gauge transformations on the torus.

2. qcd2 and t-duality

consider pure euclidean qcd2 on a two-torus. the partition function for vanishing

t hooft ux is given by [17][18]

z = xr

eg2ac2(r),

(2.1)

where c2(r) is the quadratic casimir in the representation r. when the t hooft ux m

is non-vanishing, the partition function is given by [19][13]

z = xr

eg2ac2(r) trr(dm)

dr

,

(2.2)

where dr is the dimension of the representation. trr(dm) is the trace of the element in

the center of su (n ) corresponding to the t hooft ux. for instance in a representation

for which the young tableaux has nr boxes,

dm = e2i m

n nr.

(2.3)

evaluating the free energy in the planar n   limit, as done in [3] for vanishing m,

gives

where  is a dedekind eta function, and

f = ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

with g2n = . this is not quite invariant under (1.1). however the modied free energy

f = f +

a

ln(a)

(2.6)

is modular invariant. the additional term proportional to a is a local counterterm. how-

ever it is not clear what modication of the action could account for the term ln(a).

nonetheless this term is very simple, so it seems that pure qcd2 is almost self t-dual.

3. t hooft ux and two form moduli

we have seen that under t-duality, the t hooft ux m/n behaves like a two form

modulus of a string description. there are several reasons one could have guessed this

correspondance between magnetic ux and the string theory two form. first, m/n is

periodic and continuous (for n  ). second, in qcd2 with a  0, the partition
function is an integral over the moduli space of at connections. the dimension of this

space is invariant under sl(2, z) transformations acting on the doublet (m, n) [20]. under

these transformations m/n transforms precisely like the kahler structure  of string theory,

which for vanishing area is just the two form modulus.

finally using the correspondance between d-branes and yang mills theories one can

argue that under the appropriate conditions the magnetic ux is equal to the ns-ns

two-form modulus. consider a system of parallel d-branes stretched between ns5-branes

which is described by a theory with a mass gap, such as pure su (n ) n = 1 yang-mills

[21][22]. since parallel d-branes generally give rise to a u (n ) bundle, let us construct a

u (n ) bundle in which the u (1) trace degree of freedom is frozen, so that there are no

masseless u (1) degrees of freedom. on a torus the elds are periodic up to u (n ) gauge

transformations, u1 and u2, which for a u (n ) bundle satisfy

u1u2u 

1 u 

2 = i.

(3.1)

the u s may be written as products of u (1) and su (n ) pieces, so that the above equation

becomes

eirt 2 f12 e2i m

n = i,

(3.2)

where f is the u (1) eld strength. if the u (1) degree of freedom is frozen, the locally
gauge invariant combination f  b must vanish. thus one obtains

m
n

= zt 2

b.

(3.3)

note this relation was obtained for nite n. we shall argue elsewhere [23] that a periodic

potential is generated for b when there is a mass gap. in this case one can not obtain

a continuous class of theories on non-commutative tori [24][25] by varying b. having

established (3.3), one must still show that b behaves like a two-form modulus of the

qcd-string as well as the iia string. this means that b should be the imaginary part

of the action of a qcd string wrapping the torus. this can be argued [23] by lifting the

3

brane conguration to m theory, in which case the iia string and the qcd-string are

homotopic [21].

note that if a qcd t-duality exists, it is not the same t-duality in the iia theory for

a variety of reasons. it can only exist in the n   limit, when m

n becomes a continuous
parameter. also, there is no d2-brane charge in the brane costruction of qcd, so that

after a iia t-duality the d4-brane charge vanishes. furthermore the kahler structure

of the qcd-string is dierent from that of the iia string because the string tensions are

dierent.

4. qcd4 and t-duality

the four dimensional qcd string is much less understood than the two dimensional
qcd string. however there are qualitative properties of large n qcd4 on t 2  r2 which
are consistent with self t-duality. we take the time direction to lie in r2. this theory has

a u (1)  u (1) translation symmetry on the torus. if the theory is self t-dual it must have

another u (1)  u (1) symmetry corresponding to translations on the dual torus. large

gauge transformations on the torus generate a global zn  zn symmetry, which becomes

continuous as n  . if this symmetry is a translation symmetry on a dual torus, then

eigenstates of this symmetry should have energies proportional to 1/rd, where rd is the

radius of the small dual torus. this is consistent with electric connement. the eigenstates

of zn  zn transformations carry electric ux [11], which have energy proportional to
r = 1/(2rd), where r is the radius of the original torus. (we are considering the case

with vanishing magnetic ux).

if the magnetic ux is non-vanishing, then    1

 does not invert the area of the
torus. thus it would not make sense in this case to exchange the winding number of the

qcd string, or the electric ux, with the qcd momentum. in string theory the momentum
that gets exchanged with winding number under    1
 is pi = pi  bijwj. here pi
is the velocity of the string, and wj is the winding number: x i(t, ) = pit + wi + . . ..
under    + 1, pi and wj are invariant but pi is shifted. therefore the quantity in qcd
corresponding to pi is pi  m
n ij ej, where pi is the usual momentum and ei is the electric
ux. the term m
n ijej has precisely the form of a cross product of electric and magnetic

uxes and can be thought of as the contribution of t hooft uxes to the momentum.

5. why there might not be t-duality

if this zn  zn symmetry is spontaneously broken for a suciently small torus then

qcd can not be self t-dual. shrinking one cycle of the torus while keeping the other

xed would break the zn associated with the small torus, just as in a nite temperature

deconnement transition. we do not know what happens if both cycles of the torus

are shrunk simultaneously, but we can not rule out the possibility that both zn s are

spontaneously broken. even so there may still be some theory in the qcd universality

class for which the zn  zn symmetry is never spontaneously broken. recent arguments

suggest that large n qcd4 can be described by a critical string theory in a ve dimensional
in this picture,
background, whose boundary is the qcd world volume[6][7][8][9][10].

spontaneous breaking of zn  zn would require a phase transition to a ve dimensional

target space geometry in which both cycles of the boundary torus are contractible[10].

perhaps such a transition does not exist.

6. qcd4 from two dimensions

if large n qcd on t 2  r2 were self t-dual, pure qcd on r4 would be dual to qcd
on r2 with two adjoint scalars. in fact such a model has been used to approximate the

dynamics of pure qcd in 4 dimensions [14][15][16]. the adjoint scalars in this model play

the role of transversely polarized gluons. in [16] the spectrum of this two dimensional model

was computed by discrete light cone quantization and compared to the glueball spectrum of

pure 4-d qcd computed using monte-carlo simulation. the degree of numerical accuracy

allows only crude comparison, however the spectra have some qualitatively agreement.

perhaps in the n   limit the agreement is more than just qualitative. however the

usual models with adjoint scalars are incomplete since they lack a zn  zn symmetry. a

more careful dimensional reduction would give a non-linear sigma model of the form

ssu(n) =

[h2, h3][h

3](cid:19) .

(6.1)

where rs is the radius of the cycles of the torus, and hi an element of su (n ). writing
hi = exp(irsx i) and taking rs  0 with x i xed gives the usual naive reduced action.
note that the naive reduced action requires a mass counterterm for x i. in terms of the hi
elds, such a term would look like 1
r2
of course the zn  zn symmetry might be spontaneously broken for suciently small rs,

s pi t rhi, which is prohibited by zn  zn symmetry.

5

in which case the large n limit can not generate extra dimensions. at tree level there are

at directions which connect vacua related by the zn symmetry. if these at directions

are not lifted quantum mechanically, as in a supersymmetric version of this theory, then

long range uctuations in two dimensions would prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking

at nite n . unfortunately this last statement is not always true in the large n limit.

7. conclusion

we have shown that large n qcd has properties consistent with the existence of self

t-duality when compactied on a torus. it may be that qcd is not really self t-dual, but

that some qcd-like theory is.
