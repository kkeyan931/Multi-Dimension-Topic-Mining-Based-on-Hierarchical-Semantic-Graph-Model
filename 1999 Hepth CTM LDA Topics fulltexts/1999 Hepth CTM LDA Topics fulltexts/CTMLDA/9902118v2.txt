abstract

we study brane congurations for four dimensional n =1 supersymmetric gauge theories with
quartic superpotentials which ow in the infrared to manifolds of interacting superconformal
xed points. we enumerate nite n =2 theories, from which a large class of marginal n =1
theories descend. we give the brane descriptions of these theories in type iia and type
iib string theory. the type iib descriptions are in terms of d3 branes in orientifold and
generalized conifold backgrounds. we calculate the weyl and euler anomalies in these
theories, and nd that they are equal in elliptic models and unequal in a large class of nite
n =2 and marginal n =1 non-elliptic theories.

1 introduction

finite theories in four dimensions have a rich structure, much of which has been a subject of
recent interest. finite gauge theories having vanishing  functions and anomalous dimensions
are conformal, and without divergences when a perturbative expansion is valid. such theories
contain dimensionless parameters which are independent of scale and couple to marginal
operators. finite theories often belong to a continuous manifold of scale invariant theories.
the ow along these theories is characterized by a number of marginal operators equal to the
dimension of the manifold of xed points. those marginal operators which when added to
the action of a conformal theory generate a ow along the manifold of xed points are called
exactly marginal operators [1]. certain four dimensional eld theories, although having a
manifold of conformal xed points, do not have the property that all anomalous dimensions
are zero. these theories are not nite by the denition above, but in the infrared they
contain some number of exactly marginal operators.

one way of generating theories with marginal deformations is to start with a theory with
negative  functions, and perturb it by an irrelevant operator in the ultraviolet. in some
cases, upon owing to the infrared the irrelevant deformation develops a negative anomalous
dimension in such a way that it becomes marginal.

we study n =1 supersymmetric gauge theories with quartic superpotentials and marginal
deformations in the infrared. a large class of such theories are obtained from nite n =2
theories by integrating out the adjoint chiral multiplet [1, 2]. we give brane descriptions for
these theories and identify the exactly marginal operators with motions of ns5 branes in
type iia congurations, or with ns two-form elds in the type iib picture. we enumerate
all nite n =2 theories with one and two factors of classical gauge groups, and discuss
generalizations.

in section 2 we discuss, from a eld theoretic point of view, the conditions for existence of
exactly marginal operators. in section 3 we review congurations of intersecting ns5 branes
and d4 branes in the presence of d6 branes and o6 plane backgrounds in type iia string
theory. we suggest a simple criterion which when imposed on the brane congurations, gives
eld theories with exactly marginal operators. for a certain class of brane congurations (the
elliptic models) in type iia string theory, we give a t-dual picture in type iib. we generalize
the results of [3, 4, 5] to more complicated conical singularities, and discuss orientifolds in
n =1 and n = 2 theories, generalizing the analysis in [6]. in section 4 we list all conformal
n = 2 theories with one or two classical gauge groups and give the corresponding brane
descriptions. in section 5 we present a more general analysis of supergravity descriptions,
and argue that a large class of non-elliptic models which have a type iia description can

not satisfy the supergravity condition relating the euler and weyl anomalies of theories with
supergravity descriptions [7], while all elliptic models considered are shown to satisfy that
relation.

2 n = 1 theories with q4 type superpotentials

following the discussion of leigh and strassler [1] we argue that four-dimensional n =2
supersymmetric theories with vanishing one loop  function have associated with them n =
1 supersymmetric theories which have a manifold of xed points. these n =1 theories
are obtained from the n =2 nite theories by integrating out the adjoint chiral multiplet,
giving rise to a quartic superpotential in the low energy theory. the theory with quartic
superpotential has a line of xed points: in the space of coupling parameters of the theory,
there is a line along which the theory is conformally invariant. at each xed point, the
lagrangian of the theory can be deformed in such a way that the theory remains conformally
invariant. the operator which can be added to the lagrangian to deform the theory in this
way is said to be an exactly marginal operator.

the exact nsvz g function [8] for the gauge coupling in a supersymmetric gauge theory
with chiral superelds i in representations ri with dynkin indices t (ri) and anomalous
dimensions i (the normalization for the anomolous dimensions here is a factor of two larger
than in some other references), and adjoint dynkin index g, is proportional to

g  3g  xi

t (ri)[1  i].

(1)

the couplings in the superpotential, which are schematically of the form w = h12    k
are renormalized according to a similar equation for their h functions given by

h  xi

(di +

1
2

i)  3,

(2)

where di is the canonical dimension of the eld i. the theory is at a xed point when
all of the  functions in the theory vanish. the anomalous dimensions are functions of the
couplings, so each equation g = 0 or h = 0 provides one relation between the couplings.
generically there will be isolated solutions to these equations, or none at all, but if the
equations for the  functions in terms of the i are linearly dependent then there may be a
manifold of xed points of codimension equal to the rank of the set of linearly independent
 functions. in that case there are marginal operators along the manifold of xed points

2

which deform the infrared theory from one xed point to another.

for n = 2 theories with massless hypermultiplets qi in representations ri of the gauge
group, vanishing of the one loop g function is sucient for the theory to be exactly nite.
for any value of the gauge coupling g, the theory is conformally invariant and so has a line
of xed points generated by the tr(f 2) operator. the anomalous dimensions of all the elds
vanish along this line and the theory is nite.

we can now give mass to the adjoint chiral multiplet. with n = 1 chiral multiplets

qi, qi and adjoint chiral multiplet , the superpotential is of the form w = hpi tr qi qi +

mtr 2, where the trace is over the gauge indices, and h is proportional to the gauge coupling
g. integrating out the adjoint gives

w = 

h2
4m

(xi

tr qi qi)2.

(3)

depending on the structure of the adjoint  it may be necessary to add lagrange multipliers
to impose constraints on , e.g. tracelessness. in that case the exact form of w will change,
but the q4 structure will remain the same, which is the important aspect for our purposes.
the q4 coupling will ow to some value h in the far infrared that will depend on the dynam-
ical scale and adjoint mass. we can relax the condition that the contribution from each term
in the superpotential have the same coupling (assuming no avor symmetry), and consider
the possibility that a xed point with all of the couplings equal belong to a continuous family

of conformal theories with w = pi<j hij (tr qi qi)(tr qj qj ). if the parent n = 2 theory

has vanishing one loop g function, then the  functions of the corresponding n = 1 theory
are, according to (1) and (2),

g = g + xi
hi j = 1 + i + j .

t (ri)i

(4)

at a xed point, g = hi j = 0. these are n(n + 1)/2 + 1 linear equations for the n a
priori unrelated anomalous dimensions. the diagonal components i = j of (4) completely
determine the value of the n anomalous dimensions. the solutions are i =  1
2 , and the
vanishing of g then follows from the vanishing of the one loop beta function of the parent
n = 2 theory. hence, the condition that g vanish is redundant and we nd a line of xed
points.
in fact, each of the o diagonal hi j = 0 equations is linearly dependent on the
diagonal equations, so if there are n elds qi then there is a n(n  1)/2 + 1 dimensional
manifold of xed points. the xed points of the theory with superpotential (3) lie on a one

3

dimensional submanifold. there is a linear combination of the gauge coupling ww  and
the superpotential w which varies over the line of xed points and deforms the theory along
it.

the simplest example of this phenomenon is obtained from n =2 su(n) yang-mills
theory with nf hypermultiplets qi in the fundamental representation of the gauge group.
upon integrating out the adjoint, taking into account the tracelessness condition, the eective
superpotential is

this theory was studied in [1] in relation to n =1 duality.

in the following we review brane congurations involving intersecting ns5 branes and d4
branes in type iia string theory for these types of models and motivate a relation between
marginal deformations and ns5 brane motion. we enumerate theories with a small number
of gauge group factors which behave similarly to the theories discussed above and give their
corresponding brane constructions in type iia and type iib string theory. we will also see
that only a large class of these types of theories have unequal weyl and euler anomalies,
and following [7, 9] therefore do not have useful supergravity descriptions in the sense of
maldacenas conjecture [10].

3 brane congurations in type ii string theories

in this section we identify marginal operators with deformations of brane congurations or
geometry in type ii string theories. we suggest that translations of straight ns5 branes in
type iia congurations correspond in the eld theory to motion along a manifold of xed
points in the infrared. much work has been done on understanding non-perturbative eects
in eld theories from string theory. the three methods which have been employed for this
purpose rely on: (a) string theory in a non-trivial geometry; (b) the world volume theory
of branes probing a non-trivial (typically singular) geometry; and (c) the world volume
theory of branes in a brane conguration in a at background. these dierent descriptions
of the eld theories can often be related by various dualities.
in the following we review
congurations of intersecting branes in type iia string theory in at minkowski space for
the theories alluded to in the previous section, and then discuss the t-duality which maps
these congurations to d-branes probing singular geometries in type iib string theory.

type iia brane constructions and marginal deformations

congurations of intersecting d4 branes and ns5 branes in type iia string theory in at
minkowski space are well studied (for a review see [11]). in this paper, we will be using ns5,
ns5, d4 and d6 branes in the following directions:

the conguration shown in fig. 1 consists of ns5, d4 and d6 branes.

the d4 branes end on ns5 branes and are of nite extent l in the x6 direction. the
ns5 and d4 branes are at a point in x7, x8, x9.
if there are n d4 branes and nf d6
branes, the eld theory on the world volume of the d4 branes at length scales much larger
than l is a four dimensional n = 2 su(n) gauge theory with nf hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation (corresponding to the strings ending on the d6 branes and d4
branes). instead of using d6 branes, avors can be added with nf semi-innite d4 branes
oriented in the same direction as the other d4 branes. the two ways of adding avors to
the gauge theory can be related by passing the d6 branes through the ns5 branes, at which
point a d4 brane is created stretching between the d6 and the ns5 branes [12].

5

as discussed in [13], the force exerted by the d4 branes on ns5 branes causes the ns5
branes to bend in the x6 direction. the distance between the ns5 branes corresponds to
the gauge coupling: 1/g2 = l/ where  is the string coupling constant. the running
of the gauge coupling is nicely reected by the bending of the ns5 branes.
if the beta
function of the gauge theory is zero, the ns5 branes can be at xed values of x6 with no
bending asymptotically. this will be the case when nf = 2n, with n semi-innite d4
branes from the left and n from the right of each ns5 brane (if there are no d6 branes). in
the presence of d6 branes, the requirement for there to be no relative bending of the ns5
4, ri
branes asymptotically is that the linking number of each ns5 brane is identical: if li
are the number of d4 branes attached to the left and right of the ith ns5 brane and li
6, ri
6
are the number of d6 branes to the left and right of that ns5 brane, then the linking number
(li
6) must be the same for each ns5 brane. (o6 planes, if present, would
contribute to linking numbers as if they were () a pair of physical d6 branes. o4 planes
passing through an ns5 brane change sign, and contribute (2) units of d4 brane charge to
the linking number of the ns5 brane through which they pass.) if a conguration has equal
nonzero linking numbers for each ns5 brane, then sixbranes can be added past the leftmost
or rightmost ns5 brane such that all linking numbers will vanish. the additional sixbranes
do not aect the eld theory on the fourbranes since they can be moved to innity.

if one of the ns5 branes is rotated out of the (x4, x5) plane and into the (x7, x8) plane,
then the d4 branes can no longer slide along the ns5 branes and the coulomb branch of
the theory is lifted. this corresponds to giving a mass to the adjoint proportional to tan 
where  is the angle of rotation of the ns5 branes. (this dependence should only be trusted
for masses well below the string scale; otherwise the adjoint might decouple at a scale higher
than the string scale, but we are ignoring all string states.) the eld theory living on the
world-volume of the d4 branes can be obtained by integrating out the adjoint. we get a n =1
theory with a quartic superpotential. if we start from a theory which has no asymptotic
bending of the ns5 branes, i.e. nf = 2n, it is easy to see that there is an exactly marginal
operator which generates a manifold of xed points (as discussed in detail in the previous
section).

an obvious extension of the brane conguration discussed above is shown in fig. 2.

rotating an ns5 brane into the (x7, x8) plane gives a mass to the adjoint chiral multiplets
of the gauge groups to the left and right of that ns5 brane. the contribution to the masses
of the adjoints is of opposite sign to the left and right of the rotated ns5 brane. this breaks
n =2 to n =1 and gives rise to a quartic superpotential for those elds which transform
under the gauge groups to the left and right of the ns5 brane as discussed in section 2.

the existence of a marginal deformation in the infrared is motivated by the absence of
logarithmic bending of the ns5 branes in congurations with vanishing linking numbers, and
hence the absence of a scale in those theories. the independent translations of the ns5 branes
are intuitively expected to correspond to marginal deformations in the infrared precisely
because they are deformations not associated with a dimensionful parameter. rotations of
ns5 branes induce masses for the adjoint elds, and are thus relevant deformations in the
ultraviolet. these relevant deformations also induce a ow along the manifold of xed points
in the infrared theory, but do not correspond to exactly marginal operators. more precisely,
there is a linear combination of the gauge coupling, w w, and the couplings in the infrared
superpotential, w , which when added to the action of the infrared theory deforms the theory
along the line of xed points. at each xed point there are independent marginal operators
corresponding to the gauge coupling and the terms in the superpotential (corresponding to
motions of the ns5 branes), but by adding only one combination of marginal operators to
the action does the theory remain conformally invariant.

7

the proposed intuition relating deformations of brane congurations with straight branes
and exactly marginal operators is generally absent in a curved spacetime background because
of the scale induced by the curvature. for example, in the presence of d6 branes and
orientifolds, the intuition relating ns5 brane motion to marginal operators is more tenuous,
and we identify marginal deformations only if the linking numbers of all ns5 branes, including
the contributions due to the orientifold charges, vanish. in the n =2 case, translations of ns5
branes correspond to variation of the gauge coupling, which is indeed an exactly marginal
deformation for the nite theories. in the n =1 case, with rotated ns5 branes, the relation
between translations of ns5 branes and exactly marginal operators is not as immediately
evident, but we will see that theories with straight rotated branes generally have marginal
deformations as well. the identication of the exactly marginal operator corresponding to
the ns5 brane motion can be made at weak coupling (where it corresponds to changing the
gauge couplingthe exactly marginal operator is trf 2). at strong coupling, the operator
corresponding to the ns5 brane motion cannot be identied easily. however, the existence
of such an operator can be seen from the brane picture.

elliptic models

and the gauge group is qm

an interesting set of models is obtained if the x6 direction is compactied on a circle of
length l, with d6 branes between any pair of ns5 branes. then k0 = km +1 by denition,
=0 su(k)  u(1). the extra u(1) is from uniform translation
of the fourbranes along the (x4, x5) directions. the hypermultiplet spectrum is as before
except that the k0 and km +1 fundamental hypermultiplets before compactication combine
to give a bifundamental transforming under su(km ) and su(k0) and another bifundamen-
tal hypermultiplet transforming under su(k0) and su(k1). none of the hypermultiplets is
charged under the extra u(1), so the u(1) factor decouples from the theory and we will not
be interested in it. the beta function for each group is still given by (6). it is easy to see
that the only way to get zero or negative beta functions for all groups is to set d = 0 and
k = n for all . this implies that all b0, = 0, and there is no relative bending of the ns5
branes.

it is worthwhile to note that the relation between bending of ns5 branes and the beta
function must be reconsidered in elliptic models. the linking numbers are not well dened a
priori because the notion of left and right is imprecise on the circle. however, the relation can
be made more precise by introducing a fundamental domain on the circle. if the circle is cut
at any point and treated as a theory on a non-compact background, then the linking numbers
on any ns5 brane must be equal for the theory to be nite. choosing a dierent fundamental
domain, i.e. cutting the circle at a dierent location, will lead to dierent linking numbers

8

in general, but the equality of linking numbers is unaected by this choice. furthermore, the
beta functions are related to relative dierences between linking numbers of neighboring ns5
branes just as in the non-compact case. on the circle, marginal deformations are related to
both translations of ns5 branes along the circle and variations of the radius of the compact
direction.

type iib descriptions

for the elliptic models we can perform a t-duality along the compact x6 direction. a
conguration with a set of n5 parallel ns5 branes in type iia string theory is mapped to
type iib on an51r6, where an51 is a c2/zzn5 orbifold type ale space. the n d4 branes
which wrap the compact direction are mapped to d3 branes. so the conguration discussed
above with a compact x6 direction is t-dual to n d3 branes at an an51 singularity. the
d3 branes occupy the (x0, x1, x2, x3) directions and the ale space is in the (x6, x7, x8, x9)
directions.

turning on two-form b-elds which have non-vanishing ux over the vanishing two-cycles
at the singularity corresponds to moving the ns5 branes in the x6 direction. in the eld
theory this corresponds to variations in the gauge couplings [14]. there is a question of the
ordering of the ns5 branes which we will not discuss here. the formalism for studying d
branes at orbifold singularities was developed in [14]. the world volume theory on the d3
branes is determined by the orbifold action on spacetime and chan-paton factors (and can
be encoded in quiver diagrams or generalizations such as in [14, 15, 16, 17]), and is the same
as the theory that we started with in the type iia picture before performing the t-duality.
the n =1 theories correspond to brane congurations with rotated ns5 branes. on the
type iib side, the resolved singular space varies over the (x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9) directions, and
can be described by a type of blowup of the orbifold singularity, as discussed in [3, 4, 5, 18]
for the case of the a1 type singularity. alternatively, as described in [19], the space can be
thought of as a complex deformation of the orbifold singularity, re-embedded in a weighted
projective space. in the complex deformation approach, the algebraic form of the orbifold
singularity is changed so as to smooth out the singularity. the orbifold singularity is invariant
under a c action which is absent in the deformed curve. by re-embedding the deformed
curve in a weighted projective space we restore the c action, and the resulting curve is the
generalized conifold. more explicitly, the ak orbifold singularity is given by a curve of the
form

xk+1 + y2 + z2 = 0.

(7)

it is invariant under a c action with weights (1, k+1

2 , k+1

2 ) for (x, y, z).

9

the multiplicity of the singularity is k, equal to the rank of the corresponding ak gauge
group, and the singularity can be thought of as a bouquet of k spheres shrinking to zero
size. a general deformation of the curve must have at least k parameters specifying the
deformation. a deformation is called miniversal if it is specied by a number of parameters
equal to the multiplicity k of the singularity, and if any deformation is equivalent to that
deformation. one can generate a miniversal deformation of a singular curve by adding all
polynomials to the function specifying the curve, modulo polynomials times the rst partial
derivatives of the non-deformed curve [20]. for example, the complex deformation of the
curve (7) is of the form [19, 21]

xk+1 +

k

xm=1

tm xkm + y2 + z2 = 0.

(8)

this deformed curve is then projectivized by introducing a new variable s with projective
weight 1, giving the ak generalized conifold,

we can replace the deformation parameters ti by angles i, and rewrite (9),

(10)

in this form, we identify the angles i with the rotation angles of the ns5 branes in the type
iia picture. the masses of the adjoints are given by the relative angles, mi  tan(i+1  i),
at least for small relative angles i+1  i, and satisfy the periodicity condition pi mi = 0.

for example, the a1 curve, corresponding to a pair of ns5 branes on a circle, interpolates
between the n =2 orbifold (1 = 0, 2 = 0) and the n =1 conifold (1 = 0, 2 = /2). the
generalized conifold (9) was also shown in [19] to correspond to the moduli space of the
higgs branch of the corresponding n =1 gauge theory by studying solutions to the d- and
f -atness equations.

adding orientifolds

we can obtain a rich class of theories by adding orientifolds to the type iia brane congu-
rations described above. in fact, as we will see in the next section, the nite n = 2 theories
with simple classical groups and products of two factors, and with at most two-index matter,

10

can be obtained in the type iia brane picture if we use orientifold planes. we will mostly
be interested in o6 planes occupying the (x0, x1, x2, x3, x7, x8, x9) directions (parallel to d6
branes introduced earlier) and o4 planes parallel to the d4 branes.

consider a collection of ns5 branes (and their images under orientifold reection) at some
distance from an o6 plane. d4 branes can stretch between pairs of ns5 branes, but only
in congurations symmetric under the orientifold reection. for example, the conguration
with 2n d4 branes (n physical d4 branes and their images) stretched between a ns5 brane
and its orientifold image, as discussed in [22], corresponds to an n = 2 so(2n) or usp(2n)
theory, depending on the sign of the orientifold charge. we can add nf d6 branes and
their images to the above setup. then we get 2nf fundamental chiral multiplets under the
gauge group, or nf hypermultiplets. if the sixbrane rr charge of the o6 plane is +4(-
4) (physical charge +2,(-2)), we get an so(2n) (usp(2n)) gauge theory with usp(2nf )
(so(2nf )) avor symmetry. as before, this way of adding avors is equivalent to adding
semi-innite d4 branes. the absence of bending of the ns5 branes requires vanishing beta
function in the gauge theory. hence we need nf = 2n 2 for the case of o6+ and nf = 2n +2
for the case of o6. this can be understood on the basis of the fourbrane charge induced
on the ns5 branes by the presence of the o6 plane. since the orientifold carries sixbrane
charge, it interacts with the ns5 brane as though there were sixbranes or anti-sixbranes
present. that a fourbrane charge is induced is evident by conservation of rr charge and the
fact that pulling a sixbrane through a ns5 brane produces a fourbrane connecting them [12].
then in order to balance the force of the fourbrane charges on the ns5 brane, the number
of d4 branes attached to the left and right sides of each ns5 must dier. in other words,
the linking number of each ns5 brane should be the same.

in the presence of an o6 plane as above, ns5 branes not stuck to the o6 plane can
be rotated out of the (x4, x5) plane into the (x7, x8) plane. each ns5 brane and its image
are rotated in opposite directions because the conguration has to remain symmetric under
reection about the orientifold plane, (x4, x5, x6)  (x4, x5, x6). as a result of this
rotation, the d4 branes are xed at the origin and cannot slide between the ns5 branes
anymore. as usual, this corresponds in the eld theory to giving a mass to the adjoint chiral
multiplet, breaking n =2 to n = 1 and lifting the coulomb branch of the theory. the
eld theory analysis shows that by integrating out the adjoint, at low energies, we will see a
marginal quartic superpotential in the avor superelds.

an interesting n = 1 conguration is obtained when the angle of rotation of each ns5
brane is /2. in that case, the two ns5 branes become parallel to each other and to the o6
plane and the d4 branes can slide o between the two ns5 branes. this shows that there
must be a eld in the eld theory which is becoming massless at this point. the additional

11

eld was shown in [23, 24] to tranform as a symmetric tensor under the so(2n) gauge group
or antisymmetric tensor under the usp(2n) gauge group; hence, at this point the adjoint
chiral multiplet is substituted by the opposite type of two index tensor. the conjecture that
ns5 brane motion corresponds to exactly marginal deformations leads to a prediction that
the theory on the d4 branes of this brane conguration has a manifold of xed points, but
only for the usp case. the so theory comes from an o6+ plane, whose sixbrane charge
parallel to the ns5 branes cannot be canceled. this theory will be discussed further in
section 4. even though we expect there to be marginal deformations of the usp theory, we
cannot conclude that the manifold of xed points of this theory is related to the manifold
of xed points of the theory without the symmetric tensor. the interchange of the adjoint
and tensor elds involves passing through mass scales for these elds larger than the string
scale. in order to trace what happens to these theories we would have to include the eects
of string states which we have been ignoring. furthermore, since rotations of ns5 branes
correspond to relevant deformations, we should not expect in general to remain on the same
manifold of xed points after such perturbations of the theory. translations of ns5 branes
are expected to yield exactly marginal deformations of the theory. it is sometimes the case
that relevant deformations, such as those induced by rotations of the ns5 branes, lead to a
ow along the manifold of xed points in the infrared, but this is not generically the case.

next we will consider the elliptic models with o6 planes. the x6 direction is compact:
x6  x6 + 2l. in that case, there are two orientifold xed planes located at the two xed
points of the action x6  x6 (x6 = 0, l). the o6 planes carry 4 units of sixbrane charge
(2 physical units). as was observed in [6], vanishing total ramond-ramond sixbrane charge
in type iia n =2 brane congurations is necessary for niteness of the resulting gauge
theories. this is clear given the relation between ns5 brane bending and the  function,
and is equivalent to the condition for tadpole cancelation in the type iib picture of the
same theories obtained after performing a t-duality in the x6 direction.

for example, consider a n = 2 theory with two ns5 branes away from the orientifolds.
if the two o6 planes have opposite charges, as in fig. 26, then no d6 branes are required to
cancel the sixbrane charge, and the nite theory on the d4 branes is a so(2n) usp(2n 2)
gauge theory with two bifundamental half hypermultiplets.

we can now perform a t-duality along the x6 direction, as in [6]. the d4 branes map to
d3 branes. the two ns5 branes give a a1 ale space in the (x6, x7, x8, x9) directions which
corresponds to a zz2 singularity at x6 = x7 = x8 = x9 = 0. the orbifold group is {1, r6789}
where r6789 is the reection

r6789 : (x6, x7, x8, x9)  (x6, x7, x8, x9).

12

the t-dual of the pair of o6 planes is an o7 plane. the orientifold group is {1, r45}, where
 is a world-sheet parity reversal, and the action on the chan-paton factors is such as to
produce the correct gauge group. however, for this to be consistent with the orbifold action,
the correct orientifold projection should be {1, r6789, r45, r456789}. roughly speaking,
this corresponds to an o7 plane in the (x0, x1, x2, x3, x6, x7, x8, x9) directions and an o3
plane in the (x0, x1, x2, x3) directions, but these orientifolds do not carry ramond-ramond
charge. the action of the orientifold/orbifold system on the chan-paton factors can be
determined by tadpole cancelation [6], which leads to the so(2n)  usp(2n  2) gauge
theory as before the t-duality.

1tr2

we can now rotate the two ns5 branes in opposite directions. this corresponds to adding
a mass term of the form m(tr2
2). integrating out the adjoint gives a marginal quartic
superpotential for the rest of the matter. the type iib congurations corresponding to
type iia congurations with rotated ns5 branes are obtained by a deformation of the n =2
conguration of the type described above and in [19], with the additional complication that
orientifolds are present in these theories. we do not give more explicit constructions for
this case here. supergravity descriptions for d-branes at combined orbifold and orientifold
singularities were studied in [25].

it is interesting now to consider the conguration with d4 branes parallel to o4 planes
(fig. 3). it is well known that the rr charge of an o4 plane changes sign as it passes through
an ns5 brane [26, 27]. the theory on the world-volume of the d4 brane is an n = 2 so(2n)
 usp(2n-2) gauge theory, which is the same theory we obtained above with o6 planes. by
a t-duality, we apparently get d3 branes with an orientifold/orbifold projection which is the
same as the one obtained for the previous case. this is an interesting example of dierent
type iia brane congurations which describe the same theory on the world volume of the
d4 branes, and have the same t-dual in the compact direction. a puzzle arises when we
consider t-dualizing the type iib theory along the compact direction. it is unclear which
of the type iia congurations it should t-dualize to. these types of orientifolds are not yet
understood well enough to resolve this issue, and merit further study.

there is another conguration of two ns5 branes and o6 planes on a circle, in which the
ns5 branes are stuck in position to the o6 planes, giving rise to an n =2 su(2n) theory
with symmetric and antisymmetric tensor hypermultiplets. the t-dual of this conguration
is again given by an o7 plane with spacetime action as above, but with a dierent choice of
chan-paton matrices, as described in [6, 27, 28, 29]. note that the conguration with the
o4 plane wrapping the x6 direction cannot give rise to this theory by changing the positions
of the ns5 branes. this theory has q4 type marginal operators as discussed earlier, but the
ns5 branes in the corresponding brane conguration (fig. 11) are not free to rotate. in this

case the only marginal deformation is from changing the circle radius.

4 brane congurations for theories with exactly marginal

operators

as discussed in section 3, construction of brane congurations of intersecting ns5 branes
and d4 branes with all the ns5 branes having the same linking number is a convenient way
to generate theories with exactly marginal operators. in this section, we study a number of
such congurations. for the congurations preserving 8 supercharges, which correspond to
four dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric low energy theory on the world-volume of the d4
branes, equal linking numbers of the ns5 branes and the existence of an exactly marginal
operator in the eld theory is implied by vanishing one-loop  function for the eld theory
(which, in this case, implies that the theory is nite). the linking number criterion for brane
congurations generates almost all n = 2 nite congurations with factors of classical gauge
groups. integrating out the adjoint chiral eld from the n = 2 nite theory, we nd an n = 1
theory with a quartic superpotential which was shown to have an exactly marginal operator
in section 2. as we will see, some of the n = 1 eld theories with quartic superpotentials
that we obtain by studying brane congurations are not related to n = 2 theories by
integrating out an adjoint.

14

4.1 n = 2 nite theories with classical gauge groups

su(n) with 2n hypermultiplets

the brane conguration is shown in fig. 1. the linking number of each ns5 brane is zero, so
the ns5 branes are asymptotically straight. as discussed in the previous section, there are
two equivalent ways of getting the same eld theory on the world volume of the d4 branes 
with or without d6 branes. by rotating one of the ns5 branes in the conguration with no
d6 branes, we get an n = 1 conguration in which the ns5 branes still do not bend so we
expect an exactly marginal operator in the n = 1 eld theory on the d4 branes (which is
su(n) gauge theory with 2n avors). rotating the ns5 branes corresponds to integrating
out the adjoint, which results in a quartic superpotential for the eld theory. the analysis
in section 2 shows that there is indeed an exactly marginal operator in the eld theory.

the sixbrane rr charge of the o6 plane can be locally canceled by putting 4 d6 branes
on top of it. the rest of the d6 branes can be moved in pairs, past the ns5 branes and
to innity to get a conguration with 2n semi-innite d4 branes on each side (fig.4). the
two ns5 branes can then be rotated by an angle  out of the (x4, x5) plane into the (x8, x9)
plane. this just corresponds to integrating out the adjoint and gives a theory with an exactly
marginal operator. when  = /2, an antisymmetric tensor chiral eld, a, becomes massless
and parameterizes the motion of the d4 branes along the ns5 branes (fig.4). this theory

the superpotential is

the conditions for vanishing  functions are:

0 = a + 2q

0 = 1 + 2q

0 = 1 + q + f

0 = 1 + 2f .

only three of these equations are linearly independent implying the possibility that the
theory has a two dimensional manifold of xed points and hence has two exactly marginal
operators. as before, we can identify the translations in the x6 directions of the ns5 branes
with an exactly marginal operator. however, this accounts for only one such operator. it is
not easy to check if all the quartic terms in the superpotential are actually present. these
terms arise from integrating out the the adjoint in the n = 2 theory. if we assume that one
of these terms is zero, we will get only one exactly marginal operator from the eld theory
analysis which agrees with the counting from the brane picture. however, if all the quartic
superpotential terms are non-zero and the eld theory has two exactly marginal operators,
we might be able to see the second exactly marginal operator by the motion of the 4 d6
branes in the x6 direction. this motion is parameterized by one variable if we require that
two physical d6 branes remain on top of each other when they move; from the eld theory
point of view, this means that the operator preserves an so(4) avor symmetry acting on
the f s, which is implied by the superpotential above. although motion of the d6 branes
is irrelevant for the ir dynamics in the n = 2 case, here, we expect it to be important:
for example, when we move the d6 branes past the ns5 branes, the theory loses a avor.
so motion of the d6 brane past the ns5 branes corresponds to a relevant operator for the

16

eld theory. we propose that the motion of the d6 branes might correspond to an exactly
marginal operator when the d6 branes are between the ns5 branes.

if n is odd, there is a d4 brane which cannot move from the o6 plane. for the n = 2
conguration (fig.5), the linking numbers of each ns5 brane is zero. we can rotate the
ns5 branes from the (x4, x5) plane into the (x8, x9) plane by an angle . the presence
of the orientifold plane causes the image of the ns5 brane to move with an angle .
this corresponds to integrating out the adjoint giving rise to a quartic superpotential. as
discussed in section 3, an interesting n = 1 conguration arises when  = /2. however, for
the purpose of generating a eld theory with an exactly marginal operator, this conguration
is not very useful since the charge of the o6+ plane cannot be canceled.

su(n) with

+ (n  2)

hypermultiplets

the linking number of each ns5 brane is zero which implies that the ns5 branes do not
bend and the  function of the eld theory on the d4 branes world volume is zero (fig.6).
an interesting chiral n = 1 conguration is obtained in which the ns5 brane on top of an
o6 plane is replaced by an ns5 brane in directions (x0, x1, x2, x3, x8, x9) [30, 31]. the ns5
brane, located at x7 = 0 divides the o6 plane into two regions  x7 > 0 and x7 < 0. in such
a conguration, the orientifold charge jumps from 4 to +4 as we cross the ns5 brane [26].
the part of the orientifold with negative charge has 8 semi-innite d6 branes embedded in it
which are required by charge conservation [30]. now n d4 branes are stretched between an
ns5 brane and its image under such an orientifold (with the ns5 brane and 8 semi-innite

should act exactly like an o6+ plane. so we need 2(n  2) d6 branes (n  2 physical d6
branes and their images) for the linking numbers of each ns5 branes to be zero. as discussed
in [30], the theory on the world-volume of the d4 branes is a chiral n = 1 su(n) gauge
theory with chiral elds:

it is easy to check that this theory is anomaly free  the total anomaly (2n + 4)  (2n 
4) + (n  4)  (n + 4) is zero. the theory has a superpotential

w = q sq + qx q

if we rotate the ns5 branes out of the v = x4 + ix5 plane and into the w = x8 + ix9 plane by
an angle  and its image by , the theory will have an adjoint  which will in general be
massive except when  = /2 when the adjoint becomes massless. the superpotential for

18

the conguration with a generic value of  is

w = q sq + qx q + x s + ()2.

for nonzero values of (), we can integrate  out and obtain the superpotential

the equations for vanishing  functions for the couplings of this theory are:

0 = 3(2n)  (n  2)(1  x)  (n + 2)(1   s)  (2n + 4)(1  q)  (2n  4)(1   q)
0 = 2q +  s
0 = 2 q + x
0 = 1 + x +  s.

these equations are linearly dependent any three imply the fourth. so we expect an exactly
marginal operator in the eld theory which is what we see from the brane picture.

multiplet corresponding to the motion of the d4 branes along the ns5 brane. so the matter
content is indeed that on an n = 4 theory. the superpotential couplings are also exactly
that of the n = 4 theory. upon t-duality, we get n d3 branes.

expect to get an n = 1 theory on the d4 branes which has an exactly marginal operator.
the ns5 brane splits the o6 plane into two parts and the orientifold charge jumps from 4

the x6 direction is compactied on a circle. it is more tricky to dene linking number
on a circle. finiteness implies that the linking numbers of each ns5 branes should be the
same for a fundamental domain of the circle. we cannot rotate the ns5 branes continuously
because of the orientifold symmetry (fig.11). however, there are two n = 1 congurations
we can get from this theory (shown in fig.12). in fig.12a, the two ns5 branes are orthogonal
to each other such that the ns5 brane (on top of the o6) is parallel to the o6 planes.
in fact, the ns5 brane splits the orientifold into two parts (corresponding to x7 > 0 and
x7 < 0) and the orientifold charge jumps from 4 to +4 at x7 = 0. for charge conservation
and vanishing of the six dimensional anomaly, the part of the orientifold with negative charge
has eight semi-innite d6 branes embedded in it. the theory on the d4 branes is an n = 1

it is easy to see that these equations are linearly dependent. there should be one exactly

su(n) with 2

hypermultiplets

the orientifolds are o6 planes which have 4 units of sixbrane rr charge. finiteness of
the eld theory implies that the rr charge in the x6 direction vanishes and that is achieved
by the addition of 8 d6 branes (4 physical branes and 4 images). these d6 branes give 4
hypermultiplets. the ns5 branes on each o6 planes gives rise to 2
hypermultiplets.
the n = 1 congurations which correspond to ns5 branes being replaced by ns5 are
not interesting for our purposes because they will necessarily have non-vanishing sixbrane
rr charge. the orientifold charge jumps from 4 to +4 where it intersects the ns5 brane.
as explained above, we need 8 semi-innite d6 branes embedded in the side of the orientifold

description for those theories. this is complicated in practice because of the orbifold,conifold
and orientifold geometries, but the near horizon geometry of the d3 branes in these back-
grounds is expected to be related to the corresponding gauge theories via the ads/cft

correspondence [10, 34, 35]. it has been argued [7, 9] that the dierence between the weyl
and euler anomalies must vanish to leading order in n in gauge theories which have useful
supergravity descriptions.
in this section we argue that the elliptic models admit useful
supergravity descriptions, while non-elliptic n =2 nite and their descendent n =1 marginal
theories do not. consider the n =2 nite elliptic model given by the brane construction in
fig. 27. the gauge theory on the four-branes has gauge group su(n)m with bifundamental
hypermultiplets as below:

since the fermion in the adjoint chiral multiplets should transform with the same r-charge
as the gauginos (by n =2 supersymmetry), the adjoint chiral multiplets have r-charge 2.

at a conformal xed point, the dierence between the weyl and euler anomalies, c  a,

is proportional to the u(1)r anomaly [36, 37]. the u(1)r anomaly is easily computed:

 hjrt t i  xi

dim ri(ri  1),

(11)

where dim ri is the dimension of the representation of the chiral multiplet with r-charge ri,
and t is shorthand for the stress tensor. since the adjoint fermions in the n =2 su(n)m
elliptic model have charge +1 and the matter fermions have charge 1, it is easy to see that
the condition c  a = 0 is satised. one way to see this is that the number of adjoint fermion
degrees of freedom is 2mn 2, which is the same as the number of matter fermion degrees of
freedom.

now consider rotating one of the ns5 branes. this breaks n =2 to n =1 with the result
of assigning r-charge zero to the adjoint fermions (except the gauginos, which have charge
1 by convention) and r-charge 1/2 to the matter multiplet fermions. the anomaly c  a is
proportional in this case to the number of gauginos minus half the number of matter fermion
degrees of freedom. since now the adjoint chiral fermions (half of the n =2 vector multiplet)
do not contribute, the anomaly is proportional to the n =2 result, so c  a = 0 in this case as
well. this way of thinking about the quantity c  a, as counting fermion degrees of freedom,
is useful because it can be easily generalized to the more complicated cases with orientifold
planes.

if we add a pair of o6 planes in the n =2 elliptic model with appropriate symmetry to
accommodate the o6 reections as described in the previous sections, the eect is as follows:
a) if the number of ns5 branes (including the images under the o6 reection) is even,
n5 = 2m, and the o6 planes do not intersect any of the ns5 branes (fig. 28a), then the
gauge theory has m + 1 factors. two of the factors are so or usp, while the rest are su.
to order n 2 the adjoint of so(n) or usp(n) has n 2/2 degrees of freedom. summing the
contribution from the two so or usp factors gives n 2, the same as the contribution from
adjoints of the su(n)m elliptic model. including the m bifundamentals, the u(1)r anomaly
again vanishes.

b) if the number of ns5 branes is even, n5 = 2m, and the o6 planes intersect two of
the ns5 branes (fig. 28b), then the gauge theory has m su factors, m  1 bifundamentals
and two symmetric or antisymmetric tensors. the symmetric and antisymmetric tensors
make up the dierence in degrees of freedom corresponding to the extra bifundamental in
the elliptic su(n)m theory.

figure 28: elliptic models with o6 planes. d6 branes and the signs of the rr charge carried
by the o6 planes is not given in the gures. the net d6 brane charge always cancels in these
theories. furthermore, the ns5 branes that are not stuck to the o6 planes can be rotated
symmetrically.

c) if the number of ns5 branes is odd, n5 = 2m + 1, then one o6 plane intersects an
ns5 brane and the other does not (fig. 28c). the gauge theory has m + 1 factors, one
of which is so or usp. there are m bifundamentals and one symmetric or antisymmetric
tensor. since the gauginos of so contribute half as many degrees of freedom as those of
su, and similarly for the symmetric or antisymmetric tensor, the contribution of the so or
usp gauginos to c  a cancels with the tensor, and the counting of the remaining degrees of
freedom is again like the su(n)m theory.

depending on the sign of the rr charges of the orientifolds, in some theories extra d6
branes will be required to cancel the ux of sixbrane charge in the x6 direction, or equivalently
for niteness of the n =2 theory. the d6 branes give rise to additional avors, which are
also required in those cases for conformality. the additional avors do not contribute to
c  a to leading order in n, so they were ignored in the counting above.

alternatively, an o4 plane can wrap the x6 direction, parallel to the d4 branes, in which
case the theory is an alternating sousp    theory with bifundamental half hypermulti-
plets. it is easy to see that c  a = 0 in this case, as well.

as discussed earlier, ns5 branes can be rotated in the orientifold theories in such a way
as to preserve the orientifold symmetry, breaking n =2 to n =1. the argument regarding
rotating branes in the su(n)m elliptic models is valid in these cases as well, and we nd
c  a = 0 for the n =1 elliptic orientifold models.

for certain specic orientations of the ns5 branes with respect to the o6 planes, addi-
tional massless degrees of freedom appear. for example, as described in the last section, if

35

an ns5 brane and its image are parallel to the o6 plane, and there are no other ns5 branes
between them, then an additional antisymmetric (symmetric) tensor appears for the corre-
sponding usp (so) gauge group, associated with movement of the d4 branes in the x7, x8
direction [23]. the additional tensor does not contribute to the u(1)r anomaly because by
gauge anomaly freedom the fermion in the tensor chiral multiplet has vanishing r-charge.

the equivalence of the weyl and euler anomalies in the elliptic theories is not surprising,
since type iib congurations have been constructed which describe them, from which one
can determine their supergravity description. however, this result can be used to prove that
non-elliptic conformal or marginal theories which have a type iia brane description with
vanishing net sixbrane charge and linking numbers do not satisfy the condition ca = 0. the
argument is as follows: two copies of the type iia brane conguration for the non-elliptic
theory can be connected to form an elliptic model considered above if the net sixbrane charge
and ns5 linking numbers vanish for each copy separately (fig. 29). the resulting elliptic
model satises the condition c  a = 0 as discussed above. the dierence in the counting of

figure 29: glueing together copies of non-elliptic theories with vanishing net sixbrane charge
on a circle.

degrees of freedom in this case versus the case of the two separate copies is from additional
gauginos for each of the two new fourbrane links. since the degrees of freedom of the
new gauginos do not cancel the four additional bifundamentals, the non-elliptic theory from
which we started could not have satised c  a = 0. theories which are not included in this
argument include those with non-vanishing linking numbers, i.e. bending branes, theories

36

with non-vanishing net sixbrane charge, and theories without semi-innite d4 branes at both
the left and right side of the conguration (fig. 30).

6 a comment on brane boxes

a similar analysis to that of the last section can be done for brane box models. a large
class of brane box models describes nite n =4,2,1 theories [38]. in these theories there are
bifundamentals and/or adjoints with cubic superpotentials. the n =2 theories are the same
as the su(n)m theories described above, and the n =4 theory is the usual su(n) gauge
theory. the n =1 models dier from ours in both matter content and superpotential. we
briey review their construction and describe the restrictions on which of these theories may
have a supergravity description in light of the results of [7], in analogy with the discussion
in the previous section.

the basic brane box for four dimensional gauge theories is a type iib brane conguration
consisting of a two dimensional lattice of ns5 branes lled with d5 branes of nite extent in
two directions. we will consider elliptic brane box congurations, in which the conguration
is dened on a torus. there are two classes of such congurations:

a) n =1 congurations can be obtained by twisting the torus of an n =2 conguration,
as in fig. 31. there are bifundamental chiral multiplets between pairs of neighboring and
diagonally neighboring su(n) group factors labeled 1,2,. . .,m. the grid represents the ns5
branes, and there are n d5 branes in each box. the matter content can be summarized
as three sets of bifundamental chiral multiplets cyclically permuted among the su(n) fac-

tors. there is a cubic superpotential consisting of gauge invariant triple products of the
bifundamentals.

b)alternatively, generic tori of k  k boxes with k, k > 1 describe n =1 theories, as in

fig. 32.

in either case, the number of bifundamentals is 3m, where m is the number of boxes.
each bifundamental fermion has r-charge -1/3 in this case because of the cubic superpoten-
tial, so the contribution to c  a of the mn 2 gaugino degrees of freedom cancels that of the
3mn 2 matter fermions, so c  a = 0 in these elliptic brane box models. it is not surprising
that the elliptic brane box models should satisfy the supergravity condition since they have
t-dual descriptions in terms of d3 branes at orbifold singularities [38, 39, 40, 41].

if some of the boxes are made innitely large in one direction, we obtain the cylindrical
brane box models described in [38]. arguments similar to those in the previous section show
that these theories do not satisfy the c  a = 0 condition.

7 conclusions

we have studied four dimensional n =1 theories with quartic superpotentials and their brane
description in type iia and type iib string theories. these theories can be obtained

from n =2 theories by integrating out the adjoint chiral multiplet. if the n =2 theory is
nite, then the resulting n =1 theory has marginal deformations along a line of xed points.
type iia elliptic models have type iib descriptions in terms of branes and orientifolds in
singular backgrounds. we showed that a necessary condition for there to exist a supergravity
description of a theory, namely the equivalence of the weyl and euler anomalies, is satised
in the elliptic models except at special points along the manifold of xed points at which
there are additional massless degrees of freedom, in which case we could not reliably calculate
the anomalies. the condition c  a = 0 also imposes severe restrictions on the types of non-
elliptic models that can have supergravity descriptions: any non-elliptic theory which can
be obtained from type iia brane congurations with vanishing net sixbrane charge and ns5
brane linking numbers does not satisfy the supergravity condition c  a = 0.
