in a one-generation fermion condensate scheme of electroweak symmetry breaking, it is proved
based on the schwinger-dyson equation in real-time thermal eld theory in the fermion bubble
diagram approximation that, at nite temperature t below the symmetry restoration temperature
tc, a massive higgs boson and three massless nambu-goldstone bosons could emerge from spon-
taneous breaking of the electroweak group sul(2)  uy (1)  uq(1) if the two fermion avors
in the one generation are mass degenerate, thus the goldstone theorem is rigorously valid in this
case. however, if the two fermion avors have unequal masses, owing to thermal uctuation, the
goldstone theorem will be true only approximately for a very large momentum cuto  in the zero
temperature fermion loop or for low energy scales. all possible pinch singularities are proved to
cancel each other, as expected in a real-time thermal eld theory.

i. introduction

spontaneous symmetry breaking at nite temperature has been investigated extensively [1-6]. however, most re-
search by now has concentrated on the discussions of phase transition and critical temperature based on the eective
potential approach at nite temperature, and relatively less work is reported about the theoretical exploration of the
nambu-goldstone theorem [7] at nite temperature, especially in models of dynamical symmetry breaking such as the
nambu-jona-lasinio (njl) model with four-fermion interactions [7]. research into the nambu-goldstone mechanism
at nite temperature could provide us a deeper understanding of the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry
at nite temperature and is certainly quite interesting. the key point of such research lies in verifying existence of
nambu-goldstone bosons, i.e., determining the physical masses of the fermionic scalar and pseudoscalar bound states
which appear as the products of spontaneous symmetry breaking. in a model of njl form, the mass determination
can be simply made by using schwinger-dyson equations, i.e., calculating directly the gap equation of fermion mass
and the bound state propagators induced by the four-fermion interactions. on the other hand, it is possible that a
scalar or pseudoscalar bound state is composed of fermions with dierent masses or is a combination of the scalar or
pseudoscalar bilinears of these fermions [8-10]. although a conventional eective potential approach is applicable to
such models if one introduces axialiary scalar elds and replaces the four-fermion interactions by yukawa couplings
between axialiary scalar elds and fermion elds [6], it is unknown, by the introduction of axialiary scalar elds,
whether one could include the eect of the mass dirence of the constituent fermions of a bound state. however,
we believe that the schwinger-dyson equation can surely do that. therefore, to determine directly the masses of
the bound states and to examine fully the eect of the fermion mass dierence at nite temperature, we prefer the
schwinger-dyson equation at nite temperature to a temperature eective potential. all the calculations will be
conducted in the fermion bubble diagram approximation which amounts to the leading order of the 1/n expansion.
since the determination of physical masses of the bound states is the key point of our research; it is certainly more
convenient to take the real-time formalism of thermal eld theory [4] than the imaginary-time formalism. in this way
we will be able to avoid the cumbersome analytic continuation which is necessary in the latter formalism. however,
again, because of the possible mass dierences of the constituent fermions inside the bound states, the use of the
real-time formalism will present a new question, i.e., whether this formalism consistent is with nambu-goldstone
mechanism. in a simple model with ul(n )  ur(n )-invariant four-fermion interactions, it has been proved that in
the real-time formalism of thermal eld theory the nambu-goldstone mechanism works indeed, but it is under the

permanent address.

assumption that the fermions are of equal masses and equal chemical potentials [11]. in this paper, among other
things, to examine further the stated consistency, we will consider a more realistic model  a one-generation fermion
condensate scheme of electroweak symmetry breaking [9]. the extension to the many-generation case [10] is direct.

the paper is arranged as follows. in sec. ii we present the model, give its lagrangian and derive the gap equation
at nite temperature. in secs. iii, iv and v we will respectively calculate propagators of the scalar, the pseudoscalar,
and the charged-scalar bound states at nite temperature by means of the schwinger-dyson equations satised by the
fermionic four-point green functions, determine the bound states masses, and discuss the pinch singularity problem
which is especially related to the real-time formalism of thermal eld theory. finally, in sec. vi we come to our
conclusions.

ii. one-generation fermion condensate model and gap equation

in this model of electroweak symmetry breaking, we have one generation of q fermions forming a sul(2)  uy (1)
doublet (u, d) and are assigned in the representation r of the color group suc(3) with the dimension dq(r). the
symmetry breaking is induced by the eective four-fermion interactions among the q fermions below some high
momentum scale  which, in real-time thermal eld theory, are described by the lagrangian [4,9,10]

are, respectively, the congurations of the physical neutral scalar, neutral pseudoscalar, and charged scalar bound
states which are expressed by physical fermion elds with a = 1. in zero-temperature eld theory, one assumes that
4f will lead to the vacuum expectation value pq=u,d gqqh( qq)(1)i 6= 0 and this will induce spontaneous breaking
ls
of electroweak group. at nite temperature t and in the real-time formalism of thermal eld theory, we will assume
the thermal expectation valuepq=u,d gqqh( qq)(1)it 6= 0, where only the physical elds (a = 1) are considered [12].

we thus obtain the mass of the q fermion,

critical temperature above which eq. (2.9) is no longer valid and thus electroweak symmetry restoration is implied
[12,13]. in view of this, in the following discussion we will assume t < tc so that the gap equation (2.9) can always
be used.

iii. scalar bound state mode

the propagators for fermionic bound states correspond to the four-point green functions of the fermions. since
there exist two types of four-fermion interaction vertices (a = 1, 2) in real-time thermal eld theory, the four-point
green functions will also be a matrix with the row and the column denoted by the index a. the four-point functions

following linear algebraic equations [10]:

hence kq(p) is real and positive denite. the same conclusion is true with hq(p) and sq(p) since the integrands in
eqs. (3.9) and (3.10) are real and positive, but not applicable to rq(p). in addition, we have the inequalities

(mass degenerate), the a will be identical to zero and we still have only a single m0

(3.21)

where (mq)min and (mq)max are, respectively, the minimal and the maximal mass among the q fermions. the

mq(t, q) is now the q-fermion mass at t 6= 0.
(3.10) and (3.11), sq(p) and rq(p) contain the pinch

just expected in real-time thermal eld theory.

a nite temperature completely.

the mass of (+) will be determined by the zero point of the denominator of 
that under what conditions p2  0 is the pole of 
let us discuss this problem in two cases.
(1) mu = md = mq. that is, the two fermion avors in one generation are mass degenerate. in this case, we have
kud(p) = kq(p), hud(p) = hq(p), sud(p) = sq(p), rud(p) = rq(p), eud(p) = 0, and m 2 = 0. thus

(p). an interesting question is
(p) so that  and + would become massless bound states.

(5.15)

q exists. therefore, it follows from eq. (5.14) that p2 = 0 is the single pole of 

which has a form similar to the propagator (4.8) of pseudoscalar bound state except that now no sum of q with the
weight m2
(p) and  and + will
be exactly massless charged bound states  charged nambu-goldstone bosons. in addition, similar to the case of
0
(2) mu 6= md.
in this case, we notice that no pinch singularity could appear. this may also be seen from the
expressions (5.11) and (5.12) of sud(p) and rud(p) in which (l2  m2
d] in the integrands will be
equal to be zero if p = 0 and mu 6= md. therefore, we could calculate the propagator for  on the condition that
the ghost elds with a = 2 are omitted completely and obtain

p , when p  0 the pinch singularities appearing in sq(p) and rq(p) also cancel each other.

equation (5.16) may be obtained approximately from eq. (5.13) by assuming that the momentum cuto  in kud(p)
is large enough to neglect terms containing r2

(p) is determined by the equation

(5.16)

ud(p). the pole of 
eud(p) + i m 2sud(p)

p2 =

(5.17)

equation (5.17) shows that at nite temperature it is possible that the single pole of 
(p) is not at p2 = 0 and
thus the masses of  and + are not equal to zeros. however, it is seen from the right-hand side of eq. (5.17) that
as long as the momentum cuto  is large enough, the single pole of 
(p) could still be approximately at p2 = 0.
in particular, we notice that when p2 = 0 and p0 = |
p |  0, both eud(p) and sud(p) in the numerator of the
right-hand side of eq. (5.17) will approach zeros. this means that at a low energy scale,  and + could still be
considered as massless bound states and identied with charged nambu-goldstone bosons.



vi. conclusions

in this case, we can precisely identify 0

we have expounded electroweak symmetry breaking at nite temperature in a one-generation fermion condensate
scheme in the real-time formalism of thermal eld theory and in the fermion bubble approximation. it is proved by
means of direct calculations of the propagators for bound states that, at the temperature t below the symmetry
restoration temperature tc, it is always possible to obtain a massive neutral scalar bound state 0
s, a massless neutral
p , and two massless charged scalar bound states  and + if the two avors of the
pseudoscalar bound state 0
one generation of fermions are mass degenerate.
s with the higgs boson
and 0
p ,  with the three nambu-goldstone bosons which appear as the products of the spontaneous breaking of
electroweak group sul(2) uy (1)  uq(1). in other words, the goldstone theorem is valid rigorously in the fermion
mass-degenerate case. on the other hand, when the two fermion avors have unequal masses, we have seen that the
higgs boson will show double masses due to the eect of thermal actuation except one of the two avors being
massless, and the two charged scalar bosons  will also not be exactly massless. however, we nd that as long as
the momentum cuto  of the zero-temperature sectors of the fermion loops is suciently large or one is dealing
with low energy scales of the bound states, then it is still possible approximately to obtain a single-higgs-boson mass
and almost massless . in this case we can say that the goldstone theorem is only valid approximately at a nite
temperature. the well-known top-quark condensate scheme [8] certainely belongs to the latter case. whether the
appearence of such a situation originates from the real-time formalism itself of thermal eld theory deserves to be
examined further. nevertheless, our discussions have shown that all possible pinch singularities cancel each other and
do not emerge from the nal expressions and this is just the result expected in a real-time thermal eld theory. it is
worth researching further if the above results based on the schwinger-dyson equation in the real-time formalism of
thermal eld theory could also appear in the imaginary-time formalism or in an eective potential approach.
