(3.7) therefore, type ii case, t-duality type type ia theory manifests isomorphism relative k-theory groups, ko(x s1, s1) = kr1(x s1,1, s1,1), (3.8) whose elements correspond d-brane charges orientifold compactication. isomorphism (3.8) maps rst term relative ko-group (3.5) second term relative kr-group (3.7), vice versa. therefore tempting identify respective terms contributions nine-dimensional d-brane charges coming unwrapped wrapped ten-dimensional d-branes. example, nine-dimensional 0-brane charge type receives z2 contribution unwrapped non-bps d0-brane, z contribution wrapped bps d1-branes. type ia description, receives contributions t-dual congurations, i.e., z2 wrapped non-bps d1-brane, z unwrapped bps d0-branes. however, face it, seems problem interpretation: non-bps d-branes stable radii, therefore cannot contribute conserved charges everywhere moduli space. responsible z2 charges non-bps d-branes unstable? answer question, let us rst recall non-bps d-branes decay. 3.3. d-brane decay consider example non-bps d0-brane type i. spectrum open strings beginning ending d0-brane tachyon-free ten dimensions. com- pactify circle however, ground state winding number 1 classical mass squared given ( = 1) 1 2 + r2, (3.9) therefore become tachyonic r < 1/2. result, d0-brane decay wrapped d1-d1 system. recall, however, describing d0- m2 = brane d1-d1 bound state one requires tachyon (higgs) eld d1-d1 system condense kink. implies anti-periodic boundary conditions tachyon, achieved turning z2 wilson line either d1-brane d1-brane. 9 z2 charge d0-brane lost decays, rather reappears z2-valued wilson line decay products. unwrapped d8-brane d7-brane meet similar fate r < 1/2; decay wrapped d9-d9 d8-d8 system, respectively, also non-trivial z2 wilson line. z dp-brane 2 r r << 1 2 t-dual picture: 1 r = r r d(p+1)-brane r d(p+1)-brane r 2z d(p+1)-brane r >> 2 dp-brane dp-brane fig. 1: decay non-bps d-branes type type ia conversely, t-duality unwrapped non-bps dp-branes become wrapped non-bps d(p + 1)-branes type ia p + 1 = 1, 8, 9. develop tachyon unit momentum dual radius becomes large (r > 2), consequently decay unwrapped dp-dp system restricted orientifold planes. non-trivial z2 wilson line type description reects presence resulting d-brane d-antibrane dierent orientifold planes. conclude type ia picture z2 charge decaying d-brane encoded z2 choice locations decay products. decay processes summarized fig. 1. euclidean wrapped z2 d0-brane z2 d-instanton, compactication circle introduces regions stability moduli space circle, since instantonic congurations, compare values instanton action. 10 3.4. d-brane transfer picture d-brane decay described oers insight resolution another puzzle clearly illustrated type ia picture. r < 2, seem two distinct sources z2 charge associated d0-branes nine-dimensional theory. rst one due possibility locating single d0-brane either orientifold plane, second due stretched non-bps d1-brane. however, k-theory indicates one d0-brane z2 charge. saw above, r > 2 d1-brane decays d0-brane one o8- plane, d0-brane o8-plane. crucial clue resolution puzzle. consider conguration consisting stuck d0-brane (half d0-brane) one orientifold plane wrapped non-bps d1-brane. far conserved d-brane charges concerned, conguration completely equivalent stuck d0-brane orientifold plane, fact unstable decay it. true unwrapped d7 d8-brane. case, d-brane stuck one orientifold plane transferred wrapped d-brane one higher dimension orientifold plane. thus see puzzle missing z2 charges k-theory resolved brane transfer operation (fig. 2). o8- o8- o8 - o8- 1 2 dp-brane z2 d(p+1)-brane brane transfer operation 1 2 dp-brane fig. 2: d-brane transfer operation type ia 3.5. < 9 analysis straightforwardly extended t-duality type theory higher tori. d-brane charges type theory tm correspond relative k-theory group (calculated iterating (a.17)) ko(x tm, tm) = mmp=0 (cid:18) p (cid:19)gkop(x), (3.10) compared corresponding group t-dual side. 11 t-dual orientifold theory iia/ im odd, iib/ im even, im involution (times appropriate factors (1)fl) reects compact dimensions. d-brane charges theories therefore classied relative kr-group krn(x tm, tm) (for n), involution kr-theory acts trivially x, reects dimensions tm. interesting subtlety arises try determine value n corresponds tm. type ia theory, i.e., = 1, one could use alternative string theory denition kr1(x) demonstrate appropriate value n fact n = 1 {$9812135$}. > 1, however, seem option. instead, proceed follows. agreement known spectrum supersymmetric d-branes determines n = mod 4. since bott periodicity ko-theory eight, leaves uncertainty whether n equals + 4. claim correct value n = m, d-brane charges type t-dual models classied relative group indeed, iterating (a.23), using (1, 1) bott periodicity kr-theory, one show krm(x tm, tm). (3.11) krn(x tm, tm) = mmp=0 (cid:18) p (cid:19)gkrn,p(x) = mmp=0 (cid:18) p (cid:19)gkopn(x); coincides (3.10) n = m.3 thus, get t-duality isomorphism (3.12) (3.13) krm(x tm, tm) = ko(x tm, tm). corresponding spectrum bps (z2) stable non-bps d-branes precise agreement degeneracies various wrapped branes. still, precise bookkeeping d-brane charges involve various higher-dimensional analogs brane transfer operation studied above. particularly interesting example, consider classication d-instantons type iib 2/ i2, terms kr2(s8 t2, t2) = z z2 z2 z2. group contains fewer charges naively expected; resolved brane transfer operations, involve objects wrap zero, one, dimensions compact t2. leave details exercise interested reader. 3 heuristically, exponent relevant kr-group fact s1 reection behaves eectively sphere dimension minus one kr-theory: wedge product s1 trivial involution lowers exponent kr-group one, wedge product s1 reection raises exponent one; cf. appendix. 12 4. typeei theories considering theories nine dimensions, exists natural extension type ia involves replacing one two o8 planes o8+ plane {$9810188$}. refer type fia theory. theory requires d8-branes, gauge group, yet still contains interesting non-bps stable d-branes spectrum. demonstrate charges locally stable one type orientifold plane become unstable due possibility moving another type orientifold plane annihilating there. also, stretched z2 charged d-branes longer connected transfer stuck branes one plane other. tachyon backgrounds unstable d9-branes using k-theory. purpose, easier classify possible d-brane charges typefia analyze possible start t-dual type fia, typeei theory. t-dual worked {$9810188$}, consists gauging z2 symmetry iib circle realized composing worldsheet parity reversal () half-circumference shift along circle. natural k-group d-brane charges type ei relative group kr(x s0,2, s0,2).4 since s0,2 circle r2 dimensions reected, involution kr- theory indeed acts s0,2 required shift. type ei k-group, kr(x s0,2), known mathematics literature isomorphic k-group ksc(x) self-conjugate bundles x(see {$9810188$} appendix). bring ksc(x) several nice features. first all, using relation ksc-theory, show relative groups kr(x s0,2, s0,2) = kr4(x s0,2, s0,2).
