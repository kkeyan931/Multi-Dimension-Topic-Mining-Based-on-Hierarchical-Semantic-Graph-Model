1 introduction

in this review you will not nd many general ideas. it is rather meant as a
technical introduction to some basic tools for working with supersymmetric
eld theories. it are ingredients which i could use for various applications in
the last 20 years.

in section 2, i will consider only bosonic theories. it contains an intro-
duction to the spacetime symmetries. also gauging of symmetries is treated,
and special attention is devoted to a very useful theorem for calculating the
transformation of the covariant derivative of elds.

section 3 reviews the properties of cliord algebras and spinors in a
spacetime with arbitrary dimensions and signature. it gives an overview of
majorana, weyl, majoranaweyl and symplectic majoranaweyl spinors.
at the end several tips are given to perform complex conjugation in practice,
and to manipulate gamma matrices.

supersymmetry is introduced in section 4. i introduce especially the al-
gebraic approach. also the elementary facts on superalgebras are treated,
including the real forms of these algebras. the aim is to come to supersym-
metry algebras, as well super-poincare, as super-ads and superconformal
algebras.

2 bosonic spacetime symmetries

supersymmetry is related to the structure of spacetime. before tackling
supersymmetry algebras, i will rst review the bosonic spacetime symmetries
and their gauging.

2.1 colemanmandula result

to investigate possible spacetime symmetries, coleman and mandula [1] in-
vestigated how large the spacetime symmetry group can be in order that
scattering amplitudes do not become trivial. they thus deal with visible
symmetries, i.e. those which act on s-matrix elements. they restrict them-
selves also to 4 dimensions, and assume a nite number of dierent particles
in a multiplet. their research was before the advent of supersymmetry, so
they were looking only at bosonic symmetries. still the result is very signif-
icant. there are two cases to be distinguished.

2

1. there are massive particles. then the symmetry algebra has at most
translations p, lorentz rotations m and an algebra g of scalar (i.e. com-
muting with p and m) symmetries.
2. there are only massless particles. then there is the extra possibility of
having conformal symmetry (and a commuting group g).

the second possibility will be discussed in section 2.3. the rst one

contains a direct sum of g with the poincare algebra, i.e.

[m, m ] = 2[
[p, m ] = [p] ,

[m]

] ,

[p, p ] = 0 .

(2.1)

for conventions, see appendix a. in supersymmetry the last commutator is
often modied, giving rise to the (anti) de sitter algebra.

2.2 anti-de sitter algebra and spacetime

the poincare algebra is an inonuwigner contraction of the (anti) de sitter
algebra:

[m, m] = [m]  [m]
[p, m] = [p]

[p, p] =

1
2r2 m .

(2.2)

with the opposite sign for the last commutator we would have the de sitter
algebra. as written it is the anti-de sitter (ads) algebra. and for r  ,
we recover the poincare algebra. dening md = md = r p we have
generators m = m  with  = 0, . . . , d, and dening the metric to be
 = diag( + . . . + ) the algebra can be concisely written as

[m, m] = [m]  [m] ,

(2.3)

i.e. it is the algebra so(d  1, 2). note that every point is invariant under
the rotations around this point, while not invariant under the translations.
in this sense we can write

adsd =

so(d  1, 2)
so(d  1, 1)

.

3

(2.4)

the inonuwigner contraction is the statement that the so(d  1, 2)
algebra reduces to the poincare algebra when taking the limit r   keeping
p constant in the relation md = md = r p.
to obtain a space with ads metric, we start from dening it as a subman-
ifold of a (d + 1)-dimensional space with a at metric of (d  1, 2) signature
(for convenience we taken here  = 0, . . . , d  2)
ds2 = dx dx   dx +dx 

(2.5)

(d  2, 1) +

(1, 1)  (d  1, 2)

the ads space is the submanifold determined by the so(d  1, 2)-invariant
equation
(2.6)

x x   x +x  + r2 = 0 .

on the hypersurface one can take several sets of coordinates. e.g. the horo-
spherical coordinates {x, z} are dened by

x  = z1
x  = z1x

x + =

 + r2z2
x2

z

.

(2.7)

the latter being the solution of (2.6) given the rst two. the induced metric
on the hypersurface is

ds2 =

1

z2 (cid:16)dx2

 + r2dz2(cid:17) .

(2.8)

the so(d  1, 2) is linearly realized in the embedding (d + 1)-dimensional
space, and these transformations, ( = , +, and  =  )

x  =  m x  = 

x  .

(2.9)

are on the ads space distorted to1

adsx = 
adsz = z(cid:16)+

  x  +
+(cid:17) .

(x2 + r2z2)
+  2x

+x

+ + 2xx

+

(2.10)
1note that to raise or lower indices one has to use the metric in (2.5), i.e. + =  1
2 ,

and thus + = 2.

4

suppose i just gave you the metric (2.8). then to determine the symme-

tries, one should solve the killing equation (with x m = {x, })

(p gm n )x p + 2gp (m n )x p = 0 ,

(2.11)

which is the requirement that the lie derivative of the metric vanishes. as an
exercise, one may prove that the transformations (2.10) are the only solutions.

2.3 rigid conformal symmetry

conformal symmetry is dened as the symmetry which preserves angles.
therefore it should contain the transformations which change the metric up
to a factor. that implies that the symmetries are determined by the solutions
to the conformal killing equation

()  1

d  = 0 .

(2.12)

in d = 2 with as non-zero metric elements z z = 1, the killing equations are
reduced to zz = zz = 0 and this leads to an innite dimensional conformal
algebra (all holomorphic vectors z(z) and anti-holomorphic vectors z(z)).
in dimensions d > 2 the conformal algebra is nite-dimensional. indeed, the
solutions are

(x) = a + 

m x + dx + (x2

k  2xx  k) .

(2.13)

corresponding to the parameters a are the translations p, to 
m corre-
spond the lorentz rotations m, to d are associated dilatations d, and

k are parameters of special conformal transformations k. this is ex-
pressed as follows for the full set of conformal transformations c:

c = ap + 

m m + dd + 

kk .

(2.14)

with these transformations, one can obtain the algebra with as non-zero
commutators

] ,

[m]

[m, m ] = 2[
[p, m ] = [p] ,
[p, k ] = 2(d + 2m) ,
[d, p ] = p ,

5

[k, m ] = [k] ,

[d, k ] = k .

(2.15)

this is the so(d, 2) algebra2. indeed one can dene

m  =

4(p   k )

4(p  + k )

4(p   k )

,

(2.16)

where indices are raised w.r.t. the rotation matrices m 
 with the metric
 = diag (1, 1, ..., 1,1). note that this is the same as the anti-de sitter
algebra in d + 1 dimensions

confd = adsd+1 ,

(2.17)

(obviously this concerns the algebras, not the spaces) which is an essential
ingredient in the ads/cft correspondence which got recently so much at-
tention. note in this respect the similarity between (2.10) and (2.13).

in general, elds i(x) in d dimensions have the following transformations

under the conformal group:

ci(x) = (x)i(x) + 

+wi d(x) i(x) + 

i

m (x) m

jj(x)
k (k)i (x) ,

(2.18)

where the x-dependent rotation m (x) and x-dependent dilatation d(x)
are given by

m (x) = [] = m   4x[k ] ,

d(x) = 1

d = d  2x  k .

(2.19)

to specify for each eld i its transformations under conformal group one
has to specify:

i) transformations under the lorentz group, encoded into the matrix

(m)i

j. the lorentz transformation matrix m should satisfy

i

m

km

k

j  m

i

km

k

j = [m]

i

j + [m]

(2.20)

the explicit form for lorentz transformation matrices is for vectors
(the indices i and j are of the same kind as  and )

m

(2.21)
2in the 2-dimensional case so(2, 2) = su (1, 1)  su (1, 1) is realised by the nite
subgroup of the innite dimensional conformal group, and is well known in terms of l1 =

(2.22)

ii) the weyl weights wi.

iii) possible extra parts of the special conformal transformations,
apart from those connected to translations, rotations and dilatations
as in (2.13) and (2.19), (k)i. the weyl weight of (ki) should be
w  1, and k are mutually commuting operators.
in this way, the algebra (2.15) is realised on the elds as

[c(1), c(2)] = c ( = 

2 

1  

1 

2 ) .

(2.23)

note the sign dierence between the commutator of matrices (2.20) and the
commutator of the generators in (2.15), which is due to the dierence between
active and passive transformations. to understand fully the meaning of
the order of the transformations, consider in detail the calculation of the
commutator of transformations of elds. see e.g. for a eld of zero weyl
weight, and notice how the transformations act only on elds, not on explicit
spacetime points x:

da[d, p](x) = (d(d)p (a)  p (a)d(d)) (x)
= d(d)a(x)  p (a)dx(x)
= a (dx) (x)
= ad(x) = dap(x) .

(2.24)

it is important to notice that the derivative of a eld of weyl weight w
has weight w + 1. e.g. for a scalar of weight w (and without extra special
conformal transformations) we obtain

c(x) = (x)(x) + w d(x) (x)

(x)(x) + d(x)(x)  2w k(x) . (2.25)
with these rules the conformal algebra is satised. the question remains
when an action is conformal invariant. we consider local actions which can be

m 

written as s = r ddxl(i(x), i(x)), i.e. with at most rst order derivatives

on all the elds. for p and m there are the usual requirements of a

7

covariant action. for the local dilatations we have the requirement that the
weights of all elds in each term should add up to d, where  counts also
for 1, as can be seen from (2.25). indeed, the explicit d transformations
nally have to cancel with

(x)l  ((x))l = dd(x)l .
for special conformal transformations one remains with

(2.27)


 indicates a right derivative. the rst terms originate from the
where
k-transformations contained in (2.13) and (2.19). in most cases these are
sucient to nd the invariance and no (k) are necessary. in fact, the latter
are often excluded because of the requirement that they should have weyl
weight wi  1, and in many cases there are no such elds available.
although we will show that this condition is satised for many dilatational
invariant theories, it is non-trivial. as a counterexample we give the action
of the scalars 1 and 2 (with weyl weights ( d

2  1))
2! (1)(2) .

exercise.

there are typical cases in which (2.27) does not receive any contributions.

check the following ones

1. scalars with weyl weight 0.

2. spinors appearing as 6  if their weyl weight is (d  1)/2. this is also

the appropriate weight for actions as  6 .

3. vectors or antisymmetric tensors whose derivatives appear only as eld
strengths [1b2...p] if their weyl weight is p1. this value of the weyl
weight is what we need also in order that their gauge invariances and
their zero modes commute with the dilatations. then scale invariance
of the usual square of the eld strenghts will x p = d
2.

8

4. scalars x i with weyl weight d

2  1 and

l = (x i)aij(x j) ,

(2.29)

where aij are constants.

2.4 gauge theory and gravity

from the theory of general relativity we know how to construct actions in-
variant under the local poincare group. however, i will now consider the con-
structions from an algebraic viewpoint, i.e. as a gauge theory of the poincare
group. first, recall the general equations for gauge theories with innitesimal
transformations

 = ata ,

(2.30)

where a thus labels all the symmetries, and a are all the parameters. for
every symmetry one introduces a gauge eld ha

 , and if the algebra is

[a(a

1 ), b(b

c(cid:17) ,

2 )] = c (cid:16)b
2 a

1 fab

then these transform as

()ha

 = a + chb

 fbc

a .

covariant derivatives are dened as

 =   a(ha
 ) ,

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

and their commutators are new transformations with as parameters the cur-
vatures:

[,] = a(ra
)
 = 2[ha

ra

] + hc

 hb

 fbc

a ,

(2.34)

which transform covariantly as

ra

 = crb

fbc

a .

i now apply this to the poincare group with gauge elds

ha
 ta = ea

pa + 

abmab .

9

(2.35)

(2.36)

the indices , , . . . of the algebra of the previous sections should now be re-
placed by at indices a, b, . . .. the curvatures are then (for later convenience
i put an indication p for the poincare curvatures)

(p a) = 2[ea
rp
(m ab) = 2[]

rp

] + 2[

abe]b
 

ab + 2c[a

b]

c .

(2.37)

usually the spin connection is not considered as an independent eld. one
can obtain the relation between the spin connection and the vierbeins by
imposing a constraint

rp

(p a) = 0 .

(2.38)

as the vielbein ea
spin connection

 is assumed to be invertible, this can be solved for the



ab = 2e[a[e]

b]  eaebec[ec
] .

(2.39)

such a constraint, which can be solved for a eld, is called a conventional
constraint. similar constraints are often used in the superspace approach.

the constraint is not invariant under all the symmetries. therefore the
theory with the constraint, and thus a dependent spin connection has an al-
gebra that is dierent from (2.1). essentially the translations pa are replaced
by covariant general coordinate transformations

cgct() = gct()  i (hi

) ,

(2.40)

where i stands for all transformations except the translations. in fact, one
can check that the translations pa on the vierbein take the form of general
coordinate transformations, due to the constraint (2.38).

from now on we replace translations by these covariant general coordinate
transformations. on non-gauge elds we have (and we write these equations
again more general than for the pure poincare algebra, as we want to use it
later for larger algebras containing translations)

 =   ea

pa  i(hi

) = 0 ,

which, solved for pa, gives what is now called the covariant derivative

pa = da  e

a (cid:16)  i(hi

)(cid:17) .

[da, db] = i (ri

(2.43)

(2.44)

while in the original algebra translations did commute, (covariant) general
coordinate transformations do not commute, i.e. f a
ab 6= 0. if one takes this
into account in (2.34), thus adding a new term with f a
, then the full
curvature vanishes, consistent with (2.41). then one can solve this again for
f a
ab, and one obtains

abea

eb

such that still

in the curvature formula (2.34) one thus takes f i
algebra, but the other sums over symmetries include also the translations.

ab = 0, as in the original

the ricci tensor is a contraction of the m-curvature

r = rp

(m ba)eb

ea ,

r = rg ,

(2.45)

and the eld equation of the usual pure poincare action is



g z d4xg r = g (cid:16)r  1

2gr(cid:17) .

(2.46)

in the rigid theory, a scalar does transform under lorentz rotations. in-
deed, see (2.18) where (x) contains a lorentz rotation according to (2.13).
this is not the case in the local theory. here, (x) is the local parameter
for general coordinate transformations. the former rotation is thus part of
the general coordinate transformation.
in the local theory, scalars are in-
variant under lorentz rotations. for other elds, the rotations exclusively
come from the part in mab (and in a conformal theory, the full m (x) is the
local parameter, and the special conformal transformations are not part of
it, but are exclusively contained in (k)). e.g. for a spinor, , the covariant
derivative is (if they do not transform under any other symmetry)

da = e

a (cid:16) + 1
4 

bcbc(cid:17)  .

(2.47)

further it is important to realize that the rotations m ab act on vectors va,
but a local spacetime vector v is invariant. on the other hand, the general
coordinate transformation on v has not just the v term, but also the
term v.

the following theorem is extremely useful when calculating transforma-

tions [2, 3].

11

theorem on covariant derivatives. we dene a covariant quantity as
one whose transformation has no derivative on a parameter. in particular, it
has to be a world scalar such that general coordinate transformations on the
eld do not contain a derivative on . if a covariant quantity transforms
only into covariant quantities, then a covariant derivative (2.42) on such a
covariant quantity is a new covariant quantity.
this implies that transformations of a covariant quantity contain only deriva-
tives as covariant derivatives da on other covariant quantities, or in the form
of curvatures with lorentz indices rab.
proof. in this proof we will allow the algebra to be open, see below. first,
we give the conditions again in formulas, which may clarify some of the
sentences in the statement of the proof. recall that the full set of generators
(which correspond to indices a, b, . . .), contain translations (indices a, . . .)
and the remaining transformations are indicated by indices i. gauge elds
of these other symmetries may have transformation laws with other terms
than in (2.32), in particular with matter elds. their transformations under
the (non-translation) symmetries are

hi

 = i + j ha

 faj

i + mhi
 .

(2.48)

the last term can contain covariant matter elds, but not explicit gauge
eld (apart from ea

). consider a matter eld  that transforms as

 = i (ti) ,

(2.49)

which has thus no derivative on i. the requirement that a covariant quantity
transforms in a covariant quantity is the statement that

(ti) = j (tj ti) .

first, consider the transformation of the covariant derivative

the algebra is

d =   hi

ti .

(2.50)

(2.51)

[(1), (2)]  = j

1(cid:16)fij
2 i
2 i
1 [ti, tj}  = j

(2.52)
remark that all formulas have been written in a way that they are also appli-
cable to fermionic transformations (thus the order in which elds and param-
eters are written, is carefully chosen). the symbol [., .} will be introduced

ktk + fij

ada + ij(cid:17) .

12

later in (4.3) the commutator can include general coordinate transforma-
tions, which act on the  as da = e
ad. furthermore,  is a possible
non-closure term. the previous formulas imply

consider now the transformation of (2.42), using

then the rst term on the last line of (2.53) is cancelled and we obtain

(2.55)

consider the nal result.
in the second term the index a is used, which
may take the value a, with ta = da. otherwise, this term appears whenever
a gauge eld hi
 has in its transformation law a term which is proportional
to the vielbein ea
. as in our terminology on covariant quantities we did not
consider the vierbein as a gauge eld, this term can be included in mhi
. thus
for closed algebras (ji = 0) the result is as follows: in the transformation
of the covariant derivative, the derivative should not work on the parameter,
and further terms appear only from the transformation of gauge elds that
are not proportional to gauge elds. thus gauge elds never appear naked
in such transformations. one only has to be careful here that the vielbein is
not considered as a gauge eld itself.

e.g. consider the calculation of the transformation of (2.47). first of all,
remark that this would not work for d, which is not a covariant quantity.
then, the transformations of the spin connection bc
 can be neglected as this
eld transforms only in the derivative of a parameter or in an explicit gauge
eld, and the latter do not appear in the nal result due to the theorem. we
do have to take into account that the vielbein transforms as

where the . . . stand for e.g. a term ea
it contains a derivative on the parameter. the nal result is thus

ea

(2.57)

this shows the usefulness of the theorem: although in intermediate steps we
omitted some terms, at the end we obtain the full result.

2.5 local conformal transformations

we now consider the gauging of the conformal algebra, and show how poincare
gravity is recovered in a gauge for dilatations and special conformal trans-
formations. the gauge elds are introduced as

 ta = ea

(2.58)

the curvatures are

r(p a) = rp
r(m ab) = rp
r(d) = 2[b]  4f a
r(k a) = 2[f a

the conventional constraint (2.38) could be imposed because the gauge eld
ab
 appears in the curvature multiplied by the invertible vielbein. consider-
ing the curvatures, one can see that also the gauge eld f a
 appears in such a
way in the curvatures of d and m. it can be solved if we impose as second
conventional constraint:

r(p a) = 0
r(m ab)e

b = 0 .

(2.60)

therefore as well ab
 are dependent elds. in the rst one there is a
modication to (2.39) due to the term proportional to b. the solution for
the k gauge eld is (with the denitions as in (2.45))

it is interesting to compare transformations of derivatives of elds in
the rigid theory with those of covariant derivatives in conformal gravity. in
(2.25) the second line came from the derivatives of  (rst two terms) and
the derivative of d.
in the gauge theory, the full x-dependent (x) is
the parameter of general coordinate transformations. show, with the help
of the theorem on covariant derivatives, how one re-obtains (2.25) with all
derivatives replaced by covariant ones (and changing to a-indices).

show that also in the local theory, (2.27) is the rule to determine whether
the action with ordinary derivatives replaced by covariant derivatives, is an
invariant.
the transformation law of a covariant derivative determines the covariant
box

the latter is the well-known r/6 term in d = 4. in fact, choosing w = d
one has a conformal invariant scalar action

(2.64)

exercise: show that r ddx edada is not invariant. how does the dierence

between this statement and the one in (2.29) occur?

consider now that we want a poincare invariant action. then we have
to break dilatations and special conformal transformations, as these are not
part of the poincare algebra. considering (2.62) it is clear that the latter
can be broken by a gauge choice

k  gauge :

b = 0 .

(2.65)

therefore, of the weyl multiplet (the multiplet of elds with the gauge
elds of the conformal algebra), only the vielbein remains. one could take
as gauge choice for dilatations a xed value of a scalar . and one easily
checks that then the action (2.64) reduces to the poincare gravity action.

3 spinors in arbitrary dimensions

i now present information about the cliord algebra and spinors in arbitrary
dimensions. i will discuss arbitrary signatures of spacetime. dierent from
many other treatments, i will not consider arguments of eld theory. e.g. in
many other papers one uses that spinors are solutions of the dirac equation.
that is also the case in [4], which is however the rst reference for the facts
that i will recall.

3.1 gamma matrices and their symmetry

i consider arbitrary spacetime dimensions d = t+s, with t timelike directions
and s spacelike directions, and consider the general facts of cliord algebras
and spinors, as has been done rst in [5].

the cliord algebra is

ab + ba = 2ab ,

(3.1)

where  = diag( . . .+ . . . +), writing rst the timelike directions and then
the spacelike ones.
i rst give a representation of the cliord algebra for signature (0, d)

(only spacelike) in terms of  matrices

1 0 !
1 =   0 1

0 !
2 =   0 i

i

3 =   1

0 1 ! .

(3.2)

the only relevant properties are 12 = i3 and cyclic, and that they square
to 2 and are hermitian.

1 = 1    . . .
2 = 2    . . .
3 = 3  1   . . .
4 = 3  2   . . .
5 = 3  3  1  . . .
. . . = . . . .

(3.3)

this is for even dimensions a representation of dimension 2d/2. for odd
dimensions, e.g. d = 5, one does not need the last 1 factor in 5, and the

16

dimension is still 2(d1)/2. these matrices are all hermitian.
if there are
t timelike directions, we just have to multiply the rst t matrices in the
representation above by i. e.g. for the minkowski case 1 = i1   . . ..
thus we get as hermiticity property for timelike and spacelike directions


t = t ,



s = s ,

or in general

a = ()taaa1 ,


a = 1 . . . t .

(3.4)

(3.5)

of course the realization given above is not unique. one preserves (3.1) with

 = u 1u .

(3.6)

to respect also (3.4), u has to be unitary. a further remark on the uniqueness
will follow in footnote 5.

another important fact is that in even dimensions a complete set of

2d/2  2d/2 matrices is provided by {(n)} with n = 0, 1, . . . d, and

(n) = a1...an  [a1a2 . . . an] .

(3.7)

the last matrix (d), we write as3

 = (i)d/2+t1 . . . d ,

 = 1 ,

(3.8)

where the normalization is chosen such that the last equation holds in any
case.  is independent on the signature of spacetime, in the sense that when
i introduced rst the  matrices in euclidean signature, and then went to an
arbitrary signature, i multiplied the rst t gamma matrices by i. this drops
out again by the multiplication by (i)t in (3.8). in the representation (3.3),
 is
(3.9)

 = 3  3  3  . . . .

for even dimensions we have (the levicivita tensor  is dened in ap-
pendix a)

a1...an =

a1...adid/2+tad...an+1 .

(3.10)

3if 0 is used as label of the time direction in minkowski space, then we have  =

1

(d  n)!

(i)d/2+101 . . . d1.

17

note that  anticommutes with a and can thus be used as d+1 in the next,
odd dimension. in odd dimensions the product of all  matrices gives 1
or i, and a basis is formed by (n) with n = 0, 1, . . . , (d  1)/2.
there is always a charge conjugation matrix c, such that

ct = c ,

t
a = cac1 ,

(3.11)

for  = 1 and  = 1. a formal proof can be found in [4, 5], but i prove it
here by giving two possibilities in the representation (3.3) for even dimensions

c+ = 2  1  2  1  . . .
c = 1  2  1  2  . . .  c+

 = +1
 = 1 .

(3.12)

note that they satisfy c = c = c1. for odd dimensions, only one of the two
can be used, see table 1 below. if one changes the representation as in (3.6),
then, to preserve (3.11), the charge conjugation matrix should transforms as

c = u tcu .

(3.13)

therefore you see that the unitarity, c = c1, is true in any representation,
but the charge conjugation not necessarily squares to .
we will now deduce which signs of the two variables  and  are allowed

for each value of s and t. first remark that

(cid:16)c(n)(cid:17)t

= ()n(n1)/2()nc(n) .

(3.14)

this has a periodicity of n  n+4. this periodicity implies that the number
of symmetric matrices should be the sum of lines of the following formulae

0! + d

1! + d

(3.16)

for odd dimensions, there is a unique solution. for even dimensions, two of
the lines in (3.15) are equal, and there are thus two possibilities for which
matrices are symmetric. this corresponds to the two possibilities for the
charge conjugation matrix in that case. the result is given in table 1.

this determines signs of  and .

exercise

check with the explicit representation the signs of  and  for the two
possible charge conjugation matrices in 4 dimensions. then consider the fth
gamma matrix, and see that the (3.11) only holds for one choice of c.

3.2

irreducible spinors

we still do not know whether the spinor is irreducible. there are two types
of projections that one can envisage. the rst is only for even dimensions,

19

where we have  available as in (3.8). we can thus dene left and right
spinors. for deniteness we take

l = 1

2 (1 + )  ,

r = 1

2 (1  )  .

(3.17)

e.g. in four dimensional minkowski space (s = 3, t = 1) we dene4

5 =  = i0123 ,

l = 1

2(1 + 5) ,

r = 1

2(1  5) .

(3.18)

the second possible projection is a reality condition. consider rst the

reality properties of the  matrices. combining (3.5) and (3.11), we have5


a = ()tbab1 ,

bt = ca1 .

as a and c are unitary, we nd that also b is unitary. one obtains

bb = t()t(t+1)/2 .

(3.19)

(3.20)

to prove this equation, see rst that internal consistency of (3.5) implies that

at = tca1c1 = ()t(t+1)/2tcac1 .

let us now try to put a reality condition on spinors

 = b ,

(3.21)

(3.22)

for some matrix b. first of all we want consistency with lorentz transfor-
mations, i.e. taking the lorentz transformation of both sides

4 ab(cid:17)
(cid:16) 1
babb1 b = bab ,

=  1

bab

4

and therefore we take

b = b .



(3.23)

(3.24)

4for 4 dimensional minkowski space we write 0,. . . , 3 in stead of 1,. . . ,4.
5here we can give some remark on the uniqueness of the cliord algebra representation.
it is clear that  can also be used as representations of the cliord algebra. the
equation (3.19), which for even dimensions holds for two possibilities of , implies that in
even dimensions these representations are unitary equivalent with the original one. the
fact that for odd dimensions only one sign of  can be used implies that in odd dimensions
there are two unitary inequivalent representations.

20

for consistency,  = , (3.22) implies that b b = 1. combining this with
(3.20) gives || = 1 and the right hand side of (3.20) should be 1. it
turns out that this condition is satised for

s  t = 0, 1, 7 mod 8
s  t = 2 mod 8 with  = +1
s  t = 6 mod 8 with  = 1 .

(3.25)

exercise: check that this can be summarized as: the charge conjugation is
symmetric in an euclidean space with s  t spacelike dimensions.
in these cases, we can thus dene a reality condition as in (3.22), and such
spinors will be denoted as majorana spinors. another way of expressing
the majorana condition is that the majorana conjugate equals the dirac
conjugate. they are respectively
  tc ,

c  a1 .

(3.26)

majorana spinors can thus be thought as spinors 1 + i2, where 1 and
2 have real components, but these are related by the above condition. the
exact value , if it is of modulus 1, is irrelevant for our purpose here. however,

to this issue in section 3.4.

it determines whether e.g.  or r ddx  6 is hermitian. we will come back
consider now that the right had side of (3.20) is not 1, thus 1. then
there is still another possibility if we have extended supersymmetry. indeed,
then one can dene a symplectic majorana condition



i  (cid:16)i(cid:17)

= bijj ,

(3.27)

where  is some antisymmetric matrix, with  = 1. this is e.g. the way
to have real spinors in d = 6 minkowski space.
having two projections, to chiral spinors and to majorana spinors, one
may ask whether they can be combined, i.e. can we dene a reality condition
respecting the chiral projection. as () = ()d/2+tbb1 the condition is
that d/2 + t = 0 mod 2, i.e.

mw spinor : s  t = 0 mod 4 .

(3.28)

of time directions (modulo 4). m stands for majorana spinors. for even
dimensions, m  indicates which sign of  should be used. mw indicates the
possibility of majoranaweyl spinors. for even dimensions one can always
have weyl spinors. symplectic majorana spinors are always possible when
the majorana condition is not possible. smw indicates the possibility of
symplectic majoranaweyl spinors. the number indicates the real dimension
of the minimal spinor.

3.3

4 dimensions

as an example take the minkowski space in 4 dimensions. in order to have
majorana spinors we choose  = 1, and hence  = 1. there exists a majorana
representation where the matrices  are real:

3

0 = (cid:18) 0
0 (cid:19) ,
3
0  2(cid:19) ,
3 = (cid:18) 2

0

1 = (cid:18) 0
 2
0 (cid:19) ,
 2
5 = (cid:18) 0 i1
0 (cid:19) .
i1

2 = (cid:18) 0 i2

0 (cid:19) ,

i2

(3.29)

the charge conjugation matrix is proportional to 0, say c = z0, with
|z| = 1. as a = 0, the majorana condition is  = z. thus with an
appropriate choice of signs, z = 1, majorana spinors are just pure real
spinors in this basis.

22

in another representation that i present now, 5 is diagonal. that basis is
useful to have manifestly chiral spinors. these are then just spinors that have
only two upper components a, while antichiral have two lower components,
denoted as  a, (where a and a can be 1 or 2). the explicit realization is
0 = (cid:18) 0
0  2(cid:19) . (3.30)

5 = (cid:18) 2

(3.31)

this basis makes the connection to the 2-component formalism easy. in that
formulation, indices are raised or lowered with  in a nw-se convention

a = abb ,

a = bba ,

(3.32)

which implies abbc = a
( a,  a) is then

c, and the majorana condition for a spinor

a = ( a) .

(3.33)

i do not use this convention, but use chiral spinors, avoiding the indices.

3.4 technical tips

3.4.1 complex conjugation

to consider complex conjugation in practice, it is useful to consider the op-
eration c, dened by

this is thus chosen such that the majorana spinors are those for which c =
. note that the bar operation, dened by the rst equation of (3.26), on

c  1b1 .

(3.36)

23

c gives c as dened in the second equation of (3.26). the square of this
operation gives the identity (c)c =  if the right hand side of (3.20) is 1.
in case that this is 1, we should modify the denition of the c operation
similar to (3.27). one can check, using (3.21), that

 = tcb1 .

(3.37)

we are now equipped to discuss complex conjugation of bi-spinors. first
of all, we still have to determine whether complex conjugation changes the
order of fermions or not.
in fact, both types of complex conjugation are
possible. i introduce a new sign factor to reect this choice, say . thus for
two fermionic quantities,

() =  =  ,

 = 1 .

(3.38)

consider now the complex conjugation of m, where m is some matrix in
spinor space. with the previous equations one easily nds

( m) = 2t cb1m bc .

(3.39)

we can thus choose in any case  appropriate in order that e.g.  is real.
then we dene m c  b1m b, thus e.g.
c
 = ()d/2+t ,

c
a = ()ta

(3.40)

the latter for even dimensions.
rule: to perform complex conjugation of a bispinor, rst add a factor 2t
and then replace elds and matrices by their c-conjugates, for which (3.40)
gives the important relations.

as an example consider minkowski spaces where  =  = 1, thus in
dimensions d = 2, 3, 4 mod 8, containing 4, 10 and 11 dimensions. we
choose  according to the convention on complex conjugation of bi-spinors
as 2 = 1. then (3.39) implies that we can perform complex conjugation
by using the c operation. majorana spinors are thus considered as just real,
and the same applies for the ordinary gamma matrices. however 5, the
 in 4 dimensions, behaves as a pure imaginary matrix. in 10 dimensions
this matrix can also be considered as real, which reects the possibility of
majoranaweyl spinors in that dimension.
exercise:

24

see how this should be set up in the case of symplectic majorana spinors.

in extended supergravity in 4 dimensions, the chirality is indicated by the
position of the i, j index (index running over 1, . . . n for n-extended super-
gravity). see e.g. (4.6). the choice of chirality for the spinor with an upper
(lower) index can change for each spinor. it is chosen conveniently on the
rst occurrence of the spinor. with the rules of the c operation, we see that
h.c. eectively interchanges upper and lower indices. the chiral spinor qi is
not a majorana spinor. check that (qi)c = qi.

3.4.2 gamma matrix manipulations

i still give some useful identities for calculations in arbitrary dimensions [6].
for a product of two antisymmetrized gamma matrices, one can use

i+j

xk=|ij|

a1...aib1...bj =

s = 1

2(i + j  k) ,

i!j!
s!t!u!

t = 1

[b1
[ai    bs
2(i  j + k) ,

at+1a1...at]

bs+1...bj]

(3.41)

u = 1

2(i + j + k) .

in [6] a few extra rules are given and a diagrammatic technique is explained
that is based on the work of kennedy [7].

for contractions of repeated gamma matrices, one has the formula

b1...bka1...ab1...bk = ck,a1...a
min(k,)
xi

ck, = ()k(k1)/2k!()k

i! d  
 

k  i!()i ,

(3.42)

for which tables were given in [6] in dimensions 4, 10, 11 and 12, and which
can be easily obtained from a computer programme.

further, there is the fierz relation. we know that the gamma matrices
are matrices in dimension  = 2int d/2, and that a basis of    matrices
is given by the set

{ , a, a1a2, . . . , a1...a[d]}

where

( [d] = d
for even d
[d] = (d  1)/2 for odd d ,
(3.43)

25

of which only the rst has nonzero trace. this is the basis of the general
fierz formula for an arbitrary matrix m in spinor space:

[d]

m

 =

()k(k1)/2 1

k! (a1...ak )

xk=0

 tr (a1...ak m) .

(3.44)

more useful fierz identities can be found in [7].

3.4.3 spinor indices

in these notes, i mostly omit spinor indices. however, in some applications,
this is dicult to accomplish or one prefers spinor indices. i will give here a
way to include spinor indices in a practical way, independent of the dimension
of spacetime. first of all, spinors get a lower spinor index. so for a spinor , i
write . gamma matrices act on these spinors, and therefore the expression
. note the position of the spinor indices on a usual
a becomes (a)
gamma matrix. this is then the same for products of gamma matrices.

then i want to be able to raise and lower indices. indeed, e.g. to discuss
 can not be used, as we can not
symmetries of gamma matrices, the (a)
interchange upper and lower indices. to that purpose, i introduce matrices
c and c, which will be related to the charge conjugation matrix below.
the convention that i adopt, is that i raise and lower indices always in the
northwestsoutheast (nw-se) convention. that means that the contrac-
tion indices should appear in that relative position, i.e.

 = c ,

 = c .

in order for these two equations to be consistent, we should have

cc = 
 ,

cc = 
 .

(3.45)

(3.46)

i choose the identications such that the majorana conjugate  is written
as . comparing (3.45) and (3.26), we conclude that c is ct , and c
is then c1. one may check that the symmetries of c(n) or (n)c1, which
were discussed before, is now the symmetry of (a) or (a).
exercise : check that  =  =  where the sign is , i.e. +()
if the charge conjugation matrix is (anti)symmetric. the same is true for
spinor indices at any place: (a)

 = (a).

4 supersymmetry algebras

4.1 haag lopuszanskysohnius result as introduction

after the introduction with bosonic symmetries, and the recapitulation of
spinor properties, i can nally consider fermionic symmetries. this means
that the parameters of some transformations can be anticommuting numbers.
for the generators we then have anticommutators rather than commutators.
indeed, consider

(4.1)
for anticommuting parameters a and hence operators qa, which i will denote
further as odd, distinguishing them from the bosonic even operators. we
have then

() = aqa ,

[(1), (2)] = b

2 a

1 (qaqb + qbqa)  b

2 a

1 {qa, qb} .

(4.2)

here, i introduced a notation for the anticommutator, and i also introduce
a general notation

[ta, tb} = tatb  ()abtbta .

(4.3)

the notation [,} is a commutator except when both operators are odd, when
it is an anticommutator. in the notation ()a one should thus understand
a as an even number, e.g. 0, if ta is even, and a as an odd number, e.g. 1,
if ta is odd.

these algebras should also satisfy a jacobi identity. keeping the param-
eters in place, such a jacobi identity takes the same form as the pure bosonic
one:

removing the parameters, signs appear, but an easy form to remember is

[[ta, tb} , tc} = [ta, [tb, tc}}  ()ab [tb, [ta, tc}} .

(4.5)

the last sign factor just reects the symmetry of the commutator in the
left-hand side.

these denitions lead to a lot of extensions of algebras. we will come
back to the mathematical part in section 4.6. first we consider the phys-
ical input. as a generalisation of the result of [1], reviewed in section 2.1,
haag,  lopuszansky and sohnius [8] considered the same question allowing

27

ha
1 ta,hb

2 tb, c

3 tcii + cyclic in 1, 2, 3 = 0 .

(4.4)

for fermionic symmetries. as for [1], their result contained two parts: one
general possibility (which we will label as the super-poincare algebra), and
one for massless elds only, the superconformal algebras. an important part
of their result is that super-poincare algebras may contain central charges,
which we will discuss in section 4.4. they did suppose a at space, but we
are also interested in the possibility of a curved space, i.e. the super-(anti)
de sitter algebras.

first i will give some qualitative remarks on supersymmetry in general.
then i will consider the super-poincarealgebras, rst without central charges
in section 4.3, then with central charges in section 4.4. i will turn to super-
anti-de sitter algebras in section 4.5, but will have to interrupt that analysis
to give an overview of simple superalgebras in general (section 4.6). finally
i will turn to the superconformal algebras in section 4.7.

4.2 basic properties of poincare supersymmetry

in general the algebra contains respectively the poincare, conformal or (anti)
de sitter algebra, and a number of (lorentz) scalar generators on the even
side, and spin-1/2 odd generators. for the poincare case these are generators
qi
, where  is a spinor index, and i is a representation index for some part
of the bosonic scalar generators outside of the poincare algebra. remember
that the whole discussion here is in 4 dimensions, where the spinors can be
split in a left and a right chirality, which we indicate by the position of the
i index:

qi

 = 1

2(1  5)

qi

 ,

qi = 1

2 (1 + 5)

qi .

their anticommutator takes the form

{qi

, qj} = (cid:16)c1(cid:17)

pi
j ,

(4.6)

(4.7)

and i will return to the meaning of the charge conjugation matrix, c, in
section 3. this is the dening relation of supersymmetries: they square to
the translations. one of the consequences is that it has a dimension 1/2,
where the dimension of translations is conventionally taken to be 1, i.e. as a
mass dimension. so e.g. if a scalar  of dimension 1 transforms in a fermion6

6spinor indices are deleted, and details of the notation will follow later.

q =  ,

(4.8)

28

then, as  has dimension 1/2, the dimension of  is 1/2 higher than that of ,
and its supersymmetry transformation contains  always with a derivative or
a mass. of course, in minimal actions of scalars and spinors, the former have
dimension 1, and the latter 3/2, so we are not unhappy with this conclusion.
theorem: there are an equal number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of
freedom in any realization of the supersymmetry algebra when translations
are an invertible operation.
consider the commutator (4.7) on the space of all bosons. the rst q trans-
forms the space to a space of fermions, while the second one brings us back
to bosons, translated by p.

bosons

q

 fermions

q

 bosons translated by p

the latter is an invertible operator, which proves that the last space is as
large as the rst one, and thus also the middle one, the space of the fermions
has the same dimension. this proves the well-known fact that there are an
equal number of bosonic and of fermionic states. it should hold when the
algebra (4.7) holds. so this equality of bosonic and fermionic states should
hold e.g. for on-shell states, but also for o-shell states if the algebra is also
realized o-shell. on the other hand, it is not a general fact of a superalgebra.
one needs the invertibility of the square of fermionic generators. this does
not hold for massless states in an euclidean spacetime, or in 1 dimension.
in these cases the p 2 = 0 condition for a massless state implies p = 0, and
there is thus no invertibility.

4.3 super-poincare algebras

now we can study the superalgebras which are important in supersymmetry.
i start with the result of [8] in 4 dimensions. apart from the bosonic poincare
algebra (2.1), and the dening relation of supersymmetry (4.7), there is of
course the statement that the supersymmetries are spinors under the lorentz
group7:

[m, qi

 ] =  1

4 ()

qi

 .

(4.9)

the supersymmetries may also rotate under an automorphism group ta:

[ta, qi

 ] = (ua)i

jqj

 ,

[ta, qi ] = (ua)i

jqj .

(4.10)

7 as the reader probably already noticed, we denote  matrices in 4 dimensions as 

29

the latter equation is obtained from the former by complex conjugation,
thus the complex conjugate of (ua)i
j, consistent with
the rule mentioned at the end of section 3.4.1. the jacobi identity [t t q]
implies that these matrices form a representation of the algebra of the ta.
and as ta has to commute with p, as follows already from the coleman
mandula result, it is easy to check that the [t qiqj] jacobi identity implies
that

j is denoted as (ua)i

.

(4.11)

(ua)i

j = (ua)j

i  (cid:16)(ua)j

i(cid:17)

thus these are unitary matrices and the automorphism group is u(n), for
i = 1, . . . , n.

we can make a general statement about the isometry groups in view of
table 2. the 4-dimensional t = 1 example is general for even dimensions
where no majoranaweyl spinor is possible, thus indicated by m in the ta-
ble. then the automorphism group is u(n).
in fact, in this formulation
we have not used the majorana property, but rather the weyl-spinor for-
mulation. in all even dimensions we can use weyl spinors, and this leads
to spinors of the same dimension as the majorana ones (they are the same
in another notation). if we would have the possibility of majoranaweyl,
then there is an extra reality condition, and we have two factors as automor-
phism groups of the left and right spinors, i.e. we obtain so(nl) so(nr).
for odd dimensions, we can not use the chiral formulation, and if there are
majorana spinors, the result is so(n).
if there are symplectic majorana
conditions, then the same argument of the jacobi identity [t qq] leads to
the preservation of the symplectic metric, and the automorphism algebra is
thus reduced to usp(n) (even n)8. if there is a smw spinor, then there are
two such factors. in summary, the automorphism groups are obtained from
the entries of table 2:

m and d odd
m and d even
mw

s (empty in table)

smw

: so(n)
: u(n)
: so(nl)  so(nr)
: usp(n)
: usp(nl)  usp(nr) .

(4.12)

we can now write a list of supersymmetry theories in minkowski spaces of

8there is often confusion about the notation of sp groups. we use notation such that

sp(2) is the smallest symplectic group, see section 4.6.

3 spacetime dimensions, pure supergravity does not describe propagating
degrees of freedom and is a topological theory.

copied from [9], gives an overview of possible supersymmetry models9. this
follows mainly from table 2. the limit of 32 supercharges comes from the
requirement that one can not construct eld theories with helicities larger
than 2. i have not explained representations of the algebras, and therefore
can not really prove this. however, one can understand that in 4 dimensions
any supersymmetry raises or lowers the helicity by 1/2. therefore with n = 8
we already ll the whole range from 2 to 2. similarly rigid supersymmetry
models are only possible for n  4, i.e. q  16. we still remark that other
values of q, i.e. q = 12, 20, 24, are also possible in d = 4, but are rarely used.
let me summarize the result for the super poincare algebras in 4 di-
mensions, omitting the automorphisms (as can consistently be done for the
super-poincare case):

[m, m ] = 2[
[p, m ] = [p] ,

[m]

] ,

9note that the theories are not always unique. certainly if one allows arbitrary signs

in kinetic terms for some elds.

remark that we may also consistently remove the lorentz algebra generators
m. thus the algebra is a semi direct sum of the part with p and q only,
with the lorentz algebra and with the automorphism algebra.

let us check the reality property of the anticommutator of 2 supersym-
metries, and generalize to other dimensions and signatures. complex conju-
gation gives

2bn(qi)c, (qj)co bt = ()tbc 1bt tp  ,

(4.14)

where spinor indices are implicit. the factor  results from the fact that
complex conjugation may changes the order of fermions if  = 1. note
that it does not change the order in which the generators act. thus there
is only that factor, but the operators keep their order. the  spinor index,
which was explicit in (4.7), is at the right side of the equation, and that is
the reason of bt at the end of the left hand side, as q
. for
the right hand side of (4.14), i used

 = qc

 (bt )

c1, = ct = tbc1bt ,

(4.15)

and the bosonic operators are real. remark that if we move the t to the
left hand side, we nd here again the factors of (3.39) and (3.40). such
commutators in general behave as bi-spinors, as one can imagine multiplying
them with spinor parameters at the left and right. thus they follow the rule
mentioned at page 24.

the symmetry of the commutator (and of c1) implies that in the right

hand side in 4 dimensions we can use

n(qi)c, (qj)co = nqi, qjo = nqj, qio .

(4.16)

then the reality consistency is proven if we take (for minkowski spaces with
 = 1) conventions with

2 = 1 .

32

(4.17)

with these methods it is easy to check how this can be generalised to
other dimensions, with other types of spinors. e.g. in d = 11 (minkowski,
t = 1) there are no chiral spinors, and we just have

{q, q} = (cid:16)c1(cid:17)

p .

(4.18)

the reality goes as above, one can just neglect the i indices.

in d = 10 one can have majoranaweyl spinors. for having a similar
{q, q} = p anticommutator, the p  should thus appear in the anticom-
mutator between two supersymmetries of the same chirality. one can ask
in general the question whether one can have the translations p in the
right hand side of the anticommutator between two chiral supersymmetries
{ql, ql}. if that is the case, then

{ql, ql} = 1
= 1

1

2 (1 + )t

2 (1 + ) c1p
4 (1 + )(cid:16)1  ()d/2(cid:17) pc1

= 1

where i used that

t
 = (i)d/2+tt

d . . . t

1 = (i)d/2+tcd . . . 1c1

= ()d/2cc1 .

(4.19)

thus d/2 should be odd, as it is the case in 10 dimensions.
if there is
one such chiral supersymmetry, we denote this as (1, 0) supersymmetry. if
there are two, then this is (2, 0) (which is usually called iib). there can
be two supersymmetries of opposite chirality which is denoted as (1, 1), or
iia supersymmetry. remark that the result (4.19) also checks that in 4
dimensions the p does not appear in the anticommutator of 2 generators of
the same chirality, but, as immediately shown in (4.7), in the anticommutator
of a chiral and an antichiral supersymmetry.
exercise. check that for d/2 even, consistency is obtained if p appears in
the anticommutator of a chiral with an antichiral supersymmetry. further
check that for d/2 odd, the anticommutator of two supersymmetries of the
same chirality can only have (n)c1 for n odd, while for opposite chirality
n should be even. this is reversed for d/2 even.
an important consequence of supersymmetry, which we did not mention yet,
is contained in the positivity statements of the energy. to consider these, we

33

want the anticommutator between a supersymmetry and its complex conju-
gate:

(4.20)

{qi, (qj)} = nqi, (qj)co bt = j

i a1p  ,

where the i, j indices are put as for d = 4, but one can forget them for
e.g. d = 11. the left hand side is real and positive denite if we do not
interchange spinors in complex conjugation ( = 1). then we can choose
 = 1, consistent with (4.17). for  = 1 the left hand side is imaginary,
but  is then an imaginary unit. we can therefore conclude that we can
choose , consistent with (4.17), such that

1 {qi, (qj)}  0 .

(4.21)

as a = 0 in minkowski spaces, this exhibits the positive energy statements
in supersymmetry. for a state at rest, i.e. p  = 
0 m, this implies m  0.

4.4 poincare algebras with central charges

finally we come to an extra possibility, which are the central charges. they
have been found in the classication of haag lopuszanskysohnius [8], and
were realized in the massive (and short) hypermultiplets in [10]. this was
in 4-dimensional minkowski space, to which we will restrict rst, before dis-
cussing the generalization to higher dimensions.

i did not yet give the commutator of two supersymmetries of equal chi-
rality. as i do not want new symmetries with lorentz indices, the general
possibility is

 m

ij zm ,

{qi, qj} = c1

(4.22)
where m labels dierent central charges z m , characterized by independent
antisymmetric matrices m
ij . indeed, the properties of spinors imply that m
ij
should be antisymmetric. now one has to check all jacobi identities, and at
the end one obtains that these z m should commute with all other generators
including the supersymmetries. therefore, these are called central charges.
considering nally [t qq], we nd a restriction on the automorphism group.
indeed, one obtains

ui

kkj  ikuj

k = 0 .

(4.23)

let us consider as an example n = 2. then for ij, there is only ij,
as this is the only antisymmetric tensor. we thus have 1 (complex) central
charge:

{qi, qj} = c1

 ijz .

34

(4.24)

if there is such a central charge, then the automorphism group is not u(2),
but rather the u(1)  u(1) which commutes with ij.
central charges are essential in various application due to the modied
positivity statements. indeed, the modied algebra allows us to obtain an-
other positivity condition.

i will show the argument for n = 2, but it can easily be generalized. the

complex conjugate of (4.24) is10

to diagonalize the set of anticommutators for the supersymmetries, i dene

nqi, qjo = ijcz  .

(4.25)

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

ai  qi + 1eiijc1

 qj ,

where ei is an arbitrary phase factor. the complex conjugate is
ai  (ai) = qi + eiijqjc = eiijajc .

consider now their anticommutators on a state for which p  = 

0 m:

1nai, ajo = j
i 

(2m + zei + z ei) .

as the left hand side is a positive denite operator, the right hand side should
be positive for all , which shows that

m  |z| .

(4.29)

this is an important result, giving a lower limit to the mass, dependent on
the central charge. this is called the bps bound. one can now also see
that if the equality is satised for a state (a bps state), then that state is
invariant under part of the supersymmetry generators. that state preserves
thus part of the supersymmetry. another role of the central charges, is that
one can have supersymmetry multiplets with central charges such that the
bound is saturated. such multiplets have less components than others, and
are therefore called short multiplets. these are the characteristics of algebras
with central charges.

knowing of this possibility of central charges in 4 dimensions, one may
try to generalize it to higher dimensions. one looks again for generators
10i use here qi  (qi). the tensor ij is the same as ij, namely 12 = 12 = 1,

but i write one or the other according to the index structure of the equation.

35

in the {q, q} anticommutator. this was rst considered in the rheonomic
approach to d = 11 supergravity [11], for solving d = 10 super-yangmills
superspace constraints [12], and while looking for superconformal algebras in
higher dimensions [6]. the presence of these operators will lead to positivity
bounds, similar to the one that we found in n = 2, d = 4.

consider as an example d = 11, with one supersymmetry. in the {q, q}

anticommutator one can think of all sorts of objects

{q, q} = xn (cid:16)(n)c1(cid:17)

z(n) .

(4.30)

but of course, the right hand side should also be symmetric. considering
table 1, we see that this restricts us already to n = 1, 2 mod 4, and for an
odd dimension, the independent ones are those up to n = (d  1)/2. this
implies that we have at most

{q, q} = (cid:16)c1(cid:17)

p +(cid:16)c1(cid:17)

z 2

 +(cid:16)c1(cid:17)

z 5

 . (4.31)

the z 2 and z 5 are thus new generators in this anticommutator. in fact, they
are not central in the algebra, i.e. they do not commute with all the other
generators. as they have spacetime indices, they do not commute with the
lorentz rotations. the terminology which is in use, refers to the fact that
these generators have the same physical consequences as the real central
charges in 4 dimensions, i.e. they lead to bps bounds similar to (4.29), with
the limit obtained by states which preserve part of the supersymmetry.

in 4 dimensions the scalar central charges are gauged by a vector, and
the charges are produced by a particle. in 11 dimensions various solutions
produce such charges, e.g. m2 or m5 branes, as has be reviewed by j. gomis
in this school, and i refer the reader to [13, 14].

4.5 super-anti-de sitter algebras

remember that in the bosonic case, the poincare algebra is not a simple
algebra, but a contraction r   of the simple (anti) de sitter algebra
(2.2). the same will apply for the corresponding superalgebras. but in this
section we will rst go step by step to construct a super anti-de sitter algebra.
due to the last commutator of (2.2), we nd that we need a modica-
tion with respect to the super-poincare algebra to satisfy the jacobi identity
[p, p, q], see (4.5). indeed, it can not be satised anymore with [p, q] = 0.

36

for covariance (or consistency with lorentz transformations, i.e. [m, p, q]
jacobi), we should have (at least for n = 1)

[p, q] = xq ,

(4.32)

where x is an arbitrary number. but taking the complex conjugate and using
(3.22) and (3.19) we obtain

continuing with the [p, p, q] jacobi identity, we get (using (2.2))

x = ()tx .

x2 =

1

16 r2 .

(4.33)

(4.34)

specifying to t = 1, we thus nd that for  = 1, which is e.g. the case in
d = 11 and d = 4 if there are majorana spinors, x should be real. thus r2 is
positive, and this implies, see the discussion following (2.2), that we can only
have the anti-de sitter algebra, rather than de sitter. indeed, the de sitter
algebra would require r2 < 0, which is not consistent with (4.34) and real x.
for n = 1 in d = 4 or d = 11 this thus proves that one should consider anti-
de sitter, rather than de sitter algebras. for extended supersymmetry, one
could have introduced an antisymmetric matrix in the ij indices in (4.32),
and my arguments for anti-de sitter are thus not complete. for d = 10 with
n = 1 chiral supersymmetry one can not have either de sitter nor anti-de
sitter, as (4.32) is not consistent with the chirality projection.

continuing in this way with jacobi identities [6], we obtain the following

result for d = 4, n = 1:

{ql, qr} = (cid:16)c1(cid:17)
4 q

[p, q] = xq
[m, q] =  1

p + 2x(cid:16)c1(cid:17)

m

[m, m] = [m]  [m]
[p, m] = [p]

[p, p] = 8 x2 m ,

(4.35)

while in d = 11 we obtain

{q, q} = (cid:16)c1(cid:17)

p + 2x(cid:16)c1(cid:17)

with the other rules of (4.35) unchanged. remark that we need now also the
5-index central charge generator in order to be able to close the algebra.
however, it is even less central than before, because this generator now also
has a non-zero commutator with q. the z 2 of (4.31) has been identied
here with the lorentz transformations.

in fact, the d = 11 super ads algebra is not of the hls form. its bosonic
algebra is not ads  g. here it is sp(32). indeed the generators of p, m
and z 5 constitute

1! + 11

(4.37)

(4.38)

to see this algebra explicitly. the full superalgebra is osp(1|32), but for that
we should rst give an introduction to superalgebras. then we will be able
to classify also the super ads algebras in other dimensions.

4.6 superalgebras

lie superalgebras have been classied in [15]. i do not have the time to go
through the full classication mechanism of course, but will consider the most
important superalgebras, the simple lie superalgebras, which have no non-
trivial invariant subalgebra. however, one should know that in superalgebras
there are more subtle issues, as e.g. not any semi-simple superalgebra is the
direct sum of simple superalgebras. a good review is [16]. the fermionic
generators of such superalgebras are in representations of the bosonic part.
if that dening representation of the bosonic algebra in the fermionic gener-
ators is completely reducible, the algebra is said to be of classical type. the
others are cartan type superalgebras w (n), s(n), s(n) and h(n), which
we will further neglect. for further reference, i give the list of the real forms

38

of superalgebras of classical type. but, for xing my notations on algebras,
it might be useful rst to recapitulate a similar list for the bosonic algebras.
that is done in table 4. the conventions which i use for groups is that

table 4: real forms of simple bosonic lie algebras. for the exceptional
algebras, i do not repeat the obvious line that the compact form itself is one
of the real forms. the second number in the notation for these real forms is
the number of non-compact  number of compact generators.

s(n) is s(n, ir). further, su (2n) = s(n, ih) and so(2n) = o(n, ih).
note that in these bosonic algebras there are the following isomorphisms,

39

some of which will be important later11

(4.39)

the similar table for lie superalgebras of classical type, and their real
forms [17] is given in table 5. in this table, dening representation gives
the fermionic generators as a representation of the bosonic subalgebra. the
number of generators gives the numbers of (bosonic,fermionic) generators
in the superalgebra. i mention rst the algebra as an algebra over c, and
then give dierent real forms of these algebras. with this information, you
can reconstruct all properties of these algebras, up to a few exceptions. the
names which i use for the real forms is for some algebras dierent from
those in the mathematical literature [17], and chosen such that it is most
suggestive of its bosonic content. there are isomorphisms as su(2|1) =
osp(2|2, 0), and su(1, 1|1) = s(2|1) = osp(2|2). in the algebra d(2, 1, )
the three s(2) factors of the bosonic group in the anticommutator of the
fermionic generators appear with relative weights 1,  and 1  . the real

4.7 superconformal algebras

in this section i review the classication of superconformal algebras of a
standard type, to be explained soon. at the same time, however, also the ads

these isomorphism, but it are rather the covering groups of the orthogonal groups which
are mentioned at the right hand sides.

superalgebras of the similar type will be classied, due to the isomorphism
(2.17).

in supersymmetric theories, the conformal symmetry implies the presence
of a second supersymmetry s, usually denoted as special supersymmetry.
indeed, the commutator of the special conformal transformations, and the
ordinary supersymmetry q implies this s due to [k, q] = s.

the anticommutator {q, s} generates also an extra bosonic algebra (some-
times called r symmetry). the whole superalgebra can be represented in a
supermatrix, as e.g. (symbolically)

(cid:18) so(d, 2) q + s
q  s

r (cid:19) .

(4.40)

we can consider such superalgebras in general. that is what nahm [18] did
in his classication. the requirements for a superconformal algebra in d or
a super-ads algebra in d + 1 are:

1. so(d, 2) should appear as a factored subgroup of the bosonic part of
the superalgebra. for nahm, this requirement was motivated by the
colemanmandula theorem, but one can demand it also in order that
the bosonic algebra is the isometry algebra of a space which has the
ads space as a factor.

2. fermionic generators should sit in a spinorial representation of that

group.

to nd the list of superconformal algebras, one has to consider the iso-
morphisms of groups so(d, 2) which are in (4.39). then the analysis is
straightforward, and the result are algebras with maximal d = 612. the re-
sult13 is given in table 6, except for d = 2. for d = 2 the nite bosonic
ads or conformal algebra is so(2, 2)  so(2, 1)  so(2, 1), i.e. the sum
of two d = 1 algebras. the super-ads or superconformal algebra is then
the sum of two d = 1 algebras of table 6. notice that these are the nite
12note the particular case of d = 6, where we use the notation osp(8|n ) for the
superconformal algebra. often, including previous articles of ourselves, it was written
as osp(6, 2|4), not paying attention to the existing real forms.
in fact, in the series
osp(m  p, p|2n) the algebra sp(2n) is non-compact. thus, a compact r-symmetry
group, u sp(2n), is not possible in that series. the possibility of a compact r-symmetry
exists due to the isomorphism so(8) = so(6, 2), such that one can use the next line of
table 5. this thus works only for the signature (6,2).

13we mention the superalgebra with compact r-symmetry group.

part of innite dimensional superconformal algebras in 2 dimensions. for a
classication of the innite superconformal algebras, see [19]. one may also
relax the condition that the bosonic algebra contains the algebra so(d, 2) as
a factored subgroup of the whole bosonic algebra, and suce with having it
as some subgroup. then the other bosonic symmetries are not necessarily
scalars and the colemanmandula theorem is violated. however, this may
still be relevant where branes are present and has been used e.g. in [6] to
propose the osp(1|32) as super ads11 or conf10. in that case one has (4.31)
this algebra is now known as the m-theory algebra [14].

to recognize it as osp(1|32), one can write it as

{q, q} = m ,
[m, m] = c(m) + c(m) .

[m, q] = q(c)

(4.41)

exercise: obtain the commutators in (4.36) and the lorentz algebra from
this general rule, dening rst m as the right hand side of the anticommu-
tator of the supersymmetries.
in this way it is clear how all the bosonic generators form sp(32) where the
antisymmetric metric in that algebra is c.
these superconformal algebras are used in ads/cft correspondence, or
other applications in m-theory. i have been rst interested in them for the
construction of general matter couplings in super-poincare theories. this
goes along the lines explained at the end of section 2.5. for reviews on this
method in 4 dimensions, see [20, 2]. for 6 dimensions it has be applied for
(1,0) supersymmetry in [21, 3] and for (2,0) supersymmetry in [22].

acknowledgments.

i am grateful to the organizers of the school in calimanesti, especially to
radu constantinescu, for this very nice experience. the lectures already cir-
culated for some time in preliminary form, and have been improved thanks to
useful remarks of pieter-jan de smet, joeri kenes, and mauricio werneck de
oliveira. furthermore, i thank eric bergshoe, piet claus, joaquim gomis,
renata kallosh and walter troost for useful discussions. this work was sup-
ported in part by the european commission tmr programme erbfmrx-
ct96-0045.

a conventions

i use the metric signature ( + . . . +). if you prefer the opposite, insert a
minus sign for every upper index which you see, or for an explicit metric ab
or g. the gamma matrices a should then be multiplied by an i to have
this change of signature.

the curved indices are denoted by , , . . . = 0, . . . , d  1 and the at
(anti)symmetrization is done with weight one: a[ab] =

ones by a, b, ....

the anticommuting levicivita tensor is taken to be

12...d = ()t ,

where t is the number of timelike directions.
if we use the index value 0
for minkowski space, then 01...(d1) = 1. the contraction identity for these
tensors is (p + n = d)

exercises.

1. show that the tensors in (a.3) are indeed constants, i.e. that arbitrary
variations of the vierbein cancel in the full expression. you will have
to use the so-called schouten identities, which means that antisym-
metrizing in more indices than the range of the indices, gives zero.

2. if one denes in even dimensions d = 2n the dual of an n-tensor as

fa1...an = (i)d/2+t 1

check that
