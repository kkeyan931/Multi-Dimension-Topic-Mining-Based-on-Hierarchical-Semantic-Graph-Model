abstract

the niteness requirement for euclidean einstein gravity is shown
to be so stringent that only the at metric is allowed. we examine
counterterms in 4d and 6d ricci-at manifolds from general invari-

1 introduction

in a recent note by one of us[1] it was shown, by using an old result of
lichnerowicz, that the only positive denite 4-metrics for which the two loop
counter-terms of pure einstein gravity vanish are at. this is in contrast with
lorentzian 4-metrics, some of which may have all counterterms vanishing
without being at.

in fact in four dimensions, given the vanishing of the ricci tensor, the
one loop counter-term is the local integrand in the gauss-bonnet expression
for the euler number and is proportional to the square of the riemann cur-
vature tensor. thus, as long as the metric is positive denite, already at one
loop, the counter-term can only vanish if the metric is at. for a lorentzian
pp-wave metric however the square of the riemann tensor necessarily van-
ishes. note that although the integrand is locally a total derivative it is not
the divergence of a covariant vector eld and thus it cannot be disregarded
as a counterterm. it denitely contributes around non-trivial backgrounds.
however, in view of its topological nature, one might imagine absorbing this
divergence by renormalizing a topological coupling constant. the new result
at two loops then tells us that even disregarding the one loop divergence there
are no non-at two-loop nite metrics in pure gravity for which the countert-
erm vanishes. in this paper we shall discuss the situation in six dimensions
at one-loop.

by contrast with the case of four dimensions, the one loop counter-term
is not purely topological, although it contains a contribution proportional
to the the local integrand of the gauss-bonnet term, there are extra terms.
another dierence is that the divergence identity of lichnerowicz comes in
at one loop rather than two loops as it does in four dimensions. our nal
result is nevertheless similar to that in four dimensions: the extra terms can
only vanish in a at background. however, as we shall see, this does not
seem to preclude a possible cancellation of the extra terms against the euler
number. we will examine the exceptional case separately.

2 4 dimensional euclidean gravity

let us rst recall the case of four dimensional pure einstein gravity with a
positive denite (euclidean) metric [1]. the action is

1


l =

gr ,

(1)

where  and r are the gravitational constant and the riemann scalar curva-
ture. their physical dimensions are [] = {m(ass)}2 and [r] = m2 respec-
tively. in perturbative quantum gravity, the original lagrangian should be
shifted as l + l1-loop + l2-loop +   , in order to subtract ultraviolet
divergences. the most general 1-loop counter lagrangian, not neglecting the
total derivative terms 1 , may be written as

l1-loop = a2r + b1r2 + b2rabrab + b3rabcdrabcd

.

(2)

the 4 terms above are locally independent and the complete list of general
invariants with the dimension of m4.
2 here we introduce a convenient
graphical representation[6] for these invariants to get a better perspective,
especially for the extension to the higher orders and to the higher dimension.

2r =

, r2 =

rabrab =

, rabcdrabcd =

,

.

(3)

among the 4 invariants above, two special combinations are well known: the
euler term (e) and the conformal invariant (c).

conformal invariant c =

euler term e = r2  4rabrab + rabcdrabcd
r2  2rabrab + rabcdrabcd

,

.

(4)

1 in many conventional treatments of counterterms, total derivatives and the euler
term are ignored[2]. here we keep them in order to know how the requirement of niteness
constrains the global and asymptotic behavior of the spacetime manifold.

2 if we identify 1-loop counterterm with the trace anomaly, it looks that the possible
terms reduce to the following 3 [3, 4, 5] : e(euler term),c(conformal invariant) and
2r(trivial term).

3

now we consider ricci at (rf) manifolds:

rab = 0.

therefore the quantities above reduce to

l1-loop|rf = b3

, e|rf = c|rf =

(5)

.

(6)

thus the requirement of ricci at (on-shell) niteness leads to (assuming
b3 6= 0)

z g

= z grabcdrabcd = 0

.

this means, in the euclidean metric, that the geometry is locally at:

rabcd = 0

.

(7)

(8)

consequently this says e and c locally vanish. especially the euler number

vanishes: r ge|rf = 0.

one might wonder whether this result is an accidental due to the simplic-
ity of the 1-loop terms or the special nature of the 4 dimensions one 1-loop
counterterm, which is proportional to the euler term for a ricci at man-
ifold. therefore let us examine the 2-loop level. the most general form of
the 2-loop counterterm, including total derivatives, can be expressed as some
linear combination of the following 15 terms.

press m 6-invariants and are dened in [7] with their graphs. (see eq.(24),eq.(43)
and figs.44-48 of this reference). l2-loop(9) reduces to, on a ricci at

manifold,

nerowicz identity[8] on a 4 dim ricci at manifold:

before imposing 2-loop niteness, we rewrite a1 in (10) using the lich-

(see appendix.) finally (10) is written as

we consider a regular manifold on which the total integral of total deriva-
tives vanish. then the requirement of 2-loop niteness reduces to, assuming
 w

3 + y3  z3 6= 0,

z go3 = z g(erabcd)2 = 0 .

this means, in the euclidean metric,

using this result, we obtain

erabcd = 0 .

which means again (8).

we claim that to require niteness is to require a locally at metric (8)
in 4 dim euclidean pure einstein gravity. we have shown this for 1-loop
and 2-loop orders. it would be quite interesting if one could prove the same
result for higher orders. the key point for such an extension would be a
generalization of the lichnerowicz identity to general invariants with higher
dimensions as shown in fig.1.

3 6 dimensional euclidean gravity

besides the higher loop order situation, the higher dimensional extension is
also interesting. let us consider 6 dim pure einstein gravity with a euclidean
metric.

the 17 terms above are dened in eq.(24) of ref.[7]. note that above expres-
sion slightly diers from (9) in that p6 and b1 appear here. 4 on a ricci

invariants in d-dim space, which are special to the space dimension d. in eq.(9), where
n = 6 and d = 4, p6 and b1 do not appear to be due to the special relations.

(23)

(cf.(6)). using the following three relations:
i) the lichnerowicz identity[8] on a six dimensional ricci at manifold is,

2(

) = 2a1 + 8b1 + 2o3

,

(24)

(see appendix,cf (13));
ii) the euler term relation in (23); and
iii) the relation (12),
(21) can be rewritten as

(25)

(cf. (14)). now we require 1-loop niteness:

z d6xgl

1-loop

6

|rf = 0 .

(26)

we shall assume that the boundary terms of genuinely covariant divergence
identities vanish. however even if we do so, we cannot assume in general
that the integral of the gauss-bonnet integrand vanishes. we notice here a
delicate thing, an analogous one appeared in 1-loop of 4 dim gravity, appears.

7

in order to clearly look at the things which are independent of the euler
number contribution, we treat the following two cases separately.

case a :

case b :

z d6xge|rf = 0 ,
z d6xge|rf 6= 0 .

(27)

(28)

5

case a

in this case, with the assumption:  1

6 (2w1 + w2) + y3  z3 6= 0, the 1-
loop niteness requirement (26) again reduces to (15). because the results
of (16-18) hold true for 6 dim, we conclude that the requirement of (1-loop)
niteness again means (8) that the metric is locally at.

if our manifold is compact then (27) implies that the euler characteristic
vanishes. in four dimensions the ricci-at condition would then force the
metric to be at. in six dimensions, as far as we are aware, closed ricci at,
non-at manifolds may have vanishing euler number.
if the six-manifold
is not closed then there will in general be boundary contributions to the
gauss-bonnet formula and (27) does not necessarilly imply the vanishing of
the euler number.

case b

in case b, the euler number contribution cancels against the remaining

contribution.

.(29)

first we should note that the two coecients, in front of above two terms, are
determined by the ultraviolet structure of the quantum gravity. while the

integral of the the gauss-bonnet term, r d6xge|rf , is determined by the
topology of the background space manifold. therefore, assuming 4w1 w2 6=
5 in 4 dim case(see section 2), the vanishing of the euler number is deduced from the
1-loop niteness. vanishing of the volume integral of the boundary terms is required at
2-loop level.

6 (2w1+w2)+y3z3 6= 0, the above equation requires the volume integral
of a local quantity, r d6xgo3, is determined only by the local quantum
if such a
structure and the global structure of the background manifold.
metric consistently exists, it must be a very special one ( which describes
something like a boundary theory ).

4 discussion and conclusion

the coecients of the counterterms in 6 dim pure einstein gravity (with
lorentzian metric) was obtained by p.van nieuwenhuizen[9] and by
r. critchley[10]. they focused on a1 ( not on o3 as in the present anal-
ysis). the ricci at counter lagragian (25) can also be expressed as

they obtained the coecient in front of a1 as
4315120 . note that this co-
ecient is proportional to the previous one in front of o3 and it shows the
non-zero assumption taken there holds true. in their derivation, in eect, the
lichnerowicz identity was used. in the eq.(63) of ref.[10], the top equation
corresponds to the identity (24), the middle one to (12), and the bottom to
the rst equation of (23). (x and y, in their notation, correspond to a1
and b1 respectively.)
the approach to the niteness of the quatum gravity taken in [1] and the
present paper should be distinguished from the ordinary one taken so far.
ordinarily, beginning from the t hooft and veltmans analysis[2], the focus
is mainly on the cancellation between coecients of counterterms, where care
is not taken so much for the background (metric) eld except that it satis-
es the eld equation. in the ordinary approach, the supergravity theories
realize the niteness requirement to some extent. the 1-loop cancellation in
some theories is reviewed in [11] from the view of the weyl anomaly. infor-
mation about the counter-terms for scalars, spinors and vectors is given in
[12]. it seems that the full counter-terms for six-dimensional supergravity
theories have not yet been written down. the present approach, by contrast,
focuses on the background metric eld itself rather than on the coecients.

9

instead of seeking the cancellation among coecients, the constraints on the
metric eld which are induced from the niteness requirement are examined.
the standpoint is that the quantum structure can constrain the eective
background eld. our observation is that the niteness requirement in the
present approach is so stringent, in euclidean case, that the at space is only
allowed (except a special case).
