we calculate a renormalized hamiltonian for pure-glue qcd and diagonalize it. the renor-

malization procedure is designed to produce a hamiltonian that will yield physical states that

rapidly converge in an expansion in free-particle fock-space sectors. to make this possible,

we use light-front eld theory to isolate vacuum eects, and we place a smooth cuto on the

hamiltonian to force its free-state matrix elements to quickly decrease as the dierence of

the free masses of the states increases. the cuto violates a number of physical principles of

light-front pure-glue qcd, including lorentz covariance and gauge covariance. this means

that the operators in the hamiltonian are not required to respect these physical principles.

however, by requiring the hamiltonian to produce cuto-independent physical quantities and

by requiring it to respect the unviolated physical principles of pure-glue qcd, we are able to

derive recursion relations that dene the hamiltonian to all orders in perturbation theory in

terms of the running coupling. we approximate all physical states as two-gluon states (thus

they are relatively simple single-glueball states), and use our recursion relations to calculate

to second order the part of the hamiltonian that is required to compute the spectrum. we

diagonalize the hamiltonian using basis-function expansions for the gluons color, spin, and

momentum degrees of freedom. we examine the sensitivity of our results to the cuto and

use them to analyze the nonperturbative scale dependence of the coupling. we investigate

the eect of the dynamical rotational symmetry of light-front eld theory on the rotational

degeneracies of the spectrum and compare the spectrum to recent lattice results. finally, we

examine our wave functions and analyze the various sources of error in our calculation.

introduction

a solution to a quantum eld theory that is close to our physical intuition is possible if we can develop

a formalism in which the physical states of the theory rapidly converge in an expansion in free-particle

fock-space sectors (free sectors). such an expansion is unlikely to be possible in an equal-time approach

to many of the more interesting theories, such as qcd. this is because in equal-time approaches to these

theories, the physical states must be built on top of a complicated vacuum unless the volume of space

is severely limited. for this reason, we work in light-front eld theory (lfft). in lfft, it is possible

to force the vacuum to be empty by removing from the theory all particles that have zero longitudinal
momentum1. any physical eects of these particles must be incorporated into the operators of the theory
in order to obtain correct physical quantities.

in lfft, the hamiltonian is trivially related to the invariant-mass operator2 (imo), and it is more
natural to work with the imo because it is manifestly boost-invariant. if the imo satises three conditions

in the basis of free-particle fock-space states (free states), then its eigenstates will rapidly converge in

an expansion in free sectors. first, the diagonal matrix elements of the imo must be dominated by the

free part of the imo. second, the o-diagonal matrix elements of the imo must quickly decrease as the

dierence of the free masses of the states increases. if the imo satises these rst two conditions, then

each of its eigenstates will be dominated by free-state components with free masses that are close to

the mass of the eigenstate. the third condition on the imo is that the free mass of a free state must

quickly increase as the number of particles in the state increases. if the imo satises all three conditions,

then the number of particles in a free-state component that dominates an eigenstate will be limited from
above. this means that the imos eigenstates will rapidly converge in an expansion in free sectors3.

to satisfy the rst condition on the imo, we assume that we can derive the imo in perturbation

theory. if this is true, then the couplings are small and the diagonal matrix elements of the imo are

dominated by the free part of the imo. to satisfy the second condition, we place a smooth cuto on the

imo to force its matrix elements to quickly decrease as the dierence of the free masses of the states

increases. once we have removed the particles with zero longitudinal momentum from the theory, it is

1this is because there are no negative longitudinal momenta and momentum conservation requires the three-momenta

of the constituents of the vacuum to sum to zero.

2the invariant-mass operator is given by the square of the momentum operator: p p = m2. see appendix a for

more details.

3there are three subtleties here. the rst subtlety is that the rst and third conditions on the imo will not be satised
for those free states in which many of the particles have negligible center-of-mass transverse momentum and little or

no mass. however, the contributions of these free states to the physical states in which we are interested are typically

suppressed. for example, in qcd these free states have very large widths in transverse position space and are thus highly

suppressed by connement. in qed, the particles with negligible center-of-mass transverse momentum and no mass are

long-transverse-wavelength photons. these photons decouple from the physical states in which we are typically interested,

e.g. charge-singlet states like hydrogen and positronium. thus the contributions to these physical states from the free states

containing these photons are suppressed.

the second subtlety is that exactly how quickly the imos o-diagonal matrix elements must decrease and the free mass

of a free state must increase are not known. we assume that the rates that we are able to achieve are sucient. this can

be veried by diagonalizing the imo and examining the rate of convergence of the free-sector expansion of its eigenstates.

the third subtlety is that the coecients of the expansion for highly excited eigenstates may grow for a number of free

sectors and then peak before diminishing and becoming rapidly convergent.

2

reasonable to expect that the third and nal condition on the imo will be satised automatically. this is

because the free-particle dispersion relation of lfft should force the free mass of a free state to quickly

increase as the number of particles in the state increases (see appendix a of ref. [1]).

by suppressing the matrix elements of the imo that have large changes in free mass, the cuto

regulates the ultraviolet divergences of the theory. unfortunately, it also violates a number of physical

principles of lfft, including lorentz covariance and gauge covariance. this means that the operators

in the imo are not required to respect these physical principles, and renormalization is not simply a

matter of adjusting a few canonical parameters. the simplest way to systematically determine the imo

in this case is in perturbation theory. in order for a perturbative computation of the imo to be strictly
valid, the theory must be asymptotically free4. if this is the case, then by requiring the imo to produce
cuto-independent physical quantities and by requiring it to respect the unviolated physical principles of
the theory5, we can derive recursion relations that dene the imo to all orders in perturbation theory in
terms of the fundamental parameters of the eld theory. if our cuto is large enough, then the couplings

will be small and the perturbative approximation to the imo may work well.

the physical principles that we use to determine the imo form a subset of the full set of physical

principles of light-front eld theory. this raises the question of how the remaining principles, which are

violated by our cuto, are restored in physical quantities. since the imo is uniquely determined by the

principles that we use, the remaining principles must be automatically respected by physical quantities

derived from our imo, at least perturbatively. if they are not, then they contradict the principles that

we use and no consistent theory can be built upon the complete set of principles. the reason that this

process is possible is that there are redundancies among the various physical principles.

it is possible to compute operators other than the imo in our approach. although we compute op-

erators perturbatively, we can use these operators to compute nonperturbative quantities. for example,

the spectrum can be computed by diagonalizing the imo (see section 6). however, there are drawbacks

to computing operators perturbatively. it is possible that there are intrinsically nonperturbative eects

in the theory that require nonperturbative renormalization. any such eects are neglected in this ap-

proach. another problem is that perturbative renormalization makes nonperturbative physical quantities

somewhat cuto-dependent.

in general, eld theories have an innite number of degrees of freedom. however, since our imo

will cause the physical states of the theory to rapidly converge in an expansion in free sectors, we can

truncate this expansion. this means that approximate computations of physical quantities will require

only a nite number of nite-body matrix elements of operators. in addition, since we assume that we can

compute these matrix elements perturbatively, we do not implement particle creation and annihilation

nonperturbatively in these calculations. this allows us to always work with a nite number of degrees of

freedom.

when we perturbatively calculate matrix elements of operators, we do not truncate the space of

4our method may work even if the theory is not asymptotically free. for example, it works in qed because the scale

at which the electron charge is large is astronomical.

5some of the physical principles, such as cluster decomposition, are violated in a very specic manner and can still be
used to restrict the form of the imo. however, the restriction in this situation is always weaker than it would have been

had there been no violation of the principle.

3

intermediate states that can appear; so our approach does not use a tamm-danco truncation6 [2, 3, 4].
we also do not completely eliminate any interactions, such as those that change particle number. these

strengths of our approach allow us to better describe physical theories. however, the truncation of the free-

sector expansion of physical states has drawbacks that are similar to those of perturbative renormalization.

it neglects any physical eects that require an innite number of particles and contributes to the cuto

dependence of nonperturbative physical quantities.

the accuracy of our results and the strength of the cuto dependence of our nonperturbative physical

quantities are determined by the order in perturbation theory to which we calculate the operators of the

theory and the number of free sectors that we keep in the expansion of physical states. if we use a cuto

that is too small, then the couplings of the theory will be large, and it will be necessary for us to keep

many terms in the expansion of the operators. if we use a cuto that is too large, then the free-sector

expansion of the physical states will converge slowly, and it will be necessary for us to keep many sectors

in the states. we assume that if the order of perturbation theory and the number of free sectors are

manageable, then there is a range of cuto values for which the approximations work well and physical

quantities are relatively accurate and cuto-independent.

as we mentioned, we remove from the theory all particles with zero longitudinal momentum. we

should replace their physical eects with interactions. however, due to the limitations of our method, we

can reproduce only those eects of these particles that can be derived with perturbative renormalization

and require only a small number of particles.

there are a number of approaches that are similar to ours [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and some of these

methods have been used to calculate the physical states of qcd [12, 13]. these calculations are based

on nonrelativistic approximations and use sharp step-function cutos. nonrelativistic approximations

drastically simplify the diagonalization of the imo, but are insucient for states containing light quarks

or gluons. sharp cutos prevent the complete cancellation of the infrared divergences that appear in
light-front gauge theories7.

our approach is completely relativistic and uses smooth cutos to ensure the complete cancellation

of the light-front infrared divergences. it is largely based on the renormalization methods of perry [14],

methods of wegner [17]. in ref.

perry and wilson [15], wilson [16], and g lazek and wilson [5], as well as the hamiltonian-diagonalization
[1], we developed and tested our method in massless 3 theory in six
dimensions. in ref. [18], kylin, allen, and perry extended this method to include particle masses. in this

paper, we extend our method to pure-glue qcd. this theory is simpler than full qcd due to the reduced

number of vertices and the absence of quark masses. for this application, we derive the recursion relations

that determine the imo to all orders in perturbation theory in the running coupling. we approximate all

physical states as two-gluon states and use the recursion relations to compute to second order the part of

the imo that is required to compute the spectrum. we diagonalize the imo in a basis-state expansion

and analyze the results.

6the only degrees of freedom that we remove from the full theory are the particles with zero longitudinal momentum.
we should be able to replace the physical eects of these particles with interactions without compromising the validity of

the theory. this is because these particles are vacuum eects or have innite kinetic energies (or both), and thus are not

observable in the laboratory as particles.

7these appear due to the exchange of massless gauge particles with arbitrarily small longitudinal momentum.

in the remainder of the introduction, we outline the rest of the paper. appendix a contains our

conventions for light-front pure-glue qcd; so the reader may wish to examine it rst. in section 2 we

present our method for computing the free-state matrix elements of the imo. after dening the action

of our cuto, we place a number of restrictions on the imo. first we force the imo at a given cuto

to be unitarily equivalent to itself at a higher cuto. this implies that the imo is unitarily equivalent

to itself at an innite cuto, and will therefore yield cuto-independent physical quantities. from the

statement of unitary equivalence, we develop a perturbative series that relates the interactions at two

dierent cutos. we then proceed to use physical principles to restrict the form of the imo. we require

it to conserve momentum and to be invariant under boosts and rotations about the 3-axis. although

our cuto violates exact transverse locality, we are able to require the imo to respect an approximate

transverse locality.

in practice this means that the imos matrix elements are analytic functions of

transverse momenta. the cuto also violates cluster decomposition, but we show that the implications

of this violation are simple enough that we can still use this principle to restrict the form of the imo.

in order to represent pure-glue qcd, the imo must become the free imo in the noninteracting limit,

and it must be a function only of the cuto and the coupling. the nal physical restriction on the imo is

that it must reproduce the perturbative scattering amplitudes of pure-glue qcd. this restriction species

the form of the rst-order interaction and part of the second-order interaction.

we use the restrictions from physical principles and the perturbative series that relates the interactions

at two dierent cutos to derive the recursion relations that determine the imo. a crucial step in this

process is the removal of the coupling from the perturbative series. this allows us to separate the cuto

dependences of the operators in the interaction from the cuto dependences of their couplings. most of

the details of this derivation are relegated to appendix b.

in section 3 we dene a basis for the expansion of physical states. we construct the physical states

to be simultaneous eigenstates of the imo, the three-momentum operator, and the part of the generator

of rotations about the 3-axis that generates rotations of the internal degrees of freedom of states (as

opposed to their centers of mass). we approximate all physical states as two-gluon states, which means

that they are relatively simple single-glueball states. we analytically calculate the color parts of the

states by requiring the states to be color singlets, and then we expand the states spin and momentum

degrees of freedom in a complete set of orthonormal basis functions. we conclude section 3 by deriving

the eigenvalue equation for the imo in our basis.

in section 4 we use the recursion relations for the imo to compute its two-gluon to two-gluon matrix

element to second order in the running coupling. this is the only free-state matrix element that we need

to solve the eigenvalue equation.

in section 5 we compute the matrix elements of the imo in the basis that we have dened, in terms

of integrals that must be evaluated numerically. to avoid roundo error, we evaluate the integrals for the

kinetic energy and the two-point interaction (the self-energy) by writing them as sums of gamma functions.

the remaining integrals are ve-dimensional, and we compute them with monte carlo methods. however,

before we can do this, it is necessary for us to make manifest the cancellation of the infrared divergences

from exchanged gluons with innitesimal longitudinal momentum. this is nontrivial, and even after

the divergences are gone, we must manipulate the integrals quite a bit to get them into a form that is

5

amenable to monte carlo integration. we present some of these details and other technical issues in

appendix c.

in section 6 we derive our results and analyze the sources of error in the calculation. we begin by

discussing how we assign quantum numbers to our numerical results for glueball states and proceed with

a discussion of the procedure that we use to compute these results. we derive the nonperturbative cuto

dependence of the coupling and discuss the cuto dependence of our glueball masses. we use this analysis

to choose the value of the cuto that minimizes our errors. we then present the spectrum that we nd

with this optimal cuto and compare it to recent lattice results. the last results that we present are the

probability densities for our ve lightest glueballs. we conclude section 6 by discussing the sources of

error in our calculation and estimating the sizes of these errors.

finally, in section 7 we conclude with a summary and a discussion of the direction of future work.

2 the method for computing free-state matrix elements of

the invariant-mass operator

this section summarizes the extension of the results of sections 2-4 and appendix d of ref. [1] to the

case of pure-glue qcd.

2.1 the cuto

our goal is to derive recursion relations that uniquely determine the imo to all orders in perturbation

theory in the running coupling. the imo is a function of the cuto, and can be split into the canonical

free imo and an interaction (see appendix a for our light-front pure-glue qcd conventions):

the cuto is implemented on the matrix elements of the imo:

m2() = m2

free + m2

int().

(1)

(2)

hf|m2()|ii = hf|m2

free |ii + hf|m2

= m 2

f hf|i i + e

f and m 2

where |fi and |ii are eigenstates of the free imo with eigenvalues m 2
of these eigenvalues:

i , and f i is the dierence

f i = m 2

f  m 2
i .

(3)

v () is the interaction with the gaussian cuto factor removed, and we refer to it as the reduced

interaction. to determine the imo, we must determine the reduced interaction.

we will see that hf| v ()|ii does not grow exponentially as 2

(2) forces the o-diagonal matrix elements of the imo to rapidly diminish as 2
the second of our three conditions on the imo and regulates it.

f i gets large; so the exponential in eq.
f i grows. this satises

6

2.2 the restriction to produce cuto-independent physical quantities

our cuto violates a number of physical principles of lfft, including lorentz covariance and gauge
covariance8. this means that the operators in the imo are not required to respect these physical
principles. in addition, since there is no locality in the longitudinal direction in hamiltonian lfft9,
these operators can contain arbitrary functions of longitudinal momenta. to uniquely determine the

imo in this case, we have to place some restrictions on it. the rst restriction is that it must produce
cuto-independent physical quantities. to enforce this, we require m2() to satisfy

m2() = u (, ) m2() u (, ),

where u is a unitary transformation that changes the imos cuto and

 <  < 2.

(4)

(5)

we have placed an upper limit on  because eq. (4) is perturbatively valid only if  is not too much
larger than  [19]. note that we are considering m2() to be a function of its argument; i.e. m2()
has the same functional dependence on  that m2() has on . in ref.
[1], we proved that eq. (4)
forces m2() to produce cuto-independent physical quantities.

the unitary transformation that we use is designed to alter the cuto implemented in eq. (2), and

is a simplied version of a transformation introduced by wegner [17], modied for implementation with

the imo. it is uniquely dened by a linear rst-order dierential equation:

with one boundary condition:

du (, )
d(4)

= t ()u (, ),

u (, ) = 1.

u (, ) is unitary as long as t () is anti-hermitian and linear [1]. we dene

which is anti-hermitian and linear.

t () =(cid:2)m2

free,m2()(cid:3) ,

(6)

(7)

(8)

to solve for m2() perturbatively, we need to turn eq. (4) into a perturbative restriction on the
reduced interaction, v (). we outlined how to do this in ref. [1], and here we simply state the results

that we need. the perturbative version of eq. (4) in terms of the reduced interaction is

v ()  v () = v,

(9)

where v is the change to the reduced interaction and is a function of both  and :

8our regulator breaks these symmetries because the mass of a free state is neither gauge-invariant nor rotationally

invariant (except for rotations about the 3-axis).

9that there is no longitudinal locality in hamiltonian lfft is evident from the fact that the longitudinal momentum

of a free particle appears in the denominator of its dispersion relation, (~p 2

 + m2)/p+.

2.3 restrictions from physical principles

eq. (9) is the rst restriction on the imo. to uniquely determine the imo, we need to place additional

restrictions on it, and we do this using the physical principles of the theory that are not violated by the

cuto. (see footnote 5.)

2.3.1 symmetry principles

any lfft should exhibit manifest momentum conservation, boost covariance, and covariance under

rotations about the 3-axis. our cuto does not violate any of these principles; so we restrict the imo to

conserve momentum and to be invariant under boosts and rotations about the 3-axis.

2.3.2 transverse locality

ideally, the imo should be local in the transverse directions, and thus each of its matrix elements

should be expressible as a nite series of powers of transverse momenta with expansion coecients

8

that are functions of longitudinal momenta. in our case, the cuto suppresses interactions that have

large transverse-momentum transfers and replaces them with interactions that have smaller transverse-

momentum transfers. this is equivalent to suppressing interactions that occur over small transverse

separations and replacing them with interactions that occur over larger transverse separations; so we

do not expect our interactions to be perfectly transverse-local. nonetheless, we expect that interactions
in m2() should appear local relative to transverse separations larger than 1 or, equivalently, to
transverse momenta less than . this means that for transverse momenta less than  we should be
able to approximate each matrix element of m2() as a nite power series in ~p/. we enforce this by
assuming that transverse locality is violated in the weakest manner possible, i.e. that any matrix element

of the imo can be expressed as an innite series of powers of transverse momenta with an innite radius

of convergence. in other words, we assume that the matrix elements of the imo are analytic functions

of transverse momenta.

2.3.3 cluster decomposition

since the matrix elements of the imo conserve momentum, they can be written as a sum of terms, with

each term containing a unique product of momentum-conserving delta functions [20]. we require the imo

to satisfy approximate cluster decomposition [1]; i.e. when any of its matrix elements is written as an

expansion in the possible products of momentum-conserving delta functions, the coecient of any term

in the expansion is restricted as follows. (if there is more than one possible set of spectators for a given

product of momentum-conserving delta functions, then the coecient has to be broken into a distinct

part for each possible set, and these restrictions hold for each part separately.) it can depend on the

cuto, the quantum numbers of the interacting particles, and the total longitudinal momentum. it must

be proportional to a quantum-number-conserving kronecker delta for each discrete quantum number for

each spectator. it can have no other dependence on the quantum numbers of spectators, and it cannot

contain delta functions that x momenta.

the reason that the imo does not respect exact cluster decomposition and that the coecients in

the delta-function expansion can depend on the momenta of spectators (through a dependence on the

to see this, note that the change in free mass for some process is given by p +(pj p 

total longitudinal momentum) is that our cuto on free-mass dierences violates cluster decomposition.
i ), where
the pis are the momenta of the particles in the initial state, the p
js are the momenta of the particles
in the nal state, and p + is the total longitudinal momentum of each state. the minus momenta of any
spectators cancel in this dierence, but their longitudinal momenta still contribute to the overall factor
of p +.

j pi p

2.3.4 representation of the theory of interest

the preceding restrictions on m2() are valid for any lfft in more than two dimensions. in order to
represent a particular theory, we must place additional restrictions on m2().

we assume that we can compute m2() perturbatively, which means that we can expand v () in
powers of the coupling at the scale . our cuto has no eect in the noninteracting limit; so our imo

9

must reproduce free pure-glue qcd in this limit. according to eq. (2), this means that v () vanishes

in the noninteracting limit.

in pure-glue qcd, the only fundamental parameter is the coupling; so we require the imo to depend

only on it and the scale. (for an example of the application of our method to a theory with more than

one parameter, see ref. [18].) in this case, the expansion of v () takes the form

v () =

 ) reduced interaction, although

g is the correct fundamental parameter for pure-glue qcd if and only if its denition is consistent

with the canonical denition of the coupling. the canonical denition is

g = h163p+

1 (3)(p1  p2  p3) <| g2g3|v|g1>|i1

hg2g3|m2 |g1i ,

(15)

where v is the canonical interaction and <| j|v|i>| denotes a modied matrix element of v. (see appendix a
for our light-front pure-glue qcd conventions.) the denominator removes all dependence on momentum,

spin, and color in the canonical matrix element for gluon emission, and thus isolates the coupling. we

dene the coupling g by

g = (cid:26)h163p+
= (cid:26)h163p+

1 (3)(p1  p2  p3) <| g2g3|v|g1>|i1

where n = 1, 2, 3, and  is a longitudinal-momentum cuto that we dene below. momentum conservation

and boost invariance imply that the matrix element that denes the coupling can depend only on the

our denition of the coupling is consistent with the canonical denition because the conditions on

the matrix elements in eq. (16) have no eect on the right-hand side (rhs) of eq. (15) and do not force
hg2g3|m2 |g1i to vanish. according to eq. (14), the imo is coupling coherent [14, 15, 21] because the
couplings of its noncanonical operators are functions only of the fundamental parameters of the theory

and they vanish in the noninteracting limit.

we have assumed that the imo obeys approximate transverse locality, which means that we can
expand any matrix element hf| v (r)()|ii in powers of transverse momenta. each term in this expansion
is either cuto-dependent or cuto-independent. we dene v (r)
cd() to be the cuto-dependent part of
v (r)(), i.e. the part that produces the cuto-dependent terms in transverse-momentum expansions of
matrix elements of v (r)(). we dene v (r)
ci to be the cuto-independent part of v (r)(), i.e. the part
that produces the cuto-independent terms in transverse-momentum expansions of matrix elements of
v (r)(). then

v (r)() = v (r)

we believe that if m2() is to reproduce the perturbative scattering amplitudes of pure-glue qcd,
then it is necessary and sucient for the reduced interaction to satisfy the following conditions10. we

having a four-point interaction unless r is even. we require

the presence of  in these step-function cutos ensures that we will avoid divergences from exchanged

gluons (either instantaneous or real) with innitesimal longitudinal momentum. in section 5 we show
how we can take  to zero before we diagonalize m2().

10any longitudinal regulator that is consistent with the physical principles that we use to restrict the imo is sucient.

it is not necessary to use our  cuto in order to reproduce the perturbative scattering amplitudes of pure-glue qcd.

11

we have not yet proved that the above conditions on the reduced interaction are necessary and

sucient to reproduce the perturbative scattering amplitudes of pure-glue qcd. we can, however, show
in 3 theory [1] that analogous conditions are necessary and sucient to reproduce all second-order
scattering amplitudes.

2.4 the recursion relations for the invariant-mass operator

the restrictions that we have placed on the imo are sucient to uniquely determine it order-by-order in
perturbation theory. in this subsection, we present the recursion relations that dene m2() in terms of
v (1) and v (2)
ci , which we have dened above. to begin, we consider the restriction that forces the imo
to produce cuto-independent physical quantities:

v ()  v () = v.

(23)

this restriction is in terms of the reduced interaction and the change to the reduced interaction.

v is dened in eq. (10), which makes it clear that since v () can be expanded in powers of g , so

can v :

v =



xt=2

 v (t).
gt

(24)

we refer to v (t) as the o(gt
is factored out. note that v (t) is a function of  and .
now eq. (23) can be expanded in powers of g and g :

 ) change to the reduced interaction, although for convenience the coupling



xt=1

v (t)() 
gt



xt=1

 v (t)() =
gt

 v (t).
gt



xt=2

(25)

this equation is a bit tricky to use because it involves the couplings at two dierent scales. to see how
they are related, consider the matrix element of eq. (23) for g1  g2g3:

hg2g3| v ()|g1i  hg2g3| v ()|g1i = hg2g3| v |g1i .

according to the denition of the coupling, this equation implies that

g  g =(cid:26)h163p+

1 (3)(p1  p2  p3) <| g2g3|v|g1>|i1

hg2g3| v |g1i(cid:27)sn=1; cn=n

~p2=~p3; p+

(26)

. (27)

2 =p+

3 ;=0

since v (1) changes particle number by 1, inspection of eq. (10) reveals that hg2g3| v |g1i is o(g3

 ); so

this implies that

g = g + o(g3
 ).

g = g +

where the bt,ss are functions of  and , and can be calculated in terms of the css by raising eq. (29)
to the tth power.

we substitute eq.

(30) into eq. (25) and demand that it hold order-by-order in g . at o(gr

v (r)()  v (r)() = v (r) 

r1

xs=2

brs,sv (rs)(),

(31)

where v (1) = 0, and we dene any sum to be zero if its upper limit is less than its lower limit. the
cuto-independent parts of v (r)() and v (r)() cancel on the left-hand side (lhs), leaving

cd()  v (r)
v (r)

cd() = v (r) 

r1

xs=2

brs,sv (rs)().

(32)

this equation can be used to derive the desired recursion relations.

in the remainder of this section, we summarize the results of appendix b, which contains a derivation

of the recursion relations that dene the imo. appendix b is an extension of appendix d of ref. [1] to

the case of pure-glue qcd.

recall that momentum conservation implies that any matrix element hf| v ()|ii can be written as
an expansion in unique products of momentum-conserving delta functions. this means that an arbitrary

matrix element of eq. (32) can be expanded in products of delta functions and thus is equivalent to a set

of equations, one for each possible product of delta functions. given approximate transverse locality, each

of the resulting equations can be expanded in powers of transverse momenta. matching the coecients

of the powers of transverse momenta on either side of these equations allows us to rigorously derive the

following results (see appendix b for details).

first, the cuto-dependent part of the o(gr

reduced interactions by

 ) reduced interaction is given in terms of lower-order

hf| v (r)

cd()|ii ="hf| v (r) |ii 

r1

xs=2

brs,s hf| v (rs)()|ii# terms

,

(33)

where  terms means that the rhs is to be expanded in powers of transverse momenta and only the

terms in the expansion that are proportional to powers or inverse powers of  contribute. recall that
v (r) is dened by eqs. (10) and (24).

second, the cuto-independent part of v (r)() has two contributions: a four-point interaction with
no transverse-momentum dependence, and a three-point interaction that is linear in transverse momenta.
if there are no such contributions to v (r)(), then it is completely determined by eq. (33). third,
the coupling runs at odd orders; i.e. cs is zero if s is even [see eq. (29)]. fourth, there is no wave-
function renormalization at any order in perturbation theory in our approach because this would violate

the restrictions that we have placed on the imo.

the fth and nal result from appendix b is that the cuto-independent parts of the o(gr

) reduced interactions for odd r  3 are determined by the coupled integral equations11

 ) and

11it is very dicult to prove that integral equations of this type have a unique solution; so we simply assume that it is

o(gr+1



true in this case.

3 the basis for the expansion of physical states

3.1 preliminaries

in the remainder of this paper, we use the results of our renormalization procedure to compute the
physical states of pure-glue qcd and their masses. the states will be eigenstates of m2(). since our
cuto preserves translational covariance and covariance under rotations about the 3-axis, we would like

the states to also be simultaneous eigenstates of the generators of these symmetries, but this is impossible

because translations do not commute with rotations. however, a rotation about the 3-axis separates into

a part that rotates the centers of mass of states and a part that rotates states internal degrees of freedom,

and translations do commute with these internal rotations.

to be precise, we dene j3 to be the generator of rotations about the 3-axis, and j r

3 to be the part of
j3 governing gluons momenta in the center-of-mass frame and spin polarizations. m2(), p +, ~p, and
j r
3 are a set of commuting observables; so an eigenstate of m2() can be labeled by their eigenvalues.
we choose to write a physical state as (cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11), where p is the three-momentum of the state, j is the
eigenvalue of j r
n = 2 has the second-smallest mass, etc.). note that because (cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) will be determined by m2(), it
an examination of the matrix elements of m2() leads us to believe that the light-front infrared
divergences (see the discussion below) will not cancel unless the physical states are color singlets, although

3 for the state, and n labels the mass eigenvalue of the state (n = 1 has the smallest mass,

will implicitly depend on  and g.

14

we do not have a rigorous proof of this. therefore, we assume that the physical states are color singlets.

using the fock-space expansion for the identity operator (see appendix a for our light-front pure-glue

qcd conventions), we can expand a physical state in terms of the number of gluons:

(36)

(cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) = 1(cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) 

1

2!z d1d2(cid:10)g1g2(cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) |g1g2i ,

where there is no one-gluon component because there is no color-singlet gluon. we neglect contributions

to the states with more than two gluons, which is a severe approximation. this means that we are

approximating all physical states as relatively simple single-glueball states, and j is then the projection

of the glueballs spin onto the 3-axis. from now on, we refer to the approximate physical states simply

as glueball states.

any eigenstate of m2() can be written as a superposition of cross-product states:

jn

(cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) = xi

i (p )e ,
where |n,ii is the color part of the ith contribution to the state and (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

i (p )e is the momentum/spin
the free state |g1g2i is dened as a two-gluon state in which one particle has quantum numbers p1,
|g1g2i is symmetrized with respect to

s1, and c1, and the other has quantum numbers p2, s2, and c2.
particle labels. thus we can write

|n,ii (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

part.

jn

(37)

|g1g2i =

1

2h|g1; g2i + |g2; g1ii,

(38)

where the semi-colon in |g1; g2i indicates that particle #1 has quantum numbers p1, s1, and c1, and
particle #2 has quantum numbers p2, s2, and c2. then we can write the wave function as the sum of
two permutations:

(cid:10)g1g2(cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) =

1

2hhg1; g2| + hg2; g1|i(cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) .

this implies that the wave function (cid:10)g1g2(cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) is symmetric under exchange of particles 1 and 2.

using eq. (37), we can write the rst permutation as

(39)

(40)

(cid:10)g1; g2(cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) = xi

hc1; c2 |n,iidp1, s1; p2, s2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

3.2 calculation of the color wave function

in our two-gluon approximation, the fact that the glueball states are color singlets uniquely determines
their color wave functions. using the completeness relation for color states, the color part of the ith
contribution to the glueball state can be written

|n,ii = xc1c2

|c1; c2ihc1; c2 |n,ii .

15

(41)

let y be the unitary operator that rotates two-gluon states in color space. then under a color rotation,

we have

|n,ii (cid:12)(cid:12)

n,i(cid:11) = xc1c2

since this is true, our guess for a color-singlet wave function was correct. this solution is unique [23]; so

s1s2 (p1, p2). we must solve for jn

exchange of particles 1 and 2.

the jacobi variables x and ~k:

p1 = (xp +, x ~p + ~k),
p2 = ([1  x]p +, [1  x] ~p  ~k).

(56)

here x is the fraction of the total longitudinal momentum that is carried by particle 1, and ~k is the
transverse momentum of particle 1 in the center-of-mass frame. we only display the longitudinal and

transverse components of the momenta. (since the glueball state is a superposition of free-particle states,
and since the momentum of a free gluon satises p2 = 0, the minus components of the momenta of g1
and g2 are constrained to be given by p

i = ~p 2

i/p+

i .)

transforms according to

4 calculation of the free-state matrix element of the invari-

ant-mass operator

4.1 preliminaries

to solve the eigenvalue equation, we must calculate the matrix elements hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji.
these can be written in terms of the free-state matrix element hg
2|m2()|g1g2i, which is specied
by our renormalization procedure. we are going to calculate this matrix element to second order in

1g

perturbation theory.

before continuing, we would like to point out three simplications that we repeatedly use in this
section. to make these simplications clear, we note that the matrix elements hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji
can be written as integrals of wave functions times the free-state matrix element hg
2|m2()|g1g2i.
1g
to make the rst simplication, we observe that hg
2|m2()|g1g2i has step functions on the particles
longitudinal momenta, and these step functions are redundant because they also appear in the integrals
that dene hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji. we drop these step functions in the formulas that we present
2|m2()|g1g2i. to make the second simplication, we point out that the matrix elements
for hg

1g

1g

22

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji are symmetric under exchange of the two initial-state gluons and also under
exchange of the two nal-state gluons. because of this, when we are computing hg
2|m2()|g1g2i, we
combine terms that are related by exchange of the two initial-state or two nal-state gluons. finally, due
1g
to the color-singlet nature of the glueball states, certain parts of hg
2|m2()|g1g2i do not contribute
to hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji, and we drop these terms.

1g

we begin by dening jacobi variables for the nal state of the free matrix element:

1 = (xp +, x ~p + ~k 
p
2 = ([1  x]p +, [1  x] ~p  ~k 
p
).

),

then using the denition of the imo in terms of the reduced interaction in eqs. (1), (2), and (14),

hg

in eq. (116), if we expand everything multiplying the delta function in powers of transverse momenta,

the lowest-order terms from the two exponentials cancel and leave two types of terms: those proportional
to inverse powers of  and those proportional to inverse powers of . we can isolate the terms that are
proportional to inverse powers of  without altering the cancellation of the lowest term by replacing the

perry showed that with a suitable denition of long-range interactions, a renormalization method that
is similar to ours yields a logarithmically conning potential for quark-antiquark bound states at o(g2
)
[7]. his calculation uses sharp step-function cutos and is based on an analysis of the part of the two-body

interaction that is most singular in the limit in which the exchanged gluon has innitesimal longitudinal
2|m2()|g1g2iin+ex
momentum. the corresponding part of our interaction, which is contained in hg
and hg
in, is similar to what perry found in the quark-antiquark case. however, to
determine whether or not our interaction is truly conning, we would have to do a careful analysis of the

2|m2()|g1g2ib

complete two-body potential, not just the most singular part. this analysis would be complicated by the

smooth cuto that we employ, and we leave it for future consideration.

5 calculation of the matrix elements of the invariant-mass op-

erator in the basis for physical states

the matrix elements hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji, which appear in the eigenvalue equation, can be divided
into contributions corresponding to the dierent terms in eq. (125):

28

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji = hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jike + hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jif
+ hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jicon + hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jif
+ hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jiin+ex + hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jib
+ hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jid
se .

se

in

(126)

in this section we express these dierent contributions in terms of integrals that can be computed numer-

ically. these integrals fall into two classes: two-dimensional and ve-dimensional. we treat each class of

integral separately.

each of the terms in eq. (126) is proportional to the plane-wave normalization factor 163p +(3)(p 
p ). to make the remaining equations that we present simpler, we suppress this factor. we also take
  0 in any contribution to hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji that is nite in this limit.

5.1 the two-dimensional integrals

5.1.1 the kinetic energy

using the denition of our basis in eq. (86) and the expression for the free-state matrix element of the

kinetic energy in eq. (120), we nd that

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jike = q,q

(127)

note that the kinetic energy is innite unless e > 0, whereas normalizability requires only e > 1/2.

these integrals can be computed with standard numerical integration routines, but the results can
have large errors for large values of the function indices l, l, t, and t, due to the oscillating nature of
the basis functions. it is better to rewrite the integrals as sums that can be computed numerically with

mathematica [26] to any desired precision. using the denitions of the basis functions,

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jike = q,q

5.1.2 the finite part of the self-energy interaction

the self-energy interaction conserves each particles momentum, thus m 2
f for this contribution.
this means that the gaussian cuto factor in eq. (120) has no eect on the self-energy. for the nite

i = m 2

part of the self-energy, we use the same method for evaluating integrals that we use for the kinetic energy.

this yields

using the denition of our basis in eq. (86) and the expression for the free-state matrix element of the

contact interaction in eqs. (98) and (120), we nd that

the reader may have noticed that this integral is not ve-dimensional as we have implied, but rather four-

dimensional. however, when we numerically compute the integrals that have more than two dimensions,

it is most ecient if we combine them into one integral; so we want their integration variables and their

ranges of integration to be identical. thus we increase the number of dimensions of this integral by one
by introducing an extra integral over  =    using the identity
2 z d () (2  ).

(133)

1 =

1

this will help us to combine this integral with others that contain integrals over  that cannot be done

analytically.

since the integration domain of the exchange interaction is restricted so that x > x when   0 [note
the step function in eq. (118)], we would like to enforce this restriction in the other contributions. using

the identity

1 = (x  x) + (x  x),
we break the longitudinal integral in eq. (132) into two parts:

z dx dx (x)(1  x)(x)(1  x) l(e)

l (x) l(e)

l

(x)e42

f i [(x  x) + (x  x)].

in the second term, we let x  1  x and x  1  x, and then the longitudinal integral becomes

z dx dx (x)(1  x)(x)(1  x) l(e)

l (x) l(e)

l

(x)e42

f i (x  x)h1 + (1)l+li .

(134)

(135)

(136)

recall that we are restricting ourselves to the subspace of the states |q, l, t, ji in which l + j is even if
q 6= 4, and l + j is odd if q = 4. then since q = q for the contact interaction, l and l must both be even

30

or both be odd for this interaction. this means that the two terms in eq. (136) are equal. thus we can

write the contact interaction contribution as follows:

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jicon = 



ncg2

83 "j,2q,2q,2 + j,2q,1q,1  j,0q,3q,3#

 z d  e42

f i ,

where

and

d = dx dx dk dk d k k (x) (1  x) (x) (x  x) (k) (k) () (2  ),

 = l(e)

l (x) l(e)

l

(x)t (d)

t (k)t (d)

t

(k).

(137)

(138)

(139)

5.2.2 the finite part of the exchange interaction

in order to simplify the contribution to hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji from the nite part of the exchange
interaction, we wish to change variables from  to  =   :

d2kd2k

 = dk dk d d k k (k) (k) () (2  ) () (2  )

= dk dk d d k k (k) (k) ( + ) (2    ) () (2  ).

(140)

each of these terms is nite and we have taken   0 everywhere. we have written the rst two terms as
sums that can be computed numerically, and the four remaining terms as ve-dimensional integrals that

can be grouped into one integral suitable for numerical calculation. (see appendix c for a discussion

of some of the technical issues involved in the numerical calculation of these matrix elements.) once

we have computed these matrix elements, we can diagonalize the matrix to obtain glueball states and

masses.

6 results and error analysis

in this section we diagonalize the imo matrix, obtaining glueball states and masses. we then discuss

the sources of error in the calculation. we begin by discussing the procedure that we use to calculate the

results.

6.1 the procedure for calculating results

we represent a state using the notation j p c
our best guess for the parity of the state, c represents the charge-conjugation eigenvalue of the state (it

, where j is our best guess for the spin of the state, p is

j

is always + because we have an even number of gluons), and j is the projection of the states spin onto

the 3-axis. we need to distinguish states with identical js and p s and dierent js because we do not

have manifest rotational symmetry. if j = 0, we omit the subscript j in the state notation. we use an

asterisk in the state notation next to the value of c to denote an excited state with the given quantum

numbers. we will base our guesses for j and p on the numerical degeneracies of the states that have

identical js and p s and dierent js, and on the ordering of the states according to lattice data (see

the discussion below). we consider only the ve lightest glueballs (not counting as distinct those states
that dier only in their value of j). the ve lightest glueballs have spins j  2. this means that we
need to consider only |j|  2. for a given |j|, the states with j = |j| and j = |j| are degenerate and
simply related (see appendix c); so we explicitly consider only j = 0, 1, 2. we consider nine values of
the coupling:  = g2
/(4) = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 0.9. to calculate our results, we implement the following
four-step procedure.

we execute the rst step for all pairs (j,  ).

in this step, we dene  = 1 and diagonalize
hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji with all 4 spin basis functions (q = 1, 2, 3, 4), but with only the lowest
transverse-magnitude basis function (t = 0) and the two lowest longitudinal basis functions (l = 0, 1). (it

is necessary to use an even number of longitudinal basis functions so that symmetry and antisymmetry of
the wave function under x  1  x are equally represented.) we perform this diagonalization as a func-
tion of the basis-function parameters d and e that determine the widths of the transverse-magnitude and

36

longitudinal wave functions, respectively, and we nd the values of d and e that minimize the ground-state
mass. this yields what we consider to be the optimal wave-function widths for each pair (j,  ).

we also execute the second step of the procedure for all pairs (j,  ). in this step, we x d and e
to be their computed optimal values and again dene  = 1. we diagonalize the matrix with all 4 spin

basis functions, nt transverse-magnitude basis functions, and nl = 2nt longitudinal basis functions, for
a total of 8n 2
t basis functions, with nt = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 10. we use twice as many longitudinal functions
as transverse-magnitude functions because |q, l, t, ji is zero if l + j is even and q = 4, or if l + j is odd
and q 6= 4. we want to use as many basis functions as possible, but we nd for all pairs (j, ) that
when nt > 7, the statistical errors from the monte carlo integrations of the matrix elements become
overwhelming and the spectrum and wave functions become unreliable. the evidence of the breakdown

is sudden contamination of the low-lying wave functions with high-order components. (see appendix c

for a more complete discussion of this topic.) thus in the remainder of our procedure, we analyze the

results that we nd in this step when nt = 7, which corresponds to 392 basis functions.

in the third step of the procedure, we use the mass of the 0+ state (our most numerically reliable
state) to determine the value of  for each  . to do this, we note that  is the only mass scale in the
problem. this means that the mass of the 0+ state, m0+ , can be written

m0+ = b(),

(170)

where b is a dimensionless function of . since we dened  = 1 in the second step of our procedure,
the diagonalization of the imo as a function of  yielded b( ). in this third step, we consider  to be
a parameter and dene m0+ to be a constant. then for a given coupling, we can use the results of the
second step of our procedure to write the cuto in units of m0+:

/m0+ =

1

b()

.

(171)

figure 5 shows the result for the third step of our procedure: a plot of the coupling as a function

of the cuto. when  > 0.7 it is not a single-valued function of the cuto. this is an indication that
the coupling is too large. for this reason, we consider only   0.7 in the remainder of our procedure.
when   0.7, the coupling decreases as the cuto increases, as expected. however,  depends on
 more strongly than one may expect. we expect that perturbative pure-glue qcd would indicate
that   1/ ln , but the result that we get is much closer to   exp(a), where a is a constant.
the reason for this is that the truncation of the perturbative series for m2() and the truncation of
the free-sector expansion of the states introduce spurious cuto dependence in our results for physical

quantities. m0+ is one such physical quantity. the spurious cuto dependence of m0+ is manifested
through incorrect dependence of b() on . this means that  has to compensate by depending on
 incorrectly in order to keep m0+ a constant function of  . this results in the strong dependence
of  on  that is shown in figure 5.

using the recent anisotropic euclidean lattice results of morningstar and peardon [27], we can make

a rough estimate of the range over which our cuto is varying in figure 5. they found that the mass of
the 0+ state is m0+ = 2.590  0.040  0.130 gev. this means that our cuto is varying from about
3.1  6.0 gev in figure 5.

37

the fourth step of our procedure is to determine the optimal value of the cuto, or equivalently, the

optimal value of the coupling. we use two criteria to determine this. first we determine the value of the

cuto for which the computed masses are most independent of the cuto. figures 6, 7, and 8 show the

masses of our states with j = 0, 1, 2, respectively, as functions of the cuto. the masses and the cuto

are displayed in units of m0+. (recall that m0+ was dened to be independent of the cuto in the
process of dening the cuto as a function of the coupling.) the seven values of the cuto at the points

that we display correspond, from right to left, to  = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 0.7. it is dicult to tell from these
plots where the cuto dependence is weakest (more points are needed), but we see that the dependence

is relatively weak from  = 0.5 to  = 0.7, which corresponds to /m0+ = 1.33 to /m0+ = 1.20.
the second criterion that we use to determine the optimal cuto is the degree to which the states with

a given j and p and dierent js are degenerate. this determines the cuto that minimizes the violation
of rotational symmetry. we nd that these degeneracies are best when  = 0.5. given this and the fact
that figures 6  8 indicate that the cuto dependence of the masses is weak when  = 0.5 to  = 0.7,
we determine that  = 0.5 is the optimal coupling, and thus the optimal cuto is /m0+ = 1.33.
using the result of morningstar and peardon for the mass of the 0+ state, we estimate that this cuto
is about 3.4 gev.

6.2 results

now we present our main results. our glueball masses for  = 0.5 are summarized in table 1, in units
of the mass of the ground state (the 0++ state). table 1 also shows an average of lattice results from
a number of dierent calculations for the sake of comparison [28]. the uncertainties in our results that

we report in table 1 are only the statistical uncertainties associated with the monte carlo evaluation of
the matrix elements of m2(). the full errors are much larger (see the discussion of sources of error
below). we list three values of the masses for the 2++ and 2++ states for our calculation, corresponding
to j = 0, 1, 2. in each case the three masses would be degenerate if our calculation were exact. our

results agree with the lattice results quite well, perhaps better than we should have expected.

we display our spectrum graphically in figure 9. the masses are plotted in units of the mass of
the 0++ state and the vertical widths of the levels represent the statistical uncertainties in the masses.
the black lines connect the states that we believe should be degenerate. we see that the 2++
and 2++
glueballs are relatively degenerate with their 2++
is not too bad,
but the 2++
expected degeneracies are based on the ordering of the lattice states (see table 1) and the apparent
degeneracies of the 2++

glueball is much too light. our labeling of the states and subsequent assignment of the

we want to show some of the features of the glueball wave functions. rather than presenting the

spin-dependent wave functions themselves, we present more illuminating spin-independent probability

we show the probability densities for some of our glueballs in figures 10  14. the masses of the
states tend to increase as the probability densities move away from the region x  1/2 and more towards
the edges. this is what we expect based on the form of the kinetic energy of a free state. notice that
the probability density for the 2++
glueball is peaked around the region x  1/2 and looks similar to the
probability density for the 0++ glueball. this is consistent with its small mass.

6.3 error analysis

we now turn to a discussion of the sources of error in our calculation. the sources of error are:

 truncation of the renormalized imo at o(g2
 );
 truncation of the free-sector expansion of physical states at two gluons;
 truncation of the basis-function expansion of wave functions;
 numerical approximation of the matrix elements of m2().
we do not know how to estimate the size of any physical eects that require nonperturbative renor-

malization. however, we can naively estimate the size of the eects of higher-order perturbative renor-
malization. we have calculated the matrix elements of m2() through o( ); so the corrections to
these matrix elements should be o(2
 /2).
since we have used  = 0.5, we estimate that the uncertainty in the mass spectrum from the eects of
higher-order perturbative renormalization is about 13%.

 ). this translates to corrections to the mass spectrum of o(2

we do not know how to estimate the size of any physical eects that require an innite number of

particles. in fact, until we include at least two free sectors, it is impossible to directly estimate the size
of corrections from higher free sectors. however, we can use the lack of degeneracy of the 2++
with the 2++
states to estimate these corrections. according to table 1, the discrepancy in the
various 2++ states is about 33%, if we believe the quoted lattice result. since the uncertainty in the mass
spectrum from eects of higher-order perturbative renormalization is around 13%, an uncertainty of 30%

and 2++

due to the truncation of the free-sector expansion is necessary to explain the lack of rotational symmetry

in the spectrum (neglecting the other sources of error, which we expect to be small).

as we mentioned, when we increase the number of basis functions that we use to represent the wave

functions, we nd that we reach a point where the statistical errors from the monte carlo evaluations

of the matrix elements are overwhelming and cause our results to become completely unreliable (see

appendix c). for this reason, we have to truncate our basis-function expansion for the wave functions at

nt = 7 transverse-magnitude functions. (nl = 2nt = 14, and there are 4 spin basis functions, for a total
of 392 basis functions.) this truncation results in additional errors in our results. in figures 15, 16, and

39

17, we show the convergence of the masses of the states with j = 0, 1, 2 respectively, as functions of nt.
the masses do not decrease as rapidly as functions of the number of states as one might expect. this

is primarily because we have already optimized the states quite a bit by determining the widths of the
transverse-magnitude and longitudinal basis functions that minimize the mass of the 0++ state (using
nt = 1). our best guess for the uncertainty that we introduce into the spectrum when we truncate the
basis-function expansion, based on figures 15  17, is a few percent12.

we can estimate the uncertainty in our results associated with the monte carlo evaluation of our
matrix elements. to do this, we compute our results with  = 0.5 four times, obtaining statistically
independent results, and we compute the standard deviations of the masses that we obtain. this leads

us to estimate that the uncertainty in the spectrum from the monte carlo routine is 1  2%. this is the

uncertainty that we report in table 1 and figure 9. combining this uncertainty with the others leads us

to estimate that the total uncertainty in our results is about 33%.

12technically, this is not an uncertainty because improving the states can only reduce their masses, according to the

variational principle. however, our discussion of errors is not meant to be rigorous.

7 conclusion

we have presented a formalism for pure-glue qcd that allows the physical states of the theory to rapidly

converge in a free-sector expansion. in this approach, we force the free-state matrix elements of the imo

to satisfy three conditions to make the desired expansion possible. first, the diagonal matrix elements

of the imo must be dominated by the free part of the imo. second, the o-diagonal matrix elements of

the imo must quickly decrease as the dierence of the free masses of the states increases. third, the free

mass of a free state must quickly increase as the number of particles in the state increases.

we assume that we can use perturbation theory to derive the operators of the theory, and if this

is valid, then the rst condition is automatically satised. to satisfy the second condition, we place a

smooth cuto on the imo. we use lfft so that the eects of the vacuum are isolated in particles with

zero longitudinal momentum, and we remove these particles from the theory with the intent of replacing

their physical eects with interactions. this makes it reasonable to expect that the third condition on

the imo is satised automatically due to the free-particle dispersion relation of lfft.

the cuto that we use violates a number of physical principles of light-front pure-glue qcd. however,

by requiring the imo to produce cuto-independent physical quantities and by requiring it to respect

the unviolated physical principles of the theory, we are able to derive recursion relations that uniquely

determine the imo to all orders in perturbation theory.

we have applied our method to the calculation of physical states and masses. for this calculation,

we approximated all physical states as two-gluon states. we calculated the color parts of the states

analytically, and we expanded the states momentum and spin degrees of freedom in terms of basis

functions. we designed the states to be simultaneous eigenstates of the imo, the three-momentum

operator, and the projection of the internal rotation generator onto the 3-axis.

using our recursion relations for the imo, we calculated to second order in perturbation theory the

two-gluon to two-gluon matrix element of the imo, which is required for the calculation of physical states.

we then used it to calculate the imo matrix in terms of the basis functions. we showed that the infrared

divergences in the matrix from exchanged gluons with innitesimal longitudinal momentum cancel when

treated properly.

in order to diagonalize the imo matrix, we computed the ve-dimensional integrals in the matrix

elements using monte carlo methods. we calculated the glueball spectrum for a range of couplings and

found that we could not use more than about 400 basis functions without the statistical errors becoming
overwhelming. we used the mass of our 0+ glueball to compute the nonperturbative cuto dependence
of the coupling, and we analyzed the cuto dependence of the spectrum. we found that the cuto

that minimizes our errors is /m0+ = 1.33. the corresponding coupling is  = 0.5. we presented
the probability densities for some of our glueballs and found that our results for the spectrum compare
favorably with recent lattice data. the largest discrepancy seems to be the 2++
light. finally, we analyzed the errors in our calculation from the various possible sources, and estimated

state, which is much too

2

the total uncertainty in our spectrum to be 33%.

there are two main paths that we can take for future work with our approach. the rst path is

to further test our method with the theories that we have considered so far. since the scalar theory

55

that we considered in ref.

[1] is relatively simple, it would be interesting to use it compute the imo

to higher orders in perturbation theory. this would require us to solve the integral equation for the

cuto-independent reduced interaction and could be used to further check our conjecture that our imo

leads to correct scattering amplitudes order-by-order in perturbation theory.

in pure-glue qcd, we can further test our approach for calculating physical states by computing the

imo to higher orders in perturbation theory and by keeping more free sectors in the expansion of the

states. however, to keep more free sectors in the expansion of the states, we have to be able to calculate

imo matrices that have more degrees of freedom, while controlling the statistical errors in the spectrum.

this means that we need a better algorithm for determining how accurately individual matrix elements

of the imo have to be computed in order to get a desired uncertainty in the spectrum. we could also use

a better basis that requires fewer momentum functions to represent a wave function. overcoming these

problems will be challenging, but it is important to test our method by studying the rate of convergence

of the free-sector expansion of states as a function of both the cuto and the masses of the states.

another test of our method that we can do with pure-glue qcd is to analyze the interaction that

we have derived in this paper to test the conjecture that it is logarithmically conning. it would also be

interesting to analyze the long-range parts of higher-order interactions to see if the perturbative series

for the interaction is building towards a linearly conning potential. analyzing the long-range parts of

higher-order interactions may be much easier than computing these interactions in their entirety.

the second main path that we can take in the future is to extend our method to other theories and

operators. in order to compute quantities that can be compared with experiment, we wish to extend
our method to full qcd13. this is complicated for two reasons. first, there is additional algebraic
and numerical complexity from the the vertices involving quarks. second, quark masses complicate the

method for determining the imo because they increase the number of reduced interactions that can be

cuto-independent [18]. in addition, if large and small quark masses are considered simultaneously, then

ecient numerical representation of the states and accurate calculation of the imos matrix elements

become more dicult. masses also quickly enlarge the parameter space that must be explored to compare

to experimental data.

we can also extend our method by applying it to the computation of operators other than the imo,

such as the rotation generators, the parity operator, and currents. the rotation generators and the parity

operator are of particular interest because they may aid in the classication of the physical states of a

theory.

in summary, there are many avenues of research that must be explored, and some of them are quite

complex. however, all the improvements that we have discussed are necessary if we are to accurately

represent the physical states of quantum eld theories as rapidly convergent expansions in free sectors.

13we are not thinking of including qcd eects that require nonperturbative renormalization or an innite number of

particles because these would require a new method rather than an extension of our current approach.

greek indices are lorentz indices, cs are color indices, repeated indices are summed over, and the f s

are the su(nc) structure constants.

we derive the canonical hamiltonian from l by the following procedure:
1. we choose the light-cone gauge, a+

c = 0.

57

2. we derive the euler-lagrange equation that determines a

c in terms of ~ac.

3. using the canonical procedure and treating the eld classically (i.e.

letting it and its derivatives
commute), we derive the hamiltonian in terms of ~ac, dropping terms that are zero if the gluon
eld is zero at spacetime innity.

4. we quantize the gluon eld by expanding it in terms of free-particle creation and annihilation

operators. (we dene the eld expansion and its inverse longitudinal derivative below.)

5. in each term in the hamiltonian, we treat the creation and annihilation operators as if they commute

and move all the creation operators to the left of all the annihilation operators. (this normal

ordering drops the so-called self-inertias, as well as some constants.)

6. we drop the terms in the hamiltonian that have no eect if there are no particles with p+ = 0.

we work in the schrodinger representation, where operators are time-independent and states are

time-dependent. thus we quantize the eld by dening it to be a superposition of solutions to the
klein-gordon equation (since gluons are bosons), with the quantization surface x+ = 0:

~ac(x, ~x) = z d1c,c1ha1~s1eip1x + a

here si is the spin polarization of particle i, p is the four-momentum operator,  is a positive innitesimal,
and the gluon polarization vector is dened by

~s = 1
2

(s, i).

(187)

p+ and ~p are the momenta conjugate to x and ~x; so they are referred to as the longitudinal and
transverse momenta, respectively. the purpose of  is to regulate divergent eects from exchanged
gluons (either instantaneous or real) with innitesimal longitudinal momentum. we take   0 before
we calculate physical quantities (see section 5).

in the process of deriving the canonical hamiltonian, we need to take the inverse longitudinal derivative

of the gluon eld. we do this by moving the derivative inside the expansion:

let m2 be the invariant-mass operator. the momentum conjugate to x+ is p; so the hamiltonian

is identied as p  and it follows from

appendix b: the derivation of the recursion relations for the reduced

interaction

this appendix is an extension of appendix d of ref. [1] to the case of pure-glue qcd. in subsection

2.4, we derived a constraint on the o(gr

) reduced interaction for r  1:
cd() = v (r) 

r1

brs,sv (rs)().

v (r)
cd()  v (r)

xs=2

(210)

since we already know the rst-order reduced interaction [see eq. (18)] and the cuto-independent part
of the second-order reduced interaction [see eq. (19)], we wish to use this equation to compute v (r)
cd()
for r  2 and v (r)

for r  3, in terms of lower-order reduced interactions.

ci

b.1 the recursion relation for the cuto-dependent part

we begin by computing the recursion relation for the cuto-dependent part of the reduced interaction.

recall that momentum conservation implies that any matrix element of v () can be written as an

expansion in unique products of momentum-conserving delta functions. this means that an arbitrary

matrix element of eq. (210) can be expanded in products of delta functions:

xi

hf| v (r)

cd()|ii(i) xi

hf| v (r)

cd()|ii(i) =xi "hf| v (r) |ii 

r1

xs=2

brs,s hf| v (rs)()|ii#(i)

, (211)

where the (i) superscripts denote that we are considering the ith product of delta functions that can
occur in a delta-function expansion of hf| v (r)()|ii. this equation is equivalent to a set of equations,
one for each possible product of delta functions:

hf| v (r)

cd()|ii(i)  hf| v (r)

cd()|ii(i) ="hf| v (r) |ii 

brs,s hf| v (rs)()|ii#(i)

.

r1

xs=2

cluster decomposition implies that we can write

includes a longitudinal-momentum factor), n (i)
is the number of delta functions in the ith product, and
f (i)
cd is a function of the cuto and the quantum numbers of the particles in the matrix element, but does
not contain delta functions that x momenta. we dene npart to be the number of particles in state |ii
plus the number of particles in state |fi, and n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , npart. the momentum, spin polarization,
and color of particle n are given by pn, sn, and cn. we dene n (i)
int to be the number of particles in the
matrix element that participate in an interaction for the ith product of delta functions. in order for the
imo to have the dimensions (mass)2, f (i)
int . note that we are
suppressing the dependence of the rhs of this equation on r.

cd must have the dimensions (mass)4n (i)

we have assumed that any matrix element of the imo can be expanded in powers of transverse

momenta, not including the momentum-conserving delta functions; so

subject to the constraint that

4  n (i)

int xn,t

mnt 6= 0,

(215)

which is necessary to avoid terms in the momentum expansion that are cuto-independent. the z{mnt}

the particles longitudinal momenta, spin polarizations, and colors.

cd({pn},{sn},{cn}, ) = g(i)({pn},{sn},{cn}, , ),

(217)

where the momenta in this equation are constrained by the delta-function conditions.

since the lhs of eq. (217) is the dierence of a function of  and the same function with   ,
g(i) must be as well. since the lhs of eq. (217) can be expanded in powers of transverse momenta, g(i)

eq. (228) places constraints on the possible cuto-independent contributions to the reduced interac-
int  2, but eq. (228) can only hold if

tion. any contribution to a matrix element of v (r)() has an n (i)
n (i)
int  4.
suppose that n (i)

int = 2. in this case, eq. (228) implies that f (i)

ci is quadratic in transverse momenta.
due to approximate cluster decomposition, only interacting particles transverse momenta can appear in
ci . so any contribution to f (i)
f (i)
ci can depend on the transverse momenta of two interacting particles.
thus f (i)
ci can be written as a sum of terms, where each term corresponds to a distinct pair of interacting
particles. the momentum dependence of each term in f (i)
ci is limited to dependence on the momenta of
the interacting particles and the total longitudinal momentum:

the delta-function product in eq. (226). this means that f (i)

in the remainder of this appendix, we assume that r is odd. then we need to consider only n (i)
initially. we expand eq. (230) in powers of transverse momenta and keep only the linear term:

int = 3

now we can sum over all values of i corresponding to three-point interactions:

to use this equation, we also need to use eq. (230) to solve for v (r+1)

. since r is odd, r + 1 is even.

thus v (r+1)
analogous to those that led to eq. (233), we nd that

before concluding this appendix, we would like to deduce a bit more about the relationship of g to
g . according to eq. (27) and the surrounding discussion, this relationship is determined by the matrix
element hg2g3| v |g1i, which can be expanded in powers of g :



14it is very dicult to prove that integral equations of this type have a unique solution; so we simply assume that it is

hg2g3| v |g1i =

 hg2g3| v (t) |g1i .
gt

true in this case.

recall that v (t) is built from products of v (r)()s. this implies that v (t) can change particle number
by 1 only if t is odd, and thus eq. (235) implies that the coupling runs at odd orders; i.e. cs is zero if s
is even [see eq. (29)].

appendix c: technical issues in the numerical calculation of matrix

elements

in this appendix, we discuss some of the technical issues involved in the numerical calculation of the
matrix elements hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji. in section c.1 we discuss how we put the matrix elements
into a form that is amenable to numerical calculation. in section c.2 we briey cover three topics: we
show how the glueball state with j r
3 eigenvalue j can be written in terms of the glueball state with
j r
3 eigenvalue j, we list a few tricks that allow us to reduce the number of matrix elements that we must
compute, and we present our method for estimating how numerical uncertainties in the matrix elements

translate into uncertainties in the spectrum.

c.1 preparation of integrals for monte carlo

there are two types of contributions to hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji: nite sums and ve-dimensional
integrals. we use mathematica [26] to evaluate the nite sums to as many digits as we wish. to evaluate

the integrals, we combine them into one integral and use the vegas monte carlo routine [29]. it takes

a bit of work to put the integral into a form that will converge.

there are two main diculties with getting the integral to converge. the rst diculty is that
hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jib,f
in looks divergent: as x  x, the sum in eq. (168) diverges. this divergence
is misleading because it actually contributes nothing to the integral (assuming that we calculate the

integral carefully; see the discussion below). left unchecked, this false divergence prevents the integral

from converging with vegas. to rectify the problem, we want to subtract the false divergence from the

integrand. since it integrates to zero, this is allowed.

the second main diculty with getting the integral to converge is roundo error. even after we
subtract the false divergence from the integrand, the integrand peaks around x = x, and in this region
there are large cancellations in some of the quantities that we have dened. to prevent these cancellations

from causing roundo error, we rewrite these quantities so that the cancellations are explicit, before we

turn to numerics.

c.1.1 subtraction of the false divergence

we begin by dening a set of variables that is natural for dealing with the false divergence. we dene

we change variables from ~k and ~k 

 to the dimensionless transverse variables ~r and ~w:

 = x  x.

~r =

~w =

(~k + ~k

we dene the angle between ~r and ~w to be :

we also dene

~r  ~w = rw cos .

68

(236)

(237)

(238)

and then we can derive a host of useful relations:

(243)

to avoid roundo error, we have dened simplied dimensionless versions of the dierences of the free

masses and the derivatives of these dierences:

r2(1  x  x) + w22(1  x  x)  2wr(x[1  x] + x[1  x]) cos 
r2 + w2(1  x + 1  x)2 + 2rw(1  x + 1  x) cos

.

eq. (242) is now dimensionless, except for the factor in front of the integral, which is proportional to
1/d2.

69

as x  x (  0), the contributions to the integrand from the rst and second terms in the sum

diverge. in the limit x  x, the contribution to the integral from these terms can be written15

an examination of this integral reveals a problem: the transverse integrals are zero and the longitudinal

integrals are innite. to solve this problem, we consider what would have happened if we had not yet
taken   0. in this case, the transverse integrals would be zero and the longitudinal integrals would be
nite. thus the   0 limit of this integral would be zero. this means that this integral is actually zero,
and we can subtract it from the full integral in eq. (242):

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jib,f
in = 
 " wq,q t t(r)t t(r+)e(d)4( 2

(246)

once we have performed this subtraction, there is no ambiguity about the value of the full integral, and

it converges when computed numerically.

c.1.2 combination of the integrals

we now combine all the ve-dimensional integrals into one integral:

we have rewritten the integrand of hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jiin+ex to eliminate large roundo errors,
at the expense of making it more complicated. to further avoid roundo errors, we rewrite a few of the
s(i)
q,q s:

s(1)
3,3 = cos(j)(22 + 2(1  2x) + (1  2x)2),
s(3)
3,4 =  sin  sin(j)(22[1  2x] + [1  6x + 6x2]  2x[1  3x + 2x2]),
s(1)
4,4 = cos(j)(1  2x)(1 + 2  2x).

(249)

note that to compute some of the trigonometric functions that appear in this integral [such as cos(j)]

in terms of the integration variables, it is necessary to use recursion relations that dene these functions

in terms of cos  and sin  so that we can use eq. (240).

the integral in eq. (247) converges slowly. this is because it is strongly peaked when x  x, even
though we have subtracted the false divergence. to spread out this region, we change variables from x
to p where

now the integral is

c.2 miscellaneous issues

c.2.1 rotational symmetry: j  j

to compute the glueball spectrum, we compute the matrix hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji and diagonalize
it for each value of j separately. for a given |j|, the matrices with j = |j| and j = |j| are simply related,
and we can use this fact to avoid computing and diagonalizing both of them. by inspection, we determine

that

where

hq, l, t,j|m2()|q, l, t,ji = xq,q hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji f (q, q)f (q, q),

f (q, q) = q,1q,2 + q,2q,1 + q,3q,3  q,4q,4.

(254)

(255)

this simply means that the basis |q, l, t,ji is related to the basis |q, l, t, ji by swapping the states
|1, l, t, ji and |2, l, t, ji, and changing the sign of |4, l, t, ji. renaming basis states and changing their

phases has no eect on the eigenvalues of the matrix; so (cid:12)(cid:12)(j)n(p )(cid:11) has the same mass as (cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11). it

also means that since

(cid:12)(cid:12)jn(p )(cid:11) = xqlt

rjn
qlt |q, l, t, ji

= xlt hrjn

1lt |1, l, t, ji + rjn

2lt |2, l, t, ji + rjn

3lt |3, l, t, ji + rjn

4lt |4, l, t, jii ,

(256)

(257)

we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(j)n(p )e = xlt hrjn

1lt |2, l, t, ji + rjn
rjn
qltf (q, q)|q, l, t, ji .

= xqqlt

2lt |1, l, t, ji + rjn

3lt |3, l, t, ji  rjn

4lt |4, l, t, jii

thus by diagonalizing hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji, we also obtain the eigenvalues and eigenstates of
hq, l, t,j|m2()|q, l, t,ji.

c.2.2 reducing the number of matrix elements to compute

there are a few facts that allow us to reduce the number of matrix elements that we have to compute.
first, because of gluon-exchange symmetry, the basis state |q, l, t, ji is zero if l + j is even and q = 4, or
if l + j is odd and q 6= 4. second, m2() is hermitian, and its matrix elements in this basis are real; so
it is symmetric in this basis. third, by inspection, we see that

finally, there are some redundancies and additional zeros in the matrix when j = 0:

h1, l, t, j|m2()|2, l, t, ji = 0.

h2, l, t, 0|m2()|2, l, t, 0i = h1, l, t, 0|m2()|1, l, t, 0i ,
h1, l, t, 0|m2()|3, l, t, 0i = h2, l, t, 0|m2()|3, l, t, 0i ,
h1, l, t, 0|m2()|4, l, t, 0i =  h2, l, t, 0|m2()|4, l, t, 0i ,
h3, l, t, 0|m2()|4, l, t, 0i = 0.

72

(258)

(259)

c.2.2 estimating uncertainties in the spectrum

when we use the vegas monte carlo routine to compute the matrix elements, the results for the

matrix elements have statistical uncertainties.

in order to control the resulting uncertainties in the

spectrum, we would like to have a method that allows us to estimate how accurately we must calculate

any given matrix element in order for the spectrum to have a desired uncertainty.

suppose a diagonal matrix element hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji is given by

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji = z  ,

(260)

where z is the monte carlo estimate of the matrix element and  is the associated absolute uncertainty.

using mathematica with test matrices, it is straightforward to convince oneself that if  is small, then
n  /z in the eigenvalues of the matrix16. this translates to a

it will yield a relative uncertainty e
relative uncertainty of emn  /(2z) in the masses.

estimating the uncertainty in the spectrum due to uncertainties in o-diagonal matrix elements is

m 2

more dicult. using mathematica with test matrices, the simplest method that we have found that is

reasonably reliable is to use a type of degenerate perturbation theory. when we have an o-diagonal

matrix element given by

we diagonalize the two matrices

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji = z  ,

(261)

(262)

(263)

(264)

and

  hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji

z + 

  hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji ! ,

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji ! .

and we compare their eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the matrix

m 2
n

to be the largest relative deviation that we have found in the eigenvalues, and we

we then dene e
estimate the resulting relative uncertainty in the mass spectrum to be emn  e
to work well unless there are too many diagonal matrix elements that are nearly degenerate with either
hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji or hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji.

/2. this estimate tends

to achieve a relative uncertainty of o() in the glueball masses, we require emn <  for each matrix
element. this method tends to work reasonably well. the main diculty is that we have neglected to

m 2
n

consider the highly nonlinear couplings between the uncertainties in dierent matrix elements. for this

reason, as we increase the size of the matrix, the error in our estimate of the uncertainty eventually

becomes critical. at this point, the spectrum that we get when we diagonalize the matrix becomes

completely unreliable. (the evidence of the breakdown is sudden contamination of the low-lying wave

functions with high-order components.) it should be possible to develop more sophisticated methods of

estimating uncertainties to suppress this problem.

16in the development of this method, we are guided by the principles of quantum-mechanical perturbation theory, although

we cannot legitimately use perturbation theory to analyze the uncertainties.
