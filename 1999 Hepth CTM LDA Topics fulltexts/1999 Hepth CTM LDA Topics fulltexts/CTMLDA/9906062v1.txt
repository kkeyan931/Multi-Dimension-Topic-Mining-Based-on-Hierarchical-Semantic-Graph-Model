universality is a central concept in todays understanding of how renor-
malizable theories arise from unknown microscopic physics at distances
much smaller than directly observable by experiment. the precise form of
the microscopic action does not matter  a fact extensively used in lattice
simulations of qcd. for example, we may add to the microscopic lagrangian
of qcd a four-quark interaction

l = h2(cid:18) ai(cid:18)1  5

2 (cid:19) ib(cid:19) (m2

without altering the predictions at observable distances. (here i, j and a, b
are color and avor indices.) at the microscopic scale the parameters h and
m are arbitrary as long as m is not much smaller than the inverse micro-
scopic length scale , such that l remains essentially local. in contrast,
eective couplings of the type (1) at some scale k   become calculable in
terms of the renormalized gauge coupling.
field representations are not a universal feature. in fact, we may inter-
pret l as arising from integrating out a heavy scalar eld with yukawa
interaction h to the quarks.
in principle, the choice of elds used to de-
scribe a given universality class is a matter of convenience, provided they
account for the light physical particles and the symmetries governing their
interactions.

duality is a powerful tool which can be used to relate dierent eld de-
scriptions for a given universality class. each description may be optimal
for a given momentum scale k or a given size of the relevant coupling con-
stants. for example, the nonlinear o(3)-heisenberg model in two dimensions
is asymptotically free. at long distances the dimensionless coupling grows
and produces a non-perturbative mass by dimensional transmutation. by
virtue of these similarities this model has often been considered as a pro-
totype for qcd. in the non-linear -model description the nonperturbative
behavior for large coupling appears to be quite complicated. in contrast, a
dual description in terms of a linear -model has provided [1] a very sim-
ple successful picture of the strong coupling region  it is simply given by
a massive o(3)-symmetric scalar eld theory. for qcd, we would like to
have a similar simple dual description for scales where the gauge coupling
is large. we already know the relevant degrees of freedom from experiment:
for bosons these are the light mesons and we have to search for gluon-meson
duality. for fermions the light degrees of freedom are the baryon octet  we
therefore also need quark-baryon duality. in this note we propose such a sim-
ple dual description by using additional scalar elds. the essential features
of connement are described by the higgs phenomenon for colored scalar
elds, which turns the gluons into massive vector mesons. the equivalence
of the connement or higgs descriptions has, in principle, been known for a
long time [2]. it was recently used in order to establish that there is no phase
transition in the high temperature electroweak standard model [3] and for a
discussion of properties of high density quark or nuclear matter [4].

in addition to the quark and gluon elds we consider scalar elds with
the transformation properties of quark-antiquark pairs. with respect to
the color and chiral avor rotations su(3)c  su(3)l  su(3)r the three
light left-handed and right-handed quarks l, r transform as (3,3,1) and
(3,1,3), respectively. quark-antiquark bilinears therefore contain a color sin-
glet (1, 3, 3) and a color octet (8, 3, 3)

here we use a matrix notation for the avor indices and write the color
indices explicitly, e.g. ai  i, ij,ab  ij, ab  . then ij contains 81
complex scalar elds. we consider an eective lagrangian with terms up to
dimension four

in a renormalization group framework the parameters appearing in (2)
should be considered as running coupling constants. for instance, we may

associate k = r d4xl with the eective average action [5] which exhibits

an infrared cuto k. the vacuum properties and the physical particle spec-
trum should be extracted for k = 0. for short-distance scattering processes,
however, one may account for the momentum dependence of the vertices by

2

using for k an appropriate momentum scale. our description should coincide
with perturbative qcd for large k.

let us expand u0 = m2

 t r ijij + ... and assume that for
large k both m2
 are large and positive. then the additional scalar
excitations will eectively decouple. whereas the expectation value <  >

(6)

this is the only relevant eect of the additional degrees of freedom and
exactly what is needed for perturbative qcd! we have explicitly checked
that in leading order the running of the quark masses only arises from gluon
diagrams. (the sources j are constant and the eects of the running scalar
wave function renormalization z drop out.) in fact, for large m2
 and m2

it is straightforward to integrate out the scalar degrees of freedom. the
eld  produces a correction l given by (1) and the quark mass term
(6), whereas from  we obtain higher-order gluon interactions by expanding
  d2[a]) with d2 the covariant laplacian and a term similar to
t r ln(m2
(1). the corrections are nonrenormalizable interactions which are irrelevant
by standard universality arguments. in fact, the scalar elds in k may be
viewed as a shorthand for the presence of these nonrenormalizable quark and
gluon interactions in the eective action. one can therefore compute the
couplings appearing in (3) at large scales (say k = 10 gev) in a perturbative
qcd calculation of eective vertices like (1).

due to the presence of quark uctuations the mass terms m2

 and m2

decrease as k is lowered. perturbation theory breaks down once m2
 or m2

are of the same size as k2. it is our central postulate that the mass terms
turn negative in the nonperturbative region of small k, inducing nonzero
expectation values2 for both <  > and <  > even for j = 0.

in an intermediate range of k below  700 mev the ow of m2

 has been
discussed previously in a linear quark-meson model [6]. this is related to the
present picture by neglecting the gluons and . in the linear quark-meson
model chiral symmetry breaking was indeed observed due to m2
 turning
negative for small k. at least for small enough k the eects of connement
and therefore the gluons should play an important role, however. they are
included here by adding  and a.

we suggest that the essential features of connement are described by
nonzero <  > in the range of very small k. in the absence of quark masses
we propose

with real 0 > 0. this expectation value is invariant under vectorlike su(3)
transformations by which identical left and right avor rotations and trans-
posed color rotations are performed with opposite angles. with respect to
the transposed color rotations the quarks behave as antitriplets. in conse-
quence, under the combined transformation they transform as an octet plus
a singlet, with all quantum numbers identical to the baryon octet/singlet. in
particular, the electric charges, as given by the generator q = 1
238,
are integer. we therefore identify the quark eld with the lowest baryon octet
and singlet  this is quark-baryon duality. similarly, the gluons transform as
an octet of vector-mesons, again with the standard charges for the , k and
/ mesons. we therefore describe these vector mesons by the gluon eld 
this is gluon-meson duality.

in order to visualize the physical content in this regime, it is convenient
to use nonlinear coordinates in eld space, given by a hermitean matrix s
and unitary matrices u, v

we also adopt a matrix notation for the color indices with the quark/baryon
nonet represented by a complex 3  3 matrix   ai,   ia. besides v
all nonlinear elds are color singlets. for the present investigation we omit
the scalar excitations except for the goldstone bosons contained in u. we
can therefore replace xkl,ab by the expectation value (7) and use < s >= 0
such that

with v = vv ig[v, v]. as it should be, l does not depend on v,

inferring g  6 from the decay width   2 (and keeping in mind
corrections up to 30 % from nonzero quark masses), the agreement between
(14) and (15) is striking for x not too small. this implies g  12.
in
the gluon language our result corresponds to a nite strong gauge coupling
s  12. one also nds the eective coupling of nucleons to the -vector
mesons gn n = g .. the pseudoscalar self-interactions take the standard form
implied by chiral perturbation theory. the pion nucleon coupling in (10) is
not yet in its denite form since the left- and right-handed nucleon elds
can still be redened by a common (non-integer) power of u. finally, the
-mass is m 2
 = 30/2. within a large range of potential parameters the
source term (4) leads to realistic masses of the pseudoscalar mesons consistent
with chiral perturbation theory. electromagnetic and weak interactions are
included by gauging the appropriate avor symmetries.

we conclude that the simple eective action (3) can give a realistic ap-
proximate description of the masses of all low-lying mesons and baryons and
of their interactions. gluon-meson duality turns out to be the well-known
higgs phenomenon with colored scalar elds! the eective action (3) is only
an approximation, but its phenomenological success hints to the possibility
that higher-order (nonrenomalizable) operators may only play a sublead-
ing role. higher mass meson and baryon resonances are considered as bound
states of the elds used here. at this stage we did not attempt to calculate
the parameters appearing in the potential or the yukawa couplings h, h from
the known short-distance physics. the non-perturbative ow equation [5] for
the average action seems to be the appropriate tool for this purpose. only

after a calculation of 0 and 0 in terms of qcd we can decide if the pro-
posed eld content and the truncation to a renormalizable eective action
are sucient to solve the connement problem quantitatively.3

the present framework opens new perspectives for a calculation of the
properties of hadronic matter at high temperature and density. especially
for high density the issue of baryons vs. quarks plays a crucial role due
to the dierent fermi surfaces [7]. quark-baryon duality allows for a sim-
ple approach to this problem by using only one eld. recently, a picture of
color-avor-locking has been proposed [4] for dense baryonic or quark matter.
this ressembles our picture of the qcd-vacuum in many respects. if true,
the question of a phase transition for high density hadronic matter at zero
temperature reduces to the issue of spontaneous breaking of baryon symme-
try: one may expect a second-order phase transition in the universality class
of superuid he4 if baryon number is broken in the high density region, and
a continuous behavior otherwise.

quark-baryon duality has profound implications. the nonrelativistic
quark model where baryons are bound states of three quarks is now sup-
plemented by the view of baryons as dressed quarks.
in a high energy
scattering process physical quarks will come out, but they will come out
with the quantum numbers and masses of baryons. in this sense, quarks are
not conned particles, despite the fact that color charges remain exactly con-
ned and cannot appear connected with free particles. this view may have
important consequences for our picture of the parton model, both for struc-
ture functions at small q2 and for fragmentation. in a rst crude approach to
fragmentation one may simply treat the perturbative quarks as particles with
the appropriate masses of the baryons, associating the quantum numbers in
the octet to color and avor of the perturbative quarks according to (8) with
v = u = 1. the same holds for the gluons which are now regulated in the
infrared by the vector boson masses.
in a second step one has to include
the production of pseudoscalar mesons. obviously, many new questions and
problems open up with this view. we hope that besides its conceptual sim-
plicity gluon-meson and quark-hadron duality also opens new perspectives
for quantitative calculations.

3it is an important advantage of our setting that the explicit chiral symmetry breaking
by quark mass terms appears only through a linear source term. the computation of l is
independent of the quark masses and the results hold for arbitrary j.
