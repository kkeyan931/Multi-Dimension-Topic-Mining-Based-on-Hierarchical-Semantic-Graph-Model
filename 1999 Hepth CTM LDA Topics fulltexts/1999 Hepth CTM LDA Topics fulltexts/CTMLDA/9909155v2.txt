recently it was proposed that matching of global charges induced in vacuum by slowly
varying, topologically non-trivial scalar elds provides consistency conditions analogous to
the t hooft anomaly matching conditions. we study matching of induced charges in su-
persymmetric su (n ) gauge theories with quantum modied moduli space. we nd that
the wesszumino term should be present in the low energy theory in order that these con-
sistency conditions are satised. we calculate the lowest homotopy groups of the quantum
moduli space, and show that there are no obstructions to the existence of the wesszumino
term at arbitrary n . the explicit expression for this term is given. it is shown that neither
vortices nor topological solitons exist in the model. the case of softly broken supersymmetry
is considered as well. we nd that the possibility of global baryon number violating vacuum
is strongly disfavored.

i. introduction

low-energy dynamics of gauge theories strongly cou-
pled in the infrared often can be described in terms of
eective theories. for instance, the soft limit of quantum
chromodynamics (qcd) is the theory of self-interacting
pion elds. in more sophisticated models (e.g., supersym-
metric gauge theories), the eective low-energy theories
exhibit interesting content of composite fermions as well.
this property may be important for the construction of
composite models of quarks and leptons.

most of the results concerning the infrared behavior
of supersymmetric gauge theories are obtained without
detailed calculations which are problematic in the strong
coupling domain. instead, one makes use of general prop-
erties, such as symmetries and holomorphy. one of the
most powerful tools for constraining the low-energy spec-
tra is provided by the t hooft anomaly matching con-
ditions [1]. namely, one introduces topologically non-
trivial background gauge elds corresponding to the a-
vor symmetry group and checks that the anomalies in
global currents are the same in the microscopic and
eective theories. the basis for the anomaly match-
ing conditions is provided by the adler-bardeen non-
renormalization theorem [2].

recently,

it was suggested to consider topologically
non-trivial, slowly varying in space scalar elds as other
probes of eective theories [3]. the corresponding match-
ing conditions emerge due to the fact that such back-
ground scalar elds generically induce global charges in
vacuum. these charges are the quantities which should
match in the microscopic and low energy descriptions of
the model. the non-renormalization theorem justifying
these matching conditions was proven in ref. [4].

induced charge matching in supersymmetric qcd
(sqcd) with su (nc) gauge group and the number of
avors nf larger than the number of colors has been

discussed in refs. [3,4]. models with softly broken super-
symmetry were also considered there and it was found
that in the latter case the induced charge matching con-
ditions provide new information in addition to the t
hooft conditions. the present paper is devoted to the
study of induced charge matching in sqcd at nf = nc
when the quantum deformation of the moduli space takes
place [5]. it is shown that all constraints are satised pro-
vided the term analogous to the wesszumino term in
qcd is added. this term has been already constructed
in the case of su (2) gauge group in ref. [6]. here we ex-
tend this construction to the case of su (nc) group with
arbitrary nc. in the case of softly broken supersymme-
try it is found that induced charge matching conditions
require that baryon symmetry is unbroken in the global
vacuum.

the paper is organized as follows. in section ii we re-
capitulate the notion of induced charge matching. we
consider the qcd case and discuss the role of the wess
zumino term there.
in section iii we study induced
charge matching in sqcd with quantum modied mod-
uli space, analyze its topology and construct the ana-
logue of the wesszumino term in this model. the case
of softly broken supersymmetry is considered in section
iv. in section v we present our conclusions. appendix
a is devoted to the details of the topological analysis of
the quantum moduli space and in appendix b we show
that the wesszumino term of sqcd is unambiguous in
quantum theory.

ii. induced charge matching

to begin with, let us consider qcd with nc colors
and nf massless fermion avors. let a and a, a, a =
1, . . . , nf , denote left-handed quarks and anti-quarks, re-
spectively. this theory exhibits the global su (nf )l 

1

su (nf )r symmetry and non-anomalous baryon symme-
try,   ei,   ei . to probe the theory,
one introduces time-independent background scalar elds
ma

b (x) of the following form,

ma

b (x) = m0u a

b (x) ,

(1)

where m0 is a constant and u a
at each point x.

b (x) is an su (nf ) matrix

let these elds interact with quarks and anti-quarks,

lint = ama

b b + h.c.

(2)

in what follows we restrict the form of the background
elds by requiring that u (x) tends to a constant at spa-
tial innity. one can always make this constant equal to
unity, u (x)  1 as |x|  , by making use of a global
su (nf ) rotation.

the baryonic current is conserved and obtains non-
vanishing vacuum expectation value in the presence of
the background scalar elds. to the leading order in mo-
menta, the one-loop result for the induced current is [7]

hj

bi =

nc
242

 tr(cid:0)u u u u u u (cid:1) .

(3)

it follows from this expression that the baryonic charge
induced in vacuum is proportional to the topological
number of the background,

hbi = ncn [u ] ,

(4)

where

n [u ] =

1

242 z d3x ijk tr(cid:0)u iu u ju u ku (cid:1) . (5)

this topological property is the basis of the theorem
proven in ref. [4] that states that eq. (4) does not get
renormalized in the full quantum theory provided the ex-
pansion in momenta of the background elds is valid. it
is worth noting also, that higher derivative terms omitted
in eq. (3) do not contribute to hbi.

more generally, one does not necessarily introduce
masses to all quarks, and considers instead background
elds interacting only with some of the avors. the only
requirement is that all fermions coupled to the back-
ground elds become massive due to this interaction. in-
stead of the baryon number one may study generators
of other non-anomalous global symmetries which remain
unbroken in the presence of the background elds.

the non-renormalization theorem implies that the in-
duced charges should match in the microscopic and eec-
tive theories. these matching conditions are analogous,
but generally inequivalent, to the t hooft conditions.

let us see how induced charges match in qcd with
nf  3. following ref. [3] let us consider a general case
when a mass term (2) is added to the rst n0 quark a-
vors. there are two independent generators of the origi-
nal su (nf )l  su (nf )r  u (1)b symmetry group that

2

remain unbroken in the presence of the background elds
and act non-trivially on the rst n0 quark avors. the
rst one is a generator of a baryon symmetry and the sec-
ond one transforms rst n0 avors in the same way as
baryon symmetry and acts trivially on the other quarks.
as all fundamental fermions that couple to the back-
ground scalar eld acquire masses due to this interaction,
the derivative expansion is justied. hence, for slowly
varying m(x) one has

hqii = ncn [u ]

(6)

for the induced charges hqii corresponding to the above
two generators.

the low energy dynamics of qcd is described in terms
of su (nf )-valued sigma-model eld v (x). the interac-
tion with the background eld m(x) induces a potential
term into the low-energy eective lagrangian,

le = tr(cid:0)mv + v m(cid:1) .

for slowly varying m(x), the eective potential is mini-
mized at

v (x) =(cid:18) u (x) 0

1(cid:19) .

0

(7)

as we will see shortly, the induced charge matching con-
ditions are satised provided the wesszumino term [8]
is added in the eective action. this term cannot be
written as a four-dimensional integral of a su (nf )l 
su (nf )r-invariant non-singular function and is dened
as follows [9]. a eld conguration v (x) of nite en-
ergy denes a map s4  su (nf ) from compactied
spacetime to the space of vacua (moduli space). since
4(su (nf )) = 0, the image of this map is a boundary
of a ve-dimensional submanifold 5 in su (nf ). the
wesszumino term is the integral over this surface,

(8)

qcd =

d 

inc

2402 z5

 tr(cid:0)v 1v v 1v v 1v v 1v v 1v(cid:1) .

this expression is invariant under small deformations
of 5 because the integrand is a closed ve-form. the
discrete ambiguity in the denition of qcd is related
to non-zero homotopy group 5(su (nf )). however,
this ambiguity is irrelevant in quantum theory, because
eiqcd is well-dened. the contribution of the wess
zumino term to all global currents except for baryonic
one can be obtained by making use of the conventional
noether procedure and reads [9]

lv 1v v 1v v 1v

ja =

1

482

 tr(cid:0)t a

+t a

rv v 1v v 1v v 1(cid:1) ,

(9)

l and t a

where t a
r are su (nf )l and su (nf )r compo-
nents of a generator of a symmetry transformation. com-
paring eq. (9) with the formulae (6) and (5) for the in-
duced charges and taking into account the vacuum value

(7) of the eld v (x), one checks that induced charges
match for the unbroken generator of the avor group
su (nf )l  su (nf )r. the expression for the induced
baryonic current can be obtained by the formal substitu-
tion t a
l,r  1 in eq. (9), see ref. [9] for details. again,
due to eq. (7) induced baryonic charges match in the
fundamental and eective theories. we conclude that in-
duced charges match in qcd due to the presence of the
wesszumino term.

charge in the fundamental theory proceeds as in sect.
2, and we again obtain

hbi = ncn [u ] .

(13)

we now turn to eective low energy theory. for slowly
varying m(x) the interaction (12) translates into the ad-
ditional term tr mm in the eective superpotential (11).
as a result, the ground state is described by the following
x-dependent expectation values2 of mesons and baryons,

iii. wesszumino term in sqcd

let us turn now to the case of sqcd with nf = nc =
n . this theory exhibits quantum deformation of the
moduli space [5]. namely, the space of vacua of the mi-
croscopic theory is described by the set of holomorphic
gauge invariants constructed out of quarks qa and anti-
quarks qb. these invariants are mesons,

m a

b = qa qb

and (anti)-baryons

m (x) = 2u 1(x) ,
b = b = 0 .

(14)

one can explicitly check that no baryonic charge is in-
duced due to superpotential interaction in the eective
theory, as opposed to the supersymmetric models consid-
ered in refs. [3,4]. so, the wesszumino term is needed
in complete analogy to the qcd case.

the wesszumino term has been already constructed
in that theory one
in the case of su (2) group [6].
combines mesons and baryons into a single 4  4 anti-
symmetric matrix,

b = a1..an qa1..qan ,

b = 

b1..bn qb1

.. qbn

subject to the constraint

detm  b b = 2n ,

(10)

where  is the infrared scale of the theory. the r.h.s of
eq. (10) is of purely quantum origin and indicates the
dierence between the topologies of the quantum and
classical spaces of vacua.

in the low-energy theory of mesons and (anti-)baryons
the constraint (10) can be presented as an eective su-
perpotential

w = a(detm  b b  2n ) ,

(11)

where a is the lagrange multiplier supereld.

let us probe this theory by adding the scalar back-
p(x) with the same properties as above,

ground eld mq
i.e., by introducing the term

b
a(x) qbqa
m

(12)

into the superpotential of the fundamental theory. we
add the mass terms to all quark avors to avoid the
b
a(x),
run-away vacuum. then for the general matrix u
the external elds are neutral only under the baryon
symmetry1. the calculation of the induced baryonic

(15)

in terms of this matrix, the wesszumino term can be
written as follows3,

(16)

su(2) =

1

2402 imz5

d 

 tr(cid:0)v 1v v 1v v 1v v 1v v 1v(cid:1) .

in fact, this equation denes only the bosonic part of
the wesszumino action. however, it is sucient for our
purposes, since it is this part that is relevant for charge
matching. the wesszumino term (16) is written in the
holomorphic form, see ref. [10] for a discussion of why
this is possible.

as pointed out in ref. [6], the generalization of eq. (16)
to the case of sp (n ) group is straightforward. so, let us
consider su (n ) gauge group at n  3.

in order that the wesszumino term could be con-
structed, the fourth homotopy group of the quantum
moduli space q determined by eq. (10) should be trivial,
4(q) = 0. moreover, if 5(q) is non-trivial, the value of
the wesszumino functional  on its generators should
be equal to 2n, n  z, so that ei is well-dened in
quantum theory.

1in section iv we discuss a special case where additional
unbroken global symmetries are present.

2hereafter we use the same notations for superelds and
their scalar components.
3note that the matrix v is non-degenerate due to the con-
straint (10).

3

in appendix a it is shown that

q   ( (su (n ))) .

(17)

here by  we denote homotopic equivalence and (x )
is a suspension of the manifold x (see, e.g., ref. [11] for
denitions and notations). the generalized freidental
theorem ( [11], p.79) states that q+1 ( (x )) = q (x )
for q  2n  2, provided i(x ) = 0 for i < n. in par-
ticular, eq. (17) implies that 1(q) = 2(q) = 3(q) =
4(q) = 0 and 5(q) = z.

therefore, in the case of su (nc) sqcd with nf = nc,
the wesszumino term can be constructed as a ve-
dimensional integral, in similarity to the qcd case. an-
other outcome of our calculation is that the triviality of
the groups 2(q) and 3(q) implies that neither vortices
nor topological solitons exist in this theory.

the explicit expression generalizing eq. (16) is

the su (n ) sqcd with quantum modied moduli space
and that induced charge matching conditions are satised
in this theory when the term (18) is taken into account.

iv. softly broken sqcd

finally, let us discuss induced charge matching in the
model with the soft supersymmetry breaking mass term

vsof t = 2

q(|q|2 + | q|2)

(20)

added to the potential of the microscopic theory. it has
been suggested in ref. [12] that, at least at q  , the
eective theory is described both by the constraint (10)
and by the the soft terms

vef f =

2
2n 2 (|b|2 + | b|2) +

m

(21)

sqcd =

1

d detm  b  b

1224n imz5
 tr(cid:0)m 1m m 1m m 1m(cid:1) .

(18)

it is straightforward to check that eq. (18) indeed repro-
duces eq. (16) at n = 2.

it is shown in the appendix b that sqcd = 2 when
5 is a generator of 5(q) and consequently the wess
zumino term (18) is unambiguous in quantum theory. at
rst sight sqcd appears singular at the points where
detm = 0. however, this is not the case. indeed, due to
the constraint (10) one has b, b 6= 0 at these points, and
the integrand in the r.h.s. of eq. (18) can be rewritten
in the following way,

1
2

(cid:18)  b

b

tr(cid:0)m m 1 detm
 m (cid:0)m 1 detm(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:19) .

this expression is explicitly non-singular when detm = 0
because m 1 detm can be dened there by making use
of the identity m 1 detm = m t , where m is a matrix
composed of the minors of the matrix m .

let us check that the wesszumino term (18) properly
reproduces the induced baryonic charge. contrary to the
qcd case, one can straightforwardly obtain the contri-
bution of the wesszumino term to the baryonic current
by making use of the conventional noether procedure,

j
b =

n

4824n detm 2  
 tr(cid:0) m m 1m m 1m m 1(cid:1) + h.c.

then, substituting the vacuum expectation value of the
meson elds (14) one obtains the same value of the in-
duced baryonic charge as in the microscopic theory, eq.
(13).

(19)

to summarize, the above analysis shows that eq. (18)
is a well-dened expression for the wesszumino term in

4

then, up to avor rotations, there are two candidates
for global minima of this potential. in the rst one the
baryon symmetry is unbroken, b = b = 0 , m a
= 2  1,
b
while in the second one the avor symmetries are unbro-
ken, b =  b = n , m a
= 0. which of these points is
b
the global vacuum depends on the ratio 2
that has not
b
2
m
been calculated.
indeed, the baryon number violating
stationary point is always a stable minimum, while the
stationary point with b = b = 0 is unstable if 2
< 1
b
2
m
and is a global vacuum if 2
b
2
m

> n
2 .

let us now introduce the space-dependent mass term
(12). the induced baryonic charge as calculated in the
microscopic theory is the same as in the supersymmetric
case. in the low-energy theory there are again two can-
didates for the global minimum of the eective potential.
the rst one corresponds to the stationary point with
unbroken baryon symmetry and is the same as in the su-
persymmetric case (see eq. (14)). in the second station-
ary point the baryon symmetry is broken, b =  b = n
, m a
= 0. the baryonic current induced in the rst can-
b
didate vacuum is given by eq. (19) and properly repro-
duces the induced charge as calculated in the microscopic
theory. in the second extremum the baryon symmetry is
spontaneously broken and the baryon charge matching
condition cannot be straightforwardly applied. conse-
quently, the matching condition for the baryonic charge
does not enable one to conclude which of the two extrema
is the global vacuum.

however, for some special choices of the background
scalar eld (1), additional matching conditions arise.
namely, let us take the matrix u a
(x) in the following
b
form,

u (x) =(cid:18) u (x) 0

1 (cid:19) ,

0

where u (x) is n0  n0 unitary matrix.
in analogy to
the qcd case, background elds of this form respect

two independent symmetries acting non-trivially on the
rst n0 avors. the rst one is the baryon symmetry.
the second one is a vectorial subgroup of the original
su (nf )l  su (nf )r avor group; its generator is

t f = diag(cid:18)1, . . . , 1, 

n0

nf  n0

, . . . , 

n0

nf  n0(cid:19) .

in the microscopic theory both induced charges are equal
to ncn [ u ].

in the eective theory the second symmetry remains
unbroken in both minima. the corresponding avor cur-
rent determined by the wesszumino term (18) is

j =

n

424n detm 2  b  b tr(cid:0)t f m m 1(cid:1)

+h.c.

(22)

therefore, this current is zero in both stationary points.
nevertheless,
in the minimum with unbroken baryon
symmetry (and in the supersymmetric case as well) the
charge matching condition corresponding to the addi-
tional symmetry is satised. the point is that fermionic
components of mesons m
are charged under this sym-
metry provided that one of the indices (i, j) is less than
or equal to n0, while another is larger than n0. in the
rst candidate vacuum mesons obtain non-zero vacuum
expectation values (14) which generate spatially depen-
dent masses for m

through the term a detm in the eective superpotential.
then the calculation of the induced charge proceeds in
the same way as in the microscopic theory and one can
straightforwardly check that the resulting charge is again
ncn [ u].

on the contrary, in the minimum with broken baryon
symmetry one has m a
(x) = 0 and the relevant fermions
b
remain massless. consequently, charge matching condi-
tions are not satised in this minimum, that strongly
suggests that the baryon symmetry is unbroken in the
global vacuum 4 and that 2

2
4it is worth noting, however, that in the whole range

satised. for

baryon symmetry and for 
< 1 there appears an additional

local minimum where both baryon and avor symmetries are
broken.

v. conclusions

we have considered matching of induced charges in
su (n ) sqcd with quantum modied moduli space. we
have found that matching conditions are satised pro-
vided an additional term similar to the wesszumino
term in the non-supersymmetric qcd is added. our cal-
culation has shown that, contrary to the qcd case, the
third homotopy group 3(q) of the vacuum space is triv-
ial. consequently, no topological solitons exist in sqcd.
another consequence of this fact is that in the super-
symmetric case, the baryonic current carried by spatially
inhomogeneous meson elds is not topological and can
be obtained by making use of the conventional noether
procedure. the second homotopy group 2(q) was found
to be also trivial, so there are no global vortices in this
theory either.

we have studied the case of softly broken supersym-
metry as well.
in similarity to the models considered
in refs. [3,4], induced charge matching conditions pro-
vide non-trivial information about the low-energy eec-
tive theory in this case. namely, they strongly disfa-
vor the existence of the global baryon number violat-
ing vacuum. as a consequence, we have obtained the
lower bound on the ratio of the soft baryonic and mesonic
masses.

appendix a. topology of the quantum

moduli space

in this appendix we present a proof of the homotopic
equivalence given by eq. (17). let us rst recall that
the suspension (x ) of the manifold x is the cylinder
x  [0, 1] where all points on the lower base x  0 are
identied and all points on the upper base x  1 are
identied as well. as an example, the suspension of the
d-dimensional sphere sd is the (d+1)-dimensional sphere
s(d+1). the latter observation is the basis of the gener-
alized freidental theorem (theorem about suspension),
which we refer to in the text.

in order to prove the homotopic equivalence (17), let
us consider new variables b1 and b2 instead of b, b such
that the quantum moduli space is determined by the fol-
lowing equation,

alent to sl(n, c). at b1 = n , eq. (23) denes
the surfaces homotopically equivalent to a point. conse-
quently, eq. (23) indeed denes the manifold homotopi-
cally equivalent to (sl(n, c)) if one restricts b1 to be-
long to the interval [n , n ]. finally, let us construct
a deformation retract of q1 onto its part determined by
b1  [n , n ].

let us take a point (m a

as shown in fig. 1 and dene the matrix m a

m (t) = t m (0) ,

and 1 is the (n  1)  (n  1) unit matrix. the existence
of such a deformation implies that q1  (sl(n, c)).

one can straightforwardly generalize these arguments
and show that q  (q1). the last remark to be made
for proving the relation (17) is that the su (n ) group is
homotopically equivalent to the sl(n, c) group.
