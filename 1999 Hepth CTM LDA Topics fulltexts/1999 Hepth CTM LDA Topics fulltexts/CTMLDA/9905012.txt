(82) dimensions fundamental scale low agreement gravity appears us large scales, would worthwhile study cases dimensions. going (much) past, one examine issue ination brane cosmology, question attracted recently much attention -. rst question whether ination triggered energy density bulk brane. spirit paper discuss brane ination restrict attention case. next issue deals initial conditions. stressed brane ination might require almost empty bulk, following condition bulkr(5) brane. study clearly shows domination brane bulk energy density need imposed local level, i.e. typical distance scale order 1 (5) . words, need impose weaker constraint bulkm 1 (5) < brane. (83) fact ensures bulk energy neighbourhood brane dominate conned energy. also consistent general constraint (21), condition brane < 4 (5), represents natural bound energy density localized brane. similarly, recent discussions  necessity untol- erably light inaton eld apply context non-conventional cosmological scenario. indeed, using relation (20) assuming natural bound 4 (5), obtain h 3 (5) m(5).
