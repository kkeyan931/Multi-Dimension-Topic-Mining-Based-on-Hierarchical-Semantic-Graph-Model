the local action of an su (2) gauge theory in general co-
variant abelian gauges and the associated equivariant brst
symmetry that guarantees the perturbative renormalizabil-
ity of the model are given.
i show that a global sl(2,r)
symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken by ghost-
antighost condensation at arbitrarily small coupling and leads
to propagators that are nite at euclidean momenta for all
elementary elds except the abelian photon. the gold-
stone states form a brst-quartet. the mechanism eliminates
the non-abelian infrared divergences in the perturbative high-
temperature expansion of the free energy.

the existence of a quark gluon plasma phase in which
quarks and gluons are weakly interacting degrees of free-
dom at temperatures t >
  is suggested by the renor-
malization group ow of the eective qcd coupling con-
stant and the analogy with the plasma phase of qed.
lattice simulations indicate that this phase transition is
rst order and for pure su (2) occurs at t 2
c  2.1 
string tension [1]. although qcd is asymptotically free,
the perturbative analysis of the high-temperature phase
is plagued by infrared (ir) divergences [2]. the best
one can presently achieve perturbatively at high tem-
peratures is a resummation of the infrared-safe contri-
butions [3]. the situation is somewhat embarrassing,
since one naively might hope that an asymptotically free
theory allows for an accurate perturbative description of
the high temperature phase. the ir-problem encoun-
tered in the perturbative high temperature expansion in
fact is part of the more general problem of dening a
non-abelian gauge-xed theory on a compact euclidean
space-time without boundaries, such as a hypertorus. it
was shown [4] that normalizable zero-modes of the ghosts
cause the partition function to vanish in conventional co-
variant gauges. an equivariant brst construction was
used to eliminate these ghost zero-modes associated with
global gauge invariance at the expense of a non-local
quartic ghost interaction.
it was seen that this inter-
action leads to ghost-antighost condensation at arbitrar-
ily small coupling [4,5]. subsequently, the equivariant
gauge-xing procedure was successfully used to reduce
the structure group of an su (2) lattice gauge theory
(lgt) to a physically equivalent abelian lgt with a
u (1) structure group [6]. the equivariant brst sym-
metry of the partially gauge-xed lgt was proven to be
valid also non-perturbatively and the associated quartic
ghost interaction leads to ghost-antighost condensation

in this case too. the starting point of this investigation
is a transcription of this partially gauge-xed su(2)-lgt
to the continuum using the equivariant brst algebra. a
partially gauge-xed lgt together with a corresponding
critical continuum model that are dened by the same
brst algebra is perhaps of some interest.

we will see that a certain sl(2,r) symmetry associated
with this gauge xing is spontaneously broken by ghost-
antighost condensation at arbitrarily small coupling in
the continuum model and leads to propagators that are
regular at euclidean momenta for all elds except the
abelian photon. the corresponding massless gold-
stone states form a brst-quartet and do not contribute
to physical quantities such as the free energy. screen-
ing masses in a certain sense thus arise naturally in an
su (2) gauge theory in covariant abelian gauges. they
cure the ir-problem of the perturbative sceleton expan-
sion for the free energy.

the critical continuum action of the lattice model [6] in
euclidean space is uniquely specied by the brst alge-
bra, the eld content and power counting. decomposing
the non-abelian su(2) connection ~a = (w 1
 , a) in
terms of two real vector-bosons (or one complex one) and
a u(1)-connection a (the photon of the model), the
loop expansion is dened by the lagrangian,

l = linv. + lag + lagf .

and the ghost number  = [+, ]. this sl(2,r) sym-
metry is is also realized in the lattice regularized model
[6] and not anomalous. the conserved currents corre-
sponding to  are u(1)-invariant and brst, respec-
tively anti-brst exact,

(5)

note that lu(1) = linv. + lag is invariant under u (1)-
gauge transformations and under an on-shell brst sym-
metry s and anti-brst symmetry s, whose action on the

with an obvious extension to include matter elds. con-
trary to most other proposals for mass generation [7,8]
the brst algebra eq. (6) closes on-shell on the set of
u (1)-invariant functionals: on functionals that depend
only on w, a, c and the matter elds, s2 for instance ef-
fects an innitesimal u(1)-transformation with the pa-
rameter g
2 abcacb. the algebra eq. (6) thus denes
an equivariant cohomology and ensures the perturba-
tive renormalizability and unitarity [6,9] of the model.
note that the physical sector comprises states created
by composite operators of a, w and the matter elds in
the equivariant cohomology of s (or s). they are brst
closed and u (1)-invariant.

the corresponding equivariant (anti-) brst symme-
try of the lgt is valid also non-perturbatively and it was
shown [6] that expectation values of physical observables
of the u(1)-lgt are the same as those of the original
su (2)-lgt for any  > 0. note that formally setting
 = 0 and solving the constraint f a = 0 as in [10] is
not the same as taking the limit   0. the reason is
inherently non-perturbative and nicely exhibited by the
lattice calculation [6]: without the quartic ghost inter-
action, gribov copies of a conguration conspire to give
vanishing expectation values for all physical observables.
no matter how small, the quartic ghost interaction is
required to have a normalizable partition function and
expectation values of physical observables that are iden-
tical with those of the original su(2)-lgt.

lagf in eq. (1) has been added by hand to x the
remaining u (1) gauge invariance and dene the pertur-
bative series of the continuum model unambiguously. i
will assume a conventional covariant gauge-xing term,

lagf =

however, none of the following conclusions depend on the
gauge-xing of the abelian subgroup  they in particular
do not depend on .

the lagrangian eq. (1) also is invariant under a global

bosonic sl(2,r) symmetry generated by

i will argue that this global sl(2, r) symmetry of
the model is spontaneously broken to the noncompact
abelian subgroup generated by the ghost number . be-
cause the currents eq. (9) are (anti)-brst exact, a spon-
taneously broken sl(2,r) symmetry is accompanied by
a brst-quartet of massless goldstone states with ghost
numbers 2, 1,1 and 2. they are u(1)-invariant c  c,
c  w , c  w and c  c bound states. it is important to
note that brst quartets do not contribute to physical
quantities [11] such as the free energy2. the spontaneous
symmetry breaking in this sense is similar to a (dynami-
cal) higgs mechanism in the adjoint.

an order parameter for the spontaneous breaking of

the sl(2,r) symmetry is

to perturbatively investigate
consequences of
the
hcaabcbi 6= 0, the quartic ghost interaction in eq. (4)
is linearized using an auxiliary scalar eld (x) of canon-
ical dimension two. adding the quadratic term

laux =

1
2g2 (  g2caabcb)2

(11)

to the lagrangian of eq. (1), the tree level quartic ghost
interaction vanishes at 2 =  and is then formally of
o(g4), proportional to the dierence z 2
z of the renor-
malization constants of the two couplings3.
we shall see that the perturbative expansion about a

non-trivial solution hi = v 6= 0 to the gap equation

is much better behaved in the infrared. note that
eq. (12) is u (1)-invariant and therefore does not depend
on the u (1) gauge-xing eq. (7). let us for the moment
assume that a unique non-trivial solution to eq. (12) ex-
ists in some gauge ; we return to this conjecture below.
the consequences for the ir-behavior of the model are
dramatic. dening the quantum part (x) of the auxil-
iary scalar  by

v

g2 =  hca(x)abcb(x)i(cid:12)(cid:12)<>=v ,

(12)

2this is analogous to the decoupling of the goldstone quar-
tets of the weak interaction in r gauges [11].
3the discrete symmetry ca  ca, ca  ca,    relat-
ing s and s also ensures that  only mixes with caabcb.

the momentum representation of the euclidean ghost
propagator at tree level becomes

(14)

feynmans parameterization of this propagator allows an
evaluation of loop integrals using dimensional regulariza-
tion that is only slightly more complicated than usual.
more importantly, the ghost propagator is regular at eu-
clidean momenta when v 6= 0.
its complex conjugate
poles at p2 = iv2 can furthermore not be interpreted
as due to asymptotic ghost states [12].
when v 6= 0, the w -boson is massless only at tree

fig. 1. the nite one-loop contribution to the w mass.

technically, the one-loop contribution is nite because
the integral in eq. (15) involves only the ab-part of
the ghost propagator eq. (14). since p2/(p4 + v2) =
v2/(p2(p4 + v2)) + 1/p2, the v-dependence of the
loop integral is ir- and uv-nite. the quadratic uv-
divergence of the 1/p2 subtraction at v = 0 is canceled
by the other, v-independent, quadratically divergent one-
loop contributions  (in dimensional regularization this
scale-invariant integral vanishes by itself). m2
w further-
more is positive due to the overall minus sign of the ghost
loop. the sign of m2
w is crucial, for it indicates that the
model is stable and (as far as the loop expansion is con-
cerned) does not develop tachyonic poles at euclidean p2
for v 6= 0. conceptually, the local mass term proportional
to  ab is nite due to the brst symmetry eq. (6),
which excludes a mass counter-term. the latter argu-
ment implies that contributions to m2
w are nite to all
orders of the loop expansion.

fig. 2. (v, p2) to order g0.

if the model is stable at v 6= 0, the 1pi 2-point function
(v, p2) of the scalar must not vanish at euclidean p2
either. to order g0, (p2) is given by the 1/g2 term
that arises from eq. (11) upon substitution of eq. (13)
and the one-(ghost)-loop contribution shown in fig.2.
since a non-trivial solution to the gap equation eq. (12)
relates 1/g2 to a loop integral of zeroth order in the cou-
pling, we may use eq. (12) to lowest order to obtain a
tree-level expression for (v, p2) of order g0. eval-
uating the loop integrals, one obtains the real, positive
and monotonic function

(p2  0)  /(162) to order g0 establishes the per-
turbative stability of a non-trivial solution to eq. (12)
and the fact that this solution is a minimum of the eec-
tive potential.

an expansion about a solution v 6= 0 to the gap equa-
tion thus has lowest order propagators that are regular
at euclidean momenta for all the elementary elds ex-
cept the photon a (if all the matter elds are massive).
the polarization of the photon vanishes at p2 = 0 due to
the u (1)-symmetry  regardless of the value of v. taking
into account that the massless goldstone quartet associ-
ated with this symmetry breaking decouples from phys-
ical quantities, the situation for v 6= 0 is thus rather
similar to qed with an unorthodox massive matter con-
tent (extending the notion of massive matter to include
ghosts and other unphysical elds). but the perturbative
expansion of the free energy of qed does not suer from
ir-divergences if all the matter elds are massive [2].
since all the loop integrals of the sceleton expansion of
the free energy are infrared nite at a non-trivial solution
to eq. (12), a perturbative evaluation of the free energy
of this asymptotically free model is feasible and becomes
accurate at high temperatures.

to complete the argument, we have to solve eq. (12)
for small coupling. to lowest order in the loop expansion,
the relation between the renormalized couplings g, , the
renormalization point  and an expectation value v 6= 0
implied by eq. (12) is

ln

v2
4 = 

162
g2 + 2 + o(g2) .

(17)

the anomalous dimension v of the expectation value is
simultaneously found to be

v = 

d ln zv
d ln 

=

g2
162 (2  0) + o(g4) ,

(18)

where 0 is the lowest order coecient of the -function
of this model (0 = (22  2nf )/3 with nf quark avors
in the fundamental representation as matter).
using the relation between , g2 and the asymptotic

scale parameter m s, we may rewrite eq. (17) as
(cid:19) + 2 + o(ln g, g2) ,

apart from an anomalous dimension, the non-trivial so-
lution v at suciently small coupling is thus propor-
tional to the physical scale 2
in the particular gauge
 = 0/2. the anomalous dimension v in eq. (18) is
furthermore of order g4 at  = 0/2. the terms of order
ln g in eq. (19) thus also vanish in this particular gauge
and higher order corrections to the asymptotic value of

v at small g2 are analytic in g2. in the gauge  = 0/2,
one can expand the model about

v2 =

e24

m s(1 + o(g2))

(20)

and determine the o(g2) corrections in eq. (20) order by
order in the loop expansion of the gap equation eq. (12).
at  = 0/2 the lowest order solution eq. (20) remains
accurate to order g2 at any nite order of the loop ex-
pansion. this does not imply that other gauges are any
less physical, but it does single out  = 0/2 as the
gauge in which a perturbative evaluation of the gap equa-
tion eq. (12) is consistent at suciently small values of
g2. (in qed the hydrogen spectrum to lowest order is
most readily obtained in coulomb gauge, although it ev-
idently does not depend on the chosen gauge.
in the
present case asymptotic freedom allows us to determine
an optimal gauge for solving the gap equation.)

at the one-loop level, eq. (12) has a unique non-
trivial solution in any gauge  6= 0 and we know from
 of eq. (16) that it corresponds to a minimum of the
one-loop action. in the limit   0 at nite coupling,
the non-trivial one-loop solution eq. (17) coincides with
the trivial one. on the other hand, some of the couplings
in the non-linear gauge-xing lag become large in this
limit, invalidating the perturbative analysis.
to gain some insight into the highly singular behavior
of the model when   0, i calculated the divergent part
of the w self-energy to one loop. the corresponding
anomalous dimensions w and  of the vector boson
and the gauge parameter are

(21)

gauge dependent interaction terms proportional to g/
at one loop thus lead to a term of order g2/2 in the lon-
gitudinal part of the w self-energy only. the transverse
part of the w self-energy is regular in the limit   0.
taking  to vanish thus is rather tricky: eq. (21) im-
plies that the longitudinal part of the w -propagator at
one loop is proportional to 3g2p2 ln(p2) at large momenta
and no longer vanishes in this limit. higher order loop
corrections similarly contribute to the longitudinal prop-
agator as   0.  does not depend on the gauge pa-
rameter  at one loop, due to an abelian ward identity
that also gives the qed-like relation [10] za = z 2
g = z
between the renormalization constants of the photon, of
the coupling g and of the gauge parameter .

the anomalous dimension of the gauge parameter  at
suciently small g2 is negative for positive values of 
when 0 < 6 + 23. with  < 0, the eective gauge
parameter tends to decrease at higher renormalization
scales  and direct integration of eq. (21) gives a van-
ishing  at a nite value of the coupling g2. as already

noted above, the loop expansion, however, is valid only
if g2  1 and g2/  1. but eq. (21) does show that
there is no nite uv xed point for the gauge parameter
and that  eectively vanishes at least as fast as g2 as
   for any gauge at nite g2. eq. (20) neverthe-
less is the asymptotic solution to eq. (12) in the sense
that it is valid at arbitrary small coupling if one chooses
the gauge at that coupling to be (g) = 0/2. this
is compatible with the asymptotic vanishing of the ef-
fective gauge parameter only if higher order corrections
lead to an anomalous dimension v that eectively re-
mains of order g4 even as g, (g)  0. since the gauge
sector becomes strongly coupled when g2/(g) is o(1),
and the loop expansion does not give the correct behavior
of eq. (18) in this limit, this is at least conceivable.

let me nally say that the non-trivial solution to the
gap equation apparently persists to arbitrarily high tem-
peratures. the (unique) non-trivial solution at t = 0
is a consequence of the scale anomaly [5] and the gold-
stone quartet of the spontaneously broken sl(2,r) sym-
metry does not contribute to the free energy. the renor-
malization point dependence of eq. (17) and the asso-
ciated uv-divergence of the loop integral are an indica-
tion of this. the character of the solution to eq. (12)
does, however, change dramatically with temperature
[13]. at low temperatures v(t ) deviates only marginally
from eq. (20), whereas at high temperatures v(t  ) 
t 2/ ln2 (t /).
