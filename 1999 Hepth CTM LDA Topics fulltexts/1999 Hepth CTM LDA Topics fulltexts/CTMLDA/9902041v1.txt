abstract
we construct a topological eld theory which, on the one hand, general-
izes bf theories in that there is non-trivial coupling to topological matter
elds; and, on the other, generalizes the three-dimensional model of carlip
and gegenberg to arbitrary dimensional manifolds. like the three dimen-
sional model, the theory can be considered to describe a gravitational eld
interacting with topological matter. in particular, in two dimensions, the
model is that of gravity on a torus. in four dimensions, the model is shown
to admit constant curvature black hole solutions.

1 introduction

the considerable amount of progress made in recent years in quantum
gravity has in large part resulted from advances in (2+1)-dimensional general
relativity. in the absence of matter, the eld equations imply that spacetime
is locally at. consequently the theory has no propagating modes, and the
reduced phase space is nite dimensional, allowing one to fully quantize
the theory [1]. unfortunately, the addition of matter has the general eect
of destroying this exact solvability, introducing propagating modes which
render the phase space innite dimensional.

however there is a theory in which a class of matter elds in (2 + 1)
dimensions does not destroy solvability. referred to as bcea theory, it
minimally couples a pair of topological matter elds (one-forms ba and c a)
to gravity in such a way that the connection aa remains locally at [2], while
allowing the triad ea to have non-trivial structure. hence, gravitational
and matter degrees of freedom are inextricably mixed. in addition, the eld
equations admit constant curvature black hole solutions that are analogous
(but not identical) to the (2 + 1)-dimensional btz black hole [3]. in the
context of bcea theory, the role of inner and outer event horizons for the
(spinning) btz black hole are interchanged [4].

furthermore bcea theory has a supersymmetric generalization for which
one can show that this black hole solution is supersymmetric [5]. the su-
persymmetrized theory can be quantized, and it turns out that the partition
function is a topological invariant which in a sense contains both the sum
of the squares of the ray-singer analytic torsions and the casson invariant
of at so(3) bundles over the three dimensional spacetime manifold [2, 6].
in this paper we construct higher-dimensional versions of bcea theory,
which we call bqpa theories. the class of bqpa theories minimally couple
topological matter (i.e. matter which does not couple directly to a metric)
to gravity. the metric is a derived quantity which can have non-trivial
structure due to the presence of the matter elds. in particular, black holes
of constant negative curvature are solutions to the eld equations, with
the (negative) cosmological constant being a constant of integration. these
black holes are analogous (but not identical) to the class of topological black
holes recently considered in the literature [7, 8, 9].

the outline of the paper is as follows. in section 2, we briey review
the original 3d bcea theory. in sections 3 and 4 we develop the higher
dimensional generalization- bqpa theory. in section 5 we show how bqpa
theory may be considered as a theory of gravity interacting with (topolog-

1

ical) matter elds.
in section 6 we explicate the slightly distinct case of
the two dimensional theory, showing, in particular, that it can be consid-
ered as a theory of gravity on a torus, with the various topological matter
elds related to the complex geometry of the torus. in section 7 the four
dimensional theory is shown to admit cosmological solutions and in section
8 constant curvature black hole solutions are obtained. we close with some
some speculations and suggestions for further work.

2 bcea gravity

the bqpa theory is the generalization to n dimensions of a 3-d topo-
logical eld theory [2], which we have called bcea theory [3].
in this
section, we review bcea theory, highlighting those features useful in the
generalization to spacetimes with arbitrary dimension.

the action for bcea theory is

s[b, c, e, a] = 

1

2zm 3(cid:16)ei  fi[a] + bi  d(a)ci(cid:17) ,

(2.1)

where d(a) is the covariant derivative with respect to the so(3) (or so(2,1))
connection ai with curvature ra[a] given by

fi[a] := dai +

1
2

[a, a];

(2.2)

and ei, bi, c i are 1-form elds over m3 taking their values in the lie algebra
so(3), respectively so(2,1). in particular, a = aigi, with gi the generators
of the lie group:

[gi, gj] =

ijkgk,

(2.3)

1
2

where the indices i, j, ... = 0, 1, 2 are raised and lowered with respect to
the kronecker delta ij in the case of so(3), and the minkowski metric
ij = diagonal(1, +1, +1) in the case of so(2,1).
tions

the stationary points of s[b, c, e, a] are determined by the eld equa-

fi[a] = 0,
d(a)bi = 0,
d(a)ci = 0,
ijkbj  ck = 0.

1
2

2

d(a)ei +

(2.4)

it is because of the term in bj  ck in the last equation of motion, that the
triad ei is not, in general, compatible with the locally at spin-connection
ai. nevertheless, the equations of motion above determine a non-trivial
spacetime geometry on m 3: if we dene a one-form eld qi by the require-
ment

then the equation of motion for the ei can be written as

ijk (qj  ek  bj  ck) = 0,

where

dei +

1
2

ijkj  ek = 0,

i := ai + qi.

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

eq. (2.6) may be recognized as the condition that the frame-eld ei be
compatible with the (nonat) spin connection i.

we may thus interpret bcea theory as a model of (2+1)-dimensional
gravity with a triad ei and a connection i coupled to matter elds bi and
c i. the geometry is determined by the metric g = ijei
 in the case
where the gauge group is so(2,1), and with ij replaced by ij for so(3).

ej

the action functional s[b, c, e, a] is invariant under a twelve-parameter

group whose innitesimal generators are [2]

bi = d(a)i +

c i = d(a)i +

ei = d(a)i +
ai = d(a) i.

1
2
1
2
1
2

ijkbjk,

ijkcjk,

ijk (ejk + bjk + cjk) ,

(2.8)

this group may be recognized as i(iso(2,1)), where the notation ig denotes
the semi-direct product of the lie group g with its own lie algebra lg. like
the action for ordinary einstein gravity in three dimensions [10], the bcea
action can be obtained from a chern-simons functional, now for the gauge
group i(iso(2,1)).

although bcea theory has not been widely explored, a few of its prop-
erties are known. quantization of the theory has been discussed: one can
show [2] that the partition function is given by the sum of the squares of
the ray-singer torsions for each at connection a. black hole solutions of
various types were later obtained as solutions of the equations of motion

3

eq. (2.4) [3], including an analogue of the btz black hole [11]. although
the metric formally is the same as that of the btz metric, in bcea theory
the constants of integration have a dierent interpretation, and the black
hole thermodynamics is not of the bekenstein-hawking form, except in the
extremal case [3].

3 bqpa theory

we now generalize the bcea theory to n dimensions. the group in-
volved is the poincare group i g built from the n-dimensional lorentz group,
g = so(n  1, 1) (or the rotation group g = so(n)). if the generators of
g are gij, with i, j, ... = 0, 1, ..., (n  1) and tj generate translations, then
the set {gij, tk} generates i g:
2(cid:16)gjkl

i  gikl

j(cid:17) tl;

(gkjgil + gjlgki + gikglj + gilgjk) ;

[gij, tk] =

1

[gij, gkl] =

1
2
[ti, tj] = 0,

(3.1)

where gij := ij for so(n  1, 1) and gij = ij for so(n). the simplest way
to do this is via the action functional

s[b, q, p, a] = 

1

2zmn

p ij  fij[a] + d(a)bi  qi.

(3.2)

here, a := aijgij is an so(n-1,1) (or so(n)) connection. the curvature
f ij[a] = 1

 [a]dxdx is given by

2 f ij

f ij[a] = daij + ai

k  akj.

(3.3)

the 1-form elds b = biti and (n  2)form elds q = qiti take their
values in the translation subgroup of i so(n  1, 1) while the (n  2)form
elds p = pijgij take their values in the dual to the lie algebra generated
by the gij.

the exterior covariant derivatives with respect to the so(n  1, 1) con-

nection a of the translation and rotation type elds are, respectively,

d(a)bi = dbi + ai
d(a)pij = dpij + ai

j  bj,
k  pkj + aj

k  pik.

(3.4)

4

the stationary congurations are given by the classical equations of mo-

tion

f ij[a] = 0,
d(a)pij + b[j  qi] = 0,
d(a)bi = 0,
d(a)qi = 0.

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

from the analysis [12] it is straightforward to show that the symmetry
group of the theory is i(i so(n  1, 1)), i.e., the semi-direct product of
i so(n  1, 1) with its lie algebra. indeed, the innitesimal gauge trans-
formations which preserve the action eq. (3.2) are given by [12]

aij = d(a) ij,
qi = d(a)i  i
bi = d(a)i   i
pij = d(a)ij + [iqj]  [ibj] + 2[i

jqj,
jbj,

kpj]k.

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

the gauge parameters are form elds, with  ij =  ji and i both 0-form
elds, while i and ij = ji are (n  3)form elds. for n > 3 the gauge
symmetry is reducible.
we emphasize here that the action eq. (3.2) is a topological eld theory 
like chern-simons or bf theories there are no propogating modes  in other
words the (reduced) phase space is a nite dimensional manifold. also, as in
other topological eld theories, the dieomorphisms in the base manifold
mn are gauge transformations if the equations of motion are satised [12].

4 hamiltonian analysis

in the 3-d theory, the 1-form elds ei are the momenta canonically
conjugate to the connection components ai [2]. in the ashtekar formulation
of canonical general relativity theory, the spatial triads are conjugate to the
complex connections [13]. this motivated extracting gravitational physics
from the 3-d theory by identifying the ei with the spacetime triad. in the
following we generalize the hamiltonian analysis of the 3-d theory to n-
dimensions as a prelude to extracting gravitational physics. we generalize
the results obtained by bi [12] for n = 4.

locally the splitting of the manifold mn into space n1 and time ir
is accomplished by dening a volume element a1...an1 on n1 from the
permutation symbol 1...n on mn by

a1...an1 = 0a1...an1.

(4.1)

let t denote the time coordinate on ir and xa the spatial coordinates on
a patch on n1. then after integrating terms in 0aija and 0bi
a by parts
and using the notation f := 0f, daf i := af i + ai
jf j we get for the action
eq. (3.2)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

it can be shown that the poisson bracket algebra satised by the constraints
is the lie algebra of the group i(i so(n 1, 1)). see [12] for the case n = 4.
now the ija are lie algebra valued components of a spatial vector eld
density. the most natural way to extract a spatial frame-eld is

eia =

(1)n
[(n  2)!]2 a1...an2ap 0i

a1...an2.

(4.9)

6

the indices i, j, ... = 1, 2, ..., (n  1) denote components in the lie algebra
so(n  1) of the little group of so(n  1, 1). the eia are the densitized
spatial components of the contravariant frame-elds. note that eia is the
spatial hodge dual of the spatial components of the (n  2)form p 0i . we
will use this in the next section to construct lorentzian (or riemannian)
spacetime geometries. we note here that, only in the case n = 4, is it
equally natural to dene the densitized contravariant spatial triad by

 eia

5 the gravitational sector of bqpa theory

we saw in section 1 that the 3-d theory could be interpreted as a grav-
ity plus gauge eld theory by identifying the 1-form elds ei, i with the
spacetime geometry for any conguration in which the i are solutions of the
algebraic equations eq. (2.5). we shall generalize this to the ndimensional
case in this section.
in the case n > 3, the the eld p ij, corresponding to ei, is an (n 
2)form eld and, in general, we saw that a densitized spatial contravariant
frame-eld eia can be dened via eq. (4.9). now we dene in the case that
n  3 a contravariant vector frame-eld eia by
eia := e1/n2 eia,

(5.1)
in a region where e 6= 0, with e := det( eia). 1 in this region, eia has an
inverse which we denote by ei
a) = 1/ det(eia),
so that e = e1/n2.

a. it follows that e := det(ei

a riemannian metric hab on n1 is then given by the the inverse of

hab = ij ea

i eb
j .

(5.2)

the spacetime geometry is specied, in the adm formulation, by the spatial
adxa together with the lapse function n and shift vector
frame-eld ei = ei
n a on n1.

ds2 = n 2dt2 + (ij ei

aej

b )(dxa + n adt)(dxb + n bdt)

(5.3)

1for the case of n = 2, this construction fails. see the following section for the case

n = 2.

7

we dene the lapse and shift in terms of the p ij via

n =

n a =

e

(1)

[(n  2)!]2

aba1...an3

e

0a1...an3.

(5.4)

(5.5)

we have dened the adm components- the spatial metric, lapse function
and shift vector- from some of the components of the form p ij. we can
contruct a covariant frame-eld ei

 from the adm components via

a = ei
ei
a,

ei
0 = ei

an a,

e0
0 = n.

(5.6)

note that the components e0
one may use the gauge freedom to choose, say, e0
with 2

a are not determined from the adm variables.
a = 0. this is consistent

p ij = ij

k1...kn2ek1  ...  ekn2,

(5.7)

as long as the frame-eld satises e0
a1...an2 =
0. note that the n, n a are lagrange multipliers enforcing constraints in
both cases.

a = 0, and then it follows that p ij

in the case n = 4, the components p ij

ab are subject to an intriguing
interpretation. as we saw at the end of section 3- eq. (4.10)- we could
dene the densitized spatial frame eld with respect to the components p ij
ab
rather than the p 0i
a - the spatial components of the
so(3, 1) connection- are at. one can choose a gauge in which the aij
a are
self-(or anti-self-)dual, i.e.

ab . now on-shell the aij

 aij

a :=

1
2

ij

klakl

a = aij
a .

(5.8)

the corresponding components of the canonical momentum ija are self-
(anti- self-)dual. hence the densitized spatial frame elds satisfy

 eia =  eia.

(5.9)

hence, up to a gauge transformation, the two geometries dened by  e
and e are equivalent. this contruction is reminiscent of the formulation of
einstein gravity in terms of the ashtekar variables [13].

6 the two dimensional case

the two dimensional case is completely and explicitely solvable, though,
as we will see, somewhat degenerate. it is informative to display the solu-
tion for this case, since it illustrates many of salient features of the bqpa
theories.

we will show below that, in the simple case where the spacetime is two
dimensional, that the gauge group of the bqpa model is i so(2). we note
here that this case is rather singular compared with that of higher spacetime
dimension, where the gauge group is i(i so(n )).

in this case, pij = ijp is a 0-form. the indices i, j, ... = 0, 1. the
so(2)-connection is aij = ija. the qi and bi are respectively 0-and
1-form elds taking values in so(2).

since the group so(2) is abelian, the vanishing curvature condition gives,

in a coordinate patch u ,

a = d,

where  is a 0-form eld. now dene

q := q0 + iq1,
b := b0 + ib1.

(6.1)

(6.2)

then the equations of motion for qi and bi can be written respectively in
forms

dq = idq,

db = idb,

and have respective general solutions

q = qei,
b = ( b + d)ei,

(6.3)

(6.4)

where q := q0 +iq1 is an arbitrary complex constant, bi is a harmonic 1-form
eld and i is an arbitrary 0-form eld, with b = b0 + i b1 and similarly
 = 0 + i1.

the equations of motion for p ij reduce to

dp +

1
2

(q0b1  q1b0) = 0.

(6.5)

9

it is straightforward to show that in the hamiltonian analysis there are

two rst class constraints:

c := 2xp + i
:= xqi + i
ci

jbj
xqi,
jaxqj.

(6.6)

(6.7)

it follows that the poisson bracket algebra is precicely that of the lie algebra
of the two dimensional poincare group i so(2).

we now proceed to construct a spacetime geometry from the i so(2)
structure. we are of course dealing with the riemannian case. we restrict
to the case that the 2-manifold is closed and compact.
indeed, it is not
surprising that our i so(2) structure forces the torus topology onto the 2-
manifold, since the isometry group of the torus is precicely i so(2). the
form of eq. (6.5) suggests that dp is the imaginary part of the product
qb, where q is the complex conjugate of q. hence we dene
1

2
1

d p := 
= 

qb

2(cid:16)qibi + i

jqibj(cid:17) .

(6.8)

(6.9)

we see that d p is closed if b and q are closed under the exterior covariant
derivative da with respect to the at abelian connection a. furthermore,
the explicit dependence on the at connection a in b and q cancel in
qb. we construct b locally from the beltrami form dz + dz and the at
connection a = d as follows:

b = 2ei (dz + dz) .

(6.10)

note that b above is a non-trivial harmonic 1-form eld if z = 0. then

d p = q (dz + dz) .

this gives the usual form for the metric on 2-torus:

ds2 =| d p |2=| q |2| dz + dz |2 .

(6.11)

(6.12)

with  =constant, the metric is that of a at torus with teichmuller pa-
rameter  determined by  = (1 + i )/(1  i ). hence, p is the complex
coordinate in which the metric on the torus is isothermal.

10

7 cosmological solutions

we consider in this section spacetime solutions to the bqp a theory.
these are straightforward to obtain. for a spacetime of constant positive
curvature the solution corresponding to the metric

ds2 = dt2 + e2t/l(cid:16)dx2 + dy2 + dz2(cid:17) ,

is given by

pij = ijklek  el,

b0 = 4e2t/dt,
q0 = 0,

qi =

and i, j, ... = 1, 2, 3.

likewise the solution with constant negative curvature

ds2 = dz2 + e2z/(cid:16)dt2 + dx2 + dx2(cid:17) ,

is given by eq. (7.2) and eq. (7.5), but with

bi = 0

(7.11)

with indices i, j, ... = 0, 1, 2 raised and lowered by the 2 + 1-dimensional
minkowski metric ij = diagonal(1, +1, +1).
the solutions derived above illustrate an application of our approach
toward deriving gravity from topological eld theory in the simplest non-
trivial case, namely that of a spacetime with constant curvature.

11

8 black holes

the method for obtaining black hole solutions from spacetimes of con-
stant negative curvature are by now well-established [11, 7, 8]. since space-
times of constant negative curvature are solutions to the eld equations, we
can expect that black hole spacetimes are solutions to the eld equations as
well. we nd that this is indeed the case. we obtain the solution

using the prescription given in section (5) we nd that p ij = ijklek  el,

consistent with eq. (5.7), and so the metric is

ds2 = f dt 2 + f 1 dr2 + r2 (cid:16)d2 + sinh2() d2(cid:17),

(8.5)

where l = p3/||, with  the (negative) cosmological constant. the (, )

section of the metric (8.5) describes a compact space of genus g > 2 provided
 and  are appropriately identied. the section described by these coor-
dinates is that of a hyperbolic space or pseudosphere. this space becomes
compact upon identifying the opposite edges of a 4g-sided polygon (whose
sides are geodesics) centered at the origin  =  = 0 of the pseudosphere.
an octagon is the simplest such polygon, yielding a compact space of genus
g = 2 under these identications. further details of this construction can
be found in refs. [7, 8].

once these identications are made, the metric (8.5) describes the space-
time of a topological black hole of genus g > 2, with event horizon at r = l.
indeed, the above solution (8.18.4) is a (3 + 1) dimensional generalization
of the black hole solution obtained in bcea theory [3]. note that this is a
local solution which yields the metric (8.5).

9 summary

we have in this paper demonstrated how one can extend to higher di-
mensions the understanding of gravity derived from a topological eld theory
that has been previously given in (2 + 1) dimensions [2, 3]. in these bqpa
theories the connection is at and the metric is a derived quantity. however
the eld equations give rise to spacetime structures that are (at least) as
interesting as in (2 + 1) dimensions, as shown in the previous two sections.
we suggest that this latter feature  in conjunction with the nite number
of degrees of freedom these models have  make them attractive candidates
to study, particularly in terms of their quantum properties.

a number of interesting questions remain. what is the physical inter-
pretation of the remaining degrees of freedom p ij
a1...an2 ? in particular,
are there topological obstructions to the gauge p ij
a1...an2 = 0? are there
other interesting solutions to the theory which have a clear physical inter-
pretation? how does the coupling of other forms of matter aect the basic
physical properties and structure of bqpa theories? what resemblance do

13

these theories have to their (2 + 1) dimensional counterparts? these and
other topics remain the subjects of future investigation.
