we construct a two parameter family of 2-particle hamiltonians closed under the duality oper-
ation of interchanging the (relative) momentum and coordinate. both coordinate and momentum
dependence are elliptic, and the modulus of the momentum torus is a non-trivial function of the co-
ordinate. this model contains as limiting cases the standard ruijsenaars-calogero and toda family
of hamiltonians, which are at most elliptic in the coordinates, but not in the momenta.

introduction

the theory of (classical) integrable systems has been the subject of renewed interest following the realisation
that integrability is a crucial and characteristic property of non-perturbative eective actions (see, for example,
[1]). from this point of view the low-energy eective actions of yang-mills theories [2, 3] (they are non-trivial,
for example, in the presence of n = 2 supersymmetry) belong to universality classes represented by the simplest
nite-dimensional integrable models [4, 5, 6]. at the same time these yang-mills theories may be associated
with d-branes [7], which can be embedded in various target spaces. unfortunately the set of known integrable
models (the calogero-ruijsenaars and toda family1) does not include all of the universality classes arising from
the various brane constructions. the main gap is a putative double-elliptic integrable system, where both
coordinates and momenta take values in elliptic curves (complex tori), which should play a role in the description
of toric, k3 and calabi-yau target spaces. these will be associated with (compactied) six-dimensional yang-
mills theories.

it is the task of this paper to suggest what such a double-elliptic system can look like. we will discuss the
most straightforward construction based on a duality argument for the case of yang-mills gauge group su (2)
(2-particle integrable system). by itself our argument is not conclusive, for in this situation there is only one

where f (q) is a rational, trigonometric or an elliptic function. the momentum dependence of the conserved hamiltonians is now
trigonometric, with the calogero family arising as a limit of the ruijsenaars one.

the toda-chain family [11] (which warrants a special mention because it is associated with pure gauge n = 2 susy yang-mills

models in 4 dimensions [4, 12, 13]) is a special double-scaling limit of the elliptic calogero model [14].

each of these models, while being various limits of the elliptic ruijsenaars system, may further be embedded into the double-

elliptic system introduced in the present paper.

non-trivial hamiltonian and the multiparticle generalisation is needed. nonetheless, it provides an important
insight.

our paper rst reviews duality in the context of integrable systems. using this, section three constructs a
hamiltonian dual to the (elliptic) calogero model that is elliptic in the momentum. the resulting rational-
elliptic model is investigated with comparison made both to a direct solution of the elliptic calogero model
and that resulting from use of the projection method of olshanetsky and perelomov. an interesting feature
of our model is the appearance of dressed elliptic curves. section four simply states the result for the dual of
the (elliptic) ruijsenaars model, our trigonometric-elliptic model, while section ve details the construction
of the wholly new elliptic-elliptic model. we show here how the ruijsenaars-calogero and toda families arise
as limits of our model. some comments are also made on the ansatz involved in the construction of our model.
we end with a brief conclusion.

2 duality of integrable systems

integrable systems may be introduced and solved in a variety of ways. some of these include

1. the projection method [15], where solvable and often trivial dynamics on a given space look non-trivial

after dimensional reduction or projection to a lower dimensional space.

2. a full list of hamiltonians in involution may be given.

3. the system is exhibited in the lax form (possibly with spectral parameter) and r-matrices given [16],
showing the poisson commutativity of the powers of the traces.
in eld theory applications the lax
representation may be deduced either from (possibly quantum) group theory, or from the dynamics of
scalars  describing the shape of branes embedding [7]  in higher-dimensional susy yang-mills models.
the latter is essentially the dkn-hitchin approach [17, 18].

4. generalized wdvv equations [19, 20, 21, 22]. in the simplest cases they are related to hodge theory [23]

and, in more interesting situations, to non-trivial algebras of forms [20].

5. coordinate-momentum duality.

in what follows we shall introduce and exploit the last approach, which is quite a constructive procedure in the
case of su (2). connection will also be made with the projection method and, simply because of dimensionality,
the hamiltonian we construct together with the centre-of-mass fully describes the system. in this section we
will rst explain the general idea behind duality and then apply it in the two-particle context. we conclude
the section by relating this duality to an underlying dkn-hitchin-seiberg-witten structure.

2.1 duality: the general idea

the idea of duality here expresses a relationship between two completely integrable systems s1, s2 on a xed
symplectic manifold with given symplectic structure (m, ) and goes back to [24, 25]. we say the hamiltonian
systems are dual when the conserved quantities of s1 and s2 together form a coordinate system for m . consider
for example free particles, h (1)
i /k. for this system the free particles momenta are identical to the con-
served quantities or action variables. now consider the hamiltonian h (2)
i /k with conserved quantities
qi. together {pi, qi} form a coordinate system for phase space, and so the two sets of hamiltonians are dual.
duality then in this simplest example is a transformation which interchanges momenta and coordinates. for
more complicated interacting integrable systems nding dual hamiltonians is a nontrivial exercise. note that
this whole construction manifestly depends on the particular choice of conserved quantities. a clever choice
may result in the dual system arising by simply interchanging the momentum and coordinate dependence, as
in the free system.

k =pi pk

k =pi qk

some years ago ruijsenaars [24] observed such dualities between various members of the calogero-moser
and ruijsenaars families: the rational calogero and trigonometric ruijsenaars models were dual to themselves
while trigonometric calogero model was dual with the rational ruijsenaars system (see [25] for more examples).
these dualities were shown by starting with a lax pair l = l(p, q) and an auxillary diagonal matrix a = a(q).
when l was diagonalized the matrix a became the lax matrix for the dual hamiltonian, while l was a function
of the coordinates of the dual system. dual systems for a model possessing a lax representation are then related
to the eigenvalue motion of the lax matrix.

2

our approach to nding a dual system [25] is to make a canonical transformation which substitutes the
original set of poisson-commuting coordinates qi, {qi, qj} = 0, by another obvious set of the poisson-commuting
variables: the hamiltonians hi(~p, ~q) or, better, the action variables ai(~h) = ai(~p, ~q).
it will be clear below
that in practice really interesting transformations are a little more sophisticated: hi are identied with certain
functions of the new coordinates (these functions determine the ruijsenaars matrix a(q)), which  in the most
interesting cases  are just the same hamiltonians with the interactions switched-o. such free hamiltonians
are functions of momenta alone, the and dual coordinates substitute these momenta, just as one had for the
system of free particles.

the most interesting question for our purposes is: what are the duals of the elliptic calogero and ruijsenaars
systems ? since the elliptic calogero (ruijsenaars) is rational (trigonometric) in momenta and elliptic in the
coordinates, the dual will be elliptic in momenta and rational (trigonometric) in coordinates. having found such
a model the nal elliptization of the coordinate dependence is straightforward, providing us with the wanted
double-elliptic systems.

2.2 the 2-particle (su(2)) case

the calculations are especially simple in the case of su (2) which, in the center-of-mass frame, has only one
coordinate and one momentum. in this case the duality transformation can be described explicitly since the
equations of motion can be integrated in a straightforward way. technically, given two hamiltonian systems,
one with the momentum p, coordinate q and hamiltonian h(p, q) and another with the momentum p , coordinate
q and hamiltonian h(p, q) we may describe duality by the relation

h(p, q) = f (q),

h(p, q) = f (q).

here the functions f (q) and f (q) are such that

which expresses the fact we have a canonical transformation. this relation entails that

dp  dq = dp  dq,

f (q)

h(p, q)

p

= f (q)

h(p, q)

p

.

(1)

(2)

(3)

at this stage the functions f (q) and f (q) are arbitrary. however, when the hamiltonians depend on a
coupling constant g2 and are such that their free part can be separated and depends only on the momenta,2
the free hamiltonians provide a natural choice for these functions: f (q) = h0(q) and f (q) = h0(q) where

with such choice the duality equations become

h(p, q)(cid:12)(cid:12)g2=0 = h0(p),
h(p, q)(cid:12)(cid:12)g2=0 = h0(p ).

h0(q) = h(p, q),

h0(q) = h(p, q),

(4)

(5)

h(p, q)

p

h 

0(q) = h

0(q)

h(p, q)

.

free rational, trigonometric and elliptic hamiltonians are h0(p) = p2

2 , h0(p) = cosh p and h0(p) = cn(p|k)

respectively.

2 note, that this kind of duality relates the weak coupling regime for h(p, q) to the weak coupling regime for h(p, q). for

example, in the rational calogero case

h(p, q) =

h(p, q) =

we recall that in the brane picture the coupling constant g is related to the mass of adjoint hypermultiplet and thus remains
unchanged under t -duality transformations.

2.3 the dkn-hitchin-seiberg-witten structure

the main duality relation,

can be considered as dening a family of spectral curves q(p ), parameterised by a parameter (modulus) q. the
symplectic structure dp  dq = dp  dq, used in the formulation of duality, is then related to the generating
seiberg-witten 1-form ds = pdq, 3.

h0(q) = h(p, q)

(6)

from (6) it follows that

which together with (5) implies:

when compared with the hamiltonian equation for the original system,

0(q)t is proportional to the ordinary time-variable t. this is a usual feature of classical
in the su (2) case the spectral curve q(t) can be

where p is expressed through q/t and q from the hamiltonian equation q/t = h/p. in other words, the
spectral curve is essentially the solution of the equation of motion of integrable system, where the time t plays
the role of the spectral parameter and the energy e that of the modulus.

upon substituting

(this is because sn2q = 1  cn2q, dn2q = k2 + k2cn2q, k2 + k2 = 1 and cnq = h) we get for (12):

cn(q|k) = sn(q|k)dn(q|k) = p(1  h 2)(k2 + k2h 2),

p (cid:19)2
(cid:18) h

=

p2
q2 (1  h 2)(k2 + k2h 2).

now from the rst eqn.(12) p2 can be expressed through q and sn2(q|k) = 1  cn2(q|k) = 1  h 2 as

p2
q2 = 1

therefore h is an elliptic function of p , namely

pk2 + k22(q)!

in the limit g2 = 0, when the interaction is switched o, (q) = 1 and h(p, q) reduces to h0(p ) = cn(p|k),

as assumed in (12).

we have therefore obtained a dual formulation of the elliptic calogero model (in the simplest su (2) case). at
rst glance our dual hamiltonian looks somewhat unusual. in particular, the relevant elliptic curve is dressed:
it is described by an eective modulus

kef f =

=

k(q)

pk2 + k22(q)

p1  k2(1  2(q))

,

(19)

which diers from the bare one k in a q-dependent way. in fact kef f is nothing but the modulus of the
reduced calogero spectral curve [26], see eq.(36) below.

let us rewrite (17) in several equivalent forms. first, we may solve for (q) in terms of k and kef f ,

where e1, e2, e3 are the ramication points of the hyperelliptic representation of the dressed torus with

(x  ea) and

y 2 = (x  u)

ya=1
(x  ea).

the equivalence of these representations follows from the rational map

(28)

(29)

this allows another interpretation of formula (17): here x is the weierstrass function related to the elliptic
cosine in the left hand side of (17), while x is that related to the elliptic cosine in the right hand side of (17)
(y , y are the rst derivatives of the corresponding weierstrass functions). note that u in (28) is related to
the standard seiberg-witten modulus by a factor of 2g2: u = usw /2g2 and to the energy parameter e by
e = usw 2g2e3
modulus a below (in (35)).

. this rescaling factor is responsible for the unusual coecient p2g2 in our denition of the
the relation between ramication points in the dierent representations is easily obtained, since the rational
equivalence between the two sets of points, e1, e2, e3, u, x, x and e1, e2, e3,, x, x  implies the following

3.1 comment 1. elliptic solution of calogero model

according to the argument of 2.3 our hamiltonian (17) should be simply related to the solution q(t) of the
equations of motion of the calogero hamiltonian, which in the case of su (2) are immediately integrated to give

h cal(cid:18) q

this may be derived straightforwardly by dierentiating both sides and applying (13). note that the calogero
equation (46) and the family of calogero spectral curves are essentially independent of the value of coupling
constant g2: it can be absorbed into rescaling of moduli (like e) and the time-variables (like t).

in order to see that (47) is identical to (17) one needs to put e = q2 and make the rescaling p = h

0(q)t = qt.

another important remark about the calogero model is that its elliptic solution  and thus the su (2) dual
hamiltonian (17)  can be obtained by the projection method: the spectral curve q(p ) is embedded into its
jacobian (an abelian variety, i.e. a torus of complex dimension n = 2) by a simple algebraic equation

(q, p )  (q + p , q  p ) = 0

(51)

where q and p are just the two coordinates on the jacobian (hats appear because of the dierence in normal-
ization of arguments of theta and jacobi elliptic functions, see (23)). now the calogero spectral curve  and
consequently the relevant genus-two theta-function  has a very particular period matrix: the sum of all the
elements in every row is the same (independent of the number of a row),

n

tij = const

(52)

4 in the following sections we prove that not only the elliptic-rational (the dual of the elliptic calogero model) but also the
elliptic-trigonometric (the dual of the elliptic ruijsenaars model) and the elliptic-elliptic (our new double-elliptic) hamiltonians have
the same form (47), but the latter with the identications e = sinh2 q and e = sn2(q|k). thus they are also related to calogero
equation (46). however, the relevant symplectic structures  which are always given by dp  dq = h
0(q)dt  dq = dh0(q)  dt 
are no longer equivalent to de  dt (since e 6= h0(q), i.e. e is no longer associated with the proper hamiltonian).

in the case of n = 2 this means that the period matrix has t11 = t22. the corresponding theta-functions are
then easily represented in terms of genus-one theta-functions. for example:

where  = r + s and ef f = r  s and  = 1

2 (1  2).

we see that (after the appropriate  - and ef f -dependent rescaling of p ) the equation (q, p ) = 0 has
(34) and thus (17) as a solution. the dierent choices of sign in (34) correspond to dierent choices of theta-
characteristics in (51) and (53), and these are related by modular transformations. this result follows from the
work of [9]; see also [29, 28]5.

the projection method provides the most direct generalisation from su (2) to su (n ), i.e. to the n -particle
systems, described (in the center of mass) by g = n  1 independent coordinates and momenta. because of
(52) the genus-n theta function on the jacobian of the calogero spectral curve always decomposes into bilinear
combinations of genus-one and genus-g theta functions:

then denes n branches of the solution qi( ~p ), which generalises (17). as usual in seiberg-witten theory (see
eq.(10)) the dual momenta ~p may be associated with the rst g time-variables while the dual coordinates are
the moduli, parameterising the period matrix t (g) which characterises the covering of the bare elliptic curve.
~p ) may be considered as a generating function for the dual hamiltonians, with the
original coordinates qi playing the role of the spectral parameter (which carries an index i, labeling the sheet
of the n -sheet covering).

alternatively (n )(q,

the hamiltonians themselves are made from the genus-g theta functions (g)

theta-characteristics ei (as (17) in the case of su (2) is made from two genus-one theta-functions with half-
integer characteristics  which form an elliptic cosine). the seiberg-witten symplectic structure denes the

poisson bracket between ~p and t (g)
ef f such that the hamiltonians are poisson-commuting. commutativity is
implied by the claim [9, 29, 28] that for any n (and, at least, at a special value of the coupling constant g2)
in addition to the explicit decomposition (54) there is also an implicit (at todays level of knowledge) one into
elliptic (genus-one) theta (sigma)-functions:

~p ) 

n

yi=1

(cid:18)q  qi( ~p ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(56)

here qi( ~p|, t (g)
ef f ) are coordinates of the su (n ) calogero equations and so, for a given set of g times ~p , these
do poisson-commute. note that the non-trivial coecient of proportionality in (56) means the  -functions
(n )(q,
coecients (g)
commuting hamiltonians.

n (cid:17) also need not commute6 and only their ratios will. these ratios form the poisson-

~p ) need not commute at dierent values of the spectral parameter q.

in particular, the individual

t (g)

in order to get a double-elliptic system one needs to change the parameterisation of t (g) from rational to
elliptic, or, equivalently, to adequately deform the seiberg-witten symplectic structure. in section 5 below we
present such a deformation for the su (2) case.

ei (cid:16) ~p (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

4 elliptic ruijsenaars system

all of the above formulae are straightforwardly generalised from the calogero (rational-elliptic) system to the
ruijsenaars (trigonometric-elliptic) system. the only dierence ensuing is that the q-dependence of the dual
(elliptic-trigonometric) hamiltonian is now trigonometric rather than rational:

2(q) = 2

trig(q) = 1 

2g2

sinh2 q

(57)

for details on the geometry of the ruijsenaars spectral curves see [31]. rather than giving further details we
will proceed directly to a consideration of the double-elliptic model.

5 the double-elliptic system

5.1 solution of duality equations

in order to get a double-elliptic system one needs to exchange the rational q-dependence in (12) for elliptic an
one, and so we substitute 2
rat(q) by the obvious elliptic analogue 2
. moreover, now the
elliptic curves for q and q need not in general be the same, i.e. k 6= k.

ell(q) = 1  2g2

sn2(q|k)

instead of (12) the duality equations now become

cn(q|k) = h(p, q|k, k),
cn(q|k) = h(p, q|k, k),
= cn(q|k)

h(p, q|k, k)

p

h(p, q|k, k)

,

p

cn(q|k)

and the natural ansatz for the hamiltonian (suggested by (17)) is

h(p, q|k, k) = (q|k, k)  cn(cid:16)p (q|k, k) | (q|k, k)(cid:17) = cn(p|),
h(p, q|k, k) = (q|k, k)  cn(cid:16)p (q|k, k) | (q|k, k)(cid:17) = cn(p |).

(58)

(59)

for ease of expression we will suppress the dependence of , ,  on k and k in what follows using (q) for
(q|k, k) and (q) for (q|k, k) etc.

substituting these ansatz into (58) and making use of (13), the square of the nal eqn.(58) becomes

the rst two eqs.(58) together with (59) allow this to be simplied yielding

(cid:16)1  cn2(q|k)(cid:17)(cid:16)k2 + k2cn2(q|k)(cid:17) 2(q) 2(q)(cid:16)1  cn2(p |)(cid:17)(cid:16)2 + 2cn2(p |)(cid:17)

now there is cancellation between the third and fth terms of the left and right hand sides provided

=

k2

(q),

(q).

then, since 2  1  2, these may be reexpressed as

2(q) =

2(q) =

k22(q)

k2 + k22(q)

,

k2 2(q)

k2 + k2 2(q)

.

with these identications we now obtain from (61) that

this relation should hold for all values of the two independent variables q and q. these variables can be
separated provided the terms cn2(q|k)  cn2(q|k) on both sides cancel each other. this implies that

2(q)

k2 + k2 2(q)(cid:16)1  cn2(q|k)(cid:17)(cid:0) 2(q)  cn2(q|k)(cid:1) =
k2 + k22(q)(cid:0)1  cn2(q|k)(cid:1)(cid:16)(2(q)  cn2(q|k)(cid:17) .

2(q)

=

2(q) = k2 + k22(q),
2(q) = k2 + k2 2(q),

(60)

(61)

(65)

(66)

and

i.e.

(cid:16)1  cn2(q|k)(cid:17)(cid:0)2(q)  cn2(q|k)(cid:1) =(cid:0)1  cn2(q|k)(cid:1)(cid:16)(2(q)  cn2(q|k)(cid:17)
2(q)sn2(q|k) + cn2(q|k) = 2(q|k)sn2(q|k) + cn2(q|k) = 1  2g2 = const.

(67)
here we have represented the q and q-independent constant as 1  2g2 to introduce the coupling constant g2
in the conventional manner. thus we arrive at

,

(68)

2(q|k, k) = 2(q|k) = 1 

2g2

sn2(q|k)

2(q|k, k) = k2 + k22(q|k),
2(q|k, k) =
,

k22(q|k)

k2 + k22(q|k)

11

and nally the double-elliptic duality becomes

h(p, q|k, k) = cn(q|k) = (q|k)cn

h(p, q|k, k) = cn(q|k) = (q|k)cn

pqk2 + k22(q|k) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
pqk2 + k22(q|k) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

k(q|k)


 ,
qk2 + k22(q|k)

 .

qk2 + k22(q|k)

k(q|k)

(69)

(70)

these double-elliptic hamiltonians are our main new result. we shall now consider various limiting cases

arising from these, and discuss various other choices that can be made as an ansatz.

5.2 limiting cases

we now show that the double-elliptic hamiltonian

h dell(p, q|k, k)  (q|k)  cn(cid:18)pqk2 + k22(q|k)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2(q|k) = 1  2g2

sn2(q|k) ,

k(q|k)

k2+k22(q|k)(cid:19) ,

(71)

contains the entire ruijsenaars-calogero and toda family as its limiting cases, as desired. (of course we have
restricted ourselves to the su (2) members of this family in this paper.)

in order to convert the elliptic dependence of the momentum p into the trigonometric one, the corresponding
bare modulus k should vanish: k  0, k2 = 1  k2  1 (while k can be kept nite). then, since cn(x|k =
0) = cosh x,
(72)

h dell(p, q)  (q) cosh p = h ru(p, q)

with the same

2(q|k) = 1 

2g2

sn2(q|k)

.

(73)

thus we obtain the su (2) elliptic ruijsenaars hamiltonian.7 the trigonometric and rational ruijsenaars as
well as all of the calogero and toda systems are obtained through further limiting procedures in the standard
way.

the other limit k  0 (with k nite) gives (q|k)  trig(q) = 1  2g2

cosh q and

h dell(p, q)  trig(q)  cn(cid:18)pqk2 + k22

trig(q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ktrig (q)

pk2+k22

trig (q)(cid:19) = h ru(p, q).

this is the elliptic-trigonometric model, dual to the conventional elliptic ruijsenaars (i.e. the trigonometric-
elliptic) system. in the further limit of small q this degenerates into the elliptic-rational model with trig(q) 
rat(q) = 1 2g2
q2 , which is dual to the conventional elliptic calogero (i.e. the rational-elliptic) system, analysed

in some detail in section three above.

(74)

5.3 other double-elliptic ansatze

our approach has been based on choosing appropriate functions f (q) and f (q) and implementing duality.
other choices of functions associated with alternative free hamiltonians may be possible. instead of the duality
relations (58) one could consider those based on h0(p) = sn(p|k) instead of cn(p|k). these give

sn(q|k) = hs(p, q|k, k),
sn(q|k) = hs(p, q|k, k),
= sn(q|k)

hs(p, q|k, k)

p

hs(p, q|k, k)

p

sn(q|k)

,

(75)

7 indeed,

f 2(q) = c2(|k) (()  (q)) = c2(|k)(cid:18)

where q = 2 qe13 and 2g2 = sn2(|k).

e13

sn2(e13|k) 

e13

sn2(e13 q|k)(cid:19) =

c2(|k)e13

sn2(q|k) (cid:18)1 

sn2(|k)

sn2(q|k)(cid:19)

12

and now the natural ansatz is

hs(p, q|k, k) = s(q|k, k)  sn(cid:16)ps(q|k, k) | s(q|k, k)(cid:17) .

(76)

all of our calculations above may be repeated with little dierence, the only signicant one being that instead
of (13) one now uses

with this choice one gets somewhat simpler expressions for s and s:

sn(q|k) =p(1  sn2(q|k))(1  k2sn2(q|k)).

s = 1,

s(q|k, k) = ks(q|k),
2g2
s(q|k) = 1 

cn2(q|k)

and the nal hamiltonian is now

hs(p, q|k, k) = s(q|k)  sn(p|ks(q|k)).

(77)

(78)

(79)

although this hamiltonian is somewhat simpler than our earlier choice, the limits involved in obtaining the
ruijsenaars-calogero-toda reductions are somewhat more involved, and that is why we chose to present the
hamiltonian (71) rst.

one might further try other elliptic functions for h0(p). every solution we have obtained by making a
dierent ansatz has been related to our solution (71) via modular transformations of the four moduli k, k,
kef f =  and kef f = .

6 conclusion

in this paper we suggest that the 2-particle (su (2)) hamiltonian of the double-elliptic system is given by:

h(p, q|k, k) = (q|k)cn

k(q|k)

qk2 + k22(q|k)


 ,

(80)

(81)

pqk2 + k22(q|k) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2(q|k) = 1 

2g2

sn2(q|k)

as particular limits this model provides the elliptic ruijsenaars system (k  0) and its dual (k  0).

a non-trivial feature of our double-elliptic model is the dressing of the bare elliptic moduli k and k which
characterise the momentum and coordinate tori respectively.
in general the geometry of the double-elliptic
system involves two elliptic curves and two dressed jacobians (n  1-dimensional algebraic varieties) with
the period matrices  ,  , t (g)
ef f . the spectral parameters can be associated with the center-of-mass
momentum and coordinate or, equivalently, with theta-characteristics, as implicitly explained in [31]. the
multi-particle generalisation, introduction of spectral parameters, and the relationship between these models
and yang-mills in 6d, to double-loop algebras and conformal models, and to  -functions and their fermionic
representations will be discussed elsewhere.
