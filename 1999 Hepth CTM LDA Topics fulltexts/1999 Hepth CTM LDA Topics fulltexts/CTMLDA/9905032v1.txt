1. introduction

the dualities [1] [2] [3] between certain conformal eld theories and string theories on

anti-de sitter (ads) spaces with rr uxes have led to renewed interest in the description

of 2d conformal eld theories with rr backgrounds. a useful description of the latter
would allow one to go beyond the supergravity approximation and study 1/n and 1/g2n

corrections in the eld theory.

the description of rr backgrounds in the nsr formulation is a dicult problem. it is

not even known how to describe a condensate of rr vertex operators at the classical level
(for a recent attempt, see [4]). on the other hand, the classical description of ads5  s5
and ads3  s3 backgrounds with rr elds in the green-schwarz formalism is known [5].
the quantization of the gs string is more complicated than the quantization of the nsr

string. in at space, the gs string can be quantized in light-cone gauge, which breaks

manifest target space covariance. this is no longer possible on curved space like ads;

quantization in other gauges has been discussed in [6]

a third, more promising approach is to employ gs type variables for the nsr string,

which combines the covariance of the gs approach with the quantizability of the nsr

string. such variables exist in four [7] and six [8] dimensions. in ten dimensions variables
that preserve u (5)  so(10) super poincare invariance exist [9]. the six-dimensional
variables can be used to nd a description of superstrings on ads3  s3 with both rr and
ns background elds turned on [10]

the case of ads3  s3 with rr background is special because the theory can be
s-dualized to ads3  s3 with only ns elds turned on, which in turn can be described in
a straightforward way using wzw models. the resulting theory and the relation between

the space-time and world-sheet cfts were studied in [11], [12], [13]. we believe that the

ads5 and ads7 cfts described in this paper can be studied in a similar fashion.

in general, to construct a world-sheet description of a given string background one

needs to nd a 2d cft that describes that background, check it has the correct central

charge, and couple it to ghosts (or ghost-like variables depending on the approach). find-

ing exact conformal sigma models is not an easy problem. the models that have been

most extensively studied and that can be solved exactly are rational conformal eld the-

ories. many of those correspond to wzw theories (or their cosets). the corresponding

lagrangians are two-dimensional sigma models on group manifolds that include wz terms.

a priori the coecients in front of the kinetic and the wz term are unrelated, but for most

1

groups conformal invariance requires them to be proportional to each other. an exception
are the supergroups p sl(n|n), for which it has been shown recently that the theory is
conformal for arbitrary values of the two parameters [10], [14]. in fact, the description in
[10] of superstrings on ads3  s3 is based on a sigma model with target space the group
manifold p sl(2|2), coupled in a certain way to ghost elds. together with the physical
state condition this provides a complete world-sheet description of ads3  s3 background
with an arbitrary amount of rr and n s uxes.

in this paper we construct exact cfts with ads2d+1 backgrounds and compute their
central charges. as far as we know no previous examples of exact quantum cfts with

ads2d+1 target space (d > 1) were known, independently of whether rr background
elds are turned on or not. the exact cfts we construct all correspond to a novel type

of cosets of wzw models, and depend on one free parameter. standard cosets cannot be

used, because their target spaces are generically singular spaces of the form g/h where
h acts on g as g  h1gh. homogeneous spaces like adsd, on the other hand, are of
the form g/h where h acts from the left or right on g, and gauging such a subgroup in

wzw models is anomalous.

let us list some results:

1. for the purely bosonic case we claim that the sigma model

sads2d+1 =

k

2 z d2z (  + e2r r) +

1

2 z d2z (d  1)gr,

r = 1 . . . d (1.1)

is exactly conformal. it has ads2d+1 as target space, a non-zero b-eld and dilaton and
virasoro central charge:

c = (2d + 1) +

.

(1.2)

6

k  2d

the non-zero b-eld depends on a choice of complex structure on the boundary of ads2d+1
and therefore breaks the lorentz group from so(2d) to u (d). it is an interesting question

whether a supersymmetric version of this theory (see below) can be mapped (using a

combination of t - and s-dualities) to ads5 with only the rr ve-form turned on.

2. one can also consider the novel type of cosets for supergroups. the resulting sigma

models will contain anti-commuting (world-sheet scalar) variables . for example, for the
case of sl(n|n )/sl(n1)2 the resulting sigma model contains 2n 2 real anti-commuting
elds. the bosonic part of the sigma model has as metric ads2n1  ads2n1 with a
nonzero b-eld and dilaton. the prime on ads indicates that the metric is that of ads

2

but with a wrong sign for d2, ds2 = d2 + e2|dr|2. besides a kinetic term the anti-
commuting variables also have a fermionic b-eld. the precise meaning of this fermionic

b-eld depends on the way the sigma model is promoted to a full-edged string theory

(i.e. on the coupling to the ghost degrees of freedom). although this will not be discussed

in this paper, we suspect that there is a close relation between the fermionic b-eld and
rr background elds. the central charge of the sl(n|n )/sl(n  1)2 sigma model is
c = 2n 2 + 4n  2. for n = 3 we get a ten-dimensional space-time with c = 8.

another interesting example is sl(4|4)/sp (2)2. the corresponding homogeneous
superspace plays an important role in the construction of the action for the gs string
on ads5  s5. in our case we nd as space-time metric ads5  ads5 (we will comment
on the relation between ads5 and s5 later), and 32 anti-commuting world-sheet scalars.
furthermore, the central charge of this theory is c = 22. it is tempting to conjecture a
relation to the gs type of approach; however, our sigma model does not appear to have
an analogue of kappa symmetry1.

3. if we combine the examples given under 1 with their analytic continuations from 
to i (which corresponds to changing the geometry of ads to that of ads) we get bosonic
conformal sigma models with target space ads2d1+1  ads2d2+1. if d1 + d2 = 4 and the
two levels k1,2 of the two individual sigma models satisfy k12d1 = (k22d2) the central
charge is exactly equal to ten. by adding nsr type world-sheet fermions we can construct

a theory with n = 1 world-sheet superconformal invariance and central charge c = 15.

the number of unbroken target space supersymmetries equals (d1 + 1)(d2 + 1).

we will bosonize all models discussed above, thereby showing that they are exactly

solvable. we put the exact solvability between quotation marks because we expect to

encounter the same diculties that one meets when one tries to solve the noncompact

sl(2, r) wzw model using bosonization.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2 we describe the bosonic sigma

models with target space ads2d+1 and show that the corresponding background elds solve
(the lowest order in ) supergravity equations of motion. we will also discuss the global
and local symmetries of the cosets and comment on their holographic nature.

in section 3 we describe how such models can be obtained by means of a novel kind

of cosets of wzw models. this procedure was rst hinted in [15] [16] [17] in the search of

1 we thank m. bershadsky for discussions on the bosonization of current algebras for super-

groups and related questions.

3

w zw cosets that have a quadratic stress-tensor upon bosonisation. there is no known

geometric interpretation of this coset construction although we will attempt to formulate

it as geometrical as possible. we use the results of [18] in order to write the classical

lagrangian for such cosets. for the particular cases of sl(3)/sl(2) and sl(4)/sp (2)

we will see the emergence of the ads5 metric.

in section 4 we study nsr strings in these backgrounds. we describe the bosonization

including the nsr fermions and show that n = 1 world-sheet supersymmetry is preserved.

in section 5 we combine dierent nsr cosets to construct critical superstring back-

grounds with c = 10. we discuss the target space supersymmetries and comment on the
gso projection. the theory that resembles ads5  s5 preserves, quite intriguingly, 18 of
the 32 spacetime supersymmetries.

in section 6 we then turn to the generalization of the cosets to supergroups, and
in particular focus on the interesting case of sl(4|4)/sp (2)2. here we will face some
diculties which are most likely related to something which has become a standard lore

by now, namely that the only consistent iib string background with maximal susy (32-
supercharges) are given by at space or ads5  s5 (which has so(6) global symmetry,
n -units of rr ve form ux, and no other elds turned on)2. our backgrounds have

parity violating w z terms, a reduced global symmetry and therefore we do not expect to
be able to recover the usual ads5  s5 background, although we do get a cft on the
world-sheet whose target space metric is that of ads5.

we note that in the study of [10] there are two distinguished points in parameter

space: 1. the w zw point - when the parameters in front of the kinetic and wz terms are
related, leading to a p sl(2|2) current algebra symmetry, 2. when the w z term is absent.
the sigma models studied in this paper that are based on supergroups are analogues of

1. in the case considered in [10] the rr ux is zero at this point. it is not clear whether

this is true for the higher dimensional ads spaces. another interesting question that is

not discussed in this paper is whether it is in general possible to perturb away from the

wzw point, and if so, how.

finally, section 7 describes various open problems and directions for future research.

2 we thank a. strominger for pointing this out to us.

2. sigma models for ads2d+1

the simplest way to introduce the conformal eld theories presented in the introduc-

tion is to start with the well-known case of the sl(2, r) wzw model. the conformal

sigma model with ads3 target space is given by the wzw action for sl(2, r) in the
gauss parametrization and reads [19]

s =

k

2 z d2z (  + e2 ).

(2.1)

this theory has an sl2 current algebra. by introducing auxiliary elds ,  and rescaling
 the action can be rewritten as

s =

1

4 z d2z (  +   +    e2/+ 

2
+

gr)

(2.2)

where + = p2(k  2). this latter action describes a free eld  with some back-
ground charge and two free ,  systems, perturbed by the exactly marginal operator
v =  e2/+. the operator v is of the form s s, with s = e2/+ a dimension
(1, 0) operator known as the screening current. the contour integral of s is known as the

screening charge of the theory. the only holomorphic operators in the theory that com-

mute with h s are those constructed out of the sl2 currents. in addition, the correlation

functions of the theory can, after an appropriate number of screening charges have been in-

serted, be computed in the free eld approximation. in fact, the results obtained a decade

ago in the study of correlation functions for wzw models using the bosonisation technique

for conformal blocks produced results that were only valid for compact groups; note that
for su (2) what one does is the analytic continuation   i - this leads to the correct cor-
relators although the analytically continued sigma model doesnt describe anything close

to the su (2) wzw action, see for example [16] for the lagrangian approach.

to write down sigma models for ads2d+1, we simply take d copies of the single elds
, , , , and write down the same actions as above. the background charge in (2.2)
remains unchanged in order for the perturbations to be exactly marginal. however, if we
integrate out the elds ,  we now generate a nonzero background charge in (2.1), because
each pair of ,  contributes +2/+ to the background charge. thus, the appropriate
generalizations of (2.1) and (2.2) read

s =

k

2 z d2z (  + e2r r) +

1

2 z d2z (d  1)gr.

(2.3)

5

and

s =

1

4 z d2z (  + r r + rr  r re2/+ 

2
+

gr)

(2.4)

where r = 1, . . . d is summed over, and + =p2(k  2d).

in (2.3) we recognize a standard sigma model on ads2d+1 with nonzero b eld and

linear dilaton. it may appear somewhat surprising that these background elds solve (the
lowest order in ) supergravity equations of motion. we will now show that this is indeed
the case.

recall that supergravity equations of motion with only a nonzero metric, ns two-form

and dilaton read

rij + 1/4hiklhj

kl  2ij = 0

khkij  2khkij = 0.

for the metric we take the ads2d+1 metric

and for the two form

ds2 = d2 + e2(drdr)

b = e2dr  dr,

where r = 1, . . . , d. in addition, we take the linear dilaton from (2.3),

it is now straightforward to compute

 = (d  1).

rij = 2dgij

and since hr r = e2, we get

hklh

kl = 8dg,

hrklhr

kl = 8gr r .

furthermore, we nd that

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

rr  = (d  1)gr r ,

khkr r = 2(d  1)e2.

(2.12)

thus, both supergravity equations of motion are satised.

the one-loop correction to the central charge of the theory is given by

c = (2d + 1) + 3(4ii  42 + r +

12

hijkh ijk)

and we nd

c = (2d + 1) + 12 + o(2).

(2.13)

(2.14)

the usual coecient in front of (2.3) is (4)1, so that   (2k)1. we can also
compute the central charge to all orders using the free eld representation (2.4), with the

result

c = (2d + 1) +

6

k  2d

(2.15)

which agrees with (2.14) up to terms of order k2.

2.1. holographic aspects

if we approach the boundary of ads2d+1, the description in terms of free elds given

by (2.4) becomes very useful. both the string coupling and the perturbation become

very small near the boundary. on the other hand, it seems that the space-time theory is

strongly coupled near the boundary, because the string coupling goes to innity. however,

the growth of the strength of the string interactions has to compete against the rate at

which points at xed ,  separate near the boundary. the situation has some similarities

to the one discussed in [20]. to analyze these competing eects, it is better to pass to the

einstein frame. in the einstein frame, the metric on ads2d+1 becomes

ds2

e = e2/(2d1)(e2d2 + drdr).

(2.16)

because of the positive power of e in front of this expression, distances on the bound-

ary parametrized by r, r go to innity as  goes to innity, and therefore we expect

holographic behavior for large  as in [20].

a useful set of vertex operators in the theory is given by wave functions which are

solutions of the laplace equation on ads2d+1 that behave as a delta function near a given

boundary point. as in [12], [13] correlation functions of such operators will compute

correlation functions of the (unknown) theory living on the boundary.

7

2.2. reality conditions

so far we have not yet specied which reality conditions the elds satisfy. this depends

on the precise ads space we wish to consider. euclidean ads2d+1 is given by the equation

dxr=1

in the space with metric

(x2

r + y2

r ) + z2  w2 = 1

ds2 =

dxr=1

(dx2

r + dy2

r ) + dz2  dw2.

we parametrize solutions to (2.17) as follows

xr + iyr = re,

xr  iyr = re,

z + w = e + exr

r r,

z  w = e.

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

if we insert this into (2.18) we obtain the ads2d+1 metric in the form ds2 = d2 +
e2drdr. thus, to describe euclidean ads we require that r and r are each others

complex conjugate. other signature ads spaces are obtained by taking r and r real and

independent for certain r, or by taking them to be minus each others complex conjugate.

lorentzian signature ads has one pair of real independent , . all possible signature

ads spaces can be obtained this way, except s2d+1.

it is at present not clear to us whether there exists a generalization of the ads2d+1
sigma models to s2d+1 for d > 1. for d = 1, as we already mentioned, there is a close rela-

tion between the sl(2, r) wzw theory at negative level and the su (2) = s3 wzw theory

at positive level which in terms of the variables in (2.1) requires analytic continuation in .

perhaps a similar analytic continuation of ads2d+1 to negative level has an interpretation
as a cft on s2d+1. because we dont have full understanding in the simplest case of
sl(2, r)  su (2), but analytic continuation does give correct results, we will assume that
a similar procedure works for the ads2d+1  s2d+1 case as well. it would be interesting
to investigate this further.

8

2.3. global and local symmetries

the global symmetries of (2.3), ignoring the dilaton, are for d > 1 given by

 = c,

r = ar + brss,

r = ar + brss

(2.21)

with the parameters subject to the condition

brs + bsr + 2crs = 0.

(2.22)

the reality conditions on the parameters follow from those on the elds. the number of
global symmetries is equal to (d + 1)2. for euclidean ads2d+1 the group of global symme-
tries contains an obvious u (d) group of global symmetries. the full group is smaller than

the isometry group of ads2d+1 which is so(2d + 1, 1). the group of global symmetries is
broken by the presence of the ns two-form, whose eld strength in terms of the coordinates
(2.17) is proportional to h  (z  w)1d(z  w)  dxr  dyr.

for d = 1 the global symmetries of euclidean ads3 are sl(2, c), for lorentzian ads3

sl(2, r)  sl(2, r).

besides the global symmetries there are also holomorphic symmetries of ads2d+1, that

give rise to holomorphic currents. these currents are given by

jr(z) = e2r = r,

j0(z) =  + e2xr

rr =xr

rr  +

(2.23)

and remain holomorphic in the full quantum theory (via the second equality above). these

operators commute with the screening charges:

qr =z dzre 2

+



and also form the ope algebra:

jr(z)j0(w) = 2jr(z)
z  w

jr(z)jr (w) = 0,
j0(z)j0(w) = 2k

(z  w)2

(2.24)

(2.25)

in order to determine the complete chiral algebra one should nd all polynomials in the free

elds and their derivatives that commute with the screening charges. one such operator

is the stress-tensor:

t (z) = 

1
2

(xr

rr + ()2 +

2
+

2).

(2.26)

9

3. bosonic wzw cosets

such that the levels of the corresponding current algebras satisfy kg +cg

it was noticed in [15], [16], [17] that given a group g and a subgroup h = h1h2...,
v = ...,
one can attempt to dene some sort of coset theory, by getting rid of the degrees of

v = kh1 +ch1

freedom residing in h. the basic idea of this construction is to do a partial bosonization

of the g currents, by expressing them in terms of the h currents and extra , ,  systems,

and to subsequently set the h currents to zero. one nds that the stress tensor that
survives is quadratic in the remaining elds. for a special value of the level kg, the

original g current algebra survives. general expressions for the partial bosonizations

that one needs to implement this construction are given in [18]. we rst illustrate this

procedure for the case sl(3)/sl(2) in the lagrangian formalism, and then turn to more

general examples.

3.1. sl(3)/sl(2)

the discussion in this section will be completely classical. to discuss the coset for

sl(3)/sl(2), we start by taking the following gauss decomposition for sl(3)

g =

(3.1)

where gsl2 is a group element of sl(2), which is embedded in sl3 in the bottom right 2  2
block. we write g = gu gsl2gdgl. the wzw action evaluated for g is

sw zw (g) = sw zw (gd) + sw zw (gsl2) +

u gu gsl2gd glg1

l g1

d g1

k

2 z tr(g1

the last term above can be written explicitly:

e3igij
sl2

j.

sl2

)

(3.2)

(3.3)

this form shows the interaction between sl(2) and remaining degrees of freedom. the

idea of the novel type of coset is to set gsl2 = 1. classically this is not problematic, but in
the quantum theory gsl2 has a nonzero conformal weight and cannot simply be put equal
to one. later we will see how the theory has to be modied so as to preserve conformal

invariance after gsl2 has been put equal to one. after putting gsl2 equal to one, the target
space m of the theory will be the submanifold gu gdgl  g parametrized by gu , gd and

10

gl. this is not quite the homogeneous space sl(3)/sl(2), because tangent vectors to

m are not orthogonal to the sl2 killing vectors, and the corresponding faddeev-popov

determinant is absent. it is also not the target space of the usual coset construction. in

fact, as we will see below, it is ads5.

the next step is to bosonize (3.2) in the lagrangian approach, following [16], which

involves changing variables from i and i to i and i, so that the last term in (3.2)

becomes the free action r i i. therefore, the change of variables reads

i = e3gsl2i.

(3.4)

this change of variables has a jacobian which can be found for example in [16]. this

jacobian leads to a shift in the coecient of the kinetic term for , introduces an improve-

ment term for  (i.e. a linear dilaton background) and changes the level of the sl2 wzw

theory, all in such a way that the conformal invariance and central charge of the theory

remain unaltered. however, the discussion in this section will be purely classical and we

will ignore this jacobian.

in matrix form, the change of variables (3.4) reads




0 1 2
0
0
0
0

0
0


 = g1

d g1

sl2

g1
u gu gsl2gd

(3.5)

when inserted in the action we nd that the last term becomes the sum of two free

beta-gamma systems, and it is also immediately clear that the stress-energy tensor will be

the direct sum of that of the wzw theories for gd, gsl2 and that of the two beta-gamma
systems. by working out the sl3 current g1g, we nd an expression for the sl3 current
in terms of the sl2 currents, and 1, 2, 1, 2, . this is the realization as in (4.7.22) of

[16].

in addition, (3.5) enables us to express 1 and 2 in terms of the other elds.

requiring that the integral of these vanish, or are equal to the monodromies of , provides

the two screening charges for this type of free eld realization. (the number of screening

charges is always dim gl = dim gu .) now let us try to remove the sl2 degrees of freedom

by putting gsl2 = 1. the relation (3.5)with gsl2 = 1 becomes

(3.6)

11

the screening charges are therefore r e31 and r e32, similar to (4.1.22-24) of [16]

with the sl2 degrees of freedom removed. we now want to use these screening charges to
nd the action of the reduced theory. thus we substitute 1 = e31 and 2 = e32
back into the action

and get

s =

1

s = sw zw (gd) +

k

2 z (1 1 + 2 2)
2 z (3  + e3(1 1 + 2 2))

(3.7)

(3.8)

up to a rescaling, this is the action of ads5 that we presented in the previous section. the
nal action in terms of group variables simply reads

s = sw zw (gu gdgl).

(3.9)

thus the process of rst bosonizing, removing the sl2 degrees of freedom and then undoing
the bosonization amounts to the same as removing the sl2 degrees of freedom from the
gauss decomposition of the sl(3) group element. in fact, as will we argue later, the action

(3.9) describes an exact conformal eld theory once a suitable linear dilaton background,

which makes the conformal weights of all screening currents equal the one, is included.

3.2. bosonization

let us now discuss the bosonization of the sigma model for ads2d+1, given in (2.3),

in the path integral framework. the action reads

s =

k

2 z d2z (  + e2r r) +

1

2 z d2z (d  1)gr.

(3.10)

the measure in the path integral is dened through the sigma model metric as

z [()2 + e2x rr]

(3.11)

we can map the sigma model to a theory of free elds if we introduce new elds

r = e2r

(3.12)

the jacobian j for this change of variables is nontrivial and can be computed through the

anomaly in the determinant

j = detd[e2 e2]

(3.13)

12

exactly like in [16] leading to the result

logj = d/(4)z d2z [4  + 2r]

(3.14)

at the same time after the above change of variables the measure becomes the standard

one for the free elds r, r,  and nally we get the quantum action

sq =

1

4 z d2z ((2k  4d)  + 2kr r  2gr).

the change of variables also produces the screening charges

z r =z re2.

(3.15)

(3.16)

the background charge of the eld  in (3.15) is precisely such that the screening charge

has conformal weight zero, which is a necessary condition for conformal invariance.

at this stage we have obtained two bosonized version of the sigma model (2.3), namely

the chirally bosonized version (3.15) and the non-chirally bosonized version (2.4). one of

the main applications of free eld realization for wzw models is that it allows one to

compute correlator functions. this has been worked out in [15], [16], [21], [22], [23] [24],

[25] [26] .

the chiral bosonized version of the action can be used to compute the conformal

blocks of the cft. to combine left and right-moving conformal blocks we need the non-

chirally bosonized action. the non-chirally bosonized action consists of the chiral and
anti-chiral bosonized action, perturbed by operators of the form s s where s is often a
screening current. suppose that we are interested in studying a cft with some chiral

algebra a. if a is generated by the operators that commute with a given set of screening

charges qr = h sr, then the conformal blocks of the theory can be studied using only

the screening charges qr, which are called the simple screening charges. one might think
that the action describing the full cft is then simply the sum of the chiral and anti-

chiral bosonized action perturbed by p sr sr. this is not the full story however. the

variation of sr under the transformations generated by an element of a is a total derivative,
sr = yr, so that the screening charges qr are invariant. it is then clear that the variation

of r d2z pr sr sr is not zero but rather r d2z pr yr sr. this vanishes on-shell but not

o-shell. to nd an action which is invariant, we need to modify the transformation rules

of the elds and sometimes include additional terms in the action that look like higher

powers of the simple screening currents, and which give rise to the non-simple screening

13

charges. this does not happen in (2.4), but if we bosonize the sl(3) wzw theory we

nd that the free eld action perturbed by the two simple screening currents does not

have sl(3) current algebra; for that one needs to add an additional term to the action,

which is built out of iterated simple screening currents, i.e. non-simple screening currents.

after the addition of the additional term, the action is identical to the classical sl(3)

wzw action. this procedure is certainly correct for sl(n ), but we are not aware of any

good explanation in the literature. (as we mentioned before, bosonization allows one to

exactly solve wzw theories with compact groups like su (n ), by analytic continuation of

the results for sl(n ). the precise meaning of holomorphic factorization for noncompact

groups like sl(2, r) is not clear; one expect eects similar to the liouville model, where

one nds that correlators depend non-analytically on the cosmological constant , which
is the coecient in front of the perturbation e in the lagrangian.) the point we want to

make is that in order to compute certain quantities it is sucient to give a set of simple

screening charges and the symmetries of the problem one wants to preserve. the simple

screening charges give the conformal blocks, and the coupling of left and right movers

follows by imposing the symmetries of the problem. the symmetries of the problem allow

one to construct, order by order, the action that is invariant under those symmetries, which

then in turns provides the required coupling of left and right movers. an example of this

will appear in section 4 of the paper.

3.3. general bosonic case

the type of coset construction we have been considering can in principle be done for

any generalized gauss decomposition g = guh0gdgl. here, h0 takes values in a product of
simple factors h0  h  h1  h2  . . ., gd takes values in an abelian group, and gd and gl
are certain upper and lower triangular matrices. the idea of the coset construction is to

somehow get rid of the degrees of freedom residing in h [16].

in case the subgroup guhgd of g is parabolic, the construction of [18] can be used
to nd an explicit representation of the g currents in terms of ,  systems associated to
gu,l, scalar elds i parametrizing gd, and h = h1  h2 . . . currents. the level ki of
the hi currents is ki + chi
v . in addition, there is a set of screening charges,
and the stress tensor of the theory contains improvement terms for the scalars i. to get
rid of the degrees of freedom in h we cannot use conventional coset techniques, because

v = kg + cg

the h currents themselves are not part of the theory (they do not commute with the

screening charges). this is reected in the fact that the level of the hi current algebra

14

diers from that of g. therefore we propose to do the following: remove the h degrees of

freedom by hand, and subsequently adjust the background charges in such a way that the

screening charges keep the right conformal weight. classically this amounts to replacing

swzw(guh0gdgl) by swzw(gugdgl), but in the quantum theory we will also nd a nontrivial

dilaton. because the screening charges give exactly marginal deformations of the reduced

theory, this procedure will always give an exact conformal background.

its correlation

functions can in principle be computed using free eld methods. nevertheless, it would be

interesting to know if there is a more direct way to obtain the reduced theory from the

original theory. for instance, one could try to gauge the h-degrees of freedom, thereby

replacing the h-wzw theory by a topological h/h model, or one could try to dene

the reduced theory as the brst cohomology of a suitable brst operator of the original

theory.

we illustrate the general method now by considering the case g = sl(n ) and

h = sl(p1)  . . .  sl(pr), with p pi = n . the sl(pi) are embedded as diagonal
pi  pi matrices in sl(n ), with sl(p1) appearing in the top left block, and sl(pr) ap-
pearing in the right bottom block. the abelian group gd is parametrized by r  1 scalar
elds i.
in addition there are r  1 screening charges, associated to the simple roots
p1 , p1+p2 , . . . , p1+...+pr1 . the ith screening charge is composed out of polynomials in
the , -elds, a vertex operator for the h-theory that creates the pipi+1 dimensional (bi-
fundamental) representation of sl(pi)  sl(pi+1), and an exponential of the scalar elds
i. if we now remove the h degrees of freedom from the theory, the ith screening charge
decomposes into pipi+1 screening charges, each with the same exponent of i. to make

sure that all screening charges are contour integrals of objects of conformal weight one, we
need to adjust the background charges of the scalar elds i. since there are r 1 dierent
exponentials of the elds i, we get r  1 equations for r  1 background charges, that
have a unique solution. the stress tensor of the reduced theory is then the sum of free , 

stress tensors and improved stress tensors for i. the central charge of this theory can be

shown to be equal to

(3.19)

as a check, we notice that for pi = 1 and r = n , we get y = n (n 2  1)/3 and we
recover from (3.17) the usual central charge of the sl(n ) wzw theory. in this case the

reduced theory is equivalent to the original wzw theory, as h is trivial.

another example that is straightforward is sl(d + 1)/sl(d). this corresponds to

r = 2 and p1 = 1, p2 = d. we get y = (d + 1)/d and

c = (2d + 1) +

3(d + 1)

d(k  d  1)

.

(3.20)

the resulting theory describes strings propagating on ads2d+1. to see this, we generalize

the example described in the beginning of section 2.1 to sl(d + 1), by taking gd =
diag(ed, e, . . . , e). we obtain the classical action

s =

k

2 z d2z(d(d + 1)  + 2e(d+1)xr

r r).

(3.21)

after an appropriate rescaling of the elds we obtain the action as in (2.3) but with k

replaced by 2kd/(d + 1).

if we make the same replacement for k in (2.15), we obtain

precisely (3.20), as expected.

4. nsr formulation

we now turn to the supersymmetrization of the ads2d+1 sigma models of section 2,

so that they will have n = 1 world-sheet supersymmetry. to achieve this, we write the

sigma models of section 2 in terms of the following superelds

i = i + l
i = i +  l

 =  + l + r +  f
i +  gi
i +   gi
si = i + i + ui +  hi
si = i + ui +  i +   hi

i + r
i +  r

16

(4.1)

the supersymmetric versions of (2.3) and (2.4) read

s =

2
+

4 z d2zd2(d+d + e2d+ idi)

and

s =

2
+

4 z d2zd2(d+d  sid+ i + sidi  e2si si)

(4.2)

(4.3)

where d+ =  +  and d =   +  . after integrating out the superelds si, si from
(4.3) we clearly recover (4.2). in addition, there is a linear coupling of  to the n = 1

super world-sheet curvature [27] that we have not explicitly written

next, we study these actions in components. from action (4.2) we get

(4.5)

(4.6)

the third line contains some terms that make the fermion kinetic terms covariant,

the last line is the four-fermion term that multiplies the curvature of the connection with

torsion. this curvature is not supposed to be zero unless we are in ads3. indeed, the last
line vanishes for ads3. this is because the beta-functions state that the ricci tensor with

17

torsion is equal to the second covariant derivative of the dilaton. so the nonvanishing four

fermion term is directly related to the presence of a nonzero dilaton.

to bosonize the action (4.6) and to write it as a theory of free elds perturbed by

exactly marginal operators, it is easier to start with (4.3) rather than trying to bosonize

(4.6) directly.

the component expansion of (4.3) reads

(4.7)

i and e2 l

the role of e2r

is taken over by i and i respectively. this is clear from
the hi and hi equations of motion. after eliminating h, g, u from (4.7) and a rescaling
of the elds we get the following form of the action

(4.8)

this is probably the most useful form of the action.

it has the structure discussed in

section 3.2. there are d simple screening charges given by

si = e2/+(i 

2
+

li)

(4.9)

but the action is not just the sum of a free eld piece and si si, there is also the term
e4/+iij j. as is clear from the prefactor e4/+, this term is of higher order in
the e2/+ expansion and it is needed to restore the n = 1 world-sheet invariance of the
theory. according to our discussion in section 3.2, it will not play a role in the construction

18

of the conformal blocks of the theory, but is important in order to correctly combine left

and right movers. a further clarication of this point is certainly desirable.

as a side remark, we notice that it is possible to write everything as free eld theory

perturbed by simple screening currents only. to accomplish this, we rst add to (4.8)

1

4 z d2z (aij + e2/+ij)( aij + e2/+ ij),

(4.10)

which removes the four fermion terms but at the cost of introducing d(d  1)/2 auxiliary
elds aij. next we make the change of variables aij = ij, aij =  ij, and represent the
ij, ij
corresponding determinant by an integral over d(d 1)/2 pairs of fermionic 
systems. altogether, the four-fermion terms have now been replaced by the sum sf + ss
of the free eld action

ij , ij,  

sf =

1

4 z d2z (

ij


ij + 
ij  ij + ij  ij)

and the perturbation by simple screening currents

ss =

1

4 z d2z (e2/+  ijij + e2/+ij ij).

(4.11)

(4.12)

it is not clear, however, what replaces the n = 1 algebra in this formulation of the theory,

which is somewhat reminiscent of the formulation in [10].

we now discuss the n = 1 world-sheet superconformal algebra of (4.8). the n = 1

super stress-energy tensor of (4.2) is

+ g = d+  e2d+d+id+ i +
2

1

e2id+ i +

(4.13)

and that of (4.3) is

d+sid+i +

sii.

(4.14)

this does not yet contain the improvement term due to the dilaton. the improvement

term is simply given by

gdil = qd+

(4.15)

let us now focus on (4.14) and work it out in components. this will then give g and t

for (4.8). we get

g = l +

(4.17)

these are the suitably normalized generators of the n = 1 superconformal algebra with
central charge c = 3(2d+1)
2 + 3q2. their form agrees with the standard form of the n = 1

superconformal algebra for free elds with some improvement terms.

we need to verify whether the simple screening charges (4.9) indeed commute with

the n = 1 algebra. from the action (4.8) we obtain the following free eld opes

(z)(w)   log |z  w|2, l(z)l(w)  (z  w)1,

i(z)j(w)  2ij (z  w)1,

i(z)l

j (w)  2ij (z  w)1

in order for the screening currents to have conformal weight one, we need that

q =

2

.

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

furthermore, the screening charges indeed preserve the complete n = 1 structure, because

we have the ope

(z  w)2

(4.21)

5. spacetime supersymmetry

we next discuss spacetime supersymmetry of the n = 1 supersymmetric ads sigma
models. we take the compactication with ads2d1+1  s2d2+1. what we mean by s2d2+1
is explained in section 2.2. the notation that we will use is as follows: variables and elds

that describe ads2d1+1 will be denoted by the same symbols as in the previous section,
the variables and elds from the second factor s2d2+1 will be denoted by the same symbols

as well, but with a tilde on them. the elds and quantities with a tilde have not yet been

analytically continued. in particular, to get the right value for the central charge c = 15,
we need d1 + d2 + 1 = 5 and + = i+. the zero modes of the fermions in the rr sector
form some kind of cliord algebra. we have for instance

{(i)0, (l

j )0} = 2ij ,
20

0 , l

{l

0 } = 1.

(5.1)

thus the zero modes can be represented via gamma matrices. we denote by  the gamma
matrix representing the zero mode of . now the rr vacua of the fermions are created
by spin elds v, where  runs from 1 to 2d1+d2+1. we also have the ope

(z)v(w) =

v(w)

()
(z  w)1/2 + . . .

(5.2)

an explicit representation for the gamma matrices can be given using matrices like

  3  . . .  3  i  1  . . .  1,

i = 1, 2.

(5.3)

as in the usual nsr string, we will attempt to construct the spacetime supersymme-

try generators using rr ground states of conformal weight 5/8 and the bosonized super-

reparametrization ghosts. what makes life complicated is that the most general vertex

operator that creates a rr ground state is not some linear combination of the v. this is
because we have the elds i, whose zero modes are well-dened. these zero modes can
be multiplied arbitrarily with the rr vacua and the state will still be a rr vacuum. thus

the most general vertex operator that creates an rr ground state is

v  f (i, i)v.

(5.4)

we now want to examine which vertex operators survive in the perturbed n = 1

theory. for this we need to check that they commute with the screening charges, and that

they have correct opes with the supersymmetry generators.

we start by looking at the ope with the screening currents. the e2/+ factor

doesnt do anything and can be ignored. what remains is

(i

+

li)(z) v (w) 

2 

i

f (i, i)v + 2
+

f (i, i)(li )

v

(z  w)

+ . . .

(5.5)

thus we nd a set of rst order dierential equations for the functions f . probably,
these are equivalent to the killing spinor equations in ads2d1+1s2d2+1 with ns two-form
and dilaton turned on. to examine the solutions, we dierentiate once more and we nd

because the dierent s anticommute, this leads to the consistency conditions

f(j i )

 = f(j i )

 = 0

(5.8)

(5.9)

the number of solutions to these equations is counted as follows: f can either be
in the kernel of all i at the same time, or it can be in the kernel of all i except one.
using the explicit representation of the  matrices above, one sees that there are no other

possibilities, and that each of these possibilities reduces the numbers of supersymmetries
by 2d1 . there are d1 + 1 possibilities though.
be analyzed. the result is that the number of rr ground states that commute with all

in a similar way the tilded sector can

screening charges is equal to

2d1 (d1 + 1)2d2 (d2 + 1)2d1+d2+1 = 2(d1 + 1)(d2 + 1)

(5.10)

for ads3 we can make a change of variables

1 = 1,

l = l

11,

1l

l1

(5.11)

this change of variables leaves the opes of the fermions invariant, and it also leaves the

opes between  and the fermions invariant (i.e. they commute). the screening current
is now just e2/+ , and clearly leaves all rr ground states made from hatted fermions
invariant. this is in agreement with the result above where we found 8 invariant states for
ads3  ads3.

it remains to examine whether the vertex operators that create the rr ground states

have the correct opes with the n = 1 supersymmetry generator. to get no pole in the

ope of g with v of order 3/2, we need

(f (li  l

(5.13)

22

we already know that all i except at most one yield zero when acting on f , and
similarly for i . take an f  for which all s except maybe 1 and 1 have zero

eigenvalue. we can then rewrite (5.13) as

f ([1 , l

1

 =

f ([1 ,  l

after some further manipulations we get

(5.14)

(5.15)

the operator [, ] has eigenvalues 2i, whereas [1 , l
] have eigen-
value 2. thus we see that the eigenvalues are correlated in some way, depending on
whether + = +i+ or i+. (which was needed in order that we get the central charge
c = 3(d1 + d2 + 1)). this correlation, which also applies to the the cases when other i
annihilate f , removes another half of the supersymmetries, leaving us with (d1 +1)(d2 +1)

] and [1 ,  l

1

1

spacetime supersymmetries. (of course, in case d1 + d2 < 4 we still need to add an in-

ternal sector to the theory which may increase the number of supersymmetries. this only

happens for d1 + d2 = 2 however, in which case we can get an extra factor of two.) finally,

the total number of space-time supersymmetries after combining left- and right movers is

twice the result above, i.e. 2(d1 + 1)(d2 + 1).

the correlation of the signs found above can be naturally embedded in some gso

projection; there is a subtlety related to the fact that we have -dependent coecients.

however, dierentiating with respect to some  acts as two gamma matrices and will not

disturb the sign correlation found above.

let us illustrate this for ads5s5. this is a theory with ten bosons and fermions and
central charge c = 15, and can therefore be used as an nsr string background. denote
the rr ground states as usual with ve  signs. the rst two refer to the eigenvalues of
[i , l
], the third one to the eigenvalue of [, ] and the last two to the eigenvalues of
[i ,  l
]. then the nine ground states correspond to those combinations (, , , , )
for which the rst two signs are not both minus, the last two signs are not both minus,

i

i

and for which the product of all signs is +1. the real rr ground states are, however, still

linear combinations of such states with -dependent coecients.

23

the ads5  s5 theory has a rather rich structure. for example, the following ve

currents are conserved (i.e. commute with all the screening charges)

in j2 and j3 we recognize a supersymmetric extension of the current j0 discussed in
section 2.3. out of these ve currents one can construct the following linear combination

(5.17)

if we decompose the n = 1 generator g in terms of its +1 and 1 eigenvalue with respect
to ju(1), we nd that ju(1), g+, g, t generate the c = 15 n = 2 algebra. this n = 2
algebra will probably play a crucial role in the ads5  s5 theory, in particular in nding
the precise gso projection that will give rise to a modular invariant string theory.

6. wzw cosets for supergroups

it is very interesting to repeat the construction of section 3 for supergroups, especially

in view of the results of [10] and [14]. because supergroups contain anticommmuting

world-sheet scalars, at rst sight one expects to obtain sigma models in the gs formalism.

however, we were unable to nd  symmetry in the examples below, and furthermore the

results of [10] indicate that this is probably not the correct interpretation.

below we will discuss two examples of supercosets. although the precise embedding

of these theories in a critical string theory remains elusive, both theories have several
interesting features. in particular, both have as target space ads5  s5 (after analytic
continuation). the rst example is the coset sl(3|3)/sl(2)2, the second one the coset
sl(4|4)/sp (2)2. the rst one has 18 anticommuting scalars, suggesting a close relation
with the nsr model of section 4, the second one has 32 anticommuting scalars, suggesting
a close relation with the usual gs string. the treatment of sl(4|4)/sp (2)2 will not be
quite as satisfactory as that of sl(3|3)/sl(2)2, because we have to adjust the levels of
the two sl(4)s in sl(4|4) at an intermediate stage, but the nal result will still be an
exact cft.

24

6.1. sl(3|3)/sl(2)2

we basically want to follow the same procedure as we did for sl(3)/sl(2) in section 3.

we again write g = gugsl(2)2 gdgl. to dene the various group elements appearing in this
decomposition we introduce the 3  3 matrices

the two sl(2)s live in the bottom right 2  2 block of d1, and the top left 2  2 block
of d2. after removing the sl(2)2 degrees of freedom, the remaining action is given by the
wzw action evaluated on g = gugdgl. in addition, we need a linear dilaton background
in order to make the theory exactly conformal. we will determine this dilaton background

later. the wzw action evaluated for g = gugdgl reads

s =

upon expanding the rst two lines in i, i, i we see that they describe two copies of the
ads5 sigma model discussed in section 2. the last line in (6.9) is a term bilinear in the
anticommuting scalars , . the signs arise because the action for sl(3|3) contains a
supertrace rather than an ordinary trace. furthermore we notice that the rst two lines of
(6.9) can be combined to form kw (a1d1a1)  kw (a2d2a2), with w the wzw action
for sl(4).

the next step in the construction is to bosonize (6.9). we will do this in two steps. the
rst step involves the anticommuting world-sheet scalars , , the second step involves
only the bosons of the theory.

to perform the rst step we start by redening the eld  as a1

simplify the last term in (6.9). next we redene  = m1m1
a2d2a+

2 . this changes the last term in (6.9) into:

2 =  in order to
1 , m2 =

2 with m1 = a1d1a+

( + m1

1 m1  m1

2 m2) +

(6.10)

this can be transformed in the action for a fermionic , -system by introducing the new

eld

 =  + m1

1 m1  m1

2 m2.

(6.11)

into m1

from this expression we see that  transforms under the action of sl(3)  sl(3)
1 m2 and therefore the jacobian for the change of variables (6.11) is given by
the wzw actions for m1 and m2, computed in the bi-fundamental representation. since
the bi-fundamental representation of sl(3)  sl(3) contains 3 fundamental representations
of each sl(3), we obtain the following correction to the action

+3w ((a1d1a1)) + 3w (a2d2a2)

(6.12)

this, combined with the rst two terms in our action, leads to a renormalisation of

the coupling in front of these terms. the full action at this stage reads

(k + 3)w ((a1d1a1)) + (k + 3)w (a2d2a2) +

k

2 z  

(6.13)

having bosonized the anti-commuting degrees of freedom, it remains to bosonize the

bosonic degrees of freedom. this can be done exactly as explained in section 3. the rst

two terms in (6.13) correspond to two sl(3)/sl(2) versions of our coset construction,
one with level k + 3 and another with level k + 3. thus we can use the results in

26

section 3.2 and conclude that the shift by 3 gets canceled. we also obtain two bosonic

screening charges for each sl(3) of the form given in (3.16). after a rescaling of the elds

the system is described by the action

s =

1

4 z ((1 1  2 2) + q1r1 + q2r2

+1
i

i + 2

i +  +)

with

q1 =r 3

8k

,

q2 =r 3

8k

(6.14)

(6.15)

the change of variables for both the anti-commuting and the commuting degrees of

freedom generate screening charges. the bosonic ones are obtained from (3.16), and in the

normalization (6.14) they are given by

si =z ie3/2k1 ,

i = 1, 2, si =z ie3/2k2,

i = 3, 4.

(6.16)

these screening charges do not have conformal weight equal to zero, because the

charges qi are equal to twice the momenta in (6.16). therefore this theory is not conformal.
this should not come as a surprise, because we already knew from the sl(3)/sl(2)

example in section 2 that the only way to make sense out of the theory is add a suitable

linear dilaton background from the start. here we see that we should have added the linear

dilaton background

 =

(6.17)

at the beginning to make the theory conformal. the nal exact cft is therefore given by

(6.14) with qi replaced by qi/2, it has central charge

c = 5 + 12

3

32k

+ 5  12

3
32k  18 = 8

(6.18)

and it has the screening charges (6.16), plus certain fermionic screening charges. the latter

originate from the change of variables (6.11):

m1m1

2 = (m1m1
2 )

(6.19)

some of the fermionic screening charges are simple, and some of them are iterated.

following the discussion in section 3.2, we will only present the simple fermionic screening

charges and verify whether they have conformal weight one. this is a nontrivial statement,

27

as we already used all available freedom to change the background charges of the scalars

in order to give the bosonic screening charges the right conformal weight.

the fermionic screening charges, as is clear from (6.19), are the contour integrals
2 . let us denote the components of  by ij , and the i, j component of
by sij. then out of a total of nine fermionic screening currents we nd the

of m1m1
m1m1
following four simple ones charges

2

s21 =e(12)/6k(21 + 111  234  1314)
s22 =e(12)/6k(22 + 121  233  1313)
s31 =e(12)/6k(31 + 112  334  1324)
s32 =e(12)/6k(32 + 122  333  1323)

(6.20)

the conformal weight of exp(p11 + p22) equals p1(p1 + q1)/2 + p2(p2 + q2)/2, and
since q1 = q2 this vanishes when p1 = p2. therefore all four fermionic screening charges
have the right conformal weight..

this completes the construction of the cft announced in the introduction for the case
of sl(3|3)/sl(2)2. it has ads5  s5 target space, 18 anticommuting world-sheet scalars
and bosonic and fermionic b-elds turned on. we have shown that theory is exactly

conformal and can be bosonised with the help of the free elds and screening operators

listed above.

6.2. a comment on the bosonization of sl(n|n )

the change of variables (6.11) can also be applied to the sl(n|n ) wzw theory. the

result is an action of the form

s = (k + n )w (g1) + (k + n )w (g2) +

k

2 z d2z 

(6.21)

where g1 and g2 are arbitrary sl3 group elements, and ,  are anticommuting n  n
matrices. explicit expressions for the sl(n|n ) currents in terms of the variables in (6.21)
are given in [17]. the central charge of (6.21) is

c =

(k + n )(n 2  1)

k + n  n

+

(k + n )(n 2  1)

k + n  n

 2n 2 = 2

(6.22)

which is indeed the correct result for sl(n|n ). by adding two more free scalar elds
we nd a theory that has c = 0.
this is the gl(n|n ) theory that was studied as a

28

topological eld theory in [28]. the change of variables above maps it to the topological

gl(n )/gl(n ) theory, although this is not an exact equivalence, because the change of

variables introduces certain fermionic screening charges in the theory. along the same
lines, the sl(n|n ) wzw theory is can be mapped to the topological sl(n )/sl(n )
theory together with one additional free anticommuting ,  system.

in the case of sl(2|2), the map above is essentially the one discussed in section 10 of
[10], namely it maps the sl(2|2) wzw model to two copies of the sl(2) wzw model
plus four anticommuting ,  systems. a further change of variables then maps it to the
standard nsr description of strings on ads3  s3 with only ns background elds turned
on.

6.3. sl(4, 4)/sp (2)2

because the gs string on ads5 s5 is described by a sigma model whose target space
is (a suitable real form of) the coset superspace sl(4, 4)/sp (2)2, it is very interesting to
examine what happens when we examine our coset for sl(4, 4)/sp (2)2. one novelty

here is that we dont know whether it is possible to express sl(4) currents in terms of

sp (2) currents and additional free scalars and ,  systems. this is because sp (2) is not

generated by a subset of the positive and negative simple roots, and therefore the results

in [18] cannot be used. still, we will try to construct an exact cft by repeating the

procedure we have been following so far. we write g = gugsp(2)2gdgl, and then remove the
sp (2)2 degrees of freedom. it will turn out that in order to obtain an exact cft, we not

only need to adjust the background charges, but we also need to adjust the levels of some

of the wzw actions that appear in the discussion. this is probably related to the absence

of a realization of sl(4) currents in terms of sp (2), as mentioned above.

except for this, the construction of the exact cft follows closely the construction for
sl(3|3)/sl(2)2. we begin by dening gu, gd, gl in terms of the auxiliary 4  4 matrices

and this leads to an action which is very similar to (6.9):

s =

 z (1 1  2 2)+

k

2 z tr((a1d1a1)1(a1

2 )))

(6.25)

(6.26)

(6.27)

(6.28)

(6.29)

(6.30)

.

(6.31)

again, the rst two lines are just kw (a1d1a1)kw (a2d2a2), with w the wzw action.
however, in contrast to the case of sl(3|3)/sl(2)2, it turns out that the classical action
(6.9) does not quite correspond to an exact cft. we have to slightly modify it by hand,

namely in order to obtain an exact cft we should adjust the levels in (6.31) to

4
3

)w (a1d1a1) + (k 
s = (k 
2 z tr((a1d1a1)1(a1

k

4
3

)w (a2d2a2)+

2 )(a2d2a2) ((a1

(6.32)

these shifts of k look rather awkward. perhaps there is a better way to obtain the same

nal answer without making such shifts in the levels. at this point we lack a better

geometrical description of this coset. we will comment on this later.

30

to continue the bosonization procedure, we redene the eld  exactly as in (6.10)
and (6.11). in this case,  transforms in the bifundamental representation of sl(4)sl(4)
which contains four fundamentals for each sl(4). this leads to a correction to the action

of the form

+4w (a1d1a1) + 4w (a2d2a2)

and the full action at this stage reads

(k +

8
3

)w (a1d1a1) + (k +

8
3

)w (a2d2a2) +

k

2 z  

(6.33)

(6.34)

next, we bosonize the bosonic part of the action. this is given by the sl(4)/sp (2)

version of our general construction. this is similar to sl(4)/sl(3), except that there are
only two rather than three ,  pairs. correspondingly, the shift of k will not be by 4
but only by 8/33. as a result, the various 8/3s cancel, and after a suitable rescaling of
the elds we obtain the free eld action

s =

1

4 z ((1 1  2 2) + q1r1 + q2r2

with background charges

q1 =

3k

,

q2 =

(6.35)

(6.36)

now everything is practically the same as before. the various changes of variables give

rise to bosonic and fermionic screening charges. the explicit expressions for the simple

screening charges will be given in a moment.

in order that the screening charges have

conformal weight zero, we need to replace qi by qi/2 in (6.35). thus the nal exact cft

is given by (6.35), with qi = 2/3k. it has central charge 22, four bosonic screening

charges and sixteen fermionic screening charges, of which nine are simple and seven are

iterated. the bosonic screening charges are

si =z ie21/3k,

i = 1, 2, si =z ie22/3k,

i = 3, 4.

(6.37)

3 the fact that the shift here is 8/3 as opposed to 4 explains the adjustment we had to
make in order to go from (6.31) to (6.32). if we would be able to express sl(4) currents in terms

of sp (2) currents and free , ,  elds, there probably would be no need to adjust levels by hand

and the whole construction would appear more natural. however, at present we do not know

either algebraically or in the lagrangian approach whether this is possible.

31

to write down the simple fermionic screening charges, we denote the components of 
by sij. the nine simple fermionic screening

by ij, and the i, j component of m1m1
currents are given by

2

s21 =e(12)/12k(21 + 111)
s22 =e(12)/12k(22 + 121  244  1414)
s23 =e(12)/12k(23 + 131  243  1413)
s31 =e(12)/12k(31 + 112)
s32 =e(12)/12k(32 + 122  344  1424)
s33 =e(12)/12k(33 + 132  343  1423)
s41 =e(12)/12k41
s42 =e(12)/12k(42  444)
s43 =e(12)/12k(43  443).

(6.38)

this concludes the description of the exact cft based on sl(4|4)/sp (2)2.

7. conclusions

in this paper we considered various conformal eld theories whose target space geome-

try is an anti-de sitter space. we have not yet achieved a full understanding of these cfts.

one issue that requires a precise justication is that of simple versus iterated screening

charges. we assumed by analogy with wzw theory (when the rank of the group is greater

than one) that the conformal blocks of the nsr version of the ads2d+1 sigma model can
be computed using only simple screening charges. a deeper understanding of this assump-

tion and the way the left and right movers should be combined is certainly desirable, in

particular in order to construct a complete modular invariant theory with a proper gso

projection. in this context we would like to note the similarities with c < 1 theories (min-

imal models) coupled to c > 1 liouville theory, where the non-compact part of our target

space plays the role of the liouville model and the compact part (i.e. the part which is

analytically continued in ) corresponds to the minimal model. however, the quantization

of strings on ads spaces will undoubtedly lead to the same problems that one encounters

when one studies string theory on sl(2, r) [29].

although the coset theories for supergroups discussed in section 6 look very suggestive,

it is not yet clear how to use them to construct consistent string backgrounds. based on

32

the number of supersymmetries, the sl(3|3)/sl(2)2 model appears related to the nsr
string on ads5  s5 of section 4, whereas the sl(4|4)/sp (2)2 appears related to the
usual string theory on ads5  s5 with rr ve-form ux. it would be very interesting
to understand these relations in more detail. in particular, one could look for additional

world-sheet symmetries, or for an analogue of -symmetry. once the space-time interpre-

tation of these theories is understood, one could analyze whether they do in fact describe

theories with some rr background turned on (as we already mentioned, we suspect that

rr backgrounds are related to fermionic screening charges) or whether one needs to per-

turb the theories away from the wzw point in order to turn on rr backgrounds.

the theories we have described in this paper do have holographic behavior, and this

raises the question which boundary quantum eld theories are associated to them. to

answer this question, it would be helpful to know to which brane congurations they
correspond. the ads2d1+1  s2d2+1 solutions appear to be related to peculiar delocalized
superpositions of intersecting fundamental strings and ns vebranes. the meaning of

these congurations is, however, rather obscure.

to summarize, we have described various exact cfts with ads target spaces, some

of which can be used to build critical string backgrounds. we believe that a further study

of these theories will teach us more about exactly solvable cfts and their space-time

interpretation, as well as the world-sheet formulation of ads/cft duality.
