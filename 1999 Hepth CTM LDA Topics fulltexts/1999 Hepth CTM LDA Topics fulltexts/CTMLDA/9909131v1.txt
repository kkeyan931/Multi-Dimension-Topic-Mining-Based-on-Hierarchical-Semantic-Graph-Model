abstract

this paper is a shortened version of the previous work [2]: we propose
a topological quantum eld theory as a twisted candidate to formulate
covariant matrix strings. the model relies on the octonionic or complex-
ied instanton equations dened on an eight dimensional manifold with
reduced holonomy. to allow untwisting of the model without producing
an anomaly, we suggest (partially twisted) w-gravity as an extended
2d-gravity sector.

the covariantization with respect to both worldsheet and spacetime
symmetries of the orbifold theory of dijkgraaf, verlinde and verlinde [1],
if it can be achieved, should produce a covariant formulation of the sec-
ond quantized free string theory. the statement that these covariant
matrix strings exist is quite obvious in the commuting limit. indeed, con-
sider the superconformal theory constructed as the sum of n copies of
the standard neveuschwarzramond (nsr) superstring. it has central
charge c = n 0 and involves the following sets of elds: bosons x 
i , left
and right moving fermions 
i;l,r and 2d gravity ghosts (bi, ci), (i, i).
the indices ,  = 1    10 are acted on by the ten-dimensional lorentz
group, and the index i = 1    n by the sn symmetry group. this the-
ory, whose action is simply the sum of n nsr superstrings actions,
can be orbifolded with respect to the sn symmetry (add twisted sec-
tors the long strings and project onto the invariant states). orb-
ifolding preserves both the manifest ten-dimensional and (less manifest)

two-dimensional covariance, and the theory it leads to has all the nice
features of a covariant string theory. it exhibits a w-like chiral algebra,
generated by the stress energy tensor t = pi ti and its higher spin
analogues wl=1n = pi t l
i . furthermore, one can show that on the
cylinder, the theory is equivalent to the greenschwarz theory of [1].

the tricky question is of course that of going away from the gs = 0
limit. in [2], we make a step and address this issue from the twisted
point of view. namely, we propose a topological quantum eld theory
(tqft) as a twisted candidate, possibly invariant under so(8)so(2).
the tqft is based on the generalized octonionic or complexied instan-
ton equations dened in eight dimensions for a u (n ) yangmills eld [3]
and superpartners, living on an eight dimensional manifold m8 with
special holonomy.

the octonionic instantons arise from the generalized self-duality equa-

tions that occur when m8 has spin(7) holonomy:

i, j,    = 1, . . . , 7

where f denotes the curvature of the gauge eld a, and the cijk are
the structure constants for octonions.
in the case of m8 being a calabiyau fourfold, it is the su (4) instantons
one deals with, obtained from

fza za = 0,

for a, b,    = 1, . . . , 4

such equations can be used as gauge functions to dene topological
eld theories [4] in which the topological symmetry can possibly be un-
twisted into supersymmetry, in the same spirit as [5]. the theories of [3]
have been constructed in this manner and, after reduction to two dimen-
sions, provide a twisted version of the light-cone matrix strings of [1].
their topological multiplet can be untwisted into the degrees of free-
dom of the light-cone matrix string under the following correspondence,
inspired of [6] (according to the splitting m8 = m6   where  is
twodimensional and m6 is taken to be small, the gauge eld aza=14
splits as a  aza=13 and az  az4):

a, a, ,   x m=18,

a, a,  + , z  m
l ,
a, a,   , z  m
r .

here, for each classical eld (az,z, , ), the s are the topological
ghosts and the s are the antighosts. the yangmills eld also in-
volves ghosts for ghosts (the s), responsible for the gauge symmetry,

3

and the associated fermionic lagrange multiplier . all elds are u (n )
valued; the as are complex and we note a  a  a.

to go beyond the light-cone version, we make two distinct steps. the
rst one, concerning ten-dimensional spacetime covariance, is to enhance
the eld content to that of the whole eight-dimensional yangmills su-
permultiplet, to end with the degrees of freedom of a ten-dimensional
target space. hence, instead of constructing the tqft for the sole
u (n ) gauge eld a, we include its eight dimensional superpartners
, .the scalars  will provide the longitudinal coordinates, whereas
the fermions  (and topological partners) open the gate to a heterotic
sector.

this in turn naturally leads to the second step, that of two dimensional
covariance. indeed, one needs to gauge x the topological symmetry of
the fermions and scalars, and this can only be done if we dimensionally
reduce down to two dimensions. however, simplistic reduction turns
our gauge functions (1)(2) into a set of inconsistent equations. two-
dimensional covariance implies the coupling to a topological 2d grav-
ity system. the metric is introduced in the beltrami parametrization
(it allows for manifest left-right factorization [7]): ds2 = e+
z (dz +
zdz)(dz + z
z
zdz) and the symmetries are used to set the background
z , e
values of e+
z to 1. to make our gauge functions covariant, we intro-
duce additional elds, of the wesszumino type. denoted as l, l, their
l have weight
conformal weight is xed by the requirement that el and e
(1, 0) and (0, 1) respectively. making use of these, we can dene our two
dimensional covariant gauge functions, based on (2), as follows:

with derivatives now covariant with respect to both the gauge invariance
and the 2d gravity (they involve az, az, the beltramis and the christof-
fels). as for the superpartners, we choose to impose the right-moving
condition on the fermions and holomorphicity on the scalars. we have
imposed two-dimensional covariance; we deal with the degrees of free-
dom of a ten dimensional target space theory via xm =110  {x m, }
r , , +} for fermions.
for bosons, and m
the key point is then to check whether we are allowed to map our
elds to physical ones as above. indeed, it is crucial that we are able
to untwist our (topological and thus anomaly free) theory into a su-
persymmetric one without producing an anomaly: can we change the
spins of our elds to the physical ones without spoiling the vanishing
of the central charge? in the usual u (1) superstrings, the light-cone

theory is a gauge xed version where the longitudinal components are
canceled by the 2d gravity ghost systems arising from two dimensional
reparametrizations. for non-commuting strings, it is not clear how one
can make sense of matrix-valued 2d-dieomorphisms, nor what kind
of extended ghost system would be capable of compensating for the
longitudinal u (n ) degrees of freedom (namely 2(n 2  1) non-physical
bosons, and correspondingly for the fermions).
we refer the reader to [2], where we propose evidence that the appropri-
ate ghost systems might arise from the wn +1 of w partially twisted
gravity. indeed, the tqft based on the lie algebra w has an innite
series of ghosts that could be partially untwisted to produce the set of
gravitational ghost systems to compensate for the matrix strings matter
anomaly. dierent twists and gauge xings might allow to get either a
covariant nsr theory or heterotic matrix strings (via more complicated
compensations involving the fermions , in the spirit of [6]).
