(this case diagrams without external lines, consider here.) then, dierence light-front lorentz-covariant approaches persists due dierent regularizations dierent methods calculating feynman in- tegrals (which important possible absence absolute convergence pseudo-euclidean space). present paper, concentrate analysis dierence. light-front theory needs standard uv regularization, also special approach, regularization elimi- regularization singularities q = 0. nates creation operators a+(q) annihilation operators a(q) |qi | < fourier expansion eld operators eld representation. result, integration w.r.t. corresponding momentum q range (,) (,) associated line removing -functions. dierent propagators regularized independently, allows described re-arrangement perturbation theory series. hand, regularization convenient nonper- turbative numerical calculations light-front hamiltonian, necessary counter-terms added (the eective hamiltonian). require hamiltonian generate theory equivalent lorentz-covariant theory regularization removed. note lorentz-invariant methods regularization (e.g., pauli-villars reg- 2 ularization) far less convenient numerical calculations shall briey mention them. specic properties light-front feynman formalism manifest integration variables q = 12 (q0 q3), integration trans- verse momenta q {q1, q2} light-front lorentz coordinates (though might nontrivial requires regularization renormalization). therefore, concentrate comparison diagrams xed transverse momenta (which equivalent two-dimensional problem). present paper, propose method allows one nd dierence (in limit 0) light-front feynman integral corresponding lorentz- covariant integral without calculate completely. based method, procedure elaborated constructing eective hamiltonian lf order perturbation theory. procedure applied nongauge eld theories, well abelian non-abelian gauge theories gauge = 0 vector meson propagator chosen according mandelstam-leibbrandt prescription . question whether additional components hamiltonian arise combined nite number counter-terms must dealt separately particular case. application formalism yukawa model makes possible obtain eective light-front hamiltonian closed form. result agrees conclusions work , comparison made light-front lorentz-covariant methods via calculating self-energy diagrams orders perturbation theory diagrams lowest orders. conversely, gauge theories (both abelian non-abelian), found counter-terms arbitrarily high order eld operators must added eective hamiltonian. result may turn wrong contributions counter-terms mutually canceled. calls investigation, possibility appears unlikely. said depreciate light-front formalism applied gauge theories. requirement concerning light-front hamil- tonian correctly reproduces gauge-invariant quantities rather o- mass-shell feynman integrals given gauge. however, renormalization light-front hamiltonian turns dicult problem requires new approaches. examine possibilities changing light-front hamiltonian introducing new nonphysical elds method dierent pauli-villars regularization  possibilities using gauges general = 0 mandelstam-leibbrandt propagator. points also need investigated further. 3 2. reduction light-front lorentz-covariant feynman integrals form convenient comparison let us examine arbitrary ipi feynman diagram. x external momenta transverse momenta integration, integrate q+ q: f = lim 0z qi d2qi qi(2qi +qi f (qi, pk) 2 + i) . assume vertices polynomial propagator form z(q) q2 m2 + , z(q) q+ (q2 m2 + i)(2q+q + i) , (1) (2) z(q) polynomial. propagator second type (2) arises gauge theories gauge = 0 mandelstam-leibbrandt formalism  vector boson propagator (+ q + q+ 2q+q + )2q+ ! , 1 q2 + g = m2 + qi used. eq.
