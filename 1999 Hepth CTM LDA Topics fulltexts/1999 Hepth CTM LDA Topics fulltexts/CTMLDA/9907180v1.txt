recently we have proposed a set of variables for describing the physical param-
eters of su(n) yangmills eld. here we propose an o-shell generalization of our
ansatz. for this we envoke the darboux theorem to decompose arbitrary one-form
with respect to some basis of one-forms. after a partial gauge xing we identify these
forms with the preimages of holomorphic and antiholomorphic forms on the coset space
su(n)/u(1)n 1, identied as a particular coadjoint orbit. this yields an o-shell gauge
xed decomposition of the yang-mills connection that contains our original variables in
a natural fashion.

recently we have proposed a novel decomposition of the four dimensional su(n)
yang-mills connection aa
 [1], [2]. this decomposition introduces r = n  1 mutually
orthogonal unit vectors mi with r the rank of su(n), i.e. one for each generator of the
cartan subalgebra u(1)n 1. in addition there are r abelian higgs multiplets (c, , )
with scalars  and  that transform according to irreducible representations of so(n 1)
so that

(1)

in d dimensions (1) describes 2n 2 + (d  4)n + (2  d) independent variables. for
d = 4 this coincides with 2d where d = n 2  1 is the dimension of su(n). this is the
number of physically relevant eld degrees of freedom described by a su(n) yang-mills
connection aa
. accordingly we expect that the decomposition (1) is on-shell complete
[1], [2].

we have suggested that the eld multiplets which appear in the decomposition (1)
are the appropriate order parameters for describing dierent phases of the yang-mills
theory. specically, we have proposed that (1) identies the congurations that are
responsible for color connement [1].
indeed, the multiplets in (1) do support eld
congurations that are quite natural when modelling structures such as colored ux
tubes and qcd strings [3], [4]. these and some additional aspects of our decomposition
have been recently studied e.g. in [5].

unfortunately, the decomposition (1) becomes insucient at the level of a quantum
theory where functional integrals are invoked. there, we need an o-shell generaliza-
tion of (1) that describes an arbitrary connection, with full 4d eld degrees of freedom
which are subjected to d gauge xing conditions [6]. in this letter we shall present the
appropriate gauge xed o-shell extension of (1). this extension emerges when we rst
introduce a decomposition of an arbitrary connection aa
 in terms of 4d independent dar-
boux variables. we then impose an explicit gauge xing condition which eliminates d of
these variables. in this way we get a natural gauge xed extension of the decomposition
(1), with the correct number of 3d eld degrees of freedom.

first we illustrate our approach on the example of n = 2. the su(2) version of
(1) involves a three component unit vector na, an abelian gauge eld c and a single
complex scalar  + i. these we combine into a u(1) multiplet under su(2) gauge
transformations in the direction na with

aa

 = cna + abcnbnc + na + abcnbnc

or, introducing matrix notations

where  a, a = 1, 2, 3, are pauli matrices,

a = aa

 adx,

n = na a,

a = c n  i[dn, n] + dn  i[dn, n].

itis convenient to introduce a new variable g instead of n as

n = g 3g1.

(5)

it is clear that g is dened up to a right diagonal factor g  gh, so that it belongs to
the coset su(2)/u(1) = s2. we introduce the maurer-cartan one-forms

we then have

furthermore,

l = dg g1

, r = g1dg.

dn = [l, n] = g[r,  3]g1.

dn  n =

[dn, n] =

1

lof f =

i

grof f g1,

where o denotes the o-diagonal part of the matrices l and r. with this, we can write
the on-shell connection (2) as follows,

a = g (cid:18) c 3 

1
i

rdiag + [r,  3] +

1

rof f (cid:19) g1 +

where rdiag is the diagonal part of r. it is manifestly gauge equivalent to the connection

a = c 3

rdiag + [r,  3] +

rof f

(6)

and the transformation g  gh, where h = exp i 3, leaves n intact and clearly corre-
sponds to an abelian gauge transformation of the u(1) multiplet (c, , ).

we parametrize the unit vector na as

~n = 


cos  sin 
sin  sin 

cos 

.




then the lower o-diagonal component a+ of a will assume the form

a+ = ( + i)(d  i sin d).

(7)

we now invoke darboux theorem to conclude that an arbitrary four dimensional one-
form  can be almost everywhere decomposed in terms of four functions pi, qi (i = 1, 2)
according to

dx = p1dq1 + p2dq2.

this is a familiar result in symplectic geometry where we commonly write the symplectic
one-form in terms of canonical pairs of momenta pi and coordinates qi. (in the context

2

of a u(1) gauge theory such darboux variables have been previously used by gliozzi
[7].)

it is from this point of view that formula (7) is incomplete, it contains only half of
variables necessary to parametrize the complex one-form a+. observe that (7) employs
one-form

q = d  i sin d

which is the preimage of the antiholomorphic one-form on s2. the complete basis of
one-forms on s2 is given by q and its complex conjugate, holomorphic one-form

thus our new proposal is to complete (7) as

q = d + i sin d.

a+ = (1 + i1)q + (2 + i2)q.

the second o-diagonal element

a = (1  i1)q + (2  i2)q

(8)

(9)

is not completely independent from a+. it would be so if forms q and q in (8) and (9)
were dierent. we propose to interpret the identity q and q in (8) and (9) as a partial
gauge xing. the remaining gauge freedom corresponds to abelian transformations
with diagonal gauge matrices. this allows to identify c as abelian gauge eld and
1 = 1 + i1 and 2 = 2 + i2 as corresponding charged scalars.

it is easy to rewrite our proposal in matrix form. one is to use the matrix r and its

complex conjugate r. here is our nal suggestion for the su(2) yangmills eld:

a = c 3 + irdiag + 1[r,  3]  i1rof f + 2[r,  3] + i2rof f .

(10)

this formula contains ten independent eld components, corresponding to partial gauge
xing, cancelling two parameters out of twelve. r. kashaev has mentioned to us that
the gauge xing can be rewritten as a gauge condition [8]

da1  a1  a2 = da2  a2  a1 = 0

the remaining u(1) gauge freedom of the abelian multiplet can be xed in any convenient
manner. for example, we may select c = 0. the ensuing fully gauge xed connection
describes 3d = 9 independent eld degrees of freedom, as it should for the gauge group
su(2).

the generalization of our approach to su(n) is straightforward if we use the formulas
of [2]. first, the gauge transformation analogous to one used in su(2) case is based on
formula

mi = geig1,

3

where ei denote an orthonormal basis of traceless diagonal n  n matrices with

eiej =

1
2n

ij + dijkek

where dijk are completely symmetric. in terms of maurercartan matrix one-form r =
g1dg we construct the following one-forms

xi = [r, ei],

y[i,j] = eirej  ejrei,

z{i,j} = eirej + ejrei  eiejr  reiej.

notice that these dier from the corresponding formulas in [2] by x  gxg1 etc.
it is easy to see that (1) can be rewritten via those matrix forms after suitable gauge
transformation as

a = c iei 

1
i

rdiag + ixi + [i,j]y[i,j] + {i,j}z{i,j}.

(11)

one can see that only antiholomorphic forms on g/h enter into the o-diagonal elements
of this connection. thus as above we are to add also the corresponding holomorphic
components using complex conjugated matrix forms x i, y [ij] and z {ij}. the formula

a = c iei 

1
i

rdiag + ixi + [i,j]y[i,j] + {i,j}z{i,j} + i xi + [i,j] y[i,j] + {i,j} z{i,j} (12)

is our main proposal.
exactly corresponds to the partial gauge xing, cancelling n 2  n parameters.

it contains 3(n 2  1) + n  1 independent parameters which

in conclusion, we have presented an o-shell gauge xed decomposition of the su(n)
yang-mills connection, appropriate for investigating the quantum structure of the theory
in terms of functional integrals. this decomposition entails both the holomorphic and
antiholomorphic basis of one-forms on the maximal co-adjoint orbit su(n)/u(1)n 1
and generalizes our earlier on-shell construction in a natural manner. we propose that
the variables which appear in our decomposition are the relevant order parameters for
describing the various phases of the yang-mills theory. hopefully this sheds new light
to important open problems such as color connement.

we thank r. kashaev for most helpful discussions and j. mickelsson for drawing
our attention to [7]. l.d.f. also acknowledges the care he got in the heart clinic of the
danderyd hospital, where same aspects of this paper were claried.
