a non-local classical duality between the three-block truncated 11d supergravity and the 8d
vacuum gravity with two commuting killing symmetries is established. the supergravity four-
form eld is generated via an inverse dualisation of the corresponding killing two-forms in six
dimensions. 11d supersymmetry condition is shown to be equivalent to existence of covariantly
constant spinors in eight dimensions. thus any solution to the vacuum einstein equations in
eight dimensions depending on six coordinates and admitting killing spinors have supersymmetric
11d-supergravity counterparts. using this duality we derive some new brane solutions to 11d-
supergravity including 1/4 supersymmetric intersecting m -branes with a nut parameter and a
dyon solution joining the m 2 and m 5branes intersecting at a point.

to reveal classical symmetries in dimensionally re-
duced supergravities it is common to use dualisation of
the antisymmetric forms involved [1,2]. the standard
prescription consists in using this procedure to maxi-
mally reduce the rank of forms in a given dimension d,
i.e. to dualise those forms whose rank k is greater than
d k. recently it was argued that deeper understanding
of hidden symmetries requires more general dualisation
schemes, or even introduction of double space of all forms
both dualised and non-dualised with the corresponding
constraints [3]. here we want to explore a possibility
provided by an inverse dualisation (k < d  k) to nd a
non-local correspondence between supergravities involv-
ing higher rank antisymmetric forms and vacuum ein-
stein gravity admitting isometries. the main idea is to
dualise the killing forms associated with these isome-
tries in order to generate higher rank forms which could
be then reinterpreted as matter elds of suitable super-
gravity. for deniteness we consider the correspondence
between the three-block truncation of 11d-supergravity
and 8d einstein gravity with two commuting isometries.

consider the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity

assuming for the spacetimes the following threeblock
structure m 11 = m 2(za)  m 3(yi)  m 1,5(x), where
m 2 and m 3 are conformally at euclidean spaces, m 1,5
is the pseudoriemannian six-dimensional spacetime and
it is understood that all variables depend only on coor-
dinates x:

here the scalars g2, g3 and the six-dimensional metric g
are functions of x. the corresponding consistent trun-
cation of 11d supergravity involves the following ansatz
for the 11d fourform f[4] = d a[3]:

f[4]ab = abf ,
f[4] = h ,

f[4]ijk = ijk,

(3)

where h = db and f = da are the sixdimensional
fourform and twoforms respectively.

it is straightforward to show that the equations of mo-
tion for the sixdimensional variables can be derived from
the following action

our main result consists in the following
theorem: any solution of 8d vacuum einstein grav-
ity with two commuting spacelike isometries gives rise
to several solutions of the 11d supergravity of the form
(2,3). if, in addition, the 8d spacetime admits covari-
antly constant spinors, the corresponding 11d solutions
have unbroken supersymmetries.

to prove these assertions, rst we note that the scalar
elds ,  parameterize the coset sl(2, r)/so(2). to
put the action in a manifestly sl(2, r)covariant form
one has to dualise the fourform h as follows:

which can be used to generate new supergravity solu-
tions.

now let us start with the 8d einstein theory on space
times with two spacelike killing symmetries, in which
case the 8d metric can be presented as

ds2

8 = hab(da + aa
+ (det h) 1

4 gdxdx ,

dx)(db + ab

 dx )

(11)

where hab, 2  2 matrix, and aa
 are two kaluza-klein
(kk) vectors depending on x only. under the kk re-
duction to six dimensions one gets two kk twoforms,
and three scalar moduli parameterizing the metric hab.
the eight-dimensional einstein equations in terms of the
six-dimensional variables may be cast exactly into the
form (7) provided the following identication holds:

hab = e

2

3  (cid:18) e + 2e e

e (cid:19) ,

e

f = da1,

h = da2.

(12)

this completes the proof of the bosonic part of the the-
orem. note that the fourform h of the 11d super-
gravity is generated from the kk twoform by inverse
dualisation. possible permutation of two killing vectors
in (11) will lead to dierent 11d solutions. moreover,
if the actual number of commuting spacelike isometries
of the 8d solution is greater than two, one can generate
several dierent 11d solutions via dierent choice of the
ordered pair of adirections in (11).

consider now the 11d supergravity condition for van-
ishing of the supersymmetry variation of the gravitino
eld (killing spinor equation) in a bosonic background
satisfying the ansatz (2,3):

dm 11 +

p q r) f n p q r11 = 0. (13)

here 11 is a 32-component majorana spinor, and the or-
thonormal components of the gamma-matrices and the
fourform are denoted by bar. consistently with the
threeblock decomposition for the metric one assumes

a = a  0  7, i = z  i  7,
  = 0  0   ,

(14)

where a, i are two sets of 22 pauli matrices, a = x, y,
i = x, y, z, 0 and 0 are unit matrices and   are 6d
gammamatrices: { ,  } = 2  . the chiral opera-
tor is dened as 7 = 012345, so that 2
7 = 1 and
{7,  } = 0.
without loss of generality one can assume that 2 and
3 are constant spinors. then after reduction the eq.(13)
is cast into a set of three equations one of which is the
6d dierential equation for the spinor 6:

2 f (cid:17)o6 = 0,



2 7(h  +f )
(15)

where d  is the six-dimensional spinor covariant deriva-
tive and the constant spinor 2 is split into the chiral pro-
jections z2 = sz2, while two others are the algebraic
equations for 6 which impose consistency conditions on
the bosonic background:

2 f(cid:17)o6 = 0, (16)
2 7(h+f)isze76 o6 = 0. (17)

here the following notation is used

6  =    =  e
f =

f    , f  =

(18)

and similarly for h. in deriving the eqs. (15-17) all
terms containing the products of three, four and ve
gamma matrices were eliminated via the fierz identities.
one can show that these equations are equivalent to

the geometric killing spinor equation in d = 8:

dm 8 = m 8 +

a b

my a b8 = 0,

(19)

where 8 is 16-component spinor, the symbol y a b de-
notes an antisymmetric product of the 8d gamma
matrices and dm stands for the spinor covariant deriva-
tive with the riemannian connection corresponding to the
metric (11). splitting the 8d spinor as 8 = 
6, where

2 is a constant spinor, and decomposing the gamma-
matrices ya = a  7, y  = 0   , (a is the pauli
matrix) one derives from (19) a six-dimensional spinor
equation (m = ) and some matrix constraint equation
(m = a). the subsequent derivation (details will be
given elsewhere) involves an unitary transformation of
the corresponding matrix nally arriving at the eqs.(16-
17), and establishing the following correspondence be-
tween six-dimensional spinors:

2

6 = e +2


12 6.

(20)

this proves the fermionic part of our theorem. due to
the integrability condition for the eq.(19), the 8d met-
rics admitting killing spinors will be ricci-at. also, it
is worth noting that the supersymmetry conditions are
invariant under symmetry transformations (9).

we do not intend to explore here the general classes
of 11d solutions which can be generated via this dual-
ity, but rather proceed with some physically meaningful
examples. the simplest examples are the nonrotating
black m 2brane and m 5brane. consider the 8d vac-
uum metric

(22)

two commuting killing vector elds may be chosen ei-
ther as (1 , 2 ) or as (2 , 1). in the rst case, per-
forming the steps described above, we arrive at the m 2-
brane solution

and atz1z2 = at. in the second case one gets the m 5-

with the standard threeform eld [8]. for m = 0 the
8d metric (21) admits killing spinors 8 = h  1
4 0 (in
cartesian local frame), where 0 is a constant spinor sat-
ifying yyt0 = 0. this clearly corresponds to the bps
saturated m -branes.
in a similar way one can obtain
rotating branes, solutions endowed with waves and kk
monopoles as well as some their intersections.

(24)

the above construction illustrates that our mapping
from 8d to 11d is one to many, i.e. an unique 8d vac-
uum solution can have several 11d supergravity coun-
terparts depending on the choice and the order of two
killing vectors in eight dimensions. this provides a sim-
ple way to proliferate 11d solutions: taking one known
solution one can nd its 8d vacuum partner and then
go back to eleven dimensions with a dierent choice of
the killing vectors involved. for example, two well-
known vedimensional kk solutions, the brinkmann
wave and the kk-monopole, can be combined in a six
dimensional vacuum solution which has six 11d coun-
terparts including all pairwise intersections of four ba-
sic solutions: m 2brane, m 5brane, wave and monopole
except the m 2m 5brane. one can also nd the nut
generalisations of the rotating m -branes in a way similar
to that used in the ve-dimensional theory [7].

new interesting solution looking like a non-standard
intersection of the m 2 and m 5 branes at a point (not
over a string as demanded by the usual intersection rules)
can be obtained starting with the 5d kaluzaklein dyon.
the most general dyonic black hole solution of 5d kk
theory was found by gibbons and wiltshire [4] and its
rotating version by clement [5] and rasheed [6]. in the
static case this is a threeparameter family (with mass,
electric and magnetic charges m, q, p):

and the kk vector eld is given by at = c/b, a =
2p cos , c = 2qr. the scalar charge d satises the
cubic equation

where a = r2

(25)

q2/d+ + p2/d = 2d/3.

(26)

using the relations (12, 5) and then (2,3), one obtains

the 11d solution

this solution for p = 0 reduces to the usual m 2
brane while for q = 0  to the m 5brane (localized
only on a part of the full transverse space). however,
for both q, p non-zero, this is a new dyonic brane: con-
trary to the costa m 2  m 5brane [8], for which the
electric brane lies totally within the magnetic one, and
contrary to the intersecting m 2m 5brane (with a com-
mon string), now the common part of the world-volumes
is zero-dimensional (we suggest the name m 2  m 5).
the electric/magnetic charge densities are q = 8q and
p = 8p respectively.

(27)

let us derive the supersymmetry conditions for this
solution. as  = h = 0 for it and the eq.(17) is
satised identically, the only constraint on the functions
a, b, c,  is due to the eq.(16) which may be represented
as

ni6 + isz h(r) t  (r) r  io 6 = 0,

(28)

where

(r) =

b2r(c/b)

a3/21/2r(b/a)

, (r) =

2pb3/2

a21/2r(b/a)

.

non-zero solution to (28) can exist if only 2(r)+2(r) =
1, what implies asymptotically

3

p2 + q2 = 4d2/3.

(29)

combining this with the cubic constraint (26) we nd
that either i) p = 0, m = d/3, q = 2d/3, corre-
sponding to an extremal m 2-brane (23), or ii) q = 0,
m = d/3, p = 2d/3, an extremal m 5-brane (24),

otherwise the constraints lead to pure vacuum. so the
only nontrivial supersymmetric members of the family of
composite m 2  m 5-branes are the single extremal m 2
and m 5-branes.
one can also obtain the rotating version of m 2 m 5
brane (with one rotational parameter) through the fol-
lowing transformation:

(32)

the drawback of our generating technique is that the
11d branes obtained can not localize on all coordinates of
transverse space, since our basic ansatz (2) is not general
enough. however one still can use it to explore possible
geometric 11d structures and then to try to localize solu-
tions in a straightforward way. here we present without
derivation (details will be given in a forthcoming paper)
a new partially localized intersecting m 2 branes with a
nut parameter:

~wf1 = 0.

(34)

this solution (contrary to its version without nut) in-
volves the chern-simons term of (1). direct check reveals
the existence of the 8d covariantly constant spinors cor-
responding to the 1/4 unbroken supersymmetry.

thus we have given a purely vacuum interpretation to
a certain class of the 11d supergravity m -branes via new
non-local duality between 11d supergravity and 8d vac-
uum einstein gravity. it is worth noting that the very
natural correspondence between the killing spinor equa-
tions in both theories may have a deeper meaning in the
context of 8d supergravities. in this connection it has to
be emphasized that the type of duality described here is
by no means related to the direct dimensional reduction
from 11d to 8d theory.
