abstract

we use the boundary state formalism to provide the full conformal de-
scription of (f,dp) bound states. these are bps congurations that arise
from a superposition of a fundamental string and a dp brane, and are charged
under both the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor and the (p + 1)-form r-r po-
tential. we construct the boundary state for these bound states by switching
on a constant electric eld on the world-volume of a dp brane and x its
value by imposing the dirac quantization condition on the charges. using
the operator formalism we also derive the dirac-born-infeld action and the
classical supergravity solutions corresponding to these congurations.

1 introduction

the boundary state, originally introduced for factorizing the planar and non-planar
open string one-loop diagrams in the closed string channel [1], has been lately very
useful for describing the d branes [2] in the framework of string theories 1. this is
because the boundary state encodes all relevant properties of the d branes; in fact,
as shown in ref. [5], it reproduces the couplings of the d branes with the massless
closed string states as dictated by the dirac-born-infeld action, and also generates
the large distance behavior of the classical d brane solutions of supergravity.

the boundary states which are usually considered in the literature describe
simple d branes, namely extended objects that are charged under only one r-
r potential. however, one expects that also more general congurations admit
a stringy description by means of boundary states with a richer structure. for
example, in ref. [5] it has already been shown that a boundary state with an
external magnetic eld describes a dp-d(p2) bound state of two d branes. in this
paper, instead, we consider boundary states with an external electric eld and show
that they provide the complete conformal description of the bound states between
a fundamental string and a dp brane denoted by (f,dp) [6]-[12]. these bound
states, which are a generalization of the dyonic strings introduced in ref. [13], are
p-dimensional extended objects which are charged under both the ns-ns two-form
potential and the r-r (p + 1)-form potential of the type ii theories. because of
this property, they behave at the same time both as dp branes and as fundamental
strings. their nature of d branes allows us to represent them by means of boundary
states, while their being also fundamental strings shows up through the presence of
an external electric eld on their world-volume.

to describe the (f,dp) bound states we introduce a boundary state containing
two parameters: an overall constant x and the constant value of the electric eld
f which can always be taken to be along one longitudinal direction only. then, by
requiring the validity of the dirac quantization condition, we show that these two
parameters can be uniquely xed in terms of a pair of integers m and n representing,
respectively, the charges of the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor and of the r-r (p + 1)-
form potential. by projecting this boundary state onto the massless states of the
closed string spectrum [5], we can obtain the long distance behavior of the massless
elds that characterize this conguration; then, we can infer the complete classical
solution describing the (f,dp) bound states and nd agreement with the results
recently obtained in ref. [10], which for p = 1 reduce to the dyonic strings of

ref. [13]. using the boundary state formalism, we also compute the interaction
energy between two (f,dp) bound states, and check that the no force condition
holds at the full string level. this fact conrms that the boundary state with an
external electric eld provides the complete stringy description of the bps bound
states formed by fundamental strings and dp branes.

this paper also contains a discussion of the limits in which one of the two
charges vanishes. while the limit m  0, corresponding to a vanishing electric
eld, is perfectly under control because in this case the (f,dp) bound state reduces
just to a dp brane, the other limit n  0 is more subtle because in this case the
(f,dp) bound state reduces to the fundamental string and one does not expect
that the latter admits a boundary state description. actually, when n  0 the
boundary state is not well dened since it contains an overall vanishing prefactor
and a divergent exponential factor involving harmonic oscillators. however, when
we project it onto the massless closed string states, the vanishing and the divergent
factors cancel each other and one is left with a nite and well-dened expression that
exactly reproduces the large distance behavior of the fundamental string solution.
motivated by this observation, we propose a modied form of boundary state that
generates the fundamental string solution in the same way as the standard boundary
state does for the d branes. this operator can be regarded as an eective conformal
description of the fundamental string, which, however, cannot be the complete one.
this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we write the boundary state
with an external constant gauge eld using the formalism developed in ref. [3].
then, by projecting it along the massless states of the closed string spectrum, we
derive the dirac-born-infeld action with its wess-zumino term. in section 3 we
consider the boundary state for a dp brane with a constant external electric eld, x
its form by imposing the dirac quantization condition on the charges of the ns-ns
and r-r potentials, and then obtain the corresponding classical solutions describing
the (f,dp) bound states. in section 4 we use the boundary state to compute the
interaction energy between two (f,dp) bound states and show the validity of the
no-force condition at the string level. in section 5 we consider in more detail the
case p = 1 and, after introducing non vanishing asymptotic values for the scalar
elds of the type iib theory, show that our boundary state reproduces the dyonic
string solutions. finally, in section 6 we discuss the limit n  0 in which the
bound state (f,dp) reduces to a fundamental string. we conclude our paper with
two appendices containing more technical details. in appendix a, we introduce the
projectors along the massless closed string states and derive some of the formulas
used in this paper, while in appendix b by performing a t-duality transformation
we obtain the boundary state corresponding to the bound states (w,dp) between
kaluza-klein waves and dp branes recently discussed in ref. [10].

2 the boundary state with an external eld and

the d-brane eective action

in this section we are going to briey review the construction of the boundary state
for a d-brane with an external eld f on its world-volume. we then show how to
use this boundary state to derive the d-brane low-energy eective action.

2.1 the boundary state with an external eld

in the closed string operator formalism the supersymmetric dp branes of type
ii theories are described by means of boundary states |bi [14, 15]. these are
closed string states which insert a boundary on the world-sheet and enforce on it
the appropriate boundary conditions. both in the ns-ns and in the r-r sectors,
there are two possible implementations for the boundary conditions of a dp brane
which correspond to two boundary states |b, i, with  = 1. however, only the
combinations

and

|bins =

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

are selected by the gso projection in the ns-ns and in the r-r sectors respectively.
as discussed in ref. [3], the boundary state |b, i is the product of a matter part
and a ghost part

where

|b, i =

tp
2 |bmat, i|bg, i ,

|bmat, i = |bxi|b, i

,

|bg, i = |bghi|bsgh, i .

the overall normalization tp can be unambiguously xed from the factorization of
amplitudes of closed strings emitted from a disk [16, 5] and is the brane tension [17]

tp = (cid:16)2(cid:17)3p

.

(2.5)

the explicit expressions of the various components of |bi have been given in ref. [3]
in the case of a static d-brane without any external eld on its world-volume.
however, the operator structure of the boundary state does not change even when
more general congurations are considered and is always of the form

|bxi = exp(cid:20)

xn=1

n

n  s  n(cid:21)|bxi(0)

(2.6)

and

|b, ins = i exp(cid:20)i 

xm=1/2

m  s  m(cid:21) |0i

for the ns-ns sector, and

|b, ir =  exp(cid:20)i 

xm=1

m  s  m(cid:21)|b, i(0)

r

(2.7)

(2.8)

for the r-r sector 2. the matrix s and the zero-mode contributions |bxi(0) and
|b, i(0)
r encode all information about the overlap equations that the string coor-
dinates have to satisfy, which in turn depend on the boundary conditions of the
open strings ending on the dp brane. since the ghost and superghost elds are
not aected by the type of boundary conditions that are imposed, the ghost part
of the boundary state is always the same. its explicit expression can be found in
ref. [3]. we do not write it again here since it will not play any signicant role
for our present purposes. however, we would like to recall that the boundary state
must be written in the (1,1) superghost picture in the ns-ns sector, and in the
asymmetric (1/2,3/2) picture in the r-r in order to saturate the superghost
number anomaly of the disk [18, 3].

when a constant gauge eld f is present on the d-brane world-volume, the

overlap conditions that the boundary state must satisfy are [14]

for the fermionic part. in these equations, the greek indices , , . . . label the world-
volume directions 0, 1, . . . , p along which the dp brane extends, while the latin
indices i, j, . . . label the transverse directions p + 1, . . . , 9; moreover f = 2f . as
already noticed in ref. [14], these equations are solved by the coherent states
(2.6)-(2.8) with a matrix s given by

(2.10)

(2.11)

s =(cid:16)[(  f )( + f )1] ; ij(cid:17)

2the unusual phases introduced in eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) will turn out to be convenient to study
the couplings of the massless closed string states with a d-brane and to nd the correspondence
with the classical d-brane solutions obtained from supergravity. note that these phases are instead
irrelevant when one computes the interactions between two d-branes.

1 + i

|b, i(0)

u!ab |ai | bi

(2.12)

(2.13)

for the r sector. in writing these formulas we have denoted by yi the position of
the d-brane, by c the charge conjugation matrix and by u the following matrix

u =

1

q det( + f )

; exp(cid:16) 

1
2

f(cid:17);

(2.14)

where the symbol ;
; means that one has to expand the exponential and then
antisymmetrize the indices of the -matrices. finally, |ai | bi stands for the spinor
vacuum of the r-r sector 3.
we would like to remark that the overlap equations (2.9) and (2.10) do not allow
to determine the overall normalization of the boundary state, and not even to get
the born-infeld prefactor of eq. (2.12). the latter was derived in ref. [14]. it can
also more easily be obtained by boosting the boundary state and then performing
a t-duality as explicitly shown in ref. [19]. notice that this prefactor is present
only in the ns-ns component of the boundary state because in the r-r sector it
cancels out if we use the explicit expression for the matrix u given in eq. (2.14).

we end this subsection with a few comments. if f is an external magnetic eld,
the corresponding boundary state describes a stable bps bound state formed by a
dp brane with other lower dimensional d-branes (like for example the dp-d(p 2)
bound state). this case was explicitly considered in ref. [5] where the long distance
behavior of the massless elds of these congurations was determined using the
boundary state approach. on the contrary, if f is an external electric eld, then
the boundary state describes a stable bound state between a fundamental string
and a dp brane that preserves one half of the space-time supersymmetries [6, 7, 8].
this kind of bound state denoted by (f,dp) is a generalization of the dyonic string
congurations of schwarz [13] which has recently been studied from the supergravity
point of view [9, 10] and will be analyzed in detail in the following sections. however,
before doing this, for completeness we show how the low-energy eective action of
a d-brane is related to the boundary state we have just constructed.

3for our conventions on -matrices, spinors etc. see for example refs. [5, 3].

2.2 the d-brane eective action

as we have mentioned before, the boundary state is the exact conformal description
of a d-brane and therefore it contains the complete information about the inter-
actions between a d-brane and the closed strings that propagate in the bulk. in
particular it encodes the couplings with the bulk massless elds which can be simply
obtained by saturating the boundary state |bi with the massless states of the closed
string spectrum. in order to nd a non-vanishing result, it is necessary to soak up
the superghost number anomaly of the disk and thus, as a consequence of the su-
perghost charge of the boundary state, we have to use closed string states in the
(1,1) picture in the ns-ns sector and states in the asymmetric (1/2,3/2)
picture in the r-r sector.

in the ns-ns sector, the states that represent the graviton h, the dilaton 

and the kalb-ramond antisymmetric tensor a are of the form

the graviton

(2.22)

where in the second line we have used the antisymmetry of a.

we now show that the couplings jh, j and ja are precisely the ones that are
produced by the dirac-born-infeld action which governs the low-energy dynamics
of the d-brane. in the string frame, this action reads as follows

sdbi = 

tp

 zvp+1

(2.23)

where 22 = (2)7()4g2
s is newtons constant (gs being the string coupling), and
g and a are respectively the pullbacks of the space-time metric and of the
ns-ns antisymmetric tensor on the d-brane world volume.

in order to compare the couplings described by this action with the ones obtained
from the boundary state, it is rst necessary to rewrite sdbi in the einstein frame.
in fact, like any string amplitude computed with the operator formalism, also the
couplings jh, j and ja are written in the einstein frame (this property has been
overlooked in the qualitative analysis of ref. [7]). furthermore, it is also convenient
to introduce canonically normalized elds. these two goals can be realized by means
of the following eld redenitions

g = e/2 g

,  = 2   , a = 2  e/2 a

.

using the new elds in eq. (2.23), we easily get

sdbi = 

tp

 zvp+1

dp+1 e  (3p)

i .

by expanding the metric around the at background

g =  + 2 h

,

7

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

and keeping only the terms which are linear in h,  and a, the action (2.25) reduces
to the following expression

sdbi   tpzvp+1

dp+1r deth + fi (h( + f )1i

22 h3  p + tr(cid:16) f ( + f )1(cid:17)i  +

2h( + f )1i

a) .

h

(2.27)

it is now easy to see that the couplings with the graviton, the dilaton and the
kalb-ramond eld that can be obtained from this action are exactly the same as
those obtained from the boundary state and given in eqs. (2.20), (2.21) and (2.22)
respectively.

let us now turn to the r-r sector. as we mentioned above, in this sector
we have to use states in the asymmetric (1/2,3/2) picture in order to soak
up the superghost number anomaly of the disk. in the more familiar symmetric
(1/2,1/2) picture the massless states are associated to the eld strengths of the
r-r potentials. on the contrary, in the (1/2,3/2) picture the massless states
are associated directly to the r-r potentials which, in form notation, we denote by

c(n) =

1
n!

c1...n dx1  . . .  dxn

(2.28)

with n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 in the type iia theory and n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 in the type
iib theory. the string states |c(n)i representing these potentials have a rather
non-trivial structure. in fact, as shown in ref. [3], the natural expression

(2.29)

|c(n)i 

1
n!

c1...n (cid:18)c1...n 1 + 11

2

(cid:19)ab |a; k/2i1/2 |eb; gk/2i3/2

is brst invariant only if the potential is pure gauge. to avoid this restriction, in
general it is necessary to add to eq. (2.29) a whole series of terms with the same
structure but with dierent contents of superghost zero-modes. however, in the
present situation there exists a short-cut that considerably simplies the analysis.
in fact, one can use the incomplete states (2.29) and ignore the superghosts, whose
contribution can then be recovered simply by changing at the end the overall nor-
malizations of the amplitudes 5. keeping this in mind, the couplings between the
r-r potentials (2.28) and the dp brane can therefore be obtained by computing the
overlap between the states (2.29) and the r-r component of the boundary state,
namely

jc(n)  hc(n)|bir .

(2.30)

the evaluation of jc(n) is straightforward, even if a bit lengthy; some details about
this calculation are given in appendix a where the complete expression for the

5note that this procedure is not allowed when the odd-spin structure contributes, see ref. [3].

8

asymmetric r-r states is used and the contribution of the superghosts is explicitly
taken into account to obtain the correct normalization. the nal result is

jc(n) = 

tp

162 n!

vp+1 c1...n tr(cid:16)n...10    p ; e 1

f

;(cid:17) .

(2.31)

it is easy to realize that the trace in this equation is non-vanishing only if n =
p + 1  2, where  denotes the power of f which is produced by expanding the
exponential term. due to the antisymmetrization ;
; prescription, the integer 
takes only a nite number of values up to a maximum max which is p/2 for the
type iia string and (p + 1)/2 for the type iib string. the simplest term to
compute, corresponding to  = 0, describes the coupling of the boundary state with
a (p + 1)-form potential of the r-r sector and is given by

jc(p+1) =

2 tp
(p + 1)!

vp+1 c0...p 0...p

(2.32)

where 0...p is the completely antisymmetric tensor on the d-brane world-volume 6.
from eq. (2.32) we can immediately deduce that the charge p of a dp brane with
respect to the r-r potential c(p+1) is

p = 2 tp

(2.33)

in agreement with polchinskis original calculation [2].

the next term in the expansion of the exponential of eq. (2.31) corresponds to
 = 1 and yields the coupling of the dp brane with a (p  1)-form potential which
is given by

by proceeding in the same way, one can easily evaluate also the higher order terms
generated by the exponential which describe the interactions of the d-brane with
potential forms of lower degree. all these couplings can be encoded in the following
wess-zumino-like term

swz = p zvp+1
maxx=0

c(p+12)  e fp+1

(2.35)

f d  d , and c(n) is the pullback of the n-form potential (2.28)
where f = 1
2
on the d-brane world-volume. the square bracket in eq. (2.35) means that in
expanding the exponential form one has to pick up only the terms of total degree
(p + 1), which are then integrated over the (p + 1)-dimensional world-volume.

6our convention is that 0...p = 0...p = 1.

jc(p1) =

(2.34)

in conclusion we have explicitly shown that by projecting the boundary state
|bi with an external eld onto the massless states of the closed string spectrum,
one can reconstruct the linear part of the low-energy eective action of a dp brane.
this is the sum of the dirac-born-infeld part (2.27) and the (anomalous) wess-
zumino term (2.35) which are produced respectively by the ns-ns and the r-r
components of the boundary state.

3 (f,dp) bound states from the boundary state

in this section we are going to show that the boundary state constructed before
can be used to obtain the long distance behavior of the various elds describing
the bound state (f,dp) formed by a fundamental string and a dp brane. this
type of bound state is a generalization of the dyonic string solution of schwarz [13]
and has been recently discussed from the supergravity point of view [9, 10]. as
we mentioned before, the (f,dp) bound state can be obtained from a dp brane by
turning on an electric eld f on its world volume [6, 7, 8]. with no loss in generality
we can choose f to have non vanishing components only in the directions x 0 and
x 1 so that it can be represented by the following (p + 1)  (p + 1) matrix

f =

.

(3.1)



0 f

using this expression in eq. (2.11) one can easily see that the longitudinal part of
the matrix s appearing in the boundary state is given by

s =

(3.2)

while the transverse part of s is simply minus the identity in the remaining (9 p)
directions. furthermore, using eq. (3.1) one nds

 det(cid:16) + f(cid:17) = 1  f 2 .

10

(3.3)

as we have discussed in ref. [5], the boundary state can be used in a very ecient
way to obtain the long distance behavior of the elds emitted by a d-brane and
obtain the corresponding classical solution at long distances. to do so one simply
adds a closed string propagator d to the boundary state b and then projects the
resulting expression onto the various massless states of the closed string spectrum.
according to this procedure, the long-distance uctuation of a eld  is then given
by

(3.4)
where hp ()| denotes the projector associated to . the explicit expressions for
these projectors can be found in appendix a (see eqs.(a.8), (a.9), (a.10), (a.20))
for all massless elds of the ns-ns and r-r sectors.

  hp ()|d|bi

before giving the details of this calculation, we would like to make a few com-
ments. firstly, since we are not using explicitly the ghost and superghost degrees of
freedom, we must take into account their contribution by shifting appropriately the
zero-point energy and use for the closed string propagator the following expression

d =



4z|z|1

d2z

|z|2 zl0a z l0a

(3.5)

where the operators l0 and l0 depend only on the orbital oscillators and the in-
tercept is a = 1/2 in the ns-ns sector and a = 0 in the r-r sector. secondly,
since we want to describe congurations of branes with arbitrary r-r charge, we
multiply the entire boundary state by an overall factor of x. later we will see that
the consistency of the entire construction will require that x be an integer, and also
that the electric eld strength f cannot be arbitrary.

let us now begin our analysis by studying the projection (3.4) in the ns-ns
sector. since all projectors onto the ns-ns massless elds contain the following
structure

as we can see from the explicit expressions given in eqs. (a.8) - (a.10), it is rst
convenient to compute the matrix element

where k is the momentum in the transverse directions which is emitted by the
brane. notice that the matrix t  diers from the matrix j  dened in eq. (2.19)
simply by the factor of 1/k2
 coming from the insertion of the propagator, and by
the overall normalization (i.e. the factor of x).

using this result and the explicit form of the dilaton projector (a.8), after some
straightforward algebra, we nd that the long-distance behavior of the dilaton of
the (f,dp) bound state is given by

  hp ()|d|bins =

using the explicit expression for the matrix t we get

using the projector (a.10) for the antisymmetric kalb-ramond eld, we nd

a  hp (a)

 |d|bins =

1

2(cid:16)t  t(cid:17) .

(3.10)

since with our choices the matrix t is symmetric except in the block of the 0 and
1 directions (see eq. (3.2)), we immediately conclude that the only non-vanishing
component of the kalb-ramond eld emitted by the (f,dp) bound state is a01
whose long-distance behavior is given by

let us now turn to the r-r sector.

in this case, after the insertion of the
closed string propagator, we have to saturate the r-r boundary state (2.2) with the
projectors on the various r-r massless elds given in eq. (a.20). this calculation is
completely analogous to the one described in the previous section and performed in
detail in appendix a to obtain the couplings of a dp brane with the r-r potentials.

12

the only new features are the overall factor of x and the presence of the factor of
1/k2
 produced by the closed string propagator. due to the structure of the r-
r component of the boundary state describing the bound state (f,dp), it is not
dicult to realize that the only projectors of the form (a.20) that can give a non
vanishing result are those corresponding to a (p + 1)-form and to a (p  1)-form
with all indices along the world-volume directions. in particular, we nd that the
long distance behavior of the (p + 1)-form is given by

c01p  hp (c)

01p| d |bir = p

vp+1
k2


x .

(3.14)

similarly, given our choice of the external eld, we nd that the only non van-
ishing component of the (p 1)-form emitted by the boundary state is c23p whose
long-distance behavior turns out to be

c23p  hp (c)

23p| d |bir = p

vp+1
k2


x f .

(3.15)

notice that if p = 1 this expression has to be interpreted as the long-distance
behavior of the r-r scalar which is usually denoted by .

in all our previous analysis, the two parameters x and f that appear in the
boundary state seem to be arbitrary. however, this is not so at a closer inspection.
in fact, they are strictly related to the electric charges of the (f,dp) conguration
under the kalb-ramond eld and the r-r (p + 1)-form potential 7. it is well-known
that these charges must obey the dirac quantization condition, i.e. they must be
integer multiples of the fundamental unit of (electric) charge of a p-dimensional
extended object p. in our notations this quantization condition amounts to impose
that the coecients of p
in eqs. (3.11) and (3.14) be integer numbers (see
also section 5 for a discussion of this issue) 8. this implies that

vp+1
k2


x = n

and 

xf

1  f 2

= m

(3.16)

with n and m two integers. while the restriction on x had to be expected from the
very beginning because x simply represents the number of dp branes (and hence of
boundary states) that form the bound state, the restriction on the external eld f
is less trivial. in fact, from eq. (3.16) we see that f must be of the following form

f = 

m

n2 + m2

.

(3.17)

7notice that these charges are indeed of electric type since the only non-vanishing components

of the corresponding potentials have an index along the time direction.

8this particular choice of signs is of course just a matter of convention; as we will see it leads

to the results that are usually reported in the literature.

13

this is precisely the same expression that appears in the analysis of ref. [7] on the
dyonic string congurations, and is also consistent with the results of ref. [9, 10].
using eq. (3.16), we can now rewrite the long distance behavior of the massless
elds produced by a (f,dp) bound state in a more suggestive way. in doing so,
we also perform a fourier transformation to work in conguration space. this is
readily computed by observing that, for p < 7, one has

z d(p+1)x d(9p)y

eiky

(7  p) r7p 8p

=

vp+1
k2


(3.18)

where q = 2(q+1)/2/((q + 1)/2) is the area of a unit q-dimensional sphere and
r2 = yiyi measures the distance from the branes. for later convenience, we also
introduce the following notations

and

qp = p

m,n = m2 + n2

2  1/2
(7  p) 8p

m,n

(3.19)

(3.20)

.

then, using eq. (3.9) and assuming for the time being that the dilaton has vanishing
vacuum expectation value, after some elementary steps, we obtain that the long-
distance behavior of the dilaton is

 = 2    

n2 (p  3) + 2 m2

4 m,n

qp
r7p

.

(3.21)

since we are going to compare our results with the standard supergravity description
of d-branes, we have reintroduced the eld  which diers from the canonically
normalized dilaton  by a factor of 2  (see also eq. (2.24)). similarly, recalling
that g =  + 2 h, from eq. (3.13) we nd

g00 = g11  1 +

g22 = . . . = gpp  1 +

rescaling the kalb-ramond eld by a factor of 2  to obtain the standard super-

ba = 2 a

m,n

14

(3.23)

finally, repeating the same steps for the r-r potentials (3.14) and (3.15) we nd

bc(p1) = 2 c(p1)

(3.25)

and

eqs. (3.21)-(3.25) represent the leading long-distance behavior of the massless elds
emitted by the (f,dp) bound state. it is reasonable to expect that by inserting more
boundaries on the closed string world-sheet, i.e. by introducing more boundary
states, one can perturbatively reconstruct the exact brane-solution of the super-
gravity eld equations. actually, this fact has been recently checked in ref. [21] for
the case of a single d-brane, even if with a dierent formalism. we then assume
that this is indeed what happens also in our case, and that the exact solution can
be written in terms of powers of the usual harmonic function

and also of the new harmonic function

(3.26)

(3.27)

introduced in ref. [10]. under this assumption, from eqs. (3.21)-(3.25) we can
infer that in the exact brane-solution corresponding to the (f,dp) bound state the
dilaton is

e = h 1/2 h (5p)/4 ,

(3.28)

the metric is

ds2 = h 3/4 h (p1)/8(cid:20)(cid:16)dx0(cid:17)2
+ h 1/4 h (p9)/8(cid:20)(cid:16)dx2(cid:17)2

+    + (dxp)2(cid:21)
+    +(cid:16)dx9(cid:17)2(cid:21) ,

the kalb-ramond 2-form is

m
1/2

m,n (cid:16)h 1  1(cid:17) dx0  dx1 ,

ba =

and nally the r-r potentials are

15

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

and

bc(p1) = 

m

n (cid:16)h 1  1(cid:17) dx2      dxp .

notice that the eld strength associated to bc(p+1) is electric, whereas the one asso-
ciated to bc(p1) is magnetic. in the case p = 1, the last equation has to be replaced

by

(3.32)

(3.33)

 = 

m

n (cid:16)h 1  1(cid:17)

where  is the r-r scalar eld also called axion.

in writing this solution we have assumed that all elds except the metric have
vanishing asymptotic values. this explains why we have subtracted the 1 in the
last four equations. our solution exactly agrees with the one recently derived in
ref. [10] from the supergravity point of view 9. moreover, eq. (3.33) can be shown
to exactly agree with the axion eld of the dyonic string solution of schwarz [13] in
the case of vanishing asymptotic background values for the scalars (0 = 0 = 0).

4 interaction between two (f,dp) bound states

we now analyze some properties of the (f,dp) bound states we have described in
the previous section; in particular we compute the interaction energy between two
of them both from the classical and from the string point of view. to this aim, let
us start by considering the contribution to the classical interaction energy due to
the exchange of dilatons. the coupling j of the dilaton with the boundary state
describing the (f,dp) conguration is given in eq. (2.21) with an overall factor of
n; after using eqs. (3.1) and (3.16), j explicitly becomes

j =

tp
22

vp+1

n2 (3  p)  2m2

m,n

 .

using this coupling, we can compute the potential energy density as follows

(4.3)

9actually, in comparing our results with those of ref. [10], we nd total agreement except
for the overall sign in the kalb-ramond 2-form. our sign however agrees with the dyonic string
solution of schwarz [13] when we put p = 1.

u =

[n2 (3  p)  2m2]2

m,n

vp+1
k2


.

(4.4)

notice that u is always positive, which implies that the force between two (f,dp)
bound states due to dilaton exchanges is always attractive.

let us now turn to the contribution to the potential energy due to graviton ex-
changes. the coupling of the graviton with the boundary state is given by eq. (2.20)
(again with an overall factor of n) which in our specic case becomes

jh = tp vp+1

(4.9)

notice that this gravitational potential energy is always positive (for p  7), signal-
ing the well-known fact that the exchange of gravitons always yields an attractive
force.

now let us consider the interaction between two (f,dp) bound states due to ex-
changes of kalb-ramond antisymmetric tensors. the coupling between the bound-
ary state and the kalb-ramond eld is given by eq. (2.22) with an overall factor
of n and in our present case it becomes

ja =

(4.10)

(4.12)

is the propagator of an antisymmetric 2-index tensor in the lorentz gauge. using
the explicit form (4.6) of the matrix v and inserting eq. (4.12) into eq. (4.11), we
nd

ua = 2 t 2

p m2 vp+1
k2


.

(4.13)

notice that ua is always negative meaning that the corresponding force is always
repulsive. this is indeed what should happen because the (f,dp) bound state
carries the electric charge of the kalb-ramond eld, and two alike charges always
repel each other.

finally, we compute the interaction energy density due to the exchange of the
r-r potentials. in the case of the top (electric) form c(p+1), the coupling with the
boundary state is given by eq. (2.32) multiplied by n and in our case it explicitly
reads

jc(p+1) = 2 tp vp+1 n c01p .

then it is immediate to realize that the potential energy density is given by

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

uc(p+1) =

1

jc(p+1) jc(p+1)
vp+1
{z

{z

=

c01p c01p

{z

which is the obvious generalization of eq. (4.12). since uc(p+1) is negative, the
corresponding force is repulsive as it should be, since the (f,dp) bound states carry
the same electric charge under the (p + 1)-form potential. in a similar way, we can
compute the contribution to the interaction due to the exchange of the magnetic
r-r potentials c(p1). in this case the coupling with the boundary state, which we
can read from eq. (2.34) with an overall factor of n, is

jc(p1) = 2 tp vp+1

mn
1/2
m,n

c23p

(4.17)

and hence, the corresponding potential energy density turns out to be

notice that this last contribution is positive so that the associated force is always
attractive as it should be for the exchange of abelian potentials of magnetic type.
it is interesting to observe that not all the ns-ns (or r-r) massless elds con-
tribute with the same sign to the interaction energy between two (f,dp) bound
states. this is to be compared with what happens with simple d-branes, where
the distinction between attractive and repulsive contributions coincides with the
distinction between the ns-ns and r-r sectors.

in order to compute the mass density, or the tension, of the (f,dp) bound states,
we follow polchinskis approach [17], namely we consider the total attractive poten-
tial energy and then compare it with newtons law in d = 10 for two p-dimensional
extended objects 10. if we sum u, uh and uc(p1) , remarkable simplications occur
yielding

uattr = u + uh + uc(p1) = 2 t 2

p m,n

.

(4.20)

vp+1
k2


performing a fourier transformation and using eq. (3.18), we get

uattr(r) =

2 t 2
p m,n
(7  p) 8p

1

r7p

(4.21)

where r is the distance between the two bound states. on the other hand, newtons
law for two p-dimensional extended objects of mass density mp in d = 10 reads

u(r) =

22 m 2
p

(7  p) 8p

1

r7p

(4.22)

where 22 is newtons constant. by comparing eqs. (4.21) and (4.22) we conclude
that

mp =

tp 1/2
m,n

(4.23)

1


10in the case of simple dp branes this amounts to consider just the contribution of the ns-ns
sector; in our case however, we cannot use this identication since in the ns-ns sector there is a
repulsive contribution and an attractive contribution appears in the r-r sector.

19

so that the tension of the (f,dp) bound state is

t (m, n) = tp 1/2

m,n = tp m2 + n2 .

(4.24)

this formula agrees with the one obtained in refs. [9, 10] with adm considerations,
and explicitly shows that the (f,dp) conguration is a non-threshold bound state
between a fundamental string of charge m and a dp brane of charge n (in units of
p). it also makes evident the fact that elementary bound states are realized if m
and n are relative prime integers.

if we now compute the total energy density, we nd a vanishing result, i.e.

utot = u + uh + ua + uc(p+1) + uc(p1) = 0

(4.25)

meaning that the (f,dp) bound states are bps congurations satisfying the no-
force condition. actually, this property can be proved at the full string level by
computing the vacuum amplitude between two boundary states at a distance r
from each other, which is dened by

 = hb| d |bi

(4.26)

where d is the closed string propagator (3.5). (the explicit form of the conjugate
boundary state that has to be used in eq. (4.26) can be found at the end of appendix
a.) then following the standard methods explained in ref. [3], it is not dicult to
check that the ns-ns contribution to  is

ns =

similarly, one can show that the r-r contribution to  is

the abstruse identity satised by the f -functions implies that  = ns + r = 0,
i.e. the bps condition at the full string level.

we can therefore conclude that the boundary state |bi dened in section 2 with
an external electric eld as in eq. (3.1), really provides the complete conformal
description of the bps bound states formed by fundamental strings and dp branes.

5 dyonic strings in the type iib theory

in this section we consider in more detail the (f,d1) bound states which describe
the dyonic strings rst introduced by j. schwarz in ref. [13]. let us recall that
if we set to zero the self-dual ve-form of the r-r sector, the low energy eective
action for the iib string in the einstein frame can be written as follows

siib =

1

22z d10xg(cid:20)r +

where r is the scalar curvature, m is the sl(2, r) matrix constructed out of the
dilaton  and the axion  according to

with

1 !
m = e  ||2 



 =  + i e ,

(5.2)

(5.3)

and nally f is the two-component vector f = (fns, fr) formed by the eld

strengths fns = dba and fr = dbc(2) of the two-form potentials of the ns-ns

and r-r sectors. the action (5.1) has manifest invariance under global sl(2, r)
transformations given by

where

m   m t
c d !
 =  a b

,

f  (t )1 f

with ad  bc = 1 .

(5.4)

(5.5)

more explicitly, we have

 

a + b
c + d

, fns  d fns  c fr , fr   b fns + a fr .

(5.6)

the dyonic string is a classical solution of the eld equations derived from the action
(5.1) which is (electrically) charged under the two antisymmetric tensors of the ns-
ns and r-r sectors. let us observe that if we denote by j = (jns, jr) the
current which is coupled to the antisymmetric tensors, then the charge q = (qns, qr)
of the dyonic string is dened by

q  zv8

(5.7)

where in the last step we have used stokes theorem. in these formulas v8 denotes
the space transverse to the string world-sheet whose boundary v8 is a seven di-
mensional sphere at innity. from eqs. (5.7) and (5.4) it is easy to realize that the
electric charges transform under an sl(2, r) transformation  according to

q   q .

(5.8)

as is well known, not all classical solutions are fully consistent at the quantum
level; only those which carry integer charges in units of 1 (see eq. (2.33) for p = 1)
satisfy the dirac quantization condition and are acceptable. this is precisely the
case of the (f,d1) bound state discussed in section 3. for later convenience we write
explicitly the long distance behavior of the corresponding elds obtained from the
boundary state and given in eqs. (3.21)-(3.25) for p = 1, namely

where q1 is given in eq. (3.20) for p = 1. using eq. (5.11) into eq. (5.7), and
remembering that in this case the asymptotic matrix m| is the identity, one can
easily verify that

that is, as expected, the two charges are integer multiples of 1.

qns = m 1

,

qr = n 1 ,

(5.12)

we now want to generalize these considerations to the case in which the two
scalar elds  and  have non vanishing asymptotic values 0 and 0 respectively.
this can be easily achieved by exploiting the sl(2, r) invariance of the theory
and rotating the solution given in eqs. (5.9)-(5.11) by means of the following
transformation

 =  e0/2 0 e0/2

e0/2 ! .

0

indeed, according to eq. (5.6) we have

  e =  + 0

,

  e = e0  + 0 ,

so that the transformed elds acquire the desired asymptotic values. furthermore,
under  the antisymmetric tensors transform as follows

ba01  ea01 = e0/2 ba01

,

bc01  ec01 = e0/2 bc01  0 e0/2 ba01 ,

22

(5.15)

and correspondingly the charges become

qns  eqns = e0/2 qns + 0 e0/2 qr

,

qr  eqr = e0/2 qr .

the new conguration is acceptable only if the new charges eqns and eqr obey the

dirac quantization condition. from eq. (5.16) we easily see that this condition is
realized if we start from a conguration like the one of eq. (5.11) but with m and
n replaced according to

(5.16)

m  e0/2 (m  0 n)

, n  e0/2 n .

(5.17)

in view of the discussion of section 3, we can say that this conguration can be
obtained from a boundary state with an external eld on it given by

where

ef = 

e0/2 (m  0 n)

m,n

e1/2

em,n = e0 (m  0 n)2 + e0 n2 .

notice that these expressions are simply obtained from eqs. (3.17) and (3.19) with

the substitutions (5.17). furthermore, we remark that ef is precisely the gauge eld

found in ref. [7] with dierent considerations.

performing the transformations on the massless elds as indicated in eqs. (5.14)

and (5.15), we nally obtain the following long distance behavior for the scalars

6 concluding remarks

in this paper we have shown that the boundary state with a constant electric eld
provides the complete conformal representation for the bps bound states formed
by a fundamental string and a dp brane. at the classical level, these congurations
interpolate between the pure fundamental string and the pure dp brane. in fact
the latter can be obtained by setting f = 0 (or equivalently m = 0), while the
fundamental string is realized by choosing f = 1 (or equivalently n = 0) in
eqs.(3.21)-(3.25).

one may wonder whether the same interpolation can be done at the full confor-
mal level, i.e. directly on the boundary state. while there is of course no problem
in switching o the electric eld to obtain the boundary state for a pure dp brane,
the other limit, f  1 (or equivalently n  0), is singular and not well dened on
the boundary state. the reason is that the dirac-born-infeld prefactor n1  f 2

vanishes in this limit, while the longitudinal part of the s matrix (see eq. (3.2))
diverges. however, these two eects compensate each other whenever the bound-
ary state is saturated with closed string states which contain at most one left and
one right oscillator with longitudinal index. this is precisely the structure of the
massless states of the ns-ns sector. using this observation and the fact that the
r-r sector does not play any role in the fundamental string solution, we can intro-
duce an eective operator which generates the classical fundamental string in the
same way as the boundary state does for the d brane. such operator is equal in
structure to a boundary state without r-r sector and with a ns-ns sector dened
by a longitudinal (2  2) s matrix given by

s =  2 2
2 !

2

(6.1)

and no transverse s matrix. this eective operator is perfectly well dened and,
when it is projected onto the dilaton, the graviton and the antisymmetric tensor,
it yields the fundamental string solution. furthermore, it appears to describe a
bps object, because the vacuum amplitude between two such states is identically
vanishing. therefore, it can be considered as an eective conformal representa-
tion of the fundamental string which is valid at very large distances, i.e. only for
the massless elds. however, it cannot be the complete conformal description of
the fundamental string solution.
in fact, a coherent state  structure, like the
one given for instance in eq. (2.6), always enforces an identication between left
and right oscillators, which is appropriate only when the string world sheet has
a boundary; this is certainly not the case for the pure fundamental string which
only couples to closed string states and therefore must have independent left and

24

right sectors. finding the complete conformal description of the fundamental string
remains therefore an open problem.

let us now consider the massless states of the r-r sector. as we mentioned in
section 2, in order to have a non vanishing overlap with the boundary state, we
must work in the asymmetric (1/2,3/2) picture so that the superghost number
anomaly of the disk is soaked up.
in eq. (2.29) we wrote an expression for the
state representing a n-form r-r potential c(n). however, that expression has to be
interpreted as an eective and simplied description which can be used only when
parity violating terms do not contribute to scattering amplitudes. the complete
expression for the massless r-r states instead involves innite terms with dierent
superghost number which combine to give [3]

|c(n)i =

c1...n" (c1...n+)ab cos(0e0)

+ (c1...n)ab sin(0e0)#|a; k/2i1/2 |eb; gk/2i3/2

(a.12)

where  = (1  11)/2, and 0 and 0 are the superghost zero-modes. the
corresponding conjugate state is

hc(n)| = 1/2heb, gk/2| 3/2ha, k/2|" (c1...n)ab cos(0e0)

+ (c1...n+)ab sin(0e0)# (1)n

22 n!

c1...n .

(a.13)

we now show that these states are correctly normalized. due to the presence of
the superghost zero modes, the norm hc(n)|c(n)i is naively divergent and a suitable
regularization is necessary [22, 3]. this can be performed by inserting in the scalar
product the operator x2f0200, where f0 is the zero-mode part of the world-sheet

26

fermion number, and letting x  1 at the end. keeping this in mind, let us rst
compute the superghost contribution. using the equation

we can easily obtain

and also check that analogous expressions with one sine and one cosine are vanishing.

then, recalling that the fermionic vacua are such that ha|bi = hea|ebi = (c 1)ab,

we get

using the transposition properties of the  matrices and exploiting eqs. (a.15) and
(a.16), after some simple algebra we obtain

this result shows that the state (a.12) is canonically normalized. now we can
dene the projection operator associated to |c(n)i which turns out to be

repeating the same steps described before, one can check that indeed

hp (c)

1...n|c(n)i = c1...n .

(a.21)

let us now compute the overlap of hp (c)| with the r-r boundary state. since the
projector (a.21) contains only zero-modes, it is enough to consider the zero-mode
part of the r-r boundary state, which is explicitly given by [3]

if the indices 1 . . . n are all along the world-volume of the dp-brane (which is pre-
cisely the case of interest in this paper), then the term containing 11 in eq.(a.27)
vanishes; therefore, taking the limit x  1 and observing that n and p must have

appendix b

in this appendix we show how to derive from the boundary state the classical
solution corresponding to the bound state (w,dp) between a kaluza-klein wave w
and a dp brane. the (w,dp) bound state can be easily obtained from a (f,dp+1)
conguration by performing a t-duality along the longitudinal spatial direction of
the fundamental string (i.e. along x 1 in our conventions). as shown in ref. [5],

29





. . .

1

a t-duality transformation in a given direction is simply realized by changing the
sign in the corresponding row of the s matrix which denes the boundary state.
therefore, in our case, we can start from the (p + 2) (p + 2) longitudinal s matrix
of the (f,d(p + 1)) conguration given in eq. (3.2), and then change the sign of the
second row corresponding to x 1 to get

(b.1)

s =

notice that the matrix (b.1) is symmetric, as opposed to the one of eq. (3.2) which
is antisymmetric.

following the same procedure described in section 3, we can obtain the long
distance behavior of the massless elds emitted by the (w,dp) bound state. for
simplicity, we will concentrate on the massless elds of the ns-ns sector. when
written in terms of t (see eq. (3.7)), the long distance behavior of these elds
is formally equal to the one of the (f,dp+1) bound state and is given by eqs.
(3.8), (3.10) and (3.12). however, since the new matrix t is symmetric, we can
immediately conclude the no kalb-ramond eld is emitted by the (w,dp) bound
state. on the contrary, there is an o-diagonal component in t which gives rise
to an o-diagonal component in the metric. this is the distinctive feature of this
conguration.

writing the boundary state with the matrix (b.1) where the external eld f
is given by eq. (3.17), and performing a fourier transformation, we then get the
following long distance behavior for the dilaton

using these expressions and assuming that the complete solution of the (w,dp)
bound state can be written in terms of the harmonic functions h and h  dened in
eqs. (3.26) and (3.27) (with p replaced by (p + 1)), we can infer that the dilaton is

e = h (3p)/4 ,

(b.4)

and the metric is

ds2 =  h 1 h (p+1)/8(cid:16)dx0(cid:17)2

+ h h (p7)/8(cid:16)dx1 + a0 dx0(cid:17)2

where the kaluza-klein vector potential a0 is

a0 =

m,n (cid:16)h 1  1(cid:17) .

(b.5)

(b.6)

this solution agrees with the one presented in ref. [10], except that our kaluza-
klein vector has a dierent sign and a vanishing asymptotic value. for the r-r
potentials, after performing the t-duality, one proceeds as we discussed in sec-
tion 3 and obtains two r-r (p+1)-forms, one of electric type and one of magnetic
type, whose expressions are similar to those of eqs. (3.31) and (3.32) with obvious
changes.
