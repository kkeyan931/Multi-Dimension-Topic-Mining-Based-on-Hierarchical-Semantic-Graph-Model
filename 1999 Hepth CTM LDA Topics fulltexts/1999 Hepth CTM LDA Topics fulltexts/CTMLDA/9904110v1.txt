abstract

a closed universe containing pressureless dust, more generally
perfect uid matter with pressure-to-density ratio w in the range
( 1
3 , 1
3), violates holographic principle applied according to the
fischler-susskind proposal. we show, rst for a class of two-uid
solutions and then for the general multiuid case, that the closed
universe will obey the holographic principle if it also contains
matter with w <  1
3, and if the present value of its total den-
sity is suciently close to the critical density. it is possible that
such matter can be realised by some form of quintessence, much
studied recently.

1. the holographic principle implies that the degrees of freedom in a
spatial region can all be encoded on its boundary, with a density not ex-
ceeding one degree of freedom per planck cell [1]. accordingly, the entropy
in a spatial region does not exceed its boundary area measured in planck
units. moreover, the physics of the bulk is describeable by the physics on the
boundary. this has, indeed, been realised recently for some anti de sitter
spaces [2].

fischler and susskind (fs) have proposed [3] how to apply the holo-
graphic principle in cosmology, and showed that our universe, if at or open,
obeys this principle as long as its size is non zero - that is, non planckian. if
closed, however, it violates this principle in the future even while its size is
non zero. in fact, in some cases, the violation occurs while the universe is still
expanding. this may indicate that closed universe is to be excluded as incon-
sistent, or some new behaviour must set in to accomodate the holographic
principle [3].

the holographic principle has since been applied in the context of pre
big bang scenario [4], singularity problem [5], and ination [6, 7], mostly for
at universe. recently, there have been two alternative proposals for the
implementation of the holographic principle: by easther and lowe, based
on second law of thermodynamics [7]; and, by bak and rey, using the cos-
mological apparent horizon instead of particle horizon [8]. in both of these
implementations, the closed universe also obeys the holographic principle
naturally. therefore, these proposals are perhaps the more natural ones
than the fs proposal.

nevertheless, it is of interest to study whether or not a closed universe is
indeed to be excluded as inconsistent with the holographic principle, applied
according to the fs proposal. we study this issue in this paper.

throughout in the following we consider a closed universe, initially of
zero size and expanding. it is assumed to contain more than one type of non
interacting perfect uid matter. the pressure pi and the density i of the ith
type of matter is related by the equation of state

pi = wii

, 1  wi  1 .

(1)

the parameter w denotes the nature of the matter: w = 0 for pressureless
dust, w = 1
3 for radiation, etc. furthermore, we assume that one of the ws,

2

say w1, lies in the range

1
3



< w1 <

1
3

(2)

so that if the corresponding matter were the only one present, then the
universe violates the holographic principle in the future (see [3]).

we study the explicit solution for the two-uid case with w1 + w2 =  2
3 .
we nd that the closed universe obeys the holographic principle throughout
its future if and only if the present value of the total density is suciently
close to the critical density.

using this solution, we show furthermore that the closed universe, con-
taining atleast one matter, with its w lying in the range (2), obeys the holo-
graphic principle, applied according to the fs proposal, if it also contains
atleast one other matter with its w satisfying w <  1
3 , and if the present
value of its total density is suciently close to the critical density. thus, the
closed universes need not be excluded as inconsistent, nor any new behaviour
needs to set in; the above requirements will suce.

if these conditions are also necessary then the holographic principle, ap-
plied according to the fs proposal, can be said to predict that if the total
density at present of our universe exceeds the critical density, no matter by
how small an amount, then it is closed and, hence, must also contain matter
with w <  1
3.
we make a few remarks about matter with negative values of w. no
known physical matter is of this type, except cosmological constant (w =
1). however, such matter, with w   1
3, was found necessary in [9] in
avoiding big bang singularity within low energy string theory. furthermore,
dirichlet - 0 and/or (1) - branes [10] were envisaged as possible candidates
for such matter. also, the recent discovery, through the analyses of distant
supernovae, that the universe is accelerating at present [11] has sparked an
enormous interest in the study of matter with w < 0. a realisation of such
matter is the so called quintessence - a time varying, spatially inhomoge-
neous component of energy density of the universe with negative pressure,
much studied recently [12, 13]. some of the references which study various
candidates for matter with negative pressure and/or quintessence are given
in [14]. it is possible that matter with w <  1
3 , required here, can be realised
by some one of the above candidates.

in the following, we rst outline how the closed universe violates the
holographic principle [3] in the future. we then present two-uid solutions,

3

and obtain the conditions underwhich the holographic principle is obeyed.
we then show that these conditions are also valid in general.

2. the line element for the homogeneous isotropic universe is given by

ds2 = dt2 + r2(t)  dr2

1  kr2 + r2d2

2! ,

where r is the scale factor, d2 is the standard line element on unit two
dimensional sphere, and k = 0,1, or +1 for at, open, or closed universe
respectively. the above line element can also be written as

ds2 = dt2 + r2(t)(d2 + r2d2

2) ,

where r = , sinh , or sin  for k = 0,1, or +1 respectively. the coordinate
size of the horizon is given by the parameter

 = z t

0

dt
r

.

the holographic bound is given, upto numerical factors of o(1), by s  a
where s is the entropy in a given region and a is the area of its boundary in
planck units [1]. applied to the closed universe according to fs proposal, it
implies, upto numerical factors of o(1), that
(2  sin 2)

(3)

=

s
a

r2 sin2 

 1 ,

where  is the constant comoving entropy density [3].

for a closed universe, initially of zero size and expanding, and containing

only one type of matter with w >  1

3 , one obtains [15], see below also,

r1+3w  sin2 1 + 3w
it can be seen that if w  1
3 , then the fs bound (3) will be violated only
when r  0, which is the planckian regime. however, if  1
3 < w < 1
3 ,
then the fs bound (3) will be violated as   . the violation occurs even
while r is non zero.
in fact, when w  0, the violation occurs while the

(4)

universe is still expanding. this may indicate that such universes are to be
excluded as inconsistent, or some new behaviour must set in to accomodate
the holographic principle, applied according to the fs proposal [3].

3. the above conclusion is valid if the universe contains one type of
matter only. in reality, however, more than one type of matter will be present
in various, perhaps subdominant, quantities. it is then important to study
such multiuid solutions before excluding closed universes as inconsistent.

the general multiuid solutions are dicult to obtain.

in a few cases
where exist [16], they typically involve elliptic functions and are often not
in a useful form. however, for a class of models, we now present general
solutions, in a form useful for our purposes.

assume that the universe contains dierent types of non interacting per-
fect uid matter, with equations of state given as in (1). we assume, without
loss of generality, that wi 6=  1
3 since the eect of such matter is same as
that of the k-term in equation (5) below. also, dene

where 0i (6= 0), is the present value of i, c is the critical density, g is the
newtons constant, and h0 is the present value of the hubble parameter.
einsteins equations of motion can then be written as

throughout in the following, let w1 lie in the range given in (2). thus,
if the corresponding matter were the only one present, then the universe

note that c1 = 1. the function f (r) in (5), expressed in terms of y, becomes
f (r) = yg(y).

from now on, we set k = +1. if q = a = 1 then (, 1) = (2, 0), and
the solution (4) for the single uid case [15] follows trivially. consider two-
uid cases: i = 1, 2. the boundary conditions, corresponding to an universe,
initially of zero size and expanding, are r = y = 0 and r > 0 at t = x = 0.

it follows from the above expressions that

hence, in a closed universe with both radiation and dust present, the fs
bound (3) will be violated even while r (= r|=) is non zero. this is true
irrespective of the amount of radiation present, however large it may be.
only when d = 0 exactly, will the fs bound (3) be obeyed all the way until
r = 0, i.e. until the universe recollapses to zero size.

solutions also. namely, the fs bound (3) will be obeyed if

further restrictions on {wi}, i = 1, 2,   . then, the function

this can be proved as follows. let the multiuid system contain atleast

10

we now consider an auxiliary two-uid system, with the corresponding

function given by

h(r)  xj=1,2

j (cid:18) r

r0(cid:19)(1+3 wj )

,

(26)

where the tildes refer to the auxiliary system. by a simple, but slightly
involved, analysis it can be shown that the parameters wj and j, j = 1, 2,
can be chosen 1 such that (1 + 3 w1) = (1 + 3 w2) > 0 and

h(r) > h(r) ,

0  r   .

the parameter h0r0, taken to be the same for both systems, is given by (see
equation (7))

the solution for the auxiliary system is nothing but the one given in the

and similarly for f (r) and . since h(r) > h(r) and h0r0 is same for both

however, it is shown in the previous section that  <  if c is suciently
large. therefore, it now follows that the parameter

and, hence, the fs bound (3) is obeyed in the future, if (pi i  1), which

must be positive, is suciently small; that is, if the present value of the total
density is suciently close to the critical density.

1for example, choose w1 such that min{|1 + 3wi|} > 1 + 3 w1 > 0, and js such that
h(r) also has its non zero, and the only, minimum at r = rm and h(rm) > h(rm) > 0,
where the inequalities are obeyed by sucient margins.

11

we have thus shown that the closed universe, containing atleast one mat-
ter, with its w lying in the range (2), obeys the holographic principle, applied
according to the fs proposal, if it also contains atleast one other matter with
its w satisfying w <  1
3 , and if the present value of its total density is suf-
ciently close to the critical density. thus, the closed universes need not be
excluded as inconsistent, nor any new behaviour needs to set in; the above
requirements will suce.

if these conditions are also necessary, then they can be taken as predic-
tions of holographic principle, applied to the closed universe according to the
fs proposal. thus, if the total density at present of our universe, which cer-
tainly contains pressureless dust, exceeds the critical density, no matter by
how small an amount, then it is closed, k = +1. the holographic principle,
applied according to tha fs proposal, would then require that our universe
must also contain matter with w <  1
3 . it is possible that such matter can
be realised by some form of quintessence, much studied recently.
