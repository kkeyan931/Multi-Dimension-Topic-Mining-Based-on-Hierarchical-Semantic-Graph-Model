abstract

we calculate the radiatively induced lorentz and cpt breaking
chern-simons term in qed, with electrons axially coupled to a con-
stant vector b, to all orders in b. this term is the integral of a
lagrangian density lk = 1
2 kfa. when lk is calculated to
the lowest non-trivial order in b, it is found that k = cb, where c
is a constant. the precise value of c is not a priori determined, due
to renormalization ambiguities. by keeping the full dependence on
b throughout the calculation, we show that c acquires a logarithmic
dependence in b2
m2 (m denoting the electron mass). for reasonable
values of b2, the logarithm will radically aect, and indeed overcome,
the conventional linear dependence. the result still has a renormal-
ization ambiguity, the xing of which would demand an extra physical
condition.

there have recently been some interesting results about the radiatively
induced lorentz and cpt breaking term 1 in quantum electrodynamics[1,
2, 3, 4, 5]. the usual setting to study this eect is to calculate the cpt odd
term generated by fermion loops, in a theory where the fermions are axially
coupled to a constant vector b, besides the usual minimal coupling to the
abelian gauge eld a. all the calculations so far have dealt with this eect
to the lowest order in b, implicitly assuming that higher powers of b should
be strongly suppressed (b must be a very small parameter). this, however,
requires the dependence of the induced term on b to be analytic. in this
letter we shall show, by keeping the full dependence on b at every step of
the calculation, that the result is non-analytic in b. this eect will of course
strongly modify the phenomenological bounds (extracted from birefringence
of an electromagnetic wave[1]) on the vector b, since its measurable eects
are taken from the radiatively induced term, which in turn is non-analytic in
b. we will calculate odd(a, b; m), the lorentz and cpt-violating piece of
(a, b; m), which is in turn dened by

exp[i (a, b; m)] = z(a, b; m) = z d d exp(is) ,

where

s = z d4x (i 6  6a  m 6 b5) ,

with b a constant vector. the term containing b breaks lorentz and cpt
symmetries explicitly.

we shall work in minkowski spacetime, with the -matrices satisfying

{, } = 2g g = diag(1, 1, 1, 1)

 =  5 = i0123 = 

5 .

(3)

as shown in [1], general considerations indicate that odd(a, b; m) has the
following structure 2

(1)

(2)

(4)

(5)

where

odd(a, b; m) = z d4x lk

lk =

kfa .

1this is sometimes called chern-simons term because it shares some properties with

the usual 2 + 1 dimensional chern-simons term.

2this object is local since one is interested in the eective low-energy corrections to

the classical maxwell action for the gauge eld a.

here k is a constant vector, parallel to b. odd(a, b; m) may be obtained
as the part of (a, b; m) which is odd under b  b. of course, to get the
eective lagrangian lk, one uses also a derivative expansion. if the calcu-
lation is performed to the rst order in b, then k and b are proportional.
in the general case, b and k will remain parallel, namely k = c b but
one would expect c to be a function of b2
m2 rather than a constant, although
with a negligible variation when b2
m2 << 1. however, we shall show that that
function has a log( b2
m2 ) dependence.

we shall see that odd(a, b; m) is logarithmically divergent. we can always
odd(a, b; m), the regulated version of odd(a, b; m), by using the

rewrite reg
trivial identity

odd(a, b; m) = reg
reg

odd(a, b; 0) + reg

odd(a, b; m)

where

reg

odd(a, b; m) = reg

odd(a, b; m)  reg

odd(a, b; 0) .

(6)

(7)

the reason for decomposing reg
odd(a, b; m) in this form is that the rst term
(the induced term for massless fermions) may be calculated exactly, by using
known results about the chiral anomaly in 3 + 1 dimensions. the term in
square brackets summarizes the eect of the massiveness of the electrons.
when taking the innite regulator limit, the rst term has a nite limit for
any gauge invariant regularization, and it is the only part of the calculation
where an indeterminacy appears. the second term has a nite limit when
the regulator is removed.

we now proceed to the calculation of (a, b; 0). as it was suggested in
[4] and implicitly said in [5], in the case of massless fermions the coupling
to b may be erased by a chiral redenition of the fermionic elds. this
transformation gives rise to an anomalous jacobian. to see this, we note
that we may write (a, b; 0) in terms of the generating functional for massless
fermions,

z(a, b; 0) = z d d exp[z d4x (i 6  6 a 6 b5)] .

(8)

an axial transformation of the fermions may be performed in order to change
the coupling to b in the action

(x)  exp[i(x)5](x)
(x)  (x) exp[i(x)5] ,

(9)

3

at the expense, however, of introducing an anomalous fujikawa jacobian [6]

z(a, b; 0) = j (, a) z(a, b  ; 0) .

this jacobian is given by

j (, a) = exp(cid:20) i

82 z d4x(x) f  f(cid:21) .

(10)

(11)

of course, to erase the coupling to b completely, we must require  to satisfy
the equation  = b, whose general solution is

(x) = bx + 0

(12)

where 0 is a constant. by using this specic form of (x), we easily see that

z(a, b, 0) = exp(cid:20)

i

82 z d4xbfa(cid:21) z(a, 0, 0) .

(13)

note that we have neglected the term proportional to 0. it can be assumed
to be zero just because 0 = 0 is a possible choice. but even for 0 6= 0, it

multiplies r f f , which vanishes for an abelian eld.

the cpt-odd part of the eective action is odd in b, thus we conclude

that it receives a contribution only from the jacobian. namely,

odd(a, b, 0) = 

1

82 z d4xbfa .

(14)

as it was pointed out in [5], there is an ambiguity in the coecient of this
chern-simons term, related to the (ambiguity in the) denition of the cur-
rent operator. we may parametrize this ambiguity in terms of an undeter-
mined coecient , such that

odd(a, b; 0) = 

1

82 (1 + )z d4x bfa .

(15)

so far, this yields the rst term in (6). now we deal with the second
term, which, as we shall see, has a nite limit when the regulator is removed
(the divergences cancel in the dierence). from (4) and (5), we see that to
obtain odd(a, b; m), it is sucient to know (2)(a, b; m), which denotes the
term quadratic in a of (a, b; m). this term may be represented in fourier
space as

(2)(a, b; m) =

1

2 z

d4p
(2)4

a(p)(p) a(p) ,

(16)

where

and

a(p) = z d4x eipx a(x) ,

(p) = i z

d4l

(2)4 trh(6 l+ 6 p  m 6 b5)1(6 l  m 6 b5)1i .

(17)

(18)

in order to keep the full dependence in b, we must take the dirac trace in
(18), without expanding for small b. to do this we need to rationalize the
fermion propagator g(l),

g(l) =

i

6 l  m 6 b5

.

after some algebra, we nd that the rationalized form of g(l) is

g(l) =

i

l2  m2  b2 (cid:18)6 l + m 6 b5 +

2
m

lb(cid:19)

where

(19)

(20)

(21)

equation (20) already shows an interesting consequence of keeping the full
dependence in b, namely, that b actually shifts the value of the physical pole
in the fermion propagator. this is indeed, the ultimate reason for the emer-
gence of a logarithmic dependence in b2

m2 when calculating odd(a, b; m).

knowledge of the form (20) makes also easier to extract the odd part in
b. indeed, extracting the odd part and evaluating all the dirac traces we nd
that odd(a, b; m) may be written as

odd(a, b; m) =

1

2 z

d4p
(2)4

a(p)

odd(p, b; m) a(p) ,

(22)

with


odd(p, b; m) = 12 pb i(p, m2 + b2)

(23)

where i is the logarithmically divergent function

i(p, m 2) = z

the logarithmic divergence of odd(a, b; m), due to i(p), is now explicit. in
pauli-villars regularization, which we shall adopt, just one regulator eld
is sucient. one sees that evaluating the regulated version of odd(a, b; m)
amounts, in the end, just to replacing i in (23) by its regulated expression,
which in euclidean spacetime reads

i reg(p, m2 + b2) = 

i
162 ln(

.

(25)

to obtain reg
odd(a, b; m), we merely need to subtract from (25) its m = 0
counterpart. doing this, the result becomes -independent (there is no need
to take the    limit), yielding the nite result

i reg(p, m2 + b2)  i reg(p, b2) = 

b2 + m2

(26)

of course, to obtain the local induced term, we need to take the zero mo-
mentum limit in (26), what yields the result

lim

p0hi reg(p, m2 + b2)  i reg(p, b2)i = 

i
162 ln(

b2

m2 + b2 ) .

(27)

inserting this result into the analog of (22) for odd(a, b; m), collecting
also the contribution (15) from odd(a, b; 0), and writing the result for (6) in
conguration space, we obtain

odd(a, b; m) =

1
162 [3 ln(

b2

m2 + b2 )  2(1 + )]z d4x bfa .

(28)

the relation between k and b then becomes:

k = f (

b2
m2 ) b ,

6

(29)

where

f (x) =

1
82 [3 ln(

x

1 + x

)  2(1 + )] .

(30)

thus, whatever the value of the (undetermined) constant , the non-
analytic part will overcome that constant for b2
m2 suciently small. note,
however, that what diverges in the limit b  0 is not lk, which in fact tends
to zero (since b log b  0 when b  0), but rather the coecient which relates
the four-vectors k and b.

it is perhaps worth remarking that the result obtained for the mass de-
pendent correction is the same regardless of the regularization used, as long
as it is gauge invariant, since any nite counterterm cancels in the dierence.
we have checked that explicitly for the case of dimensional regularization.

one might think that the method followed in [4] could be extended to
cope with the full dependence on b. we have checked that part of the cal-
culation may be extended, in particular the evaluation of the surface term,
which yields actually the same result regardless of b. however, keeping the
dependence in b, makes it impossible to arrive to the nite integral in their
equation (13). namely, keeping the dependence in b to all orders one sees a
logarithmic divergence which is missed in [4]. this divergence is indeed the
very reason why the new, logarithmic term is generated.
