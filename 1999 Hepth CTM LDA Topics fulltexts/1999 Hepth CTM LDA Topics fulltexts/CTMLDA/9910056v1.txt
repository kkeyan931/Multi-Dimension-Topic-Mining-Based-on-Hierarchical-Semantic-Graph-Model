abstract

the one-loop four-graviton amplitude in either of the type ii superstring theories is
expanded in powers of the external momenta up to and including terms of order s4 log s r4,
where r4 denotes a specic contraction of four linearized weyl tensors and s is a man-
delstam invariant. terms in this series are obtained by integrating powers of the two-
dimensional scalar eld theory propagator over the toroidal world-sheet as well as the
moduli of the torus. the values of these coecients match expectations based on duality
relations between string theory and eleven-dimensional supergravity.

1. introduction

the wealth of duality symmetries relating dierent parameterizations of nonpertur-
bative string theory, or m theory, provide severe constraints on its structure. one striking
manifestation of this is the relationship between the low energy expansion of the type ii
string theory action and one-loop eects in compactied eleven-dimensional supergravity
[1]. although the systematics of this relationship becomes very murky at higher loops,
the leading behaviour of the two-loop contribution of the eleven-dimensional theory is
amenable to a detailed analysis (see the companion paper [2]).

this detailed comparison between string theory and eleven-dimensional supergravity
requires, among other things, detailed knowledge of the low energy expansion of the eec-
tive action of the type iia and type iib superstring perturbation theories. surprisingly,
this has scarcely been considered in the literature beyond the most elementary tree-level
terms. in this paper we will obtain terms in the eective action that arise from the mo-
mentum expansion of the one-loop type ii superstring theory contribution to the four
graviton amplitude. since the four-graviton tree and one-loop amplitudes in the iia and
iib theories are equal we need not distinguish between the two theories in the following1.

it is understood that the mass shell condition

s + t + u = 0

is enforced in all expressions which ensures that only conformally invariant ratios of ijs
arise in (1.9). for example, substituting u = s  t the exponent of (1.9) contains

1234
1324

,

1423
1324

.

(1.14)

this also ensures that the integrand is modular invariant. many of the following formulae
will be expressed in a symmetric form in terms of s, t and u even though these variables
are related by the condition (1.13). the relative normalization between the two terms in
(1.1) and (1.7) can be determined by unitarity as in [8,4].

the tree-level string amplitude (1.1) is suciently simple that it is easily expanded
to all orders in powers of the momentum. successive terms in this expansion lead to terms
in the eective action that are polynomials in derivatives acting on r4. the expansion of
t begins with the terms

t =

64

3stu

+ 2(3) +    .

(1.15)

substitution of the rst term in (1.1) reproduces the tree diagrams of classical ten-
dimensional n = 2 supergravity which have poles in the s, t and u channels. the second
term gives the leading correction to the supersymmetric einsteinhilbert theory and deter-
mines a term in the eective action proportional to r4. subsequent terms give information
on higher derivative interactions. the complete tree-level expansion will be reviewed in
section 2.

the one-loop string amplitude (1.7) also has a remarkably simple form  the overall
kinematic factor multiplies an integral over the moduli space of the toroidal world-sheet
that is constructed entirely from the scalar world-sheet propagator. the leading contribu-
tion is proportional to r4 but the nonleading terms in the momentum expansion have not
been calculated up to now. from general principles we can anticipate that the momentum
expansion of the one-loop amplitude has the structure,

i(s, t) =a +

consequence of perturbative unitarity due to the phase space available for massless two-
particle intermediate states. for energies such that s < 41 (i.e., below the rst massive
string threshold) the amplitude aoneloop

substituting the lowest-order (einsteinhilbert) tree-level term from (1.15) into both fac-
tors of atree
on the right-hand side of (1.18) leads immediately to the inonan 1 term in
(1.16). substitution of the term with coecient (3) from (1.15) into one of the factors
of atree
and the einsteinhilbert term into the other leads to the inonan 2 term in (1.16),
which has three extra powers of . these terms will be discussed in more detail in sections

the main purpose of this paper is to evaluate a number of terms in the expansion
(1.16). this exercise involves integrating modular invariant combinations products of the
scalar eld theory propagators ln ij over the toroidal world-sheet as well as integration
over the moduli space of the torus. although the integration of combinations of derivatives
of world-sheet scalar propagators has arisen in the literature, for example, in connection
with the elegant calculation of the elliptic genus [12], in order to perform the integrals
that arise in this paper we will need to use some tricks that that will be presented in
section 4. this will allow us to determine all the terms in (1.16) up to order 4inonan 2
(although the value of the coecient d will be left as a quadruple sum). the values of
these coecients are compared in [2] with the values that emerge by considering two-loop
eleven-dimensional supergravity compactied on a two-torus.

2. overview of the tree amplitude

the tree amplitude for the scattering of four gravitons of momenta k

3 and
k

written as [5],

where we have used the elementary identity ln (1  z) =  z +pn>1 (n)zn/n.

it is convenient to introduce the notation k = (/4)k (sk + tk + uk) (1 = 0), which

satises the recursion relation

the solution of these conditions can be expressed by the generating function,

since 3stu/64 = 3/3 and every 2n+1 is divisible by 3, the expansion of the

exponential in (1.1) can be expressed entirely in terms of polynomials of 2 and 3,

(2.5)

it will be signicant for the later discussion of unitarity that the series of powers of s, t and
u has gaps of three powers of the mandelstam invariants between the rst two terms and
two powers between the second and third terms. each term translates into a term in the
eective action of the type iib string theory which is the linearized version of a number
of covariant derivatives acting on r4. these higher derivative terms are part of the full
duality-invariant eective action for the type iib string.

3. expansion of the one-loop amplitude

in this section and the next we will consider the low energy expansion of the one-
loop integral (1.7) in powers of s, t and u. formally, this involves expanding the integrand
f (, ) (1.9) in powers of the scalar feynman propagator which are then integrated over
the toroidal world-sheet,

(3.1)

where the exponent is given by

d = s ln(1234) + t ln(1423) + u ln(1324).

(3.2)

this expansion is only formal since we already know that the amplitude is not analytic at
s = 0, t = 0 or u = 0. this lack of analyticity is manifested by divergent coecients in
the series (3.1). one way of dealing with this problem would be to consider the expansion
in a power series around a nonzero value of s, t and u  . the terms that are singular in
the   0 limit can then be resummed to give the logarithmic singularities.

a more straightforward procedure is to evaluate the coecients of the derivatives of

i in the small s, t and u limit. we will therefore consider the general term,

i (m,n)
an = lim
s,t0

(i (m,n)  i (m,n)

(3.3)

where s, t and u are dened in (1.11) and i (m,n)

nonan = (41)m+nm

s n

t inonan.

since inonan has logarithmic branch points the i (m,n)

nonan terms are singular functions
of s and t which must be extracted from the complete expression, (3.3), before the analytic
terms can be determined. since the nonanalytic terms originate, via unitarity, from the
logarithmic normal thresholds due to on-shell intermediate states we can anticipate that
they arise from the region of moduli space in which 2  , which is the degeneration
limit of the torus. our strategy in calculating i (m,n) will therefore be to introduce a cut-o
l at a nite but large value of 2. the region 2  l gives a nite contribution to i (m,n)
which includes i (m,n)
together with a l-dependent term. in this region the exponential
factor in the integrand on the right-hand side of (3.3) can be replaced by unity. however,
for 2  l the exponential factor plays a crucial role in regulating the integral, resulting
in the terms in i (m,n)
nonan together with another nite l-dependent piece. dependence on l
cancels out in the full expression. these nonanalytic terms will be considered in detail in
section 3.3, section 4.3 and the appendix.

an

dierentiating the analytic terms in (1.16) an appropriate number of times with
respect to s and t we see that the coecients that will be extracted from (3.3) have the
form (up to fourth order),

i (0,0)
an = a,
i (2,1)
an = 6c,

i (1,0)
an = 0,
i (3,0)
an = 0,

an = 4b = 2i (1,1)
i (2,0)
an ,
an = 24d = i (2,2)
i (3,1)
an ,

i (4,0)
an = 48d,

(3.4)

together with the terms obtained by interchanging s with t. the numerical values of the
coecients a, b and c will be determined in section 4, although d will be left in the form
of a multiple sum that will not be evaluated.

3.1. the scalar propagator on a torus

the exponent, d = (ss + tt + uu), in the expression (1.9) is a linear combi-
nation of scalar world-sheet propagators joining the locations of the four vertex operators.
the scalar propagator between two complex points, (i) = (i)
1 +i(j)
2 ,
on a torus of modulus  is the doubly periodic function of (ij) = (i)  (j) in the domain
t that has a logarithmic short distance singularity. thus, the propagator,

2 and (j) = (j)

1 +i(i)

p((ij)| ) = ln ij((ij),  ),

(3.5)

satisfying toroidal boundary conditions can be written as a sum over image propagators

(3.9)

the combination of propagators that enters the amplitude is one for which the zero
mode, c, cancels out. this is a crucial point in considering the modular invariance of the

7

integrand. the group sl(2, z) is generated by the two elements t :    + 1,    and
s :   1/,   / . under these transformations the propagator transforms as

t : p(| + 1) = p(| )

(3.10)

so the propagator has a modular anomaly which comes from the zero mode, c, in (3.8).
however, the sum over propagators in the exponent d is modular invariant since the zero
modes cancel after using the on-shell condition, s + t + u = 0. therefore, it is very
convenient to use the subtracted propagator,

p = ln ij ((ij),  ) = p  c,

(3.11)

which is modular invariant. the expression (3.8) can be written as a poincare series,3

(3.13)

where a, b, c and d are integers and ad  bc = 1.

we will also need to express the propagator as a fourier series in powers of e2i1,

3.2. the diagrammatic rules

the calculation of i (m,n) in (3.3) involves integration of powers of the propagators,
p((ij)| ), contracted between various combinations of the points i, j (i, j  {1, 2, 3, 4})
which are the locations of the vertex operators.

it is easy to deduce a set of diagramatic rules at any given order. a term of order n
(where each power of  may be any of the three rs with r = s, t, u) contains a product
of n propagators which join pairs of points (which we will call vertices) i, j(= 1, . . . , 4)
with positions (i) that are to be integrated over the torus. we will represent each vertex
of a diagram by a dot and each propagator linking two vertices by a line. the complete
nth order contribution requires a sum over all ways in which the propagators can join the
vertices. for any term in this sum every vertex that is not connected to any propagator

contributes a factor of rt d2i/2 = 1.

tion domain into two regions,

more generally, we need to isolate divergent contributions by dividing the  integra-

f = fl + rl.

(3.16)

the domain fl denes the restricted fundamental domain of the  plane in which 2  l,
whereas the domain rl denes a semi-innite rectangle in the  plane, in which 2  l. as
stated earlier, the terms i (m,n)
nonan that have threshold singularities at vanishing mandelstam
invariants arise from the domain rl and will be dealt with separately by integrating over
this large-2 region.

for the nite contributions that come from the domain fl the integrations over the
positions, (i) enforce overall conservation of the discrete momentum p = m + n in any
diagram. this means, for example, that any propagator with a free end-point gives a van-
ishing contribution since it has been normalized to have a vanishing zero mode. therefore,
non-zero contributions only come from diagrams in which two or more propagators end on
every vertex. various combinatorial factors are associated with each diagram and will be
described for each case separately.

3.3. the threshold term, inonan

the lack of analyticity of the low energy expansion of the one-loop amplitude (1.7)
due to the logarithmic thresholds makes the integral representation (1.7) ill-dened. since
there is no region of the mandelstam invariants in which the amplitude is real the only way
of making sense of the integral is to decompose the integration domain into three domains,
tst, ttu and tus, so that the amplitude is separated into real analytic terms that have
thresholds in the (s, t), (t, u) and (u, s) channels, respectively. the integral representation
for each of these terms can then be dened in the region of physical scattering, s > 0;
t, u < 0, by analytic continuation. for example, the (s, t) term is dened by continuation
from the region s, t < 0 (with u = s  t > 0) where it is real. this decomposition follows

9

very naturally in an operator construction of the loop amplitude but does not manifestly
preserve modular invariance [9].

the leading logarithmic singularity in i is the leading term in lims,t0r (ed  1).

this can be extracted by rst dierentiating the integral representation with respect to s,

(3.17)

the contribution from the domain fl vanishes due to the integration over the (ij). how-
ever, the region rl leads to a nonzero result. in this region we can approximate d by
using the asymptotic expression for the propagator (3.15) which is proportional to 2. in
the term with thresholds in the (s, t) channels the variables (i)
are ordered in such a
2
manner that the rescaled variables,

this ordering are relevant in the (t, u) and (u, s) regions so that the whole range, 0  i  1
is covered by adding the three regions, tst, ttu and tus, together. in terms of these variables
we have, in the region tst,

the scale of the logarithm cancels out of the sum of terms in the full expression. this

threshold term is exactly the same as that obtained from the one-loop calculation of the

four-graviton amplitude in either of the type ii supergravity theories in ten dimensions

[11,10]. the corresponding discussion of the higher-order threshold term, inonan 2, which
is intrinsically stringy since it involves higher powers of , will be given in the appendix.

such threshold terms are contained in the large-2 region of the integration over
moduli space, which means that they are contained in the coecients i (m,n)
that are
dened by integration over the domain rl. so long as 1 < m + n < 4 it will be sucient
to substitute the asymptotic form of the propagator which will produce contributions of

with p, q  0. the l-dependent term in this expression will cancel with a term that arises
from the integration over the domain fl. when m + n = 4 it is no longer adequate to use
the leading 2 contribution to the propagators and a sub-leading contribution of the form
ln l arises. this leads to the term inonan 2, as will be seen in more detail in section 4.3
and the appendix.

the analytic terms are extracted from the integration over fl which is nite. in
this domain we can rst perform the (i) integrals to obtain a density on the moduli space
and then integrate this over  and  .

the rst term in the expansion of (1.9) using (3.3) is the trivial constant term. the
result of the integrations is simply the nite volume of f . this denes the rst constant

which is the well-known coecient of the loop contribution to the r4 term.

the next terms in the expansion are i (1,0) and i (0,1) which are given by (3.17). as
remarked earlier, the (i) integrations in (3.17) cause the integrand to vanish in the domain
fl and the integral only contributes to i (1,0)

by substituting z2 = 2z2/2 using (4.3) so that the integrand is a total derivative and

single boundary which is at 2 = l and the result is

unlike the earlier examples, this expression is not an eigenfunction of the laplacian
on the fundamental domain so a new idea is needed in order to perform the integration over
fl. we will make use of the well-known unfolding procedure by using the representation
of the propagator by a poincare series (3.12). this relates the integral of   f over f
(where  is any poincare series) to an integral over the semi-innite line,

(4.13)

since the integration in (4.10) is over the restricted fundamental domain, fl, some care
has to be taken in using the unfolding procedure. for an integral such as (4.10), which
diverges like a power of l as l  , it turns out to be consistent to simply set f ( ) = 0
for 2  l, which cuts o the divergence at 2  .5 using this procedure we can express

the last term gives a l-independent contribution to the coecient d in (1.16). the other

mic threshold of order 4 s4 ln s which is contained in inonan 2 that is evaluated in the
appendix. taking into account the combinatorial factors, the contribution of these l-

the last remaining term to consider is c4. as with the two-loop term (4.10) this gives
an expression which is not an eigenfunction of the laplacian on the fundamental domain.
once again the d2 integration may be performed by using the unfolding procedure as

17

in the previous sub-section. however, in this case we have to take greater care of the
divergence of the integrand at 2 = l   (as pointed out in the footnote in section 4.2).
the integral can be rendered nite by subtracting a suitable linear combination of z4 and
z2

2 from the integrand. consider, for example,

in the integrand that are divergent in the limit l   from explicit form of p((12)| )
given in (3.14) and (3.15). this gives explicit l3 and ln l terms that can be subtracted in
a modular invariant manner by dening a regularized value of i (4,0)(c4),

5. summary and conclusion

in summary, we have determined the rst few coecients in the expansion (1.16) of
the four-graviton one-loop amplitude in either of the ten-dimensional type ii string theories.
after explicitly subtracting the non-analytic threshold terms inonan 1 and inonan 2, we
found that

(2)(3),

(5.1)

a =


6

,

b = 0,

c =

19

1
3

and d is given by the expression (4.37) that we have not evaluated.

these coecients give a little more insight into the structure of the low energy
expansion of four-graviton interactions in the m theory eective action. the leading term
of this type is the r4 term about which a great deal is known [14,15,16,17,18,1]. for
example, in the ten-dimensional limit corresponding to the type iib string theory, it has
dependence on the complex coupling,  = c(0) + ieb
(where c(0) is the r  r scalar
and b is the type iib dilaton), that enters by an overall factor of e3/2(, ), where es
is the modular invariant eisenstein series that is proportional to zs (see the footnote in
section 4.1). this function has an expansion for large 2 (weak coupling) that begins with
the tree-level term with coecient (3) in (2.5) and is followed by a one-loop term with a
coecient that is precisely the value of a in (5.1). there are no further perturbative terms
in the expansion but there is a precisely dened sequence of d-instanton contributions.

one method by which the exact form of the the r4 interaction was determined [1]
by calculating the one-loop contribution to four-graviton scattering in eleven-dimensional
supergravity compactied on a two-torus. recently this method has been generalized to
evaluate the two-loop contribution in eleven-dimensional supergravity which contributes
at leading order in the low energy expansion to the d4 r4 interaction, where the notation
symbolically indicates four derivatives acting on four powers of the curvature. in the limit
that gives the ten-dimensional type iib theory the interaction is given by a term in the
eective action density of the form [2]

, ) (s2 + t2 + u2) r4

(5.2)

(where the factors of s2, t2 and u2 represent appropriate derivatives acting on the cur-
vature tensors).
in this case the modular function e5/2 has an expansion for large 2
(weak coupling) that begins with the tree-level term with coecient (5) in (2.5) and is
followed by a two-loop term  the one-loop contribution is absent. again there are no fur-
ther perturbative string theory contributions but there is an innite series of d-instanton
contributions. the vanishing of the one-loop contribution in (5.2) is conrmed by our
statement that the coecient b in (5.1) vanishes.

the value of c in (5.1) is the coecient of the one-loop contribution to the (s3 + t3 +
u3) r4 interaction. this is not a term which has yet been motivated from any argument
based on duality or supersymmetry. in particular, it is not yet clear how this term packages
with the tree-level (3)2 term in (2.5) to make a modular invariant expression in the type
iib limit.

more generally, one might ask whether there is a simple modular invariant expression
for the complete four-graviton amplitude that generalizes the tree amplitude (2.1). an
obvious candidate is obtained by replacing the coecients 2(2n + 1) in the tree amplitude
(2.1) by  2n1
2(2n + 1)en+1/2 [19,20]. the resulting amplitude has s, t and u-channel

poles at values corresponding to the mass of every excited state of all the (p, q) d-strings.
this expression has been conjectured [19] to be some sort of approximation to the exact
four-graviton amplitude of the type iib theory. it does indeed reproduce the rst few of
the known coecients in the low energy expansion: by denition, it contains the exact
tree-level amplitude and it also contains the correct ratio of the e3/2 r4 term and the
e5/2 2 (s2 + t2 + u2) r4 term. however, it produces a value for the coecient of the
one-loop part of the 3 (s3 + t3 + u3) r4 interaction that is twice the value of c in (5.1).
it is not surprising that the naive modular invariant conjecture of [19] fails since there is
no obvious sense in which it can approximate the exact amplitude. after all it purports
to describe an innite number of highly unstable non-bps states in a non-perturbative
manner but lacks all of the (massless and massive) threshold cuts that are required by
unitarity.

appendix a. massless normal thresholds

the thresholds that arise from massless on-shell intermediate states come from the
region of integration over near the boundary of moduli space at which the toroidal world-
sheet pinches in such a manner that the four vertex operators are separated into two
bunches. at this degeneration point the world-sheet is the product of the two tree-level
world-sheets that enter in the right-hand side of (1.18).

in order to extract these thresholds from the expression (1.9) for the loop amplitude
it is very useful to change the denition of the moduli from (r) and  to (r) by dening

(1) = (1),

(2) = (1) + (2),

(3) = (1) + (2) + (3),

(4) =  = (1) + (2) + (3) + (4),

(a.1)

where we have used the conformal invariance of the loop amplitude to x (4) =  . the 
variables are the ones that arise naturally in the operator construction of the loop amplitude
as a trace over a string tree. in such a construction the propagator describing each leg of
the loop is written as

the sum over m in (a.5) and (a.7) gives the eect of the massive string states that
propagate between the vertices for the particles 1 and 2 or the vertices for the particles 3
and 4, i.e. in the legs of the loop that are not degenerating. these terms are the ones that
give rise to the stringy corrections to the low-energy eld theory thresholds.

the  expansion is obtained by expanding the last exponential in powers of s. the leading
term reproduces the eld theory s-channel threshold given by the rst term in (3.23). the
next contribution, linear in s, vanishes due to the integration over (2)

term has a factor of (s )2 and gives a non-zero contribution to the logarithmic behaviour
at order (s)4. after a little algebra (and adding the contributions of the ttu and tus
