abstract

we use dyonic brane congurations of type 0 string theory to study
large n non-supersymmetric 4d gauge theories. the brane congura-
tions dene theories similar to the supersymmetric ones which arise
in type ii. we nd the non-susy analogues of n = 2 and n = 1 . in
particular we suggest new non-susy cfts and a brane realization
of a non-susy seiberg duality.

1 introduction

in recent years we learned that d-branes can be used as a tool to study
supersymmetric gauge theories[1] (for a recent review and references see[2]).
using brane congurations of type iia/b string theory the seiberg-witten
curves of n = 2 [3] were given a geometrical realization [4], the running of the
coupling was related to the bending of the ns branes [4], and n = 1 seiberg
duality [5] was realized by the exchange of the ns supports [6, 7].
though much understanding was gained for supersymmetric theories,
branes congurations failed to teach us about non-supersymmetric gauge
theories, since non-susy brane congurations are usually not stable.

an important direction in the study of non-susy gauge theories is the
use of branes in the context of type 0 string theory[8]. type 0 string theory is
dened on the world sheet exactly like type ii, except that a non-chiral gso
projection is performed. the resulting sectors of the theory are the (ns-
,ns-),(ns+,ns+) and a doubled set of r-r elds. the low-energy elds of
the theory are therefore a tachyon, the bosonic (ns,ns) elds of type ii and
two-copies of r-r elds. accordingly two types of d-branes exists. we will
refer to the two kinds as electric and magnetic, and to a pair of electric
and magnetic as dyonic. the dyonic combination of branes was called also
untwisted by [9], as it belongs to the untwisted sector in their description
of type 0 as an orbifold of m theory.

klebanov and tseytlin argued that in the background of d-branes, the
r-r ux will cure the tachyon instability and that the gauge theory on the
branes is perfectly ok. using the electric d3 branes they constructed an
su(n) gauge theory with six adjoint scalars [8] and studied its behavior in
an ads/cft inspired way [10]. for recent related works see [11, 12].

another interesting construction uses a stack of n coincident dyonic d3
branes[11]. in this case each dyonic brane can be thought of as a pair made
of an electric and a magnetic brane. the strings that connect the electric-
electric and the magnetic-magnetic branes yields a su e(n)su m(n) gauge
theory with 6 magnetic adjoint scalars and 6 electric adjoint scalars. in addi-
tion the strings that connect electric-magnetic branes give rise to additional
4 bifundamental weyl fermions in the (n, n) and another 4 bifundamental
weyl fermions in the ( n, n) [13]. the model has similarities to the orbifold
models of kachru and silverstein[14]. although it cannot be obtained by
a string orbifold of type iib, it can be viewed as a eld theory orbifold

1

truncation (in the sense of ref.[15]) of n = 4 u(2n) super yang-mills[16].
an interesting remark is that although the theory is non-susy it admits a
moduli space of vacua[17, 18].

the gravity solution of this conguration is an ads5 s5 space with con-
stant dilaton and zero tachyon. therefore klebanov and tseytlin interpreted
this theory as a non-susy cft[11]. the fact that the stringy solution of
type 0 dyonic d3 branes is the same as that of type ii is not surprising.
when we consider dyonic branes in type 0 (i.e. identifying electric and mag-
netic branes), a solution with zero tachyon and the same massless bosonic
elds as in type ii would exist. the only additional conditions are large n
and small enough t hooft coupling[11]. the reason for the similarity is that
in these cases, the s-matrix of type 0 sphere amplitudes is the same as the
bosonic s-matrix of type ii[8]. therefore the low-energy eective action of
type 0 is almost the same. the dierences are the existence of two r-r elds
and the presence of the tachyon which is coupled to other elds with even
powers. as a result, we nd a solution of the equations of motion in which
the tachyon is zero and the two kinds of r-r elds are identied. this is
exactly the type ii solution. an important remark is the necessity of large
n. higher order contributions to the tree level action (string loops) may
contribute terms which do not have even powers of tachyon, hence the zero
tachyon solution cease to exist. however, these contributions are suppressed
in the large n limit. another remark is that the r-r ux is expected to
shift the tachyon mass to positive values only when the t hooft coupling is
small enough. therefore only in this limit, the solution with zero tachyon is
expected to be stable.

from the eld theory point of view, the class of theories that we consider
here fall into the class of orbifold eld theories. it was shown in ref.[15], and
later generalized to the case of product groups in [19], that certain truncation
of supersymmetric eld theories would yield a non-supersymmetric gauge
theory with exactly the same large n green functions. as we will show, the
type 0 truncation corresponds to such an orbifold projection.

the perturbative equivalence to all orders of the non-susy theory and
its susy parent is in apparent conict with the result of [11] that the non-
susy theory is well dened only for  < 100. there seems to be two options:
(i). there are non-perturbative eects, which are not suppressed in the large
n, and are captured by string theory and therefore the two theories are only
perturbatively equivalent. (ii). the equivalence persists beyond perturbation

2

theory though we cannot trust the gravity description any longer.

in this paper, we would like to generalize the d3 solution to the more com-
plicated cases when we include ns branes. since the above reasoning should
hold in this case also, we expect that the non-supersymmetric theory which
lives on the analogous brane conguration would share many of the proper-
ties of supersymmetric one. in particular, in the large n limit, these theories
would have the same perturbative green functions and hence the same per-
turbative beta function. an important remark is that the validity of this
approach is subjected to the assumption of equivalence of the non-susy and
the parent theory beyond perturbation theory. the simplest example is the
n = 2 brane conguration of type ii. here we also expect to have the same
moduli space and a mass spectrum which is bose-fermi degenerate, though
non-susy. for the special case of nf = 2nc we will have a large n non-
susy cft. another class of large n non-susy cfts can be constructed
from the type 0 analogue of the brane-boxes congurations[20, 21]. the type
0 analogue of the n = 1 conguration yields a non-supersymmetric version
of seiberg duality. in particular, the type 0 theories are expected to maintain
the phase structure in the nf /nc axis. these theories are a special case of
the theories considered in the past by schmaltz who showed that the large
n orbifold eld theories of n = 1 admits duality[19]. it is interesting that
in the present case the duality can be understood also via branes.
some open questions are raised by this discussion. we discuss large n
non-susy eld theories which have the same dynamics as supersymmet-
ric ones. in particular these theories have the same number of bosons and
fermions. one wonders if there is any symmetry (not susy) which is re-
sponsible for that. in the supersymmetric parent the particle spectrum is
divided to bps and non-bps. we expect the distinction to carry over to the
non-susy theory, such that the masses of the bps particles is given by a
bps-like formula. is there an intrinsic way to distinguish the two kinds?

the organization of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we describe the
type 0 string theories and their relation to the ii string theories. in section
3 we explain the orbifold truncation of eld theory and its relation to type
0 theories. section 4 is devoted to the study of the non-susy analogues of
n = 2 . in section 5 we consider the non-susy version of seiberg duality.
we describe nite non-susy models using brane boxes in section 6. section
7 is devoted to conclusions.

2 type 0 string theory

type ii a/b string theories have non-supersymmetric analogues called type
0 a/b. the type 0 theories are constructed via a non-chiral gso projection
which keeps the following bosonic sectors

type 0a: (ns, ns)  (ns+, ns+)  (r+, r)  (r, r+)
type 0b: (ns, ns)  (ns+, ns+)  (r+, r+)  (r, r)
the tree level type 0b action from the (ns+, ns+) sector is exactly the

same as the type iib action[8]

where fn+1 is the eld strength of the dyonic r-r elds and h(n+1)(t ) de-
scribes the coupling of the tachyon to the r-r elds. note that although the
functions h(n+1)(t ) are not known, symmetry arguments for the coupling
to the electric and magnetic forms require that these functions should be
even in the dyonic case.

it is therefore clear that a solution in a dyonic background with t = 0
is the same as the solution of the bosonic elds of type ii supergravity.
while this statement is trivial in the tree level, it is certainly wrong for
gs > 0[11], since torus amplitudes generate odd tachyon contributions to the
action. therefore similarities between supersymmetric type ii gauge theories
and non-supersymmetric type 0 theories are expected to occur in the large
n limit, like the d3 type 0 case [11], the orbifold models of kachru and
silverstein [14] and the non-supersymmetric version of seiberg n = 1 duality
which was considered by schmaltz [19].

4

note also that in order to have a stable t = 0 solution, we must shift the
tachyon mass. since the function h(t ) contains a t 2 part, for large enough
r-r ux the tachyon mass-squared becomes positive. in the background of
a dp brane, this condition translates into a requirement of small t hooft
coupling.

3 type 0 projected eld theories

given a brane conguration in type ii string theory, one can construct a new
non-supersymmetric eld theory by considering the same brane conguration
in type 0 with dyonic branes replacing the type ii d-branes. this procedure
can be given an intrinsic denition in eld theory, which we shall discuss now.
the new eld theory will be constructed by a certain (orbifold) projection of
a susy eld theory. all amplitudes of the non-susy theory will be identical,
in the large n limit, to amplitudes of the parent theory.

for n = 4  (the type 0 version of n = 4 ) this was shown by [16] who
put the type 0 projection in a form suitable for the more general methods
of [14, 22, 15]. one starts with a u(2nc) n = 4 theory and performs a
z2 projection, keeping only the invariant elds. the z2 is embedded into
the z4 center of the so(6) r-symmetry and its generator acts on the gauge

0

group as  = " 1
0 1 # , where the entries are nc  nc blocks. the result-
ing spectrum is made of bosons in the adjoint of su e(nc)  su m(nc) and
fermions in the bifundamental. the projection will preserve all amplitudes
in the large n limit, since if satises the condition that the matrix  be
traceless.

the generalization to theories with less susy and with the addition of
avor was discussed by [19]. as susy qcd-like theories include matter with
indices in a su(2nf )l  su(2nf )r global symmetry, they are not explicitly
included in the previous discussion that assumes matter in the adjoint. one
needs to embed the z2 into the avor group as well. the avor indices are
divided into electric and magnetic in the same manner as the color indices.
all elds in qcd-like theories carry two indices which are either color-color
or color-avor. the projected matter content turns out to be made, again,
of bosons when both indices are of the same kind (say electric-electric), and
fermions for magnetic-electric, where now each index can be either color or

5

avor. in [19] it was checked and proven that the large n amplitudes are
preserved.

4 the n = 2  brane conguration
consider the type 0 analogue of an n = 2 theory with gauge group su(nc)
and nf matter hypermultiplets. we refer to it as a n = 2  theory. to
determine the matter content one can either use the type 0 projection
of a su(2nc) theory with 2nf hypers, or read it o the appropriate brane
conguration, as we shall. in type ii, the relevant brane conguration is a
stack of nc color d4 branes extending between two ns5 supports, and nf
semi-innite avor d4s ending on the supports. strings stretched between
the color branes give the vectors in the adjoint, while the strings between the
color and avor branes give hypers in the fundamental. in passing to type
0, we replace both color and avor d4s by dyonic d4s - a mix of an equal
number of electric and magnetic branes.

one can now read the matter content after recalling that electric-electric
(ee) or magnetic-magnetic (mm) strings are bosons, while electric-magnetic

table 1: the matter content of the n = 2  theory

it is immediately seen that the n = 2  theory has the same 1-loop beta

function as its parent n = 2 theory:

 = 2nc  nf .

(4)
in comparison with the original n = 2 theory we have the same number
of elds in the fundamental, while we traded the gauginos in the adjoint
with fermions in the bifundamental (and its complex conjugate). but these
two representations have the same group theoretic factor nc = t (adj) =
2nct (fund), t (r)ab = trr[t at b]. however, other group theoretical factors
of the two representations do dier, and so will higher loop computations
(for nite nc).

one can hope for simplications in the large nc limit.

in addition to
keeping the t hooft coupling  = g2
y m nc, xed, we x the avor ratio
f = nf /nc and the scale of mass of the ws (we are assuming that the large
nc theory has a moduli space).

7

for n = 4  theories is was proven [16, 22, 23, 15] that in the large
n limit, it has the same amplitudes as the parent n = 4 - one views both
u(nc) n = 4  and u(nc), n = 4 as projections of u(2nc), n = 4 ,
and hence correlation functions of elds which are shared by both theories
(namely, the bosons in the adjoint) must be the same. as discussed in the
previous section, we nd that this is the case for the n = 2  theories as
well. supporting evidence comes from the gravitational background of the
type 0 brane conguration - as the type 0 background is identical to the
one in type ii, and given the eld theory - gravity correspondence[10], one
expects the theories to have the same amplitudes. this implies some exact
results for these non-susy large nc theories: the nf = 2nc theory would be
exactly conformal. for any f the theories would have exact at directions,
leading to an (innite dimensional) moduli space. for n = 4  a moduli
space is expected to exist as a consequence of the no force between dyonic 3
branes in type 0 [8, 18]. and finally, the mass of bps particles would be
expected to be free of corrections. in particular, the masses of the ws are
expected to be the same as of the supersymmetric theory, since the relevant
green functions are the same.

5 n = 1  and seiberg duality
let us consider now the type 0 analogue of n = 1 sqcd. the supersym-
metric (electric) theory consists of a su(nc) vector multiplet and two chiral
su(nf ) multiplets. the brane realization of the theory is similar to the
n = 2 conguration and it is obtained by rotating one of the ns5 branes
such that half of the supersymmetries are broken. passing to the type 0
theory , the matter content is summarized in the following table

table 3: the content of the magnetic n = 1  theory. nc = nf  nc.
seiberg showed that the electric and the magnetic theories describes the
same ir physics. the duality was realized geometrically via an exchange
of the ns branes[6, 7]. we claim that the large n (keeping f = nf /nc
xed) type 0 electric and magnetic theories are also dual. the eld theory
reasonings, for a wider class of theories, was given in [19].

the branes gives a simple evidence that n = 1 duality holds. one may
simply repeat the same steps of [6]. the dyonic branes dynamics of type 0
is identical to that of type ii and therefore starting with the electric theory
one would end with the magnetic theory.

the eld theory arguments in favor of the duality are based on[19]. since
the green functions, in the large n, are identical, it follows that the type 0
eld theory has the same phase structure and dynamics as the type ii eld
theory and therefore duality between the supersymmetric theories implies
duality between the non-susy ones.

in particular it it easy to check that the one loop beta function of the

10

electric theory type 0 theory is

 = 3nc  nf ,

(5)

exactly as of the n = 1 theory. moreover, the eld theory analysis of [15, 19]
suggests that a conformal window exists for 3
2nc < nf < 3nc. another
simple check is the anomaly. both the type 0 electric theory and magnetic
theory have the same global anomalies. the reason is [19] that the anomalies
are calculated by planar diagrams which are the same in the non-susy theory
and its parent. for instance,

su 3(nf )  nc
su 2(nf )ub(1)  nc

(6)

thus, though the theory is not supersymmetric we have a good under-

standing of the ir physics and the phase structure.

6 brane boxes and cfts

brane boxes suggest a nice realization of nite four dimensional supersym-
metric gauge theories via type iib string theory[20, 21]. let us review, briey,
the construction of these congurations. the reader is referred to [21] for a
comprehensive discussion. consider a set of n d5 branes along 012346 direc-
tions, a set of parallel ns branes along 012345 directions and additional set
of parallel ns branes along 012367 directions. the models that we consider
here are on a torus in the 46 directions. the resulting theory is, generically,
n = 1 gauge theory in four dimensions. the theories are described in the
following gure

figure 2: finite brane-boxes theories. there are k  k boxes. the drawn 46
plane is a torus.

let us denote the number of horizontal boxes by k and the number of
vertical boxes by k. each box describe an su(n) gauge group which in-
teracts with the other boxes via open strings. the allowed directions of
strings (which are drawn as arrows) are north, south, east, west and two of
the diagonals: northwest and southeast. note that the northeast and the
southwest diagonal arrows are not allowed[20]. each triangle of arrows form
a contribution to the superpotential w . the sign of the contribution to the
superpotential is dictated by the handedness of the triangle. thus a generic
nite model is an su(n)  ...  su(n) (kk times) gauge theory with bi-
fundamental matter. the ns/ns branes do not bend since there are same
number of d branes in each side of them. in addition there is a superpoten-
tial. the form of the superpotential together with the fact that the ns/ns
branes do not bend guarantee that these models are indeed nite.

the case of k = k = 1 is special.

in this case the supersymmetry is

12

enhanced to n = 4 . when k = 1, k > 1 the supersymmetry is enhanced to
n = 2 . the generic case k, k > 1 corresponds to n = 1 supersymmetry.
these models can be constructed in type 0 also. in the large n we will
have non-supersymmetric cfts which are analogues to the above n = 4 ,
n = 2 and n = 1 models. the rule of constructing the type 0 gauge
theory is described in section 3. put n electric and n magnetic d-branes
in each box. accordingly the gauge group will be su e(n)  su m(n) 
...  su e(n)  su m(n) (kk electric and kk magnetic groups). strings
that connect electric-electric or magnetic-magnetic branes are bosons whereas
strings that connect electric-magnetic branes are fermions.

let us consider the special example of k = k = 2. the supersymmetric
model consist of a gauge group su(n)  su(n)  su(n)  su(n) with
vector like matter in the bifundamental of each of the two groups.
the analogous type 0 theory contains eight gauge groups. the vectors
(gluons) are in the adjoints of the gauge groups, the gauginos are in
the bifundamental of su e(n)  su m(n) pairs which originate from a same
eight weyl fermions. the matter consist of six com-
gauge group, i.e.
plex scalars (squarks) in su e(n)  su e(n) and six complex scalars in
su m(n)  su m(n). in addition there are twelve weyl fermions (quarks)
which belong to su e(n)su m(n). the matter elds originate from distinct
su(n) groups.
again, it is easy to see that the one loop beta function is zero. the proofs

of [15, 19] guarantee that the theory is indeed nite.

these non-susy cfts are new in the sense that they cannot be con-

structed by an orbifold of type iib[14, 23].

7 conclusions

in this paper we constructed various non-supersymmetric large n gauge the-
ories which were suggested to share many properties of their supersymmetric
parents. in particular, we found cfts, a special version of seiberg duality
(which was considered rst in[19]), a degenerate mass spectrum and a moduli
space of vacua.

the construction of non-supersymmetric brane congurations suggests
many directions of research. we didnt consider theories in higher or lower
dimensions than four and we didnt consider branes in the presence of ori-

13

entifolds. it seems that many results which were obtained via type ii brane
congurations can be easily copied to the type 0 case.
