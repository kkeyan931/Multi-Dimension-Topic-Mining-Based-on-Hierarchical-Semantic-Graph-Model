supergravity and supersymmetry breaking in

four and five dimensions

abstract

we discuss supersymmetry breaking in the eld-theoretical limit of the strongly-coupled het-
erotic string compactied on a calabi-yau manifold, from the dierent perspectives of four
and ve dimensions. the former applies to light degrees of freedom below the threshold for
ve-dimensional kaluza-klein excitations, whereas the ve-dimensional perspective is also valid
up to the calabi-yau scale. we show how, in the latter case, two gauge sectors separated in
the fth dimension are combined to form a consistent four-dimensional supergravity. in the
lowest order of the 2/3 expansion, we show how a four-dimensional supergravity with gauge
kinetic function f1,2 = s is reproduced, and we show how higher-order terms give rise to four-
dimensional operators that dier in the two gauge sectors. in the four-dimensional approach,
supersymmetry is seen to be broken when condensates form on one or both walls, and the
goldstino may have a non-zero dilatino component. as in the ve-dimensional approach, the
lagrangian is not a perfect square, and we have not identied a vacuum with broken supersym-
metry and zero vacuum energy. we derive soft supersymmetry-breaking terms for non-standard
perturbative embeddings, that are relevant in more general situations such as type i/type iib
orientifold models.

introduction

in their impressive analysis of the eective eld theory limit of the strongly-coupled heterotic
e8 e8 string theory, horava and witten [1, 2] constructed a consistent eleven-dimensional su-
pergravity on a manifold m4xs1/z2, coupled to ten-dimensional yang-mills models on the
xed hyperplanes of the s1/z2 orbifold. witten [1] also solved the equations of motion along
the eleventh dimension on the orbifold s1/z2, and found the correct six-dimensional compact-
ication that preserves four unbroken supercharges in the presence of non-trivial background
components of the antisymmetric tensor eld gabcd. he also calculated the gravitational
constant in four dimensions and the gauge couplings on both the visible and hidden walls.

on the basis of general arguments, this should reduce to some four-dimensional n = 1 su-
pergravity theory in the infrared limit, but the above results were obtained without constructing
explicitly the eective lagrangian in four dimensions. knowing that the nal eective theory
is four-dimensional n = 1 supergravity, one way to obtain the complete lagrangian is simply
to read the kahler potential, superpotential and gauge kinetic functions o from the direct
d = 11  4 reduction of the relevant eleven-dimensional terms. with the full four-dimensional
lagrangian at hand, one can study the properties of its vacuum, such as supersymmetry break-
ing, and thereby understand the infrared limit of the strongly-coupled heterotic superstring.

we follow this route in the rst part of this paper, and contrast the generic features of
supersymmetry breaking due to gaugino condensation [3] in the strongly-coupled case [4] with
the better-known weakly-coupled case [5]. an important dierence is that supersymmetry is
generically broken by non-zero expectation values of both f s and f t in the strongly-coupled
string. the eective potential of the four-dimensional supergravity in the strongly-coupled case
cannot be written simply as a perfect square, complicating the minimization problem, which
is not solved simply by minimizing the |f s|2 term alone. this observation may be welcome,
given the phenomenological interest [6] in the dilaton-dominated scenario for supersymmetry
breaking. however, we also demonstrate that the potential does not vanish generically.

the four-dimensional approach is appropriate if the condensation scale  is smaller than
the threshold m5 = 1/r5 for ve-dimensional kaluza-klein excitations. however, studying the
compactication chain d = 11  5  4 [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] is justied whatever the scale 
of the nonperturbative physics. this approach allows us to study how the low-energy four-
dimensional model arises out of the two d = 10  4 sectors which are spatially disconnected in
the original d = 11  5 theory, in other words, how the two gauge sectors are glued together
in course of the compactication process.
it was noted in the earliest days of m phenomenology that the size of the eleventh (fth)
dimension must be larger than the calabi-yau radius, if one enforces unication of the gauge
and gravitational couplings [1]. therefore, it is physically more interesting to compactify rst
the six calabi-yau dimensions: d = 11  5, and only later the fth dimension of the resulting
ve-dimensional supergravity: d = 5  4. it has also been stressed [12] that the d = 11  5
compactication is, in the presence of a non-trivial background for g, mathematically more
consistent than the path d = 11  10  4. it can be thought of as a calabi-yau compact-
ication with non-vanishing values of the four-form eld gabcd in the internal calabi-yau
directions [12, 13, 14, 15], i.e., on a manifold with torsion. such a construction gives gauged
ve-dimensional supergravity, as was rst emphasized in [9], see also [11], whose equations of

1

motions have domain-wall solutions. these may be viewed as creating spontaneously the s1/z2
orbifold and reproduce the witten solution in the approximation linear in x11. the domain wall
which is the vacuum solution of the gauged supergravity is a bps state, i.e., it breaks four out
of the eight supercharges possessed by the simple ungauged supergravity/abelian yang-mills
theory in ve dimensions.

the complete compactication of that ve-dimensional model down to four dimensions
has not yet been performed. an important aspect of the attempt to establish the detailed
relation between the horava-witten model [2] and the four-dimensional supergravity is that
the horava-witten lagrangian, although anomaly-free and supersymmetric, is only a limited
approximation to the strongly-coupled string. it contains terms which are of the order 2/3
with respect to the gravitational action, plus those terms of order 4/3 which are necessary to
maintain supersymmetry in eleven dimensions.

however, when one integrates out the fth dimension to obtain various terms in the four-
dimensional lagrangian, such as two- and four-fermion terms, one nds that those portions
of these terms that dier from one wall to the other arise at order 4/3 and higher. thus, in
order to reproduce them reliably, one would need to go beyond the linearized solution given
by witten [1], even beyond the original eleven-dimensional eld-theoretical lagrangian. the
problem is underlined by the observation that supersymmetry in various dimensions interrelates
terms that are of dierent orders in the expansion parameter 2/3. as we shall argue below, one
important implication of this situation is that certain features of the horava-witten approxi-
mation to the strongly-coupled heterotic dynamics, such as the global supersymmetry-breaking
mechanism of horava [16], may be artefacts of the approximation, that are not present in the
four-dimensional eective supergravity. it is nevertheless instructive to compactify explicitly
the fth dimension and see the structure of the four-dimensional supergravity in the consistent
lowest-order approximation in 2/3.

one issue to be discussed within this framework is the transmission of supersymmetry break-
ing by the ve-dimensional bulk supergravity [10, 11, 8] 1. the ve-dimensional supergravity
formulation is particularly suitable for studying the dynamical supersymmetry breaking of the
residual four supercharges and its transmission between spatially-separated gauge sectors, for
the following reasons. since we know completely the structure of the simplest ve-dimensional
supergravity, we can study the breaking of supercharges within a fully-consistent supersym-
metric model. secondly, we can identify already in ve dimensions all the massless degrees of
freedom of the eective four-dimensional supergravity model. the bulk elds have well-dened
properties under the z2 orbifold parity, and therefore one can write down z2-invariant couplings
with the walls. as we see in more detail later, the supersymmetry breaking on the visible wall
occurs locally, without any need to average over the fth dimension, once some elds or their
derivatives acquire vevs that are non-vanishing locally on the wall, as a result of equations of
motion in the fth dimension.

in the present letter, we complete the previous work rst by adding explicitly to the bulk
lagrangian studied in [10] the most relevant lagrangian terms on the four-dimensional walls,
as obtained by dimensional reduction of the original horava-witten wall lagrangian from

1discussions of alternative approaches to supersymmetry breaking, e.g., the scherk-schwarz mechanism,
averaging over the fth dimension, anomaly mediation and invoking a tower of kaluza-klein states can be
found in [17, 19, 20, 21]. these have features that dier from the mechanism discussed here.

d = 10  4 on a calabi-yau manifold. next, we reduce the fth dimension by solving the
equations of motion and integrating out the components of the ve-dimensional elds which
depend on the fth coordinate. the equations of motion are determined by the structure
of the ve-dimensional theory, and it turns out that we can solve them explicitly only in
the linearized approximation. in this way, we identify the ve-dimensional origins of various
parts of the four-dimensional eective action, in particular those that play a role in gaugino
condensation. as already mentioned, this explicit construction is complete only to lowest order
in 2/3 and, therefore, the four-dimensional supergravity obtained in this approximation is
dierent from that considered in section 2, which includes fully the thershold corrections to
the gauge kinetic functions that arise in the strongly-coupled heterotic e8  e8 string. finally,
we address the subtle question how the nonlinearities appearing in the solutions of the ve-
dimensional equations of motion for the bulk moduli elds t into the canonical structure of
the four-dimensional supergravity.

supersymmetry breaking in four dimensions

we begin by following the rst route described in the introduction. we recall that one obtains
from the horava-witten model [2] the kahler functions and the gauge kinetic functions for the
standard and non-standard embeddings, consistently to order 2/3, that is with the threshold
corrections to the gauge kinetic functions included. this is sucient to reconstruct directly the
parts of the scalar potential that are relevant for seeing the supersymmetry-breaking structure
in the eective four-dimensional supergravity theory arising from the strongly-coupled heterotic
string below the scale m5 = 1
. in this case, it is fully adequate to work entirely within the
r5
four-dimensional supergravity framework, as we assume in this section.

we rst recall the way the vev of gaugino bilinears habi enters the eective scalar po-
tential of the four-dimensional supergravity [22] 2. using the canonical normalization in four
dimensions for the gravitational, gauge and gaugino kinetic terms, the relevant part of the
lagrangian is

v = ekgij(diw +

fabhabi) + ...,

(1)

where gij is the inverse kahler metric and rest of the notation is standard [22].

comparing (1) with the well-known general expression v = gijf if j  3eg for the four-
dimensional potential in terms of the f i, the auxiliary elds for the chiral multiplets, we read
o the modied expressions for the auxiliary elds in the presence of the condensates

f i = ek/2gij(dj

fabhabi).

(2)

in the following, we match this expression explicitly to the fermionic bilinears in the eective
lagrangian, since [4] this is a better description when the gauge kinetic function depends on

2we denote by a the gaugino components, where a is an adjoint group index, and i labels complex moduli

elds.

3

more than one modulus, and the gaugino bilinears are among the terms obtainable directly
from the calabi-yau reduction.

we recall briey the situation in the weakly-coupled heterotic string. there, at tree level,
the gauge kinetic function is universal: f = s, and the kahler function for the illustrative case
of a single universal modulus t is k =  log(s + s)  3 log(t + t ).
in this case, the full
potential

reduces to

v = gs s|f s|2 + gt t|f t|2  3|w|2ek

(3)

(4)
since gt t|f t|2 = 3|w|2ek. this relation is equivalent to the vanishing of the perfect square
containing the gaugino condensates in the ten-dimensional eective action of the weakly-coupled
heterotic superstring [23]. in this way, we nd

v = gs s|f s|2,

f s = 0, f t 6= 0

(5)

at the level of quantum corrections, there are additional contributions to the gauge kinetic
functions which depend on the modulus t , and additional terms required by the space-time
modular invariance appear in terms containing gaugino bilinears, and hence in the eective
superpotential describing condensation. however, in all the models studied so far, the vacuum
relation f s  f t persists, and supersymmetry breaking occurs along the t direction in the
moduli space. the technical reason is that the dependence on s factorizes out in simple
modular-invariant models of condensation, and the equations of motion, i.e., dynamics, tell us
that f s is small. the vev of the modulus t is rather small in these models, close to unity in
supergravity units.

the structure of the supersymmetry-breaking sector is signicantly modied in the strongly-
coupled regime. the kahler function for the universal moduli s, t is the same, but the classical,
or tree level, gauge kinetic functions are changed, and are dierent for dierent walls: f1,2 =
s  0t where

here k is the kahler (1, 1)-form, and the topological integral over calabi-yau space can
be parametrized in terms of gauge and gravitational instanton numbers characterizing the
embedding [24]:

(7)

the interesting region of moduli space is where s = o(2) and t = o(80) [24, 25]. hence, we
are not interested in mechanisms which generate minima of the potential at t  1, but need
some new mechanism which generates a minimum in the region of current interest. we do not
discuss any specic mechanism here, but just state the possibilities opened up by the current
form of the kinetic functions.

first, we note that s and t enter the kinetic functions, and hence any nonperturbative
potential, in quite a symmetric way. the relative coecient 0 (7) which weights the contribu-
tion of t changes from model to model. in the elliptic-bration models of [25], this number is

4

smaller than 0.025. it could in principle be either much larger or much smaller in more general
constructions. because of thegreater symmetry between s and t , there is no obvious reason
why f s should be much smaller than f t in the generic case. in the strongly-coupled case, we
obtain

it is clear that supersymmetry is unbroken: f s = f t = 0 if and only if both condensates vanish.
even if there is only one condensate, both f s and f t are non-zero. moreover, if condensates
on both walls are switched on simultaneously, no matter in what proportion, supersymmetry is
always broken in four dimensions. in particular, even when the two condensates are switched
on with the same magnitude, and opposite signs, supersymmetry is formally broken 4, contrary
to [16]. a further consequence of f s 6= 0 is a non-zero scalar mass, which arises from (1)
upon substituting the correction ks = 0|aq|2/(s + s)2 5, which gives soft scalar masses
proportional to 0f s.

finally, we examine the ratio of the two f terms

(11)

in the present region of moduli space, the ratio of s/t is of the order 1/40 or so, so it would
not require very much ne-tuning to arrange the magnitudes of the condensates in such a way
that the ratio f s/f t is of the order of unity or larger. to make the possibility of the mixed
s, t -moduli-driven scenario more plausible, we look at the ratio f s/f t more carefully. as
pointed out in [24], one can easily express the expectation value of t through the observable
quantities t = ( mp
4gu t  0t . as a result, we
mgu t
obtain the ratio of the f terms as a function of 0:

3here we suppress the possibility of a constant superpotential contribution, which could arise as a vev of
the gauge and/or gravitational chern-simons forms on either wall, whose inclusion does not change the general
picture.

that multiplies the kinetic terms of the four-dimensional charged scalars [26].

5this correction arises from the correction to the metric of the calabi-yau space, i.e., to the factor of g(6)

5

the prefactor multiplying the condensates can be studied as a function of 0, when we x the
observables at their mssm values. one nds that the prefactor vanishes at 0  0.025, but
grows quickly to values of o(1) for larger 0, and to the values  0.07 at 0  0.01. for negative
0, i.e., in the regime of strong unication, the value of the prefactor is always larger than 1/10.
thus, it is possible to obtain quite a large value of f s, and even the extreme option of s-dilaton-
driven supersymmetry breaking cannot be excluded in the strongly-coupled heterotic string.
this could have interesting consequences, given the promising results of phenomenological
investigations of this limit in the weakly-coupled string.

we nish this section with a list of the soft termswe found in the four-dimensional super-
gravity approach, which is the way the soft terms were obtained in all the papers published
so far: [18, 19, 27, 28, 29]. we generalize the earlier results by considering non-standard em-
beddings in which charged matter is present on both walls, i.e., in both gauge sectors, and we
allow for condensates to form on both walls 6. restoring powers of the reduced planck mass

note that there is a dierence of sign between the expressions linear in 0 corresponding to
dierent walls. this can have consequences in some of non-standard embedding models, where,
e.g., matter with standard model hypercharge may exist on both walls. the dilaton-dominated
limit corresponds to sin   1. we can see from the formulae for the a terms and gaugino
masses that even in this limit there is non-universality between terms containing charged elds
from dierent walls. as for soft scalar masses in this context, one can easily imagine strongly-
coupled heterotic string models analogous to weakly-coupled orbifolds with twisted matter,
where the scalar masses for many twisted elds are non-zero. using standard supergravity for-
mulae, one can easily write down the expressions for these masses, in terms of the corresponding
kahler potential k,

one again notices the characteristic dierences of sign between terms from dierent wall, and
the universality of these terms is violated even in the dilaton-driven supersymmetry-breaking
limit.

the five-dimensional connection between four-dimensional
worlds

in this section, we construct explicitly the four-dimensional supergravity lagrangian that arises
from the sequence of compactications: d = 11  5  4, remembering that the result can be
trusted only in the lowest order in 2/3. in this case, the four-dimensional lagrangian is born
from two spatially-separated gauge sectors. as will be clear from our construction, the result
obtained at the lowest order of the expansion in 2/3 should be a four-dimensional supergravity
theory in the approximation f1,2 = s.

the general ve-dimensional model obtainable through compactication of eleven-dimensional

supergravity on the deformed calabi-yau space constructed in [1] has already been given in [11].
there were worked out the couplings of some important operators belonging to the yang-mills
sectors living on the walls, such as gaugino bilinears and scalar trilinear operators derived from
the lorentz chern-simons terms, to scalar elds living in the ve-dimensional bulk. here we
concentrate on details of these couplings which are relevant for the construction of the eective
four-dimensional model, and identifying the operators that violate four-dimensional supersym-
metry.

we must rst return to the bianchi identity for g11abc, and to the perfect-square structure
of horava [16]. horava has shown that, for the lagrangian describing the eleven-dimensional
supergravity coupled to two yang-mills sectors on the ten-dimensional boundaries to be super-
symmetric, one needs among other terms a specic pair of gaugino interaction terms:

(18)

where i = 1, 2 labels the walls and x5
(2) = 0. we write these terms in this form
to stress that they should be interpreted as boundary terms. indeed, the rst, non-singular
term is simply the well-known coupling of the ten-dimensional gauginos to the antisymmetric
tensor eld. since the product (x11) (x11  0) vanishes, the combination of terms involving
g11abc and ten-dimensional gauginos  (18) can be written as a bulk perfect-square action:

we have retained in this expression only these parts of the gauge chern-simons forms which give
rise to couplings between zero modes arising from the compactication of the six-dimensional
internal space, and are directly related to the low-energy eective superpotential.

m n = (e2g(5)

since, in this section, we rst construct the ve-dimensional theory, we perform the weyl
rotation of the metric which gives the canonical einstein-hilbert action in ve dimensions. the
relation between the canonical eleven- and ve-dimensional metrics is g(11)
 ; eg(0)
ab ).
in this notation, we take e3 = re(s), where s is the z2-even scalar from the universal
hypermultiplet [10, 11]. this ve-dimensional moduli s, t, u should not be confused with
the four-dimensional chiral superelds encountered in the previous section, which we denote
by s, t , u when necessary in this section.
in what follows, we shall use the same symbols
both for other ve-dimensional moduli, e.g., , , and for the corresponding four-dimensional
quantum elds, whenever it is obvious from the context which we actually have in mind. we
need the decompositions of eleven-dimensional spinors l(x, y) = l(x)  +(y), where + is
the covariantly-constant spinor of positive chirality 7. the corresponding decomposition of 
matrices is m

where the kj
i (y) are harmonic (1, 1)-forms, and the tjp are generators of e6. we note the
following properties of the generators: trtiptjqtkr = ijkdpqr, trtjptj p = jj pp, and the
appropriate expansions for the eld strength: fa  c kpkj

finally, we shall use the following decomposition of the regular part of gabc11 in terms of

to construct the eective theory in four dimensions, one has to integrate out the components
of the ve-dimensional elds which do not correspond to massless degrees of freedom in four
dimensions, and the natural way to do this is through the solution of the equations of motion
along the dimension which one wishes to compactify. to the lowest order in 2/3, i.e., to the
zeroth order in 0, the equation is

where the subscript m = 1, 2 denotes the restriction of the given function to the mth wall.
we note that the coecients of the gaugino bilinears above would dier in higher order in
0 (see (23)). the eective four-dimensional lagrangian is obtained by substituting (25) into
lagrangian (22) and then integrating over the coordinate x5.

we need to comment on the next-order corrections to the above solution. as we stressed
earlier, higher-order corrections to (25) cannot be reliably calculated from the lagrangian (22).
it turns out that, in order to nd the corrections reliably and to reconstruct the complete four-
dimensional lagrangian at higher order in , it would be necessary to go beyond the linear order
in the x5 dependence of the eld c0, hence beyond the order to which the eective lagrangian
can be trusted. secondly, the compactication 11  5 leads in general to a nonlinear -
model structure which goes beyond the simple expression (22): as pointed out in [11], in ve
dimensions the perfect square (22) is a part of the larger nonlinear -model structure

when we expand the quaternionic metric up to linear order in all the elds except s. there exist

conguration, but they do not contain observable elds. hence, as far as the matter elds and
gaugino couplings are concerned, the relevant couplings to moduli are in (26). we reiterate
that nonlinearities are to be expected in the solution of the full theory in ve dimensions, since
it contains nonlinear terms associated with gauging, as well as with the nonlinear  model
structure.

it is useful to summarize certain properties of the zeroth-order result (25). first, we re-
call [10, 11] that the the order parameter for supersymmetry breaking in the microscopic ve-
dimensional vacuum is the non-vanishing vev of 5c0 if we compactify on a calabi-yau space
with h(2,1) = 0: see (29) below for the general case with h(2,1) > 0. secondly, (25) expresses this
quantity in terms of elds charged under the gauge group, which are legitimate zero modes in
the eective four-dimensional theory. we see that the terms corresponding to superpotentials
generated on separate walls enter this expression additively, which is simply the minimal struc-
ture for building the eective four-dimensional supergravity. this is not surprising, knowing
the way the parts of the superpotential add up in the eective lagrangian derived from the
weakly-coupled string, but the low-energy superpotential could in principle be a non-trivial
chiral function of w 1 and w 2. thirdly, the terms corresponding to gaugino bilinears enter
the expression (25) with coecients that are equal to the order to which we have solved the
corresponding equation of motion. we shall now discuss some of these points in more detail.

in the ve-dimensional approach which we assumed in this section, following [10, 11], it is
straightforward to identify the terms that violate the four low-energy supersymmetries, namely,
the terms containing couplings of the charged elds to the derivative 5c0, assuming this
derivative acquires a vev. the full set of supersymmetry-breaking terms, which are all soft, can
be summarized as

(28)

where the subscripts m denote the values of the corresponding ve-dimensional elds on the
mth wall. modulo certain details to be discussed below, we see in (28) soft terms that are
proportional to p (m) and trilinear in matter scalars, which were unnoticed in early papers, and
soft gaugino masses, in both the hidden and the visible sectors. terms which are absent above
include nonchiral soft scalar masses. this absence of soft scalar masses is directly related to
the form of the bulk-wall coupling, i.e., to the form of the perfect-square coupling, which was
a consequence of eleven-dimensional supersymmetry, in the order to which the horava-witten
lagrangian was constructed. the deeper reason for the absence of explicit scalar masses is
that we are only compactifying the eleven-dimensional eld theory and not the full strongly-
coupled string theory, i.e., we do not perform the equivalent of the orbifold compactication in
the weakly-coupled string, since the full theory is currently inaccessible only in the strongly-
coupled limit.

in order to see how the soft terms found above would look in the presence of the non-
universal hypermultiplets in the bulk, i.e., for calabi-yau spaces with hodge number h(2,1) > 0,

10

we recall [11] that one has to make the replacement

25c0 

2

1  |z a|2 (5c0 + 5caz a)

(29)

in the expression (28), where a = 1, ..., h(2,1) labels z2-odd (ca) and z2-even (z a) scalars from
the non-universal hypermultiplets. the presence of the derivatives 5ca signals that, in addition
to the f terms of the universal moduli s, t there will be f terms of the non-universal (2, 1)
u moduli participating in the breaking of supersymmetry at low energy.

we now discuss the interpretation of the solution (25) from the point of view of the low-
energy supergravity lagrangian. first of all, we note once more that, if we switch o the
gaugino bilinears, then what is left in 5c0 is the scalar component of the superpotential,
which happens to be the sum of the superpotentials from individual walls. this is exactly what
we expect from the point of view of the four-dimensional supergravity, but it could not be taken
for granted from the beginning. our procedure is the only way to recover all the supergravity
terms involving the scalar component of the superpotential, which we take as a clear sign that
integrating out the fth dimension, as done here, is the canonical way of recovering the correct
four-dimensional eective theory. we now consider the eect of switching on the gaugino
condensates. it is clear that they can be regarded as eectively non-dynamical parts of the
superpotential in the infrared limit. the consistent way to summarize these observations is to
write

where (using g55 = e2):

5c0 =

is the eective low-energy superpotential generated on the mth wall. this identication clearly
can be done at the level of the lowest-order solution for 5c0. there, the condensates enter with
exactly the same coecients, and one can conclude that the four-dimensional scalar potential
obtained from the solution (25) is that the one of the four-dimensional supergravity with f1,2 =
s: this leads to

case, we immediately recover the original conclusion drawn in eleven dimensions [16], namely
that two condensates on opposite walls with the same magnitudes and opposite phases result
in unbroken supersymmetry. this is in contrast to the result obtained previously in four-
dimensional supergravity with gauge kinetic functions linear in 0. however, the rederivation
of the result of [16] in ve dimensions on the basis of (25) in the latter case, with higher order
corrections switched on, is misleading, since it is the dynamics which must choose the physical
conguration of elds from the family of all those possible, which we have not yet fully taken
into account. we come back to an explanation of this point at the end of this section.

actually, the above is not the only way in which supersymmetry breaking due to condensates
can be modied. one should note that the reduction of the ten-dimensional chern-simons

11

forms (including the gravitational ones) can result not only in trilinear terms p (m), but also
in constant terms, corresponding to non-zero uxes of the gauge and tangent vacuum bundles.
these terms, which are constant from the four-dimensional point of view, might also cancel
condensates, causing the vev of 5c0 to vanish. to decide what is the actual vev controlling
supersymmetry breaking is a dynamical problem, which can be addressed in the context of the
results of the present paper. unfortunately, as predicted already in [11], the eective potential
which one obtains has a runaway direction.

lacking clearer options, we assume whenever necessary that, if 5c0 is non-zero, then it
is of the order of the eective condensation scale 3/20. in this connection, we observe on
the basis of the exact expression (28) that soft terms born on a given wall are proportional to
5c0|m. i.e., the derivative of c0 computed locally on that wall. there is no ve-dimensional
averaging involved: soft terms are generated by local interactions on the walls.
this observation is important, as it leads to the next consistency check of the implicit
assumption of the existence of the eective four-dimensional supergravity. the obvious place
to read o the eective superpotential in a given four-dimensional supergravity model is the
gravitino mass term, which is ek/2w in the canonical normalization for the gravitino in four
dimensions. when one reduces the only eleven-dimensional term which can give rise to the
gravitino mass term 8 to lower dimensions, one nds

(34)

we recall rst that 1
2 (+) is indeed ek/2. in order to be consistent with the soft terms found
previously, which are proportional to the local values of the derivative 5c0 on the respective
walls, one must demand that

4e 3

h5c0i = 5c0|(m=1) = 5c0|(m=2)

(35)

one natural and acceptable, but not of course unique, solution to this condition is 5c0 constant,
which is exactly the case for the solution of lowest order in 2/3 which we consider here. the
obvious question is whether there is any need to consider situations when the vacuum solution
for c0 is not exactly linear in x5. the answer is that there exists a natural source of such
nonlinearities - the nonlinear couplings from the non-trivial kahler metric for the bulk moduli,
i.e., the non-trivial  model discussed in [10, 11]. the incorporation of such nonlinear vacuum
solutions into the standard four-dimensional supergravity form lies beyond the scope of this
paper: one may speculate that it could involve eld-theoretical loop corrections.

finally, we would like to discuss in some detail the relation between the ve- and four-
dimensional pictures of supersymmetry breaking. to this end, we rst illustrate the way the

where 3
i is the four-dimensional condensate on the ith wall. the rst term on the right-hand
side of (36) looks like the contribution from the rst wall, and the second like the one from the
other wall. indeed, these terms are very similar to the two expressions for the gaugino bilinears
coming from dierent walls which we obtained in (28), once we take into account the linear
correction to the volume:

qg6(x5)  qg(0)

6 (x5)(1 + 0e(1

)),

(37)

which expresses the dierence between the volumes of the calabi-yau spaces on the two walls.
moreover, we note that 5c0  w (1+2) at the zeroth order in 2/3.
pursuing explicitly this quest for higher-order operators cannot give reliable results because
of the problems discussed above the equation (26). however, we stress that the procedure of
reducing from ve to four dimensions which we have applied here already has many general
features of the exact reduction, and illustrates the way the two spatially-separated gauge sectors
are glued together. this is the case not only in the horava-witten models with spatially
separated 9-branes, but also, we believe, in more general situations like those in type-i/type-
iib orientifold models.

as the next step towards a better understanding of the relation between the ve- and
four-dimensional pictures, we return to the four-dimensional expression for the auxiliary elds
controlling supersymmmetry breaking. we recall that the condition of unbroken supersymmetry
f s = f t = 0 is fulllled if and only if both condensates vanish. on the other hand, in general 9
in the ve-dimensional picture: 5c0 = 13
2, with 1 = 2 in the lowest-order solution.
hence, in ve dimensions, unbroken supersymmetry does not imply 3
2 = 0 as in four
dimensions. the resolution of the puzzle lies in the dynamics. one has to remember that, among
the possible values of the parameter that controls supersymmetry breaking, the allowed ones
are those which extremize the energy functional. in the present case, the relevant contributions
to the energy are the gradient terms corresponding to the derivatives with respect to x5:

1 + 23

1 = 3

ke5 = zm 5

2

s + s

(25c0 + ...)2 +zm 5

(s + s)2 (5s)2 + ... .

(38)

after integrating c0(x5) and s(x5) out using their equations of motion, these terms become
potential-energy terms from the point of view of four dimensions. then, setting 5c0 = 0
does not extremize the full energy functional. since we use dynamical equations of motion to
integrate out non-zero mode parts of c0 and s, the information that 5c0 = 0 is not their
solution when one includes all the corrections, becomes encoded in the structure of the eective

four-dimensional lagrangian. in fact, the property that not only the perfect square but also
other derivatives with respect to x11 are important can be seen already in eleven dimensions,
when one makes the ansatz for the metric reecting the canonical choice of the four-dimensional
moduli  and 10. when one expands the eleven-dimensional einstein-hilbert action in terms
of these variables, one obtains

(39)

which contains not only four-dimensional kinetic terms but also terms quadratic in derivatives
with respect to x11.

it is the total sum of both types of both these and the terms coming from the walls should be
extremized. the fact that gradient energy is, in general, non-zero in the ve-dimensional bulk
is reected in the non-vanishing values of the four dimensional |f s|2 and |f t|2 contributions
to the energy density.

conclusions

we have obtained in this paper soft supersymmetry-breaking operators in perturbative non-
standard embeddings in the horava-witten model of the eective low-energy eld-theory limit
of the strongly-coupled heterotic string. the important feature that we have studied in de-
tail is that, in these models, charged matter lives in two sectors with dierent gauge kinetic
functions on two ten-dimensional walls which are spatially separated. we have also considered
the possibility that gauginos may condense on both walls. we have also studied how such two
sectors combine with each other to form the eective supergravity in four dimensions. we have
shown how the soft supersymmetry-breaking terms are born in such a ve-dimensional picture,
and shown that this picture is consistent, at the level of the lowest-order solution to the equa-
tion of motion along the fth dimension, with the eective four-dimensional results. we have
also shown that integration over the fth dimension gives the structure of a four-dimensional
supergravity with the gauge kinetic functions f1,2 = s at the lowest order in 2/3. we have
found non-universality of the soft terms on dierent walls, which is due to sign dierences in
the gauge kinetic functions and in the corrections to the kinetic functions of charged scalars.

we have argued that mixed f s/f t , and perhaps even f s-dominated, supersymmetry break-
ing may occur in the class of models discussed here, and, we believe, also in their counterparts
in more general constructions with dierent gauge sectors separated in higher dimensions. we
also believe that other considerations in this paper should be helpful in more general situations,
like type i/type iib orientifold models with gauge sectors located on dierent branes.

during the completion of this project, we learnt of the forthcoming work of j.p. derendinger
and r. sauser [14], which addresses the problem of constructing the eective low-energy eec-
tive supergravity in also in the presence of ve-branes in the eleven-dimensional bulk. we thank
