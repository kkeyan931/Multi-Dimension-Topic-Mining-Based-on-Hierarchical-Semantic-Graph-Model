abstract: in this talk i review and generalize an idea of seiberg that an n = 1 supersymmetric
gauge theory shows connement without breaking of chiral symmetry when the gauge symmetry of its
magnetic dual is completely broken by the higgs eect. it is shown how the conning spectrum of a
supersymmetric gauge theory can easily be derived when a magnetic dual is known and this method
is applied to many models containing elds in second rank tensor representations and an appropriate
tree-level superpotential.

1. introduction

due to holomorphicity properties and non-renor-
malization theorems valid in n = 1 supersym-
metric theories it has become possible to argue
that some supersymmetric gauge theories with
special matter content conne at low energies.
the rst example is due to seiberg [1] who found
that supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics
(sqcd) with gauge group su (nc) and nf quark
avors shows connement when nf = nc or nf =
nc + 1. this has been generalized to more com-
plicated models. all n = 1 supersymmetric
gauge theories with vanishing tree-level super-
potential which conne at low energies could be
classied [2, 3, 4] because they are constrained
by an index argument. when a tree-level su-
perpotential is present the index argument is no
longer valid. because of the lower symmetry
the non-perturbative superpotential is less con-
strained and one expects more conning models
to exist. indeed, csaki and murayama [5] showed
that many of the kutasov-like [6] models exhibit
connement for special values of the number of
quark avors nf .1 these models contain elds in
tensor representations of the gauge group and an
appropriate superpotential for these tensor elds.

1some further conning models with non-vanishing

tree-level superpotential are discussed in [7].

for all of the models considered in [5] a dual de-
scription in terms of magnetic variables is known
[6, 8, 9, 10] and the authors of [5] used the fact
that the electric gauge theory connes when its
magnetic dual is completely higgsed.

seiberg already used this idea as an addi-
tional consistency check in his original paper es-
tablishing electric-magnetic duality for non-abel-
ian n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories [11].
he showed how the conning superpotential of
sqcd with nf = nc + 1 could be obtained by
a perturbative calculation in the completely bro-
ken magnetic gauge theory. under duality the
elds of the magnetic theory (which are gauge
singlets as the gauge symmetry is completely bro-
ken) are mapped to the mesons and baryons of
the electric theory and the conning superpo-
tential is easily shown to be the image of the
magnetic superpotential under this mapping [11].
this a realization in n = 1 supersymmetric gauge
theories of an old idea of t hooft and mandel-
stam [12] that connement is driven by conden-
sation of magnetic monopoles.

now, many gauge theory models have been
found that possess a dual description in terms of
magnetic variables in the infrared. this allows
us to predict many new examples of conning
gauge theories. the idea described in the previ-

ous paragraph was rst used by the authors of
[13] to determine the conning spectrum of the
model proposed by kutasov [6] and has been ap-
plied by csaki and murayama [5] to six further
models that conne in the presence of an appro-
priate superpotential.

in this talk i review the original example of
seiberg [11] and explain how electric-magnetic
duality is used to obtain the low-energy spectrum
and the form of the non-perturbative superpo-
tential of conning gauge theories [14]. one nds
that all of the gauge theory models based on sim-
ple gauge groups considered in [10, 15] conne
when the gauge groups of their magnetic duals
are completely broken by the higgs eect. for
nine of these theories the conning phase has not
been discussed before.

2. phase structure of sqcd

let us briey review the well-known phase struc-
ture of sqcd [16]. by this we mean an n = 1
supersymmetric su (nc) gauge theory with nf
quark avors, i.e. nf chiral matter supermulti-
plets q transforming in the fundamental repre-
sentation of the gauge group and the same amount
of matter multiplets q transforming in the anti-
fundamental representation. consider rst the
case of vanishing tree-level superpotential. de-
pending on the relative values of nf and nc the
the low-energy theory resides in dierent phases.
nf = 0: this is pure super yang-mills the-
ory. it is believed to show connement. accord-
ing to an index argument by witten [17] there
are nc distinct supersymmetric vacua.

0 < nf < nc: there is a non-perturba-
tive superpotential generated by gluino conden-
sation (for nf < nc  1) or by instantons (for
nf = nc  1), as was shown by aeck, dine
and seiberg [18]:

wnp = (nc  nf )(cid:18) 3ncnf
det m (cid:19)

1

ncnf

,

(2.1)

where  is the dynamically generated scale of the
theory and the meson matrix m is dened by
m ij = qi qj
, i, j = 1, . . . , nf ,  = 1, . . . , nc.
the minimum of the potential lies at innite eld
expectation values and therefore the theory has
no stable vacuum for this range of parameters.

nf = nc:

in this case the superpotential
vanishes even at the non-perturbative level [1].
as a consequence the at directions that param-
etrize the moduli space of vacua are not lifted in
the quantum theory. the low-energy spectrum
is given by the mesons m ij dened above and
the baryons b = det q, b = det q (the quarks
q, q are viewed as (nf  nc)-matrices). the
physical degrees of freedom at low energies being
gauge invariant means that the theory connes.
the classical constraint det m = b b is modied
in the quantum theory [1] to

det m  b b = 2nc .

(2.2)

the expectation values of the mesons and baryons
that satisfy this constraint span the quantum
moduli space. the observation that the expec-
tation values of det m and b b cannot vanish
simultaneously tells us that the chiral symmetry
is spontaneously broken.

nf = nc + 1: there is again a quantum
moduli space, but now the classical constraints
are not modied by quantum eects. in the low-
energy theory they can be derived from the non-
perturbative superpotential [1]

wnp =

bm b  det m

2nf 3

,

(2.3)

where the baryons bi are dened as the deter-
minant of the quark matrix q with the i-th line
omitted. this describes connement without
breaking of the chiral symmetry.

nc + 2  nf  3

2 nc: the low-energy energy
theory is rather complicated and more appropri-
ately described in terms of dual magnetic vari-
ables. the dual magnetic theory is infrared free
for this range of parameters.

3
2 nc < nf < 3nc: at low energies the the-
ory is driven to an infrared xed point of the
renormalization group [11] and resides in a non-
abelian coulomb phase. seiberg found a dual
description of this model [11] by an su (nf nc)
gauge theory with nf (magnetic) quark avors q,
q and n 2
mag which couple
to the magnetic quarks via the superpotential

f additional singlets m ij

wmag = mmagq q .

(2.4)

this magnetic theory ows to the same infrared
xed point. the gauge invariant operators of

both theories are in one-to-one correspondence:

m   mmag ,

(2.5)

b  q()ncnf 3ncnf bmag .

the mass scale  had to be introduced by dimen-
sional analysis. the three scales , mag and 
are related by

3ncnf 3(nf nc)nf

mag

= (1)nf nc nf .

(2.6)
nf > 3nc: in the infrared the theory ows
to the trivial xed point of free quarks and glu-
ons.

3. connement from duality

let us consider deformations [11] of the theory
described in the previous section by mass terms
w = tr(mm ), where m is an (nf  nf )-matrix
of rank p. by the duality mapping (2.5) this cor-
responds to adding a term  tr(mmmag) to the
superpotential (2.4) in the magnetic theory (cf
gure 1). as our treatment of sqcd is restricted
to the (wilsonian) low-energy eective action we
have to integrate out the massive modes from
the deformed model. in the electric theory this
just leads to a reduction of the number of quark
avors by p. therefore the low-energy theory is
an su (nc) gauge theory with nf  p quark a-
vors and vanishing superpotential w = 0.
in
the magnetic theory, integrating out the massive
components of mmag leads to non-vanishing ex-
pectation values for q, q and thus the gauge sym-
metry is broken spontaneously. the low-energy
theory is an su (nf  nc  p) gauge theory with
nf  p quark avors and superpotential wmag =
mmag qq, where hats denote the low-energy elds.
one nds that the two eective theories are again
dual to each other [11], as shown in gure 1.

it is interesting to consider the special case
p = nf  nc  1. then one has an eective
su (nc) gauge theory with nc + 1 quark avors
on the electric side. the magnetic gauge sym-
metry is completely broken by the higgs eect.
however, one color component of each of the
nc +1 quark avors stays massless after the sym-
metry breaking. these 2(nc + 1) gauge singlets

are denoted by q, q. they couple to the me-
son singlets mmag via the tree-level superpoten-
tial (2.4). due to non-renormalization theorems
this is not corrected in perturbation theory. but
there are non-perturbative corrections generated
by instantons. the full superpotential of the low-
energy magnetic theory reads [11]

wmag = mmag qq + 3nf

mag det mmag.

(3.1)

from the fact that all physical degrees of free-
dom of the eective magnetic theory are gauge
invariant one expects that, as a consequence of
the duality mapping, the degrees of freedom of
the electric theory are gauge singlets as well. we
will see that this intuition is right. the mapping
(2.5) gives

m   mmag ,

(3.2)

b  p12nf 3 q ,

and the scale matching (2.6) now reads

2nf 33nf

mag = nf .

(3.3)

the eective electric theory is described by the
mesons m and the baryons b, b. one can check
that the t hooft anomaly matching conditions
[19] are satised for this low-energy spectrum.
these conditions require that if one gauges the
global symmetries of the theory then the values of
the various triangle anomalies (which in general
will not vanish) must coincide for the microscopic
description in terms of quarks and gluons and the
macroscopic description in terms of mesons and
baryons. performing this calculation one nds
that the mesons and baryons obtained from the
duality mapping (3.2) are just the right degrees
of freedom to match the global anomalies of the
microscopic theory. this means that the theory
is in the conning phase [1], in agreement with
the result for nf = nc+1 of the previous section.
it is easy to determine the full superpotential of
the eective electric theory by applying the dual-
ity mapping (3.2) to the magnetic superpotential
(3.1). using the scale relation (3.3) one nds

w =

bm b  det m

2nf 3

,

(3.4)

which coincides with the superpotential (2.3) found
in the previous section for nf = nc + 1.

theory is deformed correspondingly. after having integrated out the massive modes one nds two eective
theories that are again dual to each other. displayed are the tree-level contributions to the superpotentials.

4. generalizations

the results on sqcd described in the previous
sections have been generalized to other gauge
theory models involving dierent gauge groups
and/or matter elds transforming in representa-
tions other than the fundamental. for each of
these models the electric theory shows conne-
ment without breaking of the chiral symmetry
when the gauge symmetry of its magnetic dual
is completely broken.

4.1 other gauge groups

the simplest extension of the results on sqcd
described above consists in gauge theories with
orthogonal or symplectic gauge groups. let us
rst consider an so(nc) gauge theory with nf
matter elds q (quarks) transforming in the vec-
tor representation of the gauge group and vanish-
ing tree-level superpotential. this has a dual de-
scription [11, 20] in terms of a magnetic so(nf +
4nc) gauge theory with nf quarks q transform-
ing in the vector representation and 1
2 nf (nf +1)
meson singlets mmag that couple to the magnetic
quarks via wmag = mmagqq. the gauge invari-
ant operators of both theories are in one-to-one
correspondence to each other by a mapping very
similar to (2.5). for nf = nc  3 the magnetic
theory is completely higgsed, and one nds that
the electric theory connes. the conning spec-
trum (mesons m and baryons b) as well as the
correct conning superpotential

an sp(2nc) gauge theory with 2nf quarks
q transforming in the fundamental representa-
tion and vanishing tree-level superpotential can
equivalently be described [22] by an sp(2(nf 
2  nc)) gauge theory with 2nf quarks q and
nf (2nf  1) meson singlets mmag that couple to
the magnetic quarks via wmag = mmagqq. the
duality mapping between the gauge invariant op-
erators of the two theories is simply given by
m   mmag; there are no baryons in symplec-
tic gauge theories. for nf = nc +2 the magnetic
theory is completely higgsed, and one nds that
the electric theory connes. the conning spec-
trum (mesons m ) can be obtained from the ef-
fective magnetic theory via the duality mapping.
to obtain the correct conning superpotential

w =

2nf 3

(4.2)

more care is needed, because it is due to instan-
ton corrections in the eective magnetic gauge
theory.

4.2 gauge theories containing tensor elds

for any n = 1 supersymmetric model with van-
ishing tree-level superpotential the form of the
most general superpotential that can possibly be
generated by non-perturbative eects is complete-
ly xed by the requirement that it be invariant
under all symmetries of the considered model
[18, 23, 2]. for a theory with gauge group g
and chiral matter elds l in representations rl
of g and dynamically generated scale  one nds

w =

can be obtained from the eective magnetic the-
ory via the duality mapping.

where l is the (quadratic) dynkin index of the
representation rl, g denotes the index of the

adjoint representation,  = pl l  g and b =
2 (3g  pl l) is the coecient of the 1-loop

-function. in general the complete non-pertur-
bative superpotential consists of a sum of terms
of the form (4.3) with dierent possible contrac-
tions of all gauge and avor indices. the rela-
tive coecients of these terms cannot be xed by
symmetry arguments but must be inferred from
a dierent reasoning.

if the theory is conning at every point of
the moduli space then the superpotential must
either vanish or be a smooth function of the con-
ned degrees of freedom [2]. all such models with
a smooth conning superpotential could be clas-
sied [2] as they have to verify the constraint
 = 2. but only for some of these smoothly
conning gauge theories containing tensor elds
a dual description in terms of magnetic variables
is known.

on the other hand many dualities for mod-
els including tensor elds have been found once
an appropriate tree-level superpotential for the
tensors is added. let us review one example
rst studied by the authors of [6]. they con-
sidered an su (nc) gauge theory with nf quark
avors q, q, an additional matter eld x in the
adjoint representation and a tree-level superpo-
tential wtree = tr x k+1, where k > 1 is some
integer. this model has a dual description in
terms of an su (knf  nc) gauge theory with
nf quark avors q, q, an adjoint tensor y , kn 2
f
singlets mmag,j, j = 0, . . . , k  1 and tree-level
superpotential

wmag = tr y k+1 +

k1

xj=0

mmag,k1j qy j q . (4.4)

for nc = knf  1 the magnetic theory is com-
pletely higgsed and one expects the electric the-
ory to conne. indeed, one nds that the t hooft
anomaly matching conditions are satised if the
conned spectrum of the electric theory is given
by [13]

j = 0, . . . , k  1 ,

mj = qx j q ,
b = (q)nf    (x k1q)nf (x kq)nf 1 ,
b = ( q)nf    (x k1 q)nf (x k q)nf 1 ,

(4.5)

where the gauge indices are contracted with a
kronecker delta for the mesons and with an ep-

5

silon tensor of rank nc for the baryons. in ad-
dition the avor indices of the baryons are con-
tracted with an epsilon tensor of rank knf leav-
ing 2nf independent baryons. it is easy to see
[14] that these are exactly the degrees of free-
dom that are mapped under duality on the mag-
netic singlets mmag,j, q, q that stay massless after
the higgs eect. the matching of the t hooft
anomalies between the microscopic (i.e. quarks
and gluons) and the macroscopic (i.e. conned)
description of the electric theory can thus be seen
as a consequence of the anomaly matching be-
tween the electric and the magnetic theory. in
this sense connement can be derived from dual-
ity.

it is straightforward to apply this idea to all
gauge theory models of [10, 15] based on simple
gauge groups. one rst builds the gauge invari-
ant composite operators whose expectation val-
ues span the moduli space, then nds the duality
mapping between the electric and the magnetic
theory for these operators and nally applies this
mapping to the completely higgsed eective mag-
netic theory to obtain the conned spectrum of
the electric theory.
in addition, in most cases
at least some of the terms of the conning su-
perpotential can be determined from the mag-
netic tree-level superpotential. to constrain the
possible form of the conning superpotential we
would like to generalize the formula (4.3) to the
case of a non-vanishing tree-level superpotential.
therefore divide the matter elds into two sub-
sets {l} = { l}  { l}, with { l}  { l} = ,
and add a tree-level term for the hatted elds:

wtree = h yl (cid:16) l(cid:17)nl

,

(4.6)

where h is a dimensionful coupling parameter
and the nl are positive integers. to be invariant
under all global symmetries the full superpoten-
tial must be of the form [14]

w  (cid:18)ql( l)l

b

(cid:19)

yl (cid:16) l(cid:17)l

h ,

(4.7)

where the powers , l,  must verify the follow-
ing relations:

 = 1  1

2  ,
l = l  + nl .

to illustrate the ideas presented above i would
like to treat one of the models of [14] in more
detail. consider an su (nc) gauge theory with
nf + 8 quarks q, nf antiquarks q, an anti-
symmetric tensor x and a conjugate symmetric
tensor x and tree-level superpotential wtree =
h tr(x x)2(k+1). this is a chiral theory and the
dierence between the number of quarks and an-
tiquarks is required by anomaly freedom. the
gauge invariant composite operators are given by

mj = q q(j) , pr = q xq(r) , pr = qx q(r) ,

with q(j) = (x x)jq , q(j) = ( xx)j q ,

b, b  q, q and b  y . one color component of
each of the elds q, q, y together with the meson
singlets are exactly the degrees of freedom that
stay massless after breaking the magnetic gauge
group.

as a further consistency check let us consider
deformations of the theory along the at direc-
tions corresponding to large expectation values of

the baryons b, b. a large vev of b breaks the
gauge symmetry to sp(2((2k + 1)(nf + 4)  2))
[10]. the low-energy theory contains 2(nf + 4)
quarks q, a symmetric tensor x and tree-level
superpotential tr x 2(k+1). this model is known
to show connement [5]. a large vev of b breaks
the gauge symmetry to so(2(2k +1)(nf +4)+3)
[10]. the low-energy theory contains 2(nf + 4)
quarks q, an antisymmetric tensor x and tree-
level superpotential tr x 2(k+1). this model is
known to show connement [5].

the eective low-energy superpotential of the
magnetic theory contains the terms m2k+1q q +
p2kq y q. we thus expect that the conning su-
perpotential of the electric theory has terms pro-
portional to bm2k+1b, bbp2kb. the detailed

ered by seiberg can be used to nd new mod-
els that conne in the presence of an appropri-
ate superpotential. this is a very interesting ap-
plication of the proposed duality because it en-
ables us to obtain non-perturbative results for
the electric theory by a perturbative calculation
in its magnetic dual. connement in the electric
theory can be understood from the higgs phase
of the magnetic theory. the conning spectrum
can easily be derived from the duality mappings
of gauge invariant operators. for su and so
gauge groups one also obtains the form of the
conning superpotential by applying these map-
pings to the magnetic tree-level superpotential.
to determine the full conning superpotential
one needs to include instanton corrections in the
completely broken magnetic gauge group. for
sp gauge groups the tree-level superpotential of
the completely higgsed magnetic theory vanishes.
in this case the whole magnetic superpotential is
non-perturbative and therefore more dicult to
obtain.
