abstract

solutions in multidimensional gravity with m p -branes related to toda-like
systems (of general type) are obtained. these solutions are dened on a product
of n + 1 ricci-at spaces m0  m1  . . .  mn and are governed by one harmonic
function on m0 . the solutions are dened up to the solutions of laplace and toda-
type equations and correspond to null-geodesics of the (sigma-model) target-space
metric. special solutions relating to am toda chains (e.g. with m = 1, 2 ) are
considered.

introduction

at present there exists a special interest to the so-called m theory (see, for example,
[1]-[2]). this theory is supermembrane analogue of superstring models [3] in d = 11 .
the low-energy limit of m -theory after a dimensional reduction leads to models governed
by a lagrangian containing metric, elds of forms and scalar elds. these models contain
a large variety of so-called p -brane solutions (see [4]-[42] and references therein).

in [25] it was shown that after dimensional reduction on the manifold m0 m1 . . .
mn and when the composite p -brane ansatz for elds of forms is considered the problem
is reduced to the gravitating self-interacting  -model with certain constraints imposed.
(for electric p -branes see also [16, 17, 26].) this representation may be considered as
a powerful tool for obtaining dierent solutions with intersecting p -branes (analogues
of membranes).
in [25, 26, 36, 37, 38] the majumdar-papapetrou type solutions (see
[45]) were obtained (for non-composite case see [16, 17]). these solutions correspond
to ricci-at (mi, gi) , ( gi
is metric on mi ) i = 1, . . . , n , and were also generalized to
the case of einstein internal spaces [25]. earlier some special classes of these solutions
were considered in [8, 9, 11, 19, 20, 21]. the obtained solutions take place, when certain
(block-)orthogonality relations (on couplings parameters, dimensions of branes, total di-
mension) are imposed. in this situation a class of cosmological and spherically-symmetric
solutions was obtained [31, 40]. special cases were also considered in [12, 27, 29, 30]. the
solutions with the horizon were considered in details in [7, 22, 23, 31, 33].

in models under consideration there exists a large variety of toda-chain solutions,
when certain intersection rules are satised [31]. cosmological and spherically symmetric
solutions with p -branes and n internal spaces related to am toda chains were previously
considered in [12, 13] and [39, 42].

it is well known that geodesics of the target space equipped with some harmonic
function on a three-dimensional space generate a solution to the  -model equations
[46, 47]. (it was observed in [48] that null geodesics of the target space of stationary
ve-dimensional kaluza-klein theory may be used to generate multisoliton solutions sim-
ilar to the israel-wilson-perj`es solutions of einstein-maxwell theory.) here we apply this
null-geodesic method to our sigma-model and obtain a new class of solutions in multidi-
mensional gravity with p -branes governed by one harmonic function h . the solutions
from this class correspond to null-geodesics of the target-space metric and are dened by
some functions fs(h) = exp(qs(h)) with qs(u) being solutions to toda-type equations.

ii the model

we consider a model governed by the action [25]

s = z ddzq|g|(cid:26)r[g]  hgm n m n   xa
where g = gm n dzm  dzn is a metric,  = ()  rl
is a vector of scalar elds, (h)

we also put  () = () = 1 and d() = 0 .

for elds of forms we consider the following composite electromagnetic ansatz

where

f (a,e,i) = d(a,e,i)   (i),

there are no two p -branes with the same color index a , a   .) restriction 1 and 2
forbid certain intersections of two p -branes with the same color index for n1  2 and
n1  1 respectively.
it was proved in [25] that equations of motion for the model (2.1) and the bianchi
identities: df s = 0 , s  sm , for elds from (2.3)(2.13), when restrictions 1 and 2 are

here we consider exact solutions to eld equations corresponding to the action (3.1)

we put

where f : (u, u+)  rn is a smooth function, h : m0  r is a harmonic function on
m0 , i.e.

x a(x) = f a(h(x)),

satisfying u < h(x) < u+ for all x  m0 .

the substitution of (3.7) into eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) leads us to the relations

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

i = 0, . . . , n . in this case the potential is zero : v = 0 and the eld equations (3.9)
and (3.10) are satised identically if f = f (u) obey the lagrange equations for the
lagrangian

with the zero-energy constraint

l =

1

2g a b(f ) f a f b

e =

1

2g a b(f ) f a f b = 0.

this means that f : (u, u+)  rn is a null-geodesic map for the minisupermetric (3.2).
thus, we are led to the lagrange system (3.12) with the minisupermetric g dened in
(3.4).
the problem of integrability may be simplied if we integrate the lagrange equations
corresponding to s (i.e. the maxwell equations for s  se and bianchi identities for
s  sm ):

where qs are constants, s  s . here (f a) = (za, s) . we put

qs 6= 0,

(3.15)

for all s  s .
for xed q = (qs, s  s) the lagrange equations for the lagrangian (3.12) corre-
sponding to (za) = (i, ) , when equations (3.14) are substituted, are equivalent to the
lagrange equations for the lagrangian

eq =

gab za zb + vq = 0.

iii.2 toda-type solutions

let us dene the scalar product as follows

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)
for u, u   rn+l , where ( gab) = ( gab)1 . the scalar products (3.19) for vectors u s
were calculated in [25]

(u, u ) = gabuau

(u s, u s

) = d(is  is) +

2  d

+ ssasas h,

(3.20)

where (h) = (h)1 ; s = (as, vs, is) and s = (as, vs, is) belong to s .

here we are interested in exact solutions for a special case when the vectors u s  rn+l

satisfy the following conditions

for all s  s , and a (quasi-cartan) matrix

ks = (u s, u s) 6= 0,

(ass) =   2(u s, u s)
(u s, u s)!

(3.21)

(3.22)

is a non-degenerate one. here some ordering in s is assumed.
it follows from (3.21)
and the non-degeneracy of the matrix (3.22) that the vectors u s, s  s, are linearly
independent. hence, the number of the vectors u s should not exceed the dimension of
rn+l , i.e.

|s|  n + l.

let k > 0 . then et  0 and hence some of bi should be negative.
let b1 < 0 and b2 < 0 . in the pseudo-euclidean case, when [g] = 1 and all
a = 1 , this means that si = (isi) = 1 , i = 1, 2 , (see (2.21)), i.e. all p -branes should
contain an odd number of time submanifolds.

a2 -solution, describing a dyon conguration with electric 2 -brane and magnetic 5 -brane,
corresponding to 4-form f and intersecting in 1-dimensional time manifold reads:

g = c2/9( h 2g0  h 2dt  dt) + c8/9g1 + c4/9g2,

sponds to the degenerate solution (4.35). here the following notations h = h(|q1||q2|)1/2

vii conclusions

here we obtained a family of solutions in multidimensional gravity with p -branes gen-
eralizing majumdar-papapetrou type solutions from [25, 36] in a special case of one
harmonic function. these solutions are related to toda-like systems (of general type)
and are dened up to the solutions of laplace and toda-type equations. we considered
special solutions corresponding to am toda lattices (written in a parametrization of a.
andersen [51]). the general solutions may be also used for other open toda lattices, e.g.
corresponding to bm , cm , dm series. the solutions also contain a class of cosmolog-
ical and spherically symmetric solutions and may be used for investigation of possible
black hole and wormhole congurations.
