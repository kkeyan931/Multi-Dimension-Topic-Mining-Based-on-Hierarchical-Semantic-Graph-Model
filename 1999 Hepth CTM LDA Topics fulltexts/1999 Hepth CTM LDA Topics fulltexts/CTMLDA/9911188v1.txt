abstract

no positive result has been obtained on the magnetic monopole search. this allows to
consider dierent theoretical approaches as the proposed in this paper. the second rank
skew-symmetrical elds are the basis of electromagnetic theories. in the space-time the hodge
duality of these elds is narrowly related with the rotations in the so(2) group. the maxwell
equations are found as a property of this eld type. usually these equations are associated
to the electromagnetic eld, however the thesis of this paper means that these equations
are associated with an abstract eld class. these equations are space-time properties rather
than semantic properties of any specic eld. by developing this thesis a type of magnetic
monopoles are found which dier from the usual concept, because magnetic and electric
charges become mutually neutral, by supposing initially the opposite hypothesis. this result
arises by erasing the dummy terms in the lagrange function. duality invariant expressions
are proposed for the maxwell equations, the stress-energy tensor and the lagrange function.
it is concluded that the magnetic charges, as the neutrino, must be very evasive particles.

introduction

the concept of magnetic monopole extends the meaning of the maxwell equations, by providing a
symmetric view of electric and magnetic elds. the asymmetry of these equations has been for a long
time a motivational phenomenon in both the theoretical[1, 2] and experimental[3] aspects. according
with hawking and ross[4], the belief that electrically and magnetically charged black holes have identical
quantum properties provides a new interest in all questions related with electromagnetic duality[5, 6, 7, 8].
additionally, as asserted by lee[5], the magnetic monopole dynamic is related to strongly interacting
elementary particles. most of the works in electromagnetic duality are dealing with quantum aspect,
while as appointed by israelit[9, 10], little attention is considered to construct a correct classical theory
in the general relativistic arena. the classical theory can be considered as a limit of quantum theory,
thus advances in the rst can be useful to the second[11]. the construction of a classical theory of
electromagnetic duality is not a closed matter. a pending problem deals with the duality invariance of
both the stress-energy tensor and the lagrange action[4, 8, 12].

in classical eld theory, if the electromagnetic eld is constructed from a potential vector as: fab =
2[aab], thus the vanishing of the second set of maxwell equations, [afbc] = 0, is due to a property
of the riemann curvature tensor: rd
[abc] = 0. the denition of the eld or the ane properties of
the space-time must be changed to obtain a full electromagnetic duality with symmetrical maxwell
equations. first type of theories can include dierent eld denitions from the potential vector, as
in the yang-mills model based on gauge theories[6, 13]. second type of theories can include torsion
properties in the space-time, as based on weil geometry[9, 14]. any theory which modies some of these

aspects can generate a non-vanishing second set of maxwell equations, and consequently some type of
magnetic monopolar current.

electromagnetic duality is related with the symmetrical role of electric and magnetic elds in the
maxwell equations. the hodge duality is a useful tool to deal with this equation symmetry. it becomes
a cornerstone to connect the physical and the mathematical concepts of duality. the double duality
transformation in fourth dimensional space-time generates an identity with negative sign. from far,
this fact has been qualitatively associated with the rotation in a plane[15][p 108]. however, a recent
interest arises in the symplectic structure of the electromagnetic equations[16, 17] and also in the so(2)
symmetrical group embedded in the duality[18, 19, 20, 21]. chan and tsou[22, 23] show some of the
problems with duality in the classical theory. they extend duality to nonabelian gauge theory. in this
case, the magnetic monopoles appear due to the commutator term of the gauge derivative.

the approach of this paper is related with an axiomatic viewpoint about the formal generation
and properties of the maxwell equations. this carries us towards a more basic matter. the basic
elements used in physics theories are the space-time with its geometrical structure and the matter elds
representing distributions of mass, energy and charge[24]. the equations used in these theories involve
symbols having some type of empirical counterpart, meaning or semantic. most of the equations can
be grouped in two main classes. first class is related with the formal framework, including the space-
time and the representation properties. in general relativity, the space-time is of riemann type, and
elds are represented by tensor distributions. first class can be named syntactic or structural, because
their equations reect the structure of the formal framework. second class can be named semantic,
because their equations are related with the meaning and experimental properties of represented symbols.
deductive and inductive methods are used mainly with rst and second class respectively. however,
sometime the structural and semantic concepts are strongly joined and cannot be easily distinguished,
as well as inductive and deductive method are frequently mixed.

the maxwell equations are usually identied with the electromagnetic eld. the main thesis of
this work is that maxwell-like equations are framework properties rather than specic properties of the
electromagnetic eld. that is: the maxwell equations are syntactic or structural rather than semantic.
if this thesis is veried, it is possible to consider a family of electromagnetic-like elds, thus the called
electromagnetic eld is one of included in this family. proving this thesis is carried out by showing that
these equations arise deductively from a simple formal set of denitions and propositions related with a
wide tensor class.

the plan of this paper is as follows. the sec. 2 contains most of the mathematical tools used
along the paper. it is being presented in a formal way comprising a set of denitions, propositions and
theorems, including also most of the deductive machinery. this section is partially an experiment in
order to nd a reduced set of mathematical elements needed to construct the basic of an axiomatic
electromagnetic theory. the sec. 3 presents the equations of the electromagnetic eld as are deduced
from the axiomatic. the sec. 4 deals with the duality invariance, including an invariant formulation for
the maxwell equations and the stress-energy tensor. this invariance connect with the rotations in the
so(2) group. the sec. 5 presents a model of lagrange function. finally, the sec. 6 is related with the
particle-eld and particle-particle interactions.

2 the axiomatic of class em
the tensor class em is described as a tensor family with a common property. a set of denitions,
propositions and theorems are formally presented, all are related with equations involving second rank
skew-symmetric tensors in (m, gab). this section is linearly presented, such as most of the propositions
and theorem become immediately proved from previous assertions. in some simple cases the proof section
is omitted. the hodge duality is the basic for electromagnetic duality, so dierential forms are used
because play an important role with skew-symmetric tensor and duality. a p-form and a skew-symmetric
tensor of rank p are equivalent representations used along this section:

x =

1
p!

xa1 apwa1    wap  x[a1 ap]

(1)

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

in a general basis, while for a plane cartesian basics wk = dxk. the wedge product  of a p-form
and a q-form is a (p + q)-form veries: x y = (1)pqy x. the dual of a p-form, x, is a (n p)-form,
x, where n = 4 and 0  p  n. it is dened as[13]:

x =

1

(n  p)!(cid:20) 1

a1 an x a1 ap(cid:21) wap+1    wan

p!

(2)

where abcd is the levi-civita fourth rank completely skew-symmetric tensor, with 0123 = g, and

g is the metric determinant. throughout this paper the dual of rst, second and third rank tensors will
be considered, based on the previous expression they are dened as[15](sec. 3.5):

abcd = abcdaa

bcd =

1
2

abcdbab

cd =

1
3!

abcdc abc

(3)

the double duality veries that: x = (1)p1 x. so it is veried that: a = a, b = b and

c = c.

2.1 linear expressions

for a vector u = uawa the exterior derivative can be expressed from the tensorial derivative as:
(d  u)ab = (d  u)ab  (d  u)ba, so if: d  u = (aub)wa  wb, it is obtained that:

d  u = du = (aub  bua)wa  wb

(4)

for the general case, the derivative of a p-form is a (p + 1)-form expressed in terms of the covariant

derivative[13]:

y = dx  ya1 ap = a1 xa2 ap  a2xa1 ap + (1)pap xa1 ap1

for a scalar , a 1-form u and a 2-form x, it is veried that:

d  a
du  aub  bua = 2[aub]
dx  axbc  bxac + cxab = 3[axbc]

(5)

(6)

(7)
(8)

it is veried that dd = 0, that is dy = 0 in the equation (5). the co-derivative x of a p-form is
a (p  1)-form expressed as: x = dx in the forth dimensional space-time. for a 1-form is veried
that:
(9)
thus, if  is a scalar: d  (cid:3), where (cid:3) = aa is the second order dierential operator. also
(10)

z = x  z = axa

for a 2-form:

z = x  za = bxba

thus, if u is a vector in a curved space-time, it is veried that:

du + du  (cid:3)ua + rb

aub

(11)

where rb

a is the ricci tensor. it is also veried that:  = 0, that is z = 0 in the previous cases.

denition 1. a second rank tensor x is included in em0 class, x  em0, if it is skew-symmetric, it
means that: xab + xba = 0.

denition 2. a tensor x  em1, also called a -eld, if x  em0, and also it veries: dx = 0,
equivalent to: [axbc] = 0.

denition 3. a tensor x  em2, also called a -eld, if x  em0, and also it veries: x = 0,
equivalent to: bx ab = 0.

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

these classes verify that: em1  em0 and em2  em0. two new classes can be introduced,
the rst as intersection of the previous, em3 = em1  em2, which veries that: [axbc] = 0 and
bx ab = 0. the other class is: em4 = em0  em1  em2, which veries that: [axbc] 6= 0 and
bx ab 6= 0.
proposition 1. if x  em0, the third rank tensor 3[axbc] and the vector (1)b
reciprocally, the tensor 3[a

xbc] and the vector bx ab are also dual.

x ab are both dual.

proposition 2. if x  em1, then x  em2, and reciprocally.
proof. if x  em1 then dx = 0, therefore it is veried that: x = dx = dx = 0. the reciprocal
it is also right, if x  em2 then x = 0, therefore it is veried that: dx = (1)2dx = 0.
denition 4. if x  em0, and the vector z is dened as: z = x, that is: za = bxab, it is called
the -current of x, and it veries that: z = 0.

denition 5. if x  em0, and the vector y is dened as: y = x, that is: ya = b xab, it is
called the -current of x, and it veries that: y = 0.

proposition 3. if {z, y} are the  and -current of x, then {y,z} are the  and -current of x.

theorem 2.1 (maxwell-like). any tensor x  em0 veries the next equations, where z and y are
its  and -current respectively.
(12)

x = y

x = z

verifying that z = 0 and y = 0.

remark 1. from proposition 1 these equations can be expressed in tensorial form as:

bx ab = z a

[bxcd] = 

1
3

abcdy a

where az a = 0 and ay a = 0. for the dual x, it is veried that:
abcdz a

x ab = y a

xcd] =

b

[b

1
3

(13)

(14)

these become the symmetrical maxwell-like equations system and the current conservation laws which
are the starting point for the construction of the electromagnetic duality. the em1 or the em2 classes
are obtained if y = 0 or z = 0.

proposition 4. if x  em1, it can be expressed from a vector eld u as:

x = du  xab = aub  bua

(15)

proof. it follows from the poincare lemma[13, 25]. in this case x is closed, dx = 0, then it must be
exact, x = du. however, the vector eld u is not univocally dened, being possible a transformation
as: u = u + d, where  is a scalar eld. it is veried that: du = du, due to: dd = 0. to x this
scalar it is imposed an additional equation as the lorentz gauge: u = 0. this restriction becomes:

d = 0  (cid:3) = 0

(16)

proposition 5. if z is a vector eld verifying z = 0, then exist solution for x  em1 expressed as:
(17)

x = z

dx = 0

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

proof. from the double duality it is concluded that if a p-form is null also is null its dual, so from
z = dz = 0 it is concluded that z is closed. based on the poincare lemma it must be exact, this
is: dx = z, therefore exist x. this is not univocally dened, it is veried that: x = x + v, where
v  em3.
remark 2. an alternative proof can be used for this proposition. based on the previous proposition,
x can be expressed by means of a vector eld as x = du, if this veries the condition: u = 0, it is
obtained that:

this is a general case of a tensorial wave equation in a curved space-time with a eld source. according

 (cid:3)ua + rb

aub = za

(18)

with friedlander[26] there are a solution for u and consequently for x.

theorem 2.2 (splitting). any eld x  em0 can be expressed by means of two auxiliary -elds,
xab and xab, such as:

xab = xab  
xab = xab + 

xab
xab

(19)

(20)

where each auxiliary eld veries the following expressions based on the  and  currents of x:

  x = z
  x = y

(21)
(22)
proof. firstly if x  em1 or x  em2 the theorem is automatically proved by choosing null any of the
two auxiliary elds. the other case is x  em4 with non-null sources. the auxiliary elds x and x
are chosen according with the equations (21) and (22). from the previous proposition it is proved that
there are solution for both elds, however these solutions are not univocally dened. therefore these
solutions can verify that:

x = 0
x = 0

  
  

(23)
however it is obtained that d  em3. due to em3  em1, it can be introduced a new tensor:
ab = (xab + dab)  em1, consequently verifying that: xab = x 

dab = xab  xab + 

xab 6= 0.

ab  

xab.

x 

2.2 bilinear expressions

some useful properties of the tensor class em0 can be obtained by using bilinear expressions. all are
based on a basic property related with a partial double duality transformation.

proposition 6. if the fourth rank tensor h veries that:

habcd = h[ab]cd = hab[cd]

then, it is veried that:

(h )b

a =

bcuv = h b

b
ah

(24)

(25)

where: h b

a = h bc

ac and h = h cd

cd.

proof. it is based on the properties of the  and  skew-symmetric tensors[13](sec. 5.4). e.g. this useful
property is used to dene the einstein tensor directly from the curvature tensor[15](p. 222, 343).

proposition 7. if a and b  em0. it is veried that:
1
bbc = aacbbc

bbc =  aacbbc +
bcd = acdbcd
bcd = acdbcd

proof. the rst is obtained directly from the previous proposition, the second is obtained by using the
bbc. the two last expressions are contraction of the previous.
intermediate step: aac

bbc =  aac

and the symmetric second rank tensor w veries that:

bwab = z bxba + y b xba

proposition 10. the tensor w can be decomposed in three terms:

w = ()w + ()w + ()w

where is veried that:

the last tensor can be simplied by using: n b

x bc. based on proposition 7,
a = 0. thus, it is obtained that: ()wab = (1/2)(nab + nba) =

it is veried that: nab = nba and n a

2.3 vectorial bases in em0
in the fourth dimensional space-time the double duality generates an identity with a minus sign, it
is similar to a double rotation of 90o in a plane as shown in the figure 1. this reveals the so(2)
symmetrical group implicit in the duality concept that is now widely considered[18, 19, 20, 21]. in the
approach of this paper based on the concept of tensor class em0, this rotation is in a formal plane
associated to the classes em1 and em2, which are acting as orthogonal vectorial bases.
proposition 11. if a and b belong to em1 and not to em3, the solution for the equation:

 b + a = 0

(44)

where  and  are constant, is that:  =  = 0, i.e. a and b are lineally independent.

proof. from the previous conditions must be: da = db = 0 and also a 6= 0 and b 6= 0. however it
is veried that from: db + da = 0, it must be:  = 0. also from: b + a = 0, and due that
b =  db = 0, it must be:  = 0. therefore in the general case the em2 class is non-reducible to
em1 and reciprocally because both are lineally independent.

the classes em1 and em2 are acting as orthogonal vectorial bases. it is founded in two properties.
firstly, both classes are lineally independent and orthogonal related by a 90o rotation-like. it can be
qualitatively expressed as: em2 = em1 and em1 = em2. second, based on the theorem 2.2, any
tensor in em0 can be expressed by means of tensors in both classes. it can be qualitatively expressed
as: em0 = em1 + em2
remark 3. if the hodge duality is a cornerstone of the electromagnetic duality, the other one is the
poincare lemma. it denes the necessary and sucient condition for the existence of solutions in the
eld equations. the solution to the general symmetrical maxwell equations must be fragmented on
integrable pieces, that can be based on the class em1 with dx = 0, because this is the key condition
for the integrability.

3

is the electromagnetic eld dened by the maxwell equa-
tions?

usually it can be asserted that the electromagnetic eld is the one that veries the maxwell, or maxwell-
like, equations. reciprocally if a eld veries the maxwell equations, then it is considered as the elec-
tromagnetic eld. a goal of this paper is to prove that maxwell-like equations are general and abstract
equations without any semantic meaning related to a specic eld. any second rank tensor x can be

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

8

expressed as: xab = x(ab) +x[ab]. if the usual assertion is right, then x[ab]  em0 is an electromagnetic-
like eld because it veries the maxwell equations, has two associated currents and a stress-energy tensor.
consequently, many electromagnetic-like elds are mathematically possible, however not all of these for-
mal elds have any physical meaning.

the class em0 can be considered as an abstract and formal representation of a dual electromagnetic-
like eld. due to the existence of magnetic monopoles is an hypothesis, any theoretical approach to this
concept must be based on some axiomatic. the only condition imposed in this paper is that the eld
can be represented by a skew-symmetrical second rank tensor. due to this condition is very general, it
is expected that the conclusions will be widely validated.

the electromagnetic eld can be formally represented by a second rank skew-symmetric tensor f 
em0. based on theorems 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, this tensor has some associated tensors: an -current, j, a
-current, j, and a stress-energy tensor t. they verify that:

  f = 4 j
 f = 4 j
f bc)

(facf bc + fac

t b

a =

1
8

 j = 0
 j = 0
  t = j  f + j f

(45)
(46)

(47)

these equations are duality invariant, specically the expression of the stress-energy tensor match
with a general invariant form[27]. one of both the -current or the -current is an electric current and
the other one is a monopolar magnetic current. both choice are valid because provide the same formal
symmetry to maxwell equations. in this paper, j and j are considered respectively as the electric and
the magnetic monopolar currents. the  and  names will appear along the paper because are useful
to reveal the duality symmetry.

a dierence appears when this formal derivation is compared with the classical electromagnetic eld.
instead of a potential vector, a, two potential vectors, a and a, must be considered based on the
theorem 2.2. also two auxiliary elds f and f  em1 are introduced. they verify that:

f = f  
f

fab = a ab  b aa
fab = a ab  b aa

each potential vector is related independently with its current type as:

 (cid:3) aa + rb
(cid:3) aa + rb

a ab = ja
a ab = ja

(48)
(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

in an electromagnetic duality hypothesis, two independent currents must be considered: the magnetic
and the electric eld sources. two approaches can be considered for mapping these sources in an
electromagnetic eld. in this paper as zwanziger[28] two vector elds are considered, this preserves the
radial vs axial properties of elds. the magnetic eld generated by a magnetic charge is of radial type
based on the gradient of a scalar, while the magnetic eld generated by a electric charge is of axial
type based on a curl. so, in a full electromagnetic duality two radial and two axial eld are involved.
however most works in electromagnetic duality t the dual sources into a single vector eld. this is not
an obvious task which need of some heuristic as the dirac string monopole.

the existence of magnetic monopoles is an hypothesis that extended the symmetry of maxwell
equations towards the symmetry of charges[29]. the eld generated by a singular electric charge is well
mapped into a vector potential. while that, if the eld generates by a magnetic monopole is mapped
in the same vector potential, the expected symmetry is broken. it appears two dierent concepts: the
point singular electric charge and the string singular magnetic monopole. the dirac quantization arises
as a condition imposed to avoid the physical eect of the string[29, 13], i.e., it is a property of the formal
model of magnetic monopole, not of the magnetic charge itself.

this paper deals with -charges or magnetic charges rather than dirac magnetic monopoles. if a full
symmetrical duality is desired, the topological counterpart of a point singular electric charge must be
other one. this is called a magnetic charge. based on the theorem 2.2 a simple and symmetrical solution

is found by using two potential vectors. this approach has some advantages because a switch between
the elds f  f is reduced, as shown equation (48), to a switch between the two auxiliary elds:
f  f and f   f, which is more similar to the current switch: j  j and j   j as
it is deduced from equations (45) and (46).

4 duality invariance

duality invariance is related to how eld properties are modied with the transposition: f  f. some
equation changes are expected with this transposition. invariant equations are preferred because it is
supposed that both representations, f and f are equivalents. the main principle involved in duality
invariance is that both descriptions have the same information, thus both descriptions must be valid
representations of the involved physical fact. non privileged reference system can be found in general
relativity to study the physical laws, consequently all reference system are equivalent for this propose.
by analogy, any symbol which have the same information should be equivalent to study the physical
laws.

instead of invariance in a discrete transposition as f  f, it is required a continuous invariance
related with a rotation phase, , between the two elds. a complex tensor can be introduced to deal
with this rotations: f + f. in this case a rotation generates a complex tensor: e(f + f). duality
invariance must be considered as mathematical invariance to rotations. as well as in general relativity
the covariant representation is introduced to be independent of any coordinate systems, a representation
invariant to phase  must be introduced. alternatively to the representation in the complex plane, a
continuous transformation is introduced as:

f = f cos  + f sin 

(53)

by taking its dual: f = f cos   f sin , it is obtained a representation based on a rotation

matrix, r(), similar that the one used by deser et al.[8, 20]:

f (cid:19)
(cid:18) f

= r()(cid:18) f
f (cid:19)

r() =(cid:18) cos 

 sin  cos  (cid:19)

sin 

(54)

a duality plane, d = 2, is introduced in addition to the riemannian space-time with d = 4.
according with the section 2.3, this approach clearly evidences the connection between the duality
problem and the rotation invariance, in this case with the so(2) group. the tensors having two parts,
e.g.  and , can be represented by extended tensors with pre-index:

uli...
a...

um i...
a...

u = 0, 1 a, ..., i, ... = 0, 1, 2, 3

(55)

any extended tensor, ula

b , can be expressed symbolically in short as: ul, la

b and also as l, by
abstracting some or all the index types. the covariant and contravariant pre-index are related with
the symmetrical group while the ordinary index are related with the space-time. instead of mix both
index classes using dierent letter types, each dierent semantic index is represented in dierent places.
e.g. the electromagnetic eld tensors, which have a dual interpretation, are represented by the extended
tensors: ufab, uaa and uja, such as:

0f = f
1f = f

0a = a
1a = a

0j = j
1j = j

it is veried that:

thus, it is obtained that:

(cid:18) f
f (cid:19) = 4(cid:18) j
j (cid:19)
j (cid:19)
(cid:18) j
= r()(cid:18) j
j (cid:19)

transformed as follows:

the concept of rotation in the em0 class is extended to all  and  related tensors, so they are
(60)

i...
a... = r()li...

a...

l

in the duality plane are considered the symmetrical identity tensor, ab, and the skew-symmetrical

tensor, ab. they are represented as:

 =(cid:18) 1

0

0

1 (cid:19)

1

 =(cid:18) 0

1 0 (cid:19)

(61)

if t is the transpose of , it is veried that: t  = , it is equivalent to: uv uw = v

w, and
also:  = . the metric tensor allows the use of covariant and contravariant components related
to: vai...
a.... two operators are introduced in the duality plane. the following expression
are called the scalar and the vectorial products in the duality plane, which are operators based on the
previous matrices:

a... = (vu) uai...

(ai...

a...)

(ai...

a...)

d

 (bj...
 (bj...

d

b...) = (uv)( vai...
b...) = (uv) (vai...

a...)( ubj...
b...)
a...) (ubj...
b...)

(62)

(63)

these bilinear expressions are duality invariant because if rt is the transpose of the rotation matrix,

it is veried that:

rt ()r() = 

rt ()r() = 

(64)

any matrix, , which generates a invariant operator must verify: rt ()r() = , but any solution
of this equation can be expressed as a linear combination of the previous:  = a + b, where a and b
are constant. this is due to:

r() =  cos  +  sin 

rt () =  cos    sin 

(65)

therefore, any bilinear invariant in the duality plane can be constructed from the dened scalar and
vectorial operators. the scalar and vectorial products are symmetric and skew-symmetric respectively.
both are linear operators, symbolically expressed as:

l

 (cm + dn) = c(l
 (cm + dn) = c(l

 m) + d(l

d

 n)
 n)

d

(66)

(67)

where (c, d) are ordinary tensors, which are constant for the duality plane operators.

4.1 the invariant electromagnetical tensors

extended tensors allows to express the electromagnetic equations by using more compact and invariant
expressions. a dependence form is dened to clarify the relation between tensors. the forward chain:
a  b means that tensor b can be computed from tensor a. the electromagnetic chain is a forward
chain including the related eld tensors, it is presented as:

j  a  k  f  t

(68)

the currents are the eld sources, they can be considered as the basic data of this forward dependence.
a backward interpretation of this chain can be also used in some cases. the k eld is introduced to
deal more easily with the rst derivative of the potential vector. the j  a dependence is represented
by dening the tensor relation:
(69)

uab = 4 uj a

a

 (cid:3) uaa + rb

the a  k dependence is as follows:

uk ab = a

uab  b

uaa

(70)

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

11

the k  f dependence is related with the theorem 2.2, it is expressed using extended tensors as:
(71)

uf = uk  (uv) (

vk)

it is possible to express the maxwell equations and the current conservation law in a compact and

invariant form as:

(72)
finally, the f  t dependence is concerning with the stress-energy tensor, it can be expressed in

  uf = 4 uj

  uj = 0

duality invariant form as:

t b

a =

1
8

(fac

d

 fbc)

  t = f = j

d

 f

(73)

where f is the force density produced by the eld-current interaction. when a duality plane rotation
is produced with  = /2, a permutation between the electric and magnetic eld is veried in the eld
f, but this rotation does a permutation between  and  parts in the extended tensors: j, a and k. in
some aspects the tensors f and f are a bit redundant, due to uf = uv vf. these can be obtained
from the tensor k  em1, which veries the following maxwell equations:

 uk = 4 uj

 uk = 0

(74)

the eld k can be considered as a simplied or soft version of the general eld f. some advantages
can be achieved by using the soft eld, most of them are related with a term splitting in some equations.
some time, these terms are related with specic physical meaning. based on proposition 10, the stress-
energy tensor can be expressed as: t = ()t + ()t + ()t. the two rst terms can be merged in a
more compact representation called the parallel stress-energy tensor: (+)t:

(+)t b

a = ()t b

a + ()t b

a =

1
8

(kac

which veries:

 (+)t = j

d

 k

(75)

(76)

d

where j

 k = 0j  0k + 1j  1k is the parallel force density. the electrical current is interacting
with the electrical generated eld and reciprocally for the magnetic current. this case is composed of
two independent and separable electromagnetic-like elds. each eld is produced by its own current,
which is neutral to the action of the other eld. the term ()t is called the perpendicular stress-energy
tensor. based on the proposition 10, it can be expressed as:

()t b

a = 

1
8

(kac

d

 kbc + kbc

d

 kac) =

it veries that:

  ()t = j

d

 k

(77)

(78)

d

where j

 k = 0j  1 k  1j  0 k is the perpendicular force density. in this case the electric
current is interacting with the magnetic generated eld, being neutral to the electrical generated eld,
and reciprocally for the magnetic current.

5 lagrange function invariance

a complete electromagnetic theory must include a model of the lagrange action function. the action
based approach of modern physic become de facto the way to put altogether the interaction elds. also
this approach is useful to deal with dierent invariance types. an invariant action must be proposed to
solve the variational problem i = 0, where:

i =z gl(a, f)d4x

(79)

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

12

in classical theory the lagrange function l is proportional to fabf ab, however this function is not
 fab is null. the lagrange func-
duality invariant. unfortunately an equivalent invariant function: fab
tion must verify three imposed restrictions. firstly it must be duality invariant. the second restriction
is that the maxwell equations must be obtained with variations of the potential vector a. finally,
the function must provide the correct expression of the stress-energy tensor with the metric variations
gab. a lot of works are recently concerning with the construction of a lagrange function verifying these
restrictions [18, 30, 21, 20].

d

similar to zwanziger[28], in the approach of this paper two elds are considered, therefore the function
must be expressed as: l(ua, uf). to deal more easily with the rst derivative of the potential vector,
the soft eld is included: l(ua, uk). the lagrange function related with the eld is composed of
two terms, the rst is related with the electromagnetic eld itself, and the second is related with the
current-eld interaction:

l = lf (uk) + lc(uj, ua)

(80)

in order to generate the maxwell equations, the interaction term is based on the expression: ja

 aa.
the eld part can be constructed by using bilinear invariant expressions formed with the tensors k and
k. however all the vectorial bilinear expressions constructed with these tensors are null.

5.1 the perpendicular interaction

the perpendicular interaction between current and eld become through the perpendicular stress-energy
tensor dened in the equation (77). however, this tensor has some diculties to be easily integrated in
the lagrangian viewpoint of physical theories. according with this approach, any physical interaction
must be reected in a well formed term of the lagrange function. a well formed term is related with
dependence on the eld variables and its rst order derivatives, and also by removing the dummy
terms. to illustrate the diculties related with the perpendicular stress-energy tensor, rstly it must be
simplied by erasing the dummy terms. if sab is obtained from a dummy term in the lagrange function
l(dum) as:

sab(l(dum)) = 2

l(dum)
gab + gabl(dum)

(84)

the eective value of the stress-energy tensor is: t(ef f )ab = tab  sab(l(dum)). by applying this

process to the perpendicular stress-energy tensor, it arises the following theorem:

theorem 5.1 (perpendicular-less). the perpendicular stress-energy tensor has a null eective value,
()t(ef f ) = 0 generated by a null dummy function l(dum) = 0.

proof. if l(dum) is expressed as:

l(dum) =

based on the proposition 7 it is veried that: kbc

l(dum)
gab =

[gdvkad  kbv]

(86)

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

therefore, it is obtained that:

sab =

kac

d

 kb

c + gabl(dum)

t(ef f )ab = gabl(dum)

however, based on the proposition 7 it is veried that l(dum) = 0.

13

(87)

remark 4. the perpendicular stress-energy tensor is obtained from a null lagrange term. if an interac-
tion has a physical meaning it can not be vanish by means of a mathematical transformation of this type.
thus the perpendicular interaction must be considered as a physical meaning-less concept, consequently
it must be removed in the equations.

5.2 the parallel interaction

d

the term kab
parallel stress-energy tensor. the lagrange function of this interaction is expressed as:

 kab is non-null, duality invariant, generates the maxwell equations and provides the

which provide the maxwell equations: 4 uj a = b

l

uk ab. based on equations (71) and (74), it is

veried that:

b (uf ab) = b (uk ab)  (uv)b(vk ab) = b (uk ab) = 4 uj a

(90)

according to einstein general relativity, the stress-energy tensor can be obtained from the eld action

as:

it is obtained the next result:

tab = 2

lf
gab + gablf

t b

(91)

(92)

based on the proposition 7, it can be expressed as in the equation (75). by using the einstein
equation, g = 8t, this expression of the stress-energy tensor allows to obtain the metric and eld
associated to a charged central body as a black hole. in the outer space of the body, the soft eld can
be expressed as: uk ab = uqkab, where q is the body charge, and kab is the solution for an unitary
charge. the stress-energy tensor is based on the scalar product, being multiplied by (q)2 = q
 q,
where q is the equivalent combined charge. the reissner-nordstron metric[4, 15] arises as the solution
for this problem based on the mass m and the combined charge: (q)2. it is concluded that from the
viewpoint of the electromagnetic duality presented in this paper, the metric of an electric or magnetic
charged black hole are identical formally but dierent numerically.

6 particle-field interaction

from an operational viewpoint, a eld is a formal representation of a physical fact which determines
an interaction with some type of particle. a trajectory xa(s) is associated to a virtual particle. if non
quantum theory is considered, the trajectory is the formal representation of the virtual particle. a
vector eld p tangent to the trajectory is considered. if the particle is massive, p = kpk 6= 0, then the
trajectory has a unitary tangent vector u.

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

14

theorem 6.1 (lorentz-like). the vector eld p with non-null and constant p = kpk veries the next
equation along any of its eld lines:

dpa
ds

= f a = pa

bub

where pab  em1 can be expressed as: pab = 2[bpa].

proof. the absolute derivation of a eld line can be expressed as follows:

dp
ds

=

dpa
ds

ea = (bpa)ubea

(93)

(94)

due to papa is constant, it can be obtained the next expression: (bpa)ub = 2[bpa]ub.
the vector f , which veries: f  u = 0, is acting as a force according to newton second law in general
relativity. this force excludes the gravitational one embedded in the geometry itself. if it is veried that
f = 0, then the trajectories are geodesic expressed as: (dpk/ds) = 0, otherwise an interaction of the
particle with some eld must be supposed. to provide a mathematical model of this interaction some
type of coupling constant must be introduced as a particle parameter[24]. this constant is related to
how the trajectory is modied by the eld. the coupling constant is considered the charge of the virtual
particle, in this case two charge types must be considered. if the tensor nab is representing the particle-
eld interaction as: pabub = nabub, then to have any solution to the particle trajectory the determinant
|pab  nab| must be null. the simplest solution of this condition is that: pab = nab. the particle charge
is represented by a constant vector in the duality plane[31]: q  (q, q). it is transformed by a rotation
as[27]: q = r()q, thus when a phase rotation with  = /2 is performed, the charge is changed from
(q, q) to (q, q).

the term j

term qua can be considered as the particle current, and the expression: (q

 f is the force density in a continuous case. by analogy, for a virtual particle, the
 f)  u, as the force of the
 f)ab, thus the next equation must

eld-particle interaction. in this case it is veried that: nab = (q
be considered by applying the splitting theorem:

d

d

d

a formal similarity can be found by comparing the force produced in the discrete case of particle-eld

interaction, with the continuous case of current-eld interaction:

pab = q

d

 kab  q

d

 kab

(95)

d

fa = (qub)

fa = (jb)

 kab  (qub)
 kab  (jb)

d

 kab

d

 kab

(96)

(97)

in both cases the force is composed of two parts: the parallel and the perpendicular. the equation

(95) can be transformed as:

[b(p + q

d

 a)a] =  (q  kab)

(98)

d

remark 5. this equation is un-homogeneous because the lhs is in em1 and the rhs is in em2. based
on the proposition 11, there are not general solution for this equation. a particular solution is possible
if q
 j = 0, i.e., the test particle must be non-perpendicular
to the current. thus, a serious restriction is imposed for the existence of a particle trajectory in the
perpendicular interaction.

 kab  em3. this implies that: q

d

however the perpendicular force is associated to a null stress-energy tensor. it must be excluded of
the equations because there are not energy associated with this interaction. the force must be expressed
as:

fa = (qub)

d

 kab

fa = (jb)

d

 kab

(99)

axiomatic electromagnetical duality

15

thus, the equation (98) is transformed as: [b(p + q

solved by means of a scalar gradient as:

d

 a)a] = 0. this equation can be immediately

pa = as  q

d

 aa

(100)

the scalar s is representing the action of the particle trajectory. this approach fulls with the
hamilton-jacobi formulation of classical mechanic. instead of solving the dierential equation of theo-
rem 6.1, the trajectory can be obtained by solving the next dierential equation on s:

(as  q

d

 aa)(as  q

d

 aa) = (p)2

(101)

remark 6. the perpendicular interaction is hardly integrated in both well proved theoretical approaches:
the lagrangian of continuous elds and the hamilton-jacobi of particle dynamic. also, the approach of
this paper is not inconsistent with the results of the ahoronov-bohm experiment[32]. in a quasi-classical
limit of quantum theory, the particle wave function is: (xa)  exp[s(xa)/], in this case the phase
dierence in the wave function[23] is related to the factor:

c =ic

(q

d

 aa)dxa

(102)

for any electromagnetic eld generated by electron based technologies as in all the electrical an

electronic devices and instruments, it must be: aa = (1, 0)aa, thus: q

d

 aa = qeaa.

6.1 particle-particle interaction

some results concerning with particle-particle interaction can be obtained from the previous equations.
two dierent particles are considered, one is acting as the eld source, its eld tensors are proportional
to its charge q. the other particle is acting as a singular test particle with charge q. if the electric
and magnetic charges are supposed basic values multiplied by integer numbers, the basic electric and
magnetic values are e and  respectively1. for a particle pair, the scalar and the vectorial product of
the charges are two interaction constants similar to the charge product in classical electrodynamic:

q

d

 q = (e)n

q

d

 q = (e)2m + ()2k

n, m, k = 0,1,2, . . .

(103)

the vectorial product, expressed as: q

 q = 0q 1q 1q 0q, is not included in the dynamic equations
due to it is related with the un-energetic perpendicular interaction. this expression in the classical
theory is equivalent to the corresponding in the quantum theory known as the zwanziger-schwinger
charge quantization[5, 31, 33, 34] which is an extension of the dirac quantization. the dynamic of the
test particle is formulate by means of the hamilton-jacobi equation resulting from the expression

d

pa = as  (q

d

 q)aa

(104)

where a is the potential associated with a unitary charge. the scalar and vectorial product of
particle charges are two constants which dene most of the dynamic properties in the particle-particle
interaction. two special particle families can be considered based on these charge products.

(1) parallel particles, having q

 q = 0. in this case the electric part of the charge is active to the
electric part of the potential vector and neutral to the magnetic part, and similar result for the magnetic
part of the charge. this particle pair are interacting by means of two independent electromagnetic-like
elds.

d

(2) perpendicular particles, having q

 q = 0. in this case the particles do not interact by means
of the electromagnetic interaction, each particle is neutral to the other, however, they are not neutral
particles.

d

a simple case can be considered to illustrate these results. let be a particle set where both the 
and  charges are always the basic values multiplied by: [+1, 0,1]. nine particle types, {0, . . . , 8},
are obtained as shown in the figure 2. the identical particles are always parallel particles, thus two
independent electric-to-electric and magnetic-to-magnetic interactions are veried.

the particle pair (1, 5), is composed of two pure electrical particles, its interaction is identical to
the determined by the classical electrodynamics. the pair (3, 7) is composed of two pure magnetic
monopoles, its interaction is similar to the previous pair, but there are an interchange between the 
and  elds. the pair (1, 3) is composed of a pure electric and a pure magnetic monopole, its
interaction is null. this can be considered a paradox resulting from the axiomatic exposed in this paper.
the interaction associated with this model of electromagnetic duality appears to be related with two
independent electromagnetic-like eld, and consequently with the generation and interaction with two
independent electromagnetic-like waves. the particle-particle interaction exposed in this paper is similar
to the classical electrodynamic, but the arithmetic product of charges is substituted by the charge scalar
product, or charge projection. the interaction in the pair (1, 2) is in the magnitude of (e)2, while the
interaction in the pair (2, 3) is in ()2. the equations are symmetric between the  and  concepts,
but the numeric values can be dierent.

in the non-relativistic limit the interaction between two particles with charges q and q, spatially

sited at r and r can be represented by the three dimensional force verifying a coulomb-like law as:

f = (q

d

 q)

(r  r)
|r  r|3

(105)

where the scalar product of charges replaces the arithmetic one. the scalar product can be expressed
as: |q||q| cos qq , were qq is the relative angle between the charge vectors q and q. for qq > /2
the interaction becomes of attractive type, while if qq < /2 it is of repulsive type. e.g. in a system
with three charges as:

q(0) = (

1
3

e, 0)

q(1) = (

2
3

e, q)

q(2) = (

2
3

e,q)

(106)

it is veried that: q(0) + q(1) + q(2) = (e, 0). the three charges are mutually attractive if: q > (2/3)e,
so they can form a stable system.

7 conclusions

a theory of electromagnetic duality has been presented. it has been developed in the framework of the
classical theory of eld, based on the einstein general relativity. the proposed theory carries out the
symmetry of maxwell equations, the invariance of the stress-energy tensor, and also the invariance of
the lagrange action. the theory has been developed using an axiomatic method to deduce the maxwell
equations. the main result is that many electromagnetic-like elds can be considered in physical theories,
because the maxwell equations, which dene this quality, are general and abstract equations rather than
specically related with any specic eld. two potential vectors are needed to deal with both source
types. this provides some dierent eld behaviour when is compared with the classical theory.

the stress-energy tensor is composed of two parts: the parallel and the perpendicular. in the parallel
part each current type is interacting with the eld of the same type. in the perpendicular part, the
interaction become between currents and elds of dierent types. the eective value of the perpendicular
part of the stress-energy tensor is null, thus the interaction between current and eld is carries out
by means of the parallel force involving two independent electromagnetic-like elds. also two non-
interacting electromagnetic-like waves can be generated. this paradigm of magnetic monopole is very
dierent from the usual concept. an important conclusion is obtained in this paper, the electromagnetic
duality related with the symmetrical maxwell equations do not imply the existence of the usual concept
of magnetic monopoles, because other paradigms can be considered.

in the usual concept of magnetic monopole, the magnetic eld generated by a magnetic monopole
and the magnetic eld generated by a moving electric charge are the same eld. a similar hypothesis
is assumed for the electric elds. however, in the einstein general relativity the maxwell equations
can be taken symmetrically, but a new concept arises which is the magnetic monopole neutral to the
electromagnetic eld generated by the electric charges and vice versa. for a correct use of the concepts,
the  eld and charge will be used instead of the magnetic term, because this must only be applied to
the axial eld of the electrical charges.

two electromagnetic-like waves must be considered, the -waves and the -waves. these waves
can interact with particles, but each of these waves types must be distinguish. there are not any
mathematical dierences between both types.
if there are any real dierences between the  and 
elds, they are transmitted by their respective waves, and the remote particles can be selective to each
wave type. if the introduction of two types of currents and elds is only a mathematical convection, the
waves can be indistinguishable far from their sources. if these dierences are at a semantic level rather
than at a formal level, then as the mass or the charge, the  and  concepts are physical properties. the
-eld and its charges can be assimilated to the electromagnetic eld and its electric charges, so it is
necessary to nd a candidate for the -eld and its charges. additionally to the -photon, a counterpart
the -photon will be considered, this particle must be mass-less or with very little mass. this particle
must also be low interacting with the electric charges. the counterpart of the electron, which is the
basic  particle, must be, formally a similar particle, but neutral from the electric charges. if the so
called -photon and -electron exist, they must be very evasive particles, as the neutrino.
