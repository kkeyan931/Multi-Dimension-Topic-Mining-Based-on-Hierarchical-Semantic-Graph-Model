abstract

we present a new point of view on the quantization of the gravitational eld, namely
we use exclusively the quantum framework of the second quantization. more explicitly,
we take as one-particle hilbert space, hgraviton the unitary irreducible representation
of the poincare group corresponding to a massless particle of helicity 2 and apply the
second quantization procedure with einstein-bose statistics. the resulting hilbert space
f +(hgraviton) is, by denition, the hilbert space of the gravitational eld. then we prove
that this hilbert space is canonically isomorphic to a space of the type ker(q)/im(q)
where q is a supercharge dened in an extension of the hilbert space f +(hgraviton) by
the inclusion of ghosts: some fermion ghosts u, u which are vector elds and a bosonic
ghost  which is a scalar eld. this has to be contrasted to the usual approaches where
only the fermion ghosts are considered. however, a rigorous proof that this is, indeed,
possible seems to be laking from the literature.

1 introduction

one possible way to perform the quantization of the gravitational eld is to liniarize the classical
theory of gravitation using the so called goldberg variables [9], [12] and then to apply some
sort of canonical quantization of the resulting eld theory. because of the gauge invariance of
the theory (which in this case is the invariance under general coordinates transformations) one
obtains a constrained system and one tries to use a bleuler-gupta type formalism, thats it
to start with an hilbert space endowed with a sesquilinear non-degenerate form and select the
physical states as a subspace of the type qa = 0, a = 1, . . . , n.

among the pioneering works in this approach we mention [26], [7], [19], [13], [17], [18]. using
the result of this analysis many computations have been done in the literature (see [3], [14], [4],
[29], [28]).

a related idea is to extend the fock space to an auxiliary hilbert space hgh including
some ctious elds, called ghosts, and construct a supercharge (i.e. an operator q verifying
q2 = 0) such that the physical hilbert space is hphys  ker (q)/im(q) (see for instance [18]
and references quoted there). as a result of this procedure, it is asserted that the graviton, i.e.
the elementary quantum particle must be a massless spin 2 particle. the construction of the
supercharge relies heavily on classical eld theory arguments, because one tries to obtain for
the quantum gauge transformations expressions of the same type as the general coordinates
transformations appearing in general relativity. this invariance is then promoted to a brst
invariance which should be implemented by the supercommutator with the supercharge.

we will present in this paper a careful analysis of this construction establishing the equiv-
alence of hilbert spaces from above in a rigorous way.
in our opinion, this sort of analysis
seems to be laking form the literature. in establishing this result we will use a pure quantum
point of view, as advocated in [25]. to be completely rigorous, we dene the graviton to be
the unitary irreducible representation of the poincare group corresponding to zero mass and
helicity 2 [27]. the usual wigner representation for this elementary system is not very good for
practical purposes. to have some analogy with the situation from the classical eld theoretical
description of gravity one has to nd out an analogue of the construction of the photon by some
factorization procedure, more precisely to implement a construction of the same type as that of
[27] ch. iv.7 (see also [24], [16], [10]). the explicit construction is not so elementary as in the
case of the photon and deserves a detailed presentation. one will construct the hilbert space of
the graviton as a factor space hgraviton  h/h where h  h  h for some auxiliary hilbert
space h, as in the case of the photon, but the construction of these hilbert spaces is rather
complicated as it also is the verication that this factor space carries the desired representation
of the poincare group. this is done in the next section.

next, we apply the standard second quantization procedures [2], [1], [16], [27] to hgraviton,
thats it we postulate that the many-gravitons system is the bosonic fock space associated to
this one-particle hilbert space: fgraviton  f +(hgraviton). like in the case of the photon, one
can prove that this hilbert space can also be written as a factor space fgraviton  h/h where
h  h  h for some auxiliary hilbert space h. this is done in section 3 and 4.
next, we prove that one can extend the hilbert space h by including some ghosts: namely,
a pair of fermion ghosts u, u which are vector elds and a bosonic ghosts  which is a scalar

1

eld such that we construct a supercharge q in the extended hilbert space hgh and prove that
fgraviton  ker(q)/im(q). this is done in section 5.
finally, in section 6, we give the expression for the brst transformation and analyse the
concept of observables in this framework.

the vulnerability of this type of approach to the construction of free elds is the fact that,
although the playground of the construction, which is the fock space, is a canonical object,
being canonically constructed from the one-particle hilbert space, the expressions of the free
elds are deeply dependent on the representation adopted for this one-particle space. distinct
factorization procedures (if they do exist) might lead to distinct theories. it is suggested in the
literature [21], [22] that a road out of this problem is to use ideas from algebraic eld theory.
we stress here that in the usual approaches only the fermion ghosts are considered. how-
ever, a rigorous proof that the equality fgraviton  ker(q)/im(q) is true seems to be laking
from the literature. we will present at the end of section 4 some arguments which raises doubts
about the correctness of the standard procedures.

we also mention that a rigorous construction of the hilbert space of the many-gravitons
system is indispensable for the construction of the corresponding s-matrix in the sense of
perturbation theory of bogoliubov. this construction emphasize the basic role of causality in
quantum eld theory (see also [21], [22] where it is remarked that causality is again the major
physical axiom in algebraic eld theory). the recursive construction of epstein and glaser [6],
[8] as presented in [23], [11] and [25] makes sense only if this starting point is settled, because
otherwise it is not clear if the elementary physical particle of the theory is characterized by zero
mass and helicity 2 as should be the case for the graviton. we will reconsider the construction of
a consistent theory of quantum gravity, in the sense of perturbation theory, using the formalism
developed here in another publication.

2 the graviton as an elementary relativistic

free particles

as we have anticipated in the introduction, one denes the graviton as a certain unitary
irreducible representation of the poincare group corresponding to zero mass and helicity 2. we
will describe this representation using the formalism of hilbert space bundles, as presented in
[27], ch. vi.7 thm 6.20.

first, we x some notations. the upper hyperboloid of mass m  0 is by denition x +
m 
m(p)  dp
{p  r4| kpk2 = m2}; it is a borel set with to the lorentz invariant measure d+
2(p) .
here the conventions are the following: k  k is the minkowski norm dened by kpk2  p  p
and p  q is the minkowski bilinear form: p  q  p0q0  p  q. if p  r3 we dene  (p)  x +
according to  (p)  ((p), p), (p)  pp2 + m2.
we start now to dene the graviton, as a representation of zero mass and helicity 2 of the

m

poincare group.

proposition 2.1 let us dene by f the space of complex traceless symmetric 4  4 matrices:
(2.1)

f  {h|h = h,

h

 = 0}.

then, we dene the following objects:
(a) the borel set:

p = 0}.
h
(b) the canonical projection on the rst entry:  : b  x +
0 ;
(c) the action of the group sl(2, c) on b:

b  {(p, h)|p  x +
0 ,

h  f,

where  : sl(2, c)  l

(d) the sesquilinear forms

d(a)  (p, h)  ((a)
+ is the standard group homomorphism;

p, (a)

(a)

h)

(2.2)

(2.3)

((p, h), (p, h))p  hh
.

(we use the convention of summation over the dummy indices.)

then (x +

0 , b, sl(2, c), ) is a pre-hilbert space bundle.

proof: one can easily verify that this assertion is correct:
(i) the operators d(a) are well dene and they give an borel action of the group sl(2, c)

on b.

(ii) the bre b(p)  1({p}) is a vector subspace of f (of dimension 5).
(iii) the operators d(a) map b(p) into b((a)  p) and leave invariant the sesquilinear

forms in the sense:

(d(a)  (p, h), d(a)  (p, h))p = ((p, h), (p, h))(a)p.

3

(iv) we still have to prove that the sesquilinear forms are positively dened. for this we
use (iii) and the fact that there exists an element a  sl(2, c) such that p  (a) p is of the
form p  = (1, 0, 0, 1). let the transformed matrix be

h  (a)

(a)

h.

one has to write explicitly all the constraints on the matrix h, namely the symmetry, the
tracelessness and the property the gives zero when applied to the quadri-vector p . after some
elementary computations one discovers that the generic form of the matrix h is:

h00 = h33 = 2f0, h03 = h30 = 2f0,
h10 = h01 = f1, h20 = h02 = f2,
h13 = h31 = f1, h23 = h32 = f2,
h11 = h22 = , h12 = h21 = ;

(2.4)

here the (complex) numbers f,  = 0, . . . , 3 and ,
elementary h h = 2(2 + 2)  0 which proves the positive deniteness. (cid:4)
mine in the next proposition the elements of zero norm.

we can easily see that the sesquilinear forms are not strictly positively dened. we deter-

 are arbitrary. we have now quite

proposition 2.2 let (p, h)  b; then ((p, h), (p, h))p = 0 if and only if the matrix h is of the
form

h(p) = pf(p) + pf(p)

where the quadri-vector function f is constrained by the transversality condition:

pf(p) = 0.

(2.5)

proof: we use the expression p and h dened in the preceding proposition. if we have
((p, h), (p, h))p = 0 i.e. hh = 0 then we also have h h = 0. if we use the relations (2.4)
then we obtain  =  = 0 and it easily follows that one can write the relations (2.4) in the
compact form

moreover, we also have

if we dene

h = pf + pf.

p f = 0.

f  (a1)
then we get the two relations from the statement. (cid:4)

f

now we are ready to use the formalism of hilbert space bundles.

4

proposition 2.3 let us dene

f0  {(p, h)  f|hh = 0},

[f]  f/f0.

we construct the following object:
(a) the borel set:

[b]  {(p, [h])|p  x +
0 ,

p = 0,
(b) the canonical projection on the rst entry: [] : [b]  x +
0 ;
(c) the action of the group sl(2, c) on [b]:

[h]  [f],

h

h  [h]}.

[d(a)]  (p, [h])  ((a)  p, [(a)2  h])

where we use for simplicity tensor notations (without indices).

(d) the sesquilinear forms

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

((p, [h]), (p, [h]))p  hh
,

h  [h],

h  [h].

then (x +

0 , [b], sl(2, c), []) is a hilbert space bundle with bres of dimension 2.

the proof is elementary: one simply has to check that all objects are well dened i.e.

independent of the choice of the representatives in the equivalence classes [].
let us denote the bre over p by [b](p). then we apply the standard construction from [27]
vi.8 of associating to the hilbert space bundle [b] a representation of the group insl(2, c)
(which is the universal covering group of the proper orthochronous poincare group).

theorem 2.4 let us construct the vector space

s(p)  [b](p)}
(i.e. the space of borel sections of the hilbert space bundle [b]) and dene

is a borel function,

0  [f ]|s

v = {s : x +

ksk2  zx +

0

d+

0 (p)

((p, s(p)), (p, s(p)))p .

we dene now the space

then v  is a pre-hilbert space with respect to the scalar product

v   {s  v| ksk2 < };

(s, s)  zx +

0

d+

0 (p)

((p, s(p)), (p, s(p)))p .

let v  be the hilbert space which is the completion of v  with respect to the scalar product (,)
and let us dene the operators ua,a : v   v  by

(ua,as) (p)  eiap[(a)  h((a1)  p)],

for

(a, a)  insl(2, c)

(2.9)

where h(p)  s(p). then u is a unitary representation of insl(2, c) and it is equivalent to the
representation u +,4  u +,4 (see [27] thm 9.4).
5

proof: we want to apply the theorem 6.20 from [27]. so, we must determine the action of
the stability subgroup e on the bre [b](1, 0, 0, 1). we remind that the group e is formed
from elements of sl(2, c) of the following type:

a = (cid:18) z

0

z1a

z1 (cid:19) ,

z, a  c,

|z| = 1.

(2.10)

we also note that the bre [b](1, 0, 0, 1) can be identied as the quotient space of the space
of all matrices of the form (2.4) factorized to the space v of the matrices constrained by the
condition  =  = 0. it follows that we can identify [b](1, 0, 0, 1) with the space of matrices
h, of the form

(h,)11 = (h,)22 = ,

so, we have the isomorphism

(h,)12 = (h,)21 = ,

(h,) = 0,

in rest.

(2.11)

[b](1, 0, 0, 1)  [h,]  (, )  c2.

we have to compute the action of the group e on such elements so we have to compute

the matrix

(h 

,) = (a)

(a)

(h).

this matrix should be of the form h (mod(v )) and one nds out that we have

 = {[(a)1
1(a)2

 = [(a)1

1]2  [(a)1
1  (a)1

2]2} + 2(a)1
2] + [(a)1

1(a)1
1(a)2

2(a)2

2 = (z4) + (z4),
2 + (a)1
1] =
(z4) + (z4).

2(a)2

(2.12)

in the new variables

we have the transformation rules

u   + i,

v =   i

u = z4u,

v = z4v

i.e. we have the representation 4  4 of the stability subgroup e. the assertion from the
statement follows now from thm. 6.20 of [27]. (cid:4)
we note that the couple ( v , u) is a unitary representation of the group insl(2, c) which
corresponds to zero mass and helicity 2. according to the usual physical interpretation, we
call this system graviton. we remark that this (true) representation of the group insl(2, c)
induces a true representation of the group p  as it this the case with all representations of
integer spin (or helicity). moreover, this representation can be extended to the whole poincare
group. it is possible to express this representation in an analogous way to the photon if one
0 , f, d+
considers a factorisation procedure [27]. let us consider the hilbert space h  l2(x +
0 )
with the scalar product

< ,  > zx +

0

d+

0 (p) < (p), (p) >f

(2.13)

6

where

< ,  >f

3

x,=0



is the usual scalar product in f.

in this hilbert space we have the following (non-unitary) representation of the poincare

group; we denote by is,

(ua,) (p)  eiap

it  l the spatial (resp. temporal) inversions.
for   l,
(is  p).
it

(1  p)

(uit) (p)  it

let us dene on h the following non-degenerate sesquilinear form:

d+

(, )  zx +
here g  l is the minkowski matrix with diagonal elements 1,1,1,1.

0 (p) (p)(p) = zx +

0 (p)

d+

then one easily establishes that we have

0

g(p)(p) = < , g2 >;

0

(2.14)

(2.15)

(ua,, ua,) = (, ),

for   l,

we have now two elementary results:

lemma 2.5 let us consider the following subspace of h:

(uit, uit) = (, )..

(2.16)

h  {  h|

p(p) = 0}.

then the sesquilinear form (,)|h is positively dened.
we denote kk2  (, ).

lemma 2.6 let us consider the following subspace of h:

then the elements of h are of the form

h  {  h|

kk = 0}.

(p) = pf(p) + pf(p)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

where f : x +

0  c4 is a borel function verifying the transversality condition:

pf(p) = 0.

then we have the following result:

proposition 2.7 the representation (2.16) of the poincare group leaves invariant the sub-
spaces h and h and so, it induces an representation in the hilbert space

(here by the overline we understand completion). the factor representation, denoted also by
u is unitary and irreducible. by restriction to the proper orthochronous poincare group it is
equivalent to the representation from the preceding theorem.

hgraviton  (h/h)

(2.20)

3 second quantization

here we give the main concepts and formul connected to the method of second quantization.
we follow essentially [27] ch. vii (see also [2] and [1]).

the idea of the method of second quantization is to provide a canonical framework for
a multi-particle system in case one has a hilbert space describing an elementary particle.
one usually takes the one-particle hilbert space h to be some projective unitary irreducible
representation of the poincare group. let h be a (complex) hilbert space; the scalar product
on h is denoted by < , >. one rst considers the tensor algebra

t (h)  

n=0

hn,

(3.1)

where, by denition, the term corresponding to n = 0 is the division eld c. the generic
element of t (h) is of the type (c, (1),   , (n),  ), (n)  hn; the element 0  (1, 0, . . .)
is called the vacuum. let us consider now the symmetrisation (resp. antisymmetrisation)
operators s dened by

s  

n=0s

n

where s

0 = 1 and s
n , n  1 are dened on decomposable elements in the usual way
s
n 1      n 

(p )p (1)      p (n).

1

n! xp pn

here pn is the group of permutation of the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n, |p| is the sign of the permutation
p and +(p ) = 1,
n to arbitrary elements of t by linearity and continuity; it is
convenient to denote the elements in dened by these relations by 1   n and respectively
by 1      n.

(p ) = (1)|p | are the one-dimensional representations of pn.

one extends the operators s

we now dene the bosonic (resp. fermionic) fock space according to:

obviously we have:

where

f (h)  st (h);

f (h) = 

n=0h

n

are the so-called nth-particle subspaces.

h
0  c, h

n  s

n

hn

(n  1)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

the operations  (resp. ) make f (h) into associative algebras. one denes in the
let

bosonic (resp. fermionic) fock space the creation and annihilation operators as follow:
  h be arbitrary. in the bosonic case they are dened on elements from   h+

n by

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.7)

(3.8)

a()  n + 1  

and respectively

a() 

1
n

i

8

where i is the unique derivation of the algebra f +(h) verifying

i1 = 0;

i =< ,  > 1.

(3.9)

remark 3.1 we note that the general idea is to associate to every element of the one-particle
space   h a couple of operators a() acting in the fock space f +(h).

as usual, we have the canonical commutation relations (ccr):

[a(), a()] = 0,

(cid:2)a(), a()(cid:3) = 0,

(cid:2)a(), a()(cid:3) =< ,  > 1.

the operators a(), a() are unbounded and adjoint one to the other.
in the fermionic case we dene these operators on elements from   h

n by

a()  n + 1  

and respectively

a() 

1
n

i

where i is the unique graded derivation of the algebra f (h) verifying

i1 = 0;

i =< ,  > 1.

now we have the canonical anticommutation relations (car):

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

{a(), a()} = 0, (cid:8)a(), a()(cid:9) = 0, (cid:8)a(), a()(cid:9) =< ,  > 1.

the operators a(), a() are bounded and adjoint one to the other.
if u is a unitary (or antiunitary) operator on h, it lifts naturally to an operator (u) on

the tensor algebra t (h), according to

or, more explicitly, on decomposable elements

(u)  

0 u n

(u)(1      n) = u1      un.

(3.15)

(3.16)

the operator (u) leaves invariant the symmetric and resp. the antisymmetric algebras

f (h) and we have

(u)a()(u 1) = a(u).

(3.17)

if a is an self-adjoint operator on h then we dene on t (h) the self-adjoint operator d(a)

according to

d(a)(1      n) = a1      n +    1      an,

(3.18)

continuity and linearity; d(a) leaves f (h) invariant.

4 the quantization of the gravitational field

in this section we apply the prescription from section 3 to the hilbert space of the graviton
hgraviton given by (2.4). the idea is similar to the case of the photon, namely to express the
(bosonic) fock space of the graviton

as a factorization of the type (2.4). it is natural to start with the bigger fock space

fgraviton  f +(hgraviton)

h  f +(h)  n0hn

(4.1)

(4.2)

where the nth-particle subspace hn is the set of borel functions (n)
which are square summable:

1,1;...;n,n : (x +

0 )n  c

z(x +

(4.3)

verify the following properties:

(a) symmetry in the triplets (ki, i, i),
(b) symmetry in every couple (i, i),
(c) tracelessness in every couple (i, i),
in h the expression of the scalar product is:
xn=1z(x +

0 )n



i = 1, . . . , n;

i = 1, . . . , n;

i = 1, . . . , n.

(n)

1,1;...;n,n(k1, . . . , kn)(n)

1,1;...;n,n(k1, . . . , kn)

and we have a (non-unitary) representation of the poincare group given by:

ug  (ug),

g  p;

here ug is given by (2.14).

let us dene the following non-degenerate sesquilinear form on h:

(, )  (0)(0) +

group:

then the sesquilinear form (,) behaves naturally with respect to the action of the poincare
(4.7)

(uit,uit) = (, ).

g  p ,
we denote ||2 =< ,  > and kk2 = (, ).
now one has from lemma 2.5:

(ug,ug) = (, ),

10

lemma 4.1 let us consider the following subspace of h:
h  f +(h) = n0h
n.

(4.8)

then h

n, n  1 is generated by elements of the form 1    n,

in the representation adopted previously for the hilbert space hn we can take

1, . . . , n  h and,

n = {(n)  hn| k1
h

1 (n)

1,1;...;n,n(k1, . . . , kn) = 0}.

(4.9)

moreover, the sesquilinear form (,)|h is positively dened.
next, one has the analogue of lemma 2.6:

lemma 4.2 let h  h given by

h  {  h|
then, the subspace h
n  1 is generated by elements of the type 1      n where at
n,
least one of the vectors 1, . . . , n  h belongs to h.
moreover, in the representation adopted previously for the hilbert space hn the elements of
h
n are linearly generated by functions of the type:

kk2 = 0} = n0h

(4.10)

n

(n)

1,1;...;n,n(k1, . . . , kn) =

xi=1
[(ki)ifi(ki) + (ki)ifi(ki)] 
n
(n1)
1,1;..., i, i;...;n,n(k1, . . . , ki, . . . , kn)

with   h and f : x +

0  c4 verifying the transversality condition: kf(k) = 0.

finally we have:

proposition 4.3 there exists an canonical isomorphism of hilbert spaces

fgraviton  h/h.

(4.11)

(4.12)

proof: if   h then we denote its class with respect to h by []; similarly, if   h we
denote its class with respect to h by []. then the application i : h/h  fgraviton is well

i([1      n])  [1]      [n]

(4.13)

and it is the desired isomorphism. moreover, the sesquilinear form (,) is strictly positive
dened on the factor space, so it induces a scalar product. (cid:4)
now we can dene the gravitational eld as an operator on the hilbert space h in analogy

to the construction used for the scalar eld (see [10]).

one can describe in a convenient way the subspaces h and h using the following operators

l(f )  zr4

 (x), l(f )  zr4
where f : r4  r4 verify the transversality condition: f 
result:

dxf (x)h()

dxf (x)h(+)

 (x)

(4.30)

x = 0. indeed, one has the following

13

proposition 4.5 the following relations are true:
h = {  h| l(f ) = 0,

and

h = {l(f )|   h,

it follows that we have

f} = f ker(l(f ))

f} = f im(l(f )).

fgraviton = f ker(l(f ))/ f im(l(f )).

(4.31)

(4.32)

(4.33)

we construct now some observables on the fock space of the graviton fgraviton. as in the
case of the photon, we will distinguish a class of observables which are induced by self-adjoint
operators on the hilbert space h. indeed, if o is such an operator and it leaves invariant the
subspaces h and h then it factorizes to an operator on fgraviton according to the formula

this type of observables are called gauge invariant observables. not all observables on

[o][]  [o].

(4.34)

fgraviton are of this type. now we have the following result:
lemma 4.6 an operator o : h  h induces a gauge invariant observable if and only if it
veries:
(4.35)

[l(f ), o]|h = 0,

f.

we end with some comments regarding the perturbative construction of the s-matrix in
the sense of bogoliubov. perturbation theory, relies considerably on the axiom of causality, as
shown by h. epstein and v. glaser [6]. according to bogoliubov and shirkov, the s-matrix is
constructed inductively order by order as a formal series of operator valued distributions:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

in

n! zr4n

dx1    dxn tn(x1,   , xn)g(x1)   g(xn),

(4.36)

where g(x) is a tempered test function that switches the interaction and tn are operator-valued
distributions acting in the fock space of some collection of free elds; in [6] (see also [8]) one
considers in detail the case of a real free scalar eld. these operator-valued distributions, which
are called chronological products should verify some properties which can be argued starting
from bogoliubov axioms.

loosing generality:

 first, it is clear that we can consider them completely symmetrical in all variables without
(4.37)

tn(xp (1),   xp (n)) = tn(x1,   xn),

p  pn.

 next, we must have poincare invariance:

ua,tn(x1,   , xn)u 1

a, = tn(  x1 + a,   ,   xn + a),

  l.

(4.38)

14

in particular, translation invariance is essential for implementing epstein-glaser scheme of
renormalisation.

 the central axiom seems to be the requirement of causality which can be written compactly
as follows. let us rstly introduce some standard notations. denote by v +  {x  r4| x2 >
x0 > 0} and v   {x  r4| x2 > 0,
x0 < 0} the upper (lower) lightcones and by
0,
if x  {x1,   , xm}  r4m and y  {y1,   , yn}  r4m are such that
v  their closures.
xi  yj 6 v ,
j = 1, . . . , n we use the notation x  y. we use the compact
notation tn(x)  tn(x1,   , xn) and by x  y we mean the juxtaposition of the elements of
x and y . in particular, the expression tn+m(x  y ) makes sense because of the symmetry
property (4.37). then the causality axiom writes as follows:

i = 1, . . . , m,

tn+m(x  y ) = tm(x)tn(y ),

x  y.

(4.39)

 the unitarity of the s-matrix can be most easily expressed (see [6]) if one introduces, the

following formal series:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

(i)n
n! zr4n

dx1    dxn tn(x1,   , xn)g(x1)   g(xn),

(4.40)

where, by denition:

n

(1)|x| tn(x) 

xr=1

(1)r xn1++nr=n xpartitions

tn1(x1)   tnr (xr);

(4.41)

here x1,   , xr is a partition of x, |x| is the cardinal of the set x and the sum runs over all
partitions. one calls the operator-valued distributions tn anti-chronological products. it is not
very hard to prove that the series (4.40) is the inverse of the series (4.36) i.e. we have:

as formal series. then the unitarity axiom is:

s(g) = s(g)1

tn(x) = tn(x),

n  n,

x.

(4.42)

(4.43)

 the existence of the adiabatic limit can be formulated as follows. let us take in (4.36)
(4.44)

g  g where   r+ and

g(x)  g(x).

then one requires that the limit

s  lim

0

s(g)

(4.45)

exists, in the weak sense, and is independent of the the test function g. in other words, the
operator s should depend only on the coupling constant g  g(0). equivalently, one requires
that the limits
(4.46)

tn(gn



), n  1

tn  lim

0

15

exists, in the weak sense, and are independent of the test function g. one also calls the limit
performed above, the infrared limit.

 finally, one demands the stability of the vacuum i.e.

lim
0

< 0, s(g)0 >= 1  lim

0

< 0, tn(gn



)0 >= 0,

n  n.

(4.47)

a renormalisation theory is the possibility to construct such a s-matrix starting from the

rst order term:

(4.48)
where l is a wick polynomial called interaction lagrangian which should verify the following
axioms:
(4.49)

t1(x)  l(x)

ua,l(x)u 1
[l(x),l(y)] = 0,

a, = l(  x + a),
s.t.

x, y  r4
l(x) = l(x)

  l,
(x  y)2 < 0,

(4.50)

(4.51)

(4.52)

and

l  lim

0l(g)

should exists, in the weak sense, and should be independent of the test function g. moreover,
we should have

< 0, l0 >= 0.

(4.53)

to construct such an operator is not exactly an easy matter. in fact, the set of relations
(4.49), (4.50) and (4.51) is a problem of constructive eld theory in the particular case when
the hilbert space is of the fock type. in the analysis of epstein and glaser [6], [8] it is argued
that the most natural candidates for interaction lagrangian l(x) are the wick polynomials.
in the familiar physicists language, the problem is to prove that no ultraviolet divergences
and no infrared divergences appear, i.e. the operators tn are nite and well dened and the
adiabatic limit exists. the only freedom left in this case for a renormalisation theory is the
non-uniqueness of the tns due to nite normalization terms (also called counterterms) which
are distributions with the support {x1 =    = xn = 0}. the whole construction can be based
on the operation of distribution splitting; there are very eective ways to perform this operation
explicitly [20].

in the case of gravitation, one should modify the preceding axioms of perturbation theory
as follows. one constructs the whole theory in the auxiliary hilbert space h and imposes the
axioms as presented above; then one requires that the resulting s-matrix factorizes, in the
adiabatic limit, to the physical hilbert space fgraviton. we will give the explicit form of this
factorization axiom at the end of the next section for the case of quantization with ghosts.
if the adiabatic limit do not exists (as it is presumably the case for zero mass systems as
the graviton) one has to consider the factorization axiom as an heuristic relation and should
replace it by another postulate (see [20], [5]).

5 quantisation with ghost fields

in this subsection we give the complete analysis of another realisation of fgraviton which is
essential for the construction of the perturbation theory in the sense of the preceding section.
we we exhibit a construction which seems to be new in the literature and give complete proofs,
following the lines of [10].

first, we give consider the hilbert space

(q1, . . . , ql) and r  (r1, . . . , rs).

(2) they verify the following (anti)symmetry properties:
(a) symmetry at the permutation of the triplets (ki, i, i)  (kj, j, j),
(b) symmetry at the change i  i,
(c) antisymmetry at the permutation of the couples (pi, i)  (pj, j),
(d) antisymmetry at the permutation of the couples (qi, i)  (qj, j),
(e) antisymmetry in the variables ri,
(3) tracelessness in every couple (i, i),
in this representation we dene the annihilation operators according to the expressions:

we note that the hilbert space h given by (4.2) can be naturally embedded into hgh as

follows:

moreover, this embedding preserves the expressions of the operators h#

call the fock space hgh the ghost extension of h. remark the choice of the various statistics
which seems to be essential for the whole analysis.

in this hilbert space a (non-unitary) representation of the poincare group acts in an obvious
way and the creation and annihilation operators dened above behave naturally with respect
to these poincare transformations.

then we can dene, beside the gravitational eld (see the preceding section) the following

fermionic elds

and the bosonic eld

u(x) 

(x) 

which are called ghost elds. they verify the wave equations:

(cid:3)u(x) = 0, (cid:3)u(x) = 0, (cid:3)(x) = 0

(5.20)

and if we identify, as usual the positive (negative) frequency parts we have the canonical
anticommutation relations:

 (x), u()

{u()

 (y)} = 0,
 (x), u()
{u()



[()(x), ()(y)] = 0,

(5.21)

called supercharge. its properties are summarised in the following proposition which can be
proved by elementary computations:

in particular (5.27) justify the terminology of supercharge and (5.28) suggests that we should

compute the quotient. we will rigorously prove that this quotient coincides with fgraviton.
starting from the denition (5.21) we immediately get:

let us also give the explicit expression of the supercharge which will be needed further;

where, of course, we use bourbaki convention p  0.

remark 5.2 let us note that the relations (5.23), (5.24) and (5.22) are uniquely determining
the expression of the supercharge.

now we introduce on hgh the krein operator which in compact tensorial notations looks:
(5.32)

(j)(nmls) (k; p ; q; r)  (1)ml+ng2n+m+l(nlms)(k; q; p ; r).

the properties of this operator are given below and can be proved by elementary computa-

tions:

proposition 5.3 the following relations are veried:

jb(p)j = c(p),

j  = j 1 = j

jd(p)j = d(p),
jqj = q

and

jh

(p)j = h

(p)

ugj = jug,

g  p.

(5.33)

(5.34)

(5.35)

(5.36)

here o is the adjoint of the operator o with respect to the scalar product < , > on hgh.

we can dene now the sesquilinear form on hgh according to

(, ) < , j >;

(5.37)

then this form is non-degenerated. it is convenient to denote the conjugate of the arbitrary
operator o with respect to the sesquilinear form (,) by o i.e.

(o, ) = (, o).

then the following formula is available:

o = joj.

as a consequence, we have

(5.38)

(5.39)

h(x) = h(x),

u(x) = u(x),

u(x) = u(x), (x) = (x).

(5.40)

from (5.36) it follows that we have:

(ug,ug) = (, ),g  p ,

(uit,uit) = (, ).

(5.41)

now, we concentrate on the description of the factor space ker(q)/im(q). the following
analysis, which is essential for the understanding of graviton description seems to be missing
from the literature. we will construct a homotopy for the supercharge q. we make an
anszatz:

21

proposition 5.4 let us dene the operator

q  zx +

0

d+

0 (q)(cid:16)f ;(k)hh(k)b

(k) + h

(k)c(k)i + af (k) [c(k)d(k) + b

(k)d(k)](cid:17)

(5.42)

with borel functions f , f ; (which is symmetric in  and ) and a a real number.

then one can choose these functions in such a way that the following relation is valid:

y  {q, q} = nb + nc + nd + d(p )  1  1  1

(5.43)

where nb, nc and nd are particle number operators for the ghosts of type b (resp. c and d) and
p is the projector operator acting in the one-particle graviton space according to the a formula
of the following type:

moreover the following relations are true:

(p )(k)  g

(k)(k).

and

q2 = 0

[y, q] = 0,

[y, q] = 0.

(5.44)

(5.45)

(5.46)

proof: (i) first, one computes the generic expression y using (5.21) and (5.42). by

elementary computations we get

y = zx +

0

where

and

d+

0 (k)[f ;(k)h

[f;k + a(fk + fk)].

(5.48)

(5.49)

(5.50)

(ii) next, we use the expressions for h#

 and prove that the rst contribution in (5.47) can

be rewritten as d(p )  1  1  1 where the operator p has the expression (5.44) with

g; = (cid:18)f; 

1
4

gf 

;(cid:19) .

(5.51)

(iii) finally, we must make an convenient anszatz for the functions f  and f ;. we can

nd out [10] a function f : x +

0  c4 such that
kf (k) = 1,

f (k)f(k) = 0.

(5.52)

22

then we take

f; = fg + fg + bffk + c(fk + kf)f

with b and c real numbers, and impose the following conditions:

g;g; = g



(5.53)

(5.54)

(which ensures that the operator p given by the expression (5.44) is indeed a projector) and

f = g, h = 0.

(5.55)

by elementary but tedious computations one nds out that these conditions are fullled if
we take a = 1, b = 1 and c = 0. as a result, the formula (5.43) for y from the statement
follows. the next two formul from the statement are now the result of some elementary
computations. (cid:4)

we call the operator q the homotopy of q. we have now

proposition 5.5 the operator y |hnmls

is invertible i m + l + s > 0.

proof: we have the direct sum decomposition of the one-graviton subspace into the direct
sum of ran(p ) and ran(1  p ). let us consider a basis in the one-particle bosonic subspace
formed by a basis fi,

it is clear that a basis in the nth-gravitons subspace is of the form:

i  n of ran(p ) and a basis gi,

i  n of ran(1  p ).

fi1     fiu  gj1      gjv,

u, v  n,

u + v = n.

applying the operator d(p ) to such a vector gives the same vector multiplied by u. so,
in the basis chosen above, the operator d(p ) is diagonal with diagonal elements from n. it
follows that the operator y |hnmls
can also be exhibited into a diagonal form with diagonal
u  n. it is obvious now that for m + l + s > 0 this is an
elements of the form m + l + s + u,
invertible operator. (cid:4)

now we have a two results which are proved in complete analogy with [10].

corollary 5.6 let us dene h0  n0hn000 and h1  n0,m+l+s>0hnmls. then the opera-
tor y has the block-diagonal form

y = (cid:18) y1

0

0

y0(cid:19)

with y1 an invertible operator.

next, we have the following important proposition.

proposition 5.7 there exists the following vector spaces isomorphism:

ker(q)/im(q)  h/h

(5.56)

(5.57)

where the subspaces h and h have been dened in the previous subsection (see the lemmas
4.1 and 4.2 respectively).

23

proof: the rst two steps of the proof are taken directly from [10] without changes.
(i) we note that the operators q and q have the block-diagonal form

q = (cid:18) q11 q10

0 (cid:19) ,

q01

q = (cid:18) q11
q01

q10
0 (cid:19)

and from the relations (5.46) it easily follows that we have

[y1, q11] = 0

(5.58)

(5.59)

(5.60)
and similar relations for the block-diagonal elements of the homotopy operator q. in particular
we have

y1q10 = q10y0,

y0q01 = q01y1

[y1, q10 q01] = 0.

(ii) let now   ker(q). if we apply the relation to (5.43) the vector  we obtain:

y  = q

(5.61)

(5.62)

(5.63)

where we have dened

  q.

if we use the block-decomposition form for the vectors  and  we have in particular, from

this relation that

0 = q011.

if we use this relation in (5.62) we obtain in particular that

y11 = q111 + q10 q011.

because the operator y1 is invertible, we have from here

1 = y 1

1 q111 + y 1

1 q10 q011.

but from (5.59) and (5.61) we immediately obtain

[y 1

1

, q11] = 0,

[y 1

1

, q10 q01] = 0

so the preceding relations becomes:

1 = q11y 1

1 1 + q10 q01y 1

1 1.

now we dene the vector  by its components:

1  y 1

1 1, 0  q01y 1

1 1

and we get by a simple computation

  q = (cid:18) 0
0(cid:19)

24

(5.64)

(5.65)

(5.66)

(5.67)

(5.68)

where

in other words, if   ker(q) then we have

0  0  q011.

 = q + 

(5.69)

where

(5.70)
(iii) the condition q = 0 amounts now to q  = 0 or, with the explicit expression of the

(nmls) = 0, m + l + s > 0.

supercharge (5.31):

q (n+1,0,0,0)

,11,...,nn;;(q, k1, . . . , kn;;;) = 0,

n  n

(5.71)

i.e. the ensemble { (n000)}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)nn

is an element from h (see lemma 4.1).

we determine now in what conditions  is an element from im(q) i.e. we have  = q.
it is clear that only the components (n100) should be taken non-null. then the expression of
the supercharge (5.31) gives for any n  n the following expressions:

(q)(n000)

11,...,nn;; (k1, . . . , kn;;;) =

n

xi=1

[(ki)i

1
k
2n
i gii] 
(n1,1,0,0)
11,..., i i,...,nn;;;(k1, . . . , ki, . . . , kn; ki;;).

i + (ki)i

i

2

the condition  = q implies (q)(n110) = 0 thats it

q(n+1,1,0,0)

,11,...,nn;;(q, k1, . . . , kn; p;;) = 0

and (q)(n001) = 0 which is

r(n,1,0,0)

11,...,nn;;(k1, . . . , kn; r;;) = 0.

(5.72)

(5.73)

(5.74)

from (5.74) it follows that the last term from the square bracket in (5.72) gives zero and we
have in fact:

(q)(n000)

11,...,nn;; (k1, . . . , kn;;;) =

n

2n

i] 
(n1,1,0,0)
11,..., i i,...,nn;;;(k1, . . . , ki, . . . , kn; ki;;).

i + (ki)i

[(ki)i

xi=1

(5.75)

if we take (n1,1,0,0) to be decomposable i.e. of the form (n1,1,0,0)(k; p;;) = (k)f (p)
then from (5.73) it follows that  is an element of h and from (5.74) it follows that the
function f veries the transversality condition (2.5). this means that the expression (5.75) is
n (see (4.11)). the isomorphism from the statement is now []  [ ] where
an element from h
in the left hand side we take classes modulo im(q) and in the right hand side we take classes
modulo h. (cid:4)

we now have some standard results (see [10]):

25

lemma 5.8 the sesquilinear form (,) induces a strictly positive dened scalar product on
the factor space ker(q)/im(q).

lemma 5.9 the representation of u of the poincare group factors out at ker(q)/im(q).

the main result follows:

theorem 5.10 the isomorphism (5.57) extends to a hilbert space isomorphism:

ker(q)/im(q)  fphoton.

we end this section with a comparison with the alternative formulation of the quantization
process as presented in [17] and possible obstacles. we rst note that the commutation relations
for the gravitational eld (4.26) dier from the similar relations appearing in [17]. so we must
rst settle this point. is there a exibility in the formalism presented up till now such that one
can obtain the commutations relations as presented in [17] ? we will show that this is possible.
the idea is the following one. first, we make the following modications in proposition 2.1.
we replace f by

and b by

f  {h|h = h}

b  {(p, h)|p  x +
0 ,

h  f,

h

p = 0,

h

 = 0}

thats it we move the condition of tracelessness form the denition of f into the denition of
b. it is easy to see that the assertions of the propositions 2.1 and 2.2 remain true. also the
assertions of the proposition 2.3 and of the fundamental theorem 2.4 stay true if we modify
appropriately the borel set [b], namely we take

(5.76)

(5.77)

[b]  {(p, [h])|p  x +
0 ,

[h]  [f],

h

p = 0,

h

 = 0,

h  [h]}.

(5.78)

in the same way, we note that lemma 2.5 stays true if we take

h  {  h|

p(p) = 0, 

(p) = 0}.

(5.79)

at last, in the denition of hilbert space h (see the beginning of the section 4) one should

give up the tracelessness condition (c) and redene h
1,1;...;n,n(k1, . . . , kn) = 0,

n = {(n)  hn| k1
h

1 (n)

n as follows:

g11(n)

1,1;...;n,n(k1, . . . , kn) = 0}(5.80)

and the lemmas 4.1, 4.11 and the proposition 4.3 remain true.

now we can adopt other denition for the annihilation and creation operators (4.14) and

(4.15), namely:

(cid:20)(n+1)

,;1,1;...;n,n(p, k1, . . . , kn) 

1
2

gg(n+1)

,;1,1;...;n,n(p, k1, . . . , kn)(cid:21) ,

n  n (5.81)

(h(p))(n)

1,1;...;n,n

(k1, . . . , kn)  n + 1

26

and

(p)(cid:1)(n)
(cid:0)h

1,1;...;n,n

(k1, . . . , kn) 

n

(p)
n
(n1)
1,1;...; i, i;...;n,n(k1, . . . , ki, . . . , kn),

xi=1

(p  ki) (gigi + gigi  ggii)

n  n.

(5.82)

in this case, one can see that everything said in section 4 stays true with the exception of
some of the commutation relation, namely the last relation (4.16), the rst relation (4.26) and
the relation (4.27) which become respectively:

hh(p), h
hh()
 (x), h()

(p)i = (p)(cid:18)gg + gg 
()(y)i =

1
2

(gg + gg  gg) d()

0

1
2

gg(cid:19) (p  p)1,

(x  y)  1,

and

[h(x), h(y)] =

1
2

(gg + gg  gg) d0(x  y)  1.

(5.83)

(5.84)

(5.85)

so, we have obtained the commutation relations from [17]. now we consider instead of
the auxiliary hilbert space hgh dened by (5.1) the subspace corresponding to s = 0 i.e. we
eliminate completely from the game the scalar ghost. the expression of the supercharge (5.21)
becomes

q  zx +

0

d+

0 (k)k(cid:2)h(k)c(k) + h

(k)b(k)(cid:3)

(5.86)

where, of course the operators h#
 have the modied expressions from above; this is exactly
the expression from [17]. in this case one can prove that the most important property of the
supercharge, namely (5.27) remains valid. however, we have been unable to nd a corresponding
homotopy operator for this supercharge. one can easily see that an anszatz of the type (5.42)
and (5.53) will not gives an operator q with desired properties. even if such an operator could
be found, it is doubtful if we will have a result of the type described in proposition 5.7; indeed,
the relation (5.71) gets modied in our case into:

q (n+1,0,0)

,11,...,nn;;(q, k1, . . . , kn;;) =

qg (n+1,0,0)

,11,...,nn;(q, k1, . . . , kn;;),

n  n

(5.87)
and it is impossible to obtain from this relation the transversality and tracelessness conditions
from the denition of h
n appearing in (5.80). so, it is not clear if the quantum system described
in [17] is indeed a system of massless particles of helicity 2.

6 gauge-invariant observables

we analyse here the construction of observables on the factor space from the theorem 5.10.

by direct calculus we have the following relations:

{q, u()

 (x)} = 0,

{q, u()

 (x)} = i(cid:20)h()

 (x) +

1

()(x)(cid:21)

[q, h(x)] =

gg(cid:19) u(x),

[q, (x)] = iu(x).

(6.4)

next, we denote by w the linear space of all wick monomials on the fock space hgh i.e.
containing the elds h(x), u(x), u(x) and (x). if m is such a wick monomial, we dene
by gh(m) the degree in u (resp. in u). the total degree of m is

the ghost number is, by denition, the expression:

deg(m)  gh+(m) + gh(m).

gh(m)  gh+(m)  gh(m).

if m  w let us dene the operator:

dqm : qm : (1)gh(m ) : mq :

on monomials m and extend it by linearity to the whole w. then dqm  w and

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)
the operator dq : w  w is called the brst operator; other properties of this object are

(6.9)

(6.10)

(6.11)

now we have a series of results which are closely analogous to those derived in [10]. first, we
distinguish a class of observables on the factor space from theorem 5.10; we have the following
result:
lemma 6.2 if o : hgh  hgh veries the condition
dqo = 0

(6.12)

then it induces a well dened operator [o] on the factor space ker(q)/im(q)  fphoton.
operator [o]:

moreover, in this case the following formula is true for the matrix elements of the factorized

([], [o][]) = (, o).

(6.13)

this kind of observables on the physical space will also be called gauge invariant observables.

next, we have:
lemma 6.3 an operator o : hgh  hgh induces a gauge invariant observables if and only if
it veries:
(6.14)

dqo|ker(q) = 0.

not all operators verifying the condition (6.12) are interesting. in fact, we have from (6.9):

lemma 6.4 the operators of the type dqo are inducing a null operator on the factor space;
explicitly, we have:

[dqo] = 0.

(6.15)

moreover, we have:

theorem 6.5 let the interaction lagrangian be a wick monomial t1  w with gh(t1) 6= 0.
then the chronological product are null, i.e. there is no non-trivial s-matrix.

in the framework of pertubative quantum eld theory the axiom of factorization in the

adiabatic limit is:

lim

dqzr4

dx tn(x1, . . . , xn)|ker(q) = 0,

n  n.

if infrared divergences cannot be avoided, the one can consider the preceding relation at the

heuristic level and impose the postulate:

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) = i
