abstract

we consider chiral gauge theories dened over a xed four-dimensional space-time manifold with
a cartesian product structure for at least one compact spatial dimension, e.g. the product of
minkowskian 3-space and a circle. for a simple set-up, we calculate the eective gauge eld
action obtained from integrating out the chiral fermions, while maintaining gauge invariance.
due to a combination of infrared and ultraviolet eects, there appears a cpt-odd term in the
eective gauge eld action. this cpt anomaly could occur in chiral gauge theories which are
relevant to elementary particle physics, provided the space-time manifold has the appropriate
topology.

1 introduction

the cpt theorem is one of the most important results in local relativistic quantum
eld theory dened over at space-time [1, 2, 3]. the theorem states that the combined
operation (cpt) of charge conjugation (c), parity reection (p) and time reversal (t) is
an invariance of this class of theories, even if some of the separate invariances do not hold.
any cpt violation is, therefore, believed to require fundamentally dierent physics, e.g.
quantum gravity [4, 5] or strings [6]. it may, then, come as a surprise that a particular
class of quantum eld theories (specically, chiral gauge theories) has given an indication
of cpt violation [7].

the theories considered in ref. [7] are non-abelian chiral gauge theories with one com-
pact spatial dimension singled-out by the prescribed four-dimensional space-time manifold
m. an example would be su(3) yang-mills theory [8] with a single triplet of left-handed
weyl fermions [9], dened over the at space-time manifold m = m 3  s 1, which is the
cartesian product of minkowskian 3-space and a circle. the perturbative chiral gauge
anomalies [10, 11, 12, 13] of this theory can be cancelled by the introduction of an octet
of elementary pseudo-scalar elds with the standard gauged wess-zumino action [14, 15].
surprisingly, there remains a non-perturbative su(3) gauge anomaly [16], which is similar
to, but not the same as, the witten su(2) gauge anomaly [17]. in this case, however, there
exists a local counterterm for the action which restores su(3) gauge invariance, but at the
price of lorentz non-invariance and cpt violation [7]. in other words, the non-abelian
chiral gauge anomaly is transmuted into a cpt anomaly. (the situation is analogous
to that of certain three-dimensional non-abelian gauge theories with massless fermions,
where gauge invariance is restored at the price of p- and t-violation and the non-abelian
gauge anomaly is transmuted into the so-called parity anomaly [18, 19, 20, 21].)

the particular counterterm presented in ref. [7] is the space-time integral of a chern-
simons density [22] involving three of the four gauge potentials. (the precise denition
will be given later.) such a term violates local lorentz invariance. also, the integrand
of the counterterm is cpt-odd, whereas the standard yang-mills action density is cpt-
even. this lorentz and cpt non-invariance would show up, to rst order, as a direction-
dependent rotation of the linear polarization of a plane wave of gauge elds traveling in
vacuo [23].

we have obtained some heuristic arguments of why the counterterm must violate
lorentz and cpt invariance, but the uniqueness of the counterterm has not been estab-
lished. if, on the other hand, the non-abelian chiral gauge anomaly is really as discussed
above, then the eective gauge eld action due to the chiral fermions, formulated and
regularized in a gauge-invariant manner, must exhibit some sign of cpt violation (and
lorentz non-invariance). it is the goal of the present paper to establish this cpt violation.
maintaining chiral gauge invariance, we will nd for space-time manifolds with appropri-
ate cartesian product structure a cpt-violating term in the eective gauge eld action
which is precisely equal to the counterterm presented in ref.
[7]. this cpt-violating

1

term does not appear in vector-like gauge theories, but can appear in any anomaly-free
chiral gauge theory.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we give the set-up of the problem
and establish our notation. in section 3, we choose some simple background gauge po-
tentials and nd a chern-simons term in the eective gauge eld action. the calculation
applies to both abelian and non-abelian chiral gauge groups, provided the theory is free of
chiral gauge anomalies. in section 4, we show that the chern-simons term found violates
cpt. in other words, these particular chiral gauge eld theories have a cpt anomaly if
gauge invariance is maintained. in section 5, we give some generalizations of our basic
result. also, we exhibit a class of chiral gauge theories which necessarily have the cpt
anomaly, as long as the space-time manifold has the appropriate topology. remarkably,
the so-called standard model of elementary particle physics can be embedded in some of
these anomalous theories. in section 6, nally, we present some remarks on how the cpt
theorem is circumvented and discuss two possible applications of the cpt anomaly.

2 set-up

for deniteness, we take space-time to be the at euclidean manifold

m = ir3  s 1 ,

(2.1)

with coordinates xm  ir3 and x4  s 1. at the end of the calculation, we can make the
wick rotation [24] from euclidean to minkowskian signature, with x4 corresponding to a
compact spatial coordinate. the length of the circle in the 4-direction is denoted by l.
throughout this paper, latin indices k, l, m, etc. run over the coordinate labels 1, 2, 3,
and greek indices , , , etc. over 1, 2, 3, 4. repeated coordinate (and internal) indices
are summed over. natural units with h = c = 1 are used.

we will rst consider non-abelian chiral gauge theories with a single irreducible rep-
resentation of massless left-handed fermions. specically, we take the standard chiral
yang-mills theory [8, 9] with gauge group g = so(10) and left-handed weyl fermions in
the complex representation r l = 16. (this particular model may have some relevance for
elementary particle physics, as part of a so-called grand-unied theory, cf. refs. [25, 26]).
the fermionic eld is then li(x), with spinor index  = 1, 2, and group index i = 1,
. . . , 16. the gauge potentials are a(x)  e aa
(x) t a, a = 1, . . . , 45, with e the gauge
coupling constant and t a the anti-hermitian generators of the lie group so(10) in the
representation chosen, normalized by tr (t at b) =  1

2 ab.

in this paper, we are interested in the eective gauge eld action obtained from inte-
grating out the chiral fermions, while maintaining gauge invariance. formally, we have
the following euclidean functional integral [24]

exp {w[a ]} = z d

l dl expni wh 

l, l, aio ,

(2.2)

2

for the weyl action

i wh 

l, l, ai = zm

d4x 

l i

 ( + a) l ,

(2.3)

with 
  (i~, 1 ) dened in terms of the 2  2 pauli matrices m and the 2  2 identity
matrix 1 . the so(10) chiral gauge theory is anomaly free [12, 13, 16, 17] and the eective
gauge eld action is invariant under local gauge transformations,

 w [ g (a + d) g1 ] =  w [a ] ,

g(x)  g ,

(2.4)

with d the exterior derivative for dierential forms (dg  g/x dx) and a  a dx
a lie-algebra-valued one-form.

if the chiral gauge theory considered is not anomaly free (for example, the theory
mentioned in the introduction, with g = su(3) and r l = 3), then the theory has to be
modied in order to make it gauge invariant. one way to restore gauge invariance is by
averaging over the gauge orbits,

exp { [a ]}  z dh expn  w [ h (a + d) h1 ]o .

(2.5)

the interpretation of the resulting theory with the variables h(x)  g is not entirely clear,
though [27]. another way to restore gauge invariance is by introducing further fermions,
which cancel the chiral anomalies of the original fermions [13]. in section 5, we will discuss
some of these theories with reducible fermion representations. all of these complications
are, however, not necessary for the anomaly-free chiral gauge theory considered here,
which has gauge group g = so(10) and fermion representation r l = 16.

at this point, there is no need to be specic about the regularization of the eective
gauge eld action  w [a ]. perhaps the regularization is best done by the introduction of
a space-time lattice cut-o, which (temporarily?) sacrices lorentz invariance but keeps
the gauge and chiral invariances. (see refs.
[28, 29] and references therein.) this last
observation, though, is important, since we intend to look for symmetry violations being
forced upon us by maintaining exact gauge invariance in a theory with genuine chiral
fermions.

3 calculation

as discussed in the introduction, our goal is to establish the presence of a cpt-violating
term in the eective gauge eld action. the strategy is to simplify the calculation as much
as possible. we, therefore, take the case of x4-independent so(10) gauge potentials, with
the one gauge potential corresponding to the special direction (x4  s 1 for the euclidean
manifold m = ir3  s 1) vanishing altogether,

am(~x, x4) = am(~x) , a4(~x, x4) = a4(~x) = 0 .

(3.1)

3

also, the gauge potentials considered vanish on the boundary of a ball b3 embedded in
ir3, and outside of it,

am(~x) = 0

for

|~x|  r ,

(3.2)

with r a xed radius which can be taken to innity at the end of the calculation.

the left-handed fermionic elds in the spinor representation 16 of so(10) can be ex-

panded in fourier modes

l(~x, x4) =


l(~x, x4) =





xn=
xn=

e+2inx4/l n(~x) ,

e2inx4/l 

n(~x) ,

and the weyl action (2.3) for the gauge potentials (3.1) becomes

i w =



xn= zir3

d3x l 

n(cid:16) m (m + am)  2n/l(cid:17) n .

redening the two (independent) spinor elds

n(~x)  i l n(~x) , 

n(~x)  

n(~x) ,

the action reads

i w =





xn= zir3
i 3h 
xn=



d3x 

n(cid:16) i m(m + am) + i 2n/l(cid:17) n

n, n, ai .

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

we have thus obtained an innite set of three-dimensional euclidean dirac elds n(~x)
with masses 2n/l, all of which interact with the same three-dimensional gauge potentials
am(~x).
(all this is, of course, reminiscent of kaluza-klein theory, which reduces ve
space-time dimensions to four. see refs. [30, 26] and references therein.)

for the special background potentials (3.1), the eective action (2.2) then factorizes to

expnw[ a ]o 



yn=(cid:18) z d

n dn expni 3h 

n, n, aio (cid:19) ,

(3.7)

with i 3 as dened in (3.6). each factor in (3.7) can be regularized separately by the
introduction of appropriate three-dimensional pauli-villars elds [31, 24]. this ultraviolet
regularization preserves the residual gauge invariance

n  u(g) n ,

am  g(cid:16) am + m(cid:17) g1 ,

g(~x)  g ,

(3.8)

4

with u the appropriate unitary representation for the fermions and gauge functions g(~x)
= 1 for |~x|  r. even though this is not the full gauge invariance (2.4) of the theory, it
turns out to be sucient for our purpose (see section 4).

in addition to the ultraviolet divergences in the separate factors of (3.7), which are
regularized by the corresponding three-dimensional pauli-villars elds, there are also
infrared divergences in the n = 0 factor. these infrared divergences can be regularized
by imposing antiperiodic boundary conditions for the dirac (and pauli-villars) elds on
the surface of the ball b3, where the gauge potentials (3.2) vanish.

the massive pauli-villars regulator elds for the n = 0 factor of (3.7), viewed as x4-in-
dependent four-dimensional elds, introduce a breaking of cpt and lorentz invariance in
the four-dimensional context. this breaking will show up later as a nite remnant in the
eective gauge eld action. (for the moment, it is an open question whether or not the
same happens for the lattice regularization mentioned in the last paragraph of section 2.)

for our calculation, it is sucient to introduce for each (anticommuting) eld n(~x)
with mass mn  2n/l a single (commuting) pauli-villars eld n(~x) with mass 0 for
n = 0 and n  mn + sign(n)  for n 6= 0, where  is taken to be positive. formally,
this gives for (3.7) the following product:

expnw[ a ]o  yk

k

k + i0   
yl=1

2
k + m 2
l

k + (ml + )2 ! ,

(3.9)

in terms of the real eigenvalues k of the massless three-dimensional dirac operator  i m
(m + am). the factors in (3.7) with n =  l, for l > 0, thus combine to give a real
contribution to the eective gauge eld action w[ a ]. moreover, it is clear that the
spectral ow [18, 19] of the full three-dimensional dirac operator can occur only in the
n = 0 factor (there is a mass-gap for n 6= 0), and that the non-abelian gauge anomaly,
which shows up in the imaginary part of w[ a ], resides there.

the imaginary part of the eective gauge eld action for massless three-dimensional
dirac fermions, with pauli-villars regularization to maintain gauge invariance, has already
been calculated [18, 19]. revisiting the perturbative calculation, we nd for non-abelian
gauge groups

the sign ambiguity s0 in (3.10) traces back to the parity-violating pauli-villars mass 0
used to regularize the ultraviolet divergences of the three-dimensional feynman diagrams.
(here, parity violation is meant in the three-dimensional sense. as will become clear in
the next section, three-dimensional parity corresponds to cpt in the four-dimensional
context [7].) the factor s0 in (3.10) comes, in fact, from a factor 0/|0| out of the
momentum integrals. the triangle diagram, for example, gives in the limit |0|  

1 z 

0

dq 4q2 0 (q2 + 2

0) (q2 + 2

0)3 = (0/|0|)   s0  ,

(3.12)

with the explicit factor 0 (q2 + 2
0) from the spinor trace in the integrand on the left-
hand side. it is crucial that the infrared divergences of the three-dimensional feynman
diagrams without pauli-villars elds are not regularized by the introduction of a small
dirac mass 0, which would again violate parity invariance, but that they are kept under
control by the antiperiodic boundary conditions imposed on the fermions (turning the
momentum integrals into sums).

the essential conditions for the derivation of (3.10) are thus the requirement of gauge
invariance (3.8) and the control of infrared divergences in the n = 0 factor of (3.7). for
non-abelian gauge groups, there is, in addition to the term (3.10) obtained in perturbation
theory, also a non-local term in am(~x) which restores the full three-dimensional gauge
invariance (3.8), not just its innitesimal version. this non-local term vanishes, however,
for gauge potentials am(~x) suciently close to zero. see refs.
[19, 21] and references
therein.

the integral in (3.10) can be extended over the whole of 3-space, because the gauge
potentials am vanish outside the ball b3. the gauge potentials am are also x4-independent
and, insisting upon translation invariance, the expression (3.10) can be written as the
following four-dimensional integral:

 n=0

w [ a ]  izir3

d3xz l

0

dx4 s0 (1 + a) 

l

 cs( a1(~x), a2(~x), a3(~x)) ,

(3.13)

with s0 =  1 as dened in (3.12) and parameter a = 0 for the non-abelian gauge groups
considered up till now. the perturbative calculation for three-dimensional abelian gauge
potentials gives essentially the same result [18, 20], with the factor  in (3.10) replaced
by 2  and the parameter a in (3.13) set equal to 1.

the chern-simons term (3.13), which comes from a combination of infrared (n = 0)
and ultraviolet (|0|  ) eects, is the main result of this paper. the result was
obtained for the particular chiral gauge theory with gauge group g = so(10) and fermion
representation r l = 16, but holds for arbitrary (non-)abelian gauge group and arbitrary
non-singlet irreducible fermion representation, as long as the fermion representation is

6

normalized appropriately and the full theory is free of chiral gauge anomalies (see section
5). this completes the calculations of this paper. in the next two sections, we will take
a closer look at the result and present some generalizations.

4 lorentz and cpt non-invariance

for the special gauge potentials (3.1), (3.2) and the euclidean space-time manifold m =
ir3  s 1, we have found in the previous section the emergence of a chern-simons term
(3.13) in the eective gauge eld action. the calculation, which relies on earlier results
for the three-dimensional parity anomaly, applies to both abelian and non-abelian gauge
groups, provided the chiral gauge anomalies cancel in the complete theory (see section
5). for arbitrary gauge potentials, the eective action term (3.13) can be written as the
following local expression:

cslike[a ] = izir3
 ir3s 1

d3xz l

0

dx4 s0 (1 + a) 

l

 cs(a1(~x, x4), a2(~x, x4), a3(~x, x4)),(4.1)

with an integer factor s0 =  1 as dened in (3.12), an integer parameter a = (0)1 for
(non-)abelian gauge groups, and the chern-simons density cs as given by (3.11). the
term (4.1) is called chern-simons-like, because a genuine topological chern-simons term
exists only in an odd number of dimensions [22]. eq. (4.1), for non-abelian gauge groups,
is precisely equal to the counterterm presented in ref [7].

ple, cs(a1(~x), a2(~x), a3(~x)), with the averaged gauge potentials am(~x)  l1r l

the local chern-simons-like term (4.1) has the important property of invariance under
innitesimal four-dimensional gauge transformations. (this property would not hold if
the particular chern-simons density cs as given by (4.1) were replaced by, for exam-
0 dx4
am(~x, x4). of course, such an eective action term using the averaged gauge potentials
am would not be local either.) for non-abelian gauge groups g, there are also large
gauge transformations with a gauge function g(~x, x4)  g corresponding to a non-trivial
element of the homotopy group 3(g) = zz. as mentioned in section 3, there is a non-local
term in the eective gauge eld action which restores invariance under these nite four-
dimensional gauge transformations, but this non-local term vanishes for gauge potentials
a(x) suciently close to zero. in addition, there are, for gauge groups g = so(n  3)
or u(1) with homotopy group 1(g) 6= 0, large gauge transformations with gauge func-
tions g = g(x4)  g, but the local eective action term (4.1) is obviously invariant under
these particular nite gauge transformations.

the eective action term (4.1) is translation invariant, but its chern-simons density
cs involves only three of the four gauge potentials a(x) and three of the six components
of the eld strength tensor a(x)  a  a + [ a , a ]. this makes the eective
gauge eld action manifestly lorentz non-invariant. physically, this would, for example,
lead to anisotropic propagation of the gauge boson elds [23].

7

note that the terms (4.1) applied to the gauge groups su(3), su(2), and u(1), with
undetermined coecients replacing s0 (1+a) /l, have also been considered in a standard-
model extension with lorentz violation [32]. the non-invariance of these terms under
certain large gauge transformations [7, 20] suggests that either these coecients must be
zero or that additional non-local terms restoring gauge invariance must be included in
the theory. as discussed above, the anomaly calculation of the present paper chooses the
second alternative, with non-local terms restoring gauge invariance.3

of the path-ordered integral (holonomy) tr p exp (r l

we are not able to determine the imaginary part of the eective gauge eld action
exactly. the eective action might, for example, have some dependence on the trace
0 dx4 a4), which could not have been
detected by the gauge potentials (3.1) used in section 3. but the partial result (3.13)
suces for the main purpose of this paper. the appropriate cpt transformation [1, 24]
for an anti-hermitian gauge potential is, namely,

a(x)  at

 (x) ,

(4.2)

with the sux t indicating the transpose of the matrix. using (4.2) one then readily veri-
es that the yang-mills action density tr (aa) is cpt-even and that the integrand of
the eective action term (3.13), or (4.1) for that matter, is cpt-odd. (the over-all factor
i in (3.13), or (4.1), is absent for space-time manifolds with minkowskian signature and
need not be complex conjugated.) this establishes the cpt anomaly for gauge theories
with chiral fermions in an arbitrary non-singlet irreducible representation (provided the
chiral gauge anomalies cancel in the complete theory) and euclidean space-time manifold
m = ir3  s 1.

the abelian chern-simons density has no cubic term and the abelian version of (4.1)
is odd under both cpt and t (and even under c and p), provided x4 corresponds to
a spatial coordinate after the wick rotation from euclidean to minkowskian signature.
the t and cpt violation would, for example, show up in the propagation of the circular
polarization modes of these abelian gauge elds, cf. ref. [23].

5 generalizations

the eective gauge eld action for certain chiral gauge theories dened over a xed four-
dimensional euclidean space-time manifold m with product structure ir3  s 1 has been
found to contain a cpt-violating term if gauge invariance is maintained. for the special
gauge potentials (3.1), this cpt-violating term is given by (3.13), which can be written
as (4.1) for arbitrary gauge potentials.

3the same is to be expected for the eective gauge eld action from fermions with explicit cpt-
violating, but gauge-invariant, terms in the action [32]. for recent results on the induced abelian chern-
simons-like term from a massive dirac fermion with a cpt-violating axial-vector term in the action, see
ref. [33] and references therein.

8

essentially the same result holds for other space-time manifolds m, as long as at least
one compact spatial dimension can be factored out. also, the spin structure over the
compact spatial dimension must be such as to allow for zero momentum of the fermions.
an example would be the at euclidean manifold m = ir3 i, with the closed interval i 
[0, l ]  ir replacing the circle s 1 considered before. here, the chiral fermions are taken to
have free boundary conditions over i. (for antiperiodic boundary conditions over i, there
would be no anomaly, cf. ref.
[7].) another example would be the at minkowski-like
manifold m = ir  s 1  s 1  s 1, with time t  ir and compact 3-space, which would have
three terms of the form (4.1) in the eective gauge eld action. similar eects may occur
in higher dimensional chiral gauge theories, but for the rest of this paper we concentrate
on the four-dimensional case, again with m = ir3  s 1.

the calculation of the cpt-violating term in section 3 was performed for a single
irreducible representation of left-handed weyl fermions. the particular theory considered,
with gauge group g = so(10) and fermion representation r l = 16, is free of chiral
gauge anomalies [12, 13, 16, 17]. it is, of course, possible to have more than one non-
singlet irreducible fermion representation for the left-handed fermions, provided the chiral

anomalies cancel. the reducible fermion representation is then r l = pf rf , with f

running over 1, . . . , nf .

vector-like gauge theories with, for example, a single irreducible representation r have
r l = r + r and corresponding three-dimensional pauli-villars masses 0r and 0r, where
r denotes the conjugate representation of r. four-dimensional parity invariance requires
that 0r and 0r have opposite signs. recalling (3.12), this implies that the cpt anomaly
(4.1) cancels for this particular vector-like gauge theory. the same cancellation occurs,
in fact, for any vector-like gauge theory.

chiral gauge theories with r l = pf rf (and r l 6= r l) may, or may not, have a cpt-

violating term (4.1) left over in the eective gauge eld action, depending on the relative
signs of the corresponding three-dimensional pauli-villars masses 0f . attention must
be paid to the normalization of the non-singlet irreducible representations rf . also, the
situation can be complicated further by having more three-dimensional pauli-villars elds
than the ones used in section 3. the factor s0 =  1 in (3.10), (3.13), and (4.1), would
then be replaced by (2 k0f + 1), for k0f  zz. see ref. [21] for further discussion.

for a chiral gauge theory with an odd number nf of equal

irreducible left-handed
fermion representations, there necessarily appears a cpt-violating term proportional to
(4.1) in the eective gauge eld action. the reason is that the sum of an odd number

of odd numbers does not vanish, pf (2 k0f + 1) 6= 0. an example would be the so(10)

chiral gauge theory with the reducible fermion representation r l = 16 + 16 + 16, which
necessarily has a cpt-violating term proportional to (4.1) for the so(10) gauge elds in
the eective action.

this particular so(10) model contains, as is well known, the su(3)  su(2)  u(1)
standard model [24, 26] with 3 families of 15 left-handed weyl fermions, together with 3

9

singlets of left-handed weyl fermions (conjugates of the hypothetical right-handed neu-
trinos). the standard model has thus a cpt-violating term proportional to (4.1) for the
hypercharge u(1) gauge elds in the eective action, together with similar terms for the
weak su(2) and color su(3) gauge elds, as long as the space-time manifold has a carte-
sian product structure and the standard model is embedded in this particular so(10)
chiral gauge theory.4 the so(10) embedding condition for the standard model guaran-
tees the presence of these cpt-violating terms, otherwise there may, or may not, appear
such terms, depending on the regularization scheme chosen.

6 discussion

in the previous section, we have established for certain chiral gauge theories the necessary
presence of a cpt-violating term in the gauge-invariant eective action. the question,
now, is what happened to the cpt theorem? it appears that the cpt theorem is cir-
cumvented by a break-down of local lorentz invariance at the quantum level. (see also
the paragraph above (3.9), which discusses the breaking of lorentz invariance by the ul-
traviolet regularization used.) more specically, the second-quantized vacuum seems to
play a role in connecting the global space-time structure to the local physics. this can
be explained as follows.

for non-abelian chiral gauge groups, there is the extra condition of gauge invariance in
these quantum eld theories which are potentially aicted by the non-perturbative chiral
gauge anomaly discovered earlier [16]. this non-perturbative chiral gauge anomaly de-
pends on the global space-time structure in a lorentz non-invariant way (one direction be-
ing singled-out by the so-called z-string conguration responsible for the gauge anomaly).
if the theory has indeed this z-string chiral gauge anomaly, then the restoration of gauge
invariance obviously requires interactions which are themselves lorentz non-invariant [7].
but, even if the theory does not have a net z-string chiral gauge anomaly, there still oc-
curs the spectral ow which treats one spatial dimension dierently from the others [16].
this implies that the second-quantized vacuum state changes under the corresponding
gauge transformations. imposing gauge invariance then leads to lorentz non-invariance
of the theory. in both cases, the invariance under the proper orthochronous lorentz group
is lost and the cpt theorem [1] no longer applies. there is then the possibility of having
a non-abelian cpt-odd term (4.1) in the eective gauge eld action.

for abelian chiral gauge groups, non-zero magnetic ux from monopoles can also give
rise to non-trivial spectral ow, as discussed for the three-dimensional case in ref. [20].
for the four-dimensional case, this set-up again breaks lorentz invariance (just as the z-
string does for the non-abelian gauge anomaly) and the cpt theorem no longer applies,

4it is not clear to what extent the 33 remaining gauge bosons from so(10) need to be physical, but

they could always be given large masses by the higgs mechanism [25, 26].

with the possibility of having an abelian cpt-odd term (4.1) in the eective gauge eld
action.

for both abelian and non-abelian chiral gauge groups, it remains to be seen whether
or not the gauge-invariant, but cpt-violating, theory is consistent, with, for example,
microcausality and positivity of the energy, cf. ref. [32]. if not, the theory could perhaps
be interpreted as part of a more fundamental theory, possibly involving gravity.

in this paper, we have primarily been concerned with the mechanism of the cpt
anomaly, not potential applications. let us, however, mention two possibilities. first,
there may be the optical activity [23] discussed in the introduction, where the linear
polarization of a plane wave of gauge elds gets rotated in vacuo (in our case, through
the quantum eects of the chiral fermions encoded in the eective gauge eld action).
as mentioned in section 5, the eect could occur for the photon eld of the standard
model [24, 26], as long as there is the so(10)-like embedding of the standard model and
the appropriate cartesian product structure of the space-time manifold. the laboratory
measurement of this optical activity of the vacuum could, in principle, provide information
about the global structure and size of the universe. more realistically, the mass scale of
the cpt-violating term (4.1) for the photon eld is of the order of

1/137!   1.5 1010 lyr

(6.1)

with   e2/4  the ne-structure constant and l the range of the compact spatial
coordinate. this mass is, of course, very small on the scale of the known elementary
particles (the present universe being very large), but, remarkably, it is only a factor 100
below the current experimental limit of  1033 ev obtained from observations on distant
radio galaxies, see refs. [23, 34] and references therein. (the laboratory has now been
expanded to a signicant part of the visible universe.) a dedicated observation program
to map the linear polarization in a large number of distant radio sources, or future satellite
experiments to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background, can perhaps
reach the sensitivity level set by (6.1).

second, the cpt anomaly may have been important in the very early universe. in the
present paper, we have considered a xed space-time manifold with given topology. with
gravity, space-time becomes dynamic. for an inverse size 1/l(t) and typical scattering
energies of the order of the gravitational scale (planck mass), the cpt-violating eects
of the eective action term (4.1) are relatively unsuppressed compared to gravity, that is
suppressed by the square of the gauge coupling constant only. of course, the fundamental
theory of gravity remains to be determined if there is indeed lorentz non-invariance in
certain inertial frames. still, it is conceivable that the cpt anomaly plays a role in
dening a fundamental arrow-of-time [4], as an eect coming from the interplay of
chiral fermions, gauge eld interactions and the topology of space-time.
