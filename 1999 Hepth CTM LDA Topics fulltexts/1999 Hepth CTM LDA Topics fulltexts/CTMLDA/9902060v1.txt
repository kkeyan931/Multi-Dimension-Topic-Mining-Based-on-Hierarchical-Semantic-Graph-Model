abstract

a simple algebraic technique is developed to obtain deformed energy spec-

tra for the poschl-teller potentials.

pacs 03.65.fd - algebraics methods.

1 introduction

there has been an increasing interest in quantum deformed systems during
the past decade [1]. the use of q-deformed algebras has been seen as a possi-
ble generalization of the usual algebrization of the schrodinger equation with
the use of lie algebras. there are several approaches to this problem. bon-
atsos et al. [2] have studied deformed harmonic and anharmonic oscillators
as a possible description of vibrational spectra of diatomic molecules. more
recently, cooper et al [3] have studied the deformation of the morse potential
using supersymmetric quantum mechanics (ssqm) and a group approach.
it is interesting to notice that almost all physical problems for which a de-
formation has been carried out belong to the class of potentials related to
conuent hypergeometric functions, i.e., coulomb, harmonic oscillator and
morse potentials, the only exception seems the case treated in [4].

in this paper, following the ideas developed in [3], we deal with two
potentials whose solutions are hypergeometric functions, the poschl-teller

i and ii, using only the spectrum generating algebra associated with these
potentials. no reference to ssqm is used.

recently in [5] it was shown that the hypergeometric natanzon potentials
[6], vn - those for which the schrodinger equation can be transformed to
an hypergeometric function- can be solved algebraically by means of the
so(2,1) algebra. this is an essential point for what is going to be done
later, so it is convenient to make a brief review of the subject. the basic
assumptions of this approach are: a) a two variable realization of so(2,1).
b) the schrodinger equation can be written in terms of the casimir operator
of the algebra c, as [h  e] (r, y) = g(r)[c  c](r, y) , where c is the
eigenvalue of c , h the hamiltonian and e the corresponding eigenvalue.
g(r) is a function xed by consistency, and c) the eigenfunctions of the
hamiltonian have the form (r, y) = exp(imy)(r).

the hypergeometric natanzon potentials are given by:

vn =

where

( f z(r)2  ( h0  h1 + f ) z(r) + h0 + 1)

the constants a, c0, c1, h0, h1 and f are called natanzon parameters.
the function z(r) must satisfy

the generators of the so(2,1) algebra: j1, j2 and j0 satisfy the usual
commutation relations:
,
as usual we dene j = j1  i j2. the casimir operator c is given by
c = j0(j0  1)  jj .the generators are then given by

[j0, j1] = ij2 , [j2, j0] = ij1 , [j1, j2] = ij0

eters:

2 deformed potentials

we proceed in a similar way as in reference [3] to obtain the deformed energy
spectra of the poschl - teller potentials. for this purpose we consider the
following bosonic realization of so(2,1) [8]

j+ = ab

, j = ab

, j0 =

1

2 (cid:16)aa + bb + 1(cid:17)

the operators a, a, b and b have the usual commutation relations : ha, ai =
hb, bi = 1, while the other commutators are zero. the basis for this realiza-

tion is given by

(11)

(12)

|j mi =

amj bm+j1

q(m  j)! (m + j  1)! |0i

in this basis, the operators dened in (11) satisfy the following relations

j |j mi = q(m  j  1) (m  j) |j m  1i

(13)

(14)
the casimir operator has eigenvalues: j (j  1) and j is assumed to be
the deformed states are dened as [9]

j0 |j mi = m |j mi

positive, m takes the values: m = j + ,  = 0, 1...

|j miq =

amj bm+j1

q[m  j]! [m + j  1]! |0iq

where [n]! = [1][2]..., [n] , with

and the q-boson operators satisfy the following commutations relations

[n] =

qn  qn
q  q1

aa  qaa = qna , [na , a] = a , [na , a] = a

(15)

(16)

(17)

with similar relations for the b operators. the relations given in (13) are
transformed into the following ones:

4

j |j miq = q[m  j] [m  j  1]
j0 |j miq = m |j miq

|j m  1iq

then the ladder operators dened in (13) satisfy the so(2,1)q algebra

[j0, j] =  j0 ,

[j+, j] = [2 j0]

(18)

(19)

(20)

we can now nd the deformed energy spectrum in the following way:
first we build up a bosonic representation of the hamiltonian for the system
in consideration- hb -in such a way that its spectrum coincides with the one
obtained from (8). the next step is a deformation of hb and the calculation
of its spectrum. let us consider a few examples, we follow the notation of
[10].
1) poschl-teller i potential
this potential is dened by

v = (a + b)2 + a(a  ) sec2(x) + b(b  ) csc2(x)

(21)

it is easily seen that the natanzon parameters for this potential are given by

a = 0, c0 = 0, c1 = 
h0 =

1
2
(2b + ) (2b  3)

42

, f =

, h1 =

(2a + ) (2a  3)
(a + b + ) (a + b  )

42

(22)

the function z(x) is obtained from (3) and it becomes z(x) =  tan2(x).
after a careful study of the signs of the square roots occurring in (8) one
nds that the energy spectrum of this system is

e() = 4( + a + b) ,

 = 0, 1, ...

(23)

from (10) we obtain for c, the eigenvalue of the casimir operator,

c =

from (7) m is found to be

1

42 (cid:16)(a + b + 2)2  2(cid:17)

(24)

and from (24)

m = 2 +

1
2

(a + b + ) = 2 + 

j =  +

1
2

(a + b + ) =  + 

(25)

(26)

where the parameter  is dened as :  = 1
adimensional energy of the system by e(), we have from (23)

2 (a + b + ). denoting the

e(, ) = 4( + 2  1)

(27)

for the values of j and m given in (25-26), the corresponding state will
be written as | i, then it is easily seen that: aa | i =  | i and
bb | i = (2 +   1) | i. with these results we can build a bosonic
representation of the hamiltonian operator hpt1 for this system as follows

then we have the expected result

hpt1 = aa (bb  2aa)

hpt1 | i = e(, ) | i

(28)

(29)

keeping the same form for the deformed hamiltonian as the one given in
(28), we obtain for the deformed version of (29)

with

hdpt1 | iq = e(, )q | iq

(30)

(31)

e(, )q = 4 [] ( [2 + 3  1]  2[] )
qbq  2a

and hdpt1  a
qaq). the expression (31) can be considered as the
deformed energy spectrum of the system, its limit as q  1 agrees with the
undeformed energy given in (23).

qaq(b

2) poschl-teller ii potential

it is dened by

v = (a  b)2  a(a + )sech2(r) + b(b  )csch2(r)

(32)

the natanzon parameters are

a = 0, c0 = 0, c1 =

, f =

(2b + )(2b  3)

42

h0 =

(2a  )(2a + 3)
(a  b + )(a  b + )

42

, h1 =

(33)

with this set of parameters one obtains from (3,8,9) , z(r) = tanh2(r) and
for the energy spectra

e() = 4 (  a + b) ,

 = 0, 1, ...

(34)

in this case c, m and j are given by

c =

m =

j =

42 (cid:16)(a  b  2)2  2(cid:17)

(a  b + )  
(a  b + )   =   

while e(, ) is now

the corresponding hamiltonian operator is a simple one

e(, ) = 4 (2    1)

for the deformed energy spectrum we nd

hpt2 = 4 j+j

e(, )q = 4 [] [2    1]

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

one easily see that the limiting case of (38) agrees with the result given in
(36).

at this point we would like to make a few remarks. one may ask why
we are considering these two potentials and not analyzing the rest of the
shape invariant hypergeometric potentials listed for example in [10]. there
are several reasons. we rst notice that the energy spectra of these class

7

of potentials have two main features, one is that there is a sub - class of
potentials whose their energy spectra is a quadratic expression involving 
while the spectrum of the other ones is a ratio of quadratic polynomials in
. in the rst case, there are only two cases where two natanzon parameters
occurs in the energy spectra, these are the cases treated here, in the remaining
two cases only one parameter appears. for the latter cases one can assume
that one parameter is proportional to the other and the results are not so
simple as the cases treated in this paper. for the remaining set of potentials,
the bosonization is not so clear since one has to get ratios of quadratics
polynomials in  .

finally we would like to mention that a polynomial deformation, in the
sense of delbecq et al [11], can be done in an simple way for the poschl-teller
ii potential. this is so because of the simple structure of hpt2 given in (37).
the algebra that we use is the a
representation
which is bounded below. these algebra satisfy the following commutation
relations

q (2, 1) , and we use the d(+)

q

[j0 , j+] = (1 + (1  q) j0) j+

[j0 , j+] = j (1 + (1  q) j0)

[j+ , j] = 2 j0 (1 + (1  q) j0)

for this algebra the casimir operator is given by

cq = j+ j 

2

1 + q

(q j0  1) j0

the eigenvalues of the casimir operator are written as follows

cq = 

2

(1 + q)

 ( + 1)

with  = q j < 0. the eigenvalues of j0 are

(39)

(40)

(41)

mq = j q 

1  q
1  q

,

 = 0, 1, ...

(42)

notice that mq  m in the limit q  1, in other words d(+)

q  d(+)
which is the representation that is used in the standard algebraic description
of the natanzon potentials.

as before, the deformed hamiltonian is assumed to have the same form

given in (37), then from (40) we can write this deformation as

h



pt2 = 4 (cq +

2

1 + q

(q j0  1) j0)

the eigenvalues of h



pt2 are thus given by



e

(, )q =

8

1 + q

( mq (qmq  1)  qj (qj + 1) )

(43)

(44)

where in the expression for mq we must use the results given in (35), namely
m =  and j =    .this is the deformed energy spectra for deformation
in consideration. it is easy to prove that in the q  1 limit one recovers
the result given in (36).
