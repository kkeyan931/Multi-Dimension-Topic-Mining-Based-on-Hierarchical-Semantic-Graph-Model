abstract

a covariant spinor representation of iosp(d, 2/2) is constructed for the quantization of
the spinning relativistic particle. it is found that, with appropriately dened wavefunc-
tions, this representation can be identied with the state space arising from the canonical
extended bfv-brst quantization of the spinning particle with admissible gauge xing
conditions after a contraction procedure. for this model, the cohomological determina-
tion of physical states can thus be obtained purely from the representation theory of the
iosp(d, 2/2) algebra.

1 introduction and main results

in recent work the question of the super-algebraisation of the hamiltonian brst-bfv
extended phase space quantisation for gauge systems has been examined[1, 2, 3, 4]. specif-
ically, following earlier indications along these lines in the literature[5], it has been claimed
that there are natural spacetime quantization superalgebras which possess representa-
tions precisely mirroring the brst-bfv construction in certain cases, namely relativis-
tic particle systems and generalisations thereof, for which the relevant spacetime super-
symmetries are the superconformal algebra osp(d, 2/2) and its inhomogeneous extension
[1, 2, 3], or the family d(2, 1; ) of exceptional superalgebras, in the 1 + 1-dimensional
case[4].

in a previous work on the scalar particle [1] the supersymmetry was realised using the
method of produced superalgebra representations. in the present work this programme is
continued with the examination of the covariant brst-bfv quantisation of the spinning
particle model via a spin representation of iosp(d, 2/2), and the sharpening of previous
work via a covariant tensor notation for this extended spacetime supersymmetry. our
specic results, to be elaborated in the remainder of the paper, are as follows. in section
2, a space of covariant spinor superelds carrying an appropriate spin representation of
iosp(d, 2/2) is introduced, and its structure studied. the generators jm n of osp(d, 2/2)
have orbital and spin components, associated respectively with standard conguration
space coordinates and dierentials x m , pm = m , and an extended (graded) cliord
algebra with generators n entailing both fermionic and bosonic oscillators. the mass
shell condition p  p  m2 = 0 factorizes, allowing the dirac condition     m = 0
to be covariantly imposed at the d + 2/2 - dimensional level, eecting a decomposition
of the representation space. at the same time, the dirac wavefunctions split into upper
and lower components, so that the iosp(d, 2/2) algebra is eectively realised on 2d/2-
dimensional dirac spinors (over xm , and subject to a certain dierential constraint on
p, deriving from the mass shell condition). full technical details of the construction are
given in section 2.

in section 3 a brst operator  is named as one of the nilpotent odd generators
of the homogeneous superalgebra (a super-boost acting between fermionic and light
cone directions), relative to a choice of ghost number operator within the sp(2) sec-
tor. correspondingly a gauge xing fermion f of opposite ghost number is identied (a
supertranslation generator), and physical hamiltonian h = {f , }. finally, the coho-
mology of  is constructed at arbitrary ghost number. it is found that the physical states
thus dened are precisely those wavefunctions which obey the conventional (d  1) + 1-
dimensional dirac equation, and moreover which have a xed degree of homogeneity in
the light cone coordinate p+. given that the p constraint already dictates the evolution
of the dirac spinors in the light cone time x = +x+, the analysis thus reveals that this
superalgebraisation of the brst-bfv quantisation yields the correct spin- 1
2 irreducible
representation of the poincare algebra in (d  1) + 1-dimensions, as carried on the space
of covariant solutions of the massive dirac equation.
as this construction has been obtained purely algebraically, without the use of a
physical model, it is nally the task of section 4 to establish that the standard hamiltonian
brst-bfv ansatz, applied to the spinning particle model[6, 5, 7, 8], does indeed give

rise to an identical state space structure. the only proviso on this statement turns out to
be that the models extended phase space should formally be modied by a contraction,
or  - limit [9] in order to identify the appropriate sector of the full phase space (for
details see section 4.2).

in conclusion, the import of our programme, exemplied by the present case study,
is an approach to covariant quantisation of models with gauge symmetries via a coho-
mological realisation of the appropriate space of irreducible representations of physical
states (in the case of particle models on at spacetime, the poincare algebra) through the
construction of the correct brst complex (in the present cases, as realised within the
covariant representations of the quantisation superalgebras osp(d, 2/2) and generalisa-
tions). further concluding remarks, and prospects for future work, are given in section
5.

2 covariant representations of iosp(d, 2/2)

2.1

introduction and notation

the iosp(d, 2/2) superalgebra is a generalisation of iso(d, 2). the supermetric m n we
shall use throughout is made up of three parts; the rst has block diagonal form with the
entries being the minkowski metric tensor of so(d, 1) with 1 occurring d times,

the second part is o diagonal and can be written

 = diag(1,1,1, . . . ,1).

ab = (cid:18) 0 1

1 0 (cid:19) ,

where a, b = , reecting a choice of light cone coordinates in two additional bosonic
dimensions, one spacelike and one timelike. the nal part corresponds to the grassmann
odd components and is the symplectic metric tensor

 =  = (cid:18) 0

1

1 0 (cid:19) .

here greek indices , , . . . take values 1, 2, whilst , , , . . . take values in the range
0, . . . , d1, whilst latin indicies a, b, c, . . . range over , , . . . , +,. the indices m, n, . . .
cover all values, and thus run over 0, . . . , d  1, +,, 1, 2. we also dene graded commu-
tator brackets as

[[am , bm ]] = am bn  [mn]bn am ,
{[am , bm ]} = am bn + [mn]bn am ,

where the convention for the [mn] sign factor is [mn] = (1)mn (extended to hm n
p i =
(1)mn+np as necessary). note that the grading factors are m, n = 0 for minkowski and
light cone indices , , . . . , and m, n = 1 for symplectic indices , , . . .. with these
index conventions the metric thus obeys m n = [mn]n m .

we dene jm n = [mn]jn m as the generators of the osp(d, 2/2) superalgebra, with

commutation relations as follows [10]

[[jm n , jp q]] = n qjm p +[np ]n p jm q[mn][mp ]m p jn q+[p q][mn][mq]m qjn p .
(1)
the homogeneous even subalgebra is so(d, 2) sp(2, ir) with so(d, 2) generated by j =
j, and sp(2, ir) by j = j. for clarity, we set j  k = k. likewise, the odd
generators will be denoted j  l or j  l. the inhomogeneous part i(d, 2/2)
consists of additional (super)translation generators pm satisfying

[[jm n , pl]] = ln pm  [mn]lm pn ,

the d + 2 even translations are p, p acting in the (d, 2) pseudo-euclidean space, and
the two odd nilpotent supertranslations are p  q.
we consider a class of covariant spinor supereld representations of iosp(d, 2/2) (com-
pare [1, 11]) acting on suitable spinor wavefunctions (xm ) over d + 2/2-dimensional
superspace, (b  f  s).

the osp(d, 2/2) generators can be more explicitly written

jm n = jlm n + jsm n ,

where the orbital part is dened

with

the spin part of (2) is

jlm n = xm n  [mn]xn m ,

n = pn =



x n = (cid:18) 
x  ,



x

,



x (cid:19) .

jsm n =

1
4

[[m , n ]] ,

(2)

(3)

(4)

where m , n are generalised dirac matrices. of course both jl and js fulll the
osp(d, 2/2) algebra.

the graded cliord algebra with generators n , acting on the space (b  f ), is

dened through

{[m , n ]} = m n + [mn]n m = 2[mn]m n ,

(5)

( if m 6= n then we can write m n = [mn]n m ). writing the  in compact form
as m = (, +, , )t , we have

 = 1    1,
 = 1    1,
 =   5  (1)z,

(6)

carries the graded cliord algebra (see below)

s denotes the superelds over d + 2/2-dimensional superspace (xm ) = (x, x, ), while b  f
b is the bosonic part which carries the representation of  (see below), while the fermionic f carries

the representation of the dirac algebra ,  and 5

where

0

1 0 (cid:19) ,
0 5 (cid:19) ,
(1)z is the parity operator for the s and is such that (1)z = , and (1)z =
, and is dened such that z  , 5 is dened such that 2

0  (cid:19) , + = 2(cid:18) 0 0
0 0 (cid:19) ,

5 = (cid:18) 5

5 = 5(= 1).

(7)

0

the denition of js leads to

4js = [[, ]] = 55(1)2z (cid:18) 1 0

0 1 (cid:19) + 55(1)2z (cid:18) 1 0

0 1 (cid:19) ,

= 5{, }(cid:18) 1 0

0 1 (cid:19) ;

moreoever {[, ]} = 2 and so we take

[, ] = 25.

(8)

(9)

in appendix a we provide a realisation of  (with 5 = 1) in terms of a pair of bosonic
oscillators with indenite metric.

from (1), (2.1) it is easy to establish the invariance of the square of the momentum

operator, namely

(cid:2)(cid:2)jm n , p rpr(cid:3)(cid:3) = (cid:0)r

= 0,

n pm  [mn]r

m pn(cid:1) + p rhm r

n i (rn pm  [mn]rm pn ) ,

(10)

thus the second order casimir is

p m pm  p p + qq

(11)

similarly we get the required generalisation of the pauli-lubanski operator

[jm n , w abcwcba] = 0, providing a fourth order casimir operator. for any vector
operator va we have

[jm n , va] = am vn  [mn]an vm ,
and similarly for any tensor operator vab, vabc, for example

(12)

[jm n , vabc] = am vn bc  [mn]an vm bc +hm a

n i (bm van c  [mn]bn vam c)

+hm a

n ihm b

n i (cm vabn  [mn]cn vabm ) .

from this we can calculate

[jm n , v abcvcba] = adbecf [jm n , vdef vcba] = 0.

if we dene vabc = wabc = pajbc + hbc

a i pcjab + hba

c i pbjca we get the required

identity.

(13)

(14)

2.2 dirac condition and reduced realisation of iosp(d, 2/2) super-

algebra

in order to project out irreducible representations of the full superalgebra, we require the
mass shell condition (klein-gordon equation): in representation terms, a requirement for
reducibility of the iosp(d, 2/2) representation.

however, using the cliord algebra just dened we have (cid:2)(cid:2)jm n , lpl(cid:3)(cid:3) = 0 and so we

can covariantly impose the stronger dirac condition,

(cid:0)p m m n p n  m2(cid:1)  = 0.

(15)

(16)

0 = (cid:0)p m m n p n  m2(cid:1) ,

= (cid:0)p m m + m(cid:1)(cid:0)p m m  m(cid:1) ,

i.e. , taking for example the positive root,

(cid:0)p m m  m(cid:1)  = 0.

we now construct the explicit forms of the generators jm n of iosp(d, 2/2) within this

decomposition of the full space. expanding the sum in (16) gives

(cid:0)p + +p+ + p + q  m(cid:1)  = 0,

or, in the explicit form, writing  as a two component array  = (cid:18) 2 (cid:19), gives
 [p +  (1)z5q + m] (cid:19)(cid:18) 2 (cid:19) = 0.

(cid:18) p +  (1)z5q  m

2p

2p+

from this, we get the rather useful expression

 = 

1

2p+

(p +  (1)z5q  m) ,

(17)

and so p can be written

p = 

1

2p+

(p +  (1)z5q + m)(p +  (1)z5q  m).

(18)

simplifying this equation yields

p = 
= 

1

2p+ (cid:0)p 2 + qq5  m2(cid:1) ,
2p+ (cid:0)p 2 + qq5  m2(cid:1) ,

1

(19)

which we shall later use as the hamiltonian. this equation is basically the klein-gordon
equation (see equation (15)) of the bfv quantised spinning relativistic particle model
which will carry the representation.

we are now in a position to explicitly determine the generators of osp(d, 2/2). we
show below the process for calculating j, and then state without proof all other terms,
with the understanding that the same process is repeated for each:
we have j = jl
js

= xp  xp and
1
2

+ js
=

, where jl

[[, ]] =

5(1)z (cid:19)(cid:18) 0 2
0 (cid:19) ,
(cid:19) ,

0

0
5(1)z

0

= (cid:18) 0

0

12

and so

j = (cid:18) xp  xp

5(1)z
= (cid:18) (xp  xp) + 5(1)z

(xp  xp)2

xp + xp (cid:19)(cid:18) 2 (cid:19) ,

(cid:19) .

12

0

substituting in from equation (17) gives

2p+ (cid:0)5(1)z  p +  5p  5(1)zm(cid:1) .

the remaining generators are:
j = xp  xp  ,
j = xp  xp  5
4 [, ], j+ = x+p  xp+,
j+ = x+p  xp+,
j+ = xp+  x+p  1
2,

j = xp  xp + 5
j = xp + xp + 5

2 ,

4 {, } ,

where we have dened

5(1)z

5

.

from the above denition we can easily show that [, ] =  1
[, ]. the non-zero
commutation relations between  and the remaining operators for iosp(d, 2/2) can be
calculated and are:

{, } = (cid:26)(cid:20)5(1)z

[x, p] =  ,
[x, p] = p 1

[, p] = p 1

[x, p+] = 1,
[x, p] = p 1

(29)

and

{5, } =  5
[x, ] =  5

2p+

{, } = p
,
, {x, } =  5

2p+

p+

[x, ] =

p+

p+

,
.

(28)

in summary, the realisation of iosp(d, 2/2) that we use is formulated in terms of the
operators x , p = 
 , , , and
x+ =  i, p = h, p+, x. the non-zero commutation relations amongst these variables
are

x , , 5, together with x  = , p = q = 

and

(30)
note in the above that x+ and p are no longer canonically conjugate when acting on
the  part of the supereld.

{, } = 25,

[, ] = 25.

we have now calculated the complete set of non-zero commutation relations between
the operators x m , pn , m , 5 and have shown that they do indeed provide the correct
realisation of iosp(d, 2/2) on the  superelds. remarkably, precisely these operators
will emerge as the raw material in the extended bfv-brst hamiltonian quantisation of
the relativistic spinning particle model (section 4 below). however, the algebraic setting
already provides the means to complete the cohomological construction of physical states,
as we now show.

3 physical states

the physical states of a system can be determined by looking at the action of the brst
operator  and the ghost number operator ngh upon arbitrary states , . as is well
known[9], the physical states obey the equations

 = 0,  6= , and ngh = ,

for some eigenvalue , where  is the brst operator, and ngh is the ghost number.
therefore in order to determine the physical states we shall x  and ngh, and determine
their actions upon an arbitrary spinor-valued supereld .
take two c-number sp(2) spinors ,  with the following relations

 = 0 = ,
 = 1 = .

an example of two such spinors is

 =

1

2 (cid:18) 1

1 (cid:19) ,  =

2 (cid:18) 1

1 (cid:19) .

below in the supereld expansions we use

(31)

(33)

the rst of these pairs of denitions leads to

and therefore

.

choose the brst operator and gauge xing operators as

 = l,
f = p,

and consistently the ghost number operator ngh  k satises

[ngh, ] = , and [ngh,f ] = f ,

as required.

3.1 action of ghost number operator

note that in our case

ngh = 11k11 + 12k12 + 22k22 + 21k21 = 

1
2

(k11  k22).

(34)

(35)

k can be written k = k s
 where the two parts denote the bosonic and
fermionic (spin and orbital) contributions respectively. this leads to ngh having two
parts as well;

 + k l

(36)

(37)

the corresponding anti-brst operator is  = l

as seen in appendix a, we can write a series expansion of an arbitrary spinor supereld
 over (x, x, ) in an occupation number basis in the indenite metric space acted on
by ,

(m,n)|m, ni =

thus using equations (41) and (42),

(m,n) = a(m,n) + (m,n)



 (m,n)



+ b(m,n).

(41)

(42)

(43)

in what follows, the occupation number labels in the bosonic space will be suppressed,
whereas the structure of the explicit supereld expansion will be needed. thus for example

a  pm,n=0 a(m,n). note

in appendix a the diagonalisation of ()() is carried out explicitly in the occupation
number basis {|m, ni}. below we assume that suitable eigenstates can be found, and
explore the consequences for the cohomology of the brst operator at generic ghost
number .

3.2 action of brst operator
the brst charge is dened above as  = l and from section 2.2 we can write

l = p  x


  .

(50)

we have previously (22) dened  and can write it as  = 1
where d5 = 5(  p  m) is the dirac operator multiplied by 5. consequently

2p+ (cid:0)d5(1)z + 5 p(cid:1),

 =

2p+

(d5(1)z + 5 p),

.

the second part of equation (51) can be further expanded as follows

which uses the identity  = ( + ). therefore

2p+

2p+

and so we can write

in a similar fashion we can expand the fermionic part of l as follows

but

therefore

p = 1

qq = qq = ( + )





 ,

= 2







,

p = 1

2p+ (cid:18)(p 2  m2) + 2






(cid:19) .

the brst operator can thus be written

finally, we identify the physical states at generic ghost number , arising from the
cohomology of , as the spinors , with the following properties. from (68), the  obey the
usual massive dirac equation. from (19),(55), the p constraint dictates the dependence
of supereld components on light cone time  = x, as p = /x. finally, interpreting
(75), (76) in the p+-representation (the fourier transform of the x+-representation, i.e.
x  x + = /p+), the  are homogeneous functions of p+ of degree (+1 1
45 + ).
thus the  are essentially only functions over (d  1) + 1-dimensional minkowski space.
for example, in the case 5 = 1,  = 3/4 (which implies  = 0), and using (a.16), we
nd that the physical states have the following explicit form

| i = (x) [|0, 0i  |1, 1i + |2, 2i + . . . + (1)m|m, mi + . . .] ,

4 brst-bfv quantisation of the spinning particle

and iosp(d, 2/2) structure

as is well known [9, 13], the bfv canonical quantisation of constrained hamiltonian
systems [14, 15, 16] uses an extended phase space description in which, to each rst class
constraint a, a pair of conjugate ghost variables (of grassmann parity opposite to that
of the constraint) is introduced. here we follow this procedure for the spinning relativistic
particle. although our notation is adapted to the massive case, m > 0, as would follow
from the second order action corresponding to extremisation of the proper length of the
particle world line, an analysis of the fundamental hamiltonian description of the rst
order action[9] leads to an equivalent picture (with an additional mass parameter  6= 0
supplanting m in appropriate equations, and permitting m  0 as a smooth limit).
in either case, for the scalar or spinning particle the primary rst class constraint is
the mass-shell condition 1 = (p 2  m2), where p 2 = p p . including the lagrange
multiplier  as an additional dynamical variable leads to a secondary constraint, reect-
ing conservation of its conjugate momentum . the quantum formulation should be
consistent with the equations of motion and gauge xing at the classical level, as such
two restrictions are necessary so as to arrive at the particle quantisation corresponding
with the superalgebraic prescription of section 2. firstly, we choose below to work in the
class [17, 18, 19, 20]  = 0; moreover, we take gauge xing only to be with respect to
gauge transformations in one of the connected components of the group, i.e. either the
identity class, or the orientation reversing class characterised by  = i + f   . thus 
will be quantised on the half line (say ir+), and the system is not modular invariant until
the two distinctly oriented sectors (particle and anti-particle) are combined [9]. secondly,

2 = 3/2 is the correct conformal dimension for a spinor eld (see [12])

1 =  as the other secondary rst class constraint (rather than (2)

we take (2)
1 = 
used in the standard construction) . finally, the spinning particle system also entails a
second, grassman odd rst class constraint 2 = p  +m5 ( = 1), together with its
associated rst class constraint (2)
2 , the conjugate momentum of the corresponding
lagrange multiplier 2 (which is also grassmann odd).

2 = (2)

4.1 bfv extended state space and wavefunctions

the bfv extended phase space [9] for the brst quantisation of the spinning relativistic
particle is therefore taken to comprise the following canonical variables:

x( ), p( ),  , 5, ( ), ( ), 2( ), 2( ), a(i), a(i), a, i = 1, 2.

(78)

2

x( ), p( ) are grassmann even whilst  , 5 are grassmann odd variables,  is the
grassmann even lagrange multiplier corresponding to the even rst class constraint 1,
 is the momentum conjugate to  (which forms the constraint (2)
1 ), 2 is the odd
lagrange multipler corresponding to the grassmann odd rst class constraint 2, and
2 = (2)
(2)
is its conjugate momentum. 1(1), 1(1) and 1(2), 1(2) are the grassmann odd
conjugate pairs of ghosts corresponding to the constraints 1 and (2)
respectively, while
1
2(1), 2(1) and 2(2), 2(2) are the grassmann even conjugate pairs of ghosts corresponding
to the constraints 2 and (2)
respectively. we proceed directly to the quantised version by
2
introducing the schrodinger representation. we introduce operators x , p corresponding
to the coordinates x, p, acting on suitable sets of wavefunctions over x, and on the half
line  > 0. the hermitian ghosts a(i), b(j) (a pair of bc systems) are represented as usual
either on a 4-dimensional indenite inner product space |i, ,  = , or here, in order
to match with section 2, in terms of suitable grassmann variables acting on superelds.
the non zero commutation relations amongst (78) read (repeated in full for clarity):

[x, p] = , {, } =  2

5

, {5, 5} = 25,

[, ] = 1, {2, 2} = 1,
[2(i), 2(j)] = i
j

{1(i), 1(j)} = i
j,

i, j = 1, 2,

from which the algebra of constraints follows:

{2, 2} = 251 {1, 2} = {1, 1} = 0.
the hermiticity conditions imposed on the above operators read

 = ,

x = x, p  = p,
5 = 5,
0 = 0,
 = , 2 = 2,

(a(i)) = a(i),

(a(i)) = (1)a+1(a(i)), a = 1, 2.

with the remainder invariant. at the same time we relabel the co-ordinates p+ = 1
and x = . at the quantum level the corresponding brst operator ( = 1(1)1 +
1(2)(2)

1 + 2(1)2 + 2(2)(2)

it is also convenient to dene [5] the operators , q,  and  ( = 1, 2) by

1,2 = 12 (cid:0)2(2)  2(2)(cid:1) ,

1,2 = 12 (cid:0)2(1)  2(1)(cid:1) ,

which obey the relations

{q, x} =  and [, ] = .

kthe criteria for the construction and nilpotency of the corresponding anti-brst operator  have

been given in [21]

in terms of these variables we attain the following simple forms for the brst, gauge
xing and hamiltonian operators.

4.2 limiting procedure for the brst operator

it is now necessary to reconcile the development of sections 2 and 3, in which the identical
raw material for construction of the brst operator, gauge xing function and hence
physical states, appears purely algebraically (compare equations (29),(30),(28) with (79))
except for the absence of the 2(2), 2(2) even ghosts and thus the 1, 2 oscillators. in [5], a
somewhat heuristic argument was provided to justify the restriction to the vacuum of the
latter oscillators. here instead we shall use what is known as the limiting procedure
[9] applied throughout on the a = 2 label of the bfv phase space variables (if we also
apply it to the a = 1 label we recover the fadeev-popov reduced phase space quantisation
scheme). the exposition will closely follow that of [9].

consider instead of (85) the gauge xing fermion

f = 

1
2

1(1) +

1


(2  0

2)2(2) + 22(1),

(92)

where  is arbitrary, real and grassmann even and 0
the same properties as 2. the hamiltonian is thus given by

2 is some given function of time with

hef f = [[f , ]] =

+2(2)2(1) + 22(1)1(1) + 22.

2)(2)

2 +

2(2)2(2)

(93)

the equations of motion for the bfv phase space variables can be easily obtained for
a = [[a, hef f ]]. we now change to new variables
the above h by implementing as usual
2, 2(2) such that 2 =  2 and 2(2) =  2(2) and subsitute these into hef f ,  and ngh,
the equations of motion and the action related to hef f . having done that we take the
limit   0, in particular the brst and ghost number operators then become

 = 1(1)1 + 1(2)(2)

1 + 2(1)2 +

ngh =

2

xi=1

1(i)1(i) + 2(1)2(2) 

1
2

1
2

(2(1))21(1),

(94)

(95)

while the equations of motion for 2, 2, 2(2) and 2(2) (which are the ones that are aected
by the limiting procedure) now become:

(2  0

2) = 0, 2 = 2  2(1)1(1), 2(2) = 0, 2(2) = 2(2).

(96)

solving these equations and taking 0
2 = 0, we nd that equations (94) and (95) remain
as they are whilst hef f = h. thus we have succeeded in squeezing out the 2(2) pair of
even ghosts together with the odd lagrange multiplier 2. moreover the hamiltonian in
equation (85), obtained from the admissible gauge xing fermion given in equation (84),
is recovered.

finally, and most importantly, the canonical transformation in equations (86), (87)
is not aected by this procedure, as can easily be observed. thus whether we apply
the canonical transformations before the limiting procedure or after does not matter.
consequently via equations (86), (87) equation (94) becomes

 =

1

2 (cid:16): (2)

1

: (q1 + q2) + (1 + 2)h + (1 + 2)(2 + q)(cid:17) ,

(97)

the forms (85) and (97) can now be shown to be identical to the previously given alge-

1

braically dened expressions for these quantities ((19), (35). the raw material (29),(30),(28)
also appears in this construction, as can be easily observed by (79), and by identifying
p+ = 1, x =: (2)
:,  = 2 + q and the brst operator  = l. moreover,
the realisation of iosp(d, 2/2) can be done as in (21), (23).
in particular, the evalua-
tion of the brst cohomology performed in section 3 above, gives precisely the correct
identication of physical state wavefunctions for the spinning particle model of this sec-
tion, provided that we represent  by (1)z to account for the correct action on the
supereld and the correct commutation relations of iosp(d, 2/2). also, the constant 5
appearing in (19) can also be introduced in the third equation of (91) to account for
5 = 1, which will eventually appear in the factorisation of p leading to the dirac
equation.

5 conclusions

the present work, via the positive results claimed here for the test case of the spinning
particle, provides conrmation of our programme of establishing the roots of covariant
quantisation of relativistic particle systems, in the brst complex associated with rep-
resentations of classes of extended spacetime supersymmetries. similar examples under
study are the d(2, 1; ) particle in 1 + 1 dimensions[4], the higher spin-s case and the
relation to bargmann-wigner equations, as well as considerations of how the method can
be extended to, say, superstring or superparticle cases, for which a covariant approach
has so far been problematical[22]. the general approach[2, 3] is a classication of quanti-
sation superalgebras in diverse dimensions, whose representation theory will implement
the covariant quantisation, in the spirit of the above example, of the appropriate classical
phase space models of systems with gauge symmetries.

conformal (super)symmetry has long been of interest as a probable higher symmetry
underlying particle interactions, no more so than in the light of recent interpretations of

compactications of higher dimensional supergravities [23, 24]. the present application
is of particular interest in that the traditional descent from d + 2 to d dimensions -
via a projective conformal space [12] - is here implemented not on the cone (massless
irreps), but for the massive (super)hyperboloid. the present work can also be seen as an
elaboration of the method of conformalisation [25], and as a version of two time physics
[26, 27, 28]. beyond the dirac equation and higher spin generalisations, it will also be
possible to investigate the algebraic brst-bfv complex associated with indecomposable
representations[29, 30] (for example where the vector-scalar (super) special conformal
generators are represented as nilpotent matrices).

finally, it is important to point out that the present study has not attempted to settle
the key question of the appropriate inner products for the covariant wavefunctions. such
further structure is under study, and can be expected to be important for the realisation
of modular invariance in the models. further applications, such as the identication of
the correct supermultiplets to which the scalar and dirac propagators belong, will provide
the rudiments of a theory of quantised elds at the osp(d, 2/2) level.
