abstract

we study the expectation value of (the product) of the one-particle projector(s) in
the reduced matrix model and matrix quantum mechanics in general. this quantity is
given by the nonabelian berry phase: we discuss the relevance of this with regard to
the spacetime structure. the case of the u sp matrix model is examined from this re-
spect. generalizing our previous work, we carry out the complete computation of this
quantity which takes into account both the nature of the degeneracy of the fermions
and the presence of the spacetime points belonging to the antisymmetric representa-
tion. we nd the singularities as those of the su (2) yang monopole connection as well
as the pointlike singularities in 9 + 1 dimensions coming from its su (8) generaliza-
tion. the former type of singularities, which extend to four of the directions lying in
the antisymmetric representations, may be regarded as seeds of our four dimensional
spacetime structure and is not shared by the iib matrix model. from a mathematical
viewpoint, these connections can be generalizable to arbitrary odd space dimensions
due to the nontrivial nature of the eigenbundle and the cliord module structure.

introduction

continuuing studies in matrix models for superstrings and m theory [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in-
dicate that we are in a stage of obtaining a renewed understanding of old notions such as
compactication and spacetime distribution in this constructive framework. these physical
quantities are obtained after integrations of matrices and are no longer xed input param-
eters or backgrounds. another feature common to these models is that the actions contain
terms bilinear in fermions. this is, of course, related to the d brane in the rr sector as the
absence of these bilinears imply the absence of the rr sector of the model 2.

the major objective of this paper is to enlighten the spacetime structure and the presence
of solitonic objects revealed by the fermionic integrations of the matrix models. these are
represented by the behavior of the spacetime points, ( or d0 branes in [1]), which are
the eigenvalue distributions or the diagonal elements of the bosonic matrices. the eective
dynamics of the spacetime points is obtained by carrying out the integrations of the remaining
degrees of freedom: we will carry out the half of them represented by the fermions. our
interest, therefore, lies in a collection of individual fermionic eigenmodes obtained from
the fermionic part ( denoted generically by sf ermion) of the action upon diagonalization.
an object which, we nd, plays a role of revealing singularities as those of the bosonic
parameters ( in particular, those of the spacetime points) is an expectation value of the
one-particle projector belonging to each of the fermionic eigenmodes. (see eq. (2.27)).

we see that this expectation value of the projector is generically given by the nonabelian
berry phase [6, 7]. in matrix models of superstrings and m theory, this result oers spacetime
interpretation: this is because the parameter space, where the connection one-form lives, is
that of the spacetime points or d0 branes. an interesting case that we study as our major
example is the usp reduced matrix model [4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11]. we will carry out an explicit
evaluation of the nonabelian berry phase factor for dierent types of the projectors. our
computation leads us to the su(2) lie algebra valued connection one-form known as the
yang monopole [12] in ve spatial dimensions and its su(8) generalization in nine spatial
dimensions. this latter one, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in physics context
before. the existence of the nontrivial eigenbundles based on the rst quantized hamiltonian
with gamma matrices and the orthogonal projection operators ensures that these nonabelian
connections are straightforwardly generalized to arbitrary odd spatial dimensions.

the conclusion derived from our computation in the context of the usp matrix model

2 the reduced matrix model provides a constructive denition to the green-schwarz superstrings in the
schild gauge. a subsector of the state space which contains fermion bilinears is able to see the rr sector of
the superstrings.

2

is that there exist singularities extending to four of the directions of the spacetime points
which lie in the antisymmetric representation. these singularities are represented by the
yang monopole. in addition, we nd pointlike singularities in 9 + 1 dimensions which are
represented by its su(8) generalization. the former type of singularities may be regarded
as being responsible for our four dimensional spacetime structure and is not shared by the
iib matrix model 3. it is noteworthy that the requirement of having 8 + 8 supersymmetries
brings us such possibility.

before moving to the next section, let us mention the procedure to formulate the expec-
tation value of the one-particle projector in the reduced matrix models. (see eq. (2.27)). to
say things short, these are obtained from short time/innite temperature limit of the matrix
quantum mechanical system, where a path in the parameter space can be readily introduced.
this is equivalent to imposing a periodicity with period r on one of the original bosonic
matrices, say, v0 and to letting this period go to innity in the end. machinery to deal with
these situations has been developed in [13]. we mention here the calculation of [14, 15],
which is similar in spirit to ours. there the exact computation of the partition function of
the iib matrix model [2] has been carried out as the limit of innite temperature of the path
integral of the bfss [1] quantum mechanical model. this is the same limiting procedure as
ours although we will measure the one-particle projector instead of unity. (see eq. (2.35). )

in the next section, we describe the formulation and the procedure of our computation
indicated above after a brief review on the usp(2k) matrix model. in section iii, we de-
compose the fermionic part of the action into the bases of the adjoint, antisymmetric and
fundamental representations appropriate to our computation. this amounts to diagonalizing
it for the case that the bosonic matrices are diagonal. unlike our previous studies [8, 9], we
do not set the spacetime points lying in the antisymmetric representation to zero. this turns
out to improve substantially our picture of the spacetime formation suggested by the model.
in section iv, we compute the nonabelian berry phase for three types of actions obtained
in section iii. the connection one-forms we nd are the nonabelian su(2) yang monopole
in ve dimensions and its su(8) generalization to nine dimensions. the degenerate state
space originating from the spinorial space is responsible for making these nonabelian gauge
elds. in section v, we summarize the spacetime picture emerging from our computation.
in section vi, we discuss the generalization of the yang monopole in arbitrary odd space
dimensions by clarifying the eigenbundle structure associated with the nonabelian berry
connection. detail of the basis decomposition in section iii is collected in the appendix.
some of the papers on fermionic and bosonic integrations of matrix models are listed in [16].

3 the signature of the four directions which the yang monopole is extended to is euclidean in the model.
we have nothing to say on how to make the signature minkowskiian and on the extension of the spacetime
in the v0 direction.

ii. nonabelian berry phase and matrix models

the goal of this section is to establish that the expectation value of the one-particle
projector of a fermionic eigenmode is given by the nonabelian berry phase. this is true
in general, in particular, in matrix models (both matrix quantum mechanics and reduced
matrix models) containing fermion bilinears. besides the examples we discuss below, our
discussion here will apply to a variety of models obtained, for instance, by a truncation from
supersymmetric eld theories in various dimensions [17]. as we will occasionally refer to the
case of the usp(2k) matrix model the major example of our paper already in this section,
we will present the brief review of this model in the rst subsection and defer the major
discussion to the second subsection.

a.

some preliminaries

to begin with, the usp lie algebra is dened by

usp(2k)  {a  u(2k)| taf + f a = 0} ,

and the antisymmetirc representation is dened by

asym(2k)  {a  u(2k)| taf  f a = 0} .

here f is an antisymmetric matrix with nonzero determinant and can be chosen as

it is easy to recognize

f = 


0 
0 1k
 .
1k

u(2k) = usp(2k)  asym(2k) .

a representaion of eq. (2.1) in accordance with the choice ( eq. (2.3) ) is

let us recall here some aspects of the reduced usp(2k) matrix model which are relevant
to our discussion in what follows. the denition, the criteria and the rationale leading to
the model as descending from typei the superstrings are ellaborated fully in ref.[4, 5]. we
will therefore not repeat these here.

let  be a projection operator acting on 2k2k hermitean matrices. for the ten bosonic
matrices,  projects the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 components onto the adjoint representation and the
5, 6, 8, 9 components onto the antisymmetric representation:

vm = (v, vn) ,

v  usp(2k),
vn  asym(2k)

 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 ,

(2.7)

n = 5, 6, 8, 9 .

as for the fermions,  splits the thirty two component majorana-weyl spinor (sixteen real
degrees of freedom) in 9 + 1 dimensions into an eight component spinor belonging to the
adjoint representation and another eight component spinor belonging to the antisymmetric
representation:

 = adj + asym ,

(2.8)

where

adj 

asym 

t
(1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0)

,

t
(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2)

.

(2.9)

modulo labelling the indices, these projections are determined by the requirement of having
8 + 8 supersymmetries. finally, we add degrees of freedom correponding to an open string
degrees of freedom while preserving supersymmetry. this amounts to adding nf = 16 of
the hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation in the 4d language. we display these
degrees of freedom by the complex 2nf dimensional vectors ( see the appendix a of [10])

let us turn to the action of the model. it is represented as

is the closed string sector of the model. we denote the fermionic part by

the remainder of the action

consists of the parts which depend on the fundamental hypermultiplet. we only spell out

complete discussion, see [10].

b. one-particle projector and nonabelian berry phase

let us rst imagine diagonalizing some action sf ermion which is bilinear in fermions. in the
example of the last subsection, this is given by the fermionic part of the action

sf ermion  sm w + sgf + sy ukawa .

(2.21)

6

in general, sf ermion can be written as

sf ermion = x x

here

as mentioned in the introduction, we would like to evaluate an expectation value of the one-
particle projector

which are (cid:16), , q

written as

(2.23)

(2.24)

can be

(2.25)

the expectation value is dened through the integrations over the fermionic variables of
the model. a formula that we nd in the end (eq. (2.35) ) and the one we use (eq. (2.38) )
in the subsequent sections are obtained from the short time/innite temperature limit of the
corresponding quantum mechanics, in which the path dependence can be easily introduced.
in order to argue more directly that this quantity can be dened in the reduced models, we
start with imposing a periodicity constraint on one of the directions, say, v0:

svms 1 = vm + r1m.0 .

(2.26)

the size of the matrices is necessarily innite dimensional in order to permit solutions to
eq. (2.26). each matrix divides into an innite number of blocks. the shift operator s acts
on each block and moves it diagonally by one in our situation.

let us introduce

hh p 



ii  lim

rz [d] [dz] eis(,z;z ,z )hz  | p 



| z i .

(2.27)

here s(,z;z ,z ) and hz  | p | z i are the grassmann coordinate representation of
sf ermion and that of p 
respectively. we have indicated the end point constraints and the
path  in eq. (2.27). these will become clearer shortly. we will also consider



hh yi

p 



ii ,

(2.28)

7

where i is a subset of all eigenmodes and the case of our interest is the one in which this
subset is over the eigenmodes belonging to the positive eigenvalues. this choice is motivated
by the dirac sea lling.

in principle, one can diagonalize eq. (2.21) for general vm and q. we will, however,

restrict ourselves to the case

vm = xm = diagonal

, q = 0 .

(2.29)

explicit diagonalization of eq. (2.21) to the form of eq. (2.22) in this case will be carried out
in the next section.

let us convert eq. (2.27) into the fourier transformed variables and this helps us under-

stand the limiting procedure in eq. (2.27) better.

(2.34)

(2.35)

reducing this expression into that of the rst quantized quantum mechanics, we nd that
this quantity is nothing but the time evolution of the -th degenerate eigenfunction 
 . (
note that this 
is the same as the one appearing in the original expression eq. (2.25). )

the generic expression is known to consist of the energy dependent dynamical phase and
4 an innite normalization (0) is involved in the relation sf ermi  lf ermion, which is related to the

problem of the scaling limit. we will simply absorb this in the coupling g2.

the nonabelian berry phase [6, 7]. this latter phase factor is given by the path-ordered
exponential of the loop integral of the connection one-form a (xm ). we obtain

here

a (xm ) = i

(2.36)

(2.37)

and the nonabelian gauge eld a (xm ) originates from the degenerate eigenfunction.

finally letting r large or the time period  short, we nd

(2.38)

separating the phase of topological origin from the dynamical phase 5.

iii. complete decomposition of the fermionic part of the action

in this section, we will show how to decompose the fermionic part of the action. the
diagonal part of the fermions has no contribution to the action in the present treatment.
we only need to focus on the o-diagonal part. after expanding by the bases of lie algebra
generators of usp(2k), the fermionic part of the action nally can be classied into three
types.

a.

the case of the iib matrix model

let us consider the fermionic part of the action of iib reduced matrix model:

s =

1
2

trm [xm , ]

.

(3.1)

the matrices are all u(2k) lie algebra valued. here, for brevity, we ignore the coupling and
the minus sign in the action. these will be put back in the next section.

5 with regard to the last footnote, we have adopted here the normalization of the energies/eigenvalues

as quantum mechanics.

using the set of bases dened by

(eab)ij  aibj

,

(3.3)

we can write the bases of the lie algebra generators of u(n), which are hermitian matrices,
as

ha = ea,a  ea+1,a+1
sa,b = ea,b + eb,a

(a < b) ,

(a = 1,   , n  1) ,

ta,b = i(ea,b  eb,a)

(a < b) .

here

ha =

let us decompose  into the diagonal part  and the o-diagonal part :

the component expansion of  reads

now the action depends only on s and t :

b.

the case of the u sp(2k) matrix model

along the same line, the fermionic action in usp(2k) matrix model can be decomposed.
here we pay most of our attention to the closed string sector of usp(2k) model. the
sector which the fundamental representation belongs to has been discussed in [9], and will
be reviewed briey at the end of this subsection. the fermionic part of the action takes the
same form as eq. (3.1). but now the matrix fermion  is decomposed into the adjoint and
the antisymmetric representation as is described in eqs. (2.8), (2.9). as for xm ,

xm = diag(x1

m ,   , xk

m , (x1

m ),   , (xk

m )) ,

where the  is a projection:

 : x  x ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 ,
xn 

xn , n = 5, 6, 8, 9 .

the generators of usp(2k) excluding the cartan subalgebras are

sab  sa+k,b+k ,
sa,b+k + sb,a+k ,

sa,a+k ,

tab + ta+k,b+k , a < b  {1, 2,   , k}
ta,b+k + tb,a+k , a < b  {1, 2,   , k}
ta,a+k , a = 1, 2,   , k

while the generators of asym(2k) excluding the diagonal ones are

sab + sa+k,b+k ,

sa,b+k  sb,a+k ,

tab  ta+k,b+k , a < b  {1, 2,   , k}
ta,b+k  tb,a+k , a < b  {1, 2,   , k} .

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

the fermions adj and asym are expanded respectively by the bases eq. (3.15) and eq. (3.16).

after some algebraic manipulation which we leave in the appendix, we nd that the

fermionic action of usp(2k) reduced model is expressed in terms of three types of actions

(3.20)

we call li,lii and liii type i, type ii and type iii action respectively. see the appendix
for detail of our notation.

it is obvious that only components from the diagonal blocks d contribute to type i
action, while only components from o contribute to type ii action. as for type iii action,
only components from od contribute and they are all in the adjoint representation. we
will nd that the contribution from the fermions in the fundamental representation has the
same form as type iii action. we see that the part of the adjoint fermions and all of the
antisymmetric fermions form majorana-weyl fermions while the remainder of the adjoint
fermions decouple from the spacetime points lying in the antisymmetric representation. we
indicate below the parts of the matrix degrees of freedom of the fermion  constributing to
li, lii and liii by , , and  respectively .

(3.21)

apart from the fermions in the closed string sector, we also have the fermions belonging
to the fundamental representation in eqs. (2.16) and (2.17). the action, up to the prefactor,
reads

sf = q

(q  f (x4 + ix7 + m) q + h.c.) .

(3.22)

as is already discussed in [8, 9], this action does not depend on xn n = 5, 6, 8, 9 and is in
fact type iii;

sf = xa,f,liii (cid:16)q(f )a; xa

  m(f ),4(cid:17) .

see [8, 9] for more detail. the fermionic part of the action reads

sf ermion  s + sf .

iv. computation of nonabelian berry phase

we now proceed to the computation of the nonabelian berry phase. eqs. (4.17) (4.47)

are our results.

a.

type iii case

the generic type iii action liii in the last section do not really depend on the spacetime
points xn belonging to the antisymmetric representation. let us rst compute the nonabelian
berry phase for the hamiltonian of this type. putting back the prefactor discarded in the
last section, we obtain the corresponding rst quantized hamiltonian:

h =

1

g2 x=1,2,3,4,7

x ,

(4.1)

where s are the ve dimensional gamma matrices obeying the cliord algebra. we take
the following representation:

1 = 1  3 , 2 = 2  3 , 3 = 3  3 ,
4 = 12  1 , 7 = 12  2 .

(4.2)

where i are the pauli matrices.

the eigenvalues of eq. (4.1) are | x |

g2 with | x | s x=1,2,3,4,7

x2
 and each one is doubly

degenerate. we focus on the two dimensional subspace of the one-particle states which
belongs to the positive eigenvalue. the nonabelian berry connection obtained will be su(2)
lie algebra valued. the eigenstates can be obtained with the help of projection operators,
which are dened by

p 

(14  y) ,

where

x
| x |
parametrize s4. these projection operators satisfy

y

2 = p

p 

+ = p+

hp = |x|

g2 p .

(4.3)

(4.4)

eq. (4.17) is the form we have obtained in [9]. we now discuss our renewed understand-
ing. we will show below that, by a further change of coordinates, the above non-abelian
connection a can be brought exactly to the form of the bpst instanton conguration [18].
we are in the ve dimensional space with coordinates x1, x2, x3, x4, x7, and in this coordi-
nate system the berry connection seems to have a prefactor depending on x3. as is seen in
[12], however, the connection is independent of the radius if we work in the polar coordinate
system. this means that we can consider the problem on s4. from this point of view alone,
a is a nontrivial su(2) bundle over s4 with second chern number 1.
in other words,
it should be the bpst self-dual or anti-selfdual(asd) instanton connection with instanton
number 1. to show this explicitly, we make the following series of change of coordinates:
rst change to the polar coordinate system on s4 and, via the stereographic projection,
change to the orthogonal coordinate system on r4 where the connection is made manifestly
the asd su(2) connection. the transformations which realize these are found to be

yi =

2zi

1 + z2

,

i = 1, 2, 4, 7 ,

y3 =

where {zi} 6 parameterize r4, and

in the same way, the berry connection corresponding to the minus eigenvalue can be evalu-
ated. it is a selfdual instanton with k = 1.

for the sake of our discussion, it is more appropriate to regard this as pointlike nonabelian
singularity located at the origin of ve space dimensions. in fact, this is what is sometimes
called yang monopole [12] or an su(2) monopole in ve-dimensional at space or four-
it has a nontrivial chern number on s4 and its topological
dimensional spherical space.
stability is summarized by 3(su(2)) = z as is the case for the bpst instanton.

this time, the projection operator acts on the weyl projected sixteen dimensional space. the
gamma matrices are understood to act on this space and are regarded as 16  16 matrices.
with the help of this projection operator, the orthogonal eigenvectors can be constructed.
in the case of the positive eigenvalue, the eigenvectors are

here the second line is well-dened around the north pole while the third line is well-dened
around the south pole.

we focus on the eigenspace well dened around the north pole with the positive eigen-
value. the eigenspace forms an eight dimensional vector space. the nonabelian berry phase
is su(8) lie algebra valued one form and is given by

due to the orthogonality of dierent eigenvectors. by the same reason, the last line in

conclude that only the last term of o with i, j 6= 3 contributes to the nonabelian berry
phase.

let us see if this eigenbundle is nontrivial. the nontrivial su(8) bundle on s8 is characterized
by the seventh homotopy group

7(su(8)) = z .

(4.53)

this leads us to compute the fourth chern number using eq. (4.52) derived from our eigen-
bundle:

c4(p ) = z c4(p ) = (

4! z t r(f 4) = 1 .

our eigenbundle is in fact nontrivial and has the fourth chern number 1.

v. spacetime picture emerging from our computation

let us recall the generic formula (eq. (2.38) ) stated in the end of section two:

hh p 



ii = p exp(cid:20)ii a (xm )(cid:21)

.

19

the results from our computation in the last section are summarized as eqs. (4.17), (4.23):

for the generic type i,ii action li,ii, giving the su(8) monopole. putting these together,
we state that the expectation value of the projector of a fermionic eigenmode is given by
the path-ordered exponential of the integration of the connnection one-form and that this
factor in the case of usp matrix model is controlled by the su(2) or the su(8) nonabelian
monopole singularity sitting at the origin of the parameter space xm . in the case of the
su(8) monopole, it is a pointlike singularity in nine dimensions while in the case of the
su(2) yang monopole it is a singularity which does not depend on the four antisymmetric
directions. the latter one, viewed as a singularity in the entire space, is not pointlike
but is actually a four dimensionally extended object. the emergence of these interesting
objects, albeit being aposteriori, justies the study of this expectation value rather than of
the fermionic part of the partition function.

the matrix models in general contain many species of fermions, which couple to dier-
ent spacetime points or d0 branes. they provide a collection of nonabelian berry phases
rather than just one. with this respect, it is more appropriate to consider the manybody
counterpart indicated in section two (eq. (2.28) ):

where the subset i+ of all eigenmodes is taken over the eigenmodes belonging to the positive
eigenvalues.

actually, sf ermion  s + sf of the usp matrix model contains many terms consisting of
the generic li,ii type action as well as the generic liii type action. listing the parameters

which they depend on, we obtain from eq. (3.17)

k = 1,   6. and the last two cases
of eq. (5.3) and the case of eq. (5.4) ( sum over a and f ) by xa(k )
. in the case where more
than two spacetime points collide, we will obtain an enhanced symmetry which supports a
nonabelian monopole.

(5.5)

in the context of a matrix model for unied theory of superstrings, measuring eq. (2.28),
or eq. (2.38) will provide means to examine spacetime formation suggested by the model.

21

the presence of colliding singularities of spacetime points in general means a dominant
probability to such congurations. as we have said, there are two varieties of singularities we
have exhibited in this paper. the singularities of the su(8) monopoles appear to be evenly
distributed in all directions as long as the o-diagonal bosonic integrations are ignored. this
type is present both in the iib matrix model and the usp matrix model. the singularities
of the su(2) monopoles appear to be a string soliton of four dimensional extension present
in the usp matrix model and is not shared by the iib matrix model. it is tempting to think
that the four dimensional structure is formed by a collection of the su(2) monopoles. we
put the spacetime picture emerging from contributions of various eigenmodes of the usp
matrix model as a table.

(5.6)

as for the v0 direction, we have used this to parametrize the path in the remaining nine
directions. the price we have to pay is that we have nothing to say on the distributions of
the spacetime points in this direction and this is closely related to the problem of the scaling
limit. further progress and understanding of the spacetime formation of matrix models
require overcoming this point.

vi. generalization of the yang monopole to odd dimensions

in section iv, we have discussed the two kinds of nonabelian berry connections which
have led us to the nontrivial su(2) and su(8) vector bundles over the parameter space. the
tools which have brought us to these bundles are the rst quantized hamiltonian with gamma
matrices and the orthgonal projection operators. letting aside the physics context, these
are certainly generalizable to arbitrary odd dimensions. in fact, the relevant mathematical
discussion of such eigenbundle can be found for instance in [20].

let  : rm+1  end(c k) be a linear map. we assume

(x)2 = |x|2  ik and

(x) = (x) .

let

(x) = xii

.

(6.1)

(6.2)

22

such i satisfy the cliord commutation rules:

ij + ji = 2ij

.

(6.3)

that is, i are in fact gamma matrices. it is said that i give a cli(rm+1) module structure
to c k.

let

|x| = 1 .
be an orthogonal projection onto the 1 eigenspace of (x). let

 = {(x, )  sm  c k : (x) = }

(1  (x)) ,

for

be the corresponding eigenbundle. clearly

sm  c k = 

 .

+m 

(6.4)

(6.5)

(6.6)

it is obvious that the orthogonal projection dened here is exactly the projection operator
dened from our rst quantized hamiltonian. the berry connection is just the connection
on eigenbundle 
. it has been shown that the chern number of this eigenbundle is

+ or 

zs2j

cj(

+) = ij2jt r(0    2j) .

(6.7)

from this formula on the chern number, we see that when m is odd, t r(0    m) vanishes
and the eigenbundle is trivial. when m is even, we nd

t r(0    m) = 2

m
2

m

2 (i)

.

(6.8)

therefore the m
2 -th chern number should be 1. we have proven this explcitly by deriving
the su(2) berry connection on r5 ( the m = 4 case), and the su(8) berry connection on
r9 (the m = 8 case), and the curvature two-forms associated with them. the u(1) berry
connection on r3 (the m = 2 case) is well known. the berry connection on r7 (the m = 6
case) may be related to some conguration in the reduced matrix model.

having formulated the eigenbundles associated with the nonabelian berry phase in arbi-
trary odd dimensions, we can safely state that the connnection one form and the curvatuire
two form on rm+1 are given by

a =

1

2 (1 + z2)

(zidzj  zjdzi)ij

and

(1 + z2)2 dzi  dzjij
respectively. here zi are orthogonal coordinates on rm.

appendix

in this appendix, we give some details of the derivation of the component expression of the
action (eq. (3.17). let us rst expand adj and asym by the generators stated respectively
in eq. (3.15) and in eq. (3.16):

(a.1)

(a.2)

let us explain our notation more carefully. adj is expanded by eq. (3.15) which consists
of three sets of generators: the rst set of generators ( the rst line of eq. (3.15) ) is in
the o-diagonal elements of the diagonal blocks ; the second set of generators ( the second
line of eq. (3.15) ) is in the o-diagonal elements of o-diagonal blocks; and the third set
of generators (the third line in eq. (3.15)) is in the diagonal elements of the o-diagonal
blocks. we, therefore, distinguish these generators by d( the diagonal blocks), o( o-
diagonal elements of the o-diagonal blocks) and od( diagonal elements in the o-diagonal
blocks) respectively. in each set of the generators, there are contributions from both the real
part s and the purely imaginary part t . we distinguish these by the superscript s and t .

as for asym, the bases are o type and d type only. in the above expansion, ( eqs. (a.1),
(a.2) ), the component elds are specied by the superscript specifying the species of the

generators and the subscript specifying the representation. for example, (cid:16)ods

component elds of the adjoint fermions which correspond to the expansion coecients of
the s type od generators. the same is true for the other components.

introduce three types of actions consisting of fermion bilinears:

li(, ; xm , ym )  (cid:16) + (cid:17) m (xm  ym ) ( + )

26

(cid:16)  (cid:17) m ((xm )  (ym )) (  ) ,

lii(, ; xm , ym )  (cid:16) + (cid:17) m (xm  (ym )) ( + ))

(cid:16)  (cid:17) m ((xm )  ym ) (  ) ,

liii(; xm )  x .

(a.7)

(a.8)

(a.9)

notice the relation

0m (xm  ym )  0hm ((xm )  (ym ))h = 20m (xm  ym ) ,

(a.10)

with

h  diag(1, 1, 1, 1,1,1,1,1, 1, 1, 1, 1,1,1,1,1) .

(a.11)

the above three types are simplied to be

li  2(cid:16) + (cid:17) m (xm  ym ) ( + )
lii  2(cid:16) + (cid:17) m (xm  (ym )) ( + )
liii  x .

,

,

(a.12)

(a.13)

(a.14)

it is easy to see that the action s can be written in terms of li,lii, and liii, as is seen in
the text ( eq. (3.17)).
