abstract

we analyze the integrability properties of models dened on the symmetric
space su (2)/u (1) in 3 + 1 dimensions, using a recently proposed approach for
integrable theories in any dimension. we point out the key ingredients for a the-
ory to possess an innite number of local conservation laws, and discuss classes of
models with such property. we propose a 3+1-dimensional, relativistic invariant
eld theory possessing a toroidal soliton solution carrying a unit of topological
charge given by the hopf map. construction of the action is guided by the re-
quirement that the energy of static conguration should be scale invariant. the
solution is constructed exactly. the model possesses an innite number of local
conserved currents. the method is also applied to the skyrme-faddeev model,
and integrable submodels are proposed.

1 introduction

in this paper we consider scalar eld theories in 3 + 1 dimensions, dened on s2, or
equivalently on the symmetric space su(2)/u(1). one of the motivations to study such
theories is that some of them present topological solitons. the requirement of nite
energy for static congurations imposes, in general, that the elds should be constant
at spatial innity. consequently, for such purpose space can be taken to be s3, and the
solutions dene a mapping s3  s2. the topological charges carried by the solitons
are then determined by a hopf map. that diers from the case of magnetic monopoles,
for instance, where the charges are winding numbers of the map s2  s2. the hopf
index is given by the linking number of the pre images of a given pair of points of s2.
as a consequence, the solitons tend to have string like congurations, and those with
charge unity to have a toroidal shape.

conventional wisdom of two dimensional soliton physics holds that the existence
of solitons is linked to the notion of integrability. the reasoning is that the high
degree of symmetries underlying the innite set of conserved quantities accounts for
the conspiracy among the degrees of freedom, necessary for the appearance of solitons.
we give indications here that also in the setup of higher dimensional integrable models
the solitons appear in theories with innite number of conserved quantities.

we analyze the integrability properties of those scalar theories using the approach
of [1], which generalizes the concept of zero curvature in two dimensions to theories
dened in a space-time of any dimension. those ideas are reviewed in section 2. in
section 3 we dene the models we are interested in by presenting their zero curvature
representation. then we discuss the conditions the model has to satisfy to contain an
innite number of local conserved currents. in section 4 we study some examples of such
integrable theories. one of the important ingredients to have soliton solutions, is that
the energy should be stable under scaling of the space variables (derricks theorem). in
section 4.1 we introduce a model where the energy for static congurations is invariant
under such scalings. we then construct the exact solution for a soliton carrying one
unity of topological charge. in section 4.2 we discuss the integrability of the skyrme-
faddeev model [7], and propose a submodel of it which possesses an innite number
of conserved currents.

2 integrability in any dimension

as we said, we shall analyze the integrability properties of the models considered in this
paper using the approach of [1]. the main idea there is to generalize the zero curvature
condition in two dimensions guided by the fact that it embodies conservation laws.
indeed, the atness condition for the lax operators a implies that its path ordered
integral is path independent, as long as the end point are kept xed. for a closed path
that leads to a gauss type law and so, conserved quantities. therefore, the central
idea in [1] to bring such concepts to higher dimensions, is to introduce quantities
integrated over hypersurfaces and to nd the conditions for them to be independent of
deformations of the hypersurfaces which keep their boundaries xed. such an approach
certainly leads to conservation laws in a manner very similar to the two dimensional
case. however, the main problem of that is how to introduce non-linear zero curvatures
keeping things as local as possible. the way out is to introduce connections to allow
for parallel transport.

the zero curvature obtained in [1] is in general non local but there are interesting
conditions under which it becomes local. the structures underlying those conditions
involve a lie algebra g and a representation r of it. then one introduces the non-
semisimple lie algebra gr as

[ta , tb] = f c

abtc

[ta , pi] = pjrji (ta)

[pi , pj] = 0

(2.1)

where ta constitute a basis of g and pi a basis for the abelian ideal p (representation
space). the fact that r is a matrix representation, i.e.

[r (ta) , r (tb)] = r ([ta , tb])

(2.2)

follows from jacobi identities.

in (3 + 1) dimensions, which is the case of interest here, one then introduces a
connection a belonging to g and a rank 3 antisymmetric tensor b belonging to p ,
i.e.

a = aa

ta ,

b = bi

pi

then the local zero curvature conditions are given by

db  db + db  db = 0

2

(2.3)

(2.4)

and

where we have introduced the covariant derivative

f  [ + a,  + a] = 0

d    +[a ,  ]

introducing the dual of b as

one can write (2.4) as

b 

1
3!

 b

d b = 0

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

the relations (2.5) and (2.8) constitute the local generalization to higher dimensions of
the zero curvature condition in two dimensions. they lead to local conservation laws.
indeed, since the connection a is at it can be written as

and consequently (2.8) implies that the currents

a = w w 1

are conserved:

j  w 1 b w

 j  = 0

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

the zero curvature conditions (2.4) and (2.5) are invariant under the gauge trans-

formations

and

a  g a g1  g g1
b  g b g1

a  a
b  b + d + d + d

(2.12)

(2.13)

in (2.12) g is an element of the group obtained by exponentiating the lie algebra g.
the transformations (2.13) are symmetries of (2.4) and (2.5) as a consequence of the
fact that the connection a is at, i.e. [d , d] = 0. in addition, the parameters 
take values in the abelian ideal p .

3

the currents (2.10) are invariant under the transformations (2.12), while under

(2.13) they transform as

j  j +  (cid:16)w 1  w(cid:17)

(2.14)

the transformations (2.12) and (2.13) do not commute and their algebra is isomor-

phic to the non-semisimple algebra gr introduced in (2.1).

3 integrable models on su(2)/u(1)

the models we shall be considering involve scalar elds living on the two dimensional
sphere s2, and we will denote them as n = (n1, n2, n3), with n2 = 1. alternatively,
one can use the stereographic projection of s2 and work with two unconstrained scalar
elds, which we shall choose to constitute a complex scalar eld u related to n by

n =

1

1+ | u |2 (cid:16)u + u,i (u  u) ,| u |2 1(cid:17)

(3.1)

the sphere s2 can be mapped in a one-to-one manner into the symmetric space
su(2)/u(1) and we shall explore that fact to construct the local zero curvature con-
ditions (2.4) and (2.5)1. the u(1) is the subgroup invariant under the involutive
automorphism of su(2)

 (t3) = t3

 (t) = t

where t3, t are the generators of su(2) satisfying2

[t3 , t] =  t ,

[t+ , t] = 2 t3

the automorphism (3.2) is inner and given by

 (t )  eit3 t eit3

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

the elements of su(2)/u(1) can be parametrized by the variable x (g)  g (g)1,
g  su(2), since x (g) = x (gk) with k  u(1). in addition one has that  (x) = x1.
1the sphere s 2 is dieomorphic to so(3)/so(2), and so(3)  su (2)/z2. the elements of the
subgroup u (1) in su (2)/u (1) are given by g () = exp (it3). therefore, g (0) = 1l and g (2) = 1l,
and such u (1) has twice as many elements as so(2). in fact, so(2)  u (1)/z2, and so the points of
s 2 and su (2)/u (1) are in one-to-one correspondence.

2actually, these are the generators of sl(2). the generators of su (2) are ti, i = 1, 2, 3 with

t = 1

2 (t1  it2).

4

we then choose the group element w in (2.9) to be of the form of the variable x (g),
i.e.

where  = ln(1+ | u |2). in the dening (spinor) representation of su(2) one has

w  eiut+ et3 eiut

r(1/2) (w ) =

1

q1+ | u |2

iu

iu

1 


indeed, one can check that  (w ) = w 1, using in (3.4) that

r(1/2)(cid:16)eit3(cid:17) = 


we then introduce the potentials

(3.9)

where k is a functional of the elds u and u and their derivatives.
in addition,
p (1)
1 stand for the states of eigenvalues 1 of t3 in the triplet representation of su(2).
according, to (2.1) they are generators of the abelian subalgebra p of gr. here we give
the commutation relations for any spin-j representation (m = j,j + 1, . . . , j  1, j)
(3.10)

[t3 , p (j)

[t , p (j)

m ] = m p (j)

m ] = qj(j + 1)  m(m  1) p (j)

m1

[p (j)

m , p (j )

m ] = 0

(3.11)

(3.12)

obviously, the zero curvature relation (2.5) is trivially satised because we have
chosen a of the pure gauge form. so, it does not impose any condition on the elds
u and u.

requiring, that

im (ku) = 0

one obtains that the zero curvature condition (2.8) implies that

(cid:16)1+ | u |2(cid:17) k  2uku = 0

5

(3.13)

(3.14)

together with its complex conjugate equation.

according to (2.10) and (2.11) one gets three conserved currents corresponding to

three states of the triplet representation. they are given by

j (1)

xm=1

j (1,m)


p (1)

(3.15)

with

(1+ | u |2)2

j (1,1)




= j (1,1)



(3.16)

 p (1)

1  k

notice that the condition (3.13) implies that the term in the direction of p (1)
vanishes, i.e. h u t+ + u t , k p (1)
1 i = 0. therefore, the equations
of motion (3.14) are determined only by the way that b transforms under the u(1)
in fact, b contains two irreducible representations of
subgroup generated by t3.
u(1) which are the singlets p (1)
1 of charges 1. that means that if we change the
representation of su(2) where b lives, we do not change the equations of motion if
b still transforms under the same two singlets of the u(1) subgroup. what can happen
is that the commutator of the t part of a does not commute with b anymore, and
then we get some additional equations which should be considered as constraints on
the model. consequently, we would be dealing with submodels of the original theory.
see ref. [2] for a detailed discussion on that.

one way of implementing these ideas is as follows. any integer spin-j representation
of su(2) possesses a charge zero singlet of the u(1) generated by t3, which is p (j)
0 .
therefore, if one considers representations of su(2) which are tensor products of these
representations, one obtains several singlets of u(1) transforming like p (1)
1 , which are
given by tensor products of p (j)
0 . for instance one has

1 with copies of p (j)

h 1  t3 + t3  1 , p (j )

0  p (j)

1 i = (cid:16)p (j )

0  p (j)
1(cid:17)

(3.17)

therefore, for the case of the tensor product of n integer spin representations, one

introduces the potentials

(3.19)

(3.20)

the zero curvature condition (2.5) for these potentials is still trivially satised
is of the pure gauge form. the condition (2.8) can be split in two

because a(j1...jn)
terms:



 b(j1...jn)



+h a(j1...jn,3)



, b(j1...jn)



i = h a(j1...jn,)



, b(j1...jn)



i

(3.21)

the l.h.s. of such equation vanishes as a consequence of the equations of motion (3.14).

we now have, using (3.13), that

h a(j1...jn,)



in addition

i = i (cid:16)u p (jl)

1 + u p (jl)

(3.23)

now, let us analyze the r.h.s. of (3.21). consider the terms containing commutators

of a(j1...jn,)



with p (jl)

0

and p (jm)

0

(l < m)). then one gets, using (3.23), the terms

1 + u p (jl)

therefore, taking into account (3.13), one observes that if one imposes the con-

straint

k u = 0

(3.24)

those two terms cancel. the same constraint cancels the terms involving the commu-
tator (3.22). therefore, the r.h.s. of (3.21) vanishes.

consequently, the zero curvature conditions (2.5) and (2.8) for the potentials (3.18)
lead to the equations of motion (3.14) and the constraint (3.24). and so, they lead to
the submodel dened by equations

k = 0

k u = 0

(3.25)

7

according to (2.10) and (2.11) one obtains the conserved currents

(3.26)

therefore, one gets qn
l=1 (2jl + 1) currents. however, since n and jl can be any positive
integer number, such submodel contains an innity of conserved currents. all such
currents are linear in k and k
, with the coecients being functionals of u and u.

notice that any current of the form

j  k

g
u  k



g
u

(3.27)

with g being any functional of u and u only (no derivatives), are conserved as a
consequence of (3.13) and (3.25). we have checked that for the case where all jls are
equal to 1, the currents (3.26) are of the form (3.27) [2].

4 examples

the methods discussed above can be used to construct integrable models with an innite
number of conserved currents in a space-time of any dimension. the example of cp 1
in (2 + 1) was discussed in [1], and corresponds to the choice k  u. examples
involving other symmetric spaces (or homogeneous spaces) were also considered in
[2, 3, 4].

a particular class of models can be constructed using the quantity

k = (uu) u  (u)2 u

since it automatically satises

in addition one has that

ku = 0

im (ku) = 0

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

therefore, if f is any real functional of u, u and their derivatives, it follows that

the choice

k  f (u) k

8

(4.4)

satises (3.13) and (3.24), and consequently leads to a class of models dened by the
equations of motion (see (3.25))

and possessing an innite number of local conserved currents given by (3.26)-(3.27).

the corresponding equations of motion are

with the potentials being given by (3.18) and

(4.10)

indeed, such k satises (3.13) and (3.24) as a consequence of (4.2) and (4.3).

consequently, the model (4.8) is integrable (or solvable) in the sense that it pos-

sesses an innite number of conserved currents given by (3.26)-(3.27).

we are interested in constructing exact static nite energy solutions with non van-
ishing topological charges. the nite energy requirement imposes that the eld n

9

should be constant at spatial innity. therefore, for such purpose one can consider the
three dimensional space as an s3 where the spatial innity is identied with the north
pole. the relevant topological invariant is given by the hopf map s3  s2, and the
topological charge is

qh 

1

42 z ijkhijakd3x ; hij = iaj  jai = abcnainbjnc

(4.11)

one of the main diculties of constructing such type of solutions comes from scaling
instabilities in the energy [5, 6, 7]. the choice of the lagrangean density (4.8) is made
to avoid such problems. indeed, the energy for static congurations is given by

e  z d3x 00 = 8

3

4 z d3x

(kiiu)
(1+ | u |2)3

(4.12)

with i = 1, 2, 3, and  being the canonical energy-momentum tensor. under a
rescaling xi  xi, one has ki  3ki, and so energy is scale invariant.

the soliton we found is constructed using the rational map approach [8]. it has
a hopf charge qh = 1 and corresponds to a spherically symmetric hedgehog skyrme
eld dened in terms of a rational map r : s2  s2 and a radial prole function f (r)
which enter as follows in the expression for the complex eld u

u =

where

in what follows we choose

g(r)  cotanf (r)

r(, ) = tan(/2) exp(i)

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

which can be identied via stereographic projection with a point z on the sphere dened
by polar coordinates (, ). with the choice of (4.15) the complex eld u becomes:

u = 

ei

sin()

(cos()  ig(r))

;

1 + |u|2 = (1 + g2(r))/ sin2()

(4.16)

for which the hopf charge qh is equal to one [9].

plugging the ansatz (4.16) back into equations of motion (4.9) we nd that it is a

solution of equations of motion for

(1 + g2(r))/r2 = g 2(r)

;

g(r) = (r1  r)/2

(4.17)

10

correspondingly, the soliton solutions of equations of motion are given by

u = 

ei

sin() (cid:18)cos() 

i

2 (cid:18)1

r  r(cid:19)(cid:19)

according to (4.17), we can take the prole function f (r) to be

f (r) = arctan(cid:16)2r/(r2  1)(cid:17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

which is monotonically decreasing function with the boundary conditions f (0) =  and
f () = 0.

we also nd that the soliton energy is given by

e = z (cid:16)h 2

d3x = (8  43)3/42z
and since r r2dr(r4 + 2r2 + 1)3/2 = /16 we obtain

ij(cid:17)3/4

e = 8(23/4)2 = 132.78

(r4 + 2r2 + 1)3/2

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

(4.23)

alternatively, one can rewrite the soliton solutions (4.18) as a composite of the hopf
map :

u = i

4  i3
1  i2

together with the stereographic map : r3  s3 of degree 1:
r2  1
r2 + 1

, i = 1, 2, 3 ; 4 =

r2 + 1

i =

2xi

eq. (4.18) is reproduced when making use of the spherical representation x1 + ix2 =
r sin  exp(i), x3 = r cos . we recognize in (4.22) the soliton solution of reference
of [6], where expression of the same form as in (4.22) was found as a solution to the
equations of motion of the model:

l = 0(cid:18)0

1
4

(n)2(cid:19)3/2

(4.24)

note, that the scaling property of this model is such that it circumvents the derricks
theorem in the similar manner to the model dened by (4.8).

equations of motion of (4.24) dier from that of (4.8). however, when the additional

constraint

(u)2 = 0

(4.25)

is imposed then equations of motion for both models take an identical and simplied
form of

 (h (u) u) = 0

(4.26)

11

where

h (u)

in the case of soliton solutions given by (4.16) or (4.18) the condition (4.25) is au-
tomatically satised, which explains why (4.18) is a common solution for both these
models.

(4.27)

4.2 the skyrme-faddeev model

(4.28)

where h was dened in (4.6), 0 = 1 determines the signature of the minkowski
metric (see (4.8)), and  is a lagrange multiplier.

the corresponding equations of motion, in terms of the complex eld u introduced

in (3.1), are

and k is dened in (4.1).

one of the main properties of such theory is that the two terms compensate the
scaling instabilities in the energy that each term would present if considered separate.
indeed, the energy for static congurations is given by

where  is the angle between the vectors u1 and u2, and so e1 and e2 are positive
denite.

by rescaling the space variables as xi  xi, one has

expanding around  = 1 (  1  )

e () = (e1 + e2) + (e1  e2)  + e2 2 + o(cid:16)3(cid:17)

one observes that it is necessary to have

to get stable congurations.

e1 = e2

however, no solution with non trivial topological charge has been explicitly found
for this model. the existence of soliton solutions has been corroborated by numerical
calculations using variational methods to nd congurations which minimize the energy
[7, 9].

we now discuss the integrability properties of the skyrme-faddeev model. notice

that

therefore, if one makes the correspondence

im (lu) = 0

k  l

(4.36)

(4.37)

one notices that (3.13) is satised, and the skyrme-faddeev model admits a zero cur-
vature representation with the potentials being given by (3.8) and (3.9).

the conserved currents are given by (3.16), and they correspond to the three
noether currents associated to the invariance of the model under the o(3) symme-
try. the skyrme-faddeev model, however, does not admit an innite number of con-
served currents, obtainable through the procedures described in section 3, because the
condition (3.24) is not satised, since

lu = m2 (u)2

(4.38)

however, the submodel obtained by imposing the constraint3 (4.25), does possess
an innite number of conserved currents given by (3.26) (with the replacement (4.37)).
then the equations of motion (4.29) become

 (f (u) u) = 0

(4.39)

3one could also impose m2 = 0 to obtain an integrable submodel. however, the static solutions
of such theory would present, in 3 + 1 dimensions, scaling instabilities in the energy. to avoid such
instabilities one would have to consider such submodel in 4 + 1 dimensions.

(4.40)

since such submodel possesses an innite number of local conserved currents, we
believe that it is easier to be solved than the full skyrme-faddeev model. we are now
investigating the solitons it may have.
