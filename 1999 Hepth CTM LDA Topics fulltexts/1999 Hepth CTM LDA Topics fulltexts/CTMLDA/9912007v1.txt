abstract

we present the analysis of all possible shortenings which occur for composite gauge
invariant conformal primary superelds in su (2, 2/n ) invariant gauge theories.
these primaries have top-spin range n
2  jmax < n with jmax = j1 + j2, (j1, j2)
being the sl(2,c) quantum numbers of the highest spin component of the super-
eld.
in harmonic superspace, analytic and chiral superelds give jmax = n
2 series while
intermediate shortenings correspond to fusion of chiral with analytic in n = 2, or
analytic with dierent analytic structures in n = 3, 4.
in the ads/cft language shortenings of uirs correspond to all possible bps
conditions on bulk states.
an application of this analysis to multitrace operators, corresponding to multipar-
ticle supergravity states, is spelled out.

1 introduction

the recent interplay between supergravity in ads5 and superconformal su(n )
yangmills theories in the large n limit [1, 2, 3] has lead to a deeper investi-
gation of su(2, 2/n) superconformal algebras and their uirs both on bulk
states and on supereld boundary operators.

a complete identication of highest weight uirs was given in refs. [4, 5]

for n = 1 and further extended to any n by dobrev and petkova [6].
since yangmills theories are built only with a nite number of supersingle-
ton elds, having jmax  1 (these are the basic multiplets of the 4 dimensional
superconformal theory) only a subclass of all possible uirs are realized in
qft, nevertheless the variety of such representations is still rather rich and
many dierent shortenings may occur.

short multiplets have an important aspect in the ads/cf t correspon-
dence because they have protected conformal dimensions and therefore
allow a reliable comparison between quantities computed in the bulk versus
quantities derived in the cf t4 [7, 8].

a particular example of such a phenomenon are the kk masses of bulk
states which belong to short su(2, 2/n) uirs [9]. for such states in the
n = 4 case, corresponding to iib supergravity on ads5s5 [10], it is possible
to give, at least for large n , an exact operator realization in terms of 4d
shortened superconformal elds [11, 12].

another example of such a correspondence has been worked out in the
literature [13, 14] by comparing iib supergravity on ads5  t11 [15] and a
specic su(2, 2/1) invariant su(n )su(n ) yangmills theory constructed
by klebanov and witten [16].

already in this simple n = 1 example it was realized that n = 1 chiral
superelds are only a particular case of short representations. indeed it was
shown [14] that semishort multiplets occur in the kk spectrum of iib super-
gravity on ads5 t11, with the very subtle implication that some square root
formulae for the conformal dimensions, giving in general irrational numbers,
become perfect squares for particular relations of the quantum numbers of
the bulk states, precisely corresponding to semi-shortening conditions, which
imply rational conformal dimensions.

for n > 1 scf t4s the shortening and semi-shortening is even richer
because maximal shortening (which means half of the total number of s)
can occur either with chiral superelds or with grassmann (g)analytic
superelds [17]-[22].

1

this may happen because a new class of uirs occur for n  2 which

have no n = 1 analogue (class c) in the classication given below [6]).

the n = 2 hypermultiplets and the n = 3, 4 yangmills eld strength
multiplets (supersingletons) belong precisely to this class of uirs together
with an innite tower of recurrences.

a crucial ingredient to understand the occurrence of dierent shortenings
for composite superconformal primaries in n = 2, 3, 4 theories is the use
of harmonic superspaces [17],[19],[21] with harmonic variables on su (n )
u (1)n 1 ,
the coset given by non-abelian rsymmetry modded by its cartan
i.e.
subalgebra (the maximal torus).

analytic superelds (in harmonic superspace) correspond to a new class
of n  2 uirs which have no n = 1 analogue. moreover for n > 2, since
the above coset has many complex variables, dierent types of analyticity
may occur and this allows for an even richer structure of shortenings when
composites of superelds with dierent ganalytic structure are considered.

the present paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we review the unitarity bounds of highest weight uirs of

su(2, 2/n) (n  2) and of p su(2, 2/4) for n = 4.

in section 3 we consider extended superspaces with harmonic variables in
su (n )
u (1)n 1 for n = 2, 3, 4 in subsections 1, 2, 3 respectively. ganalytic proper-
ties of supersingleton representations (the would-be massless elds on the
boundary) are explained together with dierent analytic structures occurring
for n = 2, 3, 4.
note that although n = 3 yangmills is believed to be the same of n = 4,
certainly this is not the case for the bulk theory since n = 6 supergravity on
ads5 is not the same as n = 8 [23].
this can be understood from the fact that there is a ring of operators which
reproduces the n = 6 supergravity states [8, 24].
another fact is that n = 3 harmonic superspace provides an o-shell formu-
lation of maximally supersymmetric yangmills theory which is not available
in its own n = 4 superspace [19, 20].
the three subsections are written in an independent way, so that the reader
not interested can skip any of them.

in section 4 we consider an application to multitrace operators in n = 4
yangmills theory by showing that all such operators have some supercon-
formal irreducible components which are short with dierent types of short-

2

enings.
in the ads5/cf t4 correspondence they should correspond to multiparticle
bps supergravity states preserving respectively 1
8 supersymmetries.
the rst two types of states occur in the double-trace operators while the
third type starts to occur for triple-trace operators.

in section 5 a summary of our results is presented. some technical mate-
rial related to properties of harmonic superspace is collected in an appendix.

2 highest weight uirs of su (2, 2/n ): a re-

view

the su(2, 2/n) superalgebra has a 5-grading decomposition [25, 26, 27]:

ln = l1 + l

1

2 + l0 + l 1

2 + l1

(2.1)

with respect to its maximal compact subalgebra l0 = su(2)  su(2) 
u(1)  u(n).

a highest weight state is dened as

l 1

2 | >= l1| >= 0 .

(2.2)

a highest weight uir representation is specied by a uir rep. of  with
respect to l0. the eigenvalues of the two u(1) respectively denote e0 (the
ads energy) and the u(1) r-charge.

the compact basis is suitable to discuss bulk states, i.e. uirs on
ads5.
in the ads/cft correspondence the cft operators are naturally
described in the non-compact basis[27], in which the highest weight state
is mapped into a spacetime supereld whose lowest component (x, )|x==0
is a irreducible representation of sl(2,c)  o(1, 1)  u(n).

in this correspondence the (j1, j2) quantum numbers denote a sl(2,c)
irreducible representation and e0   denotes the dilatational weight (con-
formal dimension).

a spacetime supereld, whose lowest component corresponds to a high-
est weight state, is called a primary (or quasi-primary) conformal super-
eld. needless to say that su(2, 2/n) will have supercasimir operators
which are at least 3 + n = rank(su(2, 2)  u(n)) (3 + n  1 for n = 4
if we consider the superalgebra p su(2, 2/4) [5] as we will do in the present
paper).

3

in what follows it will be convenient to dene poincare supercasimirs
for the su(n) part of the superconformal algebra in order to study the
irreducible content of the superelds in harmonic superspace (hss). the
other quantum number properties will be straightforward.

since a uir of su(2, 2/n) is denoted by its highest weight state, we will
mainly denote such rep. [4] by d(, j1, j2; r; a1, . . . , an 1), where a1, . . . , an 1
are the dynkin labels of su(n). for a given n we call a1 = a, a2 = b,
a3 = c, . . .. here  is the conformal dimension of (x = 0,  = 0) and
(j1, j2, r) its sl(2,c) and u(1) r-symmetry quantum numbers.

in the next sections we will only consider the cases with j1 = j2 = 0 and

supersingletons with top spin j  1.

the quantum numbers of the highest weight state are subjected to some
unitarity bounds [6], whose thresholds correspond to the several possible
shortenings of uirs of su(2, 2/n).

when the maximal possible number of bounds are fullled then the uir
becomes extrashort, in the sense that it gives the least possible number of
states for a given set of unitarity bounds.

examples of such extrashort uirs are the supersingletons and the
bulk massless reps., which in the cft language correspond to boundary
massless elds and to conserved current operators respectively [11, 28].

supersingletons [29] are called ultrashort because their degrees of free-

dom are not enough to correspond to particle states on ads bulk.

on these uirs space-time derivative constraints are imposed on the con-
formal primary operators. for all other shortenings no space-time derivative
constraints are imposed but rather a relation between dierent  components
of the conformal supereld at hand.

the highest weight uirs of the superconformal algebras su(2, 2/n) fall
in three categories, depending on the quantum numbers of the highest weight
state

d(, j1, j2; r, m1, . . . , mn 1)

(2.3)

where  and (j1, j2) label the dimension and the sl(2,c) spin respectively,
r is the u(1) rsymmetry and (m1, . . . , mn 1) the young tableaux (yt)

labels of su(n) ( m = pn 1

let us dene the quantities:

k=1 mk).

x(j, r, 2m1  2

m
n

) = 2 + 2j + r + 2m1 

2m
n

4

y (r, 2m1  2

m
n

) = r + 2m1 

2m
n

(2.4)

then we have [6]:

 a)   x(j2, r, 2m1  2 m

n )  x(j1, r, 2 m

n ), (or j2  j1, r  r,

2m1  2 m

n  2 m

n ), for j1j2  0.

 b)  = y (r, 2m1  2 m

n )  x(j1, r, 2 m

n ), (or j2  j1, r  r,

2m1  2 m

n  2 m

n ), for j1j2 = 0, j1 = j.

 c)  = m1, r = 2 m

n  m1, j1 = j2 = 0

massless representations in the ads5 bulk correspond to the treshold
in a) when  = 2 + j1 + j2, r = j1 = j2, in b) when  = r = 2 + j and in
c) when  = m1 = 2.

in these cases the cft supereld is such that current components of

the form j12s1 , 1 2s2

, with j = 2 + s1 + s2, are conserved:

1 1j12s1 , 1 2s2

= 0

(2.5)

we will call the supereld in question current supereld. the supersin-
gletons (massless conformal elds) occur in b) for  = r = 1 + j and in
c) for  = m1 = 1. these representations are ultrashort and the eld
components o12s obey the equatons of motion:

1 1o12s = 0

( o = 0 for s = 0).

(2.6)

it is a general fact of ads reps. that massless bulk uirs are contained

in the product of two singletons [29].

in the scft language this means that a current supereld is bilinear

in the supersingleton superelds as one can easily check.

other shortenings, which do not involve space-time constraints on com-
ponent elds, will be called short multiplets or short superelds where
the shortening has a ring structure, namely it is preserved by multiplication
of superelds.

as we will see in the next section, this corresponds to the concept of

chirality and grassmann analyticity in harmonic superspace.
shortenings of this type occur in b) and c).

finally, there are other types of shortenings which are not of this type;
we will call them semishort. they can appear in a) b) c) and typically

5

correspond to superelds which satisfy second or higher order constraints
in covariant derivatives (second order constraints dene the so-called linear
superelds). in all the above cases no space-time constraints on component
elds are implied.

here we will consider the cases n = 2, 3, 4; the n = 1 case has been

treated elsewhere [4, 30, 31].

we shall use dynkin labels (dl) [a1, . . . , an1] for su(n), which are re-

lated to the yt labels (m1, . . . , mn1) as follows:

mi =

ni

xk=1

ak ,

i = 1, . . . , n  1 .

(2.7)

a crucial ingredient in our analysis will be the use of harmonic superspace

(x, , u), with harmonic variables u parametrizing the coset su(n)/u(1)n 1.

we will separately consider the cases n = 2, 3, 4 and for n = 4 we will
restrict the analysis to the p su(2, 2/4) algebra (r = 0) [5, 6], since it is the
latter which is appropriate to n = 4 super yangmills theory.

3 extended harmonic superspaces and short

superelds

we are interested in realizing the highest weight uirs of su(2, 2/n) on
superelds and harmonic superelds.

we shall consider an nextended d = 4 superspace (without central
charges) with grassmann coordinates manifestly covariant with respect to
the su(n) group

z = (x , 

i , 

i

)

(3.1)

using spinor indices of sl(2, c) and indices in the fundamental representa-
tions of su(n) i, k, . . . = 1, . . . , n. (note that the alternative convention
i, 

is sometimes used in the literature.)


i

the covariant opeartors in superspace are the spinor derivatives (see
(a.18)). using them one can dene constrained superelds describing various
irreducible representations of extended supersymmetries. the construction
of supercurrents and superactions from the constrained superelds have been
discussed in refs. [7, 32].

6

for n > 1 the standard superspace (3.1) can be enlarged to a harmonic
superspace (hss) [17] by considering an extra set of harmonic coordinates
u which provide an su(n)-covariant parametrization of the coset space

m =

su(n)

s (u(n1)  . . .  u(nn ))

,

  n
xk=1

nk = n! .

(3.2)

note that such spaces are known in the mathematical literature under the
name of ag manifolds [33, 34, 35]. an exhaustive list of these space and
the corresponding hsss and of their properties for n = 2, 3, 4 is given in
ref.
[21]. the choice of the subgroup depends on the practical use made
of the harmonic variables.
in our context it is crucial to use the highest-
dimensional manifold of type (3.2) which occurs by dividing su(n) by its
maximal torus:

mc =

su(n)
(u(1))n 1 .

(3.3)

this is a manifold of complex dimension n(n  1)/2. the advantage of this
choice is that the residual symmetry (u(1))n 1 is the smallest one possi-
ble. this gives us maximal exibility in dening subspaces of the full n
extended superspace in an su(n) covariant way. such subspaces contain
only a subset of the 4n grassmann variables and are therefore called grass-
mann (g)analytic. they can be viewed as an alternative to the familiar
chiral subspaces [36].

the n = 2 and n = 3 hsss based on the cosets su(2)/u(1) and
su(3)/u(1)  u(1), correspondingly, have been introduced for the o-shell
description of all the n = 2 supersymmetric theories and of n = 3 super-
symmetric yang-mills theory (sym) [17]-[20]. the realisation of the super-
conformal group in these hsss has been studied in refs. [22, 19]. an n = 4
hss involving the manifold su(4)/s(u(2)  u(2)) has been used in ref.
[37] to give a nice interpretation of the on-shell constraints of n = 4 sym
as combined g and harmonic (h)analyticities. this idea has subsequently
been applied to the study of correlation functions of short composite oper-
ators in n = 2 and n = 4 cfts in refs.
[38]. note that hanalyticity is
also important in hsss of lower space-time dimension [39].

in what follows we shall consider the irreducible supereld representation
of su(2, 2/n) using the g and hanalyticities related to the choice (3.3).

7

3.1 the n = 2 case

n = 2 hss has been introduced for the o-shell description of the hypermul-
tiplet and gauge and supergravity multiplets [17]. here we start by describing
the shortening eect of g and hanalyticities on the on-shell matter and
gauge n = 2 multiplets satisfying their free equations of motion. we review
the basic facts about the su(2)/u(1) hss in the appendix.

the hypermultiplet (or n = 2 matter multiplet), which is the supers-
ingleton in the ads literature, can be described by an ordinary supereld
which is an su(2) doublet qi(z) and satises the on-shell constraints [40]:

d(i

 qj)(z) = d(i

qj)(z) = 0 .

(3.4)

now, let us project the su(2) doublets di
u1
i and ui
2

d1

 = di

u1
i ,

, qi and di  with the harmonics

q1 = qiu1

i , d2  = di ui

2 .

(3.5)

this allows us to equivalently rewrite the on-shell constraints (3.4) in the
form of ganalyticity conditions in hss:

d1

q1 = d2 q1 = 0 .

(3.6)

1

the crucial point now is that by letting the supereld q1 have a non-
trivial harmonic dependence one can solve the constraints eqs. (3.6) in terms
of a ganalytic supereld q1(xa, 2, 
, u)  q+ in the appropriate analytic
basis (a.17). this supereld describes the hypermultiplet o shell. it is an
innite-dimensional representation of supersymmetry because of the innite
harmonic expansion on the coset su(2)/u(1)  s2.
in order to put it
back on shell we need to restrict the arbitrary harmonic dependence down
to the initial linear one (3.5). this is achieved with the help of the harmonic
derivatives dened in the appendix. we remark that the harmonic derivative
d 1

2 commutes with the spinor ones from eq. (3.6),

[d 1

2 , d1

] = [d 1

2 , d2 ] = 0 ,

(3.7)

i.e. preserves ganalyticity. thus, the free equation of motion of the hyper-
multiplet takes the form of a harmonic (h-)analyticity condition:

d1

2q1 = 0 ,

(3.8)

where one uses the harmonic derivative in the analytic basis (see (a.20)).

8

this harmonic equation implies a number of constraints on the com-
ponents of the supereld q1. take, for instance, the leading component
1(x, u) = q1|=0. o shell it has an innite harmonic expansion going over
the irreducible products of the harmonics u1,2

:

i

1(x, u) =



xn=0

(i1...in+1j1...jn)(x)u1

i1 . . . u1

in+1u2

j1 . . . u2

jn .

(3.9)

now, the harmonic derivative converts any u2 into u1, so eq. (3.8) implies
the vanishing of all the terms in (3.9) but the rst one,

d 1

2 1(x, u) = 0  1(x, u) = i(x)u1
i .

(3.10)

the same argument can be applied to the higher-order components of the
supereld. thus, the spinor component (x, u) = d2
q1|=0 satises the
constraint

d 1

2 (x, u) = d 1

2 d2

q1|=0 = d1

q1|=0 = 0

(3.11)

(see (3.6)). since this component is chargeless, the harmonic condition (3.11)
implies that it is a singlet, (x, u) = (x). in a similar way one can nd
the complete expansion of the on-shell supereld:

q1 = i(x)u1

i + 

2 (x) + 

1 

 (x) + i
2 

1 

 i(x)u2

i

(3.12)

where all the components satisfy their free massless equations of motion. we
clearly see that this supereld is short in the sense that it only depends
on half of the grassmann variables of the full n = 2 superspace. it is even
ultrashort in the sense that the top spin in it is 1/2 instead of the maximal
spin 1 allowed in a ganalytic scalar supereld.

it is useful to note the relations

(d2)2q1 = (d1)2q1 = 0

(3.13)

which can again be derived from the basic constraints. they are the covariant
form of the statement that the supereld is linear in 2 and 
, as can be
seen from the expansion (3.12).

1

when rewritten in the central basis coordinates x, i, 

i

, the on-shell hy-

permultiplet supereld recovers its original form

q1 = u1

i qi(z)

9

(3.14)

of an su(2) doublet.
meaning as follows. we remark that the harmonic derivatives d i
algebra of su(2)

in fact, this observation can be given an invariant
j form the

[d i

j , d k

l ] = k

j d i

l  i

ld k

j

(3.15)

realized on the supereld q1. as explained in the appendix, the derivative d 1
2
is the positive root (creation operator) of this algebra. then the condition
(3.8) simply denes the highest weight of an su(2) representation. the
quantum number associated to this representation (superisospin) coincides
with this of the rst component. to see this we write down the casimir of
this su(2),

c2 = d i

j d j

i =

(d0)2 + d0 + 2d 2

1 d 1
2

(3.16)

1
2

1  d 2

where d0 = d 1
2 is the u(1) charge operator. then, applying this
casimir to the on-shell supereld q1 satisfying the h-analyticity constraint
(3.8) and using the fact that it carries a denite u(1) charge, d0q1 = q1, we
obtain

c2q1 =

q1 .

(3.17)

3
2

we see that q1 is an eigenfunction of the casimir, realizing the doublet
(isospin 1/2) representation, just like its rst component (see (3.10)). the
important point here is that the harmonic derivatives d i
j commute with the
supersymmetry generators, therefore c2 is the superisospin casimir of the
entire poincare supersymmetry algebra. note that this algebra has another
casimir, that of superspin. we can apply similar arguments to compute the
value of this casimir on the supereld q1. indeed, the g-analyticity condi-
tions (3.6) are equivalent to demanding that the positive odd roots of the
poincare supersymmetry algebra annihilate q1. this ensures that the super-
spin also takes a denite eigenvalue, so the on-shell supereld q1 realizes an
irrep of poincare supersymmetry (see in this context ref. [41] for a general
discussion of irreducibility conditions on superelds).

the above analysis can be repeated for other superelds satisfying both
the g and hanalyticity conditions but carrying dierent u(1) charges.
take, for instance, the o-shell linear multiplet. in hss it is described by a
ganalytic supereld l11 of u(1) charge +2 [18]. unlike the hypermultiplet
q1, this time the hanalyticity condition

d1

2l11 = 0

10

(3.18)

does not put the supereld on shell. the only restriction on the components
involving space-time derivatives is that the vector in l11 must be divergence-
less. the su(2) casimir now takes the eigenvalue 4 which corresponds to
isospin 1 (triplet irrep). to put this supereld on shell, an additional con-
straint is required,

(d2)2l11 = 0 .

(3.19)

this hanalytic superelds of charge +2 is not ultrashort. hanalyticity for
superelds of charge q  +3 still makes them irreducible but does not yield
any constraints on the remaining components.

now we turn to the other basic multiplet of n = 2 supersymmetry,
that of sym. the free on-shell ultrashort maxwell multiplet is described by
a chiral (harmonic independent) supereld satisfying an additional second-
order constraint

d kw = 0 , d(idj)

 w = 0 .

in the chiral basis, the on-shell components of this supereld are

w = (x) + 

i i

(x) + (i)

i f .

(3.20)

(3.21)

this is another example of an ultrashort multiplet (its expansion goes only
up to 2, as compared to 4 for a generic chiral n = 2 supereld).

we do not consider here the non-abelian generalization of the hss de-
scription of the hypermultiplet and gauge multiplet [17, 42].
it should be
stressed that the linear hanalyticity condition (3.8) is valid for gauge-
invariant superelds only, otherwise it should contain a harmonic connection.
we can now use the two objects above, the on-shell hypermultiplet q1 and
the sym eld strength w as building blocks which will allow us to construct
all the short representations of su(2, 2/2). by adapting the series a), b),
c) from section 2 for n = 2 we have [28]:

a)
b)
c)

  2 + 2j2 + r + 2i  2 + 2j1  r + 2i,
 = r + 2i  2 + 2j  r + 2i,
 = 2i,

j1 = j2 = r = 0 .

j1j2  0 ;

j1 = j, j2 = 0 ;

(3.22)

a general long multiplet, belonging to the a) series, contains 4 s, 4 s
and jmax = 2 (in the case of j1 = j2 = 0 for the highest weight state, i.e.
for the  =  = 0 supereld component). in terms of our building blocks
this series corresponds to chiral-antichiral multiplication of the type w w ,

11

or to analytic-antianalytic multiplication of hypermultiplets of the type q1q2
(where q2 = d 2
1 q1 is a supereld satisfying antianalyticity constraints), or
to products of both.

series b) for j = 0, i = 0 corresponds to chiral multiplets which can be

obtained by the following operator series:

tr[w p]

(3.23)

(p = 1,  = r = 1 is the on-shell sym multiplet itself dened in (3.20)).
these superelds depend on the 4 left-handed 
i and one immediately sees
that the top spin in their expansion belongs to the lorentz representation
(1, 0). the above series is chiral (short) and for n = 2 may be called tensor
multiplet tower [23], since the maximum spin is (1, 0) (with i = 0 and
(1,0) = 1 + p).

series c) corresponds to the analytic multiplication of hypermultiplets:

inv(q1)2i

(3.24)

where the symbol inv means a gauge invariant product. the case i = 1/2
corresponds to the on-shell hypermultiplet itself. the lowest component of
these superelds is in the isospin i su(2) representation. the superelds
depend on the 2 left-handed 
, so the top spin
(for i > 1
2) vector in the isospin i  1 su(2) representation with
dimension ( 1
2 ) = 2i + 1. for i = 1 the vector is conserved and gives a
, 1
current supereld (this is the linear multiplet (3.18)).

there is another intermediate shortening in the b) series (j = 0) obtained

by multiplying chiral with ganalytic superelds:

inv[w p(q1)2i] .

(3.25)

this supereld is ganalytic in a weaker sense than either w or q1, satisfying
only the constraint (dropping the inv symbol)

d2 [w p(q1)2i] = 0 ,

(3.26)

and so it depends on the 4

there are other even shorter multiplets when the component elds satisfy
spacetime constraints i.e. conservation laws (transversality) or equations
of motion. this happens when the dimension takes a particular value.

12

in a) w w has  = 2 (j1 = j2 = 0), r = 0, i = 0 and corresponds
to the conserved stress-tensor multiplet. there is a similar object in the
analytic-antianalytic multiplication of q1 and q2 = d2

1q1 .

the supereld w pq1 satises the additional linearity constraint (see (3.13)

and (3.20))

(d1)2[w pq1] = 0 ,

(3.27)

so it depends on the 4 s and only linearly on 1.
in b)  = 1 and in
c) i = 1

the ads/cf t language the  = 2, r = j1 = j2 = i = 0 (in a)) and
 = 2, r = j1 = j2 = 0, i = 1 (in c)) correspond to massless graviton and
gauge bosons (current superelds). semishort multiplets, obeying to a)
treshold, also exist. they are w w n, n > 1, (d(i
j)(w w n) = 0) with
 = 1 + n, r = n  1 i.e.  = 2 + r.

3.2 the n = 3 case

3.2.1 the n = 3 super yangmills multiplet

the n = 3 yangmills multiplet is described by the eld strength supereld
[32, 19] wij(x, )  ijkw k dened by anticommuting the gauge-covariant
spinor derivatives:

{i , j } =   wij

(3.28)

or by the conjugate supereld w
the following on-shell constraints:

(i

wkl  i

l dk

wkj),

di wjk + dj wik = 0

(3.29)

(3.30)

and their complex conjugates.

the su(3)/u(1)u(1) hss has been introduced for the o-shell descrip-
tion of the n = 3 yang-mills theory [19]. here we shall use this superspace
for the classication of the short on-shell n = 3 multiplets. some basic facts
about n = 3 hss are given in the appendix.

one can dene three dierent harmonic projections of the abelian on-

shell supereld wij:

w23  w 1 = ui

2uj

(3.32)
(3.33)

by projecting the on-shell constraints (3.29), (3.30) with the appropriate har-
monics one nds sets of ganalyticity constraints on each of these superelds.
they lie in three dierent analytic superspaces with six odd coordinates (see
the appendix).

consider, for example, the supereld w 1 satisfying the following condi-

tions of ganalyticity

d2 w 1 = d3 w 1 = d1

w 1 = 0

meaning that

w 1 = w 1(xa, 2, 3, 

1

, u)

(3.34)

(3.35)

in the appropriate analytic basis (a.17).

the ganalytic supereld w 1 is a harmonic supereld with an innite ex-
pansion on the harmonic coset. in order to get back the original constrained
harmonic-independent supereld wij(x, ) we need to impose conditions of
hanalyticity. to this end we should use only the harmonic derivatives cor-
responding to the positive roots of su(3) (see the appendix). these are:

d1

2w 1 = d2

3w 1 = d1

3w 1 = 0 .

(3.36)

as expected, they form a closed algebra (cr structure) with the spinor
derivatives in (3.34), i.e. preserve ganalyticity. note that only the rst
(3.36) is the true equation of motion. the second one is purely
of eqs.
kinematical and the third one is a corollary of the rst two, since d1
3 =
[d1

2, d2
3].
the hanalyticity conditions (3.36) have the meaning of su(3) irre-
j form the algebra of su(3)

ducibility conditions. indeed, the derivatives d i

[d i

j , d k

l ] = k

j d i

l  i

ld k

j

(3.37)

realized on the supereld w 1. then (3.36) just denes the highest weight
of an irrep. to nd out which one, we can write down the casimirs of this
su(3),

c3 = d i

j d j

kd k

i

(3.38)

c2 = d i

j d j

i ,

14

and rearrange the derivatives so that all the analytic ones from eq. (3.36)
are on the right. then, applying these casimirs to the on-shell supereld
w 1 and using the fact that it carries a denite u(1)  u(1) charge,

d 1

1 w 1 = w 1 , d 2

2 w 1 = d 3

3 w 1 = 0 ,

(3.39)

we nd that w 1 is an eigenfunction of the casimirs. since the harmonic
derivatives are supersymmetric invariant, we can switch back to the basis in
superspace where the s are not projected with harmonics. there w 1 =
w iu1
3wij and we come back to the original form (3.31). thus, the
super-su(3) quantum numbers of the supereld w 1 coincide with those of
its rst component.

i = ui

2uj

the ganalytic supereld is also an eigenfunction of the superspin casimir.
the reason is that it is annihilated by half of the odd generators (spinor
derivatives), so it is a highest weight of the entire n = 3 poincare supersym-
metry algebra. moreover, the close examination of the components below
shows that they are on shell, satisfying massless equations of motion. thus,
w 1 realizes an irrep of conformal supersymmetry as well.

it is easy to prove that w 1 also obeys linearity conditions with respect

to each :

(d2)2w 1 = (d2d3)w 1 = (d3)2w 1 = (d1)2w 1 = 0 .

(3.40)

this is done by using the harmonic derivatives, e.g.,

d1

2(d2)2w 1 = 2(d1d2)w 1 = 0  (d2)2w 1 = 0 .

(3.41)

further, by examining the components of the supereld w 1 one nds

that the top chargeless component lies very low in the  expansion:

f +
 = d2

(d3

)w 1|0 .

(3.42)

acting with harmonic derivatives on the higher-order spinor derivatives (com-
ponents) of w 1 one can easily show that all of them are expressed in terms of
space-time derivatives of the preceding components. in this way, one nally
obtains the components of the ultrashort on-shell supereld w 1:

w 1 = 1 + 

1

3 ( 1) .

3 2  i

(3.43)

15

where the physical elds satisfy massless eld equations.

one can treat the projection w 2 = w13 in a similar way. the spinor

and harmonic derivatives annihilating w 2 are

d2

, d1 , d3 , d1

3, d2

1, d2
3 .

(3.44)

the harmonic conditions make the leading component [w 2]|0 an irrep of
su(3), and thus give denite super-su(3) quantum numbers to the whole
supereld. the corresponding linearity conditions are

(d1)2w 2 = (d1d3)w 2 = (d3)2w 2 = (d2)2w 2 = 0 .

(3.45)

the abelian supereld w 2 lives in a rotated version of the ganalytic su-
perspace (a.17):

a, 1, 3, 

w 2(x

a = x + i1

, u)

.

(3.46)

(3.47)

the components of w 2 are obtained from those of w 1 (3.43) by exchanging
1w 1, so both superelds describe the
1 with 2. it is evident that w 2 = d2
same on-shell vector multiplet.

finally, consider the harmonic projection of the n = 3 supereld w

the on-shell constraints on w

once again, this is another equivalent description of the same n = 3 on-shell
sym multiplet.

3.2.2 series of short n = 3 multiplets

the a), b), c) uirs of the su(2, 2/3) algebra are given by adapting the
quantities x, y to the n = 3 case with m1 = a + b, m2 = a where [a, b] are
the su(3) dynkin labels.
it then follows that (m = m1 + m2 = 2a + b):

(3.58)

the yangmills (supersingleton) multiplet corresponds to series c) for
a = 0, b = 1, r =  1
3 .

now, let us realize these abstract short representations in terms of the
sym superelds w . the series c) for a = 0 corresponds to the tower with
maximal shortening:

tr(w 1)b = c[0, b] .

(3.59)

this is a supereld depending on 4 s and 2 s, consequently the maximum
spin (b > 1) is j = 3
2). the rst compo-
nent is a scalar with dimension  = b and r-charge r = b/3 in the [0, b] uir
of su(3). the case b = 1 is the ultrashort yangmills singleton w 1.

2 in the lorentz representation (1, 1

the short hanalytic superelds for b = 2, 3 have the the following charge-

less components:

(d2)2(d3)2c[0, 2] , d2

(d3

)(d1)2c[0, 3] .

(3.60)

all the higher components are space-time derivatives of the lower ones. in
the case b  4 hanalyticity does not lead to any extrashortening, e.g. the
supereld c[0, 4] contains an independent top component

(d2)2(d3)2(d1)2c[0, 4] .

(3.61)

the complete c) series of short multiplets can be obtained by taking the

products

(w 1)b(w 12)a = c[a, b]

(3.62)

(we omit the traces). the rst components of these superelds contain an-
alytic harmonics with a + b indices ) 1 and a indices 2 corresponding to the
uir [a, b] of su(3). we obtain the generic short operator of the c) series
with  = a + b, r = 1
3(a  b) and with jmax = 2 = (1, 1), since this operator
contains 4 , 4 .

now, let us consider c[a, b] as an abstract ganalytic supereld

c[a, b] = c[a, b](2, 3, 

1

2

)

, 

with the given su(3) quantum numbers. the hanalyticity conditions for
these representations are the same as those for the building block w 1 (see
(3.36)),

d1

2c[a, b] = d2

3c[a, b] = d1

3c[a, b] = 0 .

(3.63)

18

this is equivalent to imposing an su(3) irreducibility condition. using both
g and hanalyticity one can derive various constraints on the components.
for instance, we nd the following highest chargeless components in the
simplest cases:

(d3

)d1( d2 )c[1, 1] ,

d2
(d2)2(d3)2d1( d2 )c[1, 2] ,
(d2)2(d3)2(d1)2d2 c[1, 3] .

(3.64)

(3.65)

(3.66)

from these levels of the expansion on the corresponding superelds should
become short. note, however, that there is an additional linearity constraint
in the case a = 1,

(d2)2c[1, b] = 0 ,

(3.67)

which follows from the properties of w
be obtained from hanalyticity alone.

12

in the product (3.62) but cannot

the multiplet which is dual to the graviton multiplet of n = 6 super-
gravity in ads5 is given in (3.64) (c[1, 1]). indeed the top component is the
spin 2 (1, 1) graviton multiplet with  = 4. this is a current supereld.

note that (3.62) for b = a is invariant under an additional r-phase wi 

eiwi which commutes with the su(2, 2/3) algebra [8, 43].

by selecting the r invariant singlets c[a, a] we obtain a tower of spin 2
3 bps states of n = 6 supergravity [8, 32]. other

short multiplets which are 1
cases in this class of analytic representations have no semishortening.

the next series of representations is given by the products

(w 1)a+b(w 2)a = b[a, b] .

(3.68)

this supereld satises only one ganalyticity condition,

d3 b[a, b] = 0  b[a, b] = b[a, b](1, 2, 3, 

1

2

, 

) .

(3.69)

this implies that the top spin in it is jmax = 5
hanalyticity constraints as in (3.36),

2 = ( 3

2, 1). further, the same

d1

2b[a, b] = d2

3b[a, b] = d1

3b[a, b] = 0

(3.70)

imply that the rst component belongs to the uir [a, b]. the dimension and
r-charge of this supereld are

 = 2a + b ,

r = 

1
3

(2a + b) .

(3.71)

19

one can prove the following constraints:

d1( d2 )b[a, b] = 0 ,
(d1)2d2 b[a, b] = (d2)2d1 b[a, b] = 0 .

(3.72)

(3.73)

2

1

thus, this representation can contain all 6 s and bilinear scalar combination
(


the superelds b[1, b] satisfy the following additional conditions:

).

(d1)2b[1, b] = (d2)2b[1, b] = 0

(3.74)

which follow from the properties of w 2. the supereld b[1, 0] = w 1w 2 is
even further constrained:

(d2)2b[1, 0] = (d1)2b[1, 0] = 0 .

we nd the following highest chargeless components:

(d3
d2

)d1 b[1, 0] ,
(d3)2d1 b[1, 1] ,

d1
d1
(d1d2)(d3)2(d1)2b[2, 1] .

(3.75)

(3.76)

(3.77)

(3.78)

this means that these superelds are semishort.

these representations belong to the b) series (j = 0).
the series a) corresponds typically to superelds with 6 , 6  and for

j1 = j2 = 0 contains multiplets with jmax = 3 = ( 3

2 , 3

2).

the last series (still corresponding to the b) shortening) can be con-

structed by taking the products

(w 1)p+q+n(w 2)q+n(w 12)n = b [q + 2n, p] , n  1 .

(3.79)

it lives in the same superspace with 10 spinor coordinates as b[a, b] and
has its rst component in the su(3) uir [q + 2n, p].
it is clear that one
can nd members of both series having their rst components in the same
uir, b [q + 2n, p] and b[q + 2n, p]. however, the two short multiplets are
not equivalent. the dimension and r-charge of the b [q + 2n, p] series are
 = p + 2q + 3n, r =  1
3 (p + 2q + n) whereas for the b[q + 2n, p] series they
are  = p + 2q + 4n, r =  1

3 (p + 2q + 4n).

in conclusion we can say that the short analytic n = 3 representations are
dened by the choice of the lowest harmonic representation, the grassmann
dimension and the quantum numbers  and r.

20

3.3 the n = 4 case

3.3.1 the n = 4 sym multiplet

the n = 4 yangmills multiplet is described by the eld strength supereld
w ij(x, ) satisfying the reality condition [37]

w ij =

1
2

ijklwkl ,

wkl = w

kl

and the following on-shell constraints:

di w jk =

1
3
w jk + dj
w ik = 0 .

(j

di

i dl w lk  k

i dl w lj) ,

(3.80)

(3.81)

note that both forms of w contain f and f  , so we do not use the
notation w for n = 4.

we shall rewrite these constraints in n = 4 hss. to this end we have
to chose one of the harmonic coset spaces for the group su(4) listed in ref.
[21]. it should be pointed out that a harmonic interpretation of the n = 4
sym constraints has already been proposed in refs.
[32]. it makes use of
the harmonic coset su(4)/s(u(2)  u(2)). this approach turns out too
restrictive for the analysis of all representations, since the residual symmetry
s(u(2)  u(2)) is too big. in order to have maximal exibility we shall use
harmonics on the coset su(4)/u(1)3 (see the appendix for details of the
denition and the basic properties).

with the help of these harmonics we can introduce three independent

projections of the on-shell eld strength:

w 12  u1
w 13  u1
w 23  u2

i u2
i u3
i u3

j w ij = w34
j w ij = w42
j w ij = w14 .

(3.82)

(3.83)

(3.84)

it is easy to see that the constraints on w ij imply that these three superelds
belong to three dierent ganalytic subspaces of hss. for example, the
projection w 12 satises the ganalyticity constraints corresponding to the
following spinor derivatives:

d1

w 12 = d2

w 12 = d3 w 12 = d4 w 12 = 0 .

(3.85)

21

in the appropriate basis in superspace (a.17) the analytic w 12 has the form

w 12 = w 12(xa, 3, 4, 

1

2

, 

, u) .

(3.86)

we see that w 12 depends on only 8 out of the 16 s of the full n = 4
superspace. it is then obvious that its  expansion can in principle go up to
spin 2:

w 12 = . . . + 

3 
4 

1


 + . . . .

2

a  

(3.87)

this is an example of a short multiplet (a generic n = 4 supereld expansion
goes up to spin 4). in fact, w 12 is even shorter, as we shall see in the next
subsection.

in order to achieve equivalence with the original constraints (3.80), (3.81)
we have to eliminate the non-trivial harmonic dependence of w . this is
done by imposing conditions of hanalyticity, in addition to ganalyticity.
as in the cases n = 2, 3, we choose the set of six harmonic derivatives
corresponding to the positive roots of su(4):

d i

j w 12 = 0 ,

i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, i < j .

(3.88)

they dene the highest weight of an su(4) irrep. in fact, among them only
three are independent, (d 1
4 )w 12 = 0, but it is often convenient to
use all the six. the implications of the condition d 1
2 w 12 = 0 on the leading
component in the  expansion of w 12 = 12(x, u) + . . . are easy to see:

2 , d 2

3 , d 3

d 1

2 (ij(x)u1

i u2

j ) = ij(x)u1

i u1

j = 0  ij = ji

(3.89)

since the harmonic variables commute. in other words, the component  is
in the su(4) uir [0, 1, 0]. the remaining harmonic conditions eliminate any
dependence on the other harmonics in 12(x, u). the same argument shows
that the remaining components of the supereld either belongs to uirs of
su(4)(if they are not expressed in terms of the lower components or just
vanish), so that in the end the entire supereld recovers its original trivial
harmonic dependence shown in eq. (3.84).

the harmonic conditions (3.88) ensure that the supereld w 12 forms a
representation of supersymmetry with xed su(4) super-quantum numbers.
indeed, the harmonic derivatives d i

j form the algebra of su(4),

[d i

j , d k

l ] = k

j d i

l  i

ld k

j

(3.90)

22

realized on w 12. at the same time, these derivatives are super-covariant, i.e.
commute with the supersymmetry generators. therefore the su(4) casimir
operators

cn = d i1

i2 d i2

i3 . . . d in
i1 ,

n = 2, 3, 4

(3.91)

are automatically super casimirs. now, the su(4) algebra (3.90) allows us to
rewrite (3.91) in such a way that all the d i
j with i < j appear on the right,
after which we can make use of the conditions (3.88). thus, the casimirs
are reduced to polynomials of the charge operators d i
i and take eigenvalues
on the supereld w 12 determined by its charges. the conclusion is that the
supermultiplet described by w 12 has denite su(4) quantum numbers which
coincide with those of its rst component.

in exactly the same way one can show that the other two projections of
the eld strength live in the two alternative ganalytic subspaces involving
only 8 s each:

w 13(x
a, 2, 4, 
1
x
a = x  i(1

where the corresponding ganalytic bases in superspace have been used.

in addition, these ganalytic superelds satisfy hanalyticity conditions
which can be obtained from eq. (3.88) by permuting the indices. as before,
they make the supereld an irrep of su(4). it should be stressed that these
analyticity conditions are at (linear) for all w s in the abelian theory or
when applied to gauge-invariant composite operators of the type trw n in
the non-abelian theory.

3.3.2 series of short multiplets

the uirs of the p su(2, 2/4) superalgebra fall in three classes [6, 28]:



a)

  2+j1+j2+a+b+c ,

(or j1  j2, a  c)
(3.94)
massless bulk multiplets correspond to maximal shortenings with j2 =
j1, a = b = c = 0

b)

(a + 2b + 3c)  2 + 2j +

(3a + 2b + c) ,

j1 = j , j2 = 0
(3.95)

(or j1  j2, a  c) with   1 + j + a + b + c, 1 + j  1

2 (c  a)

c)

 = 2a + b ,

a = c ,

j1 = j2 = 0

(3.96)

series c) contains the yangmills multiplet for a = 0, b = 1 and the
kk tower of short multiplets for b = p > 1 and a = c = 0.

the discussion of the properties of the ganalytic supereld w 12 above ap-
plies to any of its powers

(w 12)p = c[0, p, 0]

(3.97)

(or to tr(w 12)p in the non-abelian case). the notation indicates the dynkin
su(4) labels [0, p, 0] of the rst component of the supereld.

these superelds satisfy the set of ganalyticity conditions

(d1

, d2

, d3 , d4 )c[0, p, 0] = 0 ,

(3.98)

and are therefore short multiplets (maximal spin 2= (1, 1)). as before, the
harmonic conditions

d i

j c[0, p, 0] = 0 ,

i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, i < j

(3.99)

ensure irreducibility under su(4). indeed, consider the leading component

[(w 12)p]|0 = (i1...ip)(j1...jp)u1

j1 . . . u2
ipu2
i1 . . . u1
j1u2
ipu1
i1 . . . u1

jp

d 1
2

(i1...ipj1)(j2...jp)u1

j2 . . . u2

jp = 0 .

(3.100)

this condition eliminates the symmetrization between the indices of the rst
and second set and thus renders the eld irreducible, belonging to the su(4)
uir [0, p, 0]. the alternative proof of irreducibility makes use of the positive
root or the casimir argument above.
the series above corresponds to kk towers of iib supergravity on ads5 
s5 [44] and it was obtained using the oscillator method by gunaydin and

24

marcus [45]. its relation with analytic superelds with harmonic variables of
su (2)su (2)u (1) [37] was discussed in [12].

su (4)

another way of obtaining new short representations is to multiply two

w s with dierent ganalyticities, e.g.

[w 12(3, 4, 

1

2

, 

)]p+q[w 13(2, 4, 

1

3

, 

)]q = c[q, p, q]

(3.101)

(we postpone the discussion of the role of the traces to the next section, and
from now on we omit the traces). the lowest component of the corresponding
irreducible supereld belongs to the uir [q, p, q] with p + 2q indices 1, p + q
indices 2 and q indices 3 in the corresponding rows of the yt. (note that
interchanging w 12 and w 13 would give an equivalent series). it is clear that
such superelds satisfy only a subset of the ganalyticity conditions above:

d1

c[q, p, q] = d 

4 c[q, p, q] = 0

(3.102)

and thus depend on 12 out of the total of 16 s. as a consequence, the value
of the spin in their expansions cannot exceed 3 = ( 3
2 ). next, we have to
impose the set of hanalyticity constraints

2, 3

d i

j c[q, p, q] = 0 ,

i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, i < j

(3.103)

which are clearly compatible with the ganalyticity of c[q, p, q]. note that
they coincide with those for the preceding series (3.99) which is needed for
consistency if we set q = 0. as before, the eect of these conditions is to
single out the su(4) uir [q, p, q]. indeed, the leading component

(i1...ip+2q)(j1...jp+q)(k1...kq)u1

i1 . . . u1

ip+2qu2

j1 . . . u2

jp+qu3

k1 . . . u3

kq

(3.104)

3 , d 2
becomes irreducible after imposing the constraints involving d 1
3
(they remove all possible symmetrizations among the dierent sets of indices).

2 , d 1

the third possibility involves all the three ganalytic w s:

c[q + 2n, p, q] = [(w 12)p+q+n(w 13)q+n(w 23)n] .

(3.105)

this time there is only one ganalyticity condition left,

d4 c[q + 2n, p, q] = 0 .

(3.106)

consequently, the supereld depends on 14 s (8 left-handed and 6 right-
handed) and the spins in its expansion can go up to 7/2 = (2, 3
2). the
hanalyticity constraints are

d i

j c[q + 2n, p, q] = 0 ,

i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, i < j .

(3.107)

25

once again, they look the same as those for the c[0, p, 0] series (3.99) and for
the c[q, p, q] series (3.103) (needed for consistency). the irrep corresponding
to the leading component now is [q + 2n, p, q].

concluding this subsection we note that there exist other ganalytic
subspaces involving 10 out of the 16 s, for example, 1,2 , 
. however,
superelds living in such subspaces cannot be obtained by multiplying w s.

1,2,3

3.3.3 extra shortening of n=4 superelds

as in the cases n = 2, 3 before, the n = 4 representations can in some
case be semishort. the simplest example is the supereld w 12 itself, which
is ultrashort. due to the g and hanalyticity constraints (3.85), (3.88) it
describes the on-shell n = 4 ultrashort sym multiplet containing six scalars

ij = ji, four spinors i (and their conjugates 
i ) and the eld strength
f +
  . thus, its  expansion is eectively shorter than that of a generic
ganalytic supereld of the type (3.86).

(3.108)

to see this take, for instance, the component at 3
. it can be dened using
the spinor derivatives of w 12 at  = 0, a23
d1 w 12|0. now, w 12
3 w 12 =
is subject to the hanalyticity conditions (3.88), in particular, d 1
0. applying this to the component and using the ganalyticity condition
d1

w 12 = 0, we nd

  = d3

1

d 1

3 a23

  = d1

d1 w 12|0 = i w 12|0 = i 12 .

(3.109)

the resulting harmonic equation has the obvious solution a23

  = i 23.
inspecting the supereld expansion (3.108) one sees that each  (or ) ap-
pears only linearly. this means that the supereld w 12 satises grassmann
linearity conditions of the type, e.g.,

(d3)2w 12 = 0 .

(3.110)

26

once again, this constraint can be easily derived by using the basic g and
hanalyticity properties of w 12. indeed, denote a1233 = (d3)2w 12 and hit
it with the harmonic derivatives d 1

3 , d 2
3 :

d 1

3 a1233 = d 2

3 a1233 = 0 .

(3.111)

these two constraints ensure the su(4) reducibility of (the leading compo-
nent of) a1233 by eliminating all the symmetrizations between indices pro-
jected with dierent harmonics. then we can rewrite it as a1233 = a3
4 and
by hitting it with d 1

3 we nd
3 a3

d 1

4 = a1

4 = 0  a1233 = 0 .

(3.112)

in the same way one can readily prove the following relations

(d3d4)w 12 = (d1d2)w 12 = 0 ,

(3.113)

(d3)2w 12 = (d4)2w 12 = (d1)2w 12 = (d2)2w 12 = 0 .

(3.114)
another way to nd out that the supereld w 12 is ultrashort is to notice

that the components

f +
 = d3

(d4

)w 12 ,

  = d1( d2 )w 12
f 

(3.115)

are the highest (in this case the only) chargeless ones in the expansion.
adding one more spinor derivative (i.e., moving a step up in the expan-
sion) produces a charged component which is eliminated by the harmonic
conditions. for example, take 3 = d3d1d2w 12|0 and hit it with d 1
3 :

d 1

3 3

   = d 1

3 d3

d1 d2 w 12|0 = i d2 w 12|0 = i 1


 i

   = i i

 .

(3.116)

thus, we can say that the expansion of the supereld w 12 ends at the level
of 2 s (in the sense that all the higher components are expressed in terms
of derivatives of the lower ones). we call such superelds ultrashort.

the linearity property of w 12 is of course lost when we start multiplying
them. nevertheless, (w 12)2 and (w 12)3 are still shorter than a generic su-
pereld of the same ganalyticity type. according to the general discussion
in section 2, p = 2 gives a current supereld while p = 3 gives a semishort
multiplet. indeed, let us examine the top component of c[0, p, 0]  (w 12)p:

(0,p4,0)  (d3d4d1d2)2(w 12)p|=0 .

(3.117)

27

for p  4 this is a eld containing an su(4) irrep which survives all the
harmonic conditions (for p = 4 it becomes a singlet), so the supereld is not
ultrashort. for p = 3 we nd singlets at the level of 6 s:

(d3)2(d4)2d1( d2 )c[0, 3, 0] ,

d3

(d4

)(d1)2(d3)2c[0, 3, 0] .

(3.118)

they are not aected by the harmonic conditions and indeed, by taking
the expansion (3.108) of a single w 12 to the third power we do nd such
components. any higher component will carry a charge and will be killed
by the harmonic conditions (for instance, 4 = d3(d4d1d2)2(w 12)3|=0 is
annihilated by d 1

4 ). thus, the expansion of c[0, 3, 0] ends at 6 s.

similarly, for c[0, 2, 0] = (w 12)2 we nd the singlets

(d3)2(d4)2c[0, 2, 0] ,
(d1)2(d3)2c[0, 2, 0] ,
d3

(d4

)d1( d2 )c[0, 2, 0] ,

which are indeed present in the square of the expansion (3.108). thus,
c[0, 2, 0] is another extrashort supereld ending at 4 s, it is in fact a cur-
rent supereld.

in the cases of the series c[q, p, q] with q > 1 and c[q + 2n, p, q] with
n > 1 the same analysis shows that the top component is always present.
in the case (w 12)p+1w 13 the supereld is linear in 2 because this is the
property of w 13 and w 12 does not depend on 2. similarly, the product
(w 12)p+q+1(w 13)q+1w 23 is linear in 1. the above cases correspond to sem-
ishortening. these superelds are even shorter for certain values of p and q,
but this requires an additional analysis.

4 multitrace operators and multiparticle states

the analysis of dierent classes of n = 4 conformal supermultiplets obeying
dierent types of shortening conditions has an interesting application to some
states which are not kk states but have rather the interpretation of
multiparticle states [46, 47] in the ads/cft correspondence.

in n = 4 yangmills theory these states correspond to the decomposition
of the product of some short (single trace) kk multiplets into irreducible
superconformal blocks. such blocks necessarily contain multitrace (rather

28

than single trace) [48, 49, 47] yangmills gauge-invariant operators which in
general are not in the same representations of the short kk multiplets.

in this section we will make the analysis for the most general double-
trace and triple-trace gauge invariant operators of n = 4 yangmills. the
extension to higher multitraces is in principle straightforward.

let us denote by 12, 13, 23 the lowest  components of the three super-

elds w 12, w 13, w 23. consider now the gauge invariant operators:

s)
d)
t)

tr[(12)p]
tr[(12)p+q]tr[(13)q]
tr[(12)p+q+n]tr[(13)q+n]tr[(23)n]

(4.1)

sequence s) is the usual kk tower of iib supergravity on ads5s5. it gives
all multiplets with jmax = 2 (more precisely a (1, 1) tensor in the [0, p  2, 0]
uir of su(4)) and the rst component is

tr(1    p)

symmetric traceless

where  is a scalar in the [0, 1, 0] of su(4) dened as:

 = w |=0  ()ijw ij.

(4.2)

(4.3)

sequences d) are the double-trace operators. the  = 0 term is contained in
the product

tr(1    p+q)tr(m1    mq )

(4.4)

where each single trace is symmetric traceless.

as an illustrative example consider for instance the product of two lowest

components of the current multiplet:

tr (cid:20)(12) 

1
6

12(mm)(cid:21) tr (cid:20)(34) 

1
6

34(nn)(cid:21)

it contains the irreducible su(4) components:

20  20 =

105

+

84

+

20

+

1

[0, 4, 0]

[2, 0, 2]

[0, 2, 0]

[0, 0, 0]

(4.5)

(4.6)

the (105) and (84) correspond to two short multiplets with top spin (1, 1)
and ( 3
2) respectively, while the last two are long multiplets with top spin
(2, 2). the latter acquire anomalous dimensions in perturbation theory as

2, 3

29

shown in refs. [47]-[50].
the rst two uirs are contained in tr (12)2 tr (12)2 and tr (12)2 tr (13)2
respectively, while the last two correspond to uirs superelds with 8, 8.
the multiplets in (4.4)decompose in long (jmax = 4) and short multiplets
(jmax = 2, 3). the virtue of the multiplication in d) is that precisely it singles
out all shortening occurring in (4.4).

note that the operator

tr(12)tr(12)m

(4.7)

gives the same uir as tr(12)+m i.e. d( + m, 0, 0; 0,  + m, 0). this means
that the [0, p, 0] uir obtained in any multitrace operator is a short multiplet.
the same type of argument will apply to the other shortenings.

analogously, an operator of the type

tr (cid:16)[12][13]m(cid:17)

would correspond to a single trace rst component ( = 0) operator:

tra1    ab1    bm

(4.8)

(4.9)

where some antisymmetrization of two a, b indices occurs so it would not be
a superconformal primary operator in super yangmills theory [3] (although
it would be conformal primary in an abelian theory where traces are re-
moved, since in that case it would coincide with (12)(13)m). also note
that in a rank 1 abelian theory only s) would survive because in that case
all antisymmetrizations of  would vanish. these considerations also im-
ply that no single power of any 12 (or 13, 23) should occur in the product
(since tr = 0) then implying that linear semishort operators (i.e. operators
satisfying a d2 = 0 constraint) do not occur in su(n ) yangmills theory.

from the general class of shortening we see that d) contains the irreducible

pieces which correspond to the shortening of:

tr[(12)p+q+k]  tr[(13)qk] ,

0  k  q

(4.10)

i.e. to highest weight states of the type d(2q + p, 0, 0; q  k, p + 2k, q  k),
the new one being the k = 0 one, with dynkin label [q, p, q] (k = q  1 is
missing because tr13 = 0). this is precisely the uir singled out by the
h-analyticity constraints (3.103)

30

figure 1: [q, p, q] representation:

3q

all these states have quantized dimensions and lie in multiplets with

jmax = 3, unless k = q, for which jmax = 2.

let us apply this to the cases of double-traces with d  6. the rational to
restrict to s), d), t) families is the following:

 tr[(12)2]  tr[(13)2].

in this case p = 0, q = 2, so the two short reps. are the [0, 4, 0]
(jmax = 2) and [2, 0, 2] (jmax = 3). it has been conrmed by direct
calculation that indeed two such objects are not renormalized in per-
turbative theory (at one loop).

 tr[(12)3]  tr[(13)2].

in this case p = 1, q = 2. the short multiplets are in the [0, 5, 0] and
[2, 1, 2].

 tr[(12)3]  tr[(13)3].

in this case p = 0, q = 3. the short multiplets are in the [0, 6, 0],
[3, 0, 3] and [2, 2, 2].

 tr[(12)4]  tr[(13)2].

in this case p = 2, q = 2. the short multiplets are in the [0, 6, 0] and
[2, 2, 2].

it is thus obvious that the number of short multiplets is precisely q of

which q  1 have jmax = 3 and one has jmax = 2.

we now consider triple-trace operators where a new type of shortening

(jmax = 7

2) occurs.

the generic triple-trace operator is:

tr[(12)p+q+n]tr[(13)q+n]tr[(23)n]

(4.11)

31

with dimension d = p + 2q + 3n.
the above expressions single out the short multiplets contained in the fol-
lowing triple-trace operator composites:

tr(1    p+q+n)tr(m1    mq+n)tr(s1    sn)

(4.12)

the new phenomenon here is that three types of short multiplets with jmax =
2, 3 and 7
2 occur. the new short multiplet is a chiral supereld whose rst
component is in the [q + 2n, p, q] of su(4) and with a jmax = 7
2 state in the
(2, 3
2) rep. of sl(2,c). this is the uir singled out by the constraints (3.107)
from the analysis of the product of:

tr[(w 12)p+q+n]tr[(w 13)q+n]t r[(w 23)n]

(4.13)

it follows that the above triple-trace operators contain all the shortenings
which occur in:

tr[(12)p+q+n+x]tr[(13)q+n+kx]tr[(23)nk] ,

if k  p, or

tr[(12)q+k+n+x]tr[(13)p+q+nx]tr[(23)nk] ,

tr[(12)2]tr[(13)2]tr[(23)2] ,

(p = q = 0; n = 2)

(4.16)

for k = 0, x = 0 it gives the [0, 0, 4] + [4, 0, 0] (jmax = 7
2). for k = 2, it gives
all the shortenings already occurred in tr[(12)4+x]tr[(13)2x]. these are
the [0, 6, 0] and [2, 2, 2] (jmax = 2 and 3 respectively).

this completes the analysis of the shortenings of double and triple trace
operators. of course, due to their ring structure, higher multiple trace op-
erators can be obtained by further multiplying structures as in s) d) t) then
obtaining the same type of shortening as in the previous composite operators.
the bulk interpretation of these composite operators is that there are

some multiparticle bps states in the supergravity side.

the non-renormalization of the [0, 4, 0] and [2, 0, 2] short multiplets
contained in the two graviton-multiplets particle state was shown in n = 4
yangmills perturbation theory in ref. [50, 51]. the latter reference extended
the analysis for the (0, p, 0) block to all multitrace components. its relation
with shortening was established in ref. [12] and [28].

from the shortening conditions we see that while the usual kk states
2 bps (since the supereld does not depend on 4 l, 4 r) the new
8 bps (2 r). the
4 bps operators occur for highest weight d(4, 0, 0; 2, 0, 2)
8 bps states occur for highest

are 1
short classes correspond to 1
lowest dimensional 1
(double-trace) while the lowest dimensional 1
weights d(6, 0, 0; 4, 0, 0) + c.c..

5 conclusion

in the present paper we have analyzed all possible shortenings which are ob-
tained by composite operators made out of the eld strength gauge multiplets
and hypermultiplets (for n = 2).

these shortenings are characterized by subspaces of hsss which do not

depend on a certain number of (fermionic)  variables.

if a certain subspace (of the full superspace with 4n  variables) does
not depend on n fermionic coordinates, then a supereld on such a space is
generally called n

4n bps in analogy with a particle state interpretation.

33

moreover, if n = nl + nr then the highest spin of such a supereld is

(j1, j2) = (cid:18)2n  nl

4

,

2n  nr

4

(cid:19) .

(5.1)

we can summarize the set of subspaces, for each n, by the pair (nl, nr).

all possible shortenings found from the analysis of section 3 are summa-

rized in the following table.

all these representations refer to uirs with highest weight states with
j1 = j2 = 0. in this case the generic long multiplets (massive non-bps
states) have j1 = j2 = 1, 3

2, 2 for n = 2, 3, 4 respectively.

short multiplets have protected dimensions in conformal eld theories.
this is not the case for long multiplets whose dimension is then renormalized.
we found, as an application of these results, that some multiparticle
state channels, occurring in ads5  s5 compactications of iib string theory,
correspond to such short representations.

the ads/cft correspondence of supergravity with large n gauge the-
ories then predicts that supergravity correlators in these channels would ex-
hibit canonical dimensions, then implying a new kind of non-renormalization
theorems for n = 4 super yangmills theory.

a.1 harmonic variables

we introduce harmonic variables on the coset su(n)/u(1)n 1 in the form
of su(n) matrices ui
i. here i is an index
of the fundamental representation of su(n) whereas i = 1, 2, . . . , n is an
index denoting the set of n  1 u(1) charges. the choice of the charges for
n = 2, 3, 4 is as follows:

i or their complex conjugates ui

n = 2 :

n = 3 :

n = 4 :

i

, u2

i = u(1)
u1
i = u(1,0)
u1
i = u(1,0,1)
u1

i = u(1)
;
i = u(1,1)
i = u(1,0,1)

i = u(0,1,1)

;

(a.1)

, u4

i = u(0,1,1)

;

the conjugates have the opposite charges, e.g., in n = 2 ui
2 =
ui(1). the fact that the us form an su(n) matrix implies the following
constraints:

1 = ui(1), ui

u  su(n) :

j ,

j = i
i = k

ui
i ui
ui
i uk
i1...in u1

i

i1 . . . un

in = 1 .

(a.2)
(a.3)
(a.4)

exceptionally, in the case n = 2 one can raise and lower the indices of the
harmonics with the help of the levi-chivita symbol

ikkl = l

i ,

12 = 12 = 1 .

this property allows us to identify the two sets of harmonics ui

i and ui
i:

i  ijuj
u1

2  u2i  u+

i

,

i  ijuj
u2

1  u1i  u

note that in ref. [17], where the n = 2 harmonic variables have been intro-
duced for the rst time, the notation u
i was used. here we prefer to have
an uniform notation valid for any n.

the harmonic functions are supposed to transform homogeneously un-
der u(1)n 1, i.e.
they carry denite u(1) charges. this means that the
dependence on the matrix variables u is considered modulo u(1)n 1 trans-
formations, which provides an su(n) covariant way to parametrize the coset
su(n)/u(1)n 1. these functions are given by their innite harmonic ex-
pansions on the coset. for instance, the function f 1(u) will have the following
expansion in n = 2:

f 1(u) = f iu1

i + f (ijk)u1

i u1

j u2

k + . . .

(a.5)

going over the totally symmetrized multispinors (irreps) of su(2). in n = 3
this expansion is considerably richer,

f 1(u) = f iu1

i + f (ij)

k u1

i u2

juk

2 + g(ij)

k u1

i u3

j uk

3 + h(ij)ui

2uj

3 + . . .

(a.6)

and goes over all possible irreps of su(3) such that after projection with us
the total charge will be that of f 1.

the harmonic coset su(n)/u(1)n 1 has n(n  1)/2 complex dimen-
sions. correspondingly, there are as many covariant derivatives on it. in our
su(n) covariant description of the coset these derivatives are made out of
the operators

 i
j = ui

i

 ui
j


uj
i


ui
i

which respect the dening constraints (a.2), (a.3). the third constraint
(a.4) implies that the charge-like operators  i

i are not independent,

(a.7)

(a.8)

(a.9)

(a.10)

these derivatives act on the harmonics as follows:

 i
i = 0 .

n

xi=1

i
j uk

i = k

j ui

i ,

i

k = i

so, the n  1 u(1) charges are counted by the derivatives

n = 2 :
n = 3 :
n = 4 :

h = 1
h = 1
h = 1

1  2
2 ;
1  2
2 , h  = 2
1  2
2 , h  = 3

2  3

3  4
4 , h  = 1

the remaining n(n  1)/2 derivatives  i
i > j) are the true harmonic derivatives on the coset su(n)/u(1)n 1.

j , i < j (or their conjugates  i
j ,

it is important to realize that the set of n 2  1 derivatives  i

j (taking

into account the linear dependence (a.8)) form the algebra of su(n):

[ i

j ,  k

l ] = k

j  i

l  i

l k

j

.

(a.11)

the cartan decomposition of this algebra l+ + l0 + l is given by the sets

l+ = { i

j , i < j} , l0 = { i
i ,

n

xi=1

 i
i = 0} , l = { i

j , i > j} .

it becomes clear that imposing the harmonic conditions

j f k1...kq(u) = 0 ,
 i

i < j

(a.12)

(a.13)

on a harmonic function with a given set of charges k1 . . . kq denes a highest
weight of an su(n) irrep. in other words, the harmonic expansion of such a
function contains only one irrep which is determined by the combination of
charges k1 . . . kq. for instance, in n = 2 we have (see (a.5))

1
2f 1(u) = 0  f 1(u) = f iu1
i ,

and, similarly, in n = 3 (see (a.6))

1
2f 1(u) = 1

3 f 1(u) = 2

3 f 1(u) = 0  f 1(u) = f iu1
i .

(a.14)

(a.15)

note that not all of the conditions (a.15) are independent since 1
2, 2
3].
written down in a complex parametrization of the coset, conditions (a.13)
take the form of harmonic (h-)analyticity conditions on the function f (u). it
is important to realize that for certain combinations of charges the condition
(a.13) may not have a non-trivial solution. for example, the function f 2(u)
cannot be h-analytic since 1

i = 0  f i = 0.

2 f 2(u) = f iu1

3 = [1

a.2 grassmann analyticity

the introduction of harmonic coordinates allows one to dene various sub-
spaces of the full n-extended superspace involving only a subset of the grass-
mann coordinates without breaking su(n). indeed, we can rewrite the su-
persymmetry transformations in terms of the harmonic-projected grassmann

37

variables as follows:

i  

i ui
i

x  = i(
i ui
i 

i ui
i = 
i ,
i
i
= ui
i 



i

) ,

(a.16)

i

i

i ui

i, 

= ui
i 

i = 

. now, we can shift x  in a variety of ways
where 
such that the transformation of the new variable does not involve some of the
projections of  or . thus we obtain subspaces of the full superspace closed
under supersymmetry. such superspaces are called grassmann (g-)analytic.
here are some examples:

n = 2 :

n = 3 :

n = 4 :

x 
a = x  + i(
2 
x 
a = x  + i(
2 
a = x  + i(

in these examples the g-analytic superspace has the minimal odd dimension
possible, i.e. half of the total number 4n.
in this sense the g-analytic
superspaces are analogs of chiral superspace, which also involves the left-
or right-handed half of the odd variables. however, an important dierence
is that in the cases n > 2 one can also have g-analytic superspaces with
intermediate odd dimensions, i.e. 8 and 10 in n = 3 and 10, 12 and 14 in
n = 4. the reason is that the harmonics on the coset su(n)/u(1)n 1 allow
one to break the spinor variables up into n independent projections, whereas
the chiral projection always picks a spinor in the fundamental representation
of su(n).

an equivalent denition of g-analyticity is to consider superelds satis-
 and di . these deriva-

fying constraints involving the spinor derivatives di
tives commute with supersymmetry and satisfy the following algebra

, dl

} = 0 ,

{dk
{dk , dl } = 0 ,
, dl } = ik
{dk

l   .

(a.18)

which resembles the supersymmetry algebra. now, projecting them with
harmonics, we can impose a number of g-analyticity conditions on the super-
elds (x, , ). for example, the conditions corresponding to the subspaces

38

(a.17) are

n = 2 :
n = 3 :
n = 4 :

d1
d1
d1,2

 = d2  = 0 ;
 = d2,3  = 0 ;
  = d3,4  = 0 .

(a.19)

it is clear that this can be done with any subset of ds and ds as long as
they anticommute.

the role of the shifts of x in (a.17) is to dene a g-analytic basis in which

the derivatives in (a.19) become torsion-free, e.g.

d1

 = 1

 , d2  = 2  ,

etc.

of course, the spinor derivatives which do not belong to the analytic set still
involve space-time derivatives in this basis. more important, the harmonic
derivatives acquire torsion terms in the g-analytic basis. thus, in the bases
(a.17) one has

d1

3 = 1

3  i
3 

1 

   

3 1

 + 

1 

3  ,

etc.

(a.20)

this implies that the condition of h-analyticity on harmonic superelds
(xa, , , u) involves space-time derivatives of the components.
