introduction

the low energy eective theory of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory which has two kinds

of supersymmetry is generated by a holomorphic function called prepotential and any information

concerning the theory is available from the prepotential if it is determined. however, unfortunately,

for this theory instantons are expected to contribute as a non-perturbative eect which can not be

detected in the perturbation theory, and therefore the determination of the prepotential including

this eect was not correctly proceeded so far.

however, in the summer in 1994, seiberg and witten [1, 2] pointed out that in the case of su(2)

gauge theory the prepotential correctly including the instanton eect, often called non-perturbative

or exact solution, can be obtained, provided the periods of 1-form on a riemann surface (elliptic

curve) are given. their proposal was immediately extended by many authors to the cases of other

gauge groups with or without quarks, and a number of papers was appeared in almost three years

since then. most of them was written for miscellaneous aspects of the prepotential and related works,

but the results of these studies supported that the approach taken by seiberg and witten produced

the physically meaningful prepotential.

in this talk, i will show the main results concerning the prepotential from the works proceeded in

this brief period. specically, i will talk on the method of picard-fuchs equation, the evaluation of

the periods and the prepotentials via the barnes type integral representation, the relation between

instanton eect and the well-known scaling relation of prepotential of matone, by using explicit

examples. finally, a perspective will be presented.

2 n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory

2.1 n = 2 supersymmetry

firstly, let us explain what is the supersymmetry [3]. as is well-known, there are particles called

bosons with integer spins and fermions with half-integer spins, and these have dierent statistical

properties. supersymmetry is the symmetry which connects these particles. in the case that one

boson (fermion) corresponds to one fermion (boson), supersymmetry is only one, so it is called n = 1,

while the case of two fermions (bosons) it is called n = 2. the yang-mills theory to be discussed

is the gauge theory enjoying two supersymmetries, namely, it is n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills

theory.

as the particles appearing in this n = 2 yang-mills theory, there are gauge elds a ( =
0,   , 3), weyl fermions (, ) and complex scalar eld  and these as a whole are referred as n = 2
chiral multiplet or gauge multiplet. this chiral multiplet is often arranged by



,

q

which means that a supersymmetrically transform to  and , etc. note that in this multiplet
since the gauge elds are included all particles belonging to this multiplet must take the value in the

adjoint representation of the gauge group g and the number of components (associated with g) is

the same with the dimension of the gauge group.

as an n = 2 theory, other particles can be included, and in that case there is the multiplet called

scalar or hypermultiplet consisting of weyl fermions (q, 

eq ) and the complex bosons (q,eq)

(2.2)

but we will consider the theory dictated by only the chiral multiplet for the moment.

for the description of a theory with supersymmetry, it is convenient to consider a eld (super

eld) on super space which is the space with usual space-time real coordinates x and the grassman
coordinates  ( = 1, 2). in the present case of n = 2 chiral multiplet, since it can be seen that it
consists of two n = 1 multiplets (a, ) and (, ) in view of n = 1 supersymmetry, the lagrangian
of the n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory is compactly written as

(2.4)

where  = (, i),  is an unit matrix of the size 2  2, i(i = 1, 2, 3) are the pauli matrices,
f = a  a  i[a, a]. ellipses are omission. v is expressed by superelds, but the detail
is not necessary here. in (2.3), the complexied coupling constant

0 =

0
2

+ i

4
g2 ,

(2.5)

where 0  r is the vacuum angle and g is the gauge coupling constant, is introduced. the intro-
duction of the vacuum angle is an analogy of n = 0 (non-supersymmetric) qcd, where the vacuum

angle is related to strong cp problem. actually, 0 in this n = 2 theory can be set to zero because
of chiral rotation of fermions.

from the grassman integral and expansion of the products of superelds, l becomes

f  =

2.2 vacuum

in eld theories, a complex scalar eld often plays a role of higgs eld, and it can be shown that

the present case is also the case. from (2.6), it is easy to see that  has the potential

u =

1

2g2 [, ]2 >0,

(2.8)

and the vacuum of the n = 2 yang-mills theory is characterized by the minimum of this potential.

in the case at hand, the vacuum corresponds to u = 0, and  = 0 can be considered as the candidate

of  which realizes the vacuum conguration. however, u = 0 can be realized by some  such that

the commutator vanishes, so it is sucient to parameterize it by using the generators hi of cartan
subalgebra of the gauge group g [4, 5, 6, 7]

 =

rank (g)xi=1

aihi,

(2.9)

where ai are complex parameters. since the weyl symmetry still remains in this parameterization,
it would be convenient to characterize the theory by using quantities which are invariant under this

symmetry. for example, in the case of su(nc) gauge group the candidates are given by

uk = tr hki, k = 2,   , nc.

there exist more convenient parameters than uk, dened by the symmetric polynomials

sk = (1)k

ncxi1<<ik=1

ai1    aik , k = 2,   , nc,

but {uk} and {si} are related each other by the newtons formula

(2.10)

(2.11)

ksk +

kxi=1

skiui = 0, s0 = 1, s1 = u1 = 0.

(2.12)

sk are called moduli of the theory and the space of sk is called moduli space.

3 eective action and prepotential of su(2) gauge theory

3.1 eective action

when  has a non-zero vacuum expectation value, gauge elds gain masses by higgs mechanism.
for example, in the case of su(2) gauge group,  can be written by  = a3, where a = hi  c, and
the gauge symmetry breaks down from su(2) to u(1) for a 6= 0. then w 
)/2 and their
supersymmetric particles (superpartners) gain mass  a, while a3
 and their superpartners remain
massless. furthermore, when the vacuum expectation value of  is zero, the original su(2) gauge
symmetry is restored, therefore the classical moduli space has a singularity at u  tr h2i = 2a2 = 0.

 := (a1

  a2

on the other hand, in a quantum theory, the dynamics of particles is described by an action
including quantum eects called eective action. in the case of a 6= 0, for large a the masses of w 

and corresponding superpartners also become large. these heavy particles do not actively move

and only massless particles play an essential role. then these massive particles can be dropped out
in the case that the energy scale, say , is small (|a|  ). if these massive particles are integrated
out in the path integral, only the light particles like a3
 will be left. the action obtained in this way
is called low energy eective action (below, simply called eective action) and the theory is said to

be in weak coupling region.

actually, the explicit form of the eective action is expected to be complicated due to quantum

uctuation, but because of the n = 2 supersymmetry this eective action(lagrangian) is known to

be simply represented by

are the u(1) multiplets and 3 etc are the third component of  etc. f (a) is a holomorphic function
called prepotential satisfying f (a)/a = 0, and its second order derivative

 =

2f (a)
a2

(3.3)

is called as eective coupling constant. the lowest order term of (3.3) is (2.5). furthermore, it is

convenient to introduce

especially, for a later purpose.

ad :=

f
a

,

(3.4)

note that the eective action is generated by the prepotential and once it is determined the

quantum dynamics of the particles will be claried. however, we are interested in the vacuum
conguration of the theory, so a can be replaced by its scalar component a. then f (a) reduces to
f (a) and in this case (3.4) is replaced by

ad :=

f
a

.

(3.5)

f (a) is a solution to the problem how to determine the low energy dynamics and the determination
of f (a) is the subject of the discussions below.

3.2 prepotential

in the classical theory, the prepotential is given by

fcl =

0
2

a2,

5

(3.6)

which is available from (2.5) and (3.3). on the other hand, perturbative part of the quantum

prepotential can be determined from the beta function for coupling constant.

in a gauge theory,

coupling constant is not simply a constant, but is a quantity receiving quantum corrections and is

determined by the beta function of renormalization group. in the case at hand, the beta function at

1-loop level is given by



dg
d

= ,  = bg3, b =

1
42 ,

(3.7)

where  is the renormalization scale, but since there is the non-renormalization theorem which sates

that there are not corrections beyond 1-loop in perturbation theory [8, 9], (3.7) exactly holds in this

sense. solving (3.7) by imposing the condition (g(a),  = a), one nds

where g = g() at . therefore,

3.3 instanton eect and prepotential

here, let us consider instantons and introduce the (euclidean) action of yang-mills elds

s = 

1

4g2 z d4xtr (ff ).

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

now, consider a conguration of gauge elds at innity (x  ). then f = 0 must be satised
at innity. this means that the gauge eld tends to an equivalent conguration to the vacuum.

the solution to classical equations of motion satisfying this condition is known as instanton solution.

with the aid of this instanton solution (3.13) becomes

s =

82
g2 ,

(3.14)

and therefore the amplitude of instanton of unit topological charge is given by es.

6

from (3.9) comparing the qcd parameter and the instanton amplitude, one nds that (/a)4k

corresponds to the amplitude of instanton with topological charge k (k-instanton)

(cid:18)
a(cid:19)4k

= e 82

g(a)2 k.

(3.15)

this factor is not proportional to powers in the coupling constant, therefore this can be considered

as non-perturbative eect.

seiberg [10] conjectured that for the actual prepotential these instantons contributed and its

form was predicted by

a2

 "ln

f = i

fk(cid:18)

a(cid:19)4k# .

xk=0

(3.16)

note that (3.16) takes the form of a sum of (3.6), (3.12) and instantons. f1 6= 0 was pointed by
seiberg [10], but it was not known whether general fk were 0 or not. however, seiberg and witten
[1, 2] showed that fk could be exactly determined by using data of a riemann surface.

3.4 strong coupling region

so far we have concentrated on the region |a|  , but next, let us consider the case of small
a. taking a to be small, one nds that a will arrive at the region |a|  . this corresponds to
u  2 in terms of moduli.
in this case, the analysis of the theory is very complicated, but
according to the detailed study of seiberg and witten [1, 2] it turned out that at u = +2 magnetic
monopole (a particle carrying only unit magnetic charge) becomes massless and at u = 2 dyon (a
particle carrying both electric and magnetic charges) becomes massless. this indicates that quantum
mechanically the moduli space has three singularities at u = 2 and . note that the classical
singularity disappears in the quantum theory.

in the description of the eective action presented in the previous (sub)sections, only the massless

gauge elds and their superpartners were concerned, but in the present case monopoles and dyons

must be taken into account. this indicates that the theory is in strongly coupled region and in

this region it is not easy to write down the eective action, but by using a notion of duality the

theory in this strong coupling region can be mapped to a weakly coupled dual theory. as a result,

it becomes possible to gain understandings on the original theory by studying weakly coupled dual

theory without directly treating the strongly coupled original theory. seiberg and witten [1, 2]

showed that this was in fact possible.

3.5 duality

according to seiberg and wittens result, the duality group (2) which is a subgroup of sl(2,z)

c d !(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(2) =(  a b

a  d  1 mod 2, b  c  0 mod 2)

(3.17)

7

is derived from the monodromy properties of a and ad at each singularity and then it acts for the
eective coupling constant which satises

as

im  > 0

a + b
c + d

,   a b

c d !  (2).

 

(3.18)

(3.19)

this fact implies that  is a modulus of riemann surface of genus one. from these consideration,

they conjectured the existence of a torus which satised this condition and identied the complex

u-plane with the quotient space h/(2) of the upper half plane h.

of course, it can be observed that one of the generators of (2)

s :   0

1 0 !

1

causes the exchange of a and ad

s :  =

dad
da  

1
dad
da

 d,

(3.20)

(3.21)

therefore the strong coupling region can be mapped to the weak coupling region of the theory having

d as the eective coupling constant.

4 the seiberg-witten solution

4.1 the su(2) case

searching whether a riemann surface which satises this property does exist or not, seiberg and

witten [1] found that it was given by

y2 = (x2  4)(x  u)

(4.1)

on local complex coordinates (x, y)  c2.

furthermore, if  is identied with the modulus of a riemann surface of genus one (torus), it

should be represented by a ratio of periods of a holomorphic 1-form dx/y along - and -cycles on

the torus. regarding a and ad as functions in u

one may insure that this implies

 =

dad/du
da/du

,

da
du

=i

dx
y

,

dx

.

8

(4.2)

(4.3)

accordingly, in this view point, a and ad can be interpreted as periods

where in the second equality the normalization factor is introduced. the 1-form sw obtained in this
way is usually referred to seiberg-witten dierential or seiberg-witten 1-form, and the approach

based on riemann surface is often called seiberg-witten solution or seiberg-witten theory.

4.2 other gauge group cases

in the case of classical lie gauge groups except su(2), it is known that the seiberg-witten curves

are written by hyperelliptic curves. the su(2) case is the only exception, and the seiberg-witten

curve can have two representations, i.e., elliptic and hyperelliptic types.

in the case not includ-

ing quark hypermultiplets, these curves and associated seiberg-witten dierentials are explicitly

represented as follows.

note that the normalization factors of seiberg-witten 1-forms are ignored in each case. the list used

here is that given in [16].

these hyperelliptic curves can be compactied to a riemann surface with appropriate genus

by adding an innity (see gure 1), and taking canonical (symplectic) 1-cycles on this surface and

denoting them as i and i, one sees that the seiberg-witten periods for a theory in gauge group g
can be written by

it is convenient to summarize these periods by

 is called period vector.

ai =ii

g, adi =ii

g.

(4.14)

(4.15)

figure 1: 1-cycles on an type seiberg-witten curve identied with genus n riemann surface

also in the case including quarks, similar hyperelliptic curves and seiberg-witten dierentials can

be constructed, but since the number of quarks which can be added is restricted from asymptotic

freedom and the form of the curve diers according to the number of quarks. for a later convenience,

let us write down the seiberg-witten curve and seiberg-witten dierential for the case of su(nc)
(nf < nc = n + 1) gauge group with nf quarks of mass mi (i = 1,   , nf ) [7, 17]

remark: also in the case of exceptional lie gauge groups, seiberg-witten curves are known to

be written in terms of hyperelliptic curves [18, 19, 20].

below, the sux of the qcd parameter is ignored, but this will not cause any confusion.

5 picard-fuchs equations

5.1 su(2) case

as an example, let us consider the periods in the su(2) gauge theory. these periods have been

introduced by (4.4), but in order to evaluate them it is necessary to explicitly express 1-cycles as

10

appropriate integral intervals. the simplest one to specify these intervals is to use branching points

of seiberg-witten curve as

 : 2  +2,  : +2  u

(5.1)

and to recognize these as loops running counterclockwise (but    = +1). actually, since the
evaluation of periods depends on the behavior of cycles, it is complicated to treat in general. for

example, considering the calculation of periods at weak coupling region, one nds that the qcd

parameter approaches to zero and u moves to the other branching point, so the torus collapses as

a result (see gure 2). therefore the period a ultimately reduced to an integral within innitesimal

interval near the origin, so the evaluation is easy, but since the dual period ad reduces to an integral
from 0 to , if under this situation ad is calculated, the integrand also diverges for u  , so that
ad nally involves logarithmical divergence. since we encounter such situation even if the gauge
group is any group, the calculation of dual period (in weak coupling region) is not easy in general.

figure 2: torus in the weak coupling region

then, how should we do? one of the simplest way to evaluate the periods is to realize these

periods as solutions to dierential equation. in fact, it can be shown that the derivatives are

(5.2)

where the 1-cycles (or their linear combinations) are summarized as  [5]. the second equation in

(5.2) indicates the existence of the dierential equation

d2
du2 +



4(u2  4)

(5.3)

with regular singularities and such equations are in general referred to picard-fuchs equation (for a

history of picard-fuchs equation, see [21]). note that the periods are now constructed as solutions

to dierential equation.

5.2 general case

even if the gauge group is any group, in order to derive picard-fuchs equations, it is sucient to

express parameter derivatives of period by another parameter derivatives. in fact, alishahiha wrote

11

the general form of picard-fuchs equations for all classical lie gauge groups [22]. for example, in

the case of su(n + 1) [5, 22], they are

(n + 1  i)sisn+1si+1#  = 0,

nxi=2

"(n + 1)s2sn

n+1  = 0,

(5.4)

of course, since the derivation of picard-fuchs equations is mechanical, some algorithms suitable

for computer program can be made. one day klemm et al.

[23] derived dierential equations in

landau-ginzburg model by using a method in singularity theory, but the algorithm of isidro et al.

[24] corresponds to the generalization of this construction by replacing the holomorphic 1-form by

seiberg-witten dierential on seiberg-witten curve.

5.3 hypergeometric dierential equations

picard-fuchs equations arising in this supersymmetric yang-mills theory are often identied

with well-known hypergeometric dierential systems. gaussian hypergeometric function (in multiple

variables) is the function which reduces to the single variable hypergeometric function 2f1 when
one of the variables is non-zero and the remainings are set to zero, and gaussian hypergeometric

dierential equations are the equations satised by such gaussian hypergeometric functions [25].

picard-fuchs equation of su(2) theory is given in (5.3), but for this equation performing the

transformation of variable

z = u2/4

one nds that (5.3) reduces to gausss hypergeometric equation [5]

(5.5)

(5.6)

on the other hand, in the case of the su(3) theory [5], picard-fuchs equations are represented by a

system of simultaneous partial dierential equations

[(276  4u3  27v2)2
[(276  4u3  27v2)2

u  12u2vuv  3uvv  u] = 0,
v  36uvuv  9vv  3] = 0,

(5.7)

where u  s2 and v  s3 are su(3) moduli, but this system is known to be equivalent to the two
variable hypergeometric system of appells f4 [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]

by the transformation of variables

x = 4u3/(276), y = v2/6.

(5.9)

x = x/x and y = y/y are euler partial derivatives.

as for the other rank two gauge groups, there is b2 = c2, whose picard-fuchs equations can be

recognized as horn h5 [30]. note that 2f1, f4 and h5 are all gaussian.

5.4 solutions to the picard-fuchs equation

let us consider solutions to the su(2) picard-fuchs equation (5.3) or (5.6) at weak coupling
region (u = ) [5]. according to frobeniuss method, it turns out that because of degeneracy of the
solutions to indicial equation the solutions involve logarithm (z = u2/4)

the next task is to relate these solutions to the periods, but is easily done by simply consider

appropriate linear combination of them. however, the combination must be uniquely xed by com-

puting lower order expansion of the periods. this manipulation is equivalent to give an initial

condition for the picard-fuchs equation. in this way, the result follows

6 prepotentials

6.1 the su(2) prepotential

let us derive the su(2) prepotential. the prepotential is a function in a and is available from

(3.5). however, since ad is obtained as a function in u, one must consider ad = ad(a) by eliminating
u from this as a rst step. this can be realized by inversely solving a = a(u) in (5.13)

u = 2a2 +

131072a10 +    .

(6.1)

next, after substituting this expression into (3.5), expanding it for large a and further integrating

it over a, one nds the prepotential [5]

where o(a)-terms including integration constant are ignored because they do not aect to the eective

coupling constant. the rst two coecients of the instanton expansion are given by

f1 =

64

, f2 =

5

32768

.

(6.3)

since f1 is f1  0.016, it is a number near 0 and also f2 is a very small number f2  0.00015.
from these values, the contributions from instantons are small quantities which may be ignored as

a matter of fact. nevertheless, they contributes non-zero eects. the calculation of these very small

but non-zero non-perturbative eects by using the methods in eld theory requires much labour,

but the point that gave a systematic method which can calculate such eect was one of the brilliant

success of seiberg and witten.

6.2 the case including quarks

so far we have considered pure yang-mills theory, that is, the theory not including quarks.

however, since qcd not including quarks is physically unnatural, let us consider the prepotential

with quarks.

again restricting the gauge group to su(2), one can see that quarks can be added up to three, pro-

vided the asymptotic freedom is preserved. seiberg and witten [2] conjectured that the prepotential

including nf massless quarks was given by

fnf =

ln(cid:18) a

xi=0

a2!(4nf )i ,

(6.4)

and the validity of this formula was later proved by ito and yang [31] (for the analysis of periods,

see [32]).

actually, since the masses of the quarks are expected to be non-zero, the prepotential in the

theory including quarks with masses mi is known to be modied to [33]

it is now easy to see the dependence of the masses of the quarks. (6.5) is complicated than (6.4), but
note that in (6.5) for mi  0 it reduces to (6.4), so (6.5) includes the seiberg and wittens formula
(6.4).

6.3 check

the prepotential has been obtained in this way, but does it really have eld theoretic meaning?

the calculation presented so far is based on the data of a riemann surface, but if it has a physical

meaning, the validity of it must be discussed by a method of eld theory. one can see that the

prepotential up to one-loop level certainly coincided with the result of perturbative calculus, but the

instanton eects, specically, its expansion coecients coincide with the value expected from eld

theory?

as a method to check this, there is a complicated method called instanton calculus and the

instanton contribution can be determined by this. however, since the actual calculation is very

complicated, explicit calculation is usually proceeded up to 2-instanton level, but at least up to this

level it is conrmed that the result based on riemann surface is not contradict to the instanton

calculus.

in this way, seiberg and wittens approach gained supports that it is correct also as a

physics [16, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40].

though once it was pointed out that there was a contradiction with the result of instanton calculus

in the case of su(2) with three quarks, this was resolved by admitting a linear transformation which

shifts moduli by qcd parameter [38, 39, 40]. the linear transformation mentioned here is to specify

where is the origin of the moduli space, so this is trivial in a sense, but note that in order to derive

instanton contribution to prepotential from seiberg-witten curve this shift is important. this kind

of discrepancy seems to admit generally for the hyperelliptic curves including quarks constructed so

far, in fact, also in the case of su(3) with four and ve quarks, it is observed by ewen and forger

that such constant shift of moduli is necessary to correctly include instanton eects [41].

moreover, when the gauge group is exceptional lie groups, it is known that there is a contradiction

between the results by hyperelliptic curves and by instanton calculus. in these cases, it is known that

if particular spectral curves, non-hyperelliptic curves often referred to square root type [42, 43, 44],

are regarded as seiberg-witten curves then the instanton contribution to the prepotentials from

these curves coincide with the instanton calculus [45, 46]. in this sense seiberg-witten curves should

be formulated by spectral curves of integrable system rather than hyperelliptic curves not only in

classical but also in exceptional gauge groups.

7 analytic continuation of period integrals

we have overviewed the theory of prepotential from the view point of picard-fuchs equation.

next, let us consider prepotentials from other standpoint.

15

7.1 period integrals

we have introduced picard-fuchs equations in order to remove the labour of direct evaluation of

periods because it is very intractable in general. as a matter of fact, it is sucient to obtain solutions

at regular singularities of picard-fuchs equations in order to study the behavior of periods at each

singularities on the moduli space, but in the method intermediated by picard-fuchs equations, since

the analysis depends on case by case such as su(2) or su(3), the derivation of general form of

instanton correction terms is not easy. however, for about 1-instanton level, it can be slightly easily

derived by using application of analytic continuation of period integrals [30, 47, 48, 49], although the

derivation of higher order instanton corrections in this method will not work well because of technical

problems. this approach was taken in the analysis of periods of calabi-yau manifolds, and the case

at hand can be regarded as a version of them.

let us consider the periods of su(nc) gauge theory as an example, but details are omitted here.
since the seiberg-witten curve is 2nc-order polynomial, it has 2nc zeros ei (branching points) on
x-plane. in the weak coupling region, expanding the seiberg-witten dierential around   0 and
then integrating it over i-cycle which enclose ei, then one gets

ai = ei +

(1/2)n2ncn

n!(2n)!

xn=1

  
ei!2n1 yk,k6=i

(ek  ei)2n.

(7.1)

the calculation over i-cycle dened in a similar way involves logarithmical divergence. then rewrit-
ing seiberg-witten dierential as

 = dxz i

i

ds
2i

(s)(s + 1/2)

2s(1/2)

ncyk=1
(x  ek)2s(2nc)s

(7.2)

and performing residue calculus over s = {0} n and integrating it over i-cycle, one nds that adi
is given by

i

 xk

(ei  ek) +

i ln 2

nc xk

(ai  ak)

(7.3)

adi =

2 xk

2nc

 (cid:19)2
(ai  ak) ln(cid:18)ei  ek

ql6=k(ek  el)2 .



1

rewriting this by aj and integrating it over the period, one can nd the 1-instanton contribution to
the prepotential and the result coincides with the instanton calculus.

this approach to get a general form of prepotential, in particular, the instanton correction part,

from period integrals was proceeded in [30, 47, 48, 49], but the most characteristic advantage of this

method was that the general form of prepotential could be derived both in weak and strong coupling

region without using picard-fuchs equations. dhoker et al. [48] determined the prepotentials based

on all classical lie gauge groups and the result showed the agreement with the instanton calculus.

furthermore, dhoker and phong [49] succeeded to give a formula of the prepotential in the strong

coupling region for the su(nc) gauge theories.

16

8 the scaling relation

it is well-known that the prepotential satises a very helpful homogeneous relation (euler equa-

tion) called scaling relation [50]. in this section, the basics of the scaling relation are discussed.

8.1 transformation rule of prepotential

firstly, let us see how the prepotential transforms under the action of (2) according to matone

[50]. we have already seen that the eective coupling constant transforms under the action of (2).

since the eective coupling constant is a second order derivative of the prepotential, this is equivalent

to

where ea = cad + d. the left hand side of (8.1) is written by ea, but by rewriting this by a, one nds

(8.4)

so from (8.1)

can be obtained. here, f  = 2
solution
ef (ea) = f (a) +

1
2

where c is the integration constant, but can be set to zero because the linear term concerning periods

does not contribute to the eective coupling constant. in this way, the transformation rule is obtained.

next, considering the quantity

g(a) = f 

a
2

f
a

,

(8.5)

one nds that g is invariant under the action of (2). accordingly, g is a modular invariant. g is a
function in a, but by regarding a = a(u) ( = d/du), it follows that

dg
du

=

(a

d).

(8.6)

now, look at the right hand side of (8.6). since it corresponds to the wronskian of the picard-

fuchs equation, it is actually a constant. to determine this constant, it is enough to substitute the

periods obtained by picard-fuchs equation (5.13) into this expression. thus,

therefore,

this is the scaling relation of prepotential.

(8.7)

(8.8)

remark: after the discovery of this relation by matone, it was checked that (8.8) holds exactly

in view of instanton calculus by fucito and travaglini [51].

17

8.2 other view points

after the discovery of matone the same scaling relation was rederived in various view points.

for example, there are the degree counting of the eective coupling constant [52], whitham theory

of soliton [53], anomalous superconformal ward identity [54] and direct derivation by picard-fuchs

equation [55].

here let us derive the scaling relation for su(nc) as an example. firstly, recall the seiberg-witten

curve given in (4.6). for the variables in this curve, associating degree (mass dimension)

deg (y) : deg (x) : deg (si) : deg () = n + 1 : 1 : i : 1

(8.9)

one can see that this curve is homogeneous. on the other hand, since the periods are determined

from seiberg-witten dierential, that the periods found to have degree 1 in a similar way.

accordingly, periods can be seen as a homogeneous function in moduli and qcd scale parameter,

and as a result the euler equations are derived to satisfy

ai =

ncxj=2

sj

ai
sj

+ 

ai


, adi =

ncxj=2

sj

+

.

(8.10)

since adi must be expressed by aj when we think of prepotential, and by interpreting adi =
adi(aj(sk, ), ) and using the second equation in (8.10) to the rst equation, one gets

adi =

ncxj=1

aj

adi
aj

+ 

adi


,

(8.11)

where / acts only the second argument of adi = (aj, ). substituting (3.5) into (8.11) and
further integrating it over ai, one gets

ncxi=1

ai

f
ai

+ 

f
  2f = 0,

(8.12)

where integration constants are ignored because it can be absorbed by redenition of prepotential.

(8.12) is the one known as scaling relation of prepotential.

actually, it is known that f / is proportional to the product of the coecient of 1-loop beta

function and the moduli [53], therefore in the case of su(2) the scaling relation is given by

aad  2f =

i


u,

(8.13)

which coincides with (8.8).

8.3 scaling relation including massive quarks

next, let us consider the scaling relation of prepotential of the case including quarks. according

to the result, in the case of su(nc) with nf quarks of mass mi, the prepotential satises

ai

(8.14)

but in the case that the masses are not all zero (8.14) does not give a simple relation between moduli,

quark masses and prepotential in contrast with the previous example. however, the right hand side

of (8.14) can be calculated by another method, and in the case of su(2) with nf = 1 massive quark
of mass m the scaling relation takes the form ( = d/du) [56]

8.4 examples of prepotentials obtained by scaling relation

in general, the calculation of prepotential in higher rank gauge group (with massive quarks) is

very complicated, but instanton coecients can be directly determined if the scaling relation is used.

the su(2) example is presented in appendix b. as for the other examples of prepotentials calculated

in this approach, there are: su(3) with quarks [41, 57], g2[45] and e6 [46].

9 wdvv equations and perspective

9.1 wdvv equations

we have seen that the prepotential satises a relation called scaling relation, but it also satises

another important relation. it is the witten-dijkgraaf-verlinde-verlinde (wdvv) equations, often

appears in two-dimensional topological eld theory [58].

in two-dimensional topological eld theory, the topological free energy f = f (t1,   , tn), where ti
are at coordinates, which is a generating function of correlation functions, has following properties.

for the third order derivative

cijk(t) :=

3f

titjtk ,

it satises

ij := c1ij(t) =

3f

t1titj

= constant, ij := (ij)1, ck

ij := klclij(t)

and from commutativity of the structure constant cijk(t), the wdvv equations follow

fijkklflmn = fnjkklflmi, fijk 

3f (t)
titjtk .

(9.1)

(9.2)

(9.3)

on the other hand, the wdvv equations in four-dimensional n = 2 yang-mills theory of

gauge group g look like (9.3) but take the form [59, 60, 61, 62]

(fi)(fk)1(fj) = (fj)(fk)1(fi), i, j, k = 1,   , rank(g),

(9.4)

19

where the symbols mean the matrix notation

(fi)jk =

3f

aiajak

.

(9.5)

marshakov et al.

[60, 61] pointed out that the wdvv equations in this form are satised by

not only the prepotentials in four-dimensional n = 2 yang-mills theories but also those in ve-
dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills theories of s1 compactication models. this indicates that
these two kinds of theories are simply one of solutions to the wdvv equations (9.4). accordingly,

the manipulation to get prepotential extensively stated in the previous sections was simply a labour

to obtain one of the solutions to (9.4)! for this reason, in order to gain understandings on these

supersymmetric yang-mills theories, it is necessary to study them in the frame work of wdvv

equations.

9.2 perspective

in view of wdvv equations, the low energy eective theory of four-dimensional supersymmetric

yang-mills theory seems to imply that it has a nature as a topological eld theory, but since this

eective theory is not necessary to be topological eld theory, it is interesting that the equations

(9.4) like (9.3) hold. however, it is not still turned out whether this eective theory can be really

interpreted as topological eld theory. moreover, the wdvv equations in this form is known to

widely hold also in the case including massive quarks, and in such case the masses of quarks are

regarded as if they are one of periods [61]. in this sense, the origin of the mass of the quarks may be

explained in the frame of topological eld theory.

nevertheless, since the meaning and importance of the role of (9.4) in this supersymmetric yang-

mills theory are not still claried, studying (9.4) in detail may provide something new aspect of

n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory.

a. other representation of picard-fuchs equations

usually in most cases, picard-fuchs equations are represented by using moduli derivatives, but

in the cases except su(2) are represented by a system of simultaneous partial dierential equations.

however, these picard-fuchs equations can be expressed into a more convenient form.

according to the result [63], it is better to make dierential equation by using qcd scale pa-

rameter. this is because seiberg-witten dierentials in any (classical) gauge group always take the

form

dk
dk =

polynomial in x

y

20

dx

(a.1)

and this quantity always representable by a linear combination of abelian dierentials [23], and

therefore summing up over various k produces ordinary dierential equation [63]. however, the

equation must have periods as independent solutions, so the order of the equation is the same with

the total number of periods.

let us cite the su(3) picard-fuchs ordinary dierential equation [63] for a reference. denoting

 54z(cid:16)4u3 + 27v2(cid:17)(cid:21) .

at rst sight, this ordinary dierential system seems to be more complicated than the original

su(3) picard-fuchs system (5.8), but it has an advantage that the solutions take a convenient form.

the moduli space of the su(2) theory can be interpreted as a riemann sphere with three singu-

larities (after suitable compactication), but that of the su(3) theory can be seen as the complex
projective space cp 2 [5], which can be covered by the three coordinate neighborhood

p1 :   4u3

2712 : 1! , p2 :   4u3

v2 : 1 :

2712

v2 ! , p3 :  1 :

(276)2

4u3 ! .

(a.6)

we can choose p2 and p3 as weak coupling region. we faced on a similar situation when we discussed
the mirror symmetry of calabi-yau manifold with several complex structure moduli. there, how to

choose the large radius limit was a problem, so some people might remember this. in the case at

hand, there are two choices, but in view of qcd parameter both p2 and p3 can be thought to be in
the region   0. thus the solutions to (a.2) give common basis on these two coordinates.

21

b. application of scaling relation

since the scaling relation is simply an euler equation, it is not so interesting at rst sight, but

let us show that this relation is very useful by taking a derivation of the su(2) prepotential as an

example [50].

firstly, let us recall that the prepotential was determined by calculating the periods by picard-

fuchs equation. in that calculation, the period a was a function in the moduli u, but u was nally

represented by a. what happens, if this calculation is applied to picard-fuchs equation (5.3)? (5.3)
is written by u derivative of a, but regarding u as a function in a, i.e., u = u(a), one nds ( = d/da)

=  du

da!1

da
du

= u

1,

d2a
du2 = u

3u



.

(b.1)

substituting this into (5.3), one can arrive at the cerebrated matones dierential equation [50]

this equation enables to determine u as a function in a, if u is solved over a (6.1)

4(4  u2)u



+ au

3 = 0.

u =

xi=0

fia24i,

(b.2)

(b.3)

where the expansion coecients are denoted by fi with f0 = 2.

here, let us recall the scaling relation (8.8). since up to 1-loop level prepotential can be determined

from perturbation theory, this part may be thought as already known, although the general form

of prepotential is always written in the form (classical)+(1-loop)+(instantons). for this, regarding

only the instanton expansion coecients are unknowns and setting

f = i

a2

 "ln(cid:18) a
(cid:19)2



xi=0 fi(cid:18)

a(cid:19)4i#

and substituting this and (b.3) into (8.8), one nds

fk = 4kfk.

(b.4)

(b.5)

as was already stated, the calculation of ad is very complicated, but this method directly determine
the expansion coecients.

moreover, since (8.8) directly relates the moduli and prepotential, the dierential equation satis-

ed by prepotential

f

(af   f )3

is available, provided u of (b.2) is substituted into u of (8.8).

remark: the method of scaling relation played an important role also in the proof [55] of

nekrasovs insist that states the seiberg-witten theory can be obtained from a circle compactication

of ve-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills theory [64].
