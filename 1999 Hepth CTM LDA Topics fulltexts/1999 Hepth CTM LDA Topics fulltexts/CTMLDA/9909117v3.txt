abstract

the extended yang-mills gauge theory in euclidean space is a renormalizable
(by power counting) gauge theory describing a local interacting theory of scalar,
vector, and tensor gauge elds (with maximum spin 2). in this article we study
the quantum aspects and various generalizations of this model in euclidean
space. in particular the quantization of the pure gauge model in a common
class of covariant gauges is performed. we generalize the pure gauge sector
by including matter fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group
and analyze its n=1 and n=2 supersymmetric extensions. we show that the
maximum half-integer spin contained in these fermion elds in dimension 4 is
3/2. moreover we develop an extension of this theory so as to include internal
gauge symmetries and the coupling to bosonic matter elds. the spontaneous
symmetry breaking of the extended gauge symmetry is also analyzed.

1 introduction

the interacting theories of higher spin elds [1] have attracted a great attention
mostly because of the relevant role played by the spin-2 eld graviton which, it is well
known, should couple to any kind of particle. there is no doubt about the existence of
higher spin composite particles in nature, a classical example is given by the observed
hadronic resonances. however, up to now, no elementary particle with spin higher
than 1 has been observed (among these the graviton).

the main theoretical problems which aect the construction of a consistent inter-
acting theory of elementary higher spin elds [2] in minkowski space can be briey
summarized as follows: one must require the cancellation of all negative-norm states,
a cancellation which is performed by means of higher-spin gauge invariances. these
local invariances, though, impose too many restrictions (on the interacting terms)
which cannot be satised in many circumstances. these restrictions can be circum-
vented by relaxing some basic requirements of quantum eld theory. indeed a general
class of consistent interacting higher-spin gauge theories in dimension 4,3, and 2 exists
and describes innitely many elds containing all the spins [3]. in the formulation
of these theories, though, in order to implement the gauge symmetries, necessary to
eliminate all the negative norm states, innitely many auxiliary elds must be intro-
duced. this mechanism induces higher derivatives in the interaction terms and these
in turn give rise to non-locality [1]. these theories are of interest, however, since
they also establish a connection with string models, even though in the latter all the
elementary higher spin excitations beyond the graviton are massive [4].

up to now in minkowski space, the only consistent local interacting eld theories of
massless spin higher than 1/2 are the usual abelian and non-abelian yang-mills (ym)
gauge theories for the spin-1 [5], the gravity for the spin-2 [6], and the supergravity
theories [7] for both the spin-2 and spin-3/2. in addition if one requires these theories
to be also renormalizable then the above list would further shorten since it does not
contain the gravitational interactions. at present string theories, where gravity is
consistently coupled to matter and gauge elds of any spin [4], are largely believed
to play a central role in the solution of all these problems.

in this paper we analyze a gauge theory of higher spin interactions in a at eu-
clidean space-time. in this space, in fact, we shall see that it is possible to construct
a general class of renormalizable higher spin gauge theories. this theory was rst
introduced a number of years ago in [8] where an extension to the abelian gauge
theory with scalar, vector, and tensor gauge elds was proposed in euclidean space.
this model is described (in a 4dimensional at space-time) by a non-abelian u(4)
gauge theory of the yms type where the connection eld takes values in the usual

3

cliord algebra of spinors. here the scalar, vector, and tensor elds can be identied
as the components of the gauge connection along the cliord algebra basis. in four
dimensions the content of the maximum spin of the gauge multiplet is a spin-2 and the
full interacting lagrangian is renormalizable by power counting. this model, in the
full basis of cliord algebra, contains three spin-2 elds: two of them are in a stan-
dard representation of the rotation group and are described by a symmetric traceless
tensor of rank two, whereas the remaining one is contained in one of the irreducible
representations of a tensor of rank-3 with two antisymmetric indices [8]-[10].

an interesting aspect of this model is that the gauge transformations mix, in a
consistent way, dierent irreducible representations of the space-time rotation group.
here the gauge spin-2 elds do not have the usual coupling to the energy momen-
tum tensor while they do couple to the lowest spin particles in a consistent way. 2
moreover the free gauge transformations of the standard spin-2 elds coincide with
the usual spin-2 gauge transformations of the fierz-pauli eld [11].
a controversial question is the analytical continuation of this theory to the minkowski
space. we next recall some problems related to this issue that are still open. since
the elements of the gauge group are not invariant under the lorentz transformations,
the question whether or not the model in [8] is forbidden by the colemanmandula
nogo theorem [12] might arise. as pointed out in ref.[10], the model in [8] circum-
vents the hypothesis of [12]. the main reason for this is that the theorem in [12]
applies only to the global symmetries of the s matrix and does not deal with the
local symmetries of the lagrangian (see ref.[13] for a detailed discussion on this is-
sue). moreover, since the present theory is of the yms type, we should expect the
connement phenomenon to arise. if so, then the physical spectrum will be described
by gauge invariant operators, such as for example the hadron states or glueballs in
qcd, and this symmetry will not be manifest in the s matrix of the physical states.
however we stress that, in this model, one of the main statements of the coleman
mandula theorem, which is the analytical behavior of the s matrix, can be directly
checked in perturbation theory. in particular one can verify (by means of the analogy
with the gluon scatterings) that, in the pure yangmills sector, the treelevel gauge
invariant amplitudes satisfy all the analytical requirements [14].
this theory is well formulated in an euclidean space where the gauge group is compact
and, being a yms type gauge theory, it should satisfy also the osterwalder-schrader
axioms [15]. therefore it is possible to quantize it by means of the standard path
integral method applied to gauge theories. however, when this theory is formulated

2we will see that the standard spin-2 elds appearing in this model cannot be identied with

standard graviton eld, at least in the weak coupling limit.

4

directly into a minkowski space (where the gauge group is noncompact), problems
with unitarity of the s matrix might arise because of unwanted ghost states [8],[10].
nevertheless we stress that the appearance of an indenite metrics in the hilbert
space, due the noncompactness of the symmetry group, is not always an obstacle
for building a consistent theory [16][19]. a pioneering study in this direction was
started by lee and wick in ref.[16]. moreover in the literature various noncompact
sigma-models with indenite metrics also appear in some extended supergravities
when the reduction to four dimension is considered [17]. the general conclusion for
these models is that a unitary s matrix in the physical subspace can be obtained
from a pseudo-unitary s-matrix in the full hilbert space [17], [18].
in the present model the analysis of unitarity is a more complicated issue than in the
noncompact sigmamodels, mainly because the symmetry is local and it is not an
internal one. a careful analysis of the unitarity of the s matrix (in minkowski space)
is still missing for this theory and it would be worth investigating how the unphys-
ical ghost sector could decouple from the physical amplitudes. the clarication of
this problem could be helpful for understanding the relation between unitarity and
renormalizability of the spin-2 eld interactions in minkowski space. however in the
present paper we do not tackle the issue of unitarity and restrict ourselves to the
euclidean space where the gauge group is compact and the theory is consistent.

recently in ref.[10] an interesting proposal to include fermions in the model in[8]
has been given. whereas in ref.[10] only the sub-group so(4) is considered, in this
article we shall see that it is straightforward to extend these fermion couplings to
the larger group u(4) which was rst considered in ref.[8]. moreover in this work we
generalize the model in [8] to its n=1 and n=2 euclidean supersymmetric extensions.
the paper is organized as follows. in section [2] we briey recall the model pro-
posed in ref.[8] and analyze the free particle spectrum. in section [3] we quantize
this model in a covariant gauge and give the expression for the ghost lagrangian. in
section [4], by following the approach of ref.[10], we generalize the model in [8] by
including fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and analyze its
supersymmetric extensions.
in section [5] we extend the model in [8] so as to in-
clude the standard internal gauge symmetries. the expression for the unied gauge
lagrangian, which includes the internal su(n) gauge group, is given, together with
the corresponding innitesimal gauge transformations, in appendix. in section [6] we
study the coupling of the extended gauge elds with bosonic matter elds and make
some remarks on possible couplings with ordinary matter and gauge elds. in section
[7], the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the extended gauge symmetry is analyzed.
finally the last section is devoted to our conclusions.

2 pure gauge action

in the model proposed in ref.[8] the usual abelian gauge transformations have been
extended to non-abelian ones which mix elds of dierent integer spin. as a con-
sequence the elements of the gauge group transform non-trivially under coordinate
rotations. in addition the lagrangian, which is invariant under these extended gauge
transformations, describes a local interacting gauge theory of higher spin elds. this
model has the attractive feature that it is renormalizable by power counting. (due to
the gauge invariance, we believe that the model is also fully renormalizable, however
we do not tackle this issue in the present article.) moreover another interesting char-
acteristic is that the maximum value of the spin contents (s) of the gauge multiplet
is xed by the space-time dimension d; in particular for d = 4 we have s = 2.

before presenting our analysis we briey recall the model proposed in ref.[8]. one
rst considers a spinorial-vectorial eld aij
 (x) in euclidean four dimensional space,
where i and j are indices which belong to the dirac spinorial space (i, j = 1, . . . , 4). in
particular this eld is dened to transform under the euclidean coordinate rotation3

x  x =  

 x, with 

 

 = 



a(x)  a(x) = s() a(x)s1() 
 .

(1)

(2)

as follows

note that in (2) s() is the usual spinorial representation of the rotation group o(4)
which is given by

s() = exp (


4

), with s()s1() = 

,

(3)

where  is a function 4 of ,  = [, ]/2, and  are the usual dirac matrices
satisfying the relation {, } = 2. in ref.[8] it was pointed out that it is very
useful to decompose the eld a along the cliord algebra basis; this is done in the
following manner

a(x) = a(x)1i + a(x)5 + t(x) + t(x)5 + c(x)


2

,

(4)

where 1i is the unity matrix in the cliord algebra. indeed in this decomposition
the indices of the elds which label the cliord algebra basis are vectorial indices

3 we use the convention to sum up the same indices and the euclidean metric is given by

 = 

 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1).

4in the case of innitesimal transformations we have  =  +  +o(2), with  = 

the exact relationship between  and  can be found, for example, in ref. [20].

under o(4) rotations (the reader can easily check this property by means of eqs.(2)
and (3)). this implies that the elds a, t (and analogously t ) and c,
respectively, transform as a vector and tensors of rank 2 and 3.
it is worth observing that some components of a, namely t, t, and c, can
be further decomposed in irreducible representation of o(4) as follows

t =

where  is the complete antisymmetric tensor. we now give some clarications
about the elds appearing in eq.(5):  and  are scalars, b and b are vectors
while s is a symmetric traceless tensor of rank-2. the elds v s
 (and
analogously v s,a
 ) are antisymmetric tensors in the (1,0) and (0,1) representations,
respectively. (note that with the notation (x,y) we refer to the usual su(2)  su(2)
complex spinorial representation of the rotation group o(4) [21].) the tensor elds
ds
 and da
 belong to the (3/2, 1) and (1, 3/2) representations respectively; they
are antisymmetric in the ,  indices and are traceless. moreover v (s,a)
and d(s,a)
satisfy the following self-duality conditions [10]

 and v a

(6)

where the signs (+) and () refer to (s) and (a) respectively.5
we now see that, by using the self-duality conditions (6), the d(s,a)
tensor
elds have 8 and 3 degrees of freedom, respectively. note that, if the elds are
massive[22], a spin-2 eld is contained in each of the tensors s, s and d(s,a)
 . on
the contrary, if the spin-2 elds are massless, according to the weinberg theorem[22]
only the left-handed and right-handed polarizations are consistently described by the

 and v (s,a)



5we recall that in minkowski space it is not possible to impose self-dual (or antiself-dual) condi-
tions on real elds. the self- (or antiself) duality conditions can be imposed only on complex elds.
therefore in minkowski space each combination v s

, which appear in eq.(5), are replaced by only one irreducible eld representation.

that a massless spin-2 can be described by the reducible eld d = ds

 elds, respectively. therefore, if parity is conserved, one may conclude
.
returning to the model in [8], the succeeding step is to promote the eld a to a
gauge connection by requiring that a transforms under a local gauge transformation
u(x) as follows

 + da

ag

 (x) = u(x) a(x)u1(x) +

g

u(x)u1(x),

(7)

where u(x), which belongs to u(4), acts on the spinorial indices of a. in [8] it is
required that the new gauge eld ag
 should transform, under coordinate rotations,
as a in eq.(2). because of this requirement the transformation (under coordinate
rotations) properties of u(x)

u(x) = s()u(x)s1()

(8)

also follow.
now by means of the exponential representation one can express u(x) as follows

u(x) = exp {(x)},

where

(x) = (x)1i + (x)5 + (x) + (x)5 + (x)

(9)

.

note that the indices which label the basis in eq.(10), due to the transformation
in (8) and eq.(3), transform as vectorial indices under coordinate rotations. finally
the compact expression of the lagrangian le, which is invariant under the gauge
transformations (7), is given by

le(x) =
f(x) =  a   a + g[ a, a],

(11)

where in the above expression the commutator and the trace are taken on the cliord
algebra. by using the component elds given in (4), the lagrangian in (11) takes the
following form

le = l0 + gl1 + g2l2,

clearly the a is a free eld since it corresponds to the u(1) gauge connection of
u(4) and the interacting theory is described by the su(4) gauge group. note that
the smallest sub-algebra of su(4) is given by the  generators which belong to the
algebra of so(4). the smallest gauge lagrangian, which is invariant under the so(4)
gauge transformations, is given by the terms in (13-15) containing only the c eld.
the latter was considered in ref.[10].

one interesting aspect of this model is that the lagrangian (12) can be written
in terms of the o(4) irreducible representations by inserting the elds decomposition
(5) in the expressions (13)-(15) (see [8]). then the corresponding innitesimal gauge
transformations for the irreducible elds are obtained by means of the standard de-
composition method, as previously shown in eq.(16). for example, the corresponding
innitesimal gauge transformations for , s, v (s,a)

are given by

(17)

with the obvious generalization for the other elds. the expression for the lagrangian
containing only the c eld, in terms of the irreducible representation, can be found
in ref.[10].

we here analyze the physical degrees of freedom and the free particle spectrum
of the model introduced in [8].
in order to do so we restrict our analysis by only
considering the free lagrangian l0 which is invariant under the abelian sector6 of the
gauge transformations. we rst consider7 the free lagrangian l0(t ) in eq.(13) which
contains only the tensor eld t. from eq.(16) we see that it is possible to make a
gauge transformation which ensures

s = 0 and  = 0.

(18)

this result is justied in the following manner. the free gauge transformations for
the eld s = s + 1/4 are given by  s =  + . then, by means
of these gauge transformations, the rst constraint in (18) can be imposed. this
constraint, when the on-shell massless equations for s and  are used, is invariant
under a new gauge transformation. this new gauge degree of freedom allows us to

6by abelian sector of the gauge transformations we mean the non-homogeneous terms in eq.(16)

containing only the derivatives.

7 in this analysis we do not consider the free particle spectrum described by the elds a and

a since it is clear from (13) that they describe two massless spin-1 elds.

eliminate the component of the on-shell massless scalar eld . (note that the gauge
transformations for the eld s and the gauge xing in (18) are the same ones en-
countered in the spin-2 eld of the fierz-pauli lagrangian.) by adopting the gauge
xing (18) all the gauge degrees of freedom are used and no new constraint on t
can be imposed. in particular no constraint may be introduced for the antisymmetric
tensor eld t a
 = v s
now if the elds v (s,a)
, in the (1,0) and (0,1) representation elds, were massive then
they would describe two spin-1 elds. however since they are massless elds, accord-
ing to the weinberg theorem [22], only one massless spin-1 eld can be associated
to the (1, 0) (0, 1) representation, where the right- and left-handed polarization are
contained in the (1,0) and (0,1) representation, respectively. here the two residual
degrees of freedom are contained in the longitudinal components. these degrees are
associated to the transverse polarizations of the vectorial eld l  t . indeed
these polarizations cannot be gauged out in this model. the only components of the
reducible tensor t which can be gauged out correspond to the vector t .



as a consequence the physical polarizations of the eld t, in the momentum
space k, are the transverse ones t (s)
(k) (where (s) and (a) refer to
the symmetric and antisymmetric tensor in  and , respectively) and longitudinal
ones l

(k) which satisfy the following conditions

(k) and t (a)





kt (a)



(k) = 0,

kt (s)



(k) = 0,

kl

(k) = 0,

(19)



 has not a denite symmetry in ,  and kl
(k) and t (a)

note that in the above relations l
(k) 6=
0. from eq.(19) we have t (s)
(k) each contain only two independent
polarizations. on the contrary in l
 there are four independent polarizations, each
of which correspond to one massless spin-1 and two massless spin-0. as a result the
on-shell t eld describes the following spectrum: one massless spin-2, two massless
spin-1, and two massless spin-0. therefore in total we count 3  2 + 2  1 = 8
degrees of freedom for the on-shell t eld; this result is in agreement with the naive
counting based on the gauge degrees of freedom.



we next analyze the particle spectrum described by the free lagrangian l0(c) in
eq.(13) which contains only the eld c. we can use the gauge degrees of freedom

in order to set the following transversality constraints on the elds d(s,a)



c  c + 

d(s,a)

 = 0.

11

(20)

(21)

the results in ref.[22] enable us to see that in the massless case the d(s)
 which sat-
ises eq.(21) describes two degrees of freedom. these degrees of freedom correspond
to a right-handed spin-2 and a right-handed spin-1 eld. analogously we can see that
the d(a)
 describes the corresponding left-handed ones. therefore, since in this model
parity is conserved, the physical polarizations of the reducible eld d(s)
 will
describe a massless spin-2 and spin-1 eld.

 + d(a)

as a result of the gauge-xing in (21) there are no gauge degrees of freedom
available which would enable us to eliminate other components in the vector elds b
and b. thus the eld b contains 4 independent polarizations. the two transverse
one (respect to the three-momentum) correspond to a massless spin-one polarizations
whereas the longitudinal ones are associated with massless spin-0 elds. the spectrum
for b is obtained analogously. as a result the on-shell c eld describes the
following massless spectrum: one spin-2, three spin-1, and four spin-0 elds; so in
total we count respectively 4  2 + 4  1 = 12 degrees of freedom, in agreement
with the naive counting based on the gauge degrees of freedom.
it is clear that the on-shell particle contents of this model is gauge invariant and
one can reach the same conclusions on the spectrum by using dierent choices for
the gauge xing. finally we note that the spin-0 particles (or longitudinal photons)
which appear in the spectrum are strictly connected to the fact that some longitudinal
components of the tensor or vector elds can not be gauged out.

3 covariant quantization

when the model in [8] is quantized in the euclidean space the negative norm states
are absent since the space-time metric is the  and the gauge group is compact.
moreover, due to the compactness of the gauge group, the theory can be quantized
by means of the standard path integral method. clearly the fact that the theory is well
dened in euclidean space it is not enough to guarantee its analytical continuation to
the minkowski one. even if the osterwalder-schrader (os) axioms are satised, and
in particular the property of reection positivity [15] is veried, one cannot use here
the reconstruction theorems 8 of ref.[15]. indeed, in the proof of these theorems, the
gauge group is not changed by the analytical continuation to the minkowski space.
on the contrary in the model in [8], in order to maintain the lorentz covariance,
we must rotate the gauge group u(4) to the non-compact one u(2, 2) when the

8 these theorems guarantee that the wightman functions (which satisfy the wightman axioms)
can be completely reconstructed from the analytical continuation of the corresponding schwinger
functions, provided that these last one satisfy the axioms in [15].

12

analytical continuation to minkowski space is performed. however, as we discussed
in the introduction, the presence of extra negativenorm states (induced by the non
compact groups) is not always an obstacle for building a consistent theory [16][19].
in particular, for this model, it should be interesting to see if a lorentz invariant
hilbert subspace, where the theory is unitary and the unphysical states decouple
from the physical amplitudes, exists. however in present paper we do not tackle the
issue of unitarity in minkowski space.

now we analyze the covariant quantization of this model in the most common
class of covariant gauges. in euclidean space the path integral representation of the
generating functional of the green functions w [j] can be formally written as

w [j] = z d ad d  exp(cid:26)z d4x(cid:16)le + lgf + lgh  t r( j a)(cid:17)(cid:27) ,

(22)

where le is the full lagrangian given in eq.(12) and lgf and lgh correspond to
the gauge-xing and the ghost lagrangian, respectively. in the last term the trace is
taken on the cliord algebra and j, which can be decomposed as a in eq.(4), is
the source for the gauge eld a.

in the present study we consider the general class of covariant gauges whose gauge

xing lagrangian is given by

lgf =

1
8

t rh( a)2i

(23)

we restrict our analysis by considering only the interacting theory given by the su(4)
gauge group. in this gauge the free propagators pab (in momentum space k) for the
elds a, t, t  and c are given by

p( a a ) =

p(tt ) =

(24)

the propagators in the basis of the o(4) irreducible representations can be easily
obtained from eqs.(24) by means of the standard decomposition methods. note
that the propagators in eqs.(24) are diagonal in the basis of the o(4) irreducible

13

representations only in the thooft-feynman gauge  = 1. however for practical
calculations, such as the scattering amplitudes, it is more convenient to work with
the propagators in the basis of the reducible elds t, t  and c instead of the
irreducible ones.

for completeness we give the expression of the following ghost lagrangian associ-

ated with the gauge xing in (23)

the ghost multiplet, which appears in eqs.(26), is composed by the following elds: a
complex scalar , two complex vectors , , and a complex antisymmetric tensor ,
all of which are grassman variables. note that vectorial ghost elds always appear
when gauge spin-2 elds are present, a classical example is the quantum gravity.

it is worth noting that, although the physical spectrum should be described in
terms of elds which belong to the o(4) irreducible representations, the renormal-
ization properties of the lagrangian (12) can be directly analyzed by means of the
o(4) reducible eld basis ( a, t, t , c) dened in (4). indeed in this basis and in the
covariant gauge (23), the renormalizability of the lagrangian (12) is apparent.
in
particular, in terms of the o(4) reducible elds, this lagrangian is equivalent to a
standard yms one with a particular gauge group. therefore the standard results on
the renormalizability of the ym theories should also hold for this model.

now we briey discuss the gauge-invariant regularization. due to the presence of
the 5 matrix (which does not exist in odd dimensions) in the gauge cliord algebra
basis, it is clear that the usual dimensional-regularization is not particularly suitable
for this model. in order to solve this problem, in ref.[10] it is suggested to adopt
the operator regularization scheme [23]. here we want to point out that there exists
another possible su(4) gauge invariant regularization scheme, which is also non
perturbative, for this theory: this is provided by means of the corresponding wilson
action on the lattice [24]. indeed on the lattice the cliord algebra basis is taken

14

in 4 dimensions and the above mentioned problem of 5 does not exist. moreover,
even though the fermions matter elds are coupled to the gauge connection, the lattice
regularization does not spoil the su(4) gauge symmetry. indeed, as we will show later
on, the generator corresponding to the gauge transformation containing the 5 matrix
is not connected to the standard chiral transformations and so the wilson term,
which is necessary to solve the doubling problem, does respect the gauge symmetry.
clearly, when fermions are added to the theory, the wilson term breaks the (global)
standard chiral symmetry.

4 supersymmetric extension

in this section we consider the couplings of the gauge eld a to fermion matter
elds which are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. in ref. [10] these
couplings have been proposed, and the smallest gauge sub-group so(4) studied. we
generalize this approach by considering the larger group su(4). moreover we derive
the n=1 and n=2 supersymmetric extensions of the pure gauge action (12).

in order to introduce these fermion couplings we follow the method developed in
ref.[10]. we dene in euclidean space the following fermion multiplet ij
k where the
up indices i, j and the down index k are the usual dirac indices. before giving the
coordinate transformation rules of ij
k some denitions are in order. in addition to
the spinorial representation of the o(4) rotation group, namely s(), we introduce
another independent spinorial representation of this group that we will call s().
the matrix s(), in terms of a new cliord algebra basis

i = 1i, 5, , 5, 5, ,

(27)

(where 1i is the unity matrix) is assumed to commute with s() and to have the
same representation as s() (see eq.(3) ). note that each element of the i basis is
assumed to commute with any other element of the cliord i basis.

now we can dene the following coordinate transformation properties of ij

k in

euclidean space, these are

ij
k (x)   ij

 x,

x  x =  
k (x) = (cid:16) s()(cid:17)km(cid:26)(s())ia ab

m(x)(cid:16)s1()(cid:17)bj(cid:27)

or in a more compact notation

(x)  (x) = s()ns() (x)s1()o

15

(28)

(29)

and analogously for the adjoint eld



(x) 

(x) = ns()

(x)s1()o s1(),

(30)

where the multiplication of s() and s() matrices acts on the up and down dirac
indices, respectively. note that the s() matrix in eq.(29) is the same matrix ap-
pearing in the coordinate transformation rule of the gauge potential in eq.(2). we
now decompose the eld  on the same basis i of the a eld as follows

jk

i = i(5)jk + 

i ()jk + 

5i (5)jk + 

i

()jk

2

.

(31)

in the sequel the notation for the spinorial down index i in the component elds,
appearing in (31), will be suppressed. as a consequence of the coordinate transfor-
mations (29), the component elds ,  (or analogously 5), and  transform in
the following manner

s(),

there  (respectively  and ) transform as a spin-1/2 a (respectively spin-3/2)
eld.

it is interesting to observe that the fermion elds 

i and 

i

can be decomposed

into irreducible representations of the o(4) coordinate transformations as follows 9

16

the elds , 5,  , ( resp. , 
5 , , ) describe spin-1/2 (respectively spin-3/2)
elds. by means of eq.(32) it is straightforward to prove that the decompositions
(33) are o(4) irreducible.

in order to couple the eld  to the gauge connection a we need to require that,
, transform as

follows

where, as usual, the sum over repeated indices is understood. as a result the covariant
derivative d acting on  is given by

(35)

(36)

d  =    gh , ai ,

where the commutator is taken on the i cliord algebra basis and g is the same
coupling appearing in the lagrangian (12).

we now analyze the n=1 and n=2 supersymmetric extensions of the action (12),
by rst recalling the known technical solutions for constructing supersymmetric the-
ories in euclidean space.
in the fourspinor formalism, n=1 supersymmetry (susy) requires the existence of
majorana fermions. however the majorana reality condition  = c t (where c is
the charge conjugation matrix,  is the adjoint of , and the sux t stands for trans-
pose) is inconsistent in euclidean space [21], [25].10 this is apparently a technical,
but not fundamental diculty to implement supersymmetry in euclidean space.11
in the n=1 supersymmetric ym (sym) theory in euclidean space, by means of a
special denition for euclidean majorana spinors [26], [27], supersymmetry can be
restored at the price of giving up the hermiticity of the action. then, by construction,

10 this can be simply understood by means of the so(4) coordinate transformation properties
of the weyl spinors l, r in which a four-spinor  can be decomposed, namely  = (l, r):
in euclidean space the l and r transform independently under so(4), and so they can not be
related by complex conjugation as in the relativistic theory. this is connected to the fact that, due
to the compactness of the euclidean so(4) rotational group, the generators of the two su (2) groups
associated to so(4), are completely independent, while for the lorentz group they are connected
by charge conjugation. therefore real four-spinor elds can not exist in euclidean space.

11 for instance, one can always impose simplectic majorana conditions (1) = c (2)t, (2) =
c t(1), by means of two independent four-spinors (1) and (2), where (1), (2) are the
corresponding adjoint ones.

17

the expectation values (schwinger functions), generated by the euclidean supersym-
metric model, are the analytical continuations of the corresponding green functions
in minkowski space [26]. indeed, as observed in ref.
[26], in euclidean space the
relevant notion is not hermiticity, but rather osterwalder-schrader reection posi-
tivity [15] which guarantees the above mentioned analytical continuation. moreover
the euclidean n=1 susy transformations are not hermitean. however this is not a
problem, since the susy transformations are just a formal device in order to obtain
susy ward identities [26].

in an other approach, proposed by zumino [28], the hermiticity of the action
is retained at the price of giving up the explicit connection between relativistic and
euclidean eld theory. in particular in the zumino model [28] the number of fermionic
degrees of freedom is doubled (with respect to n=1 sym) in order to get an hermitean
action, but additional bosonic (scalar) matter elds should be added to the n=1
sym action in order to restore the balance between fermionic and bosonic degrees of
freedom. as a consequence the zumino model is an n=2 sym theory and therefore
the analytical continuation with the relativistic n=1 sym theory is lost.

we start our analysis with the n=1 susy extension of the lagrangian (12). paral-
leling the technique developed in rst reference of [26], the rst step is to introduce, in
addition to the complex eld  in eq.(31), a completely independent (complex) eld
 which transforms as the adjoint of  in eq.(30). the expression of
 in components
is given by

jk


i = i(5)jk + 

i ()jk + 

5i (5)jk + 

i

( )jk

2

.

(37)

the next step consists in imposing the following majoranalike conditions on the
component elds of

 and , namely
  c t,   c t

, 5  c t

5,   c t



(38)

where t stands for transpose, c (the charge conjugation matrix) is dened as cc =
1 and c1 = c, and the standard spinorial multiplication between c and the
fermion elds a or a is understood. note that the above relations (38) can be now
consistently satised since a 6= a0. in other words, eqs.(38) are just denitions
for the elds a [26]. then, in order to implement the analytical continuation to
minkowski space, one should require that a are euclidean majorana spinors, whose
formal denition can be found in the rst reference of [26].12

12 we recall that the euclidean majorana spinors (which are complex four-spinors) are by def-
inition those operators in euclidean fock space which generate the analytical continuation of the
corresponding wightman functions of the relativistic theory [26].

finally the o(4)gaugeinvariant lagrangian lf for the fermion sector is given by

lf =

8 nt r(cid:16) (cid:17)  gt r(cid:16)h , ai(cid:17)o ,

in deriving eq.(40), the following majorana relations for anticommuting elds a have
been used

ab = ba,

ab = ba
where in eqs.(40) and (41), the denitions (38) (or equivalently a  t
ac) are un-
derstood. then, due to the fact that the lagrangian in eq.(40) does not depend on
the adjoint elds a (or analogously a), the hermiticity is lost [26].

these transformations, together with the corresponding ones for the gauge elds (16),
leave invariant the lagrangian lf .

we now give the results for the euclidean lagrangian lsu sy

(up to a total derivative) under the n=1 (o-shell) susy transformations

13 note that in eq.(40) we have eliminated from the notation the bar over the  matrices since

in the following we work only with the component elds along the i basis.

19

note that in (43) the le and lf are the ones given in eq.(12) and eq.(39), re-
spectively, and the auxiliary (bosonic) elds d, d,d, and d (with d, d, and

, d, being, respectively, a scalar, vector, and antisymmetric tensor
analogously d
under o(4)) should be added to the lagrangian in order to close the o-shell susy
algebra. we recall that the lagrangian in eq.(43) is not hermitean, but it satises the
osterwalderschrader reection positivity [26].

finally, the (o-shell) n=1 susy transformations which leave invariant the la-

grangian (43) (up to a total derivative) are given by

where the complex fourspinor  is the (gaugesinglet) susy innitesimal anticom-
muting parameter, and  satises the identity   tc. in the proof of supersym-
metric invariance, the relations (41) should be used. note that we expressed the
susy transformations only in terms of the a elds, the corresponding ones for the
transpose elds t
a can be simply derived. the expressions for the eld-strength f a

are



f =  a  2g(cid:16)tt

we now analyze the n=2 susy extension of the model in [8] by requiring, as in the
zumino model [28], the hermiticity of the action in euclidean space. in order to obtain
an hermitean action, one has to introduce a complex fermionic eld  and its adjoint
 have, respectively, the o(4) coordinate transformation
one, namely
properties as dened in (29) and (30). for our convenience we formally decompose 
 as in eq.(37) and eq.(31), respectively. the main dierence with the previous
and
14 we recall that in order to make a comparison (by using the notation of (49)) between eqs. (33)

. the  and

and (49), the bar over the  matrices in (33) should be eliminated.

21

n=1 extension is that, in order to obtain an hermitean action, the component elds of
 (namely a in (37)), are the corresponding adjoint ones of the a elds. obviously
the denitions (38) and the relations (41), unlike the n=1 case, do not apply in this
case.

the fermionic degrees of freedom are doubled with respect to the n = 1 theory
in eq.(43), and so new bosonic (real) matter elds h and w should be introduced
in order to close the n=2 susy algebra [28]. in components we have

h = h5 + h + h5 + h

w = w 5 + w + w5 + w

(50)


2

2

where h = h and w  = w . under the o(4) coordinate transformations and ex-
tended gauge transformations, the eld h (and analogously for w ) should transform
as follows

h(x)  h(x) = s() h(x)s1() ,

h(x)  h g(x) = u(x) h(x)u1(x)

(51)

unlike the zumino model where the gauge symmetry is internal, the components
h, h (and analogously for h), and h transform, according to eq.(51), as a
scalar, vector, and antisymmetric tensor of rank 2 under o(4) coordinate rotations.
analogous considerations hold for the w eld.

finally, the expression (in compact notation) for the n=2 sym lagrangian, which
is invariant (up to a total derivative) under on-shell susy transformations and su(4)
extended gauge transformations, is given by [28]

] and
the trace t r are taken in the cliord algebra basis i. we recall that the  and
5 matrices appearing in eq.(52), belong to the other cliord basis i dened in
eq.(27). it is easy to prove that the lagrangian (52) is hermitean and invariant under
the following onshell n=2 susy transformations [28]

where complex four-spinor  is the (gaugesinglet) innitesimal parameter of the
n=2 susy transformations, and  is its adjoint one. note that, unlike the n=1
case, the presence of both susy parameters  and , ensures that the n=2 susy
transformations are hermitean. clearly, the number of fermionic degrees of freedoms
has doubled with respect to the n=1 case.
we do not give the corresponding results of eqs.(52) and (53) in terms of the o(4)
irreducible components, since their expressions are quite complicate. however these
can be easily obtained by applying the standard decomposition methods (into o(4)
irreducible representations) explained in section [2] and in the present one.

we stress that the n = 2 sym theory in eq.(52) is particularly interesting,
since it naturally contains matter scalar elds ( h and w ) which could generate the
spontaneous symmetry breaking of the extended gauge symmetry. we will return on
this point in section [7], where the spontaneous symmetry breaking will be analyzed.
moreover, it would be interesting to study, in minkowski space, the nonperturbative
solutions of the n=2 sym model in eq.(52), by generalizing the corresponding ones
of seibergwitten theory [29].

before concluding the present section we underline the characterizing properties
of the above introduced supersymmetric extensions. the extended gauge symmetry
mixes elds of dierent spin but with the same statistics. on the contrary a susy
transformation mixes elds of dierent statistic. moreover, due to the fact that the
maximum spin of the gauge-charges is spin-1 and the susy charges have spin-1/2,
the transformations which leave invariant the total action, can mix elds of spin-s
with elds of spin-(s  s), where s = 1 and s = 1/2 correspond to a gauge
and susy transformation, respectively. finally the product of a susy and gauge
transformation can produce a |s| = 3/2 spin-transition.

5 internal symmetries

in this section we generalize the model in [8] so as to include the standard internal
gauge symmetries. this is eected by restricting our choice to the compact groups
su(n).

this generalization is obtained by considering a lie group whose algebra is given
by the tensorial product of the cliord and u(n) algebra bases. it is important to

23

note that the elements given by the tensorial product of the unity matrix of su(n)
with the cliord algebra basis are necessary in order to close the algebra. as a conse-
quence we have (in 4 dimensions) a lie group containing 16n 21 generators, which
form the algebra (in euclidean space) of su(4  n). the corresponding elements
of the extended algebra (which we call y ) containing internal symmetries generators
can be represented in the compact form

y a

i = ni  1it, i  ta, 1i  tao ,

(54)

where the symbol  indicates the standard tensorial product between the matrices
i (of the cliord algebra basis) and ta (of su(n)), 1i, and 1it are the unity
matrix of i and su(n) respectively. by i we denote any element of the reduced
cliord algebra basis which does not contain 1i. the matrices ta satisfy the following
commutation and anticommutation rules

[ta, tb] = if abctc,

{ta, tb} = 2cf ab1it + dabctc,

[ta, i] = 0,

(55)

where the following normalizations are used t r(tatb) = 1/2ab and cf = 1/(2n)
for the ta matrices in the fundamental representation. the structure function dabc
is a complete symmetric tensor with null traces dabcab = 0.

this y algebra was proposed a long time ago in refs.[30],[31] in the context of
the relativistic extensions of the su(6) model [32] for the strong interactions (the
corresponding lie structure functions can be found in ref.[30]). we want to stress
that, although there is a coincidence of the symmetry group, there is no analogy
between the model in [8] and the model proposed in refs.[30],[31], and the theoretical
inconsistencies [33] which are present in the latter do not aect the theory of the
model in [8].

now we give the generalization of the gauge transformations (7)-(10) by including
the internal symmetries generated by the group su(4  n). we begin with the
unitary gauge group element u(x) which is given by

u(x) = exp {  1it + a(x) (ta  1i) + a(x) (ta  5) + a

(x) (ta  )

+ a

(x) (ta  i5) + a

(x) ta 



2!) ,

(56)

where  is given in eq.(10). we require that u(x) transforms as u(x) in eq.(8)
under coordinate transformations. then, due to eq.(3) and to the fact that the
su(n) generators commute with the o(4) transformations [ta, s()] = 0, only the
greek indices in the i parameters in (56), transform like vectorial indices under

24

o(4) coordinate transformations.
for the generalization of the gauge potential a we may proceed in the same way.
we dene a to have the same coordinate and gauge transformation properties of
a in (2) and (7) respectively. then we decompose a along the y algebra basis in
(54) as follows 15

a = a  1it + aa

(x) (ta  1i) + aa

(x) (ta5  1i) + t a

(x) (ta  )

+ t a

(x) (ta  i5) + c a

(x) ta 



2! ,

(57)

where the expression of a is given in eq.(4). as in the case of a, the greek
indices of the component elds in (57) transform like vectorial indices under the o(4)
coordinate transformations.

the pure ym lagrangian in terms of the a eld which generalizes (12), so as to

include the local internal symmetries, has the same formal expression of (12)

lis(x) =

1
8
f (x) = 

f],

t r[f
a  

a + g[ a, a],

(58)

where the commutators and trace have to be evaluated on the y algebra. the full
expression for the lagrangian lis in terms of the component elds in (57) as well
as the innitesimal gauge transformations which leave invariant lis are given in the
appendix.

it is worth noting that, since the y algebra contains also the anticommutators
of the su(n) generators, the couplings between the extended a gauge elds (4)
and the corresponding ones aa
 (along the ta basis) appear in the lagrangian (69-70)
(see appendix). as a consequence, in the gauge lagrangian the complete symmetric
structure functions dabc of the su(n) gauge group appears. the presence of the dabc
structure functions is one of the most interesting aspect of this generalized model,
which has no precedent (as far as we know) in any known gauge theory. moreover it
is remarkable to note that, after rescaling in eqs.(69-70) the kinetic term (by setting
it in the canonical form) of the pure extended gauge elds a, the couplings between
 gauge elds decrease as g/n (in the fundamental representation) in
the a and aa
the large n limit.

15 to avoid confusion note that the symbols ta and t a

 indicate the su (n ) generators and the

tensor elds along the  ta basis respectively.

the coupling of the gauge eld a with fermion elds in the adjoint representa-
tion can be obtained in a way similar to the one used in section [4] by taking into
account the dierent commutation rules of the y algebra. typically the generaliza-
tion so as to include the internal symmetries in the susy transformations (49) is also
straightforward.

6 bosonic matter fields

in this section we study the couplings of the gauge elds with the matter elds 
which transform as the fundamental representation of the extended u(4) gauge group.
we will see that for these kind of elds the only consistent gaugeinvariant theories,
which are compatible with the spinstatistic theorem [34], are of bosonic type. in
particular, in order to build a coordinate and u(4) gaugeinvariant lagrangian, the
eld  of lowest spin must be a nonhermitean one ij (where i and j are spinorial
indices) which transforms, under o(4) coordinate transformations, as the adjoint of
the spinorial representation of the rotation group, namely

x  x =  

 x,

ij(x)  ij(x) = (s()(x)s1())ij,

(59)

where s() is dened in eq.(3) and the standard matrix multiplication is assumed.
therefore the  eld can be decomposed as follows

 = 1i + 5  + b + 5 b + c ,

(60)

where ( ), b( b) and c are complex scalar, vectorial and tensorial elds respec-
tively. now we dene its properties under local gauge transformations. in particular
we have

  g = u(x),   g = u(x),

(61)

where u(x) is given in eq.(9) and the standard multiplication between matrices is
assumed. note that the group u(4) is dened to act on  and  on the right and left
respectively. finally, the most general gaugeinvariant and renormalizable (by power
counting) lagrangian, which contains only the  eld and the gauge connection a,
is given by

l = t rhddi + t rh5ddi + t rh [d, d] i +

t rh [d, d] i + m1t rhdi + m2t rh5di +

transforms, according to eq.(7), as u(x)du(x). each single term in eq.(62) is
invariant under o(4) coordinate rotations and u(4) gauge transformations (61). the
independent coecients mi (i=14) and j (j=116) are mass parameters and adi-
mensional coupling constants respectively.
it is worth to note that in eq.(62), apart from the rst term and the other ones
proportional to m3, 1, and 9 couplings, the other gaugeinvariant terms have no
counterpart (as far as we know) in any known gauge theory.16 moreover we nd that
a minimal non-trivial lagrangian can be obtained by taking in eq.(62), for example,
just only the terms proportional to m1 and m3. in particular it is not dicult to see
that the lagrangian

lmin

 = t rhdi + mt rhi + h.c.

(64)

generates non-trivial dynamics for the component elds in . in particular one can
see that, on-shell, the b and b elds (dened in eq.(60)) are the dynamical ones,
while c, , and  play the role of auxiliary elds and can be eliminated by solving
the corresponding algebraic equations.

it should by now be clear that it is not possible to couple directly the extended
gauge symmetry on the ordinary spin-1/2 fermion elds. simply because the free
lagrangian of a standard spin-1/2 eld is not invariant under global extended gauge
transformations u(4). however it is possible to couple directly the matter elds 

16 note that in eq.(62) the rst term and the other ones proportional to m3, 1, and 9 couplings

are also invariant, in addition to the (61), under the local gauge transformations   u u .

27

to the ordinary gauge elds. this is now shown with an example. we assume that
the  are charged under an abelian u(1) interaction. then we have to add in the
covariant derivative d of eq.(63) the u(1) gauge connection a as follows

dij

 = ij + g aij

 + eaij,

(65)

where a is the u(1) gauge eld and e is the corresponding gauge coupling. we also
assume that the standard matter elds are charged under the u(1) gauge symmetry.
in order to have a reasonable decoupling between the extended gauge sector and the
ordinary matter elds, the  should have a mass scale much higher than ordinary
matter elds scales. in particular the decoupling between ordinary particles and the
massless gauge or gaugino sector of the extended gauge theory is generated when
the massive  are integrated out. therefore, eective couplings between the sectors
of the ordinary gauge and the extended gauge elds can be generated by means
of higher dimensional operators which are suppressed by the corresponding inverse
powers of the typical mass scale of the  elds. this mechanism to generate couplings
between the observable sector and the light one of the extended gauge symmetry has
some analogies with the gauge-mediated mechanisms proposed in soft susy breaking
models [35]. we stress that this is one of the possible mechanisms to couple the
ordinary matter and gauge sector to the extended one. in particular the role of the
electromagnetic gauge vector mediation described above could be played by any other
eld which is a singlet under the extended gauge transformations.

7 spontaneous symmetry breaking

in this section we analyze the spontaneous symmetry breaking (ssb) of the extended
gauge symmetry by means of the standard higgs mechanism.17 as usual, one has
to introduce bosonic matter elds with an ad hoc (gauge invariant) potential in or-
der to spontaneously break this symmetry.
it is worth observing that the ssb of
the extended gauge symmetry can generate the spontaneous breaking of the o(4)
(coordinate) rotational one. indeed nonzero vacuum expectation values can be gen-
erated for some vector or tensor components of the matter elds. nevertheless, as we
will show in the following example, there exists a special ssb pattern which leaves
unbroken the o(4) rotational symmetry.

17 it is clear that the physical interpretation of the higgs mechanism makes sense only in minkowski
space, although this mechanism can also be analyzed in euclidean space, but, of course, with a
dierent meaning.

28

at this purpose we introduce one real matter eld  in the adjoint representation
of the extended su(4) gauge group, like the elds h and w which appear in eqs.(50)
in the n=2 susy model. its expression in components is given by

 = 5 +  + 5 + 


2

(66)

where  = , and it has the same transformations rules of h in eqs.(51). we now
add to its kinetic term the su(4) gauge invariant potential v (x). the expression for
its gauge invariant lagrangian l is given by

l =

1
4

t r(cid:20)(cid:16) d(cid:17)2(cid:21)  v (x) ,

v (x) = (1

4

t r(cid:16)2(cid:17) 

2

 )2

(67)

where  > 0 and 2 > 0 are the self-interacting coupling constant and a mass term
respectively. the solution for the minimum of v (x) is given by ht r (2)i = 2/, or
in component elds

h 2 +  +   + i =

2


(68)

unlike the case of matter elds in the fundamental representation, there exist several
solutions of eq.(68) which correspond to nonequivalent ssb patterns [36]. however,
we are interested in the special ones which leave the o(4) rotational group unbroken.
clearly, due to the presence of the o(4) scalar  in the multiplet (66), the only solution
which satises this requirement is given by: h i = q2/, with h i = h i =
h i = 0. in particular the su(4) gauge group is broken, while the o(4) rotational
symmetry remains exact.18 this solution can be easily understood by using the
standard techniques [36]. since  is a traceless 44 hermitean matrix, one can always
make an su(4) gauge transformation in order to diagonalize , while preserving the
minimum condition (68). there are several nonequivalent ssb patterns associated
with the three independent real eigenvalues of the diagonal matrix diag().
in
particular, the solution which leaves unbroken the o(4) rotational group, corresponds
to the ssb pattern hi  diag(1, 1,1,1), which is proportional to the 5 matrix
in the so-called chiral basis.

18 it is worth noting that in smaller extended gauge theories, in particular the ones with so(5)
and so(4) gauge groups (whose generators are given by {, } and  respectively), there are
no ssb patterns in the adjoint representation which would preserve the o(4) rotational symmetry.
this is connected to the fact that for these smaller groups there are no o(4) scalars in the matter
elds in adjoint representations.

29

after shifting the scalar eld  around its minimum,  = h i + , the spectrum of
the theory is manifest. the gauge elds in eq.(12) which remain massless are the a
and c ones, since the corresponding generators (respectively 5 and ) commute
with 5, being 5 the generator associated to h i. therefore, the su(4) gauge group is
broken to the exact one so(4) u(1). on the contrary, due to the higgs mechanism,
the tensor elds t and t  acquire a mass term, since the corresponding generators
(respectively  and 5) do not commute with 5. note that this result is in
agreement with the ssb patterns of su(n), see ref.[36] for further details. indeed,
by means of matter elds in the adjoint representation, su(4) can be broken to
su(2)  su(2)  u(1), which is isomorphic to so(4)  u(1) [36].
it is straightforward to generalize the above results to minkowski space. by using
in this space the same form of the potential (67), the largest extended gauge group
(which is su(2, 2) [8]) can be broken to the noncompact one so(3, 1) u(1), while
the lorentz invariance remains exact.

8 conclusions

in this article we analyzed the free particle spectrum of the extended ym gauge
theories in euclidean space. we found that the physical degrees of freedom contained
in the pure gauge sector of the su(4) group correspond to the spin contents of the
following massless elds: 3 spin-2, 8 spin-1 and 8 spin-0. some of the spin-1 and
spin-0 elds correspond to the longitudinal polarizations of the tensor elds which
cannot be gauged out. moreover we analyzed some quantum aspects by providing
the functional quantization in euclidean space for a general class of covariant gauges.
we presented the results for the n = 1 and n = 2 supersymmetric extensions
of the action in ref.[8]. moreover we found that the maximum semi-integer spin of
the supersymmetric extensions is 3/2 (in four dimension) and these rarita-schwinger
elds could be regarded as the supersymmetric partners of the spin-2 elds present
in the pure gauge theory.

the generalization so as to include the standard internal symmetries introduces a
larger unied group. in this model the corresponding algebra of this group is given
by the tensorial product of the cliord and the internal symmetry algebra. we give
the expression of the extended ym lagrangian generalized so as to include an su(n)
internal group. an interesting consequence of this unied algebra is that, in addition
to the antisymmetric structure functions f abc of the internal su(n) group, also the
complete symmetric ones dabc appear in the lagrangian (69-70).

we analyzed the matter elds which transform as the fundamental representation

30

of the extended gauge symmetry group. in this case we found that these elds can
only be of bosonic type. moreover it is important to stress that new kind of gauge
invariant and renormalizable couplings can be generated by means of these matter
elds (see eq.(62)), couplings which have no counterpart in any known gauge theory.
finally we analyzed the ssb of the extended gauge symmetry. in particular we show
that there exists a special ssb pattern where the extended su(4) gauge symmetry
can be broken to so(4)  u(1), while leaving exact the o(4) rotational invariance.
we conclude the present section by commenting on the possible future develop-
ments of this study. it would be worth investigating the analytical continuation of this
model in minkowski space by analysing the unitarity of the s matrix in perturbation
theory. the understanding of this issue could be helpful in clarifying the relation be-
tween unitarity and renormalizability in the higher spin interactions. moreover, other
interesting aspects of this model, which we believe are worth investigating, are the
instanton solutions, and the possible embedding of this theory in a string framework.
