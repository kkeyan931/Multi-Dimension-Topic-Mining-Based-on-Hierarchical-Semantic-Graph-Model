abstract

we start with a new rst order gauge non-invariant formulation of mas-

sive spin-one theory and map it to a reducible gauge theory viz; abelian

bf theory by the hamiltonian embedding procedure of batalin, fradkin

and tyutin(bft). this equivalence is shown from the equations of mo-

tion of the embedded hamiltonian. we also demonstrate that the original

gauge non-invariant model and the topologically massive gauge theory can

both be obtained by suitable choice of gauges, from the phase space par-

tition function of the emebedded hamiltonian, proving their equivalence.

comparison of the rst order formulation with the other known massive

spin-one theories is also discussed.

i. introduction

the construction and the study of massive spin-1 theories which are also gauge

invariant has a long history [1], the well-known example being models with higgs mech-

anism. since the existence of higgs particle has not yet been experimentally veried,

it prompts a closer look at other models wherein mass and gauge invariance coexist.

one such model which is currently being studied is the topological mechanism for gauge

invariant mass for spin-one particle without a residual scalar eld, wherein vector and

tensor (2-form) elds are coupled in a gauge invariant way by a term known as bf

term [2]. the lagrangian for this model (for abelian case) is given by

l = 

1
4

f f  +

1

2  3!

hh  +

bf ,

where h = b + cyclic terms. this lagrangian is invariant under

a  a + ,

b  b + (   ).

(1)

(2)

(3)

a similar construction has also been made for non-abelian theory [3].

the invariance of b when  = , in (3) necessitates the introduction of ghost

for ghost terms in brst quantization of the bf theory [4]. it can also be seen in the

constraint quantization where this invariance makes the generators of gauge transforma-

tion linearly dependent [5]. this theory shows a similar constraint structure as that of

massless kalb-ramond theory in the existence of rst stage reducible constraint [6].

the purpose of this paper is to construct a new rst-order formulation of massive

spin-one theory involving vector and 2-form elds (see eqn (8) below), which is gauge

non-invariant and by following the idea of hamiltonian embedding due to batalin, frad-

kin and tyutin (bft) [7], we show that the resulting theory is equivalent to bf theory

2

(1). thus we have a novel representation of the abelian bf theory in terms of a gauge

non-invariant rst order formulation.

the motivation for this study is two fold. one is that the bf theory, in addition

to being a candidate as an alternate for higgs mechanism also appears in diverse areas

like condensed matter physics [8] and black-holes [9]. hence a model which is an equiv-

alent realization of it has potential applications. the other is that the hamiltionian

emebedding procedure, employed here, by itself is of current interest. several models

like abelian and non-abelian self-dual model in 2+1 dimensions, abelian and non-abelian

proca theories have been studied in detail in recent times applying the bft procedure

[10]. here we apply it, along the lines of [11] to demonstrate the equivalence between

self-dual model and maxwell-chern-simons theory, to establish the equivalence of this

gauge non-invariant theory (8)to the reducible gauge theory (1).

we work with g = diag (1  1  1  1) and 0123 = 1

in order to compare our formulation with the other known formulations of massive

spin-1 theories, we rst recollect them. the earliest formulation is in the form of a

rst order relativistic wave equation due to dun-kemmer -petiau(dkp) [12], which is

given by

(i + m) = 0 ,

(4)

where  is a 10 dimensional column vector and  are 1010 hermitian matrices obeying,

 +  = g  + g.

the other well-known theory is that of proca lagrangian,

l = 

1
4

f f  +

m2
2

aa

there is, another formulation involving 2-form eld [13] given by

3

(5)

(6)

l =

1
12

hh  +

m2
4

b b ,

(7)

where h = b + cyclic terms.

both these formulations (6, 7) can be made gauge invariant by adding suitable

stuckelberg elds to compensate for the gauge variations of the mass terms, the com-

pensating elds being scalar and vector elds for the lagrangians (6 and 7) respectively

[14]. it should be pointed out that the stuckelberg formulations of both these theories

are equivalent by duality transformation to bf theory [15].

the new rst order lagrangian describing massive spin-1 theory involving a one form

and a two form elds, which is proposed and studied in this paper, is given by

l = 

1
4

h h  +

1
2

gg +

1
2m

h g.

(8)

this lagrangian obviously has no gauge-invariance. the eld equations following

from this lagrangian are

 h +

g = 0,

and g +

from these equations, it follows that

1
m
1
2m

 h  = 0.

h  = 0,

and

g = 0.

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

the fact that the above lagrangian describes a massive spin1 theory can be easly seen

by rewriting the coupled equations of motion (using the conditions (11) and (12)) as

( + m2)h = 0,

(13)

or alternatively

4

( + m2)g = 0.

(14)

since the equation of motion (14) along with the constraint (12) follows from proca

lagrangian, we should expect the latter to emerge from the above lagrangian (8).

indeed by integrating out h from the lagrangian (8), proca lagrangian (6) is obtained.

similarly, by eliminating g from the lagrangian (8) we arrive at the lagrangian (7).

it is natural to ask how this lagrangain (8) is dierent from the rst-order formulation

of lagrangians (6, 7).

the standard rst-order form of proca lagrangian is given by

l =

1
4

b b +

1
2

bf  + m2aa.

(15)

here, by eliminating the linearzing eld b, we get back to the proca lagrangian (6).

but eliminating a will not lead to the lagrangian (7) for 2-form elds. similarly, the

standard rst order form corresponding to the lagrangian (7) is

l = 

1

2  3!

cc  

1
3!

ch  + m2b b.

(16)

here, too, eliminating b from the above lagrangian will not lead to the proca la-

grangian involving 1-form (6).

it should be stressed that (8) is dierent from the standard rst-order formulations

(15, 16), by being the rst-order formulation for both (6) and (7).

the rst order eld equations (9) and (10) can be rewritten as

( + m)  = 0 ,

(17)

where  is a 10 dimensional column vector whose elements are the independent compo-

nents of g and h. but here the  matrices are not found to obey the dkp algebra

(5).

this paper is organised as follows:

in section ii, hamiltonian embedding of the

lagrangian (8) is constructed along the lines of bft and the embedded hamiltonian

is shown to be equivalent to that of bf theory. section iii shows the equivalence in

phase space path integral approach using the embedded hamiltonian. finally we end

up with conclusion.

ii. hamiltonian embedding

we start with the lagrangian (8), with the last term expresed in a symmetric form

as

l =

(18)

this lagrangian can be re written as

l =

oijk0h ijgk  hc

(19)

where hc, the hamiltonian density following from the above lagrangian (19) is

the primary constraints are

2m

0i  0,
0ijkh jk(cid:19)  0,

the persistence of the primary constraints leads to secondary constraints,

0ijkjgk(cid:19)  0.

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

the non-vanishing poisson brackets between these linearly independent constraints are

{0(~x), (~y)} = (~x  ~y),

n0i(~x), j(~y)o = j

i (~x  ~y),

{i(~x), j(~y)} =

{i(~x), jk(~y)} = 

{ij(~x), (~y)} =

oijk(~x  ~y),

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

thus all the constraints are second class as expected of a theory without any gauge

invariance. note that the constraints i and ij are due to the symplectic structure of

the lagrangian (8). following fadeev and jackiw [16], the symplectic conditions, which

are not true constraints, are implemented strongly leading to the the modied bracket,

{gi(~x), hjk(~y)} = m0ijk(~x  ~y).

(32)

consequently i and ij are implemented strongly.

now we enlarge the phase space by introducing canonically conjugate auxiliary pairs

(, , pi, and qi) and modify the remaining second class constraints such that they are

in strong involution, i.e., have vanishing poisson brackets. to this end, we dene the

non-vanishing poisson brackets among the new phase space variables to be

{(~x), (~y)} = (~x  ~y),

nqj(~x), pi(~y)o = j

i (~x  ~y).

the modied constraints which are in strong involution read

 = 0 +  ,

 =  + ,

i = 0i + qi



i = i  pi.

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

following the general bft procedure we construct the hamiltonion which is weakly

gauge invariant and is given by

hgi = z d3x(cid:20)hc +

2 + igi 

1

(i)(i) 

1
2

pipi 

1

qijh ij +

1
4

qijqij(cid:21) ,

(39)

where qij = (iqj  jqi). the poisson brackets of modied constraints with hgi are

{, hgi} = ,

{, hgi} = 0,

{i, hgi} = 
i,

{

i, hgi} = 0.

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

thus all the modied constraints are in involution with the hgi as one can easily see

from their poisson brackets. the gauge transformations generated by these rst class

constraints (35 to 38) are

(cid:26)g0,z d3x (cid:27) = ,
(cid:26)a,z d3x (cid:27) = ,
(cid:26)h0i,z d3xii(cid:27) = i,
(cid:26)pi,z d3xii(cid:27) = i,
(cid:26)gi,z d3x (cid:27) = i ,
(cid:26),z d3x (cid:27) = ,
ii(cid:27) = (ij  ji),
jj(cid:27) = i.
(cid:26)qi,z d3x

(cid:26)hij,z d3x

(44)

thus the combinations

g0 = g0 + a,

8

gi = gi + i,

hoi = hoi + pi,

hij = hij  qij.

(45)

are gauge invariant under the transformation generated by the rst class constraints (35

to 38). next we re-express gauge invariant hamiltonian density hgi in terms of these

gauge invariant combinations,

hgi =

hij h ij 

1

1

hoi h oi 

gi gi +

1
2

1
2

g0 g0  g0   h 0i 
i,

(46)

where  and 

i are the constraints  and 

i expressed in terms of the gauge invariant

combinations (45).

the equations of motion following from this hamiltonian (46) are,

g0 +

1
2m
1
2m
 h0i +

gi +

 hij +

0ijki h jk = 0,

0ijkj gk = 0,

i h  = 0,
1
m
1
m

ijg = 0.

these equations can be expressed in a covariant way, i.e.,

g +

1
 h  = 0,
2m
1
 h +
m

 g = 0.

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

from these equations it follows that  g = 0 and  h = 0. these also follow as

the hamiltonian eqations of motion for g0 and h0i, respectively. the gauge invariant

solution for these equations which also satisfy the divergenless condition for gand h

are

9

g  h =

1
3!
h  f =

h ,
1
2

f .

(51)

where h  = b + cyclicterms and f = (a  a).

now, by substituting back the solutions for g and h in hgi (46), the involutive

hamiltonian density becomes

hgi =

1

fijf ij 

1

f0if 0i +

hijkh ijk + g0   h0i i

(52)

where  = ( 1

3! 0ijkh ijk  1

m if0i) and i = ( 1

2 0ijkf jk + 1

4 j h0ij).

with

1
3!

hgi becomes,

1
2

0ijkf jk = bi,
1

and

0ijkh ijk = b,

f0i =  ei,

0ijkh 0jk = ei,

hgi =

1
2 (cid:16)e 2 + b2(cid:17) +

1

2 (cid:16) e 2 + b2(cid:17) + g0   h0i i

(53)

(54)

this is the hamiltonian following from the bf lagrangian (1). note that  and i

are the gauss law constraints for the bf theory. the latter, which was an irreducible

constraint in terms of gauge invariant combination becomes a reducible constraint when

expressed in terms of the solutions (51), obeying i i = 0. by substituting back the

solutions for g and h into the equations of motion follwing from hgi (49, 50), they

become

  f +

m
3!
m
2

h  = 0,

h 

f  = 0,

(55)

(56)

which are the same equations as the one following from the bf theory. thus under

bft embedding, the elds appearing in the original hamiltonian (20) get mapped to

10

gauge invariant combinations (45) of the embedded hamiltonian-hgi (46). the solutions

to the equations of motion follwing from hgi uniquely map the embedded hamiltonian

to that of bf theory. also the irreducible constraints i and  in the original

hamiltonian (20) get mapped to the reducible constraint i and  respectively.

iii. phase space path integral approach

the equivalence of the theory described by the lagrangian (8) to bf theory can

also be established using phase space path integral method. by suitable choice of gauge

xing conditions, the partition function of the embedded model can become that of

original massive spin-1, gauge non-invariant theory or that of bf theory, proving their

equivalence.

the partition function for the embedded model described by the hamiltonian (39)

is

zemb = z d()(i)()(

i) (i) exp iz d4x l,

(57)

where we have omitted the trivial fadeev-popov determinant for the gauges chosen

below. the measure is,

d = d0doidddpidqidgdh,

and

l = 0 g0 + 0i

h 0i +   + pi

qj +

1
4m

0ijkh ij0gk 

1
4m

oijkgi0h jk  hgi

(58)

where hgi is the invariant hamiltonian given in (39); (i) are the gauge xing condi-

tions coresponding to the rst class constraints of the embedded model. now we have

twenty two independent phase space variables (remember i, and ij are not indepen-

dent degrees of freedom) along with the eight rst class constraints giving the correct

degrees of freedom required for a massive spin-one theory.

11

choosing the gauge xing conditons

(i) = (0)(0i)()(i),

(59)

and integrating out the canonical conjugate variables , , qi and pi and momenta 0

and 0i from the partition function reduces zemb to

z = z dgdh ()(i)exp i z d4x l,

(60)

where l is the original rst order lagrangian (8), with the gauss law constraints im-

possed through () and (i). note that the original second class constraints are the

gauge xing conditions (59).

next we choose the gauge xing conditions as

(i) = (ih0i)(iqi)(i)(ij),

where

i = (gi 

ij = (hij 

1
m
1
m

0ijkj h 0k)

0ijkkg0),

(61)

(62)

(63)

to show the equivalence of the embedded model to the bf theory. owing to the

constraints  and i, the d0, d0i, integrations are trivial. the d, and dpi

integrations along with the constraints (), and (

i) lead to the terms  1

4m2 gijgij

and

1

23! hijkh ijk in the exponent. using the fact that igi = 0 and ihij = 0 on the

constraint surface of i and ij and the gauge xing conditions (iqi) and (ih0i),

we carry out the integrations over dqi and d, which are just gaussian. thus the

lagrangian in the partition function becomes,

l =

1
2m

0ijk0gih jk

4m2 gijgij +

2m2 g0ig0i +

after using the constraints (62, 63) and the conditions 2h0i =  m

2 0ijkgjk and

2g0 = m

2 0ijkih jk implied by (62, 63), the partition function becomes,

z = z dadb (i)(ij) exp i z d4x l

where l, with the identications

1
m
1
m

g = a,

h = b

(65)

(66)

(67)

is the lagrangian of bf theory(18). the constraints i

and ij,

in terms of

a and b become,

i = (mai  0ijkj b0k),

and

ij = (mbij  0ijkka0)

(68)

(69)

i and ij which are the gauge xing conditions for the linearly independent generators

i and 

i, now play the role of gauss law constraints of the bf theory. now

2b0i = 

and 2a0 =

m
2

0ijkf jk,

m
2
0ijkibjk,

(70)

(71)

(fjk = jak  kaj), are the gauss law constraints in the gauge i = 0 and ij = 0.

since i is not a reducible constraint, coresponding gauge xing condition is also not

reducible; but it implies the reducible gauss law constraint (70) present in the bf

theory. it is interesting to note the complimentary behavior of gauss law constraints

which comes as the gauge xing conditions in the partition function for the embedded

model.

conclusion

13

in this paper we have started with a new rst order formulation of massive spin-one

theory which is gauge non-invariant and converted it to a theory with only rst class

constraints following the line of hamiltonian embedding of bft. we showed that the

embedded hamiltonian is equivalent to the hamiltonian of bf theory. this was shown

both from the solutions of equations of motion following from the embedded hamiltonian

and from the phase space path integral in a suitable gauge. we also point out how an

irreducible constraint of the rst order theory gets mapped to the reducible constraint

of the bf theory. it should be pointed out that the rst-order lagrangian (8) and its

equivalence to topologically massive gauge theory are both new results.

a similar rst order lagrangian can be formulated for massive spin-zero particle, but

now involving a 3-form and a scalar elds as

l = 

1

2  3!

cc  

1
2

 +

1

4! m

c ,

(72)

where c = c + cyclic terms. interestingly here the eld content is the same

as that of dkp formulation of spin-zero theory.

the equivalence demonstrated here is of the same nature as that between self-dual

model [17] and maxwell-chern-simmon theory in 2 + 1 dimensions, shown in [11]. the

behavior of the elds of the embedded hamiltonian here is the same as that of 2 + 1

dimension self-dual model; viz, the gauge variant elds of the embedded model can be

mapped to the fundamental elds of the bf theory or that of the original model.

despite this similarity, model in (8) is dierent from the self-dual model. the latter

describes only half the degrees of freedom compared to that of massive spin-one theory

in 2+1 dimensions and consequently is equivalent to the parity violating maxwell-chern-

simmon theory. also the self-duality condition is possible only in 4k  1 dimensions.

but the former describes all the three states of polarization needed for massive spin-one

particle and also this construction is possible in all dimensions and has a even-parity

14

mass term. owing to the even-parity mass term described by this model, the 2 + 1

dimensional non-abelian generalization of (8) may be related to the recently constructed

jackiw-pi model [18]. the self-dual model and maxwell-chern-simmon correspondence

has proved to be useful in bosonization in 2 + 1 dimensions [19]. it should be interesting

to see similarly if the equivalence proved here has a role in studying bosonization in 3+1

dimensions. it is also interesting to study the hamiltonian embedding of the non-abelian

version of (8). work along these lines are in progress.

we have exploited the gauge symmetry arising due to the hamiltonian embedding

procedure to prove the equivalence between two dierent formulations of massive spin-

one theory. there is a dierent procedure which also has the potential to establish

equivalence among dierent formulations [20]. in this method, the new degrees of free-

dom are added by hand, which generates abelian gauge algebra and this is used to gauge

x suitably, to arrive at a dierent formulation of the original theory like for example

bosonisation [21].

it should be interesting to investigate if the quantum equivalence

proved here survives the case of coupling with external elds like gravitation and elec-

tromagnetism also.
