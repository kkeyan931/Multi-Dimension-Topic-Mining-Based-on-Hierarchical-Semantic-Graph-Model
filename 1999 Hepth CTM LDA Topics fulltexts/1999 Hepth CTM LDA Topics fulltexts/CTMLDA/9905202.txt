(3) usual conventions,smn() signies matrix v v... v acting m-th n-th component identity ones, rk() signies matrix tensor space acting th k-th component identity ones. 2.1 general boundary crossing relation consider solution ybe following property s(w) = p () 2 (something) , (4) w so-called crossing parameter (it usally rescaling ) ,and p () 2 completely antisymmetric project operator v 2. fact, addition rational elliptic solution ybe properties ( 4) ,there exist 3 series trigonometric solution ybe (which trigonometrical limit zn belavin solution ) carrying property ( 4). due property ( 4),one construct completely antisymmetric fusion procedure r-matrix.first, give notation fusion. let v = c n ( 2 n) v dual space v .then homorphism c : ce = c : v n1(v ) i1...in1 ei1 ... ein1 , 1 p(n 1)! e base dual space v i1....in1 n-th order completely antisymmetric tensor. fusion procedure r-matrix ,one obtain theorem 2.1 integral l (l n) , dene r(l)() : v l v l r(l)() = rl( + lw)sl1,l(2 + (2l 1)w)...r1( + w) image r(l)()|(l)(v ) also (l)(v ) .furthermore,we dene r() : v v r() = c 1p () n1rn( + (n 1)w)sn1,n(2 + (2n 3)w) .....r2( + w)p () n1c . (5)  ybe properties ( 4), easy see following properties s12(w)s13(2w)...s1l((l 1)w)s23(w)....sl1,l(w) = p () l , sl,l1(w)sl,l2(2w)...sl1((l 1)w)sl1,l2(w)....s21(w) = p () l , 4 (6) (7) p () l completely antisymmetric project operator v l m, end(v l) .using ybe bybe, one  r1( + w)s21(2 + 3w)...sl1(2 + (l + 1)w)r2( + 2w) ...rl( + lw) = r(l)() . thanks properties (6) (7), means p () l r(l)()p () l = r(l)()p () l (8) (9) , ensure us im(r(l)())|(l) (v ) (l)(v ) . position mention crossing relation generic n .because crossing relation boundary r-matrix mainly considered,let us assume r() already enjoyed unitarity :r()r() = 1 , s() enjoyed unitarity crossing symmetry s12()s21() = 1 , jl ik = s( nw)kj li , (10) sv,v () = (1 c 1)(1 p () n1)s1n( + (n 1)w)....s12( + w) (1 p () n1)(1 c) . using denition r() ,the unitarity s() r() ,one nd r() following inversion relation r()r( nw) = 1 . (11) theorem 2.2 r() obtained fusion r() also directly expressed k j = d()lj kl l l , (12) 5 d() scaler factor (actually quantum determinator r() )  owing fact dim(n(v ) equal 1 theorem 2.1 ,one k mjm l l = d()jk , d() scaler factor depends r() s() .using inversion relation (11) crossing symmetry s() (10), one obtain k j = d()lj kl l l . (12a) due (12),one reduce d() 1 rescaling boundary matrix r() .therefore,one determine scaler factor r() using following relation k j = lj kl l l . relation considered generalization crossing relation generic n.when one considers v ,circumstances slightly change n=2 n > 2 case . speaking terms young tableau , v = ,the fundamental repre- sentation sln, v corresponds vertical n-1 ,the space antisym- metric tensors v n1 .thus v v identied even level young tableau n=2 .for n > 2 , complex procedure (5) needed (12a) non-trivial extension crossing relation n > 2 . however,when n equal 2 ,the restricted condition scaler factor r() become given ghoshal zamolodchikov.we checked rational ,trigonometric elliptical type solution bybe. hence,in order determine exact boundary reecting matrix ,one impose following condition r() (bybe,unitarity,crossing relation) bybe : s12(1 2)r1(1)s21(1 + 2)r2(2) = r2(2)s12(1 + 2)r1(1)s21(1 2) , (13) 6 unitarity r()r() = 1 , crossing relation : k j = lj kl l l (14) .(15) condition reduce scaler factor cdd factor () also generalized satisfying follow requirement ()() = 1 , n yl=1 ( + lw) = 1 . (16) n=2 ,the requirement return usual one.moreover,this ambiguity canceled dynamical requirement. 2.2 example determine exact boundary reecting matrix r() ,the following proce- dure usually taken : rst,one obtain solution (13) upon scaler factor;then, unitarity (14) crossing relation (15) used determine scaler factor.in subsection, obtain rational diagonal solution bybe generic n. without losing generality, rst nontrivial extension crossing relation applied determine scaler factor n=3. here,we consider rational solution ybe unitarity crossing relation satised,which given follows s() = a()1 + b()p = k()( + w 1 + w + w p ) , p permutation operator v 2: p (ei ej) = ej ei scaler factor k() equal k() = ( ( nw )( nw )( nw + 1 nw + 1 nw ) nw ) . 7 bybe leads following functional equations a(1 + 2)b(1 2)rk j (1)rl i(2) + a(1 2)b(1 + 2)ri (1)rl (2)k j +b(1 + 2)b(1 2)ri j (1)rl (2)k = a(1 + 2)b(1 2)rl i(1)rk j (2) + a(1 2)b(1 + 2)rk (1)ri j (2)l +b(1 + 2)b(1 2)rl (1)ri j (2)k . diagonal case ,i.e rj () = ri()j , equations become a(1 + 2)b(1 2) = a(1 2)b(1 + 2) . (17) solution (17) r() = (cid:26) r() , r() + , n l otherwise (17a) diagonal solution two parameters :l n c ,which structure diagonal solution trigonometric solution given de vega . simplicity without losing generality,we consider crossing relation solution (17a) l=2 n=3,namely,r() equal 1 1 r() + . using fusion r() ,one get r() = r( + w)r( + 2w)k(2 + 3w)( 2w)( + w) ( + 2w)( + + w) 1 1 ++w 2w . hand,from crossing relation (15), one obtain r() = r( 3w)k(2 + 3w)( + 3w)( 2w) ( + 2w)( 3w) 1 1 ++w 2w . 8 (18) (19) (20) so, unitarity crossing relation (14) (15) lead requirements scaler factor r() r()r() = 1 , r( + w)r( + 2w)r( + 3w) = ( + + w)( + 3w) ( 3w)( + w) . solving equations,one obtain scaler factor r() upon cdd ambiguity, r() = ( ( 3w + 1 3w + 1 3w )( + 3w + 1 3 ) 3w )( 3w + 1 3 ) 3 )( 3w ) 3 )( + 3w ) ( ( () , (21) () cdd factor satises equations ()() = 1 , ( + w)( + 2w)( + 3w) = 1 . (22) equations (22) cdd factors satised generalized version n=2 case . acknowledgements author w.l. yang thank prof.l. chao fruitful discussions.
