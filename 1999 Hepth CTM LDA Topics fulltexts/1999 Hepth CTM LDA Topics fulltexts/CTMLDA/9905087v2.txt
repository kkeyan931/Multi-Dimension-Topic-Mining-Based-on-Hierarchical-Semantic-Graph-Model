abstract

high energy xed angle scattering is studied in matrix string theory. the saddle point
world sheet congurations, which give the dominant contributions to the string theory am-
plitude, are taken as classical backgrounds in matrix string theory. a one loop uctuation
analysis about the classical background is performed. an exact treatment of the fermionic
and bosonic zero modes is shown to lead to all of the expected structure of the scatter-
ing amplitude. the ten-dimensional lorentz invariant kinematical structure is obtained
from the fermion zero modes, and the correct factor of the string coupling constant is
obtained from the abelian gauge eld zero modes. up to a numerical factor we reproduce,
from matrix string theory, the high energy limit of the tree level, four graviton scattering
amplitude.

1. introduction

weakly coupled perturbative string theory is conjectured to be described by the strong

coupling limit of the matrix string supersymmetric gauge theory [1][2][3] (see also [4] for

a review). in [3] it is observed that the strong coupling limit corresponds to the infra red

limit of the theory, and that symmetry more or less constrains the low energy eective

action to be that of the light cone type iia cft. matrix string theory, however, is a non-

perturbative description of string theory and will contain phenomena, inaccessible to the

infra red xed point reasoning of [3], which can only be investigated by studying the gauge

theory. a necessary rst step in this direction is to derive, directly from the gauge theory,

standard string perturbation theory. although this program has not yet been realised

several pieces of the puzzle have been found.

matrix string theory has classical solutions corresponding to interacting string world

sheets in light-cone gauge [5](see also [6]). the strings split and join via instanton like

eld congurations consisting of two regions; a core region, around the interaction point,

where the elds do not commute, and an asymptotic region, away from the interaction

point, where the elds do commute and where the eigenvalues glue together to form the

riemann surfaces of light-cone string theory [7](see also [8]). arguments have been given

that in the large n [5] or the strong coupling limit [9] the eective theory is indeed the

type iia cft dened on the corresponding riemann surface. however there are subtleties

that mean that these arguments are not completely justied. an analysis of the eective

expansion parameter for a perturbative gauge theory loop expansion [10] shows that the

loop expansion diverges for most physical scattering processes. there is thus, at present

no rigorous approach to calculating the strongly coupled gauge theory in most situations

of physical interest.

a simple analysis does, however, lead to an explanation of the factors of the string

coupling constant gs associated with a string diagram [9]. in the strong coupling limit

there is, in addition to the green-schwarz light cone string action, a completely decoupled

abelian gauge theory. the power of gs is entirely due to the zero mode structure of this

abelian gauge-eld; it is just the dierence between the number of closed, non-exact one-

forms (the gauge eld zero modes) and the number of ghost zero modes (exactly one, the

constant mode).

in this paper we focus on a scattering process where perturbative gauge theory cal-

culations can be justied. the scattering process chosen is high energy, xed angle, string

1

scattering, originally studied, from the string theory point of view, in [11][12] and re-

analyzed from the perspective of matrix string theory in [7].

indeed it was originally

pointed out in [7] that this is a process where a perturbative gauge theory calculation

might be justied. the scattering amplitude for high energy, xed angle scattering is

dominated by a classical world sheet conguration whose size, in the target space, is pro-

portional to the incoming momenta. in other words high momenta correspond to large

(in the target space sense) world sheets. by going to suciently high momenta, i.e. by

making the world sheets suciently large, we can justify using a perturbative gauge theory

calculation. this is similar to matrix theory [13] graviton scattering calculations where

one pulls the gravitons suciently far apart to be able to use a perturbative calculation.

we will study explicitly the tree level contribution to the four ground state scatter-

ing amplitude. starting from the instanton-like classical matrix string conguration for

such a world sheet we will estimate the uctuation determinant and calculate exactly the

contribution of the bosonic and fermionic zero modes. we will see that the zero mode

calculation leads to all of the expected structure of the scattering amplitude. in addition

to the correct power of gs (observed in [9]) we will reproduce the precise ten dimensional
lorentz invariant kinematic structure of the amplitude. the uctuation determinant can

not be calculated exactly, but we can nevertheless make some qualitative assessment of its

overall form. the nal result being that we will reproduce, up to an unknown numerical

factor from the determinant, the four graviton scattering amplitude.

although we explicitly focus on the four graviton scattering amplitude the formalism

is general and can be applied to the scattering of any ground state particles. the calcula-

tion can also be generalized, in principle without diculty, to loop scattering amplitudes,

although we do not pursue this in this paper.

we begin, in section 2, by covering some of the essential matierial necessary for the

calculations of later sections. we start with a very brief review of matrix string theory.

we then turn to saddle point world sheets in high energy string scattering and how they

occur in light cone string theory. next we review the instanton like eld congurations

corresponding to nite string interactions and how they embed into a solution correspond-

ing to a string worldsheet splitting and joining at the interaction points. finally we study

the kinematics of four particle scattering in light cone gauge in the centre of mass frame

and derive a few simple kinematic identities useful for section 8.

in this paper we perform a one loop uctuation calculation around classical world

sheet congurations of matrix string theory. section 3 discusses the validity of such a

2

calculation and denes the euclidean one loop action. in particular the minkowski space

majorana-weyl fermions are combined into complex fermionic coordinates and momenta

which then allow a wick rotation into euclidean space.

section 4 analyses the uctuation determinant. sections 5 and 6 are devoted to the

zero modes. in section 5 we focus on the behaviour of the zero modes in the neighbourhood

of the instanton-like congurations, the objective being to understand how the core of the

instanton, where the elds do not commute, eects the niteness of the zero mode eld

congurations. far from the core of the instanton these eld congurations commute with

each other and can be glued into global zero mode congurations for the global classical

eld congurations corresponding to light-cone string diagrams. these global zero modes

we construct in section 6.

in section 7 we discuss the incoming and outgoing wavefunctions and show how to con-

struct ground state wavefunctions. in particular we explicitly construct from the fermionic

coordinates of section 3 the graviton wavefunction.

section 8 is then devoted to the four graviton scattering amplitude, we explicitly inte-

grate over all zero modes, the integration over the gauge and ghost zero modes leading to a
factor of g2
s (as argued by [9]) and the integration over the fermion zero modes reproducing
the ten dimensional lorentz invariant kinematic factors for four graviton scattering.

having focused in previous sections on four graviton scattering we summarize in sec-

tion 9 the general procedure for calculating high energy scattering amplitudes in matrix

string theory, and point out the close connection with standard light cone gauge super-

string calculations. we nish section 9 by discussing how the analysis might be performed

away from the high energy limit, and speculate on how the calculations could be be given

a rigorous basis.

technical details of the euclideanization of the fermions and the fermion zero mode

integrations are contained in the appendix.

2. matrix string theory, world sheets and high energy scattering

2.1. matrix string theory

matrix string theory [1][2][3] is equivalent to ten dimensional sym theory dimension-

ally reduced to two dimensions :

st i [x i, s](cid:3).

(2.1)

3

a careful derivation of this action (using the ideas of [14][15][16]) from the original matrix
theory proposal [13] can be found in [7]. all elds are n  n hermitean matrices. the
index i for the bosonic elds runs from 1 to 8 and corresponds to the transverse directions
of the ten dimensional target space. the 16 component fermion elds s split into sa and
s a, the 8s and 8c representations of so(8). the matrices ,  = 1,    , 9 are the spin(8)
gamma matrices with 0 in the dirac operator /d equal to the sixteen by sixteen unit

matrix. gs is the string coupling constant and the coordinate  runs from 0 to 2. the

action (2.1) is conjectured to describe non-perturbative type iia string theory compactied
on a light-like circle with n the number of quanta of p+ momenta along the compactied

direction.

string world sheets are described in matrix string theory by commuting matrix con-

gurations in which the n eigenvalues of the matrices form a branched covering of the

cylinder, and hence form the riemann surfaces of interacting light-cone string theory.

these surfaces are characterized by strings of dierent length which split and join, the
total length of the strings, which corresponds to the light-cone p+ momentum, being pre-
served. in the limit n   the moduli space of the branched coverings is equivalent to
the moduli space of all possible two-dimensional riemann surfaces. a crucial ingredient

of these congurations is that they are associated with a topologically non-trivial two di-

mensional gauge eld, which via wilson lines generates the correct monodromy around

all the branch points [5]. specically a single valued matrix description of a multivalued

branched covering of the cylinder is given by

x = u diag(x1,    , xn )u , a = igsu (u ),

(2.2)

where the eigenvalues xi form the branched covering and the unitary matrix u (which is

multivalued) generates the monodromies around the branch points.

the gauge eld congurations however are singular at the branch points and lead to a

delta function singularity in the eld strength. as was realised in [7] this singularity can be

resolved by instanton like eld congurations. far from the core of the instanton the elds

commute with each other and their eigenvalues describe a riemann surface with a branch

point. close to the core of the instanton, however, the elds no longer commute and the

riemann surface interpretation breaks down. it is to be expected that any classical string

world sheet will have a corresponding classical solution in matrix string theory.

4

fig 1. light cone string world sheets in matrix string theory

in [7] it was shown that there exists a physically very interesting class of classical world

sheets that preserve a certain amount of symmetry around the branch points and hence

allow a simple construction of the instanton like eld congurations. these world sheets

are the saddle point classical world sheets dominating the amplitudes of high energy, xed

angle string scattering. before reviewing the construction of the matrix string solutions

we briey recall how these saddle point world sheets appear in light cone string theory.

2.2. high energy scattering and light cone string theory

high energy, xed angle scattering processes were studied in string theory in [11][12].

string theory simplies enormously in this limit as the integral over world sheets localizes

around a nite number of saddle-point congurations. it was conjectured in [11][12] that

the saddle point world sheets of dierent genus follow the same target space path, up to an

overall scaling factor. this simplication permits one to study string perturbation theory

out to arbitrarily high orders. one of the results of this analysis is that the perturbation
series is extremely divergent, with the genus g world sheets contributing a factor of g9g. a

non-perturbative description such as matrix string theory should provide a natural cut-o

to this divergence. first steps in an analysis along these lines were taken in [7]. we will be

less ambitious in this article and focus on retrieving from matrix string theory standard

string perturbation theory. for the purposes of this article, we focus on high energy

scattering as a means to justify using a perturbative gauge theory calculation. below we

describe how the saddle-point world sheets arise in light cone string theory.

5

in light cone string theory the virasoro constraints have been imposed at the classical

level to eliminate the non-physical degrees of freedom. specically light cone string coor-

dinates, x  = 1/2(x 0  x 9) have been eliminated from the dynamics by imposing the

gauge

x + = ,

(2.3)

where  is the world sheet time direction. the coordinate x  is then a function of the
transverse coordinates x i (i = 1,    , 8) and the fermion elds.

the light cone coordinates w =  + i are dened using the mandelstam mapping

from the light cone diagram to the riemann surface with uniformization z

p+
i g(z, zi),

w =xi

(2.4)

where g is an abelian dierential with purely imaginary periods and real part equal to the

greens function. the existence and uniqueness of such a dierential for arbitrary genus

has been proved in [17][18]. the branch points of the light cone string diagram are situated

at the zeros of , i.e. the stationary points of w as a function of z. in the neighbourhood
of a simple zero of  situated at z0 we have w  w0 = (z  z0)2.

for tree level scattering we have

w =  + i =xi

ini log(z  zi),

(2.5)

with z dened in the complex plane and ini the p+ momentum of the ith string. the i
are equal to +1 for incoming states and 1 for outgoing states. the lengths of the strings
are proportional to their p+ momenta. the light-cone interaction points are given by the

zeros of zw = 0, i.e. by the roots of the polynomial equation

ini
z  zi

xi

= 0.

the classical solution for a string world sheet is given by

x =xi

ipi log |z  zi|,

where pi are the transverse momenta and z = z(w) is dened through (2.5).

(2.6)

for the classical eld congurations (2.7) the light cone action is given entirely by

boundary terms

s =

(2.8)

where the i are the initial(nal) times for the scattering process and the  integral for the
ith string runs over an interval of length ni. for i very big, i.e. far from the interaction
region, equation (2.5) can be inverted perturbatively and substituted into (2.7)(2.8) to

obtain the results

the dots in (2.9) correspond to exponentially small corrections. the rst term in the action

(2.9) is a phase factor corresponding to the time evolution of the incoming and outgoing
states with respect to light cone hamiltonian p, and cancels out in scattering amplitudes

(see [19]). the second term is the physically relevant lorentz invariant contribution :

i |2/(2ni), pi

i|2/(2ni), pi

the saddle point contribution to the action is found by looking for the stationary

point of the above term under variations with respect to the modular parameters zi.

2.3. classical world sheets in matrix string theory

the matrix string solutions for a general classical world sheet can be expected to be

complicated. however a relatively simple solution does exist for the saddle point world

sheet congurations which dominate high energy scattering amplitudes. below we briey

7

review the construction for the four string scattering process. full details can be found

in [7].

in the centre of mass frame the scattering process describes a two dimensional

plane and the corresponding classical world sheet can be described by just two of the eight
transverse coordinates, x 1 and x 2. for convenience these are combined into a pair of
complex elds dened by

x =

1
2

(x 1 + ix 2) and x  =

(x 1  ix 2).

1
2
0 and z

(2.12)

the light cone world sheet has two branch points z+
0 given by the two roots of
the quadratic equation for four particle scattering of (2.6). the dominant classical world

sheet has the property that the complex scalar eld x is an antiholomorphic, respectively,

holomorphic function of z in the neighbourhood of the two branch points. specically :

= 0.

(2.13)

(2.14)

this symmetry allows a simple construction for the instanton-like eld congurations

around the branch points. the starting point is the four dimensional self dual ym equation

dimensionally reduced to two dimensions. the two possible signs for the self dual equations

correspond to the two dierent holomorphic behaviours of equation (2.13). the instanton
solution around the branch point z+
0 is obtained from f = f with 0129 = +1.
in terms of the two dimensional elds the equation reads

i
gs

[x, x ]

fw w = 
dwx =0

d wx  =0

(2.15)

where, in addition to the complex scalar elds dened in (2.12) we have introduced complex

two dimensional gauge elds and coordinates

a =

1
2

(a0  ia9) and w =

1
2

(0 + i9).

(2.16)

a simple solution to these equations of motion corresponding to a simple branch point

involving two eigenvalues is

x = u xu 

and a = igsu u with

x = b w3,

and u = e

8

1

8 ln w

w 1 .

(2.17)

as already described this leads to a delta function singularity in the eld strength at the

interaction points. this singularity can be removed once we are working with complex

coordinates x, by using a complexied gauge transformation g which also has a singu-

larity at the origin tuned in such a way as to leave a singularity free eld strength. with

this insight the solution can be written in the form

x =u g xg1u 

a =  igs(cid:2)g1(wg) + u (wu )(cid:3),

(2.18)

where the diagonal matrix x and unitary matrix u are as in (2.17) and the matrix g is
given by

g = e(w w)1 .

(2.19)

this ansatz automatically satises the last two equations of (2.15) with the rst equation

leading to a dierential equation for 

(2

for

(2.20)

where r = w w is the radial distance from the branch point. the boundary conditions
are necessary for a nite solution. in particular the second boundary condition ensures
that there are no 1
w pole terms in the gauge eld a and hence no delta function singularity
in the eld strength fw w.

there is no explicit solution to this equation but it can easily be solved numerically.

in terms of the function  the expressions for the scalar elds x and the eld strength

fw w are given by the simple expressions

x = b w(cosh 3 + isinh 2)

and fw w =

2ib2

gs

r sinh2.

(2.21)

for simplicity we do not include the nal gauge transformation u

the instanton like solutions (2.21) are imbedded into a global solution, dened on

the cylinder, corresponding to the classical world sheet. the parameter b of equations

(2.17),(2.20) and (2.21) is determined in terms the four external momenta by

|b|2 = |p1p

3  p
n1n2n3n4

1p3|(n1 + n2)

,

(2.22)

where the pi and p
its complex conjugate. the ni are the p+ momenta for the ith string.

i are the complex transverse momenta associated with the eld x and

9

finally we note that there are two physical scales associated with the instanton. firstly

the dierential equation (2.20) can be given a dimensionless form by absorbing the coupling

constants into a rescaling of the radial coordinate.

in other words the instanton has a

natural world sheet scale :

linst (cid:18) g2
b2(cid:19)

s

1
3

.

(2.23)

secondly, a simple analysis of the limiting behaviour of the eld x at the origin shows

that there is a minimal target space distance between the two strings :

dinst =ptr(x(0)x (0))  g

s |b|

(2.24)

2.4. kinematic relations for four string scattering

we will explicitly study the four string ground state scattering process. the calcula-

tion is performed in the centre of mass frame. in this subsection we give various kinematic

identities useful for the calculations of later sections.

all particles are massless. they have transverse momentum lying in the x 1,x 2 plane
specied by the complex numbers pi = 1/2(p1
i ). the p+ momentum is given by
the length ni of the string. to make contact with standard conventions for scattering

i + ip2

processes we dene all ten-vectors of momenta ki to be incoming momenta :

ki = (p+

i , p

i , pi, p

i ) =( (ni, |pi|2
(ni,  |pi|2

, pi, p
i )
for
, pi, p
i )

ni

ni

i = 1, 2

for

i = 3, 4

,

(2.25)

where

|pi|2 = pip

i =

1
2

the dot product of two momenta then reads

((p1

i )2 + (p2

i )2).

ki.kj = p+

i p

j  p+

j p

i + (pip

j + p

i pj ).

in the centre of mass frame conservation of momentum reads

p1 + p2 = p3 + p4 = 0

n1 + n2 = n3 + n4 = n

|p1|2 n

n1n2

= |p3|2 n

n3n4

= p2,

10

(2.26)

(2.27)

(2.28)

where in the nal line (conservation of p momentum) we have used the rst and second
lines (conservation of transverse and p+ momenta) to simplify the result and to dene the
quantity p2. inverting the third line we can write |p1|2 and |p3|2 in terms of p2

|p1|2 =

n1n2

n

p2

and

|p3|2 =

n3n4

n

p2.

(2.29)

finally it is useful to dene the ten dimensional lorentz invariant quantities for the scat-

tering process

s = (k1 + k2)2 = 2k1.k2
t = (k2 + k3)2 = 2k2.k3
u = (k1 + k3)2 = 2k1.k3,

(2.30)

where the sign conventions are, as before, for k1,k2,k3 and k4 incoming momenta. using
the denitions for the ki (2.25) along with the identities (2.28) and (2.29) the lorentz
invariants s,t and u can be written as

s = 2p2

(n1n3 + n2n4)

(n1n4 + n2n3)

p2  2q2
p2 + 2q2

t = 2
u = 2

n 2

n 2

with

q2 = p

1p3 + p3p
1.

(2.31)

p2 in the above expressions is given in (2.28)(2.29). it is easy to check that the above
expressions satisfy the identity relating s, t and u for massless particles

s + t + u = 0.

(2.32)

3. perturbative calculations and the euclidean action

the analysis performed in this paper will be a one loop calculation. it is important

to know the domain of validity of such a approximation, particularly since string theory is

meant to be recovered from matrix string theory only in the strong coupling limit, where

one might expect perturbative calculations to be unjustied.

compensating for the fact that the uctuations become strongly coupled is the fact

that (through their strong coupling to the background) they also become very massive.

a study of the balance between these two eects, in the large n limit, was carried out
in [10]. the principal result of this analysis was that if one takes n   before taking
limits of any of the other parameters (string coupling gs or external momenta pi) the loop

11

expansion indeed diverges and a perturbative calculation cannot be used. the divergence
comes from integrating out eld variables that become massless in the limit n  .
more precisely the distance between neighbouring strips (diagonal eld variables) on the

world sheet tends to zero as does the minimal distance, dinst (2.24), between strings in

a string interaction. these distances (along with a factor of 1/gs) control the mass of the

uctuations.

both these distances can be kept large, however, if one allows the size of the string to
scale with powers of n. if the size of the string scales as n x with x > 1/2 all terms in the
loop expansion are suppressed in the limit n  .

since the size of the classical string background is determined (2.7) by the external

momenta we see that the perturbative calculation will be valid if p, (for given n ) is su-

ciently large. in what follows we will thus assume that we are studying nite n [20] very

high energy scattering. we will calculate the dominant contribution to the amplitudes as
the transverse momenta p  . it is then justied to integrate out the uctuations at
quadratic order. the result will be determined by a uctuation determinant and integra-

tion over the zero modes.

note however that we are still making an approximation. asymptotically far from

the interaction points the classical background splits into separate blocks for the dierent

strings. each block is proportional to a unit matrix. the o diagonal elements within a

block are thus massless. this is a result of the fact that we are not using true matrix string

wavefunctions. presumably there is some lsz type reasoning that could be developed to

justify replacing the true matrix string wavefunctions by simple diagonal blocks.

3.1. euclidean fermions

the fermions of the action (2.1) are majorana weyl fermions in ten dimensional

minkowski space and consist of sixteen real fermionic components. we will need to work

in ten dimensional euclidean space (dimensionally reduced to two dimensions) where the

instanton conguration and functional integral are dened, and where it is not possible

to dene majorana weyl spinors.

in addition the majorana weyl fermions satisfy the

commutation relations

{sa(), sb()} = ab(  )

and { s a(), s

b()} =  ab(  ),

(3.1)

12

where a, b and a, b denote respectively the 8s and 8c representations of so(8). in other
words the spinor sa is simultaneously a coordinate and its conjugate momenta, and sim-
ilarly for s a. the spinor variables can however be combined into complex spinor coordi-
nates, which are distinct from their conjugate momenta, and which can be used to dene a
euclidean action. the complexication procedure means that the so(8) symmetry of the
theory will no longer be manifest, although, as we will see, it is restored in the calculation
of physical amplitudes. a similar complexication procedure has to be carried out in light
cone superstring theory [19].

the calculation of this paper is up to quadratic order only in the background uctu-
ations. to quadratic order the dirac operator involves only four gamma matrices, 0 and
9, which couple to the background gauge eld and 1 and 2 coupling to the background
elds for x 1 and x 2. this fact permits a simple denition for the euclidean action. we
start by choosing a basis for the gamma matrices such that the four gamma matrices,
0,9,1 and 2, can be written as four by four blocks (see appendix). we then dene
four spinor coordinates a, a,a,
(see appendix)

 a and four corresponding momenta a, b,a,

the indices a and a take the values a, a = 1, 2. note that  is not the complex conjugate
of , they are distinct variables. the notation is chosen to match standard conventions
for spinors in four dimensional space (see [21]). this choice of coordinates breaks the

correspond to so(2) rotations in the x 1,x 2, and (with the basis of gamma matrices chosen
in the appendix) x 3,x 4 planes. the su (2)  su (2) corresponds to an so(4) for the
remaining four dimensional space x 5, x 6, x 7 and x 8. the charges of the fermions under
the rotations in the x 1,x 2 and x 3,x 4 planes as well as the transformations under rotations
in the x 5, x 6, x 7, x 8 can be read o directly from the form of the eight dimensional ij
(see appendix). the nal result of this decomposition is that we have the following bosonic
and fermionic coordinates.

note that this decomposition of the fermions into coordinates and momenta diers from

in section 8 we will use the transformation properties of the spinors ,, and

the standard decomposition used in light cone superstring theory [22][19] where one breaks
the spin(8) symmetry of the spinors into u (1)  su (4). the classical background further
breaks the su (4) down to u (1)  su (2)  su (2).

specically we will construct the combinations of  and  corresponding to the x,x , x, x 
. these left and right
and x m components of an so(8) vector and similarly for  and
so(8) vectors will form incoming and outgoing graviton states. we will then explicitly

calculate the four graviton scattering amplitude.

3.2. the euclidean action

it is convenient in this section to use ten dimensional notation for the bosonic elds.
indices  run from  = 0,    , 9 and split into indices 0, 9 for the two dimensional cylindrical
coordinates on which the elds depend and i = 1,    , 8. all bosonic elds are denoted by
a with ai = x i. we then split the elds into a background part, a, corresponding to
the classical matrix string solution and a uctuation part v :

atotal = a + v,

(3.6)

with v i = y i . to calculate the eect of quantum uctuations about the classical con-
guration the action needs to be gauge xed. we use the standard background covariant

gauge xing term

lgf = (dv)2 with d =  +

i
gs

[a, ].

(3.7)

(3.8)

where v are the bosonic uctuations and  and  the fermionic coordinates and momenta

dened in (3.2). the elds c are the ghosts. d is the background covariant derivative

given in (3.7). using the denition of gamma matrices given in the appendix the fermionic

the fermionic coordinates  act as lagrange multipliers and integrating over them

leads to (/d). in other words the functional integral for the fermionic coordinates  is

projected down onto their zero modes. this is discussed in more detail in the context of

light cone string theory in [23]. the jacobian factor from this projection is det(cid:0)/d/d(cid:1).

in this section we focus on the contribution from the non zero modes i.e. on the

determinants. for the four string scattering background considered in this paper both the

fermion term and the boson term consist of four by four non-trivial blocks. canceling

part of the trivial block of the bosonic determinant with the ghost determinant the total

uctuation determinant j reads

j =

where the indices ,  take the values 0, 9, 1, 2, and zero modes have been excluded from

the determinants. the fermion determinant is in four by four spinor space and the boson

determinant in four by four ,  space.

it is well known that the fermionic and bosonic uctuation determinants precisely

cancel in a self dual background. using the denition of gamma matrices given in the

appendix it is only a short calculation to verify that this is indeed the case. specically

for the instanton background of section 2.2 we have

in other words if the background was self dual everywhere the uctuation determi-

nant would be equal to one. the matrix string background corresponding to four string

scattering is however only locally self dual around the branch points and its uctuation

determinant would be corrected by perturbations from the non self dual part away from

the interaction points. the important point to note is that, in the regime where it is

justied to use a one loop calculation, these are just small corrections and to lowest order

can be dropped. the conclusion from this analysis is that the interaction points do not

lead to a singular contribution to the determinant. this is true even in the limit where gs

and hence (via (2.23)) the size of the instanton, tend to zero.

it is interesting to compare this result with what one would expect from a cft

uctuation determinant around a branch point.

in light cone superstring theory [23] 

and  have the conformal weights 1 and 0, respectively. potentially there is a singular

contribution coming from the square root cut point which hides a world sheet curvature

singularity. smoothing this out over some cut o distance  leads to a singular contribution

1/

c

12 coming from the induced liouville action for the bosons and fermions. however for

the choice of weights given above the bosonic and fermionic central charges cancel and

there is no singular contribution. this can also be seen directly from a comparism of the

determinants (see [24]).

the conclusion of this section is that there are no singular contributions to the deter-

minant coming from the interaction points and that this is consistent with the light cone

superstring calculation. this does not mean, however, that the uctuation determinant

will be equal to precisely one. we will return to this point in section 8. the remaining part

of the functional integral is an integration over a nite number of zero modes and collective

coordinates of the background conguration. in the next two sections we construct these

modes.

16

5. instanton zero modes, local considerations

in this section we focus on the eld congurations in the neighbourhood of the in-
stanton. the objective is to understand how the core of the instanton, where the elds
do not commute, eects the niteness of the zero mode eld congurations. far from the
core of the instanton the elds commute and the zero modes correspond to those dened
on a riemann surface in the neighbourhood of a branch point. in particular we will see
that there are zero modes which, from the riemann surface point of view, would appear
to diverge at the branch point, but which are rendered nite by the non-commuting core
of the instanton.

fig 2. finite eld congurations for singular zero modes

shown in the w plane and the z = w plane.

these singular modes will play a crucial role in the next section where we construct
global zero modes. the instanton is embedded into a global classical solution corresponding
to a classical string world sheet. the instanton zero modes will thus be imbedded into
global zero modes which tend, asymptotically far down the strings, to constant values.
from the point of view of the world sheet these modes can be written as holomorphic
and/or antiholomorphic functions of the cylindrical coordinates. the singularities at the
branch points are important since it is only with singularities that one can construct non-
trivial global modes.

the global zero modes will include the moduli for the classical string world sheet along
with their superpartners and zero modes for the abelian gauge theory dened on the string
world sheet.

for the purposes of this section we will treat the instanton as being imbedded into the
complex plane. below we will explicitly construct the bosonic and fermionic zero modes,
imposing the condition that they must be nite everywhere (except at innity).

17

5.1. bosonic zero modes and collective coordinates

the classical solution for the instanton (2.18)(2.19)(2.20) involves only the two dimen-

sional gauge eld a and two of the 8 possible scalar elds, x1 and x2. there are three
types of bosonic zero modes for the uctuations about this conguration characterized by

which elds they tend to asymptotically. firstly there are the two-dimensional gauge eld

zero modes. these come from the fact that the gauge xing term doesnt completely x

the gauge. in other words there are local gauge transformations that are zero modes of

the gauge xing term. the second correspond to translations and deformations of the

instanton solution, and asymptotically involve only the scalar elds x1 and x2. finally
there are modes involving x3,    , x8. all three types are zero modes of the eigenvalue
equation for quadratic uctuations about the classical instanton background :

(cid:2)dd +

 = (n)v (n)



.

(5.1)

2i
g

[f ,

](cid:3)v (n)



are the uctuation modes and (n) their eigenvalues. for com-

in this equation the v (n)
pactness the equation has been written in its ten dimensional form. the ten dimensional
indices ,  = 0,    , 9 split into the two dimensional indices ,  = 0, 9, corresponding
to the cylindrical coordinates, and the indices i = 1,    , 8 corresponding to the scalar
matrix elds. the covariant derivatives d are covariant with respect to the background
elds, i.e. d =  + i/g[a,
], and f is the background eld strength. the standard
feynman background gauge xing term (da)2 has been used.

5.2. gauge eld zero modes

for the gauge eld zero modes we search for gauge-elds, v, that are locally pure

gauge,

v = d,

(5.2)

and which satisfy equation(5.1). substituting (5.2) into (5.1) and commuting the covariant
derivative to the right through the d2 term cancels the f term and leads us to look for
modes  that satisfy

dd = 0,

(5.3)

i.e. to look for zero modes of the gauge xing term. the resulting gauge elds v must be
nite everywhere (except possibly at innity) and must tend to some function times 3 at
innity so that they commute with the bosonic elds. note that equation(5.3) is just the

18

equation of motion for the complex bosonic eld x. so we can immediately write down a

candidate zero mode :

( 1

2 ) = x .

with x given by (2.21). the gauge eld zero mode v ( 1

2 ) = dw( 1

2 ) is given by

(5.4)

(5.5)

v ( 1

2 ) =

1
w 1

2(cid:2)(

1
2

cosh + rr sinh)3 + i(

1
2

sinh + rr cosh)2(cid:3).

one still has to check that v ( 1
2 ) is nite at the origin, since it potentially diverges as 1/r.
using the fact that for small r (r) = 1/2 log r + a +o(r2), we see that it is indeed nite
at the origin :

v ( 1

and is thus a valid zero mode.

the most general solution for the gauge zero modes can be found by writing equa-

tion(5.3) in terms of the two-dimensional elds and covariant derivatives :

dd = dwd w + d wdw 

1

g2(cid:0)[x, [x , ]] + [x , [x, ]](cid:1) = 0.

it is straightforward using (2.15) to see that it is satised by

(5.9)

v (n) = dw(n1).

(5.10)

all these solutions are of course written in the singular gauge in which asymptotically far

from the instanton all elds are diagonal.

the physical meaning of these zero modes is given by their behaviour far from the

non-commuting core of the instanton where they can be interpreted as zero modes of an

abelian gauge eld dened on a riemann surface in the neighbourhood of a branch point.
they are zero modes of the abelian gauge-xing term (v)2. we see that we have the
set of abelian pure gauge zero modes,

vw = w 1

vz = 2wvw we see that we have the full set of abelian gauge eld zero modes,

2 ) which is nite at the origin
2 . unwinding the branch cut w = z2,

vz = 1, z, z2, z3, z4,    ,

(5.12)

dened in the complex z plane. in section 4 we study the zero modes about the classical

solutions corresponding to light-cone riemann surfaces. in other words we imbed the zero

modes constructed above into global abelian zero modes dened on the light cone riemann

surfaces. the fact that we have the full set of zero modes (5.12) means that we will be

able to construct arbitrary abelian zero modes on the riemann surface which are not in

any way pinned to, or constrained by, the interaction points.

the conclusion from this section is that for the construction of the global zero modes

5.3. zero modes for the ghosts and for x 3,    , x 8

the zero mode equation for the ghosts is identical to equations (5.3)(5.7). this allows

to automatically write down all their zero modes. they are given by the solutions for

 (equations (5.8)(5.9)) of the previous section. the important point is that there is no
mode that asymptotically behaves as w 1
non-trivial global zero mode we can construct.

2 and is nite at the origin, so there will be no

since the background only depends on the scalar elds x 1 and x 2 the zero mode
equation for the scalar elds x 3,    , x 8, contains no f term and is thus also identical
to equations(5.3)(5.7). so again there will be no non-trivial zero modes.

5.4. zero modes for x 1 and x 2

the most obvious zero mode to write down for the elds x = 1/2(x 1 + ix 2) and
x  is that corresponding to the translation of the instanton conguration. to construct

this mode one proceeds as for the four dimensional instanton by taking the derivative of

all the elds and at the same time shifting them by a gauge transformation so that the

background gauge xing condition, dv, is preserved. the result being that the zero
modes of (5.1) that correspond to translations are given by

v = a  da = f.

20

(5.13)

the rst term corresponds to translation in the  direction, the second term is the gauge
transformation with gauge parameter a. substituting (5.13) into (5.1) and using the
equations of motion and the bianchi identity this is indeed seen to be a zero mode of (5.1).

written in terms of the two dimensional complex elds of section 2 the solution reads

(cid:18) v
y (cid:19) =(cid:18)fw w

d wx (cid:19)  3(cid:18) 0

w1/2(cid:19) .

(5.14)

its asymptotic behaviour, indicated on the r.h.s, shows that from the world sheet point

of view it is singular at the origin. the non-commutative core of the instanton, however,

renders the eld conguration nite at the origin (see equation(5.6)). as already stressed

the fact that it is a singular zero mode from the world sheet point of view will allow us

to construct a non-trivial global zero mode. it will correspond to deforming the classical

world sheet by moving a branch point.

it is important to check to see if their are any other singular zero modes. the only

other possibility would be a mode asymptotically behaving as w 1
(5.1) in terms of the two dimensional covariant derivatives, eld strengths and scalar elds :

2 . we write equation

](cid:19)) (cid:18) v

y (cid:19) = 0,

(5.15)

where dd, in terms of two dimensional covariant derivatives and elds, has already been
given in (5.7). it is possible to nd simple generalizations of (5.14), satisfying (5.15), for

arbitrary half-integer powers of w :

y (cid:19) =(cid:18)  wnfw w

however there is no obvious, simple generalisation of (5.16) for powers of w. it would

seem natural, however, that there would not be a mode behaving as w 1
nite at the origin.

2 which is also

we will thus assume that this is the case (to prove it would mean analyzing carefully

the coupled dierential equations of (5.15)). with this assumption the conclusion from

this section then is that for the construction of the global zero modes we are allowed a

5.5. fermionic zero modes

the fermion zero mode equation reads

/d = 0,

(5.18)

with /d given explicitly in (3.9). the most important zero mode is that coming from the
euclidean version of the innitesimal minkowski space supersymmetry transformation,

 = f  ,

(5.19)

where  is a constant ten-dimensional majorana-weyl spinor. this can be show to be a
solution of (5.18) by using the gamma matrix identity  =  +1/2(  ),
followed by the bianchi identity and the equation of motion for f .

it is easy to see from (3.9) that the euclidean fermion zero mode equivalent to (5.19)

has the form  =  = 0 and

(cid:18) 
(cid:19) =(cid:18) fw w d wx

where p and
are two component constant, complex spinor variables. the asymptotic
behaviour on the r.h.s. of (5.20) shows that from the world sheet point of view the mode
is singular at the origin. as for the bosonic zero modes the eld conguration is in fact
nite at the origin.

again it is important to check that there are no other singular zero modes. using
the explicit expression for /d of (3.9) it is relatively simple to see that  and  have the same
solutions, respectively, as (n) and (n) (equations (5.7)(5.8)). in other words there is no
zero mode for  or  that from the world sheet point of view appears to have a singularity
at the branch point but is nevertheless nite at the origin.

for  and

 we have already found the singular zero mode (5.19) and there are no
2 since asymptotically

other possibilities (we cannot, for example, have  behaving as w 1
 must be an antiholomorphic function of w).

the fermion zero mode (5.20) is for the self-dual conguration around the branch
0 branch

0 . the zero mode around the anti-self-dual conguration of the w

point w = w+
point can also be read o from (3.9). it is given by  =

6. zero modes, global considerations

in the previous section we analyzed in detail the bosonic and fermionic zero modes in
the neighbourhood of the instanton conguration for the branch points of the matrix string
world sheet. in particular we identied zero mode eld congurations which are nite at
the branch points but from the world sheet point of view appear to have a singularity at
the branch point.
in this section we take these zero modes and imbed them into non-
trivial zero modes for the gauge, boson and fermion elds for global classical solutions
corresponding to light cone riemann surfaces.

we will construct global zero modes which tend to constant values asymptotically far
down the strings. specically we will construct modes satisfying the boundary conditions

v =  v = 0,

 y i = 0,

  = 0

for

 = i or f ,

(6.1)

where i and f are the initial and nal times.

from the world sheet point of view all zero modes can be decomposed as holomorphic
and/or antiholomorphic functions of z, with possible simple pole singularities at the branch
points. at the end of sections 4.2,4.3,4.4 and 4.5 we enumerated the possible pole structures
for the bosonic and fermionic modes. in the following sections we use these singularities to
explicitly construct non-trivial global zero modes satisfying the boundary conditions (6.1).

6.1. abelian gauge and ghost eld zero modes

the two dimensional gauge eld v = 1/2(v  iv) must be a holomorphic function

of w or equivalently of z. we have already seen in the previous section that it can have
the poles 1/(z  z+
0 . this
allows us to construct the following zero mode

0 ) at the branch point z

0 ) at the branch point z+

0 and 1/(z  z

note from equation (2.6) that the numerator of (6.2) has zeros at the branch points and
hence gives the correct pole structure

asymptotically far down a string (z  zi) the boundary conditions (6.1) are satised
with v tending to the constant value ai/ni as indicated in (6.2). a wilson loop encircling
the string thus generates the u (1) element e

ai.

i
gs

the mode (6.2) is the most general abelian dierential dened on the string diagram

riemann surface.

for the ghost eld zero modes no singularities are allowed at the branch points and

there is thus just a single, globally constant zero mode.

23

6.2. bosonic eld zero modes

the non-trivial bosonic zero modes satisfying the boundary conditions (6.1) involve
only the bosonic eld x = 1/2(x1 + ix2) and its complex conjugate. from the analysis
0 and a 1/(zz
of section 4.4 the zero modes can have can have a 1/(z z+
0 )
pole at z = z
0 .

0 ) pole at z = z+

the most general zero mode, with such singularities, satisfying (6.1) is given by a

simple generalisation of (6.2) :

y = bpi i

0 and z = z

where the b and the b are complex numbers. the numerators of (6.4) have zeros at
z = z+
0 (see equations (2.6)). the denominators of the holomorphic and
antiholomorphic parts have zeros at respectively z = z+
0 (see equations
(2.13)(2.14)). so in total the zero mode (6.4) has the correct pole structure. choosing the
standard positions for three of the incoming and outgoing strings z1 = 0, z2 = 1, z4 = 
and z3 =  we can write the zero mode as the simpler expression

0 and z = z

we could, of course, have written down the overall form of this mode directly from the

constraints on its singularities specied above. the advantage, of the more complicated

form (6.4) is that we can read o immediately its behaviour asymptotically far down the

strings which we indicate on the r.h.s of (6.4).

the holomorphic term in (6.5) corresponds to translation of the branch point at z
0
0 . to see this more

and the antiholomorphic term to the translation of the branch point z+
explicitly note that in the neighbourhood of one of the z0s we can write

w = w0 +

(z  z0)2 +   

and x = x(z0) + (z  z0) +   

(6.6)

inverting the rst equation to write z  z0 = p2/(w  w0) and substituting into the

second we arrive at an expression for x in terms of w. we can then dierentiate with

respect to the branch point position w0 to nd

out of the four parameter space two parameters translate the whole classical solution
in the  and  directions, and two change the relative  and  separations of the branch
points.

finally, in addition to the non-trivial bosonic zero modes constructed above, there are
eight constant modes corresponding to globally translating the world sheet in the eight
dimensional transverse target space.

asymptotically far down a string (z  zi) the fermion zero modes tend to the constant
values indicated on the r.h.s. of the above expressions. as we will see in section 8 these
asymptotic values determine the kinematic structure of the scattering amplitudes.

in addition to the non-trivial fermion zero modes constructed above, there are eight,
which take the same constant value on

globally constant fermion modes n ,n ,n and 
each of the four strings.

7. fermion zero modes and graviton wavefunctions

in this section we will focus on the fermionic zero modes for a single string. this is

equivalent to studying the zero modes of the previous section asymptotically far down one

of the strings. we will construct ground state wave functions from these modes.

the decomposition of the fermionic variables (3.2) into coordinates and momenta
explicitly breaks the spin(8) invariance down to u (1) u (1)  su (2) su (2). using the
transformation properties of the  under so(8) rotations however one can build up from

combinations of the  the components of the 8s,8c and 8v representations of so(8). we

will restrict our attention here to the vector representation 8v and will construct one set
of vector components from a and  a for the left moving sector and another set of vector
 a for the right moving sector. tensored together they will then
components from a and
form the ground state quantum numbers for the so(8) polarizations of the graviton gij ,
antisymmetric tensor eld bij and the dilaton . specically, with polarization tensor
ij the wavefunction reads

(ij , , , ,

) = i (, ) j (,

) ij ,

(7.1)

with  and  denoting respectively the left and right moving parts of the wavefunction we

will just focus on the left moving sector, since (before integration over the moduli) the left

and right sectors are completely decoupled and the analysis for the right movers is identical

to that for the left movers. as a book keeping device we will contract the left moving
components with a polarization vector . using the so(8) transformation properties of a
and  a enumerated in section 3 and the appendix the so(8) vector separates into three
parts corresponding to the subspaces (x 1, x 2), (x 3, x 4) and (x 5, x 6, x 7, x 8)

(i, , ) =i (, )i

=(12)(, , , ) + (34)( , , , ) + (5678)(m, , ),

(7.2)

where the indices indicate the corresponding subspaces. the (12), (34) and (5678) are
given by

(12)(, , , ) = ip+(2 +  2)
(34)( , , , ) =  + (p+)2 2 2
(5678)(m, , ) = p+mm ,

26

the standard denitions for 2, 2 and m  are given in the appendix. note that to obtain
the correct u (1) charges for the components of the polarization vector  the wavefunction

 must be assigned the u (1) charges (0, 1) with respect to rotations in respectively the

x 1,x 2 and x 3,x 4 planes. each  is weighted with a factor of pp+, where p+ is mea-

sured incoming to the process. in other words for the two strings 1 and 2 p+ is replaced
respectively by n1 and n2 whereas for the two outgoing strings 3 and 4 p+ is replaced by
n3 and n4. the powers of p+ are needed to reproduce lorentz invariant results.

finally note that in light cone gauge an arbitrary physical polarization vector  can

be constructed by specifying only its components in the transverse space. the equations

of motion impose the constraint

k. = 0.

(7.4)

there is a remaining gauge degree of freedom which leaves the physical polarization con-

dition (7.4) unchanged and corresponds to adding a multiple of momenta k to . by gauge

choice one can set the + component of the polarization to zero. we thus have the physical

polarization given by

with

 = (+, , , , , , m),

+ = 0

and

 =

n

(p + p).

(7.5)

(7.6)

likewise an arbitrary physical polarization tensor  can be specied by its transverse

components.

8. the four graviton scattering amplitude

the calculation involves integrating over all modes. the non zero modes lead to

determinants, whereas the zero modes must be soaked up into the wavefunctions, or, in

the case of the gauge eld zero mode, will be integrated over a nite interval.

in this

section we study in detail the integration over the zero modes. at the end we return to

the uctuation determinant and combine the results to obtain the four graviton scattering

amplitude.

 we deduce the necessary factors, by observing that the resulting scattering amplitude is
lorentz invariant. a more rigorous way of determining them, however, would be to construct the

so(8) rotation generators out of the  and  and verify that, with the relative factors of (7.3),
i is indeed an so(8) vector. we do not pursue this here.

27

8.1. integration over bosonic zero modes

in section 6.2 we constructed four non-trivial zero modes for the bosonic elds. in

addition to these modes there are eight constant bosonic zero modes corresponding to

shifting the whole string conguration through the eight dimensional transverse space.

integration over these zero modes leads to transverse momentum conservation.

the non-trivial bosonic zero modes of (6.4)(6.5) correspond to translations of the
branchpoints. two of the possible four modes, b = b =  and b = b = i correspond to
translation of the whole classical solution in the  and  directions respectively. integration
over the rst of these modes leads to conservation of the light cone energy, p. integration
over the second leads to invariance under shift of 

the two others correspond to the relative displacement of the branch points. the

integral over these modes is not suppressed by a gaussian term in the action. we thus

have to integrate over them carefully.

let us denote by wr = r + ir the point in moduli space of the four string scattering
diagram. it species the relative displacement of the branchpoints with respect to each

other. the point wr = 0 is the saddle point world sheet. for small wr we can identify
wr with the parameters b and b of (6.10) i.e. wr = b = b. denote xc(w, wr) the
classical matrix string eld conguration corresponding to the point wr. varying wr from
wr to wr + wr takes us from one classical conguration to another. the change of elds
corresponding to this deformation are, by the equations of motion, zero modes of the

quadratic operator;

y (w, wr) = r xc(w, wr)

and

y(w, wr) = r xc(w, wr).

(8.1)

however, zero modes which tend to a non-zero constant value asymptotically far down a

string will not decouple from the action. the background eld conguration (2.9) is linear
in  and in integrating the kinetic term ((xc + y ))2 by parts one picks up a boundary
term, which couples the zero mode linearly to the classical background. for the saddle

point world sheet conguration the zero mode corresponding to relative displacement of

the branch points tends to zero asymptotically down the strings, and hence does decouple.

this is another way of seeing that the background is a stationary point of the action. it

also indicates that one needs to switch from integrating over this mode to integrating over

the modular parameter wr.

a general eld conguration can be decomposed in two ways. we can set wr = 0,
i.e. start with the saddle point classical conguration, and expand using a complete set

28

of modes about this background. alternatively we can keep wr as a free complex variable

and expand in the set of modes excluding the zero modes y and y of (8.1). we thus

have the identity

ynyn(w, 0)

x(w) =xc(w, 0) +xn
=xc(w, wr) + xn6= 

ynyn(w, 0).

(8.2)

we know the integration measure for the rst decomposition.

it is determined by the

condition.

z (dy )e<y |y > = 1 with < y |y  >=

1

22 z d2wtr[ y (w)y (w) + y (w)y (w)].

(8.3)

substituting in the rst decomposition of (8.2) we nd the zero mode measure

z (dy )0 =z yq

dyq(cid:12)(cid:12)det < yq|yr >(cid:12)(cid:12)

1

2 .

(8.4)

to obtain the integration measure for the second decomposition we need to calculate

the jacobian for passing from integration variables x ,x and xn to integration variables
r,r and xn, (n 6= , ).

from (8.2) we have the identity

xn

ynyn(w) = x(w, wr)  x(w, 0) + xn6=,

ynyn(w),

(8.5)

where the sums are over all modes. taking inner products we can relate the two sets of

variables

y =

y =

yn =

< y|x(w, wr)  x(w, 0) >

< y|y >

< y|x(w, wr)  x(w, 0) >

< yn|x(w, wr)  x(w, 0) >

< y|y >

< yn|yn >

(8.6)

+ yn

for n 6= , 

the jacobian for passing from one set of variables to the other is seen to be given by the

nite dimensional determinant

j = det(cid:18) r y

r y

r y

r y(cid:19)  1,

29

(8.7)

where we have used (8.5)(8.1) to see that, to lowest order, j = 1. corrections to this
approximation form a power series in  and . in the domain of validity of the one loop

approximation, where the momenta p are very large, these terms can be dropped since the

integrals over  and  are entirely dominated by their quadratic corrections to the minimal

action. the conclusion is that the integration measure for the collective coordinates  and

 and for the other zero modes is exactly as for (8.4) except with dy replaced by dr and
dy replaced by dr :

z (dy )0 =z drdr yq6=,

dyq(cid:12)(cid:12)det < yq|yr >(cid:12)(cid:12)

1

2 .

(8.8)

by the choice of the decomposition (8.2) the only dependence of the amplitude on the

relative displacements r and r is through the classical action. expanding the classical
action up to quadratic order in r and r the integrations over r and r can then be
performed. the integrals have to be evaluated by the method of steepest descent (see [12])

leading to a factor of i, the nal result being

z drdr es(wr) = i

c

e 1

4 (s log s+t log t+u log u),

(8.9)

with s,t and u the lorentz invariants dened in (2.30)(2.31). the non-lorentz invariant

factor c is given, up to numerical factors, by

c = s2n 2

where z+
0 are the two branch point positions in the complex z plane. they are
determined by the quadratic equation (2.6) written with the standard choice z1 = 0, z2 = 1,
z3 = , z4 = .

8.2. integration over gauge eld and ghost zero modes

there are three nontrivial gauge boson modes (6.2) , corresponding to the fact that

a generic gauge eld zero mode takes on four dierent values, ai
ni

, down the four strings,

subject to the constraint pi iai = 0.

as for the bosonic zero modes of the previous section their integration measure includes

a determinant of their inner products.

z (dv )0 =

2 (a1 + a2  a3  a4),

(8.11)

dai (cid:12)(cid:12)det < vi|vj >(cid:12)(cid:12)

30

where the determinant is a three by three determinant and can be calculated by choosing

any linearly independent basis for the vi. one such basis would be to say that vi (i = 1, 2, 3)
is the mode which tends to 1 down the ith string, tends to 1 down the fourth string and
tends to zero down the others. the integrals only go up to ai = gs since there is a globally
well dened gauge transformation that identies ai = gs with ai = 0. specically for the
string i the globally dened unitary matrix is u = ei/ni.

integrating over the gauge eld zero modes gives rise to the contribution

(2gs)3 (cid:12)(cid:12)det < vi|vj >(cid:12)(cid:12)

1

2 .

(8.12)

there is a single ghost eld zero mode, the constant mode. it comes from the fact

that there is a globally constant u (1) gauge transformation. to understand how to deal

with this mode, let us look carefully at the fadeev popov representation of the gauge xing

determinant. we insert into the functional integral the factor of 1 written as

1 =  z (du )(f  dv (u)



),

where r (du ) is the haar measure for the integral over the unitary group and v (u)

gauge transformation of v with respect to u . the prime on the functional delta function
means that the constant mode is excluded. by the standard argument, once this factor is



inserted into the functional integral, a gauge transformation allows one to factor out the

volume factor r (du ) which one can then divide out, and one is left with just the jacobian

factor . f in (8.13) is some arbitrary function which can be integrated over with gaussian

weight to induce the standard gauge xing term (3.7).

to evaluate  we expand the unitary integral about the point where the argument of

the delta function is zero. we then have, under a gauge transformation,

v = igsu du = d with u = e i

gs

.

(8.14)

we now write , the unitary integral r (du ) and the functional delta function in terms of

modes.

(8.13)

is the

31

we have used the at space denition of the measure (8.4) for the functional integral over

|n| =< n|n >

1

2 .

(8.16)

in the expression for the delta function of (8.15) a and b are arbitrary functions which

we have expanded in terms of the modes n, i.e. a() = pn ann() and similarly for

b. note that there is nothing special about the decomposition into the modes n, any
(orthogonal) set of modes can be used.

substituting in the expressions (8.15) into (8.13) we nd

1 =  z d0|0| yn6=0

< n|n >
< n|d2|n >

.

(8.17)

the integral over 0 is decoupled from the functional delta function and hence is not
localized. it corresponds to a global u (1) rotation and from (8.14) we see that it must

be integrated over the nite interval [0, 2gs]. the product(determinant) in (8.17) can be
represented in the standard way by introducing a ghost action and integrating over all

ghost modes except the zero mode. we thus have

 =

1

2gs| < 0|0 > | 1

2 z (dcdc)er tr[cd2c],

(8.18)

where the prime indicates that the integral excludes the zero mode. the combined contri-

bution from the ghost and gauge zero modes is thus

(2gs)2(cid:20) det < vi|vj >
< 0|0 > (cid:21)

2

.

(8.19)

the factor of g2

s is the correct gs dependence expected from string theory with each branch

point contributing a factor of gs.

as was originally argued in [9] the zero mode structure of the abelian gauge and ghost

elds will always generate the correct gs weight for the topology of the string diagram.

8.3. integration over fermion zero modes

in section 6 we constructed eight non-trivial fermion zero modes which tended

to constant but dierent values asymptotically far down each of the four strings

((6.11)(6.12)(6.13)(6.14)). in addition there are eight constant fermion zero modes taking

32

the same value on each string, n . we thus see that the fermion zero mode down the ith

string can be written as

=

1
ni

i

i p + nin
pi p + ni n
pi p + ni n

(8.20)

we now integrate over the fermion zero modes including a graviton wavefunction for each

of the four strings. since the left and right moving sectors of the fermionic integrals are

identical we only need focus on one of them. we have the following zero mode integral for

the left moving sector

n z d8

yi=1

i(i, i, i)

with

z d8 =z d2p d2 p d2n d2 n

 1
2

n =(cid:12)(cid:12)det < n|n >(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(8.21)

n is the normalization for the zero mode integral. it follows from the fermionic equivalent
of (8.3). the wavefunctions are given in (7.2) and the zero modes i and i are given in
terms of p,p,n , and n through equation (8.20). the fermionic integrals will pick out
from the product of wavefunctions precisely two p, two p, two n and two n . using the
fact that the wavefunctions break into three subspaces (7.3) the fermionic integrals pick

out of the product of wavefunctions six dierent types of contribution. in other words,

under the fermionic integrals we have the identity

i(i, i, i) =

each of these six contributions has to be evaluated separately. the calculations are lengthy

but straightforward. the appendix lists the identities necessary to derive the results and

presents the rst calculation in detail. it also gives essential intermediate results to aid

verication of the ve other calculations. although the calculations are not particularly

enlightening in themselves, the reader is nevertheless urged to turn to the appendix to

convince him(her)self that it is highly non-trivial that the fermion zero mode integrations

produce the ten dimensionally lorentz invariant results enumerated below. in this section

33

we will simply state the results, referring the reader to the appendix for all details of the
calculations.

we start by considering the case in which all polarization vectors are in the
x 5,x 6,x 7,x 8 space. performing the fermionic integrations we nd, after several pages of
algebra, (see appendix) that we can express the nal result in terms of lorentz invariant
quatities. specically we nd

(5678) = (cid:2)ut(1.2)(3.4) + st(1.3)(2.4) + su(1.4)(2.4)(cid:3),

(8.23)

where s, t and u are the ten dimensional lorentz invariants given in (2.30)(2.31). this is
of the form expected for all four polarization vectors orthogonal to the momenta. (see for
example [25][19])

the next case considered is that in which all four polarization tensors lie in the x 3,x 4
space. integrating over the grassman variables one nds, after several pages of algebra (see
the appendix for essential details) that the result can also be expressed in terms of lorentz
invariants. the nal result reads

using the identity (2.32) and the denitions for  and  of (7.3) it is straightforward to

focusing next on the case with two polarizations in the x 5,x 6,x 7,x 8 space and two
in the x 3,x 4 space we nd that there are six types of contribution depending on the way
the pairs of polarizations are divided amongst the four strings. performing the fermionic
integrations we nd after a long calculation (see the appendix for essential results) that
the results can be expressed in the lorentz invariant form

form (8.23).
x 3,x 4,x 5,x 6,x 7,x 8 space, i.e.

in conclusion we see that for arbitrary polarization vectors lying in the

transverse to the momenta, the result can always be

written in the form (8.23).

we still have to evaluate the fermion integrals for the three cases where two or more
polarizations are in the x 1,x 2 plane. we begin with the case in which all four polarizations
lie in the x 1,x 2 plane. evaluating the fermion integrals we nd a relatively simple result

(see the appendix). the result can then be shown to be equal to the lorentz invariant

quantity given below.

(8.26)

the vector products are the lorentz invariant vector products, with ki the ten vectors
of momenta (2.25) and  the ten vectors of polarization which include a  part given

by equation (7.6). to verify equation (8.26) one substitutes into the right hand side the

mometum ten vectors (2.25) and polarization ten vectors (7.5)(7.6). the complicated form

of the right hand side of (8.26) can then be shown to reduce down to the simple result

given in the appendix.

it is recommended to use a computer algebra program such as

mathematica to check this.

the result (8.26) is precisely the four graviton kinematic factor calculated in string

theory [25][19]. it is totally symmetric under interchange of the strings and is further-

more gauge invariant. in other words if one replaces any one polarization tensor by the

corresponding momenta the result is zero.

next we treat the cases in which two polarizations lie in the x 1,x 2 plane and two
in the x 3,x 4 plane. there are six dierent possible ways of distributing the two types of

polarization amongst the four strings. computing the fermionic integrals one arrives at

35

some relatively simple expressions (see the appendix). it is then straightforward to show

that they can be expressed in the lorentz invariant form listed below.

these are again of the form (8.26).

finally for the case with two polarizations in the x 1,x 2 plane and two in the sub-
space x 5,x 6,x 7,x 8 we nd (see appendix) identical results to those of (8.27) with the

wavefunctions (34) replaced by (5678).

the result of this analysis is that an arbitrary physical polarization vector, determined

by its components in the eight dimensional transverse space, leads to the lorentz invariant

result of equation (8.26). the restoration of the full so(8) invariance of the theory was to

be expected from a correct quantization of the theory, but the extension of this invariance

to ten dimensional lorentz invariance seems to be a very non-trivial test of matrix string

theory.

8.4. the four graviton scattering amplitude

combining the integrals over the left and right moving fermion zero modes, the bosonic

and gauge zero mode integrals and the determinant from the non zero modes of section 4

we arrive at the nal result for the four string scattering amplitude :

det < vi|vj > det < yq|yr >(cid:21)

,

(8.29)

where c is the non-lorentz invariant quantity dened in (8.10). we have shown in section
4 that the uctuation determinant j does not receive any singular contributions from the
branch points. we further argued that up to small corrections the bosonic and fermionic
determinants would cancel, but we do not know how to evaluate j more precisely. we
can, however, take some inspiration from conformal eld theory. in cft it is well known

that the nite determinants for the zero modes combine with determinants from the non-

zero modes to give a result (in the critical dimension) that is conformally invariant. the

heat kernel methods used to show this (see for example [26]) do not generalise in any

obvious way to the determinants calculated in this paper. it seems likely, however, that

a similar mechanism is at work for the combination of determinants of (8.29). it is also

possible that the non-lorentz invariant factor c can be absorbed, in a natural way, into

the normalizations of the zero modes.

if this is the case then, up to an overall numerical factor, we have reproduced from

matrix string theory the high energy limit of the string theory scattering amplitude for

four gravitons [25][19][11][12].

9. discussion and conclusions

in the previous section we have performed an analysis of graviton scattering. this

formalism can however be extended in a straightforward way to wavefunctions involv-

ing fermionic ground states for the left and/or right moving sectors. these would be

constructed from odd numbers of , and would permit the construction of the complete

multiplet of massless states of the type iia superstring.

 i thank herman verlinde for emphasising the importance of this eect in cft and for

suggesting that a similar mechanism could play a role here.

9.1. summary of the general calculational procedure

we study scattering amplitudes which in string theory are dominated by the points in

moduli space corresponding to saddle points of the classical action. we focused on the tree

level contribution, but in string theory there is a whole tower of saddle point world sheets
of higher topology that also contribute. the methods developed in this paper should

be directly applicable to these higher genus contributions. let us summarize the general

procedure.

the classical matrix string solutions corresponding to the saddle point world sheets

are used as background eld congurations. the quantum uctuations around the back-

grounds are treated by a one loop calculation. this consists of a zero mode part and a

uctuation determinant for the non-zero modes. all the essential structure of the am-

plitude is contained in the zero mode integrations which can be calculated exactly. to

nd the zero modes one rst uses the fact that around the interaction points there are

instanton like eld congurations. locally these break the translation symmetry and part

of the supersymmetry. each broken symmetry has a corresponding zero mode. they are

given by equations (5.13)(5.19)

v = f

and  = f  .

(9.1)

where f is the background eld strength written in ten dimensional notation (see section
3.2). in addition there are zero modes for the two dimensional gauge eld. they can be

written as

v = dxi,

(9.2)

where xi is any of the non zero background bosonic elds. the zero mode eld cong-
urations (9.1)(9.2) are nite at the interaction points. since, however, the background

bosonic eld congurations xi correspond to world sheets branch points, the zero modes
(9.1)(9.2) will behave, asymptotically far from the branch point, like singular string world

sheet zero modes, with the singularity sitting at the branch point. these modes can be

glued into global world sheet zero modes.

the important point about the construction of these global zero modes is that they

only depend on the existence of a nite instanton like classical solution around the branch

point, not on the precise details of the eld conguration.

 in the original analysis of gross and mende [11][12] it was found that the perturbation series

was strongly divergent with genus g world sheets giving a contribution proportional to g9g.

38

for any world sheet it should be possible to identify, using (9.1)(9.2), the allowed

singularities of the zero modes at the branch points and hence to construct the global zero

modes.

integration over the gauge eld zero modes, along with the single, constant, ghost

eld zero mode, leads to the correct power of gs for the string world sheet[9]. the global

bosonic zero modes correspond to the collective coordinates for the positions of the branch

points. integration over the global fermion zero modes gives the ten dimensionally lorentz

invariant kinematic structure of the scattering amplitude. this we have has explicitly

veried for the case of four graviton scattering.

9.2. connection with light cone superstring calculations

the matrix string calculations described above have a strong resemblance to the func-

tional integral methods used in light cone superstring calculations (see the review article

[23]). below we discuss the similarities and dierences between the two.

in light cone superstring calculations the functional integral reduces down to an inte-

gration over zero modes. there are, however, no zero modes corresponding to the trans-

lation of the branch point and no abelian gauge eld and so no gauge or ghost eld zero

modes. the inclusion of factors of gs and the integrals over the string moduli are added

by hand.

to perform the euclidean functional integral the minkowski space majorana-weyl

fermions are combined into complex fermionic coordinates and their conjugate momenta.

these can be dened by the same formula as for matrix string theory i.e. equation (3.2).
this breaks the spin(8) symmetry down to u (1)  su (4). the  and  of (3.2) form a 4
of su (4) and the  and  form a 4.

in the matrix string theory calculation, there is a classical background, that through

the non-abelian nature of the theory, interacts with the fermions and further breaks the

su (4) symmetry. in the four string scattering process discussed in this paper the original
spin(8) symmetry is broken down to u (1)  u (1)  su (2)  su (2). other classical back-
grounds, for example ve or six string scattering, would break the spin(8) symmetry even

further.

in light cone superstring calculations the fermionic coordinates  and momenta  have

the conformal weights 1 and 0 respectively. the functional integral over the fermions leads

to a determinant and to an integration over the  zero modes. these are given by the

39

complete set of abelian dierentials dened on the string diagram riemann surface. in

terms of the light cone world sheet coordinate w, they consist of all the modes satisfying

w = 0.

(9.3)

we denote by  in (9.3) the 4 of su (4) made from  and  of (3.2). there is also the
complex conjugate equation for the 4. the modes satisfying (9.3) are allowed to have

1/w  w0 singularities at each simple branch point w0, and have the boundary condition

that they tend to constant values asymptotically far down the strings. the generic fermion

zero mode thus has a singularity at each branch point. this is in contrast to the matrix

string zero modes of section 6.3 which each had a single singularity even though there were

two branch points. in other words, for this process, there are twice as many fermion zero

modes in the light cone superstring calculation as there are in the matrix string calculation.

this mismatch is resolved by the nal element of light cone superstring calculations :
the addition by hand, at each branch point of an operator v needed to preserve supersym-
metry. the precise form of this operator for simple branch points (i.e. where two strings

interact) was calculated in [22]. it can be written in the form

v = 

4
z w(z)|

|22

(zx i, z, z ) (zx i, z , z

).

(9.4)

where ( , , ) is as in (7.2) except with p+ replaced by 1/(22
z w(z)), and in the right
moving part ( , , ) p+ is replaced by 1/(22
z w(z)). w is the light cone coordinate
expressed, through the mandelstam mapping, in terms of the uniformization z (for tree
level scattering see equation (2.5)). the bosonic elds x in the operators v are contracted
both with the external wavefunctions and with the other v. the fermions  are the fermion
zero modes. it is straightforward to see that the two interaction operators used for the

four string scattering amplitude soak up the excess zero modes.

9.3. conclusions and future directions

the matrix string zero mode calculation of this paper is considerably simpler than

that for the light cone superstring, where an interaction operator has to be introduced

by hand at each interaction point. so far, however, the matrix string calculations have

only been carried out about a classical background corresponding to a saddle point of the

classical action. it is important to extend them to other backgrounds. in the context of

the four-string scattering calculation, it is clear that there is a problem when the world

40

sheet is no longer a stationary point of the action. in this case, the world sheet is not

(anti)holomorphic around the branch points and the corresponding instanton solution will

break all of the supersymmetry leading to extra fermion zero modes. there must be a

simple mechanism that soaks up these extra zero modes. it is important to understand

this as it could permit the calculations to be done at an arbitrary point in moduli space.

the semi-classical analysis of this paper has been justied by focusing on very high

energy scattering processes. away from this limit we do not know how to calculate. there

will however be an eective action describing the low energy uctuations, even if we do

not at present have the technical tools to obtain it. the zero mode analysis of this paper

only depends on the existence of a nite eld conguration for the interaction points, and

should also be applicable to this eective eld theory.

finally it is interesting to speculate on how the semi-classical reasoning of this paper

could be made more rigorous. in simpler situations, semiclassical methods have recently

been shown to be in precise agreement with exact results. using quasi-classics, the partition

function for matrix string theory on a torus was calculated [27] and shown to agree, on

extrapolation to the small torus limit, with the exact results for the completely reduced

sym theory [28]. these latter results were obtained by mapping the original sym theory

to a cohomological eld theory (cohft) using the methods of [29]. recently cohft

methods have been applied directly to the matrix string partition function [30] beautifully

conrming the semi-classical results of [27]. a key aspect of cohft is that the functional

integral localizes on congurations of the classical vacua. although it is not possible to

apply the twisting procedures used in [29][28][30] to matrix string scattering processes it is

tempting to speculate that some kind of localization mechanism is also behind the success

of the calculations presented in this paper.

where the indices a and a which run from one to eight label the 8s and 8c representations
of spin(8) respectively. the i

a a (which are the transposes of the i

1 = 1  1  1

(1.2)

where  = i2 and 1,2 and 3 are the pauli matrices. with this basis the gamma matrices
0,9,1 and 2 are given by

(1.3)

where all entries correspond to 8x8 blocks with the pauli matrix 2 being written as 4x4
blocks.

with respect to these four gamma matrices the sixteen component majorana-weyl

spinors thus decompose into four blocks of four. we will be working in euclidean space

where ten dimensional majorana-weyl spinors do not exist. furthermore, as discussed in

section 3 each majorana-weyl fermionic variable is simultaneously a fermionic coordinate

and its conjugate momenta. we thus have to combine the fermionic variables into complex

fermionic coordinates and their distinct conjugate momenta. it is thus convenient to work

with a complex basis of gamma matrices dened by

  (v  v  1)(v  v  1) with v =

4 = i2  2  2
6 =  i1  3  1
8 =  i1  3  3,

(1.4)

(1.5)

in the basis of (1.5) the four gamma matrices that appear in the background covariant
dirac operator are identical to those of (1.3) except for 2 where 2 is replaced by 3.
finally it is useful for the study of the fermion zero modes and determinant to put the dirac

operator into block diagonal form by mixing the two spin(8) representations. specically,

42

writing the sixteen by sixteen  matrices as four by four blocks, we interchange the second
and third rows and columns. this leads to the following block diagonal form for the gamma
matrices 0,9,1 and 2

0 =(cid:18) 1 0

0 1(cid:19) 9 =(cid:18) 3

fermion action given in (3.9).

the fermion coordinates and momenta under rotations in the x 1,x 2 and x 3,x 4 planes
and in the four dimensional space x 5,x 6,x 7 and x 8 can be read o from the explicit form

since the space x 5,x 6,x 7,x 8 has euclidean metric.

there are two pairs of two component spinors, a and  b with a, b = 1, 2. indices

using the identities of the previous section the calculations of the fermion integrals

of section 8, are straightforward but somewhat tedious.

for them we just give some essential intermediate results.

there are two p, two p, two n and two n . in other words each non-zero contribution

will consist of two factors of transverse momenta p, two factors of transverse momenta
p and four factors of p+ momenta n . we thus see that there are three dierent types

of integrals to be calculated according to how the four ps and four n s are distributed

amongst the four wavefunctions. specically we have

i = i1 + i2 + i3

using the identities (2.28),(2.29) and (2.31) to evaluate the above result for the six possible

combinations of pairs of polarizations leads to the results listed in (8.25).

the other three i(i, j; k, l) can be obtained by taking complex conjugates of the above
results.

substituting in the ten vectors for the momenta and polarizations into the lorentz

invariant expression (8.26) one can show that the expression (8.26) is equal (3.15)(3.17).
it is crucial, to obtain this equality to include in the polarization vectors the non-zero 

part (see equation (7.6)).

plane we have

where again  is a sign factor which is equal to +1 if i, j = 1, 2 or 3, 4 and 1 otherwise.
it comes from the sign of the p+ momenta in the denitions of the wavefunctions (7.3).
evaluating the fermionic integrals and using the identities (2.28), (2.29) and (2.31) one

nds that

i(i; j|k; l) = i(i; j|l; k) and i(i; j|k; l) = i(j; i|k; l),

by substituting in the ten vectors for the momenta and polarizations into the lorentz

invariant expressions (8.27) one can show that the expressions of (8.27) are equal to those
of (3.18)(3.21). again it is crucial to include in the polarization vectors the non-zero 
part (see equation (7.6)) to obtain agreement.

finally we turn to the case with two polarizations in the x 1,x 2 plane and two in the

x 5,x 6,x 7,x 8 subspace. for this case the fermionic integrals read

(3.23)

evaluating the integrals the results are found to be identical to those of (3.21), i.e. we

have

i(i; j) =

1
2i(i; j|k; l),

(3.24)

where the i(i; j|k; l) (which have k, l 6= i, j) are given by the expressions of (3.21).
