abstract

the general criteria for nding bosonic supersymmetric worldvolume
solitons is reviewed. we concentrate on d-branes, discussing in partic-
ular, bion/dyon solutions and d3 branes on ns5 backgrounds.

introduction. brane eective actions constitute a relativistic exten-
sion of supersymmetric eld theories, in the sense that the energy density
functional e satises e 2 = f (i), which upon linearisation matches the
conventional susy free eld theory result. this observation suggests that
all supersymmetric eld theories might be realized in terms of branes and
their intersections. it is desirable to establish a complete classication
of their classical solutions, especially the bps ones that will receive no
quantum corrections but contribute to the path integral.

a universal feature of all these eective actions is the existence of
a fermionic gauge symmetry called kappa symmetry. the latter is not
only responsible of removing half of the fermionic degrees of freedom,
but it also restricts the background geometry to be compatible with the
supergravity equations of motion and relates spacetime supersymmetry
with worldvolume supersymmetry. in particular, any bosonic supersym-
metric conguration should satisfy [1] :

  = 

(1.1)

where  is the matrix appearing in -symmetry transformations, satis-
2 = 1 and tr  = 0, while  is an arbitrary linear combination
fying 
of killing spinors of the background. the number of supersymmetries
preserved by the combined background/brane system is the number of

1

2

linearly independent solutions of (1.1). notice that if the background
admits no killing spinors, the worldvolume theory will never be super-
symmetric.

it is important to stress that (1.1) is equivalent to the calibration
approach [2] for those branes with no excited gauge eld living on their
worldvolumes. this is the reason why we will concentrate on dp-branes
whose  matrix can be written as a p + 1-form (d-form) :

qdet (g + f )  = ef 

mn=0

(2d1+()d)/4

condition (1.1) depends on the background (ea

m, bmn, ) and on the
conguration (x m, a). once the background is xed, its solution will
not only determine the number of independent components of  but will
provide us with an equation(s), that will play the role of bps equa-
tion(s), relating the dierent excited elds. once the bps equation(s) is
known, one can always write the square of the energy density as a sum
of positive denite terms that allow us to nd some bound on the energy
[3]. it is precisely when the bps equation(s) is satised that the bound
is saturated. since the energy is minimised, it is no longer necessary to
check the equations of motion, but the gauss law and/or the bianchi
identity, that will determine the equation of motion for the remaining
independent excited elds.

bions. let us consider dp-branes probing dp-branes geometry (1 
p  7). the background is given by

ds2 = u 1/2 ds2(m(1,p)) + u 1/2 ds2(e9p)
e = u (3p)/4

c0...p = u 1

(1.2)

(1.3)

where the gauge choice for the r-r potential is consistent with the no
force condition existing between parallel dp-branes and u is an harmonic
function in the transverse space to the branes.

to describe a f-string ending on a probe parallel to a stack of dp-
branes (x  =  ,  = 0, . . . , p), we must excite a transverse scalar
(y = y (a) , a = 1, . . . , p) and the electric components of the gauge eld
a0 = a0(a), since the f-string is an electrically charged ns-ns object.
it is natural to demmand 0...pp (2d+1()d )/4
0 = 0 and 0y110 = 0
for type iia and 0y30 = 0 for type iib, on the assymptotic value
of the killing spinor (0), since these are the conditions describing the
existence of a dp-brane and a f-string, respectively.

when eq. (1.1) is subject to the above constraints, it is solved i

f0a = ay  ea = abby

(1.4)

where ea is the conjugate momentum of the gauge eld. (1.4) is the
bps equation as it can be checked by analysing the energy density [4]
of the conguration

(e + u 1)2 = (u 1 + eaay )2 + u 1| ea  abby |2 .

(1.5)

the gauss law (a ea = 0) determines the eq. of motion (ababy =
0) for the excited scalar.
its solution and the corresponding physical
interpretation depend on the worldvolume dimension.

due to the self-duality of g(5) = d c(4), one should expect dyonic
solutions in the case of d3-branes. the soliton condition on 0 is modied
to 0y(cos  3 +sin  1)0 = 0, while (1.1) is solved i f0a = cos  ay
and ba = sin  abby . the excitation of the magnetic eld is consistent
with the charge carried by the d-strings.

the latter analysis could be extended to d8-branes, since there is no
new contribution due to the mass parameter for the congurations under
study.

d3-branes in ns5 backgrounds. let us consider a d3-brane prob-
ing ns5-branes geometry. the background is given by :

ds2 = ds2(m1,5) + u (cid:16)dr2 + r2 d2
3(cid:17)

e2 = u , h(3) = 2r2 (3)

(1.6)

(1.7)

we will describe the s-dual conguration to the one considered in [5]
(to which we refer for notation), but from the d3-brane perspective. the
d3-brane wraps the transverse s3 sphere and the ns5-branes mag-
netic charge induces a magnetic charge on the probe through a d-string
soliton connecting both. in this way, the assymptotic killing spinor 0
should satisfy 0...5 30 = 0, 023 i20 = 0 and 0r 10 = 0,
that correspond to the background, probe and soliton susy projection
conditions.

due to the polar coordinates on e4,  is not constant. proceeding as

in [5], eq. (1.1) is solved if :

gabbr

ba = 
b =

(r sin )  (r cos )  gab arb(r sin )


r

(1.8)

where  = u r2 det g and ba = 1
2 abcfbc. eqs. (1.8) are the bps
equations as can be checked by writting the energy density as a sum of
squares :

e 2 = |r ba +  gabbr|2 +(cid:0)baa(r sin ) + (r cos )(cid:1)2 + z 2(1.9)
z = (r sin )  baa(r cos )
(1.10)
the bianchi identity df = d b, which is equivalent to aba =
2r2 det g, not only gives the corresponding equation of motion for
the excited radial scalar, but it is also useful to check the topological
character of z which can be written as z = az a, where

z a = bar cos 
z  = br cos  +pdet g sin   r3

+ rr2!

(1.11)

(1.12)

a similar analysis to the one carried in [5] shows that for so(2) in-
variant congurations, the above soliton gives a worldvolume realization
of the hannany-witten eect.
