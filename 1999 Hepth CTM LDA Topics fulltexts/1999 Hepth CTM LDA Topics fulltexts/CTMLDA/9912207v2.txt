abstract

in this paper we complete the derivations of nite volume partition functions for qcd using
random matrix theories by calculating the eective low-energy partition function for three-
dimensional qcd in the adjoint representation from a random matrix theory with the same
global symmetries. as expected, this case corresponds to dyson index  = 4, that is, the dirac
operator can be written in terms of real quaternions. after discussing the issue of dening ma-
jorana fermions in euclidean space, the actual matrix model calculation turns out to be simple.
we nd that the symmetry breaking pattern is o(2nf )  o(nf )  o(nf ), as expected from the
correspondence between symmetric (super)spaces and random matrix universality classes found
by zirnbauer. we also derive the rst leutwylersmilga sum rule.

introduction

the recent strong interest in the low-energy limit of the qcd spectrum originates in the banks-
casher relation [1]

 =

(0)

v

(1.1)

relating the density of eigenvalues of the dirac operator at the origin, (0), to the order parameter
for spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, the quark condensate , in the thermodynamic and
chiral limits (v here is the size of the box). it is expected on the basis of lattice qcd simulations
that chiral symmetry will be restored above some critical temperature and/or chemical potential.
by studying the dirac spectrum in the infrared limit, one hopes to obtain analytical information
about the chiral phase transition.

the presence of gauge elds alters the distribution of the dirac eigenvalues. for free quarks in 4d
the spacing between eigenvalues is  v 1/4, whereas for interacting quarks it is  v 1. moreover,
it is known that the dirac eigenvalues derived from qcd in a nite volume are constrained by sum
rules rst discovered by leutwyler and smilga [2]. these sum rules are obtained by expanding
the partition function in powers of the quark mass m before and after averaging over the gauge
eld congurations, and matching powers of m.

the same sum rules can also be obtained from a random matrix theory with the same global
symmetries as the qcd partition function. this was rst noticed in [3]. in the random matrix
theory (where the size of the random matrices n is identied with the space-time volume v ),
the average over gauge eld congurations is substituted by an average over gaussian distributed
random matrices with the same structure of matrix elements as the euclidean space dirac operator
d. the matrix elements can be real, complex or quaternion real, corresponding to dyson
indices  = 1, 2, 4 respectively. the corresponding matrix models are called the (chiral) gaussian
orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensembles.

in fact, the extreme infrared limit of the qcd partition function maps onto the same eective
partition function (usually called the nite volume partition function) as the random matrix
theory [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. in retrospect this is not too surprising, since the chiral lagrangian to
lowest order in the quark momenta is completely determined by the pattern of chiral symmetry
breaking and lorentz invariance. in the so-called mesoscopic range 1
 , where l
is the side of the box and c
 is the compton wavelength of the goldstone modes, this partition
function expresses the quark mass dependence in the static limit and in a nite volume. it is
expressed as an integral over the goldstone manifold of the composite variables corresponding
to the pion elds and it is a function of one scaling variable n m, where m is a mass matrix

qcd  l  c

in avor space.
in substituting the complicated average over gauge eld congurations with
an average over random matrices, we have the advantage that we can utilize a well-established
mathematical framework that had its beginnings with the pioneering works in the eld by wigner,
dyson and mehta.

the sum rules can be expressed using the so-called microscopic spectral density s(), dened
by magnifying the distribution of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the origin ( = 0) on the scale of
the average eigenvalue spacing. s() is a highly universal quantity [3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13]. it is
completely determined by the global symmetries of the partition function, and does not depend
on the matrix potential, for example.

however, the sum rules are not sucient for determining the spectral density itself. fortunately,
the dirac spectrum can be obtained using the so called partially quenched partition function for
qcd [14], in which one introduces bosonic and fermionic valence quark species in addition to the
ordinary quarks. when the bosonic and fermionic valence quark masses coincide the partially
quenched partition function coincides with the original qcd partition function. for a nice review
of this approach see also [15].

the cases corresponding to fundamental fermions with gauge group su (2), fundamental fermions
with gauge group su (nc) (nc  3), and adjoint fermions with gauge group su (nc) (nc  2)
(labeled respectively by  = 1, 2, 4) in four dimensions, and the corresponding cases labeled by
 = 1, 2 in three dimensions have been analyzed in [5, 7, 9]. in this paper we will treat the only
missing case, namely three-dimensional qcd in the adjoint representation. we take the color
gauge group to be su (nc) with nc  2. this case will correspond to a matrix model labeled by
 = 4, as we will nd that the dirac operator is quaternion real, that is, that its matrix elements
can be written in the form qkl = a0
kl are real numbers, 1 is the 2  2 unit
matrix and ~ the triplet of pauli matrices. like for all the other cases, we will propose a gaussian
random matrix theory corresponding to the low-energy partition function by substituting the
integral over gauge elds with an integral over a random, quaternion real matrix. by expressing
the fermion determinant as an integral over grassmann variables (utilizing the supersymmetric
formalism developed in [16]), we will then perform the gaussian integration corresponding in the
eld theory to the average over gauge elds. after manipulating the partition function further
and eventually performing the grassmann integration, we will obtain the nite volume partition
function. from this partition function the pattern of spontaneous avor symmetry breaking
(assuming that such breaking takes place) will emerge. we will assume from the outset that
there is a nonzero condensate . the discrete parity symmetry discussed below and in [7, 9, 17]
remains unbroken. (for a more detailed discussion of this issue see these references.)

to begin, let us consider the minkowski space lagrangian for qcd in the adjoint representation

l = 

trf 2 +

1

2nf

xf =1

f (i 6d  mf )f

(2.2)

where f is the gauge eld tensor, 6d  d, d is the covariant derivative for the adjoint
representation given explicitly in (4.12), and mf is the quark mass corresponding to avor f . for
reasons that will become evident, we call the total number of avors 2nf . f are quark spinors
in the adjoint representation and f is the avor index (the indices corresponding to color and
spin are suppressed).

the lowest-dimensional representation of  is given by the pauli matrices 0 = 3, 1 = i1,
2 = i2. in this 2d representation, there is no chiral symmetry, since there is no 2  2 matrix
that anticommutes with the k.

for zero masses mf , the above lagrangian is invariant under parity p , dened in three dimensions
by

(t, x1, x2)  1(t, x1, x2)
a0(t, x1, x2)  a0(t, x1, x2)
a1(t, x1, x2)  a1(t, x1, x2)
a2(t, x1, x2)  a2(t, x1, x2)

(2.3)

the mass term breaks this p invariance. however, by choosing half of the masses equal to +m
and half equal to m, we can achieve a (p, z2)invariant lagrangian [9, 18].
in terms of 2
spinors, this choice corresponds to nf 2spinors f with mass +m, and nf 2spinors f with
mass m. under p the mass terms for the 2spinors change sign, so that if the two sets of
two-spinors transform into each other in a z2 transformation f  f , f = 1, 2, ..., nf , the total
lagrangian is invariant under the combined transformations p and z2. we can use this choice
of mass term to write down a (p, z2)invariant lagrangian in the adjoint representation:

(2.4)

as we will see in section 4, the given representation of d  in this case the adjoint representation
 uniquely denes (in euclidean space) the anti-unitary operator q that commutes with the dirac
operator i 6d. we will see that for the adjoint representation, the condition q =  leads in the
fermionic partition function to an integral over only half of the number of fermionic degrees of
freedom with respect to the fundamental representation. the condition q =  is therefore
called the majorana condition.

also for  = 1 (fundamental fermions with su (2) color symmetry) we have an anti-unitary
symmetry [i 6d, q] = 0 (with the dierence that q2 = +1, whereas in the adjoint case we have
q2 = 1; see below), which leads to the same kind of relation q = .
in the case of the
fundamental su (2) representation this relation denes a basis in which the dirac operator has
real matrix elements. in the adjoint case, because q2 = 1, we will nd that we can write the
dirac operator in terms of real quaternions (see section 5). in contrast to the adjoint case, in
the fundamental su (2) case we integrate in the partition function over both  and , which are
independent degrees of freedom. this was shown explicitly in section 3 of ref. [9]. for the gauge
groups su (nc) (nc  3) and fundamental fermions, we have no anti-unitary symmetry.

to discuss the theory (2.4) in euclidean space, we rst discuss the general issue of dening
majorana fermions in euclidean space.

3 dening majorana fermions in euclidean space

it is not in general straightforward to dene majorana fermions in euclidean space. in 4d, this is
due to the fact that the would-be majorana fermions do not transform like dirac spinors under
euclidean lorentz-transformations. this in turn is due to the absence, in euclidean space, of an
equation relating the right- and lefthanded lorentz-transformations. for minkowski space there
is such a relation:

2r2 = 
l

(3.5)

this relation guarantees, in 4d minkowski space, that the upper and lower components of the
usual majorana fermions, l and 2
l transform like lefthanded and righthanded components,
respectively. in [5] it was shown that one can nevertheless construct a fermionic partition function

4

for majorana fermions in 4d (or 2d) euclidean space. to begin with, we will here briey recall
how this was done.

given the euclidean dirac operator for adjoint fermions, i6d (dened as usual by 6d = d
where  are euclidean gamma matrices satisfying {,  } = 2 and d ab = ab + fabcac
),
an anti-unitary operator q dened by

was identied. since in 4d it turns out that q2 = 1, the majorana condition

[i 6d, q] = 0

is contradictory (since it implies that  =  and thus  = 0), unless we dene

q = 

 = 

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

this condition is called conjugation of the second kind.
it is common in the literature on
grassmann variables and in calculations involving supersymmetric random matrix theories. if q
commutes with euclidean lorentz-transformations, a partition function for euclidean majorana
fermions can now be dened if we can nd an operator o such that

z = qdet(i 6d) = z d eto i 6d

(3.9)

where  are majorana fermions satisfying q = , det o = 1 and oi6d is an antisymmetric
operator. this last condition guarantees that the square root is well-dened. lorentz-invariance
of this partition function is guaranteed because in addition, we demand that o by construction
satises

t o =   (q)

(3.10)

(we recall that in euclidean space the lorentz-invariant quantity is ). in (3.9) we integrate
over only half of the degrees of freedom with respect to the partition function for the usual dirac
fermions.

5

conversely, the majorana condition can be identied by the condition (3.10), once we have written
down the partition function, by demanding lorentz-invariance of the latter.

4 the fermion determinant

following these hints, we can now construct a partition function for euclidean majorana fermions
in 3d. as it turns out, the problems with dening euclidean majorana fermions that we encounter
in four dimensions, are not present in 3d because the majorana fermions dened by (3.7) transform
correctly under 3d euclidean lorentz-transformations. this is because in 3d, there is just one kind
of 2-spinor and just one two-dimensional representation of the lorentz group, which is equivalent
to the rotation group.

we start by dening hermitian gamma matrices for our 3d euclidean space. they can simply be
taken to be the pauli matrices

0 = 3,

1 = 1,

2 = 2

(4.11)

satisfying {,  } = 2 . the dirac operator in the adjoint representation is

d ab = (ab + iac

(tc)ab) = (ab + fabcac
)

(4.12)

where fabc are real structure constants for the gauge group. d is antisymmetric under transpo-
sition and 6d is antihermitean. it is easy to nd the antiunitary operator that satises (3.6) in
this case. it is given by q = i2k where i2  c is the charge conjugation operator satisfying
c 1 =  and k denotes complex conjugation. we see that like in the 4d case outlined
c
above, q2 = 1 and the majorana condition

 = ck

(4.13)

makes sense only if we introduce conjugation of the second kind,  = . the majorana
condition is then consistent with the explicit form

 =   

 !

(4.14)

of the spinors. the generators of the euclidean lorentz-group corresponding to the representation
(8.56) of  are given by [19]

s =

i
4

[, ]

(4.15)

we nd s01 = 2/2, s02 = 1/2 and s12 = 3/2. these are equivalent to the generators
of the rotation group and one can easily verify that the corresponding lorentz-transformations
commute with the anti-unitary operator q dening the majorana condition in our case.

to write down the fermionic action we now look for an operator o such that det o = 1 and
t o =  = (q). we immediately arrive at

o = i2

(4.16)

in addition, oi6d is antisymmetric so it is now straightforward to write down a partition function
for majorana fermions satisfying (4.13) in 3d euclidean space

qdet(i 6d) = qdet(oi 6d) = z d eto i 6d

(4.17)

5 the dirac operator for majorana fermions

in analogy with 4d, we expect that there is a basis in which i6d can be written in the form of real
quaternions [5]. we will now verify this. it is easily checked (using c 2 = 1, 
k = k and

k = + k) that an expansion of  consistent with the majorana condition is

 = xk (cid:16) kk + c 

k

k(cid:17)

(5.18)

where k are arbitrary c-number 2-spinors and k are grassmann variables. since (ck)2 = 1,
k and c 

k are linearly independent.

we then see that the expression in the fermionic action involving the dirac operator can be
written

this can be veried using the properties of c and eq. (3.6) from which we derive

qkl = a0

where a0

6 random matrix theory

we are now ready to dene the random matrix theory for massive, parity-invariant three-
dimensional qcd with fermions in the adjoint representation.
in analogy with all the other

8

cases in 3d [7, 9] and in 4d [3, 4, 5, 10], we substitute the integral over gauge eld congurations
in the partition function for qcd with an integral over a hermitian random matrix t . we take
this matrix to have the quaternion structure (5.20). using the same notation as in [5] we therefore
set

tij =

a
iji

3

x=0

(6.24)

where a
ij are real numbers and we have dened 0 = i and 1, 2, 3 are the usual pauli
matrices. this means the matrix elements of t are themselves 2  2 matrices. the operator 6d is
antihermitian, so we can substitute 6d in the euclidean fermion determinant with the matrix it
where t is hermitian:

z(m1, ..., m2nf ) = z da es[a]

2nf

yf =1qdet(6d + mf )

2nf

 z dt en 2tr(t t )

yf =1qdet(it + mf )

(6.25)

this random matrix theory has the same global avor symmetry as the qcd partition function.
in addition, t is here taken to be a matrix of n  n real quaternions, so that the anti-unitary
symmetry of adjoint qcd is reproduced, and as we will see, the avor symmetry breaking pattern
will appear from the random matrix partition function. dt is the invariant (haar) measure. as
usual [3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10] n is identied with the space-time volume. we will see that  is the value
of the condensate (the order parameter for spontaneous symmetry breaking) dened by

 =  lim
mf 0

lim
n

1
n



mf

lnz(m1, ..., m2nf )

(6.26)

we are assuming that this condensate is non-zero. as discussed in section 2, we choose the masses
in pairs of opposite sign, so that the corresponding minkowski space theory is parity-invariant.
we call the total number of avors 2nf , and we choose mf = +m for f = 1, ..., nf and mf = m
for f = nf + 1, ..., 2nf , where m is a real positive number.

in order to evaluate the partition function (6.25) we rewrite the square root of the fermion
determinant as an integral over grassmann variables (cf. (5.19)):

(t  imf )ijj


(6.27)

where the indices i, j are summed over from 1 to n . here we are using the formalism developed
in [16] for supersymmetric matrix integrals. our matrix integral is pure fermionic and involves
no bosonic variables, so we will apply this formalism using only the fermion-fermion block. our
integration measure is

with s a symmetric real matrix and ds the haar measure. in the next section we will evaluate
this expression using a saddle point analysis to nd the low-energy eective partition function
for three-dimensional qcd with adjoint fermions.

we now decompose the real symmetric matrix s in (6.41) into polar coordinates [20]:

(7.45)

where [o] denotes the set of left cosets of the group of 2nf  2nf real orthogonal matrices with

and j() is the jacobian corresponding to (7.42). this jacobian was given in [20] and is propor-

(7.47)

we are now ready to determine the saddle point of the partition function at zero mass. setting

since the jacobian drops out in the large n limit. it follows from the derivation of the banks-

we now expand the determinant in (6.41) at the saddle point,  = sp for a small mass matrix

(7.51)

the matrix j was dened in (7.50). this is our expression for the low-energy eective partition
function. as usual, it is a function of the scaling variable n m. the matrix j is invariant under
the subgroup o(nf )  o(nf ), so in our nal expression for z(m),

14

z(m)  zo(2nf )/(o(nf )o(nf ))

(7.52)

the integral goes over the coset space o(2nf )/(o(nf )  o(nf )). the avor symmetry breaking

8 sum rules

we can easily derive the rst leutwyler-smilga like sum rule for the eigenvalues of the dirac
operator. we will use the same method as in [5, 9].

the sum rules are obtained by expanding the expression for z(m), eq. (7.52) and comparing the
coecients order by order in m2 to the (normalized) expectation value of the fermion determinant:

*yf yk>0 1 +

m2

k !+

(8.55)

(note that because of our choice of (p, z2)-invariant lagrangian, there is an eective chiral
symmetry that makes the spectrum symmetric around  = 0. this chiral symmetry applies to
the 4  4 gamma matrices given in eq. (2.4) of ref. [9]:

0 =   3

0 3 ! ,

or equivalently to the corresponding euclidean gamma matrices. we could just as well write l
in terms of these.) here the expectation value is dened as

hf (, m)i = r da es[a] (qk,f k
r da es[a] (qk,f k

f

(8.57)

where a is the gauge eld and s[a] the euclidean yang-mills action. expanding the integrand
in (7.52) the surviving group integrals at order m2 have the form

(x) = zog/h

do tr(ojot x)tr(ojot x)  zog/h

do tr2(ojot x)

(8.58)

where g/h is the coset and x  n m  n mj. the rst order term is killed by the group
integration. we now choose real and symmetric generators tk, k = 1, ..., m for the coset. m is
the dimension of the coset given in (7.54). we also choose a normalization for the generators:

tr(tktl) = 2nf kl

(8.59)

this normalization is natural since the generators are 2nf  2nf matrices. we wish to choose
t1 such that t1 = j. in doing this we can use the relation

m

xk=1

tr(atk)tr(btk) = 2nf tr(ab)

(8.60)

to calculate the value of (x). because of the invariance of the measure in the integral dening
(x), one nds that (x) is proportional to tr(x x). due to eq (8.59) and the choice of t1, we
nd (t1) = (t2) = ... = (tm ). therefore we can set

(t1) =

1
m

m

xk=1z do tr2(ojot tk)

using (8.60) and tr(j 2) = 2nf we now immediately see that

(x) =

m

vol(g/h)(n m)2(2nf )2

(8.61)

inserting this into the expansion we get

(8.63)

where the volume of the coset cancels in the ratio. inserting the value of m we therefore arrive
at the sum rule

* xk>0

(n k)2+ =

(2nf )2
2  2nf m

=

2
2nf

(8.64)

where 2nf is the original number of avors. accidentally, it is numerically the same as for the
case  = 1 in 3d [9]. it agrees with the general formula found in [9],

yf * xk>0

1

(n k)2+ =

d2
2m

(8.65)

which applies to all the 3d cases [7, 9], if one performs the group integrals over the corresponding
cosets. (note that in [7] the sum rule for the 3d case  = 2 was given for su (nf ) and not for
the coset.) here d is the size of the matrices of the coset, and the two factors of d come from
the normalization of the generators (8.59) and from tr(j 2). the corresponding formula for the
4d cases was given in [4, 5]. a common feature of all the 3d cases  = 1, 2, 4 is that the trace
appearing in (8.58) is real. this adds a factor of two to the sum rules with respect to the 4d
cases.

9 conclusion

we have obtained the mass dependence of the nite volume partition function for three-dimensional
qcd with quarks in the adjoint representation and gauge group su (nc) (nc  2). we chose the
quark masses such that the corresponding minkowski space qcd lagrangian is (p, z2)invariant,
where p denotes the parity transformation dened in three dimensions by eq. (2.3).

as a starting point we used a random matrix theory with the same global symmetries as the gauge
theory. this is possible since the gauge theory and the random matrix theory are equivalent in
the mesoscopic regime.

the eective partition function describes the static limit of the goldstone modes resulting from
the spontaneous breaking of global avor symmetry. it is determined by the symmetry breaking
pattern. we assumed that avor symmetry breaking occurs, and found that the global avor
symmetry o(2nf ) is broken by the vacuum state to o(nf )  o(nf ) symmetry.

although the author does not claim to understand the classication of symmetric superspaces,
it is interesting to note that the result obtained here for the goldstone manifold, together with
the other goldstone manifolds obtained for  = 1, 2, and 4 in 3d and 4d, exhaust the scheme of
zirnbauer [21] with respect to the fermionic symmetric spaces mf . (i thank poul damgaard and
jac verbaarschot for this remark.) we can see this by looking at table 3 of [21] and matching the
various random matrix ensembles with the fermionic symmetric spaces given by zirnbauer. these
spaces, together with the corresponding bosonic symmetric spaces mb, make up the riemannian
symmetric superspaces corresponding to the various supersymmetric generating functions.
in
simple terms, each symmetric superspace corresponds to a random matrix theory. for us the
mf dene the respective goldstone manifolds, since we do not have any bosonic sector. from
the fermionic symmetric spaces given by zirnbauer [21] we conrm that our case, the gaussian
symplectic ensemble, corresponds to the random matrix theory denoted aii in table 3 of [21],
while the coset spaces obtained in [5, 7, 9] nicely t the compact symmetric spaces belonging to
the classes labelled by a, ai, aiii, bdi, and cii. the classes a, ai, and aii correspond to the
non-chiral ensembles while aiii, bdi, and cii correspond to the chiral ones.
