abstract

using the adhm instanton calculus, we evaluate the one-instanton contribution to the low-
energy eective prepotential of n = 2 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills theory with nf
avors of hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and a hypermultiplet in the
symmetric rank two tensor representation. for nf < n  2, when the theory is asymptoti-
cally free, our result is compared with the exact solution that was obtained using m-theory

and we nd complete agreement.

an important development in the study of four-dimensional yang-mills theory has been
the prediction of exact results for models with n = 2 supersymmetry. the pioneering work
was that of seiberg and witten, who investigated the pure su(2) yang-mills theory [1] and

also su(2) models with matter transforming in the fundamental or the adjoint representa-

tion [2]. subsequently, their results have been generalized to a wide range of models with

simple or direct product gauge group and matter in various representations.

the general prescription for the exact results involves an algebraic curve, whose form

depends on the model being considered, and a particular one-form dened on the curve.

the one-form is to be integrated over one-cycles that form a canonical basis on the curve.

this yields an exact solution for the eective prepotential, the holomorphic function that

describes the low-energy coulomb branch physics.

a general property of the eective prepotential is that at weak-coupling it has an expan-

sion consisting of a one-loop perturbative term plus an innite series of non-perturbative

terms that correspond to instanton eects. in principle, it is possible to directly calculate

these eects from rst principles in the weakly-coupled quantum eld theory. this is an

important exercise, since by comparing the results of rst-principles instanton calculations

with the predictions extracted from the curves one can directly test the exact results and the

means by which they have been derived. over the last few years there has arisen a program

of research concerned with carrying out precisely such tests of the exact results [310].

in this letter, we continue this program of instanton tests. we focus on a model which

has gauge group su(n) and nf avors of hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation

as well as a hypermultiplet transforming in the symmetric rank two tensor representation.
in other words, we investigate n = 2 supersymmetric qcd (n = 2 sqcd) coupled to
a symmetric tensor hypermultiplet. the algebraic curve corresponding to this model was

derived by landsteiner, lopez and lowe by studying brane congurations in m-theory [11].

the one-instanton contribution to the eective prepotential predicted by the curve has

been explicitly determined by ennes et al. [12]. to test the curve, we calculate the same

contribution from rst principles. our result completely agrees with the curve prediction

1

thus verifying the exact solution and the m-theory method at the one-instanton level.2

to perform the instanton calculation, we employ the instanton calculus, based on the

construction of atiyah, drinfeld, hitchin and manin (adhm) [14], that has been developed

in [4, 5, 15, 10]. whilst this calculus is important mainly for the study of multi-instanton

eects, it is useful in the present context because it greatly facilitates the collective coor-

dinate integration at the heart of the instanton calculation. (in particular, it simplies an

otherwise highly non-trivial integration over the group space collective coordinates of the

instanton.)

to begin, we will briey summarize the essential features of the adhm instanton calculus
for the specic case of n = 2 sqcd [5, 15, 10], borrowing from the results of ref. [10] in
particular. we will subsequently describe how this calculus is extended when n = 2 sqcd
is coupled to a symmetric tensor hypermultiplet. we specialize to the one-instanton case

throughout, this being sucient for our purpose.

in n = 2 sqcd, the supersymmetric adhm one-instanton background is parameterized
i) an (n + 2)  2 complex-valued matrix a (and its conjugate a), associated with
by:
the gauge eld, ii) a pair of (n + 2)-dimensional grassmann-valued vectors {m,n} (and
the conjugate pair { m, n}), associated with the two adjoint weyl fermions, and iii) nf
pairs of grassmann parameters {kf , kf} (f = 1, . . . , nf ), associated with the nf avors
of fundamental and conjugate-fundamental weyl fermions. whereas kf and kf are free
parameters, the collective coordinates associated with the adjoint elds, a, m and n , are
required to satisfy certain constraint equations. to write these equations, it is rst useful
to decompose a, m and n (and their conjugates) as follows:
 =(cid:0) w 
m =(cid:0)u

u a (cid:1) ,
m (cid:1) ,

a  =

m =


2our attention is restricted to nf < n  2, when the theory is asymptotically free; we are unable to
provide a test in the vanishing -function case nf = n 2 since here the curve of [11] has not been explicitly
parameterized. instanton tests of the exact results for n = 2 sqcd have revealed important discrepancies
in the vanishing -function case that  at least for n > 3  have yet to be completely resolved [5, 13, 10].

besides these collective coordinates, the adhm one-instanton background in n = 2
sqcd is further described by a parameter atot associated with the adjoint scalar eld a.
on the coulomb branch, this eld satises

hai = diag(v1, v2, . . . , vn ),

(6)

where the vu are arbitrary complex numbers that sum to zero. the parameter atot is deter-
mined in terms of these vacuum expectation values (vevs) and the collective coordinates
a, m and n by the following equation:

the adhm instanton calculus provides expressions for both the action and the collec-

tive coordinate integration measure corresponding to the supersymmetric adhm instanton

background. in terms of the above quantities, the one-instanton action for n = 2 sqcd is
given by [5, 10]

(11)

this fermion bilinear is associated with the conjugate adjoint scalar eld a in the same way

that f is associated with a; it reects a yukawa source term involving the fundamental

fermions in the euler-lagrange equation for this eld [5, 10].

the one-instanton collective coordinate integration measure for n = 2 sqcd takes
the form of a at measure with respect to the parameters {a,m,n ,atot,k, k}, with the
constraint equations (3), (5) and (7) imposed by means of -functions under the integral

the constant prefactor c 

1 can be determined by comparing with the standard t hooft-
bernard one-instanton measure [16, 17]. thus, in the pauli-villars regularization scheme,
one nds c 

1 = 222n m 2n nf , where m is the regularization mass.

having summarized the adhm instanton calculus for n = 2 sqcd, we now describe
its extension when this theory is coupled to a symmetric tensor hypermultiplet. the super-

symmetric instanton background for the resulting theory will include congurations corre-

sponding to the component elds of the extra hypermultiplet. the relevant fermionic eld

4

congurations are given by the zero-mode solutions to the massless dirac equation in

the symmetric tensor or conjugate-symmetric tensor representation. at the one-instanton

level, these solutions are parameterized by a pair of (n + 2)-dimensional grassmann-valued
vectors, r and r [18]; these can be decomposed as

r =


u

r




 ,

r =(cid:16)u r(cid:17) .

(13)

a useful simplication is that there are no constraints on these collective coordinates [18];
the number of parameters in each of r and r precisely equals the number of zero-modes of
the dirac operator in the symmetric tensor representation.3

we can directly associate a collective coordinate integration measure with the extra
fermion zero-modes. since r and r are free parameters, it is simply the (suitably normal-
ized) at measure

z d1-i

hyp =

m (n +2)

22n 2(n +2) z dn  dn  d2r d2 r.

(14)

the full one-instanton integration measure for the theory is now given by the product of
this and the full n = 2 sqcd measure (12).

the one-instanton action for the theory is straightforward to determine using the meth-
ods of [4, 5, 10]. it is the sum of the n = 2 sqcd action (10) and the hypermultiplet-induced
contribution

s 1-i

hyp = 422 uvuu  82

hypatot + 2m2(2uu + rr
),

where m is the bare mass of the symmetric tensor hypermultiplet and


hyp = 

i
2

rr.

(15)

(16)

the origin of this fermion bilinear is similar to that of hyp; it reects a yukawa source term

involving the symmetric tensor fermions that appears in the euler-lagrange equation for
a.

3this is true only at the one-instanton level; at higher order instanton levels the collective coordinate
matrices that parameterize the symmetric tensor fermion zero-mode solutions must indeed satisfy constraint
equations [18].

5

in terms of the instanton action and collective coordinate integration measure, one can

derive the following expression for the one-instanton contribution to the eective prepoten-

tial of the theory [19]:

f1 = 8iz d1-i

sqcd d1-i

hyp exp((s 1-i

sqcd + s 1-i

hyp)).

(17)

here r d1-i
sqcd is a reduced version of the full n = 2 sqcd measure, which excludes the
integration over the global position of the instanton in n = 2 superspace, as represented by
(x0, 1, 2) = (a,m/4,n /4). our task is now to explicitly evaluate this integral expression.
to do this, we will follow closely the one-instanton calculation for n = 2 sqcd performed
in sec. 8 of ref. [10].

sqcd by
introducing a set of auxiliary (lagrange multiplier) integration variables. thus, for the

the rst step is to exponentiate the -function constraints in the measure r d1-i

spin-1 constraints on a, we write

uwu (cid:17) =

uwu (cid:17) ,

(18)

where the pc are a triplet of standard bosonic lagrange multipliers, and for the spin-1/2
constraints on m and n , we write

y=1,2
y=1,2

 (uwu  + w uu) = 2z d2 exp(cid:0) (uwu  + w uu)(cid:1) ,
 (uwu  + w uu) = 2z d2 exp(cid:0) (uwu  + w uu)(cid:1) ,

(19)

where the grassmann spinors   and   serve as fermionic lagrange multipliers. the
exponentiation of the spin-0 -function constraint on atot is accomplished in a more
subtle way involving the atot-dependent terms in the instanton action. we write

hyp)atot(cid:1)

hyp)z  z( + f ))(cid:1) , (20)

6

where we have introduced a complex auxiliary integration variable z.

after the exponentiation of the -function constraints, the next step is to integrate over
the collective coordinates {w, , ,k, k,r, r}. this is a fairly straightforward procedure
since all the relevant integrals are gaussian; the result is

yu=1(cid:16)m + 2iz 

2vu(cid:17)#(cid:16)m + 22iz(cid:17)2

.

(22)

it remains to integrate over the auxiliary integration variables {p, , , z}. since the
hypermultiplet-induced factor f (z) has no dependence on p,  or , the integration over

these variables is exactly as described in sec. 8 of ref. [10]. thus we arrive at the expression

f1 =

then working out the residues of the various poles. the result is

(here we have introduced the dynamical scale p v , dened by b0
p v = m b0 exp(82/g2),
where b0 = n  2  nf is the rst -function coecient.) as in [10], we evaluate this nal
integral by rewriting the operator (pu /vu)2 as 2/ z2 acting inside the integral and

now we compare our rst-principles result with the exact solution derived in [11]. the

prediction for f1 extracted from this solution is [12]4

(25)

whilst this is not identical to the expression (24) for general nf , it is equivalent to that
expression for nf < n  2, which is the range of validity of the curve presented in [11]. one
can show this by checking that the singularity structure of the two expressions is the same
at the points vu  vv = 0. hence the dierence between the two expressions must be given
by a regular function of the vevs; by dimensional analysis, this function must be zero for
nf < n  4, equal to a numerical constant in the case nf = n  4, and given by a linear
combination of the masses, am + bpf mf , where a and b are numerical constants, in the
case nf = n  3. (in this last case, there can be no linear dependence on the vevs since
pu vu  0.) since information about the low-energy physics is obtained by dierentiating
the prepotential at least once with respect to the vevs, it follows that the two expressions
are indeed physically equivalent for nf < n  2. thus our rst-principles one-instanton
calculation has provided a successful test of the exact solution and the m-theory method

that was used to derive it.

it would be desirable to perform instanton tests of the exact results for su(n) models

with matter hypermultiplets in other representations such as the antisymmetric and the

adjoint. the instanton calculation is more of a challenge here since the collective coordinates

associated with the hypermultiplets are not unconstrained (even at the one-instanton level)

4we have accounted for a factor of 2 dierence in the denition of the prepotential in [12] and a factor of

2 dierence in the denition of the hypermultiplet masses. we have also eliminated the dynamical scale

b0 appearing in [12] in favor of b0
from renormalization group matching arguments [3].

p v by means of the relation b0 = (1)nf 2b0/2+2b0

p v , which follows

8

and one must introduce extra lagrange multipliers to deal with the extra -functions in the

integration measure. we aim to address this challenge elsewhere.
