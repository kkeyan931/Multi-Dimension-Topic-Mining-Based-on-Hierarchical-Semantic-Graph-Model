abstract

we study the role of higher derivative terms (riemann curvature squared
ones) in thermodynamics of scfts via ads/cft correspondence. using
iib string eective action (d5 ads gravity) with such hd terms deduced
from heterotic string via duality we calculate strong coupling limit of n = 2
scft free energy with the account of next to leading term in large n ex-
pansion. it is compared with perturbative result following from boundary
qft. considering modication of such action where hd terms form weyl
squared tensor we found (strong coupling limit) free energy in such theory.
it is interesting that leading and next to leading term of large n expanded
free energy may dier only by factor 3/4 if compare with perturbative result.
considering hd gravity as bosonic sector of some (compactied) hd super-
gravity we suggest new version of ads/cft conjecture and successfully test
it on the level of free energies for n = 2, 4 scfts.

1. ads/cft correspondence [1] (for an excellent review, see [2]) may provide
new insights to strong coupling regions of susy qfts. one example of this
sort is given by strong coupling limit of n = 4 super ym theory free energy
[3, 4] which diers by factor 3/4 with perturbative result (boundary qft)
in the leading order of 1/n expansion3. it is quite interesting to understand
what happens in the next order of 1/n expansion. clearly that such analysis
should be related with higher derivatives (hd) terms on sg side. in more
general framework hd terms may help in better understanding of ads/cft
correspondence or even in formulation of new versions of bulk/boundary
conjecture.

that is the purpose of present work to study the role of hd terms in bulk
action in ads/cft correspondence. in the next two sections we nd strong
coupling limit of n = 2 scft free energy and compare it with perturbative
result up to the terms of next to leading order. hd terms are chosen in
riemann curvature squared form or in weyl tensor squared form. the metric
of eective ve-dimensional gravity is bh in ads background. in the last
section we suggest new hd ads/cft conjecture. we show that it works well
on the level of comparison of free energies for scfts (or trace anomalies) if
bulk sector is described by some hd (super)gravity.
2.the trace anomaly of d = 4, n = 2 and n = 4 scfts (bulk side cal-
culation) has been found up to next to leading order in the 1/n expansion
in refs.
[7, 8]. even in next to leading order term it coincides with qft
result (for gravity side derivation of trace anomaly, mainly in n = 4 super
ym case, see also refs.[9, 10]). the n = 2 theory with the gauge group
sp(n) arises as the low-energy theory on the world volume on n d3-branes
sitting inside 8 d7-branes at an o7-plane [11]. the string theory dual to
this theory has been conjectured to be type iib string theory on ads5  x 5
where x5 = s5/z2 [12], whose low energy eective action is given by4 (see
3thermodynamics of n = 4 super ym theory in relation with ads/cft correspon-

(1)

the overall factor of the action is dierent by 1
2 from that of the action which
corresponds to n = 4 su(n) gauge theory. the latter action is given by
type iib (compactied) string theory on ads5  s5. the factor 1
2 comes
from the fact that the volume of x 5 = s5/z2 is half of s5 due to z2. note
that riemann curvature squared term in the above bulk action is deduced
from heterotic string via heterotic-type i duality [13] (dilaton is assumed to
be constant).

we now consider the thermodynamical quantities like free energy. after
wick-rotating the time variables by t  i , the free energy f can be obtained
from the action s in (1) where the classical solution is substituted:

here v3 is the volume of 3d at space and we assume  has a period of 1

the expression of s contains the divergence coming from large r. in order
to subtract the divergence, we regularize s in (9) by cutting o the integral
at a large radius rmax and subtracting the solution with  = 0:

(12)

we now compare the above results with those of eld theory of n = 2
sp(n) gauge theory. n = 2 theory contains nv = 2n 2 + n vector mul-
tiplet and nh = 2n 2 + 7n  1 hypermultiplet [7]. vector multiplet con-
sists of two weyl fermions, one complex scalar and one real vector what
gives 4 bosonic (fermionic) degrees of freedom on shell and hypermultiplet
contains two complex scalars and two weyl fermions, what also gives 4
bosonic (fermionic) degrees of freedom on shell [14]. therefore there ap-

pear 4  (nv + nh ) = 16(cid:16)n 2 + 2n  1

4(cid:17) boson-fermion pairs. in the limit

which we consider, the interaction between the particles can be neglected.
the contribution to the free energy from one boson-fermion pair in the space
with the volume v3 can be easily estimated [3, 4]. each pair gives a contri-
bution to the free energy of 2v3t 4
. therefore the total free energy f should
be

f =

n

4n 2(cid:19) .

(13)

comparing (13) with (11), there is the dierence of factor 4
order of 1/n as observed in [3, 4].

3 in the leading

hence, we calculated strong coupling limit of free energy in n = 2 scft
from sg side up to next to leading order term (it was generated by riemann
curvature squared term). its weak coupling limit (13) obtained from qft
side cannot be presented as strong coupling limit free energy multiplied to
some constant. this only holds for leading order terms where mismatch
multiplier is 3/4. the next to leading term in (13) should be multiplied to
9/32 in order to produce the corresponding term in (11). we have to pay
attention once more that the main role in whole above analysis was played
by riemann curvature squared term. in the section 4 we try to understand
the role of hd terms in ads/cft correspondence from the dierent point
of view.
3. we now consider the case where the action is given by the sum of einstein

5

term and the square of the weyl tensor cc  5

s = z d5xg(cid:26) 1

2 r   + ccc (cid:27) .

(14)

in ve dimensions, the square of the weyl tensor is given by

cc  =

r2

(15)

the weyl tensor term does not contribute to the radius l of ads5. by using
the equation of motion, we nd

by using (16), we can delete r in (14) and obtain

since the square of the weyl tensor is given by

the case with r2 combination as c 2 does not make modication of original ads5  s5

remarkably the above result coincides with that of the simplied procedure,
where the correction is evaluated by substituting the leading solution into
the correction term, the square of the weyl tensor, in the action (14):

(23)

therefore we obtain the following thermodynamical quantities;

(24)

choosing  and  as in (3), above action may be considered as another
modication of string action of the same sort as (1). with it we obtain

(25)

therefore if we further choose c by

c =

n

9  42 ,

the strong coupling limit free energy in (13) can be reproduced including the
next-to-leading order term with the common overall factor 3
4 .
4. instead of (1), we can consider more general action of r2 gravity:

s = z d5xg(cid:26)ar2 + brr + crr +

1

2 r  (cid:27) .

(27)

one can imagine that this is bosonic sector of some hd multidimensional
(probably compactied to ads) sg. it was already shown [8] that such bulk
theory may correctly reproduce trace anomaly of n = 4 super ym theory.
we wish further check such hd ads/cft conjecture on the level of free
energies. note that such theory may represent (yet unknown) resummation
of string eective action or it may directly follow from strings or m-theory.
it is known, for example, that hd quantum gravity has better uv properties
than usual einstein gravity (see [15] for a review).

if c = 0, the equations of motion given by (27) can be solved exactly.
and as shown in [8], the anomaly of n = 4 super yang-mills theory can
be reproduced in case of c = 0. in the following, we consider only special
case:c = 0.

when c = 0, we can assume that the solution has the form:

ds2 = gdxdx = e2dt2+e2dr2+r2

3

xi=1(cid:16)dxi(cid:17)2

in this case, the curvature tensors become

, e2 =

1

r2   +

r4

l2! .

(26)

(28)

(29)

r = 

20
l2 , r = 

4
l2 g ,

which tell that these curvatures are covariantly constant. then in the equa-
tions of motion following from the action (27), the terms containing the
covariant derivatives of the curvatures vanish and the equations have the
following forms:

0 = 

1
2

g(cid:26)ar2 + brr +

1

2 r  (cid:27) + 2arr + 2brr

 +

1
2 r .
(30)

8

then substituting eqs.(29) into (30), we nd

12
2l2   .
the equation (31) can be solved with respect to l2 if

80a
l4 +

16b
l4 

0 =

144
4  16{20a + 4b}   0

which can been found from the determinant in (31). then we obtain

(31)

(32)

l2 = 

12

2 q 144

4  16{20a + 4b} 

2

.

(33)

the sign in front of the root in the above equation may be chosen to be
positive, which corresponds to the einstein gravity (a = b = 0). with l in
(33), the horizon radius rh and the temperature t are given by

(35)

here we delete  by using (33). note that we may also consider special case
of no einstein term in above equations since the above expressions are not
perturbative but exact when c = 0.

we can consider the case of n = 4 super yang-mills theory. when
the gauge group is u(n), there are 8n 2 set of the bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom on-shell and when su(n), 8(n 2  1) since one multiplet
corresponds to nv = nh = 1 in n = 2 theory and contains 8 boson (fermion)
degrees of freedom on shell. then from the perturbative qft its free energy
is given by,

f =

(36)

if we assume 2, , a, and b are given by the powers of n, we nd the above
free energy f can be reproduced if

10a + 2b = ( 0

(37)

as a special case, we can consider the theory without einstein term, i.e.,
1
2 = 0. then we nd l2 in (33) is given by

l2 = 2s 20a + 4b


.

(38)

since the  sign in (38) does not correspond to ads but to de sitter space,
we only consider the case of + sign. then the free energy f in (35) has the
following form:

f = v3q (20a + 4b) = 

4v3 (t )4 (10a + 2b)2



.

(39)

in the  sign in the rst line, + corresponds to negative  and  to positive
one since 20a+4b > 0 if  < 0 and 20a+4b < 0 if  > 0 from (32). therefore
we can obtain the free energy in (36) if

in the leading order of 1
5. in summary, we calculated strong coupling limit for free energy of n = 2
scft from ads/cft correspondence in the next to leading order of 1/n

n expansion, or u(n) case.

expansion. as bulk side we used ads einstein gravity with riemann curva-
ture (or weyl tensor) squared term. for general ve-dimensional hd gravity
considered as bosonic sector of some hd (probably compactied) sg we
formulated new hd ads/cft conjecture which works on the level of free
energies for n = 4 super ym. note also that it works for n = 2 scft.
indeed, in this case the analog of eqs.(37) is given by

notice nally that it would be really interesting to consider the role of above
hd terms to thermodynamics of ads/cft correspondence in the case of
non-constant dilaton. without hd terms the corresponding (approximate)
ads bh solution has been found in ref.[6].

it could be of interest also to investigate the role of spatial curvature to
above analysis. without hd terms such investigation has been presented in
refs.[16], which is much related to the study of nite gauge theories, including
n = 4 super ym theory in curved spacetime (qft side) where curvature
squared and scalar-gravitational divergences appear, see refs.[17].
