abstract

a longstanding puzzle concerns the calculation of the gluino condensate (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) = c3 in
n = 1 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory: so-called weak-coupling instanton (wci) cal-
culations give c = 1, whereas strong-coupling instanton (sci) calculations give, instead,
c = 2(cid:0)(n  1)!(3n  1)(cid:1)1/n . by examining correlators of this condensate in arbitrary multi-
instanton sectors, we cast serious doubt on the sci calculation of (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) by showing that an
a so-called kovner-shifman vacuum (in which (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) = 0) cannot straightforwardly resolve

essential stepnamely cluster decompositionis invalid. we also show that the addition of

this mismatch.

introduction

almost dating back to the development of qcd itself, supersymmetric versions of qcd

have been closely studied, as tractable laboratories for extracting exact analytic information

about both perturbative and non-perturbative phenomena in nonabelian gauge theories. one

outstanding puzzle, unresolved since the mid-1980s, concerns the calculation of the gluino

condensate(cid:10) tr2

symmetry breakdown.

162(cid:11) in these models. this is an interesting quantity, as it is a measure of chiral

in pure supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory, by dimensional

analysis, one expects

(cid:28) tr2
162(cid:29) = c3 ,

(1.1)

where  is the dynamical scale in the theory (developed by dimensional transmutation as in

qcd), while c is a numerical constant. remarkably, there are two approaches in the literature

for calculating (cid:10) tr2

in their predictions of the constant c. this disagreement is especially vexing in light of the

162(cid:11), each purporting to be exact (i.e., nonrenormalized), but which dier

fact that both involve the use of supersymmetric instantons. the rst approach, generally

known as strong-coupling instanton (sci) calculations, was developed in refs. [14], while

the second approach, generally known as weak-coupling instanton (wci) calculations, was

developed in refs. [58]; for self-containedness, both will be reviewed below.

in this paper, we re-examine this old controversy, using our recently developed methods

for studying supersymmetric multi-instantons [912].

in particular, by looking at n-point

correlators (cid:10) tr2(x1)

topological numbers k. in a nutshell, our results cast serious doubt on the validity of the sci

162 (cid:11) of the gluino condensate, we will be able to probe arbitrary

162

   tr2(xn)

calculations of the condensate. specically, we will demonstrate that an essential technical

step in the sci approach, namely the use of cluster decomposition, is invalid.

in addition, we will address an ingenious, if controversial,1 hypothesis of shifmans, in
which the numerical disagreement between the sci and wci results is taken as circumstantial

evidence for the existence of an extra disconnected vacuum in sym theory in which chiral

symmetry is unbroken [15, 16]. while this so-called kovner-shifman (ks) vacuum can

indeed potentially resolve the disagreement at the 1-instanton sector (k = 1), we will show

that it fails to do so for the topological sectors with k > 1. this discouraging nding might

be viewed as removing some of the impetus for positing such a vacuum in the rst place.

finally we will present a novel calculation of(cid:10) tr2(x)

1see ref. [13] and the rebuttal ref. [14].

162 (cid:11) which relates the n = 1 supersym-

2

metric models discussed herein to the exactly soluble seiberg-witten models with n = 2
supersymmetry. this calculation is of potential pedagogical interest because it bypasses the

explicit use of instantons, and instead relies on functional methods. not surprisingly, it

recaptures the wci answer.

let us sketch in broad strokes the main dierences between the sci and wci calculations
(a more detailed review will follow). for n = 1 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory with
no matter, the leading coecient of the -function is b0 = 3n, so that 3 goes like an
n th root of an instanton: 3  exp(82/g2n). this means that a nave 1-instanton
calculation of (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) in which  is simply replaced by its classical value as an adjoint

fermion zero mode in the instanton background, and all the instanton collective coordinates,

both bosonic and fermionic, are integrated overfails; specically it gives a zero answer, due

to unsaturated grassmann integrations. in order to perform a sensible 1-instanton calculation

of(cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11), two alternative, and necessarily more elaborate, approaches suggest themselves. in
the sci approach, one calculates the n-point correlator of this condensate, which scales
like exp(82/g2), and is indeed nonzero at the 1-instanton level. furthermore, by a ward
identity reviewed in the appendix, it is independent of the n space-time insertion points xi.
after performing the requisite collective coordinate integration, one nds:

tr2(xn )

2n

162

  

162 (cid:29) =

(cid:28)tr2(x1)
in order to extract (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) from the correlator (1.2), one then invokes cluster decomposition:
taking |xixj|  1 where  is the mass gap in this theory, and remembering the constancy
162(cid:11)n . the net result
of the correlator, one replaces the left-hand side of eq. (1.2) simply by(cid:10) tr2

(n  1)! (3n  1)

thus reads:

3n .

(1.2)

(cid:28) tr2
162(cid:29) =

2

(cid:0)(n  1)! (3n  1)(cid:1)1/n 3 e2iu/n

(sci result) ,

(1.3)

where u = 0, . . . , n  1 indexes the n vacua |ui of the su(n) theory, and reects the
ambiguity in taking the n th root of unity. in retrospect (as argued in refs. [3,4]), the reason
why the nave calculation of (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) gives zero is that these n vacua are being averaged over

and the phases cancel.

in contrast, in the wci approach, one modies the pure gauge theory by adding matter

superelds in such a way that (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) itself (rather than a higher-point function thereof)
receives a nonzero contribution at the 1-instanton level. next, one decouples these extraneous
matter elds by giving them a mass m, and taking the joint limit m   and   0 in
the manner dictated by renormalization group (rg) decoupling. matching onto the eective

3

low-energy theory without matter gives:

(cid:28) tr2
162(cid:29) = 3

(wci result) .

(1.4)

note that the rg decoupling procedure forces the low-energy theory into one of the n
degenerate vacua |ui, which by convention we take to be the one with real phase. the
nomenclature strong coupling versus weak coupling used to designate these diering

approaches refers to the fact that, in the former, as in qcd, the only scale in the problem

is the dynamical scale , whereas in the latter, the existence of vevs vi of the matter
superelds permit a standard semiclassical expansion when the dimensionless ratios /vi are
all small.

as mentioned above, it is possible to reconcile the two calculations (1.3) and (1.4) by
positing the existence of an extra vacuum |si in which the condensate vanishes [15]. specif-
ically, if p and 1  p represent the probability weights in the vacuum sector of the theory for
the standard vacua {|ui}, and for |si, respectively, and if one takes

p =

2n

(n  1)! (3n  1)

,

(1.5)

then both the 1-instanton results can be understood. unfortunately, the multi-instanton cal-

culations presented below show that the mismatch between the sci and the wci calculations

becomes more severe for higher topological number k, and apparently cannot be reconciled

in this way for k > 1.

this paper is organized as follows. in secs. ii and iii, respectively, we review the sci

and wci calculations of (cid:10) tr2
162(cid:11) for general gauge group su(n). also in sec. iii we present
an alternate, non-instanton-based derivation of this condensate, specic to the gauge group
su(2), which starts from the seiberg-witten solution of the n = 2 model [17] and ows to
the n = 1 model, recapturing the wci result. in sec. iv we discuss cluster decomposition in
more depth, and motivate shifmans proposal for reconciling the sci and wci calculations

by postulating an extra vacuum state. our principal results are described in secs. v and

vi, in which (extending the sci approach) we calculate higher-point functions of the con-

densate, in the topological sectors k > 1. in sec. v we calculate, analytically, the (kn)-point

162 (cid:11) at the 2-instanton level for gauge group su(2). in either case

our calculations explicitly contradict the hypothesis of cluster decompositionboth with and
without an extra ks vacuum.2 concluding comments are made in sec. vii.

ii review of the strong-coupling instanton calcula-

tion

let us review the sci result for (cid:10)tr2(x1)   tr2(xn )(cid:11), for pure n = 1 su(n) gauge

theory. the calculation for done originally for the su(2) theory in [1] and then extended to

the su(n) theories in [3] (see also the very comprehensive review articles [4, 16]).

the correlator in question is saturated at the 1-instanton level. the gauge-invariant

collective coordinate integration measure is a suitable generalization of the bernard measure
[18] to an n = 1 theory, and reads:3



23n +2 2n 23n

(n  1)! (n  2)!z d4a d2 (2)2n 4 d2m d2 dn 2 dn 2 .

(2.1)

here a
n is (minus) the 4-position of the instanton and  is its scale size, the grassmann spinors
m
 and   parametrize the supersymmetric and superconformal modes, respectively, of the
gluino, and the grassmann parameters u and u, u = 1, . . . , n2, are the superpartners to
the iso-orientation modes which sweep the instanton through su(2) subgroups of the su(n)

gauge group (note that each u and u is a grassmann number rather than a grassmann
spinor). the measure includes the lambda parameter of the pauli-villars (pv) scheme which

at the two-loop level is [4]

 = g()2/3e82/(3n g()2) .

i=1 tr2(xi) where (x) is the most general classical adjoint
fermion zero mode in the 1-instanton background. in terms of these bosonic and fermionic

into this measure one inserts qn

2 sigma level, and incompatible with the modied clustering
result due to the incorporation of a ks vacuum (tuned to reconcile the wci and sci 1-instanton results),
at the 6 1

2 sigma level.

3our choice of notation is dictated by the k-instanton generalization of this measure, eq. (5.16) below.
following ref. [19], we correct a factor of two mistake in the normalization of adjoint fermion zero modes that
pervades much of the literature (e.g., refs. [4, 7]). hence our nal result for the n -point function, eq. (1.2),
diers by 2n from these references.

5

now let us carry out the grassmann integrations in eq. (2.1). obviously the  and
m grassmann integrations will be saturated from the condensates inserted at two points
{xi, xj} chosen from among the n insertions x1, . . . , xn . for each such pair there are three
contributions to these integrals:

(m2 at xi,  2 at xj) ,

(  m at xi,   m at xj) .

adding these three contributions gives the simpler expression

(2 + y2
i )4(2 + y2

j )4 .

(2.5a)

(2.5b)

(2.5c)

(2.6)

now we take advantage of the fact that this n-point function is independent of the xi (see
the appendix), to choose these insertion points for maximum simplicity of the algebra. the

simplest conceivable such choice, xi = 0 for all i, turns out to give an ill-dened answer of the
form 0   (the zero coming from the grassmann integrations as follows from eq. (2.6),
and the innity from divergences in the 2 integration due to coincident poles). in order to
sidestep this ambiguity, one chooses instead:

x1 =    = xn 1 = 0 ,

xn = x .

(2.7)

this choice is the simplest one which gives a well-dened answer with no 0 ambiguity.
more ambitiously, one can still perform the calculation even if all the insertion points are

taken to be arbitrary [3, 4]; however, we nd it convenient for later to take the minimal
resolution provided by (2.7). from the (xi  xj)2 dependence in eq. (2.6), it follows that
the pair of insertions {xi, xj} responsible for the {,m} integrations must include the point
xn = x; there are n  1 possible such pairs, giving

iii review of the weak-coupling instanton calcula-

tion

next, let us review the wci calculation of the gluino condensate. as mentioned above, the

general wci strategy is to extend the pure gauge theory to include matter content, in such

a way that (cid:10) tr2

extraneous matter and matching to the low-energy pure gauge theory is then accomplished

162(cid:11) receives a nonzero contribution at the 1-instanton level. decoupling the

using standard rg prescriptions. since the precise nature of this extraneous matter is rather

arbitrary, the wci calculation really stands for a family of related calculations sharing this

basic approach, all of which give the same result (1.4). calculations of this type were done

in [58] and reviewed in [16].

we will nd it ecient to exploit the functional identity (see for example [20]):

(cid:10)tr2(cid:11) = 8i(cid:28) 

 we(cid:29) =

162

b0 (cid:28)



we(cid:29) .

here we is the eective superpotential,

is the usual complexied coupling, and

 =

4i
g2 +


2

 =  e2i ()/b0

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

is the rg-invariant 1-loop dynamical scale of the theory. this result comes from writing the

microscopic gauge theory as

l =

1
4

im(cid:0)z d2 tr w w(cid:1) ,

7

(3.4)

where w  is the gauge eld-strength chiral supereld, and promoting  to a spurion super-
eld,

  t (y, ) =  (y) + 2 

(y) + 2f  (y) .

from eqs. (3.4)-(3.5) it trivially follows that

where

,

(cid:10)tr2(cid:11) =



8
z

f  (x) z(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t (y,)=
z = z dw eir d4x l

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

is the partition function of the microscopic theory, in the generalized background eld (3.5).

in order to derive eq. (3.1) from eq. (3.6), one assumes that the functional dierentiation

indicated in eq. (3.6) formally commutes with the integrating-out of the microscopic degrees
of freedom. in other words, z can be re-expressed in terms of the relevant eective chiral
superelds i (whatever these may be4):

where

,



8
ze

(cid:10)tr2(cid:11) =

f  (x) ze(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t (y,)=
ze = z di eir d4xr d2 we (i,t ) .

(3.8)

(3.9)

equation (3.1) then follows from the observation that we /f  = 2 we / .

we now need an explicit expression for the eective superpotential. following aeck,

dine and seiberg (ads) [5], it is convenient to start from su(n) gauge theory where the
number of avors nf is xed to nf = n  1. a 1-instanton calculation of the superpotential
then gives:

w nf ,n

e

 w n 1,n

e

= cads

,

(3.10)

b0

n 1,n

detnf(cid:0)qf qf (cid:1)

where the avor indices f, f  = 1, . . . , nf run over the quark superelds. the coecient of
the -function is, for general n and nf ,

4in the example culminating in eq. (3.16) below, we will nd that there are in fact no residual chiral
superelds i, so that simply we = we (t ), whereas in the seiberg-witten example (3.17) below, the i
are the monopole superelds m , m as well as the dual higgs ad.

b0 = 3n  nf .

(3.11)

8

the normalization constant for the specic case nf = n  1 was xed by an explicit 1-
instanton calculation, and is simply [19, 21] cads = 1. by decoupling the quark avors one
at a time, this 1-instanton expression ows into models with nf < n  1 for which the
superpotential is no longer a 1-instanton phenomenon. in this way one generalizes eq. (3.10)

to (see e.g., refs. [20, 22]):

ads = n  nf .

(3.13)

starting from this more general superpotential, let us decouple the remaining quarks, by

giving them a common vev v. viewing q as an nf  n matrix, one assumes:

the d-atness condition together with a global gauge rotation gives v = v. taking |v|  
then decouples the quarks as well as a subset of the gauge elds, leaving a pure su(n ) gauge
theory with n  = n  nf and b0 = 3n . the 1-loop rg matching prescription reads [19]:

|v| (cid:19)3n nf
(cid:18) nf ,n

= (cid:18)0,n 

|v| (cid:19)3n 

, n  = n  nf .

inputting eqs. (3.13)-(3.15) into eq. (3.12) gives:

we = (n  nf )   3n nf
|v|2nf !

nf ,n

n nf

= n (cid:0)0,n (cid:1)3 .

the desired result (1.4) then follows from eq. (3.1).

(3.15)

(3.16)

note that the starting-point for this wci calculation, eq. (3.10), is a bona de 1-instanton

calculation. the remaining steps towards the answer involve well-studied path-integral and

renormalization group manipulations (principally eq. (3.1), and eqs. (3.12)-(3.15), respec-

tively). alternatively, starting again from the functional identity (3.1), we can rederive the

wci result (1.4) without any reference to an instanton calculation. instead, one starts from

9

the seiberg-witten solution of the n = 2 model,5 in the presence of a mass deformation
which breaks the supersymmetry down to n = 1. in the strong-coupling domain, in the
vicinity of the monopole singularity, the superpotential looks like:

wsw = 2 m adm + m u(ad) .

(3.17)
here the chiral superelds {m, m} describe the monopole multiplet, ad is the dual higgs,
u is the quantum modulus of the theory (here, in strong coupling, expressed in terms of ad
rather than a), and m is the mass parameter. the f -atness condition for the vacuum reads

0 =

wsw
m

=

wsw
 m

=

wsw
ad

,

(3.18)

which is solved by

ad  hadi = 0 ,

in the vicinity of this solution, the relationship between ad and u =(cid:10)u(cid:11) is given by

from which it follows that

here the seiberg-witten dynamical scale sw is related to the conventional pv/dr scale
n =2 via [19]

sw = 2 n =2 .

(3.22)

note that the series (3.21) is not an instanton expansion (i.e., an expansion in 4

sw); instantons

than ad.

emerge only in the weak-coupling regime, where u is expanded in terms of a = (cid:10)a(cid:11) rather
applying the identity (3.1) to wsw using eqs. (3.21)-(3.22) gives the gluino condensate

in the vacuum (3.19):

(cid:10)tr2(cid:11) = 162m2

n =2 .

next we decouple the adjoint higgs supereld, by taking m  . in this way we ow to
the pure n = 1 supersymmetric su(2) gauge theory. the rg matching condition between
the scale  of the n = 1 theory and the scale n =2 of the mass-deformed n = 2 theory
reads [19]:

m24

n =2 = 6 .

(3.24)

substituting eq. (3.24) into eq. (3.23) once again gives the wci answer (1.4).

5for the remainder of the section, we focus on su (2) gauge theory, and quote well-known formulae from

seiberg and witten [17].

iv comments on cluster decomposition

in this section, we examine the issue of cluster decomposition in the context of the gluino

condensate. this issue of cluster decomposition is fundamental to a quantum eld theory.
the clustering property requires that for suciently large separations |xi  xj|, compared
with the inverse mass gap,6

h1(x1)   n(xn)i  h1i      hni .

(4.1)

generally, this property breaks down when, in a statistical mechanical sense, the theory is in

a mixed phase. in eld theory language, this means there is more than one possible vacuum

state. the clustering property is then restored by restricting the theory to the hilbert space

built on one of the vacua. in this sense, clustering is violated in a mild way, and to distinguish

this from some other, potentially more serious, violations uncovered below, we will say that

the theory satises a generalized notion of clustering.

let us consider the calculation of the gn, the n-point function of the composite operator

trn 2 :

gn(x1, . . . , xn) = htrn 2(x1)   trn 2(xn)i .

(4.2)

for present purposes we restrict our attention to pure n = 1 su(n) gauge theory. since
trn 2 is the lowest component of a gauge-invariant chiral supereld (namely trn w 2 where
w  is the eld-strength supereld), a well-known identityreviewed in the appendixsays
that

gn(x1, . . . , xn) = const. ,

(4.3)

independent of the xi. next let us consider this constant correlator in the instanton ap-
proximation. this means that, at topological level k, (x) is simply to be replaced by a

general superposition of adjoint fermion zero modes in the general adhm k-instanton back-

ground, weighted by grassmann-valued parameters (i.e., fermionic collective coordinates).

all bosonic and fermionic collective coordinates are then integrated over, in the appropriate
supersymmetric way reviewed below. it can also be shown that gn should still be a constant.
(the eld theory proof of the constancy of the correlation functions and its extension to the

instanton approximation is discussed in the appendix.) now, in su(n) gauge theory, at the

topological level k, a multi-instanton has precisely 2kn adjoint fermion zero modes which

need to be integrated over. let us summarize the rules for grassmann integration: if  is a

grassmann parameter, then

z d  = 1 ,

z d 1 = 0 .

(4.4)

since trn 2 is a grassmann bilinear, it follows that gn is only non-vanishing for n = kn.
in particular, the one-point function g1 always vanishes.
in summary, in the instanton
approximation, at topological level k, we have the following selection rule:

= 0

htrn 2(x)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k-inst  g1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k-inst
htrn 2(x1)   trn 2(xn)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k-inst  gn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)k-inst

for all k ;

6= 0 if and only if n = kn .

(4.5a)

(4.5b)

notice that these results already indicate a breakdown of clustering for the correlation func-

tions (4.2), although, as we shall explain below the breakdown is of the mild variety and can

be traced to the fact that in instanton approximation the theory is in a mixed phase, i.e. the

instanton approximation samples the theory in a number of distinct vacua as opposed to a

single vacuum.

a general eld-theoretic understanding of the selection rule (4.5a)-(4.5b) was suggested
in refs. [3, 4]. the suggestion relies on the fact that, in n = 1 su(n) gauge theory, the
vacua of the theory come in an n-tuplet [24]. the vacua spontaneously break the discrete
z2n anomaly-free remnant of the classical u(1)r symmetry to the z2 subgroup:   .
the vacuum sector therefore consists of:

if we dene the condensate j via

0  u  n  1 (cid:9) .
(cid:8) |ui :
j = hu = 0| trn 2 |u = 0i ,

then the n-tuple of vacua are related by phase factors, namely the n th roots of unity:

hu| trn 2 |ui = j e2iu/n .

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

now let us see how the selection rule (4.5a) comes about. we dene the density matrix

 =

1
n

n 1

xu=0

|uihu| .

(4.9)

since the instanton calculation is z2n symmetric, it must average over all the vacua. this
means

(cid:10)trn 2(cid:11) = tr(cid:0) trn 2(cid:1) =

1
n

n 1

xu=0

hu| trn 2 |ui = j

n

n 1

xu=0

e2iu/n = 0 .

(4.10)

12

here the capitalized tr means a trace over the hilbert space. in order to check the selection

rule (4.5b), we need the additional assumption of a well-dened clustering limit. we have:

htrn 2(x1)   trn 2(xn)i = tr(cid:0) trn 2(x1)   trn 2(xn)(cid:1)

n 1

hu| trn 2(x1) p trn 2(x2) p   p trn 2(xn)|ui ,

=

1
n

xu=0

(4.11)

where p denotes the sum over a complete set of states. at this point the generalized notion

of the clustering assumption enters. we assume there exists a mass gap  that is dynamically

generated in the theory, and we consider the n insertion points are suciently far separated in
euclidean space compared to this scale: |xixj|  1. (since gn is a constant even in leading
semiclassical order, moving to this regime does not entail any additional approximations.)

in this regime, the generalized cluster decomposition (in our present usage) is equivalent to

the statement that p collapses to p0 where p0 is the projection operator onto vacuum states
only:

n 1

p  p0 ,

p0 =

|uihu| .

(4.12)

xu=0

using the fact that the operator trn 2 is diagonal in the u index,7 it follows that with the
replacement (4.12), the correlator (4.11) collapses to

1
n

n 1

xu=0(cid:0)j e2iu/n(cid:1)n = (j kn n = kn

0

otherwise .

(4.13)

next we consider how this elementary analysis is modied if the n-tuplet of vacua {|ui}
is supplemented by an extra vacuum state, the so-called kovner-shifman vacuum [15], which
we denote |si. a single such vacuum is permissible under the discrete symmetry only if

hs| trn 2 |si = 0 .

(4.14)

the analysis proceeds just as before, with the obvious modication that the density matrix
 should be replaced by , dened by

 = (1  p)|sihs| +

p
n

|uihu| ,

(4.15)

n 1

xu=0

where the probability p is a real number between 0 and 1. proceeding as before, we nd that

with the generalized clustering assumption

p  p

p
0 = |sihs| +

n 1

xu=0

|uihu| ,

(4.16)

7this follows from the fact that there should be no mixing between the sectors of hilbert space built on

each vacuum: they are super-selection sectors.

one derives

otherwise .

(4.17)

in the following we will calculate these (kn)-point correlators, rst analytically for large

n, then numerically for n = 2 and k = 2, and will nd a behavior quite dierent from either

(4.13) or (4.17).

v large-n calculation of gluino condensate correla-

tion functions

we now present an explicit evaluation of gn, n = kn, in the limit n   with k held xed.
our answer turns out to be incompatible with both eqs. (4.13) and (4.17). the cleanest way
to quantify this disagreement is to consider the (kn)th root, (gkn )1/kn . in the large-n limit,
from eq. (4.13), one obtains:

lim
n

(gkn )1/kn = j (n) .

(5.1)

we have written j as j (n) to allow for an unknown n dependence. the key point is
that the right-hand side of (5.1) is independent of the topological number k (as well as of

the space-time insertion points xi). note that eq. (5.1) follows, not only from eq. (4.13),
but also from eq. (4.17), so long as the constant p either has a nonzero large-n limit, or

else vanishes at large n more slowly than exponentially. alternatively, with the shifman

assumption (1.5) for p, which vanishes faster than exponentially at large n, one obtains

instead:

where e = 2.718   .

lim
n

(gkn )1/kn = (cid:16)2e

n(cid:17)1/k

j (n) ,

(5.2)

below we will calculate gkn , to leading order in 1/n, and will obtain a markedly dierent

behavior. explicitly we will nd:

lim
n

(gkn )1/kn = 252en 1k3 + o(n 2) .

(5.3)

the linear k dependence is in sharp discord with either eq. (5.1) or eq. (5.2). this disagree-

ment means that the generalized clustering assumption (4.12) is invalid when combined with

14

the instanton approximation. it also means that that the extension (4.16) of this clustering

assumption, in the presence of an extra ks vacuum state, is likewise invalid.

the large-n calculation proceeds as follows.8 in supersymmetric theories, at topological
level k, the bosonic and fermionic collective coordinates live, respectively, in complex-valued
matrices a and m, with elements:

a =(cid:18) wuj 

 )ij(cid:19) , m =(cid:18) uj
(m

)ij(cid:19) .

(a

(5.4)

the indices run over

u = 1, . . . , n ,

i, j = 1, . . . , k ,

,  = 1, 2 ;

(5.5)

traces over these indices are denoted trn , trk, and tr2, respectively. the elements of m
are grassmann (i.e., anticommuting) quantities. the k  k submatrices a
  and
m

 are subject to the hermiticity conditions

   a

nn

a
n = a

n ,

m

 = m
 .

(5.6)

in the instanton approximation, the feynman path integral is replaced by a nite-dimensional
integration over the degrees of freedom in a and m. these k-instanton collective coordinates
are weighted according to the integration measure [11, 12, 25, 26]9

(cid:0)trk t r( ma  + a m)(cid:1)i ,

(5.7)

where the two -functions enforce the bosonic and fermionic adhm constraint conditions,
respectively. the integrals over the k k matrices a
n and m are dened as the integral over
the components with respect to a hermitian basis of k  k matrices t r normalized so that
trk t rt s = rs. these matrices also provide explicit denitions of the -function factors in
the way indicated.

the form of the measure given in eq. (5.7) is known as the at measure, since the

bosonic and fermionic adhm collective coordinates are integrated over as cartesian vari-

ables, subject to the nonlinear -function constraints. in practical applications, however, it

8our conventions are taken from [11,12] which also provide self-contained reviews of the adhm formalism

for the su (n ) gauge group.

9the reason we have 2k2/2 rather than 2k2/2, as in [12], is that we restore wess and bagger integration

conventions for the m integration: r d2 2 = 1 rather than 2 where 2 =  is the square of a grassmann

weyl spinor.

15

is not the most useful form of the measure. when

n  2k ,

(5.8)

it is convenient to switch to the so-called gauge-invariant measure, involving a new set of

variables in terms of which the arguments of the -functions are linear (and hence trivially

implemented) [12]. this is the form of the measure which we will utilize in the present section.

the restriction (5.8) is obviously well suited to the large-n limit. as the name implies, the

gauge-invariant measure can only be used to integrate gauge-invariant quantities, such as our
present focus on correlators formed from trn 2. alternatively, for the special cases k  2, it
is easy to solve the nonlinear constraints explicitly without such a change of variables [9, 27].

in order to switch from the at measure to the gauge-invariant measure, one trades the

collective coordinates w and w (which transform in the n of su(n)) for the gauge-invariant

bosonic bilinear quantity w , dened by [12]

iu wuj  , w 0 = tr2 w, w c = tr2  cw, c = 1, 2, 3 .

the appropriate jacobian for this change of variables reads:

(cid:1)ij = w 
(cid:0)w 
d2kn w d2kn w  ck,n(cid:0)det2kw(cid:1)n 2kdk2

dk2

w c ,

w 0 yc=1,2,3

(5.9)

(5.10)

where

ck,n =

22kn 4k2+k 2kn 2k2+k

q2k
i=1(n  i)!

.

(5.11)

note that the bosonic -function in (5.7) can be rewritten in a gauge-invariant way as the

condition

0 = w c + [ a

n , a

m ] tr2  cnm = w c  i[ a

n , a

m ] c

nm

(5.12)

in terms of the gauge-invariant coordinates (here c
nm is an t hooft tensor [28]). as advertised,
these constraints are linear in the new variables w c; consequently the w c integrals simply
remove the bosonic adhm -functions in eq. (5.7) (giving rise to the numerical factor of
23k2 from the 1

2s in the arguments of the -functions).

next we perform a similar change of variables for the fermions, letting [12]

ui = wuj ( )ji + ui,

iu = ( )ij w 

ju + iu ,

where  lies in the orthogonal subspace to w:

w 

iuuj = 0 ,

iuwuj  = 0 .

and the constraint -functions have been eliminated for all k satisfying eq. (5.8). for k = 1,

one recovers the expression (2.1), a comparison which xes the normalization constant c1:

for k = 2, we recapture the osborn measure discussed in refs. [9, 25, 27], which we utilize in

c1 = 2n +1/23n .

(5.17)

sec. vi below.

into this measure we now insert

trn 2(x1)      trn 2(xkn ) ,

(5.18)

where the gluino (x) is replaced in the instanton approximation by a general superposition
of adjoint fermion zero modes. in terms of the previously introduced collective coordinates
a and m, a useful identity states [12]:

trn 2(x) =  1

4

(cid:3) trk

m(p + 1)mf ,

where the adhm quantities p and f are dened as:

p = 1  f  ,

f = ( )1 ,  = a + bx ,

(5.19)

(5.20)

and b is the (n + 2k) (2k) matrix whose lower 2k  2k part is the identity  
 il and whose
upper n  2k part is zero (quaternionic multiplication is implied in the product bx). as
discussed earlier, gkn (x1, . . . , xkn ) is actually a constant, independent of the xi. the xi can
therefore be chosen for maximum simplicity of the algebra. however, the simplest conceivable
choice, xi = 0 for all i, results in an ill-dened answer of the form 0   (the zero coming
from unsaturated grassmann integrations, and the innity from divergences in the bosonic

integrations due to coincident poles); we have already noted this fact in the 1-instanton sector

in sec. ii above. the simplest choice of the xi that avoids this problem turns out to be:

x1 =    = xkn k2 = 0 ,
xkn k2+1 =    = xkn = x

17

(5.21)

which we adopt for the remainder of this section.10

in the large-n limit the large preponderance of the insertions (5.21) are at xi = 0, and the
resulting factor of (trn 2(0))kn k2, taken together with the jacobian factor (det2kw )n 2k
from the measure (5.16), dominate the integral and can be treated in saddle-point approxi-

mation. below we will carry out this saddle-point evaluation in full detail, but we can already

quite easily understand the source of the linear dependence on k in the nal result (5.3). the

chain of argument goes as follows:

1. let us imagine carrying out all the grassmann integrations in the problem. the

remaining large-n integrand will then have the form exp(cid:0) n +o(log n)(cid:1) where  might

be termed the eective large-n bosonic instanton action. the large-n saddle-points are

then the stationary points of  with respect to the bosonic collective coordinates. by lorentz
symmetry,  can only depend on the four k k matrices a
n. (this
is because the bulk of the insertions have been chosen to be at xi = 0; otherwise one could
form the lorentz scalar xna

n and so have odd powers of a

n through even powers of a

n.) it follows that the ansatz

a
n = 0 , n = 1, 2, 3, 4 ,
w c = 0 ,

c = 1, 2, 3

(5.22a)

(5.22b)

is automatically a stationary point of  with respect to these collective coordinates. (note

that (5.22b) follows automatically from (5.22a) by virtue of the adhm constraints (5.12).)

it will actually turn out that, once one assumes these saddle-point values,  is independent
of the remaining collective coordinate matrix w 0; furthermore we will verify that this saddle-
point is actually a minimum of the euclidean action.

2. having anticipated the saddle-point (5.22a)-(5.22b) using these elementary symmetry

considerations, let us back up to a stage in the analysis prior to the grassmann integration,
and proceed a little more carefully. evaluating the insertions trn 2(xi) on this saddle-point,
one easily veries that the  modes vanish when xi = 0; consequently the  integrations
must be saturated entirely from the k2 insertions at xi = x. this leaves the m,  and 
integrations to be saturated purely from the insertions at xi = 0. moreover, because m
carries a weyl spinor index  whereas  and  do not, the trn 2(0) insertions depend on
these grassmann coordinates only through bilinears of the form    or m m; there are
no cross terms.

3. performing all the grassmann integrations then automatically generates a combina-

10as a nontrivial check on our algebra, we have also numerically integrated the large-n correlator for

insertions other than eq. (5.21), and veried the constancy of the answer presented below.

18

toric factor

(k2)! (k2)! (kn  2k2)! (cid:18)kn  k2

k2 (cid:19) .

(5.23)

here the rst three factors account for the indistinguishable bilinear insertions of the , m,
and {, } modes, respectively, while the nal factor counts the ways of selecting the k2
bilinears in m from the kn  k2 insertions at xi = 0. multiplying these combinatoric factors
together, as well as the normalization constants ck,n (c1)k from eq. (5.16), and taking the
(kn)th root yields, in the large-n limit:

lim

n(cid:2)ck,n (c1)k (k2)! (kn  k2)!(cid:3)1/kn

= 232en 1k3 + o(n 2) .

(5.24)

remarkably, apart from a factor of four, this back-of-the-envelope analysis precisely accounts

for the previously announced nal answer, eq. (5.3). note that most of the remaining

contributions to the saddle-point analysis, which involve a specic convergent bosonic integral
derived below, as well as the factor 29k2/2/vol u(k) from eq. (5.16), reduce to unity when the
(kn)th root is taken in the large-n limit; the missing factor of four will simply come from
the leading saddle-point evaluation of the bosonic integrand.

here are the details of the large-n calculation of gkn . since the problem has an obvious
u(k) symmetry [12], we will nd it convenient to work in a basis where w 0 (which transforms
in the adjoint of the u(k)) is diagonal:

w 0 =

.

(5.25)

as the notation implies, in the dilute instanton gas limit i can be identied with the scale
size of the ith instanton in the k-instanton sector (see sec. ii.4 of [12]). the appropriate
change of variables reads:

where the combinatoric factors in (5.32) (as well as in (5.30)) have been explained previ-

finally we turn to the {, } integrations. since (unlike the  and m modes) the num-
ber of  and  modes grows with n as kn  2k2, it does not suce merely to plug in the
saddle-point values (5.22a)-(5.22b) and (5.27). one must also calculate the gaussian deter-
minant about the saddle-point, which provides an o(n 0) multiplicative contribution to the
answer. accordingly we expand about (5.22a)-(5.22b) to quadratic order in the a
n. the  
contribution to trn 2(0) has the form

11one can easily check that these large-n formulae are consistent with the explicit 1-instanton calculation

vi the 4-point function of the gluino condensate in

su (2) gauge theory

we have seen that cluster decomposition fails (both with and without a ks vacuum) in the

sci calculation of the gluino condensate, for gauge group su(n) in the large-n limit. in

21

this section we focus instead on the gauge group su(2). in this case, at the 1-instanton level,

the 2-point function (1.2) works out to:

(cid:28) tr2(x1)

162

tr2(x2)

162 (cid:29) = 4

5 6 .

(6.1)

here we will calculate the 4-point function, which receives a nonzero contribution at the

2-instanton level:

tr2(x2)

tr2(x3)

162

tr2(x4)

162 (cid:29) = c12 .

(6.2)

in the absence of a ks vacuum, generalized cluster decomposition together with eq. (6.1)
predicts c = (4/5)2 = .64. alternatively, in the presence of a ks vacuum, weighted according
to eq. (1.5) in order to reconcile the sci and wci 1-instanton calculations, one expects

c = 4/5 = .8. instead, we have calculated c numerically, and nd:

as mentioned above, for k = 2, one can eliminate the -function constraints in eq. (5.7)

without changing variables. another simplication for the particular gauge group su(2) is

that one can adopt a concise quaternionic representation for the adhm bosonic collective
coordinates, taking advantage of the fact that su(2) = sp(1). specically, the 16 gauge and
8 gaugino collective coordinates live, respectively, in the following matrices:12

a = 

where a = a  = ann
  and the matrices an as well as m are real-valued (unlike the
complex-valued collective coordinates of the same name introduced in eq. (5.4) which are

coordinates is detailed in refs. [9, 25, 27], and reads:

into this measure one inserts the 4-point function of the classical condensate, expressed as

a function of the 2-instanton collective coordinates (6.4). the 8-dimensional grassmann
integrations over {1, 2,m
22} are then accomplished in two steps. the rst step
is to expand the integrand in terms of grassmann variables using a modied version of
the program dill, written for mathematica.13 the second step involves the explicit
grassmann integration, accomplished using an awk-script implemented on a unix system

11,m

and made to perform the symbolic algebra of grassmann integration.

the resulting 16-dimensional bosonic integration over {w1, w2, a

22}, the remaining
quaternionic variables, is carried out using a standard monte carlo integration procedure.

the integrable singularities are handled using the standard procedure: rstly, dropping a tiny

region around the integrable singularities and then making sure that the contribution from

this dropped region is negligibly smaller than the precision required. after 133 million points

have been sampled, we have obtained the numerical value (6.3) given above. as a check

on our numerics, we have also veried the constancy of the answer by comparing dierent

choices for the four space-time insertion points.

vii discussion

the mismatch between the strong coupling and weak coupling calculations is a fascinating

puzzle. previously, only the mismatch at the one instanton level was known; now we see a

mismatch, established at large n for all instanton numbers, and for n = 2 at the 2-instanton

level. certainly we not mean to imply that, because of this mismatch, sci calculations
are all necessarily suspect; indeed an n = 4 supersymmetric version of an sci calculation
performed by some of us [12] has recently provided a dramatic quantitative and qualitative

verication of maldacenas conjecture. however in this case the coupling does not run and
the calculation can be performed at weak coupling, actually small g2n, where the instanton

13dill is a mathematica package originally written by vladan lucic in 1994 in order to simplify susy
algebraic expressions. this program can be modied so that it can handle the large number of grassmann
variables that we need.

23

approximation is fully justied. the continuation to strong coupling, large g2n, is then
accomplished by means of a non-renormalization theorem. rather, our objections to the sci

computation are more narrow and technical in scope: specically, our calculations imply a

fundamental breakdown of clustering in the instanton approximation to the gluino condensate

at strong coupling. one may wonder what the origin for this breakdown is? the usual
justication for the strong coupling calculation is that one can take |xi  xj| much smaller
than the scale of strong coupling eects 1 and so the theory would be weakly coupled,
due to asymptotic freedom, and the instanton calculation would be justied. then, since

the correlation functions (4.2) are independent of the positions, the result would be valid

at all distances. this point-of-view has simultaneously been used and criticized by various

authors [2, 6, 8]. on the contrary it seems that the wci calculation uses a method that has

amassed a considerable pedigree. these kinds of calculations appear to be consistent in all

applications and agree with other non-instanton methods [19]; for example, the two-instanton
check of the seiberg-witten approach to n = 2 theories [9, 10] and the latter calculation in
sec. iii.

it seems to us that, in the strong coupling calculation, we are doing a semi-classical

approximation, namely the instanton approximation, outside the range of its validity. there

is no reason to suppose that other non-perturbative, but non-instantonic, congurations will

not contribute to the correlation functions and reconcile the strong and the weak coupling

calculations. it is unfortunate that, based on our results, the highly original and intriguing,

both theoretically and phenomenologically, proposal of shifman, namely the existence of a

chirally symmetric vacuum state, loses much of its raison detre. then again, we have not

actually ruled out the existence of such a state. after the completion of this work, it has been

suggested that the mixing parameter p of the ks vacuum, dened in eq. (4.15) above, may

actually be instanton number dependent [29]. prima facie, this appears to be incompatible
with invariance under large gauge transformations (|ki  |k +1i); however, if such a counter-
intuitive exibility is permissible in the denition of the instanton vacuum, clustering in the

presence of the ks vacuum can be saved.

conceptual diculties with the instanton approximation and cluster decomposition were

pointed out in the context of pure (non-supersymmetric) qcd some time ago. since this may

have some bearing on the present discussion, we review some comments of luscher regarding

this issue [30]. the pure instanton, i.e. no anti-instantons, approximation to qcd obviously

violates parity since

parity is then recovered by summing over instantons and anti-instantons, however, in this

in order to resolve this clustering conundrum, it is apparent that additional congurations,

which may, in the dilute gas limit, be thought as mixtures of instantons and anti-instantons,

would need to be incorporated in the approximation.

in our view, the results of this paper imply something analogous in the n = 1 theory:
additional congurations must contribute to the correlators at strong coupling and resolve

the breakdown of clustering. in fact, it was suspected some time ago (see ref. [27, 31] and

references therein) that in strongly coupled theories, it may be more appropriate to think

of instantons as composite congurations of some more basic objects: so-called instanton

partons. the dominant contributions to the path integral at strong coupling would then

arise from the partons themselves. in ref. [32], we make this piece of folklore more precise

by identifying instanton partons with the monopole congurations of the supersymmetric
yang-mills compactied on the cylinder r3  s1, with the circle having circumference .
each monopole has precisely two gluino zero modes, rather than four for the instanton. the

instanton itself is then identied with a specic two-monopole conguration. we calculate

the monopole contribution to the gluino condensate and then, at the end of the day, take the
decompactication limit   . the value of the gluino condensate obtained in this way,
is precisely the wci result (1.4).

appendix a: constancy of the correlators

since the constancy of the correlation function (4.2) plays such an important role in our

analysis, in this appendix, we review the arguments leading to this result. more importantly,

25

we explain how the eld theory proof remains valid in the instanton approximation.

first the eld theory proof [1, 2]. the argument is completely general and applies to the

correlation functions of any lowest component a of a chiral supereld :

 = a(x) + 2(x) +    .

(a.1)

in the present discussion, the operator tr 2 is the lowest component of the chiral supereld
tr w w, where w is supersymmetric eld strength. consider the correlation function

we will show that this is independent of the xis. to this end, one has

where the last line follows by commuting the q  through the other insertions, to the left and
right, respectively, until it hits the vacuum which it annihilates. but [ q , aj(x)] = 0 and
therefore the right-hand side of (a.4) vanishes and consequently the correlation function is,

indeed, independent of the insertion points. qed.

if the multiple correlator of tr 2 is constant in the full eld theory, it then becomes an
issue as to whether this constancy is retained in the instanton approximation. that it is,

rests upon two facts. firstly, the supersymmetry transformations of the elds can be traded

for supersymmetry transformations of the collective coordinates [1, 10, 11, 25, 26]. in other

words, the supersymmetry algebra is represented on the collective coordinates. specically,
under an innitesimal supersymmetry transformation q +  q:

a  =  m,
m = 4ib,

a  =  m  

 m = 4ib .

26

(a.5a)

(a.5b)

in particular, (a.3) will hold, with the elds replaced by their expression in the instanton

background and with the right-hand side involving the appropriate transformation of the

collective coordinates. ipso facto, the argument leading to (a.4) will hold with the transfor-
mations acting on the collective coordinates; moreover [ q , a] = 0, understood as a trans-
formation of the collective coordinates. the remaining piece of the proof is the analogue
of the fact that q  annihilates the vacuum state. in the instanton approximation, where
the functional integral is approximated by the integral over the collective coordinates, the

analogue of the statement that the vacuum is a supersymmetry invariant, is the statement

that the measure on the space of collective coordinates is invariant under the supersymmetry

transformations (a.5a)-(a.5b). this invariance was proved in [25, 26].
