abstract

we construct the world-volume action for non-bps d-branes in type ii string theo-
ries. this action is invariant under all the unbroken supersymmetries in the bulk, but
these symmetries are realised as spontaneously broken symmetries in the world-volume
theory. coupling of this action to background supergravity elds is straightforward. we
also discuss the fate of the u(1) gauge eld on the d-brane world-volume after tachyon
condensation.

introduction and summary

during the last year it has been realised that type iia (iib) string theory admits unstable
non-bps d-branes of odd (even) dimensions[1, 2, 3]. these d-branes can give rise to stable
non-bps d-branes after we mod out the original type ii string theory by some discrete
symmetry group[4, 5, 6, 1, 7, 2, 8]. since the non-bps d-brane is not invariant under any
of the space-time supersymmetry transformations, the spectrum on the world-volume of
these d-branes does not have bose-fermi degeneracy in general, although in some special
cases the spectrum can develop accidental bose-fermi degeneracy[9].

however, although there is no manifest supersymmetry in the world-volume theory,
we still expect the world-volume theory to be supersymmetric, with the supersymmetry
realised as a spontaneously broken symmetry.2 the supersymmetry generators of the
bulk theory, acting on the non-bps d-brane, produce fermion zero modes which can be
identied as the goldstinoes associated with the spontaneously broken supersymmetry.
indeed, even for an ordinary bps d-brane, which is invariant under half of the space-
time supersymmetry of the bulk theory[10], the world-volume theory possesses all the
supersymmetries of the bulk theory, with half of them realised as unbroken symmetries,
and the other half realised as spontaneously broken symmetries.

in this paper we shall construct the supersymmetric generalization of the dirac-born-
infeld (dbi) action describing the dynamics of light modes on the world-volume of a

non-bps d-brane. in section 2 we focus on the world-volume theory of the massless elds
of non-bps d-brane of type ii string theory in minkowski space-time. as we shall see,
this can be constructed with almost no work, using the -symmetric action for a bps
d-brane derived in ref.[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. in the convention of refs.[14, 15, 16] the
 symmetric action for a bps d-brane has two parts,  the supersymmetric dbi action
and the wess-zumino term. each of these terms is separately invariant under the full
set of space-time supersymmetry transformations, but only the combined system has 
gauge invariance. to begin with, the action has double the number of fermionic degrees
of freedom compared to the number of physical degrees of freedom on a bps d-brane, but
xing the  gauge symmetry removes half of these degrees of freedom. we show that the
world-volume action describing the non-bps d-brane is given by just the supersymmetric
dbi part of the  symmetric action describing a bps d-brane. by construction the action
is invariant under all the space-time supersymmetries. but it does not have the  gauge
symmetry, and hence the number of physical massless fermionic degrees of freedom is
exactly double of that on a bps d-brane. this is precisely the case for a non-bps d-
brane. the open strings living on a non-bps d-brane have an extra sector in which the
gso projection is reversed, and hence there are double the number of massless fermionic
degrees of freedom on a non-bps d-brane compared to that on a bps d-brane[5, 6, 1].
if we want to construct the world-volume action of a non-bps d-brane on an orbifold
or an orientifold of type ii string theory, then typically the action is obtained from the
action described above by removing the degrees of freedom which are projected out under
the orientifold or the orbifold operation. however, in some cases we may get extra light
degrees of freedom after the orbifold/orientifold operation. thus for example a type i 0-
brane acquires extra fermionic zero modes from open string stretched between the 0-brane
and the 9-brane[6, 1]; these degrees of freedom are not present in the 0-brane of type iib
string theory. another example involves non-bps d-brane of type ii string theory on a
k3 orbifold. in this case at special points in the moduli space of k3 the world-volume
theory of the brane may contain extra massless scalar elds which are not present in the
non-bps d-branes of type ii string theory in the ten dimensional minkowski space-time.
in section 3 we discuss inclusion of these elds in the world-volume action maintaining
supersymmetry of the world-volume action.

in section 4 we discuss the eect of including the tachyon in the world-volume action
of the non-bps d-brane of type ii string theory in minkowski space-time. in this case

3

the tachyon mass2 is of the order of the string scale, and hence there is no systematic way
of constructing the eective world-volume action involving the tachyon. but we can still
write down the general form of the action that maintains supersymmetry. from general
arguments one expects that at the minimum of the tachyon potential the conguration
is indistinguishible from the vacuum[17], and hence the u(1) gauge eld and the other
degrees of freedom on the d-brane world-volume should disappear; but exactly how this
happens has not been completely understood[18, 7, 19]. we show that if we ignore terms
involving derivatives of the gauge eld strength and the acceleration of the brane, then at
the minimum of the tachyon potential the world-volume action vanishes identically. thus
the gauge eld now acts as a lagrange multiplier eld which imposes the constraint that
the u(1) gauge current must vanish identically. this would explain the disappearance
of the u(1) gauge eld at the tachyonic ground state, but in order to reach a denitive
conclusion we need to study the eect of the terms in the world-volume action involving
higher derivatives which were ignored in our analysis.

2 world-volume action of massless elds for non-bps

d-branes in type ii string theory

we shall begin with type iia string theory, which admits bps d-branes of even dimension
and non-bps d-branes of odd dimension. our focus of attention will be a non-bps dp-
brane with p odd, and we shall attempt to construct the world-volume action involving
the massless elds on the brane by integrating out all the massive modes, including the
tachyon.3 throughout this section we shall consider the background space-time to be
ten dimensional minkowski space with no background elds, but as we shall point out
at the end of the section, coupling to background supergravity elds is straightforward.
let  (0    p) denote the coordinates on the world-volume of the d-brane. the
open strings living on such a d-brane has two chan paton (cp) sectors, the sector
labelled by the 2  2 identity matrix i, and the sector labeled by the pauli matrix 1[1].
the massless dynamical degrees of freedom on the d-brane world-volume are a set of
10 bosonic coordinate elds x m () (0  m  9), a u(1) gauge eld a, and a 32
component fermionic eld  which transforms as a majorana spinor under the space-time

modes amounts to eliminating them using their equations of motion.

lorentz group so(9,1), but is a world-volume scalar. the eld  can be regarded as
the sum of a left-handed majorana-weyl fermion l and a right-handed majorana-weyl
fermion r. of these all the elds except l come from the cp sector i, and l comes
from the sector 1.4 for comparison let us note that the spectrum of massless elds
coming from the sector i is identical to that on the world-volume of a bps dp brane of
type iib string theory. thus for the bps dp-brane the fermionic eld transforms in the
majorana-weyl representation rather than in a majorana representation.

the world-volume action of the non-bps d-brane involving these elds must satisfy

the following criteria:

1. it must be invariant under all the global supersymmetries of type iia string theory
in the bulk. the supersymmetry transformation parameter is a majorana spinor 
of so(9,1).

2. if we set l = 0, then we are left with only the elds originating in the identity
sector. except for an overall normalization factor representing the dierence in the
tension of a non-bps and a bps d-brane, the resulting eective action must agree
with that on a bps dp-brane of type iib string theory. this follows from the
observation that the rules for computing the open string amplitudes on a non-bps
d-brane are identical to that on the bps d-brane except for the presence of the
chan-paton factors[1], and a cp factor i only contributes an overall normalization
factor to the amplitude.

we shall now use these guidelines to construct the world-volume action on the non-

bps dp-brane of type iia string theory. let us dene:

m

 = x m  m  ,

g = m n m

 n
 ,

and

f = f  [11m (x m 

m )  (  )] ,

2

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

where m denote the ten dimensional gamma matrices, 11 is the product of all the gamma
matrices, m n is the ten dimensional minkowski metric with signature (1, 1, . . . 1), and

4of course by changing our convention we could have the right-handed component of  come from

sector 1 and the left-handed component come from the sector i.

f = a  a .

(2.4)

5

we now claim that the following action satises the two conditions listed above:

s = cz dp+1q det(g + f) ,

(2.5)

where c is a constant equal to the dp-brane tension.

first let us check that it has the required amount of supersymmetry. for this note
that this action has the same structure as the rst term of the  symmetric action of a
bps d-brane of type iia string theory as discussed in ref.[16], except that p is odd instead
of even in the present case. as shown in [16], both g and f are invariant under the
supersymmetry transformations:

 = ,

x m = m ,
1
6

a = 11m x m 

(11m  m  + m  11m ) ,

(2.6)

where the supersymmetry transformation parameter  is a majorana spinor of so(9,1)
lorentz group. since g and f are invariant under the supersymmetry transformation,
the action s dened in (2.5) is also invariant under this transformation.

in order to check that this reproduces the world-volume action of the bps dp-brane
of type iib string theory when we set the fermionic eld l coming from the cp sector
1 to zero, let us dene l and r through the relations:

 = l + r,

l11 = l,

r11 = r .

(2.7)

as discussed earlier, we can take r to originate in the identity sector and l to originate
in the 1 sector. setting l to zero gives us

g +f = m n x m x n +f 2rm x m r +(rm r)(rm r) . (2.8)

the action obtained by substituting this into eq.(2.5) agrees with the world-volume action
of a bps dp-brane of type iib string theory after xing the  gauge symmetry[16]. the
r appearing in (2.8) has to be identied to the eld  of ref.[16].

besides supersymmetry, the action (2.5) also has several other symmetries. they

include space-time translation symmetry,

x m = m ,

 = 0,

a = 0 ,

(2.9)

and the so(9,1) lorenz symmetry,

x m = m

n x n ,

 = r(),

a = 0 .

(2.10)

6

here m
n denotes an innitesimal element of the so(9,1) algebra, and r() is the ma-
jorana spinor representation of . finally, the action is manifestly invariant under the
reparametrization of the world-volume coordinate :

  f () ,

(2.11)

for some set of functions {f ()}. x  and  transform as world-volume scalars and a
transforms as a world-volume vector under this transformation. (2.11) represents a gauge
symmetry of the action. a convenient choice of gauge is the static gauge:

if we dene

 = x 

for

0    p .

i = x i

for

p + 1  i  9 ,

then g + f can be rewritten in the static gauge as:

g + f =  + ijij + f

2l( + ii)l  2r( + ii)r
+(lm l)(lm l + rm r)
+(rm r)(lm l + rm r) .

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

if we set l = 0, and rename r as , the action agrees with the action of bps dp-brane
of type iib string theory in the static gauge, as given in ref.[16].

the gauge xed action is no longer invariant under the symmetry transformations
(2.6), (2.9), (2.10). instead, each of these symmetry transformations must be accompanied
by a compensating gauge transformation which brings us back to the gauge x  = .

thus we must dene the new symmetry transformations b as a combination of the old

transformations  and a world volume reparametrization, such that

thus the new transformation laws b for any world-volume scalar eld  (e.g. x m or )

will be given in terms of the old transformation laws  as follows:

bx () = 0 .

(2.15)

b,, = ,,  (

,,) ,

(2.16)

7

where



 = ,



 = ,



 = (

 + 

ii) .

(2.17)

if we take  = x , then it is easy to check using eqs.(2.6), (2.9), (2.10), (2.16) and (2.17)
that eq.(2.15) is indeed satised. for world-volume vector eld a the right hand side of
eq.(2.16) contains an extra term (

,,)a.

let us now turn to non-bps dp-branes of type iib string theory. in this case p is
even. the bosonic massless elds again consist of the scalar elds x m () and the gauge
elds a(), but now, instead of a fermionic eld  transforming as a majorana spinor of
so(9,1), we have a pair of fermionic elds 1 and 2, each transforming in the right-handed
majorana-weyl spinor representation of so(9,1).5 we dene

 = (cid:18) 1

2(cid:19) ,

(2.18)

and let 3 denote the matrix (cid:18) i

i(cid:19) acting on , where i denotes the identity matrix

acting on 1 and 2. we also dene

m

g = m n m

f = f  [3m (x m

s = cz dp+1q det(g + f) ,

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

where c is a constant equal to the dp-brane tension. it is easy to check that g and
f, and hence s, is invariant under the supersymmetry transformation:

 = ,

x m = m ,

a = 3m x m 

1
6

(3m  m  + m  3m ) ,

(2.23)

5since the fermion zero modes from cp factor 1 carry opposite gso projection compared to those
from cp factor i, one might wonder how we can get a pair of fermion elds of same so(9,1) chirality. for
this note that in the static gauge (in which the open string spectrum is computed) only an so(p,1)so(9
p) subgroup of the full so(9,1) lorentz group is realized as a manifest symmetry. since p is even for type
iib string theory, neither so(9  p) nor so(p, 1) has chiral spinor representation. as a result, both a left-
handed and a right-handed majorana-weyl spinor of so(9,1) will transform in the same representation of
so(p, 1)so(9  p). thus knowing the gso projection rules we cannot determine the so(9,1) chirality
of the fermion elds.
it is determined by requiring that these fermions represent the goldstino elds
associated with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.

8

where the supersymmetry transformation parameter  is given by (cid:18) 1

2(cid:19), with 1 and 2

both right-handed majorana spinor of so(9,1) lorentz group.

if we set 1 = 0 and identify 2 with , we recover the world-volume action of a bps
dp-brane of type iia string theory after  gauge xing, as given in ref.[16]. thus the
action (2.22) satises the required consistency conditions. as in the case of type iia
string theory, this action also has space-time translation symmetry and ten dimensional
lorentz invariance; these transformation laws are given by equations identical to (2.9),
(2.10). finally it has world-volume reparametrization invariance, and using this we can
go to a static gauge x  = . the gauge xed action has a form identical to that for
type iia non-bps d-branes except that l and r in eq.(2.14) are replaced by 1 and 2
respectively. the various transformation laws get modied in the static gauge according
to eqs.(2.16), (2.17) as before.

we conclude this section by noting that the coupling of the d-brane world-volume
theory discussed here to background supergravity elds can be carried out following the
procedure given in ref.[14, 15]. again for type iia (iib) string theory the action is obtained
by keeping only the supersymmetric dbi term of the -symmetric action describing bps
d-brane of type iia (iib) string theory in a supergravity background, and taking p to be
odd (even) instead of even (odd).

3

inclusion of other light elds

the non-bps dp-branes of type ii string theory are unstable due to the existence of a
tachyonic mode on their world-volume[1, 2]. but quite often we can get stable non-bps
branes by taking certain orientifolds/orbifolds of type ii string theory, if this operation
projects out the tachyonic mode[5, 6, 1, 2, 8]. typically, this will also project out a subset
of the massless degrees of freedom on the d-brane world-volume, and the world-volume
action of the resulting d-brane will be given by an appropriate truncation of the actions
(2.5) or (2.22). but in some cases there are extra (nearly) massless degrees of freedom
on the world-volume, which, if present, must be included in the world volume action.
thus we need to know how to couple these elds maintaining the ten dimensional super-
poincare invariance and world-volume reparametrization invariance. we shall discuss two
examples.

9

3.1 light scalars on non-bps d-brane on t 4/z2 near a critical

radius

this system was discussed in detail in refs.[2, 8, 20, 9]. we begin with a non-bps d-brane
of type iia/iib string theory on t 4 with an odd number n of tangential directions of the
d-brane along t 4, and mod out the resulting conguration by the z2 transformation i4
that reverses the sign of all four coordinates of the torus. at a generic point in the moduli
space of the torus the massless degrees of freedom consist of a subset of the elds living
on the d-brane before the orbifold projection. in order to simplify the action, we can do a
partial gauge xing by identifying n of the world-volume coordinates of the brane to the n
coordinates of the torus along which the brane extends. in this case these n world-volume
coordinates will be compact, and we can dimensionally reduce the original world-volume
action by ignoring the dependence of all elds on these compact coordinates. this gives
a (p  n + 1)-dimensional world-volume theory. this dimensional reduction has been
carried out in detail in [16]. in this dimensionally reduced action we then set to zero the
elds which are odd under i4. we shall continue to denote by  the coordinates of this
world-volume theory, although now  runs over (p  n + 1) values.

an alternative procedure will be to make a series of n t-duality transformations which
converts the dp-brane to a d(p  n)-brane, with all the (p  n) tangential directions of
the brane lying along the non-compact directions[2, 8]. since n is odd, this t-duality
transforms i4 into i4  (1)fl where (1)fl denotes the contribution to the space-time
fermion number from the left-moving sector of the closed string world-sheet[23]. the
world-volume action of the brane is then obtained by starting from the world-volume
action of the non-bps d(p  n)-brane discussed in the previous section, and setting to
zero all the elds which are odd under (1)fl  i4. both these procedures lead to the
same result.

at certain critical values of the radii of the torus we can get one or more extra massless
scalar elds[2, 8, 20].6 for simplicity we shall take only one of the radii to be near the
critical radius, so that we have only one nearly massless scalar eld. let us denote this
eld by . when all the other massless elds are set to zero, the low energy eective
action for  takes the following form in the static gauge:

1

2 z dpn+1(  v ()) ,

(3.1)

6for a closely related example in type i string theory, see refs.[6, 21, 22].

10

where v () is the tachyon potential constructed in [20]. in writing (3.1) we have ignored
terms with more than two derivatives of .

we propose the following supersymmetric and reparametrization invariant coupling of

the action (3.1) to other massless elds on the d-brane world-volume:

z dpn+1q det(g + f ) (eg

s   v ()) ,

(3.2)

where eg denotes the matrix inverse of (g + f ), and egs denotes the symmetric part of
eg. in writing (3.2) we have further ignored terms involving derivatives of g and f . this

action clearly satises the requirement of space-time supersymmetry and world-volume
reparametrization invariance provided we take  to be a world-volume scalar and inert
under supersymmetry transformation:

 = 0 .

(3.3)

example, instead of using the metric eg

however, the requirement of supersymmetry alone does not x the form of the action. for
s , we could have used the metric g, the matrix
inverse of g, in the term involving . in order to resolve this ambiguity, we have
used the result of ref.[24]. ref.[24] analysed open string theory in the presence of constant
background metric and anti-symmetric tensor eld, and showed that the natural metric
for open strings is the symmetric part of the inverse of (g + b) where g and b are
respectively the pullback of the metric and the antisymmetric tensor eld on the d-brane
world-volume. since in the d-brane world-volume action the gauge eld always appears
in the combination (b + f), we can use the result of ref.[24] to conclude that in the
presence of a constant background gauge eld strength f, the natural metric appearing
in the kinetic term of  is the symmetric part of the inverse of (g + f ). the requirement
of space-time supersymmetry then xes the form of the action (3.2).7

note that although  does not transform under supersymmetry in the gauge invariant
description, it does transform under supersymmetry according to eqs.(2.16), (2.17) in the
static gauge.

7of course the antisymmetric part of constant background eg  has the eect of making the ordinary

products in (3.2) into non-commutative  products[25, 26, 27, 24]. this can be reexpressed in terms
of ordinary products by including terms with higher derivatives. in the present case these extra terms
vanish due to symmetry reasons.

11

3.2 fermionic zero modes on the type i d-particle

type i d-particle is obtained by modding out the type iib d-particle by the world-sheet
parity transformation [6, 1]. the massless degrees of freedom on the world volume
contains a subset of the world-volume degrees of freedom of the type iib d-particle which
are invariant under , and the eective action involving these modes is given by the
eective action of the type iib d-particle with the  odd modes set to zero. but type i
d-particle also has 32 extra fermionic zero modes from open strings stretched between the
d0-brane and the space lling d9-branes which are present in the type i string theory.
let us denote these modes by i (0  i  32), and let us denote the world-volume
time coordinate of the d0-brane by  . we need to construct a reparametrization and
supersymmetry invariant world-volume action for these modes. we propose the following
action:

z d i i .

(3.4)

this is manifestly supersymmetry and reparametrization invariant if we take i to be a
scalar under reparametrization, and inert under supersymmetry transformation:

i = 0 .

(3.5)

as in the previous case, i acquires a non-trivial supersymmetry transformation law in
the static gauge according to the rules given in eqs.(2.16), (2.17).

4 eect of tachyon condensation on the non-bps d-

brane of type ii string theory

the non-bps d-brane of type ii string theory in ten dimensional minkowski space con-
tains a tachyonic mode besides the massless modes and the innite number of massive
modes. let us consider the eective action as a function of the tachyonic and the massless
modes, obtained by integrating out all the massive modes. since the tachyon mass2 is
of the order of the string tension, there is no systematic procedure for computing this
eective action, but we shall be interested in studying some of the general properties of
this action. if we ignore terms involving derivatives of g and f, then combining the
results of [24] with the requirement of supersymmetry, we can expect the following form

12

of the eective action:

s = z dp+1q det(g + f ) f (t, t, dt, . . . , eg

s , eg

a ) + iw z .

(4.1)

here t is the tachyon eld, and f is some function of its arguments. we have included

s

the original action (2.5), (2.22) into the denition of f so that for t = 0, f = c. eg
and eg
a denote the symmetric and the antisymmetric parts of eg  (g + f )1. the
analysis of [24] tells us that the background value of egs gives the natural metric for the
open string, whereas the eect of a background ega is to convert an ordinary product

to a non-commutative  product. iw z denotes a wess-zumino term representing the
supersymmetric generalization of the coupling of the tachyon to background ramond-
ramond elds[7, 2, 3, 28, 29, 30]. this term typically involves the wedge product of dt
with a supersymmetry invariant p-form on the d-brane world-volume. an example of
such a term will be the wedge product of dt with the wess-zumino term for the bps
d(p  1) brane constructed in refs.[14, 15, 16].

we shall be interested in analysing this action for constant t . thus t and hence

iw z vanishes. for such a background the dependence of f on egs and ega disappears,
since there are no indices with which egs can contract, and since for constant functions

the  product reduces to the ordinary product. thus the action can be rewritten as:

z dp+1q det(g + f ) v (t ) ,

(4.2)

where v is the tachyon potential.
minimum t0 of the potential v vanishes, i.e.

it has been argued on general grounds that at the

v (t0) = 0 .

(4.3)

from eq.(4.2) we see that at t = t0 the world volume action vanishes identically. thus
in this case the world-volume gauge eld acts as a lagrange multiplier eld which imposes
the constraint that the u(1) gauge current must vanish identically. as a result all states
which are charged under the u(1) (e.g. an open string with one end on this non-bps
d-brane and the other end on another d-brane) will disappear from the spectrum.

this result is similar to the result of [19] where it was argued that this u(1) gauge
eld is conned at the tachyonic ground state.8 but the mechanism proposed in [19] was

8actually [19] did not look at this problem, but to a closely related problem of tachyon condensation

on a brane-antibrane pair.

13

non-perturbative from the point of view of the d-brane world-volume theory, whereas the
mechanism discussed here is a tree level eect in the open string theory.

since (4.2) is the key result leading to the conclusion above, let us review the origin
of this equation in some detail. the main reason behind this form of the eective action

modify the x  propagator on the boundary of the disk. since the x  dependence of the

the structure of open string disk amplitude. the eect of constant background eg is to
tachyon vertex operator comes only from the momentum factors eik.x, eg can modify only
thus for constant t there is no non-trivial dependence of the eective action on eg.9
the only dependence on eg comes through the eective coupling constant of the open
string theory[24], as an overall multiplicative factor of qdet(g + f ). since this argument
works only for constant background eg, it does not give us any information about terms
involving derivatives of eg. whether inclusion of these terms in our analysis changes the

conclusion remains to be seen. unfortunately there does not seem to be any systematic
procedure for analysing these terms.
