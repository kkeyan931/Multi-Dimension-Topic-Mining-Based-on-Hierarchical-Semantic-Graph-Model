abstract

we summarize recent results on the resolution of two intimately related problems,
one physical, the other mathematical. the rst deals with the resolution of the non-
perturbative low energy dynamics of certain n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theories.
we concentrate on the theories with one massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint represen-
tation of an arbitrary gauge algebra g. the second deals with the construction of lax
pairs with spectral parameter for certain classical mechanics calogero-moser integrable
systems associated with an arbitrary lie algebra g. we review the solution to both of
these problems as well as their interrelation.

i. introduction

some of the most important physical problems of contemporary theoretical physics

concern the behavior of gauge theories and string theory at strong coupling. for gauge
theories, these include the problems of connement of color, of dynamical chiral symmetry

breaking, of the strong coupling behavior of chiral gauge theories, of the dynamical breaking
of supersymmetry. in each of these areas, major advances have been achieved over the past

few years, and a useful resolution of some of these dicult problems appears to be within
sight. for string theory, these include the problems of dynamical compactication of the
10-dimensional theory to string vacua with 4 dimensions and of supersymmetry breaking

at low energies. already, it has become clear that, at strong coupling, the string spectrum
is radically altered and eectively derives from the unique 11-dimensional m-theory.

this rapid progress was driven in large part by the seiberg-witten solution of n = 2
supersymmetric yang-mills theory for su (2) gauge group [1] and by the discovery of d-

branes in string theory. some of the key ingredients underlying these developments are

(1) restriction to solving for the low energy behavior of the non-perturbative dynamics,

summarized by the low energy eective action of the theory.

(2) high degrees of supersymmetry. this has the eect of imposing certain holomorphicity

constraints on parts of the low energy eective action, and thus of restricting its form
considerably. for gauge theories in 4-dimensions, we distinguish the following degrees
of supersymmetry.

 n = 1 supersymmetry supports chiral fermions and is the starting point for the
minimal supersymmetric standard model, the simplest extension of the standard
model to include supersymmetric partners.

 n = 2 supersymmetry only supports non-chiral fermions and is thus less realistic
as a particle physics model, but appears better solvable. this is where the

seiberg-witten solution was constructed.

 n = 4 is the maximal amount of supersymmetry, and a special case of n =
2 supersymmetry with only non-chiral fermions and vanishing renormalization
group -function. dynamically, the latter theory is the simplest amongst 4-

dimensional gauge theories, and oers the best hopes for admitting an exact
solution.

(3) electric-magnetic and montonen-olive duality. the free maxwell equations are in-
variant under electric- magnetic duality when ~e  ~b and ~b   ~e. in the presence
of matter, duality will require the presence of both electric charge e and magnetic

2

monopole charge g whose magnitude is related by dirac quantization e  g  h. thus,
weak electric coupling is related to large magnetic coupling. conversely, problems

of large electric coupling (such as connement of the color electric charge of quarks)
are mapped by duality into problems of weak magnetic charge. it was conjectured
by montonen and olive that the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory for any
gauge algebra g is mapped under the interchange of electric and magnetic charges, i.e.
under e  1/e into the theory with dual gauge algebra g. when combined with the
shift-invariance of the instanton angle  this symmetry is augmented to the duality
group sl(2, z), or a subgroup thereof.

(4) finally, the maldacena equivalence between type iib superstring theory on ads5 s5
and 4-dimensional n = 4 superconformal yang-mills theory is conjectured to hold
at strong coupling. the ads/scft correspondence thus establishes a link between

certain non-perturbative phenomena in string theory and in gauge theory.

of central interest to many of these exciting developments is the 4-dimensional super-
symmetric yang-mills theory with maximal supersymmetry, n = 4, and with arbitrary
gauge algebra g. here, we shall consider a generalization of this theory, in which a mass
term is added for part of the n = 4 gauge multiplet, softly breaking the n = 4 symmetry
to n = 2. as an n = 2 supersymmetric theory, the theory has a g-gauge multiplet, and
a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of g with mass m.

this generalized theory enjoys many of the same properties as the n = 4 theory : it
has the same eld contents; it is ultra-violet nite; it has vanishing renormalization group
-function, and it is expected to have montonen-olive duality symmetry. for vanishing
hypermultiplet mass m = 0, the n = 4 theory is recovered. for m  , it is possible
to choose dependences of the gauge coupling and of the gauge scalar expectation values
so that the limiting theory is one of many interesting n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills
theories. amongst these possibilities for g = su (n ) for example, are the theories with any
number of hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of su (n ), or with product
gauge algebras su (n1)  su (n2)      su (np), and hypermultiplets in fundamental
and bi-fundamental representations of these product algebras.

remarkably, the seiberg-witten theory for n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory
for arbitrary gauge algebra g appears to be intimately related with the existence of certain
classical mechanics integrable systems. this relation was rst suspected on the basis of
the similarity between the seiberg-witten curves and the spectral curves of certain inte-

grable models [2]. then, arguments were developed that seiberg-witten theory naturally
produces integrable structures [3]. but a connection derived from rst principles between

3

seiberg-witten theory and integrable models still seems to be lacking.

for the n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with massive hypermultiplet, the
relevant integrable system appears to be the elliptic calogero-moser system. for su (n )

gauge group, donagi and witten [3] proposed that the spectral curves of the su (n ) hitchin
system should play the role of the seiberg-witten curves. krichever (in unpublished work),

gorsky and nekrasov, and martinec [4] recognized that the su (n ) hitchin system spec-
tral curves are identical to those of the su (n ) elliptic calogero-moser integrable system.
that the su (n ) elliptic calogero-moser curves (and associated seiberg-witten dieren-
tial) do indeed provide the seiberg-witten solution for the n = 2 theory with one massive
hypermultiplet was fully established by the authors in [5], where it was shown that

(1) the resulting eective prepotential f (and thus the low energy eective action) repro-

duces correctly the logarithmic singularities predicted by perturbation theory;

(2) f satises a renormalization group type equation which determines explicitly and

eciently instanton contributions to any order;

(3) the prepotential in the limit of large hypermultiplet mass m (as well as large gauge

scalar expectation value and small gauge coupling) correctly reproduces the prepoten-
tials for n = 2 super yang mills theory with any number of hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation of the gauge group.

the fundamental problem in seiberg-witten theory is to determine the seiberg-witten
curves and dierentials, corresponding to an n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with
arbitrary gauge algebra g, and a massive hypermultiplet in an arbitrary representation r
of g, subject to the constraint of asymptotic freedom or conformal invariance. with the
correspondence between seiberg-witten curves and the spectral curves of classical mechan-

ics integrable systems [3], this problem is equivalent to determining a general integrable
system, associated with the lie algebra g and the representation r.

the n = 2 theory for arbitrary gauge algebra g and with one massive hypermultiplet
in the adjoint representation was one such outstanding case when g 6= su (n ). actually, as
discussed previously, upon taking suitable limits, this theory contains a very large number

of models with smaller hypermultiplet representations r, and in this sense has a univer-
sal aspect. it appeared dicult to generalize directly the donagi-witten construction of
hitchin systems to arbitrary g, and it was thus natural to seek this generalization directly
amongst the elliptic calogero-moser integrable systems. it has been known now for a long

time, thanks to the work of olshanetsky and perelomov [6], that calogero-moser systems
can be dened for any simple lie algebra. olshanetsky and perelomov also showed that the

4

calogero-moser systems for classical lie algebras were integrable, although the existence
of a spectral curve (or lax pair with spectral parameter) as well as the case of exceptional

lie algebras remained open. thus several immediate questions are:

 does the elliptic calogero-moser system for general lie algebra g admit a lax pair

with spectral parameter?

 does it correspond to the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge algebra

g and a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation?

 can this correspondence be veried in the limiting cases when the mass m tends
to 0 with the theory acquiring n = 4 supersymmetry and when m  , with the
hypermultiplet decoupling in part to smaller representations of g ?

the purpose of this paper is to review the solution to these questions, which were obtained
in [7], [8] and [9]. in summary, the answers can be stated succinctly as follows.

 the elliptic calogero-moser systems dened by an arbitrary simple lie algebra g

do admit lax pairs with spectral parameters.

 the correspondence between elliptic g calogero-moser systems and n = 2 super-
symmetric g gauge theories with matter in the adjoint representation holds directly when
the lie algebra g is simply-laced. when g is not simply-laced, the correspondence is with
new integrable models, the twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems introduced in [7,8].

 the new twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems also admit a lax pair with spectral

parameter [7].

mov long ago, and present the new twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems introduced in

discuss their integrability properties and lax pairs with spectral parameter in v. finally,
in vi and vii, we discuss the seiberg-witten solution for the n = 2 supersymmetric
yang-mills theories and a massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge
algebra for g = su (n ) and for arbitrary g respectively.

5

ii. seiberg-witten theory

supersymmetric yang-mills theories are ordinary eld theories of scalar, spin 1/2
fermions and gauge elds, with eld contents tting into representations of the supersym-

metry algebra and with certain special relations between the gauge, yukawa and higgs
self-couplings. for each of n = 1, 2, 4, there is a gauge multiplet (g) in the adjoint
representation of the gauge algebra g and for n = 1, 2 there are matter multiplets (m)
in an arbitrary representation r of g.

a) supersymmetry multiplets

(1) for n = 1, we have

(g) the gauge multiplet (a, ) containing a gauge eld a and a majorana fermion ;
(m) the chiral multiplet (, ) containing a complex scalar  and a chiral fermion .

(2) for n = 2, we have

(g) the gauge multiplet (a, , ) containing a gauge eld a, a dirac fermion 
and a complex scalar , which we shall often refer to as the gauge scalar. under
an n = 1 supersymmetry subalgebra, the n = 2 gauge multiplet is the direct
sum of the n = 1 gauge multiplet and an n = 1 chiral multiplet in the adjoint
representation of g.

(m) the hypermultiplet (, h) contains a dirac fermion  and two complex scalars
h. under an n = 1 subalgebra, this multiplet is the sum of one left and one
right n = 1 chiral multiplets.

(3) for n = 4, we have

(g) the gauge multiplet (a, , i ), containing a gauge eld a, four majorana
spinors ,  = 1,    , 4 and six real scalars i , i = 1,    , 6. under an n = 2
subalgebra, the multiplet is the sum of an n = 2 gauge multiplet and an n = 2
hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge algebra g.

(m) there is no matter multiplet for n = 4.

b) supersymmetric lagrangians

for the study of seiberg-witten theory, we shall need both the n = 2 supersymmetric
microscopic (renormalizable) lagrangian as well as n = 2 supersymmetric eective la-
grangians. both types may be viewed as general lagrangians involving the multiplets given
above, but with the restriction that only terms are retained with at most two derivatives

on any term involving boson elds, and one derivative on any term involving fermion elds.
this is the usual approximation made when dealing with eective low energy theories, and

6

also happens to be one of the criteria for renormalizability. these eective lagrangians
are always polynomial in the gauge and fermion elds, but depend upon the various scalar

elds through possibly general functions. supersymmetry imposes certain holomorphic-
ity conditions on some of these functions, a property fundamental in the seiberg-witten
analysis. henceforth, we restrict to considering only such lagrangians.

for n = 1 supersymmetric theories with gauge multiplet (aa

, a), a = 1,    , dim g
and chiral multiplets (i, i), i = 1,    , nf , the key parts of the most general lagrangian
are given by the kinetic terms type and potential terms for the elds (all other terms such

as yukawa couplings are omitted, as we shall not need their form)

ab()(cid:2)

here gij = ijk(, ) is the kahler metric on the scalar elds, d are suitable covariant
derivatives with respect to the gauge eld (and the kahler connection for d on fermions),
and f is the eld strength of a. the superpotential w () and the gauge coupling eld
ab() are constrained by n = 1 supersymmetry to be complex analytic functions of .
for n = 1 supersymmetric theories, it is very convenient to derive the above results from
an n = 1 supereld formulation, in which the complex analyticity of w and ab emerges
from the fact that these functions arise in f -terms, while the kahler potential comes from
a d-term. in f -terms, only superelds of one chirality enter; since a chiral fermion is in
the same multiplet as the complex scalar eld , but not , all -dependence emerging
from f -terms is inherently complex analytic. with a generalization to n = 2 and n = 4
in mind, where no convenient o-shell supereld formulation is available, we prefer here to

use component language throughout.

for n = 2 supersymmetric theories, the gauge multiplet consists of an n = 1 gauge
multiplet and an n = 1 chiral multiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge algebra.
thus, part of the components of the chiral eld (i, i) are in the adjoint representation,
and we shall denote that part by (a, a), with the index a running through the adjoint
representation. (the remaining components make up hypermultiplets.) since the adjoint
representation is real, there is no distinction between a and a. we shall concentrate on
that part of the lagrangian (2.1) which involves only the n = 2 vector multiplet elds.

enforcing n = 2 supersymmetry on the n = 1 lagrangian (2.1) for the vector
multiplet is not so easy. however, it is straightforward to enforce some necessary conditions.

7

the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra is invariant under an su (2)r group which rotates the
two independent supercharges into one another, and thus rotates the two spinors in the
n = 2 gauge multiplet into one another as well. in the n = 1 language used in (2.1), these
two spinors are a and a. n = 2 supersymmetry requires invariance under su (2)r, and
thus invariance of the lagrangian under this symmetry. invariance of the kinetic terms for

 and  in (2.1) immediately yields a relation between the kahler metric and the gauge
coupling function

(2.2)

since ab() is a complex analytic function of , the partial derivative of (2.2) with respect
to a is complex analytic, and thus

2k(, )
ac = tabc() b

(2.3)

for some complex analytic function tabc of . the most general solution to (2.3) is very
easily obtained by integrating up twice, and may be expressed in terms of a single complex
analytic function f , called the superpotential. in terms of f , the quantities  and k are
given by

(2.4a)

(2.4b)

this restricted form of the n = 2 eective action is closely related with special geometry.

imposing su (2)r-symmetry on the yukawa couplings requires that the superpotential
for the gauge scalars be similarly restricted. the resulting expressions are rather compli-

cated, and we shall give below only the special cases needed for our analysis. analogous
conditions are required upon inclusion of hypermultiplets, but we shall not give those here.
once these necessary conditions arising from su (2)r invariance have been imposed, it may
in fact be shown that the lagrangian obtained in this way is indeed n = 2 supersymmetric
[10].

c) the set-up for seiberg-witten theory

the starting point for seiberg-witten theory is an n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory with gauge algebra g and hypermultiplets in a representation r of g with masses

8

mj. the microscopic lagrangian is completely xed by n = 2 supersymmetry in terms of
the gauge coupling g and the instanton angle , and is given by

l =

1
4g2 f a

 f a +


322 f a



f a + d d + tr[ , ]2 +   

(2.5)

where we have neglected hypermultiplet and fermion terms.

the low energy eective theory corresponding to this model can be analyzed by study-
ing rst the structure of the vacuum. n = 2 supersymmetric vacuum states can occur
whenever the vacuum energy is exactly zero. since the energy is always positive in a su-
persymmetric theory, we are guaranteed that any zero energy solution is a vacuum. this

is the case here for vanishing gauge elds and constant gauge scalar elds  for which the
potential energy term also vanishes. the potential energy vanishes if and only if [ , ] = 0,
a condition equivalent to the vacuum expectation value of  being a linear combination of
the cartan generators of the gauge algebra g,

<  >=

n

xj=1

ajhj

n = rank g

(2.6)

here, the complex parameters aj are usually referred to as the quantum moduli, or also
as the quantum order parameters of the n = 2 vacua.

for generic values of the parameters aj, the g-gauge symmetry will be broken down
to u (1)n/weyl(g), and the low energy theory is that of n dierent coulomb elds, up
to global identications by weyl(g). since n = 2 supersymmetry is unbroken in any of
these vacua, the low energy eective lagrangian will have to be invariant under n = 2
supersymmetry. but, we have already given a description of all such eective actions
before, in terms of a complex analytic superpotential f (). in the case of n dierent u (1)
gauge elds, this eective lagrangian is particularly simple, and we have

leective =

(2.7)

here, the dual gauge scalar d and the gauge coupling function ij are both given in terms
of the prepotential f

dj =

f ()

j

ij =

2f ()
ij

(2.8)

the form of the eective lagrangian (2.7) is the same for any of the values of the complex
moduli of n = 2 vacua, with the understanding that the elds j take on the expectation
value < j >= aj. since the prepotential f () is a function of the elds  only, but

9

not of derivatives of , the prepotential will be completely determined by its values on
the vacuum expectation values of the eld, namely by its values on the quantum order
parameters aj.

d) the seiberg-witten solution

the object of seiberg-witten theory is the determination of the prepotential f (aj),
from which the entire low energy eective action will be known. this is achieved by
exploiting the physical conditions satised by f [1],

(1) f (aj) is complex analytic in aj in view of n = 2 supersymmetry, as shown in b)

above.

(2) the matrix im ij = imijf is positive denite, since by (2.7), it coincides with the

metric on the kinetic terms for the gauge elds aj.

(3) the large aj behavior is known from perturbative quantum eld theory calculations

and asymptotic freedom, and is given by f (a)  (ai  aj)2 ln(ai  aj)2.

more precisely, for gauge algebra g and hypermultiplets in the representation r of g,

f (a) is of the form



f (a) =f class(a) +

fd(a)(2h

(cid:3).

here  is a dynamically generated scale introduced by renormalization, h
g is the quadratic
casimir of g (equal to the dual coxeter number), i(r) is the dynkin index of the rep-
resentation r, and r(g) and w (r) denote respectively the roots of g and the weights
of the representation r. the terms on the right hand side of (2.9) represent respec-
tively the classical prepotential, the one-loop perturbative corrections (higher loops do

not contribute in view of non-renormalization theorems), and the instanton corrections
f (d) = fd(2h
g i(r))d of all orders d. in general, it is prohibitively dicult to determine
the coecients fd from eld theory methods. for conformally invariant theories, the ex-
pansion (2.9) is replaced by a similar one where the dynamical scale  is replaced by a
modular invariant q = e2i (see e.g. (6.2) and (6.7) below).

as a result of the requirements (1) and (2), it follows immediately that f cannot be a
single-valued function of the aj. for if it were, im ij would be both harmonic and bounded
from below, which would imply that it must be independent of aj. but, from (3), we know

10

that ij is not constant at large aj. and indeed, from (3) again, it is clear that neither f
nor ij are single valued functions of the aj.

as is clear from the large aj behavior ij(a)  ln(ai  aj), one of the ways in which
ij(a) is multiple valued is by shifts of any of the matrix elements by an integer. this
ambiguity does not aect the physics of the low energy eective action (2.7), because
the constant shifts in re(ij) are like the shifts of the instanton angle  by 2 times an
integer and not observable. a more complicated multiple-valuedness consists in taking
   1, and corresponds to electric-magnetic duality, as shown by seiberg and witten
[1]. the combination of these two types of transformations produces the full duality group

sl(2n, z) of monodromies of  .

a natural setting in which the above monodromy problem may be solved is provided
by families of riemann surfaces, called the seiberg witten curves, denoted by . indeed,
letting the quantum moduli aj correspond to moduli of the riemann surfaces, there is
automatically a complex analytic period matrix, whose imaginary part is positive denite,
and whose monodromy group corresponds to the modular group of the surface. for g =
su (2) gauge group and no hypermultiplets for example, the seiberg-witten curve is a

of genus 1, and may be represented as a double sheeted cover of the complex plane,
(u) = {(x, y); y2 = (x  )(x + )(x  u)}. here u is an auxiliary parameter, which will
be related to the quantum modulus a, and  is the renormalization scale. we shall choose
the branch cut between the points x = . the quantum modulus and prepotential are
then given by

a(u) =

(x  u)

dx
y

ad(u) =

f (a)

a

=

2iib

(x  u)

dx

(2.10)

where the a-cycle may be chosen around the branch cut between  and the b-cycle
between the branch points + and u. as u  , the elliptic curve produces a singularity
which physically is interpreted as caused by the vanishing of the mass of a magnetic
monopole or dyon.

starting from the seiberg-witten solution for gauge group g = su (2), one may
abstract the general set-up of the seiberg-witten solution, expected for arbitrary gauge
algebra g with rank n and general hypermultiplet representation. the ingredients are

(1) the seiberg-witten curve is a family of riemann surfaces (u1,    , un) dependent on
n auxiliary complex parameters uj, which are related to the quantum moduli aj. the
seiberg-witten curve will also depend upon the gauge coupling g and -angle and on
the hypermultiplet masses mk.

11

(2) the seiberg-witten meromorphic dierential 1-form d on , whose residues are linear
in the hypermultiplet masses mk. since the hypermultiplet masses receive no quantum
corrections as aj varies, the derivatives (d)/aj are holomorphic 1-forms.

(3) the quantum moduli and the prepotential are given by

aj =

(2.11)

shortly after the initial work of seiberg and witten, the curves and dierentials for
general su (n ), with and without hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation were

proposed, as well as generalizations to the gauge groups so(n ) and sp(n ) [11]. see also
[12-14]. use was made of the r-charge assignments of the elds, the singularity structure
of the degenerations of the seiberg-witten curve, and much educated guess work.

iii. twisted and untwisted calogero-moser systems

arise in the limits 1 = i, 2   and 1, 2  . all these systems have been shown
to be completely integrable in the sense of liouville, i.e. they all admit a complete set of
integrals of motion which are in involution [15-17]. for a recent review of some applications

of these models see [18].

our considerations require however a notion of integrability which is in some sense
more stringent, namely the existence of a lax pair l(z), m (z) with spectral parameter z.

such a lax pair was obtained by krichever [19] in 1980. he showed that the hamiltonian
system (3.1) is equivalent to the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m (z)], with l(z) and m (z)
given by the following n  n matrices

lij(z) =piij  m(1  ij)(xi  xj, z)

mij(z) =mijxk6=i

(xi  xk)  m(1  ij)(xi  xj, z).

(3.2)

12

the function (x, z) is dened by

(x, z) =

(z  x)
(z)(x)

ex(z),

(3.3)

where (z), (z) are the usual weierstrass  and  functions on the torus c/(21z+22z).
the function (x, z) satises the key functional equation

(x, z)(y, z)  (y, z)(x, z) = ((x)  (y))(x + y, z).

(3.4)

it is well-known that functional equations of this form are required for the hamilton
equations of motion to be equivalent to the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m (z)] with a
lax pair of the form (3.2). often, solutions had been obtained under additional parity
assumptions in x (and y), which prevent the existence of a spectral parameter. the solution

(x, z) with spectral parameter z is obtained by dropping such parity assumptions for
general z. it is a relatively recent result of braden and buchstaber [20] that, conversely,

general functional equations of the form (3.4) essentially determine (x, z).

b) calogero-moser systems dened by lie algebras

as olshanetsky and perelomov [6] realized very early on, the hamiltonian system (3.1)
is only one example of a whole series of hamiltonian systems associated with each simple
lie algebra. more precisely, given any simple lie algebra g, olshanetsky and perelomov
[6] introduced the system with hamiltonian

h(x, p) =

1
2

r

xi=1

p2
i 

1

2 xr(g)

m2

||(  x),

(3.5)

where r is the rank of g, r(g) denotes the set of roots of g, and the m|| are mass
parameters. to preserve the invariance of the hamiltonian (3.5) under the weyl group,
the parameters m|| depend only on the orbit || of the root , and not on the root  itself.
in the case of an1 = su (n ), it is common practice to use n pairs of dynamical variables
(xi, pi), since the roots of an1 lie conveniently on a hyperplane in cn . the dynamics
of the system are unaected if we shift all xi by a constant, and the number of degrees
of freedom is eectively n  1 = r. now the roots of su (n ) are given by  = ei  ej,
1  i, j  n , i 6= j. thus we recognize the original elliptic calogero-moser system as the
special case of (3.5) corresponding to an1. as in the original case, the elliptic systems
(3.5) admit rational and trigonometric limits. olshanetsky and perelomov succeeded in

constructing a lax pair for all these systems in the case of classical lie algebras, albeit
without spectral parameter [6].

13

c) twisted calogero-moser systems dened by lie algebras

it turns out that the hamiltonian systems (3.5) are not the only natural extensions
of the basic elliptic calogero-moser system. a subtlety arises for simple lie algebras g
which are not simply-laced, i.e., algebras which admit roots of uneven length. this is the
case for the algebras bn, cn, g2, and f4 in cartans classication. for these algebras, the
following twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems were introduced by the authors in [7,8]

h twisted

g

=

1
2

r

xi=1

p2
i 

1

2 xr(g)

m2

||()(  x).

(3.6)

here the function () depends only on the length of the root . if g is simply-laced, we
set () = 1 identically. otherwise, for g non simply-laced, we set () = 1 when  is a
long root, () = 2 when  is a short root and g is one of the algebras bn, cn, or f4, and
() = 3 when  is a short root and g = g2. the twisted weierstrass function  (z) is
dened by

 (z) =

(z + 2a




),

1

x=0

(3.7)

where a is any of the half-periods 1, 2, or 1 + 2. thus the twisted and untwisted
calogero-moser systems coincide for g simply laced. the original motivation for twisted
calogero-moser systems was based on their scaling limits (which will be discussed in the
next section) [7,8]. another motivation based on the symmetries of dynkin diagrams was
proposed subsequently by bordner, sasaki, and takasaki [21].

iv. scaling limits of calogero-moser systems

a) results of inozemtsev for an1

for the standard elliptic calogero-moser systems corresponding to an1, inozemtsev

[22] has shown in the 1980s that in the scaling limit

m = m q 1

2n ,

q  0

xi = xi  22

i
n

, 1  i  n

(4.1)

(4.2)

where m is kept xed, the elliptic an1 calogero-moser hamiltonian tends to the following
hamiltonian

htoda =

n

xi=1

p2
i 

n1

xi=1

1

2(cid:0)

14

exi+1xi + ex1xn(cid:1)

(4.3)

the roots ei  ei+1, 1  i  n  1, and en  e1 can be recognized as the simple roots of
the ane algebra a(1)
n1. (for basic facts on ane algebras, we refer to [23]). thus (4.3)
can be recognized as the hamiltonian of the toda system dened by a(1)

n1.

b) scaling limits based on the coxeter number

the key feature of the above scaling limit is the collapse of the sum over the entire
root lattice of an1 in the calogero-moser hamiltonian to the sum over only simple roots
in the toda hamiltonian for the kac-moody algebra a(1)
n1. our task is to extend this
mechanism to general lie algebras. for this, we consider the following generalization of
the preceding scaling limit

2 ,

m = m q 1
x = x  22,

(4.4)

(4.5)

here x = (xi), x = (xi) and  are r-dimensional vectors. the vector x is the dynamical
variable of the calogero-moser system. the parameters  and  depend on the algebra
g and are yet to be chosen. as for m and x, they have the same interpretation as
earlier, namely as respectively the mass parameter and the dynamical variables of the
limiting system. setting 1 = i, the contribution of each root  to the calogero-moser
potential can be expressed as

m2(  x) =

1
2

m 2



xn=

e22

ch(  x  2n2)  1

(4.6)

it suces to consider positive roots . we shall also assume that 0       1. the
contributions of the n = 0 and n = 1 summands in (4.6) are proportional to e22( )
and e22(1+ ) respectively. thus the existence of a nite scaling limit requires that

       1  .

(4.7)

let i, 1  i  r be a basis of simple roots for g. if we want all simple roots i to survive
in the limit, we must require that

i   = 1, 1  i  r.

(4.8)

this condition characterizes the vector  as the level vector. next, the second condition
in (3.7) can be rewritten as {1 + max (  )}  1. but

hg = 1 + max (  )

(4.9)

15

is precisely the coxeter number of g, and we must have   1
, the
hg
contributions of all the roots except for the simple roots of g tend to 0. on the other hand,
when  = 1
, the highest root 0 realizing the maximum over  in (4.9) survives. since
hg
0 is the additional simple root for the ane lie algebra g(1), we arrive in this way at
the following theorem, which was proved in [8]

. thus when  < 1
hg

theorem 1. under the limit (4.4-4.5), with  = 1
, and  given by the level vector, the
hg
hamiltonian of the elliptic calogero-moser system for the simple lie algebra g tends to
the hamiltonian of the toda system for the ane lie algebra g(1).

(c) scaling limit based on the dual coxeter number

if the seiberg-witten spectral curve of the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with
a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation is to be realized as the spectral curve for a
calogero-moser system, the parameter m in the calogero-moser system should correspond
to the mass of the hypermultiplet. in the gauge theory, the dependence of the coupling

constant on the mass m is given by

 =

i
2

h
g ln

m2
m 2



m = m q

 1
2h
g

(4.10)

where h
g is the quadratic casimir of the lie algebra g. this shows that the correct
physical limit, expressing the decoupling of the hypermultiplet as it becomes innitely
massive, is given by (3.4), but with  = 1
. to establish a closer parallel with our preceding
h
g
discussion, we recall that the quadratic casimir h
g coincides with the dual coxeter number
of g, dened by

h
g = 1 + max (  ),

(4.11)

where  = 2
vector.

2 is the coroot associated to , and  = 1

2p>0  is the well-known weyl

for simply laced lie algebras g (ade algebras), we have hg = h

g , and the preceding
scaling limits apply. however, for non simply-laced algebras (bn, cn, g2, f4), we have
hg > h
g , and our earlier considerations show that the untwisted elliptic calogero-moser
hamiltonians do not tend to a nite limit under (3.10), q  0, m is kept xed. this is
why the twisted hamiltonian systems (3.6) have to be introduced. the twisting produces

precisely to an improvement in the asymptotic behavior of the potential which allows a
nite, non-trivial limit. more precisely, we can write

m2 (x) =

2
2



xn=

m2

ch (x  2n2)  1

16

.

(4.12)

setting x = x  22, we obtain the following asymptotics

m2 (x) = 2m 2(cid:26) e22()x + e22(1)+x ,

e22()x,

if  is long;
if  is short.

(4.13)

this leads to the following theorem [8]

g , with  the weyl vector and
theorem 2. under the limit x = x + 22
q  0, the hamiltonian of the twisted elliptic calogero-moser system for the simple lie
algebra g tends to the hamiltonian of the toda system for the ane lie algebra (g(1)).

so far we have discussed only the scaling limits of the hamiltonians. however, similar
arguments show that the lax pairs constructed below also have nite, non-trivial scaling

limits whenever this is the case for the hamiltonians. the spectral parameter z should
scale as ez = zq
2 , with z xed. the parameter z can be identied with the loop group
parameter for the resulting ane toda system.

v. lax pairs for calogero-moser systems

a) the general ansatz

let the rank of g be n, and d be its dimension. let  be a representation of g of
dimension n , of weights i , 1  i  n . let ui  cn be the weights of the fundamental
representation of gl(n, c). project orthogonally the ui s onto the i s as

sui = i + ui , i  vj .

it is easily veried that s2 is the second dynkin index. then

ij = i  j

(5.1)

(5.2)

is a weight of    associated to the root ui  uj of gl(n, c). the lax pairs for both
untwisted and twisted calogero-moser systems will be of the form

l = p + x, m = d + x,

(5.3)

where the matrices p, x, d, and y are given by

x = xi6=j

cij ij (ij , z)eij , y =xi6=j

cij 

ij (ij , z)eij

(5.4)

17

and by

p = p  h, d = d  (h  h) + .

(5.5)

here h is in a cartan subalgebra hg for g, h is in the cartan-killing orthogonal comple-
ment of hg inside a cartan subalgebra h for gl(n, c), and  is in the centralizer of hg
in gl(n, c). the functions ij (x, z) and the coecients cij are yet to be determined.
we begin by stating the necessary and sucient conditions for the pair l(z), m (z) of
(4.1) to be a lax pair for the (twisted or untwisted) calogero-moser systems. for this, it
is convenient to introduce the following notation

ij = ij (ij  x)
ij = ij (ij  x, z)


ji(ij  x, z)  ij (ij  x, z)

ji(ij  x, z).

(5.6)

then the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m (z)] implies the calogero-moser system if and

only if the following three identities are satised

xi6=j

cij cji 

ij ij = s2 xr(g)

cik ckj (ik 

kj  

xk6=i,j

(5.7)

(5.8)

ij ckj kj

cik ik kj

(5.9)

 xk6=i,j

the following theorem was established in [7]:

theorem 3. a representation , functions ij , and coecients cij with a spectral
parameter z satisfying (4.7-4.9) can be found for all twisted and untwisted elliptic calogero-
moser systems associated with a simple lie algebra g, except possibly in the case of twisted
g2. in the case of e8, we have to assume the existence of a 1 cocycle.

18

b) lax pairs for untwisted calogero-moser systems

we now describe some important features of the lax pairs we obtain in this manner.

 in the case of the untwisted calogero-moser systems, we can choose ij (x, z) =

(x, z), ij (x) = (x) for all g.

  = 0 for all g, except for e8.

 for an, the lax pair (3.2-3.3) corresponds to the choice of the fundamental repre-
sentation for . a dierent lax pair can be found by taking  to be the antisymmetric

representation.

 for the bcn system, the lax pair is obtained by imbedding bn in gl(n, c) with
n = 2n + 1. when z = a (half-period), the lax pair obtained this way reduces to the
lax pair obtained by olshanetsky and perelomov [6].

 for the bn and dn systems, additional lax pairs with spectral parameter can be

found by taking  to be the spinor representation.

 for g2, a rst lax pair with spectral parameter can be obtained by the above
construction with  chosen to be the 7 of g2. a second lax pair with spectral parameter
can be obtained by restricting the 8 of b3 to the 7  1 of g2.

 for f4, a lax pair can be obtained by taking  to be the 26  1 of f4, viewed as

the restriction of the 27 of e6 to its f4 subalgebra.

 for e6,  is the 27 representation.

 for e7,  is the 56 representation.

 for e8, a lax pair with spectral parameter can be constructed with  given by the

248 representation, if coecients cij = 1 exist with the following cocycle conditions

c(,   )c(  , ) =c(,  + )c( + , )

when    =    = 1,    = 0

c(, )c(  , ) =c(,   )

when    =    = 1,    = 0

c(, )c(,   ) =  c(  , )

when    = 1.

(5.10)

the matrix  in the lax pair is then the 8  8 matrix given by

19

m2

m2

b=1

ab = xa=1
 xa=1
aa = xa=1

b=1

2 (cid:0)c(a, )c(, b) + c(a, a  )c(a  , b)(cid:1)(  x)

2 (cid:0)c(a, )c(, b) + c(a, a  )c(a  , b)(cid:1)(  x)

m2(  x) + 2m2(a  x),

(5.11)

where a, 1  a  8, is a maximal set of 8 mutually orthogonal roots.

 explicit expressions for the constants cij and the functions d(x), and thus for the
lax pair are particularly simple when the representation  consists of only a single weyl

orbit of weights. this is the case when  is either
(1) the dening representation of an, cn or dn;
(2) any rank p totally anti-symmetric representation of an;
(3) an irreducible fundamental spinor representation of bn or dn;
(4) the 27 of e6; the 56 of e7.

the, the weights  and  of  provide unique labels instead of i and j, and the values

of cij = c are given by a simple formula

the expression for the vector d may be summarized by

2 m|| when  =    is a root

0

q 2

c =

sd  u = x=1; 2=2

otherwise

m||(  x)

(for cn, the last equation has an additional term, as given in [7].) in each case, the number
of independent couplings m|| equals the number of dierent root lengths.

c) lax pairs for twisted calogero-moser systems

recall that the twisted and untwisted calogero-moser systems dier only for non-
simply laced lie algebras, namely bn, cn, g2 and f4. these are the only algebras we
discuss in this paragraph. the construction (4.3-4.9) gives then lax pairs for all of them,
with the possible exception of twisted g2. unlike the case of untwisted lie algebras
however, the functions ij have to be chosen with care, and dier for each algebra. more
specically,

20

 for bn, the lax pair is of dimension n = 2n, admits two independent couplings m1

and m2, and

ij (x, z) =(cid:26) (x, z),

2( 1

2 x, z),

if i  j 6= 0, n
if i  j = n

.

here a new function 2(x, z) is dened by

2(

1
2

x, z) =

( 1

2 x, z)( 1

2 x + 1, z)

(1, z)

(5.12)

(5.13)

 for cn, the lax pair is of dimension n = 2n + 2, admits one independent coupling

m2, and

where ij are given by

ij (x, z) = 2(x + ij , z),

ij =( 0,

2,
2,

if i 6= j = 1, 2,    , 2n + 1;
if 1  i  2n, j = 2n + 2;
if 1  j  2n, i = 2n + 2.

(5.14)

 for f4, the lax pair is of dimension n = 24, two independent couplings m1 and

m2,

(x, z) =


(x, z),
1(x, z),
2( 1
2 x, z),

if    = 0;
if    = 1
2 ;
if    = 1.

(5.15)

where the function 1(x, z) is dened by

1(x, z) = (x, z)  ei(z)+1z(x + 1, z)

(5.16)

here it is more convenient to label the entries of the lax pair directly by the weights
 = i and  = j instead of i and j.

 for g2, candidate lax pairs can be dened in the 6 and 8 representations of g2,
but it is still unknown whether elliptic functions ij (x, z) exist which satisfy the required
identities.

we note that recently lax pairs of root type have been considered [21] which cor-
respond, in the above ansatz (5.3-5), to  equal to the adjoint representation of g and
the coecients cij vanishing for i or j associated with zero weights. this choice yields
another lax pair for the case of e8.

21

vi. calogero-moser and seiberg-witten theory for su(n)

the correspondence between seiberg-witten theory for n = 2 super-yang-mills the-
ory with one hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge algebra, and the el-
liptic calogero-moser systems was rst established in [5], for the gauge algebra g = su (n ).
we describe it here in some detail.

all that we shall need here of the elliptic calogero-moser system is its lax operator

l(z), whose n  n matrix elements are given by

lij(z) = piij  m(1  ij)(xi  xj, z)

(6.1)

notice that the hamiltonian is simply given in terms of l by h(x, p) = 1
with c =  1

2 m2n (n  1).

2 trl(z)2 + c(z)

a) correspondence of data

the correspondence between the data of the elliptic calogero-moser system and those

of the seiberg-witten theory is as follows.
(1) the parameter m in (6.1) is the hypermultiplet mass;

(2) the gauge coupling g and the -angle are related to the modulus of the torus  =

c/(21z + 22z) by

 =

2
1

=


2

+

4i
g2 ;

(6.2)

(3) the seiberg-witten curve  is the spectral curve of the elliptic calogero-moser model,

dened by

 = {(k, z)  c  , det(cid:0)ki  l(z)(cid:1) = 0}

(6.3)

and the seiberg-witten 1-form is d = k dz.  is invariant under the weyl group of
su (n ).

(4) using the lax equation l = [l, m ], it is clear that the spectral curve is independent
of time, and can be dependent only upon the constants of motion of the calogero-
moser system, of which there are only n . these integrals of motion may be viewed

as parametrized by the quantum moduli of the seiberg-witten system.

(5) finally, d = kdz is meromorphic, with a simple pole on each of the n sheets above

the point z = 0 on the base torus. the residue at each of these poles is proportional
to m, as required by the general set-up of seiberg-witten theory, explained in ii.

22

b) four fundamental theorems

while the above mappings of the seiberg-witten data onto the calogero-moser data is
certainly natural, there is no direct proof of it, and it is important to check that the results

inferred from it agree with known facts from quantum eld theory. to establish this, as
well as a series of further predictions from the correspondence, we give four theorems (the

proofs may be found in [5] for the rst three theorems, and in [24] for the last one).

theorem 4. the spectral curve equation det(ki  l(z)) = 0 is equivalent to

1(cid:18) 1

21

(z  m


k

)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:19)h(k) = 0

(6.4)

where h(k) is a monic polynomial in k of degree n , whose zeros (or equivalently whose

coecients) correspond to the moduli of the gauge theory. if h(k) =qn

i=1(k  ki), then

here, 1 is the jacobi -function, which admits a simple series expansion in powers
of the instanton factor q = e2i , so that the curve equation may also be rewritten as a
series expansion

2 n(n1)enzh(k  n  m) = 0

(6.5)

()nq

xnz

where we have set 1 = i without loss of generality. the series expansion (6.5) is
superconvergent and sparse in the sense that it receives contributions only at integers that
grow like n2.

theorem 5. the prepotential of the seiberg-witten theory obeys a renormalization group-
type equation that simply relates f to the calogero-moser hamiltonian, expressed in terms
of the quantum order parameters aj

aj =

trl(z)2 + c(z)

(6.6)

furthermore, in an expansion in powers of the instanton factor q = e2i , the quantum
order parameters aj may be computed by residue methods in terms of the zeros of h(k).

the proof of (6.6) requires riemann surface deformation theory [5]. the fact that the
quantum order parameters may be evaluated by residue methods arises from the fact that

23

aj-cycles may be chosen on the spectral curve  in such a way that they will shrink to
zero as q  0. as a result, contour integrals around full-edged branch cuts aj reduce
to contour integrals around poles at single points, which may be calculated by residue
methods only. these methods were originally developed in [25,26]. knowing the quantum
order parameters in terms of the zeros kj of h(k) = 0 is a relation that may be inverted
and used in (6.6) to obtain a dierential relation for all order instanton corrections. it is
now only necessary to evaluate explicitly the  -independent contribution to f , which in
eld theory arises from perturbation theory. this may be done easily by retaining only the
n = 0 and n = 1 terms in the expansion of the curve (6.5), so that z = ln h(k)ln h(km).
the results of the calculations to two instanton order may be summarized in the following
theorem [5].

theorem 6. the prepotential, to 2 instanton order is given by f = f (pert) + f (1) + f (2).
the perturbative contribution is given by

f (pert) =

the perturbative corrections to the prepotential of (6.7a) indeed precisely agree with
the predictions of asymptotic freedom. the formulas (6.7c) for the instanton corrections
f (1) and f (2) are new, as they have not yet been computed by direct eld theory methods.
perturbative expansions of the prepotential in powers of m have also been obtained in [27].

the moduli ki, 1  i  n , of the gauge theory are evidently integrals of motion of the
system. to identify these integrals of motion, denote by s be any subset of {1,    , n },
and let s = {1,    , n } \ s, (s) = (xi  xj) when s = {i, j}. let also ps denote the
subset of momenta pi with i  s. we have [24]

c) partial decoupling of the hypermultiplet and product gauge groups

the spectral curves of certain gauge theories can be easily derived from the calogero-

moser curves by a partial decoupling of the hypermultiplet. indeed,

 the masses of the gauge multiplet and hypermultiplet are |ai  aj| and |ai  aj + m|.
in suitable limits, some of these masses become , and states with innite mass decouple.
the remaining gauge group is a subgroup of su (n ).

 when the eective coupling of a gauge subgroup is 0, the dynamics freeze and the

gauge states become non-interacting.

non-trivial decoupling limits arise when    and m  . when all ai are
nite, we obtain the pure yang-mills theory. when some hypermultiplets masses remain
nite, the u (1) factors freeze, the gauge group su (n ) is broken down to su (n1)     
su (np), and the remaining hypermultiplets are in e.g.
fundamental or bifundamental
representations. for example, let n = 2n1 be even, and set

ki = v1 + xi, kn1+j = v2 + yj, 1  i, j  n1,

with pn1

i=1 xi = pn1

j=1 yj = 0. (the term v = v1  v2 is associated to the u (1) factor of

the prepotential of the su (n1)  su (n1) theory can be also read o the calogero-

vii. calogero-moser and seiberg-witten theory

for general g

we consider now the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory for a general simple gauge

algebra g and a hypermultiplet of mass m in the adjoint representation. then [9]

 the seiberg-witten curve of the theory is given by the spectral curve  = {(k, z) 
c  ; det(ki  l(z)) = 0} of the twisted elliptic calogero-moser system associated to the
lie algebra g. the seiberg-witten dierential d is given by d = kdz.

 the function r(k, z) = det(ki  l(z)) is polynomial in k and meromorphic in z.
the spectral curve  is invariant under the weyl group of g. it depends on n complex
moduli, which can be thought of as independent integrals of motion of the calogero-moser
system.

 the dierential d = kdz is meromorphic on , with simple poles. the position
and residues of the poles are independent of the moduli. the residues are linear in the

hypermultiplet mass m.
determine for general g).

(unlike the case of su (n ), their exact values are dicult to

 in the m  0 limit, the calogero-moser system reduces to a free system, the spectral
curve  is just the producr of several unglued copies of the base torus , indexed by the
constant eigenvalues of l(z) = p  h. let ki, 1  i  n, be n independent eigenvalues, and
ai, bi be the a and b cycles lifted to the corresponding sheets. for each i, we readily
obtain

thus the prepotential f is given by f = 
i . this is the classical prepotential
and hence the correct answer, since in the m  0 limit, the theory acquires an n = 4
supersymmetry, and receives no quantum corrections.

 the m   limit is the crucial consistency check, which motivated the introduction
of the twisted calogero-moser systems in the rst place [7,8]. in view of theorem 2 and

subsequent comments, in the limit m  , q  0, with x = x + 22
with x and m kept xed, the hamiltonian and spectral curve for the twisted elliptic
calogero-moser system with lie algebra g reduce to the hamiltonian and spectral curve
for the toda system for the ane lie algebra (g(1)). this is the correct answer. indeed,
in this limit, the gauge theory with adjoint hypermultiplet reduces to the pure yang-mills
theory, and the seiberg-witten spectral curves for pure yang-mills with gauge algebra g
have been shown by martinec and warner [31] to be the spectral curves of the toda system
for (g(1)).

 the eective prepotential can be evaluated explicitly in the case of g = dn for
n  5. its logarithmic singularity does reproduce the logarighmic singularities expected
from eld theory considerations.

 as in the known correspondences between seiberg-witten theory and integrable

models [5,25], we expect the following equation to hold

f

(x, p),

(6.11)

to hold. note that the left hand side can be interpreted in the gauge theory as a renor-
malization group equation.

 for simple laced g, the curves r(k, z) = 0 are modular invariant. physically, the
gauge theories for these lie algebras are self-dual. for non simply-laced g, the modular
group is broken to the congruence subgroup 0(2) for g = bn, cn, f4, and to 0(3) for
g2. the hamiltonians of the twisted calogero-moser systems for non-simply laced g
are also transformed under landen transformations into the hamiltonians of the twisted
calogero-moser system for the dual algebra g.
it would be interesting to determine
whether such transformations exist for the spectral curves or the corresponding gauge

theories themselves.

spectral curves for certain gauge theories with classical gauge algebras and matter in

the adjoint representation have also been proposed in [32] and [33], based on branes and
m-theory. relations with integrable systems were discussed in [34].
