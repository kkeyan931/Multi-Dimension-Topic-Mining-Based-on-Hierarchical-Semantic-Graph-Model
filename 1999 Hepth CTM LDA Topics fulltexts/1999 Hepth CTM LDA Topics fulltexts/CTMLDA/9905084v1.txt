abstract

we calculate the energy of a yangmills vortex as function of its magnetic ux or, else,
of the wilson loop surrounding the vortex center. the calculation is performed in the
1-loop approximation. a parallel with a potential as function of the polyakov line at
nonzero temperatures is drawn. we nd that quantized z(2) vortices are dynamically
preferred though vortices with arbitrary uxes cannot be ruled out.

the hypothesis that z(nc) vortices are responsible for connement has several attractive
features. first, one immediately gets the area law for wilson loops in the fundamental
representation of the su(nc) gauge group, even under the simplest assumption that vortices
are non-interacting and therefore the number of vortices piercing a given loop is poisson-
distributed [1]. furthermore, wilson loops in any representation transforming under the
group center z(nc) will have the same string tension as in the fundamental representation,
while the center-blind representations will have, asymptotically, zero string tension. this
is what is expected from screening by gluons. the temporal approximate casimir scaling of
the string tensions may be probably explained by the nite sizes of the vortex cores [2].

second, heating the d = 3 + 1 yangmills system towards the high-temperature d = 3
case and then heating d = 2 + 1 system eventually to the d = 2 case, one does not observe
abrupt changes in the spatial string tensions. this continuity as one goes from four to two
dimensions favours d = 2 objects as being basic for connement in all the above cases 1. in
three dimensions vortices form closed lines; in four dimensions they form closed surfaces.

1in d = 2 pure yangmills theory the connement is trivial in axial gauges and may seem to have no
relation to vortices. however, it is known that at least on compact d = 2 manifolds the theory is exactly
equivalent to a sum over vortices, see a recent paper [4] and references therein.

for vortices to be physical objects and not artifacts of a regularization, their cores should
be nite in physical units, i.e. to be of the order of 1/  m 1 exp(3  82/11ncg2) in d = 4
and of the order of 1/g2
3 in d = 3. correspondingly, the energy of a vortex per unit length
should be of the order of g2
3 in d = 3, and the energy per unit surface should be of the order
of 2 in d = 4. first indications that in might indeed be the case came recently from lattice
studies using the smoothing procedure [3].

in order to reveal thick vortices theoretically, one has rst of all to integrate out the
high-momentum components of the yangmills eld. the resulting eective action may then
have a stable saddle point of a vortex type, with the core size remaining nite as one takes
the uv cuto to innity. when and if it happens, one can speak of vortices as physical
entities, and further on to try to build a theory of those extended objects in the vacuum.

() = naa

the main dynamical variable of a vortex is the azimuthal component of the yangmills
eld aa
, where n is a unit vector in the plane transverse to the vortex.
one can always choose a gauge where a is independent of the azimuth angle . generally
speaking, it implies that the radial component a() 6= 0, however, we shall neglect this
component as it can be always reconstructed from gauge invariance by replacing  
ab + f acbac
. a circle wilson loop lying in the transverse plane and surrounding the
vortex center is then

arbitrary representation of su(2), labelled by spin j, one has

if ()  integer at large distances  from the vortex core, the wilson loop wj ()  (1)2j .
this is the denition of the z(2) vortex. we shall see that integer values of () are
dynamically preferred.

to get the eective action for () we integrate over quantum uctuations about a given
background eld aa

kmin. accordingly, quantum uctuations have momenta from kmin up to the uv cuto kmax.
writing a = a + a where a = aa

the eective action may be expanded in powers of the (covariant) derivatives of the
background eld a. we are now interested in the rst nontrivial term of this expansion,
namely in the zero-derivative term, that is in the eective potential as function of the ux
a. the next term with two derivatives will renormalize eq. (3), and there will be, generally
in the zero-derivative order f( a) = 0, therefore det(w) =
speaking, further terms.

where we have introduced the vortex potential energy in d dimensions v (d)(). here sp
denotes the functional and the colour traces, and integration over the proper time s has
been introduced. the limits smin  1/k2
min are gauge-invariant uv and
ir cutos, respectively. in saturating the functional trace one can use any complete set of
functions. naturally, one uses the plane wave basis for the longitudinal components x3...xd,
and the polar basis exp(im)fk,m() for the transverse ones, where the functions fk,m()
must form a complete set, see below.
in what follows we shall consider only the su(2)
case. the transverse part of the covariant laplacian (8), after acting on the polar harmonics
exp(im), m = integer, has three eigenvalues as a 3  3 colour matrix:

max and smax  1/k2

the rst one cancels out when one subtracts the free determinant (without the external
eld); the last two are actually coinciding, given that m ranges from minus to plus innity.
the dierential operator (eq. (10), last line) has eigenfunctions j(m)(k) with eigenvalues

k2. the index of bessel functions must be non-negative to ensure regularity at the origin.
we thus choose the functions fm,k(, ) = exp(im)j|m|(k) as a complete functional basis

(12)

eqs.(11, 12) can be checked using the formula 6.541.1 from gradshteyn and rhyzhik [5].
eq. (9) can be thus rewritten as

we see that the dependence on the ux  enters only through the indices of the bessel
functions and that the potential is explicitly periodic in  with period 1. integration over
momenta can be easily performed using eq. 6.633.2 from [5], yielding

where we have introduced a new variable t = 2/(2s) instead of s. correspondingly, the

the above expression is nite in the limit when one removes both the uv cuto (tmax  )
and the ir cuto (tmin  0). in this limit both integrations in (15) become elementary, and

figure 1: the vortex potential, eq. (16).

at d = 2 the vortex potential is identically zero as there are no transverse gluons in two
dimensions. though the potential is given just by a polynomial (in case d = 4), it is actually
a periodic function of  with a unit period, as seen explicitly from eq. (13). at integer  the
potential is zero but has a jump in the rst derivative; it is depicted in fig.1.

the problem we have solved has certain similarity with that of the potential energy as
function of the d-th component of the yangmills eld aa
=d, in case of nonzero temperatures.
in that problem one integrates over all matsubara frequences in the background of a static
aa
d, where d = 4 for 3 + 1 dimensions, and d = 3 for 2 + 1 dimensions. the two problems
are ideologically similar, only the topology is dierent: in the nonzero-temperature case the
topology is that of a cylinder s(1)  r(d1), with the compact dimension in the temperature
direction, while in the problem considered here the topology is that of a plane with a deleted
point at the origin, r(2) \ {0}  r(d2). the role of matsubara frequencies is played by
the polar harmonics exp(im). in the rst case one nds the potential energy as function
of the polyakov line winding in the compact dimension; in the second case one nds the
potential energy as function of the wilson loop winding around the point at the origin. in
both cases the potential energy is a periodic function, however the calculations are easier in
the nonzero-temperature case as one can evaluate the functional trace (9) in the plane-wave
basis. a simple calculation of eq. (9) gives the following form of the nonzero-temperature

potential energy as function of  = qaa

(19)

it is worth mentioning that for d = 3 the debye mass is infrared-divergent, hence the
non-analiticity in the 2 term. in the case of the vortex potential (16) the infrared divergency
is even stronger: as a result the expansion of the potential starts from the non-analytic ||
term both for d = 3 and 4. it is interesting that in all cases above the non-analytic terms are
due to the contribution of zero matsubara frequencies (in case of the vortex zero frequency
means the azimuthal harmonic with m = 0). indeed, the contributions of zero frequencies
to the temperature potentials (18) and (19) are

v (4)
=0() = 

(2t )4
122 23 + uv divergence,

v (3)
=0() = t 32 ln

1
2 + uv divergence.
(20)

the m = 0 contribution to the vortex potential (16) is

v (4)
m=0() =

1
4

1
122 (  3) + uv divergence.

(21)

these are exactly the non-analytic terms in all the cases. the uv divergences are cancelled
by contributions from nonzero frequencies.

if there are dynamical fermions in the problem, they should be treated dierently in the
nonzero-temperature case and in the vortex one. in the rst case fermions are antiperiodic in
the temperature direction, hence one has to sum over half-integer matsubara frequencies.
in the latter case fermion wave functions are periodic functions of the azimuthal angle . the
resulting fermion contribution to the vortex potential (in the fundamental representation)
is obtained from eq. (16) by substituting   /2 and multiplying the result by 2. the
fermion contribution is periodic in  with period 2, and not 1 as in the boson case. it can
be easily checked that in the supersymmetric case, with majorana gluinos belonging to the
adjoint representation, the fermion contribution cancels exactly with the boson one, so that
the vortex potential is zero.

6

returning to the bosonic contribution to the eective vortex potential (16) in the pure
glue case, one concludes that integer values of () are a must at   0, otherwise the
integral over ,

potential energy = 2z 

0

d  v (d)(),

(22)

diverges. integer values of () at    are, clearly, energetically favourable though the
energy (22) remains nite at noninteger values of () as well because of the convergence of
the integration over  at large . it means that the quantized z(2) vortices are dynamically
preferred but noninteger uxes are not altogether ruled out by the energetics. this should
be contrasted to the case of nonzero temperatures where quantized values of ad at spatial
innity are necessary to make the energy nite.
