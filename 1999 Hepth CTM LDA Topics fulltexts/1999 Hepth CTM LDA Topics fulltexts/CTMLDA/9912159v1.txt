abstract

the s-duality transformations in type iib string theory can be seen as local u (1) trans-
formations in type iib supergravity. we use this approach to construct the sl(2, z)
multiplets associated to supersymmetric backgrounds of type iib string theory and the
transformation laws of their corresponding killing spinors.

1. introduction

the low energy limit of type iib superstring theory is type iib supergravity [1,2].
among the symmetries of type iib string theory, s-duality is peculiar and has concentrated
a lot of work since its discovery [3], since it is a non-perturbative (conjectured quantum
exact) symmetry relating the strong and weak coupling regimes of string theory. this
s-duality symmetry is encoded, classically, in a sl(2, r) group, which is broken in the
quantum theory to sl(2, z). the existence of this symmetry ensures that any solution of
type iib string theory belongs to a sl(2, z) multiplet.

the sl(2, z) multiplets to which the fundamental string and the solitonic ve branes
belong have been identied in [4] and [5] respectively. in this paper we will study a more
general case. our expressions will apply for any solution of the type iib string eective
equations of motion whith at least one non vanishing electric or magnetic charge with
respect to the three forms (or their duals) appearing in the theory. we identify the sl(2, z)
multiplet to which a given type iib string solution of this type belongs. we will also study
the behaviour of the killing spinors associated to supersymmetric solutions under s-duality
transformations. this is particularly interesting when studying the world-volume theories
of extended objects in iib backgrounds, since it allows to write the conditions for bps
solutions coming from kappa symmetry.

this paper is organized as follows. first we review quickly the aspects of type iib
supergravity and type iib superstring theory that will be used through the paper, to x our
conventions. the equations of motion of type iib supergravity are invariant under a local
u (1) transformation. second, we introduce a map relating the equations of motion of type
iib supergravity and type iib superstring theory and recognize the local u (1) invariance
of type iib supergravity as s-duality transformations of type iib string theory. this allows
one to identify the sl(2, z) multiplets associated to a given solution of type iib string
theory, and provide us automatically with the transformation law of the killing spinors
of the theory under s-duality. then we work out explicitly the cases of magnetically and
electrically charged sl(2, z) multiplets, checking our general expressions with examples
previously constructed in the literature. in the last section we present our conclusions and
discussion.

2. quick review of type iib supergravity and the type iib string.

the equations of motion for ten dimensional chiral n = 2 supergravity have been

known for a long time ([1,2]). they are given by (for the bosonic part of the theory):

dp = 
dg = p g

gg

r = pp

kk 



(2.1)

where d stands for the covariant derivative with respect to the u (1) gauge eld q present
in type iib supergravity (d =   iqq, with q = 2, 1 for p and g respectively)
and  denotes hodge duality.
these equations have well known invariances. one of them (easy to check from (2.1))
is the local u (1) transformation:

p  p  = e2i(x)p
g  g = ei(x)g
q  q = q + d
k  k  = k
g  g

 = g

(2.2)

we could consider solutions to the equations (2.1) with excitations of the ve form
k. but, as we can see in (2.2), these excitations are neutral under u (1) transformations
and, for this reason, will not enter in the discussions below. we set this ve form to zero
from now on.

a second symmetry of the equations (2.1) are chiral n = 2 supersymmetryc tranfor-
mations. in particular, the dilatino and gravitino transformations under supersym-
metry are given by:

 = ip 
1
 = d +

(2.3)



in the equation above,  and  are complex weyl spinors of opposite chirality, 11 =
, 11 = . the supersymmetry parameters  form also a complex weyl spinor
satisfying 11 = . notice that these supersymmetric transformations are covariant
under the local u (1) transformations of (2.2) (the charges of ,  and  being 3/2,
1/2 and 1/2 respectively). in particular, bps states will remain bps after a local u (1)
transformation.

the bosonic sector of the low energy limit of type iib string theory is described by

the action (when the ve form is turned o and in the einstein frame)

siib =

4 z d10xg[r

(eh (1)2 + ef 2)]

(2.4)

where  = l2

s is the string tension and we have dened

h (1) = db,
f = h (2)  h (1) = dc  db

(2.5)

(being b and c the ns-ns and r-r 2-form potentials respectively).

3. iib string s-duality as local u (1) iib supergravity transformations.

the equations of motion of type iib supergravity (2.1) exactly map to the equations of
motion derived from the iib superstring action (2.4) if we make the following identications
between the string and supergravity elds (we use the language of forms):

p =

(d + ied)

1
2
1
q = 
2
g = e 1
2 h (1) + ie

ed

1

2 f.

(3.1)

this map corresponds to a particular parametrization and gauge choice for the supergravity
scalar elds and was also obtained in [6]. it can be partially inverted to obtain:

d = 2(p + iq)
d = 2qe
h (1) = e
2 reg
h (2) = e 1

1

2 img + e

(3.2)

1

2 reg,

where reg and img denote the real and imaginary parts of g. the action (2.4) can then
be written as:

siib = z d10xg[r  2kpk2 

1
12kgk2],

(3.3)

where the u (1) invariance (2.2) is obvious.

now, using (2.2) it is straightforward to obtain from (3.2) the local u (1) transforma-
tion laws of d, d, h (1) and h (2). if we demand d to be a real eld, this imposses
an additional condition on the allowed local u (1) transformations. (x) has to satisfy the
equation:

d(x) =  sin((x)) cos((x))d + sin2((x))ed,

whose solution is:

(x) =  arctan(

ke(x)
1 + k(x)

),

(3.4)

(3.5)

being k a constant of integration.

under local u (1) transformations with this (x), one gets from (3.2) the transforma-

tion laws of d and d:

d = cos(2(x))d  sin(2(x))ed
d = sin(2(x))d + cos(2(x))ed.

e

(3.6)

3

these equations can be easily integrated and one obtains:

e

= e[c2(2 + e2) + 2cd + d2]

 =

ac(2 + e2) + (ad + bc) + bd

[c2(2 + e2) + 2cd + d2]

(3.7)

now, from (3.2) one can also compute the transformation laws for h (1) and h (2).

one gets:

h (1)
h (2)

= dh (1) + ch (2)

= bh (1) + ah (2).

(3.8)

note that (3.7) and (3.8) are nothing but the usual s-duality transformations of type iib
superstring theory realized as u (1) local transformations in type iib supergravity. to
make contact with the usual sl(2, r) language of s-duality we have just redened the two
integration constants coming from (3.6) together with k in (3.5) into the four constants a,
b, c and d plus the sl(2, r) constraint ad  bc = 1. after this redenition, k = c/d and
the local u (1) gauge transformation function (x) can be determined through its sine and
cosine :

sin (x) = 

ce

p(d + c)2 + c2e2

,

cos (x) =

d + c

p(d + c)2 + c2e2

.

(3.9)

this automatically gives the transformation law of the killing spinors under s-duality

transformations. the killing spinors  have 1

2 u (1) charge, therefore:

(x) = e

i

2 (x)(x),

(3.10)

with (x) given in (3.9)3.

the transformation of the killing spinors can be understood (formally) as a parallel
transport using the u (1) connections q and q as follows. let us take a ten dimensional
space-time point x0 which is a xed point of the local u (1) transformation (i.e., (x0) = 0).
then, from (2.2), we have that

(x) = z x

x0

d = z x

x0

(q  q) = z x

x0

q +z x0

x

q.

(3.11)

as a result (see (3.10)), the eect of a s-duality transformation on a spinor can be under-
stood as a parallel transport of the spinor (x) from any point x of space-time to a xed
point x0 of the u (1) transformation with the q connection, and then parallel transport
the resulting spinor back to the initial point x with the gauge connection q. if we perform
a sl(2, r) transformation with c = 0, any point in space-time is a xed u (1) point. we
can then take x0 = x in (3.11) and the killing spinor remains invariant.

3 similar expressions were derived in [7,8] for specic cases.

4

there can be also xed u (1) points where  = . these points are singular and
the classical solutions to the eective string equations are not reliable (there are strong
quantum gravity stringy corrections in a neighborhood of these points of size  ls). so
the parallel transport (3.11) starts from a point where the classical solution of the eective
string action is reliable, goes to a singular point, where quantum gravity eects take place,
and comes back to the initial point where the classical solution of the eective string action
is reliable again (note that (x) is well dened all along the path). in this way the s-duality
transformations capture non-perturbative information from the supergravity point of view.

4. magnetic multiplets.

given any solution of the equations of motion g , , , b and c, all the members of
the sl(2, z) multiplet associated to it can be obtained from (3.7) and (3.8) once the right
parameters a, b, c and d connecting them are correctly identied. this is what we will be
doing in this (next) section, distinguishing the cases in which at least one of the magnetic
(electric) charges are non-vanishing.

let us rst consider the simplest case in which there is at least one non-vanishing
magnetic charge in the solution to the equations of motion. let us dene the magnetic
charges in the following way:

qi = z h (i),

pi = z h (i)

,

(4.1)

where the integration is performed over a region that surrounds the world-volume of the
charged object. one can use the four equations (3.7) and (3.8) to obtain the three inde-
pendent values of the constants a, c and d (b is obtained from ad  bc = 1) in terms of
those charges and the values 0, 0, 
0 of the elds , ,  and  evaluated at
some point (which is usually taken at innity). the result is the following:

0 and 

a =

b =

being  the constant:

[q1

2(e

0 

0 + e0 0)  e0 (p1p2 + q1q2)]
0 + e0 0) + (e0 q2

0

2  e

0 p2

[(p1p2  q1q2)(e
2e0 )
(q1

0  p1

[p1

2(e

0 (p1p2 + q1q2)],

  q1p1(e

0 

0 + e0 0)  (q1p2e

0 + q2p1e0 ).

(4.2)

(4.3)

note that, since we are assuming that q1 and/or q2 do not vanish, the constants (4.2) are
generically well dened. it is clear from (4.2) that quantization conditions on the charges
q1, q2, p1, p2 break sl(2, r) down to sl(2, z) [9] (for xed asympotic values of the scalar
elds).equation (4.2) provides the sl(2, z) parameters relating any two components of

5

the multiplet. since we started from four equations ((3.7) and (3.8)) and three unknowns
(a, c and d), we also get a constraint equation that qi, pi, , ,  and  have to satisfy:

e(q2  q1)2 + eq1

2 = e

(p2  p1)2 + e

p1

2.

(4.4)

the interpretation of this constraint will be clear in what follows. the killing spinors are
straightforwardly computed by using the equations (3.10), (3.9) and (4.2).

lets us work out a specic example. we will take a bps ns5-brane in the einstein

frame:

ds2

e = h(r) 1
e = ph(r),

4 (dt2 + dx 2

k ) + h(r)

h (1) = 2r23,

being h(r) the harmonic function:

h(r) = 1 +

r2
r2 ,

3

4 (dr2 + r2d3)
h (2) =  = 0,

(4.5)

(4.6)

and construct the sl(2, z) multiplet to which it belongs, and the corresponding killing
spinors (this multiplet was rst constructed in [5]).

we will take, moreover, the asymptotic conditions, 

0  () and 
that in (4.6) we have already taken 0  () = 0 and 0  () = 0).

from equation (4.4) we obtain, for this case:

0  () (note

2 = e

q1

0 (p2  p1

0)2 + e

0 p1

2

(4.7)

which allows to eliminate q1 in equations (4.2) and write them in terms of p1 and p2 alone.
this gives:

(4.8)

(4.9)

a =

b =

c =

d =

1
q1
p2
q1
1
q1
p1
q1

[e

0

0(p1

0  p2) + p1e
0 ]

e

0 (p1

0  p2)

.

just plugging this result on (3.7) and (3.8) we get the sl(2, z) multiplet:

e

= c2h(r) 1

2 + d2h(r)

1
2

 =

ac + bdh(r)
c2 + d2h(r)

h (1)
h (2)

= dh (1)

= bh (1).

6

the einstein metric is inert under the u (1) transformations (see equation (2.2)),
meaning that the mass measured with it is equal for all the members of the multiplet.
the coecient r of the harmonic form is then invariant. using (4.7), it can be written in
terms of the charges p1, p2:

q1 = z h (1) = 2r2w3  r2

(p1,p2)  r2 = qe

0 (p2  p1
2w3

0)2 + e

0 p1

2

,

(4.10)

where we denoted by w3 the volume of the unit s3. usually, the charges are given in
units in which q1 = 1. the ns5-brane and the d5-brane are then just the (1, 0) and (0, 1)
elements of this multiplet of (p1, p2) magnetic 5-branes.

let us compute the killing spinors. in the present case, the function  depends only

on r and can be written in terms of the charges p1 and p2 from the equations (4.8) as:

sin (p1,p2)(r) = 

cos (p1,p2)(r) =

e

0 (p1
0  p2)
0  p2)2 + p2

qe2

0 (p1

1h(r)

1
2

p1[h(r)]
0  p2)2 + p2

.

1h(r)

qe2

0 (p1

(4.11)

now, using equation (3.10), the killing spinor of the (p1, p2) magnetic 5-brane can be
obtained from that of the ns5-brane as:

(p1,p2) = e

i

2 (p1,p2 )(r) n s5,

where

n s5 = [h(r)] 1

16 e 3

2 3 r e 2

2 23 e 1

2 1 2 0

being 0 a constant complex weyl spinor of negative chirality satisfying:

0123450 = 
0.

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

in eq.
(4.13) the s with underlined indices represent at (constant) ten dimensional
dirac gamma matrices and 1, 2, 3 are the angular coordinates of the transverse 3-sphere.
notice that the angular dependent part in (4.13) is just the killing spinor of s3 ([10]).

we have already seen that the adm masses, computed with the einstein metric, are
equal for all members of the multiplet. however, if we want to visualize the kind of objects
that belong to the multiplets from the string theory point of view (i.e., the dependence of
the masses on the string coupling constant), we have to compute the adm masses with
the modied einstein metric g [11]. this metric is related to the einstein metric by:

g  gsg = e


0
2 g .

(4.15)

the modied einstein metric is dened such that it coincides with the string metric asym-
totically. it is clear from (4.15) that the masses of the members of the multiplet, measured

7

with g, are dierent (due to the change of the string coupling contant under sl(2, z)
transformations). if we write the action (2.4) in terms of the modied einstein metric, the
s 4. the adm mass is now computed from
newton constant gn gets rescaled to gn = g2
the behaviour of g00 at innity [12]:

g00  1 +

gn
3w3

m
r2 .

(4.16)

in our case, after writing the modied einstein metric associated to the metric in equation
(4.5), we get:

g00  1 +

1
4

gsr2

p

r2

(4.17)

(4.18)

comparing (4.16) and (4.17), and using the equation (4.10), we arrive at:

m =

3

84qg2

s (p2  p1

0)2 + g4

s p2
1.

note that this adm mass has units of mass per unit of brane volume (1/(lenght6)), so
it corresponds to the tensions of the (p1, p2) ve branes. note also that the p1 charged
objects contribute to the mass with terms of order p1/g2
s (as corresponds to the magnetic
ns ve brane) whereas the p2 charged objects contribute to the mass with a term of
order p2/gs (as corresponds to d-branes solitons). then, (4.9) describes the background
congurations corresponding to bound states of solitonic 5-branes and d5-branes [13].

5. the electric multiplets.

let us now consider the cases in which there is at least one non-vanishing electric
charge. in the electric case, the conserved charges are given by the equations of motion
for the ns-ns and r-r potentials b and c:

where we have dened

d  s(1) = d  s(2) = 0,

s(1)  eh (1)  ef
s(2)  ef.

then, we dene the electric charges as:

qi = z s(i),

pi = z s(i)

,

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

where the integration region surrounds the charged object.

from the equations (3.7) and (3.8) we can work out the transformations laws for s(1)

and s(2) under local u (1) transformations. the result is the following:

s(1)
s(2)

= as(1)  bs(2)
= cs(1) + ds(2),

8

(5.4)

i.e., using (5.3):

p1 = aq1  bq2
p2 = cq1 + dq2.

(5.5)

note that, compared with (3.8), if the magnetic charges transforms with the sl(2, z)
matrix k, then the electric charges transforms with (k 1)t . comparing (5.4) with (3.8)
we see that, in the electric case, we have to make the changes q1  q2, q2  q1, p1  p2
and p2  p1 in the equations (4.2),(4.3)and (4.4)4. these changes give, for the sl(2, z)
constants, the expressions:

a =

being  given by:

[q2

[p2

2(e

0 (p1 p2 + q1 q2)],

  q2 p2(e
the constraint (4.4) now reads:

0

0 + q1 p2e0 )

e(q1 + q2)2 + e q2

2 = e

(p1 + p2)2 + e

p2
2.

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

the killing spinors are computed by using the equations (3.10), (3.9), and (5.6).

let us work out again an explicit example ([4]). we will take a bps fundamental

string in the einstein frame [14]:

e = h(r) 3
ds2
e = ph(r),

4 (dt2 + dx 2

1 ) + h(r)

1

4 (dr2 + r2d7)

e  h (1) = 6r67,

h (2) =  = 0,

being h(r) the harmonic function:

r6
r6 .
we will take, moreover, the asymptotic conditions 

h(r) = 1 +

the equation (5.8) gives, for this case:

0  () and 

0  ().

1 = e
q2

0 (p1 + p2

0)2 + e

0 p2
2.

4 this is nothing but the electric-magnetic duality h (1)

 s(2), h (2)

   s(1).

9

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

we can use this equation to eliminate q1 in equations (5.6) and write (5.6) in terms of p1
and p2 alone (q1 is given in (5.11) in terms of p1 and p2) . this gives:

a =

b =

p1
q1

0(p2

0 + p1) + e

0 p2]

p2
c = 
q1
e
q1

d =

0

(p2

0 + p1).

(5.12)

again, just plugging this background conguration on (3.7) and (3.8) we get the

sl(2, z) multiplet:

e

= c2h(r)

1

2 + d2h(r)

1

2

 =

ach(r) + bd
c2h(r) + d2

h (1)
h (2)

= dh (1)

= bh (1).

the coecient r of the harmonic form is now given, using (5.11), by:

q1 = z s(1) = 6r6w7  r6

(p1, p2)  r6 = qe

0 (p1 + p2
6w7

0)2 + e

0 p2
2

(5.13)

,

(5.14)

where we denoted by w7 the volume of the unit s7. the equation (5.8) has to be interpre-
tated, again, as equating the masses (more properly, tensions) of the components of the
sl(2, z) multiplet when measured with the einstein metric.

we can obtain the killing spinor of the (p1, p2) strings from equation (3.10):

(p1, p2) = e

i

2 ( p1, p2 )(r)f 1,

(5.15)

where (p1, p2)(r) is given in this case by:

sin (p1, p2)(r) =

cos (p1, p2)(r) =

p2[h(r)]

,

0 (p2

(5.16)

and f 1 is the killing spinor of the fundamental (1, 0) string:

f 1 = [h(r)] 3

16 e 7

2 7 r

e i+1

2 ii+1 0.

6

yi=1

(5.17)

in the above equation, i are the angles of the transverse s7 and the product has to be
taken from right to left. 0 is a constant weyl spinor satisfying:

010 = 

0

(5.18)

now, we can compute the adm masses of the electric multiplet in the modied
einstein frame similarly to our calculation of the masses for the magnetic multiplets in the
previous section. by comparing

with the asymptotic behaviour of the modied einstein metric associated to the metric in

we obtain:

(5.20)

(5.21)

note that this adm mass has units of mass per unit of brane volume (1/(lenght2)), so it
corresponds to the tensions of the (p1, p2) strings. note also that the p1 charged objects
contribute to the mass with terms of order p1 (as corresponds to the perturbative string
modes) whereas the p2 charged objects contribute to the mass with term of the order
p2/gs (as it corresponds to d-brane solitons). thus, the background (5.13) corresponds to
bound states of fundamental strings and d1-branes [13].

6. conclusions and discussion.

the equations of motion of type iib supergravity exactly map the equations of type
iib string theory through the identications (3.1). the s-duality symmetry of type iib
string theory corresponds to those u (1) local transformations of type iib supergravity
(2.2) mantaining the reality of the gauge (3.1). the sl(2, z) multiplets associated to
the solutions of type iib string theory that we have considered here, are given in (3.7)
and (3.8), where the sl(2, z) constants are xed by the expectation values of the scalars
and the electric or magnetic charges in (4.2) or (5.6). the killing spinors of the sl(2, z)
multiplets are then computed by (3.10).

in our approach, the self-duality of the d3 branes is reected by the fact that the
supergravity ve-form is neutral under u (1) transformations. moreover, the killing spinors

11

associated to d3 multiplets are related by global rotations (see equations (3.9) and (3.10)),
due to the constant nature of the scalars for these solutions.

we have checked our general expressions with the previously constructed sl(2, z)
multiplets to which the solitonic ve brane ([5]) and fundamental string ([4]) belong, ob-
taining the same result. in [5] and [4] a dierent approach for these particular cases was
employed. in particular, the eintein metric was not invariant under the sl(2, z) transfor-
mation and the harmonic form coecients (4.10) and (5.14) were found by a rescaling due
to charge quantization arguments. in other words, the solution to the eective iib equa-
tions of motion which was used to construct the multiplet was not itself in the multiplet.
in our approach, the harmonic form coecient is xed by the consistency constraint (4.4)
and the einstein metric is invariant. moreover, we have provided the relation between the
members of the multiplet in (4.2) and (5.6).

any sl(2, z) multiplet containing a given representative with at least one non-
vanishing charge (electric or magnetic) associated to the ns-ns or r-r three forms can
be straightforwardly constructed with our formalism. however, it does not cover exotic
solutions as the d-instantons ([15]) and the d7-branes ([16]). these solutions are not
charged with respect to any of the three forms (or their duals) appearing in the theory.
for the d-instantons, one should adapt our formalism to the euclidean space. the d7
case is a very subtle one. this background solution is magnetically charged with respect to
the one-form r-r eld strenght d (which, of course, is globally dened). this means that
the eld  is not single-valued along one-cycles surrounding the brane. we can, in this
case, cover the cycle with two charts. inside any chart  is single-valued, so we can apply
(3.6) safely. the sl(2, z) transformations performed in both charts are, however, not
independent. we have to demand the equality of d and d in the overlapping regions
(i.e., the eld strenghts have to be globally dened). it is not dicult from (3.6) to show
that the sl(2, z) transformations preserving the single-valued character of the one form
eld strenghts associated to the potentials  and  are those with c = 0, which just change
the magnetic charge associated to d and the expectation values of the scalar elds. the
transformations with c 6= 0 lead to non single-valued eld strenghts. this suggests that
bound states with d7 branes are absent [13].
