abstract

due to the non-commutative nature of quaternions we introduce the concept of left
and right action for quaternionic numbers. this gives the opportunity to manipulate
appropriately the h-eld. the standard problems arising in the denitions of transpose,
determinant and trace for quaternionic matrices are overcome. we investigate the possi-
bility to formulate a new approach to quaternionic group theory. our aim is to highlight
the possibility of looking at new quaternionic groups by the use of left and right operators
as fundamental step toward a clear and complete discussion of unication theories in
physics.

introduction

complex numbers have played a dual role in physics, rst as a technical tool in resolving
dierential equation (classical optics) or via the theory of analytic functions for performing
real integrations, summing series, etc.; secondly in a more essential way in the development
of quantum mechanics and later field theory. with quaternions, for the rst type of
application, i.e. as a means to simplify calculations, we can quote the original work of
hamilton [1], but this only because of the late development of vector algebra by gibbs and
heaviside [2]. even maxwell used quaternions as a tool in his calculations, e.g.
in the
treatise of electricity and magnetism [3] where we nd the -operator expressed by the
three quaternionic imaginary units.

notwithstanding the hamiltons conviction that quaternions would soon play a role com-
parable to, if not greater than, that of complex numbers the use of quaternions in physics was
very limited [4]. nevertheless, in the last decades, we nd a renewed interest in the application
of non-commutative elds in mathematics and physics. in physics, we quote quaternionic

1

versions of gauge theories [5]-[8], quantum mechanics and fields [9]-[14], special relativ-
ity [15]. in mathematics, we nd applications of quaternions for tensor products [16, 17],
group representations [18].

in this paper we aim to give a new panoramic review of quaternionic groups. we use the
adjective new since the elements of our matrices will not be simple quaternions but left
and right operators, originally introduced with the name of barred operators [19].

in physics, particularly quantum mechanics, we are accustomed to distinguishing be-
tween states and operators. even when the operators are represented by numerical
matrices, the squared form of operators distinguishes them from the column structure of
the spinors states. only for one-component elds and operators is there potential confu-
sion. in extending quantum mechanics dened over the complex eld to quaternions it has
almost always been assumed that matrix operators contain elements which are numbers
indistinguishable from those of the state vectors. this is an unjustied limitation. in fact,
(non-commutative) hyper-complex theories require left/right operators.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we introduce the quaternionic algebras.
in section 3, we show that the non-commutative nature of the quaternionic eld suggests the
use of left/right operators. in section 4, we nd the appropriate denitions of transpose, trace
and determinant for quaternionic matrices. such a section contains the new classication of
quaternionic groups.
in section 5, we present some applications of left/right operators in
physics. our conclusions are drawn in the nal section.

2 quaternionic states

complex numbers can be constructed from the real numbers by introducing a quantity i
whose square is 1:

c = r1 + ir2

(r1,2  r) .

likewise, we can construct the quaternions from the complex numbers in exactly the same
way by introducing another quantity j whose square is 1,

q = c1 + jc2

(c1,2  c) ,

and which anti-commutes with i

ij = ji = k .

in introducing the quaternionic algebra, let us follow the conceptual approach of hamil-
ton. in 1843, the irish mathematician attempted to generalize the complex eld in order to
describe the rotations in the three-dimensional space. he began by looking for numbers of
the form

x + iy + jz ,

with i2 = j 2 = 1. hamiltons hope was to do for three-dimensional space what complex
numbers do for the plane. inuenced by the existence of a complex number norm

when he looked at its generalization

cc = (re c)2 + (im c)2 ,

(x  iy  jz)(x + iy + jz) = x2 + y2 + z2  (ij + ji)yz ,

2

to obtain a real number, he had to adopt the anti-commutative law of multiplication for
the imaginary units. nevertheless, with only two imaginary units we have no chance of
constructing a new numerical eld, because assuming

ij =  + i + j

(, ,   r) ,

and using the multiplication associativity, i(ij) = i2j = j, we nd

j =   i  ij = i    ( + i + j)  ,

which implies

thus, we must introduce a third imaginary unit k 6= i, j, with

 =  = 0

and

 2 = 1 .

k = ij = ji .

the h-eld is therefore characterized by three imaginary units i, j, k which satisfy the
following multiplication rules

numbers of the form

i2 = j 2 = k2 = ijk = 1 .

q = x0 + ix + jy + kz

( x0, x, y, z  r ) ,

(1)

(2)

are called (real) quaternions. they are added, subtracted and multiplied according to the
usual laws of arithmetic, except for the commutative law of multiplication.

similarly to rotations in a plane that can be concisely expressed by complex number, a
rotation about an axis passing through the origin and parallel to a given unitary vector u 
(ux, uy, uz) by an angle  can be obtained taking the following quaternionic transformation

where

exp(cid:16) 

2

~h  ~u(cid:17) ~h  ~r exp(cid:16)


2

~h  ~u(cid:17) ,

~h  (i, j, k)

and

~r  (x, y, z) .

in section 5, we shall see how the quaternionic number q in eq. (2), with the identication
x0  ct, can be used to formulate a one-dimensional version of the lorentz group [15]. we
obtain the natural generalization of hamiltons idea

complex/plane  pure imaginary quaternions/space  quaternions/space-time ,

completing the unication of algebra and geometry.

let us now consider the (full) conjugate of q

q = x0  ix  jy  kz .

(3)

we observe that qq and qq are both equal to the real number

n (q) = x2

0 + x2 + y2 + z2 ,

3

which is called the norm of q. when q 6= 0, we can dene

q1 = q/n (q) ,

so quaternions form a zero-division ring.

an important dierence between quaternionic and complex numbers is related to the
denition of the conjugation operation. whereas with complex numbers we can dene only
one type of conjugation

i  i ,

working with quaternionic numbers we can introduce dierent conjugation operations. in-
deed, with three imaginary units we have the possibility to dene besides the standard
conjugation (3), the six new operations

(i, j, k)  (i, +j, +k) , (+i, j, +k) , (+i, +j, k) ;

(i, j, k)  (+i, j, k) , (i, +j, k) , (i, j, +k) .

these last six conjugations can be concisely represented by q and q as follows

q  iqi , jqj , kqk ,
q  iqi , jqj , kqk .

it could seem that the only independent conjugation be represented by q. nevertheless, q
can also be expressed in terms of q, in fact

q = 

1
2 (q + iqi + jqj + kqk) .

(4)

we conclude this section by introducing a compact notation to represent quaternionic

(5)

(6)

states. let

h  (cid:16) 1 , ~h(cid:17)

and

h  (cid:16) 1 , ~h(cid:17)

denote the h-eld generators and

x  ( x0 , ~x )

and

x  ( x0 , ~x )

be contravariant and covariant real quadrivectors,

g = (+, , , ) .

quaternionic states will be written in terms of (5,6) as follows

q = xh = xh  x0 + ~h  ~x ,

and consequently the (full) quaternionic conjugate, q will read

q = xh = xh  x0  ~h  ~x .

from now on, greek letters will be run from 0 to 3.

3 quaternionic left/right operators

due to the non-commutative nature of quaternions we must distinguish between q~h and ~hq.
thus, it is appropriate to consider left and right-actions for our imaginary units i, j and k.
let us dene the operators

and

l  (cid:16) 11 , ~l(cid:17)  hl ,

~l = (li, lj, lk) ,

r  (cid:16) 11 , ~r(cid:17)  hr ,

~r = (ri, rj, rk) ,

which act on quaternionic states in the following way

l : h  h ,

lq = hq  h ,

and

the algebra of left/right generators can be concisely expressed by

r : h  h ,

rq = q h  h .

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

l2

i = l2

j = l2

k = liljlk = r2

i = r2

j = r2

k = rkrjri = 11 ,

and by the commutation relations

[ li,j,k , ri,j,k ] = 0 .

in this section we will discuss three dierent types of operators. operators h-linear,

c-linear, r-linear from the right. for simplicity of notation we introduce

ox : h  h ,

to represent quaternionic operators right-linear on the x-eld. operators which act only
from the left,

oh = al  hl ,

a  r4 ,

are obviously h-linear from the right

and r-linear from the left

l(q) = (lq)  ,

  h ,

l(q) =  (lq) ,

  r .

let us now consider the sixteen generators

m  l  r .

due to left and right actions of the imaginary units i, j, k the corresponding operator

or = am  a l  r  hl  hr ,

a  r16 ,

are restricted to be r-linear

m (q) = (m q)  =  (m q) ,

  r .

5

finally, considering the right action to the only i-complex imaginary unit

we obtain right c-linear operators

mn  l  rn ,

n = 1, 2 ,

oc = anmn  anl  rn  hl  cr  hl  hr ,

an  r8 ,

in fact

the classication of right h/c/r-linear can be summarized by

mn(q) = (mnq)  ,

  c .

oh  oc  or ,

note that all these operators are obviously r-linear from the left.

let us now analyze the product of two right r-linear operators

oa

r = a m , ob

r = b m  ,

in terms of left/right quaternionic generators is given by

oa

r ob

r = a b ll  rr .

from such a relation we can immediately obtain the product of right c-linear and r-linear
operators. the full conjugation operation for left/right operators is dened by a simultaneous
change in the sign of left/right quaternionic imaginary units, i.e.

l

 = l = g l

and

r

 = r = g r .

thus,

o

r = a l

  r

 = al  r

 hl  hr .

(11)

for operators product conjugations we have

r ob

(cid:16)oa

r(cid:17)

= ab  (ll  rr)
= ab  (ll )  (rr)
= ab l
= ob 
r oa 

  r

r


 l

r .

in section 4, dealing with quaternionic matrices we shall distinguish between (right) r-

linear quaternionic groups,

and c-linear quaternionic groups,

gl (n, hl  hr) ,

gl (n, hl  cr) .

for a clear and complete discussion of standard quaternionic groups,

gl (n, hl) ,

6

the reader is referred to gilmores book [20]. the use of left/right operators give new oppor-
tunities in quaternionic group theory. let us observe as follows: the so-called symplectic
complex representation of a quaternion (state) q

by a complex column matrix, is

q = c1 + jc2

(c1,2  c) ,

q  (cid:18) c1

c2 (cid:19) .

(12)

the operator representation of li, lj and lk consistent with the above identication

li  (cid:18) i

0 i (cid:19) = i3 ,

0

lj  (cid:18) 0 1

0 (cid:19) = i2 ,

1

lk  (cid:18) 0

i

i

0 (cid:19) = i1 , (13)

has been known since the discovery of quaternions. it permits any quaternionic number or
matrix to be translated into a complex matrix, but not necessarily vice-versa. eight real num-
bers are required to dene the most general 2  2 complex matrix but only four are needed to
dene the most general quaternion. in fact since every (non-zero) quaternion has an inverse,
only a subclass of invertible 2  2 complex matrices are identiable with quaternions. c-linear
quaternionic operators complete the translation [19]. the right quaternionic imaginary unit

ri  (cid:18) i 0

0 i (cid:19) ,

adds four additional degrees of freedom, obtained by matrix multiplication of the correspond-
ing matrices,

ri , liri , ljri , lkri ,

and so we have a set of rules for translating from any 2  2 complex matrices to c-linear
operators, or. this opens new possibilities for quaternionic numbers, see for example the
one-dimensional version of the glashow group [7]. obviously, this translation does not apply
to odd-dimensional complex matrices [21].

4 quaternionic groups

every set of basis vectors in vn a vector space, can be related to every other coordinate
system by an n  n non singular matrix. the n  n matrix groups involved in changing
bases in the vector spaces rn, cn and hl
n are called general linear groups of n  n matrices
over the reals, complex and quaternions

gl (n, r)



gl (n, c)



gl (n, hl)

gl (2n, c)



gl (n, hl  cr)





gl (4n, r)



gl (n, hl  hr) .

7

before discussing the groups gl (n, hl  hr) and gl (n, hl  cr), we introduce a new def-
inition of transpose for quaternionic matrices which will allow us to overcome the diculties
due to the non-commutative nature of the quaternionic eld (our denition, applying to
standard quaternions, will be extended to complex and real linear quaternions).

4.1 quaternionic transpose denition

the customary convention of dening the transpose m t of the matrix m is

(m t)rs = msr .

(14)

in general, however, for two quaternionic matrices m and n one has

(m n )t 6= n tm t ,

whereas this statement hold as an equality for complex matrices. for example, the usual
denition (14) implies

and

(cid:20)(cid:0) q1

q2 (cid:1)(cid:18) p1
p2 (cid:19)t
(cid:18) p1

(cid:0) q1

p2 (cid:19)(cid:21)t

= (q1p1 + q2p2)t = q1p1 + q2p2 ,

= pt

1qt

1 + pt

2qt

2 = p1q1 + p2q2 ,

q2 (cid:1)t

(15)

(16)

which are equal only if we use a commutative states. how can we dene orthogonal quater-
nionic states and orthogonal groups? by looking at the previous example, we see that the
problem arises in the dierent position of factors q1,2 and p1,2. the solution is very simple
once seen. it is possible to give a quaternionic transpose which reverses the order of factors.
we have three (equivalent) possibilities to dene qt, namely

x0  ix1 + jx2 + kx3 , x0 + ix1  jx2 + kx3 , x0 + ix1 + jx2  kx3 .

(17)

we choose

qt = x0 + ix1  jx2 + kx3 ,

(18)

which goes back to the usual denition for complex numbers, ct = c  c(1, i). in this way, the
transpose of a product of two quaternions q and p is the product of the transpose quaternions
in reverse order

(qp)t = ptqt .

the proof is straightforward if we recognize the following relation between transpose qt and
conjugate q,

qt = jqj .

what happens for left/right quaternionic operators? observing that for quaternionic states

it = i ,

jt = j ,

kt = k ,

the natural generalization for left/right quaternionic operators is

lt

i = li , lt

j = lj , lt

k = lk  lt

 = ljl

lj ,

8

and

rt

i = ri , rt

j = rj , rt

k = rk  rt

 = rjr

rj .

one-dimensional r-linear transpose operators read

ot

r = a lt

  rt


= ljrjo

rrjlj

 hl  hr .

(19)

thus, in the quaternionic world the transpose m t of the matrix m  gl (n, hl  hr),
dened by

(m t)rs = m t
sr

 hl  hr ,

can be written as

where

m t = ljrjm rjlj = rjljm ljrj ,

(20)

with this new denition of quaternionic transpose, the relation

(m )rs = m 
sr

 hl  hr .

(m n )t = ljrj(m n )rjlj = ljrjn m rjlj

= ljrjn rjljljrjm rjlj
= n tm t

also holds for non-commutative numbers. finally, for c-linear operators, eq. (19) reduces to

ot

c = anlt
= ljo

  rn
clj .

(21)

the fundamental property of reverse ring the order of factors for the transpose of quaternionic
products is again preserved.

4.2 x-mappings

in discussing the classication of the classical (matrix) groups, it is necessary to introduce one
additional concept: the metric. our matrix element are ox-operators, and so it is appropriate
to adopting the metric function, mx, mapping of a pair of vectors into a number eld x

mx : hn  hn  x , mx(, ) = (, )x ,

with ,   hn and (, )x  x. let us now recall the following theorem: the subset of
transformations of basis in vn which preserves the mathematical structure of a metric forms
a subgroup of general linear groups.

groups preserving

bilinear symmetric
bilinear antisymmetric
sesquilinear symmetric

metrics are called

orthogonal
symplectic
unitary .

the previous theorem is valid for all real and complex metric-preserving matrix groups. it
is also valid for quaternionic groups that preserve sesquilinear metrics, since two quaternions
obey (q1q2) = q
it is not true for quaternionic matrices and bilinear metrics, since
two quaternions do not generally commute. nevertheless, it is still possible to associate

2q
1.

9

subgroups of gl (n, hl) with groups that preserve bilinear metrics. in the literature this is
done in the following way. each quaternion in gl (n, hl) is replaced by the corresponding
2  2 complex matrix using the translation rules (13). the subset of matrices in this complex
2n  2n matrix representation of gl (n, hl) that leaves invariant a bilinear metric forms a
group, since the theorem is valid for bilinear metrics on complex linear vector spaces. we can
associate an n  n quaternion-valued matrix with each 2n  2n complex-valued matrix in the
resulting groups that preserve bilinear metrics in the space c2n2n , which is a representation
for the space hl

nn  - gilmore [20].

once we write our complex matrix, we can trivially obtain the generators of complex
orthogonal groups in a standard manner and then we can translate back into quaternionic
language. but this is surely a laborious procedure. dening an appropriate transpose for
quaternionic numbers (18), we can overcome the just-cited diculty. besides, using the
symplectic representation (12), the most general transformation (on quaternionic states) will
be necessarily represented by c-linear quaternionic operators, oc, and for the invariant
metric we have to require a complex projection, mc : h  h  c ,

mc(qtq) = (qtq)c = [(c1  jc

2 )(c1 + jc2)]c = c2

1 + c2

2 .

we wish to emphasize that the introduction of the imaginary unit ri in complex linear
quaternionic operators

(ri) = ri ,

necessarily implies a complex inner product. the new imaginary units ri represents an
anti-hermitian operator, and so it must verify



r (ri)
r (i)

=

=



r ri
r i .

the previous relation is true only if we adopt a complex projection

zc



1  liri

2

z ,

for the inner products

zc

(ri) = izc

 = zc

i = z ri .

obviously, for r-linear operators

implies real inner products,

( ~r) =  ~r ,

mr : h  h  r .

4.3 one-dimensional quaternionic groups

the generators of the unitary and orthogonal groups satisfy the following constraints

groups :
unitary
orthogonal

generators :
a + a = 0 ,
a + at = 0 .

10

for one-dimensional quaternionic groups, we nd

groups
u(1, hl)
u(1, hl  cr)
u(1, hl  hr)
o(1, hl)
o(1, hl  cr)
o(1, hl  hr)

generators
~l
~l , ri
~l , ~r
lj
lj , ljri
lj , ljri , ljrk , rj , lirj , lkrj

at this point, we make a number of observations:

1. - the dierence between orthogonal and unitary groups is manifest for complex linear

quaternionic groups because of the dierent numbers of generators.

2.

- orthogonal and unitary real linear quaternionic groups have the same number of

generators.

3.

- the real groups u(n+, n) and o(n+, n) are identical (there is no dierence
between bilinear and sesquilinear metrics in a real vector space) and this suggest a possible
link between u(n, hl  hr) and o(n, hl  hr).

4. - for real linear quaternionic groups, the invariant metric requires a real projection
(note that ~r represent anti-hermitian operators only for real inner products). let us show
the real invariant metric for u(1, hl  hr) and o(1, hl  hr),

(xy)r = [(x0  ix1  jx2  kx3)(y0 + iy1 + jy2 + ky3)]r = x0y0 + x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 ,
(xty)r = [(x0 + ix1  jx2 + kx3)(y0 + iy1 + jy2 + ky3)]r = x0y0  x1y1 + x2y2  x3y3 .

we can immediately recognize the invariant metric of o(4) and o(2, 2). to complete the
analogy between one-dimensional real linear quaternionic operators and 4-dimensional real
matrices, we observe that besides the subgroups related to the -conjugation (where the sign
of all three imaginary units is changed) and the t-conjugation (where only j  j), we can
dene a new subgroup which leaves invariant the following real metric

where

explicitly,

(xgy)r ,

g = 

1
2 lr = 

1

2 (cid:16)11 + ~l  ~r(cid:17) .

(xgy)r = [(x0  ix1  jx2  kx3)(y0  iy1  jy2  ky3)]r = x0y0  x1y1  x2y2  x3y3 .

the new subgroup,

o(1, hl  hr) ,

ga + ag = 0 ,

represents the one-dimensional quaternionic counterpart of the lorentz group o(1, 3) [15].

the classical groups which occupy a central place in group representation theory and have
many applications in various branches of mathematics and physics are the unitary, special
unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic groups. in order to dene special groups, we must dene
an appropriate trace for our matrices. in fact, for non-commutative numbers the trace of the
product of two numbers is not the trace of the product with reversed factors. with complex

11

linear quaternions we have the possibility to give a new denition of complex trace (t r)
by

t r oa

c = t r anl  rn = a00 + ia01 .

(22)

such a denition implies that for any two complex linear quaternionic operators oa

c and ob

c

t r (oa

cob

c) = t r (ob

coa

c) .

for real linear quaternions we need to use the standard denition of real trace (tr)

tr oa

r = a00 ,

(23)

since the previous complex denition (22) gives

t r (oa

rob

r) 6= t r (ob

roa

r) .

for example, for

we nd

oa

r = rj

and ob

r = rk ,

t r (oa
t r (ob

rob
roa

r) = t r (rjrk) = t r (ri) = 1 ,
r) = t r (rkrj) = +t r (ri) = +1 .

4.4 n-dimensional quaternionic groups

we recall that the generators of the unitary, special unitary, orthogonal groups must satisfy
the following conditions [22]

u(n )
su(n )
o(n )

a + a = 0 ,
a + a = 0 ,
a + at = 0 .

t r a = 0 ,

these conditions also apply for quaternionic groups. for complex symplectic groups we nd

sp(2n )

j a + atj = 0 ,

where

j = (cid:18) 0

1

nn

nn

1

0

nn

nn (cid:19) .

working with quaternionic numbers, we can construct a group preserving a non-singular
antisymmetric metric, for n odd as well as n even. thus for quaternionic symplectic groups
we have

sp(n )

j a + atj = 0 ,

with

j2n2n = (cid:18) 0

5 physical applications

in the last years the left/right action of the quaternionic numbers, expressed by left/right
operators, or, oc, oh, has been very useful in overcoming diculties owing to the non-
commutativity of quaternions. among the successful applications of left/right operators we
mention the one-dimensional quaternionic formulation of lorentz boosts.

5.1 special relativity

the lorentz group, o(3, 1),
is characterized by six parameters, three for rotations and
three for boosts. corresponding to these six parameters there are six generators. the
anti-hermitian generators associated to spatial rotations and the hermitian boost generators
satisfy the following commutation relations

ax = [ay, az] , ax = [bz, by] , bx = [ay, bz] = [by, az] ,
ay = [az, ax] , ay = [bx, bz] , by = [az, bx] = [bz, ax] ,
az = [ax, ay] , az = [by, bx] , bz = [ax, by] = [bx, ay] ,

(24)

13

the idea of combining left and right imaginary units gives the possibility to obtain a one-
dimensional quaternionic representation for boost generators by r-linear quaternionic oper-
ators [15]

boost generators:

~l  ~r ,

1
2

rotation generators:

1

2 (cid:16)~l  ~r(cid:17) .

the four real quantities which identify the space-time point (ct, x, y, z) are represented by
the quaternion

q = ct + ix + jy + kz .

the one-dimensional group o(1, hl  hr) represents the quaternionic counterpart of the
four-dimensional lorentz group o(3, 1). innitesimal rotations about the x-axis and boosts
(ct, x) are respectively given by

qr = (cid:2)1 + x
qb = (cid:2)1 + x

2 (li  ri)(cid:3) q
2 (ljrk  lkrj)(cid:3) q

= ct + ix + j(y  xz) + k(z + xy) ,

= ct + xx + i(x + xct) + jy + kz .

(25)

(26)

in analogy to the connection between the rotation group o(3) and the special unitary
group su(2), there is a natural correspondence between the lorentz group o(3, 1) and the
special linear group sl(2, c). the use of left/right quaternionic imaginary units gives the
possibility to extend such connections to quaternionic group,

o(3)
o(3, 1)




su(2)
sl(2, c)  sl(1, hl  cr) .

 u(1, hl) ,

in fact, combining left quaternionic imaginary units, ~l, with right complex imaginary unit,
ri, we obtain the following one-dimensional representation for rotation and boost generators

ax = li/2 , ay = lj/2 , az = lk/2

 hl ,

and

bx = liri/2 , by = ljri/2 , bz = lkri/2

 hl  cr .

(27)

(28)

now, the four real quantities which identify the space-time point are represented by the
symplectic decomposition of quaternionic spinor states

q =  + j ,

,   c(1, i) ,

(29)

where

with this identications, o(3, 1)-transformations on

q(1 + i)q  ct + ix + jy + kz .

x = 


ct
x
y
z




,

are equivalent to one-dimensional transformations on quaternionic spinors (29). a detailed
discussion is found in ref. [23].

new possibilities, coming out from the use of c-linear quaternionic operators, also appear
in quantum mechanics and field theory, e.g. they allow an appropriate denition of the
momentum operator [12], quaternionic version of standard relativistic equations [12, 13],
lagrangian formalism [25], electroweak model [7] and grand unication theories [8].

5.2 dirac equation

in the complex world, the dirac equation read indierently as

it = h or ti = h .

in the quaternionic world there is a clear dierence in choosing a left or right position for
our complex imaginary unit i. in fact, by requiring norm conservation

tz d3x  = 0 ,

we nd that a left position of the imaginary unit i in the quaternionic dirac equation,

gives

lit  it = h ,

tz d3x  = z d3x [h, i] ,

in general 6= 0 for quaternionic hamiltonians. a right position of the imaginary unit i,

rit  ti = h ,

ensures the norm conservation. from covariance, by treating time and space in the same
way, we obtain the following quaternionic momentum operator

p  ri  p  ri  i .

finally, the quaternionic dirac equation reads

ri  i = m ,

[,  ] = 2g ,

(30)

(31)

with

  m2(hl  cr) and   h2 .

another fundamental ingredient in the formulation of quaternionic relativistic quantum
mechanics is represented by the adoption of a complex geometry [24], necessary in order to
guarantee that ri~ be an hermitian operator

z d3x ri~ = z d3x (ri~) .

the previous relation implies

z d3x  ~i = iz d3x ~ (after integration by parts) = iz d3x ~ .

the dierent position of the imaginary unit i forces the use of a complex projection [24] for
inner products

d3x .

(32)

z d3x  zc

5.3 lagrangian formalism

the use of the variational principle within quaternionic quantum mechanics is non-trivial
because of the non commutative nature of quaternions. in this subsection, we write the dirac
lagrangian density corresponding to the two-component dirac equation. this lagrangian is
complex projected as anticipated in previous articles [25]. the traditional form for the dirac
lagrangian density is

l = i   m  .

(33)

the position of the imaginary unit i is purely conventional in (33) but with a quaternionic
number eld we must recognize that the  operator is more precisely part of the rst
quantized momentum operator ri and that hence to ensure l be an hermitian quantity
we must taken a complex projection of the kinetic term

lkin = (cid:0) ri(cid:1)c
 (cid:0) i(cid:1)c
= (cid:0) (cid:1)c i .

the requirement of hermiticity however says nothing about the dirac mass term in eq. (33).
it is here that appeal to the variational principle must be made. a variation  in  cannot
brought to the extreme right because of the imaginary unit i. the only consistent procedure
is to generalize the variational rule that says that  and  must be varied independently.
we thus apply independent variations to  () and i ((i)). similarly for   and (i ).
now, to obtain the desired dirac equation for  and its adjoint equation for , we must
modify the mass term into

lmass = m(cid:0) (cid:1)c .

l = (cid:0) ri  m (cid:1)c .

(34)

the nal result for l is

5.4 electroweak models

let us now eaxamine the fermion/quark sector of salam-weinberg model [26]. the rst
family is represented by

(cid:18) 

e (cid:19) and (cid:18) u

d (cid:19) .

in the standard representation [7, 12]

l = (cid:18) l ul

el dl (cid:19) , r = (cid:18) r ur

er dr (cid:19)

 m4(h) .

(35)

the massless fermion electroweak lagrangian

where

lf ermion = (cid:0) lril + rrir(cid:1)c ,

  m4(cr) ,

is global invariant under the quaternionic glashow gauge group [27]

u(1, hl)l  u(1, cr)y .

16

(36)

(37)

in the chiral representation [23] l/r, el/r, ul/r and dl/r are one-dimensional quater-

nionic spinors and so can be accommodate in

l = (cid:18) l ul

el dl (cid:19) , r = (cid:18) r ur

er dr (cid:19)

 m2(h) .

the lagrangian for the masseless fermion sector

is now global invariant under the right complex gauge group

lf ermion = (cid:0) lril + rrir(cid:1)c ,

su(2, cr)l  u(1, cr)y .

6 conclusions

(38)

(39)

(40)

the more exciting possibility that quaternionic or octonionic equations will eventually play
a signicant role in mathematics and physics is synonymous, for some physicist, with the
advent of a revolution in physics comparable to that of quantum mechanics.

for example, adler suggested [28] that the color degree of freedom postulated in the
harari-shupe model [29, 30] (where we can think of quarks and leptons as composites of
other more fundamental fermions, preons) could be sought in a non-commutative extension
of the complex eld. surely a stimulating idea. nevertheless, we think that it would be
very strange if standard quantum mechanics did not permit a quaternionic or octonionic
description other than in the trivial sense that complex numbers are contained within the
quaternions or octonions.

in the last few years much progress has been achieved in manipulating such elds. we
quote the quaternionic version of electroweak theory [7], where the glashow group is expressed
by the one-dimensional quaternionic group u(1, hl)  u(1, cr), quaternionic guts [8] and
special relativity, where the lorentz group is represented by o(1, hl  hr). we also recall
new possibilities related to the use of octonions in quantum mechanics [31], in particular
in writing a one-dimensional octonionic dirac equation. the link between octonionic and
quaternionic versions of standard quantum physics is represented by the use of a complex
geometry [24].

in this paper we observed that beyond the study of matrix groups with simple quater-
nionic elements, oh, one can consider more general groups with matrix elements of the form
or and oc. to the best of our knowledge these more general matrix groups have not been
studied in the literature. we overcome the problems arising in the denitions of transpose,
determinant and trace for quaternionic matrices. for octonionic elds [32] we must admit
a more complicated situation, yet our discussion can be also proposed for non-associative
numbers.

finally, we hope that this paper emphasizes the possibility of using hyper-complex num-
bers in mathematics and physics and could represent an important step towards a complete
and clear discussion on hyper-complex group and field theories.
