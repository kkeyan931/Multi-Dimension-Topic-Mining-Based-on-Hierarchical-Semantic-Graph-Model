abstract

the process of collision of two parallel domain walls in a supersymmetric model is studied
both in eective lagrangian approximation and by numerical solving of the exact classical eld
problem. for small initial velocities we nd that the walls interaction looks like elastic reection
with some delay. it is also shown that in such approximation internal parameter of the wall
may be considered as a time-dependent dynamical variable.

now it is well-known that in a wide class of supersymmetric theories families of the so-called
bps domain walls exist, see e.g. [1, 2, 3] and references therein. these families of domain walls
link various supersymmetric vacua. although the internal structure of each domain wall within
the family is dierent, they all have the same energy. so each family of domain walls is
degenerate with respect to at least one parameter transformation, which may be considered as
a label of each specic domain wall conguration. to be more concrete let us consider theory
described by the superpotential

w (, x) =

m2


 

1
3

3  x 2 ,

(1)

where m is a mass parameter and  and  are coupling constants. we assume that  and  are
real and positive. the lagrangian for the real parts of the scalar elds is given for this theory
by the expression

l = ()2 + ()2  m2

  2  2!2

 4222 .

(2)

the potential term of eq. (2) has four degenerate vacuum states, shown in fig. 1. this theory
posses a wide class of domain walls, which link dierent vacua of the theory. these domain
wall congurations may be obtained as solutions of bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfeld (bps,
ref. [4]) equations, which look in the case of eq. (2) like

df
dz
dh
dz

= 1  f 2  h2 ,
= 

f h .

(3)

here  = /, m = 1 and z is a space coordinate. as it was shown in refs. [1, 5], for the case
 = 4 solutions for f (z) and h(z) may be obtained in analytical form:

f (z) =

a(e2z  1)
a + 2ez + ae2z , h2(z) =

2ez

a + 2ez + ae2z ,

(4)

where a is continuous parameter, 0  a  +.

the solution (4) links vacua states 1 and 2. depending on a the specic form of f (z)
and h(z) looks quite dierent. considering region 0 < a < 1, we may introduce dierent
parameterization:

cosh s =

.

(5)

1
a

in terms of the parameter s the functions f (z) and h(z) look like

f (z) =

1

2 (cid:18)tanh

z  s
2

+ tanh

z + s

2 (cid:19) ,

2

h2(z) =

1

2 (cid:18)1  tanh

z  s
2

tanh

z + s

2 (cid:19) .

(6)

from eqs. (6) it is clear that at large s functions f and h split into two orthogonal to z-axis
elementary walls corresponding to the transitions 1  3 at z = s and 3  2 at z = s. thus
at large s eqs. (6) describe two far separated domain walls. the purpose of this research is
to study the dynamics of the collision between these two separated domain walls 1  3 and
3  2. evidently, this question is outside of the bps approximation and to study this problem
we should solve exact eld equations, which follow form the lagrangian (2).

recently in ref. [5] the problem of intersection of two domain walls in this model was
considered. the authors didnt solve the exact equations of motion, but used more simple
reasonable approach considering the parameter a as dynamical eective variable.
in what
follows we shall use both methods, considering a (or s) as a function of time t, as well as
solving exact equations of motion for elds f and h. we shall demonstrate that eective
lagrangian method is consistent with solution of cauchy problem for exact eld system.

in terms of a (5) the energy of the domain wall conguration (4) has the form

e = e0 + e1 , e1 =

1
2

+

z

a2 a cosh3 z + cosh 2z
(a cosh z + 1)4

dz .

(7)

here e0 does not depend on a and is sum of energy densities of two far separated walls 1  3
and 3  2. its specic form is inessential for our future consideration. replacing a(t) by s(t)
according to eq. (5), we get the following eective lagrangian for the new dynamical variable
s:

lef f =

m(s) s2 ,

1
2

(8)

(9)

where

m(s) = 2(cid:20)s tanh s +

5
3 

2s

tanh s

+

1

tanh2 s (cid:18) s

tanh s  1(cid:19)(cid:21) .

the eective lagrangian (8) yields the following dierential equation for the function s(t):

m(s)s +

1
2

m(s) s2 = 0 .

(10)

to observe the process of the walls collision we have to start with initial conguration (4) with
some s(0)  1 and s(0) < 0. as the parameter s has a meaning of distance between the walls,
such conguration corresponds to 1  3 and 3  2 walls moving along z-axis towards each
other. numerical solving of eq. (10) shows that s(t) decreases to zero. in the range of small s
the solution can be obtained analytically:

m(s) 

16
15

s2 ,

s(t) = q2s(t) s(t)(t  t) + s2(t) ,

(11)

3

where t denotes the moment of transition from numerical solving of eq. (10) to analytical
solution (11). while s decreases from + to 0, the parameter a changes from 0 to 1. at s = 0
(point a in fig. 2) we have for the elds:

f (z) = tanh(z/2) ,

h(z) =

1

2 cosh (z/2)

.

(12)

in the range 1 < a < + the parameter s, dened by eq. (5), becomes pure imaginary.
therefore it is suitable to introduce s as

the eective lagrangian for s is analogous to (8):

cos s =

1
a

.

lef f =

2

m(s)s

with

m(s) = 2(cid:20)s tan s

+

2s

tan s

+

1

tan2 s (cid:18) s

tan s  1(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(13)

(14)

(15)

at the moment when a = 1 (or s = 0) we pass from s to s which increases from 0 to /2. at
s = /2 (point b in fig. 2) the elds f and h have the form:

f (z) = tanh z ,

h(z)  0 .

(16)

after that, s decreases to 0 and becomes pure imaginary. therefore at the moment of s = 0
(point c in fig. 2) we return back to s, which begins to increase from 0 to +. note, that
for s we also used analytical solutions at s  1 and |s  /2|  1. the summary (s, s)
t-dependencies for two initial relative velocities s(0) = 0.05 and s(0) = 0.1 are represented in
fig. 3.

developed dynamical variable approximation seems to be reasonable, but needs in numerical
conrmation. we performed calculation of evolution of the described initial conguration by
solving numerically the cauchy problem for the system of two dierential equations in partial
derivatives for the elds f and h. these equations are consequence of the lagrangian (2).
results of the numerical solving of the cauchy problem for elds f and h were compared with
the elds proles obtained for current value of the parameter (s, s) at all times t. for not too
large values of s(0) we observed good agreement. it conrms that the parameter (s, s) is a good
dynamical variable for describing the process of the bps domain walls collision in the susy
model that was considered.

note, that with s(0) being increased in numerical calculations of the exact eld problem we
observe progressing dierence from the eld proles restored with the help of the dynamical
variable method. the question whether it is a problem of computational scheme or it is related
with excitation of other than zero mode eld degrees of freedom is under consideration now.
