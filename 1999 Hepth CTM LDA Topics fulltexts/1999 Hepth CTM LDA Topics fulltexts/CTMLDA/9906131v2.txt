abstract: a 3d topological sigma model describing maps from a 3-manifold y to
a calabi-yau 3-fold m is introduced. as the model is topological, we can choose an
arbitrary metric on m. upon scaling up the metric, the path integral by construction
localizes on the moduli space of special lagrangean submanifolds of m. we couple
the theory to dynamical gauge elds and discuss the case where m has a mirror and
the gauge group is u(1).

1. introduction

two dimensional topological sigma models [1] have found many interesting applica-
tions both in physics and mathematics. in string theory, for example, the eective
eld theory of curved d3-branes wrapped around holomorphically embedded 2-cycles
in a hyper kahler manifold, in a limit where the cycle shrinks to zero size, turns out
to be a 2d topological sigma model [2]. this eective eld theory has then been
used to study the existence of bound states of d-branes. from the mathematical
point of view, topological sigma models have provided an alternative formulation of
floer groups and jones polynomials in knot theory. as in the case of donaldson the-
ory, where physical reformulation [3] has proven to be very useful and enlightening,
specially in the analysis and determination of donaldson invariants [4, 5], one may
also hope that the reformulation of floer groups and jones polynomials in terms of
a topological quantum eld theory shed light on the structure of these topological
invariants.

the sigma model constructed in [1] (the a-model [6]) is a theory of maps
x :   m , where  is a riemann surface and m a complex manifold. the topo-
logical structure of the model allows one to choose an arbitrary metric on m. when
the metric is scaled up, it can be seen that the dominent contributions to the path
integral come from the holomorphic maps satisfying

zx = 0 ,

(1.1)

where z, z are complex coordinates on , and ,  indicate the complex tangent
indices on m.

1

interestingly, the holomorphicity condition (1.1) also appears in the study of d-
branes wrapping around riemann surfaces embedded in m. roughly speaking, type
ii string theory compactied on r6 m, m being a hyper kahler manifold, has bps
states in the form of d3-branes wrapping around s1.  is embedded in m through
x, so x is part of the brane coordinates in the ambient space. one can see that these
solitonic states in general break the supersymmetry of the underlying superstring
theory unless the embedding maps are holomorphic and the u(1) connection (being
part of the low energy degrees of freedom) is at.

considering d3-branes wrapping around 3-cycles in a calabi-yau 3-fold m and
demanding supersymmetry leads to some new constraints known as the special la-
grangean submanifold conditions [7, 8]

xk = 0 ,

x(im ) = 0 .

(1.2)

here x is an embedding of a 3-manifold y to m. k and  represent the kahler
and holomorphic 3-form on m, respectively, and  indicates the pull-back operation.
the 3-cycles satisfying eqs. (1.2) are sometimes called supersymmetric 3-cycles.

now taking eqs. (1.2) as the corresponding equations to (1.1) in 3 dimensions, it
is interesting to see whether the above 2-dimensional sigma model can be generalized
to 3 dimensions. if such, then the path integral of the corresponding sigma model, in
some scaling limit of the parameters entering the lagrangean, would localize on the
moduli space of solutions to (1.2). as in two dimensions, one may expect that the
eective low energy description of curved d5-branes wrapping around s1  s1  y ,
where y is a supersymmetric 3-cycle in m shrinking to zero size, is given by a 3d
topological sigma model of above type. in [9], using the bv method, a 3 dimensional
sigma model has been constructed which has some common properties with the one
that we will introduce here. our motivation, approach, and results, though, are
dierent.

this paper is organized as follows. to begin with, in section 2 we take equa-
tions (1.2) as the starting point for the construction of a 3-dimensional topological
sigma model. apart from the bosonic elds x, we introduce some fermionic elds
needed to dene a brst-like symmetry. having had the equations and brst sym-
metry, we proceed to construct a lagrangean which is brst trivial. next we discuss
the moduli space of solutions to (1.2) where the dominent contributions to the path
integral come from. in section 3, we couple the theory to dynamical gauge elds. as
in [1], a consistent coupling to the gauge elds requires a modication of the brst
transformation rules. the lagrangean describing the dynamics of gauge multiplet is
then obtained by dimensional reduction of the lagrangean of twisted n = 2 sym in
four dimensions. the case where the gauge group is u(1) and the target manifold m

has a mirror fm is of particular interest. the moduli space of solutions to the xed
point equations, in this case, turns out to be parametrized by the mirror manifold fm .

at the end, we have collected the conventions and some derivations in an appendix.

2. a topological sigma model

in this section we aim to construct a topological sigma model of maps x : y  m,
which has the special lagrangean conditions (1.2) as its xed point equations. let
us indicate the indices on y by i, j, . . . , and those on m by , , . . . it will prove
convenient, if instead of (1.2), we consider the equations s = kij = 0, with

s = 1 +

ijkx 

i x 

j x 

k  ,

1
3!h
j k ,

kij = x 

i x 

where we have dened x 
metric;

i  ix , and h indicates the determinant of the induced

h = det hij =

1
3!{ijkmnlhimhjnhkl} = det(ix jx g) .

as we are describing the theory on the embedded 3-manifold, in the following, we
always use the induced metric to raise or lower the indices on y . the prescription
for the construction of the lagrangean is now as follows.

first we introduce a ghost eld , the fermionic partner of x , and the brst

operator  with an action

x  = i  ,

 = 0 ,

(2.1)

where  is a constant anticommuting parameter.  is a section of x(t ), with t
the tangent bundle of m. further we need to introduce an anti-ghost eld , an
anti-ghost two-form ij (the conjugate elds to s and kij), as well as a scalar eld h
and a two-form hij. the transformation laws are now dened to be

(h1/4) =  h1/4h ,
(h1/4 j
i ) =  h1/4h j

i

,

(h1/4h) = 0 ,

(h1/4h j

i ) = 0 .

(2.2)

let us dene the operator q by  = i{q, }, for any eld . we would like the
lagrangean to be a brst commutator, i.e. l = i{q, }, for some gauge fermion .

where  is an arbitrary real parameter. the action now reads

the auxiliary elds h and hij have no dynamics and can be integrated out using

their equations of motion. doing this, the bosonic part of the action becomes

recall that the action was dened to be a brst commutator. therefore the
path integral  upon assuming that the measure is also invariant under the brst
transformations  is independent of the parameter  as well as the metric on m (or
more generally independent of any data entering ). hence, in computing the path
integral, an arbitrary and convenient value for these parameters can be chosen. for
instance, we may take the limit   0. or equivalently, we may scale the metric as
g  tg for t a real parameter, and then take the limit t  . in both limits,
the path integral will localize around the solutions of the following equations

ijkx

k ( + ) = 0 .

by eq. (2.4), this is equivalent to eqs. (1.2) dening the special lagrangean submani-
folds of m. let us indicate the moduli space of solutions to these equations by msl
and study the tangent space at y .

2.1 the tangent space to msl
let x  describe a special lagrangean submanifold of m. we deform x  to a nearby
map x  + x , and ask under what conditions this new map is still a special la-
grangean submanifold. for x  not to have any component obtainable by a dieo-
morphism on y , we demand that x  belong to the normal bundle at y , i.e.

g ix x  = 0 .

to nd the tangent space to msl at y , we impose the special lagrangean condi-
tions (im s = kij = 0) on x  +x . following the same line of arguments as in (2.6),
for the lagrangean condition (i.e. kij = 0) we get
j x k)  j(x 

i x k)  ij  ji ,

0 = [i(x )x 

j]k = i(x 

(2.9)

where i  x x 
i k. as the pull-back of the kahelr form is zero, the complex
structure provides an isomorphism between the tangent space, ty m, and the normal

 x  is a tangent vector at y . contracting this vector
space, ny m at y . as such, j 
with the metric and pulling it back gives a one-form on y . hence, i is a one-form
on y .

the implication of the special lagrangean condition can be seen more easily by

writing the kahler form and  in the vielbein bases (here n = 3),

k = e1  en+1 + e2  en+2 + e3  en+3 ,
 = (e1 + ien+1)  (e2 + ien+2)  (e3 + ien+3) ,

or in components

k = ea

,

(2.10)

where a, b, . . . = 1, 2, 3. we adopt the vielbeins such that ea

(2.13)

equations (2.9) and (2.13) imply that for the map x  + x  to be a special
lagrangean submanifold of m, the one-form i = x x 
i k must be closed and
coclosed [10, 11]. therefore any harmonic one-form  on y species a direction in
which a special lagrangean submanifold can be deformed in msl, and the dimension
of msl equals b1, the rst betti number of the manifold y . looking back to (2.8)
shows that, in the background of a map x  describing a special lagrangean sub-
manifold of m, zero modes of  satisfy the same equations that x  does in (2.9)

and (2.13). consequently, if b1 > 0, there exist  zero modes and the partition
function identically vanishes. to soak up the zero modes, while maintaining the
topological characteristic of the theory, we need to insert some brst invariant op-
erators with the right ghost number in to the path integral. this leads us to look for
the cohomology classes of the operator q. following [1], these cohomology classes
can be constructed and be shown that are in correspondence with the de rham
cohomology classes of m.

3. coupling to gauge elds

we would like now to couple the sigma model of the previous section to dynamical
gauge elds of a compact gauge group g. as in [1], g is taken to be the group of
automorphisms of m preserving all the structures on the manifold. the g action on
m is through the vector elds va = v 
a e, a = 1, . . . , n (n is the dimension of g),
representing the group generators, i.e.

[va, vb] = f c

ab vc ,

for fabc the structure constants of g. the fact that the g action preserves all the
structures on m means that the lie derivatives of the metric, kahler form, and
holomorphic 3-form all have to vanish:

lva(g) = lva(k) = lva() = 0 ,

implying that

kv 
a + v 

v 

va + va = 0
a = 0
a = 0 .

a + kv 
a + v 

in the following, rst we discuss the lagrangean of the gauge sector. next, as the
gauge group acts nontrivially on m and since 2 acting on the gauge multiplet pro-
duces a gauge transformation, we will see how the transformation rules in (2.1) need
to be modied.

the topological lagrangean describing the dynamics of gauge sector can be ob-
tained more conveniently by dimensional reduction of donaldson-witten theory in
four dimensions.1 the lagrangean of the donaldson-witten theory, on the other
hand, can be obtained by twisting the lagrangean of n = 2 sym theory on r4. as
a result, one nds the following eld content and lagrangean. in the bosonic sec-
tor there are a gauge eld a, two scalars  and , and in the fermionic sector we

1alternatively, one may follow [12] to construct the lagrangean of the gauge multiplet.

take the underlying four manifold to be y  r, for y the embedded 3-manifold.
let t parametrize the line r and simply require that the elds not depend on t. set-

(3.4)

as y has no boundary, the second term in the action vanishes by the bianchi identity.
so the xed point equations reduce to

fij = 0 ,

di = di = 0 .

notice that g  2 acting on the elds in (3.4) produces an innitesimal gauge
transformation. so to couple the gauge multiplet to the sigma model we need to
change the transformation rules in (2.1) such that 2 is not zero but a gauge trans-
formation. firstly, note that the innitesimal action of g on the coordinates is
a , for a the gauge parameter. so to have 2 = g, we need to change
gx   av 
the transformations (2.1) to

x  = i  ,

 =  av 
a .

this, in particular, gives the proper gauge transformation of  as a section of x(t ):

g  av 

a  .

with this change, the covariant derivative of x , dix  = ix  + aa
a , transforms
(just like ) as a vector under g. as we are interested in having a set of gauge
invariant equations, and since the metric, k and  are all invariant under the g
action, we replace s and kij with

i v 

1
3!

s = 1 +
kij = dix djx k .

(det(gdix djx ))1/2ijkdix djx dkx  ,

let us now see if any changes need to be made in the transformation rules of
 and ij. since the action is brst-exact and we want to maintain its invariance
under ,  has to be a gauge invariant quantity

0 = s = 2 = g .

on the other hand, as s and k are gauge invariant, a look back to (2.3) shows that
the conjugate elds  and ij also have to be gauge invariant. this implies that the
transformation rules (2.2) do not need any changes. the gauge invariant version of
the sigma model action can now be derived by varying the  with respect to the
newly dened , lsig = i{q, }. this turns out to be the action in (2.5), if we do
the following substituations:

ix   dix  ,
i  i + aa

i  v 

a  .

(3.5)

the total lagrangean is then the sum of the lagrangeans lsig and (3.3)

3.1 the u(1) case

l = lg + lsig .

in the case of u(1) gauge group with a trivial action on m, the xed point equations
constrain the map x  to be a special lagrangean submanifold, and the u(1) gauge
connection living on the embedded 3-manifold to be at. in the previous section, we
saw that msl is parametrized by a torus t b1. it is also easy to see that the moduli
space of at u(1) connections on y is parametrized by a torus t b1. so the dimension
of the total moduli space m is 2b1. suppose m has a mirror fm . quantum mirror
symmetry then implies that the total moduli space m is nothing but the mirror
manifold fm , and b1 = 3 for the dimensions to match [11].

we conclude that for the u(1) gauge group, the path integral calculation of
the corresponding topological sigma model reduces to an integral over the mirror
manifold. the lagrangean of such a topological sigma model coupled to gauge elds
should in principle be obtainable starting from the lagrangean of super yang-mills
theory on a calabi-yau 3-fold [13] and then reducing it on to a 3d submanifold. we
hope to return to this point in future.

a. conventions and the proof of eq. (2.4)

in this appendix, using the conventions of [13], we derive equation (2.4).

let m be a calabi-yau 3-fold. as such, there exists a spinor  on m which is a
singlet under the holonomy group su(3). take  to be left-handed and normalize it
such that  = 1. let us choose a representation for the gamma matrices such that
they are hermitian and antisymmetric;  = ,  = ,  =  (where
 = 1

2{, }). thus

7 =  ,
7 =  ,

7 = 
t7 = t ,

(a.1)

 and  are left-handed while  and t are right-handed spinors. this in particular
implies that

also, it is easy to see that  = 0. we dene

 =  = 0 .

k = i

 =  .

(a.2)

as  is a singlet under the holonomy group, these are nowhere vanishing closed
forms. therefore we recognize k and  as the kahler and holomorphic 3-form on m,
respectively.
