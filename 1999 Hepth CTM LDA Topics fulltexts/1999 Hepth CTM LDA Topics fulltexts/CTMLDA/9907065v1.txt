abstract

in this paper we re-express the schouten-nijenhuis, the frolicher-nijenhuis and the
nijenhuis-richardson brackets on a symplectic space using the extended poisson
brackets structure present in the path-integral

formulation of classical mechanics.

1 introduction

some time ago a path-integral formulation of classical mechanics (cm) appeared in the
literature [1]. this formulation was nothing else than the path-integral counterpart of
the operatorial version of cm provided long ago by koopman and von neumann [2].
from now on we will refer to the formulation contained in ref. [1] as cpi for classical
path integral.

calling the phase-space of the system as m one had that in the cpi, besides the
2n phase-space variables: a = (q1    qn, p1    pn), the measure in the path-integral
contained a set of 6n auxiliary variables which were indicated as (a, ca, ca). all to-
gether these 8n variables (a, a, ca, ca) labelled a space whose geometrical meaning was
studied in ref. [3]. it turned to be what is called the cotangent bundle to the reversed-
parity tangent bundle to phase-space1, and is indicated in brief as t (t m). being
a cotangent bundle this space had a poisson structure which was called [1] extended
poisson brackets (or epb) to distinguish it from the standard poisson brackets dened
on the phase-space m. via these epb and the 8n variables indicated above it was
shown [1] that all the standard variables (forms, multivectors, etc) could be mapped
into functions of our 8n variables and the standard operations (exterior derivative, in-
terior contraction, lie-brackets, lie-derivative, etc.) of the cartan calculus [4] could
be obtained by inserting those functions into chains of epb.

what had not been mapped into this formalism of the cpi and of the epb were
those generalizations of the lie-brackets known [5][8] as the schouten-nijenhuis (sn)
brackets, the frolicher-nijenhuis (fn) brackets and the richardson-nijenhuis (rn)
ones. in this paper we will derive the above mentioned mapping for these backets.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec. 2 we will briey review the path integral
for classical mechanics (cpi) and explain the epb structure present there. in sec. 3
we will show how to do the cartan calculus via our variables and the associated epb
structure. in sec. 4 we will map the sn brackets, the fn brackets and the rn ones
into operations done with only the epb brackets with inserted dierent functions of
our variables. in appendix a we will report the main formulas of the cartan calculus
while the calculations of sec. 4 are given in details in appendices b, c and d.

2 path integral for classical mechanics (cpi)

the idea is to give a path integral for cm which will reproduce the operatorial version
of cm as given by the liouville operator [2] or by the lie derivative of the hamiltonian
ow [4]. we will be brief here because more details can be found in [1].

1for the denitions and meanings of these words we refer the reader to ref. [3].

1

let us start with a 2n-dimensional phase space m whose coordinates are indicated
as a(a = 1, . . . , 2n), i.e.: a = (q1    qn, p1    , pn). let us indicate the hamiltonian
of the system as h() and the symplectic-matrix as ab. the equations of motions are
then:

a = ab h
b

(1)

we shall now suggest, as path integral for cm, one that forces all paths in m to sit
on the classical ones. the classical analog zcm of the quantum generating functional
would be:

zcm[j] = nz d [(t)  cl(t)] expz j dt

(2)

and e[

where  are the a  m, cl are the solutions of eq.(1), j is an external current
] is a functional dirac-delta which forces every path (t) to sit on a classical
one cl(t). of course there are all possible initial conditions integrated over in (2).
one should be very careful in properly dening the measure and the functional dirac
delta. this careful analysis has been done in the literature [6] for stochastic evolution
equations and it applies to hamiltonian deterministic equations as well.

we should now check if the path integral of eq. (2) leads to the well known operatorial
formulation [2] of cm done via the liouville operator and the lie derivative. to do
that let us rst rewrite the functional dirac delta in (2) as:

[  cl] = [ a  abbh] det[a

b t  accbh]

where we have used the analog of the relation

(3)

(4)

[f (x)] =

[x  xi]

x (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xi
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) f

the determinant which appears in (3) is always positive and so we can drop the
] as a fourier

|. the next step is to insert (3) in (2) and write the [

modulus sign |
transform over some new variables a, i.e.:

(cid:20) a  ab h

b(cid:21) =z da exp iz a(cid:20) a  ab h
b(cid:21)dt

(5)

2

and to re-write the determinant det[a

b t  accbh] via grassmannian variables

ca, ca:

det[a

b t  accbh] =z dcadca exp z ca[a

b t  accbh]cb dt

inserting (5), (6) and (3) in (2) we get:

where el is:

zcm [0] =z dadadcadca exp (cid:20)iz dt el(cid:21)

el = a[ a  abbh] + ica[a

b t  accbh]cb

one can easily see that this lagrangian gives the following equations of motion:

(6)

(7)

(8)

a  abbh = 0
b t  accbh]cb = 0
[a
b tca + caaccbh = 0
a
[a
b t + accbh]a = icaaccdbhcd

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

one notices immediately the following two things:

2) cb transforms under the hamiltonian vector eld h  abbha as a form db does.
from the above formalism one can get the equations of motion (9)-(12) also via an

1) el leads to the same hamiltonian equations for  as h did;
hamiltonian fh:

(13)

fh = aabbh + icaac(cbh)cb

and via some extended poisson brackets (epb) dened in the space (a, ca, a, ca).

they are:

{a, b}ep b = a
b

; {cb, ca}ep b = ia
b

(14)

3

the equations of motion (9)-(12) are then reproduced via the formula d

where a is one of the variables (a, ca, a, ca). all the other epb are zero; in particular
{a, b}ep b = 0 and so these are not the standard poisson brackets on m which would
give {a, b}p b = ab.

dt a = {a,fh}ep b

being (7) a path integral one could also introduce the concept of commutator as
feynman did in the quantum case. if we dene the graded commutator of two functions
o1(t) and o2(t) as the expectation value h
i under our path integral of some time-
splitting combinations of the functions themselves, as:

h[o1(t), o2(t)]i  lim
0

ho1(t + )o2(t)  o2(t + )o1(t)i

(15)

then we get immediately from (7) that the only expressions dierent from zero are:

h[a, b]i = ia
b

;

h[cb, ca]i = a
b

(16)

we notice immediately two things:

1) there is an isomorphism between the extended poisson structure (14) and the graded
commutator structure (16): {, }ep b  i[, ];
2) via the commutator structure (16) one can realize a and ca as:

a = i



a

; ca =


ca

(17)

now, using (17), we can check that actually what we got as weight in (7) corresponds
to the operatorial version of cm. in fact take, for the moment, only the bosonic (b)

part of fh in (13):

fhb = aabbh

this one, via (17), goes into the operator:

cfhb  iabbha

(18)

(19)

which is the liouville operator of cm. if we had added the grassmannian part to

fhb and inserted the operatorial representation of c (17), we would have got the lie

derivative of the hamiltonian ow as we will see in the next section. so this proves
that the operatorial version of cm comes from a path-integral weight that is just a

4

dirac delta on the classical paths. somehow this is the classical anologue of what
feynman did for quantum mechanics where he proved that the schroedinger operator
of evolution comes from a path-integral weight of the form exp is.

3 cartan calculus

we have seen in sec. 2 that ca transform as da, that is as the basis of generic forms
  a()da or as the components of tangent vectors : v a() 
a . the space whose
coordinates are (a, ca) is called [7] reversed-parity tangent bundle, indicated as t m.
the reversed-parity specication is because the ca are grassmannian variables. as
the (a, ca) are the momenta of the previous variables (see eq. (19)), we conclude
that the 8n variables (a, ca, a, ca) span the cotangent bundle to the reversed-parity
tangent bundle [3]: t (t m). for more details about this we refer the interested
reader to ref. [3]. so our space is a cotangent bundle and this is the reason why it has
a poisson structure which is the one we found via the cpi and indicated in eq. (15).
in the remaining part of this section we will show how to reproduce all the abstract
cartan calculus via our epb and the grassmannian variables. let us rst introduce 5

charges which are conserved under the fh of eq. (13) and which will play an important

role in the cartan calculus. they are:

qbrs  icaa
qbrs  icaabb

qg  caca

k

abcacb

abcacb

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

where ab are the matrix elements of the inverse of ab. the next thing we should
observe is that ca transforms under the hamiltonian ow as the basis of vector elds,
see eq. (11), while a does not seem to transform as a vector eld, eq. (12), even if it
can be interpreted as


a . the explanation of this fact is given in ref. [3].

now since ca transforms as basis of forms da and ca as basis of vector elds2


a ,

let us start building the following map, called hat map :

2this is so not only under the hamiltonian ow but under any dieomorphism: see ref.

[3] for

details.

5

 = ada
v = v aa

 b  aca
 bv  v aca

(25)

(26)

it is actually a much more general map between forms , antisymmetric tensors v

and functions of , c, c:

f (p) =

1
p!

v (p) =

fa1apda1      dap

1

1
p!

fa1apca1    cap

v a1ap ca1    cap

(27)

(28)

 bf (p) 
 bv 

1
p!

once the correspondence (25)-(28) is extablished we can easily nd out what corre-
spond to the various cartan operations known as the exterior derivative d of a form,
or interior contraction between a vector eld v and a form f . it is easy to check that,
see [1]:

df (p)
v f (p)
pf (p)

 i{qbrs, bf (p)}ep b
 i{bv , bf (p)}ep b
 i{qg, bf (p)}ep b

(29)

(30)

(31)

where qbrs, qg are the charges of (20)-(22). at the same level we can translate in
our language the usual mapping [4] between vector elds v and forms v  realized by
the symplectic 2-form (v, 0)  v , or the inverse operation of building a vector eld
 out of a form:  = (). these operations can be translated in our formalism as
follows:

v 


 i{k, bv }ep b
 i{ k,b}ep b

(32)

(33)

where again k, k are the charges (23)-(24). we can also translate the standard
operation of building a vector eld out of a function f (), and also the poisson brackets
between two functions f and g:

6

(df )
{f, g}p b = df [(dg)]

 i{ qbrs, f }ep b
 {{{f, qbrs}, k}, {{{g, qbrs}, k}, k}}ep b

(34)

(35)

the next thing to do is to translate the concept of lie derivative which is dened

as: lv = dv + v d. it is easy to prove that:

lv f (p)

 {fhv , bf (p)}ep b

(36)

where fhv = av a + icabv acb; note that, for v a = abbh, fhv becomes the fh of
(13). this conrms that the full fh of eq. (13) is the lie derivative of the hamiltonian

ow as we said at the end of the previous section. finally the lie brackets between
two vector elds v, w are reproduced by:

[v, w ]liebrack.  {fhv ,cw }ep b

(37)

we will collect in appendix a all the important formulas we mentioned in this

section.

4 schouten-nijenhuis,

and
nijenhuis-richardson brackets done via the
extended poisson brackets

frolicher-nijenhuis

4.1 schouten-nijenhuis (sn) brackets

in fact
these brackets are a generalization of the lie brackets between vector elds:
the sn are brackets between multivector elds and they become the usual lie brackets
in case of vector elds. as lie brackets associate to two vector elds x and y an-
other vector eld [x, y ], so sn brackets associate to two multivector elds of rank p
(p = x(1)      x(p)) and r (r = y(1)      y(r)) a multivector eld of rank p + r  1
via the following rule [8]:

[, ]sn : v p(m)  v r(m)  v p+r1(m)

[p, r]sn 

pxi=1

(1)i+1x(1)     ccx (i)     x(p)  [x(i), r]

(38)

7

where the v s indicates the space of mutivector elds of rank s and the double hatccx (i)

indicates that we have removed the x(i), while [x(i), r] = lx(i)
of a multivector dened as:

r is the lie derivative

lx(i)r =

rxj=1

y1      [x(i), y(j)]      y(r)

(39)

this lie derivative is reproduced via our extended poisson brackets (epb) as:

lx(i)

r  {fhx(i)

, br}ep b

(40)

where we have dened: fhx(i) = {cx(i), qbrs}ep b. the sn brackets become then in

our notation :

[p, r]sn

  {fhp , br}ep b

where:

and:

fhp = {q,cx(1)   cx(p)} =

pxi=1

(1)i+1cx(1)   ccx (i)   cx(p)fhx(i)

(1)cj1    y jr

(r)cjr

br = y j1

(41)

(42)

(43)

the quantities which one has in the equations above are those written in terms of

ca or ca as explained in the previous section.

the extended poisson brackets (epb), besides allowing us to write complicated
formulas in a very compact way, can also be used to prove some properties of the
schouten-nijenhuis brackets, as we will show in appendix b.

4.2 frolicher-nijenhuis (fn) brackets

these are brackets which associate to two vector-valued forms3 k  k+1(m; t m) of
degree k + 1 and l  l+1(m; t m) of degree l + 1 a vector-valued form of degree

3the notation we follow, regarding the manner to indicate the space of vector valued forms with

k(m, t m ), is the one of ref. [5].

8

k + l + 2:

[, ]f n : k+1(m; t m)  l+1(m; t m)  k+l+2(m; t m)

(44)

they are dened in the following manner [5]:
a) let us rst dene the interior contraction k not with a vector eld but with a
vector-valued form k of degree k + 1, and apply it on a form  of degree l. as k is a
(k + 1)-form, k can eat k + l vector elds, i.e. when we apply k to k + l vectors,
we obtain the following number:

(k)(x(1),    , x(k+l)) 
1

(sign ) [k(x(1),    , x(k+1)), x(k+2),    , x(k+l)]



(k + 1)!(l  1)! x{sk+l}

(45)

where sk+l is the set of permutations of the k +l vector elds x(1)    x(k+l). we note
how the k + 1 vector-valued form k, acting on k + 1 vector elds, produces another
vector eld;

b) having dened this generalized interior product k, we can also dene a generalized

lie derivative as:

lk = [k, d]

(46)

where [, ] is the usual graded commutator and k  k+1(m; t m).
c) now, having done a) and b), the fn brackets are dened in the following implicit

way:

[lk, ll]  l[k,l]f n

(47)

where [lk, ll] is the usual graded commutator among lie derivatives.
now if k and l are written in our linguage as:

k

then the fn brackets become:

[k, l]f n   {fhk,bl}ep b

where:

the calculational details are given in appendix c.

4.3 nijenhuis-richardson (nr) brackets

they are brackets dened among two vector-valued forms: k  k+1(m; t m) and
l  l+1(m; t m) and they give a k + l + 1 vector-valued form dened in the following
implicit way:

[, ]n r : k+1(m; t m)  l+1(m; t m)  k+l+1(m; t m)

[k,l]n r  [k, l]

(51)

where k and l are the generalized interior contractions dened in the previous

section. the denition (51) can also be expressed in a more explicit way as:

[k, l]n r = kl  (1)kllk

now with our calculus and ck and bl dened as in (48) we can show that :

[k, l]n r

 i{ck,bl}ep b

(52)

(53)

the calculational details are provided in appendix d.
we can now summarize all sn, fn, nr brackets in the following very compact way:

5 conclusions

the reader may ask which is the use of all this. our answer is that by looking at eq.
(54) one immediately realizes that we have reduced three dierent and complicated
brackets, like the sn, fn and nr brackets, to only one bracket which is our extended
poisson bracket (or epb) in which the entries are dierent functions of our variables.
so instead of changing the brackets we just have to change the entries to reproduce all
the three sn, fn and nr brackets. this unifying structure is not only appealing but
it may also indicate something more profound which may be worth to investigate in
the future.

appendix b

calculational details regarding the sn brackets

we report here some more detailed calculations about the sn brackets and we follow
the book [8]. from now on all the curly brackets mean epb-brackets and q indicates
the brs charge that previously we indicated as qbrs. since we will use it widely, we
want rst to return to the formula regarding the lie brackets between two vector elds,
of which the sn brackets are only a generalization. as we have seen in (72) the correct
translation in our language of the lie brackets is

[v, w ]liebrack.

  {fhv ,cw }

in fact:

{fhv ,cw } = {av a + ica(bv a)cb, w ccc} =

= v accaw c  ca(bv a)w b = [v b(bw a)  w b(bv a)]ca

(73)

(74)

so we have obtained, correctly, a vector eld whose components are just the compo-

nents of the lie brackets between v aca and w aca, see [5].

next we extend the concept of interior contraction: the interior product between a

p-multivector eld p = x(1)      x(p) and an l-form  is dened as:

p (  ) = w(x(1), x(2),    , x(p),   )

(75)

now from the denition itself of interior product we have:

x(p1)    x(1)

x(p)
= x(p2)    x(1)

(  ) = x(p1)    x(1)

(x(p),   ) =

(x(p1), x(p),   ) =    = (x(1), x(2),    , x(p),   ) = p (  )
(76)

in this way we can transform the interior product with a multivector into a set of

interior contractions with normal vector elds:

p  = x(p)

x(p1)    x(2)

x(1)



(77)

13

let us remember that we know which is the -map of an interior contraction between

a form and a vector:

so, applying the previous formula over and over again, we obtain from (77) and (78):

v   i{bv ,b}

(78)

p   i{cx(p), (x(p1)    x(2)

= i2{x ip

(p)cip, {x ip1
(p)cip, {x ip1

{x ip

=

l!

x(1)

)} =

(p1)cip1, (x(p2)    x(2)

x(1)

)}} =    =

(p1)cip1, {   , {x i1

(1)ci1, ijlcicj    cl }}   }

(79)

p brackets

| {z }

one could have been tempted to make the -correspondence not with the rhs of

(79), but with something proportional to:

{x i1

(1)ci1x i2

(2)ci2    x ip

(p)cip, ijlcicj    cl}

(80)

but it would be wrong. in fact, while (79) is an (l  p)-form, that is a (l  p)-string

of c, (80) is not a string of only c.

now we notice that the interior contraction with a 2-vector can be expressed as
a combination of well-known objects, such as lie-brackets, exterior derivatives and
interior contractions with normal vector elds. in fact, according to our formalism, we
have:

v w dw   i{ w , { v , {q, }}}

(81)

where v and w are vector elds,  is a 1-form and q is the usual brs-charge.

using the jacobi identity, we can write:

 i{ w , { v , {q, }}} = i{ w , {q, { v , }}} + i{ w , {, {q, v }}}

(82)

the last term of (82) can be rewritten using again the jacobi identity:

+ i{ w , {, {q, v }}} = +i{, {{q, v }, w }}  i{{q, v }, { w , }}

(83)

14

let us now manipulate the last term of (83):

i{{q, v }, { w , }} = +i{{ w , }, { v , q}} =
i{ v , {q, { w , }}}  i{q, {{ w , }, v }}

(84)

the last term of (84) is identically zero, in fact:

{{ w , }, v } = {{w aca, bcb}, v dcd} = {iw aa, v dcd} = 0

(85)

collecting all the previous results in (81) we obtain:

v w dw  i{ w , {q, { v , }}} +
+i{{{q, v }, w }, }  i{ v , {q, { w , }}} =

=(cid:18)w d(v )  [v,w ] + v d(w )(cid:19)

(86)

so we have obtained the formula:

v w dw = w d(v )  [v,w ] + v d(w )

(87)

that can be generalized to the case of multivector elds; we can in fact express interior
contraction with a multivector eld using exterior derivatives, interior contractions with
multivectors of lower rank and the sn brackets according to the formula:

p rdw = rd(p )  [p,r]sn  + p d(r)

(88)

where p and r are multivector elds of rank p and r respectively and  is a
p + r  1 form. a proof of (88), that is the natural generalization of (87), can be
found in [9].

following [8], we can dene the schouten-nijenhuis brackets between two multivector
elds p = x(1)  x(2)      x(p) and r = y(1)  y(2)      y(r) as the (p + r  1)-
multivector eld given by:

15

[p, r]sn =

pxi=1

(1)i+1x(1)     ccx (i)      x(p)  [x(i), r]

(89)

where ccx (i) means x(i) is missing and where:

rxj=1

[x(i), r] = lx(i)

r =

y(1)      [x(i), y(j)]      y(r)

(90)

in the previous formula [x(i), y(j)] are the usual lie brackets between vector elds.
now (90), that is the lie derivative along a vector eld of a multivector, can be trans-
lated in our language as:

lx(i)

r  {fhx(i)

, br} = {{cx(i), q}, br}

in fact:

, by(1)by(2)    by(r)} = {fhx(i)

, by(2)}by(3)    by(r) +    + by(1)by(2)    by(r1){fhx(i)

, by(1)}by(2)   by(r) +
, by(r)} =

, br} = {fhx(i)

{fhx(i)
+by(1){fhx(i)
rxj=1 by(1)by(2)    ([x(i), y(j)])    by(r) = (lx(i)

=

r)

(91)

(92)

we note that the extended poisson brackets take automatically into account the sum

over j which appears in the denition of lie derivative of a multivector.

now we can cosider the sn brackets. according to their denition we have

[p, r]sn 

pxi=1

(1)i+1cx(1)   ccx (i)   cx(p){{cx(i), q}, br}

the previous formula can be written in a very compact way as:

[p, r]sn

  {{q, bp }, br}

in fact:

(93)

(94)

{{q, bp }, br} = {{q,cx(1)   cx(p)}, br} =

16

= {{q,cx(1)}cx(2)   cx(p), br} + {cx(1){q,cx(2)}cx(3)   cx(p), br}     =
= {ccx (1)cx(2)   cx(p){q,cx(1)}, br} + {cx(1)ccx (2)   cx(p){q,cx(2)}, br}     =
pxi=1

()i+1cx(1)   ccx (i)   cx(p){{q,cx(i)}, br} = [p, r]

=

sn

(95)

so we dont need any sum or any strange factor if we use the epb brackets to
represent the sn brackets. on the rhs of (94) we have the images, via the -map,
of the multivectors p and r, which appear on the lhs of the same equation, and the
usual brs charge q that appears naturally also in this context.

like in the case of vector elds, where fhx = {cx, q} = {q,cx}, we can also dene

a sort of hamiltonian associated with a multivector in the following way:

fhp = {q,cx(1)   cx(p)} =

pxi=1

(1)i+1cx(1)   ccx (i)   cx(p)fhx(i)

in this way we can nally write:

[p, r]sn

  {fhp , br}

(96)

(97)

from the expressions (96) and (97) we also notice how the sn brackets become the

usual lie brackets in case of vector elds.

besides this, we can use the properties of the epb and of grassmannian variables
to demonstrate immediately some other properties, or alternative denitions, of the
schouten-nijenhuis brackets. if we start from (93) and we take into account the de-
nition of lie derivative of a multivector, we obtain:

[p, r]sn 

pxi=1
(1)i+1cx(1)   ccx (i)   cx(p){fhx(i)

, br}

=

pxi=1

rxj=1
(1)i+1cx(1)   ccx (i)   cx(p)by(1)    by(j1)([x(i), y(j)])    by(r)

(98)

remembering that the lie bracket of two vector elds is a vector eld (and so it is

grassmannian odd in our language) we can write:

[p, r]sn 

pxi=1

rxj=1
(1)i+j+p+1([x(i), y(j)])cx(1)   ccx (i)   cx(p)by(1)    bby (j)    by(r)

17

= (1)p+1

pxi=1
rxj=1
(1)i+j[x(i), y(j)]  x(1)     ccx (i)      x(p)  y(1) 
     bby (j)      y(r)!

(99)

in the same way we can start from the last equation and we can use properties of

grassmannian variables to obtain the formula:

[p, r]sn 

= (1)pr

 (1)pr

pxi=1
rxj=1
(1)i+jby(1)    bby (j)    by(r)[y(j), x(i)]cx(1)   ccx (i)   cx(p) =
pxi=1
rxj=1
(1)i+jby(1)   bby (j)    by(r)
(1)i1cx(1)    ([y(j), x(i)])   cx(p) =
(1)j+1y(1)      bby (j)      y(r)(lyj p )!
= (1)pr
rxj=1

(100)

in this way we have obtained two other properties of the sn brackets that may be
considered as alternative denitions of the brackets themselves, as one can see from
[8].

appendix c

calculational details regarding the fn brackets

in this section we will handle vector-valued forms k  k+1(m; t m). usually we
indicate (k + 1)-forms with k+1(m), but when we indicate in  also t m we mean
vector-valued forms. via our -map k becomes:

k 

1

(k + 1)!

k i

i1i2ik+1 [ci1ci2    cik+1][ci]

(101)

following [5] we can introduce the interior product between vector-valued forms and
usual forms . if k  k+1(m; t m) and   l(m), then k is a (k + l)-form, so it
can eat multivectors of degree k + l and it is dened as:

(k)[x(1),    , x(k+l)] 

(102)

1

(k + 1)!(l  1)! x{sk+l}

sign  [k(x(1),    , x(k+1)), x(k+2),    , x(k+l)]

which is the -map of k? we expect, as in the case of interior contraction with

vector elds, that:

k  i{ck,b}

(103)

but we have to control that (103) is in accordance with the general denition (102).

if k =   x then we can rewrite (102) in the following way:

(k)[x(1),    , x(k+l)] 

1

1

sign  [(x(1),    , x(k+1))x, x(k+2),    , x(k+l)] =

sign  (x(1),    , x(k+1))[x, x(k+2),    , x(k+l)] =

sign  (x(1),    , x(k+1))x[x(k+2),    , x(k+l)] =



=

=

1

(k + 1)!(l  1)! x{sk+l}
(k + 1)!(l  1)! x{sk+l}
(k + 1)!(l  1)! x{sk+l}

=   x(x(1),    , x(k+l))

(104)

19

where   k+1(m) and x  l1(m). from the previous equalities we deduce
that we can translate the interior contraction between a form and a vector-valued form
as the exterior product between two forms:

k =   x

(105)

now we want to prove that, if   k+1(m) and   l1(m) are two dierential

forms, we can represent their exterior product as:

the denition of the exterior product of dierential forms is:

(  )

 bb

  (x(1),    , x(k+l)) 

(106)

(107)



1

(k + 1)!(l  1)! x{sk+l}

sign  (x(1),    , x(k+1))(x(k+2),    , x(k+l))

we can start translating via the -map the rhs of (107):

(x(1),    , x(k+1)) = x(k+1)    x(1)
 ik+1{x jk+1

(k+1)cjk+1{   , {x j1

 

(1)cj1,b }}   }
| {z }

k+1 brackets

=

(108)

=

1

(k + 1)! x{ sk+1}

sign  x jk+1

(k+1)    x j1

(1) (j1) (jk+1) = x jk+1

(k+1)    x j1

(1)j1jk+1

in the last passage we have employed the fact that  (j1) (jk+1) = sign  j1jk+1
and that the number of permutations in sk+1 is just (k + 1)!. in the same way we have:

(x(k+2),    , x(k+l))  x jk+l

(k+l)    x jk+2

(k+2)jk+2jk+l

(109)

so, from the denition itself of exterior product, we must have:

  (x(1),    , x(k+l))



1

(k + 1)!(l  1)! x{sk+l}

sign  x jk+l

(k+l)    x jk+2

(k+2) 

x jk+1

(k+1)    x j1

(1)j1jk+1jk+2jk+l

(110)

20

now we can say that (106) is correct if it reproduces (110). so we have to evaluate:

  (x(1),    , x(k+l)) 

1

(k + 1)!(l  1)!

ik+l{x ik+l

(k+l)cik+l, {   , {x i1

(1)ci1,

j1jk+1cj1    cjk+1jk+2jk+lcjk+2    cjk+l }}   }

=

=

=

1

(k + 1)!(l  1)! x{sk+l}
(k + 1)!(l  1)! x{sk+l}

1

k+l brackets

| {z }

   x (j1)

sign  x (jk+l)

(k+l)

(1) j1jk+1jk+2jk+l =

sign  x jk+l

(k+l)    x j1

(1)j1jk+1jk+2jk+l

(111)

the last terms of (110) and (111) are equal; so we can conclude that the correct

rappresentation via -map of    is just bb.

k. in fact:

at this point we have all the elements to translate in our language the operation

k =   x  b(x)

using (65) and the fact that {b,b} = 0 we can go on writing:
b(x) = ib{cx,b} = i{bcx,b} = i{ck,b}

so, as we had expected, we have proved that:

k

 i{ck,b}

(112)

(113)

(114)

at this point, having dened the concept of interior contraction with a vector-valued
form, we can go on introducing the lie derivative associated with a vector valued form
k:

lk = [k, d] = kd + (1)k+1dk

(115)

since we know how to translate in our language both the interior contraction and

the exterior derivative, we can write:

21

lk  i{ck, (d)} + (1)k+1i{q, (k)} =
= {ck, {q,b}} + (1)k{q, {ck,b}} = {{ck, q},b}

where, in the last step, we have used the jacobi identity. so we have:

(116)

(117)

lk   {fhk,e}

where we have dened, as usual, fhk = {ck, q}. from the denition itself and
making use of (101) it follows that the explicit expression of fhk is:

cd)!cj1    cjk+1

(118)

1

(k + 1)! jk j

fhk =

j1j2jk+1 + icj(dk j

j1j2jk+1

from the previous expression we note that if k is even then fhk is grassmannian
odd and if k is odd fhk is even. moreover, from (117), the grassmannian parity of fhk

coincides with that of the correspondent lie derivative lk.

finally we have all the elements to translate in our language the frolicher-nijenhuis

brackets. they are dened [5] in implicit way from the equation:

[lk, ll] = l[k,l]f n

now if we think of lhs of (119) as applied on a generic form  we have:

[lk, ll] = (lkll)  (1)[ehl][ehk ](lllk)

(119)

(120)

where we indicate with [(  )] the grassmannian parity of (  ). via our mapping we

have:

[lk, ll]  {fhk, {fhl,b}}  (1)[ehl][ehk ]{fhl, {fhk,b}} =
= {fhk, {fhl,b}} + (1)[ehk ]([ehl]+[]){fhl, {,fhk}} = {{fhk,fhl},b} (121)

where in the last step we have used, as usual, the jacobi identity. the rhs of (119)

can be translated as:

22

l[k,l]f n    {fh[k,l]f n , }

(122)

so, from the comparison of (121) and (122), we have the following important relation:

now, if we want to have the correct representation of the fn brackets, we have to

fh[k,l]f n = {([k, l]f n), q} = {fhk,fhl}
write {fhk,fhl} as {(), q}. this is not dicult to do, in fact:
{fhk,fhl} = {{{ck, q},bl}, q}

(123)

(124)

to demonstrate (124) we can start from its rhs and employ the jacobi identity:

{{{ck, q},bl}, q} = {{fhk,bl}, q} = {fhk,fhl}  (1)k+l{{q,fhk}, l}
so (124) is proved if {q,fhk} = 0. but this is easy to demonstrate, since every brs

exact term has zero epb with q. in fact:

(125)

{q,fhk} = {q, {ck, q}}

the jacobi identity in this case is:

{q, {ck, q}} + {q, {ck, q}} + {ck, {q, q}} = 0

from the nilpotency of q we can conclude that:

{q, {ck, q}} = {q,fhk} = 0

and so (124) is proved. substituting (124) into (123) we obtain nally:

[k, l]f n  = {fhk,bl}

23

(126)

(127)

(128)

(129)

from the previous expression we notice how, if k and l are zero vector-valued forms,
i.e.
if they are vector elds, then the fn brackets reduce to the usual lie brackets.
in a certain sense we can say that, as the sn brackets generalize lie brackets in the
case of multivector elds, so the fn brackets generalize the lie brackets in the case of
vector-valued forms.

24

appendix d

calculational details regarding the nr brackets

the nijenhuis-richardson brackets are dened between two vector-valued forms:
k  k+1(m; t m) and l  l+1(m; t m) and they give a vector-valued form of
degree k + l + 1 dened [5] in an implicit way as:

[k,l]n r  [k, l]

(130)

if we apply a generic form   m(m) on the lhs of (130) then, via our -map, it

becomes:

[k,l]n r

 i{([k, l]n r),b}

(131)

while the rhs of (130) becomes:

[k, l] = k(l)  (1)kll(k)  i{ck, (l)}  (1)kli{bl, (k)} =
{ck, {bl,b}} + (1)kl{bl, {ck,b}}

(132)

using the jacobi identity we obtain:

[k, l]

  {{ck,bl},b}

we can write, from the comparison of (131) with (133):

[k, l]n r

 i{ck,bl}

(133)

(134)

so the nr brackets between two vector-valued forms are just proportional to the

extended poisson brackets of the vector-valued forms themselves.

now we can use properties of the extended poisson brackets to nd a more explicit

denition of nr brackets, in fact:

i

(l + 1)!(k + 1)!

i{ck,bl} =

{k i

i1ik+1

ci1    cik+1ci, lj

j1jl+1

cj1    cjl+1cj} =

25

=

i

(l + 1)!

j1jl+1

cj1    cjl+1}cj +

i

(l + 1)!(k + 1)!

lj

j1jl+1

cj1    cjl+1

{k i

i1ik+1

ci1    cik+1 ci, cj}(1)(l+1)k =

j1jl+1

cj1    cjl+1}cj +

{ck, lj

i

(l + 1)!

{ck, lj



=

i

(l + 1)!(k + 1)!

lj

j1jl+1

cj1    cjl+1{cj, k i

i1ik+1

ci1    cik+1}ci(1)lk =

i

(l + 1)!

j1jl+1

{ck, lj

cj1    cjl+1}cj  (1)lk

i

(k + 1)!

i1ik+1

{bl, k i

ci1    cik+1}ci

(135)

since k(  x)  k()  x we can write:

i{ck,bl} = (kl)  (1)lk(lk)

from the comparison of (134) with (136) we obtain:

[k, l]n r = kl  (1)kllk

(136)

(137)

that can be interpreted as a more explicit denition of nr brackets (see also [5]).
