abstract

quantization of a system constrained to move on a sphere is considered
by taking a square root of the on sphere condition. we arrive at the bre
bundle structure of the hopf map in the cases of s2 and s4. this leads to
more geometrical understanding of monopole and instanton gauge structures
that emerge in the course of quantization.

1 quantum constraints to the sphere `a la dirac

quantum mechanics, where the sphere sn embedded in rn+1 is considered as
a conguration space, has been studied in [1] [2][3][4] and the gauge elds were
seen to emerge at the quantum level, which in turn specify the inequivalent
quantizations that are possible on the sphere. the authors of these papers,
generalizing the conventional canonical commutation relations, set up as a
fundamental algebra, the lie algebra of the euclidean group e(n + 1)
in (n + 1) dimensional space, which is given by the semidirect product of
so(n + 1) and rn+1. then they obtain the representation of the group using
the wigners technique which allows them to construct the representation of
e(n + 1) in terms of the irreducible representation of the little group so(n)
 the isometry group of so(n + 1)  acting on sn. finally they show that a
particle on sn couples to a gauge potential covariantly through the generator
of the wigner rotation and that it is related to the induced gauge eld of
the (generally) nonabelian monopole located at the center of sn.

the induced gauge elds were then shown [5] to be nothing but the h-
connections, i.e. the gauge elds that emerge when we consider quantum
mechanics on the coset space g/h, which were thoroughly studied in [6].
these authors consider the system of a free particle on g/h, which in the
case of sphere is so(n + 1)/so(n) , and working within the framework of
mackeys quantization scheme [7] have shown that the hamiltonian on g/h
involves the induced h-connection.

in this paper we reconsider this problem, i.e. quantum mechanics on s2
and s4, from somewhat dierent point of view. namely we consider , `a
la dirac, a square root of the on sphere constraint. the results are not
dierent, of course, from those obtained in the above mentioned approaches,
however, we hope to gain a deeper insight into the problem.

2 quantum mechanics on s2

let us start with s2. as our sphere s2 is embedded in the space r3, it is
dened by the constraint

~x2 = a2

(1)

among the coordinates ~x = (x1, x2, x3) in the r3. naive denition of the
quantum mechanics on s2 is simply to restrict these variables to satisfy the
constraint ~x2 = a2 and to require the momentum operators to be compatible
with the constraint in their hamiltonian and the wave function. which

2

means that in the coordinate representation

i


t

[ (x)]s 2 = h h (x)is 2

,

(2)

where [ ]s 2 is the restriction of the variables on the constraint surface s2 :
~x2 = a2. this means that for a free particle

h h (x)is 2

= (cid:20)
= 

1
2m
1
2m

2

xixi  (x)(cid:21)s 2
gabab [ (x)]s 2 ,

(3)

where a and a denote the derivative and the covariant derivative with
respect to the coordinate qa and the metric gab on s2 . as a result we have
the hamiltonian

h = 

1
2m

gabab ,

(4)

which acts on the wave function  (q) = [ (x)]s 2 .

in this paper we propose a new denition of the quantum mechanics on

s2 replacing (1) by the quantum constraint on the wave function

this leads to

(~x  ~  a)  (~x) = 0 .

(5)

(6)

(~x  ~ + a) (~x  ~  a)  (~x) = 0
(cid:0)(~x  ~)2  a2(cid:1)  (~x) = 0
(cid:0)~x2  a2(cid:1)  (~x) = 0 ,

thus the constraint ~x2  a2 = 0 follows from the condition (5). here s are
the pauli matrices. dening

eq.(5) is rewritten as

  (~x  ~  a) ,

 = (cid:18) x3  a

x1 + ix2 x3  a (cid:19)  = 0 .

x1  ix2

(7)

(8)

in order for this equation to have a non-trivial solution it has to be degenerate
and the determinant should vanish

det  = (cid:0)~x2  a2(cid:1) = 0 .

3

(9)

we dene v by

v = 0 ,
vv = 1 ,

where v is 2  1 matrix or eigenvector of  whose eigenvalue is 0.

the explicit form of v can be written as

v =

1

the general solution of eq.(8) can be written as

p2a (a + x3) (cid:18) a + x3

x1 + ix2 (cid:19) .

 = v ,

(10)

(11)

(12)

with  an arbitrary complex function on s2. thus the solution to the con-
straint is the space projected by p

p  =  ,

(13)

where the projection operator p to the space spanned by v is dened as

p  vv ,
p 2 = vvvv = p ,
p v = v .

(14)

although  lives in this projected space, its derivative  does not necessarily
live in this space. then our interest is concerned with the projected derivative
p  i.e.

where

p  = vv (v)

= vv (v + v)
= vd ,

d   + a ,
a  vv .

(15)

(16)

it is noticed here that the gauge connection is induced as a result of this
projection. it is also obvious that for any polynomial f () of 

f (p )  = vf (d)  .

(17)

4

we dene the quantum mechanics on s2 by this projection

i


t

[ (x)]s 2 = (cid:20) h (cid:18)x, ip



x(cid:19)  (x)(cid:21)s 2

.

as a result we have the hamiltonian

h = 

1
2m

gab (a + aa) (b + ab) ,

which acts on the wave function  (q) = [ (x)]s 2 .

here a can be written as

a  vdv =

i

2a (a + x3)

(x1dx2  x2dx1) ,

(18)

(19)

(20)

and this is the induced magnetic monopole gauge potential obtained in [1][5].

3 quantum mechanics on s4

let us turn our discussion to quantum mechanics on s4, which is a rather
straightforward generalization of the arguments given above.

the coordinates are

which are restricted by

we choose

xm = (x0, x1, x2, x3, x5) ,

xm xm  a2 = 0 .

m = (cid:0)0, 1, 2, 3, 5(cid:1) ,
1 0 (cid:19) , ~ =(cid:18) 0
0 = (cid:18) 0 1
~ = (cid:0)1, 2, 3(cid:1) ,

which satisfy

i~

0

i~ 0 (cid:19) , 5 = (cid:18) 1

0 1 (cid:19) ,

then our quantum constraint is

(cid:8)m , n (cid:9) = 2m n ,

(cid:0)xm m  a(cid:1)  (x) = 0 .

5

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

this implies

thus the constraint

(cid:0)xn n + a(cid:1)(cid:0)xm m  a(cid:1)  (x) = 0 ,
(cid:0)xm xm  a2(cid:1)  (x) = 0 ,

xm xm  a2 = 0

follows from the condition (25). explicitly, our quantum constraint is

x0  i~x  ~ x5  a (cid:19)    = 0 .
(cid:18) x5  a

x0 + i~x  ~

(26)

(27)

(28)

it should be noticed that the rank of the 44 matrix  is 2 and the degree
of the freedom of  is 2. the general solution of the constraint equation is

where

and

v =

using the variables

 = v ,

1

p2a (a + x5) (cid:18) a + x5

x0  i~x  ~ (cid:19) ,

vv = 1[22] .

z  x0  i~x  ~ ,
z  x0 + i~x  ~ ,

the induced gauge eld is expressed as

a  vdv =

1
2

1

2a (a + x5) (cid:0)zdz  dzz(cid:1) ,

which is the instanton gauge connection. in more familiar terms as

z  x ,
  (1, i~) ,

z  x ,
 = (1, i~) ,

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

we have

where

(cid:0)zdz  dzz(cid:1) = xdx  dxx

we nally arrive at

 =  .

a = i

1

2a (a + x5)

xdx

(36)

(37)

(38)

which is the instanton gauge connection discussed in [8] [9]. the projection
operator in this case is

p = vv
1

=

2a (cid:18) a + x5
x0  i~x  ~

a  x5 (cid:19) ,
x0 + i~x  ~

and we have of course

p  = vd .

4 summary and discussion

(39)

(40)

we have seen in this paper that quantum mechanics on s2 and on s4 can
be reformulated by using the quantum constraint, which is, in a sense,
a square root of the usual constraint ~x2 = a2 . emergence of the induced
gauge elds (monopoles in r3 or two dimensional cp 1 instantons on s2, yang
monopoles in r5 or instantons on s4 ) can be attributed to the structure of
projection operator.

we can read o from the wave function

which can be rewritten as

 = v ,

z = v : (z z =  = 1) ,

the structure of the s3  s2 (s7  s4) hopf bering[10][11], where z stands
for the ber bundle s3 (s7), v denotes the section s2 (s4) and nally  is
the ber u(1) (su(2)).

quantum mechanics on the odd dimensional spheres can be considered
as a reduction of the higher dimensional spheres, for example the s3 case can
be obtained from the s4 case by simply setting x5 = 0 and we are left with
the induced meron gauge eld[12].

finally a few comments as to the relation of our approach with that of
the coset space g/h are in order. there is not so much dierence as far as
the quantum mechanics on s2 is concerned, however, the views seem rather
dierent on s4. the structure of the ber bundle looks dierent in these two
approaches, in our case it is not a group, has a simpler structure and can be
considered as a reduction of the former.

it is also interesting to note that our projection operator p (36) in the
case of s4 is related to that of adhm [13][14][15][16] construction of the
instanton solutions to the yang-mills gauge theory in its simplest case. the
s2 projection operator on the other hand and particularly v (11) plays a
crucial role in nding the instanton solution to the cp 1- model.
