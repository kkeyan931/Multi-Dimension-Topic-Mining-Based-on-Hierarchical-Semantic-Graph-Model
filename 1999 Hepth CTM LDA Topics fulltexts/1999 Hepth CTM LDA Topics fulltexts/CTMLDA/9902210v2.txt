abstract

we write supersymmetry preserving conditions for innite m5-
branes intersecting on a (3+1)-dimensional space. in contrast to pre-
viously known solutions, these intersections are completely localized.
we solve the equations for a particular class of congurations which
in the near-horizon decoupling limit are dual to nf = 2nc seiberg-
witten superconformal eld theories with gauge group su(n ) and
generalisations to su(n )n. we also discuss the relationship to d3-
branes in the presence of an ak singularity.

1 introduction

a recent conjecture due to maldacena [1] asserts that gauge theories realized
as worldvolume theories of branes can be described equivalently as gravity
theories in the near-horizon geometry due to these branes. a precise corre-
spondence between problems in gauge theory and problems in gravity has
been elucidated in [2, 3].

one interesting eld of application is four-dimensional conformal eld
theories. of particular importance is the n = 4 su(n) system realized by
parallel d3-branes in type iib string theory. its near-horizon geometry is
ads5  s5. a number of other conformal eld theories with less supersym-
metry have been constructed by employing various techniques [4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. the near-horizon geometry due to the branes is of
the form ads5  m where m is a compact manifold. the isometries of the
near-horizon geometry are realized as global symmetries of the world-volume
gauge theory of the branes. in particular, the ads factor is a signature of
conformal invariance of the world-volume gauge theory since its isometry
group is the conformal group of the eld theory living at its boundary.

in this paper we study n = 2 superconformal eld theories. we rst
describe the conditions for supersymmetry-preserving congurations of 5-
branes in 11-dimensional supergravity. this will allow us to write down
the general form of the metric describing 5-branes with worldvolume ir4 
 preserving at least one quarter of the maximum supersymmetry. this
corresponds to n = 2 supersymmetry in 4 dimensions. we will then show
how a specic conguration of this form reduces to a hanany-witten brane
conguration [16] in 10-dimensional type iia [17], realising a 4-dimensional
conformal eld theory. this conguration is special in that it receives no
non-perturbative corrections and so one can safely describe the system in
type iia. we are able to solve the equations only when the ns5-branes are
smeared in one direction. this smearing is typical of known congurations of
intersecting branes, [18, 19, 20] and references therein. see also [21, 22, 23]
for recent work on localised intersections. however, our method allows, in
principle, the construction of fully localised solutions. we will take the near-
horizon limit of this supergravity solution which should be the maldacena
dual of the conformal eld theory. we show that the space is of the form
ads5  m as expected. the compact manifold m has the isometry group
so(3)u(1) matching the r-symmetry group of the eld theory, there is also
an additional u(1) due to the smearing. this last u(1) should disappear in

1

the fully localized solution.

in addition we write down explicitly the t-dual [24, 25] (see also [26,
27, 28]) geometry in type iib. this geometry describes d3-branes in the
presence of an a1 ale singularity. this parallels the recent discussions
of d3-branes at conifold singularities [10, 12] which is t-dual to ns5- and
d4-brane congurations [29, 30, 31] with n = 1 supersymmetry in four
dimensions.

2 preservation of supersymmetry

in this section we will discuss the conditions on the metric and 4-form f for
a supersymmetry-preserving solution of 11-dimensional supergravity.
it is
known that a conguration preserving some supersymmetry will always be
a solution of the classical equations of motion provided the bianchi identity
and equations of motion for f are satised. so we will start by analysing the
restrictions imposed by the requirement that we preserve (in our case one
quarter) supersymmetry. this is essentially a bps condition and so ensures
that the equations of motion are satised. we will then supplement the
resulting conditions with the additional constraints on f .

the susy variation of the gravitino rarita-schwinger eld m is:

m = (cid:18)m +

(1)

in order to nd supersymmetric solutions we should choose the metric and
the 4-form f so that:

for some  where in our conventions:

m = 0

(10)  0123456789

(2)

(3)

we want a solution which corresponds to an m5-brane with worldvolume
ir4 with  being a 2-cycle holomorphically embedded in c2 with complex
coordinates (v, s). i.e.  is specied as the zero of a holomorphic function
f (v, s). we can also consider several 5-branes by taking  to be a sum of
disconnected holomorphic 2-cycles. the metric should be symmetric under
4d lorentz transformations and rotations in the three transverse directions.

2

if we pick a complex structure in the x4, x5, x6, x7 directions and assume that
the metric is hermitian in this subspace, the most general metric consistent
with the above symmetries is of the form:

ds2 = h1dxdx + 2gmndzmdzn + h2dxdx

(4)

where (middle) greek indices ,  etc. correspond to m = 0, 1, 2, 3 and
(beginning) greek indices ,  etc. correspond to m = 8, 9, 10. the two
complex variables are dened by zv = v = x4 + ix5 and zs = s = x6 + ix7.

h1, h2 and gmn are arbitrary functions of v, v, s, s and r = qxx. for

later convenience we will also dene the rescaled complex metric:

gmn = h 1

1 gmn

(5)

in order to recover minkowski space far from any sources we must have

asymptotically:

h1  1
h2  1
1
gvv 
2
1
gss 
2
gvs  0
gsv  0

(6)
(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)
(11)

we now wish to analyse the condition for preserving supersymmetry.
for a 5-brane with worldvolume ir4  , the number of supersymmetries
preserved is given by the number of spinors  which satisfy [32, 33, 34, 35]:

det hd1d2 = 0123mn(1z m2z n  1z m2z n)d1d2

(12)

where hij is the pullback of the spacetime metric gmn onto , i are the two
(real) worldvolume coordinates on  and z m(1, 2) are the target space
coordinates of . now on  we have f (z v, z s) = 0 so:

we can now evaluate the determinant of hij = (iz mj)z ngmn as:

iz s = vf (sf )1iz v

(13)

det h = i([1z v2]z v)

gvv  vf

sf!gvs 

3

vf
sf

gsv +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

vf

sf(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

gss
 (14)

so the equation for preservation of supersymmetry becomes:

0123
vv   vf
= ic
gvv   vf

sf!vs 
sf!gvs 

vf
sf

vf
sf

2

vf

sf(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
sv +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
gsv +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
sf(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

vf

2

ss
 
gss
 

(15)

where c = 1 corresponding to a brane or anti-brane. so we end up with
the conditions that the spinor  must satisfy:

0123mn = icgmn

(16)

or equivalently

0123ab = icab

(17)
2 in our conventions 1. this
4 of the supersymmetry

where ab is the at space metric with 11 = 1
restriction on  means that the solution will preserve 1
which corresponds to n = 2 in four dimensions.
using these equations we can express the terms on the right hand side of
equation (1) in terms of a sum of linearly-independent products of gamma
matrices acting on . the coecients of these terms must then vanish and
this will give us a set of equations which must be satised for a solution
preserving 1

4 of the supersymmetry.

it is straightforward to express equation (1) as a sum of independent prod-
ucts of -matrices and we will only present the nal results here. requiring
the coecient of each term to vanish we get a large number of equations
which can be reduced to the following set of independent equations:

h2 = (4g)

(24)

1we use a, b etc. with values 1 and 2 for the at space complex coordinates while m, n

etc. with values v and s are the curved space complex coordinate indices.

4

with all other types of components of f vanishing. the last two equations
are simply the statement that gmn is a kahler metric. clearly the full metric
and 4-form f are determined explicitly by the kahler metric.

now to ensure that the equations of motion of 11-dimensional supergrav-
ity are satised we only need to satisfy the bianchi identity and equations
of motion for f . this will give us the equations to determine gmn. we note
that f  f = 0 for above f . using the above relations it is easy to verify
that the bianchi identity for the dual 7-form f :

d  f = 0

(25)

is automatically satised and we have the equations of motion with source
term:

df = jmndzm  dzn  dx8  dx9  dx10,

where j is the source for f , leading to the following equations:

jmn =

ic
2

(4mn(2g) + gmn)

(26)

(27)

2.1 simple example

we can now check that we reproduce the solution for a single m5-brane with
worldvolume 012345. let

gvv =

gss =

1
2
1
2
gvs = 0
gsv = 0

h

then equations (27) reduce to:

jss =

ic
4

(4ss + )h

(28)

(29)

(30)
(31)

(32)

where the source term is just a delta function dening the position of the
m5-brane, normalised as:

jss = ic23l3

p(3)(r)(2)(s)

(33)

5

so h is a solution of the 5-dimensional laplace equation with a source at the
position of the 5-brane. so we nd:

h = 1 +

l3
p
r3
(5)

(34)

where r(5) is the radial coordinate in the 5 dimensions transverse to the 5-
brane. it is easy to see this reproduces the solution given in [18, 36]. of course
this solution will preserve 1
2 of the full supersymmetry since it describes only
one at m5-brane.

2.2 summary of general solution

what we have shown is that given a kahler metric gmn on a complex 2-
dimensional space which satises the source equations:

jmn =

ic
2

(4mn(2g) + gmn)

(35)

there exists a solution to the equations of motion of 11-dimensional super-
gravity preserving at least one quarter of the full supersymmetry. the 4-form
f is dened explicitly in terms of gmn by equations (20)(22). the metric is
given by:

ds2 = h  1

3 dxdx + 2h  1

3 gmndzmdzn + h

where:

h = 4g = 4(gvvgss  gvsgsv)

2

3 dxdx

(36)

(37)

the boundary conditions, equations (8)(11), for minkowski space at innity
become simply:

1
gvv 
2
1
gss 
2
gvs  0
gsv  0

(38)

(39)

(40)
(41)

we can combine the kahler conditions and the source equations into

equations determining the kahler potential k. the metric is dened as:

gmn = mnk

(42)

6

and the kahler potential is determined by:

ic
2

mn(8g(k) + k) = jmn.

(43)

these equations are similar to the monge-ampere equation and the general
solution is not known.
it would be possible to nd general solutions nu-
merically but we will not pursue that approach here. it is also possible to
solve asymptotically around at minkowski spacetime which would be valid
far from the branes. however, we are interested in the near-horizon limit
and in the next section we will show the solution in this limit for a special
conguration of branes corresponding to the description of conformal qcd.
we note that even without solving equations (43), the general form of
the solution exhibits the r-symmetry group appropriate for n = 2 yang-
mills in four dimensions. the overall transverse 3-space clearly has an so(3)
isometry group and there is also a u(1) isometry for the superconformal
case, since k depends on v only through its absolute value in this case, as
we see below. so as expected the global r-symmetry of the gauge theory is
manifested as the group of isometries of the metric.

it can be checked that our solution generalises previous solutions for m5-
branes intersecting orthogonally with a common (3+1)-dimensional worldvol-
ume (and related congurations in lower dimensions.) indeed if we choose
gvs = gsv = 0 then the kahler conditions tell us that gvv is independent of
s and s while gss is independent of v and v. it is then easy to show that
equations (27) are equivalent to the curved space laplace equations in [37].
it is important to also keep in mind the allowed coordinate dependence of the
functions, imposed in our case by the kahler condition. this is equivalent
to the additional constraints on the harmonic functions, derived in [38]. it
is easy to see that this ansatz is too restictive to allow solutions for fully
localised intersecting branes  at least one of the branes must be smeared
in some directions. our general solution for this type of brane conguration
does allow fully localised branes to intersect. the important generalisation
seems to be the inclusion of non-diagonal terms in the metric, i.e. we must
have non-zero gvs and gsv. the explicit construction of such a solution re-
quires the solution of equations (43) with appropriate fully localised sources.
unfortunately we have so far been unable to nd such a solution and this
matter is currently under investigation [39].

3 near-horizon limit of solution in 10 dimen-

sions

we want to consider the case of 2 parallel ns5-branes with worldvolume
012345 and n innite d4-branes with worldvolume 01236 in type iia. this
is the hanany-witten construction of four-dimensional n = 2 su(n) gauge
theory with 2n hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. this is a
conformal eld theory. since the d4-branes are innite they can be thought
of as aligned d4-branes ending on either side of the ns5-branes. such a
set-up does not result in bending of the branes since the force exerted by a
d4-brane on one side of a ns5-brane is exactly compensated by the aligned
d4-brane on the other side of the ns5-brane. this fact has the important
consequence that when we lift this conguration to m-theory it receives no
non-perturbative corrections.

clearly this 10-dimensional background can be obtained from an 11-
dimensional background of m5-branes intersecting so as to preserve one
quarter supersymmetry, as discussed in section 2. we can lift the hanany-
witten conguration to two m5-branes with world-volume 012345 localized
at t = t1, r = 0 and t = t2, r = 0 respectively; and n m5-branes with
world-volume 012367 localized at v = 0, r = 0. the riemann surface  men-
tioned in the previous section is easy to construct using the methods of [17].
according to [17] the riemann surface can be represented as :

a(v)t2 + b(v)t + c(v) = 0

(with t = exp s/r7).

(44)

since we are compactifying m-theory on a circle of radius r7 to give type
iia, we use the single-valued coordinate t instead of s.

a = b = c = qn

now since for arbitrary t we are on the world-volume of the m5-brane
only if v = vi, i.e. at the locations of the d4-branes, we conclude that
i=1(v  vi). the constants ,  are xed by requiring
that t2 + t/ + 1/ = 0 has solutions at t = t1,2, the positions of the two
ns5-branes. we will be interested in the case of maximal gauge symmetry
enhancement when the d4-branes coincide, i.e. vi = 0. the riemann surface
 then splits up into three holomorphic cycles: i) v = 0, t arbitrary, ii) t = t1,
v arbitrary, iii) t = t2 with v arbitrary. thus the lift of the type iia hanany-
witten conguration is 2 m5-branes localized at t = t1,2 and n m5-branes
localized at v = 0 with the overall transverse coordinates x = 0. in the
following section we will show in detail how to use these results to construct

8

the 10-dimensional metric.

since we wish to make contact with maldacenas conjecture, we will really
be interested in the near-horizon limit of this solution. here we use a naive
interpretation of near-horizon as simply meaning that the harmonic functions
approach zero at innity instead of 1. this limit will in fact allow us to nd
a solution where the n d4-branes are fully localised. we will then show that
in the appropriate limit the metric contains an ads5 factor as is required for
the equivalence via maldacenas duality to a 4-dimensional conformal eld
theory.

3.1

11 to 10 dimensions

we have 2 m5-branes with worldvolume 012345 and n with worldvolume
012367. we will compactify the 7 direction on a circle to produce the required
hanany-witten brane construction in type iia. for simplicity we will assume
translation invariance in the 6 direction as well as the 7 direction, i.e. we will
have the n m5-branes fully localised but the 2 m5-branes will be smeared
in the 6 and 7 directions (or s and s directions.) the standard relation
between 11-dimensional supergravity and 10-dimensional type iia string-
frame metrics is [40, 41]:

ds2

11 = e 2

3 ds2

10 + e

3 (dx7 + aidxi)2

using the form of the 11-dimensional solution, equation (36), we nd:

a5 =

3 gss
(gvs  gsv)
(gvs + gsv)

2gss

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

with all other components of ai vanishing. so the general form of the 10-
dimensional metric is:

the 10-dimensional 3- and 4-form eld strengths are given in terms of the
11-dimensional 4-form by [41]:

f 10d
m n p q = f 11d
m n p q
hm n p = 2f 11d
m n p 7

3.2 ansatz for solution

we will now assume that the metric gmn is of the form:

q1
r

gss =
gvv = gvv(|v|, r)
gsv = gvs = 0

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)
(54)

where r = qxx is the radial coordinate in the overall transverse 3-

dimensional space and q1 is a constant. note that this ansatz guarantees
that gmn is kahler.

so now we must nd a solution to the source equations (27). the sources
will be a delta function in the 3 overall transverse dimensions corresponding
to the 2 smeared 5-branes and a delta function in the 5-dimensional space
transverse to the n 5-branes. so we see that equations (27) are satised, up
to normalisation of q1, by our ansatz except for the case of the vv components.
for the vv components we have (using a coordinate transformation used in
[21]):

8vvg + gvv =

=

=

1
2q1
|v|(|v||v|gvv) +
|v|
r
16q2

1
2
|v|
16q2

r5 r(r5rgvv)
2

|v|(|v||v|gvv) +

1
r2 r(r2rgvv)
16q2
1
5 (3gvv)

(55)

where  = 8q1r and r2 = 2 + |v|2 and in the last step we have assumed

that gvv is only a function of r.

so we can now see that we have a solution for gvv:

gvv =

q2
r4 =

q2

(8q1r + |v|2)2
10

(56)

where q2 is a constant. we will now x the constants q1 and q2.

in m-theory the normalization of the source equations is as follows:

2gss + 8ssg = 43l3
2gvv + 8vvg = n43l3
2gvs + 8vsg = 0

p(3)(r)(cid:16)(2)(s  l/2) + (2)(s + l/2)(cid:17)
p(3)(r)(2)(v)

(57)

we can reduce the solution down to 10-dimensions by compactifying x7 with
radius r7. when r7 is small enough we can smear branes in the x7 direction
p = r7 =
and replace the delta function by 1/2r7
gs()3/2 we get:

2. using the relation l3

2gss + 266g = 22(3)(r)(cid:16)(x6  l/2) + (x6 + l/2)(cid:17)
2gvv + 8vvg = n43gs()3/2(3)(r)(2)(v)
2gvs + 4v6g = 0.

(58)

finally, we smear the 2 ns5-branes in the x6 direction. we compactify the
x6 direction with radius /c1. smearing in the 6 direction, we can replace
the delta functions by c1/2. more generally, if we have n ns5-branes
the source equation becomes:

2gss + 266g = nc1()1/2(3)(r).

we can now x the normalization

q1 = n()1/2c1/4

(59)

(60)

and after inserting appropriate volume factors to convert the 6-dimensional
delta function at r = 0 in equation (55) to delta functions in r and v:

q2 = 8gs()3/2nq1
= 2gs()2nnc1

(61)
(62)

2this procedure gives the same result as the poisson summation of the harmonic func-

tion given in [42].

3.3 decoupling limit

the near-horizon limit is one in which eld theory quantities are held xed
while decoupling the bulk degrees of freedom. it is natural to express the
metric in terms of variables appropriate to this limit.

in this system of d4-branes and ns5-branes we would like to preserve the
masses of eld theory excitations and the eld theory coupling constant. the
moduli space of the eld theory is parameterized by a complex adjoint higgs
eld. on the supergravity side the higgs expectation values are given by
the positions of the d4-branes in v. the mass of a string stretched between
two d4-branes is |w| = |v|/ where |v| is the coordinate distance between
the branes. these states are electrically charged. there are also magnet-
ically charged states which are described by d2-branes stretched between
d4-branes. they have mass:

m = |v|l

gs()3/2 = |v|

g2

y m  = |w|

g2
y m

,

(63)

where l is the coordinate distance between the two ns5-branes. thus in the
  0 limit if we keep w = v/ and the yang-mills coupling constant gy m
xed, the eld theory states have nite mass.
the eld theory living on the d4-branes has only v as a modulus and
the eld theory excitations only determine the scaling of v. the remaining
coordinates r, x6 in the decoupling limit have their scalings determined by
keeping excitations on the ns5-brane and the yang-mills coupling constant
xed. the ns5-branes have d2-branes ending on them. the ends of the d2-
brane appear as strings in the ns5-branes world volume theory with tension
r/gs3/2. in the decoupling limit we take   0 while keeping r/gs3/2
xed.
lastly the scaling of x6 can be determined as follows in the decoupling
limit. the yang-mills coupling constant is given by g2
y m = l/gs()1/2,
where l is the coordinate distance between the two ns5-branes. thus to
keep the coupling constant xed in the eld theory we have to take the limit
  0 while keeping x6/gs1/2 xed.
with n ns5-branes the gauge group is su(n)n. the gauge coupling of
each su(n) group is given by the separation, l, of two consecutive ns5-
branes in the x6 direction. since we have smeared the ns5-branes around
the circle, they should be considered to be equally spaced. this circle has

12

radius /c1 so l = 2/(nc1). so we have:
2

g2
y m

=

l
gs

=

ngsc1

(64)

so we should keep ngsc1 xed or if we take the large n limit with xed t
hooft coupling, we should keep nngsc1 xed.

so we will dene variables u, w and t with dimensions of mass and a

dimensionless angular variable :

(79)

since h = db we can calculate the non-trivial part of the b-eld. we nd:

where we have chosen to keep the constant of integration c0.

4 t-duality

using the t-duality rules [43, 44, 41] we can t-dualise the metric (77) to
a type iib metric for d3-branes at an an1 singularity. the near horizon
limit is described by type iib supergravity on the space ads5  (s5/zn).
the ads/cft correspondence in this case has been discussed in [4, 5]. we
perform the t-duality in the 6 direction which we have already considered
to be compact, parameterised by the angular coordinate . as described
in [24], t-duality transverse to n ns5-branes transforms them to n kaluza-
klein 5-branes which are equivalent to an n-centred taub-nut space in the
transverse directions. when the centres coincide as in this case there is an
an1 singularity and at low energies we can simply describe the space as a

14

c2/zn orbifold. in our case where the d4-branes ll the 6 direction we will
end up with d3-branes at the orbifold xed point. however this t-duality
can still be performed for general hanany-witten setups with d4-branes
ending on ns5-branes. in this case the d4-branes will t-dualise to fractional
d3-branes at the orbifold xed point [27, 28]. so the problem of nding the
supergravity solution for a general (non-conformal) hanany-witten setup is
equivalent to nding the metric for fractional d3-branes at an orbifold xed
point.

we now briey describe how to write down the metric for d3-branes
in the presence of an ak1 ale singularity. an ale space with an ak1
singularity can be dened as a c2/zk orbifold, where the action of the zk is
given as follows:

2
z1  exp (i
k
z2  exp (i

2
k

)z1

)z2.

(81)

the coordinates z1, z2 are covering space coordinates of the ale space, and
in these coordinates the metric of the ale space is at. thus in the covering
space coordinates one can easily write down the solution for d3-branes [7, 9].
in fact, it is identical to the usual metric [45] except now one has to introduce
images of the d3-branes due to the identication (81). to have n d3-branes
in the presence of the ale singularity one has to introduce nk d3-branes
in the covering space, where n(k  1) of them are images. the metric for all
n d3-branes localized at the origin is given by:

where

ds2 = f 1/2dx2

k + f 1/2(cid:16)|dv|2 + |dz1|2 + |dz2|2(cid:17)

f = 1 +

4gskn2

.

(82)

(83)

we can now change variables from the covering space to single-valued vari-
ables as in [21]:

2 = |z1|2 + |z2|2
ei 
z1 =  cos

k

eii

z2 =  sin

15

(84)

(85)

with 0    , 0   < 2 and 0   < 2. we also introduce

 = r sin 
v = r cos ei

(86)

with 0    /2, 0   < 2. we can now take the near-horizon limit
  0 with u = r/ held xed where we can ignore the constant term in f
and write (82) as:

1
 ds2

10 =   u2
q
sin2 d2 +

(cos   1)d(cid:17)2! .

where q is dened in terms of the iib string coupling by:

q = 4gskn.

(87)

(88)

we will now show that the t-dual of our iia metric is precisely this metric,
with k identied with n, the number of ns5-branes. this provides a non-
trivial check of our solution and normalisations.

for the solution (77) the t-duality rules are fairly simple since the metric
is diagonal and only a few gauge elds are non-trivial. from [43, 44, 41] we
have the following transformation rules for t-duality along the  direction:

g = g1

g = bg1

g = g + (b)2g1

gm n = gm n

exp() = exp()g

f (5)

(89)
(90)

(92)

(93)

(94)

where all quantities on the left are the type iib parameters, determined by
the type iia parameters on the right. the indices m, n are any spacetime
indices except  and . f (5) is the 5-form eld strength in type iib and

16

self-duality must be imposed. the transformations are written for  = 1. it
is now a simple matter to apply the t-duality rules and we nd the type iib
metric:

1

10 =   u2

(cid:16)d  c

the iib string coupling is given in terms of the iia string coupling by
equation (93). our iia metric is only valid in the near-horizon limit so we
cant substitute g into equation (93) to relate the string couplings which
are dened asymptotically. however we have normalised our solution so that
the metric should be asymptotically at. so asymptotically we must have
g = 1/c2
couplings are related by:

1 since the radius of the  direction is /c1. so the string

and so in terms of iib quantities we have:

s = c1giia
giib

s

q = 4gsnn

(96)

(97)

so we see that with c0 = 1 we reproduce the metric for n d3-branes
at a c2/zn orbifold xed point. the relation between the variables in equa-
tion (87) and our notation is easily seen to be: sin  = cos ,  = ,  = ,
c =  and  = .

finally we give the non-trivial type iib 5-form components:

(f ) = f =

(98)

5 conclusions

we have shown the general form of the 11-dimensional supergravity solution
describing a 5-brane conguration with worldvolume ir4   with  being a
holomorphic 2-cycle in c2. this corresponds to a single 5-brane or multiple
5-branes depending on the form of , i.e. whether or not  is simply con-
nected. we have also shown the reduction of this solution to 10 dimensions

17

by compactifying one real coordinate of c2 on a circle. this conguration
will generically correspond to a system of d4- and ns5-branes in type iia
string theory.

we were unable to fully solve the source equations (27) but in the special
case we were interested in we could nd a near-horizon solution for n fully
localised 5-branes intersecting n 5-branes which were smeared along the lo-
calised 5-branes. apart from the smearing, this reduces to a hanany-witten
conguration in type iia describing the n = 2 conformal eld theory with
gauge group su(n)n. taking the near-horizon limit in supergravity should
give the maldacena dual of the cft and indeed we see that this is plausible
since we showed that the space factorises into the form ads5  m where m
is a compact manifold with the isometries of the eld theory r-symmetry
group in addition to a u(1) due to smearing.

there are a number of directions one can pursue. one is to construct the
m-theory solution for non-conformal eld theories in which the corresponding
type iia picture has non-aligned d4-branes. of interest also in the conformal
theories considered here is to fully localise the ns5-branes. this would allow
arbitrary gauge couplings for each su(n) factor and would permit solutions
with nite gauge couplings without compactifying x6. from the supergravity
point of view it would also be interesting to fully localise the m5-branes in 11
dimensions. another question [39] which one can address is that of conformal
eld theories with more exotic matter content than fundamental and adjoint
matter. for example by introducing a third ns5-brane and an orientifold
6-plane [46] one can have symmetric or anti-symmetric second rank tensor
representations.
