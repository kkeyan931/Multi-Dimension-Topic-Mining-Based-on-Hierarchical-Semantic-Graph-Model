abstract

we extend the concept of quintessence to at nonminimally coupled scalar

1

tensor theories of gravity. by means of noethers symmetries for the cosmo-

logical pointlike lagrangian l, it is possible to exhibit exact solutions for a
class of models depending on a free parameter s. this parameter comes out

in the relationship existing between the coupling f () and the potential v ()

because of such a symmetry for l. when inverse powerlaw potentials are
taken into account, a whole family of exact solutions parametrized by such

an s is proposed as a class of tracker elds, and some considerations are made

about them.

i. introduction

recently, astronomical observations have indicated a strong evidence of an accelerated

universe [13]. together with measurements of the cosmic microwave background and the

mass power spectrum (see [4], for example), they suggest that a large amount of the energy

density of the universe should have a negative pressure. a way of describing the missing com-

ponent of the energy needed to reach, for instance, the critical energy density is quintessence

[57,4]. essentially, this is a spatially inhomogeneous and slowly evolving fraction of the to-

tal energy. we may consider it as given by a scalar eld  slowly rolling down its potential

v () and such that 1 < w < 0, being w  p/, where p and  are, respectively,
the pressure and the energy density of the scalar eld. actually, recent considerations [8] x
the interval 1 < w <
 0.6 as the more suitable one for such a scalar eld to eectively
represent quintessence. (a cosmological constant , which mimics vacuum energy density,

also produces a negative pressure, but this is such that p/ = 1.)

within the scenario created by quintessence, there is a twofold problem. one of its

two aspects is the socalled netuning problem, based on the question why  appears to

be so small with respect to typical particle physics scales. the other aspect, called cosmic

coincidence [9], requires that the initial conditions have to be set precisely in order to explain

why  and the matter energy density m should appear of the same order today. this poses

problems on the theoretical choice for the energy fraction which seems to be missing.

more recently, a special form of quintessence has been introduced to avoid the coinci-

dence problem. it is called tracker eld [7,10] and works like an attractor solution to the

equations of motion, even if it is not really a xed point, since it is time dependent and

/m changes as  evolves, leaving later cosmology independent of the early conditions. of

the kinds of potentials proposed for quintessence, two have been more studied for tracker
solutions, namely, v () = m 4+ and v () = m 4[exp(mp /)  1], where m and  > 0
are free parameters, and mp is the planck mass. the family of tracker solutions is then

parametrized by m, whose value can be xed by the measured value of m today. such

3

specic forms of potentials have been chosen because of their importance in particle physics

models [1114]. anyway, to our knowledge, ratra and peebles [15,16] were the rst ones to

study the inuence of an inverse powerlaw potential in cosmology with a scalar eld.

a general study of specic features of tracker solutions has been made [7,10], also leading

to the introduction of the important function , in order to fulll the socalled tracker

equation. essentially, it is shown that tracking behavior with wq < wb occurs for any
potential in which   v v /(v )2 > 1 and is nearly constant for any possible initial value
of the scalar eld q. (here, prime denotes derivative with respect to q, and b indicates

background.) as a consequence, once a certain potential has been assigned, the existence of

tracking solutions can be tested without solving the equations of motion.

usually, the scalar eld representing quintessence has been considered as minimally cou-

pled to gravity and only more recently nonminimal coupling has been introduced in such a

context [1719]. in this connection, we consider interesting to refer again to scalartensor

theories of gravity, in which the scalar eld  is nonminimally coupled to gravity and also

inverse powerlaw potentials for  have been studied, leading to exact solutions for (t) and

for the scale factor a(t) of the universe (see [20] and references therein for a review on this

topic). our main purpose is to outline how a family of exact tracker solutions can be derived

from a at nonminimally coupled theory with inverse powerlaw potential, expliciting also

how the tracker equation is fullled in such a way.

in what follows, section 2 is devoted to a short review of some basic notions of at

nonminimally coupled theories, and section 3 selects a special class of solutions. in section 4

we identify such a class as a family of tracker solutions, and in section 5 we draw conclusions.

ii. nonminimally coupled theories

as it is well known, one of the main reasons why nonminimally coupled scalartensor

theories of gravity have received a special degree of attention is that they seem to play an

important role in inationary cosmology (see [20], for instance). in the following, however,

4

we will limit ourselves to concentrate on what can be useful here, trying to draw a sort

of narrow and straightforward path to our specic goal, namely deriving tracker solutions.

first of all, we deal with at (i.e., with the curvature scalar k = 0) models described by the

action

a = z d4xghf ()r + 1

2g;;  v () + lmi ,

(1)

where g is the determinant of the metric g, r the curvature scalar, semicolon indicates

ccovariant derivative, and the functions f () and v () are not specied; lm is the la-
grangian of an ordinary perfect uid noncoupled to the scalar eld . f () expresses the

nonminimal coupling of  with gravity and is such that, when f  f0  1/2 (using units
such that 8g = c = h = 1), action in eq. (1) reduces to the usual one in the at minimal

coupling case.

the eld equations can be derived by varying eq. (1) with respect to g and they can

be written as

g = t  

1

2f ()

t (tot)


,

(2)

where g  r  1
stressenergy tensor

2gr is the einstein tensor, and t is a quantity related to the total

here, the tensor

  t ()
t (tot)

 + t (m)


.

t ()
  ;;

g;; + gv ()

+2g 2f ()  2f ();

(3)

(4)

represents the scalar eld source, while t (m)


is the standard perfect uid matter source (and

2 is the usual dalembert operator). varying with respect to , we get the kleingordon

equation ruling the dynamics of the scalar eld 

2  rf () + v () = 0 ,

5

(5)

denoting the prime the derivative with respect to .

it is possible to show that eq. (5)

is nothing else but the contracted bianchi identity [21,20], which means that the eective

stressenergy tensor t introduced in eq. (2) is a zerodivergence tensor, coherently with

einsteins theory of gravity [22].

fixing a homogeneous and isotropic (frw) metric reduces the relevant variables to a

and , i.e. the scale factor and the scalar eld, each one a function of t only. as a matter

of fact, eld equations (2) can be reduced to two ordinary dierential equations (k = 0)

where dot indicates the time derivative, h  a/a, pm = wmm is the equation of state for

dened its pressure and energy density, respectively, as

this implies, thus, that

(8)

(9)

(10)

now, it is very interesting, and for us very important, to notice that eq. (5) (rewritten

in the frw at case) and eq. (7) can be seen as the eulerlagrange equations of the point

lagrangian

l = 6a a2f () + 6 a a2f () + a3(p + pm) ,

(11)

eq. (6) being equivalent to el = 0, where el is the energy. the conguration space is

then given by q  {a, } (the minisuperspace) and the tangent space by t q  {a, a, , },

6

being the coordinates associated with the pointlike lagrangian l just the scale factor a
it is important to stress that from eq. (11)
and the scalar eld , with velocities a,

.

we get that el = const.; making the homogeneous and isotropic limit of einstein eld

equations

(2) implies to choose such a constant equal to zero. according to noethers

theorem, the existence of a symmetry for the dynamics derived from l involves a constant
of motion. as a consequence, noether symmetries in cosmology give the possibility to infer

some transformations of variables which often lead to deduce exact cosmological solutions

[23,24,20]. such solutions, though obtained by means of a procedure suggested by the

existence of this kind of symmetries, are actually independent of it and could also be got by

chance, suitably choosing the right transformation of variables. that is, a noether symmetry

simply suggests that such a transformation should exist and gives an easy way to nd it: once

we have the right way to write down equations, we can easily solve them and get a solution.

we have to stress, also, that, in order to verify the existence of a noether symmetry, we

nd a way of assigning the functions f () and v () for which a noether symmetry exists,

leading to remarkable results in many cases (see again [20] and references therein for several

examples). in the following, we will introduce a class of exact solutions which deserves a

special attention in the context we are working in.

iii. a special class of solutions

first of all, let us notice that we start from the pointlike lagrangian (11). it represents

a whole class of theories, since a particular model is assigned by specifying f () and v ().

examining the existence of noether symmetries when the matter content is dust (pm = 0),

as a rst result [25,20] one deduces the relevant relation

v () = v0f ()p(s) ,

where v0 > 0 is an arbitrary constant assumed always positive, and

p(s) =

3(s + 1)
2s + 3

.

7

(12)

(13)

therefore, the potential, through its exponent p(s), depends on the free parameter s. (the

case s = 3/2 is degenerate and has been studied separately [26,20]. when s = 1, p(s) is
zero and v () becomes a constant; this situation has also been treated apart [20].)

the existence of such symmetries for lagrangian (11) implies that we can nd a dier-

ential equation for f () which has a general solution expressed by an elliptical integral of

second kind, but we will limit our attention here to the particular solution

f () = k02 ,

(14)

where k0 < 0 is an arbitrary constant. (negative values of f () are necessary to disregard

repulsive gravity.) then, eq. (14) inserted into eq. (12) gives

v () = hv0k0

p(s)i 2p(s) .

(15)

it is possible to see that there is a whole family of exact solutions for the time evolutions

of a and , and that they can be expressed as [20]

where

a( ) = (s) r ,

( ) = (s) 6/(s) ,

(s)  

6s

2s + 3

, (s)  " (s)

3 #3/(s)

,

(s)  (s)2/[3p(s)] , r 

2s2 + 9s + 6

s(s + 3)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

are parameters depending on s. time  is, actually, a rescaled time.

apart from the cases showing pathologies in the solutions (s = 0 and s = 3), which
have to be discussed separately [25], it is important to notice that the right sign of the

coupling, i.e. f () < 0, implies

 2 < s < 1 .

8

(20)

when s varies in such an interval, we have an innite number of exact solutions of the forms

given in eqs. (16) and (17). asymptotically, we have

a( )   r , ( )   (2s+3)/s .

(21)

that is, depending on the values of s, the scale factor a( ) can have asymptotic friedmann,
powerlaw and pole-like behaviors. for instance, when |s|  0, it is a( )   2. but, in the
range of values in eq. (20), it can only be friedmannian or powerlaw.

as to the scalar eld , it diverges for s < 3/2 and converges for s > 3/2. in what

follows, the range of values anyway chosen for s will always be in the latter interval.

iv. a family of exact tracker solutions

let us pose

  2p(s) > 0 .

from the denition of p(s) in eq. (13), this implies

and eq. (15) gives

3
2



< s < 1 ,

v () = (cid:16)v0k0

/2(cid:17)  ,

(22)

(23)

(24)

with  always both positive and even. substituting  into eqs. (16), (17), (18), and (19)

yields

a( ) = (cid:18)2 + 

3 (cid:19)4/[(2+)]

2(22+9+6)
3(2+6+8) ,



( ) = (cid:18)2 + 

3 (cid:19)3/(2+)

 2/(2+) .

(25)

(26)

on the other hand, from eq. (10) we see that, being

9

2
2v

x 

> 0

(where now dot indicates derivative with respect to rescaled time  ), we can write

w =

x  1
x + 1

.

(27)

(28)

thus, it is clear that it is always w > 1. for a constant , i.e. a constant potential
(which mimics a cosmological constant term), we should get w = 1. we have in general

2
2v

=

/2

k0
2v0

x 

2 > 0 ,

k0

/2 > 0 ,

implying the constraint

which is always true.

(29)

(30)

one of the main requests that the scalar eld has to satisfy, in order for it to be seen

as a good tracker eld, is that 2 < v (), i.e. that x < 1. requiring that 0 < x < 1 then

poses the condition

0 < k0

/2 <

27v0

2(2 + )

.

(31)

of course, 0 < x < 1 also implies that w < 0, so that it is 1 < w < 0, namely what is
needed for the scalar eld to be interpreted as quintessence. recently, it has been claimed

that constraints from largescale structure together with snia data imply w < 0.6 with

95% of condence level [8], which forces the eld of variation for x to be

this, in turn, yields

0 < x < 0.25 .

0 < k0

/2 <

27v0

8(2 + )

.

(32)

(33)

constraints given by eq. (31) are also consistent with a direct calculation of w from eq.

(10). as a matter of fact, inserting into it the expression of eq. (26) for ( ), we get

10

w =

2k0
2k0

/2(2 + )  27v0
/2(2 + ) + 27v0

.

(34)

that is, w < 0 implies eq. (31).

a further restriction can be found on the values of s, already such that eq. (23) holds,

if one looks at equipartition at the end of ination for inverse powerlaw potentials. this,

being  even, constrains to  > 5 [10], so that

3

< s < 

21
16

.

(35)

in [10], in a minimal coupling regime, there were also introduced two important equations,

the equation of motion and the tracker equation. as a matter of fact, the rst one can be

easily generalized to the nonminimal coupling situation, giving

v

where   8g/3 (we are changing now our units following the current litereture),  
/h 2, and f  = 2k0. (the  signs, respectively, depend on whether v  > 0 or v  < 0.)
f  = 0 gives the minimal coupling case, and all cosmological solutions converge to the

tracking solution, which is such that w is nearly constant and less than wb (where b
indicates background), implying that 1 + w = o(1) and therefore 2  h 2 = , so
that

q 

(37)

this is referred to as the tracker equation [10].

we can also introduce the function   v v /(v )2, used in [10] for a test on the tracker

behavior. let us notice, then, that we have at all times

v v
(v )2 =

2p(s)  1
2p(s)

 

= 1 +

= const. ,

(38)

which is the major condition for a tracker behavior. it is  > 1 for s in the interval in eq.

(23), being

11

 =

4s + 3
6(s + 1)

= 1 

2s + 3
6(s + 1)

.

(39)

of course, the range of values in eq. (35) for  > 5 is contained in the one in eq. (23), still

implying therefore  > 1.

the tracker equation is then

(40)

giving back what can be written for the minimal coupling case (when f  = 0). here,
x  d ln x/d ln a and x  d2 ln x/d ln a2.

when an inverse powerlaw potential is considered, as shown in [27] for the minimal
coupling case and in [17] for a nonminimal coupling case (with f ()  2/2, being  a
constant, but with a slightly dierent lagrangian for ), if the perfect uid with b 
a3(1+wb ) dominates, so that a  t2/[3/(1+wb )], then the following relation holds

w 

wb  2
 + 2

.

(41)

on the other hand, if  is nearly constant, eq. (41) in the minimal coupling regime implies

[10] that a solution exists in which w is also nearly constant and x,

x, x become nearly

zero. this also leads to eq. (41).

from eq. (38), relation in eq. (41) can be written as

wb  w =

2(  1)(wb  1)

1 + 2(  1)

,

(42)

evidentiating the fact that  > 1 is equivalent to wb > w in a matter dominated situation.

in [17] it is found a solution for  of the same type as in eq. (26). thus, the situation

described therein is practically similar to ours, and we can import some of its considerations.
assuming that the universe is matter dominated, a  t2/[3/(1+wb )] implies that h = [2/3(1 +
wb)]t1, and the kleingordon equation (5) can be written as

(43)

as demonstrated in [17], this involves, for example, that we can take eq. (41) as valid also

in our context, even if we did not write eq. (40) in such a way to clearly evidentiate that

behavior when x, x, x are negligible and w is constant.

if we, only in a speculative way, compare eq. (34), exact and always valid at any time,

and eq. (41), approximated and valid only when b  , we nd

k0

/2 =

(1 + wb)
4(2 + )

, v0 =

4 + (1  wb)

54

.

this forces the constant k0

/2 to be

k0

/2 =

1
2 

27v0

2(2 + )

and, according to eq. (31), leads to

or, from eq. (33), to

2 + 

54

< v0 <

2 + 

27

4(2 + )

135

< v0 <

also, substituting eq. (44) directly into eq. (31) and eq. (33), respectively, gives

or, equivalently,

wb <

.

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

let us notice, then, that the second relation in eq. (48) always implies wb < 0 (which is

not good for ordinary matter), while the rst relation in eq. (48) gives the right constraint

wb < 1. also, the second relation in eq. (49) yields  < 4/3 for dust (wb = 0) and  < 1/2

13

for sti matter (wb = 1), while the rst relation in eq. (49) lets us accept any value of 

for dust, and gives  < 6 for radiation (wb = 1/3) or  < 2 for sti matter. finally, we can

say that these considerations seem to imply that eq. (32) limits too much the variability of

x.

let us also notice that eq. (41) could be read as

wb 

2  (2 + )|w|



.

(50)

now, for ordinary matter (i.e., when 0  wb  1), it comes out (always disregarding the
approximated equality)

2  
2 +   |w| 

2

2 + 

,

(51)

implying (for  = 2) 0  w  1/2, or (for  = 4) 0 < |w|  1/3, for instance. this
<
means, then, that values w
 0.6 are however possible, even if considerations made above

let us understand that there may also be values of w such that 0.6 < w < 0.

of course, all these kinds of considerations have to be taken just as indicative, since eq.

(41) is not always valid and is usually read in one way: once we assign a specic value of wb,

then it gives an approximated value of w. for example, wb = 0 gives w  2/(2 + ) < 0
for any  > 0, and from wb = 1/3 it is found w  (  6)/[3(2 + )] (giving the critical
value  = 6, such that  > 6 implies positive w and  > 6 implies negative w).

on the other hand, anyway, taking the tracker condition in eq. (37) into account, we

can immediately control its validity, being

v 
v

1+wb

h
  

1+w

(52)

(53)

as a global consequence, we can assert that (26) is a good family of exact tracker solutions,

parametrized by the constants v0 and k0, being

m 4+  v0k/2

0

.

14

(54)

if we consider relations in eq. (44), apart from the contribution of the ordinary matter

content, the parameter m depends only on s

m =

(55)

the observational constraint   0.7 today, when   o(mp ), implies that v (  mp ) 
m0, being m0  1047gev4 the current matter density. this gives [7]

v () = m 4+  m 4+m 

p  m0 ,

(56)

so that m  (m0m 
 >
 2, that is s <

p )1/(4+) > 1gev, in good comparison to particle physics scale, when
 1.2. (this shows again that, since such a value does not respect eq.

(35), constraining to  > 5 should be reconsidered.)

v. conclusions

in the picture oered by observations in recent times, a good cosmological scenario

needs an energy component with negative pressure. of course, the simplest and most ex-

treme candidate is a cosmological constant, but other softer proposals exist. among these,

quintessence has been advanced resuming, generalizing, and suitably readapting older ideas

on cosmology with a scalar eld. initially thought of as a eld acting like an attractor on

other solutions, a more rened version of it has been proposed more recently, namely the

tracker eld. this kind of eld tends to isotropize the universe at late times, nicely solving

the coincidence problem.

in that, it nds an ideal convergence with what is claimed by

walds theorem on isotropization in homogeneous cosmologies with a positive cosmological

constant.

in this paper, we have shown that the requested features of such a eld when v () has

an inverse powerlaw behavior can be obtained looking at a kind of exact solutions already

present in the past literature on nonminimally coupled scalartensor theories of gravity (see

[20], for example). even if it was deduced in a very peculiar way there, nevertheless it has

15

been reintroduced as, say, an ad hoc tracker solution only more recently. for these reasons,

it has seemed interesting to connect the solution for  to the solution for a, placing all the

discussion in the context of a well developed theory. to be precise, then, a family of exact

tracker solutions has been found here, depending on the values of a parameter s which is

crucial for the relationship existing between the coupling f () and the potential v () in

our context.

such a relationship is a condition for a noether symmetry to exist in the cosmological

scenario involved by the model proposed through action in eq. (1). this condition appears

to be very important to us, because it seems to imply tracker elds in a very natural way,

based on the apparent naturality of noether symmetries in cosmology [20].

also, in the context of nonminimally coupled scalartensor theories of gravity, there is no

dramatic dierence between quintessence and cosmological constant proposals, introduced

to solve the puzzle oered by recent observations. it can be shown that there is, in fact, an

evident possibility to generalize walds theorem [28] in order to get an asymptotic cosmo-

logical constant in many nonminimal theories, without introducing it a priori (see [29] and

references therein). as a matter of fact, for many choices of f (), a time dependent term

can be dened, asymptotically approaching a constant (that is, a cosmological constant).

(in [29] several examples are considered.) in this connection, it is noteworthy that some

interesting comments have also been made [30] on the fact that, with respect to the coin-

cidence problem, an inverse powerlaw potential is not really dierent from a cosmological

constant.
