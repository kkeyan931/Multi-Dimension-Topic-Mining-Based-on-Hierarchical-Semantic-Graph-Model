abstract

the irreducible antield formalism for p-form gauge theories with
gauge invariant interaction terms is exposed. the ghosts of ghosts
do not appear. the acyclicity of the koszul-tate operator is ensured
without introducing antields at resolution degrees higher that two.

pacs number: 11.10.ef

it is widely known that gauge theories involving p-forms are important
due to their link with string theory and supergravity models [1][6], and also
due to the importance of their characteristic cohomology [7]. a typical fea-
ture of such theories is given by their redundant behavior, i.e., the reducibil-
ity of the gauge generators. the reducibility further implies the presence of
ghost elds with ghost number greater that one (ghosts of ghosts, etc.), and,
in the meantime, a pyramid of non-minimal variables in the framework of
the lagrangian brst formalism [8][12]. the ghost and non-minimal struc-
tures of interacting p-forms were exposed in [13] in the light of the reducible
hamiltonian brst method.

this paper investigates whether gauge theories involving abelian p-forms
with interactions that possess the same gauge invariances like the free theory
can be consistently quantized along the irreducible antield-brst formalism.

our main result is that this is always possible (for the priorly invoked class
of theories). as far as we know, this problem has not been approached.
as a consequence of our irreducible treatment, the ghosts of ghosts are not
necessary, and the auxiliary elds have a linear structure (in contrast with the
pyramidal reducible structure). our method basically relies on replacing the
redundant gauge theory with an irreducible one possessing the same physical
observables, and on further quantizing the resulting irreducible gauge system.
the main points approached in our paper are as follows. first, we explain
in detail our irreducible mechanism in the case of free abelian p-form gauge
elds. second, we extend the results to gauge theories involving various
sorts of abelian forms with gauge invariant interaction terms, and reduce the
problem to the free case analysis. this is possible by virtue of the fact that
the reducibility functions associated with the interacting system are diagonal.
we start with the lagrangian action of free abelian p-form gauge elds

let us show that the above mentioned gauge transformations are irre-

ducible. in this respect, we take 1...p2k1
in (2) and (5)
(for k = 0, . . . , ap, with ap = p/2  1, or (p  1) /2 for p even, respectively,

in this way, we associated an irreducible theory, described by action (6) and
the gauge transformations (2), (5), with the starting redundant model.

step by step, we infer along the same line that f does not depend on the new

= 0. due to the fact that, on the one hand the last

(p)

equations stand for the equation fullled by the observables of the reducible
theory, and on the other hand f depends only on the original elds, it results
that any observable of the irreducible system is also an observable of the re-

(cid:17) represents

ducible one. at the same time, it is obvious that if f (cid:16)a1...p

an observable of the reducible theory, then it remains so for the irreducible
system, because it automatically satises (7). in consequence, the irreducible
and reducible versions are physically equivalent, describing the same physi-
cal theory. from the point of view of the brst formalism, the zeroth order
cohomological groups of the longitudinal exterior derivative along the gauge
orbits associated with the reducible, respectively, irreducible model coincide.
thus, if we show that the koszul-tate operator in the irreducible case is
acyclic, the homological perturbation theory [14][17] ensures: (i) the nilpo-
tency of the irreducible brst symmetry, s, and (ii) h 0 (s) = {observables},
with h 0 (s) the zeroth order cohomological group of s. this makes legit-
imate from the physical point of view, i.e., from the point of view of the
requirements s2 = 0, h 0 (s) = {observables}, the replacement of the brst
quantization of the reducible theory with the quantization of the irreducible
one.

at this point we briey investigate the higher order cohomological groups
of the longitudinal exterior derivative along the gauge orbits. this analysis
will be relevant during the gauge-xing process. more precisely, we show
that all the higher order groups in the irreducible situation are trivial. this
can be seen by introducing the minimal ghost spectrum in the irreducible
case, namely 1...p2k1
(with k = 0, . . . , ap), and dening the action of the
longitudinal exterior derivative along the gauge orbits as usually, through

the ghosts  are fermionic, with pure ghost number one. from (89) it will
follow that all the ghosts are d-exact. here we indicate the line corresponding
to p even, the opposite situation being treated similarly. we start with the

with 1...p2k1
. on the one
hand, from (10) it follows that any d-closed quantity of pure ghost number
greater than zero is a polynomial in the ghosts with coecients that are
gauge invariant functions. on the other hand, from (11) it results that any
such polynomial is d-exact. as a consequence, all h q (d) with q > 0 vanish
in our irreducible approach.

now, we prove that the koszul-tate operator corresponding to the ir-
reducible model, , is truly acyclic. accordingly the standard brst re-
ceipt, the minimal antield spectrum reads as a
(k = 0, . . . , bp)
and  
(with k = 0, . . . , ap). the as are fermionic and have
antighost number one, while the  s are bosonic, with antighost number
two. we dene the action of  on the generators from the brst complex as

the -closed polynomials are killed step by step in the homology of  by
appropriately introducing some new generators (the antields associated with
the ghosts of ghosts). this is not necessary in our treatment, as we show that
the -closed quantities with positive resolution degrees from the irreducible
case are -exact. in this respect, we prove that 1a
(p)1...p2k
are -exact. the proof will be exemplied in the case p even, being similar if p
odd, and goes as follows. we start with the last equation from (15),

formulas (1617) restore the -exactness of the investigated quantities. more-
over, we cannot nd -closed expressions involving  
due to the
irreducibility of the gauge transformations (2) and (5). in conclusion, the
above antield spectrum is enough to enforce the acyclicity of , so we do
not need to introduce antields with resolution degrees higher that two. in
this way, the acyclicity of  is fully guaranteed within our irreducible ap-
proach, hence, as explained above, we can replace the quantization of the
reducible model with the one of the irreducible theory.

in order to x the gauge, we recall formula (11), which actually shows how
the ghosts remove the unphysical degrees of freedom.
indeed, we can re-
gard the functions 1...p2k1
like some elds with the gauge transforma-
, where 1...p2k1
tions 1...p2k1

(p)s are purely gauge. then, it is natural to take the gauge conditions

it is easy to check that the gauge-xed action (20) possesses no residual gauge
invariances. the formula (20) is the nal output of our irreducible procedure
for abelian free p-form gauge elds. it establishes that one can consistently
quantize free abelian p-forms without introducing either ghosts of ghosts or
their antields. at the same time, we remark that our approach outlines
some good gauge conditions with a direct physical content. these conditions
appear in the reducible procedure from the necessity of implementing some
irreducible lorentz type gauge conditions.

as can be seen from (5), our procedure activates some of the ineective
gauge transformations implied within the reducible treatment. then, it ap-
pears legitimate the question whether we can make eective all the ineective

7

(3) = [  ]

(3) and further 

(3) = (3) + 2

gauge transformations. the answer is however negative. we show this in the
simple case of three-form gauge elds, the general proof following a similar
line. the gauge invariances of abelian three-forms, a
(3) , become
ineective if one takes 
(3) = (3). accordingly
our method, only the gauge transformations with the parameters 
(3) = (3)
become eective via a
(3). in order to make also eective
the transformations with the gauge parameters 
(3), it is necessary
(3) = [  ]
(3),
respectively, a(3) = 
(3). the gauge transformations of the theory with
three-, two-, one-, and zero-form gauge elds are irreducible. however, this
new irreducible system does not describe the same physical observables like
those of free abelian three-form gauge elds. this can be seen by writing
down the equations associated with the physical observables of the irreducible
theory, namely, 3 f
= 0.

helps us at recovering the equivalence between the original and the new model
at the level of physical observables. a new problem appears now, namely,
the acyclicity of the koszul-tate operator. indeed,  is no longer acyclic. on
behalf of the denitions of  acting on the antields, we nd at the resolu-
tion degree equal with two the -closed quantities [  
(3)
denote the antields corresponding to the gauge parameters 
(3) . in change,
these quantities are not -exact. this signalizes that the part of the gauge
transformations for a
is vanishing under the
(3) = [  ]
change 
(3) s, which means
that some reducibility is present. thus, if we try to make physically equiv-

(3) involving the parameters 
(3) with arbitrary non-vanishing 

(3) ], where  

(3)

alent the two theories, then we lose the irreducibility, and, conversely, if we
ensure the irreducibility, the two systems are no longer physically equivalent.
in consequence, one cannot make eective all the ineective gauge transfor-
mations, and, at the same time, enforce the irreducibility. this argues the
introduction only of the elds a1...p2k
with the gauge transformations (5).
with the above analysis at hand, we are ready to investigate the ir-
reducible brst quantization of gauge theories with abelian p-form gauge
elds involving interacting terms that are gauge invariant under (2). these
terms may increase the derivative order of the eld equations because the
lagrangian density contains only the eld strengths and their derivatives.1
for deniteness, we begin with a gauge theory described by the action

involves all the consistent inter-
action terms invariant under the gauge transformations of the type (2) for
every pa. the theory described by (21) can be quantized in an irreducible
manner accordingly the approach to free p-forms discussed earlier. in this
light, for every pa > 1 (abelian one-forms are irreducible) we add the elds
a1...pa2k
, k = 1, . . . , apa,
and require the gauge transformations of the type (5). although we investi-
gate an interacting theory, the analysis goes almost identically with the free
case for every sort of original elds because the reducibility functions of the
interacting theory contain diagonal blocks. the only dierence resides in the
action of the koszul-tate operator on the initial elds, as the interaction
terms may add some new terms to the free equations of motion. this does
not aect the analysis from the free case, as the new equations of motion
satisfy the same noether identities like in the absence of interaction. hence,
the proof of the physical equivalence (at the level of observables) between
the reducible and irreducible theories, respectively, the acyclicity of the irre-
ducible koszul-tate operator remains unchanged. with these considerations
at hand, it is simply to see that the gauge-xed action reads

of (20), with p  pa. the gauge-xing fermion on account of which we reach
pa, with pa like in (19). the derivation of the gauge-
xed action (22) completes our treatment. at this point, we mention that
our irreducible lagrangian investigation of interacting p-form gauge theories
is advantageous as compared with a hamiltonian analysis because sl
i may
contain higher-order derivative terms which overwhelm both the canonical
approach and the construction of some irreducible rst-class constraints.

to conclude with, in this paper we proved that gauge theories with abelian
p-form gauge elds can be quantized along an irreducible antield brst
fashion. the cornerstone of our approach is given by the construction of
an irreducible gauge theory in a way that makes legitimate the replacement
of the reducible antield-brst quantization with the irreducible one. the
acyclicity of the irreducible koszul-tate operator was explicitly emphasized,
and also the equivalence between the irreducible and reducible theories at the
level of physical observables was completely elucidated. at the same time,
our formalism leads to some gauge conditions allowing a meaningful physical
interpretation. our results will be used in a next paper at the investigation
of the deformation of the master equation [18] for gauge theories with abelian
p-forms, and also at solving appropriately some cohomological aspects linked
with such theories.
