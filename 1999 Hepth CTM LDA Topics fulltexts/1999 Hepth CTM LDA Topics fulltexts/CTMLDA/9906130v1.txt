abstract

in this article, we study the q-state potts random matrix models extended to
branched polymers, by the equations of motion method. we obtain a set of loop
equations valid for any arbitrary value of q. we show that, for q = 2  2 cos l
r 
(l, r mutually prime integers with l < r ), the resolvent satises an algebraic
equation of degree 2r  1 if l + r is odd and r  1 if l + r is even. this generalizes
the presently-known cases of q = 1, 2, 3. we then derive for any 0  q  4 the
potts-q critical exponents and string susceptibility.

1 introduction

random matrix models [1] have proven to be a powerful mathematical tool for the
study of statistical physics systems on a uctuating two dimensional lattice [2].
in
particular, the potts model [3] on a random lattice [4], which was rst partially solved
by daul [5], has received a recent renewed interest [6, 7] due to new approaches to the
problem. it is a q-matrices model where all the matrices are coupled to each other,
which prevents one from using the formula [8, 9] to integrate out the relative angles
between the matrices (they no longer are independent variables) and deal with the
eigenvalues only.
in this paper we use the equations of motion method which does
not involve integration over angular variables. we obtain non-trivial loop equations
relating even moments to odd moments of a single matrix mi, and we show how to
extend these relations to the case of potts-q plus branched polymers (gluing of surfaces).
such relations (which could not be obtained by previous methods [5, 6]) are needed to
apply the renormalization group method [10] to potts-q models with added branching
interactions, which is hoped to provide an understanding of the c = 1 (q = 4) barrier.
we obtain an o(n)-like equation, the solution of which is known [11] and involves
elliptical functions [12]. what was the resolvent in the o(n) model, however, is now
(up to some transformations) the functional inverse of the potts-q resolvent, with n
replaced by 2 q. when q = 2 2 cos() with  rational, the general elliptic solution
degenerates into an algebraic function. it has already been observed [6, 7] that for the
particular cases of q = 1, 2 or 3, the resolvent obeys an algebraic equation of degree 2,
3, 5 respectively. in this article, we will derive from the value of , for any rational
q, the degree of the algebraic equation obeyed by the potts-q resolvent. we will also
derive the potts-q critical exponent for general values of q, which agrees with dauls
[5] expression.

2 the potts-q matrix model

the potts-q model with branching interactions (which appear if one wants to apply
the renormalization group method) is dened by the partition function:

z = z dm1 . . . dmq en 2pi

when u = 1 and c is a constant, this reduces to the ordinary potts-q model.

which do not depend on the indices provided i 6= j 6= k. the function f (z, z) and
f (z, z) are thus symmetric:

f (z, z) = f (z, z)

,

f (z, z) = f (z, z)

we will also dene:

f (z) = w (z)  gz2 + (c  u)z

recall that u and c can be general functions of the numbers h tr m 2

3 equations of motion

we are going to work in the large n (planar) limit, where we have the factorization
property: h tra trbi = h traih trbi [13]. the following changes of variables in eq. (2.1)
then give the following equations:

 m1 = 1

g(z2w (z)  z  t1) + u(zw (z)  1) + c(q  1) w (z) = w 2(z)

u (zf (z, z)  w (z))
c (zf (z, z)  w (z))

c(q  2) f (z, z)

(3.2)

= w (z)f (z, z)

substracting eq. (3.2) with (z  z), and using eq. (2.3) we can get rid of f in

eq. (3.2):

(f (z)  f (z))f (z, z) = g(cid:16)zw (z)  zw (z) + w (z)  w (z)  uw (z) + uw (z)(cid:17)(3.3)
in particular, if we choose z such that f (z) = f (z) and z 6= z, then we have:

(z  u)w (z)  (z  u)w (z) + w (z)  w (z) = 0

(3.4)

2

eq. (3.1) allows us to eliminate w , and we then have an equation involving only

w or equivalently f :

( f (z) = f (z)
c (z + z  u  q c

1

g )f (z) = (z + z)2  qzz  (2  q)u(z + z) + (1  q)u2  1

c
(3.5)

this seemingly dicult non-local equation is sucient to compute f (z) .

let us rst study it perturbatively. when z  , we have f (z)  gz2, thus
z  z. if we expand z(z) in powers of z by solving f (z) = f (z) perturbatively,
then insert this expansion into the second equation of eq. (3.5), we obtain a set of
equations of motion, the rst of which are:

gt2 + (cq  gu)t1 = 0
g2t4 + g(cq  2gu)t3  gu(cq  2gu)t2  g(gu3 + 2)t1 + c(1  q) + gu = 0

. . .

(3.6)

with tk = h tr m k
i /ni. let us recall that, in the general case, u and c are functions of
t2 and t1,1 = tr mimj/n. however, we can compute t1,1 thanks to eq. (3.1) in function
of the tks:

c(q  1)t1,1 + gt3 + ut2  1 = 0

finally, our equations, contrary to ordinary equations of motion, allow us to relate
even traces of a given matrix mi to odd traces of the same matrix .

only even traces appear as the higher order traces in these equations. let us explain
2 ti1/zi, the

why. if we write the expansion of f (z) as: f (z) = gz(z  u) + 1/z +p
zi coecient of the f (z)  f (z) = 0 equation reads, as z = z + u + . . .:

((1)i  1) ti1 + (1)i1 (i  1) ti2 u + . . . = 0

thus, our loop equations give us a relation between the even and odd parts of f (z),
and f (z) can be completely determined by the requirement that it has only one cut in
the physical sheet (i.e. f (z) is regular along this cut).
finally, let us stress that these equations of motion, which are valid for branched
polymers, are a precious tool whenever one wants to study potts-q models by the
renormalization group method [10].

4 correspondence with the o(n) model

let us now see how to deal with a non-local equation such as eq. (3.5).

the function z(z) dened above maps one solution of the equation f (z) = y on

another. it is involutive in the sense of multivaluated functions. we have:

let z0 be a xed point:

z(z(z)) = z

z(z0) = z0

3

and f0 = f (z0).

then let us set

 = qf0  f

() = z() +

1
c

1
4  q

( 2  f0  (2  q)cu)

and consider z as a function of . then we have z = z() and z() is regular at
 = 0. let us set

eq. (3.5) rewritten in term of () is now an o(n)-like quadratic equation:

2() + 2() + (2  q)()() = r()

(4.1)

where the right-hand side of the equation is an even polynomial of degree 4. the
similarity between potts-q and the o(n) model had already been noted [5, 6], but it
had always been said to be unphysical. we shall show here how one can relate the
results for the o(n) model to those for potts-q.

eq. (4.1) can be

solved exactly, as in the case of the o(n) model [11]. here,
we will assume for simplicity that () has only one physical cut [a, b] with ab >
0. let us denote q = 2  2 cos(), with 0    1. then we have, by writing
r( + i0)  r(  i0) = 0:
(( + i0)  (  i0))(( + i0) + (  i0) + 2 cos()()) = 0
thus we have the linear equation:

for a    b

( + i0) + (  i0) + 2 cos()() = 0

(4.2)

the general solution for () is known and can be expressed with elliptical functions.
it degenerates, in the rational case (i.e. when  is rational), into the solution of an
algebraic equation. however, () is not the resolvent of the model as it is in the
o(n) model. indeed, it is rather the functional inverse of the resolvent for the potts-q
model, up to some transformations. thus, the phase diagrams and critical exponents
of potts-q, as expected, are not the same as for the o(n) model.

5 rational case

here we will assume that  is rational:  = l/r where l and r are relatively prime
integers. we rst recall how to obtain eq. (5.4), which is an algebraic equation for
() [11].

if we denote +() = e

reads

and eq. (4.2) becomes:

i

2 ()+e i

2 () and () = +() , then eq. (4.1)
(5.1)

+()() = r()

+( + i0) = ei (  i0)

( + i0) = ei +(  i0)

(5.2)

4

if () is dened by:

+ = r ei( (+1)

2

)

then we have

 = r ei( (+1)

2

)

and

eq. (5.2) shows that

r cos()

sin 

() = 

s() =

1
2

(r

+ + (1)r+lr
)

(5.3)

has no cut, and behaves as a polynomial at innity (as does ()), i.e. it is a polynomial.
we thus have the algebraic equation for (z):

s() = r()

r

2 e i(r+l)

2

tr(

() sin()

qr()

)

(5.4)

where tr is the order r chebychev polynomial: tr(cos ) = cos r.

let us now examine the degree of this equation. it is polynomial in  and , but
we have to keep in mind that the resolvent of our problem is not (), but w (z) =

f (z) + gz(z  u), with  = f0  f and  = z  1

c(4q)(f + (2  q)cu).

the right-hand side of eq. (5.4), seen as a polynomial in  and z, is even and of

order 2r in , thus it is also a polynomial in f .

as for the left-hand side of the equation, s() veries s() = (1)r+l s(), thus,
when r + l is odd, we have to take the square of eq. (5.4) to have our nal algebraic
equation for f which should be of degree 2r. when r + l is even, however, eq. (5.4) is
already polynomial in f , and the degree of the equation should be r.

moreover, it is easy to check that the order 2r terms on both sides of eq. (5.4) are

the same. finally, the degree d in f (z) of the nal equation is:

d = 2r  1 if r + l
d = r  1 if r + l

is odd
is even

while it is of degree d + 1 in z.
this formula generalizes the presently known results [6, 7]:

for  = 1/3, q = 1, and d = 2
for  = 1/2, q = 2, and d = 3
for  = 2/3, q = 3, and d = 5

(5.5)

(5.6)

in [6], the author investigated the dilute potts-1,2,3, and 4 cases by the saddle point
method. these models coincide, when there is no dilution, with the particular case of
our models with no branching interactions. this gave rise to algebraic equations when
q 6= 4 which correspond to our results. however, no general result was given. in [7], the

5

author used the equations of motion to solve potts-3 with branching interactions, as
well as for the resolution of potts-. but, there again, there was no general expression.
we are now going to derive the general potts-q exponent from eq. (4.1). if, when
() is singular (i.e.  is close to one of the bounds of the physical cut of ), () is
not, then  cannot have more complex singularities than half-integer exponents. thus,
whereas in the generic case the physical cut [a, b] veries ab > 0, when the model is
at the potts critical point, a (or b) is equal to zero. this means that the bound of
the unphysical semi-innite cut we have suppressed by changing variables from f to

 = f0  f coincides in that case with the physical cut.

let us express: () = c() + regular part eq. (4.1) shows immediately that

the regular part is equal to zero, and that

e2i + 1 + 2 cos() ei = 0

i.e.

2  2 cos() = q = 2 + 2cos()

thus

and

as we expect the exponent for f to be greater than one, we have the exponent
for f and the string exponent, using [14]s formula, is:

6 conclusion

in this article, we have obtained general loop equations for the potts-q model extended
to branched polymers, which allow us to relate the even and odd parts of the resolvent.
this relation is then equivalent to an o(n)-like equation, from which we derived the
potts critical exponents and the degree of the algebraic equation which appears in the
rational case. this last result generalizes the known results for q = 1, 2 and 3 [6, 7] to
any q = 2 2 cos(l/r ) with l < r integers. moreover, such loop equations as we have
obtained are necessary when one wishes to apply the renormalization group techniques
to potts-q. the study of the renormalization group ows near q = 4 may then provide
us with useful information about the c = 1 transition. since q =  is a real c = 
model [15] and the orders of the phase transitions dier between the at and random
surface potts models, we may nd for large q a set of real c > 1 models.

let us also stress that the equations of motion method may be used when n is nite
i.e. on non-planar surfaces, in contrast to the saddle point method. furthermore, they
are also less dependent on the analytic structure of the resolvent than the saddle point
method of [5, 6]. finally, as we know how to solve the o(n) model exactly for general
values of n, we hope to be soon able to obtain the general expression of the potts-q
free energy and operators for any value of q.
