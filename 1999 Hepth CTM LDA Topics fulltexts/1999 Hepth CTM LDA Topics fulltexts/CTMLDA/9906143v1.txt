abstract

we show that on threedimensional riemannian manifolds with-
out boundaries and with trivial rst real de rham cohomology group
(and in no other dimensions) scalar eld theory and maxwell theory
are equivalent: the ratio of the partition functions is given by the
raysinger torsion of the manifold. on the level of interaction with
external currents, the equivalence persists provided there is a xed
relation between the charges and the currents.

there has been recent interest in relating dierent theories and establishing
their equivalence. common to all applications of the dierent aspects of the
notion of duality is the observation that when two dierent theories are dual
to each other, then either the manifolds are changed or the elds and the
coupling constants are related.
in this paper we re-examine two simple systems  scalar eld theory and
maxwell theory on threedimensional riemannian manifolds without bound-
aries and with trivial 1(m). we show the equivalence between these theories
and we give the condition which must be satised by the charges and the
external currents in order that the equivalence persists at the level of in-
teractions. this is done by a direct calculation of the partition function of
each theory paying particular attention to the ne structure of the zero
mode sector. in the spirit of schwarzs method of invariant integration [1]
we show that the ratio of the partition functions of the theories is equal to
the square of the partition function of chernsimons theory (or the partition
function of bf theory, that is, u(1)u(1) chernsimons theory with purely
o-diagonal coupling). such equivalence between a scalar and vector theory
is a novel form of duality which we call abelian duality. we show that when
the coupling constants (overall scaling factors) are related as r  1/r ,
then this abelian duality transforms into r  1/r duality. in this case
the ratio of the partition functions is given by a topological invariant  the
raysinger torsion of the manifold. we show how our results can be obtained
by schwarzs resolvent method [2] and we use a resolvent generated by the
de rham complex to comment on possibilities of equivalence between the
theories in other dimensions. in our considerations we use zetaregularised
determinants.

we will consider riemannian manifolds m. all operators entering our theory
can be described by the following diagram:

p(m)




mp(m)

dp

 p+1(m)

d
mp1




 mp1(m)

(1)

where m = dim m. the case of interest will be a three-dimensional manifold.

2

we will rst calculate the partition function of free maxwell theory:

z1(1) =

=

1(m )

z

z

da e i 1rd3x g f f 
da e i 1 hd1a, d1ai = z

1(m )

= z

1(m )

da e i 1r d1a   d1a

da e i 1 ha, d

1d1ai.

(2)

1(m )

dr(m) (i.e.

dr(m) is isomorphic to h1

note that here we have written f as d1a. the maxwell equation d2f = 0
implies that f is an element in h2
dr(m). a is a one-form and therefore
d1a = 0 in h2
dr(m), that is, if f = d1a then the equivalence class [f ] is
[f ] = [f ]  f = f  + d1a). when the second
zero in h2
de rham cohomology group is trivial, then f = d1a is valid globally. in
three dimensions h2
dr(m) due to hodge duality
and h1
dr(m) being trivial means that the rst homotopy group 1(m) is
trivial (then f = d1a globally). if 1(m) is non-trivial, then f = d1a is
valid only on contractible regions of the manifold.
we will show the equivalence between maxwell theory and scalar eld theory
for the case when f could be written as d1a globally, that is, for homology
3-spheres (cid:16)i.e. manifolds with trivial rst real de rham cohomology group,
e.g. s3 or the lens spaces l(p, q)(cid:17). for the general case the duality is more
subtle and we would like to refer the reader to [3] where witten has shown
how to pass from scalar eld theory to maxwell theory and vice versa in two
and three dimensions.
we need manifolds without boundaries because we want to integrate by parts
to bring the dierential operator d1 on the other side of the scalar product
and at the same time not to be bothered about boundary terms.
we need riemannian manifolds, because we are dealing with partition func-
tions.
the integral is over the space of all 1-forms 1(m). we can decompose the
space of all 1-forms as a direct sum of the kernel of the operator entering the
partition function and its orthogonal complement:
1(m) = kerd1  (kerd1).

(3)

therefore
z1(1) = vol(kerd1) z

(ker d1)

da e i 1 ha, d

1d1ai = vol(kerd1) det(cid:16) i1



d1d1(cid:17)1/2

.

(4)
the partition function is thus an ill-dened quantity  the determinant and
the volume factor are innite. our calculations will be formal. with a zeta
regularization technique we can make the determinant nite. we can also

3

asssume that an appropriate normalization is chosen in such way that the
divergency of the volume factor is absorbed. this will make the partition
function nite.
note that vol(kerd1) is nothing else but the faddeevpopov ghost determi-
nant times the ghostforghost determinant. to see that, let us calculate
the same partition function using the method of invariant integration [1]. in
other words we will exploit the gauge symmetry of the theory to restrict the
integration over 1(m) to integration over a lower-dimensional space  the
space of the orbits of the group of gauge transformation.
the stabilizer of the group of gauge transformations a  a + d00(m)
consists of those elements of 0(m) for which d00(m) = 0, that is, the
constant functions. in order to pick one representative of each equivalence
class [a], we impose a gauge condition, that is, we intersect the space of the
orbits of the group of gauge transformations in the space of all 1-forms by
a hyperplane dened by those as, for which a = 0, i.e. d0a = 0. the
integration is then performed over this hyperplane. we can always make
sure that the element at each intersection point of a group orbit with this
hyperplane is not a zeromode of the operator. thus, the faddeevpopov
trick not only restricts the gauge freedom, but also isolates the zeromodes
of the operator. the faddeevpopov determinant is a delta function of the
gauge-xing condition (lorentz gauge in our case).
in addition we must
multiply by the volume of each orbit in order to preserve the value of the
partition function. that is, we must divide by the volume of the stabilizer
of the group at each point (we have assumed that the volume of the group
of gauge transformations is normalized to one). this volume factor is the
ghostforghost determinant  as the faddeevpopov determinant is not
nite [4]  d0 itself has zeromodes (it vanishes on the constant functions).
so we need an analogue of the gauge-xing condition  this time for the
ghosts, not for the elds.
assuming that all stabilizers are conjugate, we get:

z1(1) =

1

vol(kerd0)

1(m )/d0

z

d[a] e i 1 ha, d

1d1ai det (d0d0)1/2.

(5)

the stabilizer of the group of gauge transformations consists of the constant
functions, that is, the stabilizer is the real line. the real line can be canon-
ically identied with the zeroth de rham cohomology group h0
dr(m). the
projection map kerdq  hq

dr(m) induces the isomorphism [4]:

q : hq(m)  hq

dr(m)

(6)

4

where hq(m) is the space of harmonic q-forms. therefore:
dr(m)(cid:17).

vol(cid:16)hq(m)(cid:17) = |detq|1 vol(cid:16)hq

so the volume of the stabilizer is:

vol(kerd0) = det(00)1/2 vol(cid:16)h0(m)(cid:17).

(7)

(8)

the volume of the orbit of the group is proportional to the ghostforghost
determinant det (00) that extracts the zero modes from the faddeevpopov
ghost determinant det (d1d1). the ghostforghost determinant is equal to
the inverse of the volume of the manifold [4]:

det(00)1 = vol(m).

(9)

now we will extract the complex scaling factor i1
terminant. following [5] we can write:

 from the functional de-

det(cid:16)i1



d1d1(cid:17)1/2

= e i

4 (0, d

2 (0, d

1d1)

1d1) (cid:18) 1

 (cid:19) 1

det (d1d1)1/2 .

(10)

thus the partition function of maxwell theory is given by:

z1(1) = e i

4 (0, d

2 (0, d

1d1)

1d1) (cid:18) 1

 (cid:19) 1

vol(m)1/2
vol(cid:16)h0(m)(cid:17)

det (d0d0)1/2
det (d1d1)1/2

.

(11)

we now use the fact that on odd-dimensional and two-dimensional manifolds
there are no poles in the function near s = 0. this can be seen using
seeleys formula [6] for the -function of some laplace-type operator l on a
d-dimensional manifold without a boundary:

(s, l) =

1

(s)



xn=0

an

s + n  d

2

+

j(s)
(s)

,

(12)

where an are the heat-kernel co-ecients and j(s) is analytic. then
(0, p) = dimhp

dr(m). using the formula [5]:

(s, dpdp) = (1)p

p

xq=0

(1)q (s, q),

(13)

we nally get, modulo the phase factor:

z1(1) =  1

2 dim h0

dr(m)

det (d0d0)1/2 det (d1d1)1/2 .

(14)

vol(m)1/2
vol(cid:16)h0(m)(cid:17)

consider now the partition function of free scalar theory:

z0(0) =

=

d e i 0rd3x g   = z

d e i 0 hd0, d0i

0(m )

0(m )

0(m )

0(m )

d e i 0r d0   d0

d e i 0 h, d

0d0i.

we now decompose the space of all 0-forms 0(m) in a similar way:

0(m) = ker d0  (ker d0).

with this decomposition the partition function becomes:

(15)

(16)

z0(0) = vol(kerd0)

z

d e i 0 h, d

0d0i

(ker d0)

= e i

4 (0, d

2 dim h0

dr(m) vol(cid:16)h0(m)(cid:17)
vol(m)1/2

det (d0d0)1/2.(17)

modulo the phase factor we have:

z0(0) = 

1

2 dim h0

dr(m)

0

vol(cid:16)h0(m)(cid:17)
vol(m)1/2

det (d0d0)1/2 .

(18)

the product of the partition functions of the theories is:

z0(0)z1(1) = (cid:18)0
1(cid:19)

on the other hand we have:

1

2 dim h0

dr(m)

det (d1d1)1/2 .

(19)

z1(1) =  1

1

2 dim h0

dr(m)

vol(kerd1) det (d1d1)1/4 det (d1d1)1/4.

(20)

the hodge star operator is invertible and on threedimensional manifolds
we have: det (d1d1)1/2 = det (d1). (for these operators the multiplicative
anomaly vanishes.) thus (modulo a phase factor):

z1(1) =  1

1

2 dim h0

dr(m)

det (d1d1)1/4 vol(cid:16)ker (d1)(cid:17) det (d1)1/2 .

(21)

the last two factors in this formula are exactly the partition function of
chernsimons theory zcs. the partition function of chernsimons theory

6

is a topological invariant (modulo a phase factor [5]), given by the raysinger
torsion of the manifold [2]:

zcs(cs) =  1

cs

2 dim h0

therefore:

zcs(cs)(cid:19)2
(cid:18) z1(1)

dividing (23) by (19) we get:

r  1/r duality means that if the coupling constants (overall scaling
then both partition functions will depend
factors) are related as 0 = 1
on the coupling constants in the same way (one has to be careful, because
the coupling constants are not dimensionless). the ratio of the partition
functions (modulo an omitted phase factor) is a topological invariant  the
raysinger torsion of the manifold. therefore the two theories are equiva-
lent. for manifolds for which the raysinger torsion is one (s3 for instance),
the partition functions are equal.
note that both scalar eld theory and maxwell theory are non-topological in
three dimensions.
abelian duality

z1(1)
z0(0)

= z 2

cs(cid:16)q01 (cid:17)

is stronger than r  1/r duality
z1(1)
1(cid:17)
z0(cid:16) 1

= rs(m)

(25)

(26)

in the sense that if the coupling constants are not related as r  1/r ,
there is still a relation  the ratio of the partition functions is given by
the square of the partition function of chernsimons theory with coupling
constant cs = 10, that is, by the partition function of u(1)  u(1)

chernsimons theory with purely o-diagonal coupling (bf theory).

we can show the abelian duality by considering the following resolvent gen-
erated by the de rham complex:

0  ir

1

0 0(m)

d0 1(m)

d1 kerd1 = ker s1  0.

(27)

7

the rst cohomology group of the mainfold is trivial and we have:

if we denote by d0 the restriction of d0 over (kerd0), then the map

vol(kerd1) = vol(imd0).

implies:

d0 : (kerd0)  imd0

(28)

(29)

vol(imd0) = det (d0d0)1/2 vol(cid:16)(kerd0)(cid:17) = det (d0d0)1/2

vol(cid:16)0(m)(cid:17)
vol(kerd0)

.

(30)

we thus get:

vol(kerd1) = vol(cid:16)0(m)(cid:17) det (d0d0)1/2

1

vol(kerd0)

.

(31)

we have already seen that

vol(kerd0) = det(00)1/2 vol(cid:16)h0(m)(cid:17).

(32)

therefore the partition function of maxwell theory is given (modulo a phase
factor and with suitable normalization) by the same expression as (14).

to show that the abelian duality is a property of three dimensions only,
consider again the de rham complex. due to hodge duality, dmp1 =
 dp . therefore det (dmp1dmp1) = det (dpdp) and for evendimensional
manifolds all determinants involving the dierential operator cancel each
other.
in higher odd dimensions, it is possible to nd a relation between
scalar eld theory and maxwell theory, but there will be more determinants
coming in from the de rham complex, thus non-physical theories should also
be involved.

r  1/r duality can be shown in a dierent manner  by a duality
transformation. we will illustrate this by considering the following partition
function:

z = z

da e rr a   a = z

da e r ha, ai.

(33)

ker d1

ker d1

over the space of the kernel of the operator d1 we can locally write a = d0.
therefore z becomes the partition function of free scalar eld theory:

z = z

d e rr d0   d0.

0(m )

(34)

8

alternatively, we can replace the integral over the kernel of the operator d1
by an integral over 1(m) and include a lagrange multiplier b (cid:16)b  1(m)(cid:17)
to keep track of the fact that a is at:

z = z

da e rr a   a = z

da db e rr a   a + r b  d1a.

ker d1

1(m )

(35)

if we integrate over a and absorb the resulting determinant det (r1i) in the
normalization, we end up with the partition function of maxwell theory with
coupling constant 1/r:

z = z

1(m )

db e

1

r r d1b   d1b.

(36)

the same can be seen if we make a change in the variables in (35)  dual-
ization  a  a = a + 1
with this dualization the partition function becomes:

r  d1b.

z = z

da e rr a   a z

db e

1

r r d1b   d1b.

(37)

1(m )

1(m )

the integral over a is gaussian and can be absorbed in the normalization
factor. the remaining integral is the partition function of maxwell theory.

let us now include external currents j in maxwell theory and j in scalar
eld theory:
z1(j) = z

1d1ai + q hj, ai,

da eiha, d

da ei rd3x g (f f  +qja) = z
d ei rd3x g ( +ej) = z

1(m )

0(m )

1(m )

z0(j) = z

0(m )

d ei h, d

0d0i + e hj, i,(38)

where q and e are some charges.
now extract perfect squares and perform the gaussian integration to end up
with:

z0(j) = z0(j)  1/2

rs (m) exp(cid:18)ie hj,

1

d
0d0

ji(cid:19) exp(cid:18) iq hj,

1

d
1d1

ji(cid:19).

(39)

if the charges and the currents are related as:

j = ir q

e  d2 (d1 )1 j,

9

(40)

then the abelian duality will go through on the level of interactions with
external currents.
using the denition of correlation function (as a functional derivative of the
partition function with respect to the external current), we can easily relate
the correlation functions of scalar eld theory, maxwell theory and chern
simons theory.
we have recently shown [7] that the partition functions of maxwellchern
simons theory and the self-dual model dier by the partition function of
chernsimons theory (thus the two theories being equivalent). therefore,
the ratio of the partition functions of scalar eld theory and maxwell theory
is equal (modulo phase ambiguities) to the square of the ratio of the partition
functions of maxwellchernsimons theory and the self-dual model. we can
relate the correlation functions of these ve models as well.
finally we would like to mention that chernsimons theory can be dynam-
ically generated from the paritybreaking part of a theory with massive
fermions [8]  as gaugeinvariant regularization of the massless fermionic
determinant introduces parity anomaly given by the chernsimons theory.
in this sense, the result of our paper (24) implies that a theory with massive
fermions (interacting with external currents) together with massless scalar
elds (possibly iteracting with external currents) add up to maxwell theory
(with possible interaction with external currents). thus we have a form of
bosonization in three dimensions.
