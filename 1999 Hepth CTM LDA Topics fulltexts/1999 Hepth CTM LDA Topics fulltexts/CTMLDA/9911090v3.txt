abstract

we write down charged macroscopic string solutions in type ii string
theories, compactied on torii, and present an explicit solution of the
spinor killing equations to show that they preserve 1/2 of the type ii
supersymmetries. the s-duality symmetry of the type iib string theory
in ten-dimensions is used to write down the sl(2, z) multiplets of such
strings and the corresponding 1/2 supersymmetry conditions. finally we
present examples of planar string networks, using charged macroscopic
(p, q)-strings. an interesting feature of some of these networks, which
preserve 1/4 supersymmetry, is a required alignment among three param-
eters, namely the orientation of strings, a u(1) phase associated with the
maximal compact subgroup of sl(2, z), and an (angular) parameter as-
sociated with a solution generating transformation, which is responsible
for creating charges and currents on the strings.

1 introduction

the study of macroscopic string solutions [14] has been of importance in the last
decade in several contexts, such as in black-hole physics [5], strong/weak duality
applications [3, 68] etc. in the context of duality, they have been crucial in estab-
lishing several such symmetries of string theories. prominent among these are the
sl(2, z) duality [8] symmetries of the type iib string theory in ten dimensions and
a string-string duality between the type iia compactication on k3 and heterotic
string compactication on t 4 [3, 6, 7]. the support for the later conjecture involved
the construcation of certain bps solutions carrying (1-form) gauge eld charges.
such solutions for k3 compactied type iia theory were obtained using charged
macrscopic string solutions of the heterotic strings with 1/2 supersymmetry [3] and
then by mapping them to the type ii strings. in the former case, howerver, only a
neutral string solution was needed, as type iib in ten dimensions does not have any
1-form gauge potential. a full duality multiplet of such neutral string solutions and
the corresponding duality covaraint string tensions were also obtained in [8]. more re-
cently, sl(2, z) as well as other u-duality multiplets of neutral string solutions have
been used in constructing their networks with 1/4 [9], 1/8 [10] and lower supersym-
metries in type ii theories. they are also expected to provide further conrmations
of the duality conjectures.

the network solutions [922] of type ii strings have also found their applications
elsewhere, namely in providing nonperturbative symmetry enhancements in orien-
tifold models to show their matching with the f-theory predictions [19]. in addition,
strings and networks which end on d3-branes have found a wide application in 4-
dimensional gauge [20, 21, 23] and other world-volume theories [24].

the focus of attention in this paper are the charged macroscopic string solutions
[2, 3] and their networks. as stated earlier, these solutions have been used earlier
for constructing the soliton multiplets in type ii string compactication on k3 in
order to provide support for their duality conjecture with the heterotic theory on t 4.
in this paper, howerver, we will concentrate on such solutions in type ii theories,
when they are compactied on torii. as a result, a verication of supersymmetry
requires an analysis of additional killing equations than the ones which are present
in the heterotic strings, namely one has to examine the supersymmetry conditions
for the spinors arising from both the left and the right-moving sectors of the type ii
theories. in this paper we perform this analysis explicitly for a class of such charged
macroscopic string solutions which are analogous to the heterotic solutions presented
in [2]. we also write down explicit supersymmetry conditions for several other class
of examples in [3].

the charged macroscopic string solutions are generated from the neutral ones
by a solution generating transformation and are in general parameterized by a group
o(d  1, 1; d  1, 1), arising out of one time and d  1 spatial translational isometries
of the solution. these parameters also appear in the charged macroscopic string

1

solutions. in particular, the solutions in [3] are characterized by two nontrivial o(d
1, 1; d  1, 1) parameters  and , which apply boost between the time direction
and an internal direction in the left and the right-moving sectors respectively. the
solutions of [2], which we use to explicitly show the 1/2 supersymmetric nature of
these solutions in section-2 correspond to  = 0, but  6= 0. our analysis then
suggests that general solutions ( 6= 0,  6= 0) also preserve 1/2 supersymmetry.
our results show that o(d  1, 1; d  1, 1) transformations parameterized by 
and  change the killing equations in a nontrivial way. as a result, the supersym-
metry conditions and the form of the killing spinors is also modied. however both
the supersymmetry conditions and the killing spinors for the charged string can be
generated from those for the neutral ones by lorentzian tranformations. the pa-
rameters of these lorentz transformations turn out to be local, having a coordinate
dependence on the transverse radius. the experience gained from this analysis (for
 = 0 ) can in fact be used to write down the supersymmetry condition for other
solutions characterized by parameters  and . in view of our future application, in
section-3 we conrm the 1/2 supersymmetry property of  =  and  =  solutions
by examining the consistency of the dilatino supersymmetry variation for the charged
macroscopic string background. we also show that one of the above solutions, namely
 = , when decompactied to ten dimensions, is related to the neutral string so-
lutions by a constant coordinate transformation. this is not surprising, as o(d, d)
group is known to contain a gl(d) subgroup of constant coordinate transformations.
the other possibility, namely  =  that we have analyzed is an inequivalent so-
lution even in ten-dimensional sense. this can be veried from the expression for
the dilaton, which is now dierent from the one for the neutral string. however we
like to point out that even  =  solutions are in fact physically dierent in the
compactied theory and represent genuine charged strings in d  9.
we then use the sl(2, z) duality symmetries of the type iib theories in ten
dimensions to generate general (p, q)-charged macroscopic string solutions from the
(1, 0) or elementary-string solution discussed above. in particular we show that the
supersymmetry conditions for both  =  6= 0 soultions are of a form which allow
the constructon of string networks preserving 1/4 supersymmetry. this is not sur-
prising for the  =  solution for the reason already stated in the last paragraph.
as a result, the 1/4 supersymmetry of these networks already follows from that of
the netutral planar string networks that exist in various dimensions. in this case, we
nd that the internal torii do not play any signicant role and the string networks
can be constructed by aligning the orinetation of the (p, q)-string, in a plane, with
respect to a phase associated with the transformation of spinors under the sl(2, z)
duality symmetry transformation.

the charged string solutions with  =  turn out to be more interesting from the
supersymmetry point of view for the construction of networks. we nd that in this
case a network construction, preserving certain supersymmetry, requires not only an
alignment between the two angles discussed above, but in addition, one has to fur-

2

ther align them with an angle coming from the soultion generating parameter. in our
examples, in section (4.3), these strings carry not only the 2-form charges parame-
terized by integers (p, q) and moduli  , but also by gauge charges characterized by a
2-dimensional unit vector n. physically, this alignment therefore implies a coupling
between the sl(2) charges with that of the gauge charges and also a relationship
between their conservation laws.

the outline of the paper is as following. in section-2 we write down the general
charged string solution in arbitrary dimensions. then to work out the supersymmetry,
we restrict to a specic case, namely  = 0 and present the killing spinors for this
example. although our analysis is performed specically in 9-dimensions, we present
the generalizations of the results to other lower dimensions as well. in section-3 of
the paper, we write down explicit supersymmetry conditions for  =  6= 0 and
 =  6= 0. once again we show that our background elds satisfy a nontrivial
condition required for the consistency of these spinor equations. again the derivations
are given explicitly in 9-dimensions and then generalized to the lower ones. in section-
4, following [8], we also write the sl(2, z) multiplets of the charged macroscopic
strings and show the existence of network solutions for the examples worked out
in section-3. this is done by demonstrating the existence of a unique spinor at
aymptotic innity, satisfying the supersymmetry conditions for arbitrary number of
(p, q)-strings, provided the alignments we referred previously, also hold. discussions
and conclusions are presented in section-5.

(2.1) bosonic backgrounds

we start by writing down the bosonic backgrounds associated with the charged
macroscopic strings in space-time dimensions d. they have been obtained from
similar solutions for the heterotic strings [3], by turning o the sixteen gauge elds
associated with the right-moving, bosonic sector. this is possible since this sector
of the heterotic string is identical to the ns-ns sector of type ii theories in ten
dimensions. the solution is given by,

with n(a), p(a) being the components of (10  d)-dimensional unit vectors. as in
eqns. (4), (5) are the gauge elds appearing due to the kaluza-klein (kk) reductions
of the ten dimensional metric and the 2-form antisymmetric tensor coming from the
ns-ns sector. the matrix md parametrizes the moduli elds. the exact form of
this parametrization depends on the form of the o(10 d, 10 d) metric used. the
above solution has been written for a diagonal metric of the form:

ld = (cid:18)i10d

i10d(cid:19) .

(10)

later on, while decompactifying these backgrounds, in order to check supersym-
metry, we will use the notations and conventions in [25] which uses a dierent form
of the metric, namely:

l = (cid:18)

i10d

i10d

(cid:19) .

these two conventions are howerver related by:

ld = p l p t , md = p m p t ,

where

p =

i10d(cid:19) .

the gauge elds in two conventions are related as:

with a1,2

sectors.

(14)

in this section we now restrict ourselves to the  = 0 solutions. these solutions

are analogous to the ones written for the hetrotic strings in [2] and are given by,

and constant c determining the string tension. 1

has been taken care in [2] in the denitions of charges.

now, in order to understand the type ii origin of various background elds and
to verify the supersymmetry of these solutions, we decompactify the above solution
back to ten dimensions. the decompactication exercise is done following a set of
notations given in [25]. when restricted to the ns-ns sector of type ii theories, they
can be written as:

[a+(d1),b+(d1)],

gab = g(10)

a(a)

 =

bab = b(10)

[a+(d1),b+(d1)],

we now start with a nine-dimensional (d = 9) solution in (15) and following the
kaluza-klein (kk) compactication mechanism summarized above, write down the
solution directly in ten dimensions. we do this rst for the d = 9 solution and later
in section-(2.4) generalize the results to d < 9. only nonzero background elds are
then given by

(20)

although it is already expected, we have also reconrmed that many of the eld
equations in ten-dimensions are satised by the backgrounds in eqns.
(18), (19),
(20).

we now study spinor killing equatoins for type iib strings in ten dimensions and
show that the solutions in (18)-(20) are consistent with 1/2 supersymmetry. we once
again emphasize that 1/2 supersymmetry from the type iib string point of view is
comparatively more nontrivial, than in the heterotic theory, due to the presence of
extra equations to be satised by the background conguration. later in section-(2.3)
we also nd the corresponding killing spinors.

6

(2.2) killing equations

the spinor killing equations in ten dimensions, when restricted to ns-ns elds,

follow from supersymmetry variations, (in string metric) [4, 27, 28]:

m = m  +

1
4

 m n
m  m n  

1
8

h m n

m  m n ,

 = (m (10))m

hm n p m n p ,

(21)

(22)

where m is the ten-dimensional gravitino,  the dilatino and   (l + ir) are the
supersymmetry parameters. m = 0, .., 9 are the general coordinate indices in ten
dimensions and m , n are the lorentz indices.

to analyze these equations for our nine-dimensional solution, we now denote the
indices (9, 0, 8) by greek indices . the corresponding lorentz indices are denoted
by  etc.. the indices, transverse to the string are denoted by m = 1, .., 7 and
the corresponding lorentz ones by ms etc.. the ten-dimensional lorentzian metric
for our purpose is taken to be of the form:  m n  diag.(1,1, 1, ..., 1) (with the
rst entry denoting the coordinate x9), which implies:  = (1,1, 1) and also
 mn =  mn. taking into account that the backgrounds depend only on transverse
coordinates denoted by ms through radius r, the gravitino supersymmetry variation
(21) can be written as:

m = m + 1

for the purpose of algebraic manipulations, we nd it convenient to write these

equations by introducing parameters:

(25)

and 3 3 matrices g, b and e 
 , where the metric g and the antisymmetric tensor
b can be read from the backgrounds in eqns.(18)-(20). e is the vielbein correponding
to g. in our case these 3  3 matrices can be written in terms of 2  2 matrices g,
b and e:

g = (cid:18) 1

bt g + bt b(cid:19) b = (cid:18) 0 b
bt b (cid:19)

b

(26)

with b  b(1, 1), a 2-dimensional row-vector. the vielbein e is given by:

e = (cid:18) 1

bt

0

e(cid:19)

(27)

and satises ee t = g, whereas e  et = g, with  being a diagnoal 2  2 matrix:
diag.(1, 1).
the 2 2 matrices g, b and e apprearing in eqns. (26), (27) have explicit forms:
g  (cid:18)g + a
(28)

g + a(cid:19) ,

a

and

e

g  a (cid:18) g  a 0
g(cid:19) .

(29)

(30)

note that g also represents the longitudinal part, or (0,8)-components, of the com-
pactied metric in d-dimensions, as seen directly from eqn.(15). similarly b is the
antisymmetric tensor in the compactied theory and e is the vielbein for the metric
g. using these notations we now start by simplifying the gravitino variation equation
for the transverse coordinates, m, namely eqn.(23).

the spin-connection matrix appearing in the r.h.s. of (23) in our case is given

by,  

m = 1

these can be used to show that six equations,  = 0, following from the real and
imaginary components of (35) reduce to only two independent ones with l and r
satisfying the following conditions:

(0 m  8 m) l = 0,
  2b,mg  a
g,m

9 m + (2

g  e,m)0 m + e,m8 m! r = 0.

(38)

(39)

finally the killing equations following from the variation of the dilatino can be

written down in the notations introduced above as:

 = m(10)m(l  ir) 

1
2

(e tg1b, mg1e)

 m (l + ir) = 0,

(40)

and using (32) gives:

 m(10) +

g,m

98! r = 0.

the last two expressions can also be written in an alternative form, using (25):

(l  ir) = [08 + tanh


2

ee/2(90  98)](l + ir),

(41)

(42)

(43)

which will be useful for discussions later on.

eqns. (33), (38) and (41) therefore provide complete set of conditions that the
killing spinors l have to satisfy. similarly eqns. (34), (39) and (42) are the conditions

9

to be satised by the killing spinors r. we also observe that the equations satised
by l are identical to the one for neutral strings. that is not surprising as the
o(d 1, 1; d 1, 1) transformation, used to generate solution (15) from neutral string
solutions, act as identity in this sector.
the derivation of equations satised by the spinors also pass several consistency
checks. first of these, as mentioned above, was the reduction of six equations in
(24) into only two in (38) and (39). moreover, the dilatino variation equations (41),
(42) are also equivalent to these. to show this, one simply has to multiply (39) by
(0  8) from left. as a result, one gets a single independent constraint for l,
and similarly for r. the equation involving a derivative on the spinors, (33) and
(34) are also seen to be consistent with these constraint equations. we demonstrate
this in section-(2.3) by obtaining a solution for l and r satisying all the equations
simultaneously. moreover in section-(2.3) we will also see that the nal constraints,
(39) or (42), satisfy certain consistency conditions on the eigen-values of operators
appearing in these equations.

(2.3) killing spinors

we now present the solution of the killing equations for spinors l and r. as
already stated, l satises the same condition as in the neutral case and corresponding
solution is also identical:

l = ee/40
l,

where 0

l is a constant spinor satisfying,

(1 + 08)0

l = 0.

(44)

(45)

the form of r is more nontrivial. this is also obvious from the killing equations
(34), (39) and (42) that they satisfy. we already noticed that the two non-derivative
equations (39) and (42) are in fact identical. as a result one nally has only two
equations to solve, namely (34) and (39). howerver before starting to solve these, we
rst show the self-consistency of (39) by writing it as:

 1 + (

2g,m
ge,m  1)08 +

2b,m

e,mg  a

98! r = 0,

and after substituting for g and b from equation (25) as:

2

98! r = r.

(46)

(47)

a nontrivial check on our algebra in the previous sub-sections, as well as about 1/2
supersymmetry of our solution comes from the fact that the particular combination

10

of matrices appearing in the l.h.s. of the above equation is idempotent, with only
eigen-values 1, as required for the validity of the above equation. this can be
checked by squaring the lhs of (47).
the derivative equation (34) can also be simplied for our backgrounds using (25),

(42), and can be written as:

where we have now changed variable from r  e(r).
we choose a basis for the ten dimensional dirac () matrices as in [26]:

now, to present an explicit solution of the killing equations: (47) and (48) for r

0 = i2  i16, 8 = 1  i16, 9 = 3  i16.

(49)

also, we choose r  r  0, with 0 an unconstrained sixteen-dimensional con-
stant spinor and r is now a representation of pauli-matrix algebra. then the nal
equations to solve are:

[i + 3 + tanh

(50)

(51)

where we have now used eqn.(42) instead of (39) or (47). the nal solution for the
killing spinor is:

(52)

r =

q(cosh2 

2 ee  sinh2 

2 ) (cid:18) cosh 

sinh 

2 ee/4
2 ee/4 (cid:19) .

this killing spinor reduces to the one for the neutral sting for  = 0, for which we
have

r  n

r = ee/4(cid:18) 1
0(cid:19) ,

and implies in our notations:

(1  08)n

r = 0.

(53)

(54)

we have therefore explicitly solved for the killing spinor and shown that a charged
macroscopic string solution given in equation (15) is 1/2 supersymmetric. the 1/2
supersymmetry comes from the fact that half the components of r are related to the
remaining ones as given in an explicit form in equation (52)

11

we now show that the supersymmetry conditions (47) and the killing spinors
(52) for the charged case are related to the neutral ones through a lorentz boost. for
this we parameterize the coecients of (08, 98) in equation (47) as (cosh,sinh)
respectively and note that for r in (52) satisfying this equation,

reduces to the expression (53) and satises (54), which is also the condition satised
by the killing spinor for the neutral strings ( =  = 0). therefore the 1/2 su-
persymmetry condition for a charged macroscopic string, namely (47), is related to
the one for neutral string by the action of a lorentz boost on the spinor r. this is
expected, as the solution (15) for the charged macroscopic string is also generted from
the neutral ones by a lorentz boost in the right-moving sector. howerver, we nd
it interesting to note that the action of this lorentz transformation on the spinors is
governed by a coordinate dependent parameter. only in the r   (e  0) limit,
this parameter reduces to the one for a global lorentz transformation. this is similar
to the phase transformation of spinors induced by an sl(2, z) s-duality transforma-
tion [29]. the transformation of the spinors are coordinate dependent under s-duality
tranformations as well, although like o(d 1, 1; d 1, 1) transformations, the sl(2)s
are themselves global.

(2.4) d < 9 solutions

so far we have restricted ourselves to d = 9. above analysis generalizes to the
charged macroscopic string solutions in d < 9 in a sraightforward manner with only
minor modications. using the kk procedure metioned in section-(2.1), we can once
again decompactify these solutions to ten dimensions. the resulting ten-dimensional
metric now has a block-diagonal form:

g(10) = 


i9d

g id2




,

(57)

with i9d representing an identity matrix for all the internal directions ranging from:
(xd+1, ..., x9) and id2 represents the tranverse space dimensions of the string in
cartesian coordinates. matrix g in eqn. (57) is similar to the one in (26) and is
now dened in a three dimensional space with coordinates (xd, x0, xd1), i.e., by
replacing in eqn.(26) the coordinates (x9, x8) by (xd, xd1). also, the explicit form

12

of g is similar to the one in (26) except e is now a d 2 dimensional greens funtion
(16). similarly, the antisymmetric tensor is represented by a matrix:

b(10) = 


0

b 0




.

(58)

the dilaton remains same as in the d-dimensional theory and is given by the same
expression as in (20) with e modied as in (16).

due to the block-diagonal form of the backgrounds that we have obtained, the su-
persymmetry analysis is exactly same as previously in this section. we have therefore
shown the 1/2 supersymmetry of the  = 0 solution in dimensions d  9. in next
section, we also work out the supersymmetry of certain  6= 0,  6= 0 solutions, in
order to nd a 1/4 supersymmetric network solution of charged macroscopic strings
later in section-4.

3 supersymmetry of ,  6= 0 solutions
in this section we write down the 1/2 supersymmetry conditions for cases:  = 
and  =  in equations (1)-(9). here we only write down the supersymmetry condi-
tions which are the analogs of (43) given earlier. these conditions will be generalized
to a maifestly sl(2, z)-covariant form later on. although the full solution of the
killing equations can also be obtained as in the last section, we do not present them
here.

(3.1)  =  6= 0 solutions

once again we rst discuss the solution in d = 9 and then generalize them to the

lower dimensional cases. the solution in d = 9 is now characterized by a metric:

ds2 = 

1

1 + ccosh2

r5

dt2 +

the only non-zero component of the antisymmetric tensor is of the form

(59)

(60)

we also have a nontrivial modulus parametrizing the o(1, 1) matrix md in eqn.(6):

g99  g =

1 + ccosh2

r5
1 + c

13

(61)

the two gauge elds appearing in equations (17), (14) for d = 9 are of the form:

a1

8 = 0,

a2

t = 0,

8 = csinh

(62)

(63)

the supersymmetry property of the above solution is obtained in the same manner
as in section (2.1), after decompactifying the 9-dimensional backgrounds back to ten
dimensions. the background elds in ten dimensions for  =  case are now
represented by 3  3 matrices analogous to the ones in (26):

the 1/2 supersymmetry conditions is now obtained from the dilatino variation
(22), although other equations are expected to give the same answer as well. we once
again need to compute the matrix h

a form:

once again consistency of this equation is seen by observing that the matrix appearing
in the rhs of (68) is idempotent.

in the present case the 1/2 supersymmetry of the charged string, as well as that
of the corresponding networks that will be discussed in section-4, can be argued in
another way as well. as pointed out earlier, the solution generating transformations
contain the group of constant coordinate transformations as a subgroup. one can
show that  =  solutions belong to this category. for this we note that the metric
and antisymmetric tensors in the ten-dimensional theory, after decompactication,
are related to the neutral string solutions as:

g = g0t , b = b0t ,

where g0 and b0 are the ten-dimensional backgrounds for the netutral strings:

we however like to point out that althought the two solutions are related by the
above transformation, they are still physically dierent in the compactied theory.
the generation of charged solutions through decompactication and constant coordi-
nate transformations are known, including for many examples of black holes such as
reissner-nordstrom from scharzschild etc.. the transformations (69) in our case only
points out that many of the classical properties, including supersymmetry are iden-
tical in two theories. in next sub-section we will write down the 1/2 supersymmetry
of the charged macrocopic strings for  =  case. these are inequivalent solutions
with resepct to the neutral ones even in ten dimensions.

the generalization of the supersymmetry condition (68) to d < 9 is once again
stratighforward and follows a similar path as in section-(2.4). as long as the unit
vectors n(a) and p(a) in eqns. (4), (5) are chosen to be along a single internal di-
rection, say xd, only modication in (68) comes in the power of r which is asso-
ciated with the green function in the tranverse directions, in addition to replacing
(9, 8)  ( d,  d1). a more interestring case is when we parameterize them by
angular variables as n(a) = p(a)  (cos, sincos, ...), in (10  d)-dimensional in-
ternal space. then 9 in eqn.(68) is replaced by an orthogonal combination of 
matrices in (10  d) internal dimensions: 9  n. we will exploit this property in

15

an eight-dimensional example in section-(4.2) to show the existence of network type
solutions.

(3.2)  =  solutions

in this case the background metric and antisymmetric tensors are identical to the

one in (59). the modulus eld is now given by,

g =

r5

1 + ccosh2

finally the components of the gauge elds are now:

(77)

(78)

the inequivalence of the charged solution with respect to the netutral ones can be
seen by observing that the form of the dilaton in eqn.(78) is now dierent from that
in (66). a comparison of gs in (73) and (61) implies that  =  solutions are t -dual
with respect to  =  ones. property of supercharges under t -duality has been
studied in [28, 30]. we however obtain the 1/2 supersymmetry condition by directly
using the background solutions.

the nal form of the supersymmetry condition is now:

(l  ir) =

r5
1 + c
r5

08 + tanhvuut

 (l + ir), (79)

16

and its self-consistency can again be checked by observing that the matrix in the
rhs of (79) is idempotent.

the extension of this result to d < 9 is again straight-forward. the nal result
is a replacement of (9, 8) by ( d,  (d1)) respectively, for trivial unit vectors n(a)
and p(a)s pointing only along xd. at the same time, the power of r is modied in
this equation appropriately to rd4. on the other hand, when n(a) = p(a) represent a
general rotated unit-vector in (10d)-dimensional internal space, the supersymmetry
condition is also modied by replacing  d by n.
we end this section by implementing these changes for the case of ( = ) charged
macroscopic strings in d = 8, by dening unit vectors: n(2) = p(2) = (cos, sin).
then 1/2 supersymmetry condition is:

4 sl(2, z)-multiplets and network solutions

(4.1) (p, q) charged macroscopic string solutions

the sl(2, z) multiplets of charged macroscopic strings and their supersymmetry
properties can be written following [8, 9, 29]. the bosonic backgrounds for a general
charged macroscopic string solution is generated in precisely the same manner as
in [8] and can be written down using the ten-dimensional solutions that we introduced
for our lower dimensional charged macroscopic strings. first, the einstein metric,
dened in ten-dimensions:

ge

m n = e(10)/4gs

m n ,

for our (d = 9) examples of sections-2 and 3 take a form:

ge = e(10)/4(cid:18)g i7(cid:19) ,

(81)

(82)

with g and (10)s given for (i)  = 0 in eqns. (18,26) and (20), (ii)  =  in eqns.
(64), (66) and (iii)  =  in eqns. (76), (78) respectively. the einstein metric dened
by (82) is invariant under the sl(2, z) transformation. only modication in these
are in the source terms in the green function (16) to make it sl(2, z) invariant [8].
nonzero components of the antisymmetric tensor are given by 3  3 matrices:

1

0 )ijqjq

(b)(i) = (m1
with q = qi(m1
0 )ijqj. components (i = 1, 2) in the above equation correspond
to the ns-ns and r-r sector elds and (b) is a 3  3 matrix given in equations

2 (b)

(83)

17

(26), (65), (77) for cases (i), (ii) and (iii) listed above. the dilaton for the ten-
dimensional extension of our (p, q)-string ((p, q)  (q1, q2) denoted above) solution
is given by the same expression as in eqn.(20) of [8], with aq replaced by e(10)s
coming from equations (20), (66) and (78) in our three examples. we therefore have
the sl(2, z) covariant ten-dimesnional backgrounds for the ten-dimensional extension
of our d = 9 charged macroscopic string solution. these can be compactied once
again to d = 9. the compactication of type ii theories to lower dimensions has has
been discussed in many papers [3133] and we do not persue it here. the extension
of the results to d < 9 solutions is straightforward as well. we now go on to discuss
the supersymmetry properties of these generalized solutions.

(4.2) supersymmetry

the supersymmetry of a (p, q)-charged macrscopic d  9 string solutions can be
examined from the ten-dimensional point of view, with type iib killing equations
as obtained from the supersymmetry variations written in [27, 28]. it can be argued
that the supersymmetry conditions that we have written in previous sections will be
modied only by a phase factor for general (p, q)-strings. this becomes clear when
one writes down the most general variation for the dilatino [28], in presence of both
ns-ns and r-r backgrounds generated in section-(4.1).

for our purpose, we however follow a path presented in [29] for the case of four-
dimensional theories with sl(2, z)-duality symemtries. this argument has been
applied to the case of type iib sl(2, z)-duality as well [9] and uses the fact that
killing spinors transform under sl(2, z) by a phase. explicitly for,

a + b
c + d

 
one has:

(l  ir)  e

i

2 (c +d)(l  ir).

(84)

(85)

in fact, as pointed out in [29], the transformation property of the spinors given in
(85) holds for killing spinors in general, including when they are explicitly dependent
on coordinates, such as r in our case. we can now use the above tranformation to
generate the supersymmetry condition for a general (p, q)-string starting from that
for (1, 0) ones.

we write down these supersymmetry conditions, only at asymptotic innity, namely
in the limit r  . this will be sucient for our present purpose, following a line of
study of string networks concentrating on the asymptotic properties of spinors [9,10].
although it is of importance to obtain the full supergravity solutions for the net-
works and examine complete supersymmetry properties, but we do not address the
issue here.

18

we also note that the above procedure to generate the supersymmetry condition of
a (p, q)-string, from (1, 0) ones, applies in einstein frame whereas our supersymmetry
conditions of sections-2 and 3 are written in the string frame. the translation among
these frames involve redenitions of elds written explicitly in appendix of [28] and
involve only dilaton-dependent scaling factors, when one restricts to the analysis of
dilatino supersymmetry variation. however since the asymptotic values of the dilaton
in all our examples in previous sections turn out to be independent of the parameter
 with   0 as r  , identical supersymmetry conditions hold in einstein frame
as well. they have explicit forms for d = 9 examples as:

(86)

(i)  =  : (l  ir) = ei(p,q,0) [cosh08 + sinh98] (l + ir),
(ii)  =  : (l  ir) = ei(p,q,0)(cid:18) 1
(iii) = 0,  6= 0 : (lir) = ei(p,q,0)[08+tanh

08 + tanh90(cid:19) (l + ir), (87)
(9098)](l+ir), (88)
with  denoting the phase associated with the complex parameter p + q0 and the
subscript of  denotes its asymptotic value. the value of the phase is once again
given by the same expression, as for the neutral string, since the transformations that
generate them from the charged (1, 0)-string supersymmetry-condition is identical to
the one for the neutral ones in [9].

(4.3) network solutions

to obtain the network solutions, we now start with case (i) above and nd out
if arbitrary number of (p, q)-strings can be arranged in a manner preserving some
supersymmetry. for this we now generalize (86) further to accommodate arbitrary
orientation of strings in spatial directions.
in particular, for the string making an
angle  from x8 axis in an x8  x7 plane, the supersymmetry condition (86) modies
into:

(l  ir) = exp(i(p, q, 0)) [(cosh0 + sinh9)

(cos8 + sin7) ] (l + ir)

(89)

the network solution with 1/4 supersymmetry is then found from the above equa-
tion by identifying the internal and space-time orientations of the strings, namely
 = . moreover since the above condition is solved by spinors satisfying the follow-
ing conditions:

l = (cosh0  sinh9)8l,
r = (cosh0  sinh9)8r,

19

(90)

and

l = (cosh0  sinh9)7r,

(91)

which are independent of the the orientation , we have the possibility of network so-
lution by arranging arbitrarily large number of strings, provided charge conservations
hold on every 3-string junctions.

equations (90) and (91) are analogous to the supersymmetry conditions for the f
and d-strings respectively in our case. we like to point out that for this example, the
existence of a network solution is already gauranteed from its existence in the neutral
case. this is because of our earlier observation that ( = ) charged solution is
generated from neutral ones by a group of constant coordinate transformation. this
property continues to hold even for a (p, q)-charged macroscopic string solution, as the
group of constant coordinate transformations commutes with sl(2, z). above results
can be generalized to the lower dimensional cases by making appropriate replacements
already mentioned in section-(3.1)

the network solution and its interpretations are more interesting in case (ii),
namely for  = . first, as can be noticed from the supersymmetry condition,
eqn.(87), a solution like case (i) in d = 9 does not exist. this is because, only the
rst term in the bracket in the rhs of eqn. (87) can be modied, as in eqn.(89),
to include an orientation-depence of the string through angle . the second term in
the bracket, dependent on 90, namely the ones representing the internal and time
coordinates, remains unchaged under any spatial rotation of string in x8  x7 plane.
as a result, solutions like the ones in eqns. (90, 91) do not work.
to obtain a network solution in this case, with a unique spinor satisfying the
(p, q) string supersymmetry condition for their arbitrary orientations, one needs to
go down to d  8. this is done by introducing a parameter associated with rotation
in internal space, in addition to the angle  that the string now makes with x7 axis in
x7  x6 spatial plane. the eight-dimensional supersymmetry conditions, employing
internal rotations, was already given in eqn.(80). a modication of this, for nonzero
 is given as:

(l  ir)

= eih

1

cosh(cos07 + sin06)

+tanh(cos90 + sin80) ] (l + ir).

to obtain -independent spinor-projections we now identify

 =  = .

(92)

(93)

this identication allows one to solve eqn. (93) for s which are -independent and
satisfy projection conditions:

 (
(

07 + tanh90)l = l,

07 + tanh90)r = r,

20

(94)

and

1

cosh

 (

06 + tanh80)l = r.

(95)

the conditions (94) and (95) are again the analogs of the f-string and d-string
supersymmetry conditions for the charged macroscopic (d = 8) strings considered
here. the identications (93) imply a coupling between the u(1) phase coming from
s-dualtiy transformation to the one coming from the solution generating transfor-
mations. physically this can be interpreted as implying a relationship between the
gauge-charges with (p, q)-charges coming from 2-form elds. it will be interesting to
analyze the precise implications of this relationship on the physical properties of the
networks.

finally we comment on the case (i) and other charged macroscopic string solutions.
it is now evident that the condition (88) is of a form which does not lead to an obvious
solution for an orientation independent projection condition. this can be related
technically to the fact that in this case one has all three combination of  matrices
(in d = 9) appearing in eqn.(88), unlike in conditions (i) and (ii) where only two of
the three combinations appeared, allowing above solutions. this is the property of
other  6= 0,  6= 0 solutions as well and may be related to the fact that a general
left-right asymmetric solution generating transformation acts dierently on l and r
and is inconsistent with the conditions of having a network solution, as they require
relationships like (91) and (95) between them.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have obtained supersymmetry properties of the charged macrscopic
strings. we have also shown the existence of a network solution of charged strings.
some of these are completely inquivalent with respect to the network of neutral string
solutions.

in the context of network construction, it should be pointed out that our exer-
cise only shows the presence of a unique killing spinor at asymptotic innity in the
presence of large number of (p, q) strings. we do not present the spinor at arbitrary
space-time point. this however requires the knowledge of string network solutions
for the full supergravity which is not completely understood even for neutral strings,
although progress in this direction has been reported [22]. more precisely, we notice
that the killing spinor has a coordinate-dependence given by a covariant expression
for the green functions, leading to dierent spatial dependence for every (p, q)-string.
it is hoped that the full killing spinor of a supergravity solution for these networks
will be given by a smooth funtion which will properly match on to every string in a
network.

it will also be interesting to generalize these to non-planar networks and possibly
to nd the applications of such networks to four-dimensional gauge theories [20, 21].

21

moreover, one can possibly also analyze the possibility of network solutions when
strings are compactied on other manifolds like k3 etc. and be able to obtain a
realization of various bps states in string theories in this manner.
