abstract

a relation between the total instanton number and the quantum-numbers
of magnetic monopoles that arise in general abelian gauges in su(2) yang-
mills theory is established. the instanton number is expressed as the sum of
the twists of all monopoles, where the twist is related to a generalized hopf
invariant. the origin of a stronger relation between instantons and monopoles
in the polyakov gauge is discussed.

1 introduction

instantons and (abelian projection) monopoles are both topological objects that
are associated with low-energy phenomena in qcd. while instantons provide a
solution to the u(1) problem [1, 2] and an explanation for chiral symmetry breaking
[3], they have not been able to explain color connement yet [4, 5]. a possible
mechanism for the latter is the dual meissner eect due to condensation of magnetic
monopoles that arise in so-called abelian gauges [6, 7]. lattice simulations indicate
that magnetic monopoles indeed play an important role for connement [8, 9, 10, 11].
since lattice simulations also indicate that the transition to a deconned phase and
the restoration of chiral symmetry occur at approximately the same temperature, it
would be puzzling if they were generated by completely independent mechanisms.
there is indeed evidence from both analytical studies and lattice simulations that
instantons and monopoles are locally correlated in several abelian gauges [12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17]. a strict relation between the total instanton number (pontryagin
index) and the quantum numbers of magnetic monopoles has, however, only been
established in the polyakov gauge (or the related modied axial gauge) up to now
[18, 19, 20]. in this work, such a relation is derived for general abelian gauges.

section 2 presents a short review of the denition of general abelian gauges
in terms of an auxiliary higgs eld and of the characterization of the magnetic
monopole singularities arising in these gauges. in sec. 3, the general relation between

the instanton number and the auxiliary higgs eld is established for the euclidean
space-time s4. section 4 provides a generalization of the hopf invariant of maps
from s3 to s2 to maps from s2  s1 to s2. this invariant is used in sec. 5 to
derive the contribution of a single monopole loop to the instanton number. the
resulting relation between the instanton number and the generalized hopf invariants
of monopoles is illustrated with the example of a single-instanton solution that is
known to lead to a monopole loop in the (dierential) maximal abelian gauge [13]. in
sec. 6, the contribution of topologically non-trivial monopole loops to the instanton
number on the space-time s3s1 is derived. section 7 gives a qualitative explanation
for the existence of a stronger relation between instantons and monopoles in the
polyakov gauge. the nal section contains a discussion of the results.

2 monopoles in general abelian gauges

throughout this work, we consider pure su(2) yang-mills theory. the term abelian
gauge will be used for gauges that are dened by the diagonalization of some eld
[a] that transforms according to the adjoint representation of the gauge group,

(x)  (x)(x)+(x)

(1)

under a gauge transformation (x)  su(2). due to this property, we will call
 an auxiliary higgs eld. it is not a fundamental eld of the theory but rather
a functional of the gauge potential a. the eld  can take values in either the
gauge group (in our case su(2)) or its algebra (su(2)). well-known examples are
the polyakov gauge, where  is the (time-dependent) polyakov line,

(x, t) = p exp(cid:18)z t+

t

dt a0(x, t)(cid:19)  su(2)

(2)

and the maximal abelian gauge where  =     su(2) minimizes the functional

under the constraint || = 1.

r[, a] =z d4x tr(cid:0)[ + a, ]2(cid:1)

(3)

monopole singularities arise where  does not dene a direction in color space,
i.e., where  = 0 for   su(2) or  = 1 for   su(2). since these conditions
involve three equations, the monopole singularities will generically occupy points
in three-dimensional space or one-dimensional submanifolds (world-lines) in four-
dimensional space-time. around these points, the direction of the auxiliary higgs
eld denes a map from a two-dimensional sphere s2 to another s2. (in space-time,
one has to consider two-spheres that link with the monopole world-line.) the wind-
ing number of this map provides the charge of the magnetic monopole singularity
that appears in the diagonal part of the gauge potential after gauge xing. it can
be expressed as

m = deg[ ] =

1

8zs 2

ijk i d j  d k =

i

16zs 2

tr  d   d  ,

(4)

2

where the unit vector  in the direction of the higgs eld is dened via the relations

 =    and

 =


||

for   su(2) ,

 = cos  + i    sin 

for   su(2) ,

and  =    denotes the corresponding su(2) matrix.

using the fact that the gauge xing transformation  diagonalizes ,

m can be expressed in terms of ,

 + = 3 ,

m =

i

4zs 2

tr 3(d +)2 .

(5)

(6)

(7)

since the integrand is a total dierential, (d +)2 = d(d +),  has to be dis-
continuous at some point x1 on s2 if m 6= 0. this is the origin of the dirac string
singularity in the abelian projected gauge potential. since the higgs eld is contin-
uous on s2, the discontinuity in  has to be abelian,

(x)  ei(x)30

for x  x1 .

(8)

the magnetic charge can be expressed as the winding number of the phase  along
an innitesimal closed curve c around x1 on s2,

m =

1

2 zc

d .

(9)

note that although the above discussion does not directly apply to the maximal
abelian gauge since the constraint || = 1 does not permit zeros of , discontinuities
of  cannot in general be avoided also in this gauge and monopole singularities arise
after gauge xing.
in this case, of course, also the auxiliary higgs eld itself is
discontinuous.

3 instantons in general abelian gauges

the above discussion shows that all information about the positions and charges
of the monopoles is present in the auxiliary higgs eld that denes the abelian
gauge in question. one is prompted to ask whether information about the number
of instantons is also included. since the latter relates to global properties of the
gauge eld it is useful to consider a specic space-time geometry. for simplicity, we
choose s4. it can be covered by two charts. we will use one large chart that covers
all of s4 with the exception of one point and as a second chart a small neighborhood
of that point. the excluded point can be chosen such that the direction of the higgs

3

eld is well-dened on the small chart. in the overlap, the gauge elds on the two
charts are related by a gauge transformation with a transition function u  su(2),

a(1) = u +(a(2) + d)u .

(10)

since the higgs eld transforms according to the adjoint representation of the gauge
group (it belongs to an associated ber bundle), the higgs elds on the two charts
are related by the same gauge transformation,

(1) = u +(2)u .

(11)

we use stereographic projection to parameterize the large chart by r4. equa-
tion (10) then turns into the statement that a(1) approaches a pure gauge at innity,

a(1)(x)  u +(x) du(x)

for

|x|   .

(12)

we drop the superscript (1) in the following because we do not need the second chart
any more. the winding number (or degree) of u as a map from s3 to su(2) = s3
is the total instanton number  of a,

 = deg[u] 

1

242zs 3

tr(cid:2)(u +du)3(cid:3)

(13)

the higgs eld approaches the corresponding gauge transform of a constant (the
value of the higgs eld on the excluded point of s4),

(x)  (x)  u +(x) 0 u(x)

for

|x|   .

(14)

due to our choice of charts, the direction of  is well-dened. it provides a map
from s3 to s2. such maps fall into dierent homotopy classes and can be charac-
terized by the so-called hopf invariant (see e.g. [21]). it is usually dened in an
indirect way: let 2 denote the volume form on s2 (strictly speaking, the pull-back
of it),

2 = 1

2ijk i d j  d k =  i

4 tr  d   d  .

(15)

since the second homology group of s3 is trivial, h2(s3) = 0 (s3 does not contain
non-contractible two-spheres), 2 is closed and can be written as a total derivative,
2 = d, where  is a one-form. the hopf invariant is dened as

[ ] 

1

162zs 3

  d

(16)

and is independent of the choice of . geometrically, the hopf invariant is given by
the linking number of the preimages of two arbitrary points on s2. the preimages
are generically one-dimensional curves and have an orientation induced from the
neighborhood of the two points. the linking number is dened as the number of

4

times one has to cross the two preimages to disentangle them with orientations taken
properly into account. it has the algebraic representation

l =

1

4 z x  x

|x  x|3  (dl  dl)

(17)

where the line integrals are performed over the two preimages. one can show that
l is independent of the choice of the two points on s2.

the representation (14) can be used to express 2 in terms of u,

2 = i tr[ 0(duu +)2] ,

which can be easily integrated,

2 = d with  = i tr[ 0 duu +] .

without loss of generality we may choose 0 = 3 yielding

  d =  tr[3 duu +]  tr[3 duu +  duu +]

tr(cid:2)(duu +)3(cid:3) ,

where the anti-commutativity of the wedge product has been exploited. we nd
that the hopf invariant is given by the negative of the degree of u,

[ ] =  deg[u] =  .

(21)

the instanton number is therefore identical to the negative of the hopf invariant of
the auxiliary higgs eld at innity.

how does the latter relate to monopoles? the necessity of points where  is
undened for non-vanishing instanton number follows immediately: a non-trivial
 : s3  s2 cannot be deformed into a constant continuously and is therefore
not extendable to r4. the question whether these points are monopoles (i.e., have
non-zero magnetic charge) and how their charges relate to the instanton number
requires a more detailed analysis.

before this, we investigate how the instanton number decomposes into contri-
butions from the individual monopoles. consider the generic case of an arbitrary
number of closed monopole loops in s4. since loops cannot link in four dimensions,
it is possible to enclose the individual loops in disjoint four-volumes vi that are topo-
logically trivial (have no holes). the hopf invariant has the nice property of being
additive in the sense that [ ] can be written as the sum of the hopf invariants of
 on the boundaries of the volumes vi,

 = [ ] =xi

(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)vi(cid:3) ,

5

(22)

since  is continuous outside of the vi. furthermore, since (the adjoint of) the gauge
xing transformation  that diagonalizes  is related to  in the same way as u to
,

the individual contributions are identical to the respective degrees of ,

 = +3  ,

(23)

(24)

(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)vi(cid:3) = (cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)vi(cid:3) ,

the right hand side is non-zero only if  is singular in vi, in which case the degree
equals the instanton number of the gauge singularities produced by  inside of vi.
we have reduced the problem to the calculation of the hopf invariant of a single
monopole loop in a topologically trivial volume v .

4 generalized hopf invariant

in the modied axial gauge, it is possible to express the instanton number in terms of
monopole charges that can be calculated from properties of the auxiliary higgs eld
in the vicinity of the monopole world-lines [20]. it would be desirable to establish
a similar relation in the general case. accordingly, we embed each monopole loop
into a loop of nite thickness and try to assign a hopf invariant to  on the surface
t of the thick loop. this surface is a higher-dimensional generalization of a tube
and has the topology of s2  s1. the coordinate corresponding to the second
factor can be interpreted as the proper time   [0, 2] (in euclidean space) of the
monopole, the rst factor as a sphere surrounding the monopole at xed  . in quest
of an invariant of |t , we seek a characterization of the homotopy classes of maps
 : s2s1  s2. these have been studied in ref. [22]. following the ideas developed
there, we give a more explicit discussion that is better suited for our purposes. a
rst characterization is given by the magnetic charge we have introduced in the
previous section. it is the winding number of  in its rst argument for xed  . by
continuity, it has to be independent of  . however, on a compact manifold the total
magnetic charge vanishes.
it is therefore not a good candidate for the instanton
number.

the most obvious ansatz for a further invariant, a naive generalization of the
hopf invariant (16), is only possible for m = 0: the magnetic charge is given by the
integral of the pull-back 2 of the volume form on s2 for xed  . for m 6= 0, it is
therefore not possible to write 2 as a total dierential. in this case, it is actually
not possible to dene an integer valued invariant at all, since it turns out that the
homotopy classes of maps s2  s1  s2 with a given magnetic charge m form the
group z2|m| rather than z (as can be inferred from the results of [22]).

however, it is possible to generalize the hopf invariant to a restricted class of
functions s2  s1  s2 with magnetic charge m 6= 0. it is this invariant that will
enable us to establish a relation between instantons and monopoles in sec. 5. we
consider maps  : s2  s1  s2 that map a xed point on s2 to another xed point

6

0 on the target s2 for every value of the second argument. for deniteness, we
choose the rst point to be the south pole. in polar coordinates (, ) on s2, the
restriction therefore reads

(=, ,  ) = 0

(25)

with 0  su(2) and |0| = 1. (recall that the target s2 has been introduced as the
unit sphere in su(2).) motivated by the relation (21) between the hopf invariant and
the degree of a diagonalizing gauge transformation for maps s3  s2, we diagonalize
,

 = +3  ,

(26)

with  continuous on (s2 \ { = })  s1. for non-zero magnetic charge m, 
cannot be chosen continuous on all of s2  s1. at the south pole, it has an abelian
discontinuity,

(, ,  )  ei(, )3 0

for    ,

(27)

related to the ambiguity of multiplying  with a diagonal matrix from the left in
eq. (26). 0 is a constant matrix that diagonalizes 0, i.e., 0 = +

0 30.
unfortunately, the analog of the degree for maps from s2  s1 to s2,

[]

(28)

depends on the choice of the diagonalization matrix . under a change   
with  = ei(,, )3,  is not invariant, because it is not additive for discontinuous

(29)

the winding number of the diagonal function  vanishes, but the surface term gives
a contribution (on the boundary  =   , the coordinate system (,  ) is right-

(30)

(31)

the other winding numbers are dened analogously. they do not depend on the
values 0 respectively 0. the winding number of  for xed  vanishes since  is
continuous for all  <  including the north pole. hence,

[] = [] + n =0[]n=

=0[] .

(32)

in the case at hand, the winding number of  for xed  is just the magnetic charge,
n =0[] = m (cf. eq. (9)). since the discontinuous phase (,  ) in eq. (27) changes
by (, ,  ), it is therefore possible to dene an invariant as

[ ]  []  mn=0[] .

(33)

we will refer to this invariant as the generalized hopf invariant on s2 s1. it consti-
tutes the desired topological invariant for maps s2  s1  s2 with magnetic charge
m that fulll eq. (25). it turns out that (33) is the only invariant and the homotopy
classes of such maps form the group z [22]. the restriction (25) has increased the
number of homotopy classes since it restricts the set of possible deformations. if
deformations that violate eq. (25) are allowed, maps with  diering by multiples
of 2m can be deformed into each other. a mathematically more appealing denition
of  is given in ref. [22]. it coincides with the more explicit denition given here.

note that the generalized hopf invariant depends on the choice of the coordinate
, as indicated by the subscript on : consider, for instance, the coordinate system
(, ,  ) with  =  + k and integer k that is an admissible parameterization
of s2  s1, too. under this change of coordinates, [] is not altered, since the
volume element occurring in the integral (28) is invariant. the winding number
(31), however, changes,

n =0[] =

1

2z 2

0

d

d(0  k,  )

d

= n=0[]  kn =0[] ,

(34)

because the path { = 0k,   [0, 2]} along which the change of  is calculated,
is equivalent to the sum of the original path { = 0,   [0, 2]} and a path that
winds k times around the negative -direction for xed  . the generalized hopf
invariant therefore changes by m2k,

 [ ] = [ ] + m2k .

(35)

furthermore, [ ] depends on the point on the factor s2 of the domain (here
the south pole) that is used to formulate the constraint (25). one can show that a
dierent choice changes [ ] by 2m deg[ |] with  =   s1 where  is a curve
between the old and the new point. to apply the above denition, one has to change
the coordinate system such that the new point corresponds to  = , of course.

geometrically, the generalized hopf invariant is, as the original hopf invariant,
given by the linking number of the preimages of two points on the target s2 if we
represent s2  s1 as a lled torus b2  s1 in three-space with the boundary of the
disk b2 identied to one point  the xed point that is mapped to 0 in eq. (25)

8

(cf. fig. 1). the ambiguity arising from dierent coordinates  is now replaced by
the ambiguity of dierent embeddings in three-space. in order to obtain the same
denition as eq. (33), curves with constant  on the surface of the lled torus must
not wind around the torus, i.e., be topologically trivial in the complement of the
torus. this xes a possible twist of the torus. since, for a charge m conguration,
each point has m preimages and a twist links every preimage with every other, it is
obvious that it changes the generalized hopf invariant by m2. the example below
will show that the generalized hopf invariant measures the twist of the higgs eld.
in view of the relation between internal and real space present in a eld with non-
zero winding number m, it is not surprising that [ ] is also sensitive to a twist in
real space.

torus in three-space. the picture shows an example with magnetic charge 1 (one
preimage per point) and generalized hopf invariant 1 (the preimages are linked
once).

(40)

the factor +( ) is needed to make  periodic also for odd k. as argued above,
the non-abelian winding number of  is the same as that of 1, because a shift of
 by a multiple of  does not change it. since 1 depends on only two parameters,
it vanishes, [] = 0. for   , one nds

(41)

(42)

we conclude that the generalized hopf invariant is given by the product of the mag-
netic charge and the number of times the higgs eld is twisted along the monopole
loop. obviously, the same is true for twists of arbitrary congurations (, , 0).
for unit charge monopoles, this gives all possible values of [ ]. for higher charges,
there are additional cases 0 < || < |m| that cannot be represented in the simple
form (37). they correspond to elds that are twisted only on a part of s2 that
carries one unit (or m < m units) of magnetic charge.

5 hopf invariant of a monopole loop

we consider a single closed monopole loop m where the higgs eld vanishes (or is
in the center for a group valued eld). following the strategy developed in sec. 3,
we will embed the monopole loop into a topologically trivial four-volume v . by eq.
(22), the contribution of the monopole loop to the instanton number is then given
by the hopf invariant of  on the surface of v .

10

as in the previous section, we rst embed the monopole loop m into a loop of

nite thickness r,

vm (cid:8)x  r4 (cid:12)(cid:12) |x  y|  r for some y  m(cid:9) .

r should be so small that vm does not become topologically non-trivial by self-
intersections. since we intend to apply the denition of the generalized hopf invari-
ant given above, we choose an isocurve c of  on the surface t of vm,

(43)

a note on the existence of such a curve: on every section a = s2 through t and for

and c  t  vm .

(44)

(cid:12)(cid:12)c = 0

every 0  (0, ) there exists a curve  on which  = (0, ) andr d 6= 0. let a

denote that connected component of a\  where the south pole is taken. on moving
a along s1 through t , a changes continuously and cannot disappear because of
the non-vanishing integral. the union of all a gives an open tube t 
0  t . on
changing 0, , and therefore also t 
0, can be chosen to change continuously. on
the intersection t 
0 along a
s2 in t is simply connected, this is also true for sections of t 
 must
contain a curve c of the required properties.

0, we have  = s. since each section of t 

  t0 t 

 . therefore, t 

now, we close the loop with a two-dimensional sheet d (reminiscent of a dirac

sheet) that has c as its boundary,

d = c ,

(45)

and intersects vm only there. for r  0, the condition (44) can be represented in
terms of d: it requires that d emerges from m in a direction where  = 0. we
complement vm by a sheet of nite thickness  < r around d,

vd (cid:8)x  r4 (cid:12)(cid:12) |x  y|   for some y  d(cid:9) = b2  b2 ,

to dene the topologically trivial volume v ,

v = vm  vd .

(46)

(47)

eventually, we will perform the limit   0. we decompose the surface of v into
parts around the loop and the sheet,

v = t  td ,

t  t \ vd

= b2  s1 ,

td  vd \ vm

= s1  b2 .

(48)

(49)

(50)

the various manifolds are sketched in fig. 3 for the example of a loop in the z-t-
plane, x = y = 0, z2 + t2 = r2, using double polar coordinates in space-time,

the tube t can be parameterized by the coordinates  = arctan(u/(v  r)),  and
 that have the same orientation as in sec. 4. a double set of polar coordinates
(u, , v,  ) with u = 0 on d and v = v0 = const on c can be chosen for any m and
d and will be used in the following.

the intersection

t  t  td = t = td

(52)

is parameterized by the coordinates  and  .

since there is no local representation of the hopf invariant, we can not calculate
separate contributions from t and td to [ |v ]. therefore, we diagonalize  on
v = s3,

 = +3 on v ,

(53)

and calculate the contributions to [], which is by eq. (24) equal to the negative
of the desired hopf invariant.

in the limit   0, the intersection t reduces to the curve c. condition (44)

implies that, in this limit,  is constant up to a diagonal factor,

  ei(, )30

for

  0 .

(54)

12

as in sec. 4, the winding number of  for xed  gives the magnetic charge of the
monopole singularity,

n =0[] = m .

(55)

the interpretation of the winding number for xed  can be found by noting that
td approaches the sheet d in the limit   0, and therefore

  ei(,v, )3 (v,  ) on td

for

  0 ,

where  is independent of  and diagonalizes  on d,

 = +3  on d .

on the boundary d = c, also  is constant up to a diagonal factor,

 = ei ( )30

on c .

(56)

(57)

(58)

by the same way as the winding number of  is related to the magnetic charge, that
of  is related to the degree of  on d (cf. eqs. (4) and (9)),

n[ ] = deg(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)d(cid:3) .

this degree is well-dened since the boundary c of d is mapped to a single point. d
is therefore eectively compactied to s2. it can be interpreted as the ux through
d produced by the gauge xing transformation. however, since the ux stems from
a nite magnetic eld, unlike the ux of the monopole singularity, it cannot be
distinguished from the ux already present before gauge xing.

furthermore, since the two expressions (54) and (56) for  on t = td for   0
have to coincide, the relation (,  ) = ( )  (, v0,  ) follows (v = v0 on c).  is
continuous also for v  0. therefore, its winding number with respect to  vanishes
and the corresponding winding numbers of  and  are identical, whence

the winding number with respect to  is the negative of that of ,

n=0[] = deg(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)d(cid:3) .

n =0[] = m .

(60)

(61)

we can now express the contributions to [|v ] in the limit   0 in terms of
. for t, we insert the winding number of  into the denition of the generalized
hopf invariant, eq. (33), to obtain

(59)

(62)

d(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3) =  lim

0

(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3)  m deg(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)d(cid:3) .

we have replaced the subscript  on  by d, because d determines the coordinate
 up to homotopy:  is that angle on the torus t that can be continuously extended

13

to the whole tube td around d. obviously, this is not the case for  ruling out an
admixture of  to .

for the second contribution, we note that, since td

= s1  b2 has the same
topology as t, we can apply the relation (32) for the non-abelian winding number
of a product to eq. (56). the angles  and  have exchanged their roles:

lim
0

(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)td(cid:3) = [ ] + n=0[ ]nv=v0

 =0[] =  deg(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)d(cid:3) m ,

where we have used the fact that [ ] vanishes since  depends on only two param-
eters and have inserted the winding numbers (59) and (61). putting eqs. (62) and
(63) together, we obtain

(63)

(64)

(65)

the hopf invariant of  on v is therefore given by

lim
0

(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)v(cid:3) = lim

0(cid:16)(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)td(cid:3)(cid:17) = d(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3)  2m deg(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)d(cid:3) .
(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)v(cid:3) = d(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3) + 2m deg(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)d(cid:3) .

this is the desired expression for the contribution of a monopole loop to the instan-
ton number (cf. eq. (22)). while d[ |t ] depends on the position of the sheet d, it
is independent of the values of  on d, as indicated. the latter enter through the
term deg[ |d], though. the instanton number is therefore not given by properties of
the auxiliary higgs eld near the monopole singularity only. the instanton number
modulo 2m, however, is:

(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)v(cid:3) = d(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3)

(mod 2m) .

(66)

one can show that also the dependence on the position of d disappears here, since
a dierent choice of d changes d[ |t ] only by multiples of 2m: we have already
seen in sec. 4 that a change of the curve c used for the condition (44) generates
such a shift. there, however, a change of the coordinate  produced a shift by m2.
here, only a shift by 2m2 is possible. the reason is that the embedding of s2  s1
into r4 given by t xes the coordinate  up to multiples of 2 (up to homotopy).
figure 4, for instance, shows an alternative choice of the sheet d for the loop of
fig. 3. consider rst a sheet that stays at the position indicated in the rst picture
for all  . a curve of constant  corresponds to a  -independent point on the circle
where the tube meets the sphere. now consider a sheet that winds once around the
sphere while  changes by 2 as indicated in the other pictures. since  has to be
continuous on td, a curve of constant  has to be homotopically equivalent to a
 -independent point in the v = 0-plane. this is indicated by the thick lines on the
tubes for a point on the positive x-axis. on the intersection of tube and sphere, the
curve of constant  now winds twice around the circle as  changes by 2. this
sheet therefore corresponds to a new coordinate  =  + 2 . obviously a shift by
only  is not possible.

(68)

and write

since the group of homotopy classes of maps from s2  s1 to s2 with magnetic
winding number m is z2|m| (cf. sec. 4), this is the maximal information that can be
expected.

one could argue that it is possible to get rid of the additional term in eq. (65) by
choosing a sheet d on which  is constant, |d = 0. however, this is not possible
in general. if the hopf invariant [ |v ] is non-zero,  takes all possible values on
v . this implies that the preimages of all points extend to the exterior of v (and
some even to innity if the total instanton number is non-zero). one therefore has
to expect that also an isosurface d whose boundary is a monopole loop leaves v .
such a d cannot be used to identify the contribution of an individual monopole
loop to the instanton number in the way described here.

the result (65) can also be understood geometrically: the decomposition v =
t  td corresponds topologically to the decomposition of s3 into two lled tori,
s3 = b2  s1  s1  b2 (cf. fig. 5). the hopf invariant of  on v is given by
the linking number of the preimages of two points. each point has m = deg[ |t ]
preimages in the lled torus corresponding to t and deg[ |d] preimages in the one
corresponding to td if the orientation of the preimages is taken into account. if
we furthermore choose the decomposition into the two tori compatible with the
coordinate  around c in the same way as the embedding of the torus into r3 in
sec. 4, the linking number of the preimages in t is given by d[ |t ]. the preimages
in td do not link since  becomes -independent in the limit   0. finally, we
have to take into account the linking between the preimages in t and td. this
gives the remaining term 2m deg[ |d] in eq. (65).

monopole loop for instanton solution. the authors of [13] have found solu-
tions to the dierential maximal abelian gauge condition for the single instanton
solution [23, 24] that correspond to closed monopole loops of various radii. although
the global minimum of the gauge xing functional (3) is only reached in the limit of
zero radius, it is conjectured that a small perturbation from, e.g., a nearby instanton
can stabilize a nite radius. to check our result,2 we calculate the contributions to
eq. (65) for the explicit solution that has been given in [13] for the limit in which
the radius of the monopole loop is much smaller than the radius of the instanton.
in the double polar coordinates of eq. (51) in space-time and in spherical polar
coordinates in target space, the solution for a regular gauge instanton reads

sin  cos( +  )
sin  sin( +  )

cos

where  is a function of u and v only,

(u, v) = + +  where

(69)

(70)

the angles  can be chosen continuous modulo 2 everywhere with the exception
of the circle u = 0, v = r, where the monopole singularity arises (cf. fig. 6 copied
since  tends to 0 or 
from [13]). a contour plot of (u, v) is shown in fig. 7.

2in the case of the maximal abelian gauge, it is also valid for the space-time r4, because the

niteness of the gauge xing functional 3 guarantees the validity of eq. 14.

for u  0 or v  0, there are no additional singularities due to the angles  and
 . for u2 + v2  ,  tends to the standard hopf map [25] with  substituted
by  and therefore carries a hopf invariant of 1. a gauge transformation that
diagonalizes  removes the instanton winding number from the gauge potential at
innity and produces a gauge singularity along the monopole loop (and on a sheet
d) that carries the same winding number.

in order to calculate the contributions to eq. (65), we note that near the mono-
pole +  0 and  complements  to a set of spherical polar coordinates on the
sphere around the monopole. finally,  measures the position along the monopole
loop. a natural choice for the sheet d is u = 0, v  r as in fig. 3 where  = 
and  = 3. the condition (44) is therefore fullled for every tube around the
monopole loop. furthermore, the coordinate  is compatible with the sheet d since
it can be dened globally on a tube u = , v  r around the sheet d. since   
near the monopole loop,  is identical to the eld (36) from the example in sec. 4

17

for m = k = 1 and the rst term in eq. (65) is therefore

on the sheet d,  is constant. the corresponding degree therefore vanishes,

d(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3) = 1 .
deg(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)d(cid:3) = 0 ,

(71)

(72)

(73)

(74)

(75)

and the second term in (65) does not contribute. we obtain the expected result
 = 1. note that this is a non-generic case where the argument of the paragraph
after eq. (68) is circumvented in a special way: while indeed the preimages of all
points extend to innity, that of  =  splits at the origin into the plane v = 0 and
the sheet d due to a vanishing jacobi matrix of .

to see how the contributions to the instanton number depend on the sheet d
chosen, we repeat the calculation for an alternative sheet d indicated schematically
in fig. 7. the indicated relation between u and v is complemented by the condition
 = 0. the angle  is not constrained. by using the right-handed set of coordinates
( =   ,  = ,  ) and the formulae in sec. 4, one nds that in this case

the higgs eld on the sheet d is not constant any more but takes all values on s2
as can be seen in fig. 7,

d(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3) = +1 .

(cid:12)(cid:12)d =


sin(  ) cos(0 +  )
sin(  ) sin(0 +  )

 ,

where  is a suitable radial coordinate with range [0, ] on d. due to the occurrence
of   , this map has degree

deg(cid:2)(cid:12)(cid:12)d(cid:3) = 1 .

the magnetic charge is still +1 because we have not changed the orientation of
 . the hopf invariant on the surface v  around t and d is therefore again
[|v ] = 1  2 = 1. the contributions from the generalized hopf invariant and
the higgs eld on the sheet d, however, have changed.

by twisting the sheet d, i.e., replacing the condition  = 0 by  = 0 + n ,
d[|t ] = 2n+1 and the appropriate value deg[|d] =

one can obtain any odd value 
n  1 that yield a total [|v ] = 1.

6 topologically non-trivial monopole loops

the procedure of closing the individual loops by sheets cannot be applied to loops
that are topologically non-trivial in space-time. the simplest geometry where this
can occur is s3  s1. topologically non-trivial loops wind around the second factor.
for simplicity, we assume all elds to be periodic in the second factor. this can

18

always be accomplished by a gauge transformation. we map s3 by stereographic
projection to r3 such that that there is no monopole at the point that is mapped
to innity. in this case, the elds tend to a pure gauge at innity,

a(x)  u +(x, t) du(x, t)
(x)  u +(x, t) 0 u(x, t)  (x, t)

for

|x|   ,

(76)

and the instanton number is given by the winding number of the map u : s2  s1 
su(2) which can be expressed as an integral over the same density as for maps
s3  su(2),

 = [u] 

1

242zs 2s 1

tr(cid:2)(u +du)3(cid:3) .

(77)

since the total magnetic charge on the compact manifold s3 necessarily vanishes,
 : s2  s1  s2 has magnetic winding number zero. as already mentioned in
sec. 4, the set of homotopy classes of such maps is z and is parameterized by a hopf
invariant dened in an analogous way as for maps s3  s2. consequently, also the
relation between the winding number of u and the hopf invariant of  remains
the same,

[u] = [ ] .

(78)

however, the procedure advocated in sec. 3 is not directly applicable here be-
cause it is not possible to embed topologically non-trivial monopole loops into topo-
logically trivial volumes. if we embed a single topologically non-trivial loop into a
topologically non-trivial volume v , the auxiliary higgs eld has a non-zero mag-
netic winding number on v . it is therefore not possible to assign a unique hopf
invariant to it. the best we can do in order to decompose the hopf invariant, is to
group the monopole loops into neutral sets and embed each set into a volume that
is topologically as simple as possible, i.e., equivalent to b3  s1. if this is done,
the hopf invariant of  again splits into contributions from the boundaries of the
volumes vi,

where topologically trivial loops are treated as before.

to complete the calculation of the instanton number, we only have to consider a
single set of n topologically non-trivial monopole loops mi with magnetic charges
mi and total charge zero,

n

mi = 0 .

in order to construct the volume v = b3  s1 around these, we rst embed the

(98)

they can be interpreted as the abelian magnetic ux carried along the string from

furthermore,

n=0[

in the limit   0, we can now relate the non-abelian winding numbers of  on
ti and t 
 to the abelian winding numbers and generalized hopf invariants. for
ti, we have to express the generalized hopf invariant in terms of a diagonalizing
function  that is now discontinuous along two curves. considerations very similar

by eq. (78), [|v ] is equal to the hopf invariant of |v . inserting the expres-
sions (98) for n =0[

for the contribution to eq. (79),

(105)

therefore, eq. (103) contains information about  only and is independent of the
choice of . note, that although the generalized hopf invariants of  on the tubes
around the individual monopole loops depend on the choice of the coordinate ,
their sum is determined by the sheets d that relate  on the various tubes (cf.
fig. 8). as in the case of topologically trivial monopole loops, the instanton number
modulo 2m, where m is the largest common divisor of the mi, is determined by the
auxiliary higgs eld on the tubes ti around the monopoles only, and is independent
of the sheets d chosen.

7 polyakov gauge

we consider the polyakov gauge (or the related modied axial gauge) on the space-
time s3  s1 with periodic boundary conditions in time. in this setup, a stronger
relation between the instanton number and monopoles holds [20, 18, 19],

 =  xi

(xi)=1

mi ,

(106)

where the sum is taken over all monopole singularities where the polyakov line is
1.
in contrast to the general case, the position of the dirac strings does not
enter and every monopole contributes only mi (or 0) to the instanton number.
two monopoles with charges 1 and polyakov line 1, for instance, give  = 1
depending on the combination of signs. our above result, on the other hand, suggests
that each of the two monopoles can have an arbitrary twist, and therefore every
integral value of the instanton number should be possible. the polyakov line must
determine the relative twist of the monopoles in some way. in this section, we try
to shed some light onto this connection.

a special property of the polyakov gauge is that the polyakov line (cf. eq.
(2)) at a single time, e.g. t = 0, already contains some information on its time
dependence: first, the eigenvalues of the polyakov line are time-independent, since
its time evolution is given by

(x, t) = u +(x, t) (x, 0) u(x, t) ,

(107)

where u(x, t)  su(2) is the parallel transporter from (x, 0) to (x, t) along a straight
line. this relation implies that the monopoles are static. second, the temporal
boundary conditions of u are given in terms of (x, 0),

u(x, 0) = 1 ,
u(x, ) = (x, 0) ,

23

(108)

where we have chosen the temporal extension of space-time to be . the boundary
conditions on u, of course, restrict the possible time dependence of . it turns out
that this restriction determines the instanton number.

as before, the charts on s3 (or the stereographic projection) are chosen such

that there is no monopole at spatial innity,

(x, 0)  (x) 6= 1 for

|x|   .

(109)

since the transition function at |x|   and t = 0 maps s2 to su(2) and is
therefore homotopically trivial, (x) can always be made constant by a gauge
transformation. this will be assumed in the following. inside the chart, u : r3i 
su(2) is a continuous function. on the boundary of its domain r3  i, u has the
following values,

u(x, t) =


continuity of u implies

1
(x, 0)
u(x, t)

for t = 0 ,
for t =  ,
for |x|   .

u(x, 0) = 1 ,
u(x, ) =  .

(110)

(111)

u can therefore be interpreted as a function from s3 to su(2), and since u is
continuous, its winding number must be the opposite of the winding number of
(x, 0),

n[u] = n[(., 0)] .

(112)

since u is not periodic, it cannot be used to formulate a boundary condition for
the gauge eld by itself. we therefore introduce

u(x, t)  eit/u(x, t) with ei =  .

(113)

this function is periodic, and since eiei = , we still have

(x, t)  u +

(x, t)  u(x, t)

for

|x|   .

therefore, the instanton number is given by the winding number of u +
,

 = n[ u] = n[u ] = n[(., 0)] .

(114)

(115)

we conclude that the polyakov line at a single time contains enough information
about its time dependence to determine the instanton number. the above consid-
erations also apply to a volume enclosing a neutral set of monopoles. the polyakov
line at a single time therefore really determines the relative twist (the contribution
(103) to ) of such a set.

24

if we drop the requirement (108), the most general boundary condition for u

compatible with periodicity of  is

u(x, ) = ei(x) (x) where (x, 0) = ei(x) .

(116)

for u to be continuous, we must have

(x) = k with k  z if (x, 0) = 1 .

(117)

the relation between u(x, ) and the instanton number is, of course, still valid.

for the choice (x) = k(x), i.e. u(x, ) =(cid:0)(x, 0)(cid:1)k

number of u(., ) and therefore the instanton number are multiplied by k,

, for instance, the winding

 = n[u(., )] = kn[(., 0)] .

(118)

with other choices of , all values of  can be generated as long as monopoles are
present. in general abelian gauges, the higgs eld at a single time does not therefore
determine the instanton number, even if its eigenvalues are time-independent.

8 discussion

in this work, the instanton number has been expressed in terms of the auxiliary higgs
eld dening a general abelian gauge. on the space-time s4, the instanton number
can be written as a sum over contributions associated with individual monopole
loops,

 = xi

(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)vi(cid:3)

where vi is a topologically trivial volume containing the monopole loop in question.
the contribution of a monopole of magnetic charge m to the instanton number
modulo 2m is given in terms of the higgs eld near the monopole singularity, only,

(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)v(cid:3) mod 2m = (cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3)  z2|m|

where t is a small tube around the monopole loop and [ |t ] measures the twist
of the higgs eld on that tube. for uniform twist, it is given by the product of the
magnetic charge and the number of times the conguration is twisted as one passes
along the loop. for the generic case of unit charge monopoles, [ |t ] determines
the instanton number modulo 2, i.e., whether it is odd or even.

the full instanton number can also be expressed in terms of the higgs eld,

however not exclusively in terms of the values near monopole singularities,

(119)

(120)

(121)

(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)v(cid:3) = d(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)t(cid:3) + 2m deg(cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:12)d(cid:3)

where d denotes a (dirac) sheet closing the monopole loop. the generalized hopf
invariant d[ |t ] depends on the position of the sheet but on values of  only on t ;

25

it has the same interpretation as [ |t ]. the values of  away from the monopole
loop enter through the degree deg[ |d] of  on the sheet d. the total contribution
to the instanton number, eq. (121), is independent of the choice of d.

for unit charge monopoles, the z2 contribution (120) can be related to the center
symmetry: an odd twist (i.e., one contributing to  mod 2) can be generated by
applying a gauge transformation that changes by a factor of 1 as one passes once
along the monopole loop. such a discontinuity does not aect the gauge potential
that transforms according to the adjoint representation of the gauge group. for non-
trivial loops on s3 s1, this can be interpreted as a center symmetry transformation
that is applied to only one of the monopoles but not to the others. this is only
possible if a singularity is produced between the monopoles  or the eld between the
monopoles is altered in a way that does not correspond to a gauge transformation. of
course, such a change is necessary to alter the instanton number. for a topologically
trivial monopole loop, the gauge transformation has to be discontinuous along a two-
dimensional surface that links with the monopole loop. it produces a center-vortex
singularity on the sheet. if the singularity is avoided by altering the elds, a thick
center vortex is generated (or removed). in a recent work [26] it has been shown that
in a continuum version of the maximal center gauge the instanton number can be
related to self-intersections of center-vortices. the total number of self-intersections
is only non-zero if a (connected) vortex contains regions with dierent orientations.
since the orientation of a vortex (as dened in ref. [26]) can only change at the
world-line of a magnetic monopole, it should be possible to express the number of
self-intersections as the linking number of vortices with monopoles. our ndings
indicate that a similar relation may be valid in other center gauges, like, e.g., the
laplacian center gauge proposed in [27].

it is interesting to compare the above results with the nite-temperature instan-
ton solutions with non-trivial holonomy found recently [28, 29, 30, 31]. at high
temperatures, they can be considered as consisting of two bps monopoles [32, 33]
one of which carries a taubes winding [34]. since a0 plays the role of an eective
higgs eld in bps monopoles, these are mapped to abelian projection monopoles in
the modied axial gauge. they provide an example for the two monopoles that are
necessary for an instanton number of 1 in the modied axial gauge [20]. the taubes
winding corresponds to the twist interpretation of the generalized hopf invariant.
furthermore, it has been found that the zero mode of the dirac operator in the
eld of a caloron with non-trivial holonomy is always concentrated at the monopole
that carries the taubes winding [35]. in view of our results, one may expect a more
general relation between abelian projection monopoles and the zero modes of the
dirac operator to exist.
