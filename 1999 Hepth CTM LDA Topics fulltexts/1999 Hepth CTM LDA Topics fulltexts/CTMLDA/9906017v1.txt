abstract

it is shown in the framework of the n -component scalar model that the saddle
point structure may generate non-trivial renormalization group ow. the
spinodal phase separation can be described in this manner and a at action is
found as an exact result which is valid up to any order of the loop expansion.
the correlation function is computed in a mean-eld approximation.

i. introduction

the strategy of the renormalization group method is a successive elimination of the
degrees of freedom, a gradual simplication of the dynamical systems [1]. in statistical and
quantum physics the quantity to consider is the partition function or the path integral,
and the method consists of the successive integration over the dynamical variables. the
renormalization group is usually viewed in this manner as a technical device to sum up
the contributions of the thermal or the quantum uctuations. the result, the renormalized
trajectory is used to assess the importance and the eects of the uctuations of a given scale.
the goal of this paper is to show that the renormalization group can be non-trivial even
in the absence of the uctuations. the uctuations and the mean values are the easiest to
separate by means of the saddle-point expansion. it will be shown that the saddle point can
induce a non-trivial renormalization, independently of the uctuations.

in order to make our point clearer consider rst a lattice model with topological defects,

z = yx z d(x)e 1

h s[(x)].

(1)

the topological defects of the size a (a is the lattice spacing) minimize the action and
the tree level o(h0) contributions to the saddle point approximation can be written as a

(2)

the fraction of the topological defects which are on the surface of the blocks is supressed
by /n. most of the topological defects are inside of a block and they can be thought as the
saddle point congurations in the elimination of the variables of the given block. as long as
the topological defects are present the blocking has a tree-level, non-uctuating contribution.
naturally the inhomogeneous saddle points break external symmetries which provide plenty
of zero modes. the integration over them captures some eects of the uctuations. the
dierence between the tree-level contribution and the genuine uctuations might seem to be
reduced to a technical issue at this point. but the coupling constant dependence is always
more complicated and singular at the tree-level than it is in the loop contributions. thus
the scaling laws extracted from the tree- or the loop-level terms might be radically dierent
[2,3].

the regulator of the path integral, the cuto  in the momentum space, is not written
explicitely. we select the parameters of the action in such a manner that the o(n) symmetry
is spontaneously broken in the vacuum. as  is chosen to be smaller than the amplitude
of the eld in the vacuum,  < h|~(x)|i, one expects metastable or unstable behavior for
certain modes. we shall nd non-trivial saddle points in this case during the blocking. the
saddle point expansion actually oers a systematical treatment of the metastable phase or
the spinodal instabilities. the resulting eective action for the unstable phase is found to
be at. it is remarkable that this result goes beyond the tree-approximation and remains
valid to every order of h. domain walls are reproduced as the saddle points in the spinodal
phase separation and we obtain the maxwell-construction for the free energy, vef f (). a
similar problem has already been discussed for n = 1 by keeping track of simple saddle
points numerically in ref. [4]. the present paper generalises the results presented there and
relies on analytical methods, based on continuity assumptions infered from the numerical
study.

the saddle point approximation is used in two dierent manners in the paper. this is
because we use the dierential form of the renormalization group equations and we have
two small parameters at our disposal. one is h to organize the loop-expansion and the
other is the fraction of the modes to be eliminated in a blocking step,  = (1  /n)d in the

2

example mentioned above. the usual saddle point approximation is recovered when the limit
h  0 is taken at nite . this is sucient to provide a well dened renormalization group
ow. but the minimum of the action becomes highly degenerate when the innitesimal
form of the renormalization group method is employed, i.e. the limit   0 is made before
h  0. the disadvantage of the degeneracy of the eective action is that the saddle point
approximation is in general spoiled. this is because the minimum at the saddle point is
shallow, the curvature of the action being o(). but the determination of the eective action
remains reliable since  not only makes the action at but enters as a supression factor for the
loop corrections, as well. such a double role of  is behind an unusual feature of the saddle
point expansion: the appearence of uctuations in the order o(h0). the advantage of the
degeneracy is an enormous simplication of the functional integration which is demonstrated
by the mean-eld computation of the correlation function. the uctuations arising in o(h0)
have no restoring force to the equilibrium position, a characteristic feature of the mixed
phase of the rst order phase transitions.

the organization of the paper is the following. section ii. introduces the innitesimal
renormalization step which provides a more powerful version of the renormalization group
equation. a simple and important property of the renormalized action in the unstable
region is presented in section iii for a scalar model. the renormalized trajectory is given in
section iv and section v contains a brief analysis of the correlation function obtained on
the tree-level. finally, section vi is for the summary.

ii. infinitesimal renormalization

we introduce the innitesimal renormalization group in this section. the traditional
kadano-wilson blocking transformations in the fourier space is the lowering of the cut-o
k  k  k,

h skk[~] = z d[ ~]e 1
e 1

h sk[~+ ~],

(5)

where ~ has fourier components for |p|  k  k and ~ for k  k < |p|  k [1]. this
blocking is innitesimal if the number of modes eliminated is small compared to the number
of the left over modes in the system,

 =

k
k

<< 1.

(6)

the one-loop approximation to the blocking (5) yields the exact renormalization group
equations as   0 [5]. the exactness comes from the fact that the functional integral (5)
becomes gaussian when   0 because the higher-loop contribution are suppresed by the
volume of the momentum integration region,

and each eigenvalue of the inverse propagator 2s[~ + ~k]/ ~ ~ is positive. the appare-
ance of the product h in the higher order corrections indicates the presence of the new
small parameter  which renders the one-loop evolution equation exact. by performing the
integration we nd

(9)

where ik[] is an integral over one fourier component and nd/2 is the number of modes to
eliminate in the shell k  k  |p|  k. the factor 1/2 comes from the reality condition
(p) = (p) and

nd =

(10)

where d is the solid angle in d dimensions. the evolution in the cuto is given by the

(11)

one should bear in mind that the infrared eld ~ is kept constant in computing this func-
tional derivative. assuming that the saddle point is trivial, ~k = 0, we obtain

(12)

the limit k  0 is safe because the trace is always o(k). this is not necessarily so in the
general case (11) where the saddle point ~k is supposed to have a nite limit as k  0.

the tree-level renormalization group equation, c.f. (37) below, can be obtained for any
suciently smooth action functional. but in order to convert the complicated functional
equation into a system of coupled dierential equations for the renormalized coupling con-
stants one needs an ansatz, a certain functional form for the action. this is usually given
by the gradient expansion, by assuming that all important terms of the action are local. we
shall consider the lowest order contributions of this expansion which are compatible with
rotational invariance in euclidean d-dimensional space,

sk[~] = z ddx(cid:20) 1

(16)

where d is the solid angle in dimension d. notice that the arguments of the logarithm is the
inverse curvature of the action at the minimum and each of them is supposed to be positive,
being proportional to the restoring force acting on the uctuations around the vacuum. the
solution u0() corresponding to the initial condition u() = u() imposed at k =  gives
the eective potential, the energy density of the vacum of the constrained model (3).

the uctuations are stable in the o(n) symmetrical phase,

k2 + 2

uk() > 0,

and

k2 + uk() > 0.

(17)

if either of these inequalities is violated then the innitesimal uctuations around the given
 become unstable. this is the case with spontaneously broken symmetries. in fact, the
arguments of the logarithm are decreasing monotonically as the cuto k is lowered but they
stay positive in the symmetrical phase. the symmetry broken phase is characterised by
having a nite cuto value k = kcr, where (17) is violated. the loop-expansion is clearly
inapplicable for k  kcr. since the goldstone modes are the lightest excitations it is always
the second inequality in (17) which indicates this instability.

let us introduce (k), the curve on the plane (, k) where (17) is rst violated as k
is decreased. the function (k) is decreasing and the uctuations around the constrained
vacuum of (3) with momentum p < kcr are unstable if  < p. this is the spinodal unstable
phase where uctuations with innitesimal amplitude are already unstable. the wegner-
houghton equation (12) does not apply any more in this regime because one has to take
into account the non-trivial saddle points as in (11). the equation (12) should in principle
be renounced for any value of  when k < kcr. this is because the congurations whose
action receives contributions from the spinodal unstable regions are not treated in a reliable
manner. but the strategy of the loop epxansion oers the remedy by assuming that the
amplitude of the uctuations is innitesimal. thus one may use the simple equation (12)
even for k < kcr when   (k) because the uctuations which are treated in an unrealiable
manner are strongly suppressed.

we encounter an important simplication by noting that the loop expansion is applicable
in the stable region,   (k). in fact, we can use the simplest tree-level approximation
in the stable region to obtain an evaluation of (k). the k dependence is simply ignored in
o(h0), uk() = u(). the condition determining the curve (k) is then

k2(k) + u((k)) = 0.

(18)

the approach of the instability with n = 1 has been examined numerically in the local
potential approximation (zk = 1) [7]. the spinodal region was considered, as well, where
nontrivial saddle points appear in the functional integration of the uv modes [4]. we give
below an analytic derivation of the renormalized trajectory in the spinodal instability region
for a n-component eld in the approximation (13).

iii. degeneracy of the action

the characteristic feature of the eective action generated by the saddle points is a high
level of degeneracy [4]. to understand its implication we rst note that the usual saddle
point approximation to the eective action or potential where all degrees of freedom are
treated in the loop-expansion is based on an extended saddle point at zero momentum or
a gas of localized solutions which include all momenta. the uctuations around the saddle
point are orthogonal to the saddle point conguration and are suppressed by h. but the
saddle points of the innitesimal blocking step appear dierently. suppose that k is so
small that we can neglect the dependence of the fourier transform (p) of the eld variable
on the length |p| between k  k and k. we may then look at (7) as a path integration for
a system on the d  1 dimensional sphere, sd1. the d  1 dimensional action, s(d1)
[]
is labeled by the parameter k.
it will be shown that the continuous dependence of the
action in k makes s(d1)
kk [] degenerate up to corrections o(k). this weak variation of the
action is enough to support the loop-expansion but can not suppress the uctuations which
are non-orthogonal to the saddle point for nite but small k. this complication does not
inuence the value of the running coupling constants, the renormalization group ow. when
the successive elimination process of the renormalization group method is used to carry out
the path integral for some observables in the limit k  0 then the following, dierent
strategy is employed: we simplify the path integration enormously by taking into account
that the eective action for each momentum shell is degenerate in the unstable region. this
degeneracy is reminescent of the maxwell construction for the coexisiting phase of the rst
order phase transitions. the key element of both strategies, the o(k) degeneracy of the
action is the subject of this section.

k

before embarking the general argument we remark that the problem of nding the sad-
dle points of the model with n > 1 can be reduced to the case n = 1 if the action is
monotonically increasing with (~)2, like in (13). to see this let us write

~(x) + ~k(x) = k(x)r(x)~e

(19)

where r(x) is a so(n) matrix and ~e the unit vector giving the orientation of ~ in the
internal space. the saddle point is a local minimum of the action whose dependence in r
is coming by r. since

(~ +  ~k)2 = kk + 2

kr~er~e,

(20)

the minimum is reached by a homogeneous r, in which case ~k must be parallel to ~e. thus
the saddle point of the model n > 1 reduces to the case n = 1, which we consider below
for the sake of simplicity.

the proof of the degeneracy of the eective action is based on the following assumptions:

1. the continuity of sk[] as the functions of k for a xed conguration  in the unstable

region,

2. the innite dierentiability of sk[] with respect to  for any xed value of k in the

unstable region,

6

3. the continuity of sk[] and sk[]/(x) on the spinodal line, (x) = (k).

the saddle point conguration is a solution of the non-linear equation of motion. we
have to perform the gaussian approximation in (7) for each saddle point and sum up the
contributions. let us denote the renormalized action resulting from the saddle point k,
by skk,[], where  stands for the zero modes of the saddle point. the tree-level renor-
malization arises because the saddle point depends on the background eld and (9) leads
to

skk,[] = sk [ + k,[]] + o(h).

(21)

in order to nd the evolution of the functional derivatives of the action one has to keep in
mind that the independent variables are the fourier components  and k. thus one has
to read the action as a functionnal of the fourier components:

we shall suppress the index  in the expressions below. the condition (21) then implies

sk[ + k,[]] = skh , k,[]i .

since k is the saddle point,

we have

(24)

(25)

the higher derivatives are obtained by taking the successive functional derivatives of (5)

(30)

the derivative of the saddle point is supposed to be nonvanishing even as   0. since the
background eld  can be chosen arbitrarily we conclude that

2sk

 (q) (p)

[ + k] = 0

for k  k < |q|  k.

but if we take the derivative of (24) with respect to (p), we nd

2sk

(2)d

2sk

 (q) (q)

[ + k]

(31)

(32)

because of the non vanishing of the derivative of the saddle point when   0, (31) and (32)
imply that

2sk

 (p) (q)

[ + k] = 0

for k  k < |p|, |q|  k.

(33)

one can easily nd by induction, that for any n  1

nsk

 (p1)... (pn)

[ + k] = 0

for k  k < |p1|,    , |pn|  k.

(34)

therefore if  has non vanishing fourier components for |p| between k and k  k and 
is the background eld (with non vanishing fourier components for |p|  k  k), we can
write,

sk[ + ] =



xn=0

nsk

 (k1)     (kn)

[ + k] = sk[ + k]

(35)

what we found is that sk does not depend on the fourier components |p| = k in the
unstable region. this result is independent of the choice of the saddle point k. the tree-
level renormalization makes the action at in the modes to be eliminated.

note that the continuity of sk[] in k for a xed  was needed in our argument. in fact,
the conclusion about the atness is reached for sk[], the initial condition of the innitesimal
blocking step. this initial condition must be close to the result of the blocking, skk[]

8

according to the continuity of the renormalization group ow in k. thus our assumptions 1
and 2 yield the atness of the action within the instable region.

it is important to keep in mind that this atness holds up to corrections o(k) so
the egienvalues of the propagator in computing the functional integral (7) are o(hk1).
taking into account that the integration volume o(k), the one-loop correction to the tree-
level result is o(h), as usual. thus there is no arbitrary small parameter, like , available
in separating the tree- and the (one)loop-level contributions to the renormalization group
equation. in other words, the simplication oered by the smallness of the loop integration
volume suppresses the higher-loop contributions only and leaves both the tree and the one-
loop contributions important.

the summation over the saddle points gives nally (with the dependence on  properly

displayed)

h skk[] =

n []

x z dxf (x)e 1

h sk[+k,] = e 1

h sk[+k,0 ]

n []

(36)

where x stands for the zero modes of the saddle point k(),  = 1,    , n[], and f (x)
is the corresponding integration measure. since the change of the number of the saddle
points, n[] is necesseraly discontinuous in (x), and the zero mode integral is always nite
with inhomogeneous saddle points, the assumption 3 asserts that n[] is constant. the zero
mode entropy can thus be ignored, giving

skk[] = sk[ + k(0)] + o(h),

(37)

where k(0) is an arbitrary saddle point.

iv. renormalization group flow

we present a solution of the renormalization group equation (37) in this section. the

argument is based on the assumption 3.

the solution of the tree-level evolution equation is largly simplied by the high degree
of the degeneracy, (35). this allows us to use a simple saddle point to evaluate skk[].
we use a plane wave

k(x) = 2k cos(k (k)x + (k))

(38)

where the unit vector (k) and the phase (k) are the collective coordinates corresponding
to the zero modes. the breakdown of the o(d) rotational symmetry gives rise to . we
tacitely assumed large but nite quantization box with periodic boundary conditions which
guarantees the translational symmetry. the translation in the direction of (k) is no longer
symmetry, the corresponding zero mode is (k).

the value of the action (13) at (x) =  + 2 cos(kx) is

d sk[] = uk() +



xn=1

(39)

we have seen with (35) that the action is -independent and thus the coecient of 2n
vanishes,

 uk() = 0,

therefore we nd

zk() = z(k)

uk() = 

z(k)k22 + u(k)

(40)

(41)

for an even potential.

according to the assumption 3 the saddle point k is a continous function of the back-
ground  at  = (k). this implies that uk(), zk() together with uk() and zk()
are continous functions, as well, for  = (k) because the saddle point is found by setting
the rst derivative of the action to zero. the continuity of zk() leads to

(42)

where the quantities in the stable ( > (k)) and the unstable region ( < (k)) are
supplied by a subscript st and unst, respectively. z st
k ((k)) comes from the solution of
the wegner-houghton equation in the stable region.

as a consequence of the continuity of uk() in , we nd:

(43)

(44)

here both z st
tion in the stable region.

k ((k)) and u st

k ((k)) are given by the solution of the wegner-houghton equa-

note the disapparence of n from the equation. one would have thought that the gold-
stone modes which go unstable earlier as the cuto is lowered make dierent boundary (k)
for n > 1 and n = 1. but it turned out that the instability line for n = 1 is given by (44)
instead of the vanishing of the rst factor in the right hand side of (16).

it is important to note that in the limit k  0 the potential in (42) recovers the maxwell
construction: the eective potential uef f = uk=0 is a at function of the eld between the
minima k=0. the maxwell construction which is a well-known feature of the vaccum of
the coexisting phase has been seen numerically in [4]. the potential (42) has already been
reported in the approximation z = 1 for n = 3 with a smooth cuto by retaining the simple
plane wave saddle point [9]. but the smooth cuto makes other saddle points than the single
plane wave important. our result, valid for any n underlines the generality of the maxwell
construction. the limit n   can be used, as well, to obtain the maxwell construction

10

[10]. but it remains an unjustied step in this scheme to ignore the massive mode. the
formal argument is that the n  1 goldstone modes overweight the single massive mode.
since the saddle point appears in this latter the large n scheme can not trace down the
stabilisation mechanism in the spinodal phase.

finally we mention the simple relation satised by the amplitude of the plane-wave

saddle point,

k(p) = k()hei(k)(k (k)  p) + ei(k)(k (k) + p)i

k(x) = 2k() cos(k (k)x + (k))

(45)

we found that the action is at for the eld whose magnitude is less than (k). since the
action must increase if the eld goes beyond this limit we have

(k) = maxx { + k(x)} =  + 2k()

(46)

to determine the amplitude k. first we note that the saddle point, as well as its functional
derivative with respert to the eld have non vanishing limits when   0, as we expected
when giving the arguments leading to a at action. then it is instructive to take the
limit k  0. the saddle point becomes homogeneous with the amplitude 20(), and it
can be interpreted as the polarization of the vacuum due to the external eld . the
lesson of (46) is that the external eld plus the polarization always add up to (0), the
vacuum expectation value. this complete screening of the external eld is the result of
the degeneracy of the eective action and is in agreement with the maxwell construction.

v. correlation function

the characteristic feature of the saddle point approximation is the large number of zero
modes, the high degree of degeneracy of the action. this makes the tree-level contribution
to the correlation functions highly non-trivial. we demonstrate this by computing the
correlation function for the constrained model (3)

,m(p, q) =

h s[+],

(47)

in the mean-eld approximation where only one plane-wave mode is retained on a homo-
geneous background . the mean eld approximation consists of keeping a single variable
active in the path integral in the presence of a non-trivial background. one usually follows
this strategy on a real space lattice where a site variable is itegrated over in the presence of
a homogeneous background eld. such a mean-eld approximation is inacceptable within
the spinodal unstable phase. instead, we suggest to make this approximation in the mo-
mentum space. the living mode will be a plane wave on the background of . the plane
wave will take large amplitude which creates an inhomogeneous ground state supporting the
phase separation. the average amplitude of the plane-wave may serve as a measure of the
readyness of the system to create the phase separation with a given length scale.

the shallow action is always a potential threat for the loop-expansion. this problem was
circumvented in the computation of the tree-level renormalization group by noting that the

11

number of modes contributing to the loop integrals is small, as well. this is not a sucient
argument any more to suppress the contributions of the uctuations around the shallow
minima for the expectation values, such as (47). what happens is that the uctuations
within the shallow part of the action do contribute to (47) in o(h0). when the successive
integration of the renormalization group procedure is used for the evaluation of the path
integral in the limit k  0 then we may disregard the saddle point structure and make
the integration within each momentum shell, using the appropriate eective action. this
integration is simplied in the unstable region where the eective action is at. thus the
system is strongly disordered in terms of the fourier transformed variables (p) within
the mixed phase due to the absence of the restoring force acting on the uctuations around
the vacuum.

the o(h0) contribution to (47) is be obtained by restricting the integration into the

regime where the eective action is at and therefore

= l,m(cid:20)z d[~](cid:21)1z d[~] l(p) l(q),

(48)

where r d stands for the integration over the functional space where the action is at. the

approximation for the computation of the correlation function consists in replacing the elds
by plane waves, just as the saddle points, but for which we will integrate the amplitude over
the whole range where the action is at, because of the degeneracy of the latter. we will
call n the solid angle in the internal space and  the angle between the azimutal axis and
the eld ~. let kp be the momentum of the plane wave. we will then take

l(p) = rl(p)heip(p  kp) + eip(p + kp)i

(49)

and we will summ over all the possible orientations of kp. in the internal space, we have
rl = r cos l and the correlation function is in this approximation

g

,m = l,m(cid:20)z d[k]d[]d[n ]d[r](cid:21)1z d[k]d[]d[n ]d[r]r(p)r(q) cos p cos q
heip(p  kp) + eip(p + kp)iheiq (q  kq) + eiq (q + kq)i

(50)

the integration over the phases  will give a result dierent from 0 only if |p| = |q|, otherwise
p and q are independant variables and therefore remain only the terms where we have the
dierence p  q and one summation over the direction of k = kp = kq, which we can take
as a summation over k because of the dirac distributions. the correlation function is

this expression diers from the correlation function given in ref. [4] for n = 1 because of
the integration over the o(h0) uctuations which yield a multiplicative constant only. note
that the integration over the phase  restored the translational invariance.

the integration region over the modulus is given by (46):

p() =

(54)

and it extends over the plane waves for which the action is degenerate. the real-space
correlation function can easily be obtained in closed form as a function of |~x  ~y| = r in

of the large amplitude oscillations due to the domain wall structure is macr = k1

the qualitative dierence between the correlation function in the stable phase and (55): the
spinodal instability induces a non-monotical behaviour, coming from the trigonometrical
functions, instead of the exponential decrease.

vi. summary

it is demonstrated that the tree-level contributions to the blocking relation may induce
a non-trivial renormalization. whenever this happens the system displays instabilities and
the vacuum is inhomogeneous and highly non-trivial.

the assumption of the continuity of the eective action in the cuto within the unstable
region allows us to show that the action is at in the unstable region. this result is valid in
each order of the loop expansion. the atness gives rise the maxwell construction for the
free energy. a diraction pattern-like correlation function was obtained in the mean-eld
approximation.

13

our argument is based on the euclidean eld theory and as such can be relevant for
the description of equilibrium states. it is important to mention that one can, in principle,
repeat the steps in the minkowski space-time. the result is a dynamical renormalization
group approach to the formation of the condensate. a somehow similar program has already
been followed in ref. [11] which supports the atness of the eective potential in the spinodal
unstable region.

the sharp momentum space cuto is used in this work. it is well known that the strong
dependence on the momentum at the cuto induces non-local behavior in the real space
which in turn spoils the gradient expansion [8]. though this does not happen in the tree-
level, discussed in this paper, it remains to be seen if the loop corrections can be summed
up in a consistent scheme in the exterior, stable regime.
