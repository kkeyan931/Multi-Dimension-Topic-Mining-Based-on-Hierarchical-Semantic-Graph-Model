bousso has conjectured that in any spacetime satisfying einsteins equation and satisfying the
dominant energy condition, the entropy ux s through any null hypersurface l generated by
geodesics with non-positive expansion starting from some spacelike 2 surface of area a must satisfy
s  a/4gh. this conjecture reformulates earlier conjectured entropy bounds of bekenstein and also
of fischler and susskind, and can be interpreted as a statement of the so-called holographic principle.
we extend boussos entropy bound to a stronger bound which directly implies the generalized second
law of thermodynamics. we show that our stronger entropy bound can be derived from either of
two sets of hypotheses. the rst set of hypotheses is (i) associated with each null surface l in
spacetime there is an entropy ux 4-vector sa
l whose integral over l is the entropy ux through
l, and (ii) along each null geodesic generator of l, we have |sa
lka|  (  )tabkakb/h, where
tab is the stress-energy tensor,  is an ane parameter, ka = (d/d)a, and  is the value of
ane parameter at the endpoint of the geodesic. the second (purely local) set of hypotheses is (i)
there exists an absolute entropy ux 4-vector sa such that the entropy ux through any null surface
l is the integral of sa over l, and (ii) this entropy ux 4-vector obeys the pointwise inequalities
(saka)2  tabkakb/(16h2g) and |kakbasb|  tabkakb/(4h) for any null vector ka.

i. introduction and summary

a. background and motivation

in recent years, a number of independent universal en-
tropy bounds have been postulated to hold for arbitrary
systems. the rst such bound was conjectured by beken-
stein, who proposed that the entropy s and energy e of
any matter put into a box must obey [1]

s/e  2r,

(1.1)

where r denotes some suitable measure of the size of the
box.
[throughout this paper, we use units with g =
c = h = k = 1.] the original motivation for the bound
(1.1) was the belief that it is necessary for the validity
of the generalized second law of thermodynamics (gsl),
which states that in all physical processes, the generalized
entropy

s = s + sbh

(1.2)

must always increase, where s is the entropy of matter
outside of black holes, sbh = ah /4, and ah denotes

the total surface area of all black hole horizons. subse-
quently it was shown [24] that the bound (1.1) is not
necessary for the validity of the generalized second law.
in addition, the bound fails when the number of species
of particles is suciently large. finally, it is far from
clear what the precise meaning of r in the conjecture

very recently, bekenstein [5] has used the fact that the
buoyancy formulas must be modied due to nite box size ef-
fects to again argue that a bound of the form (1.1) is needed
for the validity of the gsl. however, we believe that an anal-
ysis of the type given in [3] could be used to show that no
such entropy bound is needed. indeed, if a violation of the
gsl could be obtained in any process involving the quasi-
static lowering of a box toward a black hole, then we expect
that it should be possible to obtain a violation of the ordinary
second law by a similar quasi-static lowering of a box into a
real star composed of unconstrained thermal matter.
in the canonical ensemble, it is easy to show that the bound
(1.1) also fails at suciently low temperatures for all sys-
tems whose ground state energy vanishes. however, a de-
tailed analysis of a variety of systems given in ref. [6] pro-
vides strong evidence that this failure does not occur in the

1

is supposed to be, particularly in curved spacetime. nev-
ertheless, a case can be made that the bound (1.1) may
hold for all physically realistic systems found in nature;
see ref. [6] for further discussion.

more recently, an alternative entropy bound has been
considered: the entropy s inside any region whose bound-
ary has area a must satisfy [7]

s  a/4.

(1.3)

an argument given in ref. [8] suggests that the bound
(1.3) should follow from the gsl together with the as-
sumption that the entropy of a black hole counts the
number of possible internal states of the black hole.
in addition, when e <
 r, this bound would follow
from the original bekenstein bound (1.1). the inequality
(1.3), like the bound (1.1), can be violated if the number
of massless particle species is allowed to be arbitrarily
large. the inequality (1.3) is related to the hypothe-
sis known as the holographic principle, which states that
the physics in any spatial region can be fully described
in terms of degrees of freedom living on the boundary of
that region, with one degree of freedom per planck area
[10,8]. if the holographic principle is correct, then since
the entropy in any region should be bounded above by
the number of fundamental degrees of freedom in that
region, a bound of the form (1.3) should be valid for all
systems, including those with strong self-gravity.

as it stands, the bound (1.3) is ambiguous, since the
precise meaning of the bounding area, a, has not been
spelled out. in particular, note that any world tube can

microcanonical ensemble.
the argument is attributed to bekenstein in ref. [8] and
goes as follows. if black hole entropy counts the number of
internal states of a black hole, then any system having s 
a/4 is not a black hole. then, one would expect to be able to
make that system into a black hole with area a by collapsing a
suciently massive spherical shell of matter around it. in this
process, it appears that no entropy escapes, but this means
that we convert an s  a/4 system into a black hole of area
a, violating the generalized second law. an antecedent to
this argument can be found in ref. [9].
 for example, consider n free massless scalar elds in at
spacetime, in a cube of edge length l with dirichlet bound-
ary conditions. in the canonical ensemble, the thermal state
with temperature t with t  1/l has energy e which scales
as e  n exp[/(lt )]/l, and entropy s which scales like
s  n exp[/(lt )]/(lt ). for the system to be weakly
self-gravitating (a necessary condition for the at-spacetime
analysis to be a good approximation) we must have e = l
for some   1. using this restriction to solve for the maxi-
mum allowed value of n yields s/l2  /(lt ), which can be
arbitrarily large. in the microcanonical ensemble, the viola-
tion of (1.3) for suciently large n follows immediately from
the fact that the density of states at a xed total energy e
grows unboundedly with n at xed l.

always be enclosed by a two-surface of arbitrarily small
area, since given any two-surface in spacetime, there ex-
ists a two-surface of arbitrarily small area arbitrarily
close to the original two-surface (obtained by wiggling
the original two-surface suitably in spacetime). however,
very recently, a specic conjecture of the form (1.3) was
suggested by bousso [11,12], who improved an earlier sug-
gestion of fischler and susskind [13,14]. bousso showed
that several example spacetimes, including cosmological
models and gravitational collapse spacetimes, are consis-
tent with his conjecture.

boussos conjecture is as follows. let (m, gab) be
a spacetime satisfying einsteins equation and also the
dominant energy condition [15]. let b be a connected
2 dimensional spacelike surface in m . suppose that ka
is a smooth null vector eld on b which is everywhere
orthogonal to b. then the expansion

 = aka

(1.4)

of ka is well dened and is independent of how ka is
extended o b. suppose that   0 everywhere on b.
let l denote the null hypersurface generated by the null
geodesics starting at b with initial tangent ka, where
each null geodesic is terminated if and only if a caustic
is reached (where   ), and otherwise is extended
as far as possible. then the entropy ux, sl, through l
satises

sl  ab/4,

(1.5)

where ab is the area of b.

there is a close relationship between boussos conjec-
ture and the generalized second law. consider a foliation
of the horizon of a black hole by spacelike two-surfaces
b(), where  is a continuous label that increases in the
future direction. let a() be the area of the two surface
b(), and let s() be the total entropy that crosses the
horizon before the 2-surface b(). then if one assumes
the ordinary second law, the gsl is equivalent to the
statement that for any 1 < 2 we have

s(2)  s(1) 

1
4

[a(2)  a(1)] .

(1.6)

on the other hand, boussos entropy bound applied to
the 2-surface b()with ka taken to be the past di-
rected normal to the horizon, so that we have   0
on b() when the null energy condition is satised
demands merely that

s() 

1
4

a()

(1.7)

for all . thus, boussos bound implies that the gsl
holds for the case when the initial time, 1, is taken to
be the time when the black hole is rst formed [so that
s(1) = a(1) = 0]. in general, however, it is clear that
the statement (1.7) is weaker than the statement (1.6).

2

this observation motivates a generalization of boussos
conjecture. namely, if one allows the geodesics generat-
ing the hypersurface l to terminate at some spacelike
2-surface b before coming to a caustic or singularity,
one can replace the conjectured inequality (1.5) by the
condition

sl 

1
4

[ab  ab  ] .

(1.8)

in this paper we shall prove the more general entropy
bound (1.8) under certain assumptions concerning the
local entropy content of matter. it is clear from the above
discussion that this more general bound implies both the
original bousso entropy bound and the gsl (assuming
of course the validity of the ordinary second law). we
note that proofs of the gsl that are more general than
the proof of this paper have previously been given [16];
however the previous proofs used specic properties of
black-hole spacetimes, unlike our analysis.

finally, we note that, as discussed further at the end
of section iii, our results can be generalized straightfor-
wardly to arbitrary spacetime dimensions greater than
two.

b. derivations of entropy bound and of generalized
second law: framework, viewpoint and assumptions

the starting point for our derivation of the generalized
entropy bound (1.8) is a postulated phenomenological
description of entropy, which diers from assumptions
that have been used in the past to derive the gsl [16]. in
this section we describe our phenomenological description
of entropy and its motivation.

first, note that one of the hypotheses of boussos con-
jecture is the dominant energy condition, which is often
violated by the expected stress energy tensor of matter in
semiclassical gravity. hence the conjecture cannot have
the status of a fundamental law as it is currently stated,
but rather can only be relevant in classical regimes
where the dominant energy condition is satised [17]. it
may be possible to replace the dominant energy condition
by a quantum inequality of the type invented by ford and
roman [1822] to overcome this diculty. in this pa-
per we will assume the null convergence condition, that

lowe [17] argues that the bousso conjecture must fail for
a system consisting of an evaporating black hole accreting at
just the right rate to balance the hawking radiation mass
loss. for such a system, it would seem that the black hole
can accrete an arbitrary amount of entropy without changing
its area, and in addition it is hard to see how a modied
bousso conjecture incorporating a quantum inequality rather
than a local energy condition could be satised. however, this
counterexample might be resolved by the fact that it may be
appropriate to assign a negative entropy ux at the horizon to

3

tabkakb  0 for all null vectors ka [see eqs. (1.9) and
(1.10)(1.11) below], which is weaker than the dominant
energy condition. thus, our proof of boussos conjecture,
like the conjecture itself, is limited to classical regimes
in which local energy conditions are satised.

clearly, in order to derive the bound (1.8), we must
make some assumptions about entropy. the entropy that
the conjecture refers to presumably should include grav-
itational contributions. it seems plausible that any grav-
itational entropy ux through the null hypersurface l
will be associated with a shearing of that hypersurface,
which has the same qualitative eect in the raychaudhuri
equation [see eq. (2.12) below] as a matter stress-energy
ux. thus, it may be possible to treat gravitational con-
tributions to entropy in a manner similar to the matter
contributions. however, our present understanding of
quantum gravity is not sucient to attempt to meaning-
fully quantify the gravitational contributions to entropy.
consequently, in our analysis below, we shall consider
only the matter contributions to entropy.

with regard to the matter contribution to entropy, for
both the gsl and the bousso bound, there is an appar-
ent tension between the fact that these statements are
supposed to have the status of fundamental laws and the
fact that entropy is a quantity whose denition is coarse-
graining dependent. however, this tension is resolved by
noting that the number of degrees of freedom should be
an upper bound for the entropy s, irrespective of choice
of coarse-graining [12]. equivalently, we may restrict at-
tention to the case where the matter is locally in thermal
equilibrium (i.e., maximum entropy density for its given
energy density); if the bound holds in this case, it must
hold in all cases.

we shall proceed by assuming that a phenomenologi-
cal description of matter entropy can be given in terms
of an entropy ux 4-vector sa. we shall then postulate
some properties of sa.
in fact, we shall postulate two
independent sets of hypotheses on sa, each of which will
be sucient to prove the bound (1.8). note that, at a
fundamental level, entropy is a non-local quantity and
so can be well described by a entropy ux 4-vector only
in certain regimes and over certain scales. this fact is
reected in our hypotheses below.

the rst of our two sets of hypotheses is very much in
the spirit of the original bekenstein bound (1.1). suppose
that one has a null hypersurface, l, the generators of
which terminate at a nite value  of ane parameter
. suppose that one puts matter in a box and drops it
through l in such a way that the back end of the box
crosses l at . then, if a bound of the nature of (1.1)
holds, the amount of entropy crossing l should be limited
by the energy within the box and the box size. the box

states with an outgoing hawking ux, or it might be resolved
by making adjustments to the bousso conjecture.

size, in turn, would be related to the ane parameter at
which the front end of the box crossed l. on the other
hand, suppose that matter owing through l near 
were not conned by a box. then there would be no box
size restriction on the entropy ux near . however,
in order to have a larger entropy ux than one could
achieve when using a box, it clearly would be necessary
to put the matter in a state where the modes carrying
the entropy spill over beyond . in that case, it is
far from clear that the entropy carried by these modes
should be credited as arriving prior to , so that they
would count in the entropy ux through l.
in other
words, it seems reasonable to postulate that the entropy
ux through l cannot be higher than the case where the
matter is placed in a box whose back end crosses l at
, and to consider a bound on this entropy ux of the
general form of eq. (1.1).

the above considerations motivate the following hy-
pothesis concerning the entropy ux. we assume that
associated with every null surface l, there is an entropy
ux 4-vector sa
l from which one can compute the entropy
ux through l. let  be a null geodesic generator of l,
with ane parameter  and tangent ka = (d/d)a. if 
is of innite ane parameter length, then tabkakb = 0
along  by the focusing theorem [15], and we assume that
sa
l = 0 along . on the other hand, if  ends at a nite
value, , of ane parameter, then we assume that

|sa
lka|  (  )tabkakb.

(1.9)

the inequality (1.9) is a direct analog of the original
bekenstein bound (1.1), with |sa
lka| playing the role of s,
tabkakb playing the role of e, and  playing the role
of r. as discussed above, the motivation for the bound
(1.9) is essentially the same as that for the bound (1.1).
note that eq. (1.9) is independent of choice of ane pa-
rameterization of , i.e., both sides of this equation scale
the same way under a change of ane parameter.

the above set of hypotheses has the property that
the entropy ux, sa
lka, depends upon l in the sense
(described above) that modes that only partially pass
through l prior to  do not contribute to the entropy
ux. in our second set of hypotheses, we assume the ex-
istence of an absolute entropy ux 4-vector sa, which is
independent of the choice of l. we assume that this sa
obeys the following purely local, pointwise inequalities
for any null vector ka

from eq. (2.12), our proof also works if we replace the
hypothesis (1.9) with the weaker hypotheses that

|sa

lka|  (  )(cid:2)tabkakb + ab ab/8(cid:3) ,

where ab is the shear tensor [eq. (9.2.28) of ref. [15]] as-
sociated with the generators of l.
in this context, we can
interpret sa
l to be the combined matter and gravitational en-
tropy ux, rather than just the matter entropy ux.

and

(saka)2  1 tabkakb

|kakbasb|  2 tabkakb,

(1.10)

(1.11)

where tab is the stress-energy tensor . here 1 and 2
can be any positive constants that satisfy

(1)1/4 + (2/)1/2 = 1.

(1.12)

[recall that we are using planck units with g = c = h =
k = 1.] a specic simple choice of 1 and 2 that satisfy
the condition (1.12) is 1 = 1/(16) and 2 = /4, which
are the values quoted in the abstract above. note that,
like eq. (1.9), eqs. (1.10) and (1.11) are independent of
the choice of scaling of ka. also note that both of our
sets of hypotheses (1.9) and (1.10)(1.11) imply the null
convergence condition tabkakb  0, as mentioned above.
we now turn to a discussion of the physical regimes
in which we expect the pointwise assumptions (1.10) and
(1.11) of our second set of hypotheses to be valid. the
rst assumption (1.10) of our second set of hypothe-
ses says, roughly speaking, that the entropy density is
bounded above by the square root of the energy density.
one can check that the condition is satised for ther-
mal equilibrium states of bose and fermi gases except at

the stress energy tensor appearing in these inequalities
should be interpreted as a macroscopic or averaged stress
energy tensor tab, rather than a microscopic stress energy
tensor tab. for example, for an atomic gas, the fundamen-
tal microscopic stress-energy tensor tab will vary rapidly over
atomic and nuclear scales, while a suitable averaged macro-
scopic stress tensor tab can be taken to vary only over macro-
scopic scales (like the conventional entropy current sa). thus
our results apply to null surfaces l of an averaged, macro-
scopic metric gab rather than the physical metric gab [23].
note that null surfaces of gab can dier signicantly from the
null surfaces of gab, since with suitable microscopic sources
(for example cosmic strings) a null surface of gab can be made
to intersect itself very frequently without the occurrence of
caustics. however, the boundary of the future (or past) of
the 2-surface b with respect to gab should be close to the
boundary of the future (respectively, past) of b with respect
to gab. thus, if one wishes to work with the exact metric
gab, one should presumably replace the null hypersurface, l,
in the bousso conjecture and our generalization (1.8) with a
suitable portion of the boundary of the future (or past) of b.
this new formulation of the conjectures should hold whenever
eq. (1.9) or eqs. (1.10) and (1.11) hold for the macroscopi-
cally averaged entropy current and macroscopically averaged
stress energy tensor. an alternative interpretative framework
would be to assume the existence of an entropy current
which varies rapidly on the smallest scales that are compati-
ble with our gradient assumption (1.11) [atomic and nuclear
scales in our example], in which case our result would apply
directly to the microscopic metric.

temperatures above a critical temperature of order the
planck temperature. one can also check that for quan-
tum elds in a box at low temperatures (the example dis-
cussed in sec. i a above), the condition (1.10) is violated
only if the box is planck size or smaller, or if the num-
ber of species is allowed to be very large. thus, it seems
plausible that the bound (1.10) will be universally valid
if one assumes a planck scale cuto for physics and if one
also assumes a limit to the number of species. the second
assumption (1.11) states roughly that the gradient of the
entropy density is bounded above by the energy density.
for a free, massless boson or fermion gas in local thermal
equilibrium, this condition reduces to the condition that
the temperature gradient, |t|, be small compared with
t 2, i.e., that the fractional change in t over a distance
1/t be smaller than unity. this condition must be sat-
ised in order for the notion of local thermal equilibrium
to make sense.

in addition, it would appear that condition (1.11) is
necessary for our entire phenomenological description of
entropy as represented by an 4-current sa to be valid. to
see this, consider the following illustrative example. con-
sider a wavepacket mode of a quantum eld, where the
wavelength is  and where the volume occupied by the
wavepacket is f 3 for some dimensionless factor f >
consider a state where this wavepacket mode is occu-
pied by n particles. such a system has a well dened
expected stress energy tensor h tabi, whose correspond-
ing energy density will be of order

 1.

n
f 4 .

 

(1.13)

we now imagine that we are to somehow model such a
system with a smooth entropy ux vector sa. we ex-
pect that the total entropy carried by the system should
be of order n , so that the entropy density s should be
approximately

n
f 3 .

s 

(1.14)

clearly the concept of local entropy ux here cannot
make sense on scales short compared to the wavelength
; only in an averaged sense, on scales comparable to 
or larger, does the concept of entropy ux make sense.
thus, the lengthscale l = s/|s| over which the entropy
density varies should be greater than or of the order of
. from the estimates (1.13) and (1.14), the condition
l >
  is equivalent to |s| <
 , which is essentially our
assumption (1.11). hence, our second condition (1.11)
rules out the class of entropy currents sa which vary sig-
nicantly over scales shorter than , allowing only the
more appropriate sa that vary over scales of a wavelength
or longer.

in summary, we expect our second set of hypotheses
to be valid in regimes where the following conditions are
satised: (i) the gravitational contributions to entropy,
other than that from black holes, are negligible. (ii) the

matter entropy can be accurately be described by an en-
tropy current sa.
in particular, this condition will be
valid in familiar hydrodynamic regimes. (iii) the vac-
uum energy contributions to the stress-energy tensor are
negligible, so that the stress-energy tensor satises clas-
sical energy conditions.

in regimes satisfying these three conditions, our hy-
potheses (1.10) and (1.11) should be valid, and hence
our arguments show that the our generalization (1.8) of
boussos entropy bound should hold. while our argu-
ments do not show that the entropy bound (1.8) holds
at any fundamental level, they do show than any coun-
terexample either must involve quantum phenomena in
an essential way, or must violate eq. (1.9) and eq. (1.10)
or eq. (1.11).

ii. derivation of generalized entropy

bound

in this section we derive the generalized entropy bound
(1.8) from the each of the two sets of assumptions (1.9)
and (1.10)(1.11).

we start with some denitions and constructions.
first, we can without loss of generality take the vector
eld ka on the 2-surface b to be future directed, since
the conjecture is time reversal invariant. let la be the
unique vector eld on b which is null, future directed,
orthogonal to b and which satises laka = 1. we ex-
tend both ka and la to l by parallel transport along the
null geodesic generators of l. thus, ka is tangent to each
geodesic. then the expansion  = aka is well dened
on l and independent of how ka is extended o of l,
since

 = (gab + kalb + kbla)akb.

(2.1)

by the hypotheses of boussos conjecture and of its gen-
eralization (1.8),  is nonpositive everywhere on l. let
{x} = (x1, x2) be any coordinate system on b. then
one obtains a natural coordinate system (, x1, x2) on l
in the obvious way, where ka = (d/d)a and we take
 = 0 on b.

for the generator  which starts at the point x on
b, let (x) be the value of ane parameter (possi-
bly  = ) at the endpoint of the generator. this
endpoint can either be a caustic ( = ) or have a
nite expansion . we can without loss of generality ex-
clude the case  = , since otherwise we must have
tabkakb = 0 along  by the focusing theorem, and then
either version of our hypotheses imply that sa = 0 along
, so that there is no contribution to the entropy ux.
thus, generators of innite ane parameter length make
no contribution to the lhs of the inequality (1.8) while
making a non-negative contribution to the rhs, and so
can be ignored. for the generators of nite ane param-
eter length, we can without loss of generality rescale the
ane parameter along each generator in order to make
the endpoint occur at  = 1.

a. reducing the conjecture to each null geodesic

generator

next, we show that it is sucient to focus attention
on each individual generator of l, one at a time. more
specically we have the following lemma.

lemma: a sucient condition for the generalized en-
tropy bound (1.8) is that for each null geodesic generator
 of l of nite ane parameter length, we have

d (saka)a()

where

a()  exp"z

d ()#

(2.2)

(2.3)

is an area-decrease factor associated with the given gen-
erator.

to prove the lemma, rst note that by assumption the

entropy ux through l is given by

sl =zl

saabcd,

(2.4)

where the orientation on the hypersurface l is that de-
termined by the 3-form

bcd  laabcd.

(2.5)

here we are using the notation of appendix b of ref.
[15] for integrals of dierential forms, and we also use
the abstract index notation of ref. [15] for all roman
indices throughout the paper. the formula (2.4) applies
for either version of our phenomenological description of
entropy, i.e., we can use either sa or sa
l in the integrand.
in appendix a we derive the following formula for the
integral (2.4) in the coordinate system (, x):

d2x pdet h(x) z (x)

sl =zb
here x  (x1, x2) = x, h(x) is the induced 2-metric
on the 2-surface b, (x) is the value of ane parameter
at the endpoint of the generator which starts at x, and

d s()a(). (2.6)

wherer 

b d2x denotes an integral only over those genera-
tors of nite ane parameter length. now we see that if
the condition (2.2) is satised, then we obtain from eq.
(2.8) that

sl

4z 

b

d2xpdet h(x) [1  a(1, x)] .

(2.9)

the generalized entropy bound (1.8) now follows from
eq. (2.9), using the fact that the area ab of the 2-surface
b is given by

ab =zb

d2xpdet h(x),

(2.10)

while the area ab  of the 2-surface b composed of the
endpoints of the generators is

ab  =z 

b

d2xpdet h(x)a(1, x).

(2.11)

b. preliminaries

from the lemma, its sucient now to prove the condi-
tion (2.2) for each nite-ane-parameter-length null gen-
erator  of l. for ease of notation we henceforth drop
the dependence on the x coordinates in all quantities.
now the twist along each of the null generators will van-
ish, since it is vanishing initially on the two surface b,
and the evolution equation for the twist [15] then implies
that it always vanishes. the raychaudhuri equation in
the relevant case of vanishing twist can thus be written
as

where f = 8tabkakb+ab ab and ab is the shear tensor.
the function f is non-negative by the null convergence
condition [which follows from either eq. (1.9) or eqs.
(1.10)(1.11)] since ab ab  0 always. the assumption
(1.9) of our rst set of hypotheses now implies that

|s()|  (1  )f ()/8.

(2.13)

similarly, our second set of hypotheses (1.10) and (1.11)
imply that

s  saka.

(2.7)

note that s is non-negative for future directed, timelike
or null sa, which we expect to be the case.
[however,
our proof does not require the assumptions that sa be
timelike or null and future directed.] now as discussed
above, s() = 0 for those generators of innite ane

is smaller than [1a(1)]/4, using only the denition (2.3)
of the area-decrease factor, the raychaudhuri equation
(2.12), and either eq. (2.13) or eqs. (2.14)  (2.15).

now by assumption any geodesic generator must ter-
minate no later than the point (if it exists) at which
a()  0. hence we have a()  0 everywhere on
l. it is convenient to dene g() =pa(), from which
it follows from the denition (2.3) of the area-decrease
factor and from the raychaudhuri equation (2.12) that

first, note that without loss of generality we can as-
sume that the function s() is nonnegative. this is be-
cause we can replace s() by |s()| in the integral (2.17)
without decreasing the value of the integral, and the as-
sumptions (2.14) and (2.15) are satised by the function
|s| if they are satised by s, since ||s| |  |s|.
we start by xing a 1 in (0, 1), the value of which
we will pick later. we then choose a 0 in [0, 1] which
minimizes f in the interval [0, 1], i.e., we choose a 0
which satises

f () = 2

g()
g()

.

(2.18)

f (0) = min

01

f ().

(2.24)

it follows that g
is negative. also the expansion 
is always negative, and hence g
is always negative,
so that g is monotonically decreasing, starting at the
value g(0) = 1, and ending at some value g(1) with
0  g(1)  1.
in particular, we have 0  g()  1
for all . for those generators which terminate at caus-
tics we have g(1) = a(1) = 0, but not all generators
will terminate at caustics; some might terminate at the
auxiliary spacelike 2-surface b.

c. proof under rst set of hypotheses

using the formulae (2.13) and the denition g = a

we nd that the integral (2.17) satises

i

8z 1

0

d (1  )f ()g()2.

(2.19)

from the formula (2.18) for f (), this can be written as

i  z 1

0

d (1  )g()g()/4.

(2.20)

now we have 0  g()  1, so we can drop the factor of
g() in the integrand of eq. (2.20). integrating by parts
and using the fundamental theorem of calculus now gives

[we assume that the function f () is continuous so that
this minimum is attained]. we now show that

f (0)

[1  a(1)]2 .

(2.25)

to see this, let 0() and a0() be the expansion and
area-decrease factor that would be obtained by solving
the raychaudhuri equation (2.12) with f () replaced by
f (0), and using the same initial condition 0(0) = (0).
since f ()  f (0) for 0    1, it is clear that we
must have

a()  a0()

(2.26)

for 0    1. but the explicit solution of the ray-
chaudhuri equation for 0() and a0() is

0() = p2f (0) tan"r f (0)

( + )#

(2.27)

and

a0() =

now

g(0)  g(1) = 1  g(1)  1  a(1),

(2.22)

since g(0) = 1 and g(1) = pa(1)  a(1). also the

third term in eq. (2.21) is negative. it follows that

i

[1  a(1)] ,

(2.23)

where  is a constant in [0, 1]. applying the inequality
(2.26) at  = 1 now yields

a(1)  a0(1)  cos2"r f (0)

2

1# .

(2.29)

the proof extends easily to the non-continuous case. if we
choose  > 0 and choose 0 so that

f (0) = (1 + ) g.l.b. {f ()| 0    1},

then we can come as close as we please to satisfying the in-
equality (2.54). hence the inequality (2.54) is satised.

7

using the inequality cos1()  (12)/2 which is valid
for 0    1, and the inequality a(1)  a(1), one can
obtain the upper bound (2.25) from eq. (2.29).
next, we split the integral (2.17) into a contribution i1
from the interval [0, 0] and a contribution i2 from the
interval [0, 1]:

i =z 0

0

sa +z 1

0

sa = i1 + i2.

(2.30)

in the formula for i1, we drop the factor of a which is
 1, insert a factor of 1 = d/d, and integrate by parts
to obtain

i1  i1b + i 
1.

(2.31)

here i1b is the boundary term that is generated, given
by

i1b = s(0)0,

(2.32)

and

i 

1 = z 0

0

d s().

(2.33)

similarly we insert a factor of 1 = d(  1)/d into the
formula for i2 and integrate by parts, which yields

i2 = i2b + i 
2,

where the boundary term is

i2b = s(0)a(0)(1  0),

and where

(2.34)

(2.35)

i 

2 =z 1

0

d [sa(1  ) + sa(1  )] .

(2.36)

an upper bound on the total integral is now given by the
relation

i  i1b + i2b + i 

1 + i 
2.

(2.37)

we now proceed to derive bounds on the integrals i 
and on the total boundary term i1b + i2b.

1, i 
2,

consider rst the total boundary term, which from

eqs. (2.32) and (2.35) is given by

i1b + i2b = s(0) [0 + (1  0)a(0)] .

(2.38)

since a(0) and 0 both lie in [0, 1], this is bounded
above by s(0). if we now use our assumption (2.14) we
nd

i1a + i1b p1 f (0),

and using the bound (2.25) on f (0) nally yields

i1a + i1b

turn now to the integral i

we now show that for all  in [0, 1],

(2.43)

(2.44)

to see this, apply the mean value theorem to the function
g over the interval [, 1], which yields

g(1)  g() = (1  )g(),

(2.45)

for some  in [, 1]. but since g is negative by eq.
(2.18) we have g()  g(), and it follows that

(2.48)

now since 0  g()  1 for all , we can drop the factor

and use the fundamental theorem of calculus we obtain

i 
2  2 2 [g(0)  g(1) + (1  0)g(0)] .

(2.49)

now since g(0)  1 and g = a we have
g(0)  g(1)  1  g(1)  1  a(1).

(2.50)

also, the last term in eq. (2.49) is negative. hence we
obtain the upper bound

i 
2  2 2 [1  a(1)] .

(2.51)

finally we combine eq. (2.37) with the upper bounds
(2.40), (2.47), and (2.51) for the boundary term i1b + i2b

and 2, of order unity, such the entropy bound (1.8) is
both satised and can be saturated by entropy currents
satisfying the inequalities (1.10) and (1.11). a similar
statement is true for the hypothesis (1.9).

in our analysis above, we have taken the dimension of
spacetime to be 4. however, in an n-dimensional space-
time with n > 2, the raychaudhuri equation continues to
take the form (2.12), except that the coecient of 2 on
the right side is now 1/(n 2). consequently, if we dene
g = a1/(n2) in the n-dimensional case, an equation of
the form (2.18) will continue to hold with the factor of 2
on the right side is replaced by (n  2). the remainder
of our analysis can then be carried out in direct parallel
with the 4-dimensional case. thus, with suitable adjust-
ments in the numerical factors appearing in eqs.(1.9),
(1.10), and (1.11), all of our results continue to hold in
any spacetime dimension greater than 2.

iii. conclusion

we have shown that the generalization (1.8) of
boussos entropy bound is satised under two dierent
sets of hypotheses, (1.9) and (1.10)  (1.11), constrain-
ing the entropy ux. while these hypotheses are un-
likely to represent relations in any fundamental theory,
they appear to be satised for matter in a certain semi-
classical regime below the planck scale. as such, our
results rule out a large class of possible counterexamples
to boussos conjecture, including cases involving gravita-
tional collapse or other strong gravitational interactions.
as with boussos bound, if the holographic principle is
indeed part of a fundamental theory, it may be that the
hypotheses discussed here will provide clues to its formu-
lation.

note that we do not show in this paper that the
entropy bound (1.8) bound can be saturated by en-
tropy 4-currents sa satisfying our assumptions. how-
ever, consideration of simple examples shows that this
bound comes within a factor of order unity of being sat-
urated by currents satisfying our second set of hypotheses
(1.10) and (1.11). also, a simple scaling argument shows
that the least upper bound on the ratio sl/(ab  ab  )
for currents satisfying our assumptions is of the form
2f (12
2 ) for some function f . as a result, at xed
12
the least upper bound depends continuously on

appendix a: formula for integral

over null hypersurface

in this appendix we derive the formula (2.6) for the

integral

sl =zl

saabcd

(a1)

of the entropy current over the null hypersurface l [cf.
eq. (2.4) above], using the coordinate system (, x) =
(, x1, x2) dened in sec. ii.

we start by discussing the relation between tensors
on the spacetime m and tensors on the null surface l.
we introduce the notation that capital roman indices
a, b, c, . . . denote tensors on l, in the sense of the ab-
stract index convention of ref. [15]. for any 1-form wa
dened on l, we will denote the pullback of wa to l as

wa = p a

awa;

(a2)

this denes the operator p a
the pullback of ka vanishes, so p a

a. since ka is normal to l,
aka = 0. using the null

tetrad introduced at the beginning of section ii, we can
dene a similar mapping between vectors on m and vec-
tors on l. at any point p in l, the projection operation
(a3)

b + lakb)vb

va  (a

maps the 4-dimensional tangent space tp(m ) into the
3-dimensional tangent space tp(l). thus can write the
a va, which denes the
mapping (a3) as va  va = qa
operator qa
a . note that the vector la is annihilated
by the projection operation (a3), while ka and vectors
perpendicular to ka and la are unchanged. we dene
ka = qa
a ka = (d/d)a, which is the tangent vector in l
the generators of l.

consider now the integrand in the integral (a1). it is

proportional to

sa k[albecfd],

(a4)

where ea and f a are spacelike vector elds such that
{ka, la, ea, f a} is an orthonormal basis. when we pull-
back the 3-form (a4) to l, all the terms where the index
on ka is free and not contracted with sa will be annihi-
lated. hence without loss of generality we can replace
sa with (sbkb)la. thus we obtain from eqs. (a1) and
(2.5) that

sl =zl

s abc,

(a5)

abc abc = 3!.

(a9)

[a denition is terms of raising indices is inapplicable
here since there is no natural non-degenerate metric on
l.] now contracting both sides of eq. (a8) with abc
and using eq. (a7) yields

 = daka = aka,
which is just the usual expansion .

(a10)

next, we dene a 3-form abc on l by demanding that
it coincide with abc on the 2-surface b, and that it be
lie transported along the generators of l. if we write
abc = abc , where  is a scalar eld on l, it follows
from eq. (a8) with  =  that

l~k = .

(a11)

solving this equation using the denition (2.3) of the
area-decrease factor yields  = a. thus we see that
the geometrical meaning of the factor a is that it is the
ratio between the lie-transported 3-volume form abc
and the parallel transported 3-volume form abc , where
in both cases one starts from the 2-surface b.

consider now the specic coordinate system (, x) =
(, x1, x2). in this coordinate system the fact that abc
is lie transported along the generators translates into




x1x2(, x) = 0,

(a12)

where s = saka and where the 3-form abc is dened in
eq. (2.5) above.
as a tool for evaluating the integral (a5), we dene an

so that

induced connection da on l by

davb = p c

a qb

d cvd

(a6)

where vd is any vector eld on m with va = qa
b vb. one
can check that this formula denes a derivative operator
on l. next we note that the pullback abc of the 3-form
(2.5) is parallel transported along each null generator of
l with respect to the connection (a6):

kada bcd = 0.

(a7)

this follows from the fact that ka, la and abcd are par-
allel transported along each generator with respect to
the 4-dimensional connection. next, consider the lie
derivative l~k of abc with respect to ka. since the
result is a 3-form we must have

(cid:0)l~k(cid:1)abc =  abc,

(a8)

for some scalar eld . we can dene a upper index
volume form abc by the requirement that

x1x2 (, x) = x1x2(0, x) =pdet h(x),

where x1x2 (, x) denotes one of the coordinate compo-
nents of the tensor abc in the coordinate system (, x),
x  (x1, x2) as before, and h is the induced 2-metric
on b. it follows that

(a13)

x1x2(, x) = a(, x)pdet h(x).

combining this with the formula (a5) for the entropy
ux nally yields the formula (2.6).
