abstract

we investigate one-matrix correlation functions for nite su (n ) yang-mills
integrals with and without supersymmetry. we propose novel convergence
conditions for these correlators which we determine from the one-loop per-
turbative eective action. these conditions are found to agree with non-
perturbative monte carlo calculations for various gauge groups and dimen-
sions. our results yield important insights into the eigenvalue distributions
() of these random matrix models. for the bosonic models, we nd that
the spectral densities () possess moments of all orders as n  .
in
the supersymmetric case, () is a wide distribution with an nindependent
asymptotic behavior ()  3, 7, 15 for dimensions d = 4, 6, 10, re-
spectively.

recently there has been renewed interest in dimensional reductions of su(n) yang-mills
theories. it has been argued that these toy models, apart from some subtleties, allow to
recover the full unreduced theories in the large n limit [1]. the supersymmetric reductions
are relevant to d-brane physics and have also been used in various attempts to dene non-
perturbative formulations of quantum gravity, supermembranes and superstrings. for the
complete reduction, all space-time dependence is eliminated from the gauge elds, and
the continuum yang-mills path integral becomes an ordinary multi-matrix integral. the
integrals appear to be ill-dened due to the at directions (i.e. commuting matrices) in the
action. recent calculations have however uncovered that in many cases of interest these
matrix integrals converge and thus do not need to be regulated. this was analytically found
in the supersymmetric case for su(2) in [2]. in [3], [4] we found by monte carlo methods
that the absolute convergence persists for larger values of n. furthermore, we numerically
established (and proved analytically for su(2)) the convergence properties of the bosonic
(non-supersymmetric) integrals. perturbative one-loop estimates in favor of convergence
were presented for the supersymmetric case in [5] and, recently, in [6], for the bosonic case.
mathematically rigorous proofs for n > 2 are however still missing. for some applications
of these integrals see e.g. [2], [7], [8], [9].

they correspond to fully reduced d-dimensional euclidean su(n) yang-mills theory. here
n is the number of real supersymmetries, and for n > 0 the only possible dimensions are
d = 3, 4, 6, 10 corresponding to n = 2, 4, 8, 16, respectively. if n = 0 (no supersymmetry),
a priori all d  2 are possible and we simply omit the terms with grassmann elds both
from the measure and action of eq.(1). for the detailed notation we refer to [3], [4].
in view of [2], [3], [4] the necessary and sucient conditions of existence for the integrals

eq.(1) then appear to be

as already mentioned in [4], it is only the bosonic d = 3 su(3) integral which escapes a clear-
cut classication by numerical means as we cannot exclude almost marginal convergence.
we have now checked that the susy d = 3 integral is not absolutely convergent1 for any n,
disproving a conjecture made in [4].

case and for d = 4, 6, 10 in the supersymmetric case.

for the large n limit, eq.(2) implies existence of the integrals for d  3 in the bosonic
analytic motivation of eq.(2) for general n can be obtained from the one-loop perturba-
tive calculations of the eective action as presented in [5], [6]: decompose the matrices into
diagonal d(x) (with matrix elements d(x)ij = ijxi
) and o-diagonal components y
(i.e. (y)ii = 0): x = d(x) + y. fix a background gauge, expand the action to quadratic
order in y and work out the eective action for the diagonal elements xi
. the result for
the supersymmetric case [5] reads

here the sum is over all possible maximal (i.e. there are n  1 links in g) trees g connecting
the n coordinates. as indicated in eq.(3), there are actually further terms present to one-
loop order for d = 6, 10, but they are irrelevant for the powercounting arguments below
(see [5]). for the bosonic case [6] one nds

the one-loop approximation is reasonable for well-separated diagonal components xi

integrals on hyperplanes of the integration space in eqs.(3),(4) results, at large xi
in the convergence conditions eq.(2).

it is now easily veried that supercial powercounting of all

clearly, this perturbative argument is not a proof of eq.(2): first, the cumulative eect
of all corrections to this one-loop eective action is beyond control. second, there are
potentially dangerous regions in the integration space where some of the dierences (xixj)2
are small (thus rendering the one-loop approximation invalid) while others are large (leading
to a potential divergence).

an analytic calculation of the d = 4, 6, 10 susy partition functions z n

n,d has been re-
ported in [10]. in this work, light-cone variables  = x1 + ixd,  = x1  ixd are used.
subsequently,  and  are treated as independent hermitian matrices (i.e. one actually has
 = x1  x0,  = x1 + x0), and the integrals computed in [10] correspond to eq.(1)
with minkowski (as opposed to euclidean) metric. however, the minkowski integrals are
divergent and need to be regulated. this calculation might be rendered rigorous if one suc-
ceeded in deriving the imposed pole prescriptions directly from the matrix wick rotation
xd  ix0.
for applications, it is important to understand the statistical eigenvalue distribution of
these random matrix models. the simplest quantity is the distribution for the eigenvalues
i of just one matrix, say, x1, in the background of the other matrices x2, . . . , xd

[3]. the integral is however not absolutely convergent, as we have checked numerically with the
methods used in this paper. this divergence is also present in the analytically tractable su (2)
case. adding a chern-simons term, as proposed in [10], does not improve convergence and the
d = 3 susy integral modied by such a term is divergent for all n .

in an ordinary hermitian matrix model, say with weight exp(tr x 2
falls o at innity as ()  exp(2). therefore all moments eq.(6) exist.
in the yang-mills ensembles for su(2), we obtained analytically (along the lines of [2])
that the correlators eq.(6) exist only for low values of k; we nd k < d  3 (n > 0) and
k < d
2  2 (n = 0). for general n, we obtain the convergence conditions in the one-
loop approximations eqs.(3),(4). some care has to be exercised, since the most divergent
contribution is not obtained by simply counting the overall dimensionality of the integral.
in fact, a more dangerous infrared conguration stems from only a single (say, the i-th)
eigenvalue xi
 becoming large in the d-dimensional space. the only exception being, once
again, the bosonic d = 3 su(3) integral. therefore, apart from this one case, we nd

this means that no moments exist for the d = 4 susy integral, and only the rst two and
six even moments for, respectively, the d = 6 and d = 10 susy integrals!

we have been able to directly verify our conjecture eq.(7) with the monte carlo approach
of [3], [4]. it may seem straightforward to obtain a direct numerical estimate of the eigenvalue
spectrum of x1 by generating ensembles of x = (x1, x2, . . . , xd) with the statistical weight

where pd,n (x) is the pfaan polynomial coming from the integration over the fermionic
degrees of freedom (cf [3], for the bosonic integrals, this term is simply dropped). the
eigenvalue spectrum of x can in principle be sampled and its histogram generated.
in
practice, it is however impossible to make rm predictions on the tails of the histogram, as
they comprise an exceedingly small number of samples. for this reason, we rather generate
markov chains of congurations x(t) with the statistical weight

2 one might attempt to compute such correlators within the powerful framework of [10]. the
natural candidate would be h 1
n tr ki (where  = x1 + ixd). unfortunately, these correlators
vanish for all k in the euclidean integral eq.(1) due to the so(2) symmetry in the (x1, xd) plane
(m. douglas, private communication).

this means in particular that we perform one independent run for every value of k. the
critical information on the convergence condition is contained in the autocorrelation function
of our markov-chain vector x(t)

x(t)  x(t  )

(10)

for a xed value of  (as in [4], we have compactied all the integrands). an absolutely
non-integrable singularity of the integrand corresponds to an innite statistical weight con-
centrated in a region of negligible extension. this simply means that the simulation should
get stuck, and the autocorrelation function approach 1. an integrable singularity is not
picked up by the present method.

we have computed the autocorrelation function for a large number of cases. among the
supersymmetric cases, we considered n  6 for d = 4, n  5 for d = 6 and n = 2, 3, 4 for
d = 10. all the analytically known results for su(2) were easily reproduced. convergence
of bosonic integrals was checked for n  9 and d = 3, 4, 6.
as an example, we show in fig. 1 the autocorrelation functions of typical runs for the
bosonic integrals with d = 3, n = 6 for k = 2, k = 3 and k = 4. the criterion eq.(7) leads
us to expect convergence for k = 2 and k = 3, as the smallest diverging power is kcrit = 3.5.
this behavior is clearly reproduced in fig. 1. notice that the almost divergent case k = 3
gets stuck for very long periods of monte-carlo time, whereas the the almost convergent
integral k = 4 settles to a unit value of f 

t only after a very long transient.

alternations between stuck and mixing behavior.

though we expect the integrals to behave dierently. our monte carlo procedure leaves
a margin of error which we estimate to be k  1/2. a similar ambiguity aects the
abovementioned bosonic integral for d = 3 and n = 3.
the conditions eqs.(7) mean that in the yang-mills case the asymptotic behavior of the

one-matrix eigenvalue distribution eq.(5) decays algebraically:

most strikingly, the decay of the densities in the susy cases d = 4, 6, 10 (() 
3, 7, 15) is independent of n.
it means that the eigenvalue distribution are wide
even in the n   limit! this is a most unusual eect for a random matrix model. ev-
idently, supersymmetry is responsible for this behavior, as can e.g. be seen by comparing
the one-loop eective actions for the diagonal matrix elements in the susy (cf eq.(3)) and
non-susy (cf eq.(4)) case: in the latter, this eective action is o(n 2) while in the former it
is o(n).
the bosonic case is much more conventional in that the density becomes concentrated
in a nite interval at large n. in this context it is interesting to mention the result of a
numerical study of the bosonic yang-mills integrals which is complementary to the present
work:
4 x a
k = 1) with n. they nd that, if the variables in eq.(1) are rescaled as x a

such that an explicit factor of n appears in front of the action, this correlator tends to a
constant as n  . in consequence, the usual t hooft scaling of large n matrix models
is obeyed, and the edge of the eigenvalue support tends to a constant. nevertheless, the
observed asymptotic behavior (()  2n (d2) as n  ) is dierent from the universal
exponential decay law of wigner-type random systems.

to summarize, we have demonstrated how statistical information on the eigenvalue dis-
tributions of yang-mills integrals (which are the simplest examples for the so-called new
matrix models) can be obtained. we observed an interesting dierence in the tails of the
spectral distribution between the susy and non-susy ensembles. while suggestive  e.g. we
nd it interesting that the susy eigenvalue distribution tends to stretch out much farther
 the present study clearly does not yet address such important issues as the full nonper-
turbative eective action for the diagonal elements of all d matrices or the problem of
level spacing statistics. these questions will need to be addressed if one intends to apply
yang-mills integrals to string theory and large n gauge theory.
