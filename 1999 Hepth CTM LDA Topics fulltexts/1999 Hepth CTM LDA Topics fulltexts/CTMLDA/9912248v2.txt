abstract

in the t hooft-veltman dimensional regularization scheme it is
necessary to introduce nite counterterms to satisfy chiral ward
identities.
it is a non-trivial task to evaluate these counterterms
even at two loops.

we suggest the use of wilsonian exact renormalization group tech-
niques to reduce the computation of these counterterms to simple
master integrals.

we illustrate this method by a detailed study of a generic yukawa
model with massless fermions at two loops.

introduction

the dimensional regularization scheme devised by t hooft and veltman [1, 2]
and later systematized by breitenlohner and maison [3] (bmhv) is the only
dimensional regularization scheme which is known to be consistent in presence
of 5. it gives the correct result for the axial anomaly, at the price of breaking
d-dimensional lorentz symmetry and chiral symmetry; while the former is easily
recovered, it is a non-trivial task to satisfy the chiral ward identities.

more popular is the naive dimensional regularization scheme (ndr) [4]
which, although inconsistent, is much easier to use and can be handled safely
in most practical situations. for a review on the subject, see e.g. [5] .

due to the relevance of higher loop computations in the standard model,
where it is dicult to guarantee the consistency of the naive scheme, it is worth-
while to investigate thoroughly consistent renormalization schemes.

the diculties encountered in computing systematically in the bmhv sche-

me the non-invariant counterterms can be divided in three categories:

i) it is a complicated (but generally solvable) algebraic problem to satisfy all
the ward identities (modulo anomaly problems), determining these countert-
erms as combinations of feynman integrals;

ii) it is an analytically dicult problem to evaluate these counterterms, which
in general involve feynman integrals with several masses and/or momenta; ex-
plicit formulae with several masses at more than one loop usually range from
being quite complicated (see e.g. [6]) to being as yet unknown;

iii) it is burdensome to store these counterterms (which include evanescent
ones) and to compute the renormalization group beta function using them [7].
by comparison, we recall that in a vectorial theory (or in ndr, whenever
possible) step (i) is trivial in the minimal subtraction (ms) scheme, since the
ward identities are automatically satised; step (ii) is much simpler, since the
poles are much easier to compute than the nite parts of the green functions;
step (iii) is almost trivial, since in general multiplicative renormalization holds;
simple formulae for the beta and gamma renormalization group functions are
available in the ms scheme [2].

the short-cuts used to get the appropriate answer for the problem at hand

include:

i) in a few cases, like in the case of an axial current insertion in a vectorial
gauge theory, it is sucient to equate the axial vertex to the corresponding
vector vertex multiplied by 5 to be sure that the chiral ward identities are
satised [8];

ii) after solving the algebraic problem, avoid carrying out step (ii); this is
the philosophy of algebraic renormalization ( for a review see [9]), used generally
only for demonstrative purposes, but which can also be used for making explicit
computations, as shown in some two-loop examples carried out recently [10].

to our knowledge the only paper in which the counterterms are determined
systematically at one loop in the bmhv scheme in a chiral gauge theory is [11],
in which the bonneau-zimmermann [12] identities are used.

there are several computations of one-loop counterterms in the bmhv
scheme for particular processes in the standard model [13], but no systema-
tic one-loop treatment has been given in such a scheme.

in this paper we describe a general method for simplifying step (ii) and partly
(iii), i.e. we show that the counterterms can be reduced to zero-momentum

1

feynman integrals with the same auxiliary mass in all propagators, and that
the beta function can be computed easily without making a direct use of the
counterterms.

the auxiliary mass technique in this form has been used in the past at two
or more loops [14, 15, 16] in conjunction with ms. being the ms scheme mass-
independent [17], the auxiliary mass technique gives gauge-breaking terms that
are polynomial in the auxiliary mass and then can be easily treated; however in
chiral theories with bmhv the ms scheme cannot be used, and it is not easy
to disentangle the gauge-breaking terms.

we will show how to do this by wilsonian methods [18].
wilsonian methods have been used by polchinski [19] to simplify the proof of
renormalizability in 4; this proof has been further simplied and generalized to
other cases [20, 21, 22, 23]; in particular gauge theories have been renormalized
using the eective ward identities introduced in [20]. in [23] mass-independent
renormalization has been studied with these wilsonian methods; it has been
also shown in this paper that the wilsonian eective action satises an eective
renormalization group equation, which is the analogous of the eective ward
identities.

in this paper we propose the exploitation in the bmhv scheme of the eec-
tive ward identities and eective renormalization group equation to compute
the nite counterterms and the beta function in terms of wilsonian green func-
tions at zero momenta and masses, which are easy to evaluate.

as a simple testing ground for our proposal we renormalize systematically
at two loops the most general yukawa theory with massless dirac fermions;
so far only the simplest yukawa model with pseudoscalar coupling (without
chiral symmetry) has been renormalized at two loops in the minimal bmhv
subtraction scheme [7].

we impose wilsonian mass-independent renormalization conditions compat-
ible with the rigid chiral ward identities. our renormalization scheme is chosen
to coincide with the minimal subtraction scheme in the non-chiral yukawa case
(this choice is done to simplify step (i), but is not essential in our method); in
the general case it gives the same two-loop  and  functions as in the minimal
naive scheme [24].

finally we discuss the coupling with external gauge elds; we impose wilso-
nian renormalization conditions compatible with the eective ward identities
at one loop. at two loop we check only the gauge two-point function ward
identity and the adler-bardeen non-renormalization theorem [25].

our method is based on the use of a wilsonian ow belonging to the class
characterized by the cut-o functions k (n)
x+2 )n with n = 2, 3, . . . ;
these cut-o functions separate the propagators into hard and soft parts. for
n  2 the counterterms chosen at a particular  renormalize the ow for any .
we renormalize the theory at zero momenta and masses along the ow n = 2,
using the n = 3 case as a check on computations.

 (x) = ( 2

the counterterms are zero-momentum integrals with the same  in all the
propagators, which can be reduced to a single master integral at two loops
using recursion relations (for a review see [15]). we have used mathematica [26]
to evaluate these integrals.

in the rst section we show how the exact renormalization group method
can be used in connection with dimensional renormalization to renormalize the

2

yukawa models.

in the second section, after reviewing the recursion formula for the massive
zero-momentum two-loop integrals, we give the one and two loops results for
the yukawa models.

in the third section we discuss the eective ward identities for the yukawa

model in presence of external gauge elds.

we end with a concluding section.
in the appendix we give the complete two-loop bare yukawa action.

1 dimensional renormalization and the wilso-

nian eective action

1.1 t hooftveltman regularization scheme

we recall how gamma matrices are treated in the t hooft and veltman [1]
dimensional regularization scheme as elaborated by breitenlohner and maison
[3] (bmhv).

we work in euclidean space;  is the kronecker delta in d = 4   dimen-

sions;

 p = p ;  = d

the gamma matrices  satisfy the relation

where

{, } = 2i

tri = 4 ; i = i = 

(1)

(2)

(3)

in the bmhv scheme o(d) invariance is broken and one introduces o(4) 
o(d  4) invariant tensors : the (d  4)dimensional kronecker delta  and
the 4dimensional antisymmetric tensor  , satisfying

  =  ;  =  ;   = 0

moreover one denes the evanescent tensors

the matrix 5 is dened by

p   p ;    

satisfying

5 = i

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

in euclidean space the reection symmetry takes the place of hermiticity.

reection symmetry is an antilinear involution, under which

 =  ; (x) = (x)1 ;  (x) = 1(x)

(8)

3

where x

1 = x1, x

 = x for  6= 1.

for a multiplet of fermionic elds, a general local marginal fermionic bilinear,
involving a scalar (a), pseudoscalar (b), vector (v) and pseudovector (a), all
of them real elds, can be written as

z (h1 + h2[, 5] + h3 + ih45) +
z (ih5a + h65b + ih7v + ih8[, 5]a +

ih9v + h105a)

(9)

where hi are matrices over avour indices. reection invariance requires that
hi are hermitian.

greens functions in d dimensions are obtained performing the dirac algebra
in the feynman graphs with the above rules. actually the analytic continuation
to continuous dimensions is dened on the scalar coecients of the greens
functions expanded on a basis for tensorial structures. for chiral theories, being
o(d) broken, such a basis includes also hatted tensors.

the poles of the greens functions for   0 are removed by local countert-
erms. loop by loop the singular part of the counterterms must subtract exactly
the pole part of the greens functions, including the hatted components; the
nite parts of the counterterms instead are not uniquely determined by the
renormalization conditions which constrain only their 4dimensional part. in
fact the d  4 prescription requires, besides to take the limit   0, to set the
hatted tensors to zero.
in order to x completely the fermionic counterterms, in the decomposition
(9) we will choose that h3, h4, h9, h10 have vanishing nite term in their
laurent expansion. the same convention is assumed for the coecients bij, da
ij
and dab

ij in the bilinear scalar counterterms, which have the form

the constants c, ci are matrix-valued, c = cij , etc., where i,j are the internal
indices of the fermions i . the matrices si, pi are hermitian.

we will consider a group g which is not necessarily semi-simple, with struc-
ture constants f abc. the elds transform under linear (chiral) representations
of the group which are in general reducible:

  g ;

  g1 ; i  hijj

the yukawa coupling yii is invariant under these transformations pro-

(17)

(18)

the tree-level action is invariant under these chiral transformations, apart
from an evanescent fermionic kinetic term. higher corrections in the bare ac-
tion will require also non-invariant counterterms; in the next subsection we will
discuss how wilsonian methods can be applied to determine the counterterms
in order to preserve the ward identities.

1.3 wilsonian eective action

the bare action (11) has the form

s() =

1
2

d1 + si ()

(19)

where we use a compact notation in which  is a collection of elds. si contains
the tree-level interaction terms and the counterterms.

consider an analytic cut-o function

k(p, m ) = (

2

p2 + m 2 + 2 )n

(20)

for n  2 ; m 2 = m2  0 in the scalar sector; m 2 = 0 in the fermionic sector.
let us split the propagator in two parts characterized by a scale  > 0;
dening

dh = d = d(1  k) ; ds = dk

(21)

5

let us make an incomplete integration over the hard modes

z[j] = exp

1
h

w[j]  z de 1

h [s()j]

with bare action

s() =

1
2

d1

  + si ()

(22)

(23)

the green functions obtained from z[j] are infrared nite for  > 0 even at
exceptional momenta.

the ow of this functional from  to zero can be represented as

z[j] = z0[j] = e

h
2



j d1

 k



j z[j]

(24)

the wilsonian theory at scale  has a bare action diering from the one of

the usual theory at  = 0 by the term

s()  s() =

1
2

d1

 k

(25)

which has ultraviolet dimension less or equal to zero, due to the above made
choice of the cut-o function k; the renormalization of the usual theory implies
the renormalization of the wilsonian theory and viceversa.

to impose the renormalization conditions it is useful to separate the wilso-
nian 1-pi functional generator, obtained by making a legendre transformation
on w[j], into the quadratic tree-level and interacting parts:

[] =

1
2

d1

  + i

[]

(26)

and to make a taylor expansion of i
[] in elds, d-dimensional momenta and
masses; the four-dimensional terms in this expansion form a local functional,
which will be called sw .

let us now discuss briey why the renormalization program can be per-

formed on the z functional with some advantages:

i) since the hard propagator dh(p) is regular at p = 0 there are no infrared
problems in the evaluation of the counterterms, so that the counterterms can
be chosen to be feynman integrals at zero momenta and masses using a mass-
independent wilsonian renormalization scheme [23];

ii) for a wilsonian ow with n  2 it is simple to prove that the renormaliza-
tion at a xed  implies the niteness of the wilsonian eective action at every
value  of the wilsonian ow, in particular at  = 0; moreover because the
propagators d at  = 0 do not depend on n, a bare action that renormalizes
a given ow will also make nite the ows for every n  2.
iii) for a wilsonian ow with n  2 the ward identities and the renormaliza-
tion group equation on the functional z=0 are equivalent to the corresponding
eective ward identities [20, 22] and eective renormalization group equation
[23] on z, so that choosing renormalization conditions compatible with the
eective ward identities the validity of the ward identities on z=0 follows;
furthermore the renormalization group beta function can be expressed in terms
of feynman integrals at zero momenta and masses.

6

these considerations hold for any renormalizable theory in four dimensions;
we consider here only the yukawa model, which is the simplest chiral theory.
actually its rigid ward identities are too simple to illustrate point (iii), since z
satises the same rigid ward identities; however introducing external currents
one has to study the local ward identities, whose eective form will be used in
a later section.

in the yukawa model the bare constants in the action are chosen of the form

dc(l)

hln l

a ()

ca = xl1
nd = (4)/22(1 +


2

) ; c(l)

a () = xr0

c(l)
a,rr

(27)

we use a modied subtraction scheme [27] , in which nd is introduced in
ln(4) and 2 factors. we choose a mass-independent
order to avoid e ,
renormalization scheme, i.e. all the bare terms, apart from cij, are independent
from m2; the latter term depends polynomially on it.

the bare constants must be xed by suitable renormalization conditions on

the wilsonian eective action.

in the yukawa model the marginal part 2 s

w of the wilsonian eective

action is dened according to:

(30)

2in a wilsonian mass-independent scheme, as discussed in [23], the renormalization of the
mass parameter is treated in a way very similar to the kinetic term and therefore is included
in the marginal part of the action.

7

taking s derivatives with respect to  in (29) one has still a nite expression

for   0, so that one obtains the consistency conditions

l

rs g(r,lr)

a,n = 0

xr=1
for n = 2, ..., l and s = 1, ..., n  1.
for the two-loop case the consistency condition (31) for n = 2 and s = 1 is
known to hold for each feynman graph and its counterdiagrams [28], providing
a useful check.

(31)

to renormalize the theory we assign nite values to the constants ga at

 = 

ga = ra + o()

(32)

each coecient in the laurent expansion in  must be determined to estab-
lish completely the renormalization scheme. in a subtraction scheme in which
the bare constants are xed to have all positive powers of  equal to zero (see
eq. (27)) and the renormalized quantities are xed to be non singular and with
determined 0 coecient, the renormalization scheme is completely xed. the
o() term in eq. (32) refers to the fact that one cannot x the positive powers
of  both in the renormalization condition and in the bare action.

in order to respect the rigid ward identities one must choose for ra group-
covariant quantities under the chiral transformations. they can be constructed
out of the tree coupling constants y and hijkl, taking into account the invariance
properties

g1yig = hijyj

; g1y

i g = hijy

j

(33)

furthermore one can examine which choice for ra gives the simplest expression
for the counterterms.

for the non-chiral theory, in which the couplings pi of eq.(13) are vanishing
and g = g = gs, the simplest counterterms are those determined by the ms
scheme, corresponding to renormalization conditions ra(s) that can be explic-
itly computed.

for the chiral theory we will dene the counterterms as suitable functions
ca(s, p ) which, for p = 0, coincide with the corresponding functions of the non
chiral case. to this aim loop by loop we will choose ra applying a covarianti-
zation formula to the corresponding ra(s). a comparison of eq.(33) with the
analogous equation in the non chiral case with the same group g:

suggests the recipe for the greens functions of interest :

g1
s si gs = hijsj

where t r denotes the trace over the internal fermionic indices.

as an example let us consider the renormalization condition to be imposed
on the fermionic selfenergy. in the non chiral theory, using the minimal sub-
traction one computes:

(p)|marg = i/p r(s)

(36)

using the covariantization procedure i/p r(s) must be replaced by i/p r(y, y). in
order to be compared with the standard form of eq.(9)  can be written as

(p)|marg =

i

2 n/p(cid:2)r(y, y ) + r(y , y )(cid:3) +

1
2

[/p, 5](cid:2)r(y, y )  r(y , y )(cid:3)o

(37)

which diers from i/p r(y, y) by evanescent terms. eq.(37) gives the renormal-
ization condition for the chiral theory. observe that, if the theory is reection
symmetric, r(y, y) is hermitian.

the counterterms ca are completely determined by the pole part and by the
constant part of the corresponding vertices. they can be decomposed into two
parts

ca = cn dr

a

+ ca

(38)

where cn dr
has the same group structure as ra and, due to the choice of
renormalization conditions, has only pole part in  (see comment after eq.(32)).

a

the remaining part ca vanishes in the non-chiral case (pi = 0).
the non-marginal relevant terms satisfy

=0

ij

|p=m=0 = 0 ; =0

ij |p=m=0 = 0

(39)

in dimensional regularization, being the massless tadpoles equal to zero,

eq.(39) corresponds to have vanishing bare relevant counterterms.

2 explicit computations

2.1 master integrals

using the cut-o function (20) the hard propagator has the form

d(p, m ) = d(p, m )

p2 + m 2

xr=1

2

(p2 + m 2 + 2(cid:19)r

(cid:18)

(40)

the counterterms are computed in terms of wilsonian green functions at zero
momenta and masses m = 0; the corresponding wilsonian feynman graphs

with i internal lines have i sums pn

r1=1 ...pn

since d(p, m )(p2 +m 2) is polynomial in p the counterterms are expressed in
terms of massive zero momentum tensor integrals, in which all the propagators
have mass . taking traces one can reduce these tensor integrals in terms of
scalar integrals.

(43)

at higher loops an exact expression for these integrals is not known; they
can be reduced, using recursion relations, to a small number of master integrals
which can be expanded in ; to renormalize at l-loop one must know the i (l)
up to the o(1) term, the i (l1) up to the o() term and so on (in minimal
subtraction it is sucient to know the i (l) up to the o(1/) term, the i (l1) up
to the o(1) term and so on; however in presence of chiral symmetries ms is not
sucient).

at two loops there is only one master integral (for a review see e.g. [15]); it
is known how to compute the nite parts of the three-loop master integral [16].
in this paper we will restrict to two-loop computations; the recursion relation

is obtained from the identity

2bia,b+1,c + cia,b,c+1 = 0

(44)

(45)

from this relation and the fact that ia,b,c is totally symmetric in its indices it
follows the recursion relation

3 a ia+1,b,c = c (ia1,b,c+1  ia,b1,c+1) +

b (ia1,b+1,c  ia,b+1,c1) + (3a  d)ia,b,c

(46)

using this recursion relation one can express all ia,b,c , for a, b, c > 0 in terms
of the master integral i1,1,1 and in terms of ia,b,c, with one of the indices
vanishing; in the latter case the two-loop integral reduces to the product of two
one-loop integrals:

ia,b,0 = iaib

in [7] ms is applied in bmhv in the simplest yukawa model with a pseu-
doscalar, where there is no chiral symmetry to be maintained. here we intro-
duced nite counterterms, which are exactly those needed to obtain the same
renormalized green functions as in the ms ndr scheme. in [7] it was shown
that the beta function at two loop in the ms bmhv scheme diers from the
one in ms ndr scheme by a renormalization group transformation involving
nite one-loop counterterms, which are in agreement with eq.(51).

the coecients in eqs.(52), (53), (54), (55) and the corresponding ones for
the two-loop cn dr
in the case of the wilsonian ow n = 2 are given respectively
in the tables 2, 3, 4, 5. figures 2, 3, 4, 5 show the graphs contributing to these
coecients; for each diagram shown there are in general corresponding graphs
with one-loop counterterms that are not represented.

a

the naive part cn dr

of the two-loop bare constants agree with [24]. in order
to make the comparison with [24], where a two-component spinor formalism

a

is used, one must substitute the traces k t rhyi1 y 

i2 ...yi2n1 y 

i2ni in [24] with

yi1i2...i2n1i2n .

the remaining part of the bare counterterms is given in the appendix.
with the bare action determined using the ow n = 2, according to the
lines of sect.(1.3) one can dene a new wilsonian action (n=3)
. for n = 3
(or bigger) the new eective action is nite and satises the ward identities.
the graphs of (n=3)
now have n = 3 propagators d but contain the n =
2 counterterms. this suggests the following consistency check: consider the
contributions of n = 3 bare (marginal) graph, of its relative countergraph and
two loop counterterm; we have veried that although the two rst quantities
are divergent and separately not invariant, the total sum is nite and invariant.
furthermore this total sum, being computed on a dierent ow is dierent from
the n = 2 case.





2.4 renormalization group equation

let us compute the renormalization group beta and gamma functions in the
bmhv scheme at two loops. in the case of the simplest yukawa model this
has been done in [7] using the minimal subtraction formulas [2] and taking into
account the one-loop evanescent tensors in the bare action; after obtaining a
renormalization group equation involving also insertions of evanescent tensors,
these are solved in terms of relevant couplings obtaining the usual renormaliza-
tion group equation.

to avoid making a similar subtle analysis of the bare couplings in our case, we
will obtain the beta and gamma functions working directly with the wilsonian
eective action, which satises the eective renormalization group equation [23].
we will restrict to the massless case; in [23] it is considered also the massive
case.

in the compact notation of subsection 1.3 the gell-mann and low renormal-

ization group equation reads

(




+  


g

+ jt



j

)z[j] = e[j]

(56)

where z is the renormalized functional in which the limit   0 has not yet been
taken; e is an evanescent functional, which in general is not vanishing for nite
value of  since the renormalization of the theory is not strictly multiplicative,
and


g

 

= ijkl



hijkl

+ t r(yi


yi

+ 
yi



y 
i

)

(57)

from eq.(24) it follows that z[j] satises the eective renormalization

the eective renormalization group equation can be written as

(

)|=0)[, ] = e[]

or equivalently

(

)[] = t

2k(p)s1

h (p)ij
h (p)

(63)

between two bosonic or fermionic lines; due to its nonlocality [] does not
require renormalization.

let us nally rewrite in a suitable way the gradient terms in (62); using (30)

one gets

g(1)
a




= g(1,0)

a,1 = c(1)

a,1 ; 

g(2)
a


= 2g(2,0)

a,1 + g(1,1)

a,1

(64)

these gradients have the same group structure as the renormalization constants
given in eqs.(49), (52); the coecients of these group structures are given in
the tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the case of the n = 2 ow. observe that, while
a,1 and g(1,1)
g(2,0)
a,1 are not separately chiral group-covariant, the gradient term
a,1 + g(1,1)
2g(2,0)
a,1 must be covariant. this provides a check on the computations,
besides the double pole rule mentioned after (31), that we made in a systematic
way.

at one loop the wilsonian gradients can be expressed in terms of the pole of
the bare couplings, so that the formulae for the beta and gamma functions are
a and dening

equivalent to the standard formulae [2]; using a = p hl

3 external currents and local ward identities

3.1 external currents

in order to dene the currents associated to the symmetry transformations (14)
we will add in the action (11) an external gauge eld aa
.

at tree level the action is now

s(0) = z d +

where

d = ( + iaa

ta) ; di = (ij + iaa

a

ij)j

(68)

we can choose for the external gauge eld the condition aa

 = 0, so that
ta is equivalent to ta and the fermionic gauge coupling ita is equal to the
reection-symmetric expression i

2 (ta + ta).

we set the  factors to one; they can be easily reintroduced by dimensional

analysis.

the local innitesimal version of transformations (14) is now

 = a  f abcac

aa
 = iata ;   = ia ta
i = iaa

ijj

 b
b = dab

(69)

where a = 0. the tree-level action is invariant under these transformations
apart from an evanescent fermionic kinetic term.

to renormalize arbitrary products of currents we will consider in the bare

action local monomials in aa

 up to fourth order.

the bare action (11) gets additional terms:

s(a) = z 1

(70)

the marginal part sw of the wilsonian eective action will have a similar

dependence on aa
.

the renormalization conditions on sw analogous to (32), which include the
new vertices, have to be chosen in such a way that the local chiral ward identities
hold; to this aim the renormalization conditions are xed compatibly with the
eective ward identities. these identities have been introduced in [20] and
further studied in [22].

an analysis similar to the one in sect.2.4 shows that the extra term of the
eective ward identity can be represented as the insertion of non-local vertices.
under transformation (69) one gets:

 = t  + o

;

t  = (cid:20)(cid:18) 1

2

d1

 k(cid:19)(cid:21)  

(71)

where t  is the generator of the 1-pi green functions with one insertion of the
operator (cid:0) 1

 k(cid:1) . its feynman rules are

(72)

2 d1
 ia(p)[s1

h (p + q)k(p + q)ta  tas1

h (q)k(q)]

for insertion on the fermionic lines and

 ia(p)[d1

h (p + q)k(p + q)a  ad1

h (q)k(q)]

(73)

for insertion on the scalar lines.

if one can choose the renormalization conditions on  such that o is
evanescent, the eective ward identities are not anomalous and the usual ward

19

identities are recovered at  = 0; otherwise it is anyway possible to separate
the functional o in a part corresponding to the local anomaly operator plus a
part representing an evanescent operator:

o = a + e 

(74)

equation (71) is the eective ward identity [20, 22], cast in a form which we
nd convenient for explicit computations.

the anomaly operator is dened by its renormalization conditions at the
renormalization scale  =  therefore we have to consider the marginal projec-
tion of eq.(71) in the limit   0:

sw = t + a

(75)

where t and a are the marginal parts of t  and a.
the additional renormalization conditions to which we refer in the following
sections, have been chosen through a covariantization procedure of the renormal-
ization conditions of the corresponding vector theory with minimal subtraction.
for example to the tensor t r[ta
ssj] we associate in the chiral theory the ten-
tbyj], which has the same transformation property. according to
sor 1
this rule by construction sw does not contain monomials in the gauge elds
with the levi-civita tensor. this leads to the denition of the anomaly in the
left-right symmetric form.

the bardeen anomaly can be obtained through dierent renormalization

condition, allowing in sw terms proportional to the levi-civita tensor.

3.3 bardeen anomaly

(84)

(85)

(86)

(87)

the theory we considered up to now is very general, so for instance one should be
able to compute the bardeen anomaly [31]. this requires a suitable modication
of the non naive counterterm part s(a). lets consider the case in which
g = gr gl. in our model this is made by choosing that half of the generators
ta
r and half of the generators ta
r = 0.
lets consider moreover the case in which the left and the right representations
of g are the same so that the vectorial representation of g turns out to be
dened.

l vanish in such a way that ta

l = ta

rtb

ltb

decompose the gauge parameter as

  itaa =  + 5

(88)

now v and a as well as  and , which are respectively the vectorial and
axial gauge parameters, can be considered as independent quantities. the gauge
transformation

a =  + [, a]

22

(89)

decomposes into vectorial and axial gauge transformations.

under vectorial gauge transformations one has

v = dv

  ;

a = [,a]

and the scalar elds introduced in eq.(86) transform homogeneously.

under axial gauge transformations one has

a = dv
 
under a vectorial gauge transformation one gets

v = [,a]

;

sbare = a()

(90)

(91)

(92)

where a() is the vectorial part of the anomaly (77) which indeed can be de-
composed as

a = a() + a()

where

a() =

one can then modify the renormalization of the product of the currents by
subtracting out all the terms depending on the levi-civita tensor in the nite
part of the bare action (87) and correspondingly by introducing their gauge
variation in eq.(75). being t unchanged the eect of subtracting eq.(92) is
to recover the vectorial gauge invariance, the subtraction of eq.(95) put the
anomaly in the bardeen form [31].

observe that the -dependent part of (87) is not specic of the bmhv reg-

ularization, being xed its gauge variations (92, 95).

the -independent part of (87) is specic of the bmhv regularization; for
instance it takes a dierent expression in [32], where a dierent renormalization
(tr + tl) and a = i
scheme is used. using (87) with v = i
2 aa
(tr  tl)
and making the non-minimal choice zab = 5
3 s2(f )ab we nd agreement with the
nite counterterm computed in [11] using the bonneau identities [12] .

at two loops similar computations could be performed. we have computed the
marginal wilsonian action in the two gauge eld sector, that is the coecients

we used the notation of eqs.(84,85); the r.h.s. of eq.(98) is not simply
quadratic in the gauge elds because we completed it in order to have an ex-
pression gauge-invariant under vectorial transformation. this fact has been
possible because the derivatives v of the gauge elds v appear only in
the combination [v] as expected, since dimensional regularization and ours
renormalization condition respect vectorial symmetry.
we checked the non renormalization theorem of the anomaly only in the
two-gluon sector of eq. (75). we have computed the part of t from which the
anomaly might arise:

t = z a(x) ab

ac

tabc

(99)

where tabc is an invariant tensor symmetric in the last two indices. the non
renormalization theorem requires that the completely symmetric part t(abc),
which cannot be eliminated by a local counterterm, must vanish.

fig. 9 shows the graphs which give contributions to t(abc). each contribution
is decomposed on a suitable basis of symmetric tensor, we have chosen a basis
in which a
ij never appears explicitly (symmetrization in the indices a, b, c is
understood):

t (1)
abc = t r[y 
t (2)
abc = t r[y

k ta
ry 
r]  t r[ykta

ltb
k tb

ltc
l]
ltc
l]

(100)

the results of our calculations are summarized in table 8: as expected the
sum of the contributions of every column vanishes, so that the adler-bardeen
theorem is veried.

one could address the question whether tabc and not only its symmetric
part is actually vanishing. for g = su (n ), using the young tableaux one can
easily prove that invariant tensors xabc with mixed symmetry do not exist; 3
for more general groups see [33].

3we thank c. destri for explaining this point to us.

4 concluding remarks

we have shown that wilsonian methods are useful in the bmhv dimensional
renormalization of theories with chiral symmetries; the two-loop renormalization
of the most general yukawa theory becomes straightforward in this scheme,
while in a more conventional approach, based on the verication of usual ward
identities, it is a non trivial task.

in our approach one renormalizes the eective wilsonian action along a
ow on which the subtraction integrals are easily computed using standard
techniques.

there is some arbitrariness in the choice of this ow; we worked with the
n = 2 ow, which is the simplest one from a computational viewpoint:
it is
quite obvious that calculations with the n  3 ows are more complicated,
although the bare action is the same. on the other hand the n = 1 ow, which
coincides with the auxiliary mass method, does not respect renormalizability so
the procedure described in this paper fails down. it is a convenient method in
nonchiral theories where minimal subtraction respects the ward identities.
in the future we intend to apply our formalism to chiral gauge theories.

we have written the naive part of the counterterms in the tables; here we report
the remaining counterterms, necessary to recover the rigid chiral symmetry in
the bmhv scheme.
