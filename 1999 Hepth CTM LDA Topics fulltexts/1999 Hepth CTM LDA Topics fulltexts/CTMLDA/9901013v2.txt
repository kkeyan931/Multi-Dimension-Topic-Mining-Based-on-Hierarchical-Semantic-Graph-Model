abstract

the nelson stochastic mechanics is derived as a consequence of the basic physi-
cal principles such as the principle of relativity of observations and the invariance of
the action quantum. the unitary group of quantum mechanics is represented as the
transformations of the systems of perturbing devices. it is argued that the physical
spacetime has a stochastic nature, and that quantum mechanics in nelsons formulation
correctly describes this stochasticity.

1 introduction

a physical description is based on the analysis of results of observations, however the laws
of physics should not depend on methods of observations and a choice of an observer. this
condition we shall name as the principle of relativity of observations, and consider as a general
principle to which must satisfy all physical theories. in the paper we shall consider some
measurement procedures and mathematical structures, through which this general principle
is manifested in classical and quantum physics.

2 canonical transformations as transformations of the systems of unperturbing

particularly, the canonical transformations of hamiltonian dynamics will be treated as
transformations of systems of unperturbing devices, the unitary transformations of hilbert
space of states in quantum physics will be represented as transformations of the systems of
perturbing devices. this means that one can take as the rst principles of quantum mechanics
the such physical principles as the relativity under the systems of measuring devices and the
invariance of the fundamental constants h and c [3] which lead to a stochastic geometry of
the physical spacetime.

in the preceding paper [4] some consequences of stochastic treatment of gravitation has
in this paper it will be shown that this treatment can be derived from

been considered.
general physical principles.

2 canonical transformations as transformations of the

systems of unperturbing devices

in the classical physics the system of coordinates have been constructed by using the systems
of devices allowing one to measure complete sets of dynamical variables near each point of
space. there it has been implicitly supposed, that the basic equations of physics do not
depend on a choice of the system of unperturbing devices. we shall name this statement as
the principle of relativity of unperturbing observations (pruo).

if on a system of unperturbing devices an object is described by a full set of dynamical
variables - generalized coordinates and momentum (q, p), and on another system by another
set of coordinates and momentum (p, q), so, according to this principle, the equations of
motion should not depend on the transition from the rst pair of variables to the second
one. we see, that the denition of transformations of the systems of unperturbing devices is
the same as the denition of the canonical transformations, and therefore, we can suppose
that the canonical invariance of the equations of motion of classical physics is expression
of the principle of relativity of unperturbing observations. this treatment allows one to
describe the states of mechanical objects by means of the systems of unperturbing devices in
a phase space with the symplectic structure, where the principle of relativity of unperturbing
observations is represented across the canonical group of symmetry.

from this point of view, the applicability of the hamiltonian dynamics to various physical
structures testies that their dynamical variables can be measured by the system of unper-
turbing devices, or they can be reduced to the such variables. this interpretation partly
explains the universality of the hamiltonian structures not only in the classical mechanics,
but in other elds of physics also.

3 spacetime in the systems of perturbing devices

the existence of the planck constant h as an action quantum requires to extend the principle
of relativity of observations to the systems of perturbing devices (spd). further we shall
convince, that the such extension is possible, and moreover, that the quantum theory can
be considered as its result. here we shall consider the change of the structure of space and
time in spd.

let we have a system of perturbing devices as a set of classically described measurement

4 relativity of perturbing observations and transformations of spd2

devices near each point of euclidean space. let during the measurements of coordinates and
times of classical particles of small mass, the particles scatter on devices at many points of
their trajectories. then, in the limiting case, the trajectories of the such particles will be
similar to brownian trajectories, and the classical mechanics must be replaced by the theory
of brownian motion. the system of perturbing devices here plays a role of an environment
with some diusion coecient and the observables should be dened in a statistical ensemble
of measurements. instead of the denite coordinates and momentum of the particles, here
we deal with the probability densities and the transition probability densities.

two kinds of brownian processes are known - the usual dissipative (wieners) diusion
and nondissipative (nelsons) diusion [1]. the examples of the dissipative systems of per-
turbing devices with wieners diusion are the wilson and bubble chambers in which a high
energy particle interacts with atoms of the medium along the trajectory and loses the energy.
at nelsons diusion the energy of an ensemble of particles is conserved and the equa-
tions of diusion are reversible in time in contrary to irreversible wiener processes. here
we consider the construction of such conservative systems of devices, in which the motion
of particles represents nelsons diusion [3]. this is a set of large number massive screens
with innite number slits on each screen [5]. let the slits have massive shutters, which must
rapidly open and close the slits during very short time. at the opening and closing of the
shutters the sample particles scatter on them. as the result, the energy and momentum of
the particles may change suciently, while the mean energy and momentum of the massive
shutters and screens do not change at the such scatterings. therefore, the tangent compo-
nents of the momentum and kinetic energy of the scattering particles change stochastically
but their mean values remain unchanged.

here a physical reason for the conservative behavior is the fact, that all elements of the
measuring devices are massive (macroscopic) objects, essentially exceeding the masses of the
sample particles. at the such ratio of the masses, it is possible to consider the collisions
of the classical particles of small mass with very massive devices as absolutely elastic (on a
rest frame of the shutter). the energy conservation of the ensemble of particles leads to the
temporal reversibility of their equations of motions.

thus in spd the structure of spacetime becomes stochastic and the galilean (or minkowski)

geometry of spacetime should be replaced by the stochastic geometry. in the dissipative spd
this is stochastic spacetime with wieners measure, and in nondissipative spd - spacetime
with nelsons measure.

4 relativity of perturbing observations and transfor-

mations of spd

in classical mechanics with unperturbing devices it is insucient how many screens there
are between two spatial points at particles trajectory. however, if we take into account the
scattering of the particle on the screens with moving shutters, then a number of scatterings
becomes sucient for the nal probability density of the such observed particles. at the
increasing of the number n of the screens between initial and nal positions, the temporal
intervals between the scatterings of the particles on neighbor shutters decrease, and at n 
 we have t  0. in fact, this is nothing but as some transformation of the system of
perturbing devices, and the physically interesting variables are those which tend to nite

4 relativity of perturbing observations and transformations of spd3

values at the such increasing of n.

here we consider the such transformations of spd and some conditions required by the
principle of relativity of observations. an ensemble of particles in spd is described by a
probability density  (x, t) and a transition probability density p(x, t; x, t). in fact, there
are two families of transition probabilities p, where p+(x, t; x0, t0), describes the direct in
time transition probabilities t > t0, while p(x, t; x0, t0) describes the backward in time
transition probabilities t < t0. it is clear that in the conservative diusion both types must
appear in the symmetric form. in the particular case of nelsons kinematics these two types
of transition probabilities can be reduced to one a function s(x, t) and a diusion coecient
 [1] (see review [2]).

a given spd diers from another one only by the transition probability densities p(x, t; x0, t0)

describing the temporal evolution of  (x, t). for  (x, t) on the rst spd one has:

 (x, t) = z p(x, t; x0, t0) (x0, t0) dx0,

and on the second one with the same initial probability density (x0, t0):

 (x, t) = z p

(x, t; x0, t0)(x0, t0)dx0.

here  and p

 transform as:

 (x, t) = b(x, t) (x, t) = (1 + b) =  + ,

(x, t; x0, t0) = b(x, t)p(x, t; x0, t0)b1(x0, t0) =
p

= p + (bp  pb0) = p + p,

(1)

(5)

where b(x, t) is the operator for the transformations of  (x, t) at the changings of spd.

the probability conservation conditions:

z  (x, t) dx = z  (x, t) dx = z b(x, t) (x, t) dx = 1,

lead for small variations:

z  (x, t) dx = 0,

z b (x, t)  (x, t) dx = b = 0,

since only the spatial distributions of  (x, t) and b change at the such local deformations.
the velocities and diusion coecients of particles in spd are dened as the conditional

expectations:

z dx0p(x, t; x0, t0)(x  x0) = b(x, t)t,

z dx0p(x, t; x0, t0)(xi  xi0)(xj  xj0) = 2n(x, t)ijt,

which transform at the spd transformations as:

lim

t0z dx0b(x, t)p(x, t; x0, t0)b1(x0, t0)(x  x0) = b

(x, t)dt,

lim

t0z dx0b(x, t)p(x, t; x0, t0)b1(x0, t0)(xi  xi0)(xj  xj0) = 2n

ij(x, t)dt.

5 the principle of constancy of action quantum and the diffusion coefficient

5 the principle of constancy of action quantum and

the diusion coecient

in classical mechanics it can be constructed spd with arbitrary small perturbations, and
for a classical particle observing by spd the conditional expectation of the action function
a vanish for innitesimal temporal intervals:

which means that:

lim

t0z dx0p(x, t; x0, t0)a(x, t, x0, t0) = 0,
t0z dx0p(x, t; x0, t0)"m (x  x0)2

# = 0.

t

lim

(13)

(14)

since the classical mechanics is not exact theory for the microscopic phenomena, in the
general case one must to take into account the existence of the action quantum (plancks
constant) h which should be invariant under the transformations of spd. the last state-
ment we shall call as the principle of constancy of action quantum [3]. particularly, if the
conditional expectation of a is equal to h in one of spd, then it should be equal to h in
all other spd. so, we have the expression:

lim

t0z dx0p(x, t; x0, t0)"m (x  x0)2

t

# = h,

or in the spd transformed form:

lim

t0z dx0b(x, t)p(x, t; x0, t0)b1(x0, t0)"m (x  x0)2

t

(15)

(16)

# = h.

we see that, as the consequence of this principle, the conditional expectation e[da | x(t)]
dont vanish at t  0. as the result, we obtain the spd covariant formula for the mean
square values of particles coordinates:

lim

t0z dx0p

(x, t; x0, t0) (x  x0)2 = 

h
m

dt = 2dt,

(17)

where the diusion coecient  = h/2m is exactly the same as in nelsons stochastic for-
mulation of quantum mechanics [1]. but in the stochastic mechanics the value of diusion
coecient has been given equal to  = h/2m by hand, whereas in the present treatment this
formula directly follows from the physically clear rst principles.

since for the spd with the such invariant diusion coecients n

ij = 2ij the ve-
locities u = (b+  b)/2 can be expressed across  (x, t), the spd transformations can be
reduced to the transformations of  (x, t) and v = (b+ + b)/2 only:

6 the quantum principle of equivalence

where s(x, t) is some function, introduced instead of v(x, t) by the expression:

mv = s,

(20)

and which can be derived from an initial lagrangian after the special spd transformations
[6].

finally, we have a functional phase space by the canonical pair (, s) for particles
motion in spd, and the corresponding algebra of observables [7] which are exactly equivalent
to the hilbert space of states and operator algebra of the ordinary quantum mechanics.

6 the quantum principle of equivalence

the mass parameter m in the diusion coecient of spd d = h/2min, considered in the
previous section, is the inertial mass min determined by the kinetic term of an action function
describing the scattering of particles on spd.

in nelsons stochastic mechanics we also have the diusion coecient with the same
inertial mass s = h/2min. the classical sample particle with the inertial mass min freely
moves in the stochastic space, and the process represents the conservative diusion on some
background.

in quantum mechanics, rewritten in terms of the stochastic processes, we have the ef-
fective diusion coecient q = h/2mq, where mq is some mass parameter, determining the
uctuations of coordinates of quantum particles in at and regular galilean space and time
[8]. as it was shown from analysis of the lamb shift data, the quantum diusion mass mq
is equal to the inertial mass with high accuracy [8]:

(min  mq)/min  1013.

therefore, two kind of masses of the particle are equal to each other:

min = mq,

(21)

(22)

and this fact is very important for the understanding of a geometrical nature of quantum
phenomena.

firstly this means the equivalence of the motion of the classical particle on spd in the
ordinary smooth space to the motion of the classical particle in the stochastic space with
unperturbing devices. this fact means also the equivalence of the transition to spd and the
quantum mechanical description (quantization) of the motion of the classical particle.

we can demonstrate this situation in the simple double slit experiment. let we have a
source and a detector of the particles and there exists between them a screen with two slits.
let the particles, emitted by the source and penetrated across the slits, have been registered
by the detectors. after the repeating the experiment many times, an observer obtains the
interference picture on the detectors. the observer, which have only photographic plate with
interference picture, can not distinguish dierences between three interpretations:

a) space is empty and euclidean, but the particles have quantum properties (wave

function) leading to the interference. this is the quantum mechanical interpretation;

b) space is empty and stochastic, and the motion of the classical particles on this back-

ground leads to the interference. this is the interpretation of the stochastic mechanics;

c) space is smooth and euclidean, but it not empty, and there exist innity number devices
near each point of space. the classical particles interact with this medium of devices, and
as the result, the observer detects the interference. this treatment based on the thought
experiment illustrating the principle of relativity of observations.

further we will call this fact as the quantum principle of equivalence [3]. can we conclude
from these statements that quantum mechanics is the stochastic geometry of spacetime and
that the stochastic mechanics is a true physical formulation of quantum mechanics? is the
physical spacetime stochastic?

for the answer to these questions, let us remind an analogue with einsteins proof of a
geometrical nature of gravitation. from the equality of the inertial and gravitational masses
in general relativity, one has indistinguishability for the observer of three treatments in the
explaining of acceleration of a sample particle:

a) spacetime is euclidean, the reference frame is inertial, but there exist a gravitational

eld with the potential  (the eld treatment);

b) spacetime is riemannian, the reference frame is (locally) inertial, and no any external

eld (geometric treatment);

c) spacetime is euclidean in a global inertial frame, but the reference frame of the observer

is accelerated, and no external eld (kinematic treatment).

after analyzing these situations in general relativity, the geometric theory of gravita-
tion has been established. analogously, we can conclude, that the quantum principle of
equivalence allows us to justify the stochastic geometrical version of quantum mechanics. it
is important, that quantum mechanics is nothing but as the stochastic geometry of space-
time, has the very important consequence as an explanation of gravitation as inhomogeneous
quantum diusion [4].
