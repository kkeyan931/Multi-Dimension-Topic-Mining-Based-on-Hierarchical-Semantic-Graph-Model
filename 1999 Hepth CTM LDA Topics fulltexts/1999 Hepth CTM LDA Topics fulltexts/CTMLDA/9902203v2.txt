abstract

an expression for the exact (nonperturbative) eective action of n =1 su-
persymmetric gauge theories is proposed, supposing, that all particles except
for the gauge bosons are massive. analysis of its form shows, that instanton
eects in the supersymmetric theories can lead to the quark connement. the
typical scale of connement in mssm qcd, calculated from the rst principles,
is in agreement with the experimental data. the proposed explanation is quite
dierent from the dual higgs mechanism.

1 introduction

one of the most important unsolved problems of modern theoretical physics is
the explanation of the quark connement [1]. usually the connement is believed to
be an essentially nonperturbative eect. recently there is an considerable progress
in understanding of the nonperturbative dynamics, caused by the paper [2]. in this
paper the sum of all instanton corrections for the simplest case of n=2 supersym-
metric yang-mills theory was found. nevertheless, the model, considered by seiberg
and witten is not physical. it is much more interesting to investigate n=1 super-
symmetric theories, because indirect experimental data [3, 4] show the presence of
n=1 supersymmetry in the standard model. that is why below we will consider this
case.

from the other side, the presence of supersymmetry is very important and essential
for the mechanism of connement, proposed in this paper. this mechanism is quite
dierent from the dual higgs mechanism [5], which is usually used for the qualitative

understanding of this phenomenon. actually it is based on an assumption about the
structure of eective potential beyond the perturbation theory and essentially uses
the existence of auxiliary eld d in supersymmetric theories.

a great dierence between qcd and grand unication scales, that is usually re-
ferred as the gauge hierarchy problem is an indirect implication, that the connement
is induced by instanton eects. remind, that two quite dierent scales naturally arise
in instanton calculations [6], their ratio being proportional to exp(82/e2). how-
ever, expressions for the nonperturbative eective action of n=1 supersymmetric
gauge theories, proposed in the literature [7, 8, 9] do not lead to the connement.

having analyzed instanton eects in this paper we propose a new (hypothetical)
expression for the eective action (if all particles except for the gauge bosons are
massive), which, in turn, leads to the connement, in particular in the su(3)-sector
of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (mssm qcd). the typical scale of
connement can be calculated from the rst principles.

in the section 2 we discuss the structure of instanton contributions to the eective
action and try to nd their sum (i.e. the low energy eective action for n=1 super-
symmetric yang-mills theory with matter, all particles except for the gauge bosons
being massive) from some general arguments. the superpotential appears to depend
on gauge and auxiliary elds in a very particular way. in the section 3 we argue, that
such dependence produces the quark connement in a sense, that asymptotic color
states can not exist. the investigation shows, that there are two phases in the
model: a conning phase at distances, larger, than a critical one and a usual phase
at small distances. the interquark potential is also found in this section. the scale
of connement is calculated and compared with the experiment in the section 4. the
results are briey discussed in the conclusion.

2 low energy eective action for mssm qcd

mssm qcd is a n=1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with the gauge group
su(3) and six matter supermultiplets. all particles, excluding the gauge bosons, are
massive.
in the present paper we will consider a similar theory with the su(nc)
gauge group and nf matter supermultiplets. it is described by the action

the scalars  and  are their superpartners (squarks), f and f are auxiliary elds.
below the supersymmetry is considered to be broken. however, we are not in-
terested in the concrete mechanism. it is only essential, that there are some soft
terms, breaking the supersymmetry, for example, the gluino mass.

because the connement is a low energy phenomenon, we will try to construct
the exact eective action below the thresholds for all massive particles 1. it should
satisfy the following requirements:

1. depend on the original (instead of composite) elds of the theory
2. agree with dynamical (perturbative and instanton) calculations (this require-
ment is much more restrictive, than the agreement with the transformation law of
the collective coordinate measure, used in [9]).

of course, the exact eective action can be found only after carrying out the
dynamical calculations and summing the series of instanton corrections. however, in
this paper we present some arguments, which allow to suggest its form.

first, let us nd the general structure of the eective action. we will assume, that
it can be presented as a sum of an expression, invariant under the supersymmetry
transformations, and (mass) terms, which can break the supersymmetry. we will be

1as we will see below, this condition is not satised for u and d quarks. nevertheless, it is not very

essential, because the mass dependence of the eective action is not changed above the threshold.

interested only in holomorphic part of the sypersymmetric terms. in order to nd
it note, that there is a relation between perturbative and instanton contributions
[6, 10, 11].
in particular, the requirement of perturbative renorminvariance of
instanton contributions allows to construct exact -functions of the supersymmetric
theories.

let us express this relation mathematically. chose a scale m and denote the
value of the coupling constant at this scale by e. then the one-loop result will
be proportional to 1/4e2, while instanton contributions will be proportional to
exp(82n/e2), where n is a module of a topological number. (one-loop contribution
and instanton corrections are renorminvariant separately.)
the holomorphic part of the perturbative wilson eective action can be written

as

la =

(4)

where eef f and ef f are renorminvariant functions of elds, the perturbative eective
coupling constant and vacuum angle respectively. denoting

(5)

the exact eective lagrangian (including instanton contributions) can be presented
in the following form:

la =

1

322 im trz d2 w 2(cid:16)  i ln z +



xn=1

cnzn(cid:17).

(6)

(let us note, that we did not use so far the constant eld approximation, that is

usually assumed for the derivation of exact results.)

in order to nd the function g(z), we will use the theorem, that the conditions

g(z) = i ln z +



xk=0

cnzn,

im g(z) > 0;

cn  im,

(7)

uniquely dene its form up to a constant. (the unequality im g(z) > 0 is a require-
ment of the positiveness of the eective charge and the condition cn  im follows from
the structure of instanton corrections.) the constant is chosen so that the eective
charge can have arbitrary real values (and, therefore, there is a point z, such that
g(z) = 0). as it was shown in [12], these conditions uniquely lead to the following
z-dependence

g(z) = 2  (z1/4),

where the function  (a) is seiberg-witten solution

therefore, nally we obtain

la =

imz d2 w 2 (z1/4),

(9)

(10)

(11)

where the parameter z can be approximately found in the one-loop approximation
and exactly by the investigation of instanton measure similar to [10, 11].

because in the one-loop approximation the -function is written as

(e) = 

e3
162 (3nc  nf ),

(12)

the parameter z should be proportional to m 3ncnf , where m is an uv-cuto. the
same result can be obtained from the expression for the instanton measure [13] (in a
complete agreement with the above arguments).

the purpose is to construct the eective action in the low-energy limit, i.e. below
the thresholds for all massive particles. the contributions of massive particles into the
running coupling constant are xed at the masses and, therefore, their contributions to
the parameter z will be proportional to m/m in a power, dened by the corresponding
coecient of the -function. it is much more dicult to investigate the contributions
of massless gauge elds. of course, in this case the coupling constant is not xed
at a denite value and we need to perform a detailed analysis of the ir behavior
of the theory. note, that we are interested not in the renormgroup functions but in
the eective action, that can be calculated, for example, in the constant eld limit.
therefore, the contribution of the massless gauge eld to the parameter z will be a
function of these elds, instead of masses.

because z is a scalar, in the constant eld limit it is necessary to nd the chiral
scalar supereld, which does not contain the derivatives of f and anticommuting
elds in the lowest component (otherwise all suciently large powers of z will be
equal to 0 or innity). the only supereld b satisfying these requirements is dened
as

b =

(13)

where the index a runs over the generators of a gauge group. (at the perturbative
level similar expression was proposed in [14]).

taking into account dimensional arguments, we nd, that the contributions of
massless gauge elds to the parameter z should be proportional to m/b1/4 in a
degree, dened by the corresponding coecient of the -function.

the one-loop -function can be presented as

(e) =

162 (cgauge + c + cq + csq),

where we denote

(15)

the contribution of yang-mills elds (with ghosts), their spinor superpartners, quarks
and squarks respectively. then, taking into account the above arguments, we obtain

where m is a gluino mass, (mq)j

i are mass matrixes of quarks and squarks.
it should be noted, that the equation (16) was found in the one-loop approxima-
tion. multiloop eects can be included into the wilson eective action [15, 10, 11],
if we take into account, that the instanton measure [13] contains the factor (1/e2)nc,
which, certainly, will be present in z. therefore, the parameter z (up to a constant
c) is nally written as

z = c  1

e82/e2

m 3ncnf  m2/3

(cid:16)det(mq)j

i(cid:17)2/3(cid:16)det(msq)j

i(cid:17)1/3

(17)

where we took into account su(nf ) symmetry of rotation in the avor space and
restored indexes of generations.

let us denote

c =   1

m 3ncnf(cid:16)det(mq)j

i(cid:17)2/3(cid:16)det(msq)j

i(cid:17)1/3!3/(11nc)

then the expression for z can be written in the following form:

z =   c

b1/4!11nc/3

.

as we will see below, c is a typical scale of connement.

3 connement mechanism

now, let us note, that the eld d, although being auxiliary, is a real quantum
eld and should be integrated out. in the considered low energy limit it is necessary
to substitute all squarks wave functions by their vacuum expectation values, which
are equal to 0 because the gauge group su(3) is not broken. therefore, the equation
of motion for the eld d should be obtained from the action

sw =

1

16

im trz d4x d2 w 2 (z1/4).

(20)

then, let us note that due to the supersymmetry and (13) the eld d is present

in sw only in the following combination

b = (da)2 

1

(f a

)2 

i
2

f a


f a
.

(21)

therefore, as can be easily seen performing the integration over the anticommuting
variable, the bosonic part of the lagrangian can be presented as

lbose =

1
8

im(cid:16)bf (b)(cid:17),

(22)

in the vacuum state the eld d has such value, that lbose is minimal.

where f (b)   (z1/4(b)).
if the
magnetic eld is absent, then ff = 0 and the parameter b can be considered to
be real.
the plot of the function im(cid:16)bf (b)(cid:17) is presented at fig.1. (for simplicity we set

c = 1 at all gures.)

using expressions for a(u) and ad(u) in terms of elliptic functions [16], it is easy

to see, that im(cid:16)bf (b)(cid:17) has the only extremum b0, satisfying the condition

a(b0) = z1/4(b0) = 4/

(23)

in the minimum point  (z1/4(b0)) = 0, so that there is no kinetic term for
 is a lagrange multiplier, which

the gauge eld in the vacuum state. therefore, aa
corresponds to the constraint

j a
 = 0.

(24)

condition (24) means, that there are no asymptotic color state and, therefore, leads
to connement of color charges.

at the rst sight from the above consideration one can mistakenly conclude, that
color charges can not exist in dierent space points. really, the kinetic term for the
yang-mills theory is usually written as

7

1
4e2 trf 2
,



(25)

where f = aa+i[a, a]. if the corresponding term is absent, the eective
charge becomes innite, that, in turn, leads to the innitely strong interaction.
however, investigating the quarks interaction it is necessary to take into account

the cromomagnetic eld, produced by quarks, in the simplest case

aa

 =

qa
r

0

because in the absence of magnetic eld (21) is real and can be written as

b = (da)2 + (ea)2,

(26)

(27)

the second term is larger than b0 for suciently small r. therefore, it is impossible

to reach the minimal value of the function im(cid:16)bf (b)(cid:17) by any choice of the real eld
da. as it is seen from the presented plot, the function im(cid:16)bf (b)(cid:17) is monotonically
growing, so that its minimum corresponds to the minimal value of b, which, cer-
tainly, corresponds to d = 0. because in this case evidently b 6= b0,  (b) 6= 0 and,
therefore, gauge eld has a kinetic term and the theory becomes the usual quantum
cromodynamics.

thus, there are two quite dierent phases in the considered model. in the rst
one, corresponding to b0 > (ea)2, the value of the auxiliary eld d is not equal to 0
(to be exact (da)2 + (ea)2 = b0), there is no kinetic term for the gauge eld and color
charges are conned. in the second phase b0 < (ea)2, d = 0 and the theory can be
described by usual methods. the point of phase transition rc corresponds to

from (19) and (23) we conclude, that

b0 = (ea)2 

1
r4

(b0)1/4 = c  4

!12/(11nc)

,

(28)

(29)

so that c is really a typical scale of connement.

nevertheless, the above picture does not predict the linear growing of the in-
terquark potential. instead of it we obtain, that for r, larger than a critical value rc,
the potential is innite. at the small r, using the motion equations, we obtain that

where f1(b) = f (b) + bf (b). therefore, the potential is given by

(cid:16)imf1(1/r4)u(cid:17) = const (r)

u(r)  z

dr

r2(cid:16)imf1(1/r4)(cid:17)

8

(30)

(31)

that is actually a colomn potential, modied by the quantum corrections.

the plot of potential (31) is presented at fig. 2. (as earlier, c = 1 and, moreover,
we omit quark charges for simplicity, that gives rc = (b0)1/4.) a normalization
constant is chosen so that u(rc) = 0.

4 connement scale

in this section we will investigate only mssm qcd, which is a particular case of

the considered model corresponding to nc = 3 and nf = 6.

in principle, due to the renorminvariance, c can be calculated at any scale,
for example, at the grand unication scale. in this case the value of the coupling
constant in mssm should be set to be e2  1/2 and for the connement scale from
(18) we obtain

c = me162/11 m4

qm2
m 8

m2
sq

!1/11

.

(32)

unfortunately, we do not know masses of superpartners. moreover, in this ex-
pression we omit a constant factor, which can be rather large and slightly change the
result. (from the other side, the corresponding contribution is close to 1, because
this factor is in 1/11 degree).

nevertheless, a rough estimate of c can be made. setting all masses equal to 10

 100 gev (m = 2  1016 gev), we obtain that

that is in a good agreement with the experimental data.

c  0.09  0.46 gev

(33)

5 conclusion

in the present paper we propose a mechanism of connement, which is quite
dierent from the dual higgs mechanism [5], that is usually used for understanding
of this phenomenon. however, this mechanism is a rather natural consequence of the
structure of exact eective action (11), with the parameter z, given by equation (17).
however, it should be noted, that (11) is only a hypotheses, that can be conrmed
(rejected or modied) only by the perturbative and instanton calculations, similar to
[17]. in the paper we presented some facts in its favor, for example, the agreement
with the exact novikov, shifman, vainshtein and zahkarov -function [10] (that can
be easily veried) or the positiveness of the eective charge. nevertheless, they can
not be considered as a strict proof.

9

in the mechanism of connement, proposed in this paper, the two main point are
the most essential: first, it is the existence of auxiliary eld d in supersymmetric
gauge theories. second, we use highly nontrivial form of the bosonic part of the
eective action, which is obtained by summing a series of instanton corrections.

however, the interquark potential is appeared not to have linear growing at the
large distances. instead of it there are two dierent regions (or phases). in the one
phase (at distances, larger than a critical one) the kinetic term for the gauge eld is
absent and the potential is innitely large. in the other phase the theory behaves in
a standard way, the potential being approximately equal to the colomn one. (similar
potentials are used in the bag models [18]).

nevertheless, the proposed mechanism of connement is not reduced to the exis-
tence of this potential. actually we predict the absence of color states at the large
distances, that is actually observed in the nature. moreover, we automatically obtain
the connement of electric (instead of magnetic) charges and need not to use duality.
the connement scale can be calculated from the rst principles and is in a good
agreement with the experiment, especially taking into account the absence of exper-
imental data on the superpartners masses.
