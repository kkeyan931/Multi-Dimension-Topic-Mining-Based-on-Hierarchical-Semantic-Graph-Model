we provide a complete picture to the self-gravitating non-relativistic gas at thermal equilibrium
using monte carlo simulations (mc), analytic mean eld methods (mf) and low density expansions.
the system is shown to possess an innite volume limit, both in the canonical (ce) and in the
microcanonical ensemble (mce) when n, v  , keeping n/v 1/3 xed. we compute the equation
of state (we do not assume it as is customary), specic heat, compressibility, speed of sound and
analyze their properties, signs and singularities. the mf equation of state obeys a rst order
non-linear dierential equation of abel type. the mf gives an accurate picture, except near the
clumping transition to a dense phase. at this point mc results show cv  (c  )0.8, that is
non-mf behaviour. the inhomogeneous particle distribution in the ground state suggest a fractal
distribution with haussdorf dimension d  2.

the study of the self-gravitating thermal gas has both
fundamental and practical physical interest [1,2]: (i) it
possess remarkable thermodynamic properties due to the
long range of the gravitational force [such properties
never occur in ordinary systems with short range forces].
(ii) it plays a central role in astrophysics and cosmology.
cold clouds in the interstellar medium and its remarkable
observed scaling laws (from 104pc up to 100pc), as well
as galaxy distributions (up to 100  200mpc) can be de-
scribed with it. (iii) it is relevant for the study of stellar
objects in the non-relativistic and relativistic cases.

the ground state is inhomogeneous and the usual
thermodynamic limit: number of particles n  , vol-
ume v  , with n/v xed leads to collapse into a
very dense phase. the gaseous phase can only exist when
n, v   with n/v 1/3 xed. this is a diluted limit
where the particle density n/v goes to zero as v 2/3.
the appropriate dimensionless variable for particles of
mass m at temperature t on a box of size r is   g m2n
(it can be a spherical or cubic box of radius r or side
l = (4/3)1/3 r, respectively). we call thermodynamic
limit the limit n  , r   with a xed ratio r/n .
the physical magnitudes in this limit naturally express
as functions of .

r t

for small  the gas behaves as a perfect gas. for
growing , p v /n t (where p is the pressure) decreases
(see gs.1-2) due to the attractive character of gravity.
finally, at some critical crit the gas exhibits a sharp
clumping transition to a dense phase with negative
pressure. the extension of the gaseous phase and the
value crit depend on the thermodynamical ensemble (see
gs.1-2): the gas phase is larger in the microcanonical
ensemble (mce) and smaller in the canonical ensemble
(ce). we investigate the self-gravitating gas with monte
carlo (mc) and analytic mean eld (mf) methods. in
the dilute limit we expand in powers of . our results
show that the ce and mce yield the same results in

1

their common range of the gaseous phase. the mf cor-
rectly describes the thermodynamic limit except near the
critical points, the mf is valid for n|  crit|  1. the
vicinity of the critical point should be studied in a double
scaling limit n  ,   crit.
the particle distribution (~q) turns to be inhomoge-
neous (except for  << 1) and described by an universal
function of the geometry,  and the ratio ~r = ~q/r. for
 not very far from crit the particle density in the bulk
behaves as (~q)  rd3 with d  2. this indicates the
presence of a fractal distribution with haussdorf dimen-
sion d  2.

can be straightforwardly computed both in eq.(1) and in

we have veried properties (a)-(c) in three ways. first,
by direct calculation in the dilute regime ( >> 1 ,  <<
1) by expanding eqs.(4) and eqs.(5) in powers of 1/ and
 for the mce and ce, respectively. second, by per-
forming monte carlo simulations both in the mce and
the ce. third, by mean eld approximations to eqs.(4)
and eqs.(5).

in the ce and mce. in the ce, the specic heat is related
to the uctuations of the potential energy (u )2 and it

the integrands in eqs.(4) and eqs.(5) in powers of 1/ or
, respectively. in the n   limit the expressions sim-
plify considerably. moreover, divergent integrals in the
zero cuto limit are eliminated by 1/n factors. that is,
the cuto dependence is very mild in the thermodynamic
limit. we nd after calculation,

monte carlo calculations. we applied the standard
metropolis algorithm in a cube of size l with total energy
e in the mce and at temperature t in the ce. the
number of particles n went up to 2000.

two dierent phases show up: for  < c it is a non-
perfect gas and for  > c it is a condensed system
with negative pressure. the transition between the two
phases is very sharp, with a negative jump in the en-
tropy from the gas to the condensed phase. this phase
transition is associated with the jeans unstability.

we plot in gs.1-2 f () = p v /[n t ] as a function of .
for small , the mc results for p v /[n t ] reproduce very
well the analytical formula (8). p v /[n t ] monotonically
decreases with  as forecasted by the dilute expansion (8).

for  close to c  2.4 (point c in g.2) a phase transi-
tion suddenly happens in the ce and p v /[n t ] becomes
large and negative. the interparticle distance < r >
monotonically decreases with  too. near c , < r > has
a sharp decrease. when   c the specic heat cv and
the energy uctuations (u )2 diverge in the ce as

(u )2 c= a (c  )y

(9)

with y  0.8 and a  0.2.
the mce and ce monte carlo results are very close
(up to the statistical error) for 0 <  < c, that is for
 >  > c  0.20. in the mce the gas does not clump
at  = c (point c in g.2) and the specic heat becomes
negative between the points c and m c. the gas does
clump in the mce at   0.25 ,   2.39 (point m c
in g.2) increasing its temperature discontinuosly while
its pressure jumps to negative values. as is clear, the
domain between c and m c cannot be reached in the
ce since cv > 0 in the ce.

nate partition function en () as a functional integral in
the thermodynamic limit.

the rst term is the potential energy, the second term is
the functional integration measure for this case (see [3]).

where dc () stands for the determinant of small uc-
tuations around the spherically symmetric saddle point
(12) and c() for the two-loop corrections. dc () can
be expressed as an innite product over the partial waves

puted in close form [4]

d0() and d1() [see g.1] are positive for 0    c =

it follows from eq.(13) and (16) that fmf () obeys the
rst order equation

(3f  1)f () + (3f  3 + )f = 0 .

which reduces to an abel equation of rst kind [6].

by expanding the solution of eq.(13) in powers of  one
checks that eq.(15) reproduces eq.(8) [4]. we plot in g.1
fmf () as a function of  obtained by solving eqs.(13-15)
by the runge-kutta method. we nd that mc results
(both in the mce and ce) and the mf results are very
close except near the critical points c and m c. (this
happens although the geometry for the mc calculation
is cubic while it is spherical for the mf).

the clumping phase transition takes place when dc()
vanishes at  = c. at such point the expansion in 1/n
breaks down since the correction terms become large in
eqs.(14-15). mf applies when n|c  | >> 1. however,
since

eq.(15) correctly suggests that p v /[n t ] becomes large
