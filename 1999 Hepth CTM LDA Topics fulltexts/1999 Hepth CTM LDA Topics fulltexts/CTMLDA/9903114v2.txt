abstract

the hilbert spaces of supersymmetric systems admit symmetries
which are often related to the topology and geometry of the (target)
eld-space. here, we study certain (2,2)-supersymmetric systems in 2-
dimensional spacetime which are closely related to superstring models.
they all turn out to posess some hitherto unexploidted and geometri-
cally and topologically unobstructed symmetries, providing new tools
for studying the topology and geometry of superstring target space-
times, and so the dynamics of the eective eld theory in these.

1. introduction

it has been known by now for quite some time [1] that there exists a formal but rather pre-
cise analogy between supersymmetry and exterior calculus. this analogy derives from the
fact that the generators of supersymmetry are anticommuting and so nilpotent dierential
operators just as exterior derivatives are.

we now turn to our case of interest: the 2-dimensional (2,2)-supersymmetric gauged
linear -models [2], exemplied here by a simple landau-ginzburg/calabi-yau model.
for simplicity, we consider a simple hypersurface in a projective space; generalizations to
intersections of hypersurfaces in toric varieties and the corresponding more general gauged
linear -models are notationally tedious but straightforward. indeed, the same analysis
will apply to gauged -models with non-abelian gauge symmetries, and so geometries
of complete intersections of hypersurfaces within non-abelian orbit spaces, not just toric
varieties. in the present case, the commuting canonical coordinates are , , with  =
0,   , n, the map immersing the world sheet (riemann surface) into the target space ipn
for which the  serve as homogeneous coordinates. the supersymmetric ground states
turn out to be further constrained to x, the hypersurface w ()=0 in ipn.

the anticommuting variables, 

 are local sections of k 1/2(tx ) and
k 1/2(t x), where k is the canonical bundle of the world-sheet. they satisfy the
equal-time anticommutation relations
(cid:8) 

 (cid:9) = g ,

(1)

, 

 , 

where g is a metric on the target space x. owing to (1), half of the +s and half
of the s can be interpreted as creation operators, the other half then being annihila-
tion operators. that is, there are two possible choices of cliord-dirac vacua (and their
conjugates):

and


+ |0icc  0  

 |0icc ,

the (c, c)-vacuum ,


+ |0iac  0  

 |0iac ,

the (a, c)-vacuum .

(2)

(3)

using these two distinct vacua, two distinct types of states (and their conjugates) can be
dened:

|; b, qicc = 1b

 1 q

(,  ) 1+  b+  1

   

q
 |0icc ,

where +

def= g

+, and

|; p, qiac = 1p 1q (,  ) 1

+   

p
+  1

   

q
 |0iac .

(4)

(5)

upon the formal identication 

+  dz, we have that
|; b, qi correspond to btx -valued dolbeault q-forms, whereas |; p, qi correspond to (p, q)-
forms. furthermore, those |; b, qi and |; p, qi which are annihilated by all supercharges
represent zero-energy states, correspond to harmonic forms, and so encode information
about global geometry and topology of the hypersurface w ()=0 within ipn.

2. two ubiquitous sl(2, c) actions

the case at hand falls in a very well studied category: the hypersurface w ()=0 in ipn
is kahler. now, the p, q-forms on all kahler manifolds admit a so-called lefschetz sl(2)
action, depending, besides the canonical wedge product and hodge star operator, only on
the choice of the kahler metric [3]. the fermionic analogue of this sl(2) action has been
known for some time (see refs. [4,5], and references therein).

2.1. the standard lefschetz sl(2, c) algebra

acting on the wave-functions (4), (5) and their conjugates, we dene two ladder opera-
tors:

l+

def= g

+

 ,

l

def= g 



+ ,

and calculate their commutator:

h

def= (cid:2) l+ , l (cid:3) = g g(cid:2)
= g g(cid:16)
(cid:9)
= g(cid:0)
+
(cid:1) .

+(cid:8)
+  

 , 



+

 , 

+  


(cid:8)

+(cid:3) ,
+ , 

+(cid:9)

(cid:17) ,

(6a, b)

(6c)

using the anticommutation relations (1), this expression can be brought into the more
standard form:

h = g(cid:0)

+

+ + 



(cid:1)  (n+1) ,

(6d)

where now the creation operators (when acting on p,q |; p, qiac) are to the left of the
annihilation operators. the monomials 
 are simply (fermion) number
operators, and h then simply stands for the total (fermion) number operator, shifted so
that its eigenvalues on |; p, qi range from (p+q) = (n+1) to (p+q) = (n+1).

+ and 



+

a similar calculation veries that

(cid:2) h , l (cid:3) = 2l ,

whence {l, h} form an sl(2) algebra. it is similarly easy to verify that:

l |; p, qiac 7 |; p1, q1iac ,

(7)

(8)

so that this sl(2) action coincides with the standard lefschetz sl(2) action. in the usual
layout of the hodge diamond, where the (p, q) = (0, 0)- and (n, n)-forms are at the bottom
 play the roles
and top corners, respectively, this sl(2) acts vertically.
of griths and harriss formal basis elements ek, ek, while 
+ play the roles of their
duals, ik,ik [3]. finally, we complexify g  (g +ib ), using the antihermitian 2-form
b familiar from 2-dimensional -models related to string theory. the sl(2) transformation
parameters thus become complex, producing the complexied lefschetz sl(2, c) action.

in fact, 

+,

2.2. the mirror sl(2, c) algebra

the existence of the mirror map among (families of) calabi-yau 3-folds implies that there
exists a y , the mirror model of the manifold x, such that h q(x, pt 
x )  h q(y, pty )
and h q(x, ptx )  h q(y, pt 
x on calabi-yau n-folds.
therefore, the mirror map identications may also be stated as h p,q(x)  h np,q(y ). the
standard lefschetz sl(2) action on h p,q(x) is then mapped to an action on h np,q(y ),
where it now acts horizontally! similarly, the standard lefschetz sl(2) action on h p,q(y )
has a pre-image on h np,q(x), where it acts horizontally.

y ); note that ptx = npt 

in the landau-ginzburg model for x, this horizontal lefschetz-like sl(2) action is
easy to identify. recall that x is dened as the w =0 hypersurface within ipn; let then
w =  w . we now dene another two ladder operators:

+

def= w  

+

 , 

def= w 



+ ,

(9a, b)

where w 
furthermore,

def= gw g, with w  being the matrix-inverse of w: w w  = 
 .

+  
again, we may rewrite this as in the more standard way as

def= (cid:2) + ,  (cid:3) = g(cid:2)

+





(cid:3) .

 = g(cid:2)

+

+ + 



(cid:3)  (n+1) .

(9c)

(9d)

again, the creation operators (now when acting on b,q |h; b, qicc) are to the left of the
annihilation operators. the monomials 
 are again the (fermion) number
operators, and  then simply stands for the total (fermion) number operator, shifted so
that its eigenvalues on |h; b, qi range from (b+q) = (n+1) to (b+q) = (n+1).

+ and 

+



a quick calculation veries that

(cid:2)  ,  (cid:3) = 2 ,

whence {, } form another sl(2) algebra. it is similarly easy to verify that:

 |; p, qiac 7 |; p1, q1iac ,

(10)

(11)

so that this second sl(2) action coincides with the mirror map pre-image of the standard
lefschetz sl(2) action on the mirror, y ; it acts horizontally on the hodge diamond of x.
however, note that the action of the ladder operators l and  is swapped when

acting on the |; b, qicc:

l |; b, qicc 7 |; b1, q1icc ,

horizontal action;

 |; b, qicc 7 |; b1, q1icc ,

vertical action.

(12)

moreover, straightforward calculations show that these two sl(2) actions commute,
whence {l, h} and {, } generate an sl(2)lsl(2). on p,q |; p, qiac, the rst
factor acts vertically and the second one horizontally, while on b,q |; b, qicc their actions
are swapped. therefore, sl(2) generated by {, } is the (mirror map pre-image of
the) mirror of sl(2)l generated by {l, h}.

finally, it is obvious that the bogoliubov transformation 

+ becomes exactly
the relative sign change in the action of the u (1)lu (1)r of the corresponding super-
conformal eld theory, and so is the mirror map [6,7;5,8]. it is equally clear that the same
eld redenition also swaps the two sl(2) actions, {l+, l, h}  {+, , }, proving
that these are indeed the mirror (pre)images of each other; see also ref. [9].

+  

3. discussion

the main result proven, we now address some additional issues in turn.

3.1. the mirror map and marginal operators

the denition of {, } uses, most crucially, the hessian of the dening polynomial, w .
notice that g is in fact a kahler metric, and so also a hessian: g =  k. since
the two sl(2, c) algebras are mirror (pre)images of each other, the kahler potential k
for the metric g and the dening polynomial (superpotential) w must be mirrors of
each other. in 2-dimensional (2,2)-superspace, the kahler potential function k is dened
only up to the addition of terms each of which is annihilated at least by one of the four
superderivatives [9]. this undenedness is far larger than in spacetimes of more than
2 dimensions! also unlike its familiar 4-dimensional counterpart, the superpotential in
2-dimensions is similarly undened, although in more restrictive way [9].

furthermore, the denition of  involves the matrix inverse of the hessian of w .
this exists provided the determinant of the hessian is non-zero, and which allows w to
be mildly singular: dw may vanish, as long as the locus of dw =0 are only nodes (double
points). mirror symmetry then implies that k may be singular in the sense that dk may
vanish, as long as the (hermitian) matrix of second derivatives, g , remains invertible.
but this, and nothing more is precisely the standard requirement of the kahler potential!
so, since one never expects anything more of k, mirror symmetry suggests that:

 superpotentials should also be allowed to singularize,

as long as their hessians are invertible [10,11].

in the (2,2)-supersymmetric eld theory, the mirror relation between the kahler po-
tential and the superpotential may come as a surprise. while the latter is a purely chiral
function, the former is a neither chiral nor anti-chiral, but real. whereas the latter enters
the lagrangian as an f -term and does not renormalize 1), the former gures in a d-term,

1) see, e.g., p.358 of ref. [12] for an important caveat to this theorem.

4

not protected by the usual non-renormalization theorems. however, this real function does
give rise to a collection of twisted -chiral marginal operators (one for each (a, c)-modulus),
just as the superpotential produces a collection of chiral marginal operators (one for each
(c, c)-modulus) [13]. of course, the bogoliubov transformation 
+ (a.k.a. mirror
map) also swaps the chiral and the twisted-chiral elds, again verifying that:

+  

 d-terms can yield twisted-chiral marginal operators,

the mirror map (pre)images of the f -term chiral marginal operators.

quite importantly, the denition of the sl(2, c)lsl(2, c) algebra is purely alge-
braic. thus, it comes for free, in any (2,2)-supersymmetric model that features a metric
g and a superpotential w . geometrically, the sl(2, c)lsl(2, c) is unobstructed
since it acts on the contractible bres of the bundle (t t )x . in gauged models, g
is dened upon passing to a gauge slice: e.g., in wittens gauged linear -model, the
gauging of the various u (1) symmetries induces the generalization of the fubini-study
metric on the gauge quotient toric variety within which the hypersurface w ()=0 lies.

also, note that the sl(2, c)lsl(2, c) algebra is a (small) part of what are gen-

erally known as dynamical symmetry/spectrum-generating algebras. that is,

 given a (judiciously chosen) quarter of the supersymmetric |; p, qiacs, the
others are obtained by applying the sl(2, c)lsl(2, c) ladder operators.

3.2. extensions

the sl(2, c)lsl(2, c) symmetry found above may be extended in several ways.

more fermions
clearly, n -fold extended (2,2)-supersymmetry will give rise to n species of fermions,
each of which having n fermions. a more complicated situation occurs in the more general
models of ref. [9], where the dierent species of fermions stem from dierent superelds,
and are therefore not required to be equal in number. returning to the simple case of
n -extended supersymmetry, operators of the type (6) and (9) now become n n matrix
operators in the species space:

li

j+

and eqs. (9) now become

ij+

we will also need:

def= g i

which are antisymmetric in i, j and so vanish when there is a single species of fermions.
also, it will be convenient to use

j i

so that

def= g i

all other commutators being zero. note that the identity, 1l, appears on the right-hand
sides of both eqs. (15d), and so must be included as a generator of the algebra; it of course
commutes with all other generators.

superalgebras

besides the bosonic operators bilinear in the fermions (6) and (9), we can introduce
fermionic operators, linear in the , :

a+ = a

+ ,

a+ = a

+ ,

a = a

 ,

a = a

 ,

6

(16)

their anticommutators must be expressible as a linear combination of 1l, l, h, , , and
the vector space a, a, b, b must form a representation of sl(2, c)lsl(2, c). the
latter requirement forces the commutators of the operators (6) with the (16) to be expanded
over the (16). the rst requirement produces

{a+, a+} = aag1l  kak21l = {a, a} .

(17)

next, we nd

[l+, a+] = 0 ,

[l, a+] = +a ,

[h, a+] = +a+ ,

[l+, a] = +a+ ,

[l, a] = 0 ,

[h, a] = a ,

[l+, a+] =  a ,

[l, a+] = 0 ,

[h, a+] =  a+ ,

[l+, a] = 0 ,

[l, a] =  a+ ,

[h, a] = + a ;

[+, a+] =  a

[+, a+] = 0 ,

[, a+] = + a+ ,

[+, a] = 0 ,

[, a] = + a ,

 def= wg and w

 def= w g act as a (conjugating) linear transfor-
the matrices w
mation on the coecient functions a, a, a, a; they are well-dened since the hessians
w and g are invertible. the relations (18) assure that a and a transform as two
2 doublets, and (19) show that (a+, a) and (a, a+) are sl(2, c) dou-
sl(2, c)l spin- 1
. -transformation. this guarantees that {a, a; 1l, l, h, , }
blets, twisted by the w .
generate a supergroup.

of course, it is also possible to expand the right-hand side of the anticommutators (17)
over non-trivial (dierential) operators over the bosonic degrees of freedom. one such
possibility leads to the well-studied eld-space supersymmetry algebra; see for example
ref. [4]. if the target manifold x admits null-vectors, the a, a may be chosen to have
zero norm, whereupon they generate a brst-like subalgebra of the superalgebra discussed
in eqs. (17)(20). another possibility is to let the a, a take values in a non-abelian lie
algebra. these and other such extensions are left for another occasion.
