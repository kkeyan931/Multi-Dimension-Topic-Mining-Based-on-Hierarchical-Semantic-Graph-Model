(10), = t3 f (x2 + y2) x2 + y2 (yex xey) , = 0 (89) thin vortex centered point x0ex, = t3 1 (x x0)2 + y2 (yex (x x0)ey) (90) 30 oset x0 still varied; ex, ey denote cartesian unit vectors plane. deniteness, following treatment carried using prole function f (r) = (r r), i.e. ring-shaped thick vortex radius r similar one considered section 2.2. case x0 = 0, gauge condition (86) satised congurations, arbitrary gauge xing function g. x0 6= 0, condition (86) general satised. nevertheless, terms variational form (82) gauge xing condition, one relation z ddx g(cid:16)tr(a a)2(cid:17) max g z ddx g(cid:16)tr(a g a)2(cid:17) (91) equality guaranteed x0 = 0. now, possible nd gauge xing functions g, e.g. g = tanh(r4t2), quantity z ddx g(cid:16)tr(a a)2(cid:17) (92) appearing left hand side (91), viewed function x0, exhibits minimum x0 = 0. view (91), implies also quantity right hand side, exhibits minimum x0 = 0 (remember equality guaranteed (91) x0 = 0). therefore, according variational form gauge xing condition (82), optimal location approximating thin vortex con- guration a, parametrized x0, achieved x0 6= 0. conrms phenomenon observed lattice examples section 2.2, thin vortex induced applying center gauge xing procedure radially symmetric thick vortex conguration necessarily appear concentri- cally original thick vortex. property thus constitute lattice artefact, persists also continuum theory. nal remark, note simple choice gauge xing function g(t) = leads trivial optimal thin vortex conguration = 0 smooth initial conguration a. due fact thin vortex eld diverges 1/r, r distance vortex, therefore tr(a a)2 diverges 1/r2 positions thin vortices. therefore, case g(t) = t, choice thin vortex eld render gauge xing functional (88) divergent = 0. consequently, = 0 trivially turns optimal thin vortex approximation, smooth a(x). 31 max g z ddx g(cid:16)tr(a g a)2(cid:17) (93) choice g(t) = gauge xing function thus rst sight seem useful, since cannot lead faithful representation vortex content original smooth gauge eld a. true g(t) diverges fast as, faster than, g(t) = . 3.5.2 remarks direct maximal center gauge choice gauge xing function g(t) = continuum analogue variety lattice gauge xing functions g(x), cf. eq.

(88). then, practice, one insist limit q , would imply nding exact minimum sgf ; instead one may satised nite value q. case, competition gauge xing term yang-mills action (and also competition dierent gribov copies, i.e. relative minima sgf ) becomes possible. even case g(t) = t, gauge xing term general diverge nontrivial thin vortex congurations a, divergences may swamped innite action typical yang-mills eld congurations. note work, yang-mills congurations considerably less singular thin vortices invoked second explanation necessary. e.g., case gauge xing function g(t) = t, gauge xing term nontrivial thin vortex conguration diverge r dr r(1/r2), r denotes distance thin vortex. independent dimension space-time; coordinates perpendicular vortex always span two dimensions. hand, four space-time dimensions, 33 already gauge eld conguration behaves 1/r vicinity point singularity induce action diverging asr dr r3(1/r4); divergence degree induced 1/r line singularity ln(r) sheet singularity four space-time dimensions. 3.5.3 alternative vortex gauges remarks illustrate continuum maximal center gauge form derived section 3.4 sense constitutes excessive rigor. dy- namical calculation, one forced introduce regularization divergences ultraviolet; regularization particular also smears thin vortex congurations a(), used maximal center gauge xing, thick vortices thickness related ultraviolet cuto. view reg- ularization, dictated dynamics, mandated consider intermediate stage behavior gauge eld congurations cuto removed. instead, cuto must kept nite throughout calculation, continuum limit physical observables, encoded renormalization group behavior, relevant. suggests alternative formulation gauge xing procedure one approximates given gauge conguration well possible thick vortices. specically, one generalize gauge condition (86) remaining maximization problem (88) allowing approximating congurations a() comprise thick vortices. course, general- ization clouds original idea maximal center gauge, namely keeping center part gauge freedom lattice unxed; instead, op- erates purely continuum, i.e. coset congurations. therefore, gauges appropriately called maximal vortex gauges rather center gauges. vortex gauges, one additional freedom choice thickness approximating vortex congurations a(). one hand, one may choose thickness related ultraviolet cuto one regulates theory; example, thickness may simply lattice spacing. form would entirely equivalent maximal center gauge lattice theory, since, level regularized theory, distinction thick vortex truly thin one. hand, one may choose thickness xed physical quantity10 10some phenomenological implications physical vortex thickness discussed ,. 34 (which varied optimally match vortex prole preferred yang-mills dynamics). form, thick vortex prole also take role gauge xing function g. example, evidenced examples given above, gauge xing function g act regulator divergences introduced gauge xing functional singularities thin vortices. vortex gauge thick vortices, already achieved vortex thickness. many respects, vortex prole vortex gauge similar eect gauge xing function g maximal center gauge. aside, note consistently regularized theory, one also use regularized versions ideal vortex congurations a, cf. (33), one simply obtains using ultraviolet cuto theory smooth -functions (33), cf. eq. (133). lastly, certain aspect continuum thin (or, equivalently, ideal) vortices yet discussed detail, namely possibility may exist distinct thin vortex uxes contribute identical phase wilson loop link. example given already section 2.2; su(2) thin vortex conguration, eq.
