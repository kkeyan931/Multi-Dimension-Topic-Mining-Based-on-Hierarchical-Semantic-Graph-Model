abstract

we reconsider the kaluza klein compactications of d = 11 supergravity on ads4 
(g/h)7 manifolds that were classied in the eighties,
in the modern perspective of
ads4/cf t3 correspondence. we focus on one of the three n = 2 cases: (g/h)7 =
m 111 = su (3)  su (2)  u (1)/su (2)  u (1)  u (1). relying on the systematic use of
the harmonic analysis techniques developed in the eighties by one of us (p. fre) with r.
dauria, we derive the complete spectrum of long, short and massless osp(2|4) su (3)
su (2) unitary irreducible representations obtained in this compactication. our result
also provides a general scheme for the other n = 2 compactications. furthermore it is a
necessary comparison term in the ads4/cf t3 correspondence: the complete ads/cf t
match of the spectra that we obtain will provide a much more stringent proof of the
ads/cf t correspondence than in the s7 case, since the structure of the superconformal
eld theory on the m 2brane world volume must be such as to reproduce, at the level of
composite operators, the avor group representations, the conformal dimensions and the
hypercharges that we obtain in the present article. the investigation of this match is left
to future publications. here we provide an exhaustive construction of the kaluza klein
side of our spectroscopy.

1 introduction to m 111: old and new viewpoints

in this paper we present the complete kaluza klein spectrum of m-theory compactied on the
sevenmanifold, m 111 that has n = 2 supersymmetry and su(3)  su(2)  u(1) as isometry
group. this is part of a wider project [1], [2] that aims at constructing the kaluza klein spectra
for all the supersymmetric homogeneous sevenmanifolds g/h classied in 1984 by castellani
romans and warner [3].

as we illustrate in this introductory section, this is the nal completion of a research pro-
gramme that was actively ongoing sixteen years ago [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. actually the results presented
here supersede all previous partial results and provide, in our opinion, a comprehensive and
complete understanding of the involved problem. sixteen years ago the project was suddenly
stopped for two reasons: a) failure to obtain the goals that in the 1984 perspective were consid-
ered the main motivations, b) occurrence of the rst string revolution that provided alternative
perspectives to pursue the same goals, that is the derivation of the standard model from a
higherdimensional, unied, locally supersymmetric theory.

the motivation to resume the project is provided by the current interest in the ads/cf t
correspondence and by the occurrence of the second string revolution. this latter has shown
that all ten-dimensional string theories are, together with d=11 supergravity, perturbative
limits of the same quantum theory, named mtheory. hence all compactied solutions of d=11
supergravity are relevant and highlight dierent aspects of mtheory. in particular, as shown
in [9], each supersymmetric ads4  (g/h)7 vacuum of the castellani et al classication has a
corresponding supersymmetric m2brane solution which interpolates between such a vacuum
at the horizon and a vacuum m3 c8 at innity, m3 being the threedimensional minkowskian
world volume of the m2brane and c8 being a suitable kahlerian cone constructed over the
sasakian manifold (g/h)7. following the ideas explained in [10] and the suggestions coming
from the recent literature [11, 12] the nal goal of our investigation is to construct the three-
dimensional superconformal eld theory that is dual to each (g/h)7 compactication of m-
theory. in this direction an essential constructive step and comparison term is the derivation
of the corresponding kaluza klein spectrum, which is our present aim.

in order to introduce the specic example of kaluza klein spectrum we shall calculate and
the harmonic analysis techniques we shall employ we feel it necessary to make a step back and
provide a brief historical perspective for our problem.

1.1 old kaluza klein supergravity: the search for a realistic model

based on m pqr spaces and harmonic analysis

in the beginning of the eighties, after d = 11 supergravity had been discovered [13] and
also reformulated geometrically [14], a lot of interest was attracted by the revival of the kaluza
klein idea [15]. it was conceived that the gauge symmetries of fundamental particle interactions
might be interpreted as isometries of the seven compactied extra dimensions. in particular it
was realized by freund and rubin [16] that d = 11 supergravity admits classical vacua where
the elevendimensional space is the product of fourdimensional anti de sitter space with a

1

compact seven-dimensional einstein space:

m11 = ads4  m7

(1.1)

the killing vectors km
i (y) (i = 1, . . . , dimg) admitted by the einstein metric on m7 close the
lie algebra of the gauge group g, while the number n of killing spinors a(y) (a = 1, . . . ,n )
existing on such a geometry coincides with the number of supersymmetries preserved by the
fourdimensional compactied theory.
initially, kaluza klein supergravity [17] focused on
the case where the compact manifold m7 is topologically a sphere, endowed either with the
so(8) invariant einstein metric (round s7) [18] or with a second einstein metric which is
so(5)so(3) invariant (squashed s7) and preserves n = 1 rather than n = 8 supersymmetry,
as it was shown by awada, du and pope [19]. although the two gauge groups g emerging
from such compactications are not realistic and cannot embed the standard model, an in
depth analysis [20], [21], [22], [23] of these cases revealed many subtle features of kaluza klein
supergravity and of its relation with the gauged n = 8 supergravity of de wit and nicolai
[24]. furthermore after dauria and fre proved [25] that osp(8|4) is the isometry superalgebra
of the round s7 background, then the mass spectrum of such a compactication could be
organized by gunaydin and warner [26] into unitary irreducible representations (uir) of this
noncompact superalgebra. this result of 1985, later extended by gunaydin and marcus to the
spectrum of su(2, 2|4) supermultiplets that arise in the compactication of type iib superstring
on ads5  s5 [27], is one of the cornerstones for the recent reinterpretation of kaluza klein
supergravity within the framework of an ads/cf t correspondence. indeed as a consequence
of the maldacena conjecture [28] that classical supergravity on adsp+2  mdp2 is dual to
a quantum superconformal theory on the (p + 1)dimensional boundary of adsp+2 it follows
that the kaluza klein spectrum of adsp+2 supermultiplets corresponds to the spectrum of
composite primary operators in the conformal eld theory [29],[30],[31], [32],[33],[34]. yet from
the kaluza klein point of view the seven sphere was not very satisfactory since, as already
observed, neither so(8) nor so(5)  so(3) contain the gauge group of the standard model:
(1.2)

gs = su(3)c  su(2)w  u(1)y

however, already in 1981 witten had observed [35] that seven is the smallest number of di-
mensions where the group (1.2) can be realized as a regular isometry group. indeed one can
introduce the sevendimensional homogeneous spaces:

m pqr = gs

h 

su(3)c  su(2)w  u(1)y
su(2)c  u(1)  u(1)

(1.3)

where the integer numbers p, q, r  zz characterize the topology of the manifold and are intro-
duced through the embedding of the isotropy subgroup h = su(2)c  u(1)  u(1) into gs as
explained in section 4. in order to show that ads4  m pqr are exact vacua of d = 11 super-
gravity that produce the standard model gauge group through the kaluza klein mechanism it
was necessary to construct an su(3) su(2) u(1) invariant einstein metric on each of these
spaces. this was done by castellani, dauria and fre in [4]. in the same paper the properties
of these spaces with respect to supersymmetry breaking were discussed. it was established that

2

for p 6= q there are no killing spinors while in the case p = q the resulting fourdimensional
theory has n = 2 supersymmetry. since the spectrum does not depend on the actual value of
p = q or of r 6= 0, we can just focus on the space m 111 hence an early conclusion reached in
[4] was that by compactifying d = 11 supergravity on ads4  m 111 one obtains a low energy
eective action containing the n = 2 supergravity multiplet plus, at least, the vector multiplets
of the group su(3)  su(2). the factor u(1)y in the isometry group is the rsymmetry of
n = 2 supergravity and the associated gauge boson is the graviphoton.
in order to establish the precise content of the theory, both at the massless and the massive
level more information on the spectrum was necessary.

in this respect the case of m 111 was (and it is) quite dierent with respect to the case of the
round s7. in the latter case it suces to know that the isometry superalgebra is osp(8|4) to
deduce the entire spectrum from a purely algebraic construction. the reason is the following.
as shown by gunaydin and warner [26] the complete kaluza klein spectrum of the round s7
compactication is composed of short osp(8|4) supermultiplets characterized by a quantization
of masses (or better anti de sitter energy labels) in terms of the so(8) r-symmetry represen-
tation in which their cliord vacuum falls. in modern language all the kaluza klein states are
bps states and their spectrum can be derived by constructing the short uir of osp(8|4) with
highest spin limited to be two. from the perspective of the three dimensional superconformal
theory this means that all the composite primary operators have conformal weights equal to
their naive dimensions, no anomalous dimensions being generated.

the same results can also be derived from harmonic analysis on the compact space s7 but

no new information is obtained with respect to the algebraic construction.

on the contrary in the case of anti de sitter vacua with n = 1, 2, 3 supersymmetry the
kaluza klein states have to be organized in supermultiplets of osp(n|4)  g where g is the
factor in the isometry group of the sevenmanifold that commutes with supersymmetry and
with the rsymmetry factor o(n ). in this case the kaluza klein states do not necessarily
fall into short multiplets of osp(n|4) and do not necessarily have quantized energy labels (or
masses). indeed their masses depend not only on the rsymmetry representation but also on
the g representation. in the modern perspective of the dual superconformal eld theory this
means that anomalous dimensions are generated, yet if the ads/cf t correspondence is really
true then these anomalous dimensions can be exactly calculated from the supergravity side
by harmonic analysis on the compact sevenmanifold. because of the interest in the d = 11
compactication on m 111 that displayed the standard model group (1.2) as gauge group, the
oldest of us (p.fre), in collaboration with r. dauria, developed in the years 1983-1984 a
systematic approach to the harmonic analysis on coset manifolds with killing spinors and in
particular on m pqr spaces [5, 6, 7]. the formalism and techniques developed in those papers
are the basis for the present investigation where we provide the completion of the classication
programme started fteen years ago in [8]. the results obtained in [5, 6, 7, 8] showed that the
massless sector of m-theory on ads4  m 111 is given by the n = 2 graviton multiplet plus
the vector multiplets of su(3)  su(2)  u(1). indeed, although u(1)y is the rsymmetry
and its gauge-boson is the graviphoton, an additional massless vector multiplet, at the time
named the betti multiplet, comes from the threeform aij with a spacetime index and two
internal indices. this happens because the m 111 space has a closed non trivial twoform. at the

3

classical level there are no states charged with respect to such a u(1) but in non perturbative
string theory there might be. indeed this is like a ramond-ramond multiplet. it is still an
open problem to determine the twelvedimensional special kahler manifold:

whose geometry determines the n = 2 low energy supergravity action for the ads4  m 111
compactication.

1.2 the results of this paper in the modern perspective of ads/cf t

correspondence

the programme of deriving the complete osp(2|4)  su(3)  su(2)) spectrum was left un-
achieved in 1984 since the hopes to obtain a realistic kaluza klein model were doomed. indeed
not only was the theory plagued by a too large cosmological constant (anti de sitter space) and
by an intrinsic non chiral nature, but also the quark and lepton representations could not be
found in the hypermultiplet spectrum [36]. the harmonic analysis had been carried through
to the point of determining the spectrum of graviton and gravitino multiplets (see [8]) but in
order to derive the spectrum of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets a major eort was still
necessary. indeed one needed to nd the eigenvalues of the laplace beltrami operators:

m(1)(0)2

, m(1)2(0)

, m(1)3

(1.5)

acting respectively on 1forms, 2forms and 3forms.

the spectra of these eigenvalues is precisely what we determine in the present paper and
this information combined with the old results allows us to organize all the kaluza klein states
in osp(2|4) supermultiplets. indeed as a by product of our analysis we also nd the structure
of short and long uir representations of the superalgebra osp(2|4) limited by highest spin less
or equal to two. in other words the path we follow here is somehow the reciprocal path to that
followed by gunaydin and warner in the case of the round s7. there representation theory
of the non compact superalgebra osp(8|4) could be used to retrieve all the data inherent to
harmonic analysis on s7. here full edged harmonic analysis on m 111, besides giving detailed
information on the energy labels of the supermultiplets, determines also the structure of the
uir of the noncompact superalgebra osp(2|4). obviously such a structure is universal and
must be the same in the other n = 2 compactications. what will be dierent in the other
cases is the g group and the g representation assignment of the supermultiplets. similarly,
for long multiplets, but not for short multiplets we will have dierent values of the energy labels
(anomalous conformal dimensions in the three dimensional scft interpretation). according
to the castellani et al classication (see [9] for a summary in modern perspective) there are
just three n = 2 theories in this setup and they correspond to the cases,

m ppr
v5,2
qppp

; g = su(3)  su(2)
; g = so(5)
; g = su(2)3

4

(1.6)

the rst manifold is treated in the present paper. the spectrum of the stiefel manifold v5,2
is presently under construction and will appear in a forthcoming publication [1]. as for the
last case qppp, originally introduced by r. dauria, p. fre and van nieuwenhuizen [37], in
this case there already exists a proposal for the dual superconformal eld theory [11]. if the
osp(2|4)  su(2)3 spectrum had been determined the conjectured ads/cf t correspondence
could be tested. unfortunately the harmonic analysis on q111 is not yet available and has still
to be planned.

hence the present paper is a rst essential step along a path that we outline in the outlook

at the end of the paper.

1.3 structure of the paper

our paper is divided in two parts. in the rst we give a summary of our result, namely we
present the full spectrum of osp(2|4)  su(3)  su(2) supermultiplets while in the second
part we give all the details of its derivation from systematic harmonic analysis on m 111. the
rst part is written in such a way as to be self-consistent. the reader interested only in the
spectrum but not in harmonic analysis can completely skip part two. more specically the
content of the sections is as follows.

section two describes the structure of osp(2|4) supermultiplets from a general stand point.
section three presents the spectrum of osp(2|4) supermultiplets that occur in the m 111
compactications giving their su(3) su(2)-quantum numbers. the multiplets are divided in
three classes: long, short and massless and for each class we have graviton, gravitino and vector
multiplets. the hypermultiplets are always short. there are no massless gravitino multiplets
because this would mean that supersymmetry is enhanced from n = 2 to higher n , which is
not the case.

section four describes the geometry of the m 111 space.
section ve introduces the basic items of harmonic analysis and applies them to the space

under consideration.

section six explains how to derive the eigenvalues of the laplace-beltrami operators relevant
to our problem from harmonic analysis. the section is divided in subsections dealing with the
laplace-beltrami operators acting on zero-forms, one-forms, two-forms, three-forms and spinors
respectively.

supermultiplets.

section seven is devoted to lling the various states found by harmonic analysis into osp(2|4)
section eight gives an outlook on the continuation of our research project and future devel-

opments.

appendix a contains our conventions while appendix b summarizes, for the reader conve-
nience, the main formulas on harmonic analysis and mass relations that we use throughout the
paper.

5

part one: the result

in this part of the article we present our result while in the second part we give all the

details of its derivation.

specically, in part two we shall give a summary of m 111 geometry and a full edged discus-
sion of harmonic analysis on such a manifold. in that part the interested reader can nd all the
details concerning the calculation of the eigenvalue spectra for the operators m(1)(0)2 , m(1)2(0)
and m(1)3 [6, 39] which are the key tool to obtain the complete spectrum of supermultiplets.
yet the reader whose interest is limited to the actual form of this spectrum can just conne his
reading to part one.

here we give the result in two steps. in the rst step we present the structure of long and
short multiplets of the osp (2|4) superalgebra that are limited by highest spin less or equal to
two. such a structure could have been derived either by means of the freedman nicolai method
of vanishing norms [40], or by the gunaydin et warner oscillator method [26]. we bypass such
calculations obtaining the result as a byproduct of harmonic analysis on the specic manifold
m 111. yet we emphasize (as we did in the introduction) that this part of the result is universal
and applies to all other n = 2 compactications on ads4. in the second step we exactly specify
how many long and short osp (2|4) multiplets occur in the m 111 compactication and for each
of them we give both the su (3)su (2) representation assignment and the value of the energy
and hypercharge labels (e0, y0) of the corresponding cliord vacuum.

2 structure of the osp (2|4) multiplets
the structure of the relevant n = 2 supermultiplets in ads4 superspace is summarized in tables
1,2, 3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9 whose content we discuss in the present section. to describe the organization
of these tables we recall the basic facts about osp (2|4) unitary irreducible representations
(uir).

the even subalgebra of the superalgebra:

geven = sp (4, ir)  so (2)  osp (2|4)

(2.1)

is a direct sum of subalgebras, where sp (4, ir)  so (2, 3) is the isometry algebra of ads4 while
the compact subalgebra so (2) generates rsymmetry. the maximally compact subalgebra of
geven is

gcompact = so (2)e  so (3)s  so (2)r  geven.

(2.2)
the generator of so (2)e is interpreted as the hamiltonian of the system when osp (2|4) acts as
the isometry group of anti de sitter superspace. consequently its eigenvalues e are the energy
levels of possible states for the system. the group so (3)s is the ordinary rotation group and
similarly its representation labels s describe the possible spin states of the system. finally the
eigenvalue y of the generator of so (2)r is the hypercharge of a state.

a supermultiplet, namely a uir of the superalgebra osp (2|4) is composed of a nite number
of uir of the even subalgebra geven (2.1), each of them being what in physical language we

6

call a particle state, characterized by a spin s, a mass m and a hypercharge y. from a
mathematical viewpoint each uir representation of the non-compact even subalgebra geven is
an innite tower of nite dimensional uir representations of the compact subalgebra gcompact
(2.2). the lowest lying representation of such a tower |e, s, y > is the cliord vacuum, the
mass, spin and hypercharge of the corresponding particle are read from the labels of the cliord
vacuum by use of the relations between mass and energy [8] that we have recalled in appendix
b eq. (b.7).

in the same way there is a cliord vacuum |e0, s0, y0 > for the entire supermultiplet out
of which we not only construct the corresponding particle state but also, through the action of
the susy charges, we construct the cliord vacua |e0 + . . . , s0 + . . . , y0 + . . . > of the other
members of the same supermultiplet. hence the structure of a supermultiplet is conveniently
described by listing the energy e, the spin s and the hypercharge y of all the cliord vacua of
the multiplet.

in tables 1,2, 3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9 we provide such information in the rst three columns. the
remaining columns provide additional information concerning the way the abstract osp (2|4)
supermultiplets are actually realized in kaluza klein supergravity.
indeed for each particle
state appearing in the supermultiplet we write the name of the corresponding eld in the
kaluza klein expansion of d = 11 supergravity to which such a particle state contributes. the
standard expansion of linearized d = 11 supergravity and the conventions for the names of the
d = 4 elds are given in appendix b, eq. (b.1).

multiplets with s  2.

given these preliminaries let us discuss our result for the structure of the osp (2|4) super-
in n extended ads4 superspace there are three kinds of supermultiplets:
 the long multiplets
 the short multiplets
 the massless multiplets

for n = 2 the long multiplets satisfy the following unitarity relation, without saturation:

e0 > |y0| + s0 + 1.

(2.3)

furthermore we distinguish three kinds of long multiplets depending on the highest spin state
they contain: smax = 2, 3
2, 1. these multiplets are respectively named long graviton, long
gravitino and long vector multiplets.

the long graviton multiplet, satisfying e0 > |y0| + 2, has the structure displayed in table 1.
the long gravitino multiplet, satisfying e0 > |y0| + 3
2, has the structure displayed in table
2. as we see this type of multiplet is realized in kaluza klein supergravity in two dierent
ways. the two ways correspond to a resolution of the ambiguity inherent to the quadratic
form of the mass/energy relations (b.7). one realization of the multiplets chooses one branch
of the relation, the second realization chooses the second branch. the two realizations of the
multiplets are implemented by dierent elds of the kaluza klein expansion. for instance in
one realization the vector elds (z) arise from the expansion of the threeform aij (with one

table 6: n = 2 short vector multiplet a with positive hypercharge y0 > 0

we must stress that the multiplets displayed in tables 4, 5, 6 are only half of the story,
since they can be viewed as the bps states where e0 = y0 + s0 + 1 and y0 > 0. in addition
one has also the anti bps states. these are the short multiplets where e0 = y0 + s0 + 1 with
y0 < 0. the structure of these anti short multiplets can be easily read o from tables 4, 5, 6
by reversing the sign of all hypercharges.

the hypermultiplet, satisfying e0 = |y0|  1

2, has the structure displayed in table 7. this
structure is dierent from the others because this multiplet is complex. this means that for
each eld there is another eld with same energy and spin but opposite hypercharge. so it is
built with two n = 1 wess-zumino multiplets. the four real scalar eld can be arranged into
a quaternionic complex form.
the massless multiplets are either short graviton or short vector multiplets satisfying the

further condition

e0 = s0 + 1

equivalent to y0 = 0.

(2.6)

table 8.

the massless vector multiplet, satisfying e0 = 1 y0 = 0, has the structure displayed in
table 9. these are the n = 2 supermultiplets in anti de sitter space that can occur in kaluza
klein supergravity.
the structure of the long multiplets was derived in the eighties (see [8]), whereas the struc-
ture of the short and massless multiplets we have given here, is, to the best of our knowledge, a
new result that we have obtained as a byproduct of harmonic analysis on m 111. in establishing
our result we have also used as a tool the necessary decomposition of the n = 2 multiplets into
n = 1 multiplets (see figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) for long and short multiplets. finally we note
that the structure of massless multiplets is identical in the anti de sitter and in the poincare
case, as it is well known.

this is all the information that we can have on the multiplets from superalgebra theory.
the determination of the actual spectrum by harmonic analysis teaches us a lot more: indeed
we nd out which multiplets are present for each representation of g, how many they are, and
the exact value of the e0 label for each multiplet. so, at the end we know the energy of every
eld in the multiplets. in the dual superconformal eld theory on the twobrane these are the
conformal dimensions of the primary operators. in addition we nd also the hypercharge of
each multiplet in the spectrum.

3 the complete spectrum of osp(2|4) su (3) su (2) su-

permultiplets

as stressed in the introduction the irreducible supermultiplets of osp (2|4) occur into irreducible
representations of the bosonic group

g = su (3)  su (2) ,

whose interpretation is the avor group in the conformal eld theory side of the correspondence
and it is the gauge group in the supergravity side.
in any case the crucial information one
needs to extract from harmonic analysis is precisely the g representation assignment of the
supermultiplets and the actual value of e0 and y0.

to present our result, we rst need to x our conventions for labelling the irreducible
representations of g. it has rank three, so that its irreducible representations are labeled by
three integer numbers. a representation of su (3) can be identied by a young diagram of the
following type

  
  
{z

m2

|

  
{z

m1

,

}

while an irreducible representation of su (2) can be described by a young diagram as follows

|

}
  
{z

2j

|

.

}

hence we can take the nonnegative integers m1, m2, 2j, as the labels of a g irreducible
representation.

relying on the procedures explained in the following sections and originally introduced in

[5], we have found the following result.

not every g representation is actually present, but only those representations that satisfy

the following relations

(3.1)
in the following pages, for each type of n = 2 multiplet we list the g representations through
which it occurs in the spectrum. we do this by writing bounds on the range of values for the
m1, m2, 2j labels. the reader should take into account that, case by case, in addition to the
specic bounds we write, also the general restriction (3.1) ) is to be imposed.

m2  m1  3 zz ;

j  in.

furthermore for every multiplet, we give the energy and hypercharge values e0 and y0 of
the cliord vacuum. from the tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 it is straightforward to get the
energies and the hypercharges of all other elds in each multiplet.

as a shorthand notation let us name h0 the following quadratic form in the representation

labels:

h0 

64
3

(m2 + m1 + m2m1) + 32j (j + 1) +

32
9

(m2  m1)2 .

(3.2)

14

up to multiplicative constants, the rst two addends m2 + m1 + m2 m1 and j(j + 1) are the
casimirs of g = su(3)  su(2). the last addendum is contributed by the square of the
hypercharge through its relation with the su(3) representation implied by the geometry of the
space.

conjugate representation .

and is due to the existence of one closed cohomology twoform on the m 111 manifold.
this multiplet is named the betti multiplet.

summarizing, the massless spectrum, besides the supergravity multiplet contains twelve
vector multiplets: so the total number of massless gauge bosons is thirteen, one of them being
the graviphoton. in the low energy eective lagrangian we just couple to supergravity these
twelve vector multiplets. however we expect the gauging of a thirteenparameter group:

su (3)  su (2)  u(1)r  u (1)

(3.44)

the further u (1) being associated with the betti multiplet. all kaluza klein states are neutral
under u (1) yet non perturbative states might carry u(1) charges. this is a completely open
problem.

part two: the derivation

in the second part of the paper we give the detailed derivation of the results presented in

the rst part. our main tools in this derivation are:

 harmonic analysis on g
by dauria and fr`e [5, 6]

h sevendimensional coset manifolds as developed in the eighties

 the general diagonalization of linearized d = 11 supergravity eld equations and the
resulting massformulae derived by dauria and fr`e [5] and by castellani et al [41] also
in the eighties

 the mass relations following from the existence of killing spinors on g

h derived by dauria

and fr`e in [6]

 the structure of n = 2 long multiplets that were obtained in [40, 8].

we begin with a review of m 111 dierential geometry.

4 the dierential geometry of m 111

let us briey review the essential features of m 111 geometry. for notations and basic lore we
mainly refer to [4, 5, 39].

the homogeneous space m 111 is the quotient of g = su(3) su(2) u(1) by the action of
its subgroup h = su(2)c u(1) u(1), where the embedding of h in g is dened as follows.
su(2)c 2 is the isospin su (2) subgroup of su (3) with respect to which the fundamental triplet
representation branches as follows:

3  2  1.

(4.1)

(4.2)

the additional u(1) and u(1) factors of the h subgroup are generated by z and z being two
independent linear combinations of the three remaining abelian generators of su (3)su (2)
u (1) commuting with su (2)c. using the gellmann matrices for su (3) and the pauli matrices
for su (2) (see appendix a for conventions) these three generators are
2i3, and iy...
3.
the two linear combinations z and z are dened as a basis for the orthogonal complement
of the generator

3
2 i8, 1

z = p

3
2 i8 + 1

2qi3 + riy...
3

with p = q = r = 1

2the superscript c stands for color. this nomenclature is due to the original interest in the group g as the
gauge group of the gsw standard model. even if this perspective has faded, the terminology is still useful.
so we will label quantities referring to su (3) with the index c, and quantities referring to the weak isospin
su (2) 6 su (3) with w.

20

which belongs to ik rather than ih in the decomposition of the su (3)  su (2)  u (1) lie
algebra

in the above equations i38 is the hypercharge generator of su(3), 1

2i3 is the third

component of the weak isospin and iy...

3 is the weak u(1) generator.

an explicit representation of the group g is given by the following 6  6 blockdiagonal

matrix:

g = ih  ik
g = su (3)  su (2)  u (1)
ih = su (2)  u (1)  u (1)

where the diagonal blocks contain the fundamental representation of su(3), su(2) and u(1)
respectively. the whole set of generators of g is given by:

a basis for the two abelian generators of h can is given by

which are orthogonal among themselves and with z:

t r(zz) = t r(zz) = t r(zz) = 0 .

21

an explicit parametrization of the coset g/h is given by the seven coordinates (ya, ym, y3):

l(ya, ym, y3) = exp( 1

2iaya) exp( 1

2 imym) exp(zy3) .

from this we can construct the left-invariant one-forms on g/h as:

(y) = l1(y)dl(y) = (y)t ,

which satisfy the maurer-cartan equations

d + 1

the one-forms  can be separated into a set {h} corresponding to the generators of the
subalgebra ih and a set {} corresponding to the coset generators. these latter can be
identied with the su(3)  su(2)  u(1) invariant seven-vielbeins on g/h:

where the multiplicative coecients in front of the vielbeins have been properly chosen to let
the metric on g/h be einstein. the invariant forms h are:

5 harmonic analysis on m 111

in this section we summarize the essential ideas concerning the techniques of harmonic analysis
on homogeneous sevenmanifolds originally developed in [5, 6]. these techniques are the basic
ingredient of our calculations and in the present summary we present them already applied to
the specic case of the m 111 manifold.

the essential goal of harmonic analysis, is that of translating a dierential equation problem
in the present case, the dierential
into a linear algebraic one, by means of group theory.
equations to solve are the linearized eld equations of kaluza klein supergravity, whose typical
form is:

where [j1j2]
[123](x, y) is a eld transforming in the irreducible representations [j1j2] of so(3, 2)
and [123] of so(7), and depends both on the coordinates x of anti-de sitter space and
on the coordinates y of g/h. 2[j1j2]
is the kinetic operator for a eld of spin [j1j2] in four
is the kinetic operator for a eld of spin [123] in seven dimensions.
dimension while
now, the harmonics constitute a complete set of functions for the expansion of any so(7)-
irreducible eld over g/h, y i
[123](y). but their most important property is that they trans-
form irreducibly under g, the group of isometries of the coset space. this group acts on
y i
[123](y) through the so-called covariant lie derivative (see eq.(2.25) of [5]):

[123]
y

x

y i

[123](y) := ly i

[123](y),

which satisfy the lie algebra of the group g:

[l,l] = c

l.

moreover, the operators l commute with the so(7) covariant derivative:

ldy i = dly i ,

where d is dened by

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

d = d + bt,

(5.5)
and (t)i
j are the generators of the so(7) irreducible representation [123] of y i (e.g.
(t) = 
an important thing to note is that h = su(2)  u(1)  u(1) is necessarily a subgroup of
so(7), whose natural embedding is given in terms of the following embedding of the algebra
ih into the adjoint representation of so(7):

 for the vector representation).

(5.8)

this means that the so(7)-indices of the various n-forms can be split in the following subsets,
each one transforming into an irreducible representation of h:

y  = {y a,y m,y 3}
y [] = {y ab,y am,y mn,y a3,y m3}
y [] = {y abc,y abm,y ab3,y amn,y am3,y mn3}

(5.9)

and the so(7) irreducible representations [123] break into the direct sum of h irreducible
representations. let us then introduce some notation for the harmonics of m 111, which will be
denoted by h.

a generic so(3, 2)h-irreducible eld can be expanded as follows:

[j1j2]

[j cz z ]i1i2j c (x, y) =x

[m1m2j y ]x xm h[m1m2j y ]m

[j cz z ]i1i2j c (y)  [j1j2]

[m1m2j y ]m(x)

(5.10)

the coecients (x) of the expansion will become the spacetime elds of the theory in ads4.
the rst sum is over all the g irreducible representations [m1m2j y ] which break into the

given h-one. we call p the sum over this subset of the possible representations of g. the
subscripts i1,,i2j c span the representation space of [j czz], while m is a collective index which
spans the representation space of [m1m2j y ]. finally  accounts for the fact that the same h
irreducible representation can be embedded in g in dierent ways. the cases of interest for us
will be the following:

5.1 the constraints on the irreducible representations

as we have seen in eq. (5.10), the expansion of a generic eld contains only the harmonics
whose h- and g-quantum numbers are such that the g representation, decomposed under h,
contain the h representation of the eld. this fact poses some constraints on the g-quantum
numbers.

depending on which constraints are satised by a certain g representation, only part of
the harmonics is present, and only their corresponding fourdimensional elds appear in the
spectrum. then, in the g representations in which such eld disappear, there is multiplet
shortening. in the modern perspective of kaluza klein theory, the exact spectrum of the short
multiplets is crucial. hence the importance of analyzing this disappearance of harmonics with
care.

every harmonic is dened by its su (2)  u (1)  u (1) representation, identied by the
labels [j c z z]. substituting these values in equations (4.9), (4.10), (5.11), (5.12), we can
determine the constraints on the g representations.

the rst constraint gives the value of y in terms of m1 and m2. we have ve possible
expressions of y , identifying ve families of g representations which we will denote with the
superscripts 0, +, , ++ and :

0 :
++ :
 :
+ :
 :

y = 2/3(m2  m1)
y = 2/3(m2  m1)  2
y = 2/3(m2  m1) + 2
y = 2/3(m2  m1)  1


y = 2/3(m2  m1) + 1 )

for bosonic

elds

for fermionic

elds

(5.13)

it is worth noting that the value of y identies a u (1)r representation, so these ve families
of representations correspond to the ve possible representations of u (1)r.

a second constraint is the lower bound on the quantum number j, since the third component

of the weak isospin, j3, is linked to y . we have three possibilities:

j 

|y /2|
|y /2 + 1|
|y /2  1|

when some of the (5.15) constraints are not satised, the young tableau (see (5.11), (5.12) )
corresponding to  in (5.15) does not exist.

we organize the series of the g = g  u (1)r representations in the following way. the
constraints (5.14) and (5.15), with the ve values of y in terms of m1, m2 given by (5.13), dene
the series of g representations that we list in table 10. every g representation, together with
a superscript 0, +, , ++ or  that dene the value of y , is a g representation. so the series
of g representations dened in table 10 with such a superscript are series of representations of
the whole g group.

for each family of representations (0, +, , ++, and ) we will call a series regular if it
contains the maximum number of harmonics. the regular series cover all the representations
with m1, m2 and j suciently high to satisfy all the inequality constraints. when some of these
inequalities are not satised instead, some of the harmonics may be absent in the expansion.

in tables 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, we show which harmonics are present for the dierent series
of g representations. the rst column contains the name of each series. the other columns
contain the possible harmonics, each labeled by its h-quantum numbers. an asterisk denotes
the presence of a given harmonic. to obtain the constraints on the conjugate series it suces
to exchange m1 and m2, as explained in [5, 39].

6 dierential calculus via harmonic analysis

[123]
the kaluza klein kinetic operators
y
implies that they are so(7)-invariant:

are covariant dierential operators. eq. (5.4) then

l

[123]
y

= [123]

y

l.

(6.1)

using this fact and schurs lemma we conclude that they act irreducibly on the harmonics.
in other words they act as (nite dimensional) matrices on the harmonic subspaces of xed
g-quantum numbers:

[123]
y

h[m1m2j y ]



(y) = m ([m1m2j y ])  

 h[m1m2j y ]

 

(y)

(6.2)

where, for short, we have summarized with  the whole set of indices labelling the h represen-
tations of h.
let us now consider the explicit action of the covariant derivative (5.5) on the harmonics.
following to the standard procedures of harmonic analysis [5, 6], h is a subgroup of so(7).
the so(7)covariant derivative (5.5) can then be decomposed as:
d = d + hth + bim  dh + bim ,

(6.3)

where th are the generators of h and im the part of the so(7)-connection not belonging to
h. the im generators in the fundamental so(7) representation acquire the following form:

the harmonics transform as the inverse l1(y) of the fundamental elements of g (see [5]). eq.
(4.14) can be restated as

from which we deduce that

l1 = l1dl l1 = dl1

dhh = (d + hth )h = th.

(6.4)

(6.5)

by means of eq. (4.16) we can calculate the explicit components of dh, i.e.
along the vielbeins:

its projection

dh = bdh

 = t,
da =  43ia,
dm =  42
im,
d3 =  4
3z,



(6.6)

where the coset generators t act on h as follows. a acts on the su(3) part of the g repre-
sentation of the harmonic. the fundamental representation of a is given by the gellmann
matrices (see appendix a). on a generic young tableau a acts as the tensor representation.
to give an example, consider a component of an harmonic with su(3) indices given by

1 1 3 3
2 3

.

then 4, which exchanges 1 with 3, acts as follows:

4

1 1 3 3
2 3

=

=

3 1 3 3

=

=

3 1 3 3
2 3

+ 2

1 1 1 3
2 3

.

similarly, m (m = {1, 2}) acts as the m-th pauli matrix on the fundamental representation of
su(2), and as its n-th tensor power on the n-boxes su(2) young tableau:

1 1 1 1 2 2 = 3 1 1 2 2 2 + 2 1 1 1 1 2 .

31

finally, z acts trivially, multiplying h by its z-charge:

z

 1 1 1 2 2 =

=(cid:18)

(6.8)

where 2j = m1 + m2 and 2j 3 = m1  m2. the complete kaluza klein mass operator heavily
depends on the kind of eld it acts on and will be analyzed in details in the next sections.

6.1 the zero-form

the only representation into which the [0, 0, 0] (i.e. the scalar) of so(7) breaks under h, is ob-
viously the h-scalar representation. the question now is: which g-irreducible representations
contain the h-scalar? from equations (4.9),(4.10) we see that z = z = 0 implies

2j3 = y =

2
3

(m2  m1) .

(6.9)

this means that

 m2  m1  3zz
 j  in

 j (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 1

3 (m2  m1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

32

 y = 2

3 (m2  m1).

we will denote the scalar as

y = [0|i] x

[m1m2j y ]h[m1m2jy ]

[000]

(y)  s[m1m2y j](x).

the kaluza klein mass operator for the zero-form y is given by
 dhy.

[000]y  ddy = dh

(6.10)

(6.11)

for the scalar, there are no imconnection terms. so, by means of eq. (6.7), the computation
of its eigenvalues, on the grepresentations as listed above, is immediate:

[000]y  m(0)3y = h 64
= h0y

3 (m1 + m2 + m1m2) + 32j(j + 1) + 32

9 (m2  m1)2iy =

(6.12)

where h0 is the same quantity dened in eq. (3.2).

as we see from the kaluza klein expansion (b.1), the eigenvalues of the zeroform harmonic
allow us to determine (see [6]) the masses of the ads4 graviton eld h and the scalar elds s, .

6.2 the one-form

the decomposition under h of the vector representation of so(7) is the following 3:

[1, 0, 0]  [0, 0, 0]  [0,2i,3i]  [0, 2i, 3i]  [ 1

2, 3i, 3

2i]  [ 1

2 ,3i, 3

2i].

(6.13)

concretely, the decomposition of the oneform in hirreducible fragments is done as follows
(see also [7]):

y a = a
y m = m
y 3 = [1, i]

3ih1|iii + a
21h1|ii. + m

i3h1|iii
12h1|ii.

(6.14)
(6.15)
(6.16)

these hirreducible fragments can be expanded as in (5.10) 4 (summation over the g-quantum
numbers is intended):

for type

0 :

i

j

h1|iii = h[1/2,3i,3i/2](a)
 wh 1
2, ii ,
h1|iii = ijh[1/2,3i,3i/2](b)
 fwh 1
h1|ii = h[0,2i,3i]  wh0, ii ,
= h[0,2i,3i]  fwh0, ii ,
h1|ii

[1|i] = h[0,0,0]  w [0, i] ,

2, ii ,

(6.17)
3when we write a pair of complex conjugate representations we assume a conjugation relation between them.
for example, by writing [0,2i,3i]  [0, 2i, 3i] we intend a complex representation of complex dimension one
or real dimension two.
4using the same conventions as in [5, 6, 39, 7], the reader might notice that there appears a sign (1)jj3
upon taking the complex conjugate of the fragments h. . .| . . .ix. in order to reduce the notation we have absorbed

this sign in the xspace elds fwh. . . , . . .i. this will be done for all the complex conjugates henceforth.

33

for type ++ :

h1|iii = h[1/2,3i,3/2i](b)

i

 wh 1

2, iii ,

for type  :

h1|iii = ijh[1/2,3i,3/2i](a)

j

2, iii .

 fwh 1

as we see, there are ve dierent ads4 elds (w,fw ) in the case of the 0 series, and one eld
in the case of the ++ and  series. so, for the regular 0 series the laplace beltrami operator
acts on the ads4 elds as a 5 5 matrix. for the exceptional series it acts as a matrix of lower
dimension.

the laplace beltrami operator for the transverse one-form eld y , is given by

[100]y   m(1)(0)2y  = 2dd[y ] = (dd + 24)y  ,

(6.18)

it coincides with m(1)(0)2 when acting on a transverse one-form. but on a generic y , which
possibly contains a longitudinal term, the second part of (6.22), ddy , is not inert. indeed,
let us suppose

for some scalar function y. then

y  = dy

ddy  = dddy = dm(0)3y = m(0)3y .

(6.23)

so, our actual operator (6.20) contains the eigenvalues of m(0)3, which are longitudinal (hence
non-physical ) for the oneform. this fact is true also for the two-form.

the eigenvalue 3 in (6.21) is the longitudinal one, equal to the zeroform eigenvalue h0.

the other four, instead, are transverse physical eigenvalues.

the matrices corresponding to the exceptional series are easily obtained from (6.20) by
removing the rows and the columns of the elds that disappear in the expansions (6.17), as we
read from table 11. we list the mass eigenvalues of each series:

7 matching the spectrum with the osp(2|4) multiplets
as already mentioned, the structure of the long multiplets that arise from n = 2 compact-
ications of elevendimensional supergravity in ads4 has already been presented in [8]. the
structure and the g representations of the long graviton multiplet, the long gravitino mul-
tiplets and the massless multiplets are known since the eighties [8]. however this is not the
case for the long vector multiplets and for the short multiplets, due to the fact that the cru-
cial knowledge of the eigenvalues of the operators (1.5) was lacking. in this section we match
the complete spectrum that we have calculated with the multiplets as they are already known
from old literature. furthermore, while doing this we also nd the short n = 2 multiplets as
truncations of the long multiplets that were already known.
in order to achieve this we use a procedure of exhaustion, i.e. one starts with one of the
four dierent types of multiplets for which all the masses of a certain eld component are most
easily retrieved (this is for instance the case for the graviton eld of the graviton multiplet)
and using the mass relations of [6] (see also appendix b), one calculates all the masses of the
other types of elds present in the multiplet. one uses also the information that all the elds
in a multiplet are in the same irreducible g = su (3)  su (2) representation and that their
hypercharges are related according to the group theoretical structure of the multiplets shown
in tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. so one knows in which g representation to nd the other elds
of the multiplet, whose masses have been determined. then, upon using the relations (b.3),
these masses are compared with the eigenvalues of the invariant operators on the spinor, the
oneform, the twoform or the threeform depending on the type of eld one is considering.
the upshot of this is that some of these eigenvalues yield all the masses obtained from the
mass relations. however, the remaining eigenvalues signal the existence of some extra masses
which then pertain to other elds that are to be found in other multiplets. in this way one
establishes the existence of new unknown multiplets and determines their structure by lling
out their eld content. after repeatedly applying this procedure one will have lled out all the
existing multiplets in the spectrum.

we should remark here that we did not calculate the eigenvalues of the lichnerowicz and
raritaschwinger operators m(2)(0)2 and m(3/2)(1/2)2 . however we succeeded in nding the
complete multiplet structure without making use of this. the ads4 elds whose spectrum is
determined by m(2)(0)2 and m(3/2)(1/2)2 are the scalar eld  and the transverse spinor eld t
(see (b.1). we can ll the multiplets without knowing the spectrum of these two elds with
the help of the n = 2  n = 1 decompositions (see pictures 1,2,3, 4,5,6,7). every theory
with n = 2 supersymmetry also has n = 1 supersymmetry, so every n = 2 multiplet has to

46

be decomposable in n = 1 multiplets. if we know every eld of a multiplet except for  and
t , we can deduce which  and t are present by trying to organize the n = 2 multiplet in
n = 1 multiplets. there is no ambiguity, because no n = 1 multiplet is built using  and t
elds alone. in particular, a wess zumino multiplet with one t and two  s is not allowed,
since it has to contain both a scalar and a pseudoscalar.

in practice one starts with the graviton multiplet since the masses of the graviton eld
in the dierent representations are immediate to derive, being the eigenvalues of the scalar
operator m(0)3. by means of the above procedure, one exhausts all the spin 3
2 elds in the
graviton multiplet comparing the masses of the spin 3
2 elds in the graviton multiplet with the
eigenvalues of the operator m(1/2)3 . the spin 3
2 elds that provide the remaining eigenvalues of
the operator m(1/2)3, can only be the highestspin component gravitino elds of the gravitino
multiplet and hence we know all the masses of the gravitini in the gravitino multiplet. at this
stage we can repeat the same procedure. we use the eigenvalues of the oneform operator
m(1)(0)2 to identify the vector eld a and w and we use the eigenvalues of the twoform
operator m(1)2(0) to identify the vector elds z in the graviton and the gravitino multiplet. the
remaining vector elds constitute the highestcomponent vector elds of the vector multiplet.
then we determine the masses of the longitudinal spinors, provided by the eigenvalues of the
operator m(1/2)3 , and we nd the longitudinal spinors of the gravitino and vector multiplet. the
remaining longitudinal spinors belong to hypermultiplets. at the end we determine the masses
of the scalars s, , that are provided by the eigenvalues of m(0)3, and of the pseudoscalar ,
provided by the eigenvalues of the threeform operator m(1)3. at this point, the matching of
the spectrum with the multiplets will be complete.

since we are in particular interested in multiplet shortening, it is of utmost importance to
pay attention to what happens with the eigenvalues in the exceptional series. as it is clear
from tables (6.24), (6.38), (6.42) of the eigenvalues, there are always less eigenvalues present
when the operators act on the harmonics in the exceptional series. this is reected into the
fact that certain eld components are not present in the multiplets, thus multiplet shortening.
in the next sections we give a detailed discussion of the matching of the multiplets. doing
so we show that the information that we collected about the invariant operators on the zero
form, the oneform, the twoform, the threeform and the spinor is in perfect agreement with
the group theoretical information that was already known in [8].

7.1 the graviton multiplet

as pointed out above, the graviton multiplet is the appropriate multiplet to start with.
in
particular we look at the spintwo graviton eld. the mass of the graviton is given by the
eigenvalue of the scalar operator (see eq.s (b.3):

using table (11) we nd that its harmonics can sit in all the g representations of the series

remember that the superscripts 0 mean that the hypercharge is y = 2

using the grouptheoretical information of the long graviton multiplet (see table 1) we nd

the energy and hypercharge (e0, y0) of the graviton multiplet 5

and using table 1 [8] we nd the energies and hypercharges of all the elds in the multiplet.
in particular, we see that the gravitini are in u(1)r representations +, , the a, w vectors in
u(1)r representations 0, the z vectors in u(1)r representations 0, ++, . from the mass of
the graviton we deduce, using the mass relations in appendix b, the masses of the gravitini and
vectors present in the graviton multiplet,

m = 6 qh0 + 36 ,

from equations (b.3), we predict the presence of the eigenvalues m(1/2)3 = m for the spinor.
indeed, looking at (6.46), we see that the two eigenvalues 1 and 2 come from spin 3
2 elds that
belong to the graviton multiplet. to nd out whether there are some short graviton multiplets
present in the spectrum, we now use table (6.47). the absence of these eigenvalues 1 or 2
in some of the exceptional series implies the existence of a short graviton multiplet in that
particular g series. let us look at it more closely. for instance, for a+
5 , there is none
of the eigenvalues 1 or 2. this would imply a graviton multiplet without gravitino elds. but
fortunately, the series a2 and a5 do not contain representations of g in which there is a graviton
eld, see (7.2). considering the rest of table (6.47) and also table (6.50), we nd three types
of graviton multiplets: a long graviton multiplet and two types of short graviton multiplets.
the long graviton multiplet contains four spinors : + with hypercharge y0  1 and  with
hypercharge y0  1. they are found in the g representations of ar, a1, a1, a3, a3, a6, a7.
then there is a short graviton multiplet in the series a4 and a4. from tables (6.47) and (6.50),
one sees that they contain the two + with hypercharge y0  1, but only one , i.e. for a4
we have one  with y0  1, and for a4 we have one  with y0 + 1. we also nd the massless
multiplet in a8 for which none of the spin 3
2 elds that correspond to the eigenvalues 1 and 2
in (6.46) and (6.49) sit in the graviton multiplets. however, there are also spin 3
2 elds that
yield the eigenvalues 3 and 4 in (6.46) and (6.49). they can only be gravitini of the gravitino
multiplets in the spectrum. so now we know the highest components of gravitino multiplets,
their energies, hypercharges and g representations. but before we continue with the gravitino
multiplet, let us look at the vectors of the graviton multiplet.

at this stage, we know that the spin 3

2 elds  are present.

5remember that e0, y0 denote the energy and hypercharge of the cliord vacuum of the multiplet

48

let us consider a and w rst. we know that, if present, they should be in the series (7.2).

using equations (b.3) we see that their m(1)(0)2 eigenvalues would then be

m a

m w

(1)(0)2 = h0 + 24 + 4qh0 + 36 ,
(1)(0)2 = h0 + 24  4qh0 + 36 .

(7.6)

indeed, these eigenvalues are present, namely for a we nd 4 and for w we nd 5 of eq.
(6.21). to determine whether, in the exceptional series, the vector a or the vector w is present
we use table (6.24). the absence of one of the vectors will imply shortening of the graviton
multiplet. studying the spin 3/2 elds, we have found that there are long graviton multiplets
in the series ar, a1, a1, a3, a3, a6, a7 and short graviton multiplets in the series a4, a4 . this
is conrmed here: in the former series both the a and w elds are present, in the latter only
the eld a is present. for the massless multiplet of a8 we also see that only the vector a is
present.

let us look at the vector z in the graviton multiplet. we know that the z vectors should

be in the same g representations of the graviton:

ar, a1, a1, a3, a3, a4, a4, a6, a7, a8

(7.7)

and that two z vectors should be in the series 0, one in the series ++ and one in the series
. for the operator m(1)2(0) on the twoform we predict, using eq.s (b.3), the presence the
eigenvalue,

m z

(1)2(0) = h0 + 32 .

(7.8)

indeed, it corresponds to 10 and 11 in (6.29) for the series 0, and 4 in (6.31) for series ++
(and , which are the series of the conjugate representations of ++ (m2  m1)). so we see
that for the long graviton multiplets all the vectors z are present. using the fact that

br  b4  b5  b6  b7  b8  b9  b10 = ar  a1  a1  a3  a3  a4  a6  a7,
br  b4  b5  b6  b7  b8  b9  b10 = ar  a1  a1  a3  a3  a4  a6  a7,

(7.9)

and tables (6.30) and(6.32) we nd that for the short graviton multiplets of a4 we have two
zs, one with hypercharge y and one with hypercharge y  2; for the short graviton multiplets
of a4 we have two zs, one with hypercharge y and one with hypercharge y + 2; for the massless
graviton multiplet we have no vectors z.

to determine which t elds and scalar elds  are present, we use the n = 2  n = 1
decomposition of the multiplets. we already know where t and  are located in the long
graviton multiplet from table 1, [8]. from gure 1 we see that the long n = 2 graviton multiplet
is made by four n = 1 massive multiplets: one graviton, two gravitino and a vector multiplet.
harmonic analysis teaches us that in the short graviton multiplet there are three gravitino elds
and three vector elds. the only possible structure of the short graviton multiplet is then the
one displayed in gure 4.

49

the multiplet that we have found in the representation of series a8 is in fact the massless
graviton multiplet. in this case the eld a becomes the graviphoton. the nal structure of
the short graviton multiplet and the massless graviton multiplet is displayed in tables 4 and 8
respectively.

7.2 the gravitino multiplet

as already previously explained, we know the m(1/2)3 eigenvalues and the g representations of
the spin 3
2 in the gravitino multiplet from the matching of the graviton multiplet. their masses
are given by equations (b.3),

m+ = 8 +qh0 + 16 + 32
m = 8 qh0 + 16 + 32
m+ = 8 +qh0 + 16  32
m = 8 qh0 + 16  32

3 (m2  m1) = 3
3 (m2  m1) = 4

3 (m2  m1) = 3
3 (m2  m1) = 4

(7.10)

(7.11)

for series of type + and

for series of type . each of the above four dierent eigenvalues gives rise to gravitino multiplets
of dierent types and/or in dierent g representations. now we look at tables (6.47) and (6.50)
and see that we have gravitino multiplets for the series ar and a1 . we consider the gravitino
multiplets in the series of type + only. the gravitino multiplets in the series of type  coming
from (7.11) can be obtained be taking the conjugates of the gravitino multiplets in the series
of type +.

we start with + in the series of type +. the energy and hypercharge (e0, y0) of the

gravitino multiplets are given by,

e0 = 1
2
3

y0 =

4qh0 + 16 + 32
(m2  m1)  1

3 (m2  m1)  1
2 .

(7.12)

let us look at the vectors in the gravitino multiplets. as we know from group theory (see
table 2, [8]) we should nd a vector with hypercharge y0 + 1 and energy e0 + 1
2, in the series 0.
however group theory does not tell us whether it is the vector a or the vector w . but since
we know that in series of type + we have m+  8, we can use the mass relations of appendix
b to derive,

m2

a = h0 + 32

3 (m2  m1) + 48  12qh0 + 32

3 (m2  m1) + 16

or

m2

w = m2

 + 2m + 192 .

50

(7.13)

(7.14)

we see from table 2 that it is the a vector which is present in the + gravitino multiplet and
not w . hence, comparing with the formula (b.3) in order to nd a, we expect the following
eigenvalue

m a

(1)(0)2 = h0 + 32

3 (m2  m1)

(7.15)

for the m(1)(0)2 operator. looking at table (6.21) we see that it is indeed present: 1. looking
at table (6.24) we see that it appears in the series a0
5. we also nd a vector
a with hypercharge y0  1 in series ++. indeed, using

r, a0

1, a0

2, a0

3, a0

4, a0

br  b1  b3  b4  b6  b7 = ar  a1  a2  a3  a4  a5 ,

(7.16)

we see that (7.15) is an eigenvalue of the oneform operator m(1)(0)2 in series ++ as given in
(6.25). both the spin1 elds a with y0  1 and y0 + 1 of the gravitino multiplet for + are
present and there are no other left with eigenvalue (7.15). for the vector z sector, we expect
the presence of two states with mass (using the table 1)

m2

z = h0 + 16 + 32

3 (m2  m1)  4qh0 + 16 + 32

3 (m2  m1),

(7.17)

one in the g representations of type 0, the other in the representations ++ or  (depending
on the g representation of the gravitino). the mass (7.17) corresponds to 7 in (6.29) and 3
in (6.31). from this we see that z is present except for series a5, and series b7. the series a5
and b7 have no overlap. so we conclude that we have long gravitino multiplets except if the
multiplet sits in a representation of a5 or b7. for the gravitino multiplet with + in the series
+, we now look at the mass of the scalar ,

m2

 = 16 ( 1

4qh0 + 16 + 32

3  1)( 1

4qh0 + 16 + 32

3  2)

from eq.s (b.3)) we predict the eigenvalue

(7.18)

m 

(1)3 = 1

4qh0 + 16 + 32
which we do nd as 1 in (6.37) in series a0
4 (see (6.38)) and as 1 in (6.41) in
the series b++
(see (6.42)). so none of the elds  with y0 1 and y0 + 1
is present in the short gravitino multiplets with + in the series of type + . let us now consider
the spin 1
l . looking at the expansion (b.1), we see that l appears in the expansion
of the spinor. so we can check whether it is present in the gravitino multiplet with + in the
series +. we know its mass from group theory [8],

so, from eq.s (b.3) we expect the eigenvalue

which we do nd as 4 in (6.46) in a+
present in both long and short gravitino multiplets with hypercharge y0.

r, a+

1 , a+

2 , a+

l is
in fact it has to

m+

= 8 +qh0 + 16 + 32
(1/2)3 = 8 qh0 + 16 + 32

3 (m2  m1)

(7.20)

(7.21)

be there since it provides the cliord vacuum of the representation. for the short gravitino
multiplets we have found which of the elds  and t are present by using the n = 2  n = 1
decomposition (see gures 2,5) and by calculating the norms of the states using creation and
annihilation operators [40, 8]. the result is displayed in table 5.

let us consider  for the series of type +. it has mass m from (7.10). the energy and

hypercharge (e0, y0) of the multiplet are

e0 = 1
2
3

y0 =

4qh0 + 16 + 32
(m2  m1)  1 .

3 (m2  m1) + 3
2 .

we now have m  8. so, using the mass relations for w we nd

m2

w = h0 + 32

3 (m2  m1) + 48 + 12qh0 + 32

3 (m2  m1) + 16 .

(7.22)

(7.23)

thus in this case it is w that is present and not a. we nd the same eigenvalue (7.15), so we
conclude that w is present in all types of gravitino multiplets with  in series of type +. for
z we have

m2

z = h0 + 16 + 32

3 (m2  m1) + 4qh0 + 16 + 32

3 (m2  m1)

(7.24)

which, according to eq.s (b.3), has to be an eigenvalue of the twoform mass operator. indeed,
for series of type 0 it corresponds to 6, which is present in series ar, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5 (see
(6.30)). notice that these are the same series of representations as the ones in which we found
+. for the series ++ we nd 2, which is present in the series br, b1, b3, b4, b6, b7 (see
(6.32)), which are again the same series of representations as for +. the elds  present have
mass,

m2
 = 16 ( 1

4qh0 + 16 + 32

3 (m2  m1)  1)( 1

4qh0 + 16 + 32

3 (m2  m1)  2)

so we predict the eigenvalue

m 

(1)3 =  1

4qh0 + 16 + 32

3 (m2  m1)

(7.25)

(7.26)

indeed it is 3 in (6.37), present in the series ar, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5 (6.38) and 2 in (6.42),
present in the series br, b1, b3, b4, b6, b7 (6.41). we conclude that all the gravitino multiplets
with  are long gravitino multiplets.

7.3 the vector multiplet

what are the vector eld we have been left with? they have to be the highest components
of the vector multiplets. well, we have a multiplet with highest component vector a with
eigenvalue 5 in (6.21). we have a vector multiplet with highest vector component w with
eigenvalue 4 in (6.21). we have some vector multiplets with highest vector component z with

52

eigenvalues 3 in (6.29), 5 in (6.31) and 5 in the series . all these eigenvalues give rise to
the existence of dierent types of vector multiplets in dierent representations of g.

let us start with a. we call this the avector multiplet. it has eigenvalue 5 in (6.21). its

energy and hypercharge are

e0 = 1
2
3

y0 =

4qh0 + 36  3
(m2  m1)

2

and the mass of the eld component a is

(7.27)

(7.28)

(7.29)

this eigenvalue is present in the series a0
7. we now gure out for which
of these there is shortening. from the table in [8] we see that  has the same mass as a (7.28),
and using eq.s (b.3) we conclude that we should nd the eigenvalues

3 , a0

1 , a0

1, a0

r, a0

6, a0

7 (6.37) (6.38).

which is present: 5 in a0
it is also present as 3 in
b++
, b++
(6.41) (6.42). considering (7.9) this seems strange at rst
sight. however, what happens is that here we discover a scalar  in the series a4 of a hypermulti-
plet. we can see this as follows. suppose the eigenvalue were also present in series b8 and series
b10. then the eigenvalue 3 would appear in the representations of b that are on the righthand
side of (7.9). so we would nd the eld  in the g representations ar, a1, a1, a3, a3, a6, a7
and in a4, with y = 2
3(m2  m1)  2. the series a4 and b8 and b10 have no overlap. con-
sequently, the  in a4 can not belong to the avector multiplet and thus has to be a scalar
of a hypermultiplet. similarly, we nd  in br , b
, b
, b
.
6
with the same reasoning, we conclude that  in a4 with y = 2
3 (m2  m1) + 2 has to be a
scalar of some hypermultiplet. however, 3 does not sit in the series b8, b8, b10, b10. so we
conclude that that we get shortening in these series. now we get dierent types of short vector
multiplets. this is due to fact the b8 and b8 have overlap, namely if m1 = m2 = 1, j = 0 and
that also b10 and b10 have overlap, namely for the representation m1 = m2 = 0, j = 1. for
the representations in the series b8 and b10 with m1 > m2 = 1, we nd that the eld  with
hypercharge y  2 in the long vector multiplet decouples. the representations

m1 = m2,

j = 1
m1 = m2 = 1, j = 0

(7.30)

yield massless vector multiplets. they contain the vectors that gauge su(2) and su(3) respec-
tively.

let us now gure out whether we can learn something about the presence of , s and  in

the avector multiplet. the table in [8] gives the mass,

m2

,s/ = 16 e0(e0 + 1) = h0 + 48  4qh0 + 36 .

53

(7.31)

looking at eq.s (b.3), we see that the entry in the table can not be s or , but has to be . if
we look at the other , s/ in the table with mass

m2

,s/ = 16 (e0  2)(e0  1) = h0 + 176  24qh0 + 36 ,

(7.32)

we see that it is the mass for the eld s. so at this place in the table we nd the eld s. the
eld s is found in the series a0
8. so it is always present
in the avector multiplets. besides, we get some extra selds that are to be put in the
hypermultiplets in the series a4, a4, a8.

4, a04 , a0

r, a0

7, a0

to conclude the discussion of the a vector multiplet, there is shortening of avector multi-
plets in series b8, b8 and b10, b10. in the representation (7.30) there are massless vector mul-
tiplets, in the other b8, b8, b10, b10 representations there are short vector multiplets. the 
and t contents of the short vector multiplets can be determined by using the n = 2  n = 1
decomposition (see pictures 3,6). the structure of the long vector multiplet and the short
vector multiplet is displayed in table 3 and 6 respectively.

let us now consider the vector multiplet with highest vector component w . we will call
this the w  vector multiplet. we expect eigenvalue 5 in (6.21) and (6.24), which we nd in
series a0

8. this multiplet has energy and hypercharge,

(m2  m1) ,

(7.33)

the w eld has mass

m2

w = h0 + 96 + 16qh0 + 36 .

(7.34)
4 , a0
6,
(6.41)

for the elds , we expect to nd the eigenvalues 6 in series a0
, b++

(6.42), and 4 in series br , b4

8 (6.37)(6.38), and 4 in series b++

, b10 , b11 . using

b11 = a4  a8 ,
b11 = a4  a8 ,

(7.35)

and (7.9), we see that all these 0, ++, and  series coincide. thus all the elds  in the table
of [8] are always present and we nd no elds  that have to be put in other multiplets. so
the w vector multiplet is always long. which of the elds , s/ are present? let us look at
, s/ with mass

m2

,s/ = 16 e0(e0 + 1) = h0 + 176 + 24qh0 + 36 .

(7.36)

from eq.s (b.3) we see that it is the eld  that is present in the series a0
a04 , a0
 that are to be put in the hypermultiplets. let us look at , s/ with mass

3, a03 , a0
4,
8. so this conrms that there is no shortening and we do not nd any extra elds

1, a01 , a0

r, a0

6, a0

7, a0

m2

,s/ = 16 (e0  2)(e0  1) = h0 + 48 + 8qh0 + 36 .

(7.37)

54

this can only be the eld . so we conclude that the w vector multiplets are always long
vector multiplets. and there are no scalar left that have to be put in hypermultiplets.
its
structure is displayed in table 3.

let us now look at the zvector multiplet with eigenvalue 3 in series ar, a1, a1, a6, a8

(6.29) (6.30). the multiplet has energy and hypercharge

e0 = 1

y0 =

4qh0 + 4 + 1
2 ,
(m2  m1) ,

the eld z has mass

m2

z = h0 .

what about the two elds ? let us look at  with mass

m2

 = 16 e0(e0 + 1) = h0 + 16 +qh0 + 4

from eq.s (b.3) we expect there to be 7 in (6.37). indeed, it is present in series a0
so we get shortening in the singlet representation a8. for  with mass

we nd 8 in series ar,0 a0
8. so nally, we conclude that for this type of zvector
multiplet (with 3 in (6.29)) there is shortening in series a8, which yields the massless betti
multiplet. the structure of the long zvector multiplet and the massless betti multiplet is
displayed in table 3 and 9 respectively.

1, a01 , a0

let us now look at the zvector multiplet with 5 in (6.31). it appears in series br, b1, b2

(6.32). the multiplet has energy and hypercharge

e0 = 1
2
3

y0 =

4qh0 + 64
(m2  m1)  2,

3 (m2  m1)  28 + 1

2

the eld z has mass

m2

z = h0 + 64

3 (m2  m1)  32 .

what about the presence of the elds ? for  with mass
m2
 = 16 (e0  2)(e0  1) ,

we expect the eigenvalue 5 in (6.41), which is found in the series b++
 with mass

r , b++

m2

 = 16 e0(e0 + 1) ,

(7.42)

(7.43)

(7.44)

, b++

2

(6.42). for

(7.45)

we expect 6 in (6.41), which is found in the series b++
(6.42). so we conclude
that for the zvector multiplet (with vector z with eigenvalue 5 in (6.31)), there is never
shortening. we do not nd extra scalars that are to be put in hypermultiplets either. the
structure of this long z vector multiplet is displayed in table 3.

r , b++

, b++

for the zvector multiplet with 5 in series br, b1, b2, one just takes the conjugate of the

previous results.

7.4 the hypermultiplet

after having put the scalars  in the right places in the graviton, the gravitino and the vector
multiplet, we are only left with scalars  in series a0

4 and a04 and s in series a4,0 a04 , a0
8.

so for each representation of a4 we nd a hypermultiplet with energy

containing the eld  with hypercharge y = 2

3(m2  m1)  2 and mass

and the eld s with y = 2

e0 = 1

4qh0 + 36  3

2

m2

3(m2  m1) and mass

 = h0 + 96  16qh0 + 36
s = h0 + 176  24qh0 + 36

m2

(7.46)

(7.47)

(7.48)

the scalars of this hypermultiplet are complete if we add the scalars  and s of a4, which are in
fact the complex conjugates of the scalars in a4. from the eigenvalues of the operator m(1/2)3
we nd the l necessary to ll all the hypermultiplets. the structure of the hypermultiplets is
displayed in the table 7.

in order to correctly match the elds with the multiplets, it is important to note that in
the singlet g representation m1 = m2 = j = y = 0 the scalar s is absent. this is due to
the fact that, from the kaluza klein expansion of the eleven-dimensional eld hmn (x, y), the

scalar s appears in the expressions (6qm(0)3 + 36)si (x) and d(mdn)(2+qm(0)3 + 36)si (x).
the coecient of the former, 6 qm(0)3 + 36, disappears in the singlet representation. the

latter become a pure gauge term, due to the freedom of coordinate reparametrization, being
the graviton in the singlet g representation the massless graviton.

at this point we have done the complete matching of the multiplets with the spectrum
of laplace beltrami operators.
it is reassuring that all the elds we have found have been
organized in n = 2 ads4 multiplets. an important result is that we have established the
existence of short multiplets. from the expressions of the energies and hypercharges (e0, y0)
we have found, we can easily derive that

 for all the long multiplets

e0 > |y0| + s0 + 1

 for all the short graviton, gravitino and vector multiplets

 for all the hypermultiplets

e0 = |y0| + s0 + 1

e0 = |y0| 

1
2

56

 for all the massless multiplets

e0 = s0 + 1 y0 = 0.

this conrms the algebraic lore on multiplet shortening from the literature [40, 8].

8 outlook and plan for future development

in this paper we have have constructed the complete kaluza klein spectrum of the ads4m 111
compactication, organizing it into osp(2|4) supermultiplets. as stressed in the introduction
this must be regarded both as the completion of an outstanding problem and as a rst essential
step along a further research plan that can be outlined as follows:

 construction of the three n = 2 multiplet spectra:

1. osp(2|4)  su(3)  su(2) for m 111
2. osp(2|4)  so(5) for v5,2
3. osp(2|4)  su(2)3 for q111

 construction of the single n = 3 multiplet spectrum, corresponding to the n 010 space.

in this case the kaluza klein states are organized in osp(3|4)  su(3) multiplets.

 search of the appropriate kahlerian conifold that leads to the three dimensional conformal

eld theory corresponding to each of the above cases.

 test of the ads/cf t conjecture at the level of both the long and the short multiplets.
 determination of the eective low energy n = 2 lagrangians, namely search of the ap-
propriate special kahler manifold and of its geometrical interpretation as moduli space
of an appropriate structure.

 as for the n = 3 theory, here supersymmetry is already strong enough to predict the
structure of the eective lagrangian. as shown in [38] the 3  8 complex scalars of the
n 010 compactication will ll the coset manifold:

su(3, 8)

su(3)  su(8)  u(1)

(8.1)

the nal goal of our research plan is to provide new non trivial checks of the ads/cf t
correspondence in cases where the spectrum of primary conformal operators is not too much
restricted by supersymmetry.
in particular we are interested in exploring properties of non
trivial threedimensional conformal eld theories by means of classical supergravity on anti
de sitter compactications ads4  x7 where x7 are suitable 7-manifolds with interesting geo-
metrical structures and to establish the relation between the quantum aspects of the 3d eld
theory and the geometry of x7.
