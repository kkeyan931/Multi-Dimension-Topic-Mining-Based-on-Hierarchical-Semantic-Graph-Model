abstract

the scalars of a n = 1 supersymmetric -model in 4 dimensions parametrize a kahler manifold.
this kahler manifold often takes the form of a tensor product of bundles over a basis manifold.
when one of these bundles is a line bundle, the corresponding kahler form has to satisfy a
quantization condition when the topology of the submanifold is non-trivial. this results in a
consistency restriction on the construction of anomaly free models. we determine the smallest
kahler potentials that satisfy this cocycle condition for any kahlerian coset space g/h, where
h is the centralizer of a torus of a compact lie group g. in this way we obtain a constructive
proof of a theorem by borel-weyl that classies the elements of the (co)homology groups of
g/h. using these results we discuss the consistency of anomaly free models based on the coset
spaces e6/so(10)  u (1) and su (5)/su (2)  u (1)  su (3).

non-linear -models in 4 dimensions with n = 1 supersymmetry may be the eective
eld theory setting for the discussion of models beyond the standard model. chiral
fermions 
l are contained in an irreducible representation of n = 1 supersymmetry
called chiral multiplets  = (z, 
l, h). the lowest components of those multiplets z
are complex scalars that are the coordinates of a complex kahler manifold m [1]. locally
the metric g of this manifold is obtained from a kahler potential k(z, z). non-trivial
examples of kahler manifolds are provided by homogeneous coset spaces g/h, where g
is any compact lie group and h is the centralizer of a torus in g.

the chiral fermion content of a supersymmetric model based on the kahler manifold
m is often anomalous [2, 3]. this leads to the conclusion that supersymmetric mod-
els based on g/h cosets are inconsistent unless a complete mirror sector is introduced,
which is phenomenological uninteresting as it easily results in large fermion masses [4, 5].
however one can avoid this by including additional non-mirror (matter) chiral multiplets
to cancel anomalies. in order that these matter multiplets respect all isometries of m
and are dened globally, their scalar components have to be introduced as sections of
well-dened bundles, that satisfy certain consistency conditions [6, 7]. co(ntra)variant
vectors on m are sections of the (co)tangent bundle and can be used as matter [8, 9].
also line bundles can be used, but the integral over the corresponding kahler form is then
quantized [6]. this condition leads to quantization of newtons constant in supergravity
theories [10] when the kahler potential is covariant but not invariant. the condition also
restricts the freedom of the charge assignment which was used in refs. [11, 12] to obtain
anomaly free supersymmetric models based on the coset g/h. in particular there is a
minimal charge associated to a line bundle; all charges of sections of this line bundle have
to be an integer number times the minimal charge. it is therefore crucial to know the
value of this minimal charge. in this letter we determine the kahler potentials of g/h
that satisfy this line bundle quantization condition and the minimal charge for kahler
coset spaces g/h.

this letter is organized as follows: we rst review the origin of the line bundle quantiza-
tion condition. after that we introduce the necessary and convenient lie group machinery
to describe g/h coset spaces, for any compact simple lie group g. using this we re-
view the construction of kahler potentials for these homogeneous spaces following refs.
[13, 14] with a few minor changes in notation. after this we state the main results of this
work identifying the generating 2-cycles and kahler potentials which satisfy the minimal
quantization conditions and determine the minimal charge of a section of a line bundle
over g/h. we illustrate the restriction posed by the line bundle quantization condition
by discussing two anomaly free models: a model based on e6/so(10)  u(1) [11] and a
grassmannian version of the standard model [12]. in the latter model matter is intro-
duced as sections of subbundles of the tangent bundle; we check their consistency as well.

we now discuss how the condition for a section of a line bundle arises. by using the
covariance of a kahler potential k

k(z, z) = k(z, z)  c(z)  c(z)

under the isometries of m, the transformation rule

s = ec(z)s

(1)

(2)

for a section s of a complex line bundle on m is obtained. the invariant kahler potential

kline(s, s; z, z) = sek(z,z)s.

(3)

can be used for supersymmetric model building purposes [11].
a well-dened bundle over a manifold satises consistency conditions that insure a global
denition of the bundle [6]. the cocycle condition for a line bundle (2) on three overlap-
ping coordinate patches (1, 2, 3) of m demands that

c(123)  c(12) + c(23) + c(31) = 2iz.

(4)

the functions c(123) are elements of the integer second cech cohomology of m. theo-
rems by de rham [6, 15] tell us that the second cech cohomology, the second de rham
cohomology h2(m, z) (containing 2-forms) and the second homology group h2(m) (con-
taining 2-cycles) are all isomorphic. therefore the cocycle condition is equivalent to the
condition that the integral

(k) = 2z

zc

(5)

of any kahler 2-form (k) of h2(m, z) over any 2-cycle c of m is integer. locally the
kahler form (k) can be obtained from a kahler potential k as

(k) = ik,dz  dz.

(6)

in this letter we want to obtain the minimal charges of sections of line bundles over coset
spaces g/h. to do this we need to identify a set of generating 2-cycles ci and a set of
kahler potentials k j such that

(k j) = 2j
i .

from now on we are only concerned with kahlerian homogeneous coset spaces g/h where
g a simple compact lie group. it is convenient to discuss these spaces using the cartan
normalization of the algebra of g which we now review [16, 17, 18]. according to a
theorem by borel [19] a coset g/h is kahlerian if h is the centralizer c(y ) of a torus
in g. this torus is generated by the set y = { i}. the set y can be extended to the
set of generators t = { i} of a cartan subgroup of g. (hence the index i enumerates
the elements of t and i those elements of t which also belong to y .) an arbitrary
linear combination of  i is denoted by  . let  be the generator associated with root 
and let i = i denote the creation and annihilation operators of the simple root i.
hermitean conjugation of the generators is taken to give  
 = . the
algebra of g can be stated as

and 

i =  i

[ i,  j] = 0,

[i, j] = ij j,

[ , ] = ( ),

[ i, j] = gijj,

(7)

n,+  +  a root,
0

otherwise.

[, ] = 

hi,ii = j( i).

the normalization factor n, is irrelevant in the following. in this normalization of the
algebra the cartan matrix is gij  2hi ,j i

following [13, 20, 21] we divided the generators of g into the following sets. we have

already dened the set y = { i}. we denote by

s = {sa} = { i|i 6= i}  {| = xi6=i

ii a root}

(8)

the set of generators of h that are not in y . the two sets

x = {x} = {| / s,  > 0} and

x = { x} = {| / s,  < 0}

(9)

contain the remaining part of the generators of g.
using this notation we give representations of elements of h, g/h, etc. an element
h  h is written as h = eiseiy , where a, i  r and summation over indices has been
assumed to be understood. the subset h  gc of the complexication of the group g
is generated by y, s and x. any element h  h of h is represented as h = eax ebsecy ,
where a, ba, ci  c and therefore an element of gc/ h can be written as

(z) = ez x,

3

(10)

where z  c carries the same root-indices as x. and nally let u(z, z) denote an
element of the unitary representation of g/h. according to [13] h is chosen such that
g/h = gc/ h, hence u(z, z) can be expressed in terms of (z) as

u(z, z) = (z)ea(z,z)xeb(z,z)se 1

2 k(z,z)y .

(11)

the representative u(z, z) of the equivalence classes of g/h is chosen such that b(z, z)
an k(z, z) are real functions. (the reason for the normalization of the function k(z, z)
will become clear in eq. (16).)

the non-linear transformation properties of the coordinates z and z of g/h can be

dened using  [21, 20] or u [22, 23] by

g(z) = (z)h(z; g)

and gu(z, z) = u(z, z)h(z, z; g)

(12)

for any element g of g. the functions h and h are chosen such that (z) and u(z, z)
are again of the forms given above. combining these transformation rules with the iden-
tication of g/h with gc/ h according to eq. (11) shows that

k j (z, z) = k j (z, z)  cj (z; g)  cj 

(z; g);

(13)

thus the functions k j (z, z) transform as kahler potentials [13].

we now review how kahler potentials for g/h coset spaces can be obtained and how
they relate to the kahler potentials k j introduced above [13]. let eb be a complex
vector space on which gc acts as the irreducible representation with highest weight b.
this representation b is a linear homomorphism g  g 7 b(g) : eb  eb. by
introducing a so called bkmu-projector b with the properties

(b)2 = (b) = b

and b(h)b = bb(h)b,

it is shown in refs. [13, 14, 21] that

kb(z, z)  ln det b hb((z))b((z))i

(14)

(15)

transforms as a kahler potential. (we write b() =  hereafter, as the context always
xes the representation.) furthermore this kahler potential kb can be expressed in
terms of the kahler potentials k j introduced in the previous paragraph as

kb(z, z) = trb(cid:18)b i(cid:19)k i(z, z).

(16)

4

we use the subscript b to remind ourselves that the projection operator and the trace are
dened with respect to a representation with highest weight b. using dierent bkmu-
projectors within one representation, explicit expressions for the kahler potentials k j can
be obtained. in ref. [13] it is shown that the set of kahler potentials {k j } is complete
and independent of the representations and projectors used to obtain them.

given an irreducible representation b, we now give an explicit example of a bkmu-
projector. denote by {|b, wi} an orthonormal basis for the complex vector space eb that
is enumerated using the weights w. these vectors satisfy the following properties

 i|b, wi = w( i)|b, wi, hb, w|b, wi = w,w

and

i|b, wi = nb,w,i|b, w  ii

(17)

whenever w  i is an element of the weight space with highest weight b. the normal-
ization factor nb,w,i is chosen such that the norm of the vector |b, w  ii is unity. to
analyze the weight space of any representation it is convenient to introduce the dynkin
labels wi  2hw, ii
hi,ii of a weight w. standard lie group theory [16] teaches us that a dynkin
label wi is integer and whenever wi is positive w  ki with 1  k  wi is also a weight
of representation b. let y be any linear combination of elements of y with positive
coecients. the bkmu-operator [21]

p y

b = xw(y)=b(y)

|b, wihb, w|

(18)

projects on the subspace v y
as the highest weight vector |b, bi.

b of eb which contains elements of eb having the same y-charge

we now dene the projector operators p j which will prove to be crucial in the follow-
ing. let bj be a fundamental weight: a weight which has all its dynkin labels zero except
for the jth one which is 1: (bj )j = j
j . on the representation space associated with this
highest weight bj we dene the projector p j by

p j  p  j
bj

(19)

and denote v j  p j ebj . as the only non-zero dynkin label of highest weight bj is the
jth one, the weight vector following the highest weight vector is |bj , bj  j i. but it
is easy to see that this vector does not have the same  j -charge as bj , hence it is not
contained v j . this shows that v j is one-dimensional and that p j = |bj , bj ihbj , bj |.

we state the main results of this work in the form of the following propositions:

5

a. the kahler potentials k j which form a complete set are given by

k j (z, z) = kp j  ln det p j h(z)(z)i .

(20)

b. the generating 2-cycles ci : cp 1  gc/ h of the homology group h2(g/h) are

given by the continuous mappings

v 7 (0, . . . , 0, zi = v, 0, . . . , 0).

(21)

c. the 2-cycles ci and the kahler potentials k j satisfy the minimal cocycle conditions

(k j) = 2j
i .

zci

(22)

d. the generating kahler forms of the cohomology group h2(g/h, z) are (k j).

e. the minimal  j -charge of a section sj of a line bundle over g/h is half the charge

of zj .

a corollary of proposition a is that the kahler potentials k j and hence any kahler
potential kb is a sum of logs of ordinary scalar functions of z and z because the subspace
v j was one-dimensional.

we now prove these results:

a. we want to use eq. (16) to express kp j in the kahler potentials k i, therefore we

calculate tr(cid:16)p j  i(cid:17). as v j is one-dimensional this reduces to

tr(cid:16)p j  i(cid:17) = bj ( i) = i( i)(g1)ijj

j = gii(g1)ij = j
i ,

(23)

using the properties (17) of the representation vector |bj , bj i. from this eq. (20)
follows directly.

b. the 2-cycles ci are clearly independent. the maps (21) are the identity on the
restrictions of g/h to the submanifolds on which they are onto. therefore the
images of the maps ci are compact and they wind only once around the submanifold
of g/h. because g is a simple compact lie group, h2(g/h) = h1(h) = zn,
where n counts the number of u(1) factors in h. to show this one uses that
0  h  g  g/h  0 is a short exact sequence [6], the kunneth formula
[7] and the fact that the rst homology group of simple compact lie groups is trivial.
as there are as many ci as u(1) factors in h, it follows that the 2-cycles ci generate
all 2-cycles.

6

c. we have to calculate rci (k j|ci ) with k j = ln detp j (p jp j). here kj |ci de-

notes the restriction of k j to the image of ci. using (21) we nd in particular
|ci = exp(vi). the projector p j in eq. (19) satises the following properties

i ip j = j

i p j

and (cid:18)i(cid:19)n

p j = 0, n > 1.

this follows from eq. (23) and because only root j can be subtracted once from
bj , as the dynkin labels of bj are (bj )j = j
j . with these relations, we obtain the
following simplication

p j (z)(z)p j(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ci

i vv(cid:17) p j .
the kahler potential k j restricted to ci becomes k j |ci = j
i ln [1 + vv] . by notic-
ing that this is the standard cp 1 kahler potential, the integral over ci reduces to
the integral over the kahler form of cp 1. this integral is equal to 2, hence we
obtain (22).

= (cid:16)1 + j

d. this follows by denition from eq. (22).

e. the section sj with the smallest  i of a line bundle of g/h has a kahler potential
given by eq. (3) with k = k j . under innitesimal internal symmetry transforma-
tions, it transforms as sj = cj sj according to eq. (13). then to determine the
charge of sj we have to know the holomorphic functions cj for u(1) transforma-
tions. now using the transformation properties of (z) of eq. (12) in the case where
g = exp(ii  i) with i innitesimal parameters, we obtain

ii  i(z) = (z)i (cid:20)

 iz + ia x + ib s + ic y(cid:21) .

on the other hand from [ i, ] = ( i) it follows that

 i(z) = (z)(cid:20) i  ( i)



 z(cid:21) .

combining these expressions and using the independence of y , s and x gives

icj = ij
i ,

iz = i( i)z

(24)

and ia = ib = 0. from these equations the statement follows, as j( j ) = 2.

7

this completes the proof of the main results of this letter. we have obtained a constructive
proof of a theorem by borel and weyl, discussed by serre [24] that classies the elements
of the (co)homology groups using associated highest weights. a highest weight b is called
associated when the subgroup hb  gc of the complexication of g that is generated by

t  {|h, bi > 0}

(25)

is contained in h: hb  h. notice that the fundamental weights bj , we used in the
construction of the kahler potentials k j dened above, are associated highest weights.
any associated highest weight b can be written as a linear combination b = bj bj with
non-negative integer coecients bj of the highest weights bj .

we now turn to the consequences of our results for supersymmetric model building. in the
construction of a model we may need the transformation rule of a section of a line bundle
to get a u(1) charge assignment such that anomaly cancelation is ensured. however in
general it is not guaranteed that the charge we need is an integer multiple of the minimal
line bundle charge as determined by statement e above. how this restriction acts, is now
illustrated by two anomaly free models build upon coset spaces.

ref. [11] discusses an anomaly free model based on the coset e6/so(10)  u(1) [25].
the coset is parametrized by a 16-component spinor of so(10). to cancel the u(1)-
anomaly the model is extended to complete the 27 of e6. according to the branching
rule

27 = 1(4) + 16(1) + 10(2),

(26)

this can be done by introducing a so(10) singlet with charge 4 and a vector of so(10)
with charge 2. as discussed in ref. [11] the vector can be obtained from a tensor product
of 2 tangent bundles of e6/so(10)  u(1). however this vector of so(10) has charge 2
and the so(10) singlet has charge 0. according to the results above the minimal charge of
a section s of a line bundle is 1/2. hence we need the 8th power of s to dene the singlet
and the 8th power of s times the vector to dene the vector with the right charges.
both these powers of s are integers, therefore this models satises the bundle consistency
conditions.

ref. [12] discusses another example of an anomaly free model that is based on the
grassmannian coset su(5)/su(2)  u(1)  su(3) [26, 27, 28] with the chiral fermion
content of the standard model. for this model the question whether it is globally well-
dened is more involved, as matter is not introduced in the tangent bundle. to see what
the diculty is, we give a short review of the introduction of matter in this model; for

8

l . the superpartners l and d of a lepton doublet li

details we refer to ref. [12].
the coordinates qia of this coset are interpreted as the superpartners of the left-handed
quark doublet qia
l and a (down) quark
triplet da
l were introduced by noticing that the transformation rule for dqia factorizes
under innitesimal transformations [12] dq = h(q)dq + dq h(q) where h(q) and
h(q) are holomorphic functions. this can be used to dene innitesimal transformation
rules for l and d: l = h(q)l and d = d h(q). as these are only innitesimal
transformations, we do not obtain any information concerning global consistency.
we now show that l and d can be interpreted as sections of bundles over this coset.
using the transformation property (12) of (q) with a su(5) matrix given by

c d! ,
g =  a b

(27)

where a  su(2), d  su(3), b a 2  3 and c a 3  2 matrix, we obtain the global
transformation rule for q:

q = (aq + b) (d + cq)1 .

(28)

by introducing the matrices  = a1b and  = d1c this can be written as

a1qd = 11  (11  ) (11 + q)1 .

from this equation it follows that the transformation of the dierential factorizes as

q ia
qjb = (g)i

j( g) a
b ,

(29)

indeed dq = a (11  ) (11 + q)1 dq (11 + q)1 d1. now we know that the tangent
bundle is well-dened, therefore the transition functions g(ab) and g(ba) satisfy all con-
sistency conditions by eq. (29). by dening the transition functions acting on l and d
via

l(a) = g(ab)l(b) and d(a) = d(b) g(ba),

(30)

well-dened bundles over su(5)/su(2)  u(1)  su(3) are obtained.
we now turn to the line bundle constraint. in the normalization of the su(5) algebra
employed in ref. [12], the uy (1) charges of q, l and d are resp. 5, 3 and 2. according
to the results above the charges of section of the line bundle are half of the charge of the
coset coordinates q, therefore the minimum charge is 5/2. the matching between the

9

weak hypercharge yw and the charge y for the quark doublets requires that y = 15yw.
as the hypercharges of the standard model are integer multiples of 1/3, it follows that the
y -charges we need are integer multiples of 5. but an integer multiple of 5/2 plus either
2 or 3 never is an integer multiple of 5, therefore we can never get the standard model
hypercharge assignment. we conclude that the grassmannian standard model with non-
linear compact su(5) symmetry can never be dened globally. to be sure, there exist
consistent grassmannian coset models based on su(5), but with matter content dierent
from the standard model.

the main objective of this work was to determine the generating 2-cycles and kahler
potential which satisfy the minimal quantization condition (22) for a general kahlerian
coset space g/h. the bkmu projector p j (eq. (19)) projects on the highest weight
vector of a representation with highest weight bj with the dynkin labels (bj )j = j
j . this
projector was used to dene the kahler potential k j (eq. (20)) and its properties showed
that this kahler potential satises the minimal cocycle conditions. the minimal charge of
a section sj of a line bundle associated with  i was found to be half of the charge of zj .
in this way we obtained an constructive proof a the theorem by borel-weyl discussed by
serre [24] that classies the elements of the (co)homology groups of g/h.
the importance of these results lies in the fact that they provide an additional restric-
tion on supersymmetric -model building. this has been illustrated by the review of two
anomaly free models containing a coset space at their core. the e6/so(10)  u(1) model
satises the consistency condition. the analysis for su(5)/su(2)  u(1)  su(3) was
more involved. first we showed that the scalars li and da are sections of well-dened
bundles. using the fact that the transition function of the tangent bundle factorizes,
transition functions for these bundles were obtained. however the necessary charge as-
signment of this grassmannian standard model is such that we can never satisfy the line
bundle consistency condition at the same time.
as is clear from these examples the consistent denition of a line bundle provides a strin-
gent restriction on supersymmetric -models, in particular those based on coset spaces.
with this in mind, it is interesting to study what kind of other supersymmetric models
are allowed and what their phenomenology is.
