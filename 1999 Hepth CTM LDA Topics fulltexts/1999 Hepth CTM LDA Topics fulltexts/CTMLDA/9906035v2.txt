abstract

in this letter we show that the preferred kleingordon quantum field theo-
ries (qfts) on a d-dimensional de sitter spacetime can be obtained from a klein
gordon qft on a (d + 1)-dimensional ambient minkowski spacetime satisfying
the spectral condition and, conversely, that a kleingordon qft on a (d + 1)-
dimensional ambient minkowski spacetime satisfying the spectral condition can
be obtained as superposition of d-dimensional de sitter kleingordon elds in the
preferred vacuum. these results establish a correspondence between qfts living
on manifolds having dierent dimensions. the method exposed here can be applied
to study other situations and notably qft on anti de sitter spacetime.

the study of the relations between quantum field theories (qfts) in dierent di-
mensions has come recently to the general attention. some of the most interesting and
intriguing developments of qft and string theory, like maldacenas ads/cft conjec-
ture [1, 2] and thoofts [3] and susskinds [4] holographic principle, seem to indicate that
relations of this kind are going to play a fundamental role in understanding qft and
string theory.

in this letter we point out a relation that exists between minkowski qft and de sitter
qft in one dimension less. we show that the preferred [5, 6] de sitter kleingordon
eld of squared mass  arises by averaging in a well-dened sense an ordinary klein
gordon eld of mass m living in the minkowski ambient spacetime and, vice versa, the
kleingordon eld in the ambient minkowski spacetime can be obtained by superposing
elds in the lower dimensional de sitter manifold.

1

the idea that qfts on the de sitter manifold can be obtained by restriction from
the ambient spacetime is of course not new, but it has been of little use in the standard
coordinate approach to de sitter eld theories.

recently, however, it has been shown [7, 8] that the well-known [5] thermal properties
of the de sitter kleingordon elds in the preferred vacuum, are linked to certain
analyticity properties of the correlation functions; these properties are precisely obtained
by restriction to the de sitter manifold of the analyticity properties of the (general)
correlation functions in the ambient spacetime, which hold when the corresponding qft
satises the energymomentum spectral condition [9].

this idea has then been pushed further and it has become possible to show that the
thermal interpretation can be established also for interacting de sitter eld theories [10].
in this letter we take one step more by showing how a kleingordon minkowski eld
in the wightman vacuum gives rise to a kleingordon eld on the de sitter spacetime
in the preferred thermal vacuum, giving a further argument in favour of the adjective
preferred. indeed, as it is well known, there are in general innitely many inequivalent
vacua corresponding to a certain qft and one needs criteria to select the physically
meaningful ones. this is true already for minkowski qft but, in this case, one has
strong physical criteria to select among the vacua. the situation is more dicult when
considering qfts on a curved background, but several criteria have been established also
in this case (many of them however work only for linear eld theories). the preferred
vacuum for de sitter kleingordon elds has been shown to satisfy many of such criteria,
such as the hadamard condition [11]. here we prove that, actually, the preferred klein
gordon de sitter qfts can be directly obtained by any massive or massless wightman
kleingordon qft in the ambient spacetime. there is however a restriction on the
mass of the elds that can be obtained this way. in particular when working with a d-
dimensional de sitter hyperboloid of unit radius we can construct de sitter kleingordon
elds whose mass is greater or equal to (d  1)/2.

the existence of such a link gives also a quantitative support to the idea that a
thermal eect on a curved manifold can be looked at as an unruh eect in a higher (at)
dimensional spacetime [12, 13].

let therefore m = {x  md+1 : x x  < 0} be the manifold of events which
are spacelike w.r.t. a chosen event (which is taken as the origin of a frame) of a (d + 1)-
dimensional minkowski space-time md+1. coordinates of md+1 are denoted by {x },
 = 0, . . . , d. m is foliated by a family of d-dimensional de sitter spacetimes identied
with the hyperboloids

yr = {x x  = (x 0)2  ( ~x)2 = r2 }.

(1)

as a topological manifold, m = r+  y, where r+ is the positive real half-line with
coordinate r and y = y1 is the d-dimensional de sitter spacetime with radius r = 1.
points of y are denoted by y (i.e. y2 = 1).

we can therefore assign to an event of m coordinates (r, y) so that x = ry and

y2 = 1. the minkowskian metric of m can consequently be rewritten as follows:

ds2 = dr2 + r2ds2

y ,

where ds2
the ambient space.

y is the de sitter metric of y obtained as restriction of the minkowski metric of

m is a globally hyperbolic manifold where quantum eld theory can be formulated

[11]. let us therefore consider a canonical quantum eld b on m satisfying the klein
gordon equation ((cid:3) + m 2)b(x) = 0 (in the following we will consider the massive case

m > 0; the massless case can be obtained by a limit procedure but can also be studied
directly, with a considerable simplication of the formulae), and let us also consider the
corresponding equation for the modes (x). by separating the variables as in the metrics
we write (x) = (r)(y) and we are led to the following equations:

((cid:3)y + ) (y) = 0

r2(cid:18)2

let us consider in particular the equation (3) for the radial modes . the operator
appearing at the l.h.s. is self-adjoint (on a suitable domain) w.r.t. the following hilbert
product:

(, ) =zr+

(r)(r)rd2dr .

(4)

2 f (r) and the rescaling  = mr, which
by means of the transformation (r) = r
together are particular instances of the so called lommels transformation, eq.
(3)
is turned into the modied bessels equation. by further introducing the variable x =
log  =, we nally obtain the following equation (the prime means derivative w.r.t. x):

1d

 f 

 + (e2x  2)f = 0

with

.

(5)

we have thus obtained the schrodinger problem for a particle in a one-dimensional po-
tential e2x with eigenvalue 2; this problem is to be studied in the standard hilbert space
l2(r). the spectrum is nondegenerate and coincides with the positive real line; this
implies that 4 > (d  1)2.

the solutions which have the correct asymptotic behaviour at x =  are the modied
bessel functions ki(ex) [14]. these modes are real, and their asymptotic behaviour near
x =  is the following:

ki(ex)  (cid:20)



sinh()(cid:21) 1

we now introduce the elds b(y) on the de sitter manifold y by smearing the eld
b with the complete set of radial modes (8):

b(y) =zr+ b(x)(r)rd2dr.

the preferred (also called euclidean or bunch-davies) vacuum state. in precise terms,

our main result is that the eld b(y) is a kleingordon eld on the de sitter manifold in
the minkowski vacuum expectation values (v.e.v.) of the elds b(y) are given by

where w is the preferred two-point function of de sitter kleingordon eld in dimen-
sion d [8].

in particular, the elds b have zero correlation (and hence commute) for

we now will give an argument to prove the result by rst of all deriving an explicit
expression for w,(y, y) (eq. 15 below) . let us rewrite the v.e.v. appearing at the lhs
of eq. (12) by using the momentum representation of the two-point function of the eld

in this expression we insert the parametrisations x = r y and x  = r y and introduce
the vector  dened by the relation m = p , where p is on the mass shell;  is therefore
on the unit shell 2 = 1, 0 > 0.
by exchanging the order of integration we are led to the following integrals ([14], vol ii,

the integral appearing in the denition of these waves is well dened at both extrema

we are nally led to consider the following expression:

w,(y, y) =z dd+1

(2)d (2  1)(0)(y, )(y, ) .

(15)

this formula coincides with the preferred two-point function of the de sitter klein
gordon eld in dimension d (see eq. 12), giving at the same time a new integral repre-
sentation for it. the actual full proof of this claim is somewhat involved and will be given
elsewhere [15].

we can however illustrate the result in the simplest case d = 1 where things are easier.
in this case the de sitter spacetime has only time and no space: it can be visualised
as the two branches of an hyperbola in the twodimensional minkowski spacetime; these
represent the worldlines of two uniformly accelerated observers.
the plane waves  reduce here to ordinary trigonometric functions in the rectifying
parameter of the hyperbola.

to carry out the computation of the integral (15) we parametrise  = (cid:18) cosh(s)
sinh(s)(cid:19)
and y(t) = (cid:18) sinh(t)
 cosh(t)(cid:19); t is the proper time of the freely falling observer in the

onedimensional de sitter spacetime (the same observer is actually subject to a constant
acceleration when regarded from the minkowskian ambient space). by taking the two
points on the same branch of the hyperbola (say, the right one) we promptly nd y(t) =
sinh(s + t). the measure d2(2  1)(0) becomes simply 1
a second step exploits the analyticity properties of the minkowskian wightman function
and of our plane waves by shifting the two times t, t by an imaginary part t 7 t  i/2
and t 7 t + i/2. it follows that

this twopoint function correspond to the preferred one for de sitter kleingordon
quantum eld as given in [8] as well as to that of a quantum harmonic oscillator in a
thermal state at the inverse temperature 2. indeed, the quantum kleingordon eld
on a onedimensional spacetime corresponds to a single quantum harmonic oscillator
in the heisenberg picture where the mass represents the spring constant. the thermal
time correlation function at an inverse temperature  of the position operator of such as
oscillator is given by:

w (t, t) =

cos((t  t + i/2))

2 sinh(/2)

which is precisely the expression derived above with  = 2. this simple computation
gives a quantitative support of the relations between hawking eect in de sitter and
unruh eect in a at spacetime as in [12, 13].
we can also invert the transformation (11). indeed, using the completeness of the radial

(16)

(17)

(18)

modes in eqs. (10) we can express the ambient eld b as
d (r)b(y) ,

b(r, y) =z

and consequently obtain the following decomposition of the wightman function

this formula allows to express the restriction of the ambient eld b to a xed leaf r = r

as a superposition of kleingordon elds in the respective euclidean vacuum,

h|b(r, y)b(r, y)|i =z

the soobtained kallenlehmann type of expansion has a weight in the square mass
parameter  given by the density of states per unit spectrum per unit volume of the self

these results hold true in any dimension and can actually be generalised to other
manifolds. for instance, by the same methods, one can decompose a d+1-dimensional anti
de sitter (ads) spacetime into a d-dimensional minkowski spacetime and a 1-dimensional
minkowski leaf parametrised by a radial coordinate r.
in a sense this generalises the
geometrical basis of the ads/cft correspondence conjecture [1] where one describes the
minkowski space as a boundary of an ads manifold (that is r is sent to innity). these
and other results will be discussed elsewhere [15, 16].
