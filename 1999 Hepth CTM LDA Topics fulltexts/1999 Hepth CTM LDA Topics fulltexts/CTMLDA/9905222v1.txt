abstract

we investigate the generalized gauge theory which has been proposed previ-
ously and show that in two dimensions the instanton gauge xing of the gener-
alized topological yang-mills action leads to a twisted n = 2 supersymmetric
action. we have found that the r-symmetry of n = 2 supersymmetry can be
identied with the avour symmetry of dirac-kahler fermion formulation. thus
the procedure of twist allows topological ghost elds to be interpreted as the
dirac-kahler matter fermions.

1 introduction

in formulating unied theory it is the general consensus that the supersymmetry may

play a crucial.

it is important to understand the origin of supersymmetry and the

fermion and boson correspondence. there is an interesting example of topological eld

theory analysis by witten[1] which suggests the possible origin of n = 2 supersymme-

try and the generation of fermionic elds from ghost via twisting procedure. later it

has been pointed out that this theory can be derived from the partially brst gauge-

xed action of the topological yang-mills action with instanton gauge xing [2, 3]. this

subject has been intensively investigated [4], particularly in connection with supersym-

metric eld theories [5]. in this paper we claim that the topological twist generating

the matter fermions from ghosts is essentially related to the dirac-kahler fermion for-

mulation.

in 1960s kahler [6] has shown that dirac equation is constructed from inhomo-

geneous dierential forms which are called dirac-kahler elds [7]. moreover dirac-

kahler fermion is a curved spacetime version of kogut-susskind fermion [8] or staggered

fermion [9] and thus a natural framework of the lattice fermion formulation [10].

about ten years ago one of the authors (n.k.) and watabiki proposed a general-

ization of the ordinary three-dimensional chern-simons theory into arbitrary dimen-

sions by introducing all the degrees of dierential forms as gauge elds and param-

eters together with quaternion structure [11]. later the quantization of the even-

dimensional version of the generalized chern-simons actions has been completed by

batalin-vilkovisky formulation [12]. this formulation can be, however, generalized to

topological yang-mills and ordinary yang-mills actions.

since the generalized gauge theory is formulated by dierential forms it has close

connection with the dirac-kahler fermion formulation. we believe that the general-

ized gauge theory may play a crucial role in formulating the unied model including

quantum gravity on the simplicial lattice manifold [13].

in this paper we investigate the generalized topological yang-mills theory from

the topological eld theory point of view. an enlarged algebraic structure of brst

transformations a la baulieu-singer [3] is naturally constructed in a unied way by

the generalized gauge theory. as the simplest example towards more realistic case, we

quantize the two-dimensional version of the generalized topological yang-mills action

1

and show that the partially gauge-xed action with instanton gauge xing leads

to a twisted n = 2 supersymmetric abelian higgs action [14, 15] without symmetry

breaking potential term.

it is interesting to recognize that our instanton relations

coincide with dimensionally reduced seiberg-witten equations [16] from four into two

dimensions [17]. we point out that the fermionic ghost elds can be interpreted as

dirac-kahler fermion elds and thus the twisting procedure is nothing but the dirac-

kahler fermion formulation.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we summarize the generalized gauge

theory in arbitrary dimensions. in section 3 we analyze the generalized two-dimensional

topological yang-mills theory as a topological eld theory. in section 4 we explicitly

verify the twisted n = 2 supersymmetric algebra for the gauge-xed action. in section

5 we explain the twisting mechanism via dirac-kahler formulation. conclusions and

discussions are given in the nal section.

2 generalized gauge theories in arbitrary dimen-

sions

in this section we summarize the formulation of the generalized gauge theory with an

emphasis on their algebraic structures.

the essential point of the generalization is to extend a one-form gauge eld and

zero-form gauge parameter to a quaternion valued generalized gauge eld and gauge

parameter which contain forms of all possible degrees.

in the most general form, a generalized gauge eld a and a gauge parameter v are

dened by the following component form:

a = 1 + i  + ja + k a,
v = 1a + ia + j + k,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where (, ), ( , ), (a, a) and ( a, a) are direct sums of fermionic odd forms, fermionic

even forms, bosonic odd forms and bosonic even forms, respectively, and they take

values on a gauge algebra. the symbols 1, i, j and k satisfy the following quaternion

algebra:

12 = 1,

ij = ji = k,

2

i2 = 1,

j2 = 1, k2 = 1,
jk = kj = i, ki = ik = j.

(2.3)

the following graded lie algebra can be adopted as a gauge algebra:

[ta, tb] = f c

abtc,

[ta, ] = g
{, } = hc

a,

tc,

(2.4)

where all the structure constants are subject to consistency conditions which follow
from the graded jacobi identities. the components of the gauge eld a and the gauge
parameter v are particularly assigned as elements of the gauge algebra
a =  a,

 = t a a,

a = t aaa,

 = ,

(2.5)

a = t aaa,

 = t aa,

 =  ,

a = a.

the component expansion of the same type as a and v are classied as elements of
-class and +-class, respectively. these elements fulll the z2-grading structure

[+, +]  +,

[+, ]  ,

{+, +}  +,

(2.6)

where +  + and   . in particular the exterior derivative belongs to -class

q = jd,

(2.7)

and the following relations similar to the ordinary exterior derivative operator hold

q(12) = (q1)2 + ()|1|1(q2), q2 = 0,

(2.8)

where |1| = 0 for 1  + and |1| = 1 for 1  . to construct the generalized
actions, the two types of traces for the gauge algebra should be introduced,

tr[t a,  ] = 0, tr[,  ] = 0,
str{,  } = 0,
str[t a,  ] = 0,

(2.9)

(2.10)

where (  ) in the commutators and the anticommutator denote a product of the gen-
erators. these denitions of the traces are crucial so that the generalized actions are

invariant under the generalized gauge transformations.

we can then construct generalized actions in terms of these generalized quantities.

the generalized chern-simons actions which have been previously proposed [11] are

3

given on even- and odd-dimensional manifolds m,

seven =zm
sodd =zm

trk(cid:18)aqa +
strj(cid:18)aqa +

2

3a3(cid:19),
3a3(cid:19),

2

(2.11)

(2.12)

where trk(  ) and strj(  ) are dened so as to pick up only the coecient of k and
j from (  ) and take the traces. we then need to pick up d-form terms corresponding
to d-dimensional manifolds m. these actions are invariant up to surface terms under

the following generalized gauge transformation:

a = [q + a,v],

(2.13)

where v is the generalized gauge parameter. it should be noted that this symmetry
is much larger than the usual gauge symmetry since the gauge parameter v contains
many parameters of various forms.

there is another suggestive topological nature due to the parallel construction to

the standard gauge theory.

in the generalized gauge theory it is possible to dene

generalized chern character which is expected to have topological nature

str1(f n) = str1(q2n1),
tri(f n) = tri(q2n1),

where f is a generalized curvature

f = qa + a2,

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

and 2n1 are the generalized chern-simons form. eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) are bosonic
even form and bosonic odd form, respectively. especially, for n = 2 case in (2.14), we

obtain a topological yang-mills type action related to a one dimension lower generalized

chern-simons action on an even-dimensional manifold m,

zm

str1f 2 =zm

str1 q(cid:16)aqa +

(2.17)

which has the same forms of the standard relation.

3 generalized topological yang-mills theory in two

dimensions

in this section we analyze the two-dimensional version of the generalized topological

yang-mills action. our formulation of this section is the two-dimensional realization

of the known four-dimensional scenario [1, 2, 3] and can be extended to arbitrary

dimensions.

as we have already mentioned that the action we consider satises the following

well known relation:

zm

str1f 2

0 =zm

str1 q(cid:16)a0qa0 +

0(cid:17)!,
2
3a3

(3.1)

where a0 and f0 are the two-dimensional counter part of the classical gauge eld and
curvature. more explicitly they are given by

 ,

a0 = j + k( + b),
f0 = qa0 + a2
= 1(cid:16)d + 2 + {, b} + 2(cid:17) + i(cid:16)d + [, ](cid:17),

0

(3.2)

(3.3)

 +,

where ,  and b are graded lie algebra valued zero-, one- and two-form gauge elds,

respectively. due to the topological nature of the action, the action has so called shift

symmetry. in other wards the action is invariant under the arbitrary deformation of the
gauge eld a0, which we denote e0. thus the gauge transformation of the generalized
topological yang-mills action has the following form:

a0 = [q + a0,v0] + e0,

where v0 is the generalized gauge parameter

v0 = 1(v + b) + iu,

 +,

while e0 is a new gauge parameter of the shift symmetry and is given by

e0 = j(1) + k((0) + (2)),

 ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

where the sux (n) with n = 0, 1, 2 denotes the form degree. hereafter we use the

same notation to the form degree. the eld strength is transformed under the gauge

transformation (3.4),

f0 = [f0,v0] + {q + a0,e0}.

(3.7)

5

the rst term is transformed covariantly, and the second term is inhomogeneous gauge
transformation of f0 by the gauge parameter which belongs to -class.

the topological shift symmetry of e0, however, can absorb the usual gauge trans-
formation, so that this is a reducible system with the following obvious reducibility

conditions:

v0 = v1,
e0 = [q + a0,v1].

(3.8)

correspondingly we need to introduce ghost elds with respect to the generalized gauge

symmetry and the topological shift symmetry, and ghost for ghost elds with respect

to the additional gauge symmetry of the gauge parameter (3.8).

although we can construct the nilpotent brst algebra of the above reducible

system by the procedure of cohomological perturbation [18], we can treat it in an

algebraically unied way by using the characteristic of the generalized gauge system.

we redene the generalized gauge eld by introducing the generalized ghost elds c(0),

c(1) and c(2)

a = 1c(1) + i(c(0) + c(2)) + j + k( + b),

 .

(3.9)

we need to introduce a generalized eld which belongs another class of a to accomodate
the topological ghost elds ec(0), ec(1) and ec(2) and the ghost for ghost elds (0), (1)

and (2)

c = 1((0) + (2)) + i(1) + j(ec(0) + ec(2)) + kec(1),

 +.

(3.10)

here c belongs + and could be identied as a part of generalized curvature later.

furthermore we extend the concept of the dierential operator by introducing the

brst operator s as a fermionic zero-form,

q  q + qb = jd + is,

 .

(3.11)

it should be noted that s commutes with d, i.e. [d, s] = 0 and s2 = 0. this operator

satises the nilpotency property due to the quaternion structures,

 the fermionic operator s acts as a left derivative on elds in the same way as the operation of

q2 = 0.

(3.12)

the exterior derivative d.

6

the following graded leibnitz rule acting on generalized gauge elds can be derived:

q(12) = (q1)2 + ()|1|1(q2),

(3.13)

where |1| = 0 for 1  + and |1| = 1 for 1  .

we can now construct brst transformation algebraically in a unied way. we

dene the generalized curvature by using the redened gauge eld

f = qa + a2
= f0 + c,

(3.14)

where the second relation is imposed to relate the brst transformation with respect
to classical and generalized ghost elds. c = 0 corresponds to impose usual horizontal
conditions. while the transformations with respect to the topological ghost and ghost

for ghost elds are derived by the following bianchi identity of the generalized eld,

the component wise expressions of brst transformation can be read from (3.14) and

qf + [a,f ] = 0.

(3.15)

(3.15):

s = [c(0), ]  ec(0),
s = dc(0) + [, c(0)]  {c(1), } + ec(1),
sb = dc(1) + {, c(1)}  [c(0), b]  [c(2), ]  ec(2),
sc(0) = c 2
sc(1) = {c0, c(1)} + (1),
sc(2) = c 2

(0)  (0),

(1)  {c(0), c(2)}  (2),
sec(0) = {c(0), ec(0)}  [, (0)],
sec(1) = d(0) + [, (0)] + [c(1), ec(0)]  {c(0), ec(1)} + {, (1)},
sec(2) = d(1) + {, (1)}  [c(1), ec(1)]  {c(0), ec(2)}  {c(2), ec(0)}
s(0) = [c(0), (0)],
s(1) = [c(1), (0)]  [c(0), (1)],
s(2) = [c(1), (1)]  [c(0), (2)]  [c(2), (0)].

[, (2)]  [b, (0)],

(3.16)

these algebraic and geometric constructions of brst transformation were empha-

sized by baulieu-singer [3] for four-dimensional topological yang-mills model. we here

propose the natural extension of their approach in the framework of the generalized

gauge theory. moreover we do not have to introduce the ghost number for elds and

the brst operator which played an important role in the above authors formulations.

in deriving brst transformations (3.16) we only compare the terms expanded in the

form-degrees and the coecients of quaternions in (3.14) and (3.15). the conventional

ghost number for particular elds and brst charge are automatically assigned by the

quaternionic classications.

next we can consider the physical observable. we can construct brst invariant

polynomials because of the nilpotency property of the extended dierential operator.

bianchi identity leads to the following algebraic relation,

qf n = [a,f n].

(3.17)

taking a trace of the gauge algebra and particular quaternion sector, we obtain the

following relations due to the vanishing nature of the r.h.s. of (3.17):

strj(qf n) = strj(cid:16)(q + qb)f n(cid:17) = 0,
stri(qf n) = stri(cid:16)(q + qb)f n(cid:17) = 0,

which lead to the following descendent equations:

sstrk(f n) = dstr1(f n),
sstr1(f n) = dstrk(f n).

we can then nd series of gauge invariant physical observables:

o =z

e =z
ob

strkf n,
str1f n,

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

(3.21)

where  is a homology cycle on the submanifold in m and of
dimensional fermionic and even-dimensional bosonic observables, respectively.

o and ob

e denote odd-

although we consider the above brst algebra in two-dimensional case, we will see

that the algebra in arbitrary dimensions can be treated in the similar way.

we next introduce a particular model to carry out explicit analyses. to make the

formulation concrete and simpler we specify to the two-dimensional at euclidean case

8

and take the following two-dimensional antihermitian euclidean cliord algebra as the

graded algebra, which closes under the multiplication and is the simplest example:

t a : 1,

5,

 : a,

(3.22)

where a = (i1, i2), which satisfy {a, b} = 2ab and 5 = 1
2abab = i3 with
12 = 1. a grading generator can be identied as 5 and then we dene the supertrace

the two-dimensional topological yang-mills action lead

str(  ) = tr(5   ).

s0 =

=z d2x(cid:16)f||2 +  ab(d)a(d)b(cid:17)
=z d2x(cid:16)2||2 + abab(cid:17),

(3.23)

where f =    and (d)a = a  2a
scalar part of the one-form eld s and two-form eld ba in the generalized eld

bb. in the action (3.23) the

(3.3) drop out because of the reducible structures of the gauge transformations. then

the generalized gauge transformations are consistently truncated to the following so(2)

invariance,

gaugea = 2va

bb,

gauge = v,

(3.24)

where v is a zero-form gauge parameter. as we have discussed we impose the topological

shift symmetry, then brst transformations (3.16) lead to the following truncated

forms:

sa = 2a

bbc  eca,

s = c + ec,
sc = ,
seca = 2a
sec = ,

s = 0,

bcecb  2a

bb,

(3.25)

where c, (eca, ec), and  are the ghost elds associated with so(2) gauge symme-

try and topological shift symmetries, and the ghost for ghost eld with the reducible

9

symmetry, respectively. these brst transformations indeed satisfy the nilpotency

property.

we can now nd out a two-dimensional instanton relation of our generalized gauge

system by imposing the self- (anti-self-) dual condition

 f0 = f0.

(3.26)

since a repeated application of  on the generalized eld strength must yield identity
map, we dene the following duality relation for the gauge operators and quaternions

in addition to the usual hodge dual operation on the dierential forms:

 1 = 5,

a = a

bb,

5 = 1,

 1 = 1,

i = i.

(3.27)

(3.28)

we can then nd the following minimal condition of the action leading to instanton

relations:

1

2z str1f0  f0 +

a

c(d)c(cid:17)!.

(3.29)

then the instanton relations are obtained from the conditions for the absolute minima

of the generalized yang-mills action

f  ||2 = 0,

2(cid:16)(d)a

b(d)b(cid:17) = 0.

(3.30)

(3.31)

these instanton relations are natural consequence of the formulation of the generalized

topological yang-mills action as we have seen above.

it has appeared to our attention by the recent paper [17] that the dimensionally

reduced seiberg-witten equation [16] from four into two dimensions coincide with the

eqs. (3.30) and (3.31).

it should be noted that the weyl spinor in seiberg-witten

equation corresponds to the higgs scalar in our formulation. the explicit solutions

have been obtained as the liouville vortex solution by nergiz and sacloglu [17] for the

10

solution of the seiberg-witten equation. the solutions are

 = 1 + i2 = 2

,

2(cid:16) gdg  gdg
1  gg (cid:17),

i

 = dx =

(3.32)

where g = g(z) is an arbitrary holomorphic function and g is the complex conjugate

of g with z = x1 + ix2.

the topological nature of the solutions is explicitly veried by calculating a ux

 =z f d2x = 4n,

(3.33)

where f = 1

2f  = ||2. here we have chosen the holomorphic function as g(z) = zn.
due to the singular nature of the solutions (3.32), we need particular regularization to

obtain the explicit topological relation (3.33).

it is worth to mention at this stage that there is another kind of solution to the

modied instanton relation or equivalently bogomolnyi equation,

1
2

f  ||2 + |v|2 = 0,

(3.34)

while the second relation (3.31) is the same. these relations yield nielsen-olesen vor-

tex solution [19] which has again topological nature [14]. it is important to recognize

that our formulation leading to the instanton relations (3.30) and (3.31) by the gener-

alized topological yang-mills formulation will never lead the the kind of relation (3.34).
instead it may lead to the relations where  can get constant shift:    + v which is
dierent from (3.34). therefore the instanton solutions obtained from the generalized

topological yang-mills formulation are not nielsen-olesen vortex type solution but the

dimensionally reduced one derived from four-dimensional seiberg-witten equations.

we now derive the gauge-xed action with instanton relations (3.30) and (3.31) as

gauge xing conditions together with the following landau type gauge xing conditions

to x usual gauge symmetry and the reducible symmetry,

 = 0,

ec  = 0.

(3.35)

correspondingly we introduce a set of antighost elds , a,  and c, and associated

lagrange multipliers, e, a,  and . these elds obey the following closed brst

11

subalgebra,

s = e,

sa = a,

s = ,

sc = ,

se = 0,

sa = 0,

s = 0,

s = 0,

(3.36)

where the anti-self-dual eld a obeys the condition 

obeys the same condition.

a

bb = a and a also

we then obtain the following completely gauge-xed action by adding the brst-

exact terms:

sg-f = s0 + sz d2x( + (cid:16) 1

2

f  ||2  e(cid:17)  a(cid:16)(d)a()  a(cid:17)
+ec  + c),

(3.37)

where  and  are arbitrary parameters. using the equations of motions for auxiliary

4, we can eliminate
topological sectors and then we obtain the physical yang-mills action plus fermion

elds a and e and choosing the parameters  =  1

8 and  = 1

interaction terms.

4 twisted n = 2 supersymmetric action

we rst summarize the twisting procedure of n = 2 superalgebra. the algebra of n =
2 supersymmetry without central extension is constructed by the following relations:

{q,i, q,j} = ij()p,

[j, p] = i

p,

[j, q,i] =

[r, q,i] =

i
2
i
2

(5)

q,i,

(5)i

jq,j,

[p, q,i] = [r, j] = [r, p] = 0.

(4.1)

here q,i are the generators of supersymmetry, where the indices (= 1, 2) and

i(= 1, 2) are lorentz spinor and internal spinor indices labeling two dierent n = 2
 = {1, 3}, where i are pauli matrices,
and 5 =  1 2. majorana fermion is a two-dimensional real representation of so(2), and the lorentz
spinor indices are lowered and raised by the charge conjugation matrix c = .

 our convention of hermite euclidean -matrices is ()

12

generators, respectively. we can take these operators to be majorana. p, j and r are

generators of translation, so(2) lorentz rotation and internal so(2)i rotation called

r-symmetry, representing spin and isospin rotation, respectively.

the above n = 2 superalgebra is transformed into the twisted n = 2 superalgebra

by the following procedure. the essential meaning of the topological twist is to identify

the isospinor indices as spinor indices. then the isospinor indices should then transform

as spinor under the lorentz transformation. this will then lead to the redenition of

the energy momentum tensor and the lorentz rotation generator.

we consider the energy momentum tensor t and the conserved current r asso-
ciated with r-symmetry. we then dene a new energy momentum tensor t  without
spoiling the conservation law by the following relation:

t  = t + r + r.

(4.2)

this modication of the energy momentum tensor leads to a redenition of the lorentz

rotation generator j,

j = j + r.

(4.3)

this rotation group is interpreted as the diagonal subgroup of so(2)  so(2)i. now
the supercharges have double spinor indices and thus can be decomposed into the

following scalar, pseudo scalar and vector components:

2(cid:16) 1
2
solving conversely, we obtain

qb + 2()



q +

 eq(cid:17).

qb = 2trq,
eq = 2tr(5q),

tr(q).

q =

1
2

(4.4)

(4.5)

the essence of the twisting procedure is reected to the fact that the spin 1/2 charge

having the rst spinor sux turns into the spin 0 or spin 1 charge by adding the isospin

1/2 charge, which can be understood by the above relations (4.3) and (4.4).

the part of the algebra including lorentz generator j in (4.1) can be rewritten in

terms of the new lorentz generators j in the following form:

[j, qb] = [j, eq] = 0,

13

[j, q] = i

q,

[j, p] = i

p,

(4.6)

where the scalar and vector nature of the fermionic charges measured by the new
lorentz generator j after the twist is obvious from these relations.

the following algebra together with the algebra (4.6) construct the twisted version

of n = 2 superalgebra,

q2

b = eq2 = 0,

{qb, eq} = {q, q} = 0,
{qb, q} = 2p,
{eq, q} = 2

[r, eq] =

[r, q] =

2

qb,



q,

[r, j] = [r, p] = 0.

(4.7)

here we identify the scalar charge qb as brst charge since it has a nilpotency

property.

it should be noted that the momentum operator is brst-exact, which

reects the characteristic of topological eld theory.

here we explicitly show that the partially gauge-xed action possesses twisted

n = 2 supersymmetry [1]. partially we mean to x the gauge of topological sym-

metry only and recover the so(2) gauge symmetry. we rst modify the gauge-xed

action (3.37) by adding another brst-exact term

and make all elds hermitian to assure the hermicity property of the action:

it is easy to see that kinetic terms of a, ec, , , a and eca are nondegenerate, while

indeed this action is invariant under the following so(2)

that of  is degenerate.

gauge transformations with a gauge parameter v:

b(b, ecb, b),

(4.9)

gauge = v,

gauge(a, eca, a) = 2va
gauge(ec, , , , ) = 0.

corresponding to the lagrangian given in (4.8), we can nd explicit transformations

of elds by the supercharges:

asa = [iaqa, ],

(4.10)

where sa = {s, s, s} and qa = {qb, eq, q}.

we rst point out that the action (4.8) is invariant under the following brst-like

fermionic transformations:

sa = eca,
s = ec,
seca = 2ia
sec = i,

s = 0.

these transformations are only on-shell nilpotent up to corresponding gauge transfor-

mations in (4.9)

s2 = igauge,

(4.12)

where gauge denotes a gauge transformation associated with a gauge parameter .

furthermore we nd that the action possesses the following fermionic vector sym-

metry:

these transformations satisfy the following anticommutation relations:

{s, s} = 2i  2igauge
{s, s} = 2igauge,

,

(4.14)

where these algebras are also satised on shell.

lastly we can introduce the fermionic pseudo scalar symmetry which are the partner

of the brst-like symmetry:

bsb = a

s = 
bsecb = 2ia,
sec = i

esa = a

these transformations lead to the following anticommutation relations:

{es, s} = 2i
{es,es} = 2igauge,
{es, s} = 0.

it is apparent from (4.12), (4.14) and (4.16), that the operators s, s and es obey the

twisted n = 2 supersymmetric algebra.

5 topological twist and dirac-kahler fermion

in this formulation we nd out very interesting correspondence. we point out that two

multiplets for the ghost elds and the multiplier elds (, ec, ) and (eca, a) can be

interpreted as dirac-kahler multiplets, as we shall see below.

in two-dimensional at euclidean spacetime, we introduce the following dirac-

kahler eld [7, 10]

 =  + dx +

(5.1)

where ,  and  are hermitian fermionic scalar, vector and antisymmetric tensor
eld, respectively. the base z 
() is a 2  2 matrix and can be expanded into the

following inhomogeneous forms:

z = 1 + t

 dx +

1

t

 dx  dx.

the coecient 

() can be equivalently rewritten as



() =

( +  +

5) ()



.

(5.2)

(5.3)

it is interesting to note the remembrance of the expansion relations of the fermionic

charge in (4.4) and the coecients of the dirac-kahler eld in (5.3). this could be

understood as the origin of the dirac-kahler interpretation of ghost elds. we then

nd that massless dirac equations are expressed as the following set of equations by

the use of antisymmetric tensor elds:

(d + ) = ()

()z 

() = 0,

(5.4)

where  is an adjoint operator  = d and the index  is a spinor one while the index
() is regarded as a avour one for two degenerate dirac fermions. the dirac-kahler

action which leads to the above equation of motion is dened by

s =

1

2z i  (d + )
=z d2xx()
=z d2xtr(cid:16)i(cid:17).

i()()

(5.5)

we now turn to describe ghost elds in terms of dirac-kahler elds. the kinetic

terms of these multiplets in the action (4.8) can be expressed as

z d2x(iec   iec  iaeca)
=z d2xtr(cid:16)i + i(cid:17),

where dirac-kahler elds  and  are given by

 = 1

 = 1

2 ( + ec  5),
2 (eca=1 + a=1  eca=25).

(5.6)

(5.7)

here we impose anti-self-dual conditions for a.

it is easy to see that the action

possess so(2) avour symmetry.

the nal expression of the twisted n = 2 supersymmetric action with dirac-kahler

fermions is

s =z d2x(cid:16) +

 4i1tr(5) + 4i2tr(55)
 i2atr(5) + i2btr(5)
+ 2(a2  b2)||2(cid:17),

(5.8)

where we denote   22 (a + b) and   1
22(a b) and the covariant derivative with
respect to the avour group on dirac-kahler eld  is given by d  +25. it
is worth to mention that this action is equivalent to the extended supersymmetric abelin

higgs system [14] and topological bogomolnyi theory [15] except for the symmetry

breaking potential.

as we have seen in the formulation, the fermionic elds appearing in the quanti-

zation procedure such as ghost elds turns into the dirac-kahler matter fermion. it

would be important to conrm algebraically that the dirac-kahler fermions tranform

as spinor elds and possess half-integral spin unlike the ghost elds.

redening the lorentz generator, we will perform a change of the spin of the

operators.
indeed we will assign r-quantum number integral and half-integral for
boson elds and fermion elds, respectively. the twisted n = 2 theory dened by j is

the topological eld theory, whose superalgebra corresponds to (4.6) and (4.7), while

the theory dened by j is n = 2 supersymmetric eld theory.

it is important to recognize that in the present model we can identify the r-

symmetry as the avour symmetry of the dirac-kahler elds

r = (cid:16) 1

2

5(cid:17),

r = (cid:16) 1

2

5(cid:17),

(5.9)

which should be compatible with the algebra (4.7). the origin of this identication is

again due to the resemblance of the relations between (4.4) and (5.3). in other words

this identication is originated from the observation that the second avour sux of the

18

dirac-kahler eld in eq. (5.3) has faithful correspondence with the second spinor sux

of the fermionic charge in eq. (4.4), which originally corresponds to the isospinor sux

of r-generator before the twist. then lorentz transformation on the dirac-kahler eld
 induced by j is

j  =

1

2(cid:16)  
= 

1
2

 ec(cid:17)

[5, ].

(5.10)

on the other hand the lorentz transformation induced by j = j  r is

j  = j   r

1
2

= 

5,

(5.11)

which precisely coincides with the lorentz transformation of spinor eld. this implies

that dirac-kahler eld is exactly transformed as spinors. we can obtain the same rela-

tion for . consequently we have found that the twisting mechanism in two-dimensional

n = 2 theory has been understood from the dirac-kahler fermion formulation and the

r-symmetry is nothing but the avour symmetry of the dirac-kahler fermion.

6 conclusions and discussions

we have investigated the generalized gauge theory from the topological eld theory

point of view. firstly we have extended the algebraic structure of brst transforma-

tion a la baulieu-singer and derived sets of brst invariant physical operators. this

extension ts naturally in the framework of the generalized gauge theory. the classical

elds, ghost elds, ghost for ghost elds, the dierential operator and brst operator

are treated in a unied way by the quaternion algebra. in particular commutator and

anti-commutator dierence in the algebra is automatically accomodated in the gener-

alized gauge theory formulation while this point is treated in an ad hoc way in the

previous treatments.

as a concrete example we have quantized the generalized topological yang-mills

action in two-dimensional at euclidean spacetime with the two-dimensional cliord

algebra as the simplest graded lie algebra. we have shown that the generalized topo-

logical yang-mills action is brst equivalent to the standard yang-mills action plus

fermionic ghost and lagrange multiplier terms by imposing the instanton relations

19

as the gauge xing conditions. it turns out that the instanton relations coincide with

the two-dimensional counterpart of the seiberg-witten relations dimensionally reduced

from four into two dimensions. the explicit topological solutions of the instanton re-

lations have been obtained [17]. the full twisted n = 2 supersymmetric algebra has

been examined for the gauge-xed action and explicit transformations of elds for the

fermionic charge family included brst charge has been obtained.

we found that the fermionic sector including ghost elds in the gauge-xed action

can be identied with the dirac-kahler fermions. the crucial observation is that the

r-symmetry of n = 2 supersymmetric action can be identied with the avour

symmetry of the dirac-kahler fermion action. then the ghost elds together with the

fermionic multiplier elds turn into matter fermions via twisting mechanism. on the

other hand the twisting mechanism is equivalent to the dirac-kahler fermion formu-

lation when we identify the r-symmetry and the avour symmetry. in this sense

we have found that the twisting mechanism is essentially equivalent to the generation

of matter fermions from fermionic ghosts via dirac-kahler fermion formulation. it is

interesting to see if this mechanism works even in higher dimensions.
