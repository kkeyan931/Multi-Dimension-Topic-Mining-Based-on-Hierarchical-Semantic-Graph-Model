abstract

non-perturbative renormalizability, or non-triviality, of the gauged nambu-jona-lasinio

(njl) model in four dimensions is examined by using non-perturbative (exact) renormal-
ization group in large nc limit. when running of the gauge coupling is asymptotically free
and slow enough, the two dimensional renormalized trajectory (subspace) spanned by the
four fermi coupling and the gauge coupling is found to exist, which implies renormaliz-
ability of the gauged njl model. in the case of xed gauge coupling, renormalizability of
the model turns out to be guaranteed by the line of the uv xed points. we discuss also
non-triviality of the gauged njl model extended to include higher dimensional operators
and correspondence with the gauge-higgs-yukawa system.

1. introduction

modern renormalization due primarily to wilson [1] in terms of the scaling of eective
lagrangians oers us quite intuitive understanding of renormalizability. as we scale down
to small momenta the eective lagrangian converges towards a nite dimensional sub-
manifold, which is called a renormalized trajectory, in the space of possible lagrangians.
if this renormalized trajectory is non-trivial, then the theory is called renormalizable; the
eective lagrangian is given in terms of a nite number of the renormalized couplings.
thus renormalizable theories come out as dynamical consequence in the eective theories
in this picture. this renormalizability in the language of renormalization group (rg)
ows was rstly demonstrated by polchinski [2]. he gave a proof of perturbative renor-
malizability of four dimensional 4 theories by using the so-called exact rg equation
,or the non-perturbative rg (nprg) equation. however the idea of renormalizability
itself is non-perturbative and expected to be applied beyond perturbation theory, as is
mentioned in his paper [2].

there have been known some examples of non-perturbatively renormalizable theories.
these theories have non-trivial continuum limit, or non-trivial renormalized trajectory,
nevertheless they are perturbatively non-renormalizable. four-fermi interaction models
[3] in less than four dimensions were shown to be non-perturbatively renormalizable in
1/n expansion [4, 5]. renormalizability of such a model is guaranteed by the presence of a
non-trivial uv xed point and the renormalized trajectory comes out from the xed point.
1 in four dimensions the non-trivial uv xed point is lost and the nambu-jona-lasinio
(njl) model [3] fails to be renormalizable.

interestingly, however, it was claimed subsequently by several people [6, 7, 8, 9] that
the njl model can be non-perturbatively renormalizable in four dimensions when the
fermions are coupled with gauge interaction. kondo et. al.
investigated the ladder
schwinger-dyson (sd) equations for the gauged njl models and discussed cuto depen-
dence in the low energy eective theories [6, 7]. on the other hand krasnikov and harada
et. al. found that the gauged higgs-yukawa theory in four dimensions becomes non-trivial
under a certain condition by analyzing one-loop rg equations in the large nc limit [8, 9].
the (gauged) njl model may be realized as a specic (gauged) higgs-yukawa theory sub-
ject to the so-called compositeness conditions [10]. it was shown [9] that non-triviality
of the corresponding gauge higgs-yukawa theory implies renormalizability of the gauged
njl model.

in this paper we study renormalizability of the gauged njl model in four dimensions
in the spirit of polchinski. namely we examine existence of the renormalized trajecto-
ries spanned by the four-fermi coupling and the gauge coupling by solving the nprg
equation. this would be the rst application of the nprg for study of non-perturbative
renormalizability in four dimensions. in general we have to truncate the rg equations
in some approximation scheme for non-perturbative analyses of the solutions. therefore
it will be a hard problem to give a rigorous proof of non-perturbative renormalizability.
here we perform the analyses in large n limit according to the paper [9] in order to make
our argument denite.

1non-linear sigma models in less than four dimensions also are known as non-perturbatively renor-

malizable models with similar structure [5].

dynamics of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the gauged njl model has
been minutely investigated mainly by solving the sd equations in the (improved) ladder
approximation [11, 6, 7]. through these analyses the phase structure and the anomalous
dimensions of this model were claried. recently, however, the method based on the
non-perturbative rg equations have been invented and been found quite ecient for
study of dynamical chiral critical behavior [12, 13]. in this framework the rather simple
beta functions lead directly to rg ows, phase diagrams, anomalous dimensions, etc. if
we truncate the beta functions so as to include only the ladder type corrections, then
these are found to reproduce the results obtained by solving the ladder sd equation.
however it should be noted that we may proceed beyond the ladder approximation in
this rg approach in a systematic way. in this paper we analyze such non-perturbative
rg equations in order to see the renormalized trajectories of the gauged njl models.

the njl model is understood as a higgs-yukawa theory subject to the compositeness
conditions imposed at some uv scale. however it has been shown in large n limit that
the extended njl model with minimal choice of three independent interaction terms
is fully equivalent to a higgs-yukawa theory [14]. the higgs-yukawa theory in four
dimensions is supposed to be trivial due to presence of the landau singularity, which
may be explicitly shown in large n limit. this implies that the non-trivial renormalized
trajectory does not exist in a rigorous sense. hence we do not take this theory non-
perturbatively renormalizable, even though perturbatively renormalizable. on the other
hand asymptotically free gauge interaction can promote the higgs-yukawa theory to be
a non-trivial one [8, 9]. provided the equivalence between the extended njl models and
the higgs-yukawa theories is hold in the presence of gauge interaction, the class of non-
trivial, or renormalizable, theories with four-fermi interactions should be wider than the
gauged njl models. we are going to discuss renormalizability of these extended theories
also.
in practice, the nprg equations for the gauged njl models describe evolution
of the extended models as well, since the general possible interactions should be equally
incorporated in this framework.

in the next section rst let us analyze the exact rg equations for large n vector models
as a simple example in order to discuss renormalized trajectories and non-perturbative
renormalizability. in section 3 we give the ow equations for the gauged njl model and
show the critical phase structure obtained from these equations. section 4 is devoted
to our main argument for non-perturbative renormalizability of the gauged njl model.
we discuss renormalizability of the extended gauged njl models and relation to the
gauge-higgs-yukawa theory in section 5.

2. large n vector model and renormalizability

before starting the analyses of the gauged njl model, let us briey discuss the nprg
equations of o(n) vector models in large n limit in order to illustrate our strategy and
notion of non-perturbative renormalizability. we focus our attention on evolution of
the potential part and study the wegner-houghton rg equation with sharp cuto [15].
for large n vector model in d dimensions the rg equation for the potential v () ( =
(1/2)(i)2, i = 1,    , n) is given by

dv
dt

= dv + (2  d)v + a ln(1 + v),

(1)

2

where we introduced the scale parameter t = ln(/) with the cuto scale  and the
renormalization scale  and numerical factor a = d/22d/(d/2). this rg equation
turns out to be exact in large n limit [15, 16]. if we expand the eective potential v ()
around its minimum [17, 16];

v (; ) = v0() +

eq.(3) simply gives the critical surface at 0 = a/2. the theories in continuum limit must
reside in this surface. it is easy to see existence of the renormalized trajectory in (4, 6)
space with these simple rg equations. in four dimension eq.(4) is solved as

4() =

4()

1  a4() ln(/)

,

which gives renormalization of 4. eq.(5) also can be easily solved by rewriting it to

if we naively make cuto  innity, then 6() is determined by a nite function f in
terms solely of the renormalized coupling 4(). this function gives the renormalized
trajectory in this space. similarly all other couplings are determined by 4() in the
innite cuto limit, which is expected for renormalizable theory.

however the above argument is not totally correct, since we cannot take innite cuto
limit, or continuum limit, due to the landau pole appearing in eq.(6). therefore the
eective coupling 6() suers from ambiguity of order of (/)2 = exp(2/a4()). 3

2the legendre ow equations [18] give the same equations up to the coecients in the beta functions.
3 perturbative calculation is blind to such a non-perturbative eect. renormalization may be per-

formed by taking innite cuto limit in perturbative calculation [2].

3

thus we should say that the large n vector model is not non-perturbatively renormal-
izable, though renormalizable perturbatively.
in other words there is no renormalized
trajectory in this model.

3. flow equations

there have been proposed several formulations of the nprg equations, which are
found to be mutually equivalent. we employ the formulation called the legendre ow
equation [18]. this nprg equation gives the change of the ir cuto 1pi eective action
under the scale variation leaving the low energy physics unaltered.

first let us derive the legendre flow equation briey in the case of a single scalar eld
for simplicity. appropriate generalization to other kinds of the elds is straightforward,
see appendix. we start with the generating functional of ir cuto connected green
functions:

ew[j] = z d e 1

2 c1

 s []+j ,

(9)

where c is the additive smooth cuto for the lower momentum modes than scale . from
eq.(9), we can obtain the variation of w[j] with respect to the cuto  as

(15)

the right hand side of eq.(14) may be regarded as sum of one-loop graphs by expand-
ing the inverse matrix with respect to the cuto propagator >. thus the beta functions
of the couplings are easily evaluated. in general, however, the ow equations for the in-
nitely many couplings are intertwined each other. therefore it is necessary to truncate
the series of the couplings by some approximation scheme so as to solve the equations.

the chiral critical behavior of the gauged njl models has been examined by applying
the legendre ow equations [12, 13]. the rg ow of the four-fermi coupling of njl type

4

plays an essential role to determine the phase. in the large n (and ladder) approximation,
which is adopted in the later considerations the ow equations are reduced to be rather
simple. in fig.1 and fig.2 the rg ows projected on the space of the four-fermi coupling
and the gauge coupling are shown in the case that the gauge coupling is xed and is
asymptotically free respectively [13]. these should be compared with those obtained by
solving the sd equations [11, 6, 7]. in ref.[12] the gauge independent ow equations for all
the chirally invariant four-fermi interactions have been derived in a certain approximation
scheme better than the large n and ladder.

boundary of the gauged njl model with
xed gauge coupling shown in the (g2, g4)
plane.

fig.2: rg ows of the gauged njl model
with asymptotically free gauge coupling
shown in the (g2, g4) plane. the bold
line represent the renormalized trajectory
of qcd projected on this plane.

it is seen from fig.1 that there are two phases in the gauged njl model with xed
gauge coupling. the upper (lower) region is found to be chirally broken (unbroken) phase
[13]. as long as the four-fermi coupling is concerned, the critical surface of the phase
boundary appears to be a line of uv xed points. the theories possessing an uv xed
point are renormalizable, since there should exist the renormalized trajectories subject to
the xed point. therefore it is supposed that the gauged njl model is also renormalizable.
however it is necessary to examine the rg ows of other couplings than the four-fermi
as well in order to conrm the uv xed points and the renormalizability in this model.
when we take account of the asymptotically free evolution of the gauge coupling, the
phase boundary is washed out as is seen in fig.2. qcd has a non-trivial continuum
limit given by the renormalized trajectory subject to the gaussian xed point, which is
shown by the bold line in fig.2. however other ows of the gauged njl models do not
seem to converge on the renormalized trajectory of qcd. the four-fermi couplings of

5

all these ows start at the critical point of the njl model in the uv limit. therefore
it may be supposed that these ows are on another renormalized trajectory subject to
the non-trivial uv xed point. if so, the gauged njl models oers non-perturbatively
renormalizable theories dierent from qcd.

in the next section we are going to examine the renormalizability of these theories by
studying behavior of the rg ows. the clue observation is to see existence of the non-
trivial uv xed point and the renormalized trajectories. for this purpose it is enough to
clarify the rg ows in the region of weak gauge coupling. hence we are going to evaluate
the beta functions in the lowest non-trivial order of gauge coupling in the followings.

now we are going to present the ow equations for the su(nc) gauged njl model in
the leading order of 1/nc expansion, which will be investigated in the next section. let us
introduce nf avors of fermions in the fundamental representation i(i = 1,    , nf ), and
assume nf is order of nc so as to tune the gauge beta function in large nc limit. also we
assume that only n ( o(1)) species among them have four-fermi interactions according
to harada et.al.[9]. here we restrict the four-fermi interaction to the gross-neveu type
[3] for simplicity. namely our starting bare lagrangian at scale  is given by

(16)

in general quantum corrections generate all the operators consistent with the symme-
try of the system in the eective lagrangian. here, however, we may treat gauge coupling
perturbatively, since we are interested in the high energy asymptotic region (g2  1). in
the large nc limit the eective lagrangian at scale  is found to be given by the following
form:

l =

no other interactions such as ( )2 are generated in the large nc limit.

the legendre ow equations for the gauged njl model may be obtained by substi-
tuting the above lagrangian into eq.(13). however it will be found that the rg ows for
the couplings (g2, g4, g
4, g8) are relevant to examine renormalizability. therefore let us
show the ow equations only for these couplings, which are found to be

evaluating the one-loop diagrams schematically shown in fig.3. it should be noted that
higher dimensional multi-fermi operators do not aect evolution of the lower dimensional
ones. hence we may solve these equations order by order without truncation. the deriva-
tion of eq.(18)-eq.(21) and the explicit values of the coecients are given in appendix.

4. renormalizability of the gauged njl model

now let us analyze the solution of the rg ow equations given by eq.(18)-(21) to
see renormalizability of the gauged njl model. for this purpose we x the renormalized
couplings g2() and g4() at some scale   . also the bare couplings other than g()
and g4() are set to zero. note that the renormalized trajectory of qcd is given by
g4() = 0, since we ignored o(g4) corrections in the ow equations.

first we give (g2(), g4()) explicitly in terms of the renormalized couplings. solution

of eq.(18) is the well-known one;

g2() =

g2()

1 + bg2() ln(/)

,

(22)

which shows asymptotically free running of the gauge coupling. eq.(19) may be solved by
using the trick illustrated in section 2. assuming that g4 is positive and non-vanishing,
which is the case of our present interest, eq.(19) can be rewritten as

d

dt (cid:18)g2c/b 1

g4(cid:19) = 2g2c/b 1

 wg2c/b.

(23)

the solution of this equation is easily found to be

(24)

from which we can see cuto dependence of the bare coupling g4(). in the innite cuto
limit, g4() is found to take a nite value;

(25)

thus it is seen that all the ows with g4() > 0 are found to approach to the njl
critical coupling g
4 = 2/w in uv limit. it is seen from eq.(24) also that if we perform
perturbative calculation, the bare coupling diverges more than quadratically as cuto
goes to innity. such divergence is tamed away by non-perturbative sum of radiative
corrections.

next we examine the rg ow equations for g

4 and g8; eq.(20) and eq.(21). by

noting that these equations are also rewritten into

we may easily derive the explicit form of the solutions in terms of g2() and g4() given
in eq.(22) and eq.(24). they are found to be

where dependence on the bare couplings g
4() and g8() are also given for the later
discussions. in order for the gauged njl model to be renormalizable, there have to exist
the renormalized trajectory determined by the renormalized couplings g2() and g4().
this means that the integrations in eq.(28) and in eq.(29) should converge as  goes to
innity. to see this let us evaluate the rst derivatives with respect to cuto at   ;

from these equations the conditions for convergence are found to be

(32)
(33)

note that the convergence is quite slow due to logarithmic damping, which is clear dier-
ence from power damping behavior of irrelevant couplings around a xed point.

so far we have been concerned with evolution of only the three eective couplings
(g4, g
4, g8) for fermionic operators with less dimensions. in principle, however, we need
to examine cuto dependence of all other eective couplings to see renormalizability.
actually it would be seen that the cuto dependence of other couplings decays with
power behavior. here let us show convergence of g12 coupling of ( )6 only. the beta
function of g12 in the present approximation scheme is given by

by performing similar manipulation we may nd the solution for g12() as follows

it is seen that the cuto dependence of g12 is quadratically suppressed and g12() con-
verges rapidly to a nite value as  goes to innity. cuto independence of other higher
couplings may be shown also inductively.

thus the renormalized trajectory (subspace) given by the ow equations is found to
be determined with (g4, g
4, g8) and gauge coupling in general. in the case of b < c this
subspace is reduced to the two dimensional one spanned by g2 and g4. the aspect of
convergence to the renormalized trajectory will be seen from the ow diagrams projected
on (g2, g
4) plane and (g2, g8) plane as shown in fig.4 for c = 3b. the renormalized
trajectory is shown by the bold lines. the renormalized trajectory goes to innity of the
coupling space rapidly as the gauge coupling approaches to 0. in fig.5 the rg ows for
c = 0.1b are also shown.

thus the gauged njl model turns out to be non-perturbatively renormalizable when
the coecients of the beta functions satisfy b < c [9, 6, 8]. however this does not means
that there are no renormalizable theories unless b < c.
if we allow renormalization of
couplings g
4 and/or g8, then we could obtain other classes of renormalized theories with
non-trivial continuum limit. we are going to discuss this point in the next section.

for the xed gauge coupling the line of xed points appears and aspect of the ow
diagram is rather dierent from the asymptotically free case. 4 the solutions of the ow

4rather the ow diagram is similar to the njl model in d < 4, which is known to be renormalizable

in 1/n expansion.

4(g) = (2  cg2)/w is the xed line coupling. this solution implies that 1/g4 is
where g
relevant with dimension 2  cg2 around the xed line. by using the relation eq.(36) in
eq.(30) and in eq.(31) it is seen that cuto dependence of g
4 and g8 in turn decays with
power law as long as the gauge coupling is non-vanishing;

model with xed gauge coupling is described by renormalized trajectory coming out from
the xed point and the theory is clearly renormalizable.

5. extension of the gauged njl model

in the previous section we saw that the renormalized trajectory of the gauged njl
model is determined by the renormalized gauge coupling and the four fermi coupling,
when c > b. in other cases, g
4 and/or g8 diverge in the innite cuto limit, however
other couplings for the higher dimensional operators remain irrelevant. therefore we may
suppose that the renormalized trajectory of the theory with c  b, if it exists, is enlarged so
as to be determined by the renormalized couplings (g2, g4, g
4, g8). this implies that there
can be a larger class of renormalizable theories, if we allow to renormalize the couplings
g
4 and g8 as well. however the extended njl models with any renormalized couplings
(g2, g4, g
4, g8) will be seen not always renormalizable, even though all the other higher
dimensional operators are irrelevant. specially the njl model without gauge interaction
cannot be made renormalizable by extension. in this section we discuss what kinds of the
extended njl models can be renormalizable.

indeed this issue is related with non-triviality of the gauge-higgs-yukawa theories

[8, 9];

the gauged njl models discussed in the previous section are known to be equivalent to the

11

gauge-higgs-yukawa theories subject to the compositeness condition at some composite
scale  [10];

(41)

however hasenfratz et. al. claimed that the extended njl models with three independent
fermionic interactions are equivalent to the higgs-yukawa theories without such condition
in large n limit [14]. the green functions in those theories are made to be the same
through identication of the renormalized coupling constants.

such matching between the eective couplings in these theories can be explicitly seen
also by the exact rg equations. by similar calculation done in section 3 the rg equations
for the dimensionless couplings of the gauge-higgs-yukawa theory are found to be 5

(44)

where we truncated the eective action to the perturbatively renormalizable one given by
eq.(40). actually these equations are found to be transformed into the rg equations for
the gauged njl model given by eq.(19)-(21) through the following non-linear relations;

m2

y2 ,

g

(45)

however the last terms in eq.(20) and in eq.(21) are not reproduce these relations though
their contribution to the eective couplings are irrelevant for the arguments of renormal-
izability. these terms are supposed to be related with radiative corrections to the higher
dimensional operators, 2  and 3  in the gauge-higgs-yukawa theory discarded in
the above calculation. here, however, let us just neglect these subleading contributions.
it should be also noted that the compositeness conditions given by eq.(41) are nothing
but the requirement of vanishing g

4 and g8 at scale .

thus there exists a mapping between the rg ows of the extended gauged njl model
and of the gauge-higgs-yukawa theory. especially the renormalized trajectory of the
gauged njl model discussed in the previous section corresponds to the solution of the so-
called coupling constant reduction [19] in the gauge-higgs-yukawa theory. in the theories
along this ow y() and () are completely determined by the gauge coupling g() and
both are asymptotically free. this renormalized trajectory in the gauge-higgs-yukawa
theory, which is infrared attractive by its denition, is also known as the pendleton-ross
(pr) xed point [20].

harada et. al. investigated triviality and stability bound for the gauge-higgs-yukawa
theory by solving the rg equations eq.(43) and eq.(44) with eq.(18) [9]. they found
that the allowed region of the renormalized couplings (y, ) survive on a line connecting

5the form of these ow equations are same as those examined in ref.[9]. the beta function for the

scalar mass of this form is obtained in mass dependent renormalization scheme.

the gaussian xed point and the pr xed point in the innite cuto limit as long as
c > b, as is shown in fig.3 in ref.[9]. now these theories are parametrized by renormalized
couplings g2, m and y. therefore this result implies that there are non-trivial or non-
perturbatively renormalizable theories with three renormalized couplings g2, g4 and g
4
among the extended gauged njl models when c > b. the coupling correspondence given
by eq.(45) tells us the conditions which these non-trivial theories should satisfy at the
cuto scale are 6

0  g

4(),

0  g8() < .

(46)

indeed it is seen from eq.(28) and eq.(29) that continuum limit with these boundary
conditions may be taken only if c > b. the renormalized g
4 o the renormalized trajectory
of the gauged njl model is achieved by tuning the bare coupling g
4() properly. it is
supposed that these conditions should be imposed on the extended njl model so as to
satisfy unitarity and stability for collective excitations of  bound state.

appendix

in this appendix we derive the ow equations given by eq.(18)-eq.(21) with explicit
coecients. to this end, we rst advance eq.(13) to a more appropriate form for our
analysis. let us dene the propagator and the vertex as

p 1 = 1 + 1c,

f =

then eq.(13) becomes

(a.3)

next we rewrite the eq.(a.3) in terms of the dimensionless quantities by canonical scaling.
also we perform wave function renormalization so that the kinetic term is always normal-
ized. by taking account of wave function renormalization it is convenient to introduce
the following form of the cuto function.

c 1
 (p, q) = zc 1(q2/2)2(2)44(p + q).

(a.4)

6the stability bound of the scalar potential ()  0 is mapped to g8()  0. the triviality bound
implies that g8() <  should be imposed. however, this bound in the gauge-higgs-yukawa theory may
be obtained by assuming triviality of pure 4 theory in four dimensions, which is not seen in the large
nc analysis. at present it is unclear to us how this triviality bound may be imposed to the extended
gauged njl model.

(a.5)

the rst line of eq.(a.5), where  denotes the anomalous dimension dened by  =
d(ln z)/d, represents nothing but the canonical scaling of the cuto eective action.

by expanding the inverse matrix in the second line as

(cid:16)p 1 + f(cid:17)1

= p  pf p + pf pf p     .

(a.6)

we may obtain the beta function for each coupling by comparing the coecients of each
operator on the both sides of eq.(a.5). each term, which is regarded as a one-loop
feynman graph, can be evaluated by giving c, p, and f .

for the gauged njl model of our present concern we need treat fermions as well as
bosons. then the elements appearing in the legendre ow equation, c, p, and f become
matrices in {a, , } space. tr is replaced with str. as we notice that c(p, q) =
c(q)(2)44(p + q) and p(p, q) = p(q)(2)44(p + q), in the large nc limit these matrices
found to be given as follows;

where we used the landau gauge propagator for the gauge eld. note that there is no

we substitute these matrices for the legendre ow equation, then calculating the part of
the radiative corrections of the legendre ow equation return in calculating the feynman
graph given in fig.3. it is straightforward to obtain the results eq.(19)-eq.(21) by using
the technique of the derivative expansion [21]. the coecients in the beta functions are
given by the following form;
