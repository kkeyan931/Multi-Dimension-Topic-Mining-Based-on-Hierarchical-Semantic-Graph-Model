comoving entropy density models constant.1 order formulate 1this discussion, like fischler susskind, assumes open uni- verse necessarily expands indenitely, closed universe recollapses nite time. however, spatially open universe negative vacuum energy density (cos- mological constant) recollapse, positive vacuum energy cause closed universe expand indenitely. discussion easily generalized

initially, condition satised later times, provided xed less unity {$9806039$}. additional assumptions, also bound s/a early times. example, consider energy density entropy density relativistic gas
