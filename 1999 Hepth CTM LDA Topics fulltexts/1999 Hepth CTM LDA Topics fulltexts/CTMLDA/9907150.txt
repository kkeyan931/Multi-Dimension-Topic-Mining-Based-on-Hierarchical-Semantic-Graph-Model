(remember ep p = h/2). precendent derivation, making use stefan-boltzmann law, takes 3 account pure electromagnetic black body emission (i.e. photons). order consider also particles species, introduce multi- channels correction factor, fc. equation (4) reads dm = fc 2 dt (9) fc accounts degrees freedom emitted particle specie contributing energy loss. various forms proposed fc . standard model picture fc never exceeds value order 102 (and also supersymmetric picture fc order magnitude). equation (8) hence becomes t0p 2.01 103 fc p . (10) note that, absence gravitational eects, energy uctuation size planckian micro hole would lifetime one planck time (if take account heisenberg principle only). decay time slowed presence event horizon micro hole, traps energy emits slow rate via hawking evaporation. thus consider quantum micro hole, lifetime order 20p , sort metastable quantum state. theory decay metastable states  infer decay probability dp state time interval (t, + dt) proportional exp (11) width energy state. mean lifetime state = h .
