abstract

topological property in a spinning system should be directly associated

with its wavefunction. a complete decomposition formula of su (2) gauge

potential in terms of spinning wavefunction is established rigorously. based

on the -mapping theory and this formula, one proves that the second chern

class is inherent in the spinning system.

it is showed that this topological

invariant is only determined by the hopf index and brouwer degree of the

spinning wavefunction.

i. introduction

topology now becomes absolutely necessary in physics [14]. the -mapping theory

and the gauge potential decomposition theory [5,6] are found to be signicant in exhibiting

the topological structure of physics systems [710]. topological properties of a quantum

system should be directly associated with its wavefunction. in our previous paper hep-th\

9908168, based on -mapping theory and gauge potential decomposition theory, we reveal

the inner relation between the topological property of schrodinger system and the intrinsic

properties of its wavefunction. we point out that a topological invariant, the rst chern

class, is inherent in the schrodinger system, which is only associated with the wave function.

this intrinsic relation is the topological source of the inner structure of london equations

in superconductor [10].

in this paper, we extend our work to spinning system. based on the gauge potential

decomposition theory, we investigate the su(2) gauge potential in terms of the spinning

wavefunction. the complete decomposition formula of the su(2) gauge potential is obtained

rigorously. by making use of this result, the second chern class is studied. one proves

that the second chern class is exclusively labeled by the topological index of the spinning

wavefunction without using any particular models or hypotheses. in other words, one shows

that the second chern class is inherent in spinning system. this relation between chern

class and wavefunction is intrinsic property of quantum system, and gives a basic concept

in topological quantum mechanics.

ii. su (2) gauge potential in terms of spinning wavefunction

considering a spinning wavefunction  = 


denoted as

1

2




, we have the convariant derivative

d = d  a,

(1)

2

where a = i

2aaa (a = 1, 2, 3) is a su(2) gauge potential, and a is the pauli matrices. its

complex conjugate is given by

d+ = d+ + +a,

(2)

in which + = (cid:18) 1 2 (cid:19) . by making use of the equation

ab + ba = 2iab,

one can prove that

aa = 

i

+

[(+ad  d+a)  (+ad  d+a)].

(3)

from this formula, it can be proved that

aa = 

i

+

t r(d+a  d+a) +

i

+

t r(d+a  d+a).

(4)

using the properties of pauli matrices and considering t r(a) = 0, we can obtain that

a =

1

+

[(d+  d+)  t r(d+  d+)i]



1

+

[(d+  d+)  t r(d+  d+)i].

(5)

from (5), it is easy to prove that a satises the gauge transformation

under the su(2) transformation



a

= sas1 + dss1,





= s, 

+ = +s +.

here, we know that s + = s1.

the main feature of the decomposition theory of the gauge potential is that the gauge

potential a can be generally decomposed as [5,6,11]

a = a + b,

3

where a and b are required to satisfy the following respective transformation

a = sas1 + dss1,

b = sbs1.

investigating eq. (5), one nds that the su(2) gauge potential can be decomposed as

a =

1

+

[(d+  d+)  t r(d+  d+)i],

and

b = 

1

+

[(d+  d+)  t r(d+  d+)i],

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

which satisfy the eqs. (6) and (7) respectively. we know that the topological property is

independent with the choice of the gauge potential [4]. so, we can take a as

a =

1

+

[(d+  d+)  t r(d+  d+)i].

(10)

one can regard it as a special gauge. in fact, this choice is equal to the common condition,

d = 0, which is often used in studying spinning problem.

on the other hand, the spinning wavefunction can be denoted as

 = 


1 + i2

3 + i4

,




where a(a = 1, 2, 3, 4) are real function. one can regard the spinning wavefunction as the

complex representation of a vector eld ~ = (1, 2, 3, 4). let us dene a unit vector ~n as

na =

a
||||

,

|||| = (aa)

1

2 = (+)

1

2 ,

and

nana = 1.

4

(11)

(12)

if we denote that

then one has

n = 


n1 + in2

n3 + in4




, n + = (cid:18) n1  in2 n3  in4 (cid:19) ,

n +n = nana = 1

the expression (10) can be rewrote as

a = (ndn +  dnn +)  t r(ndn +  dnn +)i.

(13)

(14)

iii. the second chern class inherits in spinning system

we know that the unit vector ~n can be expressed in terms of cliord algebra [12,13] as

with n0 = n4, and where

n = nasa,

a = 0, 1, 2, 3.

s = (i, i~),

s = (i, i~).

then one can rewrite (12) as

nn = 1.

(15)

(16)

(17)

if we choose the spinor as  = 


a given in (14) has the expression as

1  i2

3  i4

, it can be proved that the gauge potential




a = dnn .

(18)

it is interesting that this result is the same as the decomposition formula of the su(2) gauge

potential in terms of a four-dimensional vector eld which we have obtained in [11].

one knows that the second chern class can be wrote in terms of chern-simon [4,14]

c2(p ) =

82 d,

and

 =

1

82 t r(cid:18)a  da 

2
3

a  a  a(cid:19)

which is known as chern-simon form [15].

substituting (18) into (19) and considering (17), we obtain

c2(p ) =

1
242 t r(dn  dn  dn  dn).

from (15), one gets

c2(p ) =

=

1

242  nanbncndt r(cid:16)sas
1
122 abcd nanbncnddx4.

bscs

d(cid:17) dx4

by substituting (11) into (22), and considering

dna =

da
||||

+ ad  1

||||! ,

we have

c2(p ) = 

1
42

2

aa  1

||||2!d (/x) d4x,

where d(/x) is the jacobian dened as

abcd d (/x) = abcd.

by means of the general green function formula

2

aa   1

||||2! = 44(cid:16)~(cid:17) ,

we get

c2(p ) = 4(cid:16)~(cid:17) d (/x) d4x.

(26)

(27)

suppose a(x) (a = 0, 1, 2, 3) have m isolated zeros at x = zi

 (i = 1, 2,   , m) ,

according to the -function theory [2], (~) can be expressed by

and one then obtains

(~) =

i(~x  ~zi)
|d(/x)|~x=~zi

,

m

xi=1

c2(p ) =

m

xi=1

ii4 (x  zi) d4x,

(28)

(29)

where i is a positive integer (the hopf index of the ith zeros ) and i is the brouwer degree

[16]:

i =

d (/x)
|d (/x) |

= sgn[d (/x)]|x=zi = 1.

(30)

the meaning of the hopf index i is that the vector eld function ~ covers the correspond-

ing region i times while ~x covers the region neighborhood of zero zi once. from above

discussion, the chern density (x) is dened as :

(x) =

m

xi=1

ii4 (x  zi) ,

(31)

which shows that the topological structure of chern density  is labeled by the brouwer

degrees and the hopf index. the integration of (x)

c2 = z (x)d4x =

ii

m

xi=1

(32)

is integer called chern number which is a topological invariant.

the result (32) suggests that the topological invariant is determined only by the zero

points of the vector eld ~, i.e. the zeroes of the spinning wavefunction . the topological

indexes of zero points are intrinsic properties of the wavefunction, so the topological invariant

given in (32) is naturally inherent in the spinning system.

iv. discussion

based on the gauge potential decomposition method, we established the gauge potential

decomposition theory in terms of the spinning wavefunction. one nds that the su(2) gauge

7

potential can be completely decomposed by the wavefunction of spinning system. by making

use of the -mapping theory, we reveal that the second chern class is naturally inherent

in spinning system, which is only associated with the intrinsic properties of the spinning

wavefunction, and labeled by the topological indexes of the wavefunction. we believe that

this intrinsic topological property is a fundamental property of quantum system and is

the source of many topological eects in quantum system. this gives a new concept in

topological quantum mechanics.
