abstract

duality transformations involving compactications on timelike as well as spacelike

circles link m-theory, the 10+1-dimensional strong coupling limit of iia string theory, to

other 11-dimensional theories in signatures 9+2 and 6+5 and to type ii string theories in

all 10-dimensional signatures. these theories have bps branes of various world-volume

signatures, and here we construct the world-volume theories for these branes, which in each

case have 16 supersymmetries. for the generalised d-branes of the various type ii string

theories, these are always supersymmetric yang-mills theories with 16 supersymmetries,

and we show that these all arise from compactications of the supersymmetric yang-mills

theories in 9+1 or 5+5 dimensions. we discuss the geometry of the brane solutions and, for

the cases in which the world-volume theories are superconformally invariant, we propose

holographically dual string or m theories in constant curvature backgrounds. for product

space solutions x  y , there is in general a conformal eld theory associated with the
boundary of x and another with the boundary of y .

1. introduction

duality maps relate the ve distinct perturbative string theories in 9+1 dimensions

[1,2], and these are now understood as dierent limits of a theory in 10+1 dimensions, the

so-called m-theory. for the purposes of this paper, we will dene m-theory as the 10+1

dimensional theory arising as the strong-coupling limit of the iia string theory. in [3,4],

this picture was expanded to include dualities involving compactication on timelike circles

as well as spacelike ones. in [3], it was shown that t-duality on a time-like circle takes the

iia theory into a iib* theory and the iib theory into a iia* theory. the strong coupling

limit of the iia* theory is a theory in 9+2 dimensions, denoted the m* theory in [4],

which can also be obtained by compactifying m-theory on a lorentzian 3-torus t 2,1 with 2

spacelike circles and one timelike one, and taking the limit in which all three circles shrink

to zero size. compactifying the m* theory on a euclidean 3-torus t 3 and shrinking the

torus to zero size then gives an m theory in 6+5 dimensions. compactifying the m, m*,

m theories on spacelike or timelike circles gives rise to iia-like string theories in signatures

10+0, 9+1, 8+2, 6+4 and 5+5, and t-dualities relate these to iib-like string theories in

signatures 9+1, 7+3 and 5+5. each of these theories has 32 local supersymmetries, which

in some cases satisfy a twisted supersymmetry algebra [4], and each has a supergravity

limit. these theories are linked by an intricate web of duality transformations which can

change the number of time dimensions as well as the number of space dimensions. as all

of these theories are linked by dualities, they should all be regarded as dierent limits of

a single underlying theory. for a review, see [5].

in [6], the generalised brane-type solutions of these theories were constructed, and

found to have various world-volume signatures. for example, the 9+2 dimensional m*

theory has membrane-type solutions with world-volumes of signature (3,0) and (1,2) and

a solitonic vebrane-type solution with signature (5,1). the rules for determining which

signature branes appear in which theories were given in [6], as well as the duality transfor-

mations relating the various generalised branes. these were found to be consistent with

2

considerations of dimensional reduction from 11 to 10 dimensions.

there are of course many issues arising concerning the interpretation of these theories

with multiple times, some of which are discussed in [3,4,5]. here we will proceed formally

and continue to map out the structure of the theories that arise.

the plan of this paper is as follows: in section 2, we review the d-brane and e-brane

solutions of the type ii and type ii* string theories and discuss their singularities.

in

section 3, we review some of the main results of [6], emphasizing the various brane solutions

obtained in 10 and 11 dimensions. in section 4, we interpret the branes as interpolating

solutions, summarizing the results in eleven dimensions found in [6] and explicitly writing

the interpolating geometries for the family of four-dimensional brane solutions of the ten-

dimensional type iib theories.

in section 5, we discuss world-volume actions for these

generalized branes, noting that each can be linked to a standard brane of m-theory. in

sections 6,7 and 8 we discuss the world-volume theories of the d-branes of the various

type ii theories, and the m-branes of the m-type theories. finally, in section 9 we discuss

the dualities between conformal eld theories and de sitter space theories following the

arguments of maldacena [7].

various generalised de sitter spaces of various signatures arise in solutions of these

theories [6], all of which are coset spaces so(p, q)/so(p 1, q) with the so(p, q)-invariant
metric and signature (p  1, q); when these have two sheets, we take one connected com-
ponent. these include d-dimensional de sitter space

and the space

aadsd =

so(d  1, 2)
so(d  2, 2)

,

(1.5)

with two-timing signature (d  2, 2).

2. d-branes and e-branes

the iia* and iib* theories in 9+1 dimensions contain e-branes [3], which are the

images of d-branes under timelike t-duality. whereas d-branes are timelike planes on

which strings can end, the e-branes are spacelike surfaces on which strings can end. the

strings ending on the e-branes govern the behaviour of the e-branes, and the zero-slope

limit of this string theory gives world-volume theories which are euclidean super-yang-

mills theories obtained by reducing 9+1 dimensional super-yang-mills on lorentzian tori.

in particular, the e4-brane solution of the iib* theory leads, following [7], to a duality

between the large n limit of euclidean 4-dimensional u (n ) super-yang-mills theory and

the iib* string on the product of the 5-dimensional de sitter space ds5 and the hyperbolic

5-space h5 [3].

(2.2)

here  is the dilaton, h = db2 is the eld strength of the ns-ns 2-form gauge eld

b2 and gn+1 = dcn + . . . is the eld strength for the rr n-form gauge eld cn. the

4

eld equations derived from the iib action (2.2) are supplemented with the self-duality

constraint g5 = g5. our conventions are that in signature s + t , the metric has s
positive spacelike eigenvalues and t negative timelike ones, so that a lorentzian metric

has signature (s, 1), i.e. (+ + . . . + ).

the type ii supergravity solution for a dp-brane (p is even for iia and odd for iib)

is given by [9,10,11]

ds2 = h 1/2(dt2 + dx2
e2 = h (p3)/2,

p) + h 1/2(dy2

1 + . . . + dx2
c012...p = h 1 + k,

p+1 + . . . + dy2
9)

(2.3)

where h is a harmonic function of the transverse coordinates yn+1, . . . , y9, k is a constant

and here and throughout in the paper we denote longitudinal spatial coordinates by xa

and transverse spatial coordinates by yi. the simplest choice for h is

h = c +

q
y7p ,

(2.4)

where c is a constant (which can be taken to be 0 or 1), y is the radial coordinate dened

by

y2 =

9

y2
i

xi=p+1

(2.5)

and q is proportional to the d-brane tension, and is taken to be positive (taking q < 0

gives an unphysical negative-tension brane with a naked singularity where h = 0). when
c 6= 0, it is conventional to set k = c1, so that as y  , c012...p  0. however, for
convenience we will henceforth set k = 0 and usually take c = 1.

the bosonic part of the type iia* and type iib* supergravity actions are given by

reversing the signs of the rr kinetic terms in (2.1),(2.2) to give [3]

where the eld equations from (2.7) are supplemented by the constraint g5 = g5. the
full theories are invariant under a twisted n = 2 supersymmetry [3].

the ep-brane solutions to (2.6) and (2.7) are given by

ds2 = h 1/2(dx2

1 + . . . + dx2

p) + h 1/2(dt2 + dy2

p+1 + . . . + dy2

9),

e2 = h (p4)/2,

c12...p = h 1.

(2.8)

in this case, h is a harmonic function of t, yp+1, . . . , y9 (i.e.
it is a solution of the wave
equation 2h = 0), and h can depend on time as well as the spatial transverse coordi-
nates.

there are a number of dierent possibilities for h. first, we can take the time-

independent h given by (2.4). these are the solutions that arise from the d-brane super-

gravity solutions on performing a timelike t-duality, using a generalisation [4] of the usual

t-duality rules [12],[13]. secondly, we can consider the solution [3]

h = c +

q

 8p

where ,  are the proper time and distance dened by

 2 = 2 = t2  y2.

(2.9)

(2.10)

this corresponds to a source located at a point in the transverse space-time. for odd p,

taking

h = c +

q
8p

(2.11)

gives a dierent real solution, related to (2.9) by taking q = iq.

the solutions have potential singularities on the light-cone t2 = y2, where h diverges,

and on the hyperboloid where h = 0. there are in general two distinct solutions, one
in which the coordinates are restricted to the interior of the light cone, t2  y2, and one
in which they are restricted to the exterior of the light cone, t2  y2. for example, for
the e4-brane, it was shown in [3] that the geometry near t2 = y2 is non-singular and

6

approaches ds5  h 5, the product of 5-dimensional de sitter space and hyperbolic 5-space
with constant negative-curvature and positive denite metric. taking q to be positive

(with c = 1) so that h is non-vanishing then avoids the potential singularity at h = 0.
the region t2  y2 then denes a non-singular solution which interpolates between at
space (the region in which  is large) and ds5  h 5 (where  is small), and is geodesically
complete [3]. the interior of the light-cone t2  y2 also denes a non-singular geodesically
complete solution, with the future and past regions t  0 and t  0 each giving a coordinate
patch covering half the space. the region near t2 = y2 is again ds5  h 5, with the future-
cone t > y > 0 covering one half of ds5 and the past-cone covering the other half [3]. the

situation is similar for the other e-branes, with the interior and exterior solutions dening
two dierent solutions [14]. for the solution with timelike interpolation in which t2  y2,
we take the harmonic function to be given by (2.9) with q > 0, while for the solution with
spacelike interpolation in which t2  y2, we take the harmonic function to be given by
(2.11) with q > 0, so that in each case h > 0.

the solution (2.8) is an extended object associated with a spacelike p-surface with

coordinates x1, . . . , xp located at t = yp+1 = . . . = y9 = 0. this is to be compared with

a d-brane, which is associated with a timelike p + 1-surface with coordinates t, x1, . . . , xp

located at yp+1 = . . . = y9 = 0. a d-brane arises in perturbative type ii string theory

from imposing dirichlet boundary conditions in the directions yp+1, . . . , y9 and neumann

conditions in the remaining directions, and the d-brane solution (2.3) describes the super-

gravity elds resulting from such a d-brane source. similarly, the e-brane in perturbative

type ii* string theory arises from imposing dirichlet boundary conditions in the directions

t, yp+1, . . . , y9, including time, and neumann conditions in the remaining directions, and

the e-brane solution (2.8) describes the supergravity elds resulting from such an e-brane

source. in the perturbative string theory, the timelike t-duality taking the type ii theory

to the type ii* theory changes the boundary condition in the time direction from dirichlet

to neumann, and so takes a dp-brane to an ep-brane. the e-branes preserve 16 of the

7

32 supersymmetries of the type ii* theories. smearing these solutions in the time direc-

tion gives the time-independent solutions given by (2.8) with h given by (2.4), and other

solutions can be obtained by smearing in spacelike directions.

3. brane solutions of arbitrary signature

for theories in spacetimes of signature (s, t ), we are interested in generalised brane

solutions with metric of the form

ds2 = h abdx adx b + h  ij dy idy j,

(3.1)

where ab is a at metric of signature (s, t) and ij is a at metric of signature (s, t) =
(s  s, t  t). we will require h to be a function of the transverse coordinates y i and
nd that the eld equations imply that h(y ) has to be a harmonic function, satisfying

ij ijh = 0,

(3.2)

and determine the constants , . the longitudinal space has signature (s, t), and we

refer to it as an (s, t)-brane, so that a conventional p-brane of a lorentzian theory with

(s, t ) = (d  1, 1) is a (p, 1)-brane. these solutions also have a non-vanishing n-form
gauge eld cn with n = s + t

cn = h dx 1  . . .  dx n

(3.3)

for some constant .

dierent types of solutions arise for dierent choices of harmonic function. a simple

choice is the wave-type solution

h = a sin(kiy i + c),

ijkikj = 0

(3.4)

with k a constant null vector. for the euclidean transverse space (as in p-branes) there

are no non-trivial null vectors k, but there are non-trivial solutions if the transverse space

8

has both spacelike and timelike dimensions. here we shall concentrate on solutions of the

form

or

h = c +

h = c +

q
 m

q
m

(3.5)

(3.6)

where m = s + t  s  t  2, q, q are real constants and ,  are the proper time and
distance dened by

2 =  2 = ijy iy j.

(3.7)

these solutions correspond to a source located at a point in the transverse space-time.

the two solutions (3.5),(3.6) are related by q = imq and so are distinct real solutions

only for odd m. there are also multi-centre generalisations with

h = c +xi

[ij(y i  y i

qi
i )(y j  y j

i )]m/2

(3.8)

corresponding to sources at the points y i

i in the transverse space.

the single-centre solutions have potential singularities on the light-cone 2 = 0,

where h diverges, and on the hyperboloid where h = 0. as in the case of the e-branes,
the regions 2  0 and 2  0 corresponding to the exterior and interior of the light-cone
dene two distinct solutions and in each case we take the sign of q or q so that h > 0

in the appropriate region. we will sometimes refer to the (s, t)-brane solution with metric
(3.1) with (3.5) or (3.6) and coordinates restricted to 2  0 as an (s, t, +) brane and that
for the region 2  0 as an (s, t,) brane. then for the (s, t,) solution with  2  0, we
take (3.5) with c  0, q > 0 while for the (s, t, +) solution with 2  0 we take (3.6) with
c  0, q > 0; for m even, this is of course equivalent to taking (3.5) with c  0, q < 0.
we will be particularly interested in the asymptotic form of the geometries near 2 = 0.

note that this asymptotic form can be dierent for the two solutions (s, t,) [6]. we will
focus on the cases in which this is a product of constant curvature spaces (generalising

9

the usual p-brane case in which it is a product of a sphere and an anti-de sitter space) in

which the brane solution interpolates between this asymptotic geometry and at space.

m-theory is the strong coupling limit of the type iia string [2] and is a theory in 10+1

dimensions whose low-energy eective eld theory is 11-dimensional supergravity [15] with

10. this solution has bosonic symmetry iso(5, 1)  so(5) and

we will now consider the analogues of the m2-brane and m5-brane that occur in the

m* theory. the m* theory [4] is the strong coupling limit of the iia* theory and is a

10

theory in 9+2 dimensions whose eld theory limit is a supergravity theory with bosonic

action [3]

(3.14)

note that the sign of the kinetic term of g4 is opposite to that of the action (3.9); as

was shown in [6], the sign of the kinetic term is intimately related with the world-volume

signatures that can occur. the m* theory with action (3.14) has brane solutions with

world-volume signatures (3,0) and (1,2) [6], while if the sign of the kinetic term of g4 had
been the opposite of that in (3.14) to give a lagrangian r g2
there would have been a membrane solution with 2+1 dimensional world-volume. the sign

4/48 + ... in 9+2 dimensions,

of the g4 kinetic term in actions (3.9) and (3.14) is determined by supersymmetry [4].

the (1,2)-brane of the m*-theory is given by

ds2 =h 2/3(dt2  dt2 + dx2) + h 1/3(dy2
cttx = h 1,

2 + . . . + dy2

9),

(3.15)

where h(y3, . . . , y10) is again a harmonic function in r8, which we can take to be (3.11).

the world-volume has signature (1,2), with two times. this solution has bosonic symmetry

iso(1, 2)  so(8). the transverse space is euclidean, so there is only one solution, the
(1,2,+) solution. near y = 0, the metric takes the form

ds2 =

u 2
r2 (dt2  dt2 + dx2) +

r2du 2
u 2 + 4r2d2
7,

(3.16)

which is the metric on aads4s7, where d2
aads4 is the de sitter-like space of signature 2+2 given by the coset so(3, 2)/so(2, 2)

n is the metric on the n-sphere of unit volume,

[6], u = q1/6y2/2 and r = q1/6/2 = rs 7 /2. the (1,2)-brane interpolates between the
at space r9,2 and aads4  s7.

the second membrane-type solution of the m* theory is the (3,0)-brane given by

ds2 =h

(3.17)

where h is a harmonic function on the transverse space. the world-volume is euclidean,

with signature (3,0), and has isometry group iso(3)  so(6, 2). there are two distinct
complete solutions, the (3, 0, +) brane given by (3.17) in the region 2 = y2  t2  t2  0
and the (3, 0, ) brane given by (3.17) in the region 2  0. near y = 0 with 2  0 the
metric approaches h 4  aads7 as y  0, while for 2  0 it approaches ds4  ads7.
hence the (3, 0, +)-brane solution interpolates between the at space r9,2 and h 4aads7
while the (3, 0, ) brane solution interpolates between the at space r9,2 and ds4  ads7
[6].

the m* theory has a (5,1)-brane solution (analogous to the m5-brane of m-theory)

there is a iia string theory in a spacetime with signature 5+5 whose strong coupling

the brane solutions of the iia-type and iib-type theories are summarised in tables 2

and 3 respectively. the type ii branes all arise from solutions of the various 11-dimensional

theories [6]. the generalised fundamental strings have two-dimensional world-sheets of

signature (s, 2  s) and couple to the ns-ns 2-form gauge eld b2, while the generalised
ns 5-branes couple to its dual b6. the branes coupling to the rr n-form gauge elds cn

or their duals cm are d-branes on which fundamental strings can end and the solutions

are of the form (3.1) with  =  = 1/2.

we have included the d8-brane family of branes with s + t = 9 that are obtained by

t-duality from the results of [6]. note that the iia

5,5 theory, dened as the spacelike

t-dual of the iib 

5,5 theory or the timelike t-dual of the iib5,5 theory [4], is related to
the iia5,5 theory by g  g , interchanging space and time, and so every (s, t) brane
of the iia5,5 theory corresponds to a (t, s) brane of the iia
5,5 theory. these branes are

needed in checking the t-duality relations of the various d-branes. for example, a timelike

t-duality takes the (3,3) brane of the iib5,5 theory to a (3,4) brane or a (3,2) brane of

the iia

5,5 theory.

with signature (s, t ).

4. branes, interpolations and de sitter spaces

the m2-brane can be viewed as a soliton interpolating between 11-dimensional
minkowski space and the solution ads4  s7, while the m5-brane interpolates between

14

11-dimensional minkowski space and the solution ads7  s4 [17]. there are two m-brane
solutions corresponding to each entry in table 1 whenever the transverse space has indef-
inite signature, one with 2  0 and one with 2  0, and the asymptotic form of the
geometry near 2 = 0 was found to be a coset-space solution of signature s + t for each

case [6]. in each case, the metric is given by (3.1) with the harmonic function given by

(3.6) with vanishing constant piece, c = 0. the coset spaces that arise are as follows:

for a given space n of signature (s, t ), we denote by n the space of signature
(s, t ) given by multiplying the metric by 1, so that whereas adsn is a space of
signature (n 1, 1), adsn is a space of signature (1, n 1). in the cases iib,c and iiia-d,
the same geometry arises as the asymptotic limit for two dierent brane solutions. we will

discuss some of the implications of this in section 9.

we will now extend this to the brane solutions of the iib theories with s + t = 4

that correspond to the d3-brane that are listed in the c4 column of table 3, and nd their

15

interpolating geometries. the (s, t) d-brane solutions are all of the form

ds2 = h 1/2abdx adx b + h 1/2 ij dy idy j,

(4.1)

where ab is a at metric of signature (s, t) and ij is a at metric of signature (ss, t t),
with h a function of the transverse coordinates y i. for the d3-brane family for which

s + t = 4, the dilaton is zero and the four-form antisymmetric tensor is given by c4 =
h 1, where  is the volume-form on the longitudinal part of the spacetime. we dene
j and let 2 = y2  t2 = ij y iy j and  2 = t2  y2 = ij y iy j. in
y2 = y2

i and t2 = t2

this case, we take the harmonic function to be

so that h  1 and

h = 1 +

4

h 1/2 = 

q
2 + ...

(4.2)

(4.3)

when 2 is small. when the transverse space has indenite signature, there are two distinct
solutions, one dened for 2  0 and one for 2  0. in each of the two cases, 2  0
and 2  0, we choose the sign so that h 1/2 is positive in (4.3). the (s, t)-brane solution
interpolates between at space and the asymptotic geometry as   0, given by (4.1) with
h = q2/4. we list these asymptotic geometries below.

5. world-volume actions

an (s, t)-brane is invariant under the poincare group iso(s, t) and the world-volume

action should be a superpoincare-invariant theory in (s, t) dimensions with 16 supersym-

mmetries. in some cases the poincare symmetry will be enhanced to the conformal group

so(s + 1, t + 1), in which case the world-volume theory is invariant under the correspond-

ing superconformal group with 32 supersymmetries.

if the (s, t)-brane is embedded in

(s, t ) dimensions, the world-volume action should also have an r-symmetry that contains

so(s, t), where

s = s  s,

t = t  t.

(5.1)

here and in the following sections, we will nd the eld theories in (s, t) dimensions with 16

supersymmetries that are the unique candidates for world-volume actions for the various

17

branes, and postpone until section 9 a discussion of the dierences between (s, t, +) branes

and (s, t,) branes.

the (s, t)-branes that couple to the ramond-ramond gauge elds in a string theory

in (s, t ) dimensions with s + t = 10 are generalised d-branes and the dynamics are

governed by fundamental strings ending on the brane. the low-energy eective action for

these strings is a world-volume super-yang-mills (sym) theory (with a born-infeld-type

action) in (s, t) dimensions.

in 10 dimensions, the only signatures (s, t ) that allow an

n = 1 superalgebra with 16 supersymmetries are those admitting majorana-weyl spinors,

and these are the signatures (9,1) and (5,5) (together with the reverse signature (1,9)).

the (9,1) sym theory can be dimensionally reduced on a euclidean p-torus t p to give

the usual maximal sym theory in (9  p, 1) dimensions with r-symmetry so(p) or on
a lorentzian torus t p,1 to give a euclidean sym theory in (9  p, 0) dimensions with
r-symmetry so(p, 1). similarly, the (5,5) sym theory can be reduced on a torus t p,q

with signature (p, q) (with p  5, q  5) to give a sym theory in signature (5  p, 5  q)
with so(p, q) r-symmetry.

one apparent problem is that there are many more types of generalised d-branes in

tables 2 and 3 than there are types of sym theories, and it is not clear whether all cases

can be covered by the available sym theories. for example, an (s, t) brane of the iib

theory in (7,3) dimensions has iso(s, t)  so(7  s, 3  t) symmetry, and a natural way
that this could arise would be from compactifying a yang-mills theory in (7,3) dimensions

on a torus t 7s,3t, but there is no supersymmetric yang-mills theory in (7,3) dimensions.

this means that the world-volume theory must either come from a yang-mills theory in

(7,3) dimensions without supersymmetry, or must arise in some other way. we will address

this issue in the next section, and show that in each case the world-volume theory is in

fact a sym theory in s + t dimensions with these symmetries, and explain how this comes

about.

the m-theories in (10,1), (9,2) and (6,5) dimensions have generalised membranes with

18

s + t = 3 whose world-volumes are theories with 8 scalars and 8 fermions with poincare

symmetry iso(s, t) which is enhanced to the conformal group so(s + 1, t + 1) and r-

symmetry so(s  s, t  t) at a conformal xed point. there are also generalised 5-brane
solutions with world-volume signatures (s, t)=(5,1), (3,3), (1,5) and these are described by

tensor multiplets in (s, t) dimensions with a 2-form gauge-eld with self-dual eld strength,

5 scalars and 4 fermions with an so(ss, t t) r-symmetry and so(s+1, t+1) conformal
symmetry. the generalised membranes will be discussed in section 7 and the generalised

5-branes in section 8.

in each case, each of these branes can be linked to standard branes of m-theory or

string theory by chains of dualities, and this implies that for n coincident branes there is

a u (n ) gauge symmetry.

6. world-volume theories for generalised d-branes

in this section, we will discuss the world-volume theories of the d-branes of the various

type ii string theories. these are the branes that couple to rr gauge elds and on which

the fundamental string (which has either lorentzian or euclidean world-sheet, depending

on the case) can end.

the usual type iia and iib theories in (9,1) dimensions have dp-branes with world-

volume signature (p, 1) (with p even for iia and odd for iib) and these have eective

world-volume theories which are sym theories in (p, 1) dimensions obtained by reducing

(9,1) dimensional sym on the euclidean torus t 9p. timelike tduality takes the type iia

and iib theories to the iib* and iia* theories in (9,1) dimensions respectively, and takes

a d-brane with lorentzian world-volume of signature (p, 1) to an e-brane with euclidean

signature (p, 0). the eective world-volume theory is euclidean sym in (p, 0) dimensions

obtained by reducing (9,1) dimensional sym on the lorentzian torus t 9p,1. t-dualities

take d-branes or e-branes in (9,1) dimensions to d-branes or e-branes in (9,1) dimensions.

19

similarly, the iia and iib, iia* and iib* theories in (5,5) dimensions have d-branes

with world-volume signature (s, t) and these have eective world-volume theories which

are sym theories in (s, t) dimensions obtained by reducing (5,5) dimensional sym on the

torus t 5s,5t. (the iia* theory in (5,5) dimensions is obtained from the iia theory by

the mirror transformation g  g interchanging space and time, and so is equivalent
to the iia theory [4].)

thus in each of these cases, the world-volume theory for an (s, t) d-brane in (s, t )

dimensions (which is (9,1) or (5,5)) is (s, t)-dimensional sym obtained by reducing from
(s, t ) sym on t s,t to give a theory with iso(s, t)  so(s, t) symmetry. for example,
the (2,1)-brane in (9,1) dimensions is a (2,1)-dimensional sym theory obtained by reduc-
ing from (9,1)-dimensional sym theory on t 7 to give a theory with iso(2, 1)  so(7)
symmetry, which is enhanced to an o(3, 2) o(8) symmetry at the conformal xed point.
as mentioned in the previous section, this pattern cannot carry over to the string

theories in (8,2), (7,3) or (6,4) dimensions. in each case, the brane is expected to have a
symmetry containing iso(s, t)  so(s, t), and this would be the symmetry obtained by
reducing a yang-mills theory in (s, t ) dimensions on t s,t. but there is no sym theory

for these values of (s, t ), so that if this picture is correct, there can be no conventional

supersymmetry.

however, there is another way of getting a sym theory with the right symmetry.

consider, for example, the (3, 1) brane of the iib7+3 theory, which should have iso(3, 1)
so(4, 2) symmetry, and which could be expected to be governed by a sym theory. if there

were a sym theory in (7,3) dimensions, this could arise by reducing on t 4,2, but there

is no such theory. however, reducing the sym theory in (5,5) dimensions on t 2,4 does

give a sym theory in (3,1) dimensions with the required iso(3, 1)  so(4, 2) symmetry.
however, this would give an sym action in (3,1) dimensions in which 2 scalars have

a kinetic term of the right sign, and 4 with the wrong sign, while the (3,1) brane

should have 4 scalars with a kinetic term of the right sign, which are the zero-modes for

20

translations in the transverse spatial dimensions, and 2 with the wrong sign, which are

the zero-modes for translations in the transverse temporal dimensions. however, the right

scalar action could be obtained by starting from (5,5) dimensional sym in which the whole

action is multiplied by 1, so that the gauge elds have kinetic terms of the wrong sign;
this is clearly consistent with supersymmety.

this works for all the d-branes of the type ii theories in (8,2), (7,3) or (6,4) dimensions.

in each case, there is a candidate world-volume sym theory in (s, t) dimensions with
iso(s, t)  so(s, t) symmetry which is obtained by reducing an sym theory in ( s, t )
dimensions on t t,s,, where

s = s + t,

t = t + s

(6.1)

for this to work, it is essential that ( s, t ) should be (9,1), (5,5) or (1,9), so that an sym

theory in ( s, t ) dimensions exists, and remarkably this is the case for each d-brane in these

theories, as is easily checked. the iib theories in (9,1) or (5,5) dimensions, which are the

strong-coupling duals of the iib* theories, are related to these theories by t-dualities (the

(9,1) iib theory is t-dual to the (10,0) and (8,2) iia theories while the (5,5) iib theory

is t-dual to the (6,4) iia theory), and so the same pattern should persist for these theories

also; indeed, ( s, t ) is (9,1), (5,5) or (1,9) for each of the d-branes of the iib theories,

as is required. in each of these cases, the sym action in ( s, t ) dimensions has a gauge

eld kinetic term of the wrong sign, with all other signs following from supersymmetry.

as another example, consider the (1,3)-brane solution of iib7+3. the sym theory in this

case arises from the reduction of a (1,9) sym theory with the wrong sign on t 0,6 to

give a 1 + 3-dimensional sym theory with iso(1, 3) o(6) symmetry. for completeness,
we note that the (3,1), (2,0), (4,2) and (5,3) solutions of iib7+3 arise from reductions of

wrong sign (5,5) sym, the (0,2), (6,0) and (7,1) solutions of iib7+3 arise from reductions

of wrong sign (9,1) sym, and the (1,3) and (0,2) solutions of iib7+3 arise from reductions

of wrong sign (1,9) sym.

thus we have found the following picture. for the theories in which the fundamental

21

string has a lorentzian world-sheet, i.e. the iia, iib, iia*, iib* theories in (9,1) or (5,5)

dimensions, the world-volume theory is (s, t ) dimensional sym compactied on t s,t to
give a theory with iso(s, t) so(s, t) symmetry, and the (s, t ) dimensional sym theory
has action

s = 

1

4 z d10xf 2 + ...

(6.2)

with the right sign.

for the theories in which the fundamental brane has 2 euclidean dimensions, i.e.

the iib theories in (9,1) or (5,5) dimensions, the iia theories in (10,0),(8,2) and (6,4)

dimensions, and the iib theory in (7,3) dimensions, an sym theory with the right sym-

metry is obtained by reducing the sym theory in ( s, t ) dimensions on t t,s,, where the

( s, t )-dimensional sym action has the wrong sign for the gauge eld kinetic term.

s =

1

4 z d10xf 2 + ...

(6.3)

for the d-branes in (10,0), (8,2), (7,3) or (6,4) dimensions, this is the unique sym theory
with iso(s, t)so(s, t) symmetry, and so supersymmetry implies this must be the correct
world-volume theory in these cases, and then t-duality implies that this construction must

also give the world-volume theory for the d-branes of the iib theories.

as a further example, a (4,0) brane in (9,1) dimensions should be governed by an sym

theory in (4,0) dimensions with iso(4)  so(5, 1) symmetry, and such an sym theory
can be obtained either by reducing (9,1) dimensional sym on t 5,1 or by reducing (5,5)

dimensional sym on t 1,4; the former gives the world-volume theory of the (4,0) brane of

the iib*9,1 theory, and the latter gives the world-volume theory of the (4,0) brane of the

iib

9,1 theory.

the d-brane world-volume theories are then always supersymmetric yang-mills the-

ories with 16 supersymmetries, and the identications of these theories above is consistent

with t-duality. the theories in which the fundamental string is lorentzian have sym the-
ories with lagrangians f 2 + ... while those in which the fundamental string is euclidean

22

have sym theories with lagrangians +f 2 + ....

6.1. superconformal symmetry

for those d-branes with s + t = 4 (including the usual d3-brane) the sym theory

is invariant under the conformal group so(s + 1, t + 1), containing the poincare group
iso(s, t). the bosonic symmetry is then so(s + 1, t + 1)  so(s, t) and, as the theory is
supersymmetric, there must be a superconformal group for which this is the bosonic part.

for the usual d3-brane, this is the group su (2, 2/2), for the e4-brane of the iib*9+1 theory,

this is su (2, 2/2) and for the other cases other real forms of the same group emerge. we

summarise the results below (recall that su (4)  so(6), su (2, 2)  so(4, 2), sl(4, r) 
so(3, 3)).

table 5 the symmetries of the d-branes with world-volume signature (s, t) with

s + t = 4 coupling to c4 in the various iib theories. the world-volume theories arise in

each case from super-yang-mills theory in 9+1, 5+5 or 1+9 dimensions compactied on a

torus t p,q.

the table also gives the massless sector of the world-volume theories. in each case,

it is given by the super-yang-mills theory in 9+1, 5+5 or 1+9 dimensions dimensionally

reduced on a torus t p,q. the sign of the kinetic term of the gauge eld is the wrong one

(+f 2) for the branes of the iib  theories and the iib7+3 theories. for example, the (4,0)-

brane of the iib 
5,5 has a world-volume theory given by the sym theory in 5+5 dimensions
compactied on t 1,5 to obtain a theory with manifest iso(4)  o(1, 5) symmetry which
is enhanced to o(5, 1)  o(1, 5) by the conformal invariance.

7. the m2-brane family

in this section we consider the world-volume theories of the m-branes with s + t = 3

in s + t = 11 dimensions for s = 10, 9 or 6. a vertical dimensional reduction in a space

dimension then gives the (s, t) d-brane of a iia theory in (s1, t ) dimensions while a time
reduction gives the (s, t) d-brane of a iia theory in (s  1, t ) dimensions. in either case,
we know from the previous section which sym theory with a vector and 7 scalars gives

the world-volume theory of the (s, t) d-brane, and dualising the vector to an eighth scalar

then gives the world-volume theory of the m-brane, generalising the relation between the

d2-brane and the m2-brane [19]. the sign of the kinetic term of the extra scalar then

follows from the analysis of section 8 of [6].

it has been argued [20] that the world-volume theory of the m2-brane has an infra-red

xed point at which the theory becomes superconformally invariant. we shall assume that

all the world-volume theories in the m2-brane family have a superconformal xed point.

this assumption is supported by the fact that the near-horizon limit of each of these branes

is superconformally invariant.

the results are as follows. the world-volume theory is a theory in (s, t) dimensions
(s + t = 3) with 8 scalars and 8 fermions and a bosonic symmetry iso(s, t)  so(s, t).
the r-symmetry is so(s, t) and there are s scalars with the right sign kinetic term, and t

with the wrong one. the theory is assumed to have a conformal xed point at which the

24

iso(s, t) symmetry is enhanced to the conformal group so(s + 1, t + 1), and the theory is
invariant under a superconformal group with bosonic subgroup so(s + 1, t + 1) so(s, t).
for the usual m2-brane, this is the supergroup osp(4/8) while for the other cases it is a

dierent real form of this group.

for example, the sym theory of the (2,1)-brane solution of (10,1) m theory arises

from the (9,1) sym theory by compactifying on t 7. the o(7) symmetry is enhanced to
o(8) by dualising the vector a to an eighth scalar x 8. the iso(2, 1) o(8) symmetry is
then enhanced to o(3, 2)o(8) at the conformal xed point. the sym theory of the (3,0)-
brane solution of the (9,2) m* theory arises from the (9,1) sym theory by compactifying

on t 6,1. the o(6, 1) r-symmetry is enlarged to o(6, 2) by dualising the vector a to
an eighth scalar x 8, which has a kinetic term of the wrong sign. the iso(3)  o(6, 2)
symmetry is then enhanced to o(4, 1)  o(6, 2) at the conformal point.

a similar analysis holds for the (2,1) solution of m* and for the (2,1) and (0,3) solutions

of the (6,5) m. we summarise the results below.

s + t = 3 coupling to c3 in the various m-theories with signature (s, t ).

8. the m5-brane family

in this section we consider the world-volume theories of the m-branes with s + t = 6

in s + t = 11 dimensions for s = 10, 9 or 6. a spatial double dimensional reduction of

an (s, t) m-brane gives an (s  1, t) d-brane in the iia theory in signature (s  1, t ) and

25

a timelike double dimensional reduction gives an (s, t  1) d-brane in the iia theory in
signature (s, t  1). in either case, the world-volume theory of the d-brane is the sym
theory in (s1, t) dimensions or (s, t1) dimensions determined in section 5, with bosonic
symmetry iso(s 1, t) so(s, t) or iso(s, t 1) so(s, t). the m-brane world-volume
theory is a self-dual tensor multiplet with 5 scalars and 4 spinor elds that gives the sym

theories on spacelike or timelike dimensional reduction. this tensor multiplet theory has
bosonic symmetry containing iso(s, t)  so(s, t), with the s + t = 5 scalars in a vector
representation of so(s, t), so that there are s scalars with a kinetic term of the right sign

and t with the wrong sign. this theory is in fact conformally invariant, so that the poincare

symmetry iso(s, t) is enhanced to the conformal group so(s + 1, t + 1), and the theory is
invariant under a superconformal group with bosonic subgroup so(s + 1, t + 1) so(s, t),
and in each case is some real form of osp(8/4).

for example, the m5-brane or (5,1)-brane of the (10,1) m theory arises as the strong

coupling limit of the d4-brane. the d4-brane world-volume theory is (4,1)-dimensional

sym with iso(4, 1)  o(5). at strong coupling an extra dimension emerges, so that
the poincare symmetry becomes iso(5, 1) and is a subgroup of the conformal symmetry

so(6, 2), so that the full bosonic symmetry is o(6, 2)  o(5). on the other hand, the
(5,1)-brane of the (9,2) m* theory is the strong-coupling limit of the e5-brane of the iia*

theory in 9+1 dimensions, and the e5-brane symmetry o(4, 1)  iso(5) is enhanced to
o(4, 1) iso(5, 1) in the strong coupling limit in which an extra time dimension emerges,
and conformal invariance then increases this to the o(4, 1)  o(6, 2) symmetry of a self-
dual tensor theory in 5+1 dimensions with o(4, 1) r-symmetry and twisted supersymmetry

with 16 supercharges. a similar analysis holds for the other m5-branes. we summarise

9. dualities between conformal field theories and de sitter space theories.

the massless sector of the d3-brane, m2-brane and m5-brane world-volume theories

are eld theories in 3+1, 2+1 and 5+1 dimensions which are superconformally invariant
and are dual to the iib string theory in ads5  s5, m-theory in ads4  s7 and m-theory
in ads7  s4, respectively [7]. the original argument leading to this holographic duality
was based on considering a certain limit of the brane theory. in [7], n parallel d3-branes
separated by distances of order  were considered and the zero-slope limit   0 was
taken keeping r = / xed, so that the energy of stretched strings remained nite. this

decoupled the bulk and string degrees of freedom leaving a theory on the brane which

is u (n ) n = 4 super yang-mills with higgs expectation values, which are of order r,
corresponding to the brane separations. the corresponding d3-brane supergravity solution
is of the form (2.3) and has charge q = a2  n gs/2 where gs is the string coupling
constant, which is related to the super yang-mills coupling constant gy m by gs = g2
y m .
then as   0, q becomes large and the background becomes ads5  s5. the iib string
theory in the ads5  s5 background is a good description if the curvature r  1/a2 is
not too large, while if a2 is large, the super yang-mills description is reliable. in the t

hooft limit in which n becomes large while g2

y m n is kept xed, gs  1/n , so that as
n  , we get the free string limit gs  0, while string loop corrections correspond to

27

1/n corrections in the super yang-mills theory. similar arguments apply to the m2 and

m5 brane cases.

this was extended to the case of e4-branes in [3], and the two e4-brane solutions,

the (4, 0, )-branes, correspond to whether the separation between the e4-branes that
is kept xed is spacelike or timelike. recall that the scalars of the super yang-mills

theory are in a vector representation of the so(5, 1) r-symmetry, where those in the 5 of

so(5)  so(5, 1) have kinetic terms of the right sign and correspond to brane separations
in the 5 spacelike transverse dimensions, while the remaining (u (n )-valued) scalar is a

ghost and corresponds to timelike separations of the e-branes. for the case of n parallel

e4-branes of the iib* string theory separated by distances of order  in one of the 5
spacelike transverse dimensions, we take the zero-slope limit   0 keeping  = /
xed. this gives a decoupled theory on the brane consisting of the u (n ) n = 4 euclidean
super yang-mills, with higgs expectation values of order  for the scalars corresponding

to the spacelike separations. the corresponding supergravity background is the (4, 0, +)-
brane. we again have q = a2  n gs/2 and gs = g2
y m , so that for large n , the system
can be described by the iib* string theory in ds5  h 5 if a2 is large and by the large
n euclidean super yang-mills theory when a2 is small. in the t hooft limit, string loop

corrections again correspond to 1/n corrections in the super yang-mills theory. for n

e4-branes of the iib* string theory separated by distances of order t in the timelike
transverse dimension, we take the zero-slope limit   0 keeping  = t / xed. this
gives a decoupled theory on the brane consisting of the u (n ) n = 4 euclidean super
yang-mills, with higgs expectation values of order  for the scalars corresponding to the

timelike separations. the corresponding supergravity background is the (4, 0, ) brane.
again for large n , the system can be described by the iib* string theory in ds5  h 5 if
a2 is large and by the large n euclidean super yang-mills theory when a2 is small.

similar arguments can be given for each of the brane solutions in the d3-brane, m2-

brane and m5-brane families with various signatures. considering n parallel (s, t) branes

28

and taking the maldacena limit, we formally obtain a duality between the (s, t) brane

world-volume superconformal eld theory and the iib or m-theory in (s, t ) dimensions

in the spacetime given by the asymptotic form of the (s, t) brane solution. moreover, it is

straightforward to check that the superconformal group found for the world-volume theories

matches the super-isometry group of the asymptotic geometry, so that the symmetries of

the two theories agree.

however, there are some new complications that arise for the cases considered here.

the metric (3.1),(3.5) corresponds to two solutions, the (s, t, +) brane and the (s, t,)
brane (unless the transverse space is euclidean), and each of these has a dierent asymp-

totic geometry in general. although for a given (s, t) there are two brane solutions, there

is only one (s, t) worldvolume eld theory allowed by supersymmetry. a given spacetime

can arise as the asymptotic geometry for several dierent types of brane. for example,

the m*-theory solution ads7  ds4 is the asymptotic geometry for both the (5,1,+) brane
and the (3, 0, ) brane of m*-theory. the asymptotic geometry is often the product of
two non-compact spaces, and so holography might be expected to operate in each factor,

with a eld theory associated with some surface (e.g. the boundary) for each. clearly, the

dualities between theories will be more complicated than in the cases considered in [7].

let us consider the example of the (0,3) brane of m theory in some detail. the

transverse space has signature (6,2) and the world-volume theory has 8 scalars transforming

as a vector under the o(6,2) r-symmetry and 8 fermions transforming as a spinor of

o(6,2). the iso(3) poincare symmetry is enhanced to o(1,4) conformal symmetry, and

the superconformal group is osp(4/8). in the usual way, for n branes the world-volume

elds take values in the lie algebra of u (n ) and giving some of the scalars expectation

values corresponds to separating the branes. two branes at two positions in r6,2 have a

separation which can be spacelike, timelike or null.

the two associated supergravity solutions, the (0,3,+) brane and the (0, 3, ) brane,
both have isometry iso(3)  o(6, 2). the asymptotic geometry for the (0,3,+) brane is

29

aads7  ds4 while that for the (0, 3, ) brane is ads7  h4, and both have isometry
group o(4, 1)  o(6, 2), contained in the super-isometry group osp(4/8).
if the two
solutions, the (0, 3, ) branes, are both associated with the same eld theory, then this
would suggest that m theory in ads7  h4 is dual to m theory in aads7  ds4.
moreover, precisely the same asymptotic geometries arise for the (5,1) brane  the (5,1,+)

brane tends to ads7  h4 and the (5, 1, ) to aads7  ds4. this would then lead to
the suggestion that the (5, 1, ) theory should be dual to the (0, 3, ) theory. then there
are four theories  the world-volume theories of the (5,1) and (0,3) branes, and m theory

in the backgrounds ads7h4 and aads7ds4  each with the same symmetry group,
osp(4/8), and naive application of standard arguments suggest they might all be related

by dualities.

to see what is going on, it will be useful to consider the application of the maldacena

argument to this case. consider a two-centre (0,3) brane solution with metric (3.1) and

q
0 )(y j  y j
[ij (y i  y i

0 )]3

(9.1)

harmonic function

h = c +

q

(ijy iy j)3 +

corresponding to a brane of charge q at y = 0 and one of charge q at y = y0. suppose

further that q >> q, corresponding to n branes at y = 0 and n branes at y = y0 with

n >> n. the contribution of the n branes will be small except in a neighbourhood of

y0, and outside this neigbourhood the solution is approximately that of n branes at the

origin, so that the n branes can be thought of as probes in the n brane background. if y0

is spacelike, we should take this n brane geometry to be the (0,3,+) solution while if it

is timelike, we should take the (0, 3, ) one, and more generally for a multi-centre (0,3,+)
solution the positions y0 in (3.8) should all be spacelike, while for the (0, 3, ) solution
they should be timelike. these correspond to the spacelike and timelike interpolations of

[3].

this suggests that the (0,3) world-volume theory has (at least) two branches, one

in which the scalar expectation values are all spacelike, and one in which they are all

30

timelike. then the (0,3,+) brane solutions should correspond to the branch of the world-

volume theory in which the expectation values of the scalars are all spacelike and the

(0, 3, ) brane solutions to the timelike branch. however, these two branches are clearly
part of the same connected moduli space of one theory, so that presumably one can move

continuously between them.

we now take the maldacena limit in which the planck length lp tends to zero while

the brane separation y0 scales so that y0/l3

p stays xed. for the case with y0 spacelike,
this gives the (0,3,+) asymptotic geometry, aads7ds4, while for the timelike case this
gives ads7  h4. then m theory in these two asymptotic geometries should each, by
the usual arguments, be holographically related to the corresponding branch of the (0,3)

world-volume theory, and so m theory in these two dierent backgrounds correspond to

dierent points in the same connected moduli space, and so in this sense are dual to each

other.

consider the space ads7  h4. the hyperbolic space h4 has a boundary s3
and the (0,3) brane world-volume theory is associated with this boundary, while ads7
has a timelike boundary s5  s1 (or s5  r for the covering space cads7, conformal to
minkowski space r5,1) and this boundary is associated with the (5,1) brane world-volume

theory.

for supersymmetric solutions of any of these theories of the form ads7  y4 with
y 4 compact (as in the solution of m-theory with y4 = s4), there is a holographic relation

between the theory in ads7y4 and a 5+1 dimensional cft on the boundary of the anti-de
sitter space. the relation is that of [21,22]; if the elds bulk i tend to prescribed functions

0(x) on the ads boundary, the partition function z(i

0) for the bulk theory is identied

with (a generating functional for) correlation functions of a conformal eld theory on the

boundary. similarly, for solutions x7  h4 with x7 compact, then the bulk partition
function with prescribed boundary values on the boundary s3 of h 4 is identied with

correlation functions of a euclidean cft on s3 (since h 4 is the analytic continuation of

31

ads4). now the same should apply if x or y is non-compact, provided trivial boundary
conditions are imposed on x or y . in particular, for ads7 h4, the m theory partition
function with prescribed boundary conditions on ads7 and trivial boundary conditions on

h4 should be identied with correlation functions of the (5, 1, +) brane world-volume
cft, while the m theory partition function with prescribed boundary conditions on h4
and trivial boundary conditions on ads7 should be identied with correlation functions

of the (0, 3, ) brane world-volume cft. when there are non-trivial boundary conditions
for both spaces, it seems unlikely that the system could be described by either the 3-

dimensional cft or the 6-dimensional cft on their own, but that perhaps both would

be needed.

this suggests the following picture for the general case. for a given (s, t), the (s, t,)

branes will tend to the asymptotic geometries

(s, t, +)  brane  x +

(s+1,t)  y +

(s1,t),

(s, t,)  brane  x 

(s,t+1)  y 

(s,t1)

(9.2)

for spaces x, y , listed in section 4, where x +

(s+1,t) has signature (s + 1, t) etc. in some

situations, as in m-theory or the iib string, one of the two cases will be absent. the (s, t)
brane world-volume cft will correspond to the bulk theory on x   y  with prescribed
boundary conditions on x  and trivial boundary conditions on y . the world-volume

theory of the (s, t) brane has two branches, the (s, t, +) branch with scalar expectation

values in a spacelike direction in the moduli space, and the (s, t,) branch with scalar
expectation values in a timelike direction. the (s, t, +) branch of the eld theory is dual

(s+1,t)  y +

(s1,t) and is associated with the boundary of x +

to the theory on x +
the (s, t,) branch of the eld theory is dual to the theory on x 
is associated with the boundary of x 

(s,t1) and
(s,t+1). further, assuming that it is valid to view
the (s, t,) branches as two regions in the modulli space of a single theory, namely the
(s, t)-brane world-volume theory, then this theory is holographically related to the string

(s,t+1)  y 

(s+1,t), while

or m-type theory on the two spaces x +

(s,t1). these two

(s+1,t)  y +

(s1,t) and x 

(s,t+1)  y 

32

solutions also have a holographic dual associated with the boundary of y , a conformal
eld theory in (s 1, t 1) dimensions associated with the boundaries of both y +
of y 

(s1,t) and
(s,t1), with the two branches of the eld theory corresponding to the two dierent
solutions. then there is a quartet of related theories, the string or m-type theory on the

(s+1,t)  y +

two spaces x +
(s,t1), and the conformal eld theories in
(s, t) dimensions and in (s 1, t 1) dimensions. the relation between these theories that
is suggested is intriguing and clearly deserves further investigation.
