abstract

light cone form of eld dynamics in anti-de sitter spacetime is described. we also present light
cone reformulation of the boundary conformal eld theory representations. ads/cft correspondence
between the bulk elds and the boundary operators is discussed.

motivation. a long term motivation to develop light cone formalism in ads spacetime comes from

a number of the following potentially important applications.

one important application is to type iib superstring in ads5  s5 background. inspired by the con-
jectured duality between the string theory and n = 4, 4d sym theory [1] the green-schwarz formulation
of strings propagating in ads5  s5 was suggested in [2] (for further developments see [3]-[5]). despite
considerable eorts these strings have not yet been quantized (some related interesting discussions are in
[6],[7]). alternative approaches can be found in [8]. as is well known, quantization of gs superstrings
propagating in at space is straightforward only in the light cone gauge. the light cone gauge in string
theory implies the corresponding light cone formulation for target space elds. in the case of strings in
ads background this suggests that we should rst study a light cone form dynamics of target space elds
propagating in ads spacetime. understanding a light cone description of ads target space elds might
help to solve problems of strings in ads spacetime.

the second application is to a theory of higher massless spin elds propagating in ads spacetime.
some time ago completely self-consistent interacting equations of motion for higher massless elds of all
spins in four-dimensional ads spacetime have been discovered [9]. for generalization to higher spacetime
dimensions see [10]. despite eorts the action that leads to these equations of motion has not yet
been obtained. in order to quantize these theories and investigate their ultraviolet behavior it would
be important nd an appropriate action. since the higher massless spin theories correspond quantum
mechanically to non-local point particles in a space of certain auxiliary variables, it is conjectured that
they may be ultraviolet nite (see [11],[12]). we believe that a light cone formulation is what is required
to understand these theories better. the situation here may be analogous to that in string theory;
a covariant formulation of closed string eld theories is non-polynomial and is not useful for practical
calculations, while the light cone formulation restricts the string action to cubic order in string elds.

light cone formulation of eld dynamics in ads spacetime. first let us discuss the forms of
ads algebra, that is so(d1, 2), we are going to use. ads algebra of d dimensional ads spacetime consists
of translation generators p a and rotation generators j ab which span so(d  1, 1) lorentz algebra. the
commutation relations of ads algebra in antihermitean basis are

[ p a, p b] = 2 j ab ,

[ p a, j bc ] = ab p c  ac p b ,

[ j ab, j ce] = bc j ae + 3 terms ,

this form algebra is not convenient for our purposes. we prefer to use the form provided by nomenclature
of conformal algebra. namely we introduce new basis which consists of new translations p a, conformal
boosts k a, dilatation d, and so(d  2, 1) algebra generators j ab dened by

in the conformal algebra basis one has the following well known commutation relations

[d, k a] = k a ,

[p a, p b] = 0 ,

[k a, k b] = 0 ,

[p a, j bc] = abp c  acp b ,

where a, b, c, e = 0, 1, . . . , d  3, d  1. in this form the ads algebra is known as the algebra of conformal
transformations in (d  1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime. below we shall be interested in realiza-
tion of this algebra as the one of transformations of massless bulk elds propagating in d-dimensional
ads spacetime as well as in realization of this algebra as the algebra of conformal transformations on
appropriate cft operators in (d  1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime.

to develop light cone formulation we shall use poincare parametrization of ads spacetime in which

ds2 =

1
z2 (dt2 + dx2

i + dz2 + dx2

d1) ,

z > 0 .

here and below we set cosmological constant  equal to unity. the boundary at spatial innity corre-
sponds to z = 0.2 the killing vectors in these coordinates are given by3

p a, = a ,

k a, =

x2
 a + xax ,

d, = x ,

j ab, = xab  xba ,

(5)

while the corresponding generators are dened as g = g,. then we introduce light cone variables
x, xi = (xi, xz)

(xd1  x0) ,

x 
in this notation scalar product of tangent space vectors is decomposed as

i, j, k, l = 1, . . . , d  2 ,

x0  t, xd2  z ,

i, j, k, l = 1, . . . , d  3 .

x ay a = x +y  + x y + + x i y i ,

x i y i = x iy i + x zy z ,

i.e. we use the convention x d2 = x z. the coordinate x+ is considered as an evolution parameter. here
and below to simplify our expressions we will drop the metric tensors ab, ab in scalar products.

in light cone basis the ads algebra splits into generators

which we refer to as kinematical generators and

p +, p i, j +i, k +, k i, d, j +, j ij ,

p , j i , k  ,

(6)

(7)

which we refer to as dynamical generators. for x+ = 0 the kinematical generators are realised quadrat-
ically in physical elds while the dynamical generators receive corrections in interaction theory. in this
paper we deal with free elds. the light cone form of ads algebra can be obtained from (2)-(4) with the
light cone metric having the following non vanishing elements + = + = 1, ij = ij .

now our primary goal is to nd realization of this algebra on the physical elds. for deniteness we
will be interested in spin s totally symmetric elds. to keep formulas as simple as possible, let us start
with spin one maxwell eld. instead of target space eld a with the equations of motion df  = 0
we introduce tangent space eld a dened by

2 poincare coordinates cover half of ads spacetime. because we are interested in innitesimal transformation laws of

physical elds the global description of ads spacetime is not important for our study.

and use equations of motion in tangent space dbf ba = 0, fab = dab  dba, where f ab is the
eld strength in the tangent space while da is covariant derivative which in poincare coordinates take
the form

dab = ab + z

from these relations one gets the following second order equations of motion for the gauge eld a

(9)

where 2  2
mation a = a we can impose the light cone gauge

a and   aa. since these equations are invariant with respect to the gauge transfor-

+ = 0 .

inserting this into equations (9) we get the following constraint4

from (11) we express the  in terms of the physical eld5

(10)

(11)

(12)

note that the second term in r.h.s. of equation (12) is absent in at space. it is this term that breaks
so(d 2) manifest invariance and reduce it to so(d 3) one. by virtue of the constraint (11) the equations
of motion (9) take the form

from this we get the following equations for the physical elds i, z:

( 2 + (1  d) z + d  2)a + (d  4)a

z z = 0 .

( 2 + (1  d) z + d  2)i = 0 ,

( 2 + (1  d) z + 2d  6)z = 0 .

since this form of equations of motion is not convenient we introduce new physical eld i dened by6

i = z(d2)/2i .

in terms of i the equations of motion take the form

(2

4z2 (d  2)(d  4))i = 0 ,

(2

4z2 (d  4)(d  6))z = 0 .

dividing by + these equations can be rewritten in the schrodinger form

where the action of p  on physical elds is dened by

few comments are in order. i) from equations of motion (14) we see that in d = 4 the mass like terms
cancel. this fact reects the conformal invariance of spin one eld in four dimensional ads spacetime;
ii) in the equations above the eld i and z have dierent mass term. this is reection of breaking the

4recall that in the minkowski spacetime the maxwell equations in gauge + = 0 lead to the lorentz constraint aa =
0. this is not the case in ads spacetime. here, by virtue of the relation daa =  + (1  d)z , the constraint (11) does
not coincide with the lorentz constraint daa = 0.

5we assume, as usual in light cone formalism, that the operator + has trivial kernel.
6note that it is the eld i that has conventional canonical dimension 0 = (d  2)/2.

usual at space transverse so(d  2) algebra. on the other hand we see that ads light cone equations of
motion keep manifest so(d  3) symmetry. thus light cone formalism in ads spacetime breaks manifest
so(d  2) symmetry and keeps manifest so(d  3) one.
before continuing with our main theme let us note that gauge invariant action for spin one maxwell
eld s =  1

ab takes the following simple form in terms of physical eld i

4 r ddxgf 2

sl.c. = z ddx+i ( + p )i .

(17)

now let us turn to our primary aim that is transformation of physical degrees of freedom i . toward
this aim we start, as usual, with original global ads symmetries, supplemented with compensating gauge
transformations required to maintain the gauge

tota =  a  a +  .

as usual the gauge transformation parameter  can be found from the requirement tot+ = 0. from
these relations transformation of physical eld i is xed uniquely. the expressions can be simplied
if we use creation and annihilation operators i , i , [i , j ] = ij , and introduce fock vector for the
physical eld |i  i i|0i. the transformation laws of the physical eld can be then cast into the
following form

(19)

generalization to the case of arbitrary spin s totally symmetric eld is relatively straightforward (see
[15]). in this case the physical degrees of freedom are described by traceless totally symmetric tensor
eld i1...is. to simplify expressions it is useful as above to collect physical degrees of freedom in one
fock vector

with this notation the equations of motion and corresponding hamiltonian p  take the form

the transformations of physical elds under the action of global ads symmetries take the same form as
in (18) where we have to use schrodinger equation of motion (15) and p  given in (20).7 making use
of the ads transformations (18) we can represent them as dierential operators acting on the physical
massless eld |i. plugging the killing vectors (5) in transformation laws (18) we get corresponding
dierential form of generators. light cone form of ads algebra kinematical generators is given by

7note that light cone action for arbitrary spin s eld takes the following elegant and extremely simple form

sl.c. = r ddxh+|( + p )|i where p  is given by (20). in d = 4 because of m11 = 0 the mass like term in (20)

cancels. this fact reects conformal invariance of arbitrary spin s totally symmetric massless eld in ads4 spacetime.

light cone form of conformal eld theory. now the so(d 1, 2) algebra is considered as algebra
of conformal transformations of (d  1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime and we are interested in light
cone reformulation of (free) conformal eld theory. the reason for doing this is that we are going to
establish ads/cft correspondence between bulk massless elds and conformal eld theory operators.
as the bulk massless elds have been studied within the framework of the light cone formalism the most
adequate form for comparison is the light cone form of conformal eld theory. to keep our presentation
as simple as possible we restrict our attention to the case of arbitrary spin totally symmetric operators
oa1...as(x) that have canonical conformal dimension  = s + d  3.8 these operators, by denition, are
traceless oaaa3...as = 0 and divergence free xaoaa2...as = 0. as above to simplify our presentation we
consider fock space vector (generating function) |ocovi  oa1...asa1 . . . as|0i. in terms of generating
function the traceless and divergence free conditions take the following form

a a|ocovi = 0 ,

axa|ocovi = 0 .

realization of conformal algebra generators on the space of operators |ocovi is given by [14]

p a = a ,

k a =

b a + xa(xbxb + ) + m abxb ,
x2

j ab = xab  xba + m ab ,

d = xaxa +  ,

m ab = a b  b a ,

(27)

(28)

(29)

where a  abxb and m ab is the so(d 2, 1) algebra spin operator. because in the bulk the so(d 1, 2)
algebra was realized on the space of unconstrained physical elds it is reasonable to solve the second
constraint in (27) and formulate boundary conformal theory also in terms of unconstrained operators
which we shall denote by |oi. one can choose a basis which makes j +i, j + and k +independent of
m ab. the nal light cone form of the generators realized on conformal theory operators is (see [15])

p a = a ,
j +i = x+i  xi+ ,
k + =

where the spin operator m ij is the same as in (29). the operator m i transforms in vector representation
of the spin operator m ij and satises the commutation relations9

[m i, m jk] = ijm k  ikm j ,

[m i, m i] = 2m ij ,

where 2 is the dalamber operator in (d 1) dimensional minkowski spacetime 2  2

ads/cft correspondence. after we have derived the light cone formulation for both the bulk
eld |i and the boundary conformal theory operator |oi we are ready to demonstrate explicitly the
ads/cft correspondence. we demonstrate that boundary values of normalizable solutions of bulk
equations of motion are related to conformal operators |oi (see [16],[15]).

8the fact that this expression is nothing but the lowest energy value of spin s massless elds propagating in d dimensional

ads spacetime has been demonstrated in [13].

9detailed description of operator m i which should not be confused with m i given in (24) may be found in [15].

to this end we decompose eld |i into irreducible representations of so(d  3) subalgebra |i =
ps
s=0 |si, (i i  s)|si = 2
i |si = 0, and rewrite equations of motion (20) in the form

where we have used the relation

|s (x, z)i = qzj(qz)q(+ 1

2 )|os (x)i

(35)

where an operator |oi10 does not depend on z and the j is bessel function. in (35) we use the notation
|oi since we are going to demonstrate that this is indeed the cft operator discussed above. namely, we
are going to prove that ads transformations for |i lead to conformal theory transformations for |oi

(36)

gads|si = z(qz)q(+ 1

2 )gcf t|osi ,

z(z)  zj(z) .

here and below we use the notation gads and gcf t to indicate the realization of so(d  1, 2) algebra
generators on the bulk eld (21)-(26) and conformal operator (30)-(33) respectively.
toward this purpose let us make a comparison for generators for bulk eld |i and boundary operator
|oi. important technical simplication is that it is sucient to make comparison only for the part of the
algebra spanned by generators p a, j ab, d, k +. it is straightforward to see that if these generators match
then the remaining generators k  and k i shall match due to commutation relations of the so(d  1, 2)
algebra. we start with a comparison of the kinematical generators (6). as for the generators p +, p i,
j +i, j ij , they already coincide on both sides (see (21),(22) and (30),(31)). in fact this implies that the
coordinates p+, pi, we use on ads and cft sides match.

now let us consider p 

ads (20) and p 

motion (20), by denition, satisfy the relation p 
desired relation (36). so p 
that the generators j +
consider the kinematical generators k +

ads , dads (22),(21) and j +

ads and p 

ads (23) and k +

cf t (30). taking into account that the solutions to equations of
cf t satisfy the
cf t also match. taking this into account it is straightforward to see
cf t , dcf t (31), (30) also satisfy the relation (36). next we

ads|i = |i we get that p 

ads and p 

cf t (32). making use of the following relation

2 )z(qz) = q(+ 1

2 )z(qz)(k +

2 ) +
q

(qz(qz))zz ,

the relation (35) and the fact that |oi in (35) does not depend z we get immediately that k +
k +
cf t satisfy the relation (36). the last step is to match the generators j i
p 
ads = p 
that all that remains to do is to match m i
of matching which can be proved by direct calculation (see [15]).

ads and
cf t. using the relation
cf t given in (25) and (32) we conclude
cf t. technically, this is the most dicult point

cf t and comparing the above expression for j i
ads (24) and m i

ads with j i

ads and j i

finally let us write ads/cf t correspondence for bulk symmetric spin s elds and corresponding

boundary conformal theory operators. from (35) we can read, up to a factor, the following relation

lim
z0

z +0|s (x, z)i = |os (x)i

where in this expression  is the spin part of dilatation generator given in (33) while 0 is a canonical
dimension of bulk massless eld in adsd spacetime 0 = (d  2)/2. above analysis is straightforwardly
generalized to the case of non-normalizable solutions and shadow operators (see [15]).
conclusions we have developed the light cone formalism in ads spacetime. here we discussed
application of this formalism to the study of ads/cft correspondence but it is applicable for discussion

10note that we decompose the operator |oi into irreducible representations of so(d  3) algebra |oi = ps

where |os i satisfy the relations (i i  s)|os i = 2

i |os i = 0.

of various interesting problems some of which are: (i) generalization to supersymmetry and applications
to supergravity in ads background and then to strings in this background; (ii) extension of light cone
formulation of conformal eld theory to the level of opes and study of light cone form of ads/cft
correspondence at the level of correlation functions; (iii) application of light cone formalism to the study
of the s-matrix along the lines of [17][21]; (iv) applications to interaction vertices for higher massless
spin elds in ads spacetime. because the formalism we presented is algebraic in nature it allows us to
treat elds with arbitrary spin on equal footing. comparison of this formalism with other approaches
available in the literature leads us to the conclusion that this is a very ecient formalism. application
of the formalism above to study of iib supergravity in ads5  s5 background may be found in [22].
