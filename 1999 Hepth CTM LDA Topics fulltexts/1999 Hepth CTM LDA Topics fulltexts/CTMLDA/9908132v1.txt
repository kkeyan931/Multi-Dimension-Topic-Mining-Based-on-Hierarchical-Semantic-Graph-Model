new solution to the sixdimensional vacuum einsteins equations is constructed as a non-linear
superposition of two ve-dimensional solutions representing the melvingibbonsmaeda universe
and its s-dual. then using duality between d = 8 vacuum and a certain class of d = 11 super-
gravity congurations we generate m 2 and m 5 uxbranes as well as some of their intersections
also including waves and kk-monopoles.

i. introduction

as it is well-known [1] when gravity is taken into
account, an uniform electromagnetic eld gives rise to
spacetimes of two dierent types. one is the bertotti-
robinson solution which is the product ads2  s2 and
thus is so(3) symmetric, the eld is radially directed.
the second is the melvin universe [2], which is the static
cylindrically symmetric solution to the four-dimensional
einstein-maxwell theory, the eld being directed along
the axis of symmetry.
in the context of the four-
dimensional n = 2 supergravity the rst solution is fully
supersymmetric, while the second is not.
it is, how-
ever, of interest in view of the possibility to study non-
perturbative processes of pair creation of charged black
holes in strong electromagnetic eld [3]. similar situ-
ation holds in d = 11 supergravity where instead of
the two-form eld one encounters a four-form. corre-
spondingly, there exists a fully supersymmetric solution
ads4  s7, analogous to the bertotti-robinson solution
of the four-dimensional einstein-maxwell theory, while
the melvin type gives rise to so-called uxbranes, term
suggested in [4]. simplest explicit uxbrane solution for
higher rank antisymmetric form was obtained in [5] using
some generating symmetry. here we construct more gen-
eral uxbrane solutions to d = 11 supergravity including
intersecting ones employing another technique.

where a = 2/b, b being the magnetic eld strength.
magnetic eld is conned within the tube of radius a, so
that the total ux is equal to b1. the transversal space
has an innite volume, but the circles of constant  have
the circumferences going to zero at innity. the same
metric describes an electric melvin solution in view of
the continuous electric-magnetic duality of the einstein-
maxwell system.

if one wishes to consider the maxwell eld as originat-
ing from the fth dimension via kaluza-klein reduction,
one has to use the following parameterization of the ve-
dimensional line element

which also contains a dilaton in four dimensions, as it is
clear from the reduction of the vedimensional einstein

the generalization of the melvin solution (1) to

the original melvin solution [2] representing the grav-

alternatively, this eld conguration represents the solu-
tion of the ve-dimensional vacuum einsteins equations
as follows

in presence of two killing vectors t, 5 the action (3)
exhibits a discrete s-duality under interchange of electric
and magnetic sectors with the simultaneous change of
sign of the dilaton. that way one obtains the following

this solution will be used to generate new classes of 11d
supergravity congurations via the following non-locally

iii. d = 8 vacuum  d = 11 supergravity

correspondence

one can show [7] that there exist a duality between
8d vacuum congurations possessing two commuting
spacelike killing vectors and d = 11 supergravity solu-
tions satisfying a certain ansatz. the eight-dimensional
metric possessing two commuting killing vectors in suit-
able coordinates reads

the above duality goes as follows. one has to build the
matrix hab and construct two-forms from kk-potentials

hab = e

[2] + f 

[2] (cid:17) , (14)

it has to be noted that the mapping from 8d to 11d
is a one to many, i.e. an 8d vacuum solution can have
several distinct 11d supergravity counterparts depend-
ing on the choice and the order of two killing vectors in
eight dimensions.

to use the above procedure for the solution (8) one
has to add two extra coordinates x1, x2 so that ds2
8 =
ds2
2 and then to choose the pair of killing
vectors with respect to which the parameterization of
the eight-dimensional metric has been done. let us start
with deriving single m 2 and m 5uxbranes by uplifting
either (4) or (7) 5d solutions translated to 8d form by
adding three at space coordinates. uplifting of (4) with
respect to the ordered pair of the killing vectors (z, x)
(x can be any one of the added three at coordinates)
one obtains the m 2uxbrane

where the 2  2 real matrix hab and the one-forms aa

(10)

where the functions g2, g3 and the six-dimensional metric
g depend only on transverse spacetime coordinates x,

alternatively, one can get the same solution by uplift-
ing (7) with respect to the killing pair (x, y), this is a
more complicated way. note that contrary to the canon-
ical charged m 2brane, the m 2uxbrane corresponds
not to electric, but to the magnetic sector of the form
eld.

similarly, the m 5uxbrane can be derived by uplift-
ing (7) using the following ordered pair of killing vectors
(y, x) (simpler way) or uplifting (4) via (x, z):

this solution is supported by the electric sector of the
four-form, contrary to the standard solitonic ve-brane.
both solutions does not possess residual supersymmetry.

v. intersecting m fluxbranes

now let us derive the 11d counterparts to the six-
dimensional solution (8) translated in two at directions,
x1, x2, making dierent choice of the ordered pairs from
three killing vectors y, z and x (x could be x1 or x2).
they form a class 11d supergravity solutions of the inter-
secting uxbrane type. dierent choice of killing vectors
leads to the following intersection:

first let us consider the case of the pair of killing vec-
tors (z, y) in some detail. following (12), the transition
to eleven dimension goes through the quantities

(17)

from which the functions g2 and g3 can be obtained by
solving (13):

we present below. the pair (y, z) generates intersect-
ing of two m 5uxbranes:

the solution obtained is the intersection of two m 2

vi. discussion

thus in eleven-dimensional supergravity there exist a
variety of uxbrane solutions originating from m 2 and
m 5 uxbranes. contrary to odinary charged branes, the
m 2 uxbrane is magnetic, while the m 5 one  electric.
their intersections obey the same intersection rules as
those for ordinary p-branes. our class does not include
intersections of m 2 and m 5 uxbranes between them-
selves, but these are likely to exist too as well as inter-
sections of more than two branes. all these solutions are
non supersymmetric. using similar method one can con-
struct more general solutions including combinations of
uxbranes and ordinary charges branes and investigate
the creation of the latters in the eld of external four-
forms.
