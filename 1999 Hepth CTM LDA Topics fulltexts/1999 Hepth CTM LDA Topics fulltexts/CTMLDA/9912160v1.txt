we calculate the linearized metric perturbation corresponding to a massless four-dimensional scalar
eld, the radion, in a ve-dimensional two-brane model of randall and sundrum. in this way we
obtain relative strengths of the radion couplings to matter residing on each of the branes. the
results are in agreement with the analysis of garriga and tanaka of gravitational and bransdicke
forces between matter on the branes. we also introduce a model with innite fth dimension and
almost conned graviton, and calculate the radion properties in that model.

recently, considerable interest has been raised by a
ve-dimensional model with an s1/z2 orbifold extra di-
mension with two 3-branes residing at its boundaries.1
this model and its non-compact analogues25 (see ref.6
for an account of earlier works) provide a novel set-
ting for discussing various conceptual and phenomeno-
logical issues related to compactication of extra dimen-
sions in models motivated by m-theory. in the two-brane
randallsundrum model,1 the branes have tensions +
and , and the bulk cosmological constant is chosen
in such a way that the classical solution describes ve-
dimensional space-time whose four-dimensional slices are
at,

ds2 = a2(z) dxdx  dz2

(1)

here a(z) = ek|z|, the fth coordinate z runs from z+ =
0 to z = rc and k = (4/3)g5 where g5 is newtons
constant in ve dimensions. the orbifold symmetry, a
local reection symmetry at each brane, is assumed to
hold for all elds in this space-time.

the excitations above the background metric (1) con-
tain a massless four-dimensional graviton (whose wave
function is peaked at the positive tension brane) and
the corresponding kaluzaklein tower.3 this is not the
whole story, however. in general when one has a wall in
spacetime, one might expect a translational zero mode
giving rise to free motion of the wall. in the case of anti-
de sitter spacetime, z is not a translational killing vec-
tor but a conformal killing vector, nonetheless we can
identify solutions to the perturbation equations which
correspond to proper motion of the wall (although these
will be singular on the ads horizon).
in the conven-
tional application of the israel equations, one identies
the extrinsic curvature, k , on each side of the wall,
and then applies a z2 symmetry across the wall leading
to k = (k +
)/2 = 0; geometrically this means
that the wall is locally at i.e. totally geodesic. to de-
scribe proper dynamical motion of the wall, we require
a nonzero k, which is possible if the z2-symmetry is
not imposed. the appropriate solution for such a motion
then turns out to be

 + k 

g =

sinh 2kz

2k

k

(2)

where k 
 = 0, which is recognised as the nambu equa-
tion for a brane. since this solution blows up at large
z, it does not correspond to a small perturbation of the
spacetime, and is indicative that in the presence of such
free motion, the asymptotic structure of the spacetime
is altered, similar to the dierence between the metrics
of a straight cosmic string and a crinkly cosmic string.7
as such, this perturbation is not considered in the gen-
eral spectrum of localised perturbations of the randall
sundrum wall.

once we have two branes however, the situation is dif-
ferent: there are now two sorts of motion, a centre of
mass (which will still be divergent) and relative motion 
the radion, for which the second wall acts as a regulator
on the divergence of (2). it is this second mode which
we wish to identify, which will correspond to a massless
four-dimensional scalar. one may or may not suspect
that the radion is also accompanied by its own kaluza
klein tower.

naively, the radion eld t (x) has been introduced by

considering metrics of the form1, 3, 8, 9

ds2 = e2k|z|t (x)g(x)dxdx  t 2(x)dz2

(3)

where g is the four-dimensional graviton. however,
the ansatz (3) does not solve even the linearized eld
equations that are obtained by setting t (x) = 1 + f (x),
g =  +  (x) with small f and . furthermore,
the ansatz (3) would imply that the radion does not in-
teract with matter living on the positive tension brane.
the latter feature, unnatural by itself, would be in con-
tradiction with the results of garriga and tanaka,10 who
calculated the long-range forces between matter placed
on the branes and showed, in particular, that matter
on each of the branes participates in interactions of the
bransdicke type.

the purpose of this note is to clarify this issue by cal-
culating, in linearized theory, the ve-dimensional met-
ric perturbation corresponding to the propagating radion

1

eld. we will see that this perturbation does not vanish
on either of the branes. we will point out also that there
is no kaluzaklein tower above the radion, i.e., that all
massive states have been accounted for in the analysis of
ref.3

to deal with the z2-symmetry as well as with junc-
tion conditions on the branes, it is convenient to choose
gaussian normal (gn) coordinates

gzz = 1 , gz = 0

(4)

such a system can always be chosen in the neighbor-
hood of the brane by integrating out along its normal, in
which case z will be the proper distance from the brane.
however, note that this system is slightly more general,
in that we can make coordinate transformations which
shift the wall, but preserve the metric components (4).
then the linearized theory is described by the metric

ds2 = a2(z)dxdx + h(x, z)dxdx  dz2

(5)

we will explicitly consider the region rc > z > 0; the
orbifold symmetry giving h for other values of z. the
four-dimensional indices will be raised and lowered us-
ing the minkowski metric  . the linearized einstein
equations are

the israel junction conditions on a brane are most eas-
ily formulated in the gn frame, in which the brane is lo-
cated at xed z. in the absence of matter on the brane,
these junction conditions are h
 + 2kh = 0. they
are not invariant under the gauge transformations (8) if
z 6= 0. the importance of the gauge transformations (8)
becomes clear from the observation that the coordinate
system which is gn with respect to one brane need not
be gn with respect to the other. hence, one is led to con-
sider two coordinate patches, the rst (second) of which
includes the positive (negative) tension brane. the co-
ordinate systems in each of these patches are gn to the
respective brane. a residual coordinate transformation is
needed then to relate the metrics in the overlap of these
patches.

in other words, to describe the propagating degrees of
freedom, we introduce two sets of elds, h(+)
 (x, z) and
 (x, z). the rst of them, h(+)
h()
 , is dened in the in-
terval in the fth direction that includes z+ = 0 but
excludes z = rc, and conversely for h()
 . both h()

obey source-free equations (7). the boundary conditions
are

h()
 + 2kh()

 = 0 at z = z

(9)

the relation between the two elds in the bulk is the
gauge transformation of the form (8) with yet unknown
gauge functions.

for tab = 0, the linearized einstein equations (7) with
boundary conditions (9) are straightforward to solve by
brute force. the outcome can be understood as follows.
in each of the patches we write

here tab is the energy-momentum tensor of additional
matter, if present, and

while the junction conditions on the respective branes
read

(12)

the latter are consistent with tt-property of h i
(4)f () = 0. hence, if the four-dimensional momenta
are such that p2 6= 0, one is left with eq.(11) and homoge-
neous boundary conditions (i.e., eq.(12) with f () = 0).
this is precisely the system of equations analyzed in
ref.,3 so we see that all massive propagating modes have
been revealed by that analysis.

at p2 = 0, however, there are two types of solutions.
one of them is f ()(x) = 0, h(x, z) = a2 (x), and

does not require the gauge transformation in the over-
lap of the two patches. these solutions have been con-
sidered in ref.,3 and describe massless four-dimensional
gravitons. the other type of solution is

h()
 = 

a2

2ka2 f ()

,

(13)

where f ()(x) are yet arbitrary and a = a(z). the
relation between f (+) and f () is found using (8). since
h are proportional to a2, they should coincide in the
two patches, so one requires a+f (+)(x) = af ()(x) 
f (x). one obtains nally

(14b)

where f (x) is a massless four-dimensional scalar mode.
the rst term on the rhs is clearly identiable as the
growing part of the mode in eq. (2), and hence corre-
sponds to motion of the wall; the coincidence of this
term in (14a) and (14b) identies this as a relative mo-
tion. one can quantify this by noting that the transition
function between the two patches is

z(x) = (cid:0)e2krc  1(cid:1) f (x) ,  = 0

(15)

this transition function then determines the physical dis-
tance between the branes, r(x)  rc = z(x) (recall that
eq. (8) is the coordinate transformation between the co-
ordinate systems in which the branes are located exactly
at z = 0 and z = rc, respectively). these properties
show that f (x) is indeed the (unnormalized) radion eld
in the linearized theory.

equations (14a) and (14b) determine the induced met-
rics on each of the branes in the presence of the radion
eld. the rst two terms on the right hand sides of these
equations can be gauged away on the branes. with the
graviton eld  included, the induced metrics on each
brane are

h()
 (x) = a2

(cid:18) +  (x) 

2k
a2


f (x)(cid:19)

(16)

if matter is present on the branes, it couples to the
induced metrics through lint  ht . clearly, the
radion eld couples to the trace of energy-momentum
tensor. the corresponding eective coupling constants
at each brane are proportional to g  a1
indeed,
 .
the elementary vertex of a graviton to matter at each
brane is proportional to pgn  where gn   a2
 are
eective four-dimensional newtons constants at each
brane;1 from eq.(16) it follows that the radion vertex
contains an extra factor a2
 . hence, the radion eld
couples to matter on the negative tension brane expo-
nentially stronger than to matter on the positive tension
one, g2
+ = e2krc . this relation is just the opposite to

/g2

the case of graviton, and it is in accord with the results
of garriga and tanaka.10 the overall strength of these
interactions can be also read o from ref.:10 the interac-
tion lagrangian of the normalized radion eld f (x) with
matter on each brane is l()

(17)

the fact that the radion couples to matter on the nega-
tive tension brane much stronger than the graviton does
has been observed also in refs.8, 9

it is instructive to return to (3) with the benet of
our perturbative calculation to see what the linearised
metric with the walls xed at some coordinate values, 0
and rc, should look like. to derive this form, we take
the two gn patches of (14a) and (14b), and perform a
gauge transformation to make the two identical. we now
have a single coordinate chart between the walls, but
the walls are no longer at z = 0, rc. we then perform
another coordinate transformation which is determined
by the dual requirements that the walls sit at the (new)
z coordinates 0 and rc, and that there are no cross terms
gz in the metric. the price of having the walls at a
rigid value of z is that the system is no longer gn 
a nontrivial gz z is introduced. after performing these
transformations we nd that the new metric is

ds2 = e2k(z+f (x)e2k z )g(x)dxdx (cid:0)1 + 2kf (x)e2kz(cid:1)2

(18)

dz2

where we have included the possibility of graviton per-
turbations in g (x). unlike eq. (3), this form of the
metric correctly describes both the linearized dynamics
of massless elds and x-independent displacements of the
wall (the latter correspond to constant, but not necessar-
ily small f and are accompanied by a change of z coor-
dinate). therefore, eq.(18) is expected to appropriately
describe the full long distance dynamics of the two brane
model.

clearly, the properties of the radion are quite dierent
from the graviton. to stress this point, let us introduce
a model in which gravitons are not conned, but the
radion is. this model may be of interest by itself, as in
an appropriate limit gravity on a brane is expected to be
almost, but not exactly einsteinian.

let us consider ve-dimensional space-time with in-
nite fth dimension. let there be two branes, one
with positive tension  and another with negative ten-
sion /2 (note the factor 1/2). the latter brane is
placed to the right of the former in the fth direction.
the bulk cosmological constant between the two branes
and to the left of the positive-tension one is the same as
in the randallsundrum model, and is zero to the right
of the negative-tension brane. then there exists a solu-
tion to the einstein equations for which both branes are
at rest, the coordinates of the positive and negative ten-
sion branes being z = 0 and z = rc, respectively, where

rc is again an arbitrary constant. this solution has the
form of eq.(1) but now with

a2(z) = (cid:26) e2k|z|

e2krc = const

for z < rc
for z > rc

(19)

the four-dimensional hypersurfaces z = const are at;
the ve-dimensional space-time is at to the right of the
negative tension brane, and anti-de sitter in the rest of
the bulk.

an interesting feature of this model is that gravitons
are almost but not exactly conned: the wave functions
of gravitons, h = a2(z)(x), are peaked at z = 0
but are not normalizable. at large rc, gravity experi-
enced by matter residing on the positive tension brane
should be almost, but not exactly einsteinian (the limit
rc   corresponds to the non-compact grs model,2, 3
with gravitons conned to the positive tension brane).
the background (19) is of interest for exploring possible
deviations from the einstein gravity in brane world, and,
in particular, for analyzing the issue of (non) conserva-
tion of energy measured by a four-dimensional observer.
we leave the discussion of gravitational perturbations
in our model for the future, and here we consider a sim-
pler mode, the radion. for the conned radion, the met-
ric perturbation analogous to eqs.(14a), (14b) has to be
a solution to linearized einstein equations (still in the
gauge (4)) which tends to pure gauge as z  + and
z  . we again have to consider two coordinate
patches, overlapping in a region between the branes. in
the overlap, the perturbations h(+)
 are to be
related by a gauge transformation (8).

 and h()

proceeding as above, we nd in the left patch

h(+)
 =

1

k (cid:0)1  e2kz(cid:1) f,(x)  2ka2f (x)

(20)

where f (x) is the massless radion eld. the forms of
metric perturbation in the right patch are dierent in
anti-de sitter and at parts,

the second wall k ()
 = 2e2krcf,. alternatively, the
perturbation (21) is pure gauge for z > rc, and chang-
ing coordinates to the right of the second wall so that
the metric there is minkowskian, we nd that the wall
is located at z() = rc  2e2krc f . similarly, for z < 0,
the perturbation (20) is pure gauge, and changing coor-
dinates for the rst wall gives z(+) = f , therefore we
see how f does indeed encode a relative motion of the
walls. note how the radion eld is non-trivial only in be-
tween the two branes and on the positive tension brane
itself. in other words, there is not even short-ranged ra-
dion hair outside the two-brane system. it is likely that
the absence of the radion hair outside a stack of branes
is a general property of models with innite extra dimen-
sions.

finally, we note that in our model the radion does
not induce metric perturbations on the negative tension
brane, h()
 (rc) = 0. hence, the radion does not interact
with matter residing on the negative tension brane, in
sharp contrast to the randallsundrum model discussed
above. this seems to be a peculiarity of our model, which
is related to the atness of the ve-dimensional space-
time for z > rc, since a perturbed wall in at spacetime
written in gn coordinates can be shown to have four-
dimensional metric g =  + 2zf, + o(f 2), and so
any perturbation always vanishes to leading order on the
wall.
