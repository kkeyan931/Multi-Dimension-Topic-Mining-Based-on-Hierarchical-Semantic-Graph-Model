abstract

a detailed review of recent developments in the topological classication of d-branes
in superstring theory is presented. beginning with a thorough, self-contained intro-
duction to the techniques and applications of topological k-theory, the relationships
between the classic constructions of k-theory and the recent realizations of d-branes
as tachyonic solitons, coming from bound states of higher dimensional systems of
unstable branes, are described. it is shown how the k-theory formalism naturally
reproduces the known spectra of bps and non-bps d-branes, and how it can be
systematically used to predict the existence of new states. the emphasis is placed
on the new interpretations of d-branes as conventional topological solitons in other
brane worldvolumes, how the mathematical formalism can be used to deduce the
gauge eld content on both supersymmetric and non-bps branes, and also how
k-theory predicts new relationships between the various superstring theories and
their d-brane spectra. the implementations of duality symmetries as natural iso-
morphisms of k-groups are discussed. the relationship with the standard cohomo-
logical classication is presented and used to derive an explicit formula for d-brane
charges. some string theoretical constructions of the k-theory predictions are also
briey described.

1 introduction and overview

the second superstring revolution (see [1] for reviews) came with the realization that
all ve consistent superstring theories in ten dimensions (type i, type iia/b, heterotic
so(32)/e8e8) along with 11-dimensional supergravity are merely dierent perturbation
expansions of a single 11-dimensional quantum theory called m-theory [2]. the evidence
for this is provided by the various non-perturbative duality relations that connect the

dierent corners of the moduli space of m-theory corresponding to the various string
theories. the classic examples are the self-duality of the type iib superstring [3] and the

duality between the type i and so(32) heterotic strings [2, 4].

a new impetus into the duality conjectures came with the realization that certain

nonperturbative degrees of freedom, known as dirichlet p-branes (or dp-branes for short),
are charged with respect to the p + 1-form gauge potentials of the closed string ramond-

ramond (rr) sector of type ii superstring theory [5]. dp-branes are supersymmetric
extended objects which form p + 1-dimensional hypersurfaces in spacetime on which the

endpoints of open strings can attach (with dirichlet boundary conditions). they can be
thought of as topological defects in spacetime which give explicit realizations of string
solitons [6]. the crucial observation [5] was that d-branes have precisely the correct

properties to ll out duality multiplets whose other elements are fundamental string states
and ordinary eld theoretic solitons. d-branes have thereby provided a more complete

and detailed dynamical picture of string duality. they have also provided surprising new
insights into the quantum mechanics of black holes and into the nature of spacetime at

very short distance scales.

the important property of d-branes is that they are examples of bps states, which

may be characterized by the property that their mass is completely determined by their
charge with respect to some gauge eld. they form ultra-short multiplets of the super-

symmetry algebra of the string theory, and are thereby stable and protected from quantum
radiative corrections. their properties can therefore be analysed perturbatively at weak

coupling in a given theory and then extrapolated to strong coupling where they can be
reinterpreted as non-perturbative congurations of the dual theory. for some time it was
thought that this supersymmetry property, which protects the d-brane congurations

via non-renormalization theorems, was crucial to ensure their stability and provide the
appropriate non-perturbative tests of the duality conjectures.

however, this picture of d-branes has drastically changed in the last year and a half. it
may be observed [7] that the spectrum of a superstring theory can contain states which do

not have the bps property, but which are nevertheless stable because they are the lightest
states of the theory which carry a given set of conserved quantum numbers which prevent

3

them from decaying. such stable non-bps states can be studied using standard string

perturbation theory and their properties determined at weak coupling. it has been realized
recently [8][12] that when these states are extrapolated to strong coupling, the resulting

non-perturbative conguration behaves in all respects like an ordinary d-brane (see [13]
for recent reviews). this provides a highly non-trivial check of the non-perturbative
duality conjectures beyond the level of bps congurations. for instance, this idea can

be applied to heterotic-type i duality at a non-bps level [9, 10]. the so(32) heterotic
string contains states which are not supersymmetric, but are stable because they are the

lightest states that carry the quantum numbers of the spinor representation of the so(32)
gauge group. it turns out that the corresponding non-perturbative stable conguration

which is a spinor of so(32) is the object that comes from the bound state of a type i
d-string and anti-d-string (wrapped on a circle and with a z2-valued wilson line in the
worldvolume). the d-string pair becomes tightly bound, forming a solitonic kink which
behaves exactly as a d-particle but which carries a non-additive charge taking values in
z2 that prevents one from building stacks of non-bps d-branes.

generally, this new perspective for understanding d-branes and their conserved charges

treats the branes as topological defects in the worldvolumes of higher dimensional unsta-
ble systems of branes (such as brane-antibrane pairs). such systems are unstable because
their spectrum contains a tachyonic state that is not removed by the usual gso projection.

however, it is unclear whether these modes are incurable instabilities in the system or if
they play a more subtle role in the dynamics. a better understanding of the string theory

tachyon has been recently achieved [7][9],[14][16], with the new belief that the tachyonic
mode of an open string stretching between a d-brane and an anti-d-brane (or connecting

an unstable brane to itself) is a higgs-type excitation which develops a stable vacuum
expectation value, and the unstable state decays into a stable state. congurations of un-

stable d-branes can sometimes carry lower dimensional d-brane charges, so that when the
tachyon eld rolls down to the minimum of its potential and the state decays, it leaves be-
hind a state which diers from the vacuum conguration by a lower-dimensional d-brane

charge. the resulting stable state thereby contains topological defects that correspond to
stable d-branes.

in addition to producing new d-brane congurations, the bound state construction
of branes through the process of tachyon condensation can be achieved for the known

spectrum of supersymmetric branes. this leads to various new connections between dif-
ferent types of d-branes which are known as descent relations [11],[17][19]. these

relations form a remarkable web of mappings between bps and non-bps branes that
provides various dierent ways of thinking about the origins of d-branes, and they could

lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of dierent d-branes and their roles in

4

string theory and in m-theory. the situation in the case of type ii superstring theory is

depicted in g. 1 [11, 13]. if we consider, say, a dp-brane anti-dp-brane (or dp-brane for
short) bound state pair of type iib string theory (p odd), then its open string spectrum

contains a tachyonic excitation whose ground state corresponds to the supersymmetric
vacuum conguration. however, one can consider instead a tachyonic kink solution on
the brane-antibrane pair which describes a non-bps d(p  1)-brane of the iib theory.
this system also contains a tachyonic excitation in its worldvolume eld theory, so that
one can consider a tachyonic kink solution on the d(p  1)-brane which results in a bps
d(p  2)-brane of iib.

figure 1: the relationships between dierent d-branes in type ii superstring theory. the
squares represent stable supersymmetric bps branes or a combination of such a brane with
its antibrane, while the circles depict unstable non-bps congurations. the horizontal
arrows represent the result of quotienting the theory by the operator (1)fl, the vertical
arrows the eect of constructing a tachyonic kink solution in the brane worldvolume eld
theory, and the diagonal arrows the usual t -duality transformations.

another set of relations comes from modding out the p-p brane pair by the operator
(1)fl which acts as 1 on all the ramond sector states in the left-moving part of the
fundamental string worldsheet, and leaves all other sectors unchanged. in particular, it
exchanges a d-brane with its antibrane, so that a brane-antibrane pair is invariant under
(1)fl and it makes sense to take the quotient of this conguration. a careful study of the
open string spectrum reveals that the result is a non-supersymmetric dp-brane of iia, and

5

that a further quotient by (1)fl yields a supersymmetric p-brane of iib [11, 20]. when
combined with the usual t -duality transformations between the type iib and iia theories
[21], we nd that any p-brane conguration in type ii superstring theory may be obtained

from any higher dimensional brane conguration. in particular, all branes of the type ii
theories descend from a bound state of d9-d9 pairs. thus all possible stable d-branes
appear as topological defects in the worldvolume tachyonic higgs eld on the spacetime

lling d9-branes, so that the spacetime lling brane system provides a universal medium
in which all stable d-brane charges are carried by conventional topological solitons.

the standard coupling in type ii superstring theory of a bps dp-brane to a closed

string p + 1-form rr potential c (p+1) is described by the action [5]

s(p) = (p) zmp

c (p+1)

(1.1)

where (p) is the p + 1-form charge of the p-brane. in addition, the topological charge on
the worldvolume manifold mp of a dp-brane couples to the spacetime rr elds through
generalized wess-zumino type actions [22, 23] (here we work in string units with 2 =
1 and suppress the dependence on the neveu-schwarz two-form eld b as well as on
correction terms due to non-vanishing manifold curvature):

s(p)

wz = (p) zmp

tr(cid:16)ef(cid:17) xp

c (p+1)

(1.2)

where f is the eld strength of some gauge eld which lives on mp. the nature of the
gauge elds depends on the congurations of d-branes. when n branes are brought
innitesimally close to one another, their generic u(1)n gauge symmetry is enhanced
to g = u(n) [24]. this introduces the possibility of embedding supersymmetric gauge
theories of various dimensions into string theory (see [25] for a review). the coupling (1.2)

also allows an alternative interpretation of the topological charge as the rr charge due to
the presence of lower dimensional branes in the worldvolume of higher dimensional branes
[23, 26]. this enables the topological classication of rr charge in terms of worldvolume

defects [27] in much the same spirit as that described above.

in fact, the new understanding of the tachyon in an unstable brane conguration as a
higgs type excitation in the spectrum of open string states leads to a topological classi-
cation of the resulting brane charges when d-branes are viewed as the tachyonic solitons.

generally, the topological charges of these objects are determined by the homotopy groups
of a homogeneous space g/h, where g is a compact lie group and h is a closed subgroup

of g. the bration

with i the inclusion and  the canonical projection, induces a long exact sequence of

homotopy groups,

. . .  n1(h)

i

 n1(g) 

 n1(g/h) 

 n2(h)  . . . .

(1.4)

in the present case, g is the worldvolume gauge group of a given conguration of branes
and the tachyon scalar eld t is a higgs eld for the breaking of the gauge symmetry

down to the subgroup h. the tachyonic soliton must be accompanied by a worldvolume
gauge eld a of corresponding topological charge in the unbroken subgroup of the gauge

group, in order that the energy per unit worldvolume of the induced lower dimensional
brane be nite. it can be argued [7, 9] that the brane worldvolume eld theory admits

nite energy, static soliton solutions which have asymptotic pure gauge congurations at
innity,

t  tv u

,

a  i u 1 du

(1.5)

where tv is a constant, and u is a g/h valued function corresponding to the identity
map (of a given winding number) from the asymptotic boundary of the worldvolume
soliton to the group manifold of the space g/h of vacua. this leads to topologically

distinct sectors in the space of all eld congurations, and the charges which distinguish
these sectors take values in the appropriate homotopy group of the vacuum manifold.

precisely, if the induced brane conguration has codimension n in the higher dimensional
worldvolume, then the corresponding soliton carries topological charge taking values in
n1(g/h). this homotopy group may be computed using the exact sequence (1.4)
[27] (for instance, if the induced boundary homomorphism  is trivial mapping, so that
ker  = n1(g/h), then n1(g/h) = n1(g)/n1(h)).

the coupling (1.1) would seem to imply that, since the massless rr elds c (p+1) are
dierential forms, the rr charges of d-branes are determined by cohomology classes, i.e.
by integrating the c (p+1) over suitable cycles of the spacetime manifold x. however, the
new interpretation of d-brane charge as a topological charge actually suggests a dierent

characterization (at least when all spacetime dimensions are much larger than the string
scale so that no new stringy phenomena occur). let us consider type iib superstring

theory, and go back to the realization of rr charge in terms of a conguration of n
9-branes and m 9-branes. type ii theories have no gauge group, so in order to cancel

the tadpole anomaly there must be the same number of 9-branes and 9-branes, n = m.
the 9-branes and 9-branes ll out the spacetime manifold x. the system of n 9-branes
carries a u(n) gauge bundle e and the system of n 9-branes carries a u(n) gauge bundle
f . the system of 9 9-branes can therefore be labelled by a pair of u(n) vector bundles
(e, f ) which characterize the gauge eld congurations corresponding to the soliton.

we would now like to determine when two such pairs of bundles (e, f ) and (e, f )

7

should be considered equivalent. they should be regarded the same if they determine

the same topological class of the soliton. it turns out that the basic equivalence relation
is brane-antibrane creation and annihilation. the 9  9 and 9  9 open strings have
the opposite gso projection, so that the massless vector elds are projected out and
the tachyonic mode survives [14]. as we have discussed above, it is conjectured that
the instability associated with the tachyon represents a ow toward annihilation of the

brane-antibrane pair, i.e. by giving the tachyon eld a suitable expectation value one can
return to the vacuum state without this pair [7][9]. thus if we add an equal number

m of 9-branes and 9-branes with the same u(m) gauge bundle h on them, then the
tachyon eld associated with the open strings stretched between the 9-branes and the

9-branes is a section of a trivial bundle, and hence it can condense to the minimum of
its potential everywhere on the 9  9 worldvolume. we suppose that any such collection
of brane-antibrane pairs can be created and annihilated, so that the conguration is
equivalent to the vacuum which carries no d-brane charges (this is much like the situation
in ordinary quantum eld theory). we conclude that adding such pairs has no eect on the

topological class of the soliton, i.e. the pair (e, f ) can be smoothly deformed to the pair
(e  h, f  h) for any such bundle h. thus in terms of the conserved d-brane charges,
a property of the system that is invariant under smooth deformations, we conclude that
rr-charge is classied topologically by specifying a pair of u(n) vector bundles (e, f )

subject to the equivalence relation

(e, f )  (e  h, f  h)

(1.6)

for any u(m) vector bundle h. in a manner of speaking (that will soon be made precise),
the d-brane charge is determined by the dierence between the chan-paton gauge

bundles on the 9-branes and anti-9-branes.

the mathematical conditions described above dene the so-called k-theory group

k(x) of the spacetime x. this proposal that d-brane charge takes values in the k-theory
of spacetime was made initially in [17], and then extended in [18, 19],[28][33]. however,

the solitonic description of d-brane states discussed above was not the rst evidence that
rr-charge should be understood in terms of k-theory rather than cohomology. the

strongest prior proposal [34] had been the observation (extending earlier calculations in
[22, 23, 26, 35]) that when a d-brane wraps a submanifold y of spacetime, its rr-charge
depends on the geometry of y , of its normal bundle and on the gauge elds on y in a

manner which suggests that d-brane charges take values in k(x). other earlier hints at
a connection with k-theory may be found in [36, 37].

the arguments presented above for spacetime lling branes clearly show that when
a d-brane wraps a submanifold y of the spacetime x, its charges are classied by the

8

group k(y ). one of the profound observations of [17] is that there is a standard k-

theory construction, called the thom isomorphism, which embeds k(y ) into k(x) and
is equivalent to the bound state construction of d-branes described above, and hence

to the representation of all branes in terms of 9-branes and antibranes.
in this way,
one gets a complete classication of d-brane charges in terms of the topology of the
underlying spacetime manifold. the main feature of k-theory which parallels the above

soliton constructions is its intimate relationship with homotopy theory. moreover, another
standard k-theory construction, known as the atiyah-bott-shapiro construction, can be

used to obtain explicit forms for the classical gauge eld congurations which live on a
given d-brane. these remarkable facts have been used to reproduce the construction of the

type i non-bps d-particle discovered in [9], and to predict the existence of new d-branes
in the spectrum of the type i theory and also other superstring theories (the homotopic

soliton construction of the type i d-string was rst carried out in [38]).
indeed, the
k-groups of a spacetime can be much more general than the corresponding cohomology
groups. in many instances the k-groups can have torsion while the cohomology groups

are torsion free, lending a natural explanation to the fact some d-branes (such as the
type i 0-brane) carry torsion charges [34]. the recent string theoretical construction of

these new type i objects [39] illustrates the strong predictions that can follow from the
k-theory formalism. in addition, for the spectrum of supersymmetric d-branes (where

the rr charge is integer valued) there is a mapping, known as the chern homomorphism,
onto cohomology, thereby making contact with the expectations which follow from the

coupling (1.1) to the spacetime rr elds.

1.1 outline

in this paper we will review the mathematical formalism of topological k-theory and
its use as a systematic tool in the topological classication of d-branes in superstring

theory. as k-theory now turns out to be at the forefront of mathematical physics as far
as its applications to string theory are concerned and, while cohomology and dierential
geometry are already well-known to most theoretical physicists, k-theory may seem rather

obscure, we have attempted to merge the mathematics with the physics in such a way
that the naturality of k-theory as a classication tool is evident. the main purpose will

be to collect all the relevant mathematical material in one place in a way that should be
accessible to a rather general audience of string theorists and mathematicians. the level

of this review is geared at string theorists with a relatively good background in algebraic
topology and dierential geometry (at the level of the books [40] and the review article
[41]), and at mathematicians with a rudimentary background in string theory (at the level

of the books [42]). more references and background will be given as we proceed.

9

before giving a quick outline of the structure of this paper, let us briey indicate the

omissions in our presentation, which can also be taken as directions for further research.
throughout this review we will consider only superstring compactications for which

the curvature of the neveu-schwarz b-eld is cohomologically trivial. the problems
with incorporating this two-form eld are discussed in [17], and at present it is not fully
understood what the appropriate k-theory should be in these instances. some steps in

this direction have appeared recently in [33, 43, 44]. related to this problem is how to
correctly incorporate s-duality into k-theoretic terms, and in particular the description

of the self-duality of type iib superstring theory. the analysis of [43] is a rst step in
this direction. another related aspect is making contact with the correct construction for

m-theory. the description of m-branes has been discussed in [33, 43] and the appropriate
relations in matrix theory in [45]. using the approach of [33], which is based on algebraic

k-theory, there may be an intimate connection with the gauge bundles for matrix theory
compactications used in [46] based on noncommutative geometry. these are all problems
that do not as of yet have a natural description in terms of k-theory. it is hoped that

the exposition of this paper, in addition to providing the reader with the necessary tools
to pursue the subject further, could provoke some detailed investigations of such matters.

finally, we note that the analysis given in the following is meant to serve only as a
topological classication of the spectra of branes in the various string theories. the

second step, which is omitted in this review, is to actually carry out string theoretical
constructions of the d-branes predicted by the k-theory formalism and hence describe

their dynamics, especially for the new non-bps states. this is addressed in [7][13],[17,
29, 32, 39]. indeed, the k-theory classication of d-branes has revealed many interesting
new eects and constructions in string theory. we shall only briey touch upon such

matters here, in order to keep the presentation as self-contained as possible.

the structure of this review is as follows. in section 2 we present a thorough, self-
contained introduction to the ideas and fundamental constructions of topological k-
theory. this section deals with the mathematical highlights of the formalism that will

follow in subsequent sections. many tools for computing k-groups are described which
are useful in particular to the various superstring applications that we shall discuss. they

will in addition turn out to give many unexpected connections between the various dif-
ferent superstring theories. here the reader is assumed to have a good background in

algebraic topology and the theory of ber bundles. in section 3 we begin the classication
of d-branes using k-theory, starting with the simplest case of type iib superstring the-
ory. we start by giving a quick description of the relevant physics of the brane-antibrane

pair. for more details, the reader is refered to the original papers [7][12] and the recent
review articles [13]. we then describe the bound state construction and how it naturally

10

implies the pertinent connection to k-theory, following [17] for the most part. in section

4 we carry out the analogous constructions for type iia superstring theory. the relevant
k-theory for type iia d-branes was suggested in [17] and developed in detail in [18]. in

section 5 we then move on to type i superstring theory, in which new non-bps d-branes
are predicted, again following [17] for a large part. in section 6 we turn our attention
to orbifold and orientifold superstring theories. orbifolds were dealt with in [28] while

orientifolds were described in [29, 19]. the various t -dual orientifolds of the type i the-
ory were discussed in [18, 32, 19]. finally, we conclude our analysis in section 7 with a

description of the modications of the previous constructs when global topology of the
spacetime and of the worldvolume embeddings is taken into account. here we present the

global version of the bound state construction, as described in [17], highlighting the extra
structures and care that must be taken into account as compared to previous cases of at

manifolds. we then move on to describe the appropriate k-theory for dealing with general
superstring compactications [32], and introduce a useful connection to the index theory
of dirac operators which has been at the forefront of many applications in theoretical

physics (see [41] for a comprehensive review). we then apply these ideas to describe how
the celebrated t -duality transformations of d-branes are represented as natural isomor-

phisms of k-theory groups [30, 32]. we end the review with what can be considered as
the origin of the material discussed in this paper, the derivation of the k-theoretic charge

formula of [34]. this formula gives the explicit relationship between the k-theoretic and
cohomological descriptions of rr charge, and it thereby allows one to explicitly compute

d-brane charges in terms of densities integrated over the spacetime manifold.

2 elements of topological k-theory

k-theory was rst introduced in the 1950s by grothendieck in an alternative formulation
of the riemann-roch theorem (see [47]).
it was subsequently developed in the 1960s

by atiyah and hirzebruch who rst introduced the general k-theory group k(x) of a
topological space x [48]. since then, k-theory has become an indispensable tool in many

areas of topology, dierential geometry and algebra. generally speaking, topological k-
theory can be regarded as a cohomology theory for vector bundles that emphasizes features

which become prominent as the ranks of the vector bundles become large. actually, it is
an example of a generalized cohomology theory, in that k-theory does not satisfy all of
the eilenberg-steenrod axioms [49] of a cohomology theory (it satises all axioms except

the dimension axiom which denes in advance the cohomology of the topological space
consisting of a single point, e.g. h n(pt, z) = n,0 z). this extensive section will review
the core of the mathematical material that we will need later on in this paper and no

11

mention of physics will be made until section 3. we will not give a complete review of the

material, but rather focus only on those aspects that are useful in superstring applications.
for more complete expositions of the subject, the reader is refered to the books [50][53],

where the proofs of the theorems quoted in the following may also be found.

2.1 the grothendieck group

in this subsection we shall start with an abstract formulation that will naturally lead to

the denition of the group k(x). although the formalism is not really required for this
denition, it will be of use later on, and moreover it is this denition which allows one to

generalize the k-theory of topological spaces to more exotic groups, such as the k-theory
of vector spaces, c -algebras, etc., which could prove important in future applications of
the general formalism of k-theory to string theory and m-theory. let a be an abelian
monoid, i.e. a set with an addition which satises all the axioms of a group except possibly
the existence of an inverse. one can naturally associate to a an abelian group s(a) by
the following construction. consider the equivalence relation  on the cartesian product
monoid a  a with (e, f )  (e, f ) if there exists an element g  a such that

e + f  + g = f + e + g .

(2.1)

the abelian group s(a), called the symmetrization of a, is then dened to be the set of
equivalence classes of such pairs:

s(a) = a  a/  .

(2.2)

the equivalence class of the pair (e, f ) is denoted by [(e, f )] and the inverse of such an
element in s(a) is [(f, e)]. this follows from the fact that for any e  a, [(e, e)] is a
representative of the zero element in s(a). an alternative denition of s(a) is obtained
by using in a a the equivalence relation (e, f )  (e, f ) if there exist g, h  a such
that

(e, f ) + (g, g) = (e, f ) + (h, h) .

(2.3)
as a simple example, for a = z+ (the non-negative integers under addition), we have
s(a) = z. also, for a = z  {0} (an abelian monoid under multiplication), we have
s(a) = q  {0}.

the completion s(a) of the monoid a can be characterized by the following universal
property. for any abelian group g, and any homomorphism f : a  g of the underlying
monoids, there exists a unique homomorphism f : s(a)  g such that f  s = f , where
s is the natural map a  s(a) dened by s(e) = [(e, 0)]. this means that s(a) is the
smallest abelian group that can be built from the abelian monoid a and it implies, in

12

particular, that if a is itself a group, then s(a) = a. in general, this property implies
that the map a  s(a) is a covariant functor from the category of abelian monoids
if  : a  b is any homomorphism of monoids,
to the category of abelian groups, i.e.
then there is a unique group homomorphism s() : s(a)  s(b) such that the following
diagram is commutative:

a
s 

 b
 s

(2.4)

s(a)

s()

 s(b)

and such that s(  ) = s()  s(), s(ida) = ids(a) (here ida denotes the identity
morphism on a).

an important example to which this construction applies is the case that c is an
additive category with (c) the set of isomorphism classes of elements e  c, which we
denote by [e]. (c) becomes an abelian monoid if we dene [e] + [f ]  [e  f ] (this is
well-dened since the isomorphism class of ef depends only on the isomorphism classes
of e and f ). the grothendieck group of c is dened as k(c) = s((c)). note that every
element of k(c) can be written as a formal dierence [e]  [f ] and that [e]  [f ] =
[e] [f ] in k(c) if and only if there exists a g  c such that e  f   g = e  f  g.
notice also that [e] = [f ] if and only if there is a g  c such that e  g = f  g. as a
simple example, let f be an algebraic eld (e.g. f = r or c), and let c be the category
of nite dimensional vector spaces over f whose morphisms are linear transformations.

then, since such nite dimensional vector spaces are characterized uniquely by their
dimension, (c) = z+ implying that k(c) = z.

2.2 the group k(x)

we will use the construction of the previous subsection for a classication of vector bundles
over compact manifolds. let x be a compact manifold and let c = vect(x) be the
additive category of complex vector bundles over x with respect to bundle morphisms

and whitney sum (later on we shall also consider real and quaternionic vector bundles).

dene i k to be the trivial bundle of rank k over x, i.e. i k = x  ck. the space of all

vector bundles can be partitioned into equivalence classes as follows. bundle e over x
is said to be stably equivalent to bundle f , denoted by e  f , if there exists positive
integers j, k such that

e  i j = f  i k .

(2.5)

13

the corresponding equivalence classes in vect(x)/  are called stable equivalence classes.
it is easily seen that if e, f and g are vector bundles over x then

e  g = f  g  e  f ,

(2.6)

i.e. e and f are stably equivalent.
in the proof one uses the fact that there exists a
bundle g such that g g is trivial (according to swans theorem this requires x to be
a compact hausdor manifold). however, one cannot conclude from the left-hand side of
(2.6) that e and f are isomorphic as vector bundles. for example, consider e = t sn,
the tangent bundle of the n-sphere sn, and g = n(sn, rn+1), the normal bundle of sn
in rn+1. g has a global section given by an outward-pointing unit normal vector, which
implies that it is trivial with n(sn, rn+1) = i 1. furthermore, we have the usual relations

i n+1 = t rn+1 = e  g = e  i 1 .

(2.7)

however, e = t sn is generally not trivial and therefore not equal to i n (in fact t sn is
only trivial for parallelizable spheres corresponding to n = 1, 3, 7). so generally, t sn is
only stably trivial.

this example demonstrates that the space of vector bundles over x is not a group
under the whitney sum of vector bundles, but rather a monoid, as there is no subtraction

dened for vector bundles. a group can, using the previous setup, be constructed as
follows. the k-group of a compact manifold x is dened to be the grothendieck group
of the category vect(x), k(x)  k(vect(x)), or

k(x) = vect(x)  vect(x)/  ,

(2.8)

where we have dened an equivalence relation in vect(x)vect(x) according to (e, f ) 
(e, f ) if there exists a vector bundle g  vect(x) such that

e  f   g = e  f  g .

(2.9)

an equivalent denition of k(x) is that the pair of bundles (e, f ) is taken to be equivalent
to (e h, f  h) for any bundle h. often the notation k0(x) or ku(x) is also used for
this group. an element of k(x) is written as [(e, f )]. in k(x) the unit (zero) element is
[(e, e)] so the inverse of the class [(e, f )] is [(f, e)]. any element [(e, f )] can therefore
be identied with [e]  [f ] where [e] = [(e, i n)]. furthermore, [e] = [f ] in k(x)
if and only if e and f are stably equivalent. the elements of k(x) are called virtual
bundles. the map x  k(x) is a contravariant functor from the category of compact
if f : x  y is continuous,
topological spaces to the category of abelian groups, i.e.
then it induces the usual pullback map on vector bundles over y , thus inducing a map
f  : vect(y )  vect(x) and hence a homomorphism k(y )  k(x).

14

the k-groups have the following important homotopy invariance property. consider
two homotopic maps f, g : x  y . then for any vector bundle e  y , there is an
isomorphism of vector bundles over x:

from this it follows that the maps induced by f and g on k-groups are the same:

f e = ge .

s(f ) = s(g) : k(y )  k(x) .

(2.10)

(2.11)

for example, if x is a compact manifold which is contractible to a point, then we may

deduce that k(x) = k(pt) = z. geometrically, this expresses the well-known fact
that any vector bundle over a contractible space x is necessarily trivial, so that the
corresponding k-theory of x is also trivial.

2.3 reduced k-theory

the fact that a vector bundle over a point is just a vector space, so that k(pt) = z,

motivates the introduction of a reduced k-theory in which the topological space consisting

of a single point has trivial cohomology, ek(pt) = 0, and therefore also ek(x) = 0 for any

contractible space x. let us x a basepoint of x and consider the collapsing and inclusion
maps:

p : x  pt

,

i : pt  x .

(2.12)

these maps induce, respectively, an epimorphism and a monomorphism of the correspond-
ing k-groups:

p : k(pt) = z  k(x)

,

i : k(x)  k(pt) = z .

(2.13)

we then have the exact sequences of groups:

p

i

 k(x)  ek(x)  0
 z  0 .

0  z
0  ek(x)  k(x)

these sequences have a canonical splitting so that the homomorphism i is a left inverse
of p. the kernel of the map i, or equivalently the cokernel of the map p, is called the

reduced k-theory group and is denoted by ek(x),

and therefore we have the fundamental decomposition

ek(x) = ker i = coker p

k(x) = z  ek(x) .

15

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

given a vector bundle e  x, let ex denote the ber of e over x  x. we dene
the rank function rk : x  z+ by rk(x) = dimc ex. since e is locally trivial, the rank
function is locally constant, and the space of all locally constant z+-valued functions on
x forms an abelian monoid h 0(x, z+) under pointwise addition. the map rk extends
naturally to a group homomorphism

rk : k(x)  h 0(x, z)

rk(cid:16)[e]  [f ](cid:17) = rk(e)  rk(f ) .

the integer (2.17) is called the virtual dimension of [(e, f )]  k(x). let k(x) = ker rk.
then the short exact sequence

0  k(x)  k(x) rk h 0(x, z)  0

(2.18)

has a canonical split (i.e.
h 0(x, z) = z and

rk has a right inverse), so that if x is connected, then

(2.17)

(2.19)

ek(x) = k(x) = ker rk .

(i.e. consisting of equivalence classes of pairs of vector bundles [(e, f )] of equal rank).

in this case ek(x) is the subgroup of k(x) whose elements have virtual dimension zero
the fundamental examples are ek(s2n) = z and ek(s2n+1) = 0 for any positive integer n

(these groups are computed in section 2.7). note that the rank function (2.17) naturally
gives an assignment ch0(e) in the zeroth cech cohomology group of x which depends
only on the stable equivalence class of the vector bundle e in k(x). this is the rst,

basic example of the chern character which will be discussed in section 7.1.

for the physical applications of k-theory, which are presented in the subsequent sec-

tions, we shall mostly work in k-theory with compact support. this means that for each
class [(e, f )], there is a map t : e  f which is an isomorphism of vector bundles
outside an open set u  x whose closure u is compact. this condition automatically
implies that e and f have the same rank, and hence we shall mostly deal with the reduced
k-group ek(x). the corresponding virtual bundle may then be represented as
when x is not compact, we dene k(x) = ek(x +), where x + is the one-point compact-

h(e , f )i =h(ker t , coker t )i

ication of x.

(2.20)

2.4 higher k-theory and bott periodicity

starting with k(x) there is a natural way to dene so-called higher k-groups. these
groups are labelled by a positive integer n = 0, 1, 2, . . . and are dened according to

kn(x) = k(nx) ,

(2.21)

16

where nx  sn  x is the n-th reduced suspension of the topological space x. here
x  y = x  y /(x  y ) is the smash product of x and y , and x  y is their reduced
join, i.e. their disjoint union with a base point of each space identied, which can be
viewed as the subspace x  pt pt y of the cartesian product x  y . for x = sn, the
n-sphere, one has sn = s1  sn = sn+1. alternatively, higher k-groups can be dened

through the suspension isomorphism:

kn(x) = k(x  rn) ,

(2.22)

where it is always understood that k-theory with compact support is used. in contrast to
conventional cohomology theories, one does not in this way generate an innite number

of higher k-groups because of the fundamental bott periodicity theorem:

kn(x) = kn2(x) ,

(2.23)

which states that the complex k-theory functor kn is periodic with period two. the

same is true for the reduced functor ekn since the analogous denition to (2.21) holds for

reduced k-theory. however, the higher reduced and unreduced k-groups dier according

to

since k(pt) = z, k1(pt) = 0, using bott periodicity we see that for n even these
groups dier by a subgroup z (as in (2.16)), while for n odd they are identical, so that

kn(x) = ekn(x)  kn(pt) .

(2.24)

any positive integer n.

ek1(x) = k1(x). here the basic examples are k1(s2n) = 0 and k1(s2n+1) = z for
note that for any decomposition x = x1  x2      xn of x into a disjoint union
of open subspaces, the inclusions of the xi into x induce a decomposition of k-groups as
kn(x) = kn(x1) kn(x2)   kn(xn) (this follows from the fact that a bundle
over x may be characterized by its restriction to xi). however, this is not true for the
reduced k-functor, since for example ek(s0) = z but ek(pt) = 0. more generally, given
two closed subspaces x1 and x2 of a locally compact space x with x = x1  x2, there
is the long exact sequence

. . .  kn1(x1)  kn1(x2)

v kn1(x1  x2) 

 kn(x1  x2)

u kn(x1)  kn(x2)

v kn(x1  x2)  . . . ,

(2.25)

where  is the zig-zag homomorphism, and u and v are dened by u([e]) = ([e|x1], [e|x2])
and v([e1], [e2]) = [e1|x1x2]  [e2|x1x2]. the corresponding long exact sequence for
two open subspaces u1 and u2 of x with x = u1  u2 is

. . .  kn1(u1)  kn1(u2)  kn1(u1  u2) 

17

 kn(u1  u2)  kn(u1)  kn(u2)  kn(u1  u2)  . . . .

(2.26)

these latter two sequences are the analogs of the usual mayer-vietoris long exact se-
quences in cohomology.

2.5 multiplicative structures

as in any cohomology theory, k(x) and ek(x) are actually rings. in this case the multi-
plication is induced by the tensor product e  f of vector bundles over x  x:

k(x) z k(x)  k(x) ,

and is dened by

h(e , f )ih(e , f )i  h(e  e  f  f  , e  f   f  e)i

(2.27)

(2.28)

where  : x  x  x is the diagonal map. this multiplication comes from writing
[(e, f )] = [e]  [f ] and formally using distributivity of the tensor product acting on
virtual bundles. note that it acts on [(e, f )] as if es are bosonic and f s are fermionic.
it is therefore an example of a z2-graded tensor product. there is another product, called
the external tensor product or cup product, which is a homomorphism

k(x) z k(y )  k(x  y )

(2.29)

dened as follows. consider the canonical projections x : xy  x and y : xy 
y . these projections induce homomorphisms between k-groups according to


x : k(x)  k(x  y ) , 

y : k(y )  k(x  y ) .

(2.30)

then the cup product of ([e], [f ])  k(x) z k(y ) is the class [e]  [f ] in k(x  y ),
with

[e]  [f ]  

x(cid:16)[e](cid:17)  

y(cid:16)[f ](cid:17) .

(2.31)

(2.32)

consider now the canonical injective inclusion and surjective projection maps:

x  y  x  y  x  y .

the ekn functor is contravariant, and thus, as in any cohomology theory, this induces a

split short exact sequence of k-groups

0  ekn(x  y )  ekn(x  y )  ekn(x  y )  0 ,

(2.33)

18

from which it follows that

ekn(x  y ) = ekn(x  y )  ekn(x  y )

= ekn(x  y )  ekn(x)  ekn(y ) .

the formula (2.34) is particularly useful for computing the k-groups of cartesian prod-
ucts. as an important example, consider the case that y = s1, for which we nd

(2.34)

(2.35)

(2.36)

(2.37)

(2.38)

ek(x  s1) = ek(x  s1)  ek(x)  ek(s1)

= k1(x)  ek(x) ,

since ek(s1) = 0 and ek(s1  x) = k1(x). precisely, the canonical inclusion i : x 
x  s1 induces a projection i : ek(x  s1)  ek(x) such that ker i = k1(x). in other
words, k1(x) can be identied with the set of k-theory classes in ek(x  s1) which
vanish when restricted to x  pt. likewise,

k1(x  s1) = k1(x  s1)  k1(x)  k1(s1)

= ek(x)  k1(x)  z ,

where we have used bott periodicity.

the action of the cup product (2.29) on reduced k-theory can also be deduced using

(2.16) and (2.34) to get

(cid:16)ek(x) z ek(y )(cid:17)  r  ek(x  y )  r ,

where r = ek(x)ek(y ) z. since the group r appears on both sides of (2.37), we can

eliminate it by an appropriate restriction and thereby arrive at the homomorphism

ek(x) z ek(y )  ek(x  y ) .

when either k(x) or k(y ) is a free abelian group, the mappings in (2.29) and (2.38) are

isomorphisms.

one can also calculate kn(x  y ) in a manner that keeps track of the multiplicative
structure of the theory. dene k#(x) to be the z2-graded ring k#(x) = k(x)k1(x).
then, whenever k#(x) or k#(y ) is freely generated, we get the k-theory analog of the
cohomological kunneth theorem:

k#(x  y ) = k#(x) z k#(y ) .

(2.39)

(in the general case there are correction terms on the right-hand side of (2.39) which take

into account the torsion subgroups of the k-groups [54]). explicitly, (2.39) leads to

k(x  y ) = (cid:16)k(x) z k(y )(cid:17) (cid:16)k1(x) z k1(y )(cid:17) ,
k1(x  y ) = (cid:16)k(x) z k1(y )(cid:17) (cid:16)k1(x) z k(y )(cid:17) .

(2.40)

19

for example, since y = s1 has freely generated k-groups, using k(s1) = k1(s1) = z,
we again arrive at (2.35) and (2.36). similarly, taking y = s2n and y = s2n+1 in (2.39)
gives

k(x  s2n) = k(x)  k(x) ,
k(x  s2n+1) = k(x)  k1(x) ,

(2.41)

(2.42)

as k(x)-modules.

if we choose y = s2, then the maps in (2.29) and (2.38) are actually isomorphisms
which can be identied with the bott periodicity property of the reduced and unreduced
k-groups. replacing x by its n-th reduced suspension in (2.38) gives

which yields the isomorphism

ek(nx) z ek(s2) = ek(nx  s2) ,

(2.43)

(2.44)

 : ekn(x) z ek(s2)  ekn2(x) .

the generator [nc]  [i 1] of ek(s2) = z may be described by taking nc to be the
canonical line bundle over the complex projective space cp 1, which is associated with
the hopf bration s3  s2 that classies the dirac monopole [53, 55]. the isomorphism
(2.23) is then given by the mapping

h(e , f )i 7 h(e  nc , f  nc)i ,

(2.45)

for [(e, f )]  ekn(x).

2.6 relative k-theory

we will now dene a relative k-group k(x, y ) which depends on a pair of spaces (x, y ),
where y is a closed submanifold of x, and whose classes can be identied with pairs
if y 6= , then the topological coset x/y is dened to be the
of bundles over x/y .
space x with y shrunk to a point. if y is empty we identify x/y with the one-point
compactication x + of x.

first we explain how to describe vector bundles over the quotient space x/y , given a
vector bundle e over x. let  be a trivialization of e over y  x, i.e. an isomorphism
 y  v . dene an equivalence relation on e|y by taking e  e|y equivalent to
 : e|y
e  e|y if and only if

  (e) =   (e) ,

(2.46)

20

where  : y  v  v is the canonical projection. this equivalence relation identies
points in the restriction of e to y which are on the same level relative to the trivializa-
tion . we then extend this relation trivially to the whole of e. the corresponding set of
equivalence classes e can be shown to be a vector bundle over x/y , whose isomorphism
class depends only on the homotopy class of the trivialization  of e over y  x. in
fact, there is a one-to-one correspondence between vector bundles over the quotient space

x/y and vector bundles over x whose restriction to y is a trivial bundle.

the relative k-group is now dened as

k(x, y )  ek(x/y ) .

(2.47)

then k(x, y ) is a contravariant functor of the pair (x, y ) and, since k(x) = ek(x +)
(recall k(x) = ek(x)  k(pt)), we have k(x,) = k(x). the excision theorem states
that the projection  : x  x/y induces an isomorphism
 : k(x/y, pt)  k(x, y ) .

(2.48)

likewise, one can dene higher relative k-groups by

kn(x, y ) = k(x  bn, x  sn1  y  bn) ,

(2.49)

where bn = {x  rn : |x|  1} is the unit ball in rn and sn1 = bn. alternatively,
there are the suspension isomorphisms

kn(x, y ) = k(cid:16)(x  y )  rn(cid:17) .

the relative k-groups have the usual bott periodicity:

kn(x, y ) = kn2(x, y ) .

(2.50)

(2.51)

let i : y  x and j : (x,)  (x, y ) be inclusions. then there is an exact sequence
(2.52)

k(x, y )

j

 k(y ) .
if y is further equipped with a base-point, then the sequence

 k(x)

i

k(x, y )  ek(x)  ek(y )

(2.53)

is exact. more generally, one of the most important properties of the k-groups is that

they possess the excision property, which means that they satisfy the barratt-puppe long
exact sequence:

. . .  kn1(x)  kn1(y ) 

 kn(x, y )  kn(x)  kn(y ) 

 . . . ,

(2.54)

21

where  is the boundary homomorphism. the long exact sequence (2.54) connects the
k-groups of x and y  x, and it is in precisely this sense that k-theory is similar to
a cohomology theory. using bott periodicity, this sequence can be amazingly truncated
to a six-term exact sequence. if y is a retract of x (i.e. if the inclusion map i : y  x
admits a left inverse), then the sequence (2.52) splits giving

kn(x) = kn(x, y )  kn(y ) .

(2.55)

the concept of relative k-theory can be reformulated in a way that will prove useful
later on. let (x, y ) be the set of triples (e, f ; ), where e, f  vect(x) and  :
 f|y is an isomorphism of vector bundles when restricted to y . two such triples
e|y
(e, f ; ) and (e, f ; ) are said to be isomorphic if there exist isomorphims f : e  e
and g : f  f  such that the diagram
e|y
f |y 
e|y

 f|y
 g|y
 f |y



(2.56)

commutes. a triple (e, f ; ) is called elementary if e = f and  is homotopic to ide|y
within automorphisms of e|y . the sum of (e, f ; ) and (e, f ; ) is dened to be

(e, f ; )  (e, f ; )  (e  e, f  f ;   ) ,

(2.57)

under which (x, y ) becomes an abelian monoid. now consider the following equivalence
relation in (x, y ). we take the triple (e, f ; ) to be equivalent to (e, f ; ) whenever
there exist two elementary triples (g, h; ) and (g, h ; ) such that

(e, f ; )  (g, h; ) = (e, f ; )  (g, h ; ) .

(2.58)

the set of equivalence classes of such triples (which we denote by [e, f ; ]) under the
operation  becomes an abelian group which can be identied with the relative k-group,
k(x, y ) = (x, y )/ . note that [e, f ; ] = 0 in k(x, y ) if and only if there exist
vector bundles g, h  vect(x) and bundle isomorphisms u : e g  h, v : f  g  h
such that v|y  (  idg|y )  u1|y is homotopic to idh|y within automorphisms of h|y .
moreover, [e, f ; ] + [f, e; 1] = 0. notice also that the group k(x) can in this
formalism be described as the set of triples [e, f ; ], where  : e  f is a bundle
isomorphism dened in a neighbourhood of the innity of the one-point compactication

of x. this is precisely the statement that was made in (2.20).

the basic properties of k(x, y ) are as follows. first, if ,  are isomorphisms e|y


f|y as described above and if  and  are homotopic within isomorphisms from e|y to

22

f|y , then [e, f ; ] = [e, f ; ]. also, when [e, f ; ] and [f, g; ] are elements of k(x, y )
then their sum is given by the relation [e, f ; ] + [f, g; ] = [e, g;   ]. thirdly, two
elements of k(x, y ) determine the same equivalence class, [e, f ; ] = [e, f ; ], in
k(x, y ) if and only if there exist triples (g, g; idg|y ) and (g, g; idg|y ), and maps
f : e  g  e  g, g : f  g  f   g such that the diagram

idg|y (f  g)|y

(e  g)|y

f |y 

 g|y

(2.59)

(e  g)|y

idg|y (f   g)|y

commutes. furthermore, the cup product naturally extends to relative k-theory to give

the unique bilinear homomorphism

k(x, y ) z k(x , y )  k(x  x , x  y   y  x ) .

(2.60)

this agrees with the cup product introduced earlier when y = y  = . explicitly, the
product of two k-theory classes [e, f ; ] and [e, f ; ] is obtained using the product
(2.28) on the pairs of vector bundles and the product isomorphism

 =    id

id     id ! .

id  

(2.61)

acting on (2.28) (note that this requires the introduction of ber metrics on the bundles

involved).

as a simple example, consider the case that x = b2 and y = s1  r2. dene
[e, f ; ]  k(b2, s1) by e = f = b2  c, and (x, z) = (x, xz) for x  s1  b2. it then
turns out that [e, f ; ] is a generator of k(b2, s1) = z. this is our rst instance of the
abs construction which will be described in section 2.8. as another example, consider
the complex projective spaces x = cp 2 and y = cp 1. as mentioned before, a non-

trivial generator of ek(s2) = z is given by the canonical line bundle over cp 1 which is the
restriction of the canonical line bundle over cp 2. it follows that the map k(x)  k(y )
is surjective. furthermore, k1(s2) = 0 and k(x, y ) = ek(s4) = z. from (2.54) we then

obtain the split short exact sequence

0  ek(s4)  k(cp 2)  k(cp 1)  0 ,

giving k(cp 2) = ek(s4)  k(cp 1) = z  z  z.

2.7 computing the k-groups

(2.62)

in this subsection we will show how the k-groups can be computed as homotopy groups
of certain classifying spaces, for which there is often a nite dimensional approximation.

23

the basic case is the reduced k-groups ek(x), since unreduced k-groups are computed
from the decomposition (2.16) and since higher k-groups are given by suspensions as in
(2.21). let vectk(x) be the set of isomorphism classes of complex vector bundles ek  x
of rank k. then we have the sequence of inclusions, . . .  vectk(x)  vectk+1(x)  . . .,
via the mapping ek 7 ek  i 1. if [ek]  vectk(x), then [ek]  [i k]  ker rk = k(x).
the map [ek] 7 [ek]  [i k] is actually an isomorphism vect(x)  k(x) of abelian
monoids, and hence vect(x) s

a complex vector bundle ek of rank k has structure group gl(k, c) (the ber auto-
morphism group), which upon choosing a metric on x, and thereby inducing a hermitian
inner product on the bers of ek, is reducible to the unitary subgroup u(k). the classi-
fying space for ek is the complex grassmannian manifold:

k=0 vectk(x) is an abelian group.

gr(k, m; c) =

u(m)

u(m  k)  u(k)

, m > k + n ,

(2.63)

where n  dim x. according to a standard theorem of dierential geometry, there exists a
so-called universal bundle q(k, m; c) over gr(k, m; c) of rank k whose pullbacks generate
vector bundles such as ek. this means that f q(k, m; c) = ek for some continuous map
f : x  gr(k, m; c), m > k + n. moreover, this isomorphism depends only on the
homotopy class of f . therefore, bundles ek are classied according to homotopy classes
in [x, gr(k, m; c)].

again, we have natural inclusions . . .  gr(k, m; c)  gr(k, m + 1; c)  . . ., and thus

taking the inductive limit we arrive at the classifying space for u(k) bundles:

bu(k) 

[m=k+n+1

gr(k, m; c)

vectk(x) =hx , bu(k)i

k(x) = vect(x) =hx , bu()i ,

(2.64)

(2.65)

(2.66)

such that

and

with bu() =s

(according to (2.18)) with h 0(x, z) = [x, z]. this implies that

k=1 bu(k). note that if x is compact, then k(x) = h 0(x, z) k(x)
k(x) =hx , zi hx , bu()i =hx , z  bu()i .

(2.67)

it turns out, however, that things simplify somewhat as the rank k is increased. this
leads to the notion of stable range. let k0 = [(n + 1)/2]. then for all k > k0 there exists a
bundle fk0 of rank k0 such that ek = fk0  i kk0. this means that any vector bundle ek
in the stable range is stably equivalent to some other bundle fk0 of lower rank k0. then

24

ek and fk0 belong to the same stable equivalence class and correspond to exactly the same
element of k(x), i.e. as far as k-theory is concerned, nothing is gained by considering
bundles of very high rank, because once the stable range is reached no new k-theory

elements are obtained by increasing the rank k. notice that, in the stable range, two
vector bundles of the same rank are stably equivalent if and only if they are isomorphic.
this implies that for all k > 1
2n, k(x) = vectk(x), or k(x) = [x, bu(k)]. therefore,
whenever x is connected, we have

ek(x) =hx , bu(k)i .

let us consider some simple examples. the case of immediate interest is where x =

sn, for which ek(x) = [sn, bu(k)] = n(bu(k)) for all k > n/2. we may cover sn
with upper and lower hemispheres sn
 are contractible, all bundles ek|sn
are trivial and hence determined by the single u(k)-valued transition function g on the
 = sn1, so g determines a map from sn1 to u(k), i.e.
overlap sn
an element of n1(u(k)). it is this element of n1(u(k)) which determines the bundle

. since the sn

. but sn

+  sn

+  sn

(2.68)



(2.69)

(2.70)

ek  vect(sn), and hence an element of ek(sn), so that
ek(sn) = n1(cid:16)u()(cid:17) ,

ek(sn) = n1(cid:16)u(k)(cid:17) ,

in particular, we have

k > n/2 .

where u() =s

k=1 u(k). the homotopy groups of classical lie groups such as u(k) have
been extensively studied. although n1(u(k)) is not known for all n, k, it is precisely
in the stable range k > n/2 that we have a complete classication. note that by (2.68),
eq. (2.69) is actually the assertion that [sn, bu(k)] = [sn1, u(k)]. this follows from the
following facts. first of all,

hsn , bu(k)i =hsn1 , bu(k)i =hsn1 , bu(k)i ,

(2.71)

where ny denotes the n-th iterated loop space of the topological space y . the isomor-
phism [sn1, u(k)] = [sn1, bu(k)] now follows from the fact that the space bu(k)
is of the same homotopy type as u(k). this means that the loop space operand  may

be thought of as a type of homotopic inverse to the classifying space operand b. it is
precisely this statement which was the original content of the bott periodicity theorem

for the classical lie groups [56].

as another example, take x = bn and y = sn1 = bn in rn. the topological coset
+/sn1 =

bn/sn1 can be identied with sn, which induces a homeomorphism from sn
bn/sn1 to sn. it then follows from the excision theorem that

k(bn, sn1) = k(bn/sn1, pt) = ek(sn) = n1(cid:16)u()(cid:17) .

for example, k(b2, s1) = 1(u()) = 1(u(1)) = z.

(2.72)

2.8 cliord algebras and the atiyah-bott-shapiro construc-

tion

in this subsection we will discuss the relation of cliord algebras and spinor representa-
tions to k-theory. the analysis of cliord algebras is very simple and many k-theoretic

results become transparent when translated into this algebraic language. let us start
by describing the cliord algebra cr,s associated with the vector space v = rr+s and
the quadratic form q(x) = x2
r+s on v , which is invariant
under o(r, s)-rotations. there is a natural embedding v  cr,s, and the abstract unital
algebra cr,s is generated by any q-orthonormal basis 1, . . . , r+s of v subject to the
relations

r+1  . . .  x2

1 + . . . + x2

r  x2

(2.73)

ij + ji = ( 2ij

,
,

i  r
i > r

the minimal representation of the algebra (2.73) consists of dirac matrices of dimension
2[ r+s
cr,s. since 2 = id, this leads to the decomposition

2 ]. the reection map x 7 x for x  v extends to an automorphism  : cr,s 

cr,s = c+

r,s  c
r,s ,

where c

r,s = {  cr,s : () = } are the eigenspaces of . it follows that

c

r,s  c

r,s  c
r,s ,

(2.74)

(2.75)

where ,  = . the associated graded algebra of cr,s is then naturally isomorphic
to the exterior algebra v , i.e. cliord multiplication dened by (2.73) is a natural
enhancement of exterior multiplication which is determined by the quadratic form q. in

fact, there is a canonical vector space isomorphism v  cr,s, and hence the natural
embeddings nv  cr,s for all n  0.

the spin group spin(r, s)  cr,s, of dimension 2r+s, is obtained from the group of
multiplicative units of the cliord algebra through the embedding sr+s1  v  cr,s.
it is a double cover of the group so(r, s), as is expressed by the exact sequence:

1  z2  spin(r, s)  so(r, s)  1

(2.76)

the spin group associated to cn,0 is spin(n) which is a double cover of the isometry
group so(n) of the sphere sn1. we will use the short-hand notation cn  cn,0 and
c
n  c0,n. as a simple example, c1 is generated by the unit element and an element
 obeying 2 = 1, so that c1 = c. similarly it is easily seen that c

1 = r  r.

under the canonical isomorphism cn = rn, cliord multiplication has a partic-
ularly nice form. for x  rn, we dene the interior product x : prn  p1rn

26

by

pxm=1

(1)m+1

nxi=1

xi(xm)i x1      xm1  xm+1      xp .

x (x1      xp) =
this denes a skew-derivation of the algebra since x (y) = (x )y+(1)p(x y)
for all   prn and all y  qrn. furthermore, (x)2 = 0 for all x  rn, so that the
interior product extends universally to a bilinear map rn  rn  rn. it is now
elementary to show that the cliord multiplication between x  rn and   cn can be
written as

(2.77)

x   = x    x  ,
with respect to the canonical isomorphism cn = rn.

(2.78)

for any pair of positive integers (r, s) there is an explicit presentation of the algebra
cr,s as a matrix algebra over one of the elds r, c or h. the rst few examples are easy
to construct by hand, for example

c1,0 = c

c2,0 = h

,

,

c0,1 = r  r
c0,2 = r(2)

c1,1 = r(2) ,

(2.79)

where f(m) denotes the r-algebra of m m matrices with entries in the algebraic eld f.
the complete classication of cliord algebras is then obtained by using the periodicity
relations (valid for any n, r, s  0):

and

where

cn,0  c0,2 = c0,n+2 ,
c0,n  c2,0 = cn+2,0 ,
cr,s  c1,1 = cr+1,s+1 ,

cn,0  c8,0 = cn+8,0 ,
c0,n  c0,8 = c0,n+8 ,

c8,0 = c0,8 = r(16) .

(2.80)

(2.81)

(2.82)

(2.83)

(2.84)

(2.85)

using these relations and (2.79) it possible to write down the complete set of cliord
algebras cr,s which are summarized in table 1. from this table one observes some extra
intrinsic symmetries of the cliord algebras, for example

cr,s = cr4,s+4 ,

cr,s+1 = cs,r+1 ,

which can also be proven directly from the denition of cr,s.

we will now describe the complexied cliord algebras which are related to the k-
theory of complex vector bundles over spheres. the complexication of the real cliord
algebra cr,s is the c-algebra cr,s = cr,s r c, which can also be viewed as the cliord
algebra associated with the vector space cr+s and the complexication q  c of the
quadratic form q. since all non-degenerate quadratic forms over c are equivalent, we

have the sequence of isomorphisms

cn = cn,0 r c = cn1,1 r c =    = c0,n r c ,

(2.88)

which makes the classication of the complexied cliord algebras much simpler, since

it means that cr,s only depends on the sum of r and s: cr,s r c = cr+s. from this it
also follows that the periodicity of cn is

cn+2 = cn c c2 ,

(2.89)

where c2 = c(2). (we shall see that this periodicity is related to bott periodicity of
the complex k-theory of spheres). using these identities one can easily deduce the list of

complexied cliord algebras in table 2.

most of the important applications of cliord algebras come through a detailed under-

standing of their representations and, by restriction, of the representation theory of their
corresponding spin groups. such properties follow rather easily from the classication just

presented. for any algebraic eld f we dene an f-representation of the cliord algebra
to be a homomorphism  : c  endf(w ) into the endomorphism algebra of linear
transformations of a nite dimensional vector space w over f (here c could be either
cr,s or cn). in particular  satises the property () = ()  () for all ,   c.
in this way w becomes a cliord-module over f. for   c the action of () on w  w
is denoted by

()(w)    w

(2.90)

and is customarily refered to as cliord multiplication.

as shown above, the tensor products of irreducible representations of certain cliord

algebras gives another irreducible cliord module (see e.g. (2.83) and (2.89)). in general,
however, cn  cm is not a cliord algebra, and so to nd a multiplicative structure in

29

the representations of cliord algebras it is natural to consider a special class of cliord
modules. for this, we dene a z2-graded module w for cn as one with a decomposition
w = w +  w  such that

(2.91)

c

n  w   w  ,

where ,  = . an important grading comes from the chirality grading of the corre-
sponding spin groups. given a positively oriented, q-orthonormal basis i of the oriented
vector space v , we dene an oriented volume element c of cr,s by the chirality element

setting n = r + s, this volume element satises

c = 1    r+s .

n(n+1)

(c)2 = (1)
x c = (1)n1 c x , x  rn ,

2 +s ,

(2.92)

(2.93)

showing that for n odd, c lies in the center of cr,s, whereas for n even, ic = c (i).
therefore, when n is even there is a chirality grading induced by the 1 eigenspaces of c.
let us start by classifying the representations of the real cliord algebra cr,s. a real
representation of this algebra is constructed in the obvious way. a c-representation, on
the other hand, is constructed as follows. recall that a complex vector space is just a
real vector space w together with a real linear map j : w  w such that j 2 = id.
then, a complex representation of cr,s is a real representation  : cr,s  endr(w ) that
commutes with the complex structure:

()  j = j  () .

(2.94)

similarly one denes quaternionic representations of cr,s. by restriction the representa-
tions of the algebras cn give rise to important representations of the spin group. the
real spinor representation of spin(n) is dened as a homomorphism

n : spin(n)  glr(w ) ,

(2.95)

given by restricting an irreducible real representation cn  endr(w ) to spin(n)  cn.
it can be shown that when n 6= 0 (mod 4) the representation n is either irreducible or a
direct sum of two equivalent irreducible representations, and that the second possibility
occurs exactly when n  1 or 2 (mod 8). in the other cases there is a decomposition

4m = +

4m  

4m ,

(2.96)

4m = 1

where 
2 (1  c)4m are inequivalent irreducible representations of spin(4m).
the reality properties of these spinor modules are then easily deduced. the only real

30

spinor modules (or, more precisely, the only ones which are complexications of real
representations) are 8k1, 
8k+4, 8k+5 are the
restrictions of quaternionic cliord modules. the remaining modules 
8k+6 are
complex.

8k, while the representations 8k+3, 

8k+2, 

we can similarly classify the representations of the complexied cliord algebra cn.

we dene the complex representation of spin(n) to be the homomorphism

c
n : spin(n)  glc(w ) ,

(2.97)

given by restricting an irreducible complex representation cn  endc(w ) to spin(n) 
cn. similarly to the real case, it is possible to show that when n is odd the representation
c

n is irreducible, whereas when n is even there is a decomposition

c

2m = c+

2m  c
2m ,

(2.98)

2m = 1

with c
2(1  im c)c
representations of spin(n).

2m, into a direct sum of two inequivalent irreducible complex

we nally come to the connection with k-theory, via the classic atiyah-bott-shapiro

(abs) construction [57] which relates the grothendieck groups of cliord modules to
the k-theory of spheres. for this we will use the denition introduced in section 2.6 of
the relative k-group k(x, y ) as the group of equivalence classes [e, f ; ], where  is an

isomorphism of the vector bundles e and f when restricted to y . let r[spin(n)] be the
complex representation ring of spin(n), i.e. the grothendieck group constructed from

the abelian monoid generated by the irreducible complex representations, with respect to
the direct sum and tensor product of spin(n)-modules. (we will describe representation
rings in more generality in section 6.1). let w = w +  w  be a z2-graded module over
the cliord algebra cn. we then associate to the graded module w the element

(w ) = [e+, e; ]  k(bn, sn1) ,

(2.99)

where e  bn w  is the trivial product bundle, and  : e+  e is the isomorphism
over sn1 given by cliord multiplication:

(x, w)  (x, x  w) , x  sn1 .

(2.100)

note that, since the ball bn is contractible, all bundles over it are trivial and the topology
all lies in the winding of the homotopically non-trivial map  : e+  e over sn1. it
is now straightforward to show that the element (w ) depends only on the isomorphism
class of the graded module w , and furthermore that the map w 7 (w ) is an additive
homomorphism. thus the map (2.99) gives a homomorphism

 : rhspin(n)i  k(bn, sn1) .

31

(2.101)

by restriction, the natural inclusion i : rn  rn+1 induces an epimorphism i : r[spin(n+
1)]  r[spin(n)]. it then follows that the homomorphism (2.101) descends to a homo-
morphism n : r[spin(n)]/i r[spin(n + 1)]  k(bn, sn1), which turns out to be a
graded ring isomorphism [57]:

rhspin(n)i / i rhspin(n + 1)i  ek(sn)

(2.102)

the groups in (2.102) are isomorphic to z for n even, while they vanish when n is odd
according to the above classication of cliord modules. the isomorphism (2.102) is
generated by the principal spin(n) bundle over sn:

spin(n)  spin(n + 1)  sn .

(2.103)

this theorem also gives us explicit generators for ek(s2n) dened via representations of
cliord algebras. for example, let s = s+  s be the fundamental z2-graded represen-
tation space for c2n. there is an isomorphism r[spin(2n)] = zz with generators given
by s and its ip es, the same graded module with the factors interchanged (this corre-
ponds to a reversal of the orientation in r2n). the generator of i r[spin(2n + 1)] = zdiag
is then [s] + [es]. thus the group ek(s2n) = z is generated by the element

(2.104)

(n)
c = [s+,s; ] ,

where x : s+  s denotes cliord multiplication by x  r2n. denoting the gener-
ators of s by i, the inclusion r2n  c2n along with the denition (2.90) of cliord
multiplication shows that x can be represented via ordinary matrix multiplication by
x =pi xi i  r2n:

x(w) =  2nxi=1
moreover, from (2.78) it follows that the square of the isomorphism x is just multiplica-
tion by the norm of the vector x  r2n:

xi i! w , xi  r .

(2.105)

x  x(w) = |x|2 w .

(2.106)

note that the bott periodicity of spheres, ek(sn) = ek(sn+2), can now be derived from

the periodicity property (2.89) of complexied cliord algebras. furthermore, using the

structure of cliord modules it is straightforward to show using the cup product that

we will now begin describing the systematic applications of k-theory to the classication

of d-brane charges in superstring theory. we start in this section by considering the type
iib theory, for which the simplest analysis can be carried out. type ii superstrings are

oriented and therefore have chan-paton bundles with unitary structure groups. except
for the new ways of thinking about and constructing d-branes, the k-theory formalism

merely reproduces the known spectrum of stable brane charges. however, the analysis
we present in the following easily generalizes to more complicated situations where we
will see that k-theory makes genuinely new predictions, and it moreover provides a nice

consistency check that the mathematical formalism is indeed the correct one.

we will show in this section that the group k(x) classies d-branes in type iib
superstring theory on the spacetime manifold x [17]. more precisely, the rr-charge of
a type iib d-brane is measured by the k-theory class of its transverse space, so that

ek(sn) classies (9  n)-branes in type iib string theory on at r10, for example. the

corresponding k-groups are determined by homotopy theory as described in section 2.7:

taking the inductive limit one has

ek(sn) = n1(cid:16)u(k)(cid:17) ,

k > n/2 .

ek(sn) = n1(cid:16)u()(cid:17) ,

where u() = sk u(k) is the innite unitary group. bott periodicity states that the
corresponding homotopy groups n(u()) are periodic with period two:

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

or

n(cid:16)u()(cid:17) = n+2(cid:16)u()(cid:17) ,

ek(sn) = ek(sn+2) .

from this and the fact that ek(s0) = z, ek(s1) = 0 follows the complete classication of

d-branes in type iib superstring theory, which is summarized in table 3. this table just

reects the fact that the type iib theory has stable dp-branes only for p odd. in this
way one recovers the usual spectrum of iib bps brane charges.

33

3.1 the brane-antibrane system

the physics behind the k-theory description of d-brane charges hinges on a new in-

terpretation of branes in terms of higher-dimensional branes and antibranes. we shall
therefore start by briey reviewing the properties of brane-antibrane pairs in superstring

theory. this system is unstable due to the presence of a tachyonic mode in the open
string excitations that start on the brane (respectively antibrane) and end on the an-

tibrane (respectively brane) [14]. the simplest way to see this property is by appealing to
the boundary state formalism (see [58] and references therein). a stable supersymmetric
dp-brane can be represented and described by a boundary state

|dpi = |dpins  |dpir ,

(3.5)

which is a particular coherent state in the hilbert space of the closed string theory. it
represents a source for the closed string modes emitted by a dp-brane. the boundary
state (3.5) consists of a part |dpins which is a source for the closed string states of the
ns-ns sector of the fundamental string worldsheet, and a piece |dpir for the rr sector.
the relative sign in (3.5) distinguishes a brane from its antibrane which have opposite rr

charges. taking into account the closed string gso projection gives the decompositions

|dpins = 1
|dpir = 1

2(cid:16)|dp, +ins  |dp,ins(cid:17) ,
2(cid:16)|dp, +ir + |dp,ir(cid:17) ,

(3.6)

where the  label the two possible implementations of the boundary conditions appro-
priate for a dp-brane. the decompositions (3.6) take into account the sum over the four
spin structures on the string worldsheet.

the boundary state formalism allows one to easily compute the spectrum of open
strings which begin and end on a dp-brane. this can be found by computing a tree-level

two-point function of the boundary state with itself (the cylinder amplitude) and via a
modular transformation re-expressing the result as a one-loop trace over open string states

(the annulus amplitude) according to

z0

z0

dt
t

tropen(cid:16)e2tl0(cid:17) ,

(3.7)

where vp is the (innite) worldvolume and ,  = . the open string sectors which
appear in (3.7) depend both on the closed string sectors and on the spin structures , .
of particular importance are the open string ns and ns(1)f even spin structures,
which correspond respectively to the closed string ns-ns and rr sectors with  = .
the ns sector is thereby gso projected in the usual way as ns-ns+rr=ns+ns(1)f .

34

this leads to the well-known fact that the sum over the contributions from all even spin

structures vanishes, and thus the spectrum of open strings which start and end on a
dp-brane is supersymmetric and free from tachyons.

however, if one considers instead a system composed of one dp-brane and one anti-
dp-brane (which we will also call a dp-brane), then the contribution to (3.7) from the

rr sector changes sign, and the ns open string sector has the wrong gso projection,
ns-ns  rr=nsns(1)f . the open string spectrum therefore exhibits a tachyon, and
this fact is responsible for the instability of the brane-antibrane pair. this feature is
a consequence of the fact that the system sits at the top of a potential well, and it is
precisely the presence of this tachyon eld in a p  p system that makes the connection
to k-theory.

we may choose a suitable basis of the open string chan-paton gauge group u(2) of
the brane-antibrane pair in which diagonal matrices represent the open string excitations
which start and end on the same brane or antibrane, while o-diagonal matrices represent

the string states which stretch between the brane and its antibrane of a given orientation.
the tachyon vertex operators which create the appropriate p  p tachyonic open string
states are therefore given by

vt (z) = eikax a(z)   0 1
vt (z) = eikax a(z)   0 0

0 0 ! ,
1 0 ! ,

(3.8)

where x a(z) are worldsheet boson elds and ka is the momentum along the dp-brane
worldvolume. from the structure of the chan-paton matrices in (3.8), it is straightforward

to see that the only non-vanishing correlation functions are those involving an equal
number of t and t  vertex operators. if t (x) and t (x) denote the complex tachyon
elds living on the worldvolume of the dp-brane anti-dp-brane system, then there is a
tachyon potential of the form

v (t t ) =

xn=2

cn(cid:16)t t (cid:17)n

.

this implies that the tachyon potential depends only on the modulus of t ,

v (t ) = v (|t|2) .

(3.9)

(3.10)

the presence of a non-trivial tachyon potential v (t ) implies that a stable conguration
cannot be reached by simply superimposing a dp-brane and a dp-brane, since the system

is sitting on top of a tachyon well. the lowest energy conguration (i.e.
the stable
conguration) of the system is obtained by allowing the tachyon to roll down to the

35

minimum t0 of its potential. from (3.10) it follows that these points live on a circle
described by the equation

note that in terms of the real tachyon eld t = t + t , the tachyon potential is an even
function of t,

|t| = t0 .

(3.11)

v (t) = v (t) ,

(3.12)

and the corresponding minima always come in pairs  t0.

furthermore, one may argue that, when the tachyon condenses into one of its vacuum
expectation values, the negative potential energy density of the condensate cancels exactly
with the positive energy density associated with the tension of the p  p pair:

2tp + v (t0) = 0 ,

(3.13)

where tp is the p-brane tension. this shows that the tachyon ground state is indistinguish-
able from the supersymmetric vacuum conguration, since it carries neither any charge
nor any energy. thus, under these circumstances, the stable conguration of a brane-

antibrane pair which is reached by tachyon condensation is nothing but the vacuum state.
however, instead of considering the tachyon ground state, one can also construct tachyonic
soliton solutions on the brane-antibrane worldvolume. this will be done in the next sub-

section, where we will see that one of the astonishing features of the k-theory formalism
is that is provides a very explicit form for the classical tachyonic soliton eld t (x).

the reversal of the gso projection described above may be formalised as follows. the
endpoints of the open string excitations of the p p pair carry a charge which takes values
in a two-dimensional quantum hilbert space. the rst component of such a wavefunction
may be regarded as bosonic and representing, say, the open strings which end on the

p-brane, while the second component is fermionic and represents the open strings which
end on the p-brane. the p  p open strings have o-diagonal chan-paton wavefunctions
which are odd under the adjoint action of the operator

(1)f = 3 =  1

0

0 1 ! ,

and are thereby removed by the gso projection operator

pgso = 1

2(cid:16)1 + (1)f(cid:17) .

(3.14)

(3.15)

on the other hand, the p p and p p open strings have diagonal chan-paton wavefunc-
tions. they are even under (1)f and are therefore selected by the gso projection (3.15).
having one bosonic and one fermionic chan-paton state leads to a pp worldvolume gauge
symmetry with gauge supergroup u(1|1). however, because of the gso projection, the

36

o-diagonal fermionic gauge elds of u(1|1) are absent, leading to the usual elimination
of the massless vector multiplet. the remaining bosonic elds on the p  p worldvolume
form instead a structure whose lowest modes correspond to the superconnection [59]

a =  a+

t  a ! ,

t

(3.16)

on x, where a are the gauge elds on the bundles e and f of the bosonic and fermionic
chan-paton states of the p-brane and p-brane, respectively. the p  p tachyon eld t is
regarded as a map t : e  f , while its adjoint t  is a map t  : f  e. alternatively, t
may be regarded as a section of e  f  and t  of e  f , where e = homc(e, c) is the
dual vector bundle to e. the superconnection (3.16) has been used recently in [60] for
a generalization, to the brane-antibrane system, of the usual wess-zumino couplings of

rr elds to worldvolume gauge elds (see also [61]). it will play a crucial role in section
7 when we discuss index theory.

3.2 the bound state construction

we will now discuss how to construct tachyonic soliton solutions and show that this con-

struction is equivalent to the abs homomorphism which maps classes in k(y ) to classes
in k(x), where the d-branes wrap around a submanifold y of the spacetime x. until

section 7 we shall deal only with at spacetimes and topologically trivial worldvolume em-
beddings y  x. we will start by constructing a stable p-brane in type iib superstring
theory as the bound state of a (p + 2)-brane and a coincident (p + 2)-brane. for this,
we shall consider an innite (p + 2) brane-antibrane pair stretching over a submanifold
rp+3  x. due to the tachyon, this system tends to annihilate itself unless there is some
topological obstruction. this obstruction is measured by the k-theory group k(x).

i + ia

on the (p+2)(p + 2) pair, there is a u(1)u(1) gauge eld (a+, a) and a tachyon
eld t of corresponding charges (1,1). this means that the kinetic energy term for the
tachyon eld in the worldvolume eld theory is of the form |(i  ia+
i )t|2. we
consider a vortex in which t vanishes on a codimension two submanifold rp+1  rp+3,
which we interpret as the p-brane worldvolume. we suppose that |t (x)| approaches its
vacuum expectation value t0 at |x|   (up to a gauge transformation). t is a complex
scalar eld, so it can have a winding number around the codimension 2 locus where it
vanishes, or equivalently at |x| = . the basic case is where the winding number is 1,
and t breaks the u(1)  u(1) gauge symmetry of the brane-antibrane pair down to the
diagonal u(1) subgroup. to keep the energy per unit p-brane worldvolume nite (i.e. to
have nite tension), there is a unit of magnetic ux in the broken u(1) group, which is
achieved by giving the gauge eld a+a on the worldvolume of the (p+2)(p + 2) pair

37

a unit of topological charge at innity. the non-vanishing asymptotic eld conguration

therefore takes the form

t  t0 ei

, a+

  a

  1

for r   ,

(3.17)

where (r, ) are polar coordinates on the two-dimensional transverse space rp+3  rp+1.
then both the kinetic and potential energy terms in the worldvolume eld theory vanish
suciently fast as r  , leading to a static nite energy vortex conguration for the
tachyon eld. this system has one unit of p-brane charge, but its (p + 2)-brane charge

is zero between the brane and antibrane. with t approaching its vacuum expectation
value everywhere except close to the core rp+1 of the vortex, the system looks like the
vacuum everywhere except very close to the locus where t vanishes. this soliton thereby
describes a stable, nite energy p-brane in type iib string theory. by studying the

boundary conformal eld theory describing this solution, one can prove that this soliton
is indistinguishable from the dp-brane of type iib superstring theory and is simply a

dierent representation of the same topological defect in the spacetime x.

one can easily generalize this construction to a (p+2k) brane-antibrane pair for k > 1.

first we construct a p-brane from a (p + 2) brane-antibrane pair, then we construct the
(p + 2) brane and antibrane each as a bound state of a (p + 4) brane-antibrane pair,
and so on. after k  2 more steps, we get a p-brane built from 2k1 pairs of (p + 2k)-
branes and antibranes. however, such a stepwise bound state construction breaks the
manifest spacetime symmetries and limits the possible applications of this formalism. a

more direct construction exhibiting the full symmetries of the system is desired. this is
precisely where the formalism of k-theory plays a central role.

to relate these constructions to k-theory, we recall from section 1 that the d-brane
charges of tadpole anomaly cancelling type iib 99-brane congurations are classied by
the reduced k-theory group ek(x) of the spacetime x. each class in ek(x) is represented
by an equal number n of 9-branes and 9-branes wrapping x, with the class in k(x) given
by the dierence [e][f ] of the chan-paton gauge bundles on the 9-branes and 9-branes.
open strings ending on all possible pairs of these branes give rise to a u(n)u(n) gauge
eld, and a tachyon eld t in the bifundamental nn representation of the gauge group.
although we dont know the precise form of the tachyon potential, we may argue that
at the minima |t| = t0 all eigenvalues of t0 are equal. this follows from the possibility
of separating the brane-antibrane pairs. it then follows that the tachyon condensate t0
breaks the worldvolume gauge symmetry from u(n) u(n) down to the diagonal u(n)
subgroup.

we will now construct a stable d-brane of the type iib theory as a bound state of
a system of n 9-branes and n 9-branes which locally near y resembles a topologically

38

stable vortex of the tachyon eld. the number n will be xed below by the mathematics
of the abs construction. the stable values of t0 (i.e. the gauge orbits of the tachyon
eld with minimum energy) live in the vacuum manifold

viib(n) =

u(n)  u(n)

u(n)diag

= u(n) .

(3.18)

therefore, when viewed as a higgs eld in this description, t supports stable topological

defects in codimension 2k which are classied by the non-trivial homotopy groups of the
vacuum manifold:

2k1(cid:16)viib(n)(cid:17) = 2k1(cid:16)u(n)(cid:17) = z , n > k .

(3.19)

so for a p-brane wrapping a submanifold rp+1  x, we take t (x) to vanish in codimension
2k = 9  p, and let it approach its vacuum orbit at |x|  , with a non-zero topological
twist around the locus rp+1 on which it vanishes, and of a given winding number at
innity. these congurations are classied topologically by the homotopy classes of maps
s2k1  u(n), or by the k-theory classes

ek(s2k) = 2k1(cid:16)u(n)(cid:17) = z ,

n > k .

(3.20)

note that d-brane charges are labelled by reduced k-groups of the transverse spaces to

the worldvolumes (compactied by adding a point at innity). this result makes manifest
the relation between homotopy theory (i.e. the classication of topological defects) and

k-theory (i.e. the classication of congurations of spacetime-lling branes up to pair
creation and annihilation). as discussed in the previous subsection, the negative energy

density corresponding to the vacuum condensate of t is equal in magnitude to the positive
energy density due to the non-zero tension of the 9  9 brane system wrapping x. this
implies that the total energy density away from the core of the bound state approaches zero

rapidly, and the conguration is very close to the supersymmetric vacuum. therefore,
tachyon condensation leaves behind an object wrapped on y = rp+1 that carries the
charge of a supersymmetric dp-brane wrapping y .

the embedding k(y )  k(x) is realized mathematically by the k-theoretic abs
construction that was described in section 2.8. (this is an example of a push-forward
map that we will return to in section 7). it corresponds to the mapping of a non-trivial

class describing a d-brane wrapping y into a class where it corresponds to the bound
state of a 9-brane 9-brane conguration wrapping the spacetime x. for y of codimen-
sion 2k in x, this construction selects the prefered value n = 2k1 of the number of
9  9-brane pairs (recall that this was precisely the prediction of the previous stepwise
construction), and it moreover gives a particularly simple, natural and useful representa-
tion of the tachyon vortex conguration (i.e. of the generator of 2k1(u(n))) via cliord

39

multiplication. consider the rotation group so(2k) of the transverse space, which is the
group of orientation-preserving automorphisms of the normal bundle of y  x. it has
two inequivalent positive and negative chirality complex spinor representations c
2k of
dimension 2k1. they give rise to two spin bundles s  y , which can be extended
to a neighbourhood of y in x (modulo some global obstructions, as we will describe in
section 7). they therefore dene a k-theory class [s+]  [s]  ek(x), where e = s+ is
the chan-paton bundle carried by the 9-branes and f = s by the 9-branes in the above
bound state construction.

the gauge symmetry of the 9-brane worldvolume x is u(2k1)  u(2k1), and the
2k  c
tachyon eld is a map t : s+  s. let 1, . . . , 2k be the generators of c+
2k ,
which can be regarded as maps s+  s  s+  s. let (x1, . . . , x2k)  s2k1 
r2k. then, using the construction of section 2.8, we dene the tachyon eld via cliord
multiplication

t (x) = f (x) x = f (x)

i xi ,

(3.21)

where f (x) is a convergence factor with the asymptotic behaviours

2kxi=1

f (x) = const.

f (x) =

(3.22)

which ensures that far away from the core of the vortex, t (x) takes values in the iib
vacuum manifold (3.18), whereas the tachyonic soliton is located on the submanifold xi =
0, i = 1, . . . , 2k. in the sequel we shall usually not write such convergence factors explicitly.
the eld t (x) has winding number 1 [62], and according to the abs construction, it
generates 2k1(u(2k1)) = z, or equivalently k(b2k, s2k1) = z. the precise mapping
k(y )  k(x) of k-theory classes is given by the cup product (2.60):

 : ek(y ) z k(b2k, s2k1)
h(e , f )i

 k(y  b2k, y  s2k1)
7 h(e  s+  f  s , e  s  f  s+)i

(3.23)

where [(e, f )]  ek(y ) and we have used the fact that k(sm) for any m is a free abelian

group.

one can verify that this all at once construction is equivalent to the previous step-

wise construction. this fact follows from the periodicity property (2.89) of the complexi-
ed cliord algebras, or equivalently from bott periodicity of complex k-theory. namely,

the process of tachyon condensation of the bound state of a p-brane p-brane pair into
a p  2-brane may be regarded as the bott periodicity isomorphism on the spacetime
k-theory group ek(x)  ek(x), which can in turn be described by the abs map

and i will always denote the standard su(2) pauli spin matrices. alternatively, as
shown at the end of section 2.5, the p  2-brane may be identied with a dirac magnetic
monopole vortex [55] in the pp-brane worldvolume. this identication is consistent with
the topological stability 1(u(1)) = z of the worldvolume soliton. moreover, it identies
the explicit form of the gauge eld conguration in the worldvolume eld theory as [63]

a

sin 

(3.27)

where (, ) are angular coordinates on the transverse space s2, and the brane-antibrane
indices  now label the corresponding upper and lower hemispheres s2
.

thus, the p-brane charge of the above conguration equals one, while all higher and

lower dimensional charges vanish (this can also be veried by using formulas for brane
charges induced by gauge elds). notice that t : e  f is trivial at innity (where
the system resembles the vacuum), and is an isomorphism e = f in a neighbourhood
of innity. this means that the k-theory class [(e, f )] is assumed to be equivalent to
the vacuum at innity, i.e. that one can relax to the vacuum by tachyon condensation

at innity. thus the rr charge of an excitation of a given supersymmetric vacuum
conguration is best measured by subtracting from its k-theory class the k-theory class

of the vacuum. the rr charge of an excitation of the vacuum therefore takes values in
k-theory with compact support.

4 type iia d-branes and k1(x)

in this section we will show that d-brane charges in type iia superstring theory are
classied by the higher k-group k1(x) [17, 18]. again we shall simply reproduce the
well-known spectrum of the type iia theory, but we shall gain many new insights into the
constructions of d-branes as well as the interrelationships between branes in the type ii

theories. furthermore, we shall uncover some remarkable applications of the bound state
construction.

41

4.1 the group k1(x)

there are a number of equivalent denitions of k1(x), each of which are useful in
dierent situations. the 11-dimensional m-theory denition was given in sections 2.4

and 2.5. in this denition, the higher k-group k1(x) is the subgroup of ek(xs1) which

classies rr charges in type iia string theory on the ten-dimensional spacetime x. it is
therefore tempting to interpret the s1 here as the compactication circle used in relating
11-dimensional m-theory and ten-dimensional type iia superstring theory. however,
there are no spacetime-lling m-branes, i.e. no known 10-branes, and also no hierarchy
of branes in m-theory. so at present it is unclear how to interpret the eleven-dimensional

extension of x required to classify d-brane charges of type iia string theory. it is for
these physical reasons that alternative formulations of the group k1(x) are desired.

the string theory denition of k1(x), i.e. with no reference to an 11-dimensional
extension of x, is similar to the denition of relative k-theory introduced in section 2.6
and can be given as follows. let e  vect(x) and let  : e  e be an automorphism of
the vector bundle e. two pairs (e, ) and (f, ) are called isomorphic if there exists an
isomorphism of vector bundles h : e  f such that the following diagram commutes:

e

 

e

h f
 
h f

(4.1)

i.e.   h = h  . dene the sum of two pairs (e, ) and (f, ) by (e  f,   ). a
pair (e, ) is called elementary if  is homotopic to ide within the automorphisms of e.
two pairs (e, ) and (f, ) are equivalent, (e, )  (f, ), if there exists two elementary
pairs (g, ) and (h, ) such that

(e  g,   ) = (f  h,   ) .

(4.2)

the set of equivalence classes of pairs [(e, )] denes an abelian group, which is precisely
k1(x). the inverse of a class [(e, )] is [(e, )] = [(e, 1)]. to prove this, we need
to show that (e  e,   1) is an elementary pair, where we may write
1 0 ! .

0 1 ! =  0 

  1 =  

0 !  0

(4.5)

with (0) = idee and (1) coinciding with (4.4). it follows that (4.4) is homotopic to
idee within automorphisms of e  e, and hence so is   1. more generally, it can
be shown that [(e, )] + [(e, )] = [(e,   )] = [(e,   )]. note that the analogous
statement for relative k-theory in section 2.6 can be proven in a similar way.

to show that this abelian group is indeed k1(x), we need only prove that two
automorphisms ,  determine the same class in k1(x), i.e.
[(e, )] = [(f, )], if and
only if there exists a vector bundle g  vect(x) such that idf idg and ideidg
are homotopic within the automorphisms of e  f  g. for this, we rst demonstrate
that [(e, )] = 0 if and only if there exists a vector bundle g  vect(x) such that idg
is homotopic to ideg within the automorphisms of e  g. indeed, if [(e, )] = 0 then
there exists elementary pairs (g, ) and (g, ) and an isomorphism h : e  g  g
such that the diagram

e  g h g
 
 
e  g h g

(4.6)

is commutative. thus   idg is homotopic to    = h1    h. this, in turn, is
homotopic to h1  idg  h = ideg, which proves the assertion. the converse statement
is obvious. going back to the original assertion, we consider two classes with [(e, )] =
[(f, )]. then, [(e, )] [(f, )] = [(e  f,  1)] = 0 and, as just argued, there exists
a vector bundle g such that   1  idg is homotopic to idef g. by composing this
homotopy equivalence with ide    idg one sees that   idf  idg and ide    idg
are homotopic. the converse statement is again obvious.

this string theory denition of k1(x), as well as its properties described above,
generalize to give the higher grothendieck group k1(c) associated to any category c
which is an abelian monoid. our third and nal denition of k1(x) is one that relates
the m-theory and string theory denitions, thereby showing their precise equivalence.

going back again to the denition of k1(x) as a subgroup of ek(x  s1), we identify
(e, ) with (e, eide ), where e is the vector bundle over s1x with total space [0, 1]e
modulo the identication (0, v)  (1, (v)) for all v  e.

to relate k1(x) = k(x) to homotopy theory, we use the observation stated after

eq. (2.71) in section 2.7. it follows that there is a natural isomorphism

k1(x) =hx , u()i ,

43

(4.7)

k=1 u(k) is the innite unitary group. in particular, it is possible to

and where k > n denes the stable range for k1(x).

4.2 unstable 9-branes in type iia string theory

to describe supersymmetric p-branes of the type iia theory as elements of a k-theory
group of the spacetime x, we have to resort to looking at bound states of unstable 9-
if we relax the usual requirements that d-branes preserve half of the original
branes.

supersymmetries and that they carry one unit of the corresponding rr charge, then
type iia p-branes with p odd are allowed and in particular we have spacetime-lling

9-branes. these states are non-supersymmetric unstable excitations in the superstring
theory, as there is always a tachyon in the spectrum of open strings connecting a 9-

brane to itself. thus the 9-branes of type iia are highly unstable, and we expect that
they should rapidly decay to the supersymmetric vacuum by tachyon condensation on

the spacetime-lling worldvolume (there are no rr elds in the corresponding type iia
supergravity that would couple to any such conserved charges). but as before, the unstable
d-brane congurations can carry lower-dimensional d-brane charges, so that when the

tachyon rolls down to the minimum of its potential and the state decays, it leaves behind
a supersymmetric state that diers from the vacuum by a lower-dimensional d-brane

charge,i.e. the state decays into a supersymmetric d-brane conguration and one can
represent a supersymmetric d-brane state as the bound state of the original system of

unstable branes. note that a representation in terms of bound states of 8-branes and
8-branes is possible using the constructions of the previous section. however, such a

construction is undesirable, as it breaks some of the manifest spacetime symmetries (in
the choice of an 8-brane worldvolume submanifold of x), and it limits the kinematics of
branes that can be studied in this way. we shall therefore present a string theoretical

construction that keeps all spacetime symmetries manifest.

the d9-brane boundary state |d9i, as a coherent state in the type iia closed string

hilbert space, is of the form

|d9i = |d9, +ins  |d9,ins ,

(4.10)

where |d9,ins are the two possible implementations of neumann boundary conditions

44

on all spacetime coordinates of x. since

(1)fl,r|d9,ir = |d9,ir ,

(4.11)

no combination of the states |d9,ir is invariant under the type iia gso projection
operator 1
4(1  (1)fl)(1 + (1)fr) and hence there is no rr component in the d9-
brane boundary state. but this just means that there is no rr tadpole, and thus no
spacetime anomalies related to rr tadpoles can arise for the iia 9-branes, i.e. unlike the
type iib case, where the number of 9-branes must equal the number of 9-branes, there

is no restriction on the number of type iia 9-branes. moreover, the 9-branes carry no
conserved charge, and there is no distinction between 9-branes and 9-branes in iia.

there is no gso projection in the open string channel of the torus amplitude hd9|d9i
and therefore, in the ns sector, the open strings connecting a 9-brane to itself will con-
tain both the u(1) gauge eld a that a supersymmetric d-brane would contain, and the
tachyon eld t which would be otherwise eliminated by the gso projection for super-

symmetric branes. furthermore, in the ramond sector of the open string both spacetime
chiralities ,  of the ground state spinors are retained. we can generalize this construc-
tion to the case of n coincident 9-branes. then the free open string spectrum of massless
and tachyonic states gives rise to the following low-energy eld content on the spacetime-
lling worldvolume: a u(n) gauge eld a, a tachyon eld t in the adjoint representation
of u(n), and two chiral fermion elds ,  of opposite spacetime chirality in the adjoint
representation of u(n). this can be compared with the type iib case, where n pairs of
9-branes and 9-branes give rise to a spectrum consisting of a u(n)  u(n) gauge eld
and a tachyon eld in the bifundamental representation of u(n)  u(n).

note that the case n = 1 is degenerate and will be dealt with separately later on
in section 4.4. notice also that the eld content on n 9-branes of type iia superstring

theory coincides with the ten-dimensional decomposition of an 11-dimensional system,
with am = (a, t ) an 11-dimensional u(n) gauge eld, and  = (, ) a 32-component
spinor eld in the adjoint representation of u(n). this indicates a hidden 11-dimensional
symmetry of the lowest lying open string states. it hints at a possible connection to m-
theory which is in agreement with the properties of the k-group k1(x) described in the
previous subsection.

consider the congurations of n 9-branes in type iia superstring theory up to possi-
ble creation and annihilation of 9-branes to and from the vacuum. an elementary 9-brane

conguration is one which rapidly decays to the supersymmetric vacuum, and therefore
does not contain any lower-dimensional d-brane charges. any elementary conguration
of n  9-branes wrapping the spacetime x gives rise to a u(n ) bundle f , together with
a u(n ) gauge eld a on f and a tachyon eld t in the adjoint representation of u(n ).

45

the presence or absence of lower d-brane charges is thereby measured by the tachyon
condensate t0. thus, as before, we assume that a bundle e with tachyon eld t can be
deformed by processes involving only creation and annihilation of 9-branes into a bun-
dle isomorphic to e  f where f is the chan-paton bundle of an elementary 9-brane
conguration.

we therefore consider the set of equivalence classes of 9-branes with tachyon conden-
sate, up to creation and annihilation of elementary 9-brane congurations to and from the
vacuum. a 9-brane conguration thereby denes an element [(e, )]  k1(x) where e
is the rank-n chan-paton bundle carried by the system of n unstable type iia 9-branes.
we will see in the following that the automorphism  is given by

 =  exp(i t ) ,

(4.12)

and it acts by the natural adjoint action (conjugation) on e. here t is the adjoint u(n)
tachyon eld on the 9-brane worldvolume. the possible 9-brane congurations up to
creation and annihilation of elementary 9-branes are therefore classied by k1(x). it is

cancellation requiring that the number of 9-branes equals the number of 9-branes (here
the integer in z is in general the dierence between the number of 9-branes and the

instructive to compare this to the situation in type iib, where k(x) = z  ek(x) and
d-brane charges are classied by the reduced k-theory group ek(x) with tadpole anomaly
in the type iia theory, we have ek1(x) = k1(x), with no

number of 9-branes).
tadpole restriction on the number of iia 9-branes. also, as previously computed, we have

ek(s2n) = z ,

ek(s2n+1) = 0

k1(s2n+1) = z , k1(s2n) = 0 .

(4.13)

this represents the fact that type iib contains supersymmetric p-branes for p odd, while
type iia has supersymmetric p-branes for p even. note that in this language, bott
periodicity is the statement that there are only two type ii superstring theories.

4.3 the bound state construction

we shall now present an explicit bound state construction of p-branes with worldvolume
y of odd codimension in the spacetime x as bound states of unstable type iia 9-branes.
this will show that k1(x) indeed does classify d-brane charges in type iia superstring
theory. this bound state construction is simply the analog of the abs construction, now

mapping classes in ek(y ) to classes in k1(x) in k-theory. this shows that whatever can

be done with stable lower-dimensional branes can be done with unstable 9-branes of the
type iia theory.

46

consider a system of n unstable 9-branes. the gauge group is u(n) and the tachyon
eld lives in the adjoint representation n  n of u(n) with tachyon potential v (t ) =
v (t ). if we assume that t condenses into one of its vacuum expectation values t = t0,
and that the negative energy density associated with the condensate cancels the posi-
tive energy density associated with the 9-brane tension, as in (3.13), then the system
of 9-branes completely annihilates into the supersymmetric vacuum and is therefore an

elementary conguration. in general, t has the tendency to roll down to the minimum of
its potential v (t ) and break part of the u(n) gauge symmetry. the precise symmetry
breaking pattern depends on the structure of the eigenvalues of t0, i.e. on the precise
form of the tachyon potential. for example, consider the symmetric tachyon potential

v (t ) = m2 tr t 2 + 2 tr t 4 + . . . ,

(4.14)

which is anticipated from the structure of the disc amplitudes at tree-level in open string
perturbation theory. in this case, t0 = tv  diag(1,1, . . . ,1) after diagonalization.
corrections to (4.14) from worldsheets with more than one boundary give terms of the
form

(4.15)
it can be shown that if 2  0 and 2 > 0, then the minimum t0 of the tachyon potential
still has only two distinct eigenvalues  tv.

+ . . .

v (t ) = 2htr t 2i2

we will henceforth assume that the 9-brane system under consideration has tachyon
condensate t0 with the same number of positive and negative eigenvalues. the number
of 9-branes is therefore 2n, and the gauge group u(2n) is broken down to u(n) u(n).
the type iia vacuum manifold is thus

viia(2n) =

u(2n)

u(n)  u(n)

,

(4.16)

and it parametrizes the stable vortex-like congurations of the tachyon eld. away from
the core of such a stable vortex (at |x|  ), the tachyon eld approaches its vacuum
expectation values. this denes a map sm  viia(2n), where the sphere sm asymptot-
ically surrounds the core of a stable vortex of codimension m + 1 in the spacetime x.

therefore, the stable tachyon vortices are parametrized by classes in

k1(sm+1) = m(cid:16)viia(2n)(cid:17) =( z

0

, m = 2k
, m = 2k + 1

(4.17)

from this we see that the type iia system exhibits stable bound states in odd codimension
2k + 1. note that the type iia vacuum manifold (4.16) of the tachyon eld on the 9-
branes is a nite-dimensional approximation to the classifying space bu() for complex
vector bundles over x.

47

we shall now explicitly construct the bound state tachyon vortices, which we will

interpret as supersymmetric d(2p)-branes of the type iia theory. as before, k-theory
selects a prefered natural value for the number 2n of 9-branes used to build the bound

state (and is the same number that would arise in a stepwise construction). namely,
bound states in codimension 2k + 1 are most eciently described by 2n = 2k 9-branes.
then the stable tachyon vortices are classied topologically by the homotopy groups

2k(cid:16)viia(2k)(cid:17) = z .

(4.18)

again we can explicitly construct the classical tachyon soliton eld corresponding to the
generator of this homotopy group. the spacetime-lling worldvolume of 2k 9-branes
supports a u(2k) chan-paton bundle, which we identify as the spinor bundle s of the
group so(2k + 1) of rotations in the transverse space whose spinor representation of
dimension 2k is irreducible. the tachyon eld is then given by

t (x) =

i xi ,

2k+1xi=1

(4.19)

where i are the dirac matrices of so(2k+1) and xi are local coordinates in the transverse
space. the tachyon eld is a map t : s  s and it asymptotically takes values in the
type iia vacuum manifold (4.16). this should be contrasted with the type iib case,
where the tachyon eld asymptotically took values in the iib vacuum manifold (3.18),
because of the dierent structure of the cliord algebra representations corresponding to

the rotation groups so(2k) and so(2k + 1).

in the present case we can go even further, and construct explicitly the non-trivial
u(2k) gauge eld conguration that lives on the 9-branes and must accompany the tachyon
vortex above due to the nite energy conditions imposed on the system as a whole. there

is a natural map

dened by the transformation of tachyon generators

2k1(cid:16)u(2k1)(cid:17)  2k(cid:16)v1(2k)(cid:17) ,

(4.20)

tiib(x) =

2kxi=1

i xi

7 tiia(x) = tiib(x) + x2k+1 3  i2k1 .

(4.21)

+  s2k

here tiib(x) is the iib tachyon eld, and it is constructed as the unbroken part of the
non-trivial u(2k) gauge eld. decomposing the sphere as before as s2k = s2k
+  s2k
 ,
with s2k1 = s2k
 are topologically trivial and can be patched
together to give a global gauge eld, with the appropriate magnetic charge on s2k, using
the transition function on the equator s2k1. this large gauge transformation is just
tiib(x), and the unbroken long-ranged gauge eld of u(2k1)  u(2k1) corresponds to
that of a generalized magnetic monopole.

 , gauge elds on s2k

48

using t 2

iia = |x|2, it is possible to show [62, 18] that the bundle automorphism (4.12)
is actually the generator of the homotopy group 2k+1(u(2k)), and that far away from the
core of the vortex, tiia(x)  viia(2k). this induces the natural map

2k(cid:16)viia(2k)(cid:17)  2k+1(cid:16)u(2k)(cid:17) ,

dened by

tiia 7  =  exp(i tiia) .

(4.22)

(4.23)

thus the tachyon condensate represents the generator of the relative k-theory group
k1(b2k+1, s2k) = z, and the above bound state construction is precisely the analog of

the abs construction, now mapping classes in ek(y )  k1(x) for y of odd codimension

in the spacetime manifold x wrapped by the unstable 9-branes of the type iia theory.

again the precise embedding is given by the cup product (2.60) as

b : ek(y ) z k1(b2k+1, s2k)
h(e , f )i

 k1(y  b2k+1, y  s2k)
7 bh(cid:16)(e  s)ide  , (f  s)idf (cid:17)i

(4.24)

for [(e, f )]  ek(y ).

in this way we get a hierarchy of bound state constructions in iia and iib, represented
by brane systems of increasing dimensions which support worldvolume gauge groups that

form a natural hierarchy

u(1)  u(1)  u(1)  u(2)  u(2)  u(2)  u(4)  u(4)  u(4)     .
this property leads to the usual descent relations among d-branes [11, 19].

(4.25)

in this

hierarchy, the bound state construction in terms of pairs of stable branes alternates with
the bound state construction in terms of unstable branes. it shows that a supersymmetric

dp-brane of type ii superstring theory can be constructed as the tachyonic kink in the
worldvolume of an unstable d(p + 1)-brane (see the next subsection), or alternatively as

a bound state vortex in a (p + 2)-brane (p + 2)-brane pair, or yet as a bound state of
two unstable (p + 3)-branes, and so on. this procedure continues until one reaches the
spacetime lling dimension, thereby ending up with a construction in terms of 9-branes

in which all spacetime symmetries are manifest.

as a simple example, consider the case of codimension 2k +1 = 3. the k-theory gauge
group is then u(2), acting on two unstable 9-branes whose chan-paton bundle in the 2
representation of u(2) is identied with the spinor bundle s of the rotation group so(3)
of the transverse space. using standard pauli spin matrices i for the dirac matrices of
so(3) gives

t (x) =

3xi=1

i xi =

x3

x1  ix2

x1 + ix2

(4.26)

the tachyon eld (4.26) represents a vortex of vorticity 1. the nite energy condition

ties it to the non-trivial u(2) gauge eld

sinh |x|! 3xj=1
|x|2 1  |x|

(4.27)

up to the trivial lift from su(2) to u(2) gauge theory this is nothing but the t hooft-
polyakov magnetic monopole in 3 + 1 dimensions [64], with the convergence factor in
(4.27) the usual bps solution of the t hooft-polyakov ansatz. this monopole represents

a supersymmetric stable d(2p)-brane of type iia superstring theory as a bound state of
two unstable d(2p + 3)-branes. alternatively, the diagonal block in (4.26) represents the

construction of one d(2p + 2)-brane and one d(2p + 2)-brane from a pair of d(2p + 3)-
branes (see the next subsection), while the o-diagonal block represents a d(2p)-brane as

the bound state of a d(2p + 2)-brane-antibrane pair (c.f. eq. (3.25)). again, this is an
example of the descent relations in type ii superstring theory [11, 19].

4.4 domain walls in type iia string theory

the case of codimension 1 (i.e. k = 0) is degenerate, as we shall now discuss. according
to the general prescription, this represents a stable 8-brane (or 8-brane) of the type iia
theory constructed as the tachyonic kink of 2k = 1 9-brane. the gauge group is u(1) and
the tachyon eld is a real scalar eld of charge 0 which is given by

t (x) =  t0 x9
q1 + (x9)2

,

(4.28)

since there is now only one -matrix which can be taken to be the 1  1 identity matrix.
here x9 is the coordinate transverse to the core of the kink which represents a domain
wall in spacetime. the sign in (4.28) distinguishes an 8-brane from an 8-brane and it
corresponds to the sign of the dierence t () t (+) between the asymptotic values
of the tachyon eld on the two sides of the domain wall. note that only one 8-brane or
8-brane may be constructed from one 9-brane. in this case there is no symmetry breaking

of the u(1) gauge group, and we are left with a u(1) gauge theory and a tachyon eld that
can condense into either one of the two vacuum expectation values  t0. the relevant
homotopy group of the vacuum manifold for one 9-brane is

0(cid:16)o(1)(cid:17) = 0(cid:16){ t0}(cid:17) = z2 ,

(4.29)

and so there is not enough room for the anticipated conserved 8-brane rr charge that
should be classied by z. therefore, each individual 8-brane and 8-brane requires its own

50

9-brane, and so the smallest 9-brane system that would accommodate the full k-theory
group k1(s1) = z of 8-brane charges has an innite number of spacetime lling branes.

more generally, if the tachyon potential is arranged so that the tachyon eld on the
worldvolume of n 9-branes condenses into its vacuum expectation value t0 with n  n
positive eigenvalues and n negative eigenvalues, then

t0 = tv  in n

0

0

in !

(4.30)

and the u(n) gauge symmetry is broken to u(n  n)  u(n). as in the n = 1 case, for
n > 1 the tachyon eld forms kinks of codimension 1. suppose that all eigenvalues of t
correspond to a kink localized at a common domain wall y of codimension 1 in x. then

locally near y we can write the tachyon eld as

t (x) =

tv x91+(x9)2
0

in n

0

 tv x91+(x9)2

in

 ,

(4.31)

which describes n  n 8-branes and n 8-branes with coinciding worldvolumes wrapping
y . more general congurations of separated 8-branes and 8-branes may be constructed
by letting each eigenvalue vanish along separate submanifolds of codimension 1 in the

spacetime x. again one cannot represent more than n 8-branes and 8-branes as a bound
state of n 9-branes, as one would have to do a k-theoretic stabilization by adding other

9-branes in order to keep the relevant homotopy groups in the stable range.

4.5 application to matrix theory

consider n d0-branes in type iia superstring theory on r10 (or some compactication
thereof). each d0-brane can be represented as a bound state of 16 unstable spacetime-

lling 9-branes, whose worldvolume eld theory contains a u(16) gauge eld, a tachyon
eld t in the adjoint representation of u(16), and two chiral fermion elds ,  of opposite
spacetime chirality in the adjoint representation of u(16). the tachyon eld near the core
of each stable point-like soliton can be represented as

t (x) =

i xi ,

9xi=1

(4.32)

where i are the dirac matrices of the so(9) group of rotations of the transverse space
to the core of the vortex. this eld generates the homotopy group

8(cid:16)viia(16)(cid:17) = z ,

viia(16) =

u(16)

u(8)  u(8)

.

(4.33)

51

moreover, the non-trivial long-ranged gauge eld gives rise to a magnetic charge of each

d0-brane, in addition to the unit vorticity from t (x).

the 16 9-branes live in the 16 representation of the u(16) gauge group, which, in the

background of the generalized magnetic monopole-vortex conguration representing the
d0-brane, is identied with the spinor 16 representation of so(9). (this generalizes the

three-dimensional t hooft-polyakov monopole, where the 3 representation of the su(2)
gauge group is identied with the spinor representation of the space rotation group so(3)).

k-theory implies that the stable string-theoretical soliton carries one unit of d0-brane
charge, and therefore represents a d0-brane as the bound state of 16 unstable 9-branes.
k-theory also implies that the trivial topology of the d0-brane worldlines in r10 does not
require stabilization of the conguration by adding extra 9-branes (this is true even in
compactications of r10). thus in this bound state construction, we never need to assume
that the worldline y is connected, and the spinor bundle s in this case is actually trivial
along y , and is thus extendable over x as the trivial bundle. in other words, we do not

need to introduce a new set of 16 9-branes for each additional d0-brane and therefore
any system of n d0-branes can be represented as bound states in a xed system of 16

unstable spacetime-lling 9-branes.

thus given a multi-d0-brane state described in terms of just 16 type iia 9-branes, we

can follow this 9-brane conguration as we take the usual sen-seiberg scaling limit that
denes matrix theory [65]. matrix theory can then be formulated as a theory of stable

solitons on the spacetime-lling worldvolume of 16 unstable 9-branes. this interpretation
of matrix theory, in terms of vortices in a gauge theory with xed gauge group, allows
one to change the number n of d0-branes in the system without changing the rank of

the gauge group. in the conventional formulation of matrix theory, whereby the large-n
limit requires relating theories with gauge groups of dierent ranks, it is very dicult

to understand how systems with dierent values of n are related (for instance by some
renormalization group approach). but the k-theoretic construction of d0-branes as mag-

netic vortices keeps the gauge group xed for arbitrary values of n. in summary, the
dynamics of matrix theory appears to be contained in the physics of magnetic vortices

on the worldvolume of 16 unstable 9-branes, described at low energies by a u(16) gauge
theory.

5 type i d-branes and ko(x)

having used the type ii theories to become well-acquainted with the bound state con-

structions and the use of them to describe d-branes in terms of new solitonic objects, we
shall now start considering more complicated superstring theories in which the k-theory

52

formalism will make some unexpected predictions. in this section we shall deal with the

type i theory, and thereby make contact with the original constructions of non-bps states
in string theory. type i superstrings are unoriented and their supersymmetric vacuum

conguration has gauge group so(32) which requires there to be always 32 spacetime
lling branes in the vacuum state. the k-theory of the corresponding chan-paton gauge
bundles therefore requires a renement of what was described in section 2. it is precisely

this dierence that will lead to a much richer spectrum of d-brane charges in the type i
theory.

5.1 the group ko(x)

consider a system of n 9-branes and m 9-branes in type i superstring theory. tadpole
anomaly cancellation now requires that n  m = 32, and the branes support an so(n)
bundle e and the antibranes an so(m) bundle f . because of brane-antibrane creation
and annihilation, we identify pairs of bundles (e, f ) with (e  h, f  h) for any so(k)
bundle h. pairs (e, f ) with this equivalence relation dene the real k-group of the
spacetime x, ko(x). by replacing f with f  i 32, it follows that the congurations
of tadpole anomaly cancelling 9-branes and 9-branes are classied by the reduced real
k-theory group gko(x). furthermore, it follows from the bound state construction that

d-brane congurations of type i superstring theory are classied by ko(x) with compact

support [17].

almost everything we said about k(x) carries through for real k-theory. the impor-
tant change, however, is the relation to homotopy theory. namely, for k > n = dim x
(the stable range for ko(x)), we have

where bo(k) = sm>k+n gr(k, m; r) is the classifying space for real vector bundles with

structure group o(k), and the real grassmannian manifold is

gko(x) =hx , bo(k)i ,

(5.1)

gr(k, m; r) =

for x = sn we now have that

o(m)

o(m  k)  o(k)

, m > k + n .

(5.2)

gko(sn) = n(cid:16)bo(k)(cid:17) = n1(cid:16)o(k)(cid:17) ,

k > n ,

(5.3)

and this group classies (9  n)-brane charges in type i string theory on at r10. the
stable homotopy of the orthogonal groups is much dierent than that of the unitary
groups. for example,

0(cid:16)o(k)(cid:17) = z2

,

k  1

53

1(cid:16)o(k)(cid:17) = z2
2(cid:16)o(k)(cid:17) = 0
3(cid:16)o(k)(cid:17) = z

,

,

,

k  3
k  4
k  5 .

(5.4)

note that the identication of 9-brane congurations with ko(x) does not really require
brane-antibrane annihilation. this follows from the fact that as dim x = 10, so(32)
bundles on x are classied by n(so(32)) for n  9. these homotopy groups always lie
within the stable range, so that all so(32) bundles on x are automatically classied by
gko(x).
the bott periodicity theorem now states that the homotopy groups of o() are

periodic with period eight:

n(cid:16)o()(cid:17) = n+8(cid:16)o()(cid:17) ,

(5.5)

and there are accordingly eight higher-degree ko-groups, dened by using suspensions as
described in section 2.4, with

and as usual kon(x) = gko

(x) = gko

gko(sn) = gko(sn+8) .
(5.7)

(5.6)

the periodicity (5.7) can be derived from the abs construction for ko-theory. let
ro[spin(n)] be the real representation ring of the spin group spin(n), which is generated

by the irreducible real representations. then following section 2.8, there is a natural
homomorphism

which descends to a graded ring isomorphism

 : rohspin(n)i  ko(bn, sn1)

rohspin(n)i / i rohspin(n + 1)i  gko(sn) .

using the periodicity property (2.83) of real cliord algebras, eq. (5.7) is immediate.

the isomorphism (5.9) can also be used to show how extra z2-valued charges such
as those in (5.4) appear in the d-brane spectrum of the type i theory. for example,
consider the case n = 1 in (5.9). since c1 = c, the c1-modules are just complex
vector spaces, and the isomorphism ro[spin(1)]  z is generated by taking the complex
dimension. similarly, since c2 = h, the c2-modules are quaternionic vector spaces
and ro[spin(2)]  z comes from taking the quaternionic dimension. the map i :
ro[spin(2)]  ro[spin(1)] is realized by regarding a quaternionic vector space as a

complex vector space under restriction of scalars. this is just the map z  z given by
multiplication by 2, since the complex dimension is twice the quaternionic one. this leads
to gko(s1) = z/2z = z2. moreover, the generators of the right-hand side of (5.9) can
be conveniently represented in terms of spinor modules and cliord multiplication maps.
for example, if s = s+  s is the fundamental graded module for c4m, then

(4m)
r = [s+,s; ]

(5.10)

is a generator of the group gko(s4m) = z, where again x : s+  s denotes cliord
multiplication by x  r4m. using the cliord module structure and the cup product we
can again easily compute that

(5.11)

the new torsion ko-groups also modify various product relations that were described in
section 2. for instance, the kunneth formula (2.39) need not hold in general for spheres,
because ko(sn) is not necessarily freely generated. nevertheless, the analog of (2.35),
for example, follows using (2.34) to get

gko(x  s1) = gko

(5.12)

5.2 the bound state construction

we need only know the rst eight ko-groups to determine the complete spectrum of
(bps and non-bps) d-branes in type i superstring theory. this spectrum may be found
in table 4. the list contains the well-known stable bps d9-branes, d5-branes and d-
strings of the type i theory (of integer-valued charges). the d0-brane is the z2-charged
d-particle, which is stable but non-bps, originally discovered in [7]. the d8, d7 and

d(1)-branes are new predictions of k-theory [17] which imply that the spectrum of the
type i theory should contain new z2-charged stable, but non-bps, 8-branes, 7-branes
and instantons. this new spectrum of the type i theory has been computed in [39] using
the boundary state formalism, thus explicitly conrming the k-theory predictions. since

55

the d9, d5 and d1 branes all carry rr charge, they are described by boundary states of

the form

the other non-bps d-branes do not carry any rr charge, and so have boundary states

|dpi = |dpins  |dpir ,

p = 1, 5, 9

(5.13)

|dpi = |dpins ,

p = 1, 0, 7, 8 ,

(5.14)

and they are their own antibranes. note that the explicit boundary state descriptions of
the non-bps d-branes proves that all charges in table 4 are carried by spacetime defects

onto which open strings can attach.

the type i theory can be considered as the orientifold projection of type iib su-

perstring theory by the worldsheet parity operator  which reverses the orientation of
the fundamental string worldsheet. the action of the orientifold group  on chan-paton

bundles is anti-linear, i.e. e  e, where e = e is the conjugate bundle dened by

complex-conjugating the transition functions of e. thus only real bundles survive the
orientifold projection, leading to the ko-theory of real virtual bundles for type i systems.

for p = 1, 5, 9, the corresponding type iib rr charge is invariant under the -projection,
i.e. |dpir = |dpir. the associated type i bound state constructions are then just the
orientifold projections of the type iib ones. one can describe the non-bps branes in
terms of bound states of a single bps brane-antibrane pair of lowest possible dimension.

for p = 0, 8, there is no iib rr charge, and the boundary state is automatically even
under . the d0 (respectively d8) brane are topologically stable kinks in the tachyon
eld on the worldvolumes of type i d1d1 (respectively d9d9) systems, with z2-valued
wilson lines (c.f. section 4.4). for p = 1, 7,  exchanges iib p-branes with p-branes,
i.e. |dpir = |dpir, so that the p-brane-antibrane conguration is -invariant. thus
the type i d(1) (respectively d7) brane is the orientifold projection of the d(1)
d(1) (respectively d7d7) system in iib. in these latter two cases, we may write the
corresponding type i boundary states in terms of those of the iib theory as

|dpii = |dpiiib + |dpiiib = |dpins ,

p = 1, 7 .

(5.15)

one may then show that the type iib tachyon present in the unstable p  p state is
eliminated by the  orientifold projection [39], leading to a stable solitonic state. from

these bound state constructions one may also immediately deduce the worldvolume eld
theories of the non-bps d-branes, and in particular the worldvolume gauge groups listed

in table 5, as we will demonstrate explicitly in the following. in the remainder of this
section we shall describe some aspects of the d-brane spectrum of type i superstring

theory using its ko-theory structure. we will consider each type of soliton separately
and discuss the features unique to each dimensionality.

5.3 type i d-instantons

the perturbative symmetry group of the type i superstring should really be considered
as o(32), rather than so(32), because orthogonal transformations o with deto = 1
are symmetries of type i perturbation theory, i.e. the central element 1 of o(32) acts
trivially on the perturbative spectrum, so that the corresponding symmetry group is
o(32)/z2. this fact makes a connection with how the perturbative gauge group of the
type i superstring appears, which is locally isomorphic to so(32). however, s-duality
with the so(32) heterotic string implies that transformations o of determinant 1 are
actually not symmetries. this then implies that there must exist some non-perturbative
eect that breaks the group o(32) to its connected subgroup so(32), and this is pre-
cisely the z2-charged gauge instanton associated with 9(so(32)) = z2. this is proven
in [17] using index-theoretical arguments, namely the fact that a non-trivial bundle on
the sphere s10 is characterized by having an odd number of fermionic zero modes of the
corresponding chiral dirac operator (the relationship between index theory and k-theory

will be discussed in section 7.4). the type i d-instanton comes from a bound state of
type iib 9-brane-antibrane pairs with chan-paton bundles (s+,s), while the anti-d-
instanton has gauge bundles (s,s+). here s are the usual 16-dimensional complex
chiral spinor representations of so(10). the orientifold projection acts by complex con-
jugation, so it reverses the chiralities s+  s (equivalently the 9-branes and 9-branes)
and thereby identies the instanton and anti-instanton in the type i theory. for type i
superstrings and ko-theory, the gauge bundles must be real, and so we take the type i
9-brane chan-paton bundles to transform as the spinor module s = s+s which, by re-
garding complex representation vector spaces as real ones under restriction of the scalars,
becomes the unique irreducible, real 32-dimensional spinor representation of so(32). the
(1)-brane is therefore described by 32 9 9 brane pairs with chan-paton bundles (s,s)
and a tachyon eld t (x) =pi i xi.

5.4 type i d-particles

an element of ko(r9) (or gko(s9)) is described by a pair of trivial so(n) bundles (e, f )
over r9 with a bundle map t : e  f that is an isomorphism near innity and such that
the rotation group so(9) acts on the bers of e and f in the spinor representation. for

57

ko-theory, we must use real spinor representations, and for so(9) there is a unique such
irreducible representation s of dimension 16. thus e and f have rank 16 and transform
under so(9) rotations like s. the tachyon eld is then given by (4.32).

we can compare this k-theoretical construction to the original construction of the
type i d-particle in [9]. for this, we make an 8 + 1 dimensional split of the coordinates
and -matrices. pick an so(8) subgroup of so(9), and let x = (xa, x9) under this split,
with a = 1, . . . , 8. the spinor representation s of so(9) breaks up under this split into
so(8) as s = s+  s, with s the real eight-dimensional chiral spinor representations
of so(8). write the so(8) dirac matrices as a : s  s+ and (a) : s+  s. it
then follows from (4.32) that the tachyon eld decomposes as (see (4.21))

t (x) = 

x9 i16

pa(a) xa x9 i16 ! .
pa a xa
1  i16 =  0

i16

i16

0 !
x9 i16 pa(a) xa ! .

x9 i16

(5.16)

(5.17)

(5.18)

changing the basis of chan-paton factors on the 9-branes by the matrix

leads to

t (x) 7 (1  i16) t (x) (1  i16) =  pa a xa

the diagonal blocks here represent two decoupled systems each containing eight 9  9
pairs. the rst set of eight 9  9 pairs has tachyon eld

ts(xa) =

a xa ,

8xa=1

(5.19)

and the second one has (ts). but ts describes a d-string located at x1 = . . . = x8 = 0
(see section 5.6 below), and, since (ts) is made from ts by exchanging 9-branes with
9-branes, the tachyon eld (ts) describes an anti-d-string located at x1 = . . . = x8 = 0.
this is just the construction in [7] of the type i d-particle from a coincident d-string
and anti-d-string. the o-diagonal blocks correspond to a codimension one tachyon eld
which connects the d-string and anti-d-string and is odd under the reection x9  x9.
this is precisely the solitonic conguration of the d1d1 tachyon eld constructed in [9].

thus, the k-theory formalism can also be used to produce string theoretical constructions
of non-bps states.

the spinor quantum numbers carried by the d-particle also appear naturally in this
framework. as shown in [9], the type i 0-brane transforms in the spinor representation of

so(32), which agrees with the fact that the non-perturbative gauge group of the type i
superstring is really the spin cover spin(32)/z2 of so(32). in the above construction this

58

can be seen from the fact that the 9-brane chan-paton factors produce an so(32) vector

of fermionic zero modes, whose quantization gives a spinor representation of so(32) (again
one uses the index theoretical fact that a non-trivial so(32) bundle on s9 is characterized
by having an odd number of fermionic zero modes of the corresponding dirac operator)
[17]. furthermore, given n coincident type i 0-branes, the tachyon vertex operators have
the form (in the zero-picture)

v () =  eik0x0(z)   ,

(5.20)

where  is an n  n matrix which acts on the chan-paton factors and  is a worldsheet
fermion eld. the  projection maps   . thus, if  = , then v () is odd
under  and the tachyon state survives the -projection. an antisymmetric matrix 
always has an even number of non-zero eigenvalues, such that each pair describes the

ow toward annihilation of a pair of 0-branes. this means that the d-particle number

is conserved only modulo 2, in agreement with the fact that gko(s9) = z2. a similar

argument applies to the type i d-instantons.

5.5 domain walls in type i string theory

the type i d8-brane is described by gko(s1) = 0(o(32)) = z2, which is represented via
trivial bundles e, f  r1 and a tachyon eld t : e  f that is invertible at innity.
as in section 4.4, the 8-brane is a domain wall, located at x9 = 0, and constructed from
a single 9  9 pair with a tachyon eld (4.28) that is positive on one side and negative
on the other side of the wall. in contrast to the situation of section 4.4, however, the z2-
valued charges that arise here from the bound state construction are very natural. one
way to see this is by appealing to the bott periodicity map (5.7) which may be described

as follows. take [(e0, f0)]  gko(sn) with tachyon map t0 : e0  f0, and construct
[(e, f )]  gko(sn+8) by setting

e = e0  (s+  s)

,

f = f0  (s+  s) ,

(5.21)

where s are the chiral spinor representations of so(8) with dirac matrices a : s 
s+. let xa denote the last eight coordinates of rn+8. the tachyon eld is then given as
before by the cup product:

t (x) = 

t0  i16

id pa(a) xa

t0  i16 ! .
id pa a xa

(5.22)

for example, setting n = 1 we obtain the tachyon eld (5.16) with the diagonal matrix

representing 16 8-branes and 8-branes and the o-diagonal ones corresponding to the
bound state construction of a d-particle in terms of the 8 8 brane pairs. so the relation

59

(5.16) between the 8-brane and the 0-brane is a typical example of the bott periodicity

map in type i superstring theory.

alternatively, the bott periodicity isomorphism (5.6) of ko-groups comes from taking

n

(x) with the generator [nr] [i 8] of gko(s8) = z,
the cup product of an element of gko
where nr is the rank 8 hopf bundle over the real projective space rp 7 associated with the
real hopf bration s15  s7. this shows that the construction of a p-brane in terms of
p + 8-p + 8 brane pairs in type i superstring theory is determined by a d-string solitonic

conguration which gives an explicit physical realization of the spin(8) instanton. the
corresponding eight-dimensional non-trivial gauge connections, and the associated spinor
structures, may be found in [66]. this identies the explicit form of the worldvolume

gauge elds living on the p + 8-p + 8 brane pair, required to ensure that the tachyon
eld is covariantly constant near innity and hence to produce the nite energy solitonic

p-brane conguration, as [66]

a+

(1 + |x|2)2 ,

(5.23)

where ij are the generators of spin(8). these gauge eld congurations are spin(9) sym-
metric (thereby preserving the manifest spacetime symmetries) and carry unit topological
charge. similar arguments apply to the non-bps d7-brane.

5.6 type i d-strings

we will now exhibit the type i d-string as a bound state of 9-branes and 9-branes,
located at x1 = . . . = x8 = 0 in r10 with worldvolume coordinates (x0, x9). the group
of rotations keeping the d-string worldsheet xed is so(8), which rotates the vector
x = (x1, . . . , x8). the two spinor representations s of so(8) are both eight-dimensional,
with dirac matrices a : s+  s. thus we consider a conguration of eight 9-branes
and eight 9-branes with trivial gauge bundles, but with the rotation group so(8) acting
on the chan-paton bundles with the rank eight bundle of the 9-branes transforming as
s+ and of the 9-branes as s. the tachyon eld is then given by (5.19) and the map
x 7pa a xa/|x| is the generator of 7(so(8)) = z. as in section 4.5, there are no global

obstructions that occur in this bound state construction, since the type i spacetime

x is a spin-manifold and so is the orientable two-dimensional d-string worldsheet (a
global version of the bound state construction will be presented in section 7.3). there

is also no need to assume in the above construction that the d-string worldvolume is
connected. this implies that any collection of (disjoint) d-strings can be represented by
a conguration of eight 9  9 pairs and there is no need to introduce eight more pairs
for every d-string. this is in contrast to the type iib case, where the spacetime x

60

need not admit a spin structure and in general one would have to carry out a k-theoretic
stabilization by adding extra 9  9 pairs.

it is interesting to examine some of the gauge solitons we have described above in light
of the s-duality between the type i theory and spin(32)/z2 heterotic string theory. the
type i d-instanton, d-particle and d-string are all manifest in heterotic string perturba-

tion theory. the d-string is equivalent to the perturbative heterotic string [4], so that the
second quantized fock space of perturbative heterotic strings can be described completely
by congurations of eight 9  9 brane pairs. (note that similar conclusions as those of
section 4.5 can also be reached for heterotic matrix string theory.) the d-particle is a
gauge soliton in the spinor representation of so(32), just like some of the particles in the

elementary heterotic string spectrum. finally, the d-instanton gives a mechanism that
breaks the disconnected component of o(32), and this symmetry breaking is manifest in

heterotic string perturbation theory. thus, from the point of view of the heterotic string,
these three non-perturbative objects can be continuously connected to ordinary pertur-

bative objects. we note also that all of the above bound state constructions, like those
of the previous sections, preserve the manifest symmetries of the transverse spaces to the

d-branes. moreover, the extra 32 9-branes which must be added for anomaly cancellation
yields an so(32) gauge symmetry that plays no role in the above constructions. the
bound state construction uses extra brane-antibrane pairs to enlarge the gauge group, so

that so(32) invariance is manifest.

5.7 type i d5-branes and the group ksp(x)

the group ksp(x) classies type i d-branes which are quantized using symplectic gauge
bundles. the appearance of symplectic gauge symmetry can be understood from the

analysis of [67] (see also [37]) where the requirement of closure of the worldsheet operator
product expansion was shown to put stringent restrictions on the actions of discrete gauge
symmetries on chan-paton bundles. in particular, the square of the worldsheet parity

operator  acts on chan-paton indices as

2 :

a |dp; abi (cid:16)2
 (cid:17)b
(cid:17)a
|dp; abi 7 xa,b(cid:16)2

b

= (i)(9p)/2 |dp; abi

(5.24)

where a, b are the open string endpoint chan-paton labels of a dp-brane state of the iib
theory, and  denotes the adjoint representation of the orientifold group in the chan-
paton gauge group. while the 9-branes have the standard orthogonal subgroup projection
(as required by tadpole anomaly cancellation), eq. (5.24) shows that 2 = 1 when acting
on, for example, 5-branes (and also on the corresponding tachyon vertex operators [17]).

the 5-branes must therefore be quantized using pseudo-real gauge bundles, i.e. chan-
paton bundles with structure group sp(2n) on the 9-branes and 9-branes. an alternative

table 6: d-brane spectrum in type i string theory with symplectic gauge bundles.

explanation [17] uses the fact that a type i 5-brane is equivalent to an instanton on

the spacetime lling 9-branes that occupy the vacuum [68]. the tachyon eld breaks
the so(4n)  so(4n) gauge symmetry of the 9-9 brane conguration to the diagonal
subgroup so(4n)diag, which is then further broken down to sp(2n) by the instanton
eld. (note that for a conguration of unit 5-brane number one needs at least 4n = 4
spacetime lling brane-antibrane pairs). notice that eq. (5.24) also explains the standard

spectrum of stable bps d-branes in the type i theory, as well as the worldvolume gauge
groups listed in table 5.

for ksp(x) the connection with homotopy theory is given by

gksp(sn) = n1(cid:16)sp(k)(cid:17) ,

k > n/4 ,

(5.25)

where k > n/4 denes the stable range for ksp(x). as previously,

gksp(sn) = n1(cid:16)sp()(cid:17) ,
n(cid:16)sp()(cid:17) = n+4(cid:16)o()(cid:17) ,
gksp(sn) = gko(sn+4) .

(5.28)

where sp() = sk sp(k) is the innite symplectic group. in this case bott periodicity

takes the special form

so that

thus, any calculation in symplectic k-theory can be reduced to one in real k-theory.
the complete spectrum of corresponding brane charges can be found in table 6, which
shows that while the spectrum of supersymmetric d-branes remains unchanged, that of

the stable non-bps states diers from before. the isomorphism (5.28) comes from taking
the cup product with the class of the rank 2 instanton bundle nh associated with the
pseudo-real hopf bration s7  s4, i.e. the holomorphic vector bundle of rank 2 over
cp 3 [55]. thus the relationships between a bps p-brane and a bps p + 4-brane is a
5-brane soliton which may be identied with an su(2) yang-mills instanton eld. for
example, consider a type i d-string in the worldvolume of a 5  5 brane pair [7]. the
worldvolume gauge symmetry is so(4) = su(2)su(2) and the tachyon eld transforms
in its 22 representation. the -projection identies the vacuum manifold of the 5-brane

62

conguration as su(2) = sp(1). the topological stability of the d-string is guaranteed
by the homotopy group 3(su(2)) = z. a nite energy, static string-like solution in the
corresponding 5+1 dimensional worldvolume eld theory is possible when one imposes

the following asymptotic forms on the elds (analogously to (5.23)):

t  tv u

, a  0

,

a+  i du u 1 .

(5.29)

here u is an su(2) matrix-valued function corresponding to the identity map (of unit
winding number) from the asymptotic boundary s3, of the string-like conguration in
ve dimensions, to the su(2) group manifold s3. then the string soliton carries 1 unit
of instanton number (living on the 5-brane) which is known to be a source of d-string
charge in type i string theory [23, 68]. further applications of the k-theory of symplectic

gauge bundles will be discussed in section 6.

5.8 relationships between type i and type ii superstring the-

ory

the k-theory formalism has given us many dierent relations between d-branes in a given

superstring theory. it turns out that it also provides new relationships between the type
i and type ii theories, which we shall now proceed to briey describe. let us rst note

that the codimension 1 cases described in sections 4.4 and 5.5 are actually realizations
of the elementary hopf bration s1  s1 with discrete ber z2 [55]. an example of the
construction of a type i non-bps brane as a kink of brane-antibrane pairs is of course
the original construction [9] of the type i d-particle from a d-string anti-d-string pair.
the double cover of s1 corresponds to the pair of branes, and the winding number of the
tachyon eld is labelled by the homotopy group (4.29) of the ber corresponding to the
discrete gauge transformation t  t (so that the d-string carries a z2-valued wilson
line). the cup product with the generator  of ko(b1, s0) = z2 then achieves the desired
abs mapping of z2-valued ko-theory classes on ko(y )  ko(y  b1, y  s0).

generally, the hopf bration

sn1  s2n1  sn

(5.30)

is non-trivial only for n = 1, 2, 4, 8 when its ber sn1 is a parallelizable sphere [51, 53].
this topological fact is related to the algebraic property that there are only four normed
division algebras over the eld of real numbers, corresponding respectively to the reals,
the complex numbers, the quaternions and the octonions (or cayley numbers). in that

case, the classifying map of the bration, which determines the corresponding topological

63

soliton eld, is determined by the principal spin(n) bundle (2.103) and is a generator of

n1(cid:16)spin(n)(cid:17) / n1(cid:16)spin(n  1)(cid:17) = ( z2

z

,
,

n = 1
n = 2, 4, 8

(5.31)

as we have seen, the four hopf brations determine all the fundamental bound state con-
structions of d-branes in type i and type ii superstring theory, and hence the complete

spectrum of d-brane charges in these theories rests on the fact that there are only four
such brations. for n 6= 1, the topological charge of the corresponding soliton is given by
the pontryagin number density which is proportional to tr(f n/2), where f is the curvature
of the associated topologically non-trivial gauge eld conguration. for n = 1 the charge
is determined by a z2-valued wilson line, as in [7]. this feature determines string solitons
in terms of magnetic monopoles in the type ii theories, while in the type i theories we
obtain non-bps branes as kinks, bps branes as su(2) instantons, and both bps and

non-bps branes as spin(8) instantons. this topological property realizes all d-branes
in terms of more conventional solitons, and it moreover determines the explicit forms of

the non-trivial gauge elds living on the brane worldvolumes. therefore, all fundamental
d-brane constructions, and hence the complete spectrum of d-brane charges in type i

and type ii superstring theory, are quite naturally determined by the four non-trivial
hopf brations [19] which thereby provide a non-trivial link between the two types of
string theories.

some further connections can be deduced from the relationships that exists between

the dierent types of k-theories. given a complex vector bundle e, the correspondence
e 7 e induces an involution on the group k(x). furthermore, the realication and
complexication functors r and c on the categories of real and complex vector bundles

induce homomorphisms of the corresponding k-groups. the rst one associates to each
complex vector bundle its underlying real vector bundle, while the second one associates

to each real vector bundle e the complex vector bundle e r c = e  e. then there are

the natural homomorphisms between the k-groups of the type i and type iib theories

k(x) r

 ko(x) c

 k(x) .

(5.32)
note that the composition r c is multiplication by 2, while (c r)([e]) = [e  e]. for
example, consider the generator of ek(s4) = z, which is the pseudo-real su(2) instanton
bundle described above. to realize it as a generator of gko(s4) = z, which labels type
i 5-brane charge, it must be embedded in the orthogonal structure group as so(4) =
su(2)  su(2) to make it real. the embedding in so(4) doubles the charge, since the
natural map in (5.32) from ko(s4) to k(s4) is multiplication by 2, and so the rr charge
of a type i 5-brane is twice that of a type iib 5-brane. these facts may be viewed as
special instances of the natural periodicity isomorphisms [51]

kon(x, y ) z zh 1

2i = kon4(x, y ) z zh 1
2i ,

64

kn(x, y ) z zh 1

2i = (cid:16)kon(x, y )  kon2(x, y )(cid:17) z zh 1
2i ,

(5.33)

which can be proven using the cup product with the class of the su(2) instanton bundle.

more generally, the type i and type ii theories are related by the exact sequence

kon1(x, y ) c

 kn1(x, y )

r kon+1(x, y )  kon(x, y ) r

 kn(x, y )
(5.34)

where  : kn1(x, y )  kn+1(x, y ) is the bott periodicity isomorphism.

6 d-branes on orbifolds and orientifolds

in this section we will analyze the properties of d-branes in orbifolds and orientifolds

of the type ii and type i theories. as we shall see, the natural k-theoretic arena for
this classication is equivariant k-theory which takes into account of a group action on
the spacetime. equivariant k-theory is of enormous interest in mathematics because it

merges cohomology with group representation theory. it is therefore of central importance
to both topology and group theory. in the following we will see that it also leads to some

non-trivial aspects of the d-brane spectrum in these theories.

6.1 equivariant k-theory

consider type iib superstring theory on an orbifold x/g, where g is a nite group of
symmetries of x. in this subsection we will show that d-branes on x/g are classied by

the so-called g-equivariant k-theory group of x [69]. this group is dened as follows.
let x be a smooth manifold and g a group acting on x (in general g is either a nite

group or a compact lie group). in this situation we say that x is a g-manifold and write
the g-action gx  x as (g, x) 7 g x. a g-map f : x  y between two g-manifolds
is a smooth map which commutes with the action of g on x and y :

f (g  x) = g  f (x) .

(6.1)

in other words, f is g-equivariant. a g-bundle eg  x is a principal ber bundle e  x
with e a g-manifold and canonical ber projection  which is a g-map, i.e. (g  v) =
g  (v), for all v  e, g  g. a g-isomorphism eg  fg between g-bundles over x
is a map which is both a bundle isomorphism and a g-map. these conditions dene the
category of g-equivariant bundles over the g-space x. the corresponding grothendieck
group is called the g-equivariant k-theory kg(x), i.e. kg(x) consists of pairs of bundles
(e, f ) with g-action, modulo the equivalence relation (e, f )  (e  h, f  h) for any
g-bundle h over x.

65

d-brane congurations on x/g are understood as g-invariant congurations of d-

branes on x [37], i.e. the orbifold spacetime is regarded as a g-space. we assume that x
is endowed with an orientation and a spin structure, both of which are preserved by g.

given a d-brane conguration, i.e. a virtual bundle [(e, f )], we can assume that g acts
on (e, f ), since the gauge bundles can be constructed in a completely g-invariant way.
in tachyon condensation, we assume that a pair of bundles (h, h) can be created and

annihilated only if g acts on both copies of h in the same way (otherwise the requisite
tachyon eld would not be g-invariant). thus, we conclude that for type iib superstrings
on an orbifold x/g, d-brane charge takes values in kg(x). for type iia one similarly
has k1
g (x)  kg(x) = kg(s1  x)
with g acting trivially on the s1).

g (x) and for type i we get kog(x) (here k1

let vi denote the irreducible, nite-dimensional complex representation vector spaces
of the group g. as in section 2.8, the isomorphism classes [vi] of the additive category
of g-modules with respect to the direct sum of vector spaces, i.e. with [vi] + [vj ] =
[vi  vj ], generate an abelian monoid. the corresponding grothendieck group r(g) is
called the representation ring of the group g. according to the description of section
2.1, each element of r(g) can be expressed as a formal dierence [vi]  [vj ], where [vi]
and [vj ] are equivalence classes of nite-dimensional representations of g. thus we have
[vi]  [vj ] = [v 
i  vj . as
always, the tensor product of vector spaces vi  vj induces a commutative ring structure
on r(g). for example, let g = s1 and let ym denote the one-dimensional representation
dened by

j ] if and only if vi  v 

i ]  [v 

j is unitarily equivalent to v 

m() z = eim z ,

z  s1 ,

(6.2)

with   r. then it is easy to see that the representation ring of the compact group
s1 = u(1) is the ring of formal laurent polynomials in the variable y:

r(s1) = zhy, y1i .

(6.3)

the representation ring of the cyclic subgroup zn  s1 is the direct sum of n integer
groups:

r(zn) = zn ,

(6.4)

while the representation ring of the torus group tn = u(1)n is the ring of formal laurent
polynomials in n variables y1, . . . , yn:

r(tn) = zhy1, y2, . . . , yn, (y1y2    yn)1i .

(6.5)

generally, for any simply connected lie group g, r(g) is a polynomial ring over z with
rank(g) generators [70].

66

a more familiar description of r(g) is in terms of the space of characters of the group
g. the isomorphism class of the g-module vi is completely determined by its character
map vi : g  c dened by vi (g) = trvi (g). since the characters enjoy the properties
vi vj = vi + vj , vi vj = vi vj , and vi (hgh1) = vi (g), it follows that the map
vi 7 vi identies r(g) as a subring of the ring of g-invariant complex-valued functions
on g. we shall see that the representation ring correctly incorporates the structure of

the mirror brane charges induced by the action of g on x.

if g acts trivially on the spacetime x then

kg(x) = k(x)  r(g) ,

(6.6)

where k(x) is the ordinary k-group of x. this follows from the fact that, for trivial

g-actions, a g-bundle e may be decomposed as

e =mi

homg(ei, e)  ei ,

(6.7)

where ei = x  vi is the trivial bundle over x with ber vi. more generally, for any
compact g-space x, the collapsing map x  pt gives rise to an r(g)-module structure
on k#
g(x), such that r(g) is the coecient ring in equivariant k-theory (rather than
simply z as in the ordinary case). the kg-functor enjoys most of the properties of
the ordinary k-functor that we described in the previous sections.
in addition, kg is
functorial with respect to group homomorphisms. in this sense, kg(x) is a generalization
of the two important classication groups k(x) and r(g), so that equivariant k-theory

unies k-theory and group representation theory. in fact, the trivial space x = pt gives
kg(x) = r(g) while the trivial group g = id gives kg(x) = k(x). a useful excision
type computational feature is that if h is a closed subgroup of g, then for any h-space
x, the inclusion i : h  g induces an isomorphism i : kg(g h x)  kh(x).

if the group g acts freely on x (i.e. without xed points), then x/g is also a

topological space and its g-equivariant k-theory is just

kg(x) = k(x/g) .

(6.8)

however, in general x/g is not a topological space (let alone a smooth manifold) and the
g-equivariant cohomology is far more intricate. then, a useful theorem for computing

equivariant k-theory is the six-term exact sequence that was introduced in section 2.6:

g (x, y )  k1
k1
 
kg(y )  kg(x)  kg(x, y )

g (x)  k1
 

g (y )

67

(6.9)

where y is a closed g-subspace of a locally compact g-space x, and the relative k-
theory is dened by kn
g (x/y ) (when the quotient space makes sense).
the advantage of using this exact sequence is that one may take y to be the xed point

g (x, y ) = ekn

set of the group action on x, such that the quotient space x/y has a free g-action on
it and its equivariant cohomology can be computed as the ordinary cohomology of its
quotient by g, as in (6.8).

from now on, we will assume that g is a nite discrete group of symmetries of the

spacetime manifold x. away from any orbifold singularities of x/g, d-brane charge is
classied according to (6.6) which yields the usual type ii spectrum, taking into account
the mirror images connected by the g-action. therefore, we want to understand how

brane-antibrane pairs behave at the singular points. for this we need to know how the
orbifold projection is realized on the chan-paton factors. from the general theory of

d-branes in orbifold singularities it is known [67, 37] that the action of g on chan-paton
indices is given by

g  x () = x (g ) ,

(6.10)

where  is the chan-paton factor of a eld x and g is the representation of g  g
in the chan-paton gauge group. (an example is the action of the gso projection that
we described at the end of section 3.1). in particular, like a vector potential ai(x), the
tachyon eld transforms in the adjoint representation under the g-orbifold projection, i.e.
it is g-equivariant:

g :

t (x)

7 g t(cid:16)g1  x(cid:17) (g)1 .

(6.11)

in this way, the tachyon eld can be thought of as either a g-bundle map t : eg  fg,
or equivalently as a g-section of the g-bundle (e  f )g.

in considering brane charges in terms of 9  9 brane pairs on orbifold singularities,
considerations similar to earlier ones apply, but now including the mirror images induced
under the action of g, i.e. at an orbifold singularity, each brane pair has |g| mirror pairs.
the gauge elds from the vector multiplet of the worldvolume spectrum in x/g dene a
connection ai(x) of the corresponding chan-paton bundle. the gso projection cancels
tachyonic degrees of freedom leaving only the quiver structure of vector multiplets and
hypermultiplets [37]. however, when coincident branes and antibranes wrap a submanifold

y /g of the orbifold spacetime, the tachyon eld is still preserved by the gso projection
and the massless vector multiplet is projected out, i.e.
the g-action commutes with
the gso projection. the worldvolume eld theory of n branes wrapped on y  x is
described via chan-paton bundles e over y with structure groups qi u(nni ), where ni

is the dimension of the i-th regular representation of g. the vacuum conguration at
innity is re-expressed now in a g-equivariant way in terms of the characters of g. then

68

the resulting g-invariant vacuum may be reached by tachyon condensation, provided that

(6.11) holds. the bound state construction may now be carried out just as before. some
explicit constructions of d-branes on orbifolds using equivariant k-theory may be found

in [28].

however, it turns out that for suciently regular orbifolds, equivariant k-theory

does not really provide new information or new states that are not already described
according to ordinary cohomology theory or k-theory [29]. for instance, equivariant

bott periodicity ekg(sp+2) = ekg(sp) implies that ekg(s2k) = ekg(s0) = r(g), yielding
typically |g| copies of the usual rr charge. in the equivariant cases, the bott periodicity
theorems related dierent sets of |g| branes to each other, where |g| is the number of
mirror images in the orbifold. as an illustration, consider the z3 ads-orbifold for type
iib supergravity on ads5 s5 which is dual to the n = 1 superconformal eld theory on
its boundary that is an su(n)3 gauge theory on the worldvolume of n parallel d3-branes
placed at an orbifold singularity [71]. the supergravity horizon is the lens space

h = l2(3)  s5/z3 .

(6.12)

extended objects in the boundary theory are understood as type iib branes which wrap
cycles in h. the nontrivial homology groups of the horizon are

h1(h) = h3(h) = z3 ,

(6.13)

which correspond respectively to d3-branes and d5-branes wrapped on a one-cycle and a
three-cycle of h. however, there are also wrapped ns5-branes on the three-cycles, corre-
sponding to the discrete symmetry group (z3  z3) z3 of the boundary superconformal
eld theory. the k-group of the lens space h is [72]

k(h) = z3  z3 = h even(h, z) ,

(6.14)

where h even denotes the subring of elements of even degree in the ordinary cohomology
ring. thus the k-group correctly accounts for the d3-brane and d5-brane torsion charges,
but it is missing the non-commuting z3-valued charge of the ns5-brane. this is not at
all surprising, because topological k-theory always has an underlying commutative ring
structure, and it does not take into account the neveu-schwarz b-eld (equivalently the

s-duality symmetry of type iib superstring theory) [17]. for this particular orbifold
example, k-theory completely agrees with ordinary cohomology theory and does not sup-

ply us with new objects. this example lies in a particular class whereby the spacetime
manifold is birationally equivalent to a smooth toric variety for which the k-groups are

torsion-free and thus the chern character, to be discussed in section 7.1, yields an iso-
morphism with the corresponding cohomology ring [29]. in light of this feature, we will

now turn our attention to orientifolds, whereby the discrete geometrical action of g on
x is further accompanied by a worldsheet symmetry action on the superstring theory.

69

6.2 real k-theory

real kr-theory [73] is a generalized k-theory which merges complex k-theory, real ko-

theory (as well as quaternionic ksp-theory and self-conjugate ksc-theory) with equiv-
ariant k-theory. we will specialize the orbifold construction above to the case g = z2, so
that the space x is equipped with an involution, i.e. a homeomorphism  : x  x with
 2 = idx. in addition to the equivariant cohomology, we shall quotient by the action
of the worldsheet parity transformation .  reverses the orientation of a string, and
it induces an anti-linear involution on gauge bundles e over x that commutes with  .
in making the orientifold projection by  (in type iib string theory on x), we need to

retain k-theory classes that are in eect even under the projection by . since  acts
on 9-brane (and 9-brane) chan-paton bundles by complex conjugation, we consider an
induced anti-linear involution   : ex  e (x) acting on the bers of gauge bundles, with
( )2 = 1, that maps e to its complex conjugate bundle e. thus  (e) = e with isomor-
phism  :  (e)  e satisfying ( )2 = id. now we dene an equivalence relation on
the category of such vector bundles by (e, f )  (e  h, f  h) for any bundle h that is
similarly mapped by the involution   to its complex conjugate. the grothendieck group
of all virtual bundles with involutions on x is called the real k-group kr(x).

as usual, one denes higher groups krm(x) by

m

gkr

(x) = gkr(x  sm) ,

(6.15)

with the involution  on x extended to x  sm by a trivial action on sm. more generally,
one can extend the denition (6.15) to spheres on which  acts non-trivially. let rp,q be
the p + q dimensional real space in which an involution acts as a reection of the last q
coordinates, i.e. given (x, y)  rp  rq we have  : (x, y) 7 (x,y). let sp,q be the unit
sphere of dimension p + q  1 in rp,q with respect to the at euclidean metric on rp  rq.
with these denitions, we may dene a two-parameter set of higher degree kr-groups

according to

or by using the suspension isomorphism:

p,q

+ ) ,

(x) = gkr(x  rp,q
gkr
krp,q(x) = kr(x  rp,q) .

with these denitions we have

krn(x) = krn,0(x) .

bott periodicity in kr-theory takes the form

krp,q(x) = krp+1,q+1(x) ,
krm(x) = krm8(x) .

70

(6.16)

(6.17)

(6.18)

(6.19)

(6.20)

the relation (6.19) implies that krp,q(x) = krqp(x) so that krp,q(x) only depends
on the dierence p  q. the relation (6.20) then states that krp,q(x) depends only on
this dierence modulo 8. this implies that one can dene negative-dimensional spheres
as those with antipodal involutions in kr-theory, with sn,0 being identied as sn1 and
s0,n as sn1. note that if we identify r1,1 = c with the involution  acting by complex
conjugation, then the (1, 1) periodicity theorem (6.19) takes the particularly nice form

for any locally compact space x.

kr(x) = kr(x  c) ,

(6.21)

kr-theory is a generalization of k-theory and ko-theory because of the following

internal symmetries. if the involution  acts trivially on x, then

(6.22)

krm(x  s0,1) = km(x) ,
krm(x) = kom(x) .

(6.23)
the relation (6.22) follows from the fact that the space x  s0,1 can be identied with
the double cover x = x  x of x, with  acting by exchanging the two copies of x in
x. in particular, if x  denotes the set of xed points of the map  : x  x, then

krn(x  ) = kon(x  ) ,

(6.24)

because the involution  acts trivially on a xed point. there are many further such
internal symmetries in real k-theory, coming from the usage of negative dimensional

spheres. using the multiplication maps in the elds r, c and h, and (1,1) periodicity,
one may establish the isomorphisms [73]

kr(x  s0,p) = kr2p(x  s0,p) ,

(6.25)

for p = 1, 2 and 4, respectively. this isomorphism for p = 1 gives the complex bott

periodicity theorem, while the real periodicity theorem can be deduced from the case
p = 4. in fact, there is the usual natural isomorphism

krn(x  s0,p) = krn(x)  krp+1n(x) ,

(6.26)

for all p  3. the case p = 2, where there is no splitting into kr-groups of x, is special
and will be discussed in section 6.5. again, most of the properties discussed in section 2

have obvious counterparts in the real case. in particular, the product formulas derived
in section 2 can also be extended to kr-theory (as they did for ko-theory). for example,
by repeating the steps which led to (2.36) we may obtain, for a trivial action of  on x,

the product formula

(s1,1) = kr1+1(pt) = ko(pt) = z .

(6.28)

gkr

for x = sn the periodicity theorem (6.19) can also be deduced from the abs con-
struction for real k-theory. for this, we dene a two-parameter set of cliord algebras
c(rn,m) of the real space rn,m as the usual algebra associated with rn+m together with
an involution generated by the action of  on rn,m. a real module over c(rn,m) is then a
nite-dimensional representation together with a c-antilinear involution which preserves
the cliord multiplication. the corresponding representation ring r[spin(n, m)] is natu-
rally isomorphic to the grothendieck group generated by the irreducible r-modules n,m
of the cliord algebra of the space rn  rm with quadratic form of lorentzian signature
(n, m), as in section 2.8. the abs map is now the graded ring isomorphism [52, 73]

kr(rn,m) = rhspin(n, m)i / i rhspin(n + 1, m)i = konm(s0) ,

(6.29)

where in the last equality we have used the periodicity relations (6.17), (6.19) and (6.20).

this isomorphism relates the groups on the left-hand side of (6.29) to the cliord algebras
cn,m, so that the topological (1, 1) periodicity (6.19) follows from the algebraic (1, 1)
periodicity (2.82).

let us now discuss how real k-theory can be used to classify d-branes in -orientifolds.

generally, the xed point set of a g-action on x is a number of p + 1 dimensional planes
called orientifold p-planes, or op-planes for short. they determine the singular points

of the given orbifold. for the present orientifold group action, these objects are non-
dynamical but they share many of the properties of d-branes themselves. for instance,

they carry rr charge and have light open string states connecting them and the d-branes,
which enhances the gauge symmetry of coincident branes over an orientifold plane. hav-
ing a non-trivial gauge symmetry means that the supersymmetric vacuum state of these

theories must contain 32 dp-branes in order render the vacuum neutral (this is again
the requirement of tadpole anomaly cancellation). we want to determine the charges of
stable (but possibly non-bps) states localized over an orientifold plane of x/  g. note
that far away from the orientifold planes, we can think of the spacetime manifold x as
being represented by a double cover x  x with the orientifold group  g mapping the
two disconnected components of x into each other. using (6.22), we see that far away
from the op-planes the theory looks just like ordinary type ii superstring theory. we are
therefore interested only in what happens to states which are localized on the singular
op-planes.

from the periodicity relations (6.19) and (6.20), we may show quite generally that

kr(rdp,9d) = kr(r2dp1,0) ,

(6.30)

72

where we have identied the spacetime x with the real space rd+1(r9d/i9d), with
i9d the reection  acting on 9  d coordinates of the transverse space. the kr-group
(6.30) classies dp-brane charges localized over an orientifold d-plane. on the right-hand

side of (6.30) we have a real space with the kr-involution acting trivially, so that

kr(rdp,9d) = ko(s2dp1) .

(6.31)

setting d = 9 in (6.31) gives the usual group ko(s9p) that classies dp-brane charge in
ordinary type i superstring theory. setting d = 8 leads to

kr1(rdp1,1) = ko1(s15p) = ko(s8p) ,

(6.32)

giving a shift by one of the type i charge spectrum. in the next subsection it is shown
that the t -dual of the type i theory on a spacetime manifold x is classied by kr1(x),
in agreement with (6.32). in general, for a given dimensionality d of orientifold planes,

one may use (6.31) and table 4 with the appropriate period shift to read o the charges
of d-branes located over the d-planes. for example, for d = 5 we get the classication

of stable d-brane charges localized on an o5-plane. this spectrum resembles that of
type i string theory in that there is a z-charged d-string, a z2-charged gauge soliton,
and a z2-charged gauge instanton. this spectrum agrees perfectly with the bound state
construction of an orientifold p-brane in terms of type iib p-brane-antibrane pairs, and
the result (5.24) which shows that the tachyonic mode is removed by the -projection
only for p = 1, 7. a similar analysis can be carried out for type iia orientifolds.

a physical interpretation of the (1, 1) periodicity of kr-theory may also be given [19].
consider a p-brane of codimension n + m in a type ii orientifold by   im. the p-brane
charge is induced by the tachyon eld which is given by cliord multiplication on the
transverse space rn,m, i.e. t (x) = pi i xi where i are the generators of the spinor
module n,m, and which generates gkr(rn,m). under the abs isomorphism (6.29), this
kr-theory class is multiplied, via the cup product, by the hopf generator of gkr(cp 1) = z

(with its natural real structure induced by the antilinear complex conjugation involution),
or equivalently by the spin bundles which carry the spinor representation 1,1. this
gives a class with tachyon eld that generates the kr-group of the new transverse space
rn+1,m+1. this class represents a p  2-brane of the type ii orientifold by   im+1.
from this mathematical fact one deduces a new descent relation for type ii orientifold
theories, whereby a p  2-brane localized at an o(8  m)-plane in a type ii   im+1
orientifold is constructed as the tachyonic soliton of a bound state of a p-p pair located
on top of an o(9  m)-plane in a type ii   im orientifold. this realizes the branes of
a type ii orientifold as equivariant magnetic monopoles in the worldvolumes of brane-
antibrane pairs of an orientifold with xed point planes of one higher dimension. the

73

former orientifold has 2m o(8m)-planes each carrying rr charge 23m, while the latter
one has 2m+1 o(9m)-planes of charge 24m. in the process of tachyon condensation the
number of xed point planes is doubled while their charges are lowered by a factor of 2 via

a combined operation of charge transfer (via the equivariant monopole) and dimensional
reduction through the orientifold planes. an example is the non-bps state consisting
of a d5-brane on top of an orientifold 5-plane in the type iib theory [7], which may

be constructed via a tachyon condensate from a pair of d7-d7 branes on an orientifold
6-plane in the type iia theory. the 8 o6-planes each carrying charge 2 are transfered
to the 16 o5-planes of charge 1.

6.3 type i  d-branes and kr1(x)

type i  superstring theory is the t -dual of the type i theory, which may be obtained as
the orientifold of type iia string theory of the form x/  i1. this theory contains un-
stable spacetime-lling 9-branes, whose congurations up to creation and annihilation of
elementary 9-branes classify all d-brane charges. in terms of k-theory this corresponds to
the group kr1(x), or the group of equivalence classes [(e, )] where e is a real bundle
with an involution that commutes with the orientifold group and  is an automorphism of
e that also preserves the orientifold group action. in type i  string theory, e is identied
with the chan-paton bundle on the worldvolume of the spacetime-lling 9-branes. at the
orientifold planes, the gauge symmetry is reduced from u(n) to o(n). each individual

lower-dimensional brane is represented as a bound state of a certain number of unstable
type i  9-branes. the tachyon condensate is required to respect the z2 orientifold sym-
metry (as in (6.11)), corresponding to a z2-equivariant monopole. we will discuss this
latter property in more detail in the next subsection.

6.4 the bound state construction for type ii orientifolds

a t -duality transformation of the type i theory on an m-torus tm gives a type ii ori-
entifold on tm/  im. in this section we shall describe some aspects of these orientifold
theories using k-theoretic properties, thereby extending the discussion of the last subsec-

tion. in particular, we will demonstrate how the formalism allows one to naturally deduce
the complete set of vacuum manifolds for tachyon condensation in the t -dual theories of

the type i theory (see table 7), and hence the worldvolume eld contents of d-branes
in these models. (superstring compactications will be discussed in more generality in
section 7). the rich structure that now arises, in contrast to the two unique vacuum

manifolds (3.18) and (4.16) for tachyon condensation in the ordinary type ii theories, is
a consequence of the 8-fold periodicity of the ko- and kr-functors. in terms of iterated

table 7: type ii orientifold theories on spacetimes x = y  t1,m whose d-brane charges
are classied by the group krm(x). the general dual orbifold model in each case is
listed (column 5) along with the corresponding vacuum manifold for tachyon condensa-
tion in the worldvolume of 2[m/2]+1n spacetime lling 9-branes (column 4) whose stable
homotopy group coincides with krm(x). the second column lists the appropriate real
spinor module which is used to map each ko-theory class of the type i theory into the
corresponding kr-theory class of the orientifold. their dimensions (column 3) determine
the appropriate increase in the number of 9-branes needed for the bound state construction
as required by k-theoretic stabilization.

loop spaces, nbo(k) is of the same homotopy type as n+8bo(k), while mo(k) for
0  m  7 are of the same homotopy types as the loop spaces of the lie groups given
in the fourth column of table 7 [56]. the vacuum manifolds of the type ii orientifolds

are thereby very natural consequences of the homotopy properties of ko-theory. indeed,
the identication of these worldvolume gauge symmetries is a genuinely new prediction
made solely by k-theory. moreover, the periodicity of 8 is in agreement with the fact

that the cycle of distinguishing properties and dualities of type ii orientifolds starts over
again on the compactication torus t8. (a concise overview of the properties of type ii
orientifolds and their moduli spaces may be found in [74].) in the rest of this subsection
we shall give some physical interpretations to the appearence of these stable homotopy

properties. more details can be found in [19].

after a t -duality transformation on t1 = s1, the superstring theory is, as mentioned
in the last subsection, the type i  theory. the mapping between type i and type i 
is similar to the mapping in type ii superstring theory where t -duality maps type iib
(sl+1), from
which we identify the vacuum manifold in the second line of table 7. next, consider the

into type iia. the induced charge takes values in the higher ko-group gko

1

toroidal compactication of the type i theory which is t -dual to type iib superstring
theory on the t2/z2 orientifold. there are n 7-7 brane pairs that are described in terms
of 2n 9-9 brane pairs which were used in the bound state construction of d-branes in

the original type i theory. in the dual orientifold model, lower-dimensional branes may
then be constructed out of the 7-branes using the descent procedures described earlier.

the appearance of the unitary group u(2n) in the third line of table 7 is then due to the
following facts. recall from section 2.8 that the chiral spinor modules 
2 are complex,
so that, in order to preserve the reality properties of the type i theory, the desired map
which takes us via the cup product between the k-groups of the two type i theories must
be taken with respect to the real spinor module +
2 , as in (3.24). the overall number
of 9-branes required for the bound state construction is given by multiplying the original
number of 9-branes by the dimension of the spinor representation, given in the third

2 

column of table 7. the relevant homotopy is therefore dened with respect to a unitary
symmetric space. physically, the appearance of a unitary gauge symmetry can again be

understood from (5.24), which leads to an inconsistency on 7-branes that are therefore
quantized using the unprojected unitary gauge bundles. thus, while the naive gauge
group on the spacetime lling 9-branes is o(2n)  o(2n)  o(4n), the inconsistent
-projection on iib 7-branes enhances the symmetry to u(2n). the requisite tachyon
eld t (x) is required to be z2-equivariant with respect to the orientifold projection (in
order that the resulting lower dimensional brane congurations be invariant under the
z2-action), i.e. it transforms under the orientifold group as in (6.11). as shown in [17],

76

the tachyon vertex operator for a p-p brane pair acquires the phase (i)7p under the
action of 2. for the 7-branes this operator is even under 2, and so the eigenvalues
of the vacuum expectation value t0 are real. thus the tachyon eld breaks the u(2n)
gauge symmetry down to its orthogonal subgroup o(2n), and the induced brane charge
is labelled by the winding numbers around the vacuum manifold u(2n)/o(2n) of the
iib orientifold on t2/z2. note that, in general, the type ii orientifold on x = y  t1,m
is described by the kr-group krm(x). the explicit relation between the ko- and
kr-groups which implements the t -duality between the type i and orientifold theories

will be described in section 7.4.

for m = 3 we obtain the type i  theory on t3 which is t -dual to the t3/z2 orientifold
of type iia superstring theory. the appearance of a symplectic gauge group in table 7
follows from the mathematical fact that the complex spinor module 3 is the restriction of
a quaternionic cliord module, so that the appropriate augmentation of the spin bundles
on the 9-branes is taken with respect to the rank 4 real representation 3  3. this
means that there are now 4n unstable 9-branes which have an sp(2n) worldvolume gauge
symmetry. this enhanced sp(2n) symmetry comes from the intermediate representation
of a given type i  p  3-brane in terms of 6-6 brane pairs [19] and is easily understood in
terms of 5-branes, as we discussed in section 5.7. again by z2-equivariance the tachyon
eld breaks this gauge group to its complex subgroup u(2n), so that the vacuum manifold

is sp(2n)/u(2n). the rest of table 7 can be deduced from similar arguments. note that
the change of structure of the spinor modules and of the vacuum manifolds after the

m = 4 compactication is in agreement with the property that the orientifold planes then
begin acquiring fractional rr charges, leading to very dierent moduli spaces for these

string theories [74].

in the last column of table 7 we have also indicated the appropriate dual superstring

compactications to the given toroidal compactication of the type i theory (see [74] and
references therein). for the cases m = 4, 5 and 8 we see that the moduli space of the type

i theory (or of the corresponding type ii orientifold) is actually non-perturbatively dual
to a conventional orbifold of type ii superstring theory. the corresponding z2-equivariant
k-groups have been calculated in [19] using the product formulas (2.35) and (2.36), and
the six-term exact sequence (6.9) (see also the computation at the end of section 6.6
to follow). this gives a heuristic way to check the given duality. however, the duality

operations involve an intermediate s-duality transformation of the type ii theory, whose
description within the framework of k-theory is not yet known (see again the discussion

in section 6.6 to follow). thus one does not obtain isomorphisms of the corresponding
k-groups, as would naively be expected. t -duality transformations of k-groups will be

described in section 7.4.

77

having identied the vacuum manifolds of the type ii orientifold models, we shall now

describe the eld content, where one must be careful about identifying the appropriate
homotopy of the relevant vacuum manifolds. the classifying spaces for real vector bundles

are described in [75]. consider an orientifold of the type iib theory, and a set of brane-
antibrane pairs with worldvolume gauge symmetry u(n)u(n). the u(n) gauge group
is endowed with its hermitian conjugation involution, such that the xed point set is the

real subgroup o(n). the tachyon eld t is equivariant with respect to the orientifold
group, so that

t (x,y) = t (x, y)

(6.33)
where (x, y)  rn  rm are coordinates of the transverse space to the induced lower
it breaks the worldvolume gauge symmetry down to
dimensional brane conguration.
u(n)diag. the relevant homotopy group generated by (6.33) comes from decomposing
the one-point compactication of rn,m into upper and lower hemispheres as described in
section 2.7, such that the tachyon eld is the transition function on the overlap. the
d-brane charges thereby reside in the kr-group of the transverse space which is given by

gkr(rn,m) = n,m(cid:16)u(n)(cid:17)r

(6.34)

where the homotopy group is dened by the maps sn,m  u(n) which obey the real
equivariance condition (6.33). the rened bott periodicity theorem for stable homotopy
in kr-theory then reads

n,m(cid:16)u()(cid:17)r

= n+1,m+1(cid:16)u()(cid:17)r

(6.35)

(rn,m) = gkr(rn+1,m) to the
in a similar way one may relate the real k-groups gkr
stable equivariant homotopy of the complex grassmannian manifold u(2n)/[u(n) 
u(n)]. note that the gauge elds living on the brane worldvolumes in these cases must

1

also satisfy an equivariance condition like (6.33). these remarks clarify the meaning of
the term equivariant soliton in the bound state constructions for orbifold and orientifold

theories.

6.5 type ei d-branes and ksc(x)
type i  superstring theory has two orientifold o8 planes which each carry 8 units
of rr charge. there is a natural extension of type i , which involves replacing one of
its o8 planes with an o8+ plane that carries rr charge +8 and is quantized using
symplectic gauge bundles (i.e. with 2 = 1). this theory requires no d8-branes to
make the supersymmetric vacuum neutral, so it has no gauge group, yet it still contains
interesting stable non-bps d-branes in its spectrum. for the classication of d-brane

charges, it is easier to start with the t -dual of this theory, which has been worked out in
[76]. the theory is obtained by gauging a z2-symmetry of type iib on a circle, which
is realized by the composition of the worldsheet parity  with a half-circumference shift

along the circle. this theory is usually called typeei. the natural k-group of typeei d-
brane charges is thus kr(x  s0,2) which, with a trivial involution action on x, is known
to be isomorphic to the k-group ksc(x) of self-conjugate bundles on x [73]. this latter

group can be dened as follows. let x be a compact real manifold with involution  . a
self-conjugate bundle over x is a complex vector bundle e together with an isomorphism
 : e  ( e). self-conjugate k-theory ksc(x) is then dened as the grothendieck
group generated by the category of self-conjugate bundles.

we will rst prove that

kr(x  s0,2) = ksc(x) .

(6.36)

 with
 = {1}. as usual, a real vector bundle e over x  s0,2 is equivalent to the
+ (the corresponding restriction

consider the space x  s0,2 and decompose the circle s0,2 into two halves s0,2

+  s0,2
specication of a complex vector bundle e+ over x  s0,2
of e) together with an isomorphism

 : e|x{+1}

  (e|x{1}) .

(6.37)

since x  {+1} is a deformation retract of x  s0,2
+ , we actually have an isomorphism
 e+|x{+1} which is unique up to homotopy. this means that the speci-
e+|x{1}
cation of  is equivalent, up to homotopy, to giving an isomorphism  : e  ( e).
in other words, isomorphism classes of real bundles over x  s0,2 are in one-to-one cor-
respondence with homotopy classes of self-conjugate bundles over x. taking  to be
trivial, we obtain the desired correspondence between kr(x  s0,2) and the k-theory of
vector bundles e over a compact manifold x equipped with an antilinear automorphism
 : e  e.
using this equivalence, the d-brane charge spectrum of typeei superstring theory can
that k-theory predicts an interesting spectrum of bps and non-bps states in the typeei

be computed using the results of [77], and is summarized in table 8. this demonstrates

79

theory. upon analyzing the corresponding groups gko(sn) and gksp(sn) [32], one correctly

accounts for the stable bps d-branes whose charges are spread out over the two types
of o8-planes. on the other hand, non-bps z2-charged d-branes which are locally stable
near one kind of singular plane can become unstable due to the other singularities in the

complete spacetime [32]. for example, analyzing gko(sn) shows that there is a non-bps

d6-brane which is locally stable near the o8-plane, because the orientifold projection
removes the tachyonic mode present in the d6-brane mirror d6-brane system. however,
the orientifold projection is dierent at the o8+-plane, so that the tachyon is no longer
removed and the non-bps d6-brane is no longer stable in the global theory. the z2-valued
charges in table 8 are precisely those non-bps states which are globally stable.

the classifying space bsc(k) for self-conjugate vector bundles is described in [77], so

that ksc-groups are related to homotopy theory by

ksc(x) =hx , bsc()i .

(6.38)

alternatively, the connection with homotopy theory may be deduced from the kr-theory
representation, from which we can identify the relevant bound state constructions for d-

branes in the typeei theory. from (6.25) it follows that bott periodicity of self-conjugate
k-theory is 4. recall that the group kr4(x  s0,2) associates a symplectic projection
to . the 4-fold periodicity of ksc-theory is thereby the indication that the dual of
type ei has both o8 and o8+ planes, since it means that orthogonal and symplectic

gauge groups appear on equal footing in this model. generally, self-conjugate k-theory is

intimately tied to complex, real and quaternionic k-theories through the following long
exact sequences [78]:

. . .  kn1(x)  kn1(x)  kscn(x)  kn(x) 

 kn(x)  . . .

. . .  kn1(x)  kon(x)  kspn(x)  kn(x)

 kscn2(x)  . . .

 kscn(x)  . . .

(6.39)

(6.41)

which can be established from the kr version of the barratt-puppe exact sequence (2.54)
and the excision theorem (2.48) applied to the pairs (x  s0,p, x  s0,q) for (p, q) = (2, 1),
(3, 1) and (3, 2), respectively. these sequences illustrate how the symmetries of d-brane

congurations whose charges are classied by a given ksc-group are related to webs of
gauge symmetries that appear in the k-theories of type i and type ii strings. these

interrelationships could prove useful in extending the above analysis to other type i
models without vector structure [76].

80

6.6 the hopkins groups k(x)
in this subsection we will study orientifolds of type iib superstring theory obtained via
the quotient by the involution   (1)fl, where fl is the left-moving spacetime fermion
number operator. the operator (1)fl changes the sign of all spacetime elds in the rr
sector, and therefore the rr charge of a bps d-brane changes sign and it gets mapped to
its antibrane under (1)fl. in this case, d-brane congurations on x/(1)fl are related
to those on x whose k-theory class is odd under the z2 action. this means that   maps
the pair (e, f ) to (f, e), i.e. there are isomorphisms  : (e, f )  ( (f ),  (e)) with
( )2 = id. a trivial pair is (h, h) with h =  (h). the corresponding grothendieck
group is called the hopkins group and is denoted by k(x) [17, 29].

it can be shown that the group k(x) may be computed in terms of conventional

equivariant k-theory as

ek(x) = k1

(6.42)
where the cyclic group g = z2 acts on x  r0,1 as the product of the action of  on x
and an orientation-reversing symmetry of r0,1. the validity of the formula (6.42) may be
argued by dening k(x) as a (generalized) cohomology theory that satises the exact
sequence

(x  r0,1) ,

z2

(6.43)

comparing (6.43) with the six-term exact sequence (6.9) for the pair (m, a) = (x 
r0,1, x  (r0,1  pt)) gives the pair of exact sequences:

(6.44)
applying the ve-lemma to (6.44), i.e. that the four isomorphisms between the two exact

sequences in (6.44) imply that the remaining middle vertical mapping is also an isomor-
phism [40], we arrive at (6.42). an independent, algebraic argument using automorphism

groups of the corresponding cliord algebras may also be given [29].

for an orientifold of the type x = rd+1  (r9d/(1)fl  i9d), the corresponding
dp-brane charge over an orientifold d-plane takes values in ek(rdp,9d). since the right-

hand side of (6.42) represents an equivariant functor on the category of complex vector
bundles, we may use the suspension isomorphism with multiplication by c or c/z2 to
derive the periodicities

ek(rp,q) = ek(rp,q+2)

ek(rp,q) = ek(rp+2,q) .

,

81

(6.45)

this implies that ek(rdp,9d) depends only on the parity of p and d. suppose rst that

d is an even integer. then using (6.42) and (6.45) we may compute

(rdp,10d) = kp1

(6.46)

where r[z2] = z  z is the representation ring of the cyclic group z2. thus, when d
is even, we obtain the standard spectrum of bps dp-brane charges for p odd localized
over orientifold planes of odd dimension (the representation ring r[z2] accounts for the
mirror image brane charges induced by the given involution). the situation for d odd
is a bit more involved. for this, we apply the six-term exact sequence (6.9) to the pair
(bdp,9d, sdp,9d) to get

(6.47)

where we have used the suspension isomorphism and rp 9d = s0,9d+1/z2 is the real pro-

jective space. the rst k-group in (6.47) is isomorphic to the hopkins group ek(rdp,9d)

that we are interested in. for the second k-group, we use the fact that the ball b0,9d+1
is equivariantly contractible to get kp
(pt) = p,even r[z2]. the exact
z2
sequence (6.47) thereby relates the k-groups of interest to the cohomology of the real
projective space [51]:

(b0,9d+1) = kp
z2

kp(rp 9d) = p,even z  z2r ,

(6.48)

where r =h 9d

2 i. a careful analysis of the ring structure shows that the epimorphism i

(b0,9d+1) into the generator of kp(rp 9d),
i is a surjective mapping of the free parts of the k-groups. the exactness of the

in (6.47) maps both of the generators of kp
z2
i.e.
sequence (6.47) then implies that

(b0,9d+1) = kp(rp 9d) / kp

for d an odd integer.

as an example, we see that the d-particle over an o5-plane carries an integer-valued

charge. this conguration is s-dual to the stable non-bps d-particle on the o5-plane of
the corresponding   i4 orientifold [8, 10]. the apparent contradiction that arises here
owes to the usual fact that k-theory only classies the charges of topologically stable
objects at weak string coupling, as mentioned in section 6.4. it is an open problem as

of yet to determine how k-theory correctly incorporates the s-duality symmetry of type
iib superstring theory. note that the coincidence of the brane charges (6.50) with those

82

of type iia superstring theory can be traced back to the iib orientifold boundary states

in the case at hand, which are of the form [8, 10]

2(cid:16)|up, +ins  |up,ins(cid:17) + 1

2(cid:16)|t p, +ir + |t p,ir(cid:17) ,

(6.51)

|gdpi = 1

where t and u label the twisted and untwisted sectors of the closed string hilbert space
under the (1)fl orientifold projection. the boundary state (6.51) has precisely the same
form as that of the ordinary type iia dp-brane.

the relationship with the type iia theory can also be seen by taking d = 0 in
the above construction.
in this case we are simply quotienting the iib theory by the
operator (1)fl, which is known to map it into type iia superstring theory. in general,
the operation of modding out the type ii spectrum m times by (1)fl determines a
mapping [19]

ekn(x)  ekn1

z2

(x  r0,m) ,

(6.52)

where now the z2 acts only as a reection on r0,m. the right-hand side of (6.52) may be
evaluated using the six-term exact sequence (6.9). for example, for m = 1 we consider in
(6.9) the pair (xr0,1, x{0}). then the quotient space xr0,1/x{0} is homotopic
to two copies of x  r which are exchanged by the involution. since the z2 action on
this quotient is free, the equivariant k-groups may be computed by using the homotopy

invariance of the k-functor and the suspension isomorphism to get

kn1

z2

(cid:16)(x  r)  (x  r)(cid:17) = kn1(x  r) = kn(x) .

on x  {0} the z2 action is trivial, so that

kn1

z2

(cid:16)x  {0}(cid:17) = kn1(x  pt)  r[z2] .

(6.53)

(6.54)

finally, since in this case x  {0} is an equivariant retract of x  r0,1, we have ker  =
kn1
(x  {0}) and so the horizontal exact sequences in (6.9) split. the general result
is then

part of the z2 action and represents the twisted sector.

the group ekn1(x) in (6.55) comes from the trivial part of the z2 action and as such
represents the untwisted brane charges. the other part eknm1(x) comes from the free
the case n = 0, m = 1 represents the result of quotienting the iib theory by (1)fl
[19]. the projection onto the rst factor in (6.55) thereby represents the condensation of
the quotiented iib brane conguration onto the corresponding iia d-brane (along with
the mirror images under the (1)fl projection). the second direct summand in (6.55)
represents the twisted sector of the (1)fl-quotient which should be properly projected

83

out in the mapping onto the type iia theory. the further quotient by (1)fl corresponds
to taking n = 1, m = 2 in (6.55), which maps back into the iib theory with the same set of
twisted charges projected out. more details about the explicit construction of these maps

in terms of k-theory classes can be found in [19]. this k-theory construction agrees with
the boundary state description in [20] and also the analysis of the open string spectrum
of a type ii p  p-brane conguration in [11]. in the former case it was shown that the
result of quotienting the closed superstring hilbert space by the operator (1)fl projects
onto the ns-ns part of all iib p-brane boundary states, with no contributions from the

twisted sector. the result is then a boundary state of the form (4.10), which, as discussed
in section 4, via tachyon condensation can decay into a stable iia d(p 1) conguration.
on the other hand, the superposition of a p-brane with a p-brane can be described by the
boundary state (c.f. eqs. (3.5) and (3.6))

|dpi + |dpi = |dp, +ins  |dp,ins ,

(6.56)

which thereby produces the same conguration as that obtained above. in these cases,
the k-theory construction shows that the (1)fl quotient on the spacetime-lling type
iib 9-branes leaves an equal number of (identical) 9-branes and 9-branes which are used
in the bound state construction of the p  p brane pair [19]. again this is in complete
agreement with the type iia p  1-brane conguration that is eventually reached by
tachyon condensation. the naturality of the (1)fl mapping as a canonical projection
on k-theory groups is simply an indication of the fact that (1)fl acts as a genuine
non-perturbative symmetry of type ii superstring theory, as discussed in [20].

7 global aspects

this previous section concludes our general analysis of the ways of classifying d-branes
using topological k-theory. there are many more exotic theories that one would like

to study at this stage, for example orientifolds arising from quotients by the operator
  (1)fl  im. however, the corresponding (equivariant) k-groups for such involutions
are not well understood (see [29, 19] for some discussion), and such an analysis must

await further developments in the mathematics literature. let us note that these latter
orientifolds are also important for a more thorough description of the type ii orientifolds
of sections 6.26.4 above, in that the im orientifold projection should strictly speaking
2 (9p)(8p)fl on dp-brane states in
be accompanied by the action of the operator (1)
order to preserve the z2-equivariant structures. it is possible that there are approaches
based on algebraic k-theory which could also be used to incorporate s-duality, and also

1

the construction of m-branes, as has been recently discussed in [33]. we shall not pursue

84

such matters here, which are still at best at a very preliminary stage. instead, in this

nal section we shall proceed to analyze the interesting d-brane congurations that arise
when one accounts for the global topology of the (possibly non-trivial) spacetime x and

the associated brane worldvolume embeddings.

7.1 the chern character

before proceeding to describe the global aspects of d-branes and their associated bound
state constructions, which we will start in section 7.3, we shall rst need some more

mathematical preliminaries. in dealing with global properties of a space, we shall be forced
to consider the cohomology of the manifolds, in addition to the k-theory of the relevant
chan-paton bundles. one of the features of k-theory which makes it so useful in a variety

of applications is the existence of the chern character homomorphism, which provides a
link between k-theory and ordinary cohomology theory by relating the ring k#(x) to
the usual cohomology ring h #(x) (here we shall deal mostly with cech cohomology).
in this subsection we will describe the construction of the chern character in topological

k-theory.

let e be a complex vector bundle of rank k over a compact topological space x.
we can associate to e certain cohomology classes cn(e)  h 2n(x, z) called the chern
characteristic classes of e which measure the twisting of the vector bundle and which
are dened as follows. as in section 2.7, we consider the universal bundle q(k,; c)
over the classifying space bu(k), whose pullbacks generate vector bundles such as e,
i.e. e = f q(k,; c) for a certain map f : x  bu(k). the cohomology ring
h #(bu(k), z) of the classifying space has even-degree generators cn(q(k,; c)) whose
pullbacks under f are precisely the characteristic classes of e:

cn(e)  f cn(cid:16)q(k,; c)(cid:17)  h 2n(x, z) .

(7.1)

the basic properties of these characteristic classes are as follows:

 (i) c0(e) = 1  h 0(x, z).
 (ii) for all l  0, cl(e  f ) =pn+m=l cn(e)  cm(f ).
 (iii) (naturality) if f : y  x is a continuous map, then cn(f e) = f cn(e).

for a rank k bundle e, the total chern class is dened as

c(e) = 1 + c1(e) + . . . + ck(e) ,

(7.2)

85

and from property (ii) above it follows that c(e) is multiplicative,

c(e  f ) = c(e)  c(f ) ,

(7.3)

under whitney sums. in particular, we may invoke the splitting principle which states that
e is always a whitney sum of complex line bundles ln (more precisely, e is the pullback
of some other vector bundle which is a sum of line bundles over another space) [51], and

take

we then have

e = l1  l2      lk .

c(e) =

c(ln) =

kyn=1

(1 + n) ,

kyn=1

(7.4)

(7.5)

where we have dened n  c1(ln). this yields explicit expressions for the chern classes
of e in terms of elementary symmetric functions of the two-cocycles n:

n

c1(e) = xn
c2(e) = xn<m

  
cm(e) =
  

n  m
xn1<n2<<nm

n1  n2      nm

ck(e) = 1  2      k .

the chern character of the vector bundle e is now dened by

ch(e) =

kxn=1

en  h #(x, q) ,

(7.6)

(7.7)

which can be thought of as a generating function for the characteristic classes. note that
it takes values in rational cohomology h #(x, q) = h #(x, z)z q, so that ch(e) cannot
detect any torsion subgroups of the cohomology. using (7.6), the degree 2m part chm(e)
of the inhomogeneous cocycle (7.7) can be written in terms of the characteristic classes
of e. for example,

ch(e)  xm0

chm(e) = k + c1(e) +

1

2(cid:16)c1(e)  c1(e)  2c2(e)(cid:17) + . . . .

(7.8)

the denition of the classes cm(e) (and hence also of the chern character) can be gener-
alized to bundles whose rank is not necessarily constant. for this, one partitions x into
open subsets xi such that the rank of e|xi is constant, and then denes cm(e) as the
unique cohomology class with cm(e)|xi = cm(e|xi).

the chern character enjoys the following properties:

86

 (i) ch0(e) = rk(e)  h 0(x, z).
 (ii) ch(e  f ) = ch(e) + ch(f ).
 (iii) ch(e  f ) = ch(e)  ch(f ).
 (iv) (naturality) ch(f e) = f  ch(e) for any continuous map f : y  x.

these properties imply that the chern character respects the semi-ring structure on the

category of vector bundles. notice that property (i) makes an explicit connection with
the rank function dened in (2.17), i.e. the virtual dimension denes a characteristic class

in degree 0. in fact, we can use the chern character to provide a complete map between
k(x) and the cohomology ring h #(x). namely, for a virtual bundle [(e, f )]  k(x)
we dene the homomorphism

ch : k(x)  h #(x, q)
ch(cid:16)[e]  [f ](cid:17) = ch(e)  ch(f ) .

(7.9)

this map is well-dened provided that [(e, f )] = [(g, h)] in k(x) implies ch(e) 
ch(f ) = ch(g)  ch(h). that this is indeed true is a consequence of the behaviour (ii)
of the chern character under whitney sums. for the particular case where x = s2n, the
map ch is an isomorphism onto h #(s2n, z). more generally, it can be shown [79] that
the associated map

ch : k(x) z q  h even(x, q)  mn0

h 2n(x, q)

(7.10)

is an isomorphism, and moreover that this map extends to a ring isomorphism

ch : k#(x) z q
which maps k1(x) z q onto h odd(x, q).

 h #(x, q)

(7.11)

in the case where x is a smooth manifold, there is a useful explicit description of the
chern character. we assume that e is a smooth vector bundle equipped with a hermitian
connection e, whose curvature is 2
e. the chern character ch(e)  h #(x, r) can then
be represented by the closed inhomogeneous dierential form:

ch(e) = tr exp(cid:16)2

e/2i(cid:17) .

(7.12)

in this case the ns which appear above are the skew-eigenvalues of the two-form 2
e/2i.
to obtain numerical invariants of x, we consider a closed derham current y which is a
delta-function supported representative of the cohomology class of the poincare dual to
 x. then we can associate to y a map iy : k#(x)  c
an embedded submanifold y
dened by the natural bilinear pairing on derham cohomology:

i

iy (e) =dy , ch(e)edr zx

y  ch(e) =zy

i ch(e) .

(7.13)

87

7.2 the thom isomorphism

in this subsection we will describe the thom isomorphism which relates the k-theory of

a manifold x to the k-theory of the total spaces of complex vector bundles over x. in
general, this enables one to compute the k-groups of some relatively complicated spaces

in terms of much simpler base spaces. for example, the k-groups (6.48) of real projective
spaces may be determined by the k-theory of a suitable total space over the base x = pt.

in this way the complete set of k-groups for projective spaces may be determined (see
[51] for the details of such calculations). we shall begin with a description of the map
at the level of cohomology, and then turn to the k-theoretical description. the thom

isomorphism will play an important role in our discussion of brane anomalies in section 7.5.

let x be an oriented manifold of dimension n, and let h #(x) be its cohomology ring
(it will suce to consider the cohomology ring with compact support). a well-known
result of dierential topology is poincare duality, which gives a canonical isomorphism

dx : h p(x)  hnp(x) ,

(7.14)

for all p = 0, 1, . . . , n. now consider another manifold y of dimension m and let f :
y  x be continuous. then for all p  m  n there is a linear map, called the gysin
homomorphism:

which is dened such that the diagram

f! : h p(y )  h p(mn)(x) ,

h p(y )

f! 

dy hmp(y )

 f

h p(mn)(x)

d1

x hmp(x)

(7.15)

(7.16)

is commutative, i.e. such that f! = d1
x f dy . here f is the natural push-forward map
acting on homology. an important example to which this construction applies is the case
that y is an oriented vector bundle e over x of ber dimension k. then we consider the
canonical projection map  : e  x and the inclusion i : x  e of the zero section.
they induce maps on homology with i = id, so that
 h p(x) ,
 h p+k(e) ,

! : h p+k(e)
i! : h p(x)

(7.17)

(7.18)

are isomorphisms for all p. the gysin map ! can be thought of as integration over the
bers of e  x. it is easy to see that !i! = id, so that ! = (i!)1. the map (7.18) is
called the thom isomorphism of the oriented vector bundle e.

88

an important special instance of the thom isomorphism (7.18) is the case p = 0.
this denes a map h 0(x)  h k(e), and the image of 1  h 0(x) thereby determines a
cohomology class

[e] = i!(1)  h k(e) ,

(7.19)

which is called the thom class of e. the thom isomorphism (7.18) is then generated by
taking the cup product with this class:

i!() = ()  (e) .

(7.20)

this cohomology class will play a central role in section 7.5. it is related to the euler
class (e) of the (even dimensional) real vector bundle e  x of rank k = 2m, which
is a characteristic class of the bundle taking values in h 2m(x). it can be dened as the
pullback of the thom class by the zero section:

(e) = i [e] .

(7.21)

when e is a complex vector bundle of rank k, then the euler class of e is dened as the
euler class of its underlying real bundle er (of real rank 2k): (e)  (er). moreover,
in this case the euler class of e can be shown to coincide with the top chern class:

(e) = ck(e) =

kyn=1

n .

(7.22)

if the (real) rank of the vector bundle e coincides with the dimension of x, then one can

also introduce the euler number e(e), which is dened as the euler class evaluated on
the homology cycle [x]:

e(x) = (e)[x] =zx

(e) .

(7.23)

furthermore, if x is compact, then for all   h #(x) we have the identity [52]

i i!() = (e)   ,

(7.24)

which follows from the fact that the euler class is given as (e) = i i!(1). another
important property of these cohomology classes is that if s : x  e is any section of e,
then s[e] is a closed form whose cohomology class coincides with the euler class. from
this fact one may also deduce that s[e] = z(s), where z(s)
 x is the zero locus of
the section s, so that

i

zz(s)

i  =zx

s [e]   .

(7.25)

let us now describe the thom isomorphism in k-theory which, using the chern char-
acter, can be related to the cohomological thom isomorphism above. let e  x be

89

a complex vector bundle over x. then k#(e) is naturally a k#(x)-module, with an
associative and distributive module multiplication,

dened according to the sequence of homomorphisms

k#(x) z k#(e)  k#(e) ,

k#(x) z k#(e)  k#(x  e)  k#(e) .

(7.26)

(7.27)

here the rst map is induced by the cup product and the second map is the pullback on
k-theory of the map   id. an important example is the case when e = i m = x  cm
is the trivial complex vector bundle over x. dene   k(e) to be the class

 =hevene , odde ; i ,

(7.28)

where e is the trivial m-plane bundle over e and even,odde denote the even and odd
degree exterior product bundles corresponding to e. the isomorphism  is dened by

x,v() = v    v   ,

(7.29)

for (x, v)  x  cm and   evene. using the identication r2m = cm and choosing

the canonical orientation, this element can be written as

 = [s+,s; ] ,

(7.30)

where s = s+  s is the irreducible complex graded c2m-module (extended trivially
over x), so that, according to (2.78), x,v() = v   coincides with the usual cliord
multiplication. the fundamental bott periodicity theorem then implies that k#(e) is a
free k#(x)-module of rank 1 with generator , so that  gives a k-theory orientation for
the bundle e.

now consider a general (possibly non-trivial) complex vector bundle over x. we
say that   k(e) is a bott class if  determines a k-theory orientation in any local
trivialization of e over a closed subset c  x, i.e. k#(e|c) is a free k#(c)-module
generated by  whenever e|c is trivial. it can be shown [51, 52] that any bott class is
a k-theory orientation for e. in particular, if e  x is a complex hermitian vector
bundle over a compact space x, then the class

1(e) =hevene , odde ; i  k(e) ,

(7.31)

with v() = v    v  , denes a k-theory orientation for e. this follows from the
example above which showed that 1(e) is a bott class. the k-group element (7.31) is
the k-theoretic thom class of the vector bundle e, which is natural and multiplicative:

1(e  f ) = 1(e)  1(f ) .

(7.32)

90

by taking cup products with it, it follows that the map i! : k(x)  k(e) dened by

i!() = ()  1(e) ,   k(x) ,

(7.33)

is an isomorphism. this is the thom isomorphism in complex k-theory. when x = pt
is the space consisting of a single point, and e = cn is the trivial bundle over x, then

the thom isomorphism is just the statement of bott periodicity in the form ek(s2n) = z.
this follows from the fact that k(x) = k(pt) = z and k(e) = k(cn) = ek(s2n). more
generally, taking e = i m = x  cm and using r2m = cm, the thom isomorphism is just

the statement of bott periodicity in the form of the suspension isomorphism (2.22). for

some more examples and applications, as well as the description of the thom isomorphism
in ko-theory and kr-theory, see [51, 52].

the relationship between the k-theoretic and cohomological thom isomorphisms may
be described as follows. let e  x be a complex vector bundle of rank m, and let
: h #(x, q)  h #(e, q) be the thom isomorphisms in k-
ik
!
theory and cohomology, respectively. we introduce the natural, multiplicative todd class
td(e)  h even(x, q) by

: k(x)  k(e) and ih

!

td(e) =

1  en
2 c1(e) + 1

= 1 + 1

n

myn=1

12(cid:16)c1(e)  c1(e) + c2(e)(cid:17) + . . . .

then for each class   k(x), we have the formula:

ch(cid:16)ik

! ()(cid:17) = ih

! (cid:16)ch()  td(e)(cid:17) .

(7.34)

(7.35)

the thom isomorphism also enables the construction of a k-theoretic gysin map
which will be a crucial ingredient in the global bound state construction that will be
presented in the next subsection. consider an embedding f : y  x of a submanifold
y of even codimension 2k in x. (the restriction to embeddings is not necessary but is
assumed for simplicity.) the normal bundle n(y, x) of y in x can be dened through

the exact sequence of vector bundles:

0  t y

f t x  n(y, x)  0

(7.36)

which decomposes the tangent bundle t x of x as t x = t y  n(y, x). this identies
the normal bundle with a tubular neighbourhood of y in x (this means that one chooses

a suitable metric on x and denes n(y, x) to be the set of all points of distance < 
from y in x, for some small ), and also with the bundle f (t x)/t y over y . the vector
bundle n(y, x) has structure group so(2k), which we assume is extendable globally to
spin(2k), i.e. n(y, x) admits a spin structure. (again this requirement can be relaxed,

91

but we will defer this discussion to the next subsection). given the thom isomorphism
i! : k(y )  k(n(y, x)), we then dene the gysin homomorphism by

f = j  i! : k(y )  k(x)

(7.37)

 x of locally compact spaces. the
where j is induced by the morphism n(y, x)
map f is independent of the choice of tubular neighbourhood and it depends only on
the homotopy class of f . its basic properties are as follows. first of all, if f : y  x
and g : z  y are two embeddings, then (f  g) = f  g. furthermore, there are the
identities

j

f(  f ) = f()   ,

  k(y ),   k(x)

and, if x is compact,

f   f() = (cid:16)n(y, x)(cid:17)  

(7.38)

(7.39)

where the k-theoretic euler class is dened as the restriction of the corresponding k-
theoretic thom class to the zero section. in the same way, one may construct the gysin
homomorphism for ko-theory, with the further requirements that dim x  dim y 
0 mod 8 and that n(y, x) admits a spin structure.

7.3 global version of the bound state construction

the bound state constructions that we have described thus far only apply locally in the

spacetime x. in this subsection we will discuss the features that arise when global topol-
ogy is taken into account. we shall describe the details only for type iib superstring

theory, as then the generalization to other string theories will be evident. for this, we
must be careful about the topology of the (non-trivial) normal bundle of the d-brane

worldvolume in x, which must thereby be treated more carefully using the thom isomor-
phism and the gysin map discussed in the previous subsection. actually, the mapping
(3.23) is a local version of the thom isomorphism, with the transverse space s2k identi-
ed with the normal bundle of y in x and y  b2k with a small neighbourhood of y
in spacetime. globally then, the thom isomorphism f! : k(y )  k(x) applied to the
normal bundle n(y, x)  y yields the mapping

[e] 7 f![e] = (cid:16)[e](cid:17)  1(cid:16)n(y, x)(cid:17) .

(7.40)

a representative of the thom class of the normal bundle is then given by the abs con-

struction, as described above. however, to achieve the map (7.40) one needs to extend
the bundle e to the whole of x, which requires some special care and treatment of
the normal bundle topology that we shall now discuss. the main idea is that the global
obstructions which prevent the abs class [s+,s; ] from producing a k-theory class of

92

k(x) can be typically eliminated by nucleating extra 9-branes and 9-branes. in certain

cases (to be described below) one has to stabalize (in the k-theory sense) the original con-
guration of 9-branes and 9-branes by pair creating extra 9  9-brane congurations and
thus yield a conguration of 99-brane pairs with k-theory class [s+h,sh; id].
this construction will then demonstrate that, globally, brane charges in a spacetime x
can always be described by a conguration of 9-branes and 9-branes [17] and are therefore

classied by k(x).

let us start with the case of codimension 2. recall that in the case of at brane
worldvolumes, in order to build a p-brane we need a p + 2-brane-antibrane pair wrapping
a submanifold rp+3 of the spacetime x which gives rise to a u(1)  u(1) gauge eld
and a tachyon eld t of charges (1,1). t vanishes on a codimension 2 subspace that
is identied with the worldvolume of the p-brane and breaks the gauge symmetry from
u(1) u(1) to u(1). for the global construction, let y  z be the worldvolume manifold
of the p-brane embedded in the p + 3 dimensional submanifold z of spacetime. to build
such a p-brane we consider a p + 2-brane-antibrane pair on z. let l be a complex line
bundle over z and  a section of l that vanishes on y . by placing a u(1) gauge eld on
the p + 2-brane, with the same p-brane charge as that of a p-brane on y , and a trivial
u(1) gauge eld on the p + 2-brane, the system can be interpreted as a p-brane wrapping
y .

however, a p-brane wrapping y also has in general lower-dimensional brane charges
p  2, p  4, . . . which depend on the choice of a line bundle k on y . if the line bundle k
extends over z then a p-brane wrapping y is described by taking the bundle lk on the
p + 2 brane and the bundle k on the p + 2 brane. if k does not extend over y , then one
uses the following classic k-theory construction [57]. let y  be a tubular neighborhood
of y in z, whose closure we denote by y and whose boundary is y . if e and f are

bundles over y of the same rank then they determine an element of ek(y ). the inclusion
i : y  y then induces a map on k-theory such that (e, f ) also denes a unique element
of ek(y ). the tachyon eld is a map t : e  f , which is an isomorphism of vector
bundles outside an open set u  x whose closure u is compact. now suppose that t is
also a tachyon eld on y which is an isomorphism on y . in that case one can construct
a natural map ek(y )  ek(z), showing that d-branes wrapping y are classied by k(z),
as desired. this map can be described as follows. let z  = z  y . if we can extend
the bundle f from y to all of z  then f would be dened over all of z. since e and
f are isomorphic (under the map t ) on y , in that case e can also be extended over

z , so that (e, f ) would dene an element of ek(z). if f does not extend over z, then
we may use swans theorem to construct a bundle h over y such that f  h is trivial
(assuming y is compact) and therefore also trivial on y . now we replace e  e  h,

93

f  f  h and t  t  id. then we can extend f  h over z and also extend e  h
by setting it equal to f  h over z , so that (e  h, f  h) denes an element of ek(z).
in summary, if k does not extend over z, then one instead nds a bundle h over y such
that k  h is trivial. then the bundle l  k  h can be extended over z. if we now
consider a collection of p + 2-branes on z with gauge bundle l  k  h and a collection
of p + 2-branes on z with bundle k  h, along with a tachyon eld which equals t  id
near y and is in the gauge orbit of the vacuum outside y , then this system describes a
p-brane on y with gauge bundle k.

in the case that y is of codimension greater than 2 in x, one proceeds as follows.
let y be of codimension 2k in x. its normal bundle n(y, x) in x then has structure

group so(2k). suppose rst that n(y, x) is a spin manifold, so that its second stiefel-
whitney class vanishes in h 2(n(y, x), z2), w2(n(y, x)) = 0. then associated with the
2k1 9  9-brane pairs we get a pair of spinor bundles s which are identied with the
gauge bundles on the 9-branes. as usual, the tachyon eld is a map t : s  s+ with

t (x) =

2kxi=1

i xi

, x  y 

(7.41)

and the system describes a p-brane wrapped on y . this conguration can be extended
over x if s extends. otherwise one can nd a bundle h such that s  h extends
and then replace (s+,s)  (s+  h,s  h) and also t  t  id. similarly, for a
p-brane with line bundle k, we start from the pair of bundles k  s and use the same
construction just presented.

let us now relax the requirement that n(y, x) be a spin manifold. according to
the analysis of [80], for type ii compactications with vanishing cosmological constant,
the normal bundle to a d-brane wrapping a supersymmetric cycle always admits a spinc
structure. this means that instead of being extendable to a principal spin(2k) bundle
over y , the structure group of the normal bundle extends to spinc(2k), where spinc(n) =
spin(n)z2 u(1) is the quotient of the product group spin(n) u(1) by the equivalence
relation (p, z)  (p,z) and it covers the rotation group so(n) according to the split
exact sequence

1  u(1)  spinc(n)  so(n)  1 .

(7.42)

the criteria for the existence of a spinc structure can be formulated as follows. consider
the split exact sequence

0  z 2 z  z2  0 ,

(7.43)

where the third map is reduction modulo 2. this sequence gives rise to a long exact

sequence in cohomology

. . .  h n(x, z) 2 h n(x, z)  h n(x, z2)

 h n+1(x, z)  . . .

(7.44)

94

where the map  is called the bockstein homomorphism. the kernel of  is the set
of classes in h #(x, z2) which are modulo 2 reductions of integral cohomology classes.
if wn  h n(x, z2) denotes the n-th stiefel-whitney class of x, then wn  (wn1)
measures whether or not the (n  1)-th stiefel-whitney class is the modulo 2 reduction
of an integral class. the normal bundle n(y, x) admits a spinc structure if and only if
w3(n(y, x)) = 0 (so that in particular any spin manifold is canonically a spinc manifold).
since x is a spin manifold, w1(x) = w2(x) = 0, and y is orientable, w1(y ) = 0,
one can easily show using multiplicativity of the total stiefel-whitney class [17] that
w2(n(y, x)) = w2(y ) and therefore also that w3(n(y, x)) = w3(y ). thus n(y, x)
admits a spinc structure only if the p-brane worldvolume manifold y does.

the existence of a spinc structure on n(y, x) implies the following features for the
bound state construction. let ui be an open covering of x. the transition functions
gij of s+ on ui  uj are then maps gij : ui  uj  spin(2k). the existence of a spin
structure is equivalent to the vanishing of the two-cocycle

ijk  gijgjkgki : ui  uj  uk  z2 ,

(7.45)

in h 2(x, z2). this denes a cohomology class []  h 2(x, z2), which vanishes precisely
when n(y, x) is a spin manifold and n(y, x) admits a spinc structure if [] is the
modulo 2 reduction of an integral class in h 2(x, z). let l be the complex line bundle
corresponding to this integral class (i.e. c1(l) is equal to this element in h 2(x, z)), and
let ij : ui  uj  s1 be the transition functions for l. suppose we want to nd a square
root of l, i.e. a line bundle l1/2 with l1/2  l1/2 = l. then since ui  uj is contractible
we can dene a square root ij  ij : ui  uj  s1. the obstruction to the existence

of a consistent set of transition functions ij is the two-cocycle


ijk  ij jkki : ui  uj  uk  z2 = ker 

where  is the map (z)  z2 corresponding to the split exact sequence

0  z2  s1

 s1  0 .

(7.46)

(7.47)

the class []  h 2(x, z2) is the coboundary of []  h 1(x, s1) under the associated
long exact sequence in cohomology. in fact, consider the following commutative diagram:

h 1(x, s1)

 h 1(x, s1)



 h 2(x, z2)



h 2(x, z)



k

2 h 2(x, z)

 h 2(x, z2)

it follows that [] = (c1(l)) = [] and therefore [] + [] = 0, or equivalently

c1(l)  w2(cid:16)n(y, x)(cid:17) mod 2 .

95

(7.48)

(7.49)

this means that while we cannot construct the spinor bundles and we cannot construct
the complex line bundle l1/2 globally, we can construct their tensor product. thus, the
existence of a spinc structure means that l1/2  s exist as vector bundles even though
l1/2 and s do not. this in turn means that if n(y, x) is a spinc bundle then we can
proceed as in the case of spin bundles with the pair (l1/2  s+,l1/2  s) determining
an element of k(x) and representing a d-brane wrapped on y .

7.4 compactications and t -duality

a t -duality transformation maps type iia superstring theory to type iib superstring
theory, under which a dp-brane is mapped to a d(p  1)-brane if the transformation
is done in a direction transverse to the brane worldvolume. since type iib branes are
classied by k(x) and type iia branes by k1(x), it is natural to study the action of
t -duality at the level of k-groups [32, 30, 19]. for this, we shall need to understand how
to measure d-brane charge on spacetime compactications in terms of k-theory and how

to achieve natural isomorphisms of the corresponding k-groups.

we rst need to explain an intimate connection between the index theory of fredholm

operators and topological k-theory, which will also be used in the next subsection. a
fredholm operator t , acting on a separable hilbert space h, is a bounded linear operator
whose kernel and cokernel are nite dimensional subspaces of h. such operators therefore
have a well-dened index:

index t = dim ker t  dim coker t ,

which is invariant under perturbations by any compact operator a,

index(t + a) = index t .

(7.50)

(7.51)

moreover, if s is a bounded operator that is suciently close in the operator norm to t ,
then s is also a fredholm operator and indext = index s.

the importance of these properties stems from the fact that one can also describe the
group k(x) in terms of fredholm operators. for this, let f be the space of fredholm
operators on h with the operator norm topology. then (7.50) denes a continuous map
(7.52)

index : f  z ,

which can be shown to induce a bijection

0(f )  z

(7.53)

between the set of connected components of f and the integers. more generally, let x
be a compact topological space and consider the set [x,f ] of homotopy classes of maps

96

from x to f . since the product of two fredholm operators is again a fredholm operator,
[x,f ] is a monoid. it can be shown that there is an isomorphism:

[x,f ]  k(x) ,

(7.54)

which may be described as follows. let tx be a continuous family of fredholm operators
labelled by the parameter x  x. then the family of vector spaces kertx forms a vector
bundle ker t over x. this statement is also true for the cokernel of t , so that we can
dene the index of a family of operators tx as the class

index t h(kert , coker t )i  k(x) .

(7.55)

note that this is similar to the correspondence that was made in (2.20). with this
correspondence, the composition of operators in f corresponds to the addition in k(x),
while adjoints correspond to inversion. in particular, in the case where x is a point (so

that k(x) = z) the isomorphism (7.54) is just the index map (7.53). in other words, the
virtual dimension of the k-theory class (7.55) coincides with the index dened in (7.50):

ch0(index t ) = indext .

(7.56)

moreover, the set of homotopy classes of fredholm operators denes the k-homology
group k0(x). the duality with k-theory is provided by the natural bilinear pairing

(cid:16)[e] , [f ](cid:17) 7 index fe  z

(7.57)

where [e]  k(x) and fe = fe,e denotes the action of the fredholm operator f on the
hilbert space h = l2((x, e)) of square-integrable sections of the vector bundle e  x
as f : (x, e)  (x, e).

for the present purposes we shall be interested in applying these ideas to a special

class of operators, namely the dirac operators associated to vector bundles over a spin
manifold x. dirac operators are examples of pseudo-dierential elliptic operators, which

are fredholm operators when viewed as operators on a hilbert space. to this end, we
consider the case f = id/ : (x,s+
e ), where e  x is a real spin bundle
(of even rank) and s
e are the corresponding twisted chiral spinor bundles lifted from e.
the chern character (7.9) (along with a version of the gysin map introduced at the end
of section 7.2) then allows one to map the analytical index of id/ dened in terms of k-

e )  (x,s

theory classes into a topological index which can be expressed in terms of cohomological
characteristic classes. the result is the celebrated atiyah-singer index theorem [81]:

index id/ = zx

ch(e)  ba(t x)

97

(7.58)

where the dirac genus of the vector bundle e is dened by

ba(e) = yn

n/2

sinh(n/2)

= 1 

1
24

p1(e) +

1

5760(cid:16)7p1(e)  p1(e)  4p2(e)(cid:17) + . . .

(7.59)

and pn(e) = (1)nc2n(e r c) is the n-th pontryagin class of e. an important special
instance of this index formula is obtained by taking e = t x to be the tangent bundle
of the manifold x. then the euler number (7.23) can be expressed in terms of the

euler-poincare characteristic of x:

e(x) = dim k(x) z q  dim k1(x) z q .

(7.60)

we can apply these ideas to give an index-theoretical interpretation of t -duality acting
on k-theory classes in various superstring theories [30]. the basic motivation for this

analysis is the expression for the transformation of rr tensor elds under t -duality [82].
it can be shown that the rr elds on spacetimes of the form tn  m and those of the
t -dual theory on btn  m (where btn is the dual torus of tn) are related according to (in

the absence of a neveu-schwarz b-eld)

ch = ztn

ch(p)  h ,

ch(p) = exp  nxi=1

dbyi  dyi!

(7.61)

(7.62)

where h =pp h (p+2) is the gauge-invariant, total rr form eld strength. here

is the chern character of the poincare (complex line) bundle p over btn  tn, with yi
and byi dual coordinates on tn and btn. the poincare bundle is dened as the quotient
of the trivial bundle tn  (rn)  c by the action of the rank n lattice 2 (where
tn = rn/2) dened by (x, x, z) 7 (x, x + m, eim
i xiz). the relationship (7.61) is
reminescent of a formula that arises in the family index theory [81] for a family of dirac
operators on tn parametrized by btn which is carried by the bundle p over btn tn. this

motivates the search for a relatively simple explanation of the transformation property
(7.61) in terms of k-theory which provides the analogous transformation rule for d-branes

(which are sources for the rr elds).

for illustration, let us consider the case of d-branes in type iib superstring theory
compactied on a circle s1. spacetime is then s1  m, where m is a nine-dimensional
manifold, and the dual geometry is bs1  m. as usual, a type iib d-brane is constructed
as a bound state of 9 9-branes with chan-paton bundles s, gauge connections a and

98

a tachyon eld t : s+  s. we probe this system with a d1-brane wrapped on s1, so
that the dual system is a d0-brane moving in bs1  m. the mass matrix of the fermionic
modes coming from the 1  9 and 1  9 strings is given by the dirac operator

t d ! =  y  ia

id/ =  d+ t 
y  ia is the dirac operator on s1 coupled to the connection a

y + ia ! + a .

y  ia
on the bundle s  p, where p is the poincare bundle over s1  bs1 with curvature
ida dy. the operator (7.63) can be interpreted as the usual dirac operator twisted by
the superconnection (3.16) on the 9 9-branes coupled to the probe d-strings. it can also
be interpreted as the tachyon eld of the unstable type iia 9-branes of the t -dualized

here d = y + a

(7.63)

0

0

system [30], whereby the wilson line on a dp-brane is mapped onto the position of a
d(p  1)-brane (c.f. eq. (4.21)).

since id/ is a skew-adjoint operator its index vanishes identically as an element of
k(s1m). rather, it can be shown [81] that the index takes values in the higher k-group
k1(bs1  m) of the parameter space for the family through the following construction.
given the family id/ (x) of skew-adjoint fredholm operators labelled by x  w = bs1  m,
one can dene a family over [ 

2 ]  w by

2 , 

ied/ (t, x) =  sin t + id/ (x) cos t .

this is no longer a skew-adjoint operator and therefore it can have distinct kernel and
2 , x) = 1, its kernel and cokernel are
2 ] w ) = k1(w ).

cokernel. furthermore, since ied/ ( 
isomorphic at t =  
it follows then that t -duality determines a map:

2 , x) = ied/ ( 
2 and therefore index ied/  k([ 

2 ] w, [ 

2 , 

2 , 

(7.64)

(7.65)

(7.66)

which can be identied as the sequence of homomorphisms:

k(s1  m)  k1(bs1  m)

k(s1  m)

[p]

 k(s1 bs1  m)

index id/

 k1(bs1  m) ,

where the last map is dened by [(e, f )] 7 index id/ e,f . in an analogous way one may
construct the inverse map, so that the transformation (7.66) is actually an isomorphism
of k-groups. to compare the transformation (7.66) with (7.61), we compute the index
using the family index theorem to get

ch(index id/ ep) =zs1

ch(e  p)  ba(t s1)

(7.67)

with ba(t s1) = 1 and ch(e  p) = ch(e)  ch(p). since the k-groups of s1 are tor-

sion free, the chern character (7.9) is an isomorphism onto the subring h even(s1, z)

99

of h even(s1, q), which makes the connection with the formula (7.61). this construc-
tion can be generalized to compactications on the n-torus tn, thus dening maps

km(tn  m)  km1(btn  m). similar arguments can be applied to real vec-

tor bundles [81], yielding the corresponding maps on kr-groups appropriate for the type
i and type ii orientifold theories.

there is another way to see the t -duality isomorphism in terms of relative k-theory
[32]. consider a general compactication manifold z of dimension d. we want to deter-
mine all d-brane charges of codimension m in the non-compact space r9d. these charges
arise from d-branes which wrap non-trivial cycles of z and from d-branes located at par-
ticular points in z. as usual, one considers congurations of nite energy and therefore
only those which are equivalent to the vacuum asymptotically in the transverse space rm.
so rm is replaced by its one-point compactication sm by the addition of a copy of the
compactication manifold z at innity. this corresponds precisely to considering charges
which take values in the relative k-group (2.47) (with y = z and x = sm  z). thus,
for example, for compactications of type iib superstring theory on a submanifold z,
d-brane charges are classied by k(sm  z, z), and by k1(sm  z, z) for type iia
compactications. for instance, consider the compactication of type ii on an n-torus
tn. by iterating the relations (2.35), (2.36) and (2.55), one may easily derive the natural
isomorphisms

k(m  tn, tn) =

nmk=0ekk(m)(n
= k1(m  tn, tn) .

k) = ek(m)2n1

 k1(m)2n1

(7.68)

from this point of view, type ii t -duality is then a consequence of the periodicity of 2
of complex k-theory. furthermore, from (2.40) we see that under the isomorphism (7.68)

of k-groups for n = 1, ek(m) z k(s1) maps to ek(m) z k1(s1) with the summands

k(s1) and k1(s1) interchanged. from this it follows that t -duality exchanges wrapped
and unwrapped d-brane congurations. for n > 1, the decomposition (7.68) gives the
anticipated degeneracies 2n1 of brane charges arising from the higher supersymmetric
branes wrapped on various cycles of the torus tn. this may be attributed to the fact
that the t -duality mapping generates the spinor representation of the target space duality
group o(n, n, z), in agreement with the fact that o(n, n, z) acts on the iia and iib rr

potentials in the positive and negative chirality spinor representations, respectively. the
complete agreement with the predictions of cohomology theory is once again a consequence
of the chern isomorphism of the integer k-groups of tn with the corresponding integer
cohomology ring.

this analysis generalizes to other string theories as well. for instance, we can write
down the explicit t -duality isomorphism between d-brane charges of type i compactied

100

on a torus and those of the corresponding type ii orientifold compactication. using the

analog of the decomposition (2.55) for ko-theory and (5.12), we may iteratively compute
the relevant group for the compactication of the type i theory,

ko(m  tn, tn) =

k

k)
(m)(n

nmk=0gko

(7.69)

whereas for the corresponding t -dual orientifold theory we may use (6.27) to get

krn(m  t1,n, t1,n) =

n,k

nmk=0gkr
k) =
(m)(n
= ko(m  tn, tn) .

kn

k)
(m)(n

nmk=0gko

(7.70)

where we have used the fact that the kr-involution acts trivially on m. the correspond-
ing spectrum of bps and z2 non-bps d-branes agrees again with the degeneracies of
the various wrapped branes. the complexity of the decomposition (7.70) as compared
to the type ii case owes to the periodicity of 8 of the ko and kr-groups, as discussed

in section 6.4. in these cases, the precise bookkeeping of d-brane charges requires the
concept of d-brane transfer, whereby a d-brane which is located over an orientifold

plane is transfered via a wrapped d-brane of one higher dimension to another orien-
tifold plane. this is required to compensate for the apparently absent z2 charges in the
k-theory spectrum (7.69) (see [32] for more details).

other k-theoretic interpretations of the t -duality isomorphism may also be given. in

[31] it was discussed how to describe type ii d-branes wrapped on complex submani-
folds of complex varieties using a holomorphic version of k-theory (more precisely, the

grothendieck groups of coherent and locally free sheaves), which further encodes a choice
of connection on the brane worldvolume, and how the action of t -duality can be under-

stood in terms of fourier-mukai transformations (see also [30]). in [19], t -duality was
interpreted as being a consequence of the weak bott periodicity sequence for the stable
homotopy groups of the nite-dimensional vacuum manifolds for the type ii and type i

theories (c.f. section 6.4).

7.5 d-brane anomalies

in the nal part of this review we will derive an explicit formula for the charge of a dp-
brane when it wraps a submanifold y of the spacetime x. locally, this formula has its

origin in ordinary cohomology theory, but as we shall demonstrate, when global topol-
ogy is taken into account the expression involves quantities which are most naturally

understood in terms of k-theory [34] in exactly the same spirit as our previous discus-
sions of d-brane charge. the basic idea comes from the fact that a weyl fermion on

101

an even-dimensional manifold always yields an anomalous variation of its action given

by the well-known descent formula [83]. this formula determines the anomaly in terms
of the representation of the gauge group carried by the fermions, and the corresponding

yang-mills and gravitational connections. the same phenomenon occurs whenever a d-
brane wraps around a non-trivial supersymmetric cycle of a curved manifold, because the
twisting of its normal bundle can induce chiral asymmetry in its worldvolume eld theory.

the form of these chiral anomalies can be deduced by considering the eld content on the
intersection of two branes, which contains chiral fermions. the anomaly term then comes

from the tensor product of the spinor bundles with the chan-paton vector bundles over
the two d-branes. the anomalous zero modes on the intersection of the branes come from

the massless excitation spectrum of the worldvolume eld theory which consists of weyl
fermions in the mixed sector n1  n2 and n1  n2 representations of the gauge group
u(n1)u(n2) on the intersecting brane worldvolume. to render the theory anomaly-free
thereby requires the addition of wess-zumino terms to the d-brane action. these induced
terms imply that topological defects (such as instantons or monopoles) on the d-branes

carry their own rr charge determined by their topological quantum numbers [27, 68].

let f : y  x be the embedding of a p+1 dimensional brane worldvolume y into the
spacetime manifold x of type iib superstring theory. the anomalous d-brane coupling
takes the form of a wess-zumino type action,

sy =zy

f  c  y(2

e, g) ,

(7.71)

where c =pp c (p+1) is the total rr form potential and y(2
e, g) is the d-brane source
eld which is an invariant polynomial of the yang-mills eld strength and gravitational
curvature on y . here e is the hermitian curvature of a u(n) gauge bundle e on the
brane, while g is the restriction of the spacetime metric to y . the anomalies on the

d-brane result from the chiral asymmetry of their massless fermionic modes which are
in one-to-one correspondence with the ground states of the relevant open string ramond

sectors. open string quantization requires the ramond ground states to be sections of
the spinor bundle lifted from the spacetime tangent bundle t x tensored with a vector
bundle in the adjoint n  n representation of the brane gauge group u(n), as dictated
by the incorporation of the usual chan-paton factors. the gso projection restricts the
fermions to have a denite so(9, 1) chirality. when the normal bundle of y in x is

trivial, so that t x = t y , a standard index-theoretical calculation gives

(7.72)

however, the cohomology class (7.72) needs to be rened in the case that the normal
bundle is non-trivial and, as we will demonstrate, this renement leads to a formula

y0(2

e, g) = ch(e)  f qba(t x) .

102

for the d-brane rr charge which is most naturally understood in terms of k-theory

classes, rather than cohomology classes. assuming that n(y, x) admits a spin structure,
one can determine the fermion quantum numbers of the spinor bundle associated with
n(y, x). when n(y, x) 6= , the fermions have quantum numbers (+, +) (,) under
the worldvolume lorentz group spin(1, p) and the spacetime lorentz group spin(9  p)
restricted to n(y, x). if the normal bundle is at, then left- and right-moving fermions

in the worldvolume eld theory are treated equally and the theory is non-chiral. however,
when n(y, x) has a non-vanishing curvature, chiral asymmetry is induced on the brane
worldvolume and a distinction arises between the (+, +) and (,) quantum numbers.
it is well-known that the index of the dirac operator on an even-dimensional manifold

x gives the perturbative chiral gauge anomaly of a dirac spinor on x. the positive and
negative chirality spinor bundles s
t x corresponding to the tangent bundle of x can be
decomposed in terms of the positive and negative chirality spin bundles s
lifted from the tangent and normal bundles to y in x:

t y and s

n (y,x)

t x =hs
s

t y  s+

n (y,x)i hs

t y  s

n (y,x)i

the dirac operator for the charged and reduced fermions acts on sections of the bundles
(7.73) via the two-term complex

id/ : (y, e+)  (y, e) ,

where

e =(cid:16)hs

t y  s+

n (y,x)i hs

n (y,x)i(cid:17)  e .

the standard index theorem applied to the two-term complex (7.74,7.75) yields

(7.74)

(7.75)

(7.76)

(7.77)

ch(s+

e )  ch(s

e ) =

ba(e)

which holds for any orientable, real spin bundle e, we see that the appropriate modica-
tion of (7.72) due to the normal bundle topology is

y(2

e, g) = y0(2

e, g) hba(cid:16)n(y, x)(cid:17)i1

.

(7.78)

in arriving at (7.78) we have re-written (7.71) as an integral over x using the appropriate
derham current y , and used the discussion of section 7.2 (c.f. eq. (7.25)) to write

y  (cid:16)n(y, x)(cid:17) = y  y .

103

(7.79)

finally, as with the total chern class, the dirac genus is a multiplicative characteristic

class, so that ba(t x) = ba(t y )  ba(n(y, x)) and eq. (7.78) can be written as

y(2

e, g) = ch(e) vuuut ba(t y )
ba(cid:16)n(y, x)(cid:17) .

(7.80)

now we will describe how the anomalous coupling aects brane charges in the language
of k-theory. to obtain the d-brane charge, we study the rr equations of motion and

bianchi identity coming from the complete action for the rr tensor elds:

s = 

1

4zx

h(c)  h(c) 

(p)

2 zx

y  f c  y(2

e, g) ,

(7.81)

where h(c) is the curvature of c. then the equations of motion and bianchi identity
for a given (p + 1  m)-form potential are

d h(c) = (p) y  y(2
e, g)
dh(c) = (p) y  y(2

e, g) ,

(7.82)

where y is obtained from y by complex conjugation of the chan-paton gauge group
representation (note that cn(e) = (1)ncn(e), so that the chern classes are torsion
cohomology classes in the case that e = e and n is odd). from eq. (7.80) it follows that
the formula for the charge vector q  h #(x) dened on the right-hand side of (7.82) is

where f! : h n(y, z)  h n+9p(x, z) is the (push-forward) gysin map acting on coho-
mology as dened in (7.15). from the point of view of the worldvolume eld theory on
the d-brane, the characteristic class y(2
e, g) on the right-hand side of (7.83) measures
the topological charge of a gravitational/yang-mills instanton. from eq. (7.82) we see
that y  y can be thought of as the brane current for a fat d(p  m)-brane bound to
and spread out over the dp-brane. when the instanton shrinks to zero size, y acquires a
delta-function singularity, so that the quantity y  y behaves just like a brane current.
for some specic examples wherein the twisting of the normal bundle n(y, x) modies

the induced charge, see [35].

to write the class (7.83) in a more suggestive form, we make use of the thom isomor-

phism for cohomology in the form of eq. (7.24) and the identity

f!f  = d0   ,

104

(7.84)

q = f!ch(e)  ba(t y ) 

 ,

1

f qba(t x)

(7.83)

where   h #(x, z) and d0 is the poincare dual of the zero section. then we have

q = f!(cid:16)ch(e)  ba(t y )(cid:17) 

1

qba(t x)

.

(7.85)

now we apply the atiyah-hirzebruch version of the riemann-roch theorem [51] which

gives (see eq. (7.35))

f!(cid:16)ch(e)  ba(t y )(cid:17) = ch(f!e)  ba(t x) ,

where f![e]  k(x) is dened using the thom isomorphism (7.40). from (7.86) it
follows that, as an element of h #(x), the rr charge associated to a d-brane wrapping a
supersymmetric cycle in spacetime f : y  x with chan-paton bundle e  y is given
by

(7.86)

(7.87)

q = ch(f!e) qba(t x) .

the result (7.87) has a very natural k-theory interpretation using the chern isomorphism
(7.10). the cohomology rings k(x) z q and h even(x, q) both have natural inner
products dened on them. on h even(x, q), the bilinear form is given as in eq. (7.13),
while the pairing on k(x) is given by the index of the dirac operator (c.f. eq. (7.57)):

d[e] , [f ]ek

= index id/ ef

(7.88)

which using the atiyah-singer index theorem (7.58) may be written in terms of the der-
ham inner product as

this implies that the modied chern isomorphism

(cid:28)[e] , [f ](cid:29)k

=(cid:28)ch(e) qba(t x) , ch(f ) qba(t x)(cid:29)dr
[e] 7 ch(e) qba(t x)

.

(7.89)

(7.90)

is an isometry with respect to the natural inner products on k(x) and h #(x). thus,
the result (7.87) is in complete agreement with the fact that d-brane charge is given by
f![e]  k(x), and it moreover gives an explicit formula for the brane charges in terms of
the chern character homomorphism on k-theory. integrating (7.87) over suitable cycles
of the spacetime manifold x, as in (7.13), one thereby obtains the various p-brane charges
of the dp-brane.

this work was completed. r.j.s. would also like to thank the organisors and participants

of the pims/apctp/crm workshop particles, fields and strings 99, which was held
at the university of british columbia in summer 1999, for having provided a stimulating
environment in which to work. the work of r.j.s. was supported in part by the natural

sciences and engineering research council of canada.
