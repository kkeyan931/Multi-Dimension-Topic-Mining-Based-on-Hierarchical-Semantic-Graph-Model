abstract

the exact value (in the (1  2)2approximation) of the casimir energy of
a dilute dielectric ball is derived by making use of a simple and clear mode
summation method. the addition theorem for the bessel functions enables
one to carry out in a closed form the summation over the angular momentum
before the integration over the imaginary frequencies. the linear in (1  2)
terms in the vacuum energy are removed by appropriate subtraction. the role
of the contact terms used in other approaches to this problem is elucidated.

i. introduction

the progress in calculation of the casimir energy is rather slow. in his pioneer paper [1]
in 1948 h. b. g. casimir calculated the vacuum electromagnetic energy for the most simple
boundary conditions: for two parallel perfectly conducting plates placed in vacuum. when
taking into account the dielectric properties of the media separated by plane boundaries,
additional mathematical diculties do not appear [2]. however the rst result on the cal-
culation of the casimir energy for the nonat boundaries was obtained only in 1968. by
computer calculations during 3 years, t. h. boyer found the casimir energy of a perfectly
conducting spherical shell [3]. and only just recently the vacuum electromagnetic energy of
a dilute dielectric ball1 was calculated [610].

the methods used for calculating the casimir energy in the framework of the quantum
eld theory [11] can be classied as local or global ones. in the local approach the vacuum
expectation value of the tensor of the energymomentum density is expressed in terms of the
corresponding greens functions. upon integrating over the space, one arrives at the casimir
energy. in the global approach, the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian operator in the ground
state is represented as the half sum of all the eigenfrequencies of the eld under consideration
(as the sum of zeropoint energies of the relevant harmonic oscillators representing the initial
quantum eld).

either of these methods has own subtlepoints concerning the quantization of the elec-
tromagnetic eld in media with dispersion. as known, in this case the denition of the
energymomentum tensor is not unique (the minkowski tensor and the abraham tensor)
[12]. when calculating the casimir energy the choice between these two possibilities should
be done [13]. in the global approach one should be convinced that the imaginary part of
the dielectric constant, which is for sure nonzero in real media, does not lead to absorbation
of the virtual photons like the real ones. in other words, it is to be shown that the result of
summing the eigenfrequencies is a real quantity. it is worth noting that it is the case in all
the studies of the casimir eect carried out.

in both approaches, the divergences appear inevitably, and unfortunately till now there

are no general rules for their removing.

all the problems on the casimir energy calculations, considered by now, were solved, as
a rule, in the local and in the global approaches, the results being the same. however, for a
dielectric ball it is not the case.

in calculations of the vacuum electromagnetic energy of a dilute dielectric ball conducted
in papers [810] the greens functions have been used essentially and an important role was
played by the so called contact terms in the nal expression for the vacuum energy. as it is
directly followed from papers [6,8,13,14], these terms do not appear when proceeding from
the sum of the eigenfrequencies because they are outside the logarithm.

1the calculation of the casimir energy in a special case, when both the material media have the
same velocity of light, proves to be, from the mathematical stand point, exactly the same as for
perfectly conducting shells placed in vacuum and having the shape of the interface between these
media [4,5].

2

it is to be noted that the results of the casimir energy calculation for a dilute dielectric
ball, accomplished in the framework of the quantum eld theory [8,9], coincide with those
obtained by summing the van der waals interactions between individual molecules making
up the ball [6] and by applying a special perturbation theory, where the dielectric ball is
treated as an perturbation in a complete hamiltonian of electromagnetic eld in unbounded
empty space [7].

in this situation, the question naturally arises: how to calculate the casimir energy of
a dilute dielectric ball in the global approach or precisely how to do this by summing the
frequencies of electromagnetic oscillations in the problem at hand.

this point is also important due to the following consideration. from the mathematical
stand point, the most consistent method for treating the divergences in calculations of the
vacuum energy is the zeta regularization technique [15]. in this method, one proceeds from
the sum of the eigenfrequencies.

the analysis of the divergencies which can appear in calculation of the casimir energy
of a dielectric ball in the framework of the zeta function technique, has been carried out in
[16]. it was, in particular, shown that the heat kernel coecient a2, responsible for the pole
contribution to this casimir energy, proves to be proportional to (c1c2)3 for small dierence
c1  c2 (here c1 and c2 are the velocities of light inside and outside the ball, respectively). it
implies that, in the (c1c2)2approximation, the zeta renormalization technique should lead
to a nite answer in this problem. however, in ref. [16], the contact terms were certainly not
considered. therefore, without elucidating the role of these terms, the interrelation between
the results of papers [8,9] and of paper [16] is not absolutely clear.

the layout of this paper is as follows. in sect. ii the derivation of the integral represen-
tation for the vacuum energy is given by making use of the mode summation and contour
integration. the subtraction procedure that gives the renormalized casimir energy in the
n2approximation is discussed in detail as well as its physical justication. the addition
theorem for the bessel functions enables one to carry out the summation over the angular
momentum in a closed form. it leads to an exact (in the n2approximation) value of the
casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball. in the conclusion (sect. iii) the method proposed
here for calculating the casimir energy is briey discussed as well as the implication of the
obtained result concerning, specically, the elucidation of the role of the contact terms used
in other approaches to this problem. in the appendix the analysis of the divergencies in the
problem at hand is fulllled, that allows one to reveal an important relation between the
linear and quadratic in n contributions into the vacuum energy. it is this relation that
provides a simple and eective scheme of calculations which is followed in this paper.

ii. mode summation for vacuum electromagnetic energy of a

dilute dielectric ball

we shall consider a solid ball of radius a placed in an unbounded uniform medium.
the nonmagnetic materials making up the ball and its surroundings are characterized by
permittivity 1 and 2, respectively. it is assumed that the conductivity in both the media
is zero. the system of units is used where c = h = 1.

3

we shall proceed from the standard denition of the vacuum energy through the eigen-

frequencies of the electromagnetic oscillations [11]

e =

1

2 xs

(s  s) .

(2.1)

here s are the classical frequencies of the electromagnetic eld under the boundary con-
ditions described above, and the frequencies s correspond to a certain limiting boundary
conditions that will be specied below.

the sum (1/2)ps s in eq. (2.1) plays the same role as the counter terms in the standard

renormalization procedure in quantum eld theory [17]. however in the renormalizable
eld models considered in the unbounded minkowski spacetime, the explicit form of these
counter terms is known (at least, it is known the algorithm of their construction at each order
of perturbation theory). unlike this, there are no general rules for obtaining the terms that
should be subtracted when calculating the vacuum energy. therefore, in any new problem
on calculating the casimir energy one needs to specify the boundary conditions, determining
the frequencies s, a new, appealing to some physical considerations.

usually, it is enough to subtract in eq. (2.1) the vacuum energy of electromagnetic eld
for the conguration, when the interface between two media is removed to innity [11]. in
the problem at hand it implies the limit a  , i.e., the medium 1 tends to ll the entire
space. but it turns out that this subtraction is not sucient because the contributions into
the vacuum energy linear in 1  2 retain. further, we assume that the dierence 1  2
is small and content ourselves only with the (1  2)2terms.
the necessity to subtract the contributions into the vacuum energy linear in 1  2 is
justied by the following considerations. the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball can
be thought of as the net result of the van der waals interactions between the molecules
making up the ball [6]. these interactions are proportional to the dipole momenta of the
molecules, i.e., to the quantity (1  1)2. thus, when a dilute dielectric ball is placed in
the vacuum, then its casimir energy should be proportional to (1  1)2. it is natural to
assume that when such a dielectric ball is surrounded by an innite dielectric medium with
permittivity 2, then its casimir energy should be proportional to (1  2)2.

further, we put for safe of symmetry

1 = n1 = 1 +

n
2

, 2 = n2 = 1 

n
2

.

(2.2)

here n1 and n1 are the refractive indices of the ball and of its surroundings, respectively,
and it is assumed that n << 1. from here it follows, in particular, that

1  2 = (n1 + n2)(n1  n2) = 2n .

(2.3)

thus, when using the denition (2.1) we shall keep in mind that really two subtractions
should be done: rst the contribution, obtained in the limit a  , is to be subtracted and
then all the terms linear in n should also be removed.
we present the vacuum energy dened by eq. (2.1) in terms of the contour integral in
the complex frequency plane. the details of this procedure can be found in refs. [4,18].
upon the contour deformation one gets

for obtainng the nal result all the terms linear in n should be subtracted from eq. (2.9).
to this end it is convenient to rewrite eq. (2.9) in the form

the term e1 accounts for only the expression exp(2n y) in the argument of the logarithm
function in eq. (2.9).
it is worth nothing that the term e1 is exactly the value of the casimir energy considered
by schwinger in his attempt to explain the sonoluminescence [20]. really, introducing the
cuto ak for frequency integration and the cuto y = /a for the angular momentum
summation we arrive at the result

(2.15)

we have substituted here the summation over l by integration. up to the multiplier (1/3)
it is exactly the schwinger value for the casimir energy of a bubble (1 = 1) in water
(2  4/3) [13].
in order to obtain the renormalized vacuum energy eren, we have to subtract from eq.
(2.10) all the terms linear in n, i.e., e1 and those which are generated by the function w 2
l
in e2. how to do this, staying in the framework of the mode summation method, is shown
in the appendix.

in our calculation, we content ourselves with the n2approximation. hence, in eq.
l (y, y) and keep in expansion of the logarithm function
l and p 2
l

(2.12) one can put p 2
l (n1y, n2y)  p 2
only the terms proportional to n2. in this approximation, the contributions of w 2
into the vacuum energy are additive

eren = ew + ep .

(2.16)

in the appendix it is shown that for obtaining the n2contribution into the casimir energy
of the function w 2
in the argument of the logarithm in eq. (2.12), it is sucient to calculate
l
the n2contribution of the function w 2
l alone changing the sign of this contribution to the
opposite one. hence,

(2.18)

usually, when calculating the vacuum energy in the problem with spherical symmetry, the
uniform asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions is used [19]. as a result, an approx-
imate value of the casimir energy can be derived, the accuracy of which depends on the
number of terms preserved in the asymptotic expansion.

we shall persist in other way. by making use of the addition theorem for the bessel
functions [19], we rst do the summation over the angular momentum l in eq. (2.12) and
only then we will integrate over the imaginary frequency y. as a result, we obtain an exact
(in the n2approximation) value of the casimir energy in the problem involved.

so, we further need the following addition theorem for the bessel functions [19]

0 (y, y), respectively. as it

was stipulated before, we have to keep in eq. (2.23) only the terms proportional to n2
and in eq. (2.24) we have put n = 0.

the calculation of the contribution ep to the casimir energy is straighforward. upon
dierentiation of the righthanded side of eq. (2.24) with respect to y, the integration over
dr can be done here. substitution of this result into eq. (2.18) gives

in the nal result in eq. (2.27) only the rst term is to be left. the linear in n term

the terms proportional to n3 and n1 lead to the divergencies of the same type as the
(1/2) term in the square brakets in eq. (2.25). this also concerns the term e2n n in eq.
(2.23). all these innite contributions should be dropped. thus, we are left with the result

2this divergence has the same origin as those arising in summation over l when the uniform
asymptotic expansions of the bessel functions are used [8,9]. the technique employed here is close
to the multiple scattering expansion [21], where these divergencies are also subtracted.

(2.30)

at rst, this value for the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball has been derived in
ref. [6] by summing the van der waals interactions between individual molecules making
up the ball. in the paper [7] this value was obtained by treating a dilute dielectric ball as a
perturbation in the complete hamiltonian of the electromagnetic eld for this conguration.
in papers [8,9], the result close to the exact value (2.30) has been obtained by employing
the uniform asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions.

in ref. [4] the estimation of the casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball has been done
taking into account, as it is seen now, only the second term in eq. (2.29). and nevertheless
it was not so bad having the accuracy about 35%.

iii. conclusions

in this paper the exact (in the n2approximation) value of the casimir energy of a
dilute dielectric ball is derived in the framework of the quantum eld theory. the starting
point is the mode summation by making use of the contour integration in the complex
frequency plane. unlike the other approaches to this problem, we do not use the uniform
asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions.

the key point in our consideration is employment of the addition theorem for the bessel
functions which enables us to do the summation over the angular momentum values in a
closed form. as a by-product, it is shown that the role of the contact terms, at least in the
n2approximation, consists only in removing the linear in n contributions to the casimir
energy. they do not contribute to the nite value of this energy. remarkably, that the eect
of the contact terms can be reproduced by a standard subtraction procedure, staying in the
framework of the mode summation technique.

the terms quadratic in n in eq. (a13) exactly reproduce the function fl(y) in eq. (9) of
the paper [8]. it is this function that aords the whole nite value of the casimir energy in
the problem under consideration. thus the contact terms merely cancel the terms aln in
eq. (a13). however, such a subtraction can also be accomplished in the framework of the
mode summation method by substitution of eq. (a13) by

where w

l = 1 + aln.

in view of all this, we now have the following scheme for calculating the casimir energy
in the n2approximation in the problem under consideration. first, the n2contribution
l . upon changing its sign to the opposite
one, we obtain the contribution generated by w 2
l , when this function is in the argument of
the logarithm. obviously, this result would be deduced directly if one could nd in a closed

should be nd, which is given by the sum pl w 2
form the sum pl w 2

finally, we make a short comment concerning the contribution into the casimir energy
which is linear in n. by making use of the uniform asymptotic expansion for the riccati
bessel functions [14] in eq. (a8), the sum of the al terms in eq. (a13) can be represented
in the form

l w 2
l

[22].

(a15)

this implies, in particular, that the zeta function technique does not give here a nite result
in contradiction with the conclusion made in ref. [16].
