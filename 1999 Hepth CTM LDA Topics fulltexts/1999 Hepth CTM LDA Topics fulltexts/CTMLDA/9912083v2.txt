we nd the most general low energy dynamics of 1/2 bps monopoles in the n =

4 supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theories when all six adjoint higgs expectation

values are turned on. when only one higgs is turned on, the lagrangian is purely

kinetic. when all the rest ve are turned on a little bit, however, this moduli space

dynamics is augmented by ve independent potential terms, each in the form of half

the squared norm of a killing vector eld on the moduli space. a generic stationary

conguration of the monopoles can be interpreted as stable non bps dyons, previously

found as nonplanar string webs connecting d3-branes. the supersymmetric extension

is also found explicitly, and gives the complete quantum mechanics of monopoles in

n = 4 sym theory.

1 introduction

recently new stable solitons in yang-mills theories were constructed, whose electric charges and

magnetic charges are not proportional to each other. these new solitons exist only when more

than one adjoint higgs elds are involved, so are natural in yang-mills theories with extended

supersymmetry. their classical aspects have been studied in the context of n = 4 supersymmetric

yang-mills theories [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. of these dyons, some preserve 1/4 of n = 4 supersymmetry,

and thus are known as 1/4 bps dyons, while others do not preserve any supersymmetry at all.

it is also well known that the supersymmetric yang-mills theories arise as a low energy

description of parallel d3 branes in the type iib string theory [7]. in this context, dyons arise as

string webs ending on d3 branes. for instance, more traditional 1/2 bps monopoles and dyons are

represented by straight (p, q) string segments ending on a pair of d3 branes, while a 1/4 bps dyon

corresponds to a properly oriented, planar web of strings ending on more than two d3 branes[8].

the stable non-bps states are realized as the most general form of string web, which is typically

nonplanar. some non-bps dyons can be thought of as deformation of 1/4 bps dyons which results

as d3 positions themselves get moved and become nonplanar in the six transverse directions. (a

numerical study of such non bps dyons as a eld theory conguration has been performed within

spherically symmetric ansatz and the resulting brane congurations were found to agree with that

of the type iib string theory[6]. )

the detail of the 1/4 bps eld congurations has been explored in ref. [1]. the bps

equations satised by these eld congurations consist of two pieces: one is the old magnetic bps

equation for some 1/2 bps monopole conguration while the other is a covariant laplace equation

for the additional higgs eld in the 1/2 bps monopole background. because of this two-tier

structure of the bps equations, the parameter space of a 1/4 bps dyon is identical to the moduli

space of the rst, magnetic bps equations. the only subtlety here is that some of the monopole

parameters transmute to classical electric charges, as we compare the two.

the main lesson we learn from this fact is that the nonrelativistic dynamics that incorporates

1/4 bps dyonic states can be formulated as that of dynamics on the same old monopole moduli

space but with new interactions. this is true, at least when the monopole rest mass is dominant

over the electric part of the energy. the kinetic term of the modied eective lagrangian is given

1

by the moduli space metric of the underlying 1/2 bps monopoles, while the potential term comes

from the additional higgs eld and is found to be a half of the squared norm of a killing vector.

the eective lagrangian have a bps bound of its own. classically and quantum mechanically, the

1/4 bps dyons arise as specic bound states that saturate such a low energy bps bound. this

new dynamics incorporates the 1/4 bps dyons as well as more traditional 1/2 bps monopoles and

dyons.

there have been a couple of derivations of this eective low energy lagrangian of monopoles

that produces 1/4 bps dyonic congurations. the rst such derivation relied on the relation

between the bps energy of 1/4 bps congurations and the conserved electric charges [9]. the

trick here is to realize that the bps energy can be estimated in two dierent ways. one from the

eld theory, and the other from realizing 1/4 bps states as a bound state of monopoles in the

low energy sense. by comparing the former, exact, formula to the latter, one can in fact identify

the form of the potential term as one half of the electric part of the bps energy, expressed in

terms of higgs expectation values and monopole moduli space geometry. the resulting potential

is exact within the nonrelativistic approximation. the potential leads to the long range attraction

or repulsion between dyons [10].

shortly thereafter, there appeared an alternate derivation by two of the authors [11]. here,

the eld theoretic lagrangian is calculated for a given initial eld data, which are made of 1/4 bps

conguration and its eld velocity. the lagrangian, after integrated over the space, turns out to

give the sum of minus rest mass and the kinetic parts which consists of quadratic and also linear

terms in velocity of moduli coordinates. this is somewhat similar to the consideration of the zero

mode dynamics of a particle with nonzero momentum. after shifting the cyclic coordinates related

to conserved electric charges, one gets the low energy lagrangian including the potential energy.

in both of the previous derivations, the 1/4 bps dyons were used as the convenient stepping

stone that leads to the above low energy lagrangian. however, the dynamics is really that of

monopoles, which naturally produces 1/4 bps dyons as bound states. the eective lagrangian

was successfully understood because the states therein were understood very well by other means.

this funny state of aairs begs for a question whether there exists a more fundamental derivation

of the dynamics based only on the properties of 1/2 bps monopoles.

as we will see, there is indeed such a derivation. in particular, since the method does not rely

2

on bps properties of monopole bound states, it is applicable to situations where bound states are

typically non bps. such outcomes are generic when more than two higgs take independent vacuum

expectation values. in fact, we are going to nd the exact low energy lagrangian when all six higgs

are turned on. on the other hand, note that the low energy dynamics is meaningful only when

the kinetic and the potential energies are much smaller than the rest mass of the monopoles [9].

because of this, one combination of higgs eld must be chosen to be large, so that monopoles have

rest masses much larger than the electric and the kinetic part of energy. this separates six higgs

into one with large expectations and ve remaining ones with small and independent expectation

values.

in this new derivation, the 1/2 bps monopole congurations are primary and of order one. as

we take the expectation values of the additional ve higgs elds to be small, we take them to be of

order  << 1 quantities, where  characterizes the ratio of the additional higgs expectation values

to the rst higgs which shows up in magnetic bps equation. we then solve the eld equation

for the ve additional higgs elds classically to the leading order in , given a static monopole

background. the problem again reduces to a second order laplace equation for each of ve higgs.

we put the result back into the eld theory lagrangian to obtain the potential term as a function

of higgs expectations. of course, independently of this, we also consider slow motions of monopoles

and derive the kinetic term as well. the resulting action is accurate to the order, 2 and v2 where

v is the typical monopole velocity.

the modied eective lagrangian is again based on the monopole moduli space, since, to

the leading order, the above two computations of kinetic and potential terms, do not interfere with

each other. in particular, the kinetic term is given by the same moduli space metric. the potential

is now half the sum of squared norms of ve killing vectors. these ve killing vector elds are

picked out by the ve additional and small higgs expectation values. for generic but small vevs

of these ve higgs, even the lowest energy conguration with generic electric charges is non bps.

the view we take here is similar to the method of obtaining the coulomb potential between

two massive point particles. in that case, we consider the limit the electric coupling e is small and

the velocity v of charged particles is small. then, the leading solution of the maxwell equation is

coulombic. to the order v2 + e2, the lagrangian is the standard kinetic energy with the coulomb

potential. the retarded or relativistic eects would be of order v2e2, v4 and, thus, negligible.

3

recall that the planar string web for the 1/4 bps dyonic congurations are made of the webs

of fundamental strings and d strings. the key cause for the web is the attractive force between

fundamental and d strings. for the 1/4 bps supersymmetry, the orientation of the each string

vertex should be consistent. in dyonic picture, the 1/4 bps congurations correspond to dyons

in nite separation with the delicate balance between higgs force and electromagnetic force. they

appear naturally as the bps conguration for the low energy dynamics. thus they are the lowest

energy congurations for a given set of the electric charge, which characterizes the bps energy. in

the non bps case, again the non planar string webs are formed from the fundamental strings and

d strings. in the low energy lagrangian, they would correspond to the lowest energy conguration

for the given set of electric charges, which could not saturate the bps energy bound.

the supersymmetric completion of the low energy dynamics should have eight real super-

charges. for the cases with one higgs expectation and two higgs expectations, the supersymmetric

low energy dynamics are known [12, 9, 13]. the former is completely determined by the monopole

moduli space metric, which happens to be hyperkahler, while the latter also involves additional

potential determined by a single linear combination of triholomorphic killing vector eld on the

moduli space. when all six higgs elds are involved, the low energy dynamics involve up to ve lin-

early independent combinations of such killing vectors. the nal goal of this paper is to write down

this supersymmetric low energy lagrangian explicitly4, which completes the low energy interaction

of monopoles in n = 4 yang-mills theory, to the extent that the nonrelativistic approximation

makes sense.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in sec. 2, we review the 1/2 bps monopoles and the

1/4 bps equations. in sec. 3, we derive the eective lagrangian for the non bps congurations.

in sec. 4, we explore this lagrangian. in sec. 5, we nd the supersymmetric completion of the

lagrangian. in sec. 6, we conclude with some remarks.

4 the supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be obtained as the dimensional reduction of the six dimen-
sional (0,8) supersymmetric sigma model [14] to a one dimensional quantum mechanics, by the scherk-schwarz
mechanism[15]. this suggests that the form of the supersymmetric lagrangian is the most general nonlinear sigma
model with eight real supercharges.

4

2 bps bound and primary bps equation

we begin with the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. we choose the compact semi-simple

group g of the rank r. we divide the six higgs elds into b and ai with i = 1, ..., 5. the bosonic

part of the lagrangian is given by

l =



1

2 z d3x trne2 + (d0b)2 + (d0ai )2o
2 z d3x tr(b2 + (db)2 + (dai )2 + (i[ai , b])2 + xi<j

1

(i[ai , aj ])2) ,

(1)

where d0 = 0  ia0, d =   ia, and e = 0a  da0. the four vector potential (a0, a) =
0t a, aat a) and the group generators t a are traceless hermitian matrices such that tr t at b = ab.
(aa

as shown in ref. [1], there is a bps bound on the energy functional, which is saturated only

when congurations satisfy

b = db ,

e = ci dai ,

d0b  i[ci ai , b] = 0 ,
d0ci ai = 0 ,

together with the gauss law,

d  e  i[b, d0b]  i[ci ai , d0ci ai ] = 0 .

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

where ci is a unit vector in ve dimensions. in addition, the rest of the higgs eld should be trivial

on this conguration, or

d0(ai  ci cj aj ) = 0
d(ai  ci cj aj ) = 0
[b, ai  ci cj aj ] = 0 .

this condition implies the 1/4 bps conguration should be planar. the bps energy is then

z = b  g + ci ai  q ,

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

where b and ai are vacuum expectation values of the higgs elds, while g and q are magnetic and

electric charges respectively.

5

equation (2) is the old bps equation for 1/2 bps monopoles and is called the primary bps

equation. the bps bound is saturated if the additional equations are satised. for 1/4 bps

congurations, the additional equations are from the energy bound and the gauss law, which are

put into a single equation,

d2ci ai  [b, [b, ci ai ]] = 0,

(11)

which is called the secondary bps equation. in addition, the ai  ci cj aj which is orthogonal to
ci vector should commute with all other elds and constant in space time. one last step necessary
to solve for the 1/4 bps dyon is to put a0 = ci ai .

in the type iib string realization of u (n ) yang-mills theories, the above bps equations

imply that the corresponding 1/4 bps string web lies on a plane. however, the d3 branes which

are not connected to the web do not need to lie on the plane. even when d3 branes lie on a

single plane, one can nd planar string webs which is not bps as the orientations of the string

junctions are not uniform. in this paper, we consider the special class of non bps congurations

which correspond the non planar web, which would have been 1/4 bps congurations when we put

d3 branes to a single plane by small deformations of their positions. in addition, we consider the

string web is almost linear. for this case, we do not need to solve the full quadratic eld equations.

we consider an approximation by considering the quantity

to be much smaller than unity, throughout this paper.

  |ai|
|b|

,

(12)

within such approximation, we may solve the eld equation in two steps. first one solve the

rst-order, magnetic bps equation. once this is done, the solution of this primary bps equation

describes the collection of 1/2 bps monopoles, and the higgs eld b takes the form

b  b  h 

g  h
4r

,

(13)

asymptotically, where h is the cartan subalgebra. we are interested in the case where the ex-

pectation value b breaks the gauge group g maximally to abelian subgroups u (1)r. then, there
exists a unique set of simple roots 1, 2, ..., r such that a b > 0 [16]. the magnetic and electric
charges are given by

r

g = 4

naa,

xa=1

6

(14)

where integer na  0. for each simple root a, there exist a fundamental monopole of magnetic
charge 4a/e, which comes with four bosonic zero modes: the integer na can be thought of as

the number of the a fundamental monopoles. the moduli space of such 1/2 bps congurations

has the dimension of 4pa na. we will consider the case where all na are positive so that the

monopoles do not separate into mutually noninteracting subgroups.

let us denote the moduli space coordinates by zm. if we parameterize bps monopole solu-

tions by the moduli coordinate zs, a(x, zm) = (a(x, zm), b(x, zm)) with  = 1, 2, 3, 4, the zero

modes are in general of the form,

ma =

a
zm + dm,

(15)

where dm = m  i[a, m] with understanding 4 = 0. the zero modes around the 1/2 bps
congurations are determined by perturbed primary bps equation plus a gauge xing condition,

d  ma = mb  i[ma, b],
dma = 0,

(16)

(17)

which forces the actual zero modes to be a sum of two terms. given this denition of zero modes,

one can dene a natural metric on the moduli space spanned by the collective coordinate zs

[17, 18, 12],

with such a metric, the lagrangian (1) for the monopoles of the primary bps equation can be

gmn(z) = z d3x tr mama.

(18)

expanded for small velocities as,

where the rst term is the rest mass of the monopoles,

l = g  b + l +  ,

g  b =

1

2z d3x tr nb2 + (db)2o .

(19)

(20)

ignoring the other ve higgs elds, the low energy dynamics that actually dictates the motion of

these 1/2 bps congurations would be given by the purely kinetic, nonrelativistic lagrangian

l =

1
2

gmn(z) zm zn .

(21)

as there are r unbroken global u (1) symmetries, the corresponding electric charges should
be conserved. in other words, l should have r cyclic coordinates corresponding to these gauge

7

transformations. in particular, we can choose a basis such that a cyclic coordinate is denoted by

a (a = 1, ..., r) corresponds to the center of mass phase of monopoles of a root. in geometrical
terms, the cyclic coordinates as generate killing vectors,

finally, let us divide the moduli coordinates zm to a and the rest yi, upon which the lagrangian

ka 


a .

(22)

(21) can be rewritten as

l =

1
2

hij(y) yi yj +

1
2

lab(y)( a + wa

i (y) yi)( b + wb

j (y) yj) ,

which denes the quantities h, l, and ws. in particular,

notice that all metric components are independent of a.

lab = gmnk m

a k n
b .

3 additional higgs and monopole dynamics

(23)

(24)

let us now explore the low energy dynamics of monopoles when additional higgs elds, ai , are

turned on. when expectation values ai are turned on, the monopole solutions of the primary bps

equation are not, in general, solutions to the full eld equations. monopoles exert static forces on

other monopoles. for suciently small ai , these forces arise from the extra potential energy due

to nontrivial ai elds; the combined eect of ai and of the monopole background induce some

nontrivial behavior to ai , which dresses the monopoles and contributes to the energy of the

system.

to nd this potential, we imagine a static conguration of monopoles, which are held xed

by some external force. let us try to dress it with a time-independent ai eld with the smallest

possible cost of energy. the energy functional for such ai elds is

e =

1

2 z d3x tr n(dai )2 + (i [ai , b ])2o ,

(25)

to the leading order where we ignore terms of higher power in , such as [ ai , aj ]2. we can nd the

minimal dressing eld ai by solving the second order equation,

d2ai  [b, [b, ai ]] = 0.

8

(26)

solving this for ai and inserting them back into the energy functional above, we should nd the

minimal cost of energy for the static monopole conguration.

the same type of the second order equation appeared in construction of 1/4 bps dyons,

where the projected higgs eld ci ai obey such an equation. however, we must emphasize that we

are performing a very dierent task here. specically, in the construction of 1/4 bps dyons, bps
equations force ci ai to be identied with the time-component gauge eld, a0, which determines
electric charges. here we are simply solving for the reaction of the scalar elds ai to the given

monopole conguration.

using tongs trick[19], we notice that dai and i[b, ai ] can be thought of as global gauge
zero modes, dai , which satisfy the gauge xing condition, ddai = 0. thus, dai can be

regarded as a linear combination of gauge zero modes, and subsequently each ai picks out a linear

combination of u (1) killing vector elds on the moduli space, which are

k m
a



zm

=


a

.

more precisely, each ka corresponds to a gauge zero mode,

and each dai is a linear combination of them,

k m

a ma,

dai = aa

i k m

a ma,

(27)

(28)

(29)

when we expand the asymptotic value ai = pa aaa, where as are the fundamental weights
such that a  b = ab.

we then express the potential energy v, obtained by minimizing the functional e in eq. (25)

in the monopole background, in terms of the monopole moduli parameters as

v =

2 z d3x tr n(aa

i k m

a ma)(ab

i k n

bna)o =

1
2

gmn aa

i k m

a ab

i k n
b.

(30)

the value of this potential depends on the monopole conguration we started with, which induces

the static force on monopoles. the low energy eective lagrangian was purely kinetic when ai

were absent. in the presence of ai s and of their expectation values ai , however, the lagrangian

picks up a potential term,

l =

1
2

gmn zm zn  v

9

(31)

which can be written more explicitly as,

l =

(32)

where the index i runs from 1 to 5, and labels the ve potential terms.

the procedure we employed here should be a very familiar one. when we talk about, say,

coulombic interaction between charged particles, we also x the charge distribution by hand, and

then estimate the potential energy it costs. of course, there is a possibility of more interaction terms

involving velocities of moduli as well as ai elds, but in the low energy approximation here, the

only relevant terms of such kind would be of order v. however, it is clear that neither backreaction

of ai to the magnetic background nor the time-dependence of ai s can produce such a term. thus,

to the leading quadratic order in v and , the above lagrangian captures all bosonic interactions

among monopoles in the presence of ais.5

4 1/4 bps and non bps congurations

the total energy of the eld conguration within this nonrelativistic approximation is then

where the nonrelativistic energy is derived from l, and can be written as

e = b  g + e ,

e =

gmn(z)(cid:16) zm zn + aa

(33)

(34)

the energy e has a bps bound of its own. with an arbitrary ve dimensional unit vector ci , we
can rewrite the energy as

(35)

5while the low energy dynamics turns out to be quite simple, there is a subtlety in reconstructing the actual eld
conguration for a given low energy motion on the moduli space. for the magnetic part of the conguration, a,
the trajectory on moduli space can be represented reliably by allowing time-dependence of the moduli parameters.
namely, the time-dependent eld conguration would be a = a(x; zm(t)) where a(x; z) is the solution of the
primary bps equation. for the additional higgs elds, however, the naive ansatz ai = ai (x; zm(t)) does not work,
where ai (x; zm) solves the static second order equation (26) in the background of a(x; z). such an ansatz would
involve uctuations of nonnormalizable modes, as ai has a zm-dependent 1/r tail. rather, the time-dependence of
ai eld has much nicer large r behavior, and this can be seen easily by solving the full eld equation for ai order by
order in v.

(40)

quantum counterpart of such bps congurations have been explored in ref. [13]. in eld theory

terms, these bps states of low energy dynamics preserve 1/4 of eld theory supersymmetries.

these 1/4 bps congurations describe static dyons spreading out in space such that the

electromagnetic force and the higgs force are in delicate balance. they are the bps congurations

of the low energy eective action when, in eect, only one linear combination of the killing vector

elds, ci aa

i ka, is relevant. for more general cases, when ai cannot be taken to be zero, the
bps bound are not saturated. nevertheless, there must exist the lowest energy state with any

given charge, which would correspond to stable non bps states. (these non bps congurations

correspond to the string web which is not planar.) such a stable dyonic conguration can be found

classically considering the nonrelativistic energy functional.

congurations which are static in yi and satisfy

(44)

in general the family of stable solutions yi for a given qa, if they exist, will form a submanifold of

the moduli space. however, it is not clear whether there will be always qa satisfying eq. (44) for

some yi. in fact, it is known that for some case with too large values of qa there is no solution to

such equations[1].

the general analysis of eq. (44) will be complicated. one case where it can be solved explicitly

is when the magnetic background contains only one fundamental monopole of each kind; that is,

suppose that, for each simple root a, a = 1, ..., r, we have one fundamental monopole at xa and

with the u (1) phase a. denote the relative position vectors between adjacent (in the lie algebra
sense) monopoles by ra = xa+1  xa for a = 1, ..., r  1 and also dene the corresponding relative
phases by a. for the phases, the redenition is such that the charges qa, associated with a, is
related to qas by qa = qa+1  qa. the metric is then decomposed into two decoupled pieces[20];

once this is satised,

ra = 0 solves the equations of motion, so the solution describes static

congurations of many distinct monopoles, each dressed by the electric charges. they corresponds

to stable non bps dyons in the eld theoretic description.

by inserting (53) to the eective potential (49), the energy of the conguration is determined

as a function of the monopole positions. the latter u (1) charge is not determined by moduli

parameters. it should be remarked that these states become 1/4 bps, when only one higgs vacuum

expectation value out of ve is nonvanishing or all the directions of them are parallel with each

other.

5 supersymmetric extension

so far we have concentrated on the bosonic part of the low energy eective lagrangian in the moduli

space approximation. the supersymmetric extension of the bosonic action can be achieved in two

dierent routes. a direct approach is to follow the same strategy of the bosonic part. namely,

identify rst the moduli uctuations and their coordinates of the fermionic part, and integrate out

all the other uctuation except the monopole moduli variables using the original eld theoretic

lagrangian.

while such a derivation would be more desirable, the symmetry of the system seems to oer

us a shortcut and allow us to x the susy completion of the eective lagrangian uniquely. we

shall follow the latter approach here.

since the background congurations of monopoles preserves half of the 16 supersymmetries

of the original n =4 sym theory, the quantum mechanics should have four complex, or eight real

supercharges, furthermore, the low energy eective theory should be consistent with the so(6)

r-symmetry of the four dimensional n =4 sym theory. out of six higgs elds, we picked out one,

b, associated with construction of monopoles, so only so(5) subgroup of so(6) may show up. for

instance, when we consider the extreme case of ai = 0, the susy quantum mechanics must have

full so(5) r-symmetry.

the additional higgs expectations ai break the remaining so(5) rotational symmetry of the

eld theory, as well, spontaneously. on the other hand, in the low energy dynamics of monopoles,

ai are small parameters, so the breaking of so(5) is explicit and soft. thus, so(5) is not a

symmetry of the low energy dynamics. nevertheless, because all ai are on an equal footing (unlike

b), the low energy dynamics must remain invariant when we rotate the ai in addition to rotating

dynamical degrees of freedom. thus, although this so(5) is not a symmetry of the low energy

theory in the conventional sense, this provides us with an interesting consistency checkpoint. later

we will nd and write down this so(5) transformation explicitly.

existence of the four complex supercharges is already quite restrictive. the supersymmetry

requires the geometry to be hyperkahler, to begin with, equipped with three complex structures

14

that satisfy

i (s)i (t) = st + stui (u),
dmi (s)n

p = 0 .

(54)

(55)

in the absence of ai s, the dynamics would be a sigma model onto the hyperkahler moduli space

of monopoles. the bosonic potential introduced by ai s can be rewritten in terms of ve triholo-
morphic killing vector elds, gi  ai  k, as
xi=1

i gmn.

alvarez-gaume and freedman [21] discussed how such killing vector elds can be incorpo-

rated into supersymmetric lagrangian while maintaining four complex supercharges in the two-

dimensional context. in this two-dimensional setting, they showed that up to four triholomorphic

killing vectors can be accommodated. this result presumably has something to do with the fact

that the supersymmetric lagrangian can also be obtained via the scherk-schwarz dimensional

reduction[15] from the six dimensional (0,8) nonlinear sigma model action presented in ref. [14].

since we are considering quantum mechanics instead of two-dimensional eld theory, this

suggests to us that one should be able to incorporate up to ve such killing vectors to the eective

lagrangian. thus, generalizing their result to quantum mechanics, we obtain the following unique

supersymmetric completion of the low energy dynamics,

 and s = ii (s)m

s = 1, 2, 3.

the supersymmetry algebra by itself requires some properties of gi s, in addition to hy-

perkahler properties of gmn. gi must satisfy

dmgin + dngim = 0 ,

(58)

or equivalently lgi g = 0, that is, gi must be a killing vector. in addition, the rotated version
(i (s)gi )ms must also satisfy

dm(i (s)gi )n  dn(i (s)gi )m = 0

(59)

15

taken together with the killing properties of gi and the closedness of the kahler forms, this also

implies that gi are triholomorphic,

of course, for the specic case of monopole dynamics, these two conditions are satised because

each ka is a triholomorphic killing vector eld on the moduli space. one last requirement on gi s

lgii (s) = 0

(60)

from susy algebra is,

i i (s)
gm

mn gn

j = 0.

(61)

for s = 1, 2, 3. this condition is met for triholomorphic gi s, provided that the commutators

vanish, [gi , gj ] = 0. since kas all commute among themselves, this last condition is also satised

in the above low energy dynamics of monopoles.

when quantized, the spinors e = ee

mm with vielbein ee

m, commute with all the bosonic

dynamical variables, especially with ps that are canonical momenta of the coordinates zs. the

remaining fundamental commutation relations are

[zm, pn] = im
n ,
{e

 , f

 } = ef  .

(62)

(consequently, the bosonic momenta ps do not commute with m.) it is straightforward to show

that the lagrangian (57) is invariant under the n=4 supersymmetry transformations,

(0)zm = m,
(0)m = i zm0  m
(s)zm = (s)(i (s))m,

where  and (s) are spinor parameters and no summation convention is used for the index s = 1, 2, 3.

for the supercharges, let us rst dene supercovariant momenta by

it is straightforward to see that the so(5) rotation is realized by the transformation,

where kl is antisymmetric in its indices and the corresponding generators, jkl ( = jlk), denote

jab = abc i (c) ,

j45 = i2 ,

j4a = 1 i (a) ,

j5a = 3 i (a)

with a, b, c = 1, 2, 3. for example, the transformation reads explicitly

m
  cos  m

when only 41 = 14 =  is nonvanishing.

(74)

(75)

performing such so(5) rotations, we obtain a theory with the vacuum expectation values
ai = rij aj where rij is the corresponding so(5) rotation matrix satisfying rtr = i. more
specically, the induced transformation of gi that is linear in the vacuum expectation value ai, is

gi  (cid:16)ekljkl(cid:17)ij

gj

(76)

where (jkl)ij = 1
2 (ki lj kj li ). when all ai are parallel with each other, one may make only
one higgs expectation value nonvanishing by an appropriate so(5) rotations; the result corresponds

to 1/4 bps eective lagrangian in ref. [1].

the ten generators of so(5) in (74) exhaust all the possible covariantly constant, antisymmet-

ric structures present in the n=4 supersymmetric sigma model without potential, so the realization

of the r-symmetry is rather unique.

the complex form of the supercharges are often useful. for this, we introduce m  12

the supercharges q(s) and q(s) are found similarly from (67). finally, {q, q} = {q(s), q(s)} =
h, so the hamiltonian is positive denite. all the central charges appear in other parts of the
algebra.

in ref. [13], the quantum 1/4 bps wavefunctions have been constructed explicitly and the

structure of the supermultiplet are identied. this construction has heavily relied upon the bps

nature of the states which rst order equations. this kind of simplication does not occur in the

case of the stable non bps states, so we will leave the analysis of their wavefunctions for future

works.

6 conclusion

we have found the complete supersymmetric lagrangian for the low energy dynamics of 1/2

monopoles when all six adjoint higgs elds get expectation values. we consider the nonrela-

tivistic dynamics of monopoles, which constrains the ve additional higgs to be small compared

the rst that gives mass to the monopoles. the bosonic part of the eective dynamics is found by

a perturbative expansion of elds around purely magnetic monopole congurations, which agrees

with previously found exact lagrangian when only two higgs elds, one large and another small,

are involved. the supersymmetric extension is constructed and argued to be unique, given the four

complex supercharges, and an would-be so(5) r-symmetry that is softly broken by ve killing

potential terms.

the dyonic state from the low energy dynamics would correspond to a web of strings ending

on d3 branes, when realized as type iib string theory congurations. this is possible for all classical

gauge groups of the yang-mills theory. when the transverse positions of the d3 branes are planar,

only one of the ve killing vectors become relevant, and the state saturate a bps bound which is

18

linearly characterized by the values of electric charges. these are 1/4 bps dyons in the eld theory

sense.

for a non planar distribution of d3 branes, on the other hand, at least two of the ve killing

vectors are relevant. the resulting non planar web does not saturate a bps bound, but exist as

a stable dyonic state. the state will consist of several distinct monopoles, each dressed with some

electric charges that are mostly determined by the inter-monopole separations. for a simple case,

we gave a set of algebraic equations that can be used to determine the charge-position relationship.

we have not fully explored the low energy eective lagrangian even classically. it is expected

that there exists a clear correspondence between the energy of non planar string web and the

minimum energy of the stable but non bps states. the energy of the string web in an appropriate

limit can be determined as sum of each length multiplied by tension. the detailed comparison

will be of interest. it would be interesting to nd out the eld theoretic conguration for these

dyonic non bps congurations. the quantum mechanics of the supersymmetric lagrangian is more

involved than that of ref. [13], which considered only one killing potential. nevertheless it is of

some interest to nd the ground state for the given electric charges.
