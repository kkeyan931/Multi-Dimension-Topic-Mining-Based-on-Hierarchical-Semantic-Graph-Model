the innite dimensional generalization of the quantum mechanics of extended objects, namely,
the quantum eld theory of extended objects is presented. the paradigm example studied in this
paper is the euclidean scalar eld with a  
interaction in four spacetime dimensions. the theory
is found to be nite when the virtual particle intermediate states are characterized by fuzzy particles
instead of ordinary pointlike particles. causality, lorentz invariance, and unitarity (veried up to
fourth order in the coupling constant) are preserved in the theory. in addition, the kallen-lehmann
spectral representation for the propagator is discussed.

i. introduction

the necessity to incorporate the nite extent or fuzziness of a quantum particle into our description of the world
and the resulting quantum mechanics have been presented by the author [1]. in the extended object formulation we
have noncanonical commutation relations of the form

[xfi, pj ] = iep 2/m2

ij and [xf0, p0] = iep 2

0 /m2

.

(1.1)

where xf is the noncommuting position operator and p 2 = pip i. in terms of euclidean momenta we can write the
commutation relations as

(cid:2)xf , p(cid:3) = iep 2/m2

g

(1.2)

where p is the euclidean 4-momentum, and g = (1, 1, 1, 1) is the euclidean metric and p 2 is a euclidean scalar.
the commutation relations in eq. (1.2) have a smooth limit with ordinary quantum mechanics as the compton
wavelength 1
m of the particle vanishes. our goal is to understand the innite dimensional generalization of the
quantum mechanics based on these commutation relations, namely, the quantum eld theory of extended objects.
the characterization of intermediate states by fuzzy particles obeying the commutation relations in eq. (1.2) becomes
important in rendering nite, hitherto nonrenormalizable theories because the troublesome vertex which causes these
divergences is eectively smeared out. in this paper we restrict ourselves to the simple case of the euclidean scalar eld
with a  6
interaction which has been found to be nonrenormalizable when approached via the quantum eld theory
6!
of point particles. we choose to construct the eld theory in euclidean space for convenience. the generalization of
the commutation relations in eq. (1.2) to continuous systems (elds) and the subsequent development of the theory
leads to a euclidean momentum space propagator which can render the interacting eld theory nite to all orders.
the theory is found to obey causality and lorentz invariance, and unitarity is demonstrated up to fourth order in
the coupling constant. in addition, the kallen-lehmann spectral representation for the propagator is presented. we
note that lorentz invariance of such quantities as propagation amplitudes and scattering amplitudes is ensured when
we employ a euclidean formulation by virtue of the variable transformation p0  ip0. this is not a rotation of
the contour in the sense of the wick rotation (since the contour does not close), and as we shall demonstrate such
a transformation recovers the minkowski space propagation amplitude. thus, preservation of the four dimensional
rotational symmetry of euclidean space will also preserve lorentz invariance.

ii. the scalar field

super-renormalizable and renormalizable quantum eld theories are characterized by the dimensionality of their
in the rst case, the perturbation
coupling constants which have positive mass dimension or are dimensionless.
expansion of the n-point functions or scattering amplitudes have positive length dimension and the degree of divergence
of the graphs becomes smaller as more vertices are included. in renormalizable theories, the perturbation expansions

1

are dimensionless and only a nite number of amplitudes supercially diverge; however, divergences occur at all
orders in perturbation theory and can be automatically removed by a redenition of a nite number of physical
constants. nonrenormalizable theories are characterized by negative dimensional coupling constants. consequently,
the perturbation expansions have dimension
length and as we include more vertices the degree of divergence becomes
larger.

a point particle renormalizable theory can be rendered nite by implementing regularization procedures; for ex-
ample, by introducing a high momentum cut o  in which case we renounce all interest in regions less than 1
and consequently, the point of interaction (the vertex) is fuzzed out. however, such procedures fail to render non-
renormalizable theories nite while preserving essential features such as gauge invariance, lorentz invariance, and
unitarity. instead of introducing such cut os we can take advantage of the fuzziness inherent in the particle to place
an eective lower bound on the short distances. it is for this reason that we introduce fuzzy particle intermediate
states in a nonrenormalizable theory.

(2.1)

where  is a negative dimensional coupling constant. the free scalar eld is usually approached by expanding the
eld as a sum over 3-momenta of independent harmonic oscillators. the starting point for such a treatment is the
klein-gordon equation and the promotion of classical elds to operators is achieved by the imposition of canonical
commutation relations. if we compute the propagation amplitude from the eld expansion we recover the greens
function of the klein-gordon operator. this is expected since the canonical commutation relations are quantum
mechanical generalizations of the poisson brackets found in classical mechanics. furthermore, since a point particle
can be localized with arbitrary precision, we are able to characterize such particles as existing in well dened 3-
momentum states at any instant in time. when we generalize the extended object formulation of quantum mechanics
we are unable to retain this characterization because the particle is smeared out in a small region of spacetime.
in order to incorporate the smearing in the time direction into our innite dimensional generalization, we have to
characterize a fuzzy particle by its 4-momentum or its mass (when on shell). moreover, the commutation relations
that arise in the extended object formulation cannot be viewed as simple quantum mechanical generalizations of the
classical poisson brackets since the compton wavelength of classical particles vanishes. it is to be noted that any
attempt to impose the noncanonical commutation relations in the usual approach will violate lorentz invariance since
the commutator between the eld and the momentum density as a function of 3-momentum:

[(p), (q)] = iep2/m2

(3)(p  q)

(2.2)

where p2 = p2 will not be a lorentz invariant quantity and which in turn leads to acausal behavior in the theory. the
reason for this behavior is because such a generalization introduces fuzziness in space but not in the time direction: for
example, consider the instantaneous annihilation of a particle of nite extent. as a consequence, we adopt a unied,
lorentz invariant, spacetime generalization of the extended object formulation to elds given by

[(p), (q)] = iep2/m2

(4)(p  q)

(2.3)

where p2 = pp is a euclidean scalar. this generalization allows us to characterize the fuzzy particle intermediate
states as well dened 4-momentum states or as a collection of masses (when on shell). we are now in a position to
write down the eld expansions for (x):

(x) =z

d4p
(2)4

and the corresponding momentum density:

(apeipx + apeipx)

1

pp2 + m2

d4p

(x) =z

(2)4 (i)pp2 + m2(apeipx  apeipx).

(2.4)

(2.5)

where the weights have been chosen so that with canonical commutations underlying, that is,(cid:2)ap, aq(cid:3) = (2)4(4)(pq)

we obtain

d4p
(2)4

1

p2 + m2 eip(xy).

(2.6)

dr(x  y) = h0|(x)(y)|0i =z

2

which is the retarded scalar eld propagator or the greens function for the klein-gordon operator. we observe that
eq. (2.6) is symmetric under x  y (just change p  p) implying that [(x), (y)] = 0 for all x and y.the vanishing
of this commutator can be explained by noting that (x) is a eld which creates and destroys 4-momentum (or mass)
states and the measurement of such a eld at one spacetime point cannot aect the measurement at another spacetime
point since 4-momentum states are relativistic invariants. however, there is a nonzero propagation amplitude for 4-
momentum states. let us denote by (3)(x) the usual 3-momentum expansion of the eld obtained by quantizing the
classical equation of motion, that is,

p2ep
where ep =pp2 + m2. then from eq. (2.6) it follows that

(3)(x) =z

d3p
(2)3

1

(apeipx + apeipx)

dr(x  y) = h0|(x)(y)|0i = (x0  y0)h0|[(3)(x), (3)(y)]|0i.

(2.7)

(2.8)

thus, the 4-momentum expansion generates the correct propagation amplitude for the scalar eld which admits
a representation as the vacuum expectation value of the commutator of 3-momentum eld expansions. since the
ordinary scalar eld is quantized by generalizing the spatial commutation relations obtained from ordinary quantum
mechanics to innite dimensions, time remains a parameter, and questions of causality arise. it is well known that
this commutator vanishes over spacelike intervals and that causality is preserved in the ordinary scalar eld. this is
expected since the propagation amplitude for the ordinary scalar eld can also be obtained from a lorentz invariant,
spacetime generalization of a causal structure, namely, ordinary quantum mechanics. when we impose noncanonical
(4)(p  q) on the eld and momentum density expansions we obtain

commutation relations (cid:2)ap, aq(cid:3) = (2)4ep2/m2

the propagation amplitude describing intermediate states as:

d(x  y) = h0|(x)(y)|0i =z

d4p
(2)4

ep2/m2
p2 + m2 eip(xy).

(2.9)

we once again observe the symmetry under x  y (by changing p  p) which reects the fact that (x) creates and
destroys relativistically invariant 4-momentum states. the correspondence between euclidean space and minkowski
space propagation amplitudes is eected by means of the variable transformation p0  ip0 which has been mentioned
before. this is not a rotation of the contour in the sense of the wick rotation since the contour of integration does
not close in this case. we note that the corresponding dp0 integration limits in minkowski space go from i to i.
in order to explain this feature, consider the commutation relations arising from the quantum mechanics of extended
objects

[xfi , pj] = iep 2/m2

ij and [xf0 , p0] = iep 2

0 /m2

.

(2.10)

where p 2 = pip i. the spacetime generalization of these commutation relations in minkowski space can be achieved
by writing them as

(cid:2)xf , p(cid:3) = i ep 2/m2

(2.11)

where p 2 = pp  is a lorentz scalar and  = (1, 1, 1, 1). however, such spacetime commutation relations do not
lend themselves to a lorentz invariant generalization to elds due to the presence of the minkowski metric. the only
other possibility is to re-express the fuzzy time and energy commutation relation as

[ixf0 , ip0] = iep 2

0 /m2

(2.12)

in order to get rid of the relative negative sign in eq. (2.10). this would imply that the dp0 integration limits would
now go from i to i and it is for this reason that the minkowski space propagation amplitude remains bounded
in spite of the positive term in the exponential. if the contour of integration were to close this would be a wick
rotation as is the case in the limit of vanishing compton wavelength. equivalently, we can formulate the theory in
euclidean space. the euclidean momentum space propagator is given by:

which is bounded from above and below since p2 is a euclidean scalar. in the limit as the compton wavelength
vanishes we recover the usual scalar eld propagator (euclidean). we note that in arriving at this propagator we have

d(p) =

ep2/m2
p2 + m2 .

(2.13)

employed a dierent quantization prescription but we have not changed the lagrangian, that is, the classical eld
theory is left undisturbed. since the quantization prescription arises from the quantum mechanics of extended objects
which has no classical counterpart, we are justied in employing this procedure. a crucial feature of this propagator is
the gaussian damping which renders the theory nite; for example, insertion of an arbitrary number of vertices in the
n-point function of a 6 theory would no longer make the graphs divergent because the gaussian damping eliminates
the high frequency modes. since the extended object formulation is a causal structure its innite dimensional, lorentz
invariant, generalization will obey causality. in order to prove that causality is not violated we need to establish that
the propagation amplitude for 4-momentum states given in eq. (2.9) does not admit a representation as the vacuum
expectation value of the commutator of two 3-momentum eld expansions. this is crucial since the propagation
amplitude does not vanish over spacelike intervals but this in itself does not violate causality. the correct statement
of causality requires us to determine whether a measurement made at one spacetime point can aect a measurement
made at another spacetime point outside the light cone. causality is preserved if the commutator of two 3-momentum
eld expansions vanishes over spacelike intervals provided (3)(x) exists. if (3)(x) does not exist the nonvanishing
of the propagation amplitude over spacelike intervals will have no implication for causality. in scalar eld theory
with canonical commutation relations underlying we are able to construct eld expansions (3)(x) for intermediate
states which are sum over 3-momenta of independent harmonic oscillators obtained by simply quantizing the klein-
gordon equation. we observe that with noncanonical commutation relations underlying we can no longer construct
(3)(x) because well dened 3-momentum characterizations for fuzzy particle states do not exist which we expect from
considerations of lorentz invariance and causality. in order to prove that it is impossible to construct well dened
3-momentum states for fuzzy particles, assume that there exists (3)(x) such that

(x0  y0)h0|[(3)(x), (3)(y)]|0i =z

d4p
(2)4

ep2/m2
p2 + m2 eip(xy).

in particular, for x = y, we require that

ep2/m2
p2 + m2 = 0.

z d4p

(2.14)

(2.15)

the euclidean momentum space integral can be easily evaluated by employing the variable transformation p2 = u but
in order to demonstrate a method which will be useful in proving unitarity, we adopt a dierent approach. due to the
essential singularity at innity the dp0 integral cannot be evaluated by contour integration. switching to dimensionless
variables we wish to evaluate

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

where ep =pp2 + m2. the 3-momentum integral over the error function is a nonzero quadrature and we arrive at a
contradiction to our original requirement that the integral in eq. (2.15) vanish. as the compton wavelength vanishes
( 1
m  0) the left hand side of eq. (2.21) reverts to the ordinary scalar eld propagator (for x = y) and the right
hand side vanishes, a result we expect. hence, the existence of 3-momentum characterizations for fuzzy particle states
would have been an indication of acausal behavior. similarly, we can demonstrate that there exists no (3)(x) which
can satisfy eq. (2.14) for x 6= y. evaluation of the propagation amplitude for x 6= y leads to a sum of error functions
of arguments involving x y and a functional form for (3)(x) as a sum of creation and annihilation operators becomes
impossible to obtain. thus, the fact that we have constructed the eld theory from a lorentz invariant, spacetime
generalization of a causal formulation, namely, the quantum mechanics of extended objects, combined with the fact
that 3-momentum characterizations do not exist for fuzzy particle intermediate states allows us to conclude that the
statement of causality is not violated in the theory.

iii. unitarity in the theory

the optical theorem relates the forward scattering amplitude to the total cross section for production of all nal
states. since the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude gives the attenuation of the forward going wave
as the beam passes through the target, it is natural that this quantity should be proportional to the probability of
scattering [2]. in the quantum eld theory of point particles each diagram contributing to an s-matrix element is
purely real unless some denominators vanish so that the i prescription for treating the poles becomes relevant, that
is, a feynman diagram yields an imaginary part for the scattering amplitude m only when the virtual particles in
the diagram go on mass shell. in the quantum eld theory of extended objects because of the gaussian damping term
in the propagator the scattering amplitude exhibits an imaginary part even below the threshold for production of
multiparticle states. however, this is the unphysical part of the scattering amplitude and does not contribute to the
optical theorem since we only need to verify whether the physical scattering amplitude which lies above the threshold
for the production of multiparticle states is equal to the total cross section for the production of all such states. let
us rst calculate the scattering amplitude at order-2 with a 6 interaction. the order-2 diagram is shown in gure
1 and the contribution of this diagram is given by the lorentz invariant integral

(3.1)

where k = p4

i=1 ki and we have chosen a symmetric routing of momenta. we observe that the because of the
dimensional coupling (mass dimension = -2) we would need to increase the powers of momentum in the integrand
in order to render the graph dimensionless, but because of the gaussian damping factors the graphs will not diverge
at any order. due to the essential singularities in the integrand arising due to the gaussian damping terms in the
propagators, this integral cannot be evaluated by contour integration and for the same reason the cutkosky cutting
rules do not apply. consequently, we employ the standard method of feynman parameters to obtain

and erf c is the complementary error function. consider the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude. the
square root of  has a branch cut when its argument becomes negative, that is, when

the product x(1  x) is at most 1

4 so m(k) has a branch cut beginning at

k2x(1  x) + m2 < 0.

k2 = 4m2

(3.6)

(3.7)

at the threshold for the creation of a multiparticle state. when  < 0(that is, k2 > 4m2) h(k) and the exponential
factors in eq. (3.4) become purely real, and since erf (ix) = i2 r x
dx the error functions with complex arguments
in eq. (3.4) become purely imaginary functions. consequently, the right hand side of eq. (3.4) becomes purely real.
due to the extra factor of i in the scattering amplitude we nd that m(k) is purely imaginary above threshold, that
is,

0 ex2

imm(k) = m(k) when  < 0

(3.8)

a fact which will be important in proving unitarity. this fact implies that the forward going wave is purely attenuating
as the beam passes through the target and the cross section which is proportional to the probability of scattering is at
its maximum. thus, the hitherto nonrenormalizable interaction saturates the unitarity bound. this bound is saturated
whenever the scattering phase shift is an odd multiple of 
2 . this condition implies the formation of resonances or
metastable bound states. in a scattering process at a resonant energy, the incident particle has a larger probability
of becoming temporarily trapped in such a metastable bound state and this possibility increases the scattering cross
section. resonances are not observed in 4 theory scattering processes, at least at this order, and their appearance
in 6 theory may reect the increased interaction eld strength.

below the threshold for production of multiparticle states, that is, when  > 0 we observe that the scattering
amplitude has an imaginary part as we expect. this is the unphysical part of the scattering amplitude since the
virtual particles cannot go on shell and it does not contribute to the scattering process. by cutting through the
diagram as shown in gure 1 we can evaluate the cross section which has the value

we note that the normalization we have chosen for fuzzy particle intermediate states is lorentz invariant. the
nontrivial contribution to the s-matrix comes from the term:

in contracting the  operators with the external 3-momentum states we make use of the usual expansion (3)(x) given
in eq. (2.7) to obtain

this is exactly twice the scattering amplitude 2m(k) for the whole process. we have already proved that above the
threshold for production of multiparticle states

imm(k) = m(k), when  < 0.

(3.19)

thus, it follows that the imaginary part of the physical scattering amplitude is equal to the total cross section for
production of all nal states after the requisite kinematical factors needed to build a cross section have been supplied.
therefore, the optical theorem is obeyed at order-2 in perturbation theory and unitarity is preserved at this order.
we now proceed to evaluate the optical theorem at order-4 in perturbation theory. consider a typical order-4

apart from angular coecients f (l) is a function only of l2 and l. therefore, the dl integration can be brought into
the same form as in eq. (3.3) by collecting the angular coecients. the results of such an integration leads to a sum
of error functions of complex arguments each of which is multiplied by an exponential factor also of complex argument
as in eq. (3.4). since the subsequent angular integration does not change the analytic structure of the scattering
amplitude we can conclude(as before) that

thus, the physical scattering amplitude saturates the unitarity bound and resonances are found to occur at order-4
in perturbation theory. by cutting through the diagram as shown in gure 2 and evaluating the cut diagrams we can
compute the cross section. a simple calculation shows that the cross section is proportional to

imm(k) = m(k), when  < 0.

which is exactly twice the scattering amplitude for the whole process. by making use of eq. (3.29) we nd that the
imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is equal to the total cross section for production of all nal states after
the requisite kinematical factors needed to build a cross section have been supplied. thus, the optical theorem holds
at order-4 in perturbation theory and unitarity is preserved at this order. since the dynamical contributions to the
scattering process begin at order-4 we can expect the optical theorem to hold at every order in perturbation theory
and by introducing d dimensional coordinates(d > 4) we can similarly verify the optical theorem at higher orders in
perturbation theory.

iv. the kallen-lehmann representation

the kallen-lehmann representation gives us a spectral representation of the propagator in the interacting picture.
we wish to determine whether the euclidean momentum space propagator given in eq. (2.13) admits such a spectral
representation in the interacting picture. this is important because it allows us to physically interpret the interacting
propagator as a weighted sum of free propagation amplitudes. to analyze the two point function h|(x)(y)|i we
will insert the identity operator as a sum over a complete set of states. we choose these states to be eigenstates of
the 4-momentum operator p. the two point function becomes

h|(x)(y)|i =x z

d4p
(2)4 ep2/m2

h|(x)|pihp|(y)|i

(4.1)

where |i is the interacting vacuum state, |pi is the eigenstate of p , and the sum runs over all 4-momentum states.
using translational invariance we can write

and

h|(x)|pi = h|(0)|pieipx

|h|(0)|pi|2 =

p2 + m2


z.

(4.2)

(4.3)

the probability density to create a single particle 4-momentum state from the free vacuum can be calculated from
the eld expansions given in eq. (2.4) and is given by

|hp|(0)|0i|2 =

e2p2/m2
p2 + m2 .

(4.4)

therefore, the probability density to create a given 4-momentum state from the interacting vacuum is given by
the product of the probability density to create a one particle state from the free vacuum times a factor z which
represents the eect of the interaction on the vacuum. we note that in ordinary scalar eld theory which is described
by point interactions the probability of creating a 4-momentum state from the free vacuum is zero because

p2 + m2 = 0.

(4.5)

this quantity is necessarily zero because a nonzero probability for creation of a 4-momentum point particle state from
the vacuum would violate causality. using the 3-momentum eld expansions we observe that

z d4p|hp|(0)|0i|2 = h0|2(0)|0i = h0|[(3)(0), (3)(0)]|0i

(4.6)

and hence the probability must vanish. this is due to the fact that point particle mass states simply cannot exist,
and for this reason 4-momentum expansions are not employed in ordinary scalar eld theory even though they lead
to the correct propagator. by inserting eq. (4.2) and eq. (4.3) in our expression for the two point function we obtain

h|(x)(y)|i =z

v. conclusion

in this paper we have demonstrated that the hitherto nonrenormalizable scalar eld with a  6

interaction can be
rendered nite provided we characterize the intermediate states as fuzzy particle states. such a characterization is
motivated by generalizing the quantum mechanics of extended objects to innite dimensions. we have also demon-
strated that this generalization does not violate causality, lorentz invariance and unitarity (veried up to fourth order
in the coupling constant). furthermore, we have nowhere exploited the scalar character of the eld in this approach.
this suggests that other nonrenormalizable quantum eld theories such as quantum electrodynamics with the pauli
term or the quantum theory of gravity can be rendered nite by implementing this procedure.
