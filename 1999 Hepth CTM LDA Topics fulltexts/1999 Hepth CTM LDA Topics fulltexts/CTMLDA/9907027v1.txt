abstract

the non-trivial ultraviolet xed point in quantum gravity is calculated by means of the
exact renormalization group equation in d-dimensions (2  d  4). it is shown that the
ultraviolet non-gaussian xed point which is expected from the perturbativelly -expanded

calculations in 2 +  gravity theory remains in d = 4. hence it is possible that quantum

gravity is an asymptotically safe theory and renormalizable in 2 < d.

introduction

the successes of the perturbative renormalization group equation have allowed for the progress

in elementary particle physics. however, there are many phenomena which have not been studied

by this perturbative method. as is well known, quantum gravity (qg) must be treated non-

perturbativelly. to make qg a perturbativelly consistent theory it is necessary to treat the

innite number of couplings. this is because, in d = 4, the l-loop perturbative calculations in

einstein gravity cause divergences that are proportional to the l + 1 powers of the curvature

tensor. thus to remove these divergences innite number of couplings are necessary. however, if

qg is an asymptotically safe theory, it becomes renormalizable.[1] an asymptotically safe theory

has ultraviolet (uv) non-gaussian xed points (ngfp) on the hypersurface which separates the
phase space. near that fp,  1, 2, couplings become irrelevant. hence the renormalization
group (rg) ows near the hypersurface are governed by these irrelevant couplings and go toward

the ngfp. on the other hand, if the rg ows move away from the ngfp on the hypersurface,

the nite number of relevant couplings govern the theories. in addition, if qg has an infrared

(ir) gaussian xed point (gfp), the rg ows move toward it. as a result, the ir eective

theories are described by the nite number of couplings and become renormalizable. hence,

whether or not qg is renormalizable depends on the existence of the uv ngfp.

there are studies that suggest the existence of a uv ngfp. one of these discussions is 2 + 

gravity theory which applies the -expanded perturbative calculation to qg in d = 2 + .[2, 3]

the result of this theory suggests that there exists a uv ngfp for the newton constant in

o(), and it is expected that it will remain in d = 4. this implies that qg is an asymptotically

safe theory and renormalizable for d > 2. however, the -expansion is an asymptotic expansion.

hence the large order behavior of  is not reliable. on the other hand, simplicial gravity suggests

that qg exhibits a rst order phase transition in d = 3, 4. this means that qg is not an

asymptotically safe theory or renormalizable in d = 3, 4. hence the results of 2 +  gravity

theory and simplicial gravity are contradictory.

if this is actual, non-trivial phenomena must occur in the range 2 < d  3. however the
-expansion and the lattice calculation are not applicable in such dimensions. thus to solve

this problem, other non-perturbative methods are needed. the exact renormalization group

equation (erge) [4] is one non-perturbative method and does not suer from the constraints

1

of the dimension, if it is formulated in arbitrary dimensions.[5] recently, m. reuter formulated

an erge for qg in arbitrary dimensions.[6] though the advantage that this formulation is

applicable in any dimension has not been used in the investigation of the destiny of the uv

ngfp in 2 +  gravity theory. hence, the purpose of this article is to clarify, by means of
reuters formulation, the possibility that qg possesses a uv ngfp in 2 < d  4.

this paper is organized as follows. in the next section the formulation of the erge for qg

is reviewed (for details see ref. [6]). there, the -functions for the newton constant and the
cosmological constant are derived. in 3 the existence of the uv ngfp and the perturbative
limits of the erge are discussed using these -functions. section 4 is devoted to summary and

discussion.

2 formulation and approximation of the erge

2.1 quantization of gravity in the background eld method

in this subsection the lagrangian lgr which is the general functional of the metric is quantized
in the background eld method. the metric  is decomposed as  = g + h . here g is

the background eld and is invariant under the brst transformations: b g = 0. fluctuations

around the background are denoted by h . the brst transformations of h , the anti-ghost
eld c, the ghost eld c  and the b-eld b are given by

bh = 2lc,
bc  = 2c c , bb = 0.

b c = b,

here  is expressed in terms of the bare newton constant g as  = (32 g)1/2. in addition,
lc represents the lie derivative with respect to c . the gauge xing function f is dened by

f = f +


2

b,

where  is the gauge parameter. here f xes the gauges to the harmonic gauge and is given

by

f = 2f 

 [g]h,

 [g] = 
f 

 g d 

1
2

g d.

here d is the covariant derivative which is a function of g . the gauge xing term lgf and
the faddeev-popov ghost term lfp are given by lgf + lfp = b(cid:0) cf (cid:1). now the generating

2

functional for the green function and that for the connected green function are given by

z[j, ,  ; g] = exp w [j, ,  ; g] =z d exp{s[; g]  ses} ,

(1)

where b-eld integral is completed. here, the shorthand notation  = {h , c , c} for the
elds and j = {t , , } for the external source elds is introduced. the bare action s[; g]
in eq. (1) is

s[; g] = z ddxlgr[g + h] +

1

2z ddxgg ff z ddxg cm

 c 

= sgr[h; g] + sgf[h; g] + sfp[h, c, c; g].

here m

 is given by

m[, g]

 = gg d ( d +  d)  g g d d.

the last term in eq. (1) is the external source term,

ses = z ddxg {j + lc + c  c } ,

where the external source elds for the brst transformations of  are included.

2.2 derivation of the exact renormalization group equation

the scale-dependent generating functional for the connected green function is dened by

exp{wk[j, ,  ; g]} =z d exp{s[; g]  ks[; g]  ses},

where k is the cuto scale. the cuto action ks[; g] is given by

ks[; g] =

2z ddxg h (rgrav
+2z ddxg c(rgh

k [g])c .

[g])h

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

here the cuto operators rgrav

k

[g] and rgh

k [g] are expressed as

rgrav

[g] = z grav
k
k [g] = z gh
rgh

k2r(0)( d2/k2),
k k2r(0)( d2/k2),

k

k = z grav
z grav

k

g g,

where z grav

k

and z gh

k are the renormalization factor of h and the ghost eld, respectively. the

cuto function r(0)(u) must satisfy two conditions:

r(0)(0) = 1, r(0)(u  ) = 0.

(6)

3

in this article r(0)(u) = u/(exp(u)  1) is used. the cuto action ks goes to zero as k  0,
because the cuto operators rgrav,gh
[g] go to zero in this limit. thus wk coincides with the

k

usual generating functional for the connected green function in this limit.

if eq. (4) is dierentiated with respect to t = ln k, we obtain

(7)

the functional derivatives of wk are regarded as the vertices. hence the rst and third terms

on the rhs of eq. (7) correspond to the dumbbell (tree) diagrams. in addition, the second and

fourth terms on there correspond to the loop diagrams. eectively, the loop diagrams contribute

to the low energy physics. the introduction of the eective averaged action k makes eq. (7)

1pi form.[7] the eective averaged action is dened by

k[, ,  ; g] =z ddxgj(x)(x)  wk[j, ,  ; g]  ks[; g],

(8)

where the shorthand notation  = {h , , } is used for the classical eld . the components
of  are given by

in addition, the classical eld g corresponding to  is introduced by

this is the erge for the eective averaged action. here (2)
k

is the hessian of k with respect

to the subscript. for the same reason as that with wk, k coincides with the usual 1pi eective

action as k  0. in addition, at the cuto scale , which is the cuto of the theory, k satises

[h, , ; ,  ; g] = sgr[h + g] + sgf[h; g] + sfp[h, , ; g]

z ddxg {lg + } .

(10)

this is the boundary condition to solve eq. (9) (for details see ref. [6]).

2.3 constraints of the functional space

to this point the breaking of the brst invariance by the introduction of the cuto action has

not been mentioned. in the usual eld theories, the ward-takahashi identity is

however, the introduction of ks modies this to

0 = hbsesi.

if this is written in terms of the eective averaged action, we obtain

0 = hbses + bksi.

k = k  sgf has been introduced. in the usual eld theories, the rhs of eq. (11)

where 
disappears. though the existence of the cuto action makes it proportional to rgrav,gh
however, yk goes to zero as k  0, because rgrav,gh
usual eld theories are recovered. on the other hand, yk does not disappear in the intermediate

[g] goes to zero in this limit. hence the

k

k

scale k. thus the brst symmetry is broken in these scales.

now to obtain the brst invariant rg ows approximately, the space of the action func-

tionals is truncated. as a rst step towards such a truncation the evolution of the ghost action

is neglected. under this approximation the ansatz of the eective averaged action is

k[g, g, , ; ,  ] = k[g] + k[g, g] + sgf[g  g; g] + sfp[g  g, , ; g]

z ddxg {lg + } .

(12)

here sgf and sfp are in the same form as in the bare action. the coupling to the brst

variations also has the same form as in the bare action. the remaining term is decomposed

5

into k[g] and k[g, g]. the latter term k contains the deviations for g 6= g . therefore
[g, g = g] = 0, by denition. this term is interpreted as the quantum corrections to sgf.

equation (12) satises the boundary condition eq. (10) at k =  if these terms satisfy

 = sgr,

 = 0.

this condition suggests that setting k = 0 for all k is a candidate for the rst approximation.

if eq. (12) is inserted into eq. (11), we have

z ddxlg

k[g, g]
g (x)

= yk(cid:16)rgrav

k

[g], rgh

k [g](cid:17) .

(13)

the rhs of eq. (13) is regarded as the higher loop corrections (for details see ref. [6]). hence
to neglect yk is acceptable in the rst approximation. this is consistent with setting k = 0

for all scales. these approximation means that the rg ows are projected on the background

spaces. on the background spaces the brst invariance is recovered. as a result, the projected

rg ows are the brst invariant.

if eq. (12) is inserted into eq. (9), we nd

k [g])(cid:21) .

[g])(cid:21)

this is the truncated erge for k[g, g]. here k[g, g] is given by

k[g, g] = k[g, g, 0, 0; 0, 0]

= k[g] + sgf[g  g; g] + [g, g].

in addition, (2)
k

is the hessian of k[g, g] with respect to g at xed g .

2.4 einstein-hilbert truncation

(14)

(15)

to actually solve eq. (14) is very dicult. hence to make the problem easier, the eective

averaged action must be approximated. the most naive approximation is to expand the ef-

fective averaged action in terms of the operators which are invariant under general coordinate

transformations. the rst step of this approximation is to take sgr as the einstein-hilbert

action:

sgr =

1

16 gz ddxg(cid:8)r(g) + 2(cid:9) ,

6

where  is the bare cosmological constant. the scale dependent couplings are dened by

g  gk = z 1

n k

g,

  k,

  k = z 1

n k .

in this article  = 1 is used. from eq. (15), the eective averaged action becomes

k[g, g] = 22zn kz ddxg(cid:8)r(g) + 2k(cid:9)

+2zn kz ddxg g (f 

 g)(f 

 g).

(16)

here k is neglected. if eq. (16) is dierentiated with respect to t and projected at g = g ,

we have

tk[g, g] = 22z ddxg(cid:2)r(g)tzn k + 2t(zn k k)(cid:3) .

this is the lhs of eq. (14). the next step is to get the rhs of eq. (14). the eective averaged
action is expanded in terms of h . for the quadratic term of h , h is decomposed as

h = h +

1
d

g .

(17)

(18)

here h is the traceless part of h : g h = 0. on the other hand,  is the trace part of h :
 = g h . in addition, the function (z grav

) in the cuto operator is decomposed as

k

(z grav

k

where

) =(cid:20)(i  p) 

d  2
2d

p 


(cid:21) zn k,

p 


= d1g g.

the rst term on the rhs of eq. (18) projects the traceless part. the second term there projects

the trace part. to proceed with the calculations, the background is xed by the maximally
symmetric space. hence the riemann tensor r and the ricchi tensor r are parameterized
in terms of the c-number scalar curvature r. in this background, r is regarded as not a function

of the metric, but a number. in the following the projection at g = g is applied. therefore,

the bars of the metric and curvature scalar are omitted. from these manipulations, if the rhs
of eq. (14) is denoted by sk(r), we have

sk(r) = trthn (a + ct r)1i + trshn (a + csr)1i

2trv hn0(a0 + cv r)1i ,

(19)

with

ct =

d(d  3) + 4
d(d  1)

,

cs =

d  4
d

,

cv =

.

in eq. (19), a and n are given by

a = d2 + k2r(0)(d2/k2)  2k,
n = (1  (k)/2) k2r(0)(d2/k2) + d2r(0)(d2/k2),

where the anomalous dimension (k) is dened by (k) = t ln zn k. in addition, a0 and n0
in eq. (19) are dened similarly to a and n , except for k = 0 and (k) = 0.

now to obtain the coecients of g and gr, the rhs of eq. (19) is expanded in terms of

the scalar curvature r:

0 i
sk(r) = trthna1i + trshna1i  2trv hn0a1

r(cid:16)ct trthna2i + cstrshna2i
2cv trv hn0a2

0 i(cid:17) + o(r2).

(20)

in addition to calculating the traces in eq. (20), the heat kernel expansion is applied. hence

comparison with the results of these manipulations and eq. (17) gives the dierential equations
for tzn k and t(zn k k). if these equations are expressed in terms of the dimensionless cou-

plings of the newton constant gk and the cosmological constant k, the -functions for these

are given by

tgk = g = [d  2 + (k)]gk,

tk =  = (2  )k +

3.1 the case k = 0

to see the behavior of the newton constant and to simplify the problem, the cosmological

constant is ignored. this approximation is applicable if the cosmological constant is much

smaller than the cuto scale k. in this case the phase structure is described by the -function

for the newton constant only:

in contrast to eq. (23), the anomalous dimension is denoted by (k) and given by

tgk = g =(cid:2)d  2 + (k)(cid:3) gk.

coupling region is considered, in d = 1.9, qg has one phase and becomes an asymptotically free

theory. the solid line in the gure is the result in d = 2. this -function has one fp. if the same

coupling region is considered, qg has one phase and becomes an asymptotically free theory in

d = 2. the dashed line in the gure is the result in d = 2.1. this -function has two fps. one

is the ir gfp and the other is the uv ngfp. in contrast to the result in d = 1.9, the ngfp

exists in a positive coupling region. thus qg has two phases in this region. one corresponds to

the weak coupling phase, and the other corresponds to the strong coupling phase. these results

for the structure of the phase space coincide with the ordinary perturbative calculation in 2 + 

gravity theory. this result suggests that this uv ngfp will remain in d = 4. however, the

usual -expansion does not predict the possibility that uv ngfp in d = 2.1 remains in higher

dimensions. on the other hand, eq. (25) is free from a constraint of the dimensionality. hence

this -function is applicable even if the dimension is greater than 2. figure 1 (b) is the result
in 2  d  4. this gure suggests that the uv ngfp in d = 2.1 remains in d = 4. hence it
is expected that qg will have a uv ngfp in 2 < d  4. this ngfp separates the positive
coupling region into two phases. one is the weak coupling phase, and the other is the strong

one.

the numerical calculations of the rg ows in d = 4 are shown in fig. 2. these were derived

by numerically solving the dierential equation eq. (25) under some initial conditions. the

these converge to the ir gfp. the dashed lines are the ows in the strong coupling phase.

these two phases are separated by the uv ngfp.

the fps g satisfy

0 = tg = [d  2 +

thus the solutions are g = 0 and 

 = 2  d. the former solution corresponds to the gfp
and the latter is a candidate for the ngfp. if eq. (26) is inserted into the latter condition, we

obtain

g =

this solution becomes zero in d = 2. therefore, gfp are degenerate in this dimension. on
the other hand this solution is the ngfp in d 6= 2. the numerical calculation of eq. (27) in

gravity theory in the harmonic gauge up to o(). these results coincide in d  2. however, the
dierence of the position for the uv ngfp becomes large as d  4. to see the correspondence
between the erge and 2 +  gravity theory, the perturbative limit of the erge is considered

this coincides with the result of 2 +  gravity theory in the harmonic gauge up to o().[2] in

addition, this result is independent of the shape of the cuto functions up to this order.

g =

(30)

where the fp of the cosmological constant is denoted by , which must satisfy t = 0. if eq.

ngfp of the newton constant can be derived from eq. (30). hence the uv ngfp is expressed

as (g, ). the numerically calculated results for the uv ngfp (g, ) are shown in fig. 4. in

this gure the lled circles and the numbers beside these represent the space-time dimensions.
from this gure it is concluded that qg has a uv ngfp in 2 < d  4, even if the cosmological
constant is taken into account. hence it is possible that qg is an asymptotically safe theory
and renormalizable in 2 < d  4.

4 summary and discussion

in this article we have discussed the existence of the uv ngfp in qg by means of the erge.
the formulation of this article suggests that a uv ngfp exists in 2 < d  4. thus it is possible
that qg is an asymptotically safe theory and renormalizable in 2 < d  4. the -expansion
of the -function for the newton constant has a uv ngfp at g = 3/38 in d = 2 + . this

coincides with the result of 2 +  gravity theory in the harmonic gauge up to o(). in addition

it is independent of the shape of the cuto functions. however, the cuto function dependence

will appear in d > 2 + . the -expanded result of the uv ngfp for the cosmological constant

14

has a cuto function dependence up to o(). thus there is the possibility that the uv ngfp

will disappear for other cuto functions. to resolve this problem it is necessary to perform

calculations for dierent sets of cuto functions.[8]

if the truncated erge is completely solved, these problems will disappear. however it

is not possible to solve it without any approximations. for this reason, the functional space is

approximated by the same space of the einstein-hilbert action. this approximation is the origin

of the appearance of the cuto function dependence. thus it is expected that this dependence

will be weakened by the extension of the action functional space. the rst step to enlarge

the functional space is to include the so-called r2-terms.[9] from another point of view, the

extension of the functional space is important. this is because the rg ows that move toward

the uv ngfp are governed by the higher derivative terms. hence to more accurately analyze

the structure of phase space in the uv regions, treatment of these terms is necessary. however,

this extension causes other problems. if the functional space is approximated by the same space

of r2-gravity theory, four -functions will be derived, therefore, four fps will appear. however,

one of these fps will correspond to the uv ngfp derived in the einstein-hilbert truncation.

in a perturbative method, such as the -expansion, it is necessary to calculate the higher loop

corrections to get reliable results. as is well known, even-loop calculations in the scalar theory

cause the uv ngfp in d = 4. however, the scalar theory is believed to be a trivial theory. thus

this uv ngfp is a ctitious fp. these problems always appear in the perturbative method.

the truncation of the functional space in this article is not a perturbative method. in scalar

theory, the extension of the functional space does not cause the disappearance of the ngfp in
3  d < 4.[5] thus it is expected that the same situation will appear in quantum gravity.

as mentioned above, the gauge parameter  is xed to unity in this formulation. however,

it is possible to analyze it in other gauges.[10] the -function is not a physical quantity.

therefore, it depends on the gauges. hence the uv ngfp which is derived from it has a gauge

dependence. however, this problem is not so serious if a uv ngfp exist for all possible gauges.

this is because the important point is not the position of the uv ngfp but its existence. in

the landau-de witt gauge  = 0, it is recognized that the uv ngfp remains in d = 4.[9]
however, to guarantee the existence of the uv ngfp in 2 < d  4, more accurate calculations
must be done.[8] in addition, there is the possibility that the physical quantities derived from

this formulation depend on the gauge. the corrections from the constant gauge parameter are

15

calculated in ref. [11], and these calculations suggest that physical quantities such as the ratio

of the newton constant and the cosmological constant are gauge independent if the truncated

erge is evaluated on-shell.

in addition to these problems, it is necessary to study the eectiveness of this formulation.

as is well known, the physical quantities of qg have been exactly calculated in d = 2. hence it

is important to calculate these quantities by means of the erge. in this article, only the pure

gravity theory is considered. however, it is interesting to analyze the eects of the matter elds

on the structure of the phase space. the erge including the matter eld has been derived in

d = 4.[11] however, analysis for the structure of the phase space does not exist.
