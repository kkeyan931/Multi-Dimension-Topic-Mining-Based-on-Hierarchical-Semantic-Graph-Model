abstract

based on the background eld method, we derive a novel reformulation of the
yang-mills theory which was proposed recently by the author to derive quark con-
nement in qcd. this reformulation identies the yang-mills theory with a deforma-
tion of a topological quantum eld theory. the relevant background is given by the
topologically non-trivial eld conguration, especially, the topological soliton which
can be identied with the magnetic monopole current in four dimensions. we argue
that the gauge xing term becomes dynamical and that the gluon mass generation
takes place by a spontaneous breakdown of brst symmetry caused by the dimen-
sional reduction. we also propose a numerical simulation to conrm the validity of
the scheme we have proposed. finally we point out that the gauge xing part may
have a geometric meaning from the viewpoint of global topology where the magnetic
monopole solution represents the critical point of a morse function in the space of
eld congurations.

1 introduction

more than twenty years ago many authors [1] have proposed various strategies of
deriving quark connement in quantum chromodynamics (qcd). one of them is to
show that the qcd vacuum is the dual superconductor which squeezes the color
electric ux between quarks and anti-quarks. the evidences have been accumulated
by recent investigations. especially, recent numerical simulations have conrmed this
picture, see [2, 3]. in this scenario, the magnetic monopole [4, 5, 6] obtained by the
abelian projection [7] in qcd plays the essential role [8, 9]. these results suggest
that the low-energy eective theory of qcd is given by the dual ginzburg-landau
theory [10]. in fact, it has been shown that the dual ginzburg-landau theory can be
derived starting from the qcd lagrangian at least in the strong coupling region, see
e.g, [11].

in the previous paper [12], we have proposed a novel formulation of the yang-
mills theory as a (perturbative) deformation of a topological quantum eld theory
(tqft). we have shown [12, 13] that the quark connement in qcd in the sense of
area law of the wilson loop (or equivalently, the linear static potential between quark
and anti-quark) can be derived from the formulation at least in the maximal abelian
(ma) gauge. the ma gauge realizes the abelian magnetic monopole in yang-mills
theory without introducing the scalar eld as an elementary eld (hence it is realized
as a composite eld constructed from the gauge degrees of freedom). in the similar
way, it has been shown [14] that the four-dimensional abelian gauge theory can have
the conning phase in the strong coupling region. this can be used to give another
derivation of quark connement in qcd based on the low-energy eective abelian
gauge theory, see [15].

the above results are consistent with those of lattice gauge theory [16], though our
formulation is given directly on the continuum space-time. this similarity is due to
a fact that the ingredients of connement in our formulation lies in the compactness
of the gauge group (or the periodicity in the gauge potential) and the existence of
topological soliton. thus, the existence of magnetic monopole is a sucient condition
for explaining quark connement, as conrmed by analytical and numerical results
[2].

in this paper, we re-derive the formulation proposed in [12, 14] based on the back-
ground eld method (bgfm) [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. a purpose of this paper is to ll the
gap in the previous presentation [12] without any ad hoc argument. this derivation
enables us to discuss various topological soliton or topological defect other than the
magnetic monopole, which might equally play the important role in explaining the
origin of quark connement. such a viewpoint is necessary to answer the question:
what are the most relevant degrees of freedom for quark connement, since the nec-
essary and sucient condition for quark connement is not yet known. therefore,
our formulation can also be applied to other scenarios of quark connement based on
various conners, e.g.
instanton, center vortex or non-abelian magnetic monopole,
although the details will be given in a subsequent paper. another advantage of bgfm
is that it simplies the proof [22, 11] that the renormalization group beta function of
the abelian-projected eective gauge theory is the same as the original yang-mills

1

non-abelian gauge theory.

in the similar way that the topological yang-mills theory [23] describes the gauge

eld congurations satisfying the self-dual equation, i.e., instantons,

the tqft that we have proposed deals with the gauge eld congurations which
obeys the ma gauge equation,

f =  f,

(1.1)

d

 [a]a

 = 0,

(1.2)

which is nothing but the background eld equation. both equations are the 1st order
partial dierential equations. they may have some properties in common. in fact, a
class of classical solutions of the ma gauge equation (1.2) simultaneously satises the
self-dual equation (1.1) and vice versa [24, 25]. it is obtained from the same ansatz
as that of t hooft for the multi-instanton. the instanton is the point defect in four
dimensions, while the magnetic monopole is the point defect in three dimensions. in
four dimensions, therefore, the magnetic monopole is a one-dimensional object, i.e., a
current k (a closed loop due to the topological conservation law k = 0). this is a
lorentz covariant generalization of the observation that the static monopole in three
dimensions draws the straight line in the time direction in four dimensions where the

monopole charge is given by the integral qm := r d3xk0(x) from the monopole density

k0. since we frequently use the magnetic monopole as implying the solution of the
ma gauge equation, the solution can describe the object which looks like the magnetic
monopole and the instanton at the same time. therefore, the magnetic monopole
and the instanton are not the disjoint concept in four dimensions. actually, strong
correlations between monopoles and instantons are shown in the analytical studies
[24, 25] and observed in the lattice simulations [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. it is easy to see
that the instanton is also a solution of the eld equation (2nd order partial dierential
equation)

d[a]f = 0.

(1.3)

however, it is not yet claried which solution of the ma gauge equation (1.2) becomes
that of the eld equation besides the solution mentioned above. the solution of (1.2)
may contain the solution which is not the solution of the eld equation (1.3).

when we see the intersection of the magnetic monopole current with the two-
dimensional plane, the classical conguration satisfying (1.2) looks like the instanton
in two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model (nlsm2), as shown in [12]. therefore the
condensation of the magnetic monopole current in four dimensions can be examined
on the two-dimensional subspace which can be chosen arbitrarily. the condensation
of the two-dimensional instanton in nlsm2 leads to that of the four-dimensional
magnetic monopole current in yang-mills theory. so the instanton condensation in
nlsm2 is a sucient condition of quark connement based on the dual superconduc-
tor scenario.

in the scenario [12] of deriving quark connement, the gauge xing part for the
gauge xing condition (1.2) has played the essential role. since the quark connement

2

must be a gauge invariant concept, it is better to derive it based on the gauge in-
variant formulation. in contrast to the lattice gauge theory, however, the continuum
formulation of the ordinary gauge theory free from the gauge xing is not available
except for special cases. then we are forced to deal with the formulation based on
the specic choice of gauge xing. the readers might think the claim strange that
the essence of quark connement lies in the gauge-xing part. recall that, in the
level of the classical theory, the action part of the gauge theory is well understood
from a viewpoint of the geometry of connection.
in quantum theory, however, we
need to include the gauge xing term in order to correctly quantize the gauge theory.
usually, the gauge xing term introduced in this way is not considered to have any
geometric meaning. however, this observation is not necessarily correct. in fact, the
gauge xing term plus the associated faddeev-popov ghost term can have the very
geometric meaning from the viewpoint of global topology, as will be discussed in this
paper. in the quantum gauge theory, therefore, the action part and the gauge xing
part should be treated on equal footing. unfortunately, we must discuss the topology
of the innite dimensional manifold for gauge eld congurations. then the math-
ematically rigorous analysis will be rather hard, so that we can at best analyze the
nite dimensional analog.

usually, we consider that, even if the gauge xing term has a geometric inter-
pretation,
it can not have any local dynamics and describe only the topological
objects, since it is written as the becchi-rouet-stora-tyupin (brst) exact form,
in the manifestly covariant
i.e., sgf = {qb, } using the brst charge qb.
formalism of gauge theory, the physical state |physi is specied by the condition,
qb|physi = 0. if we consider the theory with the action sgf = {qb, } alone by
neglecting the yang-mills action (this theory is identied with the tqft), the expec-
tation value of the gauge invariant quantity hoi does not depend on the coupling ,
since 
h0|o|0i = h0|o{qb, }|0i + h0|o|0ih0|{qb, }|0i = h0|{qb,o}i = 0
where we have used the brst invariance of o and |0i  |physi. however, taking into
account the action sy m in addition to sgf , we can not draw the same conclusion.
this is the usual situation of quantized gauge theory.

a subtle point is that the above consideration is based on the assumption that the
brst symmetry is not broken. if the brst symmetry happen to be spontaneously
broken, the physical state including the vacuum is not annihilated by the brst
charge, i.e., qb|physi 6= 0. in this case, the tqft with the action st qf t = {qb, }
can have local dynamics and the expectation value can depend on the coupling con-
stant . in our scenarios, the spontaneous breaking of the brst symmetry takes
place by the dimensional reduction (in the sense of parisi-sourlas [31, 32]), at least
for a special choice of the ma gauge [12]. this is because the equivalence of the
correlation functions hold only for a class of them and hence the hilbert space of the
reduced theory is dierent from the original theory [12]. the breaking occurs sponta-
neously in the following sense. we can choose arbitrary (d2)-dimensional subspace
from d-dimensional spacetime. once the specic subspace is chosen, however, the
original symmetry is broken by this procedure.

another purpose of this paper is to propose a numerical simulation in order to
conrm the dimensional reduction and examine its implications to quark connement

3

problem. the result will prove or disprove the validity of our scenario for deriving
quark connement based on the above reformulation.

this paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we briey review the bgfm
for the yang-mills theory and its brst version based on the functional integral
formalism. in section 3, we explain how the quantum theory of topological soliton
can be obtained in the framework of bgfm. we discuss a relationship between the
instanton and the magnetic monopole in this construction. in section 4, by making
the change of gauge eld variable, we show that the formulation proposed in [12] is
recovered from the bfgm. this is the main result of this paper. in section 5, we
give a strategy of deriving quark connement based on the above formulation. we
take up some issues which have not been mentioned in the previous publications.
we give a proposal of numerical calculation for checking the validity of the strategy.
in section 6, we examine the mass generation for the gluon eld in the ma gauge.
we discuss a possibility of mass generation caused by the dimensional reduction as a
result of breakdown of the brst symmetry. in section 7, we discuss that the gauge
xing part in the quantum theory of gauge elds can have a geometric meaning from
the viewpoint of global topology. in the nal section, we summarize the results and
discuss the role of various topological solitons other than the magnetic monopole for
explaining color connement in qcd.

2 background eld method

2.1 path integral for yang-mills eld

we consider the functional integral approach to the yang-mills gauge eld theory

(2.4)

in the quantum theory of the yang-mills gauge eld, the generating functional is

dened by 1

z[j] := z [da]( f a[a]) det"  f a

 b# exp {i[sy m [a] + (j  a)]} ,

where (j  a) is the source term

(j  a) := z ddxj a

 (x)aa

 (x).

1the tilde is used only for later convenience (in section 4) and does not have particular physical

meaning.

4

in (2.3), the gauge-xing condition is imposed by

f a[a] = 0,

(2.5)

and deth  f a

 bi is the so-called faddeev-popov (fp) determinant which is the deter-
minant of the derivative of the gauge-xing function f a under an innitesimal gauge
transformation,

aa

 = dab

 [a]b :=  a + gf abcab

 c,
:= ab  gf abcac
 .

dab



(2.6)

(2.7)

the delta function is made less singular by introducing the gauge-xing parameter 
as

( f a[a]) := yx,a

( f a[a(x)])  exp(cid:26)i

1
2 

( f [a]  f [a])(cid:27) .

for example, a common choice is the lorentz gauge,

then the fp determinant is given by

f a[a] = aa
 .

det" f a

 b# = det(dab

 [a]d(x  y)).

the connected greens functions are generated by

w [j] := i ln z[j].

the eective action is dened by making the legendre transformation

where

[ q] := w [j]  (j  q),

qa :=

w
j a


.

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

it is well known that the derivative of the eective action with respect to q are the
one-particle irreducible (1pi) greens function.

2.2 bgfm

next, we consider the quantization on a given background gauge eld ,

a =  + q,

5

(2.14)

 b# exp(cid:26)i(cid:20)sy m [ + q] + (j  q) 

where q denotes the eld to be quantized. the generating functional is given by
z[j, ] := z [dq] det" f a
( f [q]  f [q])(cid:21)(cid:27) .(2.15)
where the gauge invariance for q is broken by the the gauge xing condition f a[q] =
0 which is supposed to x completely the gauge degrees of freedom and the  f a
 b is
the derivative of the gauge-xing term under the innitesimal gauge transformation
given by

1
2 

qa

 = (d[ + q])a.

(2.16)

in (2.15), we do not couple the background eld to the source following t hooft [18]
in the background eld method (bgfm) [17, 18, 19, 20, 21], the the following

gauge xing condition is chosen,

f a[q] := dab

 []qb

 = 0,

(2.17)

which is called the background eld (bgf) gauge. an advantage of the bgf gauge
is that the bgf gauge condition retains explicit gauge invariance for the background
gauge eld  even after the gauge xing for the eld q.
proposition[19]: under the bgf gauge condition (2.17), the bgf generating func-
tional z[j, ] and w [j, ] := i ln z[j, ] are invariant under the (innitesimal)
transformation,

a
j a

 = (d[])a := ( + ig[, ])a,
 = ig[, j]a := gf abcbj c
 .

(2.18)

(2.19)

this is shown as follows. by making the change of integration variables, q 

q + i[,q], i.e.,

qa

 = ig[,q]a =   q.

(2.20)

eq. (2.19) and (2.20) represent an adjoint group rotation for j and q respectively,
so the term (j  q) is clearly invariant. adding (2.18) and (2.20), we nd

( + q)a = (d[ + q])a.

(2.21)

this is just a gauge transformation on the eld variable a =  + q, so the action
sy m [ + q] is also invariant. note that the bgf gauge condition f a[q] is just
the covariant derivative of q with respect to the bgf . eq. (2.18) is a gauge
transformation on  and (2.20) is an adjoint rotation of q. then the gauge xing
term ( f  f ) is invariant under such transformations. the fp determinant is also
invariant, since the determinant is invariant under the adjoint rotation. thus the
bgf generating functional z[j,q] is invariant under (2.18) and (2.19).

by using

w [j, ] := i ln z[j, ],

6

(2.22)

we dene the background eective action

[ q, ] := w [j, ]  (j, q),

where

qa

 =

 w
j a


.

from the invariance of z[j,q], it follows that [ q, ] is invariant under

 = (d[]),
 q = ig[, q],

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)
(2.26)

since (2.26) is a homogeneous transformation, [0, ] is invariant under the transfor-
mation (2.25) alone. hence the eective action [0, ] in the bgfm is an explicitly
gauge invariant functional of , since (2.25) is just an ordinary gauge transformation.
as a result, 1pi greens functions generated by dierentiating [0, ] with respect to
 will obey the naive ward-takahashi identities of gauge invariance. hence, [0, ]
calculated in the bgfg is equal to the conventional eective action [ q] with q = 
calculated in an unconventional gauge which depends on 

f a[q] := dab

 [](qb

  b

 ) = qa

 + gf abcb

 qc

   = 0.

then we obtain

as a special case of

[0, ] = [ q]| q=,

[ q, ] = [ q]| q= q+.

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)

the 1pi green functions calculated from the gauge invariant eective action [0, ]
will be very dierent from those calculated by conventional method in normal gauges.
nevertheless, the relation assures us that all gauge-invariant physical quantities will
come out the same in either approach [21]. thus [0, ] can be used to generate the
s-matrix of a gauge theory in exactly the same way as the usual eective action is
employed.

2.3 brst version of the bgfm

now we give the becchi-rouet-stora-tyupin (brst) version of the bgfm. the bgf
generating functional is rewritten into

z[j, ] := z [dq][d c][d c][d b] expnisy m [ + q] + isgf [q, c, c, b] + i(j  q)o ,(2.30)

7

where b is the auxiliary scalar eld and c, c are hermitian anticommuting scalar
eld called the fp ghost and anti-ghost eld, c  = c, c
= c. using the brst
transformation,



b(x) = 0,
bq(x) = d[ + q] c(x) :=  c(x)  ig[(x) + q(x), c(x)],
b c(x) = i

g[ c(x), c(x)],

1
2

c(x) = i b(x),

b
b b(x) = 0,

(2.31)

the gauge xing and the fp ghost terms for the bgg are combined into a compact
form,

sgf [q, c, c, b]

:= z ddx ib trg(cid:20) c(cid:18) f [q] +


2

b(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(2.32)

or

sgf [q, c, c, b] = z ddx trg(cid:20) bd[]q +

b b + i cd[]d[ + q] c(cid:21) , (2.33)

where  is the gauge-xing parameter and  = 0 corresponds to the landau gauge
(delta function gauge). this is clearly brst invariant bsgf = 0 due to nilpotency
b  0. if the auxiliary eld b is integrated out, the
of the brst transformation, 2
gauge-xing part reads


2

sgf [q, c, c] = z ddx trg(cid:20)

1
2 

(d[]q)2 + i cd[]d[ + q] c(cid:21) .

(2.34)

in fact, this recovers the original form (2.15), since

det" f a

 b# = z [d c][d c] exp(cid:20)iz ddx trg(cid:16)i cd[]d[ + q] c(cid:17)(cid:21) ,

the explicit form of the fp ghost term is

(2.35)

feynmann rule for the bgfm is derived from the shifted action sy m [ + q] and
(2.34), see abbott [19]. in the limit   0, the brst version of bgfm reduces to
the usual brst formulation of the yang-mills theory in the lorentz gauge, f a[q] =
q.
the advantage of the bgfm becomes apparent when the two-loop  function is
calculated. the bgfm makes the calculation much easier than previous calculations
using the conventional approach, see [20, 21].

3 quantum theory of topological soliton and bgfm

3.1 summation over topological soliton background

in the conventional approach, the background eld  is chosen to be a solution of
the classical eld equation. in yang-mills theory, the equation of motion is given by

sy m [a]

aa

  d[a]f[a] = 0.

then, under the identication (2.14),

a =  + q,

(3.1)

(3.2)

the quantization is performed around arbitrary but xed background  which sat-
ises (3.1). in this paper, we consider the topologically nontrivial eld conguration
as a background eld , around which the quantization of the yang-mills theory is
performed. once a specic type of eld congurations is chosen as the background
, we will include all possible congurations of the same type, in other words, we
sum up all contributions coming from such a type of congurations. 2 therefore,
in our formulation, a candidate for the generating functional of the total yang-mills
theory is given by

(3.3)

(3.4)

z[j] = z [d] z[j, ] =: z [d] exp(i sef f [j, ]),

where we have dened

sef f [j, ] := i ln z[j, ],
and [d] is the integration measure specied later.

note that the action sef f [j, ] can have the local gauge invariance (2.18) for 
by virtue of the bgfm. hence, the total yang-mills theory dened in this way is
identied with the (quantized) gauge theory with the action sef f [j, ], provided that
the integration measure [d] is gauge invariant. however, in order to quantize the
total yang-mills theory correctly, we need to x the local gauge invariance for the
non-abelian gauge eld . thus, instead of (3.3), we dene the generating functional
of the total yang-mills theory by

z[j] = z [d](f a[]) det"f a

b# z[j, ],

or

z[j] = z [d] det"f a

b# exp(cid:18)i sef f [j, ]  i

1
2

(f []  f [])(cid:19) ,

(3.5)

(3.6)

2 such a procedure was performed so far in various forms, e.g., by summing up the monopole-

currents trajectories [33, 34, 35].

where the gauge xing function f a is not necessarily equal to the bgf gauge f a.
the choice of f a is quite important in our formulation for realizing topological soliton
background, as explained below. in order to be able to incorporate the topological
soliton, the gauge xing function f [] should be nonlinear in . the measure [d]
must be chosen appropriately for the topological soliton in question.
in the nal
stage the measure is replaced by the integration over the collective coordinates of the
soliton.

3.2 yang-mills instanton

in four-dimensional euclidean space, the most popular topologically nontrivial eld
conguration of pure yang-mills theory is the instanton (anti-instanton) [36, 37, 38,
39, 40, 41, 42] which is a solution of the self-dual (self-antidual) equation with a nite
action,

f[a] = f 

[a], f 

[a] :=

1
2

f[a].

(3.7)

the self-dual equation (3.7) is a rst order nonlinear partial dierential equation (nl
pde), whereas the eld equation (3.1)is a second order nonlinear partial dierential
equation. the instanton is a kind of topological soliton which is possible due to the
nonlinearity of the self-dual equation. due to the bianchi identity,

any instanton (anti-instanton) solution is also a solution of the yang-mills eld equa-
tion,

but the converse does not hold. in fact, the instanton and the anti-instanton do not
exhaust the solution of the yang-mills eld equation, since there exists at least one
solution of the yang-mills eld equation (sibner-sibner-uhlenbeck (ssu) solution
[43]) which is not a solution of the self-dual equation, see fig. 1. the existence of the
instanton solution is suggested from the non-triviality of homotopy group [44, 45, 46]
3(g),

3(su(n)) = z (n = 2, 3,  ).

(3.10)

it is possible to construct the instanton background by choosing the gauge xing
condition,

f a[] = f 



a[], f 



a[] := f a

[]  f a



[].

(3.11)

it is shown [47] that this choice leads to the topological yang-mills theory [23, 48]
which is an example of the tqft of witten type. since the topological yang-mills
theory is derived from the n=2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory by the procedure
called the twisting, this might shed more light on the quark connement based on the
dual meissner eect or the magnetic monopole [49]. however, quark connement will
be realized only when the n = 2 supersymmetry is broken down to n = 1 by adding
the mass perturbation. since we do not have any convincing argument to justify such
a scenario, we do not consider this possibility anymore in this paper.

in the ma gauge in four dimensions. the instanton solution of the self-dual equation
(3.7) is also a solution of the yang-mills equation of motion (3.1). the converse is
not necessarily true. in fact, the sibner-sibner-uhlenbeck (ssu) solution [43] on s4
is a solution of the yang-mills eld equation which is not a solution of the self-dual
equation [43]. the general instanton solution on s4 can be constructed according
to the atiyah, drinfeld, hitchin and mannin (adhm) [40]. the explicit form for
the multi-instanton is known in the specic cases, e.g., t hooft type [42] or witten
type [38]. both types include one-instanton solution of belavin, polyakov, schwartz
and tyupkin (bpst) [36]. the multi-instanton solution of t hooft type is also the
solution of the magnetic monopole equation (a.1). some solutions are known for
(a.1), chernodub and gubarev (cg) [25] and brower, orginos and tan (bot) [24].
see appendix a. the general solution of (a.1) is not yet known. in principle, there
may exist a solution of the monopole equation which is not a solution of yang-mills
eld equation, indicated by ? in the gure.

3.3 magnetic monopole current

in our formulation, however, the background eld  is not a priori required to be the
classical solution of the eld equation (3.1), when we consider the quantum theory of
the background eld . in quantum theory, it is not necessarily true that the most
dominant contribution is given by the solution of the eld equation. this is obvious
in the functional integral approach because we must take into account the entropy
associated with the relevant eld congurations, which comes from the integration
measure [d] of the functional integral. in fact, whether the phase transition occurs
or not is determined according to the balance between the action (energy) and the
entropy, which is called the action (energy)-entropy argument. what kind of eld
conguration is important may vary from problem to problem.

in our approach, we take the magnetic monopole current as the topologically
nontrivial background . this choice is suggested from the recent result [9] of
monte carlo simulations in lattice gauge theories; the (abelian) magnetic monopole
after abelian projection [7] plays the dominant role in quark connement. this fact
is called the (abelian) magnetic monopole dominance [8].

the magnetic monopole in pure yang-mills theory (without the higgs scalar eld)
is obtained as follows. first, we restrict the non-abelian gauge group g to the
subgroup h (g  h) and retain only the gauge invariance for h, in other words,
the gauge group element u(x)  g is restricted to the coset g/h. to obtain abelian
magnetic monopole, h is chosen to be the maximal torus subgroup of g (we will
discuss other choices in the nal section). we realize this restriction by the partial
gauge xing. the mag is a partial gauge xing so that g/h is xed and h is
retained by choosing f a[] appropriately. the ma gauge condition is obtained by
minimizing the r[au ] with respect to the gauge rotation u where
(x)aa

(3.12)

(x),

aa

r[a] := z ddx trg/h (cid:18)1

2a(x)a(x)(cid:19) = z ddx

2

where we have used the cartan decomposition which decomposes the non-abelian
gauge eld into the diagonal and the o-diagonal pieces,

a = aa

 t a = a

t  + aa

t a.

(3.13)

note that the trace is taken only on the coset part, see appendix b. a geometric
meaning of this function is given in section 7. according to the cartan decomposition,
the abelian gauge potential is dened by

a
(x) := tr[ha(x)]

(3.14)
where h = t (i = 1,   , rankg) is the cartan subalgebra. for g = su(2), the
dierential ma gauge is obtained as
f a[a] := (ab  ab3a

(a, b = 1, 2),

ab[a3]ab


 := d

(3.15)

3)ab

where a = a3

. note that the equation

d

ab[a3]ab

 = 0

(a, b = 1, 2).

(3.16)

12

is a 1st order nonlinear partial dierential equation. we call this equation the
monopole equation in what follows.

next, using the solution of f a[a] = 0, the magnetic monopole current is dened

by

 :=  f 
k

 =

1
2

f 
,

where the abelian eld strength is given by

f 
 := a

  a
.

(3.17)

(3.18)

 (x) = q

m3(x)0 with q

m := r d3xk

m being the magnetic charge.

due to the topological conservation law, k
 = 0 the magnetic monopole current
denotes a closed loop in four dimensions. the respective magnetic monopole is char-
acterized by an integer-valued topological (magnetic) charge q
0 (x)  z
( = 1,   , n  1 = ranksu(n)). for the static monopole, the monopole current is
given by k
finally, we must check the niteness of r[a], which is necessary to dene the
morse function, see section 7. the instanton solution give a nite yang-mills action,
i.e., sy m [a] <  irrespective of the gauge choice, as a consequence of self-duality
of the equation. on the other hand, the magnetic monopole solution of f a[a] = 0
must give a nite r[a], i.e., r[a] < . this condition leads to the niteness of the
gauge-xing action, sgf [] <  in the ma gauge. in the gauge-xed formulation of
the quantum gauge eld theory, the gauge xing part sgf is important as well as the
yang-mills action, sy m . in what folllows, it is very convenient to separate the pure
gauge piece in the gauge potential,

(x) :=

i
g

u (x) u (x) = a

 (x)t a,

u  g/h.

(3.19)

for g = su(2) and h = u(1), it is shown that the abelian gauge potential

calculated as

ai(x) = tr[

1
2

3i(x)](i = 1, 2, 3)

(3.20)

agrees exactly with the well-known static potential for the dirac magnetic monopole
[4, 5, 6], see e.g. [11].

from the mathematical point of view, the existence of magnetic monopole is

consistent with the following relation for the homotopy group,

2(g/h) = 1(h) when 2(g) = 0.

(3.21)

usually, the pure yang-mills theory does not have magnetic monopole as a stable
topological soliton. this is consistent with

2(g) = 0.

(3.22)

therefore, for the existence of the magnetic monopole in pure yang-mills theory,
the coset structure g/h is an indispensable ingredient. for g = su(n), magnetic

13

monopoles of n  1 species are expected for the maximal torus group h = u(1)n 1,
since

2(su(n)/u(1)n 1) = 1(u(1)n 1) = zn 1,

whereas

2(su(n)) = 0 (n = 2, 3,  ).

4 deformation of a topological eld theory

4.1 change of eld variables

for the decomposition of eld variable,

it is possible to identify the gauge transformation

a(x) = (x) + q(x),

a(x) = d[a](x) := (x)  ig[a(x), (x)],

with a set of transformations

(x) = d[](x),
q(x) = ig[(x),q(x)].

(3.23)

(3.24)

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)
(4.4)

they corresponds to (2.18) and (2.20). note that  transforms as an gauge eld,
while q as a adjoint matter eld.
v, we take the following identication,

when a is given by a nite gauge rotation (large gauge transformation) u(x) of

(x) :=

i
g

u(x)u (x), q(x) := u(x)v(x)u (x),

(4.5)

where we have identied (x) with the background eld which is supposed to be
generated from u(x). this identication leads after simple calculation to

d[]q

:= q  ig[,q]
= (u(x)v(x)u (x)) + [u(x)u (x), u(x)v(x)u (x)]
= u(x)v(x)u (x).

therefore, the bgf gauge for q,

is equivalent to the lorentz gauge for v,

d[]q(x) = 0,

v(x) = 0,

14

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

under the identication of the variables (4.5). under (4.5), we can rewrite (4.3) as

uu  + uu  = iguu   igu(u ),

and (4.4) as

uvu  + uvu  + uvu  = iguvu   iguvu .

(4.10)

(4.11)

therefore, in the bgf gauge, (4.3) and (4.4) reduce to a set of transformations,

u(x) = ig(x)u(x),
v(x) = 0,

u (x) = igu (x)(x),

(4.12)
(4.13)

since the gauge degrees of freedom for v (small gauge transformation) is xed by
in what follows, we assume that the non-compact gauge
the lorentz gauge (4.9).
eld variable v(x) does not have topologically nontrivial conguration and all topo-
logically nontrivial contributions come from the compact gauge group variable u(x)
alone. we treat v(x) and u(x) as if they are independent variables. the topological
soliton (magnetic monopole) is derived as a solution of the nonlinear equation for 
which follows from the nonlinear gauge xing condition (ma gauge). the local gauge
invariance of z[j, ] written in terms of  and q reduces to the invariance under
the transformation (4.12), i.e.

u(x)  eig(x)u(x).

(4.14)

the measure [d] invariant under (2.18) is replaced by the invariant haar measure
[du] which is invariant under the local gauge rotation (4.14).

4.2 brst formalism

first, we rewrite the brst formulation of bgfm in terms of new variables. by
making the change of variable (4.5) which is a gauge transformation of v(x) by u(x),
it turns out that the brst transformation (2.31) for the variables ,q, c, c, b is

rewritten into

bu(x) = 0,
bv(x) = d[v](x),
b(x) = i
b (x) = i(x),
b(x) = 0,

1
2

g[(x), (x)],

where v, , ,  are the adjoint rotation of q, c, c, b respectively,
 := u  bu.

 := u  cu,

 := u  cu,

v := u qu,

15

(4.15)

(4.16)

under the adjoint rotation (4.16), the measure is invariant,

[dv][d][d][d] = [dq][d c][d c][d b].

the yang-mills action is invariant 3 under this change of variables,

sy m [a] = sy m [ + q] = sy m [v].

the gauge xing part (2.32) for the bgf gauge is transformed into

sgf [v, , , ]

:= z ddx ib trg(cid:20)(cid:18)v +
= z ddx trg(cid:20)v +


2

 + id[v](cid:21) ,


2

(cid:19)(cid:21)

(4.17)

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

where we have used (4.7) and (4.16). it turns out that the gauge xing condition for v
eld is given by the lorentz gauge (4.9). note that (4.22) agrees with the form given
in [12]. this brst transformation corresponds to the small gauge transformation
which does not change the topology of the gauge eld. thus the generating functional
(2.30) is transformed as

z[j, ] = z [dv][d][d][d] expni[sy m [v] + sgf [v, , , ] + (j  uvu )]o(4.23)

next, we consider the total generating functional

z[j]

= z [d][dc][d c][db] z[j, ] exp(i sgf [, c, c, b]) exp[i(j  )]
= z [d][dc][d c][db] exp{i sef f [j, ] + i sgf [, c, c, b] + i(j  )}.(4.25)

(4.24)

3 for the denition of the eld strength

f[a] := a  a  ig[a,a],

the change of variable a = uvu  + i

g u u  leads to

f[a] = uf [v]u  +

i
g

u [, ]u .

(4.18)

(4.19)

 := i

g u [, ]u  can have a nonzero value and may modify the
note that the second term f s
action. if u (x)  g is restricted to the coset g/h, it may yield a line-like singularity. for example,
xy := 2
it is possible to have f s
g (x)(y)(z)3 which corresponds to the presence of dirac string
extending into the direction of the negative z axis from the origin, see e.g. appendix c of [11]. here
the factor 2
g corresponds to the magnetic charge. the same contribution as the dirac string can be
incorporated by taking into account the magnetic monopole instead of the dirac string, as shown
in [11]. moreover, the existence of such terms introduces rather singular terms in the action. thus,
we do not consider the eect of this term in what follows.

16

where we have introduced the source term (j  ) for the background eld. we
introduce the brst transformation,

b(x) = d[]c(x) := c(x)  ig[(x), c(x)],
bc(x) = i
b c(x) = ib(x),
bb(x) = 0,

g[c(x), c(x)],

1
2

and the anti-brst transformation,

b(x) = d[] c(x) :=  c(x)  ig[(x), c(x)],
b c(x) = i
bc(x) = i b(x),
b b(x) = 0,

g[ c(x), c(x)],

1
2

where b is dened by

b(x) + b(x) = g[c(x), c(x)].

the brst and anti-brst transformations have the following properties,

(b)2 = 0,

(b)2 = 0,

{b, b} := b

b + bb = 0.

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

in what follows, we consider the variable u(x) as the fundamental variable instead
of (x). then the brst and anti-brst transformations for u and v are given by
(4.30)

bu(x) = ig c(x)u(x),

bu(x) = igc(x)u(x),

and

bv(x) = 0 = bv(x),

(4.31)

which are the brst version of (4.12) and (4.13) respectively. in fact, (4.30) repro-
duces the usual brst (4.26) and anti-brst (4.27) transformations of the gauge
eld,

(x) :=

i
g

u(x)u (x).

note that (4.30) and (4.31) lead to

b(x) = d[]c(x),
bq(x) = ig[c(x),q(x)].

(4.32)

(4.33)
(4.34)

these are the brst version of (4.3) and (4.4) respectively, since within the bgfm,
, c, c, b or u, c, c, b are external elds in the sense that they are not integrated

17

out in the measure [dv][d c][d c][d b]. thus the generating functional of the total

yang-mills theory reads

z[j] = z [du][dc][d c][db] exp{i sef f [j, ] + i sgf [, c, c, b] + i(j  )}, (4.35)

where [du] is the invariant haar measure and

sef f [j, ] := i ln z[j, ].

(4.36)

in order to realize the magnetic monopole background, we adopt the ma gauge

for which the gauge xing and the fp ghost terms are written in the form [11]

sgf [, c, c, b]

:= z ddx ib trg/h (cid:20) c(cid:18)f [] +


2

b(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(4.37)

where the trace is taken on the coset g/h, not the entire g. for g = su(2),

f a[] := (ab  ab33)b

 := dab[3]b


(a, b = 1, 2).

(4.38)

by choosing  = 2 and adding an brst exact ghost term, (4.37) is cast into

the more convenient form [12],

s

gf [, c, c, b] := z ddx ib btrg/h (cid:20) 1

2

(x)(x) + ic(x) c(x)(cid:21) .

(4.39)

from (4.29), s

gf is invariant under the brst and anti-brst transformations,

bs

gf = 0 = bs

gf .

(4.40)

this action s
gf describes the topological soliton derived from the nonlinear equation
f [] = 0, the monopole equation. this action is brst exact and hence there is no
local degrees of freedom propagating in spacetime. it describes the quantity related
to the global topology, as though the chern-simons theory describes the linking of
knots [50]. we call the theory with the brst exact action s
gf = st qf t alone the
topological quantum eld theory (tqft). the generating functional is given by

zt qf t [j] = z [du][dc][d c][db] exp{ist qf t [, c, c, b] + i(j  )}.

(4.41)

in view of this, the above reformulation of the yang-mills theory was called the
deformation of the tqft. 4

in the above rederivation, the fact that the eld  behaves as if it is a gauge eld

a is essential. this is guaranteed by the bgfm.

4 dierent reformulations based on the similar idea have been presented by many authors, e.g.,

by hata and taniguchi [51], and fucito, martellini and zeni [52].

18

4.3 expectation value
in our formulation, an arbitrary function f (a) of a is written as f (a) = g(v, u)h(u)
by making the change of variable (4.1) and (4.5). then the expectation value is
evaluated as

hf (a)iy m = hhg(v, u)h(u)iv

py miu
t qf t = hhg(v, u)iv
here, taking the expectation value hiu
t qf t corresponds to summing over topological
soliton contributions by making use of the tqft described by the variable u, whereas
hiv
py m denotes the expectation value for the deformation piece which is described by
the usual yang-mills theory with the variable v (here p denotes the perturbative).
of course, we can change the ordering of taking the expectation value,

py m h(u)iu

t qf t .

(4.42)

hf (a)iy m = hhg(v, u)h(u)iu

t qf tiv

py m .

(4.43)

both expressions should give the same result, if they are calculated exactly.

under the assumption of perturbative deformation, the expectation hg(v, u)ipy m
is calculated by expanding the integrand g(v, u) into power series in v. this is a
minimal assumption in the practical calculation. after that, hg(v, u)ipy m is still a
function of u, say, p(u). finally, the expectation hp(u)h(u)it qf t must be evalu-
ated in the non-perturbative way, since this piece estimates the soliton contribution.
perturbative deformation is an assumption that the deformation part is evaluated in
the perturbation theory in the coupling constant g. in other words, all the essential
non-perturbative contributions are provided with the topological soliton described by
the tqft. actually, this strategy was performed in the evaluation of the wilson loop
[12, 13].

4.4 abelian-projected eective gauge theory

the above result should be compared with the previous formulation [22, 11] which
begins with the generating functional,

z[j] = z [da][dc][d c][db] exp{isy m [a] + isgf [a, c, c, b] + i(j  a)}. (4.44)

first, following the cartan decomposition (3.13), the non-abelian gauge eld was
decomposed into the diagonal and the o-diagonal pieces,

a = aa

 t a = ai

t i + aa

t a.

(4.45)

then the ma gauge was imposed as a gauge xing condition. finally, all the o-
diagonal elds taking values in the lie algebra of the coset g/h were integrated out
in the functional integral,

z[j] = z [dai

][dc i][d c i][dbi] exp{isdiag[ai, c i, c i, bi] + i(j  a)},

(4.46)

19

where

z[ai, c i, c i, bi] := exp{isdiag[ai, c i, c i, bi]}
:= z [daa

(4.47)
][dc a][d c a][dba] exp{isy m [a] + isgf [a, c, c, b] + i(j  a)}(4.48)
the theory with the action sdiag[ai, c i, c i, bi] was called the abelian-projected eec-
tive gauge theory (apegt). it has been shown [22, 11] that the apegt has the same
beta function as the original yang-mills theory, exhibiting the asymptotic freedom,
although the apegt is an abelian gauge theory.

it turns out that the previous strategy presented in [22, 11] is equivalent to the
above formulation presented in this paper and that the results obtained in the previous
works are the immediate consequence of the present formulation, if we identify the
diagonal and o-diagonal elds with the background eld and the quantum uctuation
respectively, i.e.,

 = ai

t a.

t i, q = aa

(4.49)
the theory with an action sdiag[ai, c i, c i, bi] is written in terms of only the diagonal
elds. as long as the bgf gauge is imposed on the o-diagonal eld a, this theory
becomes the abelian gauge theory, since the bgfm guarantees that the background
eld a transforms as a gauge eld (of course, the diagonal eld is reduced to the
abelian gauge eld in this case). indeed, the bgf gauge dab[a]ab = 0 is nothing but
the ma gauge. hence the coincidence of the beta function is understood from the
bgfm.

5 strategy of a derivation of quark connement

we consider the d-dim. qcd (qcdd) with a gauge group g for d > 2. the (full)
non-abelian wilson loop is dened as the path-ordered exponent along a loop c,

w c[a] := tr(cid:20)p exp(cid:18)iic aa

 (x)t adx(cid:19)(cid:21) .

we dene the (full) string tension  by

 :=  lim

a(c)

1

a(c)

lnhw c[a]i,

(5.1)

(5.2)

where a(c) is the minimal area spanned by the wilson loop c. the non-zero string
tension  6= 0 implies that the wilson loop expectation value behaves for large loop
as

hw c[a]i  exp(a(c)).

(5.3)

this is called the area (decay) law. the static potential v (r) for a pair of quark
and anti-quark is evaluated from the rectangular wilson loop c with sides t and r
(a(c) = t r) according to

v (r) =  lim

t 

lnhw c[a]i.

1
t

20

(5.4)

the area law of the wilson loop or non-zero string tension  6= 0 implies the existence
of the linear part r in the static potential v (r), leading to quark connement.
in a series of papers [11, 12, 14, 13, 15], a derivation of the area law of the wilson

loop in qcd4 has been given in the following steps.

step 1: reformulating the yang-mills theory as a deformation of a tqft in
ma gauge [12]

step 2: parisi-sourlas dimensional reduction [12]

step 3: abelian magnetic monopole dominance [13]

step 4: instanton calculus [12]

the rst two steps are shown schematically as follows.

5.1 step 1: reformulating the yang-mills theory as a defor-

mation of a tqft in ma gauge

qcdd is reformulated as a deformation of a tqftd in ma gauge. the ma gauge
is a partial gauge xing such that the coset part g/h of the gauge group g is xed
and the maximal torus group h is left as a residual gauge group.

for g = su(2), it has been shown [13] that the expectation value of the non-

abelian wilson loop is rewritten using the non-abelian stokes theorem [13] into

hw c[a]iy m
= ** exp(cid:20)ij ic

dxna(x)v a

 (x)(cid:21)+py m

exp(cid:20)ij zs

d2z n  (n  n)(cid:21)+t qf t

(5.5)
,

where s is a surface with a boundary c (s = c) and n(x) = (n1(x), n2(x), n3(x))
is the three-dimensional unit vector (n(x)  n(x) = 1) dened by

na(x)t a = u (x)t 3u(x),

t a =

a (a = 1, 2, 3).

(5.6)

here j species the representation of the fermion in the denition of the wilson loop
and j = 1/2 corresponds to the fundamental representation.

21

5.2 step 2: parisi-sourlas dimensional reduction

it has been shown [12] that tqftd is equivalent to the coset g/h nonlinear sigma
model (nlsm) in (d-2) dimensions, nlsmd2. this is a consequence of parisi-
sourlas dimensional reduction [31] due to the supersymmetry hidden in tqft (4.41).
this is an advantage that we have chosen the ma gauge.

as extensively discussed more than 20 years ago, qcd4 and nlsm2 have various
common properties: renormalizability, asymptotic freedom (i.e., negative beta func-
tion (g) < 0), dynamical mass generation, existence of instanton solution, no phase
transition for any value of coupling constant (i.e., one phase), etc. this similarity
between two theories can be understood from this correspondence,

qcd4  t qf t4  g/h nlsm2.

(5.7)

existence of 2d instanton is guaranteed for any n, because 2(su(n)/u(1)n 1) =
1(u(1)n 1) = zn 1.

for g = su(2), g/h nlsm is nothing but the o(3) nlsm. for the planar wilson

loop, the evaluation of the expectation value hit qf t in tqft4

tqft4 :z 1

t qf t4z [du(x)]xr4 exp(st qf t4[u])p(u)h(u)

is reduced to that in the coset g/h nlsm2

g/h nlsm2 :z 1

n lsm2z [dn(x)]xr2 exp(sn lsm2[n])p(u)h(u),

where we have used the notation (4.42) with

h(u)

p(u)

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

in qcd the scalar eld is not included as an elementary eld, but it appears as
a composite eld according to (5.6). the unit vector n(x) plays the same role as the
monopole scalar eld (x) which describes the t hooft-polyakov monopole [53, 54],
for g = su(2)

na(x)  a(x) :=

a(x)

|(x)| := qa(x)a(x).

then it is shown that in the limit of large wilson loop two string tensions agree with
each other,  = abel, since

1

a(c) (cid:20)lndw c[a]ey m4  lndw c[a]et qf t4(cid:21)  0 (a(c)  ).

(5.16)

here we have identied the deformation with the perturbative one. in other words,
for the large and (non-intersecting) planar wilson loop, the full string tension  is
saturated by the diagonal string tension abel. this explains the abelian dominance
and magnetic monopole dominance.

5.4 step 4: instanton calculus

the whole problem is reduced to calculating the diagonal wilson loop in nlsm2,

dw c[a]en lsm2

= dei2jqsen lsm2

d2z n  (n  n). (5.17)
note that the integrand of qs is the instanton density in nlsm2. therefore, qs
counts the number of instantons minus that of anti-instantons inside the area s( r2)
bounded by the wilson loop c. this suggests that the quark connement follows from
the condensation of topological soliton, the magnetic monopole.

, qs =

in this step we have employed the naive instanton calculus to calculate the di-
agonal wilson loop. in the dilute gas approximation the two-dimensional instanton
contributions are summing up according to

(5.18)

where the action of nlsm2 is replaced by (n+ + n)s1(g) using the numbers of in-
stanton and anti-instanton n+, n and the action for one instanton s1(g) = 42/g2
in nlsm2. thus the (innite dimensional) functional integral measure [dn(x)]xr2
has been replaced with the (nite dimensional) integration with respect to the col-
lective coordinates, zi (position of the instanton) and i (size of the instanton). such
reduction of degrees of freedom in the functional integration is a common feature in
tqft as shown in section 7.

this leads to the area law of the diagonal wilson loop and the non-zero diagonal

string tension abel for half odd integer j or the fractional charge q.

23

5.5 area law and quark connement

in the framework of the deformation of a tqft for the yang-mills theory, the non-
zero string tension  in qcd4 follows from the non-zero diagonal string tension abel
in nlsm2. the problem of proving area law in qcd4 is reduced to the corresponding
problem in nlsm2.

all the above steps are exact except for the instanton calculus of the wilson loop
in nlsm2. for suciently large and planar wilson loop, it was shown [12, 13] that
the string tension is given by

 = 2bes1 [1  cos (2j)] , s1 =

42
g2 ,

(5.19)

where b is a constant with the mass-squared dimension coming from the integration

nlsm2.

2, 3

2, 5

the result (5.19) shows that for half odd integers j = 1

2 is conned, while the adjoint fermion j = 1 can not be conned.

over the instanton size r d() and s1 = 42/g2 is the action for one instanton in
2,  , the wilson loop
exhibits area law for suciently large wilson loop c, whereas the area law and the
linear potential disappears for integers j = 1, 2, 3,  . therefore, the fundamental
fermion j = 1
in the above formulation using the ma gauge, it is the compact residual abelian
group that plays the essential role in evaluating the gauge invariant quantity. this
feature is very similar to the situation in the lattice gauge theory. in fact, the result
(5.19) is a consequence of the periodicity (or compactness) of the residual abelian
gauge group, i.e., maximal torus group u(1) of su(2), in the variable u after the
ma gauge is chosen. on the other hand, the gauge degrees of freedom for the non-
compact eld v have been completely xed by the gauge xing condition of lorentz
type. the explicit expression (5.19) depends on the approximation taken in the
instanton calculus, the periodicity of the string tension (hence the absence of string
tension for j = 1, 2,  ) does not depend on the approximation.
it is the perturbative part that gives the running of the coupling constant g. the
running is governed by the renormalization group beta function (g). the usual
yang-mills4 theory exhibits asymptotic freedom, e.g., for g = su(nc) at one-loop
level,

(g) := 

dg()

d

b0
162 g()3 +    ,

= 

b0 =

11nc

> 0.

(5.20)

in our framework, the correct beta function is derived based on the bgfm, see [22,
11]. for the static potential v (r), the perturbative part gives a coulomb potential
contribution ()/r where () := g2()/4 runs according to the (g).

similar strategy can also be applied to qed4 (g = u(1)) to prove the existence of
strong coupling connement phase [14]. this follows from the existence of berezinski-
kosterlitz-thouless transition of the o(2) nlsm2. the corresponding steps are shown
as follows.

this result enables us to give another derivation of quark connement in qcd
based on the low-energy eective abelian gauge theory [11], see [15]. this viewpoint
is more interesting in the sense that the connement-deconnement transition can be
discussed within the same framework.

5.6 remarks and unresolved issues

the dilute gas approximation can be improved. more systematic instanton calcula-
tions enable us to identify an instanton solution with the coulomb gas of vortices
[55, 56, 57, 58, 59]. consequently, the low-energy eective abelian gauge theory
belongs to the strong coupling phase where the quark connement is realized, see
[15].

the absence of intermediate casimir scaling region (i.e.,  = 0 for integer j) may
be due to our simplied treatment of the instanton size. in order to obtain the result
(5.19) we have treated the instanton as if it is exactly a point-like object in the dilute
gas approximation. the casimir scaling will be explained by taking into account the
size eect of the instanton, as performed for the center vortex by greensite et al. [60].
recent investigations show that the qcd vacuum is a dual super conductor caused
by the condensation of magnetic monopole and that the low-energy eective gauge
theory is given the dual ginzburg-landau theory. however, numerical simulations
claim that the dual superconductor is near type i, rather than type ii, see [3]. this
result seems to contradicts with the analytical studies.

it is desirable to extend the above analyses into more general gauge groups. the

case of g = su(3) will be discussed in forthcoming paper in detail.

5.7 a proposal of numerical calculations

some of the implications from the above strategy will be checked by direct numerical
simulations on the lattice. due to diculties of dening supersymmetry on the lattice,
it might be impossible to check directly the equivalence between the 4d tqft and
the 2d nlsm. nevertheless, it is desirable to check the following statements:

25

1. validity of perturbative deformation of tqft: the expectation value of the

(5.22)

two string tensions abel and  agree with each other.

2. validity of instanton calculus: only the instanton contribution in nlsm2 is

sucient to recover the abelian string tension, abel.

3. existence of the scale: the asymptotic scaling holds for the abelian string

tension abel calculated from the nlsm2.

the results will prove or disprove validity of our strategy of deriving quark conne-
ment.

6 gauge xing and gluon mass

6.1 a naive ma gauge

a simple but ad hoc way to give the mass for the o-diagonal gluon is to introduce
the following mass term to the yang-mills action,

sm = z ddxtrg/h (cid:18)1

2

m2aa(cid:19) .

(6.1)

this introduce the mass of the o-diagonal gluons in the tree level and this explicitly
break the gauge invariance corresponding to g/h. indeed, the mass term (6.1) is
derived as a gauge xing term as follows. the simplest ma gauge where the o-
diagonal part is made as small as possible will be the following gauge,

in order to write the gauge-xing action, we must introduce the vector auxiliary eld
b and the vector fp ghost c and anti-ghost c, so that

f a[a] := aa

 = 0.

(6.2)

sgf = z ddx ibtrg/h (cid:20) c(cid:18)a +


2

b(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

where the nilpotent brst transformation is constructed as 5

ba = c,
bc = 0,
b c = ib,
bb = 0.

(6.3)

(6.4)

5 this brst transformation does not leave the yang-mills action invariant, unless the equation

of motion is used. so, it is unusual when we include the yang-mills action.

26

eliminating the auxiliary eld b, we reproduce the mass term,

sgf = z d4x trg/h "m2



2 a(x)a(x) + i c(x)c(x)# ,

(6.5)

where we have put m2
 = 1/. 6 in four-dimensions, the parameter m looks like
a mass which is arbitrary and can not be determined. the brst transformation is
highly unusual, since it corresponds to the gauge transformation much larger than the
 has the same number of indices as aa
su(n) gauge transformation. note that c a
 .
hence we can use c a
 to obtain the vacuous theory. the
ghost eld c a
 has its own remaining ghost symmetry, parameterized by the ghost
eld, a, the ghost for ghost, so the ghosts themselves require more gauge xing. note
that the gauge xing condition (6.2) does not allow the topological soliton, since it is
linear in the eld.

(6.7)

since a = uu  +   . this is similar to a piece of the eective theory for the
low-energy qcd proposed by faddeev and niemi [61] based on chos works [62].

6.2 the ma gauge

the naive ma gauge above should be compared with the ma gauge. the ma gauge

f a[] := (ab  ab33)b

 := dab[3]b


(a, b = 1, 2)

(6.8)

is obtained by minimizing the r[au ] with respect to the gauge rotation u where

r[a] := z ddx trg/h   k

2a(x)a(x)! ,

(6.9)

where k is a constant. the ma gauge xing leads to the gauge-xing action (4.37)
where the gauge xing parameter is arbitrary at this stage. in our formulation, we
demand the supersymmetry [12] of the gauge xing action. then the dimensional
reduction [31] occurs as a spontaneous breaking of the supersymmetry (as explained
below). this symmetry requirement has determined the form of the gauge-xing term
(4.39) and the result is independent from the coecient k in r[ cala]. the explicit
action (4.39) after taking the brst transformation is rather complicated and does

(6.11)

where x = (z, x)  rd and z  rd2, x  r2, a = 1,   , d  2. hence, the
ma gauge leads to the unusual mass term, m(x) = m(z, x) = 22(x). the mass
is anisotropic and the gauge eld is massive only in d  2 dimensions. however,
the choice of the (d-2)-dimensional subspace is arbitrary. for d = 4, the equivalent
action is given in the form of two-dimensional nlsm,

sgf = z d2z " 2/g2

2

an(z)  an(z) + trg/h (cid:16)i2 c(z)c(z)(cid:17)# .

(6.12)

it is known that the two-dimensional nlsm exhibits dynamical mass generation, that
is to say, the spectrum has a mass gap, although the initial lagrangian does not have
the usual mass term. in this sense, in the subspace r2 the gauge eld can have the
mass. 7

6.3 spontaneous breakdown of hidden supersymmetry

a step of dimensional reduction is a little bit subtle. in the tqft, the action is brst
exact by denition, so the partition function and the expectation value of the gauge

kugo [32] in the context of color connement.

28

invariant operator do not depend on the coupling constant. however, the nlsmd2
obtained after the dimensional reduction from the tqftd is not topological and may
depend on the coupling constant. this seems at rst glance inconsistent.

this problem will be resolved as follows. the dimensional reduction is a con-
sequence of the hidden supersymmetry in tqft obtained in the ma gauge, see
[12]. here the supersymmetry implies the invariance under the super rotation in the
superspace (x, , ), i.e., the orthsymplectic group osp(d/2). the advantage of in-
troducing the superspace is to give a geometric meaning to the brst transformation.
in fact, the brst symmetry becomes the translational invariance in the superspace.
the brst charges, qb, qb are generators of the translations in the direction of the
grassmann variables , , i.e., 
  in the process of the dimensional reduction we
can choose arbitrary two dimensions r2 from d dimensions (x1,   , xd)  rd, since
there is no privileged direction. however, once we have chosen specic two dimen-
sions, the rotation symmetry is partially broken by this procedure.
in this sense,
the dimensional reduction causes the spontaneous breakdown of the supersymmetry
hidden in tqft.

 , 

this becomes more clear in evaluating the expectation value of an operator based
on the dimensional reduction. for this strategy to work, the support of all the oper-
ators must be contained in the (d-2) dimensional subspace to which the dimensional
reduction occurs. such an expectation value is obtained from the generating func-
tional by restricting the external source j (x, , ) to a (d-2)-dimensional subspace,
i.e., by putting x =  =  = 0, see section iv of the paper [12]. of course, when a pair
of quark and anti-quark exists, it is convenient to choose the (d-2)-dimensional sub-
space so that their trajectories are contained in the subspace for d  4. consequently,
(d-2)-dimensional bosonic theory is no longer topological. by putting x =  =  = 0,
the bsrt symmetries (i.e., translational invariances in the direction of , ) is bro-
ken. the hilbert space of the (d-2)-dimensional bosonic theory is dierent from the
original d-dimensional supersymmetric theory. so the brst charges qb, qb do not
annihilate the vacuum of the reduced bosonic theory. thus, the nlsm2 is obtained
without contradiction from tqft4 by dimensional reduction.

finally we consider the above result from a dierent point of view. we consider
the 4 +  dimensional yang-mills theory and 2 +  dimensional nlsm. for  > 0,
both theories have two phases, the disordered (high-temperature) phase in the strong
coupling region g > gc and the ordered (low-temperature) phase in the weak coupling
region g < gc where gc  o(). the beta function is expected to be positive for
0 < g < gc and negative for g > gc. see fig. 2(a). as  decreases, the ordered phases
shrinks and nally disappears (gc()  0 as   0). in this limit, the beta function
becomes negative for any value of g, leading to the asymptotic freedom for ym4
and nlsm2. see fig. 2(b).
in this limit, the massless nambu-goldstone particle
associated to the spontaneous breaking of g to h also disappear, as examined by
bardeen, lee and shrock [63]. for d = 4, thus, the massless nambu-goldstone
particle associated with the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry, if any, can not
exist in two dimensions.

7 geometric meaning of gauge xing term

in quantizing the gauge theory, the procedure of gauge xing is indispensable to avoid
innities due to overcounting of gauge equivalent congurations. so in the quantized
gauge theory we must treat the gauge xing term seriously as well as the gauge eld
action. already at the level of classical theory, it is well known that the gauge theory
has a geometric meaning, i.e., gauge theory is nothing but the geometry of connection.
in this section we want to emphasize that the gauge xing term may have a geometric
meaning from a viewpoint of global topology.

7.1 fp determinant

the usual procedure of gauge xing is to insert the identity

1 = f p [a]z [du]yx

(f a[au ])

into the functional integral

z = z [dau ] exp(sy m [au ]).

then we obtain

z = z [du]z [dau ]f p [au ]yx

(f a[au ]) exp(sy m [au ]),

(7.1)

(7.2)

(7.3)

since f p is gauge invariant, f p [a] = f p [au ]. the f p is calculated as follows.

(f a[a])

f p [a]1 = z [d]yx
= z [d]xk
= xk



 (  k)
| det(cid:16) f a[a]
(cid:17)|=k

1

| det(cid:16) f a[a]



(cid:17) |=k

.

(7.4)

when this result in the presence of gribov copies is substituted into (7.3), the brst
formulation does not work. even when there is no gribov copies, we have the absolute
value of the determinant,

f p [a] = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

det  f a[a]



!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=k

.

(7.5)

this expression is dicult to be used. therefore, we do not adopt this approach.
rather we start from the expression,

z = z [du]z [dau ]yx

(f a[au ]) det f a[a]



! exp(sy m [au ]).

(7.6)

such a formulation was proposed by fujikawa [64]. we will show that such a proposal
is very natural from the viewpoint of global topology.

(b)

figure 3: various two-dimensional surfaces with dierent topology. the euler number
 of the two-dimensional surface is determined by the topology of the surface, i.e.,
 = 2  2g for the surface with the genus g. the morse index p = (1)p is a local
quantity which is determined at the critical points (black dots in the gures) of the
morse function. the euler number is equal to the sum of the morse indices over all
the critical points, i.e.,  = n0  n1 + n2. for example, it is easy to see that (a)  = 2
for the sphere s2, (b)  = 0 for the torus t 2.

7.2 gauge xing and global topology
in the following, we use the notation a = {aa
x, , a. if we take the gauge xing condition

 (x)} where a denotes collectively

f a[] :=

f ()
a = 0,

the partition function in the gauge theory is given by

z := z [d]ya
= z [d]ya

(f a[]) det  f a[]
a ! det  2f ()
 f ()

b ! es[]
ab! es[].

(7.7)

(7.8)

let m be the manifold m of eld congurations {a} and f a continuous function
from m to r, f : m  r. in order to see the geometric meaning of the gauge xing
term, we consider the limit s[]  0, i.e., only the gauge xing and the corresponding
fp ghost term,

g := z [d]ya

 f ()

a ! det  2f ()
ab! .

(7.9)

31

hence, from the property of the dirac delta function, we have

g = z [d]xk
= xk:f (k)=0

 (  k)
| det(cid:16) 2f ()
ab(cid:17)|=k
sign
det  2f ()

ab!=k

det  2f ()
ab!

 ,

where k is a solution of f () = 0 or f a[] = 0. thus we obtain
p := sign(det hf ) = (1)p,

p,

g = xp:f (p)=0

where hf is the hessian dened by

hf :=

2f ()
ab .

(7.10)

(7.11)

(7.12)

(7.13)

for a smooth function f , the hessian is a symmetric matrix and hence its eigenvalues
are all real. the index p is equal to the number of negative eigenvalues of the
hessian. note that  is an integer. in order to obtain this simple expression, the
existence of the fp determinant is indispensable. the function f is called the morse
function [65], if all the critical points p (i.e., f (p ) = 0) of f are non-degenerate,
i.e., det(hf ) 6= 0. for a nite dimensional case, it is known that all non-degenerate
critical points of f are isolated critical points, i.e., there is no other critical point in
the neighborhood of a critical point. whether the critical point is degenerate or non-
degenerate does not depend on how to choose the coordinate systems in the manifold
m of eld congurations {a}. a convenient way to see the above situation is to
use the standard form. the quantity  is obtained as the sum of the index p over
all the critical points, once the function f is given. see fig. 3 for a simple case of
two-dimensional surface m2. in that case, we have

(m2) = n0  n1 + n2,

(7.14)

where n0, n1, n2 are the total numbers of the minimal, saddle and maximum points
respectively.

for a given eld conguration a, we can consider the global topology. the
measure [d(x)] includes various eld congurations with various global topology,
each of which is characterized by an appropriate topological invariant. by repeating
the similar calculation, we obtain for the partition function,

z = xp:f (p)=0

pes[p] = xp:f (p)=0

(1)pes[p].

(7.15)

the two-dimensional case is rather simple, see fig. 3. the poincare-hopf theorem
for the two-dimensional surface states that  dened in (7.12) is equal to the euler
number  of the two-dimensional surface m2,

(m2) = 2  2g,

32

(7.16)

where g is the genus, i.e., number of handles. the morse index p or p is a local
quantity, but, the sum  given by (7.12) is determined only from the global topology
of the surface (7.16) without any local information. the poincare-hopf theorem gives
a bridge between the local geometry and global topology:

local  xp

(local index)p = topological invariant  global.

(7.17)

this is a very important result for our purpose. because, by deforming the surface
in a continuous way, the location of the critical point change and the morse index
at the new critical point may also change, but the total sum of the morse index is a
topological invariant which is determined only by the global topology of the surface
irrespective of the way of continuous deformation.

it is well known that the two-dimensional manifold is completely classied by the
genus or the euler number. this is not the case in higher dimensions. in fact, we
must treat the innite dimensional case. even in the innite dimensional case, for a
specic eld conguration m 
) will be determined.
then it is expected that the g is expressed as a sum of topological invariants,

, a topological invariant q(m 

g = xq

wqq(m 

).

in view of this, the functional we have chosen to derive the ma gauge,

r[] := z ddx trg/h (cid:18)1

2

(x)(x)(cid:19)

(7.18)

(7.19)

is considered to be a morse function. indeed, the ma gauge condition is obtained as
the gradient of the morse function r with respect to the large gauge transformation,
(7.20)

r[]

= f [].



the topology change in the eld congurations may be caused by the large (or nite)
gauge transformation allowed in the measure [du], since the measure is invariant
under the global gauge rotation u  eiu. thus, the gauge xing and the associated
fp term when integrated out by the functional measure [d] can have a geometric
meaning which is related to the global topology of the eld congurations. the morse
function is a tool of probing the global topology allowed in the functional space of
the eld congurations by gathering the local information at all the critical points.
the partition function of yang-mills theory is given by

zy m [0] = xp:f (p)=0

pesef f [p] = xp:f (p)=0

(1)pesef f [p].

(7.21)

finally, we consider how  changes when we change the morse function f . in two-
dimensional case, (m2) is determined by the topology of manifold m2 irrespective
of the choice of morse function f . if this feature survives in the innite dimensional
case, we can conclude that the global topology of the yang-mills theory does not
depend on the way of gauge xing.

7.3 morse function and brst transformation

by introducing the auxiliary eld b and the fp ghost and anti-ghost elds, , , we
can write

 := z [d]ya

(f a[]) det  f a[]

b ! = z [d][db][d][d]esgf [],

(7.22)

the critical point f [] := f ()

 = 0 corresponds to the xed point of brst transfor-
mation. therefore, the integration r [d](f [])    is localized on the xed point of

brst transformation. this is a characteristic feature of topological quantum eld
theory. the condition f a[] = 0 is regarded as a non-linear partial dierential equa-
tion. the space of parameters characterizing the solution of this equation is called
the moduli space. in the tqft, the above argument shows that the innite dimen-
sional functional integral reduces to nite dimensional integral on moduli space. for
example, for the yang-mills instanton with q = k, dimm = 8k < .

8 conclusion and discussion

in this paper we have derived a reformulation of the yang-mills theory based on
the background eld method. the reformulation identies the yang-mills theory

34

as a deformation of a topological quantum eld theory as proposed in [12]. the
background eld is given by a topological soliton.

in order to show quark connement, the condensation of a topological soliton is
necessary to occur. this has been actually derived by summing up the topological
soliton contributions, provided that the topological soliton is described by the topolog-
ical eld theory. the topological eld theory has been derived from the gauge xing
term corresponding to the nonlinear gauge xing condition, the maximal abelian
gauge. the maximal abelian gauge implies that the topological soliton in question
is nothing but the magnetic monopole current, the four-dimensional version of the
magnetic monopole. the result ensures that the quark connement is realized in the
qcd vacuum as a dual superconductor. furthermore, we have proposed a numerical
simulation which is able to conrm the validity of the above reformulation.

we have discussed a novel mechanism for the mass generation for the gauge eld,
i.e., dynamical mass generation as the dimensional reduction which causes the spon-
taneous breakdown of the brst symmetry in the topological eld theory. moreover,
we have suggested that the gauge xing action may have the geometric meaning from
the view point of global topology by making use of the morse function.

in this paper we have restricted our consideration to the maximal abelian gauge
where the residual gauge group h is the maximal torus group of the non-abelian
gauge group g (h = u(1)n 1 for g = su(n)), although our formulation can be
applied to any choice of h. therefore the topological soliton is given by the abelian
magnetic monopole. however, it is possible to consider other choices for the residual
gauge group h (especially for g = su(n)(n  3)) which leads to the topologi-
cal soliton other than the abelian magnetic monopole, e.g., non-abelian magnetic
monopole, center vortex. either choice will lead to the quark connement. from
the viewpoint of color connement, however, the maximal torus group for h is not
necessarily the best choice. the details will be given in the subsequent paper [66].

the ansatz (a.3) is the same as the multi-instanton solution of t hooft type. the

-symbols are self-dual in the vector indices,

(a.10)

the instanton solution is obtained assuming [, ]f = 0, since the instanton is the
point defect in four dimensions. for the magnetic monopole current (the line defect)
in four dimensions, [, ]f 6= 0 can happen, see e.g. appendix of [11]. such a
possibility has not been studied so far.

the n-instanton solution in the singular gauge is given by

(a.11)

where zi is the position and i is the size of the i-th instanton (k = 1,   , n), and all
the instantons have the same color orientations. for the n-instanton, f = ln  and 
are singular at n points, x = zk(k = 1,   , n). the gauge potential reads

|x| := qx4x4 + xaxa.

(a.14)

(a.15)

(a.16)

since the self-duality and eld equations are gauge covariant, the gauge transformed
potential also satises them. this holds also for the monopole equation (a.1). by the
appropriate inverse gauge transformation u, we can get rid of the singularity and the
resulting solution vanishes at x = z. in fact, the singularity at x = z can be removed
by a singular gauge transformation,

a

(x) = u(y)[a(x) + ]u (y),

and the non-singular solution is obtained [42]

where -symbol is dened by

(a.19)

indeed, the solution (a.18) has no singularity at any x. the non-singular solution
approaches the pure gauge as x  ,

this solution is similar to the witten solution [38] for the multi-instanton with cylin-
drical symmetry, see section v of [12].

it is known [67] that various well-known equations in lower dimensions are ob-
tained by (dimensional) reduction of the self-dual equation in four dimensions. for
example, if the eld is static, i.e., 0a = 0, the identication a0(x0, x) = (x) with
x = (x1, x2, x3) leads to the bogomolnyi equation describing the magnetic monopole
in three dimensions,

fij(x) = ijkdk(x)

(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3).

(a.24)

in this sense, the self-dual equation contains a kind of magnetic monopole.

under the ansatz (a.3), the self-dual equation (3.11) for the instanton is satised
only for the function f given by (a.11) which is also a solution of the yang-mills
eld equation (3.1). the same ansatz gives a solution of the monopole equation for
arbitrary f which is not necessarily the solution of the yang-mills eld equation. the
general solution of the self-dual equation is given according to the method of atiyah,
drinfeld, hitchin and mannin (adhm). to authors knowledge, the general solution
is not known for the monopole equation (a.1). in order for the solution of (a.1) to
give a magnetic monopole, we must check whether the solution gives non-trivial k.
the explicit monopole solution was constructed in [25] and [24]. only the solution of
brower, orginos and tan (bot) [24] satises r[a] < . for more details, see [24].

b comparison with the cho-faddeev-niemi vari-

ables

if we choose

r[a] := z ddx trg(cid:18)1

2a(x)a(x)(cid:19) ,

(b.25)

the variation is given by

r[a] := z ddx trg (a(x)a(x)) = z ddx trg (a(x)d[a](x))
= z ddx trg (d[a]a(x)  (x)) ,

(b.26)

(b.27)

where we have used the partial integration by parts. the requirement r[a] = 0
for arbitrary  yields 0 = d[a]a(x) = a(x). this is the familiar lorentz gauge
which is a linear gauge. the linear equation a(x) = 0 can not have a soliton
solution.
another way to obtain r[a] = 0 is to restrict the gauge transformation  such
that d[a](x) = 0. this equation is solved for a, see [62] . for example, in the
case of g = su(2),

d[a](x) := a(x) + gabcac

 (x)b(x) = 0.

(b.28)

a solution is given by

 (x) = aa(x) 
aa

2g

abcb(x)c(x),

(b.29)

where a is arbitrary abelian vector eld and a is chosen to be a unit vector in
three dimensions, a(x)a(x) = 1.
in this way, it is possible to obtain a subset
of a non-abelian gauge theory. this formalism gives essentially the same result as
the partial gauge xing, the ma gauge. the details will be given in a forthcoming
publication.
