discussion anomaly cancellation, let us summarize done clarify role background connection a0 context. anomaly obtained residual m5brane anomaly generated via descent equations 8form p2(n ), i.e. second pontryagin class normal bundle. reducible connections p2(n ) splits square pfaan. splitting thought correspond section v. therefore write n = lv n v (4.1) point remark that, p2(n ) consider

cancel generated q(v, fb , fb) given (3.7). thanks factorization (4.2) previous section able derive eq.(3.7) anomaly, section able cancel via suitable counterterm. point however, partially anticipated previous section, take two dierent attitudes. rst attitude based idea one restrict subgroup rel- evant dieomorphisms x which, map w w n n , also preserve splitting n = lv n particular preserve v. let us call v, i.e. 12 subgroup dif fv(x, n ). safely pick background connection a0 n v: remain connection transformed n v, long dieomorphisms considered dif fv(x, n ). correspond automorphisms principal

therefore , least collar represents part nearest w , retains physical information too. words, would seem physical information 5brane stored w also . sounds curiously similar proposed dierent context

reducible connection another reducible connection. problem either background connection a0 background vector v0, remain xed throughout. finally anomaly given (3.7). 4.1 counterterm basis anomaly
