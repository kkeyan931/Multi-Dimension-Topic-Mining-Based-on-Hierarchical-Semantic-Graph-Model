abstract

we consider chiral gauge theories dened over a xed four-dimensional spacetime manifold with
a cartesian product structure for at least one compact spatial dimension. for a simple setup,
we calculate the eective gauge eld action obtained from integrating out the chiral fermions,
while maintaining gauge invariance. due to a combination of infrared and ultraviolet eects,
there appears a cpt-odd term in the eective gauge eld action. this cpt anomaly could
occur in chiral gauge theories relevant to elementary particle physics, provided the spacetime
manifold has the appropriate topology. two possible applications for cosmology are discussed.

1 introduction

the cpt theorem is one of the most important results in at-spacetime quantum eld
theory [1, 2, 3]. the theorem states that the combined operation (cpt) of charge conju-
gation (c), parity reection (p) and time reversal (t) is an invariance of local relativistic
quantum eld theory, even if some of the separate invariances do not hold. any cpt
violation is, therefore, believed to require fundamentally dierent physics, for example
quantum gravity [4, 5] or strings [6]. it may, then, come as a surprise that a particular
class of local relativistic quantum eld theories has given an indication of cpt violation
[7].

the specic theories considered in ref. [7] are non-abelian chiral gauge theories with
one compact spatial dimension singled out by the prescribed four-dimensional spacetime
manifold m. an example would be su(3) yang-mills theory [8] with a single triplet of left-
handed weyl fermions [9], dened over the at spacetime manifold m = ir3  s1, which
corresponds to the usual minkowski spacetime with one spatial coordinate compactied to
a circle. the perturbative chiral gauge anomalies of this theory [1013] can be cancelled
by the introduction of an octet of elementary pseudoscalar elds with the standard gauged
wess-zumino term in the action [14, 15]. there remains a nonperturbative su(3) gauge
anomaly [16], which is similar to, but not the same as, the witten su(2) gauge anomaly
[17]. in this case, however, there exists a local counterterm for the action which restores
su(3) gauge invariance, but at the price of lorentz noninvariance and cpt violation
[7]. in other words, the remaining non-abelian chiral gauge anomaly is transmuted into
a cpt anomaly. (the situation is analogous to that of certain three-dimensional non-
abelian gauge theories with massless fermions, where gauge invariance is restored at the
price of p and t violation and the non-abelian gauge anomaly is transmuted into the
so-called parity anomaly [1823].)

the particular counterterm presented in ref. [7] is the spacetime integral of a chern-
simons density [24] involving three of the four gauge potentials. (the precise denition
will be given later.) such a term obviously violates local lorentz invariance. also, the
integrand of the counterterm is cpt-odd, whereas the standard yang-mills action density
is cpt-even. this lorentz and cpt noninvariance would show up, to rst order, as a
direction-dependent, but wavelength-independent, rotation of the linear polarization of a
plane wave of gauge elds traveling in vacuo [25].

we have obtained some heuristic arguments of why the counterterm must violate
lorentz and cpt invariance, but the uniqueness of the counterterm has not been estab-
lished. if, on the other hand, the non-abelian chiral gauge anomaly is really as discussed
above, then the eective gauge eld action due to the chiral fermions, formulated and
regularized in a gauge-invariant manner, must already exhibit some sign of cpt viola-
tion (and lorentz noninvariance).
it is the goal of the present paper to establish this
cpt violation. maintaining chiral gauge invariance, we will nd for spacetime manifolds
with the appropriate cartesian product structure a cpt-violating term in the eective

1

gauge eld action which is precisely equal to the counterterm presented in ref. [7]. this
cpt-violating term can appear in anomaly-free chiral gauge theories but not in vectorlike
gauge theories such as quantum electrodynamics.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we give the setup of the problem and
establish our notation. in section 3, we choose some simple background gauge potentials
and nd a chern-simons term in the eective gauge eld action. the calculation applies
to both abelian and non-abelian chiral gauge groups, provided the theory is free of chiral
gauge anomalies. in section 4, we show that the chern-simons term found violates cpt.
in other words, these particular chiral gauge eld theories have a cpt anomaly if gauge
invariance is maintained. in section 5, we give some generalizations of our basic result.
also, we exhibit a class of chiral gauge theories which necessarily have the cpt anomaly,
as long as the spacetime manifold has the appropriate topology. remarkably, the so-
called standard model of elementary particle physics (with three families of quarks and
leptons) can be embedded in some of these anomalous theories. in section 6, nally, we
present some remarks on how the cpt theorem is circumvented and discuss two possible
applications of the cpt anomaly.

2 setup

for deniteness, we take spacetime to be the at euclidean manifold

m = ir3  s1 ,

(2.1)

with cartesian coordinates xm  ir3, m = 1, 2, 3, and x4  s1. at the end of the
calculation, we can make the wick rotation [26] from euclidean to lorentzian metric
signature, with x4 corresponding to a compact spatial coordinate and x1, say, to the time
coordinate. the length of the circle in the 4-direction is denoted by l. throughout this
paper, latin indices k, l, m, etc. run over the coordinate labels 1, 2, 3, and greek indices
, , , etc. over 1, 2, 3, 4. repeated coordinate (and internal) indices are summed over.
also, natural units are used for which c = h = k = 1.

we will rst consider non-abelian chiral gauge theories with a single irreducible rep-
resentation of massless left-handed fermions. specically, we take the standard chiral
yang-mills theory [8, 9] with gauge group g = so(10) and left-handed weyl fermions
in the complex representation r l = 16. (this particular model may have some rele-
vance for elementary particle physics, as part of a so-called grand-unied theory. see
refs. [27, 28] and references therein.) the left-handed fermion eld is then li(x), with
a spinor index  = 1, 2, and an internal symmetry index i = 1, . . . , 16. the gauge
potentials are a(x)  e aa
(x) t a, with e the gauge coupling constant and t a, a = 1, . . .
, 45, the anti-hermitian generators of the lie group so(10) in the representation chosen,
normalized by tr (t at b) =  1

2 ab.

in this paper, we are interested in the eective gauge eld action obtained from inte-
grating out the chiral fermions, while maintaining gauge invariance. formally, we have
the following functional integral [26]:

exp {w[a ]} = z d

l dl expni wh 

l, l, aio ,

for the euclidean weyl action

i wh 

l, l, ai = zm

d4x 

l i

 ( + a) l ,

(2.2)

(2.3)

with 
  ( im, 1 ) dened in terms of the 2  2 pauli matrices m and the 2  2
identity matrix 1 . the so(10) chiral gauge theory is anomaly free [12, 13, 16, 17] and
the eective gauge eld action is invariant under local gauge transformations,

 w [ g (a + d) g1 ] =  w [a ] ,

g(x)  g ,

(2.4)

with d the exterior derivative for dierential forms (dg  g/x dx) and a  a dx
a one-form taking values in the lie algebra of the dening representation.

if the chiral gauge theory considered is not anomaly free (for example, the theory
mentioned in the introduction, with g = su(3) and r l = 3), then the theory has to be
modied in order to make it gauge invariant. one way to restore gauge invariance is by
averaging over the gauge orbits,

exp { [a ]}  z dh expn  w [ h (a + d) h1 ]o .

(2.5)

but the interpretation of the resulting theory with the dimensionless variables h(x) 
g is not entirely clear [29]. another way to restore gauge invariance is by introducing
further fermions, which cancel the chiral anomalies of the original fermions [13]. in section
5, we will discuss some of these theories with reducible fermion representations. all of
these complications are, however, not necessary for the anomaly-free chiral gauge theory
considered here, which has the gauge group g = so(10) and the fermion representation
r l = 16.

at this point, there is no need to be explicit about the regularization of the eective
gauge eld action  w [a ]. one possible regularization would be the introduction of a
spacetime lattice cuto, which (temporarily?) sacrices lorentz invariance but keeps the
gauge and chiral invariances intact. (see refs. [30, 31] and references therein.) this last
condition on the regularization method is important, since we intend to look for symmetry
violations being forced upon us by maintaining exact gauge invariance in a theory with
genuine chiral fermions.

3 calculation

as discussed in the introduction, our goal is to establish the presence of a cpt-violating
term in the eective gauge eld action for the theory dened in section 2. the strategy
is to simplify the calculation as much as possible. we, therefore, take the case of x4-
independent so(10) gauge potentials, with the one gauge potential corresponding to the
special direction (here, x4  s1 for the euclidean spacetime manifold m = ir3  s1)
vanishing altogether,

am(~x, x4) = am(~x) , a4(~x, x4) = a4(~x) = 0 .

(3.1)

also, the gauge potentials considered vanish on the boundary of a ball b3 embedded in
ir3, and outside of it,

am(~x) = 0

for

|~x|  r ,

(3.2)

with r a xed radius which can be taken to innity at the end of the calculation.

the left-handed fermion eld l in the complex representation r l = 16 of so(10)
l in the conjugate representation can be expanded in

and the independent fermion eld 
fourier modes

l(~x, x4) =


l(~x, x4) =





xn=
xn=

e+2inx4/l n(~x) ,

e2inx4/l 

n(~x) .

the weyl action (2.3) for the gauge potentials (3.1) then becomes

i w =



xn= zir3

d3x l 

n(cid:16) m (m + am)  2n/l(cid:17) n .

redening the two independent sets of spinor elds

n(~x)  i l n(~x) , 

n(~x)  

n(~x) ,

the action reads

i w =





xn= zir3
i 3h 
xn=



d3x 

n(cid:16) i m(m + am) + i 2n/l(cid:17) n

n, n, ai .

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

we have thus obtained an innite set of three-dimensional euclidean dirac elds n(~x)
with masses 2n/l, all of which interact with the same three-dimensional gauge poten-
tials am(~x). (this is, of course, reminiscent of kaluza-klein theory, which reduces ve
spacetime dimensions to four. see refs. [32, 28] and references therein.)

4

for the special gauge potentials (3.1), the eective action (2.2) now factorizes to

expnw[ a ]o 



yn=(cid:18) z d

n dn expni 3h 

n, n, aio (cid:19) ,

(3.7)

with the three-dimensional action i 3 as dened in (3.6). each factor in (3.7) can be regu-
larized separately by the introduction of appropriate three-dimensional pauli-villars elds
[33, 26]. this ultraviolet regularization preserves the restricted gauge invariance

n  ur(g) n ,

a (r)

m  ur(g)(cid:16) a (r)

m + m(cid:17) u 1

r (g) ,

g(~x)  g ,

(3.8)

with ur the appropriate unitary representation for the fermions (here, r = 16 and g =
so(10)) and gauge functions g(~x) = 1 for |~x|  r. even though this is not the full gauge
invariance (2.4) of the theory, it turns out to be sucient for our purpose (see section 4).

in addition to the ultraviolet divergences in the separate factors of (3.7), which are
regularized by the corresponding three-dimensional pauli-villars elds, there are also
infrared divergences in the n = 0 factor. these infrared divergences can be regularized
by imposing antiperiodic boundary conditions for the dirac (and pauli-villars) elds on
the surface of the ball b3, where the gauge potentials (3.2) vanish.

the massive pauli-villars regulator elds for the n = 0 factor of (3.7), viewed as x4-in-
dependent four-dimensional elds, introduce a breaking of lorentz and cpt invariance in
the four-dimensional context. this breaking will show up later as a nite remnant in the
eective gauge eld action. (for the moment, it is an open question whether or not the
same happens for the lattice regularization mentioned in the last paragraph of section 2.)

for our calculation, it is sucient to introduce for each (anticommuting) eld n(~x)
with mass mn  2n/l a single (commuting) pauli-villars eld n(~x) with mass 0 for
n = 0 and n  mn + sign(n)  for n 6= 0, where  is taken to be positive. formally,
this gives for (3.7) the following product:

expnw[ a ]o  yk

k

k + i0   
yl=1

k + m 2
2
l

k + (ml + )2 ! ,

2

(3.9)

in terms of the real eigenvalues k of the massless three-dimensional dirac operator  i m
(m + am). the factors in (3.7) with n =  l, for l > 0, thus combine to give a real
contribution to the eective gauge eld action w[ a ]. moreover, it is clear that the
spectral ow [18, 21] of the full three-dimensional dirac operator as given in (3.6) can
occur only in the n = 0 sector (there is a mass gap for n 6= 0), and that the potential
non-abelian gauge anomaly [16], which shows up in the imaginary part of w[ a ], resides
there.

the imaginary part of the eective gauge eld action for massless three-dimensional
dirac fermions, with pauli-villars regularization to maintain gauge invariance, has already

5

been calculated [18, 21]. revisiting the perturbative calculation, we have for the n = 0
sector of our non-abelian so(10) gauge theory the one-loop result

 n=0

w [ a ]  izb3

d3x s0   cs[ a1, a2, a3 ] ,

simons density [24, 21]

(3.11)

with indices k, l, m, running over 1, 2, 3. here, klm is the completely antisymmetric
levi-civita symbol, normalized to 123 = +1, and akl  kal  lak + [ ak , al ] is the
eld strength tensor for the gauge potential am  e aa
m t a, with gauge coupling constant
e and anti-hermitian lie group generators t a, normalized by tr (t at b) =  1

2 ab.

the sign ambiguity s0 in (3.10) traces back to the parity-violating pauli-villars mass 0
used to regularize the ultraviolet divergences of the three-dimensional feynman diagrams.
(here, parity violation is meant in the three-dimensional sense. as will become clear in
the next section, three-dimensional parity corresponds to cpt in the four-dimensional
context [7].) the factor s0 in (3.10) comes, in fact, from a factor 0/|0| out of the
momentum integrals. the triangle diagram, for example, gives in the limit |0|  

2 z 

0

dq 4q2 0 (q2 + 2

0) (q2 + 2

0)3 = 0/|0|  s0 ,

(3.12)

with the explicit factor 0 (q2 +2
0) from the spinor trace in the integrand on the left-hand
side. it is also important that the infrared divergences of the three-dimensional feynman
diagrams without pauli-villars elds are not regularized by the introduction of a small
dirac mass 0, which would again violate parity invariance, but that they are kept under
control by the antiperiodic boundary conditions imposed on the fermions (turning the
momentum integrals into sums).

the essential conditions for the derivation of (3.10) are thus the requirement of gauge
invariance (3.8) and the control of infrared divergences in the n = 0 factor of (3.7). for
non-abelian gauge groups, there is, in addition to the local term (3.10) obtained in per-
turbation theory, also a nonlocal term in am(~x) which restores the full three-dimensional
gauge invariance (3.8), not just its innitesimal version. this nonlocal term vanishes,
however, for gauge potentials am(~x) suciently close to zero. see refs.
[21, 23] and
references therein.

the integral in (3.10) can be extended over the whole of 3-space, because the gauge
potentials am of (3.1), (3.2) vanish outside the ball b3. the gauge potentials am are also
x4-independent. insisting upon translation invariance, the expression (3.10) can then be
written as the following four-dimensional integral:

 n=0

w [ a ]  izir3

d3xz l

0

dx4 s0 (1 + a) 

l

 cs[ a1(~x), a2(~x), a3(~x) ] ,

(3.13)

with s0 =  1 as dened in (3.12) and parameter a = 0 for the simple non-abelian gauge
group considered up till now. the one-loop calculation for three-dimensional abelian
u(1) gauge potentials gives essentially the same result [18, 22], with the factor  in (3.10)
replaced by 2  and the parameter a in (3.13) set equal to 1.

the chern-simons term (3.13) is the main result of this paper. the result was obtained
for the particular chiral gauge theory with the gauge group g = so(10) and the fermion
representation r l = 16, but holds for an arbitrary simple compact lie group (or abelian
u(1) group) and an arbitrary nonsinglet irreducible fermion representation, as long as
the fermion representation is normalized appropriately and the complete theory is free of
chiral gauge anomalies (see section 5). in the next two sections, we will take a closer look
at this result and present some generalizations.

4 lorentz and cpt noninvariance

for the special gauge potentials (3.1), (3.2) and the euclidean spacetime manifold m =
ir3  s1, we have found in the previous section the emergence of a chern-simons term
(3.13) in the eective gauge eld action. the calculation, which relies on earlier results
for the three-dimensional parity anomaly, applies to both abelian and non-abelian gauge
groups, provided the chiral gauge anomalies cancel in the complete theory (see section
5).

for arbitrary gauge potentials a(~x, x4) which drop to 0 faster than r1 as r  |~x| 
 and which have trivial holonomies (see below), the eective action term (3.13) can be
written as the following local expression:

cslike[a ] = izir3
 ir3s 1

d3xz l

0

dx4 s0 (1 + a) 

l

 cs[a1(~x, x4), a2(~x, x4), a3(~x, x4) ], (4.1)

with the chern-simons density cs given by (3.11), an integer factor s0 =  1 dened in
(3.12), and an integer parameter a = 0 or 1 for a simple non-abelian gauge group or an
abelian u(1) gauge group, respectively. eq. (4.1), for simple non-abelian gauge groups,
is precisely equal to the counterterm presented in ref. [7]. the expression (4.1) is called
chern-simons-like, because a genuine topological chern-simons term exists only in an
odd number of dimensions [24]. remark that this chern-simons-like term (4.1) comes
from a combination of infrared (1/l) and ultraviolet (s0  0/|0|) eects.

the local chern-simons-like term (4.1) has the important property of invariance under
innitesimal four-dimensional gauge transformations. (this property would not hold if
the particular chern-simons density cs as given by (4.1) were replaced by, for exam-
0 dx4
am(~x, x4). of course, such an eective action term using the averaged gauge potentials
am would not be local either.) for simple compact connected lie groups g, there are

ple, cs[a1(~x), a2(~x), a3(~x) ], with the averaged gauge potentials am(~x)  l1r l

7

also large gauge transformations with a gauge function g = g(~x)  g corresponding to
a nontrivial element of the homotopy group 3(g) = zz. as mentioned in section 3,
there is a nonlocal term in the eective gauge eld action which restores invariance under
these nite gauge transformations, but this nonlocal term vanishes for gauge potentials
am(~x, x4) suciently close to zero. in addition, there are, for lie groups g = so(n  3)
or u(1) with homotopy group 1(g) 6= 0, large gauge transformations with gauge function
g = g(x4)  g, but the chern-simons-like term (4.1) is obviously invariant under these
particular nite gauge transformations.

turning to spacetime transformations, the eective action term (4.1) is clearly invariant
under translations. the chern-simons density in its integrand, though, involves only three
of the four gauge potentials a(x) and three of the six components of the eld strength
tensor a(x)  a  a + [ a , a ], which makes the eective gauge eld action
manifestly lorentz noninvariant. physically, this would, for example, lead to anisotropic
propagation (birefringence) of the gauge boson elds [25].

the path-ordered exponential integral (holonomy) tr h(~x)  tr p exp {r l

we are not able to determine the imaginary part of the eective gauge eld action
exactly. (the eective action might, for example, have some dependence on the trace of
0 dx4 a4(~x, x4)},
which could not have been detected by the gauge potentials (3.1) used in section 3. the
eective action term (4.1) holds, most likely, only for trivial holonomies h(~x) = 1 .) but
the partial result (3.13) suces for the main purpose of this paper. the appropriate cpt
transformation [1, 26] for an anti-hermitian gauge potential is, namely,

a(x)  at

 (x) ,

(4.2)

with the sux t indicating the transpose of the matrix. for a hermitian electromagnetic
vector potential a(x), this corresponds to the usual transformation a(x)  a(x).
using (4.2), one then readily veries that the yang-mills action density tr (aa) is
cpt-even and that the integrand of the eective action term (3.13), or (4.1) for that
matter, is cpt-odd.
(the overall factor i in (3.13), or (4.1), is absent for spacetime
metrics with lorentzian signature and need not be complex conjugated.) this establishes
the cpt anomaly for chiral gauge theories with left-handed fermions in an arbitrary
nonsinglet irreducible representation (provided the chiral gauge anomalies cancel in the
complete theory) and spacetime manifold m = ir3  s1.

the abelian chern-simons density has no cubic term and the integrand of the abelian
version of (4.1) is odd under both cpt and t (and even under both c and p), provided x4
corresponds to a spatial coordinate after the wick rotation from euclidean to lorentzian
metric signature. the t and cpt violation would, for example, show up in the anisotropic
propagation of the circular polarization modes of these abelian gauge elds (a given
circular polarization mode would, generically, have dierent phase velocity for propagation
in opposite directions [25]).

8

note, nally, that the terms (4.1) applied to the gauge groups su(3), su(2), and u(1),
with undetermined coecients replacing s0 (1 + a) /l, have also been considered in a
standard-model extension with lorentz and cpt violation [34]. as discussed above,
these su(3) and su(2) chern-simons-like terms are noninvariant under certain large
gauge transformations [7] and the u(1) chern-simons-like term may also become gauge
dependent if magnetic ux from monopoles is allowed for [22]. this suggests that either
the corresponding coecients must be zero or that additional nonlocal terms restoring
gauge invariance must be included in the theory. the anomaly calculation of the present
paper follows the second path, with nonlocal terms restoring gauge invariance.3

5 generalizations

the eective gauge eld action for certain chiral gauge theories dened over a xed four-
dimensional euclidean spacetime manifold m with cartesian product structure ir3  s1
has been found to contain a cpt-violating term if gauge invariance is maintained. for
the special gauge potentials (3.1), this cpt-violating term is given by (3.13), which can
be written as (4.1) for arbitrary localized gauge potentials with trivial holonomies. as
mentioned in the previous section, the overall factor i in (3.13) and (4.1) would be absent
for a lorentzian signature of the metric.

essentially the same result holds for other spacetime manifolds m, as long as at least one
compact spatial dimension can be factored out. the crucial point is that the weyl operator
should be separable with respect to this compact coordinate. also, the spin structure
over the compact spatial dimension must be such as to allow for zero momentum of the
fermions, cf. eq. (3.6). one example would be the at euclidean spacetime manifold m
= ir3 i, with the closed interval i  [0, l ]  ir replacing the circle s1 considered before.
here, the chiral fermions are taken to have free boundary conditions over i. (there would
be no cpt anomaly for antiperiodic boundary conditions. this would be the case for
nite-temperature eld theory in the euclidean path integral formulation [26, 36], which
uses the same manifold ir3  i with antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions
over the interval i  [0,  ], where  stands for the inverse temperature.) another example
would be the at minkowski-like manifold m = ir  s1  s1  s1, with time t  ir and a
compact space manifold, which would have three terms of the form (4.1) in the eective
gauge eld action. similar eects may occur in higher- and lower-dimensional chiral gauge
theories, but for the rest of this section we concentrate on the four-dimensional case, again
with the spacetime manifold m = ir3  s1.

3the same is to be expected for the eective gauge eld action from fermions with explicit cpt-
violating, but gauge-invariant, terms in the action [34]. for recent results on the induced abelian
chern-simons-like term from a massive dirac fermion with a cpt-violating axial-vector term in the
action, see ref.
[35] and references therein. chiral fermions with a real chemical potential  (and a
corresponding cpt-odd term in the action) also give rise to an induced chern-simons-like term, which
is now proportional to , see ref. [36] and the last equation therein.

9

the calculation of the cpt-violating term in section 3 was performed for a single
irreducible representation of left-handed weyl fermions. the particular theory considered,
with the gauge group g = so(10) and the fermion representation r l = 16, is free of
chiral gauge anomalies [12, 13, 16, 17]. it is, of course, possible to have more than one
nonsinglet irreducible fermion representation r for the left-handed fermions, provided the

chiral anomalies cancel. the reducible fermion representation is then r l = pf rf , with

the label f running over 1, . . . , nf . here, and in the following, the gauge group g is
taken to be either a simple compact lie group or an abelian u(1) group.

vectorlike gauge theories with, for example, one nonsinglet irreducible representation r
have r l = r + r and corresponding three-dimensional pauli-villars masses 0r and 0r,
where r denotes the conjugate representation of r. four-dimensional parity invariance
gives 0r = 0r . recalling (3.12), this implies that the cpt anomaly (4.1) cancels for
this particular vectorlike gauge theory. the same cancellation occurs, in fact, for any
vectorlike gauge theory.

chiral gauge theories with r l = pf rf (and r l 6= r l) may or may not have a

cpt-violating term (4.1) left over in the eective gauge eld action, depending on the
relative signs of the corresponding three-dimensional pauli-villars masses 0f . of course,
attention must be paid to the normalization of the dierent irreducible representations
rf . also, the situation can be complicated further by having more three-dimensional
pauli-villars elds than the ones used in section 3. the factor s0 =  1 in (3.10), (3.13),
and (4.1), is then replaced by (2 k0f + 1), for k0f  zz. the same odd integer prefactors
of the induced chern-simons density also appear for other three-dimensional ultraviolet
regularization methods and are, in fact, to be expected on general grounds [23].

for a chiral gauge theory with an odd number nf of equal

irreducible left-handed
fermion representations, there necessarily appears a cpt-violating term proportional to
(4.1) in the eective gauge eld action. the reason is that the sum of an odd number of odd

numbers does not vanish, pf (2 k0f + 1) 6= 0 for f summed over 1 to nf . an example for

nf = 3 would be the so(10) chiral gauge theory with the reducible fermion representation
r l = 16 + 16 + 16, which necessarily has a cpt-violating term proportional to (4.1)
for the so(10) gauge elds in the eective action.

this particular so(10) model contains, as is well known, the su(3)  su(2)  u(1)
standard model [26, 28] with nf = 3 families of 15 left-handed weyl fermions, together
with nf = 3 left-handed weyl fermion singlets (conjugates of the hypothetical right-
handed neutrinos). the standard model has thus a cpt-violating term proportional to
(4.1) for the hypercharge u(1) gauge elds in the eective action, together with similar
terms for the weak su(2) and color su(3) gauge elds, as long as the spacetime manifold
has the appropriate cartesian product structure and the standard model is embedded in
this particular so(10) chiral gauge theory.4 other simple compact lie groups instead of

4it is not clear to what extent the 33 remaining gauge bosons from so(10) need to be physical, but

they could always be given large masses by the higgs mechanism [27, 28].

so(10) may also be used for the embedding of the standard model fermions, as long as
they have an odd number of equal irreducible representations. this embedding condition
for the standard model fermions guarantees the presence of the cpt-violating chern-
simons-like terms for the su(3)  su(2)  u(1) gauge elds in the eective action,
otherwise these terms may or may not appear, depending on the regularization scheme.

6 discussion

in the previous sections, we have established for certain chiral gauge theories dened over
the spacetime manifold m = ir3  s1 the necessary presence of a cpt-violating term in
the gauge-invariant eective action. the question, now, is what happened to the cpt
theorem? it appears that the cpt theorem is circumvented by a breakdown of local
lorentz invariance at the quantum level.
(see also the paragraph above (3.9), which
discusses the breaking of lorentz invariance by the ultraviolet regularization used.) more
specically, the second-quantized vacuum seems to play a role in connecting the global
spacetime structure to the local physics. the next two paragraphs elaborate this point
but may be skipped in a rst reading.

for non-abelian chiral gauge groups, there is the condition of gauge invariance to deal
with in these particular quantum eld theories which are potentially aicted by the non-
perturbative chiral gauge anomaly discovered earlier [16]. this nonperturbative chiral
gauge anomaly depends on the global spacetime structure in a lorentz noninvariant way,
one spatial direction being singled out by the so-called z-string conguration responsible
for the gauge anomaly in the hamiltonian formulation.
if the theory has indeed this
z-string chiral gauge anomaly, then the restoration of gauge invariance obviously requires
interactions which are themselves lorentz noninvariant [7]. but, even if the theory does
not have a net z-string chiral gauge anomaly, there still occurs, in rst-quantization, the
spectral ow which treats one spatial dimension dierently from the others [16]. this im-
plies that a tentative second-quantized vacuum state varies along the corresponding loop
of gauge transformations. imposing gauge invariance throughout then leads to lorentz
noninvariance of the theory. in both cases, the invariance under the proper orthochronous
lorentz group is lost and the cpt theorem no longer applies [1]. it is then possible to
have a non-abelian cpt-odd term (4.1) in the eective gauge eld action.

for abelian chiral gauge groups, nonzero magnetic ux from monopoles can also give
rise to spectral ow, as discussed for the three-dimensional case in ref.
[22]. for the
four-dimensional case, this setup again breaks lorentz invariance (just as the z-string
does for the non-abelian chiral gauge anomaly) and the cpt theorem no longer applies,
with the possibility of having an abelian cpt-odd term (4.1) in the eective gauge eld
action.

for both abelian and non-abelian chiral gauge groups, it remains to be seen whether
in particular, the

or not the gauge-invariant, but cpt-violating, theory is consistent.

properties of microcausality and positivity of the energy need to be established, cf. refs.
[2, 3, 34]. if the theory in question turns out to be inconsistent, then perhaps it could
be interpreted as part of a more fundamental theory, possibly involving curvature and
torsion.

in this paper, we have primarily been concerned with the mechanism of the cpt
anomaly, not potential applications. let us, however, mention two possibilities. first,
there may be the optical activity [25] discussed in the introduction, where the linear
polarization of a plane wave of gauge elds gets rotated in vacuo (in our case, through
the quantum eects of the chiral fermions encoded in the eective gauge eld action). as
mentioned in section 5, the phenomenon could occur for the photon eld of the standard
model, as long as there is the so(10)-like embedding of the standard model fermions and
the appropriate cartesian product structure of the spacetime manifold. the laboratory
measurement of this optical activity of the vacuum could, in principle, provide information
about the global structure and size of the universe. more realistically, the mass scale of
the cpt-violating term (4.1) for the photon eld is of the order of

 l1  1035 ev   

1/137!   1.5 1010 lyr

l

! ,

(6.1)

with   e2/4  the ne-structure constant and l the range of the compact spatial
coordinate. this mass is, of course, very small on the scale of the known elementary
particles (the present universe being very large), but, remarkably, it is only a factor 100
below the current upper bound of  1033 ev obtained from observations on distant radio
galaxies, see refs.
(the laboratory has now been
expanded to a signicant part of the visible universe.) a dedicated observation program
to map the linear polarization in a large number of distant radio sources [37], or future
satellite experiments to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background
[38], can perhaps reach the sensitivity level set by (6.1).

[25, 37] and references therein.

second, the cpt anomaly may have been important in the very early universe. in the
present paper, we have considered a xed spacetime manifold with given topology. with
gravity, spacetime becomes dynamic. for an inverse size 1/l(t) and typical scattering
energies of the order of the gravitational scale (planck mass), the cpt-violating eects
of the eective action term (4.1) are relatively unsuppressed compared to gravity, that is
suppressed by the square of the gauge coupling constant only. of course, the fundamental
theory of gravity remains to be determined if there is indeed lorentz noninvariance in
certain inertial frames. still, it is conceivable that the cpt anomaly plays a role in den-
ing a fundamental arrow-of-time [4, 39], as a quantum mechanical eect coming from
the interplay of chiral fermions, gauge eld interactions and the topology of spacetime.
