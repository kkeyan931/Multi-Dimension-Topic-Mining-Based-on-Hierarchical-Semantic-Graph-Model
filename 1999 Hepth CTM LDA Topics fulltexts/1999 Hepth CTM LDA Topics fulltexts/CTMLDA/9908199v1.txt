introduction

understanding the restrictions imposed by duality in quantum eld theory and string

theory is an important goal. one motivation for studying duality is to understand the

degrees of freedom in terms of which a certain theory should be formulated. another

related motivation is, given the right degrees of freedom, to describe the dynamics of the

theory in the dierent regimes.

just understanding the appropriate degrees of freedom and formulation in terms of

which quantum eld theory and string theory should be described  at least at strong

coupling  has been a recurring theme. the question what is quantum eld theory? has

basically only been answered in terms of perturbation theory and certain non-perturbative

methods, such as lattice models. to give a more complete answer we need to understand

what happens at strong coupling. this is where duality comes in.

in general terms,

duality means an equivalence between two or more descriptions of a physical system (or

model). the duality typically connects descriptions in terms of dierent elds, but this

mapping is not in any way guaranteed to be simple: for example one description could

be in terms of a gauge theory in d dimensions while the other (dual) description could

be in terms of a string theory in d + 1 dimensions. an example is the ads/cf t duality

of maldacena [1].

how can duality now be used? typically, duality exchanges weak coupling with strong
coupling through   d = 1/, where  is a coupling constant so that, in principle, a
computation at strong coupling (where  is large) can be worked out by looking at the

4

dual weakly coupled formulation of the theory (where d is small). this kind of duality

is called s-duality. the moduli space of the theory has accordingly at least two cusps

with  being small near one of them and d small near the other. so duality relates the

physics at these two cusps despite the fact that the perturbative description of the theory

in terms of actions, elds and symmetries is generally dierent at the various cusps (see

g. 4.2 in chapter 4 for an illustration  with six cusps  in the context of string theory).

it would of course be very nice if we could for example understand qcd both in the

asymptotically free and the conning regime  and also prove connement! however,

such a hope has not as yet been realized. at least in four and higher dimensions, it has

hereunto seemed that supersymmetry is necessary in order to have any duality relations

and that only such supersymmetric versions of qcd could be understood at strong

coupling (the recent work of maldacena [1] seems to be an exception). one of the most
important works in this direction is the solution of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory by seiberg and witten [2, 3] from 1994. it turns out that the relevant degrees of

freedom at strong coupling are not the basic elds in the theory but rather monopoles
and dyons. also certain theories with n = 1 supersymmetry have been shown by seiberg
[4] and others to exhibit a form of duality.

it is remarkable that the use of duality is not conned to physics. in a major break-
through, witten [5] has demonstrated how the above-mentioned n = 2 duality can be
applied to the study of four-dimensional manifolds and their (smooth) invariants: instead

of computing the so-called donaldson invariants from su(2) instanton solutions, witten

has shown that one can obtain the same invariants from the solutions of the dual equa-

tions which include abelian gauge elds and monopoles and are therefore much simpler

to analyze. these results have made a profound impact on the mathematics community.

the similar question for string theory what is string theory? seems much more dif-

cult to answer. before 1994 string theory was understood only as a theory of interacting

one-dimensional objects. it has turned out that there is not just one perturbative string

theory but rather ve of them which can be consistently formulated at weak coupling
(they are the type iia and type iib theories which have n = 2 supersymmetry, and
the three theories with n = 1 supersymmetry: the heterotic so(32), heterotic e8  e8
theory and a type i theory). with the help of duality it has been conjectured that these

5

ve superstring theories are non-perturbatively equivalent. as an example the strong

coupling limit of type i open string theory can be described as a weakly coupled closed

so(32) heterotic string theory. a tool central to this understanding has been the inter-

pretation of certain string solitons as the source of a r-r eld [6]: these are the so-called

d-branes which are p-dimensional extended objects (with p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 in the type iia

string theory for example) with tension that varies as 1/. so, string theory does not

appear to be a theory of strings only.

there is another surprise:

in the picture supported by duality all ve of these con-

sistent string theories seem to represent a perturbative expansion at dierent points in

moduli space of a single underlying theory. however, not all points in moduli space

represent ten-dimensional theories. in fact, there are points corresponding to an eleven-

dimensional vacuum, since the strong coupling limit of ten-dimensional type iia string

theory is an eleven-dimensional theory [7]. this eleven-dimensional theory is tentatively

called m-theory; its low energy limit is eleven-dimensional supergravity.

the use of duality in string/m-theory today is largely aimed at answering the ques-

tion: what is m-theory?. however, as there are still many unanswered questions as

to what string theory really is about, this is of course a very early stage for trying to

answer such a question. one proposal is the matrix theory conjecture by banks et al.

[8]: m-theory in the innite momentum frame is described by a u(n) yang-mills theory
in 1 + 0 dimensions (with n  ). the fundamental degrees of freedom can be inter-
preted as the d0-branes of the type iia string theory. another recent proposal is the

anti-de sitter/conformal eld theory correspondence of maldacena [1]. this conjecture

states that m-theory compactied on adsd+1 (d + 1-dimensional anti-de sitter space) is

dual to a conformal eld theory living on the d-dimensional boundary of adsd+1. this

correspondence satises an interesting holography principle: the bulk degrees of freedom

can be identied with the degrees of freedom living on the boundary of spacetime with

(at most) one degree of freedom per planck area [9].

there are many examples of dualities in the literature. some have been known for

a long time - e.g. in quantum eld theory - whereas some have only very recently been

discovered - e.g. in string theory. to make the discussion a little more concrete, we shall

list some basic examples (which reveal properties that will reappear a number of times

6

in this thesis).

 a simple duality (and one which was already noted by dirac [10]) is that of electric-
magnetic duality. to describe it, begin with the source-free maxwell equations. the

equations of motion for the eld strength are

and the bianchi identities are

f  = 0

  f  = 0 ,

(1.1)

(1.2)

where f  = 1
under

2f is the dual eld strength. these equations are invariant

f   f  , f   f  ,

(1.3)

which interchange the equations of motion with the bianchi identities. concretely,
the equations of motion follow from the standard action 1

4 r d4xff , while the
bianchi identity is just the divergence condition that follows from the fact that
f = a  a. in terms of electric and magnetic elds we have ei = f0i and
bi = 1

2 ijkfjk, so this symmetry (1.3) is the same as the discrete symmetry:

e  b , b  e .

(1.4)

to extend this duality to the maxwell equations with sources, we have to add both

electric and magnetic sources in which case

and the bianchi identities are

f  = j
e

  f  = j
m .

(1.5)

(1.6)

as shown by dirac [10], a quantum theory of both electric and magnetic charges is

only consistent if the dirac quantization condition is satised. it is interesting to

see how this condition can be derived. if we have a monopole, of charge qm, at the

origin and surround it with a two-sphere, then

f = qm .

zs2

7

(1.7)

globally we cannot have f = da, since if this were true the ux would vanish

by stokes theorem. but we can write f = da except along a dirac string. an

electric charge qe will, when moving along a closed path p , acquire a phase in its

wavefunction

exp(cid:18)iqezp

a(cid:19) = exp(cid:18)iqezs

f(cid:19) ,

(1.8)

provided s does not intersect the dirac string (s is a surface that has p as its

boundary). when the path p is contracted to a vanishing circle but which still

circumnavigates the dirac string, the phase must be

exp(cid:18)iqezs2

f(cid:19) = exp (iqeqm)

(1.9)

and equal to 1 since the dirac string should be non-physical. therefore, we have

the dirac quantization condition:

qeqm = 2n ,

(1.10)

where n is integer (it is fascinating that this result not only applies to point parti-

cles; in ten-dimensional string theory, this result readily generalizes to the above-

mentioned d-branes). such a duality oers an explanation for why electric charge

is observed to be quantized.

 the two-dimensional sine-gordon model is dual to the massive thirring model [11].

the relation between the coupling constants in the two theories is

2
4

=

1

1 + g/

,

(1.11)

so that weak coupling in the sine-gordon model ( small) corresponds to strong

coupling (g large) in the massive thirring model  and vice versa. this is also an

example where a fundamental object is dual to a solitonic object since the soliton

of the sine-gordon model can be interpreted as the fundamental fermion eld of

the thirring model. more concretely, the fermion eld  can be written as the

following vertex operator of the boson eld  [12]:

(x) =: e2i1r x



dz (z)+ 1

2 i(x) : ,

(1.12)

(here  is the derivative of  with respect to time and :: means normal ordering).

note that this is an exact and derived duality.

8

 the ising model (on a square lattice) exhibits a so-called kramerswannier duality
[13]. in this model the partition function z(k) is a function of the temperature t

and the strength j of the nearest neighbour interaction. we introduce the quantity

k = j/(kbt ) for convenience. the partition function can be calculated exactly

(onsagers solution) and is equal to the partition function of the dual lattice theory

z  if the coupling constants are related according to

sinh 2k =

1

sinh 2k  .

(1.13)

thus, weak coupling (k  0) in one theory is dual to strong coupling (k   )
in the dual theory.

 four-dimensional n = 4 non-abelian supersymmetric yang-mills theory is conjec-
tured to exhibit a montonen-olive duality [14]. with gauge group u(n) this theory

is in fact self-dual, so the dual theory at the other expansion point is identical to

the old one (meaning, among other things, that the actions are equal). the bosonic
part of the lagrangian of the n = 4 theory contains a yang-mills term proportional
to 1/g2, and a -term. on the complex coupling constant

the conjectured sl(2, z)-duality acts as

 =


2

+

4i
g2

,

 

a + b
c + d

.

(1.14)

(1.15)

here a, b, c, d  z and ad  bc = 1. the transformation   1/ , for  = 0, is
seen to be a strong-weak coupling duality.

what we learn from these examples is that the moduli space can conveniently be

thought of as a manifold covered by an atlas of dierent perturbative expansions (or

patches). thus, a given description - in terms of elds, action etc. - generally depends

on the particular patch. in this picture the transition functions correspond to the duality

transformations. when we ask a question like what is string theory?, we are really

asking what is the correct description of this moduli space? can it only be described in

terms of dierent patches or perturbative regions connected by duality transformations,

or is there a more fundamental description of the theory?

9

let us add a comment about the validity of duality. in nearly all cases studied so

far, duality has the status of a conjecture. to really prove duality, say s-duality, we

need to understand non-perturbative eects. establishing that a pair of theories are

really dual can only be done by solving them exactly, or by nding a eld redenition

that brings one theory into the other. examples where this can be done are the sine-

gordon/thirring model pair of theories and the ising model. duality therefore typically

enters in as a working hypothesis: if we have strong evidence leading us to believe that

two theories actually are dual, then by studying the strong coupling regime of one theory

in terms of the other weakly coupled theory, we are likely to learn something new and

often interesting.

we might also add that in some cases it is only certain limits of the dual theories

that are known or can even be described in terms of a perturbative theory. the type

iia string theory is for example well understood in the limit of small string coupling and

it is conjectured to be described in terms of an eleven-dimensional theory in the limit of

very large coupling. however, what happens in between we do not really know.

the thesis is organized as follows. in the second and third chapter original results of

the author (and collaborators) are used to gain insight into the use of duality in some

familiar theories.

in chapter 2 we study seiberg-witten duality of topological eld theories. after

reviewing the key facts about topological eld theory we describe the donaldson and

seiberg-witten theories as (dual) approaches to the study of four-manifolds. the last

section of this chapter is based on [19] and the dimensionally reduced versions of these

theories are derived.

in chapter 3 we consider in detail the t -duality of two-dimensional sigma models away

from the conformal point. this chapter is primarily based on [72], [74] and [75]. it is

conjectured that the relation [t, r] = 0 should hold true between the rg ow (generated

by r) and t -duality of such models. this has been demonstrated to be satised at

one-loop in bosonic and heterotic sigma models and also at two-loop for models with
n = 0, 1, 2 supersymmetry with a purely metric background. demanding, on the other
hand, a priori that [t, r] = 0, one can essentially determine the exact (at least to the

orders in  considered) rg ow of the various models. this has also been shown to

10

apply to models that are s-dual [78].

chapter 4 is a short review of duality in ten-dimensional string theory. we review the

manner in which all ve consistent string theories can (at least in principle) be related.

for consistency such dualities in string theory should imply a number of dualities in eld

theory. as an example, the montonen-olive duality can be understood as coming from

a duality in type ii string theory compactied to four dimensions.

finally, chapter 5 contains our discussion.

appendix a describes the kaluza-klein reduction of certain tensors which are neces-

sary for the computations in chapter 3; appendix b contains a list of tensors which are

important for the computation of a two-loop beta function in chapter 3.

duality in topological field theories

while it may be impossible to prove any of the nontrivial duality relations in quantum

eld theory and string theory directly, one can infer evidence for certain dualities by

examining the consequences in some simple models.

there exist quantum eld theories which are of a very simple kind and apparently

of limited applicability in physics, namely the topological quantum eld theories [15].

from a physical point of view, one might simply categorize these theories as trivial since

they describe a situation in which there are no propagating degrees of freedom the only

observables being (global) topological invariants.

but physically it is still useful to study topological eld theories. for example, a key

to studying, say, s-duality is to examine quantities/states in the full theories which are

such that some of their properties can be reliably calculated at both strong and weak

coupling. the bps states comprise one such set of examples (because of supersymme-

try non-renormalization theorems). it turns out that frequently bps states of the full

original theory make up the complete physical spectrum of a simplied theory, namely

a topological twist of the original theory. it is in this connection that topological eld

theories allow one to explore consequences of duality.

also, from a mathematical standpoint, these theories are in no way trivial as they

lead to important results (for example in relation to donaldson theory of four-manifolds

[16]). hence, topological eld theories can be expected to oer an excellent testing ground

for certain dualities since the results can in principle be checked independently of any

12

eld theory formulation (an important example is the test of montonen-olive duality
in n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory by vafa and witten [17]). moreover, if we
believe that the duality conjectures are correct, new and important results in mathematics

may emerge.

in this chapter we will consider the topological eld theories which can be obtained
from the n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four dimensions by a simple twist-
ing procedure. the n = 2 theory has two dual descriptions: one (relevant at weak
coupling) in which the fundamental degrees of freedom are the gauge particles of su(2)

and another (which is relevant at strong coupling) in which the fundamental degrees of

freedom are monopoles and dyons of a u(1) theory. twisting these two quantum eld

theories, one obtains a dual pair of topological eld theories relevant for the description of

donaldson theory where the weak coupling description opens the possibility of a pertur-

bative approach to this theory, while the strong coupling description reveals interesting

non-perturbative properties.

to set the scene, we start by giving a short review of topological eld theory (an

excellent review of topological eld theory can be found in [18]). in the following section
we show how donaldson theory appears after a twisting of the n = 2 theory at weak
coupling and describe the observables which can be viewed as topological invariants of

smooth four-manifolds. we then present the dual formulation, the seiberg-witten theory,

and its salient points. finally, we consider a version of this seiberg-witten duality in

three and two dimensions [19]. the dimensionally reduced actions are derived and some

results that could be relevant for studying the so-called hitchin equations on riemann

surfaces [20] are presented.

2.1 topological field theory

the study of topological quantum eld theory started in 1988 with the work of witten

[15] who constructed a simple quantum eld theory that is now known as donaldson-
witten theory. witten observed that a twisted version of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-
mills theory in four dimensions has no local degrees of freedom, but only global degrees

of freedom; these are the topological invariants. this theory provided the physical in-

13

terpretation (that was speculated to exist by atiyah) of donaldson theory which is a

mathematical theory that through the study of the instanton solutions of yang-mills

theory had provided an important advance in the topology of four-manifolds.

later that year witten formulated two other topological eld theories, namely the

topological sigma model in two dimensions [21] and the chern-simons theory in three

dimensions [22]. all these theories are related to dierent invariants which have been

studied in the mathematics literature. the donaldson-witten theory can be related to

donaldson invariants (which we will dene later) of four-manifolds and, in its three-

dimensional version, to the so-called casson invariants [18]. the witten approach to

chern-simons theory on the other hand can be related to the jones polynomial. this is a

polynomial invariant of knots and links in three dimensions [22]. finally, the topological

sigma models can be related to the so-called gromov-witten invariants and quantum

cohomology [18].

one can rather naturally distinguish two types of topological quantum eld theories:

the witten type (or cohomological type) and the schwarz type [22] (or quantum type).

in the following we will mainly concentrate on the witten type.

to dene what a topological eld theory is, we start with the following objects. let

x be a riemann manifold with metric g and let  denote any set of elds on x with
an action s(). operators which are functionals of these elds are denoted by o() and
a vacuum expectation value of a product of elds is formally dened by the functional

integral

hoo   oi = z d[]o()o()  o()es() ,

(2.1)

where d[] denotes the path integral measure. a quantum eld theory on x is topo-

logical if there is a set of operators which are invariant under arbitrary deformations

of the metric g, in the sense that,

ghoo   oi = 0 ,

(2.2)

i.e. the expectation values of products of observables are topological invariants.

our interest here will be focused on the so-called smooth invariants, that is quantities
which are invariant under dieomorphisms (a dieomorphism f of x is a map f : x  x 
for which both f and f 1 are c ) of the base manifold x; phrased dierently, that

14

they are constant on a dieomorphism equivalence class of manifolds. the correlation

functions in (2.2) are of this kind as are the donaldson invariants which we will discuss

later. 1

now we are in a position to dene what a schwarz and a witten type topological eld

theory is.

a witten type theory is topological since these theories have an energy-momentum

tensor which is brst exact:

t = {q, v(, g)} ,

(2.3)

where v is a symmetric functional (with ghostnumber equal to -1) of the elds and the
metric. q is the nilpotent brst-like operator (q2 = 0) corresponding to some symmetry

 of the theory that keeps the action invariant (usually,  is a combination of a so-called

shift symmetry  =  and a gauge symmetry). henceforth q is simply called the brst

operator, and the energy-momentum tensor is t = s/g. the notation used is such

that the brst variation  of any eld  is

 = i{q, } ,

(2.4)

expressing that q is the generator of the symmetry . for  bosonic the expression in

(2.4) is a commutator and for  fermionic it means an anti-commutator. the topological
nature of the theory then follows from the fact that any brst closed operator o
({q,o} = 0) satisfying go = {q, r} has vanishing variation under the path integral:

ghoi = z d[] (go  gs  o) es()
= z d[] ({q, r}  {q, v }o)
= h{q, r  v  o}i = 0 .

(2.5)

in deriving this, we have assumed that the measure d[] is invariant under the sym-
metry and that the vacuum is brst invariant (for this implies h{q, x}i = 0 for any
1in mathematical terms a topological invariant is a quantity which is invariant under homeomorphisms
of the base manifold x (a homeomorphism is a map f : x  x  for which both f and f 1 are
continuous), or phrased dierently, it is constant on a homeomorphism class of manifolds. so a smooth

invariant is not necessarily a topological invariant.

15

functional x). also, we shall generally be assuming that the brst operator q is metric

independent.

what are then the natural observables in the witten type theory? in such a theory,
any brst closed operator satisfying go = {q, r} will be an observable because
of (2.5). furthermore, adding a brst exact term to an observable will not change its

expectation value, and the observables can therefore be identied with cohomology classes

of the brst operator, much like in string theory [23]. it is simple to generalize to any
correlator hoo   oi and show that it is independent of arbitrary deformations of
the metric. such a correlator is then a topological invariant, though it might actually be

trivial in most cases.

note that a way to ensure that the energy-momentum tensor is brst exact, is to

require brst exactness of the quantum action itself

sq() = {q, (, g)} .

(2.6)

this will often be assumed in the following (on the right hand side of (2.6) one can always

add a metric independent term without destroying the topological nature of the theory.

however, if one does not want that term to inuence the moduli space probed by the

theory, then it should be not only metric independent but also topological - in the sense

that it is locally a total derivative).

a schwarz type theory is topological since in such a theory the classical action sc()
and the operators o are independent of the metric. the quantum action - including
ghosts for gauge xing - is then of the form sq = sc + {qb, v }, where qb is now the
standard eld theory brst operator. at least formally, one can then conclude that (2.3)

holds and therefore also (2.2) as in the witten type case. celebrated examples are the

chern-simons gauge theories [22] and the bf theories [18].

we now turn to witten type theories.

the most basic invariant is simply the partition function: as the identity operator is

always an observable we can conclude from eq. (2.5) that the partition function of the

theory is invariant under deformations of the metric

gh1i = gz = 0 ,

16

(2.7)

which implies that z is a topological invariant. moreover, and very importantly, the

partition function is independent also of the coupling constant. to show this, we assume

that the coupling constant  appears in the action as s/2. the variation of z with

respect to 2 is:

z = z d[]es /2

= (
= (
= (

1

1

2 )z d[]es /2
2 )z d[]es /2
1
2 )  h{q, }i  2 = 0 .

 s
 {q, }  2

(2.8)

this means that, at least formally, we can evaluate z in the weak coupling limit (  0)
 or the strong coupling limit (  ) for that matter  meaning that the semi-classical
approximation is exact. assuming that the observables do not depend on the coupling

constant, the same is of course true for any correlation function.

that topological eld theories are simple and almost trivial from a physical viewpoint

can be illustrated by the following considerations: in a witten-type theory any bosonic

eld will have a brst (or q-) superpartner, or schematically

{q, eld} = ghost ,

(2.9)

which, since physical states should be annihilated by q, must be interpreted as ghosts.

thus, the total number of degrees of freedom is zero and the physical phase space is

zero-dimensional. secondly, in such a theory the energy of any physical state is zero:

hhi = hz t00i = hz {q, v00}i = 0 ,

(2.10)

and a topological eld theory therefore has no dynamical excitations!

the way we introduced topological eld theories above was rather ad hoc. while

topological eld theories might seem to be rather trivial from a physical viewpoint, they

are certainly not trivial from a mathematical viewpoint. witten type theories for example

are related to the study of dierent moduli spaces which play an important role in topol-

ogy. a typical (but certainly not any) moduli problem can be formulated in quantum

eld theoretic terms by using the paradigm of elds, equations and symmetries [24]. as

an example, donaldson theory  which we will describe later  can be viewed as the study

17

of the moduli space of yang-mills instantons. the elds here are the gauge potentials
aa
(x) and the equations are the self-duality equations f = f, where f is the eld
strength f = aa+[a, a] and f is the hodge dual f = 1
2f . the
 = da. finally, the moduli
symmetries are of course just the gauge symmetries aa
space can be described as the space of instanton solutions modulo the gauge symmetries.
this moduli space mk is characterized by the instanton number k, which is minus the
second chern number:

k = c2(f ) =

1

82 zx

tr(f  f ) .

(2.11)

before jumping to the elusive four-dimensional world, we would like to describe a

topological eld theory that appears naturally in two dimensions - namely the topological
sigma model. in this case the elds can be identied with maps  :   k, where 
is a two-dimensional surface and k is a kahler manifold, which has even real dimension.
the equations state that i is a holomorphic map, concretely zi = 0, with (z, z)

being coordinates on  and i = 1, 2, . . . , dimk/2. however, there are no symmetries.

the action of a topological sigma model with kahler target space is [21]:

s = 2z

 ri ij j(cid:21) ,
i i j

+ d j gi j

(2.12)

where gi j = g ji is the kahler metric and ri ij j is the riemann tensor; d is the covariant

derivative pulled back from k to :

di = i + ki

kll .

(2.13)

here i

kl is the christoel connection. the action has a symmetry generated by left-

moving and right-moving charges:

i =  i = 0, i = ii ,  i = i i ,
+ = 2+i  igi ssgk ss k
 i
+ ,
 = 2 i  igs i sgs k s k
 i
 ,

(2.14)

with  and  being two independent and anticommuting parameters. for  =  there is

a single standard brst operator q with q2 = 0. the ghost numbers of the elds , 

18

and  are u = 0,1 and 1 respectively. this theory can be constructed by twisting the
n = 2 supersymmetric sigma model [21]. however in two dimensions the twisting is not
unique. for k a calabi-yau manifold there are two possible twistings that give rise to

the so-called a- and b-models and they are related by mirror symmetry of the target

manifold [25]. the model described above (and for k a calabi-yau manifold) is in these

terms called the a-model.

the observables in topological sigma models are constructed as follows [21]. if a(p) =
ai1ipdi1      dip is a p-form on k then one constructs the operator (we are now
using real coordinates on k):

that obeys

o(0)
a = ai1ipi1    ip ,

{q,o(0)

a } = o(0)
da ,

(2.15)

(2.16)

with d the exterior derivative on k and  = i{q,}; o(0)
a can be viewed as a zero-form
on . thus, according to (2.16) brst cohomology classes of operators are in one-to-one
correspondence with the de rham cohomology classes of k: {q,oa} = 0 if and only if
a is closed and oa = {q,ob} if and only if a = db, that is a is exact. choosing a
to be closed, one then recursively solves the two equations

do(0)

a = i{q,o(1)

a }, do(1)

a = i{q,o(2)

a } .

(2.17)

here we nd

o(1)
a = ipai1ipi1i2    ipd, o(2)

a = 

1
2

p(p1)ai1ipi1i2i3    ipdd ,
(2.18)

and they can be seen as respectively a one- and a two-form on  with local coordinates

. thus we have three classes of observables on . the rst class consists of operators

of the form

o(0)
a (p ) ,

where p is a point in . the second class consists of operators like

zc o(1)

a ,

19

(2.19)

(2.20)

with c a one-cycle in ; because of (2.17) this operator only depends on the homology

class of c. finally the third class are operators of the form:

z o(2)

a .

(2.21)

the rst of these operators is brst closed because of (2.16). the two other operators

(2.20) and (2.21) are brst closed because of (2.17). the correlation functions consisting

of products of operators like (2.19), (2.20) and (2.21) gives topological invariants as in

(2.2) - more precisely the so-called gromov-witten invariants [18].

2.2 donaldson-witten theory

what has now become known as donaldson-witten theory originated as a topological

eld theory constructed by witten in 1988 [15]. motivated by work of atiyah and floer,
witten showed that a certain twisting of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory
yields a topological eld theory, which is precisely such that the vacuum expectation

values of certain observables are donaldson invariants of four-manifolds. such invariants

were introduced by donaldson in 1983 [16] as an important tool in the classication of

four-dimensional (dierentiable) manifolds.

as such, an important motivation for studying donaldson-witten theory is its relation

to the classication problem of four-dimensional (dierentiable) manifolds. here, the

goal is to classify all dierentiable manifolds up to dieomorphisms, the more general

classication problem being to classify all topological manifolds up to homeomorphisms.

it is well known that the classication problem is rather trivial in two dimensions.

any compact, orientable surface, i.e. a riemann surface, is homeomorphic to a sphere

with g handles, and two such surfaces are homeomorphic exactly if they have the same

number of handles. topologically, riemann surfaces are therefore classied by a single

integer, the genus, see g. 2.1.

in higher dimensions there is unfortunately no such simple classication (there is a
partial classication for d  5, see e.g. [18]). especially in four dimensions the situation
is much more complicated  and this is the dimension relevant for donaldson theory.

that there can be no corresponding list of four-manifolds can be demonstrated by

20

  g=0                    g=1                                       g=2                                        

figure 2.1: the genus expansion of riemann surfaces.

looking at a very basic invariant of any manifold, namely the fundamental group 1 (this
is the equivalence class of based loops in x  for example 1(s1) = z). now, there is a

theorem in topology which states that any nitely representable group (this is a group

generated by nitely many elements that satisfy a nite number of relations) can appear

as the fundamental group of a four-dimensional manifold [18, 26]. moreover, there is no

algorithm to decide whether two such nitely representable groups are isomorphic  and

therefore a classication similar to the one in two dimensions must necessarily fail.

a natural assumption in donaldson theory is therefore that the four-manifold x is

simply connected, that is the fundamental group vanishes: 1(x) = 0. hence, there can

only be nontrivial k-dimensional homology cycles for k = 0, 2, 4 (if 1(x) is commutative

then it is isomorphic to h1(x) [27]; in particular if 1(x) = 0 then also h1(x) = 0 and

by poincare duality h3(x) = 0).

this being the case, it is natural to consider another important invariant the second
cohomology group h 2(x). for ,   h 2(x) we can dene the so-called intersection
form that plays an important role in donaldsons work,

q(, ) = zx

   ,

(2.22)

which is symmetric and non-degenerate (i.e. q(, ) = q(, ) and q(, ) = 0 for all 

implies  = 0). this form can therefore be diagonalized over r. the intersection form q

is called even if all its diagonal elements are even and otherwise called odd. the impor-

tance of this invariant can be appreciated by quoting a theorem of freedman: a simply

connected four-manifold x with even intersection form q belongs to a unique homeo-

morphism class, and if q is odd there are precisely two non-homeomorphic x with q as

21

their intersection form [28]. this of course means that the intersection form essentially

determines the homeomorphism class of a simply connected manifold x, and explains

why the intersection form is important for the study of topological four-manifolds.

donaldson theory, on the other hand, concerns mainly two things: (1) the study of

topological obstructions to the existence of a dierentiable structure on a given topological

four-manifold and (2) the distinction between dierentiable structures on a given four-

manifold. phrased dierently we can, given a topological four-manifold x, ask: (1) does

there exist one or more dierentiable structures on x? and (2) if there is a dierentiable

structure, is it unique? one important theorem which was subsequently derived by

donaldson using the theory of yang-mills instantons can now be stated: a compact

smooth simply connected four-manifold, with positive denite intersection form q has

the property that q is always diagonalizable over the integers to q = diag(1, . . . , 1) [16].

this implies for example that no simply connected four-manifold for which q is even

and positive denite has a smooth structure. the donaldson invariants, which we will

discuss later, are important because they can distinguish between manifolds that have the

same intersection form. so in mathematical terms they are not topological invariants but

rather smooth invariants: they can distinguish homeomorphic non-dieomorphic smooth

manifolds.

after this mathematical interlude, we will turn to the eld theory description of

donaldson theory  and in order to make the discussion more concrete we will start by

presenting the action of donaldson-witten theory and its symmetries.

we start with a four-manifold x over which we have a non-abelian connection a

transforming in the adjoint representation of su(2). the donaldson-witten theory in

four dimensions is then described by the following topological action [15] (with ,  =

1, . . . , 4):

s(4) = zx

(2.23)

we are here using the same notation as in [19]  the term  [, ] present in wittens

action [15] can be included by adding to eq. (2.23) a -exact term [29]. this action can

22

be obtained as the brst variation of

v (4) = trf +

  tr

(2.24)

and the theory is therefore topological according to the discussion in the previous section.
f is the eld strength, f = a  a + [a, a] and f +
f, that is f +
 =  and  = 1
the action. the elds transform as

 is the selfdual part of
2 f ;  is a self-dual two-form (that is

b = 0 ,

 = 2i ,

2[, ] .

(2.25)

the corresponding ghost numbers of the elds (a, , , , , ) are u = (0, 2,2,1, 1,1).
while it might not be obvious that this action is related to the moduli space of instantons,

this can be argued as follows [15]. the gauge eld terms in the action are

d4xgtr[ff  + f f ] =

1

4 zx

1

8 zx

d4xgtr(f + f)(f  + f ) ,

(2.26)

and vanishes only if f =  f, which are exactly the instanton solutions. these
classical minima dominate since, as mentioned previously, the partition function can be

evaluated at weak coupling.

twisting of n = 2
we will now describe how this theory can be constructed as a twisting of standard
n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with gauge group su(2) (see [15, 30] for
further details).

start with the usual n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory on at r4. four-
dimensional euclidean space has a symmetry (or rotation) group which is k = spin(4) =
su(2)l su(2)r. the internal symmetry group of the n = 2 theory is su(2)i  u(1)r,
where the rst group is the isospin group and the last group corresponds to the r-
symmetry of the n = 2 lagrangian (that transforms the gluino eld as   ei

23

and    ei   for example). on r4 the global symmetry group of the theory is
accordingly:

h = su(2)l  su(2)r  su(2)i  u(1)r .

(2.27)

the twisting amounts to a redenition of the rotation group. if su(2)
subgroup of su(2)r  su(2)i then instead of k we take as rotation group

r is the diagonal

k  = su(2)l  su(2)

r ,

(2.28)

leaving u(1)r as the entire internal symmetry group. now let us see what happens to
the transformations of the elds under this redenition. the n = 2 algebra has a set
of supercharges qi and qi  which transform under h (the u(1) charge will not be
important in the following) as (1/2, 0, 1/2) and (0, 1/2, 1/2) respectively. they satisfy

} = 2m

{qi, qj
 pmj
i ,
{qi, qj} = ijz ,

where z is the central charge. under the new symmetry group

h  = su(2)l  su(2)

r  u(1)r ,

(2.29)

(2.30)

the supercharges will transform as (1/2, 1/2)  (0, 1)  (0, 0) (and this follows from the
fact that under su(2) we have: 2  2 = 3  1). here, the brst-like operator q that
we introduced before is identied with the (0, 0) component of the supercharge - it is
. what about the condition q2 = 0? after twisting this
follows directly from the supersymmetry algebra (2.29), at least when the central charge

the scalar operator q = q 

vanishes. however, even with a non-vanishing central charge, the theory continues to be

topological, since it is enough that q2 vanishes up to a gauge transformation [18].

it is now a rather straightforward matter to see how the action in (2.23) appears as the
twisting of the n = 2 theory. the n = 2 theory with elds in the adjoint representation
of su(2) has the following eld content [31]: a gauge eld a, a complex scalar eld b,

two majorana spinors i, i = 1, 2 (with 1 and 2 forming a doublet under su(2)i),
and their conjugates i . the action, in minkowski space with metric ( + ++), is [31]:

here the yang-mills eld strength is f = a  a + [a, a] and the covariant

(2.32)

with d = [b, b]. in passing from su(2)l  su(2)r  su(2)i to su(2)l  su(2)
quantum numbers of the various elds that appear in this action are changed as:

r, the

a (1/2, 1/2, 0)  (1/2, 1/2)
i (1/2, 0, 1/2)  (1/2, 1/2)
i  (0, 1/2, 1/2)  (0, 0)  (0, 1)

b (0, 0, 0)  (0, 0) .

(2.33)

in practice one is replacing the isospin indices i, j, . . . by an su(2)r index . for the
elds this means that the gauge eld is unchanged (a  a) and (b, b) is related
to (, ) in the twisted theory. i becomes a vector   and nally i  is a sum of a
scalar () and a selfdual two-form (). more concretely, we will make the following

identications in the topological theory:

 =     ,

i
22
b = 
b = 2 ,

,

while the scalar  and selfdual two-form  are identied through:

(2.34)

(2.35)

(  ) = 2() ()  ,

2also  = (1, ~), and  = (1,~) in terms of which  

spinor indices are raised and lowered with the antisymmetric tensor, 12 = 21 = 1.

4 ( 

      

   ). the

 =

 ,

25

where (  ) =   +  . it is possible to see that these identications will produce all

terms appearing in the topological action. after twisting, and rotating to euclidean
signature, the fermion kinetic term in the n = 2 action for example will give rise to the
fermion kinetic terms

 id + 2id ,

(2.36)

present in the donaldson-witten action. (the term r f f is a topological term that can

be added for free, since it changes neither the energy-momentum tensor nor the equations

of motion). as for the brst algebra (2.25) one starts by setting

i = 0 ,
   =    ,

(2.37)

where  is an anticommuting parameter. the supersymmetry transformations (2.32) then

become identical to the brst transformations given in (2.25)  though multiplied with

 on the right hand side, so that the symmetry  becomes bosonic.

observables

we will now discuss the relevant observables in the donaldson-witten theory. such
observables are cohomology classes of the brst operator, that is operators o (which we
require to be gauge invariant) such that {q,o} = 0 modulo exact operators o = {q, r}.
in practice the further condition that go = {q, r} will be satised by having simply o
independent of the metric on x.

we already have a non-trivial obvious candidate in the brst algebra (2.25). the

eld  is brst closed but not brst exact; also it is metric independent. a gauge

invariant expression is

w0(x) =

1
2

tr2(x) ,

(2.38)

where x is a point in x, and can be viewed as a zero form on x.

this enables us to dene a class of topological invariants on x as

hw0(x1)   w0(xk)i = z [d]es

k

yi=1

26

w0(xi) .

(2.39)

it is trivial to verify that this expression is metric independent, following the discussion

in the introduction.

while it might seem that this correlator depends on the distinct points x1, . . . xk this

is in fact not so. starting with w0(x), we can show that its derivative with respect to
the coordinate x is zero in the brst sense:

w0
x =

1
2


x (tr2(x)) = trd = i{q, tr} .

picking two points x and x in x we then have

w0(x)  w0(x) = i{q,z x

x

trdx} ,

or in innitesimal form:

dw0 = i{q, w1} ,

(2.40)

(2.41)

(2.42)

where w1 is the operator valued one-form w1 = tr.

it then follows directly from

(2.41) that

h(w0(x1)  w0(x
1)) 
which was what we initially set out to show.

k

yi=2

w0(xk)i = 0 ,

(2.43)

proceeding in this fashion we can generate a small tower of observables, wk, which

can be viewed as k forms on x, by solving the following set of equations:

dw1 = i{q, w2} , dw2 = i{q, w3} ,
dw3 = i{q, w4} , dw4 = 0 ,

(2.44)

(the last equation follows trivially from the fact that x is four-dimensional) which to-

gether with eq.

(2.42) are the so-called descent equations. the explicit form of the

operators wk can be computed by recursion; for illustrational purposes we will demon-

strate how w2 can be determined:

dw1 = trd(  ) = tr(d   +   d)

1
= i{q, tr(
2
 i{q, w2} .

   + i  f )}

(2.45)

27

in the second line we used the brst variation of the gauge eld strength that follows
from the brst algebra: f = i(d  d). the complete list of operators that
one obtains in this way is easily found:

w1 = tr(  ) , w2 = tr(
w3 = itr(  f ) , w4 = 

1
2
1
2

   + i  f ) ,
tr(f  f ) .

(2.46)

note that w4 integrated over x is just the familiar instanton number apart from a trivial
factor. by inspection the ghost numbers of wk are u = 4k, which of course also follows
directly from eq. (2.44).

the relevance of the descent equations is the following. if c is a circle in x then the

operator

is brst invariant, since (2.42) implies:

i1(c) = zc

w1

{q, i1(c)} = zc{q, w1} = izc

dw0 = 0 .

(2.47)

(2.48)

also, i1(c) only depends on the homology class of c (that is if c is a boundary then

this observable is trivial). this follows from the rst equation in (2.44). namely, if c is

the boundary of a surface, c = , then

i1(c) = zc

w1 = z

dw1 = i{q,z

w2} .

(2.49)

the observable is consequently trivial (in the brst sense) if c is a boundary. likewise,

if  is any surface in x then

is brst invariant; if k is a three-dimensional cycle in x then

i2() = z

w2

is brst invariant and nally

i3(k) = zk

w3

i4(m) = zx

w4

(2.50)

(2.51)

(2.52)

is brst invariant (and it is as stated before proportional to the instanton number). as

is the case for i1(c), all operators ik() only depend on the homology class of the cycle

.

28

donaldson invariants and polynomials

we are now in a position to dene the donaldson invariants. a natural assumption

in donaldson theory is  as we have mentioned already  that the four-manifold x is

simply connected, or that the fundamental group vanishes, 1(x) = 0. then, the only

possible nontrivial homology cycles are k-dimensional homology cycles for k = 0, 2, 4.

for k = 4, i4(x) is basically the instanton number which is a rather trivial invariant, so

the interesting cases are k = 0 or k = 2. for k = 0 the relevant operator is just w0(x)

and for k = 2 it is i2(s) where s is a two-dimensional surface in x.

the donaldson polynomials [16, 32] can now be described as certain polynomials in

the homology class of x (in this subsection we are using the same notation as in [33]):

de : h0(x, r)  h2(x, r)  r .

(2.53)

here e is an su(2) bundle over x. given that p  h0(x, r) is dened as having degree
4 and s  h2(x, r) degree 2 (i.e. identical to the ghost numbers of the aforementioned
observables), such a polynomial of degree n is expanded as:

de(p, s) = x2r+4s=n

srpsqr,s ,

(2.54)

such that n is the dimension of the instanton congurations on e and qr,s are rational

numbers which are dened by certain intersection numbers on the moduli space (the

details of which are not important for the discussion) 3.

a generating function for the donaldson polynomials can be obtained by summing

over all bundles e, that is, all possible instanton numbers:

x,g(p, s)  xr0,s0

sr
r!

ps
s!

qr,s .

(2.55)

the connection to wittens topological eld theory is as follows. previously, we dened

the observables w0(p) and i2(s). the main result of wittens seminal work [15] is that

the donaldson invariants can be identied with the following correlation functions:

qr,s  hw0(x1) . . . w0(xs)i2(s1) . . . i2(sr)i ,

(2.56)

3as an example, for x complex two-dimensional projective space p2, witten and moore found [33] a
complete expression for the donaldson polynomials with dn=2 = 3s/2, dn=10 = s5  ps3  13p2s/8,
etc.

29

computed in donaldson-witten theory, or phrased dierently that the generating function

for the donaldson polynomials is identied with:

x,g(p, s)  hew (p)+i2(s)i .

(2.57)

formally, these correlation functions are by construction topological invariants. however,
it is possible to show that this is only so when b+

2 is the dimension of the

2 > 1 (where b+

now, it is natural to ask under what conditions such correlation functions in eq.

(2.56) are trivial?

generically, and depending on the number of points and surfaces, such a correlation

function will vanish because the violation of the ghost number does not match the number

of zero modes in the path integral. the ghost number of w0 is u = 4 and of i2(s) it

is u = 2; it follows that the total ghost number of the correlation function in (2.56) is
2r + 4s - and this should be equal to the dimension of the instanton moduli space mk.
this dimension, on the other hand, is for su(2) [34]:

dimmk = 8k 

3
2

( + ) ,

(2.58)

with n the instanton number and  and  the euler characteristic and signature of

x respectively. the euler characteristic is computed as the alternating sum (x) =

pk(1)kbk, with bk = dimh k(x), and the signature as the dierence between positive

number of positive (negative) eigenvalues of q  this denition of b+

above-mentioned. then, on a simply connected four-manifold x we nd  +  = 2 + 2b+

the answer to the question is therefore that the correlation function in (2.56) will

(2.59)

this of course does not preclude that these invariants could be trivial for another reason.

generally, however, the computation of the invariants can be quite complicated since

they require knowledge about a space of su(2) instantons.

so historically, before the outcome of seiberg-witten theory, the donaldson invariants

where only known for few manifolds (except where they are trivial) and on kahler surfaces
where that had been computed by witten [30] as correlation functions in an n = 1 yang-
mills theory.

2.3 seiberg-witten theory in d = 4

so far we have presented a eld theoretic approach to the donaldson invariants which is
relevant at weak coupling (g  0) and can be obtained by twisting the n = 2 theory.
however, an important fact about n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory is that it is
asymptotically free - it is weakly coupled in the ultraviolet limit and strongly coupled in
the infrared limit. so by analyzing the infrared behavior of the n = 2 theory, it should
be possible to compute the donaldson invariants in a completely dierent way (since the

correlation functions in the topological theory are  at least formally  independent of

the coupling constant).

a requisite for understanding this approach is provided by the work of seiberg and
witten [2, 3] in which they show that the infrared limit of the n = 2 theory is equivalent
to a more tractable weak coupling limit of an abelian theory.

31

these two theories can each be twisted to give topological quantum eld theories. the

former is then related to donaldson-witten theory, or a theory of donaldson invariants.

the latter should then be related to a much simpler abelian theory, or a theory of what

is referred to as the seiberg-witten invariants.

the general idea is therefore as follows: we have two dual moduli problems, one of

instantons (rather complicated) and one of abelian monopoles (rather simple). instead

of computing the donaldson invariants from su(2) instanton solutions, one should be

able to compute the same invariants by using the solutions of the dual equations, which

involve monopoles of an abelian u(1) gauge theory.

the seiberg-witten solution

to understand the relation of the topological eld theories to physical theories, we will
review a few facts about the solution of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory on r4
as described in [2, 3]. introductions to the seiberg-witten solution of the n = 2 theory
can be found in [35, 36].

the pure n = 2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills action is:

s = im trz d4x



16 (cid:20)z d2w w +z d2d2 e2gv (cid:21) ,

(2.60)

here  is the chiral supereld, v the vector supereld and w the spinor supereld
constructed from v ; all elds are in the adjoint representation of su(2), that is  = ata
etc., where {ta} is a set of generators of the lie algebra su(2). furthermore,  is the
complex coupling constant:

 =


2

+

4i
g2

,

(2.61)

where g is the yang-mills coupling and  the qcd vacuum angle. classically, this theory
has a scalar potential v () = 1
2tr([, ]),  being the lowest scalar component of .
unbroken supersymmetry requires v () = 0, so the space of inequivalent vacua can be

parametrized by a complex parameter u, which is

u = htr 2i , hi =

1
2

a3 .

(2.62)

u is therefore a coordinate on the manifold of gauge inequivalent vacua, as it is easy to
see that one can always choose hi to be of the form in (2.62) with a being a complex

32

constant. the study of the n = 2 theory is basically the study of the global structure of
this moduli space and its singularities.

classically, the moduli space is given by the complex plane  or after adding a point at
innity, the riemann sphere. for u  , the theory becomes weakly coupled (because of
asymptotic freedom) and the su(2) gauge group is spontaneously broken down to u(1).

for small u, where perturbation theory breaks down, the theory gets strongly coupled

and the gauge symmetry is su(2) at the origin u = 0. however, at u = 0 the w  bosons

become massless and there is no description in terms of a wilsonian eective action. so

classically, the moduli space looks like a riemann sphere with two singularities at u = 0
and u = .

according to the seiberg-witten solution, the quantum moduli space looks like a
riemann sphere with singularities at u = 2,2 and , where  is the scale of the
n = 2 theory, see g. 2.3. but the su(2) gauge symmetry is never restored. instead the

figure 2.3: the classical moduli space has singularities at u = 0,;the quantum moduli
space at u = 2,.
eective theory is that of an n = 2 supersymmetric abelian gauge theory, which must
be of the general form

s = imz d4x

16 "z d2

2f
2 w w +z d2d2  f

# ,

(2.63)

where f () is the holomorphic prepotential, that determines the eective coupling con-
stant  as  = 2f /2. what seiberg and witten have achieved is to determine f
exactly in the quantum theory - which includes one-loop corrections and instanton con-
tributions - and thereby determined the complete low energy action of the n = 2 theory.
at u = 2 the eective theory is an n = 2 supersymmetric abelian gauge theory
coupled to a massless monopole (at u = 2 it is coupled to a massless dyon). and

33

there is a z2 symmetry (u  u) that relates the theories at these two singularities,
originating from the u(1)r symmetry of the classical action. these eective theories are

derived by the corresponding prepotential which in turn is determined by the periods of

a meromorphic dierential on the torus  given by:

y2 = (x2  4)(x  u) .

if  and  are the canonical basis homology cycles of the torus, and

 =

1
2

x2dx
y(x, u)

(2.64)

(2.65)

is the so-called seiberg-witten dierential, then the result is as follows: the local coordi-
nate a(u) around u =  is:

(2.66)

a(u) = z

 ,

while the coordinate ad(u) around u = +2 is determined by:

ad(u) = z

 .

(2.67)

the upshot is that a(u) and ad(u) are given by certain hypergeometric functions (see
e.g. [35]), which in turn determine the exact prepotential f (a) according to:

ad =


af (a) .

(2.68)

the dierent low energy eective descriptions are connected by duality transformations.
as an example, in going from the description around u =  to u = +2 the eective
complex coupling constant  is changed by the sl(2, z)-transformation   1/ (the
full duality group is actually sl(2, z), the same as the modular group of the torus ) 5.

why can this analysis be applied to a four-manifold x in the topological theory?

the reason is that in the twisted theory one can consider any riemann metric g on x

since correlation functions are independent of the metric. in particular, we can take the
family of metrics gt = t2g, with t > 0 and where g is a xed metric. note that t large

corresponds to large coupling constant.

5this is not an exact duality of the theory.

instead the duality group is acting on the various

lagrangian representations of the low energy eective behaviour of the theory.

34

for t  0 we get the witten approach to donaldson theory [15]. for t  , on
the other hand, one should expect that only the vacua of r4 are relevant (because the
manifold now looks locally at). here, twisting the quantum theory near u = 2
gives a topological quantum eld theory which is related to the moduli space of abelian
monopoles. actually, it is possible to show [33] that for manifolds with b+
2 > 1, only
contributions coming from u = 2 are important - and that contributions away from
these singularities vanish as powers of t for t  . for b+
2 = 1, there is a contribution
to the donaldson invariants from an integral over the u-plane, which has been calculated
explicitly [33], but we will only consider the case where b+

2 > 1, as it is much simpler to

analyze.

the monopole equations

the theory around the monopole singularity is that of an n = 2 supersymmetric abelian
gauge theory coupled to a massless hypermultiplet and the explicit form of the associated

topological abelian eld theory has been found [37] by twisting this theory as described

earlier for the case of donaldson theory.

while in donaldson theory, one studies solutions to the instanton equations, in the

seiberg-witten approach one studies what has become known as the seiberg-witten

monopole equations [5] (see e.g.

[38, 32] for a rather mathematical introduction). the

main feature is that they involve an abelian gauge potential a and a set of commuting

weyl spinors m and m , m being the hermitian conjugate of m.

strictly speaking, spinors can only be dened on manifolds which obey certain con-
(the second steifel-whitney class w2(x)  h 2(x, z2) should be trivial [27]
implying for example that cp 2 does not admit spinors). but here one only needs a

ditions.

so-called spinc structure, which can be dened on any oriented four-manifold [38] 6. but

we leave the technical diculties aside and assume that everything is working ne.

now, let x be an oriented, closed four-manifold with riemann metric g. we choose

6a positive chirality spinor is, in mathematical terms, a section of the spinor bundle s+, this however

might not be globally dened. the spinor m appearing in the monopole equations is a section of the
spinc-bundle s+  l1/2, where l is the u (1) line-bundle. so in physical terms what we are dealing with
are charged spinors.

8ij[i, j] (i, j = 1, . . . , 4) because we are
now working on a general (possibly non-at) four-manifold. note that there is a natural

action of the gauge group on the space of solutions to the equations in (2.71) by which
m is mapped to eim and a to a  . this leaves the equations in (2.71) invariant.
as discussed in [37, 39] one can write a completely analogous topological eld theory

based on these monopole equations (for a number of reviews, see e.g. [40, 41, 42]). let

us use the notation of [39] where the topological action is

and the bar indicates hermitian conjugation. in this form, it is clear that the dominant

contribution to the functional integral coming from the bosonic part of the action is given

by the solutions of the monopole equations (2.71).

while in donaldson theory we have a moduli space which is characterized by its

instanton number, the moduli in question is characterized by a monopole charge.

37

the weyl spinor m being charged under u(1), here we must consider a u(1) principle

bundle over the four-manifold x with an associated line bundle l. topologically a u(1)

bundle is characterized by the rst chern class

c1(f ) = [f/2]  h 2(x, z) .

(2.78)

introducing a basis i of h2(x, z) the monopole charges can then be obtained as the

total magnetic ux

mi = zi

c1 ,

(2.79)

integrated over the surface i. often the notation x = 2c1(l) is also used. the moduli
space  with xed monopole number x  of solutions to the monopole equations modulo
gauge transformations is denoted by mx. the dimension of this moduli space can be
determined by an index theorem [5] and is

d = 

2 + 3

4

+ c1(l)2 ,

(2.80)

where again  is the euler characteristic and  is the signature of x. it is possible to
show that the moduli space is a compact (and oriented) manifold [38]. indeed, |m| is
bounded by the scalar curvature of x  and there are accordingly no square-integrable

solutions on at r4. the (virtual) dimension of the moduli space vanishes, i.e. d = 0,

exactly when:

x2 = 2 + 3 ,

(2.81)

and, because of compactness, the moduli space will then consist of a nite number of

points denoted by pi,x, i = 1, . . . tx.

seiberg-witten invariants

now, because of orientability, with each such point pi,x one can associate a sign i,x = 1.
for each x for which the virtual dimension is zero, i.e. for which eq. (2.81) holds, one

can dene an integer nx as

nx = xi

i,x .

38

(2.82)

these quantities nx are the celebrated seiberg-witten invariants. for b+
2 > 1 they con-
stitute a set of dieomorphism invariants of four-manifolds [38] 7. because of a vanishing

argument, described later, a given four-manifold will only have a nite number of xs for
which nx 6= 0. on manifolds for which there are only trivial solutions to the monopole
equations, these invariants will of course all vanish.

with these invariants at hand, a number of interesting results can be obtained  some

completely new results and some often in a much simpler way than with the donaldson

invariants.

first of all, the partition function of donaldson-witten theory can be calculated at

strong coupling with the result ( see e.g. [42]):

z = cxx

(x2  2  3)hnx + inxi ,

(2.83)

where  = ( + )/4 and the constant c in front can be xed by requiring agreement

with the result at weak coupling [30] and is a topological number:

c = 21+ 1

4 (7+11) .

(2.84)

the delta function in (2.83) means that only zero-dimensional moduli spaces contribute.

the second factor is a contribution coming from two parts: one from the singularity at
u = +2 and one from the one at u = 2.

if the u-plane had more than these two singularities, the result in (2.83) would have

been radically dierent.

secondly, it is natural to ask how these seiberg-witten invariants are related to the

donaldson invariants? 8 in donaldson theory  at least for simply connected x  there

7in order to show topological invariance one has to show that the nx is constant on a path connecting

two metrics. invariance can then fail if there are singularities and they appear if the gauge group does not
act freely on the space of solutions. a solution with m = 0 has f + = 0, i.e. is an abelian instanton, that
can be identied with an element in h 2
 and this is generically empty for b+

(x, r). now, f/2  h 2(x, z), so f/2  h 2(x, z)h 2
2 > 1 [38]. to resume: when b+

2 > 1 there are no abelian instantons.
8the conjecture to be presented below in eq. (2.86) would seem to indicate that the seiberg-witten

(x, r)

invariants should contain more information than the donaldson invariants since the latter have been
derived from a zero-dimensional moduli space mx (and no knowledge about the positive dimension
moduli spaces has been used). but since correlation functions in the topological theory are  at least

39

are two important observables, namely an operator i() of ghost number two (where 

is any two-dimensional homology cycle) and an operator of dimension four w0.

the generating function for the donaldson invariants is

hexp xi

ii(i) + w0!i ,

(2.85)

where it is understood that one is summing over instanton numbers. here i is a basis

of h2(x, z), i.e. i = 1, . . . , dimh2(x, z), and , i are complex numbers.

using the same notation as in [5], we dene v = pi i[i]; here [i] is the element
in h 2(x, z) which is poincare dual to i; v2 = pi,j iji  j, where i  j is the
9. also we dene v  x = pi i(i, x) for any x 

intersection number of i and j
h 2(x, z).

for manifolds of simple type, that is one for which the generating function in (2.55)

obeys 2/2  4 = 0, the following relation has been derived by witten [5]:

hexp xi

ii(i) + w0!i = 21+ 1

4 (7+11) exp  v2
+i exp 

+ 2!xx
2  2!xx

v2

2

nxevx

nxeivx! .

(2.86)

for a sketch of the derivation, see [42]. as for the partition function there is one important

comment. the rst term on the right hand side

exp  v2

2

+ 2!xx

nxevx ,

(2.87)

is the contribution from the u-plane singularity at u = 2; the second term on the right

hand side

exp 

v2

2  2!xx

nxeivx ,

(2.88)

comes from the singularity at u = 2. if the vacuum structure had been dierent from
the one predicted by seiberg and witten [2, 3] the resulting relation would have been

very dierent with additional terms from other singularities.

formally  independent of the coupling constant we should expect the invariants to contain exactly the

same information.

9the intersection number of i and j is the number of points in i  j counted with orientation.

40

note that these results depend crucially on the connection to the quantum eld theory

formulation of donaldson theory and are not proved rigorously. so there is at least no

mathematical proof of the conjectured relation between donaldson and seiberg-witten

invariants.

however, the form of (2.86) agrees with a result proved by kronheimer and mrowka

for manifolds of simple type [43], in which the nx were unknown coecients.

witten was able to x the coecient 21+ 1

4 (7+11) by requiring agreement with com-

putations on kahler manifolds and other manifolds where the donaldson invariants can

be computed explicitly [30]. it has later been shown that the resulting formula agrees

with all cases, where the donaldson invariants are known.

but one does not necessarily need the relation  as conjectured from quantum eld

theory  between donaldson and seiberg-witten invariants.

indeed, completely inde-

pendent of this, the task of analyzing the solutions of the monopole equations and the

connected seiberg-witten invariants is a well-dened mathematical problem, that has

been shown to lead to many interesting results in topology. (and this is one reason why

they have proven to be so important in the mathematics literature).

as an example, we could mention the celebrated proof of the thom conjecture for
embedded surfaces in cp2 by kronheimer and mrowka [44]. by studying the monopole
equations on the four-manifold x = r  s1  , kronheimer and mrowka showed that
if  is an oriented two-manifold embedded in cp2 and representing the same homology
class as an algebraic curve of degree d, then the genus of  satises: g  (d 1)(d 2)/2.
for further discussion, see [38, 32].

as a further check witten has been able to compute the invariants exactly on kahler

manifolds, where they are non-vanishing [5].

vanishing theorems

among the most important applications of the seiberg-witten equations are the so-called

vanishing theorems that follow from (2.71).

from a strictly mathematical point of view, these vanishing theorems can be rigorously

derived from (2.71) without the use of physical arguments.

(2.92)

an immediate consequence is the following vanishing theorem: if (a, m) is a solution to
(2.71) and the scalar curvature of x is positive, r  0, then

f +

 = 0 , m = 0 ,

(2.93)

i.e. the only solutions are from the abelian instanton equations. this in turn implies [5]
that a four-manifold x with b+
is nx 6= 0 for some x, cannot have a metric with positive scalar curvature.

2 > 0 and non-vanishing seiberg-witten invariants, that

as another application of such vanishing arguments, witten has shown [5] that the

seiberg-witten invariants vanish on manifolds which are connected sums x#y when
b+
2 > 0 on both x and y , see g. 2.2.

the curvature scalar r can be taken positive on such a tube and any solution of the

seiberg-witten equations can therefore be brought to vanish on it, at least when the

tube is taken to be very long. then one can dene a u(1) action on the moduli space

42

of solutions. this is obtained by gauge transforming the solutions on x with a constant

gauge transformation that keeps the elds on y xed. the xed points of this action
are solutions with m = 0 on x or y , but for b+

2 > 0 one can argue that the only such
solutions are the trivial ones. so we have a free action on a set of points and this set

must therefore be empty.

in particular it follows that four-dimensional kahler manifolds cannot be obtained as

connected sums, since witten showed [5] that kahler manifolds have nontrivial invariants.

as stated previously, for a given four-manifold x, there will only be a nite number
xs for which the seiberg-witten invariants nx 6= 0. this is derived from the following
vanishing theorem [5]. throwing away the |dm|2-term in (2.92) we have,

one can argue that there are only nitely many line-bundles l for which bothrx d4xg|f |2

are bounded [38]  and hence for every four-manifold x, there will only be a nite number

of non-trivial invariants nx.

a number of similar vanishing theorems can also be derived in the lower-dimensional

versions of seiberg-witten theory.

2.4 seiberg-witten duality in d < 4

having considered the seiberg-witten duality applied to topological theories in four di-

mensions, it becomes natural to ask what happens in lower dimensions? dimensionally

43

reducing the four-dimensional theory by taking x = xn  t 4n for n = 2, 3 with the ra-
dius of the compact directions going to zero, one obtains dimensionally reduced theories

in three and two dimensions which by construction are topological [19].

such dimensional reductions of donaldson-witten theory have been known for a long

time [46, 47] (and is briey reviewed below). as far as topological properties are con-

cerned, the analogous dimensional reductions of the four-dimensional dual theory should

provide new abelian topological theories which are duals of the dimensionally reduced

donaldson-witten theories.

as in [19] we start by dimensionally reducing the donaldson-witten theory in four

dimensions with an action given in (2.23). concretely, we take x to be a product manifold
x = y  s1 with signature (++++) and assume that all elds are x0-independent. here
y is a compact and oriented three-manifold. furthermore, we dene i  0i such that
ij = ijkk. this gives the three-dimensional action (i, j, k = 1, 2, 3),

(2.101)

these equations have been studied, in the context of riemann surfaces, by hitchin [20]

(though he mainly concentrated on the case where the gauge group is so(3), rather

than su(2)). the main points following from hitchins analysis are: (1) that the moduli
space of solutions modulo gauge transformations is a smooth noncompact manifold m
of dimension 12(g  1), where g is the genus of the riemann surface; (2) that there is a
vanishing theorem related to the solutions of (2.101), similar to the vanishing theorem of

donaldson theory in four dimensions and (3) that it is possible to prove the uniformization
theorem: that every compact riemann surface of genus g  2 admits a metric of constant
negative curvature. it would be nice if one could give a simple proof of this uniformization

theorem by using the two-dimensional version of the seiberg-witten equations.

however, it would take us to far astray to go into detail with all this, but the main

point is that the moduli space of solutions to (2.101) is an object which has some relevance

in the mathematics literature. also chapline and grossman [47] has been considering

these equations, thereby indicating a connecting of conformal eld theory to donaldson

theory. this seems to indicate a possible physical relevance of these equations, how-

ever it is not clear whether their results have any signication relation to the analogous

45

dimensionally reduced monopole equations in two dimensions 10.

now we can turn to the analogous dimensional reduction of the dual theory, which is
an abelian gauge theory with action given in (2.76). by taking x = y  s1 as before
the dimensionally reduced action becomes:

where i  0i and k = ek

(2.102)

generally, computing donaldson invariants on y  s1, with the radius of the s1 going

to zero, one would expect to obtain invariants of the three-manifold y .

using donaldson-witten theory, the partition function related to (2.23) on y  s1
computes the so-called rozansky-witten invariant of y [48]. on the seiberg-witten side,

it has been shown that the partition function of the three-dimensional theory (2.102) gives

a seiberg-witten version of the so-called casson invariant [39] (as discussed in [49] this,

however, only holds when b1(y ) > 1). a further discussion of this three-dimensional

case, which also discusses a non-abelian version of the seiberg-witten monopoles can be

found in [50].

the three-dimensional version of the monopole equations can be obtained from the

local minima of the classical part of the action in (2.102). these equations are accordingly:

fij  ijkm km = 0 ,
dam = 0 ,

0 = 0 ,

(2.103)

but of course they could have been derived directly by dimensionally reducing the four-

dimensional monopole equations (2.71). in (2.103) the last condition is only necessary if

we have a nontrivial solution. otherwise, it can be replaced by the condition d0 = 0.

10the hitchin equations also naturally appear in two-dimensional bf gravity [18] as equations of

motion of the zwei-bein and spin-connection. but we will not try to relate this to the two-dimensional

monopole equations.

we have dened   1, h   h 0 and h  h 1.

computing donaldson invariants on s1, with the radius of the circle going to zero,
one would  as in the three-dimensional case  expect to obtain invariants of the two-

manifold . however, when  is a compact orientable surface its topology is uniquely

characterized by a single integer, the genus g, so any non-trivial topological invariant

will be a function of g and hence contains at most as much information as the function

f (g) = g. so (at least a priori) nothing interesting seems to be obtained in this direction.

as for the monopole equations they are either inferred from reducing the three-

dimensional monopole equations further to two dimensions, or as the minima of the

classical part of the action (2.104), which is:

(2.106)

the two-dimensional variant of the seiberg-witten equations are consequently as follows:

f  m 1m = 0 ,
dam = 0 ,

mm = 0 ,

0 = 0 ,

1 = 0 .

(2.107)

if (a, m) is a trivial solution, then the last two conditions can be replaced by d0 =

d1 = 0.

though very similar to hitchins self-duality equations these equations of course de-

scribe a totally dierent moduli space: the former is a moduli space of solutions to a

u(1)-problem while the latter is related to su(2) instantons. however, as is the case

in four dimensions, it should be possible to obtain  in a simple way  result obtained

by studying solutions of the hitchin equations, in terms of the moduli space correspond-

ing to monopole equations as (2.107). to my knowledge, this has not been done in the

literature.

however, a number of vanishing theorems, similar to those previously considered in

four dimensions can be derived in this context of a two-dimensional surface  [19, 44].

in fact, it follows from eq. (2.107), that if (a, m) is a solution of the two-dimensional

monopole equations then the pair must obey the following identity [19]

d2xg(

z

(2.108)

where r is the scalar curvature. if there is a metric so that r is positive on x then this

implies that f = 0 and m = 0 are the only solutions. on a sphere, for example, we are

actually looking at at abelian connections. one might therefore naively worry that on
a surface of genus g there are only trivial solutions. however, a surface of genus g  2
admits a metric of constant negative curvature and the argument does not apply.

without assuming any positivity of the scalar curvature one can also derive the fol-

lowing inequality:

z

d2xgr2 .

48

(2.109)

inserting this in (2.107) on gets an upper bound on |m|4 and this implies that the moduli
space is compact as in four dimensions.

another variant of such vanishing arguments shows that if  is a genus g surface
(taken to be of unit area and constant scalar curvature 4(2g 2)) then the rst chern
number is bounded as [44]:

|c1()| = |

1

2 z

f|  2g  2 .

(2.110)

this result (which basically is just (2.109) in another disguise) plays an important role

in the proof of the thom conjecture by kronheimer and mrowka [44].

finally, let us mention that some explicit solutions to the monopole equations on r2

have been constructed in [51] and the solutions turn out to be vortex congurations. they

are singular, as are the analogous solutions, given by freund [52], in r3. as noted by wit-
ten in [5], the monopole equations admit no square-integrable solutions on at rn, n  4.

the seiberg-witten equations have been generalized to non-abelian monopoles, mainly

by labastida and marino and is reviewed in [40]. furthermore, the donaldson invariants
have been computed by, e.g., moore and witten on four-manifolds with b+

2 = 1 [33] and
in the latter case the

by marino and moore on non-simply connected manifolds [53].

invariants are not really invariants since they are not constant functions on the space

of metrics but only piecewise constant.

the generalization to non-abelian monopoles is especially interesting since mathe-

maticians are studying these to come up with a mathematical proof of the equivalence of

donaldson-witten and seiberg-witten invariants. the idea being that both the instan-

ton and the abelian seiberg-witten moduli space appear as boundaries of a so-called

non-abelian p u(2)-moduli space and that some cobordism argument may then relate

the two, see [54].

chapter 3

t-duality in string theory and in

sigma models

in this chapter we will be focusing on one duality, namely that of t -duality (a useful

reference is [55]), and we will be analyzing some consequences imposed by this dual-

ity in a variety of sigma models (both bosonic, supersymmetric and heterotic models).

these consequences can be formulated as a certain relation between t -duality and the

renormalization group ow (operator r) of such models, namely that they commute:

[t, r] = 0.

we will start by describing t -duality as a perturbative (order by order) symmetry of

string theory. then we consider the restrictions of scale and weyl invariance for consis-

tent string propagation. such invariances are not mandatory for general two-dimensional

sigma models which we treat in the rest of the chapter but are related to the renor-

malization group (rg) ow of such models. accordingly, in the following sections we

study the relation between t -duality and rg ow  as dened by the beta functions in

bosonic sigma models, and the extend to which our hypothetical relation, [t, r] = 0,

determines the exact rg ow. then we treat the case of supersymmetric and heterotic

sigma models in a simplied setting. in both cases it turns out that duality implies strong

constraints on the rg ow.

50

3.1 introduction

t -duality is one of the most important dualities in string theory. it was rst discovered

in the context of toroidal compactications of closed strings as an invariance under the

change of compactication radius from r to /r [56]. later it was shown that this sym-

metry appears not only in toroidal compactications, but in all target space backgrounds

with isometries [57, 58].

the main property of string theory that enables a t -duality is that, in a space with

compact dimensions, strings can wrap around nontrivial loops. at the same time, the

momentum of the string must be quantized along these compact directions. t -duality is

basically a symmetry under interchange of these wrapping and momentum modes.

to set the scene we start with the free string action describing a closed string moving

in at minkowski spacetime

s0 =

1

4 z

d2[ax ax + fermions] ,

(3.1)

where t = 1

2 is the string tension. the parameter  plays the role of plancks constant
such that quantum mechanical perturbation theory for strings is an expansion in . the

classical limit then corresponds to  small. the integration is over the worldsheet 

which we take to be without boundary and orientable - this is the description relevant for
closed strings. the local coordinates on this worldsheet are (,  ) with 0    2 and
periodic and with  <  < . in (3.1), the spacetime coordinates x (, ) describe
the embedding of the string in spacetime. the fermion terms depend on which kind of

string theory we are considering. for the bosonic string such model dependent terms are

absent.

in the case of the superstring, the action contains fermionic degrees of freedom 

residing on the worldsheet. as we go around the periodic direction, the fermions can

either be periodic or anti-periodic thereby giving rise to a total of four dierent sectors

as the left- and right-moving modes are treated independently. the ramond (r) fermion

is periodic, while the neveu-schwarz (ns) fermion is anti-periodic. the ns-ns sector

contains massless spacetime bosons, namely a graviton (g), an antisymmetric tensor

(b) and a scalar dilaton (). the fundamental string is charged under the two-form

51

b. the r-r sector also contains bosons, which are antisymmetric tensor elds cp.

such elds will not play any role in this chapter, but are relevant for the understanding

of non-perturbative string theory as discussed in chapter 4. for completeness, we should

mention that the r-ns and ns-r sectors gives the spacetime fermions.

two classical symmetries of the action in (3.1) will be important in the following:

the action is invariant under dieomorphisms of the worldsheet, which is just a change
in the coordinates (,  )  (,  ) and also invariant under local weyl symmetry by
which is meant a scaling of the worldsheet metric according to hab  e2(, )hab. on a
at worldsheet this is a conformal symmetry in which case it implies that the classical

energy-momentum tensor vanishes:

tab = 

2
h

s0
hab = 0 .

(3.2)

we have started with a theory of strings moving in 26-dimensional spacetime (ten-

dimensional for the superstrings). to make the connection with the real (observed)

world, we should consider compactications of string theory. this means that we take
our spacetime to be a product m 26dk d where usually m 26d is at (26d)-dimensional
minkowski space and k d is some compact manifold. the simplest compactication is

compactication on a circle, k d = s1. choosing x 25 as the coordinate curcumnavigating
the circle, we must identify x 25  x 25 + 2r since the wave function should be single
valued. hence, the center of mass momentum is quantized in units of 1/r along this

direction: p 25 = n/r. the string can wind around the circle any number of times so

that if we go along the compactied dimension the string coordinate x 25 does not have

to come back to itself, rather

x 25(,  + 2) = x 25(, ) + 2mr , m  z .

(3.3)

the two integers (n, m) are called momentum and winding modes respectively and are

conserved charges.

let us analyze what the appearance of these modes implies for the mode expansion of

the elds x . the equation of motion following from the action (3.1) is a wave equation

that implies that the elds can be written as a sum of a left and a right-moving part:

x  = x 

l( + ) + x 

r(  )

(3.4)

52

and the periodicity of the -coordinate implies that the mode expansions are

l = x

where x

it then follows that

now, the spectrum of the string theory is determined by the mass-shell condition [23]:

(3.8)

where p is the momentum in the noncompact directions and nl and nr are the oscillator

levels of the string.

it follows from (3.8) that the spectrum is invariant under the interchange of momen-

tum and winding modes (n  m), if we change r according to

r  /r .

(3.9)

this symmetry of string theory is called target space duality (or t -duality for short). the

result in (3.9) means that compactication on a small radius (r/  1) is equivalent
to compactication on a large radius (r/  1). this is of course very interesting and

dierent from the situation in eld theory since a particle will have a spectrum which is

basically only determined by the momentum in the compact direction - there is no such

thing as a winding number!

53

also t -duality seems to suggest that there is a minimum length scale in string theory:

by using one or the other formulation we can restrict to r  .

another important interpretation of t -duality is that it can be seen as a parity trans-

formation on the right-moving coordinates:

in terms of the left- and right-moving mo-

mentum (3.7), the t -duality transformation is simply:

without changing the spectrum, one can also change the oscillator modes according to

l  p25
p25
l ,

r  p25
p25
r .

(3.10)

25
n  25
n ,

25
n  25
n .

(3.11)

this means  because of (3.5)  that t -duality can be viewed as the transformation

x 25 = x 25

l + x 25

r  x 25 = x 25

l  x 25
r ,

(3.12)

which is a spacetime parity transformation that acts only on the right-movers (in the case

of superstrings, this would be supplemented with the transformation of the worldsheet
fermion r  r, in the directions where duality is performed).

so far we have considered free string theory. however, the t -duality transformation

also acts nontrivially on the string coupling constant, which is determined by the dilaton
as g = hei. the transformation can be determined by noting that the 25-dimensional
coupling constant g25 is related to the 26-dimensional coupling by

g2 = 2rg2

25 ,

(3.13)

and must be invariant under duality (since the t -duality only acts in the 26th direction),

so

g2  g2 =

2

r

g2
25 .

in conclusion t -duality must act as

r  r = /r , g  g =

g
r

.

(3.14)

(3.15)

these transformations were rst derived by buscher [57] by requiring duality to be a

symmetry of the full string theory with interactions. moreover, since the coupling con-

stant is basically unchanged, this duality transformation maps the weak coupling limit of

54

one theory to the weak coupling limit of another theory. as an example, it is seen that

this procedure yields a duality between type iia string theory compactied on a circle

of radius r and type iib theory compactied on a circle of radius /r [59, 60].

the description relevant for strings moving in a more general background than a at

minkowski spacetime can be obtained given a nontrivial vacuum expectation value for

the massless ns-ns bosons g, b and . these can be incorporated by using the vertex

operators of the massless elds [23]. this gives the following generalization of (3.1) as

the worldsheet action describing a string moving in a curved background:

s =

1

4 z

d2h "habg(x) +

iab
h

b (x)# ax bx  +

1

4 z

d2h r(2)(x) .

(3.16)

here hab is the worldsheet metric, g(x) is the background metric, b(x) is the anti-
symmetric tensor and (x) is the dilaton eld. r(2) is the worldsheet ricci scalar, so the
last term is only relevant on a curved worldsheet. x () gives a map   m from the
worldsheet into the target space m and can conveniently be thought of as dening local

coordinates on m. m is then some riemann manifold with metric tensor g.

historically, an action of the form (3.16) arise in the context of what is called a non-

linear sigma model. in contrast to the minkowski space action (3.1), this action (3.16)

is no longer quadratic in x  and accordingly it describes an interacting two-dimensional

eld theory.

however, not every such background  as dened by g, b and   yields a consistent

string theory. the values of these background elds are restricted by demanding local

scale invariance or conformal invariance.

scale and weyl invariance

let us start by considering invariance under global scale transformations. classically

(3.1) and (3.16) are invariant under scale transformations. this is not necessarily true in

the corresponding quantum theory as is seen by considering the scale transformation of

the at worldsheet metric:

hab = hab .

(3.17)

55

the resulting change in the partition function is





2 z d2ht a

a()i ,

(3.18)

where t ab is the energy-momentum tensor. scale invariance therefore requires t a
a =
aoa, for oa some local operators. in classical eld theory scale invariance is insured
if the coupling constants are dimensionless (the lagrangian contains no dimensionfull

parameters). however divergences in the quantum theory gives rise to a non-vanishing

renormalization group (rg) beta function with the consequence that the eective cou-

pling depends on the length scale. for the sigma models in question, the relevant beta

functions (or actually beta functionals) are

g
  

d

d
d

b ,

 ,

(3.19)

where  is the appropriate renormalization scale parameter. note that eq. (3.19) de-

scribe a change in geometry.

the renormalization properties of the non-linear sigma model in (3.16) has been

studied extensively in the literature, see e.g. [61, 62].

in string theory, scale invariance alone does not ensure consistency. for this also

weyl invariance is required. classically, the two rst terms in (3.16) are also invariant

under weyl rescalings of the worldsheet metric, while the last term breaks it explicitly.

consider now a weyl transformation of the worldsheet metric

hab = 2()hab .

the resulting change in the partition function is

1

2 z d2qh()()ht a

a()i .

(3.20)

(3.21)


so weyl invariance requires t a

a = 0, which evidently is a stronger condition than scale
invariance. in the classical theory, given by (3.1), this trace is identically zero. indeed,

this follows from the fact that the classical energy momentum tensor vanishes (3.2). in

the quantum theory t a

a does not vanish and it implies that there is an anomaly in the
local worldsheet symmetry. this is the so-called weyl anomaly. the propagation of

the string is only consistent if this anomaly vanishes (in the light-cone gauge it can for

56

example be shown that the theory is only lorentz invariant if the anomaly is vanishing

[63]).

as a side remark we note that t a

a ought to vanish on a at worldsheet where we have

conformal invariance. this determines

t a

a = a1r(2) ,

(3.22)

where a1 is a constant and r(2) is the ricci scalar of the worldsheet. the computation

of a1 is straightforward and the result is [64]:

a1 = 

c
12

,

(3.23)

where c is the total central charge of the worldsheet conformal eld theory. so weyl

invariance is the same as demanding that the total central charge c is zero. this in turn

determines the dimension of at spacetime: the bosonic string propagates in d = 26

dimensions and the superstring in d = 10 dimensions.1

the sigma model in (3.16) is - as indicated above - not conformally invariant for

all backgrounds. the necessary conditions on the background can be calculated using

dimensional regularization in 2 +  dimensions and calculating those terms of the action
that violate the symmetry at the quantum level in the limit   0. the possible values
of the couplings are then determined by requiring the vanishing of these terms. in terms
of the so-called weyl anomaly coecients g

(3.25)

1the total central charge of the bosonic string conformal eld theory is the sum of the matter central

charge and ghost central charge: c = cx + cg. the ghost conformal eld theory is a bc-theory with
central charge cg = 26, so c = cx  26. each free eld x  adds +1 to the total central charge and
consequently there must be 26 of such elds for the theory to be weyl invariant [23].

(3.31)

comparing the result in (3.23) with (3.24), we see 2 that a background (g, b, ) with
g

 = 0 describes a conformal eld theory of central charge c = 6 . hence,
from (3.24) we conclude that the requirement of conformal invariance or consistent string

propagation is tantamount to the condition that the weyl anomaly coecients associated

with the background must vanish, i.e.

g
 = b

 = 0 .

(3.32)

there is, in fact, a simple physical interpretation of this condition. the equation g

 = 0
looks like an einstein equation (i.e. r = 0) with source terms coming from dilaton
and antisymmetric tensor elds. also, the equation b
equation (i.e. f = 0) generalized to the antisymmetric tensor eld.

higher order terms in  gives stringy corrections to these einstein-like equations.

at two-loop there is  as we shall discuss later  a correction term to the metric beta

function of the form

(3.33)

which gives a correction to the einstein equations.

2according to the so-called curci-pauti theorem [68], g

and therefore can be interpreted as a central charge. i thank h. dorn for pointing out this reference.

in general relativity, the empty space einstein equation can be derived as the equa-

tion of motion from an action of the form

se  z ddxgr .

(3.34)

an obvious question then is whether it is possible to give a physically sensible interpre-

tation of all the equations in (3.32) as equations of motion of an eective low energy

action? the answer is armative and to lowest order in  that eective action is [23]:

s =

3

+ r 

1
12

hh  + 4# ,

(3.35)

where 1/2

0 is the gravitational constant. this is the eective action that is expected to
appear after integrating out all the massive modes of the string and as such it is a low

energy eective action. the action is written in terms of the so-called string metric g

and has a nonstandard normalization of the r term. the action can be written in the
standard form (as in eq. (3.34)) by using instead the einstein metric g = e2kg,

where k is a constant to be determined below. more generally, with two metrics related
by a spacetime weyl transformation as g = 2(x)g, the ricci scalars are related as

[69] (p. 446):

r = 2(cid:16)r  2(d  1)2 ln   (d  2)(d  1)( ln )( ln )(cid:17) .

for  = ek this is

r = e2k(cid:16)r + 2k(d  1)2  k 2(d  2)(d  1)()2(cid:17) ,

(3.36)

(3.37)

so to cancel the unwanted dilaton factor in (3.35) we should take k = 2/(d  2).
with this choice one nds the following expression for the eective action in terms of the

einstein metric:

the variation with respect to the metric background is more complicated. first we need

(3.44)

which is obtained by a partial integration and using that the metric is covariantly con-

which implies  = 0, so that indeed the equations of motion of (3.35) imply that the

weyl anomaly coecients vanish.

t -duality of sigma models

so far we have focused on t -duality in string theory and on the sigma model description

of string propagation in curved backgrounds. while it is true that consistent string

propagation requires conformal invariance on the worldsheet (and hence vanishing of the

weyl anomaly coecients), this is not a requirement for the existence of a t -duality

in general. as the set of conformal backgrounds is just a small subset of all possible

backgrounds, it seems natural to extend the action of duality to all such backgrounds.

following this philosophy, we will henceforth be studying the properties of the sigma

model (which we rst take to be bosonic) away from the conformal point. first we derive

the t -duality transformations of any bosonic sigma model with a target space isometry

and then we study the implications of this duality on the renormalization group ow of

the model.

61

in order to derive the duality transformations  which we will do in a truncated model

where  is identically zero  relating dierent sigma model backgrounds, we will assume

that the target space has an abelian isometry which can be represented as a translation

in a coordinate x 0 in the target space.
it is then simple to see that we can choose
adapted coordinates {x 0, x i} such that the background elds are independent of x 0.
to be more precise, we start by assuming that the action (3.16) is invariant under an

isometry in the target space. the corresponding killing vector is denoted by k

x  = k .

(3.52)

a straightforward generalization of this is to have several killing vectors forming an

abelian or maybe non-abelian group. we will not discuss that generalization here.

requiring invariance of the action under the killing symmetry gives us some condi-

tions on the background elds. the rst is that the lie derivative of the metric with

respect to the killing vector vanishes:

also, there must exist some vector  such that

lkg = k + k = 0 .

lkb =    .

(3.53)

(3.54)

in adapted coordinates, the isometry acts in the x 0-direction as a translation x 0 
x 0 + . so k = k 
x 0 and the lie derivative is then just the derivative with
it is then obvious that the background metric is independent of x 0.

respect to x 0.

x  = 

there would seem to be a problem though since the lie derivative of the antisymmetric

tensor is generally not zero but equal to the exterior derivative of a one-form, but actually

there is no problem since the action obviously has a gauge symmetry under which

with  some one-form. in the gauge where

b  b + d

lk =  ,

we nd

lk(b + d) = lkb + d(lk) = d + d() = 0 ,

62

(3.55)

(3.56)

(3.57)

so that all background elds are actually independent of x 0. in the following we will

assume that such adapted coordinates have been chosen.

to nd the dual model we will gauge the isometry in the target space (3.52) by
introducing a gauge eld a that transforms as a =  [70]. adding a lagrange
multiplier term forces the gauge eld to be a pure gauge. the gauged action is then

sgauged =

(gab + iabb)dax dbx 

1

4 z
4 z

i

+

where we have dened dax  = ax  + kaa, and x 0 acts as a lagrange multiplier. the
dual theory is obtained by integrating the a-eld

x 0(aab  baa)ab,

(3.58)

aa = 

1
k2 (kgax  + ia

bb x 0 + ia

bkb bx ) ,

(3.59)

which is inserted back into the action (3.58) and then xing the gauge with the condition

x 0 = 0. subsequently, the following expression for the dual action is obtained:

s =

(3.60)

so the dual background - which is what we intended to derive - is given by

(3.61)

this expression was rst derived by buscher [57]. there is also a dilaton shift [57]

 =

ln g00 .

(3.62)

as is clear from the action (3.16), this is, however, a one-loop eect. basically, this

eect follows from the fact that the t -duality acts nontrivially on the coupling constant.

indeed, the string coupling is determined by the expectation value of the dilaton eld,
since g = hei, and it therefore follows from ( 3.15) that
ln(r2/) .

duality and renormalization group flow

having considered the renormalization group ow (as encoded by the beta functions) of

bosonic sigma models and the t -duality of such models, it remains to connect these two

subjects.

more generally, one could enquire as to what restrictions can be imposed by duality

in quantum eld theory and string theory? an important tool in that direction is that

of a moduli space, which typically will parametrize a family of quantum eld theories.

a point in moduli space is then given by a set of parameters (1, 2, . . .). consider for
example the moduli space of toroidal (s1) compactications of bosonic string theory.

such a parameter is then the radius r of the compactifying circle. what t -duality tells

us in this case is that the point  = r in parameter space determines the same (bosonic)

string theory as that of  = 1/r. (or that the moduli space should be modded out

by z2). so in this respect duality symmetry acts as a transformation in moduli (or

parameter) space while leaving the partition function invariant.

another transformation that also acts naturally on this parameter space, is the one

of the renormalization group.

in quantum eld theory a central concept is that of regularization and renormaliza-

tion. after proper renormalization the couplings of the theory will be functions of a

renormalization scale . the ow of the parameters is then determined by the renormal-

ization group (rg). this rg also acts naturally in the parameter space as it determines

the change in the renormalized parameters as we change the renormalization scale. 3

with both the t -duality and the rg acting as motions in the parameter space it

becomes natural to study the interrelation between the two operators (early related work

was done by lutken [71], in which he studied some constraints on the rg ow from

duality in the ising model and the quantum hall eect).

the requirement that duality symmetry and the rg be mutually consistent is formu-

lated as follows. in full generality, we will assume that we have a system with a parameter

space parametrized by a set of couplings, gi. the duality symmetry t (which later ac-

3actually, since the rg is encoded in the beta functions which can be viewed as tangent vectors on
the parameter space, it would be more correct to say that the rg acts on the tangent space tm of the
parameter space m.

64

tually will mean the usual target space duality) acts on the parameter space according

to

t gi  gi = gi(g) ,

(3.64)

and connects equivalent points in parameter space  as the r  /r symmetry of string
theory. the renormalization group ow, on the other hand, is given in terms of a set of

beta functions

rgi  i(g) = 

d
d

gi ,

(3.65)

where  is the renormalization scale parameter. more generally, if f (g) is any function

on the parameter space then the action of these operations are

t f (g) = f (g(g))

rf (g) =

f (g)

gj

 j(g) .

(3.66)

the hypothesis that we will bring forward is that the consistency requirement governing

the relation between duality and the rg is expressed by [72]:

[t, r] = 0 ,

(3.67)

which simply asserts that the duality transformations and the rg ow are mutually

commuting operators on the parameter space of the theory. eq. (3.67) is seen to be

equivalent to the following relations between beta functions in the original and the dual

theory:

i(g) =

gi
gj  j(g) ,

(3.68)

or that the beta functions should transform as a contravariant vector under duality. in

a quantum eld theory with duality, the existence - and the consistency - of the duality

symmetry should not depend on the renormalization of the model, so what (3.67) really

means is that the duality is a quantum symmetry of the quantum eld theory. the

relation in (3.67) was rst explicitly formulated in [72].

its consequences, and more

generally, the conditions on the rg ow from duality, have been investigated in many

dierent contexts and cases. we will list here a few important contributions: t -duality

(in the context of a bosonic sigma model at one-loop) was rst considered in the seminal

paper of haagensen [73]. this analysis was subsequently extended to two-loop in a

65

bosonic sigma model with purely metric background in [72] and [74].

in the rst of

these papers, it was shown that [t, r] = 0 continues to be valid at two-loop; in the

second paper it was shown that assuming [t, r] = 0 determines the form of the two-

loop beta function. the heterotic sigma models were considered at one-loop in [75].

after cancellation of anomalies it was found that the consistency conditions are exactly

satised.

damgaard and haagensen [76] studied spin systems with kramers-wannier symmetry.

in this case the duality group is z2 and the restrictions were not strong enough to

completely determine the rg ows. however, a similar consistency condition on the

beta function (k) implies that there must be a rst or higher order phase transition at

the self-dual point k = k .

quantum hall systems with sl(2, z) symmetry were studied by burgess and lutken

in [77]. here it was shown that requiring a certain symmetry to be commuting with

the rg ow (supplemented with some additional mild assumptions), were enough to

completely determine the c function - and in particular the rg beta function.

ritz [78] considered constraints on the rg ow in n = 2 su(2) supersymmetric
models, which exhibit an s-duality. assuming (supplemented with some additional mild

assumptions) that the rg ow commutes with a certain subgroup of sl(2, z)/z2, the

exact non-perturbative beta function could be determined. happily enough, the result

coincides with the seiberg-witten solution. similar work was done by latorre and lutken
[79], in which they also address the question of rg ow constraints in n = 0 gauge
theories.

more recent work by balog, forgacs, mohammedi, palla and schnittger [80] that gives

a proof of [t, r] = 0 at one-loop (for both abelian and non-abelian dualities) from rst

principles will be described in the last part of this chapter.

3.2 bosonic models at one-loop

in this section we will consider the restrictions on rg ow imposed by duality in bosonic

sigma models at one-loop. we will follow [72, 73].

the target space of the sigma model is taken to be d-dimensional. after going to

66

adapted coordinates as described in the previous section, the relevant action is

s =

1

4 z

d2 [g00(x)ax 0ax 0 + 2g0i(x)ax 0ax i + gij(x)ax iax j

+iab(2b0i(x)ax 0bx i + bijax ibx j)] ,

(3.69)

with all background elds independent of x 0 and i, j = 1, . . . , d  1. the corresponding
one-loop duality transformations can be found in (3.61).

for  a curved worldsheet, we must include another background coupling, namely

that of the dilaton (x) [66]. after renormalization this and the other couplings will ow

as encoded in the rg beta functions:

g
  

d
d

g , b

  

d
d

b ,   

d

 .

(3.70)

in studying the relation between duality and the rg ow we might as well use the weyl

anomaly coecients which for this model are [67]:

 + 2 + (w) ,
 + h

g
 = g
b
 + h 
 = b
 =  + ()2 + w .

 w + [l] ,

(3.71)

(3.72)

(3.73)

here l, w are target tensors depending on the metric and antisymmetric tensor. under
a target dieomorphism we have e.g. that the metric beta function change as g
 
g
 + (), which reects the fact that the beta functions are ambiguous. however,
quite the opposite is true for the weyl anomaly coecients: a target reparametrization is
accompanied by w  w, and in the end the weyl anomaly coecients are invariant
[67]. this also implies that for the backgrounds that we consider we can assume that the

target tensors w = l = 0, which we therefore will assume henceforth.

in the notation of the last section, the couplings gi are gi = {g, b, }. since we
study the rg ow as generated by the weyl anomaly coecients, the action of this ow

on any functional f [g, b, ] is given by

rf [g, b, ] =

f

g  g

 +

f

b  b

 +

while the action of the duality operation t is

t f [g, b, ] = f [g, b, ] .

67

f
   ,

(3.74)

(3.75)

in the previous section we postulated that the condition for the mutual consistency of

renormalization group ow and duality can be formulated as the requirement that the

rg ow and duality operations commute in parameter space:

[t, r] = 0 .

(3.76)

we will start by assuming that this is true at the one-loop order we are considering and

then see to what extend this determines the rg ow. later we will show  by simplifying

the resulting equations  that this condition is in fact satised at one-loop.

now, using the r operation on each side of the classical duality transformations in

(3.61), we see that this is equivalent to the following set of consistency conditions:

where on the left hand side we denote by e.g.  g

 the weyl anomaly coecient computed
as a functional of the dual geometry. these relations were rst presented in [73]. here

it was shown that the known beta functions satisfy the relations up to a target space

dieomorphism and that they are exactly satised for the weyl anomaly coecients.

if, on the other hand, we start by demanding that the consistency relations should be

satised, how much can be determined? these conditions are very restrictive and indeed

it was shown in [73] that they (essentially) determine the one-loop beta functions  to

precisely what extend will be clear later.

a simple argument shows that at loop order , the tensor structures t which can
appear in the beta functions must scale as t(g, b) = 1t(g, b), with  a constant.
this is because the  loop counterterm has  as a factor and we can express this as,

()
 (

1
 g) = 1t(g) ,

68

(3.78)

so that a scaling g  g of the metric is the same as scaling   1.

this implies that to order o(), i.e.  = 1, the only tensors which can possibly

appear are

g

b

 = (cid:16)a1 r + a2 hh 
 = (cid:16)a5 h(cid:17) ,

 + a3 gr + a4 ghh (cid:17) ,

(3.79)

since these scale as 0 under global scalings of the background elds, are generally co-
variant and have the correct symmetry under (  ). here, h is the exterior derivative
of the b-eld, h = 3[b], and the constants a1, . . . , a5 can be computed from one-

loop feynman diagrams using dimensional regularization; see for example [65]. it was,

however, shown in [73] that requiring [t, r] = 0 and choosing a1 = 1 uniquely deter-
mines a2 = 1/4, a5 = 1/2 and a3 = a4 = 0. note that the overall factor of the
beta function cannot be determined since the relation [t, r] = 0 is a linear relation at

this order. as was also shown in [73] the transformation of the dilaton under duality,
 =  1
this gives the remaining consistency condition for the dilaton beta function,

2 ln g00 can be determined from the consistency conditions (3.77) on g and b.

00 .

(3.80)

from this condition one can determine the dilaton beta function up to a global constant.

hence we see that requiring [t, r] = 0 at this one-loop order determines all beta functions

(but only up to a global factor):

(3.81)

(3.82)

(3.83)

a standard procedure for verifying the consistency conditions such as the ones which ap-

pear in (3.77) is to decompose the background elds (i.e. the metric and antisymmetric

tensor) into a form which singles out the direction (x 0) in which the duality transforma-

tion is performed. this is the kaluza-klein reduction where the metric is decomposed

69

as:

g = 


a

avi

avi gij + avivj




,

(3.84)

such that g00 = a, g0i = avi and gij = gij + avivj. with this procedure the antisymmetric
tensor components are b0i  wi and bij. in this representation, the duality transforma-
tions take the rather simple form a  1/a, vi  wi and bij  bij + wivj  wjvi. however,
the task of actually verifying the consistency conditions is still very lengthy and the

fact that the duality group is just z2 is rather obscured by the form of the consistency
condition in (3.77). 4

in [72] it was suggested that one should express these conditions in the tangent frame

of the target space where the z2 structure is evident. this tangent frame is determined
 ab = g, (a = 0,  with  = 1, . . . d  1), and a specic
by the local vielbeins, i.e. e a

the z2 symmetry is now easily seen: one uses (3.77) and express them in the tangent
frame through (3.86). we are going to illustrate this with two examples; the 00 and the

(3.90)

in this form the z2 duality covariance is now manifest. an obvious question is why the

consistency conditions have such a simple form when formulated in the tangent frame?

the task of verifying the consistency conditions (3.77) in the form (3.90) is now very

simple. at this point, one needs to express the geometrical tensors which appear in

the beta functions in the tangent frame; this has been done for the riemann tensor,

and contractions thereof, in appendix a. let us show by explicit calculations that the
consistency condition for the metric:  g

00, is satised. using the expressions in

00 =  g

claimed in eq. (3.62). while we did not gain much here by formulating the consistency
condition in the tangent frame, the other condition,  g

verify in the tangent frame; with the help of the expressions in the appendix a, we nd

finally, there is the question whether scale invariant models are mapped to dual

models which are also scale invariant. this is however, easily seen since the relation

corresponding to (3.90) between the beta functions is [72]:

where a =  1
so, if the original model has g
after performing a target dieomorphism generated by a.

a  ln g00 generates a target space dieomorphism, and (ab) = ab + ba.
ab = 0 then the same is true in the dual model 

ab = b

72

so far we have demonstrated that our relation [t, r] = 0 is satised at one-loop

order for the bosonic sigma model. however in string theory the natural restriction

from duality is that the eective action should be invariant under t -duality. it therefore

becomes natural to investigate further the relation between these two conditions.

the eective action

at any loop order the eective action should be such that the equations of motion are

identical to the requirement of vanishing weyl anomaly coecients. at one-loop order

the eective action is given by

s = z ddxge2(cid:20)r 

1
12

hh  + 4(cid:21) ,

(3.97)

where we have chosen the additive constant in the dilaton beta function to be c = 0 and

we are using string metric with conventions such that 22

0 = 1.

using the one-loop expressions for the beta functions (3.81) this eective action can

be written as

s = rv 

v
gi  i ,

(3.98)

where v = 2g exp(2)  which we will call the measure factor  and where the

dot implies a functional integration. our relation relating the rg ow and duality

states that [t, r] = 0, while the natural requirement from string theory is that the low

energy eective action should be invariant under duality (since duality should just be

a reformulation of the same theory). however, these two conditions are not equivalent

 which is maybe not so strange since in string theory we will not have any rg ow:

cancellation of the weyl anomaly requires that the weyl anomaly coecients vanish for

a consistent string theory.

first, [t, r] = 0 obviously does not imply that the low energy action is invariant

under duality, since using the above relation we have

t s = t (rv ) = r(t v ) = rv = s ,

(3.99)

only if the measure factor is duality invariant: t v = v . can we go the other way around,

that is, if both the eective action and the measure factor are invariant under duality:

73

t s = s and t v = v , can we then conclude that duality and rg commute [t, r] = 0?

using these two conditions we can only conclude that

[t, r]v = t (rv )  r(t v ) = t s  rv = 0 ,

(3.100)

which of course is not the same as [t, r] = 0 as an operator equation. this can also

be demonstrated by looking at the one-loop weyl anomaly coecients.

if we use the

standard duality transformations at one-loop then it is easy to see that they obey t v = v
together with t s = s, but if we change the rg ow by multiplying b
then duality and rg ow will no longer commute: [t, r] 6= 0.

 with two, say,

so, in conclusion, while the natural requirement in string theory is that the low energy

eective action is invariant, the natural condition in studying duality of sigma models is

that duality and rg ow commute (which must be the same as saying that duality is

a quantum symmetry). furthermore, these conditions are not equivalent: if we are able

to nd a duality transformation t that keeps the low energy action invariant at some

order in , then we cannot be sure that this t will obey [t, r] = 0. the main reason is

that the form of the action in (3.97) does not determine the weyl anomaly coecients
uniquely: while any term zi obeying zi  (v /gi) = 0 can be added to the beta function
without changing the form of the action, but with

i(g) + zi(g) =

gi
gj  ( j(g) + zj(g)) .

(3.101)

this is clearly not of the form in eq. (3.68) and the ow is therefore not covariant under

duality.

scheme (in)dependence

in the discussion we have implicitly been using the assumption that the low energy action
is given as s = (v /gi) i. this form of the action is only valid in a specic scheme and
has no invariant meaning (scheme ambiguity is here dened as being equivalent to the

possibility of having dierent eld redenitions). what is invariant, or at least expected

to be true in any scheme, is that the variation of the action with respect to a coupling gi

is linear in the weyl anomaly coecients

s
gi = gij  j ,

74

(3.102)

with gij invertible. then the equations of motion will imply that the weyl anomaly

coecients vanish (which is one way of dening what the low energy eective action

should be). however, even formulated this way, it is clear that t -duality invariance of

the eective action does not generally imply that the weyl anomaly coecients transform

covariantly. this is because gij is by construction such that equations of motion implies
vanishing weyl anomaly coecients; then one could imagine multiplying one i with 2

and gij with 1/2 and (3.102) would still be satised.

this conclusion, that invariance of the background eective action does not imply

[t, r] = 0 seems to be in conict with the claims made in [83].

in this paper the

bosonic, supersymmetric and heterotic sigma model eective action is studied at two-

loop order. a set of corrected duality transformations at this order is then found by

requiring t -duality invariance of the eective action. we would add that this set of

duality transformations is not guaranteed to satisfy [t, r] = 0, but we have not tried

explicitly to verify whether actually [t, r] does vanish or not.

before turning to the case of purely metric background at two-loop, we would like to

make a further comment about scheme independence.

one could enquire as to whether the relation [t, r] = 0 makes any sense independently

of eld redenitions. that is, if we imagine that we have one scheme with duality

transformations that keeps the low energy action invariant and satisfying [t, r] = 0, can

we then nd the duality transformations in any other scheme such that they preserve the

consistency condition and keeps the low energy action invariant?

this is in fact possible. as shown by haagensen [84] (to order o(2)) one can
explicitly construct the set of transformations keeping the eective action invariant in

any other scheme.

on this background, we turn now to the case of two-loop corrections.

3.3 bosonic models at two-loop

in this section we show that bosonic sigma models have a two-loop beta function which is
 where  is a constant which cannot be determined by the

of the form (2)

 = rr

analysis [74]. furthermore, it turns out that the classical t -duality transformations

75

gets modied at this order. this has also been discussed in [85, 86].

it is known [87] that the two-loop beta function is scheme independent using the stan-

dard set of subtraction schemes determined by minimal and nonminimal subtractions of

the one-loop divergent structure r. however, this is only [87] true if we consider purely

metric backgrounds, so in order not to complicate the discussion we will concentrate on

such backgrounds. that is we take

g = 


a

0

0 gij




,

(3.103)

and b = 0 which implies that the dual background is torsionless also. furthermore, we
dene ai  i ln a and qij  iaj + 1

2 aiaj.

for such a background one-loop t -duality transformations amounts to a  1/a while
gij is left unchanged. our relation [t, r] = 0 is satised at one-loop as elaborated upon

in the last section  so according to our general philosophy we only need to determine the

corrections to t such that this relation is also satised at two-loop. the resulting duality

transformations have been derived, using geometrical and duality arguments alone (i.e.

without using any feynman diagram calculations), in [74]:

ln a =  ln a + aiai ,
gij = gij = gij ,
 =  

ln a +


4

1
2

aiai ,

(3.104)

here  is an arbitrary constant which is left undetermined by the consistency conditions.

the transformation of the dilaton has been found by requiring that the measure factor

is invariant in order to have a duality invariant low energy action also.

this set of corrected duality transformations were rst derived by tseytlin [85], mo-

tivated by the fact that the classical (i.e. one-loop) duality transformations did not

keep the eective two-loop action invariant (he found  = 1/2). as a puzzle we should

add that in that paper tseytlin derived another set of duality transformations that keeps
the string eective action invariant - with the classical relation ln a =  ln a and gij not
invariant - but it turns out that [t, r] = 0 is not satised for these transformations.

however, this is of course not in contradiction with our general hypothesis that at any

order in  should t be such that it commutes with the rg ow.

76

using [t, r] = 0 on both sides of (3.104) we can as usual derive the consistency

conditions which are to be satised by the beta functions:

(3.105)

scaling arguments alone determine the maximal set of tensors which can appear as coun-
terterms at this loop order as follows. using that under g  g (with  a global
scaling-constant) the metric beta function must scale as t(g) = 1t(g) constrains

such possible counterterms to having the form

(2)
 = a1 r + a2 2r + a3 rr

 + a5 rr

 + a6 rr
+a4 rr
+a7 g2r + a8 gr2 + a9 grr
+a10 grr ,

(3.106)

(the total number of possible terms at this order is 18, but only ten of these are linearly

independent, which can be shown by using the rst and second bianchi identity  see

appendix b). by using that the one-loop weyl anomaly coecient satises the one-loop

consistency condition, one can prove [74] that the two-loop beta functions in the original

and dual backgrounds are related by

ij = (2)
(2)

ij 

1
4

a(ij)(akak) .

(3.107)

under the duality transformation  which at this order is just a  1/a  the possible
tensor structures can be decomposed into even and odd tensors:

(2)
ij = eij + oij ,

eij = eij ,

oij = oij .

using (3.107) we then arrive at the condition:

oij =

1
8

a(ij)(akak) .

77

(3.108)

(3.109)

we have to nd the linear combination  if there is any  of the ten tensors in (3.106)

which satisfy this relation. first, of course, we need to perform a kaluza-klein reduction

on these terms, which can be determined by the help of the expressions in appendix a:

as a linear combination of the remaining terms. hence, in conclusion we have shown that

. moreover, it is possible to verify that a term like o(4)



with the requirement of covariance of duality under the rg, the two-loop terms in the

beta function must be:

(2)
 = rr

 .

(3.112)

one should, however, keep in mind that the constant in front cannot be determined from

this simple background  the correct result is  = 1/2 [66, 67].

we now know that the (ij) component satises its consistency condition. what about

the (00) component? as it has been demonstrated in [72] the consistency condition for

the (00) component is also exactly satised, and we can conclude that [t, r] = 0 remains

true at this two-loop order for the bosonic sigma model.

furthermore, considering the bosonic sigma model on a at world sheet it is natural

to ask whether scale invariant models at this order are mapped to scale invariant models

under duality? by rephrasing the consistency conditions (3.105) for the weyl anomaly

coecients into conditions for the beta functions, this statement is readily found to hold
true also at o(2)[72].

3.4 supersymmetric sigma models

having treated the bosonic sigma models at one- and two-loop it becomes natural to ask

to what extend [t, r] = 0 holds true in the supersymmetric versions, which contrary to

the bosonic case describes consistent string theories. we start by describing the relevant

sigma models [57, 65].

79

the n = 1, 2 models
there is a simple procedure to construct supersymmetric sigma models from bosonic

ones. using complex coordinates on the worldsheet, the standard bosonic sigma model

(involving only metric and antisymmetric tensor) can be written as

s =

1

2 z d2zk(x)zx zx  ,

(3.113)

where k = g + b. a (1,1) supersymmetric model on the worldsheet is then con-

structed as follows. to the coordinates (z, z) we add two anticommuting complex coor-
dinates  and , with

then dene the superderivatives according to

2 = 2 = {, } = 0 .

d =  + z, d =  + z .

they are seen to satisfy

d2

 = z, d2

 = z, {d, d} = 0 .

(3.114)

(3.115)

(3.116)

it is well-known that a conformal transformation z  z is dened by the property
that z = (z /z)z ; likewise a superconformal transformation (z, )  (z, ) obeys
d = (d)d.

a superconformal invariant action can now be written as a simple generalization of

(3.113):

s =

1

2 z d2zd2k(x)dx dx  ,

(3.117)

where x  should be understood as a function of both bosonic and fermionic coordinates:
x  = x (z, z, , ). on the worldsheet, x  is a scalar supereld (it has no worldsheet

indices) and after a taylor expansion in  we can write it as

x (z, z, , ) = x  +  +   +  f  ,

(3.118)

where x  is a scalar,  and  are spinors and f  is an auxiliary bosonic eld. by

using this taylor expansion and performing the integral over the fermionic coordinates

80

(with r d2( ) = 1) one obtains [57]

1

s =

2 z d2zhk(x)zx zx   g(x)(dz + dz )

+

1
2

r(x)  (cid:21) ,

where we have dened the expressions,

dz = z + (
 + (
dz

 = z

(x) +

(x) 

1
2
1
2

h 

(x))zx  ,

h 

(x))zx   .

(3.119)

(3.120)

also, the auxiliary eld f has been integrated out.

clearly, the rst term in this action is just that of a standard bosonic sigma model.

what about spacetime supersymmetry? for general target manifold m the action (3.117)
describes a n = 1 supersymmetric model [65], as it is written in a manifestly supersym-
metric notation.

the existence of higher (n > 1) supersymmetry in the case of metric and torsion is
discussed in [88]. we now turn now to the case of purely metric backgrounds, that is

b = 0.

the condition for n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry has been derived by zumino [89]:
the sigma model has n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry if and only if the target space
m is a kahler manifold (a complex manifold is kahler if the metric is hermitian, that

is gij = gij = 0, and it is locally of the form gij = 
 zj k(z, z), where k(z, z) is a
zi
function called the kahler potential). the condition for n = 4 symmetry is that m is
hyper-kahler [90]; however for the rest of this section we will mainly concentrate on the
n = 1, 2 models.

rg flow

restricting to the case of torsionless backgrounds we only have the metric tensor beta
function to think about. let us start with n = 2 models. such models have a metric
beta function which is of the general form

ij = a1t (1)
g

ij + a2t (2)

ij + a3t (3)

ij + . . . ,

(3.121)

81

where t (i) is the i-loop counterterm. the form of the possible counterterms is  as in
the bosonic case  restricted by scaling arguments, but because of n = 2 supersymmetry
there is a further restriction on these terms. by zuminos theorem [89] the possible tensor

counterterms must be kahler at any given order (since the unrenormalized metric on

target space is gij + tij). a kahler tensor is a second rank tensor tij with vanishing

unmixed components, tij = tij and mixed components which are locally of the form

tij = ijs(z, z).

using the same scaling arguments as in the last section, at one-loop order the possible

counterterms are

g
ij = a1rij + b1gijr .

(3.122)

however, the term proportional to b1 is not a kahler tensor, as it does not have vanishing
torsion, so b1 must be identically zero. the ricci tensor rij = glkrijkl is actually a kahler
tensor; it satises

rij = rij = 0, rij = ij ln det g ,

(3.123)

and qualies therefore as a one-loop counterterm. it has been shown [61] that the one-
loop beta function is unchanged by the inclusion of fermions in the n = 2 model and is
therefore the same as for the bosonic sigma model,

(1)
ij = rij .

(3.124)

at two-loop order the possible counterterms are again restricted by the scaling ar-

guments. this will just give us the same ten counterterms as we had in the bosonic

case. we can repeat the analysis of two-loop beta functions that was carried out in the

bosonic case. demanding our basic relation [t, r] = 0, the only possible counterterm is
rr 

, or on a complex kahler manifold



kl m
(2)
ij = a2rikl mr
j

.

(3.125)

however, this is not a kahler tensor and therefore we conclude that a2  0. this result
is known from the literature [61]: all n = 2 sigma models have vanishing beta function
at two-loop and we therefore have essentially derived this result from the requirement of

consistency between rg ow and duality!

82

what about n = 1 models? at one-loop the n = 1 models have a beta function
which is proportional to the ricci tensor as in the n = 0, 2 models [61, 90]. this however
follows trivially from the n = 2 result: the only possible counterterms are as in (3.122).
now imagine that b1 6= 0. because of universality this must also be true when restricting
the target space to be kahler. but kahler geometry implies n = 2 supersymmetry and
therefore that b1 = 0, which is a contradiction.

the same argument can be carried out for the two-loop term: at two-loop the only

possible counterterm is rr 
, but this is not a kahler tensor when restricting to
kahler target spaces and can consequently not appear as a counterterm in the n = 1
models either.



in conclusion, using scaling arguments together with [t, r] = 0 we have been able to
prove that both n = 1, 2 supersymmetric sigma models have a vanishing beta function
at two-loop (note that we only considered the torsionless case). it is natural to ask what
happens for the n = 4 models. such models are known to be ultraviolet nite, that is,
their beta function is identically zero [91]. their target spaces are hyper-kahler manifolds

so it readily follows from our analysis that the two-loop term must vanish, as a hyper-

kahler manifold is in particular a kahler manifold. that also the one-loop term must

vanish seems to contradict universality, but of course this is not the case: a hyper-kahler

manifold has vanishing ricci tensor so there can be no one-loop beta function either.

therefore, we might ask if we can prove that all higher loop counterterms must

vanish for the n = 4 models starting with [t, r] = 0?

the heterotic sigma models

while the problem here is basically the same as before  namely to see to what extend

duality can determine the one-loop beta functions  there is a new ingredient in the

appearance of a target gauge eld. everything else being the same, we will concentrate

on this related gauge eld beta function. the sigma model relevant for the heterotic

string theories was described in [92].

the gauge eld in question, a i

 , is in the adjoint of the gauge group g, i.e. i =
1, . . . , dimg, which for the heterotic string is g = spin(32)/z2 or e8  e8 [93]. the

83

relevant sigma model action is [92, 94]:

)x )+

(3.126)

s =

where

h = b + b + b

and

f = a  a + [a, a] .

(3.127)

furthermore, the  are left-handed majorana-weyl fermions and the i are right-handed

majorana-weyl fermions.

we will denote by  the killing vector that generates the abelian isometry which

enables duality transformations.
invariance of the action requires a transformation of
the gauge eld: a  a = d, where  is a target gauge parameter [95, 96]. in
adapted coordinates (where   0) we have [95, 96]
d   + [a, ] = 0 .
the duality transformation of the gauge eld is [94, 96],

(3.128)

and

a0ij = 

1
g00

ij ,

aiij = aiij 

g0i + b0i

g00

ij ,

(3.129)

(3.130)

where we have dened ij  (  a)ij = (  a0)ij (the latter in adapted coordi-
nates). the corresponding one-loop duality transformations of the metric, antisymmetric

tensor and dilaton elds are as usual (and can in any case be found in (3.61) and (3.62)).

to study the relation between the renormalization group ow and the duality we need

as usual the beta functions (or better the weyl anomaly coecients). for the heterotic

sigma model, the weyl anomaly coecient is to one-loop order [97, 98]:

a
 = a

 + f

 + o(2) .

and the beta function is [65, 99]:

a
 =

(df +

f) + o(2) ,

84

(3.131)

(3.132)

with d the covariant derivative that includes both the gauge and metric connections,
that is df = f + [a, f]. the weyl anomaly coecients for the remaining
elds have been presented in (3.25), (3.26) and (3.27). the consistency conditions follows

from our basic equation

[t, r] = 0 ,

are these equations satised by and only by (3.132)? this can of course be checked by

brute force. to simplify the discussion we will restrict to a diagonal metric background

with no torsion, i.e.

g =   a

0

0

gij! ,

(3.136)

and we take b = 0. classical duality transformations will then guarantee that there

is no torsion in the dual background either, see eq. (3.61).

(3.137)

(3.138)

upon inserting the known beta functions, and doing the duality transformations, there

is, however, a small surprise since this is actually not the result that one nds. rather

the result is [75]:

(3.139)

(3.140)

for (3.137) to be consistent with (3.139)  or in order for duality to be a quantum

symmetry  we need to have:

(  a0) g

00 = 0 .

(3.141)

in the case of the most general background what this is saying is that ( a0) = 0. what
is the origin of such a condition?

85

the answer to this question is that because of anomalies the theory and its dual will

only be equivalent when certain conditions are met. such anomalies come from chiral

fermions which are part of the background elds.

the simplest way to cancel the anomalies is to assume that the spin connection and

gauge connection match, i.e.  = a [23, 94, 96]. that this is a consistent condition  in
the sense of duality  follows from the fact that if  = a then also  = a in the dual

theory [94, 96]. it then follows [94, 96] that  = , where we dene

 

1
2

(  ) ,

(3.142)

in adapted coordinates  = g0 and therefore  since the connection is metric compatible

 we have  = 0. this readily answers our question as to the origin of the condition

(3.141):

ij = (  a0)ij = 0 ,

(3.143)

because we demand that anomalies must cancel. what this is telling us is that in order

for the consistency condition, as applied to the gauge eld, to be satised requires the

cancellation of anomalies (the logic might seem reversed here since in order to have a

well dened renormalization group ow the theory should be free of anomalies; however

the attitude we are taking here is that we will see how far the requirement of [t, r] = 0

can take us).

so far we have shown that the consistency conditions (3.137) are satised by the weyl

anomaly coecients given in (3.131). but what we want is the other way around  do

the consistency conditions determine the renormalization group ow?

the gauge beta function is a covariant tensor (a vector) on the space of background

elds. together with the scaling arguments in [100] this determines that to one-loop

order it must be of the form

a
 = c1 df + c2 h

f ,

(3.144)

where c1 and c2 are constants that can be computed using one-loop feynman diagrams

as in [65, 99]. here, these constants are determined by the beta function constraint:

 a
i = a

i +

1
2

fi

kk ln a ,

86

(3.145)

which follows directly from taking the dual of eq. (3.131) and using that  a

i . for
torsionless background, however, the last term in (3.144) is absent and we can therefore

i = a

set c2 = 0. insertion of (3.144) in (3.145) then gives

(c1 

1
2

)fi

kk ln a = 0 ,

(3.146)

from which we obtain c1 = 1

2, which agrees with the result in eq. (3.132). we conclude
that we were able to uniquely determine the one-loop gauge eld beta function  though

in the particular case of vanishing torsion. considering the case of torsion included [75]
shows that also the constant c2 can be determined by (3.145). the result is c2 = 1

4, which

agrees with (3.132).

thus, the consistency conditions are veried by, and only by, the correct rg ows

of the heterotic sigma model. in other words, classical target space duality symmetry

survives as a valid quantum symmetry of the heterotic sigma model.

it is, however, not obvious how one should extend this analysis to higher (  2) loop
orders, since in this case the beta functions contain lorentz and gauge variant terms [99].

3.5 open questions

in this section we will address a few open questions which arise naturally in connection

with the situations analyzed in the preceding part of this chapter. in the last part of this

section we will describe how the relation [t, r] = 0 has been derived at one-loop [80].

open string

we have been analyzing the relation between renormalization group ow and duality for
bosonic, supersymmetric (with n = 1, 2) and the heterotic sigma models (which have
n = 1). it could be interesting to include the case of open (super)strings. in the open
string case, the duality transformations are [101],

a0 = 0

,

ai = ai .

the consistency conditions associated with these transformations,

 a
0 = 0

and

 a
i = a

i

,

87

(3.147)

(3.148)

are the same as for the heterotic string with vanishing anomaly. naively, scaling argu-

ments would then dictate that the only possible form of the gauge eld beta function is

that of eq. (3.144). however, this is not the whole story. the reason is that t -duality

 as discussed further in the next chapter  interchanges the usual neumann boundary

condition nx = 0 with the dirichlet condition  x = 0 in the dualized directions. this

implies that the ends of the open string are conned to move on d-branes and the po-

sition of this hyperplane f (x ) becomes a dynamical eld which should be included in

the rg ow. for further discussion see [101].

it could be interesting to include these boundary elds to study the rg ow of the

open string sigma model in the presence of d-branes. in some sense one would then have

to require [t, r] = 0 both in the bulk and on the boundary of the worldsheet surface.

maybe this could be important for nding a non-abelian version of the born-infeld action.

higher loop corrections

having shown that the two-loop beta functions must vanish for the supersymmetric
(n = 1, 2) models, it is natural to enquire as to what happens for higher loop orders.
the three-loop correction to the supersymmetric models is known to vanish [102], while

the four-loop correction is non-vanishing and very complicated indeed [102]. to perform

such an analysis we need to know how the beta functions dier from the weyl anomaly

coecients. there is a dierence at one-loop but no further terms at two-loop. however,

there are new terms appearing at three and higher loops, since in this case one cannot

set l = w = 0 [66].

another complication is that the number of counterterms restricted by scaling ar-

guments can be large  the maximal number of possible terms presumably grows ex-

ponentially with the number of loops. at three-loop the counterterm must scale as
t(g) = 2t(g) and the tensors can be described  in the case of no torsion  as (i)
tensors of the form r (2 terms), (ii) tensors like rr (13 terms), (iii) tensors
like rr (11 terms), (iv) tensors of the form rrr (16 terms) and nally (v) tensors
which are of the form g  (contractions) (16 terms). these tensors (which have not yet
been symmetrized) can be found in a paper by fulling et al. [103]. so just to verify that
the three-loop beta functions must vanish for n = 1, 2 models seems very complicated

88

from this point of view!

we will end this chapter by mentioning, that more recently balog et al. [80] has pre-

sented a derivation of (3.67) to one-loop order. following [80], let us write the worldsheet
metric as hab = e(z)ab. now let g denote collectively the set of renormalized couplings
(g, b, ) and g0 the bare couplings and let z r[g; ] denote the renormalized partition

function (z[g; ] is the corresponding bare partition function). the starting point is the

weyl anomaly coecients being dened through the anomalous ward identity:

z r
(z)

= ht a

a(z)i = hl( )i ,

(3.149)

(the meaning of the last expression is that the anomalous trace is given by the lagrangian
l with the weyl anomaly coecients (g) inserted instead of the background couplings,
see eq. (3.24)) and the invariance of the bare partition function under t -duality:

z[g; ] = z[g; ] .

(3.150)

using an innitesimal weyl transformation, (z)  (z) + (z), one derives

z[g0;  + ] = z[g0 +  b(g0); ] ,

(3.151)

where b(g0) are the bare weyl anomaly coecients:

b(g0) =

g0
g

(g) .

using t -duality of the partition function one nds 5

where

z[g0;  + ] = z[g0 + (g0); ] ,

(g0) = (g0 +  b(g0))  (g0) .

(3.152)

(3.153)

(3.154)

here we rst performed a weyl transformation, then a duality transformation. instead

performing the duality transformation before the weyl transformation one derives

z[g0;  + ] = z[g0 +  b(g0); ] .

(3.155)

5the duality transformation is denoted by g = (g).

89

comparing (3.153) with (3.155) then results in

(g0) = b(g0) ,

(3.156)

as (z) was arbitrary. formally this result is valid to all orders in perturbation theory,

but only to one-loop order is it true that bare and renormalized weyl coecients agree.

then at one-loop one nally derives that

(g)

g
g

= (g) .

(3.157)

this is the same as having [t, r] = 0. it would be interesting to generalize this result

to two, or even higher loop orders. a necessary condition for this relation to be true

has also been derived in the mentioned paper. here it is shown  at one-loop  that if

[t, r] = 0 then given a renormalization of the original theory, this will translate into a

consistent denition of renormalized couplings of the dual theory, meaning that the dual

couplings are a nite function of the original couplings. furthermore it is demonstrated

that [t, r] = 0 at one-loop for the su(2) wzw model and for certain models related by

poisson-lie t -duality. it would be interesting to study further the models with poisson-

lie t -duality since such models do not require an isometry of the target space for duality

to work.

chapter 4

string duality

in chapters 2 and 3 we have been considering some important dualities in eld theory,

and to a lesser extent, in string theory. however, it seems almost impossible to discuss

duality without saying something about the astonishing results obtained only recently

in string theory; to mention a few: the understanding of the importance of so-called

d-brane states and the connections between string theories and an eleven-dimensional

m-theory. another important motivation for discussing string duality is that the s-
duality in low energy n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory can be derived from
such results. this chapter will therefore serve as a survey in which we give an intentionally

short introduction to some non-perturbative dualities in string theory.

in the rst section we review some basic facts about the known perturbative super-

string theories in ten dimensions. we then turn to d-branes which are a key element in

establishing the non-perturbative connection between the various string theories. in the

following section we review how all ve of these theories can be connected by considering

their strong coupling limits. in the last section we mention some important relations to

eld theory dualities in four dimensions.

4.1 perturbative string theory

we start by describing some standard facts about superstring theory in ten dimensions.

most important for the following discussion is the massless r-r spectrum (which is

91

connected to d-branes) and the massless ns-ns spectrum (which plays a central role

in the sigma model formulation of string theory as described in chapter 3). useful

introductions to perturbative string theory can be found in [64, 63, 104].

it is known that there are ve consistent perturbative superstring theories in ten

dimensions. two of these theories, called the type iia and type iib theories, have
n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry. the three remaining theories have n = 1 spacetime
supersymmetry, namely the heterotic so(32) theory, the heterotic e8  e8 theory and
the type i theory. the latter is a theory of open strings, while all the other theories

describe closed strings.

the two type ii theories both have 32 supersymmetries in ten dimensions. in the

q1

 transforming under the 16 of so(10) and q2

type iia case, the supercharges are two majorana-weyl spinors of opposite chirality with
 the 16. this notation refers to the
fact that the 32-dimensional spinor representation in ten dimensions can be decomposed
as 32 = 16 + 16. the ns-ns sector of this theory consists of a graviton g, a dilaton

 and an antisymmetric tensor b (in form-language, this is denoted b2). the r-r

sector consists of a one-form c1 and a three-form c3. this theory is non-chiral and the

supercharges have opposite chirality.

the type iib theory has two supercharges, or majorana-weyl spinors, of the same

chirality, with both q1

 and q2

is the same as that of the type iia string:

 transforming under the 16 of so(10). the ns-ns sector
it contains a graviton, a dilaton and an

antisymmetric tensor. the r-r sector consists of a zero-form c0, a two-form c2 and a

four-form c4. the four-form has self-dual eld strength the meaning of which is that
f5 = dc4 = f5. this theory is chiral.1

the type i theory is obtained by gauging the worldsheet parity  (which interchanges

left and right movers) of the iib superstring. that is, from the type iib theory one only

keeps states with  = +1. to obtain a consistent theory one also adds open strings.

the massless bosonic spectrum then consists of a dilaton , a metric g and from the

r-r sector a two-form c2. also there are 496 gauge elds in the adjoint of so(32). the
resulting theory has n = 1 spacetime supersymmetry.

1in this chapter, bp will denote a p-form coming from the ns-ns sector with eld strength hp+1 =

dbp; a r-r p-form is denoted by cp and its eld strength is fp+1 = dcp.

92

finally, the two heterotic theories have 16 supersymmetries in ten dimensions, that
is n = 1 spacetime supersymmetry. the massless bosonic elds of both theories are a
metric g, a scalar dilaton  and a r-r two-form c2. in addition one of the theories
has 496 gauge elds in the adjoint of so(32), the other theory in the adjoint of e8  e8.
perturbatively, all these superstring theories have of course a sigma model formulation

as in (3.1) with ten x  embedding coordinates and various fermion and gauge eld terms.

4.2 d-branes

a central concept in the recent understanding of the various string dualities is that of a

d-brane (an excellent introduction can be found in the paper by polchinski [105]).

loosely speaking a d-brane, of spatial dimension p, can be described as a p-dimensional

hypersurface on which open strings can terminate, see g 4.1. topologically, the open

string worldsheet is that of a ribbon and therefore, we have to include boundary condi-

tions of the worldsheet elds at the end of the string.

these boundary conditions can be determined by the variation of the string action

(3.1) with respect to x :

s0 = 

1

2 z

d2x 2x +

1

2 z

d2x nx ,

(4.1)

with n the derivative normal to the boundary. the rst term vanishes by the equations

of motion and the second term gives the two possible boundary conditions (for the open
string we take 0    ), namely the neumann condition

or the dirichlet condition

nx |=0, = 0 ,

x |=0, = constant .

(4.2)

(4.3)

the latter condition breaks translational invariance. it is possible to disregard one of

these conditions, say the dirichlet boundary condition; this condition then naturally

appears after using t -duality. using (3.12) this is easily shown. introducing worldsheet
coordinates  =    and remembering that in the directions in which t -duality is

93

performed we have x m  x m = xl(+)  xr(), we nd
0 = nx m = +x m  x m

= +x m + x m

=  x m .

(4.4)

this shows that neumann boundary conditions have become dirichlet boundary condi-

tions for the dual coordinates x m.

figure 4.1: open strings attached to a d-brane.

in the case of superstrings the bosonic eld x  necessarily appear together with

fermionic elds . therefore, i.e. because of worldsheet supersymmetry, the boundary

conditions for x  should in principle be considered together with the boundary conditions

for . however we will not consider fermions here.

by denition an open string ending on a d-brane obeys the dirichlet boundary condi-

tion in the direction transverse to the d-brane; more precisely, if we have an open string

joined to a p brane at xp+1 = . . . = x25 = 0, the boundary condition for this string is (for

a bosonic string moving in 26 dimensions):

(n)

(d)

nx m = 0, m = 0, . . . , p

x i = const,

i = p + 1, . . . , 25 .

(4.5)

the dirichlet condition implies that the ends of the string are conned to move on the

brane. this makes it possible to have open strings stretched between two separated

d-branes.

94

a standard way to introduce d-branes is by use of t -duality (actually, it was this

way that they were originally discovered, see [60]). this is because t -duality interchanges

neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions. for example, in bosonic string theory, if
we start with a theory of open strings and t -dualize in the 25  p directions, we then
obtain a dp-brane as in eq. (4.5) (after taking the radius of the compact dimensions to

innity).

this also implies that t -duality connects d-branes of dierent dimensions.

if t -

duality is performed in a direction transverse to a dp-brane then this brane is transformed
into a d(p+1)-brane; if done in a longitudinal direction the brane is turned into a d(p1)-
brane.

where do such extended objects come from in string theory? here we should remem-

ber, that the spectrum of the dierent string theories contains p + 1 forms cp+1 coming

from the r-r sector. the type iia theory has forms with p = 0, 2, 4 and the type iib
with p = 1, 1, 3. consider now the integral
pzvp+1

cp+1 ,

(4.6)

where vp+1 is some surface with p spatial dimensions. by analogy to electromagnetism,

this is a natural coupling of the p + 1 form where p can be identied with the electric

charge. it is therefore tempting to conjecture that string theory contains various higher-

dimensional objects which couple electrically to the r-r elds. actually, in an important

paper, polchinski has identied such d-branes as bps states which carry the r-r charges

[6] (generally, the superstring p-brane congurations can be found as solutions of the low

energy eective supergravity theories, see [106]).

there is a simple but important consequence of this identication: in ten dimensions

a (p + 2)-form is poincare dual to a (8  p)-form:

 (dcp+1) = fp+2 = f8p = d c7p ,

(4.7)

where fp+2 is the eld strength of cp+1. an electrically charged dp-brane is therefore
dual to a magnetically charged d(6  p)-brane in ten dimensions which is charged
under c7p. for example, a d0-brane of type iia theory is dual to a d6-brane and
a d3-brane of type iib theory is self-dual. as in the introduction, one can  using

95

topological arguments alone  derive a charge quantization condition relating the electric

and the magnetic charges [105]:

6pp = 2n , n  z .

(4.8)

this relation turns out to be satised for n = 1 [105].

the tension of a d-brane can be calculated by a vacuum loop diagram of an open

string with each end on the same kind of d-brane. for a dp-brane (of spatial dimension

p) one nds [105]:

p =

2

g(42)(p+1)/2 ,

(4.9)

where g = e is the string coupling; the tension is normalized such that g = f /d1,

where f and d1 are the string and d1-brane tensions respectively. we therefore see

that a d-brane has the special property that its mass goes like 1/g, while a soliton mass

would vary like 1/g2. anyhow, the result is clearly non-perturbative.

it is interesting to consider what happens when we have many d-branes. if n d-

branes coincide, there will be new massless states since the mass of the strings stretching

between the branes is proportional to its length. this gives a total of n 2 states (since the

strings are oriented) which exactly agrees with the dimension of the adjoint representation

of u(n): in fact the gauge theory on the brane is a u(n) yang-mills theory [107]. for

n separated branes it would be a u(1)n theory.

the lagrangian of the worldvolume theory is that of n = 1 ten-dimensional yang-

mills theory,

s =

1
4g2

y m z d10x[ff  + fermions] ,

(4.10)

reduced to the (p + 1)-dimensional worldvolume of the p-brane. the yang-mills coupling

on a dp-brane is:

g2
y m =

1

(2)2p

= 2g(42)(p3)/2 ,

(4.11)

which can be derived from the fact that the gauge theory (4.10) is obtained by expanding

a born-infeld action to leading order, see e.g. [108].

such d-branes are not only important in lling out duality multiplets, but has also

played a central role in the problem of calculating the entropy of black holes by counting

96

microstates [109, 110] and has oered a completely new approach to certain eld theory

problems [111].

4.3 string dualities in d = 10

in this section we will consider the ve superstring theories and their strong coupling

limits. this will demonstrate that they are (or at least seem to be) all related as limits

of a single theory. maybe the most important of these results is that one of the limits of

this theory is eleven-dimensional. a number of reviews on non-perturbative string theory

and m-theory can be found in refs. [112, 113, 114].

but rst we consider the most basic duality in string theory, that is, the perturbative

duality relating the type ii theories: t -duality interchanges type iia and type iib

theories (so this is not really a duality in ten dimensions, but in nine dimensions).

t -duality of type ii theories

it is easy to see that the type iia and type iib theories are related by t -duality [59, 60].

for example, start with the type iia in ten dimensions and compactify the x 9 direction
on a circle of radius r. taking the r  0 limit is the same as taking the r   limit
in the dual coordinate (remember that r = /r under duality) with a right-moving

coordinate which is reected as in eq. (3.12):

in addition, the right-moving worldsheet fermion 9

r() must also be reected as

x 9
r () = x 9

r() .

(4.12)

9

this follows from the worldsheet supersymmetry of the type ii theories,

x  = i ,  = aax  .

(4.13)

(4.14)

with anticommuting parameter  and a the dirac matrices in two dimensions. the

transformation (4.13) changes the chirality of the right-moving ramond state and there-

fore the type iia theory is mapped to the type iib theory and vice versa. while this

97

establishes that the type iia and type iib are perturbatively equivalent in 9 dimen-

sions, one should check that the duality maps the non-perturbative objects of type iia

and type iib into each other, which of course can be done [7].

sl(2, z) duality of type iib

it has been conjectured that the type iib string theory is self-dual with a duality group

which is sl(2, z) [7, 115].

the conjectured strong coupling limit of the type iib string theory can be motivated

by looking at its low energy action. the ns-ns elds of the type iib theory are a

graviton, a dilaton and an antisymmetric two-form. the r-r elds are a zero-form, a
two-form and a four-form with selfdual eld strength (f5 = f5).

it is not possible to write a covariant action for the selfdual four-form  the standard

2 r f f with f = dc for f selfdual is s =  1

action s =  1
2 r d(c  f ), i.e.
the integrand is a total derivative and therefore the action does not imply the equations
of motion, which are d(f ) = 0. the low energy iib supergravity action does therefore
not have a term implying the f5 equation of motion, but this equation must be added as

2 r f 2 =  1

a constraint on the solutions, see [116].

omitting fermions, the iib supergravity action is a sum of three terms [117] (with

r-r elds and h3 scaled by a factor of 1/20):

siib = srr + sn sn s + scs ,

(4.15)

with

sn sn s =

(4.16)

where the denitions are such that f 

5 = f5 + c2  h3 with
hp+1 = dbp and fp+1 = dcp. this low-energy supergravity has an sl(2, r) symmetry
[116]. this can be demonstrated by using instead the einstein metric g, in terms of

while keeping all other background elds invariant.

note that the sl(2, r) mixes b2 with c2, that is ns-ns with r-r elds. since this

is a low energy symmetry the question is whether this symmetry survives in the full

quantum theory. hull and townsend conjectured [115] that the full type iib theory

99

is only invariant under sl(2, z), because of the existence of solitonic objects 2. let us

see what this symmetry group corresponds to. sl(2, z) can be generated by the two

transformations

and

  = 1/ ,

  =  + 1 .

setting c0 to zero, the rst of these transformations correspond to:

   , g  eg ,
b2  c2 , c2  b2 ,
c4  c4 .

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

since g = hei this is an s-duality that interchanges strong and weak coupling. also, it
interchanges the ns-ns two-form that couples to the fundamental string with the r-r

two-form that couples to the d1-brane of type iib string theory.

actually, the relative tensions of the d-string and the f-string is f 1/d1 = g. since

this is a consequence of the bps property of the d1-brane it must be an exact expression

and can therefore be extrapolated to strong coupling without any corrections. we then see

that at weak coupling the d-string is very heavy compared to the f-string and eectively

decouples from the spectrum. what happens at strong coupling? here the situation is

reversed, the d-string is light while the f-string is very heavy. so the natural assumption

is that in the theory at strong coupling the d-string changes role with the f-string (and

vice versa) and the string coupling is 1/g.

likewise, the    + 1 symmetry can be interpreted as a shift of the r-r zero form:

c0  c0 + 1 .

(4.26)

this keeps the eld strength f1 = dc0 invariant and is just a symmetry of the perturba-

tive string theory.

2more generally, let the symmetry group of the low energy supergravity in d dimensions be denoted

by g(r). hull and townsend have conjectured [115] that the duality group of the full string theory is

an integer form of this group, g(z). this group is called u -duality.

100

while the d-string and f-string are interchanged under the sl(2, z) duality it be-

comes natural to ask what happens with the other extended objects? under the transfor-

mation (4.25) the r-r four-form is invariant so it keeps the d3-brane invariant also. the
electrically charged d-string is dual to a magnetically charged d5-brane. the 6-form c6
that couples to this object can be obtained by poincare duality:

 dc2 = f3 = f7 = d c6 .

(4.27)

using sl(2, z)-duality this is transformed into a magnetic source for the ns-ns two-form.

this magnetic source is the so-called ns 5-brane. its tension, which can be derived from

the fact that one should have d1d5 = f 1n s5, is

n s5 =

1

25g23 ,

(4.28)

and therefore it is not a d-brane (which have a tension d  1/g), but a soliton which
have a tension n s  1/g2.

in conclusion, the conjecture is that the strong coupling limit of type iib theory is

again a type iib theory but with the d1 string playing the role of the fundamental string

and a string coupling g = 1/g.

type iia and m-theory

the most surprising of the string theory might be the type iia/m-theory duality: it is

conjectured that the strong coupling limit of the type iia theory is not a ten-dimensional

string theory, but rather an eleven-dimensional theory [7].

it has been known for a long time that eleven-dimensional supergravity can be related

to iia supergravity by dimensional reduction. to see how this works, we will only look

at the bosonic parts of the action. the eleven-dimensional supergravity has a three-form

potential b3; this naturally couples to a 2-brane and is poincare dual to a magnetically

charged 5-brane. the bosonic part of the eleven-dimensional supergravity is [118] (with
b3 scaled by a factor of 1/211):

s11 =

1
22

11 z d11xgr z " 1

2

h4  h4 +

11
32

b3  h4  h4# .

(4.29)

101

the dimensional reduction is performed by taking the eleventh direction x10 periodic,

x10  x10 + 2r .

(4.30)

the eleven-dimensional metric will then separate into g, g10 and g1010. this is a

metric, vector and scalar from the ten-dimensional point of view.

in ten-dimensional

string theory we only have one scalar, the dilaton , and it is therefore clear that string

coupling, which is determined by , and the radius of the eleventh dimension must be
related. it is convenient to dene g1010 = e2. now, decompose the eleven-dimensional

metric as

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn = gdxdx + e2(dx10 + adx)2 ,

(4.31)

and all background eld are taken to be independent of the compact direction x10. this

means that the momentum p10 is zero.

the three-form potential b3 will similarly result in a three-form in ten dimensions,

which we also call b3, and a two-form b2 coming from b10. by dimensionally reducing
in this way we get for the three terms in the action (4.29) 3:

s1 =

1
22
1
s2 = 
s3 = 

1

10 z d10xger 
2 z heh3  h3 + eh 
102 z b2  h4  h4 ,

2 z e3h2  h2 ,

4  h 

4i ,

(4.32)

where we have dened h 

4 = h4 +b1h3 and b1 = a1/210; b2,3 have been rescaled by

a factor (2r)1/2. the ten-dimensional gravitational coupling constant is related to the

eleven-dimensional by 2

11/2r. the bosonic elds of the ten-dimensional theory
are a metric, a scalar, two two-forms and a one-form. this coincides with the bosonic

10 = 2

content of the iia theory. to see how this works in more detail rescale the metric

(4.33)
3with the metric in (4.31) the eleven-dimensional ricci scalar becomes r(11) = r(10)  2e2e 
4 e2f f , where f = da. this can be shown for example with the help of the formulas (a.2) in
appendix a.

g  eg ,

1

102

and choose  = 2/3. then the action consisting of the sum of the three terms in (4.32)

can be written as (note that we have already identied it with the iia supergravity):

siia = sn sn s + srr + scs ,

(4.34)

where

sn sn s =

1
22
1
srr = 
scs = 

10 z d10xge2 [r + 4] 
2 z [f2  f2 + f 
102 z b2  f4  f4 ,

4  f 

4] ,

1

2 z e2h3  h3 ,

(4.35)

in terms of the new metric which we also denote by g (to obtain the rst integral in

the ns-ns part one can use the formula (3.36) from chapter 3).

it follows that the

iia supergravity can be obtained as a dimensional reduction of the eleven-dimensional

supergravity. it seems natural to ask what happens for the full type iia string theory?

this has been answered by witten [7] and townsend [119]. as in the type iib theory we

can learn important things by looking at the behaviour of the non-perturbative objects.

in the type iia theory the natural objects to look at are the d0-branes. these are the

objects that are electrically charged under c1. the tension of such a d0-brane is by (4.9):

do =

1

g1/2 .

(4.36)

this means that at weak coupling the d0-brane is very heavy and decouples while at

strong coupling it becomes very light. furthermore, it has been shown [120, 121] that for

n = 2 and n prime there is a bound state of n d0-branes at threshold. assuming this to

be true for any positive integer n, we get a bound state with mass

ndo =

n

g1/2 .

(4.37)

this is a bps state so this expression is exact and therefore can be used even at strong
coupling. at weak coupling, that is g  0, these masses diverge and this is the reason
why the states are not seen in the elementary string spectrum. at strong coupling

what happens is that these states become very light and form a continuum. could a

(perturbative) string theory have this kind of spectrum? possibly not, since there is

103

no other known string theory that has type iia supersymmetry in ten dimensions, but

the spectrum could originate from a kaluza-klein theory which has an innite tower of

excitations. consequently, it is natural to assume that at strong coupling, spacetime is
r10  s1 and not r10. the radius of the eleventh dimension must then be related to the
string coupling according to:

r = g1/2 .

(4.38)

this is the wanted relation between the radius of the compact dimension and the dilaton.

and a massless particle in eleven dimensions with one unit of kaluza-klein momentum

is interpreted as a d0-brane in the type iia theory. note that for this interpretation
to make sense, we must now include states with p10 6= 0 and not (as in the standard
dimensional reduction) only consider states with p10 = 0. this also makes it clear that

 without including the d0-branes in the description of type iia theory  this extra

dimension is not seen at all in perturbation theory.

it has been shown that the strong coupling limit of ten-dimensional iia supergravity

is eleven-dimensional supergravity. the iia supergravity is, on the other hand, the

low energy limit of type iia string theory. it is natural then to ask: what is eleven-

dimensional supergravity the low energy limit of? the answer (even though we do not

know it yet) has tentatively been called m-theory, where m could stand for mystery,

mother, membrane or matrix if you like. so m-theory is a hypothetical eleven-

dimensional consistent quantum theory, whose low-energy limit is eleven-dimensional

supergravity.

what is m-theory? we will not try to answer this question, but at least we can note

some basic facts. m-theory has a metric and more notably a three-form potential b3

which couples to an electrically charged 2-brane; this is called the m2-brane. the three-
form is poincare dual to a 6-form potential b6; the corresponding magnetically charged
object is a 5-brane and is called the m5-brane. furthermore, the theory is characterized

by one length scale, the eleven-dimensional planck length 11.

now we have a type iia theory which naturally lives in ten dimensions and m-theory

which is eleven-dimensional. compactifying m-theory on a circle and taking this circle

to be small we should obtain the type iia theory. this means that all perturbative and

non-perturbative objects in the type iia theory should be obtainable from m-theory.

104

let us see how this works out for a few interesting cases (see e.g.

[122] for further

discussion).

the d2-brane in type iia string theory is identied with an m2-brane which is

transverse to the compact dimension; it couples to b3 which originated form the three-

form in m-theory.

the fundamental iia string is identied with an m2-brane which is wrapped around

the compact direction. such an object is charged under b10 which in the ten-dimensional

theory was interpreted as the ns-ns two-form and therefore couples to the fundamental

string consistent with the assumption. the tension of a wrapped m2-brane is

f 1 = 2r10m 2 =

1
2 ,

(4.39)

because of the above-mentioned identication and using (4.38). this of course gives the

correct result.

the type iia theory fundamental string gives (like in the type iib theory) rise to

an ns 5-brane. this is interpreted as an m5-brane that is transverse to the compact

dimension. therefore their tensions must be equal,

with

n s5 = m 5 ,

n s5 =

1

(2)5g23 .

(4.40)

(4.41)

note that its tension goes like 1/g2 as it should for a soliton.

to conclude, while the type iib theory is self-dual, meaning that its strongly coupled

theory is again a type iib theory but with other couplings, the type iia theory has an

eleven-dimensional theory as its strong coupling limit. in detail m-theory compactied

on a s1 is type iia string theory. is there a similar result for the type iib theory? in
fact there is [123]. the idea is to compactify m-theory on a two-torus t2 with radii r10
and r9. keeping r10 xed and taking the limit r9   gives as just stated type iia
theory. because of t -duality this theory is t -dual to type iib theory compactied on
a circle of radius /r9. then, in the limit of r10  0, r9  0 with r10/r9 xed one
gets uncompactied type iib theory [112]. so the type iib theory can be understood

105

as m-theory compactied on a vanishing torus. in this picture the sl(2, z) duality

group of the type iib theory comes from the sl(2, z)-transformations of the t2 [124].

from the type ii theories we now turn to the heterotic and open string theories.

type i/ so(32) heterotic duality

the so(32) type i open string theory is conjecture to be dual to the heterotic so(32)

theory [7, 125]. this again can be motivated by looking at the respective low energy
actions. the low energy supergravity is in both cases n = 1 so it is maybe not that
surprising that a certain relation can interchange the two theories.

the bosonic part of the type i low energy action is [23]:

si = s1 + s2 ,

(4.42)

where

s1 =

1
22

s2 = 

10 z d10xge2 [r + 4] 
4 z d10xgef a

f a .

2 z e2f 

3  f 
3 ,

(4.43)

the rst term is readily constructed from the iib supergravity action by using that only

the metric, the dilaton and the two-form c2 survives the projection onto states with

 = +1. the last term is just the yang-mills action of the so(32) gauge eld with
f = da1 + ga2

1, where g is the yang-mills coupling. the denitions are such that

f 
3 = dc2

and 3 is the chern-simons form

3 = aa

the heterotic string, on the other hand, has a low energy action which is

can be mapped into each other by the transformations

gi  ehgh
i  h
f 
3i  h 
ai  ah .

3h

(4.47)

it seems natural to conjecture that the strong coupling limit of type i string theory
is heterotic so(32) theory, since the dilaton transforms as i = h and the string
couplings are accordingly related as gi = 1/gh.

the d1-brane of the open string theory is then identied with the fundamental string

in the heterotic theory [125]. the tension of this d-string is

d1 =

1

2gi

.

(4.48)

the d-string must be dual to a magnetically charged d5-brane. in the heterotic theory

this d5-brane is identied with a solitonic ns 5-brane [126].

so, the conjecture is that the strong coupling limit of so(32) heterotic string theory

is an open string theory  and we only miss considering the strongly coupled region of
the e8  e8 heterotic theory.

e8  e8 heterotic theory and m-theory on s1/z2
to determine the strong coupling behaviour of the e8  e8-theory [127] one uses the fact
that this theory is connected to the so(32) heterotic theory by t -duality [81].

to use this duality we start by compactifying the e8  e8 theory on a circle of radius
r9; including a wilson line in this direction will break this group to so(16)  so(16).
what is meant by this is that we assume that the gauge eld has a non-vanishing vacuum

expectation value in the compact direction. we therefore have that this is t -dual to the
so(32) theory broken to so(16) so(16) [81]. the relation between the couplings and
radii are then by (3.15):

g
r9

r

9 =


r9

, g =

107

.

(4.49)

the primed quantities are here referring to the so(32) theory. however, from previous

comments we know that this theory is related to the type i so(32) theory by s-duality

with

and (because of (4.47)):

gi =

1
g =

r9
g

,

ri =

r
9
g1/2 =

3/4

g1/2r1/2

9

.

(4.50)

(4.51)

the limit we are interested in is the decompactifying limit, r9  , with g large. it
is seen that the type i theory will be strongly coupled in this limit, but we need to

relate the original theory to a weakly coupled theory. a t -duality in the 9-direction

relates the type i theory to another theory which is usually called the type i theory
and can be viewed as type iia theory compactied on an interval s1/z2 [127]. since

t -duality interchanges neumann with dirichlet boundary conditions, the open strings in

this theory must have their ends stuck on d8-branes. it therefore turns out [112] that

the compact dimension becomes an interval of length r

9 with 8 d8-branes at each end.
now, the m-theory interpretation of this must be that the type i theory should be
identied with m-theory compactied on s1  s1/z2, with radii r10 and r
9. also,
the open strings of the type i theory are m2-branes which are wrapped around the s1

and stretching between the d8-branes.

in the end, this means that the strong coupling behaviour of the e8  e8 is controlled
by m-theory compactied on an interval. the group structure e8  e8 is here identied
with the gauge elds living on the two ends of the interval  that is on the d8-branes.

the upshot is that for every perturbative string theory in ten dimensions there is a

candidate for its strong coupling limit. this is usually illustrated as in g. 4.2, where ve

of the cusps represent weakly coupled string theories and one is m-theory. there are

two things to say about this picture. first of all the picture  as it comes from duality 

is conjectural. there are no proofs of these duality conjectures but only a number of

consistency checks. however, so far there seems to be no inconsistencies. secondly, it is

only certain regions of the moduli space which is covered by known theories  so there is

no fundamental denition of the theory behind all this (if it is unique).

figure 4.2: the moduli space of superstring theory.

m as in matrix?

one attempt in the direction of giving a non-perturbative denition of m-theory is the

matrix theory conjecture by banks, fischler, shenker and susskind [8] (and is reviewed

in [128, 129]). it states that m-theory in the so-called innite momentum frame (imf)

is described by a supersymmetric u(n) yang-mills theory in 1 + 0 dimensions.

in a

certain limit n can be identied with the number of d0-branes and should be taken to

innity. the imf is constructed as follows. start with a state of energy e in m-theory

and consider a boost in the eleventh direction such that p10 is large compared to any

other scale in the theory. the energy is in this limit accordingly:

e = qp2

10 + p2

 + m2 = p10 +

 + m2
p2
2p10

.

(4.52)

compactifying the theory  in the x10-direction  on a circle of radius r relates it to the

type iia theory with

e =

n
r

+

r(p2

 + m2)
2n

,

(4.53)

and the rst term on the right hand side is identied with the mass of n d0-brane, as

discussed earlier. the action describing the interaction of such n d0-branes is a u(n)

supersymmetric yang-mills theory (4.10) reduced to the worldvolume of the d0-brane

109

which is one-dimensional.

in this way one gets a u(n) quantum mechanics with an

action like

s =

1
4g2

y m z dt [2(d0x i)2 + ([x i, x j])2 + fermions] .

(4.54)

by dimensional reduction fij = [x i, x j] and f0j = d0x j = 0x j +[a0, x j] with x i nine
n  n matrices in the adjoint of u(n). when the commutator-term in (4.54) vanish,
these matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized and the diagonal elements are then

identied with the positions of the n d0-branes.

to obtain eleven-dimensional m-theory, we must take the limit r   and therefore

also n  .

this basically constitutes the denition of matrix theory. subsequently, matrix

theory has been compared with experiment. as an example, the scattering of two

gravitons has been computed to two-loop order (in the gauge coupling) in [130] and is

found to agree with calculations from supergravity. the same conclusion have recently

been shown to hold also in the case of three-graviton scattering [131].

it would of course be nice if this approach to m-theory could elucidate anything

interesting about four-dimensional theories. compactication of matrix theory gives

gauge theories in higher dimensions (compactifying d dimensions results in a (d + 1)-

dimensional gauge theory), but for d > 3 they turn out not to be renormalizable. so

the connection to four-dimensional eld theories seems problematic. as another related

problem we could mention that the large n limit of matrix theory is not very well

understood.

such problems make the matrix theory approach to m-theory less appealing.

it

might, however, be possible that further study of the relation between this approach and

the maldacena approach  to be described below  can lead to a better understanding of

certain aspects of matrix theory, e.g. of the large n limit.

m as in maldacena?

an  a priori  very dierent approach to m-theory is the recent maldacena conjecture

[1] (see [132] for an extensive review and references). by studying d-brane scattering

maldacena formulated a series of conjectures that relates type iib theory on anti-de

110

sitter spaces to conformal eld theories. as an example, with the geometry of n d3-
branes in type iib string theory, it is conjectured that type iib string theory on ads5
s5 is equivalent to n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills theory in 3 + 1 dimensions!
it is not obvious how a string theory in ten dimensions can be dual to a eld theory in

four dimensions. but at least it is easy to see that the bosonic symmetries match: the

conformal group in four dimensions is so(2, 4) and this is the same as the symmetry
group of ads5 (the global bosonic symmetry groups are so(2, 4)  so(6)).

subsequently, this conjecture has been made more precise [133] and in general terms

it states that m-theory compactied on adsd+1 is dual to a conformal eld theory on
the boundary sd of this space.

if, for example,  is a massless scalar eld in adsd+1 with boundary value 0, then it
couples to an operator o (of conformal dimension d) in the conformal eld theory such
that,

on the left hand side the partition function is computed in ads-space and is identied

zsu gra(|ads = 0) = her ddx0oicf t .

(4.55)

on the right hand side with a correlator in the boundary conformal eld theory.

as mentioned in the introduction, it has also been shown that this correspondence

satises an interesting holographic bound [9]: the bulk spacetime theory is described by

a boundary eld theory which has at the most one degree of freedom per planck area.

the ads-space appears because in the so-called near-horizon limit the geometry of

for example n d3-branes is [1]:

ds2 = "

u 2

gy m n 1/2 dx2

k +

gy m n 1/2

u 2

(du 2 + u 2d2

5)# ,

(4.56)

in which the rst two terms can be seen as a standard metric on ads5 (xk are coordinates
on the worldvolume of the d3-brane, u = r/ a radial coordinate, and d2

5 is a metric
on the unit ve-sphere). here the yang-mills coupling is related to the string coupling

through

and is related to the radius of the s5 according to

g = g2

y m ,

r


= (4g2

y m n)1/4 .

111

(4.57)

(4.58)

for supergravity to be valid the radius r should be large (so that curvatures are small)
compared to the string scale; that is, one must have gn  1. (in this sense the conjec-
tured correspondence is a form of strong-weak coupling duality). for xed g one should
therefore consider a limit n  , much as in matrix theory. but the interpretation of
these limits is of course very dierent in the two theories.

it should be noted that the maldacena conjecture not only gives an interesting ap-

proach to studying m-theory, but also to quantum eld theory. for example in certain

limits on one side of the correspondence one has supergravity compactied on ads-space

and on the other side a quantum eld theory. in this manner one can learn about strongly

coupled quantum eld theory in e.g. four dimensions by studying supergravity. but also

theories with even less supersymmetry can be studied. for example, it has been shown
[134] that four-dimensional n = 0 su(n) gauge theory has a dual formulation in terms
of m-theory on m7  s4, where m7 is a certain seven-dimensional manifold.

this would mean that the distinction between quantum eld theories and string/m-

theory might not be so fundamental after all.

4.4 some consequences of string duality in d = 4

we will end this chapter by mentioning two examples where the conjectured duality

relations between ten-dimensional string theories, and recent understanding of d-brane

physics, have been connected to four-dimensional physics. the main idea here being

that if we believe that the dualities relating the dierent string theories and m-theory

in ten dimensions are correct, their implications in lower dimensions can be inferred by

compactication.

first we look at the eld theory montonen-olive duality (which was mentioned in the

introduction) in four dimensions.

montonen-olive duality in d = 4

starting with the conjectured sl(2, z) duality of type iib theory, one can study its
consequences in lower dimensions. the montonen-olive duality of d = 4 n = 4 u(n)
gauge theory can for example be derived from the duality in ten dimensions [122, 135].

112

the basic idea is as follows. the type iib theory has d3-branes. the world volume
theory of n d3-branes in type iib theory is a d = 4 n = 4 u(n) gauge theory, since
reducing the n = 1 super yang-mills theory in ten dimensions to four dimensions gives
n = 4 supersymmetry [36]. the gauge coupling is related to the string coupling through
(4.11), or

g2
y m = 2g ,

(4.59)

where g is the string coupling and gy m the yang-mills gauge coupling. now, the sl(2, z)

symmetry of the type iib theory keeps the d3-brane invariant but changes the string
coupling as g  1/g, the last because of s-duality corresponding to the transformation
  1/ . then

g2
y m  42/g2

y m ,

(4.60)

which is the transformation of the yang-mills coupling under montonen-olive duality.
similarly, one can derive the shift of the vacuum angle    + 2 as coming from the
shift of the axion (that is the r-r eld c0) in the type iib theory.

thus, if sl(2, z)-duality of the iib string is correct it follows that the n = 4 super-
symmetric yang-mills theory in four dimensions has a montonen-olive duality. turning

the argument around, if we think that montonen-olive duality is correct something must

be right about the conjectured self-duality of the type iib theory.

this argument, however, is not very strong since there could be many dierent ways

to derive montonen-olive duality in four dimensions from string theory (see e.g. [136]

for another realization of montonen-olive duality).

seiberg-witten duality in d = 4

seiberg-witten duality has been identied as a consequence of duality of type ii theories
in [137]. introductions to the string theory construction of the n = 2 gauge theories can
be found in [138, 139].

in turning to the string theory realization of seiberg-witten theory, the rst question
that comes to mind is the following. in the seiberg-witten solution, the prepotential f
(in eq. (2.63)) is determined by the period integrals of a certain meromorphic one-form

 (2.65) on the basic cycles of the torus, or seiberg-witten curve,  (2.64). is there a

113

concrete physical meaning of this curve?

in one construction [111] of the n = 2 theory the answer is simply that in type iia
theory the worldvolume of a certain ve-brane is   r4 and that the n = 2 eective
eld theory comes from the low energy lagrangian of this ve-brane theory.

in order to construct a four-dimensional theory one can compactify type iia theory

on a six-dimensional calabi-yau manifold x3, which should be such that we get a theory
with n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions. for example, compactifying type iia
on t6 would give a theory of n = 8 supersymmetry.

more concretely, x3 is taken to be locally of the form p1  k3. here p1 is complex
one-dimensional projective space (topologically s2) and k3 is a compact complex kahler

manifold of real dimension four with vanishing rst chern class and h1,0 = 0 [141].

however, to preserve the calabi-yau condition, x3 cannot be globally a product manifold.
one says that k3 is bered over p1, where p1 is the base geometry.

in order to identify the four-dimensional n = 2 theory, one can start with the com-
pactication of type iia on a k3 manifold x2. the r-r three-form c3 in the type
iia theory gives rise to the vector multiplet aa as c3  aa  a, where a is a basis of
h 2(x2) [136]. charged elds are obtained by wrapping d2-branes on two-cycles sa
2 dual
to the two-forms a. these become identied with the w  massive gauge multiplets that

have masses proportional to the volume of the two-cycles s2 (wrapping four-branes on

four-cycles gives the corresponding magnetic duals).

to decouple gravity, that is to obtain a quantum eld theory, these cycles must
be vanishing. this is because in the decoupling limit one should take   0, while
keeping the w  boson masses  1/2 nite  it therefore turns out [136] that the
local geometry becomes singular. generally (that is for general gauge groups) the local

geometry is that of an ale (asymptotically locally euclidean) space with so-called ade

type singularities (see e.g. [141] for further discussion).

so the classical su(2) yang-mills theory is constructed by compactifying type iia

string theory on p1  k3 with local singular geometry.

however, in the seiberg-witten solution, the prepotential f has also an innite se-
ries of instanton corrections [138]. how does one determine these in the string theory

construction? one possibility is to use mirror symmetry [140] which will relate type iia

114

on x3 to type iib theory compactied on its mirror x3 and with kahler structure and
complex structure interchanged.

structure moduli.

the calabi-yau three-manifold can be characterized by kahler structure and complex
2 is a basis of h2(x3) and j is the kahler form 4, then ta =
j parametrizes the kahler moduli space. the complex structure moduli space is

if sa

parametrized by complex numbers zi; here, if si

3 is a basis of h3(x3) and  is the unique

2

rsa
three-form on x3, then zi = rsi

3

.

in the type iia theory the scalars of the vector multiplets (containing gauge elds

and gauginos) are determined by the kahler structure and those of the hyper multiplets

(containing matter elds) by the complex structure. in the type iib theory the situation

is reversed: the vector multiplet scalars are determined by the complex structure and the

hyper multiplets by the kahler structure.

the instanton corrections are so-called worldsheet instanton corrections  in the iia

theory they can be understood as coming from the wrapping of the string worldsheet

on the base manifold p1. since there is no neutral coupling between hypermultiplets
and vector multiplets in the n = 2 theory only vector multiplets are important for
determining these corrections.

so, in the type iib theory  where things are reversed  there are no worldsheet

instanton corrections to the vector multiplet. this implies [136] that the classical period

integrals r  in x3 describe the exact vector multiplet moduli space in the n = 2 theory.
the general solution to the n = 2 theory is, therefore, given in terms of period integrals
rsi

 on a local calabi-yau geometry in x3.
the period integrals of the meromorphic one-form  on the seiberg-witten curve 

3

can then be obtained by integrating out the two extra dimensions on a certain two-cycle

s2. in this way, one can get an explicit representation of the seiberg-witten curve (2.64)
as determined by the local geometry of the calabi-yau manifold x3 [137].

in this representation, one can also compute the stable bps spectrum in a rather

simple way  something which usually is quite hard from the quantum eld theory point

of view.

4in local complex coordinates the kahler form is j = igijdzi  dzj.

115

finally, let us mention, that there is a third representation of the n = 2 theory. this
is obtained by using a t -duality, which maps type iib in the neighbourhood of an a1

singularity of ale space to type iia on a symmetric ve-brane [139]. the worldvolume
of this ve-brane is   r4. compactifying the resulting theory on  gives a four-
dimensional n = 2 theory which is identied with the low energy eective theory of the
seiberg-witten solution [111].

having sketched how the seiberg-witten duality (which played an important role

in the topological eld theories studied in our rst chapter) in four dimensions follows

naturally from string duality in ten dimensions, we believe this is a natural place to end.

116

chapter 5

discussion

we have studied aspects of duality in various situations: in topological eld theory (as

the seiberg-witten duality), in eld theory (as the t -duality of sigma models) and in

string theory (where duality seems to connect all ve known theories in ten dimensions).

in testing dualities the topological eld theory approach seems to be an important

one. not only because topological eld theories are very simple but also because one

might hope that the results that follow from using the seiberg-witten invariants can be

proven in an exact way.

in this thesis we have shown that by dimensionally reducing the topological eld

theories corresponding to the two (dual) approaches to donaldson theory, one obtains

theories which by construction are topological, and we have derived the corresponding

monopole equations in three and two dimensions [19]. while the three-dimensional

versions have been studied quite extensively in the literature, there is still a gap to be

lled in the two-dimensional case. here one studies what are called the hitchin equations

on a riemann surface. the connection from duality in moduli space could in principle

be used to carry out an analysis from the point of view of the seiberg-witten theory. to

this end, the vanishing theorems we derived in two dimensions should be important.

even in the original four-dimensional eective n = 2 theory do such two-dimensional
in two-dimensional landau-ginzburg

topological eld theories appear to play a role.

models, the three-point correlators can be shown to obey the so-called wdvv (witten-

dijkgraaf-verlinde-verlinde) equations. as discussed in [142], the same equations have

117

been shown to hold for certain derivatives of the prepotential, which seem to indicate that

the low-energy eective theory contains a certain two-dimensional topological structure.

it is important to establish whether the two-dimensional topological eld theory ob-

tained by dimensionally reducing the monopole action is in any way connected to the

wdvv equations.

also, since everything is rather simple in two dimensions, one might speculate that

duality can be derived more directly. here the connection to string theory is also impor-

tant; it is quite likely that string theory will provide a new understanding of the relations

between invariants of various moduli spaces. hence, it would be interesting to study the

moduli problems from the point of view of non-perturbative string theory. this does not

seem an impossible task. it is well known that topological quantum eld theories (at
least those associated with n = 4 supersymmetry) can be obtained from d-branes in
string theory [143].

one might also speculate about getting interesting topological eld theory dualities

from the maldacena conjecture [1]. according to this conjecture, a conformal eld theory

in d dimensions is described by type iib string theory compactied on (d+1)-dimensional

anti-de sitter space (on the boundary of which the eld theory resides). twisting the

conformal eld theory, one should obtain a d-dimensional topological eld theory which is

dual to a certain string theory in d + 1 dimensions! could this be important for studying

the topology of four-manifolds? 1

we then studied some restrictions imposed by t -duality in two-dimensional sigma

models. the key result here is the relation, put forward by the author and p. haagensen,

that at any order in sigma model perturbation theory the rg ow (as denoted by the

operator r) commute with t -duality: [t, r] = 0 [72]. this has been veried to leading

order in   for bosonic, supersymmetric and heterotic sigma models [72, 73, 74]. the

validity has also been demonstrated to second order in  for bosonic models with a purely

metric background [72]. it seems natural to generalize this latter result to the case of

torsionful backgrounds even though there here is the further complication of scheme

1as a variant of the ads/cft correspondence, gopakumar and vafa have suggested recently [144]
that su (n ) chern simons theory on s3 is dual to a certain topological string theory (described by the

a-model topological sigma model mentioned in chapter 2).

118

dependence.

also, starting with [t, r] = 0, we have been able to essentially compute the one-loop

beta functions in these models, and the two-loop functions in the case of bosonic and

supersymmetric models with purely metric backgrounds [74].

recently balog et al. [80] have presented a derivation of [t, r] = 0 at one-loop order,

which explains (at least to one-loop order) why we have found the consistency conditions

studied in chapter 3 being exactly satised for the weyl anomaly coecients. this

work naturally calls for a generalization to higher-loop orders. in this way one should

be able to address the question of corrections to duality at two-loop order including the

antisymmetric tensor background [83].

it has also turned out that a requirement such as [t, r] = 0, with t some duality

symmetry, not only provides constraints on rg ow in sigma models but also in models

with s-duality and statistical systems [76, 78]. but in these cases it needs to be identied

what principles are needed to ask for commutativity between rg ow and dualities in

the rst place. in this context, we also propose to study further such relations between

duality and rg ow for the open string sigma models, here with the ingredient of d-

branes added.

finally, we have tried to give an outline of the present status of string theory duality

in ten dimensions. here it has turned out that all ten-dimensional theories are connected

in a manner such that the strong coupling limit of any of these ve theories has a cor-

responding naturally weakly coupled theory (many similar results have been obtained in

lower dimensions as is apparent from [7] and its citations). most surprising is the type

iia theory where one gets an eleven-dimensional theory, called m-theory (note that all

other theories can be obtained as certain limits of m-theory). while we do not know the

correct way to formulate m-theory or what the relevant degrees of freedom are, we do

know that in superstring theory d-branes play a central role in describing the dynamics at

strong coupling. hence, they seem to be important in nding the right way to formulate

string/m-theory. as such they have played an important role both in the formulation of

the matrix theory conjecture and in the more recent maldacena conjecture. and in the

latter case there is even the added bonus that one can make certain predictions about

quantum eld theories at strong coupling.

119

let us conclude by saying that duality still has not fully answered the more funda-

mental questions such as: what is eld theory?, what is string theory? or what is

m-theory?. but at least we seem to be on the way.

two-loop tensor structures

the possible tensor structures which can appear at two-loop are symmetric tensors and

must scale as 1 under global scalings of the background metric. a moment of thought
reveals that the structure of the terms can be only of the three following kinds: r,
rr or g(traces of the previous tensors). here the  indicates a ,  index or a
contracted index; r is the riemann tensor. the resulting tensors are:

 tensors of the form r:

r,2r, (r

) , (r

) , r 



 tensors of the form rr:

rr, rr

 tensors of the form g(traces):

here we have reduced from a larger set by using the known symmetries of the riemann

tensor. as described in the main text only 10 of these 18 tensors are linearly independent.

to show linear dependence between dierent tensors one uses the rst and second bianchi

124

identities and the expression for [,] acting on tensors. the rst bianchi identity
determines for example that
