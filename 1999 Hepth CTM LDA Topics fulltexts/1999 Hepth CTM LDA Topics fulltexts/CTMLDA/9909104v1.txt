abstract

the hidden e7(e6) structure has been conjectured for minimal
models m4,5(m6,7) perturbed by 1,2 in the context of conformal
eld theory(cft). motivated by this, we examine dilute a4,6 mod-
els, which are expected to be corresponding lattice models. ther-
modynamics of the equivalent one dimensional quantum system
is analyzed via the quantum transfer matrix approach. appropri-
ate auxiliary functions, related to kinks in the theory, play a role
in constructing functional relations among transfer matrices. we
successfully recover universal y  systems and thereby thermody-
namic bethe ansatz equations for e6,7 for a6,4 model, respectively.

1 introduction

the impact of perturbed conformal eld theory (cft) has many aspects
[1, 2]. in this communication we explore one of its predictions; the trin-
ity among minimal unitary cft theory mp,p+1, p = 3, 4, 6 perturbed by
1,2, lattice models o criticality, (ising model in a eld, tricritical ising
model o critical temperature and tricritical 3 state potts model) and di-
lute a3,4,6 models. many results have already been accumulated on the
equivalence in universality, especially for p = 3. [3]-[15]. the scaling expo-
nents of the dilute a3 model in periodic or open boundary conditions have
been evaluated analytically [9]-[14]. they agree with numerical results for
the ising model in a magnetic eld. masses for eight elementary excita-
tions of the dilute a3 model are found to be proportional to components of
the (largest) eigenvector of cartan matrix for e8[15, 13]. vertex operators
of a(2)
2 , which is the symmetry of the dilute a3 model at criticality, satisfy
a set of relations indicating hidden e8 structure [16].

especially, we like to call attention to thermodynamics of 1d system
related to the dilute a3 models in [17]. a set of solutions to the eigenvalue
problem of the 1d hamiltonian has been identied in exquisite string
forms [17, 18, 19]. nine of them are expected to contribute nontrivially
in the thermodynamic limit. this observation leads to a set of equation
(thermodynamic bethe ansatz , tba ) which determines the free energy.
remarkably, tba exhibits the underlying e8 structure [20].

in [21], we have attacked the same problem in a dierent setting. by
following general frameworks, one represents the free energy by the largest
eigenvalue of quantum transfer matrix (qtm) acting on a virtual space
[22] -[28]. we have managed to solve the (single) eigenvalue problem of
commuting qtm by introducing auxiliary functions related to fusions of
qtm [29, 31, 32]. (we will simply call them fusion qtms.) eight fusion
qtms are found to satisfy a closed set of functional relations related to
e8. a quantum analogue of the jacobi-trudi formula [33, 36], as well as
combinatorial aspects in terms of yangian analogue of young tableaux
[33, 34, 35, 36, 37] play a fundamental part in the proof of the relations.
nice analytic properties of fusion qtms allow to transform the functional
relations into coupled integral equations. the resultant thermodynamic
bethe ansatz (tba) equation yields a direct evaluation of free energy.
again it coincides with a hypothetical tba for e8 theory.

as promised in [21], we carry out this program for dilute a4 and
a6 models. a novel feature lies in the fact that a box of the young
tableaux is no longer fundamental constituent. this may be natural in
view of representation: the vector representation is no longer minimal. in
language of s-matrix theory, boxes present breathers, rather than kinks.
we conjecture an explicit forms for qtm related to these kinks. the inves-

2

tigation on these kink qtms reveals a connection between uq(a(2)
2 ) mod-
ules of symmetric tensors of the vector representation and uq(e6), uq(e7)
modules when q equals to proper root of unity. with help of this observa-
tion, closed sets closed functional relations among fusion qtms are also
found for dilute a4,6 models. quite parallel to the dilute a3 model, one
recovers tba expected for e6,7 theories[20].

the paper is organized as follows. as the subject may not be so familiar
to readers, we present a brief survey on the qtm approach, together with
the sketch of the idea of analytic bethe ansatz in section2. the dilute al
model is briey described in section3. the sl3 fusion structure of the model
is described in view of analytic bethe ansatz, yangian analogue of young
tableaux and quantum jacobi-trudi formula in section4. we concentrate
on the dilute a4 model in sections 5 and 6. the explicit form of qtm
related to kink is proposed in section 5. a yangian homomorphism
among y (e7) modules serves as a useful guide in search of the form. the
rest of qtms are dened and their functional relations are claried in
section 6. the result coincides with prediction in [54]. similar results for
the dilute a6 model are given in section 7. with piece of informations on
analyticity of these qtms, supported by numerics, the expected tbas
are recovered in section 8. we conclude the paper with a short summary
in section 9.

2 survey on the qtm approach

exact evaluation of physical quantities at nite temperatures poses serious
diculties even for integrable models. one has to go much beyond mere
diagonalization of a hamiltonian; summation over eigenspectra must be
performed.

the string hypothesis brought the rst breakthrough and success. it
postulates dominant solutions to the bethe ansatz equation (bae) in the
thermodynamic limit. in a sense, the method tackles the combinatorial
aspect of the problem directly.

2.1 qtm

the quantum transfer matrix (qtm) method takes a dierent route. it
utilizes the famous mapping between the hamiltonian hm of a 1d quan-
tum system and the row to row transfer matrix trt r(u) of the correspond-
ing 2d classical model [22] -[28]. in the present context, the latter is given
by

(trtr(u)){b}

{a} =

myj=1

bj
aj

u bj+1
aj+1

.

3

here the box represents the rsos weights and m is number of sites. see
appendix for explicit weights for the dilute al models. the parameter u
represents the anisotropy of the interactions between horizontal and ver-
tical directions, and is called the spectral parameter. the explicit relation
between hm and trt r(u) reads,

trt r(u)  trt r(0)(1 +

u
 hm + o(u2)).

 is the normalization parameter of the hamiltonian. the essential idea in
qtm approach is encoded in the following identity,

exp(hm ) = lim
= lim

t 
rt r(u)

n

(1 +

u
 hm )n|u/n
rt r(u = /n)(cid:1)n
:= (cid:16)trt r(u)(trt r(0))1(cid:17)n

n(cid:0)t 

.

thus the partition function of the original problem is transformed into that
of the 2d classical models on m  n site system. the ctitious dimen-
sion n is sometimes referred to as the trotter number. we can interpret
t 
rt r(u) as the row to row transfer matrix in the vertical direction. sim-
ilarly, one can construct a transfer matrix propagating in the horizontal
direction t 

qt m (u), which acts on n sites. thereby we have
qt m (u = /n)m .

tr exp(h) = lim

tr t 

n

the gap opens up between the largest and the second largest eigenvalues
of t 
qt m (u). in the thermodynamic limit m  , we only have to deal
with the largest eigenvalue of qtm. this strongly contrasts to the spectra
of t 
rt r(u). one observes almost degenerate low lying excitations in the
latter case as m  . the evaluation of free energy per site of the
1d quantum system is thus reduced to the largest eigenvalue problem of
t 
qt m (u). we are free from problem of summation.

this is, unfortunately, not the happy end of the story. the trotter
number should be sent innity at the end. the diagonalization of qtm
is accomplished by application of the bethe ansatz method. the bae
depends nontrivially on n, which originates from the local interaction
parameter u. thus we can not retort to the simple-mind application of the
usual scheme of converting the transcendental equation into the integral
equation. this makes the extrapolation n   quite nontrivial.

2.2

commuting qtm

instead of dealing with bae roots directly, we employ a dierent idea. the
integrable structure of the underlying model allows for the introduction

4

of one parameter family of commuting qtms which is labeled by a novel
complex parameter x. for the explicit demonstration of this, we adopt
more sophisticate approach than the one presented above[29, 30]. one
introduces a staggered manner qtm to avoid (trt r(0))1 factor in the
denition of t 

rt r(u).

as is emphasized above, we nd the intriguing fact, commutativity of

qtms,

[tqtm(u, x), tqtm(u, x)] = 0.

more generally, one can construct higher spin qtms by fusion pro-
cedure, tfusion(u, x). the yang baxter integrability also assures commu-
tativity among these generalized qtms.

[tfusion(u, x), tfusion(u, x)] = 0.

note that the factor u is in common. hereafter we will sometimes drop
this common factor in commuting qtms.

we now utilize the existence of complex x plane in which qtms are si-
multaneously diagonalizable. there exists functional relations among these
fusion qtms in the complex x plane. our idea is to utilize these functional
relations in the complex x plane in place of bae. see [48, 49] for the usual
row to row transfer matrices. our motivation is simple. the number of
roots is of order n, the trotter number. all these locations are changing
with n, while functional relations depends only weakly on n. the depen-
dence can be summarized in the known scalar factors in the functional
relations. one may expect the tractable limit n   for functional re-
lations. the problem of combinatorics (summation over eigenspectra ) is
then reduced to the study of functional relations 1 and analytic structures
of fusion qtms, as will be discussed soon below.

1 one can adopt dierent auxiliary functions from fusion hierarchy. results on other

choices of auxiliary functions for several models, see [30],[41]-[47]

2.3 analytic bethe ansatz and functional relations

the qtms should not possess singularities in x plane as boltzmann
weights are regular functions of x. bae can be interpreted as the polefree
condition of qtms in the complex x plane. conversely, the analyticity
requirement imposes restrictions on the explicit eigenvalues of qtms.

the idea of analytic bethe ansatz was proposed in [51], as a tool in
deriving expressions of eigenvalues of transfer matrices. it starts from a
simple observation; the eigenvalue at the vacuum sector is determined
by diagonal elements of r matrix, which are referred to as vacuum expec-
tation values. in general sectors, eigenvalues should be modied such that
each vacuum expectation value is dressed by appropriate combination
of baxters q operators. see eq.(3) for a typical example. the combination
is determined by requiring analytical properties of the transfer matrix. we
call resultant expression, dressed vacuum form (dvf).

a universal bae has been proposed in [51, 52]: one can write down
the bae for a model based on uq(g) using only algebraic data of uq(g).
starting from a properly chosen highest weight term, we can construct a
pole-free set of function under bae. in [35] a similarity has been pointed
out between the above procedure and the construction of the highest
weight module of a lie algebra. it leads to an assumption that there ex-
ists a set of function, polefree under bae, corresponding to an irreducible
module of a quantum ane lie algebra. the set is naturally identied
with the eigenvalue of a transfer matrix of which trace has been taken
over the irreducible module. this has been promoted as axiom in [35]
and subsequent papers [36, 37] producing fruitful results. we take sl2 as
the simplest example. by vm(x) (tm(x)), we mean m+1-dimensional sl2
modules, and the associated transfer matrix. dvf of t1(x) consists of two
terms. we do not specify their forms and represent by boxes with letters
1 and 2,

t1(x) = 1 x + 2 x.

each box carries spurious poles, which are actually canceled by bae. we
represent this situation graphically as,

1 x  2 x.

the eigenvalue of a fusion qtm can be apparently represented by sum
over products of boxes with dierent letters and spectral parameters. for
an example, one can construct a transfer matrix of which auxiliary space
acts on a symmetric subspace of v1 v1. we associate this the set of glued
boxes, i1 xi i2 x+i, (i1  i2). the dierence in the spectral parameters
are xed so as to match the singurality of r matrix. the cancellation of
suprious singularities is again depicted as

1 1  1 2  2 2 ,

6

where we omit spectral parameters. the eigenvalue of t2(x) is given by
the sum of three diagrams in the above. extention to general tm is now
obvious. starting from the highest weight term 1, 1,   , 1 we have a
cancellation diagram. one can easily identied it with crystal graph of m-
fold tensor of uq(sl2) representing the irreducible module. here we assume
the same 1:1 relation between the pole-free set and the irreducible module.
suppose that we have a short exact sequence among tensor products

of irreducible modules of quantum ane lie algebras,

0  w0  w1  w2  w3  w4  w5  0,

then functional relation follows,

0 = tw0tw1  tw2tw3 + tw4tw5.

remark spectral parameter dependencies are implicit in wis 2. the desired
functional relations are derived as a consequence of the relations among
ane modules. even if exact sequences are not available, one can still
check validity of hypothetical functional relations using explicit forms of
transfer matrices, which can be derived by applying analytic bethe ansatz.
indeed, functional relations for sl2 are easily derived without knowledge on
exact sequences . by using the above box-representation, one can derives
graphically, tm(x  i)tm(x + i) = gm(x) + tm1(x)tm+1(x), m = 1,   ,
where gm(x) is a known scalar function which depends on n. we will also
apply this for dilute a4,6 case in the present report.

2.4 functional relations and thermodynamic bethe

ansatz

unfortunately, functional relations alone do not provide enough informa-
tion on the explicit eigenvalues. this can be easily seen from the fact that
excited states eigenvalues satisfy same algebraic relations. one needs ad-
ditional information on analyticities of fusion qtms. let us agin demon-
strate this for the sl2 case. one conveniently rewrite them in terms of
ym(x) = tm1(x)tm+1(x)/gm(x);

ym(x  i)ym(x + i) = (1 + ym1(x))(1 + ym+1(x)).

(1)

consider functions in the largest eigenvalue sector of t1(x). we have con-
vincing numerical evidences for a conjecture that zeros of tm(x) approx-
imately lie on the curve x = (m + 1). then both sides of (1) are
2to be precise, we rst consider a vertex model of which quantum space (auxiliary
space) is given by wi and denote the transfer matrix by twi. later section we use same
notation for the transfer matrix of the corresponding rsos model

7

analytic, nonzero and asymptotically constant (anzc) within the strip
x  [1, 1]. (strictly speaking, we must modify the lhs for m = 1. we
will not go into such detail in this introductory part. )
this piece of information is now sucient to transform the algebraic
relations to integral equations which allow for explicit evaluation of ym
and then tm.

take the logarithmic derivatives of both sides and perform fourier
transformations. let dlym[k] be the fourier transformations of the loga-
rithmic derivative of ym(x). thanks to the anzc property, the cauchy
theorem applies. the resultant equation is simply given by

2 cosh k dlym[k] = dl(1 + ym1)[k] + dl(1 + ym+1)[k].(m  2)

remarkably, both sides only contain the functions with the same fourier
mode. dividing both sides by 2 cosh k, performing inverse fourier transfor-
mation and integrating once over x, we reach the integral equation, which
is identical to tba,

log ym(x) =z 



k(x  y) log(1 + ym1)(1 + ym+1)(y)dy.

(m  2)
(2)

k(x) denotes the fourier transform of 1/2 cosh k. though we have omitted
above, rhs of the equation (2) for m = 1 has nontrivial scalar factor
orginated from g function. it thus brings a n dependency, however,
in the combination un, approximately. remembering that u is inversely
proportional to n, we can send n   analytically! the resultant drive
term depends only on .
in this way, we take completely dierent route from string hypothesis
but reach the same conclusion. in the absence of appropriate conjecture
on dominant patterns of roots, our method has an explicit advantage in
attacking the problem. this is the case with dilute a4,6 models. 3 in the
rest of this paper, we shall extensively apply the above ideas to these
cases. we repeat the lessons from the above. to nd functional relations
is not enough. one must nd them having anzc property in apporopriate
domains in complex x plane. this is the most crucial step in the present
approach.

3 dilute al model

the dilute al model is proposed in [9, 10] as an elliptic extension of
the izergin-korepin model [38]. (see [39]for an elliptic extension of the

3although yet unpublished, there is also progress in view of string hypothesis for

these cases. the author thanks v.v. bazhanov and o. warnaar for information.

dierent type.) the model is of the restricted sos type with local variables
 {1, 2,   , l}. the variables {a, b} on neighboring sites should satisfy
adjacency condition, |a  b|  1. the solvable weights contain parameter
u, q and . we supplement their explicit forms in the appendix. the model
exhibits four dierent physical regimes depending on parameters,

4(l+1) , l  2
4(l+1) , l  3

 regime 1. 0 < u < 3,  = l
 regime 2. 0 < u < 3,  = (l+2)
 regime 3. 3  
 regime 4. 3  

 < u < 0,  = l

 < u < 0,  = (l+2)

4(l+1) , l  3
4(l+1) , l  2

we are interested in regimes 2 and 3. as in section2, one denes the
hamiltonian of associated 1d quantum chain by

h = 


u

ln trtr(u)|u=0

as in [17].  = 1, (1) corresponds to regimes 2 (3), respectively.
the one particle excitations for dilute al case has been examined in
[40] for l =3,4 and 6. (see also [15] for another derivation for l = 3)
eight, seven and six particles are identied respectively, and their masses
are summarized by a single formula in trigonometric limit,

where g is 30, 18, 12 for l =3,4, 6 and they are nothing but dual coxeter
number for e8, e7 and e6. we present sets of allowed as in table 1,2 for
l =4, 6, which are of our current interest.

numbers, which are just indices up to the present, will be connected to
indices for nodes in dynkin diagram of e7 and e6.

4 sl3 fusion structure and quantum jacobi

trudi formula

the sl3 type fusion structure in the dilute al model has been discussed
in [50]. this comes from the singularity of the rsos weights at u =
3; the face operator becomes a projector at these points. one picks up
desired subspace from tensor products of spaces using these projectors.
the adjacency conditions of local states are described by combinatorics of
tableaux.

we are interested in eigenvalues of fusion qtms. then the most rel-
evant is the fact that these eigenvalues are again expressible in terms of
young tableaux depending on spectral parameters, as exemplied in
section2.3 for the sl2 case.

as in section 2, we represent these three terms in by three boxes with

letter 1,2 and 3.

t1(u, x) = 1 x + 2 x + 3 x.

(5)

one infers from the sl2 example that a combinatorial aspect may also
appears. this turns out to be true. the eigenvalues of fusion qtms are
given by the sum of combinations of boxes, which can be identied with
semi-standard young tableaux (sst) for sl3. on each diagram, the spec-
tral parameter changes +2i from left to right and 2i from top to the
bottom. (fig 2).

we restrict ourselves to rectangular shapes for a while. firstly we note
that the qtms from 2  m ( 3  m) young tableaux can be reduced to
those from 1  m (or just scalars). this is due to identities,

second, the eigenvalues of 1  m fusion qtms have the duality in the
following sense. let us denote a renormalized 1m fusion qtms by tm(x);

tm(x) =

1

fm(x) xi1i2im

i1

i2

  

i3

the spectral parameters are assigned v  i(m  1)   v + i(m  1) from
left to right. the renormalization factor, common factor to all expressions
of length m tableaux, is given by

fm(x) :=

m1yj=1

(x  i(

2m  1

2

 j)).

hereafter we sometimes denote f (x  iy) := f (x + iy)f (x  iy).
we have a periodicity due to boltzmann weights;

the resultant tms are all degree 2n w.r.t. h[v + shift ]. obviously,

tm(x +

10
3

i) = tm(x),

(tm(x +

14
4

i) = tm(x))

for dilute a4 (a6) model. from the sl3 structure, together with the above
property, one can prove the following functional relations,

tm(x  i)tm(x + i) = gm(x)tm(x) + tm+1(x)tm1(x), m  1

gm(x) = (x  i(m + 3/2)),
t1(x)
t0(x)

:= 0
:= f2(x).

(6)

the periodicity for the a4 model , (x + 10/3i) = (x), leads to
gm+10(x) = gm(x) m  0 and g7m(x) = gm(x), (0  m  7). from
the adjacency matrix, one concludes t8,9(x) = 0. thus one deduces the
duality relations,

tm(x) = t7m(x), m = 0,   , 7

(7)

12

and tm+10(x) = tm(x), m  1 for the solutions to eq.(6). we verify this
numerically. these duality relations also hold for a6 models with change
in periods. see section7.

functional relations among them, however, do not possess desired an-
alytical property, as discussed in [21]. we thus introduce other class of
qtms related to skew young diagrams.

let  and  be a pair of young tableaux satisfying i  i,i. we
subtract a diagram  from . we call the result a skew young diagram
 , consisted of (1 1, 2 2,   ) boxes. in the theory of symmetric

figure 3: an example of a skew young table, (4,4)-(2)

polynomials, the jacobi-trudi formula tells that a complex schur function
associated to a skew young diagram can be expressed by a determinant
of a matrix, of which elements are given by elementary schur functions
associate to one-row diagrams or  one-column ones. the quite parallel
formula holds for the present situation, which we call quantum jacobi-
trudi formula [33, 35, 36].

consider a set of semi-standard skew young tableaux of the shape
  . we assign an expression to each table. the spectral parameter of
the top-left box is xed to v + i(

one identies each box in a table with an expression under the rule

constituting boxes yields the desired expression for the tableau.

of section 5 and the caption of fig2 in [21].

the proof is quite similar to those for young tableaux[35, 36]. one
must only keep in mind that the allowed positions of a box is restricted
by its spectral parameter.

the crucial fact is that the so dened t/(x) is an analytic function of
v due to bae, and contains t1(x) as a special case. the former is not so
obvious from the original denition by the tableaux, but it follows trivially
from the quantum jacobi-trudi formula.

in the same spirit, we introduce /(x), which is analytic under bae,

from t/(x) by putting tm8(x) = 0 in the latter,

/(x) := t/(x)/.{tm8(x) = 0}

for the dilute a4 model. the pole-free property of /(x) is obvious from
(8). for the dilute a6 model, we dene /(x) by setting tm11(x) = 0.

5 kink transfer matrix

in following few sections, we restrict our discussion to the dilute a4 model.
we will summarize the results for the dilute a6 model in section 7.

for e8 case, the vector representation is minimal and all other repre-
sentation has been constructed by fusions of it. eigenvalues of associated
transfer matrices in the dilute a3 model are thus derived from products
of t1(x + some shift).

this is no longer true for the dilute a4 model. let wa(x) be the yan-
gian highest weight module associated to the node a in figure(1). through
several evidences, we identify t1(x) of the model with the transfer matrix
connected to w1(x), which is not minimal. the most fundamental object
in e7 is w6(x) rather than w1(x). any other object may be constructed
from t (6)(x), the transfer matrix of w6(x), of which explicit form is not
known from the dilute a4 model. the determination of explicit form of
t (6)(x) is thus vital in the present approach. for this purpose, homo-
morphisms of uq(g) modules deserve attentions. they lead to non-trivial
algeraic relations among t (6)(x) and other qtms. although such infor-
mation is not available for uq( e7), there exits a list of homomorphisms of
y (e7) modules in [53],

as explicit rsos weights are not yet derived, it may not appropri-
ate to call t (6)(x) as the eigenvalue of transfer matrix. in the following
discussion, however, we do not use the assumption that it coincides with
true eigenvalue of transfer matrix of w6. rather, we simply use facts (1)
it is pole free under bae (2) it satises the desired relations expected
from eqs. 10 and 11. readers should understand this terminology just as
nickname.

the following functional relations between t (6)(x) and tm(x) will fa-

cilitate discussions in later sections.

proof: eqs.(15) and (16) are directly shown by comparing explicit dvfs
of both sides. similarly, through explicit dvfs, we check that lhs of eq.(18)
equals to 1/2(t2(x) + t5(x)) + t0(x + i 10
6 ). as t2(x) = t5(x) it coincides
with rhs. eq.(14) follows from this by x  x + i 10
6 . rests can be proven
in the same manner.

these relations suggest the underlying homomorphism between uq( e7)

6 fusion quantum transfer matrices and

t system for the dilute a4 model

having dened kink qtm t (6), we are in position to introduce other
qtms and explore functional relations among them.

first we present qtms dened by skew young tableaux.

(19)

(21)

(22)

one can equivalently rewrite (20) and (21) in terms of (6,6)/(5) or

16

(6,6,1)/(5)(x) using the relations,

(6,6)/(5)(x) = (6,1)(x + 5i)

(6,6,1)/(5)(x) = (11,6,6)/(5,5)(x).

these are outcome of the quantum jacobi-trudi formula and duality (7).
t (6) comes into the expressions of remaining qtms. the yangian ho-
momorphisms turn out to be useful in deriving their explicit form. we
take t (4)(x), related to w4(x), as an example. as argued in section 2.3,
we identify an analytic set to an ane irreducible module. thus eq. (9)
for a = 2 implies,

t (5)(x  i/6)t (6)(x + i/3)  t (4)(x) + t (x).

that is, dvf of t (5)(x i/6)t (6)(x + i/3) decomposes into two (or more)
subsets and each subset is analytic within itself. we looked at the explicit
dvf of lhs and nd that it contains analytic subset given by (x+ 4
3i)(x
i)t (6)(x  i
3). the sum of remaining term must be analytic under bae
and we identify them as t (4)(x). in a similar way, we deduce t (7)(x).

note that eq.(31) has already been proven in eq.(14) by the denition

(22).

these coincide with t system for e7 proposed in [54] in a dierent

context.
proof of eqs.(26) and (27).
these relations follow almost directly from denitions. consider the sim-
pler case (26). we consider the decomposition of product of t1(x 
6i)t6(x+ i). quite similar to the combinatorics of semi-standard tableaux,
we have

t1(x  6i)t6(x + i) = (6,1)(x) + t0(x)t0(x  5i),

which can also be veried from the quantum jacobi-trudi formula. by
utilizing duality t6(x) = t1(x) and periodicity , one recovers eq.(26)
after the shift x  x 5
6i in both sides. eq. (27) also follows by considering
the decomposition of (6,6)/(5)(x)(6,1)(x + 12i). see fig. 5.

proof of eq.(30).

this relation is less trivial. the proof utilizes (14) as follows. consider

the product t (4)(x)t (6)(x). substituting denitions (23) we have

i
i)t (6)(x)t (6)(x
t (4)(x)t (6)(x) = t (5)(x

one applies the rule (14) of product of two t (6) by shifting x  i/6. the

proof of lemma 2. the relation (33) is checked by comparing dvfs of

using eq.(14),

t0(x  i)t1(x + 3i)t3(x  i) + t0(x  i)t0(x + 2i)t4(x)(cid:17).

proof of lemma 4. for the convenience, we go back to the original deni-
tion of t (11, 11, 6, 6)/(10, 5, 5)(x). thanks to the semi-standard condition,
it decomposed into pieces. we consequently have

=

figure 6: decomposition of the skew diagram (11,11,6,6)/(10,5,5).

f6(x + 6i)f6(x  8i)t(11,11,6,6)/(10,5,5)(x) =
f2(x  i)
t5(x  9i)(cid:16)t5(x + 5i)t1(x + 13i)  t0(x + 12i)t6(x + 8i)(cid:17).

f5(x  i)f5(x  9i)f5(x + 7i)

(35)

on the other hand, the quantum jacobi-trudi formula relates the same
quantity to

f6(x + 6i)f6(x  8i)(11,11,6,6)/(10,5,5)(x)
+f13(x  i)t1(x + 13i)t13(x  i)  f14(x)t14(x).

(36)

then the equality (35)=(36) with properties tm+10(x) = tm(x) and
t7m(x) = tm(x) lead to lemma 4 after renormalization.

proof of lemma 5. although the complex conjugate property of t (4)(x)
is not obvious from its dvf, it can be shown from the established relation
(30) with the help of apparent conjugate property of t (5)(x) and t (6)(x).
then, replacing t (4)(x) by t (4)(x), we rewrite lhs in terms of t (6)(x),

be done in a graphic manner as shown in fig (7), or by the formula (8),

7 t system for dilute a6 model

we rstly comment on the duality property in dilute a6 model,

tm(x) = t11m(x),

m = 0,   , 11

and t12(x) = t13(x) = 0.

yangian representation theory asserts that irreducible modules of
y (e6) are made by tensoring minimal objects, w1(x) and w5(x). on
the other hand, we assume

t1(x) = t (6)(x)

as a qtm for w6(x). tus the situation is similar to e7 case: one must gure
out eigenvalues of qtms associated to w1(x) and w5(x) independently
from the knowledge of dilute a6 model. we conjecture that eigenvalues of
qtms for these two are same and its explicit form reads,

t (1)(x) = t (5)(x)

then new sets of functional relations (y  system) follow from the
tsystems.
theorem 2 functional relations among y  functions exhibit the e6,7
structure in the following form,

y (a)(x  i)y (a)(x + i) =yba

(1 + y (b)(x)),

a = 1,   , amax.

here amax = 6(7) for dilute a6 (a4 ) model, respectively. we denote a  b
if a and b are adjacent nodes in the e6(e7) dynkin diagram.

this coincides with the e6,7 case of the universal y  system in [55].
the derivation of the tba equation from y  system needs some infor-
mation on the analytic structures of y (a)(x), 1 + y (a)(x). only y  system
with nice analytic properties in the following sense yields an explicit al-
gorithm in the evaluation of free energy. otherwise, algebraic equations
alone are not of use.

25

we employ numerical calculations for some xed values of n and  for
this purpose. this is relatively facile as one has only to deal with the largest
eigenvalue sector. though we have perfomed numerical calculations for
small values of n, it already reveals intriguing patterns for zeros of t (a)(x),
which are also observed for the dilute a3 model. namely, imaginary parts
of coordinates of zeros have the remarkable coincidence with the exponents
related to mass spectra in table 1. we state it as a conjecture for arbitrary
n.

6 (aj + 1) for a4 model and  1

conjecture 1 zeros of t (a) distribute along approximately on the lines,
x   1
4(aj + 1) for a6 . the set {aj} agrees
with {a} for the particle j in table 1 (table2).
therefore, we have a lemma parallel to the dilute a3 case,

lemma 6 assume that the above conjecture is valid. then gy (a)(x) and
1 + y (a)(x) are analytic, nonzero and have constant asymptotic behavior
(anzc) in strips x  [1, 1], [0+, 0+], respectively.
where gy (a)(x) is dened by
gy (a)(x) =


y (1)(x)/{(x + i(1 + u))(x  i(1 + u))},
y (1)(x)(x + i(1  u))(x  i(1  u)),
y (a)(x),

for the dilute a4 (a6) model. here u = 6u(4u). the renormalization factor
is given by

for a = 1(6), u < 0
for a = 1(6), u > 0
otherwise

(x) =(cid:16) 1(iv/4,  )

2(iv/4,  )(cid:17)n/2

.

where   = 5 ( 7

2 ) for the dilute a4 (a6) model.

the signicance of the above property is clear when one considers
these relations (to be precise, logarithmic derivatives of them) in fourier
space, or k space. cauchys theorem assures that all quantities satisfy
algebraic equations at same k , i.e., without mixing of modes. thus they
can be solved in an elementary way. we omit the explicit procedure, for it
has been given for other models [31, 32, 21]. the resultant coupled integral
equations read

s(x) =

lny (a)(x) = a,tes(x) + ca,b  ln(1 + y (b))(x),
ca,b(x) = s(x)(2i  c g)a,b,

where t = 1(6),e = 12(8), and c g denotes the cartan matrix for

e7(e6).  also depends on whether we are dealing with e7 or e6 through

26

 = 2/(2 ) and kn = n. we also adopt the abbreviation, a  b :=
r 2 /
2 / a(x  x)b(x)dx.
2 [20].
the free energy is expressed via y  functions with the aid of eq.(26).

this is nothing but the conjectured tba for e6,7 rsos model at level

we shall only give the result for  = 1.

9 conclusion

we have seen e6,7,8 structure appears in dilute a6,4,3 models: exponents of
mass scale , zeros of qtms and thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations.
these results strongly support the underlying e structure in dilute al
model.

a yangian analogue of young tableaux arises in proof of t system.
the combinatorial aspect provides interesting problem on its own. we
thus believe that the subject is worth of further research.
