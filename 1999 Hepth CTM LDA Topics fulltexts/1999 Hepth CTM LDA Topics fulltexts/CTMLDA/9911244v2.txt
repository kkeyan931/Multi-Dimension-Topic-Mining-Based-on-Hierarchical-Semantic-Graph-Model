abstract

we analyse the equivalence between topologically massive gauge theory

(tmgt) and dierent formulations of non-topologically massive gauge theo-

ries (ntmgts) in the canonical approach. the dierent ntmgts studied

are stuckelberg formulation of (a) a rst order formulation involving one and

two form elds, (b) proca theory, and (c) massive kalb-ramond theory. we

rst quantise these reducible gauge systems by using the phase space exten-

sion procedure and using it, identify the phase space variables of ntmgts

which are equivalent to the canonical variables of tmgt and show that un-

der this the hamiltonian also get mapped. interestingly it is found that the

dierent ntmgts are equivalent to dierent formulations of tmgts which

dier only by a total divergence term. we also provide covariant mappings

between the elds in tmgt to ntmgts at the level of correlation function.

massive gauge theories have been a subject of intense study with popular approach being

the higgs mechanism. the fact that the higgs boson is yet experimentally elusive, forces

an intense study of alternate models displaying gauge invariant massive spin-1 elds. one

such model which is being studied at both abelian and non-abelian level [1] is toplogically

massive gauge theory (tmgt), known as bf theory, where one and two form gauge

elds are coupled in a gauge invariant way. bf theory has also found applications in

areas like josphson junction arreys, black hole physics etc,. [2]. there also exist other non-

topologically massive gauge theories (ntmgts), wherein stuckelberg elds are added with

a compensating transformation [3], such that the mass term in the lagrangian is gauge

invariant. the reason for this nomenclature is, as explained below, the equations of motion

for the former case vanishes as an identity whereas for the latter they vanish as a consequence

of other equations of motion. the purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between

these two apparently dierent formulations. equivalence of degrees of freedom between

tmgt and proca theory and their higher dimensional generalizations has been shown in

[4]. the ntmgts studied here are stuckelberg formulations of (a) a rst order formulation

involving one and two form elds, (b) proca theory, and (c) massive kalb-ramond(k-r)

theory described below ( cf: (29),(45) and (50) respectively). non-abelian version of (a),

with out the stuckelberg elds have been discussed in [5]. the massive stuckelberg form of

k-r theory has been studied in [6] and has also occured in a description of conning string [7].

the equivalence of the rst one of the above to bf theory has been established recently by

phase space path integral approach [8]. duality equivalence, following buschers procedure

[9] was established between tmgt and ntmgts (b and c) [10]. but a complete analysis

of the equivalence between tmgt and ntmgts from the hamiltonian formulation is still

lacking. also these systems by themselves are interesting due to their interesting constraint

structure. in this paper we analyse, from the canonical frame work, the equivalence between

bf theory and ntmgts by providing a mapping between the phase space variables of

tmgt to free ntmgts which render the same algebra in the respective reduced phase

2

spaces. this mapping between the canonical variables also map the corresponding canonical

hamiltonians and the equations of motion. interestingly it is found that dierent ntmgts

gets mapped to dierent formulations of tmgt which dier only by a total divergence.

we point out that evaluation of dirac brackets for these reducible systems following the

phase space extension approach developed recently in [11] by itself is a new result. we also

provide an equivalence at the level of corelators for the eld in conguration space between

the tmgt and ntmgts. this paper is organised in the following way: in section i we

study the hamiltonian formulation of the model given in (1), and quantise it by enlarging

the phase space by introducing a pair of new canonical coordinates and obtain the dirac

brackets. in section ii we quantize the three dierent spin-one ntmgts, taking into account

of the reducibility in the same way. in section iii, we nd the mapping between the phase

space variables of bf theory to the stuckelberg formulations which generates the same

algebra of canonical variables in the reduced phase space. we conclude with discussion in

section iv.

we use the metric g = diag(1, 1  1  1) and 0123 = 1.

section i

the lagrangian for the abelian b f theory is given by

l = 

1

f f  +

hh  +

bf ,

(1)

where f and h are the eld strengths associated with the elds a and b. the

equation of motion following from this lagrangian are

and

f  +

m
3!

h = 0,

h   m a = 0.

(2)

(3)

it is easy to see that this system describes a free spin-one theory by solving the linearly

coupled equations (2) and (3). since the divergence of (2) and (3) vanishes as an identity,

3

the lagrangian (1) is said to describe tmgt. this should be contrasted with ntmgts

given in section ii, where the divergence of equations of motion vanish only after using other

equations of motion.

the primary constraint following from the lagrangian are 0 and 0i which are the

momentum conjugates of a0and b0i respectively. the momenta, from which velocities are

inverted , are given by,

i = f0i +

m

0ijkbjk,

ij = h0ij.

the canonical hamiltonian following from this lagrangian is,

hc =

the consistancy of the primary constraints leads to the secondary constraints,

i =  jij +

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

note that these are rst class and (8) is reducible; ii = 0. the gauge -xing conditions

for these constraint are given by

iai  0,

i = jbij  0.

(9)

(10)

here the gauge-xing condition jbij  0 is also not linearly independent.

in usual dirac procedure, one rst isolate the linearly independent constraints, and then

procede to construct the dirac brackets [12]. but this elimination can not be done uniquely.

more over, in general, the linearly independent constraints obtained in this way do not

generate all those transformations under which the lagrangian is invariant. both these

4

deects can be avoided in the phase space extension method developed in [11]. here one

handles the reduciblity by modifying the constraints itself. in this method one enlarges the

phase space by introducing a pair of canonically congugate auxiliary variables p, and q with

{p(x) , q(y)}p b =  (~x  ~y).

the modied constraint and the coresponding gauge-xing condition become,

i =  jij +

0ijkf jk + ip  0,

m
2
 = jbij + iq  0.

(11)

(12)

(13)

note that constraints are no longer reducible. the primary rst class constraints have the

gauge -xing conditions,

a0  0,

boi  0.

(14)

(15)

the non-vanishing dirac brackets, computed using the modied constraints are now given

by,

nbij(x) , lm(y)o

nai(x) , l(y)o

=  l

i +

2 ! (x  y),

j il(cid:17)(cid:21) (x  y),

{i(x) , lm(y)} = 

m
2 (0ilj m  0imj l) j(x  y).

(17)

(18)

(16, 17, and 18) are in agreement with the dirac brackets obtained by other methods [13].

note that the dirac brackets are independent of the new variables p and q. once the

dirac brackets are evaluvated, we can implement the constraints strongly. hence, on the

constraint surface, i i = 2p = 0 . this sets the auxiliary variable p = 0. in the same

5

way we get q = 0. thus the new variables introduced to handle reducibility vanish on the

constraint surface and do not appear in the nal dirac brackets.

next we study in the same manner two other equivalent formulations of bf theory

(diering only by a total divergence), where the topological term is ha or (bf  ha).

we refer them as ha and symmetric bf formulations respectively. the reason for this

study is that these dierent formulations map naturaly to the dierent formulations of

ntmgts.

instead of + m

4 bf 

term in (1), now we consider  m

23! h a (ha

formulation). the primary constraints remain the same, but the momenta for the uncon-

strained elds are now,

i = f0i,

ij = h0ij  m0ijkak.

and the structure of the secondary constraints are changed to

 = ii +

0ijkibjk

m

i = jij.

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

the canonical hamiltonian now reads,

(23)

note again that the second constraint (22) is a reducible one, which can be handled in the

same way as in (12) and (13). the dirac brackets {ai, j}and{bij, lm} remains the same

as (16) and (17) while that between the momenta now reads,

{i , lm} =

m
2 0lmj ij (x  y).

(24)

next we give the constraint structure of (1), where the mass term is written symmetrically

as + m

8 b f  +  m

43! h a . primary constraints again remain same and the

secondary constraints are now,

(25)

(26)

here too, one of the constraints (26) is reducible. the canonical hamiltonian will now read

menta will now become

{i, jk} =

(28)

section ii

in this section we quantise the three dierent stuckelberg formulations (a, b, and c)

the lagrangian describing (a) is

where c = (c  c). this lagrangian is invariant under the transformations(g) =

, () = , and (h) = (  ), (c) = . note that when  = ,

h is invariant implying the reducible nature of the constraints.

the primary constraints following from this lagrangian are

0, 0i, 0,

i = (i

ij = (ij +

0ijkgk).

in the above,  are the conjugate momenta corresponding to c elds and  is the

conjugate momentum of . following fadeev and jackiw, [14] we imppose the symplectic

conditions(31) and (32) strongly. this results a non-vanishing bracket

{gi , hij}pb = m0ijk(~x  ~y).

(37)

since ii +  = 0, this theory is reducible.

as in the previous section, we introduce auxiliary phase space variables p and q obeying

(11) and modify i to i + ip to handle reducibility.

we choose the gauge xing conditions to be

igi  0,

lh ml + mq  0,

ici  0.

now the non-vanishing dirac bracekts are

{gi(x) , hjk(y)} = m"oljk(l

{ i(x) , c j(y)} = "j

next we consider the lagrangian describing (b),

(45)

this is the well studied stuckelberg - proca lagrangian and not a reducible system. we

give the dirac brackets, which are rather well known. the hamiltonian follwoing from this

lagrangian is

(46)

and the constraints 0  0,  = (ii  m )  0, are rst class. the non-vanishing dirac

brackets evaluvated in coloumb gauge are

{ai , j} = (j

ij

{  , } = (~x  ~y),

{i , } =

the lagrangian describing (c) is

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

where  = (  ), and  is the stuckelberg eld. the canonical hamiltonian

(51)

the persistence of the primary constraints 0  0, and 0i  0 give the gauss law

constraints,

 = ii  0,

i = (j ij + mi)  0.

(52)

(53)

all these constraints are rst class. here, we have ii + m = 0, which implies that

i and  are not linearly independent and thus the stuckelberg formulation given by the

lagrangian (50) describes a reducible gauge system.

9

here also we handle reducible constraints and their gauge xing conditions in the same

way as we have done in the other two reducible theories by enlarging the phase space by

introducing auxilliary variables p and q obeying (11). the modied constraint and gauge

xing condition are

i = jij  mi + ip,

i = lbil + iq,

and corresponding to the generator , we choose the gauge condition

ii  0.

the non-vanishing dirac brackets are

{ij(x) , l(y)} =

2 (il

j  jl

(57)

(58)

(59)

this completes the hamiltonian analysis of ntmgts.

section iii

in this section, from the considerations of the algebra of phase space variables in the

reduced phase space of the ntmgts and tmgt, we arrive at the following corespondance

between the canonical variables.

the mappings between the phase space variables of symmetric bf theory and ntmgt

(a) is

(l +

m

0lmnbmn)bf

2

0lmn(hmn  cmn)a,

(gi)a,

(hij)a.

(61)

(62)

(63)

(64)

(65)

under this map the dirac brackets (41),(42),(43)and (44) and the hamiltonian (33) of the

stuckelberg theory (29) gets mapped to that of symmetric bf theory.

in the case of the stuckelberg formulation described by(45), the mapping

(ij)bf  (oijkk)b,

(bij)bf  (

1
2 oijkk )b,
(ai)bf  (ai)b,

(i)bf  (i)b,

(66)

(67)

(68)

(69)

transform the dirac brackets(47), (48) and (49) and the hamiltonian of (46) to that of ha

theory(23).

from the dirac bracket structure of (50) and bf the following mappings can be ob-

tained,

(i)bf  (0ijkjk)c,

(ai)bf  (

1
2 0ijkjk)c,
(bij)bf  (bij)c,

(ij)bf  (ij)c,

(70)

(71)

(72)

(73)

under which the dirac brackets(57), (58) and (59) and the hamiltonian of stuckelberg

formulation(51) gets mapped to that of bf theory (1).

thus in the case of the mapping from tmgt to (b), the two form eld and its conjugate

momentum undergo a canonical transformation and in the case of mapping from tmgt to

11

(c), the vector eld and its momentum transform canonically.

it can be checked that these identications also map their respective hamiltonian equa-

tions of motions.

section iv

we have found the mappings betwen the canonical variables of ntmgts (a), (b),

and (c) to bf , ha and symmetric bf formulations respectively. this is consistent

with our earlier observation that the bf and ha formulations go over to (c) and (b)

respectively by buschers duality procedure. this is understandable as buschers procedure

is itself is known to be a canonical transformation [15]. the rst order stuckelberg theory

was also shown to be equivalent to symmetric bf theory by phase space path integral

approach, which is in agreement with what is observed here. thus this analysis in the

canonical approach neatly complements the earlier studies.

the gauss law constraint (7) and its gauge xing condition in the case of bf theory

can be solved uniquely on the reduced phase space to get i = oijkj k and ai = 0ijkj k.

here i is an arbitrary eld and k is its conjugate momentum. these solutions, after

idetifying i andi with the stuckelberg eld and its momentum (scaled by a factor of

1

2 )

are same as the mappings (70) and (71).

in the case of ha theory also we can solve

the gauss law constraint (22) and its gauge xing condition unquiely. these solutions,

also provide the same mappings (66) and (67). thus the mapping of tmgts to ntmgts

depend on the form of the gauss law constraints.

we can also bring out the identication between the elds of in tmgt and ntmts in

a covariant way in lagrangian formulation. for this purpose, couple the gauge invariant

(dual) eld strengths f and h in bf theory to sources j  and j  respectively. by

following the buschers duality procedure, as in [10], we get the dual lagrangian to be that

of (50), with additional source dependent terms of the form

j  h 

1
4

j j  +

1
2

(mb  )j  .

12

the sources have to be coupled to eld strengths, rather than to the elds, so that there is

a global shift symmetry of the elds, needed for applying buschers procedure. thus we get

the identication, at the level of correlation function

d f(x), f(y)ebf

= d b(x), b(y)ec

+ (gg  gg) (x  y),

(74)

where b = (mb  ). thus, apart from this contact term, we identify f in bf

theory to (mb  ) of the stuckelberg formulation (c). similar analysis can be done

with the other equivalent formulation of bf theory (23), leading to the identication h

in ha theory to (ma  ) of the stuckelberg formulation of proca theory (b). also

by starting with the rst-order lagrangian (29) and using the same procedure we identify

(g + ) and (h  c) of (29) to h and f respectively, of the symmetric bf

theory. all these identication are modulo non-propagating contact terms. note that in all

cases gauge invariant led strengths of tmgt get mapped to gauge invariant combination

of elds in ntmgts.

it will be interesting to see whether the equivalence established here for free theories will

hold good for the interacting as well as for the non-abelian generalisations of the models

studied in this paper. work along these lines is in progress.
