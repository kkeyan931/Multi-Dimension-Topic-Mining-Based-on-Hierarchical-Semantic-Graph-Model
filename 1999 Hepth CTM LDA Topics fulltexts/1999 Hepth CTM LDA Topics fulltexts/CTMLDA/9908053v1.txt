we construct a tensionless string model in a four-dimensional space-time r2,2
with the (2,2) signature and solve the string equations. we nd that the signature
change radically changes the structure of the holonomy group of the null worldsheet.
as a result the introduction of the worldsheet dirac operator invariant under the
holonomy group becomes possible. we show that the such possibility is absent in
the tensionless string model in the (3+1)-dimensional minkowski space.

the extended tensionless objects - null strings [1] and null p-branes [2] are character-
ized by a simple dynamics which combines the properties of massless particles (equations
of motion) and strings/p-branes (constraints). it gives a possibility to probe the compli-
cated problems of the nonlinear (super)string/p-brane dynamics in the simplied picture
of the null (super)string/p-brane dynamics [3, 2].
in particular, null (super)string/p-
brane may be covariantly quantized [4] and their equations are exactly solvable for the
cases of some interesting backgrounds [5]. it was shown in [6] that the null string action
may be used as the zero approximation action in a perturbative description of the string
dynamics in curved spaces [9]. in [7, 8] was observed that the inclusion of the worldsheet
electromagnetism into the null superstring action allows a geometric interpretation of the
green-schwarz superstring symmetries and leads to the string tension generation. the

examination of the zero tension limit in the d-brane theory [10] allows to obvserve its
parton-like structure which is close to the structures of the matrix model of m-theory [11]
and the p-brane dynamics [12].
it was shown in [13, 14] that the tension generation
mechanism [7] is also selfconsistent with the d-brane dynamics.

but there is one important dierence between the tensionless and tensile superstrings.
the tensionless (super)strings/p-branes have no any critical dimension and are selfcon-
sistent objects, in particular, in the (3+1)-dimensional minkowski space. therefore, it
seems rather interesting to investigate the reaction of the null string dynamics under the
deformations of the space-time structure. topological deformations belong to the most
interesting ones, because they aect the string dynamics and may change the value of the
critical dimension. the latter possibility was realized in the spinning string model with
the n = 2 worldsheet conformal symmetry [15] which turned out to be selfconsistentl in a
(2+2)-dimensional space-time [16]. the massless elds generated by the n = 2 spinning
string are the self-dual yang-mills or gravitation elds [17], which are closely connected
with the exactly integrable systems [18]. a supersymmetric generalization of the self-dual
yang-mills/supergravity theories in (2+2) dimensions has shown the existence of the real
chiral scalar supermultiplet [19]. therefore, one can conclude that the signature chang-
ing is a constructive operation which shed light on the subtle correllation between the
world-sheet symmetry, supersymmetry, critical dimension and exact integrability.

the objective of the present letter is to continue the investigation of posible physical
eects in the string dynamics which arise from the signature change. to this end we
construct here a model of free bosonic null string moving in the at space r2,2 and prove
the exact solvability of the string equaitons. we establish that the signature change opens
a possibility to build the worldsheet dirac operator invariant under the holonomy group
of the null worldsheet. we show that the such possibility is absent in the case of null
string embedded into the minkowski space r3,1.

our rules for the indices usage are the following: , , . . . = 1, . . . , 4 over r2,2 and

0, . . . , 3 over r3,1; i, k = 1, 2; a, b, . . . = 1, . . . , 3; the worldsheet indices , , . . . = 1, 2.

1 the symmetry group of the r2,2 space is the semidirect product of the abelian trans-
lation subgroup with the generators p and the so(2, 2) group of the orthogonal trans-
formations with the generators j = j:

[p, p] = 0
[p, j] = p  p
[j, j] = j + j  j  j,

(1)

where  = diag(+1, +1, 1, 1) is the metric tensor. the matrix elements of the
so(2, 2) vector representation are

(j (v)

 )

.

 = 

  

(2)

2

the null plane having the coordinates x and passing through the coordinate system
origin in r2,2 is given by x  mi = 0, i = 1, 2, where

m

1 = (0, 1, 0, 1)

, m

2 = (1, 0, 1, 0).

then one can express the couple of the coordinates  i, parametrizing this null plane, by
the equations  i = ni  x, where

n
1 = (1, 0, 1, 0)

, n

2 = (0, 1, 0, 1)

(3)

ni  nk = mi  mk = 0 , ni  mk = 2ik.

let us dene now the subgroup of the rotations group transforming the null plane

onto itself by the conditions

l

n

i = ikn
k ,

(4)

where l
 are the so(2, 2) global transformations and ik are some coecients depending
on l. one can write down the innitesimal transformations with the parameters  =
 as

l

 =

(j (v)

the substitution of the representation (5) into eqs.(4) together with the use of the explicit
form of ni restrict the possible form of . as a result we nd l in the form of a
linear combination of the unity element and the symmetry group generators of the null
plane. it is easy to check that these generators are presented in the form

2x1 = j12  j34
d = j13 + j24

,

2x2 = j13  j24

,

2x3 = j14 + j23

, s = j12  j14 + j23 + j34

and satisfy the following commutation relations

[xa, xb] = abcx c

,

[xa, s] = [xa, d] = 0 ,

[d, s] = 2s,

(6)

(7)

where the three-dimensional
indices are raised and lowered by means of the tensor
ab = diag(1, +1, +1) and 123 = 1.
it is easy to nd that eqs. (7) produce the di-
rect product of the so(2, 1) group and the solvable group with the generators s and d.
let us consider now the action of these groups onto the vectors ni:

1) the generator s does not change the vectors ni of the null plane: (s(v))

n

i = 0

and may be omitted without any loss.

2) d is the dilatation generator: (d(v))

n

i = n

i and the abelian group created by it

will be denoted by d.

3) the action of the rest generators xa is given by

(x (v)

a )

n

i = (a)ikn
k ,

(8)

where the matrices

1 =   0 1

1 0 ! ,

2 =   1 0

0 1 ! ,

3 =   0 1
1 0 !

are the pauli matrices in the 2+1 dimensional space:

ab = ab  abcc.

(9)

i n

i n

k = ikn

taking into account the relations ik = (1)ik (12 = 21 = 1), the symmetry property
of the matrices 1a and the transformation rules (8) we nd that the bilinear form
ikn
k remains invariant under these transformations. then, in view of the
well known isomorphism so(2, 1)  sp(1, r) one can consider the null-plane as a at
symplectic manifold. to yield the complete symmetry group of the null plane we should
extend sp(1, r) by the generators

i = pi  pi+2,

(10)

which produce the shifts of the null plane into itself.

using (1) we nd that i compose the set of the sp(1, r) and d tensor operators:

[i, xa] = (a)ikk

,

[i, d] = i.

2 the dirac operator over r2,2 reads

 = p,

(11)

(12)

where p = 
x are the translation generators and  are the dirac matrices with the
algebra {, } = 2. the dirac operator on the null plane is the pullback of  to this
surface. expressing the derivatives /x in terms of i  / i and substituting them
into (12) we get

null = ii,

(13)

where i = i + i+2. as a result of {i, k} = 0, we nd that 2
dirac equation takes the form

null = 0 and then the

null = 0,

which should be sp(1, r) invariant. if so, this dirac equation is physically sensible one.
but we can prove more strong proposition that the dirac operator is invariant under the
groups sp(1, r) and d. . because of i = i, we can write down (13) as

null = ii

(14)

for the case of the scalar representation of the generators. the generators of the desired
sp(1, r) spinor representation are given by (6), where the generators of the corresponding

4

so(2, 2) representation are substituted. then, using the properties of -matrices we nd
that i are the tensor operators under sp(1, r) and d:

[i, x (s)

a ] = (a)kik

,

[i, d(s)] = i.

(15)

using eq. (11) we get

[ null, x (l)

a + x (s)

a ] = [ null, d(l) + d(s)] = 0,

where x (l)
a and d(l) are the generators of the scalar representations of sp(1, r) and d. the
explicit form of these generators is not essential because the commutation relations (11 )
contain all needed information. thus, the existence of the invariant dirac equation (13)
is proved.

3 by analogy with the previous case we can consider the null planes in the minkowski
space with  = diag(+1, 1, 1, 1). but now, the vector n1 is a lightlike vector
whereas n2 is a space-like one:

n1  n1 = n1  n2 = 0 , n2  n2 = 1.

(16)

let us choose them as

n
1 = (1, 1, 0, 0)

, n

2 = (0, 0, 0, 1).

the relations (1),(2),(5) and (12 ) remain invariable. one can conclude that the subgroup
of the so(3, 1) group dened by (4) is a three-parametric group with the generators

s = j02 + j12

, a1 = j01

, a2 = j03 + j13

(17)

which form the algebra

[a1, a2] = a2

,

[a1, s] = s ,

[a2, s] = 0.

the generator s does not change the vectors ni and may be omitted. the rest generators
form the group h which is a solvable one. the generator a1 produces dilatations of the
vector n

i and the generator a2 shifts n

2 by the light-like vector n
1 :

(ai)

n

k = ikn
1 .

the translation generators 1 = p0 + p1 and 2 = p3 are the tensor operators under h:

[i, ak] = ik1.

(18)

choosing the null plane coordinates so that the equality i = i remains correct and
considering the pullback of  to this null plane we obtain  in the form (14), where

5

1 = 0  1 and 2 = 3. using these matrices we can observe that the dirac
operator squared 2

null is equal to

2

null = 2
2

and it is not invariant under the holonomy group h of the null plane. indeed, this follows
from the innitezimal transformation of the holonomy group (18)

 2

null = 221kk2,

where the equality 2 = 2 was taken into account. the dirac operator null is also non
invariant under h, because

[ null, a(l)

i + a(s)

i

] 6= 0.

the non invariant character of 2
matrices property to compose a set of the tensor operators under h.

null and null is explained by the breakdown of the

1 and n

one can consider this fact as an equivalent expression of the impossibility to introduce
the complex structure over a null plane in the minkowski space. indeed, it is well-known
that a spinor eld is a representation of the rotational group. in the above considered
case of the null-string in r2,2 we found the introduction of spinor elds to be possible
because the null plane symmetry contains the rotation subgroup so(2, 1). this subgroup
exists because each point of the null plane in r2,2 has the two mutually orthogonal and
light-like vectors n
2 . the minkowski signature change, i.e., the passage of r2,2
into r3,1, radically changes the geometric structure of the null-plane. as a result the
introduction of only one light-like basis vector n
1 (16) becomes possible, whereas the
second linearly independent vector n
2 should be a space-like one. these two vectors
can not be transformed one to another by means of a rotation, because their norms
are dierent. therefore, we conclude that the rotation group can not be a symmetry
of our null-plane in r3,1.
in place of the rotation group so(2, 1) we get a solvable
two-parametric group, as it was proved earlier. therefore, the signature change makes
impossible to have the rotation group as the null plane symmetry group. this observation
implies impossibility to introduce spinor elds and the invariant dirac operator over the
null plane in the minkowski space-time.

4 a change of the null-plane by a light-like worldsheet embedded into r2,2 implies a
localization of the sp(1, r) group together with the introduction of the corresponding
worldsheet covariant derivatives. to this end let us consider the innitesimal symplectic
transformation with the parameters a:

  1 + aa.

(19)

the characterizing property of the dirac -matrices to be invariant under the transfor-
mations of their vector and spinor indices

uiu 1 = kki

6

(20)

yields the correspondence between the sp(1, r) transformations and the 4-spinor trans-
formations u. using this property together with eqs. (9) and (15) we obtain

a a,
(a1) (ux (s)au 1) = ax (s)a.

u  1 + 2x (s)

(21)
(22)

the local sp(1, r) transformations (19) of the vector vi lying on the plane tangent to
the strings worldsheet are vi = i
kvk. taking into account this transformation law one
can dene the covariant dierential in the tangent space

dvi = dvi + i

k(d)vk,

where ik  sl(2, r) is the connection 1-form in the tangent space. it can be then observed
that this covariant derivative transforms under the local sp(1, r) transformations in just
the same way as vi. then eqs. (9) and (22) result in the conclusion that the spinor
covariant derivative

d =

d
d 

, d = d + i

k(d)(a)ikx (s)a

correctly transforms under the transformations (19)

d

 = ud ,  = u.

(23)

ke
further we introduce the inverse zveinbein e
k
under the local rotations of the worldsheet tangent space (19). equations (23) and (20)
yield then the desired denition of the general covariant worldsheet dirac operator

i with the transformation law e

i = i

null = ie

i d

which correctly transforms under the considered symplectic transformations:



null = u nullu 1

.

5 here we study the simplest model of the bosonic null string embedded in r2,2. the
null strings worldsheet has the above desribed symplectic structure. in the rst place we
introduce the local moving frame composed of the two light-like vectors (ni, mi) attached
to the null worldsheet:

ni  nk = mi  mk = 0 ,

ni  mk = 2ik

(24)

and next construct the antisymmetric tensor n  = ik n
k. afterwards, following to the
prescription given in [3] we can write down the action of the symplectic string in the form

i n

s = z d d(cid:16)nxx  eik ni  nk(cid:17),

(25)

7

where  =  1 ,  =  2 and eik is a world sheet density ensuring the reparametrization
invariance of the action s. the euler-lagrange equations produced by s are

xximnm = eik n

k

nx = 0.

let us look for the general solution of eqs. (26),(27) in the form of the expansion

if the expansion (28) is substituted into eqs (26) one yields the conditions

x = ai

taking into account the conditions (29) we can present the solution (26) as

x = ak

|a|

(a2

it follows from eq. (30) that the worldsheet metric g

induced by the embedding into r2,2 is degenerate, i.e., |g| = 0, as it should be for the
light-like surface. moreover, the factorization of g (31) shows that it can be vanished
by the choice a2
. in view of these conditions the moving frame (ni, mi) orientation
concerning the null strings worldsheet and its embedding into r2,2 are xed. the solution
of the string equations (26) implied by the conditions g = 0, or equivalently |a| = 0,
takes the form

 = a1

(32)
where the isotropic vectors na (a = 1, 2) tangent to the null strings worldsheet and
zveinbein ea

 are dened by the relations

taking into account the solutions (32),(33) we get nx = 2e2
above expression into eqs. (26) we reduce them to the equations

n1. substituting the

(e2

n1) = 0.

(35)

using the solutions (32) one can present the 4-vector n1 in the form n1 = e
substitution of this representation into eqs. (35) transforms the latter to

1x. the next

in view of the arbitrariness in the choice of the worldsheet gauge we can x it by the
conditions e2

 . in this gauge eqs. (36)take the form

he2
1xi = 0.
e

(36)

..
x = 0 = x = q() + p (),

which coincide with the equations of null string embedded in the minkowski space [1, 2].
by the virtue of the symmetry between  and  for this embedding into r2,2 there exists
another gauge e2

 , in which the string equations (36) take the form

 = 0 , e1

 = e1


x = 0.

thus, we conclude that the null string dynamics described by the action (25) in r2,2 is
selfconsistent.

the following natural step is the introduction of the worldsheet spinor elds into
the bosonic action (25). this extension is supported by the existence of the invariant
worldsheet dirac operator, as it was shown here. the simplest extension consists in the
addition of the kinetic term sfermi for the massless dirac eld

sfermi = z d2 e null,

where e is the world sheet density contructed of eik [2, 3]. note, that this extension
doesnt suggest the presence of any supersymmetry. the inclusion of spinor elds may
shed new light onto the troubles of the string theory, in particular, the problem of the
mass/tension generation since the worldsheet spinor structure doesnt depend of the ten-
sion value.

other generalizations such as the supersymmetrization of the world sheet or/and r2,2
space, introduction of the worldsheet electromagnetic or other internal elds, embedding
into curved space and other backgrounds are also possible.
