(4.5) (4.6) example, consider bogomolny monopole maximal symmetry breaking equal monopole masses given b0() = b1() = 2. 0 = diag(2, 0, 2) boundary conditions force c0() = c1() = 0 g0 = diag(2, 0, 2). comparing equation (2.5) see magnetic charges (n1, n2) = (2, 2). bogomolny monopoles solutions obtained explicitly monopole charges understood terms degrees harmonic map projectors constructed {$9903183$}. rst site might appear (4.6) magnetic charges determined boundary values cj() independent values bj(). however, naive view incorrect easily seen considering simple case anti-bogomolny solution b0() = b1() = 2. boundary conditions imply c0() = c1() = 0 hence obtain matrix g0 = diag(2, 0, 2). must aware case 0 = diag(2, 0, 2) entries correctly ordered largest smallest. constant gauge transformation permutes entries obtain 0 = diag(2, 0, 2) acts way magnetic charge matrix gauge transformation left charge matrix g0 = diag(2, 0, 2). 0 correct order compare charge matrix equation (2.5) conclude (n1, n2) = (2, 2). although example computing magnetic charges trivial illustrates important point asymptotic values bj() required order determine magnetic charges. shall see interesting consequences fact follows. moment shall consider case bj() 6= 0, boundary conditions cj() = 0 j = 0, 1. bogomolny equations (4.3) integrable allow explicit solutions found choice positive parameters b0(), b1(), give monopole masses m1, m2. however, seems unlikely explicit non- bogomolny solutions second order equations (4.1) found closed form. therefore resort numerical solution equations. apply gradient ow algorithm nite dierence scheme compute solution given set boundary values b0(), b1(). choices parameters able nd numerical solution. test accuracy code computed charge (2, 2) bogomolny solution b0() = b1() = 2. case, since monopole masses equal, m1 = m2 = 2, total number monopoles four energy e = 8. 8 value energy obtained numerical code within accuracy three decimal places. order consider non-bogomolny analogue solution want x monopole masses way m1 = m2 = 2. thus eigenvalues 0 must 0 2, though time order correct. example, consider choice ordering 0 = diag(0, 2, 2), (4.5) corresponds boundary values b0() = 2 b1() = 4. thus, since b0() b1() opposite sign, gives non-bogomolny solution. figure 1.1 plot functions b0, b1, c0, c1 obtained numerical solution case. figure 1.2 plot energy density solution (solid line) energy density corresponding bogomolny solution (dashed line). note dip energy density origin non-bogomolny solution, energy density isosurfaces shell-like. compute energy solution e = 9.0, larger bogomolny solution. discussed above, entries magnetic charge matrix must also permuted (in accordance permutation entries higgs eld obtain correct ordering) results g0 = diag(0, 2, 2). comparison (2.5) gives charges (n1, n2) = (0, 2). clearly energy solution little bogomolny bound (2.7), would nice understand value. aim mind attempt phenomenology interpret charge energy monopole. mentioned section 3 projectors used harmonic map ansatz sigma model interpretation terms instanton anti-instanton congurations. however, bogomolny monopole solutions clearly anti-monopoles, appears case prole functions monopole see anti-soliton content. nevertheless, prole functions modied non-bogomolny solution anti-soliton content becomes visible already seen signature terms signs asymptotic values prole functions. suggests think charge (0, 2) solution composite (0, 2) = (+2 2, +2 0), plus signs denote monopoles minus signs anti-monopoles (the positive monopole content taken bogomolny solution). interpretation (0, 2) solution contains two monopoles two monopole anti-monopole pairs. since energy solution e = 9.0 monopole mass 2, phenomenology gives approximate value energy monopole anti-monopole pair em = 2.5. value least reasonable, since (having normalized monopole mass 2) energy monopole anti-monopole pair something less 4; precise value depends details monopole anti-monopole interaction. non-trivial tests interpretation arise later consider su(4) monopoles. note although know solutions global minima expect unstable (to annihilation monopole anti-monopole pairs) proved unstable. stability analysis would need undertaken prove solutions local minima, though would extremely surprising stable. su(3) six possible ways order eigenvalues higgs eld corresponding monopole charges (2, 2), (0, 2), (2, 0), thus monopole 9 solutions trivially related two examples discussed. 2, 1 let us turn minimal symmetry breaking, may take given 0 = diag(1, 1 2). bogomolny monopole boundary values given b0() = 3 2 b1() = 0. since second prole function vanishes innity boundary conditions allow c1() 6= 0. bogomolny solution found explicitly appropriate boundary condition turns {$9903183$} c1() = 12 , gives charge (2, ). notation magnetic weights denoted square brackets. monopole masses m1 = 3 2, m2 = 0, energy e = 3. recall bogomolny solutions property bjs innity sign, whereas non-bogomolny solutions case. thus one may wonder whether two types solution smoothly connected values (one more) bj() varied change sign. answer not, since smooth variation must pass point bj() = 0 (as see above) symmetry breaking pattern changes boundary condition cj() suers discontinuous jump. 2 , 1, 1 bogomolny monopoles non-maximal symmetry breaking pattern requires vanishing least one bj(), non-bogomolny monopoles case. example, permuting eigenvalues order 0 = diag( 1 2) corresponds choice b0() = b1() = 3 2 hence charge (0, ). symmetry equations (4.1) together symmetry boundary conditions case force reduction c0 = c1 b0 = b1. minimally broken su(3) non-bogomolny monopole arises specic reduction obtained previously burzla , using hedgehog-like ansatz group theoretic approach gauge potential involves principle su(2) triplet su(3) higgs eld involves associated 5-plet. burzla  proved existence solution equations result case. important feature proof fact equations arise variation energy functional therefore remains show minimizer exists, standard methods employed. general case variational formulation comes yang-mills-higgs energy possible use similar techniques prove existence solutions. paper content numerical solutions prole function equations shown figure 1.3 case charge (0, ). figure 1.4 plot energy density solution (solid line) energy density corresponding bogomolny charge (2, ) solution (dashed line). note dip energy density near origin non-bogomolny solution. energy non-bogomolny solution found e = 4.3, compared energy e = 3 bogomolny solution. 4.3 su(4) n = 4 six prole functions, bj, cj, j = 0, 1, 2, yang-mills-higgs equations reduce (r2b0) = 6c2 0b0 4c2 1b1 10 (r2b1) = 8c2 (r2b2) = 6c2 2b2 0b0 3c2 1b1 3c2 2b2 4c2 1b1 0 2c2 1 1 + b2 c2 0 1 1 1 + b2 2 2c2 3 2 3 2 r2c0 = c0(3c2 r2c1 = c1(4c2 r2c2 = c2(3c2 c2 1 1 + b2 1r2) 0r2) 2r2).
