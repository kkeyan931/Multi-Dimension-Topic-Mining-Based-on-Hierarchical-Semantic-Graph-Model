abstract

the n = 1 self-dual supergravity has sl(2, c) symmetry and the left-

handed and right-handed local supersymmetries. these symmetries result

in su(2) charges as the angular-momentum and the supercharges. the

model possesses also the invariance under the general translation trans-

forms and this invariance leads to the energy-momentum. all the def-

initions are generally covariant. as the su(2) charges and the energy-

momentum we obtained previously constituting the 3-poincare algebra in

the ashtekarcomplex gravity, the su(2) charges, the supercharges and the

energy-momentum in simple supergravity also restore the super-poincare

algebra, and this serves to support the reasonableness of their interpreta-

tions.

introduction

the study of self-dual gravities has drawn much attention in the past decade since the discovery

of ashtekars new variables, in terms of which the constraints can be greatly simplied[1]-[2]. the

new phase variables consist of densitized su(2) soldering forms ei
obtained according to the denition qij = treiej, and a complexied connection aia
the momentum dependence in its imaginary part. the original ashtekars self-dual canonical grav-

b from which a metric density

a

b which carries

ity permits also a lagrangian formulation[3] -[4]. the supersymmetric extension of this lagrangian

formulation, which is equivalent to the simple real supergravity, was proposed by jacobson[5], and

the corresponding ashtekar complex canonical transform was given by gorobey et al[6].

in our previous works, we have obtained the su(2) charges and the energy-momentum in the

ashtekars formulation of einstein gravity[7]-[8] and they are closely related to the angular-momentum[9

[11] and the energy-momentum [12] in the vierbein formalism of einstein gravity. the fact that the

algebra formed by their poisson brackets do constitute the 3-poincare algebra on the cauchy surface

supports from another aspect that their denitions are reasonable.

out of the same reason, the denitions of su(2) charges, which are to be interpreted as the

angular-momentum, the supercharges and the energy-momentum are also interesting and importan

aspects in the simple self-dual supergravity. in this paper, we will exploit the sl(2, c) invariance,

the left-handed and right-handed supersymmetry and the invarinace under the general translation

transform[12] to obtain the conservative charges under consideration. this paper is arranged as

follows.

in section 2, we will give a brief review of the n = 1 self-dual supergravity.

in section

3, we will derive the su(2) charges from the original lagrangian of jacobson.

in section 4, w

derive the energy-momentum from a slightly dierent lagrangian and the general translation. in

section 5, we derive the supercharges from the invariance under left-handed and right-handed local

supersymmetric transforms. the last section is devoted to summary and discussions.

the dynamical variables are the real tetrad eaa (the real means eaa = eaa), the traceless left-

the indices are lowered and raised with the antisymmetric sl(2, c) spinor ab and its inverse ab

according to the convention b = aab, a = abb, and the implied summations are always in

north-westerly fashion: from the left-upper to the right-lower. the lagrangian eq.(1) is a holomorphic

functions of the connection and the equation for aa

b is equivalent to

the lagrangian lj is invariant without using any one of the euler-lagrangian equations while under
the right-handed transform

eaa = iaa

lj is invariant modulo the eld equations.
the (3+1) decomposition is eected as

the 0-components e0aa, 0a, 0a and a0ab are just the lagrange multipliers and the dynamical
conjugate pairs are (ekab, ajab), (ka, ka). the constraints haa = 0 and sa = 0 generate the

thus we have

superalgebra complex supergravity

when calculating the variation of the lagrangian, one must take into consideration of the anticom-

muting feature of the gravitino eld. we write the variation in the way that

lj = a(


a  



a )lj + (a



alj )

(22)

where a denotes any eld involved in the rst order lagrangian. now both 

a and



a are

(anti-)commuting if a is (anti-)commuting, and so there is no ordering problem.

the invariance of lj under the innitesimal sl(2, c) transform is equivalent to the following

modulo the eld equations

(aa

for constant , we have

we have therefore the conservation of su(2) charges

so

using

we have

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

which is exactly the same as eq.(30) we can thus have the poisson brackets

(jm an b + jm bn a + jn am b + jm an b)

(35)

now the at dreibein on  is needed in order to nd the angular- momentum ji. to clarify the

notions, we use the following conventions: , , ... denote the 4-dim curved indices and i, j, k, denote

the 3-dim curved indices on ; a, b, c, ... denote the at 4-dim indices and l, m, n, ... denote the at

3-dim indices on . the rigid at vierbein is denoted as ea

aa and the rigid at dreibein is denoted

by em

ab. then dene

and using the relation mnlemen = 2el we have

jm :=

eab

m jab

{jm, jn} = mnlj l

(36)

(37)

therefore the su(2) algebra is restored. one may doubt the niteness of jm n for isolated systems.

they are indeed nite because, in the non-supersymmetric case, jm n is related to jab by a linear

transform[8], where jab is the angular-mometum obtained in the vierbein formalism and are proved

nite for general isolated systems, further, it can give the correct formula of radiation of angular-

momentum.

[9]-[10]. as in the non-supersymmetric case[8], we can also obtain only the su(2)

superalgebra complex supergravity

charges instead of the whole sl(2, c) charges. yet, the angualr-momentum jab obtained in[9]- [10

is completely contained in jm n (see section 5).

4 the energy-momentum

in order to obtain the energy-momentum, we do not exploit the lagrangian lj . instead,we use the
following l

l =

1
2

[(eaa

 eba)aa

b + eaa

 ebaaa

m am

b +

i
2

eaa


ada

i.e.

i

(eaa



aa + eaa

  aa) +

i
2

eaa


abaa

b]

l = lj 

1
2

(eaa

 ebaaa

b + ieaa



aa)

(38)

(39)

so as far as the euler-lagrange equations are concerned, l and lj are equivalent. but why do we use
l rather than lj ? as discussed in [13], conservative quantities in general relativity are often quasi-
local, i.e. can be expressed as a surface integral at . whence total divergences in the lagrangian

may do non-trivial contribution to the conservative quantities though they do not aect the motion

equations. in the non-supersymmetric case, we also used a dierent lagrangian in order to obtain

the energy-momentum thereof[7]. in order to agree with the denition of energy-momentum in the

non-supersymmetric case, in which the energy-momentum agree exactly with the adm denition,

we use the lagrangian (38) here.

since the action i = r ld4x is invariant under the innitesimal transform x = x +x, 

(x) + 

, am n , a, a we have the noether theorem



,, here 

 = eaa

(x)

(ldx + 0



l



) + 0

[l]



= 0

where [l]



= ( 


  






)l and 0

 = 

dx. using the eld equations, we have

  
l





(ldx + 0

) = 0

(40)

(41)

since all the elds 

 have a lower curved index, we have 

. (the , denotes partial

,

derivative). therefore, 0

x. hence we have

,

 = x
[(l

  

  
l





)x  (



l



)x

,] = 0

(42)

superalgebra complex supergravity

which can be expressed as

[ i 

 x + v 

 x

,] = 0

therefore the independence of x, x

, and x

 implies

 i 

 = 0,

i 
 =  v 
 ,

v 
 =  v 



(43)

(44)

finally, we use the general translation: x = e

aabaa, baa is an arbitrary innitesimal four-vector.
this step is cruicial. note that as discussed in [7], the general coordinate transform x =  does

not in fact eect a translation because x can be any curvilinear coordinate. now we have

( i 

 e

aa + v 

 e

aa) = 0

the energy-momentum tensor is dened to be

aa := et
t

aa := i 

 e

aa + v 

 e

aa

so

(et

aa) = 0

using i 

 =  v 

 , we have

aa =  v

aa := v 
v

we have

(53)

for a closed system, the conservative energy-momentum is

(54)

(55)

now we use the reality of paa to simplify the expression. since both sides of eq.(4) are real, the
rst term is real. it is also because of the reality of ia  a, the last two terms contribute nothing
to the real paa. so we have

pn n  = z

from eq.(4) we have [jak]a = 2i(d[jek])aa. therefore

(56)

(57)

to make the 3+1 decomposition of paa, we may use two ways. the rst one is to use the

relationship between the at sl(2, c) soldering form ea

(63)

superalgebra complex supergravity

i.e.

the second way is to use

p0 = i

i = (m

b

(note that e

aa := geaa while e

ab := geab, n = (n0, 0, 0, 0)). substituting the rst term
which is spatial of the r.h.s of eq.(66) into eq(57) gives the momentum pm and the second term gives

the energy p0. the result is the same.

we now rescale the energy-momentum by a constant factor 22. i.e.

paa = 2z
p0 = i2z

ijkejbaaka

ijk tr ejakdsi

pm = 2z

ijk(ajek)m n em n

(68)

(69)

(70)

so that it agrees exactly with that of the non-sypersymmetric case[7].

the poisson bracket {jm n , pab} can be calculated using (eiei)(m n ) = 0,2e[jek] = q1/2ijk

and

the result is

therefore

{jm n , pab} =

to calculate {pm n , pab}, one of the two p s must be expressed as a 3-dim integral.

pab = z

4q1/2(aj e[iej])(ab)dsi = z

4i(q1/2(aj e[iej])(ab))d3x

as in the non-supersymmetric case[7], it is not dierentiable with respect to aim n . to circulmven

this diculty, we use the same trick as in [7], which stems from the construction of the hamiltonian

superalgebra complex supergravity

11

generating time translations[1]-[2]. suppose n is a scalar density of weight 1 and equals q1
outside a compact set of . so

pab = r 4[i(n aj e[iej])](ab)d3x

use the constraint eq(15), we have

= r 4[i(n e[iej])aj + n e[iej]( 1

2fij  aiaj)](ab)d3x

pab  r 4[i(n e[iej])aj + n e[iej]( 1

= r 4[i(n e[iej])aj  n e[iej]aiaj  n jd[jk]ek](ab)d3x

when taking into consideration the fallo de  r2, a  r2, , ,   r1, we have

i.e.

since the lagrangian varies as

we have on-shell that

{pab, pm n}  0

(75)

(76)

(77)

(78)

(79)

(80)

on the other hand, one can calculate l directly.using eq(39) and the invariance of lj under the
transform eq.(5), we have the variation of l under the left-handed transform eq.(5).

l = 2i(eaa

we have

(84)

therefore. we have

the independence of a, a and a implies that

(85)

(88)

to obtain the right-handed supercharge, we use the right-handed transform eq.(6) under whic

lj transforms as

lj = d(2ieaa

using the eld equation eaa  da = 0 and eq.(4), we have lj = 0. thus

this can yield that

similar to eq.(87), we have

we can easily see that qa and qa are complex conjugate to each other by comparing eq.(88) and

(95)

using the volume integral of the supercharges and the surface integral of the energy-momentum

and taking into the fall-o of the elds, one may easily obtain that

{qa, pbb } = { qa, pbb } = 0

(96)

finally, we calculate the poisson bracket of the supercharges and the su(2) charges. note that

the quantal commutator of them is [15]

6 summary and discussions

(107)

(108)

in this paper, we have obtained the angualr-momentum, supercharges and the energy-momentum

in the self-dual simple supergravity. the conservation laws possess the common feature of the

conservation laws obtained previously, i.e., the currents are identically conservative because they can

expressed as divergences of antisymmetric tensor densities which are often referred to as potentials

the total charges take the same integral forms as those in the non-supersymmetric case. though

we can obtain the su(2) sector of the sl(2, c) charges, the information of the angular-momentum

is completely contained in the su(2) charges.

it can be seen from the surface integrals that the

angular-momentum is governed by the r2 part of ei, the energy-momentum is determined by the

r0 part of ei and the r2 part of ai, and the supercharges are governed by the r2 part of i. as in

[1]-[2], we always assume that the phase space variables are subject to the boundary conditions.

i.e., they gauge covariant. their conservation is generally covariant. upon quantization, the poisson

brackets correspond to the quantal commutators or anti-commutators[18]-[19] and their algebra real-

izes indeed the super-poincare algebra. this shows that their interpertations convincing, especially

that the approaches used previously to obtain generally covariant conservation laws are reasonable.

it is novel that the relationship among the conservative quantities and the rst class constraints

is the same as the gauge charges and the constraints in the usual yang-mills gauge eld models. t

see this, consider the example of interacting yang-mills and spinor elds[20]. the lagrangian

l =

4f a

f 

a + i d  m 

is invariant under gauge transforms and this leads to the conservative noether currents

where [t a, t b] = tabct c. among the equations of motion, there are the constraints

a = tabcf

c a(x) = kf a

generating time-independent gauge transforms. the zero component of j 

a is just the the last tw

terms of the constraints. so we have the gauge charges

qa = z

a d3x = z f 0k
j 0

a dsk

(117)

i.e., it is also a surface integral modulo the constraints. the surface integral expressions of jm n , q

et al in this paper are also obtained in this way.

the supergravity considered here is an extension of the non-supersymmetric case. this can b

seen by setting the anticommuting elds to be zero. then not only the eld equations but also the

constraints reduces to the constraints in [1]-[2]. the hamiltonian constriant and the dieomorphism
constraint in [1]-[2] are implied in the constraint haa. since eq(15) which stems from eq(11) reduces
to the hamiltonian constraint

and eq(11) reduces to

thus we can say that the hamiltonian constraint and the dieomorphism constraint can be combined

together.
