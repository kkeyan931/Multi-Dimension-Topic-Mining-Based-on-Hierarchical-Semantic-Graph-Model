abstract

we study d-branes on three-dimensional orbifolds c3/ where  are nite
subgroups of su(3). the quiver diagram of zn  zn  su(3) can be ex-
pressed in three-dimensional form. according to the correspondence between
quiver diagrams and brane congurations, we construct a brane conguration
for c3/znzn which has essentially three-dimensional structrue. brane cong-
urations for nonabelian orbifolds c3/(3n2) and c3/(6n2) are obtained from
that for c3/zn  zn by certain quotienting procedure.

1 introduction

during recent years supersymmetric eld theories have been investigated using d-branes
on a singular manifold such as orbifolds and a conifold. in this setup eld theories arise as
world volume theories of the d-branes. aspects of eld theories in question are encoded in
geometric information of the singularity.

on the other hand there has been another approach of construction of supersymmetric
eld theories using branes which appear in string theory. in this framework quantities of
eld theories are determined by congurations of branes. this approach has an advantage
that aspects of eld theories can be visualized. for some cases relations between the two
approaches have been discussed, and investigations on brane congurations are also helpful
to the study of geometries around singularities probed by d-branes.

in this paper we study brane realizations of supersymmetric eld theories corresponding
to d-branes on an orbifold c3/ with  a nonabelian nite subgroup of su(3). finite
subgroups of su(3) are classied into ade like series just like the nite subgroups of
su(2). for a-type subgroups, which are abelian, d-branes on the orbifold were investigated
in [1, 2, 3, 4] and brane congurations corresponding to this case are known as brane box
models [5, 6]. for nonabelian cases, gauge groups and eld content were investigated
in [7, 8, 9]. brane congurations for d-type subgroups  = (3n2) and (6n2) were
also proposed in [10] 1. the crucial point of the construction of the conguration is the
correspondence between quiver diagrams of  and brane congurations for c3/. according
to the fact that the quiver diagram of (3n2) ((6n2)) is a z3 (s3) quotient of the quiver
diagram of zn  zn, the conguration for d-branes on c3/(3n2) (c3/(6n2)) is obtained
from the conguration for d-branes on c3/zn  zn by taking z3 (s3) quotient. in order
that the z3 quotient can be dened, brane conguration for c3/zn  zn must have z3
symmetry. in [10], the z3 symmetry was realized by a web of (p, q) 5-branes.
it is interesting to study whether similar approach can be applied to the cases in which 
are exceptional type subgroups of su(3). we can see that quiver diagrams of such subgroups
can be obtained from that of (332) by certain quotients: for instance, the quiver diagram
of an exceptional type subgroup (648) is obtained by a quotient by the tetrahedral group.
from the correspondence between quiver diagrams and brane congurations, we expect that
a brane conguration for c3/(648) is a quotient of the conguration for c3/(3  32)
by the tetrahedral group. it is however dicult to realize such a quotient on the brane
conguration for c3/(332) since it has essentially two-dimensional structure and it is not
clear how the group acts on it. the situation is similar to the case of the brane conguration
for c3/(3n2). in that case, we constructed a brane conguration for c3/zn  zn with a
z3 symmetry in order that we can dene a z3 quotient. in the present case, it would be
natural that the brane conguration for c3/(3  32) on which the tetrahedral group acts
has three-dimensional structure and manifest symmetry under the tetrahedral group.
in this paper, as a step to the construction of brane congurations corresponding to
the e-type subgroups, we propose brane conguraions for c3/(3n2) and c3/(6n2) with
three-dimensional structure. the point of the construction is to lift the quiver diagram
of zn  zn, which has essentially two-dimensional structure, into three-dimensions. the

1brane congurations for other types of nonabelian orbifolds were discussed in [11, 12].

2

conguration corresponding to this quiver diagram consists of three kinds of ns5-branes
intersecting each other and d4-branes whose three directions are bounded by ns5-branes.
naively, the conguration seems to be inappropriate since the number of supersymmetries
of the conguration is half of the number the eld theory should have: the conguration
have two supercharges while eld theories of d-branes on an orbifold c3/ with   su(3)
have four supercharges. we argue, however, that the supersymmetry of the eld theory on
d-branes is enhanced and the number of supersymmetries is the same as that of d-branes
on c3/ with   su(3). by taking quotients on the conguration, brane congurations
for c3/(3n2) and c3/(6n2) can be constructed.
the organization of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we present three-dimensional
realization of the quiver diagrams of  = znzn, (3n2) and (6n2). in section 3, we rst
review relations between quiver diagrams and brane congurations. based on the relations,
we construct brane conguration corresponding to d1-branes on orbifolds c3/zn  zn,
c3/(3n2) and c3/(6n2). we also argue the enhancement of supersymmetries of the eld
theory on d-branes. in section 4, we comment on a possibility of constructing congurations
for c3/ with  an e-type subgroup of su(3) based on the conguration for c3/(3 32)
constructed in section 3.

2 three-dimensional realization of quiver diagrams

in this section, we draw quiver diagrams of nite subgroups of su(3) in three-dimensional
form. a quiver diagram of a nite group , which consists of nodes and arrows, represents
algebraic structure of irreducible representations of ,

r3  ra = bnabrb.

(2.1)

here ra denotes irreducible representations of  and r3 is a faithful three-dimensional
representation of . each node of the quiver diagram represents each irreducible represen-
tation of  and the coecient nab is the number of arrows starting from the a-th node and
ending at the b-th node.

2.1 quiver diagrams of zn  zn
we rst present the quiver diagram of an abelian subgroup zn  zn of su(3). irreducible
representations of znzn consist of n2 one-dimensional representations r(l1,l2)
with (l1, l2) 
zn  zn. we assign an irreducible representation r(l1,l2)
to points of a two-dimensional
lattice z  z represented as

if we choose the three-dimensional representation to be

(n1, n2) = (l1 + nz, l2 + nz).

(2.4)

this equation implies that there are three arrows which start from the node (l1, l2); the
three end points are (l1 + 1, l2), (l1, l2 + 1) and (l1  1, l2  1). the quiver diagram of the
group zn  zn is depicted in figure 1.

now we redraw the quiver diagram of figure 1 in three-dimensional form. the idea is
that we consider the quiver diagram of figure 1 as a projection of a certain quiver diagram
in three-dimensional space onto a certain plane. concretely speaking, we consider a part of
the quiver diagram in figure 2(a) as a projection of a cube in figure 2(b) along a diagonal
direction of the cube.

under this consideration, the assignment (2.2) of the irreducible representations to a
to points on a three-

two-dimensional lattice z2 is translated into the assignment of r(l1,l2)
dimensional lattice z3 represented as

(n1, n2, n3) = (l1 + nz + m, l2 + nz + m, m),

where m is an integer. as indicated in figure 2(b), three arrows going from the nodes
(n1, n2, n3) have end points at (n1 + 1, n2, n3), (n1, n2 + 1, n3) and (n1, n2, n3 + 1). an
example of the quiver diagram is depicted in figure 3.

figure 3: part of the quiver diagram of zn  zn with n = 3 in three-dimensional form.

note that the quiver diagram is uniform along the direction n1 = n2 = n3, which

becomes a key point in the discussion of supersymmetry enhancement.

2.2 quiver diagrams of (3n2)

as discussed in [10], the quiver diagram of the group (3n2) is obtained by a z3 quotient
of the quiver diagram of zn  zn. the z3 acts on the label of irreducible representations
as
(2.6)

(l1, l2)  (l2, l1  l2)  (l1 + l2,l1).

if the three nodes related by the z3 action correspond to dierent representations, the
z3 quotient means that the three nodes must be identied. for instance, the three nodes
labeled by (3,1), (3,2) and (2,1) must be identied if n = 4. such nodes represent a three-
dimensional irreducible representation of (3n2). for representations invariant under the
z3 action such as r(0,0)
, the z3 quotient must be understood as a split of the node into three
nodes, each of which represents a one-dimensional irreducible representation of (3n2). the
quiver diagram of the group (3n2) is depicted in figure 4(a).

we now consider a three-dimensional realization of the quiver diagram. the idea is the
same as the two-dimensional realization of the quiver diagram. that is, the quiver diagram
of the group (3n2) is obtained by a z3 quotient of the quiver diagram of zn  zn given
in figure 3. the action of z3 on the lattice points of z3 is dened as follows.

(n1, n2, n3)  (n2, n3, n1)  (n3, n1, n2).

(2.7)

it means that z3 acts on the three-dimensional space as a 3/2 rotation along the line
specied by n1 = n2 = n3. combining with the assignment (2.5) of the irreducible repre-
sentations of zn  zn on the lattice z3, one can see that the action (2.7) is equivalent to

now we comment on the speciality when n/3 is an integer. when n/3 is not an integer,
the only xed node under the z3 action is (0, 0). on the other hand, when n/3 is an integer,
there are additional xed nodes (2n/3, n/3) and (n/3, 2n/3) as one can see from figure 5.

2.3 quiver diagrams of c3/(6n2)

the quiver diagram of the group (6n2) is obtained by a further z2 quotient on the quiver
diagram of (3n2). the z2 acts on the label of irreducible representations as

(l1, l2)  (l2, l1).

(2.8)

it means that z2 acts as a reection with respect to the line extending a diagonal direction
n1 = n2. if the two nodes related by the z2 action correspond to dierent representations,
they must be identied. for instance, the nodes (1,2) and (2,1), both of which are three-
dimensional irreducible representations of (3n2) for n = 4, must be identied. such nodes
represent six-dimensional irreducible representation of (6n2). for nodes invariant under
the z2 action, z2 acts as a split the node into a certain set of nodes. for details on the
irreducible representations of (6n2), see [10]. the quiver diagram of the group (6n2) is
depicted in figure 6(a).

in the three-dimensional version of the quiver diagram, z2 acts on a three-dimensional

(2.9)

it means that z2 acts as a reection with respect to the plane specied by n1 = n2.
combining with the z3 action (2.7), it is equivalent to the reections with respect to the
planes n2 = n3 and n3 = n1. the three-dimensional version of the quiver diagram of the
group (6n2) is depicted in figure 6(b).

3 brane cube congurations for c3/

as discussed in [6, 10], brane box type realization of d-brane gauge theory on an orbifold
c3/ has a direct correspondence to the quiver diagram of . in the d-brane gauge theory

7

on the orbifold c3/, each node in the quiver diagram corresponds to a gauge group factor
u(na) where na is the dimension of the irreducible representation. in the brane box type
realization of the gauge theory, it corresponds to a box with na d-branes. arrows in the
quiver diagram represent matter contents of the d-brane gauge theory on c3/. that is,
an arrow from the node a to the node b represents a bifundamental matter transforming
as (na, nb) under u(na)  u(nb). in the brane box type conguration, it comes from an
oriented open string starting from d-branes on the a-th box and ending on d-branes on the
b-th box. it implies that the a-th box and b-th box must adjoin each other. these two boxes
are separated by another brane, for example, ns 5-branes or (p, q) 5-branes. due to the
orientation of such branes at the boundary, only one orientation of open strings are allowed
and it induces a particular set of bifundamental matters [5]. thus the arrows in the quiver
diagram indicate how to connect boxes with d-branes. we summurize the correspondence
in table 1.

and brane box model.

it is also important that the conguration provides the same supersymmetry as that
of the d-brane gauge theory on the orbifold. several brane congurations satisfying these
reqirement were constructed. in [5, 6], a brane conguration is constructed for  = zn 
zm by using d5-branes and two kinds of ns5-branes. in [10], brane congurations were
constructed for the nonabelian groups (3n2) and (6n2) as well as the abelian group
zn  zn using (p, q) 5-branes and d3-branes.
in this section, we construct another kind of brane congurations for  = zn  zn,
(3n2) and (6n2) based on the three-dimensional version of the quiver diagrams given in
the last section.

3.1 brane cube congurations for c3/zn  zn
in this subsection, we construct brane congurations for c3/zn  zn based on the three-
dimensional version of the quiver diagram given in figure 3. as the nodes in the quiver
diagram lie at the lattice points of z3, boxes also lie at the lattice points of z3. the node at
(n1, n2, n3) is connected to the nodes at (n1 +1, n2, n3), (n1, n2 +1, n3) and (n1, n2, n3 +1) in
the quiver diagram by three outgoing arrows, so the box at (n1, n2, n3) must adjoin boxes at
(n1 + 1, n2, n3), (n1, n2 + 1, n3) and (n1, n2, n3 + 1). a natural brane conguration satisfying
these requirement is depicted in figure 7. note that the cube at (n1, n2, n3) has the same
label as the cube at (n1 + 1, n2 + 1, n3 + 1).

the conguration consists of the following branes:

figure 7: the brane cube conguration for c3/znzn with n = 3. the cube at (n1, n2, n3)
has the same label as the cube at (n1 + 1, n2 + 1, n3 + 1).

 ns5-branes located along 012345 directions.
 ns5-branes located along 012367 directions.
 ns5-branes located along 014567 directions.
 d4-branes located along 01246 directions.
d4-branes are bounded in the direction 6 by the ns5-branes, in the direction 4 by the
ns5-branes, and in the direction 2 by the ns5-branes. thus the non-compact directions of
the d4-branes are 0 and 1, and hence the low energy theory becomes two-dimensional. the
numbers written in the boxes are the labels of the irreducible representations of zn  zn.
due to the orientation of ns5-branes, only one orientation of open strings is allowed and
it gives a bifundamental matter corresponding to the arrow of the quiver diagram.

there is however a subtlety on the number of supersymmetries. the conguration
consists of four kinds of branes, each of which breaks 1/2 supersymmetries. thus the brane
cube conguration has two supercharges. since the number of supersymmetries of the gauge
theory of d-branes on c3/ with   su(3) is four, it seems that the two gauge theories
have dierent numbers of supersymmetries. as we will discuss, however, the low energy
eld theory of d-branes obtained from the brane cube conguration has an enough number
of supersymmetries due to a certain enhancement of supersymmetry.

to explain the supersymmetry enhancement, we derive the brane cube conguration
it is obtained from d1-branes on c4/ by performing t-
from dierent point of view.
duality three times. in fact, a similar but dierent conguration were discussed in [13, 14].
both of them have a property that the conguration is uniform along one direction. it is
the key point of the supersymmetry enhancement.

we start with the d1-brane gauge theory on c4/ with  an abelian subgroup of su(4)
[15, 13]. we consider || d1-branes on c4 and let the d1-branes extend along 01 directions.
the low energy eective action of the d1-brane is given by the dimensional reduction of
ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric u(||) yang-mills theory to two dimensions. the
theory contains gauge eld a, four complex scalar elds z  ( = 1, 2, 3, 4), eight left-handed
fermions  and eight right-handed fermions +. these elds transforms in the adjoint of

9

u(||). then we project the theory onto  invariant states. to perform the projection, one
must dene how  acts on c4. this is specied by a four-dimensional representation r4.
we denote the decomposition of r4 into irreducible representations ra (a = 1, . . . ,||) of
 as
(3.1)

r4 = ra1  ra2  ra3  ra4.

(as  is abelian, its irreducible representations are one-dimensional.) each irreducible
representation ra acts on the coordinates z of c4 as z  raz. the requirement that
 is a subgroup of su(4) can be stated as

ra1  ra2  ra3  ra4 = r0

(3.2)

if we write ra  rb = rab, the condition is
where r0 is the trivial representation.
represented as ra4 = ra1a2a3. to dene d-branes on c4/, one must also determine
how  acts on the chan-paton indices. we dene the action of  on the chan-paton
indices as the regular representation of . note that the theory obtained by the projection
is a two-dimensional (0,2) supersymmetric theory with the gauge group u(1)|| = au(1)a,
where u(1)a represents the gauge group u(1) corresponding to the representation ra.

the eld content surviving the projection is as follows:

 a gauge eld aa of u(1)a,
 four complex bosons z 
 a left-handed dirac fermion a which transform in the adjoint of u(1)a,
 three left-handed dirac fermions 

a which transforms in the ( ,

 four right-handed dirac fermions

+a which transforms in the ( ,

where a runs from 1 to ||. here 
a is antisymmetric in , so there are six elds to each a,
three of which are independent. there is an ambiguity to determine the three independent
left-handed dirac fermions. we take three elds i4

a (i = 1, 2, 3) be independent.

these elds form (0,2) multiplets as follows 2:

 the gauge eld aa and the left-handed fermion a and an auxiliary eld da form a

one obtain two-dimensional (2,2) supersymmetric gauge theory. thus although the brane
cube conguration has only two supercharges the two-dimensional eld theory on d-branes
has an enough number of supersymmetries.

to understand the reason for the supersymmetry enhancement, it is useful to compare
the conguration of figure 7 with a brane conguration obtained by another t-duality. as
noted earlier, there is an ambiguity to choose three directions to perform t-duality out of
four complex coordinates. if we t-dualize along three compact directions associated with
z1, z2 and z4, we obtain a brane cube conguration depicted in figure 10.

we would like to emphasize that the two congurations in figure 8 and figure 10 give
the same eld theory since both of them are related to the d-branes on c4/ by t-dualities
and hence the two congurations are related by t-duality.

in the brane cube conguration given in figure 10, the cube at (n1, n2, n3) and the cube
at (n1, n2, n3 + 1) are equivalent. if we set ra4 = r0, the (2,2) chiral multiplets 1
a and

a can be represented by arrows with components (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and (1,1,1), while
the (2,2) vector multiplet va can be represented by an arrow with components (0, 0, 1). this
is the model considered in section 3.2 of [13]. that is, if we take  = z3  z3, ra1 = r(1,0)
,
ra2 = r(0,1)

, we obtain the conguration in figure 12.

figure 12: the brane cube conguration for c3/znzn with n = 3 obtained by t-dualities
along 2,4,8 directions. it is uniform along the direction 8.

in the conguration of figure 12, we can remove ns5-branes extending along 012345
directions without changing the matter contents and gauge groups since the conguration
of figure 12 is trivial along the direction 8. the resulting conguration is equivalent (up
to a certain t-duality) to the usual brane box model [5, 6] with two kinds of ns5-branes.
therefore the eld theory obtained from the conguration in figure 12 is equivalent to the
eld theory obtained from the usual brane box model, so the eld theory has four super-
charges. as stated above, the conguration of figure 7 is related to figure 12 t-duality,
the eld theory realized by the conguration has the enough number of supersymmetries.
note that the conguration of figure 7 is more natural than that of figure 12 in the
sense that the three coordinates of c3 (three chiral multiplets i) are treated equivalently.
this is the key point of the construction of the conguration for c3/(3n2). due to the
symmetric assignment of the multiplets, however, enhancement of supersymmetry becomes
rather nontrivial.

3.2 brane cube congurations for c3/(3n2)
the brane conguration for the orbifold c3/(3n2) is obtained from that for c3/zn  zn
by a z3 quotient. the z3 acts as a 2/3 rotation along the line x2 = x4 = x6. the brane
conguration is given in figure 13.

the reason that the conguration gives the structure of the irreducible representations
of (3n2) is the same as in [10]. the gauge group coming from each box depend on whether
the box include xed points of the z3 action. when n/3 is not an integer, only the boxes
with index (0,0) include xed line of the z3 action. when n/3 is an integer, the boxes with
indices (2n/3, n/3) and (n/3, 2n/3) also include xed lines in addition to (0,0). for such
boxes, we must take a z3 quotient, which leads the gauge group to be u(1)3 since the gauge
eld on the box takes the following form,



a1 a2 a3
a3 a1 a2
a2 a3 a1

a 

.




(3.23)

it implies that such boxes correspond to a sum of three one-dimensional representations
of (3n2). on the other hand, for the boxs which do not include the xed lines of the

the brane cube conguration in figure 7 by a z3 quotient. z3 acts as a 2/3 rotation along
the line x2 = x4 = x6.

z3 action, three d-branes simply pile up and give the gauge group u(3). it implies that
such boxes correspond to three-dimensional irreducible representations of (3n2). one can
see that the quotienting procedure precicely reproduces the structure of the irreducible
representations of (3n2). we can also verify that matter contents obtained after the z3
quotient coincide with those specied by the quiver diagram of (3n2).

3.3 brane cube congurations for c3/(6n2)

the brane conguration for the orbifold c3/(6n2) is obtained from that for c3/(3n2) by
a z2 quotient. the z2 acts as a reection with respect to the plane x2 = x4 as indicated in
the quiver diagram of (6n2) in figure 6(b). combining with the z3 identication for the
conguration corresponding to c3/(3n2), it is equivalent to the reections with respect
to the planes x4 = x6 and x6 = x2. the brane conguration is given in figure 14. one can
verify that the conguration reproduces the structure of the quiver diagrams of (6n2).
for details on the structure of the irreducible representations, see [10].

4 discussions

in this paper, we have proposed brane cube congurations corresponding to d1-branes on
nonabelian orbifolds c3/ with   su(3). this is based on the three-dimensional version
of the quiver diagrams of . the conguration consists of three kinds of ns5-branes and
d4-branes. since the d4-branes are bounded by ns5-branes along three directions, the low
energy theory becomes two-dimensional. due to the fact that the conguration is uniform
along a diagonal direction, supersymmetry of the eld theory is enhanced twice as many as
naively expected.

the original motivation to consider congurations with three-dimensional structure
comes from the study of congurations for an orbifold c3/ with  an e-type subgroup of
su(3). as mentioned in introduction, the quiver diagram of (648) is a quotient of the
quiver diagram of (3  32) by the tetrahedral group. according to the correspondence
between quiver diagrams and brane congurations for c3/, we expect that a brane cong-
uration for c3/(648) is obtained from the conguration for c3/(3  32) given in figure
13 by taking a quotient by the tetrahedral group. in fact, the conguration in figure 13
has structure of the tetrahedral group: the conguration consists of cubes, which are in
a sence dual to tetrahedra, so we can dene an action of the tetrahedral group on the
conguration. it is now under investigation whether such a quotient actually reproduces
required properties of the gauge theories.

finally we would like to compare the congurations in this paper with those given in
[10]. the conguration given in [10] consists of a web of (p, q) 5-branes and d3-branes.
as the d3-branes are bounded along two-directions by (p, q) 5-branes, they provide two-
dimensional eld theory, which coincides with the brane cube congurations. thus it
seems that we should start with d1-branes on c4/  c3/  c to realize z3 symmetry
of brane congurations. from this viewpoint, the fact that the brane box model gives
four-dimensional theory is owing to the speciality of the abelian case in which an explicit
z3 symmetry is not necessary.

as we have discussed, the congurations given in [10] have esentially two-dimensional
structure, while the brane cube congurations are three-dimensional. it is interesting to
see whether there is a relation like duality between the two types of congurations. if such
a relation can be found, it may be possible to construct brane congurations corresponding
to c3/ with  an e-type subgroup based on the brane congurations made out of a web
of (p, q) 5-branes.

in [10], it was also argued that the brane congurations are dual to toric diagrams of
c3/ and that three-dimensional mckay correspondence [17]-[20] may be understood as
t-duality. we hope that the three-dimensional version of the quiver diagrams and the
brane cube congurations provide some hints on investigations along these lines.
