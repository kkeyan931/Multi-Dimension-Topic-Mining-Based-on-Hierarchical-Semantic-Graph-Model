abstract

we consider systems of dp branes in the presence of a nonzero b eld. we
study the corresponding supergravity solutions in the limit where the branes world-
volume theories decouple from gravity. these provide dual descriptions of large n
noncommutative gauge theories. we analyse the phase structure of the theories and
the validity of the dierent description. we provide evidence that in the presence
of a nonzero b eld the worldvolume theory of d6 branes decouples from gravity.
we analyse the systems of m5 branes and ns5 branes in the presence of a nonzero
c eld and nonzero rr elds, respectively. finally, we study the wilson loops
(surfaces) using the dual descriptions.

introduction

the ads/cft correspondence (see [1] for a review) relates eld theories without gravity
to supergravity (string) theories on certain curved backgrounds. the correspondence
naturally arises when considering dp branes in a limit where the worldvolume eld theory
decouples from the bulk gravity [2]. as discussed in [3] and further studied in [4], when
turning on a b eld on the d-brane worldvolume the low energy eective worldvolume
theory is deformed to a noncommutative super yang-mills (ncsym) theory. with n
coinciding dp branes in the presence of a nonzero b eld the worldvolume theory is
deformed to a u(n) ncsym [5].

turning on a b eld on the d-brane worldvolume can be viewed via the ads/cft
correspondence as a perturbation of the worldvolume eld theory by a higher dimension
operator. the noncommutative eects are relevant in the uv and are negligible in the ir.
in fact, there is a map from the commutative eld theory variables to the noncommutative
ones [5]. as in the cases with b = 0, there exists a limit where the bulk gravity decouples
from the worldvolume noncommutative eld theory [6, 5], and a correspondence between
string theory on curved backgrounds with b eld and noncommutative eld theories is
expected. the aim of this paper is to study this correspondence using dp branes, m5
branes and ns5 branes. related works along this directions are [7, 8, 9]. other recent
studies of nocommutative eld theories and string theory are [10].

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we will review the eect of a b eld on
the worldvolume theory of branes. we will discuss the dp branes supergravity solutions in
the presence of a b eld, the decoupling limit and various aspects of the correspondence
with the noncommutative worldvolume eld theories. we will analyse the phase structure
of the dp branes and plot their phase diagrams. we will see that the structure can vary
depending on the rank of the b eld, i.e. depending on the number of noncommutative
coordinates. we will argue that, unlike the b = 0 case, in the presence of a nonzero b
eld there is a limit where the worldvolume theory of dp branes with p > 5 decouples from
gravity. in particular, for d6 branes we will see that with two noncommutative coordinates
we have for nite n a uv description in terms of eleven dimensional supergravity on a
curved space. for four or six noncommutative coordinates we nd for nite n a uv
description in terms of ten dimensional supergravity on a curved space.

in section 3 we will discuss m5 branes in the presence of a nonzero c eld and ns5
branes in the presence of nonzero rr elds. in the case of m5 branes wrapping a circle
we will see the same decoupling limit discussed in [5] arising from supergravity. however,
in the uv the good description of this system is in terms of d4 branes background, and
we do not nd a six dimensional eld theory description. considering m5 branes with
six at nocompact worldvolume coordinates we curiously nd another decoupling limit.
at low energies the supergravity background is of the form ads7  s4 with a self-dual
c eld which is the dual description of the (0, 2) theory. as we increase the energy the
background is deformed and the c eld is no longer self-dual. in section 4 we will use the
dual description in order to compute wilson loops and wilson surfaces for the dierent

brane theories. we will show that, in some cases, in the presence of the nonzero b (c)
eld there is way to x the string (membrane) end point (string) by considering a moving
coordinates frame in the computation. section 5 is devoted to a discussion.

2 dp branes in constant b eld

2.1 b eld background

consider string theory in at space in the background of constant ns b eld and dp
branes. in this set up, the end points of the open strings attached to the branes, xi, are
noncommuting [11]:

[xi, xi+1] = il2

(1)

we will study this system in the limit bi,i+1   and ls  0 such that bi  l2
xed. rescaling the coordinates xi  bi
limit we get [xi, xi+1] = ibi.

sbi,i+1 is
xi and keeping the new coordinates xed in the

l2
s

in the presence of the b eld, the massless states excitations of the open strings
attached to the dp branes give rise to a noncommutative worldvolume eld theories, with
bi being the deformation parameters. the mode expansions of the open strings coordinates
and momenta are:

x i(,  ) = xi + pi + bi

where pi  l2

pi is rescaled in order to preserve the canonical commutator relations.

as we see in (3), there is a nite part added to the string end point, which is pro-
portional to the momentum. physically it means that the open strings attached to a
mixed brane are dipoles of the worldvolume u(n) gauge theory [12, 13] and this, in
part, is a reection of the non-locality in these theories. the moment of these dipoles are
proportional to bipi+1.

2.2 the string (supergravity) description

in the following we will discuss the dual formulation of noncommutative gauge theories
as string (supergravity) theory on curved backgrounds with a non-zero b eld. consider
now the supergravity description of dp branes in the presence of a non-zero b eld. such
solutions were written in [15, 7, 8]. it is straightforward to write the most general solutions.

2

since we can gauge away the non-zero components of the b eld that are normal to the
worldvolume of the branes, the relevant cases are those with non-zero components of the
b eld parallel to the branes. we denote by 2m, m = 1,   , [ p+1
2 ], the rank of the b eld.
the space-time coordinates are x1, ..., xd and we denote by xp+1 the time direction 2. the
supergravity background takes the form 3

we dene two scales which will be useful for the discussion in the following sections.

2.3 phase diagrams

summarizing the above discussion, the eective dimensionless expansion parameters of
the dp branes system in the background of non-zero b elds are the number of branes n,
the eective gauge coupling gef f and the eective noncommutativity parameters aef f
, i =
1, 3, ..., 2m  1. for each dp brane we can plot a phase diagram as a function of these
dimensionsless parameters. dierent regions of these phase diagrams will have a good
description in terms of dierent variables. such analysis when b = 0 was done in [16].

d2 branes

consider the supergravity solution of n d2-branes in the presence of b eld (6). in

this case m = 1, only the b12 component is non-zero. thus,

where b12 is the b eld scaled in accord with the coordinates rescaling. when aef f  1
the noncommutativity eects are small and we have a good description in terms of a
commutative eld theory. this is valid at low energies u  ( g2

)1/5.

ef f  g2

consider the ow from high energies to low energies. the eective dimensionless
coupling (9) is now g2
y m nb/u. when gef f  1 we have a good description in terms
of noncommutative n = 8 perturbative noncommutative super yang-mills (ncsym).
the energy range for this description to be valid is u  g2
y m nb. when gef f  1, that is
u  g2
y m nb, we have a transition to the type iia supergravity description. the type
iia supergravity description is valid when both the curvature in string units (8) and the
eective string coupling (12) are small. this implies large n (or large noncommutativity
parameter aef f ). when the eective string coupling is large the good description is in
terms of an eleven dimensional theory. this description is obtained by uplifting the d2
brane solution (17) to eleven dimensions. when uplifting to eleven dimensions we can
distinguish two cases. in the rst case the eective string coupling becomes large before
the nocommutative eects can be neglected while in the second case it becomes large after
the nocommutative eects become negligible. it is convenient to dene a dimensionless
parameter  which is the ratio between the energy scale at which the eective string
coupling is of order one while the nocommutative eects are negligible and the energy
scale at which the dimensionless noncommutative parameter aef f is of order one. it reads
 = g4
y m b3. then the rst case corresponds to   1 and the second case to   1.
finally, at energies u  g2
y m b the good description is in terms of the eleven dimensional
m2 branes background. in gure 1 we plot the transition between the dierent descriptions
as a function of the energy scale u. we see the ow from n = 8 ncsym at high energy
to n = 8 scft at low energy.

the nocommutative eects become signicant while in the second case it becomes large
after the nocommutative eects become signicant. the the ratio between the energy

eects become large and the eective string coupling decreases. it becomes small again at
energies u  g10/3
y m n 1/3b1/3 and we have a good description by the type iia supergravity
background.
in gure 2 we plot the transition between the dierent descriptions as a
function of the energy scale u. finally, when   1 we do not have to up lift to eleven
dimensions. the reason being that the eective string coupling is kept small by the large
noncommutative eects. this is described in gure 3.

string coupling is large the good description is in terms of an s-dual ten dimensional

large before the nocommutative eects become signicant while in the second case it

the case of m = 3 is similar to to the m = 2 case and we will briey discuss it. we
consider the euclidean signature and again assume b1 = b3 = b5 = b. it is again convenient
to dene the dimensionless parameter  which now reads  = 1

which the transitions occur are modied.

d6 branes

with a vanishing b eld the worldvolume theory of n d6 branes of type iia string
theory does not decouple from the bulk. this can be seen, for instance, by the fact that in
the decoupling limit we keep g2
s = f ixed as ls  0. this means that the eleven
dimensional planck length lp = g1/3

ls is kept xed and that gravity does not decouple.

consider now n d6 branes of type iia in the presence of a b eld. in this case the
rank of the b eld can be up to six, m = 1, 2, 3. the eective string coupling (13) at large
u reads e  u(32m)/4. when m = 1 we expect to have an eleven dimensional description
in the uv. note that in the decoupling limit we keep gsl32m
= f ixed as ls  0. therefor
for m = 1 the the eleven dimensional planck length lp  0 and we expect gravity to
decouple. for m = 2, 3 the eective string coupling is small at all energy scales and there
is no need for an eleven dimensional description at high energy. the ten dimensional
planck scale l(10)
ls  0 and we expect gravity to decouple. in the following we
will analyse the phase diagram of the d6 branes system.

since the eleven dimensional planck length goes to zero in the decoupling limit we expect
gravity to decouple from the branes worldvolume theory. thus, it is plausible that a seven
dimensional worldvolume theory without gravity does exist.

when   1 the phase diagram is similar, however the transition to eleven dimensions
occurs at u  n b

eleven dimensional supergravity solution can be trusted in the uv for any n. in gure 8

powers of 10 = gsl4

the interaction terms to vanish in this limit and gravity to decouple from the branes
worldvolume theory. thus, it is plausible to expect that a seven dimensional worldvolume
theory without gravity does exist.
it was noted in [8] that such a theory will have a
negative specic heat.

the case m = 3 is similar to to the m = 2 case and we will briey discuss it. we
assume b1 = b3 = b5 = b. it is again convenient to dene the dimensionless parameter
 which now reads  = 1
y m b3 . the phase diagram for the cases   1 and   1 are
similar to the m = 2 case above. the energy scales at which the transitions occur are
modied. as for the m = 2 case, the scalar curvature vanishes at large u, however, the
metric at large u is not at. the decoupling from the bulk argument is as in the m = 2
case.

dp branes (p > 6)

consider now the decoupling limit for dp branes with p > 6. in a ten dimensional de-
scription the interaction lagrangian between the brane modes and gravity is proportional
to positive powers of 10 = gsl4
in an eleven dimensional description the interaction
s.
is proportional to positive powers of the eleven dimensional planck length lp. consider
rst the d7 branes. in the decoupling limit we hold gsl42m
xed as ls  0. therefor,

s

13

when m > 0 we see that 10  0 in this limit, which indicates that the worldvolume
theory decouples from gravity. in the d8 branes case we hold gsl52m
xed as ls  0.
again, when m > 0 we see that 10  0 in this limit. when m = 1 the eective string
coupling is small in the uv and the ten dimensional description is sucient. when m > 1
the eective string coupling is large in the uv and we will need an eleven dimensional
description. note that lp  0 when m > 1 which indicates that again gravity decouples
from the brane worldvolume theory. for d9 branes we hold gsl42m
xed as ls  0 which
ensures again that 10  0 and indicates the decoupling of gravity.

2.4 non extremal dp branes

case without a b eld. later we will analyse the wilson loops of this system.

in this section we will discuss possible noncommutative deformations of the m5 branes
and ns5 branes worldvolume theories.

at low energies compared to 1/r0 the description of the system is in terms of the d4 brane
theory, as discussed in the previous section. we might have expected that at high energies
(large u) we will have a good description in terms of a noncommutative (0, 2) theory in

the background becomes that of wrapped m5 branes. as we increase the energy we can
trust the ns5 branes background which provides a deformation of the wrapped m5 branes
background.

4 wilson loops

in this section will use the dual string description in order to compute wilson loops
(surfaces) for the dierent brane theories.

4.1 dp branes

according to the ads/cft correspondence, the expectation value of the wilson loop
operator of the gauge theory can be computed in the dual string description by evaluating
the partition function of a string whose worldsheet in bounded by the loop [18, 19]. in
the supergravity approximation the dominant contribution comes from the minimal two
dimensional surface bounded by the loop. the expectation value of the wilson loop
operator is

hw (c)i  es ,

18

(39)

where s is the string action evaluated on the minimal surface. we will use the same
prescription in the case of a nonzero b eld. the string action reads now

s =

1

2l2

s z d dqdetgij +

1

s z bij x ix j,

2l2

(40)

where gij = ix jx g is the induced metric.

consider a static q q conguration. in general the quark and antiquark move with
velocity p = b
p. when b = 0, in the ls  0 limit, the velocity appears via a multiplicative
l2
s
factor in q q potential, as expected by the lorentz symmetry. when b 6= 0 the situation
is dierent. there is no lorentz symmetry and the b eld term contributes. when the
strings are not moving the end points of strings cannot be xed at a nite distance l
from each other at large u [8] since they grow with u. the endpoints of the strings can
be xed at large u as follows. as was noted in [12], the interaction of charges of opposite
sign in a magnetic eld is nonlocal in the sense that the interaction point in terms of the
center of mass coordinate is shifted by a momentum dependent term. this suggests that
we should use a moving coordinates frame in the computation 6. indeed, as seen from
(3), the end points of the open strings attached to the boundary are quark and anti-quark
moving with the same velocity (3).

in the following we will consider dp branes with bi = b, i = 1, 3, ..., 2m  1. however
we will write the nal result for arbitrary bi. we distinguish two cases. in the rst case
the rank of the b eld is not maximal, thus some of the coordinates are commutative
and the loop is parametrized by these. in this case the computation proceeds exactly as
in the b = 0 case. in the second case the loop is parametrized by the noncommutative
coordinates. we will discuss this case. we parametrize the string conguration by t =
, u = , x1 = p, x2 = x(u). equation (40) reads now

s =

(42)

(43)

6we note that in the case m = p+1

2 we will not be able to x the end points of the strings at innity.
in this case, the time coordinate xp+1 is noncommutative coordinate. for a static conguration where
the potential is time independent we cannot nd an appropriate shift of the time coordinate.

therefor if we choose the constant in (43) to be p

when p < 5 the potential is attractive. when p = 5 l is independent of u0 and the

to l2 which results in a repulsive force. the potential (50) is the same as in the b = 0

in order to compute the expectation value of the wilson loop operator in the gauge theory
at nonzero temperature we will use the non-extremal dp branes background. we again
take the previous string conguration. we get

4.3 wilson surfaces

the computation of the expectation value of a wilson surface observable amounts in the
supergravity approximation to computing the minimal volume of a membrane bounded
at innity by the surface . consider rst the wrapped m5 branes background (25).

m = 1

when the noncommutative eects are large the background (25) has three small co-
ordinates x1, x2, x5. there are two cases to distinguish. the rst is when the membrane
wraps one of this coordinates. in this case the result should coincide with that of the d4
branes wilson loop computation. the second case is when the membrane is not wrapping

21

one of these small coordinates. this case is similar to the computation of the potential
between monopole and antimonopole. here we expect an end xing problem since unlike
the electric charges in the b eld background there is no useful moving coordinate frame.

we start with the rst case. we denote the membrane coordinates by , 1, 2. con-
01 = x5, 2 = u, x2  x(u) and x1 = p .

sider , for instance, the conguration  = x6, b r2
1 parametrizes the compactication circle 0  1  2. the membrane action reads

s =

1

(2)2 z d d1du(s(1  h1 p2)(1 + (

u3

nb r2
0

)h1(ux)2) +

p
b

(au)3h1ux) , (56)

where here h = 1 + a3u3. performing the integration on 1 we get (41) for p = 4, where
r3  nb r2

0. this is th expected result.

consider the second case and let the conguration be  = x6, 1 = x3, 2 = u, x4 
x(u). since the c346 component is nonzero, the c term in the membrane action contributes
and we get the action per unit length

s =

1

42b r2

0 z d du(sh(1 + (

u3

nb r2

)(ux)2) +

a3
b

u3ux) .

(57)

the equation of motion for x(u) at large u is of the form ux  const, and we have an end
xing problem. as we noted above, a similar end xing problem arises when considering
the a d2 brane ending on d4 branes in order to compute the monopole antimonopole
potential when b 6= 0.

m = 2

the computation here is similar to the m = 1 case when the membrane is wrapping
01 = x5, 2 = u, x2  x(u) and

a small coordinate. taking the conguration  = x6, b r2
x1 = p , and integrating the action with respect to  we get (56).

finally, consider the background (30). when the noncommutative eects are large the
background (30) has three small coordinates x1, x2, x5. again we distinguish two types of
membrane conguration. the rst is when the membrane wraps one of this coordinates.
a conguration like this is  = x6, 1 = x1, 2 = u, x2  x(u) and x1 = p . the membrane
action per unit length reads

(62)

this is the same result as for the wilson surface in the b = 0 case [18].

the second case is when the membrane is not wrapping one of these small coordinates.
here we expect an end xing problem. indeed consider the conguration  = x6, 1 =
x3, 2 = u, x4  x(u). the membrane action per unit length reads

s =

1

(2)2 z d dusu2h(1 + (

(63)

writing the equation of motion for x(u) we see that ux at large u goes like like u and we
have an end xing problem.

5 discussion

in this paper we studied the dp branes supergravity solutions in the presence of a b
eld, the decoupling limit and various aspects of the correspondence with the noncom-
mutative worldvolume eld theories. we analysed the phase structure of the dp branes
and its dependence on the rank of the b eld, i.e. the dependence on the number of
noncommutative coordinates. we provided evidence for the existence of decoupled dp
branes worldvolume theories when p  6 in presence of a nonzero b eld. the relevance
of this to m(atrix) theory compactication on the tori t p, p  6 in the presence of a
nonzero b eld deserves a further study. as pointed out [8] the d6 branes system has a
negative specic heat. this is usually taken as a sign of instability. however, it may be
that the noncommutative eects at high energy require a modication of our eld theory
understanding of thermal equilibrium. this requires further studies too.

we discussed m5 branes in the presence of nonzero c eld. in the case of m5 branes
wrapping a circle we found the same decoupling limit discussed in [5] arising from su-
pergravity.
in the uv the good description of this system is in terms of d4 branes
background, and we did not nd a six dimensional eld theory description. considering
m5 branes with six at nocompact worldvolume coordinates we found another decoupling

23

limit and we discussed this possible deformation of the (0, 2) scft. we also discussed
type iib and type iia ns5 branes (wrapping a circle) in the presence of nonzero rr
elds.

finally we computed the expectation value of the wilson loop (surface) operators using
the dual supergravity description. we have seen that, in some cases, in the presence of
the nonzero b (c) eld there is a way to x the string (membrane) end point (string)
by considering a moving coordinates frame in the computation. the results for both
extremal and non-extremal dp branes (and for the m5 branes) are the same as in the
b = 0 case with g2
i odd bi. this is presumably expected by the map from
noncommutative gauge theories to the commutative ones [5].
