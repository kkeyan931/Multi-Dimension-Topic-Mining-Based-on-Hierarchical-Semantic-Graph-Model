1. in this note several comments on the beta function in supersymmetric gauge theories will be
made in the light of the recent literature on the subject [1, 2, 3, 4]. the bare lagrangian of an
n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with generic matter content is given by

and g(m ) and (m ) stand for the bare coupling constant and vacuum parameter, m being the
ultraviolet cuto. by a generalized nonrenormalization theorem [5] the eective lagrangian at scale
 has the form,

novikov et. al. used then the 1pi eective action to dene a physical coupling constant for

which they obtained the well known nvsz beta function (eq.(13) below) [6].

recently the derivation of the nvsz beta function was substantially claried by arkani-hamed
and murayama [1, 2]. (see also [3].) they work entirely in the framework of the wilsonian eective
action (hence no subtleties due to zero momentum external lines, such as those leading to apparent
violation of nonrenormalization theorem[5, 7]). they insist simply that at each infrared cuto 
the matter kinetic terms be re-normalized so that it resumes the standard canonical form. thus by
introducing

and by taking into account the appropriate anomalous jacobian [8], one gets

(9)

is the anomalous dimension of the ith matter eld. the same result follows by dierentiating (7)
with respect to m with  xed, and by using (gh(m )) = +m d

dm log zi(, m ).

the holomorphic coupling constant gh() is a perfectly good denition of the eective coupling
constant:
it is nite as m  ;  = nite, and physics below  can be computed in terms of
it. on the contrary, the coecient of w aw a in (3) is not a good denition of an eective coupling
constant, as long as nf 6= 0: it is divergent in the limit the ultraviolet cuto is taken to innity.
let us note that, in spite of its name, the holomorphic coupling constant gets renormalized in a
non-holomorphic way, due to the fact that zi(, m ) is real.

finally, in order to have the canonical form of gauge kinetic terms, f f /4, one must perform

a further change of the variables,

a = gcac ,

(10)

and the corresponding rescaling of the gaugino eld (x), to preserve supersymmetry. this intro-
duces as functionalintegral jacobian an extra factor [2],

exp

82 w aw a + h.c.

and as a consequence, leads to the change of the coupling constant [10],

the nsvz beta function [6] follows then from (12) and (8):

(11)

(12)

(13)

an important point of [2] is the fact that the wilsonian coupling constant, whether holomorphic
or canonical, contains higher loop perturbative corrections in general; the often stated one-loop
(perturbative) exactness of the wilsonian eective coupling constant is valid only in particular cases,
e.g., for the holomorphic coupling constant in the n = 1 supersymmetric pure yang-mills theory.

the above procedure nicely explains the origin of the denominator of the nsvz beta
2.
function. in the case of n = 1 pure yang-mills theory the latter has led to an interesting conjecture
[9]. however, it also leads to a new puzzle. in fact, the right hand side of (12) has a minimum at
g2
c = 82/nc, precisely corresponding to the pole of the nsvz beta function, where it takes the
value,

,

(14)

nc
82 log

82e
nc

which is positive unless nc is rather large (i.e., unless nc  215). on the contrary the left hand side
of (12) evolves down to zero if the beta function has no zero (nf < 3nc/2). thus for large values
of gh (gh > 82/nc log(82e/nc)) the redenition (12), with a real canonical coupling constant,
is not allowed.

2

since this problem occurs for any nf such that nf < 3nc/2, let us for simplicity consider the
case of the pure yang mills theory (nf = 0) and compare the rg evolution in the two coupling
constants. in this case, h(gh) is a pure one-loop eect, so that rg equation can be integrated in a
closed form:

1
h() 
2g2

3nc
162 log  = {indep. of }  

3nc
162 log  ,

(which denes ) namely,

1

gh()2 =

3nc
82 log




,

which evolves to the infrared and vanishes at  = .

on the other hand, if one integrates

one gets

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

by using the same  as in eq.(16). the problem with (19) is that gc() does not run down to
 = ; it runs only down to

0 =

82e

nc

>  ,

(20)

(for 82e > nc), which corresponds to the pole of the nvsz beta function.

also, (19) apparently suggests the presence of another branch in which the coupling constant gc

grows in the ultraviolet [9].

actually both the absence of evolution below the scale 82e/nc and the apparent new phase
of the theory are probably artefacts caused by the illegitimate change of variable (12). the pole
c = 82/nc is then simply a sign of the failure of gc as a coupling constant (and ac (x) as a
at g2
functional variable), a sort of a singularity of parametrization, rather than of physics itself.

this however means that if one starts at high energies by using the standard canonical coupling
constant and studies the rg evolution towards the low energies, one must switch to the holomor-
phic description at certain point (in any case, before the critical value g2
c = 82/nc is reached),
in order to describe the physics smoothly down to  = . the impossibility of writing a low en-
ergy eective lagrangian with canonically normalized gauge kinetic terms, does not represent any
inconsistency since the low energy physical degrees of freedom are in fact described by some gauge-
invariant composite elds, and not by gauge elds themselves. the latter uctuate violently while
the appropriate variables behave more smoothly. for nf  nc, the appropriate low energy degrees
of freedom are mesonlike composite elds mij = qiqj;1 for nf = nc + 1 they are the mesons and
1as is well known sqcd with nf < nc does not have well dened vacua if quarks are massless: we assume that
all quark masses are small but nonvanishing. in the case nf = nc = n, the low energy degrees of freedom contains
the baryon b = a1a2...an i1i2 ...in qa1

and b dened analogously in terms of q s, as well.)

baryons; for nc + 1  nf  3nc the low energy degrees of freedom are dual quarks and free
mesons [11]. in particular, in the conformal window, i.e. for 3nc/2  nf  3nc, the low energy
theory admits two dual equivalent descriptions, one in terms of the original quarks and gluons of
su (nc) gauge theory, another in terms of su (nf nc) gauge theory with nf avors of dual quarks.
at larger values of nf (nf > 3nc) the low energy degrees of freedom are the original quarks and
gluons, but since the theory is infrared free no obstruction arises against describing them by using
the canonical coupling constant at all scales.

the success of the nsvz beta function in the case of sqcd in the conformal window (3nc/2 <

nf < 3nc) [11], especially the determination of the anomalous dimension of the matter elds,

 =

3nc  nf

nf

,

(21)

at the infrared xed point, is consistent with the use of the holomorphic coupling constant (eq.(8)).
it does neither require the use of the canonical coupling constant nor necessitate the form of the
original nsvz beta function. this is important because the anomalous dimension at the ir xed
point is a physically observable number.

one might wonder how exact all this is.

3.
generalized nonrenormalization theorem of [5] is valid only within perturbation theory.

it is clear that the diagrammatic proof of the

it was argued on the other hand in [2] that due to the existence of an anomalous ur(1) symmetry
the beta functions are purely perturbative, hence the nsvz beta function is exact perturbatively and
nonperturbatively, at least for pure n = 1 yangmills theory. in fact, the (holomorphic) coupling
constant at scale m

must satisfy

where t  log m

h(gh) = (d/d log m ) gh(m )|gh(m  )

shares the same property. together with the periodicity in  with period 2, one nds that

(22)

(23)

(24)

where an is the n- instanton contribution. since the right hand side is independent of  it must
consists only of the perturbative term, n = 0.

this argument is however only valid in theories in which cp invariance is not spontaneously
broken. examples are the pure n = 1 yangmills theory or the n = 1 sqcd at the origin of the
space of vacua (with all scalar vevs vanishing): there the argument of [2] is valid and the use of the
nsvz beta function is justied.

actually, the argument can be reversed and used in a stronger manner. in a generic point of
the space of vacua of n = 1 sqcd, or of a pure n = 2 supersymmetric yangmills theory (a

4

n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with a matter chiral multiplet in the adjoint representation),
for example, cp invariance is spontaneously broken [13], and there is a nontrivial  dependence. by
holomorphic dependence of  on  = 
g2 this implies that the beta function gets necessarily
instanton corrections. a nave application of the nsvz formula to the n = 2 pure yangmills
theory, which would simply yield the purely one-loop perturbative beta function (g)= g3/42,
is thus incorrect.2

2 + 4i

it might be thought that in the n = 2 gauge theories where the exact lowenergy eective
4.
action is known [14, 15], the exact (nonperturbative) beta function can be computed. for such an
attempts see [4]. for concreteness we restrict our discussion below to the simplest such case: the
pure n = 2 su (2) yangmills theory.

due to the holomorphic nature of wilsonian eective action the rg equation can be cast into

the form

(27)

the coupling constant and the  parameter will evolve in the infrared up to the scale ir which can
be identied with the mass of the lightest charged particle. the diculty in nding the beta function
in these theories lies in the fact that in general the relation between ir and the gauge invariant
vev u = ht r2i is not simple. (for particular cases see below.) for this reason the knowledge of

ef f (u) =

dad
da

,

(28)

from the exact seiberg-witten solution as a function of the vacuum parameter u, is not sucient to
deduce the correct  function.

by integrating eq. (25) one gets:

z  d

( )  log  = c ;

(29)

where c is a -independent integration constant. the lower limit of the integration is left unspecied:
to change it is equivalent to a shift of c by a constant. we set now  = m (m is the uv cuto) and

2note that the original derivation of the nsvz beta function based on the calculation of certain oneinstanton
amplitude, applied in a simpleminded way to this theory, would yield the one-loop beta function. but this argument
also fails since in the presence of the adjoint scalar vev, the standard instanton selection rules do not apply.

use the known asymptotic behaviour of  and ( ). since the theory at large u is weakly coupled
at all scales, one can use the known behaviour of ef f for such cases [17],

ef f

(30)

where  (real) is dened such that the massless monopole occurs at u = 2, to nd the behavior
of  (m ) as a function of m . in fact, by identifying ir = m = 2|a|, one gets

(32)

this shows how the dynamical mass scale  and the bare  (= limm (m ) ) enter together as
two integration constants of the rg equation.

in the strong coupling region, i.e. near  = 0 (which is explored by theories near u = 2) the

infrared scale is given by ir = 2|ad| (the monopole mass). the divergent behavior of the second

term of the left hand side of eq. (29) must be cancelled by the rst term:

at large g.

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

the existence of the nontrivial space of vacua implies that, at any given scale, besides the usual

parameters g(), () one has the scale dependent vev,

as another parameter of the theory. the usual moduli parameter u is to be identied with its value
in the low energy limit. note that even though v() is complex, its phase is related by anomaly to

v() = htr2()i

(38)

6

() so that only three parameters are independent. at the uv cuto this relation is the standard
one:

v  eiv     + 2 ,

(39)

so that only the combination phys =   2 arg v has a physical meaning.

the scale dependence of v arises because in the instanton contributions to it the integrations
over the collective coordinates must be done so that only the distances between 1/m (m being the
uv cuto) and 1/ are involved. for instance, in the one instanton contribution the integration
over the instanton size must be limited to the region,

1
m

.

one is thus led to write one more rg equation besides eq. (25):



dv
d

= 2vg( ) .

(40)

(41)

when the moduli parameter u = htr2i is large as compared to 2, the theory is weakly coupled
at all scales, and 2|a| can be taken as the lower cuto . at large  (at   i) then

g( ) = 1  16 e2i + . . . ,

where r is another independent integration constant (the factor 8/2 has been inserted for con-

on the other hand, the second term of eq. (44) gives

 log

near u = 2, so that the linear dependence on u  2 cancels out, as it should.

one can also check the behavior near  = 0 = (1 + i)/2 of eq. (44), which corresponds to the
infrared behavior of the theory near u = 0. by a simple calculation using the results of ritz [4], one
nds that:

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

thus

( )
g( )

= ( )  2(  0) .

2z  d

( )

g( )  log(  0) ,

which is singular. but this singularity is expected because the second term of eq. (44) is also
logarithmically divergent, since:

u  i3

4( )|0  (  0) ,

8

(57)

as can be shown by using the relation between u and  :

u =

3
3

4( ) + 4
4( )  4

4( )
4( )

.

(58)

therefore, the logarithmic singularities cancel out.

these discussions simply check the derivation of (48), but also shows for instance that the zero
of ( ) = ( )/g( ) at 0 = (1 + i)/2 must be attributed to a pole in the renormalization factor
g( ), not to a zero of the beta function. for if the beta function had a zero at 0 = (1 + i)/2 the
rst term of the right hand side of eq.(29) would be singular there: such a singularity would have
to be cancelled by the second term, which is however regular there because the infrared cuto of
the theory with u = 0 is nite. this is another way of saying that the point u = 0 is not a special
point in the space of vacua: no restoration of the su (2) gauge symmetry occurs. the fact that
u  htr 2i = 0 there, is due to the instantoninduced renormalization of the composite operator
tr 2.

in conclusion, the problem of nding the correct nonperturbative beta function in supersymmetric
gauge theories remains open. let us also note that the related issue of the direct check of the seiberg
witten formulas in various n = 2 gauge theories by direct instanton calculations, after the initial
impressive success, leaves still many questions unanswered [19].
