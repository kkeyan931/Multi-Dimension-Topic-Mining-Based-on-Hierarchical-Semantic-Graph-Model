abstract

we study the relation between the (generalized) conformal quantum mechanics of 0-
branes and the two-dimensional dilaton gravity. the two-dimensional actions obtained
from the supergravity eective actions for the (dilatonic) 0-branes through the com-
pactication on a sphere are related to known two-dimensional dilaton gravity models.
the sl(2, r) symmetry of the (generalized) conformal quantum mechanics is realized
within such two-dimensional models. the two-dimensional dilatonic gravity model
derived from the non-dilatonic 0-brane action is related to the liouville theory and
therefore is conformal, whereas the two-dimensional model derived from the dilatonic
0-brane action does not have the conformal symmetry.

1 introduction

according to the ads/cft duality conjecture [1] and its generalization [2], the bulk
(gravity) theory on the near-horizon manifold of the supergravity brane solution is
equivalent to the boundary (eld) theory, which is the worldvolume theory of the
brane in the decoupling limit. this conjecture relates closed string theory and the
open string theory in the appropriate limit. namely, in taking the decoupling limit of
the brane worldvolume theory, which is the open string theory on the brane, to obtain
the gauge eld theory (an extensive review on the gauge eld theory as the decoupling
limit of the brane worldvolume theory can be found in ref. [3]), one ends up with the
near horizon region [4, 5] of the brane supergravity solution, which is the low energy
limit of the closed string theory. this ads/cft duality conjecture can be regarded
as a concrete string theory realization of the holographic principle [6, 7, 8] and the
previously conjectured equivalence [9, 4] between the bulk theory on the ads space
and the supersingleton eld theory, which is the eective worldvolume theory of the
brane solutions, on the boundary of the ads space (for a review on this subject, see
ref. [10]).

the isometry symmetry of the near-horizon manifold manifests as a symmetry of
the boundary eld theory and the boundary eld theory is conformal when the near-
horizon geometry of the supergravity brane solution (in the string-frame) contains the
ads space [4, 5]. on the other hand, according to refs.
[11, 4, 5, 12], any p-brane
supergravity solutions in the near-horizon limit take the adssn form in the so-called
dual-frame. so, the isometry symmetry of the ads space in the near-horizon region
of the dilatonic brane solutions in the dual-frame is also expected to be present in
the corresponding boundary eld theories but the boundary theories are not genuinely
conformal due to non-trivial dilaton eld. nevertheless, one can still dene generalized
conformal eld theory [13, 14], where string coupling is now regarded as a part of
background elds that transform under the symmetry.

in the 0-brane case, the corresponding boundary theory can be thought of as the
(generalized) conformal quantum mechanics [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] of the probe
0-brane in the near-horizon background of the source 0-brane supergravity solution.
the (generalized) conformal quantum mechanics of the 0-brane is shown [18, 20, 21] to
have the sl(2, r) symmetry, as expected from the fact that the near-horizon limit of
the 0-brane solution (in the dual-frame) is of the form ads2  sn, where the isometry
of the ads2 part is so(1, 2) = sl(2, r). the sl(2, r) symmetry of the probe 0-brane
is conformal for the non-dilatonic 0-branes [18], and is not genuinely conformal but can
be extended to the generalized conformal symmetry for the dilatonic 0-branes [20, 21].
since the supergravity 0-brane solution (in the dual-frame) in the near-horizon region
takes ads2  sn form, one can perform the freund-rubin compactication [22] of the

1

0-brane supergravity action on sn. the resulting theory is the two-dimensional dilaton
gravity with the (dilaton dependent) cosmological constant term. therefore, one would
expect the relevance of the (generalized) conformal quantum mechanics of 0-branes
to the two-dimensional dilaton gravity.
it is the purpose of this paper to elaborate
on such relation. we observe that the two-dimensional dilaton gravity compactied
from the 0-brane eective action has the sl(2, r) ane symmetry, in accordance
with the fact that the (generalized) conformal quantum mechanics of 0-brane has the
sl(2, r) symmetry. also, consistently with the case of the (generalized) conformal
quantum mechanics of 0-branes, the two-dimensional gravity model obtained from the
non-dilatonic 0-brane action is conformal, whereas the one obtained from the dilatonic
0-brane action is not conformal.

alized) conformal quantum mechanics of 0-branes.
in section 4, we compactify the
supergravity actions for the 0-branes on sd2 and relate the resulting two-dimensional
actions to various two-dimensional dilaton gravity models for the purpose of studying
the relevance of the (generalized) conformal quantum mechanics of 0-branes to the
two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories.

2 supergravity 0-brane solutions

in this section, we summarize the general supergravity 0-brane solution with an arbi-
trary dilaton coupling parameter a in arbitrary spacetime dimensions d. the super-
gravity action in the einstein-frame for such dilatonic 0-brane is given by

in the special cases pointed out in the previous paragraph, i.e.
the cases with the

3 (generalized) conformal quantum mechanics of

0-branes

the boundary theory counterpart to the bulk gravity theory in the near-horizon back-
ground of (dilatonic) 0-branes can be thought of as the (generalized) conformal quan-
tum mechanics. the (generalized) conformal mechanics is described by the dynamics
of the probe (dilatonic) 0-brane moving in the near-horizon eld background (12) or
(14) of the stack of the large number of source (dilatonic) 0-branes. the action for the
probe (dilatonic) 0-brane with the mass m and the charge q is

sprobe = z dl = z d (cid:18)me d4

d3 qgd

m n xm xn  q xm am(cid:19) ,

(16)

where gd
eld produced by the source (dilatonic) 0-brane.

m n , am and  are the dual-frame metric, the u(1) gauge eld and the dilaton

from the following mass-shell constraint for the probe (dilatonic) 0-brane:

gd m n (pm  qam )(pn  qan ) + m2e2 d4

d3  = 0,

(17)

where pm = l/ xm is the canonical momentum, one obtains the expression for
the hamiltonian h = pt describing the mechanics of the probe 0-brane. with the
following general spherically symmetric ansatz for the spacetime metric (in the dual-
frame):

d2,
one obtains the following expression for the hamiltonian [18, 20, 21]:

where ~l2 is the angular momentum operator of the probe 0-brane, and the expressions
for a, b, c,  and at that should enter in these expressions for f and g can be
read o from the near horizon 0-brane solution (12) with (13) or (14) with (15). for
particular values of the dilaton coupling parameter given by a = (d  4)/(d  2) 2,

2for this particular value of the dilatonic coupling parameter a, the kinetic term for the u (1) gauge
eld a1 in the string-frame (cf. see the corresponding action (3) in the string-frame) does not
have the dilaton  dependence, which is also the characteristic of the kinetic terms for the rr form
elds of string theories.

which include the cases of d0-brane, d0-brane and d = 4 reissner-nordstrom black
hole, the expressions for f and g get simplied signicantly [20, 21] as follows:

r + bc1~l2)/b + q(cid:21) ,

(21)

in this case, in the extreme limit (m = q) of the probe 0-brane the rst term in g drops
out and when the (extreme) probes motion is restricted along the radial direction (i.e.
~l2 = 0), g = 0.

the mechanics of the probe 0-brane has the sl(2, r) symmetry with the following

generators:

p 2
r
2f

+

g
2f 2 , k = 

1
2

h =

f r2, d =

2

rp r,

(22)

where the hamiltonian h generates the time translation, k generates the special confor-
mal transformation and d generates the scale transformation or the dilatation. these
generators satisfy the following sl(2, r) algebra [18, 20, 21]:

[d,h] = h,

[d,k] = k,

[h,k] = 2d.

(23)

in the non-dilatonic case (a = 0), i.e. the case of the reissner-nordstrom solution,
this sl(2, r) symmetry is the genuine conformal symmetry [18]. but when the dila-
ton eld is non-trivial (a 6= 0), the above sl(2, r) symmetry is no longer conformal,
because the string coupling gs = e changes under the dilatation and the special
conformal transformation. but one can still think of the generalized sl(2, r) con-
formal symmetry of the quantum mechanics of the dilatonic 0-brane [20, 21], in which
the string coupling is now regarded as a part of background elds that transform under
this symmetry [13, 14].

4 relations to two-dimensional dilaton gravity

in this section, we elaborate on the relation of the (generalized) conformal quantum
mechanics of the (probe) 0-branes to the two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. we
begin by discussing the symmetries of the general class of two-dimensional dilaton
gravity theories, to which we shall relate the sd2-compactied eective supergravity
action for the (source) 0-branes.

the most general coordinate invariant action functional of the metric g and the
dilaton , which depends at most on two derivatives of the elds, in two spacetime
dimensions has the following form [23]:

s[g, ] =

1
22

2 z d2xg(cid:20)1

2

 + v () + d()r(cid:21) ,

(24)

6

where v () is an arbitrary function of , d() is a dierentiable function of  such that
d() 6= 0 and dd()/d 6= 0, and r is the ricci scalar of the metric g. as pointed
out in ref. [23], although the action (24) is expressed in terms of two functions v ()
and d() of , the physics of this model does not depend on two arbitrary functions
of . in fact, it is later explicitly shown (following a comment in ref. [23]) in ref. [24]
that a -dependent weyl rescaling transformation g = 2()g, where () is the
solution to the following dierential equation:

1
2  2

dd
d

d ln 

d

= 0,

(25)

followed by redenition of the dilaton eld   d() leads to the following action
expressed in terms of only one function of the dilaton:

s =

1
22

2 z d2xgh rg + v ( )i ,

where the potential v is given by

v ( ) =

v (( ))
2(( ))

.

(26)

(27)

from now on, we suppress the bars in the elds.

in the conformal coordinates, in which the metric takes the form g = e2, the
general action (26) can be put into the following form of the non-linear sigma model:

s =

1
22

2 z d2xhgij(x)x ix i + ew (x)i ,

where for the case of the two-dimensional model with the action (26)

(x 1, x 2) = (, ), w (x) = 2 + ln v (),  = 1, gij = (cid:18) 0 1
0 (cid:19) .

1

(28)

(29)

the conditions for the non-linear sigma model action (28) (with arbitrary gij and w ,
not necessarily of the forms in eq. (29)) to be invariant under a general variation x i
of the target space coordinates x i(x) are [25]

x i =

w,j,

ijw = 0,

(30)

where |g| is the determinant of gij, w,i = iw and i is the covariant derivative
with respect to the target space metric gij(x). from the second condition in eq. (30),
one can see that the two-dimensional target space (with the metric gij) of the general
non-linear sigma model of the form (28) has to be at: 0 = [i,j]w,k = rkijw ,.

ij

q|g|

7

substituting the expression for w (x) in eq. (29) into the second condition in eq.
(30), one obtains the following condition [26] for the classical conformal invariance of
the general two-dimensional dilaton gravity model (26):

d2 ln v ()

d2

= 0,

(31)

from which one obtains the following general expression for the potential v () for the
conformally invariant two-dimensional dilaton gravity models:

v () = 42e,

(32)

where  and  are arbitrary constants.

furthermore, the invariance condition (30) implies the existence of a free eld f (x)

dened by f,k = q|g|kw , [25]. this free eld f is directly related to the noether

current j associated with the symmetry under the general variation x i as follows:

j = x igijx j = x iq|g|ijw ,j = f.

(33)

making use of the symmetry invariance, one can put the general non-linear sigma model
action (28) (with arbitrary gij and w ) into the following form:

s =

1
22

2 z d2x

1

 hf f + w w + ewi ,

(34)

where   w ,iw,i is a constant. so, when it is invariant under the symmetry, the
non-linear sigma model (28) is described [25] by a free eld f (x) and a eld w (x)
that satises the liouville eld equation in the at spacetime:

w =

1
2

ew .

(35)

we shall come back to this point later in this section.

in general, with an arbitrary potential v () the two-dimensional dilaton gravity
model with the action (26) has the symmetry under the following transformations [26]:

e = 0,

1 = 0,

2 = 2,

3 = 0,

where a is an arbitrary constant vector and j() = v (). the transformations 1, 2
and 3 close down to a non-abelian lie algebra, in which 2 is a central generator and
1 and 3 generate the ane subalgebra [1, 3] = 1

where e  1
2 [()2  j()] is interpreted as the local energy of the conguration and
j

r
of the spacetime coordinates), i.e. e = 0. when elds are on-shell, the symmetry 2
is identied as a dieomorphism with the vector eld f  = /()2. in particular,
due to the conservation e = 0 of the local energy e, the general action (26) is
invariant under the following transformation [27]:

closes under the algebra [f , g] = 1
2f ggf and in particular f s with f (e) = 1, e, e2
close an sl(2, r) algebra. when the potential v () takes the form (32), the two-
dimensional model (26) is invariant under the conformal transformation, which is the
linear combination  = 2 + 23 of the symmetry transformations in eq. (36) [26]:

f = f (e)j

g = g,

where keep in mind that the bars are suppressed in the above and we have let  :=
2 = 3.

4.1 dilatonic 0-brane case

from the near horizon metric (12) or (14) for the dual-frame dilatonic 0-brane solution,
one can see that there is the freund-rubin compactication [22] on sd2 of the action
(9) down to the following two-dimensional eective gauged supergravity action [21]:

s =

to bring the action (40) to the standard form (24), one redenes the dilaton as

action (40) takes the following standard form:

(42)

to remove the kinetic term for  to bring the action (42) to the form (26), one applies
one more weyl rescaling transformation g = e 
2 g. the resulting action has the
following form:

(43)

s =

1
22

2 z d2xghrg + 1 

2 i .

this resulting two-dimensional dilaton gravity model has the sl(2, r) ane sym-
metry, as will be discussed in the next subsection. this sl(2, r) symmetry is expected
from the fact that the generalized conformal mechanics of the probe dilatonic 0-brane
also has the sl(2, r) symmetry. since the potential term in the action (43) is not
of the form (32), the two-dimensional gravity model (43), derived from the dilatonic
0-brane supergravity action in d dimensions, is not conformal in general. this is also
consistent with the fact that the boundary theory counterpart to the bulk near-horizon
dilatonic 0-brane theory, namely the generalized conformal quantum mechanics of the
probe dilatonic 0-brane, is not genuinely conformal. from these facts, we are lead to
the speculation that the generalized conformal quantum mechanics of the probe dila-
tonic 0-brane is dual to the two-dimensional dilaton gravity model with the classical
action given by eq. (42) or eq. (43). in particular for the d0-brane case, which is
relevant to the m-theory in the light-cone frame [28], the exponent in the potential is
given by 1  /2 = 5/9.

the model with the action (43) is conformal when  = 2. from the expressions for
 and  in eq. (41), one can see that this happens when the dilaton coupling parameter
a takes the following special value:

a = 2

d  3
d  2

.

(44)

a special case of interest is the d = 4 case. in this case, the dilaton coupling parameter
becomes a = 1, which corresponds to the string theory inspired model of the d = 4
einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory. generally, for any values of d with a taking the
values specied by eq. (44), one can bring the action (43) to the form of the action of
the callan, giddings, harvey and strominger (cghs) model [29]. this can be done by

10

rst redening the dilaton eld as  = e2 and then by applying the weyl rescaling
transformation g = e2g. the resulting action has the following form:

s =

1
22

2 z d2xge2 [rg + 4g + ] .

(45)

indeed, the cghs model is known to be conformally invariant. namely, the cghs
model is invariant under the following transformation:

 = e2,

g = 2e2g.

(46)

this transformation, when expressed in terms of the elds of the action (43) with
 = 2, corresponds to the linear combination [26]  = 2  221 of the symmetry
transformations (36) of the generic action (26) with the potential given by eq. (32)
with  = 0:

 = ,

g = 0.

(47)

another interesting case is when  = 0, in which case the action (43) describes the

jackiw-teitelboim [30, 31] model with the following action:

s =

1
22

2 z d2xg [rg + ] .

(48)

this happens when the dilaton coupling a takes the following form:

(49)
an example is the case of d = 4 dilatonic 0-brane with the dilaton coupling a = 3.

a = 2

d  3
d  2

d  1.

4.2 non-dilatonic 0-brane case

the non-dilatonic case (i.e. a = 0 and  = 0) requires special treatment, because
the general two-dimensional action (40) (as well as the two-dimensional actions (42)
and (43) in standard forms) is not well-dened for this case, behaving singularly. for
example, the general formula for the cosmological constant  in eq. (41) becomes
zero when a = 0, although the compactied d = 2 solution in the near-horizon region
is the ads2 space, which requires non-zero cosmological constant term in the action.
so, in the following we rst derive the compactied two-dimensional action for the
non-dilatonic 0-brane case separately.

the eective action for the non-dilatonic 0-brane in d spacetime dimensions is

s =

1
22

d z ddxg(cid:20)rg 

1
2  2!

fm n f m n(cid:21) ,

(50)

11

where rg is the ricci scalar of the d-dimensional spacetime metric gm n (m, n =
0, 1, ..., d  1) and fm n is the eld strength of the u(1) gauge eld am . we take the
following ansatz for the d-dimensional spacetime metric:

gm n dxm dxn = g(x)dxdx + exp(cid:20)

4

d  2

(x)(cid:21) d2

d2,

(51)

where ,  = 0, 1. this general metric ansatz includes the metric for the 0-brane
solution as a special case. we assume that the u(1) gauge eld am is only electric,
i.e.
its only non-zero component is at. then, by solving the maxwells equation
m f m n = 0 with the above metric ansatz (51), one obtains the following expression
for the electric eld e = ftr:
(52)
where q is a constant related to the electric charge and g  det(g). then, the d-
dimensional action (50), upon dimensional reduction on sd2, becomes of the following
form:

ftr = qe2g,

where  is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric g. the solution to
these eld equations, through the relations (51) and (52) between the 2-dimensional
elds and the d-dimensional elds, reproduces non-dilatonic 0-brane solution in d
dimensions.

note, in this paper we are particularly interested in the two-dimensional theory
associated with the near-horizon approximation of the 0-brane solutions. the solution
for the non-dilatonic 0-brane in d dimensions is

ds2 = h2dt2 + h

2

d3 (dr2 + r2d2

d2),

at = h1,

(55)

12

following form:

where h = 1 + (cid:16) 
ds2 =   r

r(cid:17)d3
!2(d3)

. in the near-horizon region (r  ), the solution takes the

r(cid:19)2
dt2 +(cid:18)

dr2 + 2d2

d2,

at =   r

!d3

.

(56)

as expected, the spacetime in the near-horizon region is ads2  sd2. so, the two-
dimensional scalar eld (x) (or (x)) dened in eq. (51) becomes constant in the
near-horizon region of the 0-brane solution. the eld equations (54) therefore reduce
to the following:

rg   = 0,

(57)

 (cid:17)2
where  = 2(cid:16) d3
. this constant  is exactly the curvature rg of the (t, r) part
(cid:17)2(d3)
gdxdx = (cid:16) r
dr2 of the metric gm n in eq. (56). note, the
curvature rg of this ads2 metric has the positive sign due to the choice of the signature
(+) for the metric.

r(cid:17)2
dt2 + (cid:16) 

we realize that the eld equation (57) describes the liouville theory (for a review
on the liouville theory, see ref.
[32]). this can be seen by going to the coordinate
system where the spacetime becomes conformally at, which is always possible for the
two-dimensional spacetime. for the two-dimensional subset of the spacetime described
by the metric in eq. (56), this is achieved by dening new radial coordinate as  
d3 (cid:16) 

. in this new coordinates, the solution (56) takes the following form:

r(cid:17)d3



ds2 = (cid:18) 

d  3(cid:19)2 1

2 hdt2 + d2i + 2d2

d2,



d  3

1


at = 

,

(58)

where the (t, ) part of the metric is conformally at. if we denote the two-dimensional
(subspace) metric g in the conformally at coordinate system as g = e, then
eq. (57) reduces to the following:

  e = 0,
which is the liouville eld equation in at spacetime.

(59)

in general, the liouville theory in a curved spacetime with the metric g is dened

by the following action [33]:

s =

1

8 z d2xqg"g + qrg +

2

2 e# .

(60)

the requirement of conformal invariance of the classical liouville action determines the
classical background charge coecient q to be q = 2/. with this choice of q, the
liouville action (60) is invariant under the following weyl rescaling transformations:

g  e2 g,

    2,

(61)

13

which is equivalent to demanding the metric g = eg to be invariant.

the liouville theory is known to have the hidden sl(2, r) symmetry [34, 35]. this
hidden sl(2, r) symmetry can be seen 3 easily in the light-cone (polyakov) gauge, in
which the metric takes the following form:

ds2 = dx+dx + h++(x+, x)(dx+)2.

(62)

the residual symmetry of this gauge choice contains the virasoro (conformal) symme-
try and the sl(2, r) current symmetry of the liouville theory. one can replace the
metric component h++ by a new eld f through the relation:

+f = h++f.

(63)

by using the equation of motion for , one can also express the liouville eld  in terms
of f . the resulting liouville action, expressed totally in terms of f , is invariant under
the following variation of f , which corresponds to the reparametrization variation 4
h++ = + of the metric component h++:

f = f,

(64)

provided the innitesimal parameter (x) satises the condition 3

general innitesimal variation parameter  that satises this condition is

 = 0. the most

(x+, x) = w(x+) + xw0(x+) + (x)2w+(x+).

(65)

under this reparametrization variation with the innitesimal parameter given by (65),
the metric component h++ transforms as

h++ = hwj + w0j0 + w+j+i h++ + 2h+w + x+w0 + (x)2+w+i ,

(66)

where j  , j0  x  1 and j+  (x)2  2x. the generators j,0,+ of the
above transformation satisfy the following sl(2, r) algebra:

[j0, j] = j,

[j0, j+] = j+,

[j+, j] = 2j0.

(67)

another way of seeing the hidden sl(2, r) is by considering the metric component
constraint 3
h++ = 0 that follows from the equations of motion. the general form of

the metric component h++ that satises this constraint is

h++(x+, x) = j +(x+)  2j 0(x+)x + j(x+)(x)2.

(68)

3before one applies the analysis described in the following, one has to rst apply the weyl rescaling
transformation g  eg to remove the dependence on  of the potential term in the action (60).
4when applying the reparametrization variation, one has to make sure that the light-cone gauge
is maintained.

14

under the reparametrization variation h++ = + with the innitesimal parameter
 given by eq. (65), j a(x+) (a = , 0, +) transform as

j a = f abcwbgcdj d + 2gab+wb,

(69)

where f abc and gab are respectively the structure constants and the cartans metric of
the sl(2, r) algebra. this sl(2, r) ane kac-moody symmetry can also be seen by
considering the ward identity [34].

similarly, one can show that the generic two-dimensional dilaton gravity action
(42) obtained from the (source) dilatonic 0-brane action in d dimensions also has
the sl(2, r) current symmetry. so, the sl(2, r) symmetry of the (generalized) con-
formal quantum mechanics of the (probe) dilatonic and non-dilatonic 0-branes can be
realized within the two-dimensional dilaton gravity models obtained from the eective
actions for the (source) 0-branes through the sd2 compactication. before one ap-
plies the analysis similar to the one described in the previous paragraph, one has to
rst apply the weyl rescaling transformation of the metric to remove the dilaton de-
pendence of the potential term of the action (42) and then redene the dilaton to have
the standard dilaton kinetic term. however, unlike the case of the two-dimensional
dilaton gravity model associate with the (source) dilatonic 0-branes (discussed in the
previous subsection), the liouville theory, associated with the (source) non-dilatonic
0-branes, in addition has the conformal symmetry, which we discuss in the following.
the stress-energy tensor t = 2s/g of the classical liouville theory with the

action (60) has the following form:

tz z = 0,

tzz = 

1
2

()2 +

1
2

q2  t (z),

tz z = t (z),

(70)

where z = t + ix. since the trace of the stress-energy tensor t 
 = 4tz z is zero, the
classical liouville theory is conformally invariant, which is consistent with the fact
that the conformal quantum mechanics of non-dilatonic 0-branes also has conformal
symmetry. under the conformal transformation z  w(z), the liouville eld and the
stress-energy tensor transform as

   

1


ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where s[w; z]  w
is the schwartzian derivative. therefore, the coecients
(called virasoro operators) of the following laurent expansion of the stress-energy
tensor

w  3

t (z) = xnz

algebra with the central charge c = 12/2:

2i zn+1t (z) and ln = h dz

where ln = h dz

2i zn+1 t (z), satisfy the following virasoro

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +
[ ln, lm] = (n  m) ln+m +
[ln, lm] = 0.

1
2 (n3  n)n+m,0,
1
2 (n3  n)n+m,0,

(73)

note, the conformal algebra of the liouville theory already has the anomaly term
(proportional to the central charge) at the classical level. the quantum eect due to
the normal ordering of the virasoro generators gives rise to the additional contribution
to the central charge. this results in the renormalization of the parameter 1/2 in the
liouville action (60) [36].

in the at background (g = ), the liouville action (60) takes the following form,

after the eld redenition  = 1:

s =

1

42 z dx2(cid:20) 1

2

 + e(cid:21) .

(74)

the eld equation of this action yields the liouville eld equation (59) in at space-
time, which is also the eld equation of the non-dilatonic 0-brane in the near-horizon
region. this at spacetime liouville action is invariant under the following conformal
transformation:

x  f(x),

(x+, x)  (f +(x+), f(x)) + lnhf + (x+)f (x)i ,

(75)

where x = t  x and f  = df/dx. again, this is consistent with the fact that the
boundary theory of the bulk theory on the ads2 space, i.e. the quantum mechanics of
the (probe) non-dilatonic 0-brane, is also conformal.

the general solution to the liouville equation (59) in at spacetime is given by [37]

(x+, x) = ln

8a+(x+)a


|| [a+(x+)  a(x)]2 ,

(x)

(76)

where a(x) is an arbitrary function such that a
= da/dx > 0 and  is the sign

of , i.e.  = /||. this general solution is invariant under the following sl(2, r)
transformation of a:

a+(x+) 

aa+(x+) + b
ca+(x+) + d

,

a(x) 

aa(x) + b
ca(x) + d

,

(77)

where real numbers a, b, c, d satisfy ad  bc = 1.

16

the underlying sl(2, r) symmetry of the liouville theory in at spacetime be-
comes manifest in the hamiltonian expressed in terms of free elds and their conjugate
momenta. such free elds are obtained from a+(x+) through the inverse scattering
method followed by the bosonization. as a side comment, the elds 1/2 obtained
from a+(x+) through the inverse scattering method transform in the linear spin 1/2
representation under sl(2, r). the details on the hidden sl(2, r) symmetry of the
liouville theory in at spacetime can be found, for example, in ref. [32].

the general solution (76) can be obtained from the following simple solution:

(x+, x) = ln

8

||(x+  x)2 ,

(78)

which corresponds to the a = x case of (76), by applying the conformal transfor-
mation (75). the resulting (conformal transformed) general solution is given by eq.
(76) with a(x) = f(x). in fact, under the conformal transformation (75), the
functions a(x) in the general solution (76) transform as in eq. (77), namely

a+(f +(x+)) =

aa+(x+) + b
ca+(x+) + d

,

a(f(x)) =

aa(x) + b
ca(x) + d

.

(79)

therefore, all the solutions to the liouville equation (59) in the at spacetime is related
to the simple solution (78) through the conformal transformation (75) or the sl(2, r)
transformation (77).

 (cid:17)2
of the non-dilatonic 0-brane, the constant  = 2(cid:16) d3

for the case under consideration in this section, namely the near horizon spacetime
is always positive and therefore
in the above  = 1. we notice that the simplest solution (78) to the liouville equation
(59) corresponds to the two-dimensional subspace of the near-horizon solution (58) of
the non-dilatonic 0-brane in the conformal coordinates. therefore, all the solutions
of the liouville eld theory is locally related through the conformal transformation
(75) or the sl(2, r) transformation (77) to the near-horizon region solution of the
non-dilatonic 0-brane. this provides one of the evidences for the equivalence of the
conformal quantum mechanics of non-dilatonic 0-branes to the liouville eld theory.
we mentioned previously that the most general two-dimensional dilaton gravity

model with conformal invariance has the following action:

s =

1
22

2 z d2xgh rg + 42e i .

(80)

for the  6= 0 case, by redening a new dilaton eld as   2  and then by applying
the weyl rescaling transformation g = e/2g, one can transform the action (80)
to the following form:

s =

1

2 z d2xg(cid:20)rg +

42

1
2

g + 82e(cid:21) .

(81)

17

we recognize that this is the liouville action in curved spacetime. in the  = 0 case,
one can also bring the action (80) to the liouville-like form through the weyl rescaling
transformation g = e g. the resulting action has the following form:

s =

1
22

2 z d2xgh rg + g



 + 42e

i ,

(82)

with dierent numerical factor in front of the kinetic term of , and therefore has to
be identied with the liouville action (60) with non-critical value of q dierent from
q = 2/. anyhow, by going to the gauge and the coordinate frame in which the
spacetime is at, one can bring the actions (81) and (82) to the form of the action
(74) for the liouville theory in at spacetime. this can also be seen directly from the
following eld equations for the action (80) in the conformal coordinates (in which the
metric takes the form g = e2):

(2   ) = 0
(2 +  ) = 82e+ .

(83)

so, whereas 2    is a free eld, 2 +   satises the liouville eld equation in at
if one lets 2 =  , which is equivalent to applying the weyl rescaling
spacetime.
transformation g = e g and then going to the gauge where g = , one is
left only with a theory with the liouville eld  = 2 +   = 2  in at spacetime,
as pointed out in the above. also, as it is pointed out in the paragraph that follows
eq. (32), the general non-linear sigma model with the action (28) with the conformal
symmetry is described by a free scalar eld and the (at spacetime) liouville eld.
thus, one can see that all the conformally invariant two-dimensional dilaton gravity is
at least locally equivalent to the liouville theory in at spacetime and therefore to the
conformal quantum mechanics of the probe non-dilatonic 0-brane in the near-horizon
background of the source non-dilatonic 0-brane.
