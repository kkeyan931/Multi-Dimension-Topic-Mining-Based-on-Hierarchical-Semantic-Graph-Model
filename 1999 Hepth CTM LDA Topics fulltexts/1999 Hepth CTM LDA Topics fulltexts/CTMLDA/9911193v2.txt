abstract

we calculate the eect of noncommutative spacetime on the greybody factor

on the supergravity side. for this purpose we introduce a system of d3-

branes with a constant ns b-eld along their world volume directions (x2, x3).

in the b   limit, one has the d=7 black hole solution including the
noncommutative eect. considering the propagation of minimally coupled

scalar in this background, we derive an exact form of the greybody factor in

b eld. it turns out that, although the two expressions of b6=0

l

and b=0

l

are the same form, one nds b6=0

l

> b=0

l

. this means that the presence of

b-eld (the noncommutativity) suppresses the curvature eect surrounding

the black hole.

recently noncommutative geometry has attracted much interest in studying on string

and m-theory in the b-eld [17]. for simplicity, we consider supergravity solutions which

are related to d3 branes with ns b elds. according to the ads/cft correspondence [8],

the near horizon geometry of d=7 black hole solution can describe the large n limit of

noncommutative super yang-mills theory (ncsym). we take a decoupling limit to isolate

the near horizon geometry from the remaining one. it turns out that the noncommutativity

aects the ultra violet(uv) but not the infra red(ir) of the yang-mills dynamics. the

ncsym is thus not useful for studying the theory at short distances. it is well known that

an ncsym with the noncommutativity scale  on a torus of size  is equivalent to an

ordinary supersymmetric yang-mills theory (osym) with a magnetic ux if  = 2/2

is a rational number [9]. the equivalence between the ncsym and the osym can be

understood from the t-duality of the corresponding string theory. hence the osym with

b-eld is the proper description in the uv region, while the ncsym takes over in the

ir region. actually, the noncommutativity comes from the b   limit of the ordinary
theories [5,6,10].

on the other hand, it turns out that the total number of physical degrees of freedom for

the noncommutative case at any given scale coincides with the commutative case [5]. all

thermodynamic quantities of the ncsym including the entropy are the same as those of the

osym. however, in the next order correction of the -expansion, the entropy decreases in

the ncsym [11]. we remind the reader that aside the entropy, there exists an important

dynamical quantity the greybody factor(absorption cross section) for the quantum black

hole [1215]. hence it is very important to check whether there is or not a change in the

greybody factors between the commutative and the noncommutative cases. on the string

side, there was a calculation for the absorption of scalars into the noncommutative d3-branes

[16].

in this paper we wish to study the quantum aspects of d3-brane black hole in b-eld

background using a minimally coupled scalar. this may belong to the o-diagonal gravitons

polarized parallel to the brane (hab, a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3). we will derive an exact form of absorp-

2

tion cross section in b-eld on the supergravity side. however, it is not easy to obtain the

absorption cross section on the gauge theory side because the graviton can turn into pairs of

gauge bosons, scalars, or fermions in the world volume approach. in the absence of b-eld,

adding up these rates leads to the absorption cross section of hab on the superstring side

[12].

we start with the d=7 extremal black hole solution for d3-branes in a b23-eld on the

d=10 string frame [5]

b23 = tan f 1h, e2 = g2h,

f01r =

sin r(f 1), f0123r =

cos hr(f 1).

here the asymptotic value of b-eld is b

23 = tan  and the parameter r is dened by

cos r4 = 4gn2 with n(the number of d3-branes). and g = g is the string coupling

constant. it is obvious that for  = 0, one recovers the ordinary d3-brane black hole with the
standard ads5s5 in the near horizon. in this case the dilaton background() is constant.
but for  = /2 one nds the d3-brane black hole in the large b-eld. in latter case, one
nds a deviation from ads5s5 in the near horizon.

now let us introduce the perturbation analysis to derive the greybody factor. general

uctuations including the dilaton and the rr scalar will be given as the complicated systems

of dierential equations in the einstein frame [17]. a simple equation may be arised from

the o-diagonal graviton uctuation of h01 [8,12]. let us set all other uctuations to zero

and introduce a minimally coupled scalar  which may be g00h01. this scalar is a good test

eld in the einstein frame because it is minimally coupled to the background spacetime.

then this in the einstein frame satises

this leads to

where gm n is the string frame metric in (1).

now let us consider

(t, x1, x2, x3, r, i) = eitei(k1x1+k2x2+k3x3)yl(1, 2,    , 5)l(r)

with 2
iyl(i) = l(l + 4)yl(i). here l(r) is the radial part of the l-partial wave of energy
. we assume the coordinate dependence along the world volume directions. then eq. (3)

takes the form

take the same form up to the leading-correction, there exist

some dierences to point out. first, because of  < , one nds b=0

0 < b

0

. this implies

that in the presence of large b-eld(b  ), the height of potential is lower than the case of
b = 0. actually, we observe from eq.(5) that the height of the eective potential decreases

as  (that is, the strength of b-eld) increases. hence, in the low energy scattering, one

nds the larger absorption cross section b

0

than b=0

0

. the greybody factor of the black

hole arises as a consequence of scattering of minimally coupled scalar o the gravitational

potential barrier surrounding the horizon; that is, this is an eect of spacetime curvature

[15]. furthermore, we wish to point out that there also exists the dierence for r in the

logarithmic terms.

5

we have seen the eect of strong b-eld on the absorption probability for d3-branes

above. now we may ask how the greybody factor changes in the presence of arbitrary

b-eld. for an arbitrary b, we can rewrite the eq.(5) in the following form:

( 2
r2 +

5
r

l(l + 4)

r2 + 2 1 +


r 
(cid:27) r4. suprisingly, we nd that the above equation has exactly

r4
r4 !) l

b = 0,

(15)

where r4 = (cid:26)1 + (k2

3) sin2 
2+k2
2

the same form as eq.(6) with dierent r. then the absorption cross section can be read

o from (8) by substituting r with r as follows

b
l = b=0

l

(r  r).

(16)

this is our main result. from (16) one can recover b=0

0

in (10) for  = 0 as well as b

0

one nds b6=0

in (14) for  = /2. here we point out several main features. firstly, for arbitrary b-eld,
since r > r and  r < 1. secondly, since r incerases as   0,
the wave packet having lower energy is absorbed more easily. thirdly, since the absorption

> b=0

l

cross section in the presence of b-eld is exactly same as that in the absence of b-eld with

r = (cid:26)1 + (k2

2+k2
3) sin2 
2

(cid:27)1/4

r, it may imply that the scattering wave regards the geometry

as being the same with an increased ads5 radius as long as the absorption cross section

is concerned. furthermore, a recent paper [17] pointed out that the einstein metric of a

d3-brane is not changed by the presence of a b-eld. this implies that for a minimally

coupled scalar, the solution with the b-eld can be obtained from the solution without the

b-eld by replacing r by r.

we conclude that the presence of b-eld (the noncommutativity) suppresses the eect

of curvature surrounding the black hole.

note added

after our work has been done, we nd a related paper [18]. this paper takes over the same

subject with the rr scalar (c), which is non-minimally coupled to the background. kaya

6

claims that the greybody factor does not change even if the b-eld is turned on. however,

we point out that such result in ref. [18] comes from the assumption that the scalar eld

c does not depend on the world volume coordinates (x2, x3) of d3-branes. in our case, if

 does not depend on (x2, x3), equivalently, k2 = k3 = 0, we also recover the usual result

for d3-branes without b-eld [5,17]. it indicates that, in order to extract the b-eld eect,

the world volume dependence of the scalar eld is a key ingredient. presummably, it follows

because the propagation of elds does not feel the presence of b-eld if the wave does not

move on the x2-x3 plane [12]. although we have not carried out the calculation for the rr

scalar c, we expect that the main result of b6=0

l

> b=0

l

is still valid for the case of rr

scalar.
