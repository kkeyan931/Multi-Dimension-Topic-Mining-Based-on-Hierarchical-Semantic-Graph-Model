abstract. marginally bound systems of two types of branes are considered, such as
the prototypical case of dp + 4 branes and dp branes. as the transverse separation
between the two types of branes goes to zero, dierent behaviour occurs in the
supergravity solutions depending on p; no-hair theorems result for p 1 only. within
the framework of the ads/cft correspondence, these supergravity no-hair results
are understood as dual manifestations of the coleman-mermin-wagner theorem.
furthermore, the rates of delocalization for p 1 are matched in a scaling analysis.
contribution to the proceedings of strings 99; based on [1] written with d. marolf.

1. introduction

no-hair theorems appear prominently in the study of black holes. they are, however,
not general; assumptions about the eld content of the action are required.

in the supergravity approximation to string theory, there are black p-brane solutions
available as well as black holes. certain systems involving two types of bps branes are
marginally bound, stable at any transverse separation. supergravity solutions which are
fully localized are known for some of these systems, albeit rarely in terms of elementary
functions. in this article we will use the method of surya and marolf [2] to exhibit the
behaviour of the solutions as the separation goes to zero, and to derive no-hair theorems.
the ads/cft correspondence [3, 24] is a duality between gauge theories on p-
branes and the near-horizon limit of the corresponding supergravity solutions. we
discuss this limit of the supergravity solutions for the intersecting brane systems of
interest, and we nd the dual phenomenon to the no-hair theorems to be the coleman-
mermin-wagner theorem [4, 5], viz. the lack of superselection sectors in low-dimensional
quantum eld theories. we also show that the delocalization rates obtained from a
scaling analysis in the eld theory are captured by the supergravity; in particular, the
strong sensitivity to the dimension p. we end with remarks about future directions.

2. baldness, a.k.a. supergravity no-hair theorems

one context in which a black hole no-hair theorem in general relativity may be seen is
a process in which a small extremal black hole of charge q is brought up to the horizon
of a large extremal black hole of charge q  q. since the geometry for the two extremal
black holes is static for any nite separation , this system can be easily studied at any
. as the separation   0, the conguration becomes spherically symmetric. the
theory does not allow the small charge to end up localized on the horizon of the large
black hole.

more generally, nding localized solutions in supergravity is dicult. as a very
simple example, consider taking the dp-brane supergravity solution and performing
t-duality along a worldvolume direction, say xp. use of the buscher rules results in a
solution that looks like a dp1-brane, except that it possesses only a transverse so(8p)
symmetry instead of so(9p). in other words, the harmonic function falls o like rp7
instead of rp8. this solution corresponds to the smeared dp1-brane. of course, we
know what the unsmeared dp1-brane solution looks like in this case, but more generally
the unsmeared version of a smeared solution cannot be successfully guessed. the point
of view which we advocate in this article is that sometimes unsmeared supergravity
solutions do not in fact exist, for reasons that become clear in the context of the
generalized ads/cft correspondence.

in the following analysis we are interested in bps systems comprising two clumps
of branes which are marginally bound to each other. the prototype of this system is the
d0k d4(0), and under dualities this is connected to dp k dp+4, dm  dn(p), m+n = p+4
e.g. d2 d2(0), f1 dp(0), dp  ns5(p1), and so on.

supergravity solutions for such systems have been studied by many groups; a partial
list is [6]-[17],[18], see [1] for other references. for purposes of orientation we briey
review the features relevant for our discussion here. maintaining some generality for the
moment, we let there be two types of branes, da and db, with common directions t, zi,
relatively transverse worldvolume directions za, zb respectively, and overall transverse
coordinates x. we use the harmonic function rule [10] ansatz; suppressing the r-r
gauge potentials this is

allowing the branes to have harmonic functions that depend on all coordinates
transverse to them, i.e. ha = ha(x, zb), hb = hb(x, za), the equations of motion
become (see, for example, [11])

[2
[2

a] hb(x, za) = qb (b) ;

(bha)(ahb) = 0 .

(2.2)

baldness/delocalization in intersecting brane systems

it is clear that one clump of branes, say the a-branes,

from the last equation,
is
necessarily delocalized along the worldvolume of the other clump. for the prototype
d0kd4 this is no restriction because there are no zb. however, for an orthogonal
intersection such as d2d2(0) this is a restriction on the generality of the ansatz;
we will remark on the case of orthogonal intersections in the last section. relabeling
the dp + 4 brane the big brane and the dp the wee one, and za  z, our basic
supergravity equations become

[2
[2

] hbig(x) = qbig (big) ;
 + hbig(x)2

z ] hwee(x, z) = qwee (wee) .

(2.3)

the rst equation is the usual one for the big branes. the second equation is more
dicult to solve; here we will use the method of surya and marolf [2].

we can now pose the problem in which we are interested. consider the setup of
nbig big branes with nwee wee branes separated from them in the transverse direction
by .

the dp+4-branes are displaced from the dp-branes by .

what we wish to know is whether the wee brane can be localized in the worldvolume of
the big brane as the separation is taken to zero, in the supergravity regime.

to motivate this, consider the simple and familiar example of the d-instanton in
the background of the d3-brane. the supergravity solution is known explicitly only in
the near-horizon region of the d3-brane, which is ads5s5, [21] (see also [19, 20])

here, the d-instanton position in euclidean 10-space is (x, ), and the ir/uv relation
relates  to the usual radial coordinate u = r/2

the quantity 0 is identied [21] as the scale size of the instanton in the gauge theory.
normally, the ir/uv relation is interpreted as saying that the instanton scale size 0
goes to zero as the d-instanton goes to the boundary. in the context of our problem of
interest, however, we are interested in the other end of things: as   0 , 0  . an
alternative way to see that the d-instanton delocalizes without the ads/cft baggage

ds2 = h1 (ads5  s5) ;
h1 = 1 +

is simply to stare at the supergravity harmonic function for the d-instanton: as the
separation   1/0  0, h1 loses all information about the relatively transverse
coordinates x

h1   0

1 .

(2.6)

this is a no-hair theorem as, if this x information had not been erased, we could have
used the above process to build black d3-branes with d-instanton hair in the form of
an arbitrary distribution of d-instanton charge.

note that in our analysis our solutions will always be taken to be such that they can
be matched onto the full asymptotically at solutions. this means that in any p-brane
ads/cft correspondence we are doing gauge theory on rp. as mentioned in [1], this
condition rules out some known near-horizon supergravity solutions [22]; it would be
interesting to learn what interpretation these solutions may have in another context.
at this point we also mention that there are some other known solutions which are
not of the type we want. some are partially localized, but typically these are buscher
t-dual to larger-brane solutions. in addition, from the second equation of motion in
(2.3) it is possible to see that we can trade some transverse localization for worldvolume
localization. since this does not maintain the integrity of the dimension of bigger brane
in the solution, we will not consider these either.

let us recap the solution for the harmonic function of the big (dp + 4) branes. we

have

hbig = qbig (x)  hbig = 1 +

where cp = (2)(5p)/2 [(7  p)/2]. for the wee branes,

(2.8)

 + hbig(x)2

zi hwee(x, z) = qwee (x  ) (z) .

surya and marolfs method [2] for solving this equation of motion involves doing a
fourier transform in the four relatively transverse z coordinates, and it allows transverse
separation . the fourier transform converts the z derivative into a wavevector, and
the equation can then be solved fourier mode by fourier mode. it can also be shown
that in order to track the behaviour of each fourier mode at small separation , keeping
the spherically symmetric modes suces. then the equation reduces to a second order
ode in the radial variable r = |x|; this can be solved explicitly and matched across the
-function. the resulting fourier series/transform can be shown to converge absolutely,
except of course at the location of the -function. for details, the reader is referred to
the original paper [1].

the results obtained by this method give distinctly dierent behaviour depending

on p [1]:

1  p  1 : baldness ;

p = 2 :

hair .

(2.9)

(recall that we are not going higher than p = 2 because we take the big-brane, which
has dimension p + 4, to be asymptotically at.) for a previous idea on expectations
based on the dimensionality p see [23].

baldness/delocalization in intersecting brane systems

5

from the supergravity perspective these hair/baldness results come about because
of the dierent character of the dierential equations with 1/r versus stronger potentials
1/rn>1. note also that the result for p = 2 meshes nicely with the existence of an explicit
analytic solution found in [18], viz. d2-branes inside d6-branes, in the near-horizon limit
of the d6-brane.

we can actually do better than deriving no-hair theorems for the low-dimensional
cases; we can also work out the rates of delocalization of the wee-branes as they
approach the big-branes. these may be computed by sitting out at a xed transverse
distance from the big-brane, which we choose to be the characteristic supergravity radius
rp+4 = s(gsnbig)1/(3p), and watching the behaviour of the dierent fourier modes of
the elds of the wee-brane in the   0 limit. the delocalization can thereby be
characterized by a distance scale z. from the supergravity equations we thusly nd
the scaling [1]

p = 1 :

p = 0 :

p = 1 :

the result for the d-instanton agrees with the ir/uv relation, which is a consistency
check. the other relations look suspiciously like low-dimensional quantum eld theory
relations, and we will conrm this later in a precise fashion. we will also see why the
no-hair theorems depend so strongly on the dimension p.

3. the ads/cft correspondence and the cmw theorem

we would now like to dene an ads/cft correspondence for this system of two types
of branes by analogy with [3, 24]; see also [25]. of course, the gauge couplings on the big
and wee branes are built out of the same string theory parameters, g2 (p)
ym = (2)p2gsp3
.
the decoupling limit `a la maldacena can be cast in dimensionless statements as follows:
(es)  0, e  u = r/2
s . now, since the dimensionless gauge coupling is
formed by factoring in p3 powers of the typical gauge theory energy e [24],

s  /2

s

g2
e = (2)p2gs(es)p3 ,

(3.1)

the physics in the low-energy or decoupling limit will depend on which dimensionless
coupling we keep xed. since we wish to keep the physics of the big-brane in the game,
we keep the big-brane coupling xed and so the wee-brane coupling will go to innity
in this limit, at xed energy e. simply put, the big-brane physics is irrelevant in the
infrared. thus, the eld theory that we will be interested in is p+1 dimensional.

we also need to pin down the other parameters. since we want to be in the
supergravity regime, we will keep nwee, nbig  1 but introduce no particular hierarchy

baldness/delocalization in intersecting brane systems

6

between them. we also choose to keep the relative four-volume v4 xed, i.e. we will
not scale it to zero as 4
s . we are most interested in the case where the big-brane is
non-compact, i.e. v4  . in the context of the ads5s5correspondence, this means
having only a nite number of d-instantons. however, in our supergravity analysis we
can also handle the case of nite-volume, which in the ads5s5case corresponds to a
nite density of d-instantons per unit d3-worldvolume; see [26] for an analysis of this
system.

3.1. the supergravity side

taking the decoupling limit of our supergravity solution makes the big (p+4)-brane go
near-horizon; we lose the 1 in its harmonic function hbig,

(2)p+2

.

(3.2)

the more interesting issue is what happens to the wee-brane. our solution retains
dependence on the separation . for the cases which delocalize, we can analyze the
harmonic function for the wee-brane near the core of the big-brane. we nd by careful
attention to boundary conditions that we must not drop the 1 in the harmonic function
for the delocalizing wee-brane [1]. see also [27] for similar conclusions on this issue. this
phenomenon of not losing the 1 we saw very explicitly for the case of the d-instanton
in the near-horizon region of the d3-brane, again a consistency check. (for the p = 0
system, in a sense we are operating half-way between a probe calculation where h0 = 1
and a dlcq calculation where the 1 in the supergravity h0 is dropped at the outset.)
in addition, upon checking the dilaton and metric curvatures, we nd that the
delocalizing wee-brane has a minor eect [1]; it does not change the region where the
curvature becomes large, and the region where the dilaton becomes large occurs only
extremely close to the wee-branes - the presence of the big-brane transversely shrinks
the strong-dilaton region that occurs for nbig = 0 .

note also that for the case of nite v4 it turns out that, as   0, we recover the

smeared solution in which hwee  1/u 3p just like hbig.

3.2. the eld theory side

in the decoupling limit, the coupling between bulk and brane physics vanishes.
in
the p+1 dimensional eld theory, decoupling occurs between the higgs and coulomb
branches, even quantum mechanically [28]. for our situation where we are near-horizon
for the big-brane, we are in the higgs branch of the eld theory. the eld content may
be recalled by remembering that the dp branes can be thought of as instantons in the
dp + 4-brane; the p + 1 dimensional eld theory is the theory of the collective modes
of these instantons. as reviewed in [29] (see also [30],[31]), the fact that the wee-brane
gauge coupling goes to innity at xed energy in our scaling limit means that some elds,
which correspond to the pp strings which are transverse scalars, become auxiliary and

baldness/delocalization in intersecting brane systems

7

may be integrated out. the resulting theory is a nonlinear sigma-model. (see also [32]
for an analysis in a dierent regime, where dierent elds may be integrated out.)

the degrees of freedom of our higgs branch theory are the instanton scale size
and orientation, and center of mass position. in addition, the theory is very strongly
coupled because we are working in the supergravity regime. let us concentrate on the
instanton scale size mode, which take as a proxy for how delocalized the wee-brane is. in
low-dimensional quantum eld theories, the coleman-mermin-wagner theorem prevents
superselection sectors in the quantum regime. this theorem then tells us that we have
wild infrared uctuations leading to complete delocalization for p  1, i.e. baldness.
for p  2 superselection sectors are allowed quantum mechanically, so that we have
hair for p = 2. these results are in direct accord with the supergravity results, as we
promised earlier.

in fact, we can go further and use scaling arguments to compute in the low-
dimensional eld theories estimates for the delocalization rates. as the separation
  0, the ir uctuations will become stronger and stronger, and eventually give
complete delocalization. let us take the ir cuto to be

ir =


2
s

.

(3.3)

in a sense we are reconstructing a eld that was integrated out by putting back this ir
cuto; see also [29] for a more quantitative discussion on this point.

we now wish to calculate a rms value for the instanton scale size. we rst treat the
case of the d0-brane inside the d4-brane. for a single d0 instanton the moduli space
metric is at; we will assume that for large-n0 the free-eld approximation works as well,
possibly modulo 1/n corrections which we will not worry about. also we assume that
each instanton uctuates independently but has approximately the same size - this latter
assumption is motivated by the work of [33] on d-instantons in the original ads5/cft4
correspondence. then, roughly speaking, since each instanton has n4 directions in the
gauge group in which to point, since the action has a normalization factor gss, and
introducing ir by dimensional analysis gives

(3.4)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)d0

this agrees with the supergravity result, as we are taking the rms instanton scale size
as a proxy for z. it also agrees with a relation derived in [29]. (we remark here that
this delocalization is not in contradiction with localization of center of mass modes for
wee-branes without big-branes present which occurs in accordance with the existence
of localized supergravity solutions for wee-branes by themselves. the dierence in the
current context is partly in a factor of order 1/nwee  1. so even though it is possible
that the cm modes may be localized for the wee-brane instantons inside the big-branes,
the fact that the scale sizes are totally delocalized is enough to conclude that we have
agreement with the supergravity results.)

which again agrees with supergravity. in this case, renormalization eects (which are
absent for p < 1) complicate the comparison with [29].

although the case of the d-instanton is rather degenerate, in that the eld theory

we have seen that the supergravity solutions for the parallel intersections are
capable of reproducing the eld theory behaviour, which is of course very sensitive to the
dimension p. conversely, the eld theory analysis is capable of detecting supergravity
no-hair theorems.

4. orthogonal intersections

so far we have discussed the results of [1] only for the prototypical cases dp k dp+4. we
now discuss briey the case of orthogonal intersections, and for purposes of illustration
we discuss the example of d2  d2(0).

the eld theory analysis of the previous section suggests that we can draw
hair/baldness conclusions for the near-horizon geometry of the orthogonal intersections
as well, by t-duality. what matters is the dimensionality p of the intersection theory.
for example, for the d2 d2(0) system which has a 0-dimensional intersection, we
expect baldness. more specically, the mode that used to be the instanton scale size
becomes, under t-duality, what might be termed the blow-up mode. if we trade the
two worldvolume coordinates in each clump of d2-branes (a and b) for a single complex
coordinate w so that we have wa, wb, then the blowup mode  appears in the combined
worldvolume equation as wawb = 2.

now, in the supergravity regime, we have delocalization, but this applies only to the
near-horizon region of the geometry. let us assume that there is no subtlety in matching

baldness/delocalization in intersecting brane systems

9

this near-horizon part onto the asymptotically at part, as the supergravity equations of
motion suggest. then, we can draw conclusions about asymptotically at supergravity
solutions as well. far away from the intersection, we expect each clump of d2-branes
to be localized, as they would be if the other clump were not present. combined with
smearing near the intersection, this gives an overall picture of a supergravity geometry
with a fat neck.

more generally, for the solutions with intersection dimensionality p  2, we expect

to be able to have a skinny neck, but if p  1, we expect a fat neck.

the ansatz we made in setting up our supergravity analysis will not cover the case
of fully localized orthogonal intersections, because it requires one clump of branes to
be delocalized in the worldvolume of the other clump. some progress has been made
in generalizing the ansatz, see for example [15], but to our knowledge the only explicit
solutions obtained so far are perturbative [34]. in that analysis, the ansatz [15] was used,
along with source terms motivated by bion physics of [35, 36] and the solutions were
obtained to second order. for p  1 the second-order perturbations were divergent, even
after very careful attention to boundary conditions and singularities, while for p  2
they were well-behaved. these results lend support to our eld theory expectations.
we await future progress in order to hear the nal verdict, e.g. to nd out how fat is
fat.

the search for various fully localized supergravity solutions is dicult. we would
like to advocate the position that some of these solutions may not be found because
there is a good eld theory reason for them not to exist.

it would be interesting to see how far the results of our work can be generalized.

one area of interest is nonextremal systems; work on this is in progress.
