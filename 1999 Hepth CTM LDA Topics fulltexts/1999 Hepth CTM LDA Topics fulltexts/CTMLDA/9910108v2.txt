abstract

issues related with microcausality violation and continuum limit in the con-
text of (1+1) dimensional scalar eld theory in discretized light-cone quanti-
zation (dlcq) are addressed in parallel with discretized equal time quanti-
zation (detq) and the fact that lorentz invariance and microcausality are
restored if one can take the continuum limit properly is emphasized. in the
free case, it is shown with numerical evidence that the continuum results can
be reproduced from dlcq results for the pauli-jordan function and the real
part of feynman propagator. the contributions coming from k+ near zero
region in these cases are found to be very small. in the interacting case, as-
pects related to the continuum limit of dlcq results in perturbation theory
in momentum space are discussed.

1. introduction

the discretized light-cone quantization (dlcq) [14] was proposed to study nonper-
turbative aspects of eld theories and is extensively used in practical calculations following
ref. [4]. the vacuum is simpler and the treatment of the infrared degrees of freedom is less
complicated in this formalism. dlcq has also been applied in dierent contexts such as
transverse lattice formalism [5] and m-theory [6]. however, at the same time it has some
inherent diculties [7].

in a recent work [8] it is shown that microcausality is violated in the framework of dlcq.
the results of [8] can be summarized as follows. consider the pauli-jordan function in (1+1)
dimensional free scalar theory

(x) =

1
i

[(x), (0)] =

an explicit evaluation leads to,

i z d2k

(x) = 

1
2

(x0)(x2)j0(mx2) = 

1
4

[(x+) + (x)] j0(mx2) ,

(1)

(2)

where j0 is the bessel function and the light-front variables are dened as x = x0x1. as is
evident from eq. (2), (x) is zero in the spacelike region due to microcausality. numerical
results show that (x) is non-vanishing in the space-like region within the box if the box is
considered to be lying along light-front longitudinal direction x (i.e., in dlcq) and hence
violates microcausality. further, the continuum result for (x) is not restored if one uses
dlcq and let l  . similar observation was also made in [9]. this is in contrast to the
case when one uses the box to be lying along x1 (i.e., in detq) where microcausality is not
violated within the box as long as x0 < l and continuum limit is reproduced.

in view of the fact that dlcq is already known to produce reasonable results [10], it
is necessary to investigate further to clarify what actually is going on. in our opinion, the
observation made in ref. [8] is, at best, supercial as we have claried below providing the
actual picture with numerical evidence.

2. comments on microcausality

first of all, it should be noted that when one is using dlcq or detq, one is dealing
with a theory where the raw output is not the ultimate concern. only the continuum limit
of that output is what we are interested in and presumably can be tested with some exper-
iment. in this sense, it is not our primary concern if some symmetry like boost invariance
or even microcausality is violated in the discretized version of the theory. the fact that
microcausality may be violated in dlcq with a xed box length 2l, can be seen trivially
once we assume the periodic boundary condition (l) = (l), since

[(l), (0)] = [(l), (0)] = [(0), (l)],

 [(l), (0)] = 0 ,

(3)

for all time. if the continuum result is our guideline, we should have obtained  i
4 (l) for
x+ = 0 and hence the microcausality that is always maintained in the continuum theory
is not guaranteed to be respected in dlcq with xed l, as also is the case with boost

2

invariance. that precisely is the reason for which one has to remove the l-dependence of
the result obtained from discretized version of the theory (which, in general, may depend on
l) by taking continuum limit to ensure correct physics. therefore, if the continuum result
for pauli-jordan function is not reproduced from dlcq as is claimed in ref. [8], we are
facing a real disaster. in the rest of this work, we show that the situation is not so alarming
and try to clarify the intricacy involved in taking the continuum limit, both in dlcq and
detq. we also compare and contrast the situations in coordinate space and momentum
space.

3. comments on k+ = 0 modes

the pauli-jordan function can be given in the momentum representation by integrating

k0 or k as

(x) =  z 
=  z 

0



sin(kx0  k1x1) ,

dk1
2k
dk+
2k+ sin(kx+/2 + k+x/2) ,

(4)

where k = q(k1)2 + m2 and k = m2/k+.

notice that the integrand in eq. (4) is highly oscillatory for k+ near 0 in contrast to the
corresponding equal-time case when k1 near 0 as long as the mass is not zero. in general,
understanding the role of k+ = 0 modes is very crucial in light-front quantization [7]. the
observed discrepancy between dlcq result and the continuum one for (x) is generally
believed to be due to the elimination of the zero mode (k+ = 0, the accumulation point)
in dlcq , at least in the case of free theory [8,9]. to see the actual contribution to (x),
we have performed numerically the integration of eq. (4) separately for dierent k+ regions
and the results are shown in fig. 1. it is clear that the contribution coming from the region
where k+ is very small is negligible compared to that coming from the other region.

fig. 1: plot of pauli-jordan function showing contributions from dierent regions of k+ for
x = 2.0 and m2 = 1. the ranges of k+ integrations are (a) 105 to 103, (b) 103 to
1.0, (c) 1.0 to 103 and (d) 105 to 103, this curve is the same as that of eq. (2).

though it is not possible to reach k+ = 0 numerically, it can be seen that the total result
matches with the exact result (eq. (2)) suggesting that the contribution from the region
k+  105 is even smaller and insignicant. so the discrepancy does not seem to be caused
by the zero modes. our numerical result in the continuum agrees with the assertion in ref.
[7], that zero mode is not an accumulation point for the pauli-jordan function. for more
discussions on the role of zero modes see ref. [1,7].

4. continuum limit

the discretized versions of (x) by restricting spatial coordinates, l  x1, x  l and

using periodic boundary condition for the eld  are given by,

et (x) = 

lc(x) = 

n

n

xn=n
xn=1

1

2nl

sin(nx0  nx1/l) ,

1

2n

sin(k

n x+/2 + nx/l) ,

(5)

(6)

where, in principle, n   and for nth discrete momentum mode energies are given by
n = qn22/l2 + m2 and k

n = m2l/2n respectively.

4

in general, at the end of any calculation in the discretized version of the theory one
is expected to get back the continuum result by taking n   and l   limit. for
practical computations, it means that one has to take n suciently large for any particular
l value such that the summation saturates (in the sense that it does not change appreciably
if the value of n is increased). it turns out that if n/l ratio is large then the saturation
occurs. in all the results presented n has been taken suciently large so that the results
are independent of n.

now, in dlcq in coordinate space, taking the continuum limit is a little tricky. to
understand things properly, we perform the summation in eq. (5) and eq. (6) numerically
and study their behavior by changing the parameters involved, namely, n, l and also the
space-time points at which it is calculated.

first, we present the observation made in detq. in fig. 2(a), we have plotted et in
the continuum theory. from fig. 2(b), we can clearly see that for a particular l(> x0) and
for xed x0, et actually oscillates about the continuum value and converges to it (at least
within the box) as we increase n suciently. since continuum result is reproduced within
the box, we see that microcausality is not violated within the box, i.e., yields zero for spacelike
region. outside the box it is a dierent story altogether, since we just get periodic copies
which, of course, diers from the continuum result. now, increasing only l with n xed to
earlier value, the result again starts oscillating around the continuum value and one could
even get widely varying result (non-zero for spacelike region) if l is suciently increased as
shown in fig. 2(c) (periodic copies are not shown there).

this, of course, does not mean that microcausality is violated. it only means that we
are far from continuum limit. on the other hand, if one increases l and n simultaneously
keeping the ratio n/l large one gets the same continuum result within the box. thus,

5

the eect of taking l to innity this way simply removes the periodic copies and gives the
continuum result everywhere.

these are, of course, very well known results. the main point that we want to drive
home here is that if we are somewhat near the continuum limit, then et actually oscillates
around the exact result and thus, taking an average, one could obtain good agreement with

the continuum result.
point as a function of l. we see clearly that it uctuates in a very small range where any
value is actually close to the continuum result and hence, the average value in that range
is a good approximation for the continuum limit. further, we notice that as l increases
et converges slowly but appreciably towards a particular value which is its true continuum
limit.

in the case of lc, the situation is dierent.

in particular, for a xed l the result
stabilizes as we increase n, but no way near result of the continuum limit within the box,
as is also observed in ref. [8].

thus, this result on its own is unphysical in the sense that we are unable to test them by
some experiment and it is not surprising to observe that microcausality is violated (since it
is non-zero in the space-like region). now, as in fig. 3(a), we show the similar plot for lc
in fig. 3(b). we clearly see the striking dierence in this case, namely, it varies in a wider
range of values and shows hardly any evidence of converging to some value. nevertheless,
it shares one property of et , namely, it uctuates around some average value. taking the
clue from earlier plots it suggests that the average value about which it is uctuating might
be a good approximation for the continuum limit for lc. in fact, it turns out to be the
case. we have shown this fact in figs. 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c). here, at dierent x+ and x, we
have rst calculated these averages for various box length l(> x+, x) with large n/l ratio
and plotted them and the results remarkably agree with the continuum results. also the
discretized result is zero in the spacelike region. the fact that continuum result does not
care whether we have imposed periodic or anti-periodic boundary conditions, is also shown
in these plots.

6

thus, we see that even though an individual result with xed l looks unphysical, an
assembly of such results for various box length l can be used to extract sensible result in
dlcq and the microcausality, which is required for any sensible physical result, is in no
danger here.

we have also veried that the same feature is evident in feynman propagator f (x)
as well. imaginary part of the feynman propagator being connected to the pauli-jordan

in fig. 5, we have shown the dlcq result which is obtained by using eq. (8) for various
l and taking averages as we did earlier.
it is again in remarkable agreement with the
continuum result.

so far we have restricted ourselves to position space. the situation is completely dier-
ent if calculations are performed in momentum space where the continuum limit is easily
achieved as discussed in the next section. this is not surprising as we see that the fourier
transforms of the dlcq results are the discretized versions of the continuum results. fourier

it is the discretized version of the fourier transform of the continuum result (i.e.,  1

similarly, the fourier transform of (x) for x+ = 0 in dlcq is also the discretized version
of the fourier transform of  1

5. interacting theory

till now we have considered pauli-jordan function in (1+1) dimensional free scalar eld
theory and have shown through numerical analysis that one gets the continuum result irre-
spective of using detq or dlcq. in this section, we investigate the situation by adding
a 4-interaction. in particular, we calculate a scattering amplitude in perturbation theory
in dlcq and compare its continuum limit with the exact result. we shall observe that
the continuum limit is obtained much more directly for such entities which are functions in
momentum space compared to pauli-jordan function, which is a function in position space.

we consider one loop scattering process in 4 theory. the feynman diagram shown in the

where s = (p1 + p2)2 and y = q+

s < 4m2. in old-fashioned light-front hamiltonian perturbation theory, the second diagram
(tf i(b)) in the right hand side is absent. dlcq result for the rst diagram can be easily
calculated and is given by

we have used the anti-periodic boundary condition here to avoid the zero mode problem
which is present in the interacting theory with periodic boundary condition. here p + =
p+
1 + p+
2 = h l/ , m 2 = p +p  = kh and qn = (2n  1) /l,
with k and n being integer. also, since internal lines carry momenta which are odd multiple
of /l, k should be even and decides the value of n, the highest mode in the sum. note
that the result in eq. (11) is independent of l and the continuum limit is simply obtained
by increasing n, (i.e., k here) if it stabilizes. it can be easily veried that dlcq gives the
continuum result without any problem as correctly mentioned in ref. [7]. here we explicitly
show that in perturbative 4 theory dlcq in momentum space is free from zero mode
problem and at the same time it gives us a comparative picture of dlcq in position and
momentum space.

in old-fashioned equal-time hamiltonian perturbation theory, contribution comes from
both of the time-ordered diagrams. in this case, deqt result is given by tf i = tf i(a) +tf i(b),
where,

the scattering amplitude in this case depends on l. however, when the box length l and the
ratio n
l are large the result is independent of l and agrees with the continuum result. the
table below compares the results in some arbitrary units as obtained by dierent formalisms.
for detq, the calculations are done with n/l = 50 and l = 5. but for dlcq, stability
in k depends on the mass, for small mass k should be larger than that for large mass (e.g.,
for m2 = 7, k  15, for m2 = 0.1, k  80). for higher order of accuracy one should take
larger values of n/l and k.

6. discussion and conclusions

in this work, rst, we considered pauli-jordan function in (1+1) dimensional free scalar
eld theory both in equal time and light-front formulations and their corresponding dis-
cretized versions. we showed that the microcausality (like the boost invariance) which is
required for any sensible theory is not guaranteed to be maintained in the discretized version
of the theory. in practice, one is actually interested in the continuum limit of the results
obtained in discretized version of the theory, which one can presumably test in some ex-
periment. in general, one expects to obtain the continuum result by taking n   and
l  . in detq, in coordinate space, for suciently large value of n and for any xed
l, continuum result is reproduced within the box as long as x0  l. thus taking l  
limit only removes the periodic copies. in contrast, same procedure does not give the contin-
uum result even within the box in dlcq. nevertheless, we observe that as a function of l,
dlcq result actually uctuates around the continuum result even when l is very large. we
noted the fact that taking an average value from an assembly of such values obtained with
various dierent l reproduces the continuum result with remarkable agreement. we have
also obtained the continuum limit of the real part of the propagator starting from dlcq
result. thus obtaining continuum result ensures microcausality as well as boost invariance.
note that the pauli-jordan function or the feynman propagator are considered to be the
functions in position space here. in contrast, we showed with a specic example that in the
perturbative calculations of diagrams in interacting theory where calculations are performed
in momentum space, dlcq result becomes independent of l and the continuum result is
obtained simply by increasing n suciently.
