abstract

starting from the fierz transform of the two-avour t hooft interaction (a
four-fermion lagrangian with antisymmetric lorentz tensor interaction terms
augmented by an njl type lorentz scalar interaction responsible for dynam-
ical symmetry breaking and quark mass generation), we show that: (1) anti-
symmetric tensor nambu-goldstone bosons appear provided that the scalar
and tensor couplings stand in the proportion of two to one, which ratio ap-
pears naturally in the fierz transform of the two-avour t hooft interaction;
(2) non-abelian vector gauge bosons coupled to this system acquire a non-
zero mass. axial-vector elds do not mix with antisymmetric tensor elds, so
there is no mass shift there.

i. introduction

it has long been known that four-fermion contact interactions of the nambu and jona-
lasinio [njl] type can lead to dynamical symmetry breaking along with associated com-
posite spinless nambu-goldstone [ng] bosons [1]. such interactions have been extended to
include all but six of the 16 independent dirac matrix bilinears. the six still unexplored
terms correspond to the antisymmetric [a.s.]
tensor  = (i/2) [, ] self-interaction,
which leads after bosonisation to antisymmetric tensor bosonic excitations [2]. elementary
antisymmetric tensor elds were introduced into eld theory by ogievetskii and polubarinov
[3], into string theory by kalb and ramond [4] and into models of connement by nambu
[5], but their origin was not specied.

the purpose of this paper is to show that: 1) a model that combines the njl dynami-
cal symmetry breaking with an antisymmetric tensor quark self-interaction, obtained from
the two-avour t hooft interaction by a fierz rearrangement, leads to massless composite
antisymmetric tensor and pseudotensor ng bosons at a.s. tensor coupling equal to one half
of the scalar coupling constant gt = 1
2 gs; 2) vector boson coupled to this system acquires
a non-zero mass.

ii. preliminaries

we shall work with a chirally symmetric eld theory described by

lenjl = [i/] + gsh( )2 + ( i5 )2i

+ gth( )2 + ( i5  )2i ,

(1)

where  is a two-component (isospinor) dirac eld. we shall have no need for the pseu-
doscalar term in the rst line of eq. (1) in the forthcoming analysis, but keep it to preserve
the underlying sul(2) sur(2) chiral symmetry. the antisymmetric tensor self-interaction
in the second line of eq. (1) preserves this chiral symmetry, but violates the axial baryon
number ua(1) conservation [6]. [this self-interaction is related to the two-avour t hooft
interaction [7] by a fierz identity.]

there is another, hidden symmetry of the a.s.

tensor term (the second line in the
lagrangian (1) that has not been explored in this context heretofore and which we shall call
the duality symmetry. it is induced by the identity

5 =

i
2

 = i

 = i

which allows the second line in the lagrangian (1) to be written as

gth (1 + ) ( )2 + ( i5  )2 + ( i5 )2 + (1 + ) (   )2i .

(2)

(3)

where  is an arbitrary (real) duality-symmetry gauge xing parameter. manifestly, phys-
ical predictions of this model must be independent of . as a particular consequence of
duality the a.s. tensor term in the lagrangian (1) vanishes identically in the abelian, i.e.
one-avour (nf = 1) case:

2

gh( )2 + ( i5)2i = 0 .

(4)

we shall have to pay particular attention to maintaining the duality-symmetry of this theory
in the approximations used here.

the non-perturbative dynamics of the model, to leading order in 1/nc, are described
by two schwinger-dyson [sd] equations: (i) the gap equation, fig. 1.a; and (ii) the bethe-
salpeter [bs] equation, fig. 1.b. our model has three parameters: two positive coupling
constants gs, gt of dimension (mass)2 and a regulating cut-o  that determines the mass
scale. in the hartree approximation, i.e., to leading order in 1/nc, the gap equation

m = 16incgs(z

d4p
(2)4

m

p2  m2)reg

,

(5)

for nc colours, regulated following either pauli and villars (pv), or dimensionally [8], estab-
lishes a relation between the constituent quark mass m and the free parameters gs and .
[regularization of the quantity in braces is indicated by its subscript.] this relation is not
one-to-one, however: there is a double continuum of allowed gs and  values that yield the
same nontrivial solution m to the gap equation. one of these degeneracies can be eliminated
by xing the spinless (0) nambu-goldstone [ng] boson decay constant fp at its observed
value.

iii. bethe-salpeter equation: antisymmetric polarization

tensors

the second schwinger-dyson equation is an inhomogeneous bethe-salpeter (bs) equa-

tion

d = 2g + 2g  d,

(6)

describing the scattering of quarks and antiquarks, fig. 1.b. because there is potential for
mixing between the channels all the objects in the bs equation are 4  4 matrices. here g
is the (eective) t coupling constant matrix

g = gt   1 0
0 1!

corresponding to the interaction lagrangian

(8)

gth(  )2 + ( i5)2i = 0 ,

parametrized by a couple of parameters ,  in each isospin channel. here 1 is a 2  2
unit matrix (corresponding to two channels), the upper submatrix describes the t and
the lower one the pt channel, and  is the a.s. polarization tensor matrix whose matrix
elements we must evaluate.

to leading order in nc, the polarization (k) is just a single-loop diagram. the form
of the interaction in eq. (1) gives rise to scattering in four channels: the familiar isovector-
pseudoscalar (pion) channel and the isoscalar-scalar (sigma) channel and the corresponding
two antisymmetric (pseudo-)tensor channels.

antisymmetric polarization tensors to leading order in nc, the polarization (k) is
just a single-loop diagram. the form of the interaction in eq. (1) gives rise to four polariza-
tion functions: two (isovector and isoscalar) in the antisymmetric tensor and pseudo-tensor
channels each. we start with the a.s. tensor polarization:

 it,ab

; = it

;(q2)ab = 2ncabz

d4p
(2)4 tr[i s(p + q)is(p)]

and similarly for the pseudotensor polarization

 ipt,ab

; = ipt

;(q2)ab = 2ncabz

d4p
(2)4 tr[5s(p + q)5s(p)] .

there are two independent a.s. tensors,

t i
, =

t ii
, =

[gg  gg]

so we may write the polarization tensors as follows

these results are both theoretically important and valuable in the evaluation of the polar-
ization functions.

we evaluate the traces in four dimensions, so as to avoid the ambiguities of the denition
of 5 matrix in non-integer dimensions and to conform with the duality requirements (14).

eq. (16c) describes the goldberger-treiman [gt] relation, which is a chiral ward identity
and happens to hold in most regularization schemes, even when they violate other ward
identities. the set of a.s. tensor polarization functions (15) requires

m2 {i(0)}reg = {j}reg

(17)

in order to satisfy the duality constraint eq. (14), however. this is the same condition that
converts the gauge-variant sharp euclidean space cuto vector polarization function v
into the gauge invariant [g.i.] one in eq. (15). this procedure eliminates the quadratically
divergent integral from the vector polarization function v(s), ref. [9], and thus makes sure
that the photon remains massless. eq. (17) holds in the pauli and villars (pv) scheme
for only one value of the cuto , and even the signs of the two sides of this equation
in the pv scheme coincide only in a narrow region of cuto  and mass m values. with
dimensional regularization, however,

holds as an identity. with the help of the gt relation, however, eq. (17) can be written as

(19)

as a consequence of dual symmetry we are facing here two alternatives: (1) imaginary decay
constant fp and composite boson-fermion coupling constant gp, or (2) negative four-fermion
coupling constant gs. we choose the latter. in other words, with g.i. and duality-invariant
regularizations, such as the dimensional one, the sign of the scalar coupling constant gs in
eq. (1) is opposite to the usual one. as pointed out earlier, this coupling constant is not an
observable, so we may ip its sign with impunity so long as observables, such as the fermion
mass and the p.s. decay constant fp remain unaected, which is precisely the case here.
this seems a small price to pay for a regularization scheme that is consistent with the gauge

5

and duality symmetries. moreover, this prescription also allows us to use the dimensional
regularization in the njl model.

upon enforcing the relation (19) in eqs. (15), we nd

we shall call these results gauge invariant a.s. tensor polarization functions and use them
forthwith as the only option.

also connects the a.s. polarization tensor to the a.s. polarization pseudo-tensor and hence
to the mixing of the two modes via the nonvanishing pt-t transition matrix element [me]

hence we see that the denominators are duality-gauge invariant, but not so the numerators.

duality constraints on the solutions to the bs equation now remember that a t channel
propagator can be turned into a pt one by the duality transformation. hence the complete
propagators are given by



t(g) = dt(g) + dpt(g)
d
pt(g) = dpt(g) + dt(g) ,
d



(24)

respectively. as we shall show below, these two complete propagators are duality-gauge
invariant and they describe two distinct particles in the sense that their parities are opposite.
these two particles couple dierently to particles with other spins and parities, as will be
shown in the next section, although they are produced by one and the same interaction.

duality transformation turns the tensor propagator into a rescaled pseudotensor one,

with the opposite sign of the coupling constant:

and similarly

pt(g) .

these imply the following identities

 dt(g) = dpt(g)
 dpt(g) = dt(g) .

inserting these results into eq. (24) we nd

hence we see that the total tensor and pseudotensor propagators are not identical, as some
have conjectured, but are related to each other by the duality transformation.

7

as a check of our procedure we see that for a vanishing interaction lagrangian (4), i.e.,
with  =  the net propagation of the true (total) a.s. tensor, or a.s. pseudotensor modes
also vanishes

t( = ) = d



t( = ) = 0 ,

(29)

moreover, as stated above, for tensor t hooft interaction lagrangian (3), i.e., with  6= 
the total t and pt mode propagators (29) are duality-gauge invariant as they depend only
on the duality-gauge invariant linear combination   .

2some doubts have been expressed with regard to the ng nature of these massless poles. these
doubts ought to be allayed by the fact that the t, pt states acquire a mass upon explicit breaking
of the chiral symmetry by current quark masses. this mass equals the pion mass under the same
circumstances.

holds, which is equivalent to g1
s . note that precisely this ratio of the
two coupling constants arises when one takes the fierz transform of the nf = 2 t hooft
interaction [7] as the interaction lagrangian. the relations (32), (34) bear remarkable
similarity to analogous relations for the vector mass and coupling constant in the enjl
model [9]. in other words, eq. (34) denes a critical point in the space of a.s. t coupling
constants in this theory. change of gt or gs can lead to (phase) transitions to other phases
of the theory, and thence to tachyons.

v. the higgs effect

by replacing the partial derivative  with the covariant one d =   iea , in the
lagrangian (1) and adding the gauge eld lagrangian to it, we can couple a gauge eld a
to the fermions in this model. we will work in a class of covariant gauges parametrized by
a gauge xing parameter . that amounts to adding the gauge-xing term

as the bare gauge boson propagator. this propagator is dressed by vacuum polarization
correction parametrized by the gauge invariant tensor

according to the schwinger-dyson equation

(q) = (cid:16)qq  gq2(cid:17) (q2)

d(q) = d(q) + d(q)(q)d(q) .

schwinger observed [10] that when the vacuum polarization function (q2) has a simple pole

(40)

acquires a nite gauge-invariant dressed mass mv determined by the residue of  at the

(41)

this is also the way the conventional higgs mechanism operates [11]. we see in eq. (40)
that it is absolutely crucial for (q) to have a pole at precisely q2 = 0, or else the dressed
gauge boson remains massless.

that this is indeed the case in the present theory, we can see by constructing the vector
polarization tensor , see fig. 2. for that we need the vector-pseudotensor [v-pt] tran-
sition matrix element v p t

pseudotensor ng bosons.

vi. discussion and conclusions

in conclusion, we have shown that: 1) a non-abelian symmetry model with dynamical
symmetry breaking of the njl type and an antisymmetric tensor fermion self-interaction
leads to massless composite antisymmetric tensor ng bosons at tensor coupling gt = 1
2 gs;
2 )2 , where e is
and 2) vector gauge bosons coupled to this system acquire a mass of
the gauge coupling constant and fp is the scalar (higgs) v.e.v.. such a result may be termed
an antisymmetric tensor schwinger-higgs mechanism with composite a.s. t states. the
distinction from the usual (scalar) higgs mechanism is that there is no a.s. t higgs particle.
a similar eect with elementary a.s. t elds has been recognized by stuckelberg [12].

q1+( gp

3efp

analogous higgs mechanism for axial-vector gauge elds with the original njl model has
been discussed by freundlich and lurie [13]. the freundlich-lurie scheme is the dynamical
symmetry breaking mechanism currently used in many top-condensation models of the
electroweak interactions [14]. the parity of the would-be ng boson (the higgs-kibble
ghost) is unimportant in applications to electroweak interactions, where the gauge elds
are one part vector and one part axial-vector, but it is crucial in applications to qcd, which
theory conserves parity and whose quanta (gluons) are vector particles. phenomenological

10

consequences of an a.s. tensor higgs mechanism as applied to the salam-weinberg model
remain to be worked out. applications to the connement problem in qcd are being
worked on. last, but not least, this new a.s tensor higgs mechanism may have applications
in hadronic eective theories [15].

figures

fig. 1. the two schwinger-dyson equations determining the dynamics of this model in the
hartree + rpa approximation: (a) the one-body, or gap equation; and (b) the two-body, or
bethe-salpeter equation. the thin solid line is the bare, or current quark, the heavy solid line is
the constituent quark and the double solid line is either the composite antisymmetric tensor-, or
pseudo-tensor boson.

fig. 2.

the vector current polarization tensor . the wavy lines are the yang-mills
vector bosons, solid lines are constituent quarks and the double solid line is the antisymmetric
pseudo-tensor boson.
