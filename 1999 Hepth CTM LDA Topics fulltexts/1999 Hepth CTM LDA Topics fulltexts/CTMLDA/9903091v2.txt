abstract

we consider so(4)  so(6) invariant type iib string solution describing d3-branes su-
perposed with d-instantons homogeneously distributed over d3-brane world-volume. in
the near d3-brane horizon limit this background interpolates between ads5  s5 space
in uv and at space (with non-constant dilaton and rr scalar) in ir. generalizing the
ads/cft conjecture we suggest that type iib string in this geometry is dual to n = 4
sym theory in a state with a constant self-dual gauge eld background. the semiclassical
string representation for the wilson factor implies connement with eective string tension
depending on constant d-instanton density parameter. this provides a simple example of
type iib string  gauge theory duality with clear d-brane and gauge theory interpretation.

1. introduction

recent discovery of a remarkable connection between gravity and gauge theory de-
scriptions of d-branes gives a hope of eventual string-theoretic description of properties
of strongly coupled gauge theories such as connement [1] (see [2] for reviews). the best
understood example of this duality [3,4,5] based on d3-branes relates n = 4 super ym
theory and type iib string in ads5  s5 space. to clarify the meaning of the duality in
the context of type iib string theory and to extend it to non-conformal (and less super-
symmetric) cases one may study various modications of the pure d3-brane background,
in particular:
(i) add extra energy to the branes, i.e. consider near-extremal d3-branes; the correspond-
ing gauge theory is then in a thermal state (see, e.g., [6,7]); (ii) add d7-branes breaking
supersymmetry on the gauge theory side to n = 2 [8,9]; (iii) break supersymmetry com-
pletely by adding dilaton charge as in the solution of [10,11] (which is a special case of the
solutions in [12] with tachyon eld turned o),1 or, more generally, exciting other scalar
elds in s5-compactied 5d theory, see [14] and references there.

here we propose another example which is similar to the one in [10,11] and [12] in that
the background preserves so(4)so(6) symmetry but is simpler having a clear interpreta-
tion on both supergravity and gauge theory sides. we consider a homogeneous distribution
of d-instantons on a large number of coincident d3-branes. this corresponds to modify-
ing the d3-brane background by adding a rr scalar charge together with (equal) dilaton
charge in a way that preserves 1/2 of supersymmetry. the resulting supergravity solution
is a limit of superposition [15] of d3-brane [16] and d(-1)-brane [17,18] backgrounds. the
d3+d(-1) conguration is t-dual to d4+d0 or d5+d1 marginal bound state backgrounds
and preserves 1/4 (1/2 near the horizon of d3-brane) of supersymmetry.

in the present case the d-instanton charge is homogeneously smeared over the d3-
brane world-volume instead of being localized as in [19].2 the corresponding gauge theory
is not simply the vacuum n = 4 sym theory perturbed by a single instanton (with
perturbations of the supergravity d3-brane and gauge eld backgrounds related as in
[19,21]) but rather is a dierent n = 2 supersymmetric state described by a homogeneous
self-dual gauge eld background. the latter is assumed to be averaged in some way to
preserve the euclidean so(4) and translational invariance. its order parameter (instanton
density) is kept xed in the large n limit.

following [3] we conjecture that the type iib string theory in near-horizon d3+d(-1)
geometry is dual to n = 4 sym theory in such constant self-dual gauge eld background.

1 similar dilatonic solutions were discussed also in [13].
2 a limiting case when d-instanton is put at the center of the euclidean ads5 space but is still
localized in the boundary coordinates and thus corresponds to a very large (i.e., approximately

homogeneous) instanton gauge eld in the boundary sym theory was recently discussed in [20].

1

this conjecture is consistent with analogous correspondence between the supergravity and
gauge theory descriptions of d3-branes in at space with additional gauge eld distribu-
tions on them. adding a self-dual gauge eld on a d3-brane in at space is equivalent to
adding d-instanton charge [22,23]. the remaining supersymmetry ensures that the leading
1
x4 f 4 long- and short- distance interaction potentials between branes (computed in classi-
cal supergravity and in one-loop sym theory) agree [24] like they do in the d0-brane case
[25]. this implies that the (smeared) d3+d(-1) supergravity conguration corresponds to
a d3-brane with a (homogeneous) self-dual background gauge eld.

though this example is somewhat unphysical (being based on a euclidean background
which usually has a well-dened meaning only as a virtual conguration in the path in-
tegral) our main motivation is that it provides a clear setting for testing certain aspects
of string theory  gauge theory duality. as in other similar cases [12,10,11,14] here the
background interpolates between a regular uv ads5  s5 space (conformal gauge theory)
and a singular ir background. a remarkable simplication which happens in d3+d(-1)
case (in addition to a transparent analytic form of the supergravity solution) is that the
ir limit of the string-frame metric is actually at,3 with the singularity of the background
residing only in the dilaton eld. assuming the string-theory representation for the wil-
son factor [26] that immediately leads (in the semiclassical approximation) to the area law
behaviour.

this prediction of the string in curved space  gauge theory duality is consistent with
expectations that gauge theory in a constant self-dual background [27,28,29,30] should be
(partially) conning. the connement should be simply a consequence of the presence of
a non-trivial background eld (implying, e.g., that propagators do not have poles in the
complex energy plane [30]). we nd that the eective string tension following from the
curved space picture depends indeed only on the background gauge eld order parameter
and not on the gauge coupling.

we shall start in section 2 by presenting the d3+d(-1) supergravity background. the
corresponding gauge theory state described by a self-dual background will be considered
in section 3. the relation between with the supergravity solution and gauge theory state
will be illustrated in section 4 by sym eective action interpretation of the d3-brane
probe action in the d3+d(-1) background. in section 5 we shall use the dual string theory
description to compute the wilson loop factor using the semiclassical fundamental string
action and demonstrate that it exhibits area law behaviour. in section 6 we shall present
analogous discussion of the t hooft loop factor based on the d-string action and show
that magnetic monopoles are screened at large separations. section 7 will contain some
concluding remarks. in appendix we shall consider perturbations of the background elds
near the d3-brane + d-instanton supergravity background and demonstrate that scalar
eld perturbations do not, in general, decouple from the metric one. while one linear
combination of the dilaton and rr scalar perturbations still satises the massless scalar
equation in ads5  s5 (so there are still gapless excitations in this background), the
second combination mixes with graviton and should have complicated dynamics, reecting
the presence of the self-dual gauge eld background on the gauge theory side.

3 the ir limit of the einstein-frame metric is again ads5  s5.

2. supergravity picture: d3+d(-1) background

a simple example of a deformation of the d3-brane solution of type iib supergravity
by non-trivial scalar eld backgrounds is obtained by switching on a rr scalar charge and
balancing it by a dilaton charge to preserve 1/2 of supersymmetry. the resulting exact
solution representing a marginal bound state of d3-brane and a (smeared) d-instanton is
a non-trivial example of a type iib brane intersection conguration parametrised by two
harmonic functions. it has the following string-frame metric [15]

ds2

10 = (h1)1/2(h1/2

3 dxsdxs) ,

(2.1)

where m = 1, ..., 4, s = 5, ..., 10, and h1 and h3 are the harmonic functions depending
only on xs. in addition to the self-dual 5-form background (c1234 = h1
3 ) representing the
d3-brane charge we have the non-trivial dilaton  = 0 +  and rr scalar backgrounds4

e = h1 ,

c = (h1)1  1 .

(2.2)

this solution is t-dual to d4 + d0 or d5 + d1 congurations. the total stress tensor of
the two scalar elds is zero so that the einstein frame metric remains the same as in the
d3-brane case.

since the d-instanton is smeared over the 3-brane world-volume the two harmonic

functions have the same structure (r2 = xsxs)

the supergravity approximation applies when derivatives of the elds remain small in

(2.6)

and when the eective string coupling is small, i.e. r  (q)1/4.

let us now consider the following generalization of the decoupling limits of [32,3,33]

  0 ,

{u =

, , q} = xed .

(2.7)

this limit is equivalent to taking a special solution without 1 in the 3-brane harmonic func-
tion h3 (and making a coordinate redenition). the dilaton and rr scalar are expressed
(2.2) in terms of the function h1 which remains nite in this limit6

10 is still ads5  s5 as in the
the corresponding einstein-frame metric ds2
d3-brane case. as in the pure d3-brane case [3], the factor  cancels out in the classical
string action which thus remains nite in the limit (2.7).

e = e/2ds2

like the ads5  s5 einstein frame metric, the string frame metric (2.9) is completely

regular: near the core r  0 (i.e. in the ir region u  0) it becomes at
1/2

ds2

10 = q1/2(cid:18)dxmdxm + dz2 + z2d2
5(cid:19) ,

(2.10)

note that the overall coecient (eective string tension) is just q1/2, i.e. does not depend
on . the full d3+d(-1) background is, however, singular because of the blow-up of the
dilaton at u = 0. this is the same behaviour as in the case of the pure d-instanton
background [17].

the background (2.9) thus interpolates between ads5  s5 at u =  (uv) and at
space with singular dilaton near u = 0 (ir), while in the absence of d-instantons (q = 0)
the ads5  s5 space describes both regions. the constant instanton density parameter
q breaks conformal invariance in the ir region. similar interpolating backgrounds (with
singular metrics in the ir) were found in [12,10,11,14]. an attractive feature of the present
case is its simplicity (not unrelated to remaining supersymmetry) and clear identication

of the corresponding dual gauge theory  n = 4 sym with a constant self-dual background
(section 3). this interpretation is supported by the relation between the classical action
of a d3-brane probe moving in this geometry and the sym one-loop eective action in the
corresponding gauge eld background (see section 4).

the type iib string theory in the background (2.9),(2.2) is thus conjectured to be dual
to a certain n = 2 supersymmetric, and so(4) so(6) and translationally invariant state
of u (n ) n = 4 sym theory (which may be equivalent to some n = 2 supersymmetric
ym theory with matter which is conformal in the uv). symmetries of the string theory
should therefore imply certain symmetries on the gauge theory side. the string theory
and gauge theory are parametrised by , n, q, v4 (or gs, n, k, v4).

one obvious string symmetry is t -duality. the original d3+d(-1) background
(2.1),(2.2) with standard (r  ) asymptotically at region is covariant under t-
duality along all four 3-brane world-volume directions: t -duality interchanges h3 with
h1, i.e. q3 with q(4)
1.7 the limiting background (2.9),(2.2),(2.8) (and c1234 = h1
3 )
is parametrised by asymmetric combination of harmonic functions (h3  h3  1 =
2u4 , h1 = 1 + q
u4 ) and thus changes its form under the t -duality. assuming that all
four directions are compact with equal radii a, xm = am, m  m +2 (i.e. v4 = (2a)4)
and that the dual angular coordinate is m  m + 2, the string metric t -dual to (2.9) is
g10( x)2 + ...)
found to be (in terms of the string lagrangian 1

the small u limit of (2.11) is again a at space region (cf.(2.10)). using the expression

8 this is the same conclusion as in the near-horizon d3-brane case which is mapped by t -
duality into the near-horizon limit of smeared d-instanton [34]. though the ads5 metric with

compact xm is singular at u = 0, string theory is supposed to resolve this singularity and should

be dual to sym theory on a 4-torus.

i.e. the duality corresponds to interchanging k  n . measured in terms of the string

metric the dual radius is as = 1qa (near u = 0 the eective string tension is
2 , see (2.10)).
the gauge theory volume is dened, however, as the volume of the boundary theory in
the u   ads5  s5 space limit and remains unchanged, v4 = (2a)4 (we consider the
simplest rectangular 4-torus). note that near u = 0 and u =  the ratio of the eective
string couplings e

we are thus led to the conclusion that string t -duality implies an equivalence relation
between u (n ) gauge theory state parametrized by k (and gs(u)) and u (k) gauge theory
state parametrized by n (and gs(u)). given that k may be interpreted (section 3) as
an instanton number in u (n ) gauge theory, this suggests a relation to the nahm duality
which maps a charge k, u (n ) self-dual solution on a 4-torus to a charge n , u (k) self-dual
solution on a dual 4-torus [35]. nahm duality was previously discussed in connection with
t -duality in string theory in at background in, e.g., [36,37,38]. in the present context
of the curved space string theory  gauge theory duality conjecture one indeed seems
to see why ym theory (via the nahm transformation) still knows about t -duality,
cf.
[37]. here we are getting not just a relation between two classical self-dual yang-
mills backgrounds, but an equivalence between two quantum gauge theories (which is
reminiscent of some known dualities between supersymmetric gauge theories [39]).

the forms of the dilaton and rr scalar (2.2),(2.8) suggest the following expressions

for the ir ow of the sym couplings

(u) = (1 +

q
u4 ) ,

(u) = (1 +

q
u4 )1  1 .

(2.14)

similar power-like running of the dilaton was found also in [10,11]. in the n = 2 gauge
theory related to d7 + d3 brane conguration [8] analogous ir running of dilaton may be
explained by instanton corrections (see [9] and refs. there). here it should be induced by
the presence of a constant self-dual eld condensate.9

the atness of the u  0 limit of the metric suggests that the ir limit of gauge
theory should be described by type iib string theory in at space (with additional dilaton
and rr scalar and 4-tensor backgrounds being invisible in a semiclassical approximation).
that obviously leads to the area law behaviour of the wilson factor (see section 5).

9 instanton contributions do not produce ir rg ow in the n = 4 sym theory in the vacuum

state [40].

6

the major question, however, is whether the background (2.9),(2.2),(2.8) may be
extrapolated all the way into the ir region u  0. we expect that due to its remaining
supersymmetry this background, like ads5  s5, is actually an exact (all order in )
solution of the classical type iib string theory. then one may relax the conditions (2.6)
but there is still the condition that the eective string coupling e should remain small,
i.e.

u  u ,

u  (q)1/4 = 2(

k
n v4

)1/4 .

(2.15)

if q is not constrained, we may allow u to be suciently small to probe the ir limit
and still have weak string coupling to ignore string loop corrections. this will be our
assumption below. u  (v4)1/4 may be interpreted as an ir energy cuto on the gauge
theory side.

3. gauge theory picture

the gauge eld theory counterpart of the supergravity solution discussed above is
the n = 4 su (n ) sym theory in a certain (non-vacuum) state which may be de-
scribed as a stochastic averaging of a constant homogeneous self-dual background (see,
e.g., [27,28,29,30]).10 namely, we shall demand that in such state11

< fmn >= 0 , < tr(fmnfmnfmnf mn) >= 0 ,

< tr(fmnfmn) >=

162
v4

k , (3.1)

where a nite volume v4 will be used as an ir cuto. we shall assume that this n = 2
supersymmetric state may obtained by some averaging over dierent 4d directions so that
k is the only order parameter, i.e. that the euclidean group  so(4)+translations  is
unbroken (while p- and t- invariances are obviously broken). indeed, the supergravity so-
lution has the same 4d euclidean group symmetry and depends only on one extra constant
q which is related to k.

for the purpose of comparing with supergravity such state may be represented simply

by (a stochastic averaging of) a constant self-dual abelian background such that

(3.4)

again, q will be the only order parameter visible on the supergravity side, i.e. the gauge
theory state is dened by averaging over all elds satisfying fmn = fmn and (3.2).12
introducing a background eld does not change uv niteness property of the n = 4
sym theory, but may, of course, modify ir behaviour. indeed, the propagators of massless
fermions and o-diagonal gluons in the self-dual background exhibit connement-type
(no-pole) behaviour [30]. the connement on the sym side is caused by the background
eld [29,30]. the dual string/gravity description will lead to an area law for the wilson
factor with eective string tension proportional simply to q (section 5). the supergravity
description also predicts (2.14) that the gauge coupling constants (gym, ) should have
power-like running in the ir.

4. d3 brane probe in d3+d(-1) background and sym eective action

to support the gauge theory interpretation of the above supergravity background
let us consider the action of a d3-brane probe moving in the d3+d(-1) background and
demonstrate its relation to the quantum eective action of n = 4 sym theory. the latter
will be computed in a constant gauge eld background containing self-dual component on
the stack of n d3-branes representing a source and a constant abelian eld on a separated
d3-brane probe (see, e.g., [44,24,42,43,3,45]). we shall choose the static gauge on the
euclidean d3-brane world volume action. then the action for a d3-brane probe moving
in the background (2.9),(2.2),(2.8) and c1234  u4 takes the form13

12 similar averaged gauge eld congurations were discussed in the context of comparing with
supergravity solutions in, e.g., [42,43]. the idea is to engineer a gauge eld background that
has certain global characteristics (energy, momentum, instanton number, etc.) which are the only
parameters present in the supergravity solution.
13 we use that the d3-brane tension is t3 =
14 the leading interaction term here vanishes in the case of the self-dual fmn which corresponds
to adding d-instanton charge to the d3-brane probe. this is the expected cancellation of the static
potential between the same-type marginal bound states of branes like d3+d(1) and d3+d(1)
or d4 + d0 and d4 + d0 [46,24].

this action can indeed be interpreted as a result of integrating out open string modes con-
necting the probe and the source separated by distance u in at space with fmn background
on the probe and a self-dual background parametrized by q on the source. let us assume
that n coinciding d3-branes carry a constant u (1) self-dual background fmn = fmn, so
that the total u (n + 1) background is block-diagonal, fmn = diag(fmninn , fmni11).
the leading f 4 one-loop correction in the n = 4 sym eective action has the following
structure [47]

1

u4 str(cid:20)( fmn fmn)2  ( fmn f mn)2(cid:21) ,

(4.3)

where f is the total background eld, u is the eective mass scale set by the separation
between branes and str is the symmetrized trace in the adjoint representation. for a
commuting block-diagonal background f = diag(f , f ) we may simply to replace fmn
by fmn  fmn under the adjoint trace adding the overall factor (number of non-zero
eigenvalues) 2n . then the f 4 term in (4.3) vanishes because of the self-duality of f and
the o(f 2f 2) cross-term becomes proportional to15

n
u4 fmnfmn (fmnfmn  fmnf mn) .

(4.4)

assuming that fmnfmn = q/2 as in (3.4) and expanding (4.2) in powers of q we nd the
(precise numerical) agreement between the supergravity (4.2) and the sym (4.4) expres-
sions (see [24] for details of similar calculations).16 a non-trivial feature of this example
is that while q and fmn have very dierent interpretation on the supergravity side (one is
a parameter of the background and another is a coordinate of the probe) they have the
same background gauge eld interpretation on the gauge theory side.

5. string representation for the wilson loop

let us now consider a type iib string propagating in the d3+d(-1) supergravity
background and compute, following [26], the potential between far separated quark and
anti-quark (w-bosons) by evaluating the string partition function representation for the

15 note that the o(f f 3) term n

u4 fmnfmn(fmnfmn  fmnf 

mn) absent in the supergravity
expression vanishes after averaging over the directions of the self-dual eld f , implying < fmn >=
0. as was already mentioned above, this averaging is necessary in order for the brane source gauge
theory state to represent the so(4) invariant supergravity background. the o(f 4) term in (4.3)
is also reproduced by the f 4 term in the expansion of (4.1).

16 from the d-branes in at space perspective the reason why the supergravity (long-distance)
and sym (short-distance) interaction potentials agree [25] is in the non-renormalization theorem
for f 4 terms [48].

wilson factor in the semiclassical approximation. this amounts to computing the value
of the bosonic nambu string action on the classical string conguration. assuming that
the string penetrates the ir (u = 0) region the atness of the string metric in this region
(2.10) implies that the nambu action will be proportional to the area. this implies the
connement behaviour similar to what is found in the non-extremal (nite temperature)
case [49] and in the case of the dilaton-charge deformed 3-brane solution [11].

we shall take the fundamental string action in the form 1

the static gauge x0 = , x1 = , where the world-sheet coordinates  and  run from 0 to
t and l/2 to l/2. as in [26], we shall consider a static string solution which has only
the radial coordinate u changing with . the stationary point is found with the boundary
condition that u runs to innity at l/2 and l/2 and takes the minimal value in between.
since the dilaton and rr eld couplings can be ignored in the semiclassical approximation,
the string action is determined simply by the metric (2.9)

since f 2(u)  h11u4 = 1u4 + q has a minimum at u = 0 it follows from the
general analysis of [50] that the action (5.1) leads to connement with the string tension
proportional to f (0) = q. the same conclusion follows from the light-ray analogy used
in [11] to argue that for a large separation l the potential is dominated by the minimum
of the refraction index n(z), i.e. by the limit z  (/q)1/4.17

indeed, the large l limit is dominated by the ir region u  0 where the string-frame
metric (2.9) becomes at (2.10), so that the string action (5.2) takes the at-space form

an interesting feature is that the eective string tension te does not depend on the

density). this is consistent with the gauge theory picture (section 3) since connement in
a self-dual gauge eld background should be caused simply by the gauge eld condensate.
in the above discussion we have ignored the fact that near the true minimum of n(z),
i.e. z = , u = 0, the string coupling becomes strong and thus string loop corrections
(higher topologies) may not be, in principle, ignored.18 for large l the string probes the
far ir region where the string coupling is no longer small. a way to avoid this problem
may be to impose the ir cuto (2.15) u  u, i.e. to restrict z to values z  z  (/q)1/4.
then the minimal value of n(z) will be at z = z and the potential will contain additional
dependence on l/z. one may qualitatively approximate the resulting eective string
tension as te = 1

 which reduces to (5.5) in the limit u  0.

6. d-string action, s-duality and t hooft loop

additional insight into the structure of the duality is obtained by probing d3+d(-
1) background with a d-string. following [51,52] the exponential of the d-string action
determines (in the semiclassical approximation) the corresponding t hooft loop factor and
thus the potential between magnetic monopoles on the gauge theory side.

in general, a d-string action in a background with a non-trivial metric, dilaton and

rr scalar has the form19

i1 = t1z d2 (cid:2) epdet(gab + fab) + i

2 abcfab (cid:3) .

(6.1)

solving for the 2d gauge eld fab, i.e. integrating it out in the semiclassical approximation
(as, e.g., in [53,54]) gives

i1 = t1z d2 pe2 + c2pdet gab .

(6.2)

the dierence as compared to the fundamental string lagrangian is thus in the tension
factor which in the case of the d-instanton background (2.2),(2.8) becomes (c = ic)

the d-string counterpart of the fundamental string action (5.1) is thus is

(6.4)

remarkably, this action is exactly the same (up to the tension ratio factor 1/gs) as the
fundamental string action (5.1) but with q  q ! since the f-strings and d-strings are
interchanged by s-duality [55,53,54], this suggests that q  q is simply a consequence
of s-duality transformation applied to our background  d-string sees s-dual geometry
(2.9),(2.8),(2.2) with q  q.

indeed, under the basic s-duality transformation   1/ ,  = c + ie, which is a

symmetry of the scalar sl(2, r)/so(2) sigma model action ()2 + e2(c)2 one has

e

= (e2 + c2) e ,

c = (e2 + c2)1c ,

ge = ge .

(6.5)

this target space transformation combined with world-volume duality is a symmetry of
the d3-brane action [54] and relates d-string and f-string actions.
in the case of the
d-instanton or d3+d(-1) backgrounds (2.2),(2.8) one nds from (6.5)20

(6.6)

with the (unchanged) einstein-frame metric again given by ads5  s5. thus indeed the
basic s-duality transformation corresponds to changing the sign of q (and inverting the
string coupling). the selfduality of d3-brane action suggests that switching of the sign of
q should be induced by the duality transformation on the sym side.

the s-dual string-frame metric is proportional to (2.9) with q  q,

(6.7)

20 we stress that this s-duality is the standard transformation of the minkowski type iib
supergravity with c formally replaced by ic in the case of the d-instanton background. this

transformation is dierent from the one considered in the rst reference in [18], where s-duality
was interpreted as a symmetry of the rotated action ()2  e2(c)2. the basic sl(2, r)
transformation there was s  1/s, s = c  e, while (6.5) corresponds in this notation
to s  1/s. both transformations are formally the symmetries of the scalar sl(2, r)/so(1, 1)
action  s+s
(s+s)2 (see also [56]), but it is (6.5) that is the standard sl(2, z) symmetry that has a
d-brane interpretation. more general sl(2, z) transformations (6.5) do not admit a continuation

to the case of imaginary c which preserves reality of the dilaton. note that under the euclidean
transformation s  1/s one nds that e
u4  1, i.e. that the dilaton is dened
in the dual region u < u but it again blows up at u = 0.

= e  2 = q

12

with u = u = (q)1/4 being a curvature singularity. the dual eective string coupling
in (6.6) remains small for all values of u > u and vanishes at u = u. thus under s-
duality the singularity of the original background in the dilaton (2.2),(2.8) (at u = 0) gets
transformed into the singularity in the metric (at u = u).

the potential between monopole m and anti-monopole m can be found by minimizing
the d-string action (6.4). as in the case considered in [51,52], there exists a critical distance

lcrit  (


q

)1/4 ,

(6.8)

such that for l < lcrit, there is minimal d-string world sheet connecting m and m. for
l  lcrit we are eectively in the ads5  s5 region and the potential is proportional
to 1/l as in the case of the conformal n = 4 sym theory. for l > lcrit there is no
the potential becomes constant  the
string solution u() which minimizes (6.4), i.e.
magnetic monopoles are screened. since the d-string action (6.4) may be interpreted
as an action of the fundamental string propagating in the s-dual background (6.7), the
screening behavior of the m m potential may be understood also from the fact that around
the horizon(singularity) u = u in (6.7) the string world sheet is contractable and can
split into two separate parts.

the resulting picture is consistent with the discussion in section 5:

in the region
q )1/4 the electric charges (w-bosons) are conned, while the magnetic monopoles

l  ( 
are screened.

7. concluding remarks

our motivation in discussing the above d3-brane + d-instanton background is that
it provides a simple generalization of the gravity  gauge theory correspondence in the
pure d3-brane case. we have seen that the supergravity or string theory description
predicts a (coupling-independent) connement behaviour, essentially because the constant
d-instanton density makes the string-frame metric at in the ir region. this connement
does not apply to all states, and there are still some gapless excitations in this background
(in particular, one linear combination of the dilaton and rr scalar uctuations satises
the massless laplace equation in ads5  s5, see appendix).

this example is dierent from the case of localized d-instantons in ads5  s5 which
correspond to localized ym instantons in the boundary gauge theory [19,21] and are vir-
tual euclidean congurations contributing to path integral and producing non-perturbative
contributions to observables on both sides of the duality correspondence. adding a lo-
calized instanton is a perturbation of the pure d3-brane case, while we interpreted the
homogeneous self-dual gauge eld background as a special n = 2 supersymmetric state of
the n = 4 sym theory.

13

though this euclidean self-dual background is somewhat articial from physical point
of view, it would be interesting to understand the reason for a power-like ir ow of the
gauge coupling (2.14) from the gauge theory point of view.

the conformal invariance of the n = 4 sym theory is broken by the background
eld density parameter q in a soft way. since the einstein frame metric remains that
of the ads5  s5 space, some of the supergravity modes which do not directly couple to
the dilaton (like the s5-radius mode) do not feel the presence of q, i.e. still satisfy the
same massive ads5 laplace equations as in the pure d3-brane case. the correlators of
the corresponding gauge eld operators (f 4 + ... in the s5 radius case) are thus expected
to be the same as in the vacuum n = 4 sym case. at the same time, the dilaton and rr
scalar modes which satised the massless laplace equation in the pure d3-brane case no
longer do so in the d3+d(-1) background (the correlators of f 2 and f f  operators are
certainly dierent from the vacuum case). since the scalar eld background values are non-
constant, their uctuations mix with each other and also with graviton perturbations. the
corresponding quadratic uctuation action is derived in appendix below. such mixing is a
general feature of solutions with non-constant dilaton backgrounds, like d4-brane [57,58]
or the solution of [10,11,12].

appendix a. perturbations of the supergravity background

below we shall study small uctuations of the metric, dilaton and rr scalar elds near
the background (2.2),(2.8),(2.9). the equations for the dilaton and rr scalar perturbations
are in general of interest in connection with spectrum of possible bound states on gauge
theory side [7,58,57]. the scalar perturbations are not, in general, expected to decouple
from the metric perturbations in the case of non-constant scalar background as we illustrate
below on the present d3+d(-1) example.

we start with the d = 5 einstein-frame lagrangian for the metric-dilaton-axion

system (c = ic; ,  = 1, ..., 10)

l =pg(cid:2) r 

1
2

and expand the elds near their background values

g (    e2  c c)(cid:3) ,

(a.1)

 =  +  ,

c = c + e ,

g = g + h .

(a.2)

the background elds  and c satisfy

c = e ,

ed2e = d2 + ()2 = 0 ,

(a.3)

where d is the covariant derivative depending on the background metric g . the
einstein-frame metric in (2.9) is that of the ads5  s5 space.

expanding to the second order in uctuation elds we get for the  and  dependent

part of l (we omit the pure graviton h2 part)

l2 = g(cid:20)h [(+)  (+)]()2+2()22+()2+4 (cid:21) , (a.4)

where

h  h 

1

gh,

h = gh .

following [59] we choose the dieomorphism gauge xing term to be

lg.f. =

= g(cid:20)

gdh

dh

()2( + )2(cid:21) .

(a.5)

the ,  dependent part of the gauge-xed lagragian is then (we again omit o(h2) terms)

l2 = l2 + lg.f. = g(cid:20) (  + dd ) h ( + )

15

+ ()2  2()22  ()2  4  +

()2 ( + )2(cid:21) .

(a.6)

note that because of the classical equation for  (a.3) the trace of h does not actually
couple to  and .

using the explicit form of the background einstein-frame metric and the dilaton (see

(2.2),(2.8),(2.9))

ds2

e =

1
z2 (dxmdxm + dz2 + z2d5) ,

e = 1 +

qz4


,

(a.7)

we get for the coupling function in the graviton  ( + ) mixing term

  + dd  = zz[2

z  + z1z + (z)2]  z1mnz .

(a.8)

this function is non-vanishing, so there is a non-trivial mixing between  +  and the
traceless part of h .

introducing

we may rewrite (a.6) as

 =    ,

1
2

()22

+2+  + ( +dd ) h +(cid:21) . (a.9)

l2 = g(cid:20)+
then the equations of motion for  and + are
d2+  2+  2d2 + = 0 ,
d2 + 2 + ()2+ + (  + dd )h = 0 .

(a.10)

(a.11)

using (a.3) the equation for + can be written also as

d2(e+) = 0 ,

i.e. the eld e+ satises the massless scalar equation in the ads5  s5 space.

since the elds  and c couple to the boundary gauge theory operators as

lint(, c) = etr(fmnfmn)  ctr(fmnf mn) ,

(a.12)

their perturbations couple as

lint( + ,c + e) = lint(, c)  e(cid:2)  tr(fmnfmn) +  tr(fmnf mn)(cid:3) + ...
= lint(, c)  e+ tr(f (+)

mn )  e tr(f ()

mn ) + ... ,

mn f ()

mn f (+)

(a.13)

16

where

f ()
mn

(fmn  f mn) .

in interpreting this expression we should take into account that + and  are conjugate
to each other like light-cone variables (cf. the kinetic term in (a.9)). thus the term that
couples to + is actually the source for  and vice versa.
in view of (a.11) we then
conclude that the operator tr(f ()
mn ) is still counterpart of a massless mode in the
ads5 space. this is perfectly consistent with the fact that the background gauge eld
corresponding to the supergravity solution satises (3.1), < tr(f ()
mn ) >= 0, i.e. does
not have a condensate.

the second eld  is non-trivially coupled to the graviton and thus has more compli-
