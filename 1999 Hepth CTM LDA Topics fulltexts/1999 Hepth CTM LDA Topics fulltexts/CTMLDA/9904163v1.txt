abstract

we present the explicit global realization of the isometries of anti-de sitter like
spaces of signature (d, d+), and their algebras in the space of functions on the
pseudo-riemannian symmetric space so(d + 1, d+)/so(d, d+). the process of
going to the invariant boundaries leads to the realization of the corresponding con-
formal groups and algebras. we compute systematically the geodesics in these
spaces by considering the coset representation of them.

1 introduction

anti de sitter spaces (ads) were left aside initially in general relativity in detriment
of de sitter (ds) spaces due to the (dubious) interpretation of the negative cosmological
constant that supports them. a posteriori were relived in the context of supergravity
as possible vacuum solutions in compactication mechanisms [1] and the study of black
hole thermodynamics on them [2]. emphasis was certainly put in (1, 3) signatures and
euclidean versions in the quantum gravity context.

however during the past year a huge amount of work rounding ads spaces in dierent
dimensions was made in relation with maldacenas conjectures relating on-shell quantum
gravity theories on adsp+1 with o-shell conformal eld theories (cft) that live on
its p dimensional boundary [3]. the reason behind this relation can be heuristically
found in the fact [3], [4] that any theory of gravity with a vacuum value of the metric
tensor given by d + 1-dimensional ads space, having in mind the existence of a time-like
boundary, should depend on boundary conditions dened on the d dimensional boundary

1this work was partially supported by conicet, argentina.

manifold and should realize the isometry group of this space that becomes automatically
the conformal group acting on the boundary. so it seems natural that the degrees of
freedom living on the boundary should realize this symmetry. of course things are not
so easy, the growing number of people working on the eld extended in many directions
a representation of this fact, neither obvious [5].

it is the aim of this paper to clarify several aspects of this relation from the purely
mathematical point of view, particularly the group actions on this spaces and their relation
with the corresponding ones on the boundaries, and to study geodesics on them, all in
the general case of (d, d+) arbitrary signature (since now on adsd,d+), generalizing in
some cases results known in cases of earlier physical interest [7].

2 review of adsd,d+ spaces

several denitions of adsd,d+ spaces are possible (in section 5 we will introduce another
dierent to that given here useful for our purposes there) and many parametrizations of
them were introduced in the literature, each one useful in particular contexts. for sake
of completeness and later use we believe pertinent to give a brief summary of them.

2.1 the dening coordinates
let us consider cartesian coordinates {wm , m = d, . . . , 0, . . . , d+} in 1+d+d+ with
d  0, and endows it with the minkowskian metric

d+1,d+ = m n dwm dwn ,     1d+1

0

0

1d+ !

(2.1)

this is a maximally symmetric space (mss) with the pseudo-poincar`e isometry group
iso(d + 1, d+). the adsd,d+ space is introduced as the submanifold dened by the
constraint

m n wm wn = r0

2 , r0 > 0

(2.2)

where r0 is the radius (curvature scale) of the space, with the metric g induced by (2.1).
clearly the constraint respects only so(d + 1, d+) invariance and then it becomes the
isometry group of adsd,d+; reduction of the dimensionality combines with the reduction
of symmetry to make it also a mss. as such its curvature tensor veries 2

the metric takes the form

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

in the euclidean case d = 0 the topology corresponds to a two-sheeted hyperboloid with
basis in w0 = r0; we will consider the connected component given by the + sign in
(2.4), the sheet based on w0 = +r0 with naive topology d+.
if instead d+ = 0 the
topology is compact corresponding to a sd of radius r0 and wrong sign metric. in the
general case d > 0 the topology is sd  d+ corresponding to a hyperboloid, the (non)
compact directions being (space) time like. it is important to note that the solution of
(2.4) imposes the condition

w w + r0

in terms of them the metric takes the simple diagonal form where the signature is manifest,

2.3 the global coordinates

given the constraint (2.2) it is natural to introduce in our context hyperbolic coordinates
covering the sector of wm wm < 0 of md+1,d+ space as follows,

  wd

~w

! = r cosh rl n

~w+ = r sinh rl n+

(2.13)

n = 1, so n, n+ dene points in sd, sd+1 respectively (the
where r > 0, rl  0, and nt
case d+ = 0 is handled by putting rl  0)). obviously in this coordinates the constraint
(2.2) is equivalent to x r = r0; the metric is written as

g = r0

2 (cid:16) cosh2 rl d2d + d2rl + sinh2 rl d2d+1(cid:17)

(2.14)

where d2p stands for the standard measure of (radius 1) sp. the signature as well as
the topology is manifest in this form, with n and (rl, n+) parametrizing sd and d+
respectively. the  +  (  ) sign in (2.4) corresponds to consider the semi-sphere of
sd containing the north (south) pole.

it is common in general relativity contexts [2] to introduce the radial variable

rh = sinh rl , rh  0
g = r0

2  (1 + rh

2) d2d +

d2rh
1 + rh

2 + rh

2 d2d+1!

(2.15)

where the near horizon geometry rh  0 is manifestly minkowskian.

another variant is to introduce

rh = tan  , 0   <
g = r0


2

2 sec2  (cid:16)d2d + d2 + sin2  d2d+1(cid:17)

(2.16)

which shows that adsd,d+ is conformal to the geometry product of a time-like sd and
a trumpet, the well known (for (1, 3) signature) einstein static universe (for exactness,
one half of it [7]).

2.4 the poincar`e coordinates
in md+1,d+ are introduced in terms of (wm ) the following coordinates (d+ > 0)

x = r0 (wd + wd+)1 w
x+ = r0
v = r0

2 (wd + wd+)1
2 (wd  wd+)




 


wd = r0

w = r0 (x+)1 x

where  = d + 1, . . . , 0, . . . , d+  1 . the constraint (2.2) looks

and solving for v the metric reads in poincar`e parametrization (x+  xd+)

g =

2

r0
(x+)2  dx dx

(2.19)

these coordinates were considered in [4] to do computations in the boundary theory; the
reason of this fact should be clear in section 3.

a little modication of this system of coordinates, namely

u = (x+)1

g = r0

2   d2u

u 2 + u 2  dx dx!

(2.20)

was introduced in [3] where it appears in a natural way coming from the usual parametriza-
tion of p-brane geometries in the decoupling limit.

2.5 the boundary of adsd,d+ spaces

for d+ > 0 we saw that adsd,d+ is a non compact space.
it is possible however to
adscribe to it a boundary through penroses concept of conformal innity. the rough
idea (see [7] for exact statements) consists in trying to map the space-time at hand to
a (possible nite) region in which null curves are at /4, and in such a way that both
geometries are weyl-related. then causality concepts will coincide in both spaces and we
should be able to identify the conformal boundaries where any curve should born and die.
in our case we have the job made by considering the form (2.16) of the metric; from
there it follows that the boundary corresponds to the hypersurface dened by  = /2,
topologically homeomorphic to sd  sd+1. 3 it is time-like in character; when d = 1
this fact is responsable among other things for the lack of global hyperbolicity (if d > 1
clearly the concept of a cauchy surface is not obvious).

note also that this denition is the same as to consider the rl =  limiting surface,
the same way in spirit in which the boundary was introduced in [4]. in plane coordinates
it corresponds to the hypersurface

z z = r2
0

(2.21)
in poincar`e coordinates it is sitted at x+ = 0 (u = ); however some points at innity
should be added to the space parametrized by (x) to get the conformal compactication
of md,d+1, i.e. sd  sd+1. of course this fact a bit obscure in this coordinatization
follows from the relations (2.17) and becomes evident from the action of so(d + 1, d+)
on the boundary given in the next section.

3 the so(d + 1, d+) action

the action of the isometry group on adsd,d+ is that induced by the linear action on
md+1,d+. let d+1,d+  so(d + 1, d+); it admits a coset decomposition under its

3 when d+ = 1 the boundary consists of two disconnected s d

 ( s 0  z2).

(3.2)

by restricting ourselves to the submanifold (2.2) and using (2.4) we get the non linear
realization searched for. this is easier acomplished in the global coordinates (rl, n, n+)
of (2.13); in terms of them the transformations are given by

2 p n + sinh rl s q n+
2 p n + sinh rl s q n+|
2 q n+
2 q n+|

(3.3)

from here it is clear that the boundary results invariant under the so(d + 1, d+) trans-
formations; in fact rl =  is mapped to rl =  while the variables in the boundary
manifold realize the isometry in the way

(3.4)

these expressions provide a global, non linear realization of generalized conformal trans-
formations. this realization is made not on md,d+1 but on the conformal compacti-
cation of it, i.e. sd  sd+1. for example in the euclidean case d = 0 there is no n
and the boundary sd+1 is parametrized by n+  ~n; with st  ~s we have

~n =

q ~n +(cid:16)(1 + |~s|2)

(3.5)

the (linear) transformations ~s = ~0 with q  so(d+) are just the isometries of sd+1 and
those with q = 1 corresponds to scale and special conformal transformations parametrized
by ~s  d+; both generate the conformal group so(1, d+). but although compact and
clear in meaning they are not enough useful for most current applications. for this we
move to get the realization in poincar`e coordinates.

from (2.17) it should be clear that the parametrization (3.1) is not a convenient one.
instead we will proceed in two steps. first we decompose so(d+1, d+) under so(d, d+)

d+1,d+(~s, qdd+) = kd+1,d+(~s) h(1, qd,d+)

~st dd+

wd  w, and vectors,  matrices, etc., will be (d + d+  1)-dimensional; scalar
in this spirit we
products of vectors will be wrt d,d+1  , i.e. ~v1  ~v2  ~v1

(3.7)

with this in mind the second step is to decompose qd,d+ under so(d, d+  1) in a
similar fashion

qd,d+(~s2, q) = kd,d+(~s2) h(q, 1)

kd,d+(~s2) =   1  ~s2 ~st

of so(d + 1, d+) dierent from (3.1) in terms of a so(d, d+  1) matrix q, two real
(d + d+  1)-dimensional vectors ~s1, ~s2 and a real number .
as in (3.2) is straightforward to get the linear transformations of the (w, ~w, w+)-
coordinates. with them and (2.17), (2.18) we nally obtain

these are the expressions we liked to nd. they realize non linearly the group of isometries
so(d + 1, d+) on the whole adsd,d+ space, and act on the invariant boundary x+ = 0
(modulo compactications) in the usual way. more explicitly, it is not dicult to show
that the standard conformal transformations are given by

4 the adsd,d+ and conformal algebras

here we consider the representation of the corresponding algebras and their meaning in
each context.

the so(d + 1, d+) lie algebra is (xm n = xn m )

[xm n , xp q] = n p xm q + m q xn p  (m  n)

(4.1)

an arbitrary element  in the vector representation obeys: t  +   = 0 , and then
 = 1

2m n vm n , where the generators in this representation are

(em

vm n  v (xm n ) = em n  en m
n )p

m n

q

q  p

(4.2)

the innitesimal generators acting on functions in md+1,d+ are introduced in the stan-
dard way in order to obey (4.1)

wm  p q xp qwm
xm n = wm n  wn m

8

(4.3)

then the realization of the generators on adsd,d+ in (w) coordinates are gotten by
taking into account the constraint (2.2)

x = w   w 
2)
p =  (ww + r0

2  = x|ads

and obeys the adsd,d+ algebra

[ x, x] =  x +  x  (  )
[p, x] =  p   p
[p, p] = x

(4.4)

(4.5)

now let us see the realization in poincar`e coordinates. from (3.9) the innitesimal trans-
formations are

~x = p ~x + ~a   ~x + ~b (~x2 + (x+)2)  2 ~b  ~x ~x
x+ = ( + 2 ~b  ~x ) x+

where in view of (3.10), (3.11), (3.12) we have introduced

p = q

~a =
2
 = 
1
~b =
2r0

(~s1 + ~s2)

(~s1  ~s2)

(4.6)

(4.7)

and according to the denition in the rst line of (4.3) we get the innitesimal generators
associated to (p, ~a, , ~b) respectively as (   

x )

1
r0

j = x   x  = x
(p + x+)
p =  =
d = x  + x+ + = p+
k = (cid:16)(~x2 + (x+)2) 

 + 2 x x(cid:17)  + 2 x x+ + = r0 (p  x+)

these operators obeys the so(d + 1, d+) algebra in the form

[j, j] =  j +  j  (  )
[ p, j] =  p   p
[ k, j] =  k   k
[ p, d] = p
[ k, d] =  k
[ k, p] = 2 ( d + j)

0 = [ p, p] = [ k, k] = [ d, j]

9

(4.8)

(4.9)

which is the standard form of the conformal algebra. in conclusion, the standard so(d +
1, d+) linear realization leads to the usual representation of their innitesimal generators
(4.3) in the space of functions on md+1,d+; the non-linear realization instead yields the
representation (4.5) of them in the space of functions on adsd,d+, which in turns take
the form (4.8) in poincar`e coordinates where the conformal algebra point of view is clear,
in particular at the boundary x+ = 0.

5 coset representation and geodesics

adsd,d+ spaces can be dened as pseudo-riemannian homogeneous symmetric spaces,
i.e. a coset space g/h; more precisely: adsd,d+  so(d + 1, d+)/so(d, d+) . this
can be seen directly from the coset decomposition introduced in (3.6); let us rewrite the
coset element in the form

0 ! = 


~st 

c
~s 1 +

~s ~st 
1+c

k(~s) = exp  0 ~ut

~u
sinh~u2

~u2

~s =
~u
1 = c 2 + ~s2

from here and (2.2) we can identify our dening coordinates as

w  r0 c
w  r0 s




(5.1)

(5.2)

furthermore it is possible to show [8] that the metric induced on it by the invariant metric
on so(d + 1, d+) is given by (2.6).

there exists an elegant method in this context to get the geodesics wrt this metric [8].
it consists simply in lifting up to the coset element the geodesics through the null element
in the lie algebra wrt the cartan-killing metric on it. in this way we obtain a geodesic
through the identity in the coset space that we identify with the point (w = r0, ~w = ~0)
in adsd,d+. 4 in order to get a geodesic through an arbitrary point we have to act by
left action with an element of the coset. let us show how all this works here.

first of all let us consider geodesics through the origin of adsd,d+. they are given

by (5.1) with ~u replaced by

~u( ) = ~u 

(5.3)

where the velocity ~u parametrizes the family. this is so because (5.3) are the geodesics
through the null element in the lie algebra. therefore according to (5.1), (5.2) the

4 more exactly, this is so if d = 0 according to the choice of connected component discussed in
section 2.1. if d > 0 we have two sets of geodesics if they are not time-like, one covering the region
w > 0 corresponding to take w = +r0 as the origin, and one covering the region w < 0 if starting
through w = r0. if they are time-like instead, there is just one family that rolls up the time direction,
see below.

10

geodesics in adsd,d+ through the origin will be given in (w)-coordinates by

w( ) = r0 


sinh  u , u2 = +1 , space  like
sin  u , u2 = 1 , time  like
 u

, ~u2 = 0

, null

(5.4)

where  = q|~u2| , u = ~u/. for sake of interpretation is useful to have them in global

coordinates (rl, n+, n). if ~u = (~u, ~u+) and we reintroduce the vector

~w+  r0 sinh rl n+  d+

parametrizing the space-like sections of adsd,d+, then

space-like geodesics: with u+

2 = 1 + u

~w+( ) = r0 u+ sinh

(5.8)

from these explicit expressions it is easy for example to compute for a non-null geodesic
the distance between the origin and a point at  ; it is simply:
s( ) =  r0  . null
geodesics reach the time-like boundary asymptotically in a conserved spatial direction
instead time-like geodesics are bounded and periodic with period t = 2

they never reach the boundary. 5

we complete the analysis given the expression of the geodesics through an arbitrary

point. from the stated at the beginning of this section we need to get the map

to the starting point.
geodesics converge to an image point and diverge from it to re-converge to another one and so on.

dened by the left action of an element in the coset in the form

k(~s0) k(~s)  k(~s0 ~s) h(1, q)

, q  so(d, d+)

then having obtained the map ~s0 ~s a geodesic through ~s0 is just

~s( ; ~s0, ~u) = ~s0~s( )

(5.10)

(5.11)

where ~s( ) is a geodesic passing through the origin. after a little bit of algebra we get
the map in the simple form




c( ; ~s0, ~u)

~s( ; ~s0, ~u) 

 = k(~s0)   c( )
~s( ) !

(5.12)

from here, the identications (5.2) and the results (5.6), (5.7), (5.8) we have the explicit
whole set of geodesics in adsd,d+ spaces.

6 conclusions

first of all it is worth to say that we have concentrated along the paper on adsd,d+
spaces, but it should be clear that dsd,d+ ones are straigthforwardly studied in our
metric signature convention starting from (2.2) with a  +  sign on its r.h.s. and working
on md,d++1 . in particular the coset representation for them is given by so(d, d+ +
1)/so(d, d+).
we obtained explicit global non linear realizations of the isometry groups, equations
(3.3), (3.9), by using various coset decompositions where the parameter space of the trans-
formations is manifest at dierence what happens by considering innitesimal transforma-
tions. from these realizations issues like the conformal compactication of the boundary
as well as the relation between standard generators of orthogonal, ads and conformal
algebras are evident.

finally it is none to say that geodesics in spaces of physical interest are well-known, 6
in particular ads1,3. we believed useful and instructive however to extend these results
to arbitrary adsd,d+ spaces giving the explicit expressions obtained through the coset
space method without any reference to the metric.

we think our results can be of usefulness among other things in the non trivial problem
of xing boundary conditions in the search of solutions of gravity-matter classical eld
theories in the presence of a non zero cosmological constant [9].
