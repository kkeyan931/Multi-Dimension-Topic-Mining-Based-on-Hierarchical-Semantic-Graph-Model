abstract

we study the time evolution of congurations in the form of two parallel domain walls
moving towards each other in a supersymmetric eld model. the congurations involved are not
bps-saturated. it is found that for such collisions there exists some critical value vcr  0.9120
of the initial velocity vi of the walls. at vi < vcr we observed reection, that was not followed
by change of vacuum states sequence.
in collisions with vi > vcr the sequence of vacuum
states changes. the results of the numerical simulations are in agreement with potential
consideration.

the dynamic properties of domain walls in supersymmetric theories have attracted some
attention recently [1] - [6]. depending on particular form of the superpotential being chosen,
one obtains dierent sets of supersymmetric vacua and dierent structure of domain wall con-
gurations interpolating between them. we restrict ourselves by consideration of the theory
described by the superpotential

w (, x) =

m2

3  x 2 ,

(1)

where m is a mass parameter and  and  are coupling constants. we assume that  and  are
real and positive. the lagrangian for the real parts of the scalar elds is given for this theory
by the expression

l = ()2 + ()2  m2

  2  2!2

 4222 .

(2)

the potential term of eq. (2) has four degenerate vacuum states, shown in fig. 1. this
theory possess a wide class of domain walls, which link dierent vacua. some of them satisfy
rst order dierential equations analogous to the bogomolnyi-prasad-sommerfeld (bps) equa-
tions [7]. the dynamic properties of the bps congurations for this model were intensively
studied recently [1] - [6]. this our work is devoted to the so-called non-bps domain walls, i.e.
congurations which link dierent vacua of the theory, but do not satisfy bps equations.

it is convenient to work with dimensionless eld variables f and h, dened as

 =

m


f ,  =

m


h .

the lagrangian (2) yields the following equations of motion for elds f and h:

tt  2f  2f (1  f 2  h2) +
f 2

f h2 = 0 ,

here  = /, m = 1.
it was shown (see, e.g., ref. [5]) that for the case  = 4 the eld
equations (3) possess an elementary walls, connecting vacua 3 and 2, 2 and 4. their form
may be obtained analytically [5]:

h(1  f 2  h2) +

here z is a space coordinate orthogonal to the walls. it is easy to see, that the rest energy of
these 3  2 and 2  4 walls equals e0 = 4/3.

consider a non-bps ansatz conguration 3  2  4 constructed from two elementary
domain walls 3  2 and 2  4 located at z = z0 and z = +z0 respectively. let us take their
simple superposition in the form

f324(z, z0) = f32(z + z0) + f24(z  z0)  1 ,
h324(z, z0) = h32(z + z0) + h24(z  z0) .

(6)

note, that from the system (3) the special diagonal solution 3  4 can be easily found by
substituting f = 0:

.

(7)

the energy of such conguration is e34 = 16/3.

f34(z)  0, h34(z) =  tanh

to get z0-dependence of the energy of conguration (6) we have to insert (6) into hamilto-

nian of the model. as a result we obtain

here f32 = f32(z + z0), h32 = h32(z + z0), f24 = f24(z  z0), h24 = h24(z  z0). we calculated
the z0-dependence of e324 numerically, see fig. 2 (solid curve). at the limit of large z0 the
conguration (6) looks like two isolated walls 3  2 and 2  4. therefore their total energy
equals 2e0, and e324  0. as it is seen from fig. 2, energy e324 increases with decreasing
z0. at z0 = 0 e324(0)  3.119. it corresponds to e324(0) = 2e0 + e324(0)  5.786. note,
that e324(0) is larger than e34 = 16/3  5.333. the energy of conguration 3  2  4 (6) has
its absolute maximum at z0  0.37 when (e324)max  3.202. at large negative z0 e324(z0)
has asymptotic value about 2.274. in the range z0 < 0 conguration (6) actually has the shape
of the 3  1  4 type, see fig. 3.

it is clear, that we can construct an ansatz conguration 3  1  4 in analogy to (6):

f314(z, z0) = f31(z + z0) + f14(z  z0) + 1 ,
h314(z, z0) = h31(z + z0) + h14(z  z0) ,

where

f31(z) = 

1

2 (cid:18)1 + tanh

z

2(cid:19) , h31(z) = s 1

2 (cid:18)1  tanh

f14(z) =

2 (cid:18)1  tanh

z

2(cid:19) , h14(z) = s 1

2 (cid:18)1 + tanh

z

2(cid:19) .

(12)

the energy of 3  1 and 1  4 walls is exactly the same as of 3  2 or 2  4. hence, the
z0-dependence of the energy of conguration (10) will be

e314(z0) = 2e0 + e314(z0) ,

(13)

with potential e314(z0) analogous to e324(z0), eq. (9). the shape of e314(z0) is the
same as of e324(z0). as it was already mentioned, at z0 < 0 ansatz (6) has the shape
of 3  1  4 type indeed. obviously, conguration (10) at negative z0 has the shape of
3  2  4 type, see fig. 3. notice, that h324(z, z0) 6= h314(z, z0). if we would like to compare
energies of congurations (6) or (10) that belong to one of these two types, we have to place
curves e324(z0) and e314(z0) (or curves e314(z0) and e324(z0)) in the same plot.
fig. 2 is constructed just in this way.

cr

we solved eld equations (3) numerically with initial conditions in the form of (6), where
3  2 and 2  4 walls located at some initial distance 2z0  1 and are moving towards each
other with some initial velocity vi. depending on the initial velocity we observed dierent types
of evolution. if vi is less than some critical value vnum
, walls 3  2 and 2  4 collide and then
escape from each other to innity. as a result we return to the conguration of the 3  2  4
type. at initial velocities vi > vnum
the walls collide in a dierent way. the point is that after
collision the conguration of the type 3  1  4 appears. from these numerical simulations
we found vnum
cr  0.9120. the presence of dierent regimes in such collisions is a consequence
of the fact that the energy of conguration 3  2  4 is not degenerate with respect to the
parameter z0. so, we have a kind of potential interaction between 3  2 and 2  4 domain
walls. it is worth to mention here, that in the case of bps-saturated (or simply bps) walls [6]
there is no potential interaction. the latter property is a consequence of the degeneracy in
energies of congurations with dierent interwall distances, analogous to our parameter z0.

cr

existence of the critical velocity can be understood in terms of the potential approach.
from fig. 2 it is seen, that if the initial kinetic energy of the walls 3  2 and 2  4 is smaller
than e   3.119, then (inelastic) reection may be expected. if the kinetic energy of the
walls exceeds e , it is natural to expect that congurations of the type (6) with negative z0
appear. but conguration (6) at negative z0 is of the type 3  1  4 indeed, and from fig. 2
we see, that in this sector congurations (10) have smaller energy. hence, conguration (6) at
negative z0 transforms into (10). in further evolution the walls 3  1 and 1  4 escape to
innity.

it is also worth mentioning, that the initial conguration (6) with z0 = 0 and vi = 0 looks
like some excitation over the static solution (7). after emission of part of energy in the form
of waves, the evolution of this initial conguration (z0 = 0, vi = 0) leads to formation of an
excited kink of type (7) (wobbling kink). we were unable to get this wobbling kink solution

either z0 or vi was not equal to zero.
