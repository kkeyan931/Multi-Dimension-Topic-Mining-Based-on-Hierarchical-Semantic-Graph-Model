conformally invariant sigma models in d = 2n dimensions with target non-compact

o(2n, 1) groups are studied.

o(2n, 1) groups, the classical action and hamiltonian are positive denite.
eld congurations are found to correspond geometrically to conformal stereographic
mappings of r2n into the euclidean signature ads2n spaces. zaikovs relationship between
self dual p-branes and chern-simons p-branes, provided p = p + 1 and the embedding
d = p + 1-dimensional manifold has euclidean signature, is elaborated further. chern-
simons p-branes moving on euclidean signature ads2n backgrounds, with p+2 = 2n, have
no local bulk dynamics but global degrees of freedom conned to the boundary of anti de
sitter space. since chern-simons p-branes have an underlying innite dimensional algebra
containing w1+ , as shown by zaikov, we discuss the importance that w geometry should
have in the nal formulation of m theory.

i. introduction

conformally invariant o(2n+1)  models in 2n dimensions were of crucial importance
in the construction of conformally invariant lagrangians, with vanishing world-volume
cosmological constant, for bosonic p-branes ( p + 1 = 2n ) [1,2]. in particular, self dual
unit charge instanton solutions were found which correspond to conformal ( stereographic)
maps from r2n  s2n. these models [1] were the higher-dimensional extension of the
o(5)  models of feisager and leinaas in 4d [3]. when p + 1 = odd, the authors [2] also
built lagrangians for bosonic extendons ( branes) , however, conformal invariance was
lost. these sort of lagrangians allowed the author to construct a polynomial action for
the spinning membrane after a weyl covariantization process was performed [4]. another
weyl invariant spinning membrane action was constructd by [5] but it was nonpolynomial
complicating the quantization program.
conformal field theories have risen to more prominence recently mainly due to mal-
dacenas conjecture on the ads/cft duality between m/string theory on adsd  sdd
backgrounds and cfts living on the projective boundary of the adsd spaces [6]. rele-
vant  models with target spaces on certain supergroups have been used to decribe cf t
on ads backgrounds with ramond-ramond (rr) flux [7]. in particular, various exact
2d cf t on ads2n+1 backgrounds have been constructed recently that could be used in
building superstring theories propagating on ads2n+1 backgrounds [8]. these  models

1

were based on the standard sl(2, r) wznw model; i.e  models on group manifolds with
wznw terms.

conventional -models are based on compact groups like o(2n), su (n)....

in gen-
eral, compact simple groups are used mainly to simplify the quantization program; i.e the
quantization is not riddled with the standard problems of ghosts due to the non-positive
denite inner products; uniqueness of the wz functional; solvability of the model; positiv-
ity of the hamiltonian [29,30]. the authors [29] studied o(n, 1), su (n, 1) non-compact
sigma models in two-dimensions and have shown that a dynamical mass generation with
asymptotic freedom is possible and that a sensible unitary quantization program is possible
by recurring to a selection rule in the hilbert space of states ( only postive denite norms
are allowed).

setting aside these technical subtleties on the compact simple character of the group,
and motivated by the recent ndings on anti de sitter spaces, we will study conformally
invariant ( noncompact ) o(2n1, 2) -models in 2n even dimensions; i.e maps from r2n to
o(2n 1, 2) and o(2n, 1). instanton solutions are found for the latter case, corresponding
to conformal, stereographic  maps from r2n to o(2n, 1). the so(2n, 1) group manifold
is topologically the euclidean signature ads2n whose natural isometry group is so(2n, 1).
to be more specic, we shall concentrate on o(2n  1, 2) and o(2n, 1) -models keeping
in mind that the relevant groups are the so(2n  1, 2) and so(2n, 1).
the lorentz signature ads2n space can be viewed as a hyperboloid embedded in a
pseudo-euclidean 2n + 1-dim manifold with coordinates ya = y0, y1, ..., y2n and diagonal
metric given by ab = diag (, +, +, .., +, ) with length squared yaya preserved by the
isometry group so(2n  1, 2). the ads2n is dened as the geometrical locus :

yaybab = r2 = 1.
de sitter spaces require a change in the sign in the r.h.s.

(1)

signature subtleties are crucial in the construction of instanton solutions. the ordi-
nary hodge dual star operation is signature dependent. for example, the double hodge
dual star operation acting on a rank p dierential form in a 4d space satises :

f = s(1)p(4p)f. s = +1 f or (4, 0); (2, 2). s = 1 f or (3, 1); (1, 3)

(2)

where we have displayed the explicit signature dependence in the values of s. hence, for a
rank two form f , in euclidean 4d space and with signature (2, 2) ( atiyah-ward spaces)
one can nd solutions to the (anti) self dual ym equations : f = f . there are no
ym instantons in 4d minkowski space since in the latter one has imaginary eigenvalues :
f = if .
the two temporal variables are required in the embedding process of ads2n into the
pseudo-euclidean space r2n1,2 we will show, in fact, that it is the noncompact o(2n, 1) -
model, instead of the o(2n 1, 2) -model , that has instanton solutions obeying a double
self duality condition similar to the one obeyed by the bpst instanton [9]. it was shown [1]
that , the euclidean ( compact) o(2n + 1)  model instanton solutions are directly related
to instanton solutions of o(2n) generalized ym (gym) theories in r2n [10] obeying the
forementioned double self duality condition.

2

in view of the conformally invariant  models/gym connection in higher dimensions,
the next step is to study p-branes ( with p + 1 = 2n ) propagating on adsd backgrounds.
in particular, the critical case when the dimensionality of the target space is saturated
, d = p + 1 = 2n. dolan-tchrakian [1,2] constructed the corresponding conformally
invariant skyrme-like actions, with vanishing world-volume cosmological constant , based
on these conformally invariant  models in 2n-dimensions. upon the algebraic elimination
of the auxiliary world-volume metric, dolan and tchrakian have shown that one recovers
the dirac-nambu-goto action :

s = t z d2n q|det g|. g, =  x x .

(3)

where g is the induced world-volume metric resulting from the embedding of the p +
1 = 2n hypervolume into the d-dim target spacetime. when the spacetime dimension is
saturated : d = p + 1 = 2n the square root of the dirac-nambu-goto action simplies
and one obtains the usual jacobian for the change of variables from  to x. in such case
the nambu-goto action is topological : there are no physical local transverse degrees of
freedom . such topological actions have been studied by zaikov [11]. for a review of
membranes and other p  branes with extensive references see [12]. the action is then :

s = t z d2n 1x 1  .......  2nx 2n .

(4)

where t is the p-brane ( extendon) tension. for a p-brane whose world-volume has a
natural boundary , an integration ( gauss law) yields :

s = t zv

d2n1 x 1   1 x 2  .......   2n1x 2n .

(5)

one then recovers the action for the chern-simons p brane whose p + 1 world-volume
variables ,  a, a = 1, 2, .....p + 1, are integrated over the 2n  1-dim boundary v of the
2n-dim domain v associated with the world volume of the open p-brane. the value of p
must be such that p + 1 = p = 2n 1 [11]. zaikov concluded that these topological chern
simons p-branes exit only in target spacetimes of dimensionality d = p + 2.
in particular, when the dimensionality of the target spacetime is saturated , d =
p + 1, one can construct, in addition , self-dual p-brane (extendon) solutions obeying the
equations of motion and constraints ( resulting from p + 1 reparametrization invariance of
the world-volume) that are directly related to these topological chern-simons p-branes.
this holds provided p +1 = p and the embedding manifold is euclidean [12]. furthermore,
when d = p+1 = 2n one has conformal invariance a well [1,2]. it is in this fashion how the
relationship between the self dual p-branes and chern simons p = p  1 branes emerges .
this is roughly the analogy with wittens discovery of the one-to-one relationship between
3d nonabelian chern-simons theories and 2d rational cft. [13].

the topological chern-simons action (5) and the action (4) , obtained by using gauss

law , are among the main ones considered in this work.

ii euclidean ads2n as o(2n, 1) -model instantons

3

as a prototype we will imagine a chern-simons membrane living on the euclideanized
ads4 background , which in turn, will be shown to be the instanton eld conguration of
the conformally invariant o(4, 1)  model in r4 obeying the double self-duality condition
to be described below by eq-(8b).

since the conformally invariant euclidean o(5)-model in r4 has a correspondence
with the conformally invariant o(4) ym in r4 [1] it is natural to ask whether the analytical
continuation from o(4, 1)  o(5) will allow to establish the following relationships in four-
dimensions among : topological chern-simons membrane living in ( euclidean) ads4;
instanton congurations of the conformally invariant o(4, 1) -models in r4 and o(4)
yang-mills instantons ( obeying a double self duality condition described below by eq-
(8a)) in r4.

the importance to establish this web of relationships is because one may generalize
this web to higher dimensions with the provision that d = 2n = 4k. for example, in
d = 12 we may have the connections among the chern-simons p = 10-brane moving on
the euclideanized ads12; instantons of the conformally invariant o(12, 1) -models in r12
and o(12) generalized yang-mills (gym) theories in r12 . when the group is compact
like o(2n) , for example, the latter gym are dened by lagrangians [1,10] in rd where
d = 2n = 4k :

l = tr (f 12....2k

1,2....2k 1,2.....2k)2 = (f2  f2....  f2)2. 2n = 4k = d

(6)

with all indices antisymmetrized. 12... is the totally antisymmetrized product ( on
the internal indices ) of the product of k factors of the 22k1  22k1 matrices 12
corresponding to the chiral representation of so(4k).
the exhibiting relationship between the instanton eld congurations of the o(5) 
model and the o(4) ym system in r4 were given by [1] . the order parameter eld of
the o(5)  model is the o(5) vector ni(x) obeying the constraint :ni(x)ni(x) = 1 . the
denition of the gauge elds and eld strengths for the ym system in terms of the ni(x)
are :

aij
 = ni(x)nj(x)  nj(x)ni(x).

f ij
 (x) = aij

 kl     = [n[i]nj].

  aik

(7a)

(7b)

due to the constraint nini = 1 the former eld stength coincides with the denition given
below by eq-(8c). when nini = 1 one should have +aik
 in the denition (7b) instead;
i.e. a change in sign in the coupling constant. these signs subtleties are essential otherwise
the eld strength will be zero.

 alj

an additional constraint allows to reduce o(5)  o(4) :

(i

j + aij

 )ni(x) = 0

(7c)

after using eqs-(7a,7b,7c) the authors [1] have shown that o(4) ym instanton solu-

tions obey a double self duality condition satised by the bpst instanton [9] : :

(8d)

the unit charge instanton solutions of eq-(8b) that minimize the action (8c) and
correspond to the o(4) ym instanton solutions of eq-(8a) were found to be precisely the
ones corresponding to the stereographic projections ( conformal mappings) from r4  s4
[1] :

na(x) =

(na)2 + (n5)2 = 1.

(9)

things dier now for the (noncompact )o(2n, 1) -models due to the subtle signature
changes. now we must see whether or not the o(2n, 1) vector ni(x) with i = 1, 2, ......2n+1
satisfy the double self duality condition

(10)

the stereographic maps from r4 to the euclidean signature ads4 dened by :

na(x) =

obey the condition :

2x

1  x2 ; a = 1, 2, 3, 4.  = 0, 1, 2, 3. n5(x) =

nini  (n1)2 + (n2)2 + (n3)2 + (n4)2  (n5)2 = 1.

(11)

(12)

(13)

which is just the o(4, 1) invariant norm of the vector ni(x) = (n1(x), .....n5(x)) and satisfy
the double-self duality condition condition (8b) as we shall see.

.
before establishing this fact it is important to study the signature dependence in the
denition of the duality operation. for the particlar case when 2n = 4, the double duality
star operation is dened :

f  1212 i1i2i3i4i5 ni5 f i3i4
12 .

(14)

5

the  acting on f is :

f = (1)(1)sb(1)sg (1)f f.

(15)
where (i) the rst factor of 1 stems from the nini = 1 condition. (ii) the second factor
stems from the signature of the base space r4. (iii) the third factor stems from the group
signature which is (1)1 = 1 for o(4, 1). (iv) the last one, (1)f , are additional factors
resulting from the permutation of the indices in the 1....2n and i1....i2n+1 tensors . these
are similar to the (1)r(dr) factor appearing in the double hodge operation. where r
represents the rank of f . in this case they yield the factor 1.
from (15) one immediately concludes that the signature of the base manifold must

be : (+, +, +, +) so that

f = (1)(1)sb(1)sg f = (1)(+1)(1)(1)f = f  ()2 = 1 = 1.

(16a)

and one has a well dened double (anti) self duality condition.

f = f.

(16b)

for higher rank elds, f i1.....in

1.....n it follows from (15) that we must have in addition
that n = even. therefore we conclude that the base manifold must be of euclidean signa-
ture type and have for dimension: r4k and the target group background o(4k, 1), whose
topology is that of the euclideanized ads4k . thus, the maps are signature-preserving
and the dimensionality of the base manifold must be a multiple of four, d = 4k .

it still remains to prove that the o(4k, 1) -eld na(x) given by eqs-(11) solve the
double self duality condition (10); that they saturate the minimum of the action to ensure
topological stability, if indeed such minima exit, which is not necessary the case. also the
instanton solutions must yield a nite valued action; i.e the elds must fall o suciently
fast at innity so the action does not blow up;....

to satisfy these requirements it is essential to prove rstly that the classical action and
classical hamiltonian are positive denite. a close inspection reveals that one should have
an euclidean signature base manifold which forces one to choose an euclidean signature
ads2n space if the condition (16a) is to be satised. therefore, instead of o(2n  1, 2)
one must have o(2n, 1). to illustrate the fact that the classical action is positive denite
and without loss of generality we study the r4,0  ads4,0 case. ( the euclideanization of
ads4). we must show that :

(f ij

 )2 > 0. i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

in d = 4 there are six terms of the form :

g00g11[(f ab

01 )2  (f 5a

01 )2] + g00g22[(f ab

02 )2  (f 5a

02 )2] + .....+

g11g22[(f ab

12 )2  (f 5a

12 )2] + .......

6

(17)

(18)

due to the euclidean nature of the base manifold the g00g11 > 0 so we must show then
that the terms inside the brackets in eq-(18) are all positive denite. the a, b indices run
over : 1, 2, 3, 4 and the last one is the i = 5 component n5 associated with the non-compact
o(4, 1)-valued ni eld. setting ni = (na, n5)  (~, ) the condition nini = 1 yields :

2 = ~.~ + 1 = 2 + 1.

(19)

which implies for every single component of x;  = 0, 1, 2, 3 ( we are not summing over
the x) :

(n5)2 <

2
2 (~).(~);  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

then :

(f 5a

01 )2 =

1
2 [(0a)(~.1~)  (1a)(~.0~)]2 <

2
2 (0a1b  1a0b)2.

where we used the relation ( ~a. ~b)2 < a2b2. the rst term of (18) yields :

(f ab

01 )2  (f 5a

01 )2 > (1 

2
2 )(0a1b  1a0b)2 > 0.

(20)

(21)

(22)

because (1  2
2 ) > 0 due to the relation (19). the same argument applies for each single
 )2 and hence the classical action and hamiltonian are positive denite.
component of (f ij
this is an essential ingredient for the instanton solution to saturate the minimum of the
classical action. from ordinary yang-mills in euclidean space and for compact gauge
groups like su (2) we have the familiar relation :

z d4x (f  f )2 = 2z d4x f 2  2z d4x f f  0  z d4x f 2  z d4x f f

(23)

in the self dual case, the last equality holds. the last integral for the su (2) group (
topologically s3) is the winding number s3  s3, a topological invariant; hence the self
dual instanton obeying f = f saturates the lower bound of the positive denite action
and ensures the topological stability. to nalize one must have that the eld strengths fall
o suciently fast at innity to ensure that the action doesnt blow up : rnf i1...in
1....n  0
as r  .
having shown that the classical action for the o(4, 1) -model in r4 was positive
denite one can follow similar arguments as those in eq-(23) to show that the instanton
solution saturate the lower bound of the classical action.

it remains to prove that the solutions (11) obey the double self duality condition (10)
and fall-o fast enough at innity. the latter property holds and can be seen by inspection.
the former property is a straightforward extension of the results in [1,3] for the compact
case. given the stereographic projections dened by eq-(11) : r2n  h 2n one can nd a
set of independent 2n + 1 frame vectors, ep, representing the pullback of the orthogonal

7

frame vectors of the 2n + 1-dim pseudo-euclidean manifold onto the euclidean signature
ads2n space :

e1 = x1ni; e2 = x2 ni; .....e2n = x2n ni. e2n+1 = ni. i = 1, 2, .....2n + 1

(24)

obeying the orthogonality condition :

g  e i

e i

 = nini =

4

(1  x2)2  .

(25)

which precisely yields the euclideanized ads2n metric g dended as the pullback of the
embedding metric, satisfying r  g  and r  . the latter curvature relations are
the hallmark of anti de sitter space ( negative scalar curvature). the positive denite
measure spanned by the collection of 2n + 1 frame vectors denes the natural volume
element of the euclideanized ads2n :

det h = det (e1, e2, ......, e2n, e2n+1).

(26)

it was shown by [1,3] (for the compact case the orthogonality condition is naturally
modied to yield the metric of the s2n) that the orthogonality conditions eqs-(25) are the
necessary and suf f icient conditions to show that the particular eld congurations ni(x)
given by (11), after extending the four dimensional result to any d = 2n, satisfy the double
self duality conditions eq-(10). the orthogonality relation implies that the angles among
any two vectors is preserved and that all vectors have the same length under the mapping.
this is a signal of a conformal mapping. the stereographic maps are a particular class
of conformal maps. the action of the conformal group in r2n will furnish the remaining
conformal maps [1,3]. hence, we see here once again the interrelation between self-duality
and conformal invariance. in two dimensions self-duality implies conformal invariance (
holomorphicity). in higher dimensions matters are more restricted, they are not equivalent.
therefore, setting aside the subtleties in the quantization program due to the non-
compact nature of o(2n, 1), we have shown that these o(2n, 1) -model instanton eld
congurations obtained by means of the stereographic ( conformal) maps of r2n  h 2n,
correspond precisely to the coordinates, y1, y2, ....y4, y5 of the 5-dim pseudo-euclidean
manifold onto which the euclidean signature ads4 space is embedded. to illustrate this
lets focus on euclidean signature ads4 dened as the geometrical locus :

y2  (y1)2 + (y2)2 + (y3)2 + (y4)2  (y5)2 = 2 = 1.

where we set the ads scale  = 1. the ads4 coordinates : z0, z1, z2, z3 are related to
the ya using the stereographic projection ( see the lectures by petersen [6]) from the
south pole of the euclidean signature ads4 to the equator :

ya(z) = 

2z

1  z2 ;  = 0, 1, 2, 3. a = 1, 2, 3, 4. y5(z) = 

1 + z2

1  z2 .

it is straighforward to verify that y2 = 2 = 1. the euclidean signature ads4 metric
is given :

(27)

(28)

8

g =

4

(1  z2)2 

z2 = (z0)2 + .... + (z3)2.

(29)

there is an exact match with the instanton eld congurations ni(x) (11). the metric
(29) also matches (25) after the correspondence : na(x)  y(z) and n5(x)  y5(z) is
made. at least, locally, the z coordinates of ads4 can always be identied with the x
coordinates of r4. whether this occurs globally is another issue that is not analyzed here.
the lorentz signature ads2n requires a covering, for example. this four dimensional
result can be generalized to higher dimensions in a straightforward fashion.

these conformally invariant o(2n, 1) sigma model actions in r2n are just the sigma
model generalizations of the macdowell-mansouri action for ordinary gravity based on
gauging the conformal group so(4, 2) in d = 4 minkowski space and the anti de sitter
group so(3, 2). the ordinary lorentz spin connection and the tetrad in four dimensions
are just pieces of the so(3, 2) gauge connection. upon setting the torsion to zero one
recovers the 4d einstein-hilbert action with a cosmological constant and the gauss-bonnet
topological term. the conformally invariant sigma models actions [1] are the ones required
in building conformally invariant bosonic p = 2n-brane actions in at or curved target
bcakgrounds. it would be interesting to see what sort of actions can be derived following
the analog of a macdowell-mansouri procedure to obtain einstein gravity from a gauge
theory. .

iii. self-dual p-branes, chern-simons p-branes and w geometry

as pointed in the introduction, zaikov noticed that self-dual p-branes, when p + 1 =
d = 2n, are related to chern-simons p-branes ( p + 1 = p) provided the target space has
euclidean signature [11]. the euclidean ads2n space can be seen, not only as a o(2n, 1) -
model instanton, but also as a self-dual p-brane whose world volume is the ads2n space
(p + 1 = 2n = d dimensional). to see this we must rst write down dolan-tchrakian
action for a bosonic p-brane with p + 1 = 2n embedded in a at/curved target space of
dimensionality d = p + 1 = 2n. dolan-tchrakian action is valid for at or curved target
spacetime metrics [2].

s = t z d2n [e p1  e p2  ...  e pn]  [(e q1  e q2  ....  e qn)]p1q1p2q2.....

(30)

the action is ym like f  f and was derived based on the conformally invariant o(2n, 1) -
model action (8d). the star operation in (30) is the standard hodge duality one dened
w.r.t the p + 1-dim world-volume metric of the p-brane : hab. the world-volume one-forms
, e p; p = 1, 2, ....2n are obtained as the pullbacks of the d = 2n = p + 1 one forms,
ea ; a = 1, 2, ....2n associated with the d = 2n dimensional at/curved target space onto
which we embed the world-volume of the p-brane. a self-dual p-brane ( self dual w.r.t the
hodge star operation) obeys :

[(e q1  e q2  ....  e qn)] = [e p1  e p2  ...  e pn ].

(31)

a self-dual p-brane will automatically satisfy the equations of motion. this is the p-brane
generalization of the relation df = j = 0 in the absence of sources in the ym equations.
when f = f the latter equations become the bianchi identities df = 0. the action (30)
for a self-dual p-brane becomes then the integral over the ordinary jacobian ( p + 1 = 2n
volume form) associated with the change of variables   x and hence is topological. if
the world volume has a natural boundary an integration by parts ( gauss law) will yield
the chern-simons p = p  1-brane. in this way we can see once more how the self-dual
p-brane is related to the chern-simons p = p  1-brane ( at least on shell).
this is the rst step. one needs to show now that the self-duality condition (31) is
directly related to the self-duality condition formulated by zaikov when p + 1 = 2n and,
furthermore, that it is also related to the double-self duality conditions (10) associated with
the conformally invariant o(2n, 1) -models in r2n. the self-duality condition formulated
by zaikov when the embedding manifold is euclidean and when p + 1 = 4, for example, is
[11] :

ab = ax j bx k  bx j ax k =
f j k

1
4

abcdj klmf lm
cd .

(32)

where x i(a) are the embedding coordinates of the p-brane into the target space ( at or
curved ) parametrized by the coordinates x i; i = 1, 2, ...2n. eq-(32) is the self-duality
condition for case when p = 3 ; p + 1 = 4. the self-duality condition of zaikov has
exactly the same form as the double self-duality condition for the o(4) ym instanton
(8a), obtained from the compact o(2n + 1)  model, after using the constraint (7c),
d(a)ni = 0 ; i = 1, 2, ...2n, 2n + 1 ( for the particular case n = 1 ), and the relations
(7a,7b) which allow to reduce o(5) to o(4) and show that the o(4) ym eld is a composite
eld expressed in terms of the ni. we need now to establish the relations/correspondences
between the p-brane coordinates x i(a) of (32) and the o(4) ym composite elds of
eqs-(7a,7b) appearing in eq-(8a). the ensuing relation is :

a
   x j (a). f 

   f j k

ab = ax j bx k  bx j a x k.

(33)

where  are the 2  2 matrices ( pauli) corresponding to the chiral representation
of so(4)  su (2)  su (2). the , .. indices in the l.h.s of (33) run over the four
dimensional base manifold r4 where the o(4) ym elds live. the i, j, k... in the r.h.s of
(33) run over the four-dimensional embedding target space . the a indices run over the
four-dimensional world volume of the p = 3-brane.

the last equation is reminiscent of the chiral model approaches to self dual gravity
based on self dual yang mills [31] theories. a moyal deformation quantization of a su (2)
ym [32] theory yields the classical n   limit of su (n ) ym directly, without ever
using the  matrices of the large n matrix models. by simply taking the classical h =
0 limit of the moyal brackets, the ordinary poisson bracket algebra, associated with area-
preserving dis algebra su (), is automatically recovered. this supports furthermore the
fact that the underlying geometry may be noncommutative [18,32] and that p-branes are
essentially gauge theories of area/volume...preserving dis [14,20,21].

10

therefore, the self-duality conditions of the dolan-tchrakian p-brane actions when
p + 1 = 4 (31) have a one-to-one correspondence with zaikovs self-duality conditions (32)
and with the double self-duality conditions of the o(4) ym instanton (8a), if, and only if,
the gauge f ields/target space coordinates correspondence (33) is used.

finally, if the euclidean signature ads2n space is to be seen as a self-dual p-brane; i.e.
as the euclideanized world-volume of a self-dual p-brane such p + 1 = 2n, in addition to
an o(2n, 1) -model instanton in r2n, we must analytically continue o(2n, 1) to o(2n +
1) and , afterwards, follow the same procedure as above, relating the o(5) -model to
o(4) ym and its generalized yang-mills extensions in d = 2n = 4k dimensions [10].
for example, one could rst reduce o(4, 1) to o(3, 1) using equations like (7a,7b,7c) and
perform aftewards the analytical continuation o(3, 1) to o(4) . it is important to have
a compact group like o(4) otherwise we will run into the same problems of non-positive
denite actions, hamiltonians... to sum up, the arguments ranging from eqs-(31-33),
are the ones required that would allow us to view the euclidean ads2n space as the
euclideanized world volume of a self-dual p-brane ( p + 1 = 2n) in addition to being an
o(2n, 1) -model instanton .

after having presented the discussion of the self-dual p-branes /chern-simons p =
p1-branes relationship in target spacetimes of dimension d = p+1 = p+2 = 2n = 4k, we
will choose a particular higher dimensional example. the topological chern-simons action
for the p = 10-brane is dened over the d = 11-boundary domain of r12 . boundary
to-boundary maps are a special class, among the innite family of embeddings of the
chern-simons p = 10-brane into ads12, which conformally map the d = 11-dim boundary
domain into the projective boundary of the ads12 space :which is topologically s1  s10.
the euclidean signature ads12 has, instead, for projective boundary the s11. the
signature matching condition (16a) imposes the signature of the base manifold to be eu-
clidean . if one views r12 as the interior of a twelve-dimensional ball, b12 of very large
() radius, the d = 11 boundary domain is eectively s11 . therefore, for the very special
case associated with boundary to-boundary maps, the chern-simons p = 10-brane can be
characterized by the winding number of the mappings of s11  s11 . in this special case,
the chern-simons p = 10-brane lives eectively on the projective boundary of euclidean
ads12. we emphasize that this is just a particular case, since in general, the topological
chern-simons p = 10-brane lives on the whole bulk of ads12. since the chern-simons
p = 10-brane theory is topological, it has no local bulk degrees of freedom, only global,
that are naturally conned to the boundary. in this sense the theory is holographic [27,28].
furthermore, since ads12 can be seen as a hyperboloid embedded in a d = 13-dim
pseudo-euclidean manifold we have d = 11, 12, 13 for characteristic dimensions; hence this
construction may be relevant to understand the intricate relations of m, f, s theory [25,26]
and to shed some light into the geometrical, holographic and topological underpinnings
behind the ads/cft duality conjecture.

a chern-simons p = 11-brane living on a euclidean signature ads13 embedded in
a d = 14-dim pseudo euclidean space has for world volume a 12-dim manifold. in this
case the relevant dimensions would be 11, 12, 13, 14. the main dierence is that the odd
dimensional ads13 will not corespond to an instanton conguration associated with an
o(13, 1) -model because in odd dimensions conformally invariant sigma models of the

11

dolan-tchrakian type cannot be constructed. higher dimensional topological actions have
been proposed by chapline to describe unique theories of gravity and matter [24].

mainly what we have established in this work is : a topological chern-simons p-
branes and conformally invariant  models on ads spaces relationship. what remains
is to establish the relationship with o(2n) generalized ym theories in r4k. [10]; i.e. the
correspondence between o(2n, 1)  models, after a wick rotation and a futher reduction
from o(2n + 1) to o(2n). moreover, to generalize these relations to arbitrary manifolds
other than r4k. this is a prospect that warrants investigation closing the web among
three related theories : chern-simons p-branes on ads2n spaces with p + 2 = 2n; o(2n, 1)
conformally invariant  models in r2n with target euclideanized ads2n backgrounds
and o(2n) gym theories in r2n. and nally, the relationship between self duality and
conformal invariance. the euclidean signature ads2n space was shown to correspond
precisely to instanton eld congurations of the noncompact o(2n, 1) -models in r2n,
obeying the double self duality condition (10), which was the analog of the bpst instanton
[9].

to nalize we shall mention our belief in the importance that w symmetry and its
higher dimensional extensions should have in understanding m theory . w geometry was
viewed as the geometry associated with the moyal-fedosov deformation program associ-
ated with the symplectic geometry of the cotangent bundles of 2d riemannian surfaces;
the role of 4d self dual gravity was also emphasized in [18]. geometric induced actions
for w gravity based on the coadjoint orbit method associated with sl(, r) wznw
models were constructed by nissimov, pacheva and vaysburd [23]. w gravity has a hid-
den sl(, r) kac-moody symmetry. likewise, the sl() toda model obtained from a
rotational killing symmetry reduction of 4d self dual gravity ( an eective 3d theory)
has w symmetry. once again we can see the intricate relationship between self duality
and conformal eld theory in higher dimensions.

to this end we concentrate now on what perhaps is the most signicant and salient
feature of chern-simons p-branes : the fact that they admit an innite number of sec-
ondary constraints which form an innite dimensional closed algebra with respect to the
poisson bracket. [11] such algebra contains the clasical w1+ as a subalgebra . the latter
algebra corresponds to the area-preserving dieomorphisms of a cylinder.; the w alge-
bra corresponds to the area-preserving dis of a plane; su() for a sphere.....[14]. these
w algebras are the higher conformal spin s = 2, 3, 4..... algebraic extensions of the 2d
virasoro algebra.

higher spin algebras ( superalgebras) in dimensions greater than two have been fur-
nished by vasiliev and in [15] were used to describe higher spin gauge interactions of massive
particles in ads3 spaces. these higher spin algebras have been instrumental lately in [16]
to construct the n = 8 higher spin supergravity in ads4 which is conjectured to be the
eld theory limit of m theory on ads4  s7.
crucial in the construction of the vasiliev higher spin algebras is the moyal star
products and the fact that these algebras required an anti de sitter space. for the relevance
of moyal brackets in m theory we refer to fairlie [19]. it has been speculated that the
w-symmetry of w strings after a higgs-like spontaneous symmetry breakdown yields
the innite massive tower of string states. in particular, anomaly free non-criticial (super)

12

w strings required (d = 11) d = 27 dimensions [22] which are precisely the alleged
critical dimensions of the ( super) membrane.

moyal star products are non-local due to the innite number of derivatives. this
nonlocality in conjunction with the fact that anti de sitter spaces are required may be
relevant in understanding more properties of singleton, doubleton...eld theories which are
very important in the ads/cf t duality conjecture. the massless excitations of the cf t
living on the projective boundary of anti de sitter space, associated with the propagation
of the supermembrane on adsd  sdd, are composites of singleton, doubletons...elds
[17]. the o(5) sigma models actions (8c) and the corresponding o(4)y m elds in eqs-
(7a,7b) are based on composite f ields ; i.e made out of the ni(x). new actions for all
p-branes where the analogs of s and t duality symmetries were built in, already from
the start, were given in [20] based on the composite antisymmetric tensor eld theories of
the volume-preserving dis group of guendelman, nissimov , pacheva and the local eld
theory reformulation of extended objects given by aurilia, spallucci and smailagic [21].
this supports the idea that compositeness may be a crucial ingredient in the formulation
of m theory.

concluding, we believe that m theory should have some of the features described

below :

 higher dimensional topological and holographic origins. a particular example of
this theory is the topological chern-simons p = 10-brane living on the bulk of ads12,
without local degres of freedom , with only global degrees of freedom conned to the
d = 11 dimensional boundary. since ads12 can be embedded in a d = 13 dimensional
pseudo euclidean space, d = 13 is a relevant dimension [24]. .

above, to higher dimensions.

 a w geometric framework extending the role of ordinary 2d cft, as explained
 a compositeness structure, like the conformally invariant sigma models in r2n with
target noncompact o(2n, 1) group manifolds and where the euclidean signature ads2n
space is both an instanton solution, obeying a double self duality condition, and a self-
dual p-brane ( extendon, with p + 1 = 2n).

 the supersymmetric case has not been discussed here but it must be included.
 we close this work with an interesting thought. the n   limit of the o(2n, 1) -
models is connected with the d = 2n   limit of the ads2n space. interestingly enough,
zaikov has pointed out that in the d =  limit these chern-simons p-branes acquire true
local dynamics !
