the relation between su (2) yang-mills mechanics, originated from the 4-
dimensional su (2) yang-mills theory under the supposition of spatial homogeneity
of the gauge elds, and the euler-calogero-moser model is discussed in the frame-
work of hamiltonian reduction. two kinds of reductions of the degrees of freedom
are considered: due to the gauge invariance and due to the discrete symmetry. in the
former case, it is shown that after elimination of the gauge degrees of freedom from
the su (2) yang-mills mechanics the resulting unconstrained system represents the
id3 euler-calogero-moser model with an external fourth-order potential. whereas in
the latter, the ia6 euler-calogero-moser model embedded in an external potential is
derived whose projection onto the invariant submanifold through the discrete symme-
try coincides again with the su (2) yang-mills mechanics. based on this connection,
the equations of motion of the su (2) yang-mills mechanics in the limit of the zero
coupling constant are presented in the lax form.

i. introduction

the present note is devoted to the discussion of the correspondence between the dynamics of 3-
particles with internal degrees interacting by pairwise 1/r3 forces on a line (euler-calogero-moser
system [1,2]) and su (2) yang-mills theory with spatially constant gauge elds (su (2) yang-mills
mechanics [3] (see also [4,5] and references therein)).

the euler-calogero-moser model is the extension of the famous calogero-sutherland-moser models
[68] (for its generalizations see [9] and reviews [10,11]) with additional dynamical internal degrees
of freedom included. it is interesting that these types of models arises in various areas of theoretical
physics like the 2-dimensional yang-mills theory [12], black hole physics [13], spin chain systems [14],
generalized statistics [15], higher spin theories [16], level dynamics for quantum systems [17], quantum
hall eect [18] and many others. an attractive feature of these generalizations is that it maintains
the integrability property of the original calogero-sutherland-moser system. for the general elliptic
version of the euler-calogero-moser system, the action-angle type variables have been constructed and
the equations of motion have been solved in terms of riemannian theta-functions [19], the canonical
symplectic form of this model is represented in terms of algebro-geometric data [20] using the general
construction of krichever and phong [21].

during the past years a remarkable relation between the calogero-moser systems and the exact
solutions of 4-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories has been found [22]. it has been recognized
that the so-called seiberg-witten spectral curves are identical to the spectral curves of the elliptic
su (n ) calogero-moser system [23]. furthermore the generalization of these relations to the n = 2
supersymmetric gauge theories with general lie algebras and an adjoint representation of matter
hypermultiplet have been derived in [24] (for review of the recent results see, e.g., [25]).

despite the existence of such a correspondence established on very general grounds, relations be-
tween gauge theories and integrable models are far from being understood. in the present note, we
would like to point out a simple direct correspondence between the su (2) yang-mills theory and the
euler-calogero-moser model. this correspondence follows from the sequence of reductions of degrees
of freedom thanks to dierent kinds of symmetries. at rst, supposing the spatial homogeneity of
gauge elds, the eld theory is reduced to the 9-dimensional degenerate lagrangian model. then the
pure gauge variables are eliminated by applying the method of hamiltonian reduction. finally, rewrit-
ing the derived unconstrained matrix model in terms of special coordinates adapted to the action of
rigid symmetry, one can arrive at the conventional form of the euler-calogero-moser hamiltonian.
more precisely, we shall demonstrate that the unconstrained su (2) yang-mills mechanics represents
the euler-calogero-moser system of type id3, i.e., the inverse-square interacting 3-particle system
with internal degrees of freedom related to the root system of simple lie algebra d3 [10,11], and is
embedded in a fourth order external potential written in the superpotential form.

besides this reduction due to the continuous symmetry of the system, we discuss another possibility
of relating the yang-mills mechanics to higher order matrix models using the discrete symmetries.
we shall explore the method of constructing generalizations of the calogero-sutherland-moser models
elaborated recently by a. polychronakos [26]. this method consists in the usage of the appropriate
reduction of the original calogero model by a subset of its discrete symmetries to an invariant sub-
manifold of the phase space. representing the euler-calogero-moser system with a special external
potential as a 6 6 symmetric matrix model, we shall show that such a matrix model, after projection
onto the invariant submanifold of the phase space using a certain subset of discrete symmetries, is
equivalent to the unconstrained su (2) yang-mills mechanics. finally, we give a lax pair representa-
tion for the equations of motion of the su (2) yang-mills mechanics in the limit of the zero coupling
constant.

ii. hamiltonian reduction of the yang-mills mechanics

a. the equivalent unconstrained matrix model

the dynamics of the su (2) yang-mills 1-form a in 4-dimensional minkowski space-time m4 is

governed by the conventional local functional

sy m =

1

2zm4

tr f  f ,

(2.1)

dened in terms of the curvature 2-form f = da + g a  a , with the coupling constant g. after the
supposition of the spatial homogeneity of the connection a

the action (2.1) reduces to the action for a nite dimensional model, the so-called yang-mills mechanics
(ymm) described by the degenerate matrix lagrangian

a = 0 ,

li

(2.2)

ly mm =

1
2

tr(cid:0)(dta)(dta)t(cid:1)  v (a) ,

the entries of the 3  3 matrix a are nine spatial components aai := aa
i of the connection a :=
yaeadt + aaieadxi , where ea = a/2i with the pauli matrices a and dt denotes the covariant
derivative (dta)ai = aai + gabcybaci . due to the spatial homogeneity condition (2.2), all dynamical
variables ya and aai are functions of time only. the part of the lagrangian corresponding to the
self-interaction of the gauge elds is gathered in the potential v (a)

(2.3)

2

g2

v (a) =

4 (cid:0)tr2(aat )  tr(aat )2(cid:1) .

(2.4)

to express the yang-mills mechanics in a hamiltonian form, let us dene the phase space endowed with
the canonical symplectic structure and spanned by the canonical variables (ya, pya) and (aai, eai)
where

pya =

l
 ya

= 0 , eai =

l
 aai

= aai + gabcybaci .

(2.5)

according to these denitions of the canonical momenta (2.5), the phase space is restricted by the
three primary constraints

p a

y = 0

(2.6)

and the evolution of the system is governed by the total hamiltonian ht = hc + ua
the canonical hamiltonian is given by

y (t) p a

y , where

hc =

1
2

tr(eet ) +

g2

4 (cid:0)tr2(aat )  tr(aat )2(cid:1) + gya tr(jaaet ) ,

(2.7)

and the matrix (ja)bc is dened by (ja)bc = abc. the conservation of constraints (2.6) in time
entails the further condition on the canonical variables

a = g tr(jaaet ) = 0 ,

(2.8)

that reproduces the homogeneous part of the conventional non-abelian gauss law constraints. they
are the rst class constraints obeying the poisson brackets algebra

{a, b} = abcc .

(2.9)

in order to project onto the reduced phase space, we use the well-known polar decomposition for an
arbitrary 3  3 matrix

aai(, q) = oak()qki ,

(2.10)

where qij is a positive denite 3  3 symmetric matrix and o(1, 2, 3) = e1j3e2j1 e3j3 is an
orthogonal matrix o  so(3). assuming the nondegenerate character of the matrix aai, we can treat
the polar decomposition as uniquely invertible transformation from the conguration variables aai
to a new set of six lagrangian coordinates qij and three coordinates i. as it follows from further
consideration, the variables parameterizing the elements of the so(3) group (euler angles (1, 2, 3))
are the pure gauge degrees of freedom.

the eld strength eai in terms of the new canonical variables is

eai = oak()(cid:20) pki + kil(1)lj(cid:2)l

j  sj(cid:3)(cid:21) ,

where l

a are three left-invariant vector elds on so(3)

(2.13)

(2.14)

here sj = jmn(p q)mn is the spin vector of the gauge eld and

ik = qik  ik trq .

(2.15)

reformulation of the theory in terms of these variables allows one to easily achieve the abelianization
of the secondary gauss law constraints. using the representations (2.10) and (2.11), one can convince
oneself that the variables qij and pij make no contribution to the secondary constraints (2.8)

a = oab() l

b = 0 .

(2.17)

we nd the set of abelian constraints equivalent to the gauss law (2.8)

a = pa = 0 .

(2.18)

after having rewritten the model in this form, we are able to reduce the theory to physical phase space
by a straightforward projection onto the constraint shell . the resulting unconstrained hamiltonian,
dened as a projection of the total hamiltonian onto the constraint shell

can be written in terms of qab and pab as

hy mm := hc (qab , pab)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)pa=0 , p a

where mmn = (qp  p q)mn denotes the gauge eld spin tensor.

(2.19)

(2.20)

b. unconstrained model as particle motion on stratied manifold

in the previous section, the unconstrained dynamics of the su(2) yang-mills mechanics was iden-
tied with the dynamics of the nondegenerate matrix model (2.20). the conguration space q of the
real symmetric 3  3 matrices can be endowed with the at riemannian metric

whose group of isometry is formed by orthogonal transformations

ds2 = tr(cid:0)dq2(cid:1)

q = rqrt

(2.21)

(2.22)

since the unconstrained hamiltonian system (2.20) is invariant under the action of this rigid group,
we are interested in the structure of the orbit space given as a quotient q/so(3). the important
information on the stratication of the space q/so(3) of orbits can be obtained from the so-called
isotropy group of points of conguration space which is dened as a subgroup of so(3) leaving point
x invariant rxrt = x. orbits with the same isotropy group are collected into classes, called by strata.
so, as for the case of symmetric matrix, the orbits are uniquely parameterized by the set of ordered
eigenvalues of the matrix q x1  x2  x3. one can classify the orbits according to the isotropy groups
which are determined by the degeneracies of the matrix eigenvalues:

4

1. principal orbit-type strata, when all eigenvalues are unequal x1 < x2 < x3 with the smallest

isotropy group z2  z2 .

2. singular orbit type strata forming the boundaries of orbit space with

(a) two coinciding eigenvalues x1 = x2, x2 = x3 or x1 = x3, the isotropy group is so(2)  z2 .
(b) all three eigenvalues are equal x1 = x2 = x3, here the isotropy group coinciding with the

isometry group so(3).

in the subsequent sections, we shall demonstrate that the dynamics of the yang-mills mechanics,
which takes place on the principal orbits is governed by the id3 euler-calogero model hamiltonian
j , while for singular orbits the corresponding system
is either the a2 calogero model with the external potential v (2) := g2/2(x4 + 2 x2y2) for singular
orbits of type (a) or one dimensional system with quartic potential v (1) := 3/2g2x4 for singular orbits
of type (b).

with the external potential v (3) := g2/2pi<j x2

i x2

1. hamiltonian on principal orbit strata

to write down the hamiltonian describing the motion on the principal orbit strata, we introduce
the coordinates along the slices xi and along the orbits . namely, we decompose the nondegenerate
symmetric matrix q as

q = rt (1, 2, 3)d r(1, 2, 3)

(2.23)

with the so(3) matrix r parameterized by the three euler angles i := (1, 2, 3) and the diagonal
matrix d = diag (x1, x2, x3) and consider it as point transformation from the physical coordinates
qab and pab to xi, pi and i, pi . the jacobian of this transformation is the relative volume of orbits

and is regular for this stratum x1 < x2 < x3.

by using the generating function

f [xi, i; p ] = tr (qp ) = tr (cid:0)rt ()d(x)r()p(cid:1)

the canonical conjugate momenta can be found in the form

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

pi =

= tr(cid:0)prt ir(cid:1) ,

pi =

where i are the diagonal members of the orthogonal basis for the symmetric 3  3 matrices a =
(i, i) i = 1, 2, 3 under the scalar product

tr(a , b) = ab ,

tr(a , b) = 2ab ,

tr(a , b) = 0 .

the original physical momenta pik can then be expressed in terms of the new canonical variables as

p = rt   3

they satisfy the poisson bracket algebra

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

thus, nally, we get the following physical hamiltonian dened on the unconstrained phase space

(2.33)

(2.34)

(2.35)

note that the potential term in (2.35) has symmetry beyond the cyclic one. this fact allows us to

write v (3)(x1, x2, x3) in the form

v (3)(x1, x2, x3) =

w (3)

w (3)
xa

,

a = 1, 2, 3

(2.36)

with the superpotential w (3) = x1x2x3.

this completes our reduction of the spatially homogeneous yang-mills system to the equivalent
unconstrained system describing the dynamics of the physical dynamical degrees of freedom. we see
that the reduced hamiltonian hy mm on the principal orbit strata is exactly the hamiltonian of the
euler-calogero-moser system of type id3, i.e., is of the inverse-square interacting 3-particle system
with internal degrees of freedom and related to the root system of the simple lie algebra d3 [10,11]
embedded in the fourth order external potential (2.36).

iii. euler-calogero-moser system as a free motion on space of

symmetric matrices

in order to discuss the relation between the yang-mills mechanics and the euler-calogero-moser
system, it is useful to represent the later in the form of a nondegenerate matrix model. let us consider
the hamiltonian system with the phase space spanned by the n  n symmetric matrices x and p
with the noncanonical symplectic form

(acbd  adbc) .

the hamiltonian of the system dened as

(3.1)

(3.2)

describes a free motion in the matrix conguration space. the following statement is fullled:

tonian

(3.3)

(3.5)

to nd the adapted set of coordinates in which the hamiltonian (3.2) coincides with the euler-

calogero-moser hamiltonian (3.3), let us introduce new variables

1 this system is the spin generalization of the calogero-moser model. particles are described by their
coordinates xi and momenta pi together with internal degrees of freedom of angular momentum type lij =  lji.
the analogous model has been introduced in [1] where the internal degrees of freedom satisfy the following
poisson brackets relations

{lab, lcd} = bclad  adlcb .

(3.10)

from this, it is clear that the hamiltonian (3.2) coincides with the euler-calogero-moser hamiltonian
(3.3).

the integration of the hamilton equations of motion

x = p ,

p = 0

(3.11)

derived with the help of hamiltonian (3.2), gives the solution of the euler-calogero-moser hamiltonian
system as follows:
for the x-coordinates we need to compute the eigenvalues of the matrix x =
x(0) + p (0)t, while the orthogonal matrix o, which diagonalizes x, determines the time evolution of
internal variables.

iv. yang-mills mechanics through the discrete reduction of

euler-calogero-moser system

in this section, we shall demonstrate how the su (2) yang-mills mechanics arises from the higher
dimensional matrix model after projection onto a certain invariant submanifold determined by the
discrete symmetries. let us consider the classical hamiltonian system of n particles on a line with
internal degrees of freedom embedded in external eld with the potential v (x1, x2, . . . , xn ) and de-
scribed by the hamiltonian

of freedom of angular momentum type lij =  lji. the nonvanishing poisson brackets are

{xi, pj} = ij

{lab, lcd} = aclbd  adlbc + bdlac  bclad .

(4.2)

the external potential v (n )(x1, x2, . . . , xn ) is constructed in terms of the superpotential w (n )

(4.3)

(4.4)

below it is useful to treat the internal degrees of freedom entering into the hamiltonian (4.1) in the

cartesian form

where the internal variables ya and a combine the canonical pairs with the canonical symplectic form.
the hamiltonian (4.1) has the following discrete symmetries [26]:

i (cid:19) ,

(cid:18) yi
i (cid:19) 7(cid:18) ym(i)

m(i) (cid:19) ,

where m is the element of the permutation group sn . the manifold of phase space dened as

xa + xn a+1 = 0 ,
ya + yn a+1 = 0 ,

pa + pn a+1 = 0 ,
a + n a+1 = 0

is invariant under the action of the symmetry group z = d(z) where

d = p  m

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

and m is specied as m (a) = n  a + 1 .
in order to project onto the manifold described by constraints (4.8)-(4.9) , we use the dirac method
to deal with the second class constraints. let us introduce the dirac brackets between the arbitrary
functions f and g of all variables (xa, pa, ya, a) as

{f , g}d = {f , g}  {f , za}{za , zb}1{zb , g}

(4.11)

2 writing the superpotential in an invariant form as

w (n) = idetx ,

with the help of a symmetric n  n matrix x whose eigenvalues are x1, x2, . . . , xn , the external potential
reads
v (n)(x1, x2, . . . , xn ) = detxtr(x 2) .

(a + n a+1)

{a, b} = {a, b} = {a, b} = { a, b} = 0 ,
{a, b} = ab ,

{ a, b} = ab .

thus, the fundamental dirac brackets are

{xa, pb}d =

ab ,

{ya, b}d =

1
2

ab .

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

after the introduction of these new brackets, one can treat all constraints in the strong sense.
letting the constraint functions vanish, the system with hamiltonian (4.1) reduces to the following
one

taking into account that after projection onto the constraint shell (cs) (4.12)-(4.13) , the potential

v. lax pair representation for yang-mills mechanics in zero

coupling limit

the conventional perturbative scheme of non-abelian gauge theories starts with the zero approxi-
mation of the free theory. however, the limit of the zero coupling constant is not quite trivial. if the
coupling constant in the initial yang-mills action vanish, the non-abelian gauge symmetry reduces to
the u (1) u (1) u (1) symmetry. in this section, we shall discuss this free theory limit for the case of
the unconstrained yang-mills mechanics. the solution of the corresponding zero coupling limit of the
yang-mills mechanics in the form of a lax representation will be given. the relation between (4.1)
and (4.17) allows one to construct the lax pair for the free part of the hamiltonian (4.17) (g = 0)
using the known lax pair for the euler-calogero-moser system (4.1) without an external potential
term (g = 0).

according to the work of s.wojciechowski [2] , the lax pair for the system with hamiltonian

hecm =

aab = (1  ab)
and the equations of motion in lax form are

l = [a, l] ,
l = [a, l] ,

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.5)

where the matrix (l)ab = lab.

the introduction of dirac brackets allows one to use the lax pair of higher dimensional euler-
calogero-moser model (namely a6) for the construction of lax pairs (ly mm , ay mm ) of free yang-
mills mechanics by performing the projection onto the constraint shell (4.12)-(4.13)

lecm
66 |cs = ly mm ,

aecm
66 |cs = ay mm .

thus, the explicit form of the lax pair matrices for the free su (2) yang-mills mechanics is given
