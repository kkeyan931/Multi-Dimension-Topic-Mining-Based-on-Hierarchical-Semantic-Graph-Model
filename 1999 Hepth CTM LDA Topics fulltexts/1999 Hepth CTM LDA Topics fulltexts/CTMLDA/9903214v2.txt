abstract

we construct the non-linear kaluza-klein ansatze describing the embeddings of the
u (1)3, u (1)4 and u (1)2 truncations of d = 5, d = 4 and d = 7 gauged supergravities

into the type iib string and m-theory. these enable one to oxidise any associated lower

dimensional solutions to d = 10 or d = 11. in particular, we use these general ansatze to

embed the charged ads5, ads4 and ads7 black hole solutions in ten and eleven dimensions.

the charges for the black holes with toroidal horizons may be interpreted as the angular

momenta of d3-branes, m2-branes and m5-branes spinning in the transverse dimensions,

in their near-horizon decoupling limits. the horizons of the black holes coincide with the

worldvolumes of the branes. the kaluza-klein ansatze also allow the black holes with

spherical or hyperbolic horizons to be reinterpreted in d = 10 or d = 11.

introduction

anti-de sitter black hole solutions of gauged extended supergravities [1] are currently at-

tracting a good deal of attention [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] due, in large part, to the

correspondence between anti-de sitter space and conformal eld theories on its boundary

[13, 14, 15, 16]. these gauged extended supergravities can arise as the massless modes of

various kaluza-klein compactications of both d = 11 and d = 10 supergravities. the

three examples studied in the paper will be gauged d = 4, n = 8 so(8) supergravity
[17, 18] arising from d = 11 supergravity on s7 [19, 20] whose black hole solutions are

discussed in [7]; gauged d = 5, n = 8 so(6) supergravity [21, 22] arising from type iib
supergravity on s5 [23, 24, 25] whose black hole solutions are discussed in [2, 6]; and gauged
d = 7, n = 4 so(5) supergravity [21, 26] arising from d = 11 supergravity on s4 [27]

whose black hole solutions are given in section 4.2 and in [9, 28].1 in the absence of the black

holes, these three ads compactications are singled out as arising from the near-horizon

geometry of the extremal non-rotating m2, d3 and m5 branes [29, 30, 31, 32]. one of our

goals will be to embed these known lower-dimensional black hole solutions into ten or eleven

dimensions, thus allowing a higher dimensional interpretation in terms of rotating m2, d3

and m5-branes.

since these gauged supergravity theories may be obtained by consistently truncating

the massive modes of the full kaluza-klein theories, it follows that all solutions of the

lower-dimensional theories will also be solutions of the higher-dimensional ones [33, 34]. in

principle, therefore, once we know the kaluza-klein ansatz for the massless sector, it ought

to be straightforward to read o the higher dimensional solutions. it practice, however, this
is a formidable task. the correct massless ansatz for the s7 compactication took many
years to nalize [35, 36], and is still highly implicit, while for the s5 and s4 compacti-

cations, the complete massless ansatze are still unknown. for our present purposes, it

suces to consider truncations of the gauged supergravities to include only gauge elds in
the cartan subalgebras of the full gauge groups, namely u (1)4, u (1)3 and u (1)2 for the s7,
s5 and s4 compactications, respectively. these truncated theories will admit respectively

the 4-charge ads4, 3-charge ads5 and 2-charge ads7 black hole solutions.

the simplest of the three is perhaps the d = 5, n = 8 maximal gauged supergravity,

for which there is a consistent n = 2 (i.e. minimal) truncation to supergravity coupled to

1bps black holes arising in the su (2)  su (2) version of gauged n = 4 supergravity in d = 4, which is
the massless sector of the s3  s3 compactication of n = 1 supergravity in d = 10, were discussed in [5].

these solutions are not asymptotically ads.

two abelian vector multiplets. this has the bosonic eld content of a graviton, three u (1)

gauge elds and two scalars. in this paper we obtain the complete non-linear kaluza-klein
ansatz for the compactication of d = 10 type iib supergravity on s5, truncated to the
u (1)3 cartan subgroup of so(6).

in four dimensions there is a consistent truncation of gauged n = 8 maximal supergrav-

ity to gauged n = 2 supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets. the bosonic sector

consists of a graviton, four vectors and three complex scalars, whose real and imaginary
parts correspond to three axions and three dilatons. 2 the inclusion of the axions

is necessary for providing a consistent truncation; the full bosonic lagrangian in this case
is obtained in appendix b. this truncation corresponds to the u (1)4 cartan subgroup of

the non-abelian so(8), for which there exist ads black hole solutions with four electric

charges [7]. while one would ideally wish to obtain a complete kaluza-klein ansatz for the

n = 2 truncation, in practice the complexity arising from the inclusion of the axions is

considerable. thus in the present paper we omit the axions in the kaluza-klein reduction.

this is of course sucient for the embedding of the electric black hole solutions in d = 11

as they do not involve the axions.

finally, in seven dimensions, maximal n = 4 gauged so(5) supergravity admits a

consistent truncation to n = 2 supergravity, comprising the metric, a 2-form potential, three

vectors and a dilaton, coupled to a vector multiplet comprising a vector and three scalars.
we obtain the kaluza-klein ansatz for an s4 reduction of d = 11 supergravity, including
two u (1)2 gauge elds and two dilatonic scalars. this is sucient for the consideration of

the embedding of the d = 7 black holes in d = 11.

having obtained the explicit kaluza-klein reduction ansatze, this allows an investigation

of the embedding of the various ads black holes of d = 4, d = 5 and d = 7 in the respective

higher-dimensional supergravities. an important point here is that one must know the exact

kaluza-klein reduction ansatz for the reduction of the supergravity theory itself, and not

just for a specic solution, in order to show that the metric, gauge elds and scalar elds of

the lower-dimensional solution are indeed precisely embeddable in the higher-dimensional

2interestingly enough, the ungauged version of this theory obtained by switching o the gauge coupling
and performing some dualisations, appears in the t 2 compactication of d = 6, n = 1 string theory. the

four vectors are the two kaluza-klein and two winding gauge elds, while the three complex scalars s, t

and u correspond to the axion-dilaton, the kahler form and complex structure of the torus. this st u

system plays a crucial role in four-dimensional string/string/string triality [37]. the black hole solutions
of this theory [38, 37], and their embedding in ungauged n = 8 supergravity [39, 40] arising from the t 7

compactication of m -theory as intersections [41, 42] are also well known.

theory. it is worth remarking, in this regard, that it is the scalar elds that present most

of the subtleties and complexities in the implementation of the reduction procedure.

having embedded these black holes in ten or eleven dimensions, an interesting question

then arises as to their higher-dimensional interpretation. it was noted some time ago [43],
in the context of a test membrane moving in a xed ads4  s7, that a 4-dimensional
bps state (whose ads energy is equal to its electric charge) admits the eleven-dimensional

interpretation of an m2-brane [44, 45] that is rotating in the extra dimensions. moreover,

the electric charge is equal to the spin.

recently there has been an upsurge of activities on the study of rotating p-branes [46,

47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 8, 9, 10, 52, 53, 54, 55]. in particular, in [8] ads reissner-nordstrom black

holes (i.e. the charged black holes without scalars) of ads supergavity in d = 4 and d = 5

were studied, and shown to be related to the rotating solutions of m-/string theory. in [9]

the near-extreme spinning d3-brane with one angular momentum was shown to reproduce
the metric and the gauge elds of the large (k = 0+ limit) of d = 5 gauged supergravity

black holes [6], with the anticipation that the result would generalises to multiple angular

momenta. however, the identication of the scalar elds was not given. (in addition, in

[9, 10], the equivalence of the thermodynamics of the near-extreme spinning branes and

the corresponding large black holes of d = 4, 5, 7 gauged supergravity was given.) while

incomplete, these works provided some initial stages in the investigation of the sphere

compactications of m-/string theory.

unlike black holes that are asymptotically minkowskian, for which the horizons are

always spherical, it is known that ads black holes can also admit horizons of more general

topology. following the embedding procedure described above, we demonstrate that ads4

black hole with toroidal horizon can indeed be interpreted as the near-horizon structures

of an m2-brane rotating in the extra dimensions. the four charges corresponding to the

u (1)4 cartan subgroup are just the four angular momenta. similarly, the 5-dimensional

charged black hole with toroidal horizon corresponds to a rotating d3-brane and the 7-

dimensional charged black hole with toroidal horizon to a rotating m5-brane. in each case,
the event horizon coincides with the worldvolume of the brane.3 additionally, one may use

the kaluza-klein ansatz to obtain the higher-dimensional interpretation of ads black holes

with horizons of other topologies. we conjecture that these correspond to the near-horizon

limits of rotating p-branes whose world-volumes have these topologies. (in fact the rotating
test membrane in [43] had s2 topology.)

3this is a concrete realisation of the membrane paradigm [56].

4

in this paper we also obtain the general rotating p-brane solutions in arbitrary dimen-

sions, supporeted by a single (p+2)-form charge, and discuss their sphere reductions. these

rotating p-branes are easily constructed, merely by performing standard diagonal dimen-

sional oxidations of the general rotating black holes that were constructed in [46].

2 s5 reduction of type iib supergravity

the s5 reduction [23, 24, 25] of type iib supergravity gives rise to n = 8, d = 5 gauged

supergravity, with so(6) yang-mills gauge group [21, 22]. the complete details of this

reduction, as with any sphere reduction, would be of great complexity, and in fact no

example has ever been fully worked out. for our present purposes, however, it suces

to consider the truncation of the ve-dimensional theory to n = 2 supersymmetry.

in

this truncation, which is of course a consistent one, the gauge group is reduced down to
the u (1)  u (1)  u (1) cartan subgroup of so(6). the bosonic sector of the theory
comprises these three gauge bosons, the metric, and two scalar elds. (the consistency of
the truncation to this eld content can be seen by considering the s1 reduction of ungauged

minimal non-chiral supergravity in d = 6, whose bosonic elds (g , a(2), ) reduce to give

precisely the eld content we are considering here in d = 5. after gauging, one would
obtain the u (1)3 gauged theory.)

2.1 reduction ansatze

even to construct the s5 reduction ansatz for this truncated n = 2 theory is somewhat

non-trivial, owing to the presence of the scalar elds. it is most conveniently expressed in

terms of the parameterisation of sphere metrics given in [57].

we nd that the ansatz for the reduction of the ten-dimensional metric is

ansatz for the reduction of the 5-form eld strength is f(5) = g(5) + g(5), where

equations of motion for the scalars and gauge elds in ve dimensions.

thus we have established that the reduction ansatze (2.1) and (2.8) describe the ex-
act embedding of the ve-dimensional n = 2 gauged u (1)3 supergravity into type iib

supergravity.

4we shall make some more detailed comments on certain general features of these spherical kaluza-klein

reductions in section 3, where we consider the s7 reduction of d = 11 supergravity.

the bosonic lagrangian (2.9) can be further truncated down to smaller sectors. for

example, we can consistently set 2 = 0, implying that x1 = x2 = x1/2

in this section, we show that the k = 0 three-charge ads black hole of the n = 2 gauged

supergravity in d = 5 given in (2.12) can be embedded in d = 10 as a solution that is

precisely the decoupling limit of the rotating d3-brane. the higher-dimensional solutions
corresponding to ve-dimensional ads black holes with k = 1 and k = 1 can also be easily
obtained, by substituting the ve-dimensional solutions into the s5 reduction ansatze.

generic single-charge rotating p-branes, which can be obtained by dimensional oxidation of

the generic single-charge rotating black holes constructed in [46], are presented in appendix

as is well known, the non-rotating d3-brane has a decoupling limit where the space-

time of the d3-brane becomes a product space m5  s5.
m5 is a ve-dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime. more generally, when the d3-brane is

if the d3-brane is extremal,

non-extremal, m5 is the carter-novotny-horsky metric [58], which can thus be viewed as a

non-extremal generalisation of ads5. a similar limit also exists for the rotating d3-brane,

and can be achieved by making the rescalings

in this limit, the metric (2.15) becomes

(2.21)

the metric (2.20) precisely matches the dimensional reduction ansatz (2.1), with the lower

(2.23)

to complete the story, we note that the 5-form eld strength in the decoupling limit is given
by f(5) = g(5) + g(5), where g(5) = db(4) and

b(4) = g4 r4  dt  d3x +

(2.24)

this gives precisely the eld strength in the dimensional reduction ansatz (2.8).

thus we see that the solution (2.22) is precisely the k = 0 three-charge ads black

hole given in the previous subsection, after reparameterising the angular momenta 2
i =
 sinh2 i. this shows that the embedding of the three-charge ads k = 0 black hole

in gauged n = 2 supergravity in ve dimensions gives a ten-dimensional solution that

is precisely the decoupling limit of the rotating d3-brane. single-charge ads black holes

coming from the reduction of the metric of a rotating d3-brane with one angular momentum

was obtained in [9], however without the explicit embedding of the scalar elds. the

connection between the thermodynamics of ads black holes and rotating p-branes was

discussed in [9, 10].

it is also straightforward to oxidise the k = 1 and k = 1 ads black holes back to
d = 10 type iib. the metric is the same form as (2.20) with d~y  d~y replaced by the unit
metric for s3 or h 3 respectively. the 5-form eld strength follows by substituting the

ve-dimensional elds into (2.8).

3 s7 reduction of d = 11 supergravity

3.1 reduction ansatze

the s7 reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity gives rise to so(8) gauged n = 8

supergravity in four dimensions. one may again consider a consistent truncation to n = 2,

for which the bosonic sector comprises the metric, four commuting u (1) gauge potentials,

three dilatons and three axions.
(that this is a consistent truncation can be seen by
reducing minimal non-chiral six-dimensional supergravity on t 2, for which the reduction

of (g , a(2), ) will give precisely the eld content we are considering. after gauging, this
would give the u (1)4 gauged theory. see appendix b for an extended discussion of this.)

we have not yet determined the complete reduction ansatz for the entire truncated theory

where the axions are included, but we can give the exact ansatz in the case where one

sets the axions to zero. this will not, of course, be a consistent truncation, since the u (1)
gauge elds will provide source terms of the form  f f for the axions. nevertheless,

one can use the axion-free ansatz for discussing the exact embedding of four-dimensional

solutions for which the axions are zero. the full n = 2 four-dimensional theory, including

the axions, is obtained in appendix b.

the reduction ansatz for the eleven-dimensional metric is

one might think that it would be possible to obtain the four-dimensional lagrangian

by substituting the ansatze (3.1) and (3.6) into the eleven-dimensional lagrangian. in fact

this is not the case, and one must work at the level of the eleven-dimensional equations

of motion. one way of understanding this is from the fact that the ansatz for f(4) does

not identically satisfy the bianchi identity. rather, as we have seen, it satises it modulo

the use of the four-dimensional equations of motion for the scalars and gauge elds.

in

other words, the ansatz is made on the eleven-dimensional 4-form f(4) rather than on the

fundamental potential a(3) itself. consequently, it would not be correct to insert the ansatz

for f(4) into the lagrangian.

we may further illustrate this point by showing, as an example, how the scalar potential

arises in the four-dimensional einstein equation. this comes from considering the eleven-

dimensional einstein equation,

rab  1

6if the ansatze (3.1) and (3.6) are linearised around an ads4  s7 background, they can be seen to be in

agreement with previous results that were derived at the linear level [19]. the full non-linear metric ansatz

(3.1) should be in agreement with the appropriate specialisation of the ansatz given in [59].

substituting (3.10), (3.11) and (3.12) into (3.9), we nd that all the angular dependence

coming from the i variables cancels, and that the scalar potential terms in the four-

dimensional einstein equation are given by

r  1

2 r  =  1

2 g2 v  ,

(3.13)

with v given by

v = 4xi<j

xi xj = 8(cosh 1 + cosh 2 + cosh 3) .

(3.14)

since (3.13) derives from the lagrangian r  g2 v , we see that we have precisely produced
the hoped-for potential terms of the gauged supergravity lagrangian (3.8). this sample

calculation also serves to illustrate that the angular dependence coming from the i variables

would not have cancelled if we had merely substituted the ansatze (3.1) and (3.6) into the

eleven-dimensional lagrangian. it also shows that the cancellation of the i dependence in

the higher-dimensional equations of motion depends crucially on conspiracies between the

contributions from the metric and the 4-form eld strength. this is quite dierent from the

situation in toroidal reductions, where each term in the higher-dimensional theory reduces

12

consistently by itself, without the need for any such conspiracies. note, furthermore, that

the required conspiracies needed for the success of the spherical reduction depend on the

4-form eld strength occurring with precisely the correct coecient relative to the einstein-

hilbert term. this normalisation is not a free parameter, but is governed by the strength

of the f f a term in the eleven-dimensional theory. thus ultimately the consistency of

the spherical reduction ansatz can be traced back to the supersymmetry of the eleven-

dimensional theory.

note that the lagrangian (3.8) can be further truncated, to pure einstein-maxwell with

a cosmological constant, by setting all the eld strengths equal, f i

(2) = 1

2 f(2), and setting all

the scalars to zero:

e1l4 = r  1

4 (f(2))2 + 24g2 .

(3.15)

the embedding of this theory into d = 11 supergravity was obtained in [34]. the ansatz for

the metric and eld strength for the embedding in [34] was given in terms of a decomposition
of the 7-sphere as a u (1) bundle over cp 3. this is identical, after a transformation of
coordinates, to the einstein-maxwell embedding given in [8]. in the same spirit, the s5

reduction to ve-dimensional einstein-maxwell can be described using the method presented
in [34], with s5 viewed as a u (1) bundle over cp 2. (an analogous consistent embedding

of four-dimensional einstein-yang-mills with an su (2) gauge group, and a cosmological
constant, in d = 11 supergravity was obtained in [60]. this involves a decomposition of s7
as an su (2) bundle over s4.)

we nd that its eld strength f(4) = da(3) is also of the form given in (3.6) for the dimen-

non-extremal 4-charge ads black holes into eleven-dimensional supergravity, and further-

more, that they become precisely the decoupling limit of the rotating m2-branes. it should,

of course, be emphasised that the four-dimensional ads black holes that we are considering
at this point have t 2 rather than s2 horizons, corresponding to k = 0 in (3.16) and (3.17).
it is also straightforward to oxidise the k = 1 and k = 1 ads black hole solutions back

to d = 11, by substituting the four-dimensional elds into the ansatze (3.1) and (3.6).

4 s4 reduction of d = 11 supergravity

4.1 reduction ansatze

the kaluza-klein reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on s4 gives rise to n = 4
in a similar manner to the s5 and s7

gauged so(5) supergravity in seven dimensions.

reductions that we discussed previously, we may consider an n = 2 truncation of this

seven-dimensional theory. as described in the introduction, the truncated theory comprises

n = 2 supergravity coupled to a vector multiplet, comprising the metric, 2-form potential,

four vector potentials and four scalars in total. for our present purposes, we we shall focus

on a further truncation where only the metric, two gauge potentials (which are associated
with the u (1)  u (1) cartan subgroup of so(5)) and two scalars are retained. this is not

15

in general a consistent truncation, but, as in the case of the neglect of the axions in the
s7 reduction, it is consistent for a subset of solutions where the truncated elds are not

excited by the ones that are retained. in particular, solutions of the n = 2 theory for which
f 1

we nd that we can obtain this truncated theory by making the following kaluza-klein

(2) = 0, such as the ads black holes, will also be solutions of this truncated theory.

saddle point at x1 = x2 = 21/5 [61]. note that by making use of the auxiliary variable

ads black hole in d = 7 can be reinterpreted as the decoupling limit of the rotating m2-

brane. (of course in this example, one can only discuss the embedding when the scalar

elds are included, since there is no choice of charge parameters for which the scalar elds

vanish in the seven-dimensional black holes. this contrasts with the cases of the rotating

d3-branes and m5-branes, where the special choice of setting all the charges equal allows

the discussion of a simplied ansatz where the scalars are omitted.)

6 conclusions

in this paper, we have constructed the non-linear ansatze for the spherical dimensional

reduction of type iib supergravity on s5, and eleven-dimensional supergravity on s7 and
s4, in the case where we restrict to the abelian subgroups of the full so(6), so(8) and

so(5) gauge groups. in this way, we have shown how the gauged theories in d = 5, d = 4

and d = 7 that are relevant for constructing charged ads black holes can be embedded

into type iib supergravity or eleven-dimensional supergravity.

as a matter of fact, in order to work out what the non-linear metric and eld-strength

ansatze should be, we got many hints by looking at the detailed forms of the lower-

dimensional congurations that one obtains by making the appropriate sphere compact-

ications of the near-horizon limits of the corresponding spinning d3-brane, m2-brane or

m5-brane, and comparing the results with the ads black-hole solutions in d = 5, d = 4

and d = 7. the key step in being able to extract general results for the reduction ansatze

from these specic solutions is that one must rst establish that the various components of

the higher-dimensional metrics and eld strengths can in fact be expressed in a generic way

in terms of the elds of the lower-dimensional theory, together with the coordinates of the

compactifying sphere. only by doing this can one then kick away the ladder, and extract

general results, independent of any specic solution, for how an arbitrary solution of the

lower-dimensional equations of motion can be embedded in the higher-dimensional theory.

luckily, the multi-charge ads black-hole solutions are general enough that they provided

many clues that were helpful in deducing what the full ansatze should be.

rather general, although highly implicit, results had previously been given for the metric
ansatz for the full so(8) reduction of d = 11 supergravity on s7 [35, 36]. in principle, it
should be possible to verify that the u (1)4 truncation of the general case is in agreement
with our result (3.1) for the u (1)4 gauged theory. in practice, however, the implicit nature

of the general expressions in [35, 36] makes the comparison rather dicult. the situation

regarding the 4-form eld strength is even less clear, and only results of an even more

implicit nature have been previously presented. even less has been given previously for the
other examples, namely the s5 and s4 reductions. it should be emphasised that it is the

20

handling of the scalar elds in the various ansatze that presents the major challenges in

performing spherical kaluza-klein reductions.

as far as we are aware, therefore, the results in this paper provide the rst explicit
examples of compactications of d = 11 supergravity on s4 and s7, and type iib super-
gravity on s5, in which sets of lower-dimensional massless elds that include scalars are

embedded in the reduction ansatze. importantly, we showed that the equivalence between

the corresponding gauged supergravities and the compactied higher-dimensional theory is

at the level of the equations of motion, rather than at the level of the eective lagrangian.

furthermore, the fact that one is able at all to read o sensible lower-dimensional equations

of motion depends crucially on conspiracies between the contributions of the ansatze for

the higher-dimensional metric and antisymmetric tensor. (without such conspiracies, one

would not get a clean factorisation of lower-dimensional equations of motion multiplied by

overall sphere-dependent factors.) this emphasises that non-trivial spherical reductions, in

which kaluza-klein gauge elds and scalars are retained, make sense only in the context of

certain very special higher-dimensional theories. all the known examples of such theories

are supergravities.

having found the non-linear kaluza-klein ansatze, we were able to provide an explicit

demonstration of how the multi-charge ads black holes in gauged d = 5, d = 4 and

d = 7 supergravities that have toroidal horizons are embedded in type iib supergravity or

d = 11 supergravity, and to show that the higher-dimensional solutions are precisely the

near-horizon decoupling limits of spinning d3-branes, m2-branes and m5-branes. (previous

partial results for a single-charge ads5 black hole appeared in [9], and results for the special

case of reissner-nordstrom ads5 and ads4 black holes appeared in [8].)

the results that we have obtained have also opened the door to the study of the embed-

ding into m-theory or string theory of other solutions of gauged supergravities in d = 4,

d = 5 and d = 7 in dimensions; for example ads black holes with other topologies (such

as spheres or hyperbolic spaces), strings, domain walls, etc. these solutions could in turn

provide novel information about other possible distortions of the spherical compactications

(not only those related to rotations), and thus provide new insights into strongly-coupled

gauged theories via the ads/cft correspondence.

appendices

a single-charge rotating p-branes

in this appendix, we present, for convenience, some general results for rotating p-branes in

arbitrary dimensions, supported by a single (p + 2)-form charge. this are all straightfor-

wardly obtained by diagonally oxidising the rotating black holes constructed in [46].

single-charge p-branes in supergravity theories are solutions of the lagrangian

e1l = r  1

2 ()2  1

2n! ea (f(n))2 ,

(a.1)

1) and a2 = 4  2(n  1)(d  n  1)/(d  2) [63]. in this appendix, we
where f(n) = da(n
obtain rotating p-brane solutions. the lagrangian (a.1) admits an electric (d  1)-brane
with d = n  1 or a magnetic (d  1)-brane with d = d  n  1. we shall consider only the
electric solution here, since the magnetic one can be viewed as an electric solution of the
dual (d n)-form eld strength f(d
on its world-volume spatial coordinates, to give rise to single-charge rotating black holes,

n). the rotating p-brane can be dimensionally reduced



which were obtained in [46]. conversely, it is a straightforward procedure dimensionally

to oxidise the rotating black hole solutions in [46] to give the rotating p-branes in higher

dimensions. we shall use this approach to obtain general single-charge rotating p-branes in

this appendix.

introducing a dual parameter d = d d 2 = d n 1, the dimension of the transverse
space is d + 2. it follows that the foliating spheres of the transverse space have dimension
d + 1. there are two cases arising, depending on whether d is even or odd.

case 1: d + 2 = 2n

in this case, there are n angular momenta i, with i = 1, 2, . . . , n . we nd that the

metric of the rotating (n  2)-brane solution to the equations following from (a.1) is

case 2: d + 2 = 2n + 1

here, the solution has the same form as in case 1, but with the range of the index i

extended to include 0. (note that our variable 0 is called  in [57].) however, there is

no angular momentum parameter or azimuthal coordinate associated with the extra index

value, and so 0 = 0 and 0 = 0. otherwise, all the formulae in case 1 are generalised
simply by extending the summation to span the range 0  i  n . of course h0 = 1 as a
consequence of 0 = 0.

b d = 4, n = 2 gauged supergravity

the so(8) gauged n = 8 supergravity in four dimensions was obtained in [17, 18] by

gauging an so(8) subgroup of the global e7 symmetry group of [64, 65]. to avoid some

of the complications of non-abelian gauge elds, one may consider a truncation of this

23

model to n = 2, for which the bosonic sector comprises the metric, four commuting u (1)

gauge potentials, three dilatons and three axions. in the absence of axions, this truncation

was obtained in [7] by working in the symmetric gauge for the 56-bein and incorporating

three real scalars. as was noted, there is a straightforward generalization of the scalar

ansatz to allow for complex scalars. taking into account the e7 self-duality condition

ijkl



ijkl



= ijkl = 1
= ijkl = 2[(1)(12) +(2)(13) +(3)(14) +

(24) +

(1)

(2)

(23)]ijkl, (b.1)

where we follow the notation and conventions of [7] (including the denition of so(8)

index pairs). note that the three complex scalars may be parameterised in terms of their
magnitudes and phases as (i) = (i)ei(i)

.

here, we shall consider the full n = 2 truncation, where the three axions are included

as well as the other elds. in fact the structure of the potential is little changed. we nd

that the lagrangian including the axions may be written in the form

e1l4 = r  1

2xi (cid:16)((i))2 + sinh2 (i)((i))2(cid:17)  1

(b.2)

where the potential is given simply by

v = 8(cosh (1) + cosh (2) + cosh (3)) .

(b.3)

the complex symmetric scalar matrix m is quite complicated, and incorporates all three
complex scalars () in a symmetric manner; this is presented below.

in terms of the n = 2 truncation, the three complex scalars each parameterise an

sl(2; r)/so(2) coset. this may be made explicit by performing the change of variables
((i), (i))  (i, i):

cosh (i) = cosh i + 1
cos (i) sinh (i) = sinh i  1
sin (i) sinh (i) = i ei .

while this n = 2 truncation of the n = 8 theory essentially treats all four u (1) gauge

elds equally, it was noted that one can make contact with the theory obtained by reduction
of a closed string on t 2 through dualisation of two of the gauge elds. to be specic, we
dualise f (2)
 , which singles out the dilaton-axion pair s = 2 + ie2. after an
additional eld redenition s  1/s, we obtain the bosonic lagrangian

where mi = v t

(b.15)

(b.16)

we see that, save for the potential, the dualise lagrangian is indeed of the form obtained

from t 2 compactication from six dimensions.

in this case, two of the sl(2; r)s now

correspond to t -dualities while the third corresponds to s-duality. note that the initial

choice of which two eld strengths to dualise has determined which of the three dilaton-axion

pairs (i, i) is to be identied with the strong-weak coupling sl(2; r).

having shown that the bosonic lagrangian is considerably simplied by dualising to the
eld variables that arise in the t 2 reduction, we may re-express the result (b.12) in the
more explicit notation of [39, 66]. thus the bosonic sector of the gauged u (1)4 theory may

be written as

the inclusion of the potential term in the gauged supergravity theory breaks all three

sl(2; r) symmetries to o(2), acting as   (a + b)/(c + d) where

  a b

(b.19)

in terms of the original (, ) scalar variables in (b.2), this o(2) subgroup corresponds to
   + . the o(2) symmetry is, however, sucient for generating dyonic solutions.
nevertheless, we note that the fermionic sector and in particular the supersymmetry trans-

formations are not invariant under this symmetry of the bosonic sector. one manifestation

26

of this particular situation is the fact that magnetic black holes of this theory are not su-

persymmetric, even though they may be extremal. furthermore, in a related note, while

it is clear that the dualisation procedure performed above runs into diculty in the full

n = 8 theory with non-abelian so(8) gauging, the fermionic sector does not admit such a

straightforward dualisation, even in the n = 2 abelian truncation. this is easily seen by

the fact that the gravitini are necessarily charged under the gauge elds and hence couple

to the bare gauge potentials themselves.

c calculation of the ricci tensor for the reduction ansatze

many of the calculations involved in the spherical reduction ansatze in this paper are quite

involved, and some of them are more conveniently performed by computer. however, some

of them are quite tractable by hand calculation. here, we present some useful results

for some of the curvature calculations for the metric ansatz, which can be presented in a

relatively compact form if further specialisations are made, as discussed below.

the general kaluza-klein ansatz for odd sphere s2k1 reductions of the d-dimensional

metric may be expressed in the form

d = ea ds2

where we have set the radius of s2k1 to unity. there are k  1 scalar degrees of freedom
parameterised by the k quantities xi satisfying the constraint qk
i=1 xi = 1. this form of
the line element encompasses both the s5 reduction of type iib supergravity and the s7
reduction of eleven dimensional supergravity. as dened previously, e = pk

i=1 2
in the absence of the gauge elds, this metric has a block diagonal form, with the blocks
corresponding to the d-dimensional spacetime, the k  1 direction cosines i and the k
azimuthal rotation angles i. the main diculty in computing the curvature of (c.1) lies

in the fact that the is are constrained. nevertheless, we may perform an asymmetric
choice of using the rst k  1 of them as actual coordinates, while expressing k as the
constrained quantity k = (1 pk1
since numerous terms are involved in the computation, it is imperative to clarify our
notation. we denote the lower-dimensional spacetime indices by , , . . . = 0, 1, . . . , d  1,
the direction cosine indices by , , , . . . = 1, 2, . . . , k  1 and the azimuthal indices by
