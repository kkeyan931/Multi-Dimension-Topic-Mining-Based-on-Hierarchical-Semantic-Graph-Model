abstract

a non-trivial supergeneralization of the kerr-newman solu-
tion is considered as representing a combined model of the kerr-
newman spinning particle and superparticle.

we show that the old problem of obtaining non-trivial super
black hole solutions can be resolved in supergravity broken by
goldstone fermion. non-linear realization of broken n=2 super-
symmetry specic for the kerr geometry is considered and some
examples of the super-kerr geometries generated by goldstone
fermion are analyzed. the resulting geometries acquire torsion,
rarita-schwinger eld and extra wave contributions to metric and
electromagnetic eld caused by grassmann variables.

one family of the self-consistent superkerrnewman solu-
tions to broken n=2 supergravity is selected, and peculiarities
of these solutions are discussed. in particular, the appearance of
extra axial singular line and traveling waves concentrated near
axial and ring-like singularities.

1 introduction

since 1968 it has been mentioned that the kerr-newman solution possesses
some remarkable properties which allow to consider it as a model of spinning
particle [1, 2, 3, 4]. some string-like structures were obtained in kerr geome-
try. the rst one is connected with a singular ring of the kerr solution [2, 5],
two others are linked with a complex representation of kerr geometry [6] in
which the kerr-newman solution is considered as a retarded-time eld gen-
erated by a complex source propagating along a complex world line [4]. the
point of view that some of black holes can be treated as elementary particles
was also suggested by superstring theory [7, 8, 9, 4, 5]. in particular, sen
[8] has obtained a generalization of the kerr solution to low energy string
theory, and it was shown [9] that near the kerr singular ring the kerr-sen
solution acquires a metric similar to the eld around a heterotic string.

however, description of spinning particle based only on the bosonic elds
cannot be complete, and involving fermionic degrees of freedom is required.
the most natural way to involve fermions is to treat corresponding super
black holes in supergravity.
in previous papers [10, 11] we considered a
method of supergeneralization of the kerr-newman geometry leading to a
combined model of the kerr spinning particle and superparticle .
it was
mentioned that this method leads to the broken or non-linear realization of
supersymmetry.

in the present paper we show that the breaking of supersymmetry caused
by goldstone fermion allows to resolve the old problem of non-triviality of
the super black holes solutions [14, 15, 16, 17]. using deser-zumino model of
broken n=1 supergravity [12] generalized to the n=2 supergravity described
by ferrara and nieuwenhuizen [13], we analyze some non-trivial supergener-
alizations of the kerr-newman geometry and show the appearance of torsion
and traveling waves.

we select one self-consistent class of the super-kerr-newman solutions
to n=2 supergravity with supersymmetry broken by goldstone fermion and
discuss peculiarities of these solutions. in particular, the appearance of extra
axial singular line and traveling waves concentrated near the axial and
ring-like singularities.

2 non-trivial super-solutions from trivial ones

the problem of non-trivial supergravity solutions is connected with the fact
that any solution of einstein gravity is indeed a trivial solution of super-
gravity eld equations with a zero spin-3/2 eld [14, 15, 16, 17]. by using
a supergauge freedom of supergravity (supertranslations) one can turn the
gravity solutions into a form containing spin-3/2 eld. however, since this
eld can be gauged away by the reverse transformation, such supersolutions
are indeed trivial. there existed even an opinion that all the super black
hole solutions are trivial. however, some examples of the non-trivial super
black hole solutions were given by aichelburg and guven [18, 19], and also
in two dimensional dilaton supergravity by knutt-wehau and mann [20].

in previous papers [10, 11] we showed that non-trivial examples of the
super-kerr geometry can be obtained by a trivial supershift of the kerr so-
lution taking into account some non-linear b-slice constraints. indeed, the
complex structure of the kerr geometry prompts how to avoid this triviality
problem.

the kerr-schild form of the kerr geometry [21]

gik = ik + 2hkikk

(1)

allows to give a complex representation of the kerr solution as a geometry
generated by a complex source propagating along a complex world line xi
0( )
in auxiliary minkowski space  = diag(, + + +). this representation shows
that from complex point of view the schwarzschild and kerr geometries are
equivalent and connected by a trivial complex shift.

the non-trivial twisting structure of the kerr geometry arises as a result
of the shifted real slice of the complex retarded-time construction [6, 4]. if
the real slice is passing via center of the solution x0 there appears a usual
spherical symmetry of the schwarzschild geometry. the specic twisting
structure results from the complex shift of the real slice regarding the source.
similarly, it is possible to turn a trivial super black hole solution into a

non-trivial if one nds an analogue to the real slice in superspace.

the trivial supershift can be represented as a replacement of the complex

world line by a superworldline

0( ) = xi

0( )  ii  + ii ,

(2)

3

parametrized by grassmann coordinates ,
dinate replacement in the kerr solution

, or as a corresponding coor-

xi = xi + ii   ii ;

 =  + ,

 =  + ,

(3)

assuming that coordinates xi before the supershift are the usual c-number
coordinates one sees that coordinates acquire nilpotent grassmann contribu-
tions after supertranslations. therefore, there appears a natural splitting
of the space-time coordinates on the c-number body-part and a nilpotent
part - the so called soul. the body subspace of superspace, or b-slice, is
a submanifold where the nilpotent part is equal to zero, and it is a natural
analogue to the real slice in complex case.

it has been shown in [10, 11] that reproducing the real slice procedure
of the kerr geometry in superspace we have to consider super light cone
constraints 2

s2 = [xi  x0i( )][xi  x i

0( )] = 0,

and b-slice, where coordinates xi do not contain nilpotent contributions. se-
lecting the body and nilpotent parts of this equation we obtain three equa-
tions. the rst one is the real slice condition of the complex kerr geometry
claiming that complex light cones, described by set

x = x0( ) +  ,

(5)

can reach the real slice. here  and  are the commuting two-component
spinors. on the real slice eld (x) determines the principal null congruence
of the kerr geometry (1)

(4)

(6)

(7)

(8)

ki(x) = p 1i .

the nilpotent part of (4) yields two b-slice conditions
0( )](i   i ) = 0;
(    )2 = 0.

[xi  xi

2these constraints are similar to the complex light cone constraints of the standard
kerr geometry connected with a retarded-time construction. the physical sence of these
constraints is existence of the real slice for the light cones placed at the points of complex
world line xi
0( ). similarly, super light cone constraints demand existence of the body-slice
for the super light cones placed at the points of the super world line (2).

4

equation (7) may be rewritten using (5) in the form

(i      i   )i

 



 = 0

which yields

 = 0,

 = 0,

(9)

(10)

which in turn is a condition of proportionality of the commuting spinors
(x) and anticommuting spinors  and , this condition providing the left
null superplanes of the supercones to reach b-slice.

finally, by introducing the kerr projective spinor coordinate y (x) we

have  2 = y (x),

 1 = 1, and we obtain

  =  
  =  

 1
y (x) 1 ! ,
 1
y (x) 1 ! .

(11)

(12)

it also leads to   =   = 0, and equation (8) is satised automatically.
thus, as a consequence of the b-slice and superlightcone constraints we
 = (x). the orig-
obtain a non-linear submanifold of superspace  = (x),
inal four-dimensional supersymmetry is broken, and the initial supergauge
freedom which allowed to turn the super geometry into trivial one is lost.
nevertheless, there is a residual supersymmetry based on free grassmann
parameters 1,

1.

it was mentioned that the above b-slice constraints yield in fact the
non-linear realization of broken supersymmetry introduced by volkov and
akulov [22, 23] and considered in n=1 supergravity by deser and zumino
[12]. in terminology of broken supersymmetry the grassmann parameters
 (x) represent some fermion goldstone eld on space-time which
 (x),
has to be eaten by spin-3/2 rarita-schwinger eld. as a result supergauge
will be xed.

in this paper we consider the application of this approach to obtaining the
superversions of the kerr-newman solution to n=2 supergravity formulated
in [13].

3 broken supersymmetry in n=1 supergrav-

ity

here we use spinor notations of the book [23]. the indices i, j, k, l... are
related to coordinate, and a, b, c, d... are reserved for tetrad.

the volkov-akulov model of non-linear realization of supersymmetry
[22, 23] is based on selecting a submanifold of superspace setting the cor-
respondence of the grassmann coordinates 3

  !
 =   

(13)

to a goldstone eld (x) which is a majorana fermion. this yields the
submanifold (x) = b(x) which is non-linear in general case. the non-
linear residual supertransformations are

 = b1 + ib(i)i(x),

(14)

and contain inhomogeneous term b1 =   

  !.

considered by deser and zumino case of broken n=1 supergravity is
based on this model [12], and it is proposed that  admits local transforma-
tions (x).

the lagrangian is given by 4

l = (i/2)d  (i/2b)ii + lsg,

where the supergravity lagrangian is

and

lsg = er/2k2  i/2ijkl i5jdkl,

di = i

ab =

[a, b].

(15)

(16)

(17)

3 further we use the dirac four-component spinor notations.
4we have omitted here cosmological term since here we shall consider only the region

of massless elds.

6

the lagrangian is invariant under the above non-linear supertransforma-
tions, and tetrad ea and rarita-schwinger elds i are transformed as follows

 = b1 + ib(i)i,

i = ikai,
ea
i = 2/kdi.

(18)

(19)

(20)

it is assumed that this construction is similar to the higgs mechanism
of the usual gauge theories. the goldstone fermion (x) can be eaten by
appropriate local transformation (x) with a corresponding redenition of the
tetrad and spin-3/2 eld. it means that starting from the gravity solution
with zero spin-3/2 eld and some goldstone fermion eld  one can obtain
in such a way a non-trivial supergravity solution with non-linear realization
of broken supersymmetry.

there are two obstacles for indirect application of this scheme to the
kerr-newman case. first one is the electromagnetic charge which demands
to change the expression for supercovariant derivative that leads to non-
majorana values for spin-3/2 eld. the second one is the complex character
of supertranslations in the kerr case that also yields the non-majorana su-
pershifts. thus, this scheme has to be extended to n=2 supergravity.

4 broken supersymmetry in n=2 supergrav-

ity

the consistent n=2 supergravity described by ferrara and nieuwenhuizen
[13] is based on the complex (non-majorana) supergauge eld  = (1 +
i2)/2 and contains a complex spin-3/2 eld  = ( + i)/2 and the
vector potential of electromagnetic eld ai.

the expression for supercovariant derivative (see appendix b) is extended
by electromagnetic contribution fab and torsion terms dn i = (k2/2)abkiab,
(21)

di = di + dn i  (ik/22)fababi.

the action is invariant under the following complex local supersymmetry
transformations

ea

i = k(ai  ia),

7

(22)

i = (2/k) di,

ai = i2(i  i).

(23)

(24)

the expression (18) can be extended on the complex non-majorana spinors

 = b1 + ib(i)i.

(25)

now we have to use the above considered complex supershift and superlight-
cone constraints of the kerr geometry (11, 12) in n=2 supergravity. one
should note, that the above superlightcone constraints restrict values of su-
pershift parameters , leaving the values of  free, which leads in general case
to a non-majorana spinor

 =   
  !

(26)

corresponding to a complex supershift. further, we should note that su-
percovariant derivative contains the nonlinear in  terms from torsion dn ,
which hinders the indirect use of nite supertranslations. at the other hand
the kerr constraints on , (12), select a submanifold displaying a remarkable
nilpotency  2 = 0. it means, that the values of  on this submanifold lie in
a degenerate subalgebra of the grassmann algebra [15, 24]. 5

to avoid the non-linear terms from torsion we will extend this property

on the four-component spinor , and will restrict supershift by the form

where

 = 21/2  s

s  ! ,

s2 = s2 = 0;

ss + ss = 0.

(27)

(28)

this form possesses the nilpotency 2 = 0 that leads to cancelling the non-
linear term dn , and gives rise to validity (22), (23), (24) under nite super-
translations. the formulated in n=1 case problem of the absorption of the

5it means that the complex expansion  = (1)

pqrspsqsr...., where spsq +
sqsp = 0, contains there only the rst non-zero term s2 = s2 = 0;
ss + ss = 0. this
degeneracy take place only on the considered subspace of supershifts, however, even in a
very narrow neighborhood of this subspace the full algebra has to be taken into account. in
particular, by application spinor supercovariant derivatives when the grassmann variables
have to be considered as independent.

goldstone fermion  is reduced to a choice of supergauge eld

(x) = b(x),

that leads to satisfying (25) and yields  =  +   0, if we assume that 
has corresponding nilpotency.
below we present few examples of supershift functions and will see that
the most interesting case is when the goldstone fermion  satises the mass-
less dirac equation.

5 examples of n=2 super-geometries

in this section we consider dierent variants of the goldstone fermion satis-
fying the constraints (12) and describe the resulting super-geometries. it is
convenient to perform all calculations in the local lorentz frame of the kerr
geometry where -matrices take the form [16, 19, 26]

will be called as aligned to e3 if e3
d = 0. similarly, spinor (4) is aligned to e4 if e4
i i(4) = 0, which yields
b = c = 0. therefore, any four component spinor can be split on the
sum of two aligned spinors  = (3) + (4). physically, the e3 (e4) aligned
solution describes the waves in the e3 (e4) null direction.
in many cases
(especially massless) solutions of these aligned parts are independent. in the

algebraically special kerr-newman geometry all the tensor elds are aligned
to the principal null direction e3. the supershift constraints (12) represent
in fact a condition for the two-component spinor  to be aligned to e3. in
the local lorentz frame it takes the form  2 = 0, the second component
 1 = c is free. therefore, the general form of supershift satisfying the kerrs
superconstraints and nilpotency condition will be

(39)

the function y (x) is the main function determining the principal null con-
gruence (6) and the kerr tetrad. it can be expressed as a projective spinor
coordinate y = 0/ 1 6, and satises the equation dy = z[e1  (p y /p )e3],
where p = 21/2(1 + y y ) for the stationary kerr-newman background. the
corresponding kerr tetrad ea is given in the appendix c. the resulting nilpo-
tent contribution to tetrad contains two terms, contributions from metric and
from electromagnetic eld ea = gea + f ea. the metric part will be

ge1 = ss2[( cc  bb)dy  adb + bd a + aag + ab(h + h)],
ge2 =  e1,
ge3 = ss2[( ab)d y  a bdy + ad a  ada + a a( h  h)],
ge4 = ss2[ cdc  cd c + bdb  bd b +
ab g  a bg + (b b  c c)( h  h)].

(40)

electromagnetic contribution to tetrad is

f e1 = ikss/2[e1(c a n  can)  c a se3],
f e2 = f
f e3 = iksse3(c a n + can)/2,
f e4 = ikss(ne4 + se1)(c a + ca)/2.

nilpotent contribution to vector potential (24) also contains two terms a =

and

f a = ss/2{e1[sa a + ( n  n)a b] + e2[ sa a  ( n  n) ab] +
e3[(b b + c c)(n + n )  a b s  abs] + e4a a(n + n )}.

6this function is determined by the kerr theorem [6, 21]. a xation of y selects the

null planes in cm 4 and null rays of the principal null congruence.

11

in these expressions we have the free spinor components

 =   a(x)

b(x) ! ,

(44)

determining the supershift. now we consider some particular cases leading
to simplication of general expressions.

5.1 case i
the simplest spinor shift a(x) 6= 0, b = 0, considered in the basis having
the -matrices adapted to the auxiliary minkowski space ik. the peculiarity
of this shift is that while transformed to the aligned basis 7 this spinor takes
the same simple form that allows to simplify expressions

 =   a(x)

0 ! ,

(45)

we will also assume that c = 1, and obtain for g contribution to tetrad

ge1 = ss2[dy + aag],
ge2 =  e1,
ge3 = ss2[ad a  ada + a a( h  h)],
ge4 = ss2( h  h),

and f contribution

f e1 = ikss/2[e1( a n  an)  a se3],
f e2 = f
f e3 = iksse3( a n + an)/2,
f e4 = ikss(ne4 + se1)( a + a)/2.

f a = ss/2[(e1 + e2)a a + (e3 + e4a a)(n + n)].

(49)

one can see that the wave oscillations of the shift, a = eipixi
can lead to the
wave oscillations of the terms f ea in tetrad and the term ga in the vector
potential. since in the kerr-newman geometry function n has the behavior
n  z 2, the tetrad oscillations are growing near the kerr singular ring and
take the form of waves travelling along the singularity. however, in this case
we do not have clear proposals concerning mechanisms or the possible origin
of such oscillations in supershift. some suggestion to this case follows from
observation that such oscillating spinor  resembles oscillating solutions of
the dirac equation.

5.2 case ii
the spinor shift has parameters a = 0, b 6= 0, considered in the basis
where -matrices are adapted to the auxiliary minkowski space ik. being
transformed to the aligned basis this spinor takes the form a = b y ; b 6= 0.
this case does not lead to essential simplications in respect to the general
case, and we will not write down the expressions for this case, but we should
note that appearance of traveling waves for oscillating b can be observed in
this case, too.

5.3 case iii
the case of supershifts aligned to e3: a = 0; b 6= 0, considered in the aligned
e3 basis. 8 this case yields maximal simplications of the expressions and is
motivated by super-qed model of broken supersymmetry for the region of
matter elds. besides, as we shall see it leads to a family of self-consistent
super-kerr-newman solutions.

there is no electromagnetic contributions to tetrad in this case and we

have

e1 = ss2(c c  b b)dy,
e2 =  e1,
e3 = 0,

(50)

8if -matrices were adapted to auxiliary minkowski frame this shift is given by param-

eters a =  y ; b = 1. see matrices of transformation in appendix d.

13

e4 = ss2[(c c  b b)h( z  z)e3 + cdc  cd c + bdb  bd b].

the contribution to the kerr-newman vector potential will be

ga = i(ss22/k)[ bcdy  b cd y ],
f a = ss/2e3[(b b + c c)(n + n )].

(52)
the case c = b could be called pseudo-majorana. in this case there are
no nilpotent contributions to tetrad at all, ea = 0, and metric has pure
bosonic form similar to the case of extreme black holes without an angu-
lar momentum. however, the kerr-newman vector potential has nilpotent
contributions, and moreover, it can have traveling waves from the term

(51)

ga = i(ss22/k)( b2dy  b2d y ).

(53)

in the case of independent b and c there also appears tetrad traveling waves.
in general case there is a non-zero torsion in the super-kerr geometry

torsion. 9

6 self-consistent super-kerr-newman solutions

to broken n=2 supergravity

the generalized to n=2 supergravity deser-zumino lagrangian (15),(16)
takes the form

l = (i/2)[ d  d]  (i/2b)[ii  ii] + l2sg,

where the n=2 supergravity lagrangian is

l2sg = er/2k2  1/4fijf ij  iijkl i5j dkl.

(57)

(58)

it follows from (57) that the self-consistent solutions to broken n=2 super-
gravity has to take into account the energy-momentum tensor of the grass-
mann elds.
in particular, when considering the initiate trivial solutions
in the super-gauge with zero raritaschwinger eld, one can use this la-
grangian with  = 0 that yields the einsteinmaxwelldirac system of equa-
tions. we note that the energy-momentum tensor of the goldstone eld 
acts here as fermionic matter. however, when using the exact kerr-newman
solution as trivial one to perform the super-gauge with absorption of the
goldstone fermion, we do not take into account the energy-momentum ten-
sor of the goldstone eld. therefore, in general case, the considered above
super-geometries cannot be treated as self-consistent. however, one exclusive
case can be selected when the self-consistency is guaranteed. it takes place
for the ghost goldstone eld possessing the zero energy-momentum tensor.
in this case, starting from the lagrangian with  = 0, we have in fact
the einstein-maxwell system of equation leading to the exact kerr-newman

15

solution and the dirac equation ( on the kerr-newman background ) for the
goldstone fermion .

this solution can be considered as an exact super-solution to n=2 super-
gravity coupled to goldstone eld. then, absorption of the goldstone eld by
the complex rarita-schwinger eld  turns this solution into self-consistent
solution with broken n=2 supersymmetry.

in the appendix b we have given the solutions of the massless dirac
equation on the kerr-newman background in the aligned to e3 case (case
iii). the corresponding functions b and c have the form

b = zfb( y ,  )/p,

c = zfc(y,  )/p,

(59)

where fb and fc are arbitrary analytic functions of the complex angular
variable

and the retarded-time

y = ei tan(/2),

 = t  r  ia cos 

(60)

(61)

satises the relations ,2 = ,4 = 0, and y,2 = y,4 = 0.

the energy-momentum tensor of the goldstone eld  can be expressed

via the grassmann contributions to tetrad (51) as follows

tik = i/2e(iaea
k).

(62)

one sees that the energy-momentum tensor of the goldstone eld  with
c = b cancels, tik = 0, and the eld takes the ghost character. as it was
mentioned earlier, in this case torsion and grassmann contributions to tetrad
are absent, and metric takes the exact kerr-newman form.

the main features of the resulting super-kerr-newman solutions are the
extra wave elds on the bosonic kerr-newman background: the complex
rarita-schwinger eld i and the nilpotent contributions to electromagnetic
eld given by the expressions (52) and (53).

one should note that the expressions for b and c are singular on the
kerr singular ring, z 1  p 1(r + ia cos ) = 0, and contain traveling waves
if there is an oscillating dependence on complex time parameter  . indeed,
near the kerr singular ring tan   1, and angular dependence of these
solutions on  is determined by the degree of function y = ei tan(/2). one
sees that any non-trivial analytic dependence on y will lead to a singularity

16

in . thus, besides the kerr singular ring the solutions contain an extra
axial singularity which is coupled topologically with singular ring threading
it. the singular rarita-schwinger hair was mentioned earlier by aichelburg
and guven [19, 25] as an obstacle to form a super black hole in the case of
the kerr geometry. however, when considering this solution as a model of
spinning particle, we have to treat a region of parameters a  m leading to
a naked disk-like super-source [1, 3, 10] without horizons that allows to avoid
the objections related to rotating black holes. 10. however, even in the case
of black hole, one can assume that this axial singularity will not hinder to
form horizon since it is build of the ghost elds.

one should also note that this axial singularity in some solutions can
change the position in time scanning the space-time. one simple example of
such function is

c = (z/p )[f1( )  y f2( )]1,

where the position of the axial singularity is determined by the root of
equation y = f1/f2 depending on the retarded-time parameter  . 11
let us consider elementary fermionic wave excitations in the form

c = b = z/p y nei = 1/(r + ia cos ) tann(/2).

taking into account the coordinate relation of the kerr geometry

x + iy = (r + ia)ei sin ,

z = r cos ,

(63)

(64)

one sees that near the kerr singular ring (where r  0,
sin   1 ) at the
point  = 0, singularity is directed along the x-axis. one can introduce the
local coordinates z = z and y = y  a on the plane ortogonal to direction of
singularity. then, near the singularity r  q2a(y + iz), and (63) takes the
form

ei(n+t),

(65)

q2a(y + iz)

that describes a traveling wave along the ring-like singularity parametrized by
. the rst factor shows that this singularity is a branch line corresponding

10corresponding fermionic singular solutions were also considered in [26]
11topological coupling of the axial singularity with the kerr singular ring provides
its guiding role for the ring that allows to consider a speculation that this couple of
singularities could play the role of a topological wave-pilot construction in the spirit of the
old de broglie ideas.

to the known twofoldedness of the kerr geometry. because of that parameter
n can take both integer and half-integer values. the potential (53) takes near
singular ring the form

ga  (ss/k){[a(y + iz)]3/2ei(2n+2t)(dy + idz) + c.c.term}.

(66)

the obtained from potential (53) electromagnetic eld is
f = i(ss25/2/k){c 2[r1dy  dt + r1(r1  i)e1  e3]  c.c.term}. (67)
the proportional to e1  e3 term represents the null electromagnetic eld
propagating along principal null direction e3. near the kerr singular ring
this congruence is tangent to ring leading to traveling waves propagating
along the ring.

the axial singularity coincides with z-axis and can be placed either at
 = 0 (y = 0) or at  =  (y = ). it is a half-innite line threading
the kerr singular ring and passing to negative sheet of the kerr geometry.
its position and character depend on the values of n. by introducing the
distance from axial singularity  = x2 + y2, one can describe its behavior
in the asymptotic region of large r by the following expressions:

- if   0 then

- if    then

ga  2nr32n(dx + idy),
f a  2nr42n(dz + dt),
ga  2n2r2n1(dx  idy),
f a  2n2r2n2(dz  dt).

one sees that this singularity can be increasing or decreasing function of
distance r. for some n (for example n=1/2,-3/2) dependence on r can dis-
appear. the solutions with increasing and even singularities cannot be
stable. in the cases n = 0 and n = 1 singularity represents a decreasing
half-innite line like the string of the dirac monopole. the case n = 1/2
is exclusive: there are two decreasing singularities which are situated sym-
metrically at  = 0 and  = . the space part of the null vector e3 is tangent
to axial singularity, and electromagnetic eld (67) grows near this singularity
and contains in asymptotic region the leading term in the form of the null
traveling wave

f  (ss25/2/k)[c 2r1e1  e3 + c.c.term].

7 conclusion

we have shown that the problem of obtaining non-trivial super black hole
solutions can be resolved in supergravity broken by goldstone fermion. in
case of the kerr geometry it leads to a specic non-linear realization of su-
persymmetry which has to be adjusted with complex structure of the kerr
geometry.

we considered three families of the rotating and charged super black hole
geometries representing supergeneralizations of the kerr-newman geometry
generated by goldstone fermions of various form. when supersymmetry is
broken, the goldstone fermion disappears and these super-geometries can
acquire torsion and traveling waves of the rarita-schwinger and electromag-
netic elds.

among these geometries we have selected one exclusive family of the ex-
act super-kerr-newman solutions to n=2 supergravity broken by goldstone
fermion aligned to principal null congruence of the kerr geometry.

peculiarities of these solutions were analyzed, in particular, the ghost
character of goldstone eld, absence of torsion, the appearance of an extra
axial singular line which is coupled topologically to the kerr singular ring,
and traveling waves of the null electromagnetic eld concentrated near the
axial and ring-like singularities.

the obtained exact solutions are based on the massless goldstone eld.
at present stage of investigation our knowledge regarding the origin of the
goldstone fermion is very incompleted. analyzing the wess-zumino model
of super-qed [23] with spontaneously broken supersymmetry one can see
that it leads to massless goldstone fermions, at least in the region that is
out of core. it takes the place if we are interested mainly in the stationary
black hole solutions describing the region of massless elds.

however, as it was mentioned in [10, 11], for the known parameters of
spinning particles the angular momentum is very high, regarding the mass
parameter. in this case the black hole horizons disappear and a hard core
region, representing a superconducting disk-like source, has to be taken into
account. treatment of this region is extremely important and complicated
problem, however, it is beyond of the frame of this paper. we should only
note that investigations of such super-sources should be connected apparently
with seiberg-witten theory [28] and with some other interesting models of
broken supersymmetry together with gauge symmetry breaking [29, 30, 31,

19

appendix a. some relations of dks-formalism
[21]

the rotation coecients can be obtained from the following independent
forms

42 = ze1  y,3 e3;
12 + 34 = [h,4 +( z  z)h]e3;
31 = hze2 + (h,1 h y ,3 )e3;

(69)

taking into account property of skew-symmetry ab = ba and relations to
the complex conjugate forms, for example: 12 = 21; 42 = 41; 32 = 31.

basic relations:

y = ei tan

p = 21/2(1 + y y );
z,4 = z 2;
y,1 = z;
y,3 = zp y /p = z z 1 zp,2 /p.

z,4 =  z 2;
y,2 = y,4 = 0;

z,2 = (z  z)y,3 ;

we should note that in denitions of dks-paper the in-going congru-
ence is used leading to the advanced time coordinate  = adv = t + radv =
t + r + ia cos .12 in this case the out-congruence takes place on the neg-
ative sheet of metric where r  0. using the redenition r  r one can
interchange the positive and negative sheets of the kerr geometry that
yields the retarded time ret = t  rret = t  r  ia cos  for positive values
of r. since this redenition can be performed in the nal expressions we
retain the dks-notations in this paper for the sake of convenience with the
exceptions of the expressions for  when we would like to underline that it is
the retarded-time coordinate.

appendix b. aligned solutions of the dirac
equation

the dirac spinor is represented in general form

d =

.

(84)

12the sign of  in the expresssion (7.9c) of dks is apparently wrong.

21

the supercovariant derivative in complex n=2 case has the form

di = di + dn i  (ik/22)fababi.

(85)

the metric part of the supercovariant derivative is

di = i  1
for the ricci rotation coecients we use notations of dks-paper [21]

iab = abi, see appendix a.

bcbcd = 1212d + 3131d + 4141d

the dirac equation i did = 0.
0, has the form

a special class of e3-aligned solutions satisfying the constraint ie3

i d =

d = 


0
b
c
0




.

(87)

for the e3-aligned solutions of the dirac equation the kerr-newman electro-
magnetic eld drops out. in the nilpotent case (32) the nonlinear term drops
out too. the spinor-valued 1-form expression dd takes the form

dd = 


b( ze2 + y ,3 e3)

db + b[h,4 +(z  z)h/2]e3
dc + c[h,4 (z  z)h/2]e3

c(ze1 + y,3 e3)




.

(88)

as a result, the dirac equation adad = 0 yields the four equations:

c,4 +zc = 0;

c,2 cy,3 = 0,

and

b,4 + zb = 0;

b,1 b y ,3 = 0.

(89)

(90)

these equations can be easily solved by using the known basis relations of
the kerr-schild formalism (see appendix a).

first equation (89) gives c = zc0 where c0,4 = 0. then, substituting
c and into second equation we obtain c = f z/p , where f must satisfy the

22

conditions f,2 = f,4 = 0. therefore, f must be a function taking constant
values on the null planes spanned by vectors e1 and e3. these null planes
are left null planes of a foliation of space-time into complex null cones.
in another terminology they represent a geometrical image of twistors and
can be parametrized by twistor coordinates. all the twistor coordinates 
and  = xii satisfy the relations (...),2 = (...),4 = 0, see [6]. coordinate
y is in fact one of the (projective) twistor coordinates. for our problem it
will be convenient to use a retarded time coordinate  . the retarded time
coordinate to a point x is dened by a point of intersection of the light cone
emanated from x with the world-line of source.

the light cone is split on the left and right null planes, therefore, the
retarded time parameter takes constant values on the left null planes of the
cone that leads to the relations ,2 = ,4 = 0. 13 for the kerr geometry one
can use a known complex interpretation containing a complex world line for
the source. 14 in the rest frame the complex light cone equation (t  )2 = r2
can be split with selection of the retarded fold r = t  . here t is a real time
coordinate, and r = r + ia cos  = p/z is a complex radial distance from the
real point x to a point of source at the complex world line. it yields  = t r.
therefore, the function f can be an arbitrary analytic function of complex
coordinates y and  , and we have solution c = f (y,  )z/p . for function b
one can obtain similarly b = f ( y ,  ) z/p , where coordinates y and  satisfy
the relations (...),1 = (...),4 = 0 , and are constant on the right null planes
of the light cone foliation.

appendix c. the kerr tetrad and some useful
matrix expressions

the kerr tetrad ea is determined by function y (x):

e1 = d  y dv,
e3 = du + y d + y d  y y dv,
e4 = dv + he3,

e2 = d  y dv,

(91)

13details of this construction can be found in [6, 4].
14one should note that in the case of the complex world line the left and right roots
for the retarded time  are dierent, and right root satises the relations ,1 = ,4 = 0.
