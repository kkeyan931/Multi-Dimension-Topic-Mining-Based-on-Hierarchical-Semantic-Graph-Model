1 introduction

one of the most fascinating results obtained during the course of investigating string dualities is the
existence of new interacting theories in six dimensions. these theories possess no dynamical gravity;
nevertheless they exhibit many properties of string theory. such theories are obtained by considering a
number of coincident vebranes and taking the limit of decoupling the bulk gravity.

an example of such a theory is the (2, 0) superconformal theory obtained in the decoupling limit of
m-theory vebranes. for several coincident branes, the theory is an interacting conformal eld theory
about which rather little is known. however, in the large n limit there is a gravitational description
through the ads/cf t correspondence, and one nds that the theory contains n 3 degrees of freedom.
(this can be obtained either by entropy considerations [1][2] or by calculating the conformal anomaly
of the partition function[3]). it follows that the non-abelian system cannot have a conventional gauge
theory description since n 3  dim gl(n ). the conformal anomaly of observables associated with closed
two-dimensional submanifolds have also been calculated [4] in the large n limit.

by contrast, the world-volume theory on a single m -theory vebrane is well understood and consists
of a free (2, 0) tensor multiplet, i.e. a two-form gauge eld with self-dual eld strength, ve scalars, and
eight spinors. because of the self-duality constraint on the two-form, there is no covariant action for this
eld, but the theory can still be dened in a manner similar to how chiral bosons in two dimensions are
treated [5]. for chiral bosons, we of course know how to write down an interacting theory, namely the
wess-zumino-witten model. so one possible avenue towards understanding the interacting (2, 0) theory
might be to make a similar generalization of the chiral 2-form theory.

in this letter, we will consider the theory of a free non-chiral two-form b on a six dimensional

manifold with coordinates x ,  = 1, . . . , 6. the classical action is

s0 = 

1

12 z d6xgh h ggg ,

(1)

where h = 3d[b] = b + b +  b and d is the covariant derivative compatible with
the background metric g . the eld strength h , and thus the action, is invariant under gauge
transformations acting as b  b + b , where b dx  dx is a closed two-form with integer
periods. given a closed two-dimensional embedded submanifold  with coordinates ,  = 1, 2, we can
construct a gauge-invariant wilson surface observable as

w () = exp 2iz

d  dx x b.

(2)

because of the gauge invariance, we need to introduce a ghost c, an antighost b, and a ghost-for-ghost
. the latter is necessary since the gauge algebra is reducible. the precise form of the ghost action can
be easily obtained using the antield formalism. however, since the theory is free the ghosts decouple
and the precise form of the ghost action is not necessary. to gauge x we use the covariant gauge xing
condition, db = 0 and add a gauge xing term so that the action becomes

s = z d6xg[

12

h h ggg 


2

(db )2]

(3)

with some parameter . a change of  will not aect the correlation functions of gauge invariant
observables, and henceforth we will take  = 1.

2

both the classical action (1) and the observable (2) are invariant under conformal transformations

acting as

g = 2g
b = 0,

(4)

where  is an arbitrary innitesimal parameter function. this invariance is broken by the gauge-xing
term, but the expectation values of wilson surface observables are still formally invariant. indeed, we

have hw ()i = exp(cid:0)42i(cid:1), where

i = z

d  dx ()x ()z

; (x(), x()).

d  d x () x ()

(5)

here ; (x, x ) = hb(x)b (x )i is the propagator for the b -eld. since the conformal invari-
ance of the action is only broken by the gauge xing term, the conformal variation of the propagator
must be given by an exact term, i.e.

; (x, x ) = []; (x, x ) + 

[

||;](x, x )

(6)

for some ; and 
; , where the prime in the derivative indicates that this is a derivative with respect
to the x  variable. since the integral of an exact form over a closed manifold vanishes, it would seem
that i is conformally invariant.

however, in the quantum theory divergences arise and have to be regularized and canceled. this can
be done in a covariant way, but conformal invariance is generally lost. the objective of this letter is to
carry out this procedure and compute the conformal anomaly of this theory. in the next section, we
outline the regularization procedure, in section 3, we discuss the form of possible conformal anomalies,
and in the last section, we present a detailed computation of the anomaly.

2 the regularization procedure

the integrand in (5) divergences along the diagonal of   . to regularize it in a covariant manner,
we exclude from the integration region points with geodesic distance from the diagonal less than some
cut-o distance , i.e. we consider the regulated quantity

i = z

d  dx () x ()z

d  d x () x ()

(cid:0)s2(x(), x())  2(cid:1) ; (x(), x()),

(7)

where s2(x, x ) is the square of the geodesic distance and (t) is the step function. on general grounds,
we expect that

i = 2i2 + log i0 + inite + o(),

(8)

where i2 and i0 are given by some local expressions integrated over . the divergences can thus be
canceled by local counterterms so that we are left with inite, which however will not be conformally
invariant in general. indeed, under a conformal transformation we have

i = 2a2 + a0 + o(),

3

(9)

where the anomaly a0 equals the conformal variation of inite. (the coecient i0 of the logarithmic
divergence of i is always conformally invariant.)

we are thus interested in the conformal variation of i. it is given by

i = z

d  dx () x ()z

d  d x () x ()
(cid:2)(s2(x(), x())  2)s2(x(), x()); (x(), x())
+(s2(x(), x())  2); (x(), x())(cid:3) .

(10)

using (6) and partially integrating the second term, this can be written as

i = z

d  dx () x ()z

d  d x () x ()
(s2(x(), x())  2)(cid:2)s2(x(), x()); (x(), x())
[s2(x(), x())
 [s2(x(), x())]; (x(), x())  

||;](x(), x())i . (11)

3 the form of the anomaly

the quadratic divergent part of i can be removed by a covariant counterterm (as we will see). the
nite piece is the conformal anomaly. only special a0 can be removed by counterterms. since we are
considering innitesimal transformations, a0 is linear in the conformal factor . let us consider rst the
case of a constant , i.e. we set to zero the terms proportional to the derivative of . the remaining terms
are the ones that appear in the logarithmic divergence of the correlation function. they are expected to
satisfy a wess-zumino consistency condition, i.e. the integral of their conformal variation should vanish.
(this may be proven using the method of [6], but we have not carried out such an analysis). this means
that the integrand is either a conformal invariant or it transforms into a total derivative. following [7],
we call type a the anomalies that transform into a total derivative but themselves are not total derivates
and type b the ones that are conformally invariant. we further call type c (c for counterterm) the
ones that are themselves total derivatives. any counterterms will produce terms of this form [3]. we
expect the converse to also be true, i.e. any term which is a total derivative of a covariant expression
can be removed by a counterterm. in our case, there are two possible type a anomalies, and one type b
anomaly, namely

type a : r(2),

type b : w,

(12)

(2x)2  4gp,
4 (r  1

where p is the pull-back of the tensor p = 1
10 r). let us now consider the terms that
are proportional to the derivative of the conformal factor. if we would integrate over the whole manifold
(i.e. consider the usual conformal anomalies), then by partial integration these terms would be converted
into a type c anomalies (i.e. ones that can be removed by counterterms). in our case, however, we only
integrate over . therefore, the terms that involve derivatives of the conformal factor along the normal
directions cannot be converted into type c anomalies. let us call these terms type d. the most general
form of type d terms is xed by dimensional analysis and covariance to be

where 2x  is the mean curvature vector of  (which is equal to the trace of the second fundamental form;
we review the geometry of submanifolds below). recall that the components of the mean curvature vector

type d : d2x ,

(13)

4

tangential to  vanish, so (13) contains only the derivative of  in the normal directions. furthermore, it
is also easy to see that there is no possible type c anomaly (the only candidate consistent with covariance
and dimensions is (13) with   , but this vanishes as we have just remarked). we therefore conclude
that the most general form of the anomaly a0 is a combination of (12) and (13). we will see that our
anomaly is indeed given by such combination.

4 the computation

to calculate (11), we need the propagator and its conformal variation. these can be obtained at
once by the following method. we rst perform a conformal transformation in the gauge xed action
(3) and then invert the kinetic operator. the terms that do not depend on the conformal factor give
the propagator, and the others give its conformal variation. in this way we obtain the nite conformal
variation, but we will use only the innitesimal version. let us perform the conformal transformation
g  e2g . the action (3) becomes

we are interested in the short distance expansion of the propagator in a background with metric
g . it is convenient to work with riemann normal coordinates. in these coordinates the metric has the
following expansion,

g =  +

r(x )(x  x )(x  x ) + o((x  x )3).

(16)

expanding the kinetic operator in riemann normal coordinates and then inverting it, we obtain the short
distance expansion of the propagator and its conformal variation. (in the nal expression, indices are
lowered and raised by the at metric  ; in the expression below we raised the last two indices in order
to display clearly the various antisymmetrizations.) we get

the nal piece that we need is the geodesic distance between two points x and x  in riemann normal
coordinates and its conformal variation. this can be obtained by integrating the geodesic equation. the
result is

s2(x, x ) = |x  x |2(cid:18)2 + (x  x ) +

(20)

to calculate the conformal anomaly we will need some standard facts about the geometry of subman-

ifolds that we now recall. the induced metric is equal to

g = x x g .

the christoel symbols of the induced metric are equal to

(2)

 = g x x g + x x x 

gg.

(21)

(22)

the curvature of the induced metric is related to the target space curvature through the gauss-godazzi
equation,

where r is the pull-back of the target space curvature r and

where w is the pull-back of the weyl tensor w. (notice that w, but not its pull-back, is

we furthermore change integration variables from  to u in (11). we will use riemann normal coordinates
for the induced metric as well4. in particular, the christoel symbols at x() are set to zero and and
4one may bring g to  at the origin by appropriate transformation of  and u. this has the eect of producing a

factor of px   x in the measure of .

notice that the anomaly is indeed a sum of type a, b and d anomalies. one should also note that it is
not a multiple of the anomaly obtained in the large n limit of n -coincident m -theory ve-branes [4].

we note that the quadratic divergence can indeed be removed by wave-function renormalization.

namely, rather than w (), we should consider the renormalized observable

(30)

(more precisely, one should also subtract the logarithmic divergences, but we have not displayed these.)

notice the similarity between the renormalized wilson observable and the worldsheet string action.
pushing this similarity a step further, it is tempting to identify the cut-o  with the string length of
an underlying string theory, and the coecient of r(2) term in the conformal anomaly with its central
change. notice also that the conformal anomaly of the (large n ) interacting (2, 0) theory [4] does not
contain an r(2) term, indicating a cancellation between the various contributions.
