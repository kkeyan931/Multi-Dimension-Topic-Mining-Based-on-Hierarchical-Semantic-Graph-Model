(3.11) result identical result found eq.(2.12) case local operators. course behavior one expect see. case, temporal separation loop operator much bigger size loop, able use operator product expansion loop terms local gauge invariant operators calculate 2-point function. note also 2-point function behaves like (3.12) hw oi a4 4 10 1, 2-point function itself. 1, imaginary part increases. 1, biggest behaves like im(i) 1 a( 1)3/2 . 1, nd imaginary part tends zero like im(i) 2 . (3.13) (3.14) understand result follows. explained below, case, imaginary part integral receives contributions operator close loop r 1 x3 0. temporal separation also small. thus, using heisenberg equations motion, approximate o(~x, t) o(~x, t) = o(~x, ) to(~x, t)|t= ( t). (3.15) see operator commutes wilson loop unless two contact. essentially, single point loop contributes commutator, measure zero eect. commutator turn determines imaginary part integral see eq(3.2) eq(3.3). expect imaginary part integral vanish like power 2 faster. let us see expectation value wilson loop squeezed state h|w ( )|i = 2z dtf (t)( t)im(i) (3.16) carries information corresponding dilaton wave. imaginary part integral function = | t|/a. before, choose f (t) h|o( )|i exactly vanishes < 0. < 0, corre- sponding bulk wave vanishes z < ||. hand, expectation value wilson loop non-trivial time dependence < 0. early remote past, || a, approximate im(i) 1/| t|5. therefore, expectation value tends zero since behaves exactly way expectation value local gauge invariant operators given eq(2.13). || a, imaginary part essentially indepen- dent within domain integration small interval |t| ||. thus expectation value receives timedependence small region integration. within region though, 1 imaginary part tiny. hence, expectation value featureless essentially timedependence. || a, expectation value receives non-trivial timedependence due competition eects f (t) imaginary part i. receives biggest contribution re- gion integration near 0 since 1 imaginary part 11 diverges. || a, wave co-ordinate distance boundary. thus wilson loop detects wave distance boundary comparable size loop, reproduces details depend prole wave. course manifestation uvir relation {$9805114$}. another interesting example, case f (t) oscillatory near = 0 exponentially small otherwise. oscillations well concentrated near = 0. example, may take f (t) polynomial times gaussian. time zero, corresponding bulk wave oscillatory near z = || small neighborhood boundary. case, expectation values local gauge invariant operators behave like h|o( )|i f (0)t ||5 (3.17) remain small unless wave boundary = 0. here, characteristic decay time oscillations f (t). expectation value wilson loop though dierent timedependence. again, using results behavior imaginary part function ratio ||/a, one see expectation value oscillatory || suppressed || || a. short, wave close boundary, small wilson loops excited. time, however, expectation values local gauge invariant operators begin oscillate. hand, wave far boundary big wilson excited. shows precursors fact wilson loops. finally, let us try understand physical origin poles integrand eq(3.8). denominators vanish, 2-point function non-vanishing imaginary part since prescription treating poles becomes relevant. one see eq(3.2) eq(3.3), imaginary part 2-point function determined vacuum expecta- tion value commutator wilson loop operator o. therefore, poles commutator non-vanishing. now, commu- tator non-zero part loop non-trivial measure light-cone o. commutator vector potential point whose separation light-like non-zero, turn contribute commutator wilson loop o. precisely happens poles show below. imaginary part 2-point function vanishes loop inter- secting light-cone, contribution integral region integration real. then, 2-point function non-singular well. suppose operator = 0. loop intersect past light-cone only. |x3| < , light-cone intersects x1 x2 12 plane circle radius = q2 x2 3.

(b.31) first note 2(e+d)+e2 2(ed)+e2 x2 = z dx 1 x2 + o(e). (b.32) turn order d, and, therefore, vanishes since take 0. rst integral calculated before. small number regulates integral near lower limit x = 0, exactly way before. left x1 = 1 qe(2 + e)d + f inite d. (b.33) here, nite piece order e3/2. singular term order d1 arises second piece integrand diverges like 1 hqe(2 + e) xi2 (b.34) near upper limit integration. finally, consider integral x3. dominated singular terms near lower limit integration. near upper limit integration integrand behaves like 1/1 + e x, integral converges. therefore, expand powers (x2 2e e2) consider singular terms. nd (x2 2e e2)2# + f inite. x3 = z 1+e (b.35) nite piece nite 0 e 0 limits. nd (b.36) x2(x2 2e e2) 2(e+d)+e2 dx" 1 + f inite d, x2 + + 1 2 4 x3 = qe(2 + e)d 20 singular term order d1 cancels. again, piece nite order e3/2. taking 0 limit, combine nite piece x3 nite piece x1 expand powers e, nd x1 + x3 = 1 2e3/2 + 7 42e + o(e0). thus imaginary part behaves like im(i) 1 a( 1)3/2 . (b.37) (b.38) also note imaginary part negative 1+. also case 1 limit. thus expect imaginary part increasing negatively 1. finally, let us analyze case 1. case b2 negative contribute imaginary part. extract imaginary part following expression i2 16a z 1+ 1 dr 1 r " 1 (a i)3 + 1 r 1 (a i)#. choose make following change variables rst imaginary part given u = r 1. (b.39) (b.40) im(i) = 2 16a z du 1 u + 1 "(a3 32a) (a2 + 2)3 + 1 u + 1 (a2 + 2)#, (b.41) 2 a2 = 2 u2. turn written follows (a2 + 2)#. 1 + u2 1 u2 change variables setting a2 = x2 get 1 u2 "(a3 32a) (a2 + 2)3 + 8a z du 1 0 (b.42) x2 (x2 + 2)#, 2 8a z 1 0 dx 1 1 x2 (1 2 + 2x2) " (x4 32x2) 2(x2 + 2)3 + (1 + 2 2x2) (1 2 + 2x2) (b.43) rescaled x 1/. second piece integral becomes 2 8a z 1 0 dx 1 1 x2 + o(2) = 3 16a + o(2). (b.44) 21 rst piece integrated using method before. choose small cut-o write integral terms l1 = 2 8a z 0 dx (x4 32x2) 2(1 2)(x2 + 2)3 + o(), (b.45) l2 = 2 8a z 1 dx next observe 1 2x21 x2 (1 2 + 2x2) + o(2). (b.46) 2 dx l2 = 8a z 1 8a z 1 evaluating l1 taking 0, left 2(1 2)x21 x2 0 1 2 dx 1 1 x2 + o(2). (b.47) l1 = 2 8a2(1 2) . (b.48) similarly, taking 0, l2 reduces 8a2(1 2) l2 = 2 3 16a + o(2). (b.49) adding three pieces together, see imaginary part tends zero 1 like 2.
