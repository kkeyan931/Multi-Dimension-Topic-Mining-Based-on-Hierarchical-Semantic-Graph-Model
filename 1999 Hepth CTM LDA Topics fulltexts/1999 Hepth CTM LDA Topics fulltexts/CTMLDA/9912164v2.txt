abstract

in the light of the duality between physics in the bulk of anti-de sitter space and a

conformal eld theory on the boundary, we review the m 2, d3 and m 5 branes and how

their near-horizon geometry yields the compactication of d = 11 supergravity on s7,
type iib supergravity on s5 and d = 11 supergravity on s4, respectively. we discuss

the membrane at the end of the universe idea and its relation to the corresponding

superconformal singleton theories that live on the boundary of the ads4, ads5 and ads7

vacua. the massless sectors of these compactications are described by the maximally

supersymmetric d = 4, d = 5 and d = 7 gauged supergravities. we construct the
non-linear kaluza-klein ansatze describing the embeddings of the u (1)4, u (1)3 and u (1)2

truncations of these supergravities, which admit 4-charge ads4, 3-charge ads5 and 2-

charge ads7 black hole solutions. these enable us to embed the black hole solutions back

in ten and eleven dimensions and reinterpret them as m 2, d3 and m 5 branes spinning in

the transverse dimensions with the black hole charges given by the angular momenta of the

branes. a comprehensive appendix lists the eld equations, symmetries and transformation

rules of d = 11 supergravity, type iib supergravity, and the m 2, d3 and m 5 branes.

introduction

1.1 supergravity, supermembranes and m-theory

a vital ingredient in the quest for a unied theory embracing all physical phenomena is

supersymmetry, a symmetry which (a) unites bosons and fermions, (b) requires the exis-

tence of gravity and (c) places an upper limit of eleven on the dimension of spacetime. for

these reasons, in the early 1980s many physicists looked to eleven-dimensional supergravity

in the hope that it might provide that elusive superunied theory. then in 1984 superuni-

cation underwent a major paradigm-shift: eleven-dimensional supergravity was knocked

o its pedestal by ten-dimensional superstrings , one-dimensional objects whose vibrational

modes represent the elementary particles. unlike eleven-dimensional supergravity, super-

strings provided a perturbatively nite theory of gravity which, after compactication to

four spacetime dimensions, seemed in principle capable of explaining the standard model

of the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces including the required chiral representations

of quarks and leptons.

despite these major successes, however, nagging doubts persisted about superstrings.

first, many of the most important questions in string theory  how do strings break

supersymmetry? how do they choose the right vacuum state? how do they explain the

smallness of the cosmological constant? how do they resolve the apparent paradoxes of

quantum black holes?  seemed incapable of being answered within the framework of a

weak coupling perturbation expansion. they seemed to call for some new, non-perturbative,

physics. secondly, why did there appear to be ve dierent mathematically consistent
superstring theories: the e8  e8 heterotic string, the so(32) heterotic string, the so(32)
type i string, the type iia and type iib strings? if one is looking for a unique theory of

everything, this seems like an embarrassment of riches! thirdly, if supersymmetry permits

eleven dimensions, why do superstrings stop at ten? this question became more acute with

the discoveries of the elementary supermembrane in 1987 and its dual partner, the solitonic

supervebrane, in 1992. these are supersymmetric extended objects with respectively two

and ve dimensions moving in an eleven-dimensional spacetime. finally, therefore, if we

are going to generalize zero-dimensional point particles to one-dimensional strings, why

stop there? why not two-dimensional membranes or more generally p-dimensional objects

(inevitably dubbed p-branes)? although this latter possibility was pursued by a small

but dedicated group of theorists, starting in about 1986, it was largely ignored by the

mainstream physics community.

4

well, the year 1995 witnessed a new paradigm-shift: perturbative ten-dimensional su-

perstrings have in their turn been superseded by a new non-perturbative theory called m -

theory, which describes, amongst other things, supermembranes and supervebranes, which

subsumes the above ve consistent strings theories, and which has as its low-energy limit,

eleven-dimensional supergravity! according to fields medalist edward witten m stands

for magical, mystery or membrane, according to taste. new evidence in favor of this the-

ory is appearing daily on the internet and represents the most exciting development in the

subject since 1984 when the superstring revolution rst burst on the scene.

thus this new framework now provides the starting point for understanding a wealth of

new non-perturbative phenomena, including string/string duality, seiberg-witten theory,

quark connement, qcd, particle physics phenomenology, quantum black holes, cosmology

and, ultimately, their complete synthesis in a nal theory of physics.

1.2 the kaluza-klein idea

cast your minds back to 1919. maxwells theory of electromagnetism was well established

and einstein had recently formulated his general theory of relativity. by contrast, the

strong and weak interactions were not well understood. in searching for a unied theory

of the fundamental forces, therefore, it was natural to attempt to merge gravity with elec-

tromagnetism. this kaluza was able to do through the remarkable device of postulating

an extra fth dimension for spacetime. consider einsteins theory of pure gravity in ve
spacetime dimensions with signature (, +, +, +, +). the line element is given by

ds5

2 = gm n dxm dxn

where m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. kaluza then made the 4 + 1 split

gm n = e/3  g + e3aa

(1.3)

where xm = (x, y),  = 0, 1, 2, 3,. thus the elds g (x), a(x) and (x) transform

respectively as a tensor, a vector and a scalar under four-dimensional general coordinate

5

transformations. all this was at the classical level, of course, but in the modern parlance

of quantum eld theory, they would be described as the spin 2 graviton, the spin 1 photon
and the spin 0 dilaton3. of course it is not enough to call a by the name photon, one must

demonstrate that it satises maxwells equations and here we see the kaluza miracle at work.

after making the same 4 + 1 split of the ve-dimensional einstein equations rm n = 0, we

correctly recover not only the einstein equations for g (x) but also the maxwell equation

for a(x) and the massless klein-gordon equation for (x). thus maxwells theory of

electromagnetism is an inevitable consequence of einsteins general theory of relativity,

given that one is willing to buy the idea of a fth dimension.

attractive though kaluzas idea was, it suered from two obvious drawbacks. first,

although the indices were allowed to range over 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, for no very good reason the

dependence on the extra coordinate y was suppressed. secondly, if there is a fth dimension

why havent we seen it? the resolution of both these problems was supplied by oskar klein

in 1926. klein insisted on treating the extra dimension seriously but assumed the fth
dimension to have circular topology so that the coordinate y is periodic, 0  my  2,
where m has dimensions of mass. thus the space has topology r4  s1. it is dicult to
envisage a spacetime with this topology but a simpler analogy is provided by a garden hose:
at large distances it looks like a line r1 but closer inspection reveals that at every point on
the line there is a little circle, and the topology is r1  s1. so it was that klein suggested
that there is a little circle at each point in four-dimensional spacetime.

let us consider kleins proposal from a modern perspective. we start with pure gravity

in ve dimensions described by the action

i5 =

1
25

2z d5xgr

i5 is invariant under the ve-dimensional general coordinate transformations

gm n = m p gp n + n p gm p + p p gm n

(1.4)

(1.5)

the periodicity in y means that the elds gm n (x, y), am (x, y) and (x, y) may be expanded

in the form

g (x, y) =

a(x, y) =

n=xn=
n=xn=

g(n)(x)einmy,

a(n)(x)einmy,

3the dilaton was considered an embarrassment in 1919, and was (inconsistently) set equal to zero.

however, it was later revived and subsequently stimulated brans-dicke theories of gravity. the dilaton also

plays a crucial role in m -theory

6

with

(x, y) =

n=xn=

(n)einmy

g(n)(x) = g(n)(x)

(1.6)

(1.7)

etc. so (as one now nds in all the textbooks) a kaluza-klein theory describes an innite

number of four-dimensional elds. however (as one nds in none of the textbooks) it also

describes an innite number of four-dimensional symmetries since we may also fourier
expand the general coordinate parameter (x, y) as follows

(x, y) =

4(x, y) =

n=xn=
n=xn=



(n)(x)einmy

(n)(x)einmy

(1.8)

with m

(n) = m

(n).

let us rst focus on the n = 0 modes in (1.6), which are just kaluzas graviton, photon

and dilaton. substituting (1.3) and (1.6) in the action (1.4), integrating over y and retaining

just the n = 0 terms we obtain (dropping the 0 subscripts)

the symmetry of the vacuum, determined by the vevs

hgi = , hai = 0, hi = 0

(1.12)

(1.13)

is the four-dimensional poincare group r. thus, the masslessness of the graviton is due
to general covariance, the masslessness of the photon to gauge invariance, but the dilaton is

massless because it is the goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breakdown of

the global scale invariance. note that the gauge group is r rather than u (1) because this

truncated n = 0 theory has lost all memory of the periodicity in y.

now, however, let us include the n 6= 0 modes. an important observation is that the
assumed topology of the ground state, namely r4  s1, restricts us to general coordinate
transformations periodic in y. whereas the general covariance (1.10) and local gauge in-

variance (1.11) simply correspond to the n = 0 modes of (1.5) respectively, the global scale

invariance is no longer a symmetry because it corresponds to a rescaling

gm n =

gm n

combined with a general coordinate transformation

4 = y/m

(1.14)

(1.15)

which is now forbidden by the periodicity requirement. the eld  is therefore merely a

pseudo-goldstone boson.

just as ordinary general covariance may be regarded as the local gauge symmetry corre-

sponding to the global poincare algebra and local gauge invariance as the gauge symmetry

corresponding to the global abelian algebra, so the innite parameter local transformations

(1.8) correspond to an innite-parameter global algebra with generators

p 

n = einmy

m 

n = einmy(x  x)
qn = ieinmy/(my)

(1.16)

it is in fact a kac-moody-virasoro generalization of the poincare/gauge algebra. although

this larger algebra describes a symmetry of the four-dimensional theory, the symmetry of

8

the vacuum determined by (1.13) is only poincare u (1). thus the gauge parameters 
and 4
n with n 6= 0 each correspond to spontaneously broken generators, and it follows that
for n 6= 0 the elds an and n are the corresponding goldstone boson elds. the gauge
elds g n, with two degrees of freedom, will then each acquire a mass by absorbing the

n

two degrees of freedom of each vector goldstone boson an and the one degree of freedom

of each scalar goldstone boson n to yield a pure spin 2 massive particle with ve degrees

of freedom. this accords with the observation that the massive spectrum is pure spin two.

thus we nd an innite tower of charged, massive spin 2 particles with charges en and

masses mn given by

en = n24m, mn = |n|/r

(1.17)

where r is the radius of the s1 given by r2m2 = hgyyi. thus klein explained (for the rst
time) the quantization of electric charge. (note also that charge conjugation is just parity
tranformation y  y in the fth dimension.) of course, if we identify the fundamental
unit of charge e = 24m with the charge on the electron, then we are forced to take m to
be very large: the planck mass 1019 gev , way beyond the range of any current or forseeable

accelerator. this answers the second question left unanswered by kaluza because with m
very large, the radius of the circle must be very small: the planck size 1035 meters, which
satisfactorily accords with our everyday experience of living in four spacetime dimensions.4

it is interesting to note that, despite the inconsistency problems that arise in coupling

a nite number of massive spin two particles to gravity and/or electromagnetism, kaluza-

klein theory is consistent by virtue of having an innite tower of such states. any attempt

to truncate to a nite non-zero number of massive modes would reintroduce the inconsis-

tency. we also note, however, that these massive kaluza-klein modes have the unusual

gyromagnetic ratio g = 1. moreover, when we embed the theory in a superstring theory or

m -theory, these kaluza-klein states will persist as a subset of the full string or m -theory
spectrum. it is sometimes claimed that g 6= 2 leads to unacceptable high-energy behaviour
for compton scattering. however, although the classical value g = 2 is required in qed,

4a variation on the kaluza-klein theme is that our universe is a 3-brane embedded in a higher dimensional

spacetime[208, 209, 210]. this is particularly compelling in the context of the type iib threebrane [211]

since the worldvolume elds necessarily include gauge elds [58]. thus the strong, weak and electromagnetic

forces might be conned to the worldvolume of the brane while gravity propagates in the bulk. it has recently
been suggested that, in such schemes, the extra dimensions might be much larger than 1035 meters [212, 213]

and may even be a large as a millimeter [214, 215, 216, 237]. in yet another variation, the brane occupies

the boundary of ads5 and the extra fth dimension is innite [238]. once again, the near horizon geometry

of the d3-brane provides an example of this, as discussed in section 3.2.

9

the standard model, and indeed open string theory, this is not a universal rule. tree level

unitarity applies only in the energy regime mp lanck > e > m/q for a particle of mass m

and charge q, and this range is empty for kaluza-klein theory.

in summary, it seems that a ve-dimensional world with one of its dimensions compact-

ied on a circle is operationally indistinguishable from a four-dimensional world with a very

particular (albeit innite) mass spectrum.

1.3 the eld content

eleven is the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent su-

persymmetric theory, as was rst recognized by nahm [37] in his classication of supersym-

metry algebras. the easiest way to see this is to start in four dimensions and note that

one supersymmetry relates states diering by one half unit of helicity.

if we now make

the reasonable assumption that there be no massless particles with spins greater than two,
then we can allow up to a maximum of n = 8 supersymmetries taking us from helicity 2
through to helicity +2. since the minimal supersymmetry generator is a majorana spinor

with four o-shell components, this means a total of 32 spinor components. a discussion of

spinors and dirac matrices in d spacetime dimensions may be found in the reprint volume
of salam and sezgin [202]. now in a spacetime with d dimensions and signature (1, d  1),
the maximum value of d admitting a 32 component spinor is d = 11. (going to d = 12, for

example, would require 64 components.) see table 25. furthermore, as we shall see later,

d = 11 emerges naturally as the maximum dimension admitting supersymmetric extended

objects, without the need for any assumptions about higher spin. not long after nahms

paper, cremmer, julia and scherk [200] realized that supergravity not only permits up to

seven extra dimensions but in fact takes its simplest and most elegant form when written in

its full eleven-dimensional glory. the unique d = 11, n = 1 supermultiplet is comprised of

a graviton gm n , a gravitino m and 3-form gauge eld am n p with 44, 128 and 84 physical

degrees of freedom, respectively. for a counting of on-shell degrees of freedom in higher

dimensions, see table 1. the theory may also be formulated in superspace. ironically, how-

ever, these extra dimensions were not at rst taken seriously but rather regarded merely as

a useful device for deriving supergravities in four dimensions. indeed d = 4, n = 8 super-

gravity was rst obtained by cremmer and julia via the process of dimensional reduction

i.e. by requiring that all the elds of d = 11, n = 1 supergravity be independent of the

5conventions dier on how to count the supersymmetries and in later sections we follow the more usual

convention [200] that nmax = 8 in d = 5 and in nmax = 4 d = 7

extra seven coordinates.

for many years the kaluza-klein idea of taking extra dimensions seriously was largely

forgotten but the arrival of eleven-dimensional supergravity provided the missing impetus.

the kind of four-dimensional world we end up with depends on how we compactify these

extra dimensions: maybe seven of them would allow us to give a gravitational origin, `a

la kaluza-klein, to the strong and weak forces as well as the electromagnetic. in a very

inuential paper, witten [217] drew attention to the fact that in such a scheme the four-

dimensional gauge group is determined by the isometry group of the compact manifold
k. moreover, he proved (what to this day seems to be merely a gigantic coincidence)
that seven is not only the maximum dimension of k permitted by supersymmetry but the

in the early 80s there was great interest in four-dimensional n -extended supergravities

for which the global so(n ) is promoted to a gauge symmetry [8]. in these theories the

underlying supersymmetry algebra is no longer poincare but rather anti-de sitter (ads4)

and the lagrangian has a non-vanishing cosmological constant  proportional to the square

of the gauge coupling constant g:

g  g2

(1.18)

where g is newtons constant. the n > 4 gauged supergravities were particularly interest-

ing since the cosmological constant  does not get renormalized [9] and hence the so(n )
gauge symmetry has vanishing -function6. the relation (1.18) suggested that there might

and the pure supergravity theories are not asymptotically free. the addition of matter supermultiplets only

makes the  function more positive [10] and hence gravitinos can never be conned. i am grateful to karim

indeed, the maximal (d = 4, n = 8)

gauged supergravity [11] was seen to correspond to the massless sector of (d = 11, n = 1)
supergravity [12] compactied on an s7 whose metric admits an so(8) isometry and 8

killing spinors [13]. an important ingredient in these developments that had been insu-
ciently emphasized in earlier work on kaluza-klein theory was that the ads4s7 geometry
was not fed in by hand but resulted from a spontaneous compactication, i.e. the vacuum

state was obtained by nding a stable solution of the higher-dimensional eld equations
[14]. the mechanism of spontaneous compactication appropriate to the ads4  s7 solu-
tion of eleven-dimensional supergravity was provided by the freund-rubin mechanism [15]

in which the 4-form eld strength in spacetime f ( = 0, 1, 2, 3) is proportional to the

a summary of this s7 and other x 7 compactications of d = 11 supergravity down to

ads4 may be found in [20]. by applying a similar mechanism to the 7-form dual of this
eld strength one could also nd compactications on ads7  s4 [17] whose massless sector
describes gauged maximal n = 4, so(5) supergravity in d = 7 [18, 19]. type iib su-

pergravity in d = 10, with its self-dual 5-form eld strength, also admits a freund-rubin
compactication on ads5  s5 [23, 24, 25] whose massless sector describes gauged maximal
n = 8 supergravity in d = 5 [26, 27].

in the three cases given above, the symmetry of the vacuum is described by the su-
pergroups osp(4|8), su (2, 2|4) and osp(6, 2|4) for the s7, s5 and s4 compactications
respectively, as shown in table 3. each of these groups is known to admit the so-called
singleton, doubleton or tripleton7 supermultiplets [28] as shown in table 4. we recall that

singletons are those strange representations of ads rst identied by dirac [29] which admit

no analogue in at spacetime. they have been much studied by fronsdal and collaborators

[30, 31].

this kaluza-klein approach to d = 11 supergravity [204] eventually fell out of favor

for three reasons. first, as emphasized by witten [203], it is impossible to derive by

the conventional kaluza-klein technique of compactifying on a manifold a chiral theory

7our nomenclature is based on the ads4, ads5 and ads7 groups having ranks 2, 3 and 4, respectively,

and diers from that of gunaydin.

13

in four spacetime dimensions starting from a non-chiral theory such as eleven-dimensional

supergravity.

ironically, horava and witten [102] were to solve this problem years later

by compactifying on something that is not a manifold!. secondly, in spite of its maximal

supersymmetry and other intriguing features, eleven dimensional supergravity was, after

all, still a eld theory of gravity with all the attendant problems of non-renormalizability.

for a recent discussion, see [246]. this problem also had to await the dawn of m -theory,

since we now regard d = 11 supergravity not as a fundamental theory in its own right

but the eective low-energy lagrangian of m -theory. thirdly, these ads vacua necessarily

have non-vanishing cosmological constant unless cancelled by fermion condensates [110].

and this was deemed unacceptable at the time. however, as we shall now describe, ads is

currently undergoing a renaissance thanks to the ads/cf t correspondence.

1.4 the ads/cft correspondence

a by-product of m -theory has been the revival of anti-de sitter space brought about by

maldacenas conjectured duality between physics in the bulk of ads and a conformal eld
in particular, m -theory on ads4  s7 is dual to a non-
theory on the boundary [111].
abelian (n = 8, d = 3) superconformal theory, type iib string theory on ads5  s5 is
dual to a d = 4 su (n ) super yang-mills theory theory and m -theory on ads7  s4 is
in particular, as has
dual to a non-abelian ((n+, n) = (2, 0), d = 6) conformal theory.
been spelled out most clearly in the d = 4 su (n ) yang-mills case, there is seen to be a

correspondence between the kaluza-klein mass spectrum in the bulk and the conformal

dimension of operators on the boundary [123, 125]. this duality thus holds promise not

only of a deeper understanding of m -theory, but may also throw light on non-perturbative

aspects of the theories that live on the boundary which can include four-dimensional gauge

theories. models of this kind, where a bulk theory with gravity is equivalent to a boundary

theory without gravity, have also been advocated by t hooft [131] and by susskind [132]

who call them holographic theories. the reader may notice a striking similarity to the earlier

idea of the membrane at the end of the universe[38, 44, 39, 45, 46], whereby the p-brane
occupies the s1  sp boundary of adsp+2 and is described by a superconformal singleton
theory and to the membrane/supergravity bootstrap [38, 44, 39] which conjectured that

the dynamics of the supergravity in the bulk of ads was dictated by the membrane on

its boundary and vice-versa. for example, one immediately recognises that the dimensions

and supersymmetries of the three conformal theories in maldacenas duality are exactly

the same as the singleton, doubleton and tripleton supermultiplets of table 3. further

14

interconnections between the two are currently being explored. see [160, 141] and section

5.4.

1.5 plan of the lectures

the rst purpose of these lectures will be to explain an area of research that was very

active about ten years ago, namely anti-de sitter space, the membrane at the end of the

universe, singletons, superconformal theories, the membrane/supergravity bootstrap and all

that. these topics have recently undergone a revival of interest thanks to the the ads/cf t

conjecture of maldacena [111] which suggests a duality between physics in the bulk of ads

and a superconformal theory on its boundary. we may thus regard this earlier work as a

prequel (ads/cf t episode 1?). the second purpose is to discuss some very recent work

on black holes in ads which are interesting in their own right as well as nding application

in the ads/cf t correspondence. both these topics will rst require a thorough grounding

in kaluza-klein theory, d = 11 supergravity, d = 10 type iib supergravity and m 2, d3

and m 5 branes.

in section 2, we discuss the bosonic sector of d = 11 supergravity and those brane solu-

tions (so called bps branes) that preserve half of the supersymmetry: the supermembrane

(m 2-brane) and the supervebrane (m 5-brane). these solutions, together with the plane

wave [56] and kaluza-klein monopole [222], which also preserve half the supersymmetry,

are the progenitors of the lower dimensional bps objects of m -theory.

in section 3, we discuss the bosonic sector of type iib supergravity and the self-dual

super threebrane (d3-brane) solution which also preserves one half of the supersymmetry.

these m 2, d3 and m 5 bps branes may be regarded as the extremal mass=charge limit

of more general two-parameter black brane solutions that exhibit event horizons. in the
near-horizon limit, they tend respectively to the ads4s7, the ads5s5 and the ads7s4
vacua of the maximally supersymmetric d = 4, d = 5 and d = 7 gauged supergravities

that correspond to the massless sector of the compactication of d = 11 supergravity on
s7, type iib supergravity on s5 and d = 11 supergravity on s4, respectively. these are

also treated in sections 2 and 3, as is the issue of consistent kaluza-klein truncation to the

massless sector.

the zero modes of these three brane solutions are described by green-schwarz type

covariant brane actions whose bosonic sectors are treated in section 4. these will be crucial

for section 5, whose purpose will be to explain anti-de sitter space, the membrane at the

end of the universe, singletons, superconformal theories and the membrane/supergravity

15

bootstrap. in particular, by focussing on the bosonic radial mode, we show in detail how
the superconformal singleton action on s1  s2 (including the scalar mass term) follows
from the action for a spherical m 2 brane on the boundary of ads4  s7 in the limit of large
radius: the membrane at the end of the universe. (we also indicate, following [141] how

this generalizes to generic branes with spherical topology but arbitrary geometry.) then we

compare and contrast these old results with the comparatively recent maldacena conjecture.

since the ads/cf t correspondence will be the subject matter of several other lecturers

at this school, we shall not dwell on the implications of our results for this correspondence

but simply present them as interesting in their own right.

as we have seen, these ads spaces emerge as the vacua of the maximally supersymmetric

d = 4, d = 5 and d = 7 gauged supergravities that correspond to the massless sector of
the compactication of d = 11 supergravity on s7, type iib supergravity on s5 and

d = 11 supergravity on s4, respectively. recently, therefore, black hole solutions of gauged

supergravity have attracted a good deal of attention and these are the subject of section 6

in [150], for example, new anti-de sitter black hole solutions of gauged n = 8, d = 4,
so(8) supergravity were presented. by focussing on the u (1)4 cartan subgroup, non-

extremal 1, 2, 3 and 4 charge solutions were found. in the extremal limit, they may preserve

up to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8 and 1/8 of the supersymmetry respectively. by contrast, the magnetic

solutions preserve none. since n = 8, d = 4 supergravity is a consistent truncation of
n = 1, d = 11 supergravity, resulting from the s7 compactication, it follows that these

black holes will also be solutions of this theory. in [150], it was conjectured that a subset of

the extreme electric black holes preserving 1/2 the supersymmetry may be identied with
the s7 kaluza-klein spectrum, with the non-abelian quantum numbers provided by the

fermionic zero modes.

in [207] the non-linear kaluza-klein ansatze describing the embeddings of the u (1)4,

u (1)3 and u (1)2 truncations of these supergravities were presented, which admit 4-charge

ads4, 3-charge ads5 and 2-charge ads7 black hole solutions. these enable us to embed the

black hole solutions back in ten and eleven dimensions and reinterpret them as m 2, d3 and

m 5 branes spinning in the transverse dimensions with the black hole charges given by the
angular momenta of the branes. it is curious that the same u (1)4, u (1)3 and u (1)2 black

hole charges appear in these spherical compactications as in the toroidal compactications

but for totally dierent reasons. instead of arising from the intersection of dierent non-

rotating branes, they arise from the dierent angular momenta of a single brane. this is

indicative of deeper levels of duality yet to be uncovered.

16

at the end of each of these sections there are problems whose solutions may be found

in section 7.

much of what we need to do in these lectures involves only the bosonic sectors of the

supergravities and the branes. for completeness, however, a comprehensive appendix lists

the complete eld equations, symmetries and transformation rules of d = 11 supergravity,

type iib supergravity and the m 2, d3 and m 5 branes, with all the fermionic terms

included.

introductory treatments of supersymmetry and supergravity may be found in [1, 2, 3, 4,

5, 243], of kaluza-klein theories in [217, 204, 205, 218, 202], of supermembranes in [38, 7,

47, 201, 219, 112], of m -theory in [101, 6, 103, 242] and of the ads/cf t correspondence

in [239, 221, 160].

2.2 ads4 s7
in this section, we examine the spontaneous compactication of d = 11 supergravity.

we are interested in obtaining a four-dimensional theory which admits maximal spacetime
symmetry. with signature (+++), this means that the vacuum should be invariant under
so(4, 1), poincare or so(3, 2) according as the cosmological constant is positive, zero or

negative, corresponding to de sitter, minkowski or anti-de sitter space, respectively.

the rst requirement of maximal symmetry is that the vev of any fermion eld should

vanish and accordingly we set

hmi = 0

(2.4)

and focus our attention on vacuum solutions of the bosonic equations (2.1) and (2.2). we
look for solutions of the direct product form m4  m7 compatible with maximal spacetime
symmetry. we denote the spacetime coordinates by x,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 and the internal
coordinates by ym, m = 1, . . . , 7. the ansatz of freund and rubin [15] is to set

f =

(2.5)

with all other components vanishing, where a is a real constant and the factor 3/2 is chosen

for future convenience. for future reference, it will prove convenient to rewrite this in terms

of the dual eld strength

where 7 is the volume form on the internal manifold, and where l = 2/a. at the moment,

l is just an arbitrary constant of integration, but in section 2.4 we shall relate it to the

tension of an m 2 brane. substituting into the eld equations we nd that (2.2) is trivially

satised while (2.1) yields the product of a four-dimensional einstein spacetime

for future reference we also record the form taken by the supercovariant derivative dm
(2.36) when evaluated in the freund-rubin background geometry. first we decompose the

and where ,  . . . are spacetime idices for the tangent space group so(1, 3) and a, b, . . . are

the extra-dimensional indices for the tangent space group so(7). substituting the freund-

some comments are now in order. the constancy of a in the ansatz (2.5) is necessary

to solve the eld equations, but other ansatze are possible and are discussed in [20]. the

maximally spacetime symmetric solution of (2.7) is, in fact, ads4 since the cosmological

constant

 = 3a2

is negative. ads4 can be dened as the four-dimensional hyperboloid

in r5 with cartesian coordinates ya, where

representations of so(3, 2) are denoted d(e0, s), where e0 is the lowest energy eigen-

value (in units of a) and s is the total angular momentum. the representation is unitary
provided e0  s + 1/2 for s = 0, 1/2 and e0  s + 1 for s  1. the representations are

19

all innite dimensional. of course, in addition to being the ads group in four dimensions,

so(3, 2) has the interpretation as the conformal group in three dimensions, where the quan-

tum number e0 plays the role of the conformal weight. this will prove signicant in the

ads/cf t correspondence.

there are innitely many seven-dimensional einstein spaces m7 satisfying (2.8) and we

now turn to the question of how much unbroken supersymmetry survives. recall from (2.4)

that the vev of the gravitino has been set to zero. for a supersymmetric vacuum we require

that it remain zero under a supersymmetry transformation (a.16)

to solve this in the freund-rubin background, we look for solutions of the form

hmi = h dm i = 0

(x, y) = (x)(y)

(2.20)

(2.21)

where (x) is an anticommuting four-component spinor in d = 4 and (y) is a commuting

eight-component spinor in d = 7, satisfying

d(x) = 0

dm(y) = 0

(2.22)

(2.23)

thus the problem of counting unbroken supersymmetries is equivalent to the problem of

counting killing spinors.

it is not dicult to establish that ads4 admits the maximum

number (i.e.

four) as far as spacetime is concerned, and so the number n of unbroken

generators of ads supersymmetry is given by the number of killing spinors on m7. from

(2.13) these are seen to satisfy the integrability condition [69]

[ dm, dn] = 

1
4

cmn

abab = 0

(2.24)

where cmn

ab is the weyl tensor. the subgroup of spin(7) (the double cover of the tangent

space group so(7)) generated by these linear combinations of the spin(7) generators ab
corresponds to the holonomy group h of the generalized connection appearing in dm. thus
the maximum number of unbroken supersymmetries nmax is equal to the number of spinors
left invariant by h. this in turn is given by the number of singlets appearing in the
decomposition of the 8 of spin(7) under h. for example, the squashed s7 of [69, 70] has
h = g2 and hence nmax = 1.

in the supersymmetric context, all linear irreducible representations of n = 1 ads

supersymmetry were classied by heidenreich [32]. they fall into 4 classes:

20

1. d(1/2, 0)  d(1, 1/2)
2. d(e0, 0)  d(e0 + 1/2, 1/2)  d(e0 + 1, 0), e0  1/2
3. d(s + 1, s)  d(s + 3/2, s + 1/2), s  1/2
4. d(e0, s)  d(e0 + 1/2, s + 1/2)  d(e0 + 1/2, s  1/2)  d(e0 + 1, s).
class 1 is the singleton supermultiplet which has no analogue in poincare supersymme-

try. singletons are the subject of section 5. class 2 is the wess-zumino supermultiplet.
class 3 is the gauge supermultiplet with spins s and s + 1/2 with s  1/2. class 4 is
the higher spin supermultiplet. the corresponding study of osp(4|n ) representations was
neglected in the literature until their importance in kaluza-klein supergravity became ap-
parent. for example, the round s7 leads to massive n = 8 supermultiplets with maximum

spin 2. this corresponds to an ads type of multiplet shortening analogous to the short-

eneing due to central charges in poincare supersymmetry [33]. two features emerge: (1)
osp(4|n ) multiplets may be decomposed into the osp(4|1) multiplets discussed above; (2)
in the limit as a  0 and the osp(4|n ) contracts to the n -extended poincare algebra, all
short ads multiplets become massless poincare multiplets.

in this section we shall focus on the maximally symmetric round s7, for which cmn

ab = 0

yielding the maximum n = 8 killing spinors, and hence on the eleven-dimensional vacuum
ads4  s7. the kaluza-klein mechanism will give rise to an eective d = 4 theory with
n = 8 supersymmetry and local so(8) invariance, describing a massless n = 8 multiplet

coupled to an innite tower of massive n = 8 supermultiplets with masses quantized in
units of l1, the inverse radius of s7. combining the internal so(8) symmetry and n = 8

supersymmetry with the so(2, 3) of the ads4 spacetime, it is readily seen that the complete
symmetry is osp(4|8). it follows without any further calculation that the massless sector
on s7 is given by the familiar massless n = 8 supermultiplet consisting of (1 spin 2, 8 spin

3/2, 28 spin 1, 56 spin 1/2, 70 spin zero), but a calculation is required to see the d = 11

origin of these elds, which is dierent from that of t 7. see table 8.

2.3 consistent truncation to the massless modes

an entirely dierent question is whether the massive modes can be consistently truncated to

yield just gauged n = 8 supergravity. a consistent truncation is dened to be one for which

all solutions of the truncated theory are solutions of the original theory. it requires that the

truncated elds must never appear linearly in the action, otherwise setting them to zero

would result in further constraints on the massless modes over and above the equations

of motion of the massless theory [164, 161, 162, 165].

interestingly enough, for generic

21

kaluza-klein theories, truncation to the massless sector is not consistent. to illustrate

this, consider the eld equations of pure gravity with a positive cosmological constant  in

d = 4 + k dimensions

rm n = gm n

(2.25)

this theory admits the ground-state solution of (d = 4 de sitter spacetime)  (compact
manifold mk). in some earlier kaluza-klein literature, it was generally believed that the

correct ansatz for the metric gm n (x, y) is given by

g (x, y) = g (x) + a

ik mi(y)(x)a

j(x)k nj(y)gmn(y)

gn(x, y) = a

i(x)k mi(y)gmn(y)

gmn(x, y) = gmn(y)

(2.26)

where gmn(y) is the metric on mk. the quantities k mi(y) are the killing vectors corre-

sponding to the isometries of this metric and i runs over the dimension of the isometry

group g. the claim that this is the correct ansatz was based on the observation that

substituting this ansatz into the higher-dimensional einstein action and integrating over y,

one obtains the four-dimensional einstein-yang-mills action with metric g (x) and gauge

potential a

i(x).

however, the correct kaluza-klein ansatz must be consistent with the higher dimen-

sional eld equations and, as we shall now demonstrate, this is not in general true. for

example, the four-dimensional einstein equations read

(2.27)

where f

i is the yang-mills eld strength. the inconsistency is now apparent. the left-

hand side is independent of y while the right-hand side in general depends on y via the
ik nj. for example, when mk = sk with its so(k + 1)

killing vector combination kn

invariant metric.

kn

ik nj = ij + y ij(y)

(2.28)

where y ij(y) is that harmonic of the scalar laplacian with next to lowest non-vanishing
eigenvalue 2(k + 1)/(k  1) belonging to the k(k + 3)/2 dimensional representation of
so(k + 1).

this situation changes radically when we turn to the s7 compactication d = 11 super-
gravity. the reason for the dierence is the presence of the three-index gauge eld am n p

22

in addition to the metric gm n . the crucial observation is that the standard kaluza-klein

the miracle of the s7 compactication is that

(2.31)

and so the right-hand side of (2.30) becomes the correct energy-momentum tensor of so(8)
yang-mills! indeed the round s7 is the only m7 solution of (2.8) known to satisfy (2.31).

2.4 the supermembrane solution

historically, the equations of motion of d = 11 supergravity were written down in 1978

[200] and the d = 11 supermembrane was discovered as a fundamental object in its own

right in 1987 [41, 42]. in 1990, however, it was realized [51] that the d = 11 supermembrane

arises as a classical solution of the supergravity eld equations which preserves one half of

the spacetime supersymmetry. we shall now describe this solution.

we begin by making an ansatz for the d = 11 gauge elds gm n = em

bab and
am n p corresponding to the most general three-eight split invariant under p3  so(8),
where p3 is the d = 3 poincare group. we split the d = 11 coordinates

aen

xm = (x, ym)

where  = 0, 1, 2 and m = 3, 4, . . . , 10, and write the line element as

ds2 = e2a dxdx + e2bmndxmdxn

and the 3-form gauge eld as

a012 = ec

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

all other components of am n p and all components of the gravitino m are set equal to
zero. p3 invariance requires that the arbitrary functions a, b and c depend only on ym;
so(8) invariance then requires that this dependence be only through y = mnymyn.

23

as we shall show, the three arbitrary functions a, b, and c are reduced to one by the

requirement that the eld conguration (2.33) and (2.34) preserve some unbroken super-

symmetry. in other words, there must exist killing spinors  satisfying

dm  = 0

(2.35)

where dm is the bosonic part of the supercovariant derivative appearing in the supersym-
metry transformation rule of the gravitino (a.18)

dm = m +

(m

(2.36)

we make the three-eight split

where  and a are the d = 3 and d = 8 dirac matrices respectively and where

a = (  9, 1  a)

so that 9

2 = 1. we also decompose the spinor eld as

9 = 34 . . . 10

(x, y) = (x)  (y)

(2.37)

(2.38)

(2.39)

where  is a constant spinor of so(1, 2) and  is an so(8) spinor which may further be

decomposed into chiral eigenstates via the projection operators (1 + 9)/2.

in our background (2.33) and (2.34), the supercovariant derivative becomes:

d =

(2.40)

note that the  and m carry world indices. hence we nd that (2.35) admits two non-

trivial solutions

(1 + 9) = 0

a =

c + constant

24

(2.41)

(2.42)

(2.43)

in each case, (2.41) means that one half of the maximal possible supersymmetry survives.

with the substitutions (2.33), (2.34) and (2.43), the einstein equation and the 3-form

equation reduce to the single equation for one unknown:

mnmnec = 0

(2.44)

and hence, imposing the boundary condition that the metric be asymptotically minkowskian,

we nd

ec = 1 +

b6
y6

(2.45)

where b is a constant, at this stage arbitrary, and y2 = mnymyn. thus the metric is given

by

ds2 = (1 + b6/y6)2/3dxdx + (1 + b6/y6)1/3(dy2 + y2d7

2)

(2.46)

and the 7-form eld strength by

f7  f4 +

1
2

a3  f4 = 6b67

(2.47)

here 7 is the volume form on s7 and 7 is the volume. the mass per unit area of the
membrane m3 is given by:

11

2m3 = 3b67

(2.48)

this elementary solution is a singular solution of the supergravity equations coupled to a

supermembrane source and carries a noether electric charge

q =

1

211zs7

f7 = 211m3

hence the solution saturates the bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld (bps) bound

211m3  q.

(2.49)

(2.50)

this is a consequence of the preservation of half the supersymmetries. of course, the

equation (2.44) displays a delta-function singularity at the origin and hence requires a

source term. this is provided by adding to the supergravity action (a.1) the action of the

supermembrane itself [51], discussed in section 4.1. we nd, as expected, that the mass
per unit volume m3 is just the membrane tension t3

m3 = t3

(2.51)

the zero modes of this solution belong to a (d = 3, n = 8) supermultiplet consisting
of eight scalars and eight spinors (i , i ), with i = 1, ..., 8, which correspond to the eight

25

goldstone bosons and their superpartners associated with breaking of the eight translations

transverse to the membrane worldvolume.

a straightforward generalization to exact, stable multimembrane congurations can be

obtained by replacing the single membrane expression (2.45) by a linear superposition

ec = 1 +xl

6

bl

|y  yl|6

(2.52)

where yl corresponds to the position of each brane, each with charge bl

6. the ability to

superpose solutions of this kind is a well-known phenomenon in soliton and instanton physics

and goes by the name of the no-static-force condition. in the present context, it means

that the gravitational attractive force acting on each of the branes is exactly cancelled by

an equal but repulsive force due to the 3-form. this condition is closely related to the

saturation of the bps bound and to the existence of unbroken supersymmetry. in the case

that n branes with the same charge are stacked together, we have

or in terms of the schwarzschild-like coordinate r given by

ec = 1 +

n b6
y6

we have

r6 = y6 + n b6

ec = 1 

n b6
r6

(2.53)

(2.54)

(2.55)

and the solution exhibits an event-horizon at r = n 1/6b.

indeed the solution may be

analytically continued down to r = 0 where there is a curvature singularity, albeit hidden
by the event horizon [65]. of particular interest is now the near horizon limit y  0, or
equivalently the large n limit, because then the metric reduces to [64, 65, 66] the ads4 s7
vacuum of section 2.2 with

thus

l6 = n b6

ds2 =

y4
l4 dxdx +

l2
y2 dy2 + l2d7

2

(2.56)

(2.57)

which is just ads4  s7 with the ads metric written in horospherical coordinates.

2.5 ads7 s4
in this section, we are interested in obtaining a seven-dimensional theory which admits
maximal ads spacetime symmetry. with signature ( + + + + + +), this means that the

26

vacuum should be invariant under so(6, 2). we again look for solutions of the direct product
form m7  m4 compatible with maximal spacetime symmetry. we denote the spacetime
coordinates by x, ( = 0, . . . , 6) and the internal coordinates by ym, (m = 1, . . . , 4). the

ansatz of freund and rubin [15] is to set

f4 = 3l24

(2.58)

with all other components vanishing, where l is a real constant. here 4 is the volume

form on the internal manifold. as before, l is just an arbitrary constant of integration,

but in section 2.6 we shall relate it to the tension of an m 5-brane. substituting into the

eld equations we nd that (2.2) is trivially satised while (2.1) yields the product of a

seven-dimensional einstein spacetime

r = 

3
2l2 g

with signature ( + + + + + +) and four-dimensional einstein space

with signature (+ + ++).

rmn =

3
l2 gmn

(2.59)

(2.60)

the maximally spacetime symmetric solution of (2.59) is ads7. in these lectures, we
shall focus also on the maximally symmetric round s4 solution of (2.60). the kaluza-

klein mechanism will give rise to an eective d = 7 theory with n = 4 supersymmetry

and local so(5) invariance, describing a massless n = 4 multiplet coupled to an innite

tower of massive n = 4 supermultiplets with masses quantized in units of 2a, the inverse
radius of s4. combining the internal so(5) symmetry and n = 4 supersymmetry with the
so(6, 2) of the ads7 spacetime, it is readily seen that the complete symmetry is osp(6, 2|4).
it follows without any further calculation that the massless sector on s7 is given by the

massless n = 4 supergravity supermultiplet, and there indeed exists a consistent truncation

to the massless sector [223, 224].

2.6 the supervebrane solution

the supervebrane was discovered as a soliton solution of d = 11 supergravity also preserv-

ing half the spacetime supersymmetry [62]. now we make the six/ve split xm = (x, ym)

where  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and m = 6, ..., 10 and proceed in a way similar to the supermem-

brane solution. in particular, we again look for solutions preserving supersymmetry but

this time we look for a non-vanishing magnetic charge carried by f4 :

f4 = 3b34

27

(2.61)

the metric is given by

ds2 = (1 + b3/y3)1/3dxdx + (1 + b3/y3)2/3(dy2 + y2d4

2)

(2.62)

where the vebrane mass per unit 5-volume m6, which we identify with the vebrane
tension t6, is related to the constant b3 by

b3 =

211

2m6
34

(2.63)

here 4 is the volume form on s4 and 4 is the volume. this solitonic solution is a non-

singular solution of the source-free equations and carries a topological magnetic charge

p =

1

211zs4

f4 = 211m6

hence the solution saturates the bogomolnyi bound

211m6  p

(2.64)

(2.65)

once again, this is a consequence of the preservation of half the supersymmetries. the soli-
ton zero modes are described by the chiral antisymmetric tensor multiplet (b , i , [ij]).

note that in addition to the ve scalars corresponding to the ve translational goldstone

bosons, there is also a 2-form b whose 3-form eld strength is anti-self-dual and which

describes three degrees of freedom.

the electric and magnetic charges obey a dirac quantization rule

or, in terms of the tensions,

qp = 2n

n = integer

211

2t3t6 = 2n

(2.66)

(2.67)

this naturally suggests a d = 11 membrane/vebrane duality. note that this reduces the

three dimensionful parameters t3, t6 and 11 down to two. moreover, it can be shown [99]

that they are not independent. to see this, we note from appendix c that a3 has period

2/t3 so that f4 is quantized according to

z f4 =

2n
t3

n = integer

(2.68)

consistency of such a3 periods with the spacetime action, (a.1), gives the relation

(2)2
2t 3
11

3  2z

28

(2.69)

from (2.67), this may also be written as

t6
2  z
t3

thus the tension of the singly charged vebrane is given by

t6 =

2

2

t3

(2.70)

(2.71)

in problem 3.4, you are asked to show that a derivation [101] based on m/iib duality gives

the same result [220].

as for the membrane, multivebrane solutions may be obtained by superposition. if we

again consider n singly charged vebranes stacked one upon the other, we nd in the near
horizon, or large n , limit the ads7  s4 geometry with

l3 = n b3

1. derive the bosonic eld equations (2.1) and (2.2) by varying the d = 11 supergravity

action (a.1).

2. prove that the d = 11 supervebrane preserves one half of the supersymmetry.

3 type iib supergravity

3.1 bosonic eld equations

next we consider type iib supergravity in d = 10 [21, 22] which also describes 128 + 128

degrees of freedom, and corresponds to the eld-theory limit of the type iib superstring.

the spectrum of the supergravity theory consists of a complex scalar b, a complex spinor

, a complex 2-form am n , a complex weyl gravitino m , a real graviton em

r and a real

4-form am n p q whose 5-form eld strength fm n p qr obeys a self-duality condition. owing

to this self-duality , there exists no covariant action principle and it is therefore simplest

to work directly with the eld equations. once again, it is convenient to isolate just the

bosonic eld equations following from appendix b which read

3.2 ads5 s5
in this section, we are interested in obtaining a ve-dimensional theory which admits max-
imal ads spacetime symmetry. with signature ( + + + +), this means that the vacuum
should be invariant under so(4, 2). we again look for solutions of the direct product form
m5  m5 compatible with maximal spacetime symmetry. we denote the spacetime coordi-
nates by x, ( = 0, . . . , 4) and the internal coordinates by ym, (m = 1, . . . , 5). the ansatz

of freund and rubin [15] is to set

and

f5 = g5 + g5

g5 = 4l45

(3.11)

(3.12)

with all other components vanishing, where l is a real constant. here 5 is the volume

form on the internal manifold. as before, l is just an arbitrary constant of integration,

but in section 3.3, we shall relate it to the tension of an d3-brane. substituting into the

eld equations we nd that (2.2) is trivially satised while (2.1) yields the product of a

ve-dimensional einstein spacetime

(3.13)

with signature ( + + + +) and ve-dimensional einstein space

rmn =

(3.14)

with signature (+ + + + +).

the maximally spacetime symmetric solution of (3.13) is ads5. in these lectures, we
shall focus also on the maximally symmetric round s5 solution of (3.14). the kaluza-

klein mechanism will give rise to an eective d = 5 theory with n = 8 supersymmetry

and local so(6) invariance, describing a massless n = 8 multiplet coupled to an innite

tower of massive n = 8 supermultiplets with masses quantized in units of a, the inverse
radius of s5. combining the internal so(6) symmetry and n = 8 supersymmetry with the
so(2, 4) of the ads5 spacetime, it is readily seen that the complete symmetry is su (2, 2|4).
it follows without any further calculation that the massless sector on s5 is given by the

massless n = 8 supergravity supermultiplet. to date, however, the proof of a complete

consistent truncation to the massless sector is still lacking.

3.3 the self-dual superthreebrane solution

the resulting eld equations admit as a solution the self-dual threebrane [57] which in the

extremal limit preserves half the supersymmetry [58] just like the extremal 2-brane and

5-brane of d = 11 supergravity. we need keep only the graviton, dilaton and 4-form and
make the four/six split xm = (x, ym) where  = 0, 1, 2, 3 and m = 5, . . . , 10. the solution

is given by

where

ds2 = (1 + b4/y4)1/2dxdx + (1 + b4/y4)1/2(dy2 + y2d5

e2 = e20 = constant

f5 = g5 + g5

g5 = 4b45

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

here we have employed the string frame metric gm n (string) = e/2gm n (einstein). the
threebrane mass per unit volume m4 is then related to the tension t4 by [7]

and related to the constant k4 by

m4 = e0t4

b4 =

210

31

(3.19)

(3.20)

it is perhaps worth saying a few more words about the self-duality of the superthreebrane.

by virtue of the self-duality condition (3.5), the electric noether charge

q =

1

210zs5  f5

coincides with the topological magnetic charge

so

and hence

p =

210zs5

f5

q = p

10m4

2 = 2n

(3.21)

(3.22)

(3.23)

(3.24)

(note that such a condition is possible only in theories allowing a real self-duality condition

i.e.

in d = 2 modulo 4 dimensions, assuming minkowski signature. the d = 6 self-dual

string of [72] is another example.)

we can also count bosonic and fermionic zero modes. we know that one half of the

supersymmetries are broken, hence we have 16 fermionic zero modes. regrouping these 16

fermionic zero modes, we get four majorana spinors in d = 4. hence the d = 4 worldvol-

ume supersymmetry is n = 4. worldvolume supersymmetry implies that the number of

fermionic and bosonic on-shell degrees of freedom must be equal, so we need a total of eight

bosonic zero modes. there are the usual six bosonic translation zero modes, but we are

still short of two. the two extra zero modes come from the excitation of the complex an-

tisymmetric eld strength gm n p and correspond to a real vector eld on the worldvolume

[58]. together with the other zero modes, these elds make up the d = 4, n = 4 gauge
supermultiplet (a, i , [ij]).

as for the membrane and vebrane, multithreebrane solutions may be obtained by

if we again consider n singly charged threebranes stacked one upon the

superposition.
other, we nd in the near horizon, or large n , limit the ads7  s4 geometry with

l4 = n b4

2. write down the dictionary that relates the elds of m -theory on t 2 to iib on s1.

4 the m2-brane, d3-brane and m5-brane

4.1 the m2-brane

the 8 + 8 zero modes of the m 2-brane are described by a supersymmetric 2+1 dimensional

worldvolume action. however, this obscures the underlying d = 11 spacetime supersymme-

try. it is possible to construct a covariant action with the scalars and spinors being given by
the 11 bosonic coordinates xm and the 32 fermionic coordinates  of a d = 11 superspace

[41, 42]. indeed, in the case of the m 2 brane this came rst. the 8 + 8 physical degrees of

freedom, and the worldvolume supersymmetry then emerge by going to a physical gauge,

as discussed in section 5.2. we begin with the bosonic sector of the d = 3 worldvolume of

the d = 11 supermembrane which follows from appendix c:

where t3 is the membrane tension, i (i = 0, 1, 2) are the worldvolume coordinates, ij
is the worldvolume metric and xm () are the spacetime coordinates (m = 0, 1, . . . , 10).

kappa symmetry, discussed in appendix c, demands that the background metric gm n and

background 3-form potential am n p obey the classical eld equations of d = 11 supergravity

(2.1) and (2.2).

varying (4.1) with respect to xm yields

while varying with respect to ij yields the embedding equation

(4.2)

(4.3)

an important issue is the existence of membrane congurations preserving some super-

symmetry [44, 45]. we usually seek supersymmetric membrane vacuum states for which

33

both the spacetime gravitino m and the fermionic coordinates () are zero, so that the

membrane action reduces to (4.1). in this case, the criterion for surviving supersymmetry

is that the vacuum expectation values of m and () remain zero under some appropriate

combination of  symmetry and supersymmetry transformations. we shall work to linear

order in fermions, which is as high as we need go to investigate the supersymmetry of a

purely bosonic background. from appendices a and c, these transformations rules are

m = dm (x)

 = (1 + )() + (x)

(4.4)

(4.5)

where  and  are the supersymmetry and  symmetry parameters, respectively. here dm
is the d = 11 supercovariant derivative (2.36) and  is given by

 =

1
3!

ijkixm jxn kxp m n p

(4.6)

as a consequence of the embedding equation (4.3),  satises 2 = 1. since  is tracefree,
this implies that (1  )/2 are projection operators with 16 zero eigenvalues. irrespective
of the background geometry the  symmetry may therefore be used to set 16 of the 32

components of  to zero. a convenient choice is

(1 + ) = 0

(4.7)

acting with (4.5), we see that around a purely bosonic background, (4.7) is preserved if

(1 + ) = 0, i.e., combined  and  transformations for which

2(1 + ) + (1 + ) = 0

(4.8)

which implies that  = (1  )/2. thus a bosonic vacuum has residual supersymmetries
corresponding to solutions of [44, 45]

dm  = 0,

(x) = (x)

(4.9)

we shall make use of this in seeking the membrane at the end of the universe in section

5.4.

4.2 the m5-brane

the bosonic m 5 worldvolume equations of motion follow from appendix d. we work

with equations of motion rather than an action because of the appearance of a self-dual

worldvolume 3-form eld strength habc.

where fij are the components of a modied 2-form eld strength

f = f  b ,

(4.29)

where f = dv is the usual eld strength 2-form of the born-infeld eld v and b is the

pullback to the worldvolume of the ns-ns type iib 2-form potential b, and where a0, a2

and a4 are the r-r forms. we use the same letter for superspace forms and their pullbacks

to the worldvolume.

4.4 problems 4

1. show that the equations for the bosonic sector of the type iia superstring in d = 10
follow from those of the supermembrane in d = 11 by assuming an m10s1 topology,
wrapping the membrane around the s1 and taking the small radius limit [44].

5 ads/cft : the membrane at the end of the

universe

5.1 singletons live on the boundary

as emphasized by fronsdal et al.

[30, 31], singletons are best thought of as living not

in the (d + 1)-dimensional bulk of the adsd+1 spacetime but rather on the d-dimensional
s1  sd1 boundary where the ads group so(d  1, 2) plays the role of the conformal
group. remaining for the moment with our 4-dimensional example, consider a scalar eld

(t, r, , ) on ads4 with metric (2.33), described by the action

sbulk =zads4

d4xg

hg  m 2i 

(5.1)

note that this diers from the conventional klein-gordon action by a boundary term. since
the scalar laplacian on ads4 has eigenvalues e0(e0  3)a2, the critical value of m 2 for a
singleton with (e0, s) = (1/2, 0) is

a2

in this case, one can show with some eort [30, 31] that as r  ,

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

this 3-manifold is sometimes referred to as the boundary of ads4 but note that the metric
hij is not obtained by taking the r   limit of g but rather the r   limit of the
conformally rescaled metric 2g where  = 1/ar. the radius of the s2 is a1, not innity.

most particle physicists are familiar with the conformal group in at minkowski space. it is

the group of coordinate transformations which leave invariant the minkowski lightcone. in

the case of three-dimensional minkowski space, m3, it is so(3, 2). in the present context,
however, the spacetime is curved with topology s1  s2, but still admits so(3, 2) as its
conformal group8, i.e. as the group which leaves invariant the three-dimensional lightcone
hijdidj = 0. the failure to discriminate between these dierent kinds of conformal invari-
ance is, we believe, a source of confusion in the singleton literature. in particular, the 2

mass term appearing in the action (5.4) would be incompatible with conformal invariance
if the action were on m3 but is essential for conformal invariance on s1  s2. moreover, the
coecient a2/8 is uniquely xed [39]. in section 5.4 we shall derive the singleton action
(5.4) including the scalar mass terms, starting from the membrane action (4.1).

so although singleton actions of the form (5.1) and their superpartners appeared in
the kaluza-klein harmonic expansions on ads4  s7 [34, 35, 36], they could be gauged
away everywhere except on the boundary where the above osp(4|8) corresponds to the
superconformal group [37]. one nds an (n = 8, d = 3) supermultiplet with 8 scalars a
and 8 spinors  a, where the indices a and a range over 1 to 8 and denote the 8s and 8c
representations of so(8), respectively. the osp(4|8) action is a generalization of (5.4) and
is given by [39]

5.2 the membrane as a singleton: the membrane/supergravity bootstrap

being dened over the boundary of ads4, the osp(4|8) singleton action (5.6) is a three
dimensional theory with signature (, +, +) describing 8 scalars and 8 spinors. with the
discovery of the eleven-dimensional supermembrane [41, 42], it was noted that 8 scalars
and 8 spinors on a three-dimensional worldvolume with signature (, +, +) is just what
is obtained after gauge-xing the supermembrane action! moreover, kappa-symmetry of

this supermembrane action forces the background elds to obey the eld equations of
it was therefore suggested [38] that on the ads4  s7
(n = 1, d = 11) supergravity.
supergravity background, the supermembrane whose worldvolume occupies the s1  s2
boundary of the ads4 could be regarded as the singleton of osp(4|8) . noting that these
singletons also appear in the kaluza-klein harmonic expansion of this supergravity back-

ground, this further suggested a form of bootstrap [38] in which the supergravity gives rise

39

to the membrane on the boundary which in turn yields the supergravity in the bulk. this

conjecture received further support with the subsequent discovery of the membrane at the

end of the universe [38, 44, 39, 45, 46] to be discussed in section 5.4, and the realisa-

tion [51] that the eleven-dimensional supermembrane emerges as a solution of the d = 11

supergravity eld equations.

the possibility of a similar 3-brane/supergravity bootstrap arising for the su (2, 2|4)
doubletons on ads5  s5 and a similar 5-brane/supergravity bootstrap arising for the
osp(6, 2|4) tripletons on ads7  s4 was also considered [38]. ironically, however, it was
(erroneously as we now know) rejected since the only supermembranes that were known

at the time [52] had worldvolume theories described by scalar supermultiplets, whereas

the doubletons and tripletons required vector and tensor supermultiplets, respectively. see

section 5.3.

nevertheless, since everything seemed to t nicely for the (d = 3, d = 11) slot on

the brane-scan of supersymmetric extended objects with worldvolume dimension d, there

followed a good deal of activity relating other super p-branes in other dimensions to sin-

gletons and superconformal eld theories [44, 45, 39, 47, 48, 43, 49, 40, 50]. in particular,

it was pointed out [39, 40, 48] that there was a one-to one-correspondence between the

12 points on the brane-scan as it was then known [52] and the 12 superconformal groups

in nahms classication [37] admitting singleton representations, as shown in table 5. to

understand these 12 points on the brane-scan, we recall the matching of physical bose and

fermi degrees of freedom on the worldvolume. as the p-brane moves through spacetime, its
trajectory is described by the functions xm () where xm are the spacetime coordinates
(m = 0, 1, . . . , d  1) and i are the worldvolume coordinates (i = 0, 1, . . . , d  1). it is
often convenient to make the so-called static gauge choice by making the d = d + (d  d)
split

xm () = (x (), y m()),

where  = 0, 1, . . . , d  1 and m = d, . . . , d  1, and then setting

x () = .

(5.9)

(5.10)

thus the only physical worldvolume degrees of freedom are given by the (d  d) y m(). so
the number of on-shell bosonic degrees of freedom is

to describe the super p-brane we augment the d bosonic coordinates xm () with anticom-
muting fermionic coordinates (). depending on d, this spinor could be dirac, weyl,

nb = d  d.

(5.11)

40

majorana or majorana-weyl. the fermionic kappa symmetry means that half of the spinor

degrees of freedom are redundant and may be eliminated by a physical gauge choice. the

net result is that the theory exhibits a d-dimensional worldvolume supersymmetry where

the number of fermionic generators is exactly half of the generators in the original space-

time supersymmetry. this partial breaking of supersymmetry is a key idea. let m be the

number of real components of the minimal spinor and n the number of supersymmetries in

d spacetime dimensions and let m and n be the corresponding quantities in d worldvolume

dimensions. let us rst consider d > 2. since kappa symmetry always halves the number

of fermionic degrees of freedom and going on-shell halves it again, the number of on-shell

fermionic degrees of freedom is

nf =

1
2

mn =

1
4

m n.

worldvolume supersymmetry demands nb = nf and hence

d  d =

1
2

mn =

1
4

m n.

(5.12)

(5.13)

a list of dimensions, number of real dimensions of the minimal spinor and possible super-

symmetries is given in table 2, from which we see that there are only 8 solutions of (5.13)

all with n = 1, which exactly match the singletons shown in table 5. we note in particular
that dmax = 11 since m  64 for d  12 and hence (5.13) cannot be satised. similarly
dmax = 6 since m  16 for d  7. the case d = 2 is special because of the ability to treat
left and right moving modes independently. if we require the sum of both left and right

moving bosons and fermions to be equal, then we again nd the condition (5.13). this

provides a further 4 solutions all with n = 2, corresponding to type ii superstrings in

d = 3, 4, 6 and 10 (or 8 solutions in all if we treat type iia and type iib separately).

both the gauge-xed type iia and type iib superstrings will display (8, 8) supersymme-

try on the worldsheet. if we require only left (or right) matching, then (5.13) is replaced

by

d  2 = n =

1
2

m n,

(5.14)

which allows another 4 solutions in d = 3, 4, 6 and 10, all with n = 1. the gauge-xed

theory will display (8, 0) worldsheet supersymmetry. the heterotic string falls into this

category.

the number of dimensions transverse to the brane, d  d, equals the number of scalars
in the singleton supermultiplet. (the two factors appearing in the d = 2 case is simply a

reection of the ability of strings to have right and left movers. for brevity, we have written

the type ii assignments in table 5, but more generally we could have osp(2|p) osp(2|q)
where p and q are the number of left and right supersymmetries [53].) note that the d = 6

upper limit on the worldvolume dimension is consistent with the requirement of renormal-
izability [47]. note, however, that the (d = 3, d = 11), osp(4|8) slot (written in boldface)
occupies a privileged position in that the corresponding d = 11 supergravity theory admits
the ads4  s7 solution with osp(4|8) symmetry, whereas the other supergravities do not
admit solutions with the superconformal group as a symmetry. for example, d = 10 su-
pergravity admits an ads3  s7 solution [54, 65], but it does not have the full [osp(2|8)]2
symmetry because the dilaton is non-trivial and acts as a conformal killing vector on the

ads3. this is slightly mysterious, since the bulk theory has less symmetry than the bound-

ary theory. we shall return to this in sections 5.5 and 5.7.

5.3 doubletons and tripletons revisited

these early works focussed on scalar supermultiplets because these were the only p-branes

known in 1988 [52]. however, with the discovery in 1990 of type ii p-brane solitons

[59, 60, 57, 58, 61], vector and tensor multiplets were also seen to play a role. in particular,

table 6: the brane scan of superconformal groups admitting doubletons

the worldvolume elds of the self-dual type iib superthreebrane were shown to be described

by an (n = 4, d = 4) gauge theory [58], which on the boundary of ads5 is just the doubleton
supermultiplet of the superconformal group su (2, 2|4)! thus one can after all entertain a
3-brane-doubleton-supergravity bootstrap similar to the membrane-singleton-supergravity

bootstrap of section 5.2, and we may now draw the doubleton brane scan of table 6. once

again, the restriction to d = 4 is consistent with renormalizability. note, however, that
the (d = 4, d = 10), su (2, 2|4) slot (written in boldface) occupies a privileged position
in that the corresponding d = 10 type iib supergravity admits the ads5  s5 solution
with su (2, 2|4) symmetry, whereas the other supergravities do not admit solutions with
the superconformal group as a symmetry since, as discussed in section 5.5, the dilaton is

again non-trivial.

similarly, with the discovery of the m -theory vebrane [62], it was realized [64] that the
zero modes are described by an ((n+, n) = (2, 0), d = 6) multiplet with a chiral 2-form, 8
spinors and 5 scalars, which on the boundary of ads7 is just the tripleton supermultiplet
of the superconformal group osp(6, 2|4)! (these zero modes are the same as those of the
type iia vebrane, found previously in [59, 60]). thus one can after all also entertain

table 7: the brane scan of superconformal groups admitting tripletons

a 5-brane-tripleton-supergravity bootstrap similar to the membrane-singleton-supergravity

bootstrap of section 5.2. thus we may now draw the tripleton brane scan of table 7.
note once again, however, that the (d = 6, d = 11), osp(6, 2|4) slot (written in boldface)
occupies a privileged position in that the corresponding d = 11 supergravity admits the
ads7  s4 solution with osp(6, 2|4) symmetry, whereas the other supergravities do not
admit solutions with the superconformal group as a symmetry since, as discussed in section

5.5, the dilaton is again non-trivial.

with the inclusion of branes with vector and tensor supermultiplets on their worldvol-

ume, another curiosity arises. whereas the singleton brane scan of table 5 exhausts all the

scalar branes and the tripleton brane scan of table 7 exhausts all the tensor branes, the

doubleton brane scan of table 6 is only a subset of all the vector branes [55]. the type

iib 3-brane is special because gauge theories are conformal only in d = 4.

5.4 the membrane at the end of the universe

as further evidence of the membrane/supergravity bootstrap idea, solutions of the d = 11
supermembrane equations (4.2) and (4.3) were sought for which the spacetime is ads4m 7

44

and for which the supermembrane occupies the s1  s2 boundary of the ads4. as we shall
now recall, the bps condition was achieved only as r  , hence the name the membrane
at the end of the universe [44, 45, 78, 46].

we substitute (2.19) and (2.5) into (4.2) and (4.3) and look for solutions of the form

t = 0,

 = 1,

 = 2

(5.15)

so that the membrane is embedded in the ads4 as

ds2

4 =  cosh2 (d0)2 +

1
a2 d2 +

1
a2 sinh2 ((d1)2 + sin2 1(d2)2)

(5.16)

in order to show that this conguration does indeed satisfy the requirements of unbroken
supersymmetry (4.9), we rst exhibit a spinor  satisfying dm  = 0 everywhere and then
show how it satises  =  as r  . it is not dicult to show that

 =   i

(5.17)

where   012. first we look for spinors of the form (2.39), then the general solution for
(x) is

 = 2(sinh /2 +  cosh /2)(t, , )

(5.18)

(5.19)

where  satises

(1 + )(i +

1
2

ai3) = 0

where i is the covariant derivative on the s1  s2 boundary of ads4 with metric (5.5).
one can show [44] that this equation has four solutions, implying the well-known result

that ads4 has four killing spinors.

since r =  corresponds to  = , it follows from (5.18), (5.17) that  becomes an
eigenstate of  and hence  =  at the end of the universe. thus we have shown that

the membrane at the end of the universe is supersymmetric whenever m7 admits killing

spinors. as we have seen in section 2.2, the number n of such spinors depends on the weyl

holonomy of m7 and lies between 0 and 8. it remains to show that the action for such a
membrane is indeed the osp(4|n ) singleton action (5.6). to simplify matters we shall now
demonstrate this for the bosonic radial mode r(). substituting the ads4  m7 solution
and the brane ansatz (5.15) into the membrane action (4.1) we nd

following [141], this result may be generalized to arbitrary (d 1)-branes occupying the
conformal boundary m of an arbitrary einstein (d + 1)-dimensional manifold w . we shall

adapt the notation and the signature used in [141] for our convenience. the boundary m

has a natural conformal structure but not a natural metric. let hij be an arbitrary metric
on the boundary in its conformal class. here the i, i = 0, . . . , d  1 are an arbitrary set
of local coordinates on the boundary. there is then a unique way [199] to extend the i

to coordinates on w near the boundary, adding an additional coordinate  that tends to

innity on the boundary, such that the metric in a neighborhood of the boundary is

5.5 near horizon geometry and p-brane aristocracy

more recently, ads has emerged as the near-horizon geometry of black p-brane solutions
[64, 65, 66, 7] in d dimensions. the dual brane, with worldvolume dimension d = d d 2,
interpolates between d-dimensional minkowski space md and ads d+1sd+1 (or m d+1s3
if d = 2). to see this, we recall that such branes arise generically as solitons of the following

action [72]:

thus for d 6= 2 the near-horizon geometry is ads d+1  sd+1. note, however, that the
gradient of the dilaton is generically non-zero and plays the role of a conformal killing

vector on ads d+1. consequently, there is no enhancement of symmetry in the near-horizon

which is m d+1  s3, with a linear dilaton vacuum. the bosonic symmetry remains p d 
so(4).)

of particular interest are the ( = 0) subset of solitons for which the dilaton is zero or

constant: the non-dilatonic p-branes. from (5.31) we see that for branes with one kind of

charge there are only 3 cases:

d = 11 : d = 6, d = 3

d = 10 : d = 4, d = 4

d = 11 : d = 3, d = 6

which are precisely the three cases that occupied privileged positions on the singleton,

doubleton and tripleton brane-scans of tables 5, 6 and 7. then the near-horizon geometry
coincides with the ads d+1  sd+1 non-dilatonic maximally symmetric compactications of
the corresponding supergravities. the supersymmetry doubles and the bosonic symmetry is
also enhanced to so( d, 2)  so(d + 2). thus the total symmetry is given by the conformal
supergroups osp(4|8), su (2, 2|4) and osp(6, 2|4), respectively.

for bound states of branes with m kinds of charge, the constant  gets replaced by

[76, 73, 74]

(5.38)

a non-dilatonic solution (=0) occurs for m = 2:

d = 6 : d = 2, d = 2

which is just the dyonic string [75], of which the self-dual string [72] is a special case, whose
near-horizon geometry is ads3  s3. for m = 3 we have
d = 5 : d = 2, d = 1

which is the 3-charge black hole [80], whose near-horizon geometry is ads2  s3, and

d = 5 : d = 1, d = 2

48

which is the 3-charge string [80] whose near-horizon geometry is ads3  s2. for m = 4 we
have

d = 4 : d = 1, d = 1

which is the 4-charge black hole [81, 82], of which the reissner-nordstrom solution is a
special case [76], and whose near-horizon geometry is ads2  s2 [77].

thus we see that not all branes are created equal. a p-brane aristocracy obtains whose

members are those branes whose near-horizon geometries have as their symmetry the con-

formal supergroups. as an example of a plebian brane we can consider the ten-dimensional

superstring:

d = 10 : d = 6, d = 2

whose near-horizon geometry is ads3  s7 but with a non-trivial dilaton of section 5.2
which does not have the conformal group [osp(2|8)]2 as its symmetry, even though this
group appears in the (d = 10, d = 2) slot on the singleton brane-scan of table 5. in which

case, of course, one may ask what role do these singletons play. we shall return to this in

section 5.7.

the original membrane at the end of the universe was a spherical brane embedded in

the ads4 geometry as given in 5.4. alternatively, one could take as the membrane at the

end of the universe to be the at near-horizon membrane, which is embedded as

ds2 = e4/l((d0)2 + (d1)2 + (d2)2) + d 2

(5.39)

and has m3 topology. it is still possible to associate an osp(4|8) action but this time it is
dened over m3 and has no scalar mass terms [78, 79]. one can continue to call these elds

singletons, of course, if by singleton one simply means anything transforming according

to the d(1/2, 0) and d(1, 1/2) representations of so(3, 2). a comparison of these two

approaches is discussed in some detail in [78].

5.6 supermembranes with fewer supersymmetries. skew-whing.

so far we have focussed attention on compactications to ads d+1 on round spheres sd+1
which have maximal supersymmetry, but the supergravity equations admit innitely many
other compactications on einstein spaces x d+1 which have fewer supersymmetries [20].
indeed generic x d+1 have no supersymmetries at all9. we note in this connection the

9thus in the early eighties, the most highly prized solutions were those with many supersymmetries.

nowadays, bragging rights seem to go those which have none!

49

skew-whing theorem [20], which states that for every ads d+1 compactication preserv-
ing supersymmetry, there exists one with no supersymmetry simply obtained by reversing
the orientation of x d+1 (or, equivalently, reversing the sign of fd+1). the only excep-
tions are when x d+1 are round spheres which preserve the maximum supersymmetry for

either orientation. a corollary is that other symmetric spaces, which necessarily admit an

orientation-reversing isometry, can have no supersymmeties. examples are provided by

products of round spheres.

the question naturally arises as to whether these compactications with fewer super-

symmetries also arise as near-horizon geometries of p-brane solitons. the answer is yes and

the soliton solutions are easy to construct [67, 68]. one simply makes the replacement

dd+1

2  d d+1

(5.40)

2 is the metric on an arbitrary einstein space x d+1 with the same

in (5.32), where d d+1
scalar curvature as the round sd+1. the space need only be einstein;
it need not be
homogeneous [67]. (there also exist brane solutions on ricci at x d+1 [67] but we shall not

discuss them here). note, however, that these non-round-spherical solutions do not tend
to (d  d)-dimensional minkowski space as r  . instead the metric on the (d  d)-
dimensional space transverse to the brane is asymptotic to a generalized cone

2 = dr2 + r2d d+1

dsd d

2

(5.41)

and (d  d)-dimensional translational invariance is absent except when x d+1 is a round
sphere. the number of supersymmetries preserved by these p-branes is determined by the
number of killing spinors on x d+1.

to illustrate these ideas let us focus on the eleven-dimensional supermembrane. the
usual supermembrane interpolates between m11 and ads4 round s7, has symmetry p3 
so(8) and preserves 1/2 of the spacetime supersymmetries for either orientation of the
round s7. replacing the round s7 by generic einstein spaces x 7 leads to membranes with
symmetry p3  g, where g is the isometry group of x 7. for example g = so(5)  so(3)
for the squashed s7 [69, 70]. for one orientation of x 7, they preserve n/16 spacetime
supersymmetries where 1  n  8 is the number of killing spinors on x 7; for the opposite
orientation they preserve no supersymmetries since then x 7 has no killing spinors. for
example, n = 1 for the left-squashed s7 owing to its g2 holonomy [69, 20, 70], whereas
n = 0 for the right-squashed s7. however, all these solutions satisfy the same bogomolnyi

bound between the mass and charge as the usual supermembrane [67]. of course, skew-

whing is not the only way to obtain vacua with less than maximal supersymmetry. a

50

summary of known x 7, their supersymmetries and stability properties is given in [20].

note, however, that skew-whied vacua are automatically stable at the classical level since

skew-whing aects only the spin 3/2, 1/2 and 0 towers in the kaluza-klein spectrum,
whereas the criterion for classical stability involves only the 0+ tower [20].

5.7 the maldacena conjecture

the year 1998 marks a revolution in anti-de sitter space brought about by maldacenas

conjectured duality between physics in the bulk of ads and a conformal eld theory on
the boundary [111]. in particular, m -theory on ads4  s7 is dual to a non-abelian (n =
8, d = 3) superconformal theory, type iib string theory on ads5  s5 is dual to a d = 4
su (n ) super yang-mills theory theory and m -theory on ads7s4 is dual to a non-abelian
((n+, n) = (2, 0), d = 6) conformal theory. in particular, as has been spelled out most
clearly in the d = 4 su (n ) yang-mills case, there is seen to be a correspondence between

the kaluza-klein mass spectrum in the bulk and the conformal dimension of operators on

the boundary [123, 125].

one immediately recognises that the dimensions and supersymmetries of these three

conformal theories are exactly the same as the singleton, doubleton and tripleton super-

multiplets of section 5. moreover, both the old and new ads/cf t correspondences are

holographic in the sense of [131, 132]. following maldacenas conjecture [111], therefore, a

number of papers appeared reviving the old singleton-ads-membrane- superconformal eld

theory connections [119, 120, 121, 78, 118, 122, 123, 124, 125, 156, 84, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130]

and applying them to this new duality context. what are the dierences?

the rst dierence is that the branes were spherical as opposed to at, since the bound-
ary in question for the singletons and p-branes at the end of the universe was the s1  sp
with nite radius 1/a for the sp. as such, superconformal invariance requires mass terms

for the scalars, as discussed in section 5.1. the branes in the maldacena conjecture, on the

other hand, are the at minkowski space branes embedded in ads in the way dictated by

the near-horizon geometry.

another curious dierence is that, with the exception of the three aristocratic branes,

all the slots on the three brane-scans of superconformal eld theories corresponded to bulk

supergravities whose brane solutions are dilatonic, and hence have a symmetry smaller than

the boundary theory. it seems that the branes at the end of the universe do not care about

the dilaton because the  =constant surfaces in (5.16) (or the  = constant surfaces in

(5.39)) posess the full superconformal symmetry even though the bulk ads solution does

51

not. in other words, they admit the maximal set of conformal killing vectors even though

the bulk admits less than the maximal set of killing vectors. this contrasts with the

new ads/cf t conjecture where a non-conformal supergravity solution in the bulk [65] is

deemed to be dual to non-conformal eld theory on the boundary [118]. it is not obvious

at the moment whether this dierence is real or apparent and it would be interesting to

pursue the matter further.

thirdly, although the membrane/supergravity bootstrap idea, that physics in the bulk

of ads should be dictated by the membrane on the boundary and vice-versa, might nowa-

days be called holographic, it was not motivated by considerations of entropy. rather,

in analogy with string theory where there are self-consistency requirements between the

spacetime and worldsheet dynamics, it was expected that a similar phenomenon should

hold for membranes and the membrane on the boundary of ads was simply a special case.

fourthly, attention was focussed on free superconformal theories on the boundary as

opposed to the interacting theories currently under consideration. for example, although the

worldvolume elds of the type iib 3-brane were known to be described by an (n = 4, d = 4)

gauge theory [58], we now know that this brane admits the interpretation of a dirichlet brane

[112] and that the superposition of n such branes yields a non-abelian su (n ) gauge theory

[113]. these observations are crucial to the new duality conjecture [111]. for earlier related

work on coincident threebranes and n = 4 super yang mills, see [114, 115, 116, 117].

let us consider the solution for n coincident 3-branes corresponding to n units of 5-
form ux [57, 58]. as we have already seen in section 3.2, l = n 1/4b and the near horizon
limit may equally well be regarded as the large n limit. we nd ads5  s5, but with an
ads radius proportional to n 1/4. the philosophy is that type iib supergravity is a good

approximation for large n and that type iib stringy excitations correspond to operators
whose dimensions diverge for n  . this makes contact with the whole industry of
large n qcd. these large n , non-abelian features were absent in the considerations of a

3-brane/supergravity bootstrap discussed in section 5.3, as was the precise correspondence

between the kaluza-klein mass spectrum in the bulk and the conformal dimension of op-

erators on the boundary [123, 125]. nevertheless, as we hope these lectures show, there

are sucently many similarities between the current bulk/boundary duality and the old

membrane at the end of the universe idea to merit further comparisons.

6 anti-de sitter black holes

6.1

introduction

anti-de sitter black hole solutions of gauged extended supergravities [144] are currently

attracting a good deal of attention [145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155] due,

in large part, to the ads/cf t correspondence. as we have seen, these gauged extended

supergravities arise as the massless modes of various kaluza-klein compactications of

both d = 11 and d = 10 supergravities. the three examples studied in these lectures are

gauged d = 4, n = 8 so(8) supergravity [157, 158] arising from d = 11 supergravity on
s7 [159, 20] whose black hole solutions are discussed in [150]; gauged d = 5, n = 8 so(6)
supergravity [18, 27] arising from type iib supergravity on s5 [23, 24, 25] whose black hole

solutions are discussed in [145, 149]; and gauged d = 7, n = 4 so(5) supergravity [18, 19]
arising from d = 11 supergravity on s4 [17] whose black hole solutions are given in section
6.8 and in [152, 63].10 in the absence of the black holes, these three ads compactications

are singled out as arising from the near-horizon geometry of the extremal non-rotating

m 2, d3 and m 5 branes [64, 65, 66, 160]. one of our goals will be to embed these known

lower-dimensional black hole solutions into ten or eleven dimensions, thus allowing a higher

dimensional interpretation in terms of rotating m 2, d3 and m 5-branes.

since these gauged supergravity theories may be obtained by consistently truncating the

massive modes of the full kaluza-klein theories, it follows that all solutions of the lower-

dimensional theories will also be solutions of the higher-dimensional ones [161, 162].

in

principle, therefore, once we know the kaluza-klein ansatz for the massless sector, it ought

to be straightforward to read o the higher dimensional solutions. it practice, however, this
is a formidable task. the correct massless ansatz for the s7 compactication took many
years to nalize [163, 165], and is still highly implicit, while for the s5 compactications
the complete massless ansatze are still unknown. the s4 case has recently been given in

its entirety in [223, 224]. for our present purposes, it suces to consider truncations of

the gauged supergravities to include only gauge elds in the cartan subalgebras of the full
gauge groups, namely u (1)4, u (1)3 and u (1)2 for the s7, s5 and s4 compactications,

respectively. these truncated theories will admit respectively the 4-charge ads4, 3-charge

ads5 and 2-charge ads7 black hole solutions.

10bps black holes arising in the su (2)  su (2) version of gauged n = 4 supergravity in d = 4, which
is the massless sector of the s3  s3 compactication of n = 1 supergravity in d = 10, were discussed in

[148]. these solutions are not asymptotically ads.

53

the simplest of the three is perhaps the d = 5, n = 8 maximal gauged supergravity, for

which there is a consistent n = 2 (i.e. minimal) truncation to supergravity coupled to two

abelian vector multiplets. this has the bosonic eld content of a graviton, three u (1) gauge

elds and two scalars. in these lectures we obtain the complete non-linear kaluza-klein
ansatz for the compactication of d = 10 type iib supergravity on s5, truncated to the
u (1)3 cartan subgroup of so(6).

in four dimensions there is a consistent truncation of gauged n = 8 maximal supergrav-

ity to gauged n = 2 supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets. the bosonic sector

consists of a graviton, four vectors and three complex scalars, whose real and imaginary
parts correspond to three axions and three dilatons. 11. the inclusion of the axions

is necessary for providing a consistent truncation; the full bosonic lagrangian in this case
is obtained in appendix f. this truncation corresponds to the u (1)4 cartan subgroup of

the non-abelian so(8), for which there exist ads black hole solutions with four electric

charges [150]. while one would ideally wish to obtain a complete kaluza-klein ansatz for

the n = 2 truncation, in practice the complexity arising from the inclusion of the axions

is considerable. thus in these lectures we omit the axions in the kaluza-klein reduction.

this is of course sucient for the embedding of the electric black hole solutions in d = 11

as they do not involve the axions.

finally, in seven dimensions, maximal n = 4 gauged so(5) supergravity admits a

consistent truncation to n = 2 supergravity, comprising the metric, a 2-form potential, three

vectors and a dilaton, coupled to a vector multiplet comprising a vector and three scalars.
we obtain the kaluza-klein ansatz for an s4 reduction of d = 11 supergravity, including
two u (1)2 gauge elds and two dilatonic scalars. this is sucient for the consideration of

the embedding of the d = 7 black holes in d = 11.

having obtained the explicit kaluza-klein reduction ansatze, this allows an investigation

of the embedding of the various ads black holes of d = 4, d = 5 and d = 7 in the respective

higher-dimensional supergravities. an important point here is that one must know the exact

kaluza-klein reduction ansatz for the reduction of the supergravity theory itself, and not

11interestingly enough, the ungauged version of this theory, obtained by switching o the gauge coupling
and performing some dualisations, appears in the t 2 compactication of d = 6, n = 1 string theory. the

four vectors are the two kaluza-klein and two winding gauge elds, while the three complex scalars s, t

and u correspond to the axion-dilaton, the kahler form and complex structure of the torus. this st u

system plays a crucial role in four-dimensional string/string/string triality [166]. the black hole solutions

of this theory [167, 166], and their embedding in ungauged n = 8 supergravity [168, 169] arising from the
t 7 compactication of m -theory as intersections [170, 171] are also well known.

54

just for a specic solution, in order to show that the metric, gauge elds and scalar elds of

the lower-dimensional solution are indeed precisely embeddable in the higher-dimensional

theory. it is worth remarking, in this regard, that it is the scalar elds that present most

of the subtleties and complexities in the implementation of the reduction procedure.

having embedded these black holes in ten or eleven dimensions, an interesting question

then arises as to their higher-dimensional interpretation. it was noted some time ago [45],
in the context of a test membrane moving in a xed ads4  s7, that a 4-dimensional
bps state (whose ads energy is equal to its electric charge) admits the eleven-dimensional

interpretation of an m 2-brane [41, 42, 51] that is rotating in the extra dimensions. moreover,

the electric charge is equal to the spin.

recently there has been an upsurge of activities on the study of rotating p-branes

[172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 151, 152, 153, 178, 179, 180, 181].

in particular, in [151]

ads reissner-nordstrom black holes (i.e. the charged black holes without scalars) of ads

supergavity in d = 4 and d = 5 were studied, and shown to be related to the rotating

solutions of m-/string theory. in [152] the near-extreme spinning d3-brane with one an-
gular momentum was shown to reproduce the metric and the gauge elds of the k = 0+

limit of d = 5 gauged supergravity black holes [149], with the anticipation that the result

would generalize to multiple angular momenta. however, the identication of the scalar

elds was not given. in addition, in [152, 153], the equivalence of the thermodynamics of

the near-extreme spinning branes and the corresponding large black holes of d = 4, 5, 7

gauged supergravity was given. while incomplete, these works provided some initial stages

in the investigation of the sphere compactications of m-/string theory.

unlike black holes that are asymptotically minkowskian, for which the horizons are al-

ways spherical, it is known that ads black holes can also admit horizons of more general

topology. following the embedding procedure described above, we demonstrate that the

ads4 black holes with toroidal horizon can indeed be interpreted as the near-horizon struc-

tures of an m 2 brane rotating in the extra dimensions. the four charges corresponding to
the u (1)4 cartan subgroup are just the four angular momenta. similarly, the 5-dimensional

charged black hole with toroidal horizon corresponds to a rotating d3-brane and the 7-

dimensional charged black hole with toroidal horizon to a rotating m 5-brane. in each case,
the event horizon coincides with the worldvolume of the brane.12 additionally, one may use

the kaluza-klein ansatz to obtain the higher-dimensional interpretation of ads black holes

with horizons of other topologies. we conjecture that these correspond to the near-horizon

12this is a concrete realisation of the membrane paradigm [182].

55

limits of rotating p-branes whose world-volumes have these topologies. (in fact the rotating
test membrane in [45] had s2 topology.)

in these lectures we also obtain the general rotating p-brane solutions in arbitrary di-

mensions, supported by a single (p + 2)-form charge, and discuss their sphere reductions.

these rotating p-branes are easily constructed, merely by performing standard diagonal

dimensional oxidations of the general rotating black holes that were constructed in [172].

6.2 s5 reduction of type iib supergravity

the s5 reduction [23, 24, 25] of type iib supergravity gives rise to n = 8, d = 5

gauged supergravity, with so(6) yang-mills gauge group [18, 27]. the complete details

of this reduction, as with any sphere reduction, would be of great complexity, and in fact

no example has ever been fully worked out. for our present purposes, however, it suces

to consider the truncation of the ve-dimensional theory to n = 2 supersymmetry.

in

this truncation, which is of course a consistent one, the gauge group is reduced down to
the u (1)  u (1)  u (1) cartan subgroup of so(6). the bosonic sector of the theory
comprises these three gauge bosons, the metric, and two scalar elds. (the consistency of
the truncation to this eld content can be seen by considering the s1 reduction of ungauged

minimal non-chiral supergravity in d = 6, whose bosonic elds (g , a(2), ) reduce to give

precisely the eld content we are considering here in d = 5. after gauging, one would

obtain the u (1)3 gauged theory.)

even to construct the s5 reduction ansatz for this truncated n = 2 theory is somewhat

non-trivial, owing to the presence of the scalar elds. it is most conveniently expressed in

terms of the parameterisation of sphere metrics given in [183].

we nd that the ansatz for the reduction of the ten-dimensional metric is

thus we have established that the reduction ansatze (6.1) and (6.8) describe the ex-

supergravity.

in this section, we show that the k = 0 three-charge ads black hole of the n = 2 gauged

supergravity in d = 5 given in (6.12) can be embedded in d = 10 as a solution that is

precisely the decoupling limit of the rotating d3-brane. the higher-dimensional solutions
corresponding to ve-dimensional ads black holes with k = 1 and k = 1 can also be easily
obtained, by substituting the ve-dimensional solutions into the s5 reduction ansatze.

there can be three angular momenta, i, i = 1, 2, 3, in the rotating d3-brane. the

generic single-charge rotating p-branes can be obtained by dimensional oxidation of the

generic single-charge rotating black holes constructed in [172]. see problems of section

as is well known, the non-rotating d3-brane has a decoupling limit where the space-

time of the d3-brane becomes a product space m5  s5.
m5 is a ve-dimensional anti-de sitter spacetime. more generally, when the d3-brane is

if the d3-brane is extremal,

non-extremal, m5 is the carter-novotny-horsky metric [184], which can thus be viewed

as a non-extremal generalisation of ads5. a similar limit also exists for the rotating

d3-brane, and can be achieved by making the rescalings

(6.23)

to complete the story, we note that the 5-form eld strength in the decoupling limit is given
by f(5) = g(5) + g(5), where g(5) = db(4) and

b(4) = g4 r4  dt  d3x +

(6.24)

this gives precisely the eld strength in the dimensional reduction ansatz (6.8).

thus we see that the solution (6.22) is precisely the k = 0 three-charge ads black

hole given in the previous subsection, after reparameterising the angular momenta 2
i =
 sinh2 i. this shows that the embedding of the three-charge ads k = 0 black hole

in gauged n = 2 supergravity in ve dimensions gives a ten-dimensional solution that

is precisely the decoupling limit of the rotating d3-brane. single-charge ads black holes

coming from the reduction of the metric of a rotating d3-brane with one angular momentum

were obtained in [152], however without the explicit embedding of the scalar elds. the

connection between the thermodynamics of ads black holes and rotating p-branes was

discussed in [152, 153].

it is also straightforward to oxidise the k = 1 and k = 1 ads black holes back to
d = 10 type iib. the metric is the same form as (6.20) with d~y  d~y replaced by the unit
metric for s3 or h 3 respectively. the 5-form eld strength follows by substituting the

ve-dimensional elds into (6.8).

6.5 s7 reduction of d=11 supergravity

the s7 reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity gives rise to so(8) gauged n = 8

supergravity in four dimensions. one may again consider a consistent truncation to n = 2,

for which the bosonic sector comprises the metric, four commuting u (1) gauge potentials,

three dilatons and three axions.
(that this is a consistent truncation can be seen by
reducing minimal non-chiral six-dimensional supergravity on t 2, for which the reduction

of (g , a(2), ) will give precisely the eld content we are considering. after gauging, this
would give the u (1)4 gauged theory. see appendix f for an extended discussion of this.)

we have not yet determined the complete reduction ansatz for the entire truncated theory

where the axions are included, but we can give the exact ansatz in the case where one

sets the axions to zero. this will not, of course, be a consistent truncation, since the u (1)
gauge elds will provide source terms of the form  f f for the axions. nevertheless,

one can use the axion-free ansatz for discussing the exact embedding of four-dimensional

solutions for which the axions are zero. the full n = 2 four-dimensional theory, including

the axions, is obtained in appendix f.

the reduction ansatz for the eleven-dimensional metric is

one might think that it would be possible to obtain the four-dimensional lagrangian

by substituting the ansatze (6.25) and (6.30) into the eleven-dimensional lagrangian. in

fact this is not the case, and one must work at the level of the eleven-dimensional equations

of motion. one way of understanding this is from the fact that the ansatz for f(4) does

not identically satisfy the bianchi identity. rather, as we have seen, it satises it modulo

the use of the four-dimensional equations of motion for the scalars and gauge elds.

in

other words, the ansatz is made on the eleven-dimensional 4-form f(4) rather than on the

fundamental potential a(3) itself. consequently, it would not be correct to insert the ansatz

for f(4) into the lagrangian.

we may further illustrate this point by showing, as an example, how the scalar potential

arises in the four-dimensional einstein equation. this comes from considering the eleven-

dimensional einstein equation,

with vielbein indices a, b ranging just over the four-dimensional spacetime directions , .

15if the ansatze (6.25) and (6.30) are linearised around an ads4  s7 background, they can be seen to

be in agreement with previous results that were derived at the linear level [159]. the full non-linear metric

ansatz (6.25) should be in agreement with the appropriate specialisation of the ansatz given in [185].

where r and r are the four-dimensional ricci tensor and scalar, and the ellipsis indi-

cate that terms not involving purely the undierentiated scalars have been omitted for the

purposes of the present illustrative discussion. from the ansatz (6.30) for the 4-form, the

eleven-dimensional energy-momentum tensor vielbein components in the four-dimensional

spacetime directions are given by

(6.36)

substituting (6.34), (6.35) and (6.36) into (6.33), we nd that all the angular dependence

coming from the i variables cancels, and that the scalar potential terms in the four-

dimensional einstein equation are given by

r  1

2 r  =  1

2 g2 v  ,

(6.37)

with v given by

v = 4xi<j

xi xj = 8(cosh 1 + cosh 2 + cosh 3) .

(6.38)

since (6.37) derives from the lagrangian r  g2 v , we see that we have precisely produced
the hoped-for potential terms of the gauged supergravity lagrangian (6.32). this sample

calculation also serves to illustrate that the angular dependence coming from the i variables

would not have cancelled if we had merely substituted the ansatze (6.25) and (6.30) into the

eleven-dimensional lagrangian. it also shows that the cancellation of the i dependence in

the higher-dimensional equations of motion depends crucially on conspiracies between the

contributions from the metric and the 4-form eld strength. this is quite dierent from the

situation in toroidal reductions, where each term in the higher-dimensional theory reduces

consistently by itself, without the need for any such conspiracies. note, furthermore, that

the required conspiracies needed for the success of the spherical reduction depend on the

4-form eld strength occurring with precisely the correct coecient relative to the einstein-

hilbert term. this normalisation is not a free parameter, but is governed by the strength

of the f f a term in the eleven-dimensional theory. thus ultimately the consistency of

63

the spherical reduction ansatz can be traced back to the supersymmetry of the eleven-

dimensional theory.

note that the lagrangian (6.32) can be further truncated, to pure einstein-maxwell

with a cosmological constant, by setting all the eld strengths equal, f i

(2) = 1

2 f(2), and

setting all the scalars to zero:

e1l4 = r  1

4 (f(2))2 + 24g2 .

(6.39)

the embedding of this theory into d = 11 supergravity was obtained in [162]. the ansatz

for the metric and eld strength for the embedding in [162] was given in terms of a decompo-
sition of the 7-sphere as a u (1) bundle over cp 3. this is identical, after a transformation of
coordinates, to the einstein-maxwell embedding given in [151]. in the same spirit, the s5 re-

duction to ve-dimensional einstein-maxwell can be described using the method presented
in [162], with s5 viewed as a u (1) bundle over cp 2. (an analogous consistent embedding

of four-dimensional einstein-yang-mills with an su (2) gauge group, and a cosmological

constant, in d = 11 supergravity was obtained in [186]. this involves a decomposition of
s7 as an su (2) bundle over s4.)

6.6 d=4 ads black holes

space of constant negative curvature. in the case of k = 0, one must rst make the rescaling

we nd that its eld strength f(4) = da(3) is also of the form given in (6.30) for the dimen-

non-extremal 4-charge ads black holes into eleven-dimensional supergravity, and further-

more, that they become precisely the decoupling limit of the rotating m 2-branes. it should,

of course, be emphasised that the four-dimensional ads black holes that we are considering
at this point have t 2 rather than s2 horizons, corresponding to k = 0 in (6.40) and (6.41).
it is also straightforward to oxidise the k = 1 and k = 1 ads black hole solutions back
to d = 11, by substituting the four-dimensional elds into the ansatze (6.25) and (6.30).

6.8 s4 reduction of d=11 supergravity

the kaluza-klein reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on s4 gives rise to n = 4
in a similar manner to the s5 and s7

gauged so(5) supergravity in seven dimensions.

reductions that we discussed previously, we may consider an n = 2 truncation of this

seven-dimensional theory. as described in the introduction, the truncated theory comprises

n = 2 supergravity coupled to a vector multiplet, comprising the metric, 2-form potential,

four vector potentials and four scalars in total. for our present purposes, we shall focus

on a further truncation where only the metric, two gauge potentials (which are associated
with the u (1)  u (1) cartan subgroup of so(5)) and two scalars are retained. this is not
in general a consistent truncation, but, as in the case of the neglect of the axions in the
s7 reduction, it is consistent for a subset of solutions where the truncated elds are not

excited by the ones that are retained. in particular, solutions of the n = 2 theory for which
(2)  f 2

we nd that we can obtain this truncated theory by making the following kaluza-klein

(2) = 0, such as the ads black holes, will also be solutions of this truncated theory.

saddle point at x1 = x2 = 21/5 [187]. note that by making use of the auxiliary variable

as in the previous cases we discussed, the k = 0 solution is obtained by rst rescaling

obtained in [152], by isolating the spacetime direction of the rotating m 5-brane metric.

this is precisely the k = 0 ads7 black hole obtained in the previous section, with the
angular momenta reparameterised as i =  g2 sinh2 i/16. this establishes that the 2-

charge k = 0 ads black hole in d = 7 can be reinterpreted as the decoupling limit of the

rotating m 2-brane. (of course in this example, one can only discuss the embedding when

the scalar elds are included, since there is no choice of charge parameters for which the

scalar elds vanish in the seven-dimensional black holes. this contrasts with the cases of

the rotating d3-branes and m 5-branes, where the special choice of setting all the charges

equal allows the discussion of a simplied ansatz where the scalars are omitted.)

69

6.11 charge as angular momentum

to those students of kaluza-klein theory who are used to the idea that electric charge is

momentum in an extra dimension, it may come as a bit of a shock to learn that the electric

charges of the ads black holes correspond to angular momenta in extra dimensions. my
understanding of this is as follows and it relies crucially on the interpretation of ads d+1 
sd+1 vacua as the near-horizon limit of ( d  1)-brane geometries.

momentum and angular momentum correspond to generators of the poincare group

or ads group, and hence to spacetimes that are asymptotically minkowski or ads.
the spacetime is asymptotically m d, for example,

it makes sense to talk about angu-

if

lar momentum in d dimensions. on the other hand, if the spacetime is asymptotically
ads d+1  sd+1, it makes sense to talk about angular momentum in ( d + 1) dimensions but
not in d = ( d + d + 2) dimensions. of course, there is an so(d + 2) symmetry but this is
just the isometry group of sd+1; i see no reason (yet) to call this angular momentum 16.

the ability to call so(d + 2) angular momentum depends crucially on the the fact
that the ads d+1 vacua are near horizon geometries of ( d  1)-branes and that these brane
geometries tend asymptotically to m d+d+2. we can now legitimately refer to sd+1 as the

rotation group in the d dimensions transverse to the branes, and if we allow these branes

to spin it will describe their angular momentum.

(having said this, one should probably not refer to the electric charge of ordinary ve-

dimensional kaluza-klein as momentum in the fth direction either. after all, the sym-
metry group of m 4  s1 is p4  u (1) and not p5.)

6.12 magnetic black holes

we have seen that the n = 8 gauged supergravity naturally admits a four-electric-charge

black hole solution.

in fact it turns out that this solution is easily generalized to give

magnetically charged black holes; although the full theory involves non-abelian so(8) gauge
elds, the u (1)4 truncation of (6.32) gives rise to bosonic equations of motion that are

symmetric under the electric-magnetic duality

f i  x2

(6.69)

the resulting four magnetic charge solution in the case k = 1 has the form

ds2 = (h1h2h3h4)1/2f dt2 + (h1h2h3h4)1/2(f1dr2 + r2d2),

16somewhat confusingly, some authors refer to the black holes as spinning in the sd+1 directions but

this is, in my opinion, an abuse of language.

while the extremal limit is once again reached by taking   0 and i   with p 
 sinh2 i xed, the resulting extremal black hole is in fact not supersymmetric whenever
g 6= 0! in the case of the magnetic reissner-nordstrom black hole, this phenomenon was
previously found in [91]. (note, however, that it is possible to obtain magnetic black holes

that do preserve some supersymmetry if one allows for event horizons with non-spherical

topologies [197]) to see that (6.70) admits no killing spinors, we note that while the scalar
potential is symmetric under xi  xi1, the scalar related terms in the supersymmetry
variations are not. in particular, focusing on , we nd for example

(2(3)i(1) ) =

ijr(r log

h1h3
h2h4

[jk  if1/205jk]

+r((h1 + h3)  (h2 + h4))[2grf1/2rjk])k(1) (6.71)
(where   1 = 2 = 3 = 4), indicating explicitly that the g-dependent term on the last
line has a dierent structure than the others. this is in contrast to the electric solution.
additionally, note that the matrices [i05ij] and [rij] now commute, while previously,
for the electric black hole, they had anticommuted in the absence of 5.

for both of the above reasons, we see that whenever g 6= 0 none of the supersymmetry
variations vanish, and hence the magnetic solution is non-bps (regardless of the choice of
signs of the magnetic charges). in the g  0 limit, on the other hand, the last line of (6.71)
drops out, and we are left with

(23i(1) ) = 2ijrr log

h1h3
h2h4

pj(1),

(6.72)

where p ij

 = 1

2 [ij  i05ij] is the projection appropriate to a magnetically charged

solution.

just as for the electrically charged solutions, we may embed the magnetically charged

solutions back in eleven dimensions. although the electrically charged black holes then have

the interpretation as the near-horizon limit of a rotating m 2-brane, we do not have any

such simple interpretation in the magnetic case.

71

6.13 kaluza-klein states as black holes

for ungauged n = 8 supergravity, the supersymmetry algebra admits 4 central charges
z1, z2, z3, z4. states fall into 5 categories according as they are annihilated by 4  q  0
supersymmetry generators. q also counts the number of zs that obey the bound m = zmax.

non-rotating black holes (in the sense of vanishing bosonic kerr angular momentum l) be-

long to superspin l = 0 supermultiplets [192, 166]. starting with a spin j = 0 member,

the rest of the black hole multiplet may then be lled out using the fermionic zero-modes
[193, 194]. the spin will run from j = 0 up to j = (8  q)/2. for gauged supergravity, the
algebra is dierent with no central charges but the same multiplet shortening phenomenon

still occurs [195, 204]. so we can be condent that the above black holes preserving 4, 2, 1, 0
supersymmetries will belong to supermultiplets with maximum spins 2, 3, 7/2, 4 17. unfor-

tunately, as far as we know, the analogue of the m = zmax condition has never been been

spelled out in the literature.

it is presumably some relation between the ads quantum

numbers (e0, s) and the so(8) casimirs.

it seems entirely consistent, therefore, to identify a subset of the maximum spin 2 black
hole supermultiplets with the s7 kaluza-klein spectrum, in analogy with the black hole

kaluza-klein correspondence of ungauged supergravity [196, 204]. the subset in question
will correspond to electric black holes whose mass is quantized in units of the inverse s7

radius. however, this raises the puzzle of how the black holes carrying only u (1) charges

can be identied with the kaluza-klein particles carrying non-trivial so(8) representations.

although we have not demonstrated this explicitly, it seems reasonable to suppose that

it is the fermion zero modes that provide the non-trivial so(8) quantum numbers just

as they provide the non-trivial spin. the fact that these nonabelian charges arise from

fermionic hair also nicely circumvents the usual no-hair theorems of classical relativity. in

this connection, it would be interesting to repeat the gyromagnetic ratio calculations of

[194] and verify that the fermionic hair again yields a gyromagnetic ratio equal to 1, as

demanded by kaluza-klein reasoning.

it is furthermore tempting, in analogy with the ungauged case, to identify the 2, 3 and 4

charge solutions as 2, 3 and 4-particle bound states of the singly charged solution [166, 198].

however, although the quantum number assignments are consistent with this, we do not

have multi-center solutions in the ads case. such a bound state interpretation would, of

course, lead to states of arbitrarily high spin.

17the maximum spin 5/2 solutions are (mysteriously?) absent just as for ungauged supergravity.

72

another dierence between the s7 and the t 7 compactications is that the g  0 limit
of the gauged supergravity does not directly coincide with the massless sector of the t 7

compactication. they dier by various dualizations. thus it was possible, for example, to

nd 4-charge solutions with all charges electric as opposed to the 2-electric and 2-magnetic

charges of the ungauged theory. moreover, whereas 2 charges are kaluza-klein modes and

2 are winding modes in the type iia string theory context, there is no t or u-duality
associated with the s7 compactication.

one might also generalize the purely electric and purely magnetic solutions discussed

here to dyonic black hole solutions of gauged n = 8 supergravity. neither magnetic nor

dyonic black holes have any kaluza-klein interpretation and do not appear in the spectrum
of the s7 compactication of d = 11 supergravity. it would be interesting to provide their

m -theory interpretation and to determine their role in the ads/cf t correspondence.

6.14 recent developments

since these lectures were delivered, several papers have appeared on related topics:

* explicit kaluza-klein ansatze for deriving various gauged supergravites have recently

been given: n = 4, d = 7 gauged supergravity from d = 11 supergravity [223, 224]; n = 1,
d = 7 gauged supergravity from d = 11 supergravity [225]; n = 4, su (2)  u (1), d = 5
gauged supergravity from d = 10 type iib supergravity [226]; n = 4, so(4), d = 4

gauged supergravity from d = 11 supergravity [227]. the complete ansatz for n = 8,

so(6), d = 5 gauged supergravity from d = 10 type iib supergravity remains unsolved.

* the cft duals of ads black holes rotating in spacetime and carrying electric charge

as a consequence of the rotation of the corresponding branes in the transverse dimensions,

as discussed in section 6, are treated in [228] and [245]. these papers also exploit the

appearance of the n = 8 superconformal singleton action [39] as the membrane on the

boundary, discussed in section 5.

* the thermodynamics of spinning branes and their eld theory duals are discussed in

[247], while the phase structure of non-commutative eld theories and spinning brane bound

states are discussed in [248].

* unitary supermultiplets of osp(6, 2|4), discussed in section 5, and the ads7/cf t6

correspondence are treated in [229].

* an application of the correspondence between ads4 and a d = 3 conformal eld theory

involving the squashed s7 [69, 20] discussed in section 2.2 is given in [244].

* the membrane at the end of the universe nds application in [240], which resolves

73

some puzzles in the ads/cf t correspondence.

* a review of m -theory cosmology may be found in [241].

6.15 problems 6

1. calculate the ricci tensor for the general kaluza-klein ansatz for odd sphere s2k1

reductions of the d-dimensional metric.

2. compute the near-horizon limit of the rotating p-brane carrying a single charge given

in the special case of one extra dimension, g11 = e3,  = e/3, we obtain the
required result.

note that, of the original d-dimensional dieomorphism group with parameters m (x, y),

the surviving symmetry is the 4-dimensional dieomorphism group with parameters
(x), an abelian u (1)k gauge invariance with parameter m(x) and a global sl(n, r)

invariance with constant parameter am

(7.14)

where  = 0, 1, 2, 3 and m = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and write the so(1, 10) spinor index as

 = (, )

(7.15)

where  = 1, . . . 4 is a spinor index of so(1, 3) and  = 1, . . . 8 is a spinor index of
so(7). then the elds split according to the t 7 column of table 8.

s7

the spin assigments are obvious except for the 3-form and 2-form gauge elds. a

3-form is dual to a non-propagating auxilary eld c:

gggg ga = c

(7.16)

and c = constant as a result of the bianchi identity dda  0. similarly, a 2-form
gauge eld is dual to a scalar eld :

gggga = 

(7.17)

and 2 = 0 as a result of the bianchi identity.

to summarize: the particle content of n = 8, d = 4 supergravity is (1 spin 2, 8 spin

3/2, 28 spin 1, 56 spin 1/2, 70 spin zero).

7.2 solutions 2

1. the einstein equation follows from varying with respect to gm n and the 3-form equa-

tion follows by varying with respect to am n p . we shall need the identities:

(ggm n rm n ) = (g)gm n rm n +g(gm n )rm nggm n (rm n ) (7.18)

76

and

ggm n gm n
g =

ggm n rm n = n (ggm n m l

l)  l(ggm n m n

(7.19)

(7.20)

(7.21)

l)

since the last expression is a total divergence we can drop the nal term in (7.18).

similarly

(ggm rgn s gp t gqu fm n p qfrst u ) = g(4fm

p qrfn p qr

1
2

gm n f p qrsfp qrs)

(7.22)

bearing in mind that the af f term is independent of the metric, we obtain the

einstein equation (2.1).

a straightforward variation of the action with respect to am n p then yields the 3-form

equation (2.34).

2. we begin by making an ansatz for the d = 11 gauge elds gm n = em

bab and
am n p corresponding to the most general six-ve split invariant under p6  so(5),
where p6 is the d = 6 poincare group. we split the d = 11 coordinates

aen

xm = (x, ym)

(7.23)

where  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and m = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and write the line element as

ds2 = e2a dxdx + e2bmndxmdxn

(7.24)

and the 4-form gauge eld strength as

fmnpq = mnpqrrec

(7.25)

all other components of fm n p q and all components of the gravitino m are set

equal to zero. p6 invariance requires that the arbitrary functions a, b and c depend
only on ym; so(5) invariance then requires that this dependence be only through
y = mnymyn.

as we shall show, the three arbitrary functions a, b, and c are reduced to one by

the requirement that the eld conguration (7.24) and (7.25) preserve some unbroken

supersymmetry. in other words, there must exist killing spinors  satisfying

dm  = 0

77

(7.26)

where dm is the bosonic part of the supercovariant derivative appearing in the su-
persymmetry transformation rule of the gravitino (a.18).

we make the six-ve split

where  and a are the d = 6 and d = 5 dirac matrices respectively and where

a = (  1, 7  a)

(7.27)

7 = 0 . . . 5

so that 7

2 = 1. we also decompose the spinor eld as

(x, y) = (x)  (y)

(7.28)

(7.29)

where  is a constant spinor of so(1, 5) which may further be decomposed into chiral
eigenstates via the projection operators (1  7)/2 and  is an so(5) spinor .
in our background (7.24) and (7.25), the supercovariant derivative becomes:

(7.30)

(7.31)

(7.32)

(7.33)

in each case, (7.31) means that one half of the maximal possible supersymmetry

survives.

with the substitutions (7.24), (7.25) and (7.33), the einstein equation and the 4-form

equation reduce to the single equation for one unknown:

mnmnec = 0

(7.34)

78

and hence, imposing the boundary condition that the metric be asymptotically minkowskian,

we nd

ec = 1 +

b3
y3

(7.35)

where k6 is a constant, at this stage arbitrary. thus the metric is given by

ds2 = (1 + b3/y3)1/3dxdx + (1 + b3/y3)2/3(dy2 + y2d4

and the four-form eld strength by

here 4 is the volume form on s4 and 4 is the volume.

7.3 solutions 3

1. we use the duality between m -theory compactied on a 2-torus t 2 of area a (mea-
sured with the m theory metric gm ) and the type iib theory compactied on a
circle s1 of radius r (measured with the iib metric gb = 2gm ) [101]. thus p-brane
tensions of dimension d = p + 1 will be related to each other by t m

b.

d = dtd

the d = 9 particle spectrum will involve kaluza-klein m 0-branes of mass t m
1 (w ) = 2rt b
2a1/2 which are identied with winding states of mass t b

(7.38)

there will also be winding m 0-branes of mass at m

2. the lagrangian of d = 9 n = 2 supergravity as low-energy limit of type iia string

compactied on a circle can be obtained from dimensional reduction of type iia

supergravity in d = 10, which itself can be obtained from dimensional reduction

of d = 11 supergravity. using the notation adopted in [168], the bosonic sector of

the theory contains the vielbeins, a dilaton  together with a second dilatonic scalar

 (which measures the size of the compactifying circle), one 4-form eld strength

the d = 10 iia string and iib string are related by by a perturbative t-duality,

in that type iia string compactied on a circle with radius r is equivalent to type

iib string compactied on a circle with radius 1/r. at the level of their low-energy

eective actions, it implies that there is only one d = 9 n = 2 supergravity. the

lagrangians (7.47) and (7.49) are related to each other [86] by local eld redenitions.

the relations between the gauge potentials of these two nine-dimensional theories

(including the axions) are summarized in table 9.

7.4 solutions 4

1. we begin with the bosonic sector of the d = 3 worldvolume of the d = 11 super-

membrane 4.1. to see how a double worldvolume/spacetime compactication of the

d = 11 supermembrane theory on s1 leads to the type iia string in d = 10, let

us denote all (d = 3, d = 11) quantities by a hat and all (d = 2, d = 10) quantities

without. we then make a ten-one split of the spacetime coordinates

m = (xm , y)

x

m = 0, 1, . . . , 9

and a two-one split of the worldvolume coordinates

i = (i, 2)


i = 0, 1

in order to make the partial gauge choice

2 = y,

(7.52)

(7.53)

(7.54)

which identies the eleventh dimension of spacetime with the third dimension of the

worldvolume. the dimensional reduction is then eected by taking the background
elds g m n and a m n p to be independent of y. the string backgrounds of dilaton ,
string -model metric gm n , 1-form am , 2-form bm n and 3-form am n p are given by

gm n = e2/3

am n p = am n p

gm n + eam an e2am

e2an

e 

am n y = am n .

(7.55)

82

the choice of dilaton prefactor, e2/3, is dictated by the requirement that gm n be the

d = 10 string -model metric. ( to obtain the d = 10 vebrane -model metric, the

prefactor is unity because the reduction is then spacetime only and not simultaneous

worldvolume/spacetime. this explains the remarkable coincidence between gm n

and the d = 10 vebrane -model metric.)

varying the supermembrane action (4.1) with respect to the metric ij yields the
embedding equation

while varying with respect to x m yields the equation of motion

(7.58)

having made the two-one split of the worldvolume coordinates and the ten-one split

of the spacetime coordinates, and having made the partial gauge choice, the double

dimensional reduction is then eected by demanding that

where f m n p is the eld strength of am n p ,

f m n p = 3[m an p ]

(7.65)

in the case m = y, (7.57) is an identity as it must be for consistency.

of (7.67).

7.5 solutions 5

1. rotating p-branes in arbitrary dimensions, supported by a single (p + 2)-form charge,

are all straightforwardly obtained by diagonally oxidising the rotating black holes
constructed in [172]. there are two cases arising, depending on whether d is even or

odd.

in this case d + 2 = 2n , there are n angular momenta i, with i = 1, 2, . . . , n . we
nd that the metric of the rotating (n  2)-brane solution to the equations is

i 2

i di(cid:17)  dn2x .

(7.70)

the n quantities i, as usual, are subject to the constraint pi 2
i = 1. one can
parameterise the i in terms of (n  1) unconstrained angles. a common choice is

i1yj=1

cos j ,

i  n  1 ,

i = sin i

n =

n1yj=1

cos j .

(7.71)

note that qn

j=1 cos j is dened to be equal to 1 if n  0.

in the case d + 2 = 2n + 1, the solution has the same form as above, but with the

range of the index i extended to include 0. however, there is no angular momentum

parameter or azimuthal coordinate associated with the extra index value, and so

0 = 0 and 0 = 0. otherwise, all the formulae given above are generalised simply
by extending the summation to span the range 0  i  n . of course h0 = 1 as a
consequence of 0 = 0.

7.6 solutions 6

i=1 xi =
1. this form of the line element encompasses both the s5 reduction of type iib
supergravity and the s7 reduction of eleven dimensional supergravity. as dened
previously, e =pk

in the absence of the gauge elds, this metric has a block diagonal form, with the
blocks corresponding to the d-dimensional spacetime, the k1 direction cosines i and
the k azimuthal rotation angles i. the main diculty in computing the curvature

i andpk

i=1 xi2

i=1 2

i = 1.

of (7.72) lies in the fact that the is are constrained. nevertheless, we may perform
an asymmetric choice of using the rst k  1 of them as actual coordinates, while
expressing k as the constrained quantity k = (1 pk1

i=1 2

i )1/2.

85

since numerous terms are involved in the computation,

it is imperative to clar-

ify our notation. we denote the lower-dimensional spacetime indices by , , . . . =
0, 1, . . . , d  1, the direction cosine indices by , , , . . . = 1, 2, . . . , k  1 and the az-
imuthal indices by i, j, . . . = 1, 2, . . . , k. note that for instance implicit sums over 
always run over k  1 values, while sums over i always run over the full k values.
thus (with vanishing gauge elds) the d-dimensional metric may be expressed in the

form

where gij = x1

this allows the use of expressions such as k =  and   = 1

one expects  = 0 in order to prevent any e dependence from appearing in front of

and the s7 reductions considered in the text.

we have only computed selected components of the full d-dimensional ricci tensor

which are of interest in the kaluza-klein reduction. while we have used an asymmetric

parameterisation of the direction cosines, the nal results are symmetric in all k of

the is. for the lower-dimensional components of rm n we nd

(7.78)

to make contact with the kaluza-klein reductions, we note that explicit computation

of er yields
er = e1[2e1x x 32  2e1x xx x 22 + (x x)2 x x 2] ,
where we have followed a shorthand notation of removing indices so that, p x 32

expression simplies to yield er(k=3) = 2e2x1x2x3 = 2e2. additionally, we often

i ie = 2[e1x xx x 22 x x 2] ,

(7.80)

the s5 reduction of type iib supergravity discussed in section 6.2 corresponds to
the choice of d = 5 and a = b = 1

+2(e1 + 3x x1) ,

e1/2r(d=10)
where we have used the simplied expression for er(k=3) given above. on the other

hand, the s7 reduction of eleven dimensional supergravity, given by the line element
(6.25), corresponds to the choice of d = 4 and a = 2

b the eld equations, symmetries and transformation rules

of type iib supergravity

next we consider type iib supergravity in d = 10 [21, 22] which also describes 128 + 128

degrees of freedom, and corresponds to the eld-theory limit of the type iib superstring.

the spectrum of the supergravity theory consists of a complex scalar a, a complex spinor
r and a real

, a complex 2-form am n , a complex weyl gravitino m , a real graviton em

4-form am n p q whose 5-form eld strength fm n p qr obeys a self-duality condition. the

complex weyl spinors m and  have opposite handedness

11m = m

11 = 

(b.1)

(b.2)

owing to the self-duality of fm n p qr, there exists no covariant action principle.

it is

(c.6)

(c.7)

when the equations of motion are satised and hence the matrices (1)/2 act as projection
operators. the transformation rule (c.4) therefore permits us to gauge away one half of

the fermion degrees of freedom. as desribed below, this gives rise to a matching of physical

boson and fermion degrees of freedom on the worldvolume.

the kappa symmetry is achieved only if certain constraints on the antisymmetric tensor

eld strength fm n p..q(z) and the supertorsion are satised. one can show that the con-
a and am n p are nothing but the equations of motion

straints on the background elds em

of eleven-dimensional supergravity.

d the eld equations, symmetries and transformation rules

of the m5-brane

the m 5-brane equations are elegantly derived from the superembedding formalism which

treats the brane as a supermanifold m embedded in a larger spacetime supermanifold m . in

this subsection, therefore, we use the notations and conventions of [230, 231]. in particular,
we denote by zm = (xm, ) the local coordinates on m , and a = (a, ) is the target tangent

space index. we use the ununderlined version of these indices to label the corresponding
quantities on the worldvolume. the embedded submanifold m , with local coordinates ym ,
is given as zm (y).

95

the suitable pullbacks of the super 3-form and the induced metric are

ij = (cid:16)izm em

a is the target space su-

where em

a is the supervielbein on m5. the embedding matrix ea

a plays an important

role in the description of the model, and it is dened as

(d.2)

here, we give the nonlinear eld equations of the supervebrane equations, up to second
a = 0, which are
order fermionic terms, that follow from the superembedding condition e
proposed to arise equally well from the f-constraint fbc = 0, where we have introduced
the super 2-form a2 and the following super 3-form in m5:

f3  da2  f5 a3 .

(d.3)

and where f5 is the pullback associated with the embedding map f5 : m5  m . the
details of the procedures can be found in [232, 231]. a key point is the emergence of a

super 3-form h in world superspace. this form arises in the following component of the

embedding matrix

e

which can also be veried by direct computation by combining (4.19) and (d.20).

the equations of motion (4.13) have been shown [234] to be equivalent to those which

follow from an action with auxiliary scalar eld [235].

we conclude this section by elucidating the consequences of the central equation (4.19).

one nds fabc = fabc + 2q1ma
dfbcd. using the identity m2 = 2m  q, we readily nd
the nonlinear self-duality equation

 fmnp = q1gm

qfnpq .

(d.23)

e the lagrangian, symmetries and transformation rules of

the d3-brane

here we present a lorentz invariant and supersymmetric worldvolume action for all type
ii dirichlet p-branes, p  9, in a general type ii supergravity background [236]. the super
dirichlet p-brane action, in a general n = 2 supergravity background (for the string-frame

metric) takes the form

where

sd = sddbi + sdw z

sddbi = tdz dd eq det(ij + fij)

(e.1)

(e.2)

is a dirac-born-infeld type action and iw z is a wess-zumino (wz) type action to be
discussed below; fij are the components of a modied 2-form eld strength

f = f  b ,

(e.3)

where f = dv is the usual eld strength 2-form of the bi eld v and b is the pullback

to the worldvolume of a 2-form potential b on superspace, whose leading component in

a -expansion is the 2-form potential of neveu-schwarz/neveu-schwarz (ns-ns) origin in

type ii superstring theory. we use the same letter for superspace forms and their pullbacks

to the worldvolume since it should be clear from the context which is meant. superspace
forms may be expanded in the coordinate basis of 1-forms dz m or on the inertial frame
basis ea = dz m em
a is the supervielbein. the basis ea decomposes under
the action of the lorentz group into a lorentz vector ea and a lorentz spinor. the latter is

a, where em

a 32-component majorana spinor for iia superspace and a pair of chiral majorana spinors

for iib superspace. thus

(ea, e i ), i = 1, 2

(e.4)

for type iib. we allow  to run from 1 to 32 but include a chiral projector as appropriate.

the worldvolume metric gij appearing in (e.2) is dened in the standard way as

ij = ea

i eb

j ab

100

(e.5)

where  is the d = 10 minkowski metric and

ea

i = iz m em

a .

(e.6)

thus idbi is a straightforward extension to superspace of the corresponding term in

the bosonic action. the same is true for the wz term. we introduce a r-r potential a as
a formal sum of r-form superspace potentials a(r), i.e.

a =

10xr=0

a(r) .

(e.7)

the even potentials are those of iib supergravity while the odd ones are those of iia
supergravity. in the bosonic case one could omit the 10-form gauge potential f (10) on the

grounds that its 11-form eld strength is identically zero. but an 11-form eld strength on

superspace is not identically zero; in fact we shall see that it is non-zero even in a minkowski

background, a fact that is crucial to the -symmetry of the super 9-brane action.

the wz term can now be written as

sdw z = tdzw

aef + mics

(e.8)

where, in the rst term, the product is understood to be the exterior product of forms

and the form of appropriate degree is chosen in the form-expansion of the integrand, i.e.

(p + 1) for a dirichlet p-brane. the ics term is a (p + 1)-form chern-simons (cs) action

that is present (for odd p) in a massive iia background; its coecient m is the iia mass

parameter. this wz term is formally the same as the known bosonic dirichlet p-brane wz
action, but here the forms c (r) and b are taken to be forms on superspace, e.g.

a(r) =

1
r!

dz m1  dz mr amr...m1 .

(e.9)

this illustrates the standard normalization and the reverse order convention for compo-

nents of superspace forms. this convention goes hand in hand with the convention for

exterior dierentiation of superspace forms in which the exterior derivative acts from the

right. thus,

da(r) =

1
r!

dz m1  dz mr dz n n amr...m1

the eld strength for the r-r eld a is

f (a) = da  ha + meb

(e.10)

(e.11)

where m is the mass parameter of the iia theory. f (a) can be written as the formal sum

f (a) =

f (n) .

11xn=1

101

(e.12)

note that the top form is an 11-form because we included a 10-form a(10) in the denition
of a. the eld strengths f (n) will be subject to superspace constraints, to be given below

for bosonic backgrounds, in addition to the constraint relating the bosonic components of
f (n) to the hodge dual of the bosonic components of f (10n).

each term in (e.1) is separately invariant under the global iia or iib super-poincare

group as well as under (p + 1)-dimensional general coordinate transformations. however,

local kappa symmetry is achieved by a subtle conspiracy between them, just as in the case

of super p-branes with scalar supermultiplets.

in these lectures, we are primarily interested in the d3-brane and so may set p = 3 in

the above formulae.

f d=4, n=2 gauged supergravity

the so(8) gauged n = 8 supergravity in four dimensions was obtained in [157, 158] by

gauging an so(8) subgroup of the global e7 symmetry group of [189, 190]. to avoid some of

the complications of non-abelian gauge elds, one may consider a truncation of this model

to n = 2, for which the bosonic sector comprises the metric, four commuting u (1) gauge

potentials, three dilatons and three axions. in the absence of axions, this truncation was

obtained in [150] by working in the symmetric gauge for the 56-bein and incorporating

three real scalars. as was noted, there is a straightforward generalization of the scalar

ansatz to allow for complex scalars. taking into account the e7 self-duality condition

ijkl



ijkl



4! ijklmnpqmnpq, the scalar ansatz of [150] may be generalized as:

= ijkl = 1

(1)

(34) + 

(2)

(24) + 

(3)

(23)]ijkl, (f.1)

where we follow the notation and conventions of [150] (including the denition of so(8)

index pairs). note that the three complex scalars may be parameterised in terms of their
magnitudes and phases as (i) = (i)ei(i)

.

here, we shall consider the full n = 2 truncation, where the three axions are included

as well as the other elds. in fact the structure of the potential is little changed. we nd

that the lagrangian including the axions may be written in the form

e1l4 = r 1

2xi (cid:16)((i))2 + sinh2 (i)((i))2(cid:17) 1

2 (f ()+

 mf ()+ +h.c.)g2v , (f.2)

where the potential is given simply by

v = 8(cosh (1) + cosh (2) + cosh (3)) .

(f.3)

102

the complex symmetric scalar matrix m is quite complicated, and incorporates all three
complex scalars () in a symmetric manner; this is presented below.

in terms of the n = 2 truncation, the three complex scalars each parameterise an

sl(2; r)/so(2) coset. this may be made explicit by performing the change of variables
((i), (i))  (i, i):

cosh (i) = cosh i + 1
cos (i) sinh (i) = sinh i  1
sin (i) sinh (i) = i ei .

while this n = 2 truncation of the n = 8 theory essentially treats all four u (1) gauge

elds equally, it was noted that one can make contact with the theory obtained by reduction
of a closed string on t 2 through dualisation of two of the gauge elds. to be specic, we
dualise f (2)
 , which singles out the dilaton-axion pair s = 2 + ie2. after an
additional eld redenition s  1/s, we obtain the bosonic lagrangian

 and f (4)

where the potential is still given by (f.8). the scalar matrix m is given in terms of the

by m = v tv, and the gauge elds have been arranged in the particular order

f = [ f (3)

finally, l = 2  2 satises l2 = i4, where 2 is the standard pauli matrix. it is worth
mentioning that the pure scalar lagrangian can be expressed as

(f.13)

i vi and vi is given by

vi = ei/2" 1 i
0 ei# .

we see that, save for the potential, the dualized lagrangian is indeed of the form
obtained from t 2 compactication from six dimensions. in this case, two of the sl(2; r)s

now correspond to t -dualities while the third corresponds to s-duality. note that the

initial choice of which two eld strengths to dualise has determined which of the three

dilaton-axion pairs (i, i) is to be identied with the strong-weak coupling sl(2; r).

having shown that the bosonic lagrangian is considerably simplied by dualising to the
eld variables that arise in the t 2 reduction, we may re-express the result (f.12) in the
more explicit notation of [168, 191]. thus the bosonic sector of the gauged u (1)4 theory

may be written as

e1l4 = r  1

here , a(0)12 and a1

(0)2 are the axions 2, 1 and 3, and the potential is given by (f.8).
the inclusion of the potential term in the gauged supergravity theory breaks all three

sl(2; r) symmetries to o(2), acting as   (a + b)/(c + d), where

  a b

d! =  cos /2

(f.19)

in terms of the original (, ) scalar variables in (f.2), this o(2) subgroup corresponds to
   + . the o(2) symmetry is, however, sucient for generating dyonic solutions.
nevertheless, we note that the fermionic sector and in particular the supersymmetry trans-

formations are not invariant under this symmetry of the bosonic sector. one manifestation

of this particular situation is the fact that magnetic black holes of this theory are not su-

persymmetric, even though they may be extremal. furthermore, in a related note, while

it is clear that the dualisation procedure performed above runs into diculty in the full

n = 8 theory with non-abelian so(8) gauging, the fermionic sector does not admit such a

straightforward dualisation, even in the n = 2 abelian truncation. this is easily seen by

the fact that the gravitini are necessarily charged under the gauge elds and hence couple

to the bare gauge potentials themselves.
