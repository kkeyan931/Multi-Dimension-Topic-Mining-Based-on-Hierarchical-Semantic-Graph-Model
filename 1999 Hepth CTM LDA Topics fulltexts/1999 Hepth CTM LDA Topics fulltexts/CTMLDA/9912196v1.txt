abstract

we apply the thermodynamic bethe ansatz to investigate the high energy
behaviour of a class of scattering matrices which have recently been proposed
to describe the homogeneous sine-gordon models related to simply laced lie
algebras. a characteristic feature is that some elements of the suggested s-
matrices are not parity invariant and contain resonance shifts which allow
for the formation of unstable bound states. from the lagrangian point of
view these models may be viewed as integrable perturbations of wznw-coset
models and in our analysis we recover indeed in the deep ultraviolet regime
the eective central charge related to these cosets, supporting therefore the
s-matrix proposal. for the su (3)k-model we present a detailed numerical
analysis of the scaling function which exhibits the well known staircase pat-
tern for theories involving resonance parameters, indicating the energy scales
of stable and unstable particles. we demonstrate that, as a consequence of
the interplay between the mass scale and the resonance parameter, the ul-
traviolet limit of the hsg-model may be viewed alternatively as a massless
ultraviolet-infrared-ow between dierent conformal cosets. for k = 2 we
recover as a subsystem the ow between the tricritical ising and the ising
model.

1 introduction

the thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) is established as an important method
which serves to investigate o-shell properties of 1+1 dimensional quantum eld
theories. originally formulated in the context of the non-relativistic bose gas by
yang and yang [1], it was extended thereafter by zamolodchikov [2] to relativistic
quantum eld theories whose scattering matrices factorize into two-particle ones.
the latter property is always guaranteed when the quantum eld theory in question
is integrable. provided the s-matrix has been determined in some way, for instance
via the bootstrap program [3] or by extrapolating semi-classical results, the tba
allows to calculate the ground state energy of the integrable model on an innite
cylinder whose circumference is identied as compactied space direction. when
the circumference is sent to zero the eective central charge of the conformal eld
theory (cft) governing the short distance behaviour can be extracted. in the case
in which the massive integrable eld theory is obtained from a conformal model
by adding a perturbative term which breaks the conformal symmetry, the tba
constitutes therefore an important consistency check for the s-matrix.

the main purpose of this manuscript is to apply this technique to a class of scat-
tering matrices which have recently been proposed [4] to describe the homogeneous
sine-gordon models (hsg) [5, 6] related to simply laced lie algebras. the latter
have been constructed as integrable perturbations of wznw-coset theories [7] of
the form gk/h, where g is a compact simple lie group, h  g a maximal abelian
torus and k > 1 an integer called the level. these models constitute particular
deformations of coset-models [7], where the specic choice of the groups ensures
that these theories possess a mass gap [8]. the dening action of the hsg-models
reads

shsg[g] = scft[g] +

m2

2 z d2x (cid:10)+, g(~x)1g(~x)(cid:11) .

(1)

here scft denotes the coset action, h , i the killing form of g and g(~x) a group
valued bosonic scalar eld.  are arbitrary semi-simple elements of the cartan
subalgebra associated with h, which have to be chosen not orthogonal to any
root of g and play the role of continuous vector coupling constants. the latter
constraints do not restrict the parameter choice in the quantum case with regard to
the proposed s-matrix which makes sense for every choice of . they determine
the mass ratios of the particle spectrum as well as the behaviour of the model under
a parity transformation. the parameters m and 2 = 1/k + o(1/k2) are the bare
mass scale and the coupling constant, respectively. the non-perturbative denition
of the theory is achieved by identifying h+, g(~x)1g(~x)i with a matrix element
of the wznw-eld g(~x) taken in the adjoint representation, which is a spinless
primary eld of the coset-cft and in addition exchanging 2 by 1/k and m by the
renormalised mass [8]. some of the conformal data of scft[g], which are in principle
extractable from the tba analysis are the virasoro central charge c of the coset

(2)

here  denotes the rank of g and h its coxeter number. since we have  <
1 for all allowed values of k, the perturbation is always relevant in the sense of
renormalisation.

the simplest example of a hsg theory is the complex sine-gordon model [6, 9]
associated with the coset su(2)k/u(1). as we will argue below, more complicated
hsg theories can be viewed as interacting copies of complex sine-gordon theo-
ries. the classical equations of motion of these models correspond to non-abelian
ane toda equations [5, 10], which are known to be classically integrable and ad-
mit soliton solutions. identifying these solutions by a noether charge allows for a
semi-classical approach to the quantum theory by applying the bohr-sommerfeld
quantization rule. the integrability on the quantum level was established in [8] by
the construction of non-trivial conserved charges, which suggests the factorization
of the scattering matrix. based on the assumption that the semi-classical spectrum
is exact, the s-matrix elements have then been determined in [4] by means of the
bootstrap program for hsg-models related to simply laced lie algebras.

the proposed scattering matrix consists partially of  copies of minimal su(k)-
ane toda eld theories (atft) [11], whose mass scales are free parameters. the
scattering between solitons belonging to dierent copies is described by an s-matrix
which violates parity [4]. these matrices possess resonance poles and the related
resonance parameters which characterize the formation of unstable bound states
are up to free choice. in the tba-analysis these resonances lead to the staircase
patterns in the scaling function, which have been observed previously for similar
models [12]. however, in comparison with the models studied so far, the hsg
models are distinguished in two aspects. first they break parity invariance and
second some of the resonance poles can be associated directly to unstable particles
via a classical lagrangian.

one of the main outcomes of our tba-analysis is that the suggested [4] scatter-
ing matrix leads indeed to the coset central charge (2), which gives strong support
to the proposal.

in addition, we present a detailed numerical analysis for the su(3)-hsg model,
but expect that many of our ndings for that case are generalizable to other lie
groups. the presence of two parameters, i.e. the mass scale and the resonance
parameter allow, similar as for staircase models studied previously, to describe
the ultraviolet limit of the hsg-model alternatively as the ow between dierent
conformal eld theories in the ultraviolet and infrared regime. we nd the following

we slightly abuse here the notation and use cgk instead of cgk/u(1). since we always en-

counter these type of coset in our discussion, we can avoid bulky expressions in this way.

massless ow

uv  su(3)k/u(1)2  su(2)k/u(1)  su(2)k/u(1)  ir .

(3)

we also observe the ow (su(3)k/u(1)2)/(su(2)k/u(1))  su(2)k/u(1) as a
subsystem inside the hsg-model. for k = 2 this subsystem describes the ow
between the tricritical ising and the ising model previously studied in [13].
in
terms of the hsg-model we obtain the following physical picture: the resonance
parameter characterizes the mass scale of the unstable particles. approaching the
extreme ultraviolet regime from the infrared we pass various regions: at rst all
solitons are too heavy to contribute to the o-critical central charge, then the two
copies of the minimal atft will set in, leading to the central charge corresponding
to ir in (3) and nally the unstable bound states will start to contribute such that
we indeed obtain (2) as the ultraviolet central charge of the hsg-model.

the two values of the resonance parameter 0 and  are special, corresponding
in the classical theory to a choice of the vector couplings in (1) parallel to each other
or orthogonal to a simple root, respectively. in the former case parity is restored on
the classical as well as on the tba-level and the central charge corresponding to
uv in (3) is also recovered, whereas in the latter case the two copies of the minimal
atft are decoupled and unstable bound states may not be produced leading to
the central charge ir in (3).

our manuscript is organized as follows: in section 2 we briey recall the main
features of the two-particle hsg s-matrix elements stating them also newly in
form of an integral representation. in particular, we comment on the link between
unstable particles and resonance poles as well as on the loss of parity invariance. in
section 3 we introduce the tba equations for a parity violating system and carry
out the ultraviolet limit recovering the expected coset central charge. in section 4
we present a detailed study for the su(3)khsg model. we discuss the staircase
pattern of the scaling function and illustrate how the uv limit for the hsg-model
may be viewed as the uv-ir ow between dierent conformal models. we extract
the ultraviolet central charges of the hsg-models. we study separately the case
when parity is restored, derive universal tba-equations and y-systems. in section
5 we present explicit examples for the specic values k = 2, 3, 4,. our conclusions
are stated in section 6.

2 the homogeneous sine-gordon s-matrix

we shall now briey recall the main features of the proposed hsg scattering matrix
in a form most suitable for our discussion. labelling the solitons by two quantum
numbers, we take the two-particle scattering matrix between soliton (a, i) and soli-
ton (b, j), with 1  a, b  k  1 and 1  i, j  , as a function of the rapidity

dierence  to be of the general form sij
ab(). the particular structure of the con-
jectured hsg s-matrix makes it suggestive to refer to the lower indices as main
quantum numbers and to the upper ones as colour. in [4] it was proposed to de-
scribe the scattering of solitons which possess the same colour by the s-matrix of
the zk-ising model or equivalently the minimal su(k)-atft [11]

here we have introduced the abbreviation (x) = sinh 1

the general building blocks and denote the incidence matrix of the su(k)-dynkin
diagram by i. we re-wrote the above s-matrix from the block form (4) into a form
of an integral representation (5), since the latter is more convenient with respect to
the tba analysis. this calculation may be performed by specializing an analysis
in [14, 15] to the particular case at hand. the scattering of solitons with dierent
colour quantum numbers was proposed to be described by

with k g denoting the cartan matrix of the simply laced lie algebra g. here the
ij = 
ji are arbitrary k-th roots of 1 taken to the power a times b and the shifts
in the rapidity variables are functions of the vector couplings ij, which are anti-
symmetric in the colour values ij = ji. due to the fact that these shifts are
real, the function sij
ab() for i 6= j will have poles beyond the imaginary axis such
that the parameters ji characterize resonance poles. an important feature is that
(6) is not parity invariant, where parity is broken by the phase factors  as well as
the shifts . as a consequence, the usual relations

and

satised by the parity invariant objects (4), are replaced by

for the scattering between solitons with dierent colour values. important to note
is that the rst equality in (8) has no analogue in (9). thus, instead of being real
analytic, as sii
ab() for

ab(), the parity violation forces hermitian analyticity of sij

i 6= j. anti-particles are constructed in analogy to the atft, that is from the
automorphism which leaves the su(k)-dynkin diagram invariant, such that (a, i) =
(k  a, i). the colour of a particle and its anti-particle is identical. the crossing
relation of the s-matrix then reads

sij
ab() = sij

(ka)b() = sji

ba(i  ) .

(10)

for a general and more detailed discussion of these analyticity issues see [16] and
references therein.

analyzing the above s-matrix we have the following picture concerning the
formation of bound states: two solitons with the same colour value may form a
bound state of the same colour, whilst solitons of dierent colour with kij 6= 0, 2,
say (a, i) and (b, j), may only form an unstable state, say (c, k) whose lifetime and
energy scale are characterized by the parameter  by means of the breit-wigner
formula, see e.g. [17], in the form

ab() is situated at r =   i and k

where the resonance pole in sij
c denotes
the decay width of the unstable particle with mass m k
c . in the case a = b these
unstable states can be identied with solitons in the semi-classical limit [4, 24].
when  becomes zero, (12) shows that the unstable particles become stable, but
are still not at the same footing as the other asymptotically stable particles. they
become virtual states characterized by poles on the imaginary axis beyond the
physical sheet.

how many free parameters do we have in our model? computing mass shifts
from renormalisation, we only accumulate contributions from intermediate states
having the same colour as the two scattering solitons. thus, making use of the well
known fact that the masses of the minimal su(k)-ane toda theory all renormalise
with an overall factor [18], i.e. for the solitons (a, i) we have that m i
a equals a
constant for xed colour value i and all possible values of the main quantum number
a, we acquire in principle  dierent mass scales m1, . . . , m in the hsg-model. in
addition there are 1 independent parameters in the model in form of the possible
phase shifts ij = ji for each i, j such that k g
ij 6= 0, 2. this means overall we
have 2  1 independent parameters in the quantum theory. there is a precise
correspondence to the free parameters which one obtains from the classical point of
view. in the latter case we have the 2 independent components of  at our free
disposal. this number is reduced by 1 as a result of the symmetry +  c+ and
  c1 which introduces an additional dependence as may be seen from the

here the i are simple roots.

in comparison with other factorizable scattering matrices involving resonance
shifts, studied in the literature so far, the proposed hsg scattering matrices dier
in two aspects. first of all, they are not parity invariant and second they allow to
associate a concrete lagrangian description. the latter fact can be used to support
the picture outlined for the full quantum eld theory by a semi-classical analysis.
in [24] the semi-classical mass for the soliton (a, i) was found to be

where  is a coupling constant and the mi are the  dierent mass scales.

3 tba with parity violation and resonances

in this section we are going to determine the conformal eld theory which governs
the uv regime of the quantum eld theory associated with the s-matrix elements
(4) and (6). according to the dening relation (1) and the discussion of the previous
section, we expect to recover the wznw-coset theory with eective central charge
(2) in the extreme ultraviolet limit.
it is a well established fact that such high
energy limits can be performed by means of the tba. since up to now such an
analysis has only been carried out for parity invariant s-matrices, a few comments
are due to implement parity violation. the starting point in the derivation of the
key equations are the bethe ansatz equations, which are the outcome of dragging
one soliton, say of type a = (a, i), along the world line. for the time being we do
not need the distinction between the two quantum numbers. on this trip the formal
wave-function of a picks up the corresponding s-matrix element as a phase factor
when meeting another soliton. due to the parity violation it matters, whether the
soliton is moved clockwise or counter-clockwise along the world line, such that we
end up with two dierent sets of bethe ansatz equations

eilma sinh a yb6=a

sab(a  b) = 1

and

eilma sinh a yb6=a

sba(b  a) = 1 ,

(15)
with l denoting the length of the compactied space direction. these two sets of
equations are of course not entirely independent and may be obtained from each
other by complex conjugation with the help of relation (9). we may carry out the

6

thermodynamic limit of (15) in the usual fashion [2] and obtain the following sets
of non-linear integral equations

b() = r ma cosh  .

(16)

(17)

as usual we let the symbol  denote the rapidity convolution of two functions
dened by f  g() := r d/2 f (  )g(). here r = m1t 1 is the inverse
temperature times the overall mass scale m1 of the lightest particle and we also re-
dened the masses by m i
a/m1 keeping, however, the same notation. as very
common in these considerations we also introduced the so-called pseudo-energies
+
a() = 
a ()). the kernels in
the integrals carry the information of the dynamical interaction of the system and
are given by

a() and the related functions l

(18)

the statistical interaction is chosen to be of fermionic type. notice that (17) may
be obtained from (16) simply by the parity transformation    and the rst
equality in (18). the main dierence of these equations in comparison with the
parity invariant case is that we have lost the usual symmetry of the pseudo-energies
as a function of the rapidities, such that we have now in general +
a().
this symmetry may be recovered by restoring parity.

once the equations (16) have been solved for the 
a(). of special interest is the
deep uv limit, i.e. r  0, of this function since then its value coincides with the
eective central charge ce = c 12(0 + 0) of the conformal model governing the
high energy behaviour. here c is the virasoro central charge and 0, 0 are the
lowest conformal dimensions related to the two chiral sectors of the model. since the
wznw-coset is unitary, we expect that 0, 0 = 0 and ce = c. this assumption
will turn out to be consistent with the analytical and numerical results.

3.1 ultraviolet central charge for the hsg model

in this section we follow the usual argumentation of the tba-analysis which leads
to the eective central charge, paying, however, attention to the parity violation.

7

we will recover indeed the value in (2) as the central charge of the hsg-models.
first of all we take the limits r,   0 of (16) and (17). when we assume that
the kernels ab() are strongly peaked at  = 0 and develop the characteristic
plateaus one observes for the scaling models, we can take out the l-functions from
the integral in the equations (16), (17) and obtain similar to the usual situation

(20)

having the resonance parameter  present in our theory we may also encounter
a situation in which ab() is peaked at  = . this means in order for (20)
to be valid, we have to assume 
a() in the limit r  0 in addition
to accommodate that situation. for the last assumption we will not provide a
rigorous analytical argument, but will justify it instead for particular cases from
the numerical results (see e.g. gure 1). note that in (20) we have recovered the
parity invariance.

a(0) = 

for small values of r we may approximate, in analogy to the parity invariant sit-
uation, rma cosh  by r/2ma exp , such that taking the derivative of the relations

to solve the constant tba-equation (20) and may compute the eective central
charge in terms of rogers dilogarithm thereafter. notice that in the ultraviolet
limit we have recovered the parity invariance and (24) holds for all nite values of
the resonance parameter.

it should be noted that we understand the n-matrix here as dened in (20)
and not as the dierence between the phases of the s-matrix. in the latter case we
encounter contributions from the non-trivial constant phase factors . also in that
case we may arrive at the same answer by compensating them with a choice of a
non-standard statistical interaction as outlined in [22].

we would like to close this section with a comment which links our analysis to
structures which may be observed directly inside the conformal eld theory. when
one carries out a saddle point analysis, see e.g. [21], on a virasoro character of the
general form

(q) =



x~m=0

2 ~m(1n ) ~mt+ ~m ~b

q
(q)1 . . . (q)(k1)

,

(26)

with (q)m =qm
k=1(1 qk), one recovers the set of coupled equations as (20) and the
corresponding eective central charge is expressible as a sum of rogers dilogarithms
as (24). note that when we choose g  a1 the hsg-model reduces to the minimal
atft and (26) reduces to the character formulae in [23]. thus the equations (20)
and (24) constitute an interface between massive and massless theories, since they
may be obtained on one hand in the ultraviolet limit from a massive model and on
the other hand from a limit inside the conformal eld theory. this means we can
guess a new form of the coset character, by substituting (25) into (26). however,

9

since the specic form of the vector ~b does not enter in this analysis (it distinguishes
the dierent highest weight representations) more work needs to be done in order
to make this more than a mere conjecture. we leave this for future investigations.

4 the su(3)k-hsg model

we shall now focus our discussion on g = su(3)k. first of all we need to establish
how many free parameters we have at our disposal in this case. according to the
discussion in section 2 we can tune the resonance parameter and the mass ratio

 := 21 = 12

and m1/m2 .

(27)

it will also be useful to exploit a symmetry present in the tba-equations re-
lated to su(3)k by noting that the parity transformed equations (17) turn into the
equations (16) when we exchange the masses of the dierent types of solitons. this
means the system remains invariant under the simultaneous transformations

  

and

m1/m2  m2/m1 .

(28)

for the special case m1/m2 = 1 we deduce therefore that (1)
a (), meaning
that a parity transformation then amounts to an interchange of the colours. fur-
thermore, we see from (17) and the dening relation  = 21 = 12 that changing
the sign of the rapidity variable is equivalent to   . therefore, we can restrict
ourselves to the choice   0 without loss of generality.

a () = (2)

4.1 staircase behaviour of the scaling function

we will now come to the evaluation of the scaling function (19) for nite and
small scale parameter r. to do this we have to solve rst the tba equations (16)
for the pseudo-energies, which up to now has not been achieved analytically for
systems with a non-trivial dynamical interaction due to the non-linear nature of
the integral equations. nonetheless, numerically this problem can be controlled
relatively well. in the uv regime for r  1 one is in a better position and can
set up approximate tba equations involving formally massless particles for which
various approximation schemes have been developed which depend on the general
form of the l-functions. since the latter is not known a priori, one may justify
ones assumptions in retrospect by referring to the numerics. in section 5 we present

the concept of massless scattering has been introduced originally in [13] as follows: the on-
shell energy of a right and left moving particle is given by e = m/2e which is formally obtained
from the on-shell energy of a massive particle e = m cosh  by the replacement     /2 and
taking the limit m  0,    while keeping the expression m = me+/2 nite. it is these
on-shell energies we will encounter in our analysis.

numerical solutions for the equations (16) for various levels k showing that the l-
functions develop at most two (three if m1 and m2 are very dierent)plateaus in the
range ln r
r and then fall o rapidly (see gure 1). this type of behaviour
is similar to the one known from minimal atft [2, 29], and we can therefore adopt
various arguments presented in that context. the main diculty we have to deal
with here is to nd the appropriate massless tba equations accommodating the
dependence of the tba equations on the resonance shifts .

we start by separating the kernel (18) into two parts

ab() = ii

ab() = ij

ab() =z dt hab  2 cosh t
ab( + ji) =z dt (cid:0)2 cosh t

k (cid:0)2 cosh t
k  i(cid:1)1

ab eit

k  i(cid:1)1

abi eit ,
, i 6= j .

(29)

(30)

here ab() is just the tba kernel of the su(k)-minimal atft and in the remaining
kernels ab() we have removed the resonance shift. note that ,  do not depend on
the colour values i, j and may therefore be dropped all together in the notation. the
integral representations for these kernels are obtained easily from the expressions
(5) and (7). they are generically valid for all values of the level k. the convolution
term in (16) in terms of ,  is then re-written as

b() =

(31)

these equations illustrate that whenever we are in a regime in which the second term
in (31) is negligible we are left with  non-interacting copies of the su(k)-minimal
atft.

we will now specialize the discussion on the su(3)k-case for which we can elim-
inate the dependence on  in the second convolution term by performing the shifts
    /2 in the tba equations. in the uv limit r  0 with   1 the shifted
functions can be approximated by the solutions of the following sets of integral
equations

for    min[ln(2/r), ln(r/2) + )] (35)
where we have assumed m1 = m2. similar equations may be written down for
the generic case. to derive (35) we have neglected here the convolution terms
(ab  l(1)
b )(  ) which appear in the tba-equations for
(2)
a () and (1)
a (), respectively. this is justied by the following argument: for
||  ln 2/r the free on-shell energy term is dominant in the tba equations, i.e.
i
a()  r m a
a() are almost zero. the kernels ab are
centered in a region around the origin  = 0 outside of which they exponentially
decrease, see footnote in section 3.1.
for this. this means that the convolution
terms in question can be neglected safely if   ln(r/2) +  and   ln(2/r)  ,
respectively. note that the massless system provides a solution for the whole range
of  for non-vanishing l-function only if the ranges of validity in (34) and (35)
overlap, i.e.
ln(r/2)  min[ln(2/r), ln(r/2) + ] which is always true in the
limit r  0 when   0. the solution is uniquely dened in the overlapping region.
these observations are conrmed by our numerical analysis below.
the resulting equations (33) are therefore decoupled and we can determine l+
and l individually. in contrast, the equations (32) for l
a are still coupled to each
other due to the presence of the resonance shift. formally, the on-shell energies for
massive particles have been replaced by on-shell energies for massless particles in
the sense of [13], such that if we interpret r as an independent new scale parameter
the sets of equations (32) and (33) could be identied as massless tba systems in
their own right.

thus, we have formally decomposed the massive su(3)k-hsg model in the uv
regime into two massless tba systems (32) and (33), reducing therefore the problem
of calculating the scaling function of the hsg model in the uv limit r  0 to the
problem of evaluating the scaling functions (36) and (37) for the scale parameter
r. the latter depends on the relative size of ln(2/r) and the resonance shift /2.
keeping now   0 xed, and letting r vary from nite values to the deep uv
regime, i.e. r = 0, the scale parameter r governing the massless tba systems
will pass dierent regions. for the regime ln(2/r) < /2 we see that the scaling
functions (36) and (37) are evaluated at r > 1, whereas for ln(2/r) > /2 they
are taken at r < 1. thus, when performing the uv limit of the hsg model the
massless tba systems pass formally from the infrared to the ultraviolet regime
with respect to the parameter r. we emphasize that the scaling parameter r has
only a formal meaning and that the physical relevant limit we consider is still the
uv limit r  0 of the hsg model. however, proceeding this way has the advantage
that we can treat the scaling function of the hsg model by the uv and ir central
charges of the systems (32) and (33) as functions of r

(39)

here we dened the quantities cir := limr co(r), cu v := limr0 co(r) and
cir, cu v analogously in terms of co(r).

in the case of cir + cir 6= cu v + cu v , we infer from (39) that the scaling func-
tion develops at least two plateaus at dierent heights. a similar phenomenon was
previously observed for theories discussed in [12], where innitely many plateaus
occurred which prompted to call them staircase models. as a dierence, however,
the tba equations related to these models do not break parity. in the next sub-
section we determine the central charges in (39) by means of standard tba central
charge calculation, setting up the so-called constant tba equations.

4.2 central charges from constant tba equations
in this subsection we will perform the limits r  0 and r   for the massless
systems (32) and (33) referring to them formally as uv- and ir-limit, respec-
tively, keeping however in mind that both limits are still linked to the uv limit of
the hsg model in the scale parameter r as discussed in the preceding subsection.
we commence with the discussion of the uv limit r  0 for the subsystem
(32). we then have three dierent rapidity regions in which the pseudo-energies are
approximately given by

(40)

we have only kept here the dominant terms up to exponentially small corrections.
we proceed analogously to the discussion as may be found in [2, 29]. we see that in
the rst region the particles become asymptotically free. for the other two regions
the tba equations can be solved by assuming the l-functions to be constant.
exploiting once more that the tba kernels are centered at the origin and decay
exponentially, we can similar as in section 3.1 take the l-functions outside of the
integrals and end up with the sets of equations

2z  = 1  2(k su(k))1

and

n  :=

2z  = (k su(k))1 . (43)

since the set of equations (42) has already been stated in the context of minimal
atft and its solutions may be found in [29], we only need to investigate the
equations (41). these equations are simplied by the following observation. sending
 to  the constant l-functions must obey the same constant tba equation (41)
but with the role of l+
a interchanged. the dierence in the masses m1, m2
has no eect as long as m1  m2 since the on-shell energies are negligible in the
central region ln r     ln r. thus, we deduce x+
a =: xa and (41) reduces
to

a and l

a = x

with n = 1  (k su(k))1 .

(44)

remarkably, also these set of equations may be found in the literature in the context
of the restricted solid-on-solid models [20]. specializing some of the general weyl-
character formulae in [20] to the su(3)k-case a straightforward calculation leads
to

xa =

having determined the solutions of the constant tba equations (41) and (44) one
can proceed via the standard tba calculations along the lines of [2, 13, 29] and

and

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

for the reasons mentioned above cu v coincides with the eective central charge
obtained from su(k) minimal atft describing parafermions [7] in the conformal
limit. notice that cu v corresponds to the coset (su(3)k/u(1)2)/(su(2)k/u(1)).

the discussion of the infrared limit may be carried out completely analogous to
the one performed for the uv limit. the only dierence is that in case of the system
(32) the constant tba equations (41) drop out because in the central region the
free energy terms becomes dominant when r  . thus in the infrared regime
the central charges of both systems coincide with cu v ,

in summary, collecting the results (49) and (50), we can express equation (39)
explicitly in terms of the level k,

(51)

we have replaced the limits in (39) by mass scales in order to exhibit the underlying
physical picture. here m k
c is the smallest mass of an unstable bound state which
may be formed in the process (a, i) + (b, j)  (c, k) for k g
ij 6= 0, 2. we also used
that the breit-wigner formula (11) implies that m k

c  e/2 for large positive .

first one should note that in the deep uv limit we obtain the same eective
central charge as in section 3.1, albeit in a quite dierent manner. on the mathe-
matical side this implies some non-trivial identities for rogers dilogarithm and on

15

the physical (51) exhibits a more detailed behaviour than the analysis in section 3.1.
in the rst regime the lower limit indicates the onset of the lightest stable soliton
in the two copies of complex sine-gordon model. the unstable particles are on an
energy scale much larger than the temperature of the system. thus, the dynamical
interaction between solitons of dierent colours is frozen and we end up with
two copies of the su(2)k/u(1) coset which do not interact with each other. as
soon as the parameter r reaches the energy scale of the unstable solitons with mass
m k
c , the solitons of dierent colours start to interact, being now enabled to form
bound states. this interaction breaks parity and forces the system to approach
the su(3)k/u(1)2 coset model with central charge given by the formula in (2) for
g = su(3).

the case when  tends to innity is special and one needs to pay attention to

the order in which the limits are taken, we have

(52)

one might enforce an additional step in the scaling function by exploiting the
fact that the mass ratio m1/m2 is not xed. so it may be chosen to be very large or
very small. this amounts to decouple the tba systems for solitons with dierent
colour by shifting one system to the infrared with respect to the scale parameter
r. the plateau then has an approximate width of  ln|m1/m2| (see gure 2).
however, as soon as r becomes small enough the picture we discussed for m1  m2
is recovered.

4.3 restoring parity and eliminating the resonances
in this subsection we are going to investigate the special limit   0 which is
equivalent to choosing the vector couplings  in (1) parallel or anti-parallel. for
the classical theory it was pointed out in [5] that only then the equations of motion
are parity invariant. also the tba-equations become parity invariant in the absence
of the resonance shifts, albeit the s-matrix still violates it through the phase factors
. since in the uv regime a small dierence in the masses m1 and m2 does not
eect the outcome of the analysis, we can restrict ourselves to the special situation
m1 = m2, in which case we obtain two identical copies of the system

k1

(ab + ab)  lb() = r ma cosh  .

(53)

then we have a() = (1)

and the scaling function

xa=1

maz d la() cosh  .

16

(54)

the factor two in comparison with (19) takes the two copies for i = 1, 2 into account.
the discussion of the high-energy limit follows the standard arguments similar to
the one of the preceding subsection and as may be found in [2, 29].
instead of
shifting by the resonance parameter , one now shifts the tba equations by ln r/2.
the constant tba equation which determines the uv central charge then just
coincides with (41). we therefore obtain

lim

c(r, ) =

xa=1

l(cid:18) xa

.

(55)

thus, again we recover the coset central charge (2) for g = su(3), but this time
without breaking parity in the tba equations. this is in agreement with the results
of section 3.1, which showed that we can obtain this limit for any nite value of .

4.4 universal tba equations and y-systems

before we turn to the discussion of specic examples for denite values of the level
k, we would like to comment that there exists an alternative formulation of the
tba equations (16) in terms of a single integral kernel. this variant of the tba
equations is of particular advantage when one wants to discuss properties of the
model and keep the level k generic. by means of the convolution theorem and the
fourier transforms of the tba kernels  and , which can be read o directly from
(29) and (30), one derives the set of integral equations

i
a() + k  lj

a(  ji) =

k1

xb=1

iab k  (i

b + li

b)() .

(56)

we recall that i denotes the incidence matrix of su(k) and the kernel k is found
to be

k() =

k/2

cosh(k/2)

.

(57)

(58)

the on-shell energies have dropped out because of the crucial relation [31]

iabm i

b = 2 cos 

k m i
a ,

k1

xb=1

which is a property of the mass spectrum inherited from ane toda eld theory.
even though the explicit dependence on the scale parameter has been lost, it is
recovered from the asymptotic condition

i
a() 

rm i

a e .

(59)

17

the integral kernel present in (56) has now a very simple form and the k dependence
is easily read o.

closely related to the tba equations in the form (56) are the following func-
tional relations also referred to as y-systems. using complex continuation (see e.g.
[14] for a similar computation) and dening the quantity y i
a()) the
integral equations are replaced by

a () = exp(i

y i
a ( + i

k )y i

a (  i

k ) =(cid:2)1 + y j

a (  ji)(cid:3)

k1

yb=1(cid:2)1 + y i

b ()1(cid:3)iab .

(60)

the y-functions are assumed to be well dened on the whole complex rapidity
plane where they give rise to entire functions. these systems are useful in many
aspects, for instance they may be exploited in order to establish periodicities in the
y-functions, which in turn can be used to provide approximate analytical solutions
of the tba-equations. the scaling function can be expanded in integer multiples
of the period which is directly linked to the dimension of the perturbing operator.
noting that the asymptotic behaviour of the y-functions is lim y i
a () 
erm i
a cosh , we recover for    the y-systems of the su(k)-minimal atft derived
originally in [28]. in this case the y-systems were shown to have a period related
to the dimension of the perturbing operator (see (84)). we found some explicit
periods for generic values of the resonance parameter  as we discuss in the next
section for some concrete examples.

5 explicit examples

in this section we support our analytical discussion with some numerical results and
in particular justify various assumptions for which we have no rigorous analytical
argument so far. we numerically iterate the tba-equations (16) and have to choose
specic values for the level k for this purpose. as we pointed out in the introduction,
quantum integrability has only been established for the choice k > h. since the
perturbation is relevant also for smaller values of k and in addition the s-matrix
makes perfect sense for these values of k, it will be interesting to see whether the
tba-analysis in the case of su(3)k will exhibit any qualitative dierences for k  3
and k > 3. from our examples for the values k = 2, 3, 4 the answer to this question
is that there is no apparent dierence. for all cases we nd the staircase pattern of
the scaling function predicted in the preceding section as the values of  and x sweep
through the dierent regimes. besides presenting numerical plots we also discuss
some peculiarities of the systems at hand. we provide the massless tba equations
(32) with their uv and ir central charges and state the y-systems together with
their periodicities. finally, we also comment on the classical or weak coupling limit
k  .

5.1 the su(3)2-hsg model

this is the simplest model for the su(3)k case, since it contains only the two self-
conjugate solitons (1,1) and (1,2). the formation of stable particles via fusing is
not possible and the only non-trivial s-matrix elements are those between particles
of dierent colour

(61)

here we have chosen 12 = 21 = i. one easily convinces oneself that (61) satises
indeed (9) and (10). this scattering matrix may be related to various matrices which
occurred before in the literature. first of all when performing the limit   
the scattering involving dierent colours becomes free and the systems consists of
two free fermions leading to the central charge c = 1. taking instead the limit
  0 the expressions in (61) coincide precisely with a matrix which describes the
scattering of massless goldstone fermions (goldstinos) discussed in [13]. apart
from the factor i, the matrix s21
11 ()|=0 was also proposed to describe the scattering
of a massive particle [33]. having only one colour available one is not able to set up
the usual crossing and unitarity equations and in [33] the authors therefore resorted
to the concept of anti-crossing. as our analysis shows this may be consistently
overcome by breaking the parity invariance. the tba-analysis is summarized as
follows

it is interesting to note that the ow from the tricritical ising to the ising model
which was investigated in [13], emerges as a subsystem in the hsg-model in the
form cu v  cir. this suggests that we could alternatively also view the hsg-
system as consisting out of a massive and a massless fermion, where the former is
described by (36),(32) and the latter by (37),(33), respectively.

our numerical investigations of the model match the analytical discussion and
justies various assumptions in retrospect. figure 1 exhibits various plots of the
l-functions in the dierent regimes. we observe that for ln(2/r) < /2,  6= 0
the solutions are symmetric in the rapidity variable, since the contribution of the
 kernels responsible for parity violation is negligible. the solution displayed is
just the free fermion l-function, li() = ln(1 + erm i cosh ). approaching more and
more the ultraviolet regime, we observe that the solutions li cease to be symmetric
signaling the violation of parity invariance. the second plateau is then formed,
which will extend beyond  = 0 for the deep ultraviolet (see gure 1). the staircase
pattern of the scaling function is displayed in gure 2 for the dierent cases discussed
in the previous section. we observe always the value 6/5 in the deep ultraviolet

19

regime, but depending on the value of the resonance parameter and the mass ratio
it may be reached sooner or later. the plateau at 1 corresponds to the situation
when the unstable particles can not be formed yet and we only have two copies of
su(3)2 which do not interact. choosing the mass ratios in the two copies to be very
dierent, we can also switch them on individually as the plateau at 1/2 indicates.

the variable log r/2 at dierent values of the resonance shift and mass ratio.

5.2 the su(3)3-hsg model

this model consists of two pairs of solitons (1, 1) = (2, 1) and (1, 2) = (2, 2). when
the soliton (1, i) scatters with itself it may form (2, i) for i = 1, 2 as a bound state.

sij(  ij) =(cid:18) ij (1) 2

ij (2) ij (1) (cid:19) .

(64)

since soliton and anti-soliton of the same colour obey the same tba equations we
can exploit charge conjugation symmetry to identify i() := i
2() leading
to the reduced set of equations

1() = i

i() +   li()    lj(  ji) = rm i cosh , () = 

43 cosh 
1 + 2 cosh 2

.

(65)

the corresponding scaling function therefore acquires a factor two,

c(r, ) =

6 r

2 xi

m iz d cosh  li() .

(66)

this system exhibits remarkable symmetry properties. we consider rst the situa-
tion  = 0 with m1 = m2 and note that the system becomes free in this case

m (1) = m (2) =: m  (1)() = (2)() = rm cosh  .

(67)

meaning that the theory falls apart into four free fermions whose central charges
add up to the expected coset central charge of 2. also for unequal masses m1 6= m2
the system develops towards the free fermion theory for high energies when the
dierence becomes negligible. this is also seen numerically.

for  6= 0 the two copies of the minimal a2-atft or equivalently the scaling
potts model start to interact. the outcome of the tba-analysis in that case is
summarized as

unstable particle formation :

csu(3)3 = 2 = cu v + cu v =

.

as discussed in the previous case for k = 2 the l-functions develop an additional
plateau after passing the point ln(2/r) = /2. this plateau lies at ln 2 which is the
free fermion value signaling that the system contains a free fermion contribution
in the uv limit as soon as the interaction between the solitons of dierent colours
becomes relevant. figure 2 exhibits the same behaviour as the previous case, we
clearly observe the plateau at 8/5 corresponding to the two non-interacting copies
of the minimal a2-atft. as soon as the energy scale of the unstable particles is
reached the scaling function approaches the correct value of 2.

the y-systems (60) for k = 3 read

once again we may derive a periodicity

1,2 ( + 2i + ji) = y j

(69)

by making the suitable shifts in (68) and subsequent iteration.

5.3 the su(3)4-hsg model

this model involves 6 solitons, two of which are self-conjugate (2, 1) = (2, 1),
(2, 2) = (2, 2) and two conjugate pairs (1, 1) = (3, 1), (1, 2) = (3, 2). the cor-
responding two-particle s-matrix elements are obtained from the general formulae

for the scattering of solitons of dierent colours with 12 = ei 
4 . in this case the
numerics becomes more involved but for the special case m1 = m2 one can reduce
the set of six coupled integral equations to only two by exploiting the symmetry
l(1)
3(). the
numerical outcomes, shown in gure 2 again match, with the analytic expectations
(51) and yield for ln(2/r) > /2 the coset central charge of 18/7. in summary we
obtain

no unstable particle formation :

2csu(2)4 = 2 = cir + cir = 1 + 1 ,

which matches precisely the numerical outcome in gure 2, with the same physical
interpretation as already provided in the previous two subsections.

5.4 the semi-classical limit k  
as last example we carry out the limit k  , which is of special physical interest
since it may be identied with the weak coupling or equivalently the classical limit,
as is seen from the relation 2 = 1/k + o(1/k2). to illustrate this equivalence
we have temporarily re-introduced plancks constant.
it is clear from the tba-
equations that this limit may not be taken in a straightforward manner. however,

23

we can take it in two steps, rst for the on-shell energies and the kernels and nally
for the sum over all particle contributions. the on-shell energies are easily computed
by noting that the mass spectrum becomes equally spaced for k  

m i

a = m i

ka =

,

a <

.

(72)

for the tba-kernels the limit may also be taken easily from their integral repre-
sentations

ab() k

ab (cid:17)1(cid:19) and ab() k

(73)
when employing the usual integral representation of the delta-function. inserting
these quantities into the tba-equations yields

xb=1(cid:18)ab  2(cid:16)k su(k)

lj
b(  ) .
(74)
we now have to solve these equations for the pseudo-energies. in principle we could
proceed in the same way as in the case for nite k by doing the appropriate shifts
in the rapidity. however, we will be content here to discuss the cases   0 and
  , which as follows from our previous discussion correspond to the situation
of restored parity invariance and two non-interacting copies of the minimal atft,
respectively. the related constant tba-equations (42) and (44) become

ab (cid:17)1
xb=1(cid:16)k su(k)

   : xa k

(a + 1)2
a(a + 2)  1 and   0 : xa k

(a + 1)(a + 2)

a(a + 3)  1 .

(75)

the other information we may exploit about the solutions of (74) is that for large
rapidities they tend asymptotically to the free solution, meaning that

  0, :

li
a() 

ln(1 + er a mi cosh ) .

(76)

we are left with the task to seek functions which interpolate between the properties
(75) and (76). inspired by the analysis in [32] we take these functions to be

   :

  0 :

a() = ln"
sinh(cid:0) a

the expression (77) coincides with the expressions discussed in the context of the
breather spectrum of the sine-gordon model [32] and (78) is constructed in analogy.
we are now equipped to compute the scaling function in the limit k  

c(r, ) = lim

(79)

using (72), (77) and (78) the sum over the main quantum number may be computed
directly by expanding the logarithm. we obtain for k  
c(r)|= = 6r
c(r)|=0 = 6 r

xi=1z d mi cosh  ln(cid:0)1  er mi cosh (cid:1)
xi=1z d mi cosh [ln(cid:0)1  er mi cosh (cid:1) + ln(1  er 2mi cosh )]. (81)

here we have acquired an additional factor of 2, resulting from the identication of
particles and anti-particles which is needed when one linearizes the masses in (72).
taking now the limit r  0 we obtain

no unstable particle formation :
unstable particle formation :

2 csu(2) = 4
csu(3) = 6 .

(82)
(83)

the results (80), (82) and (81), (83) allow a nice physical interpretation. we
notice that for the case    we obtain four times the scaling function of a
free boson. this means in the classical limit we obtain twice the contribution of
the non-interacting copies of su(2)/u(1), whose particle content reduces to two
free bosons each of them contributing 1 to the eective central charge which is in
agreement with (2). for the case   0 we obtain the same contribution, but in
addition the one from the unstable particles, which are two free bosons of mass 2mi.
this is also in agreement with (2).

finally it is interesting to observe that when taking the resonance poles to be
r =   i/k the semi-classical limit taken in the breit-wigner formula (11) leads
to m2
k = (mi + mj)2. on the other hand (81) seems to suggest that mk = 2mi,
which implies that the mass scales should be the same. however, since our analysis
is mainly based on exploiting the asymptotics we have to be cautious about this
conclusion.

6 conclusions

our main conclusion is that the tba-analysis indeed conrms the consistency of
the scattering matrix proposed in [4]. in the deep ultraviolet limit we recover the

25

gk/u(1)-coset central charge for any value of the 2  1 free parameters entering
the s-matrix, including the choice when the resonance parameters vanish and parity
invariance is restored on the level of the tba-equations. this is in contrast to the
properties of the s-matrix, which is still not parity invariant due to the occurrence
of the phase factors , which are required to close the bootstrap equations [4].
however, they do not contribute to our tba-analysis, which means that so far
we can not make any denite statement concerning the necessity of the parity
breaking, since the same value for the central charge is recovered irrespective of the
value of the s. the underlying physical behaviour is, however, quite dierent as
our numerical analysis demonstrates. for vanishing resonance parameter the deep
ultraviolet coset central charge is reached straight away, whereas for non-trivial
resonance parameter one passes the dierent regions in the energy scale. also the
choice of dierent mass scales leads to a theory with a dierent physical content,
but still possessing the same central charge. to settle this issue, it would therefore
be highly desirable to carry out the series expansion of the scaling function in r and
determine the dimension  of the perturbing operator. it will be useful for this to
know the periodicities of the y-functions. we conjecture that they will be

y i

a(cid:0) + i(1  )1 + ji(cid:1) = y j

a (),

(84)

which is conrmed by our su(n)-examples. for vanishing resonance parameter and
the choice g = su(2), this behaviour coincides with the one obtained in [28]. this
means the form in (84) is of a very universal nature beyond the models discussed
here.

we also observe from our su(n)-example that the dierent regions, i.e. k > h
and k  h, for which quantum integrability was shown and for which not, respec-
tively, do not show up in our analysis.
it would be very interesting to extend the case-by-case analysis of section 5 to
other algebras. the rst challenge in these cases is to incorporate the dierent
resonance parameters.
