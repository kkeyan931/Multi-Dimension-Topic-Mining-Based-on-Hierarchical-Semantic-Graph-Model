abstract

using the methods of the form factor program exact expressions of all matrix
elements are obtained for several operators of the quantum sine gordon model:
all powers of the fundamental bose eld, general exponentials of it, the energy
momentum tensor and all higher currents.
it is found that the quantum sine-
gordon eld equation holds with an exact relation between the bare mass and
the renormalized mass. also a relation for the trace of the energy momentum is
obtained. the eigenvalue problem for all higher conserved charges is solved. all
results are compared with feynman graph expansions and full agreement is found.

the classical sine-gordon model is given by the wave equation

(t, x) +




sin (t, x) = 0.

since coleman [1] found the wonderful duality between the quantum sine-gordon and the
massive thirring model a lot of eort has been made to understand this quantum eld
theoretic model. a further contribution in this direction is the present paper of which
an extended version will be published elsewhere [2]. the bootstrap program (see e.g.
[3]) for integrable quantum eld theoretical models in 1+1 dimensions starts with the two
particle sine-gordon s-matrix for the scattering of fundamental bosons (lowest breathers)

from the s-matrix o-shell quantities as arbitrary matrix elements of local operators
are obtained by means of the form factor program [5]. in particular we provide exact
expressions for all matrix elements of all powers of the fundamental bose eld (t, x)
and its exponential n exp i(t, x) for arbitrary . here and in the following n denotes
normal ordering with respect to the physical vacuum which means in particular for the
vacuum expectation value h 0| n exp i(t, x)| 0i = 1. for the exceptional value  = 
we nd that the operator 1n sin (t, x) is local. moreover the quantum sine-gordon
eld equation1

mass by2

where m is the physical mass of the fundamental boson. the factor
sin  modies the
classical equation and has to be considered as a quantum correction. for the sinh-gordon
model an analogous quantum eld equation has been obtained in [23]3. note that in
particular at the free fermion point   1 (2  4) this factor diverges, a phenomenon
which is to be expected by short distance investigations [8]. for xed bare mass square
 and   2, 3, 4, . . . the physical mass goes to zero. these values of the coupling are
known to be specic: 1. the bethe ansatz vacuum in the language of the massive thirring
model shows phase transitions [9] and 2. the model at these points is related [10, 11, 12]
to baxters rsos-models which correspond to minimal conformal models with central
charge c = 1  6/(( + 1)) (see also [23]).

[6, 7].

2one of the authors (h.b.) has learned from al.b. zamolodchikov that this mass relation is consistent

with his results in [18].

3it should be obtained from (1) by the replacement   ig. however the relation between the bare
and the renormalised mass in [23] diers from the analytic continuation of (2) by a factor which is
1 + o( 4) 6= 1.

this formula is consistent with renormalization group arguments [13, 14]. in particular
this means that 2/4 is the anomalous dimension of cos . again this operator equation
is modied by a quantum correction (1  2/8). obviously for xed bare mass square
 and 2  8 the model will be conformal invariant which is related to a berezinski-
kosterlitz-thouless phase transition [4, 16, 17]4. the proofs of the statements (1)  (4) is
sketched in the following together with some checks in perturbation theory. the complete
proofs will be published elsewhere [2].

let o(x) be a local scalar operator. the generalized form factors are dened by the

vacuum  n-particle matrix elements

h 0| o(x)| p1, . . . , pn iin = eix(p1+...+pn) f o

n (1, . . . , n) ,

where the i are the rapidities of the particles p

which means in particular analytic continuation i  i  i.

for an odd number of solitons and anti-solitons [19] and for chargeless operators [2] a
general integral representation of generalized form factors has been proposed. using this
integral representations and the fusion soliton + anti-soliton  breather the following
general formula for the k-function has been derived in [2]5. it turns out to be of the form

5bosonic sine-gordon form factors have also been derived in [20]. for the sinh-gordon model form
factors where obtained in [21, 22, 23] in terms of determinants of symmetric polynomials. they are
related to those of this paper by the analytic continuation   ig.

where zi = i  i
2 (1 + (2li  1)). the dependence on the operator is encoded in the
p-function po
n . it is separately symmetric with respect to the variables  and z and has
to fulll some simple conditions in order that the form factor function f o
n fulll some
properties [5, 20]. these properties follow (see [19]) from general lsz-assumptions and in
additions specic features typical for integrable eld theories. in particular the recursion
relation holds

here we will not provide more details but only give some examples of operators and their
corresponding p-functions:

1. the correspondence of exponentials of the eld and their p-function6 is

n ei

for an arbitrary constant .

2. taking derivatives of this formula with respect to  we get for the eld and its

powers

3. higher currents (for m = 1,3, . . .) correspond to the p-functions

for n = even and zero for n = odd. for m = 1 we get the light cone components
of the energy momentum tensor t  = j 

 with ,  =  (see also [23]).

in order to prove equations as for example (1) and (4) we consider the corresponding
p-functions and their k-functions dened by (5). the k-functions are rational functions of
the xi = ei. we analyze the poles and the asymptotic behavior and nd identities by in-
duction and liouvilles theorem. transforming these identities to the corresponding form
factors one nds the eld equation (1) and the trace equation (4) up to normalizations.
normalization constants are obtained in the various cases by the following observa-

tions:

a) the normalization a eld annihilating a one-particle state is given by the vacuum

one-particle matrix element, in particular for the fundamental bose eld one has

h 0| (0)| pi = z  with z  = (1 + )

in [5]. this gives the normalization constant

1 = z /2
n (1)

(10)

for the form factors of the fundamental bose eld and which are obtained from the
p-function of (8) for n = 1.

b) if a local operator is connected to an observable like a charge q = r dxo(x) we use

the relation

h p | q| pi = qh p | pi.

for example for the higher charges we obtain

c) we use weinbergs power counting theorem for bosonic feynman graphs [2]7. for the
exponentials of the boson eld o = n ei this yields in particular the asymptotic
behavior

f o
n (1,2, . . .) = f o

1 (1) f o

n1(2, . . .) + o(e re 1)

as re 1   in any order of perturbation theory. this behavior is also assumed
to hold for the exact form factors. applying this formula iteratively we obtain from
(5) with (7) the following relation for the normalization constants of the operators
n ei

n = (n 

1 )n

n 

(n  1).

d) the recursion relation (6) relates nn+2 and nn. for all p-functions mentioned above

we obtain

nn+2 = nn

sin f (i)

(n  1).

using c) and d) we calculate the normalization constants for the exponential of the

eld n ei and obtain

1 = z  
n 

2

.

(11)

the normalization constants (10) and (11) now yield the eld equation (1) with the
mass relation (2). the statement (4) is proved similarly. the eigen value equation (3) is
obtained by taking the scalar products with arbitrary out-states and by using a general
crossing formula [2].

7this type of arguments has been also used in [5, 21, 22, 23].

all the results may be checked in perturbation theory by feynman graph expansions.
in particular in lowest order the relation between the bare and the renomalized mass (2)
is given by figure 1 (a). it had already been calculated in [5] and yields

m2 =

which agrees with the exact formula above. similarly we check the quantum corrections
of the trace of the energy momentum tensor (4) by calculating the feynman graph of
figure 1 (b) with the result again taken from [5] as

h p| n cos   1| pi = 2 1 +

8! + o(6).

this again agrees with the exact formula above since the normalization given by eq. (3)

implies h p| t
