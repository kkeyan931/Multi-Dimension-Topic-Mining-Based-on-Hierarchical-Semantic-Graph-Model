non-perturbative eects of constant magnetic elds in a higgs-yukawa gauge model are studied
using the extremum equations of the eective action for composite operators.
it is found that
the magnetic eld induces a higgs condensate, a fermion-antifermion condensate, and a fermion
dynamical mass, hence breaking the discrete chiral symmetry of the theory. the results imply that
for a non-simple group extension of the present model, the external magnetic eld would either
induce or reinforce gauge symmetry breaking. possible cosmological applications of these results in
the electroweak phase transition are suggested.

symmetry behavior in quantum eld theories under the inuence of external elds has long been a topic of intensive
study in theoretical physics [1]. in the present paper we are interested in particular in non-perturbative eects produced
by external magnetic elds in gauge theories with scalars. our main claim is that for theories with non-simple gauge
group, scalar-scalar and scalar-fermion interactions, the magnetic eld reinforces gauge symmetry breaking.

the observation of large-scale galactic magnetic elds in a number of galaxies, in galactic halos, and in clusters of
galaxies [2] has recently stimulated a large number of works trying to explain the physical mechanism responsible for
the origin of these elds. many of the proposed generating mechanisms have compelling arguments in favor of the
existence of strong primordial magnetic elds (for a review of cosmological generating mechanisms see [3] and references
therein). since primordial magnetic elds could play a signicant role in particle cosmology, the investigations on the
theme have recently boomed. in this context, the implications of a magnetic-eld-driven gauge symmetry breaking
mechanism may be important.

several years before this renewed interest in cosmological magnetic elds, ambjrn and olesen [4] considered the
electroweak model in the presence of a constant magnetic eld. assuming certain special values of the couplings,
they obtained a w- and z-condensate solution forming a lattice of abelian vortex lines for a range of magnetic elds
lying between m2
. at even larger values of the magnetic elds they found that the phase transition
to a symmetric phase can be reached at temperatures lower than the critical one at zero eld. this result realizes,
although due to a totally dierent reason, an old suggestion [5] that large magnetic elds could induce the transition
from the broken to the unbroken phase in the electroweak system.

more recently, the ground state of the electroweak theory in the presence of a hypermagnetic eld has been investi-
gated using either numerical or perturbative calculations [6]- [10]. the main motivation of these papers was to study
the possibility that a hypermagnetic eld could allow the realization of baryogenesis within the standard model [6].
even though the original results [6] for the upper bound of the higgs mass needed to have baryogenesis in the sm
were quite optimist, it was quickly realized that higher loop eects [7], [10] and numerical non-perturbative calcu-
lations [8] would signicantly weaken the transition. moreover, posterior studies on which certain subtleties of the
theory- like the magnetic dipole moment of the sphaleron [9] or ring diagrams contributions to the high-temperature
eective potential [10]- were taken into account, concluded that albeit the hypermagnetic eld strengthen the rst
order character of the phase transition, it is not enough to satisfy the sm baryogenesis condition [11]

when a non-perturbative analytic approach is used to study eld theories in external magnetic elds, new non-

magnetic eld, known in the literature as magnetic catalysis [12]. this phenomenon, which has proven to be rather
universal and model independent, has recently attracted a lot of attention [13]- [18].

on normal circumstances massless fermions can condensate and acquire a dynamical mass, but the condensate
appears only for suciently strong coupling between fermions. the new feature when a magnetic eld is present is
that it favors (catalyzes) the symmetry breaking by reducing to the weakest attractive coupling the strength of the
interaction needed to break the symmetry. the essence of this eect is that the fermions in the lowest landau level
(lll) constitute the eective fermionic degrees of freedom whose dynamics dominates the long wavelength behavior
of the system. the phenomenon is driven by the fact that massless fermions acquire an energy gap in the presence of
a magnetic eld, but there is no energy gap between the vacuum and the lll fermions. then, in the infrared region,
the dynamics of the lll fermions dominates the fermion propagator, making it essentially d-2 dimensional. this
eective dimensional reduction strengthen the fermion pairing dynamics [12], [19] giving rise to a fermion condensate.
it is worth to mention that the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis is not only interesting from a purely fundamental
point of view, but it has potential application in condensed matter [20]- [23] and cosmology [16]. for instance, it
has been recently speculated that the generation of mass through magnetic catalysis in lower dimensional models
[21], [22], or in four-dimensional models with boundaries [23], could be behind the physical mechanism explaining the
observed scaling of the thermal conductivity in superconducting cuprates with an externally applied magnetic eld
[24]. on the other hand, the magnetic catalysis could inuence the character of the electroweak phase transition as
suggested by the results of ref. [16].

in the present paper we consider a simple model eld theory with the aim of investigating in a self-consistent
way how scalar-scalar and fermion-scalar interactions in the presence of an external magnetic eld can inuence the
stability of the vacuum. it is not intended as a realistic theory, but rather as an example of a large class of theories
with scalar elds, on which dynamical symmetry breaking (either chiral or gauge) can be catalyzed by an external
magnetic eld. in this sense, it could be useful for condensed matter, as well as for cosmological applications. if
this toy model is extended to include a non-simple gauge group theory, as for instance the electroweak model, the
results of this paper could provide a scenario on which, in contrast to the eect found by ambjrn and olesen [4],
an external magnetic eld could either induce gauge symmetry breaking or reinforce it, in the case it already exists,
through non-perturbative eects.

let us consider the following theory of gauge, fermionic and real scalar elds described by the higgs-yukawa

note that a fermion mass term m is forbidden, since it is invariant under (3) and (4), but not under the discrete

to study the vacuum solutions that could arise in the theory (2) under the inuence of an external constant magnetic

eld b, we need to solve the extremum equations of the eective action  for composite operators [25], [26]

where g(x, x) = (x) =(cid:10)0 | (x)(x) | 0(cid:11) is a composite fermion-antifermion eld, and c represents the vev of the

higgs eld. thanks to the discrete chiral symmetry (5), it is enough to consider only one composite eld. we choose

2

the composite eld g(x, x), ignoring the second possible one, (x) =(cid:10)0 | (x)i5(x) | 0(cid:11) , since the eective action

can be a function only of the chirally invariant combination 2 = 2 + 2.

the loop expansion of the eective action  for composite operators [25], [26] can be expressed as

in eq. (8) c is a constant and s (c) is the classical action evaluated in the scalar vev (higgs condensate) c. the bar
on the fermion propagator g (x, y) means that it is taken full, while the non-bar notation indicates free propagators,

the extremum equations (6) and (7) correspond, respectively, to the schwinger-dyson (sd) equation for the fermion
self-energy operator  (gap equation), and to the usual minimum equation for the expectation value of the scalar
eld, which in the presence of the magnetic eld has to be determined in a self-consistent way, that is, simultaneously
with the gap equation.

although we have introduced a bare scalar mass  in (2), because we are interested in the possibility of a dynamically

generated scalar mass, we take the limit   0 at the end of our calculations.
the second to fth terms in the eective action (8) correspond to one-loop contribution. their evaluation is quite
straightforward (the scalar self-interaction can be renormalized in the usual way [27]), with the exception of the
fermion contributions, which contain the background magnetic eld. then, let us calculate explicitly the one-loop
fermion contribution coming from the term

in the above equations we have introduced the ritus ep functions [28]. these orthonormal function-matrices

provide an alternative method to the schwingers approach to problems of qft on electromagnetic backgrounds1.

it is worth to notice the following. it is a well known fact that in the present model, in the absence of a magnetic
eld, the eective action (potential) has a non-zero minimum at the one-loop level, but this minimum lies far outside
the expected range of validity of the one-loop approximation, even for arbitrarily small coupling constant, so it must

, being
be rejected as an artifact of the used approximation [30]. when a magnetic eld is present, the term
proportional to the fermion condensate, dominates the radiative corrections in the minimum equation (7). due to
this, the dynamically generated fermion condensate gives rise to a non zero scalar minimum that is in agreement
with the used approximation. in other words, thanks to the magnetic eld, a consistent minimum solution can be
generated by radiative corrections.
in this sense, a sort of non-perturbative coleman-weinberg mechanism takes
place, with the dierence that in the present case no dimensional transmutation is needed. since the theory already
contains a dimensional parameter, the magnetic eld b, there is no need to include scalar-gauge interactions in order
to trade a dimensionless coupling for the dimensional parameter c [30]. no constraint between the couplings has to
be assumed, except that they are all suciently weak.

the two-loop contributions are a little more involved. as we have not enough space in a letter to give all the
detailed calculations, we will explicitly show, for the sake of understanding, the evaluation of one term. the others
can be found in a similar way. the complete calculation will be published elsewhere.

first, notice that the second and fourth term in eq. (9) generate tadpole diagrams in the sd equation (6). it is
easy to realize that the tadpole diagram with the gauge-fermion vertex vanishes. however, the tadpole associated to
the scalar-fermion vertex is not zero when c 6= 0 and, as shown below, it has a signicant contribution to the gap

note that the tadpole term is proportional to the magnetic eld and inversely proportional to the scalar mass. this
functional dependence will be responsible for the notorious increment of the mass solution in this model as compared
to other theories, as discussed below.

it is easy to check that for weak couplings the solutions (41) and (43) are in agreement with the used approximations.
note that there is no zero solution for the scalar vev in this large eld approximation. both, the minimum of the scalar
eld and the dynamically generated mass are driven by the external magnetic eld. as the dynamical fermion mass
breaks the discrete chiral symmetry (5) , this model might be considered as one more example of the phenomenon
of magnetic catalysis. however, if the current model is extended to include complex scalars (complex scalars do not
change at all the conclusions of this paper) and non-simple gauge groups, as su (2)  u (1) in the electroweak model,
the symmetry breaking phenomenon will have a dierent nature. there, we do not have chiral symmetry, but the
magnetic-eld-driven scalar minimum will break the gauge symmetry by giving mass to the gauge elds coupled to it.
thus, as we claimed at the beginning of the paper, in richer models with scalar elds, the magnetic eld can either
reinforce gauge symmetry breaking if it is already broken, or induce it, through non-perturbative eects.

comparing the induced fermion dynamical mass eq. (41) with the mass generated when no scalar eld is present

[12], [13], m p|gb| exp [2/g] , or with the one obtained when the couplings are ne-tuned so the scalar vev is set
to zero [16], m p|gb| exp(cid:20)2r1/(cid:16)g2 +
2 (cid:17)(cid:21) , one realizes that the scalar interactions, when taken into account
corresponds to a higgs mass of 115 gev, we nd m  0.6p|gb|. the same yukawa coupling, on the other hand, gives
just m  105p|gb| if the scalar vev is ne-tuned to zero [16]. in the case of pure gauge-fermion interactions, as for

in a self-consistent way, can dramatically strengthen the generation of mass. this observation is easy to corroborate
by direct evaluation of the mass (41) for typical values of yukawa coupling y and scalar self-coupling . for instance,
if we take y = 0.7, which is the approximate value of the yukawa coupling for the top quark, and  = 0.4, which

instance in qed, the generated mass would be even much smaller [12], [13].

a non-simple group extension of the model discussed in this work could be of interest as an eective theory in
condensed matter problems, where su (2) u (1) gauge theories (although without higgs elds) have been previously
proposed to describe the rich phase structure of high tc superconductors [21].
it seems, however, that the most immediate physical extension of the present model would be the electroweak
theory. this case is particularly interesting in the light of the recent works on the role of magnetic elds in electroweak
baryogenesis [6]- [10]. in view of the magnetic-eld-driven non-perturbative enlargement of the higgs vev, eq. (43),
it is possible that in the electroweak theory the increase in the scalar vev will be large enough to guarantee the
baryogenesis condition (1) . it remains therefore as an open question whether the eect found in this paper can
inuence the recent conclusions [6]- [10] about baryogenesis in the presence of primordial magnetic elds.
