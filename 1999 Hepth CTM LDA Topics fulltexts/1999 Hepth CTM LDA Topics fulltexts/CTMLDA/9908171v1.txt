abstract

this dissertation reviews various aspects of the n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory in
particular in relation with the ads/cft correspondence.
the rst two chapters are introductory. the rst one contains a description of the
general properties of rigid supersymmetric theories in four dimensions both at the classical
and at the quantum level. the second chapter is a review of the main properties of the
n =4 sym theory under consideration.

original results are reported in chapters 3, 4 and 5. a systematic re-analysis of the
perturbative properties of the theory is presented in the third chapter. two-, three- and
four-point green functions of elementary elds are computed using the component formu-
lation and/or the supereld approach and subtleties related to the gauge-xing are pointed
out. in the fourth chapter, after an introduction to instanton calculus in supersymmetric
gauge theories, the computation of the one-instanton contributions to green functions of
gauge invariant composite operators in the semiclassical approximation is reported. the
calculations of four-, eight- and sixteen-point green functions of operators in the super-
current multiplet are reviewed in detail. the nal chapter is devoted to the ads/scft
correspondence. some general aspects are discussed. then the attention is focused on
the relation between instantons in n =4 sym and d-instanton eects in type iib string
theory. the comparison between instanton contributions to green functions of composite
operators in the boundary eld theory and d-instanton generated terms in the amplitudes
computed in type iib string theory is performed and agreement between these two sources
of non-perturbative eects is shown.

this dissertation is based on research done at the department of physics of the uni-
versit`a di roma tor vergata, during the period november 1995 - october 1998,

under the supervision of prof. massimo bianchi and prof. giancarlo rossi. i would
like to thank them for introducing me to the arguments covered in this thesis, for all

what they have taught me and for their willingness and constant encouragement. i
also wish to thank prof. michael b. green for the very enjoyable and fruitful col-

laboration on the subjects reported in the last two chapters. i am grateful to yassen
stanev for many useful and interesting discussions. finally i thank the whole theo-

retical physics group at the department of physics of the universit`a di roma tor
vergata for the very stimulating environment i have found there.

note added

this thesis was presented to the universit`a di roma tor vergata in candidacy

for the degree of dottore di ricerca in fisica and it was defended in april 1999.
hence more recent developments are not discussed here and moreover the references

are not updated. however i cannot help mentioning at least the very detailed and
comprehensive review by o. arhony, s. gubser, j. maldacena, h. ooguri and y. oz
on large n field theories, string theory and gravity (hep-th/9905111), that is

not cited in the bibliography. actually this paper would have made my writing of
the last chapter much simpler if it came out earlier!

there are some direct developments of this thesis that have been carried on during
the last few months. in particular the analysis of logarithmic singularities in four-

point green functions and their relation to anomalous dimensions of un-protected
operators in n =4 sym has been nalised in collaboration with massimo bianchi,
giancarlo rossi and yassen stanev. this issue is only briey addressed in the con-
cluding remarks. the interested reader is referred to the paper on the logarithmic
behaviour in n =4 sym theory, hep-th/9906188.

chapter 1

rigid supersymmetric theories in
four dimensions

supersymmetry was introduced in [1] as a generalization of poincare invariance and
then implemented in the context of four dimensional quantum eld theory in [2].

the idea of a symmetry transformation exchanging bosonic and fermionic degrees of
freedom has proved extremely rich of consequences. although up to now there exists

no experimental evidence for supersymmetry, it plays a central role in theoretical
physics.

at the present day the interest in the study of supersymmetric theories relies on

one side on the role it plays in the construction of a more fundamental model beyond
the standard model of particle physics (sm) and on the other on the possibility of

deriving results that can hopefully be extended to phenomenologically more relevant
models.

the standard model describes the strong and electro-weak interactions within
the framework of a su(3)su(2)u(1) non-abelian gauge theory; despite the full
agreement with experimental data there are various motivations for believing that
it cannot be a truly fundamental theory. a rst problem arises in relation with the
grand unication of particle interactions. the gauge couplings are believed to be
unied at an energy scale of the order of 1016 gev. the standard model contains
many free parameters (masses and mixing angles) that must be ne-tuned in order

to achieve the grand unication (hierarchy problem): the problem follows from the

1

2

chapter 1. rigid 4d supersymmetry

existence of ultra-violet quadratic divergences and is solved in supersymmetric models

in which the divergences, as will be discussed later, are milder.

moreover the standard model does not include gravitational interactions: at

present the only consistent description of gravity at the quantum level is provided by
(super)string theories and supersymmetry appears to be a fundamental ingredient of

such theories.

in a more immediate perspective supersymmetric theories can be of help in un-

derstanding aspects of phenomenologically interesting models. for example a de-
scription of connement in asymptotically free theories as dual superconductivity
has been proposed and various realizations of this mechanism have been observed in

supersymmetric models.

more recently a correspondence between four dimensional quantum eld theories

and supergravity has been suggested; this particular subject appears very promising
and will be extensively studied in chapter 5.

this rst chapter contains a review of rigid supersymmetry in four dimensions.
the material presented is by no means original, the aim is to establish the notations

and to recall ideas and results, mainly about the quantization of supersymmetric
theories, that will be extensively used in the following.

in the rst part of the chapter the supersymmetry algebra and its realizations are

described. then the formalism of superspace is introduced in somewhat more detail
both at the classical and at the quantum level. the last section reviews general

properties of supersymmetric models.

an introduction to supersymmetry is provided by the books by p. west [3] and

j. wess and j. bagger [4] (whose notations will be followed in this thesis) and by
the review papers [5, 6]; superspace techniques are treated in more detail in [7];
for phenomenological aspects of supersymmetry see [8]; an extensive introduction to

superstring theory is given in the book by m.b. green, j.h. schwarz and e. witten
[9].

1.1 general supersymmetry algebra in four dimen-

sions

quantum eld theory models of interest for the description of fundamental inter-
actions combine the poincare invariance with the invariance under a global internal

symmetry group g. in [10] coleman and mandula proved, under general assumptions

1.1 supersymmetry algebra

following from the axioms of quantum eld theory, a no-go theorem that, states

that the most general symmetry group for a theory with non trivial s-matrix is the
direct product of the poincare group and an internal group g, which must be of the

form of a semisimple lie group times possible u(1) factors.

historically supersymmetry was discovered as an attempt to evade the constraints

of the colemanmandula no-go theorem .

the poincare group p=iso(3,1) is the semidirect product of the group t4 of four
dimensional translations and the lorentz group so(3,1); it is generated by p, m
satisfying:

[p, p] = 0
[p, m] = (p  p)
[m, m] = (m + m  m  m) .

(1.1)

(see appendix a for the conventions and a collection of useful formulas).

the generic internal symmetry group is a lie group dened by the commutation

relations:

[t a, t b] = if ab

ct c .

(1.2)

internal symmetries are supplemented by the discrete ones c, p and t.

the supersymmetry algebra is a graded extension of (1.1): the theorem of cole-
man and mandula is bypassed by allowing anticommuting as well as commuting

, q j that are weyl spinors transforming in the ( 1

generators.
in [11] the most general algebra allowed by this weakening of the hy-
pothesis of [10] was constructed: it contains, beyond (1.1) and (1.2), anticommuting
generators qi
2) repre-
sentations of the lorentz group respectively, so that they do not commute with the
generators p and m. here ,  = 1, 2 are spinor indices and i, j ranging from 1 to
n  1 label the various of supersymmetries.

2, 0) and (0, 1

the most general symmetry algebra of a supersymmetric quantum eld theory is

therefore given by (1.1) and (1.2) supplemented by

lorentz group; this implies that acting with qi
 or q j on a state of spin j produces
a state of spin j  1
2 : supersymmetry generators exchange bosonic and fermionic
states. reversing the line of reasoning and starting with a symmetry transforming the
elds among themselves in such a way as to mix bosons and fermions, one concludes

that the dierent physical dimension of bosonic and fermionic elds implies that the
transformation must involve derivatives, i.e. space-time translations. this gives an

1in principle the antisymmetry of z ij is expected to imply that no central extension can exist in
non extended (n =1) theories. it can be proved [12] that a central extension can actually be present
in n =1 supersymmetric yangmills theory. see [13] for a recent discussion in the context of the
ads/cft correspondence.

1.2 representations of supersymmetry

intuitive explanation of how the requirement of a non trivial mixing of internal and

space-time symmetries naturally leads to supersymmetry.

an immediate consequence of the supersymmetry algebra is that in supersym-

metric theories the energy is positive denite and vanishes only on supersymmetric
(ground) states. the rst equation in (1.3) implies

0 xi (cid:0){qi

1, (q1i)} + {qi

2, (q2i)}(cid:1) = 4n p0 = 4n h ,

so that

h|h|i  0

for every state |i and h|i = 0 if and only if q|i = 0, i.e. if |i is supersymmetric.

1.2 representations of the supersymmetry alge-

bra

the irreducible representations of the general supersymmetry algebra can be con-

structed starting from the (anti)commutation relations of the preceding section and
the denition of the casimir operators. for the poincare group the quadratic casimir
operators are p 2 = pp  and w 2 = ww , where w is the paulilubanski vector

w =

1
2

p m  .

here w 2 is not a casimir anymore, because m does not commute with the su-
 and q j, and is substituted by c 2 dened (for the case
persymmetry generators qi
n =1) by

c 2 = cc 
c = bp  bp
q  
b = w

 q .

the irreducible representations can be constructed by wigners technique of induced
representations.

a general result following from the supersymmetry algebra is that every irre-

ducible representation contains an equal number of bosonic and fermionic states.
dening the fermion number operator ()nf such that

()nf|bi = +|bi ,

()nf|fi = |fi ,

6

chapter 1. rigid 4d supersymmetry

where |bi denotes a bosonic state and |fi a fermionic one, it follows that

()nf q = q()nf ,

()nf q  = q ()nf .

these relations imply

so that in conclusion for non vanishing p

antisymmetry under the exchange of pairs (k, ik), (l, il) implies n  2n . for each

n the number of states (degeneracy) is(cid:18) 2nn (cid:19), so that the total number of states

(i.e. the dimension of the representation) is

d =

2nxn=0(cid:18) 2n

n (cid:19) = 22n .

the representation contains 22n1 bosonic and 22n1 fermionic states. the highest
spin state is obtained symmetrizing the maximum number of spinor indices, namely
n , leading to the value 1

d =

cpt invariance implies in general a doubling of the number of states because it re-
verses the helicity. so for example the n =3 multiplet in four dimensions coincides
with the n =4 multiplet if cpt invariance is required. multiplets of particular rel-
evance such as n =2 with  =  1
2 , n =4 with  = 1 and n =8 with  = 2 are
automatically cpt invariant.

supersymmetry representations in the presence of central charges.

for p 2 = m 2 in the rest frame p = (m, 0, 0, 0) the supersymmetry algebra with
non vanishing central charges is given by

j 

, q j} = 2mi
{qi
, qj
{qi
} = z ij
{q i, q j} =   zij ,

(1.11)

with z ij = z ji, zij = z ij. since z ij commute with all the generators, by invoking
schuurs lemma there exists a basis in which they are diagonal with eigenvalues z ij.
the antisymmetric n n matrix with elements z ij can be put in the following form

z ij = u i

k z kl(u t )l

j ,

with u is a unitary matrix and

z =   d
z = (cid:18)   d 0

0
1 0 (cid:19) and d is a diagonal n2  n2 matrix with eigenvalues zr,

where  = (cid:18) 0
such that zr = zr, zr > 0. considering the case with n even the algebra can be
rewritten in a more suitable form by decomposing the indices i and j as

(for n even)
(for n odd) ,

i = (a, r) ,

j = (b, s) ,

for zr < 2m r the structure of the multiplet is the same as in the case of no central

dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories as will be discussed later.

as an example of the previous construction consider the simplest case, namely

n =1 massive multiplet with a spin zero cliord vacuum |i: the states are

in the following the discussion will focus mainly on the n =4 massless case. for
a rigid supersymmetric theory with elds of spin not larger than one the multiplet
contains the following states with relative degeneracies

given the irreducible representations of the supersymmetry algebra the corresponding

realizations in terms of elds can be immediately deduced. although this was the
historical pattern in the construction of supersymmetric quantum eld theory models,

it appears more natural to derive the structure of supermultiplets using the supereld
formalism, so this will be the approach followed here.

notice that wigners method here employed gives representations of on-shell

states. it is always possible to construct sets of elds realizing such irreducible rep-
resentations, but on the contrary it is usually not possible, for n > 1, to achieve the
closure of the supersymmetry algebra on a set of o-shell elds, i.e. without use
of the equations of motion.

the irreducible representations of supersymmetry have automatically a well de-

ned transformation under the group of automorphisms of the algebra (1.3). for
massless representations the largest subgroup of the automorphisms group that re-
spects helicity is the whole u(n ), whereas for massive states it depends on the
in the absence of central charges, or if
presence and number of central charges.

none of them saturates the bps bound, the spin preserving automorphisms group is
usp(2n ). it reduces to usp(n ) for n even and to usp(n + 1) for n odd if one
central charge satises the condition z = 2m.

1.3 n =1 superspace

ordinary quantum eld theories are constructed in terms of eld operators that are
functions (actually distributions) dened on minkowskian space-time, parametrized
by the coordinates x. the action is required to be invariant under poincare space-
time symmetry as well as under transformations of an internal group g. the trans-
formation of a generic eld f (x) is of the form

r(g)f (x) = f ( (g)x) ,

(1.14)

with r(g) and  (g) suitable representations of the relevant symmetry group.

in supersymmetric models the space-time symmetry is extended by the intro-
, q j. the

duction of the transformations generated by anticommuting charges qi

1.3 superspace

11

natural way to implement the extended symmetry algebra is to construct the theory

in terms of generalized elds, called superelds [14, 15], depending on the coordinates
x as well as on fermionic coordinates  and  

f = f (x, ,  ) .

(1.15)

starting from the supersymmetry algebra a generic element of the corresponding
group of transformations can be written in the form

g(x, , ) = ei(xp+q+ q



) .

the action on superelds is then dened through a dierential representation of the

operators p, q and q

.

this construction can be carried out in a more general fashion, suitable for
generalization to the case of n -extended supersymmetry, dening the superspace
parametrized by

zm = (x, ,  )

as a coset space. n =1 superspace under consideration can be obtained as the coset
sp/l, where sp is the super poincare group generated by (1.3) and l is the lorentz
group so(3,1).

a coset group k=g/h can be parametrized by coordinates m, m = 1, . . . , (dim g

dim h). by writing an element of g through the exponential map

g = eimlmei khk ,

where the generators of g split into the generators of h (hk) and the remaining ln,
elements of the coset are obtained by taking  k = 0.

for the present case k=sp/l this implies that one should write

g = ei(ap+q+ q



)e

1
2 w m

(1.16)

so that w = 0 gives the elements of k

k = ei(xp+q+ q



) = ezmkm

which are parametrized by zm = (x, ,  ); as a result n =1 superspace is an eight
dimensional manifold. under the action of a group element g0 = (a, ,  )

g0  ezmkm = ezmkme

now comparison of (g1  g2) ezmkm with g1  (g2  ezmkm) allows one to prove that

as already mentioned a supereld is a function of zm

f (z) = f (x, , ) .

the transformation under the group action is the generalization of (1.14) that imple-
ments z =  (g)z with z given by (1.17). for innitesimal transformations

(1.19)

superelds dened in this way form linear representations of supersymmetry. since
supersymmetry acts on superelds through linear dierential operators it follows that

the product of superelds is a new supereld.

1.3 superspace

13

the objects considered up to now are scalar superelds 2; more general superelds
transforming in a non trivial way under lorentz transformations can be considered
as well. in general a supereld carrying a set of lorentz indices encoded in a single

label p transforms as

r(g)fp(z) = dp

q(cid:16)e 1

2 w m(cid:17) fq( (g)z) ,

where dq

p is a suitable representation of the lorentz group.

physical elds directly related to the states considered in section 1.2 can be ob-
tained from the superelds by expanding in the  and  variables. since  and  
are weyl spinors the expansion reduces to a polynomial. for a generic supereld

f (x, , ) = f (x) + (x) +

r(x) +

(1.20)

the elds f (x), (x), (x), g(x), h(x), r(x), (x), (x) and s(x) constitute a
supermultiplet and their transformation law is derived from the transformation of
the supereld by dening

f (x, , ) = f (x) + (x) +

(x) + g(x) +

and matching terms with the same powers of  and .

linear representations of supersymmetry constructed in this way are in general

reducible; the irreducible representations studied in section 1.2 are in correspondence
with constrained superelds. all the representations of rigid n =1 supersymmetry in
four dimensions are realized in terms of two basic superelds, namely chiral superelds
and vector superelds.

from now on the dierential operators  and   will be denoted as q and q 
like the abstract generators since they satisfy the same algebra. the operators q
and q  realize the left regular representation of supersymmetry on superelds, it is
useful to analogously dene the right regular representation realized by the dierential

operators

d =

d  =

satisfying

{d, d } = 2i
{d, d} = {d , d } = 0 .

 

d and d  are usually referred to as superspace covariant derivatives, actually they
can be obtained from the general expression for the covariant derivative in the coset
space sp/l: the fact that d and d  do not reduce to  and   despite the atness
of the n =1 superspace is a consequence of the presence of a non vanishing torsion.

chiral superelds.

chiral superelds are characterized by the constraint

d (x, , ) = 0 ,

which takes a particularly simple form expressing (x, , ), d and d in terms of the
variable y = x + i. as functions of y,  and  one gets

d =


 + 2i
 

 
y

d  = 





 ,

so that the general chiral supereld assumes the form

(y, ) = (y) + 2(y) + f (y) .

substituting y = x + i and expanding in  and  yields
(x, , ) = (x) + 2(x) + i(x) +

(x) +

+f (x)

2(x) .

(1.23)

analogously antichiral superelds are dened by

d(x, , ) = 0 .

the natural variable is y  = x  i; in terms of y 

 = (y, ) = (y) + 2(y) + f (y) .

1.3 superspace

15

the eld components associated to chiral and antichiral multiplets are of two

complex scalars (, f ) and one weyl spinor () corresponding to twice the number
of states in the massive on-shell n =1 multiplet of section 1.2.

products of (anti) chiral superelds are still (anti) chiral superelds. for example

ij = i(y)j(y) + 2[i(y)j(y) + i(y)j(y)] +
+[i(y)fj(y) + j(y)fi(y)  i(y)j(y)]

the product  is neither chiral nor antichiral. moreover since d3 = d
immediately follows that for a generic supereld f

notice that the double constraint d = d  = 0 implies that  is constant.

the supermultiplet contains two real scalars (c, d), one complex scalar (s), four
weyl spinors (, , , ) and one real vector (a). this is twice the content of the
massive n =1 multiplet obtained starting with a cliord vacuum of spin 1
2 and also
of the massless cpt invariant multiplet with minimum helicity  = 1.

since the vector multiplet contains a vector eld a(x) it is the basic ingredient
for the construction of supersymmetric gauge theories. the supersymmetric general-
ization of an abelian gauge transformation [16, 17] is

notice that the transformations for the lowest components c,  and s are purely

algebraic (no derivatives involved), so they can always be used to put these elds
to zero. this particular choice of gauge is known as wesszumino (wz) gauge.

subtleties related to the choice of the wesszumino gauge will be discussed in chapter
3. it is important to note that in this gauge one has

they are respectively chiral and antichiral:

d w = 0 ,

w [v +  + ] = w [v ] .

gauge invariance of w allows to compute its component expansion in the wess

1.4 n =1 supersymmetric models

the supereld formalism allows a straightforward construction of supersymmetric ac-
tions. the supersymmetry transformation of the ()  component (f -component)

of a (anti) chiral supereld is a total derivative, as can be deduced by specializing
(1.21) to the case of a chiral supereld, so that an action of the form 3

s =z d4x(cid:20)z d2  +z d2 (cid:21)

is automatically supersymmetric for an arbitrary chiral .

the same situation holds for the  component (d-component) of a vector

supereld yielding the supersymmetric expression

s =z d4xz d4 v ,

for all v s such that v  = v .

requirement of invariance under the group of automorphisms allows to further

restrict the possible couplings in the action for supersymmetric models; in this context
the symmetry under transformations of the group of automorphisms is referred to as
r-symmetry.

in appendix a.

this scalar potential in particular contains a 4 interaction and the mass terms for
the scalars k; actually the wesszumino model is the most general renormalizable
supersymmetric theory involving only chiral superelds.

the action (1.29) is the most general renormalizable supersymmetric action that
can be constructed in terms of only chiral superelds. more generally one can consider

an invariant action of the form

s =z d4x(cid:26)z d4 i i +(cid:20)z d2 w() + h.c.(cid:21)(cid:27) ,

where w() is a holomorphic function of  called superpotential. in this case the

1.4.2 supersymmetric gauge theories

gauge invariant interactions can be constructed in terms of vector superelds and
more precisely in terms of the supereld w dened in section 1.3, which contains
the gauge eld strength among its components.

given a chiral supereld  and a vector one v an abelian gauge theory is obtained

as follows. the gauge transformation for the chiral supereld is

k = eiqkk ,
 k = eiqkk ,

with

with

d  = 0
d = 0 ,

20

chapter 1. rigid 4d supersymmetry

where qk denotes the charge of the supereld k. the gauge parameter must be a
chiral supereld . supplementing these transformations with the following one for
the vector supereld v

v  = v + i(  ) ,

an invariant action can be written in the form

s = z d4x(cid:26)z d2

gijkijk(cid:19) + h.c.(cid:21)(cid:27)

(1.32)

invariance under the above dened transformations is immediately veried. notice
that the action (1.32) is non-polynomial: this a general feature of supersymmetric
gauge theories and is a consequence of the adimensionality of the vector supereld

v . choosing the wesszumino gauge reduces (1.32) to a polynomial form since it
implies v 3 = 0. this choice allows one to prove the renormalizability of the model.
the vector supereld v contains the gauge dependent components c,  and s
that can be put to zero by choosing the wesszumino gauge as well as the real

scalar d. the latter is an auxiliary eld since the corresponding equations of motion
obtained from (1.32) are purely algebraic.

this construction can be generalized to the non abelian case [19, 20]. for a

generic non abelian compact gauge group g the elds ,  and v are matrices.

()ij = t a

with generators t a of g satisfying

(cid:0)(cid:1)ij = t a

vij = t a

c(r) = dr being the dynkin index of the representation r.

and for the vector supereld

(1.33)

1.4 supersymmetric models

21

it can be proved that in this case as well it is possible to choose the wesszumino
gauge in which v 3 = 0.

for innitesimal gauge transformations use of the beckerhausdors formula

allows to write

v = v   v = ilv /2(cid:2)( +  + coth(lv /2)(  )(cid:3) ,

where la(b) = [a, b] is the lie derivative and (1.34) is a compact form to be
understood in terms of the power expansion of coth(l).

the non abelian generalization of the eld strength supereld w is

(1.34)

w =

in the wesszumino gauge the non abelian w has the same form as in (1.27) with

the transformation law of w induced by (1.33) is easily obtained and reads

f = a  a + ig[a, a] .

w  w  = eiwei ,

so that while in the abelian case w was gauge invariant for a non abelian gauge
group g it turns out to be covariant.

elds is therefore

the wesszumino condition is not supersymmetric so that it not only (partially)

a non linear realization given by equations (1.37). these transformations are more

precisely a mixture of supersymmetry and the residual non abelian gauge symmetry.
the choice of the wesszumino gauge leads to subtleties at the quantum level, as
will be discussed in chapter 3.

1.5 theories of extended supersymmetry

the most straightforward way to construct multiplets for theories with extended
(n > 1) supersymmetry is to assemble together n =1 multiplets in such a way as to

1.5 extended supersymmetry

23

obtain a eld content corresponding to the representations of section 1.2. it turns out

that in general this program can be achieved only on-shell; in other words it is not
possible to realize n -extended supersymmetry in a closed form through an o-shell
multiplet of elds. with the exception of n =2 supersymmetric yangmills theories
closure of the algebra without imposing the equations of motion would require an

innite set of auxiliary elds. this problem is related to the presence of central
charges in the supersymmetry algebra for n > 1.

as in the n =1 case the notion of superspace will be introduced to start with and

then explicit realizations in specic models will be considered.

1.5.1 extended superspace: a brief survey

the aim of this section is to give a brief account of ideas beyond the superspace

formulation for theories with extended supersymmetry, no claim of completeness is
made. in the following extended superspace will not be used in explicit calculations,

but it will rather be invoked to justify some statements. a detailed and self-contained
review of extended superspace is given in [21].

the general construction of superspace as a coset space introduced in section 1.3
can be generalized to dene extended superspace as the coset k=sp/l, where sp
is the extended super poincare group generated by the general algebra (1.1), (1.3)
and l is the lorentz group so(3,1). the generic element of sp can be written

just as in the case of n =1 superspace constraints dening superelds correspond-
ing to irreducible representations of supersymmetry are implemented through the

coordinates , so that the component supermultiplets contain an innite number of
elds; the only exception is the n =2 vector supereld dened by the condition

drv (x, , , ) =


 r v (x, , , ) = 0 .

(1.45)

as will be discussed in the next subsection the component elds associated to this
supereld are those dening the n =2 supersymmetric yangmills model.

n > 1 irreducible on-shell representations constructed in section 1.2 contain a
nite number of states (22n in the massive case and 2n in the massless case). the
reason for the appearance here of an innite number of component elds is that
closure of the supersymmetry algebra o-shell in the presence of central charges
requires innitely many auxiliary elds, the only exception being the n =2 super
yangmills multiplet related to the supereld in equation (1.45).

the n =2 supersymmetry algebra contains in principle two central charges, but
one of them can always be eliminated through a chiral rotation, so that the only

relevant anticommuting relation is

gauge theories.

1.5 extended supersymmetry

27

in general the constraints that need to be imposed on n > 1 superelds cannot
be explicitly solved for the whole supereld; in other words considering all the -
components yields a set of non independent elds. the lack of an explicit solution of

the constraints does not allow to exploit the potentiality of the superspace formalism
for extended supersymmetry, so that it does not prove so powerful a tool as in the
n =1 case.

these problems were partially solved in [22] by the introduction of harmonic su-
perspace. it is based on a parametrization of n =2 superspace as a homogeneous space
that leads to dierent bosonic coordinates associated to the central charges. use of
such coordinates allows to construct n =2 hypermultiplets in terms of unconstrained
superelds. a generalization of this approach leading to the so called analytic super-
space has been proposed in order to give a manifestly supersymmetric description of
n =4 theories (see the review [21] for the details), however it only works on-shell.

in the following all the explicit calculations using supereld formalism will be

carried out within the framework of n =1 superspace.
1.5.2 n > 1 supersymmetric models
in this section only examples of n =2 theories will be discussed, the general properties
of n =4 models, that are the main subject of this work, will be studied in detail in
next chapter.

n =2 supersymmetric yangmills model.

the supereld formulation of n =2 pure supersymmetric yangmills models is a
straightforward generalization of the n = 1 case because it is constructed in terms
of a n =2 supereld satisfying the constraint (1.45), which implies no dependence on
the central charges. since no central charges are present a full o-shell formulation
is possible. superspace in this case is parametrized by

zm = (x, i

,  j) = (x, ,  , ,  )

the starting point is a chiral supereld  dened by

d  = 0 ,

d  = 0

(1.51)

there is a natural choice of variables to describe , namely

y = x + i + i



28

chapter 1. rigid 4d supersymmetry

 can be expressed in terms of y as

(y, ) = (y, ) + i2w(y, ) +  g(y, ) ,

where  and g are n =1 chiral superelds and w is a chiral spinor supereld.

to construct a non abelian gauge theory  is taken to be a matrix

ij = t a

a n =2 supersymmetric action can then be written as

2(cid:12)(cid:12)2 2 = w w|2 + 2g|2 .

(1.52)

n =2 super yangmills is obtained by further constraining the chiral supereld g.
this is achieved by requiring  to satisfy

didj

 .

solving the constraint provides for g the following expression

g =z d2 (y  i, )ev (yi,) .

substituting into the general form (1.52) gives the action of n =2 super yangmills
theory. it can be viewed as a particular n =1 supersymmetric gauge theory coupled
to chiral matter, namely it corresponds to the case of one single avor in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group. supersymmetry does not allow a superpotential

for the model. integration over the  variables gives the component expansion. the
supereld  is a singlet under the su(2) r-symmetry group. the resulting component

multiplet obtained eliminating the auxiliary elds in the wesszumino gauge contains
a vector a and a complex scalar  that are su(2) singlets and two weyl spinors
(, ) that transform in the 2 of su(2). as already noticed, this eld content is what
would be obtained putting together a vector and a chiral n =1 supereld both in the
adjoint of the gauge group.

the most general n =2 action that can be constructed in terms of the supereld

 of equation (1.51) is

s =

where f is a holomorphic function of  called prepotential.

n =2 matter.

the n =2 super yangmills model can be generalized introducing the coupling to
matter described by hypermultiplets. hypermultiplets are associated to superelds
satisfying (1.49). a kinetic term for these superelds can be written in the form

sk =z d4x didj

(cid:2)i dkdk

j(cid:3) .

explicit dependence on the central charge does not allow a manifestly n =2 formu-
lation without resorting to harmonic superspace. anyway an on-shell action can be
constructed in terms of n = 1 superelds. denoting the two chiral superelds in the
hypermultiplet by q and q the action in n =1 language is given by

s =z d4x(cid:26)z d4hqe2v q + qe2v q + e2v i +

im(cid:20)z d2 w w(cid:21) +(cid:20)z d2(cid:16)2 qq + mi qiqi(cid:17) + h.c.(cid:21)(cid:27) .

+

(1.53)

the action (1.53) contains the ordinary kinetic terms, a mass term for chiral elds
in the hypermultiplet and a superpotential that couples q, q and . notice that
no potential term coming from a self interaction of the elds q and q is allowed by
n =2 supersymmetry. this follows from the observation that q and q are assembled
into a supereld i transforming in the 2 of su(2) r-symmetry and there exists no
trilinear invariant in su(2).

1.6 quantization of supersymmetric theories

the functional approach to the quantization of eld theories, based on the con-
struction of a generating functional for the time-ordered products of elds, can be

applied with no further diculty to supersymmetric theories in their component eld
formulation. however, although this formulation allows to extract all the peculiar
properties of supersymmetric theories at the quantum level, it makes rather obscure

how such properties are a direct consequence of supersymmetry. on the contrary a
quantization procedure can be carried out directly in superspace in a step by step

manifestly supersymmetric fashion. this approach, that allows to construct directly

30

chapter 1. rigid 4d supersymmetry

green functions for the superelds, has proved extremely powerful and it is perhaps

the most useful application of superspace techniques.

super feynman rules for the computation of green functions of the superelds

were rst proposed in [14] and then reformulated in a more powerful way in [23]. this
latter formulation will be reviewed here. once the green functions for the superelds

are known contact with the physical component eld formulation is established
by further integrating the fermionic coordinates (, ) to extract correlators for the

various components.

the discussion will focus on the quantization of n =1 superelds; it is also possible
to generalize the method to n -extended superspace, e.g. to harmonic superspace,
but the n =1 formulation appears to be the most suitable for application to explicit
calculations, even in the extended case.

1.6.1 general formalism

in ordinary quantum eld theories the path integral quantization is based on the
construction of a generating functional for the green functions. denoting by i the
generic elds of the model and by s[] the classical action the generating functional

is dened as

z[j] = nz [d] eis[]+ir dxi(x)ji(x) ,

where n is a normalization such that z[0] = 1 and ji(x) are external sources asso-
ciated to the elds i(x). green functions are obtained taking functional derivatives
with respect to the sources ji.

this approach has a natural extension that leads to a generating functional for

the green functions of the superelds in a supersymmetric theory.

the general form of the action of a supersymmetric theory involves, in n =1

language, chiral and vector superelds and can be written

s =z d4xd4 k(, , v ) +(cid:20)z d4xd2 w[] + h.c.(cid:21) .

(1.54)

to construct a generating functional classical sources for the dierent superelds

must be introduced, that are in turn superelds. since functional derivatives are to
be taken with respect to the classical sources, such sources must be arbitrary. a

problem arises with chiral superelds as sources coupled to them must themselves

1.6 quantization of susy theories

31

be chiral. this diculty can be solved by using a suitable denition of functional

derivatives with respect to chiral superelds.

for a generic supereld f (x, , ) functional derivatives are dened according to

the rule

f (x, , )
f (x, , )

= 4(x  x)4(  ) ,

where the  function of fermionic variables is to be interpreted as

4(  ) = 2(  )2(  ) = (  )2(  )2 ,

so that

and

f (x, , )z d4xd4 f (x, , )g(x, , ) = g(x, , ) .

given these denitions of functional derivatives the generating functional can be

written as

(1.56)

where s is the action (1.54), j (j) is a chiral (antichiral) source, jv is real and

(, j) = z d4xd2 (x, , )j(x, , ) ,
(v, jv ) = z d4xd4 v (x, , )jv (x, , ) .

green functions can then be calculated by the formula

classical elds

where on the right hand side j = j[ , , v ], j = j[ , , v ] and jv = jv [ , , v ]
come from the inverting (1.58).

the generating functional z can be expressed in terms of the corresponding func-
tional in the free theory, z0. the general action (1.54) can be divided up into a free
part and an interacting part

s[, , v ] = s0[, , v ] + sint[, , v ] ,

where s0 is quadratic in the elds and contains the kinetic and mass terms. then
one can write

of gauges that for the component eld a interpolate between the lorentz gauge
( = ) and the fermifeynman gauge ( = 1).

the free propagators for the ghosts are exactly the same as for ordinary chi-

ral superelds. furthermore there is a non polynomial interaction with the vector
supereld coming from the expansion of coth(lv /2).

the vector supereld propagator is calculated from the quadratic part of the

chapter 1. rigid 4d supersymmetry

a super feynman graph technique can be developed which is a straightforward gen-

eralization of what is done in ordinary eld theories. super feynman rules for the
evaluation of one particle irreducible green functions can be derived given the above

generating functional. the rules can be summarized as follows.

 to each external line is associated the corresponding supereld.
 at each vertex there is an integration over the whole superspace d4xd4; factors,
as for example powers of the coupling constant, to be associated to the vertices,
are read directly from the action.

 a factor of  1
4 d

4d2 acting on the internal chiral or antichiral lines
respectively must be included at each vertex. such factors come from the

or  1

denition of the functional derivatives. at purely chiral (antichiral) vertices one
factor of  1
4 d2) must be suppressed, because it is used to reconstruct
4d
the measure over the whole superspace.

( 1

2

 for internal lines the propagators previously derived are used.
 the specic form of the interaction at each vertex as well as the combinatoric

analysis are worked out exactly like in ordinary perturbation theory.

 the expressions for the one particle irreducible green functions in momentum
space are obtained by fourier transforming in the x variables, but not in the
fermionic  coordinates.

1.7 general properties of supersymmetric theories

supersymmetry has far reaching consequences in the quantum theory both at the
perturbative and at the non-perturbative level. some general results will be briey

recorded in this section. more can be found in the books and reviews quoted in the
references.

some dramatic eects on the divergences encountered in perturbation theory can
be easily derived from the feynman rules. explicit calculation shows that in feynman

diagrams four covariant derivatives are associated at each vertex, with the exception
of vertices involving external (anti) chiral lines that have two derivatives less. more-
over  () propagators with momentum p have an additional factor of d2
p2 ).

p2 ( d

1.7 general properties

37

simple dimensional analysis allows to compute the supercial degree of divergence ds
of a diagram which is

ds = 4l  2p + 2v  c  e  2l ,

where l is the number of loops, p the number of internal propagators, v the number
of vertices, c the number of  or  propagators and e the number of external
chiral or antichiral lines. use of the topological constraint l  p + v = 1 yields [24]

ds = 2  c  e .

for graphs with only external v lines gauge invariance requires the presence of four
d or d factors on the external lines so that the result is

for diagrams with only lines of a given chirality there are further factors of d2 or d
associated to the external lines so that one obtains

2

ds = c

ds = 1  c  n ,

where n is the number of external chiral or antichiral lines.

this calculation allows to determine all the potentially divergent diagrams. the
only possible divergences are logarithmic and can arise in diagrams with only external

v lines with c = 0 (e.g. corrections to the vector supereld propagator) and in
 propagators with c = 0. this shows that in supersymmetric models only
wave function renormalizations may be required; there is no direct mass or coupling
constant renormalization, i.e. with w = m2 one has zw = 1, but z 6= 1 implies
zm = z1/2



6= 1.

this and other results can be obtained from the general non renormalization
theorem for n =1 theories [25]: any perturbative quantum contribution to the eective
action  can be expressed as an integral over the whole superspace and is local in the
 variables, namely

 = xn z d4x1 . . . d4xnd4 g(x1, . . . , xn) 

fn[, , v, d, d , dv, d v, . . . ] .

(1.71)

the theorem can be easily proved using feynman rules and successively integrating by

parts the  variables exploiting the properties of grassmannian integration. explicit

38

chapter 1. rigid 4d supersymmetry

calculations in the n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory showing the mechanism
leading to this result will be presented in chapter 3, so the proof of the above statement
will not be discussed here.

notice that the non renormalization theorem does not forbid in principle quantum

corrections to the superpotential. it is easy to see that a contribution of the form of
(1.71) can produce a correction to the superpotential [26, 27]. as an example consider
a term of the form

where  is chiral. the right hand side, which follows since p1 = d
162 is the projector
on chiral superelds, has the form of a correction to the superpotential. this example

2

shows that in principle an arbitrary correction to the superpotential can be generated
perturbatively. this eect is related to an infrared singular behaviour that can be
present only in theories containing massless elds. the example shows that the

alternative approach to the study of this kind of eects has been given in [29, 30].

other non renormalization theorems hold for theories of extended supersymmetry.
in particular considerations based on the so called anomalies argument allow to prove
the niteness of n =2 theories beyond one loop. more precisely it can be proved that
the only perturbative contributions to the  function of extended supersymmetric
theories can come from one loop diagrams. this result allows to single out a class
of nite supersymmetric models and among them the n =4 super yangmills theory
that will be studied in detail in the following chapters.

supersymmetry puts severe restrictions on the non-perturbative properties as well.
a review of the general results on the non-perturbative dynamics of supersymmetric

theories is provided by [31, 32]. many astonishing results in this context can be traced
back to the properties of holomorphy of supersymmetric theories. in supersymmetric

models for example the superpotential is a holomorphic function of the chiral super-

elds. analogously, since the parameters of the theories (such as masses and coupling

constants) can be viewed as expectation values of auxiliary elds, various quantities
depend analytically on such parameters. using holomorphy properties many exact

result have been derived. in [33] an expression for the  function of supersymmetric
gauge theories was proposed that is exact at the perturbative as well as at the non-

perturbative level for a class of models. also on holomorphy relies the construction
of the exact solution for the low energy dynamics of a class of n =2 theories proposed
by seiberg and witten [34].

chapter 2

n = 4 supersymmetric yangmills
theory

four dimensional n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory is a very special quantum
eld theory.
it possesses several peculiar properties that will be reviewed in this
chapter. the general properties of the model are discussed here, original results in
the study of n =4 yangmills will be presented in the following chapters.

the action of the theory was given for the rst time in [35, 36] within the frame-
work of string theory toroidal compactications. the theory has the maximal amount

of supersymmetry for a rigid supersymmetric theory in four dimensions, namely six-
teen real supercharges; a larger number of supercharges would require elds of spin

larger than one and therefore the inclusion of gravity.

historically the interest in this model was raised by its property of niteness; the
 function of gell-mann and low has been proved to be vanishing in perturbation

theory and the same is supposed to be true at the non-perturbative level. as a con-
sequence the superconformal invariance displayed by the classical theory is believed

to be preserved after quantization.

moreover n =4 super yangmills theory possesses exact electric-magnetic duality.
it contains beyond the elementary elds an innite set of dyonic states which are
believed to realize exactly the duality symmetry proposed by montonen and olive in
[37].

more recently there has been a renewal of interest in n =4 yangmills theory

40

2.1 formulations of n =4 sym

41

following the proposal made by maldacena in [38] of a new duality relating type

iib supergravity in d + 1 dimensional anti-de sitter space and d dimensional (su-
per)conformal theories. this subject will be discussed in detail in chapter 5.

the present chapter is organized as follows. in section 2.1 the various formulations
of the model, which will be employed at dierent stages in the following, are reviewed.

section 2.2 presents the classical symmetries and conserved currents of the theory.
the properties of niteness are discussed in section 2.3. the nal section is then
devoted to electric-magnetic duality in n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory. the
general aspects of electric-magnetic duality are reported separately in appendix b.

2.1 diverse formulations of n =4 supersymmetric

yangmills theory

n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory in four dimensions was obtained for the rst
time in [35, 36] by applying the method of dimensional reduction to n =1 super yang
mills in ten dimensions. the latter is the low energy eective theory coming from
type i superstring theory and describes a n = 1 vector multiplet in ten dimensions
consisting of one real vector and one majoranaweyl spinor. the action is 1

dimensional reduction a la kaluzaklein on a six dimensional torus t 6 leads to

42

symmetry, which is a direct consequence of the ten dimensional lorentz invariance.
more precisely it is a consequence of the fact that the torus t 6 has a trivial holon-
omy group. in general in the dimensional reduction on a riemannian manifold of

dimension k the spin connection is a so(k) gauge eld and consequently the spinors
transform, upon parallel transport around a closed contractible curve, under a sub-
group of so(k), which is the holonomy group. in the case at hand of t 6 every spinor
is covariantly constant, so that the whole so(6)su(4) becomes a global symmetry
of the model. from the point of view of the n =4 theory this su(4) global symmetry
is identied with the r-symmetry group of the n =4 supersymmetry algebra, as will
be discussed in the next section.

in the bosonic sector the compactication gives rise to a four dimensional real
vector and to six real scalars from the internal components of the ten dimensional

vector. more precisely one denes

which contains six real scalars a ab satisfying (2.3), one real vector aa

 , all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. the construc-
tion here described from the ten dimensional theory allows to derive immediately
the transformation of the elds under the su(4) global symmetry. because of the
constraint (2.3) the scalars a ab are in the second rank complex self dual 6 of su(4);
the spinors aa are in the 4 while the

which can be easily obtained from the ten dimensional transformations (2.2) using

a manifestly o-shell formulation of n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory
would require the introduction of an innite set of auxiliary elds as a consequence

of the presence of bosonic coordinates associated to the twelve central charges in the
n =4 superspace, as noticed in [39, 40]. a supereld formulation can be constructed
using analytic superspace, however such an approach is rather involved and cannot

be applied to explicit calculations because it is intrinsically on-shell. an on-shell
supereld description can be given in terms of a supereld w ab = w ab(x, a
 ,  a)
satisfying [41] the reality condition

w ab =

(2.7)

44

chapter 2. n =4 super yangmills theory

together with the constraint,

 w bc = d[a
da

 w bc] ,

(2.8)

where d is the super-covariant derivative. the elds entering the action (2.5) are
combined into the lowest components of w ab.

in the next chapter perturbative calculations in n =4 yangmills will be carried
out using a formulation of the model in terms of n = 1 superelds. the eld content
of the theory can be obtained by taking one n =1 vector supereld v and three
n =1 chiral superelds i all in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. in
this approach the six real scalars are combined into three complex elds that are
the scalar components of the chiral superelds i, three of the weyl fermions are
the spinors of i and the fourth fermion is the gaugino that together with the real
vector constitute the vector supereld v . as a result only a su(3)u(1) subgroup
of the original su(4) symmetry is manifest in this formulation. more precisely the
representations of su(4) decompose according to 6  3+3, 4  3+1, so that the
chiral superelds i transform in the 3 of su(3), the antichiral i in the 3 and the
vector v is a singlet under su(3).

the action in the n =1 supereld formulation reads

(2.9)

where dr denotes the dynkin index of the representation to which the elds belong.
to recover the correct dependance on the coupling constant g one must substitute
v  2gv in the second term in (2.9).

the action (2.9) is non-polynomial as is always the case in supersymmetric gauge
theories in n =1 superspace. in particular the scalar potential of (2.5) comes from
the superpotential term

which of course can be made polynomial by choosing the wesszumino gauge which
implies v 3 = 0. in (2.10) the gauge xing term as well as the corresponding ghost
elds have been included following the prescription of (1.67) of chapter 1 and the
expansion has been truncated to the terms that will be relevant in future calculations.

integrating over the  variables and eliminating the auxiliary elds through the

equations of motion results in a dierent component eld formulation, which again
has a manifest su(3)u(1) global symmetry. such a formulation will be employed
in the next chapter in the discussion of subtleties related to the problem of gauge

xing in this model. choosing the wesszumino gauge one obtains

this formulation can be easily seen to be perfectly equivalent to (2.5) apart from the
the manifest r-symmetry, that is only su(3)u(1).

46

chapter 2. n =4 super yangmills theory

it is also useful to give a third component eld formulation of n =4 supersym-
metric yangmills theory in terms of n = 2 multiplets. this approach will actually
be used in instanton calculations in chapter 4. the n =4 super yangmills multiplet
decomposes in terms of n =2 multiplets into a vector plus a hypermultiplet. in this
description the subgroup of the original su(4) r-symmetry that is realized explicitly
is su(2)vsu(2)hu(1), where the subscripts v and h refer to the vector and hy-
permultiplet respectively: elds in the two multiplets are charged only with respect
to one of the two su(2) factors. the representations of su(2)vsu(2)hu(1) will
be denoted by (rv, rh)q with the subscript q referring to the u(1) charge and the
following notation for the component elds will be used

in conclusion of this review of the diverse formulations of n = 4 super yang
mills it is worth recalling that a truly o-shell analysis of the theory, in components
and in the wesszumino gauge, was given in [42] within the framework of algebraic

renormalization. the problems related to the necessity of including an innite set
of auxiliary elds are dealt with using the method of batalin and vilkoviski. this
approach, though technically rather involved, allows to prove that all the classical

symmetries of the theory survive quantization.

2.2 classical symmetries and conserved currents

the eld content of n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory described in the pre-
ceding section is unique apart from the choice of the gauge group g. in the abelian

case the theory is free as follows immediately by observing that all the elds belong

2.2 symmetries and currents

47

to the adjoint representation of the gauge group, so that all the covariant derivatives

reduce to ordinary ones if g is abelian, and all the potential terms are proportional
to the structure constants fabc.
in the non abelian case the theory has a moduli
space of vacua parameterized by the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of the six
real scalars, corresponding to a coulomb phase. the manifold of vacua is determined

by the condition of vanishing scalar potential (f -atness plus d-atness) which reads

tr(cid:0)[ab, cd][ab, cd](cid:1) = 0  tr(cid:0)[i, j][i, j](cid:1) = 0 .

by writing i explicitly in terms of generators of the adjoint representation one
obtains

1,6xi,j

dim gxa=1

2
ia2

jb tr(cid:0)[t a, t b](cid:1)2

= 0 ,

(2.14)

so that for a rank r gauge group g at most r components ia for each eld can
have non vanishing vacuum expectation value. as a result the space of vacua is
parameterized by 6r real coordinates. the moduli space is

m = r6r/sr ,

(2.15)

where sr is the group of permutations of r elements, because congurations in which
two or more components of i are exchanged are physically indistinguishable. in con-
clusion the manifold m is a 6r-dimensional real space with orbifold type singularities.
in a generic point of the coulomb phase with nonvanishing vevs for the scalar
elds the gauge group g is broken to u(1)r, so that the theory is again abelian and
thus free. on the contrary the origin of the moduli space, where the vevs of all the

scalars vanish, corresponds to a phase that is expected to describe a highly non trivial
superconformal eld theory. note that the superconformal phase corresponds to an
orbifold singularity of the manifold m.
in this phase the classical action (2.5) is
actually invariant under a larger group of global transformations than that generated
by the super poincare algebra (1.3), namely the n =4 superconformal group.

the n -extended superconformal algebra in four dimensions is an extension of
(1.3) which includes additional generators d, k, si
 and s i corresponding respec-
tively to dilatations, special conformal transformations and the associated special

supersymmetry transformations. the complete algebra further includes the follow-

the operator a in these relations is the generator of the u(1) factor of the group
u(n )=su(n )u(1) of the automorphisms of the algebra. the n =4 case is singular
since it implies

[qi

, a] = [q i, a] = 0 .

the chiral rotation operator a must therefore have the same action on all the
states in the multiplet. this implies in particular that it must act in the same way
on states of opposite helicities  1
2, which is possible only if a is actually zero.

2.2 symmetries and currents

49

for this reason the r-symmetry group in the n = 4 case is su(4) and not u(4) as
would be expected from general arguments.

as already noticed in section 2.1 a su(4)so(6) global symmetry, that is identi-
ed with the r-symmetry, naturally arises in the compactication on t 6 that leads
to n =4 super yangmills in d = 4 from the ten dimensional n =1 theory. in this
context the reduction of the global symmetry from u(4) to su(4) is understood as
a consequence of the lack of a real six dimensional representation in u(4). more
precisely it follows from the form of the yukawa coupling a[
b, ab] in the ac-
tion (2.5). in fact a transformation, under the u(1) factor contained in u(4), of the
type   ei for the spinor would require ab  e2iab for the scalars which is
prohibited by the reality condition (2.3).

the noether currents associated with the superconformal transformations to-

gether with those corresponding to chiral su(4) r-transformations are components
of a unique on-shell multiplet [43]. the complete multiplet of currents was given for

the abelian case in [44]. the conserved currents are

2.3 finiteness of n =4 supersymmetric yangmills

theory

the rst argument suggesting the possibility that the n =4 supersymmetric yang
mills theory could be a nite theory at the quantum level, free of ultraviolet as
in that paper within the study of
well as infrared divergences, was given in [19].

the general problem of the coupling of scalar (chiral) multiplets to vector multiplets
it was observed that a number of three chiral multiplets in a supersymmetric yang

mills theory would lead to a gell-mann and low  function vanishing in the one-loop
approximation. in fact for a gauge group g=su(n) the one loop  function is given

by

 = 

g2
162 (3  n)n ,

where n is the number of chiral multiplets coupled to the vector multiplet in the n =1
language.

successively this result was improved in [45], where the same was shown to hold

at the two loop level by an explicit computation in the component eld formulation.

2.3 finiteness of n =4 sym

51

further improvement of this result beyond two loops proves extremely complicated

using ordinary techniques based on feynman rules for the component theory. there
exist a computer calculation [46] of the three-loop  function performed by using

ordinary feynman rules which gives a vanishing result as well.

superspace techniques allow to derive this result in a much simpler way as was
shown in [23, 47, 48]. the basic ingredient is the observation that a vertex coupling

three chiral superelds is nite as a direct consequence of dimensional analysis. by
applying the rules of section 1.7 the supercial degree of divergence of a green func-
tion with three external (anti) chiral superelds is negative, d = 2  3 = 1, i.e.
the diagram is nite. this means that the  function is completely determined by

the wave function renormalization constant calculated from the divergent part of the
propagator of, say, the chiral supereld. the equation for the  function [48] is

(g) =

g2 z (1)

is the coecient of the simple pole term in the fourier transform of the

chiral supereld propagator. calculations presented in the papers of references [47,
48] show that the propagator of the chiral supereld is nite, in the supersymmetric

generalization of the fermifeynman gauge (=1 in the notation of section 1.6),
up to three loops, implying the vanishing of the  function at the same order in

perturbation theory.

the lack of manifest n =2 supersymmetry in the calculations described up to now
prevents from using the non renormalization theorem for n =2 in order to extend the
result to every order. a formulation based on unconstrained n = 2 superelds (which
is basically a version of harmonic superspace) was developed in [49]; such an approach
allows a description of n =4 super yangmills with manifest n =2 supersymmetry.
the niteness of the theory at all orders in perturbation theory is then a consequence
of the n =2 non renormalization theorem once the absence of divergences is proved
at one loop.

another proof of the niteness of the theory was given in [50] using a light-cone
superspace formulation. the advantage of this formulation relies on the fact that

only physical elds are involved so that no auxiliary elds are necessary, however the
lack of lorentz invariance introduces other diculties and makes the interpretation

of the results less transparent.

a dierent approach based on anomaly arguments has been presented in [51].

52

the vanishing of the  function is obtained as a consequence the superconformal

invariance since (see [52])

, immediately gives
so that invariance under dilatations, implying the vanishing of t
(g) = 0. the problem is therefore the proof of superconformal invariance, which is
obtained as a consequence of the su(4) symmetry being preserved at the quantum

level. as already remarked a dierent demonstration of superconformal symmetry
was given in [42] using somewhat more general arguments.

all of the results here discussed either apply to gauge invariant quantities or are

obtained avoiding possible subtleties related to the choice of the gauge. as will be
discussed in the next chapter subtleties are actually present in the calculation of

non gauge invariant quantities such as green functions both in the component eld
formulation and in the description in terms of n =1 superelds.

2.4 s-duality

during the last few years the concept of duality has been the basic ingredient for
striking results in the analysis of the non-perturbative behaviour of supersymmetric

gauge theories as well as of superstring theories. the fundamental idea of dual-
ity is that of a transformation relating two dierent and somehow complementary

descriptions of a physical system. the role that duality plays in the study of the
non-perturbative properties of a physical model relies on the possibility of construct-

ing a transformation that maps the non-perturbative regime of the system into the
perturbative regime of the dual system. examples of this kind of duality have been
known for a long time; in particular the duality shown by kramers and wannier [53]

in the case of the 2-d ising model and that established between the sine-gordon and
the thirring models [54, 55] appear very representative.

the two dimensional ising model is dened by a set of spin variables i taking
values 1 and living on a two dimensional square lattice. the interaction is restricted
to nearest neighbours and the partition function reads

z(k) =x{}

expkx(i,j)

ij ,

(2.20)

2.4 s-duality

53

where k is related to the temperature t and the ferromagnetic coupling constant j
through k = j/kbt (kb being boltzmanns constant). in (2.20) the sum on {} is
over all spin congurations and the sum on (i, j) is over all pairs of nearest neighbours.

the model was explicitly solved by onsager and exhibits a single phase transition to
a ferromagnetic state at a critical temperature tc. kramers and wannier computed
the critical temperature by using duality arguments, before the exact solution of the
model was found. the crucial point is that the theory can be reformulated in a

dierent (dual) way by writing the partition function as a sum over the elementary
plaquettes of a dual lattice whose sites are the centers of the plaquettes of the original
one, with a new coupling k. the two descriptions are then equivalent, namely
z(k) = z(k), if the couplings are related by

sinh 2k =

1

sinh 2k

.

notice that this implies that the high temperature (or weak coupling) regime, k  1,
of the original description is mapped by the duality transformation to the low temper-
ature (or strong coupling) regime, k  1, of the dual system. the computation of
the critical temperature is based on the hypothesis that the system has a single tran-
sition point. the critical point must then be the self-dual point of the transformation,
k = k, which gives sinh[2j/kbtc] = 1.

a second interesting example of duality occurs in two dimensional relativistic eld
theory and relates the sine-gordon and the thirring models. the sine-gordon model

is dened by the 2-d action

ssg =z d2x(cid:20) 1

2

 +



2 (cos   1)(cid:21) ,

(2.21)

where  is a scalar eld and the parameter  plays the role of a coupling constant

as can be established by power expanding the potential term. the spectrum of the
theory contains meson excitations of mass mm =  and solitonic states with
mass ms = 8
2 . therefore the solitonic degrees of freedom have large mass in the
weak coupling regime. it can be shown that the sine-gordon model is completely
equivalent to the thirring model which describes a system of interacting fermions.

the action of the latter is

st =z d2xhi + m 

st can be mapped into the action (2.21) through bosonization [54, 55]. more precisely
it can be proved that the duality transformation maps the soliton of the sine-gordon

model into the elementary fermion of the thirring model and the meson states of

(2.21) into fermionanti-fermion bound states. the relation between the coupling
constants is

so that in this case as well duality establishes a strong/weak coupling correspondence.

the crucial role that duality plays in the context of supersymmetric gauge theo-

ries relies on this fundamental feature. the kind of duality that is relevant in four
dimensional quantum eld theories is a generalization of the electric-magnetic duality
introduced for the rst time by dirac in [56]. the general features of electric-magnetic

duality are reviewed in appendix b, where the case of the georgiglashow (or yang
millshiggs) model is described. the application to the n =4 super yangmills
theory is discussed in this section. there are various reviews on electric-magnetic
duality, see in particular [58, 59, 60].

2.4.1 montonenolive and sl(2,z) duality

most of the analysis of this section will be carried out for a su(2) gauge group,

but the results can be generalized to larger groups. the classical spectrum of non
abelian gauge theories can contain non-perturbative states associated with solitonic

solutions of the equations of motion. the corresponding eld congurations are
characterized by a topological charge that is interpreted as a magnetic charge, so
that these states describe monopoles and in general dyons (states with both electric

and magnetic charge) [61]. as discussed in appendix b the georgiglashow model

monopoles m, that is summarized in the following table

montonen and olive have suggested in [37] that a duality transformation exchang-
ing electric states associated to w  bosons and magnetic states associated to
monopoles m and at the same time electric and magnetic charges could be an exact
symmetry of the full quantum theory in the bps limit. the exchange of electric and

magnetic charges implies, because of the dirac quantization condition (see appendix
b),

e  g =

4
e

,

so that the proposed symmetry is intrinsically non-perturbative.

the conjecture of [37] is based on the classical spectrum and on the following
arguments. first of all the mass formula (2.24) is invariant under duality as can be

easily checked. moreover a semiclassical analysis [63] based on the so called moduli

56

chapter 2. n =4 super yangmills theory

space approximation (to be discussed in the nal subsection) shows that the inter-

action between two monopoles vanishes, whereas there is an attractive interaction
between monopoles and anti-monopoles. the duality symmetry would require that
the same should be true for the w  bosons. it can be proved at the semi-classical level
that this is indeed the case because the repulsive interaction between equal charge

w bosons is exactly cancelled by an identical contribution due to the exchange of
scalars, that are massless in the bps limit.

there are some basic problems with the montonenolive proposal, namely

 quantum corrections are expected to spoil the results of the semi-classical anal-

ysis. in particular a non-vanishing potential v () could be generated.

 the elementary w  bosons have spin one while the monopoles that should be
related to them by the duality have spin zero, making an exact matching of the

quantum numbers impossible.

 the role of the dyons has been neglected in the previous analysis.

it will be shown that all of these problems can be solved in supersymmetric theo-
ries. in particular the n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory is supposed to realize
exactly a generalization of the montonenolive duality called s-duality. this gener-

alization emerges when the eects of a non-vanishing vacuum angle are taken into
account. in the presence of a -term (see the end of section b.2) the lagrangian of

the georgiglashow model can be written

furthermore at  = 0 the duality of montonen and olive becomes

2.4.2 s-duality in n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory
the general properties of the n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory previously
discussed allow to give an intuitive explanation of why it is considered the original

example of a theory possessing exact s-duality.
in the coulomb phase for each
scalar with non-vanishing vev the same construction leading to the t hooftpolyakov
monopole (see the appendix) can be carried on. as a result the classical spectrum

contains monopoles and dyons as well. unlike the case of the georgiglashow model
the niteness of the theory makes the semiclassical analysis of the spectrum sensible

even at the quantum level. moreover the theory has the correct number of fermions in

58

chapter 2. n =4 super yangmills theory

the adjoint representation to give spin one dyon/monopole congurations through the

mechanism sketched in section b.3. more precisely, in the case of a su(2) gauge group
being discussed here, creation and annihilation operators ai
, with i = 1, 2,
associated with the fermionic zero modes can be dened so that the spectrum of
zero-energy states, in the charge-one monopole sector, consists of the following states

where |i is the magnetic charge-one cliord vacuum. the multiplet generated in
this way contains sixteen states: eight bosons (six spin 0 scalars and two spin 1
vectors) and eight spin  1
2 fermions. as a result the spin quantum numbers of the
monopole multiplet exactly match those of the multiplet of elementary elds.

furthermore in extended supersymmetric theories the bogomolnyi bound comes
as a consequence of the supersymmetry algebra, so that it holds in the full quantum

theory. in supersymmetric models a vanishing scalar potential in correspondence of
non trivial scalar eld congurations is perfectly natural because of the presence of
at directions. in the case of n =4 super yangmills this scalar eld conguration
corresponds to a generic point of the coulomb phase.

the relation of the bps limit with the supersymmetry algebra is better under-
stood in the n =2 case. the n =2 supersymmetry algebra possesses two central
charges which are related to the magnetic and electric charge operators of the theory
[65]. using a majorana notation, the n =2 algebra contains the anticommutator

{qi

, qj

} = ij

p + u ij + (5)v ij ,

i, j = 1, 2 ,

2.4 s-duality

59

where the central charges have been denoted by u ij and v ij. by expressing u ij and
v ij in terms of the elds of the theory olive and witten have proved the relations

u ij = ijvqe ,

v ij = ijvqm ,

where qe and qm are the electric and magnetic charge operators respectively, that
generalize those in equation (2.23). in the previous equation v2 = htr (s2)i+htr (p 2)i,
where s and p denote the complex higgs elds of the model. as a consequence of
this relation the bogomolnyi bound follows directly from the supersymmetry algebra
because of the positive deniteness of the operator {q, q} in the rest frame.

in the n =4 case the situation is more involved because there are twelve central
charges. correspondingly there are six electric and six magnetic charge operators
associated to the six scalars, i, of the n =4 multiplet

where v2 =p6

and can be saturated only by states annihilated by exactly one half of the super-
charges. the bps states which saturate the limit correspond to short multiplets of
the n =4 superalgebra and for this reason are protected in the full quantum theory.
the mass of the bps states is completely determined by their electric and magnetic
quantum numbers and is exact because supersymmetry is preserved at the quantum

level.

all the bps states in the spectrum can be displayed on six two-dimensional lattices

(one for each couple of charges qi

e and qi

m) and lie at points of coordinates

supersymmetry implies that the bps states in the spectrum can only decay into

a couple of bps states, so that a generic state of mass m is unstable if and only if
there exist bps states of masses m1 and m2 such that

m  m1 + m2 .

60

chapter 2. n =4 super yangmills theory

figure 2.1: lattice of bps states

it immediately follows that stable bps states are all and only those which have
integer quantum numbers ne and nm that are coprime. these are the states marked
by empty circles in gure 2.1, while the full circles denote unstable states.

thanks to the fact that the bps states are protected by supersymmetry in the
n =4 theory a semi-classical analysis of the spectrum is sensible at the quantum level
as well. some arguments supporting the conjectured s-duality of the n =4 super
yangmills theory based on the moduli space approximation are briey reviewed in

the next subsection.

2.4.3 semiclassical quantization

in appendix b it is discussed how to construct a classical solution of the equations of
motion describing a monopole in the georgiglashow model, the aim of this section

is to show how the semiclassical quantization of the monopole solution can be used to
study the spectrum of the model [63, 66]. the notion of collective coordinates will be
introduced starting with the t hooftpolyakov monopole and then the semiclassical
quantization will be applied to the n =4 super yangmills case. a readable review
of these topics is provided by [67].

in the bps limit the monopole solution satises the bogomolnyi equation ba

i =
dia (i = 1, 2, 3, a = 1, . . . , dim g). given a eld conguration solving this equation
in general one can nd a multi-parameter family of solutions with the same energy.

2.4 s-duality

61

the parameters labeling the degenerate solutions are called moduli or collective co-

ordinates of the monopole and the corresponding space moduli space.

for the t hooftpolyakov monopole described in appendix b three collective coor-

dinates are associated with the translational invariance of the bogomolnyi equation.
given a solution (acl a

(~x), cl a(~x)) the eld conguration

(2.34)

where ~x is a constant vector, still satises the equation and has the same energy
(and magnetic charge). thus the three coordinates ~x are moduli.

a fourth collective coordinates is related to gauge transformations. gauge invari-

ance implies that the functional space of physical eld congurations is

c = a/g ,

i , a) and g is the group of small gauge transformations, i.e. gauge
where a = (aa
transformations that do not reduce to the identity at spatial innity. large, or

global, gauge transformations which do not approach the identity at innity are
true symmetries of the theory and so eld congurations related by large gauge trans-
formations are inequivalent. the bps solution for the t hooftpolyakov monopole is
symmetric under the diagonal so(3) subgroup of so(3)rsu(2)g, where so(3)r is
the group of spatial rotations and su(2)g the group of large gauge transformations,
but it is not invariant under su(2)g. as a result by acting with the u(1) subgroup
of su(2)g that is not broken in the higgs vacuum one generates a new solution with
the same energy, so that the fourth collective coordinate is associated with the u(1)
group of global electromagnetic transformations. by letting ~x depend on time one
(~x+ ~x(t)), cl a(~x+ ~x(t))). since the hamiltonian
describes a moving monopole, (acl a

the time dependence of ~x generates a non vanishing electric eld so that the kinetic
energy increases while the potential energy remains constant. this is a general feature

of a motion in the moduli space. one can then consider a general deformation of a

the fourth collective coordinate. for  6= 0 a non-vanishing kinetic energy is gen-
erated. moreover  is periodic since it parameterizes a compact u(1) (it is a sub-
group of su(2)g), therefore the moduli space with coordinates ( ~x, ) is topologically
m1 = r3  s1.

the previous construction of the moduli space can be generalized to a charge k
monopole solution. a rigorous derivation of multimonopole solutions is quite involved
[68], the resulting moduli space mk is 4k-dimensional and roughly speaking the
4k collective coordinates correspond to the locations of the k monopoles and their

dyon degrees of freedom. on physical grounds the existence of multimonopole bps
congurations is related to the fact that the repulsion between monopoles of the same
charge can be compensated by an attractive interaction mediated by the massless

higgs eld, thus allowing the construction of static congurations.

for a charge k monopole deformations (aa

i , a), with  = 1, . . . , k, satisfying
the linearized bogomolnyi equations and the gauss law constraint dene tangent
vectors to mk. given the tangent vectors the standard metric on mk can be con-
structed as

g = z d3x tr(cid:0)aiai + (cid:1) .

(2.39)

this metric is actually induced by the form of the action for the gauge theory in c
as can be seen by writing the monopole solution as acl
i (~x, z), cl(~x, z), where zs

2.4 s-duality

63

denote the moduli. the tangent vectors (ai, ) are calculated by dierentiating
with respect to the z. in general one has to include a gauge transformation to ensure
that (ai, ) are tangent to the moduli space of physical elds, i.e. that the elds
ai = acl
i + aiz,  = cl + z belong to the space c. the general form of
the tangent vectors is

ai =

z  e[cl, ] ,

where (~x, z) is a suitable gauge parameter that is xed by requiring that the lin-
earized bogomolnyi equation (2.36) and the gauss law constraint (2.37) be satised.
the action of the theory on the bps conguration is then obtained after substituting

chapter 2. n =4 super yangmills theory

the preceding arguments can be extended to the case of the n =4 super yang
mills theory to nd stronger evidence for the exact s-duality of the model. in order to
be able to use the previous considerations the simplest case will be considered, namely

the gauge group will be taken to be g=su(2), broken by the vacuum conguration

h2i = h3i = . . . = h6i = 0
htr2i = v2 .
h1i =  ,

the perturbative states in the bosonic sector of the theory, labeled by quantum
numbers (nm, ne) consist of a massless photon multiplet with charge (0, 0) and massive
w boson multiplets with charge (0,1). the tower of stable bps states predicted
by s-duality have charges (l, k) (with l and k coprimes) and can be studied within

the framework of semiclassical quantization since they can be put in correspondence
with certain geometric structures on mk. then the non-renormalization properties
of the theory make the semiclassical result reliable in the full quantum theory.

in the georgiglashow model mk is parameterized by 4k collective coordinates
which are bosonic zero modes. in the n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory there
are fermionic zero modes as well in the monopole background and the index theorem
of [71] shows that the number of such zero modes in the charge k sector is precisely

4k. as a consequence the moduli space has fermionic coordinates too and the low
energy ansatz to be substituted into the bogomolnyi equation is given by (2.40)

supplemented by

(~x, t)  (t)cl(~x, z(t))

(2.43)

for the weyl spinors in the monopole background.

in equation (2.43) the ansatz

for the spinors (~x, t) has been schematically written as the product of a c-number
cl(~x, z) satisfying a zero mode equation in the monopole background and a time
dependent fermionic collective coordinate (t). the zero modes can be shown to
constitute a short multiplet preserving half of the supersymmetries just like is ex-
pected for bps states. the exact ansatz for the elds is rather complicated and was

discussed in detail in [69]. a technically involved computation allows to derive the
quantum mechanical action to be employed in the semiclassical analysis. the action

reads

monopole moduli space is a hyper-kahler manifold, s in equation (2.44) is invariant
under the action of eight real supercharges. the quantization of the supersymmetric

quantum mechanics (2.44) was performed in [70], where it was shown that the states
can be put in one to one correspondence with dierential forms on mk and the
hamiltonian of the system h can be expressed in terms of the exterior derivative
acting on forms. this construction leads to a basis of sixteen independent forms
that are eigenstates of h in the nm = k = 1 sector. these states constitute a bps
multiplet as can be veried by a computation of the corresponding quantum numbers.
the complete wave functions contain a plane wave factor from the bosonic sector of
the form ei ~p ~xeine so that again one nds a tower of states with qe = ne + e
2 . these
states all saturate the bogomolnyi bound and therefore are exactly those predicted

by s-duality.

for nm = k > 1 the problem is much more complicated. the moduli space is

mk = r3  (s1  m0

k)/zk ,

where m0
k is a 4(k  1)-dimensional hyper-kahler manifold. the states are tensor
products of forms on r3  s1 with forms on m0
k, |si = |, nei  |i 2. the forms
|i can be proved to be unique and much in the same way as in the k = 1 case there
are sixteen forms |, nei for all k that give rise to a bps multiplet. the resulting

states carry electric charge qe = nee + nm
the unique form |i for the case k = 2 has been explicitly determined by sen in [72].
arguments suggesting a possible generalization to k > 2 were given in [73].

2there are actually further subtleties related to the zk identication.

perturbative analysis of n = 4
supersymmetric yangmills theory

as discussed in the previous chapter, the n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory
has been proved to be nite at the perturbative level up to three loops and strong

arguments have been proposed in order to extend this result to all orders and even
non perturbatively. for this reason the theory has long been considered to be rather

trivial. however recent developments, within the context of the correspondence with
type iib superstring theory on anti de sitter space, that will be studied in the nal
chapter, have shown that it is actually an extremely interesting superconformal eld

theory, possessing very peculiar properties.

even in perturbation theory a careful analysis allows to point out various problems

mostly related to the choice of gauge. both in the component eld formulation and
using n =1 superelds the gauge xing procedure appears very subtle. as will be
discussed in detail in both cases one nds divergences in o-shell green functions.

in the component formulation the propagators of the elementary elds are ul-

traviolet divergent in the wesszumino (wz) gauge and these innities are exactly
cancelled when the contributions of the gauge-dependent elds, that are put to zero
in the wz gauge, are taken into account. the choice of the wz gauge, that is

almost unavoidable in explicit computations, introduces divergences that require a
wave function renormalization. this is a general result that applies to theories with
less supersymmetry as well, but appears particularly dramatic in the n =4 case be-

66

67

cause the theory is nite, so that the divergences cannot be reabsorbed through a

redenition of the bare parameters.

dierent problems emerge in the formulation of the theory in terms of n =1 super-
elds. almost all the calculations showing the vanishing of the quantum corrections
to two- and three-points functions that are presented in the literature were performed

in the supersymmetric generalization of the fermifeynman gauge (=1 in the no-
tation of section 1.6). with a dierent choice of gauge two and three point functions

develop infrared singularities of dicult interpretation, leading to the result that the
choice =1 is somehow privileged. this conclusion was proposed for the rst time
in [74] and then it was discussed in the case of the n =4 theory in [75]; however no
possible explanation was proposed. unlike those of the elementary elds the correla-
tion functions of gauge invariant composite operators, that play a crucial role in the

correspondence with ads type iib supergravity/superstring theory, should not suer
from problems related to the gauge xing.

also, it will be discussed, in the supereld formulation, the eect of the intro-
duction of a mass term for the chiral superelds, which breaks supersymmetry from
n =4 down to n =1. it will be shown that this deformation of the model does not
modify the ultraviolet properties of the original theory. this result was rst proposed
in [76], where it was proved that the inclusion of mass terms for the (anti) chiral su-

perelds does not generate divergent corrections to the eective action. it will be
argued that this statement can be reinforced, showing that, at least at one loop, no

new divergences, not even corresponding to wave function renormalizations, appear
as a consequence of the addition of the mass terms. this result supports the claim
put forward in [77, 78], where the mass deformed n =4 theory was proposed as a
supersymmetry-preserving regularization scheme for a class of n =1 theories. it will
also be argued that the same approach should work in the case of n =2 theories.

all of this problems are examined in detail in this chapter. section 3.1 deals with
the diculties introduced by the choice of the wesszumino gauge when the com-

ponent formalism is used. the subsequent sections report calculations performed in
the n =1 supereld formalism of two-, three- and four-point functions. the material
presented in this chapter is an original and systematic re-analysis of the perturbative
properties of n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory, the treatment follows closely
[79].

chapter 3. perturbative analysis of n = 4 sym theory

3.1 perturbation theory in components: problems

with the wesszumino gauge

throughout this chapter calculations will be carried on in euclidean space-time and

unless otherwise stated the gauge group will be taken to be su(n). to discuss per-
turbation theory in components in this section the formulation of equation (2.11),
with a su(3)u(1) subgroup of the su(4) r-symmetry group manifest, will be em-
ployed. to correctly deal with the lower components of the vector supereld v , that
are put to zero in the wesszumino gauge, it is however useful not to eliminate the

auxiliary elds f and d through their equations of motion, but rather keep them in
the action: in the computation of green functions the corresponding x-space prop-

agators are simply -functions. the complete expression for the vector supereld v
was given in equation (1.24) and contains beyond the physical elds, a and , and
the auxiliary eld, d, the gauge-dependent elds c,  and s. note that the scalar
eld c and the spinor  have wrong physical dimension, resulting in non standard
free propagators, as will be shown. the non abelian eld strength supereld w is

the expansion of v  and v 2 in the supereld action. the latter generates
tadpole type diagrams in the propagator hi, but not in hi. the interaction

in conclusion beyond the ordinary propagators for the physical elds, , ,  and
a, and those for the auxiliary elds, f and d, one further obtains the propagators
hssi, hcdi, hi and hi. the latter are not present in the wesszumino gauge.

3.1.1 one loop corrections to the propagator of the fermions

belonging to the chiral multiplet

the one-loop correction to the propagator of the fermions i in the chiral multiplet
is the simplest to compute. in the wz gauge there are three contributions at the one
loop level, that will be shown to lead to a logarithmically divergent result.

from the action (3.5), (3.6), with c==s=0 one obtains the following three

equation (3.14) shows that a logarithmically divergent wave function renormalization

this divergence will now be proved to be a gauge artifact due to the choice of the

must be taken into account, which correspond to the diagrams

so that the one-loop correction to the hi propagator, if the wesszumino gauge is
not exploited to perform the calculation, is zero, as expected in n =4 super yang
mills theory.

notice that the insertion of tadpoles such as

in a diagram gives a vanishing result because all the propagators are diagonal in
colour space, so that the tadpole contains a factor abf abc  0. the same is true also
for diagrams in n =1 superspace that will be discussed in subsequent sections.

3.1.2 one loop corrections to the propagator of the scalars

belonging to the chiral multiplet

the calculation of the propagator hi is more complicated because more diagrams
are involved. in particular tadpole type graphs, coming from the term v 2 in the

3.1 perturbation theory in components

75

action, are present. however the result is analogous to what was found for the hi
propagator:
in the wz gauge the one-loop correction is logarithmically divergent,
requiring a wave function renormalization, but when the contributions neglected in

the wz gauge are considered the total one-loop result is vanishing.

the diagrams contributing to hi at the one-loop level in the wesszumino

gauge are the following

the last three diagrams are all tadpole corrections since the free propagators for the

auxiliary elds f and d are -functions, so that the corresponding lines shrink to a
point. each of these diagrams is quadratically divergent. there is also a quadratically

divergent contribution coming from the two diagrams b(x, y) and c(x, y) and the
sum of all these terms exactly vanishes. the sum of the previous diagrams gives a

nal result that is logarithmically divergent and in momentum space is schematically

single diagrams contain quadratically divergent terms that cancel in the sum leav-

ing a total contribution that is again logarithmically divergent. this non-vanishing
correction is exactly what is needed to cancel the divergence in (3.17). as a result
the complete one-loop correction to the hi propagator is zero, whereas in the
wesszumino gauge a wave function renormalization is required.

notice that the situation induced by the choice of the wz gauge is a feature
common to every supersymmetric gauge theory, since the contribution of the gauge-
dependent elds c,  and s is in general logarithmically divergent. however in theo-

ries with less supersymmetry a logarithmic wave function renormalization is usually
necessary in any case, so that this eect is completely irrelevant. on the contrary
it becomes important in the n =4 yangmills theory and in general in nite theo-
ries. of course the divergences encountered here are gauge artifacts and disappear

in gauge invariant correlation functions. examples of computations of correlators of
gauge invariant operators, in which the choice of the wz gauge does not lead to this
kind of problems, will be considered within the discussion of the correspondence with

ads type iib superstring theory in the nal chapter. note also that the divergences
encountered in the propagators are zero on-shell.

the calculations described here seem to suggest the possibility of constructing
improved feynman rules in which the eect of the gauge dependent elds, neglected in

the wz gauge, is dealt with by a suitable redenition of the free propagators. however
this program proves extremely complicated when the propagators of elds in the
vector multiplet or three- and more-point functions are considered. the calculation

of these correlation functions requires, already at the one-loop level, many other
terms to be included in the action sint. in particular terms coming from w (1)w (2)
and w (2)w (2) must be considered. the calculation of w (2) without the simplications

introduced by the wesszumino gauge is rather lengthy and gives

substituting (3.18) into sint results in a number of relevant interaction terms of the
order of 100, making this formulation totally impractical in explicit calculations. in

conclusion perturbation theory in components requires almost unavoidably the wz
gauge, but the latter introduces divergences in gauge dependent quantities. in the
following sections the supereld formalism, that allows to avoid these problems, will

be employed. however as will be shown new diculties related to the gauge xing
emerge.

3.2 perturbation theory in n =1 superspace: prop-

agators

the diculties encountered in the previous section in the calculation of gauge depen-
dent quantities, because of the divergences introduced by the wesszumino gauge,
can be overcome using the n =1 supereld formulation of the model.

in chapter 2 it has already been pointed out how the n =1 supereld formalism
has proved to be a powerful tool in the proof of the niteness of the theory up to

three loops. in this approach there is no particular diculty in working without xing
the wz gauge. if one does not choose to work in the wz gauge the action is non

polynomial, however a nite number of terms is relevant at each order in perturbation

80

chapter 3. perturbative analysis of n = 4 sym theory

theory, so that only at very high order the wesszumino gauge introduces signicant

simplications. the aim of this section is to show that there are other subtleties
related to the gauge xing, even if one does not work in the wz gauge.

the formulation of the theory in n =1 superspace that will be employed is a mass
deformed version of that given by equation (2.10). in other words the action that

will be considered is that of equation (2.10) plus mass terms for the (anti) chiral
superelds

the addition of this term to the action breaks supersymmetry down to n =1. in [76] it
was argued, by means of dimensional arguments, that this term should not aect the
ultraviolet properties of the n =4 theory. more precisely the statement of [76] is that
no divergences appear in gauge invariant quantities, so that no divergent contribution

to the quantum eective action is generated perturbatively. as a result the model
obtained in this way would be an example of a nite n =1 theory. the inverse
construction, in which one deforms a n =1 model to n =4 super yangmills plus a
mass term, has been proposed in [77, 78] as a regularization procedure preserving
supersymmetry. the calculations presented in this section will show that in the

presence of the term (3.19) no divergence is generated, at the one-loop level, in the
two-, three- and four-point green functions that are computed. the results presented
suggest the possibility of reinforcing the conclusions of [76]; namely the n =4 theory
augmented with (3.19) appears to be nite in the sense that no divergences appear

in the total n-point irreducible green functions, at least at one loop. in particular no
wave function renormalization is required. notice that this result is what is actually

necessary for the consistency of the approach advocated in [77, 78].

where the dots stand for terms that are not relevant for the considerations of this
chapter.

notice that in the action (3.21) a gauge xing term corresponding to a family
of gauges parameterized by  = 1
 has been introduced. it will now be shown, by
explicitly computing the propagators of both the chiral and the vector superelds,
that the supersymmetric generalization of the fermifeynman gauge, corresponding
to  = 1, is somehow privileged (see also [75, 80]), since any other choice of the

parameter  leads to infrared divergences in green functions.

3.2.1 propagator of the chiral supereld

the propagator of the chiral supereld is the simplest green function to compute.

the calculation will be reported in detail in order to illustrate the supereld tech-
nique.

it follows from the action (2.10) that there are three diagrams contributing to the
propagator hi at the one loop level. the one-particle irreducible parts of these
diagrams will be directly evaluated in momentum space using the super feynman
rules of section 1.6. the convention employed is that all momenta are taken to be

incoming. the diagrams are the following

chapter 3. perturbative analysis of n = 4 sym theory

to summarize the results, the propagator of the chiral superelds of the n =4
super yangmills theory in n =1 superspace is logarithmically infrared-divergent for
any choice of the gauge parameter  6= 1. this divergence corresponds to a wave
function renormalization for the superelds i and vanishes on-shell. in the fermi
feynman gauge =1 the one-loop correction exactly vanishes.

3.2.2 propagator of the vector supereld

the one-loop calculation of the propagator of the vector supereld is much more

complicated, because many more diagrams are involved producing a large number
of contributions. the nal result is however completely analogous:
in the fermi

feynman gauge the one-loop correction is zero, whereas infrared divergences arise
for  6= 1. in the presence of a mass term for the (anti) chiral superelds no new
divergences are generated.

form a calculational viewpoint the new feature with respect to the hi case
is that there are also diagrams involving the ghosts. there are two multiplets of
ghosts, described by the chiral superelds c and c. the free propagators for these
superelds will be denoted by

the ghosts are treated exactly like ordinary chiral superelds with the only dier-
ence that there is a minus sign associated with the loops, because c and c are
anticommuting elds [23].

schematically the calculation goes as follows. a(p) is a contribution that appears
because of the addition of the mass terms (3.19); it is not present in the n =4 the-
ory, i.e. when m=0. it is useful to discuss separately the corrections coming from
diagrams a, b and c and those obtained from di, ei, f and g, since the latter
correspond to the one-loop contribution to the vector supereld propagator in the
n =1 supersymmetric yangmills theory.

notice that in particular the logarithmically divergent contribution proportional to

a mass renormalization for the vector supereld that is known to be excluded in any
gauge theory as well as in supersymmetric theories in general.

the diagrams di and ei are completely analogous to the previous ones, with the
only dierence that the mass does not appear in the denominators and there is a

any , so that only e needs to be considered. this diagram produces in principle 72
corrections because the feynman rules give rise to 18 terms (distributing the covariant
derivatives associated with the two vertices), each of which splits into 4, since the

free propagator itself contains two terms. many of these contributions can be easily
shown to vanish using the properties of the covariant derivatives. in particular one

but is ultraviolet nite. furthermore there is a correction, nite both in the ultraviolet
and in the infrared regions, proportional to 2, that reads

j (2)(p) = c22g2a

in the previous expressions for j (1) and j (2) c1 and c2 are non-vanishing numerical
constants proportional to n(n 2  1).

in conclusion in the n =4 theory, i.e. when m=0, the one-loop correction to the
vector supereld propagator, just like that of the chiral supereld, is infrared singular
unless the fermifeynman gauge, =1, is chosen, in which case it vanishes. like in

the case of the chiral supereld propagator the non-vanishing -dependent corrections
correspond to a wave function renormalization for the supereld v and are zero on-
shell, i.e. for p2=0.

the proof of the niteness of the theory in the presence of the mass terms (3.19)

given in [76] is based on naive power counting, which gives the supercial degree of
divergence, ds, of a diagram in n =1 superspace [24]
ds = 2  e  c ,

where e is the number of external (anti) chiral lines and c the number of  or
 propagators. in [76] it is also argued that for corrections to the eective action
involving only v superelds the requirement of gauge invariance reduces the degree

of divergence to

ds = c .

however for the purposes of [77, 78] it appears crucial that no divergences, not even
corresponding to a wave function renormalization, are present in total n-point func-

tions for any n. the computation of the two-point functions in this section has shown

92

chapter 3. perturbative analysis of n = 4 sym theory

that this actually the case at one loop. an argument for the generalization of this

result to green functions with an arbitrary number of external v lines will now be
briey discussed. first note that diagrams involving only vector and ghost super-

elds are not modied by the inclusion of (3.19), so that one must only consider
graphs containing internal chiral lines. the ultraviolet properties of diagrams that
are only logarithmically divergent in the original n =4 theory are not modied by the
presence of the mass in the propagators. thus the contributions to be analyzed are

the quadratically divergent ones, that can acquire subleading logarithmic singulari-
ties, plus eventually new diagrams involving  and  propagators. the relevant
quadratic divergences come from tadpole diagrams

v an

v bn

v a2

v a1

v b2

v b1

the only new diagram containing  and  propagators that must be considered
is

v an

v bn

v a2

v a1

v b2

v b1

since all the vertices entering these graphs come from the expansion of the term

tr(cid:2)ev ev (cid:3) in the action, the only covariant derivatives that are present come

from the functional derivatives and must act on the internal (anti) chiral lines to give
a non-vanishing result. as a consequence the loop integral in the above diagrams
is exactly the same as for the c and a corrections to the v v propagator. hence

3.2 propagators in the n =1 formulation

93

summing to the previous diagrams the contribution of

v an

v bn

v a2

v b1

leads to a net logarithmically divergent correction that is exactly the same as the
one obtained in the original n =4 theory. like in the latter case this divergence will
be cancelled by the contributions coming from the other one-loop diagrams involving
v and ghost internal lines. the argument given here reinforces the results of [76],

at least at the one-loop level, and supports the proposal, put forward in [77, 78],
according to which the mass deformed n =4 model can be considered a consistent
supersymmetry-preserving regularization for a class of n =1 theories.

notice that for the previous discussion it is not necessary to consider equal masses

for all the (anti) chiral superelds. the same results can be proved giving dierent
masses to the three superelds. this can be easily understood since in each diagram
considered in this section only one chiral/anti-chiral pair is involved, because the

propagators are diagonal in avour space and the vertices containing vector and
(anti) chiral superelds couple i and i with the same index i. basically this
means that the above discussed cancellations apply separately to the contributions of
each (anti) chiral supereld. from the viewpoint of the dimensional analysis of [76]
having dierent masses mi is irrelevant.

as a consequence one can in particular give mass to only two of the (anti) chiral
multiplets. this suggests the possibility of generalizing the approach of [77, 78] to
the case of n =2 super yangmills theories. a discussion of the eect of a n =2 mass
term in n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory can be found in [81].

3.2.3 discussion

the infrared divergences found in the calculation of the propagators of the chiral and
the vector superelds are due to the fact that the vector supereld is dimensionless,

so that it contains in particular, as its lowest component, the scalar c that is itself

94

chapter 3. perturbative analysis of n = 4 sym theory

dimensionless and hence has a propagator which behaves, in momentum space, like

h(cc)(k)i 

1
k4 .

the contribution of the scalar c to the hv v i propagator leads to an infrared diver-
gence whenever a diagram contains a loop involving a v v line. in the fermifeynman
gauge the problem is not present because the choice  = 1 gives a kinetic matrix of
the form of equation (3.9) in the component expansion. the corresponding inverse
matrix m1 in (3.10) shows that no hcci free propagator is present. on the con-
trary any choice  6= 1 produces such a propagator, i.e. gives a matrix m1 with
a non-vanishing (m1)11 entry, leading to the previously discussed problems. an
explicit calculation in components with  6= 1 and without xing the wesszumino
gauge should show problems with infrared divergences analogous to those encountered
here. these problems with infrared divergences are not peculiar of the n =4 super
yangmills theory, but appear in any supersymmetric gauge theory. analogous in-

frared divergences in green functions have been observed in [80, 82]. the conclusion
proposed in these papers is that there exist no way to remove the infrared diver-

gences, so that the choice =1 is somehow necessary, at least for the computation of
gauge-dependent quantities.

there are two general theorems concerning infrared divergences in quantum eld
theory. the rst is the kinoshitaleenauenberg theorem [83], which deals with

infrared divergences in cross sections. it states that no infrared problem is present in
physical cross sections of a renormalizable quantum eld theory, if the appropriate
sums over degenerate initial and nal states, associated with soft and collinear parti-

cles, are considered. the second theorem was proved by kinoshita, poggio and quinn
[84] and concerns green functions. the statement of the theorem is that the proper

(one-particle irreducible) euclidean green functions with non-exceptional external
momenta are free of infrared divergences in a renormalizable quantum eld theory. a
set of momenta pi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n is said to be exceptional if any of the partial sums

pi ,

xii

with i a subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} ,

vanishes. the reason for the absence of divergences is that the external momenta, if

non-exceptional, play the role of an infrared regulator in the green functions.

the proof of the theorem is based on dimensional analysis which does not work in
k4 propagator. in particular it fails in the case of supersymmetric

the presence of a 1

3.2 propagators in the n =1 formulation

95

gauge theories in general gauges, because the adimensionality of the v supereld
implies that factors of 1
k4 can enter the loop integrals. the apparent violation of the
kinoshitapoggioquinn theorem can be understood from the viewpoint of the com-

ponent formulation: supersymmetric gauge theories, being non-polynomial and thus
containing an innite number of interaction terms, are not formally renormalizable.

the choice of the wesszumino gauge makes the theory polynomial. in fact in this
case no infrared divergence is found in green functions and the general theorems are
satised. however in the case of the n =4 theory the choice of the wz gauge results
in a change of the ultraviolet properties of the model, at least for what concerns gauge
dependent quantities, e.g. the propagators.

in theories with less supersymmetry, in which ultraviolet divergences are present
the problem might seem less severe, since the subtraction of the ultraviolet innities

could cure also the infrared singularity.

the infrared problems discussed here are however gauge artifacts and cannot af-
fect gauge invariant quantities. the mechanism leading to the cancellation of infrared

divergences in gauge independent green functions has not been veried in detail yet,
but can be understood starting from the super feynman rules. when the propaga-
tor hv v i is inserted into a feynman graph it is connected to vertices which carry
covariant derivatives. these derivatives come directly from the form of the action for

vertices involving only v elds and from the denition of the functional derivatives
for vertices involving (anti) chiral superelds. the situation in diagrams for gauge in-
variant quantities is such that at least one covariant derivative can always be brought

to act on the v propagator by integrations by parts. in this way an additional factor
of the momentum k is generated in the numerator. more precisely for the infrared
problematic term  1

a rigorous and general check of this mechanism in gauge invariant green functions

has not been achieved yet.

3.3 three- and four-point functions of n =1 super-

elds

the computation of green functions with three and four external legs will now be
considered. from now on the fermifeynman gauge will be xed. the three-point

functions should in principle suer from infrared problems of the kind encountered
in the preceding section. this claim will not be studied here since the calculation
with  6= 1 is awkward, even at the one-loop level, because of the huge number of
contributions. four-point functions on the contrary should be infrared nite, because
they are directly related to physical scattering amplitudes. notice, however, that in-

frared divergences in the green function with four external v lines were found in [82].
in that paper beyond the infrared singularity, it was shown that the adimensional-

ity of the supereld v implies that it requires a non-linear renormalization, i.e. the
renormalized eld vr is a non-linear function of the bare eld v

vr = f (v ) .

an example of three-point function will be briey discussed here and then the

more interesting case of a four-point function will be studied in greater detail.

3.3.1 three-point functions

the simplest three point function to consider corresponds to the correction to the

vertex ijktr(cid:0)ij k(cid:1) (or ijktr(cid:16)ij k(cid:17)), which is determined by one single

diagram at the one loop level. however as a less trivial example of computation of
three-point functions the one-loop correction to the vertex

j

b (z)

ai (z)

vc(z)

 (cid:16)ai v ci

b(cid:17) (z)

will be considered here. the correction at the one-loop level comes from the following

diagrams (the notation for the propagators is the same as in the previous section)

in the presence of a mass term for the (anti) chiral superelds the expressions given
above are modied by the presence of the mass in the free propagators and further-

more there are two additional sets of contributions corresponding to the diagrams

the calculation of these diagrams is completely analogous to those that were pre-
sented in the previous section. all of these proper contributions can be derived using
the feynman rules. the last two diagrams are nite and vanish in the n =4 theory,
i.e. at m=0, as they are proportional to m2; they will not be considered here. the
other contributions will be briey studied in the limit m  0.

the diagram d(p, q) is zero as a consequence of the contraction among the colour
indices, so that there are ve contributions to be calculated. the dimensional analysis
of section 1.7 gives a vanishing supercial degree of divergence, corresponding to a

logarithmic divergence, for the green function under consideration. each diagram
actually contains a logarithmically divergent term plus nite terms. a straightforward

but rather lengthy computation, based on elementary d-algebra, allows to prove that

3.3 three- and four-point functions

the divergent part of all the diagrams is of the form

ilog = c i

where c1 and c2 are numerical constants. the sum of all the logarithmically divergent
terms contained in the diagrams a, b, c, e and f vanishes. the residual nite part
can be shown to be zero as well. in conclusion the one-loop correction to the three-
point function hv i exactly vanishes in the fermifeynman gauge. the same
result can be shown to hold for the other three-point functions.

the supereld formalism does not lead to signicant simplications in the calcu-
lation of three-point functions with respect to the same computation in components

(in the wesszumino gauge!); actually for the green function considered here the
number of diagrams to be evaluated is approximately the same in the component

formulation. however the power of superspace techniques becomes clear in the com-
putation of four-point functions that will be considered in next subsection.

3.3.2 four-point functions

the computation of four-point functions in components is awkward even at the one-

loop level and in the wesszumino gauge. in this case the choice of the wz gauge
should not lead to divergences because the complete four-point function must nally
give the physical scattering amplitude. in the n =1 supereld formulation the calcu-
lation of four-point functions, though rather lengthy, is much more simple.

in this section the computation of the one-particle irreducible one-loop correc-
tion to the green function hi in the fermifeynman gauge will be presented.
there are several diagrams to be considered: each of them is free of ultraviolet di-

vergences, as immediately follows from dimensional analysis. moreover in the fermi
feynman gauge the single corrections are infrared safe.
in conclusion one nds a

nite and non-vanishing result.

chapter 3. perturbative analysis of n = 4 sym theory

in the presence of a mass term for the (anti) chiral superelds the expressions

both of these graphs give corrections proportional to m2, that can be calculated much
in the same way as the previous ones.

with a dierent choice of gauge the computation of four-point green functions is

more complicated. single diagrams involving vector supereld propagators contain
new contributions, some of which are infrared divergent. the correction c is not zero
anymore, because there are projection operators acting on the -functions. moreover

further diagrams must be included in the calculation at the same order as a conse-
quence of the non-vanishing of the one-loop correction to the vertices. for example

one must consider diagrams such as

the techniques illustrated in this chapter for the calculation of green functions
in the n =1 formalism can be applied to correlation functions of composite operators
as well. green functions of gauge invariant composite operators such as those that
form the multiplet of currents (equations (2.17) and (2.18)) play a crucial role in the

correspondence with type iib superstring theory on ads space to be discussed in
chapter 5. the application of n =1 superspace to this problem will be sketched in
the nal chapter. it can be shown that the extension of the formalism to the case of

composite operators is rather straightforward, the fundamental dierence being that
the complete green functions and not the proper parts must be considered.

chapter 4

nonperturbative eects in n = 4
super yangmills theory

in the last chapter the quantum properties of n =4 supersymmetric yangmills the-
ory have been analyzed at the perturbative level, this chapter is devoted to the study
of some non-perturbative eects.
instanton calculus will be employed to compute

various green functions of gauge invariant composite operators in the semiclassical
approximation.

it is well known that in gauge eld theories non-perturbative eects can modify
in a dramatic way the perturbative structure of the vacuum. instanton calculus has

proved to be an extremely powerful tool in the analysis of non-perturbative phe-
nomena in quantum eld theories, particularly in the case of supersymmetric gauge

theories. the role of instantons in yangmills theories was pointed out in [85] at
the classical level and then at the quantum level in a fundamental work by t hooft

[86]. instantons are non trivial nite action solutions of the classical euclidean equa-
tions of motion of the model. the computation of green functions in the instanton

background allows to study non-perturbative properties of the quantum theory. in
non-supersymmetric non abelian gauge theories the contribution of instantons to
green functions turns out to be divergent in the semiclassical approximation [86].

however in the supersymmetric case explicit instanton calculations can be performed
leading to nite and well dened results, thanks to the cancellation between fer-

mionic and bosonic quantum uctuations. compensations of quantum eects due

108

109

bosons and fermions take place in the instanton background and allow to explicitly

compute vacuum expectation values (vevs) of composite operators (condensates).
these cancellations are reminiscent of boson and fermion compensations in internal

loops at the perturbative level. the condensates play the role of order parameters in
non-perturbative phenomena such as for instance the spontaneous breaking of chiral

symmetries or even of supersymmetry in certain models [87]. furthermore instanton
calculus together with holomorphy properties, has allowed to derive some exact re-

sults in supersymmetric theories [33] and, more recently, to obtain non trivial checks
of the exact result proposed in [34].

as was discussed in previous chapters supersymmetric gauge theories typically
possess a moduli space of vacua parameterized by the vevs of scalar elds. the

literature on instanton eects in asymptotic free theories includes examples in which
the computations are performed with zero vevs for all the scalars [87] as well as

examples in which non vanishing vevs for the scalar elds parameterizing the moduli
space are considered [88]. the n =4 super yangmills theory has a (exactly) vanish-
ing -function and a moduli space of vacua, m=r6k sk, where k is the rank of the
gauge group and sk the group of permutations of k elements, parameterized by the
vevs of six real scalar elds, hii. the superconformal phase, corresponding to the
origin of m, i.e. hii=0, i, cannot be obtained naively as the limit of the theory
in the coulomb phase. in this chapter the approach of [87] will be applied to the

computation of various condensates corresponding to operators in the supermultiplet
of currents (2.17), (2.18). four-, eight- and sixteen-point functions of bilinear oper-

ators belonging to the current supermultiplet will be computed in the semiclassical
approximation in the case of a su(2) gauge group. in particular the exact complete
spatial dependence will be determined for a four-point function at lowest order.

due to the vanishing of the -function and of the associated chiral anomalies, the

correlation functions that will be studied, unlike the cases encountered in theories
with less supersymmetry, receive a non-vanishing perturbative contribution as well.

these green functions will reconsidered in the nal chapter in the context of the
correspondence with type iib superstring theory compactied on ads5  s5. it will
be shown that the diculties encountered in perturbative calculations in chapter 3
do not aect the computations discussed here.

the chapter is organized as follows. the general features of instanton calculus in
supersymmetric gauge theories are briey discussed in sections 1, 2 and 3. sections
4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 report on original results in the case of n =4 supersymmetric yang

mills theory, following [89]. the nal section describes the generalizations of the

results of [89] to the case of a su(n) gauge group and to the k-instanton sector in
the large n limit, that were given respectively in [90] and [91, 92].

4.1 instanton calculus in non abelian gauge theo-

ries

in this section the semiclassical quantization in the background of an instanton con-
guration will be reviewed for the case of a pure yangmills theory. the extension

to fermions will be discussed in the next section.

in quantum eld theory one is interested in computing vacuum expectation values
in

of operators o(), that in general are polynomials in the elementary elds .
euclidean space one must calculate

ho(x1, . . . , xn)i =z [d]e s[]

 o((x1), . . . , (xn)) ,

(4.1)

where the dependence on  has been explicitly indicated in order to discuss the
semiclassical approximation.

the classical vacuum of the theory corresponds to a constant expectation value
hi for the elementary elds and a perturbative series is obtained expanding the
interaction part of the action s[] for small uctuations, , around the classical
vacuum. in instanton calculations one considers a situation in which there exists a

non-trivial solution of the classical equations of motion with nite euclidean action.
denoting by  such a eld conguration one can then study quantum uctuation
around  =  in the limit   0. putting

(x) = (x) + (x) = (x) + 1/2(x)

and expanding s[] in powers of  in the form

notice that in principle one could consider a classical solution  with innite eu-

clidean action, but this would give a vanishing contribution in the semiclassical ap-
proximation because of the factor es[]/ in (4.2).

4.1.1 yangmills instantons

the classication of non-trivial solutions of the classical euclidean equations of mo-
tion for the yangmills system has been given in [85], where an explicit solution

has also been constructed. another (multi-center) solution has been proposed by
t hooft, who also studied the semiclassical quantization [86]. the case of a su(2)

gauge group will be discussed rst and then the extension to su(n) will be sketched.

the euclidean yangmills action is

sym[a] =

4drg2z d4x tr (ff ) ,

(4.3)

where the gauge eld a and the eld strength f are respectively

a = aa

 (x) = (x) [a(x) + i] (x) ,

with (x) = eia(x)t a.

the study of nite euclidean action congurations is performed much in the
same way as for the monopoles of the georgiglashow model in appendix b. the
requirement of nite action implies that a must approach asymptotically, i.e. for

1this relation holds for bosonic elds , see the next section for the case of fermions.

solutions of the classical equations of motion correspond to local minima of the action

functional, so that in each homotopy class they saturate the bound in (4.5). as a
consequence they are determined by the condition

 =  f a
f a
 .

in the k=0 sector the minimum is reached on the trivial vacuum, a=0, while the
congurations minimizing s[a] for |k| 6= 0 are (anti) instantons. self-dual and anti
self-dual congurations are referred to as respectively instantons and anti-instantons.

in the k=1 sector and for a gauge group su(2) the explicit solution was found

in [85, 86] through the ansatz

a = i

where  is real scalar eld. substituting into the equations of motion one obtains

the general solution depends on 3 additional parameters corresponding to the free-

cally invariant under the four-dimensional conformal group, which partially overlaps
with global gauge transformations. in [93] it has been proved that the most general

one-instanton solution depends on 8 parameters, referred to as collective coordinates
or moduli, that in the following will be denoted by i. the moduli space, i.e. the
space parameterized by the coordinates i, will be indicated by m. the eld (4.8)
has a singularity at y=0, which can be removed by a correspondingly singular gauge

transformation, so that one can construct a solution with no singularities at any x

coordinates for the n-instanton solution is 8n  3 (with n > 1). there are 8 moduli
for each single instanton, but one must subtract 3 global rotations that are already

accounted for by the relative rotations. this result can be proved to hold in general,
even if the n instantons are not widely separated, [94].

4.1.2 semiclassical quantization

to perform a semiclassical quantization around an instanton conguration according
to (4.2) one needs the expansion of s[a] around a = a, obtained putting a =
a + q, where q denotes the quantum uctuation. a straightforward calculation
gives the gauge kinetic operator in the instanton background

m ab

(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a
 = (cid:18) 2s[a]

ab

aa

=(cid:2)d2(a) + d(a)d(a)  2f (cid:3) ab ,

where d(a) =  + i[a, . ] is the covariant derivative.

in the instanton background the faddeevpopov quantization must be suitably
modied, because the kinetic operator m possesses 8 new zero modes (in the case
of a su(2) gauge group under consideration) beyond those associated with gauge

symmetry. these new zero-modes correspond to the symmetries of the action s[a]
that are broken by the instanton conguration and are related to the 8 collective
coordinates i in the general solution (4.9). in fact since a is a solution for any i

aa(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a
z d4y(cid:18) 2s[a]

a
i

(y, ) = 0 ,

so that (4.2) is formally divergent. this divergence is completely analogous to those

introduced in the partition function of gauge theories by the functional integration
along the gauge orbits, that is dealt with by the faddeevpopov procedure. the

correct way of performing the quantization in the instanton background was discussed
in [95]. the general instanton conguration will be parameterized as



a

 (x, ) = a + i ,

where  denotes an arbitrary gauge transformation and  the set collective coordi-

nates, 8 in the case of su(2) and k[a]=1 and in general 4nk[a] in the k-instanton
sector for a su(n) gauge group. the basic idea is then to constrain `a la faddeev

where (x) is parameterized as (x) = eiha(x)ta and the scalar product in the argu-
ments of the -functions is

(f, g) =

2z d4x tr (f(x)g(x)) .

(4.12)

equation (4.11) denes the faddeevpopov determinant fp. some algebraic steps
allow write z in the form

di es[a]fp(a, ) 

z =z [da]z yi
(cid:0)tr(cid:2)t ad(a)(cid:0)a  a(cid:1) (x)(cid:3)(cid:1) (cid:18)(a  a,

a

)(cid:19) .

in this relation an innite constant, coming from the integration over the group
algebra, has been dropped, since in the following the above construction will be

employed in the computation of normalized vevs of operators. the faddeevpopov
determinant in the above expression can be computed much in the same way as in
the case of the ordinary of gauge theories.

to compute expectation values in the semiclassical approximation one only needs
fp(a, ) on the classical solution a. it can be shown that in this case fp can be
written as

fp(a, )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)a=a

4.1.3 bosonic zero-modes

to explicitly compute expectation values through equation (4.14) one needs to know
the zero-mode vectors a(i)
 , whose norms enter the integration measure. since the
kinetic operator is modied by the gauge-xing term the vectors a(i)

 are given by

a(i)
 (x) =

a
i

(x, ) + d(a)(i)(x) ,

for a suitable function (i)(x), such that

a(i)

to compute the zero-mode vectors it is convenient to refer to the singular instanton
solution. for the case of a su(2) gauge group, after rescaling a  1

g a, it reads

a(x, ) =

the generalization to larger gauge groups,

is rather
straightforward [96, 97]. first it can be shown [98], that the mapping of s3 into
a generic group g, which determines the topological classication of the instanton
solutions, can be continuously deformed to a mapping into su(2). hence the classi-
cation of classical solutions into homotopy classes holds in general. furthermore one

in particular to su(n),

can construct a solution in the case of a gauge group g by the embedding of a su(2)
instanton. in particular for g=su(n) one can consider a conguration

whereas the other generators are organized into 2(n  2) doublets and the remaining
are singlets. in conclusion, in addition to eight zero-modes of the su(2) instanton,
there are 4(n  2) additional zero-modes. the corresponding vectors take the form

4.2.1 semiclassical approximation

in the full interacting theory one is interested in computing expectation values of elds
o(x1, . . . , xn) that are composite operators made up from the elementary elds , 
and a. in the semiclassical approximation one considers uctuations, a = a +q,
around a classical solution a; for the fermionic part of the action it is sucient
to restrict oneself to sa[, ].
in the spirit of the semiclassical approximation, in
the computation of expectation values of operators depending on a as well as on
fermionic elds, the functional integration over the latter is performed rst and then
the result is substituted into (4.14). thus as a starting point one considers

ho[, ]ia =z [dd]esa[,]o[, ]

and evaluates this integral through a saddle point approximation.

according to the properties of berezin integration (see appendix a) the last in-

tegral yields a non-vanishing result only if all the integrations over the fermionic
variables are correctly saturated. expanding  and  into eigenfunctions of the

dirac operator

i /dl(r)f (n) = nf (n) ,

i /dr(r)g(n) = ng(n) ,

gives

(4.19)

this expression shows that the operator o must contain exactly the number of zero-
modes of the dirac operator that are present in the instanton background in order

to have a non-vanishing vev.

hence one must study the eigenvalue problem for the dirac operator in the instan-
ton background. the number, nl, of left-chirality zero-modes of the dirac operator
(i.e. the number of zero-modes of i /dl) and the number of right-chirality zero-modes
(i.e. the number of zero-modes of i /dr), nr, are related by an index theorem [99]

nl  nr = 2drk[a] .

(4.20)

moreover for congurations with self-dual (anti self-dual) eld strength one has nr=0
(nl=0). thus from (4.19) in the k-instanton sector it immediately follows that the
operator o must contain an excess of exactly 2kdr factors of  with respect to  to
yield a non-zero result.

for instance in the case of a theory containing two weyl fermions,  and , in

the fundamental representation of the gauge group su(2) the relation

nl = 2drk[a] ,

nr = 0

when f[a] = f[a]

(4.21)

gives one single zero-mode, f (0) for  and  in the k=1 sector, so that

where det denotes the product of the non-zero eigenvalues. the generalization of
this elementary example to more complicated cases is rather straightforward. in the
following sections computations of vevs of composite operators in n =4 supersym-
metric yangmills theory will be described. the n =4 theory contains four weyl
spinors in the adjoint representation. in the case of a su(2) gauge group equation
(4.21) with d3=2 yields sixteen zero-modes in the one-instanton sector.

4.2.2 fermionic zero-modes

the discussion of the previous subsection shows that in order to compute the in-
stanton contribution to expectation values of fermionic elds one needs to know the
zero-value eigenstates of the dirac operator. in particular their norms are necessary

to convert the integrations over the zero-modes into integrations over (grassmannian)
collective coordinates as in the case of the bosonic zero-modes. for a weyl spinor in

the fundamental representation of su(2) there is one single zero mode which satises
the equation

where d(f)

where s=1,2 is an index of the fundamental of su(2). the norm of this zero eigen-
function is

in the case of the adjoint representation the equation for the zero-modes becomes

instead of
explicitly solving equation (4.22) the zero eigenfunctions can be obtained acting with
the symmetries of the model 3 on the conguration

a = a ,

which trivially satises (4.22). more precisely the zero-modes are obtained acting by

the symmetries broken by the instanton background. two of the four zero-modes are
generated by a supersymmetry transformation

4.3 instanton calculus in sym theories

123

the extension of the analysis described here to the case of a su(n) gauge group,

in the k=1 sector, can be obtained without too much eort and is achieved by the
embedding of a su(2) instanton in the su(n) eld conguration, see [100]. the

generalization to multi-instanton sectors on the contrary is quite involved and has
been developed in [101, 102, 103, 104, 105].

4.3 instanton calculus in supersymmetric

gauge theories

the machinery of the previous sections allows to compute the instanton contribution
to the vacuum expectation value of composite operators in supersymmetric gauge
theories. the problem is reduced to the computation of the primed determinants

of the kinetic operators, i.e. the product of non-zero eigenvalues, and then to the
integration over the collective coordinates with the measure constructed in sections

4.1 and 4.2.

in non-supersymmetric theories the integration over the bosonic collective coordi-
nates is ir-divergent because of the singular behaviour at   0. in supersymmetric
gauge theories, on the contrary, in all the known cases the integration turns out to be
nite thanks to the balance of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom that controls

the -dependence. this exact balance produces another signicant simplication:
the product of non-zero eigenvalues of bosonic and fermionic kinetic operators ex-

actly cancels out. as a result in various models instanton calculus allows to obtain
nite and exact results (in the semiclassical approximation) for the vevs of composite
operators, see [87] for a review.

cancellation of determinants in supersymmetric theories.

supersymmetry implies relations among the eigenvalues of the kinetic operators for
scalars, vectors and spinors, that lead to an exact compensation in the ratio of de-

terminants that enters the expression of the expectation values in the semiclassical
approximation.

first notice that the chiral dirac operator i /dl(r) satises

(cid:12)(cid:12)det(cid:0)i /dl(r)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

= det(cid:2)(cid:0)i /dl(r)i /dr(r)(cid:1)(cid:3) = det(cid:0)i /d(r)(cid:1) det(2) ,

where i /d(r) = id(r) is the kinetic operator for a dirac spinor, so it is sucient

124

chapter 4. non-perturbative eects in n = 4 sym theory

to solve the eigenvalue problem for i /d(r). let n be the non zero solutions of the
eigenvalue problem for a scalar eld in the instanton background

d2(a)(n) = 2

n(n)

n 6= 0 .

the two eigenvalue problems to be solved are

i /d(a)(n) = n(n)

(cid:0)d2(a)  2f[a](cid:1) q(n)

 = 2

nq(n)


and one can prove the following relations

n = n



(n)(x) =(cid:18) (n)

(n) (cid:19) ,

with (n) = i
n

d(a)(n), (n) = (n) and

n = n



q(n)

 = (n) ,

where  and  are two constant weyl spinors.

the ratio of determinants that enters the expression for the vev of an operator in

the semiclassical approximation is

"det(m g.f.

det(cid:16)i /d(adj)

where a regularization `a la paulivillars has been introduced. now substituting the
eigenvalues found in the previous sections one can show that there is a an exact

cancellation between bosons and fermions, so that the contribution of the non-zero
modes is 1! the total contribution of the zero-modes is

nb 1

2 nf ,

(4.25)

where nb and nf are respectively the number of bosonic and fermionic zero-modes.
notice that in the case of n =4 super yangmills theory (4.25) reduces to 1, as is
expected, since the theory, being nite, cannot lead to a result depending on the
renormalization scale.

for the calculation of vevs of operators o there are two dierent situations to
if the operator o contains precisely the number of zero-modes to

be considered.

4.4 instanton calculations in n =4 sym theory

125

saturate the fermionic integrations in the instanton background, one must simply
substitute the fermionic elds in o with the zero-modes and perform the integration
over the collective coordinates. this is the case that will be discussed in section 4.6.
if instead the operator o does not contain a sucient number of fermionic insertions
to saturate the grassmannian integrals, then the correlator is zero at the lowest order
and one must consider in hoi the insertion of terms lowered from the action, until
the correct number of spinors is obtained. this case will be described in section 4.5

for the correlation function of four scalar elds.

4.4 instanton calculations in n =4 supersymmet-

ric yangmills theory

the formalism described in the preceding sections will now be applied to the compu-
tation of green functions of gauge invariant composite operators in n =4 supersym-
metric yangmills theory. in particular correlation functions of operators belonging
to the multiplet of currents, see equations (2.17) and (2.18), will be calculated to low-

est order in the one-instanton sector and with gauge group su(2) [89]. the extension
of the results presented here to the case of su(n) and to the k-instanton sector in

the large n limit was given in [90] and [91, 92] and will be briey reviewed in the
concluding section. the operators in the current multiplet that will be considered

play a central role in the correspondence with type iib superstring theory compact-
ied on ads5  s5. this issue will be discussed in chapter 5, where the instanton
calculations will be compared with d-instanton eects in the type iib superstring on
ads5  s5.

in [89] a closed form for the instanton contribution to a four-point function of
composite scalar operators, qij in the 20 of the su(4) r-symmetry group has been
given. in the next section the complete space-time dependence of this green func-

tion will be computed. as will be discussed it will prove useful to employ for this
calculation a description of the model in terms of n =2 multiplets. also, it will be
shown that when a limit of coincident points is considered, in order to study the
operator product expansion (ope), the function develops a logarithmic singularity.
analogous results have been found by various groups [106, 107, 108, 109]. in these

papers a similar behaviour was extracted without explicitly performing all the inte-
grations, on the contrary in the computation presented here the singular behaviour

is shown with no ambiguities after a complete evaluation of the integrals which yield

126

chapter 4. non-perturbative eects in n = 4 sym theory

the green function under consideration in the semiclassical approximation. a more

detailed analysis of this subject and related questions will be presented elsewhere
[110].

in section 4.6 the computation of correlation functions of sixteen fermionic cur-
rents a
 and of eight gaugino bilinears e ab will be reported. for these green func-
tions the integration over the collective coordinates will not be performed, neverthe-
less the unintegrated form presented here will be sucient for the comparison with

the results from type iib superstring theory discussed in the nal chapter.

4.5 a correlation function of four scalar supercur-

rents

the multiplet of superconformal currents of n =4 super yangmills theory has been
given in section 2.2 for the abelian case. the natural four-point function of super-
conformal currents to consider would be a correlator of four stress energy tensors.

however, due to its complicated tensorial structure even the free-eld expression for
this correlator is awkward to express compactly and it is much simpler to consider
correlations of four gauge-invariant composite scalar operators

qij = ij

i, j, k = 1, 2, . . . , 6 ,

(4.26)

belonging to the representation 20 of the su(4) r-symmetry group. as discussed
in chapter 2 qij is the lowest component of the composite twisted chiral current
supereld [111] w ij

(2)

(2) = tr(cid:18)w iw j 
w ij

ij

wkw k(cid:19) .

after calculating correlation functions of these components one can derive those of
any other component in the n = 4 supercurrent multiplet by making use of the
superconformal symmetry [111]. a way to explicitly do it may be to resort to analytic
superspace, recalling that

qij(x)  w ij

where  are the supercoordinates of analytic superspace [21]. therefore, by com-
puting correlators of qij(x) and substituting x   any of the other correlation

(2)()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0

,

4.5 instanton contribution to a four-point function

127

functions can in principle be obtained by expanding in the fermionic as well as in the

auxiliary bosonic coordinates of analytic superspace.

the correlation function that will be considered is therefore

hqi1j1(x1)qi2j2(x2)qi3j3(x3)qi4j4(x4)i .

(4.27)

the value of this correlation function in the free eld theory is determined from the

expression for the free two-point scalar green function which is

hia(x)jb(y)ifree =

1

(2)2

ijab

(x  y)2 .

(4.28)

hence, the free-eld expression for the correlation function that follows by wick

contractions is

where,

xij = xi  xj .

the rst term in this expression is simply the product of two two-point functions

and is known to be exact. the second term, which is the free-eld contribution to
the connected four-point function, certainly gets corrections from interactions.

as has been discussed in detail in the preceding sections, in n =4 yangmills
theory there are sixteen zero-modes in the one-instanton sector in the case at hand of

a su(2) gauge group. in the background of the one-instanton solution, (4.9), (4.10),
the correlation function

hqi1j1(x1)qi2j2(x2)qi3j3(x3)qi4j4(x4)ik=1

(4.30)

where the subscript k = 1 denotes the winding number of the background, is zero
at the lowest order, because it does not contain any fermionic insertion to saturate
the integrations over the grassmannian collective coordinates of the sixteen zero-

modes. however it is easy to check that the correlation function (4.30) soaks up
these sixteen gaugino zero-modes when the perturbative corrections to the standard

instanton conguration are considered. this can be seen either from the form of the

128

chapter 4. non-perturbative eects in n = 4 sym theory

supersymmetry transformations, see equation (2.6), or from the equation of motion
for the scalar elds i. the expression (4.10) is annihilated by the conserved super-
symmetry transformations (those associated with the parameter  
a in (2.6)), while
the transformations corresponding to supersymmetries associated with a
 are broken
and generate eight of the sixteen fermionic zero modes. the other eight zero-modes

are generated by superconformal transformations. as a consequence acting with the
broken supersymmetry and superconformal transformations on the scalar elds in

(4.30) produces a conguration which possesses the required sixteen zero-modes. to
obtain the rst non-vanishing contribution to (4.30) one must consider insertions of
terms lowered from the action until the correct number of fermionic elds is obtained.

the rst non vanishing correction comes from the insertion of a yukawa term for each
eld i (see the form (2.5) of the action)

where for simplicity of notation not all the indices have been indicated explicitly.

in order to evaluate this instanton contribution in the most convenient fashion it
will be convenient to use the n =2 supersymmetric description in which, as explained
in section (2.1), i decomposes into the complex n =2 singlet  with u(1) charge +2
and a neutral n =2 quaternion qt in the (2, 2)0 representation of su(2)v su(2)h
which resides in the n =2 hypermultiplet. the scalar component qab
cd of the n =4
current decomposes in the following way in terms of n =2 elds,

qs0 = qs
q(+) = 2

qs0 = qs
q() = 2

qst = qsqt  trace

the n =2 formalism is particularly suitable to perform the integrations over the

and observing that the relevant permutations correspond to permutations of x =
y u+u, y and z = y (1u+)(1u), that are generated by the two transformations:
a) u+  1/u, u  1/u+, y  y uu+, which is equivalent to the exchange of x
and y , leaving z xed (i.e. to the exchange of x1 and x4 or, equivalently, of x2 and

of x and z (or the exchange of x2 and x4 or, equivalently, of x1 and x3).

to compute the explicit dependence of gq4 on xp one must perform the six deriva-

unlike correlation functions of elementary elds that are infra-red problematic
and gauge-dependent, the above correlator is well dened at non-coincident points.
moreover it possesses the correct symmetry properties. this can be derived from
the symmetry of b(xpq) discussed above and the observation that the dierential
operator (4.49) is completely symmetric. of course the symmetry properties can be
checked directly on the nal expression for q(xpq). notice that the above form for
q(xpq) is valid only for x, y, z in the physical domain, i.e. in the region obtainable
for allowed choices of x2

pq, that is dened by the condition

 = (x, y, z) = x 2 + y 2 + z 2  2xy  2xz  2y z  0 .

134

chapter 4. non-perturbative eects in n = 4 sym theory

in this region single terms in the above expression are complex, but the complete
function is real. to describe the physical region it is convenient to rewrite q(xpq) in
terms of two independent cross ratios,

r =

extracting a factor 1

y 4 in q(xpq). then the physical domain corresponds to the region

(r, s) =

in the (r, s) plane. this is the region inside the parabola in gure 4.1

having obtained a closed form for gq4(xp) one can study the behaviour when
any two points are taken close to one another, xpq  0. for instance x12  0 corre-
sponds to r  0, s  1 simultaneously. in this limit b(xpq) develops a logarithmic
singularity.

the logarithmic divergence in the green function gq4 can be shown more clearly
considering the particular conguration in which the points xp, p = 1, 2, 3, 4, are
taken on a line. in this case the cross ratios r and s are not independent. assuming
x1 < x2 < x3 < x4 r and s are related by

r + s = 1 .

thus one can express the result in terms of a single variable  dened by

r = 2 ,

s = (1  )2 .

in this limit the above computed function q(xpq) reduces to 5

(4.52)

and it can be shown that q() has a logarithmic singularity as   0 or   1.

this peculiar behaviour has been observed by various authors in four-point func-
tions computed in the context of the ads/cft correspondence [106, 107, 108, 109],

but here it is derived from an exact eld theoretical computation and thus shown
with no ambiguities. notice that single terms in q(xpq) have pole-type singularities
in the limit x12  0, but in the sum the singularity is only logarithmic. note in
particular that the poles associated with operators of dimension lower or equal to
q2 in the ope are absent. moreover with non-vanishing y the only singularities in
b(xpq) correspond to the points (r = 0, s = 1) and (r = 1, s = 0) marked in gure
4.1. taking into account the pre-factor, x4
34, in the complete expression of gq4 one
nds that the limit in which two 2 operators are taken to coincide gives a vanishing
result, while a logarithmic singularity is actually present when 2 approaches 2.

12x4

the logarithms by themselves do not violate the superconformal symmetry of the
theory, that is manifest in the nal expression of the four-point function. in some

respect, logarithmic behaviours in four-point functions should not sound unexpected
in a superconformal theory, such as n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory, that
contains a large number of primary elds all of whose (protected) dimensions are

integer. the singularity may be due to the presence of an innite tower of stable
bps dyons that collapse to vanishing mass and size in the superconformal phase or

to a gas of instantons of small size from the euclidean viewpoint. this problem is
under active investigation [110].

5this expression has been obtained by yassen stanev starting from a dierent but equivalent

formula for q(xpq).

4.6 eight- and sixteen-point correlation functions

of current bilinears

in this section the one-instanton contribution to correlation functions of sixteen fer-
mionic bilinears a
 and of eight gaugino bilinears e ab in the current supermultiplet
will be calculated in the semiclassical approximation. the expressions obtained will

be reconsidered in the next chapter and a comparison will be made with d-instanton
eects in type iib superstring theory compactied on ads5  s5.

4.6.1 the correlation function of sixteen fermionic currents

as could have been anticipated, it is particularly simple to analyze the contribution

of the yangmills instanton to the correlation function of sixteen of the fermionic
superconformal current bilinears, a

f 



a(cid:1),

16yp=1

g 16(xp) = h

g2 ap

p (xp)ik=1 ,

(4.53)

since each factor of  in the product provides a single fermion zero mode it is nec-
essary to consider the product of sixteen currents in order to saturate the sixteen
grassmannian integrals. to leading order in g, g 16 does not receive contribution
from anti-instantons. the leading term in the one-instanton sector is simply obtained
by replacing each f  with the instanton prole f  (equation (4.10)) and each  a

with the corresponding zero mode, a

the integration over the fermion zero modes leads to a sixteen-index invariant ten-
sor, t16, of the product of the su(4) and lorentz groups. assembling the 16 fer-
mionic collective coordinates into a sixteen-dimensional spinor t16 would simply read
ta1a2...a16
= a1a2...a16, with ai = 1, 2 . . . 16. further integration over the instanton

moduli space would determine the dependence on the coordinates xp. however, for
the purpose of the comparison with the corresponding expression obtained in the
type iib string theory in ads5  s5, that will be discussed in the next chapter, it is
sucient to leave the expression in the unintegrated form (4.55).

4.6.2 the correlation function of eight gaugino bilinears

in a similar fashion it is easy to deduce the one-instanton contribution to other related
processes, such as the eight-point correlation function,

ge 8(xp) = hg2e a1b1(x1) . . . g2e a8b8(x8)ik=1 ,

(4.56)

which also saturates the sixteen fermionic zero-modes present in the su(2) one-
instanton background. to leading order in g, ge 8 does not receive contribution from
anti-instantons. the complete non-abelian expression for e ab was given in equation
(2.19) and reads

e ab = aaa

b + gfabc t(ab)+

ijk

iajbkc ,

(4.57)

but at leading order in the gauge coupling constant only the term proportional to
the gaugino bilinear is relevant. in the instanton background the gaugino bilinear is
given by

aa
(0) (0)a

b =

the integration over the fermion zero modes leads to an su(4) invariant contraction
of the sixteen-index tensor t16 dened after (4.55) and further integration over the
instanton moduli space would determine the exact dependence on the coordinates
xp. again the unintegrated expression (4.59) is sucient for comparison with the
d-instanton contribution to the corresponding ads5  s5 amplitude that will be
considered in the next chapter.

138

chapter 4. non-perturbative eects in n = 4 sym theory

4.7 generalization to arbitrary n and to any k

for large n

in the previous sections instanton calculus in n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory
with gauge group su(2) in the k=1 sector have been presented following [89]. these
results have been extended to the case of su(n) for generic n in [90] and to arbitrary

instanton number in the large n limit in [91, 92]. these extensions are of fundamental
importance for the re-interpretation of the results of this chapter in the context of the
ads/cft correspondence that will be discussed in chapter 5. in this section the main

steps of the extensions of [90, 91, 92] will be briey reviewed. the generalization to
n > 2 is rather straightforward, on the contrary instanton calculus in sectors k > 1

presents an enormous increase of computational complexity. the formalism for multi-
instanton calculations (adhm formalism) has been developed in [101, 102, 103, 104,

105] and a review of the application of these techniques to su(n) supersymmetric
gauge theories can be found in [113]. as has been explained in [91, 92] there are

remarkable simplications in the adhm formalism in the large n limit.

since for a gauge group su(n) there are 2n  n gaugino zero modes in the
one-instanton background it might appear from a supercial analysis that the 16-
correlation function should vanish for n > 2. however it has been argued in [89] and
then clearly shown in [90] that only the sixteen geometric (8 supersymmetric + 8

superconformal) zero-modes are actually relevant in the general case of su(n), since
all the remaining ones, a
i , are lifted by a four-fermion term that is generated
in the one-instanton action. the instanton action computed in [90] has the form

i , a

sinst =

82k
g2 + s4f ,

(4.60)

where s4f contains a quartic fermionic interaction built up with the 8(n  2) ad-
ditional fermionic collective coordinates. the exact form of s4f in the k=1 sector
is

s4f =

2

162g2 abcd"n2xi=1

a
i b

i#"n2xj=1

j# .

c
j d

(4.61)

s4f is supersymmetric and lifts all but the 16 geometric gaugino zero modes.

for deniteness in the following the attention will be focused mainly on the 16
correlator, that is studied in [90]. in the case of su(n) there are additional zero-
a in (4.54). however these are lifted by (4.61) and the
modes contributing to (0)

4.7 generalization to any n and to k > 1 for large n

139

lowest order contribution in the one-instanton background is still obtained by sub-
stituting (4.54) in each factor of . as a result the expression for the 16-correlator
reviewed above for the case n=2 is actually true for all n, apart from an overall

n-dependent factor

(4.63)

in computing the last integral it is convenient to perform a hubbard-stratonovich
transformation of the fermion bilinears and represent s4f as a gaussian integral
over auxiliary bosonic collective coordinates i
ab [90]. in conclusion one nds the
following overall n dependence [90]

gn
16(xp) 

n g 16(xp) ,

(4.64)

where g 16(xp) is the expression valid in the n=2 case. this factor of n will be

of relevance in the next chapter for the comparison with d-instanton eects in type
iib superstring theory.

the generalization to multi-instanton sectors in the large n limit, as derived in
[91], is much more involved and would require an extended discussion, so only the

basic ideas will be summarized here. a detailed report on the construction can be
found in [92]. the moduli space of a su(n) k-instanton conguration, known as

adhm moduli space, has a very complicated structure for generic n. in [91, 92] it
has been proved that in the large n limit it is dominated by k instantons living in k
mutually orthogonal su(2) subgroups of su(n). then a saddle point approximation
is used to show that the geometry is actually described by (ads5s5)k, where in each
factor ads5 is parameterized by the positions and sizes of the k instantons, (xi
0 , i),
i = 1, . . . , k, and s5 by the auxiliary bosonic coordinates, i
ab, introduced in the

140

chapter 4. non-perturbative eects in n = 4 sym theory

hubbardstratonovich transformation. moreover the integrations in the vicinity of

the large n saddle point generate an attractive potential which actually forces all
the k instantons to a single point reducing the moduli space to a single copy of
ads5  s5 [92]. finally the small uctuations about this reduced moduli space
describe the dimensional reduction of su(k) n =1 super yangmills from d=10 to
d=0+0, so that the k-instanton measure in the large n limit factorizes into the
product of the measure on ads5  s5 times the partition function zk for the su(k)
(0+0)-dimensional theory. in conclusion, after evaluating zk, see [114, 115, 116, 117],
one obtains for a n-point correlation function like those considered in this chapter an
expression of the form [92]

n (xp) = g8nk n 7
g(k)

2 e 82k

g2 xd|k

d2 fn(xp) ,

(4.65)

where the sum is over the divisors of k and the function fn(xp) is independent of k.

ads/scft correspondence

the remarkable proposal suggested by maldacena in [38] of a correspondence relating
type iib superstring theory in ads5s5 to n =4 super yangmills theory has led to a
great renewal of interest in the latter. according to the formalization of maldacenas

original idea given by gubser, klebanov and polyakov [118] and by witten [119]
n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory in the superconformal phase is dual to type
iib superstring theory in ads5  s5 in the sense that correlation functions of yang
mills gauge invariant composite operators can be derived from the computation of
amplitudes in the compactication of the type iib superstring on ads5  s5. the
precise interpretation of this duality will be discussed later.

more generally the main idea of [38] is that type iib superstring theory in
adsd+1  m, where m is a compact manifold with positive curvature, should be
equivalent to a (super) conformal eld theory living on the d-dimensional boundary
of adsd+1. in this respect the proposed correspondence is holographic in the sense
of [120, 121].

moreover in the case of superconformal eld theories with gauge group su(n)
maldacena has argued that the large n limit should be equivalent to the supergrav-
ity approximation to the ads compactication of the type iib superstring. this

consideration makes the proposed duality particularly intriguing because it has long
been believed that the large n behaviour should be crucial in the understanding of

the non-perturbative dynamics of non abelian gauge theories [122].

non trivial checks of the suggested correspondence have been obtained in the large

n limit, i.e. employing the supergravity approximation, both at the perturbative and

at the non-perturbative level. however very little has been said about the extension

supporting the validity of the correspondence for nite n as well.

spondence has also allowed to point out peculiar behaviours in green functions of the

(super) conformal eld theories under consideration at short distances. four-point
functions develop logarithmic singularities in the limit of coincident points. this kind

of behaviour has already been shown in the instanton contribution to a four-point
function in n =4 super yangmills theory in section 4.5. analogous results have
been observed by various authors in green functions computed from supergravity
amplitudes in ads5  s5.

most of the work on the ads/cft correspondence has concentrated on the case
of ads5  s5 which is related to n =4 super yangmills. however considering the
compactication of the type iib superstring on adsd+1m9d, with m9d a dierent
compact manifold, one can study superconformal eld theories with less supersym-
metry. this is a very interesting subject for future developments. in particular the
possibility of generalizing the results to non-supersymmetric theories would be of

great relevance.

some recent reviews on the subject can be found in [123].

the chapter is organized as follows. in section 5.1 a very brief introduction to type

iib superstring theory and to its low energy supergravity limit is given. the concept
of d-branes, that has played a crucial role in maldacenas construction, is recalled in
section 5.2. the original conjecture of [38] together with the successive formalizations

are reviewed in section 5.3. the results by various authors in the computation of two-
and three-point functions are reported in section 5.4, while section 5.5 contains a

discussion on four-point functions. the remaining sections report on original results
in the comparison between instanton eects in n =4 super yangmills theory and
d-instanton contributions to amplitudes in type iib superstring theory, following
[89].

5.1 type iib superstring theory: a birds eye view

after their introduction in the late sixties in the context of dual models for the

description of hadronic processes, string theories have emerged as a prime (and up

5.1 type iib superstring theory

143

to now unique) consistent candidate for a unied theory of fundamental interactions

including gravity.

a form of the action describing the motion of a string in d-dimensional minkowski

space-time that is suitable for quantization has been proposed in [124, 125]

sp =

1

4z

dd abax bx ,

(5.1)

where x  = x (,  ) are the coordinates of the string which give the embedding of
the two-dimensional surface spanned by the string (worldsheet) into the d-dimensional
space-time (target space),  is a parameter with dimension (mass)2, related to the
string tension t by t = 1

2 , and ab is the two-dimensional metric.

roughly speaking the quantization of the bosonic string is achieved by expanding
in normal modes the solution of the classical equations of motion which follow from

(5.1) and interpreting the coecients of the expansion as creation and annihilation
operators. for open strings this gives rise to a spectrum made of a tachyon with mass
m2 =  1
 and a massless vector plus an innite tower of massive states, with masses
proportional to 1 . for closed strings one obtains, beyond the tachyon and a tower
of massive states, a rank two tensor, which decomposes into a symmetric traceless
tensor, an antisymmetric tensor and a scalar.

the presence of tachyons in the spectrum of bosonic string theories is very prob-
lematic. an interesting extension is represented by superstring theories, in which
worldsheet supersymmetry is obtained by supplementing the bosonic elds x (,  )
with their superpartners, (,  ), that are two dimensional majorana spinors and
space-time vectors. superstring theories are consistently formulated in ten space-time
dimensions and, as will be briey discussed, possess a spectrum of states including a
nite set of massless states plus an innite tower of massive states, but no tachyons.

the observation that two-dimensional gravity is conformally invariant at the clas-

sical level is the key point that allows to exploit the powerful tools of conformal eld
theory to describe the dynamics of the string. this is achieved by mapping the string
worldsheet to the complex plane through (,  )  z = e +i and introducing bosonic
and fermionic coordinates for the string as functions of z and z. the quantization
is then performed employing a brs formalism to identify the physical states in the

hilbert space generated by vertex operators. however since the aim of this section
is to briey review the basic ingredients of superstring theories (particularly the type

iib superstring) the more intuitive formalism of oscillators will be used.

the supersymmetric generalization of (5.1) is

ab(cid:1) +

where a are worldsheet dirac matrices. a is a raritaschwinger eld, the worldsheet
gravitino (superpartner of ab), which is a space-time scalar. exploiting worldsheet
superconformal symmetry one can put the action in the form

s =

1

4z d2 [+x x  il  +l  ir  r] ,

(5.2)

where + and  indices refer to light-cone coordinates,  =   . the equations of
motion coming from (5.2) lead to an expansion of x  and  in terms of independent
left- and right-moving oscillation modes for closed strings. for open strings imposing

neumann (free) boundary conditions makes left- and right-moving degrees equivalent,
so that roughly speaking the open string has half the degrees of freedom of a closed

string.

the coordinate  is taken in the range [0, 2] and is periodic; for the elds l,r
there are two consistent boundary conditions, either periodic, giving rise to the so
called ramond sector (r), or antiperiodic, corresponding to the neveuschwarz sector

(ns).

the solution of the equations of motion can be written schematically in the form

x 

l = xn
l = xn




nein( +)

nein( +)

(5.3)

(5.4)

and analogously for the right-moving part. the sum in (5.3) is over integer n, while
for the fermions in (5.4) n takes integer or semi-integer values in the r and ns
sectors respectively. the zero-modes in the expansion of x 
l,r correspond to the
momentum of the center of mass of the string, pl = pr = p . for the fermions there
are only zero-modes in the r sector that satisfy a cliord algebra. the ground state

of the quantum theory is constructed acting with the creation operators associated
with the zero-modes on the trivial vacuum. it is a so(9,1) spinor in the r sector and

a (tachyonic) scalar in the ns sector. a generic state in the spectrum of the string
is of the form

l1
n1 . . . lk

nk . . .|pl, ai  r1

m1 . . . rh

mh . . .|pr, bi ,

5.1 type iib superstring theory

145

where conventionally the negative modes are taken as creation operators and a and

b refer to the choice of the spin ground state in the r sector. the states are built
considering separately the ns and r sectors for left- and right-moving degrees of

freedom and then combining them. for the left-movers for instance this construction
leads to a tachyonic ground state in the ns sector, while the rst higher mass state is

a massless vector. in the r sector the ground state corresponds to massless fermions.
the correct way of dealing with tachyons was worked out in [36], where a prescrip-

tion, known as gso projection, was given which leads to space-time supersymmetric
string theories, containing no tachyonic state. in the ns sector the gso projection
eliminates the tachyon and leaves with a massless vector, while in the r sector it

produces a spinor with denite chirality. denoting, after the gso projection, by v
the ns ground state and with s and s the spinors with opposite chirality of the r
sector one has the following possibilities. if the gso projections on l and r mov-
ing degrees of freedom are dierent one gets the type iia superstring theory, which
has space-time supersymmetry n =(1,1) and is non chiral, whereas using the same
projection on the l and r parts gives the type iib string theory, which has n =(2,0)
in particular for the type iib theory, on which the
supersymmetry and is chiral.
attention will be focused in the following, the massless bosonic degrees of freedom
are obtained combining

or

ns  ns  v  v

r  r  s  s ,

and correspond to the following eld content

ns  ns  (g, b, )

r  r  (cid:0) = c (0), b, c (4)(cid:1) ,

where g is a rank two symmetric traceless tensor (the graviton), b and b
antisymmetric tensors,  a scalar (the dilaton),  a pseudoscalar (the axion), and
c (4) a four-form with self-dual eld strength, f (5) = dc (4) = (f )(5). from the
mixed sectors (r  ns and ns  r) one obtains the fermionic superpartners of the
previous elds.

the low energy eective description of type iib superstring theory, constructed in

terms of the above elds, is type iib supergravity in ten dimensions, which has chiral

146

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

n =(2,0) supersymmetry. there are subtleties in writing down a covariant action for
the model because of the self duality constraint on the four form eld strength. the
covariant equations of motion of the theory have been derived in [126]. combining
the ns  ns scalar and the r  r pseudoscalar into a complex eld  ,

 = 1 + i2 =  + ie ,

(5.5)

and denoting by h1 and h2 the eld strengths of the ns  ns and r r two forms,
the low energy action of type iib supergravity can be written, in the einstein frame,

in the form

(5.6)

where 0 is the ten-dimensional newton constant (0  ()2). in (5.6) the dots stand
for higher derivative terms and the fermionic elds have not been displayed. here
and in the following capital greek letters refer to at ten-dimensional space-time. in
is schematic, since a covariant kinetic term for the r  r
4-form cannot be written down naively because of the self-duality constraint. the
correct way to deal with this problem was described in [127]. the classical action is

(5.6) the notation(cid:0)f (5)(cid:1)2

invariant under sl(2,r) transformations that act projectively on the complex scalar
 . under the sl(2,r) group the ns  ns and r  r antisymmetric tensors form
a doublet. the scalar  parameterizes the coset space sl(2,r)/u(1)b, where the
u(1)b is an anomalous r-symmetry acting on the fermions. in particular the left
chirality gravitino carries charge + 1
2 under this symmetry and the right-chirality
dilatino present in the type iib spectrum has charge + 3
2. at the quantum level the
continuous sl(2,r) symmetry is expected to be broken to sl(2,z) [128].

for the calculations presented in the following the only relevant terms in the
eective action are those involving only derivatives of the metric apart from some

overall function of the complex scalar. for future purposes it is useful to write these
terms in the string frame that is related to the einstein frame by a weyl rescaling

 = e/2 g(e)
g(s)
 .

the leading terms in the derivative expansion that will be considered take the form

[114]

()4z d10xg(cid:2)e2r + ()3f4(,  )e/2r4(cid:3) .

(5.7)

5.2 d-branes

147

where  is a numerical constant. the riemann curvature enters the r4 factor in a
manner that may be most compactly described by writing it as an integral over a
sixteen-component grassmann spinor,

r4 z d16(r4)4 ,

where

r4 = 12 34

 r1234 ,

which only includes the weyl tensor piece of the riemann tensor. here, 123
are the totally antisymmetric products of three ten-dimensional -matrices and the
grassmann parameter a (a = 1, . . . , 16) is a chiral spinor of the ten-dimensional
theory. this expresses r4 as an integral over half of the on-shell type iib superspace.
beyond these terms there is a sixteen-dilatino term in the eective action that
is related to the r4 term by supersymmetry and will play a central role in the
comparison with the results of instanton calculus presented in the previous chapter.
the sixteen fermion interaction reads [129, 130]

()1z d10xg e/2f16(,  )16 + c.c. ,

(5.8)

where the complex chiral dilatino has been denoted by  and the interaction is
(totally) antisymmetric in the sixteen spinor indices. the properties of the modular
functions f4(,  ) and f16(,  ) in equations (5.7) and (5.8) will be discussed later.
they receive both perturbative corrections and non-perturbative contributions from
d-instantons [114]. the latter will be related to instanton eects in n =4 super
yangmills theory.

5.2 d-branes

the perturbative spectrum of type ii (a and b) superstring theories does not contain
states charged with respect to the elds in the r  r sector [131]. however the
urry of work on string dualities during the last years has lead to a much deeper
understanding of non-perturbative aspects of string theories, changing dramatically

the scenario which was established at the perturbative level.

from a low energy viewpoint the existence of solitonic solutions of the super-

gravity equations of motion has been known for a long time [132]. these solitonic

148

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

congurations describe extended objects, p-branes, that are naturally coupled to the
r  r forms and their duals. the role of these non perturbative states in the fun-
damental string theory has been claried by polchinski [133] through the concept of

d-branes.

a p-brane is p-dimensional object, whose world-volume is p + 1-dimensional. it

naturally couples to a (p + 1)-form, c (p+1), through an action of the form

zvp+1

c (p+1) ,

where vp+1 is the world-volume of the brane. in d space-time dimensions the corre-
sponding electric charge would be

qe =zsdp2



dc (p+1) .

the magnetic dual of a p-brane is a (dp4)-brane, which couples to a (dp3)-form
and carries magnetic charge

qm =zsp+2



dc (p+1) .

in particular in the case of the type iib theory in the r  r sector there is a
scalar, the axion , i.e. a zero-form c (0)  , a rank two anti-symmetric tensor,
b, i.e. a two-form c (2) and a four form c (4). coupled to c (0) one has a (-1)-brane
which is an object localized in space-time, i.e. an instanton in euclidean space-time.
eects of d-instantons in type iib superstring theory will be discussed later. the

two-form couples to a one-dimensional object, a d-string that should not be confused
with the fundamental string which couples to the ns  ns two-form. finally there
is a 3-brane charged with respect to the four-form c (4). moreover one can consider
the corresponding magnetically dual objects.

starting from the type ii supergravity action, extremal (i.e. saturating a bps

bound) solitonic congurations with the previously discussed properties can be con-
structed assuming that only the metric g, the dilaton  and a p + 1 form are
non-vanishing. the ansatz that one considers for these elds is

ds2 = e2a(r)d~x2 + e2b(r)d~y2

 = (r)

c (p+1)
01...p = ec(r) ,

5.2 d-branes

149

where the ten-dimensional coordinates x  are split into longitudinal (x,  = 0, 1, . . . , p)
and transverse (yi, i = p + 1, . . . , 9) coordinates and r2 = yiyi. the solution of the
supergravity equations can be written in terms of a single harmonic function hp(r),
i.e. a solution of the laplace equation in the 9  p transverse dimensions,

hp(r) = 1 +

ap
r7p ,

where ap is a constant with dimension l7p, related to the charge carried by the
p-brane. the p-brane solution is (in the einstein frame)

ds2 = [hp(r)]

8 d~x2 + [hp(r)]

e2(r) = [hp(r)]

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

notice in particular that in the case of a 3-brane the dilaton  reduces to a constant.
the solution simplies in the string frame where the metric becomes

ds2 = [hp(r)] 1

2 d~x2 + [hp(r)]

2 d~y2 .

it can be proved that these solitonic solutions are bps saturated and preserve

one half of the supersymmetries of the original at background, i.e. 16 supercharges
out of 32. this implies for instance that there exist a relation between the mass and

charge of the solitons.

many of the recent developments in string theory have been made possible by the
suggestion [133] of a way to incorporate the above solitonic objects into type ii string

theories, see [134] for a review.

the solitonic p-branes are introduced in the microscopic string theory in relation

with a (dirichlet) open string subsector. more precisely one introduces dirichlet
p-branes (or dp-branes) as p-dimensional hyperplanes where open strings can end,

satisfying neumann (standard) boundary conditions on the p longitudinal coordinates
x ,  = 0, . . . , p  1 and dirichlet (xed) conditions on the remaining transverse
coordinates x m, m = p, . . . , 9. d-branes dened in this way can be seen as topolog-
ical defects where open strings can end. these hyperplanes are actually dynamical
objects, whose elementary excitations are described by the open strings attached

to them. these open strings can be consistently introduced in type ii superstring
theories, without considering standard open strings propagating independently in

the target space. there are various arguments that lead to identify d-branes with

150

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

the solitonic p-branes of type ii supergravities. for instance considering two parallel

d-branes their interaction is mediated by the exchange of closed strings and one can
prove that this results in a vanishing total force just like for example is found for a

monopole pair. furthermore it can be shown that the boundary conditions imposed
on the open strings ending on the d-brane break half the supersymmetries, so that

the d-branes are bps saturated objects.

the dynamics of d-branes, in a microscopic string theory perspective, is described

by the open strings attached to the brane. comparing the eective world-volume
dynamics of the d-brane with the dynamics of solitonic p-brane solutions in the
moduli space approximation one can nd further evidence for the identication of

the two.

the massless spectrum of the subsector of open strings attached to a p d-brane

is a maximally supersymmetric u(1) gauge theory in p + 1 dimensions. the eec-
tive world-volume degrees of freedom of a p d-brane correspond to the dimensional
reduction of a n =1 vector multiplet from d=10 to d = p + 1. this gives rise to a
supersymmetric maxwell theory (with sixteen supercharges) including 9  p scalars,
one vector and their superpartners.

considering n d-branes one can have also open strings stretched between them.
they describe the exchange of massive vector states. there are n 2 ways of stretching
the strings among the branes. in the limit in which the n d-branes are taken to
coincide these n 2 dierent states become massless. the symmetry is enhanced to
u(n) and one is left with an eective u(n) yangmills theory in which the n 2 vectors
form the adjoint. in general the relative separations among the branes determine the
expectation values of the 9  p scalars in the eective theory.

in particular in the case of a collection of n coincident d3-branes the world-
volume eective action is a u(n) supersymmetric yangmills theory with sixteen
supercharges in d=4, i.e. the n =4 super yangmills theory with gauge group u(n) 1.

1actually there is a u(1) factor that describes the center of mass motion and decouples, so that

the gauge group is su(n ) [135].

5.3 the ads/scft correspondence conjecture

in the case of d3-branes the solution for the metric yields (in the string frame)

(5.12)

where (x, yi) are the previously introduced cartesian coordinates and l is a length
scale. as already noticed in the case of a d3-brane the dilaton is constant,  = 0,
and determines the string coupling constant

gs = e0 .

considering a d3-brane conguration with n units of r  r 5-form eld strength,
i.e. a conguration of n coincident d3-branes, the length l is

l4 = 4gsn2 .

(5.13)

the key observation which led maldacena to the formulation of the ads/cft corre-
spondence conjecture [38] is that the metric (5.12), in the near horizon limit r  0,
reduces to

ds2 =

l2

2 (cid:0)dx  dx + d2(cid:1) + d2

5 ,

(5.14)

r2 and d2

where 2 = l4
5 is the spherically symmetric constant curvature metric on
a 5-sphere, which is the metric of the ads5  s5 space.
in (5.14) l is the radius
of curvature of both the 5-sphere and the ads factor. the d3-brane metric can be

viewed as a solitonic conguration interpolating between two maximally supersym-
metric backgrounds, the near horizon ads5  s5 and at ten dimensional minkowski
space-time at innity.

maldacena has argued, on the basis of previous results in the context of the
description of black holes by d-branes [136], that the region that should be identied
with the yangmills low energy description is the throat, i.e. the region r 
l, in the d3-brane metric (5.12). see [137] for related work. this leads to the
conjecture that n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory should be dual to type iib
superstring theory compactied on ads5  s5. the original conjecture relates type
iib supergravity to su(n) n =4 super yangmills in the large n limit. this is
related to the fact that the limit gs  1 at large length scale with respect to the

152

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

string scale, 
l2  1, in which one can trust the supergravity approximation, requires
n   with 4gsn xed and large. the correspondence relates the complexied
yangmills coupling constant to the one of the type iib superstring in ads5  s5 by

gs =

0 =

,

where 0 is the constant r  r scalar and from now on the yangmills coupling
constant and vacuum-angle will be denoted respectively by gym and ym.

this implies that the large n limit of relevance here coincides with the large n
limit considered by t hooft in [122], with the eective coupling g = gymn 2 xed at
a large value.

the ads5 space has constant negative curvature and possesses a boundary that
is the four dimensional minkowski space 2. according to maldacenas proposal, the
boundary of ads5, which corresponds to   0, i.e. r   in the notation of (5.14),
is exactly the location of the n =4 theory and the boundary values of the bulk
supergravity elds act as sources that couple to gauge-invariant composite operators
in n =4 super yangmills theory. the correct interpretation of this statement has
been explained in [118, 119] and will be discussed soon.

the ads5  s5 background is characterized by the non-vanishing elds,

where upper case latin indices, m, n,   = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, span the ads5 coordinates
and lower case latin indices, m, n,   = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 span the s5 coordinates. the
only non-vanishing components of the ricci tensor are

(5.16)

upon contracting (5.16) with the metric tensor it follows that the total (5+5)-

vanishes as well in ads5  s5 because of the conformal atness of the metric.

this background is maximally supersymmetric (just like the minkowski vacuum)

so there are 32 conserved supercharges, that transform as a complex chiral spinor of
the tangent-space group, so(4,1)so(5). in the basis where the ten dimensional 
matrices are given by m = 1  m  1i and m = 2  1i m, the supersymmetries
are generated by the killing spinors that satisfy

d 

1
2l

(1  1i  1i) = 0 ,

(5.17)

which follows from the requirement that the gravitino supersymmetry transformation

should vanish. in this basis the complex chiral supersymmetry parameters read

 =(cid:18) 1

0 (cid:19)     ,

where  are complex four-component so(4,1) spinors and  complex four-component
so(5) spinors, satisfying

strong support to the conjecture comes from symmetry considerations. ads5
has a so(2,4) isometry group which is to be identied with the four-dimensional
conformal group in the boundary theory. the isometry group of the s5 factor is
so(6)su(4) and is related to the su(4) r-symmetry group of the n =4 yangmills
theory. including the associated fermionic generators the super-isometry group of the
type iib background (5.14) is exactly the superconformal group su(2,2|4) of n =4
super yangmills in four dimensions. moreover the sl(2,z) s-duality group that
is conjectured to be preserved in the type iib superstring at the quantum level is
identied with the (conjectured) exact s-duality symmetry group of four dimensional
su(n) n =4 yangmills theory. the former is connected to the existence of an
innite set of stable dyonic bps string solitons [128], the latter to the existence an

innite set of stable dyonic bps states [72], as discussed in chapter 2.

the spectrum of excitations of the maximally supersymmetric compactication of
the type iib superstring on the ads5  s5 background, rst considered in [126], was
studied in great detail in [138, 139]. the map that associates elds in the multiplet
of type iib supergravity to the corresponding operators in n =4 super yangmills

154

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

has been worked out in [140, 141, 142]. states in the spectrum of d=5 n =8 gauged
supergravity admit a natural classication in terms of spherical harmonics on the
5-sphere. in the conjectured correspondence the lowest lying states, assembled into
the n =8 gauged supergravity multiplet, couple to the supermultiplet of super yang
mills currents, equations (2.17) and (2.18), that are bilinear in the elementary

yangmills elds. higher  spherical harmonics, i.e. kaluzaklein (kk) descendants
of the supergravity elds, couple to other chiral primary elds, that correspond to

th-order gauge-invariant polynomials in the elementary super yangmills elds.
moreover, stable string excitations that couple to non-chiral primary elds are needed
for the closure of the operator algebra [143]. despite some interesting progress [144],
a useful worldsheet description for the type iib superstring in ads5  s5 is still
lacking. nevertheless the stringy truncation of the kk spectrum to   n seems to
be a robust result that matches with the naive expectations on the super yangmills
side.

the explicit connection between the bulk theory and the boundary theory has
been given a precise formulation in [118, 119]. the partition function of the type iib

superstring, computed with suitable boundary conditions on the four-dimensional
boundary of ads5, plays the role of generating functional for connected green func-
tions of gauge-invariant composite operators in n =4 yangmills theory. more pre-
cisely one identies

ziib[j] =z [da] exp(sym[a] + o[a]j) ,

(5.18)

where ziib[j] is the partition function of the type iib superstring, evaluated in terms
of the bulk string elds, which is computed with prescribed boundary values j for
the elds. elementary elds of the n =4 super yangmills theory on the boundary
are denoted by a and o(a) are gauge-invariant composite operators to which j(x)s
couple.

the left hand side of (5.18) is computed performing the functional integration
over the bulk elds (z; ), where  are the coordinates on s5 and zm  (x, )
(m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and  = 0, 1, 2, 3) the coordinates on ads5 (  z5 is the coordinate
transverse to the boundary)

ziib[j] =z [d]j exp(siib[]) .

(5.19)

in (5.19) the notation (z; ) refers collectively to the massless supergravity elds,

5.3 ads/scft correspondence

155

their kaluzaklein descendents, and possibly the string excitations. the functional

integral depends on the boundary values, j(x), of the bulk elds.

the exact map which associates elds in the type iib compactication with op-
erators in n =4 super yangmills theory is dictated by the matching of quantum
numbers corresponding to the previously discussed global symmetries. furthermore
the conformal dimension, , of a yangmills operator o is related to the ads mass
m of the corresponding supergravity eld. for instance in the case of scalar operators

the relation is

(ml)2 = (  4) ,

(5.20)

where only the positive branch of  = 2 p4 + (ml)2 is relevant for the lowest-

mass supergravity multiplet.

as already remarked in the kaluzaklein reduction of type iib supergravity on s5
the states are classied expanding the ten-dimensional elds in spherical harmonics

on the 5-sphere. this procedure generates an innite tower of states with spins up to
2. the masses of the states associated with single modes and their behaviour under
the so(2,4) isometry group of ads5 are determined by solving the corresponding
linearized equations of motion [139].

alternatively the kaluzaklein excitations of all the elds in the type iib gauged
supergravity can be constructed, using the killing spinors dened in equation (5.17),
from the modes of the massless singlet dilaton e. the construction is rather involved
and will be briey sketched only for elds that will be relevant in the following.

one obtains a classication of the states according to the representations of the
isometry group of ads5  s5, which adding the associated fermionic generators be-
comes su(2,2|4). in particular the mass of the states is identied with the eigenvalue
of one of the generators of so(2,4). this allows to construct a map which relates each
eld in the supergravity multiplet to the corresponding composite operator in n =4
super yangmills theory by matching the su(2,2|4) quantum numbers (recall that
on the super yangmills side su(2,2|4) is the n =4 superconformal group). notice
that since the states in the supergravity multiplet as well as their kk descendants
have spins not larger than 2, they belong to short multiplets of su(2,2|4).

the massless dilaton is associated with the constant mode on s5, i.e. with the
scalar spherical harmonic y() with  = 0. also at the  = 0 level there is the
ve-dimensional graviton, describing the excitations of the ads5 metric. the other
scalars in the supermultiplet are associated with excitations on the 5-sphere, i.e. they

156

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

have  > 0. in particular there are real scalars qij with mass m2 =  4
l2 in the 20r
of the so(6) isometry group of s5. they result from a combination of the trace of
the internal metric and the self-dual r  r ve-form eld, f (5), with  = 2 (qij are
quadrupole moments of s5). the trace part of the metric uctuations can be written
in the form

gm n =

16
15

f m n

gmn = f mn ,

where f = f (z, ). analogously for the r  r 4-form one gets

am n p q = 

l
4

m n p qrrf

amnpq = 

l
4

mnpqrrf .

the relation with the scalar elds qij(z) is of the form

f (z, ) = qij(z)y ij

=2() .

similarly the complex scalars eab with mass m2 =  3
l2 and their conjugates are
associated with the pure two-form uctuations with  = 1 of the complexied anti-
symmetric tensor, constructed from the r  r and ns  ns two-forms, in the
internal directions. the massless vectors v [ij]
m in the 15, that gauge the so(6) isome-
try group, are in one-to-one correspondence with the killing vectors of s5 and result
from a linear combination with  = 1 of the mixed components of the metric and
the internal three-form components of the r  r four-form potential, c (4). the 6
complex antisymmetric tensors b[ab]
l2 , that have peculiar rst order
equations of motion, result from scalar spherical harmonics with  = 1. the analysis
of the fermions is similar. the dilatini a in the 4 of so(6) are proportional to the
internal killing spinors + and have mass m =  3
2l . they play a central role in the
comparison between the eects of instantons in n =4 yangmills and d-instantons in
type iib string theory that has been carried out in [89] and will be reviewed in section
5.6. the 20c spinors a
2l correspond to internal components
of the gravitino with  = 1. finally the supergravity multiplet is completed by the
massless 4 gravitinos m a which are proportional to the internal killing spinors .
the above elds are the ones that act as sources for the superconformal cur-
rents (2.17), (2.18). more precisely the graviton and dilaton are associated with the
su(4) singlets in the n =4 current multiplet, the stress-energy tensor t and the
scalar c respectively. the other scalars, eab and qij, correspond to e ab and qij
in (2.18) respectively. the massless vectors v [ij]
m are dual to the su(4) currents j a

to the supersymmetry currents a.

 . the identication can be carried out
bc are associated
bc in (2.18). the gravitinos m a correspond

m n to bab

higher kaluzaklein modes correspond to higher values of . for example, there

are other scalar modes with  > 2. each of these can be put in one-to-one correspon-
dence with a gauge singlet composite operator w() that starts with

w (i1...i)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0 = tr(cid:0)(i1 . . . i)(cid:1)  traces ,

(5.21)

which has dimension  =  and belongs to the -fold symmetric traceless tensor
representation of so(6) with dynkin labels (0, , 0). the multiplet contains 2562(2
1)/12 states with dierent  and su(4) quantum numbers.

the correct recipe for calculating correlations follows from (5.18) and amounts to
computing the truncated green functions in the bulk and attaching bulk-to-boundary
propagators to the external legs [118, 119, 145]. the precise forms of the latter depend

on the spin and mass of the eld. for instance, the bulk-to-boundary green function
for a bulk scalar eld m associated to a dimension  operator o on the boundary
reads

k(x, ; x, 0) = c



(2 + (x  x)2) ,

(5.22)

where c is a constant given by c = ()/[2(  2)]. for simplicity the 
dependence has been suppressed, so that the expression (5.22) is appropriate for an

s-wave process in which there are no excitations in the directions of the ve-sphere,
s5. in terms of k the bulk eld

m(z; j) =z d4xk(x, ; x, 0)j(x)

(5.23)

satises the boundary condition m(x, ; j)  4j(x) as   0, since 4k
reduces to a -function on the boundary. as observed in [145] the bulk-to-boundary

propagator must be modied for =2.
in this case the previous expression van-
ishes since c=0 for =2. in the special case =2 one must require m(x, ; j) 
2 log  j(x), which yields c=2 = (2)
22 . before discussing specic calculations, that
will be related to instanton eects in n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory, this
prescription for evaluating green functions will be illustrated in more detail in the

case of two- and three-point functions in the next section.

158

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

the generalization of this construction to fermionic elds has been considered

in [146] and will be relevant later when the calculation of a correlation function of
sixteen fermionic dilatini will be presented.

the original conjecture involves the supergravity approximation and holds in the

large n limit. however in [38] it has been suggested that the correspondence can
be generalized to nite n by taking in account string theory corrections. this claim

has been made more explicit in [119]. for nite n the role of generating functional
is played by the full partition function of the string in ads5  s5, computed with
suitable boundary conditions. moreover for nite n, i.e. for nite radius, one expects
a truncation to   n of the kaluzaklein spectrum, that should result by taking
into account full-edged stringy geometry as in any string compactications.

perturbative checks of the conjecture at nite n for two- and three-point functions

have been given in [147, 148] and will be discussed in the next section. the non-
perturbative computations of [89] suggest that the correspondence remain valid at

nite n also for four- or higher-point functions of some protected operators at least.

witten has also suggested an intuitive way to represent diagrammatically the

above described construction through graphs like those depicted in gure 5.1.

figure 5.1: wittens representation of three point functions in the ads/cft corre-
spondence.

the circles in gure 5.1 represents the four-dimensional boundary of ads5 and the
interior is the bulk. lines connecting an internal point with a point on the boundary
are the above discussed bulk-to-boundary propagators (see e.g. equation (5.22)). in
the supergravity approximation, i.e. in the limit of large n and large and xed g2
ymn,
only tree diagrams like the rst one in gure 5.1 contribute, while the loop-diagrams

become relevant for nite n, when string eects must be taken into account. this

5.3 ads/scft correspondence

159

can be understood as the loops correspond to closed string exchange which gives a

contribution that is suppressed in the large n limit.

attempts have also been made to generalize the correspondence to conformal
theories with less supersymmetry and hopefully to non-supersymmetric theories. this
is achieved by studying the compactication of the type iib superstring on ads5x5,
where x5 is a compact einstein manifold, i.e. a positively curved compact manifold
with metric satisfying r = g, with  > 0. the simplest examples are obtained
considering x5=s5/, where  is a discrete subgroup of so(6).
in this case x5
presents orbifold type singularities, but it has locally the geometry of s5. in [149, 150]
this models have been discussed in detail and it has been shown that taking n
coincident d3-branes placed at an orbifold singularity one can construct n =2 and
n =1 theories. such theories have product gauge groups su(n)k and contain matter
elds in the fundamental and adjoint representations.

a possible approach to the study of non conformal eld theories through the
ads correspondence has been suggested in [151]. the model proposed in [151] is

based on the observation that eld theories at nite temperature can be described
by near-extremal p-brane solutions. non supersymmetric theories are then obtained

by imposing anti-periodic boundary conditions for the fermions on the compactied
direction, corresponding to the raising of temperature, which explicitly break super-

symmetry. qualitative agreement with the expectations for qcd at strong coupling
has been found following this approach. in particular the results from supergravity

calculations include the area low behaviour of wilson loops, the presence of a mass
gap for glueball states, the relation between connement and dual superconductivity
and the existence of heavy quark baryonic states [151, 152]. numerical calculations of

glueball masses have been performed in [153] applying the same method. the results
appear to be in agreement with those obtained from lattice simulations. the limit

of this approach is that for the supergravity approximation to be reliable one must
take the eective t hooft coupling to be large, while the weak coupling region is the

one relevant for the continuum limit on the lattice. as a consequence to actually
compare the results from ads with lattice extrapolations to the continuum, it seems

to be necessary to extend the correspondence to nite n, which requires a full string
theory description in ads.

more recently the near-horizon geometry of a stack of d3-branes in type 0 the-
ories has been proposed as a candidate for a non supersymmetric version of the

above discussed correspondence. in these models the tachyon should . . . peacefully

160

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

condense in the bulk [154]. the basic idea suggested by polyakov in [154] is that

non-supersymmetric theories should have as their duals string theories displaying
worldsheet supersymmetry, but no space-time supersymmetry. this is the prop-

erty characterizing type 0a and 0b string theories, which have been introduced in
[155]. this theories are constructed by a non-chiral gso projection, which explicitly

breaks space-time supersymmetry and leads to a spectrum containing no space-time
fermions. the bosonic spectrum is the same as in the corresponding type ii theories
in the nsns sector and contains a doubled set of rr elds. the interest in these
theories has been renewed in the systematic construction of their open string descen-
dants [156]. the inclusion of d-branes in such theories has been studied in [156, 157]

and allows to construct non-supersymmetric gauge theories as world-volume theories,
which do not contain open string tachyons [156, 154, 158]. in particular in [158] a

su(n) yangmills theory coupled to six real massless scalars has been constructed as
world-volume theory of n coincident d3-branes in type 0b theory. in this model the

5-form eld strength is not constrained to be self dual and so one can consider both
electrically and magnetically charged d3-branes. moreover in the d3-brane solution

the dilaton is not constant, but acquires a spatial (radial) dependence as a conse-
quence of the presence of the ns  ns tachyon. in [158] it is argued that this radial
dependence may be related to a dependence of the coupling constant on the energy

scale in the gauge theory description. in [159, 160] a eld theory with asymptotically
free behaviour is constructed from a d3-brane type 0 background with ads5  s5
geometry.

this very interesting issues will not be further addressed here, in the following

the attention will be focused on the correspondence between type iib string theory
in ads5  s5 and n =4 super yangmills theory.

5.4 calculations of two- and three-point functions

in this section the prescription for the calculation of correlation functions will be
discussed in more detail. first the general idea in the simplest case of scalar elds

and for spinors will be reviewed considering two-point functions, then some general
considerations on the properties of correlators of r-current operators and some non-

renormalization theorems will be reported. finally the computation of two- and
three-point functions of generic chiral primary operators will be discussed.

the computation of two-point functions according to the prescription of the pre-

5.4 two- and three-point functions

161

vious section goes as follows. the euclidean action for a real massive scalar eld in
ads5 is

s =

1

2z d5z g(cid:2)gm n (m )(n ) + m22(cid:3) .

(5.24)

as has been explained in [118, 119] in order to compute the two-point green function
of an operator o[a], related by the correspondence to  and coupled to a source j in
the boundary theory, in the supergravity approximation valid for large n, one must

solve the equation of motion obtained from (5.24) with the condition that (x, )
approach j(x) as   0. the equation of motion is

1
g

m(cid:0)ggm n n (cid:1)  m2 = 0 .

then, after substituting into (5.24) the solution with the prescribed behaviour in the
limit   0, taking the functional derivatives with respect to j one obtains the green
function. the relevant solution is of the form of equation (5.23). as a result one gets
for the two-point functions

ho(x)o(y)i = z d4xd

5

(cid:2)m k(x, ; x, 0)2m k(x, ; y, 0)+
+m2k(x, ; x, 0)k(x, ; y, 0)(cid:3) .

then integration by parts and use of the equation of motion yields 3

ho(x)o(y)i =

( + 1)
2(  2)

1

(x  y)2 .

(5.25)

(5.26)

this computation of two point functions has led witten to establish the relation
(5.20) between the ads mass m of the eld  and the conformal dimension  of the
corresponding operator o. in [119] the same analysis has been carried out for massive
vector elds. in general for a p-form eld the relation between the ads mass and the
scaling dimension of the dual composite operator becomes (4+p)(p) = (ml)2,
which yields

 = 2 p4 + (ml)2 + p(p  4) .

the case of the graviton gm n , related to the stress-energy tensor, has been considered
in [118, 161].

3again this expression must be modied in the case =2, see the previous section.

162

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

repeating the above construction for a massive spinor in ads5 provides the bulk
to boundary propagator for fermionic elds [146]. one starts from the action for
massive spinors in ads5

m  m n(cid:19)  = (55 +    25) ,

m is the vielbein,  m n

m the spin connection (hatted indices refer to the
where e l
tangent space) and   are the four-dimensional dirac matrices. just like in the case
of scalar elds in order to compute correlation functions one must solve the equations
of motion with assigned boundary conditions. however the action (5.27) vanishes for

any eld conguration which satises the equations of motion. this implies that
the partition function is actually independent of the boundary condition on the eld

, so that it cannot be used as a generating functional. to solve this problem a
suitable modication of the action (5.27) by the addition of a boundary term has

been proposed in [146]. the uniqueness of such a boundary term has been recently
discussed in [162].

the suggestion of [146] is to supplement the action (5.27) by a term of the form

sb = lim

0zm 

d4xg ,

(5.29)

where m  is a closed four-dimensional submanifold of ads5, which approaches the
boundary of ads5 as   0. in (5.29) g is the metric on m  induced by the one
of ads5. this boundary term does not modify the equations of motion in the bulk
and furthermore is invariant under the isometry group of ads5. as a consequence
of the vanishing of the bulk action on eld congurations satisfying the equations of

motion the entire contribution to the partition function, to be employed as generating
functional in the ads/cft correspondence, comes from the boundary term (5.29).
(x, ; y, 0) for
spinors of mass m. for fermionic elds, as discussed in [146], the relation between
the ads mass of a supergravity eld and the scaling dimension, , becomes

 = 2  ml .

the case of the dilatino, , with ads mass m =  3

2l , corresponding to an operator

in the construction of [146] there is a subtlety related to the apparent arbitrariness

of the coecient of the boundary term (5.29) to be added to to the bulk action. this
point has been recently claried in [162]. in the derivation of the equations of motion

from a variational principle only the negative chirality part of the boundary limit of
the spinor  is xed. the variation of the positive chirality component of  on the

boundary generates the boundary term in the action, which is uniquely xed by the
requirement that the total variation of the action must be zero on the solution of the
equations of motion in the class of histories dened by the boundary conditions.

to compute three-point functions one must consider interaction terms in the su-
pergravity action and solve the corresponding equations of motion, with a suitable

prescription for the behaviour on the boundary. for instance, in the case of scalar
elds, interaction terms of the form

l(a) = 123
l(b) = gm n 1(m 2)(n 3)
give the following contributions to three point functions

ho1(x)o2(y)o3(z)i(a) = z d4xd
ho1(x)o2(y)o3(z)i(b) = z d4xd

5 k1(x, ; x, 0)k2(x, ; y, 0) 

k3(x, ; z, 0)

5 k1(x, ; x, 0)m k2(x, ; y, 0) 

2m k3(x, ; z, 0) ,

(5.30)

where 1, 2 and 3 are the dimensions of the operators coupled to 1, 2 and
3 respectively. equations (5.30) are obtained, analogously to the expressions for
two-point functions, by solving the equations of motion in the presence of the above

interaction terms and then substituting back into the action, whose exponential is
used as generating functional. to derive (5.30) one must solve the equations recur-
sively as a series in the coupling constant gs. to generate three-point functions it is
sucient to stop to the lowest order, so that the bulk to boundary propagators, ki
in (5.30) are the same entering two-point functions.

the contributions to three-point functions can be represented through a diagram
like the one depicted in gure 5.2, where the derivatives, read from the interaction,

eventually act on the bulk to boundary propagators.

164

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

figure 5.2: ads diagram for the correlator of three scalar operators

by writing explicitly (5.30) one immediately sees that these correlation functions
have the correct form required by conformal symmetry. actually, as will be discussed

in the case of r-currents, two-point functions in the boundary conformal eld theory
are determined by superconformal symmetry up to a constant, so that the comparison
with the results obtained from ads5 only allows to establish the map between the
elds on the two sides of the correspondence and to x the normalizations. analo-
gously three-point functions are strongly constrained. their supergravity calculation
in ads5 and comparison with eld theory only provides a check of the normalization
constants (ope coecients). a completely non-trivial check of the proposed corre-

spondence requires the computation of four- or higher-point functions, that will be
examined in subsequent sections.

the computation of two- and three-point functions of chiral primary operators
(cpos) will now be reviewed following [148, 145]. the chiral primary operators that

will be considered are of the form

(5.31)

where i are the six real matrix-valued scalar elds of n =4 supersymmetric yang

whose normalization is chosen such that ti1
i1...iti2 i1...i = i1i2. the free propagator for

chiral primary operators (5.31) belong to representations of the su(4) r-symmetry
group characterized by dynkin labels (0, , 0), they are lorentz scalars, i.e. they be-
long to the representation j1=j2=0 of the euclidean lorentz group so(4)=su(2)
su(2), and their conformal dimension is =. the class of cpos comprises the
operators qij and in particular q and q considered in section 4.5.

in general operators involved in the ads/cft correspondence have a conformal
dimension  that is not an integer. only operators belonging to short supermul-
tiplets of the su(2,2|4) superconformal group, which are dual to the massless ads
supergravity elds and their kk descendants, have a dimension that is protected un-

der renormalization [163]. in supersymmetric eld theories there are chiral primary

166

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

operators, like hose considered here, whose dimensions are integer and protected,
even if they are not conserved currents. in the case of n =4 super yangmills theory
under consideration the conformal dimension of a generic operator satises the bound

  q =  ,

(5.32)

where q is the charge of the eld under a u(1) subgroup of the su(4) r-symmetry

group. (5.32) is a bps-type bound, which follows from the superconformal algebra
(2.16).

as already discussed in the previous section the supergravity elds and the kaluza
klein states in d=5 n =8 gauged supergravity belong to short multiplets of the super-
isometry group su(2,2|4). the same is true for their counterparts in n =4 super
yangmills theory (where su(2,2|4) is the superconformal group). the cpos intro-
duced above play a central role in the construction of these multiplets. as explained
in [163] all these multiplets can be obtained starting from scalar chiral primary op-

erators like those in (5.31) and resorting to analytic superspace. the generic short
multiplet is described by a composite twisted chiral supereld [111] of the form

w() = tr(cid:0)w (i1 . . . w i)(cid:1)  traces ,

abw [ab] are the same introduced in chapter 2, equa-

where the superelds w i = 1
tions (2.7) and (2.8).

massive string states on the contrary are in long multiplets as well as their duals,

which are non chiral primary operators. an example of operators of this kind is
represented by the n =4 embedding of the konishi multiplet [164, 163], which, in
terms of n =1 superelds, is

 = iev i ,

(5.33)

where i, i = 1, 2, 3 are the n =1 chiral multiplets and v the n =1 vector multiplet
of n =4 super yangmills theory.

in [148] two- and three-point green functions of cpos have been computed using

type iib supergravity in ads5 and wittens prescription. the result is

the above correlators are found to agree perfectly with the free eld calculation in
n =4 super yangmills.

this result is expected to be valid only in the large n limit at xed and large g,
when the yangmills coupling gym goes to zero. however in [147] it was proved that
the one-loop corrections to the above correlators are zero. as a consequence the ads
calculation agrees with the exact perturbative contribution to two- and three-point
functions of cpos for arbitrary gym. this strongly suggests that the conjectured
correspondence should be valid at nite n as well. in [147] a component formulation
in terms of n =1 multiplets is employed. the chiral primary operators that are
considered are of the form

tr(cid:0)x (cid:1) = tr(cid:0)i1 . . . i(cid:1)
tr(cid:0)x(cid:1) = tr(cid:16)i1 . . . i(cid:17) ,

(5.34)

(5.35)

where i and i, with i = 1, 2, 3, are the complex scalar elds belonging to the chiral
multiplets. the action of the model in this formulation was given in equation (2.11).
the proof of the vanishing of the one-loop corrections to correlators of cpos
given in [147] is based on a non-renormalization theorem [165] for the two-point

function

htr(cid:0)x 2(cid:1)tr(cid:0)x2(cid:1)i =

tr(cid:0)x 2(cid:1)

tr(cid:0)x2(cid:1)

and on clever colour combinatorics. the non-renormalization theorem says that the
one loop correction to the above correlator vanishes. this is a consequence of the

following relations. the one-loop corrections to htr(cid:0)x 2(cid:1)tr(cid:0)x2(cid:1)i come from the dia-

notice that in the formulation of (2.11), that is used in [147], the wesszumino
gauge is exploited, so that the one loop corrections to the propagator, represented

by the bubbles in (5.37), are not zero. moreover the second term in (5.36) is the
contribution of the d-term, while the f -term does not enter. both b(x, y) and

a(x, y) are logarithmically divergent (see section 3.1), but one can prove the non-
renormalization theorem

b(x, y) + 2a(x, y) = 0 .

the one-loop correction to the two-point function htr(cid:0)x (cid:1)tr(cid:0)x(cid:1)i

tr(cid:0)x (cid:1)

tr(cid:0)x(cid:1)

comes from the sum of diagrams of the following types

one must consider the sum of contributions in which the two-particle interaction
structures (5.36) and (5.37) are inserted between each pair of lines.
in [147] it is

shown, through a combinatoric analysis, that this sum leads to a total one-loop
correction of the form

htr(cid:0)x kxk(cid:1)  kn

[b(x, y) + 2a(x, y)]

analogously one can prove the vanishing of the one-loop correction to the three

to summarize the expressions of two- and three-point functions of cpos in per-

turbation theory are given by the free-eld result and, as shown in [148], this coincides
with what is found in the supergravity calculation in ads5. as already remarked su-
persymmetry allows to generalize this result to all the composite operators of the

current multiplet. in [147] this has been explicitly veried for a three-point function
involving the operator e ab of equation (2.18), which is a descendant 4 of cpos.
notice that in this computation it is crucial to take into account the modication
(2.19) of the operator e ab in the non abelian case [89].

4e ab is a descendant under superconformal transformations, but a primary eld from the view-

point of conformal symmetry.

5.5 four-point functions

unlike two- and three-point functions which, as discussed in the previous section,
are completely determined by superconformal symmetry up to constants, four-point
functions are only determined up to an arbitrary function of two independent cross-

ratios, for instance those introduced in section 4.5

(5.39)

as a consequence the comparison of four-point amplitudes computed in supergrav-
ity/superstring theory in ads5 with super yangmills correlation functions would
represent a truly dynamical and non-trivial check of the correspondence. such a
check has been carried out, in an indirect way, for the non-perturbative correction to

a four-point function in [89] using the exact match of a correlation function of sixteen
fermionic operators in the same supersymmetry multiplet and will be reviewed in the

next section.

the calculation of four-point green functions of composite operators in n =4 su-
persymmetric yangmills is rather complicated. the application of n =1 superspace
techniques to this problem will be examined later.

on the supergravity/superstring side the computation of four- and higher-point
amplitudes with the approach of section 5.4 presents a new diculty, with respect to
the case of two- and threepoint functions, related to the existence of two kinds of

contributions, associated with contact and exchange diagrams.

figure 5.3: contact 4-point am-
plitude

figure 5.4: exchange 4-point am-
plitude

the former, see gure 5.3, are completely analogous to the above discussed contribu-
tions to two- and three-point functions, while the latter correspond to diagrams like

the one in gure 5.4 and, as a new feature, involve also bulk to bulk propagators in

5.5 four-point functions

171

ads5. the diagram of gure 5.4 represents an s-channel amplitude, analogously one
must take into account t and u channels. moreover one must consider the possible
exchange of all the states, for nite n also string states, coupled to the external ver-

tices in the supergravity/superstring action. the corresponding amplitude has the
form

a(x1, x2, x3, x4) =z d4xd
k(x, ; x2, 0)g(x, ; x, )k(x, ; x3, 0)k(x, ; x4, 0)] ,

[k(x, ; x1, 0)

where g(z; z) denotes the bulk to bulk propagator and, for compactness of notation,
indices and possible derivatives acting on the various lines, depending the explicit

form of the trilinear couplings, have been suppressed.

the rst computations of this kind have been presented in [166, 106] for scalar

four-point functions. the amplitudes considered are

a(x1, x2, x3, x4)

a(x1, x2, x3, x4)

a(x1, x2, x3, x4) ,

(5.40)

where  and =c (0) are the the two massless scalars of the type iib superstring, the
dilaton and the axion respectively. the operator corresponding to  is the glueball

eld g = tr (f 2), whereas  corresponds to c = tr(cid:16)f f(cid:17), so that the amplitudes

(5.40) should give the green functions

hg(x1)g(x2)g(x3)g(x4)i
hg(x1)c(x2)g(x3)c(x4)i
hc(x1)c(x2)c(x3)c(x4)i

in n =4 super yangmills.

notice that since the scalar elds  and  correspond to zeroth-order spherical har-
monics, one can forget about the s5 factor and consider  = (z) and  = (z) as
depending only on the ads5 coordinate.

172

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

in the case of the a amplitude the only exchange diagrams that contribute
involve the graviton propagator and at this order there are no contact terms, in the
a amplitude both the graviton and the axion propagators enter, while a re-
ceives contribution from the exchange of gravitons and dilatons. furthermore contact
diagrams contribute to a and a.

the fundamental diculty in the computation of the above amplitudes is the
construction of the propagators in the ads5 space. an interesting result has been
proved in [106]. it has been shown that the graphs corresponding to the -exchange in
the amplitude a actually coincide with the contact graph. this is a consequence
of the fact that the scalar bulk to bulk propagator g(z; z) satises an equation of
the form

zg(z; z) = (z  z)

in ads5. integrating by parts in the exchange amplitude, one obtains exactly a factor
zg(z; z) and hence one of the two integrations over ads5 can be performed using
the -function. however this result does not hold in general and so the knowledge of
the propagators for all the relevant elds in ads5 is necessary.

the ads5 propagator for scalar elds has been computed in [167], while the
propagator for gauge elds was given in [168]. the graviton propagator in ads5 has
been computed only very recently [169].

as already remarked in section 5.1 the type iib supergravity action contains

terms that receive also non-perturbative corrections from d-instantons. in particular
d-instantons contribute to the r4 term (5.7) and to the 16 term (5.8). as argued in
[170, 89] the corresponding contributions to supergravity/superstring amplitudes in
ads5 should be compared with instanton contributions to the correlation functions of
the associated composite operators in n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory. this
comparison has been achieved in [89] for the correlation functions presented in the

previous chapter (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). the results of [89] will be reviewed in the
following sections. notice that for the non-perturbative contribution to scattering
amplitudes, with the minimal number of insertions leading to a non-vanishing
result, only contact terms are relevant 5. as a consequence it is easy to single out
the contributions to be compared with the yangmills computations. in particular

notice that there is no ambiguity related to possible cancellations among contact and

5two- and three-point functions do not receive non-perturbative corrections at lowest order.

5.5 four-point functions

173

exchange integrals. moreover in general the contact non-perturbative contribution to

an amplitude has schematically the form

z d4xd

5 k1k2 . . . kn ,

which exactly coincides with the form expected for an instanton contribution in n =4
yangmills theory after the integrations over the fermionic collective coordinates have
been performed, since the one-instanton moduli space is exactly ads5 [89, 90, 91, 92]

and the instanton prole tr(cid:16)f

2

(cid:17) is identical to the bulk to boundary propagator

k for  = 4. this implies that the comparison with the yangmills calculation can
be performed before computing the integrals. these considerations will be exploited
in the next section, where specic examples will be considered.

some remarks on the computation of perturbative contributions to four-point

green functions will now be made. the calculation of correlation functions of com-
posite operators in n =4 super yangmills theory can be simplied using superspace
techniques. although the explicit calculations have not yet been completed the ap-
plication of this method to chiral primary operators will be briey sketched.

the approach followed in [147] and reviewed in the previous section for the com-
putation of three-point functions of cpos can be generalized to correlation functions
of n =1 superelds whose lowest components are chiral primary operators of the form
of equation (5.35). the superelds to be considered are of the form

tr(cid:16)i (cid:17) ,

tr(cid:16)i

(cid:17) ,

i = 1, 2, 3 .

(5.43)

the simplest case, =2, will be discussed here. exploiting the su(3) symmetry, that
is manifest in the n =1 formulation, one can restrict to green functions with xed
values of the indices i, which allows to simplify the calculation. the chiral primary
operators with  = 2 are the scalars qij in (2.18). the operators qij belong to the 20r
of the su(4) r-symmetry group, which decomposes with respect to the su(3)u(1)
subgroup that is manifest in the n =1 formulation according to

20r  6 4

(5.44)

where the subscript on the right hand side refers to the u(1) charge. the correspond-

(5.45)

174

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

for the sake of simplicity the attention will be restricted to green functions of oper-
ators oij

6 and o6 ij.

hence one type of four-point functions that one must consider is of the form

g(a)

i = htr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17) tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17) tr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17) tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)i ,

with xed i. there are two dierent tree-level contributions, corresponding to the

diagrams (the notations are the same as in chapter 3)

tr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17)

the connected diagram is proportional to n 2 while the disconnected one goes like n 4.
the only non-vanishing corrections to this green function come from the diagrams

tr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17)

plus the analogous diagrams in which the v v internal propagator is inserted between

dierent pairs of external lines. notice in particular that the following correction,

5.5 four-point functions

obtained from the disconnected diagram,

tr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17)

is trivially zero because of colour contractions. moreover working in the supereld
formalism and choosing the fermifeynman gauge, there are no corrections to the

propagators to be included. also, because of the non-renormalization properties
of two-point functions discussed in the previous section, there is no non-vanishing

disconnected diagram contributing to the four-point function at rst or higher order.

a second kind of four-point functions is of the form

g(b)

ij = htr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17) tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17) tr(cid:16)j

2(cid:17) tr(cid:16)j 2(cid:17)i ,

with i 6= j. in this case the only tree-level diagram is disconnected

tr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)j

2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)j 2(cid:17)

and goes as n 4. there is a unique non vanishing rst order correction corresponding

176

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

to the connected diagram

tr(cid:16)i

2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)i 2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)j

2(cid:17)

tr(cid:16)j 2(cid:17)

where the internal propagator corresponds to the exchange of a chiral supereld with
index k 6= i 6= j. just like in the previous case there is no disconnected rst order
correction because of the non-renormalization properties of two-point functions.

the previous diagrams can be evaluated using the techniques of chapter 3. since
the points where the composite operators are inserted are external and not interaction
points the result will not be local in the fermionic variables of n =1 superspace. this
is not in agreement with the results of a calculation presented in [171].

an analysis similar to the one described here has been carried out in [172] em-
ploying a formulation of the model in n =2 harmonic superspace. in [172] four-point
functions are explicitly computed in terms of polylogarithm functions. the expres-

sions obtained resemble the one that was obtained in section 4.5 from the instanton
contribution to the correlator hqqqqi.

it has been observed by various authors [166, 106, 109, 107, 108, 173, 174] that the
four-point functions computed in the ads/cft correspondence develop logarithmic

singularities, when the limit of two coincident points is considered. this kind of
behaviour has already been pointed out in section 4.5. in all the papers [166, 106,

109, 107, 173, 174] the short-distance behaviour has been shown taking the limit in
the unintegrated expression obtained from the supergravity amplitude in ads5. this
is rather subtle because the exchange of limit and integration might be problematic,
moreover, as observed in [106], there could be compensations among various ads

diagrams. however this kind of cancellations cannot take place in the cases considered
in [107, 108].
in particular in [107] some non-perturbative contributions from d-
instantons to the four-point functions of scalar operators corresponding the dilaton

and axion elds has been considered. the results of section 4.5, where the instanton
contribution to the four-point function gq4 has been given explicitly, unconfutably
show the logarithmic behaviour. a satisfactory explanation of the origin of these

5.6 d-instanton eects

177

singularities as well as of the reason for the lack of the expected pole-type singularities

has not been proposed yet. in [109] an interesting analysis relating the contribution of
contact and exchange amplitudes in ads to the ope of the corresponding operators
in n =4 super yangmills has been given, using the technique of conformal partial
wave expansion, but the possible cancellation of logarithms between the two types

of contributions has not been excluded.

from the point of view of the boundary conformal eld theory the central point

appears to be the presence of anomalous dimensions for some operators that does
not violate the conformal symmetry. this issue is under active investigation [110]
and will be briey addressed in the concluding remarks. notice however that the be-
haviour of the correlation function gq4 for coincident points does not violate the non-
renormalization theorems for three-point functions of the previous section, so that

such non-renormalization properties could be generalizable to the non-perturbative
level, at least for protected operators. in fact the limit in which two q or two q op-
erators are taken to coincide in gq4, that would correspond to one of the three-point
functions that are expected to be tree-level exact, gives a vanishing result thanks to

the pre-factor in equation (4.43).

5.6 d-instanton eects in d=10 type iib super-

string theory

as already discussed the low energy type iib supergravity action contains a f4(,  )r4
term as well as a supersymmetry related f16(,  )16 term. both of these terms receive
contributions from d-instantons of the type iib theory.

the ads/cft correspondence described in the previous section allows to asso-

ciate to these terms well dened contributions to correlation functions of compos-
ite operators in the boundary yangmills theory.
it is natural to expect that the
d-instanton generated terms should be related to instanton eects in n =4 super
yangmills.

the type iib d-instantons are dirichlet p = 1 branes, i.e. they are localized
objects in ten-dimensional space-time, which means that they have a zero-dimensional
world-volume. the charge-k d-instanton in at ten-dimensional space-time is a

nite-action solution of the classical euclidean equations of motion in which the
metric (in the einstein frame) is at and the complex scalar,  =  + ie, has a
non-trivial prole with a singularity at the position of the d-instanton, whereas the

178

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

other elds vanish [175]. moreover the d-instanton is a bps saturated conguration

preserving half of the supersymmetries.
in the following the constant expectation
values of the dilaton and the axion in the zero instanton sector will be denoted by
 and  respectively, while hatted symbols will refer to the classical d-instanton
solution.

to compute the scalar part of the type iib action in the d-instanton background
it is useful to dualize the r  r scalar,  = c (0), to an eight-form potential, c (8).
since the metric is trivial, the action (up to constants) can be put in the form

s =

=

1

4z (cid:0)d  e  dc (8)(cid:1)  (cid:0)d  e  dc (8)(cid:1) 
4z (cid:0)d  e  dc (8)(cid:1)  (cid:0)d  e  dc (8)(cid:1)

2z ed  dc (8) =

edc (8) ,

1

(5.46)

where m denotes the boundary of space-time, that in the presence of the d-instanton

is understood as made of the sphere at innity and an innitesimal sphere around the
location of the instanton. the rst term in (5.46) is semi-positive denite, so that it

follows that the action satises a bogomolnyi bound

s

2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)zm

edc (8)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) .

(5.47)

minimizing the action yields a bps condition relating  and c (8), which, expressed
in terms of , becomes [175]

 = ie .

(5.48)

the d-instanton solution is constructed through the ansatz

 =  + if (r) ,

where r = |x  x0| and f (r)  0, as r  . after imposing (5.48) the equation
for the dilaton outside a sphere centered at the d-instanton location becomes

ege = 0 .

the solution is the harmonic function [175]

e (10)

= gs +

3k4

4|x  x0|8 .

(5.49)

(5.50)

5.6 d-instanton eects

179

where x  is the ten-dimensional coordinate and x 
0 is the location of the d-instanton.
in (5.50) gs is the asymptotic value of the string coupling and the normalization of
the second term has a quantized value [175] by virtue of a condition analogous to the

diracnepomechieteitelboim condition that quantizes the charge of an electrically
charged p-brane and of its magnetically charged p-brane dual [176]. it is notable that
the solution in (5.50) is simply the green function for a scalar eld to propagate from
x0 to x subject to the boundary condition that e = gs at |x|   or |x0|  .
the solution for  follows from (5.48) and is of the form

 =  + i(cid:18)a 

1
gs

+ e (cid:19) ,

(5.51)

where a is an arbitrary constant.

the action for a single d-instanton receives contribution only from the bound-

ary term in (5.46), i.e. from the integration over the sphere at innity and over an
innitesimal sphere around x0. the arbitrariness in the constant a can be used to
simplify the computation. in particular with the choice a=0 in (5.51) the entire d-
instanton action comes from the boundary of the innitesimal sphere. substituting

for f from (5.51) gives

sk =

2|k|
gs

.

(5.52)

on the other hand, with the choice a = 1
in (5.51) the expression (5.46) reduces to
gs
an integral over the boundary at innity, but the total action remains the same as
sk in (5.52).

the bosonic zero-modes associated with the d-instanton solution are parameter-
ized by the coordinates x 
0 of the center of the d-instanton. as already remarked
the d-instanton background breaks half of the supersymmetries. the fermionic zero-
modes can be generated by acting with the broken supersymmetries on the scalar

solution.

the d-instanton contributions to the eective action of type iib supergravity can

be deduced by studying scattering amplitudes in the instanton background. in this
way one obtains in particular the corrections to the r4 and 16 terms in equations
(5.7) and (5.8) [114, 130].

in [170] it was pointed out that the r4 term vanishes when computed in the
ads5  s5 background, because it involves a fourth power of the (vanishing) weyl
tensor. the rst, second and third functional derivatives of r4 vanish as well, and as

180

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

a result one nds no corrections to zero, one, two and three-point amplitudes when
the r4 term acts as source for yangmills operators on the boundary. however, there
is a non-zero four-graviton amplitude arising from this term. the boundary values of

these gravitons are sources for various bosonic components of the yangmills current
supermultiplet. for example, the components of the metric in the ads5 directions
couple to the stress tensor, t , whereas the traceless components polarized in the s5
directions couple to massive kaluza-klein states. a linear combination of the trace
of the metric on s5 and the uctuation of the r  r four-form potential couples to
the scalar components, qij. as a consequence the instanton contribution to the four-
point correlation function gq4 computed in the previous chapter should be related
to the appropriate d-instanton correction extracted from f4(,  )r4. however it is
extremely laborious to single out the exact terms to be compared with the yangmills

computation, so that it will be convenient to show the matching of the d-instanton
correction to the 16 term with the g 16 green function of section 4.6.

all the other terms of the same dimension, that are related to r4 by supersymme-
try can be picked out, for example, associating the physical elds with the components

of an on-shell type iib supereld [177]. as already remarked included among these
is the sixteen-fermion interaction (5.8). supersymmetry arguments [178, 179] imply
that the functions f16 and f4 are related by the action of sl(2,z) modular covariant
derivatives

f16(,  ) = (2d)12f4(,  ) ,

(5.53)

2

 + 2i q

where d= 
is the covariant derivative that maps a (q, p) modular form into a
(q +2, p) form (where the notation (q, p) labels the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
sl(2,z) weights of the form). whereas f4 transforms with modular weight (0, 0), the
function f16 has weight (12,12) and therefore transforms with a non-trivial phase
under sl(2,z). this is precisely the phase required to compensate for the anomalous
u(1)b transformation of the 16 s, so that the full expression (5.8) is invariant under
the sl(2,z) s-duality group.

in the small coupling limit, all of these terms can be expanded in the form

while the last one has the appropriate weight of e2ik to be associated with a charge-
k d-instanton eect. anti-d-instanton contributions have not been displayed. the
coecients ck
k,n as well as the d-instanton partition functions k are explicitly given
in [130]. the coecient of the leading term in the series of perturbative uctuations
around a charge-k d-instanton is independent of which particular interaction term

is being discussed and reads

zk = k(ke)7/2e2ik .

it should be identied with the contribution of a charge-k d-instanton to the measure

in string frame which, up to an overall numerical factor, reads

d(s)

k = ()1d10x d16 zk .

(5.55)

actually there are subtleties in doing this, since the full series is not convergent, it is
rather an asymptotic approximation to a bessel function.

5.6.1 testing the ads/cft correspondence: type iib d-

instantons vs. yangmills instantons

as observed in [170] the charge-k d-instanton action that appears in the exponent in
(5.6) coincides with the action of a charge-k yangmills instanton in the boundary
theory, which indicates a correspondence between these sources of non-perturbative

eects. this idea is reinforced by the correspondence between other factors. for ex-
g2
4 and  = l2n1/2g1
ample, after substituting e =
ym, the measure (5.55) contains
ym
an overall factor of the coupling constant in the form g8
ym. indeed, this is exactly the
power expected on the basis of the ads/cft correspondence, since the one-instanton
contribution to the green functions in the n = 4 yangmills theory, considered in
chapter 4, also has a factor of g8
ym arising from the combination of the bosonic and
fermionic zero-mode norms.
in this section the leading instanton contributions to
type iib superstring amplitudes will be compared with the corresponding n =4 cur-
rent correlators considered in chapter 4. in the next section the same analysis will be
carried out studying the semiclassical uctuations around the ads5  s5 d-instanton
solution.

to compare the yangmills instanton calculation with an amplitude obtained
according to maldacenas prescription one must expand the function f16(,  ) in (5.53)

182

to extract the one-instanton term. in order to compare with the yangmills sixteen-

point correlator one needs to consider the situation in which all sixteen fermions
propagate to well dened congurations on the boundary.

equation (5.28) leads to the normalized bulk-to-boundary propagator of the fer-
2l , associated to the composite operator  of

(5.57)

where j(x) is a left-handed boundary value of  and acts as the source for the
composite operator  in the boundary n =4 yangmills theory. as a result, the
classical action for the operator ()16 in the type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 is

constant comes from the factor of (e) 25

factor of 1
 in front of the 16 term in the type iib action, which using the relation

where an overall numerical constant has been dropped. using the dictionary (5.15)
and dierentiating with respect to the chiral sources this result agrees with the ex-
pression (4.55) of section 4.6 obtained in the yang mills calculation. in particular
the overall power of gym in (4.55) is reproduced after introducing the same rescaling
of each  in (5.58) by a factor of 4gs as in equation (4.53). actually the overall
numerical constant has not been checked, see however [92]. notice that to match

the result of the yangmills calculation it is crucial that in the product of sixteen
matrices k f
 are picked
out. this is ensured by the contraction with t16, which selects the correct number
of factors of each kind.
in the next section this expression will also be motivated
directly by semi-classical quantization around a d-instanton eld conguration that
is a euclidean solution of the type iib supergravity in ads5  s5.

the agreement of the 16 amplitude with the corresponding sixteen-current corre-
lation function of chapter 4 is sucient to guarantee that the instanton contributions
to all the other yangmills correlation functions, that are related to this term by
n =4 supersymmetry, will also agree with their type iib superstring counterparts.
for example, the correlation function that has been considered in most detail in chap-
ter 4 was the one with four superconformal scalar currents qij which are in the 20r
of su(4), and have dimension =2 and ads mass m2 =  4
l2 . as already discussed
the supergravity eld, qij, that couples to qij is a linear combination of the uc-
tuation of the trace of the metric on s5, h m
m , and of the four-form eld potential,
c (4)
m n p q = m n p qrrf . therefore, contributions to the correlation of four of these
composite scalars in the one d-instanton background should correspond to the lead-
ing parts of the k=1 terms in the expansion of the r4 interaction (5.7) as well as
. these last two terms involve f (5), the
self-dual eld strength of the antisymmetric four-form potential, and are related by
supersymmetry to the r4 term.

terms of the form r2(cid:0)f (5)(cid:1)2

and(cid:0)f (5)(cid:1)4

it follows from the structure of (4.40) that the yangmills instanton contribution
to each factor of qij is of the form k2(x
0 , 0; x, 0), where the two derivatives
are not necessarily contracted. but this is the expected form for a propagator from
the ads5  s5 bulk to the boundary for a scalar eld of dimension 2. therefore,
at least the general form of the expression obtained from the k=1 terms in the
expansion of r4 and the related f (5) interactions agrees with the four-qij correlation
function in a yangmills instanton background. in order to see this agreement in more
and
interactions that contain the uctuations of f (5). the k=1 contribution to
the amplitude of four uctuations of the appropriate combination of h m
m and f can
then be extracted from these interaction terms. although this computation has not

detail it would rst be necessary to determine the precise form of the(cid:0)f (5)(cid:1)2
(cid:0)f (5)(cid:1)4

been performed explicitly, the result is guaranteed to reproduce the k=1 expression
obtained from the yangmills theory in chapter 4 since it is related by supersymmetry
to the 16 amplitude.

184

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

the analogous comparison of the correlation function of eight e abs with the am-
plitude for eight eabs in the type iib superstring theory proceeds in much the same
way. the supergravity elds, eab, that couple to e ab arise from the internal compo-
nents of the complex type iib antisymmetric tensor. supersymmetry relates an h 8
term, where h is the complex combination of the type iib three-form eld-strengths,
h1 and h2, introduced in (5.6), to the r4 term in the type iib eective action. one
thus expects interactions schematically of the form (k3)8, with various contrac-
tions of the derivatives. using the explicit form of the spinor collective coordinates
 a = (0a + (x  x0) a)/0 one may check that the gaugino bilinears e ab

in the one-instanton background exactly give rise to k3 and derivatives thereof, as
expected for the scalar propagator of a scalar eld of dimension =3 and ads mass
m2 =  1
l2 . although a precise matching of the resulting amplitudes has not been
performed, one may appeal to supersymmetry arguments to determine the complete
structure of these terms.

notice that the above considered non-perturbative terms in the type iib su-
pergravity eective action when expanded around the ads5  s5 background give
rise to both derivative and non-derivative interaction terms. the matching of the
non-derivative mass-related terms considered here with corresponding terms in the
yangmills green functions is rather straightforward, but clearly it is only a hint to

the conjectured correspondence.

5.7 the d-instanton solution in ads5  s5

the results of the previous section will now be reinforced by studying how the ()1
terms in the type iib eective action can be determined by semi-classical type iib
supergravity eld theory calculation in a d-instanton background.

the solution of the equations of motion of the type iib theory in euclidean
ads5  s5 will be now discussed. the bps condition for a d-instanton in this
background is identical to (5.48) and together with the equation of motion for the
dilaton leads to

ge = 0

(5.59)

and determines the complex scalar  . in the einstein frame the einstein equations are
unaltered by the presence of the d-instanton, because the associated euclidean stress
energy tensor vanishes. as a consequence ads5  s5 remains a solution. equation

5.7 ads5  s 5 d-instanton solution

185

(5.59) is identical to the equation for the green function of a massless scalar propa-
gating between the location of the d-instanton (x
0) and the point (x, yi), which
is the bulk-to-bulk propagator (subject to the boundary condition that it is constant
in the limits   0 and   ). this is easy to solve using the conformal atness of
ads5 s5. in cartesian coordinates x  = (x, yi), (5.14) reads ds2 = l22dx  dx,
where 2 = y  y and the solution of (5.59) with a constant asymptotic behavior is of
the form

where 0 = |y0| and e (10) is the harmonic function that appeared in the at ten-

interested in the case in which the point (x, yi) approaches the boundary (  |y| 
0), in which case it is necessary to rescale the dilaton prole (just as it is necessary

to rescale the scalar bulk-to-bulk propagator, [118, 119]), so that the combination

mills instanton is replaced by the distance 0 of the d-instanton from the boundary.
this is another indication of how the geometry of the yangmills theory is encoded in
the type iib superstring. note, in particular, that as the d-instanton approaches the
boundary 0  0, the expression for 4e  reduces to a  function that corresponds
to a zero-size yangmills instanton.

(5.63)

186

chapter 5. ads/scft correspondence

since the action is independent of constant shifts of , actually it does not depend on

the arbitrary constant, a. in a manner that follows closely the at ten-dimensional
case considered in the appendix of [114] and reviewed in the preceding section, the

action for a charge k d-instanton can be written as

sk = 

l10

()4z dd4xd5

5

g(e2 f f ) ,

(5.64)

which reduces to an integral over the boundaries of ads5  s5 and the surface of an
innitesimal sphere centered on the d-instanton at x = x0, y = y0. the result is
exactly the same as in the at case

sk =

2|k|
gs

.

(5.65)

by choosing a = 1
in (5.63) the expression (5.64) reduces to an integral over the
gs
boundary at  = 0. remarkably, in this case the boundary integrand is identical to

the action density of the standard four-dimensional yangmills instanton.

whereas the ads5  s5 metric remains unchanged by the presence of the d-
instanton in the einstein frame, it is radically altered in the string frame where the
instanton is manifested as a space-time wormhole (as in the at ten-dimensional case
[175]). for nite values of k the dilaton becomes large in the planck-scale neck and

the classical solution is not reliable in that region. however, for very large instanton
number, the neck region becomes much larger than the planck scale so, by analogy

with the d-brane examples studied in [38], it should be very interesting to study the
implications of the modied ads5  s5 geometry in the large-k limit of the large-n
theory.

the d-instanton contribution to the amplitude with sixteen external dilatinos,
a
 , may now be obtained directly by semi-classical quantization around the classical
d-instanton solution in ads5  s5. the leading instanton contribution can be deter-
mined by applying supersymmetry transformations to the scalar eld which has an

instanton prole given by (5.61). since the d-instanton background breaks half the
supersymmetries the relevant transformations are those in which the supersymmetry

parameter corresponds to the killing spinors for the sixteen broken supersymmetries.
these killing spinors have u(1)b charge 1
2 and are dened by a modied version of
(5.17) that includes the non-trivial composite u(1)b connection, qm [126], that is
made from the type iib scalar eld [175]

in similar manner the instanton proles of all the elds in the supergravity mul-
tiplet follow by applying the broken supersymmetries to pm the appropriate number
of times, just as in the at ten-dimensional case [114]. the single d-instanton con-

tributions to any correlation function can then be determined. this is guaranteed to
agree with the corresponding term in the expansion of the eective type iib action
as well as with the corresponding n =4 yangmills correlation function.

conclusions

this dissertation reports the study of various aspects of n =4 supersymmetric yang
mills theory.

the perturbative niteness properties of the theory have been known for a long
time. however the analysis presented here allows to point out several problems in

the perturbative computation of green functions of elementary (super) elds. the
calculations reviewed in chapter 3 show that the gauge-xing procedure is quite prob-
lematic and presents subtleties both in the description in terms of component elds
and using the n =1 supereld formalism. the appearance of uv divergences in
o-shell propagators, when the wesszumino gauge in components is exploited, has

been discussed and it has been shown that relaxing the choice of the wz gauge such
divergences are cancelled. dierent diculties have been encountered in superspace

computations: the supersymmetric generalization of the fermifeynman gauge ap-
pears to be privileged since any dierent choice of gauge leads to ir divergences in

o-shell green functions.

these issues have been studied in a systematic way in chapter 3. the divergences

found in one-loop calculations are expected to be gauge artifacts, and it would be
interesting to obtain an explicit check of the cancellation of such divergences in gauge

invariant green functions. as briey discussed in the nal chapter in the context of
the ads/scft correspondence, superspace techniques can be applied to the calcu-
lation of correlation functions of gauge-invariant composite operators as well. n =1
superelds should prove a powerful tool in this computations like in the case of ele-
mentary elds.

at the perturbative level the eect of the inclusion of mass terms for the (anti)

chiral superelds has also been discussed. the considered mass terms break super-

189

190

conclusions

symmetry down to n =1, but it is explicitly proved, at the one loop-level, that the
ultraviolet properties of the model are not aected by this modication. the same re-
sult had been obtained long ago by means of dimensional arguments and is reinforced

by the analysis presented here.

the possibility of employing this mass deformed n =4 model as a supersymmetry
preserving regularization scheme for n =1 theories has been recently proposed. as
observed in chapter 3 this approach should be generalizable to n =2 theories.

non perturbative eects in n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory are studied in
chapter 4 with the aid of instanton calculus. the literature on n =4 super yangmills
contains examples of instanton computations of corrections to the eective action in

the abelian coulomb phase. the calculations presented in chapter 4 have been
performed in the superconformal phase, corresponding to the origin of the moduli
space, which is related to type iib superstring theory in ads5  s5 by the duality
recently proposed by maldacena. in particular an exact eld theoretical computation
of the one-instanton contribution (in the semiclassical approximation) to a four-point

function of scalar composite operators belonging to the current supermultiplet has
been reported.

the non-perturbative corrections to green functions in n =4 supersymmetric
yangmills theory have been subsequently reconsidered in the context of the ads/cft
correspondence. previous checks of the conjectured correspondence had been ob-

tained for two- and three-point functions at the perturbative level. the results re-
viewed here strongly support the possibility of extending the correspondence at the
non-perturbative level as well. the agreement found between the contributions to

four- and higher-point functions due to two dierent sources of non-perturbative ef-
fects, instantons in n =4 super yangmills and d-instantons in type iib superstring
theory, represents a highly non trivial check of the conjecture. furthermore these
results have been obtained in the case of a su(2) gauge group and therefore suggest

that the correspondence, originally formulated for a su(n) gauge group in the large
n limit, may actually hold at nite n as well. perturbative checks of this claim have

already been proposed, but the non-perturbative results discussed here bring stronger
evidence in this direction, since they concern four- and higher-point functions that
are not xed by superconformal symmetry. despite these interesting results on the

eld theory side, there is still very little understanding of the correct way of dealing
with string corrections to the supergravity approximation for nite n. this is a very

interesting subject for future developments. in particular generalizations of the orig-

conclusions

191

inal conjecture to theories with less supersymmetry and even to non-supersymmetric

theories have been proposed.
in this context computations of quantities of phe-
nomenological interest, such as glueball spectra, have been performed. however the

possibility of comparing this results with, for instance, the continuum extrapolations
from lattice simulations requires the extension of the correspondence to weak t hooft

coupling, i.e. to nite n including string eects.

the four-point correlation function computed in chapter 4 displays logarithmic

singularities when any two insertion points are taken to coincide. this peculiar
behaviour in the operator product expansion (ope) has also been observed by other
authors in supergravity calculations in ads5 and is a very interesting feature of the
superconformal eld theory at hand.

in understanding this phenomenon a crucial role is played by the fact that the
chiral primary operators, o
q , that enter the green functions under consideration
are protected, i.e. their dimension  and charge q are related by  = q. the rst

point to observe is the absence of pole-type singularities in the ope. this is a direct
consequence of the condition  = q. if one considers the ope for chiral primary
operators with charges q1 and q2,

o(q1)(x)o(q2)(y)

for

|x  y|  0 ,

there are two possibilities. either the ope contains only chiral primary operators

and one has

o(q1)(x)o(q2)(y)  co

(q1+q2)(cid:18)x + y

2 (cid:19) + terms vanishing as

|x  y|  0 ,

with  = q1 + q2 and c a numerical constant, or there is a mixing with a non chiral
primary operator, whose dimension is strictly larger than the charge, and then

o(q1)(x)o(q2)(y)  v 

q (cid:18) x + y

2 (cid:19) + . . . ,

where q = q1 + q2 and  = q1 + q2 +  > q1 + q2. as a consequence in any case
there cannot be a pole-type singularity. the second situation described here could be
responsible for the logarithmic behaviour. the anomalous dimension  is determined
by the calculation of the three point function hvooi, that is obtained by taking the
limit of coincident points in a four-point function of chiral primary operators like the
one that is computed in chapter 4. notice that one cannot study the limit in a three-

point function, since three-point functions of chiral primaries are not renormalized.

192

conclusions

the logarithmically divergent coecient in the ope of o(q1) and o(q2) could originate
from a perturbative expansion of  = (g). more precisely if the operator v has an
anomalous dimension, , in perturbation theory the latter is expected to be small
and to admit an expansion in the coupling constant g. expanding o(q1)(x)o(q2)(y)
in powers of  yields

where an arbitrary mass scale  has been introduced for dimensional reasons. at each

non-trivial order in g, the last equation seems to violate conformal invariance. the
exact expression is however conformally invariant by construction. one can reconcile
the two results by observing that because of the presence of an anomalous dimension,

the operator has to be renormalized at each order in g and as a consequence it does
not provide a linear representation of the conformal group.

a covariant formulation can be given using the language of dierential forms. the
free equations can be written

d f = 0 ,

1d  f = 0 ,

where (f ) = 1
2f  and d denotes the external derivative. the duality trans-
formation simply becomes f  f . in the presence of electric sources the equations
become

e = (e,~je), so that the symmetry is broken. to
where j is a one-form of components j
recover the duality symmetry magnetic source terms must be included symmetrizing
the equations as follows

df = jm ,

1d  f = je .

the system is then symmetric under the simultaneous exchange of f with f and of
je with jm.

even if the inclusion of magnetic point-like particles in classical electromagnetism

seems to be ruled out by the experimental results, it allows to derive a consequence
that is of fundamental importance in the more interesting case of non abelian theories,
the dirac quantization condition. a consistent quantization 1 of a theory with both
electric and magnetic charges qi and gj requires that they satisfy the condition

qi  gj = 2nij ,

(b.3)

where nij are arbitrary integers.

the quantum mechanical description of a charged particle in an electromagnetic
eld requires the introduction of the vector potential a, related to the eld strength
~a). this leads to the

(b.4)

in the presence of a point like magnetic charge it is not possible to associate a globally
dened vector potential to the magnetic eld through ~b = ~  ~a. however it is
possible to construct a well dened vector potential in the northern hemisfere ( ~an )
and in the southern hemisfere ( ~as ). this is physically consistent if the elds ~an
and ~as dier by a gauge transformation on the overlapping region (the plane of the
equator)

1strikingly the dirac quantization condition can be already derived in the context of classical

electromagnetism.

and analogously for the wave function

  s|eq .

by means of stokes theorem one obtains

g =zs3

d~  ~b =zeq

d~  ~an zeq

d~  ~as = (2)  (0) .

but the wave function  must be single valued along the equator requiring from
(b.4) (2)  (0) = 2
q n which leads to the dirac quantization condition, qg =
2n, with n  z. the relation (b.3) is not invariant under the continuous duality
transformation (b.2), but it can be generalized to the so called dirac-schwinger-
zwanziger condition [57] that is invariant. the latter applies to a system containing

two dyonic states (i.e. states possessing both electric and magnetic charge) of charges
(qi, gi) and (qj, gj) and reads

qigj  qjgi = 2nij .

b.2 non abelian case: the t hooftpolyakov

monopole

as discussed in the preceding section magnetic monopoles must be included at hand in

a purely electromagnetic model and there exist no experimental evidence justifying
this construction.
in non abelian gauge theories on the contrary monopoles and

dyons emerge naturally in association with particular eld congurations.
indeed
non abelian gauge theories admit solitonic solutions of the classical equations of

motion that can be interpreted as describing monopole (and in general dyon) states
in the quantum theory. the case of the t hooftpolyakov monopole [180, 181] in the

georgiglashow model with gauge group su(2) will be considered here. the results
can be generalized to a larger gauge group g by, for example, embedding a su(2)
factor in g.

the georgiglashow model is dened by the lagrangian

l =

(b.5)

where f a

elds a are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group su(2) with covariant

derivative 2 da = a + eabcabc. the potential v () is

so that the classical equations of motion are

v () =



4(cid:0)aa  v2(cid:1)2 ,

df a = abcbdc

(dd)a = a(bb  v2) .
furthermore f satises the bianchi identity d(f ) = 0.

the total energy for a given eld conguration is

(b.6)

e =z d3x 00 =z d3x(cid:26)(cid:20)1

2

(ba

i )2 + (ea

i )2 + (a)2 + [(di)a]2(cid:21) + v ()(cid:27) , (b.7)

where a is the momentum conjugate to a and ea
electric and magnetic elds

i and ba

i are the non abelian

0i = ea
f a
i ,

f a
ij = ijkbak .

the energy density 00 is semi-positive denite, 00  0, with equality if and only
 = da = v () = 0, implying that the vacuum of the theory corresponds to
if f a
congurations with vanishing aa
 and constant a satisfying aa = v2. the set of
congurations corresponding to the higgs vacuum (moduli space) will be denoted by
mh

mh = { : da = 0 , v () = 0}

in the case at hand mh is the sphere s2 parametrized by the coordinates a
constrained by aa = v2.

for v 6= 0 the gauge symmetry is broken to u(1) and the higgs mechanism
produces a perturbative spectrum which consists of a massless photon, massive
bosons w  with mass mw = ev and a massive higgs scalar with mass mh = 2v.
in addition to the constant vacuum solution the classical equations of motion
admit solitonic solutions corresponding to static eld congurations with nite (and
non-vanishing) energy. in order to have nite energy the elds a must approach
(suciently rapidly) values in mh for large values of the radial coordinate r, so that
  mh. for the georgiglashow model one has mh = s2
they dene a map  : s2

2from now on natural units will be used so that  = c = 1.

202

appendix b. electric-magnetic duality

and the corresponding solitonic congurations are characterized by an integer winding
number n  2(s2)  z. it can be shown [182] that the most general solution for
the gauge eld is

aa

with an arbitrary k. the resulting eld strength is

the conguration (aa

equation (b.9) shows that the magnetic particle satises the dirac quantization
condition, eg = 4n. notice that the non abelian eld strength is aligned along the
higgs eld outside the core of the monopole. the magnetic charge g can be written

in the form

g =

d~  ~baa =

vz d3x ~ba( ~d)a ,

which follows from stokes theorem and the bianchi identity, which implies dibi = 0.

b.2 t hooftpolyakov monopole

203

for a static conguration with vanishing electric eld one then nds that the

mass given by (b.7) satises the bogomolnyi bound

mm  v|g| .

(b.10)

in (b.10) the equality holds if and only if v () = 0 identically (i.e.  = 0 in the
georgiglashow model) and the rst order bogomolnyi equation

ba

i = dia

(b.11)

is satised.

an explicit solution for the monopole eld conguration can be found in the
special case of spherical symmetry and if the bogomolnyi bound is saturated. a

eld conguration corresponding to a non trivial vacuum cannot be invariant either
under the group of spatial rotations so(3)r or under the su(2)g group of global
gauge transformations 3. however a solution invariant under the diagonal so(3)
subgroup of so(3)rsu(2)g can be obtained through the ansatz

a =

xa
er2 h() , aa

0 = 0 , aa

i = a

xj
er2 [1  k()] ,

ij

where r = |x|,  = ver and the functions h and k satisfy k()  1, h()  0 for
r  0 and k()  0, h()/  1 for r  . in the limit in which the bogomolnyi
bound is saturated an explicit solution was derived by prasad and sommereld [183].
the exact form of the solution will not be discussed here since it will not be relevant

for future considerations.

in general a non trivial vacuum in the limit v () = 0 (bps limit 4) is rather un-
natural and moreover the condition of vanishing potential is expected to be broken by
quantum eects. however in supersymmetric theories this situation is perfectly con-

sistent because of the presence of at directions that are protected by supersymmetry.
the construction leading to the monopoles considered so far can be generalized to
the case of non vanishing electric eld giving rise to congurations with both electric
and magnetic charge (dyons) [184] 5; for such states the bogomolnyi bound becomes

3gauge transformations that do not reduce to the identity at spatial innity are referred to as

md  vpe2 + g2 .

global or large gauge transformations.

4field congurations saturating the bogomolnyi bound are called bps saturated.
5static dyon solutions corresponding to nite energy congurations cannot be constructed in the

temporal gauge a0 = 0

the lagrangian (b.5) can be modied by the introduction of a -term

in the presence of a  term the dyons acquire an additional electric charge [185]

b.3 monopoles and fermions

in realistic models the gauge elds are coupled to fermions and one is then led to
consider monopole congurations in the presence of fermions. the coupling to spinors

in a monopole background has important consequences that will be briey discussed
here in the simplest case of gauge group su(2).

dirac fermions can be coupled to the georgiglashow model by adding to (b.5)

the term

lf =

nfxk=1

k

i

dk  if 

k

k .

(b.16)

the dirac equation reads

(id  )k = 0

b.3 monopoles and fermions

205

and a suitable choice for the -matrices is

0 =(cid:18) 0 i

0 (cid:19) ,

i

i =(cid:18) ii

0

0

ii (cid:19) .

in the background of a monopole one can look for a solution for k in the form

k(x, t) = eietk(x) ,

with k(x) =  k

k

+(x)

(x) !. the weyl spinors k

 then satisfy the equations

/dk

/dk

+ = (iidi + )k
 = (iidi  )k

 = ek
+
+ = ek
 ,

which in general have both positive energy (e >0) and zero energy (e=0) solutions.
the monopole ground state is then constructed as a combination of the zero-energy
eigenfunctions that are interpreted as fermionic collective coordinates describing a

grassmannian deformation of the original monopole. the generic solution of the
dirac equation can be written in the form

k =

nxi=1

ai
0k

0 i +

ajk
j ,

xj=1

(b.17)

where k
0 i are the zero-energy eigenfunctions. the coecients of the zero-energy
eigenfunctions in the expansion (b.17) become creation and annihilation operators

and zero-energy solitonic states are obtained by acting with such operators on the
bosonic monopole ground state. the number of fermionic zero-modes is determined
by an index theorem [71].

in the case of fermions in the fundamental representation it can be proved that
there is one zero-mode for each avor for a charge one monopole. rewriting the nf
dirac fermions in terms of 2nf weyl fermions one nds that the creation and anni-
hilation operators generate a cliord algebra of dimension 22nf /2 = 2nf , that splits
into two irreducible representations of dimension 2nf1. as a result the monopole
ground state is a spinor of so(2nf ). the angular momentum generator for a sym-
metric monopole is ~k = ~l + ~s + ~t , where ~t are the su(2)g generators of global
gauge transformations. fermions in the fundamental can have spin zero since they
transform under su(2)gso(3)r in the representation 2 2 = 1 + 3 which contains

206

appendix b. electric-magnetic duality

the singlet. hence the fermionic zero modes carry zero total angular momentum and

the resulting monopole congurations have spin zero.

if the fermions are in the adjoint representation there are two zero-modes for

each avor in the one-monopole background [71]. furthermore these zero modes
necessarily have ~k 6= 0 since the adjoint fermions transform in the 3  2 = 2 + 4
of su(2)gso(3)r. since the zero modes are two-fold degenerate they must carry
spin  1
2 . consequently in the simplest case of nf =1 the corresponding creation and
annihilation operators (that will be denoted by a
 and a) can be used to generate
the following multiplet of zero-energy states acting on the charge-one cliord vacuum

in conclusion the coupling to fermions in the adjoint representation gives a non-

vanishing spin to the monopole.
