ized intersecting bps branes in eleven and ten dimensions in the core region of
one type of constituent branes. we also give the brane worldvolume interpreta-
tions for some of such supergravity solutions.

1 introduction

over the past years, there has been active development in constructing classical su-
pergravity solutions of p-branes and other solitons in string theories. such classical
solutions in string theories made it possible to study quantum aspects of black holes
such as statistical interpretation of black hole entropy and absorption and decay rates
of black holes within the framework of string theories.
in such studies, black holes
are regarded as being obtained by wrapping (intersecting) higher-dimensional p-branes
around compact manifolds. in the course of compactifying p-branes, the supergrav-
ity solutions become delocalized along the compactied directions , which include
relative transverse directions (brane worldvolume directions which are transverse to
some of other constituent branes) and possibly some of overall transverse directions.
so, the corresponding intersecting p-brane solutions in higher-dimensions become lo-
calized only along the overall transverse directions. the most of intersecting brane
solutions that have been constructed are such delocalized type. for the purpose of
studying black hole physics in string theories, mostly it has been therefore sucient to
consider delocalized intersecting brane solutions.

in the recent ads/cft correspondence conjecture [1] and its generalisations (for
example [2, 3]), supergravity solutions in string theories play important roles. in this
conjecture, the decoupling limits of the worldvolume theories of brane congurations
are dual to the supergravity or superstring theories on the manifolds of the near horizon
geometry of the corresponding supergravity brane solutions. thereby, one can under-
stand gauge theories, which are the decoupling limits (where massive string modes,
the kaluza-klein (kk) modes and gravity modes decouple from the massless modes of
open strings) of the worldvolume theories of d-branes and other solitons, in terms of
the supergravity or superstring theories on the near horizon manifolds, and vice versa.
in the d-brane interpretation of gauge theories, the transverse locations of d-branes
are interpreted as moduli of the gauge theories. for example, transverse locations
of n numbers of d-branes, which are interpreted as scalar elds in the u(n) gauge
theories, parameterise the coulomb branch. when more than one types of branes in-
tersect, whereas locations of the light d-branes are dynamical moduli, locations of
the heavy branes become couplings, i.e. mass of quarks, since the kinetic energy of
their excitations is innite, thereby being frozen at their classical values.

therefore, in order to study gauge theories, which are boundary theories at innity of

when compactifying the supergravity solutions, one has to take an innite uniform array of branes
along the directions to be compactied in order to have an isometry necessary for the compactication.
also, by denition, compactication means the identication of the corresponding points in each cell
of the compactication lattice, thereby the branes are periodically distributed along the compacti-
ed directions. therefore, in the small size limit of the compactication manifold, the supergravity
solutions become delocalized along the compactied directions.

1

the ads/cft correspondence, in terms of supergravity in the bulk, the corresponding
supergravity solutions have to contain all the parameters, namely the locations of
the constituent branes along the transverse directions, of the gauge theory. however,
in delocalized intersecting p-brane solutions, location of constituent branes along the
worldvolume directions of the other branes is not specied, thereby not suitable for
studying gauge theories.

some attempts have been made to construct localized intersecting brane solutions
[4, 5, 6]. however, obtaining the explicit analytical form of localized solutions is
almost an impossible task, since harmonic functions  that specify constituent branes
now satisfy coupled partial dierential equations instead of the laplaces equations in
the at (overall) transverse space. solutions to such dierential equations in general
do not have simple explicit form in terms of elementary functions. so, although the
ansatz for the supergravity solutions for the localized bps intersecting branes has the
same form as the delocalized one with harmonic functions instead depending on the rel-
ative transverse coordinates as well, in general the explicit form of harmonic functions
cannot be found in closed form. in the case of localized intersecting non-extreme brane
solutions, even the general form of metric ansatz in terms of harmonic functions is
not known, not to mention the explicit expressions for harmonic functions. partially
localized intersecting brane solutions, where constituent branes are localized on the rel-
ative transverse directions but delocalized along the overall transverse directions, have
been constructed [7, 8, 9, 10]. however, these solutions satisfy dierent intersecting
rules from the ordinary intersecting branes and therefore they are not very useful for
studying gauge theories.

however, in some special cases in the near-core limit of one of constituent branes,
one can construct explicit solutions. the rst attempt was made in ref.[11], where the
use was made of the fact that the near-core limit or the large charge limit of the kk
monopole in d = 11 is m (6,1) times an an 1 singularity, which can be obtained from
the d = 11 at spacetime by the zn identication. after the dimensional reduction,
this an 1 singularity metric becomes either near-horizon limit of d6-branes or the kk
monopole in d = 10. since an an 1 singularity is ricci at (thereby satisfying the
einsteins equations), one can just replace the at transverse space of m-branes by an
an 1 singularity. after the compactication down to d = 10, the resulting solutions
are localized brane solutions in the core of either d6-branes or the kk monopoles. the
other type of localized intersecting brane solutions that were explicitly constructed is
the d(1)-brane solution in the core of d3-branes [12, 13, 14, 15]. in this case, it was
possible to obtain the explicit form of the harmonic function for d(1)-brane, since
harmonic function is dened as a solution f (xi) to the laplaces equation 1g i(ggijj)f (xi) =
0, where g  det(gij). but in the following we will continue to call the solutions to such coupled
dierential equations as harmonic functions.

2

the near-horizon geometry of d3-branes, i.e. ads5 space, is conformaly at.

one may argue that other localized intersecting bps brane solutions (in the core of
one of the constituents) can be obtained by just applying duality transformations on
the above localized solutions. however, in order to apply t -duality transformations in
the transverse directions , one has to rst compactify this direction, which becomes
delocalized through smearing or uniform array of branes along this direction. thereby,
the power of radial coordinate in the harmonic function (of the above d6-brane, kk
monopole and the d3-brane) changes. this implies that after the required delocaliza-
tion along the t -duality direction the near-horizon geometries of d6-brane and d = 10
kk monopole do not get uplifted to an an 1 singularity and the near-horizon geom-
etry of d3-branes is no longer conformaly at. so, the above tricks for constructing
localized intersecting branes cannot be applied. therefore, one has to construct such
localized intersecting bps brane solutions case by case. it is the purpose of this paper
to construct various explicit localized intersecting bps brane solutions in the core of
one of the constituents in various dimensions. we will apply simple coordinate trans-
formations to the dierential equations satised by the harmonic functions in order
to bring them to the forms of partial dierential equations which have known explicit
solutions.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we setup the general formalism for
constructing localized bps intersecting brane solutions. we will apply this formalism
to construct various explicit localized intersecting m-brane solutions in section 3, and
various localized intersecting brane solutions in ten dimensions in section 4.

2 general setup

in this section, we setup general formalism, which can be applied to any types of inter-
secting branes in any dimensions, for obtaining the explicit expressions for harmonic
functions.

in the bps case, localized intersecting branes satisfy the same harmonic superposi-
tion rules as the delocalized ones. generally, for intersecting two branes with overall
transverse coordinates ~z = (z1, . . . , zr), where the brane 1 (with the harmonic function
h1) has the relative transverse coordinates ~x = (x1, . . . , xp) and the brane 2 (with
the harmonic function h2) has the relative transverse coordinates ~y = (y1, . . . , yq), the
harmonic functions h1 = h1(~x, ~z) and h2 = h2(~y, ~z) satisfy the following coupled

the t -duality transformations on supergravity brane solutions along the longitudinal directions
are not allowed, since these transformations introduce additional transverse directions, which the re-
sulting transformed supergravity solutions have to depend on. one cannot arbitrarily let the solutions
depend on this new coordinates, as the satisfaction of the eld equations is not always guaranteed.

3

partial dierential equations [4, 5, 16, 11, 6]:

along with the constraint

2
~z h1 + h22
2
~z h2 + h12

~xh1 = 0,
~y h2 = 0,

~xh1~yh2 = 0.

(1)

(2)

the constraint (2), i.e. ~xh1 = 0 or ~yh2 = 0, implies that either (i) the two branes
are delocalized (localized only along the overall transverse directions) or (ii) while one
brane is completely localized the other brane has to be localized along the overall trans-
verse directions, only. since the delocalization of branes is interpreted as the uniform
distribution of the brane along the delocalized directions or the compactication of
those directions, the consistency of eld equations requires that at least one type of
the branes has to be uniformly distributed along the relative transverse directions (or
these directions are compactied) or coincide along these directions. this is not a dis-
advantageous situation for studying gauge theories, since the decoupling limit (where
only the massless modes of open strings, which describe gauge theories, survive) of the
brane worldvolume theories requires delocalization of some types of brane congura-
tions. for example, for the congurations where one type of branes suspends between
other type of branes, the distance between the latter type of branes has to approach
zero so that the associated massive kk modes on the worldvolume theory of the former
branes decouple from the massless open string modes. so, these directions, which are
the relative transverse directions of the former branes, become delocalized .

without loss of generality, for the sake of obtaining harmonic functions, we assume

that the brane 2 is delocalized:

2
~z h1 + h22

~xh1 = 0,

2
~z h2 = 0.

(3)

qi

(3) has the form h2 = 1 + pi

in general, the harmonic function h2 that satises the second dierential equation in
|~z~z0 i|r2 , where ~z0 i are locations of the i-th brane 2
with charge qi. however, in this paper we will consider the case in which the brane
2s coincide at the same location in the overall transverse ~z-directions. this is also
required as the decoupling limit of some types of brane congurations, as pointed out
in the previous paragraph. in this limit, one can neglect 1 in the harmonic function
h2. therefore, the harmonic function h2 takes the following form:

we assume here that the directions along which the latter type of branes stack are compactied

with the distance between the stack of the branes being the size of the compatication manifold.

h2 =

q
zr2 ,

(4)

4

where z  |~z  ~z0| and ~z0 is the location of the stack of q brane 2s. there might exist
solutions for the harmonic function h1 in the case where each brane 2s are located
at dierent points along the ~z-directions. however, it may not be possible to nd
expression for h1 in closed form in terms of elementary functions. furthermore, naive
inspection of the structure of the dierential equation satised by h1 seems to indicate
that there does not exist a localized solution for h1 where brane 1s are located at
arbitrary locations along the ~z-directions.

then, the rst dierential equation in (1) reduces to the following form:

q1z1z(zr1zh1) + 2

~xh1 = 0.

(5)

in the case where the harmonic function h1 depends on its relative transverse coordi-
nates ~x only through the radial coordinate x  |~x|, this dierential equation becomes
of the following form:

q1z1z(zr1zh1) + xp+1x(xp1xh1) = 0.

(6)

we will rst obtain solution h1 = h1(x, z) to the latter dierential equation. this
solution can be easily generalized as a general solution h2 = h2(~x, z) to the former
dierential equation (5).

the dierential equation (6) can be solved by transforming it to either of the follow-

ing forms:

[x a(xx ax) + y b(y y by )]f (x, y ) = 0,

[x a2

x + y b2

y ]g(x, y ) = 0,

(7)

(8)

where a and b are real numbers. for a localized brane, the corresponding harmonic
function has to be of the non-trivial form which is neither sum nor product of a func-
tion of x and a function of y k. such non-trivial solutions of the partial dierential
equations (7) and (8) are respectively given by

f (x, y ) = 1 +

(10)

kobtaining the solutions to the partial dierential equations (7) and (8) applying the method
of the additive or multiplicative separation of variables is very straightforward. however, when the
harmonic functions are of such forms, either the supergravity solution does not match onto a delta-
function brane source [5] or the point singularity of each term in the harmonic function represents the
brane that is delocalized in the other directions. the possibility of getting solutions with the additive
separation of variables were pointed out in ref.[17].

where the integration constants in the constant terms have been set to 1 so that the
harmonic functions take ordinary forms.

the dierential equation (6) can be put into the form (7) through the following

change of variables:

x  x = x,

z  y =

2q
|4  r|

4r

r ,

z

(11)

resulting in the form (7) with a = p  1 and b = r/(4  r). or the equation (6) can be
put into the form (8) by applying the following change of variables:

x  x =   x

2  p!2p

,

z  y = " q

(2  r)2#

2r
4r

z2r,

(12)

resulting in the form (8) with a = (2p  2)/(p  2) and b = r/(r  2). therefore,
the harmonic function h1 = h1(x, z) that satises the dierential equation (6) has the
form:

h1(x, z) = 1 +

.

(13)

note, when the dimension r of the overall transverse space with the coordinates
~z is 4, the coordinate transformations (11) and the expression (13) for the harmonic
function h1 are not valid . the only non-trivial solution, which is not a product of
a function of x and a function of z, to the dierential equation (6) with r = 4 that we
have found so far has the form:

h1(x, z) = 1 + p (x2  pq ln z),

(14)

although this looks quite extraordinary as a harmonic function associated with (local-
ized) branes and this implies that the associated brane is delocalized. however, when
the solution is smeared in one of the overall transverse directions ~z, one can nd more
acceptable expression for the harmonic function h1 from eq.(13) (with r = 3), just
as in ref.[11], which represents brane 1s that are completely localized except for one
delocalized overall transverse direction.

also, for some other intersecting brane congurations to be discussed in the following
sections, we note that the corresponding supergravity solutions become delocalized
since the power in the harmonic function h1 is positive instead of negative.
if one
delocalizes of some of the overall transverse directions, the power in the harmonic
function h1 becomes negative, thereby describing the brane 1 that are completely
localized except for the delocalized overall transverse directions. this seems to imply
that, if there do not exist other class of localized solutions (where the brane 1 and

and of course, when r = 2, the solution (13) and the transformations (11) and (12) are not valid,

since the harmonic function h2 is no longer of the form (4) but is logarithmic.

the brane 2 meet in the overall transverse space), the corresponding microscopic brane
congurations have to be delocalized in the relative transverse directions unless some
of the overall transverse directions are delocalized.

it can be proved that the original dierential equation (5) for the harmonic function

h1 = h1(~x, ~z) is solved by

h1(~x, ~z) = 1 +xi

(15)

where the i-th brane 1 with charge pi is located at (~x, ~z) = (~x0 i, ~z0).

when more than two branes intersect, one can apply the above procedure with cou-
pled dierential equations with constraints that generalize (1) and (2). (for example,
see ref.[16].) for such general cases, one may have to transform the coupled partial
dierential equations to one of the following forms:

[xi

respectively given by

in the following sections, we will present the explicit forms of every possible intersect-
ing brane solutions in eleven and ten dimensions. localized intersecting brane solutions
in other dimensions can be similarly constructed just by applying the procedure dis-
cussed in this section. all the possible delocalized intersecting brane congurations
are studied in refs.[18, 19], which we generalize to the localized case. in the following,
we will just write down expressions for spacetime metric and the explicit forms of har-
monic functions, since the expressions for other elds (dilaton and form elds) can be
straightforwardly constructed by applying the same harmonic function superposition
rules as the delocalized intersecting brane cases but now with new localized harmonic
functions replaced.

3 localized intersecting m -branes

in eleven dimensions, the basic constituents of intersecting branes are m2- and m5-
branes, which respectively carry electric and magnetic charges of the three-form eld,

7

the kk monopole and the pp-wave. in the following, we write down the spacetime
metrics for all the possible combinations of intersecting pairs of these branes along
with the explicit forms of the harmonic functions.

3.1

intersecting m2- and m5-branes

there are 4 overall transverse directions (r = 4). the m2-branes have 4 relative
transverse directions (p = 4), and the m5-branes have 1 relative transverse direction
(q = 1). since this conguration is interpreted as m2-branes ending on m5-branes,
it is natural to let the solution be delocalized along the relative transverse direction
of the m5-branes. formally, one can however construct solution for the other case, as
well. the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

11 = h 1/3
+h 1

2 h 2/3

5

[(h2h5)1(dt2 + dw2) + h 1

2 dy2 + dz2

1 + . . . + dz2
4],

5 (dx2

1 + . . . + dx2
4)

(20)

where the harmonic functions h2 and h5 are respectively associated with the m2- and
m5-branes. for the purpose of obtaining more physically acceptable form of solution,
we delocalize the solution along one of the overall transverse directions ~z . then, the
harmonic functions are given by

h2 = 1 +xi

qi

(|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4p|~z  ~z0|)3 , h5 =

p

|~z  ~z0|

.

(21)

the eective worldvolume theory of the m5-brane is the 5 + 1 dimensional (2, 0)
tensor multiplet containing 5 scalars, an anti-symmetric tensor with self-dual 3-form
eld strength, and 4 chiral fermions. the ends of m2-branes on the m5-branes are
regarded as (self-dual) strings (in the m5-brane worldvolume theory) charged under
this tensor. the charges qi and locations ~x0 i in the above supergravity solution are
related to charges and locations of these strings in the worldvolume theory.

3.2

intersecting two m5-branes

there are 3 overall transverse directions (r = 3) and 2 relative transverse directions
for each m5-brane (p = 2 = q). so, in the core region of one of the m5-branes, the
metric has the following form:

ds2

11 = (h1h2)2/3[(h1h2)1(dt2 + dw2

+h 1

2 (dx2

1 + dx2

2) + h 1

1 (dy2

1 + dy2

2) + dz2

1 + dw2

2 + dw2
3)
1 + dz2

2 + dz2
3],

(22)

when the solution is completely localized along all the overall transverse directions, the harmonic

function takes an unacceptable form (14) with a logarithm

8

with the harmonic functions given by:

h1 = 1 +xi

pi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4p|~z  ~z0|]2 , h2 =

p

|~z  ~z0|

.

(23)

from the perspective of m5-brane worldvolume theory, the 3-dimensional intersec-
tion is 1/2 supersymmetric 3-branes that carry the self-dual 3-form central charges of
the worldvolume superalgebra of the m5-brane [20]. the parameters pi and ~x0 i are
related to the charges and the locations of these 3-branes in the m5-brane worldvolume
theory.

3.3

intersecting two m2-branes

in this case, there are 6 overall transverse directions (r = 6) and the dimensions of the
relative transverse spaces of both of m2-branes are 2 (p = 2 = q). in the core region
of one of the m2-branes, the solution has the following form:

ds2

11 = h 1/3

2 (dx2

1 + dx2

2) + h 1

1 (dy2

1 + dy2
2)

1 h 1/3
+dz2

2

[h 1
1 h 1
2 dt2 + h 1
1 + . . . + dz2
6],

where the harmonic functions are given by

h1 = 1 +xi

qi[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + q|~z  ~z0|2], h2 =

q

|~z  ~z0|4 .

(24)

(25)

when n of the overall transverse directions are delocalized, the harmonic functions
take the following form:

h1 = 1 +xi

qi
[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q

(n2)2|~z  ~z0|n2]

, h2 =

2

n2

q

|~z  ~z0|4n .

(26)

so, when 3 overall transverse directions are delocalized, the harmonic function h1, as
well as h2, takes a standard form where branes are localized except for the 3 delocalized
overall transverse directions.

from the perspective of the m2-brane worldvolume theory, the 0 + 1 dimensional
intersection is interpreted as a 0-brane coupled to the zero form central charge in the
worldvolume superalgebra. the parameters ~x0 i and qi are related to the locations and
charges of these worldvolume 0-branes.

3.4 m2-brane with the kk monopole

when the at transverse space of the m2-brane is replaced by the taub-nut terms
of the kk monopole, the spacetime metric takes the following form:

ds2

11 = h 2/3

2

[dt2 + dw2

1 + dw2

2] + h 1/3

2

[dx2

1 + . . . + dx2
4

9

+hk(dz2

1 + dz2

2 + dz2

3) + h 1

k (dy + aidzi)2],

(27)

where the harmonic functions h2 and hk for the m2-brane and the kk monopole and
a 1-form potential a = (ai) satisfy the equations:

2
~z hk = 0,

zihk = ijkzj ak,

2
~z h2 + hk2

~xh2 = 0.

(28)

in the core region of the kk monopole or in the limit of large kk monopole charge,
the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

hk =

qkk
|~z  ~z0|
h2 = 1 +xi

, a = qkk cos d,

qi

(|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4qkk|~z  ~z0|)3 .

(29)

this solution reproduces the one in ref.[11].

the 0-form central charges of the m2-brane worldvolume superalgebra are equivalent
to the space components of the dual 2-forms, which are carried by a worldvolume 2-
branes. this 2-brane is interpreted as the intersection of the m2-brane with the kk
monopole [20].

3.5 m5-brane with the kk monopole

when the at transverse space of the m5-brane is replaced by the taub-nut terms
of the kk monopole, the spacetime metric takes the following form:

ds2

11 = h 1/3

5

[dt2 + dw2

1 + dz2

1 + . . . + dw2
3) + h 1

2 + dz2

+hk(dz2

5] + h 2/3

5

[dx2

k (dy + aidzi)2],

(30)

where the harmonic functions h5 and hk for the m5-branes and the kk monopole
and a 1-form potential a = (ai) satisfy the equations:

2
~z hk = 0,

zihk = ijkzj ak,

2
~z h5 + hk2

xh5 = 0.

(31)

in the core region of the kk monopole or in the limit of large kk monopole charge,
the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

hk =

qkk
|~z  ~z0|
h5 = 1 +xi

, a = qkk cos d,

pi

(|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4qkk|~z  ~z0|)3/2 .

(32)

this solution is also constructed in ref.[11].

the time component of the 1-form central charge in the m5-brane worldvolume su-
peralgebra can be viewed as the space components of a worldvolume dual 5-form. this
charge is carried by the kk monopole [20]. therefore, this conguration is interpreted
as the m5-brane inside of the kk monopole [21, 22].

10

3.6 the pp wave in the background of m2-branes

for the pp wave which travels along one of the worldvolume directions, which we choose
to be w, of the m2-brane, the metric takes the following form:

ds2

11 = h 2/3

2

[dt2 + dw2 + dx2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2]
+h 1/3

1 + . . . + dz2

(dz2

8),

2

(33)

with the harmonic functions h2 and hw for the m2-brane and the pp wave satisfying
the following equations:

2
~z h2 = 0,

2
~z hw + h22

xhw = 0.

(34)

in the core region of the m2-brane, the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

q

h2 =

|~z  ~z0|6 , hw = 1 + qw (x2 +

q

1

|~z  ~z0|4 ).

(35)

when n of the overall transverse directions are delocalized, the harmonic functions
take the following forms:

so, with 5 of the overall transverse directions delocalized the solutions become localized
except for these delocalized overall transverse directions.

upon dimensional reduction to d = 10, the d = 11 pp-wave becomes d0-brane in
the type-iia theory. the 0-form central charges in the d = 11 pp-wave superalgebra
are decomposed into two sets of the 0-form central charges in the d = 10 d0-brane
superalgebra, which can be respectively interpreted in the transverse 9-space as the
central charges carried by a d4-brane or the kk monopole and a fundamental string
or a d8-branes [20]. when uplifted to d = 11, the resulting congurations are m2- and
m5-brane and the kk monopole involving the pp-wave, whose supergravity solutions
are presented in this section and the following sections. on the other hand, the 3-
momentum in the m2-brane superalgebra, interpreted as a 0-form in the transverse
8-space, is the null 3-momentum of the pp-wave inside the m2-brane [20]. similarly, the
5-momentum in the m5-brane superalgebra, interpreted as a 0-form in the transverse
5-space, is the null 5-momentum of the d = 11 pp-wave inside of the m5-brane, whose
supergravity solution is given in the next subsection.

3.7 the pp-wave in the background of m5-branes

for the pp wave which travels along one of the worldvolume directions, which we choose
to be w, of the m5-brane, the metric takes the following form:

ds2

11 = h 1/3

5

[dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2 + dx2

1 + . . . + dx2

(37)

with the harmonic functions h5 and hw for the m5-brane and the pp wave satisfying
the following equations:

2
~z h5 = 0,

2
~z hw + h52

~xhw = 0.

(38)

in the core region of the m5-brane, the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

p

h5 =

|~z  ~z0|3 , hw = 1 + qw (x2 +

4p

|~z  ~z0|

).

(39)

when n of the overall transverse directions are delocalized, the harmonic functions
take the following forms:

h5 =

p

|~z  ~z0|3n , hw = 1 +

qw

[x2 + 4p

(n1)2|~z  ~z0|n1]

.

(40)

so, with 2 of the overall transverse directions delocalized, the solutions become localized
except for these two delocalized overall transverse directions.

3.8 the pp-wave in the background of the kk monopole

the spacetime metric for the pp wave which propagates in the background of the kk
monopole has the following form:

ds2

11 = dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2 + dx2

(41)

where the harmonic functions hk and hw for the kk monopole and the pp wave and
a 1-form potential a = (ai) satisfy the equations:

2
~z hk = 0,

zihk = ijkzj ak,

2
~z hw + hk2

~xhw = 0.

(42)

in the core region of the kk monopole or in the limit of large kk monopole charge,
the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

qkk

hk =

hw = 1 +

4 intersecting branes in ten dimensions

in ten dimensions, the basic constituents of intersecting branes are d-branes, funda-
mental string, solitonic ns5-brane, the kk monopole and the pp wave. in the follow-
ing, we present intersecting brane congurations of all the possible combinations.

4.1 two dp-branes self-intersecting over (p  2) dimensions
in this case, the overall transverse space has 7  p dimensions and there are 2 relative
transverse directions for both of dp-branes. the spacetime metric has the following
form:

(44)

where the harmonic functions h1 and h2 for each dp-branes satisfy the following
equations:

the harmonic functions are therefore given by

2
~z h1 + h22

~xh1 = 0,

2
~z h2 = 0.

h1 = 1 +xi

(45)

(46)

note, for p = 2, this solution becomes delocalized. so, one has to delocalize some
of the overall transverse directions to obtain supergravity solution representing the
intersecting brane localized except for the delocalized overall transverse directions.
when the overall transverse space is 4-dimensional, i.e. self-intersecting d3-branes,
the above expression for the harmonic function h1 is singular. in this case, one has
to delocalize one of the overall transverse directions. with two [one] overall transverse
directions are delocalized for p = 2 [for p = 3], the harmonic functions are given by:

h1 = 1 +xi

qi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|]2 , h2 =

|~z  ~z0|

(47)

the dp-brane worldvolume theory contains a scalar (interpreted as a goldstone
mode of spontaneously broken translational invariance by the dp-brane), which is
hodge-dualized to a worldvolume (p1)-form potential that the (p2)-brane (common
intersection of the two dp-branes) couples to.

4.2 dp-branes ending on d(p + 2)-branes

there are 6 p overall transverse directions. the dimensions of the relative transverse
space are 3 for dp-branes and 1 for d(p + 2)-branes. since dp-branes stretch between
d(p+2)-branes, it is natural to let d(p+2)-branes to be delocalized along their relative
transverse direction. the spacetime metric is given by

~z hp + hp+22

2
~z hp+2 = 0.

the harmonic functions are given by

(50)

the uctuations of locations ~x0 i of the dp-branes along the d(p + 2)-brane di-
rections, together with the y-component of the dp-worldvolume gauge eld, forms a
massless hypermultiplet with free boundary conditions at y = 0. the scalars describing
the uctuations of location ~z0 of the dp-branes along the directions perpendicular to
the d(p + 4)-branes, together with the t- and ~w-components of the dp-worldvolume
gauge eld, form a vectormultiplet with each component eld satisfying the dirichlet
boundary conditions.

from the point of view of the d(p+2)-branes, the ends of the dp-branes are charged
objects in the d(p+2)-brane worldvolume. for d1-branes ending on d3-branes (p = 1
case), the ends of the d1-branes are magnetic sources for the d3-brane worldvolume
gauge elds. therefore, the worldvolume theory is the magnetic monopoles in the 4-
dimensional u(q) yang-mills theory. the locations ~x = ~x0 i of the d1-branes along the

directions of the d3-branes, together with the wilson lines of the pi qi u(1) world-

volume gauge elds of d1-branes along the y-direction, parameterize the monopole
moduli space. the charges qi of the d1-branes are interpreted as magnetic charges
of the monopoles. under the s-duality of the type-iib theory, this supergravity brane
solution transforms to the supergravity solution for fundamental strings ending on
d3-branes, which is presented in the following subsection. from the d3-brane world-
volume point of view, this s-duality is the montonen-olives strong-weak coupling
electric-magnetic duality of the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory in 4 dimensions. the
ends of the fundamental strings on the d3-branes are electric charge sources, inter-
preted as charged gauge bosons. just as the d1-brane and the fundamental string
form a multiplet under the type-iib s-duality, the charged gauge boson and the mag-
netic monopole transform as a multiplet under the montonen-olive duality.

when p = 1, the above harmonic function hp represents delocalized dp-branes,
thereby requiring delocalization of some of overall transverse directions. when p = 2,
the overall transverse space is 4-dimensional. so, one of the overall transverse directions
has to be delocalized. with two [one] of the overall transverse directions delocalized
for the p = 1 [p = 2] case, harmonic functions are given by:

hp = 1 +xi

4.3 dp-branes inside of the worldvolume of d(p + 4)-branes

there are 5  p overall transverse directions. the dimensionalities of the relative
transverse spaces are 4 for dp-branes and 0 for d(p + 4)-branes. the spacetime metric
has the following form:

ds2

where the harmonic functions hp and hp+4 for dp- and d(p + 4)-branes satisfy the
dierential equations:

2
~z hp + hp+42

~xhp = 0,

2
~z hp+4 = 0.

the harmonic functions are therefore given by

(54)

the decoupling limit of the worldvolume theory of the corresponding microscopic d-

d(p + 4)-branes being a global symmetry from the point of view of dp-branes, or (ii)

brane conguration is (i) the (p + 1)-dimensional u(pi qi) gauge theory with q avors
(in the fundamental representation of u(pi qi)) with the u(q) gauge symmetry of the
small u(q) instantons from the point of view of d(p + 4)-branes with pi qi dp-branes

being pointlike defects in the fundamental of u(q). from the point of view of the
worldvolume theory of the dp-branes, the locations of the branes are interpreted as
follows. the locations of the d(p + 4)-branes relative to the locations of dp-branes
in the ~z-direction are masses ~mj (j = 1, . . . , q) for the q-fundamentals. since all the
d(p + 4)-branes coincide in the above supergravity solution, the full u(q) symmetry is
left intact, while the quarks in the fundamental of u(q) remain massless. the locations
~x0 i of dp-branes parallel to the d(p + 4)-branes correspond to expectation values of an

~z transverse to the d(p + 4)-branes at ~z = ~z0 (parameterizing the coulomb branch

adjoint hypermultiplet of u(pi qi). since all the dp-branes coincide in the direction
of the u(pi qi) gauge theory) for the above supergravity solution, the full u(pi qi)

gauge symmetry is left unbroken.

in the case of p = 3, i.e.

intersecting d3- and d7-branes, one has to include the
orientifold 7 plane with 8 units of d7-brane charge in order to cancel the brane charges.
then, the d3- and d7-branes have to located in pairs as mirror images of the orientifold
plane along the ~z-directions. note, the ground state of an open string that stretches
between the same d3-brane is the neutral gauge boson w 3
 , whereas those that stretch
between a pair of d3-brane and its mirror image are the charged gauge bosons w 
 .

15

since all the d3-branes in the above supergravity solution  coincide in the ~z-direction,
these charged gauge bosons are massless and therefore the full su(2) gauge symmetry
on the worldvolume of d3-branes is left unbroken. since the relative locations of
d7-branes and their mirror images with respect to d3-brane locations along the ~z-
direction is zero, the quarks are massless and the so(8) symmetry on the worldvolume
of d7-branes remains unbroken.

the p = 2 case is the supergravity solutions for d2-branes within d6-branes con-
structed in ref.[11]. the above solution becomes singular for p = 1 and delocalized for
p = 0. after one [two] of the overall transverse directions are delocalized for p = 1 [for
p = 0], the harmonic functions take the following forms:

hp = 1 +xi

qi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|]3 , hp+4 =

q

|~z  ~z0|

.

(55)

one can also obtain the localized bps solution for d(1)-branes in the background
of d3-branes (the p = 1 case) applying the the general formalism in section 2,
although the harmonic function for the d(1)-brane is shown to satisfy the laplaces
equation in the ads5 space. after the wick rotation to the euclidean time coordinate
x0   , the spacetime metric takes the following form:

ds2

10 = h 1/2

1 h 1/2

3

(dx2

0 + . . . + dx2

3) + (h1h3)1/2(dz2

1 + . . . + dz2

6),

(56)

and the dilaton and the 0-form eld in the rr sector are respectively given by e = h1
and (  ) = (e  e). here, the subscript  denotes the value of a eld at
the ads5 boundary. the harmonic functions h1 and h3 for the d(1)-branes and
d3-branes satisfy the following equations:

2
~z h1 + h32

~xh1 = 0,

2
~z h3 = 0,

(57)

where ~x = (x0, . . . , x3) now the time coordinate x0 =  included. this system of partial
dierential equations cannot be solved by applying the method discussed in section 2.
but it can be easily proved that the following harmonic functions satisfy (57):

h1 = 1 +xi

qi|~z  ~z0|4

[|~x  ~x0 i|2|~z  ~z0|2 + q]4 , h3 =

q

|~z  ~z0|4 .

(58)

this is the solution constructed in ref.[14], where the radial coordinate z = |~z 
~z0| in (58) is the inverse of that in their solution. the worldvolume theory of the
when p = 3, the harmonic function h7 for the d7-branes has to be logarithmic. therefore, the
solution (54) is not valid and one cannot obtain the explicit expression for the harmonic functions
applying the method discussed in section 2. however, there might exist the explicit expressions for
harmonic functions where all the d-branes coincide in the ~z-direction. on the other hand, such
supergravity solution cannot be trusted since the conservation of brane charges requires that there
can be only 4 d3-branes and 4 d7-branes.

16

corresponding microscopic d-brane conguration is the multi-yang-mills instantons in
the 4-dimensional u(q) gauge theory with the instanton with the instanton number
qi located at ~x = ~x0 i. since the d(1)-brane is located at the position where the
d3-branes coincide, the size of the yang-mills instantons is innite [23].

4.4 fundamental strings ending on dp-branes

there are 8  p overall transverse directions. the fundamental strings have p relative
transverse directions and the dp-branes have 1 relative transverse direction.
it is
natural to let the solution to be delocalized along the relative transverse direction of
the dp-branes. the spacetime metric has the following form:

(59)

where the harmonic functions hf and hp for the fundamental string and dp-branes
satisfy the equations:

the harmonic functions are therefore given by

2
~z hf + hp2

~xhf = 0,

2
~z hp = 0.

(60)

(61)

note that for p < 4 the above solution becomes delocalized and for p = 4 the solution
becomes singular. after 5p overall transverse directions are delocalized, the harmonic
functions take the following forms:

hf = 1 +xi

qi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|]3 , hp =

(62)

representing fundamental strings localized except for the delocalized 5p overall trans-
verse directions.

for p = 3, this supergravity solution is s-dual to the d-strings ending on d3-branes
discussed in the previous section. once again, the ends of the fundamental strings are
interpreted as (electrically) charged gauge bosons in the worldvolume gauge theory of
the d3-branes.

4.5 dp-branes ending on n s5-branes

there are 3 overall transverse directions. the dimensions of the relative transverse
spaces are 6  p for dp-branes and 1 for ns5-branes. it is natural to delocalize in

17

the direction relatively transverse to the ns5-branes. the spacetime metric for the
dp-branes (p  6) ending on ns5-branes is given by

ds2

10 = h 1/2

where the harmonic functions hp and hn s for the dp-branes and ns5-branes satisfy
the equations:

(63)

(64)

(65)

~xhp = 0,
the harmonic functions are therefore given by

2
~z hp + hn s2

~z hn s = 0.

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|]

qi

, hn s =

2

q

|~z  ~z0|

.

the p = 6 case is the supergravity solution for ns5-branes within d6-branes con-
structed in ref.[11].

since the y-direction, in which the ns5-branes stack, is delocalized, one can think
of the ns5-branes as being periodically arrayed in the y-direction with the periodic-
ity given by the circumference of the compactication circle. the scalars describing
the uctuations of the location ~z = ~z0 of the dp-branes in the perpendicular direc-
tions to the ns5-branes, along with the y-component of the dp-worldvolume gauge
eld, form the hypermultiplet. the scalars corresponding to the locations ~x = ~x0 i of
the dp-branes in the parallel directions of the ns5-branes, together with the t- and
~x-components of the dp-worldvolume gauge eld, form the vector multiplet. since
the dp-branes are nite in y, the worldvolume gauge theory is eectively 1 + (p  1)
dimensional with the kaluza-klein excitations on the dp-branes invisible at large dis-
tances. for p = 3, 4, the corresponding worldvolume theory is 1 + (p  1) dimensional
qq5
i=1 u(q4) supersymmetric gauge theory with q5 (bifundamental) hypermultiplets
transforming in the (q4, q4) of u(q4)  u(q4). here, each u(q4) gauge group is
associated with q4 dp-branes that stretch between two adjacent ns5-branes.

4.6 fundamental strings with n s5-branes

for fundamental strings parallel to ns5-branes, there are 4 overall transverse direc-
tions. so, the delocalization along one of the overall transverse directions is required.
the fundamental strings have 4 relative transverse directions and the ns5-branes have
no relative transverse direction. the metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = h 1

f (dt2 + dw2) + dx2

1 +    + dx2

4 + hn s(dz2

1 +    + dz2
4),

(66)

where the harmonic functions hf and hn s for the fundamental strings and the ns5-
branes satisfy

2
~z hf + hn s2

~xhf = 0,

2
~z hn s = 0.

(67)

18

the harmonic functions are therefore given by

hf = 1 +xi

qi

[|~x  ~x0 i|2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|]3 , hn s =

q

|~z  ~z0|

.

(68)

this solution is also constructed in ref.[11].

4.7 two n s5-branes intersecting over 3 dimensions

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = dt2 + dw2

where the harmonic functions h1 and h2 for each ns5-branes satisfy:

2
~z h1 + h22

~xh1 = 0,

2
~z h2 = 0.

(69)

(70)

the overall transverse space is 2-dimensional. this means that the harmonic function
h2 in eq.(4) has to be logarithmic. so, one cannot construct the localized solution by
applying the method developed in this paper.

the target manifold including an ale space with aqkk 1 singularity.

the spacetime metric has the following form:

where hn s and hk are the harmonic functions for the ns5-branes and the kk
monopole and a = (ai) is a 1-form potential. there are no relative transverse di-
rections. so, there is no point in considering the localized intersecting conguration.

4.11 the pp wave propagating in the background of the kk

monopole

and the pp wave. since there is no relative transverse directions, it is of no point to
discuss the special localized solution.

4.13 n s5-brane with the pp wave propagating along one of

its longitudinal directions

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2 + dx2

1 + . . . + dx2

+hn s(dz2

1 + . . . + dz2

(82)

with the harmonic functions hn s and hw for the ns5-brane and the pp wave satis-
fying the following equations:

2
~z hn s = 0,

2
~z hw + hn s2

~xhw = 0.

(83)

in the core region of the ns5-brane with one of its overall transverse directions delo-
calized, the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

hn s =

p

|~z  ~z0|

, hw = 1 +

qw

(x2 + 4p|~z  ~z0|)3 .

4.14 dp-brane with the pp wave propagating along one of its

longitudinal directions

the spacetime metric has the following form:

ds2

10 = h 1/2

p

[dt2 + dw2 + (hw  1)(dt  dw)2 + dx2
+h 1/2

1 + . . . + dz2

(85)

with the harmonic functions hp and hw for the dp-brane and the pp wave satisfying
the following equations:

2
~z hp = 0,

2
~z hw + hp2

~xhw = 0.

(86)

in the core region of the dp-branes, the harmonic functions are therefore given by:

hp =

q

|~z  ~z0|7p , hw = 1 +

qw

(x2 + 4q

(p5)2|~z  ~z0|p5)

.

p28p+19

(87)

for the p < 5 the pp wave becomes delocalized and for p = 5 the above solution
becomes singular. after 6  p of the overall transverse directions are delocalized, the
harmonic functions take the following forms:

hp =

q

|~z  ~z0|

, hw = 1 +

qw

(x2 + 4q|~z  ~z0|)3 .

(88)

the p = 6 case is the supergravity solution for the pp wave localized within d6-branes
constructed in ref.[11].
