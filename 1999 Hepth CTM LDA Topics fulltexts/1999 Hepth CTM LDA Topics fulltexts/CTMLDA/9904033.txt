supposed establish equivalence two (seemingly dierent) full string theories, case duality transformations map weak coupling regions one theory strong coupling regions one vice versa. thus e.g. exchange elementary excitations solitonic p-branes. several dierent kinds non perturbative dualities distinguished: 1.3.1 s-duality s-duality mean selfduality, maps weak coupling regime one string

two dierent string theories way perturbative expansions get mixed up. perturbative regime one theory equivalent non perturbative regime one. elementary excitations one side mapped solitonic objects
