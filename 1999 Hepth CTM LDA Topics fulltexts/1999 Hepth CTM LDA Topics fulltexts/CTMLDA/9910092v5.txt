abstract

we study the thermodynamics of the large n noncommutative super
yang-mills theory in the strong t hooft coupling limit in the spirit of
ads/cft correspondence. it has already been noticed that some thermo-
dynamic quantities of near-extremal d3-branes with ns b elds, which are
dual gravity congurations of the noncommutative n =4 super yang-mills
theory, are the same as those without b elds. in this paper, (1) we examine
the 3r4 corrections to the free energy and nd that the part of the tree-level
contribution remains unchanged, but the one-loop and the non-perturbative
d-instanton corrections are suppressed, compared to the ordinary case. (2)
we consider the thermodynamics of a bound state probe consisting of d3-
branes and d-strings in the near-extremal d3-brane background with b eld,
and nd the thermodynamics of the probe is the same as that of a d3-brane
probe in the d3-brane background without b eld.
(3) the stress-energy
tensor of the noncommutative super yang-mills theory is calculated via the
ads/cft correspondence. it is found that the tensor is not isotropic and its
trace does not vanish, which conrms that the super yang-mills is not con-
formal even in four dimensions due to the noncommutative nature of space.
our results render further evidence for the argument that the large n non-
commutative and ordinary super yang-mills theories are equivalent not only
in the weak coupling limit, but also in the strong coupling limit.

i. introduction

the super yang-mills theory (sym) on noncommutative spaces is a natural generaliza-
tion of the sym on the ordinary commutative spaces. such a noncommutative sym has
been found to arise naturally in a certain limit of string theory with ns b elds [16]. the
spirit of the ads/cft correspondence [710] leads one to try to nd out the supergravity
dual of the noncommutative sym. recently hashimoto and itzhaki [11], and maldacena
and russo [12] constructed independently the supergravity dual congurations of the non-
commutative syms, which are the decoupling limits of d-brane solutions with ns b elds.
some of the latter have been also constructed in [1315] before 1. the supergravity dual
of the noncommutative sym can also be constructed by using the relationship between the
open string moduli and closed string moduli [17]. in this construction, the only input is a
simple form of the running string tension as a function of energy.

in the ads/cft correspondence, of particular interest is the d3-brane solution.

its
decoupling limit has the structure ads5  s5, and the type iib string theory on this back-
ground is supposed to be dual to the four-dimensional n =4 sym in the large n and strong
t hooft coupling limit. at nite temperature the theory is described by the near-extremal
d3-brane conguration [7,18]. according to the ads/cft correspondence, the decoupling
limit of d3-brane solutions with b elds is supposed to be the dual gravity description of
the noncommutative sym in four dimensions [11,12]. an interesting question then arises:
are the total numbers of degrees of freedom the same for the noncommutative and ordinary
syms at any given scale? on the weak t hooft coupling side, according to the analysis of
planar diagrams [19], the large n noncommutative and ordinary syms are equivalent; the
planar diagrams depends on the non-commutativity parameter only through the external
momenta and the noncommutative eects can be seen in the non-planar diagrams. explicit
perturbative calculations [20] provide evidence to this assertion. on the strong t hooft cou-
pling side, maldacena and russo [12] have discussed the thermodynamics of near-extremal
d3-branes with b elds and found that the entropy and other thermodynamic quantities
are the same as those of the corresponding d3-branes without b elds 2. on this basis, they
argued that the total number of physical degrees of freedom of the noncommutative sym
at any given scale coincides with the ordinary case.

in the present paper we would like to investigate further aspects of thermodynamics
of the noncommutative sym from the supergravity side and to compare them with the
ordinary sym cases. in section ii, we introduce the black d3-brane solutions with ns b
elds and calculate some of their thermodynamic quantities. most of the results are known,
but these are needed for our discussions. this also serves to establish our notation.
in
section iii we calculate the corrections from the higher derivative terms (3r4) to the free
energy of the noncommutative sym. to compare the results with the ordinary case, we use
a t-duality transformation to transform the d3-brane solution with b eld and a varying

1these and more general solutions are also discussed in [16] in iia, iib and d = 11 supergravities.

2this conclusion also holds for other d-branes with b elds. for related discussions see refs.

dilaton to that with constant dilaton and b elds. in the latter conguration, we nd that
the contribution coming from the tree-level term remains the same as that in the ordinary
case, but the contributions from the one-loop and non-perturbative d-instanton terms are
suppressed. this result is consistent with that in the weak coupling limit [19].

in section iv we consider the thermodynamics of a static bound state probe consisting
of d3-branes and d-strings in the background produced by near-extremal d3-branes with
b eld. according to the interpretation of the d-brane action, the supergravity interaction
potential between the probe and the source d-branes can be interpreted as the contribution
of massive states to the free energy of sym when the sym is in the higgs phase, and the
distance between the probe and the source can be regarded as a mass scale of the sym. we
nd that the thermodynamics of the bound state probe again remains the same as that of
a d3-brane probe in the near-extremal d3-brane background without b eld. in section v,
we compute the stress-energy tensor of the noncommutative sym on the supergravity side.
as is already known, the thermal excitations of d3-branes without b elds are of the form of
an ideal gas in four dimensions. the entropy of near-extremal d3-branes can be accounted
for by the ideal gas model [24]; its stress-energy tensor is isotropic and its trace vanishes [25],
which conrms that the sym is conformally invariant in four dimensions. our result shows
that the stress-energy tensor of the noncommutative sym is not isotropic and its trace does
not vanish, which reects the fact that the noncommutative sym is not conformal even in
four dimensions. section vi is devoted to the summary of our results and discussions.

ii. the black d3-brane solution with b field and its

thermodynamics

the supergravity solution corresponding to d3-branes with a non-vanishing ns b eld
has been constructed in [13] and [15]. the simplest way to get the solution is to start
with a d3-brane solution without b eld. first make t-duality along x3 (the world-volume
coordinates are x0, x1, x2 and x3), which gives a d2-brane solution with a smeared coordinate
x3, perform a rotation with an angle  in the x2-x3 plane and then t-dualize back on x3.
this procedure yields the desired solution with a non-vanishing b eld along x2 and x3
directions [12]. the prescription is also applicable to the black d3-brane solutions. the
black d3-brane solution with b eld along x2 and x3 directions can be written in the string
metric as

ds2 = h 1/2[f dx2

0 + dx2

1 + h(dx2

2 + dx2

fact the solution describes a non-threshold bound state consisting of d3-branes and d-strings
due to the presence of the nonzero b eld [15].

ymn3   is
let us rst discuss the extremal case f = 1 in the solution (2.4). the solution (2.4)
reduces to the familiar product spacetime ads5  s5 for a = 0, while it deviates from the
anti-de sitter space for a 6= 0. thus, in the spirit of ads/cft correspondence the solution
(2.4) is proposed to be the gravity dual of the noncommutative sym and the parameter a
reects the noncommutative nature of space. when u  0, the solution (2.4) approaches
the ads5s5, which corresponds to the ir regime of the gauge theory. this is in agreement
with the expectation that the noncommutative sym reduces to the ordinary sym at long
distances.

next, for non-extremal solution (2.4), just like the pure black d3-brane case, the ther-
modynamics of the non-extremal solution (2.4) should be equivalent to that of the noncom-
mutative sym in the large n and strong t hooft coupling limit. however, the solution
(2.4) is neither asymptotically at nor asymptotically anti-de sitter. hence it is dicult
to calculate the energy excitation of the noncommutative sym directly from the solution
(2.4). to discuss the thermodynamics of the noncommutative theory, we rather start with
the black d3-brane solution (2.1). for our purpose, it is convenient to rewrite the solution
in the einstein frame, which has the following form:

ds2

e = h1/4h 1/2[f dx2

0 + dx2

1 + h(dx2

2 + dx2

3)] + h1/4h 1/2[f 1dr2 + r2d2
5].

(2.6)

we can further make compactication of the d3-brane world-volume and then go to the
einstein frame. from the resulting metric, we can easily obtain the adm mass m, hawking
temperature t and entropy s of the solution, which are found to be

where g10 = 2364 is the gravitational constant in ten dimensions and v3 is the spatial
volume of the world-volume of the d3-brane. we are interested in comparing these thermo-
dynamic quantities with those of black d3-branes without b elds. we have just found that
these quantities are independent of the parameter . thus they are exactly the same as those
without b eld [26] 3. furthermore, it is worth pointing out that it is independent of the
parameter  so that these thermodynamic quantities (2.7) are also those of black d-string
solution with two smeared coordinates. for later use, let us note the relation between the
numbers of d3-branes and d-strings in the solution (2.1). the charge density of d3-branes
is

(2.9)

where v2 is the area the rectangular torus spanned by the two smeared coordinates x2 and
x3. using the charge quantization rule we obtain the following relation between the number
n3 of d-branes and the number n1 of d-strings:

in the decoupling limit, the relation (2.10) becomes

(2.10)

(2.11)

where v2 = b2v2/2 is the area of the torus after rescaling. the excitation above the
extremality of the black d3-brane corresponds to a thermal state of the corresponding sym.
considering the limit (2.3), from (2.7) we have the energy e, temperature t and entropy of
the large n noncommutative sym in the strong coupling limit:

(2.12)

where v3 = b2v3/2. obviously these thermodynamic quantities satisfy the rst law of
thermodynamics de = t ds. the free energy f of the gauge theory, dened as f = e t s,
can be expressed in terms of the temperature:

quantities in [26].

(2.13)

of course, the free energy is also the same as that of ordinary sym [24,27]. this result is
quite interesting, which leads maldacena and russo [12] to argue that at any given scale the
total number of degrees of freedom of the noncommutative sym coincides with the ordinary
case in the large n limit. no doubt it would be of much interest to further investigate this
result and try to see if this is modied by any corrections. motivated by this observation,
we are now going to compute the higher derivative term corrections to the free energy of
the noncommutative sym.

iii. the 3r4 corrections to the free energy

the black conguration (2.1) is an exact solution of type iib supergravity, which is a
low-energy approximation of superstring, keeping only the leading contribution of massless
states in the  expansion. the non-leading contributions from massive string states appear
as corrections to this low-energy action in the form of higher derivative curvature terms.
in type iib supergravity the lowest correction can be symbolically written as 3r4
,
where r represents the riemann tensor of spacetime. the tree-level contribution of the
four-graviton amplitude to the eective action is [28]

stree

r4 =

(3)

3  26  16g10 z d10xg3e2r4,

(3.1)

in the string frame. exploiting the eld redenition ambiguity [29] and noting that for
the d3-branes without b eld, the extremal background ads5  s5 is a conformally at
spacetime, the corrections can be written in the einstein frame as [27,30]

i tree

rsk +

c hkmncpqmnc rsp

h c q

rsk(cid:21) , (3.2)

where  = (3)3/8 and cpqmn denotes weyl tensor. such corrections to the free energy
of the ordinary sym on the three-torus t 3, the three-sphere s3, and even on a hyperbolic
space h 3 have been calculated in [27,3135]. in particular, for the large three-torus t 3 case
the free energy correction is [27]

f tree

r4 =

thus the free energy including the correction is

r4 =

v3t 4(cid:20)1 +

so that the leading correction is positive. if one writes the total free energy as

(3)3/2 +    .

(3.6)

it is expected that the interpolation function f smoothly approaches 1 in the weak coupling
limit (  0) [27].
tributions are also of the form r4 and of the same order (3). if one writes

in fact in the type iib supergravity the one-loop and non-perturbative d-instanton con-

 = 1 + i2 = c(0) + i e,

(3.7)

where c(0) is the rr pseudoscalar, the eective action of the r4 part can be expressed as
[28,30]

r4 =

(3.8)

for the small string coupling which is required for the validity of the supergravity description,
the function f4 can be expanded as [30]

zm m 1/2(cid:16)e2m (e+ic(0)) + e2m (eic(0))(cid:17)(cid:16)1 + o(e/m)(cid:17) , (3.10)

where m runs over integers. here the rst term gives the tree-level contribution, the second
term gives the one-loop contribution, and the remaining denotes the contribution of the
non-perturbative d-instantons. the coecient zm is dened as

zm  xm|m

1
m2 ,

(3.11)

where m|m denotes that the sum is taken over the divisors of m. considering the contri-
butions from the one-loop term and from d-instantons, 2(3)3/2 in eq. (3.6) is replaced

tribution to the entropy correction (s = (f )/t ) is

(3.13)

in the eective low energy action of type iib supergravity, except for the r4 terms, in
the same order (3) there exist other terms, for instance, eight-derivative four-dilaton term
[36], supersymmtric terms accompanying r4 terms, and so on (see [27,37] and references
therein). for the ordinary sym, however, those terms will not make contributions since
the dilaton is a constant and the 5-form eld strength is the same as that in the extremal
background. for the noncommutative sym, namely the black d3-branes with nonvanishing
b eld, from (2.5) we see that the dilaton is no longer a constant and hence its derivative
terms and other possible terms involving the derivatives of dilaton and curvature tensors
are expected to make contribution to the free energy correction. also other terms unknown
so far might have potential contributions in this order. unfortunately, till now there has
not been a complete expression of the eective low energy action to the order (3), to
the best of our knowledge. this makes it dicult to evaluate the free energy correction of
noncommutative sym via the supergravity description and to compare with the ordinary
sym case.4

to resolve this diculty, we will adopt the following approach to attain insight into
the (3) correction to the free energy of the noncommutative sym, rather than the usual
way to evaluate the free energy correction by substituting the unperturbed solution (2.4)
into those terms of the order (3) all of which are not known exactly. as is well known,
the t-duality is a perturbative symmetry of full string theories valid loop by loop. this
symmetry holds in the low energy supergravities as well. the low energy eective action
remains unchanged under the t-duality transformation. therefore if one can transform the
solution (2.4) with the varying dilaton to a solution with a constant dilaton, one may get
the free energy correction of the former via the latter. indeed it has been found that such
a t-duality transformation exists.

following [38], dening

also thank the referee for valuable comments on this point.

for c = 1 and d = v2/(2)2b when the latter is an integer. note from (2.11) that d =
n1/n3 must be a rational number.
if this is not an integer, after some steps of morita
equivalence transformation as in [38], one can reach a solution like (3.16). the solution
(3.16) is asymptotically of the structure ads5  s5, completely the same as that describing
the ordinary sym at nite temperature. actually the solution (3.16) describes a twisted
ordinary sym due to the presence of a constant ns b eld. the ordinary sym lives on a
dual torus with area v2 = (2)4b2/ v2 and its yang-mills coupling constant is

g2

(3.18)

this ordinary sym is equivalent to the noncommutative sym described by the solution
(2.4) in the sense of the morita equivalence [38]. note further that the number of d3-branes
in (3.16) is v2n3/(2)2b = n1 according to (2.11), rather than n3 in (2.4).
it is quite
interesting to note that the area, the yang-mills coupling constant and the rank of the
gauge group of the ordinary sym in (3.16) are dierent from those of the noncommutative
sym in (2.4), but that the t hooft coupling constants for both theories are the same

we conclude that the thermodynamics of the solution (3.16) is the same as the one of the so-
lution (2.4), that is, the thermodynamics of the noncommutative sym because the hawking
v3. indeed, the morita equivalence transforma-
temperature is unchanged and n 2
1
tion will not change the thermodynamics of gauge eld theory [38]. thus we expect that
the 3r4 correction in (3.16) gives us the free energy correction of the noncommutative
sym in the order (3). as just mentioned above, the advantage to consider the solution
(3.16), rather than (2.4) is that one does not have to worry about the contributions from
the derivative terms of dilaton and possible other terms since the dilaton and the ns b eld
are constants here.

now it is easy to get the free energy correction of noncommutative sym from the (3)
terms in the eective low energy action according to the above consideration. it is obtained
from that in the ordinary case discussed in [27], eqs. (3.5), (3.6) and (3.12) with the replace-
ym, v3 by v3 and n3 by n1 = v2n3/(2)2b, respectively. considering
ments of g2

noncommutative sym by replacing

comparing this with the ordinary case (3.12), we see that the rst term is unchanged, but
the remaining two terms are suppressed because (2)2b/ v2  1. recall that the rst term
comes from the tree-level contribution, the second term from the one-loop contribution and
the third is the non-perturbative d-instanton contribution. this indicates that in the strong
t hooft coupling the large n noncommutative and ordinary syms are equivalent because
the rst term corresponds to the planar diagrams and the second term to the non-planar
diagrams. this result is also consistent with the argument, which is made in the weak t
hooft coupling limit, that planar diagrams depend on the noncommutativity parameter only
through the external momenta and non-planar diagrams are generally more convergent than
their commutative counterparts [19]. the previous and the present sections provide evidence
of the equivalence between the large n noncommutative and ordinary syms. it would be
interesting to accumulate further evidence for this equivalence. in the next section we will
do it by studying the thermodynamics of a probe brane in the background (2.4).

iv. the thermodynamics of a probe brane

we know that the solution (2.1) describes n3 d3-branes coinciding with each other. the
conguration represents the noncommutative sym with gauge group u(n3) in the higgs
branch, in which the vevs of scalar elds are zero. therefore the thermodynamics given in
section ii is the one for noncommutative sym in the higgs branch. we now want to discuss
the thermodynamics of the noncommutative sym in the coulomb branch, in which the
vevs of some scalar elds do not vanish. corresponding to the coulomb branch should be a
multicenter conguration of d3-brane solutions. one of the simplest cases is that n parallel
coinciding d3-branes are separated along a single transverse direction by a distance from a
single d3-brane. the gauge symmetry is then broken from u(n +1) to u(n)u(1) and the
distance can be regarded as a mass scale in the gauge eld. however, no stable, multicenter,
non-extremal congurations of d-branes have been known.5 as an approximation, one may
consider the probe method. that is, we put an unexcited probe brane in the background
of other non-extremal d-branes and regard this as an approximate multicenter solution.
such a method has been used recently to study the thermodynamics of sym in the higgs
phase [4144].

considering that the noncommutative and ordinary syms have the same thermody-
namics at a given scale in the higgs branch, it would be interesting to compare them also in
the coulomb branch. to this aim, in this section, we investigate the thermodynamics of a
probe in the non-extremal d3-brane background. according to the interpretation of d-brane
action, the supergravity interaction potential between the probe and the near-extremal d3-
branes (as the source) can be interpreted as the contribution of massive states to the free
energy of gauge elds in the large n and strong t hooft coupling limit [41]. when ns b
eld is present, the dynamics of a probe d3-brane is governed by the following action:

5it is possible to have non-extremal congurations for continuously distributed d-branes. for
d3-branes, see [39,40], for example.

10

s = t3z d4xeq det( g  b(1))  t3z c  t3z b(2)  b(1),

(4.1)

where t3 = 1/(2)32 is the tension of d3-brane.
in fact this is a bound state probe
consisting of d3-branes and d-strings. an explicit evidence for this is the tension of the
probe is t31 + tan2 . we will see more evidences below.

substituting the solution (2.1) into the probe action (4.1), one has

s =

where we have subtracted a constant potential at spatial innity and

h0 = 1 +

r4 .

(4.2)

(4.3)

in the extremal background where f = 1, one can see from (4.2) that the static interaction
potential between the probe and the source vanishes. note that the source is a non-threshold
bound state consisting of d3-branes and d-strings, and the static potential will no longer
vanish unless the probe is also the same bound state. in the non-extremal background, of
course, the static potential exists always. in the decoupling limit (2.3), we arrive at

fp =

which agrees with the result in [41] and [42] for a d3-brane probe in the near-extremal
d3-brane background without b eld.6 when the probe is on the horizon of the source, the
free energy of the probe is

fp|u=u0 = 

v3n3u4
0
42 = 

2 v3n3t 4

.

comparing with the free energy of the source (2.13), we nd that

fp|u=u0 =

df
dn3

.

the number of d3-branes in the probe is 1, so we may rewrite the above equation as

fp|u=u0  f (n3 + 1)  f (n3),

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

for a large n3. this implies that from the point of view of thermodynamics, the non-extremal
d-branes live on the horizon because the probe branes on the horizon can be viewed as a
part of source branes.

6there is a small dierence between the probe free energies in [41] and [42], which arises as
2r4u4 , the dierence h0  h
follows. in the decoupling limit, although h0 
does not vanish, but gives a nite value u4
2u4 . this is just the additional term appearing in [42].
the additional term is important in the interpretation of the probe free energy.

in the low-temperature or long-distance limit, expanding the free energy (4.4) and using

u0 = t , we get 7

(4.8)

this is consistent with the expectation that, in the weak coupling and low-temperature limit,
the contributions of one- and two-loops are exponentially suppressed [41,42]. the leading
term is a three-loop contribution.

in the high-temperature or short-distance limit, we have to use the isotropic coordinates

dened in (5.3) below 8. dening the mass scale m = (2  u0), we obtain

fp = 

2 v3n3t 4

expanding (4.9) for the small m/t yields

(4.9)

(4.10)

let us compare this with the free energy in the weak coupling limit. the one-loop free energy
of the n =4 sym in the weak coupling has the following high-temperature expansion [41]:

fm (t  m) =

t(cid:19)

+   # .

(4.11)

it is very similar to that for the strong coupling limit (4.10) except the term (m/t ) is
absent in the weak coupling. in particular, in the massless approximation keeping only the
leading terms in (4.10) and (4.11), one may see that there is also the well-known dierence
by a factor of 3/4, which occurs in comparing the supergravity calculation and weak coupling
calculation of the entropy for the n =4 sym in the higgs branch [24,27].
the main result of this section is that the static interaction potential between a d3-brane
probe with ns b eld in the background of d3-branes with b eld is the same as that of a
d3-brane probe in the corresponding background without b eld. from the point of view
of eld theory, the static potential comes from planar diagrams [45], which is more clear
from the viewpoint of open strings extended between the probe branes and source branes.
this further renders evidence that the large n noncommutative and ordinary syms are
also equivalent in the strong coupling limit.

7note that there is a dierence by a factor of r2 in the rescaling of r and r0 from the denitions
in [41] and [42].
8note that there is a dierence by a factor of 2 in the denition of the coordinate  between
this paper and [41,42]. if we use the denition in [41,42], the metric will not be asymptotically at
as   .

v. the stress-energy tensor of the noncommutative sym

in section ii we have seen that the entropy of the noncommutative sym is the same as
that of the sym at a given temperature scale or energy scale. however, from the einstein
frame metric of (2.4) we see that, when u  , the area of the torus x2, x3 contracts, while
the radius of the s5 expands. the contraction of area of the torus is just compensated by
the expansion of the volume of the s5. this seems to imply that there is a redistribution
of the degrees of freedom [12]. to compare the distribution of thermal states between the
noncommutative sym and ordinary sym, it is enough to calculate the stress-energy tensor
of the noncommutative sym on the supergravity side.

for this purpose, we adopt the method developed by myers [25] by generalizing the adm
mass density formula of p-branes [46]. the stress-energy tensor for the p-brane world-volume
can be expressed as

tab =

1

16g2g10 zr

d8pr8pni[ab(ihc

c + ihj

j  jhj

i)  ihab],

(5.1)

where ni is a radial unit in the transverse subspace, while h = g   is the deviation
of the (einstein frame) metric from that for at space. the labels a, b = 0, 1,   , p run
over the world-volume directions, while i, j = 1, 2,   , 9  p denote the transverse direc-
tions. in addition, it should be reminded that the calculations in (5.1) must be done using
asymptotically cartesian coordinates.

rewriting the einstein metric (2.6) in isotropic coordinates, one has

ds2

e = h1/4h 1/2[f dx2

0 + dx2

from the extremal background, which must be subtracted from it in order to acquire the
required quantity. the contribution of the extremal background can be obtained directly
from (5.4) by setting r0 = 0:

subtracting (5.5) from (5.4) and taking the near-extremal limit, r4  r4  r4

get the stress-energy tensor for the noncommutative sym in the large n and strong coupling
limit

(5.7)

for  = 0, eq. (5.6) reduces to the result for the ordinary sym, which is of the form of an
ideal gas in 3+1 dimensions. in that case, its trace is zero. this is in accordance with the
fact that the ordinary sym is conformally invariant in four dimensions. on the other hand,
for  6= 0, eq. (5.6) gives the stress-energy tensor for the noncommutative sym. in this
case, the tensor is not isotropic and its trace does not vanish. it reects the fact that the
noncommutative sym is not conformal even in four dimensions due to the noncommutativity
of space. in addition, we conrm that the t00 component of the stress-energy tensor (5.6)
in the decoupling limit indeed gives the energy density of the noncommutative sym given
in (2.12).

vi. conclusions

to summarize, we have investigated some aspects of thermodynamics for the noncommu-
tative sym in the large n and strong t hooft coupling limit on the supergravity side, and
compared them with the ordinary case. although the entropy and other thermodynamic
quantities of black d3-branes with ns b elds are the same as those without b elds, the
stress-energy tensor of thermal excitations is dierent. for the ordinary sym the stress-
energy tensor is of the form of an ideal gas in four dimensions. it is isotropic and its trace
is zero. on the other hand, for the noncommutative sym, the tensor is not isotropic and
its trace does not vanish, which conrms that the noncommutative sym is not conformally
invariant even in four dimensions due to the noncommutative nature of space. note that in
the solution (2.1) the ns b eld has component only in x2, x3 directions. this means that
the coordinates x2 and x3 are noncommutative, while x0 and x1 are the ordinary commuta-
tive coordinates. one may consider more general d3-brane solutions with both b01 and b23
components. we do not expect that the stress-energy tensor will be isotropic in that case
either. the result is indeed so, and we have conrmed this by a very similar calculation to
that in section v.

we have considered the higher derivative term corrections in the order (3) to the free
energy of the noncommutative sym in the section iii. because there has not been a complete
expression of the low energy eective action of type iib supergravity to the order (3),
to make sense of the calculation and to compare the case of the ordinary case which has
been investigated in [27], we transformed the near-extremal d3-brane solution with varying
dilaton to a solution (3.16) with a constant dilaton by a t-duality transformation. those two
solutions are equivalence in the sense of the morita equivalence. using the latter solution,
we have found that the tree-level contribution is the same as the ordinary case, but the
one-loop and the non-perturbative d-instanton contributions are suppressed, compared to
the ordinary case. note that the tree-level part corresponds to the planar diagrams, and the
one-loop part to the non-planar diagrams in the eld theory. this provides evidence that

14

the large n noncommutative and ordinary syms are also equivalent in the strong t hooft
coupling limit.

we have also studied the thermodynamics of a bound state probe consisting of d3-
branes and d-strings in the background produced by the black d3-branes with b elds and
compared it with that of a d3-brane probe in the background produced by the black d3-
branes without b elds. in accordance with the interpretation of the d-brane action, the
free energy of a static probe can be regarded as the contribution of massive states to the free
energy of noncommutative sym in the higgs phase and the distance between the probe and
the source can be explained as a mass scale in the gauge theory. from the thermodynamics
of the probe we have found that the free energies for the ordinary and noncommutative
cases agree. in fact the dynamic interaction potential between the probe and the source
also agrees with the ordinary case. because the interaction potential comes from the planar
diagrams from the point of view of eld theory, the agreement further suggests that the
large n noncommutative and ordinary syms are equivalent not only in the weak coupling
limit [19], but also in the strong coupling limit.
