abstract

the solutions of the arbitrary-spin massless wave equations over r1  h 3 space
are obtained using the generalized coherent states for the lorentz group. the use of

these solutions for the construction of invariant propagators of quantized massless
elds with an arbitrary spin over the r1  h 3 space is considered. the expression
for the scalar propagator is obtained in the explicit form.

the method of generalized coherent states (cs) successfully applied for various physi-
cal problems [1] is a natural way of describing the quantized elds over symmetric spaces
too. in the previous paper[2] we applied this method for the description of quantum elds
in the sitter space. here we wish to apply this method to the massless elds over the
r1  h 3 space.

to obtain the wave equations over this space in a convenient form, at rst we write
down the bargmann-wigner equations for an arbitrary-spin particle in the minkowski
space in the form of four equations for the 2s + 1-component spinor (or, equivalently, for
some polynomial). we show that only two of these equations are mutually independent
and their covariant generalization yields the consistent wave equations over the r1  h 3
space. to obtain the solutions of these wave equations, we introduce two cs systems
for the lorentz group. the rst (scalar) system is determined by a spin zero innite-
dimensional representations of the lorentz group and corresponds to the coset space
h 3. the second (spinor) system corresponds to nite-dimensional representations of the

lorentz group and to the coset space so(3, 1)/{the little lorentz group of a light-like
vector}. the scalar cs system multiplied by eit gives the solution of the klein-gordon
equation for the conformally-coupled massless scalar eld over the r1 h 3 space. in turn,
the solutions of arbitrary-spin wave equations are presented by the product of the scalar
cs with the imaginary shift of the mass and spinor cs multiplied by eit. this allows
us to construct the quantized elds over the r1  h 3 space with the propagators being
invariant under the r1  so(3, 1) group. here we consider the spin zero case only and
show that the corresponding propagator has a standard form containing the -function.
the three-dimensional hyperbolic space h 3 is the hyperboloid of a radius r in a four-
dimensional lorentzian space with the ctitious fourth coordinate equal to rx, where
x = (1 + x2/r2)1/2. the symmetry group of the h 3 space is so(3, 1) and its irreducible
representations (j+, j) are well-known [3]. they are determined by two complex numbers
j+ and j which correspond to the eigenvalues of casimir operators of two so(3) subal-
gebras of the so(3, 1) algebra. for the case when j+ and j are integer or half-integer the
corresponding representation is nite-dimensional and non-unitary. in the opposite case
it is innite-dimensional and unitary and may be characterized by the spin s = 0, 1/2, . . .
and the frequency   r; then the weights are equal to

j+ = 

ir + s + 1

,

j =

ir + s  1

let us take xi as a set of coordinates over the h 3 space; then the metric over r1  h 3 is

gij = ij 

xixj
r2

,

g00 = 1 ,

g0i = 0.

the klein-gordon equation for the conformally coupled massless eld with spin zero over
the r1  h 3 space has the form

( + r2) = 0 ,   ( det g)1/2(( det g)1/2g).

(2)

it is shown in [4] that at   eit the above equation corresponds to the irreducible
representation of the lorentz group with the weights (1) for s = 0. the solutions of
eq. (2) may be presented in the form of plane waves analogous to that in the de sitter
space considered in [2]:

(x, t) = eitq(x; ir  1)

, q(x; ) = (cid:18)x 

qx

r (cid:19)

,

(3)

where q2 = 1. according to [1] the functions q(x; ) are the cs for some representation
of the lorentz group. for the case  = ir  1 it is irreducible representation for spin
zero particles.

the wave equations for massless particles with an arbitrary spin over the minkowski

space have the form [5]

(s + s) = 0,

(4)

where s are the generators of the corresponding nite-dimensional representation of the
lorentz group. according to [5], we consider the realization of the generators s as the
dierential operators acting on the variables z, z. then the wave function  should be
a polynomial in z and z of the power equal or less than 2j+ and 2j, respectively. we
restrict ourselves by the case of particles with the positive helicity; then the generators
s compose the representation (s, 0) and have the form

sik = iikljl

j+ = 


z

,

, s0i = ji,
j = z2 
z

j3 = s  z

.

here we introduce the indices +,  as a = a1  ia2 and ji are the generators of the spin
s representation of the so(3) group. putting  = i, 0 in eqs. (4) we obtain that they are
equivalent to

(s0 + jii) = 0,

vikk  (sik  s1jijk + iikljl)k = 0.

it is easy to show that

vi = z2v+i
v+ = s1z2 d2

v3i = zv+i

as a result, only one equation of eqs. (6) is independent; let us choose this equation as
v+ii = 0. computing the weyl tensor of the r1h 3 space we can show that it vanishes
and this space is conformally-at. then, by the virtue of the conformal invariance, the
consistent r1  h 3 wave equations for the massless particle with an arbitrary spin may
be obtained from eqs. (4) by replacing  by the covariant derivative

then, using the equality vikjk = 0, the covariant generalization of eqs. (5)-(6) takes the
form

s + 1

r (cid:19)  = v+iek

(i)k = 0.

(cid:18)t + s1jiek

(i)k 

(10)

it can be shown [4] that at   eit and s = 1/2, s = 1 the above equations correspond
to the irreducible representations of the lorentz group with the weights (1).

in the minkowski space the solutions of eqs. (4) are the products of the plane waves
eipx and so-called massless spinors for the nite-dimensional representations of the
lorentz group constructed in [6]. let us denote the stability subgroup of the minkowski
light-like vector (1, 0, 0, 1) as h; this group is called the little lorentz group of this vector.
let us consider the vector in the (j+, j) representation invariant under h with respect
to phase transformations. let us act on this vector by the transformation which turns
the vector (1, 0, 0, 1) into the light-like vector n = (, q) , q2 = 1. the vector from
the space of the (j+, j) representation corresponding to n is just the spinor connected
with the vector n. the above scheme realizes the construction of cs for the so(3, 1)/h
space in accordance with the general method proposed for an arbitrary lie group in [1].
one can obtain the polynomial form of the above mentioned spinors

|q; j+ji =  

1 + q3

2 !j++j

(1  zq)2j+(1  z q)2j,

(11)

where q = q1+iq2
to the factor j++j.

1+q3 . the spinor constructed in [5] coincides with the above expression up

it is easy to show that the equalities

(s1qiji  1)|q; s0i = v+iqi|q; s0i = 0,
(v+i + iv+mimnqn)|q; s0i = 0,
(iimnjmqn  sqi + j i)|q; s0i = 0

(12)

(13)

(14)

hold for any spin. note that eq. (14) follows from the equation (12) and decomposition (7).
to generalize the solutions (3) for arbitrary spin particles, let us construct the functions

f (s)
q (x) = q(x; ir  s  1)|q; s0i.

using (12)-(14) we nd that the functions

(x, t) = eitf (s)

q (x)

(15)

obey eqs. (10) for an arbitrary spin. under r   the functions (15) pass into the
usual plane waves in the minkowski space considered in [5] up to the multiplier s. the
solutions (15) are much simpler than the ones obtained for particles of spin 0, 1/2 and 1
over r1  s3 and s1  s3 spaces by other methods [7].

thus, like the case of de sitter space [2], solutions of the spinor wave equations over
h 3 space are the product of two cs systems with dierent stability subgroups. then we
can write down transformation properties of the f (s)
q (x)f unctions under the action of the
lorentz group and then construct the invariant two-point functions over the h 3 space.
also we can construct quantized massless elds over the r1  h 3 space using the func-
tions (15) and the creation-annihilation operators with the canonical (anti)commutation
relations. the propagators of these elds can be found using the above mentioned two-
point functions over the h 3 space.
in the spin zero case the lorentz-invariant scalar
product of two cs is the two-point function [1]

w (0)(x, y; ) = zs 2

d2q f (0)

q (x)f (0)

q,(y),

where x and y arbitrary points of the h 3 space and d2q = dq1dq2/q3 is the rotational-
invariant measure over s2. using the integral representations of the hypergeometric func-
tion [8] we get

w (0)(x, y; ) = 4 2f1(cid:18)ir + 1

where  is the geodesic distance between the x, y points dened by the relation cosh  =

now let us construct the quantized massless eld

d2q (cid:16)eix0

q (x)a(n; s) + eix0

where the bosonic creation-annihilation operators a(n) and a(n) obeying

[a(n), a(n)] = n03(n  n)

are introduced and n = (, q). then the corresponding propagator

d(x, y)  [(x), (y)] = z 



dei(x0y0)w(x, y; )

is invariant under the time translations and spatial so(3, 1) transformations. using
formulas [8] for the hypergeometric function at the special values of parameters the ex-
pression ( 16) can be represented as

w(x, y; ) =

4 sin r
r sinh 

.

(17)

the representation (17) coincides with the spherical function for the spin-zero innite-
dimensional representations of the lorentz group [3]. after simple manipulations with
the -function we obtain

d(x, t1; y, t1 + t) = 

4i
sinh 

(t2  r22)(t).

the above expression coincides with the dierence of the positive- and negative-frequency
wightmann functions, obtained previously by the standard methods [9], within the mul-
tiple (4)2.
