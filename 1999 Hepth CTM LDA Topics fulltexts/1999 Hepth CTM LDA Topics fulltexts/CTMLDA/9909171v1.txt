abstract: we consider the elastic scattering of two open strings living on two
d-branes separated by a distance r. we compute the high-energy behavior of the
amplitude, to leading order in string coupling, as a function of the scattering angle
 and of the dimensionless parameter v = r/(s) with s the center-of-mass
energy. the result exhibits an interesting phase diagram in the (v, ) plane, with a
transition at the production threshold for stretched strings at v = 1. we also discuss
some more general features of the open-string semiclassical world-sheets, and use
t-duality to give a quantum tunneling interpretation of the exponential suppression
at high-energy.

1. introduction

the purpose of the present work is to discuss some aspects of the high-energy xed-
angle scattering of open strings. in string perturbation theory such scattering is ex-
ponentially soft and is dominated by smooth semiclassical trajectories [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
from a technical viewpoint the external energy-momentum vectors can be thought
of as null minkowski charges on the worldsheet, and the saddle-point trajectories
correspond to congurations of electrostatic equilibrium. such congurations have
been exhibited at each order in the genus expansion by gross and mende [3]. they
describe the elastic scattering of two closed untwisted strings and also, after ap-
propriate identications [4, 5], of two open strings or of a single closed-string o a
d-brane. the amplitude for all these xed-angle processes decays exponentially fast
with the squared center-of-mass energy (s) or momentum transfer (t). the suppres-
sion is, however, less and less severe at higher orders, so that perturbation theory
will eventually break down [6]. this is consistent with the existence of some novel,
possibly parton-like structure at substringy distances [7] (see also [8, 9, 10]).

an interesting variation of the saddle-point problem arises when the scattering
strings are held a nite distance r apart. this can be the distance between two
d-branes in the case of open strings, or between two orbifold xed-points in the case
of twisted closed strings. for open strings, the leading contribution to the scattering
amplitude comes from worldsheets with cylindrical topology. the cylinder stretches
between the two distinct d-branes which, in the electrostatic analog, behave like
capacitor plates. our main technical result in the present work will be the exact
solution of this modied electrostatic problem, generalizing the result of [2, 4].

the relevant new parameter turns out to be v = r/(s), in accordance with
the naive expectation that the size of fundamental strings grows with the center-of-
mass energy as  s. we will show that the amplitude has an interesting phase

structure in the (v, ) plane, where  is the angle of scattering. as v ranges from
innity to zero at xed , our solution interpolates continuously between massless
closed-string exchange and the exponentially-soft behavior of [2, 4]. the electrostatic
equilibrium becomes unstable at v < 1, reecting the fact that we have crossed the
threshold for production of two massive stretched strings at an intemediate state.
this qualitative change of behavior may be of phenomenological relevance, partic-
ularly in the context of low-string-scale models, in which the threshold v = 1 for
nearby branes could be in the few-tev region.

the exponential suppression of the perturbative high-energy amplitudes is remi-
niscent of a quantum tunneling process, and also of a minimal surface (soap-bubble)
problem. t-duality in open-string theory makes these interpretations precise. open
string theory allows furthermore a better understanding of the relation between elec-
trostatic stability on the world sheet and unitarity cuts of the corresponding ampli-
tude. these simple comments have not been discussed to our knowledge previously in
the literature, and shed interesting new light on the physics of high-energy collisions.
we have devoted a (non-technical) part of our paper to explaining them.

the plan of the paper is as follows:

in section 2 we review the saddle-point
calculation of the disk amplitude, with an emphasis on topological features of the
semiclassical trajectory that generalize to higher orders.
in sections 3 and 4 we
set up and solve the saddle point problem on the annulus, and discuss the phase
diagram of the amplitude in the (v, ) plane. we end with some comments on t-
dual interpretations of the high-energy collision process.

2. topology of semiclassical trajectories

we consider the scattering of two incoming open-string states (1 and 2) into two
outgoing open-string states (3 and 4), with mandelstam variables s = (p1 + p2)2,
t = (p1 + p3)2 and u = (p1 + p4)2. the high-energy xed-angle behavior of the
amplitude does not depend on the details of the external states, provided all masses
are kept nite in the limit. we can assume thus for simplicity that all the external
states are massless. in terms of the center-of-mass energy e and scattering angle 
the mandelstam variables read

s = 4e2 , 

t
s

= sin2 
2

, and 

u
s

= cos2 
2

,

(2.1)

where  ranges from 0 for forward scattering to  for backward scattering. note that
in the physical kinematic region s is positive while t and u are negative. momentum
conservation implies that s + t + u = 0.

the three terms in the above amplitude correspond to dierent topological arrange-
ments of the external states, and are multiplied by the chan-paton factors tr(1324),
tr(1234) and tr(1243) respectively. using stirlings approximation for the gamma

strictly-speaking only the rst of the three terms in (2.2) has a well-behaved
asymptotic limit in the physical kinematic region. the other two have a series of
poles at integer values of s, corresponding to the excited open strings that can
propagate on-shell in the intermediate channel. for these singular amplitudes, the
asymptotic limit refers to the residue at the poles, or to the imaginary (absorptive)
part averaged over some range of incoming momenta. note that the amplitude
without s-channel poles is obtained when the incoming strings interact by joining
and splitting in the middle, as illustrated in gure 1. note also that the asymptotic

amounts to exchanging the mandelstam variables t and u.

it is instructive to rederive the above results by a saddle point calculation, in
which one extremizes the electrostatic energy of four null minkowski charges placed

at the boundary of a disk. the advantage of the electrostatic calculation is that it
can be extended to more general situations when the amplitude  an integral over
positions of the vertex operators and moduli of the world-sheet  does not admit a
closed-form expression. let us represent the disk as the upper-half plane, and let xi
be the points of insertion of the vertex operators on the boundary. the veneziano
amplitude is given by an integral

a(oooo)

disk

 z d eedisk ,

(2.5)

where  = (x1  x3)(x2  x4)/(x1  x2)(x3  x4) is the sl(2, r) invariant cross-ratio,
and the electrostatic energy reads

edisk = t log || + u log |1  | .

(2.6)

if we use the sl(2, r) symmetry to x x1 = 0, x2 = 1 and x4 = , then  = x3. the
(1324), (1234) and (1243) permutations of external states correspond therefore to the
integration intervals (0, 1), (1,) and (, 0). the rst of these three integrals is
as expected real and convergent, while the other two diverge as ||  , and must
be dened by analytic continuation.

the electrostatic energy edisk has a saddle point at

 = 

t
s

= sin2 
2

,

(2.7)

where it takes precisely the value in (2.4). since this is the only saddle point in
the complex -plane, we expect it to govern the behavior of the amplitude for any
ordering of the external states. what is important, however, to realize is that the
topology of the semiclassical trajectory is always of the (1324) type   goes in-
deed from 0 to 1 as the scattering angle ranges from 0 to . this is not of course
surprising : a smooth semiclassical trajectory of the (1234) or (1243) type would
have been incompatible with the fact that highly-excited open strings can propagate
on-shell at an intermediate stage. in the language of the electrostatic analog, the
two incoming particles attract so that they cannot equilibriate if they are adjacent.
note furthermore that the conguration (2.4) is one of stable equilibrium, as should
be expected of a saddle point which governs the behavior of an integral that is both
real and convergent. 1

extending these arguments to higher orders, leads us to expect that the saddle-
point trajectories have a topology forbidding one-particle intermediate states to go
on-shell. this can be achieved by insisting that successive scatterings are of the
non-planar type shown in gure 1. two such successive scatterings correspond, in

1the equilibrium is on the other hand unstable if we allow the charges to move o the real axis.
this reects the fact that in closed-string amplitudes one cannot suppress the s-channel poles by a
suitable choice of chan-paton factors.

particular, to the non-planar annulus diagram, three scatterings to the disk diagram
with a closed-string handle etc (see gure 2). more generally for any odd (or even)
number n of scatterings one nds a world-sheet topology with one (or two) bound-
aries and [ n1
2 ] closed-string handles. that the relevant semi-classical trajectories
should be of this type agrees with the observation of gross and manes [4] that, in
the corresponding electrostatic problem, empty world-sheet boundaries are shrunk
away to zero by electrostatic pressure.

3. deformed gross-mende saddle points

the elastic scattering discussed in the previous section assumed massless open-strings
living on a set of coincident d-branes. we want now to analyze what happens when
the scattering strings live on two d-branes separated by a distance r. the kinematics
of one such process is illustrated in gure 2. the two incoming open strings (1 and
2) live on two distant d-branes, as do the two outgoing strings (3 and 4). the am-
plitude, proportional to the chan-paton factor tr(13)tr(24), receives contributions
from world-sheets with at least two boundaries, so that the leading perturbative con-
tribution comes from the cylinder (or annulus) diagram. the topology of gure 2 is
special in that it does not allow one-particle unitarity cuts. the (12)(34) topology,
by contrast, has both open- and closed-string channel poles, the topologies with three
insertions on a boundary have intermediate open-string poles, while the topologies
with an empty boundary allow a massless closed-string to propagate at zero momen-
tum down the throat. following our discussion in the previous section, we should
therefore expect the relevant semiclassical trajectories to have the (13)(24) or the
(14)(23) topologies.

let us set up now the corresponding electrostatic problem. we consider the
annulus as a (doubling) torus of modulus  = i/2, modded out by a reection sym-
metry along the imaginary axis. the bosonic propagator for elds on the boundaries
reads

g(z| ) = log  ,  = 2ey2/2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

here the -dependence of the jacobi functions has been suppressed, and zij = zi  zj
is the relative position of the inserted vertex operators, which obeys rezij = 0, 1/2 for
i, j lying on the same or opposite boundaries. the amplitude is given by an integral
over the positions zi of the charges and over the modulus  of the world-sheet,

annulus  z d yi i dzi eeannulus .
a(oooo)

(3.3)

the novel feature in expression (3.2) is the contribution to the electrostatic
energy due to the stretching of the world-sheet between the two branes. it can be
thought of as the energy of a constant eld created by a xed potential drop between
the two boundaries of the surface. a simple scaling argument shows that the relevant
new parameter is

v =

r

s

.

(3.4)

this can be interpreted as the (inverse) ratio of the eective size of the incoming

strings, which grows as  s at high energies, to the distance r between the

branes. alternatively, it is the mass of a pair of strings that stretch between the two
d-branes, divided by the total center-of-mass energy. the signicance of these facts
will become apparent in the following section.

the saddle points of eannulus are harder to analyze than those of edisk. following
[3, 4] we focus our attention to congurations in which the four charges are

is then automatically extremized under variations of the zi. there are two such

(3.7)

where the -functions are evaluated at zero argument. the problem is now reduced
to that of nding extrema of these energies with respect to the surface modulus
 = i/2.

we will here solve this mathematical problem analytically  the physical impli-
cations of our results will be discussed in the following section. it will be enough to
analyze conguration (a), since for (b) we need only interchange the roles of s and
u in our nal expressions. extremizing the energy (3.6) with respect to  gives the

where j  j = i

of coincident branes [4]. the trick is to identify the mandelstam variables with the
three terms of the riemann identity 4

check that the ansatz

(3.9)

solves both the constraint s + t + u = 0, and the saddle-point equation when r = 0.
the saddle-point modulus  = i/2 is, in this special case, determined implicitly by
the picard map,

which is one-to-one from the fundamental domain for the modular group (2) to the
complex plane. the modulus  is hence a function of the scattering angle only, as
expected. the energy at the saddle point takes the value

2 e (a)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)v=0

(3.11)

(3.12)

which is exactly half the electrostatic energy on the disk, in agreement with the
one-loop result of gross and manes [4]. intuitively the exponential suppression is
less severe because the total momentum transfer is split between two equally-softer
scatterings. note incidentally that, at xed collision energy, the maximal suppression
is attained at right-angle scattering and corresponds to a square semiclassical world-
sheet ( = i).

extending the above trick to non-zero r requires a modular identity whose three
terms add up to a non-vanishing constant. such an identity, well known from the
study of bps saturated string amplitudes, is

this generalizes the picard map (3.10) to the case of non-coincident branes. for
later convenience we write explicitly also the relation obtained for the congura-
tion in which positions z2 and z4 have been exchanged. exchanging s and u (and
remembering that s entered also in the denition of v) we nd

(3.19)

as will be veried numerically in the coming section, these equations give all the
extrema of e (a) and e (b) on the real positive -axis. we will also see that depending
on the values of  and v, eq. (3.19) has one, two or zero real solutions  in the latter
case this means that our formal ansatz was inconsistent.

we close this section with some remarks on other possible saddle points. first, in
addition to a and b, there are four more congurations of electrostatic equilibrium,
at xed , corresponding to inequivalent permutations of the charges. the extrema
 of their energy must satisfy an equation obtained from (3.18) after an appropriate
permutation of the mandelstam variables. the (14)(23) extrema are in fact the same
as a and b, up to an exchange of  with   . for the (12)(34) congurations, on
the other hand, the -extremization has no solution, because the attracting pairs of
charges tend to shrink the boundaries of the annulus to a point. the corresponding
amplitude must be obtained by deforming the zi integration contours, as was the
case for the resonnant amplitudes at disk-level. a harder question concerns saddle
points in the complex  -plane, which become as we will see relevant in kinematic
regions where the (13)(24) amplitude must be analytically continued. for v = 0, all
saddle points are modular transform of one another, and yield the same energy as a.
for v > 0 however, modular invariance is broken and the degeneracy between these
saddle points is lifted.

4. phase diagram of the amplitude

we now want to use the above results in order to evaluate the amplitude for the
scattering process (13)(24) in the asymptotic high-energy limit. to this end let
us rst consider the potential singularities of the integral (3.3). its three possible
degeneration limits,

(a) z13 or z24  0 ,

(b)   0 , and (c)    ,

(4.1)

9

correspond to an intermediate (a) open string, (b) closed string, or (c) pair of
stretched strings going on shell. we have already argued that the rst two sin-
gularities are absent because the momentum owing out of a boundary is space-like.
it can be indeed veried immediately that the electrostatic energy (3.2) goes to +
in the limit (a), as long as the momentum transfer t stays negative. to analyze the
other limits one should note that, at xed , conguration b is a global minimum
of the energy. this is because the attracting (repelling) charges are as close (as far)
from each other as they could be. we need therefore only check whether the energy
of this conguration stays bounded from below as  varies. using the asymptotic
properties of  functions, and the denition (3.4) of the parameter v, we nd :

e (b) 0

 

t

vs

4

 +   

e (b) 

s
4

(v  1)  + 2s log 2 +    ,

(4.2)

(4.3)

where the dots denote exponentially-small corrections. the limit (b) is thus energet-
ically forbidden, as expected, while in the limit (c) the energy stays bounded from
below if and only if v > 1. the reason for this is easy to understand : v = 1 is the
critical separation at which the available center-of-mass energy suces to create a
pair of open strings stretching between the two branes. the instability of the elec-
trostatic problem for v < 1 signals therefore the opening of a two-particle production
threshold, and the appearance of an imaginary part to the amplitude.

since, for v > 1, the integral (3.3) is real and convergent, it must be dominated
by the minimum electrostatic energy in the integration range, i.e. by e (b)() at
 given implicitly by (3.19). we have solved this equation numerically, and have
plotted the results in gure 4. note rst that the solution to the equation is unique,
and that it corresponds indeed to a global minimum. the two interesting limits to
consider are (i) the limit of large brane separation (v  ) and (ii) the approach to
the stretched-string production threshold (v  1+). in the v   limit, the saddle
point approaches zero as   2t/r. and the amplitude takes the asymptotic

a simple calculation shows that it cannnot be accounted for by the exponentially-
rising density of intermediate states  it represents thus an eective exponential
enhancement (since t is positive) of the o-shell vertices. consider next the v  1+
limit. the imaginary (absorptive) part of the amplitude is easy to calculate at
threshold, because the two stretched strings are in their ground state and at rest. we
will see in the following section that the production of two large unexcited stretched
strings at rest in a collision is a process t-dual to elastic right-angle scattering. this

let us compare this to the electrostatic energy plotted for v = 1+ in gure 4. as
 goes from 0 to /2 the minimum of the energy rises from 0 to 2s log 2, where
it stays frozen while the angle of scattering continues to vary between /2 and .
thus the absorptive part saturates the amplitude for backward scattering, while it is
subleading when compared to the real part for forward scattering. the semiclassical
trajectory for backward scattering becomes singular (  ) at the threshold as
expected.

figure 5: phase diagram of the dominant saddle point. the saddle point is a global or
local minimum of energy in the two shaded regions. the slice at  = 2/5 is shown in
gure 6 as an illustration.

we next turn to the region v < 1. since e (b)() goes from  to , it must
now have an even number of extrema. what we have found numerically are two
distinct regions, separated by a boundary which goes from the point (/2, 1) to the
origin in the (, v) plane (see gure 5). in the left region e (b)() has two extrema 
a local minimum and a local maximum, depicted as b and b in gure 6  which, by
continuity, should govern the behavior of the real and of the imaginary parts of the
amplitude. in this region the absorptive part continues to be exponentially smaller
than the real part. as v approaches 1 from below, the local maximum saturates the
imaginary part of the amplitude (point c in gure 6), as the corresponding world-
sheet modulus runs away to innity. the local minimum on the other hand crosses
smoothly the v = 1 threshold, ensuring a continuous real part of the amplitude.
at the phase boundary the two saddle points coalesce (point d in gure 6), before
moving o the imaginary  -axis. in the right region, e (b)() has thus no real saddle

point at v < 1, and the amplitude must be governed either by the complex solutions
of (3.19), or else by the conguration a.

in order to clarify this issue we now turn to an analysis of the saddle-point
conguration a. in contrast to conguration b which is one of stable equilibrium on
a given surface, this conguration is unstable under displacements of the positions
zi, due to the proximity of repelling charges. an asymptotic analysis, on the other
hand, shows that e (a)() has a minimum  for all possible (v, ). we nd numerically
that this minimum is unique, and ranges from 0 to a nite value when v is increased
from zero to innity, in contrast to the v = 0 case where  runs away to innity
as the angle approaches  (see gure 7). in particular, the solution experiences no
discontinuity at the v = 1 threshold .

if conguration a is the dominant saddle-point when v = 0, we may expect it
to remain dominant throughout the lower right region of gure 5. our numerical
investigation of the solution shows, however, that this is impossible. the energy
e (a) at the phase boundary is larger than the energy e (b) (see gure 6), implying an
unacceptable exponential jump in the amplitude. such an exponential discontinuity
is, in particular, incompatible with our calculation of the absorptive part (4.6) near
threshold. thus the dominant saddle point in this region should be the complex
saddle-point of type b. as v goes to zero, the latter goes over to a modular transform
of the saddle point a, consistently with the hypothesis of [4] that a dominates the
amplitude when v = 0.

5. minimal surfaces and quantum tunneling

the exponential behavior of the amplitudes is suggestive (a) of quantum tunneling,
and (b) of a minimal-area problem.
in this section we will use t-duality to ren-
der these two statements explicit. though the mathematics do not change, t-dual
language renders as often several aspects of the physics more transparent. the key
point is that under t-duality the fastly-moving open strings can turn into very long
static strings stretched between far-separated d-branes.

consider in particular a kinematical conguration t-dual to right-angle scat-
tering, obtained by dualizing the direction of outgoing momenta. this amounts to
keeping p1 = (e, p, 0), p2 = (e,p, 0) while replacing p3 and p4 by the t-dual light-
like momenta w3 = (e, 0, r/2), w4 = (e, 0,r/2), characterizing a pair of
static unexcited strings stretching with opposite orientations between two d-branes.
the veneziano amplitude corresponds now to the amplitude for the production of
these static strings in the collision of two fastly-moving massless quanta. the ex-
ponential behavior of the amplitude conrms the expectation that such processes
should be suppressed by the small overlap of wavefunctions. this interpretation can
be used to reproduce the absorptive part of the one-loop amplitude of section 4.

another conguration t-dual to right-angle scattering, can be obtained by dual-
izing all four external momenta to w1 = (e, r/2, 0), w2 = (e,r/2, 0), w3 =
(e, 0, r/2), w4 = (e, 0,r/2). the veneziano amplitude is now inter-
preted as the amplitude for two oppositely oriented such strings to join and ip as
depicted in gure 8. this transition requires pulling the two stretched strings so that
they join in the middle, and can then separate in the perpendicular direction. the

energy barrier due to the string tension, (2 1)r/, is very large in the semiclas-

sical regime under consideration, so that the tunneling is exponentially suppressed.
the world-sheet instanton mediating this process corresponds to the minimal sur-
face interpolating between the world-sheets of the strings 1 and 2 in the far past and
those of 3 and 4 in the far future, and can be thought of as a soap-bubble problem
for a wire with the contour shown by the thick line on the left-hand side of gure 8.
deforming the square into a rhombus of angle  corresponds to going away from the
right-angle scattering point.

the saddle point analysis of high energy scattering actually tells us what is the
precise minimal surface for this soap-bubble problem. indeed, for a disk topology,
the saddle point semi-classical conguration is given by [3, 4]

it is easy to check that this solution satises the appropriate limits, for instance
x 0  i, x 1  r/, x 2  0 as z  0, where   [0, ] depends on the
direction in which z = 0 is approached. the area of the minimal surface is given
by the saddle point energy s log 2  this is smaller in particular than s/2 which
corresponds to the instantaneous transition of gure 8. in fact, as emphasized in
[3], higher genus world-sheets yield electrostatic energies which are a fraction of the
above; this implies that the area of the lm in the soap-bubble problem can be
reduced by creating handles. in a realistic setting this is counterbalanced by a cost
due to the extra curvature which prevents the surface from degenerating into a foam.
in string theory, the dominance of higher genus world-sheets implies that pertur-
bation theory breaks down at high energy, unless the string coupling gs controlling
the curvature cost is tuned to zero at the same time as the energy is increased [6]. in

particular, the contribution of d-instantons should be taken into account, and may
drastically modify the exponential softness of the amplitude. high-energy scattering
in the background of a d-instanton is known in particular to be power-suppressed
[9], implying that it is not a tunelling process. this is evident in our t-dual picture,
since a d-instanton t-dualizes into an euclidean d-brane cutting through gure 8
at a given time. the open string end-points can move freely on this slice, so that
there is no energetic barrier to the ip transition.

note added in proof. after the present work was completed, another work [11] ap-
peared which discusses some related issues in the context of brane-world models,
where quark and leptons are localized on separated walls. their treatment is purely
eld-theoretical, and gives thus the characteristic etr behavior that we have dis-
cussed in section 4. such a eld-theoretical treatment would be applicable if the
string scale were much heavier than the (standard model) kaluza-klein scale, which
does not occur in weakly-coupled type i models (see however [12] for such a model
in type iib theory).
