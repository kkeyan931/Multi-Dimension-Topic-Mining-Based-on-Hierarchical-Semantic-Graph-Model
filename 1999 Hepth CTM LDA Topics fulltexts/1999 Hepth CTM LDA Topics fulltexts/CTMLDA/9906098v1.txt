abstract

the geodesics of the rotating extreme black hole in ve spacetime dimensions found by
breckenridge, myers, peet and vafa are liouville integrable and may be integrated by additively
separating the hamilton-jacobi equation. this allows us to obtain the stackel-killing tensor. we
use these facts to give the maximal analytic extension of the spacetime and discuss some aspects
of its causal structure. in particular, we exhibit a repulson-like behaviour occuring when there
are naked closed timelike curves. in this case we nd that the spacetime is geodesically complete
(with respect to causal geodesics) and free of singularities. when a partial cauchy surface exists,
we show, by solving the klein-gordon equation, that the absorption cross-section for massless
waves at small frequencies is given by the area of the hole. at high frequencies a dependence on
the angular quantum numbers of the wave develops. we comment on some aspects of inertial
time travel and argue that such time machines cannot be constructed by spinning up a black
hole with no naked closed timelike curves.

introduction

the positive energy property of states in a supersymmetric theory excludes tachyons. tachyons
can lead to causal pathologies such as the tachyon telephone [1] . one may therefore ask whether
supersymmetry excludes the existence of closed timelike curves (ctcs). the answer is obviously
no. both at space with a periodically identied time coordinate and anti-de-sitter spacetime, ads

(rather than its universal covering spacetime gads), admit ctcs; in fact they admit closed timelike

geodesics (ctgs). they also admit the maximum possible number of killing spinors. however,
these two examples are not simply connected and the ctcs may be eliminated by passing to a
topologically trivial covering spacetime.

godel [2] rst realized1 that one could have ctcs in a completely non-singular, topologically
trivial solution of the einstein equations with matter satisfying the dominant energy condition.
however, his solution is neither asymptotically at (in fact it is a homogeneous spacetime) nor (as
far as we are aware) supersymmetric.

it is striking, therefore, that there exist asymptotically at bps solutions of the supergravity
equations of motion which admit ctcs [5]. these spacetimes, which we refer to as the bmpv
family, have a net angular momentum and represent, for suciently small values of the angular
momentum, black holes with degenerate and non-rotating horizons in ve spacetime dimensions.
the fact that the horizon is non-rotating is due to supersymmetry [6]. any supersymmetric so-
lution of the supergravity equations admits an everywhere causal killing eld, which precludes an
ergoregion.

the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the horizon has been shown to agree with that of a system
of d-branes and strings. it goes to zero as the angular momentum approaches a critical value. in
this under-rotating case the ctcs are enclosed inside a velocity of light surface (vls) which
lies inside the horizon. thus external observers cannot use the system as a time machine. this is
rather like the situation for rotating (and non-supersymmetric) kerr black holes in four spacetime
dimensions.

in the over-rotating case there are ctcs outside what supercially appears to be a horizon. one
might think that, as in the case with an over-rotating kerr solution in four spacetime dimensions,
this naked time machine would also admit naked singularities. one might then be able to argue
that time travel would be excluded by the cosmic censorship hypothesis, as appears to be the
case in four spacetime dimensions. however this is not so for our over-rotating solutions. in fact,
as we show later, causal geodesics cannot penetrate the region inside the horizon and so one
has a geodesically complete, simply connected, asymptotically at, nite mass, non-singular, time-
orientable spacetime containing a naked time machine. moreover the solution is superymmetric
and the energy momentum tensor satises the dominant energy condition.

this is potentially rather disturbing. however, the solution represents a spacetime conguration
which has existed for all time. the physically more interesting question is whether such a device
could be constructed starting from a spacetime containing no ctcs. according to the chronology
protection conjecture [7], this should be impossible. specically it should be impossible to pass

1causality violating spacetimes obeying einstein equations were found prior to godels work, most notably by
lanczos [3] and van stockum [4]. however, godel was indeed (to the best of our knowledge) the rst to exhibit a
spacetime with ctcs and explicitly discuss the possibility to travel into the past.

from the under-rotating to the over-rotating case, increasing the angular momentum of the space-
time and expending a nite amount of energy. if this were true, the situation would be similar to
that of theories admitting tachyons. one cannot speed up a sub-luminal particle to a speed equal
to, let alone greater than, that of light, using a nite amount of energy.

another source of interest for our study lies in the fact that the coexistence of rotation and
supersymmetry originates a rather peculiar geometry. the distribution of angular momentum must
be compatible with the requirement of a non-rotating horizon, which is achieved by having a non-
rigidly rotating spacetime. more specically, it was pointed out in [6] that a negative fraction of
the total angular momentum of the spacetime is stored behind the horizon. hence, the fact that
the horizon is static was interpreted as a cancellation of opposite dragging eects (figure 1).

figure 1: distribution of angular momentum in the bmpv spacetime

in this paper, we will embark on an investigation of these issues. a deeper understanding of the
exotic geometry and the causality violations of a bps vacuum state being our main motivations.
we begin our account in section 2 by discussing the isometry group. we then discuss some global
questions associated with the introduction of time coordinates and time functions. this is of
particular importance because, not only does the bmpv spacetime have event horizons at which
our usual ideas about time break down, but it also has closed timelike curves which leads to a
further breakdown of familiar temporal concepts.

in section 4 we discuss the global structure and geodesic ow of the bmpv spacetimes. our
task is then to start with the local form of the metric and obtain a maximal analytic extension. by
analytic, we mean that the metric is invertible and its components real analytic functions of the
coordinates in every chart of the atlas of charts covering the manifold. by maximal we mean that
every causal geodesic may either be extended for innite ane parameter values, in both directions,
or encounters a singularity. to do this we shall start in a neighbourhood of spatial innity where
the metric is asymptotically at and extend this region by following geodesics through the horizon,
where our initial coordinates will break down. the geodesics will either hit the curvature singularity
or pass through a cauchy horizon into some other asymptotically at region. however, for an over-
rotating black hole they will not be able to enter the black hole region at all. moreover, we discuss
how the dragging eects of the spacetime allow or prevent particles in free fall to enter the velocity
of light surface. we show that when geodesics penetrate the vls they can time travel, as judged
by the observer at innity, and we discuss the consistency of such time travel.

in order to follow the geodesics and check maximality, it is necessary to solve for their motion.
for this we make use of the constants of the motion arising from the large isometry group.
in
addition we show, by separating variables in the hamilton-jacobi equation, that an additional
constant of the motion arises, analogous to total angular momentum. its existence may be traced
to the existence of a second rank killing tensor which we investigate in section 3.

section 5 is devoted to the quantum mechanical problem of a spinless particle in this background.
a clear distinction is then found between the over and under-rotating cases. for the former, the
behaviour found for geodesics is conrmed and extended to all frequencies: the absorption cross
section, abs, is always zero. for the latter, abs is found to coincide with the area of the hole, for
small values of a frequency parameter, extending to the bmpv family previously known results
for static and 4 dimensional kerr black holes. these results suggest a speculation for the area
and entropy of over-rotating spacetimes. for high frequencies, the wkb approximation is used to
compute the absorption cross section. we nd it depends sensitively on the azimuthal angular
quantum number of the wave. this is in contrast with the result for small frequencies, for which
abs is dominated by the s-wave, hence insensitive to the angular momentum components.

section 6 elaborates on the impossibility of constructing an over-rotating black hole, starting
from an under-rotating one, under a reversible thermodynamical process. analogies with an ordi-
nary particle and tachyon are emphasised and a comparison with the kerr case is drawn. we end
up with a conclusion and discussion.

2 the bmpv spacetime and causality

the bmpv spacetime is described locally by the following metric:

ds2 = 2 [dt + f (d + cos d)]2 +

dr2
2 +

r2
4

[d2 + d2 + d2 + 2 cos dd],

(2.1)

where

 = 1 


r2 ,

f =



2(r2  )

,

(2.2)

and , ,  are the standard euler angles on su (2), with ranges 0   < , 0   < 2 and
0   < 4. we will also dene

l = (1 

22
r6 ),

the quantity which determines the location of the vls. accordingly, we dene the positive quantities
rh and rl by

(2.3)

(2.4)

 = (1 

r2
h
r2 ),

l = (1 

r6
l
r6 ).

the complete supergravity solution also contains two one-form potentials, corresponding to a
ramond-ramond gauge eld and a winding gauge eld. both dilaton and moduli elds are con-
stant.

according to [6] the adm mass is

m =

3
4g5

,

and the angular momenta are

(jl, jr) = (0,

),

where g5 is newtons constant in ve spacetime dimensions.

2.1 the isometry group

the bmpv spacetime is asymptotically at, stationary, with associated killing eld k, and in-
variant under the action of u (2), acting on with three-dimensional orbits which are spacelike near
innity. the asymptotic atness dictates that these orbits are copies of su (2)  s3, rather than
some quotient. the isometry group is therefore r u (2) with a simply transitive four-dimensional
subgroup r  su (2) with killing elds k, and r1, r2, r3. the last three may be thought of as
generating left translations on su (2). the fth killing eld, l3 may be identied with a a left-
invariant vector eld generating an additional right translation. in what follows it will be important
that all one parameter subgroups of su (2) are conjugate to a circle subgroup. thus, for example,
the orbits of r1, r2 and r3 are circles. the same remark applies to the the generators of right
translations l1, l2, l3. in the case of l3 the orbits are the bres of the hopf bration of s3.

if (0, 1, 2, 3) are the left-invariant one forms on r su (2), the metric may be written, near

innity, as [6]

ds2 = 2h0 +



2r2 3i2

+

dr2
2 +

r2

4 (cid:2)(1)2 + (2)2 + (3)2(cid:3) .

(2.7)

the spacelike coordinate r labels the orbits of r  su (2) and as long as  6= 0 the orbits of
r  su (2) are timelike.

because

the orbits of k are never spacelike. to avoid a naked singularity we choose  to be positive. it
follows that k has degenerate killing horizons at r = . they are smooth null hypersurfaces.

g(k, k) = 2,

(2.8)

because

g(l3, l3) = r2l,

(2.9)

the hopf bres, i.e. the orbits of l3, are timelike if l < 0, which is thus a region of closed timelike
curves. in this region, we shall say inside the time machine, the induced metric on the orbits of
su (2) is lorentzian. in fact the metric inside the time machine is similar to the outer reaches of
the lorentzian taub-nut metric.

the local metric form (2.1) is valid everywhere inside and outside the horizon, including at
points where l = 0. thus, the boundary of the time machine, which we call the velocity of
light surface (vls) is a smooth non-singular time-like hypersurface on which the killing eld
l3 becomes null.

because

g(k, l3) = 


r2 ,

(2.10)

inside the time machine the timelike killing eld l3 is future pointing or past pointing depending
if one takes the sign of  to be positive, these two cases correspond to
on the sign of .
1
2 or rl < rh ), which we shall refer to
whether the time machine lies inside the horizon (i.e.  < 
1
2 or rh < rl ),
as the under-rotating case, or the horizon lies inside the time machine (i.e.  > 
which we shall refer to as the over-rotating case.

the metric admits additional discrete symmetries of which the most important for us is that
corresponding to the simultaneous reversal of k and l3, i.e., to the simultaneous reversal of 0

5

and 3. thus, the simultaneous reversal of time and sense of rotation of the system leads to an
indistinguishable conguration. this invariance corresponds to pt symmetry.

2.2 time orientation and time functions

intuitively a time orientation on a spacetime m is a continuous assignment of a future light cone
at each point of spacetime. given such an assignment, one may tell whether an (oriented) causal
curve is moving to the future or to the past. if future directed casual curves are identied with the
worldlines of classical particles then past directed causal curves may, `a la stuckelberg and feynman,
be identied with the world lines of classical anti-particles. if spacetime lacked a time orientation
it would be impossible to distinguish classical particles from classical anti-particles. the lack of a
time orientation would preclude a conventional quantum eld theory in the background spacetime
since it leads to real quantum mechanics [8]. it is reassuring, therefore, that the bmpv spacetime
admits a global time orientation.

spacetime may only fail to be time orientable if it is not simply connected. moreover one may
always pass to a double cover of a non-time-orientable spacetime to obtain a spacetime which is
time orientable. however in a concrete case it may not be easy to determine the local direction
of time. this is specially true if the spacetime does not admit a time function. the simplest way
to provide a time-orientation is to give an everywhere non-vanishing causal vector eld v which is
deemed to point to the future. obviously v is deemed to point to the past. thus, and despite
its closed timelike curves, the bmpv spacetime is time orientable. one may provide it with a time
orientation by choosing for v the killing eld k, since

g(k, k) = (1 


r2 )2,

(2.11)

k is everywhere causal and never vanishes. note that for an ordinary, non-extreme, black hole
we could not use the time-translation killing eld to provide a time orientation because it is not
everywhere causal and moreover it vanishes on the boyer-kruskal axis.

the fact that one has a time orientation is no guarantee that one has a global time function.
the latter is usually dened as a continuous function t : m  r with dt 6= 0 whose level sets
are spacelike hypersurfaces and which each causal curve crosses once and only once. clearly a
spacetime, such as the bmpv spacetime, with closed timelike curves cannot admit a global time
function. the best one can do is to construct a local time function.

2.3 local time functions adapted to a killing eld

given a causal killing vector k, one might try to nd a time function t by solving the equation

kt = 1.

(2.12)

the equation (2.12) is a rst order partial dierential equation which one may solve as follows in a
small neighbourhood u  m in which k is timelike. one picks as an initial level set of the function
t an arbitrary spacelike hypersurface in u , call it s, transverse to k, and assigns it the value t = 0.
the function t is then extended o s by solving equation (2.12) along the integral curves of k. if

6

xi are local coordinates on s, they may be extended to the neighbourhood u by the stipulation
that they be co-moving, that is, constant along the integral curves of k:

kxi = 0.

in the neighbourhood u the metric then may be given the form

ds2 = v 2(dt + aidxi)2 + ijdxidxj,

(2.13)

(2.14)

where the quantities v , ai and ij depend only on the coordinates xi. changing the initial hyper-
surface s corresponds to the gauge transformation

under which

t  t + f (xi),

ai  ai  if,

(2.15)

(2.16)

but the function v and the metric ij remain unchanged. they are invariantly dened as the
length of the killing eld k and the projection of the spacetime orthogonal to k respectively.
the metric induced on s, gij = ij  v 2aiaj, is not gauge-invariant since it depends upon the
choice of s. a time function corresponds to an initial hypersurface s such that the metric gij
induced on it is positive denite. if this is not so we merely have a time coordinate. some of the
apparent puzzles and paradoxes connected with time travel may be resolved if one bears in mind
the distinction between a time coordinate and a global time function. whenever ctcs are present,
only the former can exist. but the ability to choose some arbitrary initial data on a t = constant
hypersurface relies on it being a cauchy surface, which is only the case if t is a global time function.
this remark will be illustrated later.

note that if

fij = iaj  jai = 0,

(2.17)

then one may pick an f such that ai = 0. this is the static case for which the one form g(k, ) =
v 2dt. the hypersurface s is picked out, up to a time translation, by the condition that it ought
to be orthogonal to the integral curves of k.

2.4 spacetime as a real line bundle and the sagnac connection

there are several reasons why the procedure above might fail globally. for example, the killing
eld may vanish somewhere in the spacetime m . this does not happen for the bmpv spacetime
so we ignore this possibility. it then follows that we may regard the spacetime m as a principal r
bundle over a base space b which may be thought of as the space of orbits of the time translation
group. the projection map  : m  b is the assignment to each point in spacetime of the unique
integral curve of k passing through that point. this bundle might be called the gravitomagnetic
or coriolis bundle, with structural group given by time translations.

if the orbits of k are everywhere timelike, the metric g on the bundle m determines a connection,
let us call it the sagnac connection [9], such that a horizontal curve is one which is orthogonal to
the integral curves of k.

7

in this language the construction of a time function amounts to picking a local section s of the
bundle, which is moreover required to be spacelike. the pull back of the curvature of the sagnac
connection to b is just the two-form fij. if the time translation group were the circle s1 rather
than the line r, it is possible that no global section of the bundle exists. however this cannot
happen if the group is r.

what can happen, however, is that the killing eld k can fail to be everywhere timelike. thus
the metric form (2.1) may break down, and the sagnac connection become ill-dened. in the case
of the bmpv black hole this happens where  = 0. thus we cannot extend the time coordinate
t beyond the horizon at r = . inspection of the metric form (2.1) shows that, apart from the
usual angular coordinate singularities of euler angles, (t, r, , , ) are good coordinates throughout
the exterior of the hole, r > . one may also use the same form but where t is not the same
coordinate throughout the region in which 0 < r < . we shall call these two charts the exterior
patch uext and interior patch uint respectively. neither covers the horizon. thus they certainly do
not constitute a complete atlas.

for the bmpv black hole the metric ij orthogonal to the orbits of k is given by

ijdxidxj =

dr2
2 +

r2
4

((1)2 + (2)2 + (3)2),

(2.18)

while if 0 = dt then gij is

gijdxidxj =

dr2
2 +

r2
4

((1)2 + (2)2 + l(3)2).

(2.19)

it is clear, therefore, that the time coordinate t ceases to be a time function inside the time machine,
since the metric gij becomes timelike there.

in the over-rotating case we can use t as a time coordinate outside the horizon but we shall
nd that a future directed timelike curve, indeed a geodesic, can move backwards in that time
coordinate.

the sagnac connection of the bmpv metric is

aidxi =


2r2

3,

(2.20)

which is perfectly well dened on the timelike hypersurface which bounds the time machine. if one
computes the sagnac curvature one nds that it is anti-self dual with respect to the four-dimensional
conformally at metric ij. this becomes clearer if one introduces isotropic coordinates x, with

|x| =pr2  . if h is the harmonic function on four-dimensional euclidean space e4 given by

(2.21)

h = 1 +


x2 ,

then the bmpv metric may be written as

where

ds2 = h2(dt + aidxi)2 + hdx2,

i 3
jijh,

ai = 


2

8

(2.22)

(2.23)

and where i 3

ij is a constant self-dual form on e4. the sagnac curvature is then given by

fij =

2
x4

i 3
ij,

(2.24)

where i 3

ij is an anti-self-dual tensor.

the isotropic coordinates cover the exterior region in both the under and the over rotating case.
one obtains a solution representing k black holes by taking the harmonic function h to have k
poles [10].

2.5 axi-symmetric stationary time machines

in order to facilitate comparisons with some well known and more familiar spacetimes with closed
timelike curves it will prove useful to develop a general formalism valid for stationary spacetimes
which admit, in addition, a circle action. the killing eld generating the circle action will be called
m. it is well dened by demanding the integral curves to be closed circles. the circle group is
given by the coordinate , with range 0    2. we will, in addition, assume that the metric is
invariant under the simultaneous reversal of k and m. in other words, that the action of r  s1
is orthogonally transitive. in the case of the bmpv black hole,  =  and m = l3.

if  is a conventional angle, this symmetry corresponds to p t symmetry. however the formalism
works perfectly well if  parameterises an internal or higher dimensional angle `a la kaluza-klein.
one is then assuming ct symmetry. in this interpretation, angular momentum corresponds to
electric charge and angular velocity corresponds to electrostatic potential.

under these assumptions, the metric may be written as

ds2 = v dt2 + 2w dtd + xd2 + gabdxadxb,

(2.25)

where a = 1, . . . , n  2 are coordinates on the orbit space n = m/(r  s1), and the functions
v, x, w depend on xa. ergospheres are given by v = 0 and the velocity of light surface is given
by x = 0. the metric on the t   plane has determinant 2, with

2 = v x + w 2.

(2.26)

hence, at points where k and m are non-zero and linearly independent, the 2-surfaces of transitivity
of r s1 are timelike as long as 2 > 0. in that case any ergospheres and velocity of light surfaces
are timelike. the 2-surfaces of transitivity can become light-like, corresponding to a killing horizon
of some linear combination l = k + hm of the two killing vectors. this corresponds to a killing
horizon with null generator l. a necessary condition is that 2 = 0. the quantity h is the angular
velocity of the horizon. in the case of the bmpv black hole one has 2 = (r/2)2, and since the
horizon is at r = rh, we have h = 0.

one may express the metric as

ds2 = v (dt 
thus the sagnac connection is given by

(2.32)

if 2  0, as is the case for the bmpv black hole, and when x is positive, e must be positive for a
particle moving forwards in time and negative for a particle moving backwards in time. the latter
can be though of as an antiparticle. however, as we shall see, a particle with positive energy e will
not necessarily move forwards with respect to the coordinate t. inside the time machine, where x
is negative, it may be possible for the particle to move backwards with respect to the coordinate
t. clearly, the energy term is then negative, but the phenomenon is actually a consequence of a
detailed balance between the two terms in (2.31).

it is useful to dene a quantity

v 0 = 

w

j.

(2.33)

it tells us whether particles move forward or backward with respect to the coordinate t.
if we
suppose that 2 > 0, then a particle with positive energy e will move forward with respect to the
coordinate t as long as

e > v 0

(2.34)

outside a time machine, (i.e.
if x > 0). of course, this must be the case, since the light cone
structure of the spacetime does not allow classical causal particles to move backwards in time
outside the time machine. thus, (2.34) must follow from causality. this is illustrated in section
4.5. inside a time machine (i.e. if x < 0), to move forward with respect to t one must have

e < v 0.

(2.35)

the metric dependence of the quantity v 0 also governs the dragging of inertial frames. for example,
a particle with zero angular momentum will be dragged around in  as

(2.37)

(2.38)

the quantities v  serve as eective potentials. consider the space r n with coordinates (e, xa),
where n is the orbit space =m/(r  s1). outside the time machine the allowed values of energy
lie above or below the surfaces e = v  while inside a time machine the allowed values of e lie
between the surfaces e = v . the surface e = v 0 lies between the the surfaces e = v . inside
the time machine, it bounds the region in which the particle moves backwards with respect to the
coordinate t.

the same quantity governs solutions  of the klein-gordon equation. if  = (xa)ei(etj),

one nds that

1
a(gaba) =

x
2 (e  v +)(e  v ).



(2.39)

in the case of the bmpv black hole, where there exists an additional set of constants of the
motion, one may rene the idea of an eective potential. by using the constants one gets a
modied eective potential which depends only on the radial variable. in eect the extra constants
are included in an eective mass term. the results about the allowed regions and travel backwards
in time go through in a similar way.

2.6 ingoing null coordinates

in order to pass through killing horizons one may introduce an ingoing or advanced null time
coordinate v satisfying the conditions that

kv = 1,

(2.40)

and the surfaces of constant v are null hypersurfaces. it is convenient to change the euler coordinate
 at the same time. thus one denes

and hence

dv = dt + f (r)dr,

din = d + g(r)dr,

3

in =  + g(r)dr,

(2.41)

(2.42)

(2.43)

where the functions f (r) and g(r) are chosen to render zero the metric coecients of dr2 and
3
indr. it follows that not only are the surfaces v = const ingoing null hypersurfaces but that the
null generators (which are in fact ingoing null geodesics) are given by in = constant,  = constant,
 = constant. one must choose

(2.44)

(2.45)

(2.46)

in)2(cid:3) ,

4 (cid:2)(1)2 + (2)2 + l(3

the metric becomes

where we have used the identity that

(1)2 + (2)2 = (1)2 + (2)2.

(2.47)

by time reversal invariance there is an analogous set of outgoing or advanced null coordinates

u, out, obtained by reversing the signs of f and g.

the ingoing or outgoing null coordinate systems break down as one reaches the boundary of the
time machine. this is because the null generators of the null hypersurfaces v = constant are ingoing
null geodesics with zero angular momentum. as as we shall see later, ingoing null geodesics with
zero total angular momentum cannot enter the time machine. however if the time machine lies
inside the horizon, then ingoing and outgoing null coordinates remain non-singular as one crosses
the horizon. in what follows we shall call these two types of patches uin and uout.

this information is almost sucient to construct the maximal extension in the under-rotating
case. we start in the exterior with an ingoing patch which takes us through the horizon into the
region between the horizon and the time machine. we now use an outgoing patch to take us outside
into another exterior patch.

3 stackel-killing tensor

it is well known that spacetime isometries give rise to constants of motion along geodesics. however,
the converse statement is not true in general: not all conserved quantities along geodesics arise
from an isometry of the manifold and associated killing vector eld. such integrals of motion are
related to hidden symmetries of the manifold, which manifest themselves as tensors of rank n > 1,
satisfying a generalized killing condition, namely d(k1..n) = 0. they are usually referred to as
stackel-killing tensors. one way to think of such hidden symmetries is as homogeneous functions
in momentum of degree n, k(n)(p), which are dened in phase space, and which commute with the
hamiltonian in the sense of poisson brackets. in the cotangent bundle, all k(n)(p) are on equal
footing, including the n = 1 case. however, projection to base space introduces an asymmetry,
since only linear functions in momentum will survive, and hence killing vectors and tensors seem
to play dierent roles in conguration space.

we now compute the most general stackel-killing tensor for spacetime (2.1), by nding the most
general quadratic form in momentum that commutes with the hamiltonian for a scalar, uncharged
particle. it is convenient to use orthonormal frames, with the obvious choice being:

where the li are the left invariant vector elds on su (2). recall that the li generate the right
action and therefore only one of them, l3, is a killing vector eld for (2.1).

the hamiltonian can then be written as:

the computation of {h,k}p b = 0 becomes straightforward. one only has to note that the only
non-trivial brackets come from

{mi,mj}p b =  k

ij mk

,

{pr, r}p b = 1.

(3.5)

notice that the components of k are eectively written in the basis (/t, /r, li), and we assume
only r dependence, since the inverse metric in such basis depends only on the radial coordinate.
under such conditions the most general k commuting with h is found to have the form

k = ag pp + bp2

t + cptm3 + d(m2

1 + m2

2) + em2

(3.6)

where a, b, c, d, e are arbitrary constants.

the result is both simple and enlightening. as should be expected, the metric and the killing
vector elds arise. but the requirement that the terms involving l1 and l2 should have the same
coecient is a non-trivial restriction, which would not exist for the spherically symmetric case. it
can be understood by noticing that only such a sum can be expressed as a sum of products of
killing vectors, namely:

l2
1 + l2

2 = r2

3  l2
3.

1 + r2

2 + r2

(3.7)

hence, we learn that any second order killing tensor we might built is, unlike in the four dimensional
kerr-newman case, reducible. furthermore, it must include the left invariant vector elds in
the combination m2
2, or, equivalently, the right invariant vector elds in the combination
n 2
1 + n 2
i p. since we want to give it an interpretation of generalized total
angular momentum, it seems natural to complete the killing tensor and dene it as:

3 , where ni = r

1 + m2

2 + n 2

k = m2

1 + m2

2 + m2
3.

(3.8)

clearly, it is the casimir invariant of any of the su (2) subgroups of the so(4) rotation group in
four spatial dimensions. these two casimirs coincide for the scalar representation. therefore, the
reduction of symmetry from so(4) to u (2) due to rotation, does not aect the number of constants
of motion (for scalar particles) coming from angular isometries. there will still be three quantum
numbers, associated with the maximal set of commuting operators. this fact will prove useful in
separating variables for the geodesics and scalar eld equations, which can be achieved in a way
similar to the spherically symmetric case.

one can then convert (3.8) back to coordinate basis, nding that its covariant components are:

(4.2)

where h(, , ) = jl + jr + (), and e, jl and jr are three integrals of motion. using further
the hidden symmetry encapsulated in the stackel-killing tensor, we introduce another conserved
quantity, j2, with the dimensions of angular momentum squared, such that

(l1h)2 + (l2h)2 + (l3h)2 = j2.

these equations exhibit the behaviour one would expect for a rotating background. putting the
j, jr and jl to zero, there is no motion in the angles  and , but there is angular motion in ,
corresponding to the dragging of frames caused by rotation. in other words, rotation is not the

14

same as possessing angular momentum, when one deals with a rotating background. moreover,
the dragging changes sign from inside to outside the horizon, which conrms the picture presented
in figure 1. from the t equation, we recover, for  = 0, the usual interpretation that particles
(e > 0) propagate forwards in time and antiparticles (e < 0) backwards. for non-zero rotation,
however, the energy term reverses the usual sign, as we get inside the vls, leading to time travel;
furthermore, a spin-orbit coupling term arises, which, as we show below, conspires to minimise
the time travel eect along a geodesic. notice the singularities on the horizon for the t and 
equations. in what follows these will be shown to be just a failure of coordinates.

4.1 the angular motion and the cliord tori

before discussing the motion in r and t we will say a few words about the motion in the euler
angles. we begin by recalling that s3  su (2) is foliated by tori, called cliord tori, which are
given by  = constant. more specically, the metric on s3 can be written, by dening u = (+)/2
and v = (  )/2, as

ds2 =

(4.10)

1

4(cid:20)d2 + 4 cos2(cid:18) 

2(cid:19) du2 + 4 sin2(cid:18) 

2(cid:19) dv2(cid:21) .

there are two singular leaves corresponding to  = 0 and  = . they are circles. if one uses the
standard round metric on s3, each torus is intrinsically at and in general rectangular. but for
 = /2 the torus is a square torus, and moreover it is a minimal two-surface with respect to the
round metric on s3. if  6= /2 the tori are not minimal submanifolds except for the cases  = 0
and  =  which are circular geodesics

each cliord torus is bred by two sets of circles  = constant and  = constant which spiral
around the tori in opposite senses. they are the orbits of the right or left actions of u (1)  su (2)
respectively. in other words they are the orbits of the self-dual or anti-self-dual hopf brations
respectively. the picture becomes easy to visualize if one performs a stereographic projection from
s3 to e3. the tori are then the same as when using standard toroidal coordinates (figure 2).

4.2 equatorial motions and consistent back reaction

it follows from (4.3) that

j2  j2
r.

(4.11)

equality in (4.11) implies from (4.3) that h depends only on  and hence jl = 0. it then follows
from (4.7) that the motion is conned to the square torus at  = /2 and moreover from (4.8) we
deduce that  = constant. thus the motion traces out a hopf bre on the square cliord torus on
s3. conversely every motion with jl = 0 has this character. these motions, which we will refer to
in the sequel as equatorial, are particularly important. the reason is that the bmpv black hole or
1
time machine has momenta given by (jl, jr) = (0,
2 /(2g5)). it follows that if it absorbs a
particle with jl 6= 0 it cannot remain in the bmpv family of solutions. in fact it must become a
non-bps state. on the other hand if the absorbed particle has jl = 0 then it can remain within
the bmpv family, but with new left angular momentum and mass given by m + e and jr + jr
respectively. in this way we can gain some insight into the back-reaction problem.

4.3 eective potentials

as we discussed in section 2, for a spacetime like the bmpv spacetime one can dene generalized
eective potentials due to the high degree of symmetry. this proves to be a powerful way of
understanding motions in the spacetime. from (4.5) we write

where

case. the jr negative case is simply obtained by the inversion e  e, a reection of the p t
invariance of axisymmetric spacetimes. for r > rl the allowed points in the graphs are either above
or underneath both v + and v . for r < rl they are in between the two potentials.

4.4 analysis of geodesic motions

due to (4.11) we can express jr = sj, where 1  s  1 is dimensionless and j is always positive.
rewriting (4.5) as

(

r4

,

(4.16)

)2 = e2l  2(cid:18)m2 +

4j2

r2 (cid:19) 

the question of how far a freely falling particle can go is rephrased as when does the right
hand side become negative ?. clearly, a massless particle with no angular momentum following
a geodesic will never penetrate the vls. if we are in the over-rotating case it means that it will
never enter the black hole region. a more interesting case occurs if the angular momentum of the
particle is non-zero. we can have jr = 0 or jr 6= 0. in the former case, geodesics will never enter
the time machine, since the rhs of (4.16) will become zero outside the vls. but for the latter
case, the last term (spin-orbit coupling) will contribute, and if the sign of es is negative, there
will be geodesic motions going through the vls. this contribution is maximal when s = 1, which
means that the motion is in the  = /2 plane, i.e. equatorial motions. thus, particles (e > 0)
can only cross the vls if  and s have dierent signs. this can be seen in gures 3 and 4. notice
that the p t counterpart of gure 3 would show the over-rotating case where particles penetrate
the vls.

the above results can be readily understood if we recall the machian dragging of inertial frames
mentioned above. the condition we found, namely that s needs to be negative (for particles and
xing  to be positive), just means the geodesic motions need to have a spin opposite to the
dragging eects of the spacetime. intuitively this is what we would expect. the particles have to
be sent orbiting in the opposite direction to the rotation of the hole, so that the motion becomes
suciently radial as they approach the vls, hence being able to enter it. quantitatively this can
be seen by writing (for equatorial motions):

d(cid:19)2
(cid:18) dr

= e2  m22 (cid:18) 2jr

r

+

e

r3 (cid:19)2

,

d

r(cid:20) 2jr

r3 (cid:21) .

(4.17)

therefore, the radial velocity is highest, at any radial distance, when the (equatorial) motion is
purely radial;
in fact, if we want an orbit without rotation at some radial distance (since for
geodesics it is not possible everywhere) we must compensate the dragging of frames by giving the
particle some angular momentum. we may conclude that the necessary condition for penetrating
the vls (jr should be negative (positive) for the over-rotating (under-rotating) case), may be
interpreted as a requirement on the motion to be suciently radial as it approaches rl.

we now ask if freely falling particles can penetrate the black hole region. for the over-rotating
case it follows from (4.16) that no geodesics will penetrate into the black hole region! this is
quite striking, since according to our denition in section 2 it means that the manifold for r > rh
is geodesically complete, and in fact the maximal analytical extension of the bmpv spacetime.
we will comment more on this below. for the under-rotating case, one has to deal with the usual
phenomenon in black hole physics that the time coordinate t (proper time of the observer at innity)
freezes as one approaches the horizon. this follows from the divergence at rh in (4.6). but it
can be seen that a freely falling test particle reaches the horizon for a nite value of a regular time
parameter. using the v time coordinate as introduced in (2.41), i.e. working in the patch uin

19

(which removes the singularity at r2 =  as long as rl 6= rh), the motion of an observer with no
acceleration will obey:

the ve sign in the  comes from orbits with dr/d < 0, so that the divergent term drops out for
ingoing trajectories, rendering a nite v time for crossing the horizon. for rotating backgrounds,
an additional divergence arises for the  coordinate. one can deal with it similarly, now using the
in coordinate introduced in (2.42). one then nds:

with the negative sign coming from ingoing trajectories. having claried these usual artifact of the
coordinates, we refer to gure 4 which illustrates that particles with positive angular momentum
will be able to enter the black hole region and also the time machine. furthermore, except for
the very special orbit with e = 2j/, all such orbits will bounce back at some radial distance rv.
their motion will now be towards r  , and since they cannot go back to the same asymptotic
region whence they originated, they must leave the patch uin and enter a new outgoing patch uout
containing a new asymptotically at region of the complete bmpv spacetime. therefore the global
structure resembles the extreme reissner-nordstrom or the equatorial plane of the kerr-newman
solution.

4.5 geodesic time travelling

we now turn our attention to particles entering the time machine. the relevant gure is the p t
counterpart of gure 3. clearly, all particles coming from innity with enough energy to overcome
the bump dened by the dashed line will penetrate the vls. what happens to such particles? they
cannot enter the black hole region and, although there are bound states with orbits in rh < r < rl,
a particle coming from innity will not fall into one of these states. hence, all trajectories will come
out again from the time machine region. so we are entitled to ask the question: is the time machine
eective? can a particle come out before (in t time) it went in? from the gure we can see that the
particle crosses the v 0 line, and hence will reach the region where dt/d is negative. so, the overall
t for travelling from the vls inwards and back to the vls will have a negative contribution, and
we now show that t can indeed be negative.

consider radial penetration in the vls, i.e., the  component of the momentum 5-vector, p,
vanishes at rl. then, the ratio jr/e is xed by the second equation in (4.17). furthermore, (4.16)
becomes

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

d(cid:19)2

the radial velocity is therefore maximal at the vls. for massless particles this maximum coincides
with the value at innity. the minimum will be at r = 3rl and, as long as rl is not too close to
rh, namely

rl

rh #0,(cid:18)1 +

," ,

(4.21)

(dr/d)2 will be a positive number everywhere outside the vls, and therefore there will be geodesics
coming from innity and entering the time machine. in terms of the p t counterpart of gure 3,
(4.21) is the condition for the particle to overcome the bump dened by the dashed line, compatible
with the jr/e ratio dened by radial penetration. under such condition, (4.6) reads

dt

(cid:16) rh

r (cid:17)2(cid:21) ,

(4.22)

which is clearly positive on the vls but is always negative (in fact diverges to ) on the horizon.
so, both (dr/d)2 and dt/d have a zero in ]rh, rl[, respectively at rv, rt. to see that rv < rt we
drop the condition of radial penetration and instead parameterise jr as

where the subscript t corresponds to quantities computed at rt. then,

jr =

(4.23)

(4.24)

so we conclude that the region r < rt is allowed if rt is inside the time machine, as shown in the
gure. moreover it is only allowed if rt is inside the time machine. in other words, dt/d can become
negative outside the vls if jr is positive. but that region is never visited by causal geodesics with
jr > 0. this had to be the case, since we know that the light cones do not tip enough outside
the vls to allow time travel of timelike or null geodesics. more specically, for a causal particle
moving in the t  plane, we can write the 5-momentum vector as u = (d/d)/ + (dt/d)/t,
and the causality requirement, u2  0, reads:

r3(cid:17)(cid:19)  0

(4.25)

and it follows that for particles with positive jr, outside the vls, in the over-rotating case we must
have dt/d  0.

in order to provide some physical sensibility. in [24] we will discuss more quantitatively geodesic
time travel, in some simpler spacetimes.

figure 7 gives an illustration of time travelling. the condition jr < 0 for the particle to
penetrate the vls in the over-rotating case is illustrated.
if the particle penetrates, it always
reaches the eective causality horizon, where dt/d = 0. then it moves downwards in our left
diagram. of course, the whole point is that the spacetime causal structure is described by light
cones that tips substantially inside the vls. as the rotation of the spacetime forces the particle
to bounce back to increasing r, it leaves the causality horizon and also the vls. but this happens
before its past image actually entered the vls. the right diagrams represent a constant t foliation
of the left diagram.

one might imagine trying to stop the particle from going in at the moment illustrated in the
second gure on the rhs. the obvious paradox is then how could it emerge in the past? however,
it should be borne in mind that the t = constant hypersurfaces are not cauchy surfaces and the
function t is not a global time function. thus, one cannot specify arbitrary cauchy data on a
t = constant hypersurface. in particular one is not free to choose cauchy data corresponding to
stopping the particle. an analogy would be to consider the problem in standard classical physics,
electromagnetism say, where one would specify the initial data spread out over a non-cauchy
surface, like at dierent times. inconsistencies can then easily be constructed. the dierence is,
obviously, that for the bmpv spacetimes, as in other manifolds with causal pathologies, there is
no partial cauchy surface. the cauchy problem is always ill-dened.

22

4.6 carter-penrose diagrams

a traditional way of exhibiting the causal structure of static spherically symmetric black hole space-
times is by means of two-dimensional carter-penrose (cp) diagrams. for such cases, the cp
diagram encodes all the causal information about the spacetime. but our situation is more compli-
cated and so we must look at extensions of the original examples to a more general construction.
one direction in which one may generalise the concept is just to regard a cp diagram as a
two-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold of spacetime. this is what is done for the kerr
manifold, mk. this solution possesses, in addition to the time translations, just one extra killing
eld, m, generating a circle action. taking the quotient, mk/s1, would give a three-dimensional
space, which is hard to visualize. as an alternative, one may nd two-dimensional totally geodesic
timelike submanifolds, corresponding to equatorial and polar motions. then, two cp diagrams
give some idea of the causal structure, but it is partial. for example, the equatorial cp diagram
does not reveal the existence of ctcs inside the horizon, since these are to be found in the s1
generated by m. in the bmpv spacetime one can nd totally geodesic submanifolds, in the same
sense as for kerr, but for our situation this does not work as well. the success of these diagrams
for kerr is to illustrate the dierence with the charged spherically symmetric case, due to the ring
singularity at r = 0 and the new asymptotical region with negative r coordinate. in the bmpv
case, the singularity is point-like, so that diagram will not carry much new information.

in the case of the taub-nut spacetime, the u (2) isometry group does not act on two-dimensional
orbits, but on three-dimensional orbits. these orbits are s1 bundles over s2, and together with the
radial coordinate one may exhibit the spacetime as an r  s1 bundle over s2 [12]. a cp diagram
may be obtained from the restriction of the metric to the bres. however, the orbits of the s1
time translation action are not orthogonal to the s2 factor.
in fact, the distribution d  t m
spanned by the radial and the time translation vectors is not integrable, and there is, unlike in the
spherically symmetric case, no foliation by two-dimensional leaves, each of which may be identied
with the cp diagram. the integrability property is sometimes referred to as orthogonal transitivity.
the distribution is integrable if and only if the holonomy of the connection valued in the g/h coset
base space is trivial.

in our case, the orbits of the su (2)l isometry subgroup correspond to s3 and the spacetime
may be though of as an r2 bundle over s3, the bre directions being spanned by /r and /t. if
the rotation parameter  vanishes, then we obtain the usual carter-penrose diagram for an extreme
reissner-nordstrom spacetime, but if  6= 0 things are more complicated. the curvature of the
bundle is non-vanishing and the orbits are not everywhere spacelike. writing the bmpv metric as

as in the taub-nut case, the distribution spanned by

theless, the metric (4.28) contains some information about the spacetime. however, it is not even
everywhere lorentzian. it is positive denite inside the vls. this is because, the s3 orbits are
spacelike outside the vls but timelike inside it. this phenomenon does not occur in the taub-nut
case.

the general klein-gordon equation for the family of spacetimes found in [14], of which the bmpv
black hole is a special case, was computed in [15]. however, the x coordinate used therein fails for
the bps case, when the two horizons coalesce, and for such a special case some of the remarks made
in [15] must be changed. so, whereas the equation therein possesses two regular singular points
(horizons) and one irregular singular point (spatial innity), (5.6) possesses two irregular singular
points; at x = 0, i.e. spatial innity, and x = , corresponding to the degenerate horizon. notice
that x ]  ,1] parameterises the inside the black hole; x  [0, +[ parameterises the outside,
and these are the only possible values for x.

the singularity structure of (5.6) shows that the method for nding general solutions of second

order linear odes fails. so we look for solutions of restricted validity.

of rst and second kind (neumann functions) bessel functions,

f =

[+jl+1(u) + nl+1(u)] ,

(5.10)

where  are constants. since the asymptotic equation reveals little more than the dimen-
sionality of spacetime, these results resemble other ve dimensional computations [16, 17].

despite the fact that (5.10) is only valid for large r, it might correspond to large u or small u,
the latter case valid only for small  (rh  r  1). recall that for large and small values
of the argument, the bessel functions can be approximated by, respectively,

incoming wave (incident wave). we are interested in computing the absorption probability.
if we knew the coecients , we could immediately read o the scattering amplitude and
from it deduce the absorption probability by unitarity:

these constants are constrained by regularity requirements. for at space, for instance, (5.8)
would be valid all over spacetime; regularity at the origin would impose  to be zero, and
we would get a scattering probability of one. in other words, ingoing and outgoing waves
would dier only by a phase shift. there would be no absorption (since there is nothing to
absorb) and no information loss. in our case we have to match the solution with a near region
solution to learn more about those coecients.

near horizon region (r2  r2

h  2): in this region we can neglect both the d/x2 term and
the second term of the c coecient in (5.6). it is clear from (5.6) that the behaviour of the
solutions near the horizon (x  ) will be f  expax, hence depending strongly on the

sign of a, which distinguishes the under-rotating from the over-rotating case. the former
possesses oscillating solutions, and hence there will be a ux near the horizon, and indeed
some absorption by the black hole, but the latter possesses either a damping or a divergent
solution on the horizon, which clearly indicates that there will be no ux, and hence no
absorption by the black hole. this constitutes the quantum mechanical counterpart of the
classical result of section 4. notice that is true for all frequencies, including very high for
which the wkb approximation is valid. hence it contains as a particular case the result seen
in the last section for the geodesics. for small frequencies we are also able to give quantitative
details of the absorption process, which we now describe.
by dening 2xa = y, the approximation of (5.6) in the near horizon region can then be put

this is whittakers equation (see e.g.
[18]), and the solutions are the whittaker functions.
these can be expressed in terms of other conuent hypergeometric functions, like the kummer
functions. since 2j+1 is an integer, the general solution can be written as a linear combination
of rst and second kind kummer functions as follows:

f = e y

(5.16)

where  are constants. for a > 0 (over-rotating), 2ax = real(2ax) > 0 as one

approaches the horizon from the exterior. hence, the asymptotic behaviour of m and u for
suciently large x, i.e. suciently close to the horizon, gives rise to the following behaviour
for f (in terms of the x coordinate):

the leading behaviour is the one anticipated above. requiring regularity of the wave function
on the horizon implies + = 0.

for suciently small values of , the near region solution will overlap the far region solution.
in particular, for  = 0, the near region solution actually covers the whole spacetime. if we
choose  suciently small, so that in the overlapping region

we know that near the horizon, the wave functions behave as expit. as usual, we require
the physical solution to be purely ingoing on the horizon, hence choose the  +  sign in the
exponential. this requirement singles out a specic linear combination of the two coulomb
wave functions. as t  , one nds the desired behaviour in the combination

therefore we conclude that + = i. again, for small  obeying (5.18), we can approximate

matching with (5.12) gives  = 0, and hence no absorption and a phase shift similar to the
one obtained in at space, in agreement with the ux method used above.

for the under-rotating case, the variable y becomes purely imaginary, and care must be taken
in computing the asymptotic expansion for the whittaker functions. the most straightfor-

ward way is to replace the change to the variable y by the change t =p|a|x. then, we obtain

whittakers equation for an imaginary argument, which is the coulomb wave equation:

since the coecient of i is real and positive, it can be seen from (5.14) that the scattering
probability is never greater than one; in other words, super-radiant scattering does not occur
for the bmpv black hole, in contrast with four dimensional kerr-newman. this was to be
expected as a consequence of the preserved supersymmetry of this background. notice also
the l factor in the exponent of  which means that the leading order term for the absorption
probability comes from the s-wave.

the absorption cross section is obtained by multiplying the absorption probability by the appropri-

approximates the total cross-section and gives

(5.27)

since b/p|a| is small, the cross-section for small frequencies reduces to

abs  l=0

abs =

areabm p v .

(5.28)

for the massless wave case this generalises the result of [20] for a rotating black hole: the absorption
cross section for the s-wave is still the area of the black hole. this is in agreement with the behaviour
found a long time ago for the four dimensional kerr black hole [22].

as was noted in the original paper [5], and on which we will comment in the next section, the
classical entropy formula for the over-rotating case gives an imaginary quantity and hence becomes
senseless. now, we have seen that in such a case the absorption probabiliy and cross section are
zero. since (5.28) is telling us that abs is a measure of the area in the under-rotating case, these
two results seem to indicate that the eective area and entropy of the bmpv over-rotating black
hole should be considered to be zero. notice, however, that the derivation of (5.28) breaks down
at the critical point.

the above calculation was only valid for small , which for the massless case means small
frequency of the wave. for very high frequencies, one approaches the particle limit, so that the wkb
approximation is justied; in other words, the scattering problem is reduced to the computation
of the radius of capture, rc, for the classical geodesic motions.
in general, the results then
obtained dier from the ones at small frequency, that is, the absorption cross section has a frequency
dependence. for the schwarzchild d-dimensional black hole, the absorption cross section in the
small and high frequency limits are, respectively (for massless spinless particles),

(5.29)

these are areas of spheres; in four dimensions they have radii rh = 2m and 3m respectively.
the latter is the well known radius for the unstable circular orbit sitting on top of the potential
for null orbits in the schwarzchild spacetime. for the extreme reissner-nordstrom solution, the
formula for low frequencies is the same, but for high frequencies becomes

high =

(5.30)

for the four dimensional case this corresponds to the area of a sphere of radius 2m = 2rh and
for the ve dimensional case a sphere of radius 3rh . in the bmpv case, one can compute rc by

29

using the potentials (4.13). specializing to equatorial motions, and dealing with the particle case
(the antiparticle is analogous), it then follows that one has to consider two cases: particles with
an angular momentum component jr with the same or opposite sign to , the black hole rotation
parameter. it is straightforward to verify that rc will be given by the largest solution of the cubic
polynomial equation

(5.31)
with + and  corresponding respectively to jr positive or negative. the trigonometric solution
is more useful than the usual cardanos solution and yields

arccos (cid:18) rl

(5.32)

respectively. thus, for rl = 0, i.e., no rotation, we get rc = 3rh, in agreement with the above
remarks for an extreme reissner nordstrom geometry. naturally, this case is not sensitive to the
angular momentum of the particle. turning on the rotation, however, the behaviour depends on
the sign of jr. as rl increases from 0 to rh,

rc decreases f rom r = 3rh to rh f or jr > 0,
rc increases f rom r = 3rh to 2rh f or jr < 0.

(5.33)

the result is readily interpreted from the analysis of section 4. the dragging eect facilitates
the fall into the black hole of particles with the opposite angular momentum from that of the
hole (jr < 0). hence the radius of capture becomes larger. the opposite reasoning holds when
particle and hole have the same sign of angular momentum. it then follows that the absorption
cross section for high frequency scalar waves obeying the relation j = jr, in the under-rotating
bmpv spacetime is

high = 22vuut 2rh cos" 1

3

arccos (cid:18) rl

rh(cid:19)3!#!6

(5.34)

in terms of figure 4, the radius of capture corresponds to the extreme of the potentials outside the
horizon: for jr > 0 the maximum of v +; for jr < 0, the minimum of v  (which is the maximum
of v + in the p t counterpart of gure 4). clearly, this analysis is only valid for the under-rotating
case. for the over-rotating we know that the absorption cross section is zero. in fact, for jr > 0,
we see from gure 3 that v + has no bump outside the horizon, which corresponds to the non
existence of a positive real zero for equation (5.31). for jr < 0, we would be looking at the p t
counterpart of gure 3. then, there is a minimum for v  outside the horizon, but this cannot
be seen as measuring any eective region for absorption since no particles will be captured by the
black hole.

6 thermodynamics - the particle/tachyon analogy

the usefulness of the bmpv spacetime for practical time travel seems to be extremely limited.
firstly because it is a ve dimensional spacetime. secondly, because as for an ordinary extreme

30

reissner-nordstrom black hole, the third law of thermodynamics seems to prevent the formation
of such a bps spacetime from a non-extreme one, by means of a nite process. the inability
to form the innite throat (which is also to be found in the bmpv spacetime) under any nite
process is one way to understand it. this would represent the classical argument to explain why
we could not construct the stable naked time machine we have described above. one could also try
to explore quantum inconsistencies in forming such manifold from a causally well behaved initial
conguration. however, arguments along the lines of [7] do not seem to apply, due to the singular
nature of the under-rotating spacetime, which seems to be an inevitable passage point in order to
achieve the over-rotating one. other lines of reasoning, as in [23], nd no application in our case
either, since our scalar eld computation seems to show that scalar eigenfunctions would exist even
for the naked time machine spacetime. we will not persue this investigation in this paper, but,
nevertheless, we would like to give a simple thermodynamical argument presenting some evidence
that the passage from the under to over-rotating spacetime is forbidden.
it relies on a simple
analogy that can be drawn between the behaviour of the under-rotating or over-rotating bmpv
black holes and, respectively, an ordinary particle and a tachyon.

for an ordinary relativistic particle, the energy relation e =pm2 + p2 yields a rst law of

thermodynamics of the type:

.

(6.1)

de = v.dp +(cid:18) 1

4mi(cid:19) da

8

we have dened the area as a = 16m2
i , where mi is the irreducible mass, which coincides with
the rest mass for the particle, and  is the usual lorentz contraction factor. the 3-velocity and
the 3-momentum appear as conjugate variables and we can dene the susceptibility  by

p2(cid:19)mi
 =(cid:18) 2e

=(cid:18) v
p(cid:19)mi

=

m2

(m2 + p2)

,

3
2

(6.2)

which vanishes as p  . the susceptibility measures how receptive the system is to change
the velocity due to a change in momentum, under a reversible process. the fact that it vanishes
just means that the velocity approaches asymptotically the speed of light, as can be seen by the
standard relation:

v =

.

(6.3)

p

pm2 + p2

notice that unlike the velocity, the energy is not bounded and diverges as we take p  . but
both energy and velocity increase as we increase p. for the latter this is encoded in the positivity
of .

the mechanical relations for a tachyon can be obtained by replacing m  im. the modulus of
the 3-momentum becomes constrained to take values in ]m, +[, and the susceptibility becomes
negative. hence, as we give more momentum to the tachyon, it slows down, approaching asymp-
totically the velocity of light (from above) as p  . on the other hand, as it approaches the
minimum value for momentum its velocity diverges. notice, however, that just as for an ordinary
particle, the energy always increases with p.

now consider the kerr black hole. the area of the intersection of the future event horizon with

some partial cauchy surface is

a = 8(m 2 +pm 4  j 2).

case, the susceptibility, which is now (h/j)mi
thus h tends asymptotically to a nite value, namely (2mi)1. but dierently from the particle
case, there is now a bound on the possible values of j; it must be in ]0, 2m2
i ]. for higher j, (6.4)
with a xed mi has no real solution for m . therefore, the maximum allowed value for h is
slightly smaller than the asymptotic value: (22mi)1. this corresponds to the angular velocity
of an extremal kerr black hole.

for the bmpv black hole, the area of the future event horizon is

where j is the angular momentum of the spacetime (up to a constant). we now dene the irreducible
mass by

(6.7)

where the last equality denes the constant . the irreducible mass is dene as to coincide with
the mass for a ve dimensional schawrzchild black hole (as can be seen from (2.5)). the rst law
for a reversible process takes the form

d =

2j

32  j2 dj,

(6.8)

where the coecient of dj should be interpreted as , an averaged angular velocity of the spacetime
and not the angular velocity of the horizon, which in fact is zero. (we remark that unlike the kerr
metric, the bmpv spacetime is not rigidly rotating.) it follows from (6.8) that  is greater, equal
or smaller than 1, for the over-rotating (|j| > ), critical (|j| = ) or under-rotating (|j| < ) cases,
respectively. for a xed mi we can express  in terms of  only:

under-rotating case (|j| < ) - there is a lower bound on  for a given mi, given by the square
root in (6.8), 3  , beyond which it is impossible to satisfy (6.6). since  = (/j)mi
,
|j| increases as  increases. hence we can see that as |j|  ,   1, i.e., approaches the
angular velocity for a critically rotating spacetime. therefore, an under-rotating black hole

32

cannot become an over-rotating black hole by means of a reversible process, in analogy to
the impossibility of a particle to overtake the velocity of light. moreover, the susceptibility is
indeed always positive, for positive  and the allowed values of .

slightly over-rotating case ( < |j| < 3) - the immediate problem seems to be that the

area becomes imaginary, and so does the entropy. but this is just a manifestation of the
fact that a t=constant section of the horizon is no longer a spacelike hypersurface. in fact,
the usual derivation of thermodynamical results breaks down, since the spacetime has a vls
outside the horizon. but let us still analyse a process of constant area (which is now an
imaginary number) as being a reversible process. the values of  and  are given by (6.9)
and (6.10) by taking  to be negative. for this slightly over-rotating case,  still increases
with |j|. the lower bound on  is now 3 > /2, so that the susceptibility is negative for all
allowed values. hence, in complete analogy with the tachyon case,  is always bigger than
one, but it decreases, approaching one asymptotically, as we increase the angular momentum
of the spacetime.

strongly over-rotating case (|j| > 3) - the value of  decreases with increasing |j|. fur-

thermore,  is bounded by 0 < 3 < /2, for which values the susceptibility is positive. this
has no analogue in the previous cases.

7 conclusions

in this paper we have discussed several issues concerned with the ve dimensional solution found
by breckenridge, myers, peet and vafa. the new features of this solution are the co-existence of
supersymmetry and a non-trivial angular momentum for the spacetime. furthermore, to the best
of our knowledge, it provides the rst example of a supersymmetric solution with trivial topology
describing, for some values of the parameters, a naked, totally non-singular time machine. this
led us to review the notions of time functions, time coordinates and develop a general framework
for stationary spacetimes admitting a s1 action, which we did in the rst section. we furthermore
reviewed the notion of gravito-magnetism and introduced the notion of the sagnac connection.
such ideas will been more deeply scrutinised in [24]. there we show, in some well-known examples
of rotating spacetimes, how the computation of the landau levels on r2, h2 or s2 is equivalent to
the the study of the klein-gordon eld in particular spacetimes. these spacetimes are such that
r2, h2 or s2 arise as spacelike hypersurfaces orthogonal to the timelike killing vector eld, and
the sagnac connection provides the magnetic eld on the riemann spaces. we also note that for
the cases where spacetime can be seen as a lie group, a simple group theoretical argument exists
reproducing the same computation.

in order to understand thoroughly the structure of the bmpv spacetime we studied the geodesic
equations, which can be completely separated due to the large isometry group. for this purpose, the
eective potentials were exhibited. the existence of a reducible stackel killing tensor was discussed
in section 3, and the analysis of geodesic motions was done in section 4. two interesting features
arise at this classical level: the dragging eects associated with the rotation and the geodesic time
travel eects. the latter are allowed by the fact that the orbits of u (1) subgroups of the isometry
group become timelike. it is non-trivial, however, that even inertial observers can experience time

33

travel. in fact, the condition that freely falling motions can penetrate the vls induces an eect
against geodesic time travel. such condition is interpreted in terms of the dragging eects. we use
this example to state clearly the problem associated with most spacetimes with causality violation:
the inexistence of a cauchy surface does not allow a well dened cauchy problem. interpreting
time travel in terms of particle/antiparticle creation or annihilation events, as in gure 7, seems
quite appealing. but it is not quite clear as yet how far one can push such interpretation.

the global structure can be read from the study of the geodesics. we have drawn the carter-
penrose diagrams, but emphasised the subtleties and the limitations of such devices for non spheri-
cally symmetric manifolds. particularly interesting is the behaviour that an over-rotating spacetime
is found to possess. from the viewpoint of causal geodesic motions, a timelike boundary for the
spacetime is created at r = rh. one is then tempted to think along classical lines: the strong rota-
tion creates enormous centrifugal forces which prevent fall into the black hole. such an argument
misses, however, two points. firstly, what one classically thinks of as centrifugal forces is encoded
in the j2/r2 term present in the potentials, whereas the relativistic corrections, namely the term
coming from the sagnac connection, are what actually supports the repulson eect. secondly, it
is non-trivial (and related to the previous point) that bmpv spacetimes with this repulson eect
coincide with the ones possessing ctcs outside r = rh. the issue of understanding the behaviour
of charged causal particles (and waves) in the bmpv spacetime will be addressed in [24].

the repulson-like behaviour for the over-rotating manifold is conrmed in section 5 by study-
ing the klein-gordon eld on the bmpv background. furthermore, it is shown not to be a
peculiar behaviour of high frequency waves, but in fact present for all frequencies. the study of
an uncharged scalar eld on the under-rotating background follows a standard prescription. the
outcome generalises for bmpv spacetimes the well known result that the absorption cross section
for low frequencies coincides with the area of the hole. for high frequencies we use the wkb
approximation to derive the cross section. as one should expect, abs depends on the angular
momentum of the wave. this is due to the spacetimes dragging eects.

the theories of gravity available at the moment possess solutions which seem to allow dis-
placement both forwards and backwards in a timelike direction. this is true not only for general
relativity or supergravity but also for non-standard gravity theories (for a large list of references see
[25]). classically, there seems to be no general argument as why one should discard such solutions.
quantum mechanics seems to be more promissing as a chronology protector.
if string theory,
as the most successful quantum theory of gravity so far, has something to say about causality
violations, the supersymmetric bmpv time machine may prove to be a very useful laboratory.
