abstract

we study classical solutions of n = 4 super yang-mills theories that are invariant
under 1/4 of the supersymmetry generators. expressions for the mass and electric
charge of the congurations are derived as functions on the monopole moduli space.
these functions also provide a method of determining the number of normalisable
bosonic zero modes.

introduction

the realisation of eld theories as the low-energy world-volume dynamics of congu-
rations of branes in type ii string theory and m-theory has led to simple geometrical
explanations of many eld theoretic phenomena. the archetypal example is that of
n = 4 super yang-mills which is the world-volume theory of d3-branes. on the
coulomb branch, (p, q) strings stretched between each pair of d3-branes correctly
reproduces the expected eld theory spectrum of electric, magnetic and dyonic 1/2-
bps states [1]. for three or more d3-branes however, there exists the possibility
of suspending between them networks of (p, q) strings constructed from three-string
junctions [2].
if the d3-branes are planar then such networks preserve 1/4 of the
space-time supersymmetry [3, 4, 5] and correspond to dyonic 1/4-bps states of the
yang-mills theory [6, 7] thus leading to a much richer spectrum of bps states than
previously suspected for gauge groups of rank greater than one. the distinctive
signature of such states is that the magnetic and electric charge vectors are not par-
allel [8, 6]. these states persist at weak coupling in the eld theory where they are
amenable to standard semi-classical analysis and, in particular, one expects classical
solutions with non-parallel magnetic and electric charges to exist.

the equations of motion governing such 1/4-bps congurations consist of the
usual monopole bogomolnyi equation, together with a second order equation for an
adjoint scalar eld derived from gauss law. explicit solutions to these equations
were rst given in [9, 10] using a spherically symmetric ansatz. for the special case
of the (1, 1) dyon of su(3) gauge group, solutions have also been found using nahm
data [11]. moreover, as we shall review below, the authors of [11] also demonstrated
that the space of gauge invariant 1/4-bps solutions with given magnetic charge is
determined by the moduli space of 1/2-bps monopole solutions of the same charge.
these monopole moduli spaces have been studied extensively in the past and many
of their properties are understood [12]. however, although the existence of 1/4-bps
solutions can be shown, little else is known about these congurations. in particular,
neither the mass nor electric charge can be determined without an asymptotic solution
to gauss law.

in this note, we derive an expression for both the mass and electric charge of
1/4-bps states as a function over the monopole moduli space. the former is shown
to be equal to the norm squared of a particular killing vector on the moduli space.
we demonstrate this technique using the (1, 1) dyon of su(3) as an example and
reproduce the results of [11]. finally, we discuss the moduli space relevant to the
low-energy dynamics of these 1/4-bps states. the existence of non-normalisable
zero-modes means this space diers from the moduli space of solutions. we use the
expression for the electric charge to determine the number of normalisable bosonic
zero modes. as this work was completed, the preprint [13] appeared, where the
number of normalisable bosonic zero modes is also calculated, togther with the nor-

1

malisable fermionic zero modes.

bogomolnyi equations

we start by reviewing the derivation of the bogomolnyi equations [8, 10, 11] in n = 4
super yang-mills theories with arbitrary simple gauge group, g. it is simple to show
[11] that preservation of 1/4 supersymmetry requires four of the scalar elds to vanish,
reecting the fact that the corresponding bps string network is planar. our starting
point is therefore the theory with only two real adjoint scalars and the congurations
we discuss will also be solutions of the theory with n = 2 supersymmetry. the
bosonic hamiltonian reads,

h = 1

2trz d3x n(ei)2 + (bi)2 + (d01)2 + (d02)2 + (di1)2 + (di2)2  e2[1, 2]2o

where i = 1, 2, 3 is a spatial index and e is the yang-mills coupling constant. as
usual, the bogomolnyi equations are derived by completing the square. dening,

a = cos  1  sin  2
b = sin  1 + cos  2

for some angle , the hamiltonian may be rewritten as,

h = 1

= 1

2trz d3x n(ei  dia)2 + (bi  dib)2 + (d0a)2 + (d0b)2
 e2[a, b]2 + 2eidia + 2bidibo
2trz d3x n(ei  dia)2 + (bi  dib)2 + (d0a)2

+ (d0b  ie[a, b])2 + 2i (aei + bbi)o

 a  q + b  g

(1)

(2)

where q and g are the electric and magnetic charges respectively. both are vectors
of dimension r = rank (g). the vacuum expectation value (vev) of a is taken to lie
in the cartan subalgebra, hai = a  h, with a similar expression for b. converting the
last two terms of the rst line of (2) to surface integrals requires use of the bianchi
identity, dibi = 0, together with the equation of motion for a0, usually referred to
as gauss law,

diei = ie[a, d0a] + ie[b, d0b] .

(3)

the inequality (2) is saturated by time-independent solutions (0 = 0) with the time-
component of the gauge eld given by a0 = a and the remaining gauge elds and
adjoint scalar, b, determined by the usual bogomolnyi equation,

bi = dib .

2

(4)

finally, gauss law requires the adjoint scalar, a, to obey,

d2a  e2[b, [b, a]] = 0 .

(5)

maximising the hamiltonian bound (2) with respect to the parameter  yields the
equality a  g = b  q. this equation is automatically satised by any solution to (4)
and (5) as can be seen by a simple integration by parts.

when the electric charge vector, q, is parallel to the magnetic charge vector, g,
the resulting conguration is a dyon solution which breaks 1/2 of the supersymme-
try generators. the spectrum of such states has been exhaustively investigated over
the past few years. when the electric and magnetic charge vectors are not parallel
however, the conguration breaks 3/4 of the supersymmetry generators [8]. such con-
gurations correspond to three-string junctions [6, 7] and determining the spectrum
of states in the eld theory remains an open problem.

solutions to (4) have been studied in great detail. the vev b selects r simple
roots1, a, a = 1, . . . , r. topological considerations require the magnetic charge
a, for integers
na. the moduli space, mg, of gauge independent, purely magnetic solutions with

vector to be a linear combination of the co-roots: g = (4/e)pa na
magnetic charge, g and mass b  g, has dimension m = 4pa na [14]. let x p, p =

1, . . . , m, denote coordinates on mg. tangent vectors are identied with zero modes,
(pai, pb), given by solutions to the linearised bogomolnyi equation together with a
suitable gauge xing condition, taken to be background gauge,

ijkdjpak  dipb + ie[pai, b] = 0

dipai  ie[b, pb] = 0 .

(6)

the overlap of zero modes denes a natural, complete, hyperkahler metric on mg
given by,

gpq = trz d3x (pai qai + pb qb) .

(7)

a subset of these zero modes are generated by bosonic symmetries of the vacuum
which are broken by the monopole conguration, specically translational, rotational
and global abelian gauge symmetries. it is simple to see that each of these broken
symmetries results in an isometry of the metric gpq and the corresponding zero modes
are killing vectors. of particular interest will be the h  min(m/4, r) isometries
generated by large gauge transformations of the form

g.t.ai = di

;

g.t.b = ie[b, ]

(8)

1we assume b lies strictly within a weyl chamber. this is stronger than the usual requirement

that the gauge group is broken to its maximal torus

3

where the gauge parameter  does not tend asymptotically to zero but to some el-
ement,   h, of the cartan subalgebra. such deformations automatically solve the
linearised bogomolnyi equation but are zero modes only if they simultaneously sat-
isfy the background gauge xing condition (6). this requirement is recognised as
equivalent to the equation of motion for the adjoint scalar a (5). the existence of a
unique zero mode for each element of the cartan subalgebra broken by the monopole
conguration ensures a unique solution to (5) for each vev a [11]. therefore, mg is
also the moduli space of 1/4-bps dyon congurations.

a potential on the monopole moduli space

in summary, for xed value of , and xed magnetic charge g, there exists a one-
to-one correspondence between solutions to (4) describing purely magnetic congu-
rations and solutions to (4) and (5) describing 1/4-bps dyons. however, the electric
charge, and therefore the mass, of the 1/4-bps dyon congurations remains undeter-
mined. in general, these quantities are given by a function over mg. one method
to determine this function is to explicitly solve equation (5), at least to lowest order
in the radial spatial coordinate, r. the two equations bi = dib and ei = dia en-
sure the asymptotic behaviour of b and a encodes the magnetic and electric charges
respectively,

b = b  h  g  h/4r + o(1/r2)
a = a  h  q  h/4r + o(1/r2)

(9)

for general monopole congurations, determining even the asymptotic form of a is
dicult. however, there exists a simple formal expression for both quantities in terms
of the monopole moduli space metric (7). we start with the electric contribution to
the mass,

a  q = trz d3x i (aei) = trz d3x i (adia)

= trz d3x (cid:16)(dia)2  e2[a, b]2(cid:17)

(10)

where we have used the equation of motion (5). as in the previous section, we can
make progress by considering the subset of zero modes of the bogomolnyi equation
that arise from large gauge transformations and the corresponding killing vectors on
mg. denote as   kp the components of the killing vector on mg that is gener-
ated by the gauge transformation (8) that asymptotes to   h. consider then the
transformation with gauge parameter  = a, which is a zero mode courtesy of (5).
expanding in a basis of tangent vectors, we have,

g.t.ai = dia = (a  kp)pai
g.t.b = ie[b, a] = (a  kp)pb

4

which, after substitution into (10) above, gives the promised expression for the electric
contribution to the mass of the 1/4-bps dyon as the norm squared of a killing vector
on mg,

a  q = gpq(a  kp)(a  kq)

(11)

this potential was rst derived in the context of three-dimensional constrained in-
stantons in [15]. the killing vector a  kp is tri-holomorphic and curiously a sigma
model with such a potential is of the form required to realise up to eight supercharges
[16]. however, as is discussed in the nal section, this model cannot be relevant to
the low-energy dynamics of 1/4-bps states as it would result in a time dependent
electric charge, q.

finally, the expression for the electric charge may be derived in a similar manner.

repeating the manoeuvres that led to (10), we have,

  q = trz d3x (cid:16)didia  e2[, b][a, b](cid:17)

(12)

for arbitrary vector . once again expanding in tangent vectors, we nd

q = gpq(a  kp) kq .

an example: the (1,1) su(3) dyon

a simple, but trivial, use of the potential (11) is in describing 1/2-bps dyons, even
for su(2) gauge group. in this case, the potential is constant over the moduli space
and can be easily shown to be equal to the mass dierence between the monopole
and dyon.

the simplest non-trivial application of the potential is in the description of 1/4-
bps congurations in an su(3) gauge group. the vev b selects two simple roots,
labeled  and . monopole congurations with magnetic charge g = (4/e) or
g = (4/e) are known as fundamental. both sectors have 4 zero modes and
monopole mass given by m1 = (4/e)b   and m2 = (4/e)b  . the potential on
the monopole moduli space is always a constant and the resulting electric charge of
any dyon is necessarily proportional to the magnetic charge.

in order to construct a 1/4-bps conguration, we must consider the magnetic
charge charge sector g = (4/e)( + ). purely magnetic solutions to (4) have
mass m1 + m2 and an eight-dimensional moduli space generically of the form [17, 18]

m(1,1) = r3 

r  mt n

z

the r3  r factor is parametrised by collective coordinates ~x, corresponding to
spatial translations, and  corresponding to a global gauge transformation. the

5

corresponding metric is at,

ds2

f lat = (m1 + m2)d~x2 +

1

m1 + m2

d2 .

the factor mt n is taub-nut space and can be thought of as describing the relative
separation, ~r, and relative phase  of a pair of distinct fundamental monopoles. the
metric on this space is given by,

ds2

t n =  1 +

2(m1 + m2)

m1m2r ! d~r +

(m1 + m2)2

4m2

1m2

2  1 +

2(m1 + m2)

m1m2r !1

(d + cos  d)2

where  has period 4, ensuring the metric has no singularity at the origin. the
discrete identication z acts as (, ) = ( + 2,  + 4m2/(m1 + m2)). if the ratio
m1/m2 is rational,  becomes periodic and the r factor collapses to s1.

a natural basis of gauge transformations in the cartan subalgebra is given by

q1  h =

2
3

(2 + )  h ;

q2  h =

2
3

( + 2)  h

both of which are integer valued and between them generate the two killing vector
elds / and / on m(1,1). the specic linear combination of charges which
generate each isometry can be determined by an analysis of the low-energy dynamics
of 1/2-bps congurations and is given by [17, 18],

q =

m1q1 + m2q2

m1 + m2

;

q =

1
2

(q1  q2)

notice that these two isometries of mg are not generated by orthogonal gauge trans-
formations, a fact related to the non-compactness of the r factor of m(1,1). we are
now in a position to determine the electric charge of the 1/4-bps dyon solutions.
decomposing a in terms of the two generators above gives

a =

the electric charge of the conguration is now simply determined given the two non-
parallel components a  q and b  q = a  g. after a little algebra we nd,

the rst term is common to all dyons, including those preserving 1/2 supersymmetry.
the second term is non-zero only for 1/4-bps dyons where q, an order parameter
for the breaking of the extra supersymmetry generators, is explicitly given by,

q =

(13)

this expression for the electric charge of a (1, 1) dyon as a function on the monopole
moduli space was also obtained by lee and yi [11] (see equation (3.11) of this refer-
ence) using a dierent technique.

although we have determined the potential only in the simple case of the (1, 1)
dyon, several features will persist for general magnetic charges. from (13), we see
that at the point r = 0 of m(1,1) the electric charge is proportional to the magnetic
charge and the dyon preserves 1/2 of the supersymmetries. a similar situation occurs
for any conguration with g = (4/e)k for some root  and integer k. the relevant
monopole moduli spaces contain the su(2) monopole moduli spaces of charge k as
a submanifold of xed points of the relative u(1) isometries. the corresponding
congurations are simply the usual 1/2-bps dyons that exist for complex higgs elds
[19]. for g not proportional to a root, the isometries have no xed points and there are
no 1/2-bps solutions. as r  , q approaches a limiting value. the asymptotic
forms of all monopole moduli spaces are known [20] and such behaviour is generic
and is related to the instablity of the string network [11].

normalisable zero modes

in this nal section, we comment on the dynamics of the classical 1/4-bps congura-
tions which, at low-energies, should be describable in a moduli space approximation.
locally, the moduli space of 1/4-bps dyon solutions of magnetic charge g is given by
s1  mg, where the s1 factor refers to the  parameter introduced in (1). the vev
b, and therefore the metric on mg, varies with . moreover, at specic points b may
cross the wall of a weyl chamber and the dimension of mg will change discontinously.
naively, one expects the low-energy motion to be restricted to surfaces of constant
electric charge on mg. to see how this arises, consider the natural metric describing
1/4-bps dyon dynamics,

gpq = trz d3x (pai qai + pb qp + pa qa)

7

which diers from the usual monopole metric (7) by the addition of the overlap of
zero modes of a satisfying,

d2pa  e2[b, [b, pa]] = 2ie ([pai, dia]  ie[pb, [b, a]])

from the asymptotic form of the scalar elds (9), we see that any zero mode of
a which induces a change in the either the vev, a, or the electric charge, q, is
non-normalisable and the component of the metric gpq in this direction diverges. as
expected therefore, motion on the moduli space of solutions is restricted to surfaces of
constant  and q and the number of normalisable bosonic zero modes is equal to the
dimension of surfaces of constant electric charge. this is simple to determine given
the expressions for q derived previously. for each of the h abelian gauge symmetries
broken by the dyon conguration, there exists a function q on the monopole moduli
space (12). with the exception of bq = ag, all of these functions vary independently
over mg. the surface of constant electric charge is therefore given by the intersection
of h  1 level surfaces and generically describes a submanifold of mg of dimension
m  h + 1. this result was also derived in [13] using similar methods. these authors
further determine the number of fermionic zero modes to be given by 2m  4h + 4.

in the example of the (1, 1) dyon considered in the previous section, m = 8 and
h = 2 and the number of bosonic and fermionic zero modes is 7 and 12 respectively.
in this case the latter are all generated by broken supersymmetry transformations
while the former consist of all collective coordinates on m(1,1) with the exception of
the relative separation, r. the appearance of an odd number of bosonic zero modes
however should give us pause. on general grounds, one would expect the low-energy
eective action describing dyon motion to reect the four supercharges preserved
by the classical congurations. such a sigma model requires a kahler target space.
the number of normalisable zero modes derived above therefore appears to be in
contradiction with the dictates of supersymmetry. further, without a supersymmetric
eective action, it is unclear how semi-classical quantisation could produce the correct
multiplet struture of 1/4-bps states. clearly a resolution of these issues is required
before further progress in determining the full bps spectrum of n = 4 gauge theories
can be made.
