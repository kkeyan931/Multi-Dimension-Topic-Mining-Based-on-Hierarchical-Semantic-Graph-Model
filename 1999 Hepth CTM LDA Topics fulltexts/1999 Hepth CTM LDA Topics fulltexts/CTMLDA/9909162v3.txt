introduction

in the early days of string theory, one way to obtain amplitudes for the scattering of an arbitrary number of
strings was by using the factorization property, what means that the scattering amplitude of n strings may be
interpreted as the scattering amplitudes of a smaller number of strings sewn together. this made it possible to
build the n string scattering amplitude by knowing the expression for three string scattering amplitudes. even
though they were very ingenious and successful, those calculations didnt take into account the ghost structure
of the vertices, and that is what is done here.

in [1], it was shown how to sew tree vertices without ghosts using the group theoretic approach to string
theory [2] in order to obtain a new, composite vertex. following the same procedure, we shall calculate the
scattering amplitude of n strings taking account the ghost structure.

we shall start with a short review of how to sew tree vertices without ghosts. what we must do is sew two
legs of two vertices, one leg from each vertex. what we have in the beginning are two vertices v1 and v2 with
n1 and n2 legs, respectively (gure 1).

we now sew leg e from v1 with the adjoint of leg f from v2. what we have now is the substitution of
the two sewn legs by a propagator (gure 2). when this propagator is written in parametric form, it is an
integration of one of the variables (in order to cancel one spurious degree of freedom) and a conformal factor
p which contains terms of lns acting on leg e only.

figure 2: sewn vertices.

so the resulting vertex vc (called the composite vertex) has the generic form

where the hermitian conjugate of v2 is for the sewn leg f only and

vc = v1p v 
2 ,

p = z dx p

(1)

(2)

where x is a suitable variable. in what follows, we shall often write p instead of p , calling attention to the
integration when necessary.
when the two vertices are sewn together, we identify legs e and f . we also identify the koba-nielsen
variable ze with one of the koba-nielsen variables of vertex v 
2 , and the koba-nielsen variable zf we identify
with one of the koba-nielsen variables of vertex v1. in [1], this identication is made in the following way:
ze may be identied with zf 1 or zf +1, and zf may be identied with ze1 or ze+1. so there are four
possible combinations: a) ze = zf 1 , zf = ze1; b) ze = zf +1 , zf = ze+1; c) ze = zf 1 , zf = ze+1; d)
ze = zf +1 , zf = ze1.

2 oscillator case

the two original vertices satisfy some overlap identities and so shall do the composite vertex. one particular
overlap identity is given by considering the operator qi with conformal weight d = 0 dened by [2]

qi(i) = 



xn=

n6=0

n

n (i)n + i

.

where i

n are bosonic oscillators with commutation relations

the overlap identity is given by

[i
[i

n , aj
0 , aj

m ] =  ijn,m , n, m 6= 0 ,
n ] = 0 , n .

v hqi(i)  qj(j)i .

identities are. first, by the denition of qi, we have that

qi(i) = qi(i) = qi(i) .

so, the adjoint of the overlap equations is given by

because we are considering the adjoint of leg f in vertex v2, we must see what the adjoint of these overlap

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

hqi(i)  qj(j)i v  = 0 .

we now take the overlap identity considering the eects of the operator qi(i) on the vertex v1 on a

generic leg i and on leg e1 (gure 3):

1as we shall be seeing soon, this form of the overlap will not lead to the correct composite vertex in the case where the cycling

transformations of the legs that are not sewn involve the sewn legs e or f .

2

figure 3: overlap identity for v1.

v1hqi(i)  qe(e)i = 0 .

we may then insert the unit operator 1 = pp 1 and multiply by p without altering the result:

v1pp 1hqi(i)  qe(e)i p .

(9)

(10)

since the conformal operator p acts only on leg e, it will have no eect on qi(i). in order to compute the
eect of p on qe(e), we must know that, for a conformal transformation v acting on a conformal operator
r(z) of weight d,

since qe(e) has conformal weight d = 0, we have

dz (cid:19)d
v r(z)v 1 = (cid:18) dv z

r(z) .

and (gure 4)

p 1qe(e)p = qe(cid:16)p 1e(cid:17) ,

figure 4: overlap identity for v1p.
v1phqii  qe(p 1e)i = 0 .

(11)

(12)

(13)

the second term in the expression above is facing now leg f of vertex v 

2 , or best, its hermitian conjugate.
considering that the hermitian conjugate of qi (given by (7)), we then have the following overlap identity
between legs i and f :

we can then make a cycling transformation in order to obtain the correct factor for an arbitrary leg j (j 6= f )
of vertex v 

2 . the only term that will be aected is the term depending on leg f :

v1phqi(i)  qf (p 1f )i = 0 .

(14)

v 1

j vf qf (cid:16)p 1e(cid:17) v 1

f vj = qj(cid:16)v 1

j vf p 1e(cid:17) .

(15)

doing this, the overlap identity for the composite vertex vc (gure 5) can be written as

figure 5: overlap identity for vc.

3

vchqi(i)  qj(v 1

j vf p 1e)i = 0 ,

(16)

which is the overlap equation between two arbitrary legs i and j of the composite vertex vc.

but the overlap identity for the composite vertex, since none of legs i or j involves the propagator, must

be given by

vchqi(i)  qj(j)i = 0

and so in order for the equation we have obtained for the overlap of the composite vertex vc to be true we
must have

vf p 1v 1

e = 1  p 1 = 1v 1

f ve

which implies that the propagator is given by

p = v 1

e vf  .

in order to give an explicit expression for the propagator, we will now choose i to be of the form

i = v 1

i

z = z  zi .

(18)

(19)

(20)

this choice is called the simple cycling [1] and it is the one that simplies our calculations the most. in this
choice, the propagator is given by

(17)

(21)

or in terms of the le

n operators2,

pz =

+ zf  ze ,

p = e(zf ze1)le

this form works for all choices for the composite vertex discussed before3. the true propagator is given by

expression (22) integrated over a suitable variable. choosing this variable to be s = zf  ze, we then have

p =z 0

, s = zf  ze .

(23)

before going any further, we must discuss another aspect of the theory that depends on the particular
way in which the legs are identied during the sewing procedure. let us consider the more general case of an
arbitrary cycling vi. this kind of cycling may depend on other coordinates that are not zi. as an example, let
us suppose that we are identifying coordinate ze of leg e with coordinate zf 1 of vertex v 
2 and coordinate
zf of leg f with coordinate zf 1 of vertex v1. the overlap identity between legs i and e  1 on vertex v1 is
(24)

v1hqi(cid:16)v 1

0i z(cid:17)  q(e1)(cid:16)v 1

0(e1)z(cid:17)i

where we are calling v 1
the cycling transformation on leg j (j = 1, . . . , n ). these cycling transformations
0j
may depend on the other legs. as an example when this happens, we take another choice of the cycling
transformations i that is not as trivial as (20) but gives a simpler formula for the propagator. this choice is
given by [1] [3]

2other forms for this propagator are given by [1]:

i = v 1

(zi+1  zi1)

which is the transformation that takes zi1, zi and zi+1 to , 0 and 1, respectively. its inverse is given by

v0iz =

zi1(zi  zi+1)z + zi(zi+1  zi1)

(zi  zi+1)z + (zi+1  zi1)

.

(26)

in the case of the cycling given by (25), the cycling for leg e  1 will depend on leg e, which is not present

in the composite vertex. on this vertex, the overlap between leg e  1 and an arbitrary leg j reads

this overlap equation involves terms that depend on leg e, which is non-existent in the composite vertex vc.
the correct overlaps should be given by

where the cycling transformations v 1
do not depend on legs e or f . so, in order to restore the
correct cycling transformation for the composite vertex, a conformal transformation must be made on the
cycling transformations on vertex v1. these are given by
v 1
0j  c1v 1

j 6= e ,

(29)

where

c1 =

(30)

in this denition, we consider implicit that the transformation v 1
on leg e will not be part of the composite vertex and so need not be modied.

e v0e = 1 since the conformal transformations

considering the general case, we have that the overlap equation for v1 (gure 6) that will lead to the correct

composite vertex is now obtained from the original overlap

figure 6: overlap identity for v1.

where 0i = v 1

0i z and 0e = v 1

0e z. by inserting conformal transformation (30), we obtain (gure 7)

v1hqi(0i)  qe(0e)i = 0 ,

inserting now the propagator, we obtain (gure 8)

(37)

and we expect the composite vertex to have a dierent form (given shortly) than in (1) in order to amount
for the contributions of the conformal transformations. the second term of the overlap is now facing leg f of
vertex v 

2 so that we have the following overlap between legs i and f :

we are now facing the conformal transformation cf

v1c 1

1 phqi(i)  qf (p 1e)i = 0 .

which is necessary in order to change 0f  f . introducing this transformation we obtain (gure 9)

cf = v 1

f v0f

making a cycling transformation from leg f to leg j, we then obtain (gure 10)

once again, a conformal transformation must be introduced because of the cycling transformations v 1

so that we now have (gure 11)

(39)

the composite vertex must be dened in terms of the new cycling transformations and so it must now

include the conformal transformations that perform this change. so, it will now be dened by

vc = v1c 1

considering this, the overlap identity for the composite vertex vc can be written as

since the correct overlap identity for the composite vertex is given by

we must have

(44)
for the cycling transformation (25), it is only necessary to do conformal transformations on legs e  1, e,
e +1, f 1, f and f +1, depending on the particular way the variables associated with these legs are identied
with the variables associated to legs e and f . in this particular example (which is case a seen before), the
conformal transformations are given by

given by formula (40). we shall do it by verifying the eect of c1 on vertex v1. in order to do this we need

i.e. the eect of c1 on vertex v1 is to change v 1
and v0j  vj thus eliminating the dependence of
the cycling transformations of every leg except leg e on the latter. the same can be done to obtain the eect
of conformal transformation c2 on vertex v 
2 , with the same results. so, the eect of these transformations is
to eliminate from the cycling transformations of the composite vertex all dependence on the sewn legs e and
f .

introduction of ghosts

we now introduce ghosts in the vertex so that what we must sew now are two vertices with some ghost variables
attached to them, i.e. we will be considering the physical vertices [4] which have the correct ghost number.
in this case, in addition to satisfying the overlap identities with the conformal operator qi, the two physical
vertices and the composite vertex must also satisfy some overlap identities with the conformal operators bi and
ci, given by [4]

bi(i) =

where ci

n and bi

from (80) we can see that there will be an anomalous term in the ci overlap of the physical vertex u unless
both legs i and j are precisely those legs (a, b or c) that do not have any ghosts attached to them. these ghosts
which are attached to all the other legs are responsible for the anomalous terms.

3.1 analysis of the ghost number

before going any further, it is necessary to make some considerations on the ghost number of the composite
vertex. as we shall see shortly, in the case where we perform the sewing with ghosts included, using the physical
vertices, the resulting composite physical vertex will not have the correct ghost number unless we insert some
extra ghosts in vertex u1 before the sewing takes place. considering this, we shall dene the composite vertex
to be given by

uc = u1gp u 
2

(81)

where g are some extra ghosts that will be introduced in order to make vertex uc have the correct ghost
number and p is the propagator (in its integrated form).

10

we must now analyze the ghost number of the composite vertex and of its parts in order to calculate the
ghost number that the extra ghosts g must have. in order to do this, we shall use the ghost number operator
ngh. for a vertex with n legs, the ghost number operator is dened by

n gh =

n

xi=1



xn=1

ci
nbi

n 



xn=2

bi
nci




n
 .

(82)

the reason why the ghost number operator is a sum from i = 1 to i = n is because there are n vacua that will
annihilate the operators corresponding to each one of them. when acting on the physical vertex, this operator
gives a ghost number n , what is the correct ghost number for a tree vertex with n legs.

in the case of the composite vertex, it has n1 + n2  2 legs (because it does not have legs e and f , which
have been sewn together) and so it must have ghost number (n1 + n2  2). for this vertex, the ghost number
operator n gh

can be divided into two parts:

c

n gh

c = n gh

1 + n gh

this ghost number operator will have the following eect on the composite vertex:

the fact that uc has ghost number n1 + n2  2 then implies that
e i = g ,

hg, n gh

1 + n gh

i.e. the extra ghosts that must be introduced in vertex u1 must have ghost number 1. 6

there is an innite number of combinations of ghosts that have ghost number 1. we could have any linear
combination of ghosts of the type b, bcb, bcbcb, etc. but it will prove to be simpler to choose g to be a
combination of bs only so that we may represent it as

where i
n are the coecients of the linear combination. in order to determine the correct linear combination,
we must use some other conditions, like brst invariance of the scattering amplitude. this we shall see next.

g =

xi=1



xn=

i
nbi
n

(98)

3.2 brst invariance

we must now impose that the scattering amplitude obtained from the composite vertex is brst invariant and
check whether this condition is strong enough to determine g. the scattering amplitude [1] is obtained by
acting with the composite vertex

(99)
on a certain number of physical states (|1i|2i . . . |ni) and then by integrating over all variables zi (i =
1, . . . , n1 + n2; i 6= e, f ):

uc = u1gp u 
2

w = z

n1+n2

yi=1

i6=e,f

dzi u1gp u 

2|1i|2i . . . |ni .

(100)

p is the propagator in its integrated form and g are the extra ghosts to be inserted in u1.

the action of the brst charge q on this scattering amplitude is given by

(101)

6this contrasts with references [5] and [6] where it is claimed that the extra ghosts should have ghost number 1, 2 or 3, depending

on the way one chooses legs e and f to have or not to have ghosts attached to them.

12

the rst and third terms will result in total derivatives that give zero when one integrates over some variables
[1] and so what remain are just the second and third terms.

the commutator p is given by a pure conformal transformation, and it is a function of the generators
n (n = 1, . . .) only. as the brst charge commutes with all le
le

n s, i.e.

we have

considering now that

we then have, for g given by (98),

(103)

(104)

(105)

in order for the scattering amplitude w to be brst invariant, expression (105) must be zero or a total
derivative (that can be integrated out to become a null surface term). at the same time, we want these extra
ghosts to place (talking in terms of the simple cycling) a ghost on one of the legs in u1 that do not have any
ghosts attached to them. if we now remember property (76), we see that we can satisfy these constraints in a
nice way by choosing g to be given by

g = (1)n1+a

n1

xj=1



xn=1

eaj
n bj
n

(106)

where a (a 6= e) is one of the legs of vertex u1 that does not have ghosts attached to it. inserting these ghosts
in vertex u1, we have

what is a total derivative that will vanish when one does the integration over za.

in references [5] and [6], the extra ghosts have been placed in the propagator. although this can be done,
there is no way one can derive a formula for the ghosts in the propagator for a general cycling. in that case,
the extra ghosts must be derived and brst invariance has to be checked for each particular cycling. also, the
resulting composite vertex obtained in that case is not similar in its ghost structure to an ordinary tree vertex,
although it has the correct ghost number.

3.3 overlap identities

we must now use the overlap identities to determine the propagator that satises them. in order to do this
we shall start with vertex u 0
which involve leg e.
considering equations (79) and (80), the overlap identities for vertex u 0
1 between an arbitrary leg i and leg e
are given by (gure 12)

1 , which is the vertex with cycling transformations v 1

the extra ghosts must then be inserted in vertex u 0

them through the overlaps we obtain (gure 13)

at this point, we must introduce conformal transformations of the type of c1, given by (30) in order to
have at the end the correct cycling transformations for the composite vertex. in order to do this we need to
use matrices enm(), dened by [5]

enm() =

1

(m + 1)!

which have the following properties:

1

m+1

zm+1 "(z)n+1(cid:18) 

z

z(cid:19)1#(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=0

ert(1)ets(2) = ers(12) , r, s, t = 1, 0, 1 ,



xt=1
ern() = 0 , r = 1, 0, 1 , n  2 ,
xp=1
xp=2

enp(1)epm(2) = enm(12)

enp(1)epm(2) = enm(12) , n, m  1 ,

(114)

(115)

(116)

(117)

(118)

enr(1)ers(2)sm , n, m  2 .

the action of the operator c1 on the ghosts bi

n can then be calculated in the following way: rst we write

n in terms of an integral over the conformal operator bi
bi

n(i)

bi

n = i0i=0

d0i (0i)n+1bi(0i) .

then we insert the operator c1:

c1bi

1 = i0i=0
nc 1

d0i (0i)n+1(cid:18) d

d0i

v 1

i v0i0i(cid:19)2

bi(cid:16)v 1

i v0i0i(cid:17) .

after a change of variables i = v 1

i v0i0i we have7

c1bi

1 = ii=0
nc 1

di (cid:16)v 1

0i vii(cid:17)n+1(cid:18) d

di

v 1

0i vii(cid:19)1

bi(i) .

using matrices enm(), we then may expand 0i in terms of i. if we also expand bi(i), we then obtain

c1bi

nc 1

1 =



xm=1



xp=ii=0

di enm(v 1

0i vi)(i)m+1bi

p(i)p2 .

performing the integration we then have

1 =



xm=1

enm(v 1

0i vi)bi

m .

(119)

(120)

(121)

(122)

(123)

using (123) in equations (111) and (113) and multiplying (111) by (di/d0i)2 and (113) by di/d0i, we

then have (gure 14)

7note that, because i is a polynomial in 0i (with no constant term), then 0i = 0  i = 0.

way as in the case with no ghosts. but now we must take extra care since there are terms depending on be
the second term of equation (125). using equation (123) as a guideline, we have

the operators of the overlap equations are now facing leg f of vertex u

operators:

equations (143) and (147) are the overlap identities between legs i and f .

in order to obtain the overlaps between leg i of vertex u1 and an arbitrary leg j of vertex u 

2 , we must
now perform a cycling transformation that will take the operators from leg f to leg j. the eect of this

transformation on cf (cid:16)p 1v 1

e vii(cid:17) is

0f vf p 1e!1

then, we must also write

so that we must insert these ghosts into the expressions for the overlaps. before doing that, we must notice
that the extra ghosts acting on vertex v 0

we can see that, for each case, the composite vertex has the correct ghosts number (n1 + n2  2).

4 conclusions

using overlap identities, two vertices were sewn together in order to become a composite vertex. the calcula-
tions have been done with the correct ghost numbers for each vertex and the result has both brst invariance
and the correct ghost counting.
