abstract

an exact solution of domain wall junction is obtained in a four-
dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric u(1)  u(1) gauge theory with
three pairs of chiral superelds which is motivated by the n = 2 su(2)
gauge theory with one avor perturbed by an adjoint scalar mass. the
solution allows us to evaluate various quantities including a new central
charge yk associated with the junction besides zk which appears already
in domain walls. we nd that the new central charge yk gives a negative
contribution to the mass of the domain wall junction whereas the central
charge zk gives a dominant positive contribution. one has to be cautious
to identify the central charge yk alone as the mass of the junction.

introduction

in recent years, there has been an intensive study of domain walls which appear in many areas
of physics. these domain walls interpolate between degenerate discrete minima of a potential and
spread over two spatial dimensions. this situation arises naturally in four-dimensional n = 1
supersymmetric eld theories [1][3] in addition to condensed matter physics. in supersymmetric
unied models, domain walls can be formed during thermal evolution of our universe and often
provide signicant and interesting constraints on model building. on the other hand, it has been
found that domain walls in supersymmetric theories can saturate the bogomolnyi bound [4].
such a domain wall preserves half of the original supersymmetry and is called 1/2 bps state
[5]. it has also been noted that these bps states possess a topological charge which becomes a
central charge z of the supersymmetry algebra [6] [1].

recently another interesting possibility for a bps state has attracted much attention [7][10].
domain walls occur in interpolating two discrete degenerate vacua in separate region of space. if
three or more dierent discrete vacua occur in separate region of space, segments of domain walls
separate each pair of the neighboring vacua. if the two spatial dimensions of all of these domain
walls have one dimension in common, these domain walls meet at a one-dimensional junction.
the solitonic conguration for the junction can preserve a quarter of supersymmetry. it has also
been found that a new topological charge y can appear for such a 1/4 bps state [7] [8] [10].

there have been general considerations of junctions [7] [8] as well as more concrete numerical
results [9]. in spite of these eorts, no exact or explicit solution has been obtained so far for the
bps junctions. in order to make progress in understanding these solitonic objects, it is quite
useful to have exact solutions which allows us to investigate closely the behavior of these solitons
and to evaluate explicitly the central charges y besides z. in this respect, an exact solution
oers informations complementary to general considerations and numerical studies.

the purpose of our paper is to present an exact solution of domain wall junction with three
distinct vacua in a eld theory model and explicitly work out various properties of the soliton
including the new central charge y as well as the central charge z. we believe that this is the
rst exact analytic solution of the bps domain wall junction. the model is a simplied toy model
simulating the n = 2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills theory with one avor which is explicitly
broken to n = 1 by giving a mass term to the adjoint chiral supereld. the central charge z is
a two-dimensional complex vector which is determined by dierences of superpotential at three
distinct vacua. we give a formula which explicitly expresses the energy of the domain walls and
junctions in terms of the central charges z and y . we nd in our model that the central charge
y has a simple geometrical meaning of the 2 times the triangular area in eld space which is
enclosed by three domain walls connecting three distinct vacua at innity. we also nd that the
main contribution to the mass of the domain wall junction conguration comes from the central
charge z and the negative y is merely an additional small negative contribution. our result gives
a warning to a naive identication of the central charge y alone to be the mass of the junction.

junctions and central charge

2

using the convention of ref.[11], we denote the left-handed and right-handed supercharges
of the n = 1 supersymmetric four-dimensional eld theory as q, q  .
if the translational
invariance is broken as is the case for domain walls and/or junctions, the superalgebra in general
receives contributions from central charges [1], [6][8], [10]. the anti-commutator between two
left-handed supercharges has central charges zk, k = 1, 2, 3

{q, q} = 2i(k 0)

zk.

(1)

the anti-commutator between left- and right-handed supercharges receives a contribution from
central charges yk, k = 1, 2, 3

{q, q } = 2(

 p + k

 yk),

(2)

where p,  = 0,   , 3 are the energy-momentum four-vector of the system. hermiticity of
supercharges dictates that the central charges zk are complex, and that yk are real: (yk) = yk.

these central charges come from the total divergence and are non-vanishing when there are
nontrivial dierences in asymptotic behavior in dierent region of spatial innity as is the case
of domain walls and junctions. therefore these charges are topological in the sense that they
are determined completely by the boundary conditions at innity. for instance, we can compute
the anticommutators (1), (2) in the general wess-zumino models with arbitrary number of chiral
superelds i and arbitrary superpotential w . the contributions to the central charges from
bosonic components of chiral superelds are given by

zk = 2z d3x kw (a),
yk = iknmz d3x kij n(ajmai),

123 = 1,

(3)

(4)

where the scalar component of the i-th chiral supereld i is denoted as ai and the kahler
metric kij  = 2k(a, a)/aiaj is obtained from the kahler potential k. we see that the
central charge zk is completely determined by the dierence of values of the superpotential w
at spatial innities where dierent discrete vacua are chosen for dierent directions. since single
domain wall has a eld conguration which is nontrivial only in one dimension, one can see
from eq.(4) that the central charge yk vanishes whereas the central charge zk is non-vanishing.
the central charge yk can be non-vanishing, if the eld conguration at innity is nontrivial in
two-dimensions. this situation occurs when three or more dierent vacua occur at innity as is
the case for the domain wall junctions.

to examine the lower bound for the energy due to the hermiticity of the supercharges, we
consider a hermitian linear combination of operators q and q with an arbitrary complex two-
vector  and its complex conjugate   = () as coecients

k = q +   q .

(5)

3

we treat  as c-numbers rather than the grassmann numbers. since k is hermitian, the
expectation value of the square of k over any state is non-negative denite

hs|k 2|si  ( 1,  2, 

1, 

2) k 2

 0.

(6)

the equality holds if and only if the linear combination of supercharges k is preserved by the
state |si. since we are interested in eld congurations at rest, we obtain p k = 0, (k = 1, 2, 3)
and the matrix k 2 in terms of the central charges zk, yk and the hamiltonian h explicitly

k 2 =

hh + y3i
hy1 + iy2i
hz2 + iz1i
hiz3i

hy1  iy2i
hh  y3i
hiz3i
hz2  iz1i

.




(7)

for simplicity, let us assume that eld conguration is two-dimensional, for instance, depends
on x1, x2 only. then we obtain hz3i = hy1i = hy2i = 0. the inequality (6) implies in this case
that for any  and any state

hhi 

| 1|2 + | 2|2(cid:26)(| 1|2  | 2|2)hy3i + re(cid:2)( 1)2hz2  iz1i(cid:3)
+ re(cid:2)( 2)2hz2 + iz1i(cid:3)(cid:27).

(8)

(9)

the minimum energy is achieved at the larger one of vanishing eigenvalues of the matrix k 2

det( k 2) = (hh + y3i2  |hiz1  z2i|2)(hh  y3i2  |hiz1  z2i|2) = 0.

thus the bps bound becomes hhi  max{hi, hii} where hi and hii are two solutions of eq.(9)
(10)
the corresponding eigenvectors are given by  1 =  1hiz1 + z2i/|hiz1 + z2i|,  2 =  2 = 0 for
hhi = hi and  1 =  1 = 0,  2 =  2hiz1 + z2i/|hiz1 + z2i| for hhi = hii .

hi  |hiz1  z2i|  hy3i, hii  |hiz1  z2i| + hy3i.

if hi > hii, then supersymmetry can only be preserved at hhi = hi and the only one

combination of supercharges is conserved

(cid:18)q1 + hiz1 + z2i
|hiz1 + z2i|

q 1(cid:19)|bpsi = 0.

(11)

if hii > hi, then supersymmetry can only be preserved at hhi = hii and the only one combi-
nation of supercharges is conserved

(cid:18)q2 + hiz1 + z2i
|hiz1 + z2i|

q 2(cid:19)|bpsi = 0.

4

(12)

these cases correspond to the 1/4 bps state. if two eigenvalues are degenerate hi = hii, we
can have 1/2 bps state at h = hi = hii where both two combinations of supercharges (11) and
(12) are conserved.

the condition of supercharge conservation (11) for h = hi applied to chiral supereld i =

(ai, i, f i) gives after eliminating the auxiliary eld f i

where complex coordinates z = x1 + ix2, z = x1  ix2, gauge covariant derivatives d, dz =
2(d1 + id2) and dz = 1

vector supereld in the wess-zumino gauge v = (v, , d) gives after eliminating the auxiliary
eld d

v23 = v02,

(14)

where v  v  v and ej is the charge of the eld aj. a similar condition holds in the
case of non-abelian gauge group.

similarly the condition of supercharge conservation (12) for h = hii applied to chiral super-

eld gives after eliminating the auxiliary eld

2ikij  hiz1  z2i

|hiz1  z2i|dzai =

the bps condition (12) applied to u(1) vector supereld in the wess-zumino gauge gives

v12 = d =

v03 = 0,

v01 = v31,

v23 = v02.

(15)

(16)

these bps conditions (13) and (14) for h = hi and (15) and (16) for h = hii ensure that the
conguration is bps saturated.

since hzki and hyki are given by total divergence as shown in eqs.(3) and (4), they are xed
by boundary condition at spatial innity. therefore the boundary condition determines which
of the supercharges can be preserved (11) and/or (12).

since the bps states are the minimum energy solution for a given boundary condition at
innity, they are stable against any uctuations preserving the boundary condition. the domain
wall has the minimum energy and is stable as long as two dierent vacua occupy the order r
region of boundary of large radius r. the domain wall junction has also the minimum energy
and is stable provided the three (or more) vacua remain in regions of order r .

the model

there are many eld theory models which have bps domain wall or junction solutions. first
example is the wess-zumino model of single chiral scalar eld  with a polynomial superpotential

5

w = 2 1
n+12nn+1, where n is an integer  2 and  is a parameter with the dimension of
mass. this model has n discrete supersymmetric vacua with vanishing vacuum energy. therefore
one can have domain wall solutions for n  2 [1], and the junction solutions for n  3 [6]  [8],
interpolating among those vacua. numerical studies have been performed for domain walls and
junctions in these models [9]. however, no explicit analytic solution has been found even for
domain walls, apart from the simplest case of n = 2 where a kink solution has been known for
sometime. no explicit solution has been found for more dicult problem of junctions.

another example is the n = 1 supersymmetric qcd with nf avor of quarks in the funda-
mental representation. for the case of su(nc) gauge group, it has nc  nf discrete supersym-
metric vacua [12], and can have domain wall solutions [1][2]. this model can also be obtained
from the n = 2 supersymmetric qcd by perturbing with a mass term for the adjoint chiral su-
pereld. it reduces to the n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory in the innite mass limit, whereas
it ends up at the singular points of moduli space of the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory in
the limit of vanishing adjoint mass [13]. the moduli space of the n = 2 su(2) supersymmetric
yang-mills theory has two singularities where monopole or dyon becomes massless respectively
[13]. in order to discuss the model in a simpler setting, kaplunovsky et. al. have proposed a
toy model which can be treated as a local eld theory [3]. they introduced two pairs of chiral
superelds m, m and d, d simulating the monopole, anti-monopole and the dyon, anti-dyon of
the seiberg-witten theory respectively. instead of the modulus u of the seiberg-witten theory,
they introduced a linearized analogue t as a neutral chiral supereld. the gauge group was
chosen as u(1)  u(1) simulating electric and magnetic gauge group and the quantum number
of these chiral superelds are given by

u(1)
u(1)

m m d d t
1 1 0
0
0
1 1
1 1 0

(17)

to mimic a massless monopole at t =  and a massless dyon at t = , they consider a
superpotential
(18)
where the coupling parameter h2 replaces the eect of the mass for the adjoint chiral supereld.
their model has two discrete n = 1 supersymmetric vacua

w = (t  )m m + (t + )d d  h2t,

t = +, m m = h2,
t = , d d = h2,

|m| = | m|, d = d = 0,
|d| = | d|, m = m = 0.

(19)

for simplicity, they assumed that the kahler metric of the model is at and discussed the domain
wall solution interpolating between the two vacua. for the special case of h2 = 22, they obtained
an analytic solution of the domain wall which asymptotes to the vacuum at t = + for x  
and to the other vacuum at t =  for x  + of (19):
1 + e2x ,

1 + e2x , d = d =

t =  tanh x.

m = m =

they also studied the domain wall for general values of the coupling h2 6= 22 numerically and
found that the qualitative features are unchanged.

if we add a single avor of quarks in the fundamental representation in the n = 2 su(2)
gauge theory, we obtain three singularities in the moduli space. for large bare mass of the
quark, the additional singularity corresponds to the situation where the eective mass of quark
vanishes, whereas the z3 symmetry among three singularities is realized in the limit of vanishing
bare quark mass [13]. these three singularities become three discrete vacua of n = 1 gauge
theory when perturbed by the adjoint scalar mass [14]. in view of these features, we extend the
u(1)u(1) model of ref.[3] by adding an additional pair of chiral superelds q, q corresponding
to the quark and anti-quark

q q
1 1
0
0

u(1)
u(1)

(21)

to make the quark massless at t = m where m is the bare mass parameter for the quark q, the
superpotential is extended as

w = (t  )m m + (t + )d d + (t  m)q q  h2t.

(22)
this simple modication produces a model which possesses three distinct n = 1 supersymmetric
vacua and allows us to obtain an exact solution for junctions. since the action is invariant under
the three global u(1) transformations

m  ei1m,

m  ei1 m, d  ei2d,
we can choose the vacuum conguration to be

d  ei2 d, q  ei3q,

q  ei3 q,

vac.1 : t = m, q = q = h, m = m = d = d = 0,
vac.2 : t = , m = m = h, q = q = d = d = 0,
vac.3 : t = , d = d = h, q = q = m = m = 0.

(23)

(24)

we will consider a eld conguration which is static and translationally invariant along x3
direction. we assume that the three dierent vacua are realized in dierent directions at spatial
innity in x1, x2 plane.

the solution

the states which are saturated by the bogomolnyi bound obey the eqs. (13) and (14) or the
eqs. (15) and (16). for simplicity, we now choose the eqs. (15) and (16). the bps equation (16)
for u(1)  u(1) vector superelds can be satised trivially by v = 0 and d = 0. the other
bps equation (15) becomes

2kij 

ai
z

= 

.

(25)

 the z3 symmetric case of the vanishing bare quark mass in the seiberg-witten theory yields a dierent
charge assignment for the third singularity (nm, ne) = (1, 2) instead of (nm, ne) = (0, 1) [13]. even if we use this
charge assignment for the q eld, the vanishing d term condition gives the same result.

w 

aj ,  = i hiz1 + z2i
|hiz1 + z2i|

we will look for a solution of this partial dierential equation. we observe that the phase of 
can be absorbed by a rotation of eld conguration, since the bps equation (25) is invariant
under a phase rotation :   ei, z  eiz. later, we will check that the solution satises
hii > hi.

since we assume a canonical kahler metric kij = ij, the bps eqs. (25) become for our

(29)

arbitrary complex parameters h and  can be obtained from real-positive h and  by these
phase changes. therefore we shall take h and  to be real-positive in the following without loss
of generality. the bps condition d = 0 yields |m(z, z)| = | m(z, z)|, |d(z, z)| = | d(z, z)|, and
|q(z, z)| = | q(z, z)|. inspired by this condition, we wish to nd a solution assuming

m(z, z) = m(z, z), d(z, z) = d(z, z), q(z, z) = q(z, z).

and that all of them are real-positive in the entire complex plane. we shall see that this ansatz
gives a consistent solution.

we note that the model acquires a z3 symmetry if we choose the bare mass m of q as

m = i3.

(30)

in order to obtain the exact analytic solution of the domain wall junction, we specialize to this
case, and shift the eld t as t  = t  i 1

(43)

now we will examine the solution more closely. the domain wall separating vacua i and
j is characterized by a normal vector directing from i to j which is expressed as a complex
number of unit modulus ij. if the dierence of the superpotential w (vac.i) at the vacuum i
and w (vac.j) at j is denoted as wij = w (vac.j)  w (vac.i), the integral form of the bps
equation gives the condition on the direction of the domain walls as [8]



wij

ij = 1.

(44)

to orient the domain wall separating the vacuum 2 and 3 along the negative x2 axis, we choose
 = 1. the modulus of the eld t  is plotted as a function of x1 and x2 in fig. 1 where we
can recognize three valleys corresponding to three domain walls.

let us rst examine the boundary conditions at spatial innity |z|  . from eqs. (42) and

secondly, let us examine the asymptotic behavior along the region between two neighboring

thus we recover the exact solution of domain wall (20) with x replaced by x1. by the z3
symmetry, we also obtain respective exact domain wall solutions at the asymptotic region x1 =
3x2 correctly.

finally let us evaluate the central charges hzki and hyki and check hii > hi to conrm that
this solution is indeed realized as a 1/4 bps state. since these charges are determined solely by
the boundary condition at spatial innity (45), we evaluate them on a large cylindrical region
with a disk of large radius r (r  1) centered at z = 0 and a height x3. field congurations
on the surface of the large cylinder approaches a step-function across domain walls. we nd

hz1i = 123rx3,

hz2i = i123rx3,

hy3i = 232x3,

with corrections suppressed exponentially as r  . therefore we obtain
hi = |hiz1  z2i|  hy3i = 232x3,
hii = |hiz1  z2i| + hy3i = 243rx3  232x3.

we see that hii > hi conrming the correctness of the choice of the bps equation (15). it is
interesting to observe that hii is larger than hi primarily due to the dierent phases of hz1i
and hz2i and not to the presence of hy3i 6= 0 term. this is in contrast to the case of a single
domain wall where hi = hii since hz1i and hz2i have the same phase factor and hy3i = 0. in
fact we observe in eq.(48) that the contribution of hy3i to the mass of the domain wall junction
is actually negative. to see this fact from another viewpoint, let us consider the central charge
hy3i further. the general formula (4) for the case of many chiral superelds can be partially
integrated as

y3 = z dx3 iz d2x (cid:2)1(cid:0)ki2ai(cid:1)  2(cid:0)ki1ai(cid:1)(cid:3) = z dx3 ii kidai,

(49)

where ki  k/ai and the last integral in the eld space should be done as a map from a
counter clockwise contour in the z plane. in our case, we have contributions to hy3i from the
eld t only, since eq.(4) clearly shows that elds with real values do not contribute. moreover
the kahler metric in our case is trivial and the counter clockwise contour in z is mapped to a
counter clockwise contour in the eld t . therefore we obtain

y3 = z dx3 (2)z d(ret )d(imt ) = z dx3 (2)32,

(50)

where the integration region in the eld space t is the equilateral triangle whose vertices are
the three vacuum eld values. we see that the central charge hy3i has a simple geometrical
meaning of the 2 times the triangular area in eld space which is enclosed by three domain
walls connecting three distinct vacua at innity. from this consideration, we again nd that the
central charge hy3i should be negative and does not have a naive meaning of junction mass.
let us also note that the domain walls correspond to straight lines in eld space in our simple
model. for general models, it has been shown that lines corresponding to domain walls are not
straight lines in eld space ai, but become straight lines if mapped to the complex plane of
superpotential w (ai) [8], [9]. therefore the geometrical meaning of the central charge hy3i in
general situation (49) is that it is proportional to the area in eld space spanned by the elds as
measured by the kahler potential [8].

let us emphasize that the central charge hy3i has a simple geometrical meaning and is negative
in our model. the main contribution to the mass of the domain wall junction conguration
comes from the central charge zk and the negative hy3i is merely an additional small negative
contribution. this result is not an artifact of our choice of the bps equation (15) rather than the
other possibility (13). if we choose the other bps equation, we merely obtain the reected domain
wall junction solution x1  x1, x2  x2. the solution in fact gives a positive hy3i, but it also
accompanies a dierent formula for the mass of the conguration hhi = hi  |hiz1z2i|hy3i
in (10) where the central charge hy3i contributes negatively to the mass. therefore the nal
physical result is identical.

when we complete writing our paper, more new works appeared on domain walls and junc-

tions [15].

 this fact seems to be against previous thoughts such as in ref.[7].
