abstract

we construct non-standard interactions between exterior form gauge elds by gauging
a particular global symmetry of the einstein-maxwell action for such elds. further-
more we discuss generalizations of such interactions by adding couplings to gravitational
chern-simons forms and to elds arising through dimensional reduction. the construc-
tion uses an appropriate tensor calculus.

introduction

exterior form gauge elds ap = (1/p!) dx1. . . dxpa1...p generalize naturally the elec-
tromagnetic gauge potential and are therefore interesting on general grounds in the
context of gauge theories.
in particular they play a substantial role in supergrav-
ity models and string theory. it is therefore natural to study consistent interactions
of such gauge elds, both the interactions between themselves and their couplings to
other elds.
in this paper we construct non-standard interactions of exterior form gauge elds. this
is done in curved spacetime, i.e. the coupling to the gravitational eld is included as
well. our starting point is the einstein-maxwell action for a p-form gauge eld ap
and an (n  p  1)-form gauge eld anp1 in n-dimensional spacetime (for arbitrary
p and n). this action has a global symmetry which shifts ap by the hodge dual of
the eld strength of anp1, and anp1 by the hodge dual of the eld strength of ap
(with an appropriate sign factor, see below). we gauge this global symmetry, using
an additional 1-form gauge eld v = dxv. this yields inevitably interactions which
are non-polynomial in the v. it would therefore be cumbersome to construct these
interactions in a pedestrian way via the standard noether procedure.
instead, we
employ an appropriate tensor calculus which is analogous to the one introduced in [1]
in at four-dimensional spacetime. by formulating this tensor calculus in the dierential
form language we simplify the construction considerably as compared to the formulation
in terms of components used in [1].

1

the resulting interactions can be generalized in several ways. we shall describe two such
generalizations arising in gravitational theories: (a) additional couplings of p-form gauge
elds to gravitational chern-simons forms; (b) couplings to additional vector gauge
elds and scalar elds arising by standard kaluza-klein type dimensional reduction.
our work is linked to recent progress in four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theo-
ries, and theories with exterior form gauge elds in general. to our knowledge, gauge
theories of the type constructed here appeared for the rst time in [2]. there four-
dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories were constructed in which the cen-
tral charge of the vector-tensor multiplet is gauged. this central charge is a global
symmetry of the type described above and therefore the models found in [2] contain
interactions of the same non-standard type as those we shall obtain. further four-
dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories of the same type were constructed
in [3]. the vector-tensor multiplet with gauged central charged is believed to arise in
n = 2 heterotic string vacua [4]. interactions of the type studied here may therefore
be relevant in that context, among other things.
independently of these developments related to the n = 2 vector-tensor multiplet,
models of the type considered here, and generalizations thereof, were discovered in [5]
(along with further new interactions of exterior form gauge elds) within a systematic
classication of possible consistent interaction vertices of exterior form gauge elds.
four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric versions of some of these models were con-
structed in [6]. our work thus adds to the list of new gauge theories in these references.

the basic model

the properly normalized einstein-maxwell action for ap and anp1 is

s0 =

1

2 z (cid:2)()(p+1)(n1) dap  dap + ()p(n1) danp1  danp1(cid:3) .

(1)

here we use the following conventions for a p-form p and its hodge dual:

p =

1
p!

dx1 . . . dxp 1...p

 p =

1

p!(n  p)!

dx1 . . . dxnp 1...nnp+1...n ,

where indices are raised with the inverse metric g, and the curved levi-civita tensor
is dened by (x1 labels the time coordinate)

12...n = 

g , g =  det g .

one should of course add the einstein action to s0, which however we shall not write
explicitly.
s0 has among others a global symmetry generated by

ap =  danp1 , anp1 = ()n(p+1)  dap .

(2)

2

the corresponding noether current, written in dual notation as an (n  1)-form, is

j =  dap  danp1 .

(3)

we remark that the global symmetry  and its current j are non-trivial, see comments
at the end of the paper.
we will now try to gauge this symmetry. to do this, we search for a modied generator
, such that ap and anp1 transform covariantly under gauge transformations

ap = g ap ,

anp1 = g anp1 ,

(4)

where  is an arbitrary scalar eld and g a coupling constant of mass dimension 1.
a reasonable ansatz is to replace the exterior derivative in (2) with a covariant one. let
us therefore introduce a connection 1-form v with the standard transformation law

and a covariant derivative

v = d

d = d  gv  ,

where  is the covariant version of (2),

ap =  danp1 , anp1 = ()n(p+1)  dap .

(5)

(6)

(7)

these equations give the action of  only implicitly because d involves . we now
determine the covariant derivatives dap and danp1. starting with the former, we
have

dap = dap  gv  danp1

= dap  gv (cid:2)danp1 + ()n(p+1)g v  dap(cid:3) .

using the identity

(v  p) = ()np iv p ,

iv = v 



(dx)

,

(8)

which holds for any p-form p (where v  = gv), this gives

dap = dap  gv  danp1  g2v iv dap .

to solve for dap, we have to invert the operator 1 + g2v iv . with (v iv )2 = v v v iv ,
it is easily veried that

(1 + g2v iv )1 = 1  g2e 1v iv , e = 1 + g2v v ,

and we obtain

dap = dap  ge 1v(cid:2)  danp1 + g iv dap(cid:3) .

3

(9)

(10)

analogously, one nds

danp1 = danp1  ge 1v(cid:2)  ()n(p+1)  dap + g iv danp1(cid:3) .

(11)

note that due to the appearance of e 1 the covariant derivatives, and thus the gauge
transformations, of ap and anp1 are non-polynomial in the connection v and the
coupling constant g.
as can be checked, dap and danp1 are indeed covariant, i.e. their gauge transfor-
mations do not involve derivatives of , and one has

 dap = g dap = g d  danp1

 danp1 = g danp1 = ()n(p+1)g d  dap .

(12)

now we can proceed to construct the gauge invariant action. to do this, we use the
following fact: let x be a covariant volume form which transforms according to x =
g dk, with k a covariant (n  1)-form. then x + g v k transforms into a total
derivative,

x = g dk ,

k = g k  (x + g v k) = d(g k) .

in particular, thanks to (12) this applies to

x = ()(p+1)(n1) dap  dap + ()p(n1) danp1  danp1

with

adding a kinetic term for the connection v , the action thus reads

k = 2()np  dap  danp1 .

s =

1

2 z (cid:0)x + g v k + dv  dv(cid:1) ,

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

with x and k as in (14) and (15). by construction, s is a surface term, with the
transformations as in (4), (5) and g = 0. furthermore, the action is invariant under
the standard spacetime dieomorphisms and the abelian gauge transformations of ap
and anp1,

ap = dp1 ,

anp1 = dnp2 ,

(17)

since these elds enter the covariant derivatives (10), (11) only via their exterior deriva-
tives.

alternatively, one may consider a rst order formulation. introducing auxiliary elds
p and np1, with the form degree as indicated, the action is given by

s =

1

2 z (cid:2)dv  dv + ()p(n1) p  p + ()(p+1)(n1) np1  np1

+ 2p danp1  2()n(p+1)np1 dap  2()pg v pnp1(cid:3) ,

(18)

4

while the gauge transformations read

v = d ,

ap = g p ,

anp1 = g np1

p = np1 = g = 0 .

(19)

the equations of motion for the auxiliary elds are coupled in exactly the same way as
the equations that determine the covariant derivatives of ap and anp1,

()p(n1)  p = danp1  g v np1
()p  np1 = dap  g v p ,

and the solutions are thus

p = ap ,

np1 = anp1 .

(20)

(21)

the action (18) may also be used to derive a dual version of our model. to that
end one solves the equations of motion for ap and anp1 through p = dap1 and
np1 = danp2 and inserts the solution back into the action. the interaction vertex
v pnp1 then turns into a chern-simons term.

remark. if n = 1 + 4k and p = 2k, one may identify ap with anp1. for instance, in
the case n = 5, p = 2 one then gets a 5-dimensional theory involving only one 2-form
gauge eld besides v and the gravitational eld.

generalizations

coupling to gravitational chern-simons forms

we shall now discuss how the basic model introduced above can be generalized by
including couplings of p-form gauge potentials to gravitational chern-simons forms.
we denote a gravitational chern-simons p-form by qp, where p = 3, 7, . . . , or p = n 1
in n = 2k dimensional spacetime (the latter case corresponds to the euler density in
even dimensional spacetime). so, for instance, in 5-dimensional spacetime there is only
 =
one gravitational chern-simons form, q3, which satises dq3 = r
1
).
2dxdxr
in 4-dimensional spacetime there are two independent gravitational chern-simons 3-
forms, q3 and q 
in a rst order formulation, a gravitational chern-simons (p + 1)-form can be coupled
to a p-form gauge potential through the following extension of the action (18),

  1
 and dq 

3 = rr respectively.

 (explicitly one has q3 = 

, where r
 = dx





, where 

3, satisfying dq3 = r

r

r

3

r

s =

1

2 z (cid:2)dv  dv + ()p(n1) p  p + ()(p+1)(n1) np1  np1

(22)

+ 2p danp1  2()n(p+1)np1 (dap + qp+1)  2()pg v pnp1(cid:3) .

this action is invariant under the gauge transformations (17) and (19), and the following
modication of the spacetime dieomorphisms,

 = l for   {g, p, np1, anp1}

5

ap = lap  rp ,

(23)

where l is the standard lie derivative along the vector eld  (with lp = (1/p!) 
dx1. . . dxpl1...p etc.), and rp is the p-form whose exterior derivative is the non-
covariant part of qp+1,

qp+1 = lqp+1 + drp .

(24)

, for instance. as usual, the combination
so for q3 as above, one gets r2 = d
dap + qp+1 transforms covariantly under , (dap + qp+1) = l(dap + qp+1), and
therefore the action (22) is indeed invariant under .
from the above formulae one easily infers the second order version of the action and
the gauge transformations in presence of chern-simons couplings. it is simply obtained
from (4) and (16) by substituting dap + qp+1 for dap everywhere. note that this results
in the presence of the gravitational chern-simons form qp+1 both in ap and anp1.

dimensional reduction

we shall now perform a dimensional reduction from n to n  1 dimensions. this gives
rise to couplings to additional gauge elds and scalars. we shall discuss explicitly only
the dimensional reduction of the basic model. the extension to more involved models,
such as those with additional chern-simons couplings, is straightforward.
we denote the coordinates by

x = (xa, xn) ,

a = 1, . . . , n  1 ,

(25)

and take all elds to be constant along the xn-direction. then the metric decomposes
in the usual manner,

g dx  dx = gab dxa  dxb + e2(w + dxn)  (w + dxn) ,

(26)

where w = dxawa is a 1-form in n  1 dimensions.
upon dimensional reduction, ap gives rise to a p-form ap and a (p1)-form ap1, while
anp1 decomposes into an (n  p  1)-form anp1 and an (n  p  2)-form anp2.
the connection v introduces in addition to a 1-form v a scalar eld ,

ap = ap + ap1 dxn , anp1 = anp1 + anp2 dxn ,

v = v +  dxn .

(27)

in the following, one should keep in mind that the descendants ap, anp1 and v
all transform non-trivially under the abelian gauge transformation associated with w ,
while ap1, anp2 and  are invariant,

w = d ,

 ap = ap1 d ,

 anp1 = anp2 d ,

 v =  d

 ap1 =  anp2 =  = 0 .

(28)

 originates from a general coordinate transformation in the nth direction.

6

when decomposing the dual of a p-form p, we make use of the relation

 p = e  p1 + ()p e  (p  p1w ) (w + dxn) ,

where the hodge star  in n  1 dimensions involves the reduced levi-civita tensor
a1...an1 = e a1...an1n and indices are raised with gab.
there are now two ways of determining the covariant derivatives and gauge transforma-
tions of the a-elds, which turn out to give the same results. one may either start from
the rst order formulation and solve the dimensionally reduced equations of motion for
the auxiliary elds, or one may directly decompose the equations (10) and (11). let us
follow the latter approach: we dene a covariant derivative d by the relations

dap = d ap + d ap1 dxn , danp1 = d anp1 + d anp2 dxn .

(29)

the decomposition of the left-hand sides is straightforward, and by comparison of the
terms with and without dxn one derives the action of d on the four gauge elds.
similarly to the gauge elds themselves, the descendants d ap and d anp1 transform
non-covariantly under . it is convenient to use -invariant generalized eld strengths
instead, analogous to those appearing in kaluza-klein supergravity models (see e.g.
[7]),

fp+1 = d ap  d ap1 w , fnp = d anp1  d anp2 w .

(30)

then also the connection v appears always in a -invariant combination, which we
denote by

since the original n-dimensional elds do not appear anymore, we shall omit all hats
in the following. explicitly, one nds

u = v  w .

(31)

fp+1 = dap  dap1 w  ge 1u(cid:2)e  danp2 + g iu (dap  dap1 w )
+ ()pg e2 dap1(cid:3)
fnp = danp1  danp2 w  ge 1u(cid:2)  ()n(p+1)e  dap1
+ g iu (danp1  danp2 w )  ()npg e2 danp2(cid:3) ,

(32)

and

dap1 = dap1  ge 1u(cid:2)()npe (danp1  danp2 w ) + g iu dap1(cid:3)

 ge 1(cid:2)()pe  danp2 + ()pg iu (dap  dap1 w )
+ g e2 dap1(cid:3)

danp2 = danp2  ge 1u(cid:2)  ()(p+1)(n1)e (dap  dap1 w ) + g iu danp2(cid:3)

 ge 1(cid:2)()p(n1)e  dap1  ()npg iu (danp1  danp2 w )
+ g e2 danp2(cid:3) ,

(33)

7

where now

e = 1 + g2u aua + g2e22 .

(34)

the above expressions enter the gauge transformations  of the forms ap etc., which
are found to read

ap = g (cid:2)e  danp2 + ()npe fnpw(cid:3)
ap1 = ()npg  e fnp
anp1 = ()n(p+1)g (cid:2)e  dap1  ()pe  fp+1w(cid:3)
anp2 = ()(p+1)(n1)g  e fp+1 ,

while those of the remaining elds are simply

u = d ,

 = w =  =  gab = 0 .

(35)

(36)

we observe that dap1 and danp2 contain terms which are accompanied by the
scalar  rather than the connection u. one may introduce minimal covariant deriva-
tives d of ap1 and anp2 by substracting appropriate covariant terms from dap1
and danp2,

dap1 = dap1 + ()pg e  danp2

danp2 = danp2 + ()p(n1)g e  dap1 .

this results in the following simpler expressions:

dap1 = dap1  ge 1u(cid:2)()npe e (danp1  danp2 w ) + g iu dap1

 ()pg2e iu  danp2(cid:3)

danp2 = danp2  ge 1u(cid:2)  ()(p+1)(n1)e e (dap  dap1 w )

+ g iu danp2  ()p(n1)g2 iu  dap1(cid:3) ,

where e is a function of the scalar elds only,

e = 1 + g2e22 .

equations (37) can be inverted to express dap1 and danp2 in terms of the minimal
covariant derivatives,

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

dap1 = e 1(cid:2)dap1  ()pg e danp2(cid:3)
danp2 = e 1(cid:2)danp2  ()p(n1)g e dap1(cid:3) .

finally, we obtain the gauge invariant action in (n  1)-dimensional spacetime by re-
duction of equation (16). using the equations (30), (31) and (40), it can be written
entirely in terms of -invariant as well as -covariant expressions,

s =

1

2 z h e(du +  dw ) (du +  dw ) + ()ned  d

8

+ ()n(p+1) e(cid:0)fp+1 fp+1 + fnp fnp(cid:1)
+ ()np e 1e(cid:0)dap1 dap1 + danp2 danp2(cid:1)
 2g e 1u(cid:0)  dap1 fnp  ()n(p+1)  danp2 fp+1(cid:1)
 2()p(n1)g2e 1e u(cid:0)danp2 fnp  ()ndap1 fp+1(cid:1)
+ 2()pg e 1e2 dap1danp2i .

(41)

as compared to (16), the new feature of the action (41) is the coupling of ,  and
w . indeed, if we set these elds to zero, (41) reduces to an action of the form (16) in
n = n  1 dimensions, for two pairs of exterior form gauge elds with form degrees
(p, n  p  1) and (p  1, n  p): one gets (16) with x = x1 + x2 and k = k1 + k2,
where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the rst and second pair respectively (xi and ki
match their counterparts in (14) and (15) up to sign factors which can be removed by
trivial eld redenitions a  a). clearly, one may iterate the dimensional reduction
procedure to derive more involved models of the above type. again, after setting to
zero scalar and vector elds coming from g and v , the resulting actions reduce to
the form (16) for more pairs of exterior form gauge elds.

comments

to understand the structure of the models, it is useful to keep in mind that they are
consistent deformations of the standard einstein-maxwell action for exterior form gauge
elds, plus kinetic terms for the additional elds in the models obtained by dimensional
reduction. the non-polynomial structure and the non-triviality of the interactions can
be traced to the properties of the global symmetry (2) that is gauged.
namely, to rst order in the coupling constant g, the deformed einstein-maxwell action

(16) reads s1 = ()npgr v j, where j is the noether current (3). hence, s1 is nothing

but the standard noether coupling of the gauge eld v to the conserved current of the
global symmetry (2). the corresponding rst order deformation of the gauge symmetry
involves the global symmetry (2) itself: it is just 1 = g (i.e. 1ap = g  danp1,
1anp1 = ()n(p+1)g  dap). it can be readily checked that 1s1 does not vanish,
due to the fact that j is not invariant under . rather, one has 1s1  0s2, where
 denotes weak equality (= on-shell equality), i.e. equality up to terms that involve
the left hand sides of the equations of motion. as a consequence, consistency of the
interactions at second order makes it necessary to introduce second order deformations
both of the action and of the gauge symmetry (this can be rigorously proved by brst
cohomological arguments along the lines of [8]). this extends to all higher orders and
leads to the non-polynomial structure of the interactions and gauge transformations.
in fact the situation is somewhat similar to the coupling of the gravitational eld to
matter in standard gravity. indeed, viewed as a deformation using g =  + m1
pl h,
the rst order deformation couples h to the energy momentum tensor t  in at
spacetime. t  is the noether current of translations and not invariant under the
generators of translations given by the spacetime derivatives. this leads to interactions

9

that are non-polynomial in h and in the coupling constant m1
constructed by means of the familiar tensor calculus.
the non-standard coupling of the p-form gauge potentials to scalar elds present in the
dimensionally reduced models can be understood analogously from the point of view of
consistent deformations. if we specialize these models by setting w and  to zero, the

pl which are compactly

rst order coupling of the scalar eld  is just gr  dap1danp2 (up to a factor), i.e.

it couples  to the topological density dap1danp2. again, the latter is not invariant
under 1. this enforces further interaction terms of higher order, with higher powers
of , and eventually non-polynomial interactions of . analogous statements apply in
presence of w and , where further interactions are present. one may disentangle the
various couplings in these interactions by introducing further coupling constants g1 and
g2 through the rescalings w  g1w ,   g2.
hence, though one might have suspected that the non-polynomial interactions of the
scalar elds (and of w ) in the above models are just an artefact of the dimensional
reduction, such interactions are actually to be expected in gauge theories of the type
studied here, whether or not the models can be obtained by dimensional reduction. in
fact, the reader may check that non-polynomial interactions of scalar elds similar to
those found here are present in all supersymmetric models constructed in [2, 3, 6].
finally we comment briey on the non-triviality of the deformations constructed here.
deformations of actions and gauge transformations are called trivial if they can be
removed by mere eld redenitions. the non-triviality of the deformations constructed
here traces to the non-triviality of the global symmetry  and its current j (again, this
can be shown by brst cohomological arguments).
in general, the non-triviality of conserved currents is concisely formulated in the so-
called characteristic cohomology (see e.g. [9]) related to the equations of motion. this
cohomology is dened through the cocycle condition dp  0 and the coboundary
condition p  dp1, where p and p1 are local forms constructed of the elds and
their derivatives (of rst or higher order) and  denotes weak equality as described
above. in our case j is indeed a non-trivial cocycle of the characteristic cohomology
related to the einstein-maxwell equations: it is conserved, dj  0, and non-trivial since
there is no local (n  2)-form n2 such that j  dn2.
this implies already that  is non-trivial too, because a global symmetry is trivial
(= weakly equal to a gauge transformation) if and only if the corresponding noether
current is trivial in the characteristic cohomology [10] (when global subtleties are absent
or irrelevant). in fact, in our case the non-triviality of  traces also directly to the
characteristic cohomology:  dap and  danp1 are non-trivial in that cohomology (cf.
[11]) and thus ap and anp1 are not weakly equal to a gauge transformation.
remark. the non-triviality of j,  dap and  danp1 in the characteristic cohomology
does not contradict the fact that these quantities are exact (at least locally) when one
evaluates them for a specic solution to the equations of motion. in fact, by the ordinary
poincare lemma, they are locally exact for any specic solution to the equations of
motion since they are weakly closed. the latter statement applies of course to every
cocycle of the characteristic cohomology (except for the constant 0-forms), and thus in
particular to every noether current, whether or not it is trivial. the point is that a
form p which is trivial in the characteristic cohomology is weakly equal to dp1 with

10

a denite p1, that involves the elds and their derivatives and does not depend upon
which solution to the equations of motion one considers.
