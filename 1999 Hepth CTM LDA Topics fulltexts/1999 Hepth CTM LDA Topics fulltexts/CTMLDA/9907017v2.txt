we directly derive the classical equation of motion, which governs the centre of mass of a test
string, from the string action. in a certain case, the equation is basically same as one derived by
papapetrou, dixon and wald for a test extended body. we also discuss the force balance using a
stringy probe particle for an exact spinning multi-soliton solution of einstein-maxwell-dilaton-axion
theory. it is well known that the force balance condition yields the saturation of the bogomolnyi
type bound in the lowest order. in the present formulation the gyromagnetic ratio of the stringy
probe particle is automatically determined to be g = 2 which is the same value as the background
soliton. as a result we can conrm the force balance via the gravitational spin-spin interaction.

i. introduction

probe technique is useful for studying the approximate dynamics of multi-soliton systems as multi-black-holes. by
the term of probe we mean a sort of collective coordinate like the centre of mass. so-called test particle is one of
probes and is governed by the geodesic equation. the test particle is frequently used to estimate the gravitational
wave from binary systems in an early stage.

among of the multi-soliton solution, bps multi-soliton is an important object. the existence is guaranteed by
the so-called force balance. the simplest example is the majumdar-papapetrou(mp) solution [1] in the d = 4
einstein-maxwell theory or n = 2 d = 4 supergravity [2]. it is well known that the electrostatic force balances with
the gravitational attractive force. furthermore, the force balance still holds up to the gravitational spin-spin and
dipole-spin interaction for the israel-wilson-perjes(iwp) solution [3] which becomes the mp solution in the static
limit, that is, the iwp solution is the spinning version of the mp solution [4]. the force balance condition yields
the saturation of the bogomolnyi bound and the correct gyromagnetic ratio g = 2 of a spinning charged test body
[4]. we realise, however, that the same situation does not hold in the einstein-maxwell-dilaton (emd) system, that
is, the force balance condition does not give the correct gyromagnetic ratio [5]. it was shown that the gyromagnetic
ratio of the test body is dierent from that of the background space-time. this fact may indicate the non-existence
of the spinning multi-soliton solution in the emd system. on the other hand, we are aware of an exact solution of
spinning multi-soliton in the d = 4 einstein-maxwell-dilaton-axion (emda) system [6]. obviously the new essential
ingredient is the axion eld. hence, taking account of the contribution from the axion eld is important to resolve
the above discrepancy of the gyromagnetic ratio.

in this paper we derive the equation of motion(eom) for the centre of mass of a string, say stringy probe particle,
coupled with the general metric and the axion eld. there may be two dierent ways to the end at rst glance.
one of them is the papapetrou procedure [7] rened by dixon [8] and wald [9]. this approach is based on the local
conservation low for the energy-momentum tensor and current of gauge elds. we expect that one can derive the
eom for the center of the mass of a string in this procedure although we will not show here. in this paper, we will
adopt another approach which is expected to be simpler than the papapetrou-dixon-wald procedure.

the d = 4 emda system describes a low energy string theory. the low energy string eective action originally
comes from the requirement of the conformal invariance on the two dimensional  model [10]. it tells us that we
should back to the  model to derive the eom for a stringy probe particle. the contribution from the electromagnetic

and dilation eld can be obtained by a certain dimensional reduction and conformal transformation from the string
to the einstein frame.

the rest of this paper is organised as follows. in sec. ii, we derive the eom for a stringy probe beginning with
the two-dimensional  model. the curved target space-time is ten dimensional. through the adequate dimensional
reduction to four dimensions we obtain the eom in the string frame. in this formulation the gyromagnetic ratio of
a probe is uniquely determined to be g = 2. in sec. iii we will give an argument of the energy bound, so-called
bogomolnyi type bound. in sec. iv, we will discuss the force balance between a spinning exact solution of the d = 4
emda system and a stringy probe particle via the gravitational spin-spin interaction. we conrm that the force
balance holds when the bogomolnyi bound is saturated. finally, we will give a summary and discussion in sec. v.

ii. stringy probe particle

a. stringy probe particle in ten dimensions

the action of the string coupled with the general metric and axion eld is

sp = 

1

2 z d dpdet(gab)[gm n (x)gab + bm n (x)ab]ax m bx n ,

(2.1)

where m = 0, 1, ..., 9 and a = 0, 1. gab, gm n and bm n are the metric of the world volume of the string, the metric of
the ten-dimensional space-time and the anti-symmetric tensor, respectively. in the above we omitted the dilaton term
because of its small contribution. to obtain the eective action for the centre of the mass of a string, we decompose
x m (, ) into the centre of mass and the excitation around it as follows,

x m (, ) = x

m

( ) + xm (, ),

here we assumed that the typical scale of the curvature of the background space-time is much larger than that of the
typical scale of the string. for our present purpose it is enough that the excitation can be approximately described
in the at metric. the expression is given by

this circumstance corresponds to that of the soliton which will be discussed later in sec. iv.

interaction. the third term is just what we wanted and expresses the axion-spin interaction term occured due to the
additional ingredient, axion eld. as we will show later, the term is essential for the force balance in the respect with
the spin-spin interactions. we expect that the equation should be derived by the papapetrou-dixon-wald approach
too. beside the axion term, the above equation is basically identical with the higher-dimensional version of one
obtained in [7] [8] [9].

b. stringy probe particle in four dimensions

next, we derive the eom for a stringy probe particle in four dimensions. to this end we now remember that the
four dimensional low energy eective string action for the metric, electromagnetic, axion eld and dilaton elds can
be derived by a certain dimensional reduction of the ten dimensional low energy string action,

s10 = z d10xe2

(2.12)

the actual procedure is given by [11]

g = gs + aa, g4 = a, g44 = 1, gab = ab, g4a = ga = 0

(2.13)

and

3

b = b,

b4 = a,

(2.14)

where  = 0, 1, 2, 3 and a = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. in the above we imposed that all of the above elds do not depend on the
coordinates x4  x9. we obtain the action in the string frame,

where h = 3[b] + 3a[f]. to obtain the action in the einstein frame we have to take the conformal

(2.16)

(2.17)

now we can write down the eom in terms of the four-dimensional quantities dened by eqs. (2.13) and (2.14). in

the string frame, the eom for a stringy probe particle is immediately written as

we can easily see that the dilaton eld has no contributions to the leading order of the spin-spin interaction [5].
since we are only interested in the force balance via the spin-spin interaction in this paper, we can go on in the
string frame. if one wants to study the force balance in the einstein frame, one should insert the above conformal
transformation(eq.(2.16)) into eq.
it is, however, well known that the force balance between monopole

components yields the saturation of a bogomolnyi bound (|q| = 2m , in the present stringy case).

iii. energy bound for d=4 einstein-maxwell-dilaton-axion theory

in this section, we give the energy bound argument for the d = 4 emda system in the einstein frame. this is
basically same as the proof given in ref. [13] except for the existence of the axion eld. in four dimensions the axion
eld can be expressed by a scalar eld, a, as follows,

here, bearing n = 4 d = 4 supergravity in mind, we dene the supercovariant derivative for a spinor  by

h = e4a.

in this section  stands for the covariant derivative associated with the einstein metric g. the spinor  is assumed
to satisfy the modied witten equation i i = 0. furthermore, we dene the nester-like tensor [14],

e(f   5 f  ),

(3.4)

where f  = (1/2)f. hereafter we assume that  has the chirality of 5 = i. this is inuenced by n = 4
d = 4 supergravity. the divergence of the nester-like tensor becomes

iv. force balance via gravitational spin-spin interaction

in this section we will conrm the force balance between the gravitational spin-spin, dipole-spin and axion-spin
interactions when the bogomolnyi type bound is saturated. as we said in sec. i, the spinning multi-soliton solution
exists in the d = 4 emda system. this solution is the straightforward extension of the iwp solution and saturates

the bogomolnyi bound, i.e., |q| = 2m . we expect that the force balance holds via the gravitational spin-spin
interaction therein. to check the force balance, we consider the motion of a stringy probe particle on the background
geometry of the single soliton with q = 2m . in the einstein frame the single solution is given by [6]

and

ds2 = e2(dt + idxi)2 + e2dx2

a =

e2(dt + idxi),

(4.1)

(4.2)

where i = 1, 2, 3 and ijkjk = ia. in the limit of the slow rotating the metric, vector potential and axion eld
are written as

where  is the parameter of the angular momentum so that ~j = (0, 0, m ). one can nd the exact expression of the
above solution in ref. [6].

because of gs00 = e2g00 = e4. hence we can see the force cancellation between the newtonian-like gravitational
and the coulombic electrostatic forces when q = 2m holds.
let us conrm the force balance via the gravitational spin-spin interaction. the spin-spin, dipole-spin and axion-spin

where si := (1/2)ijksjk and r := r/r. as we can easily see, the above total force exactly vanishes when the
bogomolnyi type bound is saturated, that is, q = 2m and q = 2m.

v. summary and discussion

in this paper we derived the equation of motion for a stringy probe particle coupled with the axion eld.

its
gyromagnetic ratio is automatically determined in the present formulation and turns out to be g = 2. moreover, we
conrmed that the force balance holds via the gravitational spin-spin interaction when the bogomolnyi type bound is
saturated. the behaviour of the probe seems to be related to the existence of the multi-soliton solution in the d = 4
einstein-maxwell-dilaton-axion(emda) system.

we investigated the force balance in four dimensions. as we can see the multi-soliton solution has naked singularity
in the d = 4 emda system [6] as well as the kerr-newman space-time at the saturation of the bogomolnyi bound.
on the other hand, horowitz and sen found a multi-soliton solution without naked singularity in d > 5-dimension
[15]. they also made the four dimensional black hole space-time by taking doubly periodic allays in six dimensions. so
the force balance therein is also important and it seems to be easy to extend our present work to the higher-dimensional
version.

as we moderately said, the value of the gyromagnetic ratio is important to discover exact spinning multi-soliton
solutions. before we try to discover it is advisable to check the value of probe gyromagnetic ratio, that is, whether the
value gyromagnetic ratio is same as that of the background soliton or not. if same, we are able to have a great chance
to discover a new solution. we think that this phrase may be valid for higher-dimensional objects like d-brane [16]

7

[17]. in addition, one might be going to nd an exact solution of the cosmological spinning multi-black hole which
should be the extension of the cosmological non-spinning multi-black hole exact solution discovered by kastor and
traschen [18]. so, we should check the force balance in cosmos.

our basic equation (eq. (2.22)) might be useful to study the approximate dynamics of a test string in a curved
background space-time. taking account of the axion terms is essential if the string is excited. if the string stays in
the ground state, the motion is simply geodesic one. in our approach, a test string is assumed to be widely separated
from the central soliton. if not so, we cannot use the excitation form of eq. (2.6) in the at metric and must consider
the time evolution due to the strong gravity or tidal forces [19].

finally, we should give a comment on the assumption of eq. (2.9). from the analysis given in sec. iv, we realise
that the stringy probe particle plays as the test body like the central soliton under the assumption. namely, the
soliton given by eqs. (4.1) and (4.2) seems to be related to the right-moving string state. this is because the solution
is in the bps state and the absence of the left(or right) moving excitation(oscillation) is essential for the bps state
[20].

beside our present purpose of the force balance, eq. (2.8) should be used for general cases having both excitations.
the comparison with the equation derived by the papapetrou procedure [7] is important because it is not likely that
the extra terms does not appear in the procedure.
