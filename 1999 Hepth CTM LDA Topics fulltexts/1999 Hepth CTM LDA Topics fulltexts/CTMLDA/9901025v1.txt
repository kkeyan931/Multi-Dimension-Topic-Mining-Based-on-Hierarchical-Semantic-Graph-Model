abstract

in a chiral ul(n )  ur(n ) fermion model of njl-form, we prove that, if all the
fermions are assumed to have equal masses and equal chemical potentials, then at
the nite temperature t below the symmetry restoration temperature tc, there will
be n 2 massive scalar composite particles and n 2 massless pseudoscalar composite
particles (nambu-goldstone bosons). this shows that the goldstone theorem at
nite temperature for spontaneous symmetry breaking ul(n )ur(n )  ul+r(n )
is consistent with the real-time formalism of thermal eld theory in this model.

1 introduction

the nambu-goldstone mechanism [1-3] characterizes spontaneous breaking of a conti-
neous symmetry. while it has been researched extensively at zero temperature eld
theory, it is still interesting to examine how this mechanism manifests itself at a nite
temperature for a deeper understanding of symmetry breaking at high temperature, es-
pecially of the consistency between the nambu-goldstone mechanisim and the real-time
thermal eld theorys formalism [4]. this consistency is not trival in some models. in
this paper, as an example, we will take a simple model of nambu-jona-lasinio (njl) -
form [2] with ul(n)  ur(n)- chirally -invariant four-fermion interactions to explore this
problem. in the fermion bubble graph approximation we will calculate the propagators
of the scalar and pseudoscalar bound state modes, determine the masses of these bound
states and nally conrm that, under some conditions, the nambu-goldstone mechanism
will be consistent with the real-time formalism of thermal eld theory in this model.

for a fermion system with ul(n)  ur(n) -invariant four-fermion interactions, its la-
grangian can be generally expressed by

(2.1)
where the fermion elds ql and qr are respectively assigned in the n-dimension rep-
resentations of the symmetry group ul(n) and ur(n) and g, gl and gr are the real
coupling constants of the corresponding four-fermion interactions. it is indicated that the
independent four-fermion couplings have only the scalar and the vector coupling terms
appearing in eq.(2.1). by fierz rearrangement theorem, it can be proven that the tensor
coupling with  does not exist and all the other couplings including the ones with 5,
5 and the vector coupling between ql and qr elds can be transformed into the forms
shown in eq.(2.1). by means of

we can rewrite the scalar coupling among the chiral elds by

j=1 ( qjqj)2 among the same qj elds could
assuming that the scalar couplings (g/4)pn
lead to formation of the condensates h qjqji (j = 1, ..., n) and generation of the fermion
masses mj (j = 1, ...n). at nite temperature t , the condensate h qjqji must be replaced
by the corresponding thermal expectation value h qjqjit , thus we will obtain the gap
equation for the dynamical fermion mass at t 6= 0

mj(t, j) =

(2.4)

a natural supposition is that

1 = 2 = . . . = n =  and m1 = m2 = . . . = mn = m  m(t, ),

(2.5)

i.e. the chemical potentials and the dynamical masses of all the fermions are equal, then
the gap equation will take the form

it is pointed out that the gap equation (2.6) could be satised only at the temperature
t < tc, where tc is the critical temperature for chiral symmetry restoration in a model
of njl-form [5]. in the following discussions of the propagators of bound states we will
conne ourselves to the temperature below tc, i.e. assume eq.(2.6) is satised.

3 scalar bound state modes

the propagators for scalar bound states relate to the scalar four-point functions of
fermions. to calculate them in the real-time formalism of thermal eld theory, we must
take the doubled scalar four-fermion interaction lagrangian [4]

ls

int =

xj,k=1

,

(3.1)

where a = 1 means physical elds and a = 2 ghost elds. the physical and the ghost
elds can interact only through propagators. consider scalar bound state ( qkqj). the
scalar four-point function from a-type vertex to b-type vertex will be denoted by

( qjqk)(b)( qkqj)(a)

s

(p)  ba

s (p),

then in the bubble graph approximation, they submit to the following equations

(3.2)

which are extension of the similar equations at zero temperature [6] to nite temper-
ature, where p is the four-momentum of the bound state ( qkqj), lca(p) expresses the
contribution of the qj  qk fermion loop with an a-type and a c-type scalar interaction
vertex,

lca(p)  lca

qkqj (p) = z

(3.6)

the problem is reduced to the calculation of the fermionic loop lca(p). from eqs.(3.3)
and (2.8), by direct but rather lengthy derivation we obtain

l11(p) = 2ii + (4m2  p2  i){i[k(p) + h(p)] + s(p)} = [l22(p)],

where k(p), h(p), s(p) and r(p) are all real functions and expressed by

l12(p) = l21(p) = (4m2  p2)r(p),

owing to the fact that the arguments of the three -functions in the integrand can not be
equal to zeros simultaneously. we notice that the pinch singularities will appear in s(p)

4

and r(p) when p  0. substituting eq.(3.7) into eq.(3.6) and taking the gap equation
(2.6) into account, we obtain the propagator for physical scalar bound state ( qkqj)

r2(p)

k(p) + h(p) + is(p)# .

(3.14)
it seems that p2 = 4m2 is the simple pole of s(p). to verify this we must examine
the behavior of k(p), h(p), s(p) and r(p) at p2 = 4m2. it is seen from eq.(3.8) that
k(p)|p2=4m2 is a nite constant when  is xed. by means of eq.(2.9), we may rewrite
h(p) in eq.(3.9) by

h(p) =

(3.15)
where the zero points of the arguments of all the logrithmic function must be removed
from the integral because these functions come from the integration of the principal parts
it is indicated that h(p) in eq.(3.15) contains no singularity when
of the integrand.

which are nite even if when  = 0. it is easy to nd that when p2 = 4m2 the arguments

when p2 = 4m2, the general form of s(p) and r(p) may be expressed by

since |cos|  1, the argument of the rst -function in eq.(3.17) could not be zero for

this means that

s(p)|p2=4m2 = r(p)|p2=4m2 = 0.
as a result, the propagator of the scalar bound state ( qkqj)

(3.19)

s(p)  i/(p2  4m2 + i)[k(p) + h(p)],

when p2  4m2

(3.20)

and p2 = 4m2 is its simple pole indeed. in this way, we obtain n 2 scalar bound states
( qkqj) (j, k = 1, ..., n) with the mass 2m.
it may be veried that s(p) expressed by eq.(3.14) contains no pinch singularity. we
notice that when p  0 k(p) is still a nite constant, and h(p) = 0 by eq.(3.9) and
s(p)  r(p) = 0 from eqs.(3.10) and (3.11). these results indicate that the terms
containing pinch singularity in the denominator of s(p) will become

r2(p)

k(p) + is(p)

is(p)k(p) + s2(p)  r2(p)

s2(p)

 0,

(3.21)

i.e. the pinch singularities in the propagator s(p) will be cancelled by each other and do
not appear in the nal expression.

4 pseudoscalar bound state modes

a pararell discussion to scalar bound states can be applied to the case with pseudoscalar
bound states. the relevant four-fermion interactions are now expressed by the lagrangian

lp

int =

g

4 xa=1,2

n

xj,k=1

(1)a+1( qji5qk)

(a)

( qki5qj)

(a)

.

(4.1)

for pseudoscalar bound state ( qki5qj), the corresponding pseudoscalar four-point func-
tion from a-type vertex to b-type vertex can be denoted by

( qj i5qk)(b)( qki5qj)

p

(a)

(p)  ba

p (p)

and submit to the algebraic equations

ba

p (p) = i

g
2

(1)a+1ba + xc=1,2

p (p)n ca(p)i
bc

g
2

(1)a+1, a, b = 1, 2

(4.2)

where n ca(p) expresses the contribution of the qj  qk fermion loop with an a-type and
a c-type pseudoscalar interaction vertex, i.e.

n ca(p)  n ca

qkqj (p) = z

d4l
(2)4 tr[i5isca(l, m)i5isac(l + p, m)].

(4.3)

it is easy to see that eq.(4.2) has the same form as eq.(3.2) after the substitutions
ba
s (p) and n ca(p)  lca(p). hence we can directly put down the propagators
p (p)  ba
for physical pseudoscalar bound states ( qki5qj) (j, k = 1, ..., n)

p (p)  11

p (p) = i

g2
4

n 12(p)n 21(p)/(cid:20)1 + i

g
2

n 22(p)(cid:21)) .

(4.4)

6

the results of calculations of n ca(p) are

n 11(p) = 2ii  i(p2 + i)[k(p) + h(p)]  is(p)] = [n 22(p)],

n 12(p) = n 21(p) = p2r(p).

thus we obtain

p (p) = i/(p2 + i)"k(p) + h(p)  is(p) 

r2(p)

k(p) + h(p) + is(p)# .

(4.5)

(4.6)

we observe that when p2  0, k(p) is nite, h(p) in eq.(3.9) is equal to zero and
both s(p) and r(p) are also equal to zeroes because the arguments of (l2  m2) and
[(l + p)2  m2] in eqs.(3.10) and (3.11) can not be zeroes simultaneously. consequently,
we have

p (p) p20 i/(p2 + i)k(p)

(4.7)

which is of the same form as the propagator for pseudoscalar bound state at t = 0.
therefore, p2 = 0 is the simple pole of p (p) and we will have n 2 massless pseudoscalar
bound states ( qki5qj) (j, k = 1, ..., n). by comparing eq.(4.6) with eq.(3.14) we see
that p (p) and s(p) have the identical form except the position of the pole. hence
the same cancellation mechanism of the pinch singularities as in s(p) certainly exists in
p (p) as well and we need not worry about the problem of pinch singularity here.

5 conclusion

the above discussions show that under the assumption (2.5) i.e. all the fermions have
equal masses and equal chemical potentials, at the nite temperature t < tc, the critical
temperature below which the gap equation (2.6) is satised, we may obtain n 2 scalar
bound states ( qkqj) (j, k = 1, ..., n) with the mass 2m and n 2 massless pseudoscalar
bound states ( qki5qj) (j, k = 1, ..., n). these results characterize spontaneous symme-
try breaking of the chiral group ul(n)  ur(n) down to the vector-like group ul+r(n).
the n 2 massive scalar composite particles will correspond to the generators of the unbro-
ken group ul+r(n). the n 2 massless pseudoscalar composite particles will correspond
to the generators of the broken axial-vector group ulr(n) and can be identied with
the nambu-goldstone bosons. this shows the goldstone theorem at nite temperature.
here the theorem is proven in the chiral ul(n)  ur(n) model of njl-form by means
of the real-time formalism of thermal eld theory without any incosistency. however, we
emphesize that the assumption (2.5) is decisive for validity of such consistency between
the goldstone theorem at nite temperature and the real-time thermal eld theory. for
the model discussed in this paper, the assumption (2.5), especially that the fermions have
the same masses, can be natural and plausible. as for the models in which the assumption
(2.5) could not satised, we will research them elsewhere.
