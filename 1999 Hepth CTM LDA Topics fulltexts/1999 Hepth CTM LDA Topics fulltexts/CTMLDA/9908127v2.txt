abstract

a method is developed to construct the solutions of one and many variable,

linear dierential equations of arbitrary order. using this, the n -particle

sutherland model, with pair-wise inverse sine-square interactions among the

particles, is shown to be equivalent to free particles on a circle. applicability

of our method to many other few and many-body problems is also illustrated.

the calogero-sutherland model (csm) [1,2] and its generalizations [3,4] are extremely

well-studied quantum mechanical systems, having relevance to diverse branches of physics

[5], such as the universal conductance uctuations in mesoscopic systems [6], quantum hall

eect [7], wave propagation in stratied elds [8], random matrix theory [2,5,9,10], fractional

statistics [11], gravity [12] and gauge theories [13]. in particular, the sutherland model [3],

describing n-identical particles having pair-wise inverse distance square interaction on a

circle has received wider attention in the context of questions related to statistics [14]. the

spectrum of this exactly solvable model can be interpreted as arising from a set of free

quasi-particles satisfying the generalized exclusion principle [15].

some time ago, the present authors have shown that, the csm is equivalent to a set

of free harmonic oscillators [16]. this mapping throws considerable light into the algebraic

structure of this correlated system [17,18]. later, the same model, without the harmonic

connement, was made unitarily equivalent to free particle [19]. however, the connection

between the sutherland model and free particles have so far remained an open problem. in

this paper, we establish the equivalence of the sutherland model to free particles on a circle,

for arbitrary number of particles.

this paper is organized as follows.

(i) a general method is developed to solve any

linear dierential equation of arbitrary order, (ii) a few examples are discussed to show how

the present technique yields the known, as well as, new results, (iii) the usefulness of this

technique for solving the schrodinger equation with complicated potentials is pointed out,

(iv) the mapping between the an 1 calogero model and free harmonic oscillators is rederived

using the present method, and, nally, (v) we show, the equivalence of the sutherland model

with free particles on a circle.

consider the following dierential equation,

(f (d) + p (x, d/dx)) y(x) = 0 ,

(1)

where, d  x d

dx , f (d) = pn=

spanned by xn and ans are some parameters. p (x, d/dx) can be an arbitrary polynomial

n= andn, is a diagonal operator in the space of monomials

y(x) = c(

f (d)

,

(2)

is a solution of the above equation, provided, f (d)x = 0 and the coecient of x in

y(x)  cx is zero (no summation over ); here, c is a constant. the case, when the

equation f (d)x = 0 does not have distinct roots is not considered here and will be treated

separately elsewhere.

eq. (2), which connects the solution of a given dierential equation to the monomials,

can also be generalized to many-variables. in order to show that, this rather straightforward

procedure indeed yields non-trivial results, we explicitly work out a few examples below and

then proceed to prove the equivalence of the sutherland model to free particles on a circle.

consider the hermite dierential equation, which arises in the context of quantum har-

monic oscillator,

 d  n

dx2! hn(x) = 0

.

(4)

here, f (d) = d  n and f (d)x = 0 yields  = n. hence,

hn(x) = cn

(5)

using, [d , (d2/dx2)] = 2(d2/dx2), it is easy to see that,

(6)

this is a well-known result. similar expression also holds for the lagurre polynomials which

matches with the one found in [20].

in order to make an important remark, we list the

solutions of some frequently encountered dierential equations in various branches of physics

[21].

legendre polynomials

pn(x) = cne{1/(2[d+n+1])}(d2/dx2) xn

.

associated legendre polynomials

n (x) = cn(1  x2)m/2e{1/(2[d+n+m+1])}(d2/dx2) xnm

,

where,  is either  or  and a  x d2

dx2 + d

dx . all the above series solutions have descending

powers of x. in order to get the series in the ascending powers, one has to replace x by 1

x in the

original dierential equation and generate the solutions via eq. (2). however, the number

of solutions will remain the same. one can also generate the series solutions by multiplying

the original dierential equations with x2, and then, rewriting x2 d2

dx2 = d(d  1) = f (d).

the cases of struve, lomel, anger and weber functions are identical to the above one. jacobi,

schlai, whittaker, chebyshev and some other polynomials were not given here since the

list is rather lengthy. now, the remark follows: g becomes independent of the roots of the

equation f (d)x = 0, only when f (d) is linear in d.

the solution for the following equation with periodic potential,

d2y
dx2 + a cos(x)y = 0

,

can be found, after multiplying eq. (7) by x2 and rewriting x2 d2

dx2 as (d  1)d, to be

(8)

where,  = 0 or 1. in the same manner, one can write down the solutions for the mathieus

equation as well [21].

using this method, one can, in principle write down the ground and rst excited states

of the one variable schrodinger equation. we rst illustrate the procedure for harmonic

oscillator, (h = m =  = 1),

  d2
dx2 + (2en  x2)! n = 0

,

(9)

before proceeding to the other non-trivial examples. multiplying by x2, the above can be

written as

(cid:16)(d  1)d + x2(2en  x2)(cid:17) n = 0

.

(10)

for n = 0 and 1, d(d  1)xn = 0. using eq. (2), the solution for n = 0 is,

0 = c0( 
xm=0

(11)

note that, 0 is an expansion in the powers of x, whose coecients are polynomials in e0.

only when e0 = 1/2, the series can be written in the closed form c0e 1

2 x2

, which satises all

properties required for a quantum mechanical ground-state. similarly, the rst excited state

can also be found by applying g1 on x. to nd the n-th excited state, one can dierentiate

the schrodinger equation n times, multiply it by xn and use xn dn

l=0 (d  l) = f (d).

dxn = qn1

in the case of complicated potentials, this method can be potentially very useful if applied

in conjunction with numerical algorithms. the exact ground-state wavefunction for the

schrodinger equation with anharmonic potential, v (x) = x2/2 + cx4/2, is,

0 = c0( 
xm=0

(1)m"

1

(d  1)d

(x2(2e0  x2  cx4))#m) .1

.

(12)

one can numerically tune e0 to obtain an appropriate 0.

in the following, we apply the above technique to the dierential equations involving

many variables. consider, the an 1 calogero-sutherland model, which was made equivalent

to free harmonic oscillators [16],

in order to avoid the possibility of having singular solutions when the inverse of (pi xi

acts on sn({xi}), we choose n + e0  en = 0; this yields the familiar energy spectrum of the

calogero-sutherland model. further, one has to choose sn({xi}) to be completely symmetric

under the exchange of xis, such that, the action of a yields polynomial solutions which are

normalizable with respect to 0 as the weight function [16,22]. similar to the case of the

hermite polynomial, one can easily prove that,

(25)

this is the desired result. earlier, lapointe et al. have obtained a rodrigues-type formulae

for the jack polynomials [27]. eq. (24) is a new formula for the jack polynomials. in the

following, we show that, the above method can be generalized to more general many-body

systems.

where, ans are some parameters, di is same as the above, a is a function of zi and /zi

and b({zi}) is a source term.

case (i) when b({zi}) = 0 and am = m +p< cm; where, ms are the monomial

(28)

in conclusion, we have developed a general method to solve any linear dierential equa-

tion of arbitrary order. the major advantage of this technique lies in the fact that, in order

to obtain the solutions, one does not have to solve any recursion relations or integral equa-

tions. by applying this method, we obtained new formulae for many dierential equations

which are of interest to theoretical physicists. we also discussed how to obtain the ground

and excited states for the schrodinger equations with complicated potentials. in particu-

lar, we have written down the exact ground-state wavefunction for anharmonic potential,

v (x) = x2/2 + cx4/2, as a function of energy parameter, which has to be tuned to obtain

the normalizable solutions. this method treated both an 1 calogero-sutherland and the

sutherland model with inverse sine-square interactions on the equal footing. the former one

is equivalent to free harmonic oscillators and the later, to free particles on a circle. we also

proposed a general scheme for generating more general symmetric functions. this scheme

may nd interesting applications in the context of obtaining the q-deformed versions of the

known polynomials [21,25].
