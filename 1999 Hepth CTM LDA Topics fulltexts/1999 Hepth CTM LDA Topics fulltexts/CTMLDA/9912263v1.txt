abstract

the canonical adm equations are solved in terms of the conformal factor in the

instantaneous york gauge. a simple derivation is given for the solution of the two

body problem. a geometrical characterization is given for the apparent singularities
occurring in the n -body problem and it is shown how the garnier hamiltonian system
arises in the adm treatment by considering the time development of the conformal

factor at the locations where the extrinsic curvature tensor vanishes. the equations of

motion for the position of the particles and of the apparent singularities and also the

time dependence of the linear residues at such singularities are given by the transfor-

mation induced by an energy momentum tensor of a conformal liouville theory. such

an equation encodes completely the dynamics of the system.

1 introduction

the problem of providing solutions to 2 + 1 dimensional gravity [1] has been approached

along dierent lines. in absence of particles the dynamics becomes non trivial only for closed

universes of genus higher or equal to one. moncrief [2] and hosoya and nakao [3] gave the

hamiltonian treatment of this problem providing the complete reduction of the hamiltonian

to the physical parameters i.e. the moduli of the time slices. this procedure was obtained

in the york k = t gauge; in the case of the torus the problem can be dealt with explicitly

while for higher genus, even if the problem is well dened we do not posses an explicit form

for the reduced hamiltonian.

a dierent approach was put forward by t hooft [4] by describing the evolving cauchy

surfaces in terms of polygonal tiles which join along segments where the extrinsic curvature

is singular. the dynamics of the system is codied in transition rules which intervene when

e.g. the length of a side of a polygon goes to zero or when a particle collides with a side of

a polygon. such an approach is applicable both in presence and in absence of particle and

it is suitable for an algorithmic or numeric approach. a similar but dierent approach was

given by waelbroek [5].

1

in presence of particles progress was made in the papers by bellini, ciafaloni and val-

tancoli [6] and by welling [7] in the rst order formalism by going over to the instantaneous

(k = 0) gauge; in these papers it was shown that the problem is equivalent to a riemann-

hilbert problem. it can be solved explicitly for the case of two particles, in terms of hy-

pergeometric functions. for three or more particles one encounters a feature known in the

mathematical literature as apparent singularities.

in this paper we shall consider 2 + 1 dimensional gravity in presence of massive particles

by exploiting the hamiltonian formulation. thus our setting is a second order formalism and

the basic equations are those derived systematically from the variation of the adm action.

the reason for such a development is to give a treatment which resides completely within

the canonical framework. all results obtained in [6] [7] come out in simple fashion from such

an approach; moreover we shall prove that the garnier hamiltonian system for the apparent

singularities is a direct outcome of the canonical adm formalism. again the exploitation of

the instantaneous york gauge plays a major role; the technical advantage of such a gauge

is to reduce an equation of sinh-gordon to one of liouville type to which powerful methods

of complex analysis apply. unfortunately the applicability of such a gauge is restricted to

open universes.

we shall see that the described approach provides an elementary way to solve the two

body problem: the exact solution of the motion can be derived even before the explicit

computation of the metric; combined with the qualitative knowledge of the asymptotic

metric it gives a complete description of the scattering. the exact metric is obtained by

solving a liouville equation, leading of course to the same results obtained in [6] and [7].

one of the aims of presenting a canonical solution of the problem is to provide a framework

for the quantization of the theory even if here we shall conne ourselves to the classical

problem.

quantization schemes for 2 + 1 dimensional gravity in absence of particles have been

proposed in [8, 9, 10] and in presence of particles in [11, 12, 13].

the key quantity of our approach will be the conformal factor which describes the metric

of the time slices. the lapse function n is given by the derivative of such conformal factor

2

with respect to the total energy and the shift functions are given in terms of derivatives of

the lapse function.

as mentioned above, with more than two particles there are apparent singularities and

one has to provide evolution equations for their positions and residues. we show that all this

information in contained in the adm equation for the time derivative of the conformal factor.

in fact by exploiting schwarzs relation between the coecient of the fuchsian dierential

equation and the reduced conformal factor one obtains the garnier equation by equating the

residues at the polar singularities at the position of the apparent singularities.

in the present paper we shall outline the main features of the approach; technical details

are found in ref.[14].

fundamental form of the time slices t and ij the second fundamental form of the lateral

boundary b whose volume form is ; n is the future pointing unit normal to the time
slices and u the outward pointing unit normal to b; bt = t  b,  is the volume form

induced on bt and sinh  = nu. the boundary terms are going to play a fundamental role

in the computation of the reduced action; this paper however will be based completely on

the equations of motion which do not depend on the explicit form of the boundary terms.

where we have introduced the momenta ij canonically conjugate to gij. similarly the matter

3 the constraints

in (2+1)dimensions, the great advantage of a york-type gauge, ik = 0, is to ensure, when
combined with the conformal gauge gij = exp(2)ij, the decoupling of the traceless part
t ij of the momentum from the spatial metric in the dieomorphism constraints5. indeed,

5this decoupling reects the fact that the divergence of a traceless symmetric tensorial density of rank

eq.(7) holds for  z

n + pni gijpnj = 0.

if we integrate the l.h.s of eq.(8) over a slice of constant time, an elementary application

of the gauss-bonnet theorem shows that the condition k = 0 is consistent only with open

universes or with closed universes of genus 0. in the latter case consistency can be achieved

only for static universes as it will be shown in sect.4. moreover, for open universes, eq.(8)

determines the asymptotic behavior of the momenta i
j in terms of that of . in fact if
we assume that the asymptotic metric has to be conical, e2  (zz),  > 0, the above
equation implies that

z d2z 2z

z z

z exp(2) < .

this, in turn, entails that  z
of having a conical metric at innity sets the function p z

z at innity vanishes faster than 1/z. thus, the requirement
z(z) to zero and in addition it

up with a  z

imposes that pn pnz = 0. because of the explicit form of the solution (7), we actually end

z that goes to zero as 1/z2. as a consequence, if we dene, mimicking the four
dimensional counterpart, the total momentum ptot of the system as the surface integral of
i

j, we are led to conclude that ptot vanishes identically. it is worth noticing that in the

present gauge ptot is simply equal to pn pn and no gravitational correction appears. the
clash in (2 + 1)dimensions between the boundary conditions ensuring nite energy and
those ensuring nite momentum was rst noticed in [18, 19, 20]. in particular, in [19] the

origin of this conict was traced back to the impossibility of performing asymptotic boosts

without introducing spurious singularities in the metric.

we return now to eq.(8).

it is not dicult to show [14] that e2 vanishes on the

particle singularities and as a result the hamiltonian constraint assumes the form, after

5

setting 2 = 2  ln(2 z

zz

z)

2 =

(9)

e2 xb

42(z  zb) +xn

2(z  zn)mn.

the above equation is an inhomogeneous liouville equation. the sources are given by the
particles and by some other auxiliary sources whose position zb are the zeros of  z
z and their
strength is xed to 4. the conformal factor  is actually regular at the points zb and for
this reason we shall refer to them as apparent singularities.

we remark that the reduction of the hamiltonian constraint to a liouville equation is
the result of the k = 0 condition. the k = const 6= 0 gauge gives rise, as seen from eq.(8)
to an equation of the sinh-gordon family which is of much more complex nature.

finally we note that the conformal gauge i.e. gij = e2ij is still not a complete gauge

xing. one is allowed to perform analytic transformation on z which leave, in the case of

open universe, the point at innity xed i.e. time dependent translations, rotations and

dilatations. this freedom can be exploited e.g. to keep one particle xed at z1 = 0 and

an other xed at z2 = 1. in general such a xing is equivalent to a frame which rotates at

innity.

4 equations for the lapse and shift functions

before discussing the solutions of the inhomogeneous liouville equation we shall write down
the equations for n and n i; these are an outcome of requiring that the gauge conditions are

preserved in the hamiltonian evolution. combining the canonical equation for ij and the
one for gij the relation k = 0 (or equivalently i

i = 0) takes the form

n = e2n.

(10)

again we have exploited the vanishing of e2 at the particle sources [14]. since we have
chosen the conformal gauge, the traceless part of the equation for gij determines n i, i.e.

z e2n

zn z = z
6

(11)

and its complex conjugate. these complete the list of our equations for the metric. by

applying gauss theorem to eq.(10) one easily derives the asymptotic behavior of n for large
|z|

n  ln(zz).

(12)

such an asymptotic behavior of the lapse function is typical of the instantaneous york gauge
and should be contrasted with the behavior n  const. of the familiar djh gauge [1]. the
behavior (12) holds both when the plane describes the time slice of an open universe and

when it describes the sphere; but in the latter case in order for the scalar n to be well

dened on the riemann sphere is should go to a constant at innity. this occurs only for
i
j  0 i.e. when the equation for n reduces to n = 0. thus we see that except for the
trivial stationary case in which pn = 0 the york instantaneous gauge applies only to open

universes.

5 the liouville equation

as is well known, the problem of solving the inhomogeneous liouville equation (9) can

be reduced to that of solving a fuchsian second order dierential equation of projectively

canonical type [21]

where

y() + q()y() = 0

if we dene the function f (z) as the ratio of two independent solutions of eq. (13),

f (z) =

ky1(z)
y2(z)

,

7

(13)

(14)

(15)

the solution of eq. (9) is built from the poincare metric for the pseudosphere by performing

on it the conformal dieomorphism dened by eq. (15)

e2 =

8f (z) f (z)
(1  f (z) f (z))2 .

(16)

the poles in (14) include both particle and apparent singularities. the residues of the second

order poles in q(z) are directly related to the strength of the delta singularities in eq.(9):

in fact, n = mn/4 while the second order residue at the apparent singularities is xed
to be 3/4. the latter value is required by the regularity of 2 at zb. the determination
of the rst order residues is more dicult and it is related to the knowledge of the explicit

solution of the riemann-hilbert problem associated to (13). they are xed in principle

by the requirement that the conformal factor  be monodromic in the complex plane. as

eq.(16) can be rewritten in the form

e2 =

8w12 w12

(y2y2  kk y1 y1)2

(17)

where w12 is the constant wronskian, it is seen that such a requirement is equivalent to the

imposition that the vector (ky1, y2) transforms under a representation of su(1, 1) when one

encircles a singularity in the complex plane. it provides the relation between the geometric

structure approach [22] and the one here described.

an important feature in the solution of eq.(9) is that one has to give the residue of the

singularity at innity and this information is not contained in the parameters appearing

in the sources. in dierent words, in solving eq.(9) the total energy of the system has to

be specied as an arbitrary parameter m because the positions and the momenta of the

particles at the initial time are not enough to determine its value. the above conclusion

might seem counterintuitive especially if we compare it with what happens in the djh

geometrical approach, where the knowledge of all zi and pi xes m completely through a

nonlinear composition rule for the momenta. this apparent mismatch simply reects their

choice to have, in contrast with the present approach [6, 7, 14], a at (not globally dened)

metric. as a consequence, in their approach, all the dynamical information is shifted into

the particle variables. in our approach a complete set of initial conditions for the conformal

8

factor  is instead provided by any unconstrained parameterization6 of the rational function

q(z): an example will be given in sec. 9.

the conformal factor 2 plays the key role in all subsequent developments; once the
solution of eq.(9) is known the equations for n and n i are solved as follows. as the sources

in eq.(9) do not depend on the total energy m, by taking the derivative with respect to

m we nd a solution to the homogeneous equation (10) for n i.e. apart for an arbitrary

normalization constant we have

n =

.

as for the equation (11) multiplying it by 2 z
that  z

z is a function of z we get

(2)
m
z and using eq.(10) and taking into account

(18)

n z = 

2
z(z)

 z

zn + g(z)

(19)

where g(z) is a function of z. a similar solution holds for n z. the function g(z) has to be
chosen as to cancel the poles generated by the zeros of  z

z(z), which occur only in presence
of three or more particles, and if we are interested in describing a reference system which
does not rotate at innity g(z) has to be chosen as to give n z < |z| at innity. we shall see
in sect.7 that, due to pn pnz = 0, such a function can diverge at innity at most linearly.

as we shall see g(z) encodes the time evolution of all the quantities of the problem.

6 the particle equations of motion

the canonical equations for the particle positions zn and momenta pn are obtained by varying

the action with respect to zn and pn and are given by

zn = n i(zn, t) = g(zn),

(20)

6 in fact the n and a are not all independent: in the next section we shall see that fuchsianity and

the value of the residue at innity impose two sum rule on them. moreover, the requirement that conformal

factor  be regular at za xes the a in terms of the other parameters by means of the so-called no-log

condition, see sec.9.

(21)

and their complex conjugate expressions. we note that zn is simply given in terms of the
meromorphic function g(z) as in eq.(19)  z

z diverges at the particle positions while zn stays
nite. it is of interest that the r.h.s of eq.(21) depends only on the function g(z) and on the

linear residue n at the particle singularity. in fact by using the behavior of the solutions

eq.(13) at the particle singularities, one obtains

pnz = 4

n

+ pnzg(zn).

(22)

the fact that the time evolution is governed by the function g(z) will be the common

denominator of the following developments.

7 conservation laws

for a fuchsian dierential equation of type (13) the following fuchs relations hold [23]

xn
n +xb
(1  2

b = 0;

1  2

(3 + 2bzb).

(23)

the former expresses the fact that the function q(z) behaves as 1/z2 at innity (fuchs

condition); the latter provides the second order residue of q(z) at innity (the total mass of

the system) in terms of the other parameters.

below, we shall shows that these conditions implie some non-trivial conservation laws.

we start recalling the equation of motion for  z
z

z = 2e2z(e2zn) + 2 z

which by means of the eqs.(18) and (19) can be recasted as follows

(25)

we have used a standard result about the liouville equation that permits to connect  to

q(z)

q(z) =

[2

(z(2))2].

(26)

in a eld theoretical language q(z) is proportional to the energy momentum tensor associated

to the liouville equation.

if we integrate both sides of eq.(25) over a closed path in the complex plane that encircles

all the singularities, we nd

(27)

since both the sum over momenta and that over the rst order residues vanish, the remaining
integral must vanish as well. recalling that  z
z  1/z2 for large radius, we must conclude
that g can grow at most linearly at innity. moreover, if we combine this information with

the fact that the only singularities of g at nite radius can be poles, we nd that g must be

a rational function.

next, we multiply eq.(25) by z and we integrate again over a closed path in the complex

plane to obtain

11

(29)

(30)

the fact that the terms depending on g in eq.(25) do not contribute can be easily seen if we

write the r.h.s of (25) times z in the form

 4zm q(z) +  z

z(zzg  g) + z(z z

zg).

(31)

the last term is harmless since it is a total derivative of a rational function; the previous
one falls again as 1/z2 since the combination (zzg  g) cancels the linear behavior of g at
innity.

eq.(28) is a severe constraint on the form of the reduced hamiltonian h describing the

motion of the particles when gravity is eliminated. in fact pn pnz = 0 imposes

h = h(2, . . . n , p2, . . . pn )

with n = zn  z1 and eq.(28) imposes that
h
pnz  n

xn>1 pnz

n! = 1 
h

.

the general solution of this equation has the form

h = xn>1(cid:16)log(pnzpnz) + log(n n)n(cid:17) + h0

(32)

(33)

(34)

where h0 is a homogeneous function of degree zero in the variables pnz and 1/n andpn>1(1
n) = 1  m
4 . this property will be seen explicitly realized for two particles with h0 = 0.

8 the two body problem

in the two body problem,  z
z has no zero i.e. we are in absence of apparent singularities;
g(z) = z/p1z(z2  z1) in order to have a non rotating frame at innity. the simple residues
1, 2 are provided by the fuchs relations in terms of particle masses m1, m2 and the total

energy. f appearing in eq.(16) is given by the ratio of two hypergeometric functions which

provides the metric [6, 7, 14]. on the other hand it is interesting that the particle trajectories

can be determined even before the explicit computation of the metric. in fact we have for

12

the two particles the equation of motion (20,21). the rewriting of the two formulas for the
problem at hand gives for l = z1  z2 and pz = p1z = p2z

whose general solution is

l =

1
pz

,

pz = 


l

l = const [(1  )(t  t0)  il/2]

1

1 .

(35)

(36)

the scattering angle is immediately computed from the previous equation to be scatt =
m/(4  m) [1, 24]. it is interesting to note that the scattering angle depends only on the
total energy and not on the masses of the individual particles. the two equations (35) are

generated by the hamiltonian hef f = ln(p 2

y) which is unique up to an
additive constant. such an hamiltonian should not be confused with the total energy of the

x + l2

x + p 2

y ) +  ln(l2

system; it is the eective hamiltonian for the time development of the two particle system

and contains as an essential parameter the total energy m = 4.

9 the n body problem
we shall consider in this section the n -particle case with particular attention to n = 3.
in at space the number of lorentz invariants is easily seen to be 3n  3 as for n > 3
the 2 + 1-vector pn is determined by the scalar product of pn with p1, p2, p3. in curved

space we have the same number of invariants. as it is well known here the invariants are

replaced by the traces of the holonomies around the world lines of an arbitrary collection of

particles [1, 25, 26]. the parallel transport monodromy matrices which belong to so(2, 1)

or in the fundamental representation to su(1, 1) are dened up to a conjugation. keeping in
mind that every su(1, 1) holonomy has three real degrees of freedom we have 3n degrees of
freedom to which we have to subtract the three degrees of freedom of the su(1, 1) conjugation

thus reaching as expected the same number of invariants as in the at case.

in the present approach parameterizing the dynamics in terms of the position of the par-

ticles and their momenta is not a convenient choice, because these, as we have anticipated,

13

are not the natural variables for the associated riemann-hilbert problem. in order to un-
derstand the problem better let us consider the case n = 3. it is useful to go over from the
equation in projectively canonical form (13) to the equivalent one presented below [23]

thus we have the following free real parameters 1, 2, 3, , re(za), im(za), re(ba), im(ba)

which are eight real parameters, to be contrasted with the six real invariants we have enumer-

ated at the beginning of this section. the reason is that the constraint that the holonomies

described by eq.(37) belong to su(1, 1), xes the value of re(ba), im(ba) in terms of all

other parameters. the explicit form of this relation has been investigated in the mathemat-

ical literature [28] but we are not aware of any explicit form of it. adding a new particle

introduces a new particle singularity with exponent 4 i.e. p(z) acquires a new term of the
type (1  4)/(z  z4), but in addition a new apparent singularity is generated say at zb.
the indices of this new singularity have to be integers, 0 and 2 while the new simple residue

bb has to be a function of all other parameters, and in particular of zb, because the su(1, 1)

character of the holonomies allow only an increase of 3 in the number of free real parameters

i.e. 4, rezb, imzb. adding other particles does not alter the procedure.

the complete solution of the dynamical problem requires that we provide the equations

of motion for all the variables parameterizing the dynamics of the system and in particular

for the apparent singularities and their rst order residues. to this purpose, we shall follow

here a synthetic approach which will encode in a single equation all the information on the

time development of the positions and residues of all singularities. to accomplish this we

shall exploit the trace part of equation for gij i.e.

d(2)

dt

= n zz(2) + zn z + n zz(2) + zn z

(42)

which combined with the time development of  z

z(z), eq.(24), provides the time derivative

of the reduced conformal factor  i.e.

2  = g(z)z(2)  g(z) + c.c.

(43)

15

we shall exploit now the fundamental relation (26) of the theory of fuchsian dierential

equation [23, 21]. taking the time derivative of eq.(26) we have

q(z) =

1
2

g(z) + 2g(z)q(z) + g(z)q(z).

(44)

the above equation implies that the time development of q(z) is given by a conformal

dieomorphism generated by q(z) itself. we are not in presence of a classical transformation

but of an anomalous one. extensions of the classical liouville theory have been considered

in [27].

it is interesting that this equation, in addition to the particle equations of motion, con-

tains the whole garnier system for the time evolution of the apparent singularities. we recall

that g(z) is the rational function introduced in eq.(21); it is given by a sum of simple poles

located at the apparent singularities and of a rst order polynomial.

equating the simple residue of eq.(44) at innity one simply obtains

d
dt

(xn

n +xb

b) = 0

(45)

which is already contained in the fuchs relation (23), while equating the second order residues

at innity we obtain

d

dt "xn

(1  2

n) + 2xn

nzn + 2xb

bzb# = 0

which using the second fuchs relation (23) provides d2

/dt = 0, where  = 1  m/4 i.e.
the conservation of total energy. on the other hand if we equate the second order residues of

eq.(44) at the particle pole zn we obtain d2

n/dt = 0, where n = mn/4 i.e. the conservation
of the individual particle rest masses. matching of the third order residue on the particle

singularity zn gives

zn = g(zn)
while matching of the rst order residue gives n i.e.

n =

1  2

n

2

g(zn) + g(zn)n.

16

(46)

(47)

the motion of the apparent singularities is given by the matching of the residues of the third

order pole at za. if we laurent expand g(z) around za

g(z) =

g1
z  za

+ g0 + g1(z  za) + o((z  za)2)

we obtain

while the rst order pole gives

za = g1a  g0

a = 2g1q

a(za) + g1a 

3
2

g2.

(48)

(49)

(50)

equations (49) and (50) can be written in hamiltonian form; for example in the three body

problem, by choosing g(z) as to cancel the pole in eq.(19) and keep particle 1 xed at z1 = 0

and particle 2 xed at z2 = 1, we have

za
z3

=

(cid:20)a 

and

za(za  1)(za  z3)

z3(z3  1)
za(cid:21) =

1

1

za  1 


h
ba

a
z3

= 

h
za

.

(51)

(52)

where h is the so called garnier hamiltonian and it given by (41). the parameter a is

connected to those appearing in h by the relation with
1  2
za  1

2 (cid:18)1  1

= ba +

a

za

+

1  3
za  z3(cid:19) .

(53)

the explicit expression of h can also be written for the general n body problem.

it is now possible to interpret the problem of gravity in presence of particles `a la einstein-

infeld- homann [29] i.e. as pure gravity without particles in which one allows for singular

solutions of the eld equations. what we found is that the decit of the singularity has to

remain constant (equivalent to the constancy of rest masses), the total angular decit has to

remain constant (equivalent to the constancy of the total energy) and the eld singularities

follow geodesics of space- time.

10 conclusions

the application of the instantaneous york gauge k = 0, to 2 + 1 dimensional gravity

is practically restricted to the case of open universes; on the other hand in this case the
advantages are several and profound. the momenta a

b conjugate to the space metric have
only two independent components and the dieomorphism constraint has a very simple

solution i.e.

momenta pn.

the  z

z (z

z) are rational functions of z (z) whose residues are the particle

the advantage is still greater with regard to the hamiltonian constraint which in this

gauge is equivalent to an inhomogeneous liouville equation for the reduced conformal factor
; the sources are the particle singularities i.e. the poles of  z

z and the apparent singularities,
z. the function n is given by the derivative of  with respect to the total

i.e. the zeros of  z
energy while n z is given in terms of n by

n z = 

2
 z
z

zn + g(z),

(54)

where g(z) is a rational function which cancels the polar singularities of the rst term and

grows at innity not faster than z. the linear term in g(z) is xed if we want to deal with

a reference frame which does not rotate at innity.

the equations of motion for the position of the particles and of the apparent singularities

and also the time dependence of the linear residues at such singularities are given by the time

development of the function q(z) entering the fuchsian dierential equation which underlies

the conformal factor describing the space metric. such a time development is given by the

energy momentum tensor of a conformal liouville theory and it encodes completely the

dynamics of the system.
