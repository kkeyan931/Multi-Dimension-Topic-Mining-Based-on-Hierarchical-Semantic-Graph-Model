anomalies for nonlocal dirac operators

e-18071 granada, spain

abstract. the anomalies of a very general class of non local dirac operators are com-
puted using the -function denition of the fermionic determinant and an asymmetric
version of the wigner transformation. for the axial anomaly all new terms introduced
by the non locality can be brought to the standard minimal bardeens form. some
extensions of the present techniques are also commented.

introduction

local eld theories provide the commonly accepted setup where the implementa-
tion of space-time symmetries becomes rather simple. on the other hand, eective
theories are not necessarily local, although an appropriate choice of degrees of free-
dom can make them almost local [1]. in low energy qcd, light quarks and gluons
are dressed by the interaction in a way that the eective theory looks highly nonlo-
cal [2], and a kind of dynamical perturbation theory would be needed [3]. in terms
of pions and (heavy) nucleons the theory becomes weakly nonlocal and a chiral
perturbation theory becomes of practical interest [4]. in a dyson-schwinger setting
[5] most information about such a non local theory comes from the constraints im-
posed by the relevant ward and slavnov-taylor identities [5], perturbation theory
to some nite order and hadronic phenomenology. these approaches are necessary
if one wants to know, for instance, about the momentum distribution of a quark in
a hadron; neither perturbative qcd nor chiral perturbation theory can properly
handle this problem. in this regard, anomalies are particulary interesting because
their existence is linked to a violation of classical symmetries by high energy regu-
lators although their physical eect is formulated as a low energy theorem. at the
one loop level, anomalies for nonlocal models have been previously discussed [68]
for some specic processes like e.g. 0  2,   3 and 2k  3. we refer
to those works and [9] for further motivation. rather than computing all specic
processes one by one we prove that the new terms generated by the non locality
can be subtracted by adding suitable counterterms.

i the one loop effective action

our starting point is the eective action of dirac fermions in the at euclidean
space-time endowed with internal degrees of freedom collectively referred to as
avor,

w (d) =  logz d d exp(cid:26)z ddx (x)d(x)(cid:27) = tr log d .

(1)

here, tr stands for trace over all degrees of freedom and d is the dirac operator to
be specied below. the denition of the fermion determinant requires some renor-
malization of the ultraviolet divergences. the (consistent) chiral anomaly is dened
as the variation of the eective action under innitesimal chiral transformations,
given by

(x)  eii5(x) ,

(x)  (x)eii5

(2)

where (x) and (x) are hermitian matrices in avor space only, regarded as multi-
plicative operators on the fermionic wave functions. the particular cases  = 0 and
 = 0 correspond to vector and axial transformations, respectively. this induces
transformations of the dirac operator

d  eii5 deii5 ,

which innitesimally become

d = v d + ad = [i, d]  {i5, d} .

(3)

(4)

since we will be considering a -function renormalization of w (see below), there
will be no vector anomaly,

v w = 0,

aw = aa .

(5)

correspondingly, the same current conservation formulas valid for the local case
can be written here,

0 = z ddx h (x)[i, d](x)iq

aa = z ddx h (x){i5, d}(x)iq .

(6)

(7)

(the symbol h iq stands for quantum vacuum expectation value.) in particular
the term p in d in the right-hand side yields, after integration by parts, the
divergence of the fermionic vector and axial currents whereas the other terms in
d, local and non local, represent the explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to the
external elds. on the other hand, the left-hand side shows the anomalous breaking
of the axial current conservation.

the class of dirac operators to be considered here is

d = dl + m .

the term dl, the local component of d, is a standard dirac operator

dl = p + y

(8)

(9)

we will follow the conventions of [10,11]), p = i and y is an arbitrary matrix-
valued function in avor and dirac spaces. y is a function of the position operators
x, dened by x(x) = x(x), so that y is a multiplicative operator in the
hilbert space of fermions. the term m is a purely non local 2 , more precisely
bilocal, operator also with arbitrary structure in avor and dirac spaces,

(y )(x) = y (x)(x) ,

(m )(x) = z ddym (x, y)(y) .

(10)

more restrictive assumptions on m are spelled out in ref. [11]. for the purpose of
doing detailed calculations we will assume that the non local operator m admits
an expansion in inverse powers of p for large p of the form

m = m 

p
p 2 + m 

pp
p 4 + m 

ppp

p 6 +   

(11)

the coecients m 1...n are multiplicative operators and they are completely sym-
metric under permutation of indices. for convenience the p has been put at the
right 3. the better way to obtain the transformation properties of m is by intro-
ducing a family of operators associated to m as

m (p) = eipxm eipx

(12)

where the momentum p is just a constant c-number. eectively, m (p) corresponds
to make the replacement p  p + p in m . the function m (p) admits an
expansion in inverse powers of p similar to that in eq. (11), namely

m (p) = m 

p
p2 + m 

pp
p4 +    .

(13)

we will adopt the -function renormalization prescription combined with an
asymmetric wigner transformation. this method, as well as several of its ap-
plications, is presented in great detail in [10]. the -function eective action is
given by [13,14]

2) m is softer in the ultraviolet sector than any multiplicative operator, that is, the distribution
m (x, y) is less singular than the dirac delta (x  y).
3) this choice does not exhaust all possible non local operators, but it is realistic since it ac-
commodates the operator product expansion estimate of the quark self-energy (p2) p2
(logp2)d1/p2 with d the anomalous dimension of the quark condensate  (see ref. [12])

w (d) = tr log d =

tr (ds)s=0 ,

(14)

where s = 0 is to be understood as an analytical extension on s from the ultraviolet
convergent region re(s) < d. the operator ds can be obtained from

ds = z

dz
2i

zs

d  z

(15)

where the integration path  starts at , follows the real negative axis, encircles
the origin z = 0 clockwise and goes back to  (see gure 1). the key point
is that for suciently negative s there are no ultraviolet divergences and formal
operations become justied. by construction, the -function renormalized eec-
tive action is invariant under all symmetry transformations associated to similarity
transformations of d, thus in particular it is vector gauge invariant. on the other
hand, the variable z plays the role of a mass and hence breaks explicitly both chiral
and scale invariance.

the operator (dz)1 can be conveniently expressed by means of an asymmetric

version of the wigner representation [15]. for any operator a, let

a(x, p) = z ddy eiyphx|a|x  yi =

hx|a|pi

hx|pi

(16)

be its (asymmetric) wigner representation.
hx|pi = eixp. from this denition

|pi is the momentum eigenstate with

hx|a|xi = z

(2)d tra(x, p) ,

(17)

where tr acts on internal and dirac spinor degrees of freedom only, and the product
of two operators satisfy the following formula

(ab)(x, p) = exp(ia

p  b

x )a(x, p)b(x, p) ,

(18)

p acts only on the p-dependence in a(x, p) and b

where a
x on the x-dependence in
b(x, p). let the propagator or resolvent of d, be g(z) = (d  z)1 and g(x, p; z)
its wigner representation. applying eq.18 to (d  z)g = 1 one obtains

g(x, p; z) = hx|(p/ +d  z)1|0i

(19)

where |0i is the state of zero momentum, hx|0i = 1. in practice this implies that
i derivates every x dependence at is right, until it annihilates |0i, i|0i = 0.
this method is very ecient for a derivative expansion for it computes directly,
that is non recursively, each of the terms [10].

the denition given for a(x, p) is not gauge covariant because |pi is not. we will

consider only local objects of the form hx|f (d)|xi as given by the formula

hx|f (d)|xi = z

ddp
(2)d z

dz
2i

f (z)g(x, p; z)

(3.7)

we will assume that the function f (z) is suciently convergent at innity or else
that it can be obtained as a suitable analytical extrapolation from a parametric
family f (z, s) in the variable s.
in either case the integration over z should be
performed in the rst place, to yield the wigner representation of the operator
f (d). afterwards, the p integration is carried out, corresponding to take the
diagonal matrix elements of hy|f (d)|xi, hence restoring gauge covariance. this
obviously means that the gauge breaking piece of g(x, p; z) is a total derivative in
the momentum variable. recently, a method has been developped [16] where this
total derivative is, by construction, gauge invariant.

ii anomalies

because the chiral transformations are local, both dl and m transform covari-

antly separately, that is,

dl = [i, dl]  {i5, dl} ,

m = [i, m ]  {i5, m } .

(20)

note that the bilocal structure of m implies that local
side of
ei(x)i(x)5m (x, x)ei(x)i(x)5.

the operator are taken at dierent points,

factors at each
i.e. m (x, x) 

the two lowest coecients are given by

m  = m  ,

m  = m  + tm p ,

(21)

where we have introduced t =     .
it should be noted
that the coecients m 1...n are not multiplicative operators. one useful property
of m (p) is that it transforms covariantly under chiral transformations. indeed, if
m  = 1m 2 for two multiplicative operators 1,2,

m (p) = eipxm eipx = 1 m (p)2 .

(22)

as a consequence, the coecients are also chiral covariant

 m 1...n = [i, m 1...n]  {i5, m 1...n} .

(23)

from here it is immediate to derive the transformation of the original coecients
m 1...n. for the two lowest order coecients one nds

m  = [i, m ]  {i5, m } ,
m  = [i, m ]  {i5, m } + tm ( + 5) .

(24)

in general, the variation of each coecient involves those of lower order.

the scale transformation (x)  es(d1)/2(es x) induces the corresponding

transformation in d, namely,

y (x)  es y (es x) , m 1...n(x)  es (n+1)m 1...n(es x) .

(25)

innitesimally, it implies

sd = s(d  i[xp, d]) .

(26)

a chiral anomaly

due to the  regularization the chiral anomaly becomes an axial anomaly,

aa = tr (2i5ds)s=0 .

(27)

using the wigner transformation technique [10], the anomaly can be written as (a
similar expression holds for the eective action)

aa = z

ddp
(2)d z

dz
2i

(28)

|0i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0

here tr stands for trace over dirac and avor degrees of freedom, |0i is the zero
momentum state normalized as hx|0i = 1, thus p|0i = h0|p = 0. further

d(p) = eipxdeipx =p/ +dl + m (p) .

(29)

the integration over z should be performed rst, since it denes the operator ds,
then the integral over p which corresponds to take the trace over space-time degrees
of freedom and nally s is to be analytically extended to s = 0. the simplest way
to proceed is to introduce a mass term, i.e., to apply the formula to the dirac
operator d + m and then make an expansion in powers of dl + m (p), letting
m  0 at the end. in this way the following expression is derived

aa = xn 0

.

(30)

simplication has been achieved by using the cyclic property for the trace in dirac
space.

after an angular average over p, the indicated integrals on p and z can be
carried out directly with the integral i1 given in [10]. the result for the four
dimensional chiral anomaly is

(31)

the notation hf i stands for hf i = 1
(4)d/2 trh0|f (x)|0i . note that, even for non lo-
cal dirac operators, the anomaly is a local polynomial of dimension d constructed
with p and the external elds y and m 1...n. this is a general property of all
anomalies since only ultraviolet divergent terms can contribute to them. the ex-
pressions found for the anomaly can be put in a more usual form, in terms of vector
and axial elds, scalar elds, etc 4, but it is preferable to use compact notation.
since the regularization preserves vector gauge invariance, the axial anomaly is also
invariant. in our expression for the anomaly, this is a direct consequence of the
operators there being multiplicative. indeed, any operator f constructed with the
gauge covariant blocks dl and m 1...n is also covariant, i.e., f  f 1. if in
addition f is multiplicative hf i is invariant. note that h i is not a trace and so the
cyclic property does not hold for arbitrary non multiplicative operators.

b trace anomaly

the corresponding trace anomaly, within the -function method is [10]

as = sw = str(ds)s=0 .

(32)

the calculation is entirely similar to that of the axial anomaly, yielding

local case.

where  =  +  + . the result is again a local polynomial of
dimension d in the external elds and their derivatives. unlike the axial case, the
coecients m  in four dimensions do contribute to the scale anomaly.

because scale and chiral transformations commute (in a properly dened sense),
the crossed variations sav,a and v,aas coincide and they vanish since the axial
anomaly is scale invariant. thus the scale anomaly must be chiral invariant. the
vector gauge invariance of the previous expressions is easy to check noting that the
operators inside h i are multiplicative. axial invariance is much more involved in
general. in four dimensions it is relatively easy to check that the trace anomaly is
axially invariant in the particular case of m  = 0, which denes a class of operators
invariant under chiral and scale transformations.

c counterterms and minimal form of the anomaly

presumably due to its topological connection [17], the axial anomaly is a very
robust quantity. it is not aected by higher order radiative corrections [18], and
remains unchanged at nite temperature and density [19]. it gets no contributions
from scalar and pseudo scalar elds [20], tensor elds [21,22,10] or internal gauge
elds, i.e, transforming homogeneously under gauge transformations
[23,24]. in
all known cases, the anomaly only aects the imaginary part of the eective action
in euclidean space and only involves vector and axial elds. the counter terms
can always be chosen so that the axial anomaly adopts the minimal or bardeens
form [20]. not surprisingly, the new terms introduced in the anomaly by the non
local component of the dirac operator are also unessential, that is, they can be
removed by adding a suitable local and polynomial counter term to the eective
action. in other words, all new terms can be derived as the axial variation of an
action which is a polynomial constructed with the external elds y and m 1...n
and their derivatives. the dimension of the polynomial can be at most d.

the general proof that the anomaly can always be brought to bardeens form
has already been presented [11]. the actual construction of the counter terms can
be done using the method in ref. [10] (see some further details in ref. [27]). one
interesting insight in the local case [10] is that the needed counterterms require
not only the dirac operator d but also its adjoint d not related to the original
theory.

the scale anomaly is already minimal. it can be modied by adding polynomial
counter terms of dimension smaller than d but this would add terms of the same
type to the scale anomaly.

iii extension to finite temperature

the wigner transformation method combined with the -function regularization
has been further extended to the nite temperature case in [28,29]. as is well
known, in the imaginary time formulation of nite temperature eld theory, the

eld congurations are periodic or antiperiodic functions of the euclidean time for
bosons and fermions respectively and thus the frequency running in the fermion loop
takes discrete values only, n = (2n+1)t (where t stands for the temperature and
n is any integer) which are known as matsubara frequencies. at nite temperature,
the trace of an operator f (x0, x; i0, i), acting on the hilbert space of d + 1-
dimensional fermions with possible internal degrees of freedom, becomes

tr(f ) = t xn z

ddp
(2)d trh0|f (x0, x; n + i0, p + i)|0i .

(34)

this formula generalizes that for zero temperature. note that f is a periodic
function of x0, and |0i is the state with zero momentum and energy normalized to
hx0, x|0i = 1, and thus it is periodic too.

in ref. [28] this method has been applied to compute the anomalous component
of the eective action of two- and four-dimensional fermions at nite temperature in
the presence of arbitrary vector and axial gauge elds and scalar and pseudoscalar
elds on the chiral circle. the computation is carried out to leading order in a
suitable commutator which preserves chiral symmetry. as is well known, at zero
temperature the gauge wess-zumino-witten (wzw) action, which saturates the
chiral anomaly, is the only leading contribution in the anomalous sector; further
terms must be lorentz and chiral invariant and they vanish identically unless they
have more gradients thereby being sub-leading terms. at nite temperature the
situation is dierent since lorentz invariance is partially broken and this allows to
have new chiral invariant contributions5 of the same order as the wzw action. in
particular these terms modify the    amplitude which is no longer determined
by the chiral anomaly [30]. the calculation in [28] conrms previous results [31,32]
that this amplitude vanishes in a chiral symmetric phase (see also [33,34]).

in ref. [29] the same technique is applied to the study of 2 + 1-dimensional
fermions at nite temperature in the presence of arbitrary background gauge elds.
the use of the -function regularization guarantees the gauge invariance of the re-
sult under topologically small and large transformations. this has allowed to solve
a long standing puzzle, namely, the apparent renormalization of the chern-simons
coecient at nite temperature, which has been shown to be a perturbation theory
artifact [35]. in ref. [29] all ultraviolet divergent terms of the eective action, within
a strict gradient expansion, have been computed. the result preserves gauge and
parity symmetries (up to the standard temperature independent parity anomaly)
and display the correct 2i multivaluation introduced by the chern-simons term.
the known exact result for massless fermions [36] is also reproduced.
