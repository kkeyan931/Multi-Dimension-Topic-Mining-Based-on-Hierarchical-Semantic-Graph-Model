abstract

the running gauge coupling and quark-antiquark potential

in d-
dimensions are calculated from the explicit solution of d + 1-dimensional
dilatonic gravity. this background interpolates between usual ads in uv
and at space with singular dilaton in ir and it realizes two-boundaries
ads/cft correspondence. the behaviour of running coupling and potential
is consistent with results following from iib supergravity.

ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] predicts some properties of quantum
gauge theory from higher-dimensional classical (super)gravity. in the more
complicated versions of ads/cft correspondence there are two boundaries:
uv and ir boundaries [4, 5].

in the recent paper [7], we presented two-boundaries ads/cft correspon-
dence in dilatonic gravity (in the presence not only of metric tensor but also
dilaton). the corresponding background [7] interpolates between standard
ads at y =  (uv) and at background with singular dilaton at y = 0 (ir).
the properties (in particular, conformal dimensions) for minimal or dilaton
coupled scalar around such background have been investigated. very similar
background has been lately found in refs.[9, 10] (see also related refs.[13]) for
iib supergravity. in these refs. the behaviour of running coupling in gauge
theory and quark-antiquark potential [11] (with possible connement due to
dilatonic eects) has been studied. in particular, the modication of these
quantities due to dilaton eects is explicitly found. note that rst exam-
ple of running gauge coupling via bulk/boundary correspondence has been
presented for type 0 strings in refs.[8, 6]. background with singular dilaton
under discussion gives another example of this beatiful phenomenon.

in the present note we calculate the running gauge coupling and quark-
antiquark potential in d-dimensions working with our background [7] realizing
two-boundaries ads/cft correspondence in dilatonic gravity. we show that
for some cases it may be similar to result of refs.
[9, 10]. some clarifying
remarks on interpretation of cfts on two boundaries as ir/uv duality are
also given.

we start with the following action in d + 1 dimensions:

s = 

1

16g z dd+1xg (r    g ) .

(1)

in the following, we assume 2   and  to be positive. in ads/cft
correspondence dilatonic gravity with above action describes n = 4 super
yang-mills theory superconformally interacting with n = 4 conformal su-
pergravity. the corresponding conformal anomaly with non-trivial dilaton
contribution has been found in ref.[12] via ads/cft correspondence.

the equations of motion can be solved and the solution is given by [7]

here ij is the metric in the at (lorentzian) background and c is a constant
of the integration. the boundary discussed in ads/cft correspondence lies
at y = .
in the string theory, the coupling on the boundary manifold, which would
be the coupling in n = 4 su(n) super-yang-mills when d = 4, is propor-
tional to an exponential of the dilaton eld . although the relation of the
present model with the string theory is not always clear (the model under dis-
cussion may be considered as low-energy string eective action), we assume
the gauge coupling has the following form (by the analogy with refs.[9, 10])

g = ge2 

d(d1) (0) .

(5)

coecient  in the exponent to be undetermined. the factor q 

since the relation with the string theory is not clear, we put the constant
d(d1) and
the shift of a constant 0 are given for convenience and they may be always
absorbed into the redenition of  and g, respectively.

the coupling g is monotonically decreasing function and vanishes at y = 0
when  > 0 ( < 0) and + () in the sign in (4) are chosen. on the
other hand, the coupling is increasing one and diverges to + at y = 0 for
 > 0 ( < 0) and  (+) sign. therefore the  sign would correspond
to strong/weak coupling duality. when y is large, which corresponds to
asymptotically anti de sitter space, g behaves as

g = g 1

if we dene a new coordinate u by

y = u 2 ,

(7)

u expresses the scale on the (boundary) d dimensional minkowski space,
which can be found from (2). following the correspondence between long-
distances/high-energy in the ads/cft scheme, u can be regarded as the
energy scale of the boundary eld theory. then from (6), we obtain the
following renormalization group equation

(u)  u

(8)

the leading behaviour is identical with that in [9] for d = 4 and the next
to leading behavior of o ((g  g)2) becomes also identical with theirs if we
choose  = 4. it maybe also noted that type 0 strings on ads background
lead to running gauge coupling as well [6, 8].

we now consider the static potential between quark and anti-quark.

we evaluate the following nambu-goto action

s =

2 z d drdet (cid:16)gs

xx(cid:17) .

with the string metric gs
function h() to the metric tensor in (2). especially we choose h() by

, which could be given by multiplying a dilaton

h() = e2

(10)

here  is an undetermined constant as  in (5). in order to treat general case,
we assume  6=  in general. we consider the static conguration x0 =  ,
x1  x = , x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0 and y = y(x). substituting the
conguration into (9), we nd

s =

t

2 z dxh ((y)) ysf (y)

y

(xy)2 + 1 .

(11)

here t is the length of the region of the denition of  . the orbit of y can be
obtained by minimizing the action s or solving the euler-lagrange equation
s

y  x(cid:16) s

(xy)(cid:17) = 0. the euler-lagrange equation tells that

(12)

e0 =

is a constant. if we assume y has a nite minimum y0, where xy|y=y0 = 0,
e0 is given by
(13)

e0 = h ((y0)) y0 .

introducing a parameter t, we parametrize y by

y = y0 cosh t .

(14)

then using (3), (10), (12) and (14), we nd

here e(l) expresses the total energy of the quark-anti-quark system.
the energy e(l) in (18), however, contains the divergence due to the self

energies of the innitely heavy quark and anti-quark. the sum of their
self energies can be estimated by considering the conguration x0 =  , x1 =
x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0 and y = y() (note that x1 vanishes here) and the
minimum of y is y0. using the parametrization of (14) and identifying t with
 (t = ), we nd the following expression of the sum of self energies:

eself = z

(22)

the behavior in (21) is essentially identical with the results in [9] but there
are some dierences. the coecient in the leading term is dierent by an
adding constant 4, which comes from the ambiguity when subtracting the self
energy3. in the second term, there would be an ambiguity coming from the
nite renormalization but by properly choosing the undetermined parameter

3since y0, the minimum of y, depends on the distance l between quark and anti-
quark as in (17), the self-energy (19) should depend on the distance l, which gives the
ambiguity in the coecient in the potential energy in (20).

 and the constant of the integration c in (3), we can reproduce the result in
(21).

let us try to understand better the background under consideration in
relation with ads/cft correspondence. we have two boundaries at y = 0
and y = . then the renormalization ow would connect two conformal
eld theories. to be specic, we only consider d = 2 case in the following.
we also choose  sign in  in (4) and 0 = 0 since 0 can be absorbed into
the redenition of g. we rescale the metric tensor by

g  g = e22g .

(23)

the redened metric behaves when y   as

ds2  gdxdx =

1

22y2

dy2 + y

d1

xi,j=0

ijdxidxj .

(24)

if we change the coordinate by y = w1, we obtain the standard metric on
anti de sitter space. on the other hand, the redened metric behaves when
y  0 as

which is the metric of anti de sitter space again. in the redenition of (23),
the action in (1) is rewritten as follows:

s = 

1

16g z dd+1xge2 (cid:16)r  e22  + 3g (cid:17) .

(26)

therefore the eective newton constant g and the eective cosmological
constant  are given by

g = e

2g,  = e22 .

(27)

in the usual ads/cft correspondence, where the dilaton is constant, the
central charge c of the conformal eld theory on the boundary is given by

c =

3l
2g

.

(28)

ds2 =

4c2

2c2y2

dy2 + y1

d1

xi,j=0

ijdxidxj


.

(25)

here the length scale l is dened by  =  d(d1)
 =  d(d1)

, we can dene the eective central charge by

l2

. similarly dening l by

l2

3l
2 g

=

3l
2g

.

c 

(29)

note that c is a constant everywhere, which would tell that the renormal-
ization ow connects conformal eld theories with same central charges.
therefore the conformal eld theories on two boundaries would correspond
to ir/uv duality (for a recent related discussion of rg ow see ref.[14]).

finally let us note that one can easily generalize the present study for
more general background containing other elds like gauge elds [10], anti-
symmetric tensor elds, etc.
