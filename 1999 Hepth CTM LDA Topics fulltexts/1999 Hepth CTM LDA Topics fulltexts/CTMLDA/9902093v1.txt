abstract

we calculate the absorption coecient of scalar eld on the background of the

two-dimensional ads black hole, which is of relevance to hawking radiation.

for the massless scalar eld, we nd that there does not exist any massless

radiation.

there has been much attention to the lower-dimensional black holes to study the -

nal state of black holes at the end of evaporation [1,2] without encountering some com-

plexities of realistic four-dimensional gravity. the evaporation of the black hole is essen-

tially based on hawking radiation [3]. the hawking radiation of callan-giddings-harvey-

strominger(cghs) model is given by the vacuum expectation value of energy-momentum

tensors, which means that the black hole is no more black, instead, grey hole after quantiza-

tion. therefore the absorption coecient [4,5] is less than one and the reection coecient

should be nontrivial.

on the other hand, two-dimensional anti-de seitter(ads2) geometry which has a constant

curvature scalar appears in the cghs model with the help of quantum back reaction of the

geometry on a constant dilaton background [6,7], where the ads2 black hole geometry is

given by

ds2 =  m +

r2

2! dt2 + m +

(1)
where the horizon is rh = m . this metric (1) is asymptotically nonat and has a constant
negative curvature scalar r =  2
drastically dierent from the asymptotic at cghs model. so one might wonder whether

conventional hawking radiation appears or not in such a ads2 black hole. the recent study

[7] shows that the ads black hole may be quantum-mechanically stable without hawking

radiation as far as we consider massless radiation from the black hole. in ref. [7], the energy-

momentum tensor for the n massless scalar elds on the ads2 black hole background yields

remarkably vanishing result as

t qt
(+, ) = t bulk

 + t boundary



= 0

(2)

where the energy-momentum tensor induced by quantum correction t qt

 is conveniently

dened by bulk and boundary contributions,

in the conformal gauge, g+ =  1
at cghs black hole, however, the hawking radiation has been determined by only the

2 e2(+ ,), g = 0,and  = n

12 . for the asymptotically

boundary contribution since the bulk part vanishes at the spatial innity. in our ads case,

the bulk contribution is denite due to the nontrivial asymptotic behavior of the geometry.

one might still wonder how does the hawking radiation of ads2 black hole vanish. so,

in this brief report, we shall study massless scalar eld as a test probe on the ads2 black

hole background and calculate absorption(or reection) coecient, which will be a dierent

test whether hawking radiation appears or not in ads2 black hole.

let us now consider the wave equation for the massless scalar eld on the ads2 black

hole background (1), which is given by

2(t, r) = 0

with (t, r) = eit(r), and it yields explicitly

(cid:16)r2  r2

h(cid:17) 2

r (r) + 2rr(r) +

24
r2  r2

h

(r) = 0.

by changing variable r in terms of z = rrh
r+rh

2(z) + (1  z)z(z) +

(0  z  1), eq.(6) becomes
z  1(cid:19) (z) = 0,

h (cid:18)1

z(1  z)z

it is exactly solved as

(r) = c1(cid:18) r  rh

r + rh(cid:19)

r + rh(cid:19)
+ c2(cid:18) r  rh

,

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

where  =  i2
which will be easily seen by rewriting eq.(8) as

2rh

. this solution (8) contains the ingoing and outgoing wave modes together,

(r) = c1e i2

2rh

ln(

rrh
r+rh

) + c2e

i2
2rh

ln(

rrh
r+rh

).

(9)

thus the coecient c1 and c2 are dened with ingoing and outgoing amplitudes, respec-

tively. the wave equation is exactly solved on the ads2 black hole background, and we

need not have matching procedure, which is contrasted to the higher-dimensional analysis

3

of greybody factors [5]. we now choose boundary condition in the near horizon region and

simply set c2 = 0, which means that the outgoing mode does not exist in the near horizon

limit [5]. on the other hand, the solution in the far region naturally contains only ingoing

mode, and modes mixing does not occur. once it means that ingoing mode starts at the

far region, it does not change its direction in the massless case. this feature is drastically

dierent from that of the wave solution of the three-dimensional ads black hole so called

banados-teitelboim-zanelli(btz) black hole [8] in that the mode mixing certainly appears

and it is responsible for the hawking radiation.

now, the ux is dened by the conserved current as

f =

and it is simply given by

2

i   r2  r2

2

h

! (r  r),

f = 4|c1|2,

(10)

(11)

by the use of eq.(9). as easily seen, the ux does not depend on the outgoing amplitude

everywhere outside the horizon, and the absorption coecient dened by

is exactly given as

a =

fnear
ffar

,

a = 1.

(12)

(13)

from eq.(13), we nd our black hole is a (perfect) black body rather than the grey hole.

the physical meaning of this result is remarkable in that there is no massless radiation in

the ads2 spacetime. this result is already shown in ref. [7] by the use of the dierent

method, direct calculation of stress-tensor on the ads2 black hole.

finally we compare our result with three-dimensional calculation of absorption coecient

of btz black hole in ref. [9]. for a limiting case of vanishing azimuthal angular momentum

of scalar eld in the nonrotating btz black hole, there is still hawking radiation, which is

4

contrast with the ads2 black hole case. this is because the radial equation in btz black

hole is dierent from eq. (6), and the reection coecient is nonzero. in three-dimensions,

in fact, ingoing mode in the near horizon is decomposed into ingoing and outgoing modes in

the far region, and this is essential reason why the hawking radiation appears. however, in

our ads2 case, the ingoing mode in the near horizon is still ingoing mode in the far region,

which reects no massless hawking radiation in ads2 black hole.
