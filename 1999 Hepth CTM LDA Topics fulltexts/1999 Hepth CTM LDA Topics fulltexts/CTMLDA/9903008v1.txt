abstract

we examine the eect of perturbative string loops on the cosmological pre-big-bang
evolution. we study loop corrections derived from heterotic string theory compacti-
ed on a zn orbifold and we consider the eect of the all-order loop corrections to
the kahler potential and of the corrections to gravitational couplings, including both
threshold corrections and corrections due to the mixed kahler-gravitational anomaly.
we nd that string loops can drive the evolution into the region of the parameter space
where a graceful exit is in principle possible, and we nd solutions that, in the string
frame, connect smoothly the superinationary pre-big-bang evolution to a phase where
the curvature and the derivative of the dilaton are decreasing. we also nd that at a
critical coupling the loop corrections to the kahler potential induce a ghost-like insta-
bility, i.e. the kinetic term of the dilaton vanishes. this is similar to what happens in
seiberg-witten theory and signals the transition to a new regime where the light modes
in the eective action are dierent and are related to the original ones by s-duality. in
a string context, this means that we enter a d-brane dominated phase.

1 introduction

pre-big-bang cosmology has been initially developed using the lowest-order eective

action of the bosonic string [1]. this allowed to understand the basic features of

this cosmological model: the universe starts at weak coupling and low curvature,

follows a superinationary evolution, and enters a large curvature phase. as long as

we are in the perturbative regime, a description with the lowest order eective action

is adequate, and can be used to discuss the cosmological evolution [1], the generality

of the initial conditions [2], and even to develop some interesting phenomenological

consequences concerning the generation of primordial gravitational, axionic, dilatonic

and electromagnetic backgrounds [3]. in particular, the low frequency part of these

spectra is only sensitive to the low curvature part of the evolution.

at lowest order, the cosmological evolution unavoidably reaches large curvatures and

strong coupling and nally runs into a singularity. at this stage it is necessary to go

beyond the lowest order eective action for understanding how string theory cures the

big-bang singularity, and for understanding the matching of pre-big-bang cosmology

with standard friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) post-big-bang cosmology (the so-

called graceful exit problem [4-12]). one can imagine two possible scenarios. the rst

is that pertubative corrections succeed in turning the regime of pre-big-bang accelerated

expansion into a decelerated expansion, and at the same time the dilaton is attracted by

the minimum of its non-perturbative potential. this should take place before entering

into a full strong coupling regime, so that perturbative results can still be trusted.

in the second scenario the evolution proceeds toward the full strongly coupled regime.

in this case one must take into account that at strong coupling and large curvature new

light states appear and then the approach based on the eective supergravity action

plus string corrections breaks down. the light modes are now dierent and one must

1

turn to a new eective action, written in terms of the new relevant degrees of freedom.

in particular, at strong coupling d-branes [13] are expected to play an important role,

since their mass scales like the inverse of the string coupling,  1/g and they are
copiously produced by gravitational elds [14] (see also refs. [15, 16, 17, 18] for related

approaches to singularities in string theory).

in this paper we investigate how far one can go within the rst scenario, analyzing a

variety of perturbative string loop corrections. the motivation comes in part from the

works [10, 11], where the authors discuss general properties that the loop corrections

should have in order to trigger a successful graceful exit.

in particular, they nd

that the corrections should have the appropriate sign, so to induce violation of the null

energy condition (nec), but there should also be a mechanism that at some stage turns

them o, otherwise the continued violation of the nec produces an unbounded growth

in the curvature and dilaton. in ref. [11] they presented a model with loop corrections

chosen ad hoc, both in the sign and in their functional form, just for the purpose of

verifying explicitly on a toy model the general results of ref. [10], and they found that

with appropriate choices a complete exit transition is indeed obtained. a transition

to a regime of decreasing curvature was also obtained, with a potential chosen ad hoc,

in the second paper of ref. [1]. this shows that string loops can in principle trigger a

complete graceful exit, but leaves open the question of whether this actually happens

for the corrections derived from at least some specic compactication of string theory.

in particular, the results of refs. [10, 11] show rst of all that the corrections should

have the appropriate sign, and this already is an interesting point to check against real

string derived corrections, and furthermore they should also have a rather non-trivial

functional form that suppresses them at strong coupling.

string loop corrections have been much studied in the literature, especially for zn

2

orbifold compactications of the heterotic string [19-34], and we can therefore ask

whether, at least in some compactication scheme, they fulll the non-trivial properties

needed for a graceful exit. in particular, corrections to the kahler potential are known

at all loops; this will be very important for our analysis, since in order to follow the

cosmological evolution into the strong coupling regime, a knowledge of the rst few

terms of the perturbative expansion is not really sucient, and one must have at least

some glimpse into the structure at all loops.

after discussing how far one can go within a perturbative approach, we will be able

to shed some light on the question of whether perturbative string theory is an adequate

tool for discussing string cosmology close to the big-bang singularity, or whether instead

non-perturbative string physics plays a crucial role, as in the scenario discussed in

ref. [14].

the paper is organized as follows. in sect. 2 we discuss the eective action of the

heterotic string with  and loop corrections for a zn orbifold compactication.

in

sect. 3 we use these corrections to study the cosmological evolution; we will introduce

various corrections one at the time, to understand better their role, and we will nd

solutions that, in the string frame, smoothly interpolate between the pre-big-bang

phase and a phase of decelerated expansion. in sect. 4 we examine the limit of validity

of the perturbative approach. we point out that loop corrections induce an instability

in the kinetic term of the dilaton, that vanishes at a critical coupling. similarly to what

happens in the seiberg-witten model, beyond this value of the coupling the eective

action is more appropriately written in terms of variables related to the original ones by

s-duality. in string theory this means that there is the onset of a new regime where the

light modes of the eective action are given by d-branes rather than by the massless

modes of fundamental strings. sect. 5 contains the conclusions.

3

2 the eective action with loop corrections

we consider the eective action of heterotic string theory compactied to four dimen-

sions on a zn orbifold, so that one supersymmetry is left in four dimensions, and we

restrict to the graviton-dilaton-moduli sector. in a generic orbifold compactication

there are the (1, 2) untwisted moduli elds ui and the diagonal (1, 1) untwisted moduli

elds ti (non-diagonal moduli are included in the matter elds). the moduli elds ui,

determine the complex structure, i.e. the shape of the compact space (they generalize

the standard modular parameter of the torus); in various zn orbifolds (see e.g. table 1

in ref. [22]) the hodge number h1,2 = 0 and therefore this shape is xed and there are

no moduli elds ui. there are instead 3 diagonal moduli elds ti. we will neglect the

elds ui and we restrict to a common diagonal modulus, ti = t ; it determines the

overall volume of compact space.

at the fundamental level string theory compactied on orbifolds is invariant under

t -duality, which includes sl(2, z) transformations of the common modulus t

t 

at  ib
ict + d

,

(1)

with a, b, c, d  z and ad  bc = 1. these modular transformations are good quantum
symmetries, and therefore they must be exact symmetries also at the level of the loop-

corrected low-energy eective action. while at tree level the dilaton is inert under

modular transformations, at one-loop the cancellation of the modular anomaly requires

that the dilaton transforms as [19]

s  s + 2 log(ict + d) ,

(2)

where re s = e and  is the dilaton eld;  is a positive constant of order one which

depends on the coecient of the anomaly, see below. then one easily veries that

4

s + s + 2 log(t + t ) is modular invariant. we can therefore introduce a one-loop

corrected modular invariant coupling g2

0 from [19, 20]

1
g2
0

=

1
2

(s + s) +  log(t + t ) = e +  ,

(3)

where we have dened the eld  from ret = (1/2)e (the factor 1/2 is not conven-

tional but we found it convenient). loop corrections to the eective action can be

computed directly as an expansion in terms of the modular invariant coupling g2

0 [20].

as we see from eq. (3),

g2
0 =

e

1 + e ,

(4)

and therefore an expansion in g2

0 provides a resummation and a reorganization of the

expansion in e. note in particular that even when e is large, the expansion in g2

0 is
if  log v  1, where v is the volume of compact

still under control if   1, i.e.
space in string units.

we include in the action terms with two derivatives and terms with four derivatives,

i.e. o() corrections to the leading term. for both the two- and four-derivatives

terms we include modular invariant loop corrections. we discuss separately the two-

and four-derivatives terms in subsections 2.1 and 2.2.

2.1 terms with two derivatives

in the einstein frame, where the gravitational term has the canonical einstein-hilbert

form, the action for the metric-dilaton-modulus system compactied to four dimensions

is

1

 z d4xg(cid:20) 1

2

se
0 =
i = d2k/dzidzj and k is the kahler potential. we use the

r  k j

i zi zj(cid:21) .

(5)

here zi = (s, t ), k j
conventions  = (, +, +, +), r

 = 

 + . . . and r = r

. the superscript

5

e reminds that this action is written in the einstein frame. the einstein-hilbert

term gr is not renormalized at one-loop [26] and this non-renormalization theorem

persists to all orders in perturbation theory around any heterotic string ground state

with at least n = 1 space-time supersymmetry [34]. at tree level the kahler potential
is ktree =  log(s + s)3 log(t + t ). it does renormalize, and at one loop, for heterotic
string compactied on a zn orbifold, becomes [19]

k1loop =  log(cid:16)s + s + 2 log(t + t )(cid:17)  3 log(t + t ) ,

(6)

where  = 3gs/(82). for instance for z3 orbifolds gs = c(e8)/2 = 15, where c(e8)

is the quadratic casimir of e8, and therefore   0.57. eq. (6) holds at one-loop, i.e. at
rst order in an expansion in 1/(s + s). however, the all-orders resummation implicit

in eq. (6) is dictated by the fact that under the modular transformations given by

eqs. (1,2) the combination s + s + 2 log(t + t ) is invariant, and therefore respects the

t -duality symmetry of the underlying string theory. in terms of the modular invariant

coupling g2

0 dened in eq. (3) we can write eq. (6) as

k1loop = log g2

2 !  3 log(t + t ) .

0

(7)

eq. (7) is the leading term of an expansion in g2

0 of the all-order kahler potential.

indeed, the kahler potential has been computed at all perturbative orders in ref. [20],

under the assumption that no dilaton dependent corrections other than the anomaly

term are generated in perturbation theory. one denes implicitly the all-loop corrected

coupling g2 from

1
g2 =

1
g2
0

+

2
3

log(

1
g2 ) + const. .

the all-loop corrected kahler potential then reads [20]

k = log"g2

2 (cid:18)1 +


3

g2(cid:19)3#  3 log(t + t ) ,

6

(8)

(9)

and at g2

0  1 it reduces to eq. (7) plus terms o(g2

0 log g2

0).

the coupling g2 is just the eective gauge coupling that multiplies the term f 2

 after

taking into account loop corrections [20] and, as we will see in the next section, it also

multiplies the four derivative term. so the dilaton enters the action only through g2.

we therefore dene a new eld  from

g2 = e

(10)

and we will treat it as our fundamental dilaton eld. therefore our loop-corrected

two-derivative action is given by eq. (5) where now zi = (s , t ), re s  = e = g2

and k is given by eq. (9).

in the following, it will be convenient to work in the string frame. in four dimensions,

we dene the string frame metric gs

 in terms of the metric in the einstein frame ge


from ge

 = gs

e (in four dimensions the dilaton is the same in the two frames). note

that we use  rather than  to transform between the two frames. at lowest order in

e of course this reduces to the standard denition, but beyond one-loop the denition

in terms of  is more convenient.

writing explicitly the kinetic terms of the dilaton and modulus eld, (and omitting

the superscript s for string frame quantities) the loop-corrected two-derivative action

in the string frame reads

s0 =

1

2 z d4xge(cid:20)r + (1 + eg())  

3
2

(cid:21) ,

where we have dened

g() = (cid:18) 3

2 (cid:19) 6 + e
(3 + e)2 .

2.2 terms with four derivatives

(11)

(12)

7

2.2.1 the four-derivatives term at tree level

for the four derivative term we nd convenient to work directly in the string frame.

at tree-level it can be written as [35, 36]

(s1)tree =

1

2 z d4xg   k

4 ! s + s

2

hrr + brr + cr2i

(13)

and, for the heterotic string, k = 1/2 (still, we display k explicitly in our equations to

make easier the comparison with ref. [8]; note however that we use the opposite metric

signature compared to ref. [8]). the eective action can be obtained requiring that it

reproduces the string amplitudes. this procedure xes the coecient of rr;

however, the coecients b, c cannot be determined from the comparison with (on-shell)

string amplitudes; this can be understood, for instance, showing that the coecients

b, c do not enter in the computation of amplitudes with three on-shell gravitons, while

in the computations of four-graviton amplitudes they cancel between the contact and

exchange graphs [31].

a related source of ambiguity appears when one truncates the perturbative expansion

in  at any nite order. in fact, suppose that we choose somehow a value for b, c (two

natural possibilities are either b = c = 0 or b = 4, c = 1, which forms the gauss-
bonnet combination). still, we can always perform a eld redenition that mixes

dierent orders in , e.g. g  g +(a1r +a2+. . .), and   +b1r+
. . .. this would not change the physics if one would be able to include all orders in the

 expansion, but it does make a dierence if we truncate at a nite order in . for

instance, retaining only two- and four-derivative terms this redenition, applied to

the two-derivative terms, generates new four derivative term, while the four-derivatives

terms generates six-derivative terms which are truncated if we work at order . the

terms which are generated at the four derivative level by a generic eld redenitions are

just the terms rr, r2, plus other operators of the same order involving the dilaton,

8

like ()4, r, etc. this is another way to understand why the coecients of

these terms cannot be xed by the computation of string amplitudes. the term r2



is instead unaected by eld redenitions, consistently with the fact that its coecient

is xed by the comparison with string amplitudes. the study of the cosmological

evolution using any specic action truncated at order  should then be considered as

only indicative of the possible cosmological behaviours. with suitable choices, one nds

that the lowest-order pre-big-bang solutions are indeed regularized by the inclusion of

 corrections, and instead of running into the singularity, they are now matched (in

the string frame) to a phase of de sitter expansion with linearly growing dilaton [8].

the eect on the cosmological evolution of these ambiguities have been studied in

refs. [8, 9, 12]. here will take the point of view that, independently of these ambiguities,

a solution that, thanks to suitably chosen  corrections, approaches asymptotically a

de sitter phase with linear dilaton is a simple way to model a regularizing eect, which

can have a dierent and deeper physical motivation: for instance, in ref. [37] we found

that a similar transition to a de sitter phase with linearly growing dilaton is driven

by the formation of a gravitino-dilatino condensate. this mechanism is independent of

the ambiguities discussed, and only depends on the dynamical assumption that such a

condensate forms.

our choice for the form of the tree-level-four derivative term is the same used in

refs. [8, 11]:

(s1)tree =

1

2   k

4 !z d4xg ehr2

gb  ()4i .

(14)

in ref. [8] this form was obtained setting b = c = 0 in eq. (13) and then performing a

eld redenition that generates r2

 and r2 with the right coecients to produce the

gauss-bonnet combination r2

gb = r2

  4r2

 + r2, and this also generates the term

()4.

9

actually, our two-derivative action diers from that used in [8] already at tree level,

because we have included the eld . the eld redenition that generates the gauss-

bonnet term will also generate a number of four-derivative terms which depends also

on . we will neglect these terms because, on the one hand they make the action

much more complicated, and on the other hand they are basically irrelevant to the

dynamics, as will be clear from the results of sect. 3 and as we have checked on some

examples. actually, because of the ambiguities intrinsic in a truncation at nite order

in , it is not very meaningful to insist on any specic form of the action, and it is more

important to look for properties shared at least by a large class of actions compatible

with string theory.

2.2.2 the loop-corrected four-derivatives term

let us rst recall what happens in the slightly simpler case of a gauge coupling ga,

where the index a refers to the gauge group under consideration. the coupling 1/g2

a is

identied as the coecient of (1/4)f a
f a. at tree level, this term only appears when
we expand in components the supereld expression (1/2)fa(s)w aw a, where w a is
the chiral supereld containing f a
; fa(s)tree = s is independent of the gauge group,

and 1/g2

a = res. at one-loop fa(s) gets a moduli-dependent renormalization [19-34]

fa(s)1loop = s + a(t, t ) ,

(15)

for orbifolds with no n = 2 subsector, such as z3 and z7, a(t, t ) = a is a moduli-

independent constant, and there is no moduli-dependent one-loop correction. beyond

one-loop, fa(s) is protected by a non-renormalization theorem [39].

furthermore, at one loop a contribution to ff  comes from the anomaly:

in

fact, since the fermions in the supergravity-matter action are chiral, the tree level

eective action leads, through triangle graphs, to one-loop anomalies. the type of

10

anomaly depends on the connections attached to the vertices. in particular, because

of kahler symmetry, chiral fermions are coupled to a uk(1) kahler connection, which

is a non-propagating composite eld. modular transformations are a subset of kahler

transformations and therefore, if the theory is kahler invariant, it is also invariant

under modular transformations. considering a triangle graph with one kahler con-

nection and two gauge bosons attached at the vertices, we get a mixed kahler-gauge

anomaly, proportional to f a


f a. the anomaly can be represented in the eective

theory with a non-local term whose (local) variation reproduces the anomaly. because

of supersymmetry, this eective non-local term, when expanded in component elds,

together with f a


f a also contains a term proportional to f a

f a which, restricting

to a common modulus, reads [19]

(cid:18)

3(cid:19)" k(t, t )  221 2 k

t  t

t  t# 1

4

f a .
f a

(16)

with k(t, t ) = 3 log(t + t ).1 in the limit of constant t this term becomes local,
and gives an additional moduli-dependent one-loop contribution to the gauge coupling

g2
a. therefore, specializing for the moment to a z3 or z7 orbifold,

1
g2
a

=

s + s

2

+  log(t + t ) + a .

(17)

the variation of the term  log(t + t ) under modular transformation is just the

anomaly, and the requirement of anomaly cancellation imposes the transformation

law, eq. (2), on the dilaton eld. note that in the case of z3 and z7 orbifolds the

moduli-dependent part of a vanishes, and therefore it cannot contribute to the can-

cellation of the anomaly; the cancellation comes entirely from the variation of s; so, in

this case the anomaly must be independent of the gauge group, as indeed checked in
1a direct derivation of the term  f f  from feynman graphs is quite subtle since, in the
formulation of supergravity with the canonically normalized einstein term, bosonic currents do not
couple to the kahler connection and therefore bosons cannot run into the triangle graph; this apparent
puzzle is discussed in ref. [29].

11

ref. [19]. using the linear multiplet formalism [40], one realizes that this cancellation

mechanism is just a four-dimensional version of the green-schwarz mechanism.

at all loops, g2

a in eq. (17) is replaced by denition with the all-loop corrected eective

coupling, which is the quantity that appears in the all-loop corrected kahler potential,

eq. (9) [20].

let us now discuss four-derivative gravitational couplings, which are the ones relevant

for our analisys.

in this case we have three couplings, multiplying r2

, r2

, r2.

the one-loop renormalization of these coupling has been studied in refs. [26-31]. the

situation is similar to the case of gauge couplings, and the contributions again come

from the threshold corrections and from the anomaly (in this case, a mixed kahler

-gravitational anomaly, i.e. a triangle graph with one kahler connection and two spin

connections attached to the vertices). there are however some complications: rst

the weyl tensor, i.e. to r2

of all, only one combination of these operators, corresponding to the the square of
  2rr + (1/3)r2, is obtained from a holomorc
function [30], and the other two independent combinations are not protected by a non-

renormalization theorem. since, in terms of superelds, the other two combinations

that can be formed depend only on r2

 and r2, this means that r2

 or r2

gb are

protected, while naked r2

, r2 terms are not. furthermore, the ambiguity due to eld

redenitions and truncation at order  that we have discussed at tree level, persists

of course at one and higher loops, so that terms like ()4, r, etc., as well

as term that depend on g(), can be generated with eld redenitions.

it is then

clear that the most general action is very complicated. we have chosen to focus on

the loop correction to the same operator that we have considered at tree level, i.e. to

the combination r2

gb  ()4, neglecting naked r2

, r2, ()4 terms, as well as other

terms that can be generated by eld redenitions. it is of course possible to extend

12

our analysis including other operators, but we believe that our choice is sucient to

illustrate the general role of loop corrections, while at the same time the action retains

a suciently simple form, and in particular the equations of motion remain of second

order. our four-derivative action is therefore s1 + snl, where
4 !z d4xg (cid:16)e + ()(cid:17)hr2

2   k

s1 =

and snl is the non-local contribution from the anomaly,

t  t

(18)

(19)

in the following we will neglect the non-local term. however, an eect of the anomaly

is still present, because it has also produced the local contribution necessary to turn

e into the modular-invariant combination e. threshold corrections produce the

function ,

(t, t ) = 

bgr
42 logh(t + t )|(it )|4i + gr .

(20)

the constant gr depends on the orbifold considered, and typical values are estimated

in ref. [32]. the constant bgr is related to the number of chiral, vector, and spin- 3
2

massless super-multiplets, ns, nv , n3/2 respectively, by [38]

bgr =

(3nv + ns)

(21)

and vanishes for orbifolds with no n = 2 subsector as z3 and z7; (it ) is the dedeknid

eta function,



( ) = q1/12

yn=1(cid:16)1  q2n(cid:17) ,

q  ei .

(22)

the anomaly produces also a term  r r. however, below we will specialize
to a metric of the frw form, and in this background r r vanishes identically

(which allows us to look for solutions of the equations of motion with im s = 0,

im t = 0 [38]).

13

3 the cosmological evolution

we now restrict to an isotropic frw metric with scale factor a(t) = e(t), and hubble

parameter h = a/a = . we use h to denote the hubble parameter in the string

frame. another useful quantity is the hubble parameter in the einstein frame, he,

related to h and  by

he = e/2(cid:18)h 

1
2

(cid:19) .

(23)

(recall that we use  rather than  to move from the einstein to the string frame).
the shifted dilaton  is dened by     3h. in the numerical analysis we will use
units k = 1.

at lowest order in both the  and the loop expansion the solutions of the eective

action come in pairs. for  = 0, they satisfy  = (3  3)h, or  = 3h, referred
to as () branches respectively [1]. the (+) branch, when h > 0, describes a universe
that starts from the low curvature regime and follows an accelerated superinationary

expansion. this is called a pre-big-bang type solution, and is characterized by  >

0. the () branch, when h > 0, describes instead a post-big-bang evolution with
decelerated expansion and  < 0.
in the present era we have a frw decelerated

expansion with stabilized dilaton,

 = 0, h > 0, and therefore  < 0. a graceful

exit is then obtained if the cosmological evolution connects the (+) branch with a

() branch solution. necessary conditions for this to happen have been discussed
by brustein and madden [10], and it turns out that a rather non trivial interplay of

dierent types of corrections is required. first of all, of course, we must move from

the region of parameter space where  > 0 to the region with  < 0. this can be

accomplished with  corrections [8]. furthermore, it can be shown that on the (+)

branch he < 0 (in fact, without corrections, he is monotonically decreasing and runs

toward  at the singularity) and it is still negative at the branch change, i.e., when

14

 = 0. to conclude the exit successfully, it is shown in ref. [10] that the evolution

must proceed to a region where he is positive. this is in general non-trivial since at

the beginning of the evolution he is negative and decreasing, and therefore a bounce

in he is necessary. thus, some new physical eect must be turn on to produce this

bounce, and it is at this point that loop corrections are supposed to be crucial. it was

found in ref. [11] that indeed a one-loop correction with the appropriate sign turns

the decrease of he into a growth and drives the solution into the region he > 0.

however, this growth is unbounded, and the solution is now driven toward he  +.
therefore it is necessary that, after we have reached the region he > 0, some new

mechanism turns on and kills the eect of the one-loop corrections. this was modelled

in ref. [11] multiplying the loop correction by a smoothed theta function. then, after

the evolution reaches the region he > 0 and loops corrections are switched o, it

becomes in principle possible to stabilize the dilaton with a potential.

in this section we study the equations of motion, taking initial conditions of the

pre-big-bang type; we will add various sources of corrections one at the time, in order

to have some understanding of the role of the various terms, and we will compare with

the above picture.

3.1 the evolution without loop corrections

first of all, we examine the behaviour of the system including  corrections, but

without the inclusion of loop corrections. in this case  =  and our action reads

the solution has at rst the usual pre-big-bang superinationary evolution and then,

when the curvature becomes of order one (in units k = 1), it feels the eect of the 

corrections. at this stage, instead of running into the singularity, it is attracted towards

a xed point with h and  constants. this picture is not modied by the inclusion of

. in fact, writing also the equation of motion for , one immediately sees that there

is an algebraic solution of the equations of motion with  = 0, and h,  constant and

the same as in ref. [8], i.e. h = 0.616 . . . ,  = 1.40 . . .. the numerical integration, see

figs. 1a,1b, shows that this solution is still an attractor of the pre-big-bang solution.

for the discussion of the graceful exit, it is very convenient to display the solutions

also in the (h, ) plane, following ref. [11]. in this graph, shown in fig. 2, four lines are

of special interest. in order of increasing slope, the rst line is the (+) branch of the

lowest order solution (more precisely, this line corresponds to the lowest order solution

only in the limit  = 0, and the deviation of the initial evolution from it that we see

in fig. 2 is due to a non-vanishing initial value of ). the second line corresponds to

branch change, i.e.

  3h = 0. the third is the line where he = 0, and as found
in [10], it is necessary that the evolution crosses also this line to complete the exit.

finally, we have the line representing a () branch solution. we see from fig. 2 that
the lowest order solution ends up at a xed point, after crossing the branch change

line, but it is still in the region he < 0.

the solution shown in this subsection can be considered as the starting point of

our analysis; in the following subsections we will see how the various loop corrections

modify this basic picture.

3.2 the eect of the loop-corrected kahler potential

to begin our analysis we restrict to a z3 orbifold, so that threshold corrections vanish,

and we also neglect the non-local term. the action that we use in this section is

17

(26)

we again restrict to isotropic frw metric and homogeneous elds and write the equa-

tions of motion for the elds (t), (t), (t). taking the variation with respect to ,

we get the equation of motion

d

dt (cid:16)e3 (cid:17) = 0 .

(27)

therefore, if we take as initial condition  = 0,  will stay constant. in this case the

non-local term, eq. (19), vanishes at all times, and therefore, for this initial condition,

no approximation is made omitting it.

before starting with the full numerical integration it is useful to make contact with

the general analisys of ref. [11]. we therefore restrict to constant  (since  was not

included in ref. [11]) and we write the equation of motion obtained with a variation of

the lapse function in the form

where

6h 2 + 2  6h  = e( + q)

 = (k)e(cid:18)6h 3

(29)

is the contribution of the  corrections. the contribution of loop corrections is in the

function q which, from our action, turns out to be

q =  2g() =  2(cid:18)3

2 (cid:19) 6 + e
(3 + e)2 .

(30)

18

in ref. [10] it was found that a graceful exit could be obtained with a loop correction
that gives q = 3f () 4, with f () a smoothed theta function going to zero, for large
, as e16. this form of the correction was just postulated in ref. [11], but comparing

it with the string result, eq. (30), we nd that, rst of all, the sign comes out right,
which is of course non-trivial. the dependence is  2 rather than 4 since it comes
from a correction to the kinetic term and, most importantly, its behaviour at large 

is dierent. in fact g() resembles a smoothed theta function, which is also a non-

trivial and encouraging result, but it goes to zero only as e, which just compensate

the factor e in eq. (28). we will see from the numerical analysis that this produces

important dierences compared to ref. [11].

we now turn to the full numerical analysis, we restore  as a dynamical eld and

we set k = 1. the equations of motion obtained with a variation with respect to 

and  are, respectively,

6 h(1 + h 2) + (2 + 2eg + 3 2)  12h 2 
+6(1 + eg)h   2(1  eg) = 0 ,

and together with eq. (27) they determine the evolution of the system. the variation

with respect to the lapse function produces a constraint of the initial data,

with  and q given in eqs. (29,30). the constraint is conserved by the dynamical

equations of motion. we used this conservation as a check of the accuracy of the

integration routine. typically, the constraint is zero with an accuracy of 105.

the result of the numerical integration is shown in figs. 3a,3b. we see that at

, h including the all-order loop corrections to the
initial conditions are the same as in the

.

rst loop corrections are small and , h are the same as in fig. 1a. at some stage

loop corrections become important and the solution settles to a new xed point, again

with  and h constant.

instead, at least on the scale used, the evolution of

 is

indistinguishable from the case without loop corrections, compare figs. 3b and 1b,

because  is practically zero when loop corrections become eective. the change of

regime takes place when the coupling g2 is of order one, as can be seen from fig. 4,

where we expand the region in time where loop corrections become important and we

plot h,  and the coupling g2.

from these plots, it might seem that after all the situation is not so dierent from the

tree level evolution, because in both cases the solution in the string frame eventually

approaches a de sitter phase with linearly growing dilaton. an important dierence

however is found plotting the solution in the (h, ) plane, see fig. 5. we see in fact

that the solution has crossed the line he = 0 (and actually even the () branch line)
and therefore entered the region of parameter space where a graceful exit is in principle

possible. plotting the evolution of he shows again that the loop corrections due to

the kahler potential produce a bounce in he, see fig. 6.

thus, loop corrections to the kahler potential succeed in doing part of what loop

corrections are expected to do, i.e. they produce a bounce in he and move the solution

into the region he > 0. however, we also want to obtain a solution with h,  eventually

decreasing and we want to connect this solution to the () branch. we therefore turn
to threshold correction to see if they can produce this eect.

3.3 the eect of threshold corrections

as initial conditions for  we take a value close to the self-dual point, (0)  sd = log 2,
that is re t  1, and we take  small (consistently with the fact that the pre-big-
bang evolution starts from the at perturbative vacuum). we will discuss later the

dependence on the initial conditions. with these choices, for a generic orbifold ()

turns out to be practically constant during the course of the evolution (and for a z3
or z7 orbifold () = gr is exactly constant) and its value is determined by bgr and

gr; taking for instance gr = 0, we have found nonsingular solutions in the range
bgr  [20, 0), which corresponds to (sd)  [0.18, 0).

the evolution of the system under these conditions is shown in figs. 7a,7b. the

behaviour of h,  is quite remarkable: threshold corrections turn the de sitter phase

with linearly growing dilaton into a phase with h,  decreasing! at the same time

the modulus , and therefore the volume of internal space, shows a rather elaborate

dynamics, see fig. 7b. these gures refer to a z6 orbifold, for which   0.19. the
same qualitative behaviour is obtained for a z3 orbifold, in which case () = gr is

exactly constant, and the same results are also obtained for dierent, generic, values

of .

the evolution in the (h, ) plane is shown in fig. 8, and we see that the solution

approaches the () branch. from this gure we also see that the solution approaches

at rst the tree-level xed point discussed in sect. 3.1, then corrections to the kahler

potential and the threshold corrections become important about at the same time, so

that after leaving this xed point the solution deviates immediately from the behaviour

that it has in the absence of thresholds corrections, shown in g. 5, and it does not get

close to the xed point marked by a cross in g. 5. instead, if we do not include the

corrections to the kahler potential and we only switch on the threshold corrections,

we found that the solution never crosses the bounce line he = 0, and therefore the

corrections to the kahler potential are really an essential ingredient of our solution.

fig. 9 shows instead the evolution of the coupling g2, and we see that the curvature
and the derivative of the dilaton start decreasing when g2  1, so that when the solution
is close to the () branch we are already at large g, and at this stage non-perturbative
eects are expected to become important. we will discuss this point further in sect. 4.

some specic choices of action and of initial conditions, it is certainly interesting to

have at least an example of such a behaviour, with choices well motivated by string

theory. to get some understanding of the dependence on the initial conditions we have

run the integration routine for many dierent values of (0) and (0). the shaded area

in fig. 10 is the region of the plane ((0),

(0)) where the behaviour is qualitatively

the same as that shown above, while for initial conditions outside the shaded region

the evolution in general runs into a singularity. considering that  is at the exponent

in re t , the limitation on (0) is not particularly strong, while the required values of

(0) are of the same order as the initial value of h. these initial conditions do not

imply therefore any ne tuning.

to have a better understanding of these solutions, it is also useful to display the

corresponding einstein-frame quantities. (we still plot them against string frame time

t, but the same qualitative behaviour is obtained against einstein frame time te; the

two are related by dt = dte exp(/2)). in figs. 11a,11b we plot e = d/dte and he.

the latter is particularly interesting and shows that in the einstein frame our solution

approaches asymptotically a de sitter ination. this is of course very dierent from

the result of ref. [8] or of sect. 3.1, where de sitter ination takes place in the string

frame.

4 transition to a d-brane dominated regime

we now discuss the limitations on the validity of our solutions. as it is clear from
fig. 9, at large values of time we are deep into the strong coupling regime, g2  1.
can we still believe our solutions? in our action we have included the corrections to the

kahler potential at all perturbative orders, while other operators, like r and r2

 are

protected by non renormalization theorems. therefore, despite the ambiguities that

we have discussed for the four-derivative terms, due in particular to naked r2

 and r2

terms, one might be tempted to argue that the solution is at least representative of the

behaviour at strong coupling. however, this point of view is untenable, and at some

point the perturbative approach itself breaks down.

to understand this point, it is useful to work in the einstein frame. the two-

derivative part of our action then reads

.

(41)

at e > g2

c it appears that the dilaton becomes ghost-like. the situation is quite similar

to what happens in seiberg-witten theory [41], and the physical interpretation is the

same. we can rescale the dilaton so that it has a canonically normalized kinetic term
(1/2), and in terms of the rescaled dilaton the four-derivative interactions,
and in general all interactions involving the dilaton, become strong as we approach

29

gc, and formally diverge at the critical point. this signals that the eective action

approach that we have used breaks down and we must move to a new description,

where the light degrees of freedom are dierent. in the seiberg-witten model the new

weakly coupled modes are related to the original ones by an s-duality transformation.

in string theory the s-dual variables are given by d-branes: for instance, in the einstein

frame, a fundamental string has a tension g1/2/(2) while a d-string has a tension

g1/2/(2) [13]. this suggest that, if the cosmological evolution enters the regime

e > g2

c , the eective action approach that we have used breaks down, and we enter

a new regime, which cannot be described in terms of a classical evolution of massless

modes of a closed string; in this regime we must resort to a description in terms of

d-branes.

more precisely, the condition z = 0 identies the critical point only if , h can be

neglected. in fact, the equation of motion for  in the einstein frame reads (we insert

for future use also a potential v ())

the dots denote tree-level  corrections (which are neglegible at the later stage of the

evolution). we recall that we found regular solutions for  < 0. so we see that, if we

or

e, the critical line is given by the condition m = 0

z + 3|| 2

e = 0 ,

(45)

rather than z = 0. of course when e approaches one we should at least include

all higher powers in the  expansion. more importantly, in the regime where h or 

approach one other restrictions on the validity of the eective action appear, and have

been discussed in ref. [14], embedding the 10-dimensional theory into 11-dimensional

m-theory compactied on s1. in fig. 12 (adapted from ref. [14]) on the vertical axis

we show h, in the string frame. this is an indicator of the curvature and therefore

of the typical energy scale of the solution. one might as well use , but of course

precise numerical values here are not very important. in this graph we prefer to use

the string frame quantity h because in this case the  corrections become important
when h  1, while in terms of he this condition becomes eh 2

e  1.

the solid line h  1/g separates the region where an eective 10-dimensional de-
scription is possible, from the truly 11-dimensional regime. the region just above the

line labelled 11d-sugra is described by 11-dimensional supergravity, while above the

line labelled dp-branes we are in the full m-theory regime. for a discussion of the

crossover between these regimes we refer the reader to ref. [14]. of course, again, the

position of the line separating the full m-theory regime from the 11-d supergravity

regime is only indicative, and we have arbitrarily chosen its position so that it meets

the curve h = 1/g exactly at h = g = 1.

on the 10-dimensional side we have also drawn as a solid line the curve given by

eq. (45), which is another critical line where a change of regime occurs. when e is

not small, the form of this curve is only indicative. the position of gc depends on ,

eq. (41), and the graph refers to a z6 orbifold,   0.19. after the curve enters in the
11-dimensional region it is not anymore meaningful. the label s-duality means that,

crossing this line, we enter a regime where the light degrees of freedom are related to

the original ones by s-duality. on the same gure we display the solution of fig. 7a,

labelled by the arrows. the solution for h will eventually decrease, but this only

happens at very large values of g2 (see fig. 9), and we see that the solution enters the

11-dimensional domain before it starts decreasing. at this point, it looses its validity.

finally, we found that it is not possible to stabilize the dilaton in our solution at

a minimum of a potential, as could be generated for instance by gaugino condensa-

tion [43]. in fact at the later stage of the evolution the tree level  corrections are
neglegible, as we see in fig. 7a, and m  12eg()+3|| 2

e. if we would stabilize 

at the inversion points e = 0, so that here the coecient of e in eq. (42) becomes

 z. as shown in fig. 13, this quantity is negative after we cross the he > 0 line.
as we discussed, this is not a problem for the consistency of the solution as long as

is not small (in fact, fig. 12 shows that the limitation on the validity of the solution

is rather given by the crossing into the 11-dimensional region), but it is clear that no

consistent solution with e = 0 can be obtained trying to stabilize the dilaton with a

potential. in fact, if we try to force e to a small value, the coecient of e in eq. (42)

becomes approximately equal to z, which at this stage is negative. therefore the evo-

lution runs away from the minimum of the potential. numerically, we have found that,

including a potential in the numerical integration of the equations of motion, when the

solution approaches the minimum of the potential the numerical precision, monitored

by the constraint equation, degrades immediately and the solution explodes.

therefore, in our scenario, the problem of the dilaton stabilization can only be solved

after the solution enters in the non-perturbative regime.

33

5 conclusions

in this paper we have tried to penetrate into the strong coupling regime of the cosmo-

logical evolution derived from string theory. this regime is crucial for an understanding

of the big-bang singularity in string theory, but since loop corrections do not tame the

growth of the coupling while remaining within the weak coupling domain, it is clear

that a knowledge limited to, say, one-loop corrections is of little use, and we really

need to have at least a glimpse into the structure of the corrections at all perturbative

orders. luckily, for the eective action of orbifold compactications of heterotic string

theory, supersymmetry and modular invariance impose strong constraints on the form

of the corrections at all orders. in particular, the kinetic terms of the dilaton is known

exactly, while other operators, like r and r2

, are protected by non-renormalization

theorems. therefore, in spite of some ambiguities in the choice of the four-derivative

terms, present both at tree level and for their loop corrections, one can try to investi-

gate string cosmology beyond the weak coupling domain, and to obtain at least some

indications of what a well motivated stringy scenario looks like.

as a rst step, we have therefore tried to push this perturbative approach as far as

possible, following the evolution even in the strong coupling domain g  1. we have
found solutions with interesting properties, that in the string frame start with a pre-big-

bang superinationary phase, go through a phase with h,  approximately constant

and of order one in string units, (a phase that replaces the big-bang singularity) and

then match to a regime with h,  decreasing. apart from their intrinsic interest, these

solutions provide an illustration of the interplay between  and loop corrections in

string cosmology, and give an explicit realization of the general picture emerged from

the works [1,5-12]. probably the main element that is missing from this part of the

analysis is the inclusion of non-local terms. these might model the backreaction due

34

to quantum particles production, which might play an important role in the graceful

exit transition [42]. unfortunately, these are quite dicult to include in a numerical

analysis.

despite some nice properties, the cosmological model that we have presented still

have some unsatisfactory features, and in particular the dilaton could not be stabilized

with a potential, and so this model cannot be the end of the story.

on the other hand we have found that, if we look at our solution from the broader

perspective of 11-dimensional theory, it ceases to be valid as soon as we enter into

the strong coupling region, even if one includes perturbative corrections at all orders.

thus, we think that our analysis reveals quite clearly the direction that should be

taken to make further progress. as already discussed in ref. [14], when we move to-

ward large curvatures we meet critical lines in the (h, g) plane, beyond which d-branes

becomes the relevant degrees of freedom. here we have found another critical line at

strong coupling; beyond this line the light modes relevant for an eective action ap-

proach are obtained by an s-duality transformation and are therefore again naturally

interpreted as d-branes. the combination of these critical lines, shown in g. 12, and

the behaviour of our solutions, also displayed on the same graph, suggest that the

evolution enters unavoidably the regime where new descriptions set in. the under-

standing and the smoothing of the big-bang singularity therefore requires the use of

truly non-perturbative string physics.
