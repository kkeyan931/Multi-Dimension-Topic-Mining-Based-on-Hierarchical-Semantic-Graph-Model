1. introduction

three dimensional gauge theories have attracted interest since long time due to the pos-

sibility of a gauge invariant mass term for the gauge elds [1]. three dimensional eld

theoretical models are believed to provide eective theories for long distance planar con-

densed matter models [2] and high temperature four dimensional gauge eld theories [3].

in particular quantum electrodynamics in (2 + 1)-dimensions has been intensively studied

within the eective theories of high-tc superconductivity [4].

as a matter of fact, it turns out that in qed2+1 with massive dirac fermions the pertur-

bative ground state is unstable towards the spontaneous generation of an uniform magnetic

condensate [5,6]. moreover, it turns out that this remarkable property is not shared with

other (2 + 1)-dimensional eld theories [7].

it is well known that four dimensional dirac fermions with yukawa coupling to a scalar

eld develop zero mode solutions near a domain wall [8].

indeed, let us consider a four

dimensional massless dirac fermion coupled to a scalar eld through the yukawa coupling :

where

l = l + l ,

l = (x)i 6  (x)  gy (x)(x)(x) ,

l =

(1)

(2)

(3)

the scalar eld develops a non vanishing vacuum expectation value hi = v . in general
it is easy to see
one may assume that there are regions with hi = +v and hi = v.
that the classical equation of motion of the scalar eld admits the solution describing the

transition layer between two adjacent regions with dierent values of hi:

where

(z) = v tanh(cid:18) z

the solution eq. (4) is known as kink. in presence of the kink the dirac equation

[i 6   gy (x)](x) = 0

(5)

(6)

admits zero energy solutions localized on the wall [8]. using the following representation of

the dirac algebra:

(10)

(11)

it is easy to see that (x, y) satises the (2 + 1)-dimensional massless dirac equation with

the dirac algebra eq. (8).

thus we see that two-component dirac fermions in (2 + 1) dimensions are relevant for the

dynamics of zero modes localized at the domain walls. indeed, recently [9] it has been sug-

gested that the remarkable phenomenon of the spontaneous generation of uniform magnetic

condensate in (2 + 1)-dimensional qed gives rise to ferromagnetic domain walls at the cos-

mological electroweak phase transition which could account for the cosmological primordial

3

magnetic eld.

the aim of this paper is to study in details the (2+1)-dimensional qed with two-component

(parity-violating) and four-component (parity-invariant) fermions both at zero and nite

temperature. the plan of the paper is as follows. in sect. 2 we consider dirac fermions

with p-odd mass term (two component fermions) at zero and nite temperature. section 3

is devoted to the study of p-even dirac fermions. in sect. 4 we discuss the spontaneous

generation of a constant fermion mass triggered by an external magnetic eld. finally our

conclusions are drawn in sect. 5.

2. p-odd fermions

in this section we discuss relativistic fermions coupled with the electromagnetic eld in

(2 + 1)-dimensions. the relevant lagrangian is:

lqed = 

1
4

f(x)f (x) + (x)[i 6   e 6 a (x)  m](x) .

(12)

from the lagrangian eq. (12) it is easy to obtain the equations of motion. in particular the

fermion elds satisfy the familiar dirac equation :

(i    e  a  m)  = 0 .

the gamma matrices satisfy the cliord algebra :

{, } = 2 g,  = g  i,  = g

(13)

(14)

with the at minkowski metric is g = diag(1,1,1).
a spinorial representation in three dimensions is provided by two-component dirac spinors.

the fundamental representation of the cliord algebra is given by 2 2 matrices which can
be constructed from the pauli matrices:

0 = 3, 1 = i1, 2 = i2 .

(15)

we can dene the parity and time-reversal transformation [1]

4

pa0(~x, t)p1 = a0(~x, t)
pa1(~x, t)p1 = a1(~x, t)
pa2(~x, t)p1 = a2(~x, t)
p (~x, t) p1 = 1(~x, t)

with ~x = (x1, x2) and ~x = (x1, x2),

t a0(~x, t)t 1 = a0(~x,t)
t ~a (~x, t)t 1 =  ~a(~x,t)
t (~x, t) t 1 = 2(~x,t) .

(16)

(17)

note that in this representation the mass term m  is odd under both p and t transfor-
mations [1]. it is important to point out that this parity-violating mass is, in fact, the only

possibility in the two-component formalism.

let us consider, now, the hamiltonian in the xed-time temporal gauge a0 = 0 :

h = z d2x(cid:26)1

2

~e2(x)+

1
2

b2(x) + (x)[i~  ~ + m](x) +

 e(x)~  ~a(x)(x)o ,

(18)

where  = 0 and ~ = 0~.

note that in two spatial dimensions the magnetic eld is a (pseudo-)scalar. we are interested

in the case of spinorial quantum electrodynamics in presence of a background eld. so that

we write :

ak(x) = ak(x) + k(x).

(19)

where (x) is the uctuation over the background a(x) .

we consider a background eld which corresponds to an uniform magnetic eld. thus in

the so-called landau gauge we have :

ak(x) = k2x1b k = 1, 2 .

(20)

5

inserting eq. (19) into eq. (18), in the one loop approximation we rewrite the hamiltonian

as :

h0 = h + hd + v

b2
2

= z d2x(cid:26) 1

2

~e2(x) +

1
2

[ijij(x)]2(cid:27) +

+z d2xn(x)[k(ik  e ak) + m](x)o + v

b2
2

where v is the spatial volume. in this approximation the dirac equation reduces to:

i

(~x, t)

t

= [~  (i~  e~a) + m] (~x, t) .

(21)

(22)

as it is well known the dirac equation eq. (22) can be exactly solved [13]. indeed, taking

(~x, t) = eiet(~x),

we get :

[~  (i~  e~a) + m](~x) = e(~x).

it is straightforward to obtain the solutions of eq. (23) (we assume eb > 0) :

e = +en , n  1 (+)

note that due to the zero modes eq. (24c) the spectrum is not charge symmetric (see fig. 1).

the landau levels are innitely degenerate with density of states:

(28)

it is convenient to expand the fermion eld operator (~x) in terms of the wave function basis

(29)

(30)

we observe that in the case of positive mass the positive solutions have eigenvalues +en

with n  0 and negative ones en with n  1 and vice versa in the case of negative
mass. in the expansion of  we associate particle operators to positive energy solutions and

antiparticle operators to negative energy solutions. these operators satisfy the standard

anticommutation relations:

{ai(n, p), aj(n, p)} = {bi(n, p), bj(n, p)} = ij nn (p  p)

the others anticommutators being zero. the dirac hamiltonian operator

hd = z d2x [(x)(i~  ~  ~  ~a + m) (x)]

in the furrys representation reads:

(38)

(39)

therefore we see that in the massless limit the magnetic eld gives origin to a fermion

condensate only in the case of a vanishing negative mass term.

we consider, now, the background eld eective action. as it is well known, in the one-loop

approximation the background eld eective action coincides with the vacuum energy in

presence of the static background eld. in our case we need to evaluate the vacuum energy

density in presence of the constant magnetic eld b.

to this end we need to evaluate the dirac energy, ed, dened as :

8

ed = h0|hd|0i

h0|0i

(40)

where |0i is the fermion vacuum. by using eqs. (33) , (34), it is straightforward to obtain
the dirac energy:

(51)

in figures 2 and 3 we plot eq. (50) and (51) respectively as a function of  for two dierent

values of .

as it is evident the background eld eective potential displays a negative minimum only

in the case of fermions with negative mass term [5]. indeed, using the expansion :

(52)

(53)

we see that the negative linear term, which is absent in the positive mass case, is responsible

of the negative minimum in vacuum energy density.

it is worthwhile to evaluate the thermal corrections to the condensate and to the vacuum

energy density. our approximation corresponds to perform the thermal average with respect

to the one-loop hamiltonian h0, eqs. (21). we introduce the symbol h...i to mean the
thermal average with respect to the hamiltonian h0. let us observe that hanpanpi and
hbnpbnpi can be expressed in terms of the equilibrium occupation number n(p):

n(p) = hanpanpi = 1  hanpanpi =

1

een + 1

,

1  n(p) = hbnpbnpi = 1  hbnpbnpi =

1

een + 1

.

10

(54)

(55)

it is, now, easy to evaluate the fermion condensate at nite temperature. we have for m < 0:

(57)

one can check that this last expression holds for both positive and negative mass.

if we perform the massless limit, then we face with the problem of the order of the limits

m  0 and   . indeed we have:

h i = 0

h i =

while

.

(58)

(59)

of course eq. (58) agrees with the zero temperature result. on the other hand, eq. (59)

shows that the massless limit of the fermion condensate at any temperature is t-independent
and symmetric in m . thus, the fermion condensate h i is a non-analytic function at
the origin in the (m, t )-plane and its limit value depends on the order of the zero-mass

and -innity limit . this non-analitycity of the thermal condensate is also present in the

p-invariant formulation of the theory [14], as we will see in the next section. a similar non-

analyticity has been noticed by the authors of ref. [15] in the study of induced quantum

numbers at nite temperature. it is worthwhile to stress that the presence of a heat bath,

even with an innitesimal temperature, makes the massless limit of the condensate symmet-

ric and dierent from zero. moreover, from eq. (59) we see that the fermion condensate of

the zero mass theory in presence of an external constant magnetic eld corresponds to half

lled zero modes [11].

let us turn on the nite temperature eective potential. as it is well known, the relevant

quantity is the free energy density. we have :

11

where z is the partition function

f = 

1


ln z ,

z = t r(eh) .

in the one-loop approximation we get :

f0 = 

1


ln z0, z0 = t rheh0i .

(60)

(61)

(62)

in our approximation the free energy is the sum of the photonic and fermionic contributions.

only the latter depends on the magnetic eld. so that the calculation of the free energy

reduces to consider the partition function of relativistic fermions in presence of the magnetic

eld.

we consider the case m > 0. a standard calculation gives :

z0 = t re(hd+ v b2

2

) = e v b2

2 (1 + ee0)nd

where nd is the degeneracy of the landau levels:

nd =

in eqs. (65) and (66) the rst term on the right hand side arises from the negative and

positive landau levels with n > 0, the second one is the zero mode contribution, while the

last two terms correspond to the zero temperature vacuum energy density.

to calculate the sums in eqs. (65) and (66) we expand the logarithm:

the sum over k is rapidly convergent. so that this last expression is amenable to numerical

evaluations. putting it all together we nally get :

in figures 4 and 5 we display the free energy density, respectively eq. (72) and eq. (73),

for dierent temperatures t = t
|m|

and  = |m|

e2 = 0.1, as a function of  = eb
m2 .

it is remarkable to observe that in the case m < 0 by increasing the temperature the negative

minimum does not disappear. this means that at high temperature there is not restoration

13

of the symmetry broken at zero temperature. in other words, the spontaneous generation

of the magnetic condensate survives even at innite temperature. remarkably enough, the

authors of ref. [10], within a dierent approach, found similar results also in presence of the

chern-simon term .

it is interesting to study the high temperature asymptotic expansion of the free energy

density in the case of negative mass. indeed we have :

so that:

(74)

(75)

(76)

we see that the linear term in |m| gives rise to the negative minimum at any nite temper-
ature. moreover, the slope of the linear term coincides with the one at zero temperature.

this is clearly seen in fig. 6 where we display the free energy density without the classical

energy b2
2

for three dierent values of the temperature.

the negative minimum of eq. (76) is at

eb =

e2|m|
4

.

as a consequence the negative condensation energy is :

f m<0

0

(b) = 

eb
2 |m| = 

e2|m|2
322

.

(77)

(78)

the minimum of eq. (77) coincides with the zero temperature minimum in the weak-

coupling region  >> 1 :

eb
m2 =

1

4

.

14

(79)

we would like to conclude this section by stressing that our results show that the negative

minimum in the free energy density is due to the term linear in the magnetic eld. this

term, in turn, is accounted for by the contributions due to the zero modes, and it is present

only for negative fermion mass. moreover, we nd that the thermal corrections to the above

mentioned coecient are small and vanish at innite temperature. for these reasons we

feel that higher order corrections do not should modify the spontaneous generation of the

magnetic condensate .

3. p-even fermions

in three dimensions we have a realization of the dirac algebra which is dierent from the

2  2 representation eq. (15). in this representation the dirac fermions are four-component
spinor and the three 4  4 -matrices can be taken to be [17]:
2 = 


0 = 


1 = 


0 i1

0 i2

0 3




.

(80)

i2

the representation given by eq. (80) corresponds to a reducible representation of the dirac

algebra. in this representation the fermionic mass term m  is parity conserving. indeed,

comparing eq. (15) with eq. (80) we see that a four-component fermion with mass m

corresponds to two two-component fermions with mass m amd -m respectively.

as the rst step, we need to solve the dirac equation eq. (23) with the dirac algebra

representation eq. (80).

indeed, it is straightforward to obtain the orthonormal positive

and negative energy solutions of eq. (23). we get :

(83)

we stress that the density of the states for the zero modes is |eb|

 for the modes
with n  1. as already noticed, this is due to the fact that for n  1 a four-component
fermion corresponds to two independent degenerate two-component fermions.

2 while it is |eb|

as in the previous section to calculate the condensate at t = 0, we expand the eld operator

on the basis of the wave functions eqs. (81a-d), (82a,b):

[ai(n, p)(+)

i,n,p + bi (n, p)()
i,n,p]

(84)

where the operators ai and bi satisfy the anticommutation relations eq. (31).

it is possible to obtain the fermion condensate at t = 0 through the propagator g(x, y) =

h0|t (x) (y)|0i:

h0| |0i =  lim
xy

trg(x, y)

(85)

by using the schwinger proper time approach [18]. however, in the furrys representation

and in the one-loop approximation it is rather simple to obtain the condensate at t = 0:

h0| |0i = 

eb
2 

m

.

the massless limit of the condensate reads :

h0| |0i|m0 = 

eb
2

.

m
|m|

(86)

(87)

although the massless limit of the fermion condensate is non-vanishing, it depends on the

sign of m. this means that the limit value does depend on the limiting procedure. for

instance, if one performs that symmetric massless limit, then one gets a vanishing conden-

sate. as a matter of fact, we shall show below that at any nite temperature the fermion

condensate vanishes for m  0. to see that, we evaluate the thermal correction to the

17

condensate. in our approximation and taking into account eqs. (54), (55) and (84), it is

straightforward to calculate the nite temperature fermion condensate. we get:

h i =

|m|

eb

xn=1

(88)

this expression is in agreement with ref. [14], where the authors calculate the value of

the condensate at nite temperature using the thermo eld dynamics [19] approach with a

non-vanishing chemical potential.

let us consider the limits m  0 and   . we have:
eb

h i = 

m
|m|

lim

,

(89)

which, of course, agrees with eq. (87). on the other hand, for any temperature we have:

lim

m0h i = 0 .

(90)

thus, we see that the (2 + 1)-dimensional p-even massless fermion condensate in presence

of a constant magnetic eld is highly unstable. in fact the thermal condensate disappears

as soon as a heat bath is introduced.

let us, now, turn on the eective potential. again we need to evaluate the dirac energy ed.

to this end we rewrite the one-loop hamiltonian eq. (21) by using the expansion eq. (84).

for the dirac hamiltonian hd we nd :

hd = z dp e0 [a(0, p)a(0, p) + b(0, p)b(0, p)] +

xn=1 xi=1,2z dp en [ai (n, p)ai(n, p) + bi (n, p)bi(n, p)]

(91)

as a consequence the dirac energy dened by eq. (40) is:

ed(b) =

proceeding as in the previous section we dene the vacuum energy density. we get:

where the function g() is given by eq. (47).

note that, if we rewrite the last term on the right hand size of eq. (93) by using the integral

representation eq. (47), and after some manipulations, we get:

as concern the nite temperature eective potential we follow the same steps as in the

previous section. the partition function is :

zero-temperature limit of eq. (97) reduces to eq. (93).

in figure 7 we plot the free energy density as a function of  for three values of temperature

t . as it is evident the spontaneous generation of an uniform magnetic condensate is not

energetically favorable neither at zero temperature nor at any nite temperature.

4. dynamical generation of mass in external magnetic field

in this section we investigate the spontaneous generation of the fermion mass in presence of

an external magnetic eld. let us consider massless dirac fermions in an external constant

magnetic eld. the relevant lagrangian is now :

19

lqed(x) = (x)(i  ea)(x) 

1
4

f(x)f (x)

(98)

recently there has been renewed interest in the dynamical symmetry breaking in (2 + 1)-

dimensional qed. in particular it turns out that in planarqed a constant magnetic eld

leads to the dynamical generation of a p-even mass for four-component dirac fermions [21].

in order to investigate the dynamical symmetry breaking we must consider the eective

action for composite operators [22]. for the problem of spontaneous generation of a fermion

mass the eective action will depend on the complete fermion propagator of the theory.

however we restrict ourselves to the case of a constant external source coupled to the local

operator

(x)(x).

in this case the external source acts like a fermion mass m, so that the eective action

depends on the full propagator for massive fermion elds. moreover, owing to the translation

invariance of the problem, we need to consider the eective potential. according to ref. [22],

the relevant quantity turns out to be:

(b, m) = ve(b, m)  ve(b, 0) ,

(99)

where ve(b, m) is the eective potential in presence of both the magnetic eld and the

constant fermion mass. moreover we have the well known physical interpretation that:

ve(b, m) =

1
v

h0m|h|0mi
h0m|0mi

(100)

where |0mi indicates the ground state of the massive theory, and h is the massless hamil-
tonian:

h = z d2x" b2

2

+ (i~  ~  e~  ~a)# .

(101)

our strategy is to consider a trial vacuum state which depends on the variational parameter

m, and thus determine the eective potential by minimizing the vacuum energy density.

we are interested in the case of a given uniform external magnetic eld. in this case, in the

one-loop approximation the hamiltonian reduces to:

20

h = z d2x" b2

2

+ (i~  ~  e~  ~a)#

(102)

where ~a is given by eq. (20). to evaluate the eective potential we need to calculate the

expectation value of the massless hamiltonian eq. (102) on the massive fermion ground

state.

the case of p-even mass term has been extensively discussed in the literature [21]. therefore

we restrict to the case of p-odd dirac fermions.

let us consider, rstly, the case of a negative mass term m = |m|. the massive ground
state |0mi have been already constructed in sect. 2. using the results of that section we
nd:

note that, as expected, the eective potential (b, m) depends on |m|. by using the integral

equation (112) tell us that the one-loop eective potential (b, m) displays an absolute

maximum at m = 0. moreover it turns out that (b, m) < 0 (see fig. 8). so that it is

energetically fovourable to generate a constant fermion mass.

remarkably, a straightforward calculation shows that in the one-loop approximation the

eective potential (b, m) given by eq. (107) accounts for the dynamical generation of a

constant mass also in the case of four component fermions. as a consequence the remark-

able phenomenon of the dynamical generation of a p-even fermion mass in presence of an

external constant magnetic elds displays itself even in the one-loop approximation. note

that the minimum of the one-loop eective potential is obtained for innite value of the

mass. however, we feel that this result is an artefact of the one-loop approximation. in

22

fact, including the higher-order corrections should give rise to a negative minimum for nite

value of the fermion mass.

5. conclusions

in this paper we have discussed in details the dynamics of (2+1)-dimensional dirac fermions

coupled to an external magnetic eld in the one-loop approximation both at zero and nite

temperature.

in particular we investigated in the two formulations the spontaneous generation af the

magnetic condensate both at t = 0 and t 6= 0. our results show that in the one-loop
approximation the remarkable phenomenon of spontaneous generation of an uniform mag-

netic condensate takes place only in the case of dirac fermions with negative p-odd mass.

moreover the magnetic condensation survives the thermal corrections even at innite tem-

perature.

in addition at high temperature the thermal uctuations tend to increase the

condensation energy and the strength of the induced magnetic eld .

remarkably, as discussed in the introduction, it turns out that p-odd dirac fermions are

relevant for the descriptions of zero modes localized on a domain wall in the case of four

dimensional fermions coupled with a scalar eld.

indeed it has been suggested [9] that

the spontaneous generation of an uniform magnetic condensate gives rise to ferromagnetic

domains walls at the electroweak phase transition . this, in turns, may have far reaching

consequences during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe.

we also showed that even in the one-loop approximation a constant magnetic eld is a

strong catalyst for the spontaneous generation of a fermion mass. in particular we nd that

the spontaneous generation of a constant fermion mass does not depend on the spinorial

representation for the dirac matrices. so that an external constant magnetic eld induces

the generation of both a constant p-even and p-odd fermion mass.

finally, we discussed the massless limit of the fermion condensate for both p-even and p-

odd dirac fermions in an external magnetic eld. for both formulations we nd that the

23

massless limit of the condensate is non-analytic. remarkably, it turns out that in presence

of a heat bath, even with vanishing temperature, the fermion condensate survives to the

massless limit only for p-odd two-component fermion elds. moreover, in that case the

massless limit is symmetric.

in conclusions, our results show that, within the one-loop approximation, the unique the-

ory displaying a non-trivial ground state turns out to be the three-dimensional quantum

electrodynamics in interaction with two-component dirac fermion elds.
