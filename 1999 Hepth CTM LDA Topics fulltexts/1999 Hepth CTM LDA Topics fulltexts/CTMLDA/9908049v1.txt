abstract

in this thesis we will discuss various aspects of noncommutative geometry

and compactied little-string theories.

first we will give an introduction to the use of noncommutative geom-
etry in string theory. thereafter we will present a proof of the connection
between d-brane dynamics and noncommutative geometry. this proof was
made in collaboration with edna cheung. then we will explain the concept
of instantons in noncommutative gauge theories which will be relevant for
the last chapters.

the last chapters shift the focus to little-string- and (2, 0)-theories. we
study compactications of these theories on tori with twists. first we study
the case of two coinciding branes in detail. this is based on work with edna
cheung and ori ganor. finally we study the case of an arbitrary number of
coinciding branes. the main result here is that the moduli spaces of vacua
for the twisted compactications are equal to moduli spaces of instantons on
a noncommutative torus. a special case of this is that a large class of gauge
theories with n = 2 supersymmetry in d = 4 or n = 4 in d = 3 has moduli
spaces which are moduli spaces of instantons on noncommutative tori. this
work was done in collaboration with edna cheung, ori ganor and andrei
mikhailov.

1. introduction to noncommutative

geometry in string theory

noncommutative geometry was invented by mathematicians as
a generalization of the notion of a topological space. alain connes
book [1] is an exposition to these ideas. here we will focus on its im-
plications in string and gauge theory. noncommutative geometry en-
tered string theory in the fall of 1997 in the paper by connes,douglas
and schwarz [2]. here matrix theory for m-theory on t d was con-
sidered. one can put a background value for the 3-form potential
of m-theory with one index along the lightlike circle and 2 indices
along t d. we see that we need d  2 to do this. in that paper it
was argued that the matrix model is a gauge theory on a noncom-
mutative torus. following sen and seiberg [3,4] the matrix model
for m-theory in a certain background is given by the dynamics of
d0-branes in the same background in a certain limit. the limit is
such that the resulting theory becomes a gauge theory when d  3 or
another kind of eld theory without gravity for higher d. the 3-form
potential with one lightlike index becomes an ns-ns b-eld.

we see that the question of the role of noncommutative geometry
in string theory can be phrased solely in terms of d-branes in a
background bn s-eld. the connection to matrix theory then follows
trivially.

we thus consider the following question. consider type iia
compactied on t 2 of radii r1, r2 with a constant bn s-eld along
t 2. higher dimensional tori can be dealt with in a similar way. let
the string mass and coupling be ms and g. dene n s = 1
n s is a pure number. the gauge invariance of bn s makes n s
periodic with period 1. let us put n0 d0-branes and n2 d2-branes
in this background. we will take the limit

2rt 2 bn s.

this limit is the usual matrix theory limit, which gives a gauge theory
decoupled from gravity. we want to give a description of this system.
a method for dealing with d0-branes on a torus was developed
by taylor [5] and ganor,ramgoolam and taylor [6]. this was taken
further by connes,douglas and schwarz [2]. the method is to con-
sider d0-branes described the quantum mechanics lagrangian

here xi, i = 1, . . . , 9 are hermitian matrices,  are majorana-weyl
spinors of so(1,9) and

and similarly for d0. this action has a supersymmetry

(4)

with ij = [i, j] there is also a nonlinearly realised supersymmetry

xi =0
 =

(5)

rermark that the last symmetry only acts in the u (1) part of u (n ).
to deal with d0-branes on a t 2 we should make x1, x2 periodic.
since eld congurations that dier by a u (n ) gauge transformation
should be identied the periodicity of x1, x2 means that there exist
unitary operators u1, u2 such that

(6)

we will take solutions of these equations to describe a certain d0-
brane conguration on t 2. remark that n0,n2 and n s appear
nowhere. we then expect that there are several classes of solutions
to these equations, one class for each choice of n0,n2 and n s.

by taking the trace of the above equations it is readily seen that
these equations do not admit nite dimensional matrix solutions.
the natural thing is to look for solutions where ui,xi and  are
operators in an innite dimensional hilbert space. this innite di-
mensionality just reects that there are innitely many d0-branes
on the covering space of the t 2.

1 u 1
2

let us now discuss the solutions of these equations. it is easily
seen that u1u2u 1
commutes with all xi and . since we
are interested in an irreducible representation of xi and  schurs
lemma tells us that u1u2u 1
2 must be a constant. since u1,u2
are unitary the constant must be on the unit circle in the complex
plane. we thus have

1 u 1

u1u2 = e2iu2u1

(7)

we will later see that the interpretation of  is that  = n s =
1

2rt 2 bn s.

u1 and u2 generate an algebra. if  = 0 this is the algebra of
functions on a t 2: for instance we could take u1 = eix1,u2 = eix2.
for nonzero  this algebra is known as the noncommutative torus,
t 2
 . the point of noncommutative geometry is that often one does
not need the actual space but only the algebra of functions on the
space. there is a one-to-one correspondence between topological
spaces and commutative c -algebras. whereas it is hard to gener-
alize the space to a noncommutative space it is straightforward
to drop the requirement that the c -algebra be commutative. the
 is a natural generalisation of t 2, and is henceforth called
algebra t 2
the noncommutative torus. remark that  is periodic with period 1.
solving eq.(6) involves nding a hilbert space and the set of op-
erators x, obeying eq.(6). another way of saying this is to say that
 , and x1,x2 are connections in
the hilbert space is a module over t 2
this module and xi i > 2 and  are endomorphisms of the module.
we will not explain the mathematics here. an exposition is given in
[2,7] among others. for  = 0 the solution is given by bundles over
t 2 [6]. the modules are the sections of these bundles. in the non-
commutative case there is no space anymore and we can not dene
bundles in the usual way. the modules are the right generalisation.
now we will explicitly describe these modules following [8,9]. let

(18)

where f is a constant. by plugging d1,d2 into eq.(17)we see that

(19)

the most general connection is this one plus an arbitrary adjoint
section:

i = di + ai

(20)

now let us solve our original equations, eq.(6). xi, i 6= 1, 2 and
 commute with u1 and u2. u1 and u2 are constructed such that
any function of 1 and 2 commute with it. we thus conclude that
xi, i 6= 1, 2, can be any adjoint section, i.e. it solves eq.(16)and is

6

a function of 1,2, but must not contain derivatives. in mathemat-
 . x1,x2
ical terms they are endomorphisms of the module over t 2
are solved by

x1 =i1
x2 =i2

(21)

where 1,2 are arbitrary connections of the module. the elds
xi, should also be hermitian as always for d0-branes. now we
have the elds of the theory. the action is given by the time integral
of eq.(2). the only thing we still need to specify is the denition of
the trace. the trace is always taken of an endomorphism. let  be
an endomorphism, i.e. it obeys eq.(16). first we can take the trace
of  as a n n matrix. the trace of eq.(16)shows that tr(1, 2) is
a periodic function of 1, 2. it makes sense to integrate tr(1, 2)
over 1, 2. we thus dene

t r(1, 2) = cz d1d2tr(1, 2)

(22)

we only need to x the constant,c. a natural normalisation, which
is consistent with the commutative case  = 0, is the following. let
f12 be the eld strength of a connection 

f12 = [1,2]

then t r(f12), which is a topological invariant, should satisfy

z d1d2tr(1, 2)

(28)

here (1, 2) is any endomorphism. notice that when  = 0 we get
the usual denition of the trace. notice also that t r1 = n  m.
let us shortly recapitulate. we have solved the equations for
the compactication of the d0-brane quantum mechanics. the most
general solution depended on integers m, n and an angle . we got
an action for the elds. the only ambiguity was the denition of the
trace. what we will do now is to identify the parameters in terms of
the physical parameters n0,n2 and n s. we will also calculate the
mass of some bps-states and compare with the correct result, which

8

is known from type iia string theory. the agreement of these bps
masses will prove the correctness of the denition of the trace and
give some evidence for the relevance of modules over noncommutative
tori to d-brane dynamics. in chapter 2 we will provide a proof that
this noncommutative gauge theory is indeed the correct answer.

let us rst match the parameters n, m,  with the number of d0-

branes,n0, the number of d2-branes,n2 and n s = 1
n s = 0 we understand the situation very well. the system is de-
scribed by a gauge theory obtained after t-duality on both directions
of t 2. after t-duality there are n0 d2-branes and n2 d0-branes giv-
ing a u (n0) gauge theory with rst chern class, c1 = n2. comparing
with the module above we get

2rt 2 bn s. for

n =n0
m =n2

(29)

and  = 0, since there is no noncommutativity. for general n s the
relation (29) must still hold since n, m, n0, n2 are integers and cannot
change continously. we know from string theory that in the presence
of a bn s-eld the eective number of d0-branes is n0  n sn2.
since the combination n m appears all over in the above construc-
tion we are led to n s = . in other words the noncommutativity
parameter is set exactly by the bn s-ux.

let us now calculate the energy of some bps states. first we take
the lowest energy state which just corresponds to the pure d0,d2-
brane system with no excitations. this state preserves 16 super-
charges. in the noncommutative gauge theory this is given by setting

 =0
xi =0
x1 =id1
x2 =id2

i = 3, . . . , 9

(30)

the energy, which can be calculated classically since it is a bps state,

is

let us compare this with the correct result known from string theory.
n2 d2-branes wrapped on a t 2 with a bn s has an eective d0-brane
number, n sn2. if there are n0 d0-branes in addition, the eective
d0-brane number is n0  n sn2 = n  m. the energy of d0- and
d2-branes add in quadrature. one way of understanding this is to
t-dualize along a single direction and get a diagonal wound d-string.
this t-dual picture also explains the shift n0  n0  n sn2, since
n s makes the t-dual torus non-rectangular. the energy is thus

which we consider, the rst term goes to innity, the second term
stays nite and all higher terms vanish. the rst term is well known
from matrix theory. it is equivalent to the term n
r which is always
subtracted. the second term is the interesting one which should
be reproduced by the sym action. this story is also well known
from expanding the born-infeld action, where the rst term is the
background energy of the brane, the second term is the sym action
and higher terms are suppressed at low energy.

by comparing the second term in eq.(32)with the energy obtained
from the noncommutative sym, eq.(31), we nd agreement. we also
obtained a further understanding for the ubiquity of the expression
n  m.
let us now consider the d0,d2-brane system with momentum
and fundamental string winding along the cycles of the t 2. for
generic momenta and winding this state preserves 8 supercharges,
but for special values 16 supercharges are preserved. let us just look
at a particular example of a 16 supercharge state. the others can
be done similarly but with a bit more work. we consider a state
with n0 d0-branes, n2 d2-branes, k units of momentum along the
rst axis and w units of fundamental string winding along the second
axis. by performing a t-duality along the rst axis this becomes a
wrapped d-string and a wrapped fundamental string. they combine
into a maximally supersymmetric state when they are parallel. the
condition for that is

wn0 = kn2

(34)

if they are not parallel they will form a string web. we will only con-
sider the parallel case. the energy of the state is readily calculated

11

since the dierent contributions add in quadrature. the fact that
they add in quadrature is particularly clear from the t-dual picture.

again it is the nite terms which should be compared with the gauge
theory.

let us now turn to the noncommutative gauge theory and repro-

duce this state. let us consider the elds of the form

x1 =id1 + a(t)1
x2 =id2

(37)

where d1,d2 are the connections given in eq.(18). a(t) is a function
of time. remark that a(t) multiplies the unit element in endt 2
(e).
we are going to take a(t) to be linear in time. the corresponding
eld strength is then constant and we see from the supersymmetry
variations, eq.(4),eq.(5), that the corresponding state preserves 16
supercharges. this especially means that the energy receives no cor-
rections. let us write down the lagrangian for these elds, obtained



12

by plugging into eq.(2).

this action is very simple and we can easily nd the energy levels.
the only thing we need to know is the period of a. a is periodic,
because there are gauge transformations that shift a. a similar story
holds, of course, in the commutative case,  = 0, where it is more
well known. let d = gcd(n, m) then the period of a is

a  a + m2

sr1

(39)

this is not hard to show, but we will not present the calculation here.

where l is the integer quantum number for the conjugate momentum

(41)

we now see that there is perfect agreement with the string theory
result, eq.(36).

this nishes our treatment of comparing bps masses. we will
not discuss the less supersymmetric states. this is done in detail in
the literature, [10,11,12].

13

in this chapter we have argued that the d-brane system with
bn s ux is desrcribed by gauge theory on a noncommutative torus.
firstly we obtained it as a solution to the quotient conditions eq.(6),
secondly bps masses agree exactly.
in the next chapter we will
provide a proof of this connection from a worldsheet point of view.
before we do this we need to explain another equivalent formulation
of gauge theory on a noncommutative torus.

we saw that the elds of the gauge theory were connections and
endomorphisms over the noncommutative torus. this is beautiful
from a mathematical point of view, but from a practical point of view
it would be preferable to work with ordinary functions or sections of
a bundle.
indeed there is a way of reformulating the theory to a
theory of ordinary functions or sections. let us here explain the case
of n2 = 0. in this case the elds could be considered as functions,
(1, 2), of noncommuting variables 1,2

let us now consider ordinary commuting variables, s1,s2, of the same
period as 1,2. we can dene a map from (1, 2) to a function

14

f (s1, s2) = xn1,n2

(46)

the gauge theory action can thus be formulated in terms of ordi-
nary functions but with the -product replacing any normal product.
this presentation is more suitable for standard quantum eld theory
treatment. we remark that the action is nonlocal. the eect of the
exponential is to introduce nonlocal interactions along the rst axis
for processes which have a momentum transfer in the 2. direction or
vice versa.

2. worldsheet derivation of noncommutative

geometry from d0-branes in a background b-eld

in this chapter we continue the study d0-branes in type iia on t 2
with a background b-eld turned on. we calculate explicitly how the
background b-eld modies the d0-brane action. the eect of the
b-eld is to replace ordinary multiplication with a noncommutative
-product. this theory is exactly the non-local 2+1 dim sym theory
on a dual t 2 proposed by connes, douglas and schwarz, which was
discussed in chapter 1. we calculate the radii and the gauge coupling
for the sym on the dual t 2 for all choices of longitudinal momentum
and membrane wrapping number on the t 2.

2.1. introduction

last fall connes, douglas and schwarz [2] made a very inter-
esting proposal relating the matrix theory of m-theory on t 2 with
a background three form potential, c12, to a gauge theory on a
noncommutative torus. shortly after douglas and hull justied this
claim by relating these theories to a theory on a d-string [13]. they
also mentioned that this could be seen in the original 0-brane picture.

the purpose of the present paper is to precisely incorporate the
background b-eld in the dynamics of 0-branes. in this way we will
obtain the matrix model for m-theory on t 2 with c12 6= 0. it con-
rms the claims made by connes,douglas and schwarz. the theory
is a sym theory on a dual torus with a modied interaction depend-
ing on the b-eld. the theory contains higher derivative terms of
arbitrarily high power and is thus non-local. we calculate the radii
of the dual torus and the gauge coupling constant. we get a non-
commutative gauge theory for any choice of longitudinal momentum
and number of membranes wrapped around the t 2. the radii and
gauge coupling depend on these numbers.

aspects of the connection between compactications of m-theory
and noncommutative geometry has, among others, been worked out
in [14,15,16].

2.2. zero-branes on t 2 with background b-field

let us consider m-theory on t 2 with radii, r1, r2. the torus is
taken to be rectangular for simplicity. making the torus oblique does
not introduce anything interesting. we are interested in the matrix
description of this theory with a background c-eld, c12 6= 0. here
- denotes the lightlike circle and 1, 2 the directions along the torus.
let the plank mass be m and the radius of the lightlike circle be r.
following [17,18], we take this to mean a limit of spatial compacti-
cations. we also perform a rescaling to keep the interesting energies
nite. the upshot is that we consider m theory on t 2  s1 with
plank mass fm and radii er1, er2, er in the limit er  0 with

i = 1, 2.

(47)

this turns into type iia on t 2 with string mass ms, coupling  and
radii r1, r2 given by

fm 2er = m 2r
fmeri = mri

2 = fm 3er

ri = eri

i = 1, 2.

(48)

furthermore there is a ux of the bij eld through the torus. we
call the ux b:

b = rr1r2c12.

(49)

we are interested in the sector of theory labelled by two integers,
namely the number of d0-branes, n0, and the number of d2-branes,
n2, wrapped on t 2. in this section we will solely be interested in the
case n2 = 0. in the next section we will treat the general case. let
us for the moment set n0=1. this makes us avoid some essentially
irrevalent indices. the generalization to general n0 is straightfor-
ward.

fig. 2: 0-branes on the covering space,r2

the method for dealing with this situation has been developed in
[5,6]. we work with the covering space of t 2, namely r2 and place
0-branes in a lattice (figure 1).

let us label the 0-branes (a, b) where a, b are integers. the open
strings obey dirichlet boundary condition on the 0-branes. this is
the point where we need n2 = 0. if there had been d2-branes, the
0-branes would have been dispersed as uxes inside the 2-branes and
the open strings would have dirichlet boundary conditions on the
2-branes and the above picture does not apply.

the elds in the theory come from quantizing the open strings
and calculating their interactions.
in the limit we are taking,
ms  , only the lowest modes survive and when b = 0 the theory
becomes a sy m quantum mechanics [19,20,21,22,23]. the gauge
group is u () since there are innitely many 0-branes. to be
more precise let us dene a hilbert space on which the elds will be
operators. there is a basis vector for each 0-brane, i.e. the basis is
|a, b > where a, b  z. let  be any eld in theory, then the matrix
element a1b1,a2b2 has the interpretation as a eld which annihilates a
state of an open string starting at a1b1 and ending at a2b2, see gure
2.

the elds of the theory are

the reason for distributing the exponentials in this way will become
clear in a moment. one could put an exponential between (k) and
(k1), but it would be identically 1, so we omitted it. we can
introduce a notation which will make this look simpler. first note
that the interactions always appear with a sum over indices.

if we think of the elds as matrices this is just

now the interaction with a b-eld, eq.(57), can be written

t r((k)  (k1)  . . .  (2)  (1)).

this is really nice.
it shows that to generalize the action eq(52)
to include a b-eld we just need to replace ordinary matrix product

23

(60)

(61)

with -product. for b = 0 the -product coincides with the ordinary
product. this point of view, that the elds take value in another
algebra, was of course the main point of [2].

in the case b = 0 the elds with the constraints eq.(50) and
action can be rewritten to a sy m theory on a dual t 2 [5,6]. let
us briey repeat that construction for the case, b 6= 0. let us rst
express the basis of the hilbert space in another form. we want to
think of the hilbert space as l2 functions on a dual torus with radii,
sr2,

. let the basis vector |ab > correspond to eiaxm2

then the operators u1, u2 become multiplication operators

all this is independent of b. we saw that the only b-dependence
was to change products of elds to the -product. let us see how the
-product looks in this basis. we only need to consider the types of

24

operators which appear in the action. we see from eq.(63) that these
are the dierential operators, 
y , and multiplication operators.

x and 
y are diagonal and it is easily seen from eq.(60) that for
diagonal operators the -product is equal to the usual product. let
us now look at two multiplication operators (1)(x, y) and (2)(x, y).
we have

(65)
let us recapitulate what we have obtained so far. we consider one
0-brane on a t 2, n0 = 1, and no membranes, n2 = 0. the ux of the
bij-eld through the torus is b. we consider the limit coming from
matrix theory. if b = 0 the resulting theory is a 2+1 dim. sym on
a dual t 2. in terms of the m-theory variables the radii of the t 2 are

(66)

(67)

the gauge bundle on t 2 is trivial. this is a consequence of the fact
that all the elds in eq.(63) are functions on t 2 instead of sections

25

of a non-trivial bundle. equivalently c1 = 1
the only dierence is that every time two elds are being multiplied
in the action one should instead use the -product.

2r trf = 0. for any b

when b = 0 the -product, of course, coincides with the usual
product. looking at eq.(60) we see that the product has a periodicity
in b of 4. for b = 2 it is dierent from b = 0. at rst sight
this is problematic, since the theory is known to have a periodicity
in b of 2. the puzzle is resolved by noting that there is a eld
redenition which takes the theory at b = 2 into b = 0. the eld
redenition is

a2b2,a1b1  (1)(a2a1)(b2b1)a2b2,a1b1.

(68)

thus the gauge theories actually have the correct 2 periodicity in
b.

so far we have only discussed the case with n0 = 1 and n2 = 0,
i.e. one 0-brane and no 2-branes. the case with any n0 goes in
exactly the same way. it is now a u (n0) theory instead of a u (1)
theory. nothing else is changed. especially the same form of the
-product should be used, except that now the elds are n0  n0
matrices.

2.3. non-trivial gauge bundles

in the previous section we only considered cases with no mem-
branes, n2 = 0. what about n2 6= 0? in the case b = 0 we know the
answer. here the nal theory is obtained by t-duality on both circles.
after t-duality we get the decoupled theory of n0 d2-branes with
n2 d0-branes dispersed in the 2-branes. 0-branes in 2-branes is just
magnetic ux. in other words now it is a u (n0) theory with a non-
trivial bundle on t 2. the rst chern class is c1 = 1
in the previous section we saw that for b 6= 0 and n2 = 0 the theory
became a u (n0) theory with c1 = 0 and deformed by the -product.
all these theories have radii and coupling given by eq.(66). the
obvious guess is now that the case with b 6= 0 and n2 6= 0 was
described by a u (n0) theory with c1 = n2 and an action deformed

2r trf = n2.

26

by the -product. however this cannot be true, at least not in this
naive sense. the reason is that if the bundle is non-trivial we really
need to dene the elds in coordinate patches. the -product does
not transform correctly under change of patch. to make it do so we
would have to replace 
y by covariant derivatives. even if this is
possible there are other reasons to doubt that this is correct. firstly
b  b + 2 is not a symmetry in the presence of 2-branes. it is only
a symmetry if one changes the number of 0-branes: n0  n0  n2.
for n2 = 1 one could always change to n0 = 0. if the above guess
was correct this would lead to strange connections between u (0)
and u (n ) theories.

x, 

another reason to doubt this naive guess is the following. when
one uses sens and seibergs prescription [17,18] to derive a matrix
model the energy has the form

e =r(

n
r

)2 + p 2

 + m2 =

n
r

+

1
2

r
n

(p 2

 + m2) + . . . .

(69)

here it is written for uncompactied m-theory, but a similar ex-
pression is valid for all compactications. the point is that in the
limit r  0, the rst term goes to innity, the second term stays
nite(after rescaling of all energies) and the terms indicated by dots
vanish. the rst term goes to innity but is xed and independent
of any dynamics. therefore we can ignore it and just keep the sec-
ond term. a matrix theory hamiltonian always gives the second
term. when we change n the theory changes drastically. for in-
stance the gauge group changes. in other words when the innite
term is changed we expect the nite term to change drastically. let
us now look at our situation. with n0 0-branes, n2 2-branes and a
bij-eld ux b. here the energy takes the form

e =

n0 + bn2

r

+ f inite.

(70)

for b 6= 0 the innite term changes when n2 is changed. so follow-
ing the remarks above we expect the theory to change drastically.

27

specically it is probably not enough to change the bundle, but also
radii and gauge coupling changes.

whether or not the case of n2 6= 0 is solved by just changing
the rst chern class, there is another way of solving it. this is the
subject of next section.

2.4. incorporating 2-branes

in this section we will obtain the matrix model for the general
case, with n0 0-branes,n2 2-branes and a ux b. we will do that
by performing a t-duality to transform to the case n2 = 0

for a review of t-duality, see [24]. the t-duality group for iia
on t 2 contains an sl(2, z) subgroup which acts as follows. it leaves
the complex structure of t 2 invariant. dene a complex number in
the upper halfplane,  = b + iv . here v is the volume of the torus
measured in string units and b is the ux of bij through the torus.

let us use this in our case. let q be the greatest common divisor of
n0 and n2. write

n2 = qfn2
n0 = qfn0.

since en0,en2 are relatively prime we can choose a, b such that afn0 
bfn2 = 1. let us now perform a t-duality transformation with the

an easy calculation gives the new radii, bij ux, 0-brane and 2-brane

the string mass is invariant

in these formulas we have taken the matrix theory limit in the quan-
tities which have a non-zero limit. we remark that the denominator

en0 + en2b is positive since

and p is positive as always in matrix theory. we now see that the
parameters of the theory go to zero and innity in exactly the same

situation as in last section.

in other words the matrix theory is a 2+1 dim. sym on a t 2
with gauge group u (q) where q is the greatest common divisor of
n0 and n2. the action is deformed with the -product with a value

the sl(2,z) duality employed has a very easy geometric interpreta-

2.5. conclusion

it was explained in [5,6] how to describe 0-branes on t 2 by work-
ing on the covering space r2 and modding out by translations. we
did this in the presence of a background b-eld. this enabled us to
get a matrix theory of m-theory on t 2 with a background c12. the
result agrees with [2,13] and is a gauge theory on a noncommutative
torus.

there are some interesting aspects of this. in the case b = 0
this procedure leads to a 2+1 dim sym which is exactly the same
as the theory on the d2-brane in the t-dual picture. in other words
the procedure of compactifying the 0-branes agrees with t-duality.
for b 6= 0 this is not the case. t-duality does not give a theory on a
nite torus when b 6= 0. this is the whole reason for all this interest
in b 6= 0. this means that working with 0-branes on the covering
space is not the same as t-duality. we believe, of course, that t-
duality still is true. the point is just that the t-dual description
is not simpler. the t-dual description is the theory on d2-branes
wrapped on a dual t 2 which is again shrinking. to extract a well
dened action out of that one has to expand the full born-infeld
action as advocated in [25]. it would indeed be interesting to use the
noncommutative theory to put constraints on the full born-infeld
action. all the higher derivative terms should come out of this.

originally it was thought that compactications of m-theory
could be gotten by compactifying the 0-brane quantum mechanics.
that was indeed the case for toroidal compactications up to t 3. for
other compactications certain degrees of freedom were missing. it
was later realized that the correct way of obtaining the matrix model
was to use string dualities in order to realise the theory as a theory
living on a brane decoupled from gravity. in the case of c12 6= 0
we are in some sense back to the rst philosophy. we can obtain
the nal theory starting with the 0-brane theory but we do not know
how to realise it as a sensible limit of a theory on a brane.

it is an interesting question whether these new theories make
sense as renormalizable quantum theories. in the case of b = 0 we
know that the procedure of putting 0-branes on the covering space
gives a renormalizable theory up to t 3 and not for higher tori. so cer-
tainly arguing that this procedure should give a well dened theory

31

is wrong. however, one might hope that the question of renormal-
isability is related to the number of degrees of freedom. in that
sense the theory on t d with b 6= 0 behaves like the theory on t d
with b = 0 and we might expect that the noncommutative theories
are well dened up to t 3. realizing these theories as theories on
branes would resolve this issue, but as discussed above this might
require knowing the full born-infeld action.

it will be very interesting to see what the methods of noncom-
mutative geometry can teach us about string theory and the other
way round.

3. instantons in noncommutative gauge theories

in this chapter we will discuss certain aspects of the d0-d4 brane

system because that will be relevant to us in chapter 5.

consider type iia on t 4 with radii, ri,i = 1, . . . , 4, with n4 d4-
branes wrapped on t 4. there is no bn s-eld at the moment. let
the string mass be ms and the coupling be . if msri  1 it is well
known that this system is described by 4+1 dimensional maximally
supersymmetric yang-mills theory on a t 4. a u (n4) bundle on
t 4 is characterised by the chern numbers, which are integers.
in
physical terms the rst chern class corresponds to the number of
d2-branes wrapped on the 6 two-cycles on t 4 and the second chern
class to the number of d0-branes. the moduli space of lowest energy
congurations are the instanton congurations where

f + + + = 0

(81)

here f + means the selfdual part of f and + is a selfdual constant
in the u (1) part of u (n ). especially the su (n ) part is antiselfdual.
of course one could exchange selfdual with antiselfdual above. this
depends on whether there is a positive or negative number of d0-
branes.

let the number of d0-branes be n0. suppose that msri  1.
then we can obtain a description of the same system by a t-duality
on all 4 circles. this will give us a u (n0) gauge theory with chern

congurations are the instanton congurations,

f + + + = 0

(82)

now with the u (n0) gauge eld. we will now make the following
claim. whereas the gauge theory is only a good description when
the radii are big the moduli space of lowest energy congurations is
always equivalent to an instanton moduli space. to our knowledge

33

there is no rigorous proof of this but it is very plausible for the fol-
lowing reasons. the moduli space is a hyperkahler manifold because
of the amount of supersymmetry. an instanton moduli space is also
hyperkahler. they are equal at large radii as explained above. fur-
thermore for very small radii we can perform t-duality to another
instanton moduli space as discussed above. however these two in-
stanton moduli spaces are known to be equal by the so called nahm
transformation [26]. these facts taken together strongly suggests
that the space of lowest energy congurations is given exactly by the
instanton moduli space for all radii, not just large one. this holds
irrespective of what the coupling is.

let us now include the bn s-eld. we consider type iia on t 4
of radii ri as before. there is a ux of the ns-ns b-eld on t 4.

ij is antisymmetric, so there are 6 independent numbers. there are
d0,d2,d4-branes wrapped on cycles of t 4.
in the previous chap-
ters only a two-torus was discussed. however the discussion can
be repeated in any dimension. this time the low energy physics is
described by a gauge theory on a noncommutative t 4. the noncom-
mutative t 4 is dened as the algebra generated by u1,u2,u3 and u4
satisfying

uiuj = e2iij ujui

(84)

bundles, or nitely genrated projective modules, over the noncom-
mutative t 4 are classied by 8 integers, exactly corresponding to the
numbers of d0,d2 and d4 branes wrapped on the original t 4. for a
certain regime of radii,ms and  the low energy physics of this sys-
tem is described by a 4+1 dimensional sym on a noncommutative
t 4. this is not a renormalizable theory, so new degrees of freedom
is needed at high energy. however the lowest energy congurations,
which are bps, can be obtained from the gauge theory. let us recall

(90)

then all  obeying eq.(87)are preserved. so 8 supercharges are pre-
served. this works exactly as in the commutative case, which is a
special case of this. the connections satisfying the instanton equa-
tion, eq.(89), are the ones that preserve half the supersymmetry.

35

locally a connection has the form

i = i + ai

where ai is a matrix valued one-form. the eld strength is

fij = iaj  jai + aiaj  ajai

(91)

(92)

the dierence between the commutative and noncommutative case is
that the matrix entries are functions on respectively a commutative
and a noncommutative space. alternatively one can make the ai
ordinary functions but then the product should be replaced with the
-product dened in eq.(46)

fij = iaj  jai + ai  aj  aj  ai

(93)

we thus see that the instanton equations are being deformed by the
noncommutativity.

let us now discuss the possible singularities in the instanton
moduli space. consider rst the d0-d4 system in type iia on r1,9
without any d2-branes and zero bn s-eld. a d0-brane alone pre-
serves the supersymmetry

0l = r

(94)

where l,r is left and right chirality spinors of so(1, 9). a d4-brane
oriented along directions 1, 2, 3, 4 preserve

01234l = r

(95)

each brane preserves 16 supercharges. if they are both present, sep-
arated from each other, they preserve 8 supercharges, namely the
l,r that obey both equations, eq.(94), eq.(95). this means there
will be no force between a d0-brane and a d4-brane. one can move
the d0-brane into the d4-brane where it can dissolve in a bound
state. this looks like an instanton on the d4-brane worldvolume.
the instanton moduli space has singularities coming from small in-
stantons. the singularities in the instanton moduli space exactly
reects that there is a branch where the branes are separated.

36

let us now turn on a constant bn s-eld along directions 1, 2, 3, 4.
in other words bn s is a closed 2-form on r4. the d0-brane still
preserves

0l = r

(96)

the d4-brane preserves

the formula above is just the lorentzinvariant version of this. let
us check for which b-elds the d0-brane and d4-brane preserves
supersymmetry when they are separated. we will do it in the special

37

lorentzframe, even though it does not make a dierence. we need
to solve eq.(96)and eq.(97). combining them we get

in other words the matrix on the lefthand side needs to have the
eigenvalue +1. 12 and 34 have eigenvalues i and can be diag-
onalised simultaneously. it is easy to see that we need either

or

and

12 = i, 34 = i

12 = i, 34 = i

(101)

(102)

(103)

the lorentz invariant version of the last equation is that bn s is
selfdual. we have thus derived that if and only if bn s is selfdual
can a separated d0-brane and d4-brane preserve supersymmetry.
they preserve 8 supercharges in this case.

what about a bound state of d0-branes and d4-branes. when
bn s = 0 it exists as a bps state. it has a description as instantons,
as we discussed above.
in other words it is a single particle state
in a short multiplet. when we vary bn s the dimension of the rep-
resentation can not jump. we thus conclude that the bound state
always exists as a bps state. this argument has been used often in
string dualities, in going from weak to strong coupling. here we do
not vary the coupling but the bn s-eld.

suppose a d0-brane is bound to n4 d4-branes in the presence
of a bn s-eld. it can be described as an instanton in the noncom-
mutative u (n4) theory. if bn s is not selfdual the d0-brane can not
leave the d4-branes meaning that there is no small instanton. we

38

thus see that the singularities in the instanton moduli space has been
resolved. here we argued from string theory. it would be interest-
ing to conrm this picture directly from the instanton equations. a
discussion of various aspects of noncommutative instantons can be
found in [27,28,29].

this discussion was for the case of r4. it stays valid on t 4, since
the preserved supersymmetry is identical on r4 and t 4. t 4 can be
obtained from r4 by a periodic identication which does not change
any of the above. in chapter 5 we will return to noncommutative
instantons.

4. twisted (2, 0) and little-string theories

now we will leave the realm of noncommutative geometry for
a while.
in this chapter we will study the compactication of the
(2, 0) theory and the little-string theory on s1, t2 and t3. the
(2, 0)-theory describes the low-energy modes coming from type-iib
on an ak1 singularity [30] or, equivalently, k 5-branes of m-theory
[31]. the little-string theory is the theory of k type-ii ns5-branes
decoupled from gravity [32]. in order to get an interesting low-energy
question we will twist the boundary conditions along td by elements
of the spin(5) (or spin(4) for the little-string theory) r-symmetry.
in this way we obtain new kinds of theories with 8 supersymmetries.
the aim of this paper is to nd the low-energy description of these
theories. we will present an explicit construction in the case k = 2.
the construction for k = 2 involves the moduli space of the heterotic
5-brane wrapped on tori.

in certain limits we recover the known moduli spaces of super-
yang-mills theories with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet. in the
compactied little-string theories, examination of the moduli space
shows that for certain values of the external parameters there is a
phase transition to a phase where little-strings condense.

the chapter is organized as follows. in section (4.1) we explain
our notation, present the problem and discuss the parameters on
which the compactications depend. in section (4.2) we present the
general solution for k = 2. in section (4.3) we study in more detail
various limiting cases of the solution.
in particular, we study the
limits where super-yang-mills is obtained. in subsection (4.3.2) we
observe the phase transition. in section (4.4) we explain the relation
between the twist and the mass of the adjoint hypermultiplets in
the eective low-energy description of super-yang-mills. in section
(4.5) we discuss in more detail what it means to twist the little-
string theories. we study what happens to the twists after t-duality
and suggest that the r-symmetry twists are a special case of a more
general twist. we end with a discussion and open problems.

40

4.1. the problem

the problem that we are going to study is to nd the seiberg-
witten curves of certain n = 2 theories in 3+1d and to nd the
hyperkahler moduli space of certain n = 4 theories in 2+1d. the
n = 2 theories will be obtained by compactifying the (2, 0) theory
or, slightly generalizing, the little-string theory, on t2 with twisted
r-symmetry boundary conditions along the sides of the torus. the
n = 4 theories in 2+1d are similarly obtained by compactication
on t3. in this section we will describe the setting and the notation.

denitions let us denote by t (k) the (2, 0) low-energy theory of
k 5-branes of m-theory [30,31]. we denote by sa(k) (sb(k)) the
theory of k type-iia (type-iib) ns5-branes in the limit when the
string coupling goes to zero keeping the string tension xed [32].
compactied on a circle, these two theories are t-dual. t (k) is often
called the (2, 0) theory and s(k) is referred to as the little-string
theory.

the (2, 0) theory and the little-string theories when t (k) is com-
pactied on t2 we get a 3+1d theory which at low-energy becomes
k free vector multiplets (at generic points in the moduli space). the
vector-multiplet moduli space is (s1ir5)k/sk where the size of s1 is
a1/2 and a is the area of t2. when we compactify t (k) on t3 the
low-energy is (generically on the moduli space) given by a -model
on the hyperkahler manifold (t3  ir5)k/sk. the t3 in the moduli
space has the same shape as the physical t3 but its volume is v 1/2,
where v is the volume of the physical t3.
(see [33] for review.)
sa(k) has a low-energy description given by 5+1d sym and has a
scale ms. the scale is related to the sym coupling constant m 1
.
the parameters of the compactication are now the metric on t3
and also the nsns 2-form on t3. the 2-form couples as a -angle in

the eective 5+1d low-energy sym, i.e. asr btr{ff}. together

s

41

they parameterize

so(3, 3, z)\so(3, 3, ir)/(so(3)  so(3))
= sl(4, z)\sl(4, ir)/so(4).

(104)

the moduli space is given by (t4 ir4)k/sk where t4 has the shape
given by the point in sl(4, z)\sl(4, ir)/so(4) and has a xed vol-
ume m 2
s .

we have to mention that the arguments of [34] (see also [35])
show that the theories s(k) are far more complicated than the t (k)
theories, in the sense that they have a continuous spectrum starting
at energy around ms and this spectrum describes graviton states
propagating in a weakly coupled throat. below the scale ms there is
a discrete spectrum (up to the eect of the 4k non-compact scalars).
since there is a mass gap, one can still ask low-energy questions, as
we are doing.

r-symmetry wilson lines the compactications discussed above
have 16 supersymmetries and therefore the moduli spaces obtained
in 2+1d are at and only their global structure is interesting. to
get interesting metrics on the moduli space we need to break the
supersymmetry down by 1
2. this can be done as follows. suppose we
identify a global symmetry of the (2, 0) theory. when we compactify
on s1 of radius r and coordinate 0  x  2r, we can glue the
points x = 0 and x = 2r by adding a twist of the global symmetry.
when we compactify on t3 we can twist along all 3 directions so
long as the twists commute. the global symmetry of t (k) is the
spin(5) r-symmetry. such a twist has been recently used in [36] to
break the supersymmetry of the (2, 0) theory in compactications.

when we compactify the little-string theory sa(k) (sb(k)) it
is not immediately obvious that we can use such a twist because
the space-time interpretation is not unique. however, since we can
embed the twist as a geometrical twist in type-iia, the question is
well dened. we will elaborate more on that point in section (6).

42

let us now take the (2, 0) theory t (k) on t3 with three com-
muting twists g1, g2, g3  spin(5) along t3. the 16 super-charges
of t (k) transform as a space-time spinor which also has indices in
the 4 of spin(5). the condition that 8 supersymmetries will be
preserved is the condition that g1, g2, g3 preserve a two-dimensional
subspace of the representation 4 of spin(5). this becomes the fol-
lowing condition. take su (2)b  su (2)u = spin(4)  spin(5) and
let g1, g2, g3 be 3 commuting elements in the rst su (2)b factor.
this is the generic twist which preserves n = 4 in 2+1d. similarly,
for the little-string theory s(k) the r-symmetry is spin(4) and we
need,

g1, g2, g3  su (2)b  su (2)b  su (2)u = spin(4).

since the gis are commuting they can be taken inside a u (1) sub-
group of su (2)b. then gi = eii  u (1)  su (2)b. the subscripts
b and u are short for broken and unbroken respectively. we
can now ask what is the low-energy description of t (k), sa(k) and
sb(k) compactied, in turn, on s1, t2 and t3 with twists i. the
most general question is about s(k) on t3 since all others can be
obtained by taking appropriate limits. the low-energy description in
2+1d is a -model on a 4(k  1)-dimensional hyperkahler manifold.
we will always ignore the decoupled center of mass. furthermore,
as will be elaborated in section (4), in appropriate limits we obtain
3+1d or 2+1d su (k) sym with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet.
what is the external parameter space? the parameter space for
the metric and b elds on t3 is given by (104). the parameter space
for conjugacy classes of three commuting su (2) r-symmetry twists

is the weyl group of su (2). however, with r-symmetry twists, we
can no longer divide by the full t-duality group so(3, 3, z) (see the
discussion in section (6)). this means that the parameter space is a

along t3 is given by et3/z2 where et3 is the torus dual to t3 and z2
bration of (et3/z2) over

sl(3, z)\so(3, 3, ir)/(so(3)  so(3)).

43

why is the problem not trivially solved by m-theory? let us ex-
plain why we cannot just read o the sw-curves and moduli spaces
from m-theory. to be specic, let us take the 6-dimensional non-
compact space dened as an ir4-bration over t2 with spin(4) twists
along the cycles of the t2. this is the geometric realization of the
r-symmetry twist, that we mentioned above (see section (6) for a
more detailed discussion). m-theory compactied on this space pre-
serves 16 supersymmetries if the two twists 1, 2 are taken inside
su (2)b  su (2)b  su (2)u = spin(4). let us wrap k 5-branes
on t2. given the success of the method described in [37] one may
at rst sight wonder whether the classical moduli space of the k 5-
branes immediately gives the right answer. the answer is negative.
there is, in fact, a big dierence between the situation in [37] and
ours. the construction of [37] was used to solve certain qcd ques-
tions. as explained there, qcd is not the low-energy description
of 5-branes in m-theory. it is not even an approximate one. qcd
is only a good approximation in the region of moduli space where
the 5-branes are close together and the 11th dimension is very small.
when this parameter was increased the dynamics of the system is
completely changed except for the vacuum states (i.e. the moduli
of the vector-multiplets). this relied on the fact that the parame-
ter that deforms the system from close ns5-branes and d4-branes in
type-iia to m5-branes decoupled from the vector-multiplet moduli
space (similarly to the decoupling in [38] and [39,40]). the classical
result was correct for the m5-brane limit because all the relevant
sizes were much larger than mp l (the planck scale).

in our case, not all the relevant sizes of the m5-brane congura-
tion are large. let a be the area of t2 and let  be the modulus
of the tensor multiplet in 5+1d.  is related to the separation y be-
tween the 5-branes as   m 3
p y. the interesting region in moduli
space is a  1. this region is m 3
p ay  1 and at least one of y or
a cannot be made large.

44

4.2. solution

in this section we will consider the theory sa(2) compactied on
t3. we recall that sa(2) is the theory living on 2 coincident ns
5-branes in type iia in the limit of vanishing string coupling with
string scale, ms, kept xed. the compactied theory has a mod-
uli space of vacua which is a hyperkahler manifold. the purpose of
this section is to nd this hyperkahler manifold as a function of the
parameters of the compactication. these parameters are described
above. there is the iia string scale, ms (which is already a param-
eter in 6 dimensions). there is the metric, ga
ij and ns-ns 2-form,
ij, on the t3. here a denotes the underlying type iia theory. fi-
ba
nally, there are the holonomies of the spin(4) r-symmetry around
the 3 circles. the holonomies are taken inside an su (2)b subgroup
of spin(4) to preserve half of the supersymmetries. the 3 holonomies
must commute and can thus be taken inside u (1)  su (2)b. we
denoted the holonomies ei1, ei2, ei3, where i is periodic with pe-
riod 2. furthermore the weyl group of su (2)b relates i to i.
these are the parameters of the theory.
the moduli space of vacua has real dimension 4, since we are
dealing with 2 5-branes and we throw away the center of mass motion.
we want to nd the metric on this as a function of ms, ga
ij and
i. our strategy will be to start at the special point i = 0 and then
later understand how to do the general case. at i = 0 the theory
actually has n = 8 supersymmetry in 3 dimensions (like n = 4 in 4
dimensions). here the moduli space is just the classical one. at the
origin of the moduli space the low energy theory is an su (2), n = 8
theory. there are also heavy kaluza-klein modes with masses that
go like multiples of
in
n = 4 language the multiplet is a vector-multiplet and an adjoint
hypermultiplet. on the the moduli space of vacua su (2) is broken
to u (1). dualizing the photon gives an extra scalar, so the vector-
in the n = 8 theory the moduli space of
multiplet has 4 scalars.
vacua is 8 dimensional. four of the directions come from scalars in
the hypermultiplet. these are lifted as soon as i 6= 0, because i
supply a mass to the hypermultiplet. we are really only interested in

, where ri are the radii of the circles.

the 4 directions coming from scalars in the vector-multiplet. these 4
scalars are all compact. from the 5-brane point of view these scalars
come about as follows. one of them is the relative position of the
5-branes on the 11th circle. the other 3 are the 2-form living on
the 5-brane with indices along the t3. these 4 scalars are obviously
compact. the weyl group of the su(2) gauge group changes the sign
of all these. we thus see that the moduli space of vacua is t4/z2.
when we deform to i 6= 0, the moduli space remains compact. the
only compact 4 dimensional hyperkahler manifolds are k3 and t4.
t4/z2 is topologically a k3 manifold with a singular metric. we
thus conclude that for all parameters ga
ij, i the moduli space is
topologically k3. we just need to nd the hyperkahler metric as a
function of these parameters.

ij, ba

let us rst recall the moduli space of hyperkahler metrics on k3.

it is [41],

o(3, 19, z)\o(3, 19, ir)/((o(3)  o(19))  ir+.

ir+ parameterizes the volume. this moduli space nicely coincides
with the moduli space for heterotic string theory on t3. this is a
well-known consequence of the duality of m-theory on k3 with het-
erotic on t3. on the heterotic side the ir+ denotes the dilaton. the
space o(3, 19, ir)/o(3)  o(19) can be parameterized by the metric
and ns-ns 2-form on the t3, gh
ij and the wilson lines around
the 3 circles v1, v2, v3. we will work with the e8  e8 heterotic
theory. the reason for that will become clear in a moment. there is
a very nice way of obtaining the k3 on the m-theory side as a moduli
space of vacua for a 3-dimensional n = 4 theory. this is the mem-
brane of m-theory imbedded in r1,6  k3 with the world-volume
along r1,6 and at a point in k3. on the dual heterotic side it corre-
sponds to the 5-brane wrapped on t3 [40]. this is thus the moduli
space of the (1, 0) little-string theory obtained from an ns5-brane in
the heterotic string by taking the coupling constant to zero [32].

our aim can now be formulated as nding gh

nal parameters can be combined into scalar components of auxiliary
vector-multiplets which are non-dynamical. supersymmetry then re-
quires that the periods of the three 2-forms which determine the
hyperkahler metric on the moduli space are linear in these combina-
tions of external parameters [43]. to nd the map subject to this
restriction, we rst examine i = 0. we saw earlier that this was
the n = 8 theory and the moduli space is t4/z2. therefore, we can
nd the data of the t4 by classical analysis, starting from the (1, 0)
tensor-multiplet living on the iia 5-brane.
(we have ignored the
vevs along the (1, 0) hypermultiplet direction.) the (1, 0) tensor-
multiplet is also the low-energy description of the e8  e8 heterotic
5-brane and the scalar is compact since it corresponds to motion in
the 11th direction, which is an interval. let us compactify this the-
ory on t3 with data gh
ij , v1, v2, v3. to obtain the same mod-
uli space of vacua as in the sa(2) case we need to set gh = ga,
bh = ba. what about v1, v2, v3? the sa(2) theory had a t4/z2
as moduli space. t4/z2 has 16 a1 singularities. this means that m-
theory on this k3 has su (2)16 gauge symmetry. to achieve this we
need very special wilson lines. we can take v1 to break e8  e8 to
so(16)so(16) and v2 to break each so(16) to so(8)so(8) and
v3 to break each so(8) to so(4) so(4). the unbroken symmetry
group is thus so(4)8 = su (2)16 as desired. these wilson lines are
unique up to e8  e8 conjugation. we can write down v1, v2, v3
explicitly. the two e8s are treated symmetrically, so we restrict to
one of them. consider 8  r8 where 8 is the weight lattice of
e8. recall that 8 can be characterized as all sets (a1, . . . , a8) such
that either all ai are half-integers or all ai are integers. furthermore
p ai is even. a wilson line around a circle can be specied by an
element v  ir16 such that a state given by a weight vector a is
transformed as eiav on traversing the circle. in this notation

now we have the map in the case i = 0. we will make a proposal
for the general case presently. the 16 singularities in t4/z2 are
due to an adjoint hypermultiplet becoming massless. when i 6=
0 the hypermultiplet is massive and we expect the singularities to
disappear. near the original singularities the theory now looks like
pure su (2) sym. this does not have any singularities [40,43]. we
thus see that the wilson lines must change when we turn on i.
we now make the following proposal. for nonzero i we still have
gh
ij. the wilson lines w1, w2, w3 are taken to be,

chosen such that the period is i  i + 2.
we do not have a proof of this proposal, but this certainly satises
the requirements of linearity in external parameters, because this is
also the moduli space of the compactied (1, 0) little-string theory.
in the coming sections we will show that our proposal is consistent
with string theory and eld theory expectation.

there is another very similar theory. this is the theory on 2
coincident type iib ns 5-branes in the limit of vanishing string cou-
pling and xed string mass. we call this theory sb(2). as soon as
we compactify it on a circle it is t-dual to the theory studied above.
when we compactify it on a t3 with r-symmetry twists we get a
3-dimensional theory with a k3 as the moduli space of vacua. argu-
ing exactly as in the iia case we propose that this k3 is given in the
same way as in the iia case, except that we replace heterotic e8e8

48

with heterotic so(32). this is because the low energy description of
the theory living on a iib 5-brane is a gauge theory. the heterotic
so(32) 5-brane is also described, at low energy, by a gauge theory.
when we do the comparison at the point without an r-symmetry
twist, the n = 8 point, the moduli spaces will automatically agree.
this is analogous to the n = 8 point in the iia case where we com-
pared two tensor-multiplets. the t-duality between the iia and iib
5-brane theories on t3 ts very nicely with the t-duality between
heterotic so(32) and heterotic e8  e8 on t3 at the point i = 0.
for i 6= 0, the r-symmetry twists do not remain r-symmetry twists
after t-duality.

4.3. limits

now that we have identied the moduli space of vacua for sa(2)
compactied on t3 with arbitrary r-symmetry twists, we can de-
compactify one or two of the circles to obtain the moduli space of
vacua for sa(2) compactied to 4 and 5 dimensions. another limit
is to take ms   in the sa(2) theory. this takes us to the (2, 0)
theory, which we call t (2).
in this section we will consider these
limits.

decompactication limits

let us rst recall the correspondence between m-theory on k3
and heterotic e8  e8 on t3. m-theory on k3 has a planck mass,
mp l, and a moduli space

o(3, 19, z)\o(3, 19, ir)/((o(3)  o(19))  ir+

ir+ denotes the volume of k3, vol (k3). in heterotic e8  e8 on t3
there is a string mass, ms, and a moduli space, which is the same
as for m-theory on k3. there is a 10-dimensional string coupling, .
the t3 has a volume, vol(cid:0)t3(cid:1), which is part of o(3, 19, ir)/(o(3)

o(19)). under the duality an m5-brane wrapped on k3 is mapped

49

to the heterotic string. equating the tensions gives,

mp l

6 vol (k3) = m 2
s .

equating the 7-dimensional gravitational couplings gives,

mp l

9 vol (k3) =

m 8

s vol(cid:0)t3(cid:1)

2

(106)

(107)

vol(t3)

2

s and mp l

we thus see, that the ir+ on the heterotic side is
, which
of course is t-duality invariant. eq.(106) agrees with the fact that
the volume of the moduli space of vacua of the heterotic 5-brane is
6 vol (k3) is the volume of the moduli space of the m
m 2
2-brane probe. we remember that scalar elds have dimension 1
2 in
3 dimensions. a concrete way of tracing the duality between these
two theories is to use t-duality from heterotic e8  e8 on t3 to
heterotic so(32) on t3, and then s-duality to type-i on t3, then
t-duality to type-ia on t3 which can be viewed as m-theory on k3.
let us now consider the decompactication to 4 dimensions. this
can be done by taking 3 = 0 and r3  . in this limit the k3
becomes elliptically bered with the ber shrinking. the area of the
ber a is

mp l

3a =

1
r3

this can be seen by noting that a membrane wrapped on the ber
corresponds to momentum around the circle r3 in the heterotic the-
ory. this limit of m-theory on an elliptically bered k3 is exactly
what gives f-theory on this k3. the m2-brane probe becomes the
d3-brane probe in f-theory on k3 [44,39]. since the volume of k3
stays xed and the ber shrinks this means that the base grows.
one might thus think that the moduli space seen by the d3-brane
probe is innite. however we should remember that a scalar eld in
4 dimensions has dimension one, so we need a factor of the type-iib

50

ij, ba

inserting this makes
string mass in the area of the moduli space.
the area is up to a constant, m 2
s . this agrees with the expectation
from sa(2) compactied on t2. we can thus summarize our result
for the 4-dimensional case. take the theory sa(2) with mass scale
ms. compactify it on a t2 with r-symmetry twists given by 1, 2.
the t2 is specied by ga
ij. the moduli space of vacua for this
n = 2 theory in d = 4 is the same as the moduli space of vacua for
the e8  e8 heterotic 5-brane wrapped on t2 with string mass, ms,
and a point in o(18, 2)/o(18)  o(2) given as follows. the metric
and 2-form on t2 is ga
ij. the wilson lines on t2 depend on
1, 2.
in the case i = 0 they are the essentially unique wilson
lines that break e8 e8 to so(8)4. for non-zero i the wilson lines
are constructed as in the last section by embedding in a diagonal
su (2)16  so(8)4.
this wrapped 5-brane in the heterotic theory is dual to the 3-
brane probe in f-theory on the corresponding elliptic-bered k3.
this k3 is the seiberg-witten curve for the moduli space. as in the
3 dimensional case, we are not saying that the compactied sa(2)
theory is equal to the little-string theory on the heterotic 5-brane,
but just that the low-energy description is the same. it is obvious
that they are not equal since the sa(2) theory has enhanced super-
symmetry when i = 0.

ij, ba

decompactifying to 5 dimensions is now easy. the correspon-
dence becomes the following. consider the theory sa(2) compacti-
ed on s1 of radius r, string scale ms and r-symmetry twist . this
is a 5 dimensional theory with n = 1 supersymmetry. the coulomb
branch is 1-dimensional. topologically it is s1/z2. this moduli space
is the same as the moduli space of the heterotic e8e8 5-brane com-
pactied on a circle with an e8  e8 wilson line. the wilson line
for one e8 is,

w = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) +

and the same for the other e8.

completely analogous statements can be made for the type-iib
5-brane theory, sb(2). here the moduli space is given by the 5-brane
in the heterotic so(32) theory. let us describe this in detail for the
case of 5 dimensions. consider sb(2) on a circle of radius r, with
r-symmetry twist  and string scale ms. the moduli space of vacua
of this is the same as the 5-brane of so(32) heterotic string theory
on a circle with radius r, string scale ms and so(32) wilson line

the string coupling  goes to zero to give a decoupled theory on the
5-brane.

there is a dual type-ia picture of the heterotic theory. the 5-
brane becomes a d4-brane living on an interval with 8-branes. the
parameters of the type-ia theory are

all quantities of interest to the d4-brane theory have a limit as  
0. the positions of the d8-branes are given by the wilson line.
at each end there are 4 d8-branes. there are two more stacks
of 4 d8-branes at distance 
2 r from each end. when  = 2 the
8-branes reach the other end. this has to be the case since  is
periodic with period 2. we also remark that something interesting
happens when  = . here 8 d8-branes are on top of each other.
we will return to a discussion of this point later. there behavior in
d = 3, 4 is similar.

fig. 7: the dual type-ia picture.

sa(2) compactied to 5 dimensions was described above by map-
ping the r-symmetry twists to e8  e8 wilson lines. for later pur-
poses it will be more convenient to use the type-ia dual description
as the theory living on a d4-brane. the chain of dualities going from
heterotic e8  e8 on s1 to type-ia is to rst invoke t-duality from
heterotic e8  e8 to heterotic so(32), and then proceed as above
to reach type-ia. the parameters of the type-ia theory in terms of
the parameters of the sa(2) theory become

we see an interesting eect here. when  = 0,  is also zero. for
small , is an increasing function. at  = msr,  reaches its
maximum and start to decrease.

the moduli spaces of all the sa(2) theories with all possible -

twists occupy some subspace

m  so(1, 17, z)\so(1, 17, ir)/so(17).

we wish to know what is the locus m which the sa(2) theories with
the t-dual -twists span. in the above chain of dualities we started
with the heterotic e8  e8 5-brane wrapped on s1. this represented
sa(2) on a circle with a -twist. by denition, sa(2) with a -twist
is t-dual to sb(2) with some -twist and therefore corresponds to a
point in the moduli space of the so(32) 5-brane. we have seen that
the points on the so(32) which correspond to our sb(2) theories
map under heterotic t-duality to the points on the e8  e8 moduli
space which correspond to the sa(2) theories. thus m and m are
the same locus. nevertheless, sa(2) with a -twist is not equivalent
to sa(2) with a -twist.

a peculiar phase transition as we have explained above, when we
compactify sb(2) with a twist  on s1 of radius r we get a 4+1d
theory whose low-energy is the same as that of a d4-brane probe
in a conguration of d8-branes on an interval. in this conguration
there are 2 stacks of four coincident d8-branes. whenever the d4-
brane crosses the stack, a particle of u (1) charge 2 (coming from the
adjoint of su (2)  u (1)) becomes massless. when the two stacks
of d8-branes coincide we get two massless hypermultiplets. since
the low-energy description of a u (1) with two massless particles is
weakly coupled, we can trust eld-theory and the conclusion is that
there exists a higgs phase where the massless hyper-multiplets get a
vev and break the u (1).

54

in the sb(2) case, this phase transition occurs for  =  and for
all values of r. in contrast, for sa(2) this only happens for small
enough r. we can see this from eq.(110). the phase transition
occurs when  =  since this is where two stacks of d8-branes
coincide in the type-ia picture. this has a real solution , only if
msr  1
4. such a bound is certainly to be expected for sa(2). the
reason is that this phase transition happens when two ns 5-branes
are on opposite points of the 11th circle. the 2 hypermultiplets that
become massless originate from membranes stretched between the
two 5-branes and wrapped on the compactied circle (the circle which
takes us from a 6-dimensional theory to a 5-dimensional theory).
the tension of the membrane gives a mass to these states. however
there is also a contribution to the mass from the zero-point energy
of the elds on the membrane. this contribution depends on . for
certain values of the parameters the zero-point energy can cancel the
mass from the tension. this is how the hypermultiplet can become
massless. obviously the mass from the tension can not be canceled
if the 11th circle is too big, or equivalently the compactied circle is
too large. this is the reason for the above inequality.

the (2, 0) limit let us briey consider another limit, namely the
limit where sa(2) on t3 becomes t (2) on t3. this happens when
the 11th circle opens up. we see from eq.(106) and eq.(107) that
vol (k3)  , i.e. the moduli space becomes non-compact. this
is as expected. basically we just get half of the k3. the other half
goes to innity. in the e8  e8 heterotic 5-brane picture it means
that the distance between the ends of the world go to innity and we
only look at one end.

field theory limits in this section we will compare the moduli spaces
of vacua found in the other sections with eld theory results. at each
point of the moduli spaces for the t (k) and s(k) theories, we can
nd a eld theory description for the light modes. we are fortunate
that such eld theories in d = 3, 4, 5 are known. the metric on
the moduli space around the chosen point will be determined by the
light matter. we are going to compare our exact metric with this
eld theory expectation.

55

let us start with sb(2) compactied on s1. the eective eld
theory is that of the d4-brane probe in type-ia. from sb(2) we have
su (2) gauge theory with (1,1) supersymmetry. (the eld content of
the (1,1) vector multiplet are a (1,0) vector multiplet and a (0,1)
adjoint hypermultiplet.) upon compactication on s1 of radius r
with a r-symmetry twist , the moduli space is parameterized by
the sixth-component of the gauge eld, a6, in u (1)  su (2). the
full r-symmetry of sb(2) theory is

so(4) = su (2)u  su (2)b

which is broken down to su (2)u by ei  u (1)  su (2)b. we
get in 5d an su (2) vector-multiplet and massive adjoint vector-
multiplets (with masses n
r with n  z6=0) transforming non-trivially
under su (2)u r-symmetry. the boundary conditions on the two
complex scalars in the adjoint hypermultiplet are shifted by :

1(2r) = ei1(0),

2(2r) = ei2(0).

(111)

this shifts the periodicity of the elds around the circle. the reduc-
tion also gives a tower of adjoint hypermultiplets in 5d with masses,

m2 =

2 )2

(n + 
r2

,

n  z.

for small  > 0, we get one light adjoint hypermultiplet of mass

2r . now let us look at the moduli space around a6 = 0. from eld
theory it looks like su (2) theory with an adjoint hypermultiplet of
mass 

2r . the gauge coupling is then given by [45],

1
g2 = b + ca6,

where b and c are constants. the slope, c, changes when charged
matter becomes massless. the change in the slope is proportional

56

to the cube of the charge of the multiplet becoming massless.
in
u (1)  su (2) an adjoint eld has components of charge 2, 0, +2
under the u(1) in units where the 2 of su (2) has charge 1. this
means that the change in the slope, c, is 8 times bigger for an adjoint
hypermultiplet than for a fundamental. let us calculate at what
value of a6 the charge 2 component of the adjoint hypermultiplet
becomes massless. the holonomy around the circle is

  e4ira6.

to cancel ei we thus need

a6 =



4r

.

let us now compare to the solution from the previous section. here
 parameterizes the position of 4 d8-branes. for  = 2 they reach
the other end of the interval. in terms of a6 the other end of the
interval is at 1

2r , so the position of the 4 d8-branes is,

a6 =


2 

1
2r

=



4r

in exact agreement. however the number of d8-branes is 4 and not
8 as naively expected from the discussion above. it seems like the
change in slope is half of what should be expected from eld theory.
there is no discrepancy for a subtle reason. we compare, on one
hand, the u(1) low energy eective action for a d4-brane moving in
an orientifold setting, with, on the other hand, a u(1) from a su (2)
gauge theory. the u(1) on the d4-brane probe corresponds not to the
u (1)  su (2) but to one of the u(1) factors in u (1) u (1)  u (2).
the action for the diagonal u (1)  u (2) is twice the action for a
single u (1) factor. the normalization would contain an extra 2
factor. taking this factor of 2 into account the change in the slope
becomes 8 instead of 4.

57

let us now consider the case of sa(2) on t3 with twists
1, 2, 3. for simplicity the torus is taken to be rectangular with
radii r1, r2, r3 with bij = 0. we will also take i to be small. we
want to nd the light elds. finding the light elds in this case is
not as easy as in the previous case, because sa(2) does not have
a lagrangian description. however we can gure out the result by
rst compactifying on a small r1, with 1 = 0. then the low energy
description is a 5-dimensional n = 2 su (2) gauge theory. in n = 1
language it comprises a vector-multiplet and a hypermultiplet. now
we can compactify this on a second circle of radius r2  r1. at scale
r2 the su (2) gauge theory is weakly coupled and we can perform a
classical analysis to include the twists 2. we get an su (2) gauge
theory in d = 4 with a hypermultiplet of mass
in d = 4,
n = 2 a hypermultiplet mass is complex. since there is no distinc-
tion between direction 1 and 2 we expect a contribution 1
from
2r1
direction 1. they have to combine into a complex mass

on compactifying down to 3 dimensions on r3 (we assume that
r3 > r2) there will similarly be a contribution 3
in d = 3
2r3
a hypermultiplet mass consists of 3 real numbers that transform in
the 3 of so(3) [43]. this so(3) is part of the r-symmetry group.
we thus conclude that the 3 real numbers are i
. there is a re-
2ri
gion in moduli space where the theory looks like n = 4, su (2) gauge
theory with an adjoint hypermultiplet with mass mi = i
. as we
2ri
have seen, this region is when |i|   and when the mass scale set
by the 2+1d sym coupling constant (the smallest of r1
and
r2r3
r3
) is much smaller than the smallest compactication scale (the
r1r2
smallest of r1
3 ). in our setting, r1  r2 < r3, this
condition is met. note that if |i|   but r1  r2  r3 are of
the same order of magnitude, the correct approximation is to start
with the 2+1d cft to which n = 8 2+1d sym ows [46,47] and
deform it by the relevant operator to which the mass deformation

ows. when mi = 0 we obtain a n = 8 theory and the moduli space
is (ir3  s1)/z2. this has two a1 singularities. when mi 6= 0 these
are blown up. from our solution in the previous section the sizes of
the blow up can be read o as a function of i. this means that
we have derived a formula for the size of the blow-up of the singu-
larities in d = 3, n = 4 su (2) gauge theory with a massive adjoint
hypermultiplet.

we can do the same analysis in d = 4. for 1 = 2 = 0
there are 4 singularities. close to any one of them the system should
be describable as an n = 2, su (2) gauge theory with an adjoint
hypermultiplet. for small i the mass of the hypermultiplet is

m =

1

2r1

+ i

2

2r2

.

we expect this to change the seiberg-witten curve. our result also
predicts how this goes. our picture is that the seiberg-witten curve
is the same as the d3-brane probe in f-theory on the k3 as described
earlier. for i = 0 this has a description as a type-iib orientifold 8
plane with 4 d7-branes on top making a d4 singularity [44,39]. for
non-zero i two of the 7-branes move away, giving a u (2) so(4) =
u (2)  su (2)  su (2) singularity.
in a eld theory setting this
corresponds to the su (2) seiberg-witten theory with 4 fundamental
hypermultiplets, 2 of them massless and 2 of them massive with equal
mass. our analysis thus predicts that this situation should have the
same curve as the massive adjoint hypermultiplet.
in the second
seiberg-witten paper [48] this was indeed found to be the case. in
comparing the curves with the low energy eective action there is
again a factor of 2 in the coupling constant  because of a dierence
in conventions between the adjoint and fundamental case. this is
the same factor of 2 as explained in the 5-dimensional case above.

59

4.4. reduction of the twisted (2, 0) theory to 4+1d

in this section we will study t (2) on s1 with a twist . neglecting
the overall center-of-mass, the moduli space is 1-dimensional. the
low-energy physics is a u (1) vector-multiplet. let  be the scalar
partner of the vector eld.
in this section we will study the bps
states in the theory. there are two dierent regions in moduli space
to consider. let r be the radius of s1. when r  1 we can use
the eective 4+1d sym lagrangian. we will show that for small ,
the bps states come from the w  bosons and the charged states of
a massive adjoint hyper-multiplet. when r  1 we can identify
the charged bps states with strings wound around s1.

the bps masses in 4+1d are [45],

2,

m0 + 2,

m0  2.

(112)

in the d4-brane and d8-brane picture, these come from strings con-
necting the d4-brane to its image, and to the two mirror d8-brane
stacks. here,

m0 =



2r

.

this can be seen from eq.(109) and eq.(110). the states with mass
2 are vectors while those with masses 2 m0 are hyper-multiplets.
yang-mills limit when  = 0, the low-energy description of t (2) on
s1 is su (2) sym with a coupling constant g2 which is proportional
to r. as long as our energy scale is below the compactication scale
r1, the coupling constant is weak and the eective description is
good. when ||  1 it can be incorporated as a small perturbation
in the eective lagrangian.
it corresponds to giving a bare mass
of m0 to the hyper-multiplet in the lagrangian. after spontaneous
breaking of su (2) down to u (1), the masses in (112) are easily calcu-
lated in eld theory. 2 is the mass of the w  bosons while 2 m0
come from the hypermultiplet. the adjoint hypermultiplet also gives
rise to a neutral multiplet with a mass m0.

60

the large-tension limit let us assume that r  1. in this case,
we can rst reduce to the 5+1d low-energy of a single n = (2, 0)
tensor multiplet and then reduce this tensor multiplet to 4+1d since
the scale of the vev  is much higher than the compactication
scale. in 4+1d, the neutral states come from the hypermultiplet in
5+1d with twists along s1 as in (111). the mass of these states is
therefore (for small ),

m =



2r

.

the charged states come from quantization of the strings wrapped on
s1. up to a correction proportional to 2
r2 (see [45,49,50]), the tension
of the string in 5+1d is  = /2r. in the limit we are considering,
r2  1, it is enough to quantize only the low-energy excitations of
the strings. this is just as well, since the low-energy excitations are
the only things we know about these strings! this means that our
results are correct up to o(1/r2). the low-energy description is
given by a 1+1d n = (4, 4) theory. the vev of the tensor multiplet
of the 5+1d bulk breaks the spin(5) r-symmetry down to spin(4).
the 1+1d low-energy description of a string contains 4 left-moving
bosons and 4 right-moving bosons, 4 left-moving fermions and 4 right-
moving fermions. the bosons are not-charged under the spin(5) r-
symmetry. the 8 fermions can be decomposed into representations,
of

(su (2)b  su (2)u  su (2)

1  su (2)

2)so(1,1)

here spin(4) = su (2)b  su (2)u is the unbroken r-symmetry of
the 5+1d theory, spin(4) = su (2)
2 is the subgroup of
spin(5, 1) of rotations transverse to the string and so(1, 1) is the
world-sheet rotation group. the fermions are in the

1  su (2)

with an added reality condition. under the embedding

u (1)  su (2)b  su (2)b  su (2)u = spin(4)  spin(5),

61

we nd 2 left-moving fermions with charge +1 under u (1), 2 left-
moving fermions with charge 1 under u (1), and 4 right-moving
fermions with charge 0 under u (1). the boundary conditions on
the charged fermions are twisted. quantization of this system gives
low-lying vector-multiplets and hyper-multiplets with masses,

r,


2r  r.

recall that the derivation assumed that r2  1 and ||  . this
agrees with eq.(112).

4.5. r-symmetry twists in the little-string theories

for the (2, 0) theories, which are believed to have a local descrip-
tion, a twist by a global symmetry along a circle makes perfect sense.
for the little-string theories, the issue of locality is more complicated
and the meaning of an r-symmetry twist has to be elaborated. in
this section we will describe the construction in more detail. we will
then see explicitly that t-duality of s(k) does not preserve the -
twists. instead it maps them to t-dual -twists. this raises the
intriguing possibility to combine both kinds of twists simultaneously.

geometrical realization one way to dene an r-symmetry twist is
to realize it geometrically as follows. we can start with ir2,1  ir3 
ir4 and mod out by a discrete z3 symmetry which is generated by
elements which act as a shift in ir3 and rotations in ir4. we obtain
z  ir2,1 where z is an ir4-bration over t3. explicitly, we dene
the 7-dimensional space

z1,2,3 = (ir3  c2)/z3,
where z3 is the freely acting group generated by,

s1 :(x1, x2, x3, z1, z2)  (x1 + 2r1, x2, x3, ei1z1, ei1z2),
s2 :(x1, x2, x3, z1, z2)  (x1, x2 + 2r2, x3, ei2z1, ei2z2),
s3 :(x1, x2, x3, z1, z2)  (x1, x2, x3 + 2r3, ei3z1, ei3z2),

(113)

62

here (x1, x2, x3) are coordinates on ir3. we can similarly dene

y1,2 = (ir2  c2)/z2,

x = (ir  c2)/z.

(114)

the theory that we study in this paper, sa(k) on t3 with a twist,
can be obtained if we compactify type-iia on z1,2,3, wrap k ns5-
branes on t3 and take s  0 as in [32]. this shows that it makes
sense to include an r-symmetry twist in s(k).

what is the meaning of these twists in terms of the theory s(k)
itself, without appealing to the underlying string-theory? let us rst
rene our terminology. let p be a generic point in the parameter
space

ma  so(3, 3, z)\o(3, 3, ir)/(o(3)  o(3)).

we will denote the theory derived from k type-iia ns5-branes at the
type-iia moduli space point p  ma by sa(k; p). similarly there
is an identical moduli space mb for type-iib ns5-branes. we will
denote the theory derived from k type-iib ns5-branes at the type-
iib moduli space point p  mb by sb(k; p). t-duality implies that
there is a map,

t : ma  mb,

with t 2 = i such that sa(k, p) = sb(k; t (p)). this map can be
dened as follows. pick an element v  o(3, 3, z) with det v = 1
(all such elements are so(3, 3, z) conjugate to each other). for g 
o(3, 3, ir) which is a representative of a point in p  ma take v  g
to be a representative of t (p)  mb.

a generic point p in the cover,

sl(3, z)\o(3, 3, ir)/(o(3)  o(3)),

of the parameter space (note that we divided by sl(3, z) instead of
so(3, 3, z)) will be called a locality-frame. a generic point p in the

63

cover,

o(3, 3, ir)/(o(3)  o(3))

will be called a coordinate-frame. there are the obvious maps,

p  p  p.

now suppose that we are in a specic point p  ma, say, and we x
a locality-frame p for p and a coordinate-frame p for p. for a given
p we can contemplate whether it makes sense to dene r-symmetry
twists along the cycles of t3. if they commute with each other, an
sl(3, z) transformation will permute the cycles and will act on the
twists in an obvious way. however, a full so(3, 3, z) transformation
takes one locality-frame to another and an r-symmetry twist is not
mapped back to an r-symmetry twist.

the t-dual of an r-symmetry twist what does become of an r-
symmetry twist after t-duality? the eect of the r-symmetry twist
is to make a state which is r-charged have a fractional momentum,
because its boundary conditions are not periodic. the momentum
modulo z is related to the r-charge and the twist in a linear way.
since t-duality replaces the momentum charge with another u (1)
charge  the winding number of little-strings, one would deduce that
after t-duality, r-charged states should have fractional winding num-
ber.

to be more precise, let us take weakly coupled type-iia on x

from (114) and perform t-duality. recall that,

x = (ir  c2)/z,

with z generated by,

s : (x, z1, z2)  (x + 2r, eiz1, eiz2).

we admit to not having checked that this is consistent with modular
invariance. the following argument suggests that turning on both
 and  twists is consistent. for small , turning on a -twists
corresponds to making a small perturbation with a certain operator
to the hamiltonian of s(k). an innitesimal -twist also corresponds
to a perturbation but with another operator. now we can make a
small perturbation with both a -twist as well as a -twist. they
preserve exactly the same supersymmetry. it could, however, happen
that after we turn on both -twists and -twists there is no longer
any super-symmetric vacuum. we do not know of any way to settle
this question.

4.6. discussion

we have argued that the moduli space of vacua of sa(2) (sb(2))
compactied on t3 with 3 r-symmetry twists, 1, 2, 3, is the same
as the moduli space of vacua of the heterotic e8 e8 (so(32)) (1, 0)
ns5-brane theory compactied on the same t3 with wilson lines
given by an embedding of the twists in the gauge group. we have
also studied how t-duality of the little-string theory acts on the
r-symmetry -twists. we have seen that they get mapped to other
types of twists (-twists). we have suggested that there exist theories
with both kinds of twists simultaneously.

let us suggest a few questions for further research:

66

1. find an m-theoretic derivation of the moduli spaces, or perhaps

using compactication on a calabi-yau manifold.

2. study the bps spectrum of the theories in 3+1d and 4+1d.
we have identied the moduli spaces of the twisted (2, 0) the-
ory with the moduli space of the compactied e8 (1, 0) the-
ory. however, these two theories are not identical. it would
be interesting to see how this distinction is manifested in the
multiplicities of bps states [51,52,53,54,55].

3. study the other phase where little-strings condense.

67

5. instantons on a non-commutative t 4 from

twisted (2,0) and little-string theories

in this chapter we will continue the study of compactied (2, 0)
and little-string theories. the main result will be that their moduli
spaces are equal to moduli spaces of instantons on noncommutative
tori, which were discussed in chapter 3.

starting with the work of [56], the moduli-spaces of vacua have
been found for a large class of gauge theories with 8 super-charges in
3+1d and in 2+1d. these solutions were derived from string duali-
ties in [38] and the works that followed. string theory also suggested
the existence of new theories in six dimensions [30,32] (see also [57-
58]). compactication of these theories to 3+1d reduces, in certain
limits of the external parameter spaces, to ordinary gauge theories.
as we will see, all the previously solved gauge theories with n = 2
supersymmetry and su (n1)su (nr) gauge groups [37] can be
recovered at special limits of the external parameters of the compact-
ication of the little-string theories. let us recall that the little-
string theory is the world-volume theory on k ns5-branes in type-iia
in the limit of vanishing string coupling keeping the string tension
xed [32]. we denote this theory sa(k). it has (2, 0) supersymme-
try. there is a similar theory coming from k ns5-branes in type-iib
in the limit of vanishing string coupling keeping the string tension
xed. we denote this theory sb(k). it has (1, 1) supersymmetry.
sa(k) and sb(k) are often referred to as the little-string theories.
they both have an inherent scale, ms. in the limit ms  , sa(k)
becomes the theory on the world-volume of k m5-branes  the so
called (2, 0) theory.

we will compactify these theories down to 3 dimensions. these
theories have 16 super-charges, so if they are compactied on t3 the
resulting theories will have n = 8 supersymmetry in three dimen-
sions. the low energy behavior of n = 8 theories is trivial. instead
we want to study theories with n = 4 supersymmetry, i.e. 8 super-
charges. so we have to compactify in a way that breaks half the su-
persymmetry. we will do that as in [59] by introducing holonomies
of the r-symmetry around the three circles in t3. to preserve half of

68

the supersymmetries the holonomies were chosen inside a su (2) sub-
group of the spin(4) r-symmetry group. the low energy behaviour
of a n = 4 theory in d = 3 is a sigma-model with the moduli-space
of vacua as the target-space. so the low energy behaviour is given
by the moduli-space of vacua and the its metric.

let us start by identifying all the parameters of the compacti-
cation. consider sa(k) compactied on t3. the scale of sa(k) is
ms, the string mass. the t3 is specied by a metric. for simplicity
we will take it to be rectangular. it is easy to incorporate the more
general case. furthermore there can be a ux of the 2-form bn s
eld of type iia through 2-cycles in the t3. for simplicity we set
bn s = 0. it is again not hard to incorporate the more general case.
now we come to the most interesting parameters  the twists. the
r-symmetry group of sa(k) is spin(4)r, corresponding to transverse
rotations. the twists are taken inside

u (1)r  su (2)b  su (2)b  su (2)u = spin(4)r

(119)

this preserves 8 of the 16 super-charges. there is a twist, i, along
each of the 3 circles. the is are periodic

i  i + 2,

i = 1, 2, 3

(120)

the twists can be described in the following way. states that are
charged under u (1)r receive a phase shift in traversing a circle. in
n 
other words, momentum along the circle is shifted from n
r .
2
by performing t-duality along all circles of the t3 we get sb(k) on
another t3. momentum has been exchanged with winding, so the
t-dual of the twists has the following description. states that are
charged under u (1)r have fractional winding numbers; n
2 instead
of n. we call this kind of twist an -twist. by combining these
two types of twists we learn that the most general twist around a
circle shifts both momentum and winding. in other words the sa(k)

r to

69

compactication on t3 depends on 6 parameters

i, i,

i = 1, 2, 3,

(121)

where i shifts momentum and i shifts winding. the is have a
clear geometrical interpretation. in traversing the circle the trans-
verse space is rotated. the is are harder to visualize. they are
geometrical in the t-dual sb(k).

we can actually generalize this system even more. instead of k
ns5-branes we can consider k ns5-branes on top of an aq1 sin-
gularity. in other words the transverse space to the ns5-branes is
ir4/zq, where zq is a subgroup of u (1)r. u (1)r is still a symme-
try of this space, so we can twist as before. these theories have
8 super-charges in 6 dimensions. the u (1)r is a global symmetry
which commutes with super-charges. the twists, therefore, do not
break any more supersymmetry, so the compactied theory still has
n = 4 in 3 dimensions.
theories of branes on top of an ade singularity have been stud-
ied in [60,61]. these 6 dimensional theories are, loosely speaking,
quiver gauge theories [62] coupled to tensor theories or vice versa,
depending on whether it is in type-iia or type-iib.

the 3 dimensional theory, obtained after compactication with
twists, has a low energy description as a sigma-model with a target-
space, which is equal to the moduli-space of vacua.
in this paper
we will prove that the moduli-space of vacua is equal to the moduli-
space of k u (q) instantons on a non-commutative t4. the non-
commutativity is set by the 6 parameters i and i. this generalizes
the case of compactication without twists where the moduli-space of
the theories turns out to be the moduli-space of ordinary instantons
[61,63].

this result implies similar results for all the theories which are
special cases of this. this includes rstly the (2, 0) theory which
can be obtained from sa(k) by ms  . secondly, it includes all
three-dimensional u (k) gauge theories with adjoint matter. by in-
corporating the aq singularity it also includes all gauge theories with

70

group u (k)u (k) and matter in (k, k, 1, . . . , 1)+permutations.
by taking the gauge coupling to zero in some u (k) we can get theories
with the gauge group being u (k) u (k) with fundamental and
bi-fundamental matter in various combinations with generic masses.
our results imply that all these 2+1d gauge theories have a
moduli-space of vacua equal to the moduli-space of vacua of instan-
tons on non-commutative ir3  s1.
in the case of mass deformed
n = 8 this result was derived earlier in [64].
space of 4 dimensional gauge theories on ir3  s1.
we also nd that for certain discrete values of the twists there are
higgs branches emanating from some locus of the coulomb branch.
we will identify these and calculate their dimensions. we will also
calculate the existence of these branches from pure eld theoretic
arguments and nd agreement in the structure of the higgs branches.
these branches generalize a branch found in [59].

by decompactifying one circle similar results hold for the moduli

moreover, combining our results with the formulas in [59] for the
special case of q = 1 and k = 2, we get a prediction for the moduli-
space of two u (1) instantons on a non-commutative t4. this is a k3
(projecting out the center of mass) and the exact point in moduli-
space was given in [59] as a function of the twists.

the organization of the chapter is as follows. in section (5.1) we
present the proof that the moduli space is equal to the moduli space of
instantons on non-commutative t4. in section (5.2) we have a short
review of the relevant aspects of non-commutative gauge theories. in
section (5.3) we use this information about non-commutative gauge
theory to make the claim about the moduli-space of non-commutative
instantons precise and discuss some features of it. in section (5.4)
we describe the decompactication limit to 3+1d (compactication
of the 5+1d theories on t2 with twists). in section (5.5) we present
a more detailed geometrical formulation of -twists and especially
-twists. we conclude with a summary of the results and possible
further direction.

71

5.1. the solution

in this section, we derive the solution to the moduli space of the
twisted theory. to construct the solution we will start with type-iia
on a space

ir2,1  t3 ~ ir4,

where ~ means that locally the space looks like ir2,1 t3 ir4 but
as we go around a cycle of the t3 we have to twist the transverse
space ir4 by the appropriate element of spin(4) corresponding to
the twist. now we take k ns5-branes and let them stretch along
ir2,1 t3 and the origin of ir4. the question what is the low-energy
eective action for this system in the limit that the type-iia string
coupling constant   0.
as will be clear later on, it is easier to solve the problem if we rst
replace the transverse ir4 with another manifold m4. in the limit
that the curvature of m4 is small at the position of the ns5-branes
the switch from ir4 to m4 will not make a big dierence. moreover,
we can argue that the quantum uctuations in the transverse position
of the ns5-brane are related to the uctuations of the scalars of sa(k)
as,

x  m3

s ,

and for energy scales ms,  is of the order of m2
s. in the limit   0,
the transverse uctuations of the ns5-brane go to zero and if the
point in m4 is smooth, it would seem that the dynamics of the ns5-
brane will be the same as on ir4. this argument should be taken
with caution since the actual solitonic solution of the ns5-brane has
a cross-section of about ms. in any case, we will not have to rely on
this argument.

the manifold m4 that we will use is the taub-nut space. the

metric is,

ds2 = 2u (dy aidxi)2 + u 1(d~x)2,

i = 1 . . . 3,

0  y  2.
(122)

72

where,

u =(cid:18)1 +



2|~x|(cid:19)1

,

and ai is the gauge eld of a monopole centered at the origin.

the taub-nut space has the following desirable properties

(these properties were also used in [65]),

(1) if we excise the origin, what remains is a circle bration over
ir3  {0}. eqn(122) is written such that ~x is the coordinate
on this base ir3  {0}. for |~x| restricted to a constant, the
bration is exactly the hopf bration of s3 over s2.

(2) the origin ~x = 0 is a smooth point.
(3) as |~x|   the radius of the ber becomes .
(4) the space has a u (1) isometry group that preserves the origin
~x = 0. an element g() = ei  u (1) acts by y  y + . it
also acts on the tangent space ir4 at the origin by embedding
ei inside

u (1)  su (2)l  (su (2)l  su (2)r)/z2 = so(4).

now that we have replaced the transverse ir4 with a taub-nut

space we have k ns5-branes on the space,

ir2,1  t3 ~ tn().

the -twists are incorporated as follows. as we go around a cycle
of t3 we have to act on the ber tn() with g(i) where i is the
appropriate twist. in the limit   , tn() becomes ir4 and the
isometry g(i) becomes the element in so(4) that we have used for
the twist. the virtue of working with tn() instead of ir4 is that
at ~x =  the circle ber becomes of nite size which will help in
subsequent dualities.

73

to generalize the construction to the case of k ns5-branes at an
aq1 singularity, ir4/zq, we replace the transverse ir4/zq with a q-
centered taub-nut space, tnq() with radius   . this space
has similar properties,
(1) if we excise the origin, what remains is a circle bration over
ir3  {0}. for |~x| restricted to a constant, the bration is is a
circle bundle over s2 with rst chern-class c1 = q.

(2) near the origin ~x = 0, tnq looks like ir4/zq.
(3) as |~x|   the radius of the ber becomes .
(4) the space has a u (1) isometry group that preserves the origin
~x = 0. an element g() = ei  u (1) acts at ~x =  by
it also acts on the tangent space ir4/zq at the
y  y + .
origin by embedding ei inside

u (1)  su (2)l  (su (2)l  su (2)r)/z2 = so(4).

note that the discrete zq by which we mod out is a subgroup
of the same u (1)  su (2)l as well.

chains of dualities

we have seen that the twisted compactied little-string theories
can be realized as follows. start with type-iia on ir2,1  t3  tnq,
where the radii of t3 are ri (of the order of ms) and the radius of
the ber of the taub-nut space is taken to be . put k ns5-branes
on ir2,1  t3 and study the limit,

  0,

ms  .

in principle, we could probably settle on a constant ms as well, since
the transverse uctuations of the ns5-brane are small. however,
the transverse size of the ns5-brane, as a solitonic object, is of the
order of m1
s . therefore, to be on the safe side, we take ms  .

74

the technique for solving theories with 8 supersymmetries is [38] to
identify a parameter that decouples from the vector-multiplet and
such that at one limit of this parameter the theory is described by
gauge theory (or little-string theory, in our case) and in another
limit a dual description becomes weakly coupled.
in that second
limit, the theory is no longer described by the gauge theory but the
vacuum structure remains the same and is determined by the classical
equations of motion. this method was also applied in [39,40,37].

in our case, to solve the problem we take the limit of strong

coupling keeping the taub-nut radius large.

  ,

ms  ,

(123)

we will also require that (ms)3  . we can think of  as be-
ing xed but very large and    much faster. we will not show
that this corresponds to a parameter that is in a hyper-multiplet
(and hence decouples from the vector-multiplets) but this is the ba-
sic assumption. recall that in 2+1d hyper-multiplets and vector-
multiplets can be distinguished with the help of the u (1)r su (2)u
symmetry which is the unbroken subgroup of (119). the scalar elds
of a vector-multiplet are invariant under su (2)u while the scalar
elds of a hyper-multiplet are in the 2 (see [43]). (the dilaton, which
is a singlet, is a quadratic expression in these elds.) similarly, the
fermions of a hyper-multiplet are invariant under su (2)u and the
fermions of a vector-multiplet are in the 2.

the next step is to use string-dualities to convert the region (123)

to a weakly coupled theory.

at this point we have k ns5-branes in type-iia on ir2,1  t3 
tnq with string coupling , string scale ms, t3-radii ri, and twists
i. for simplicity, we assume that t3 is of the form s1s1s1 with
no ns-ns 2-form uxes. since    we view this as k m5-branes
in m-theory on ir2,1 t3 s1 tnq. let mp be the 11-dimensional
planck scale. the radius of s1 is, r. they are related according to,

r =


ms

,

m 3

p =

s


.

75

the radius of tnq is, .

step 1: since, in the limit (123),

mp = ms1/3  0,

we should view the ber of the taub-nut as the 11th small dimension
and convert to type-iia on ir2,1t3s1ir3. we also have k ns5-
branes on ir2,1t3 and tnq became q d6-branes on ir2,1t3s1.
the -twists became rr 1-form wilson lines along the cycles of t3.
the string coupling constant is given by,

 = 1/2(ms)3/2  0.

the new string scale is,

m 

s = m3/2

s 1/21/2,

and the radii of t3 satisfy,

s 1/21/2ri  0.
this means that we must perform t-duality on t3.

sri = m3/2

m 

step 2: after t-duality on t3 we obtain type-iib on ir2,1ft3
s1  ir3 with radii ri which satisfy,

m 
s

ri = m3/2

1/21/2r1

i  .

there are now k ns5-branes on ir2,1ft3 and q d3-branes on ir2,1

76

s1. at this point the -twists became rr 2-form uxes,

iijk = zcjk

brr,

i, j, k = 1 . . . 3,

where cjk is the 2-cycle made out of the jth and kth directions in
t3. the string coupling is now,

(2) =



m9/2

s 3/23/2r1r2r3

= m3

s r1

1 r1

2 r1

3  .

this means that we must do s-duality.

step 3: after s-duality we get type-iib with q d3-branes and
k d5-branes in the same geometry. the string coupling constant is
now,

(3) = 1m3

sr1r2r3  0,

and the string scale is,

m (3)

s = 11/2m3

s(r1r2r3)1/2.

the radii satisfy,

m (3)

s

ri = 1/2(r1r2r3)1/2r1

i  0,

and the radius of s1 satises,

m (3)

s r = m2

s1/2(r1r2r3)1/2  .

77

at this point,

iijk = zcjk

bn sn s,

i, j, k = 1 . . . 3.

s

since m (3)
ri  0, we must perform another t-duality on t3. how-
ever, because of the ns-ns 2-form uxes, just as in [2], another
t-duality will not help. instead, let us do a t-duality on s1 which
brings us to the nal setup of gauge theory on a non-commutative
t4.

step 4: after t-duality along s1 we get type-iia with k d6-

branes and q d2-branes. the string coupling is now,

(4) =

(3)
m (3)

s r

= 1ms1/2(r1r2r3)1/2  0,

and ms = m (3)

s

. the radii satisfy,

ms ri = 1/2(r1r2r3)1/2r1

i  0,

and the radius of the s1 satises,

ms r = m2

s 1/2(r1r2r3)1/2  0.

at this point, the -twists are still ns-ns 2-form uxes. we thus
end up with a system of k d6-branes on t4  ir2,1 and q d2-branes

78

which are points on t4. the radii of t4 are given, in terms of the 3
radii ri of the original t3, as follows,

ri = m 1

branes) string scale. the nal string coupling constant is,

 = 1ms1/2(r1r2r3)1/2.

similarly, we can start with sa(k) with 3 -twists. by denition,
this is sb(k) on the dual t3 with 3 -twists. we realize this in
type-iib on the background ir2,1  t3  tnq and k ns5-branes on
ir2,1  t3. as before, the ber of the taub-nut space is denoted
by . we rst perform s-duality to replace the ns5-branes with k
d5-branes. at this point the -twists are o-diagonal components of
the metric gi9 with i in the direction of t3 and 9 in the direction of
the taub-nut ber. then, we perform t-duality on the direction of
 to obtain type-iia on ir2,1  t3  s1  ir3 with q ns5-branes on
ir2,1  t3 and k d6-branes on ir2,1  t3  s1. the -twists became
ns-ns 2-form uxes bi4 where 4 is the direction of s1. then, we
do t-duality on the three directions of t3. we obtain k d3-branes
on ir2,1  s1 and q ns5-branes. the -twists are now o-diagonal
components gi4. we then do another s-duality to get k d3-branes
and q d5-branes and, nally, another t-duality on t3. at this point
we are back with k d6-branes and q d2-branes. the -uxes are now
ns-ns 2-form uxes bi4.

the moduli space is thus the same as the moduli space of q d2-
branes inside k d6-branes on t4 with ns-ns 2-form uxes. in the
case of -twists, these uxes have both indices in the direction of
t3  t4. in the case of -twists, the uxes had one index in the

79

direction of t3 and the other index in the 4th direction. in the generic
case, we have both -twists and -twists simultaneously. the result
is that the ns-ns 2-form ux is nonzero for all 6 2-cycles of t4. the
string scale, string coupling, and the parameters of the t4 are as
calculated above. we could in principle follow the chain of dualities
above with simultaneous -twists and -twists but the intermediate
steps would involve cumbersome non-linear expressions.

the moduli space of q d2-branes inside k d6-branes on t4 with
ns-ns 2-form uxes, and in the limit that the size of the t4 vanishes,
was shown to be equivalent to the moduli space of k instantons of
u (q) gauge theory on a non-commutative t4 [66-29]. it is likely that
this result is true even for t4 of nite size, because the size decouples
by arguments as above.

in the next sections we will review the non-commutative geome-

try and formulate a precise statement about the moduli space.

5.2. review of noncommutative gauge theory

in this section we will review the elements of non-commutative

gauge theory which are relevant to our situation.

non-commutative gauge theory rst entered string theory in [2]
where it was shown to provide a matrix model for m-theory on a torus
with the c (3) eld turned on along the light-like circle. subsequently,
a lot of interesting work on this topic was done [13-67]. what we
need here is not the connection to matrix theory but just the study
of d-branes with a bn s elds turned on.

consider type-iia on ir1,9d  td with q d0-branes. the radii
of td are called ri, i = 1, .., d, the string mass ms and the coupling
. furthermore let there be a constant bn s eld along td. let

bij =zij

bn s,

i, j = 1, . . . , d

(125)

be the ux of bn s through the t2 spanned by directions i, j. the
bij are periodic with period 2 due to the gauge invariance of bn s.

80

in [68] this system was studied using the approach of [5]. the re-
sult is that the low energy physics is described by a d +1 dimensional

u (q) gauge theory on a dual torus, etd  ir0,1 with radii

and gauge coupling

(126)

(127)

the eect of bij is to change the action. every time two elds are
being multiplied, the multiplication is with the -product dened as,

((2)  (1))(x) =

,

(128)

the action is the usual gauge theory action just with this modica-
tion.

if there had been no bn s-eld the resulting d + 1 dimensional
gauge theory could have been obtained by performing t-duality along
td. the q d0-branes would have turned into q dd-branes. the radii
and gauge coupling of the u (q) theory can be calculated in this way.
the important point to remember is that the only change from having
a bn s-eld is to change the product into eq.(128). the radii and
gauge coupling are independent of bij. this result could not have
been obtained by t-duality, since bn s-elds change the formulas of
t-duality and would have given other radii and gauge coupling.

81

there is another way of formulating this gauge theory. instead
of working with the -product, eq.(128), one can say that the torus
is generated by u1, . . . , ud with relations

etd is non-commutative. the algebra of functions on the torus is,a,

uiuj = ujuieibij

(129)

the generalization of nite dimensional vector elds is nitely gen-
erated projective modules over a. let e be such a module. one can
dene connections,, and curvature fij of this module [2,29]. one
can dene the chern character of the module e

ch(e) =xk=0

 (f k)
(2i)kk!

(130)

 is the trace on enda(e). ch(e) can be regarded as an element
in the cohomology, h (td, c), of td, the original torus. ch(e) is
not integral but there exists an integral cohomology class (e) 
h (td, c) such that

ch(e) = e

1

2 (b)(e)

(131)

here (b) denotes contraction with b considered as an element of
h(td, c) [29].

the mathematical fact that the module e is characterized by
integers is in exact agreement with our expectation from d-brane
physics. besides the q d0-branes on td there could be any number
of d2-branes, d4-branes , etc. wrapped on td. these numbers
are exactly given by (e). ch(e) measures the fact that d2-branes
with bn s-elds turned on have an eective d0-brane charge and the

82

equivalent phenomena for other branes. suppose for instance that
only 0 and 1 are nonzero, then,

ch0 = 0 +

b12
2

1,

ch1 = 1.

(132)

this equation reects the fact that the number of d2-branes is un-
changed by the presence of the bn s-eld but the number of d0-
branes is shifted by the product of the number of d2-branes and the
bn s-eld along the d2-branes.

5.3. noncommutative instantons as the moduli-space

let us now go back to our system of q d2-branes inside k d6-
branes given above. they have a common ir1,2. this is the space-
time in which the 3 dimensional theory is living. the 3 dimensional
theory has a low energy description as a sigma model with the moduli
space of vacua as target space. the moduli space of vacua is a hyper-
kahler manifold. the moduli space of vacua comes from the dynamics
on the t4, which is the same as the dynamics of q d0-branes in k
d4-branes on t4. the radii of the t4, r1, r2, r3, r4, and the string
coupling  and string scale ms are given in terms of the parameters
of the sa(k) compactication in (124) which we repeat here,

but the vacuum structure of the vector-multiplets should be inde-
pendent of  in this limit.

according to the above review of non-commutative geometry,
the moduli space is equal to the moduli space of k instantons in

what about the limit    and ms xed. to see that the
moduli space of vacua is well dened in this limit we should remember
that scalar elds in three dimensions have dimension 1
2, if we want a
standard kinetic term. we can either view the moduli space of vacua
from the u (q) gauge theory point of view or from the u (k) theory
on the d2-branes. from the last point of view the moduli space is
the higgs branch. the action of the u (k) theory has a term,

we see that the limit    exists. this last discussion was really
superuous. since sa(k) only depends on the combination m2
s and
does not feel , this had to be true. for nite ms, it could even
be true for the full theory, not just the moduli space of vacua. the
eect of the twists is just to deform the moduli space and so does
not change the fact that the moduli space is independent of  and
has a limit when   , keeping ms xed.
we can also see from (140) what happens in the limit of the
(2, 0) theory. for this limit we take ms  . we nd that the t4
degenerates to t3  ir.

85

let us now be more precise about the space of instantons on a
non-commutative t4. for this sake we will temporarily neglect the
uncompactied directions and think of our system as q d0-branes and
k d4-branes on t4. according to the review of non-commutative ge-

ometry above, this is described by a gauge theory on the dual et4

with non-commutativity parameters, bij, equal to the twists. by
gauge theory we really mean a projective module, e, which is char-
acterized by

(e) = h (t4, z).

(141)

(e) has components in dimensions 0,2 and 4. 0 = q is the number
of d0-branes on t4. (1)ij is the number of d2-branes in the t2
in direction (i, j) with i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4. 2 = k is the number of d4-
branes. so far we have not specied the number of d2-branes. since
we are interested in the low energy dynamics we should take the
number of d2-branes to minimize the total energy in the d0,d2,d4
brane system. when bij = 0 this is done by setting 1 = 0, i.e. no
d2-branes. let us turn on b12, say. from the formula

ch(e) = e

1

2 (b)(e)

we get

(ch1)34 = (1)34 +

b12
2

2 = (1)34 +

b12
2

k.

(142)

(143)

to minimize the energy, (ch1)34 should be minimized. we see that
when b12 > 1
2k 2 we can lower the energy by taking (1)34 = 1.
this phenomena divides the space of bij into brillouin zones. each
zone is a six dimensional cube of length 2
k in each direction. inside
a zone the low energy physics is described by the gauge theory cor-
responding to a module with the (e) which minimizes the energy.
in crossing the boundary between 2 zones, (e) jumps.

we also see another interesting phenomena. whenever b12

2 k is an
2 and hence (ch1)34 = 0. this means

integer we have (1)34 =  b12

86

that ch(e) is nonzero only in dimensions 0 and 4 (we are keeping
all other components of bij = 0. only b12 = n 2
k ). this is exactly
like the pure d0,d4 system with no bn s-eld. this system has a
phase where the d0-branes and d4-branes are separated. to reach
this phase the system has to go through zero-size instantons. we
thus conclude that whenever b12 = n 2
k ,n  z there is another phase.
of course, there is nothing special about b12. similar statements
could be made for the other 5 components of bij and even for all
of them simultaneously. the point is that for each center of the
brillouin zone there is another branch emanating from a locus on
the coulomb branch. it emanates from the points on the coulomb
branch where some instantons have shrunk to zero size. the other
phase consists of the k d4-branes with n d2-branes inside moving
away from the q d0-branes. let us calculate the dimension of this
branch. suppose rst n = 1, so there are k d4-branes with 1 d2-
brane inside (equivalently 1 anti d2-brane). this system has a bound
state. it is not marginally bound. the system has an 8 dimensional
moduli space. to see this we should really remember that it is really
k d6-branes with 1 d4-brane. 4 of the dimensions are u (1) wilson
lines on the t4. they are center of mass coordinates and are always
present. we are not interested in these. the other 4 are 3 transverse
positions and the dual photon in 3 dimensions. we conclude that
the other phase is 4 dimensional. furthermore it emanates from a
point on the coulomb branch, since all instantons have to shrink on
top of each other. the only freedom is the point where they shrink,
but that is a center of mass degree of freedom which we ignore.

let us now take n to be generic. let g = gcd(n, k). the system
of n d2-branes inside k d4-branes can split into g separate systems.
the dimension is thus 8g  4, subtracting the center of mass again.
it emanates from the coulomb branch on a locus of dimension 4g4.
the special case of q = 1, k = 2 was studied in detail in [59].
here it was found that there was another phase of dimension 4 for
 = . we see that this agrees exactly with what was found here.
however we get a much clearer picture of the other branch. in the
next section we will understand these branches from a eld theory
point of view.

phase transitions from the gauge theory with generic twists (non-

87

commutativity parameters), the moduli-space that we obtain is
smooth. however, for special values of the twists the moduli space
has ade-type singularities. we would now like to explain the origin
of some of these singularities.

sb(k) is a gauge theory at low energies. let us study it with an
-twist along one circle and no twist along the other 2 circles. since
there is a circle without twist we can t-dualize on that direction
to sa(k), so these remarks apply to sa(k) as well. we want to
reproduce the existence of other branches of the moduli space. for
a related discussion see [69].

the elds in 6 dimensions are a u (k) vector-multiplet and an
adjoint hypermultiplet.
in 3 dimensions there is a tower of u (k)
vector-multiplets with masses ( n1
), ni  z and a tower of
r1
adjoint hypermultiplets with masses ( n1 
), ni  z. we
r1
remember that a mass in n = 4 theories in 3 dimensions is specied
by 3 numbers. the moduli space is 4k-dimensional including the
center of mass degrees of freedom. on the coulomb branch the
u (k) is broken to u (1)k. each adjoint hypermultiplet splits into k2
hypermultiplets of the following charges. there are hypermultiplets
with charge (0, . . . , 0), and there are k hypermultiplets with charges
(1,1, . . . , 0) plus permutations. there is a total of k(k1) of these.
some of these hypermultiplets can become massless on the coulomb
branch. for that to happen we have to turn on a wilson line, a1,
along the rst circle and set the other 3k moduli zero. a1 has the
form

the tower of hypermultiplets is now as follows. there are k of charge

(145)

now it is easy to make some of them massless by choosing a1 appro-
priately. however to have a higgs branch we need to have non trivial
solutions to the d-atness equations. for hypermultiplets charged
under a u (1)r group there should be at least r + 1 of them to have
a non trivial solution. we thus need to nd a number of massless
hypermultiplets which is bigger than the number of u (1)s under
which they are charged. no hypermultiplets are charged under the
diagonal u (1). let us rst nd a situation of k massless hypermulti-
plets which are charged under u (1)k1. the hypermultiplet of charge
(1,1, 0, . . . , 0) is massless if,

n1 = 0,

a1  a2 = .

the one of charge (0, 1,1, 0, . . . , 0) is massless if,

n1 = 0,

a2  a3 = 

(146)

(147)

and so on, up to the multiplet of charge (0, . . . , 0, 1,1) which is
massless if,

n1 = 0,

ak1  ak = 

(148)

this gives k 1 massless hypermultiplets. to have one more we need

89

(1, 0, . . . , 0, 1) to be massless. this is the case if,

for some integer n1. now,

ak  a1 = (ak  ak1) + . . . + (a2  a1) = (k  1)

2 to be an integer. so for  = 2

so we need k
k we have another phase
of dimension 4. the dimension is 4 because there are k massless
hypermultiplets each having 4 scalar elds and the d-atness con-
ditions remove 4(k  1) dimensions leaving 4 real dimensions. this
phase agree agrees exactly with the exact result from the previous
section. we thus see that a naive eld theory treatment, keeping
all kaluza-klein modes, reproduces the result. this phase emanates
from the coulomb branch whenever ai = ai1 =  as we saw above.
this xes the ai up to an overall shift. the overall shift is the u (1)
part which we discard anyway. this shows that the other phase em-
anates from one particular point on the coulomb branch. note that
the eld theory treatment is justied when msri  1.

more generally, let us take  = n 2

k

g . we thus get g sets of k

k and g = gcd(n, k). now we
can play the same game as above but within g blocks of the u (k)
matrix of size k
g massless elds. each set
g 1 subgroup. this gives a 4g dimensional
is charged under a u (1)
phase emanating from a locus on the coulomb branch. this locus
has dimension 4g  4. the 4g comes from the diagonal u (1) in each
of the g blocks. the center of mass is subtracted again. this branch
has a total dimension of 4g+4g4 = 8g4. we again nd agreement
with the exact result described previously.
the branches described above are the only ones coming from the
naive eld theory description besides the cases  = 2n, n  z which
behave like  = 0.

5.4. the 3+1d limit

in this section we will explain how to obtain the 3+1d seiberg-
witten curves of the various theories compactied on t2 with a twist.
this time we only have two independent -twists corresponding to
the two cycles of t2. the way to obtain the 3+1d sw curves is to
start with the moduli space of the theory compactied on t2  s1
where s1 is of radius r and take the limit r  . let the 2+1d
hyper-kahler moduli space be of dimension 4n. in the limit r  ,
it can be written as a bration of t 2n over a base of dimension 2n. in
the decompactication limit the ber t 2n shrinks to zero. we inter-
pret it as the jacobian variety of a riemann surface of genus n which
varies over the base. this will then be the seiberg-witten curve (see
[43]). starting with the blum-intriligator little-string theories of k
ns5-branes at an aq1 singularity compactied on t2 with twists
we can get, in appropriate limits, a 3+1d gauge theory with,

su (k)1    su (k)q,

and massive adjoint hyper-multiplets in consecutive (k, k) representa-
tions. the seiberg-witten curves for these models have been derived
in [37]. as we will show below, we can reproduce these curves by
taking the appropriate decompactication limit of the moduli space
of k u (q) instantons on the non-commutative t4.

to start, we will recall how the reduction of the untwisted com-

pactied blum-intriligator theories works.

from instantons to quiver gauge theories when we set all the -
twists to zero we obtain the statement that the coulomb-branch
moduli space of the theories of k ns5-branes on an aq1 singularity,
compactied on t3 is the same as the moduli space of k ordinary
instantons with a u (q) gauge group on t4. this result has already
been established in [61,63]. suppose we compactied on t3 = t2s1
and take the radius of s1, r  . it can be checked (see (140))
that the auxiliary t4 becomes a product t2
f . the complex

b  t2

91

f and t2

b is proportional to r and the area of t2

structure of t2
b are xed as r   while the area of
t2
f is proportional to
r1. now take a particular gauge conguration corresponding to
an instanton of u (q) with instanton number k. we can encode the
information in the instanton as follows (see [70,71]). at a local point
on the base, the gauge eld reduces to two commuting u (q) wilson
lines on the ber. we can describe them uniquely as q points on

the dual et2 of the ber. these q points vary over the base b. the

instanton equations imply that they span a holomorphic curve g of
genus g = qk + 1. g is called the spectral curve. to completely
describe the instanton we also need to describe a line bundle over
g which corresponds to a point in the jacobian of g (recall that
the jacobian of a genus g curve is t g). the line bundle is called the
spectral-bundle. alternatively, we can represent the moduli space
of u (q) instantons at instanton number k on b  f as the moduli
space of q d6-branes wrapped on bf with k d2-branes. the curves
are obtained by t-duality along the two directions of f . we obtain
a d4-brane wrapped on a curve g of homology cycle q[b] + k[f ].
the curve g is the seiberg-witten curve of the point in the moduli
space. it intersects a generic ber f in q points and a zero section
of the base b at k points. it is also easy to see that as the base b
decompacties to s1  ir1 we reproduce exactly the curves from the
brane construction of [37] for the quiver gauge theory.

the role of the non-commutativity now let us repeat the same pro-
cedure but with two non-commutativity parameters 1 and 2. we
can take 1 to be along the rst cycle of the base b = t2 and the
rst cycle of the ber f = t2 and we take 2 to be along the second
cycle of the base b and the rst cycle of the ber f . the -twists will
similarly correspond to non-commutativity along the second cycle of
b and one of the two cycles of f .

to translate this to the curve g we take the system of q d6-
branes and k d2-branes and put in nsns 2-form uxes according
to the non-commutativity parameters. after t-duality along f the
nsns uxes become components of the metric gij .

as a result, we obtain a tilted t4  ir4/, where  is a lattice

92

spanned by the following vectors:

e1 = (1, 0, 0, 0),
e2 = (1, 2, 0, 0),
e3 = (1 + 11, 12, , 0),
e4 = (2 + 22, 22, 1, 2).

(151)

here,   1 + i2 is the complex structure of t2
the complex structure of t2

b, and,

f ,   1 + i2 is

 = ms(22)1,

so that the overall volume of the unit cell will be m2
s. we will denote
the coordinates in ir4 by (x1, x2, x3, x4). the d2 and d6 branes
became a single d4-brane in the homology class,

[] = q[b] + k[f ].

here,

f   {se1 + te2 | 0  s, t  2},
b  {se3 + te4 | 0  s, t  2}.

(152)

are two faces of t4. similarly to [37] the d4-brane will nd a
minimal-area surface in this homology class. in the complex struc-
ture given by,

z = x1 + ix2,

w = x3 + ix4,

the cohomology class   h 2(z) which is poincar`e dual to [] will,
generically, be a mixture of (1, 1), (0, 2) and (2, 0) forms. however,

93

it is always possible to nd a complex structure (with respect to the
at metric) for which  is entirely a (1, 1) form.
in this complex
structure the t4 is algebraic (see p315 of [72]). given the complex
structure, it is possible to write down the curve  as the zero locus
of a -function on t4. these -functions are the sections of the line-
bundle corresponding to [] and depend on kq parameters which are
the moduli (see [72] for further details).

it is easy to see that the elliptic-models of [37] are recovered in
the special limit in which we get a gauge theory with massive hyper-
multiplets. in this case    and there are no -twists. the ber
f  is replaced with a strip s1  ir1. the class [] is analytic (i.e.
the class  is a (1, 1) 2-form) and the seiberg-witten curves of [37]
are recovered.

5.5. another look at the -twists

in this section, we write explicitly the solution for type-iia (or
type-iib) theory, with both -twists and -twists turned on. these
solutions should be interpreted as string world-sheet -models with
a b-eld.

we will start with a taub-nut space without ns5-branes. it
is straightforward to dene the -twist. one starts with some given
background, which is a principal u (1) bundle cross a torus td. lo-
cally, the -twist is just the change of coordinate in the s1 ber of the

taub-nut space, of the form y  y +p i i . y is the coordinate

on the circle (see (122)) and i is the coordinate on t3 (i = 1, 2, 3).
since it is just the change of variables, the string theory equations
of motion are trivially satised. but globally, this is not a valid co-
ordinate transformation, since i i is not a periodic function on t3
modulo 2. therefore, we get a dierent background  we call it the
-twisted background. as for -twists, they are related to -twists
by t duality in t3.

we will construct the background with both  and  twists
turned on in the following way. we rst consider the background
containing taub-nut space cross a three-torus, without any twists.
we introduce -twists along the three-torus, with the parameters i.

94

then, we make a t-duality transformation, and get a background
with -twists. this new background is again a u (1) bundle cross a
(dual) torus, and we now -twist it. in this way, we get a background
with both -twists and -twists.

let us do it explicitly. start with ir1,2tn()t3. the metric

is:

where we have denoted

ds2 =2u[](|~r|)a2 + u[](|~r|)1(d~r)2
1 + dx2
2,

0 + dx2

+ gij didj  dx2
u[](|~r|) (cid:18)1 +



2|~r|(cid:19)1

(153)

(154)

and a is the connection one-form a = dy  ~a  d~r. also, we turn on
the following b eld:

b = bij di  dj

(155)

we wish to introduce -twists with the parameter i. as was ex-
plained above, this means just the change of variables y  yi di.
this amounts to replacing a2 with (a  idi)2 in (153).
now we make three t-dualities. we do this by the standard tech-
  i (where  is a string world-sheet coordi-
nique of treating v i
nate) as an independent variable and inserting a lagrange multiplier,

ei, for, [v i

ds2 =

]. we get the following metric:
2u[](|~r|)

0 + dx2

(a  bij idej )2 + u[](|~r|)1(d~r)2
2u[](|~r|)

ij! deidej

(156)

95

with the notation, i = gij j , (, ) = ii, and gij + bij is the
matrix inverse to gij + bij . also, we have the following b eld:

b =  2u[](|~r|)

notice that

1+2(,)u[](|~r|)idei  (a  bj kj dek) + bij dei  dej

(158)

1 + (, )2 uh



1+(,)2i(|~r|)

1 + (, )2u[](|~r|)

if we start with a non-degenerate torus and a very small coupling
constant, then t-duality gives us back a very small coupling constant.
now we -twist this background. again, -twisting is just a

replacement,

a  a  idei ,

in all the formulas for the metric and the b eld. it is convenient to

absorb bij idej into idei . then, the background elds are:

where

+ (dx)2 + l4

sgij (|~r|)deidej ,

ds2 =r2(|~r|)(a  i dei)2 + u[](|~r|)(d~r)2

2u[](|~r|)

1+(,)2u[](|~r|) ij

1+(,)2u[](|~r|)

= bij

2u[](|~r|)

2u[](|~r|)

(159)

(160)

also, the dilaton is not constant. let  be the string coupling at

96

|~r|  . then, the string coupling at nite |~r| is:

(|~r|) = s 1 + 22

1 + 22u[](|~r|)

(161)

the metric (159) is not, strictly speaking, hyper-kahler. indeed,
although it does have three complex structures, they are not covari-
antly constant with respect to the standard covariant derivative. but
they must be covariantly constant, if we modify 
 with the torsion,
proportional to h = db.

we want to study the moduli space of the theory on the ns5-
brane, sitting at ~r = 0 in this background. as we remarked in section
(2), the ns5-brane has a size of ls and, although it is very heavy, it
could aect the metric. we will explore this later in this section.
for now, we will assume that it is safe to forget about the ns5-
brane. to study the moduli space, we perform the chain of dualities.
it is most convenient to think of these dualities as acting on the
asymptotic (|~r|  ) values of the elds. therefore, we would like
to discuss how the background elds near the position of the ns5-
brane (|~r|  0) are related to the asymptotic values of the elds at
|~r|  .

let us look rst at the geometry near the origin in ir3. from
(156) and (158) we see that the geometry becomes at when the
following two conditions are satised:

|~r|  

and

|~r| 



1 + (, )2

(162)

in this limit, we have just ir1,6  t3 with the metric

ds2 = (dx)2 + |d(eijej z1)|2 + |d(eijej z2)|2 + gij deidej (163)

97

the b eld becomes:

b = i dei  im(z

1dz1 + z

2dz2) + bij dei  dej

(164)

we wish to study the moduli space for the ns ve-brane sitting at
~r = 0. notice that the transversal uctuations of this ve-brane at
energy scale  m2
s have the characteristic size x  ls. if we
take   ls and general , then both of the inequalities (162) are
satised for |~r|  x. this suggests that the parameter   ls
actually does not aect the moduli space. the reason why it might
be not true is that the transversal size of the ns5-brane is, actually,
of the order ls. therefore the curvature of the background should,
presumably, aect the physics even in the limit   0. the answer
we will get shows that the moduli space does not really depend on .

now let us look at the elds at innity. they are given by the
formulae (159) and (160) with |~r| = . we will denote the limits of
r2(|~r|), gij (|~r|) and bi(|~r|) as |~r|   by r2, gij and bi. it is
convenient to have a dictionary relating the elds at |~r| =  with
the elds at |~r| = 0. let us rst summarize our notations. we have
already introduced the matrices gij , bij , gij and bij satisfying:

(gij + m2

sbij )(gj k + l2

sbj k) = i
k

we have also introduced gij and bij in (159). now, we dene gij ,
bij , g1

ij in the following way:

ij and g1

(gij + bij )(gj k + bj k) = k
i ,

ij gj k = k
i
(165)
then, we have the following dictionary, relating asymptotic back-

g1
ij gj k = k

i , g1

98

ground to the local background:

2 = r2 + (b, b),
gij = gij + r2bibj ,

r2 = 2 + (, ),
g1
ij + 2ij ,

ij = g1

i =

r2g1

ij bj

1 + r2(b, b)

,

bi =

2

1 + 2(, )

gij j ,

(166)

bij = bij .

the local value, 0, of the string coupling is related to the asymptotic
value  by the formula which follows from (161):

2
0 = (1 + (, )2)2

(167)

the chain of dualities.

we start by replacing the taub-nut circle with the m-theory
circle. we get a d6-brane wrapped on t4, with the ns5-brane on
top of it.

at this point it is useful that we remember how the elds of
type-iia theory are related to the elds of m-theory. m-theory on
a u (1) bundle is type-iia on the base of this bundle. suppose that
the action of u (1) is associated to the vector eld v. the m-theory
three-form cm splits as follows:

cm = a(3) + a  b

(168)

also, we choose some local trivialization, and dene the connection
one-form a(1) on the base, da(1) = f (f is the curvature two-form
on the base, da = f ). it should be identied with the rr one-
form c (1) of type-iia. also, b should be identied with the b eld
of type-iia (this follows from its coupling to the fundamental string).

99

what is the relation between a(3) and the ramond-ramond three-
form c (3) of type-iia? let us remember the general formula for the
couplings of the ramond-ramond elds to the d-brane [66]:

srr =z pc  tref b

for example, for the d2 brane we get:

srr = 2z c (3)  c (1)  (b  f )

(169)

(170)

here c (1) should be identied with the connection one-form, a =
d + c (1). we have to keep in mind that various forms participating
in this formula are, in general, subject to gauge transformations. for
example, under the gauge transformation c (1)  c (1)d we should
have c (3)  c (3)  d  b (this is needed for the coupling (170) to
be correctly dened). this suggests that

c (3) = a(3) + c (1)  b

(171)

(that is, cm = c (3) + d  b.) we may derive how ramond-
ramond elds transform under t duality from their coupling to d
branes. it follows that ceb transforms as a spinor of o(d, d, z).
notice that

ceb = a(1) + a(3) + forms of higher rank.

(172)

let us return to our dualities. we assume that the m theory
circle in our original conguration has radius s = ls, where ls is the
string scale in the conguration we start with, and  is the original
coupling constant (which has to be very small, if we want to get

100

little string theory on ns5 brane). the three-form of m theory is
read from (159):

cm = (a  i dei)  bj dej  d + bij dei  dej  d

if we now treat the taub-nut circle as the m-theory circle, we get
(168) with

(173)

a(3) = bij dei  dej  d,

b = bidei  d.

(notice that a  idei is just the connection 1-form after -twist.)

in the new type-iia theory, obtained by compactifying m theory
on the taub-nut circle, we have the following asymptotic values of
the background elds:

(174)

ds2 = s2d2 + l4

sgij deidej + d~r2 + (dx)2,

b = bi dei  d,
ceb = i dei + d  bij dei  dej .

(we have used (172) to nd ceb in type-iia.) the new string length
is:

l2
1 =

s
r

l2
s = 0

l3
s


and the new string coupling constant is:

1 =(cid:18) r

ls(cid:19)3/2 1


101

(175)

(176)

making three t duality transformations along t3, we get:

ds2 =

l2
s2
0

2 h2d2 + g1

+ d~r2 + (dx)2

ij di dj + 2g1

ij bidj di

brr =iij kdj  dk + d  ij kbij dk
bn s =0

with the string coupling constant,

2 =



sdet g
l3

.

(177)

(178)

the ns5-brane remains an ns5-brane, wrapped on t3, and d6-brane
becomes d3-brane. it shares with ns5 the directions of ir1,2.

now we do s-duality, so that brr becomes bn s, and ns5 be-
comes d5. also, we get the new string coupling and the new string
length:

sdet g
l3

3 =

l3 = 0s(det g1

(179)

then, doing t-duality along the circle parameterized by . we
have now d6 brane wrapped on the four-torus, and the d2 brane
inside it, orthogonal to the torus. we end up with the following
string coupling and string length,

4 =

(181)
let us summarize. we have started with k ns5-branes sitting at
the center of the taub-nut space, string coupling 0 and string
length ls. the background elds are given by the equations (163)
and (164), they correspond to both -twists and -twists present.
by the chain of dualities, we have mapped this conguration to k d6
branes wrapped on t4, and one d2 brane, the metric and the b eld
given by (180) and (181). notice that the volume of t4 is l2
4. in
the limit we are interested in (0  0) it remains nite in the string
units (specied by l4). the shape of the torus does not depend on .
world-sheet t-duality in the limit    let us now see what
happens in the limit   . the strategy will be to start with
type-iia string-theory on the purely geometrical background which
realizes the -twist. we will then perform world-sheet t-duality on
s1 to obtain a nonlinear world-sheet -model. finally, we will insert
the ns5-branes back.

2 l4

s

to describe the geometrical background we choose,

x6, . . . , x9,

as the transverse coordinates (on which the r-symmetry so(4) acts).
these replace the coordinates y and ~r of tn(). we will denote,

z1 = x6 + ix7,

z2 = x8  ix9.

the other coordinates will be denoted,

x0 . . . x5,

where x5 is periodic with period 2. they are the world-sheet elds
corresponding to x0, x1, x2, 1, 2, 3 from the previous section. the

103

bosonic part of the world-sheet action is,

l0 =

4x,=0

xx + r2x5x5 + xi=1,2

zizi.

let us, for simplicity, twist only along x5 (= 3). the twist implies
that zi are not single-valued but rather,

wi = ziei 

2 x5,

i = 1, 2

are single-valued. the world-sheet lagrangian now reads,

l0 =

xx + r2x5x5

|wj +

wjx5|2.

(182)

4x,=0
+ xj=1,2

next we perform t-duality by the standard technique of treating
v  x5 as an independent eld and inserting a lagrange multi-
plier y for [v].

the result is a world-sheet action corresponding to the metric

and b-eld,

ds2 =

adding in the ns5-brane now we repeat the same excercise with
the ns5-brane metric. in string units, the metric is,

l0 =

(184)

the dilaton is given by,

and the solution is to be trusted when gs  1. (see discussion in
[73].) after t-duality we obtain,

this is to be trusted when,

we see that as r  0, the y -direction stays of nite size 2
 .

105

large radius limit an interesting question is what is the low-energy
description of sb(k) compactied on s1 of radius r with a xed -
twist in the limit r  . naively, one can argue as follows. to
perform an -twist we have to go over the fundamental degrees of
freedom of sb(k) (whatever they are!) and separate them accord-
ing to their charge q under the u (1) subgroup of the r-symmetry
and according to their momenta n and winding w along s1. we
then add qr to the mass of this eld. in the limit r   and
for generic , this will push all the q-charged elds to high energy
and we will be left with only the q-neutral sector. thus, if we start
with n = (1, 1) u (k) sym in 5+1d, as the eective low-energy de-
scription, the conclusion would be that we are left with n = (1, 0)
u (k) sym. this conclusion cannot be correct since the gluinos of
the n = (1, 0) vector-multiplet are chiral and the theory has a local
gauge anomaly.
one possibility is that there is no 5+1d limit. for this to be
true we must show that there are no bps states corresponding to
light kk states. on the type-iia side we must show that there are
no states made by strings wrapped on the t-dual s1 which would
become light. perhaps, when the circle is small enough, they do not
form bound states any more?

5.6. conclusion

let us summarize the results:
1. the moduli space of the little-string theories of k ns5-branes
compactied on t3 with spin(4) r-symmetry -twists is equal
to the moduli space of k u (1) instantons on a non-commutative
t4. the shape of the t4 is determined by the shape and size of
the physical t3 and by the nsns 2-form uxes along it. the
non-commutativity parameters are determined from the values
of the twists.

2. in principle, there are 6 non-commutativity parameters on t4.
they are determined from the 3 geometrical -twists and the
3 non-geometrical -twists. the moduli space depends only on
the 3 self-dual combinations of the non-commutativity param-
eters and hence only on the sum of the -twists and -twists.

106

3. combining the result for k = 2 with the result of [59], we obtain
a concrete prediction for the moduli space of 2 u (1) instantons
on a non-commutative t4. this 8-dimensional moduli space is
a resolution of (t4  t4)/z2 by blowing up the singular locus.
it can also be described as a t4 bration over a z4
2 quotient
of a particular k3. the ber corresponds to the center-of-
mass of the ns5-branes and the structure group is z4
2 acting
as translations of the ber. the particular point in the moduli
space of hyper-kahler metrics on the k3 was constructed in
[59] as a function of the -twists, i.e. the non-commutativity
parameters. this k3 turns out to have a z4
2 isometry. the
k3 can be described by blowing up t4/z2 and the z4
2 acts by
permuting the exceptional divisors of the blow-up. note that
this z4

2 does not act freely.

4. similarly, the moduli space of the little-string theories of [61] of
k ns5-branes at an aq1 singularity, compactied on t3 with
-twists (twists in the global u (1)), is equal to the moduli
space of k u (q) instantons on a non-commutative t4.

5. we studied the phase transitions which occur at singular points

of the moduli space.

6. if instead of the little-string theories we start with the (2, 0)
theory (or the scft theory of [60] in item (4) above), we obtain
the moduli spaces of instantons on a non-commutative t3 ir.
the non-commutativity parameters are only along t3, which
is in accord with the fact that there are no -twists for this
problem.

let us conclude with 3 open problems:

a. generalize to other gauge groups, in particular to d-type and

e-type little-string theories.

b. generalize to ns5-branes at d-type or e-type singularities.

c. study the -twists, in particular how they are described at large

compactication radii.
