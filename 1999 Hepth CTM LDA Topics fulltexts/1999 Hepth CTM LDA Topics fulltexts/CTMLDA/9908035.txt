(a.12) easy introduce third matrix a3 establish lower bound simulta- neous null eigenvectors three matrices. idea consider maximum number simultaneous null eigenvectors a1 a2 non-null eigenvectors a3. null eigenvectors form v(q) eq, number bounded min(cid:0)xq, xq+r3, . . . , xq+(p/c31)r3(cid:1) . (a.13) 28 hence lower bound number simultaneous null eigenvectors a1, a2 a3 form v(q) eq given max(cid:0)0, xq xq+r3, . . . , xq xq+(p/c31)r3(cid:1) . (a.14) establishes lower bound number simultaneous null eigenvectors three matrices. stringent bound obtained considering three permutations line reasoning. putting together, one nds lower bound max(cid:0)d(ra, q) d(ra, q + nbrb) d(ra, q + ncrc) + d(ra, q + nbrb + ncrc)(cid:1) (a.15) number simultaneous null eigenvectors, a, b, c run 6 permutations 1, 2, 3, integers na = 0, . . . , p/ca 1. using equations (4.4) ab reality condition (3.6), last equation (4.4) written 1212 + 1313 + 1414 = 1 4(w 0)1 . (a.16) 12, 13 14 simultaneous null eigenvector solution equation since w 0 non-degenerate (a.15), r1 = q1 + q2, r2 = q1 + q3 r3 = q1 + q4, gives lower bound number null eigenvectors; hence solution (a.16) exist, necessary q permutation a, b, c d(ra, q) d(ra, q + nbrb) d(ra, q + ncrc) + d(ra, q + nbrb + ncrc) 0 . (a.17) way set inequalities satised d(ra, q + ncrc) d(ra, q + nbrb + ncrc) independent nc requires kq equal. qed.
