abstract

i discuss some issues of perturbative quantum gravity, namely of a theory of
self-interacting massless spin-2 quantum gauge elds, the gravitons, on at
space-time, in the framework of causal perturbation theory. the central
aspects of this approach lie in the construction of the scattering matrix by
means of causality and poincare covariance and in the analysis of the gauge
structure of the theory. for this purpose, two main tools will be used: the
epsteinglaser inductive and causal construction of the perturbation series
for the scattering matrix and the concept of perturbative operator quantum
gauge invariance borrowed from non-abelian quantum gauge theories. the
rst method deals with the ultraviolet problem of quantum gravity and the
second one ensures gauge invariance at the quantum level, formulated by
means of a gauge charge, in each order of perturbation theory. the gauge
charge leads to a characterization of the physical subspace of the graviton
fock space. aspects of quantum gravity coupled to scalar matter elds are
also discussed.

introduction

the central aspect of this work is the construction of the s-matrix for gravity
by means of causality in the quantum eld theoretical (qft) framework. this
idea goes back to stuckelberg, bogoliubov and shirkov and the program was
carried out successfully by epstein and glaser [1, 2] for scalar eld theories
and subsequently applied to qed by scharf [3], to non-abelian gauge theories
by dutsch et al. [4, 5, 6] and to quantum gravity (qg), (by which we mean
a qft of self-interacting massless spin-2 quantum gauge elds on at space-
time), by schorn [7, 8]. for this non-geometrical approach, see [9, 10, 11]. for
our purpose, namely the implementation of qg as a poincare covariant local
quantum eld theory with a considerable gauge arbitrariness, two main tools
will be used: the epstein-glaser inductive construction of the perturbation series
for the s-matrix with the related causal renormalization scheme [1, 3] and the
concept of perturbative operator quantum gauge invariance [6, 12]. a detailed
exposition of what follows can be found in [13, 14, 15, 16].

2 causal perturbation theory

in this section we give a concise review of the causal approach to qft. we
consider the s-matrix, being a formal power series in the coupling constant, as
a sum of smeared operator-valued distributions of the following form [1, 2, 3]

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

1

n!z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn) g(x1)  . . .  g(xn) .

(2.1)

the schwartz test function g  s(r4) plays the role of adiabatically switching
the interaction and provides a natural infrared cuto in the long-range part of
the interaction.

to establish the existence of the adiabatic limit g  1 in theories involving
self-coupled massless particles, like qg, may be problematic. this aspect will
not be considered here.

the n-point operator-valued distributions tn are well-dened renormalized
time-ordered products and can be expressed in terms of wick monomials of free
elds. they are constructed inductively from the rst order t1(x), which plays
the role of the usual interaction lagrangian in terms of free elds, by means of
poincare covariance and causality. the latter, if correctly incorporated, leads
directly to the renormalized perturbation series for the s-matrix which is uv-
nite in every order.

the construction of tn requires some care:

if it were simply given by the

3

usual time-ordering

tn(x1, . . . , xn) = t(cid:8)t1(x1) . . . t1(xn)(cid:9)

(x0

= xn

(2)) . . . (x0

(1)  x0
 t1(x(1)) . . . t1(x(n)) ,

(n1)  x0

(n))

(2.2)

1 > x0

if we have x0

2 > . . . > x0

then uv-divergences would appear. if the arguments x1, . . . , xn are all time-
n, then tn is rigorously given
ordered, i.e.
by tn(x1, . . . , xn) = t1(x1) . . . t1(xn). since tn has to be totally symmetric
in x1, . . . , xn, we so obtain tn everywhere except for the complete diagonal
n = {x1 = x2 = . . . = xn}, i.e. except for the coincident point in congura-
tion space. the correct treatment of this point constitutes the key to control
the uv-behaviour of the n-point distributions. indeed, products of feynman
propagators with coincident arguments

(x  y) =df
(p) z d4k

m(x  y)  df
m(x  y) = ?
1

(p  k)2  m2 + i0

k2  m2 + i0

= logarithmic divergent

(2.3)

are the origin of the uv-divergences in loop graphs, because time-ordering can-
not be done simply by multiplying (singular) distributions by discontinuous
-distributions, since this procedure is usually ill-dened.

the distributions must be carefully split into a retarded and an advanced

part for the tn to be well-dened and nite.

let us illustrate how the inductive construction works by means of an ex-
ample in which t2(x1, x2) is constructed for a massive scalar eld  with a
3-coupling.

we dene a qft by giving the equation of motion of the free quantum eld,
the covariant commutator rule and the interaction lagrangian t1 with coupling
strength g

(cid:0) + m2(cid:1) (x) = 0 ,

[(x1), (x2)] = idm(x1  x2) ,

t1(x) = i g : (x)3 : ,
(2.4)

where dm is the massive jordanpauli distribution

dm(x) =

i

(2)3z d4p (p2  m2) sgn(p0) eipx .

(2.5)

causality of the s-matrix means

s(g1 + g2) = s(g2)s(g1)

for

supp(g1) < supp(g2) .

(2.6)

the notation < in the support condition means more precisely: supp(g1) 
(cid:8)supp(g2) + v +(cid:9) = .

4

translated in terms of t2(x1, x2), the condition of causality becomes

t2(x1, x2) =(t1(x1)t1(x2)

t1(x2)t1(x1)

for x1 > x2 ,
for x2 > x1 .

(2.7)

clearly, diculties arise for x1 = x2.

following the causal construction of epstein and glaser, we dene the auxi-

liary distributions

r
2(x1, x2) := t1(x2)t1(x1) , a

2(x1, x2) := t1(x1)t1(x2)

d2(x1, x2) := r

2(x1, x2)  a

2(x1, x2) ,

(2.8)

and carry out all possible contractions in d2 using wicks lemma, leading to

d2(x1, x2) =

3

xk=1

: ok(x1, x2) : d[k]

2 (x1  x2) .

(2.9)

: ok(x1, x2) : represents a normally ordered product of free eld operators and
d[k]
2 (x1  x2) is a numerical distribution. expanding the result we can identify
tree, loop and vacuum graph contributions (no tadpoles appear), respectively

d2(x1, x2) =+ : (x1)(x1)(x2)(x2) : d[1]

2 (x1  x2) +

+ : (x1)(x2) : d[2]

2 (x1  x2) + d[3]

2 (x1  x2) ,

(2.10)

where the numerical distributions are given by

d[1]
d[2]
d[3]

2 (x1  x2) = 9ig2(cid:2)d(+)
2 (x1  x2) = 18g2(cid:2)d(+)
2 (x1  x2) = 6ig2(cid:2)d(+)

m (x1  x2) + d()
m (x1  x2)2  d()
m (x1  x2)3 + d()

m (x1  x2)(cid:3) = 9ig2dm(x1  x2) ,
m (x1  x2)2(cid:3) ,
m (x1  x2)3(cid:3) .
r2(x1, x2) :=  t1(x2)t1(x1) + t2(x1, x2) ,
a2(x1, x2) :=  t1(x1)t1(x2) + t2(x1, x2) ;

in addition, we dene

(2.11)

(2.12)

so that

d2(x1, x2) = r2(x1, x2)  a2(x1, x2) .

from this last equation, it follows that

t2(x1, x2) = r2(x1, x2)  r

2(x1, x2) .

(2.13)

(2.14)

now, the issue is how to compute r2 without using its denition (since it con-
tains the unknown t2). this can be done by analyzing the support property

5

supp(d[j]

2 (x)) 
of d2: the most important property of d2 is causality, i.e.
v +(x)  v (x), with x := x1  x2.
in order to obtain t2(x1, x2) we have to split the distribution d2 into a
retarded part, r2, and an advanced part, a2, with respect to the coincident
point x = 0, so that supp(r2(x))  v +(x) and supp(a2(x))  v (x).
2 (x) must be accomplished
according to the correct singular order (d[k]
2 ), which agrees here with the usual
power-counting degree of feynman diagrams, and describes the behaviour of
2 (x) near x = 0, or that of d[k]
d[k]

this splitting of the numerical distribution d[k]

2 (p) in the limit p  .

if  < 0, then the splitting is trivial and agrees with the standard time-
if   0, then the splitting is

ordering and we recover the feynman rules.

eq. (2.15) contains a local ambiguity in the normalization: the cas are undeter-
mined nite normalization constants, which multiply terms with local support
 (4)(x1x2). this freedom in the normalization has to be restricted by further
physical conditions, e.g. unitarity, lorentz covariance, existence of the adiabatic
limit and gauge invariance in the case of gauge theories or gravity.

finally, t2 is given by

t2(x1, x2) = r2(x1, x2) + t1(x2)t1(x1) =

applying the described scheme to our example, we nd for the operator-valued

the rst term represents the disconnected contribution coming, in eq. (2.17),

m(x1  x2) is the feynman propagator for the tree graph contribution,

(2.20)

the result of the evaluation of the above integral can be found in sec. 8. since
(d[2]
2 ) = 0, the splitting is not unique and we must take the local normalization
term c0 into account.

we do not give here the expression for the vacuum graph contribution, the

treatment of the latter can be found in sec. 5 and in sec. 8.

the inductive construction can be repeated for every order of perturbation
theory, although the complexity increases. the most delicate step is the distri-
bution splitting, which corresponds to a natural and mathematical well dened
ultraviolet regularization in the usual terminology. the advantage of the causal
scheme is that it leads directly to the renormalized perturbative expansion for
the s-matrix without using a cuto. it makes possible to compute nite ampli-
tudes for various processes to a given order in the coupling constant and it does
not rely on the lagrangian approach.

3 quantization of gravity

3.1 from general relativity to quantum gravity

since we are interested in a quantum theory of einsteins general relativity, we
start from the hilberteinstein lagrangian density lhe written in terms of the
goldberg variable g = g g and we expand it into a power series in the
coupling constant 2 = 32  g, by introducing the graviton eld h dened
through  h = g   , where  = diag(1,1,1,1) is the at space-
time metric tensor

lhe = 2

2

g g r =



xj=0

j l(j)
he .

(3.1)

l(j)
he represents an interaction involving j + 2 gravitons. from this formulation
of general relativity we extract the ingredients for the perturbative construction
of causal qg.

we stress however the fact that we consider the classical lagrangian density
eq. (3.1) only as a source of information about the elds, the couplings and
the gauge which we work with. causal perturbation theory does not rely on a
quantum lagrangian with interacting elds.

7

in a new approach, which has been proposed in [12], one constructs the
rst-order interaction essentially by the requirement of perturbative quantum
gauge invariance (see sec. 4).

by considering the eulerlagrange variation of l(0)

he from eq. (3.1) in the
hilbert gauge h(x), = 0 we obtain the equation of motion for the free graviton
eld h(x) = 0.

3.2 quantum gravity as a quantum field theory

in quantum gravity, we consider the free rank-2 quantum tensor eld h (x),
the graviton, which fulls the free wave equation after having xed the gauge.
for the causal construction we need the commutation relation between free eld
operators at dierent space-time points and the rst-order graviton self-coupling
t h
1 (x).

the graviton eld fulls the lorentz covariant quantization rule

hh(x), h (y)i = 

i

2 (cid:16) +    (cid:17) d0(x  y)

=  i b d0(x  y) ,

(3.2)

where d0(x) is the massless jordanpauli causal distribution.

the rst order coupling among gravitons, being linear in the coupling con-
stant , can be derived from eq. (3.1) by taking the normally ordered product
of l(1)
t h,he
1

he(x) := i

he



(x) = i  : l(1)

2(cid:8) : h(x)h(x),h(x), : +

2

: h(x)h(x),h(x), : +2 : h(x)h (x),h(x), :


+ : h(x)h(x),h(x), : 2 : h(x)h(x),h(x), :(cid:9) .

(3.3)

the non-linearity of gravitation reects itself in the self-coupling of gravitons.
for convenience of notation, h := h
 and all lorentz indices are written as
superscripts whereas the derivatives are written as subscripts. all indices oc-
curring twice are contracted by the minkowski metric  = diag(1,1,1,1).
since the perturbative expansion for the s-matrix is in powers of the coupling
constant , we are allowed to take for the rst order cubic interaction between
gravitons only the contribution coming from l(1)
he.
after quantization, eq. (3.2), the coupling (3.3), completed by a suitable
ghost-graviton coupling term (see sec. 4), can be used in perturbation theory
to calculate quantum corrections to classical general relativity.

two serious problems arise in this procedure. the rst one is the non-
renormalizability of quantum gravity due to presence of two derivatives on the
graviton elds in (3.3) whose origin lies in the dimensionality of the coupling
constant ([] = mass1). the second one is the non-polynomial character of

8

lhe, eq. (3.1), which reects itself into a proliferation of couplings, i.e. into an
increasing polynomial degree in the interaction structure.
the rst drawback, non-renormalizability, can be approached by means of
the inductive causal construction of the tns, which makes it possible to nd
nite and cuto-free quantum corrections for any process describable in the
s-matrix framework, although the solution is not quite clear with regard to
physical predictability due to the increasing number of nite normalization terms
in the distribution splitting (2.15) in each order of perturbation theory.

with regard to the second issue, we could try to generalize the result of [7]
and the more recent result of [12], which suggest that the concept of perturbative
quantum operator gauge invariance (see sec. 4) may be able to explain the higher
polynomial couplings: gauge invariance to second order will automatically imply
the introduction of a quartic graviton interaction exactly as prescribed by the
expansion of the hilberteinstein lagrangian [7], see sec. 5.2. if we were able
to repeat this step in each order of perturbation theory, we would recover the
full einstein gravity in quantum form. at this point the somewhat articial
decomposition of the metric tensor into a at background and a dynamical
variable would acquire a merely book-keeping purpose beside the fact that we
consider an asymptotically at situation.

4 gauge structure of quantum gravity

4.1 gauge charge
the classical gauge transformations h  h +u, +u,u
,, which cor-
responds to the linearized general covariance of g (x) [17], can be implemented
on a quantum level by means of the gauge charge q

(x) = eiqh(x)e+iq ,
h

q := zx0=const

d3x h(x),


x
0 u(x) .

(4.1)

in order to get a nilpotent gauge charge (q2 = 0, in order to prove unitarity of
the s-matrix and to construct the physical subspace of the graviton fock space),
we have to quantize the vector eld u(x), the ghost eld (u (x) = 0), with
its partner u(x), the anti-ghost eld (with u (x) = 0, too), as free fermionic
vector elds through the anti-commutator

whereas all other anti-commutators vanish.

(cid:8)u(x), u (y)(cid:9) = i  d0(x  y) ,

the gauge charge q denes an innitesimal gauge variation by

dqa := q a  (1)ng(a)a q ,

9

(4.2)

(4.3)

where ng(a) is the number of ghost elds minus the number of anti-ghost elds
in the wick monomial a. the operator dq obeys also the leibniz rule

dq(ab) = (dqa) b + (1)ng(a)a dqb ,

(4.4)

for arbitrary operators a and b.

the innitesimal operator gauge variations of the fundamental asymptotic

free quantum elds are

dqh(x) =(cid:2)q, h(x)(cid:3) = i bu(x), ,
dq u(x) =(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = i h (x), .

dqu(x) =(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = 0 ,

4.2 perturbative operator quantum gauge invariance

(4.5)

formally, s-matrix gauge invariance means limg1 dqs(g) = 0. this follows
from

lim

g1(cid:0)s(g)  s(g)(cid:1) = lim

g1

(i [q, s(g)] + higher commutators) = 0 ,

(4.6)

which holds true, if the condition of perturbative gauge invariance to n-th order

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) = [q, tn(x1, . . . , xn)] = sum of divergences ,

(4.7)

is fullled for all n  1.

4.3 gauge invariance to first order
already for n = 1, eq. (4.7) is non-trivial, because dqt h,he
this requires the introduction of a anti-ghostgravitonghost coupling [7]

(x) 6= divergence.

which was rst derived by kugo and ojima in [18, 19]. therefore, we obtain

great detail in [8].

the fermionic quantization of the ghost elds, usually called faddeev-popov
ghosts, is not only necessary for having a nilpotent q, but also for perturbative
gauge invariance to be fullled.

10

in the path-integral framework, the ghost elds appear as a consequence of
the quantization after gauge xing [20], but it was already noticed by feyn-
man [9] that without ghost elds a unitarity breakdown occurs in second order
at the loop level.

although the condition dqt1(x) = divergence seems to be rather easy to
full, it has two important consequences. first of all, it rules out the possibility
of a renormalizable theory of quantum gravity [12], because for a renormalizable
interaction t1(x), i.e. without the two derivatives acting on the elds1, pertur-
bative gauge invariance to rst order entails only the trivial solution t1(x) = 0.
if
(x) is the most general ansatz for the graviton coupling and the most

the other interesting consequence pointed out in [12] is the following:

t h+u

(x) =xj

aj :(cid:8)hhh(cid:9)j : +xj

bj :(cid:8)uhu(cid:9)j : ,

(4.10)

(with two derivatives acting on the elds), then the requirement dqt h+u
(x) =
divergence selects a small number of possible theories and the hilberteinstein
graviton coupling t h,he
, lies among
them. moreover, all the allowed couplings can be transformed in such a way
that the most general coupling has now the form

(x) + divergence couplings + dq(uhh + uuu) .

(4.11)

the last term represents the so-called coboundary terms which, together with
divergence terms, seem to play no physical role.

the denition of the q-vertex from eq. (4.9) allows us to give a precise
prescription on how the right side of eq. (4.7) has to be inductively constructed.
we dene the concept of perturbative quantum operator gauge invariance by the
equation

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) =

n

xl=1


x
l

t 
n/l(x1, . . . , xl, . . . , xn) .

(4.12)

here, t 
n/l is the time-ordered renormalized product, obtained according to the
inductive causal scheme, with a q-vertex at xl, while all other n 1 vertices are
ordinary t1-vertices.
analysis of the condition (4.12) shows that perturbative gauge invariance can
be spoiled by local terms, i.e. terms proportional to :o(x1, . . . , xn) : (4n4)(x1
xn, . . . , xn1 xn), which may appear as a consequence of distribution splitting
on both sides of eq. (4.12).

1with only one derivative it is impossible to form a lorentz scalar interaction term

n/l(cid:17)(x1, . . . , xl, . . . , xn) (4.13)

before undertaking the examination of the various contributions in second order
perturbation theory (tree, self-energy and vacuum graphs), we give the formula
for the singular order of arbitrary n-point distributions in perturbative quantum
gravity.

we consider in the n-th order of perturbation theory an arbitrary n-point
n (x1, . . . , xn), appearing in eq. (2.1), as a sum of normally ordered

distribution t g
products of free eld operators multiplied by numerical distributions

t g
n (x1, . . . , xn) =:

h(xkj )

nh

yj=1

nu

yi=1

u(xmi)

n u

yl=1

u(xnl) : tg

n(x1, . . . , xn) .

(5.1)

n corresponds to a graph g with nh external graviton lines , nu external

this t g
ghost lines and nu external anti-ghost lines.

the singular order of g then reads

(g)  4  nh  nu  nu  d + n .

(5.2)

here d is the number of derivatives on the external eld operators in (5.1).
the  means that in certain cases the singular order is lowered by peculiar
conditions, e.g. by the equations of motions of free elds.
in the usual qft formulation, eq. (5.2) implies the non-renormalizability
of qg, because (g) increases without bound for higher orders in the pertur-
bative expansion. this means that there is a proliferation of divergences and of
counterterms (one still has to hope that the needed counterterms can be tted
into the original lagrangian) to remove them.

the hope that qg was uv-nite to all orders failed after the two-loop cal-

culation in [21, 22, 23], although the one-loop order is uv-nite [24, 25].

the situation is dierent in causal perturbation theory: we are facing in this
case a non-normalizable theory. the theory has a weaker predictive power but
it is still well-dened in the sense of uv niteness.

the ambiguity in the normalization reects itself into an increasing number
of free, undetermined but nite constants in eq. (2.15). the problem is then to
nd enough physical conditions or requirements to x this increasing freedom
and to investigate the eects of these local interactions for physical quantities.

12

5.1 graviton self-energy

we investigate the graviton self-energy contribution (graviton and ghost loops)
in second order. as in sec. 2, the inductive construction of t2(x1, x2) can be
accomplished in two steps: in the rst place we construct the causal distribution
d2 from eq. (3.3) and (4.8) by applying wick expansion with the contractions
given by eq. (3.2)

dse

2 (x1, x2) =ht h+u

(x2)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)se

(5.3)

=: h(x1)h (x2) : dse

2 (x1  x2) .
because of translation invariance the c-number distribution dse
2 depends only
on the relative coordinate x = x1  x2. in momentum space we obtain for the
self-energy tensor

dse
2 (p) = p (p)(4)

 (p2) sgn(p0) ,

(5.4)

where p (p)(4)

 is a covariant polynomial of degree 4

 162 p4(cid:0) +  (cid:1) + 118 p4(cid:21) .

(5.5)

then, in order to obtain t se
order (dse
thus, admitting free normalization polynomial terms n(p)
spond to local interaction terms in conguration space, we obtain

is calculated from the massless causal scalar distribution d(p) = r(p)  a(p) =
(p2) sgn(p0) in eq. (5.4) by splitting it into d(p) = r(p) a(p) and subtracting
r(p) from r(p), see [5, 14]. the mass scale m0 represents a normalization
constant and not a cuto.

13

to get a condition for the undetermined normalization terms, we consider
the sum of the proper self-energy diagrams with an increasing number of self-
energy insertions. by requiring that the mass of the graviton (which is zero) and
the coupling constant  remain unchanged under these radiative corrections, we
nd that all normalization terms must vanish, except for the term of degree 4
which can be absorbed in the new parameter m 2

0 , see [14] for details.

we emphasize the fact that, in virtue of the causal splitting prescription,
all expressions are uv-nite and eq. (5.6) agrees exactly with the nite part
obtained using standard regularization schemes [26, 27]. as a consequence it is
not necessary to add counterterms [24] to the original lagrangian in order to
renormalize the theory.

the graviton self-energy satises the slavnovward identity for the 2-point

connected green function [26, 27]

pp(cid:8)b(cid:2) se,grav.(p) + se,ghost(p)(cid:3)b(cid:9) = 0 ,

(5.8)

only if ghost and graviton loops are taken into account, as well as perturbative
gauge invariance, eq. (4.7): dqt se

2 (x1, x2) = divergence.

the result of eq. (5.6) can also be used to nd the long range, low energy
quantum corrections to the newtonian potential between two bodies of mass
m1 and m2 at a distance r in the non-relativistic static limit (see sec. 8 for the
coupling between matter and gravity).

in the spirit of [28, 29, 30], but without resorting to any eective eld theore-
tical calculation, we compute a mattermatter scattering diagram with exchange
of one graviton. the corresponding scattering amplitude leads to the newtonian
potential v (r) = g m1m2 r1.
considering also the radiative corrections coming from the graviton self-
energy, we obtain quantum corrections to the newtonian potential. more pre-
cisely, we nd that the logarithm depending term in eq. (5.6) gives the r3-
correction

v (r) = g m1 m2

r

(cid:18)1 +

206
30

g 

c3  r2(cid:19) .

(5.9)

in sec. 8, when we consider also scalar massless matter, we will nd supplemen-
tary corrections coming from these massless particle loops.

the central piece in the calculation is the distributional fourier transform of

0(cid:1) which yields (2r3)1 and the m0-dependence disappears from
log(cid:0)p2/m 2
the non-local part of the nal result, being proportional to (3)(x) with r = |x|.
the relevant length scale appearing in eq. (5.9) is the planck length pl. =
pg/c3. therefore, appreciable quantum corrections manifest themselves only
for r  pl..
our result agrees with the corresponding one in [30], although this represents
only a partial correction to the newtonian potential, because we have taken
into account only the graviton self-energy contribution and not the complete

14

set of diagrams of order 4 contributing to these corrections, as, for example,
the vertex correction or the double scattering. therefore we cannot make any
statement on the absolute sign of the correction in eq. (5.9).

5.2 tree graphs and gauge invariance

for the tree graphs we quote briey the result of schorn [7, 8]: perturbative
gauge invariance to second order generates the 4-graviton coupling.
the condition of perturbative gauge invariance to second order

dqt2(x, y) = x

 t 

2/1(x, y) + y

 t

(5.10)

restricted to the operator structure : uhhh : and : uuuh : can be spoiled by
terms with local support, namely proportional to (4)(xy): local normalization
terms n2, n 
2/2 respectively, and local anomalies2.
therefore, we have to investigate the equation

2/2 of t2, t 

2/1 and n 

2/1 and t 

dqn2(x, y) = an(cid:0)x

 n 

2/1(x, y) + y

 n 

2/2(x, y) ,

(5.11)

which relates the local terms appearing in eq. (5.10).

we take advantage of the freedom in the normalization of tree diagrams with
singular order   0 (they appear because of the two derivatives present in the
coupling) by choosing local normalization terms n2(x, y) of the form
n2(x, y) = i 2n+ : hhh

(5.12)

for eq. (5.11) to be fullled, see [7] for details.

taking the factor 1/2 for the second order of the s-matrix expansion into
account, these quartic interactions (quadratic in ) agree exactly with the terms
of order 2 in the expansion of the hilberteinstein lagrangian density leh
given by eq. (3.1). this mechanism of generation of the higher orders works in
a purely quantum framework.

0 (x  y)

15

such a property was already observed in yangmills theories [4]: starting
with an interaction between three gauge elds, perturbative gauge invariance
generates automatically the 4-gauge elds coupling.

since qg is constructed starting from a non-polynomial lagrangian, it is not
clear if this scheme would also work in higher orders and the question whether
perturbative gauge invariance to n-th order requires the introduction of local
terms which turn out to agree with the (n + 1)-th term in the expansion of the
hilberteinstein lagrangian remains unanswered.

5.3 vacuum graphs in second order

we discuss also the vacuum graphs in second order. in the causal perturbation
theory they cannot be divided away as in the gellmann and low series for
connected green functions, but this is not a problem because they are nite as
a consequence of the causal scheme. the corresponding distribution t v g
has
been obtained by computing three contractions in eq. (2.10). it has singular
order  = 6 and reads

p6 log(cid:18)(p2 + i0)

m 2

(5.13)

it is possible to prove the free vacuum stability in qg as described in [31]:

limg1(cid:0), s(g)(cid:1) = 1, where  is the fock vacuum of free asymptotic elds.
perturbatively this means limg1(cid:0), sn(g)(cid:1) = 0 ,n  1.
we perform the adiabatic limit in scaling form: g(x) = g0(x) where   0
and g0  s(r4) with g0(0) = 1. for n = 2 we get
(p)i g0(p) g0(p) = 0 ,
g1(cid:0), s2(g)(cid:1) =

+ n v g

as a consequence of the bad uv behaviour of qg ( t v g

2

(p)  p6).

at the same time, free vacuum stability forces the free normalization con-
stants ci to vanish. this allows the graviton to show up as an asymptotic particle
carrying the long range gravitational interaction.

6 the physical subspace fphys

an interesting feature of this approach to the gauge structure of qg is the
construction of the physical hilbertfock space for the asymptotic free graviton
eld.

in order to decouple the ghosts and the unphysical degrees of freedom of the
graviton from the truly physical degrees of freedom in the theory, we could apply
the gupta-bleuler [32] formalism with indenite metric, but we prefer to realize

16

the free eld representations on a fock space with positive denite metric [33].
lorentz covariance requires then the introduction of a krein structure [34, 35]
on the fock space and we can characterize the physical subspace fphys by the
following denition

fphys := kernq, qo .

(6.1)

in order to verify the consistency of this formula, we need an explicit represen-
tation of the free elds appearing in the theory.

since a symmetric tensor eld with arbitrary trace transforms under the
proper lorentz group l
+ according to the tensor product of two spinor represen-
tations d(1/2,1/2), we decompose h(x) according to the irreducible reduction
of the representations

into

d(1/2,1/2)  d(1/2,1/2)|sym = d(1,1)  d(0,0) ,

h(x) = h (x) +

(x) ,

1
4

(6.2)

(6.3)

where h (x) represents a traceless symmetric tensor eld dened as h (x) :=
h(x) h(x)/4 with h 
 = 0 (9 degrees of freedom) and (x) a scalar eld
with h

 = . from eq. (3.2) we obtain the following commutation relations

(cid:2)(x), (y)(cid:3) = 4 i d0(x  y) ,

i

(cid:2)h (x), (y)(cid:3) = 0 ,

(cid:2)h (x), h  (y)(cid:3) = 

2(cid:0) +   
= i t d0(x  y) .

1
2

(cid:1) d0(x  y)

(6.4)

for the quantization of h (x) and (x) we choose the following free eld

representations

h (x) = (2)3/2z d3k
(x) = (2)3/2z d3k

2(cid:16)a(k)eikx + a(k)ke+ikx(cid:17) ,
2(cid:16)a(k)eikx + a(k)ke+ikx(cid:17) ,

(6.5)

where the krein conjugation k is dened by the krein operators h and 

(a)k = ha 

h ,

h =

(a)k = a ,

 = (1)n , n =

3

(1)n0i , n0i = 2z d3k a0i(k)a0i(k) ;
oi=1

1

4z d3k a(k)a(k) .

(6.6)

the elds are then k-selfconjugate and not -selfadjoint, but the eld com-
ponents which spoil the selfadjointness turn out to be the unphysical ones and

17

therefore these will be absent in the physical subspace fphys, so that on fphys one
has h  k
. the absorption and creation operators a = a , a 
and a, a satisfy the canonical commutation relations

= h  

(cid:2)a(k), a (p)(cid:3) =

with i, j = 1, 2, 3; i 6= j. from this table we see that the t -tensor is neither

order to remedy these defects, we dene new absorption operators

a00 =

(a11 + a22 + a33) ,
(+a11 + a22  a33) ;

(6.8)

and analogously for the creation operators. then we obtain the commutation
relations

(cid:2)aii(k), ajj(p)(cid:3) = ij (3)(k  p) .

(6.9)

note that the operators a00 and a00 do not appear here because this operator
pair is superuous due to the trace condition h 

 = 0.

now we want to specify the physical subspace with the help of the gauge

charge q, which now reads

q = zx0=t

(x),(cid:17)

0 u(x) .

(6.10)

for this purpose, we need the free eld representations of the ghost elds. we
follow in our discussion the analysis of the scalar ghost elds for yangmills
theories carried out in [34]. here we are dealing with vector ghost elds and we
choose the following free eld representations

u(x) = (2)3/2z d3p
u(x) = (2)3/2z d3p

2(cid:16) + b(p)eipx   c(p)eipx(cid:17) ,
2(cid:16)  c(p)eipx  b(p)eipx(cid:17) ;

(6.11)

18

which satisfy the covariant commutation rule eq. (4.2), whereas the absorption
and creation operators satisfy the commutation relations

(cid:8)c(p), c (k)(cid:9) =  (3)(p  k) ,
(cid:8)b(p), b (k)(cid:9) =  (3)(p  k) .

extending the -conjugation to the k-conjugation we obtain the most symmetric
form

(6.12)

(6.13)

u(x) = (2)3/2z d3p
u(x) = (2)3/2z d3p

2(cid:16) + b (p)eipx + b(p)keipx(cid:17) ,
2(cid:16)  c (p)eipx + c(p)keipx(cid:17) .

this implies (cid:0)u(cid:1)k = u and (cid:0)u(cid:1)k = u, or equivalently: (cid:0)bi(cid:1)k = ci,
(cid:0)ci(cid:1)k = bi,(cid:0)b0(cid:1)k = c0 and (cid:0)c0(cid:1)k = b0.
the construction of the krein operator g on the ghost fock space which
generates the transformations (o)k = gog from the -conjugation to the
k-conjugation requires more work, see [14], and reads

four -longitudinal modes number operators, as well as the scalar component a

k is not independent, being a linear combination of the
a0i-operators and we have not taken into account that a = 0.

for this purpose let us choose a reference frame in which k = (, 0, 0, ) is
parallel to the third axis, because obviously the unphysical graviton modes de-
pend on k, and substitute the as by the aiis, eq. (6.8), so that the integrand

of (cid:8)q, q(cid:9) restricted to the graviton sector becomes

therefore eq. (6.1) denes the physical subspace in a correct manner. a

dierent formulation of the graviton quantization can be found in [36].

in addition, we can compute the generators of the time evolutions of the
elds h (x) and (x), respectively. these free quantum elds satisfy the
heisenberg equations of motion

i h (x) =(cid:2)hh, h (x)(cid:3) , i (x) =(cid:2)h, (x)(cid:3) .

which conrms that graviton states in fphys have only two independent com-

 absorb or
create physical states with helicities  2.

7 unitarity

the property of unitarity in qg, as in non-abelian gauge theories, is very
important (and usually very dicult to prove), because the fock space contains
a lot of unphysical states (see sec. 6).

nevertheless, there exists a physical subspace fphys, such that the s-matrix
restricted to fphys is unitary. because of the unphysical degrees of freedom
involved in the theory, unitarity does not hold on the whole fock space. there,
the theory is pseudo-unitary, namely unitary with respect to the k-conjugation.
= h  and k = , it follows that

t h+u

is skew-k-conjugate

(7.1)

and this holds for all the n-point distributions tn by induction [3, 35] if the
normalization constants in the distribution splitting eq. (2.15) are chosen ap-
propriately:

tn(x)k = tn(x) ,

(7.2)
where x := {x1, . . . , xn} and tn(x) is the n-point distribution belonging to the
perturbative expansion of the inverse s-matrix. according to eq. (7.2), we get
pseudo-unitarity

s(g)k = s(g)1 .

(7.3)

we cannot expect unitarity on the whole fock space because the scalar graviton
, the 0i-components of h  and the ghosts are not hermitian (with respect to
), but only skew-hermitian.

with unitarity on the physical subspace we mean the heuristic equation

lim

g1 hpphys s(g) pphysihpphys s(g) pphysi = pphys ,

(7.4)

(8.8)

also in this case, gauge invariance to second order requires the introduction
of a new mattergraviton local interaction which turns out to agree with the
second order in the classical expansion of lm given in eq. (8.1), up to the factor
1/2 coming from the scattering matrix.
(x, y) = divergence, because
the local anomaly of eq. (8.6) does not appear. this agrees with the fact that
for massless matter l(j)

in the massless case we obtain directly dqt tree

m = 0, j  2.

the above calculation shows that, in our approach, scalar matter coupled to
qg does not require the introduction of a non-renormalizable counterterm [24,
25], i.e. of a counterterm that cannot be absorbed in the redenitions of bare
parameters appearing in the original lagrangian of the theory.

9 abelian gauge fields coupled to quantum grav-

ity

we discuss very briey the coupling between gravitons and u (1)-abelian gauge
elds (photons), see [15] for the details.

coupling constant  and isolate the rst order coupling

where the self-energy tensor reads

and satises the perturbative gauge invariance condition (and as a consequence
the slavnovward identity) as in sec. (8.2), and, in addition, is transversal
p (p) = 0 and traceless  (p) = 0.

the photon loop graviton self-energy contributes also to the corrections of

the newtonian potential as the graviton and ghost loop:

in both cases, we nd uv-nite and cuto-free results for our one-loop calcula-
tions. therefore the introduction of counterterms (that cannot be renormalized
away, see [25, 38, 39]) is not necessary.

10 general ansatz for matter coupling and pertur-

bative gauge invariance

in this section we adopt a new strategy [6, 12] in order to construct a gauge
invariant theory of quantum gravity coupled to matter elds.

this purely quantum approach relies merely on the inductive causal con-
struction of tn (see sec. 2) and on the perturbative quantum gauge invariance
condition (see sec. 4.2). it does not appeal to any classical lagrangian density
and uses only free quantum elds. in [12] this idea was implemented for pure
qg, as already explained above.

28

10.1 massive case

we adopt the same strategy by choosing the following ansatz for the most gen-
eral massive matter coupling (disregarding non-relevant divergence couplings)
between one graviton and two matter elds



t m
1 (x) = i

2(cid:0) + x : h,, : +y : h,, : +z : h, : +w m2 : h :(cid:1) ,
where x, y, z, w  r are undetermined coecients. the quantized graviton and
matter elds satisfy the commutation rules eq. (3.2) and eq. (8.3), respectively.
1 =

the condition of perturbative gauge invariance to rst order, dqt m

(10.33)

in second order, for the graviton self-energy t se

divergence, implies y = z/2  w  x/2.
2 =
divergence (which is equivalent to the slavnovward identity) implies w =
x/2 so that the general matter coupling becomes

2(cid:0) + x : h,, : +

m2 : h :(cid:1) ,

(10.34)

with only two undetermined coecients instead of four.

the analysis of perturbative gauge invariance to second order in the tree

sector gives two possible solutions:

dqt tree

2

(x1, x2) + dqn tree

2

(x1, x2) = divergence  x = z

or

x = z + 1 .
(10.35)

both of the conditions on the right side are in agreement with the natural
assumption that the rst order coupling can be written as

t m
1 (x) = i


2

: h(x) b 

m (x) :

(10.36)

for an improved energy-momentum tensor with 
appears here because we are using the expansion of the goldberg variable.

m (x), = 0. the b -tensor

thus, we have seen that if we start with the most general ansatz for t m
1 ,
eq. (10.33), with four undetermined parameters, then perturbative gauge in-
variance up to the second order is able to reduce this number to one. analysis
of the third order should then x unambiguously this last parametric freedom.

10.2 massless case

as in the previous section, we investigate if the condition of perturbative quan-
tum gauge invariance is strong enough to select by itself, among all the possi-
ble couplings between massless matter elds and gravitons, the right coupling,
namely to select only one coupling which, in addition, should agree with the
expansion of the classical lagrangian.

29

let us write the most general ansatz for the massless matter coupling (dis-

regarding unimportant divergence couplings) as

t m
1 (x) = i

= i

2(cid:0) + x : h,, : +y : h, : +z : h, :(cid:1)

: h(x) b 

m (x) : ,

(10.37)

where x, y, z  r are undetermined coecients and 
momentum tensor with 

m (x), = 0.

m an improved energy-

to establish a connection between our undetermined coecients x, y, z and

the classical theory, we expand the non-minimally matter coupled lagrangian

lm =

1
2

g(cid:0)g ;; +  r 2(cid:1)

(10.38)

in terms of the graviton eld and compare the coecients. we obtain the
relations: x = 1  2, y =  and z = 2.
sor [40].

if  = 1/6 we obtain the callan-jackiw improved energy-momentum ten-

on the other side we can also consider in eq. (10.37) the most general

conserved and traceless energy-momentum tensor


m =  ,, 


4

 ,, 


2

, ,   r ,

(10.39)

which gives the relations x = , y = /4 and z = /2.

gauge invariance to rst order, dqt m
1 = divergence is then always satised.
gauge invariance to second order for the matter loop graviton self-energy ,
2 = divergence, requires that y = z/2.
since the particle circulating in the loop is massless, we expect the self-energy

dqt se

tensor to be traceless, too. this implies y = x/4 and z = x/2.
with these relations among the parameters we can undertake the investiga-
tion of perturbative gauge invariance to second order in the tree graph sector.
we nd again

dqt tree

2

(x1, x2) + dqn tree

2

(x1, x2) = divergence  x = z

or

x = z + 1 .
(10.40)

obviously the rst relation x = z cannot be satised by our coecients in both
cases, eq. (10.38) and eq. (10.39), therefore should be rejected.

the second relation x = z + 1 is satised   r in the case of non-minimal
matter coupling r2. the reason is that this term has zero gauge variation so
that its addition to the term : h,, :, which is already gauge invariant to
rst and second order alone, does not change the theory from the point of view
of the gauge structure.

on the other side, if we examine the relation x = z +1 in view of eq. (10.39),
we nd that it has only one solution, namely  = 2/3. therefore, according to

30

our strategy, perturbative quantum gauge invariance to rst and second order,
together with some assumptions about the structure of the massless matter
energy-momentum tensor, eq. (10.39), leads to the coupling

t m
1 (x) = i

this result is equivalent to the choice of  = 1/6 in eq. (10.38) and, equivalently,
to the use of the callan-jackiw improved energy-momentum tensor.
