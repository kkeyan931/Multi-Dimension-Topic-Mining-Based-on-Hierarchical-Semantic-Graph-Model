abstract

a state saturating a bps bound derived from a supersymmetry algebra preserves some

fraction of the supersymmetry. this fraction of supersymmetry depends on the charges

carried by the system, and we show that in general there are congurations of charges

for which a bps state would preserve more than half the original supersymmetry. we

investigate congurations that could preserve 3/4 supersymmetry in string theory, m-

theory and supersymmetric eld theories and discuss whether states saturating these

bounds actually occur in these theories.

1 introduction

it is well known that the supersymmetry algebra admits central charges that give bps

bounds on the energy. these charges can be carried by solitons and when the bound

is saturated the states preserve some fraction of the supersymmetry. in addition there

are tensorial central charges carried by various p-branes in string/m-theory, for ex-

ample, that lead to bps bounds on the energy densities of the branes, and the bps

p-branes preserve 1/2 of the supersymmetry [1]. the p-branes can intersect with or

end on other branes while still preserving some supersymmetry, and intersecting brane

congurations have been found that preserve fractions n/32 of the supersymmetry for

n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16 so that in each of these cases no more than half the supersym-

metry is preserved; see, for example, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

by examining the supersymmetry algebra it is simple to see that there must exist

charges that would correspond to preservation of any fraction n/m of supersymmetry

(where m is the number of supersymmetries of the system, so that m = 32 for m-

theory). the general anticommutator of n supercharges qi (with  a spinor index and

i = 1, ..., n) can be written as

{qa, qb} = mab

(1)

where a = 1, ..., m is a composite index a = {i} and mab is a symmetric matrix of
bosonic charges, which in most physical systems will take the form

mab = hab  zab

(2)

with h the hamiltonian and zab a traceless symmetric matrix of central charges which

can be decomposed into a set of p-form charges z ij

1...p

contracted with gamma matrices.

let the eigenvalues of zab be 1, ..., m withp a = 0. then the supersymmetry algebra
implies that mab must be positive denite so that the energy e is bounded below by the
largest eigenvalue, e   where  = max{1, ...m}, as is easily seen in a basis in which
zab is diagonal. if the largest eigenvalue is n-fold degenerate, 1 = 2 = ... = n   say,
and if there is a state that saturates the bound with e = , then for this state mab will

have n zero eigenvalues and by denition the state will preserve n of the supersymmetries,

namely q1, q2, ..., qn, and should t into a supermultiplet generated by the action of the

1

remaining m  n supercharges. thus a system will have a state preserving a given
fraction n/m of supersymmetry provided (i) there is a conguration of charges such that

the maximal eigenvalue of zab is n-fold degenerate and (ii) there is a state that saturates

the bps bound for these charges.

in many physical systems, zab is an arbitrary symmetric traceless matrix, since a

conguration of charges can be found that gives any desired zab. for example, in m-
theory the matrix mab has 3233/2 = 528 independent entries and all 528 arise from the
11-momentum, a 2-form charge and a 5-form charge, as 11+55+462=528 [7]. moreover,

each of the 527 charges zab is believed to actually arise in m-theory, and there is a 1/2-

supersymmetric bps state for each of the 527 charges [8]. most have been constructed

explicitly, while evidence for the occurrence of the m9-brane is given in [9, 10]. then

in m-theory there is a conguration of charges corresponding to each fraction n/32 of
supersymmetry for 0  n  32, and most can be realised without recourse to m9-branes.
if m-theory is dimensionally reduced to one dimension by compactifying all the spatial

dimensions, the resulting theory is a quantum mechanical theory with 32 supersymme-

tries and algebra (1),(2), where a = 1, ..., 32 is now an internal index transforming under

an sp(32) internal symmetry, and zab represents 527 scalar central charges, transform-

ing irreducibly under the sp(32) automorphism group of the superalgebra, which is a

contraction of osp(32/1). all central charges are then clearly on the same footing, and

there seems no reason why an arbitrary central charge matrix zab, and hence an arbitrary

fraction of supersymmetry n/32, should not be realisable.

if there is a set of charges in a supersymmetric theory for which the maximal eigenvalue

of zab is n-fold degenerate, and if there is a state which saturates the bps bound, it

would preserve n/m of the supersymmetries. in most cases that have been studied and

for which the state of lowest energy has been found, it turns out to be a supersymmetric

one saturating the bound. the fact that most allowed supersymmetric states actually

occur suggests that it would be of interest to investigate further the congurations that

could preserve exotic fractions of supersymmetry.

our purpose here will be to give some simple examples in which there is a bps bound

for which a state saturating it would preserve 3/4 supersymmetry, and to give some

preliminary discussion as to whether such states actually occur.

2

we will rst consider the supersymmetry algebra in four dimensions. it is straight-

forward to provide charges that lead to preservation of 3/4 of the supersymmetry.

it

is straightforward to embed this algebraic structure in higher dimensions and we will

focus on d=11. we will show that the charges preserving 3/4 of the supersymmetry can

be realised by considering a very simple conguration of a membrane intersecting two

vebranes according to the array

where the symbol  is read as 10, with the amount of supersymmetry preserved depend-

ing on the energy and the charges of the three branes. the case that has been discussed

previously [3, 4] is that in which the product of all three brane charges is positive (in

our conventions), leading to 1/4 supersymmetry being preserved, whereas we will nd

new possibilities when one of the branes has negative charge, and so is an anti-brane

(or all three are anti-branes). we will analyse this case in some detail and determine

under which conditions the fractions 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 of the supersymmetry could be

preserved. one interesting feature is that for three or more intersecting branes, switching

all the branes to anti-branes can lead to inequivalent results, whereas for congurations

with just two branes, equivalent results would be obtained by the switch. many other

congurations of branes with exotic supersymmetry in m-theory or string theory can be

generated from this example by dualities.

exotic supersymmetry in d=4

the general n extended superalgebra in four dimensions is

{qi, qj} = p ij  + v ij

  + iy ij

 5 + x ij

  + iz ij + i z ij 5

(4)

where qi, i = 1, ..., n is a majorana spinor, the charges y ij

 , z ij , z ij are antisymmetric
in the ij indices while v ij
is traceless. in supersymmetric
theories, p is the 4-momentum, z and z are electric and magnetic 0-brane charges, x

 are symmetric and v ij


 , x ij

are domain wall charges [11], vi, yi are string charges (i = 1, 2, 3) and v0, y0 are charges

3

for space-lling 3-branes [8]. moreover, in some cases pi could be a linear combination of

the momentum and a string charge, while p0 could be a linear combination of the energy

and a 3-brane charge.

the number of charges on the right-hand-side of (4) is 10n(n +1)/2+6n(n1)/2,
which agrees with the number of components, 2n(4n + 1), of the left-hand-side. this

suggests that by choosing the charges on the right hand side, it should be possible to nd

a system for which the bps bound would lead to any fraction n/4n supersymmetry being

preserved, provided that there existed a state saturating the bps bound. in particular,

there are some very simple systems that could allow 3/4 supersymmetry.

for example, consider n = 2 supersymmetry with only the charges p and y ij

 =

1

2yij non-zero. a convenient choice of gamma matrices is

0 =   0

i

i

0! ,

i =   0
ii

ii

0 ! ,

5 =   1

0

0 1!

(5)

then congurations with p 0 = e, p 3 = p, y0 = u and y3 = v and all other charges zero

have the superalgebra

{q, q} = diag(e  1, e  2, e  3, e  4)

where q = (q1 + iq2)/2 and the eigenvalues i are given by

1 = p + u + v

2 = u  p  v
3 = v  u  p
4 = p  u  v

(6)

(7)

note that there is a symmetry in the way the three charges occur. positivity implies that
the energy e satises e  i for each i. if only one of the charges is non-zero, u say, then
e  u and e  u so that we obtain the standard bound e  |u|. with two charges,
u and v say, we obtain e  |u + v| and e  |u  v| and when one of these is saturated
we have a conguration preserving 1/4 supersymmetry. with all three charges, there are

four bounds corresponding to the four eigenvalues and in general when one is saturated

there will be 1/4 supersymmetry preserved. however, for special values of the charges

4

there can be degenerate eigenvalues. consider for example the case in which all charges
are equal, u = v = p =  so that

{q, q} = diag(h + 3, h  , h  , h  )

(8)

if  is positive, a state with e =  would preserve the 3/4 supersymmetry corresponding

to supersymmetry parameters of the form  = (0, 2, 3, 4). for negative , a bps state
with e = 3 would preserve 1/4 supersymmetry.

in [12], it will be shown that a similar example occurs in the wess-zumino model with

n = 1 supersymmetry. in that case, there is again a simple conguration, corresponding

to intersecting domain walls with momentum along the intersection, for which a state

saturating the bounds would have 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4 supersymmetry, depending on the

values of the charges.

3 exotic supersymmetry in string theory and m-

theory

3.1 m-theory

the general form of the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra has

{q, q} = c(m pm 

1
2!

m1m2zm1m2 

1
5!

m1...m5zm1...m5) ,

(9)

where c is the charge conjugation matrix, pm is the energy-momentum 11-vector and

zm1m2 and zm1...m5 are 2-form and 5-form charges. the fraction of preserved super-

symmetry preserved by a conguration possessing a given set of charges is given by the
number of zero eigenvalues of the matrix {q, q} divided by 32. as argued in the in-
troduction, both sides have equal numbers of components (528), and all 528 charges on

the right hand side actually arise in m-theory, provided we include m9-branes carrying

the charge z0i [8], so that there must be congurations of charges that could give rise to

all fractions n/32 of preserved supersymmetry, provided bps states arise in that charge

sector.

5

for 3/4 supersymmetry, there is a very simple set of charges corresponding to two

vebranes and a membrane that allows 3/4 of the supersymmetry, obtained by embedding

the example of the last section in 11 dimensions and using dualities. in addition we will

show that there are some novel combinations of three charges leading to the preservation

of 1/4 and 1/2 supersymmetry. it is known [3, 4] that it is possible to have two vebranes

and a membrane intersecting according to (3) and preserving 1/4 of the supersymmetry,

provided the product of all three brane charges is positive. changing the signs of one

or three of the charges and tuning their values allows 3/4 supersymmetry instead, as we

shall see.

we begin by assuming that the only non-zero charges in (9) are

q5 = z12345

q
5 = z16789

q2 = z1

(10)

and positive charges will correspond to branes and negative charges to anti-branes. we

use real gamma matrices with c = 0 and 0123456789 = 1. it will be convenient to take

a basis such that

012345 = diag(1, 1,1,1)  1l8
016789 = diag(1,1, 1,1)  1l8
01 = diag(1,1,1, 1)  1l8

where 1l8 is the 8  8 identity matrix. setting p 0 = e we can then rewrite (9) as

{q, q} = diag(e  1, e  2, e  3, e  4)  1l8

where

5

1 = q2 + q5 + q
2 = q2 + q5  q
3 = q2  q5 + q
4 = q2  q5  q

5

5

5

6

(11)

(12)

(13)

since {q, q} is a positive matrix we have the bps bound e  i for i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

if there is only one non-zero charge, q2 say, then the bps bound is simply e  |q2|
and when it is saturated 1/2 of the supersymmetry is preserved. for example, for bps

membranes (with q2 positive and e = q2) we have

{q, q} = diag(0, 2q2, 2q2, 0)  1l8
the preserved supersymmetry parameters satisfy 01 = .

(14)

with an additional non-zero charge q5, the bps bounds are the two conditions that
e  |q2 + q5| and e  |q2  q5|. when either of the bounds is saturated, 1/4 of the
supersymmetry is preserved. for example, for a membrane and a vebrane,

{q, q} = diag(0, 2q2, 2(q2 + q5), 2q5)  1l8

(15)

with 8 zero eigenvalues. the supersymmetry preserved is the intersection of that pre-

served by each of the membranes and vebranes; in this case

01 = 012345 = 

(16)

adding the vebrane to the membrane further halved the membranes supersymme-

tries to leave 1/4 supersymmetry. however, a second vebrane can now be added in the

16789 directions without breaking any more supersymmetry, as the corresponding pro-

jection 016789 =  on the supersymmetry parameter is already implied by the conditions

(16). we can indeed add a third positive charge q

5 and preserve all 8 supersymmetries

if the energy saturates the bps bound, e = q2 + q5 + q

5. we will refer to this as the

usual bps intersection of the (2, 5, 5) system as it has been extensively studied in the
literature. an identical analysis goes through for (2, 5, 5) if we take e = q2  q5  q
5,
for (2, 5, 5) if we take e = q2 + q5  q
5 and for (2, 5, 5) if we take e = q2  q5 + q
5;
in each case, we can start with any two of the branes intersecting and preserving 1/4

supersymmetry, and then add the third for free without any further breaking.

returning to the (2, 5) system preserving 8 supersymmetries, adding an anti-vebrane
with 016789 =  instead of a vebrane to give the (2, 5, 5) conguration would appear
to break the original 8 supersymmetries of the membrane-vebrane system, but, as we

shall show, the bps bound leads to 8 supersymmetries if the energy saturates the bound.

7

(these will be a dierent 8-dimensional subset of the 32 for some values of the charges and
will be the same 8 for other values.) the situation is the same for the (2, 5, 5), (2, 5, 5)
and (2, 5, 5) systems; in each case any two of the three branes preserve 8 supersymme-

tries, while the third brane appears to break these 8 supersymmetries, but nonetheless 8

supersymmetries would be preserved if the bound is saturated. moreover, if such a 1/4

supersymmetric bps state exists, tuning the charges to particular values enhances the

number of supersymmetries to 16 or to the exotic value of 24.

for general charges it is useful to contrast the analysis for congurations related by
switching branes with anti-branes and we will focus on the (2, 5, 5) and (2, 5, 5) systems.
with this in mind we return to (12) and (13) and rst consider the (2, 5, 5) case in which

all the charges are positive. clearly 1 = q2 + q5 + q
the bps bound is e  q2 + q5 + q
5 and when it is saturated we preserve 1/4 of the
supersymmetry; this is the usual case considered above. to analyse the (2, 5, 5) case in

5 is the largest eigenvalue and hence

which all charges are negative, it is useful to rewrite (13) as

5

1 = q2 + q5 + q
2 = (q2 + q5 + q
3 = (q2 + q5 + q
4 = (q2 + q5 + q

5) + 2q

5

5) + 2q5

5) + 2q2

(17)

one of 2, 3, 4 is now the biggest eigenvalue and is positive, since 1 is negative and

the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. for example, when

0  q5  q
5,

0  q5  q2

(18)

it is 2 that is the biggest and the bps bound is e  (q2 + q5 + q
is saturated

5) + 2q5. if this bound

{q, q} = diag(2(q2 + q

5), 0, 2(q5  q

5), 2(q5  q2))  1l8

(19)

and 1/4 of the supersymmetry would be preserved. to obtain exotic preservation of 1/2

or 3/4 supersymmetry we only need to tune the charges: 1/2 supersymmetry is preserved

when either q5 = q

5 or q5 = q2 and 3/4 supersymmetry is preserved when q5 = q

5 = q2.

8

thus, for the (2, 5, 5) system with charges satisfying (18), the lowest energy allowed

by supersymmetry is e = (q2 + q5 + q
has this energy, then it would preserve 1/4 supersymmetry for generic values of the

5) + 2q5. if the ground state of this system indeed

charges, but when two of the charges are equal, 1/2 supersymmetry would be preserved

and if all three charges are equal, 3/4 supersymmetry would be preserved. similar results

follow for the cases in which it is 3 or 4 that is the biggest.

to obtain further insight, we continue with the case with charges satisfying (18), so

that 2 is the largest eigenvalue. the specic 8 supersymmetries that would be preserved
is the same as that preserved by the two intersecting branes (2, 5). it is interesting that it

is these two branes that are contributing to the energy positively while the other vebrane
is contributing negatively. recall that if we add a vebrane, with q5 positive, to (2, 5) to
obtain the (2, 5, 5) conguration, the usual case of preservation of 1/4 supersymmetry
is obtained if we have e = (q2 + q
5) + q5. the new point here is that we can add
instead an anti-vebrane, with q5 negative, to get the (2, 5, 5) system and still preserve
the same supersymmetry if again e = (q2 + q
5 and q5  q2. in
either case, the naive energy would just be the sum of the energies of the three branes,
i.e. en = |q2| + |q5| + |q
5|. this is the correct result for the usual 1/4 supersymmetric
(2, 5, 5) case, but for the exotic (2, 5, 5) case the energy of a state saturating the bound
would be e = en  v where v = 2|q5|, suggesting that v might be interpreted as some
kind of binding energy or as some tachyonic contribution.

5) + q5, as long as q5  q

finally, note that if the conditions (18) are not both satised, then either 3 or 4 will
be the largest eigenvalue and adding the anti-vebrane to (2, 5) will break the original 8

supersymmetries and lead to a dierent 8 supersymmetries being preserved.

3.2 tachyon condensation

it is perhaps worth comparing the above with the case of coincident brane/anti-brane

pairs. it has been argued that m d-branes and m anti-d-branes will completely annihilate
to leave the vacuum with energy e = mt + mt  v = 0 where t is the energy of a single
brane and the contribution v = 2mt arises from the negative potential energy released

by tachyon condensation [13, 14]. duality then implies that this should also apply to any

9

m brane/anti-brane pairs in m-theory or string theory, which should again completely

annihilate. the tachyon condensation reduces the energy to the minimum allowed by the

bps bound, which in this case is zero as the brane/anti-brane pair carries no net charge.

adding a further n branes to obtain n + m branes and m anti-branes, the m anti-branes

should completely annihilate m of the branes to leave n branes with energy e = nt ,
which can be written as e = en  v where en = (2m + n)t is the naive energy given
by the sums of the energies of the individual branes and anti-branes and v = 2mt .

then for two coincident p-branes of charges q, q, the naive energy of the system would
be the sum of the energies of the respective branes, en = |q| + |q|. this is the correct
energy if q, q have the same sign, so that they are either both branes or both anti-branes.

however, if the charges have opposite sign so that one is a brane and the other an anti-
brane (e.g. q = (n + m)t and q = mt for the case above), the resulting conguration
has e = |q + q| = en  v with v = 2 min(|q|,|q|).

this is suggestively similar to the case considered above when 2 is the largest eigen-
value. the (2, 5) system enters the energy formulae in exactly the same way as a 5-brane
of charge q5 = (q2 + q
5) would. adding a vebrane with positive charge q5 gives a
system with e = q5 + q5, while adding an anti-vebrane with negative charge q5 = q
gives a system with e = q5  q and v = 2q. this suggests that tachyon condensation
could play a role here also, reducing the energy below the sum of the brane energies. it

seems plausible that this could indeed be the case and that it reduces the energy to the

minimum allowed by supersymmetry.

3.3 string-theory

the m-theory example with an m2-brane and two m5-branes is related by duality to

many other congurations of three branes in string theory or m-theory. for example, it

is related to the type ii conguration of a dp-brane, a d(8-p) brane and a fundamental

string intersecting in a point, with the dp-brane in the directions 1, 2, ..., p, the d(8-p)

brane in the directions p + 1, p + 2, ..., 8 and the fundamental string in the 9th direction,

or to the conguration of a d5-brane in the 12345 directions, a ns5-brane in the 12678

directions and a d3-brane in the 129 directions studied by hanany-witten [15].

in

10

each case there is the usual 1/4 supersymmetric conguration in which one of the three

branes is added for free, and an exotic conguration obtained from this by reversing

the orientation of one of the branes, or of all three branes, in which a bps state would

preserve 1/4 supersymmetry for generic charges and 1/2 or 3/4 supersymmetry when

two or three of the charges are of equal magnitude. there are no such congurations

with only d-branes, so that the methods of [13, 14] cannot directly be used to test the

possibility of tachyon condensation leading to exotic bps states.

4 conclusion

we have shown that the supersymmetry algebra allows congurations preserving exotic

amounts of supersymmetry and we have identied simple congurations of charges in

m-theory and in eld theories such that any state with the lowest energy allowed by su-

persymmetry would preserve 3/4 supersymmetry, but we have not been able to establish

whether or not such states actually occur. we have been unable to nd any supersym-
metric supergravity solutions corresponding to the (2, 5, 5) system, or the congurations

obtained from this by chains of dualities. we have also been unable to nd any 3/4

supersymmetric classical non-trivial solutions of the wess-zumino model, even though

supersymmetry would have allowed such a solution [12].

in each of our examples, there are no spatial dimensions that are transverse to all the

branes and in such situations a number of subtleties can arise, but nonetheless our analysis

does recover the known cases of supersymmetric intersections. the congurations we have

identied are parameterised by three charges. for generic values of these charges, a bps

state would preserve 1/4 supersymmetry, but for special values when two or three of the

charges are equal, a bps state would preserve 1/2 or 3/4 supersymmetry, respectively.

we have conjectured that in string theory and m-theory, tachyon condensation could

play a role in reducing the energy to the minimum allowed by the bps bound, just as it

does for the brane/anti-brane pair.

it would be very interesting to either establish that such exotic states do occur in

certain theories, or, if they dont exist, to understand the reason for this, given that

supersymmetry appears to allow them. we hope to return to these issues in the future.
