abstract

a general form of multichannel bethe-salpeter equation is considered.
a set of relations which may be helpful in approximate treatments is
given. an example of extracting useful information from the equations is
discussed: we consider the most general trilinear coupling of n dierent
scalar elds and obtain - in the ladder approximation - closed expressions
for the regge trajectories and their couplings to dierent channels in the
vicinity of  = 1. sum rules and an example containing non-obvious
symmetry are discussed. in contradistinction to the usual approach, our
coupled system of equations leads to the simultaneous solutions for all
four-point green functions (elastic and inelastic) appearing in a given
theory.

this work has been supported under the german-polish agreement on bilateral scientic and techno-

logical cooperation.

1

bethe-salpeter equation [1] has been widely applied in the studies of two body scat-
tering and bound state problems (an exhaustive review can be found in [2]; for more
recent applications see [3]). moreover it has been demonstrated ([4], [5] and references
therein) that exact bethe-salpeter formalism in the complex momentum space - together
with its analytical dependence on both complex energy and complex angular momentum
- follows from basic principles of massive qft such as locality, lorentz covariance and
spectral condition. a possibility of extension of this rigorous approach to theories of qcd-
type with discrete spectrum of composite particles (quarkonia, glueballs) appearing
as regge-type particles has been recently announced [5]. having in mind these impressive
eorts and developments it seems rather surprising that the general form of bethe-salpeter
equation for two-body multichannel problems has not been discussed. in this context let
us mention here that there are indications of both q q and gg content in glueballs [6] and
that two-body coupled channel 3-d formalism has been successfuly applied recently in
phenomenology of hadron interactions [7], [8].
it seems therefore appropriate to start
discussion of multichannel bethe-salpeter equations in the literature. our contribution
to this subject will be a discussion of some general properties of the solutions followed
by an example of the multichannel solution of the special problem i.e. nding positions
and couplings of regge poles in the vicinity of  = 1 in a theory with the most general
trilinear couplings of n dierent scalar elds. a generalization of bethe-salpeter equation
for the two body multichannel o-shell amplitude is formally straightforward:

m = b + b  g  m

(1)

2) with k1 + k2 = k

b, g, m being matrices in both continuous and discrete indices i.e. m  m (a, k1; b, k2|a, k
1;
b, k
2 denotes o-shell extrapolations of the scattering amplitude
for the process with incoming particles a and b with momenta k1 and k2 respectively and
outgoing a(k
2) is a two-particle irreducible
kernel and g, up to a constant factor, is multiplication of two, two-point green functions:

2). b  b(a, k1; b, k2|a, k

1) and b(k

1; b, k

1 + k

g(a, k1; b, k2|a, k

1; b, k

2)  gf (a, k1; a, k

1)gf (b, k2; b, k

2)4(k1  k

1)4(k2  k
2)

(2)

symbol  denotes matrix multiplication both in discrete and continuous indices. two-point
functions gf need not be diagonal in discrete indices. in such a manner we admit both
spinor propagators and eventual mixing of dierent elementary elds. if we had complete
knowledge of matrix functions b, g in the euclidean region done, and were able to solve
eqn.(1) there, then the basic principles of qft would guarantee [4], [5] that this solution
- analytically continued as a known function of invariants - yields all available in a given
theory information on the scattering matrix function m in the physical region. generally
none of these conditions is met and one has to rely on soundness of chosen scheme of
approximations. having this in mind we shall write below a few general relations which
in our opinion may be helpful at least as a consistency check of approximations. to begin
with, let us remind, that for a given b, g solution of eqn.(1) m{b, g} is given as:

or equivalently:

m{b, g} = [1  b  g]1  b

m{b, g} = b  [1  g  b]1

2

(3)

(4)

this solution, treated as a functional of b and g has the following interesting property:
for arbitrary g1 one has

m{b, g} = m{m{b, g  g1}, g1}

(5)

this equality has been found useful for 1-channel problem long time ago [9].
in fact
equation (5) comes as an answer to the following question: what is the relation between
pairs (b, g) and (b1, g1) if both of them lead to the same m :

m{b, g} = m{b1, g1}

using eqns.(3), (4), (6) we get b1 = b + b  [g  g1]  b1 i.e.
b1 = m{b, g  g1}; inserting it into (6) we end up with relation (5).

(6)

from (1) we have

eqn.(5) leads to the following formula for g = g1 + g2 + g3 + ... + gn,

m{b, g} = m{...m{m{m{b, g1}, g2}, g3}..., gn}

(7)

it is natural to ask whether similar formula holds in the situation, when we subdivide b
instead of g. the answer is yes, once we notice that the following relations between o-
shell scattering amplitude m{b, g} and non-amputed 4-point green function m{g, b}
hold:
(8)

(9)

(10)

m{b, g} = b + b  m{g, b}  b
m{g, b} = g + g  m{b, g}  g
inserting (7) with g  b in r.h.s. of (8) we get for b = pn

k=1 bk,

m{b, g} = b + b  m{...m{m{m{g, b1}, b2}, b3}..., bn}  b

the formulae (7 - 10) may provide useful schemes of approximation for subdivision
of green functions and irreducible bethe-salpeter kernels. of course in principle these
two schemes can be combined. let us mention that approaches with suitable divisions
of g and/or b have already been useful both in the case of qed applications [10] and
for deriving rigorous results concerning threshold behaviour in qft [11]. the essential
relation found in [11] exhibits convenience of using half-amputed amplitudes and kernels
bh, mh:

mh = m{b, g}  g, bh = b  g

for this case formula (1) yields mh = m{bh , 1}. moreover, from eqn.(8)

m{1, bh} = 1 + m{bh, 1}

(11)

(12)

using division of bh in m{1, bh} together with eqns.(5),(12) we recover in our notation
bros-iagolnitzer relation (compare text before eqn.(5) of ref.[11]):

(1 + m  g) = (1 + m   g)  (1  b  g  (1 + m   g))1

(13)

where m = m{b, g}, m  = m{b  b, g}.
in this note we shall not investigate in detail how useful our eqns.(7), (10) are in practice.

3

we shall pass instead to a problem where the use of multichannel approach itself can
be clearly exhibited and discussed in qft. we illustrate this on an example of theory
with trilinear couplings. the most general trilinear coupling of n hermitian scalar elds,
i(i = 1, ..., n ) is of the form:

lint(x) =

1
3!

n

xi,j,k=1

cijk:i(x)j (x)k(x):

(14)

the totally symetric symbol cijk denotes the coupling constants.

let us start with the o-shell amplitude:

t (q1, i1; q3, i3|q2, i2; q4, i4) = (2)4(q1 + q3  q2  q4)m i1i2

i3i4 (ptot, q13, q24)

(15)

with ptot = q1 + q3 = q2 + q4 and qij = qiqj
the bethe-salpeter equation for m i1i2

.

i3i4 (ptot, q13, q24) in the ladder approximation reads:

m i1i2

i3i4 (ptot, q13, q24) = bi1i2

i3i4 (q13, q24) +xj,k z d4qbi1j
i3k(q13, q) = pi ci1ijci3ik/[(q13  q)2  m2

where  is the angle between ~q13 and ~q24.

in what follows we shall simplify the notation, introducing an index i(r, s) character-

izing the channel (r, s), i. e.

and dene matrices mij , bij and gij by

if the  product for two such matrices is dened explicitly by

n 2

xk=1z dq0 d|~q | xik(k0,|~k|, q0,|~q |)ykj (q0,|~q |, q0,|~q|)

then the bethe-salpeter equation for the partial wave amplitudes is of the form (1),

m = b + b  g  m

,

,

(24)

(25)

(26)

with the solution (4):

m = b 

1

1  g  b

= m{b, g}

.

here, one may split b according to (21)into terms corresponding to the exchange of

particles of type r,

b =

n

xr=1

b(r)



,

(27)

b(r)
i(i,j)i(k,l) = 2cirkcjrlq(r). in this way we are naturally led to a decomposition of
the form (10). thus, m can be written as

m = b + b  m{. . . m{m{g, b(1)

 }, b(2)

 }, . . . , b(n )



}  b

.

(28)

this form of the solution may be useful for numerical studies of m because the contribu-
tions of the various exchanged particles are now disentangled in a systematic way.

we will in the following focus our interest on regge trajectories near  = 1; such
a choice seems sound once we recall that studies of this singularity in 3 theory (i. e.
only c111 6= 0 in eq. (14)) often were and still are a point of departure for studies of the
diractive region in qcd (see, e. g. [12]). in our discussion we shall not go beyond the
approximation of leading logarithms which means thatin analogy with the one-channel
case [13]q can be replaced by its leading -plane singularity, q()  1/( + 1). in
this case, the matrix b becomes constant,

(29)

so that

m = 2c 

1

 + 1 + 2g  c

.

(30)

now, since c does not depend on the variables that are integrated by the  product, (30)
simplies to give a usual matrix equation: one nds

c  g  c = 
and so on, with the diagonal matrix f given by

j(ptot, q)  i(i,j)i(k,l)fi(i,j)(w )

.

(32)

5

therefore, the solution of the bethe-salpeter equation is

m = 2c

1

 + 1  fc

.

(33)

here everything is to be understood as a matrix relation. we will in the following study
the high-energy behavior of the amplitude in the crossed channel. to do this, we dene
the symmetric matrix c = fcf and write (33) in the form

m = 2f

1 c

f

.

 + 1  c
tot  0 so that fij comes out to be real and
positive.
since c is symmetric, we can diagonalize it: let v[i] denote the normalized eigenvectors,

we shall limit our considerations to p 2

(34)

then

cv[i] = [i]v[i]

,

i = 1, . . . , n 2

,

m = 2f

.

thus, the regge trajectories are given by

[i] = pole = [i]  1 .

(35)

(36)

(37)

with (36) we are ready to use the mandelstam-sommerfeld-watson representation [13,
14, 15] to obtain the high-energy amplitude in the crossed channel (t = (q1 + q3)2 = w 2
xed, s = (q1  q2)2  ), with the result

the states v[i] are eigenstates of the hermitian matrix c, thus they are orthogonal.
v[i]. as the dual base for these states

this is, however, no longer true for the states f
we introduce the states

1

u[i] = fv[i] with u[i]f1u[j] = ij

.

(39)

the only matrix elements of m = mpoles in this base that are non-zero are u[i]mu[i], i =
1, . . . , n 2. the high-energy behaviour of each of these matrix elements is governed by
only one trajectory,

u[i]mu[j] = ij[i]s[i]1

,

(40)

although the states u[i] are in general not orthogonal. equation (40) leads to the following
sum rules for the scattering amplitudes:

n 2

v[j]

j pfi fj mij = ij[i]s[i]1

.

(41)

note that some of these relations simplify whenever [i] = 0. in this case,

mu[i] = 0 for [i] = 0

(42)

(or equivalently cu[i] = 0), i. e. states corresponding to xed regge singularities are
transparent in our approximation.

as an illustration, let us consider the interaction

(43)

which is a special case of (14) for n = 2, 1 = , 2 = , and c112 = c121 = c211 = g1,
c222 = g2, c111 = c122 = c212 = c221 = 0. let i(1, 1) = 1, i(2, 2) = 2, i(1, 2) = 3, and
i(2, 1) = 4, then the matrix c is block diagonal due to symmetry of total lagrangian with

of course, these relations are only valid in the regge limit s  , t xed, and apply
only to regge behaviour, so that a vanishing combination of amplitudes means that this
combination does not exhibit regge behaviour.

in the example, eigenvalues [i] can vanish only for g2 = g1. if, say, g2 = g1 (i. e.
1f3, [4] = 0), the relations (48)  (53) simplify to

1(f1 + f2), [2] = 0, [3] = 2g2

(54)

if moreover, we assumed m = m, then [1] = [3] and all the amplitudes standing on
the l.h.s. of (54) are the same. this symmetry can be traced back to the fact, that for
g1 = g2  g we can rewrite eqn.(43) as a sum of two separate 3

in the special case m = m total lagrangian can be separated into two of identical form
and hence the complete symmetry follows.

we are indebted to professors jacques bros and wojciech krolikowski for the stimu-

lating correspondence and discussions.
