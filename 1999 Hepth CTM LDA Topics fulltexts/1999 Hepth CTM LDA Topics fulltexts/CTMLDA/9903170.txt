(6.26) straightforward generalization (4.9). rst line gives coupling target metric antisymmetric tensor, second line generalizes topological term f appearing (4.9). now, general, latter separately gauge invariant (not even total divergence). rather, gauge symmetry hidden, follows considering terms action. check expression (6.26) correct, also determine functional form dual metric ab(g) antisymmetric tensor ab(g), apply dirac procedure recover hamiltonian description. analysis essentially semiabelian case. following , let us parametrize g group elements n variables, denote i; g = g(i). momenta conjugate variables = (g1 g )j (cid:18)j ab(g)(g1d0g)b j ab(g)(g1d1g)b + j +a 1(cid:19) . right generators k obtained introducing matrices n j(g), dened ei = n j(g) g1 g j , 18 (6.27) (6.28) writing k = n j(g)j . result, get g k satisfy poisson brackets (6.13). (6.27), k = ab(g)(g1d0g)b ab(g)(g1d1g)b , analogy (5.4), get primary constraints k + 1 0 . (6.29) (6.30) (6.31) also, semiabelian case, additional primary constraints (5.5) stating momenta vanish. secondary, gauss law, constraints (5.6) become conjugate (gd1g)m + + f (g)m + b k b 0 , hamiltonian given h = 1 2 z dx ab(g) (cid:18)(g1d0g)a(g1d0g)b + (g1d1g)a(g1d1g)b(cid:19) use (6.30) reexpress (g1d0g)a h terms phase space coordinates. (6.32) (6.33) let us proceed constraint analysis. semiabelian case, nondynamical, thus may eliminated 0 constraints (6.31), along 1 going constrained surface. introduce dirac variables k g, 0 may strongly set equal zero. 0, form second class set, eliminated k = k ci j k j1 g = g (1) , 1 1 = e , (6.34) (1) takes values g assume weakly equal identity element. easily checked variables (weakly) zero poisson brackets (6.31) 0. moreover, algebra dirac variables identical k g. thus 1 cotangent bundle algebra preserved upon projecting onto constraint surface, recover (6.13). finally, note remaining set constraints (6.32) agree (6.19) upon using (6.31). hamiltonian (6.33) equivalent (6.18) provided dual metric antisymmetric tensor given expressions (4.14). now, course, f is, general, linear function scalar elds, rather given (6.15). note identity (4.15) still holds case. summarize, solution metric antisymmetric tensor (6.12) primary lagrangian expressed terms functions f (g), dual counterparts (4.14) expressed terms f (g). comparing expressions, see duality transformation corresponds g 1 g1 , f (g) f (g) . (6.35) 19 duality transformation coset theories is, however, involved this, since also requires replacing ordinary derivatives appearing primary lagrangian covariant derivatives (6.22) dual lagrangian, well as, including topological term. lagrangian (2.8) dual (6.26) valid pair (g, g) isotropic subgroups drinfeld double group gd, subgroup h g, provided restrictions (2.3), (2.4), (6.3) structure constants invariant metric g hold. conditions (2.3) (2.4) necessary already semiabelian case. condition (6.3) implied g subgroup h dimension dim = dim dim. curious end complimentary subgroups g g. formalism, however, h plays dierent role h, since gauged. course, provided metric g invertible block diagonal, reverse roles two subgroups, gauging h h. gauge group would linear action g, nonlinear one g. intriguing possibility would gauged part (i.e. subgroup) h part h. primary dual lagrangians would linear nonlinear realization full gauge symmetry.
