abstract

the topological antisymmetric tensor eld theory in n-dimensions
is perturbed by the introduction of local metric dependent interaction
terms in the curvatures. the correlator describing the linking number
between two surfaces in n-dimensions is shown to be not aected by
the quantum corrections.

1 introduction

since their introduction [1, 2], topological eld theories have been object of
continuous and renewed investigations and have led to many interesting ap-
plications [3]. their original motivation was to provide a natural framework
for a eld theory characterization and computation of several topological
invariants. for instance, the chern-simons and the bf theories in three di-
mensions play a relevant role in knots theory, their correlation functions being
respectively related to the jones [2] and the alexander-conway [5] polyno-
mials. in particular, a generalization of this framework to higher dimensions
allows to describe the linking number of surfaces in terms of antisymmetric
tensor elds, whose action reads [6, 7]

stop =zm

bdc ,

(1.1)

where b and c are forms of degree p and n  p  1 respectively. indeed, it
is possible to show [6, 7] that the correlation function

*zp

bz

np1

c+stop

= link(, )

(1.2)

gives the linking number between two smooth, closed nonintersecting sur-
faces p and 
np1. it is worth underlining also that, more recently, much
attention has been given to the fact that topological terms of the kind of
(1.1) appear frequently as parts of more general eective actions describing
the low-energy dynamics of several eld theory models. for instance, the
eective action corresponding to the bosonization [8] of relativistic three-
dimensional massive fermionic systems at t = 0 can be written as the sum

of a chern-simons termr bdb and of an innite series of higher order terms

in the curvature db and its derivatives. the same procedure can be applied
when fermions are coupled to a dynamical vector eld c. in this case the
resulting bosonized action contains a mixed term of the type of (1.1). these
eective actions are well suited to describe several three-dimensional phe-
nomena such as the fermi-bose transmutation [9], the quantum hall eect
[8], the incompressible chiral liquids [10, 11].

1

further interesting examples are provided by the low energy eective su-
pergravities studied in the context of the ads/cf t correspondence [12].
indeed, as discussed by [13], the dual supergravity action which describes
the n = 4 sym theory with electric and magnetic uxes is

ssugra =zx

brrdbn s + s(db) ,

(1.3)

where brr, bn s are the ramond-ramond and neveu-schwarzneveu-
schwarz two forms, transforming as a doublet under the sl(2, z) s-duality
symmetry, x is a negatively curved ve-dimensional einstein manifold, and
s(db) collects all the higher order terms in the curvatures dbrr, dbn s.
in all these models, the topological terms appear together with higher deriva-
tives terms in the generalized curvatures, which depend on the metric. there-
fore we are naturally led to analyse the possible contributions coming from
these terms, as recently done for the three-dimensional abelian chern-simons
theory [14]. in this case it has been possible to prove that the correlator

az2

a(cid:29) = link(1, 2) ,

(1.4)

(cid:28)z1
terms of the typer f n.

describing the linking number between two smooth closed nonintersecting
curves 1, 2, is not aected by the presence of higher derivative interaction

the aim of the present work is that of generalizing this result to higher dimen-
sions. in particular we shall see that, in analogy with the three-dimensional
chern-simons, the correlator

*zp

bz

np1

c+(stop+sint)

= link(, ) ,

(1.5)

is not aected by the introduction of local perturbation terms in the curva-
tures of the type

sint =z (db)k(dc)q ,

(1.6)

and gives as nal result the linking number of the two surfaces , . this
result means that the correlator (1.5) is stable against the introduction of
perturbing local terms in the curvatures, regardless of their power-counting
nonrenormalizability.

2

it is worth underlining that we will limit here ourselves only to eective
actions which are abelian, and we shall consider only terms dependent on the
curvatures hb = db, hc = dc which can be treated as true perturbations.
namely, we shall avoid in the eective action (stop + sint) the inclusion of a
term of the maxwell type

sm ax =

1

mbzm

hb  hb +

1

mczm

hc  hc ,

(1.7)

where mb, mc are mass parameters. the presence of this term would com-
pletely modify the original properties of the model. in fact, being expression
(1.7) quadratic in the gauge elds, it cannot be considered as a true pertur-
bation term, as it will be responsible for the presence of massive excitations
in the spectrum of the theory. rather, the presence of the maxwell term in
the eective action (stop + sint) will give rise to the existence of two distinct
regimes corresponding to the long and short distance behaviors, respectively.
for distances larger than the inverse of the mass parameters mb, mc (i.e.,
the low energy regime ), the topological term will prevail, while the maxwell
term will become the relevant one at short distances (i.e., the high-energy
regime).
in general, the computation of the correlator (1.2) for arbitrary
surfaces in the presence of the maxwell term is a very dicult task, mainly
due to the metric dependence of the propagator.
indeed, in the abelian
three-dimensional maxwell-chern-simons case no closed analytic expression
for the correlator (1.4) has been found so far, even in the simpler case in
which the curves 1, 2 are two circles. the inclusion of the maxwell term
is beyond the aim of the present paper, being presently under investigation.
we would like to remark that, in the low energy regime, a useful local gauge
invariant eld redenition has been recently applied [15] for the maxwell-
chern-simons theory to compute the corrections to the correlator (1.4) for
two coinciding curves 1  2 as power series in the inverse of the mass. this
eld redenition can be also generalized to the present case and is expected
to be suitable for the characterization of the maxwell contributions in the
low energy regime [16].

grams

in order to analyse the aforementioned nonrenormalization properties of the
linking number, let us proceed by computing the correlator

*zp

np1

c+sef f

,

(2.8)

in the case in which the total action s is chosen to be

sef f = stop + sint ,

sint = zm

: (hb  hb)  (hc  hc) :

(2.9)

where  is an arbitrary parameter with negative mass dimension, and hb =
db, hc = dc are respectively the curvatures of the gauge elds b and c.
notice that the normal ordering prescription has been adopted for the quartic
interaction, allowing us to rule out tadpoles diagrams1.
the action s is invariant under the gauge transformations

b = dp1 ,
c = dnp2 .

(2.10)

remark that the transformations (2.10) are reducible and therefore the quan-
tization procedure will require the introduction of ghosts for ghosts. in order
to gauge x the action (2.9) we choose the linear landau tansverse condition

d  b = d  c = 0 ,

(2.11)

which implies that the whole set of ghosts for ghosts completely decouples,
due to the abelian character of the theory. thus, for the propagator we get

(cid:10)b1...p(x)cp+1...n1(y)(cid:11)bc = 1......n1nn

1we remind the reader that, in the present abelian case, the normal-ordering pre-
scription is compatible with the requirement of gauge invariance. this follows from the
observation that the positive and negative-frequency parts of the eld-strengths related to
the gauge elds c and b are each gauge invariant.

x g(x  y) ,

(2.12)

where g(x  y) is the green function of the laplacian

d  dg(x  y) = (x  y) .

since the two surfaces ,  must be homologically trivial [6]

p = p+1, 

np1 = np ,

we can suppose that they are contained in a region of m dieomorphic to
the at euclidean space2 rn. in this case, the green function is given by

g(x  y) =

 (n/2)

[(2n  4) n/2p! (n  p  1)!]

|x  y|n2 ,

where |x  y| denotes the euclidean distance between x and y. let us now
give the elementary wick contractions which shall be needed for the evalua-
tion of the feynman diagrams. from (2.12) we obtain

(p  1)!

(cid:16)1...np11...pp+1p+1

 (x  y)(cid:17) .

(2.15)

2actually, there are some counterexamples of surfaces which are homologically trivial
but cannot be contained in a region dieomorphic to rn [6], but we do not consider these
particular cases here.

notice that the propagator dcehbe has the same structure of dbehce in
(2.13). in the above equations ehc = hc and ehb = hb are respectively

the hodge duals of the curvatures hc and hb, and the symbol [1, ..., p]
means complete antisymmetrization in the indices.
concerning now the perturbative expansion, it is easy to see that the rst
feynman diagram which contributes to the correlation function (2.8) is of
in which ,  are two
two-loop order. for the three-dimensional case,
smooth oriented nonintersecting curves, this diagram can be drawn as follows

figure 1: 2-loop contribution

in the above gure, the dashed, the wavy and the double lines refer respec-

tively to the wick contractionsdbehce ,dcehbe anddehbehce.

6

apart from an irrelevant global symmetry coecient, the feynman integral
corresponding to the diagram of f ig.1 is given by

i (2) = z

(2.16)

in the analysis of the above expression it is worth to observe that the two
elds b(x) and c(y), lying on the hypersurfaces  and , are respectively

tive on the closed hypersurface ; implying that this term gives a vanishing
contribution. the same result also holds for the contribution coming from

wick-contracted with ehc and ehb. from the explicit form of the propagator
dbehce, we see that the term in the second line of (2.13) yields a total deriva-
the propagatordcehbe of (2.14). it is worth remarking that this argument

relies only on the fact that the two surfaces  and  are closed. therefore,
it applies to the higher-order contributions as well. as a consequence, all the
wick contractions entering the feynman diagrams will lead to a product of
delta functions. in particular, for the 2-loop diagram of f ig.1, the integral
(2.16) reduces to

i (2) = z d(x)1....pz d (y)1....np1z dnz1z dnz2

1....np1
[1....np1] (y  z2) 1....p

(2.17)

[1....p] (x  z1)

1....pbp+11....np1bp+1 (z1  z2) .

in spite of the presence of products of delta functions with the same argu-
ment, the above expression is easily seen to vanish. we observe rst of all
that it is always possible to take an order of integration over the delta func-
tions such that we end up with products of n(xy) and not of n (0). in the
present case, this would amount to integrate out rst the two delta functions
with arguments x  z1 and y  z2, leading to

7

i (2) = z d(x)1....pz d (y)1....np11....np1
1....p+11....np11....p+11....1....pbp+11....np1
p+1 (x  y) p+1 (x  y) bp+1 (x  y) ,

[1....np1]1....p

[1....p]

(2.18)

which is zero owing to the fact that the two surfaces  and  never intersect,
so that x  y never vanishes. moreover, as done in [14], we can adopt a more
rigorous treatment by regularizing the n-dimensional delta functions with
coinciding arguments through the point splitting procedure already used by
polyakov [9]

(z1  z2) =

1

(2)n/2 e|z1z2|2/2

lim
0

(z1  z2) = (z1  z2)

(2.19)

more precisely, whenever a product of m delta functions with coinciding
arguments occurs, it will be understood as

[ (z1  z2)]m = [ (z1  z2)]m1  (z1  z2) ,

where the limit   0 is meant to be taken at the end of all calculations. in
this regularization scheme we then have

i (2) = lim

0z d(x)1....pz d (y)1....np1z dnz1z dnz2

1....np1
[1....np1](y  z2)1....p

(2.20)

[1....p] (x  z1)

1....pbp+11....np1bp+1 (z1  z2) ,

which is vanishing no matter the order of integration we take. indeed, before
taking the limit   0, we always obtain an expression containing  (x  y),
with x  y 6= 0. we can thus conclude that the two-loop diagram in f ig.1
does not contribute to the correlator (2.8).
similar arguments can be used to show that also the higher-order contribu-
tions vanish. let us consider, for instance, the topologically distinct dia-
grams contributing to the 3 and 4-loop order, shown respectively in f ig.2
and f igs.3, 4.

(2.22)

integrating over z1 and z2, and after regularizing the product of delta func-
tions with coinciding arguments, we obtain

(2.24)

all terms in all possible diagrams may then be seen to be proportional to
the n-dimensional delta function  (x  y) or its derivatives. one may easily
convince oneself that this mechanism also applies to any order in perturbation
theory. since we always have x 6= y, these diagrams all amount to a null
correction to the basic diagram, so that the correlation function (2.8) gives
the generalized linking number of  and

3 conclusion

we have been able to prove that the correlator (2.8) is unaected by radia-
tive corrections to all orders, provided that  and  are two smooth closed
nonintersecting surfaces. although we have carried out explicit computa-
c, the same result may be achieved

straightforwardly for any local interaction containing arbitrary powers of the

that obtained in the case of two nonintersecting curves [14], may be inter-
preted as a kind of nonrenormalization property of the linking number in
higher dimensions.
