in our short paper we join quintessence cosmological scenarios with the

duality simmetry existing in string dilaton cosmologies. actually, we consider

only the tracker potentials v = v0/ and show that duality is established if

 = 2.

in this short letter we show that duality simmetry is also present in the so - called

quintessence theories.

duality (see the recent review paper on this topic by gasperini (1999) and the almost

complete references therein) is an extra - simmetry existing (in the cosmological arena : we

will use a standard 3+1 friedmann - robertson - walker splitting of spacetime, i.e. the cos-

mological principle) in the minisuperspace associate with scalar - theories of gravity (see [2]

and the references therein). essentially this simmetry is such that if a(t) is a cosmological

solution, then a1(t) is also a solution if the scalar eld (dilaton) present in this approach
to gravity undergoes to the trasformation    =   3
implies the existing of a new fundamental constant s, i.e. the fundamental string scaling.

2 ln a. of course this simmetry

the reason of the great interest in string theory is very well described in the quoted paper

by gasperini and we make reference to it for a discussion on this topic.

the second ingredient we discuss in our paper is quintessence, which (in few words)

has been developed recently [1], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] because the astronomical observations

suggest that there is present in the universe a very large amount of energy density with a

negative pressure. we may consider it as given by a scalar eld  slowly rolling down its

potential and such that 1 < w < 0, where w = p/, being p and  the pressure
and the energy density of the scalar eld. actually recent considerations [7] x this interval

to be smaller :1 < w  0.6.
resuming, generalizing and suitably readapting older ideas on cosmology with a scalar eld

1 as a matter of fact, quintessence has been advanced

(scalar - tensor theories of gravity). one of the most common potential used in quintessence

theories is of the type v = v0, v0,  > 0, are parameters; their discussion can be found

in the literature already quoted, but see also [3] because we are going to analyse quintessence

in a non - minimal coupled theory.

1we like to remember that a cosmological constant  which can be connected with vacuum energy

density has w = 1.

3

these are the two ingredients we are going to join in what follows.

we will refer to the general string action :

s =

1

d1

s

z dd+1xge2[r + 4()2 + v ()] +z dd+1xglm ,

(1)

where lm rapresents all the others matter source; the antisymmetric tensor b present in

the string theory has been taken zero as usual in string cosmology; nally, we will assume

d = 3.

let us consider cosmological non - minimally coupled models described by the general

action :

a = z d4xg(cid:26)(cid:20)f () + r +


2

()2  v ()(cid:21) + lm(cid:27)

(2)

and suppose that in (1), as well as in (2), lm = 0, that is let us consider a situation in

which there are no sources other than the scalar eld. furthermore we have introduced a

generic coecient  in the kinetic part because of the discrepance existing, on this coecient,

between (1) and the non - minimal coupled scalar - tensor action. from (2), in the frw case,

we get, dened in the minisuperspace, the point - like lagrangian :

a(cid:19)2
l = a3"6f ()(cid:18) a

+ 6f () (cid:18) a

a(cid:19) +


2

2  v ()# .

let us choose the potential commonly used in the quintessence approach, i.e. :

v = v0

1
 ,

(3)

(4)

being  arbitrary and greater than zero. 2 let us change   0e. then v  v0
furthermore, we write the coupling as :

0

e.

f = f0e2f () ,

(5)

2we do not enter in details on the way of putting constraints on this parameter because the goal

of our paper is dierent; in any case see [5].

4

being (f0, 0, ) constants and f () a generic function of the  - eld. using this new

variables and functions, lagrangian (3) becomes :

a(cid:19)2
l = a3e2"6f0f (cid:18) a

+ 6f0(2f + f )()(cid:18) a

a(cid:19) +

(6)

the prime indicates derivation with respect to .

let us now perform the standard transformation :

 = (a, ) = k +

ln a ,

(7)

where k is a new parameter. the piece

a3e2 = a3e2ke ln a3

= a3a3e(2k) ,

if  = 1, becomes a3a3e2 = e2k. substituting (7) in (6) gives :
l = e2k"(cid:18) a

let us require that f is a solution of the equation :

(9)

because of (7) we can choose as a particular solution of (9) f = f0; then, we have f0 = 2

0

which substituted in the coecient of ( a/a)2 gives :

l = e2k"

e(2)# .

if we now suppose that 0 = 8, k2 = 1,  = 1, we get :

a(cid:19)2
l = e2"3(cid:18) a

+ 4 2 + v0e(2)(a,)# ,

(10)

and we recover duality if  = 2. that is, duality simmetry requires that the quintessence

potential has to be v = v0/2
0.

5

it can be of some interest that it is not xed the sign of the scalar eld  appearing at

the exponent in (10) : this implies that    is a simmetry for the lagrangian l.

as conclusion, we like to remark that, as in standard string theory, we have f = const. v

in the string dilaton (non - minimally coupled) quintessence. furthermore, being :

 =

v v
(v )2

(11)

a relevant parameter in quintessence scenario [8], in the case of string quintessence we get :

 = 1 ,

(12)

that is, what is sucient to declare that the scalar eld present in the theory is, in reality, a

tracker solution [3], [8]. then for getting quintessence to join the duality simmetry connected

to string theory, we have to x  = 2.
