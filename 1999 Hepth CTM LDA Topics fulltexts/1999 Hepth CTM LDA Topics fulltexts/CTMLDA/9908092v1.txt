i. introduction

recently type 0 string theories attract much interest in the study of non-supersymmetric

gauge theories [16]. type 0 string theories can be obtained from the worldsheet of type ii

string theories by performing a non-chiral gso projection [4]. the resulting theories have

world sheet supersymmetry but no spacetime supersymmetry. the crucial dierence of type

0 theories with type ii theories is to have the doubling of ramond-ramond(rr) elds and

the tachyon.

one of the simplest way to see the role of tachyon in type 0 theories is to consider the

intersecting dp-branes. the dp-brane bound states can be intersected according to the

same rule of the type ii theories. the d5-d1 brane black hole was constructed to show
that the corresponding near-horizon geometry is ads3s3t4 and it has asymptotically
at space at innity [7]. this corresponds to the dilatonic solution. it is shown that the
tachyon eld can be stabilized only in the near-horizon of ads3s3t4. in our previous
work [8], we studied extensively the stability by analyzing the potentials surrounding the

d5-d1 brane black hole. in this paper, we nd the btz black hole as a non-dilatonic
solution from type 0b string theory [9]. this is a globally ads3s3 solution, which means
that it has asymptotically ads3 spacetime [10]. this is a crucial point that contrasts to the

d5-d1 brane black hole. here we wish to study whether the tachyon can propagate or
not on global ads3s3.

the organization of the paper is as follows.

in section ii, we obtain the btz black

hole in type 0b string theory. we set up the perturbation for all elds around this black

hole background in sec. iii. here we choose the harmonic gauge for graviton and use all

linearized equations including two bianchi identities to decouple (, t) from the remaining

elds. finally we discuss our results in sec. iv.

ii. btz black hole

we start with the appropriate truncation of the type 0b string theory in the string frame

ingredients are the tachyon(t ) and the doubling of the rr elds(f3). here  = 1 and g

is ten-dimensional string coupling constant. we wish to follow the mtw conventions [13].

here we are interested in non-dilatonic solution. we consider mainly the six-dimensional
part by parametrizing g10 = e6g6 + e2dxidxi, where 6 =   2. note the dierence
between  and 6. the former is the 10d dilaton and the latter is the 6d dilaton. hereafter

we set 6 to be zero, which means that

 = 2.

the black hole solution can be obtained by setting

e2  = g2, t = 0, f 2

3 = 0, r = 0.

with r2 = r1r5 and 63 is the six-dimensional hodge dual of 3. the ten-dimensional
indices m, n, p,   are split into , , ,   for the btz black hole (t, , ) and m, n, p,  
for s3(1, 2, 3). the background spacetime (ads3s3t4) is given by

iii. perturbation analysis

now we consider the perturbation around the 6d background of ads3s3 as in [12]

f3 = f3 + f3 = f3 {1 + f(t, , , 1, 2, 3)} ,
f3mnp = f3mnp + f3mnp = f3mnpn1 + f 
(t, , , 1, 2, 3)o ,
 =  + (t, , , 1, 2, 3),

gm n = gm n + hm n (t, , , 1, 2, 3),

t = 0 + t(t, , , 1, 2, 3).

here hm n is given by the block diagonal form [10,15]

hm n =

this seems to be general for our calculation.

one has to linearize (3), (7) and (6) in order to obtain the equations governing the

perturbations as

t + h
(cid:17) = 0.

(22)

(23)

(24)

now we attempt to disentangle the mixing between (, t) and other elds by using both the
harmonic gauge ( m hm p = 0, hm p = hm p  h
from (4) and (5)

q) and kalb-ramond equations

after some calculations, one nds the important relations

2 (f  t) (cid:16)ht

  t(cid:17) +(cid:16)ht

(cid:17)  hi

i + hi

i + hi

i = 0,

i = 0,

where hi

i = h1

3. from the bianchi identities (8) one has

1f = 2f = 3f = 0,
tf 

 = f 

 = f 

 = 0.

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

this implies that f = f(t, , ) are dynamical elds, f 
dynamical elds. hence we choose f 
result as

 = f 

(1, 2, 3) are non-

 = 0. then from (27) one obtains an important

t = 0,

(30)

which implies that the tachyon t is a non-propagating mode in the ads3s3 background.
on the other hand we nd f+ = f. plugging this with t = 0 into (24) leads to the fact
that (24) is trivially satised. using (26) and (27), eqs.(22) and (23) lead to

if hi

i = 0, then one nds

2(8  h) 
2
2 
r2 hi

4
r2 hi
i = 0.

i = 0,

h = 8,

2 = 0.

(31)

(32)

(33)

however this corresponds to the linearized equation for a minimally coupled scalar.

if

hi

i = a, then eqs.(31) and (32) lead to the same equation as

2 

2a
r2  = 0 with h = 6.

6

(34)

in order to nd a, we recall the relation in (9). the linearized version of eq.(9) implies

 = 2.

(35)

and then using gij = gij + hij, hi

i = 8 = 4. this implies a = 4. hence the nal equation

for the dilaton in the string frame takes the form

2 

8
r2  = 0.

(36)

this corresponds to the equation for a minimally coupled scalar with l = 2 on ads3s3
[16].

iv. discussions

a new feature of type 0b string theory is the presence of the tachyon. it is known that

while the minkowski vacuum is unstable in type 0 string theory, the near-horizon geometry
of ads5s5 should be a stable background for suciently small radius [6]. the rr elds
work to stabilize the tachyon in the near-horizon. it is clear from the d5-d1 brane black
hole [8] that the near-horizon of ads3s3t4 is stable because v(r) and vt(r) take the
shapes of the potential barrier. if there do not exist the rr elds (f,h), one nds a
potential well for the tachyon, which induces an instability in the near-horizon [17].

on the other hand, we nd that the tachyon cannot propagate on global ads3s3. this
background corresponds to a non-dilatonic solution. this means that the 10d dilaton()

plays no role in setting this background. however, the propagation of  is alive as shown in

eq.(36) and its absorption cross section was obtained in [10,16]. unfortunately, the tachyon

is not a propagating mode. this comes from the kalb-ramond equation, the gauge condition

and bianchi identities. in the s-wave(l = 0) calculation the propagation of tachyon is not

allowed. this contrasts to our naive expectation such that the tachyon is a propagating

mode in the type 0b string theory.

how we do interpret this non-propagation? this mainly due to the spacetime symmetry
of global ads3s3 background. we remind the reader that the ads3s3 background in type

7

iib theory is maximally supersymmetric [18]. although the type 0b theory is not super-
symmetric in spacetime, the ads3s3 has the global sl(2,r)lsl(2,r)rsu(2)lsu(2)r
group of isometries. these are part of an ads supergroup g=glgr, where both gl
and gr contain su(2)sl(2,r). this background is indistinguishable from their type iib
cousins [19]. it seems that these global symmetries prevent the tachyon from propagating
into ads3s3.

in conclusion, although the tachyon is a propagating and stable in the near-horizon
geometry(ads3s3) of the d5-d1 brane black hole, it is not a propagating mode on the
global ads3s3 background.
