(2.3) performing following transition (ea, ka, ka1, s) (iea, ika, ika1, (i)1a s) (2.4) index a. indeed, transformation preserves form matrix (2.2), element ea becomes time-like: e2 = 1. so, give basic derivations euclidean case, reformulating minkowski space nal analysis. follows (2.3) = x2, ka = eaea+1 = q e2 k2 a1. (2.5) thus, lagrangian appearing action (1.2) euclidean space replaced following one l = c0s + cq e2 3 k2 2 + p( x se1) +xi pi1( ei1 ki1ei + ki2ei2) xi,j dij (eiej ij ), (2.6) x, p, ei, pi1, s, ki, dij independent variables, i, j = 1, 2, 3. 3 perform legendre transformation lagrangian (referring details {$9905009$}). variables pi1 represent momenta conjugated ei1, whereas momenta conjugated (s, ki1, dij) lead trivial constraints ps 0, pi1 0, pij 0. (2.7) setting k3 6= 0 nd momentum conjugated e3 form taking account (2.5), get constraints p3 = c(cid:0) e2 3 k2 2(cid:1)1/2 e3. p3e3 0, p3e1 0, p2 3 (p3e2)2 c2 0. (2.8) (2.9) construction primary hamiltonian system becomes straightforward. simplify resulting system, one stabilize trivial primary constraints (2.7) exclude considerations, makes variables s, ki1, dij lagrangian multipliers. without loss generality one also impose gauge conditions (see details {$9905009$}) manipulations get hamiltonian system p3e2 0, p2e2 0, p2e1 0. = dp dx +pi dpi dei, h = s(pe1 c0) +pi ki1i1.i + k3 2c (p2 3 c2) +pi,j dij (eiej ij), primary constraints piej 0, j eiej ij 0, pe1 c0 0, i1.i pi1ei piei1 0, p2 variables s, ki, dij play role lagrangian multipliers. 3 c2 0, let us stabilize primary constraints (2.11)-(2.14). stabilization (2.11) gives following xation lagrangian multipliers dij : equations motion read 2di.j = k3ci.3j.3 sc01.i1.j, x = e1, e1 = k1e2, e2 = k1e1 + k2e3, e3 = k2e2 + k3p3/c p3 = k3ce3 k2p2, p2 = k1p1 + k2p3, p1 = sp + k1p2 + sc0e1, p = 0. (2.10) (2.11) (2.12) (2.13) (2.14) (2.15) (2.16) stabilizing remaining primary constraints, get following rst-stage secondary constraints pe2 0, p1e3 0, p3p2 0. (2.17) 4 ortogonality (ei, p3/c) p2, follows (2.14),(2.11),(2.17) conclude stabilizing rst second constraints (2.17) constraint (2.18), get p2 0. get k2 = qk1, k3 = sc0/cq2, p1 = qp3, 1/q pe3 c0 6= 0. p = c0e1 + c0e3/q + pp3, consistency equations motion (2.16) frenet equations implies p pp3/c2. ea = {ei, e4 p3/c} : eaeb = ab. (2.18) (2.19) (2.20) (2.21) (2.22) (2.23) (2.24) therefore, initial hamiltonian system formulated purely terms moving frame ea, coordinates x, momentum p, relations (2.24), (2.22) play role constraints. taking account constraint (2.22)), get expressions rotation generators: j = p x +xi pi ei = p (x qp3/c0) casimirs p2 = (cp)2 + c2 0(1 + 1/q2), w2 (p j)2 = 0. (2.25) (2.26) thus, system possesses zero spin despite dependence initial lagrangian higher derivatives. expression rotation generators (2.25) hints us introduce eective coordinate x x qp3/c0 : x = sp/c0, p = const (2.27) whose evolution equations look similar convenient relation velocity momentum massive particle (note, spite relations mass system equal c0). reduction initial hamiltonian system (2.10) constraints (2.24), (2.22), (2.20) leads following unconstrained system red = dp dx + c2 c0 dp dq, hred = sc2 c0 (cid:18)p2/2 + c2 0 2c2q2 p2 c2 2c2 (cid:19) . 0 external curvatures system related modular coordinate q follows k2 k1 = q, k3 = c0 cq2 , k 2 2 k3 k 2 1 = c0 c . (2.28) (2.29) so, system consideration possesses extended gauge invariance since trajectories ratio k1/k2 gauge equivalent. reducing system (2.28) p, exclude trivial part dynamics (2.27), get evolution parameter q described textbook mechanical system  dp dq, h0 = p2/2 + c2 0q2 , 2c2 p2 c2 2c2 0 . e = (2.30) 5 system immediately integrated classical level q2 = 0)s2 (p2 c2 2c2 + 2 p2 c2 0 , p2 > c2 0, well quantum one. thus, adding torsion term increases absolute value momenta system 0. system (2.30) known literature conformal respect torsionless system, p2 c2 mechanics, due symmetry action conformal transformations generated h0 = p2/2 + c2 0q2 , = pq, k = q2/2 . 2c2 (2.31) energy spectrum continuous lowest bound e = 0 normalizable. {$9811003$} conformal symmetry system used solving problem ground state. recently mechanism found adequate problem motion charged particle eld charged black hole . due observation interest conformal mechanics supergeneralizations , renewed context study probe d0-brane dynamics external d-brane eld (see e.g.{$9812034$} refs therein). conformal mechanics arises model dierent context: denes local gauge symmetry particle system. 3 transition minkowski space previous section constructed constrained hamiltonian system corresponding action (1.2) euclidean space. found evolution geometry system described terms non-relativistic conformal mechanics repulsive potential. purpose section consider relativistic aspects system, i.e. investigate model (1.2) minkowski space. mentioned beginning section 2, use results concerning euclidean case, since frenet formulae euclidean space transformed ones minkowski space use transition (2.4), denotes element moving frame becomes time-like, i.e. e2 = 1. correspondingly, transition time-like trajectories choose = 1, transition space-like trajectories choose 6= 1. consider systems light-like trajectories. convenience use notation p2 2, = c0 c , (3.1) 2 >, =, < 0 corresponds massive, massless, tachionic sectors system, respectively. reformulate system consideration minkowski space supply transition (2.4) appropriate transformations characteristic constants c0, c momenta pi preserve form initial action (1.2) initial hamiltonian system, namely, = 1 : = 2 : = 3 : = 4 : (e1, p1, k1, s, c0) (ie1,ip1, ik1,is, ic0); (e2, p2, k2, k1) (ie2,ip2, ik2, ik1), (e3, p3, k3, k2, c) (ie3,ip3, ik3, ik2,ic), (c, k3) (ic, ik3). (3.2) indeed, easy see ortonormality condition eaeb = (1)aaab changes (2.10) transformation. consequently, reduced system (2.30) appropriately changed parameters describes eective hamiltonian system corresponding action (1.2) minkowski space. 6 transition (3.2) induces following transformation parameters coordinates reduced system (2.30) (p, q, , c0, s) thus, reduced system reads (p, q, , c0, s) (p, iq, i, ic0,is) (ip,iq, i, c0, s) (p, q, i, c0, s) = 1 = 2 = 3 = 4. dp dq, as(cid:18) p2 2 + a2 2q2 ea(cid:19) 0, ea = (1)4a 2 2 (m 2/c2 0 + (1)1a), = (cid:26) 1, 1, = 1, 2 = 3, 4. expressions curvatures (2.29) read k2 k1 = (1)aq, k3 = (1)a q2 , k 2 2 k3 k 2 1 = (1)a. due positivity curvatures ki, conclude = 1, 3, = 2, 4, q < 0, 0 < q, < 0, > 0. (3.3) (3.4) (3.5) thus, cases system possesses solutions described conformal mechanics repulsive (a = 1, 2) attractive (a = 3, 4) potentials. classical solutions systems form q2 = (cid:26) eas2 + (1)2/ea, 2s, e 6= 0, e = 0, = 3, 4 potential attractive (a = 3, 4), parameter dened domain (cid:26) ] |/e|, ]|/e|, . rst consider systems repulsive potential dp dq, h0 = p2 2 + 2 2q2 , 2 = (cid:26) (1 2/c2 2e 0), (1 + 2/c2 0), < 0, = 0 > 0, = 1 (3.6) notice rst case trajectories time-like, space-like second case. since energy e positive classical quantum cases, get restrictions admissible value mass < 0 time-like trajectories (a = 1), 2 < c2 0, 2 < c2 0, > 0, = 2. 7 thus, rst case massive, massless, tachionic states, second case system tachionic. consider systems attractive potential. case trajectories space-like dened mechanics dp dq, h0 = p2 2 2 2q2 , 2 = (cid:26) (1 + 2/c2 2e 0) (1 + 2/c2 0) < 0, = 3 > 0, = 4 (3.7) spectrum conformal mechanics attractive potential continuous e > 0 e 0, 2 < 1/4 (see ). potential strongly attractive 2 > 1/4, e < 0, system dicrete spectrum innite number bound states given expression  en = h2b2 exp 2n p2 1/4 , n = 0,1,2, . . . , b undened phase factor. so, 2 n/c2 (cid:19)2 0 = 1 + (1)sgn(cid:18) bh exp 2n p2 1/4 , || > 1/2.
