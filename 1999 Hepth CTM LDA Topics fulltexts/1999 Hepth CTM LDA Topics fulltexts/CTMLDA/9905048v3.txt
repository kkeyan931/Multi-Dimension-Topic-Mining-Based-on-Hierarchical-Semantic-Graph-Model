abstract

the two-point green function of a local operator in cft corresponding to a massive symmetric tensor
eld on the ads background is computed in the framework of the ads/cf t correspondence. the obtained
two-point function is shown to coincide with the two-point function of the graviton in the limit when the
mass vanishes.

introduction

the ads/cf t correspondence conjectured in [1] states that in the large n limit and at large t hooft coupling
 = g2
y m n the classical supergravity/m-theory on the anti-de sitter space (ads) times a compact manifold is
dual to a certain su (n ) conformal gauge theory (cf t ) dened on the boundary of ads. one notable example
of this correspondence being the duality between d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory and d = 10
type iib supergravity theory on ads5  s5. the precise formulation of the conjecture was given in [2], [3]
where it was proposed to identify the generating functional for connected green functions of local operators in
cft with the on-shell value of the supergravity action under the restriction that the supergravity elds satisfy
the dirichlet conditions on the boundary of ads. recall that in the standard representation of ads as an
upper-half space x0 > 0, xk  r, k = 1, . . . d with the metric

ds2 = g dxdx =

1
x2

0 (cid:0)dx0dx0 + ij dxidxj(cid:1) ,

where ij could be either minkowksi or euclidean, the boundary includes the plane x0 = 0 as well as the point
x0 = . since the boundary is located innitely far away from any point in the interior the supergravity action
is infrared divergent and must be regularized. as was pointed out in [4] the consistent regularization procedure
(with respect to ward identities) requires one to shift the boundary of ads to the surface in the interior dened
by x0 = . then the dirichlet boundary value problem for supergravity elds is properly dened and one can
compute the on shell value of the supergravity action as a functional of the boundary elds. with the account
of this regularization procedure the standard formulation of the ads/cf t correspondence assumes the form:

where xi are some points on the boundary of adsd+1, oi(xi) are gauge invariant composite operators in cf t
and i(xi) are the corresponding supergravity elds. here we used the convention in which the coordinates x
of adsd+1 are split according to: x = (x0, x), so that x  rd. the action sonshell is the sum of the bulk
supergravity action and the boundary terms necessary to make the ads/cf t correspondence complete. the
origin of these boundary terms was elucidated in [5] where it was shown that they appear in passing from the
hamiltonian description of the bulk action to the lagrangian one.

the ads/cf t correspondence has been tested by computing various two- and three-point functions of
local operators in d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory on ads5. in particular two-point functions

corresponding to scalars [3] - [8], vectors [3], [4], [9], [10], spinors [10] - [12], the rarita-schwinger eld [13] - [16],
antisymmetric form elds [17] - [20] and the graviton [5], [21], [22] were computed on the ads background. the
only eld in the supergravity spectrum, found in [23], that has evaded the attention is the massive symmetric
traceless second-rank tensor eld dened by the action found in [24] for the case of ads5 and its natural
generalization for adsd+1.
in this paper we ll in the gap by computing the remaining two-point green
function.

we note that the dirichlet boundary value problem for the massive symmetric tensor eld is nontrivial due
to the fact that the equations of motion for various components are coupled. furthermore, in computing the
two-point green function we have to stick with the regularization procedure described above in order to obtain
the consistent result. at the end of our computation we nd that in the limit when the mass vanishes the
correlation function reduces to that of the massless symmetric tensor eld, i.e. the graviton.

2 equations of motion

the starting point in the calculation is the action for the symmetric traceless second-rank tensor  on adsd+1
which is a generalization of the action derived in [24]:

(2.1)

where g is the determinant of the ads metric g . let us note that this action already contains the appropriate
boundary terms and so can be readily used for computing the two-point green function. the action (2.1) leads
to the following equations of motion

 = 0,

(2.2)

where  is the levi-civita connection computed on the ads background. the massive term in (2.2) destroys
the standard symmetry:  =  +  , which is present in the case of the massless symmetric tensor
eld [5]. as a result of this symmetry breaking one can no longer perform gauge xing. since 
 is traceless,
we can eliminate the component 0
0 + i
i = 0. let us
introduce a concise notation:

0 from the equations of motion by using the constraint 0

then starting from (2.2) one can obtain the following system of coupled dierential equations

i, i = i

0,  = ii.

here eq.(2.3) corresponds to  =  = 0 in (2.2) while eq.(2.4) is found by taking  = 0,  = i and then
dierentiating with respect to xi. further, eq.(2.5) is obtained by applying the dierential operator ij to
eq.(2.2) with  = i,  = j. to simplify the notation, we chose the convention in which indices are raised and
lowered with the at metric  = x2
0 g so that, in particular,  =   . also for deniteness we assume
that the at metric  is euclidean. obviously the obtained results can be easily extended to the case when
 is minkowski. by introducing new variables

and imposing the condition that all elds vanish at the boundary x0   one can recast eqs.(2.3)-(2.5) into

(2.7)

where z is either k or i. from (2.6) it follows that  vanishes at x0   if and only if b(, k) = c(, k) = 0
so that   0 and therefore  = 0. taking into account the relation between ,  and  we nd that  = 0.
consequently,

taking the ratio of  and  at x0 =  results in the following relation

where (k) = (, k) and, similarly for other elds. in the limit   0, (k)  2(k) and therefore if we keep
(k) nite as   0, then (k) will tend to zero. on the other hand, keeping (k) nite leads to the divergence
of (k). consequently, we ought to x  at x0 = . thus we have:

let us note that (2.14) corresponds to (i0)-component of (2.2) while (2.15) is obtained by dierentiating (ij)-
component of (2.2) with respect to xi and then using (2.14) to express 0ii
j in terms of j. in both cases use
was made of eqs.(2.8)-(2.10). now we decompose i into the transversal and longitudinal parts:

by rewriting (2.14) for the transversal part of i and taking into account (2.4) one gets:

ki

k2 (k)#,

(2.29)

to compute the green function in the framework of the ads/cf t correspondence we need to evaluate the
on-shell value of the action. taking into account the equations of motion (2.2) and (2.23) one nds that the
on-shell value of (2.1) is

let us rst consider the contribution to sonshell that depends locally on boundary elds, i.e. does not contain
the normal derivative 0. we expect that such terms do not contribute to the non-local part of sonshell. so
we need to consider the behavior of  and k on the boundary of ads. to this end we note that according to
(2.11) the eld (k) is local since

(d  1)(k)k+1(k) + ((  1) + (k)2) k(k)

k(k)

=

while expanding solution (2.29) in  gives:

k2 (k)#,

(3.1)

here we did not include terms of order (k)2 and higher. in deriving (3.1) use was made of the power series
expansion of the modied bessel function [25]:

k(z) = 21()(cid:18)1 +

z2

4(1  )

+ . . .(cid:19) ,

(3.2)

where ellipsis indicate terms of order z4 and higher which evidently lead to local expressions as well as terms
of order z2+2 which will become negligible in the limit   0. from expression (3.1) it follows that i(k) is
a local eld. consequently, the terms in (3.1) that depend only on the value of elds at the boundary do not
contribute to the non-local part of sonshell as we have expected.

next we consider terms with the normal derivative 0. in evaluating such terms it is useful to employ the

following identity

d

dx0 (cid:18)(cid:16) x0

f (k) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=
 (cid:17) f (x0k)

clearly 0 is a local expression and therefore does not contribute to the non-local part of sonshell. conse-
quently, the non-local part is entirely determined by the following expression

(3.4)

taking into account solution (2.28), identity (3.3) and expansion (3.2) we see that the expression for 0i
j gets
three dierent contributions: the rst contribution comes from dierentiating the ratio x0
 raised to the power
 or (2 + ); the second contribution comes from o(k2) terms in the power expansion of the logarithmic
derivative of various functions in (2.28) and the third contribution comes from o(21k2) terms in the same
expansion. from (2.28) we can easily read o the rst contribution which is equal to

in the process of deriving (3.7) we dropped all terms containing i
  0. to understand why this is so, note that when i
(x) of i

j (x) which according to (2.11) is order o(2) at x0 = .

j is contracted with j

j since such terms are negligible in the limit
i (x) from (3.4) it gives the trace

now putting together (3.4) and (3.7) we arrive at the following formula for sonshell

in order to complete the calculation of the two-point green function we need to evaluate the integral over k in
(3.7). to this end, we employ the standard formula for the fourier transformation of generalized functions [26]:

with the help of (3.8) we nd that the non-local part of the on shell value of the action is equal to:
