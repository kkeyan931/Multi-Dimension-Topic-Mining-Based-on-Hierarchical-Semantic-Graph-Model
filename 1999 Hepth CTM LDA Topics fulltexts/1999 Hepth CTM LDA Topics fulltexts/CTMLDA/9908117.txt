(2) condition implies electric eld operators must behave like classical eld vari- ables. may also indicate electric eld operator eigenstates corresponding classical eld variables eigenvalues: h|e(xi) = h|e (xi). e+(xi)|i = e(xi)|i , (3) moreover, density operator must also expressed terms eigenstates |i. obviously, conventional fock space quantum theory obey condition. actually nontrivial problem, requires complete description classical motions terms quantum states. meantime, operator e(xi) hermitian operator. eigenstate problem nonhermitian op- erator unusual quantum mechanics. fortunately, quantum states already constructed schrodinger soon invention quantum me- chanics 1926. order answer question microscopic dynamics transits macroscopic world, schrodinger looked quantum states follow precisely corresponding classical trajectories time, meantime, states must also exact solution quantum dynamical equation (i.e., schrodinger equation). harmonic oscillator, states constructed : z(x) expn 1 2 (x + z)2o, (4) z complex variable. states actually gaussian wave packets centered classical trajectory z = (x+ip), x p position harmonic oscillator phase space satises classical equations motion. one show eq.

(54) however, since fermion creation annihilation operators satisfy anticom- mutation relationship, eigenvalue annihilation operator classical analogy cannot ordinary number. quantum-classical corresponding principle simply requires must anticommute: ij = ji , j = j , 2 = 0.

(86) (87) state |i standard expression spin coherent states. mentioned important property spin coherent state |i embedded topologically nontrivial geometrical space, i.e., two-dimensional sphere s2. varied directly (85). since si = i/2 pauli matrix, ds() expns+ = exp" = " cos|| || sin || || sin|| cos|| # = " x0 0 0 # x x0 # x (88) 19 x0 real x = x1 + ix2. also, ds() unitary operator leads 0 + |x|2 = x2 x2 0 + x2 1 + x2 2 = 1. (89) words, parameter space ds() two-sphere s2 = 2 ei. therefore, spin coherent states ono-to-one corresponding points s2 except north pole ambiguous since values correspond point. however, dening spin coherent states, ambiguous. example, one also dene spin coherent states |i = (cid:16) cos 2 ei + sin 2 s+(cid:17)| i, (90) also ono-to-one corresponding points s2 except south pole. two spin coherent states related simply phase factor, |i = ei|i.
