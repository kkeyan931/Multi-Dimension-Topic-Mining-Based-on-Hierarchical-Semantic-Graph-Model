abstract

instead of the innitesimal extrinsic and intrinsic perturbations
on strings, considered so far, we discuss the evolution and propaga-
tion of nite-amplitude perturbations. those intrinsic perturbations
may result in appearance of stable discontinuities similar to the shock
waves.

for representing the cosmic strings [1, 2] the simplest possibility is a
well-known goto-nambu model with the lagrangian density  = m2. the
energy density u and tension t have the microscopically constant values u =
t = m2. the extensions [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] are based on the introduction of the
current term  = hab,a,b - where ,a is a partial derivative (with respect
to 2-dimensional coordinates a on the world sheet) of a stream potential
function , on which the lagrangian  is dependent and hab = g x
,b is
the induced surface metric. the energy-momentum tensor of the string has
the form [8, 10]

,a x

and obeys the conservation law

t  = uuu  t vv

  t  = 0

where u and v are respectively the mutually orthogonal time-like and space-
like unit tangent vectors: uu = 1 = vv , uv = 0, and the funda-
mental tensor is

e  u[v]
these unit vectors correspond to the two conservation laws


  ee = vv  uu


 n = 0
for tangential currents j =  v and n =  u, where

is the particle number density. the latter two quantities are related with the
energy density and the tension by the formula

u = t + 

(7)

the perturbations introduced in the equations of motion (2), (4) may belong
to the two classes [9], namely the extrinsic perturbations of the world sheet
(wiggles) and the sound type longitudinal perturbations within the world
sheet (jiggles) propagating with the speed

respectively. the equation of state connecting the energy-density and ten-
sion allows to nd explicit results to express any quantity as a function of
argument t or u as well as of  or .

in the present paper we shall not restrict ourselves with the small ampli-
tude acoustic-type perturbations but rather try to seek the possibility of

2

discontinuities. the dierence from the acoustic regime discussed so far is
that conditions and parameters ahead and behind the front of discontinuity
are not the same.

we use a natural system of units, the plank and boltzmann constants

are h = kb = 1.

the appearance of discontinuities results from instability of the relevant
acoustic perturbations. at this step the analysis is similar to that in the
case of usual waves [16]. consider an innitesimal perturbation of an arbi-
trary prole u (x) = u0 + u (x) [or  (x) = 0 +  (x)], for instance a
sinusoidal wave, which travels with the sound speed cs. if

dcs
d 6= 0

(10)

i.e. the perturbation propagates with velocity cs () depending on the per-
turbation magnitude , the neighboring pieces of the initial prole will run
with dierent velocity:

cs (x) = cs|=0 +

cs


 (x)

(11)

in the case of the sinusoid each bottom tends to overtake the adjacent top.
for instance, if cs/ > 0, the pieces of the prole corresponding to the
largest density  will run with the highest speed; in turn, the higher the speed
the larger the density; thereby, the tops run faster than the bottoms and the
prole must change. after all, the initial smooth prole degenerates into an
ambiguous solution, since the bifurcation points take place; for example, a
sinusoidal wave becomes a saw-tooth. this behavior of the acoustic waves
may pertain both to the extrinsic (transversal) and intrinsic (longitudinal)
perturbations on strings, in other words, the jiggles or wiggles are those
embryos which nally can yield the catastrophes. the latter, in the case
of a longitudinal perturbation, implies no more than a discontinuity similar
to usual shock wave in continuous medium. from this process of the shock
wave formation, which accrue from the spontaneous acoustic wave growth,
we may easily predict the possible conguration of discontinuities: the sign
of derivative in (11) determines directly the sign of , or else, the sign of
 coincides with sigh of dcl/d. this may be written as

sign(dcl

d ) = sign{}

sign( dcl

d ) = sign{}

(12)

3

on the other hand, one may expect that the growth of an extrinsic per-
turbation leads to a collapse corresponding to the string self-intersection
[11] appearance; the detailed non-estimate analysis is beyond the scope of
the present paper where we direct our attention to the stationary solutions,
however, we have not missed the ability to point qualitatively this feasible
scenario. for a sinusoidal wave [12] with a given frequency  (or length )
and nite magnitude 0 (or u0) the catastrophe occurs in a time interval

 =


cs

=

2


cs

(dcs/d) 0

=

2


cs

(dcs/du) u0

(13)

which can be understood as a lifetime of perturbations. while the quantity
u0 is equal approximately to the eective temperature  [10, 7]. since
the characteristic frequency of the black-body radiation is proportional to
temperature:   , the time (13) is estimated as

1

cs

(dcs/du)

(14)

omitting dimensionless constant in the right side.

as for the longitudinal shock waves, constraint (10) allows only the possi-
bility of discontinuitis but does not provide their real existence. that is why,
the evolutionary condition is also necessary. nevertheless we can immediately
exclude the strings with the simplest lagrangians

 = m2

 = m2 + /2

(15)

from this category, since the relevant sound speed remains a constant. the
discontinuities are conceivable in the light of more realistic fourth and
fth models [14] (already applied to recent investigations [15]) which we
shall use bellow.

consider the longitudinal perturbations described by equations (4) and

the characteristic vector [9]

(37)

(38)

in both magnetic and electric regimes, i.e. without regard of the current
term  sign.

do real shock waves satisfy (37), (38)? from the above analysis of the
spontaneous acoustic wave growth, which leads to the shock wave forma-
tion, we may predict the possible conguration of discontinuities: the sign
of derivative in (11) determines directly the sign of n; or else the sign of
 coincides with the sign of dcl/d. hence, according to (33) and (34),
n < 0 in the magnetic regime, while  < 0 in the electric regime. the
latter possibility is forbidden by constraint (37). thereby, the shock waves
are permitted only in magnetic regime, i.e. in the case of time-like currents.
the evolutionary condition (27), (37), (38) itself [18, 16] is not sucient
for existence of longitudinal discontinuities, since the latter (although, in the
local sense, it can be compared with a wave in one dimension which is not
subject to that instability) may be unstable with respect to the extrinsic dis-
turbance of the world sheet. this is an analogue of the so-called goer-type
instability [16], conceivable as a rue on the wave surface. the instability
takes place if [9]

t
u

< 0

(39)

thus, if the energy density and tension is positive before the front, the shock
wave will be stable if

u+ > 0

t+ > 0

(40)

the latter constraint is automatically satised for the parameters in (31)-(
32) varying in the allowed range [14].

in future the present study may be extended to e.g. rotating string loops
or rings (known also as vortons) and, i can suspect, the recognition of
phenomenon similar to the elastic wave inertia in a rotating ring [22, 23].
