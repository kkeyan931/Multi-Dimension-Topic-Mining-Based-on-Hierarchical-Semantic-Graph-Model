abstract

we relate various black hole solutions in the near-horizon region to black hole so-
lutions in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories in order to argue that thermody-
namics of black holes in d  4 can be eectively described by thermodynamics of
black holes in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. we show that the bekenstein-
hawking entropies of single-charged dilatonic black holes and dilatonic p-branes in
arbitrary spacetime dimensions and with an arbitrary dilaton coupling parameter are
exactly reproduced by the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the two-dimensional black
hole in the associated two-dimensional dilaton gravity model. we comment that ther-
modynamics of non-extreme stringy four-dimensional black hole with four charges and
ve-dimensional black hole with three charges may be eectively described by ther-
modynamics of the black hole solutions with constant dilaton eld in two-dimensional
dilaton gravity theories.

1 introduction

the recent development in string duality and the observation [1] that d-branes can
carry charges of form potentials in the rr sector of string theories enabled us to address
fundamental issues in quantum gravity such as statistical interpretation of black hole
entropy within the framework of string theory. by applying the d-brane counting
technique, pioneered in ref. [2], it has been successful in reproducing the bekenstein-
hawking entropies of black hole solutions in string theories. generally, the d-brane
counting technique can be applied to the bps and the near-bps cases and few other
special cases such as non-bps extreme rotating black hole in four dimensions.

holographic principle [3, 4, 5] also has contributed to the microscopic interpreta-
tion of the bekenstein-hawking entropy. brown and henneaux [6] showed that the
asymptotic symmetry group of ads3 space is the conformal group in two dimensional
spacetime at the boundary. by using this idea, carlip [7, 8] and strominger [9] were
able to exactly reproduce the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the three-dimensional
constant curvature black hole of banados, teitelboim and zanelli (btz) [10] by count-
ing microscopic degrees of freedom of the conformal eld theory at the boundary. an
important observation [11] by hyun that (uplifted) black hole solutions in string theory
can be put in the form of the product of the btz black hole and a sphere through a
series of u-duality transformations enabled the microscopic counting of non-extreme
stringy black holes in four and ve dimensions by applying the result of carlip and
strominger (for example, ref. [12]).

as pointed out in ref. [11], higher-dimensional black hole solutions in string theories
can also be related to two-dimensional black hole solutions through u-duality transfor-
mations. the four- and the ve-dimensional non-extreme black holes in string theory
are related [17, 18, 19, 20] to two-dimensional black holes in the jackiw-teitelboim
(jt) model [21, 22] and the callan-giddings-harvey-strominger (cghs) model [23]
and to the two-dimensional charged black hole of mcguigan, nappi and yost [24].
recently, progress has been made [14, 15, 16] in reproducing the bekenstein-hawking
entropies of the two-dimensional black holes by using the cardys formula [13] for
the boundary conformal theory. furthermore, it is argued in refs.
[25, 26] that the
bekenstein-hawking entropy of the generic black holes in arbitrary dimensional pure
gravity theories can be reproduced by the microscopic calculation based on the confor-
mal theory associated with the two-dimensional subset of the spacetime. so, it seems
that black holes in two-dimensional gravity theories, which were originally studied
as unrealistic toy models for quantum theory of gravity, have closer connection with
realistic black holes in d  4 than it was originally thought.

it is the purpose of this paper to relate various black hole solutions in d  4
to black hole solutions in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. in section 2, we

1

relate a single-charged dilatonic black hole solution in d  4 with an arbitrary dilaton
coupling parameter to a black hole solution in a two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory.
we nd that the bekenstein-hawking entropies of these two black holes are the same
in the large charge limit or the near-extremal limit. in section 3, we argue that the
thermodynamics of a dilatonic p-brane in arbitrary spacetime dimensions and with an
arbitrary dilaton couple parameter can also be described by a black hole solution in a
two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory. in section 4, we comment that thermodynamics
of the non-extreme four-dimensional stringy black hole with four charges and the non-
extreme ve-dimensional stringy black hole with three charges may be more naturally
described by the black holes with constant dilaton eld in two-dimensional dilaton
gravity theories.

2 single-charged dilatonic black holes

in this section, we consider single-charged dilatonic black hole solutions with an ar-
bitrary dilaton coupling parameter a and in arbitrary spacetime dimensions d. the
result in this section can be applied not only to all the single-charged dilatonic black
holes but also to multi-charged black holes in string theories, because in the near-
horizon limit the actions for the multi-charged black hole solutions in string theories
can be reduced (with the guidance of the explicit solutions in the near-horizon limit)
to the actions for the two-dimensional dilaton gravity with possibly dierent forms
of the dilaton potential term from the one obtained in this section. the exceptional
case is the multi-charged stringy black hole solutions with regular bps limit, i.e., the
four-dimensional black hole with four charges and the ve-dimensional black hole with
three charges. in this special case, all the scalars of the solution become constant in the
near-horizon limit and therefore one cannot relate such black hole solutions to black
hole solutions with non-trivial dilaton eld in two-dimensional dilaton gravity models
2. this exceptional case will be separately discussed in the last section.

the corresponding einstein-frame action is

2on the other hand, the near-horizon region solutions for this case can be related to the btz black
hole solution when the solutions are uplifted to one higher spacetime dimensions, after the u -duality
transformations when necessary. (note, however, that in such embeddings of black hole solutions the
harmonic function for the charge associated with the gravitational wave is allowed to not take the
near-horizon form and therefore some of scalars are not constant.) the action for the btz black
hole solution can be reduced to a two-dimensional dilaton gravity model action upon dimensional
reduction. but in this paper, we shall ignore the higher-dimensional origin of black hole solution, just
considering the einstein-frame metric itself. see the second paragraph of the last section for more
comments.

we now show that the bekenstein-hawking entropy (22) of the two-dimensional
black hole compactied from the dilatonic black hole in d  4 is the same as the
3the most general solution in two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory with general dilaton potential

is previously constructed in ref. [32].

bekenstein-hawking entropy (4) of the original dilatonic black hole in d  4. one
can bring the two-dimensional part g = gd
 (,  = t, r) of the near-horizon metric
(10) to the form (17) of the solution of the 2-dimensional dilaton gravity theory with
the action (15) by applying the weyl rescaling g =

the resulting metric g has the form (17) with the mass m given by

(23)

(24)

by plugging the expression (24) for the mass m into the expression (22) for the entropy
of the two-dimensional solution (17), making use of the following relation:

(26)

note, the einstein gravitational constant d is related to the newton constant gd
as 2
d = 8gd in the unit c = 1. so, in the limit of large  (i.e. the large charge
limit or the near-extremal limit), in which sinh   cosh , the bekenstein-hawking
entropy (26) of the two-dimensional solution (17) with (24) becomes exactly same as
the bekenstein-hawking entropy (4) of the d-dimensional dilatonic black hole (2).
therefore, thermodynamics of the d-dimensional dilatonic black hole solution (2) can
be eectively described by thermodynamics of the 2-dimensional black hole solution
(17).

3 dilatonic p-branes

when all the longitudinal directions are compactied on a compact manifold, a p-brane
in d spacetime dimensions reduces to a dilatonic black hole in d p spacetime dimen-
sions. so, by using the result of the previous section, one can see that thermodynamics
of dilatonic p-branes can also be eectively described by black holes in two-dimensional
dilaton gravity models. also, thermodynamics of the delocalized intersecting brane so-
lutions can be described by thermodynamics of black holes in two-dimensional dilaton

6

gravity theories, since all the delocalized intersecting brane solutions reduce to multi-
charged black holes after all the longitudinal and the relative transverse directions are
compactied. in the following, we relate a dilatonic p-brane in d spacetime dimensions
to a dilatonic black hole in d  p spacetime dimensions.

the einstein-frame action for the d-dimensional dilatonic p-brane with an arbitrary

dilaton coupling parameter b is given by

where fp+2 is the eld strength of the (p + 1)-form potential a(p+1) = am1...mp+1dxm1

(30)

since the p-brane solution (28) does not depend on the longitudinal coordinates
xi (i = 1, ..., p), i.e., has the isometry along these directions, one can compactify the
solution along the longitudinal directions on t p to obtain a black hole solution in dp
spacetime dimensions. such dimensional reduction of the dilatonic p-brane solution
(28) leads to the dilatonic black hole solution of the form (2) in d  p spacetime
dimensions (i.e., d in the solution (2) is replaced by d  p) with the dilaton coupling

(32)

where  is given by eq. (3) with d replaced by d  p and a given by eq. (31). by
using the fact that the value of p does not change under the dimensional reduction
(so, p in eq. (30) and  in eq. (32) are the same) and the following relation between
the d-dimensional newton constant gd and the (d p)-dimensional newton constant
gdp:

gdp =

4p(dp3)

(d2)p p

(33)

where vt p is the volume of t p, on which the dilatonic p-brane is compactied, one can
see that the entropy (32) of the dimensionally reduced black hole in (dp)-dimensions
is the same as the entropy (30) of the dilatonic p-brane (28) in d-dimensions. in the
previous section, we have shown that the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the dilatonic
black hole is the same as the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the corresponding two-
dimensional solution in the limit of large charge or the near-extremal limit. so, the
bekenstein-hawking entropy (30) of the dilatonic p-brane (28) in d dimensions has
to be the same as the bekenstein-hawking entropy of a black hole solution (17) of
the associated two-dimensional dilaton gravity theory in the large charge limit or the
near-extremal limit.

4 non-extreme black holes with regular bps limit

in this section, we consider black holes in string theories with regular bps limits. such
black holes are four-dimensional black hole with four charges and ve-dimensional black
hole with three charges. the previous related works (e.g. refs.
[17, 18, 19]) relate
such black holes to two-dimensional charged black hole solution of mcguigan, nappi
and yost [24], which has non-trivial dilaton eld as well as u(1) gauge eld. in such
works, black hole solutions which contain a charge associated with the gravitational
wave are considered or u-duality transformations are applied to obtain solutions with
the gravitational wave charge. then, one takes the limit in which only the harmonic
functions associated with other charges take the near-horizon limit form, while the
harmonic function associated with the gravitational wave (and the harmonic function
of the fundamental string with the charge assumed to be equal to the gravitational
wave charge) does not take the near-horizon form.
in this limit, the string-frame
spacetime metric is put into the form of the direct product of the mcguigan, nappi

8

and yost black hole and a sphere after the coordinate transformation. then, the
bekenstein-hawking entropy of the two-dimensional black hole becomes exactly same
as the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the d = 4, 5 black holes.

when one counts the microscopic degrees of freedom associated with the black hole
entropy by making use of two-dimensional model or three-dimensional model of the
btz black hole [10], one considers conformal theory at the spacetime boundary, which
is associated with the gravity theory only and therefore does not have anything to do
with string theories (although it is shown [34] that the btz black hole solution can be
embedded as a solution of string theory). we also note that the form of the einstein-
frame spacetime metric, which gives rise to the bekenstein-hawking entropy formula,
is insensitive to dierent ways of embedding black holes as the higher-dimensional in-
tersecting branes in string theories or m-theory. so, it seems to be unnatural to uplift
the black hole solutions to ten dimensions and apply series of u-duality transforma-
tions to make the black hole solutions carry the charge associated specically with
the gravitational wave of string theory for the purpose of relating the near-horizon
limit spacetime metric to the btz black hole solution (in spacetime in one higher di-
mensions) or to the two-dimensional charged black hole solution of mcguigan, nappi
and yost. also, it seems to be unnatural to let only part of harmonic functions take
near-horizon limit forms (by applying the series of u-duality transformations and the
so-called shift transformation), while that associated with the gravitational wave (and
fundamental string) not taking near-horizon limit form, in order to relate the d = 4, 5
black hole solutions to the btz black hole solution (and to the two-dimensional charge
black hole of mcguigan, nappi and yost), when we take notice of the fact that all the
harmonic functions of the black hole solutions in the einstein-frame are actually on the
equal putting (i.e., the einstein-frame metric is symmetric under the permutations of
harmonic functions). such unnaturalness becomes pronounced for the particular case
of the reissner-nordstrom black holes, i.e, the case of equal constituent charges. first,
when all the charges are equal, all the scalars of the solutions are constant, but equal
charge limit of the above mentioned near-horizon limit solutions does not lead to con-
stant scalar elds since some of harmonic functions have near-horizon form and some
do not. second, it is unnatural to let some of harmonic functions not take near-horizon
forms, when all the charges have the same magnitude.

so, in this section, we consider only the generic einstein-frame spacetime metric for
black hole solutions, disregarding higher-dimensional origin of constituent charges and
taking all the harmonic functions on the equal putting. we will therefore not uplift the
d = 4, 5 black holes to higher dimensions and we will let all the harmonic functions
associated with the constituent charges take the near-horizon limit forms. perhaps,
our description of non-extreme black hole with regular bps limit in this section may
not lead to the correct description of black hole thermodynamics. but it seems to be

9

more natural from the perspective of the einstein-frame form of the spacetime metric
of black hole solutions. the generic property of stringy black holes with regular bps
limit is that in the near-horizon limit all the scalar elds (including dilaton) of the
black hole solutions become constant and the spacetime metric takes the ads2  sn
form. therefore, it seems that the solution of the associated two-dimensional model
should have constant dilaton eld.

the most general action for the two-dimensional dilaton gravity, which depends at
most on two derivatives of the elds, can be transformed to the following form [35, 36]:

s =

1
22

2 z d2xg [rg + v ()] .

(34)

the eld equations of this action has a solution with constant dilaton  = 0, provided
that the potential v () satises the following conditions [37]:

dv ()

6= 0.

v (0) = 0,

d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)0
gdxdx = e2(cid:16)dt2 + dx2(cid:17) ,

then, in the conformal gauge with the following spacetime metric:

d2
dx2 +

dx2  e2v = 0,

(35)

(36)

(37)

i.e.  = 0 and rg =
lead to the solution with constant spacetime curvature,
2e2 d2
dx2 = v (0). this is in accordance with the fact that the near-horizon re-
gion spacetimes of the four-dimensional black hole with four charges and the ve-
dimensional black hole with three charges contain the ads2 space. the following
spacetime metric solution [37] to the eld equations (37) in the schwarzschild gauge is
obtained by redening the spatial coordinate through the relation dy = e2dx:

ds2

2 = (cid:18)r0

2

y2  k(cid:19) dt2 +(cid:18)r0

2

y2  k(cid:19)

1

dy2,

(38)

where r0 = v (0) is the ricci scalar of the metric and k is an integration constant.
in the following subsections, we bring the near-horizon region metrics of the d = 4, 5
black holes to the form of the solution (38). then, the study of thermodynamics of

can have any higher-dimensional origin. namely, the metric (39) can be the metric
of a heterotic black hole solution [38, 39, 40] with the kaluza-klein u(1) electric and
magnetic charges and the ns-ns 2-form u(1) electric and magnetic charges or the
metric of a type-iib black hole solution compactied from intersecting d3-branes.
regardless of various higher-dimensional origins as intersecting branes, the einstein-
frame metric for all the four-dimensional stringy black hole with four charges have the
form (39).
