abstract

eigenvalue repulsion can explain the holographic growth of black
holes in matrix theory. the resulting picture is essentially the same as
the boltzman gas picture but avoids any assumption about the eec-
tive potential between the d0 branes. further, eigenvalue repulsion
extends the boltzman gas picture past the bfks point to n  s.
the use of boltzman statistics is natural in this picture.

1 introduction

since matrix theory is conjectured to be the discrete light-cone quantization
of m-theory, it is natural to use it as a way of investigating the quantum
properties of black holes.

banks, fischler, klebanov and susskind (bfks) and martinec and li,
have studied black holes whose entropy, s, roughly the same as their light-
like momentum, n [1, 2, 3]. they can be formed by reducing the energy of a
highly excited cluster of d0 branes until the momentum of the individual d0
branes is the inverse of the clusters transverse size (saturating the heisenberg
uncertainty bound). the transverse size is found by setting the potential
equal to the kinetic energy (in accord with the virial theorem). the choice
of potential is crucial. the obvious choice, v4/r7, gives the schwarzschild
radius, rs. however, at this point the expansion parameter for the potential
is 1, so the expansion is on the verge of breaking down [4].

nonetheless, once the correct radius is found, matrix theory makes many
correct predictions about black holes: the right mass for a given radius [2,
4, 3] and the correct long range gravitational potential between equal mass
black holes [3]. the constituents have the correct properties to be hawking
radiation [3]. if the particles are treated with boltzman statistics, the entropy
is even correct [5, 4, 3].

the problem becomes more pronounced when n  s. simply replacing
the d0 branes with bound states and using the v4/r7 potential fails to give
correct results. li identied other terms in the matix theory eective poten-
tial that could give the correct radius, but it is not clear why those terms
would dominate [6]. li and martinec get the correct results using v4/r7 to
approximate processes that exchange longitudinal momentum [7].

eigenvalue repulsion can be used to nd the size of black holes without
any knowledge of the potential. using this size, all of the previous black hole
results follow [4, 7, 8]. eigenvalue repulsion allows the results to be extended
to n  s. because eigenvalue repulsion involves the o-diagonal elements of
the matrices, it will be natural to treat the system with boltzman statistics.
first, i describe eigenvalue repulsion in matrix theory. then i nd the
radius and energy at r = rs and discuss entropy in this case. finally, i
discuss r  rs. all factors of order one are ignored throughout.

2 low energies and eigenvalue repulsion

to study black holes we need to understand matrix theory in the region where
the energy per d0 brane is very low (much less than the plank energy). this
will mean two things: first, remote d0 branes are not connected by strings
(i.e. the o-diagonal elements between well separated d0 branes are in the
ground state).

as the d0 branes get within lp of each other, the quantum uctuations
in the o diagonal elements connecting the d0 branes also become of order
lp, so the d0 branes are able to explore their full matrix degrees of freedom.
this region is sometimes called the stadium. the second consequence of
the low energy is that the wave-function must be almost constant across the
width of the stadium since variations on this scale would require very large
kinetic energies.

the atness of the wave function in the stadium means that we can look
to the theory of random matrices for intuition about how the system will
explore the full matrix degrees of freedom. it is known that the statistics
of random matrices strongly favors matrices with well separated eigenvalues,
pushing the d0 branes to the edge of the stadium.

the role of eigenvalue repulsion can be made a bit more quantitative. in
the stadium, the distance between two d0 branes is r2 =  tr x ix i. for
xed r, this is the equation for a sphere in 27 dimensions (nine directions
times the three independent generators of traceless, antihermitian, 2  2 ma-
trices). since the wave function is relatively at in this region, the probability
that the d0 branes are a distance r apart falls o like r26. that is 18 powers
of r faster than the r8 probability that one would expect for the nine spatial
directions. this means that the wave function is strongly dominated by con-
gurations which have the d0 branes near the edge of the stadium. there is
no actual potential pushing the d0-branes apart, but this statistical eect is
the matrix theory manifestation of eigenvalue repulsion.1

the situation is similar when n d0 branes are present. when the sep-
aration between any two d0 branes falls below lp, new matrix degrees of
freedom open up and eigenvalue repulsion turns on. this causes the wave
function to strongly favor congurations with size at least n 1/9lp, one d0
brane per plank volume.

1 the gauge symmetry does not aect this result. the gauge eld degrees of freedom
are removed by going to a = 0 gauge. the assumption that the wave function is at
satises the requirement that the state be annihilated by the gauge generators.

2

it has been shown that composite systems of d0 branes grow like n 1/3,
much faster than the n 1/9 growth predicted by eigenvalue repulsion [9].
however, this rapid growth is caused by uctuations in very high energy,
o-diagonal elements of the matrix connecting widely separated d0 branes.
only very high energy probes will be able to see these high frequency quan-
tum uctuations. eigenvalue repulsion is a zero energy eect, so it should
be seen by any probe. similarly, a low energy probe will be captured by a
black hole if its impact parameter is less than rs, but a high energy probe
(with energy much greater than the mass of the black hole) will be captured
at a much greater distance.

3 black holes at the bfks point

a very highly excited clump of d0 branes has enough mass to create a black
hole whose radius is larger than the light-like compactication radius. low-
ering the systems energy will slow the constituent d0 branes until the mo-
mentum saturates the heisenberg uncertainty bound, i.e. the momentum of
individual d0 branes is one over the size of the clump. this is the bfks
point [1]. using the size, n 1/9lp, given by eigenvalue repulsion one can nd
the mean kinetic energy.

we know from the virial theorem that the potential energy will be of the
same order as the kinetic energy, so we do not need to know anything about
its form.

other than the form of the potential, this is exactly the system stud-
ied by previous authors. as they have observed, this system has the right
relationship between mass and radius [2, 4, 3],

and gives the correct long range gravitational interaction for equal mass black
holes [3]. the constituent d0 branes have the right energy and momentum
to be hawking radiation, should they escape [3].

4 entropy

to get the correct entropy the d0 branes must be treated with boltzman
statistics [3]. this occurs because the wave function is dominated by states
that break all of the gauge symmetry mixing remote d0 branes, even the
permutation symmetry.

the large separation between the majority of d0 branes breaks the con-
tinuous symmetry down to the permutation symmetry. if all the d0 branes
were far apart one could gauge transform all of the matrices into diagonal
form simultaneously. since this diagonalization would only be unique up to
permutations, the permutation symmetries would be unbroken.

however, since neighboring d0 branes are near enough to explore the full
matrix degrees of freedom, the o diagonal elements connecting them cannot
be integrated out [7]. the matrices cannot be simultaneously diagonalized,
only put in band diagonal form.2 this breaks the permutation symmetry
because a gauge transformation that permutes remote d0 branes would take
the matrices out of band diagonal form.

for example, consider a situation where d0 branes a, b and c are close
together and e, f and g are close together, but the two sets are far apart.
this will be represented by matrices like this (all the 1s represent terms of

2 here i am using band diagonal in a very general sense. the d0 branes will be
connected to their nearest neighbors in all nine dimensions. there will be no way to write
these matrices as two dimensional arrays with zeros away from the diagonal.

the symmetries mixing neighboring d0 branes is not broken at all. how-
ever, the number of near neighbors is of order one, so in doing statistical
machanics for large n the d0 branes should be treated as distinguishable.

this description is similar to the proposal of bfks in which the d0
branes are tethered to a background conguration [3]. here, however, there
is no rm distinction between the background and the excitations.

5

5 beyond the bfks point

at the bfks point the constituent d0 branes have already saturated their
uncertainty bound, so the energy of the system cannot be lowered by further
reducing their momentum. they will have to band together into bound
states. these bound states will have a larger mass (in the matrix theory,
they are of course massless in m-theory) and will be able to live in a smaller
volume with less energy [4].

the arguments of the previous section would appear to apply to the bound
states of matrix theory, causing them to be seen by low energy probes as large
objects. however, even in the large n limit, these objects should not have
hard interactions for impact parameters greater than lp. some miracle of the
bound state wave function and supersymmetry must cause cancellations that
allow the objects to pass through each other without interaction.

these miracles will not occur when the wave functions are excited. in
eleven dimensions this corresponds to changing the supergravitons into black
holes. excitations will cause the graviton to break into a metastable collec-
tion of n smaller gravitons. each of these is unexcited, and is therefore still
able to pass through the others without interaction. the distance at which
the eigenvalue repulsion plays a role is still lp.

consider a system of two well separated bound states, consisting of m1
and m1 d0 branes each. they will break the u(m1 + m2) symmetry down
to u(m1)  u(m2). there are m1m2 strings connecting them, each with
8 transverse, complex polarizations. the remaining u(m1)  u(m2) gauge
symmetry and the o(8) rotation symmetry about the axis of separation is
enough to relate all of these o diagonal modes, so they must all have the
same mass. the mass is given by the separation of the bound states exactly
as in the case of two separated d0 branes. when the centers of the two bound
states get within a distance lp of each other, all 16m1m2 of these degrees of
freedom open up, causing tremendous eigenvalue repulsion.

this bound state cluster picture closely mimics the description at the
bfks point, and has been studied by several previous authors (once the
radius is found). once the radius is found, many of the successes of n = s
can be carried over in a straightforward manner to n  s. in particular,
the mass to radius relationship is correct, the constituent bound states have
the right properties to become hawking radiation, and boltzman statistics
give the correct entropy [7].

the breaking of the statistics symmetries by o diagonal uctuations

should work for bound states exactly as it did for individual d0 branes,
explaining the use of boltzman statistics.

5.1 newtonian potential

as a demonstration, consider the potential between two static black holes of
dierent masses.3 we will assume that their separation is greater than r,
where v4/r7 dominates the two body interactions.

it will be much more convenient to use the velocities of the bound states
rather than their momenta. the mass of a bound state is hm/r. since the
bound states that make up a black hole have momenta h/rs the velocities
are r/rsm.

first, observe that the velocity of the constituent bound states is the

boost parameter required to bring the black hole to the rest frame.

black holes that are at rest relative to each other will be made of bound
states with the same velocity, though not of the same momentum.

it will be useful to note:

next, we nd the energy shift due to the v4/r7 interaction. since the
velocities of the constituents are roughly the same in the two black holes,

from gao and zhangs treatment [8].

6 conclusions

eigenvalue repulsion predicts the size of black holes without requiring knowl-
edge of the eective potential between the constituent d0 branes, and sug-
gests a mechanism for breaking the statistics symmetry of the constituents.
however, this understanding is still rather primitive. much work will have
to be done even to turn the sketch presented here into a derivation of black
hole thermodynamics.

little has been said about the fermion degrees of freedom in this theory.
might supersymmetry cause terms that cancel the eigenvalue repulsion? this
does not appear to happen. supersymmetry requires that fermionic ground
state energy cancels bosonic ground state energy. however, eigenvalue repul-
sion is purely statistical and is not aected by the fermionic states.

i would like to thank je harvey, emil martinec and miao li for helpful

conversations about these matters.
