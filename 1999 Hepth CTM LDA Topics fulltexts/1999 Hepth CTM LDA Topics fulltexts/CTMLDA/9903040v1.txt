abstract

we investigate zero modes of the dirac operator coupled to an abelian gauge eld in
three dimensions. we nd that the existence of a certain class of zero modes is related
to a specic topological property precisely when the requirement of nite chernsimons
action is imposed. in addition we nd that we also have a solution to the three dimensional
seibergwitten equations. this requires automatically the inclusion of a chernsimons
term in the action and consequent connections with a topological mass for the gauge
eld.

1 introduction

zero modes for fermions for the dirac operator /da = /  i/a are of importance in many
places in quantum eld theory. they are the ingredients for the computation of the index
of the dirac operator and play a key role in understanding anomalies. in abelian gauge
theories, which is what we are concerned with here, they aect crucially the behaviour of
the fermion determinant det(/da) in quantum electrodynamics. the nature of the qed
functional integral depends strongly on the degeneracy of the bound zero modes. in three
dimensions little is known about such fermion bound states, the rst examples being
only obtained in 1986 in the paper of [1]. in our paper we want to further investigate
this problem of zero modes of the abelian dirac operator in three dimensional euclidean
space (i.e., the pauli operator).

it should be emphasized here that the problem of zero modes of the pauli operator, in
addition to being interesting in its own right, has some deep physical implications. the
authors of [1] were mainly interested in these zero modes because in an accompanying
paper [2] it was proven that one-electron atoms with suciently high nuclear charge in
an external magnetic eld are unstable if such zero modes of the pauli operator exist.

further, there is an intimate connection between the existence and number of zero
modes of the pauli operator for strong magnetic elds on the one hand, and the nonpertur-
bative behaviour of the three dimensional fermionic determinant (for massive fermions)
in strong external magnetic elds on the other hand. the behaviour of this determinant,
in turn, is related to the paramagnetism of charged fermions, see [3, 4]. so, a thorough
understanding of the zero modes of the pauli operator is of utmost importance for the
understanding of some deep physical problems, as well.

in addition, it is speculated in [4] that the existence and degeneracy of zero modes
for qed3 may have a topological origin as it does in qed2cf. [4] for details and an
account of the situation for qed2,3,4. the results of the present paper tend to support
such a point of view.

our paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we review the simple example of a zero mode that was given in [1], and
we provide some more examples of zero modes of a similar type. in section 3, we show,
for a whole class of zero modes, that their existence is related to a specic, associated
topological number being an odd integer. this result will follow from the conditions of
square integrability of the zero mode and niteness of the chernsimons action. if only
the weaker condition of square integrable zero modes and magnetic elds is imposed,
we nd a broader class of possible zero modes. in section 4, a generalization to higher
angular momentum is discussed.

in sections 5 and 6 we discuss a relation to seibergwitten equations. we shall
describe in section 5 the seibergwitten equations in three and four dimensions and,
in section 6, show that a specic zero mode in this paper gives rise to a solution of the
three dimensional seibergwitten equations. this leads to the natural inclusion of the
chernsimons action term in their action. such a term has been considered in the past
(cf. [5, 6]) as a mechanism for the topological generation of mass in three dimensional

1

gauge theories hence its natural appearance here is of some interest.

2 some examples

first we want to briey review a specic solution that was given in [1]. let  be a
two-component, square integrable spinor on r3 and ai a gauge eld leading to a square
integrable eld strength fij = aj,i  ai,j (further x = (x1, x2, x3), r = |x|, and i are the
pauli matrices). the authors of [1] observed that a solution of the dirac equation

 i/(x)  iii(x) = ai(x)i(x)
could be easily obtained from a solution of the simpler equation

 i/ = h

(1)

(2)

for some scalar function h(x). in this case the corresponding gauge eld that obeys the
dirac equation (1) together with the spinor (2) is given by

ai = h

i


.

in addition, they gave the following explicit example

 = (1 + r2) 3

2 (1 + i~x~)0

where 0 is the constant unit spinor 0 = (1, 0)t. the spinor (4) obeys

 i/ =

3

1 + r2 

and is, therefore, a zero mode for the gauge eld

~a =

3

1 + r2

~


=

3

(1 + r2)2

1  x2

2 + x2

 .

(6)

(the geometrical behaviour of the gauge eld (6) is shown in figs. 1, 2. the integral
curves of this gauge eld are closed circles that lie on tori, and they wrap once around
each direction of the torus (fig. 1a). any two dierent curves are linked exactly once (see
fig. 1b for two curves on dierent tori).)

next we want to give some more examples of solutions of the type (2), (3), that may
be obtained by simple generalizations of the solution (4), (6). from these examples we
will nd that a zero mode exists when a certain topological number is an odd integer,
and we will show in the next section that this feature holds true for a whole class of zero
modes.

some rst examples of solutions may be constructed from the following ansatz

where

(l) = (1 + r2)( 3

2 +l)[(1 +

anr2n)1 +

lxn=1
x  ixjj.

bnr2nx]0

lxn=0

(7)

(8)

the sums are restricted by square integrability of (l), and the choice a0 = 1 just xes
an arbitrary normalization. with the help of the relations

x2 = r21 ,

xjjx = x ,

ijjx = 3  1

one easily nds, e.g., for l = 1

 i/(1) = i/(1 + r2) 5

=

3b0

(1 + r2)

(11)

r2)x]0

and the proportionality condition (2) can be met by comparing coecients of powers of
r2. the resulting system of equations is linear in all coecients except b0, for which it is
of fourth order. actually, it is of second order in b2
0, because the sign ip bi  bi just
corresponds to a parity transformation xi  xi. one of the two solutions for b2
0 just
reproduces the simplest solution l = 0, (4), by producing a common factor 1 + r2 in the
numerator of (10), the other solution is new,

(1) = (1 + r2) 5

2 [(1

5
3  r2)x]0

 i/(1) =

5

1 + r2 (1).

(12)

(13)

this pattern repeats itself for higher l. the condition (2) always leads to a system of
equations for the ai, bi with l + 1 dierent solutions (up to parity). l of these solutions
just reproduce the lower (k), k < l, whereas one solution produces a new zero mode,
(l). explicitly, the coecients ai, bi for (l) read
ai = (1)lb|il|

(cid:16) iyj=0

(2j + 3)(cid:17)(i!)bi = (1)i(cid:16) i1yk=0

(l  k)(cid:17)(cid:16) iyh=0
n=1 anr2n, b =pl

and, with the abbreviations a =pl

eld reads

(2l + 3  2h)(cid:17)

n=0 bnr2n the corresponding gauge

(for the behaviour of ~a(1) see fig. 3). all these zero modes behave like   r4 for
r  , as well as the corresponding gauge elds, ~a2  h2  r4.
some more examples of zero modes of the type (2) may be found by the following
observation. the simplest zero mode (4) may be expressed like

 = g(r)u0 ,

g(r) =

1

1 + r2 , u =

1

(1 + r2)

1
2

(1 + x)

(16)

where g is a scalar function (depending only on r) and u is an su(2) matrix. so one
may wonder whether there are zero modes for higher powers of u,

(n) = gu n0

where g is a scalar that has to be determined. e.g., for n = 2 one nds

(2) = gu 20 = g(1 + r2)1[(1  r2)1 + 2x]0

and, with a little bit of algebra (  /r2)

i/g(r2)(1 + r2)1[(1  r2)1 + 2x]0 =

2

(1 + r2)2 [(2r2(1 + r2)g + (3 + r2)g)1 + (2g  (1 + r2)(1  r2)g)x]0

!= hg(1 + r2)1[(1  r2)1 + 2x]0.

(17)

(18)

(19)

comparison of the coecients of 1 and x leads to two rst order linear dierential
equations for the function g, which have to be proportional. this determines h and, in
turn, g (we abbreviate u  r2)

1)

g =

(1  u)(1 + u)h  2(3 + u)

4u(1 + u)

g

2)

g =

2  (1 + u)h
(1  u)(1 + u)

g

 h =

2(3  u)
(1 + u)2

g = 4

(1 + u)2 g ,

g = exp(

4

1 + u

)

and we nd

(2) =

4

1+r2

e
1 + r2 [(1  r2)1 + 2x]0

 i/(2) =

2(3  r2)
(1 + r2)2 (2).

(20)

(21)

this formal solution (2) is not square integrable and, therefore, is not an acceptable zero
mode. however, the same ansatz for the third power of u,

(3) = gu 30 =

g

(1 + r2)

[(1  3r2)1 + (3  r2)x]0

3
2

leads to a square integrable zero mode,

(3) =

(1+r2)2  8

e

(1 + r2)

 i/(3) =

(1 + r2)3 (3).

(22)

(23)

(24)

zero modes for higher powers of u may be computed in an analogous fashion, and the
above pattern repeats itself. for odd powers of u one nds square integrable zero modes,
whereas for even powers the formal solutions are not square integrable. this may lead to
the conjecture that even and odd powers of u dier in their geometrical or topological
properties, and these properties are related to the existence of zero modes. so, let us
briey discuss the geometry of the matrices u n. the rst power

u = (1 + r2) 1

2 (1 + ir~n~)

nj =

xj
r

,

~n2 = 1

has the following properties

u(r = 0) = 1 , u(r = ) = i~n~,

(25)

(26)

(27)

i.e., it behaves similarly to an su(2) monopole and tends to the hedgehog shape i~n~ for
r   (actually this hedgehog corresponds to the identity map s2(r = )  s2(unit
vector ~n) with winding number 1). the matrix u 2

u 2 = (1 + r2)1[(1  r2)1 + 2ir~n~]

has the properties

u 2(r = 0) = 1 , u 2(r = 1) = i~n~ , u 2(r = ) = 1

(28)

(29)

i.e., it is dened on r3 compactied to s3 (actually, it corresponds to a map s3  s3
with winding number 1), and, therefore, it is similar to a skyrmion. in addition, it is
equal to the hedgehog at the sphere of radius 1.

for higher powers of u this pattern repeats itself. odd powers of u tend to the
hedgehog for r  , i.e., they are of the monopole type. even powers tend to 1, i.e.,
they are of the skyrmion type.

5

3 a general class of solutions

here we want to study a class of su(2) matrices, and we want to show that, depending
on the imposed integrability conditions (see below), these su(2) matrices do provide
zero modes precisely when they are of the monopole type (i.e., they tend to the hedgehog
conguration for r  ). for this purpose we use a parametrization of su(2) matrices
that was used in [9] for a discussion of skyrmions. they use the ansatz for a class of
su(2) matrices u (in polar coordinates r, , )

u = exp(if (r)~n(, )~).

(30)

here the prole function f depends on r, and the unit vector ~n depends on , . therefore,
~n denes a map s2  s2 with integer winding number.
via a stereographic projection, the coordinate two-sphere (, ) may be mapped onto
the complex plane c with coordinate z. explicitly, the map is z = tan(/2)ei. in this
new coordinate, a class of unit vectors ~n(, ) may be expressed by rational maps z 
r(z) = p(z)
q(z) , where p, q are co-prime polynomials, and the degree of the map (the degree
of p or q, whichever is higher) equals the winding number of the map (, )  ~n(, ).
explicitly, ~n(r(z)) is

~n(r(z)) =

~n(z) =

1

1 + |z|2

(31)

(32)

in the sequel we will restrict to the simplest rational map r(z) = z (the identity map
s2  s2)

in the ansatz (30) for u we further assume, without restriction, that f (0) = 0, i.e.,
u(r = 0) = 1. then f () = 2k 
2 , k  z corresponds to a skyrmion-type su(2) eld
with baryon number (i.e., s3  s3 winding number) k. further, f () = (2k + 1) 
corresponds to a monopole-type su(2) eld.

2

therefore, we now want to prove that the ansatz

 = g(r) exp(if (r)~n(z)~)0 = g(r)[cos f (r)1 + i sin f (r)~n(z)~]0

(33)

may provide square integrable zero modes of the type i/ = h(r) for monopole-type
u but not for skyrmion-type u (all our above examples of zero modes are of this form
(33)).

we introduce the abbreviations

c(r) := g(r) cos f (r) , s(r) := g(r) sin f (r)

(34)

6

and, for further simplication, we use the fact that the matrix u acts on the spinor
0 = (1, 0)t, i.e., not all components of u actually occur in . this is best achieved by
introducing the matrices

(1 + 3) =  1 0
(1  i2) =  0 0

0 0 ! , p0  1

1p0 = p1 ,

1p1 = p0 ,

2p0 = ip1 ,
2p1 = ip0 ,

3p0 = p0
3p1 = p1

the spinor (33) may be rewritten like

 = [(c(r) + is(r)n3(z))p0 + is(r)n+(z)p1]0

where

n+ = n1 + in2 ,

x+ = x1 + ix2 ,

+ =

1
2

(1  i2).

acting with i/ on  gives

(35)

(36)

(37)

 i/ = [3(ic + sn3) + 2+(sn+)]p00 + [2(ic + sn3)  3(sn+)]p10. (38)

now we have to introduce polar coordinates (r, z, z),

and use (32) for our simple choice of ~n(z),

n+ =

2z

1 + zz

, n3 =

1  zz
1 + zz

to nd, after some algebra (here the prime denotes derivative w.r.t. r, not r2),

i/ = [ic n3 + s +

2
r

s]p00  in+c p10

!= h(r)[(c + isn3)p0 + isn+p1]0.

this leads to the two dierential equations

which we rewrite in terms of the functions

we arrive at

t(r) := tan f (r) =

s(r)

(44)

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

concerning the behaviour for r  , we want to discuss two conditions separately. as
a stronger condition, we require that the chernsimons action shall be nite (i.e., the
chernsimons density integrable), in addition to square integrability of the magnetic
eld and of the zero mode. explicitly, the chernsimons density for our ansatz (33) is,
after some computation (we use the notation of dierential forms here, i.e., a = aidxi,
etc.)

where

and

ada =

(50)

(51)

(52)

where h is given by (46). integrability of ada requires  6= 0, as may be checked
easily. in addition, square integrability of g (i.e., of the zero mode) requires   0 and,
therefore, we end up with the condition

 > 0.

(53)

next, we have to relate this asymptotic behaviour of t to the properties of the matrix u,
(30). for illustrative purposes, let us rst do it for the explicit example (22) (the third
power u 3 of the specic simplest matrix u, (16)). there we nd

t(r) = tan f (r) =

r(3  r2)
1  3r2

8

(54)

and therefore

tan f (0) = 0

. . .

f (0) = 0 ,

tan f (

1
3

) =  . . .

f (

showing that the topological number

n := (f ()  f (0))

2


= 3

(55)

(56)

is an odd integer in this case, and, therefore, the corresponding su(2) matrix is of the
monopole type. now this consideration may be immediately generalized to general t with
the behaviour (49), (53). from (49) it follows that

t(0) = tan f (0) = 0

. . .

f (0) = 0.

from (53) we conclude

t() = tan f () =  . . .

f () = (2k + 1)


2

, k  z

(57)

(58)

showing that square integrable zero modes have odd topological number n = 2k+1 and
are, therefore, of the monopole type, if the additional condition of nite chernsimons
action is imposed. on the other hand, when  < 0 (leading to a non-square integrable
zero mode), then

t() = tan f () = 0

. . .

f () = 2k


2

, k  z.

(59)

therefore, skyrmion-type su(2) matrices with even topological number lead to non-
square integrable, formal solutions of the pauli equation.

this is what we wanted to prove.
now we want to impose the weaker condition that the magnetic eld ~b be square
integrable. this does not give a condition on  at all. further, square integrability of
g just requires   0, where we have already discussed the case  > 0. so let us
investigate the case
(60)

 = 0 ,

t() = t = const.

a little bit closer. square integrability of g requires

therefore, now a broader class of zero modes is allowed, where the su(2) matrix u, (30),
may tend to a mixture of monopole and skyrmion for r  ,

u(r = )  cos f1 + sin fi~n~ ,

sin2 f > 3 cos2 f.

(62)

the authors of [1] observed that, in addition to their simplest solution (4), they could
nd similar solutions to equ. (2) with higher angular momentum. using instead of the
constant spinor 0 = (1, 0)t the spinor

ql  m + 1/2 yl,m+1/2

(where m  [l  1/2 , l + 1/2] and y are spherical harmonics), they found the solutions

this may be immediately generalized to our ansatz (33). for the spinor

5 the seibergwitten equations in three and four

dimensions

we begin with the four dimensional situation. let us choose an oriented, compact, closed,
riemannian 4-manifold m. given m, the data we need for the seibergwitten equations
are a connection a on a line bundle l over m and a local spinor1 eld . the seiberg
witten equations are then [7]

/a = 0,

f +
a = 

1
2

 

(74)

where /a is the four dimensional dirac operator coupled to a and  is made from the
gamma matrices i according to  = 1
a is just the self-dual part of
the curvature fa of a; we note that a is just a u(1) connection and so fa = da.
minima for the action

a solution pair (a, ) to the seibergwitten equations clearly provide the absolute

structureall that is used is the fact that m has a spinc structure something which orientability guar-
antees. this means that the bundle l has a local square root l1/2 but  should be thought of as an
l1/2-valued spinor rather than an l-valued spinor. also for comparison with the notation of witten [7]
we point out that the bundle l of [7] corresponds to the l1/2 of this paper.

where c1(l) is the chern class of l.

now we allow m to have a boundary m = m3, say, and this changes what happens
in passing from the rst form of the action to the second. the change occurs because
stokes theorem was used and the existence of m3 = m gives rise to a boundary term
which is the integral

(da  a)(cid:27)

(78)

where /da is the self-adjoint dirac operator in three dimensions coupled to a, and a is
the connection on m3 induced by the connection a on m, lastly dv is the volume form.
the critical points of this action on m3 are now given by the equations

/da = 0,

fa =

where now fa = da is the curvature of a and  denotes a spinor on m3we recall that
a spin structure on m induces one also on its boundary. one can think of the pair (a, )
as being the boundary values of the pair (a, ).
the signicance of the three dimensional seibergwitten equations is still not as clear
as it is for the four dimensional ones. the 3d equations are relevant, however, when one
takes two 4-manifolds m+ and m, both with boundary m3 and constructs a closed
4-manifold m by gluing m+ to m along m3, giving

m = m+ m3 m

(80)

cf. the solutions on tubes discussed in kronheimer and mrowka [8].

in the present case we want to remain in three dimensions and consider the fermion

zero modes we have already discussed in the previous sections.

6 an explicit solution of the 3d seibergwitten

equations

the zero mode we have encountered already, namely

obeys

 = (1 + r2)3/2(1 + i~x~)0, 0 =(cid:18) 1
0(cid:19)
e

/da = 0, with fa =

(1 + r2)2



12

.

12

(81)

(82)

we can easily check that if we renormalise  by the factor 1/24 then we have a solution
of the 3d seibergwitten equations for we still have

/da = 0

but now we also have

fa = 

1
2

giving the desired solution pair (a, ).

our solution is dened on r3 rather than a compact 3-manifold; this is similar to the
standard bps monopole which is also dened on r3. in addition, like the bps monopole
we have found that the behaviour of the eld on a 2-sphere s2 at innity is the relevant
one for determining its topology.

7 summary

for a whole class of zero modes (ansatz (33) with condition (47)) we have shown that
their existence is related to a topological quantization condition (the topological number
(63) is an odd integer) precisely when the additional requirement of nite chernsimons
action of the corresponding gauge eld (85) is imposed (geometrically, this topological
quantization condition implies that the associated su(2) matrix (30) is of the monopole
type). this result clearly points towards a topological origin of the whole problem, and
it may also be of some interest to chernsimons qft.

further, we have shown that the action (75) of the four-dimensional seibergwitten
equations on a manifold with boundary induces a three dimensional action term (78) on
the boundary, where the chernsimons term is naturally included. in addition, we found
that the zero mode (81) with corresponding eld strength (82) provide a critical point of
this three dimensional seibergwitten action.

from the above construction it seems that we related the existence of a square inte-
grable zero mode to a topological property of this zero mode (i.e., of the su(2) matrix
u) rather than of the gauge eld. this is not necessarily true, however. remember that
all our zero modes (33) are of the specic type

 = gu0 , i/ = h , ai =

h
2

tr u iu3

(85)

i.e., ai is related to the matrix u in a simple algebraic manner. this is true even for the
scalar function h, which is determined algebraically by t (and t) and does not depend on
g, see (46). therefore, the su(2) matrix u of ansatz (30) uniquely determines the gauge
eld ai via (46), (85), and it may well be that it is ultimately the topology of ai that
determines the existence of zero modes.

still, there remain many open questions. e.g., our ansatz (33) (or (67)) only provides
one zero mode per gauge eld, and it would be interesting to nd examples with more
than one zero mode (if they exist). further, one would, of course, like to understand,

13

which topological property determines the number and existence of zero modes in the
general case. these questions are subject to further investigation.

finally, we want to remark that an apparently obvious generalization to (33) does
not work. in (33) the simplest possible unit vector ~n(, ), (32), is used (corresponding
to the rational map r(z) = z). one may wonder whether new solutions may be obtained
by allowing for other unit vectors in (33), e.g., the ones with winding number m corre-
sponding to the rational maps r(z) = zm, m  2. the answer is no. the point is that
every zero mode has to obey the condition

~~ = 0.

(86)

if one inserts ansatz (33) with a higher winding ~n into this condition, one immediately
realizes that it cannot be fullled as long as both f and g only depend on r.
