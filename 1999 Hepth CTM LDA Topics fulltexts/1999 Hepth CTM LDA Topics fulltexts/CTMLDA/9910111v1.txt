correlation functions for chiral primaries

in d=6 supergravity on ads3  s3

six dimensional supergravities on ads3s3 present interest due to the role they play
in the ads/cf t correspondence. the correspondence in this case states the equivalence

between supergravity on the given background and a still unknown conformal eld the-

ory. the conformal eld theory in question is expected to appear by deforming of the free
conformal eld theory on sn (t 4) in a way which preserves the superconformal symmetry.

the purpose of this paper is to compute the rst nontrivial corrections to the equations of

motion for the chiral primary elds coming from supergravity. using the methods already

developed which involve nontrivial redenitions of elds, we compute three-point correla-

tion functions for scalar chiral primaries and notice similarities between their expressions

and those obtained in the orbifold conformal eld theory.

1. introduction

the correspondence [1] between cft and compactied supergravity on ads spaces

is a topic under vigorous current investigation. the rst check of the correspondence was

done by comparison of the spectra of chiral primaries in both theories and was followed by

comparison of three point interactions. such comparison involve computation of three point

greens functions in yang-mills theory (without interactions) and then, the evaluation of

the analogue three point vertices in compactied supergravity [2],[3],[4],[5]. an agreement

of the two (even for the range of couplings where it should not hold) is due to some rather

nontrivial nonrenormalization theorems.

one of the most interesting case of maldacenas conjecture is the one of iib string
theory compactied on a k3 or t 4 manifold [6]. here, a distribution of ve branes and
one-branes gives a black string whose near horizon geometry is ads3  s3  m 4. fur-
ther compactication on s1 produces a ve-dimensional black hole. its entropy is nicely
accounted [7] by a conformal eld theory with target space sn (t 4) or sn (k3). this

orbifold conformal eld theory was recently studied in a number of works [8], [9], [10]. in

[11], a suggestion that it originates in a non-commutative space-time was given, while the

nonlinear aspects of this conformal eld theory were discussed in [12].

in particular, a

construction of chiral primary operators was explicitely given and their operator products

evaluated. this gave specic answers for the three point correlation functions. the orb-

ifold framework allowed for a discussion of the corresponding spectrum generating algebra

which seems to govern the dynamics of the theory. it is clearly relevant to perform the

analogous calculations at the supergravity level. in this case, the relevant 6d supergravity
involves nontrivial multiplets which have their origin in compactication on k3 or t 4.

furthermore, the precise correspondence is actualy not known, in particular it is likely

that a deformed conformal eld theory might ultimately be relevant. even though some

of the deformations have been mentioned, explicite calculations were not done yet.

in this paper, detailed computations of cubic interactions among chiral primaries

of 6d supergravity will be presented. the computation involves the standard elements

of previous works, namely nonlinear eld redenitions, which then leads to three point

functions of chiral operators. the results presented at the end of section 4 have some

similarities in form with the previous examples done in the literature (which all have a

universal form in dependence on the chiral quantum numbers l) [13], [14]. in our case, we

observe for one sequence of operators a deviation from the universal form and a particular

1

quadratic dependence on the quantum numbers l. it is a very interesting question to ask

if a deformation of the free orbifold cft would give an identical result.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we give following [15], [16] the basic

notation and denition of 6d supergravity with the discussion of chiral primaries.

in

section 3 the action is expanded to cubic order and the nonlinear eld redenitions are

determined. section 4 discusses the corresponding correlation functions. some comments

on future work are made in the conclusions.

2. supergravity in d = 6

in this section, we review following [15], [16] the equations of motion of d = 6 super-

gravity of interest for us in determining the scalar chiral primaries. we are interested in
m n , br
the equation of motion for metric gm n , 2-forms bi
m n , i = 1..5, r = 1..n and scalars.
the scalars are packaged in a so(5, n) matrix v j
, i, j = 1..5+n giving a parametrization
so(5)so(n) . the integer n depends on the type of supergravity we study in
6d: for n = 4b supergravity, coming from a compactication of type iib supergravity

of the coset

so(5,n)

i

on k3, n = 21 and for n = 8 supergravity, coming from compatication of the same 10d
theory on t 4, n = 5. as long as we work with the metric, the scalars and two-forms only,

we can use n unspecied. we will use the following notation for indices: m, n = 0..5 are
d = 6 coordinates, ,  = 0..2 are ads3 coordinates and a, b = 1..3 are s3 coordinates.
we will also use gi = dbi.

we construct the following quantities which will be used in writing the equations of

motion in a compact form:

dv v 1 =(cid:18)

dm p ir

n = m p ir

n  qij

h i = gi v i

m p is

then, the d = 6 supergravity equations of motion are:

we consider a vacuum solution which is maximally supersymmetric in d = 6 and has the
geometry of ads3  s3 with radius and cosmological constant equal to one. it consists in
the corresponding metric gm n of the direct product of the two spaces and the following
ansatz for the forms and scalars: v = i5+n , g5
abc = abc and all the other
gs set to zero. in the previous equations  and abc are the volume forms on ads3 and
s3 respectively such that, abc =  abc is the volume form in six dimensions. we
will recover later by scaling arguments the radius dependence.

 = , g5

3. scalar chiral primaries

we parameterize the scalar manifold by introducing scalar elds ir representing a
5 n matrix  which gives the uctuations of v away from identity. we write all the elds
in second order in uctuations:

gm n = gm n + hm n ,
gi = gi + gi,

v =(cid:18) i5 + 1

2 t
t


in + 1

2 t (cid:19) ,

then, we write the quantities dened in (2.1) in this order and we obtain:

we focus now, on scalar chiral primaries only. as it was already shown in [16], they come
for r = 1..n from the equation of motion for the two-forms br and
from two sources:
scalars 5r, and for the last one from the equation of graviton and the two-form b5. we

also use the parametrization of the two-forms given in [16]. the forms are decomposed in

3

spherical harmonics of s3 and we use the gauge invariance and the allowed dieomorphism

invariance to reduce the uctuations to physical ones:

hab = n gab,

ha = 0,

h = m g + h

(3.3)

where h

() is the traceless part of the graviton uctuation on ads3.

let us start with the rst category of chiral primaries and solve the linearized equations

leading to those (see appendix):

(3.5)

(3.6)

from the a and abc component of the antiself-duality equation for the two-forms br.
we expand the scalars 5r and those used to parametrize the uctuations of two-forms
in the harmonic basis of s3 and we get after solving the constraint (3.5), a system of

equations , (3.4) and (3.6), which has to be diagonalized. we arrive at the following
denitions: for the chiral primaries sr i = 1
4(l+1) (5r i + 2(l + 2)u r i) and for the other
scalar tr i = 1
4(l+1) (5r i  2lu r i), where i refers from now on to the harmonic index on
s3 and l refers to the integer entering the casimir of that representation: l(l + 2). we also
have, if we put to zero all the elds except the chiral primaries: 5r i = 2lsr i , u r i = sr i.

for the second category, those coming from the graviton and one of the two-forms,

we have the following equations at the linearized level:

in

this equations qr

1,2,3,4 represent the second order corrections to the equations and
they are set to zero when we determine the linearized expressions for chiral primaries. we

1,2,3, q

solve again the constraints (3.8) and (3.9), and we obtain a system of equations (3.7) and

1

(3.10) which is diagonalized by the following expressions: the chiral primaries given by i =
4(l+1) (n i +2(l+2)u 5 i ), and another nonchiral primary scalar  i = 1
4(l+1) (n i +2lu 5 i ).
if we set to zero all elds, but the chiral primaries we obtain the following expressions:
n i = 2li, u 5 i = i. we solve also the linearized a part of the graviton equation
l+1()i. we note that in the above equations, namely

of equations of motion (in qs), for our purpouses being enough to compute only its rst

4. the action in ads3 for chiral primaries

we compute in this section the second order corrections to the equations of motion

for chiral primaries. we notice that some of the second order terms involve derivatives on

ads3 of chiral primaries. because a consistent eld theory believed to exist for the chiral

primaries requires the absence of these terms, we will redene the chiral primaries in such

a way that the new terms cancel the problematic terms. these redenitions of chiral elds

are also consistent to the fact that we named the chiral primaries after solving linearized

equations only. it will be intersting to test if using the full nonlinear expression for the

supersymmetry algebra and the conditions for a eld to be chiral we could conrm our

redenitions of elds.

let us write the expressions for the corrections using partial results computed in

appendix 1. we start with the corrections given in qrs:

ponding corrections for each i. for denitions and derivations for spherical harmonics

see appendix 2. here, we only repeat a few denitions:  = l(l + 2) are up to a minus
sign the eigenvalues of the sphere laplacian,  = l(l  2) are related to the masses of the
chiral primaries, c(i) is the normalization constant of the i-th spherical harmonic and is
obtained from the integral over s3 of the square of it, and c(i, i1, i2) is the integral of the
corresponding product of three spherical harmonics.

we solve rst the constraint (3.5) and from it we obtain:

u r i  x r i

c(i, i1, i2)

c(i)

(2l1( + 2  1)sr i1i2 +

+ ( + 1  2)(l2sr i1 i2 +

)).

(4.2)

we expand the equations (3.6) and (3.4) in spherical harmonics and for each i we sum
them with the followig weights: (3.6) with (l+2)
4(l+1) . in the end, we
obtain the following equation for sr i chiral primaries including second order corrections:

2(l+1) and (3.4) with

+ 2l(5r i1 ( + 2)u 5 i2 + 2(1u r i1 + 5r i1 )n i2))).

(4.3)

we use now the expression for the elds 5r, u r, u 5, n, h .. in term of chiral primaries
sr i and as it is expected, we obtain equations which have in the right hand side terms

6

involving derivatives  sr i. these terms suggest that the denition of chiral primary
elds is changed at the quadratic level. we remove the unwanted terms by redenitions

and we end up with the following rules which are applied in the right hand side of (4.3).
we consider s,  as generic elds which at the linearized level solve ( l1(l12))s = 0
and (  l2(l2  2)) = 0 respectively, and the rules are valid if the corrected eld
solves at linearized level (  l(l  2)l)... = 0.

(4.4)

we mention here, that the above rules are valid only for second order corrections and

they have to be changed or replaced for the higher orders. plugging in (4.3) the expression
for x r i

obtained from equation (4.2) and using then (4.4) to remove the derivatives terms



we will obtain the following equations :

where  = l1 + l2  l, 1 = l + l2  l1, 2 = l + l1  l2 and  = l1 + l2 + l.

we will work now, in a similar fashion the quadratic corrections to the equations

of motion for the chiral primary coming from the metric and one of the self-dual forms,
. there are two kinds of quadratic corrections: those which are quadratic in sr i and
those which are quadratic in i. we work each correction separately. we start with those

coming from the rst category (we will denote both in the same way, qs):

them back in the system of equations formed from (3.7) and (3.10). we sum then the
two equations with the appropriate factors:  1

4(l+1) for (3.7) and (l+2)

result is the linearized equation for i and its quadratic corrections. expressing all the

it is now possible to write the action compatible with the determined equations (4.5),

(4.9) and (4.11) whithout being necessary to compute from somewhere else the quadratic

terms. the d = 3 lagrangian, up to normalization constants, is:

5. correlation functions

in this section, we derive the needed constant required in equation (4.12) from the

higher dimensional theory and compute the cft correlation functions. we start with

a system of q1 d1-branes and q5 d5-branes in type iib string theory. we review the

decoupling limit following [1], [6] and deduce from it the constant required in the equations

of motion of d = 6 supergravity. the following constants have the known denitions: g

is the string coupling,  is the inverse of the string tension, v is the volume of t 4 and

2 is the d = 6 coupling constant. the d = 10 metric in the extremal case and

1

g6 = g/v
in the decoupling limit: r  0,   0, such that u  r

 is kept xed, gives:

ds2 = (

(5.1)

where xi, i = 5..9 have 2 period, and l2 = g6(q1q5)

following [1] we require the constants to be such that the radius of the sphere to be

one: l2 = 1. in this limit the volume of t 4 shrinks to zero, justifying the use of d = 6

supergravity coming from kk reduction of the 10d theory and the constant appearing in

the d = 6 action is given by:

1
62  n = q1 q5
g2

(5.2)

from now on, we use such units that the overall constant in front of the cft action

is only n , besides l dependence. for each chiral primary eld in supergravity there is a

9

corresponding one in cft and in our case the correspondence is : sr  o r and   o0.

6. conclusions

in this paper, we gave the calculation of three point interactions of chiral primaries

in 6d supergravity. deriving the interactions, we used nontrivial redenitions of the elds

which solved the linear equation of motion for chiral primaries. the reasons behind these

redenitions are still not clear. the justication in our case is to use them to remove

unwanted derivative terms in the second order equations of motion. the appearance of

the derivative terms shows in a way the lack in understanding of supergravity compactied

on spheres. it is after removing the derivative terms that we deal with a standard eld

theory in three dimensions. it would be very interesting to nd a less technical principle

to justify them in all orders. a step in this direction was made in [17] for a dierent case

than ours and for a much smaller number of elds, namely those appearing in a consistent

sphere truncation of the corresponding supergravity.

in section 4, we derived the three point interactions corresponding to the expected

conformal eld theory in two dimensions. if we compare results presented at the end of

section 4 with the three point interactions found in the free orbifold cft [12] there are

similarities, but they are dierent overall. the similarities show that it is still possible to

10

expect a gravitational theory to be equivalent to the orbifold cft, but the question is

which one. on the other side the dierences are expected since the two descriptions do not

sit at the same point in moduli space. a relevant role in this comparison is played by the

dynamical symmetry groups: on the gravity side there is a manifest so(5) for t 4 or so(21)

for k3, symmetry at the lagrangian level. the backround we used, respects this symmetry

and so does the expression for three point interactions derived in section 4. in the cft

only the so(4) or so(20) subgroup is present. at present, the dynamical mechanism by

which this is enlarged is not known. to achieve an exact comparison one should perform

analogous computations in a dierent gravitational background or equivalently have a

deformation of the cft. this interesting question is left for future studies.

7. appendix 1

we give in this appendix detailed formulas of rst ( upper index (1) ) and second

(upper index (2)) order variation of the d = 6 elds used in text.

we consider rst the metric, the christoel symbols and the curvature tensor:

(h p

m n =

m n + (2) p

we are intersted only when m = a, n = b and when the metric uctuation are

parametrized like in (3.3) and the results is:

we should also compute (7.1) for the case m = , n = a, but because the only thing we

extract from this is h, needed only in linearized approximation we refer to [16].

next we consider the forms and the scalars given in (3.2) and we need only the

uctuations in hodge duality for forms and in the covariant derivative for scalars, due to

metric uctuations:

(7.3)

using the denitions for elds, we obtain in a straightforward manner the equations given

in text.

8. appendix 2

we list in this appendix the formulas we need to know about spherical harmonics on

s3. we dene the scalar harmonics similar to [3], namely:

y i 

1
rl x(i1 ..xil)i

i1..il ,

(8.1)

where xi, i = 1..4 are four at coordinates, r = px 2

4 and the sphere s3 is
embedded as r = 1. the pharantheses (..) means like anywhere in text, the symmetrized
and traceless tensor and is form an orthonormal basis of constant symmetrized and
traceless tensors. from (8.1) is clear that y i does not depend on r, but only on sphere

1 + .. + x 2

indices. we also need:

bby i = l(l + 2)y i ,
bb(ay i) = (l(l + 2) + 2)ay i .

12

(8.2)

we dene  = l(l +2). considering the basic constants we need to compute and determine

all the other spherical harmonic related constants in term of these:

y iy i ,

c(i) zs 3
c(i, i1, i2) zs 3

y i y i1 y i2 .

(8.3)

we can now prove using eventually simple insertions of bb in the equations (8.3) the
following identities:

y i y i1 = c(i)i,i1 ,

ay iay i1 = c(i)i,i1 ,

zs 3
zs 3
zs 3 (ab)y i(ab)y i1 = c(i)i,i1 2

(8.4)

and

y iay i1ay i2 =

y i(ab)y i(ab)y i1 = (

(8.5)

we compute the constants dened in (8.3) using gaussian integrals in x-space and we

obtain the following:

c(i) =

2l(l + 1)

c(i, i1, i2) =

l!l1!l2!
2 !( 



2 ! 1

2 ! 2

2 + 1)!hi1 i2i,

(8.6)

where the last factor represents the possible contractions of all the indices of the three

normalized tensors.

after working everything out we write a d = 3 action responsible for the reduced (on
s3) equations of motion. it is the spirit of the correspondence to relate the higher dimen-

sional vertices to correlation functions in a conformal eld theory one lower dimension.

13

the explicit correspondence was given in [2] and we repeat here the results applicable to

our case. the two and three point correlation functions in a conformal eld theory are

completely determined up to a constant. we give below only the constants assuming that

the linearized equations are those of correponding chirals (  is a constant coming from
higher dimensional supergravity and  = l(l  2)):
