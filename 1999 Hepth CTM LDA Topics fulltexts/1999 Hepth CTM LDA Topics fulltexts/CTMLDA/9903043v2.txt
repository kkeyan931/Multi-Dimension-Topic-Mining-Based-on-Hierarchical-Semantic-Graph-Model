abstract

the m(atrix) model has a dual realization as iia superstring theory in the near-

horizon geometry of the supergravity d0-brane. the role of ads2 in this correspondence

is reviewed and some aspects of holography that it suggests are discussed.

the dynamics of n d0-branes of iia superstring theory at an energy scale e is de-

scribed, in the limit

e  0 ,

gs  0 ,

(1)

by a non-relativistic u(n) supersymmetric gauge quantum mechanics with 16 supersym-

metries, otherwise known as the m(atrix) model [1]. here,  is the inverse string tension

and gs is the string coupling constant. the m(atrix) model is just a d=10 super-yang-

mills (sym) theory dimensionally reduced to d=1. the (dimensionful) coupling constant

of this sym theory is

gy m = g1/2

s

()3/4 .

(2)

the group of symmetries of the m(atrix) model (excluding supersymmetries) is the

d=10 bargmann group, which is a central extension of the galilean group; the central

charge is the d0-brane mass. this group is a subgroup of the d=11 poincare group for

which a null component of the 11-momentum is central. the (super)bargmann invariance

of the u(1) theory follows from the fact that the action is the null reduction of the

action for the d=11 massless superparticle [2]; the extension to u(n) then follows from

the fact that the relative d0-brane coordinates of translation and boost invariant. we

conclude that the non-relativistic limit described above is equivalent to a limit in which

the spacelike circle of s 1 compactied m-theory becomes lightlike. it has been argued

that all degrees of freedom of iia superstring theory other than d0-branes decouple in

this limit [3], so that the m(atrix) model provides a denition of m-theory on a lightlike

circle, as originally conjectured [1, 4].

according to the m(atrix) model, the uv regime of d=11 supergravity is described

by the ir dynamics of the sym theory. but the ir limit of the gauge theory is its strong

coupling limit. this can be investigated in the limit of large n by t hoofts topological

expansion [5], for which the eective dimensionless coupling constant at the energy scale

e is

gef f (e) =

gy m n 1/2

e 3/2

.

(3)

the topological expansion is an asymptotic expansion in gef f . according to a general-
ization of the ads/cf t correspondence [6, 7], the dual asymptotic expansion in g1

ef f is
provided by iia supergravity in the background of its d0-brane solution [8]. in the string

where f8 is the 8-form dual of the 2-form ramond-ramond (rr) eld strength, 9 is
the hodge dual on e9, and h is a harmonic function on e9. the gs-dependence may be

determined from the solution with gs = 1 by means of the transformation

in coordinates such that

ds2(e

9) = dr2 + r2d2
8 ,

(6)

where d2

8 is the so(9)-invariant metric on s 8, we may choose the harmonic function h

to be

h = 1 + gsn  
r !

7

.

(7)

given the factor of g1

s

in f8, this choice corresponds to n coincident d0-branes at the

origin of e9. we can now rewrite h as

where

h = 1 +

g2
ef f (u)
(u)4

u = r/ .

(8)

(9)

the variable u has dimensions of energy. it is the energy of a string of length r, although

one should not read too much into this fact as u will shortly be seen to be merely a

convenient intermediate variable. for the moment we need only suppose (subject to later

verication) that low energy corresponds to the limit u  0. for any non-zero gy m
this implies gef f (u)  , which we need in any case for the validity of the dual iia

2

supergravity description of the d0-brane dynamics. the low-energy limit is therefore a

near-horizon limit in the sense that

h

(10)

there is a problem with this limit, however, because the string frame metric of (4) has a

curvature singularity at singularities of h, i.e. at u = 0.

although the string frame is natural in the context of iia superstring theory, it is not

obviously the preferred frame in the context of the m(atrix) model. of course, no frame

is really preferred because the physics cannot depend on the choice of frame, but there

may be a frame in which the physics is simplest. it was argued in [7] that the preferred

frame in this sense is the dual frame, dened for a general p-brane (up to homothety)

as the one for which the dual brane (the d6-brane in our case) has a tension independent
of the dilaton. in this frame, and for all p 6= 5, the singularities of the harmonic function
h in the p-brane metric are killing horizons near which the d-dimensional geometry is
adsp+2  sdp2 [9, 10]. this result generalizes the interpolation property of p-branes,
such as the m2,m5 and d3 branes, that do not couple to a dilaton [11]. for the d0-brane

the dual frame metric ds2 is related to the string frame metric as follows:

ds2 = (en)

2

7 ds2

st .

the factor of n is included here for later convenience. the d0-brane metric is now

ds2 = (gsn)

7 dt2 + h

and in the near-horizon limit we have

(11)

(12)

(13)

the singularity of the metric at at u = 0 is now only a coordinate singularity at a killing

horizon of u , but the metric still depends on the sym coupling constant. to circumvent

this, we dene the a new radial variable u (with dimensions of energy) by

u2 =

u 5
g2
y m n

.

(14)

for convenience we also introduce the rescaled time coordinate

the near-horizon d0-brane solution is now [7]

t =

e = n 1 [gef f (u)]7/5
f8 = 7n vol(s 8)

(15)

(16)

we recognise this as ads2  s 8, with standard (horospherical) coordinates for the ads2
factor. as u is now the only dimensionful variable it sets the energy scale for solutions

of the massless wave equation in the near-horizon geometry. this fact implies that an

infra-red cut-o of supergravity at length u corresponds, via holography [12], to an

ultraviolet cut-o of the d0-brane sym theory at energy u [13].

the ads2 metric has an sl(2; r) isometry group. this does not extend to a symmetry

of the full near-horizon solution because the dilaton eld is invariant only under the one-

dimensional subgroup generated by t, however, scale transformations generated by the
killing vector eld tt  uu take one hypersurface of constant u into another such
hypersurface, which leads to a rescaling of gef f (u). a hypersurface of constant u is thus

the vacuum of the m(atrix) model at coupling gef f (u). as we rescale u we go either to

a free theory with gef f = 0 at the ads2 boundary, which is obviously scale invariant,

or towards a strongly coupled theory at the killing horizon of t at u = 0. in order to
keep e small in the latter limit we must take n large. however, for any nite n the

eective string coupling constant will still become large suciently near u = 0 and the

iia supergravity description will break down. this is an indication that we should pass

to d=11 supergravity.

given that the full d0-brane solution (4) is the reduction of the m-wave, one might

wonder what the near-horizon limit of the d0-brane solution lifts to in d=11. in view

of the fact that the non-relativistic d0-brane action is the null reduction of the d=11

massless superparticle action, the obvious guess is that the near-horizon limit of the d0-

brane solution is a null reduction of the m-wave. this is true, in the following sense [14].

4

the m-wave metric is

ds2

11 = dudv + kdu2 + ds2(e

9)

(17)

where k is harmonic on e9; it is also an arbitrary function of u but in order to reduce

to d=10 we must choose it to be u-independent. the choice k = q/r7 where r is the

distance from the origin in e9 now leads to the d0-brane solution (4) after reduction
along orbits of the timelike killing vector eld u  v. this is the standard timelike
reduction. we may instead reduce along orbits of the killing vector eld u, which is

null at spatial innity. to this end we set v = 2t and write (17) as

ds2

11 = k(du + k 1dt)2 + k 1/2ds2
st

where

ds2

st = k

2 dt2 + k

(18)

(19)

is the string frame 10-metric. the iia solution resulting from reduction on orbits of

u is therefore the d0-brane solution in the near-horizon limit, i.e. with h replaced by
k = h  1.

it is satisfying that the dual supergravity description of n d0-branes for large n is

a wave solution because this is what one would expect from the bohr correspondence

principle. however, we have still to consider what happens at u = 0. in many cases,

singularities of iia solutions are resolved by their d=11 interpretation [15], but this does

not happen here. the singularities of the harmonic function k are curvature singularities

of the m-wave solution, so the d=11 supergravity description must break down there.

the reason that the iia supergravity dual description breaks down is that the eective

string coupling becomes large. while this implies a decompactication to d=11 it also

implies that the neglect of string loop corrections, and hence m-theory corrections in

d=11, cannot be ignored. these are uv corrections to d=11 supergravity that should

be determined by the ir physics of the m(atrix) model, but this is its strong coupling

limit that we hoped to understand via its supergravity dual.

although we have failed to learn much about the ir physics of the m(atrix) model

from its supergravity dual, we can presumably learn how to resolve the singularity of the

m-wave solution of d=11 supergravity from the ir physics of the m(atrix) model; it is

5

just that the m(atrix) model/ads2 correspondence doesnt help us to accomplish this.

on the positive side, it does shows that the m(atrix) model proposal is a close cousin of

maldacenas ads/cft proposal [16] (as argued by other means in [17, 18]). the latter

is generally considered to provide an illustration of the concept of holography [19]. if

this is extended to the m(atrix) model [20] and, more generally, to other branes then the

general statement would seem to be that the bulk gravitational physics is determined by

the physics of the matter on branes. m-theory provides a natural realization of this idea

(which is also suggested by the global nature of observables in general relativistic theories)

because the uniqueness of d=11 supergravity ensures the absence of bulk matter.

this is all rather similar to machs principle, as horava has previously pointed out in

the context of an alternative proposal for the degrees of freedom of m-theory [21]. the

utility of machs principle is rather limited for asymptotically at spacetimes because the

local inertial frames are then predominantly determined by the existence of asymptopia.

holography is similarly limited; its applicability to ads spacetimes is evidently linked

to the fact that timelike spatial innity can be interpreted as a brane. this limitation

would not be a problem if the universe were spatially closed, but this invokes cosmology

to resolve an apparently unrelated problem. perhaps this is an indication that they are

not unrelated and that a consistent nonperturbative formulation of quantum gravity must

incorporate cosmology.
