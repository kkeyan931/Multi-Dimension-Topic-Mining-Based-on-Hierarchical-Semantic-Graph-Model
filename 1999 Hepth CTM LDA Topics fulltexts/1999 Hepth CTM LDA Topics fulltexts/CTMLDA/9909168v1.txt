abstract

we discuss the explicit formulation of the transcendental constraints dening spec-
tral curves of su (2) bps monopoles in the twistor approach of hitchin, following er-
colani and sinha. we obtain an improved version of the ercolanisinha constraints,
and show that the corrigangoddard conditions for constructing monopoles of ar-
bitrary charge can be regarded as a special case of these. as an application, we
study the spectral curve of the tetrahedrally symmetric 3-monopole, an example
where the corrigangoddard conditions need to be modied. a particular 1-cycle
on the spectral curve plays an important role in our analysis.

1 introduction

bps monopoles for the su(2) yangmillshiggs gauge theory have been studied for
over twenty years, using a number of dierent approaches. twistor methods, relating
the solutions of the integrable dierential equations of the model to holomorphic vector
bundles over a so-called twistor space, were rst introduced by ward, adapting previous
work on the self-duality equations for the pure yangmills theory on r4. they enabled
solutions of magnetic charge k > 1 to be constructed for the rst time [15]. a twistor
approach intrinsic to the geometry of r3 was developed later by hitchin in [7] and [8]. in
his formulation, a monopole is associated to a spectral curve, a compact complex curve
in t cp1, the total space of the holomorphic tangent bundle of cp1, satisfying a number
of conditions which were stated in [8]. based on this approach, new solutions have been
constructed and new characterisations of monopoles developed; we refer to [14] for a brief
overview.

the (reduced) moduli space nk of gauge-inequivalent bps monopoles of a given
charge k is a (4k  1)-dimensional manifold, which has been described in several ways. if
we adopt the twistor formulation in terms of spectral curves, it can be characterised as the
space of complex curves in t cp1 satisfying a number of transcendental constraints. for
the case where the curve is nonsingular, ercolani and sinha attempted to formulate these
constraints explicitly in [4]; they followed essentially the method of hurtubise in [12],
who achieved a satisfactory description of n2. their approach leads to a method of
determining constraints on spectral curves by analysing objects of the function theory
obtained on them. these constraints parallel the corrigangoddard conditions [3] for
constructing su(2) monopoles, and we shall clarify how they relate to each other.

this paper is organised as follows. we start by introducing the relevant aspects
of the twistor approach for monopoles in section 2, in order to x the notation.
in
section 3, we review the method of ercolani and sinha, and present a new version (24)
of their constraint equations which involves a special 1-cycle c on the spectral curve. the
corrigangoddard conditions were originally formulated in terms of integrals around the
equator of cp1, but we show in section 4 how to interpret them equivalently as integrals on
the spectral curve. moreover, we establish that the conditions in the two methods agree
except for one detail: the corrigangoddard approach enforces c to be of a special sort,
namely a combination of lifts of the equator of cp1 to the spectral curve. in section 5,
we apply the ercolanisinha method to compute the spectral curve of the tetrahedral
3-monopole discussed in [9]. thereby, the corresponding 1-cycle c is determined and the
result shows that the corrigangoddard assumption about c is too restrictive in general;
we also consider the action of the tetrahedral group a4  so(3) on the homology of the
spectral curve and show that it leaves c invariant. finally, we present some concluding
remarks in section 6.

2 twistor methods for bps monopoles

magnetic bps monopoles with gauge group su(2) are dened as gauge equivalence classes
of solutions (a, ) to the bogomolny equations in r3

fa = a

(1)

satisfying boundary conditions (see [2]) that ensure niteness of the energy functional; here
a is a connection 1-form (with covariant derivative a and curvature 2-form fa), and 
(the higgs eld) a function, both taking values in su(2). such solutions can be interpreted
as particle-like solitons carrying discrete magnetic charge. they are associated with an
integer k  z (with k > 0 according to the sign in equation (1)), which corresponds to
the magnetic charge of the eld conguration in suitable units and classies the solutions
homotopically; we take k > 0 throughout. the bianchi identity together with (1) imply
that bps monopoles are also static classical solutions of the corresponding yangmills
higgs theory in the bps limit, in which the higgs potential is set to zero, and they
correspond exactly to the minima of the energy functional.

the equations (1) are integrable and their solutions can be studied using methods of
complex algebraic geometry. this was formulated by hitchin in [7] as follows. the space
t of oriented geodesics (straight lines) of r3 is a 4-dimensional manifold  a point on it
can be specied by a pair of vectors (u, v)  r3+3, where u has unit length and denes
the orientation of the line, while v gives the position of the point on the line closest to
the origin and is thus orthogonal to u. this manifold admits a natural integrable almost
complex structure, given at each point (u, v) by taking the cross product with u of each
of the pair of vectors representing a tangent vector. it turns out that t, endowed with
this complex structure, is isomorphic as a complex surface to the total space t cp1 of
the holomorphic tangent bundle to the riemann sphere. the isomorphism takes u to
the corresponding point in cp1 = s2 and v to the obvious complex coordinate on the
bre. we will consider the standard ane pieces u0 and u1 of cp1, identifying the ane
coordinate  on u0 with the stereographic projection from the south pole and letting 
denote the corresponding coordinate on the bre; thus a tangent vector  
| is assigned
the pair (, ). we let  be the natural projection t  cp1, given in these coordinates
by (, ) 7 , and denote again by u0, u1 the pre-images under  of the ane pieces of
cp1.
in the literature, t is often called mini-twistor space. it admits a real structure  :
t  t, which is the anti-holomorphic involution corresponding to the reversal of direction
of oriented lines in r3; it obviously has no xed points. in terms of our coordinates, it
can be seen to be given by

 : (, ) 7 (


 2

).

,

(2)

the group so(3) of rotations in r3 induces an action on t, which can be easily described
in the coordinates (, ) in terms of the corresponding p su(2) transformations: the

2

matrix

q

(cid:20) p
q p(cid:21)  p su(2),

|p|2 + |q|2 = 1

acts on the ane coordinate  as

 7

p  q
q + p

(3)

and this corresponds to a rotation by  around the direction n  s2 with n1 sin 
n2 sin 
the derivative of (3),

2 = im q,
2 = re p;  transforms by multiplication by

2 = im p and cos 

2 = re q, n3 sin 

 7



(q + p)2 ,

since it is the bre coordinate of t cp1 corresponding to . it is clear from the denitions
that the action of so(3) commutes with the z2 action generated by  .

for each s  r and k  z, we dene a holomorphic line bundle ls(k) on t through

the transition function

g(s,k)
01

: u0  u1  c 
7 es 
  k

(, )

with respect to the trivialising cover {u0, u1} of t; this denition is independent of the
stereographic projection used on cp1. we shall use the notation ls for ls(0) and o(k)
for l0(k). these line bundles play a role in the formulation of the twistor correspondence
for monopoles, which we now describe. to a monopole (a, ) we associate the complex
vector bundle e  t, whose bre at an oriented line   t is the complex 2-dimensional
space of solutions u :   c 2 to the equation

where  is the restriction of a to . the bogomolny equation (1) implies that e is
holomorphic; it can be regarded as an extension

(  i)u = 0,

0  l  e  (l)  0

(4)
of the line subbundles l  e of solutions decaying exponentially as t  , where
t  r is the natural coordinate on . it can be shown that, for any monopole of charge k,
l is isomorphic to l1(k); dierent monopoles correspond to dierent extensions e.
given the two short exact sequences (4), we consider the composite morphism l  e 
(l+), which denes a holomorphic section p of the line bundle (l  l+) = o(2k). it
will determine a compact curve s  t, which is given in our coordinates by an equation
(5)

p (, ) = k + 1()k1 + . . . + k() = 0

3

where each j is a complex polynomial of degree not exceeding 2j. notice that the real
structure  induces antiholomorphic morphisms l  l and thus restricts to a real
structure on s. this implies that the polynomials j in equation (5) must satisfy the
reality conditions

j() = (1)j 2jj(

1


).

(6)

it can be shown that the three independent real coecients of 1() may be interpreted
as giving the center (x1, x2, x3) of the monopole in r3,

1() = k(x 2 + 2x3  x+)

where x := x1  ix2, and are thus trivial moduli in the solution, related to the transla-
tional symmetry of (1). in the following, we shall only consider centred monopoles; these
are dened as having the origin as center and thus have 1() = 0.

in [8], hitchin proved that, conversely, any compact real curve s of the linear system
|o(2k)| on t for which l2|s is trivial determines a charge k monopole, which will be
smooth if the additional condition

h 0 (s, ls(k  2)) = 0

(7)

holds for 0 < s < 2. s is called the spectral curve of the monopole and completely deter-
mines the gauge equivalence class of the eld conguration. it encodes all the information
about the monopole; in particular, its genus g is related to the magnetic charge k by

and every symmetry of s is also a symmetry of the corresponding solution to (1).

g = (k  1)2

(8)

3 a new version of the ercolanisinha conditions

in [4], ercolani and sinha rephrase the condition of triviality of the line bundle l2|s in
terms of g equations involving periods of 1-forms on the spectral curve s. starting with
these equations, which they call the quantisation conditions, they propose an algorithm
for constructing monopoles in the case where the underlying spectral curve is nonsingular.
we now review their argument.

recall that when s is nonsingular the group h 0(s, 1

s) of global holomorphic 1-
forms on s is a nite-dimensional c-vector space, whose dimension is the genus g of
s. locally, these forms  can be described, using the adjunction formula, as poincare
residues of meromorphic 1-forms on t with at most simple poles along s. imposing global
regularity, it is easy to show that they can be written in our coordinates as

 = (cid:0)0k2 + 1()k3 + . . . + k2()(cid:1) d

p/

(9)

4

(on u0  s and away from the branch points of |s), where each j is a polynomial of
degree at most 2j with arbitrary coecients. it is clear from this formula that equation
(8) indeed holds.

from equation (5), it is clear that the spectral curve s can be described as a k-
sheeted branched cover of cp1, with projection |s : s  cp1. the reality symmetry
implies that the number of branch points is even and that they occur in antipodal pairs. to
dene the sheets of the cover, which we will label by integers 1, . . . , k, we have to introduce
appropriate branch cuts. we may start by choosing a great circle on the sphere passing
through no branch points, and joining the branch points in one of the corresponding
hemispheres by non-intersecting cuts; then we apply the antipodal map to these to get
further cuts joining the branch points on the other side of the great circle we have chosen.
to ensure that each sheet is simply connected, we have to make one last cut, connecting
the cuts introduced on the two hemispheres. for the spectral curves we shall consider
below, one can argue that this last cut has trivial monodromy and is thus unnecessary;
in this situation, the reality structure maps cuts to cuts and can therefore be described
in terms of the antipodal map together with an order two permutation of the sheets.

we will be interested in the local behaviour of certain meromorphic forms at the
points of the bre above 0, which we shall denote by 0j, j = 1, . . . , k, and assume to be
distinct; this is no loss of generality since there is the freedom of rotating the monopole.
consider the meromorphic function on s dened by / on u0  s; it is easy to see that
it has simple poles at the 2k points of (|s)1({0,}) and is holomorphic elsewhere. in
a neighbourhood of 0j,

d(cid:18)
(cid:19) =(cid:18)

j(0)

 2 + o(1)(cid:19) d

as   0,

(10)

where j() denotes the local solution of (5) on the jth sheet. given a global holomorphic
1-form , we introduce the notation gj for the coecient of  at the point 0j in terms of
the local coordinate , i.e.

|0j =: gj d|=0.

(11)

the triviality of the line bundle l2|s is equivalent to the existence of a nowhere
vanishing holomorphic section f ; with respect to the trivialisation of l2|s over the open
sets u0  s and u1  s, f is given by two nowhere vanishing holomorphic functions f0 and
f1 on u0  s, u1  s respectively, satisfying

f0(, ) = e2 

 f1(, )

for (, )  u0  u1  s. this implies that the meromorphic 1-forms d logf0 (:=df0/f0)
and d logf1 are related by

d logf0 = 2d(cid:18)

(cid:19) + d logf1

5

(12)

on u0  u1  s. notice that

i

d logf  2iz

 = 0, 1

(13)

for any homology 1-cycle   h1(u  s, z); moreover, these integrals are nonzero in
general, since the 1-forms d logf do not have to be exact. from equations (10) and (12),
we conclude that d logf1 must have the local behaviour near 0j

d logf1 =(cid:18)

2j(0)

 2 + o(1)(cid:19) d

as   0

in order for f0 not to have an essential singularity at 0j  u0  s.
it should be noted that the section f is uniquely determined up to a multiplicative
constant, since the quotient of f by any other nowhere vanishing section of l2|s yields
a global holomorphic function on the compact riemann surface s. notice also that the
modulus of this constant can be xed by imposing the symmetry

f1(, ) =

1

f0   (, )

since the right-hand side has the regularity and nowhere vanishing properties of f1, and

 changes sign under pull-back by  .

let {a1, . . . , ag, b1, . . . , bg} be a canonical basis of h1(s, z) = z2g, i.e. satisfying

the orthonormality conditions

(ai, bj) = ij,

(ai, aj) = 0 = (bi, bj)

(14)

for the intersection pairing. following ercolani and sinha, we apply the reciprocity law
for dierentials of the rst and second kinds (cf [6], p. 241) to an arbitrary holomorphic
1-form  and d logf1 to get

(17)

then equation (15) can be rewritten as

2

i(0)gi =ic

kxi=1

.

(18)

the existence of c  h1(s, z) satisfying (18) is equivalent to the line bundle l2|s
being trivial. unfortunately, the condition (7) which would ensure smoothness cannot
be implemented directly in the ercolanisinha approach if k > 2, but we can include
a weaker statement in the analysis as follows. since for k  2 there is an inclusion
h 0(s, ls)  h 0(s, ls(k  2)) given by tensoring with a section of o(k  2)|s, the
condition

h 0(s, ls) = 0

(19)

is necessary for (7) to hold. now we can repeat the argument above to investigate the
existence of global sections of ls|s, arriving at the same equation (18) with 2 replaced
by s, and we can conclude that there will be no nontrivial global sections of ls|s for
0 < s < 2 if and only if c is primitive in h1(s, z).
we can still simplify the left-hand side of (18). consider a global holomorphic 1-form

 on s, as given by (9). after dening the branch cuts, we can write

and so

p (, ) =

kyj=1

(  j()) ,

p


(, ) =

kxi=1

kyj6=i

(  j()) .

on sheet i,  = i() and all the terms in the sum above vanish except one,

we can use this to write the coecient gi in (11) for  as

=

kyj6=i

(i()  j()) .

gi =

so the left-hand side of (18) takes the form

2

kxi=1

i(0)gi = 2

0k1

kxi=1

(0) + 1(0)k2

i

(0) + . . . + k2(0)i(0)

(20)

this appears to be a very complicated expression, but we can simplify it considerably if
we make use of the identity

kyj6=i

taking xi = i(0), we obtain

and substitution in (18) yields

2

kxi=1
ic

i(0)gi = 20

 = 20.

(22)

(23)

(24)

so our version of the ercolanisinha conditions amounts to the existence of a primitive
1-cycle c such that equation (24) is satised for every global holomorphic 1-form , where
0 is the coecient in (9) for .

to prove (22), we rst note that the cases 0  n  k  2 follow from the n = k  1
case: a translation xi 7 xiy of all the xis leaves the denominators in the sum invariant,

kxi=1

(xi  y)k1

kyj6=i

1

xi  xj

= 1,

so by expanding the binomials and collecting equal powers of y we get the statement for
all 0  n  k  2. the proof of the n = k  1 case by induction on k is rather lengthy
and we prefer to argue as follows.
it is readily seen that the whole sum is symmetric
under the action of the symmetric group sk permuting the xis. reducing to a common
fraction yields as denominator

(x1, . . . , xk) =

kyi<j

(xi  xj)

and this polynomial is completely antisymmetric under sk; in fact, the space of an-
tisymmetric polynomials in k variables is generated by  over the ring of symmetric
polynomials. the numerator is then necessarily antisymmetric and a homogeneous poly-
nomial of degree 1
2k(k  1), which is also the degree of , so it has to be equal to  times
a constant. taking the asymptotic limit x1   in the original sum, we conclude that
this constant has to be 1.
it is convenient, when we come to investigate particular examples, to introduce
bases for both the global holomorphic 1-forms and the homology 1-cycles on s. an

s) corresponds to taking monomials r s for
obvious basis {(), 1    g} for h 0(s, 1

(25)

the condition (24) for a general  is then equivalent to the g conditions

ic

() = 21.

(26)

let us also x a canonical basis (14) for h1(s, z). the (g  2g) period matrix for s
corresponding to the two choices of bases is then dened as usual by p = [a|b], where
a and b are square matrices with entries

aj :=iaj

()

and bj :=ibj

().

recalling (17), equation (26) can now be written as

gxj=1

(ajnj + bjmj) = 21.

(27)

although the number of integers to be determined in (27) is 2g, they still have to
satisfy constraints coming from the reality structure of s. we prove below that these
imply that c is antisymmetric under the action of  on the rst homology group,

this imposes g linear constraints on the 2g components of c.
holomorphic,

in fact, since  is anti-

c = c.

(28)

(a, b) = (a, b)

for any a, b  h1(s, z), and this shows that the matrix  representing  in the canonical
basis (14) of h1(s, z) satises

where j is the matrix representing the intersection pairing in this basis,



t = j( 1)j1

j =(cid:20)

1g

(cid:21) .

9

(29)

(30)

since  2 = 12g,  is diagonalisable and has eigenvalues 1; then (29) implies that these
have to occur with equal multiplicities. hence the antisymmetric 1-cycles lie in a zg
subgroup of h1(s, z).

to prove (28), we consider the basis (25). since  is antiholomorphic, it pulls back
holomorphic 1-forms on s to antiholomorphic 1-forms and vice-versa; the forms above are
mapped as

(cid:18) r sd

p /(, )(cid:19) = (1)k+r+s+1(cid:18)r 2(kr2)sd
p /(, ) (cid:19)

(31)

for 0  r  k  2 and 0  s  2(k  r  2). using (31) and (26), we obtain

ic+c

(1) = ic

(1) +ic

(1) = 2  2 = 0

and for  6= 1

ic+c

() = ic

() +ic

() = 0 + 0 = 0

for some  6= 1. we conclude that the integral of any global holomorphic 1-form around
c + c vanishes, and this implies (28).
to illustrate how we can use the conditions (27) to determine spectral curves of
monopoles, we take as example the well-known charge 2 monopole ([12], [2]), which is
also considered in [4]. the general spectral curve for a centred monopole of charge 2,
after imposing the reality conditions (6), has the form

2 + (0 4 + 1 3 + 2 2  1 + 0) = 0

where 2 is real. the four roots of the polynomial in brackets occur in antipodal pairs;
we can use the so(3) action to take one pair to 1 and the other one to e2i, where
0    

4 . a further rotation by  7 ei then takes the spectral curve to

2 +(cid:16) 

2(cid:17)2(cid:0) 4  2 cos(2) 2 + 1(cid:1) = 0

(32)

where  is a real number to be determined in terms of .

equation (32) denes a double cover of cp1 with branch points at the four roots of

the polynomial in brackets,

w1 = ei, w2 = ei, z1 = ei, z2 = ei.

we will be interested in the generic case where s is nonsingular; this happens if and only
if all the points above are distinct. s is an elliptic curve and can be constructed by gluing
together two copies of the riemann sphere along two branch cuts, that we choose to be on

therefore m = 0, and n must then be a generator of z, which we can take to be 1,
obtaining

this can be checked to agree with the result of hurtubise [12]. note that in this case
equations (7) and (19) are equivalent, so the method recovers all nonsingular spectral
curves of (centred and suitably oriented) monopoles of charge 2.

in this example, the special 1-cycle c in equation (24) is thus a.
checked that it is antisymmetric under  . we point out that, although here

it is readily

ia

d log f1 = 0,

the a-periods of d log f1 do not vanish for general monopoles, and this cannot be avoided
by just rescaling f as claimed in [4]. this will be illustrated in section 5.1, where we
consider a monopole with a spectral curve of higher genus.

4 the corrigangoddard conditions

in [3], corrigan and goddard used the so-called ak ansatz of atiyahward for instantons
to construct a charge k solution to the bogomolny equations (1) with dimnk = 4k1 free
parameters. this construction was also obtained independently by forgacs et al. [5], and
has been applied [13] to study monopoles in situations where the equations involved are
simplied. unlike the method we presented in section 3, the corrigangoddard approach
does not assume smoothness of the underlying spectral curves; indeed, it can be used to
obtain for example the axially symmetric monopole of arbitrary charge k, whose spectral
curve is reducible to k spherical components.

in the notation we have introduced, the construction goes as follows. start with a
polynomial p (, ) as in (5), satisfying the reality constraints (6). orient the monopole
so that there is an open annulus a in cp1 which contains the equator e = { : || = 1}
but does not contain any of the branch points of |s. assume that a lifts to k disjoint
annuli on the spectral curve; then one can dene the branch cuts so that sheet j contains
one of the lifted annuli, which we denote by aj. on 1(a), consider the function

where j are some integers to be determined. this is a lagrange interpolation polynomial
in  of the k conditions that  should take the value ij on aj. for   a, dene the
functions r from the coecients of r in  as follows:

(, ) =: 2i

r()(cid:18)

these are (k  1)2 constraints on the k2 + 2k coecients of p (, ), just as one obtains
using the ercolanisinha algorithm. when the spectral curve is nonsingular, we would
expect them to be equivalent to (26). we now clarify how they relate to each other.

denoting by si the ith elementary symmetric polynomial in a given number of

variables, we can expand the numerator of (33) to obtain

si(x1, . . . ,bxj, . . . , xk) =

clearly, (1)jsj(1(), . . . , k()) are just the polynomials j() in (5) for each 0  i  k
(with 0 := 1). therefore, we can read o the functions r in (34) as

r() =

so far, we have shown that, for the jth term in the sum, the numerator depends only on
j() and . using (21), we can eliminate altogether the dependence on the functions

where ej := (|s)1(e)  aj is the lift of e to sheet j. the integrand no longer depends
on the sheet label. it becomes clear now how to write the left-hand side of the corrigan
goddard conditions as integrals over 1-cycles on s. if we dene the holomorphic 1-form
r on k
j=1aj to be the integrand in the above expression, then the conditions (35) and
(36) can be written respectively as

equations (37) and (38) are very similar to the version (26) of the ercolanisinha
conditions. in fact, they turn out to be precisely equivalent to (26), provided we assume
c to be of the form

c =

kxj=1

jej

(39)

rather than a general 1-cycle as in (17). to see this, we rst remark that all the integrands
in (37) and (38) are of the form (9), and hence global holomorphic 1-forms on s. for each
1  r  k  1, the highest power of  in the numerator of r never exceeds k  r  1,
and the coecient of kr1 can be seen to be equal to (2)r1. so multiplication of r
by  s with r + 1  s  r  1 as in (38) gives monomials in  of all degrees between 0
and 2(r  1) as coecients for kr1. we conclude that all the homogeneous equations
( 6= 1) in (26) can be obtained from (38) if we consider rst the 2k  3 equations
corresponding to r = k  1 and continue decreasing r down to 2, using at each stage
the vanishing of the integrals for greater r from the previous steps. the  = 1 equation
also agrees with (37), since we can use (38) and the coecient of k2 in the numerator
of 1 is 1. conversely, the ercolanisinha conditions in the form (26) also imply the
corrigangoddard conditions (37) and (38) if (39) holds.
the question to put now is of course: is the ansatz (39) for the special cycle c in
equation (24) valid in general? in the next section, we show that this is not the case, by
explicit computation of c for the tetrahedral 3-monopole.

5 the tetrahedral 3-monopole revisited

5.1 spectral curve

now we apply the method of section 3 to investigate the spectral curve of the tetrahedrally
symmetric monopole of charge 3. this was rst studied in [9], where the existence of the
monopole was proved by imposing tetrahedral symmetry to simplify nahms equations
and solve them in terms of elliptic functions. a numerical treatment of the adhmn
construction was developed and applied to this monopole in [10], which allowed the elds
to be computed and, using these, level surfaces for the energy density were plotted.

as in [9], we start with the ansatz

3 + ( 6 + 52 3  1) = 0

(40)

for the spectral curve s, where  is a nonzero constant to be determined; the reality
conditions imply   r. the branch points occur at the zeroes of the polynomial in
brackets,

w1 =

3  1
2

, w2 = w1, w3 = w1, z1 = 

3 + 1
2

, z2 = z1, z3 = z1,

2i

3 . these are equidistant points on the riemann sphere, antipodal in pairs,
where  := e
which are related by radial projection to the midpoints of the edges of a tetrahedron
inscribed in the sphere. in the conguration we have chosen, the tetrahedron has a vertex
at 0 and is oriented such that the radial projection of one of the three edges containing 0
passes through 1, as shown in figure 2.

to dene the branch cuts, we choose to connect the wis and the zis together along
arcs of circles centred at the origin and antipodal to each other as shown in figure 3. no
more cuts are needed, since each branch point is of cube root type and so any closed path
on cp1 enclosing zero mod 3 branch points lifts to a closed path on s. now we can label
the three sheets as before: for j = 1, 2, 3, we dene sheet j to correspond to the analytic
continuation j of

 7 j11/3 

3q 3 + 52  3

(41)

regarded as a germ at 1  c. in particular, notice that on each sheet  is indeed given by
(41) for all  in the annulus c := { : |w1| < || < |z1|}. with these conventions, it can
be checked that the rules for crossing the branch cuts are as given in figure 3, where the
encircled  signs mean that the label j is to be increased/decreased by 1 mod 3 when the
corresponding cut is crossed.

figure 3: branch cuts for the spectral curve of the tetrahedral 3-monopole

it is not hard to see that one obtains a compact riemann surface of genus four when
three copies of the riemann sphere are identied along the branch cuts as specied in
figure 3. in fact, by identifying three copies of the upper or lower hemispheres along
the pair of cuts as above, one obtains a torus with three discs removed; the circles of the
boundary correspond to the equators of the spheres we started with. gluing together the
two surfaces obtained in this way along their boundaries gives a compact curve of genus
four. this is sketched in figure 4; the three circles shown project under |s to the equator
e of cp1, and they will be referred to as the equators on a given sheet. we shall adopt

16

the convention of drawing the paths as dash-dotted, dashed or dotted curves if they lie
on sheets 1, 2 or 3, respectively.

figure 4: spectral curve of the tetrahedral 3-monopole

now we choose a canonical basis for h1(s, z) = z8 as in figure 5. the rst two
1-cycles a1 and b1 are drawn close to the cut connecting the zis so as to have the desired
intersection number; for a2 and b2 we choose the equator on sheet 2 and a distorted
meridian intersecting it as required; all the other intersections between these four 1-cycles
are zero. then we act with the reality map  on these cycles to get the other elements of
the basis:

a3 := a2, a4 := a1, b3 := b2, b4 := b1.

(42)

our choice of branch cuts is such that  sends cuts to cuts and hence maps a given sheet

also takes real values (cf equation (2)). we then conclude that sheet 1 is invariant under

homology basis is as drawn in figure 5, and all the remaining intersection numbers for
the elements in the basis are as required by (14).

our chosen basis for h 0(s, 1

(1) =

d

, (2) =

d

(43)

according to (31) these forms are pulled back by the reality structure as

(1) = (1),

(2) = (4),

(3) = (3),

(4) = (2).

(44)

we are now ready to compute the period matrix. the reality properties (42) and
(44) imply that the periods around a2, a1, b2 and b1 determine those around a3, a4, b3
and b4, respectively. for example,

b23 =ib2

(4) = ib2

(4) = b42.

this means that we only have to calculate half of the 32 entries of the period matrix.

and, using the relation (see [1], p. 559)

we obtain

our choice of a1 and b1 implies that the periods around these two cycles are related

by conjugation,

ai1 = bi1.

this follows from the fact that the paths   a1 and   b1 are complex conjugate, while

2() = 3()

from the denition in (41).

there remain eight integrals to be calculated. by resorting to numerical integration,
we have established that they are related to the periods around a2 by simple numerical
factors. the conclusion is that the two blocks a and b of the period matrix can be
written as

(47)

in section 5.2, we use a change of variables projecting s onto an elliptic curve to relate
analytically the two results.

the special 1-cycle c for the tetrahedral 3-monopole with a positive is

c = b2 + b3.

(48)

it is sketched on the riemann sphere in figure 6, after simplication using relations in
homology  for example, the sum of the three equators with the same orientation is
homologous to zero, which is clear from figure 4. clearly, it is not a combination of
a lift of equators, since the projections of b2 and b3 enclose dierent branch points on
the riemann sphere. in the next section, it will be proved that c is invariant under the
tetrahedral group.

5.2 action of the tetrahedral group
the spectral curve s dened by (40) admits an action of the tetrahedral group a4 
so(3) determined by p su(2) transformations on ; the corresponding rotations are the
symmetries of the tetrahedron drawn in figure 2. this induces an action on h1(s, z),
which we now describe.

recall that a4 is generated by the 3-cycle (123) and the double transposition
3 about the direction dened by the

(12)(34). we represent these as the rotation by 2
top vertex 0 of the tetrahedron in figure 2,

r :  7 e

respectively. later, we will also be interested in another element of order two,

v = r t r 2,

(51)

which corresponds to a rotation by  about the axis connecting w2 and z2. we also denote
by r, t and v the maps induced on s by (49), (50) and (51).

on the complex plane, r is of course just the rotation by 2

3 about the origin, while
t and v are elliptic mobius transformations of order two with w1, z1 and w2, z2 as xed
points, respectively. a way to visualize the action of t or v is to draw the (invariant)
circles of apollonius corresponding to the two xed points; the other four branch points
of |s all lie on one of these circles and it is easy to verify that they are permuted as
expected under the two transformations.
to describe the action of a4 on h1(s, z), we start by computing the matrices rep-
resenting the generators r and t . the eect of r is easy to understand, since it leaves
the three annuli over c = { : |w1| < || < |z1|} invariant. t is harder to describe since
it does not preserve the annuli, on which we can easily keep track of the sheet labels by
using the expression (41) for j(). but we can still use (41) when  is in the smaller
region c+  c, where

c := {  c  t (c) : im  > 0}

are mapped onto each other by t . denoting by c,j the intersection of (|s)1(c) with
sheet j, it can be concluded that t sends c,j to c,j1, where the labels are taken mod
3. the sheet that contains the image under r or t of any point on s can now be easily
identied from these data and analytic continuation. in particular, we conclude that the
1-cycles in our basis for h1(s, z) are mapped as shown in figure 7.

(cid:2)0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0(cid:3)t

and

(cid:2)2 4 4 2 2 3 3 2(cid:3)t

so we conclude that the special cycle c given in (48) is invariant under the action of a4.
notice that in (52) the rst vector is antisymmetric whereas the second is symmetric
under reality.

we can explore the action of the vierergruppe d2  a4 generated by the two
elements t and v to express the value  given by (46) in terms of elliptic integrals, as in
[9]. the actions of both t and v are much easier to describe in an alternative orientation
of the monopole, obtained by rotation of (40) under

then the spectral curve is taken to the form

identies points in the same orbit of d2, having the rst quadrant as fundamental region.
under the map induced on t cp1 by p, the spectral curve (53) goes to

w3 + 246i(z2  1)2 = 0,

24

which is a torus by the riemannhurwitz formula and corresponds to the quotient s/d2.
the two pairs of branch cuts on the original riemann sphere are both identied with a
cut connecting the new branch points 1,  and 1 along the real axis. with some care,
it can be seen that the image of the 1-cycle c in (48) can be identied with a cycle going
four times along the imaginary axis in the negative direction, on the sheet containing the
point (w, z) = (2 6231/3i, 0). on the other hand, it is easy to see that the 1-form (1)
is given by the same expression in the new orientation, and

thus we can write

now this has to be equal to 2 by (26). thus we get

6 discussion

the version of the ercolanisinha constraints that we derived in section 3 generalises the
corrigangoddard conditions to all monopoles with a nonsingular spectral curve. an
interesting aspect is the existence of a distinguished 1-cycle c on the spectral curve. the
premises in the corrigangoddard approach lead to the constraint (39) for c, but their
conditions are otherwise equivalent to equation (24). in section 5, we have applied (24)
to rederive the scale parameter  in the spectral curve of the tetrahedrally symmetric
monopole of charge 3. we also veried that this monopole provides an example where
our condition (24) can be satised but those of corrigan and goddard are not.

let us make some remarks about the nature of the special 1-cycle c. given a non-
singular spectral curve s in t, c is uniquely determined as the solution to equation (24);
we have established that it is always antisymmetric under the real structure. moreover,
although the left-hand side of (24) depends on the spatial orientation of the monopole, c
remains constant along the so(3) orbit of s in the moduli space nk. in fact, its com-
ponents in a given homology basis are integer solutions to a linear equation and cannot

25

change when the spectral curve is rotated, since the period matrix occurring in (15) never
becomes singular. this argument applies to more general deformations in nk that do not
pass through monopoles with a singular spectral curve. it also implies that c has to be
invariant under any rotational symmetry of the spectral curve, and this imposes further
restrictions  for example, in the case of the tetrahedrally symmetric 3-monopole that
we studied in section 5, this consideration together with the  -antisymmetry completely
determines c up to sign.

as implied in [4], the components of the 1-cycle c are the characteristics of the
line bundle l2|s and can thus be interpreted as giving the direction of the linear ow
determined by nahms equations on the jacobian of the spectral curve s. another inter-
pretation for c is aorded by equation (16). recall that the triviality of l2|s provides for
two nowhere vanishing functions f0 and f1 on the open sets u0  s and u1  s. we may
wonder whether we can dene logarithms of these functions. and of course the answer
is no: the nonzero components of c correspond to nontrivial periods of both d logf0 and
d logf1, and so they cannot be exact 1-forms. to dene the logarithms, one should elimi-
nate the 1-cycles correponding to the nonzero periods, by cutting s along their conjugate
homology 1-cyles in the canonical basis (14). but we can see from (17) that this is equiv-
alent to cutting s along c. the riemann surface of logf0 or logf1 is then obtained from
the cut surfaces u0  s or u1  s by analytic continuation across the cuts, and this yields
an innite cover of the original open sets. so we may regard c as a topological obstruction
to dening the logarithms of the nowhere vanishing functions f0 and f1 on the spectral
curve punctured at the points lying over  =  and  = 0, respectively.
we should emphasise that the ercolanisinha algorithm is still not sucient to
ensure smoothness of the elds if k > 2, since it does not include the condition (7). the
family of nonsingular spectral curves of monopoles has codimension zero in the family of
real curves in |o(2k)| satisfying equation (24), but the inclusion is proper in general. for
example, it can be shown that the icosahedrally symmetric curve

6 + ( 10 + 11 5  1) = 0

(54)

satises (24) for some constant , but not (7); this follows from the conclusion in [9] that
there is no 6-monopole with icosahedral symmetry. it is known [11] that an icosahedrally
symmetric monopole of charge 7 exists, and its spectral curve is reducible to a projective
line and a smooth genus 25 curve of the form (54), with  = 33( 1

3 )18

an interesting question is to understand how (24) degenerates when a spectral curve
becomes singular. some singularities arise by imposing interesting symmetries on the
monopoles, as in the case of the axially symmetric monopoles that we have mentioned
already. we may expect that the condition still holds for other singular spectral curves,
but it is not clear how the 1-cycle c is to be determined in general.
