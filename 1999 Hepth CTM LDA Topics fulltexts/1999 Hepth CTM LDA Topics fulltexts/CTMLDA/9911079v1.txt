abstract
we formulate the renormalization procedure using the domain wall regular-
ization which is based on the heat-kernel method. the weyl anomalies for
the 2d qed and 4d qed are correctly reproduced.
it is found that the
chiral solution produces (1/2)d/2  correct vales, where d is the space di-
mension. the renormalization procedure is newly formulated, where both
fermions and bosons (gauge elds) are treated on the equal footing. the
background eld method is quite naturally introduced. as for the treat-
ment about the loop-momentum integrals, an interesting contrast between
the fermion-determinant part and others is revealed. as explicit examples,
the mass and wave function renormalization of 4d qed are obtained at 1-
loop. we conrm the multiplicative normalization (not additive one), which
shows the advantage of no ne-tuning.

1 introduction

in the lattice world, the new era looks to begin [1, 2]. the so-called dou-
bling problem become claried and the chirality of fermions can be con-
trolled more eciently than before. we may say the new regularization has
been established in lattice. in accordance with this great development , the
counterpart in the continuum is progressing [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. the merit of
such approach is rstly that we can clearly understand the essential part of
the new regularization, which is often hidden in the complexity of the dis-
cretized model, and we can compare it with the ordinary regularizations used
so far in the eld theory. the continuum version, at least, should explain the
qualitative features in the numerical simulation data of the lattice domain
wall. secondly the new regularization established in lattice can be applied
to various (continuum) eld theories. the most important case seems susy
theories where the proper regularization respecting susy symmetry is still
lacking( for a recent good review, see [8]).

the domain wall approach so far, at least in the continuum approach, has
been focussed mainly on the fermion determinant with the external gauge
eld. (as for the lattice model analysis, the gauge eld quantum eect was
considered and the renormalizability was checked at 1-loop by [9].) clearly
the situation is not satised in that the gauge eld is not treated on the
equal footing with the fermion and that the perspective for the higher or-
der (beyond 1-loop) quantum eects is not taken into account. indeed the
fermion determinant could be the most delicate part among other parts, but
we must formulate it within the general setting in order to regard it as a new
regularization in the eld theory. this motivates us the present work.

recently a new treatment has appeared in the continuum approach[10,
11]. the main idea is the following. introducing the chirality into a system
can be regarded as a procedure to dene a direction in the system cong-
uration [10]. usually we introduce it, in the (massless) spinor system, in

2

terms of the projection operator (1  5)/2. right and left is regarded
as such congurations that the system is for or against the xed direction
determined by the eigen vales of the operator 5: 5r = +r, 5l = l.
here we should recall the facts: 1) the heat propagates in a xed direction,
that is, from the high temperature to the low temperture (the second law
of the thermodynamiocs) and, generally, the heat equation prescribes such
behaviour; 2) the famous procedure to introduce the heat equation into the
general quantum system is the heat-kernel method[12]. the fermion determi-
nant has been so often examined in this method. (the anomaly is formulated
in this standpoint in [13].) we have shown the above idea works well if we
look at the 4 dim theory from the 1+4 dim space.

we summarize this new treatment in sec.2. new results about 2d and
4d qed weyl anomalies are added. in sec.3, the renormalization procedure
is introduced and the (renormalized) eective action itself is used to derive
anomalies. at this stage, we still keep the gauge eld external in order to
make explanation simple. in sec.4 we take into account the quantum eect of
the gauge eld and the equal treatment of fermion and gauge elds is realized.
we do the fermion self energy renormalization explicitly. in sec.5, we present
the complete formulation combining the results of sec.3 and 4. finally we
point out that the domain wall regularization, as for the loop-momentum
integral, distinctly treats the fermion determinant part from other parts.

not take feynman propagator which has both retarded and advanced compo-
nents. we take the retarded and advanced propagators for (+)-domain and
(-)-domain respectively. (they are symmetric with respect to the positive
and negative energy parts.)

this relation shows the delicacy in taking the limit in the 1+4 dimen-
sional regularization scheme. the condition (ii) comes from the usage of
the regularization parameter m in (2), whereas (i) comes from the necessity
of controlling the chirality without destroying the system dynamics. note
the roles of the regularization mass parameter m for the t-axis and for the
x-axis are dierent. it restricts the conguration to the ultra-violet region
(t  |m|1) in the extra space, whereas to the infra-red (surface) region in
the real 4 dim space (|k|  |m|). in the momentum integral, the condition
(i) is taken into account, not by doing k-integral with the cut-o m but by
the analytic continuation in order to avoid breaking the gauge invariance.

the validity of the above regularization was conrmed in ref.[10, 11].
we found the analogous aspects to the lattice domain wall: the domain wall
conguration, the overlap dirac operator, the condition on the regularization
parameter m, e.t.c.. we also conrmed the chiral anomalies (for 2d qed,
4d qed and 2d chiral gauge theory) are correctly reproduced. one of
advantages of the present approach is the equal treatment both for the chiral
and for the weyl aspect of the theory. to see the situation, let us apply
the above regularization to the weyl anomaly calculation. we rst take the
simple model, 2d qed, for the later purpose. it is given, using the chiral
solution, as[11]

solution gives one fourth of it.

combined with the results for the chiral anomalies in [10, 11], we conclude
that the chiral solution gives (1/2)d/2 (d: space dimension) of the correct

kernel is reviewed in [11].

value of the anomaly coecients both for the chiral anomaly and for the
weyl anomaly. the use of the chiral solution reduces the degree of freedom
by half for each double dimensions. this phenomenon looks like contrastive
with the lattices doubling species phenomenon.

3 renormalization procedure

in this section and the next one, we develop how to use the domain wall
regularization in the general eld theory. we now introduce the counterterm
action [a] into the eective action [a]   ln z[a]:

bare[a]  [a] + [a]

,

(16)

in such a way that bare becomes nite. how to systematically dene 
and obtain the renormalization properties is the task of this section. let us
take the simple model of 2d qed for the explanation. we consider the case
 is made of local counterterms. from the power-counting analysis, we
know

[a] = cdiv z d2xa

2

,

(17)

where cdiv is some (divergent) constant to be systematically xed. now we
take the following renormalization condition on bare[a].

(18)

in order to regularize t-integral in [a], we introduce here another regu-

larization parameters  and t ( < t < t ,   +0 , t  +):

the origin of the extra axis. it can also be regarded as the minimum unit of

behaviors respectively. the relevant part is the order a2 term.

both weyl and chiral anomalies are correctly reproduced. 7 note that the
chiral anomaly derived by the jacobian, in [10], comes from o(a)-part of
g5m
 , whereas that derived here by the eective action comes from o(a2)-
part. (as for the weyl anomaly, the results by both approaches come from
o(a2)-part.)

we conclude this section with listing up all regularization parameters
introduced and compare them with the lattice situation. we have introduced
three parameters m, t, and . they should satisfy the following relations with
two variables: the 4-momentum k and the inverse-temperature t.

(25)

in the above, we clearly see an important feature of the parameter m. among
three relations above, the latter two are familiar ones. the interesting one is
the rst. so far (before the appearance of domain wall regularization) we do
not know such a regularization parameter that depends on the conguration
( specied by k and t in the present case) in this way. in the conclusion
of this paper, we will point out another important character of the present
regularization, which is obtained by the result above and that of the next
section.
in the lattice domain wall case, they introduce four parameters:
m0, a, ls, l[15]. the correpondence with the present case is

  ls, the total site number along the extra axis

(26)

the one extra parameter in the lattice comes from the fact that the extra
space is treated independently from the 4 dim space. it is adopted in the

7 as for the chiral anomaly (24), the result depends on the renormalization condition
(18). therefore this result (24) should be regarded that the consistent choice of the
renormalization condition exists. it looks the specialty of the 2 dim qed. there exits no

ordinary domain wall formulation, whereas the present one treats the extra
space as the space of the inverse temperature which appears in expressing
the determinant. in ref.[15], the 4 dim fermion mass mf is also introduced.
in such a case, we also introduce the mass parameter.

4 quantum eects of gauge fields and higher-

loops

we have discussed only on the fermion determinant for the external gauge
eld. in order for this approach to be regarded as an alternative new reg-
ularization for the general eld theories, the treatment on the gauge elds
should be promoted to the equal level to the fermion. the perspective for
the higher-loops should also be stated. we must treat both fermions and
gauge elds (bosons) on the equal footing. we devote ourselves on the point
in this section.

the present approach is quite naturally ts in the background eld method[16,

17]. we explain it taking again 4d euclidean qed as an example. the
quantum eect of both the gauge (photon) eld and the fermion is taken
into account. we consider the massive fermion.

sa(x  y)(i6   e /a  m)y = 4(x  y) , s(x  y)(i6   m)y = 4(x  y) .(35)
sa(x  y) and sa(x  y) are the background dependent propagators. all
these propagators are euclidean ones, therefore there is no ambiguity in the
choice of boundary conditions.

since we keep the linear relation in the choice of the redened quantum elds,
the jacobian, j, does not depend on quantum elds.

the 1-loop part in the integrand is just the quantity that we have discussed
in sec.2 for the case m = 0 ( sec.7 of [11] treats the case m 6= 0). up to the
lowest nontrivial order, j is obtained as

this corresponds to the 1-loop fermion self energy. see fig.2. because the
jacobian is decoupled from the main integral part, the regularization for
the divergences in (38) can be taken independently from the regularization
parameter m introduced in sec.2. the quantity to be regularized in sec.2
was det(6 +ie /a), while that in this section is roughly det(1+e2 1

quantities are divergent, but the presence of 1 inside of det-symbol , in the

latter quantity, makes no chiral problem. (1 denes the 0-th order (free)
propagator clearly. ) the (momentum) integral, corresponding to trace
in (38), is done by the usual way appearing in the standard eld theory text
book. we explain the eective-action calculation in the coordinate space a
little more.

combining the results in sec.3 and 4, we present the nal form of the renor-
malization prescription (, taking 4d qed as an example,) with the back-
ground eld gauge[17].

where the fermion determinant part only is regularized by the domain wall
regularization of sec.2, and other parts by the cutos for the t-axis:  < t <

8 in the present case, this result is rather trivial after we know that the jacobian j
decouples from the m -involved part (fermion determinant part) at (37). in the lattice,
the 4d fermion mass is essentially introduced as the coupling m1 between the walls at
the two ends. in this case, whether the renormalized mass is propotional to m1 or not is
highly non-trivial, because m could appear additively simply from the dimensional reason.
the numerical simulation supports the multiplicative renormalization. this fact is very
important for no ne-tuning (good control of the small mass fermion) and for the validity
of the chiral perturbation[18].

compared with the case in sec.4, we have the relation:

(46)

because the background gauge invariance is preserved. some comments are
in order.

1. note that the background eld gaguge lgauge in (43) is not taylor-
expanded. the superiority of (43) is that the eective action bare is
guaranteed to be gauge invariant. (compare it with the situation in
(27) and (28).)

2. at 2-loop and higher order, the gauge parameter suers from the renor-

malization eect.

3. the terms in the taylor expansion of l play the role of subtracting

sub-divergences in multi-loop diagrams.

through this analysis, the character of the domain wall regularization is
revealed. first point is the condition on the regularization parameters (25)
as stated in the text. the second point is the treatment for the fermion loop
(determinant) is dierent from the other types of loops which are irrelevant
to the chiral problem. the loop momentum for the former has the cuto as
|l|  m whereas that for the latter as |l|  1
 . the two cutos have the
relation m  1
 from the requirement (25). it is expected that the dierent

16

treatment does no harm to the nal physical results as far as the low energy
fermion and gauge bosons are concerned.

so far domain wall is discussed mainly for the determinant calculation for
the external gauge eld. in the present paper, we have formulated it into the
general eld theory framework, using the background eld method, where
the fermion and the gauge boson are equally treated. we can calculate any
term, in principle, of the eective action involving both fermions and gauge
elds. we have explicitly shown the renormalization for the fermion and
gauge wave functions and for the fermion mass. they agree with the known
results.
