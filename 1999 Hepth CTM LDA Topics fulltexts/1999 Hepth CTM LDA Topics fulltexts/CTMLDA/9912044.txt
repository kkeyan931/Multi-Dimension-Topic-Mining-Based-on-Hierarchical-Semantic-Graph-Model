(we make argument precise section ii.) since common lore says local quantum eld theory framework way reconcile quantum mechanics, poincare-invariance, macrocausality (see e.g. {$9507121$}), seem facing puzzle. explain below, lore incorrect one willing sacrice notion strictly local observable. see way modify axioms quantum eld theory impossible construct observables whose support compact set. theories local observables emerge distances much larger certain scale . nonlocal quantum eld theories sort called quasilocal, since violate causality distances shorter . conjecture lsts quasilocal quantum eld theories order n /ms. n number vebranes. quasilocal eld theory quite old subject (see {$9507121$} review). extensively studied 60s 70s attempts deal nonrenormalizable eld theories. main observation present paper known properties lsts seem perfectly framework quasilocal eld theory. link quasilocal eld theories lsts best seen holographic point view . holographic approach makes clear little string theories 2 properties similar local qfts. particular, operators (p) depend 6-momentum p whose correlators (= wightman functions) enjoy usual properties. peculiarity lsts correlators seem grow exponentially momentum space  (in local qfts wightman functions grow power). related fact exponential growth density states lsts {$9507121$}. importance exponential growth stressed aharony banks {$9507121$}. authors pointed exponential growth means truly local observables lsts exist. rather, wightman functions grow exp(p), minimal size observables probe order . aharony banks suggested exponential growth wightman functions momentum space dening property lsts. paper elaborate point made {$9507121$} clarify extent observables lsts localized. see exponential growth greens functions momentum space characteristic quasilocal eld theory. x-space coun- terpart fact quasilocal elds singular (but well-dened) distributions. corresponding test functions real-analytic cannot compact support. appreciate relation growth distributions momentum space properties test functions x-space, following one-dimensional example helpful. suppose want regard functions f(p) = eap one real variable p distributions suitable space test functions.

quantum eld theory local observables associated compact sets. according microlocality axiom, ob- servables commute space-like separations. thus looking structure algebra observables one reconstruct unambiguously causal structure space- time, i.e. position light-cones. words, one reconstruct conformal structure space-time. since general torus dual conformally equivalent, local quantum eld theory

argue little string theories kind quasilocal eld theories truly local observables. 6 3 little string theories quasilocal field theories 3.1 space test functions local quantum eld theory elds
