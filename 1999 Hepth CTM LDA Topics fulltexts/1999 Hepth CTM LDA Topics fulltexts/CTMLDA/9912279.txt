(references variety approaches self-dual dynamics found .) except one case, one might hope rst sight eliminate subtleties self-duality eliminating gp p > 5 using g = g treating gp p < 5 (or rather, potentials) independent variables. things simple. eliminating gps p > 5 unnatural since invariant -duality. moreover, gps dierent p coupled subtle way reinterpretation {$9710230$} rr charges (as argue) rr elds k-theory. makes subtle eliminate half them. goal present paper explain statements along line (1.1) mean say given self-duality rr elds interpretation k-theory. need rst precise framework interpret rr elds (as opposed charges) k-theory. subject section 2. brief, propose cohomology class rr eld type iia superstring theory spacetime x determined element k(x), type iib determined element k 1(x). (the relation stated eqn. (2.17) below.) precisely opposite relation charges; recall rr charge type iia takes values k 1(x) 1 (with compact support condition), type iib takes values k(x). section 3, discuss implement self-duality k-theory. this, follow framework described sections 3 4.3  (which recommended background present paper); summarize amplify key points. particular, mod 2 index certain dirac operator plays important role discussion. finally section 4, apply framework quantization conditions obeyed gps type iia. special case g4, shifted quantization law get obtained considering global anomalies membranes {$9609122$}. (that derivation formulated -theory applies equally type iia.) shifts get general natural standpoint brane anomalies, even though include branes derivation. shifted quantization laws cannot general naturally stated cohomology, general cohomological formula fermion global anomaly enters analysis. another reason important describe rr elds via k-theory instead cohomology. indeed, nding natural framework formulate shifted quantization condition g6 original goal present paper. started anomaly cancellation condition (4.4) hoped use understand kind objects rr elds are. proved dicult hard understand role fermion anomaly. following progress understanding self-duality rr elds k-theory , became clear, show section 4, framework fermion anomaly term quantization condition comes automatically. important role k-theory framework played eqn.

(4.4) fermion terms dropped. present paper, ns three-form eld h assumed vanish. including raises number new issues, hopefully addressed elsewhere . 2. rr fields k-theory considering type ii superstring theory, rr elds really interpreted k-theory, let us consider theory ordinary (p 1)-form potential cp1, eld strength gp, (d +1)-dimensional spacetime x. (in superstring theory, = 9.) work rst spacetime x = rm , r time direction spatial manifold. assume branes codimension p+1 2 serve magnetic sources cp1. (by replacing gp gp following, could similarly consider electric sources.) presence brane worldvolume w , gp obeys dgp = (w ), (2.1) (w ) (p+1)-form delta function poincare dual w . writing formula simple form would hold ordinary p-form elds (as opposed rr elds type ii, additional terms whose import discussed below). general, brane worldvolume w , (w ) closed (p + 1)-form denes element  h p+1(m ; z). thus, interpret brane charge situation element cohomology group. (2.1) says  form d(. . .), 1 cohomology class represents brane charge zero (or else equation gp solution). compact manifold without boundary, right answer: total brane charge identically zero. way often stated total charge associated abelian gauge symmetry vanishes compact manifold, since ux nowhere go. setting total brane charge zero, consider case noncompact boundary n . use term boundary somewhat loosely; typical case interest = rd, n sphere sd1 innity. even compact, (2.1) still implies  vanishes element h p+1(m ; z). however, assume w compact, consider  element compactly supported cohomology h p+1 cpct (m ; z). (2.1) says class  vanishes h p+1(m ; z), imply  vanishes h p+1 cpct (m ; z). reason even g-eld obeying (2.1) exists, may vanish innity. vanishing  element h p+1 (2.1) vanishes innity. cpct (m ; z) would imply exists solution g thus, regard brane charge element h p+1 cpct (m ; z) vanishes mapped h p+1(m ; z). brane charge, words, takes values kernel natural map : h p+1 cpct (m ; z) h p+1(m ; z) (2.2) 1 assume equation (2.1), stated dierential forms, approximation equation holds integral cohomology. 3 dened forgetting cohomology class compact support. far tried dene brane charge directly terms brane world- volume. however, often useful gauge theories dene charge terms behavior elds innity case, terms restriction gp n . indeed, seen two paragraphs ago brane charge vanishes gp vanishes restricted n , strongly suggesting brane charge measured restriction gp n . get description brane charge using long exact cohomology sequence pair (m, n ). reads . . . h p(m ; z) j h p(n ; z) h p+1(m, n ; z) ih p+1(m ; z) . . . . (2.3) relative cohomology h p+1(m, n ; z) cohomology compact support h p+1 boundary n . (2.3), learn cpct (m ; z). map j dened restricting cohomology class ker(i) = h p(n ; z)/j(h p(m ; z)). (2.4) shows brane charge determined cohomology class g-eld h p(n ; z), elements h p(n ; z) arise restricting n cohomology class considered represent zero brane charge. simple intuitive interpretation. g-eld n extends closed p-form brane source created branes. g-eld measureable n contribute brane charge, takes values quotient indicated (2.4). analog k-theory move type ii case, diers ways. g-elds even odd p, brane w supports chan-paton gauge bundle, number subtle corrections (2.1) involving lower brane charges {$9710230$}. thus, considering rst type iib, branes compact support space, brane charge element kcpct(m ), compactly supported k-theory . ensure equation rr elds solution, brane charge must map zero k(m ). thus, brane charge takes values kernel natural map : kcpct(m ) k(m ) 4 (2.5) forgets k-theory class compact support. case brane charge interpreted cohomology class, also want description brane charge measured terms rr elds innity. see form must take, look exact sequence k-theory counterpart (2.3). reads . . . k 1(m ) j k 1(n ) k(m, n ) ik(m ) . . . , (2.6) relative k-group k(m, n ) kcpct(m ), j map restricts k-theory class n . (this exact sequence used computing kcpct(m ) {$9901042$}.) periodicity theorem, k 1 k 1. see group ker(i) brane charge takes values alternative description: ker(i) = k 1(n )/j(k 1(m )). (2.7) interpret way case cohomology. k 1(n ) classies rr elds innity, k 1(m ) classies rr elds brane sources. rr eld n extends (as element k 1) require brane sources, brane charges classied quotient k 1(n )/j(k 1(m )). interpretation (2.7) thus forces us assert type iib rr elds (or n ) absence branes classied topologically k 1(m ) k 1(n ). extends relation k-theory rr charges asserted previous work. move analogous situation type iia. here, brane charge classied k 1. specically, brane compact support charge k 1 cpct(m ), (after requiring equation rr elds solution) brane charge takes values kernel : k 1 cpct(m ) k 1(m ). (2.8) again, express brane charge terms elds innity. exact sequence analogous (2.6) . . . k(m ) j k(n ) k 1(m, n ) ik 1(m ) . . . , (2.9) k 1(m, n ) k 1 brane charge takes values cpct(m ) j restriction n . hence ker(i) = k(n )/j(k(m )). (2.10) 5 interpret mean type iia absence branes, rr elds (or n ) classied topologically k(m ) (or k(n )). finally, type i, d-brane charge classied ko(m ) compact support condition. reasoning along lines leads conclusion rr elds x = r classied ko1(m ). arguments given slightly formal. conclusion absence branes rr elds spacetime x = r classied way k-theory seems reasonable way reconcile interpretation brane charge k-theory fact gauge theory, one expects able measure charges terms elds innity. since including rst factor x = r change k-groups, equally well say x form r , rr elds classied (for type iia, type iib, type i, respectively) k(x), k 1(x), ko1(x). finally, take additional leap assuming result special case x = r used motivate discussion. assume (in absence branes) rr elds arbitrary spacetime x, necessarily form r , classied topologically k(x) k 1(x) ko1(x). relation k(x) rr fields last statement raises following question, consider rst type iia. given element x k(x) determines rr eld g, de rham cohomology class g? answer question, go back case x = r . consider collection 8-branes 8-branes world-volume p , p point r, arbitrary chan-paton bundles (e, f ). congurations classied topologically (modulo brane creation annihilation {$9610234$}) k-theory class x pair (e, f ). crossing branes, de rham cohomology class rr elds jumps. jump determined couplings rr elds brane. relevant couplings determined {$9605033$}. usually expressed electric couplings total rr potential c = c1 + c3 + . . .. couplings zpm c pba (ch(e) ch(f )) , 6 (2.11) ch chern character. c2p1 potential rr eld g2p.

(both x oriented, natural left right.) (2.14) made duality transformation, replacing g g, (2.11) would replaced magnetic coupling branes, contributes bianchi identity. magnetic coupling included, bianchi identity becomes implies jump g form dg = 2(p)pba ch(x), gr gl = 2pba ch(x). magnetic coupling spirit derivation gave (in branes introduced magnetic sources), take (2.16) basic relation. course, since g supposed self-dual right hand side (2.14) (2.16) self-dual, one wonder equations mean. straightforward approach use self-duality eliminate (for example) g6, g8, g10, treating 7 independent elds g0, g2, g4. g0, g2, g4 one would use (say) magnetic coupling (2.16), magnetic coupling g6, g8, g10 included via electric coupling potentials c2p1, p 2, (2.11). section 3, follow general formalism one take arbitrary mutually commuting set rr periods independent variables. framework, codimension 1 submanifold spacetime x, restriction class k(x) k(m ) set commuting data treated classically unconstrained self-duality. framework, interpret (2.16) formula jumps cohomology classes gps p crossing brane. nally make proposal rr eld determined k-theory class. suppose situation, rr-elds classied left branes k-theory class a, right branes k-theory class b = + x. (2.16) expresses dierence g eld left right. let us assume = 0 g zero (in de rham cohomology) left brane. (2.16) determines g right brane, interpret rr eld k-theory class b = x: g(x) 2 =pba ch(x). (2.17) assume formula holds arbitrary spacetimes x absence branes, situation used motivate it. also need type iib analog (2.17). propose given formula, interpreted follows. rr elds type iib, absence branes, determined element x k 1(x). k 1(x) ek(s1x) (the subgroup k(s1 x) consisting elements trivial restricted q x q point s1). chern character ch(x) hence element even-dimensional cohomology s1 x. upon integration s1, maps element odd-dimensional cohomology x. abbreviate element ch(x) (not showing integration s1 notation). notational understanding, propose (2.17) type iia type iib. given type iia result, assuming type iib formula general form, unique formula type iib consistent requirement -duality type iia type iib case x = s1 . type i, propose rr elds determined x ko1(x) formula (2.17), interpreted along lines suggested last paragraph. 8 k-theory unbroken symmetries well classifying rr elds, also want classify symmetries. begin recalling case ordinary p-form elds. potential cp1 curvature gp gauge-invariance cp1 cp1 + dbp2, bp2 two-form gauge-parameter. unbroken gauge symmetry bp2 dbp2 = 0; classied mod bp2 bp2 + dap3 (for (p 3)-form ap3) modulo 2 shifts periods bp2. group unbroken gauge symmetries h p2(x; u (1)). group necessarily connected. considering long exact sequence cohomology derived coecient sequence 0 z r u (1) 0, (2.18) one show group components h p2 (x; u (1)) torsion subgroup h p1(x; z)tors h p1(x; z). analog type iia that, rr elds classied k(x), unbroken gauge symmetries classied k 2(x; u (1)) (which periodicity k(x; u (1))), group components torsion subgroup k 1(x)tors. faddeev-popov gauge xing, divide order group. type iib, group components unbroken rr gauge symmetry group k(x)tors, type ko2(x)tors. k-theory cohomology g/2 determined (2.17) integral cohomology class, (because fractions power series expansion pba ch) rational one. interpret rr elds gp simply p-forms, integral structure attempt dene torsion part gp. integral structure dened level k-theory, particular torsion rr elds type iia (in absence branes) simply torsion subgroup k(x). illuminating consider briey examples passage cohomol- ogy k-theory mixes rr forms.

(2.19) thus, situation, g4/2 integral, g6/2 general half-integral. half-integrality seen simplest cases brane physics? obvious case quantization g6 arises measuring ux s6 links d2-brane. (in case, ba, g0, g2 zero irrelevant, simplifying assumptions valid.) though c3(x) odd general, shown using index theorem dirac operator c3 even complex vector bundle s6, situation g6/2 integral. general, c3(x) even, obeys relation c3(x) = sq2(c2(x)) mod 2, sq2 certain cohomology operation (a steenrod square). view (2.19), means half integral part g6/2 determined g4. correlation g4 g6 typical illustration dierences k-theory cohomology, fact must taken account, along electric-magnetic duality g4 g6, detailed investigation properties. many subtleties rr elds, otherwise would described piecemeal, summarized deriving rr elds k-theory. another illustration consequences reinterpreting rr elds k- theory, consider torsion. way general attribute elements torsion subgroup k(x), call k(x)tors, cohomology classes x denite degree. example, x = rp7 (which arises orbifold studies considered {$9901042$}), even dimensional cohomology x sum z z2 z2 z2, summands h 0, h 2, h 4, h 6. however, k(x) = z z8, summand z corresponds h 0(x), summand z8 k-theory analog h 2, h 4, h 6 combined. so, rr elds interpreted k-theory, way make sense separately torsion part g2, g4, g6. generator z8 factor k(rp7) x = lo, l nontrivial line bundle rp7 (it exists unique 1(rp7) = z2) trivial line bundle. c1(x) nontrivial 2 terms formal roots xi chern polynomial, ch(x) = pi exi . assume xixj, c3 = pi<j<k g2 = 0, pi xi = 0. also c2 = pi<j xixj xk, leading algebra following formulas. 10 element h 2(rp7; z2). element 2x k(rp7) c1(2x) = 0, c2(2x) = c1(x)2 6= 0, proving 2x nonzero k(rp7). element 4x chern classes zero, nonetheless nonzero k(rp7). example thus also shows k-theory elements cannot always classied chern classes. 3. self-duality, theta functions, k-theory 3.1. partition function closed manifold describe interpret self-duality quantum rr elds light k-theory. precise, limit (small string coupling large volume) rr elds treated free elds, determine quantum partition function compact manifold x, absence branes. discussion largely reprise section 4.3 , repeated make paper readable, extra details. additional background partition functions self-dual p-forms p > 1, reader may consult  well section 3 . carry discussion type iia, brief comments later type iib type i. rst step introduce antisymmetric bilinear form ( , ) k(x). denition simply (x, y) index dirac operator x values x y.
