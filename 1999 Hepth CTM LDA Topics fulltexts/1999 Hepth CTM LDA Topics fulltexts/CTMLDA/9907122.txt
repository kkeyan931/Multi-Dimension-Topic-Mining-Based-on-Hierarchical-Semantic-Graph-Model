(2) (3) shall dene total (or external, cm, global) relative (or internal) variables: 1 2 x = (x1 + x2) , p = p1 + p2 , x = x1 x2 , p = 1 2 (p1 p2). (4) (5) (7) (8) (9) give name corresponding combinations free hamiltonians: = h1 + h2 , = 1 2 (h1 h2). (6) know that, no-interaction limit, shall get pair free dirac equations: (p10 h1) = 0, (p20 h2) = 0, depends x1, x2. let us also write iterated versions (p2 10 e2 1 ) = 0, (p2 20 e2 2 ) = 0 ei =qh2 = (~p2 + m2 ) 1 2 . interesting combinations obtained sum dierences equations (7) iterated equations (8): (p0 s) = 0, (p0 s) = 0, h 0 = 0, (p0 ) = 0 h 0 = 2p0= = p 2 0 2(e2 1 + e2 2 ) + 42, (h2 1 h2 2) = ss p0 . = 1 2p0 (e2 1 e2 2 ) = 1 2p0 5 (10) (11) (12) (13) 2.2 sazdjians explicitly covariant propagator. free propagator g0 written g0 = g02 (p10 + h1)(p20 + h2)12, g02 second-order (spinless) free propagator: g02 = 1 (p2 10 e2 1 + i)(p2 20 e2 2 + i) .

(18) propagator (16) could easily written covariant form contain operator . replace (p0) add spinor part (14), obtain sazdjians propagator  : gsz = 4i |p0| h 0 (p0 ) (p10 + h1)(p20 + h2)12 also written covariant form gsz = 2i (p p m2 1 m2 2 2 ) (p1 1 + m1) (p2 2 + m2) p2 1 + p2 2 (m2 1 + m2 2) + (19) (20) form exhibits pole p0 : gsz = 2i p0 + ip0 p0 + 2|p0| (p0 ) 12. (21) 6 2.3 covariant positive-energy projectors. combination two fermions opposite energy signs leads continuum dissolution external potential third particle added. operator would kill unwanted poles sazdjians propagator, could re-introduce without losing covariance. thus search invariant substitute . lorentz invariant operator forcing positive energy fermion could = (pi0)(p2 ) = (pi0 |~pi|) (22) sign energy invariant positive squared 4-momenta. taking product two operators (one fermion) replacing p0 gives 2 = (cid:18) p0 (cid:18) p0 2 + 1 ~p 2 ~p 2 2p0 2 | ~p1| + + ~p 2 2 ~p 2 2p0 1 | ~p2| + m2 2 1 m2 2p0 (cid:19) 2p0 (cid:19) . 2 m2 m2 1 (23) (24) (25) let us assume heaviest fermion fermion 2. write (23) = (cid:18) p0 2 + 1 q2 ~p 2 2p0 2 | ~p1|(cid:19) (cid:18) p0 2 + 2 ~p 2 q2 2p0 1 | ~p2|(cid:19) q2 = q ~p 2 2 + m2 2 m2 1 . sum arguments two p0| ~p1|| ~p2|. argument rst ( p0 | ~p1|+ q2)( p0 | ~p1| q2)/2p0, implies p0 must outside interval (| ~p1| q2, | ~p1|+ q2). combination two results implies p0 > | ~p1|+ q2. second brings supplementary restriction, argument always positive p0 > | ~p1|+q2. thus write = ( p0 | ~p1| q ~p 2 2 + m2 2 m2 1 ). (26) see projection operator introduces cuto high | ~pi| given p0. interesting write also terms hi, comparison ++ (h1)(h2) projector widely used us  others, also future use two-fermion plus potential problem. get = (pi0)(p2 ) = (pi0) (p2 i0 h2 + m2 ) = (cid:2)(p10) (p2 10 h2 1 + m2 1) (p20) (p2 20 h2 2 + m2 2)(cid:3)p0= . 7 (27) (28) p0 = constraint gives p10 = p0 2 + 1 h2 h2 2p0 2 , p20 = p0 2 + 2 h2 h2 2p0 1 (29) 1 = p2 20 h2 10 h2 also p2 2 last concerns heaviest fermion omitted. given bound state energy p0, eliminates mixed energy-sign continuum would share energy. p0 = s, (28) reduces indeed (h1)(h2). g. 1, draw map = 1 region (h1, h2) plane, p0 xed 2 (in arbitrary units) dierent values lowest mass m1 : 0, 0.5, 1 (solid line), 1.5, 2, 2.5 3 (while m2 take value larger equal m1). draw rst quadrant, ones mirror images rst one. = 1 region bounded two pi0 = 0 curves, independent masses, p2 1 = 0 curve corresponding lowest mass m1. quadrant, region divided four parts, corresponding signs h2 2 (as exemple, indicate partition m1 = 1, m2 = 1.1 case, p0 thus 0.1 threshold 2.1). external potential present, expressions positive denite, negative values bound states corresponding fermion external potential. 1 h2 1 m2 2 m2 widely used ++ (h1)(h2) noncovariant projector simply se- lects rst quadrant, = 1 region divided four symmetric parts, one quadrant, cuto high-|hi| values. moder- ately relativistic systems, important regions near (m1, m2) point. shall thus nally approach free propagator product covariant sazdjian propagator covariant projector: g = gsz . (30) 2.4 3d reduction two-fermion bethe-salpeter equa- tion. shall write free propagator sum zero-order propagator, plus remainder: g0 = g + gr. bethe-salpeter equation becomes inhomogeneous equation = g0k = (g + gr)k = + grk, = gk (= g(g0)1). (31) (32) (33) solving (formally) inhomogeneous equation (32) respect putting result (33), get = gk(1 grk)1 = gk (34) 8 obeys k = k(1 grk)1 = k + kgrk + ... = (1 kgr)1k (35) k = k + kgrk = k + k grk. (36) reduction series (35) re-introduces fact reducible graphs bethe-salpeter kernel, g0 replaced gr. equation (34) 3d equivalent bethe-salpeter equation. depends choice g. relative energy dependence eq.

(43) 9 2.5 covariant salpeter equation. bethe-salpeter equation instantaneous kernel (i.e. kernel indepen- dent relative energy) leads directly salpeters 3d equation : = 1 p0 + ip0 v v = 2i 12 k 2 = (h1) (h2) (h1) (h2).

(48) 3d equation would (41), potential v = 2i 12k (, ) (s)2 (49) k must built using instead . second term (46) contribute much practical calculations, often omitted. reason, shall omit second term (48) use simply present work. fundamental point view, however, use preserves particle-antiparticle symmetry important feature relativistic theories. 2.6 one-body limit. go center mass reference frame, write p0 = m2 +w1 (for p0 > 0 ) make m2 3d equation (41), get equation = 1 w1 h1 + v , v = lim m2 v. (50) 10 , showed 3d reduction performed propagator gsz, projector, leads 3d potential given v = (cid:20) v sz + v sz 1 p0 v sz + (cid:21) . (51) also showed limit v sz (let us call v c ) given limit born term (a coulomb potential qed). since limit (w1 | ~p1|), thus v = (w1 | ~p1|) v c(cid:18)1 (| ~p1| w1) w1 h1 v c(cid:19)1 (w1 | ~p1|). (52) equation (50) related equation c = 1 w1 h1 + v c c (53) describes light fermion 1 potential generated heavy fermion 2. = (w1 | ~p1|) c . (54) equation (50) thus exact equation projection (54) provided expansion (52) truncated. if, however, two-body potential trun- cated born term, one-body limit projection v c instead v. introduction projector destroyed exact one-body limit born approximation, would also case contin- uum dissolution-preserving operators like ++. 2.7 transition matrix elements. 3d mass shell transition matrix element 3d = v + v 1 p0 + p0 + ip0 2 p0 v + = 2i 12 (cid:2)k + k gk + (cid:3) (, ) k + k gk + = k(1grk)1(1 gk(1grk)1)1 k(1grk gk)1 = k(1g0k)1 = (55) (56) 3d = 2i 12 (, ) .
