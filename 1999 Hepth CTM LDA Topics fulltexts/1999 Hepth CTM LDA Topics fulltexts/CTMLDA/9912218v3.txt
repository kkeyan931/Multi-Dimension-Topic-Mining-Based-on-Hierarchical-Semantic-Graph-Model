abstract

we discuss the open descendants of diagonal irrational z3 orbifolds, starting from
the c = 2 case and analyzing six-dimensional and four-dimensional models. as
recently argued, their consistency is linked to the presence of geometric discrete
moduli. the dierent classes of open descendants, related to dierent resolutions
of the xed-point ambiguities, are distinguished by the number of geometric xed
points surviving the unoriented projection.

1 introduction

open superstrings models descend from oriented closed superstrings [1, 2, 3, 4], and
display the same level of consistency of their heterotic counterparts. however, for several
years they have been considered less attractive, since it was believed that weakly-coupled
heterotic superstrings compactied on calabi-yau threefolds could provide a natural
bridge between a unied theory of all interactions and the standard model [5]. even
the unusual low-energy properties of open-string models [3], a rst clear indication of
their potential, were not immediately appreciated. this viewpoint has dramatically
changed since weak/strong coupling dualities have eective led to the unication of
all ve known superstrings (heterotic, type i and type ii), that together with the
eleven-dimensional supergravity are now regarded as dierent asymptotic expansions of
m-theory [6]. moreover, the perturbative oscillations of d-branes, bps solitons carrying
ramond-ramond charges [7] that play a central role in the web of string dualities, are
described by open superstrings. these ndings have completely changed our picture
of how the standard model should be embedded within string theory or m-theory. to
wit, while in a heterotic susy-gut scenario the string scale and the planck scale are
essentially identied, in type i vacua both the string scale and the dimensions felt by
gauge interactions could be as low as a few tev. moreover, in type i vacua the gauge
elds generally invade only some of the dimensions, while the remaining ones, felt only
via gravitational interactions, could be far larger, and even of millimeter size [8]. in this
new kaluza-klein scenario, often called brane world [9], several fundamental issues
like the gauge hierarchy problem and the nature of supersymmetry breaking have to be
reconsidered. at any rate, type i vacua have a central role in this setting, but only a
limited number of them has been explored so far.

in this paper we construct a class of six and four dimensional type i vacua from non-
geometric z3 orbifolds of the parent type iib theory. the more familiar geometric
type i vacua are open descendants of type iib models obtained modding out the
closed spectrum with the world-sheet parity operator , that interchanges left and right
moving sectors, and adding suitable twisted states, unoriented open superstrings. from
a conformal field theory point of view, their construction translates into a set of rules
based on sewing constraints that, for a given left-right symmetric model, allow in general
several possible descendants [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. one has indeed the freedom of changing
the unoriented truncation of the closed sector (the klein-bottle amplitude) compatibly
with the crosscap constraint [12, 13, 14, 15] and of adding suitable boundary-states,
that may or may not [16] respect all the symmetries of the bulk. the nal ingredient is
the solution of tadpole conditions that x (partly) the chan-paton gauge groups. this
brings about a number of surprises. for instance, one can have type i models without
open strings [17, 18], while unconventional klein-bottle projections can even require
that supersymmetry be broken to lowest order in the open sector [19, 20] as a result of
the simultaneous presence of branes and anti-branes. these last models are the rst in

1

which supersymmetry breaking is a consistency condition rather than an option.

there is another possibility, that consists in dressing  with the action of involutions
i of order two. again, from a conformal field theory point of view, this is equivalent
to applying the construction not to the geometric type iib, but to a dierent parent
theory based on a dierent, non geometric, gso projection. rational models of this
type were studied very early in [3], but a closer look at the relation between the dierent
approaches can be very useful, and in particular shed some light on the generalization
of the intuitive concepts of d-branes and o-planes to non geometric settings [16, 21].

to be less generic, let us consider the open descendants of the type iib superstring
compactied on a z3 orbifold to d = 6. the geometric torus partition function corre-
sponds to the so-called charge conjugation modular invariant. the open descendants
of this model have been constructed by several authors both at rational [17] and at
generic points of moduli space [18, 22]. recently, another class of open descendants
was constructed in [23, 24] combining  with a conjugation of the complex internal
coordinates (and with a corresponding action on the fermions). the resulting models,
already known as open descendants of gepner models [17], i.e. at special points of
moduli space, exhibit some interesting properties. first, the spectrum includes twisted
open strings, and this feature, common to other non-geometric type i vacua [25], can
be interpreted in terms of d7-branes at angles. second, their consistency rests on the
presence of quantized geometric moduli (the o-diagonal components of the target-
space metric). these are also responsible for the rank reduction of the chan-paton
groups [24], much in the same way as the b-eld (now a continuous deformation) is
in the conventional case [4, 26, 27]. in this paper we explore further the world sheet
structure of these models, and show how they may be regarded as open descendants of
theories whose gso projections correspond to diagonal modular invariants. we also
extend the construction to four dimensional models that have similar properties.

the plan of the paper is the following. in section 2 we begin by discussing the open
descendants of the bosonic c = 2 diagonal z3-orbifold. this is useful to address the
behavior of the irrational deformations.
in section 3 we recover the six-dimensional
models of [23, 24] and extend the procedure to investigate additional models in four
dimensions. section 4 is devoted to our conclusions and to some conjectures. notation
and conventions are illustrated in appendix a.

2 the c = 2 diagonal z3-orbifold and its open descendants

a pair of bosonic elds compactied on a z3-orbifold of a two-torus can be described
by a single complex eld z modded out by the action of the orbifold group that, in the
k-th twisted sector, is

z( + 2,  ) = k z(,  )

,

(1)

2

where  = e2i/3. the partition function of the resulting theory can be written in
terms of a sesquilinear combination of chiral blocks (see appendix a). in particular, the
geometric orbifold corresponds to the so called charge conjugation modular invariant

tcc =

where  is the narain lattice sum and the factors of three are connected to the three
points xed under the z3 action. denoting by mi and ni respectively momenta and
winding modes, and letting

(5)

we set for simplicity b = 0 (i.e. y1 = 0 ), and once the lattice has been normalized
to have basis vectors of length 2 in r2 units, it is easy to recognize that a possible

choice for a sensible z3 action is x1 = 1/2, x2 = 3/2 and y2 = 3r2/. the

open descendants of this geometric orbifold have been analyzed in several contexts, and
result in a class of theories with only neumann strings (i.e. excitations of d25-branes if
one refers to the bosonic critical string theory, or of d9-branes in type iib) in the open
sector and with (bulk) twisted sectors owing in the tree channel, including massless
ones.

in order to produce a diagonal gso projection, one has to combine the orbifold action
(1) with an involution that conjugates the eigenvalues of the right-moving coordinates.
as observed in [23], this diagonal action is natural on the complex eld obtained t-
dualizing one of the real components of the eld z, rather than on the eld z itself. the
resulting open descendants, when dressed with type ii critical superstring coordinates,
are sometimes referred to as type i models, and may be regarded as orientifolds of
the type iia superstring [28]. coming back to the bosonic model, the torus partition
function displays neatly the diagonal combination

as also apparent when the same expression is written in terms of characters (see
appendix a)

td =

+ 3 ( 20 20 + 21 21 + 22 22 )

where the prime denotes a lattice sum without the zero-mode contribution. the crucial
point is now to understand how t-duality [29], that is a symmetry of the toroidal
partition function, can be combined with  on the lattice. typically, this can be done
using a reection with respect to some symmetry axis of the orbifold [23], and in the
z3 case one has two choices. the rst corresponds to a reection i1 with respect to the
diagonal of the unit cell (or, equivalently, with respect to the vertical axis) and leaves
invariant all the three xed points. the second, i2, is a reection with respect to the
horizontal axis, and leaves invariant only the origin. the two choices are connected to
dierent resolutions of xed-point ambiguities [30] and give rise to dierent modular
invariants, and thus to dierent klein-bottle projections. in ref.
[24] the reection i2
was related to i1 on a lattice rotated by an angle /6. if the t-duality is associated
to i1, the  projection xes states that satisfy the p = p condition, equivalent to
a slice of the lattice with n2 = 0, m1 = 0, with conventions chosen in such a way
that the complex coordinate z corresponds to i(x1 + ix2). the closed twist produces the
amplitudes (g,hh g,g) from the bulk term (g,h g,h), and the resulting klein-bottle
amplitude is

where, as usual, the powers of two account for additional dimensions and come from
the (omitted) modular measure. because of t-duality, the lattice sum in (8) contains
both momenta and windings. consequently, the transverse channel depends on a ratio
of volumes, and is independent of the radius r. the consistency of (10) is precisely

4

linked to the value of x2. it generalizes to the irrational case the property, familiar
from rational conformal field theory, that only the identity appears in the transverse
channel of diagonal invariants. the massless contribution is indeed

k0 =

2d/2

2

33 00

,

(11)

as expected from the complete projector in the tree channel.

to construct the annulus amplitude, two observations are in order. first, the trans-
verse annulus must contain only the states that can be reected from a boundary or,
equivalently, that are paired with their conjugates in the bulk gso. this amounts to
selecting terms with p = p. from (3) and the form of i2, it is easy to see [24] that only
m1 and n2 survive the projection, but with the additional condition that both 2x1m1
and 2x1n2 must be even. second, the chan paton matrices reect the structure of the
orbifold group [2], and in the z3 case one has

t r [ ak ] = n + k m + k m .

(12)

in the diagonal annulus amplitude, however, we expect both untwisted and twisted
chiral blocks, without projections. in other words, the traces of the breaking matrices
ak with k 6= 0 should vanish, allowing only a single chan paton charge. introducing a
suitable projector, the transverse channel annulus becomes

notice that, barring the overall phase that appear in the denition of hatted quantities
(see appendix a), a sensible projector requires 00 = 01 = 02 and the condition

in such a way that the massless term includes only the hatted identity:

m0 =

.

(18)

(19)

it should be appreciated that the transverse massless terms of k, a and m combine
to give a perfect square. it is also nice that the three amplitudes must contribute the
same coecient, so that the size of the chan-paton group in a critical model would
depend solely on the additional coordinates, with a rank reduction by a factor of two,
as already observed in [24]. as noticed before, the reection coecients in front of
boundaries and crosscaps are independent of the radius r. in type i vacua the sign 00
would be xed by the cancellation of the identity tadpole, as we shall see in the next
section. the matrix p 1 allows one to display the direct channel mobius amplitude

is manifestly compatible with the annulus amplitude of eq. (16) and allows both or-
thogonal and symplectic global chan-paton groups.
it is also interesting to look at i2, the reection with respect to the horizontal axis.
in this case, states satisfying the condition p = p ow in the direct klein bottle
amplitude, and only one of the chiral twist elds survives the unoriented projection,

and it is evident, comparing with (7), that one of the three degenerate twist elds
is diagonal while the remaining two are o-diagonal in the would-be resolved torus
amplitude. in (22), the projector is at work in the direct channel. consequently, even
if in the transverse channel windings and momenta are now shifted

notice that the sign 00 is xed in type i vacua by the cancellation of the 00 tadpole
while  determines the type of the chan-paton group, whose rank is reduced by a factor
of 2 as a result of the equality of the reection coecients for boundaries and crosscaps.

3 type i vacua in six and four dimensions

we now apply the results of the previous section to the construction of type i vacua
in six and four dimensions, starting from the corresponding diagonal z3 orbifold of the
type iib theory. in d = 10 d (d = 4 or 6), one can resolve the xed-point ambiguity
in several ways, allowing a number n =qd/2
i=1 ki (with ki equal to 1 or 3) of twist elds
associated to as many xed points in the direct klein bottle amplitude. we thus nd
three models with n equal to 1, 3 and 9 in d = 6, and four models with n equal to 1,
3, 9 and 27 in d = 4. using supersymmetric chiral blocks (see appendix a), the type

8

iib diagonal modular invariant is

(35)

that in terms of supersymmetric characters becomes

td =

+ 3d/2 ( 10 10 + 11 11 + 12 12 ) + 3d/2 ( 20 20 + 21 21 + 22 22 ) . (36)

from now on, we do not specify the explicit form of the lattice sums, that should be
clear from the previous section. in complete analogy with the c = 2 case

k =

1

2  00

d/2yi=1

k

i + n 10 + n 20 

,

(37)

and extracting the zero modes from the lattice sums, it can be written in terms of
z3-characters as

k =

2

[ 00 (

d/2yi=1

k
i ) + 00 + 01 + 02 +

+ n ( 10 + 11 + 12 ) + n ( 20 + 21 + 22 ) ]

.

(38)

it is clear from (38) that only the twist elds associated to n of the 3d/2 xed points sur-
vive the unoriented projection. exposing the transverse channel by an s transformation
gives

k =

(39)

and it is worthwhile to observe that, as in the c = 2 model, the complete projector is
restored in virtue of the right values of the x2 moduli in the compactied directions.
a single type of chan-paton charge is allowed in the annulus amplitude, that can be
associated to dirichlet (9 d/2)-branes at angles [23], the natural objects in the theory
after d/2 t-duality transformations. thus

notice that, in this case, the sign is xed by the tadpole of 00. from k, a and m we
get n = 2d/2, with symmetrization of the chan-paton charges for the gauge vectors in
four dimensions and antisymmetrization in six dimensions. as a consequence, all the
d = 6 models have an so(8) gfe group, while all the d = 4 models have an sp(4)
gauge group. their massless spectra are summarized in table 1 and in table 2.

the closed oriented massless spectrum of type iib on the z3 orbifold in d = 6 results
in n = (2, 0) supergravity coupled to 21 tensor multiplets. the unoriented truncation
produces n = (1, 0) models with 12 + n hypermultiplets and 9  n tensor multiplets.
the open sector adds the gauge multiplet and n + 1 hypermultiplets in the adjoint
representation of so(8). these models were already described in [24], and as open
descendants of gepner models in [17]. the model with n = 3 also corresponds to
it is
a recently described open descendant of a z3l  z3r asymmetric orbifold [25].

table 2: massless spectra of d = 4 models.

amusing to stress how all these descriptions are related to dierent resolutions of the
xed-point ambiguities in the diagonal modular invariant. it is also easy to check that
the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition

h  v = 273  29 t

(44)

is satised for every integer value of n between 1 and 9. as usual, the models with
several tensor multiplets are anomaly-free due to a gss mechanism [31, 32].

the four dimensional models are related to a compactication of the type iib on a
calabi-yau threefold with hodge numbers h1,1 = 0 and h1,2 = 36. after the unoriented
truncation, the massless closed spectrum contains the n = 1 supergravity multiplet
coupled to v = (27  n)/2 vector multiplets and to 10 + n + v chiral multiplets. a
gauge vector together with n + 3 chiral multiplets in the adjoint of the sp(4) chan-
paton groups results from the open and unoriented massless spectrum. these models,
dierently from the geometric open descendants [33], are not chiral and are clearly
anomaly-free. compared to the model with n = 27 (the true diagonal), the presence
of additional vector multiplets in the unoriented closed spectrum reduces the number
of marginal deformations.

4 conclusions and discussion

starting from a pair of free bosonic elds propagating on a z3 orbifold of a two-torus, we
have discussed the open descendants of the diagonal model. its consistency, as stressed
in ref. [24], is deeply connected to discrete values of some geometric moduli. in fact, the
diagonal gso projection results from the combination of the geometric orbifold action
and a t-duality. for the z3 group, on a two-dimensional lattice there are two possible
choices, corresponding to two dierent resolutions of the xed-point ambiguities, that
give rise to dierent classes of open descendants. we have then discussed the application
to (already known) six dimensional and to (new) four dimensional open descendants of
type iib z3 diagonal orbifolds. their spectra are parameterized by the number n
of xed points surviving the closed unoriented projection. in d = 6, n can take the

11

values 1, 3 and 9, giving rise to type i models with an so(8) chan-paton gauge group
in d = 4, n can be 1, 3,
and 13 + 2n hypermultiplets and 9  n tensor multiplets.
9 and 27, yielding non-chiral type i vacua with an sp(4) chan-paton gauge group,
v = (27  n)/2 additional vector multiplets and 13 + 2n + v chiral multiplets. an
inspection of the complete one-loop partition function and of the rational conformal
field theory examples suggests that all these models should be consistent for every
integer value of n between 1 and 9 in six dimensions and for every odd-integer value
of n between 1 and 27 in four dimensions. in order to implement this conjecture, one
should be able to nd a suitable involution that represents the combined action of 
and the t-duality on the lattice and leaves exactly n xed points invariant. this is not
allowed for orbifolds that are products of two-tori, but more complicated slices of four
dimensional or six-dimensional lattices could exist that realize this settings.

it would be interesting to extend this construction to open descendants of zn orbifolds,
and to investigate the possibility of introducing anti-branes in this context. notice that
we do not nd, for the z3 case, unsolvable tadpole conditions as in recently proposed
open descendants of the type iia in four dimensions [34]. finally, it should be noticed
that all these models are dened perturbatively and are tightly constrained by confor-
mal field theory consistency conditions on surfaces with boundaries and/or crosscaps.
this is true, in particular, for the six dimensional model with zero tensor multiplets.
one is not allowed to append to a given closed unoriented spectrum an open sector
that does not respect the aforementioned constraints. some recently proposed non-
perturbative orientifolds are built violating the anomaly-cancellation conditions and
calling for non-perturbative states that supply the missing multiplets [35]. we have
no way to check the consistency of these models, but certainly we are able to dene
perturbative orientifolds compatibly with the closed unoriented spectra of some of the
models of ref. [35].

6 note added

for the sake of comparison with [36], where models slightly dierent from these are
presented, we would like to add the following comments. actually, there are more
solutions, both in six and in four dimensions, connected to the presence of discrete
open-string wilson-lines [3, 4, 27]. in fact, the mobius-strip amplitude in (42) should

where  is a sign hidden in the lattice sum, as pointed out in section 2. comparing with
the annulus amplitude of eq. (40), one can see that  = +1 leads to orthogonal chan-
paton groups, while  = 1 leads to symplectic ones. the six-dimensional models in
table 1 correspond to  = +1, while the four-dimensional models in table 2 correspond
to  = 1. two other series of models, whose massless spectra are reported in tables 3
and 4, are thus available. notice that the closed spectra are equal to the previous ones,
but the open sectors are changed. in particular, in d = 6 one has the gauge multiplet
and one hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of sp(8), with n hypermultiplets
in the antisymmetric representation. eq. (44) is again satised, because the wilson
line aects both the vector and a corresponding untwisted hypermultiplet. the gauge
anomalies in the models with several tensor multiplets are again absent, due to the ggs
mechanism [31, 32].

13

in d = 4, one has the gauge vector multiplet and three chiral multiplets in the adjoint
representation of so(4), together with n chiral multiplets in the symmetric represen-
tation. all these models are not chiral and thus anomaly-free, and coincide with the
z3-models in ref. [36].

7 appendix a: notations and conventions

let us start by dening the chiral blocks for the c = 2 model describing a pair of free
bosons on the z3 orbifold. the chiral traces in the untwisted sector are

while in the twisted sectors

with  = e2i/3 and h = (0, 1, 2) mod 3. notice that 0,0 = 2.

where g, h  z3, the trace runs over the g-twisted sector with a plus sign for ns states
