abstract

we determine the thermodynamic stability conditions for near-extreme
rotating d3, m5, and m2-branes with multiple angular momenta. critical
exponents near the boundary of stability are discussed and compared with
a naive eld theory model. from a partially numerical computation we
conclude that outside the boundary of stability, the angular momentum
density tends to become spatially inhomogeneous.

periodic euclidean spinning brane solutions have been studied as mod-
els of qcd. we explain how supersymmetry is restored in the world-
volume eld theory in the limit of large spin and discuss the hierarchy of
energy scales that develops as this limit is approached.

i. introduction

mathematically, thermodynamic stability is equated with the subadditivity of the
entropy function. more precisely, suppose the entropy s is known in the microcanonical
ensemble as a function of the other extensive thermodynamic variables (like energy and
charge), which we will collectively denote xi. subadditivity of the function s({xi}) is
the condition

s({xi + (1  )xi})  s({xi}) + (1  )s({xi}) .

(1)

if the inequality went the other way, then the system could gain entropy by dividing
into two parts, one with a fraction  of the energy, charge, etc., and the other with a
fraction 1 . when the system satises (1), no such process is allowed by the second
law of thermodynamics, and it is in this sense that the system is thermodynamically
stable.

for black holes, perhaps a better way to think of (1) (though a more heuristic one)
is as follows: (1) is satised for all xi and xi in a suciently small neighborhood of a
given point in phase space if and only if it is possible for a black hole at that point
to exist in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath much larger than itself. a simple
example would be the reissner-nordstrom black hole in four-dimensional einstein-
maxwell theory with no electrically charged particles. near extremality, the specic
heat is positive, but far from extremality the specic heat is negative. if one starts
with the black hole in a state with positive specic heat and a temperature close to the
temperature of some thermal gas of gravitons and photons, then the black hole will
equilibrate with the thermal gas. on the other hand, if the black hole was in a state
of negative specic heat, then even if its temperature is arbitrarily close to that of the
thermal gas, the black hole will either emit faster than it absorbs or absorb faster than
it emits, and correspondingly get smaller and hotter or bigger and colder. there is no
bound on the runaway phenomenon except for the black hole to make the transition to
positive specic heat or else to absorb most of the matter in the universe (assuming the
universe is nite). that is what one means by instability of the initial conguration.1
for spinning d- or m-branes, the heat bath line of reasoning is questionable be-
cause it is not clear whether one can construct an appropriate heat bath. one could
perform the following gedanken experiment. start with an array of nearly identical
parallel spinning branes distributed through space, and ask whether, as they trade

1in this discussion we have assumed that the jeans instability of the thermal gas is
insignicantthat is, it enters into the problem with a much longer time-scale than the
time scale of equilibration between the black hole and the thermal gas.

hawking radiation among themselves, there is a process of equilibration or disequili-
bration among them. this is the standard trick of constructing an ensemble out of
replicas of a given system. the branes should equilibrate precisely when (1) is sat-
ised. however, there is a diculty: one has to estimate whether the time scale of
equilibration or disequilibration is faster or slower than the time scale on which the
gravitational forces between the replicas appreciably distort the array. near the phase
transition of [1], one expects the equilibration time scale to diverge, so the gedanken
experiment will become impractical (even by the standards of gedanken experiments)
close enough to the transition.

as a rst step we can think of a single cluster of near-extreme coincident branes
in a decoupling limit of the theory, where hawking radiation to the asymptotically
at region of spacetime is very slow. once we have analyzed the criterion (1) and
established the existence of unstable solutions (even in this near-extreme decoupling
limit), we can ask what form the instability takes. because the branes have spatial
extent, perhaps the most natural assumption is that the solutions which spin too
fast are unstable against distributing their angular momentum unevenly across their
worldvolume, somewhat analogous to the gregory-laamme transition [2]. we will
have more to say on this possibility in section iv.

the work of [1] illustrates that the thermodynamics of the d3-brane world-volume
theory, as read o from the bekenstein-hawking formula from the supergravity geom-
etry, is stable only on a restricted region of phase space. that is, (1) is guaranteed
to be satised only if the xi and the xi lie within the specied region. our rst goal,
which we pursue in section ii, is to extend the stability analysis of [1] from one inde-
pendent angular momentum to three, and to the case of near-extreme m5-branes and
m2-branes with two and four angular momenta, respectively. (the maximal number
of independent angular is the rank of the rotation group perpendicular to the brane).
we will restrict ourselves to the near-extreme limit of spinning branes. for d3-
branes, the string theory account of the microstates of the brane in terms of strongly
coupled n = 4 super-yang-mills theory is thought to apply in this limit. the near-
extremal spinning geometries have a near-horizon limit which is asymptotic to ads5 
s5, so if we employ the philosophy of the ads/cft correspondence [35], we would
say that the supergravity thermodynamics translates directly into a characterization of
thermal states of the gauge theory. instability is more of a surprise in this context, since
statistical mechanical derivations of thermodynamics as a rule imply subadditivity of
the entropy. the diculty of treating the strongly coupled n = 4 gauge theory at
nite temperature prevents us from deriving or disproving the instability from rst
principles. in section v we do however extend the simplied eld theory treatment
introduced in [1] to the case of several angular momenta, and we show that the results
are qualitatively similar to the supergravity predictions.

3

in section iii we discuss the supergravity predictions for critical exponents at the
boundary of stability. the maximal number of fractional critical exponents at a given
point on the boundary is the number of non-zero angular momenta. we show in
section v that similar critical exponents arise from the naive regulated eld theory
treatment for the d3-brane. our analysis is not detailed on this point.

in section vi we analyze the supergravity solutions wick-rotated to euclidean time.
we observe that the angular momentum amounts in eld theory to a twist imposed on
the r-charged elds in the eld theory: the eld theory partition function is altered
from tr eh to tr reh where r is an element of the r-symmetry group. it describes
the angle through which the brane spins during one period of the euclidean time. in the
limit discussed in [6] where angular momentum becomes large with energy held xed,
r  (1)f , so we wind up with almost supersymmetric boundary conditions. for m5-
branes compactied down to four dimensions, this leads to n = 4 super-yang-mills
theory with supersymmetry slightly broken by boundary conditions in the kaluza-
klein reduction. we review how the near-supersymmetry aects the proposals to use
spinning branes as holographic approaches to qcd, and we note a puzzle regarding
the energy scale of supersymmetry breaking and connement.

ii. thermodynamics of spinning branes

the supergravity solutions for spinning branes were constructed in [7].2 the metric
for the general spinning d3-brane and m5-brane can also be found in [9,10] and [11],
respectively. we are interested primarily in the thermodynamics, and this follows
directly from the general formulas of [8].

some parameters that enter into the thermodynamics of d3-, m2-, and m5-branes

are shown in the following table:

2unfortunately, the spinning m-brane solutions quoted in [7] have a number of typographical
errors. however, these general spinning m- as well as d-branes can be obtained in a straight-
forward manner from [8]. there the general d-dimensional rotating two-charge black hole
solutions (of toroidally compactied string theory) were given. the corresponding spinning
(d3, m5, m2)-branes are obtained by turning o one of the two charges of the (d = 7, 6, 9-
dimensional) black hole, and then lifting the solution in a straightforward way to ten and
eleven dimensions, respectively.

the approximate expressions are for the near-extreme limit,    with r held
xed. scaling out the power n p v from e, ji, and s allows us to write all subsequent
expression in terms of e, ji, and s alone. that all powers of v can be absorbed in this
way is dictated by the absence of any scale in the theory; that all powers of n can also
be absorbed seems to be telling us that the eective number of degrees of freedom is
on the order n p, as rst conjectured in [12]. we can form dimensionless ratios

a. grand-canonical ensemble

now we wish to ask in what region of phase space s is a sub-additive function of the
energy density e and the angular momentum densities ji. we regard the ji as thermo-
dynamic variables rather than xed parameters, and the requirement of sub-additivity
means that legendre transforms with respect to the ji as well as with respect to e are
invertible. thus, in the sense described in section iii a of [13], we are investigating
stability in the grand canonical ensemble. stability in the canonical ensemble, where
only the legendre transform with respect to e is required to be invertible, amounts to
positivity of the specic heat, with the ji regarded as xed parameters. we will treat

6

stability in the canonical ensemble in section ii b. we will exhibit evidence in sec-
tion iv that the grand-canonical ensemble is the relevant one when the world-volume
is large. all of our actual calculations will be done in the microcanonical ensemble,
that is writing s = s(e, ji).

the function yh = yh(yi) is complicated to express in closed form, since it is the

solution of a cubic or a quartic equation, cf. (5). using (9), we can write

s = 2ep/(p+1)yh  

ji

ep/(p+1)! ,

(10)

where p+1 = cp22p+1/(d  1)p, and the arguments yi of yh have been written out
explicitly in terms of the ji. fortunately, there is a more convenient way to judge
the subadditivity of (10) than brute force. for instance, one can require that e is
concave up as a function of s and the ji. or, most usefully, one can show that the
domain of stability is the maximal region including the points where all ji = 0 where
the temperature t = e/s and the angular velocities i = e/ji are one-to-one
functions of s and the ji. this is the criterion we will actually use.

by dierentiating the explicit expression (10) with respect to ji, one can show that

it is useful to dene the dimensionless ratios

xi =

yi
yh

= 2

ji
s

.

(11)

(12)

because of the scaling which follows from conformal invariance, any dimensionless
thermodynamic quantity (like ep/sp+1) can be expressed in terms of the xi. this is
true in particular of i/t : we have

the sum over j in w is over all the independent angular momenta, of which there are
(d  1)/2. the most straightforward way to prove (13) is to use the relations

the rst of these is a rephrasing of (5); the second follows from the rst by logarith-
mic dierentiation; and the third follows from (12) also by logarithmic dierentiation.
again because of the various scaling laws, the relations t = e/s and i = e/ji
are one-to-one if and only if (13) can be inverted to express the xi in terms of the
yh /yi. at the boundary of a region of xi-space on which (13) can be inverted, at

can show that w is nite on the entire region of stability, its boundary will be given

least one of the eigenvalues of the matrix h 
by the solution of deth 
factor of w (d1)/2qk

yi i goes to zero or innity. provided we

this determinant has a simple closed form:

d(xi) =

(d  3)p (1) + 2p (1)
(d  3)p (1)  2p (1)

where p () is dened by

p () = yk

k) = 1 +

x=1



 xi1>i2>...>i

yj=1

x2
ij .

note that d(xi) = 1 when all the xi vanish. thus the region of stability is the domain
including xi = 0 where d(xi)  0. if all but one angular momentum is zero, then

d(x) =

(d  3)  (d  5)x2
(d  3) + (d  5)x2

(18)

which indicates that the region of stability for a single angular momentum is x2  d3
d5.
apparently by coincidence, p = d3
d5 as well. the bound x2  p is in agreement with
equation (17) of [1] in the case p = 3, and with the bounds derived in [14] for p = 2
and p = 5.

it is straightforward to verify that the denominators of w in (13) and d(xi) in (15)
dier only by a factor p (1), and that both these denominators are nonzero and nite
throughout the domain including xi = 0 where the numerator of d(xi) is positive.
thus an equivalent condition of stability to d(xi)  0 is

(d  3)p (1) + 2p (1) = (d  3) +

our methods can also be used to judge the stability of rotating black strings in ve
and six dimensions arising from intersections of spinning m-branes: m5  m5  m5
for ve dimensions, and m5  m2 for six dimensions. because the world-volume is
eectively two-dimensional, one does not expect any phase transition at nite temper-
ature, on account of the mermin-wagner theorem [15]. indeed, it is straightforward
to verify by direct computation that the entropy function is subadditive.
it is also
possible to trace through an analysis like the one in section ii, introducing a combina-
tion of parameters rd3
cosh i sinh i for each constituent family of branes,
and verifying that (16) is always satised. (we note however that (19) is not always
satised for the six-dimensional case: a zero in the denominator of (16) cancels a zero
in the numerator.)

b. canonical ensemble

for the sake of completeness we also derive the subadditivity constraints for the
canonical ensemble. this is the case where the angular momenta (charges) of rotating
branes are kept xed, so that subadditivity of the entropy is exactly equivalent to
positivity of the specic heat at constant ji. as we will demonstrate, it may be dicult
to keep the ji uniform over the entire world-volume outside of the grand-canonical
region of stability. however, uniform ji will be our working assumption in this section.
it is a general result, demonstrated in section iii a of [13] and veriable directly from
comparing (22) to (20), that the region of stability in the canonical ensemble is larger
than in the grand canonical ensemble. the canonical stability constraints for spinning
branes with one angular momentum were rst studied by cai and soh in [14].

a special case a single angular momentum turned on, say, x1 = x 6= 0, these stability

constraints reduce to:

d3 : 2 + 5x2  x4  0 ,
m5 : 1 + 4x2  x4  0 ,
m2 : 1 + 2x2  0 .

(23)

which are identical to the constraints derived in [14]. note that the m2-brane with
a single angular momentum is always stable, but that with two angular momenta or
more an instability is possible. (for example, when one approaches criticality along

xc  2.118431 and xc  2.193567 for n = 2 and n = 3, respectively.)

in the following section we shall further discuss the features of both ensembles in

the domain near criticality.

iii. critical exponents

we will focus on the grand canonical ensemble. critical exponents characterize the
behavior near a critical point of the grand potential, also called the gibbs potential,

the expression (24) for  is in terms of the xi, and it is straightforward to make a
taylor expansion around a point xic on the boundary of stability. there is no singular
behavior in this expansion. however, if  is expanded around the chosen point xic in
powers of ici, there are in general fractional critical exponents, ci. the number of
directions in which there is non-analytic behavior of  as a function of the i depends
on the number of zero eigenvalues of the matrix: aij  2yh
at the boundary of the
stability. the reason for this is that

yixj

aij

(26)

xk |xl=xlc(xj  xjc)(xk  xkc) +   ! .

i  ic = 2 aij|xk=xkc(xj  xjc) +
the matrix aij|xk=xkc has at least one zero eigenvalue on the boundary of stability, so
there is at least one direction with a fractional critical exponent. at special points on
the boundary, there may be more, and/or there may be directions in which not only
the rst but also the second term of (26) vanishes. to investigate the possibilities, let
us rst dene

xk  xi

u1

ki xi ,

(27)

where u is a matrix which diagonalizes aij, and uik for xed k is an eigenvector with
zero eigenvalue. if also

akkk  xijk

u1

ki ujkukkaijk = 0 ,

where aijk  aij

xk |xl=xlc, then the expansion (26) yields a relationship

if not, then

xk  xkc  (k  kc)1/3 .

xk  xkc  (k  kc)1/2 .

the expansion of (24) takes the following form:

11

(28)

(29)

(30)

 = c + c (1)(xk  xkc) + c (2)(xk  xkc)2 +   
= (analytic) + ck(k  kc)2k +    .

(31)


k

the second line of (31) is a denition of k. larger k means more singular behavior.
depending on whether (29) or (30) holds, k  z/3 or k  z/2. one or more of
the coecients c (i) can vanish, and this also aects the value of k. if k > 1 then
jk =  
is singular. from calculations in the microcanonical ensemble we know
that this does not happen. therefore one or more of the coecients c (i) must vanish.
rather than embark on an exhaustive investigation, let us examine some particular
cases. namely, let us take set n angular momenta equal, so that x1 = . . . = xn = x, and
send x to its critical value xc with the other xi vanishing. in this case the expression
for the common value  of i  i
t in terms of x can be inverted explicitly, and it takes
the form:

x =

1

2n+3d (cid:18) 2

 (cid:17)2
  [(cid:16) 2

+ (2n + 3  d)(d  3)]1/2(cid:19) ,

(32)

half integer powers appear in the expansion of x around  c when (2n + 3 d)(d
3) < 0. this occurs for the following cases:

n = 1, x = s d  3
d  5
for m2.

n = 2, x = 1

for d3, m2, m5 ,

(33)

in these cases k can be half-integer along the direction we have specied (that is, n
equal xis approaching their critical value).

in order to determine when aij in (26) has multiple zero eigenvalues, an ecient
method is to determine the entire locus of points where the polynomials in (20) vanish.
let us call one of these polynomials p(xi), and note that p = 1 . . . n up to a factor
which is never 0, where i are the eigenvalues of aij|xk=xkc. the locus p = 0 is the union
of the vanishing sets of the i. at a generic point on p = 0, only one i = 0. near a point
of p = 0 where the vanishing set of one eigenvalue crosses the vanishing set of another,
the equation p = 0 does not dene a manifold; rather, it denes two or more manifolds

crossing. we can nd these points by solving p = 0 and dp  p d1
2 

dxi = 0
simultaneously. for the m5-brane, there is no solution: f = 0 truly denes a manifold,
and the two eigenvalues of aij never simultaneously vanish. for the d3-brane and
the m2-brane, the only solutions are where all x2
i = 1. for the d3-brane, this is a
branch point where two sheets of p = 0 cross, and correspondingly two eigenvalues of
aij vanish. for the m2-brane, three sheets of f = 0 cross, so three eigenvalues of aij
vanish. in general, the number of eigenvalues vanishing at a branch point is indicated

p

i=1

by the lowest degree term in the taylor expansion of p around the branch point: that
is, the order of the branch point.

iv. phase mixing

one point on which our understanding is still very incomplete is what happens
to spinning branes with angular momentum so high that they are outside the stable
regime. for the sake of specicity, let us consider n coincident d3-branes with only
one angular momentum. in the notation of [1],
(j/v )4

puts us outside the region of stability as calculated in the grand canonical ensemble.
there are several possibilities: for instance, the d3-branes could vigorously shed their
angular momentum by a radiation process, or they could split into two or more clusters,
in a process somewhat analogous to the fragmentation of ads2 spaces considered in [16].
in an examination of the radial potentials for closed string emission and for equatorial
motion of a test d3-brane in the background of n spinning d3-branes, we found no
evidence for a special unstable mode developing at  = 1/3. this is not necessarily a
problem: as commented upon in the introduction, the nature of the instability is not
so much that there is some runaway mode of the system by itself, but rather that it is
impossible to establish equilibrium between it and a heat bath.

whether or not an unstable mode develops at some value of , one can argue from
thermodynamics that a sort of ads fragmentation is entropically favored for  > 1/8.3
suppose the the n d3-branes split into k equal fragments. as the fragments y apart,
they can acquire orbital angular momentum. as an idealization of this complicated
dynamical ssion process, let us suppose that most of the angular momentum winds up
in the orbital motion of the fragments, and that most of the energy winds up in their
non-extremality.4 as a further idealization, we will assume that the process occurs
uniformly across the d3-brane world-volume. by compactifying the world-volume on
a small t 3 one could ensure such uniformity. from [1] we take the formula

s(e, j; n) =

(35)

25/433/4ne3/4
q1 +  + 

3we thank f. larsen, e. martinec, and p. kraus for a stimulating discussion in which this
calculation was suggested to us.

4if we accounted for the energy that goes into hawking radiation and the motion of the
fragments, the bound would be  > 0 for some 0 > 1/8.

13

for the entropy per unit world-volume in terms of the energy and angular momentum
per unit world-volume. since we will be considering dierent values of n, we have
reverted to the conventions of [1]: e = e/v , j = j/v , and s = s/v , without the
factors of n 2 in the denominator which we used in section ii. the ratio of the entropy
of the nal state (k identical non-spinning fragments) to the initial state (a single
cluster with spin) is

sf
si

=

ks(cid:16) e

k(cid:17)
k , 0; n
s(e, j; n)

= vuut

1 +  + 

k

.

(36)

the process is entropically favored if sf > si, which is equivalent to k  1 + +.

kinematics forbids the k = 1 process, so we get the lowest critical  from k = 2 (two
fragments):  > 1/8, as advertised. with k = 3 (three fragments) we get  > 1/3,
which coincidentally corresponds exactly to the boundary of the domain where s(e, j)
is subadditive. making the fragments unequal just increases the bound. for very large
, large values of k will be accessible, and we interpret the fragmentation as a jeans
instability of the disk of d3-branes described in [9].

as in the thought experiment involving an array of branes which we discussed in
the introduction, there is a problem with time scales. since fragmentation process
violates the singularity theorem, we expect it to take place slowly. is there anything
else that might be quicker? the focus of this section is to examine the possibility of
spatial inhomogeneities on the world-volume of the brane. such inhomogeneities might
nucleate locally on quite short time scales (on the order the inverse temperature, up to
dimensionless quantities), so if they are thermodynamically favorable we expect them
to take place faster than ssion processes.

the reader may prefer to think in terms of holography: the near-extreme d3-brane
solution is a limit of an r-charged black hole in ads5 whose radius is much larger than
the radius of ads5, and whose holographic representation is a thermal, r-charged state
of the conformal eld theory on the boundary. we are as usual hobbled by our very
primitive understanding of the gauge theory at strong coupling. however, if we are
willing to trust (36) as an approximate expression for the local entropy in terms of
slowly varying e and j, then we can investigate the possibility of phase mixing.

we will start by analyzing all possible mixed phase states with uniform temperature
and voltage. because of the double-valued nature of the equation of state, (20) of [1],
only two-component states are allowed. such states are extrema of the entropy, and
sometimes even local maxima among the states with uniform temperature and voltage,
but in the end we will argue that they are only saddle points if arbitrary mixed phase
states are allowed. the entropy at some of these saddle points is higher than the
entropy of a pure phase state with the same total energy and angular momentum.
a pure phase state with  > 1/3 can evolve smoothly into mixed states, preserving

14

uniform temperature and voltage, and increasing its entropy. a pure phase state with

 < 1/3 cannot increase its entropy smoothly in this way, but if  > 0.325 it can

increase its entropy by jumping discontinuously into a mixed phase state with uniform
temperature and voltage.

for a given temperature t and angular velocity , there are two distinct microcanon-
ical states, labeled by energy density and angular momentum density, which have that
temperature and angular velocity. one of these states, call it (e, j), will lie in the stable
regime where s is subadditive; the other, call it (e, j), will lie in the unstable regime.
our rst goal is to nd (e, j) as a function of (e, j). straightforward calculation leads
to

there are exactly two distinct phases with the same temperature and angular velocity
because (38) has two solutions. the one we have called  is the one less than 1/3, and
 is the one larger than 1/3. we will refer to these as the stable and unstable phases.
if we are thinking in terms of ads space, then the system as a whole is isolated, and
total energy and angular momentum are xed. let us call the average energy density
eav and the average angular momentum density jav. in a state of thermal equilibrium,
we are free to distribute the energy and angular momentum between the two phases
as we please. the state which the system prefers is the one with maximum entropy.

15

first we will nd all the extrema of the entropy function over the domain of two-
components phases with uniform temperature and voltage; then we will see whether
they are maxima, minima, or saddle points.

if a fraction  of the spatial volume is lled by the unstable phase, and the remaining

fraction 1   is lled by the stable phase, then subject to the constraints

eav = e + (1  )e
jav = j + (1  )j

we need to extremize the average entropy,

sav = s + (1  )s .

(40)

(41)

using the overall scale invariance of the theory, we deduce that it is equivalent to
extremize

with xed

it is easy to see that av and av are (rather complicated) functions of  and , whose
domains are [0, 1/3] and [0, 1], respectively. we have veried numerically5 that the
contours of constant av can be written as single valued functions,  = av(). thus
the entropy along a given contour is extremized when

  av
 !av

=   av

 !  av

(av/)
(av/)

= 0 .

(44)

in gure 1 we show contours of constant av cut by a dark line indicating the solution
set of (44). if a contour intersects the dark line, then the maximum of the entropy
function along that contour is at the rst intersection with the dark line; otherwise the
maximum is at the lower border  = 0.

fig. 1. the ne lines (both grey and black) are contours of constant av. the grey lines
which are mainly in the upper part of the plot indicate contours with av > 1/3. the black
lines indicate contours with av < 1/3. the dark line cutting across the ne lines is where
the entropy is extremized. the region below the dark line is where entropy along a contour
increases as one moves to larger . if the scale of the plot were ner and there were more
contours shown, one would see that the dark line cuts some of the ne black lines twice. the
lower edge of the frame, where  = 0, represents pure states with  < 1/3. the upper edge
of the frame, where  = 1, represents pure states with  > 1/3. to avoid singularities in
the numerics we have computed the contours in a slightly smaller domain than the frame
indicates.

the immediate conclusion one can draw from gure 1 is that for av > 1/3 the
entropically preferred state, among states with uniform temperature and voltage, is a

mix of the stable and unstable phases, with  > 0.46 and   1 as av  . the
av < 0.322 mixtures are always entropically disfavored: for such av the preferred state
has  = 0. there is a narrow band of values, 0.322 < av < 1/3, where there are two
far-separated competing states: one with  = 0 and one with   0.46. at av  0.325
there is a rst order transition where  jumps from 0 to 0.46. the temperature and
voltage also jump at this transition, as illustrated in gure 2.

fig. 2. the dimensionless ratio s4

av is plotted against  for two values of av on
either side of the phase transition:
in a) we
see that the  = 1/3,  = 1 solid phase wins out entropically; in b) the mixed phase with
  0.075 and   0.46 is entropically favored.

in a) av = 0.324 while in b) av = 0.326.

the surprising fact is that a discontinuous transition to mixed states can happen
before the solid phase state loses subadditivity. in other words, the critical behavior
associated with the boundary of stability is cut o nitely below the critical angular
momentum by phase separation. the  = 1 states are local maxima of the entropy

function as long as av < 1/3; but they are global maxima only for  < 0.325. for
0.325 < av < 1/3 there is an entropy barrier (the dip in the graph in gure 2(b)
between the right endpoint and the global maximum at   0.075) which suggests
that the  = 1 state is still metastable in this region.
if we think of keeping the
angular momentum xed and decreasing the energy, then this state might be described
as supercooled.

our use of numerics in this section was a practical necessity because the forms of
av and av as functions of  and  are very complicated. it is possible to make a
taylor expansion around  = 1/3, but this only encodes the behavior of the functions
near the right edge of the domain in gure 1. the interesting physics happened in the
middle of the (, ) domain. one might try to make an expansion around av = 1/3,
but since av is a dependent variable in all our computations, it would require some
nontrivial inversions. the numerics seem to have revealed an interesting qualitative
feature of the thermodynamics: a rst order phase transition at av  0.325.

further numerics would be necessary to determine which mixed states have an en-
tropy which is locally subadditive on the domain of states with uniform temperature
and voltage. we regard this as of somewhat limited interest because all such states
are unstable against phase separation into states with non-uniform temperature and
voltage. an easy way to see this is the following. consider any mixed phase state in
gure 1. it is composed of a stable component and an unstable component. lets focus
in on the unstable component: as a pure phase it is represented by a point on the upper

18

edge of the frame in gure 1. by owing down along one of the grey contours into a
mixed state, this component can increase its entropy. the temperature and voltage
within the unstable component remain uniform, but they change relative to the stable
component. we wind up with a three-component mixture with non-uniform tempera-
ture and voltage. we could repeat the process indenitely. by denition, states with
non-uniform temperature and voltage are not extrema of the entropy function. nev-
ertheless, they can have higher entropy for given total energy and angular momentum

than any extremal point, at least when av > 0.325.
in [14] it was proposed that in the canonical ensemble, stability persisted up to
  1.26. as a general rule we agree that thermodynamic stability of a system depends
on its environment. however the results of this section indicate that the instability of
spinning d3-branes at  = 1/3 is not easily avoided by changing ensembles. consider
a state with total e and j arranged so that av is just slightly larger than 1/3. the
pure phase state would correspond to where one of the grey lines in gure 1 intersects
the top of the frame. at this point,  = av. this is the sort of state that the authors
of [14] regard as stable in the canonical ensemble (though not in the grand canonical
ensemble). however, the system may increase its entropy continuously by owing
down along one of the grey lines, until it reaches the dark black line, where entropy is a
maximum at least among two-component mixed phase states of the prescribed av. in
other words, the putatively stable state represents only a saddle point of the entropy,

not even a local maximum. this is in contrast with states with 0.325 < av < 1/3,

where a system in a pure phase state can increase its entropy only by making a big
leap, all the way along one of the ne black lines from the bottom of the frame to the
leftmost intersection of the ne black line with the dark black line. in a nutshell, the
pure phase states represented by the bottom of the frame in gure 1 are metastable
against separation into a two-component mixture, but the pure phase states represented
by the top of the frame are not even metastable. these statements are independent of
the environment because we are talking only about shifting energy around within the
world-volume of the d3-branes. the key point is that d3-branes have spatial extent,
so any little bit of it can be regarded as a system in thermal contact with a heat
bath consisting of the rest of the brane. that is what makes the grand canonical
ensemble relevant. with black holes the story is dierent: because there is no spatial
extent, it is doubtful that one can regard one part of the black hole as a heat bath
for another part. if the d3-brane world-volume were compactied on a scale smaller
than the thickness of a domain wall between phases, then of course the situation would
be physically indistinguishable from a black hole, and calculations in the canonical
ensemble might become relevant. the t hooft coupling, g2
y m n, provides us with a
large dimensionless number in the gauge theory, and it could be that the coherence
length is bigger than 1/t by some power of g2
y m n. this is a possibility that could in

19

principle be investigated through the computation of greens functions following the
methods of [4,5].

since we have discussed mixed phases at some length, a comment is in order regarding
the maxwell construction. in a thermodynamic system where the energy function fails
to be convex, the maxwell construction is to take the convex hull of the energy function
as the true energy. the linear part of the convex hull connecting two minima is
regarded as describing a mixture of the two phases those minima represent. this is a
useful construction in many contexts, but it yields a featureless answer in our case: the
convex hull of the energy function e(s, j; n) is just e(s, 0; n). intuitively, this comes
about from phase mixtures which involve very small and absolutely enormous j, and
which are not in thermal equilibrium because they have non-uniform temperature and
voltage. the maxwell construction as we have phrased it applies to the energy function
as a whole, and can miss some interesting local structure.
in the present case, one
feature of the physics emerges from a local analysis that the maxwell construction would
overlook: pure phase states with  < 1/3 are locally stable, but as one approaches
 = 1/3 the stability becomes delicate and the system eventually prefers to separate
into a mixed phase state.

v. field theory analysis

in [1] a eld theory analysis of spinning d3-branes was attempted, using the fact
that transverse angular momentum on the brane amounted to r-charge. in this section
we will extend the analysis from one angular momentum to three. we will also briey
consider the m2-brane and the m5-brane.

the on-shell degrees of freedom in a single d3-branes world-volume theory are
two vector boson states (counting positive and negative helicity separately), six scalar
states, and eight fermion states. the r-charges of these states are specied by vectors
in the weight lattice of so(6). the on-shell degrees of freedom for a single m2-brane
are eight scalar states and eight fermion states, with r-charges specied by weight
vectors of so(8). the on-shell degrees of freedom for a single m5-brane are three
self-dual two-form states, ve scalar states, and eight fermion states, with r-charges
specied by weight vectors of so(5). all these states are tabulated in equation (45):

for p = 2, 3, or 5, let  be a vector which runs over the sixteen p-brane weights
given above, and set s = 1 when the corresponding particle is a boson and s = 1
when it is a fermion. we will calculate in the grand canonical ensemble with volt-
ages 1, 2, . . . , (d1)/2 corresponding to the elements of the cartan subalge-
bra of the r-symmetry group (for instance, in the case of d3-branes, we have 1,
2, and 3 for the three elements of the cartan subalgebra of so(6)). denoting
 = (1, 2, . . . , (d1)/2) where i = i/t , we have in analogy to (26) of [1] an

of only one angular momentum, the integrals diverge for any real nonzero  because
there are charged massless bosons. the integrals in (46) are all special cases of

real  axis of lip+1(e). in [1] it was proposed to dene the integrals using the principle
value prescription, which in this case amounted to replacing the polylogarithms by their
real parts. this prescription together with the identity

for n coincident d3-branes branes in the supergravity limit, the world-volume theory
is strongly interacting. we nevertheless suggest (49) as a rst approximation to the
grand potential of 3 + 1-dimensional n = 4 su(n) gauge theory at high temperature,
where now we have scaled a factor of n 2 out of  as in section ii. the speculation is that
even though the fundamental excitations are strongly interacting, for the purposes of
thermodynamics we can think of o(n 2) quasi-particle excitations which have the same
multiplet structure as the fundamental degrees of freedom. for the m2-brane, agree-
ment with supergravity requires o(n 3/2) quasi-particles, whereas for the m5-brane,
o(n 3) are required. these peculiar scalings are borne out by absorption calculations
[17], but are otherwise poorly understood.

for the rest of this section we will focus on the d3-brane.
thermodynamic stability requires that  be a subadditive function of t and the i.
because of the scaling laws due to conformal invariance, this amounts to being able
to express the i as single-valued functions of the ratios ji/s. it is straightforward to
check that this is possible on the region of  space containing the origin where

(52)

in (52), which generalizes (42) of [1], the index i is summed over in the last two terms,
and k and  are the indices of the 3  3 matrix whose determinant is taken.

the mean eld theory analysis of [1] also generalizes in a simple way. we will omit
some details which do not depend on the number of angular momenta. the basic idea
is that there is some self-eld contribution to the voltage, which we express as

 =  + f (j/t 3) .

(53)

here  is the total voltage,  is the applied voltage, and f (j/t 3) is the self-eld contri-
bution, given in terms of an unknown function f , and in terms of an r-charge density j
obtained by integrating over the thermal occupation factors (using the principle value
prescription) in the presence of the total voltage . for brevity we are suppressing the

22

three-valued indices on i, i, and ji. the permeability  = / is now a 3  3
matrix which can depend on . the simplest extension of [1] is to assume f (x) = x,
which implies that the permeability at zero voltage is  = 2
3 1. that is, the d3-brane re-
sponds diamagnetically to an applied voltage. we will show how this ansatz reproduces
the critical behavior found in supergravity.

mean eld theory leads to a parametric expression for the free energy:

the rst line in (54) uses (46) with  replaced by . the second line is a rephrasing of
(53) using the ansatz f (x) = x. the function g() is the same as appeared in (49).
since g() is analytic, the only way nonanalyticity can arise is through inverting the
relation between  and . nonanalyticity can arise in this context only if the inverse
permeability,

acquires a zero eigenvalue. thus the boundary of stability is determined by det 1 = 0,
which is equivalent to

this complicated expression reduces to |1|  2 when 2 = 3 = 0. it exhibits the
same qualitative behavior as (20), in that the boundary of stability is a generically
a single zero of the left hand side, with the sole exception of all 2
i equal, when the
boundary of stability becomes a double zero. as before, this indicates that generically
only one eigenvalue crosses through 0 at the boundary, but for all angular momenta
equal two eigenvalues vanish at the same time. we obtain the same critical behavior
from the mean eld theory analysis as from the supergravity, and for basically the same
reasons: making the expansions


t 4 = g(c) + g(c)(  c) + 1

  c = (1 + g(c))(  c) + 1

2g(c)(  c)2 + . . .

we see that  = 1/2 for variations of  in the directions in which 1 has a zero
eigenvalue, while  = 0 in the other directions.

vi. euclidean spinning branes

a. spin and thermal boundary conditions

euclidean black brane solutions can be obtained from the minkowskian ones by
sending t  it and j  ij, where the j are the angular momentum parameters
that enter into the solutions of [8]. complexifying them is necessary in order to keep
the dtd parts of the metric real. the consequences for the thermodynamics can all be
reasoned out from the fact that the angular momentum becomes complex. in brief, one
can retain equations (3) through (14) with the replacements yj  iyj and xj  ixj,
but yh  yh with no factor of i. these replacements have a profound eect on the
physics: as we shall now argue, the phase space is |xj| < 1, and points on the boundary
correspond to supersymmetric periodicity conditions in the euclidean path integral.

the new version of the rst equation in (14) is

y3d

h,e = yj

(1  x2

j ) .

(58)

this relation becomes singular when any of the xi reaches 1 in absolute value, so the
phase space is indeed the cube |xi| < 1. the new version of (11) and (13) is

j
t

= 2i

we now want to study the limits of (59) as we approach the boundary of the cube.
consider xing some number of the xj at values nitely far from the horizon and then
letting all the others approach the horizon at the same rate:
for these others, say
xj = sj(1  ) where sj = 1 and   0. for convenience dene sj = 0 for all the xj
whose values are xed in the interior. let the number of xjs which are approaching the
boundary be n. approaching a generic point on the boundary corresponds to n = 1;
n > 1 means one is approaching a point on an edge or a corner of the cube rather than
a face. it is simple to see from (59) that

j
t 

2i
n

sj .

(60)

for example, if we send x1  1 and hold all the other xi xed, then 1/t  2i and
all other j/t  0.

in a euclidean path integral description of the world-volume theory on the brane,
imaginary j/t has the interpretation of a rotation angle in the compact r-symmetry
group which one performs in joining elds at euclidean time te = 1/t onto their
values at te = 0. when all the angular velocities are zero, the usual thermal boundary

24

conditions are in force: periodic bosons and anti-periodic fermions. the rotations
j/t modify these periodicity conditions according to the r-charge of each eld. this
amounts to inserting an element r of the r-symmetry group in the partition function:
instead of computing tr eh we are computing tr reh. if we set 1/t = 2i and
all other j/t = 0, then r = (1)f , where f = 0 for bosons and 1 for fermions. that
is, we recover supersymmetric boundary conditions.

for n > 1, we can judge whether any part of supersymmetry is restored by deter-
mining whether there are any spinors  of so(d  1) which satisfy r = , where
r is the element of the covering group of so(d  1) specied by j/t = 2i/n for
1  j  n. all spinors satisfy this equation for n = 1, because in the covering group
of so(d  1), r = 1.6 using the weight vectors for the spinor representations of
so(d  1), it is straightforward to verify that a fraction (1/2)n1 of supersymmetry
is preserved. the only exception to this rule is n = 4 for the m2-brane, where in fact
1/4 rather than 1/8 of supersymmetry is preserved.

by studying killing spinor equations in the spinning brane supergravity geometries
one should be able to conrm the simple counting of the previous paragraph. this
was essentially done in [18] for the m2-brane. to be more precise, they investigated
the killing spinor equations for bps-saturated r-charged black holes of n = 8 d = 4
gauged supergravity. the found that n = 1, 2, 3 charges break 1/2n of the original
supersymmetry, while a fourth charge does not break any additional supersymmetry.
in view of the footnote, this is in precise agreement with our results for the spinning
m2-brane. and in fact [19,13], the kaluza-klein reduction of spinning m2-branes leads
precisely to large r-charged black holes of the type studied in [18]. in short, in the
bps limit, multiple angular momenta of spinning branes break supersymmetry in the
same way as multiple r-charges break the supersymmetry of large black holes.

the weight vectors listed in (45) can be used to determine the allowed momenta ke
around the euclidean s1. these momenta determine tree-level masses in the dimen-
sionally reduced theory. for n < 4 there is bose-fermi degeneracy in all cases (m2,
d3, and m5). (see also gure 3.) the m2-brane with n = 4 exhibits no bose-fermi
degeneracy. this may be an indication that our description of the world-volume theory
of many m2-branes in terms of excitations with the same so(8) quantum numbers as
for a single m2-brane is too simplistic to capture even the rough outlines of the eld
theory.

6when r = 1, maximal supersymmetry in the boundary theory is recovered. conformal
invariance is not recovered in general. thus maximal supersymmetry amounts to sixteen real
supercharges. in [18], maximal supersymmetry meant thirty-two real supercharges, so for
instance what we call 1/2 supersymmetric they would call 1/4 supersymmetric.

25

in order to further shed light on the nature of supersymmetry restoration in eld
theory and to make comparison with the supergravity results, let us turn to the study
of the thermodynamic quantities.

we obtain j/t = (2i)/n exactly when xi = 1 (i = 1,   , n), but other thermo-
dynamic relations become singular in this limit. so we choose i = ()2i/[n(1  )]
(xi = (1  )) (i = 1, ..., n,   1), and for the sake of simplicity we set other js
to zero. this is still not the most general way one could imagine approaching the
boundary of phase space: for instance, one could set xi = (1 ri) with arbitrary but
xed ri. this does not lead to any more general scaling behavior than what we will
observe, but the coecients in equations (61) through (70) and (74) would change.

first we compute the grand potential for the eld theory obtained from (46) with
the supersymmetric particle content given in (45). the eld theory results in the   0
limit are as follows:

d3 :

m5 :

m2 :







3 3 , 1

it amounts
for a single m5-brane, or d3-brane this eld theory analysis is sound:
simply to counting states in a free eld theory. (it is not even plagued by the divergences
that we used the principle value prescription to solve in section v: those divergences
were for i real, and are completely avoided by pure imaginary i.) for n > 1 our
understanding of the eld theory at nite temperature is limited. the naive approach is
to hope that it has some properties in common with o(n 3) copies [o(n 2) copies] of the
n = 1 theory in the m5- [d3-] brane. this approach is not well motivated physically,
but it does give the correct scalings with n and  as predicted by supergravity. the
eld theory on multiple m2-branes not very well understood. it is based on a particular
infrared limit of the d2-brane gauge theory where so(8) symmetry is thought to be
recovered (see for example [20,21]). for a single brane, a simple hodge dualization of
a vector eld into a scalar eld suces to show this, but for multiple branes there does
not seem to be a simple argument directly from eld theory.

the positive powers of  in (61)-(62) appear because of the bose-fermi degeneracy in
the spectrum of allowed ke. this is substantially the only indicator of supersymmetry
in this free eld theory computation.

let us now compare the eld theory results to those obtained in supergravity. there
the grand potential  is given by (24). in the   0 limit,  has the following scaling
behavior:

comparing the supergravity results (65) through (67) with those the eld theory
analysis ((61) through (63)) reveals that except for rational prefactors the supergravity
and eld theory results are in good qualitative agreement for both d3- and m5-brane, as
expected since a single d3- and m5-brane eld theory analysis is believed to be sound.
on the other hand there is a qualitative discrepancy between the two approaches for the
m2-brane case, again indicating that the eld theory of m2-brane is poorly understood.
most importantly, we see that the energy density e = p scales in all cases with
a positive power of . recall that e is the energy density over and above the energy
density of a bps-saturated brane conguration. by the same argument that zero
energy states in a supersymmetric theory are supersymmetric states, we conclude that
a state with e = 0 preserves at least some of the original supersymmetries of the brane.
we would like to conclude this subsection by commenting on the supergravity anal-
ysis of the spectrum of the theory. this will become relevant in our discussion in the
next subsection of models of connement based on spinning branes. let us concentrate
on a minimally coupled scalar , that is a scalar whose linearized equation of motion
is the laplace equation in the background of the euclidean spinning brane:

(gg) = 0.

with the ansatz  = eikx(r), where x is a world-volume direction, and (for the sake of

our radial variable is x = r

must recall the replacements xj  ixj and yj  iyj. when n equal euclidean angular
momenta becoming large at xed energy (that is, xi  (1  ) for i = 1 . . . , n), the

7in deriving the above equation the full metric of the spinning brane has to be used. we

in [8]. again, the corresponding spinning (d3, m5, m2)-branes are obtained by turning o
one of the two charges of the (d = 7, 6, 9-dimensional) black hole, and lifting the solution to
ten and eleven dimensions, respectively.

mass gap (74) has the same scaling behavior with , but the actual numerical prefactors
in (74) change.) the spectrum of possible q is discrete because one demands that 
is normalizable.
thus mgap  t for n = 1, mgap  t for n = 2, and mgap diverges for n > 2.
the mass gap can also be quantied in terms of the ratios of the angular momentum
densities at the boundary, ji, (i = 1,   , n) and e. it is straightforward to obtain the

some of the observations we have made about the scaling of the mass gap and
about supersymmetry restoration also follow easily from the results of [22,6,10,11].
the connection that does not seem to have been made there is that the eld theory
itself recovers supersymmetry in the limit of small  because of the insertion of an
element of the r-symmetry group into the partition function.

b. models of connement

the usual route to qcd4 [23] is to compactify the m5-brane worldvolume on a
circle twice. the rst time, one uses supersymmetric boundary conditions on a circle
of circumference 2r1, and by the m-iia duality the result is a d4-brane which, like
the m5-brane, is near-extreme. the second compactication is applied to the euclidean
time coordinate of the d4-brane: it has period 1/t , and we impose thermal rather than
supersymmetric boundary conditions. this second compactication is the important
step. the ve-dimensional theory one is starting with on the d4-brane is the euclidean
version of the su(n) gauge theory with maximal supersymmetry which descends from
the ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. the resulting theory

when there is no angular momentum, the fermions are anti-periodic in the euclidean
time used in the d4  qcd4 compactication, so in the four-dimensional lagrangian
they have masses t . it is usually assumed that at large t hooft coupling, the scalars
pick up comparable masses. from supergravity one learns that the mass gap is also of
order t . this is sensible from a eld theory point of view: in the renormalization group
ow of a gauge theory in which the t hooft coupling is large at energies comparable to
the masses of the matter elds, one expects connement at only lower energies. this
is to be contrasted with a gauge theory where the t hooft coupling is weak at energies
comparable to the masses of the lightest matter elds. there we have the standard

temperature: as indicated in gure 3, some of them are on the order of t .

in view of the existence of matter elds comparable to or much lighter than the
scale of connement, it is no surprise that large angular momenta did not suce to
decouple the glueballs charged under the global symmetry group which rotates these
quarks among themselves [6]. the existence of such kaluza-klein cousins has been a
persistent feature of all supergravity models of qcd4, but it need not be regarded as an
artifact of the construction which must disappear in a full string theory treatment. in
any conning gauge theory (including real-world qcd) in which there are fundamental
matter elds with some avor symmetry and with masses comparable to or lighter than
the connement scale, one expects to have avored hadrons as well as avor-neutral
glueballs. it may not be reasonable to hope that a full string theory treatment of these
backgrounds will decouple all matter elds and leave us with pure glue. it seems more
likely that it will leave us with conning glue coupled to light matter.

it makes sense that glueball mass ratios should be roughly the same [11] when one
makes one angular momentum large as when one makes two large in any ratio except
unity. in terms of the xi variables discussed in the section vi a and dened in (12),
an m5-brane with one angular momentum large with the other zero corresponds to
x1  1 while x2 = 0, whereas two large angular momenta with xed ratio corresponds
to x1  1 with x2/x1 = . as long as  6= 1, one is approaching the edge rather than
the corner of the square which represents the phase space of the spinning brane, and
the pattern of tree-level masses shown in gure 3 obtains. glueball mass ratios should
be and are approximately independent of  because the matter elds whose tree-level
masses are small in comparison with the connement scale. when  = 1, the pattern
of tree-level masses is as shown in the n = 2 line of gure 3. we expect that glueball
mass ratios will change at this point because the relevant matter elds have changed
their tree-level masses.9

one diculty with the original proposal of [23] is that the scale of the fth dimension

9the term glueball is somewhat of a misnomer since we are thinking of states which should
involve adjoint matter elds even if they are singlets under the global avor symmetry that
the matter elds carry. the term glueball is in use because of the expectation (unlikely in
our view) that the supergravity models discussed will correspond to pure qcd4.

31

is the same as the scale of connement. thus any process whose energy is high enough
to probe the gauge dynamics non-triviallyin the sense that colored states, not just
an eective theory like soft pions, would be needed to analyze the processwould also
probe the fth dimension. one might therefore ask in what sense one has dened a
four-dimensional gauge theory at any scale. the spinning branes construction is better

in this regard because for n = 1 there is a large range of energies, t  e  t ,

where the theory is four-dimensional and unconned. the decoupling [6] of glueballs
with kaluza-klein momentum in the fth dimension is the tangible evidence that the
length of the fth dimension is much smaller than the inverse qcd scale.

other approaches to connement avoid a fth dimension altogether by using only
d3-branes, either in type 0 theory [24] or with a varying dilaton in type iib theory [25].
these models have their own diculties: in the former the gravity description breaks
down in the ultraviolet, and there is a tachyon whose mass is on the string scale;
while in the latter one seems to need some excited string state to start the dilaton
owing, and asymptotic freedom cannot be achieved. both approaches involve naked
singularities in the bulk. we summarize the taxonomy of holographic approaches to
conning gauge theories in gure 4. the basic features of connement are not expected
to depend on the existence of matter elds or on their masses, provided that the beta
function remains negative. all the gravity models have a string tension which is much
larger than the square of the mass gap. this leads to some behaviors very unlike real
qcd [26], in particular nearly at regge trajectories.

since only one large angular momentum is needed to make the scalings we have dis-
cussed, it should be possible to construct variants of the spinning m5-brane approach
by putting the branes at some spacetime singularity. orbifold backgrounds would be
expected to lead to bifundamental quarks rather than adjoints. there might even be
chiral models analogous to those discussed in [27]. a model with bona-de light fun-
damental quarks could be dicult to construct, since the fundamental representation
is the charge carried by one end of a string ending on a d-brane, and not typically by
an open string with both its ends on the brane.

fig. 4. energies scales in various attempts to nd a supergravity dual to conning gauge
theories. also included for purposes of comparison is a cartoon sketch of real-world qcd. the
quark masses shown are the parameters that enter into the lagrangian: constituent masses.
in the supergravity models, we have used the mass gap to locate qcd.

we have not yet faced up to one outstanding diculty: why for n = 1 is the
connement scale much higher than the tree-level masses of the light matter elds
(t  t )? the most obvious resolution would be for at least some of the light
masses to receive radiative corrections on the order t from diagrams where heavy

33

elds run around loops. if this were to happen, then superconformal invariance would
be broken at a scale on the order of t , and connement would follow at an energy
scale only slightly lower. a simple perturbative calculation makes this seem unlikely,
as we will now explain. scalar mass renormalizations at one loop typically arise from
integrals of the form

where we have used dimensional regularization and the minimal subtraction scheme.
m is the mass of the heavy elds running around the loop. typically, in a theory
with supersymmetry broken by mass splittings for the heavy elds on the order m,
we have m2  (m)f (m)  (m)m log m
 on account of the near-cancellation of
bosonic and fermionic contributions. with mass breakings such as the ones indicated
in gure 3, the cancellation is even better: m2  (m)n f (n )(m) where n is the
degree of supersymmetry restored when m = 0. in particular, m2  4t for n = 1,
where n = 4 supersymmetry is restored in the   0 limit.

despite this negative evidence from perturbation theory, we nd it plausible that
the heavy elds should play a role in setting the scale of supersymmetry breaking at
t . the strong coupling gauge dynamics may be involved in an essential way. in
view of the fact that this scale is the geometry mean of the the tree-level masses of the
light and heavy elds, we still hope to nd some simple eld theory explanation.

to summarize our discussion: in no sense should spinning m5-brane solutions with
a large angular momentum be regarded as the analog of improved lattice actions for
pure qcd4. the fermions tree level masses are not all far above the connement scale.
in fact, some of them are far smaller than this scale. we do not understand the eld
theory mechanism that sets the scale of supersymmetry breaking and connement at
o(t ) for the case of one large angular momentum. however, if we take this scaling
as a given, we do understand why glueball mass ratios should be universal for two large
unequal angular momenta and somewhat dierent when they are equal: it is because
the pattern of supersymmetry breaking is universal in the rst case, but dierent in
the second.
it would be delightful if the near-restoration of supersymmetry could
be exploited to make more denite predictions about the conning dynamics than is
possible for pure qcd4.

the d3-brane with periodic euclidean time has been proposed as a model for pure
qcd3 [23]. without angular momentum, the bare three-dimensional fermion masses
and also the mass gap are on the order of t . with n equal large euclidean angular
momentum, the light fermion masses are mbare  t , whereas the mass gap is mgap 
1 n
2 t . again it is not easy to see what in eld theory sets this connement scale. the
n = 3 case is particularly surprising: mgap  t /, much larger than the energy scale

34

set by the compactication. universality of glueball mass ratios can be understood in
a similar way to the four-dimensional case, but we regard it as a more pressing problem
to understand the overall scaling of the mass gap from a eld theory perspective.

the supergravity analysis of the previous subsection applies to euclidean spinning
m2-branes as well. however, in view of the poor understanding of the large n eld
theory we refrain from drawing any further comparisons.

vii. conclusion

the purpose of this paper was to provide a comprehensive study of the thermo-
dynamics of spinning d3-, m5-, and m2-branes. our results address the following
aspects:

 thermodynamic stability and critical behavior

we derived general stability constraints for near-extreme d3-, m5- and m2-
branes, all with the maximum number of independent spins. the region where the
entropy is subadditive as a function of both the energy and the angular momenta
is strictly smaller than the region where the specic heat is positive. to illustrate
one of the possible instabilities that develops when the entropy is not subaddi-
tive, we studied states where the angular momentum is unevenly distributed over
the world volume, and found them to be entropically preferred over the uniform
distribution despite the fact that they are not themselves stable congurations.

 field theory

we generalized the eld theory model of [1] to the case of multiple r-charges;
the dynamics is proposed to be described eectively by a collection of weakly
interacting massless quasi-particles whose r-charges and spins are those of the
abelian theory on a single brane. if one assumes in a addition that there is a
nonzero permeability for applied voltages dual to the various r-charges, then
this model reproduces the critical behavior of the supergravity analysis.

 euclidean spinning branes

euclidean branes with at least one angular momentum density which is large
compared to the energy density restore some fraction of supersymmetry. we
showed how this supersymmetry restoration arises in the eld theory: an element
of the r-symmetry group is inserted in the partition function, which for one large
spin approaches (1)f . the spectrum is nearly supersymmetric, with the bose-
fermi degeneracy broken by m  t , where  is a dimensionless parameter
that goes to zero in the limit of large angular momentum. the supergravity

35

analysis reveals that connement occurs on a scale mgap  t 1n/2 when n
equal euclidean angular momenta are made large. we have explained how this
picture elucidates some of the results of previous papers [6,11]. we have left
open the problem of identifying the eld theory mechanism that sets the scale of
supersymmetry breaking.
