abstract

we discuss the dynamics and thermodynamics of particle and d-brane probes
moving in non-extremal black hole/brane backgrounds. when a probe falls from
asymptotic innity to the horizon, it transforms its potential energy into heat,
t ds, which is absorbed by the black hole in a way consistent with the rst law
of thermodynamics. we show that the same remains true in the near-horizon
limit, for bps probes only, with the bps probe moving from ads innity to
the horizon. this is a quantitative indication that the brane-probe reaching the
horizon corresponds to thermalization in gauge theory.
it is shown that this
relation provides a way to reliably compute the entropy away from the extremal
limit (towards the schwarzschild limit).

1 introduction and conclusions

the black d-brane solutions of type ii supergravity [1] and their near-horizon geometry [2]
are the central elements of cft/anti-desitter (ads) correspondence [3, 4, 5]. in particular,
the (3+1)-dimensional world-volume of n coinciding, extremal d3-branes is the arena of
n =4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills (sym) theory which in the large n limit, according
to the maldacena conjecture [3], is linked to type iib superstrings propagating on (the near-
horizon) ads5  s5 background geometry. recently, there has been an interesting proposal
[6] linking the thermodynamics of large n, n =4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills theory
with the thermodynamics of schwarzschild black holes embedded in the ads space [7].
the classical geometry of black holes with hawking temperature t encodes the magnetic
connement, mass gap and other qualitative features of large n gauge theory heated up to
the same temperature. at the computational level, the quantity that has been discussed
to the largest extent [8, 6, 9] is the bekenstein-hawking entropy which, in the near-horizon
limit, should be related to the entropy of yang-mills gas at n   and large t hooft
coupling g2

ymn.

the sym/ads correspondence and its thermal black hole generalizations emerge in a
particular limit of n d-branes coinciding at one point in the transverse space; this corre-
sponds to a conformal point in the sym moduli space, with zero vacuum expectation values
(vevs) of all scalar elds. before taking the near-horizon limit one could also consider some
other congurations, obtained for instance by placing a number of d-branes in the bulk of
ads; this corresponds to switching on some scalar vevs on the higgs branch of the gauge
theory. in this work, we consider the case of a single d-brane probe in the background of a
near-extremal black hole with a large number of coinciding d-branes. we consider a probe
moving from asymptotic innity towards the black hole horizon. as the probe moves through
the horizon, the black hole receives the quantity of heat that is determined by the rst law
of thermodynamics. the corresponding change in black hole entropy is consistent with ther-
modynamical identities. hence from the thermodynamical point of view, the d-brane gas
is physically located at the black hole horizon.

we can then consider a similar process in the near-horizon limit description. that is,
a probe brane is falling from the boundary of the appropriate space (ads5 for d3-branes)
rather than from spatial innity, to the horizon. we nd again, for bps probes, that the
potential energy released is equal to the heat, t ds, absorbed by the black hole. thus,
this process can be used to calculate the entropy of gauge theory in an alternative way by
integrating back the potential energy. moreover, this process has now an interpretation in
terms of the spontaneously broken su(n + 1)  su(n)  u(1) gauge theory. at t = 0,
any higgs expectation value is stable, since it is a modulus protected by supersymmetry.
once t > 0, supersymmetry is broken, and the higgs acquires a potential with an absolute
minimum at zero expectation value. starting with the theory at the top of the potential
(very large expectation value) the higgs will start rolling down. the higgs eld reaching
an expectation value of the order of the electric mass corresponds in supergravity to the
probe reaching the horizon. at this point, the energy stored in the higgs eld is thermalized
and equal to the overall heat received by the thermal yang-mills system. this makes more
precise a similar picture described in [10]. from the supergravity point of view the brane
continues to move, crossing the horizon. it is not obvious what this motion corresponds to

1

in gauge theory (but see [10] for a proposal).

we consider also the eects of higher order  corrections to the probe action. such
corrections have been partially computed for the appropriate backgrounds directly in the
near-horizon limit [11]. we argue that that although there are  corrections to the d-brane
world-volume action, they do not inuence the calculation of the heat in our argument.

in all of the examples analyzed here, the probe method can be viewed as an independent
method of measuring the entropy by integrating the heat, t ds. in particular, it provides a
rst order partial dierential equation for the entropy in terms of mass m and charge q. -
corrections do not modify the leading equation. the only source of stringy corrections to the
entropy equation comes from bulk -corrections to the rr gauge potential at the horizon.
this equation is important since it can be used in conjunction with entropy calculations,
done near the limit where supersymmetry is restored (and thus the calculation is reliable) and
then extrapolated to the schwarzschild region where supersymmetry is completely broken
and calculations are dicult to control.

this talk is based on results obtained in collaboration with constantin bachas [12]. we
will rst describe in detail the case of reissner-nordstrom black holes in four dimensions
and their near-horizon limit. then we will describe arbitrary black dp-branes and nally
focus on the near-horizon limit of d3-branes.

2 reissner-nordstrom black holes

in order to see how probes can be used to study black hole thermodynamics, it is instructive
to consider rst the case of a point particle propagating in the background geometry of a
charged black hole. the reissner-nordstrom (rn) metric for a charged black hole with
adm mass m and electric charge q reads

the free energy and grand canonical potential can also be obtained by the standard ther-
modynamic expressions, f  m  t s and a  m  t s  q.

consider next the process in which a probe particle with mass m and electric charge q
falls inside the black hole. the black hole plus particle form an isolated system, with total
mass m + m and total charge q + q, which will eventually reach thermal equilibrium. the
entropy will therefore change by an amount

using the explicit form of the chemical potential, derived from the equation of state, we

(2.5)

this equation admits a simple interpretation as the heat released by the probe particle while
falling inside the black hole. the action for such a particle indeed reads

 = mz dqg x x + qz d a x .

in the static gauge, t =  , it takes the form

 = z dt v (r) + velocity terms

notice that the potential includes the self-energy m of the probe, and is constant in the
extremal limit for both source (m = q/lp) and probe (m = q/lp), consistently with the
absence of a static force in this case. now as the particle moves from spatial innity to the
outer horizon, the dierence in potential energy, v = v ()v (r+), is converted to kinetic
energy and then eventually dissipated as heat. this is precisely the content of eq. (2.5).

the argument can also be run backwards. starting from the static potential eq. (2.8),
and assuming that the potential energy of the probe is converted to heat at the outer horizon,
leads to eq. (2.5). comparing with eq. (2.4) then gives

this partial dierential equation can be integrated for the equation of state s(m, q), pro-
vided we know already the answer on some (initial) curve in the (m, q) plane, such as for
schwarzschild black holes q = 0 or extremal black holes, m = q/lp. notice that even
though the thermodynamic properties of a schwarzschild black hole are in an essential way
quantum (h enters in the expressions for both temperature and entropy), the extension to
charged black holes follows from the simple classical argument outlined here. such a dier-
ential equation may turn out to be practically important. several thermodynamic properties

3

seem to be more easily computable on or close to the extremal limit. there, supersymmetry
is of help as evidenced by recent d-brane/black hole calculations [13]. being able to cal-
culate at the extremal boundary of the (m, q) plane, one can use (2.9) to extrapolate the
calculation to the whole plane, most importantly in the region q = 0 where supersymmetry
is completely broken. it should be noted though that imposing a boundary condition at the
extremal boundary m = q maybe problematic since in most cases the partial derivatives
diverge there (t = 0). this is the case here as well as for the dp-branes with p < 5. we
could however impose boundary conditions on a line just outside the extremal boundary (at
near-extremality) where computations are still reliable. this point is conceptually important
and needs further investigation.

the reader may of course object that these considerations depend on our choice of a
minimal probe action. quantum gravity eects or stringy eects (controlled respectively by
lp and ls) can give rise to curvature terms and/or non-minimal electromagnetic couplings,
which would modify the potential (2.8). nevertheless, assuming thermodynamic equilibrium,
the relation

t s = v ()  v (r+) = m  qa0(r+)

(2.10)

continues, as we will now argue, to be valid. this is of course consistent with the fact that
for a neutral particle t s = m is simply the rst law of thermodynamics.

to see why the potential dierence is always given by eq.(2.10), consider possible correc-

tions to the action  of the particle. these must be of the form

 = z ds f (r, f, x) ,

(2.11)

with ds  dq x x the invariant proper time element, and f a scalar made out of the
electromagnetic eld strength, the riemann tensor, the probe velocity, and covariant deriva-
f are not allowed, because gauge
tives thereof. note that corrections of the form r dxa
invariance forces the scalar function f to be a constant.2 now in the quasi-static limit
x = (, 0   0), the invariant element ds tends to dt at spatial innity, and vanishes at
the horizon, when expressed in terms of the asymptotic time. the scalar f on the other
hand must vanish at spatial innity where both f and r go to zero. thus, provided f
stays smooth at the event horizon, these higher-order terms will not contribute to the static
potential either at r = r+ or at r = , as advertised.

to show that f cannot indeed diverge at the horizon, note rst that this is automatic
for a scalar function of the background elds, since the horizon singularity is a coordinate
artifact. suppose next that f is the pull back on the world-line of a space-time tensor

f = t1n

(2.12)

with t a function of f , r and their covariant derivatives. near the horizon ( dt
ds )2 = g00
diverges. nevertheless f must remain regular, or else the scalar invariant t1 nt 1 n
could not possibly be nite.

2this does not imply that the electromagnetic coupling must be minimal, since (2.11) may depend non-

trivially on the eld strength.

4

the only remaining possibility is that f depends on extrinsic invariants, or on other
higher-derivative terms of the coordinate functions. they are constructed by using the
covariant accelerations 
1 = x. for n = 2,
this is the acceleration

n. for n = 1, this is the usual four-velocity, 


2 = x 
and so on. notice that 
n are tensors both of the target space dieomorphisms as well as
world-line reparametrizations. the piece of the acceleration that contributes to the potential
is

this in principle can give singular contributions on the horizons via invariants of the form
g
n. we can show however that in the usual on-shell perturbative derivation of the
higher  corrections such invariants cannot appear. the reason is that the rst non-trivial
correction is computed by matching on-shell some scattering amplitude involving the particle
with a combination of higher velocity or acceleration terms. however, on-shell 
 x.
thus, the 2 is redundant and does not appear on-shell in the rst correction terms. conse-
quently the corrected action involves only velocities, and the corrected equations will equate
2 to velocities again. thus, to any nite order of perturbation theory, we do not have
the dangerous acceleration terms. this is supported by a recent calculation of (part of) the
o(2) terms for d0-branes [11].

the upshot of the previous argument is that the right-hand side of eq. (2.10) is universal,
and hence so is the dierential equation (2.9) which one can integrate for the equation of
state. one immediate corollary, assuming the entropy stays smooth in the extremal limit

2  f 

where t = 0, is that a0(r+)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)extremal

= 1/lp always.

there is, to be sure, still a lot of room for string or quantum-gravity corrections to the
thermodynamic functions. both the chemical potential, a0(r+), away from extremality, and
the equation of state for, say, neutral holes s(m, 0), are expected in general to receive such
corrections. it is also conceivable that, like nite-size eects, string and/or quantum gravity
corrections invalidate our thermodynamic treatment of the problem.

3 near-extremal near-horizon limit

to discard quantum gravity eects we will now assume that lp is vanishingly small compared
to all other length scales in the problem. we will furthermore take the near-extremal limit,
and concentrate on the near-horizon geometry of the black hole,

in order to analyze this limit, it is convenient to dene the new coordinates

potential

(3.12)

in agreement with the near-extremal expansion of the electrostatic potential at the horizon
 = a0(u0). note that, as with most other thermodynamic quantities, one has to keep the
rst subleading correction in the near-extremal expansion of , in order to nd the leading
temperature dependence.

a heuristic rephrasing of the main message of this section is as follows: a near-extremal
black hole exerts no net force on an extremal probe at long distance. the potential energy,
is thus converted to kinetic energy and eventually released as heat while the probe falls in
the near-horizon geometry. to leading order in the extremality parameter one can therefore
compute the chemical potential by ignoring the physics in the asymptotically-at region.

4 black dp-branes

we consider now the background geometry (in the string frame) of a near-extremal black
hole describing a number of coinciding dp-branes [1]:

carrying a unit charge so that n is equal to the number of d-branes. finally,

by using standard methods of black hole thermodynamics, it is straightforward to deter-

it is easy to check that these quantities satisfy the thermodynamic identitydu = t ds +

we consider now a dp-brane probing the above solution, with zero background values

for all other elds. in this case, the d-brane probe action is

p = tp ez qdet g + tpz c

(4.9)

where we have also set the world-volume f = 0. using the solution above we obtain the
static potential [17]

where c(r)  c012p(r). note that, like in the rn case, the horizon value c(r0) is equal
to the chemical potential . the values of the potential at innity and at the horizon are,
respectively, v () = vptp and v (r0) = .

a dp-brane probe is a bps state with the mass m = vptp and charge n = 1. as
it moves from innity to the horizon, its potential energy changes by e = v (r0)  v (),
and the quantity of heat received by the black hole is again de = e. on the other hand,
the black hole gains mass dm = m = vptp and charge dn = n = 1. this process is
described by the equation

de = v ()  v (r0) = dm  dn = du  dn = t ds

(4.11)

which does indeed hold. as expected, the probe motion, governed by the background eld
action of eq.(4.9), is consistent with black hole thermodynamics and provides a similar
partial equation of state as in the rn case. the argument concerning the absence of 
corrections here is more involved. unlike the case of one-dimensional world-volumes, here

8

the equations of motion do not set the accelerations (second fundamental forms) to be a
function of velocities [11]. at this point we can argue that to order o(2) there are no
corrections using the explicit results of [11]. it turns out that the second fundamental form
enters in such a way that there are no extra corrections again on the horizon. moreover the
appearance of a non-zero ve form is not expected to change the previous statement. here
we must also investigate the higher anomalous cp-odd couplings. the relevant case is that
of d3 branes and the coupling

s = t3

(4)2

48

z a [p1(t )  p1(n )]

(4.12)

where p1 denotes the rst pontriagin class and t ,n stand for the tangent and normal bundles
to the brane respectively it can be shown that this vanishes for diagonal metrics with the
required poincare symmetry. thus, there is no correction to the heat up to order o(2) and
we suspect that this is true to all orders. this would imply again that all corrections come
from the corrected background elds.

5 d3-branes in the near-horizon limit

the case of d3-branes is particularly interesting because the world-volume action of n
coinciding d-branes involves a four-dimensional n =4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills
theory. according to the maldacena conjecture [3], the large n limit of this gauge theory is
related to the near-horizon ads geometry of the extremal (r0 = 0) black d3-brane solution
(4.1). witten [6] has exploited the ads/sym correspondence in order to study the large
n dynamics of non-supersymmetric sym, with n =4 supersymmetries broken by non-zero
temperature eects. according to this proposal, the non-extremal solution (4.1) may be
used to study sym at t identied with the hawking temperature (4.7) as long as t  1/l,
so that the metric remains near-extremal (r0  l). in the maldacena limit,   l2
s  0 at
u  r/ and t xed, the solution (4.1) describes an ads-schwarzschild black hole [7]:

(5.3)

as in the near-horizon limit of the rn black-hole, here also the gauge eld diverges at the
boundary of ads5, u  .

a d3-brane probe in the bulk of the ads space corresponding to n background d3-
branes can be thought of as a realization of su(n + 1) gauge theory in the su(n)  u(1)

symmetric higgs phase. in the following, we examine some aspects of the probe dynamics
and thermodynamics in the near-horizon limit, in order to show that it is well-dened and
it leads to sensible results also in the higgs phase. to that end, we will use the following
expansions in the string length scale ls:

and has a smooth limit as ls  0. since the probe is bps, v int() = 0 as in the rn case.
the thermodynamic argument is still valid. we let the probe fall until it reaches the

horizon. the heat supplied by the black hole to the probe is

de = v ()  v (u0) = v3t3  v (u0) = m  n =

where n = 1. on the other hand, taking the limit of the equations of the previous
section we obtain that the black hole cools down by dt = t /(2n) which is sucient to
prove directly that de = t ds, with the entropy given by eq.(5.5). we thus nd as before
consistent thermodynamics, when we allow the probe brane to move from the boundary
of ads space to the horizon. this (gravitational) equality corresponds to the qualitative
expectation that an ultraviolet uctuation in n=4 sym spreads until it reaches the size of
the thermal wavelength and thus thermalizes [10].

5we disagree with the potential obtained in the near-horizon limit in [18].
