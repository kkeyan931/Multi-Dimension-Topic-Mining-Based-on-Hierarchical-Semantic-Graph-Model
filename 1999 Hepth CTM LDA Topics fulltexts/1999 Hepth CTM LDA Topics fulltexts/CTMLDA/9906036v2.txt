we show that two-dimensional sigma models are related to certain perturbed conformal eld theories.
when the elds in the sigma model take values in a space g/h for a group g and a maximal
subgroup h, we argue that the corresponding conformal eld theory is the k   limit of the coset
model (g/h)k, and the perturbation is related to the currents of g. non-perturbative instanton
contributions to the sigma model free energy are perturbative when k is nite. we use this mapping
to nd the free energy for the o(n) (= o(n)/o(n1)) sigma model at non-zero temperature. it
also results in a new approach to the cp n model.

sigma models are used frequently in particle physics
and condensed-matter physics to describe goldstone ex-
citations and their interactions. when a eld transform-
ing under some symmetry group g has an expectation
value invariant under some subgroup h, the low-energy
modes of the eld take values in the manifold g/h. the
g/h sigma model is the eld theory describing these
low-energy modes. even in two dimensions, where quan-
tum eects restore the original symmetry group g and
the low-energy excitations are massive, sigma models are
very useful. two-dimensional sigma models have been
the subject of a huge amount of study because they can
be interesting toy models for gauge theories, because they
often arise in experimentally-realizable condensed-matter
systems, because this is the highest dimension in which
they are naively renormalizable, and because of the pow-
erful theoretical methods applicable.

one of the great breakthroughs in two-dimensional
eld theory was the realization that many known mod-
els (and even more previously-unknown theories) could
be written as perturbed conformal eld theories [1]. one
starts with the model at its critical point, which is de-
scribed by a conformal eld theory. in many conformal
eld theories, all the relevant operators are known. one
can thus dene a massive eld theory by adding some
relevant operator to the action. this denes the theory
to all orders in perturbation theory, even if the action of
the conformal eld theory is not known. not any such
model is integrable (most are not) but if it is, one can
apply a variety of techniques to nd for example the ex-
act s matrix and the free energy. literally dozens of
innite hierarchies of models have been solved over the
last decade, the most famous single model being the ising
eld theory at t = tc in a magnetic eld [1].

sigma models have stood somewhat apart from this
line of development. some exact s matrices (for example,
in the o(n) model [2] and the principal chiral model
[3]) have been known for quite some time. the energy in
a magnetic eld at zero temperature in these models can
be computed [4,5], but further progress has been slow.

usually one computes nite-temperature properties in an
integrable model using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz,
but often it is not known how to categorize the solutions
of the bethe ansatz equations, a necessary step for the
thermodynamics. there are a few cases where the com-
putation is possible: the o(3) model and its sausage
deformation [6,7], the o(4) model (equivalent to the
su (2) principal chiral model) [8] and the supersymmet-
ric cp n models [9]. all these models have an intriguing
similarity: they can all be expressed as limits of certain
perturbed conformal eld theories [10,79]. the purpose
of this paper is to explain the general principle behind
these results, and to extend it further.

we will make a general conjecture that these g/h
sigma models are equivalent to the k   limit of a
particular perturbation of the coset conformal eld the-
ory (g/h)k. the utility of this result is threefold. first
of all, it uncovers a nice general structure of g/h sigma
models. moreover, it makes it possible to use the power-
ful methods of perturbed rational conformal eld theory
on sigma models. finally, a great deal is known about
integrable perturbed conformal eld theory (much more
than in sigma models), and therefore these results can be
applied to sigma models. for example, technical compli-
cations had prevented the computation of the free energy
of the o(n) sigma models directly. we will show how
this construction enables this computation for any n.

one of the interesting consequences of this reformu-
lation is that non-perturbative instanton contributions
to the free energy are perturbative when k is nite [7].
for example, in the appropriate perturbation of the coset
models (o(3)/o(2))k, there is a contribution to the free
energy at order k times any integer. when one takes
k   to obtain the o(3) sigma model, this contribu-
tion turns into the instanton contribution, which is not
polynomial in the perturbing parameter. this remains
true even when a theta term is present. for example, this
yields the result that the su (n )/so(n ) sigma models
are integrable when  = , and they ow to the su (n )1
conformal eld theory [11].

we study symmetric spaces g/h, where g and h are
lie groups, and h is a maximal subgroup of g. the
g/h sigma model has action

s =z d2z gij(x)x i(z, z)x j(z, z),

(1)

where z and z are coordinates for two-dimensional space-
time, and x i and gij(x) are the coordinates and met-
ric for the manifold g/h. symmetric spaces have non-
vanishing curvature, so (1) denes an asymptotically-free
massive eld theory. when g = h  h and h is a sim-
ple lie group diagonally embedded in g, the resulting
sigma model is called the principal chiral model. an-
other example is the o(n) model, where g = o(n)
and h = o(n  1). this space is an n  1 dimensional
sphere: o(n) is the rotational symmetry of the sphere,
while o(n1) is the subgroup leaving a given point xed.
a coset conformal eld theory utilizes the ane kac-

moody algebra gk dened by the operator product

j a(z)j b(w) =

k

(z  w)2 +

f abcj c (w)

z  w

+ . . . ,

(2)

where the f abc are the structure constants of the ordi-
nary lie algebra for g and k is called the level; k is a pos-
itive integer for a compact lie group. a conformal eld
theory with current algebra gk is called a wess-zumino-
witten model, and is equivalent to the principal chiral
model for g plus an extra piece called the wess-zumino
term [12]. the central charge (coecient of the confor-
mal anomaly) of the gk wzw model is k dimg/(k + h),
where f acdf bcd = hab/2. for g = su (n), h = n,
while for g = so(n), h = n2 (for n  4). the pri-
mary elds of the wzw model have scaling dimensions
xj = 2cj/(k + h), where cj is the quadratic casimir
dened by t at a = cj i, with the t a the generators of
the lie algebra of g in the jth representation and i the
identity matrix. all the other scaling elds arise from the
operator product of the j a(z) with the primary elds; it
follows from (2) that j has dimension 1 and all elds
have dimensions xj plus an integer.

given a subgroup h of g, a (g/h)k coset conformal
eld theory is dened from the generators of gk not in
the subalgebra hl (l/k is the index of the embedding of
h into g) [13]. the central charge of this new conformal
eld theory is cg  ch . the energy-momentum tensor
obeys the orthogonal decomposition tg = th + tg/h,
so a eld g (some representation of gk) decomposes
into representations a

h of hl as

g = a a

g/h  a
h .

(3)

the coecients a
g/h are the elds of the coset model
(g/h)k. a consequence of g/h being a symmetric space
is that the generators of g not in h form a real irre-
ducible representation of h [14]. thus when the cur-
rents j a(z) are decomposed into representations of hl,

the resulting elds in the coset model form a real irre-
ducible representation of hl, which we denote as j a, for
a = 1 . . . , (dim g  dim h).

obviously, the g/h sigma model cannot be equivalent
to a coset theory (g/h)k, because the latter is massless
while the former is not. a massive eld theory is dened
by perturbing (g/h)k by a relevant operator. we can
now state our conjecture precisely.

conjecture the sigma model for the symmetric space
g/h is equivalent to the k   limit of the (g/h)k
coset conformal eld theory perturbed by the operator

o 

dim gdim hxa=1

j a(z)j

a

(z).

(4)

because the j a form a real irreducible representation of
hl, their dimension is independent of a.

this perturbed coset has the general properties of a
sigma model. in the ultraviolet limit, the perturbation of
(g/h)k goes away, and its central charge when k   is
dimgdimh. in the ultraviolet limit of the sigma model,
asymptotic freedom means that the manifold g/h be-
comes at (e.g. in the o(n)/o(n1) model, the radius
of the sphere goes to innity). the action (1) reduces
to dimgdimh free bosons, which also have the central
charge dimgdimh. moreover, when j a is decomposed
into representations of hl, the resulting eld a
h has di-
mension going to zero as k  . thus the eld j a
has dimension 1 in this limit, so the perturbation o is
of dimension 2 and so is naively marginal. it is not ex-
actly marginal  this is the phenomenon of dimensional
transmutation common to sigma models.

for principal chiral models, the conjecture is already
known to be true [15], and is reminiscent of an earlier de-
scription in terms of an innite number of fermion avors
[10]. since dimg  dimh = dim h here, the perturba-
tion o of the coset hk  hk/h2k is in the adjoint of
h2k. the usual coset notation for such an operator is
(1, 1; adjoint). this means that the corresponding g
is a descendant of the identity primary eld in the hk
conformal eld theories (i.e. j a operating on the vac-
uum), and the h in its decomposition are in the adjoint
of h2k. such an operator is often called the thermal
operator (because when k = 1 and h = su (2), o is
the thermal operator in the ising model). the particles
in the perturbed coset models are kinks whose exact s
matrices were conjectured in [1517]. for nite k, the
kinks form representations of the quantum-group alge-
bra uq(h) with q =  exp(i/(k + h)). as k  ,
q  1 and the quantum-group algebra reverts to the
ordinary lie algebra of h. for example, for su (4), this
means that particles are in the 4, the 6 and the 4 rep-
resentations, giving 14 particles all together. once an
intertwiner is used to change basis, the s matrices in

2

the k   limit are those conjectured for the h  h/h
sigma models in [3]. the exact free energy for the coset
models was found in [18], using results of [19,20].

in the o(3) sigma model, the elds take values on
the sphere, which is the symmetric space o(3)/o(2) 
su (2)/u (1). the curvature (or equivalently, the radius)
of the sphere determines the mass scale of the model.
in this case, the conjecture above was put forth in [7].
there it was phrased as taking the k   limit of
the zk parafermion theories perturbed by the operator
11+h.c.. parafermions are a generalization of fermions
which instead pick up zk phases when taken around one
another; i(z) and i(z) are the parafermions, where i
runs from 1 to k  1. the zk parafermion models can be
described by the coset su (2)k/u (1), and the operator
j 1 here is indeed the parafermion 1, while j 2 = 
1
[21]. as opposed to the principal chiral models, the par-
ticles here are in the vector representation of o(3). thus
our result provides a natural explanation and generaliza-
tion of the conjecture of [7]. one interesting thing about
this model is that a topological theta term can be added
to the action. putting  =  corresponds to adding the
operator io to the action of the coset model [7]. the
partition function is still real, because only even powers
of the perturbation appear in the expansion.

we now turn to the general o(n) model, which our
conjecture says should be described by a perturbation
of the o(n)k/o(n1)k sigma model. the n1 elds j a
are in the vector representation of o(n1), which has
quadratic casimir (n2)/2 for n > 4. thefore the oper-
ator o is of dimension 2  (n2)/(k + n  3)). to pro-
ceed further, we make use of a level-rank duality which
shows that o(n)k/o(n1)k coset model is equivalent to
o(k)n1  o(k)1/o(k)n [22]. in this dual coset model,
the operator o is (vector,vector; 1). this is precisely
the electric-type perturbation discussed in [23]. there
it is shown that this model remains integrable under this
perturbation, and that it follows from the non-local sym-
metries that the kinks are in the vector representation
of uq(o(n)). (in the thermal perturbation of these coset
models, the particles are in the spinor representations
[17].) if we take k   to reach the sigma model, the
quantum group turns into the ordinary algebra o(n) with
the particles in the vector representation. this agrees
with the classic sigma-model result of [2]. the s matri-
ces must of course be the same.

even though the exact s matrix for these integrable
sigma models has been known for 20 years, the free en-
ergy at non-zero temperature has not been computed.
one usually can calculate the free energy of an integrable
model by using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz [24].
this works by deriving the bethe equations, which are
coupled polynomial equations (of number of particles in
the system). the energy levels are given by particular
sums over the solutions. the bethe equations are not

solvable in closed form, but if one can nd all the dier-
ent types of solutions (called strings) in the continuum
limit, the free energy can be computed by calculating the
densities of each of these dierent types. for an s matrix
with particles in the vector of o(n), the bethe equations
are known [25]. the types of solutions are known for
the more general quantum-group algebra uq(o(n)), de-
scribed in the language of a lattice rsos model [19,20].
the boltzmann weights of the rsos model are precisely
the s matrix of the perturbed o(n)k/o(n1)k coset (up
to an overall function which makes ss = 1; this factor
was worked out in [23]), and the problem of nding the
free energy is closely related (an analogous computation
and references are in [9]). we then can take the k  
limit to obtain the free energy of the sigma model.

we rst discuss n even, where o(n) is simply laced.
the function 0() is dened so that the lling frac-
tion of particles at rapidity  and temperature t is
1/(1 + exp(0())) (the lling fraction is the density of
particles divided by the density of states). equivalently,
t 0() is the energy it takes to create a particle of en-
ergy m cosh  over the fermi sea; the mass m of a parti-
cle is related to the sigma model coupling (the radius of
the n1 dimensional sphere) in [5]. we also dene a set
of magnon energies (a)
r (), where r = 1 . . . k  1 and
a = 1 . . . n/2. the functionals a(a)

r () are dened as



a(a)

n  2

d
2

ln(1+ea

2 cosh[(n  2)(  )/2]

r () z 
while ea(a)
the matrix eirs = r,s1 + r,s+1. finally, with mab(x) =

r () is dened with   . the matrix iab is
2  cab, where cab is the cartan matrix for o(n), while

2 cosh(x/(n  2))ab  iab and m1 its matrix inverse,
the function fa() is dened as the fourier transform

r ( ))

fa() =z 



dx
2

eix(m1)1a(x)

then an extension of the results of [19] yields the follow-
ing integral equations, valid for even n > 4 and k  2:

dfa(  ) ln(1 + e(a)

1 ( ))

0() =

(5)

the free energy per unit length is then given by

f = 

mt

2 z 



d cosh  ln(1 + e0()).

(6)

when n is odd so o(n) is not simply laced, the struc-
ture is more complicated. nevertheless, the conjecture
still is valid and the free energy follows from [20]. the

3

function mab is given by their equation (b.10), while the
second equation in (5) is replaced by their (b.4a) with
its left-hand side replaced by a0r,1a,1 (note also that
the range of r depends on the value of (a)).

these equations are straightforward to solve numeri-
cally. the free energy as m  0 gives the correct value,
proportional to the central charge c = k(n  1)(2k + n 
4)/(2(k + n  3)(k + n  2)) of the o(n)k/o(n1)k con-
formal eld theory. the equations remain well-dened
as k  ; an innite number of magnons is a generic
characteristic of models with lie algebra symmetries (as
opposed to quantum-group structure).

we think the above arguments are convincing for in-
tegrable models, but other cases remain mostly unex-
plored. the cp n1 sigma model, which has g = su (n)
and h = su (n1)  u (1), is particularly interesting.
this is believed to be not integrable except for n=2,
where su (2)/u (1)  o(3)/o(2). the (not conclusive)
evidence against integrability is that no local conserved
charges have been found [26], and that anomalies appear
in the non-local conservation laws [27]. our conjecture
may provide a useful way of exploring the models proper-
ties. the su (n)k/su (n1)ku (1) coset model is dual to
the w (k) minimal model su (k)n1  su (k)1/su (k)n.
in the latter, the perturbing operator o is denoted
(k, k; 1) + (k, k; 1). for k=2, this model is the 21 per-
turbation of the nth minimal model. both this [1] and
the k=3 case [23] are integrable, but the counting argu-
ment used to prove integrability for k=2, 3 does not yield
a conserved current for k > 3. however, (at least to rst
order in perturbation theory), all these models have a
nonlocal symmetry generated by the chiral part of the
w (k)

1 (1, 1; adjoint) operator (15 for k = 2).
there are a number of prospective uses of our conjec-
ture in the cp n1 model. one could use the truncated
conformal scaling approach [28] to nd the low-lying en-
ergy levels of the theory; a signal of integrability is that
the levels can cross as the strength of the perturbation is
varied. also, the conjecture implies the existence of non-
local conserved quantities in the sigma model, by taking
the k   limit of those in the perturbed coset model.
these do not seem to be anomalous like the ones dis-
cussed in [27], so even if cp n1 is not integrable, it still
should have an interesting symmetry structure.

we have found a broadly-applicable and useful feature
of g/h sigma models, a feature which we have conjec-
tured to be completely general. in fact, we believe it is
even true when g/h is not a symmetric space; the com-
plication is that there are multiple coupling constants in
the sigma model, and multiple perturbations of the coset
model. moreover, simple extensions of this conjecture
allow for topological or wess-zumino terms in the sigma
model action, and also to supersymmetric sigma models.
