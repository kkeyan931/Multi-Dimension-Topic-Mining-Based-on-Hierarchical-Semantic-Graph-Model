abstract

the formula known as the non-abelian stokes theorem is given for general semi-
simple compact gauge groups. the formula involves a path integral over a group
space, and is applicable to wilson loop variables irrespective of the topology of loops.

some simple expressions analogous to the t hooft tensor of a magnetic monopole are
given for the 2-form concerned. the special property of the case of the fundamental

representation of the group su(n) is pointed out.

introduction

the non-abelian stokes theorem (nast) equates the wilson loop variable

w [] = tr(cid:16)p eir 1

0

a(x(t)) dx (t)

dt dt(cid:17)

to a quantity described by the surface integral of the eld strength

f(x) = a(x)  a(x)  i[a(x), a(x)].

(1.1)

(1.2)

in (11),  is a closed loop parametrized by t ( = {x(t) | 0  t  1, x(0) = x(1)}),  is a
gauge coupling constant and a(x) is a non-abelian gauge eld. roughly speaking, there
have been proposed two kinds of nast. the rst kind of nast 1) - 13) has a rather long
history and involves a duplicate path ordering. when the loop  is trivial, i.e. unknotted

and unlinked, it is described as

w [] = tr(cid:16)pteir 1

0

dtr 1

0

dsf (x(s,t)) x(s,t)

s

f(x) = w(x)f(x)w1(x),

x (s,t)

t (cid:17),

(1.3)
(1.4)

where pt denotes the t-ordering, w(x) is a unitary matrix depending on a path from x(0, 0)
to x(s, t) and the boundary s of the simply connected surface s = {x(s, t) | 0  s, t  1}
is assumed to coincide with . the point x(0, 0) in (13) should be identical with the point
x(0) = x(1) in (11). since the matrix w(x) contains the ordering in the parameter s, the

r.h.s. of (13) involves a duplicate path ordering. the consistency of the formula (13) is
guaranteed 10) by the bianchi identity

[d, f] + [d, f] + [d, f] = 0.

(1.5)

the generalization of (13) to the cases that the loop  is topologically nontrivial, i.e. knotted
and/or linked was attained recently. 11)

on the other hand, in the second kind of nast, the path ordering is replaced with a
path integral in a group manifold. 14) - 20) in the formulation of diakonov and petrov, it takes
the form 14)

(1.6)

(1.7)

(1.8)

w [] = z [dg]eir

(x),

where (x) is the 1-form dened by

(x) = h|ag1

 (x)|idx,
i


ag1

 (x) = g1(x)a(x)g(x) +

g1(x)g(x).

2

in (17) and (18), g(x) is a unitary representation of the gauge group, |i is the highest
weight state in the representation and satises the normalization condition h|i = 1. it
can be shown that there exists a group-invariant measure dg satisfying the condition 21)

z dg g|ih|g1 = 1.

the integral measure [dg] in (16) is given by

[dg] = yx

dg(x).

(1.9)

(1.10)

it is known that the integral over the group g can be replaced by the integral over the

quotient group g/h, where h is the stability group of |i dened by

h|i = ei(h)|i, (h)  r, h  h.

with the aid of the conventional stokes theorem

z

(x) = zs

d(x),

s = ,

(1.11)

(1.12)

the exponent of the integrand on the r.h.s. of (16) can be expressed as a surface integral of a

function containing the eld strength. for the fundamental representation of the gauge group
su(2), diakonov and petrov 17) observed that the 2-form d(x) in (112) can be described
by a gauge invariant tensor eld which has a similar structure to the t hooft tensor. 22) the
latter tensor eld is given by

t(x) =

3xa=1

f a

(x)ba(x) 

1


3xa,b,c=1

abcba(x)(db(x))b(db(x))c,

(1.13)

where ba(x) (a = 1, 2, 3) is a unit isovector eld constructed by the so(3) higgs eld a(x)
by ba(x) = a(x)/|(x)|. it is well known that the electromagnetic eld produced by the
so(3) magnetic monopole is given by t(x). if we replace ba(x) in (113) by

na(x) =

tr(g1(x) ag(x) 3)

(1.14)

1
2

with  a (a = 1, 2, 3) being pauli matrices, we obtain the tensor eld appearing in d(x).

the purpose of this paper is to pursue the line of thought of the second kind of nast
14), 17) further. we discuss the case of general semi-simple compact gauge groups at rst.
we shall nd some interesting expressions for the integrand d(x) of the above mentioned

surface integral. we shall also nd that there exists a simpler expression for d(x) if we
restrict ourselves to a fundamental representation of su(n). all the above expressions for

d(x) involve natural generalizations of the t hooft tensor.

3

this paper is organized as follows. in 2, we obtain some expressions for the 2-form d(x)
which can be used for general semi-simple compact gauge groups. in 3, we discuss the case

of the fundamental representation of su(n) and clarify its special property. 4 is devoted
to summary and discussions.

2. some expressions for the integrand of the surface integral

2.1. preliminaries

we consider a xed d-dimensional representation of a semi-simple compact lie group
g. the representations {t a | a = 1, 2,    , k} = {hi, e | i = 1, 2,    , l, :root of g} of the
generators of g are assumed to satisfy

[hi, hj] = 0,

i, j = 1, 2,    , l,

[hi, e] = ie,

i = 1, 2,    , l,

tr(t at b) = ab,

a, b = 1, 2,    , k,

(2.1)

where  = (1, 2,    , l)  rl is a root vector and  is a positive constant. thus, we are
working in a d-dimensional representation of a group of dimension k and rank l. the basis
vectors |(n)i (n = 1, 2,    , d) of the representation space satisfy

hi|(n)i = i(n)|(n)i,

i = 1, 2,    , l,

h(n)|(m)i = mn,

dxn=1

|(n)ih(n)| = 1,

(2.2)

(2.3)

where (n) = (1(n), 2(n),    , l(n))  rl is a weight vector. we denote the highest
weight of the representation and the highest weight state by  and |i, respectively:

 = (1) = (1, 2,    , l),

|i = |(1)i.

we dene a group theoretic coherent state |gi by

|gi = g|i,

(2.4)
(2.5)

(2.6)

where g is a d-dimensional representation of an element of g. then as discussed by many
authors, the wilson loop variable dened by (11) can be written as (16). 14) - 21), 23) if we
make use of (16) and (112), we are led to the formula

where  is given by

w [] = z [dg]eirs
 = d(x) = d(cid:16)h|ag1

,

 (x)|idx(cid:17).

(2.7)

(2.8)

2.2. a formula for h|k|i

product of the quantity   h = pl

diakonov and petrov 14) argued that the 1-form (x) in (17) is given by the trace of the
 (x) in (18). we begin our discussion
with explicitly deriving their conclusion. it can be shown that, if we dene diagonal matrices
jn (n = 1, 2,    , d) by

i=1 ihi and ag1

|(n)ih(n)| =

(n)  h + jn,

1


they satisfy

then, we have

tr(hijn) = tr(ejn) = 0.

h|k|i = tr(|ih|k)

(2.9)

(2.10)

= tr(cid:16)n 1



  h + j1ok(cid:17)

tr(  hk), k  gd,

(2.11)

=

1


dxn=1

where gd is a d-dimensional representation of the lie algebra of g, i.e. a linear span of his
and es. the formula (211) reproduces the conclusion of diakonov and petrov. we note
that the formula

i(n)|(n)ih(n)|

(2.12)

yields the relations

hi =

dxn=1
dxn=1

i(n)j(n) = ij,

i(n)jn = 0

and the expression

jn =

dxm=1nnm 

1


(n)  (m)o|(m)ih(m)|.

2.3. an abelian-like expression for 

from (28) and (211), we obtain the formula

 =




tr(cid:16)(  h)d(ag1

 (x)dx)(cid:17).

if we dene a vector eld b(x) by

b(x) =

1


tr(cid:16)(  h)(ag1

 (x))(cid:17),

5

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

 becomes as

 = g(x)d

g(x) = b(x)  b(x),

d =

1
2

dx  dx.

(2.17)
(2.18)

(2.19)

we can interpret the factor rs  in (27) as the ux of the eld strength produced by
 (x)  (ag

the potential b(x). it should be noted that the transformation property of b(x) under
ag1

(x) is not simple and that, under the transformation

 )g1(x) = ag1g



(ag1

 )(x)  (ag1

 )g

(x) = agg1



(x)

with

g(x) = exp[i(x)  h],

i(x)  r (i = 1, 2,    , l),

b(x) transforms in the following way:

b(x)  b(x) +

1


(  (x)).

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

2.4. a t hooft tensor-like expression for

 (x) into two terms as in (17). then

we have

i = tr(cid:16)hid(g1(x)a(x)g(x))dx(cid:17),
i = itr(cid:16)hig1(dg)g1dg(cid:17).

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

the 2-form i is called the kirillov-kostant 2-form. it is known 24) that, making use of q(g)
dened by

q(g) = g(x)|ih|g1(x) =

1


g(x)  hg1(x) + g(x)j1g1(x),

(2.27)

the 2-form  can be written as

 = itr(cid:16)q(g)[q(g), q(g)](cid:17)d.

(2.28)

the rst term  of the r.h.s. of (223) can be rewritten as

 = tr(cid:16)q(g)[f(x) + i[a(x), a(x)]  2{a(x), q(g)}](cid:17)d.

6

after some manipulations, it turns out that g(x) in (217) can be expressed as

g(x) = tr(cid:16)q(g){f(x) +

i


[dq(g), dq(g)]}(cid:17),

dq(g) = q(g)  i[a(x), q(g)].

(2.29)

the similarity of g(x) to the t(x) of (111) is obvious. we note that the formulas

and

{q(g)}2 = q(g)

q(g){q(g)}q(g) = 0

(2.30)

(2.31)

were repeatedly utilized in the derivation of (229). we also note that the operator q(g)
appearing in g(x) does not belong to gd of (211) since it has the portion g(x)j1g1(x),
while mi(g) dened by

mi(g) = g(x)hig1(x),

i = 1, 2,    , l,

(2.32)

belongs to gd.

2.5. the third expression for 

in terms of mi(g) introduced in the last subsection, the tensor eld g(x) can be written

as

g(x) =

1


tr(cid:16)(  m ){f(x) + h(x)}(cid:17),

where h(x)  gd is dened by

h(x) =

i


[k(x), k(x)],

k(x) = a(x) + i(g(x))g1(x).

(2.33)

(2.34)

(2.35)

it can be readily seen that k(x) and h(x) transform covariantly under gauge transfor-
mations. in the next section, we consider the special case of the fundamental representation
of su(n). there, we shall nd an expression for g(x) which is also similar to (229) and
(113).

3. the case of the fundamental representation of su (n )

in the previous section, we discussed the path integral formulation of the nast by
making use of group theoretic coherent states. it turned out that the integrand  of the
surface integral, or g(x) in (217), can be expressed by the operator q(g) of (227) in

7

an analogous form to the t hooft tensor t(x), (113), of the so(3) magnetic monopole.
we stress that q(g) is not lie algebra valued because it has the piece g(x)j1g1(x).
in
this section, we show that, in the case of the fundamental representation of su(n), we can
rewrite g(x) in terms of the lie algebra valued quantity m(g) dened by

m(g) =

1


g(x)  hg1(x) =

1


n 1xi=1

imi(g).

by denition, m(g) can be written as

m(g) =

1


n 21xa=1

m a(g)t a,

m a(g) = tr(t am(g))

= h|g1(x)t ag(x)|i

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

where n 2  1 the dimension of the group su(n). the rank of su(n) is equal to n  1 and
hence there are n  1 fundamental representations. the following discussions are valid for

any of them. since the dimension of the fundamental representation of su(n) is n, we are
led to the conclusion that all of the diagonal matrices jn in (29) are given by

jn =

1
n

1, n = 1, 2,    , n,

(3.4)

where 1 is the n  n unit matrix. the above conclusion is deduced from the requirements
tr(hijn) = 0, tr(hi) = 0 (i = 1, 2,    , n  1) and tr(|(n)ih(n)|) = 1. from (227), (31)
and (34), we obtain

q(g) = m(g) +

1
n

1

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)
(3.8)

and hence

q(g) = m(g).

with the help of (210), (229), (35) and (36), we easily nd the formula

g(x) = tr(cid:16)m(g){f(x) +

i


[dm(g), dm(g)]}(cid:17),

dm(g) = m(g)  i[a(x), m(g)].

in terms of the components m a(g) in (32), the tensor eld g(x) is expressed as

g(x) =

n 21xa=1

f a
(x)m a(x) 

1


n 21xa,b,c=1

f abcm a(g)(dm(g))b(dm(g))c,

(3.9)

where f abc is the structure constant of su(n). comparing (39) with (113), we observe
that there exists a complete parallelism between the t hooft tensor t(x) and the g(x)
in the fundamental representation of su(n).

8

at the end of this section, we compare our result with the expression for i in (224)

given by faddeev and niemi: 26)

i = itr(cid:16)mi(g)

n 1xk=1

[mk(g), mk(g)](cid:17)d.

on the other hand, through a similar discussion to the above, we obtain

 = itr(m(g)[m(g), m(g)])d

(3.10)

(3.11)

the fact that (310) and (311) are consistent with the relation  = (pn 1

can be checked in the following way. with the help of the formulas

i=1 ii)/, (224),

mi(g)mj(g) =

1
2

n 1xk=1

dijkmk +

1
2n

ij

n 1xk=1

diik = 0,

with dijk  4tr(hihjhk) which are used in ref. 26), we can rewrite (310) as

i = itr(mi(g)[j, j])d,
j = (g(x))g1(x).

as for the  of (311), we make use of the formula

{m(g)}2 =

n  2

n

m(g) +

n  1

n 2

1,

derived from (230) and (35). then we have

 = itr(m(g)[j, j])d.

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)
(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

recalling the denitions (224) and (31), it is clear that (314) and (317), and hence (310)
and (311), are consistent to each other. it is of course possible to rewrite g(x) of (37) or
(39) in terms of mi(g) instead of m(g). to our opinion, however, the expressions (37) and
(39) are simplest.

4. summary and discussions

we have presented some expressions for the 2-form  appearing in the nast (27).
it turns out that the simple formulas (29) and (210) which lead us to (211) are useful.

we hope that the formulas (218), (229), (233) for the general case and (37) and (39)

9

for the case of the fundamental representation of su(n) are helpful for future discussions
of the wilson loop. the nast (27) can be applied to any closed loop  since only the

conventional stokes theorem, (111), has been used in the derivation. in contrast to abelian
cases, it still contains the gauge potential a(x) through the covariant derivative d. the
formula (27) is, in a sense, of a curious structure: the integral measure [dg] concerns the

loop  = s while the exponent r  concerns the interior s0 of s as well as . if necessary,
we can insert the path integral r [edg]s0 = 1 over the interior s0 with [edg]s0 = qxs0 edg(x),
edg(x) = |h|g(x)|i|2dg(x) into (16) since we obtain r edg(x) = 1, x, from (18). if we
make use of (112) after the insertion, we are led to the formula w [] = r [dg][edg]s0eirs
