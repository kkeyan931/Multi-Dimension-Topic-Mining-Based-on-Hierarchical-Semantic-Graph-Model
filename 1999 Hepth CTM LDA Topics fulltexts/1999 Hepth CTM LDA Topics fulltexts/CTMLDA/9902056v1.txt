abstract

a particularly simple class of nonselfdual solutions are obtained for gauge elds
in schwarzschild and desitter backgrounds. for lorentz signature these have nite
energy and nite action for euclidean signature. in each case one obtains either real
or a pair of complex conjugate solutions. the actions are easily computed for any
dimension d. numerical values are given for d = 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. it is explained why
d = 5 is a very special case. possible continuations and generalizations of the results
obtained are indicated. a particular solution for ads4 background is presented in the
appendix.

1 introduction :

in a previous paper [1], almost twenty years ago, we presented very simple,nonselfdual solu-
tions for gauge elds in schwarzschild and desitter backgrounds in four dimensions. they
were further discussed in refs. 2 and 3. here they are generalized to all dimensions d  4,
with lorentz or euclidean signature and (d  1) spatial dimensions. a solution in anti-
desitter background, restrited to d = 4, is studied in the appendix.

let us briey recapitulate our previous results. the necessary steps for higher dimensions,

as will be seen in the next section, will then be straightforward.

the background metrics are, for d = 4, in standard notations,

where respectively,

and

n = (cid:16)1

the gauge elds, for our static, spherically symmetic ansatz, are given by

(1.4)

finite energy (action) is obtained for lorentz (euclidean) signature, corresponding to

(1.2) and (1.3) respectively, for

k =

r + 2ma
r + 2mb

,

(a = 2.366, b = 4.098)

(1.5)

and

k =

1 + ar2
1 + br2 ,

(a = i1.732, , b = 0.857  i0.742)

(1.6)

the exact values of a and b can be found in ref.1. ( the simple equations determining

such parameters are given in sec.2. )

for (1.2), when evaluating the energy or the action, apart from the standard angular
integration, giving a factor 4, the radial integral is over the domain [2m, ]. for lorentz
signature one obtains a nite energy for this outer region. for euclidean signature time
becomes periodic with a period 8m and the domain [2m, ] for r corresponds (as explained
after (1.14)) to the entire one covered by the kruskal coordinates. in this context one obtains
a nite action for (1.5). this action is less than 82. it is

s = 82(0.959)

(1.7)

this inequality is emphasized for the following reason. selfdual and antiselfdual solutions

can be obtained directly from the spin connections [1]. setting

(1.8)

one obtains the fundamental selfdual and antiselfdual solutions for the upper and the lower
sign respectively. the euclidean action and the topological index are respectively

and

s = 82

p = 1

(1.9)

thus we have a nonselfdual solution with lower action than the (anti)instanton with the
lowest nontrivial index. (see the relevant remarks in sec.4.) note that for m = 0 in (1.5),
k = 1 and hence a = 0 in (1.4). thus the at space limit is trivial.the curved metric is
intrinsically necessary for the existence of such a solution.

for the desitter case the domain of r is the inner region upto the horizon, namely,

for euclidean signature the time period is 2 1
lower sign in (1.6) respectively,

2 . the complex action is, for upper and

h0,  1
2i

(1.10)

s = 82(cid:16)1.755  i4.197(cid:17)

(1.11)

such a complex solution can be considered in the context of a complexied gauge group,
sl(2, c) for our case. see the remaks and the references in [2]. the possible role of complex
saddle points was also discussed in [2].

2

before introducing the ansatz for gaugeelds in higher dimensions (sec.2), let us reca-
pitulate briey some known but directly relevant results concerning the chosen metrics and
the traces of the generators of the gauge group so(d  1).

the schwarzschild metric for d  4 in spherical coordinates [4] is given by

where ,

ds2 = ndt2 + n 1dr2 + r2dd2,

n = (cid:16)1 (cid:16)c

r (cid:17)(d3)(cid:17)

,

(1.12)

(1.13)

and d(d2) is the line element on the unit (d  2)-sphere.

considering directly the euclidean signature, the kruskal coordinates are dened by

e(2kr) =

1

4(cid:16)2 +  2(cid:17)

eikt = (cid:16)  i
 + i(cid:17)

1

2

r = z n 1dr = r + c (d3)z (cid:16)r(d3)  c (d3)(cid:17)1

dr

=

1

n  1

x  1



xn2 + 2xn3 + . . . + (n  2)x + (n  1)

xn1 + xn2 + . . . + x + 1

!

where

using

1

(cid:16)xn  1(cid:17)

it is easily seen, without evaluating r completely in terms of partial fractions, that

r = r +

c

(d  3) z

dr

r  c

+ h(r)

(1.14)

(1.15)

(1.16)

where the function h(r) plays no role concerning the singularity at the horizon at r = c.
this can be veried by consructing h(r) explicitly.

thus

where

ds2 = n(cid:16)4k2e2kr(cid:17)1(cid:16)d 2 + d2(cid:17) + r2d(d2),
d3(cid:17)e2kh(r)

= e2kr(cid:16)r  c(cid:17)(cid:16) 2kc

e2kr

3

(1.17)

hence, setting

k = 

(d  3)

2c

(1.18)

desingularizes the horizon. the domain [c, ] ensures the positive deniteness of (cid:16)2 +  2(cid:17)

in (1.14).

from (1.14) the period is now found to be

p(d) = 2|k|1 = 4c/(d  3)

(1.19)

for d = 4 and c = 2m one gets back the well known result

for the desitter case, for all d,

and the period remains

p(4) = 8m

n = (cid:16)1  r2(cid:17)

p = 2 1

2

(1.20)

another necessary ingredient in evaluating the actions of our solutions will be seen ( in
sec.3) to be the traces of the generators of so(d  1). this will, of course, depend on the
representation chosen. we will not always specify it in the following. but let us note here
briey the results for spinorial constructions of these generators.

let , for i 6= j,

l(n)

ij = 

i
2

(n)
i (n)

j

(1.21)

where (n)

i

are the -matrices for n spatial dimensions, satisfying the cliord algebra.
then the ls satisfy the so(n) algebra with hermitian convention. starting with the pauli
matrices for n = 3 and

one proceeds in alternate steps for even and odd dimensions as follows.

l(3)

ij = 

i

and

(2p)
i = 2  (2p1)

(i = 1, . . . , 2p  1)

(2p)
2p = 1  i(2p2)

4

(1.22)

(1.23)

(1.24)

in the next step, one sets, for n = (2p + 1),

(2p+1)
i

= (2p)

i

(i = 1, . . . , 2p)

(2p+1)
2p+1 = (2p)

2

. . . (2p)

2p  (2p)

2p+1

here (2p)

2p+1 is the generalization of the chiral matrix 5 for n = 4.

for even n one can take the chiral projections

1

2(cid:16)1  (2p)

2p+1(cid:17)l(2p)

ij

which reduces the dimension by a factor 2.

for such spinorial constructions,

t rl(n)

ij l(n)

ij  = (n)iijj 

(1.25)

(1.26)

(1.27)

where (ordering indices, say, as i < j) for odd n,

and for even n,

chiral projections give, for even n,

(n) = 2(n5)/2

(n) = 2(n4)/2

(n) = 2(n6)/2

(1.28)

2 metrics, ansatz for gauge elds and a class of solu-

tions for d  4:

we consider spherically symmetric, static metrics for dimensions d  4. for the ansatz to
be introduced below, the kerr - schild form of the metrics turn out to be convenient, for
computation, to start with. the complications due to the nondiagonal form will be amply
compensated by other good properties. in this form one has

g =  + ll,

g =   ll

(2.1)

where

and

00 = 00 = 1, ij = ij = ij

5

for static spherical symmetry l0 is a function of r only, where

ll = llg = 0

(2.2)

and

satisfying

r2 =

li = l0

and for desitter metric,for all d,

(c > 0)

( > 0)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

in this paper, seeking simplicity, we present explicit solutions for these two cases only.

the reissner-nordstrom case with

will be excluded. the standard form in spherical coordinates is given by

l2
0 = (c/r)d3  (d/r2)d3

ds2 = ndt2 + n 1dr2 + r2d(d2),

where d(d2) is the line element on the unit (d  2)-sphere and

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(for d = 4, for example, c = 2m and d = p 2 + q2 give back the well-known forms.) the
coordinate transformation relating (2.1) an (2.7), namely

0(cid:17)
n = (cid:16)1  l2

x0 = t +z dr

n

 r

(2.9)

does not aect our particularly simple ansatz for the gauge potentials to follow (with at =
ar = 0).

after constructing the solutions using (2.1) the passage to euclidean signature is best
considered ( rather than introducing imaginary l0) by directly starting from (2.7), leading to

ds2 = ndt2 + n 1dr2 + r2d(d2)

(2.10)

the ansatz for the gauge potentials is

a0

= 0

= r2(cid:16)k(r)  1(cid:17)lijxj

(i = 1, 2, . . . , d  1)

(2.11)

here lij = lji are hermitian so(d  1) rotation matrices satisfying

[lij, lij ] = i(cid:16)iiljj  + jj lii  ij lji  jilij (cid:17)

(2.12)

for constructing solutions the lie algebra is sucient. but for evaluating actions one
must specify the chosen representation before computing traces. of particular interest are
the cases discussed in sec.1. but one can implement other representations, if so desired.

where

and

f ij = gigjf = w1lij + w2(cid:16)xi(ljkxk)  xj(likxk)(cid:17)

(2.15)

(2.16)

the euler-lagrange equations of motion are, since | g |= 1 for the ks metric,

7

df  = f  + i[a, f ] = 0

(2.17)

it can be shown that

and

df 0 = 0

df j = r4(cid:16)r(d6) d

dr

(nr(d4) dk
dr

)  (d  3)k(k 2  1)(cid:17)(ljkxk)

hence the equations of motion reduce to a single constraint (with n = 1  l2

0),

d
dr

(nr(d4) dk
dr

) = (d  3)r(d6)k(k 2  1)

(2.18)

(2.19)

the factor (d  3) on the right corresponds to the fact that for d = 3 one has the abelian
case with only l12. we exclude this by setting d  4. the result (2.19) is obtained less
simply by using directly spherical coordinates and (2.7). the equation (2.19) does not satisfy
the painleve criterion [5]. though we cannot provide a general analysis, surprisingly simple
particular solutions have been found. interesting solutions can be found ,not for at space
with n = 1, but remarkably for the curved ones given by (2.4) and (2.5). the special
features arising for d = 5 will be discussed below.

2.1 case 1. schwarzschild background:

for

set

n = (cid:16)1  (c/r)d3(cid:17)

k =

r(d3) + ac (d3)
r(d3) + bc (d3)

inserting in (2.19) one obtains

3a + b(2d  7) + (d  1) = 0
a(a + b)  (d  5)b = 0

(2.20)

(2.21)

this involves essentially solving only a quadratic in a or b. for d = 4 our old results [1] are
reproduced. of the two real solutions only the one with

a = 2.366, b = 4.098

(2.22)

gives nite energy (action) for lorentz (euclidean) signature.

8

for d = 5 one has a very special case, as is evident from the second equation of (2.21).

now the solution

a = 0, b = (4/3)

(2.23)

leads to a divergent action since the domain of (r/c) is [1, ] and this includes a zero of
the denominator of k. but now one can also consider the at limit as follows.

setting, for (d = 5),

the set (2.21) reduces to

a = a/c 2, b = b/c 2

3(a + b) + 4c 2 = 0

a(a + b) = 0

hence as c  0, setting ( being an arbitrary real number)

one obtains

 a = b = 2

(k  1) = 

22

r2 + 2

substituting this in (2.11) it is seen that for the convention, say,

1234 = 1, l12 = l34

(cyclic)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

for the chirally projected 2  2 so(4) generators one obtains the famous bpst selfdual
solution in d = 4 as a static one in d = 5 via our limiting process. another convention gives
the antiselfdual form.

from d = 6 onwards the solutions become complex.the corresponding nite complex
action ,or energy, will be obtained in the follwing section. the exact values can be obtained,
for any d, immediately from (2.21). some numerical values, giving a direct idea of variation
with d, are given below. both upper or both lower signs are to be taken.for

b = 1.300  i0.900

b = 0.857  i0.742

d = 6 :
d = 7 :
d = 8 :
d = 9 :
d = 10 :

a = 0.500  i1.500,
a = 0  i1.732, ,
a = 0.167  i1.863,
a = 0.250  i1.984,
a = 0.300  i2.100,

b = 0.722  i0.621
b = 0.659  i0.541
b = 0.623  i0.485

(2.28)

2.2 case 2. desitter background:

for

n = (1  r2)

9

one can satisfy (2.19) by setting

k =

1 + ar2
1 + br2

with

a(a + b) + 2(d  5)b = 0
3(d  3)a  (d  11)b + 2(d  1) = 0

(2.29)

(2.30)

exact solutions can again be obtained by solving a quadratic in a or b. approximate nu-
merical values are presented below.

for d = 4 our old results [1,2] are reproduced with

a = i1.732, b = 0.857  i0.742

(2.31)

for the special case d = 5 the eqations reduce to

the one consistent solution

a(a + b) = 0
3(a + b) + 4 = 0

a = 0, b = (4/3)

(2.32)

(2.33)

leads to divergence in k since (see sec.3) one considers the domain 0  r2  1. a at
space limit can again be considered as for the schwarzschild case. this needs no repetition.
from d = 6 onwards ( exhibiting a behavior complemetary to the schwarzschild case )
the solutions become real. from d = 6 to d = 10, as will be seen in sec.3, one has two real
solutions, both giving nite action (or energy). for a and b one obtains the following results.
for d = 6:

(1) a = 0.807,
(2) a = 6.193,

b = 0.547
b = 9.147

(1) a = 0.910, ,
(2) a = 6.589,

b = 0.268
b = 16.768

for d = 7:

for d = 8:

(1) a = 0.901,
(2) a = 7.765,

b = 0.159
b = 34.159

(2.34)

10

for d = 9:

for d = 10:

(1) a = 0.877,
(2) a = 9.123,

b = 0.108
b = 74.108

(1) a = 0.853,
(2) a = 10.547,

b = 0.080
b = 203.480

in the set (1) the negetive value of b satisfy | b | 1 and in the set(2) b > 0. thus in both
cases divergence will be seen to be avoided (sec.3). one may notice that variations (with
d) are relatively small for the solutions (1) as compared to the solutions (2). it will be seen
however (sec.3) that the values of the action (or energy) for the two sets remain quite close
for each d.

for d = 11 there is a sudden change. there is only one real solution with

a = 0.833,

b = 0.062

(2.35)

if the numerical values of (a, b) for some particular d are are found to be of interest in

some context, they can be immediately obtained from (2.30).

3 action (energy) for euclidean (lorentz) signature:

since | g |= 1 for (2.1) and fi0 = 0 for our ansatz, for both signatures one computes, to start
with,

1
2

t rz dv(d1)(cid:16)fijf ij(cid:17)

(3.1)

where dv(d1) is the volume element for the spatial dimentions. for our static, spherically
symmetic ansatz the angular integrations merely give a factor equal to the surface area of
the unit (d  2)-sphere,namely,

(d2) =

2(d1)/2

((d  1)/2)

(3.2)

the radial integration corresponds, for schwarzschild and desitter backgrounds respectively,
to the domains

and

[c, ]

[0, 

1

2 ]

(3.3)

(3.4)

for lorentz signature (3.3) corresponds to the outer region down to the horizon at r = c.
for euclidean signature it corresponds to the full domain of reality of the kruskal-type

11

coordinates (sec.1). for both signatures (3.4) corresponds to the inner region bounded by
the horizon at r = 

2 .

1

for lorentz signature one thus obtains a nite energy for our solutions. for euclidean
signature the time becomes periodic, for the schwarzschild and the desitter metrics respec-
tively, with a period (sec.1),

p(d) =

4c

(d  3)

p =

2

1

2



(3.5)

(3.6)

hence by multiplying the integral (3.1) by p(d) and p respectively one obtains now the total
action. the radial integral will be real or complex according to the background and the
dimension considered. for complex solutions one can obtain a real action by considering
a doubled block-diagonal form of the rotation matrices lij and thus treating the complex
conjugate solutions together. keeping various possibilities in mind, at this stage , let us set
(using the ordering i < j to avoid ambiguities)

t r(lijlij ) = (d)iijj 

(3.7)

(see sec.1 for evaluation of (d) corresponding to spinorial constructions, setting d = (n+1).)
to evaluate (3.1) we need the traces, with (i, j = 1, . . . , d  1),

careful counting leads to

t1 = t r(lijlij)

t2 = r2t r(cid:16)lij(cid:16)(xiljkxk)  (xjlikxk)(cid:17)(cid:17)
t3 = r4t r(cid:16)(xiljkxk)  (xjlikxk)(cid:17)2

t1 = ((d)/2)(d  1)(d  2)
t2 = (d)(d  2)
t3 = (d)(d  2)

(3.8)

(3.9)

using (2.14) and (3.9) one obtains after grouping terms,

where now

the total euclidean action , for example, is

x(d3) + a
x(d3) + b

(1/2)p(d)(d2)(d)(d  2)c (d5)i(d)

for d = 4

p(4) = 4c = 8m, (2) = 4,

(4) = (1/2)

leading to a total action

82i(4) = 82(0.959)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

which reproduces exactly our old result [1].

leaving aside the exceptional case d = 5, we give below the values of i(d) for the so-
lutions (2.28). i(d) can be expressed in terms of standard integrals for the general case.
direct numerical evaluation gives , corresponding to the upper and the lower sign in (2.28)
respectively,

i(6) = 7.605  i9.141
i(7) = 7.021  i16.788
i(8) = 5.217  i25.378
i(9) = 2.109  i34.906
i(10) = 2.320  i45.312

(3.15)

note that the real part becomes negetive for d = 10, indicating dominant contribution of
terms biliear in the imaginary parts.

this is again our old result [1, 2].

leaving aside again the case d = 5, we give the values of i(d) for the solutions (2.34).
for each value of d (from 6 to 10) one now has two real solutions ((1) and (2) in (2.34)).
considering them in order one obtains the following values:

i(10) = 1.395

(3.19)

finite values are obtained in each case since (1 + br2) has no zero in the domain [0, 1]
of r2. for the anti-desitter case there is no horizon and our solutions, even apart from the
question of the values of b, lead to divergent actions due to asymptotic properties for d  6.

4 remarks:

various aspects of nonselfdual solutions have been studied by a number of authors. an
incomplete list of references is provided [6,7,8,9,10,11]. here we have shown how the simplest
static, spherically symmetric curved spaces provide surprising new possibilities. our results
are not limited to existence theorems. we provide explicit solutions and hence complete
information concerning the gauge potentials at every space-time point. the simplicity of our
solutions should permit a relatively easy study of normal modes and (un)stability properties.
maintaining the spherical symmetry one can proceed as for sphalerons [12,13,14,15,16], the
best known class of nonselfdual solutions. the starting point, without higgs elds and with
our explicit solutions for the gauge potentials, should be even simpler. such a study would
yet involve considerable numerical computations. it is deferred to another paper. but we
add some relevant comments.

14

we started by pointing out the striking fact that the action (1.7) of our nonselfdual
solution (schwarzschild,d = 4) is lower than that for the lowest-action, non-trivial, selfdual
solution (p = 1). but our solution is not topologically stabilized. as an evident consequence
of f0i = 0 it has zero index (p = 0). considering only fij, it is seen that as r   the
magnitude falls faster ( r3) than that for a monopole. presumably our solution provides
a minimal saddle-point between two topologically distinct vacua. but a precise statement
needs further study. apart from the common factors ( 4 from angular integrations and
8m for the period) one can compare the radial contributions. the action densities of the
selfdual and the nonselfdual cases are respectively

(4.2)

as r   both fall as r4 but for (4.2) with a larger numerical coecient. on the other hand
(4.2) starts from a lower value at r = 2m. the total eects are given by (1.9) and (1.7)
respectively. one further point should be noted. for euclidean signature selfdual gauge
eld congurations, having zero enegy-momentum tensor, do not perturb the metric. thus
one obtains, eectively, a solution for the combined gravitation-gauge eld system. for a
nonselfdual system this is no longer the case. hence there a background approximation (
ignoring the back reaction of the gauge eld on the metric) is involved. but again, this is
true not only for cuved but also for a at background, the latter being held xed to be at
even in presence of other elds.

for desitter background (d = 4) we obtained a pair of complex solutions. the conformal
properties of the metric and of gauge elds in four dimensions permitted us to reinterprete
our static solutions as time-dependent complex ones in at space-time [2]. this is in sharp
contrast to the schwarzschild case where the solution vanishes with m.

after the very special case of d = 5, discussed separately, from d = 6 onwards the com-
plementary behaviours for these metrics continue with a crossover. schwarzschild solutions
become complex while the desitter ones become real. it is remarkable that both real solu-
tions (d = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) give nite action, the ratio of the two actions changing slowly with
d. the prospect of mapping out the action landscape, with ridges and valleys, in the neigh-
bourhoods of these solutions is intriguing. the special nature of d = 11 has been pointed in
(2.35).

the solutions of the standard yang-mills lagrangian are no longer independent of con-
formal factors in the metric for d > 4. (in particular, the lack of scale invariance is signalled
by the persistence of the parameters c and  in the actions.) so a direct passage to at
space is not possible , preventing a comparison of the actions of our real desitter soutions
with those of possible at-space solutions in higher dimensions  the fundamental octonionic

15

instanton [17,18] in eight dimensions, for example. for a lagrangian quartic in f con-
formal invariance is restored in 8 dimensions.( see ref.19 and the references cited there for
the general case of 4p dimensions.) but our class of nonselfdual solutions have not been
constructed in the framework of these generalized lagrangians.

we have left various possible generalizations unexplored. to start with one can consider
more general metrics as backgrounds. solving (2.19) with n given by the reissner-nordstrom
metric is the most immediate possibilty.( but one encounters here new problems.) for both
d = 4 and d = 8 the kerr metric can be related to the schwarzschild one through an imagi-
nary translation [20]. one can implement a corresponding translation in the gauge potentials
to see whether it can be adapted, or not, to obtain solutions for kerr backgrounds. the ads
background, briey introduced in the appendix, evidently deserves a more thorough study.
we hope to explore such possibilities elsewhere.

one reason for presenting our solutions, restricted as they are, is the pleasant simplicity
attained. we show that curvature, in some cases, can open doors rather than erect barriers.
another reason is the current broad interest, in the context of strings and branes, in solutions
for higher dimnsions. without citing references, let us state that nonselfdual, non-bps,
solutions deserve scrutiny.

appendix: a nonselfdual solution for ads4 background.

for d = 4 a divergent solution in desitter background was shown [1,3] to be related through
conformal transformations to meron-type solutions in at space-time. this, particularly
simple, solution corresponds (with  > 0) to

n = (1  r2), k = n  1

2 = (1  r2) 1

2

(a.1)

here we note that changing the sign before  one obtains the anti-desitter case (ads4) and

n = (1 + r2), k = n  1

2 = (1 + r2) 1

this provides a solution of (2.19) with d = 4 namely of

d

dr(cid:16)n

dk

dr (cid:17) = r2k(cid:16)k 2  1(cid:17)

(a.2)

(a.3)

where now k is no longer singular. henceforth, in the appendix, we set  = 1 for simplic-
ity.the radial integral (3.16), in absence of the horizon,should now be replaced by

where

one obtains

i(4) = z 

0

dxx2(cid:16)2n(cid:16)x

dx (cid:17)2

+(cid:16)k 2  1(cid:17)2(cid:17)

n = (1 + x2), k = (1 + x2) 1

i(4) = 3z

thus ,corresponding to (3.10), one obtains a nite spatial integral

(a.4)

(a.5)

(a.6)

the factor from the time integration depends on the chosen context. now there is no horizon
to be desingularized and the discussion of sec.1 is not directly relevant. but one can start
by considering the hypersurface

 t2

2 + x2

1 + x2

2 + x2

in terms of the spherical coordinates

(x1, x2, x3)  (r, , )

(t1, t2)  (t, )

17

(a.7)

(a.8)

the metric on the hypersurface

r2  t 2 = 1

is

ds2 = (1 + r2)d2 + (1 + r2)1dr2 + r2d2

in this context the -integration gives a factor 2 and one obtains a total action

33

(a.9)

(a.10)

but often it is preferable to consider the covering space (cads) replacing   s1 by t  r.
then the action is evidently divergent.

the solution of (a.1) with the square root involved for k seems to be specic to d = 4.
but it would be interesting to search for suitable generalizations, related to this class, for
higher dimensions.
