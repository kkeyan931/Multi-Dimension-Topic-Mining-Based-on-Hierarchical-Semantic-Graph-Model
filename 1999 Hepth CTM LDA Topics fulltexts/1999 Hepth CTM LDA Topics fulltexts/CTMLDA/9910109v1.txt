1 introduction

it is now generally appreciated that dirichlet branes (d-branes) [1, 2, 3] play a central role in the
non-perturbative description of string theory. d-branes are solitonic solutions of the underlying
supergravity theory but they have also a description in terms of open strings; this allows for an
essentially perturbative treatment of d-branes.

the d-branes that were rst analysed were bps states that break half the (spacetime) su-
persymmetry. it has now been realised however that, because of their description in terms of
open strings, d-branes can be constructed and analysed in much more general situations.
in
fact, d-branes are essentially described by a boundary conformal eld theory [4, 5, 6, 7], the
consistency conditions of which are not related to spacetime supersymmetry [8, 9, 10]. in an
independent development, d-branes that break supersymmetry have been constructed in terms
of bound states of branes and anti-branes by sen [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. this construction has
been interpreted in terms of k-theory by witten [17], and this has opened the way for a more
mathematical treatment of d-branes [18, 19, 20].

the d-brane spectrum of a number of theories is understood in detail. these include the
standard ten-dimensional type iia, iib and i theory (see [21] for a review), as well as their
non-supersymmetric cousins, type 0a, 0b and 0 [8, 10, 22]. it is understood how the d-brane
spectrum is modied upon compactication on some supersymmetric orbifolds and near ale
singularities [23, 16, 24, 25, 26, 27]. there has also been progress in understanding the d-brane
spectrum of gepner models [28, 29] and wzw theories [30, 31, 32, 33, 34].

in this paper we analyse systematically the d-brane spectrum of zz2 orbifolds of toroidal
compactications of iia/iib superstring theory1. we describe in detail the boundary states
that dene the dierent d-branes, and show that the resulting spectrum is in agreement with
the k-theory predictions which we determine independently. we also nd the charge densities
of the branes, and exhibit (for a number of examples) the dierence between the k-theory
group describing the d-brane charges and cohomology. our analysis works equally well for
supersymmetric theories as well as for theories without supersymmetry, thus emphasising once
again that d-branes do not intrinsically depend on supersymmetry.

the paper is organised as follows.

in section 2, we describe the perturbative and non-
perturbative (d-brane) spectrum of the theories in question. section 3 gives a brief account
of the k-theory calculation in the uncompactied case. this is modied in section 4 to take
into account the eect of the toroidal compactication. in section 5 we determine the charge
densities, and section 6 contains some concluding remarks. we have included three appendices
where some of the more technical details can be found.

1this class of compactications contains supersymmetric orbifolds such as the ones analysed in [16, 24, 27],

but also non-supersymmetric theories.

2 the dirichlet brane spectrum

in the rst subsection we describe briey the spectrum of the various orbifold theories we shall
be considering. in subsection 2.2 we then identify the consistent boundary states which form the
building blocks for the dirichlet branes.

2.1 orbifold theories

the orbifold theories we consider are all zz2 orbifolds of either type iia or type iib theory,
where the non-trivial generator of the orbifold group is of the form

g1 = in

or

g2 = in(1)fl .

(2.1)

here in describes the reection of n coordinates, and (1)fl acts as 1 on left-moving spacetime
bosons and fermions, respectively. the action of gi describes a symmetry of type ii theories if
n is even, and we shall therefore only consider this case. in the rst instance we shall assume
that the theory is ten-dimensional, but later on (in sections 4 and 5) we shall also discuss how
the analysis is modied if the n directions on which in acts are compactied on an n-torus. in
this case, t-duality relates

and similarly

iia on t n/in  iib on t n/in(1)fl ,

iia on t n/in(1)fl  iib on t n/in .

(2.2)

(2.3)

the orbifold theory is only supersymmetric if n = 4 mod 4, but the dirichlet brane spectrum can
also be studied if this is not the case since the analysis does not rely on spacetime supersymmetry
[8, 10].

let us start by describing the bosonic (closed string) spectrum of these theories that is relevant
for the description of the boundary states. in the untwisted sector there are the states in the
nsns and the rr sectors that are invariant under the orbifold projection 1
2(1 + g) (where
g = g1 or g = g2), and the gso-projection

ns-ns 1
rr

4 (cid:16)1 + (1)f(cid:17)(cid:16)1 + (1) f(cid:17)
4 (cid:16)1 + (1)f(cid:17)(cid:16)1  (1) f(cid:17) ,

1

(2.4)

where, in the second line, the  sign corresponds to type iia and the + sign to type iib. in
the twisted sector, the moding for the excitations corresponding to the n directions along which
in acts is half-integral for bosons and the r-sector world-sheet fermions, and integral for the

3

ns-sector world-sheet fermions. furthermore, the ground state energy vanishes in the twisted
r-sector, and is

(n  4)

8

ans,t =

(2.5)

in the twisted ns-sector. if the orbifold projection does not involve (1)fl, i.e. if g = g1, then
the gso-projection in the twisted sector is the same as (2.4). on the other hand, for g = g2, the
left-moving gso-projection is opposite to (2.4) in all twisted sectors. furthermore, the states in
the twisted sector also have to be invariant under the orbifold symmetry.

the lowest lying states in the twisted rr sector are always massless, and transform as
a tensor product of two spinor representations of so(8  n) (where so(8  n) acts on the
unreected 8  n coordinates in light-cone gauge); this tensor product can be decomposed into
antisymmetric tensor representations of so(8 n). the orbifold projection is very simple in this
case since the twisted r-sector does not have any fermionic zero modes along the n directions of
in. all massless (gso-invariant) states of the twisted rr sector are therefore physical.
in the twisted ns-ns sector, the lowest lying states are massless for n = 4, massive for n > 4,
and tachyonic for n = 2. they transform as a tensor product of two spinor representations of
so(n) (where so(n) acts on the n coordinates that are reected by in); from the point of view
of the 8  n unreected directions these states are scalars. on the ground states, the orbifold
projection is proportional to the gso-projection, and all gso-invariant ground states are again
physical.

we should mention at this stage that the denition of in in the untwisted r-r sector is in

general ambiguous: on the ground states we can either dene in to be

(2.7)

n but for n = 2 mod (4), i (1)

n = i (2)

n ; for n = 2 mod (4), we then have in(1)fl = i (2)
n .

these two expressions dier by the order of the fermionic zero modes; for n = 4 mod (4),
i (1)
n = i (2)
n . in this paper we shall use the convention that
in refers to i (1)
for n = 2 mod 4, there is furthermore, at least a priori, an ambiguity in how to dene the
gso-projection in each of the twisted sectors; this is due to the fact that in order to guarantee
that (1)f and (1) f are of order two, one has to introduce non-trivial phases which are only
determined up to signs. as we shall explain in appendix b, these ambiguities are uniquely xed
if we require that the theory has at least one fractional d-brane. this convention leads to a
d-brane spectrum that is consistent with the results obtained independently using k-theory.

2.2 the boundary state analysis

let us rst introduce a convenient notation to describe the allignement of the d-branes relative to
the n preferred directions along which in acts. for deniteness, let us assume that in reects the
coordinates x9n, . . . , x8; we then say that a dirichlet p-brane is of type (r, s) where p = r + s if it
has r+1 neumann directions along x0, . . . , x8n, x9, and s neumann directions along x9n, . . . , x8.
we shall always work in light-cone gauge (with light-cone directions x0 and x9), and therefore
the actual d-brane states we shall analyse will have dirichlet boundary conditions along the two
light cone directions, and thus be d-instantons. as usual, we shall assume that we can perform
an appropriate wick-rotation to transform these states back to ordinary d-branes [35].

the analysis we shall now describe is very similar to that performed in [8, 12, 9] (see also
[4, 5]), and we shall therefore be rather sketchy. (some details of the construction can however be
found in appendix a.) a d-brane is described by a linear combination of physical boundary states
that satises a certain compatibility condition. for each set of boundary conditions, there exists
at most one non-trivial gso and orbifold invariant boundary state in each sector (untwisted
nsns and rr , and twisted nsns and rr ), which is unique up to normalisation. the
compatibility condition requires that the spectrum of states that is induced by the presence of
a collection of d-branes denes open strings that have consistent interactions with the original
closed string theory. these open strings can be determined, using world-sheet duality, from the
corresponding closed string tree diagrams that describes the exchange of a closed string state
between two d-branes.

one aspect of this consistency condition is the requirement that the string that begins and
ends on the same d-brane must be a suitably projected open string. this implies that the actual
d-brane state consists of non-trivial boundary states from dierent sectors. in fact, there exist
three dierent possibilities: the boundary state describes either a fractional d-brane, i.e. it is a
linear combination of non-trivial boundary states from all four sectors,

|d(r, s)i =

(|d(r, s)insns + 1|d(r, s)irr + 12|d(r, s)insns ,t + 2|d(r, s)irr ,t) ,

1
2

(2.8)
a bulk d-brane, i.e. it is a linear combination involving only the untwisted nsns and rr
sectors
(2.9)
or a truncated d-brane, i.e. it is a linear combination involving only the untwisted nsns and
the twisted rr sector,

|d(r, s)ib = |d(r, s)insns + |d(r, s)irr ,

| d(r, s)i = n2

(|d(r, s)insns + |d(r, s)irr ,t) .

(2.10)

here  and 1,2 are 1 and describe the signs with respect to the dierent charges, the relative
normalisations are determined by the consistency condition, and n is a normalisation constant

5

that will be determined further below. the rst two d-brane states (2.8) and (2.9) are conven-
tional d-branes that are bps provided that the orbifold preserves supersymmetry, whereas the
state in (2.10) describes a non-bps brane.

not all of these d-brane states are independent: two fractional d-branes with 1 = 

1 and
2 = 
2 can combine to form a bulk d-brane state (2.9); as it turns out, whenever a bulk d-
brane exists, then so does the corresponding fractional brane, and we may thus restrict ourselves,
without loss of generality, to considering only fractional and truncated d-brane states.

the condition that a string with both endpoints on the same truncated brane denes a
consistent open string requires that n 2  in; the minimal value is therefore n = 1. on the
other hand, the compatibility condition also requires that a string which begins on any one of
these branes and ends on any other one, must describe an open string. if for a given (r, s), a
fractional d-brane state exists, then the open string from the fractional (r, s) to the truncated
(r, s) d-brane leads to the partition function

2n (ns  r)

1

2 (cid:16)1 + g(1)f(cid:17) .

(2.11)

this only denes an open string partition function if n is an integer multiple of 2, and the
minimal value is then n = 2. in this case, the mass and the charge of the truncated d-brane
is precisely twice that of the fractional d-brane; thus the truncated d-brane can decay into two
fractional d-branes with 1 = 
2, and does not describe an independent stable
state.

1 and 2 = 

in summary we therefore nd that for a given (r, s) at most one of the above three d-brane
states is fundamental, and that the other two (if they exist) can be obtained as bound states
of the fundamental d-brane. this fundamental d-brane is either fractional or truncated. the
fundamental d-brane is only stable provided that the open string that begins and ends on it does
not have a tachyon. this is always the case for a fractional d-brane; in the case of a truncated
d-brane the stability of the brane depends on the actual value of the compactication radii. in
fact, if the theory is uncompactied, a truncated d-brane is unstable if and only if s > 0, and in
the compactied case it is stable provided that the radii of the tangential circles are suciently
small (and the radii of the circles transverse to the brane are suciently large) [16, 24, 27].

the d-brane spectrum can now be determined by analysing which of the dierent boundary
components are gso- and orbifold invariant. the detailed analysis is described in appendix b,
and the nal result is

(i)

(ii)

iia by in: fractional (r, s) d-branes exist for r and s both even.
truncated (r, s) d-branes exist for r even and s odd.
iib by in: fractional (r, s) d-branes exist for r odd and s even.
truncated (r, s) d-branes exist for both r and s odd.

6

(iii)

(iv)

iia by in(1)fl: fractional (r, s) d-branes exist for r and s both odd.
truncated (r, s) d-branes exist for r odd and s even.
iib by in(1)fl: fractional (r, s) d-branes exist for r even and s odd.
truncated (r, s) d-branes exist for both r and s even.

in the uncompactied theory, a fractional d-brane has two charges (1 and 2), and a truncated
d-brane has only a single charge; the corresponding k-theory groups should therefore either be
zz  zz or zz, depending on (r, s) as above. strictly speaking, one should only trust this analysis
for s = 0, since the truncated d-brane is otherwise unstable. however, as we shall see in the
next section, the k-theory result agrees with the above even for s 6= 0.
will be discussed in some detail in section 4.

the situation is somewhat clearer in the case where all n directions are compactied; this

3 k-theory analysis in the uncompactied theory

in this section we demonstrate that the above results can be reproduced in terms of k-theory.
here we shall only consider the uncompactied theory; the compactied case will be discussed
in section 4. we shall discuss type iib in some detail in the rst subsection, and type iia is
analysed in section 3.2.

3.1 k-theory of type iib

the analysis of the d-brane spectrum in type iib orbifolds is relatively straightforward. if the
zz2 orbifold leaves the d9-brane invariant (i.e. if it is of type g = g1), the d-brane spectrum is
described in terms of equivariant k-theory kzz2 [36] of the space transverse to the worldvolume
of the dirichlet brane; on the other hand, if the orbifold maps the d9-brane to its anti-brane
(i.e. if it is of type g = g2), the relevant k-theory group is k [17]. for a given (r, s) brane, the
transverse space has dimension 9 (r + s), of which n s directions are inverted under the action
of in. in order to distinguish between the directions on which in does or does not act, we denote
the transverse space (as in [19]) by irns,9nr. the k-theory groups we want to determine are
then

kzz2(irns,9nr)

and

k(irns,9nr) .

(3.1)

the d-brane congurations of interest are equivalent to the vacuum at transverse innity; in
terms of k-theory this means that the pairs of bundles (e, f ) that dene the elements of k-
theory have the property that e is isomorphic to f near innity [17]. the corresponding k-theory
is usually called k-theory with compact support. by a theorem of hopkins, k(irl,m) is given as

k(irl,m) = k 1

zz2(irl+1,m) = kzz2(irl+1,m+1) ,

(3.2)

7

where the last equality follows from the compact support condition. the calculation of k(irl,m)
therefore reduces to that of the equivariant k-theory groups. this has been calculated before by
gukov [19], and the result is

kzz2(irl,m) = 


0
zz
r[zz2] = zz  zz if m and l are even,

if m is odd,
if m is even and l is odd,

(3.3)

where r[g] is the representation ring of the group g. this is precisely in agreement with the
results of the boundary analysis that we described in the previous section.

we shall now give a dierent derivation of (3.3) that is due to segal [37]. firstly, because of

bott periodicity, the answer depends only on the parity of l and m. if l is even we have

kzz2(ir2l,m) = kzz2(ir0,m) = ( 0

if m is odd,
r[zz2] = zz  zz if m is even,

(3.4)

where we have used the fact that zz2 acts freely on ir0,m. in order to calculate kzz2(ir1,m) we
observe that

zz2(x  ir1,0) = k 
k 

(3.5)
where x is an arbitrary manifold on which zz2 acts continuously, and s0  d1  ir1,0 are the
one-dimensional circle (i.e. the two points 1) and the one-dimensional disk (i.e. the interval
[1, 1]), respectively. the group zz2 acts on s0 and d1 by reection. because of (3.5), the long
exact sequence can be written as

zz2(x  d1, x  s0) ,

    k 1

zz2(x  s0)  k 0
 k 0

zz2(x  ir1,0)  k 0
zz2(x  s0)  k 1

zz2(x  d1)
zz2(x  ir1,0)  k 1

by homotopy equivalence, we have k 
the zz2 action is free. thus for x = irl,m with l and m even, the exact sequence becomes

zz2(x), and k 

zz2(x  d1) = k 

zz2(x  d1)     (3.6)
zz2(x  s0) = k (x) since

0  k 0

zz2(irl,m  ir1,0)  r[zz2]  zz  k 1

zz2(irl,m  ir1,0)  0 ,

(3.7)

where we have used (3.4), k 0(irl,m) = zz and k 1(irl,m) = 0. the map from r(zz2) = zz  zz to
zz is given by (m, n) 7 m + n (which is onto), and it follows that

zz2(irl,m  ir1,0) = zz ,
k 0
zz2(irl,m  ir1,0) = 0 .
k 1

(3.8)

(3.9)

thus for l = m = 0 we obtain the desired result.

8

3.2 orbifolds of type iia

the d-brane spectrum of type iia theory is given in terms of the k-theory groups k 1(x)
[17, 18]. the elements of k 1(x) can be thought of as pairs (e, ), where e is a bundle on
x, and  a bundle-automorphism [38].
in terms of string theory, the d-branes of type iia
theory can be obtained from (unstable) d9-branes by tachyon condensation. this can then be
interpreted directly in terms of the pairs (e, ), where e is the bundle on the d9-branes, and
the automorphism  is related to the tachyon eld t by

 = eit .

(3.10)

this construction also applies to the orbifold theories in question, except that now the tachyon
eld has to be invariant under the orbifold action. in terms of k-theory, the relevant group is
then the equivariant group k 1
zz2(x) that consists of pairs (e, ), where  commutes with the zz2
action [37]. more precisely, the k-theory groups are

k 1

zz2(irns,9nr)

and

k 1

 (irns,9nr) ,

(3.11)

where again the rst case corresponds to g1, and the second to g2 orbifolds. as before irns,9nr
denotes the transverse space to a (r, s)-brane. because of the compact support condition, k 1
can be evaluated using equation (3.2). explicitly this gives



k 1

zz2(irns,9nr) = kzz2(irns,10nr)

and

k 1

 (irns,9nr) = k(irns,10nr) ,

(3.12)
and thus the evaluation of k-groups relevant to the type iia orbifolds under consideration
follows from equation (3.3), and is in precise agreement with the results of the boundary state
analysis described in the previous section.

4 the compactied case

in this section we analyse the d-brane spectrum for the case when all n coordinates along
which in acts are compactied on a torus. we shall rst describe how the k-theory analysis is
modied; we shall then explain how this matches precisely the results that can be obtained using
the boundary state formalism.

4.1 relative k-theory

the d-brane spectrum of toroidally compactied type ii string theories can be described in
terms of relative k-theory [20], and the relevant k-theory groups are therefore
(s9nr  t n, t n) .
k 

zz2(s9nr  t n, t n)
k 

(4.1)

and

9

here the involution acts on t n with 2n xed points and has trivial action on s9nr, where
s9nr is the one-point compactication of the space ir9nr transverse to the brane in the
uncompactied directions. the d-branes of interest are trivial at innity, and the k-theory
groups are therefore the relative k-theory groups that describe pairs of bundles (e, f ) where e
and f are isomorphic at {}  t n. the k-theory groups only classify branes with xed r; in
terms of our previous discussion, these k-theory groups therefore correspond to products over
dierent values of s.

t n we have

let us rst compute the equivariant relative k-theory groups. since t n is a retract of s9nr
(4.2)
zz2(s9nrt n) to denote the unreduced equivariant k-theory

zz2(s9nr  t n, t n)  k 
k 
zz2(t n) and k 

here, we may take k 
groups. the former have been computed [37]

zz2(s9nr  t n) .

zz2(t n) = k 

kzz2(t n) = 3  2n1 zz ,
zz2(t n) = 0 ,
k 1

where we use the notation that nzz  zzn. furthermore we have

zz2(x  s2k) = k 
k 
zz2(x  s2k+1) = k 
k 

zz2(x)  k 
zz2(x)  k 1

zz2(x) ,
zz2 (x) .

taking these identities together and using the fact that n is even we then nd that

kzz2(s9nr  t n, t n) = ( 3  2n1zz r odd,
zz2(s9nr  t n, t n) = ( 3  2n1zz r even,

r even,

r odd.

k 1

0

0

next we consider k. as before we have

(s9nr  t n, t n)  k 
k 

(t n) = k 

(s9nr  t n) ,

(4.3)
(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

which we have now written in terms of the reduced k-groups. because of the theorem of hopkins
we have

k m

 (t n) = k m1
k m
 (s9nr  t n) = k m1

zz2 (t n  ir1,0) ,
zz2 (s9nr  t n  ir1,0) .

using (4.5) and (4.6) this implies that

k m

 (s9nr  t n, t n) = ( k m+1

zz2 (t n  ir1,0) r odd,
zz2(t n  ir1,0)
k m
r even .

10

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

to compute k 
(4.4) this becomes

zz2(t n  ir1,0) we consider next the long exact sequence (3.6) with x = t n. using

0  k 1(t n)  kzz2(t n  ir1,0)  kzz2(t n)  k(t n)  k 1

zz2(t n  ir1,0)  0 ,

(4.13)

where we have observed that for compact manifolds k-theory with compact support is the same as
reduced k-theory. it is easy to see that (4.13) remains true if we replace the two reduced k-groups
by their corresponding unreduced groups. we can then use (4.3) together with k (t n) = 2n1zz
to rewrite this as

0  2n1 zz  kzz2(t n  ir1,0)

 3  2n1 zz

 2n1 zz  k 1

zz2(t n  ir1,0)  0 .

(4.14)

since  is injective and the forgetting map  is onto we then nd that

kzz2(t n  ir1,0) = 3  2n1 zz ,
k 1
zz2(t n  ir1,0) = 0 .

finally, we thus have

 (s9nr  t n, t n) = ( 3  2n1zz r odd,
k(s9nr  t n, t n) = ( 3  2n1zz r even,

r even,

r odd.

k 1

0

0

(4.15)
(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

in agreement with t-duality (2.2), (2.3), these k-theory groups are the same as (4.7) and (4.8),
respectively.

4.2 compact boundary states

boundary states for d-branes that extend along compact (and inverted) directions have been
analysed before [12, 27].
in essence the boundary states are described by the same formulae
that we have given in section 2.2 and appendix a.1; there are however a few (minor) dierences.
firstly, the branes can wind along the internal directions of the torus, and therefore carry appro-
priate winding numbers. secondly, the orbifold has 2n xed points in the compactied case, and
there are therefore 2n dierent twisted sectors. for s > 0 the d-branes extend along the internal
directions, and the corresponding boundary states have a contribution from 2s of these twisted
(in fact, the 2s twisted sectors correspond to the 2s endpoints of the s-dimensional
sectors.
world-volume of the brane along the internal directions.) the structure of the boundary states,
and in particular the normalisation of the dierent boundary components, is described in detail
in appendix a.

11

in all known examples [39] (see also section 5), the only charges that are conserved in the
various decay processes among d-branes are the r-r charges in the untwisted and twisted sectors.
as we have just seen, there are 2n dierent twisted r-r sectors; if for a given r, the corresponding
twisted r-r boundary state is allowed, there are then 2n dierent twisted r-r sector charges.
as regards the charges in the untwisted r-r sector, these arise from the 10-dimensional r-r
forms upon compactication on the dierent cycles of the torus. if the orbifold is of type g1, the
relevant cycles are even-dimensional, and we therefore get

whereas for g2 we have

xl=1

l odd

l! = 2n1 ,

l! = 2n1 .

(4.19)

(4.20)

it follows from the analysis in section 2 and appendix b that the condition on r for the twisted
r-r sector boundary component to be consistent is the same as that for the untwisted r-r sector
component. thus, if r satises this condition, there are altogether

n = 2n + 2n1 = 3  2n1

(4.21)

r-r charges that form a lattice of dimension 3 2n1 (and otherwise there are none). since these
are the only charges that are conserved in transitions between dierent d-branes, the actual
d-brane charges form then a sublattice of this lattice.

in general this sublattice is not the whole lattice (see in particular appendix c for a concrete
example), but it is of maximal rank; this follows from the fact that it contains yet another
sublattice, namely the lattice of d-brane charges that is generated by the bulk and the truncated
d-branes.
(this is clearly of maximal rank since the bulk d-branes are only charged under
the untwisted r-r sector, whereas the truncated d-branes are only charged under the dierent
twisted r-r sectors.) it therefore follows that the lattice of d-brane charges is 3  2n1zz if r
satises the appropriate condition, and zero otherwise. this is consistent with the result that
follows from k-theory.

5 charge densities

in this section we determine the charge densities of the dierent d-branes that we have described
in this paper. we shall from now on always consider the compactied case.

12

5.1 descent relations

as we have mentioned before, various d-branes can decay into one another. the basic phe-
nomenon from which all others can be obtained is that of a truncated d-brane d(r, s) decaying
into two fractional d(r, s)-branes with s = s + 1 or into two fractional d(r, s)-branes with
s = s  1. since the r-r sector charges are conserved by these processes, this implies certain
relations between the charges of the dierent d-branes. in order to obtain these we introduce
the following notation. let us label the 2n xed points by 1, . . . , 2n. a (r, s) d-brane is charged
under 2s of these 2n xed points, and we include their labels as suces, i.e. the (r, s) brane that
is charged under the xed points n1, . . . , n2s is denoted by

(r, s)n1,...,n2s .

(5.1)

if the charge with respect to one of the twisted r-r sectors is opposite, we place a bar over the
corresponding label; similarly, if a fractional d-brane has opposite untwisted r-r sector charge,
we place a bar over s in (5.1).

the basic decay processes can now be described as follows: a truncated d(r, s) brane can

decay into two fractional d-branes with s = s + 1 as

d(r, s)n1,...,n2s  d(r, s + 1)n1,...,n2s ,m1,...,m2s + d(r, s + 1)n1,...,n2s ,m1,...,m2s ,

or it can decay into two fractional d-branes with s = s  1 as

d(r, s)n1,...,n2s  d(r, s  1)n1,...,n2s1 + d(r, s  1)n2s1+1,...,n2s .

(5.2)

(5.3)

it follows from this observation that the twisted r-r sector charge of a fractional d-brane d(r, s+
1) at each xed point is half that of a truncated d-brane d(r, s), and that the twisted r-r sector
charge of a fractional d-brane d(r, s  1) at each xed point is the same as that of a truncated
d-brane d(r, s). we can apply this argument repeatedly to express the charge of any d-brane
in terms of that of the brane with s = 0. there are two cases to consider: if the orbifold is of
type g1, the (r, 0) brane is fractional, and we have

d(r, 2k)
d(r, 2k + 1)

(r,2k) = 2k

(r,2k+1) = 2k


(r,0) ,
(r,0) ,

(5.4)

where 
orbifold of type g2, the (r, 0) brane is truncated, and we nd instead

(r,s) denotes the twisted r-r charge density of the a d(r, s)-brane. similarly, if the

d(r, 2k + 1)
d(r, 2k)

(r,2k+1) = 2k1

(r,2k) = 2k


(r,0) .

(r,0) ,

(5.5)

these relations can also be obtained from the normalisation constants of the various branes that
are determined in appendix a; see in particular eq. (a.27), (a.29).

13

5.2 the overall normalisation

the above considerations only determine the twisted charges up to an overall factor. in order
to nd this normalisation constant we shall now compare the (open) string theory calculation
with a eld theory calculation [3]. we shall only consider the compactied case; because of the
arguments of section 5.1 it is then sucient to do the calculation for a brane with s = 0.

if the orbifold theory is of type g1, the (r, 0) brane is fractional, and its open string has the

(10n

6 conclusions

in this paper we have analysed systematically the d-branes of certain zz2 orbifolds of (toroidal
compactications) of type iia/iib string theory. we have determined the corresponding k-
theory groups, and we have found complete agreement with the results obtained from a boundary
state analysis. we have also calculated the relevant charge densities.

it is straightforward to generalise this analysis to the case of compactications of type 0a
and 0b. in this case, the selection rules will be the same as those described in section 2 (and
section 4) for the corresponding case of type iia and iib, but the number of distinct branes for
each value of (r, s) will be doubled. the charge densities will also be modied accordingly.

it would be interesting to determine the world-volume actions of the branes we have considered

in this paper; work in this direction is in progress [40].

a construction and normalisation of boundary states

in this appendix we determine the normalisation constants of the boundary states for the orbifold
theories under consideration. we shall use the conventions of [12, 27]. let us rst consider the
uncompactied case.

15

a.1 the uncompactied case

in each (bosonic) sector of the theory we can construct the boundary state

|b(r, s), k, i = exp




xl>0(cid:20)1

l


ls 

l(cid:21) + i



xm>0h

ms



mi
|b(r, s), k, i(0) ,

(a.1)

where, depending on the sector, l and m are integer or half-integer, and k denotes the momentum
of the ground state. we shall always work in light-cone gauge with light-cone directions x0 and
x9; thus  and  take the values 1, . . . , 8. we shall also drop the dependence on  from now on.
the parameter  =  describes the two dierent spin structures [4, 5], and the matrix s

encodes the boundary conditions of the dp-brane which we shall always take to be diagonal

s = diag(1, . . . ,1, 1, . . . , 1) ,

(a.2)

where p + 1 entries are equal to 1, 7  p entries are equal to +1, and p = r + s. if there are
fermionic zero modes, the ground state in (a.1) satises an additional condition. (this will be
relevant in appendix b; see for example (b.3) and (b.11).)

in order to obtain a localised d-brane, we have to take the fourier transform of the above

boundary state, where we integrate over the directions transverse to the brane,

|b(r, s), y, i = z 

 y transverse

dkeiky

 dk0eik0y0 dk9eik9y9 |b(r, s), k, i ,

(a.3)

y denotes the location of the boundary state, and in the twisted sectors the momentum integral
only involves transverse directions that are not inverted by the orbifold action. in the following
we shall always consider (without loss of generality) the case y = 0 in which case the boundary
state is denoted by |b(r, s), i.
the invariance of the boundary state under the gso-projection always requires that the
physical boundary state is a linear combination of the two states corresponding to  = . using
the conventions of appendix b, these linear combinations are of the form

|b(r, s)insns =
|b(r, s)irr =
|b(r, s)insns ,t =
|b(r, s)irr ,t =

where, depending on the theory in question, these states are actually gso-invariant provided
that r and s satisfy suitable conditions. the normalisation constants have been introduced for
later convenience.

in order to solve the open-closed consistency condition the actual d-brane state is a linear
combination of physical boundary states from dierent sectors. there are two cases to consider,
fractional and truncated d-branes. in the former case, the d-brane state can be written as

|d(r, s)i = nf,u (cid:16)|b(r, s)insns + 1 |b(r, s)irr (cid:17)

+2 nf,t (cid:16)|b(r, s)insns ,t + 1 |b(r, s)irr ,t(cid:17) ,

(a.8)

where i =  determines the sign of the charge with respect to the untwisted and twisted rr
sector charge. the closed string cylinder diagram is then of the form2

here the constant cc is 1 in the nsns sector, zero in the untwisted and twisted rr sector,

2the minus sign in the term proportional to 8,n does not, at rst sight, agree with the conventions of
equation (a.7). however for n = 8 the twisted rr sector does not have any zero modes, and the ground state
is therefore unique; since the orbifold preserves supersymmetry [41], the sign of the gso projection in this case
is then determined by supersymmetry.

a.2 the compactied case

the construction in the compactied case is essentially the same as in the above uncompactied
case; however there are the following dierences.
1. in the localised boundary state (a.3) the integral over compact transverse directions is replaced
by a sum

z dkeik y  xm zz

eim y /r ,

(a.21)

where r is the radius of the compact x direction.
2. in the two untwisted sectors, the ground state is in addition characterised by a winding number
w for each compact direction that is tangential to the world-volume of the brane. the localised
bound state (a.3) then also contains a sum over these winding states

eiw ,

xw

(a.22)

where  is a wilson line; as required by orbifold invariance,   {0, }.
3. for general s, the contribution in the two twisted sectors consists of a sum of terms that are
associated to 2s of the 2n dierent twisted sectors that dene the endpoints of the world-volume
of the brane in the internal space. for convenience we may assume that one of the 2s xed points
is always the origin.

4. the open and closed string hamiltonians, ho and hc, each acquire an extra term 1/4(p w2

).
let us now construct in more detail the boundary state for a fractional d(r, s) brane. this

is of the form

|d(r, s)i = nf,u (cid:16)|b(r, s)insns + 1 |b(r, s)irr (cid:17)

where  labels the dierent xed points between which the brane stretches (where we choose
the convention that t1 is the twisted sector at the origin), and  is the wilson line that is
(thus if  has coordinates
associated to the dierence of the xed point  and the origin.

only the corresponding terms. furthermore, since the projection operator is now 1

b consistency conditions of boundary states

in this appendix we analyse which boundary states are gso- and orbifold invariant. let us rst
consider the condition that comes from gso-invariance.
it is well known that the untwisted
nsns component is invariant under the gso-projection for all (r, s). in the untwisted rr
sector, the gso-projection acts as in the theory before orbifolding, and therefore the boundary
state is only gso-invariant if r + s is even in the case of a type iia orbifold, and odd in the
case of type iib [8].

in the twisted nsns sector there exist fermionic zero modes along the n directions that are

inverted by in, and therefore the condition only aects s. let us introduce

where  takes the n values  = 9  n, . . . , 8 and {

we may choose for convenience

ind = c ,

where  = 1; this is then consistent with (b.6) and (b.8).
if the orbifold does not involve (1)fl, i.e. if it is a g1 orbifold, then the left- and right
gso-projections have to be the same, and thus a gso-invariant combination only exists if
(1)s = +1. in the case of a g2 orbifold the situation is precisely opposite, i.e. a gso-invariant
boundary state exists provided that (1)s = 1. in either case, the gso-invariant boundary
state is then, up to normalisation, given by

|b(r, s)insns ,t = |b(r, s), +insns ,t + |b(r, s),insns ,t .

(b.10)

the analysis in the twisted rr sector is very similar; in this case the fermionic zero modes
occur for  = 1, . . . , 8n, and the condition therefore only involves r. we can similarly introduce
modes 
 that satisfy a cliord algebra, and the boundary states |b(r, s), irr ,t then satisfy

where the sux 0 again denotes the ground state. we can choose the relative normalisation of

as before we may choose for convenience

in d = c ,

where  is again 1. in the case of a g1 orbifold of type iib or a g2 orbifold of type iia, the left-
and right-gso-projections are the same, and therefore a gso-invariant boundary state exists

23

provided that (1)r+1 = +1; similarly a gso-invariant boundary state exists in the other two
cases provided that (1)r+1 = 1; in either case, the boundary state for the twisted rr
sector is then, up to normalisation, given by

|b(r, s)irr ,t = |b(r, s), +irr ,t + |b(r, s),irr ,t.

(b.18)

in summary the following boundary states are thus gso-invariant

for all (r, s),

if r + s is ( even:

|b(r, s)insns
|b(r, s)irr
|b(r, s)insns ,t if (1)s is ( +1: g1-orbifold,
1: g2-orbifold,
if (1)r is ( +1: g1-orbifold of iia or g2-orbifold of iib,
|b(r, s)irr ,t
1: g2-orbifold of iia or g1-orbifold of iib.

iia-orbifold,
iib-orbifold,

odd:

(b.19)

it is reasonable to assume that every theory possesses at least one fractional brane; if we make
this assumption, it follows that  and  must be the same. for example, for the g1 orbifold
of iia, a gso-invariant boundary state exists in all sectors provided that (1)r+s, (1)s and
(1)r are all +1; this requires that  = +1. the other cases are similar. actually, the value of
 is completely determined by this assumption once we consider the conditions that come from
the requirement that the boundary states must also be invariant under the orbifold projection.
again, the boundary state in the untwisted nsns sector is invariant under both g1 or g2, but a
non-trivial condition arises in the untwisted rr sector. indeed, since there are fermionic zero
modes, in acts on the corresponding ground states (that are analogously dened to (b.3) and
(b.11)) as

in|b(r, s), +i0

rr =

rr ,

and similarly

in|b(r, s),i0

rr = in(1)n(n1)/2(1)ns|b(r, s),i0

rr .

in the case of the g1 orbifold, the boundary state is invariant under the orbifold projection
provided that s is even; in the case of a g2 orbifold the condition is that s is odd. if this is to be
consistent with what we found above, we have to choose  =  = +1. incidentally, this is the
convention for which

(b.20)

(b.21)

(b.22)

(b.23)

(1)f (1) f = in ,

on the ground states of the twisted nsns sector.
24

the condition in the twisted sectors is more dicult to analyse since the denition of in in
the twisted sector is a priori ambiguous. the correct prescription seems to be that the physical
states in both twisted sectors have to have eigenvalue +1 (1) with respect to the standard
orbifold projection if the orbifold is of type g = g1 (g = g2).3 this does not give any further
restrictions for the states in the twisted rr sector (since the action of in on the ground states
does not involve any fermionic zero modes), and in the twisted nsns sector, we nd

in|b(r, s), +insns ,t =

y=9n

(2

8

y=9n

(2 

0 )|b(r, s), +insns ,t

= in(1)n(n1)/2(1)ns|b(r, s), +insns ,t ,

and similarly

in|b(r, s),insns ,t = in(1)n(n1)/2(1)s|b(r, s),insns ,t .

(b.24)

(b.25)

(b.26)

thus s has to be even if g = g1, and odd if g = g2; this reproduces precisely the above constraints.
taking everything together, the allowed boundary states are then given as in the main part of
the paper.

c k-theory versus cohomology

as was pointed out in section 4, the lattice of d-brane charges that is described by k-theory is
a sublattice of maximal rank of the (suitably normalised) cohomology lattice. this is something
one may expect on general grounds: k-theory and cohomology are equivalent over the rational
numbers (see for example [42]), and over the integers, they can therefore only dier by a nite
torsion group. in this appendix we shall illustrate this dierence between k-theory and coho-
mology by working out the simplest case, the i2(1)fl orbifold, in detail. we shall also give the
corresponding results for i2 and for the two theories with n = 4.
the k-theory group for the i2(1)fl orbifold is zz6 if r is even (odd) in type iib (iia),
and it is trivial otherwise. the non-trivial elements arise from fractional branes that exist for
s = 1, and truncated branes that exist for s = 0 and s = 2. for xed r, the cohomology charges
can be described by a six-component vector, whose rst two entries correspond to the charge
with respect to the untwisted rr form c (r+2)
1...r+18. the remaining four entries
describe the charge with respect to the four twisted r-r forms. we choose the normalisation so
that the minimal charges are all integer; then a d(r, 0)-brane has charges

1...r+17 and c (r+2)

(c.1)
3this is well known in the case of the orbifold of type iib by i4(1)fl [9] where it follows from considerations

(0, 0;2, 0, 0, 0) ,

of supersymmetry.

25

and the fractional d(r, 1)-branes are described by

(1, 0;1,1, 0, 0),

(0,1;1, 0,1, 0),

(0,1; 0,1, 0,1) ,
where all possible sign combinations are allowed. finally the d(r, 2)-branes have the charges

(1, 0; 0, 0,1,1) ,

(c.2)

where the number of +-signs is even. let us denote by k the lattice that is generated by these
d-branes, and by h the cohomology lattice, i.e. the lattice generated by the basis vectors

(0, 0;1,1,1,1) ,

(c.3)

ei = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) ,

i = 1, . . . , 6 ,

(c.4)

where the 1 is placed in the i-th position. clearly k is a sublattice of h, and they dier by
the nite (torsion) group h/k.

the group h/k is generated by the elements e3, e4 and e5 since

e1 = (1, 0;1,1, 0, 0) + e3 + e4 ,
e2 = (0, 1;1, 0,1, 0) + e3 + e5 ,
e6 = (0, 0; 1, 1, 1, 1)  e3  e4  e5 .

(c.5)
(c.6)
(c.7)

each of these three elements is of order two since 2ei (for i = 3, 4, 5) corresponds to a truncated
d(r,0)-brane and is hence in k. finally, none of the combinations

e3 + e4, e3 + e5, e4 + e5, e3 + e4 + e5

(c.8)

are elements of k, and thus

(c.9)
in the case of the i2 orbifold, the six relevant rr charges are the untwisted rr form
1...r+1 and c (r+3)
c (r+1)
1...r+178, as well as the four twisted rr forms. choosing again the normalisation
of the charges so that every d-brane has integer components, the fractional d(r, 0)-brane is
described by

h/k = zz2  zz2  zz2 .

where all sign choices are allowed, and the 2 can be placed in any of the four last entries. the
d(r, 1)-branes have charges

(1, 0;2, 0, 0, 0) ,

(c.10)

(0, 0;2,2, 0, 0),

(0, 0; 0, 0,2,2),

(0, 0;2, 0,2, 0),

(0, 0; 0,2, 0,2) ,

(c.11)

whilst the fractional d(r, 2)-branes are described by

(0,1;1,1,1,1) .

26

(c.12)

here any combination of signs with an even number of plus signs in the last four entries is allowed.
in this case the group h/k is generated by e3, e4  e3, e5  e3, e6  e3, where e3 is of order four
while each of the other three elements is of order two in h/k. there are no further relations,
and the group is therefore

(c.13)
we have also determined the torsion groups for the two orbifolds with n = 44. for the i4

h/k = zz4  zz2  zz2  zz2 .

orbifold the torsion group is

h/k = zz8  (zz4)5  (zz2)10 ,

while in the case of i4(1)fl the answer is

h/k = (zz4)5  (zz2)10 .
