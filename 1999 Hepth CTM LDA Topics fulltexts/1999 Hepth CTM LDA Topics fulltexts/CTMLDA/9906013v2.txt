abstract

the super 0-brane and gs superstring actions on ads2  s 2 background with 2-
form ux are constructed by supercoset approach. we nd the super 0-brane action

contains two parameters which are interpreted as the electric and magnetic charges of the

super 0-brane. the obtained super 0-brane action describes the bps saturated dyonic
superparticle moving on ads2  s 2 background. the wz action contains the required
coupling with 2-form ux. for gs superstring, we nd the string action on ads2  s 2
takes the same form as those in ads3  s 3 and ads5  s 5 with rr eld background.

1.introduction

recently, motivated by the ads/cft correspondence [1]-[3], there has arisen renewed

interest to study d-brane and string dynamics in curved space. the type iib green-
schwarz (gs) superstring action was constructed in ads5  s 5 background in terms of
supercoset formalism [4]. this action possesses global su(2, 2 | 4) super-invariance, has
-symmetry and 2d reparametrization invariance as its local symmetries, and reduces

to the conventional type iib gs superstring action in the at background limit. the
other related construction for gs superstring, super d3-brane, d1-brane on ads5  s 5,
and super m-branes on ads4  s 7 and ads7  s 4 have been discussed in [5]-[10]. the
gauge-xing of -symmetry was carried out in two dierent approaches: the supersolvable

algebra approach [11] and killing gauge approach [12], and it was shown that the gauge-

xed actions obtained in the two approaches agree through appropriate rearrangement of

elds [13].

even the above studies have made much progress on the understanding to d-brane
and string dynamics in adsp+2  sdp2 background (where p is the dimensions of p-
branes or strings, and d is the spacetime dimensions), the -symmetry gauge-xing and

quantization seem still to pose some diculties [14, 15, 16], then it would be appropriate

to study the d-branes and superstring propagation on some simple ramond-ramond
(rr) backgrounds. one of the simple backgrounds is type iib string on ads3  s 3  m4
(m4 can be chosen as k3 or t 4), which is the near-horizon geometry of type iib d1-
d5 brane conguration [1]. the gs superstring and d-brane actions on ads3  s 3 has
been constructed in [17] and [18]. however, there is a much more simpler background
ads2  s 2  m6 (where m6 is a calabi-yau manifold or k3  t 2 or t 6), which can be
obtained, for example, from the near-horizon geometry of 3  3  3  3 conguration
in type iib string theory [1] . in d=4, n=2 supergravity, the ads2  s 2 background
is the bertotti-robinson (br) solution [19] which is the near-horizon geometry of 3+1

dimensional reissner-nordstrom black hole. therefore, it is quite interesting to see how
p-branes and gs superstring propagate on ads2  s 2 background with 2-form ux.

1

on the other hand, it was shown in [20] that radial motion of a superparticle with

zero angular momentum near the horizon of an extreme reissner-nordstrom black hole
(ads2  s 2) is described by an osp(1 | 2)-invariant superconformal mechanics, and it
was further argued in [20] that the full superparticle dynamics should be invariant under
the larger su(1, 1 | 2) superconformal group because this is the superisometry group of
ads2  s 2. this full dynamics describe not only the radial motion of the superparticle
but also its motion on s 2. in [21], the full su(1, 1 | 2)-invariant action was constructed
from an extension to n=4 superconformal mechanics in the worldline supereld formal-

ism (analogous to the worldline supersymmetry version). then one may ask whether
it is possible to construct the full su(1, 1 | 2)-invariant action in spacetime supersym-
metry version, which possesses local -symmetry and one-dimensional reparametrization

invariance.

due to the above motivations, in this paper we construct super 0-brane and gs super-
string actions on ads2  s 2 background by supercoset approach. the action is built out
of the cartan 1-forms la, la and li. for super 0-brane, we nd the action with two free

parameters a and b (their denition will be given below) where the parameter a can be

explained as the electric charge of the super 0-brane, and b corresponds to its magnetic
charge. and by comparing with the results in [20, 21], we nd that la describes the
radial motion part of the super 0-brane, and la corresponds to its motion on s 2. the
obtained super 0-brane action has global su(1, 1 | 2) super-invariance, and is invariant
under local -symmetry and one-dimensional reparametrization invariance. the expres-

sion for -symmetry includes two parameters a and b. in the present construction, the
mass of super 0-brane is required to be m = (a2 + b2)1/2 by -symmetry, which means
the action, in some sense, describes the bps saturated dyonic superparticle moving on
ads2  s 2 background. especially, the obtained wz action contains the r2 term which
is expected from the conformal mechanics model
[22]. for gs superstring, we nd that
the string action on ads2 s 2 with 2-form ux takes the same form as those in ads3 s 3
and ads5  s 5 with rr eld background.
the layout of the paper is as follows.

in section 2, the structure of superalgebra

su(1, 1 | 2) is presented and the corresponding maurer-cartan equation for the cartan
in section 3, the super 0-brane action on ads2  s 2 is constructed,
1-forms is given.
its -symmetry is veried. some properties of the obtained 0-brane action are discussed.

in section 4, gs superstring action is constructed, and its -symmetry is analysed. in

section 5, we present our summary and discussions.

2. su (1, 1 | 2) superalgebra and maurer-cartan equa-

tion for cartan 1-forms

the algebra of isometry of ads2  s 2 background is given by su(1, 1 | 2) , its bosonic
subalgebra consists of so(1, 2)  so(3). the 4-dimensional gamma matrices and charge
conjugation matrix can be decomposed into 1

a = a  1, a

=   a

, c = c  c 

(1)

where a = 0, 1, a = 2, 3,  = 01, and we have chosen the four-dimensional spinors as
majorana ones. observe that c is antisymmetric, c  is symmetric, so that c is antisym-
metric. the symmetric matrices are ca, cab, c , c a, and the antisymmetric ones are
c, c ab [23]. and we dene 5 = 0123 =   , with  =  2 3. the charge
conjugation c of a spinor  is tc   = 0. the fermionic generators qi are
majorana spinors with  = 1, 2,  = 1, 2, i = 1, 2. then su(1, 1 | 2) supersymmetry
algebra is given by

[pa, pb] = jab
[pa, pb] = jab
[pa, jbc] = abpc  acpb
[pa, jbc] = abpc  acpb
[jab, jcd] = 0

[jab, jcd] = 0

) jab(cid:21) .

(4)

(5)

since a = 0, 1, a = 2, 3, there are only j01, j23 nonzero, we put the right side of

eq.(3) to be zero. note that both sides of eq.(5) are symmetric under the exchange of
of (i)  (j). here we would like to mention that if we choose the decomposion
given by

a = a  , a

= 1  a

, c = c  c 

(6)

instead of (1), the su(1, 1 | 2) supersymmetry algebra takes slightly dierent form to the
above, but they are equivalent.
in the scaling limit pa  rpa, j  j and qi  rqj with r   (r is the radius
of ads2  s 2), the su(1, 1 | 2) superalgebra is reduced to the supersymmetric algebra in
at 4d spacetime.

the left-invariant cartan 1-forms

3. super 0-brane action on ads2  s2
the general structure of the super 0-brane action on ads2  s 2 background in terms

of supercoset formalism can be written as

i0brane = zm2
ldbi = mq(la

ldbi + zm2

lw z

0la

0 + la

0 la
0 )

where m is the mass of super 0-brane, and

la

0 = (

dx m
dt

)la

m , li

0 = (

dx m

dt

)li
m

since lw z is a closed 2-form, we require that

dlw z = 0

(10)

(11)

(12)

since under the action of an arbitrary element of the isometry group the vielbeins
transform as tangent vectors of the stability subgroup, lw z should be invariant of the
subgroup so(1, 1) so(2) in ads 2 s 2 case. the only form for lw z built out of la, la
and li, which can be reduced to at case in the limit r  , is given by2

2we can also add other terms to lw z , but they cannot be reduced properly in at limit, which we

shall discuss below.

with

lw z = h1 + h2

h1 = aij licc   l j + aabla  lb
h2 = bij li(c)(c )   l j + babla

 lb

(13)

(14)

where we have dened 01 = 01 = 1, 23 = 23 = 1. from the maurer-cartan equations,
one nds

dh1 = a lia  li  la + 2a li a  li  la
dh2 = b li(  a)  li  la
where we have used a = abb, a = abb.

+ 2b li(  a)  li  la

to demand dlw z = 0, the only choice is

a = a/2, b = b/2

but no further restriction between a and b, and we have

dh1 = 0, dh2 = 0

then the super 0-brane action on ads2  s 2 can be written as

i0brane = mz dtq(la

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

in (18), there are three parameters m, a and b, where m is the mass of super 0-brane,

the relation among m, a and b will be determined by -symmetry.

when we dene xa  x m la

then the -symmetry transformation can be dened by

(24)
where the expression for -symmetry includes the parameters a and b, and m = a2 + b2
occurs as a consequence of -symmetry of super 0-brane action.

the projection  satises

2 = 1,

tr = 0

(25)

7

then the super 0-brane action on ads2  s 2 can be recast into
(lw z 1 + lw z 2)

i0brane = z dtldbi + zm2

with

(26)

(27)

one can easily check that under the -symmetry transformation (21) with (22) - (24),

i0brane is invariant, i.e.,

kidbi + kiw z = 0

(28)

now we have got the super 0-brane action on ads2  s 2 which is given by (26) and
(27). this action has global su(1, 1 | 2) invariance, and has k-symmetry as well as
one-dimensional reparametrization invariance as its local symmetry.

to see whether the above action can be reduced to the conformal mechanics model

in [22] when we switch o the fermionic part, let us consider the particle of mass m

moving radially on the background of br solution in d=4, n=2 supergravity, which is

given by [24, 25]

2m
ds2 = (
r
2m
a0 = (
r

)

2

4
)

dt2 + (

2m
r

2

)

dr2 + m 2d2

2

(29)

since we only consider radial motion, we can put la

0 = 0, which means we switch o the
potential induced from the motion around s 2. when we ignore the contribution from the

fermionic part, the wz action is reduced to

iw z  zm2

a01l0  l1  zm2

a(

2

)

2m
r

dt  (

2m
r

)dr  z dt

a
r2

(30)

8

which means the wz action contains r2 term that is very crucial ingredient in the

conformal mechanics model

[22].

in [20], the potential is induced by

v = qa0 

q
r2

(31)

where q is the electric charge of the superparticle. by comparing (31) with (30), we nd

that the parameter a can be interpreted as the electric charge of super 0-brane, and

from (24) we can explain the parameter b as the magnetic charge of super 0-brane. then

eq.(24), which relates the mass and charges, shows that the action describes the dynamics
of the bps saturated dyonic superparticle on ads2  s 2 background.

since the non-trivial background elds in ads2 s 2 vacuum are spacetime metric and
rr 2-form ux, the bosonic part of lw z (built out of la, la and li) describes, indeed,
the bosonic couplings of 0-brane to the 2-form ux (that is, the required coupling with

a0 eld). the action of the super 0-brane contains also the fermionic terms required to

make this coupling supersymmetric and -invariant.

from (9), we know under rescaling of r, ldbi, lw z 1 and lw z 2 transform as

ldbi  r1ldbi, lw z 1  r1lw z 1, lw z 2  r2lw z 2

(32)

which shows lw z 2 can be ignored in large r, then in the at-space limit r   the
super 0-brane action is reduced to

i r

0brane = z dt{(a2 + b2)

+aij i j + bij i5 j}

1/2r( xa  iia i)

2

(33)

where a and 5 are gamma matrices of so(1, 3).

here we should mention that when we construct wz action, we could also include

such terms

lw z = h1 + h2 + h

(34)

9

with

h = aij li(c)c   l j + bsij lic(c)   l j

(35)

where sij = (1,1). one can easily check

d h = 0,
 h = 2d[ aij li

0(  1)j + bsij li

0(1  )j ]

(36)

under rescaling of r, h  r1 h, so h can not be ignored in large r comparing with
ldbi and lw z 1. since ,  are the combinations of gamma matrices of so(1, 1), so(2)
respectively, in r   limit h cannot be expressed in the gamma matrices of so(1, 3),
thus the invariance of super 0-brane action under so(1, 3) cannot be recovered in at-
space limit if h was added, so we have to choose a = b = 0 in the above construction.
as we know, the ads2  s 2 conguration can arise as the solution in d=4, n=2 pure
supergravity [24], and in extended case coupling with n vector multiplets [25]. if d=4,

n=2 supergravity model can be obtained from the type iib superstring compactied

on a calabi-yau (cy) threefold (which seem likely in view of the results of [26]), the

above super 0-brane action can be interpreted as the wrapping of d3-brane action on a
supersymmetric cycle c3 of the cy manifold [27]. in type iib superstring theory, d3-
brane couples to self-dual rr 5-forms, which means d3-brane has electric and magnetic
charges. when d3-brane compactied on supersymmetric cycle c3, it turns into 0-brane,
and contains selfdual and antiselfdual 2-forms in 4 dimensions [27]. then the obtained

super 0-brane action should be interpreted as describing bps saturated dyonic superpar-
ticle moving on ads 2  s 2, and the electric and magnetic charges of super 0-brane in 4
dimensions have their origin in 10 dimensions.

4. gs superstring action on ads2  s2
let us consider gs superstring action on ads2 s 2, which is invariant under the local

-symmetry transformation given by

xa = 0,

10

xa

= 0,

i = 2(ala

(ggij) = 16g(p jk

j = i1, p ij

j = i2

(37)

(38)

the gs superstring action on ads2  s 2, which has global su(1, 1 | 2) invariance, should
have the form [4] given by

igs =

with

d2ggij(la

j + la

i la

lw z

lw z = lsij (la  lia  lj + la

 li  a

 lj )

one can check by (8)

dlw z = 0

(39)

(40)

(41)

so lw z is a closed 3-form invariant under so(1, 1) so(2). the variation of lw z takes
the following form, which can be obtained from (19)

lw z = 2lsij d(la  li aj )

(42)

by exploiting (19), (37), (38) and requiring igs = 0, one can determine l = 1, and the
gs superstring action on ads2  s 2 turns into
i la

j + la

1

2z d2ggij(la
igs =

sij[la  lia  lj + la

(43)

since the background which we consider is ads2  s 2 with 2-form ux, the constructed
wz term is unique, and gs superstring action in ads2  s 2 with 2-form ux takes the
same form as those on ads5  s 5 and ads3  s 3 with rr eld.

11

5. summary and discussions

in the above, we have constructed super 0-brane and gs superstring actions on
ads2  s 2 background with 2-form ux by supercoset approach. for super 0-brane,
the action contains two parameters a and b, which can be interpreted as the electric

and magnetic charges of the super 0-brane. the obtained super 0-brane action has
global su(1, 1 | 2) super-invariance, and is invariant under local -symmetry and one-
dimensional reparametrization invariance. the mass of super 0-brane is required to be
m = (a2 + b2)1/2 by -symmetry, which indicates that the action describes the bps
saturated dyonic superparticle moving on ads2  s 2 background with 2-form ux. also
the bosonic part of the wz action contains the bosonic couplings of 0-brane to the 2-form

ux background, which is crucial ingredient in the conformal mechanics model [22]. for
gs superstring, we nd that the string action on ads2  s 2 with 2-form ux takes the
same form as those in ads3  s 3 and ads5  s 5 with rr eld background.

by the supercoset approach, we can nd the closed form expression for the superviel-
bein by solving the maurer-cartan equation (for ads5  s 5, such an expression has been
found in [5]). in [14], it was shown that the supersolvable algebra gauge and the killing
spinor gauge for xing the -symmetry of brane actions in adsp+2  sdp2 backgrounds
are incompatible with supersymmetric static solutions of worldvolume brane equations of

motion, then it is interesting to see how to do gauge-xing of -symmetry properly for
super 0-brane action on ads2  s 2, which would shed light on the similar problems on
other complicated backgrounds.

if we consider a restriction on the full dynamics in which the particle is assumed

to move within an equatorial plane (this restriction corresponds to a reduction of the
superconformal symmetry to the subgroup of su(1, 1 | 2): su(1, 1 | 2)  su(1, 1 | 1) =
osp(2 | 2)), it would be interesting to study how to reduce our model to that in [28], from
which we could draw some lessons on the quantization of super 0-brane on ads2  s 2.
it was argued that the large n-particle su(1, 1 | 2) superconformal calogero model
would provide a microscopic description of the extremal rn black hole (at least near the

12

horizon) [29]. then we expect that the n-particle su(1, 1 | 2) superconformal calogero
model will probably give us some hints on the non-abelian generalization of the abelian

0-brane action that we have found. we hope to return those issues in near future.
