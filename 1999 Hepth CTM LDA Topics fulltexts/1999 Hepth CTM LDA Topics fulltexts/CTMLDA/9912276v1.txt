four-dimensional planck scale is not

universal in fifth dimension in

randall-sundrum scenario

abstract

it has recently been proposed that the hierarchy problem can be solved
by considering the warped fth dimension compactied on s1/z2. many
attempts in this scenario assume a particular choice for an integration constant
0 that appears when one solves the ve-dimensional einstein equation. since
0 is not determined by the boundary condition of the ve-dimensional theory,
0 may be regarded as a gauge degree of freedom in a sense. so far the
four-dimensional planck mass apparently depends on 0. in this paper, we
carefully discuss this issue of the integration constant 0, and present the
0-independent relation between the four-dimensional planck mass mpl and
ve-dimensional fundamental mass scale m . as a result, planck mass takes
dierent value on the brane at each boundary, and remarkably enough, we
can take m to tev region when we consider the models with standard model
conned on the distant brane. we also check that the physical masses on
the distant brane do not depend on 0 by taking a bulk scalar eld as an
illustrative example. the resulting mass scale of the kaluza-klein modes is
of the order of m .

1 introduction

a vast gap between the electroweak scale and the planck scale, known as the hi-
erarchy problem, remains as a major mystery in particle physics. recently, it has
been suggested that large compactied extra dimensions may provide a solution to
the hierarchy problem [1]. the relation between the four-dimensional planck scale
mpl and higher dimensional scale m is given by mpl = m n+2vn, where vn is the
volume of the extra compactied dimensions. if vn is large enough, m can be of
the order o(tev). unfortunately, this scenario alone does not completely solve the
problem. the original hierarchy is translated into another hierarchy between m and
the compactication scale rc = v 1/n

.

n

in ref.[2], randall and sundrum (rs) proposed an alternative scenario based
on an extra dimension compactied on s1/z2 with three-branes located at two
boundaries. standard model elds are assumed to be conned on the distant three-
brane, while gravitons propagate in the ve-dimensional bulk. the background
metric takes the form

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn = e2(y)dxdx + dy2,

(1)

where xm = (x, y) is the coordinate of the ve-dimensional spacetime. the function
(y) is found by solving the ve-dimensional einstein equation to be

(y) = k|y| + 0,

(2)

where k is the curvature scale related to the ve-dimensional cosmological constant
. it was then shown that the eective planck mass in four dimensions is given by
the formula

m 2

pl =

m 3
k

(1  e2krc)e20,

(3)

where rc is the radius of the fth dimension.

two things are to be noticed. the rst point is that according to the above
formula (3), the four-dimensional planck mass is universal ; it takes the same
value on both branes located at dierent boundaries. on the other hand, it was
argued that mass scales on the distant brane located at y = rc are rescaled by a
warp factor ekrc . it is this dierence that generates the hierarchy

the second point to be noticed is that the formula (3) apparently contains the
integration constant 0, which is left undetermined by the boundary condition of the
ve-dimensional theory. moreover, a certain kind of symmetry under the exchange
of two boundaries is not manifest in this formula (3), as was pointed out in ref.[4].
in this paper, we argue that these two points are intimately related to each
other. we carefully discuss the issue of 0 and point out that the value of the
four-dimensional planck mass diers from hidden to visible, that is, non-universal.
this paper is organized as follows. after a review of the rs model in section 2,
we present our formula for planck mass in section 3. in section 4, we apply our
prescription for a bulk scalar eld for example and examine masses of kaluza-klein
(kk) modes of it [5]. we show that their masses are also independent of 0. as a
result, in k > 0 scenario, we can adjust m to tev region by identifying planck mass
on the distant brane as 1018 gev, and nd that mass of the kk modes of the order
of m. section 5 is devoted to our conclusion and discussion.

2 rs model

first, we review the derivation of the four-dimensional planck mass in the scenario
of ref.[2].

the background metric of the model takes the form

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn = e2(y)dxdx + dy2,

(5)

where xm = (x, y) is the coordinate of the ve-dimensional spacetime, and the fth
dimension is compactied on s1/z2 with the radius rc. the fundamental region of
the fth dimension is given by 0  y  rc. a set of three-branes are located at
each xed point y = yi of s1/z2. the brane at y0 = 0 is called hidden brane and
the brane at y1 = rc visible. here and hereafter, we use the subscripts i = 0, 1 for
quantities at y = 0, rc, respectively.

the action is

s = sgravity + sbrane,

sgravity = z d4xz rc
sbrane = xi=0,1z d4xqg(i)nl(i)  v(i)o ,

dygn + 2m 3ro ,

rc

(6)

where g(i)
brane tensions v(i) is subtracted from the three-brane lagrangians.

(x) = g(x, y = yi) is the induced metric on the i-th brane, and the

with the metric (5), the ve-dimensional einstein equation reduces to two dif-

ferential equations for (y); by denoting  = y,

((y))2 = 
24m 3 ,
(y) = xi=0,1

v(i)
24m 3 (y  yi).

the solution to the rst equation (7) is given by

with

(y) = k|y| + 0

k = s 
24m 3 .

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

here, 0 is the integration constant which is not determined by the boundary con-
dition of the ve-dimensional theory. conventionally this integration constant 0
is omitted by saying that it just amounts to an overall constant rescaling of x.
irrespectively of the value of 0, the consistency of the solution (9) with the second
equation (8) requires that the brane tensions and bulk cosmological constant are
related by

k =

v(0)
24m 3 = 

v(1)
24m 3 .

(11)

according to ref [2], we consider a uctuation h from minkowski spacetime

metric , and replace  by a four-dimensional metric g =  + h. then,

sef f = z d4xz rc

rc

dy 2m 3e2(y)gr(g) +   

 2m 2

plz d4xgr(g) +    ,

(12)

the integration constant 0 might be determined by the fundamental theory in higher dimen-

sions [6].

3

where r(g) denotes the four-dimensional scalar curvature constructed from g.
this gives the formula (3) for the universal four-dimensional planck mass

m 2

pl =

m 3
k

(1  e2krc)e20.

(13)

we stress that this expression for planck mass depends on the integration constant
0. if one takes a choice 0 = 0 as in ref.[2], then the above expression reduces to

m 2

pl =

m 3
k

(1  e2krc).

(14)

with this choice, one is forced to take m to be of the order of mpl  1018 gev
when one consider k > 0.
as was pointed out in ref.[4], we are free to choose the y-independent constant 0
in eq.(9). a particular choice 0 = krc/2 was made so as to meet the requirement
that the expression for mpl is manifestly invariant for the changing k  k, which
amounts to exchanging the role of two boundaries. then, the four-dimensional
planck mass is written as

m 2

pl =

2m 3

k

sinh(2krc).

(15)

as was already noted in ref.[4], however, it is bound to be the truth that the
change of 0 has no net physical eect and must not change the values of four-
dimensional physical quantities. therefore the physical quantities should have the
above exchanging-symmetry without choosing 0. in other words, physical quantities
including planck mass should have the following two properties. first, they are
independent of 0. second, they are not aected by the above brane-exchanging.

in the subsequent section, we will present such a prescription that naturally

realizes these two properties.

3 four-dimensional eective planck mass

as stated previously, a choice of 0 has no net physical eect, and must not change
the values of physical quantities. that is, all the physical quantities, including
planck mass, must be independent of 0. in this sense 0 may be regarded as a gauge

we follow the normalizaton of ref.[2].

degree of freedom. in particular, the 0-independence of the four-dimensional planck
mass may be understood by the following argument. observe that 0 determines
the relative ratio of the length scales between the fth-dimensional direction and
four-dimensional one at y = 0. therefore, after we have integrated over the full fth
dimension when calculating mpl, the freedom of this relative ratio will be invisible
in the eective theory.

to nd the four-dimensional planck mass more carefully, we consider in which
location y the four-dimensional planck mass is measured. since the positions of
the branes are y = yi in the fth dimension, the metric along the i-th brane is
ds2 = e2idxdx. this metric becomes the minkowski one  by choosing the
coordinates x
i . in this way,
we are led to consider the eective theory on the i-th brane by using the coordinate
x
i = eix on it. as a result, the values of planck mass are dierent brane to
brane.

i = eix on the i-th brane, that is, ds2 = dx

i dx

let us recapitulate this in some dierent way. generally the induced metric on

the i-th brane is given by

g(i)
 (i) =

xm

i

xn

i

gm n (x = x (i) , y = yi) ,

(16)

where 
is the coordinates on the i-th brane, and x = x(i), y = yi determines
i
the embedding of this brane into ve-dimensional spacetime. if one choose x = 
i
as was implicitly done in ref.[2], the induced metric (16) becomes

g(i)
(i) = g (x = x(i), y = yi) = e2i.

(17)

on the other hand, we proposed to choose x = ei
reduces to the minkowski one ;

i so that the induced metric

from now on, we denote the i-th brane coordinate 

g(i)
 (i) = e2ig (x = x(i), y = yi) = .
i by x

i = eix.

let us make the above observation concrete. in the expression

sef f = z d4xz rc

rc

dy 2m 3e2(y)gr(g; x) +    ,

we change the integration variables as x = eix

i . we then obtain

sef f = z d4xiz rc

rc

dy 2m 3e2((y)i )gr(g; xi) +   

 2m 2

pl(i)z d4xigr(g; xi) +    ,

(18)

(19)

(20)

5

where i = (yi), and r(g; xi) denotes the four-dimensional scalar curvature con-
structed from the metric g with the coordinate x

i . it follows

m 2

pl(i) = z rc

rc

dym 3e2((y)i )

= m 3e2(i0)z rc

rc

dye2k|y|

=

m 3
k

(1  e2krc)e2(i0).

(21)

with this expression (21), mpl(i) is clearly independent of 0. explicitly, we nd

on the brane at y = 0 and

m 2

pl(0) =

m 3
k

(1  e2krc)

m 2

pl(1) =

m 3
k

(e2krc  1)

(22)

(23)

on the brane y = rc. note that these expressions go into each other by replacing
k with k. thus our results naturally satisfy two properties stated in the previous
section.
the most important aspect of the rs model is that it gives rise to a localized
graviton eld [3]. our results (22) and (23) can naturally be understood from this
fact; the small planck scale mpl(0) arises because of the localized graviton in the fth
dimension near the brane of a positive tension while the large planck scale mpl(1)
arises because of the small overlap of the graviton with the brane of a negative
tension.

eliminating m, we obtain

mpl(1) = ekrcmpl(0).

(24)

this is an example of the general rule. from the metric (5), the length scale l(i) on
the i-th brane and lbulk in the bulk are always related by l(i) = eilbulk. in terms
of the mass scale, m(i) = eim. therefore, the scales on two branes are related by

m(1) = ekrcm(0).

(25)

to be precise, mp1(1) should be identied as the planck scale in models with standard model
conned on the brane at y = rc, and mpl(0) should be identied as that in models with sm at
y = 0. in any case, we have only one planck scale in a given model.

6

this exponential factor determines the natural relation between mass scales on two
branes.

now, we consider the scenario of ref.[2] where standard model elds are assumed
to be conned on the brane at y = rc with a negative tension. we also take k > 0
for deniteness. then, according to our prescription, the planck scale is

m 2

pl(1) 

m 3
k

e2krc.

(26)

we see that the fundamental mass scale m becomes much smaller than the planck
scale, unlike the original proposal [2]. as a result, it is perfectly possible that the
fundamental scale m lies in tev region.

4 physical mass scale

in order to check from another viewpoint that the physical quantities are inde-
pendent of 0, we take a massless bulk scalar eld as an illustrative example, and
examine the masses of the kk modes. extensions to a massive bulk scalar eld and
a bulk gauge eld are straightforward.

the action is given by

sscalar = 
1

=

1

2 z d5xggm n m n 
2 z d5xe2( + e2ye4y),

where   . the kk modes expansion is

(x, y) = xn0

n(x)n(y),

where the mode functions n(y) are chosen to satisfy

d

dy  e4 d

dy! n(y) = m 2

ne2n(y)

(27)

(28)

(29)

with mass eigenvalues mn. the solutions to this equation are related to bessel
functions j2 and y2 of order two [5]. we should be careful with eq.(29) however,
since it still contains 0. as the orthnormality condition for n, let us take

z rc

rc

dye2mn = mne2i.

(30)

7

then we have

sscalar =

1

2 xn0z d4xn(  m 2

n)n .

(31)

in our point of view the action should be described by using the i-th brane
coordinate x
i = eix. then, the four-dimensional volume element d4x and the
dierential operator  are replaced by d4xi = d4xe4i and i = e2i, respectively;

sscalar =

1

2 xn0z d4xi 

n(cid:16)i  e2im 2

n(cid:17) 

n .

(32)

we nd that canonically-normalized elds in four-dimensions are 
and the physical masses of the kk modes are given by

n(xi) = n(x),

to clarify the physical meaning of this (33), let us rewrite the equation (29) into

m 2

n(i)  e2im 2

n(i) .

(33)

d

dy  e4ky d

dy! n = (cid:16)m 2

ne20(cid:17) e2kyn  m2

ne2kyn .

(34)

n regarded as an eigenvalue, this equation is independent of 0. this implies
n depends on the parameters k and rc, but not on 0; m2
n(k, rc).

with m2
that m2
therefore the 0-dependence cancels out in eq.(33) as
n(i) = mnei = mne(i0) .

n = m2

(35)

m 

the mass spectrum of the kk modes is determined by the boundary condition
(d/dy) n (y = rc) = 0. in particular, we are interested in the mass
n(1) as measured on the visible brane. to this end, notice that eq.(34) is

at y = rc,
scale m 
precisely the same equation that was treated in ref.[5], where it was shown that

therefore the mass scale of the kk modes is estimated to

mn  kekrc = ke(10).

m 

n(1)  k  m  mpl(1) .

(36)

(37)

we thus conrm that the mass scale of the kk modes is signicantly smaller than
the planck scale  1018 gev. we remark, however, that our interpretations is quite
dierent from the usual one ;

mn  k  m  mpl .

(38)

5 conclusions

the most important point in our treatment is to make the brane coordinate trans-
formation, by which the induced metric on each brane becomes minkowski metric
. when measured with such brane coordinates, the four-dimensional planck mass
becomes dierent on each brane. we found that the four-dimensional planck mass,
when calculated by this procedure, does not depend on the integration constant 0.
we showed that the masses of the kk modes are also independent of 0 in a massless
bulk scalar. this holds for any kinds of elds. moreover the exchanging-symmetry
is manifest in our expression for the planck masses. on the brane with a negative
tension, the planck mass is always much larger than on the brane with a positive ten-
sion. this fact is interpreted as the smallness of the gravitational coupling constant,
that is, the small overlap of the graviton with the former brane. when we identify
the brane of a negative tension with the visible brane, the fundamental scale m can
be signicantly smaller than the planck mass, and the masses of the kk modes are
of the same order as m in the massless bulk scalar. we can summarize the above
statement as follows. when we estimate the values of physical quantities, we must
multiply the warp factor corresponding to their mass dimension to the values in the
bulk. this rule is not exceptional to the planck mass.

the most striking result is that the fundamental scale m in the ve-dimensional
theory can be signicantly smaller than that was supposed so far.
it can lie in
tev region for instance. given this, it will be interesting to nd a direct evidence
for the extra dimension in randall-sundrum type scenario. high-energy accelerator
experiments in near future might directly prove the existence of the extra dimension.
