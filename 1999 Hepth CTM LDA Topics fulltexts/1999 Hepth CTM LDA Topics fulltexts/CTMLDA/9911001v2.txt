quantum mechanics on the moduli space of n supersymmetric reissner-nordstrom

black holes is shown to admit 4 supersymmetries using an unconventional supermulti-

plet which contains 3n bosons and 4n fermions. a near-horizon limit is found in which

the quantum mechanics of widely separated black holes decouples from that of strongly-

interacting, near-coincident black holes. this near-horizon theory is shown to have an

enhanced d(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry. the bosonic symmetries are sl(2, r) con-
formal symmetry and su (2)  su (2) r-symmetry arising from spatial rotations and the
r-symmetry of n = 2 supergravity.

1. introduction

the quantum mechanics of n slowly-moving, four-dimensional extremal reissner-

nordstrom black holes is a sigma model whose target space is the moduli space of multi-

black hole solutions. this moduli space is parameterized by the 3n coordinates of the n
black holes in r3. the metric on this moduli space was discovered over a decade ago by
ferrell and eardley [1,2]. when embedded in n = 2 supergravity, the static black hole
congurations preserve four of the eight supersymmetries. one therefore expects an n = 4
supersymmetric quantum mechanics with 4n fermions arising as goldstinos. typically four

supersymmetries would imply a complex structure on the target space. this is clearly not

possible in this instance, however, because the dimension of the moduli space can be odd.

this puzzle is discussed in [3-5]. aspects of this problem are explored in [6-8].

in this paper we resolve this puzzle by coupling 3n real n = 1 supermultiplets ,
containing one fermion and one boson apiece, to n real fermionic n = 1 supermultiplets
a, each containing one physical fermion and an auxiliary boson. this gives the required

3n bosons and 4n fermions. we show that taken together these comprise a constrained
n = 4 multiplet, which is then used to construct a general class of n = 4 actions. the
geometry of such theories is a generalization of the weak hyperkahler with torsion geometry
[4] to 3n dimensions, in which the su (2) generators of r3 spatial rotations play the role

of the triplet of complex structures. the ferrell-eardley moduli space is shown to be an

1

example of such a geometry and therefore admits n = 4 supersymmetry, although we will
see that the moduli space metric is modied when the auxiliary bosons are integrated out.

supersymmetry therefore requires corrections to the ferrell-eardley metric.

we further consider a near-coincident or near-horizon limit of the moduli space in

which the coordinate separation (in spatially conformal coordinates) of the center of mass

of the black holes is small compared to their size. in this limit the actual geodesic distance

between horizons remains innite and all curvatures remain small, so the semiclassical ap-

proximation is expected to be valid. at low energies this near-horizon quantum mechanics

completely decouples from quantum mechanics of widely-separated black holes. we show

that the near-horizon theory has an enhanced d(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry. one of

the bosonic su (2) subgroups of d(2, 1; 0) arises from spacetime rotations, while the other
arises form the r-symmetry of n = 2 supergravity in four dimensions.

one motivation for this work is to understand the spectrum of black hole bound states.

the wave function for any state of the near-horizon theory has coordinate separations

between black holes which are small compared to their size. such states are therefore

multi-black hole bound states. we expect that the d(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry

will play a key role in understanding the bound state spectrum.

in section 2 we describe the moduli space and its near-horizon limit.

in section 3
we construct the n = 4 supersymmetric extension. in section 4 we describe d(2, 1; )
superconformal quantum mechanics. in section 5 we show that the near-horizon theory

has d(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry. related work in ve dimensions appears in [9-

12]. related work on supersymmetric and superconformal quantum mechanics appears in

[3,4,13-16]. some aspects of sections 3 and 4 have been investigated independently by g.

papadopoulos [17].

2. the multi-black hole moduli space

we wish to study the moduli space of extremal black hole solutions of pure n = 2
supergravity in four dimensions. to this end we will rst review results for the moduli

space of black hole solutions in einstein-maxwell theory, which is the bosonic sector of the

supergravity theory under consideration.

2

2.1. the moduli space metric

the study of black hole moduli spaces was pioneered by ferrell and eardley [1], who

considered extremally charged black holes in four-dimensional einstein-maxwell theory,

(2.1)

which has the action

sem =

1

16 z d4xg(r  f 2).

this theory admits static multi-black hole solutions whose metric and potential are given

by

ds2 = 2dt2 + 2dx2,

a = (1  1)dt

in terms of a harmonic function

(x) = 1 +xa

ma

|x  xa|

,

(2.2)

(2.3)

where a = 1, . . . , n labels the n black holes with masses ma and positions xa. the
einstein-maxwell action evaluated for solution (2.2)

is independent of xa, thus the positions of the black holes are moduli. this is the well

l0 = xa

ma

(2.4)

known fact that the electric repulsion and gravitational attraction of extremal black holes
cancel. if one gives the black holes small velocities va and expands the einstein-maxwell
action to o(v2) around the static solution (2.2) one nds ferrell and eardleys eective
lagrangian [1]

(2.5)

(2.6)

l =

ma(va)2 + lint,

where

ra = x  xa and ra = |ra|. it is a curious (and unexplained) fact that (2.6) contains
only two-body, three-body and four-body interactions. a very useful form of the eective

lagrangian (2.5) is

l =

16 z d3x 4,

(2.7)

with  given by (2.3) and spatial indices i, j = 1, 2, 3.

3

2.2. the near-horizon limit

let us rst consider the single black hole solutions of einstein-maxwell theory. for
1| . the

an extremal black hole at x1 the metric takes the form (2.2) where (x) = 1 + m
|xx
near-horizon limit is dened by |x  x1|  1, in which case the metric takes the form

m(cid:17)2
ds2 = (cid:16) r

r (cid:17)2
dt2 +(cid:16) m

dr2 + m2d2

(2.8)

where r = |x  x1|. thus the near-horizon geometry of a single extremal black hole is
ads2  s2.

this analysis of the near-horizon limit of the physical geometry motivates the de-

nition of a similar limit for the multi-black hole moduli space geometry. we require that
|xa  xb|  1 for a, b = 1, . . . , n . in this limit the 1 in the harmonic function  can be
dropped and the potential in (2.7) is replaced by

l = 

1

16 z d3x "xa

ma

|x  xa|#4

.

(2.9)

the geometry of the moduli space is still quite complicated. an important feature of this
geometry is the existence of noncompact, asymptotically locally at regions for xa  xb.
these correspond to near-coincident black holes.

3. n = 4 supersymmetry and the black hole moduli space

in this section we demonstrate that (2.7) admits an n = 4 supersymmetric extension.
such an extension is expected because the solution (2.2) preserves four supersymmetries
when embedded in n = 2, d = 4 supergravity. the four broken supersymmetries are
expected to lead to four goldstinos per black hole, and hence 4n fermions in addition

to the 3n bosons in the supersymmetric quantum mechanics. since the unbroken super-

charges transform under spatial rotations, we further expect an su (2) r symmetry with

the bosons in triplets and the fermions in doublets. a second su (2) quantum mechanical

r-symmetry, with singlet bosons and doublet fermions, is expected from reduction of the

four-dimensional r-symmetry.

this eld content sounds rather exotic as one usually encounters equal numbers of

bosons and fermions in a supersymmetric theory. however in one dimension there is a

fermion supermultiplet  whose only physical elds are fermions [18]. accordingly in this

4

section we consider 3n real n = 1 multiplets   each of which contains one boson
and one fermion  along with n extra fermion multiplets a  each of which contains
a single physical fermion. these are combined into a constrained n = 4 multiplet in a
manner which properly realizes the r-symmetries. invariant actions are then constructed
using n = 4 superspace. this construction is found to include the black hole quantum
mechanics as a special case.

3.1. supersymmetry transformations

our treatment of supersymmetry follows closely that of coles and papadopoulos [18],

although our notation diers very slightly. we rst introduce the n = 1 superelds

 = x   i,

a = ia + iba,

(3.1)

where x  and ba are real bosons and  and a are real fermions. the bosonic supereld
 is the usual map from n = 1 superspace into the sigma model manifold m. we dene
the usual superspace derivatives for the 0th supersymmetry

which obey

q =

d =

q2 = i

{q, d} = 0.

appear in appendix a of [18] (and in much more generality than our special case). the

most interesting constraints are

(3.7)

for all i, where n (ii) is the nijenhuis tensor of ii.

if the ei terms are absent (3.7) requires the ii to be complex structures. this is

impossible, however, if the target space is 3n dimensional as in the case of current interest.

a simple solution of the constraints when  = 1, . . . , 3n and a = 1, . . . , n is

(3.8)

where we have replaced the index  with the index pair ai with i = 1, 2, 3. it is easy to

check directly that the closure conditions (3.6) are satised by (3.8).

3.2. supersymmetric actions

in order to construct supersymmetric actions it is ecient to introduce constrained
n = 4 superelds. we employ anticommuting superspace coordinates r, r = 0, . . . , 3,
where 0   is the usual n = 1 superspace coordinate. the corresponding n = 4 super-
elds are denoted in boldface (t, r) and a(t, r). their i-independent components
are the usual n = 1 superelds (t, ) and a(t, ) appearing in (3.1). we dene

qr =

d
dr

+ ir

d
dt

,

dr =

d
dr  ir

d
dt

which obey

{qr, qs} = 2irs

d
dt

= {dr, ds},

{qr, ds} = 0,

(3.9)

(3.10)

with d0  d. the supersymmetry transformations in n = 4 superspace are generated by
the qr,

  =  rqr,

 a =  rqra,

(3.11)

which automatically obey the supersymmetry algebra. the n = 4 superelds have many
fermionic components which we need to reduce in number by a constraint. at the same

time we wish to recover the transformations (3.4). both of these goals are accomplished

by the constraint

j

kdak + j

diaj = i
dia = iij aj.

i a

(3.12)

one recovers (3.4) by plugging these constraints into the i-independent part of (3.11).

a manifestly n = 4 supersymmetric action can now be constructed as

s =

1

2z dtd4 l().

6

(3.13)

this can be reduced to an n = 1 superspace action using the constraints (3.12) and
integrating over the three i. using r dif = dif|i=0 + (total derivative) we nd that

s =

1

2z dtd hl,d1d2d3

+ l, (d1d2d3 + d2d3d1 + d3d1d2)
+ l,d1d2d3ii=0

(3.14)

where , ,  = 1, . . . , 3n run over the moduli space indices aj. from (3.12) we see that
for k 6= i

dkdiaj = didkaj = i

j

kda  2im[ki]

j am,

(3.15)

d1d2d3 = id .

(3.16)

we may write the action in a more symmetric form by anticommuting and integrating the

third line of (3.14) by parts:

s =

1

2z dtd (cid:20) 1

3!

l,ijkdidj dk

+ l,( 1

2 ijkdidjdk + id  )(cid:21)i=0

.

(3.17)

the most general supersymmetric action for  and a contains the terms [18]

(3.18)

using (3.12) and (3.15) we can read o the quadratic terms of (3.17),

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

the actions (3.13) and (3.18) are n = 4 supersymmetric for any function l. compar-
ing the bosonic metric (3.19) appearing in the action with the moduli space metric (2.7)

we conclude that the choice

l = 

1

16 z d3x 4

(3.26)

describes the n = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics of n black holes.

it is straightforward to check that with l given by (3.26), the coupling fa computed

from (3.21) is nonzero (as long as n > 2). from (3.18) it can be seen that this implies a
coupling of the form fa x ba once the superelds are written out in terms of components.
when the auxiliary elds ba are integrated out, the quadratic action g x  x  will receive
an additional contribution proportional to fafbhab x  x . this signies a modication
of the moduli space metric required by supersymmetry.

4. superconformal symmetry with fermion multiplets

in this section we investigate the superconformal extension of the supersymmetry al-
gebra developed in the previous section. we continue to work with the multiplets (x , )
and (a, ba). in sections 4.1 and 4.2 we will work with generic ii and ei, requiring only that
the extra supersymmetries (3.4) satisfy the supersymmetry algebra (3.6)  we will restrict

our attention to the specic choices of ii and ei (3.8) only in section 4.3. although our

approach will resemble that of [9] we will work entirely in the lagrangian formulation. one

consequence of this is that we will investigate separately the closure of the superconformal
algebra on the elds (x , , a, ba) and invariance of the action (3.14).

4.1. conformal transformations

we investigate the behavior of the elds (x , , a, ba) under conformal transfor-

mations. it is convenient to parametrize a conformal transformation by

(t) = h + 2td + t2k .

(4.1)

8

where h , d, and k are constant innitesimal parameters corresponding respectively

to time translations, dilatations and special conformal transformations. with this

parametrization the sl(2, r) algebra takes the form

[1 , 2 ] = [1,2],

where [1, 2] = 1 2  2 1.

(4.2)

if we dene the generators h, d and k by

h = ih h,

2d t = idd,

k t2 = ik k,

(4.3)

then the algebra takes the familiar form

[h, k] = id,

[h, d] = 2ih,

[k, d] = 2ik.

(4.4)

the variation of the eld x  under a conformal transformation is

x  =  x  + 1

2 d

(4.5)

for some vector eld d(x). one easily checks that the sl(2, r) algebra (4.2) is satised
for any d. for the remaining elds, we make the ansatze1

 =   + 1
a =  a + 1
ba = ba + 1

2 f ,
2 ga,
2 h a.

(4.6)

again one easily checks that the sl(2, r) algebra is satised as long as f (x, ), ga(x, )
and h a(x, b) do not depend on the time derivatives of the four basic elds.

we now wish to enlarge the algebra to include the supersymmetries (3.2) and (3.4). in

analogy with the above discussion we will express the supersymmetry variations in terms
of generators qr of supersymmetry transformations on the component elds (not to be

confused with the superderivatives (3.9), which act on superelds) dened by

 = irqr

(4.7)

1 although we shall not nd it necessary, one could consider more general conformal transfor-
mations where d, f , ga and h a are functions of (x , , a, ba). in this case the conditions
required by closure of the osp(1|2)r algebras become somewhat more complicated.

9

where the r are anticommuting parameters. since the supersymmetry transformations do
not involve the index a we will suppress this index and consider just the elds (x i, i, , b).

the action of these generators on the component elds is

q0x i = i,

q0i = i x i,

q0 = ib,

q0b =  

(4.8)

and

qix j = ij
qij = iij

kk + ij ,
k x k  iij b,

qi = i x i,
qib =  i.

(4.9)

it is straightforward to verify that these generators obey the required anticommutation
relations {qr, qs} = 2rsh.

we rst enlarge the sl(2, r) algebra to osp(1|2)0 by incorporating the n = 1 super-
symmetry transformation q0. following the procedure outlined in appendix a we dene
the superconformal generator s0 by the relation [k, q0] = is0. the requirement that
[d, q0] = iq0 on x  implies the unique choice f  = q0(x   d). this same relation on
a requires h a = iq0(ga a). the relation [k, s0] = 0 gives no additional constraints,
so the remaining (anti-) commutation relations of osp(1|2)0 (see appendix b) follow with
no additional restrictions on d(x) or ga(x, ).

the next step is to incorporate the extended supersymmetries (4.9). we rst examine
the conditions required by closure of the osp(1|2)i subalgebra, which is generated by
(h, d, k, qi, si), for each value of i. we dene si by [k, qi] = isi as before. we nd

[d, qi]x  = iqix  + i(ldi i

)  a(ldei

a + ei

a)  ei

aga.

(4.10)

so that closure of the algebra requires ldii
that (ld  )ei



a = 0 for some constant  then (4.10) requires



 = 0. furthermore, if we make the ansatz

ga = ( + 1)a.

[d, qi]a = iqia + x (ld + )ei

a



acting on a we nd

so we must have

a

 = 0.

(ld + )ei
10

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

the rest of the osp(1|2)i algebra follows without further restrictions.

we have veried that the supersymmetry transformations (3.2) and (3.4) together

with the conformal transformations

x  =  x  + 1
 =   + 1
a =  a  1
ba = ba  1

2 d,
2 (d
2 ( + 1)a,
2 ( + 2)ba

,  ),

(4.14)

satisfy the n separate algebras osp(1|2)r as long as



 = (ld  )ei



a = (ld + )ei

a

 = 0

(4.15)

ldii
for each i = 1, . . . ,n  1.

we must now knit these n osp(1|2)r algebras together into the appropriate superal-
gebra. following the procedure outlined in appendix a, it remains only to check that the
qr lie in an appropriate spinor representation of the r symmetry algebra which appears
on the right-hand side of the {qr, ss} anticommutator. this will be done for the constant
i and e case (3.8) in section 4.3 below.

4.2. conformally invariant n = 1 actions

in this section we construct conformally invariant actions out of the n = 1 multiplets
 and a. let us start with the supereld . the most general action involving only

dimensionless couplings is [18]

(4.17)

where

(4.18)

it is convenient to consider separately the bosonic and fermionic terms in (4.17). using

dilatations requires

i.e. that d is a homothety. invariance under special conformal transformations requires

(ld  2)g = 0,

(4.20)

in addition that

d = k

(4.21)

for some function k. a vector eld d obeying (4.20) and (4.21) is known as a closed

homothety. note that in general invariance of the action under dilatations does not guar-

antee invariance under the full conformal group.

in all further calculations we assume

(4.20) and (4.21) hold. for the two-fermion terms in (4.17) we nd

2 g dt + i

(cid:16) i

2 c x (cid:17) 

i
4

[(ld  2)c] x  +

i
4

dc 

(4.22)

so invariance requires that

(ld  2)c = 0,

dc = 0.

(4.23)

again, the rst condition is required by dilatation invariance and the second is an additional

constraint required for full conformal symmetry. finally, varying the four-fermion terms

in (4.17) gives

(cid:0) 1

6 c, (cid:1) 

1
12

[(ld  2)c] ,

(4.24)

which vanishes as consequence of (4.23), giving no further constraints. the conditions

(4.20), (4.21) and (4.23) agree precisely with those found by the authors of [9], who used

the hamiltonian formalism.

when the fermion multiplet a = ia + iba is included there are ve additional

terms that one can add to the superspace lagrangian (4.16),

l2 =

(4.25)

the calculation of l2 is similar to the above calculation, so we will simply quote the
result. the terms (4.25) are dilatation invariant provided that

ldhab = (2 + 2)hab,
ldlabc = (3 + 2)labc ,
ldfa = ( + 2)fa,

ldmab = (2 + 2)mab,
ldna = ( + 2)na,

and invariant under special conformal transformations if, in addition,

0 = dmab,
0 = d (na  fa).

(4.26)

(4.27)

note that the na and fa terms in (4.25) mix under conformal transformations.

4.3. d(2, 1; ) quantum mechanics with fermion multiplets

in this section we work out the r-symmetries and full superconformal algebra for the

special case (3.8) with constant i and e. we assume the existence of a closed homothety

of the form

dai =

2
h

x ai

for some constant h. since ei

a

 is now ei

a

bj = a

bij, which is constant, we have

a

 = ei

a

 d

ldei

2
h

a

ei

.

(4.28)

(4.29)

comparing with (4.13) we see that  and h must be related by  =  2
h .

the rst step is to nd the superconformal generators sr, which are dened by sr =

i[qr, k]. using (4.8) and (4.9), and again suppressing the a index, we nd

s0x j = tj ,
s0j = it x j + 2i
s0 = itb,
s0b = t  + ( 2

h x j,

h  1),

kk + tij ,
k x k  itijb  2i

six j = tij
sij = itij
si = it x i  2i
sib = t i +(cid:0) 2

13

h x i,

h  1(cid:1) i.

as per the discussion in appendix a, the hard part is now to package the {qr, ss} anti-
commutator into a nice form by dening the appropriate r symmetry generators. we nd
that the {q, s} anticommutator has the form
4(h + 1)

(4.31)

{qr, ss} = drs +

h

(t+i)rsri

(ti)rsri

where the t i

 are constant matrices dened by

(t i

and the r symmetry generators are given by

kk  ij),

2 (1  1)ij
x j = i

the t i

 satisfy

[t i

and the r symmetries satisfy

[t i

{t i

thus the r-symmetry of this theory is su (2)  su (2). the r act on the x aj as an
so(3) triplet, so we interpret this su (2) symmetry as arising from the so(3) spatial
rotations of the original theory.2 the x ai are uncharged under r+, so the second su (2)
must come from the su (2) r-symmetry of the original d = 4, n = 2 supergravity. the
four qs transform as complex doublets of each su (2),

[ri

[ri

(ijq0 + ij

(4.36)

and the ss similarly. we recognize (4.31) and (4.36) as the dening relations of the

d(2, 1; ) superalgebra with parameter

 = h  1.

(4.37)

in conclusion, we have demonstrated that an n = 4 supersymmetric theory with
action (3.13) has d(2, 1;  = h  1) symmetry if it admits a closed homothety of the
form (4.28).

2 a more careful analysis shows that so(3) spatial rotations are generated by the diagonal

subgroup r + r+.

5. superconformal symmetry of the near-horizon moduli space

in this section we demonstrate that the quantum mechanics dened by (2.7) admits

a d(2, 1; 0) symmetry in the near-horizon limit. in the near-horizon limit the metric is

where

.

our ansatz for the homothety is

dai =

2
h

xai

for some constant h. it follows from (5.1) and (5.2) that d is a homothety (4.20) if

(xaiai  h)l =

h
2

k

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

where at this point k can be any function in the kernel of the dierential operator of (5.1),

i.e.

gij

klaibj k = 0.

(5.6)

we should be careful since l contains a divergent piece that does not contribute to

the metric. to see this let us separate out two terms as

l = l1 + l2 + l

l1 = 

1

16 xa

m4

az d3x

1

|x  xa|4

(5.7)

(5.8)

where

and

l2 = 

1

4 xa6=b

m3

ambz d3x

1

|x  xa|3|x  xb|

.

(5.9)

these are the only two potentially divergent pieces since all other terms in l contain at
most an integrable singularity |x xa|2 as x  xa (provided that none of the black holes

15

are coincident). moreover, l is homogeneous of degree 1, i.e. l(xai) = 1l(xai),
so eulers theorem tells us that

(xaiai + 1)l = 0.

(5.10)

let us now turn our attention to the divergent terms. first, note that l1 is independent
of xa and thus does not contribute to the metric. if we insert a cuto |x  xa| >  in the
integral (5.9) we nd that

l2 =  xa6=b

m3

amb

ln rab + (1  ln )

rab

.

however, using g(ij)

kl = ijkl it is easy to show that

gij

klcidj

1

rab

= 0

(5.11)

(5.12)

so that the 1  ln  term does not contribute to the metric. thus we nd that l2 is not
homogeneous but instead satises

where

(xaiai + 1)l2 = 

1
2

k

k = 2 xa6=b

m3

amb

1

rab

is in the kernel of gij

klcidj by (5.12). so (5.5) holds for h = 1 and

dai = 2xai

is a homothetic vector eld.

we now show that (4.21) holds, i.e. that

dak = gakbldbl = 2gakblxbl = akk.

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

(5.16)

it turns out (as anticipated by the notation) that the solution to this is precisely the
function k dened in (5.14). to see this, note that l obeys l(oi
jxaj) = l(xai) for any
orthogonal matrix oi

j. thus

xbkmi

kbil = 0

(5.17)

16

since the mi

k generate the so(3) symmetry of r3. a straightforward computation then

reveals that (5.16) holds. this completes the proof that the bosonic part of the sigma

model action admits an sl(2, r) symmetry in the near-horizon limit.

it remains to show that the fermionic terms arising from the supersymmetric com-

pletion of the action are also conformally invariant. it is straightforward to verify from

(5.15), (5.17) and (3.20)(3.25) that conditions (4.23), (4.26) and (4.27) hold for  = 2.
since we have h = 1 the superconformal group is d(2, 1; 0). this is a semi-direct product
of su (1, 1|2) with su (2), where the extra su (2) acts nontrivially on the supercharges of
su (1, 1|2).

the generator k of special conformal transformations has some useful features. con-

formal invariance in quantum mechanics was studied in [19,20] (following the more general

treatment of [21,22]), wherein it is noted that the hamiltonian h of such a theory possesses

neither a ground state nor discrete eigenstates. it was suggested that one should consider,

instead of h eigenstates, eigenstates of

l0 =

1
2

(h + k),

(5.18)

which has a well behaved discrete spectrum of normalizable eigenstates. in our case, the

near-horizon limit of the black hole moduli space has asymptotically locally at regions
corresponding to near-coincident black holes rab  0 for any a 6= b, so the hamiltonian
does not have a ground state or discrete eigenstates. however, the function k (5.14)

diverges in these noncompact regions of the moduli space. thus the operator l0, in which

k serves as a potential to cut o the noncompact regions of the moduli space, will provide a

sensible denition of the quantum mechanics, as per the suggestion of [19] (and in a related

black hole context of [23,24]). a similar story was recently found for ve-dimensional black

holes [10,12,25].

appendix a. a construction of d = 1 superconformal algebras

a generic superconformal algebra in d = 1 dimensions contains the conformal group
sl(2, r) generated by h, d and k, n fermionic supercharges qi, an equal number of
fermionic partners si = i[qi, k], as well as some number of bosonic r-symmetry generators

required for closure of the algebra. a classication of the possible d = 1 superconformal

algebras is obtained by reading o from nahms classication [26] of superalgebras those

in which sl(2, r) is a factored subgroup of the bosonic part of the superalgebra and in

which the fermionic generators sit in a spinorial representation of sl(2, r) [27]. the result

appears in table 1.

table 1. lie superalgebras of classical type3 that contain an sl(2, r) subgroup, adapted
from a table in [27]. for clarity we have written out the n  8 algebras explicitly.

we do not dierentiate the various real (i.e, noncompact) forms of these algebras in our

table. a classication of real simple lie algebras of classical type appears in [29], and the

3 an excellent resource on lie superalgebras is [28].

18

results also appear in [27]. the algebra osp(4|2n) has bosonic part so(4)  u sp(2n),
where so(4) = sl(2, r)  su (2) is a noncompact form of so(4). the superalgebra
p su (1, 1|2) is the quotient of su (1, 1|2), which is not even semi-simple, by the u (1)
generated by the identity matrix. it has become common in the physics literature to use
su (1, 1|2) as a shorthand for p su (1, 1|2), and we adopt this convention throughout this
paper.

the lie superalgebras d(2, 1; ) with  6= 0, 1,  form a one-parameter family of
superalgebras. the algebras with parameters , 1 and 1   are isomorphic [28],
so it is sucient to consider the family of algebras 0 <   1. we have d(2, 1; 1) =
osp(4|2) = osp(4|2). in the limit   0, d(2, 1; ) reduces to a semi-direct product of
su (1, 1|2) with su (2), with the extra su (2) acting nontrivially on the fermionic generators
of su (1, 1|2).

we now describe the construction of a general d = 1 superconformal algebra starting
with generators h, d and k satisfying the sl(2, r) algebra (4.4) and n supercharges qi
satisfying the supersymmetry algebra

it follows that

{qi, qj} = 2ijh.

[h, qi] = 0.

(a.1)

(a.2)

the rst nontrivial constraint is that the qi must have the appropriate conformal weight,

[d, qi] = iqi.

we dene the superconformal operators si through the relation

[k, qi] = isi.

jacobi identities then guarantee that

[h, si] = iqi,

[d, si] = isi,

but one must check that the si dened by (a.4) satisfy4

[k, si] = 0.

4 this is not the only route to take, but it is the one we nd most convenient.

19

(a.3)

(a.4)

(a.5)

(a.6)

the denition (a.4), together with the appropriate jacobi identity, xes the symmetric
part of {qi, sj} to be ijd. we then dene the r-symmetry generator to be the antisym-
metric part, so that

{qi, sj} = ijd + rij
holds. note that there are at most 1
2n (n1) independent generators rij, so the dimension
of the r symmetry algebra of any d = 1 superconformal algebra with n supersymmetries
can be at most 1
2n (n  1). this is just a reection of the fact that the r symmetry
algebra for n real supercharges can be at most so(n ).

(a.7)

another application of the jacobi identity gives

{si, sj}  2ijk = i[k, rij].

(a.8)

the left-hand side is symmetric under i  j while the right-hand side is antisymmetric,
thus both sides must vanish separately. two more applications of the jacobi identity give

[h, rij] = 0 = [d, rij].

(a.9)

we have found from (a.8) and (a.9) that the r symmetry generators dened by (a.7)

commute with sl(2, r).

we have gotten quite far with little eort, but now it is time to pay the piper. as men-
tioned above, the 1
2n (n 1) generators rij may or may not be independent. we therefore
rewrite the rij in terms of dim(r) independent generators ra, a = 1, . . . , dim(r). the
nal constraint on the superalgebra is that the qi live in a spinor representation of r, i.e.

[ra, qi] = i(t a)i

jqj

(a.10)

where the (t a)i

j satisfy

[t a, t b] = f ab
j are the generators of the representation and the f ab
for some constants f ab
are the structure constants of r. in general, the requirement (a.10) places very strong
constraints on the theory in question.

c. the (t a)i

(a.11)

ct c

c

we shall now see that (a.10) xes the rest of the superconformal algebra. since k

commutes with the r symmetry it follows from (a.4) and (a.10) that

[ra, si] = i(t a)i

jsj,

(a.12)

20

so the si necessarily lie in the same representation of r as the qi. finally, an application
of the jacobi identity to (a.10) gives

[ra, rb] = if ab

crc

(a.13)

with the help of (a.11). note that we have reconstructed the algebra of r from the
representation (a.10), so the representation must be faithful.

this completes the construction of the superconformal algebra.

in summary, the

construction requires checking (4.4), (a.1), (a.3), (a.6), (a.10), and (a.11).

appendix b. the osp(1|2) algebra

the n = 1 superconformal algebra osp(1|2) contains sl(2, r) (4.4) as well as two

fermionic generators q and s satisfying

{q, q} = 2h,
[h, q] = 0,

{s, s} = 2k,
[d, q] = iq,

[h, s] = iq,

[d, s] = is,

{q, s} = d,
[k, q] = is,

[k, s] = 0.
