abstract

we derive crystal braneworld solutions, comprising of intersecting families of parallel n+2-
branes in a 4 + n-dimensional ads space. each family consists of alternating positive and
negative tension branes. in the simplest case of exactly orthogonal families, there arise
dierent crystals with unbroken 4d poincare invariance on the intersections, where our
world can reside. a crystal can be nite along some direction, either because that direction
is compact, or because it ends on a segment of ads bulk, or innite, where the branes
continue forever. if the crystal is interlaced by connected 3-branes directed both along
the intersections and orthogonal to them, it can be viewed as an example of a manyfold
universe proposed recently by arkani-hamed, dimopoulos, dvali and the author. there
are new ways for generating hierarchies, since the bulk volume of the crystal and the
lattice spacing aect the 4d planck mass. the low energy physics is sensitive to the
boundary conditions in the bulk, and has to satisfy the same constraints discussed in
the manyfold universe. phenomenological considerations favor either nite crystals, or
crystals which are innite but have broken translational invariance in the bulk. the most
distinctive signature of the bulk structure is that the bulk gravitons are bloch waves, with
a band spectrum, which we explicitly construct in the case of a 5-dimensional theory.

recently a remarkable observation by arkani-hamed, dimopoulos and dvali that there
may exist additional sub-millimeter spatial dimensions [1] has generated tremendous in-
terest. in such theories, the usual standard model degrees of freedom are localized to a
3-brane which is embedded in a higher-dimensional bulk, and thus at low energies are in-
dierent to the extra dimensions. on the other hand, gravity and, typically, other weakly
coupled elds live in the bulk, probing equally all spatial dimensions. the observed weak-
ness of gravity in four dimensions is generated naturally, because by spreading through
all spatial dimensions gravity becomes softer, as can be seen immediately from gauss law.
hence the hierarchy between the planck scale, mp l  1019gev and the electroweak scale,
mew  t ev and its radiative stability, can be naturally explained if the size of the n
internal dimensions r is large: m 2

p l = m 2+n

ew [1].

studies of phenomenological constraints in [1] have conrmed that such models are
consistent with observations, with the unication scale as low as few  10 t ev . there
has subsequently been much interest in models with large extra dimensions [2]-[8]. string
theory may give rise to such models, with the radius of compactication only a few orders
of magnitude above the planck scale, such as in horava-witten [10, 11], intermediate sizes

 (t ev )1 [12, 13], and even  (mp l/m)2/nm1 < mm [2, 14].

the concept of localization of matter to the branes plays a key role in masking the
large extra dimensions from observation at low energies. in fact, the universe as a domain
wall in a non-compact space has been considered before [15, 16], but there gravity was
higher-dimensional at all scales. but if gravity itself is localized to the 3-brane, then
4d gravity can be reproduced at low energies even if the extra dimensions are much
larger than a mm. a very interesting recent construction by randall and sundrum [17]
provides an elegant example of this idea for the case of one extra dimension, which is
linearly innite, but has nite proper volume. similar ideas have been explored also in
[18]. subsequently it has been shown that gravity can be localized to intersections of
n + 2 branes in 4 + n-dimensional spaces [19]. more examples were found later [20], and
various issues [21]-[25] were considered. since the randall-sundrum proposal [17] employs
ads bulk geometry, it is possible to view the model in the framework of the ads/cf t
correspondence [26, 27]. interpreting the fth dimension as the scale of the 4d theory
[28] and the evolution along it as the holographic renormalization group [29], this model
can be rephrased as a 4d cf t theory coupled with gravity [30], without invoking extra
dimensions. the ads/cf t correspondence has also been pursued in [31].

on a dierent track, it is possible that our 3-brane is not alone in the bulk. in fact,
the bulk may be populated by many other branes, if we wish to understand the weak
breaking of symmetries by shining in the bulk [5]. hence, the universe may contain many
nearby branes, which are dark because the light travels only along them, but are felt
by their gravity [32]. this manyfold universe has been considered recently by arkani-
hamed, dimopoulos, dvali and the author [32], and it has been shown that it can be
consistent with the observations, while giving rise to many new phenomena: dark matter
candidates which are dissipationful, dark stars, hybrids, neutrino mixing, susy breaking

1

et cetera. some solutions representing multi-brane congurations in 5d spacetimes have
been constructed [33], and some aspects of brane networks considered [34, 35].

in this paper, we will construct explicit solutions of einsteins equations which repre-
sent intersecting families of parallel n + 2-branes in 4 + n-dimensional ads spacetimes.
each family will contain branes of alternating tension. while we are a little reluctant
to treat the negative tension branes on equal footing with the positive tension ones, we
will ignore this when considering the solutions because of considerable technical simpli-
cation.
if the bulk cosmological constant is replaced by a potential, there may exist
solutions which involve only positive tension branes, while sharing some generic prop-
erties with our solutions. alternatively, a rst-principles construction of branes with
negative tension may yet ensue. we will show that there arise several dierent crystal
solutions, all of which support the usual 4d gravity. however phenomenological consider-
ations strongly favor nite crystals or crystals which are innite but have strongly broken
translational symmetry, where our world arises as a lattice defect. if a crystal is inter-
laced by a grid of 3-branes, some along the intersections and others stretching between
them, the low energy physics of such a solution is identical to that of a manyfold universe
[32]. such a crystal would have to be subject to the same astrophysical constraints as
any generic manyfold [32]. we will further show that the spectrum of bulk gravitons has
band structure, with a gap at zero energy, because the bulk gravitons are bloch waves,
like electrons in ordinary crystals. this may allow the string scale in a 5d theory to be
as low as m  100t ev , at the cost of having n  1016 branes in the 5d ads space-
time. however, the reward consists of reproducing the 4d planck scale mp l  1019gev ,
the electroweak scale mew  1t ev and suppressing the corrections to newtons law at
distances  1mm. it may be possible to reduce the number of required branes by going
to more than one extra dimensions.

we begin by deriving the solution describing the crystal braneworlds. consider an
array of n orthogonal families of n + 2-spatial dimensional branes in a 4 + n-dimensional
spacetime, with a bulk cosmological constant . for simplicity we take the branes in each
family to have identical tension k. the eld equations can be derived from the action

which appear in (2) reduce to qgkk for simple diagonal metrics, however in

general they cannot be gauged away.

deriving the solutions is straightforward [19]. away from the branes, the bulk geom-
etry consists of patches of the 4 + n-dimensional ads space. on the branes, there are
additional -function singularities, which cause discontinuities in the derivatives of the
metric. to nd the global solution, valid on the complete manifold, we should seek the
solution in the form

and adjust the boundary conditions for 1 such that it solves einsteins equations (2),
and between the branes reproduces the metric of ads bulk. it is convenient to recast
the einsteins equations (2) in the conformal frame gab = 2gab. we use the standard
relation for 4 + n spacetime dimensions

it is now clear from the rst of equations (5) that 1 is a linear combination of greens
functions for each family of parallel branes. since the tensions k are the strengths of
sources, they control the discontinuity of the derivatives of 1 on each brane. it is easy
4

to see that the discontinuities must satisfy (k1)2 =
4(n+2)2 . thus the discontinuity in

the gradient of 1 on each intersection of branes must satisfy (~1)2 =

because the second of eqs. (5) is dened globally, these two expressions must coincide,

hence the condition for the existence of the solutions is to ne tune the tensions of the
branes to the bulk cosmological constant according to (6). then as we see from (3) the
induced metric on the intersections is minkowski, meaning that the conditions (6) amount
to ne tuning the eective 4d cosmological constant on each intersection to zero.

we can now solve the rst of (5) as follows. suppose that in each family there is nk
parallel branes, which for reasons of simplicity we have taken to be equidistant, separated
by lk, as is seen in eqs. (2) and (5). the solution can be easily generalized when the
distances between the branes vary within each family, as will become clear from the
construction below. the eqs. (5) yield the solution for the conformal factor 

xk=1s(zk) + 1

these two equations follow from (5) by using linear superposition, eq. (6) and the def-
inition of the ads radius. the integration constant in (7) must be nonzero in order to
excise the ads boundary from the manifold, and is set to unity by gauge choice. as a
result, the warp factor never diverges; otherwise there could not exist a normalizable 4d
graviton mode.

it is easy to see that the function s(zk) which solves eqs. (8) must be the sawtooth

function. we can write it as follows:

the solutions dier globally depending on the boundary conditions for each s(zk). in
general there are four distinct types of boundary conditions:

(i) there is a discrete innity of branes along the kth axis, and the crystal is innite

in this direction;

(ii) there is nk = 2nk + 1 branes, and nk + 1 have positive tension and nk negative;
the crystal ends on branes with positive tension in each direction along the zk axis; outside
of the crystal there is the near-horizon geometry of ads space, with the horizon located
at innite proper spatial distance from each end;

(iii) the crystal is semi-innite along the zk axis, with innitely many branes, and
boundary conditions satisfying (i) on one end and (ii) on the other; the brane at one end
must have positive tension;

.

s(zk) = 


for (2p  1)lk < zk < 2plk;
2plk < zk < (2p + 1)lk;

(9)

(iv) the crystal is nite along zk, with an even number nk = 2nk of distinct branes
along the zk axis, a half of them with positive and a half with negative tension; the
solution can be viewed as case (ii) but with the 0th and 2nk + 1th branes identied; this
means, that the zk axis is compactied on a circle.

by linear superposition, the global solution for the crystal is a combination of any of
the four possibilities realized along individual axes. for the case (i), the solution for the
sawtooth functions is adequately represented by an innite array of the form (9). in the
other three cases, by choosing the origin of the coordinate system in the bulk to lie at the
end brane with positive tension, we can rewrite the solution in a more compact form:

s(zk) = 2

nk

(1)j(zk  jlk)(zk  jlk)  zk,
xj=0

(10)

where nk = 2nk + 1 in the case (ii), nk   in the case (iii), and nk = 2nk in the case
(iv). therefore, in terms of these functions, the metric can be written down as

(11)

this is the solution for the crystal manyfold universe. by the conditions (6), all the
vertices of the crystal lattice correspond to the 4d minkowski spacetimes, and can ac-
commodate 3-branes which localize the standard model particles. therefore, our world
could reside at any one of the vertices, leading to dierent low energy theory, as long
as there exists a massless 4d graviton mode. the 3-branes lying on the other vertices
would behave as mirror worlds, and can be connected to our own by additional 3-branes
embedded in the intersecting n + 2-branes. hence a crystal interlaced by 3-branes would
give rise to a manyfold universe structure of [32].

it is straightforward to verify that the theory dened by the action (1) in general admits
4d massless graviton modes on the backgrounds (11). hence at large distances these
modes will give leading contributions to the gravitational interactions between particles
localized to the intersections, reproducing the usual newtons law and masking the extra
dimensions. the wave function of these modes is

h 0(x, ~z)  (2n)/2(~z)eikx

,

(12)

as we will see below in more detail. using (1) and (12), by ignoring the massive kk
modes and reducing the theory (1) to four dimensions, we nd that the 4d planck mass
is

(13)

the integral has to be performed over the whole crystal space, which is composed of
a number of patches of a dierent kind. depending on the type, there may be semi-
innite patches comprised of the near-horizon segments of ads bounded by branes of

5

1

positive tensions. each such patch is identical to the patches considered in the case of a
p l [19]. however, since now
single intersection of branes, contributing
there are also patches of geometry which are completely bounded by branes, there arise
additional contributions to m 2
p l. dierent patches, or cells, can be classied by counting
how many branes they are bounded by, such that the integrations in those directions
would be bounded between 0 and lk. it is clear from (7) and (9) that all topologically
identical segments give the same contribution to the mass integral. each distinct integral
needs to be weighed by the symmetry factor, which counts the total number of cells of a

where bj are combinations of {lp+1, ..., ln} of length j. to compute the symmetry factors,
we break up the crystal into topologically inequivalent cells. these are distinguished by
how many of their sides end on ads horizon. clearly, the cells inside the crystal only
end on branes, and correspond to taking p = 0 in (15). we can count the cells in each
topological class as follows. in the case of 1d crystals, we can divide the cells along the
crystal into two types, a and b. the type a are the cells inside the crystal, which end on
branes on both sides, and there is nk of them. the type b cells end on the ads horizon,
and there is at most two of them. then the crystal (11) can be represented formally as a
direct product

where the number of end branes is  = 0, 1 or 2 depending on the boundary conditions.
it is then obvious that the number of elementary cells which end on the ads horizon in
p directions is given by the coecient of bp in the expansion of (16):

p =  nxcp ycp

[n

(17)

where cp is any set of n  p distinct elements from the set {1, ..., n}, and [r] denotes
rounding o the number r to the nearest smaller integer. specically, the number of
cells inside the crystal, with p = 0 is 0 =  nqn
 ]. note that the total number of
branes along kth direction is set by the boundary conditions (i)-(iv). hence we obtain the
following formula for the 4d planck mass:

(18)

where bj are combinations of length j of elements of {lc(1), ..., lc(np)}, and c(k)  cp. in
the special case of nite crystals with cubic global symmetry and two end branes, there is
the same number of branes in each direction, n1 = ... = nn = n , and the lattice spacing
is the same in all directions, l1 = ... = ln = l. therefore all cps of the same length

it is now obvious that for either class of nite crystals, (ii) or (iv), the formula (18) gives a
nite value for the 4d planck mass, meaning that there is a 4d graviton. in eect, those
crystal congurations eectively compactify the extra dimensions. in the case of innite
crystals (i) and (iii), although each individual contribution to (18) is nite, formally the
sum diverges since there is an innite number of cells to sum over. however, the sum
can be renormalized at the expense of loosing a one-to-one correspondence between the
4d and (4 + n)d planck scales. indeed, for innite crystals m 2
 ln  ,
since n  . since the divergence comes from the bulk volume being innite, the
renormalization must be a bulk phenomenon. to renormalize mp l, we recall that since
by the ne-tuning condition (6) the bulk cosmological constant is related to the brane
tensions, and since the brane tensions must be unaected by a bulk renormalization, the
ads radius must also be unaected. hence, the only way to remove innity from mp l is
to take m to be innite, and renormalize it by mbare  n n/(n+2)m. but this means
that the resulting mass m need not be related to the scale of the brane physics, and
hence this would seem to require another ne tuning to explain the hierarchy between
mp l and mew .

p l  n nm 2+n

on the other hand, eq. (19) shows that for nite crystals there are additional possi-
bilities for generating hierarchies. this is because mp l depends on four dierent scales:

the fundamental scale m, the ads radius l = (nk)1, the lattice spacing l and the
total volume of the crystal  (n l)n. hence it is easier to generate exponential hierarchies
in large crystals, even if all the other scales are of the same order of magnitude.

before we move on to study the bulk gravitons, we should note that innite and semi-
innite cases (i) and (iii) are also disfavored phenomenologically, even if we perform a
renormalization as outlined above. in an innite crystal there is an innite number of
intersections. discrete translational invariance of the crystal would require that the energy
density of particles on each intersection is of the same order (which would remain true even
if the symmetry is weakly broken). because at long distances the gravitational force is
dominated by the zero modes, an observer on any intersection would feel the gravitational
eld of particles localized to all the intersections in the crystal regardless of how far in
the bulk they are. thus the localized energy density everywhere would add up to give
the total energy density controlling the cosmological evolution of all intersections. hence
to sum up to a nite value, the energy density on each intersection must be innitesimal.
this implies that all but an innitesimal amount of the energy density of the universe

7

we experience would have to be dark. note that this remains true regardless of any
renormalization of the scales, which may or may not be necessary (in a fashion similar to
that for mp l). the matter on distant intersections would still be dark, there would be
innitely many of them, and renormalization would not change the ratio of dark matter to
visible matter. since the amount of visible matter in our universe is not innitesimal, we
see that at least one intersection in the crystal must have nite , and most of the others
cannot. hence the discrete translational invariance of the crystal must be strongly broken.
our intersection is a defect of the lattice. it cannot deform the lattice too strongly, in order
not to loose the 4d graviton. but it does suggest that the graviton zero mode accumulates
around the defect, which deforms the background more than most of the other vertices
in the lattice. this can generate a peaked prole for the wave function of the zero mode,
making other intersections weakly coupled. such possibilities for generating asymmetric
mirror worlds have been discussed in [32]. in practice, therefore, an innite crystal would
have to be physically hardly distinguishable from a nite crystal, with the exception that
the strong coupling regime, discussed in [17], could be absent. a nite crystal would
have to be consistent with observational constraints much like the manyfold universes
in theories with sub-millimeter internal dimensions [32]. thus, an innite crystal with
unbroken discrete translational invariance may be only a mathematical idealization. we
will retain it, however, since it is quite useful for the study of bulk gravitons, to which we
now turn.

the eld equation for linear perturbations around the background solution can be
obtained by expanding the 4d part of the metric according to g = g + h, where h
is in the transverse traceless gauge with respect to the background h
 = 0,
and expanding the einsteins equations to linear order in h. the perturbations satisfy

this equation is a static schrodinger equation for an electron in a periodic potential. it
is now clear that the lowest energy eigenfunction of (23), which corresponds to the 4d
graviton zero mode, is 0  const with m2 = 0, which by (21) reproduces precisely (12),
as we claimed. for m2 > 0, the analogy with the electron in a crystal shows that the
solutions of (23) are bloch waves, satisfying ~q(~z) = exp(i~q  ~z)v~q(~z), where by floquets
theorem v~q are periodic functions under the action of the discrete translation group.
the energy spectrum has a band structure due to resonant scattering. the bands are
continuous in innite crystals, and discrete in nite ones. in addition, there is a mass
gap, separating the lowest-lying excited state from the ground state by a nite energy.
in the language of our crystal manyfold, this means that the lightest kk graviton must
have a nite mass, and that the kk modes come in bands. as a result, their inuence on
the low energy physics on the intersection will be signicantly suppressed when compared
to a single brane of [17] or a single intersection of [19]. this is true not only for the
production of bulk gravitons by the collisions of the standard model particles, but also
for the corrections to newtons law of gravity. due to the gap, there will be an exponential
suppression of the higher-order corrections to the inverse square law. mass gap was also
discussed in [23] and in [35].

to be more concrete, we focus on an innite crystal with only one internal dimension.
finite crystals will behave similarly, when they consist of many branes, except that the
allowed bands will be discrete rather than continuous. we expect that the qualitative
properties of crystals with more than one internal dimension will remain similar. in the
case of one extra dimension, the schrodinger equation (23) reduces to

by the analogy with electrons in a crystal, e.g. with the kronig-penney model, we need to
solve this equation inside two adjacent elementary cells in the crystal. by the periodicity
of (11), we can choose the elementary cells 0 < z < 2l and 2l < z < 4l. the -function
potentials in (24) can be recast as the boundary conditions on the derivatives of  at the
vertices: (l+)  (l) = 3
l+l (l) and (2l+)  (2l) =  3
l (2l). moreover, the
wave function at each vertex must satisfy (vertex+) = (vertex) in order to conserve
probability. the dierential equation in the rst elementary cell is

here h2 are the hankel functions, which generalize the plane waves for the case of the
bessel equation. they should be used instead of the real bessel functions, since they
are needed to encode the momentum by phase rotation. it is rather amusing that both
classical 4d graviton polarizations are needed to mimic the quantum-mechanical phase.
bloch waves physically correspond to rotation of the polarization plane of bulk gravitons
in the crystal. in evaluating the transmission and reection coecients in (26) on the
-function, we have used a recursive relation dh 
w h2 . then we can evaluate
the functions and derivatives at l, and using the boundary conditions eliminate c and
d in favor of a and b, and have the function in each elementary cell be determined by
two (complex) constants, just like in the kronig-penney model.

where we have dened the numbers hk = hk (m(l + l)) and hk = hk (ml). the last
condition will give an equation relating q and m, because the normalization constant
a factors out:
it is determined by the overall normalization of the wave function. the
equation for q is the band equation. a straightforward computation gives

cos(lq) =

(j2n1 + j1n2)(j2n1 + j1n2)  j1j2(j1j2 + 3n1n2)  n1n2(3j1j2 + n1n2)

k , nk = im h +

in this equation, we have decomposed the hankel functions into the bessel functions
jk and nk, jk = re h +
k , with the denitions jk = jk(m(l + l)), nk =
nk(m(l + l)), jk = jk(ml) and nk = nk(ml). to see that there is a gap in the spectrum
already at zero momentum, we can substitute q = 0 in (30). the resulting condition for
the lowest-lying mass m is the gap equation:
j1j2j1j2 + n1n2n1n2 + j2j2n1n1 + j1j1n2n2 = 3j1j2n1n2 + 3j1j2n1n2 3j1j2n1n2 3j1j2n1n2.
(31)
it is evident that this equation provides a non-trivial constraint on m. finding the lowest
positive value of m which solves this equation is a straightforward, albeit tedious task.
however, for l > l we can readily obtain the correct order of magnitude of the gap. since
the bessel functions in (31) are evaluated at m(l + l) and ml, the only two candidates
for mass scales for mgap are l1 and (l + l)1. on the other hand, in the limit l  ,
the crystal solution reduces to the single brane solution of [17], where the bulk gravitons
do not have a gap. this excludes l1. hence the mass gap must be

mgap = o(1)
l + l

.

(32)

with this at hand, it is easy to estimate the corrections to newtons law in 4d induced
by bulk gravitons. by the form of the wave functions (26), the 4d newtonian potential
for particles localized to a 3-brane at the intersection of 4-branes with positive tension
(planck1 brane), with the corrections from the bulk gravitons, is

vn = gn

where a and b are constants of order unity. note that because of the gap, the corrections
are o(r2), in contrast to o(r3) in [17]. on the other hand, using eq. (11) when l > l,
the potential for particles localized to a 3-brane at the intersection of branes with negative
tension (t ev brane) is, roughly,

vn = gn

m1m2

(cid:16)1 + az

which gives

and again a and b are (dierent) constants of order unity. clearly the corrections to new-
tons law for particles on the planck brane can remain small at sub-millimeter distances

1the nickname planck refers to the 5d planck scale m, not the 4d mp l.

l  t ev . hence m 2

even if l  lp l  1034mm, despite the fact that there is only ve spacetime dimensions.
however, the corrections become more signicant on the t ev brane, as is clear from (36).
but if we are to solve the hierarchy problem while suppressing the corrections to 4d
gravity to satisfy the observable bounds, our world should be a t ev brane. therefore,
the existing observational constraints yield l3  1mm  l2, i.e. l  1mm  ( l
l )2 < 1mm.
further, if l > l, eq. (19) gives m 2
 ln , and so the 4d planck mass depends
on the size of the crystal and the lattice spacing. the fundamental scale should satisfy
m  l
l2 n , and using l  ev 1  1mm, for which
l  1012m1
ensuring the validity of the supergravity description of the solution (11),

gives n  1016. with this choice of numbers, the standard model on the t ev branes
has scale mew  1t ev , and its mirror on the planck branes has scale m  100t ev .
while the number of branes required is clearly very large, being equal to mp l
t ev , i.e. to the
hierarchy between the scales, it is smaller by sixteen orders of magnitude than the max-
imal number of branes which t inside the at extra dimensions [4]. note also that the
size of the crystal is n l  1012mm, with the choice m  100t ev , which is four orders
of magnitude smaller than the size of a at compact dimension required to generate the
same ratio mp l
[1]. the required number of branes could be reduced in the case of more
mew
extra dimensions, but the details are beyond the scope of the present article.

it is straightforward to generalize this discussion when the lattice spacing varies within
each family of parallel branes.
in the extreme case, the conguration may be more
similar to few separate crystals residing at dierent places in the ads bulk. the eective
scale would change from crystal to crystal, and in the infrared limit the low energy 4d
physics on distant crystals would be similar to that on a 3-brane far from an intersection
[19], or far from the planck brane in 5d [22], or to a manyfold with bulk proles [32].
with several crystals in the bulk, it is easier to generate hierarchy with fewer branes in
each crystal, as is straightforward to verify.
in fact, separated small crystals would
correspond precisely to the cases of distant branes discussed in [19, 22], where hierarchy
is generated by gravitational shining.

we close with several concluding remarks. we have constructed general solutions
describing intersecting families of parallel n + 2-branes in 4 + n-dimensional ads space.
the families intersect at right angles, and consist of branes with both positive and negative
tension. as a result, there arise several dierent types of crystals, both nite and innite.
all of them give rise to the usual 4d gravity, but phenomenological considerations strongly
favor either nite crystals or innite ones with broken translational invariance, proles in
the bulk and our world as a lattice defect. if such solutions are interlaced by 3-branes,
at low energies they behave the same as manyfold universes of [32]. the periodicity of
the crystal lattice implies that the bulk gravitons are bloch waves, with a band spectrum
and a gap at zero energy. we construct the spectrum explicitly in the case of one extra
dimension, and nd that in the extreme case it may be possible to have the string scale at
 100t ev , if there is  1016 branes in the conguration. the crystal worlds raise many
interesting questions: the issues of stability, early cosmology, etc. while the bulk gravitons
behave as electrons in the usual crystal, one may wonder which degrees of freedom play

12

role of the conventional phonons. it seems plausible that they should be the goldstone
modes associated with the branes in the crystal, which may get excited by suciently
strong external perturbations. a more precise consideration would be needed to test this.
further, it would be interesting to nd the properties of higher-dimensional crystals, since
they may require fewer branes to resolve the hierarchy problem while ensuring newtons
law of gravity in 4d at distances larger than a millimeter. we hope to return to some of
these issues in the future.
