abstract

charret et. al. applied the properties of the grassmann generators to develop a
new method to calculate the coecientes of the high temperature expansion of the grand
canonical partition function of self-interacting fermionic models in any d-dimensions
(d  1). the method explores the anti-commuting nature of fermionic elds and avoids
the calculation of the fermionic path integral. we apply this new method to the relativistic
free dirac fermions and recover the known results in the literature.

introduction

the path integral approach has been extensively applied to calculate the thermodynamic prop-
erties of the quantum eld theories[1, 2, 3]. through this approach, it has been calculated the
leading contribution, in the high temperature limit (  1, where  = 1
kt ), to the eective
potencial of these theories[2, 4]. we also have a standard high temperature perturbation theory
derived from the path integral expression of the partition function[5, 6]. in the calculation of

the helmholtz free energy, via the path integral approach, we do not keep track of its contri-
bution that are -independent. in general this contribution is irrelevant to the thermodynamic

properties of the model, but even we are not going to deal here with supersymmetric models,
we remember that this contributions are crucial to verify if the supersymmtry is broken or not

at nite temperature[7, 8, 9], since for a theory to be supersymmetric the value of its vacuum
energy has to be zero.

for theories involving bosons, in the path integral we rst integrate over the conjugate

momenta. bernard[1] showed that in this case we have to be carefull in constructing the path
integral to get the overall -dependent constant of the grand canonical partition function.

this constant does not appear in pure fermionic models since in these cases the momentum
conjugate to the fermionic elds are their own hermitian conjugate. even for these fermionic

models, along the calculation of the partition function done via the path integral approach, we
get -independent terms that are dropped out (see the free fermion case that is fully discussed

in reference [3]).

the partition function of free fermions models is calculated directly from its path integral
expression since it is equal to the determinant of its dynamical operator [3, 10]. when the

lagrangean density of model has self-interacting fermionic terms, it is not possible any more
to calculate exactly the non-gaussian non-commutative path integral. one common approach

is to get the bosonized version of the model[11]. another standard way to handle the path
integral over non-commutative function is to do a perturbation theory taking care of the signs

coming from fermion loops[1, 2, 3].

the interesting properties of the non-commutative grassmann algebra has been applied
to get the contributions from spin congurations to the partition function of the classical

bidimensional ising model[12]. in reference [13] charret et al. proposed a new way to calculate
the coecients of the high temperature expansion of the grand canonical partition function
of self-interacting fermionic models in d-dimensions (d  1). they applied the method to
the hatsugay-kohmoto model[13], that is an exactly solvable model. the approach was also

applied to the unidimensional generalized hubbard model to get the coecents up to order

2

3 of the high temperature expansion of its grand canonical partition function[14]. dierently
from other approaches, these coecients calculated by this method are analytical and exact.

up to now the approach of charret et al. has only been applied to fermionic models already

regularized on a lattice with space unit one[13, 14]. the aim of the present paper is to use this
method to calculate the helmholtz free energy of the free fermion dirac, that is a continous

theory and whose exact result is already known in the literature[3].
check its application to a fermionic lattice model[10].

it is also important to

in section 2 we give a summary of the results of the method of charret et al. fully described
in section 3 we apply the approach to the free dirac fermion using two
in subsection 3.1 we rst expand the fermionic eld operators in the basis of

in reference [13].
expansions:

the eigenstates of energy and in subsection 3.2 we consider the naive fermion model on a
three dimensional space lattice.
in both ways, we show that is possible to re-sum the high

temperature expansion of the grand canonical partition function of the model and compare our
results with the known ones in the literature[3, 10]. in appendix a we present the formulae

related to the lagrangean density of the free dirac fermion. in appendix b we have a dictionary
of some formulae showing their continuun and discrete expressions.

2 a survey of the approach of charret et al.

the grand canonical partition function of any quantum system can be written as a trace over
all quantum physical states[3, 15]

z() = t r[ek],

(1)

where  = 1
kt , k is the boltzmanns constant and t is the absolute temperature. the operator
k is dened as k = hn, h being the hamiltonian of the system,  is the chemical potential
and n is a conserved operator. in the high temperature limit (  1), z() has the expansion

z() = t r[1l] +

()n
n!



xn=1

t r[kn].

(2)

the spectation value of any fermionic operator can be written as a multivariable integral over

grassmann variables[16, 17]. the mapping among the fermionic operators that appear in the
fermionic model and the grassmannian generators is such that they satisfy the same algebra.
let a
i and aj be the hermitian conjugate fermionic operators that satisfy the anti-commuting
relations

3

{ai, a

j} = 1l ij

(3)
where i = 1, ..,n . the generators of the associated grassmann algebra has dimension 22n ,
and can be written explicitly as {1,   , n ; 1,   , n}. they satisfy the following anti
commutation relations:

{ai, aj} = 0,

and

{i, j} = 0,

{i, j} = 0

and

{i, j} = 0.

the mapping

a
i  i

and

aj 


 j

,

(4)

(5)

preserves the algebra (3) due to the algebra (4) satised by the grassmannian generators.

for any self-interacting fermionic model in a d-dimension lattice (d  1), the coecients of

high temperature expansion (2) can be written as the multivariable grassmann integral[13]

t r[kn] = z

2nn d

didi ep2nn d
yi=1
k(cid:13)n(, ,  = 0)k(cid:13)n(, ,  = 1) . . .k(cid:13)n(, ,  = n  1),

i,j =1 i ai,j j 

(6)

n d is the number of sites in the d-dimensional lattice. matrix a is independent of the operators
h and n and is equal to

a =   a ol

ol a ! .

(7)

each element of matrix a is a matrix of dimension nn d  nn d and ol is the null matrix in
this dimension. the indices i, j in matrix a vary in the interval, i, j = 1, 2, . . . , 2nn d. the
matrices a and a are equal and

a = a =

,

(8)

1ln dn d 1ln dn d oln dn d
1ln dn d 1ln dn d
oln dn d

...

. . . oln dn d
. . . oln dn d

...

1ln dn d oln dn d

oln dn d

. . . 1ln dn d







where 1ln dn d and oln dn d are the identity and null matrices of dimension n d  n d respectively.
due to the fact that the submatrices a and a are null, the result of the multivariable integral
(6) is equal to the product of the independent contributions of the sectors  = and  =.

4

the grassmannian function k(cid:13)n(, ) in eq.(6) is obtained from the normal ordered operator

k by doing the naive mapping: a

i,  i and ai,  i, where i = 1, 2, ..., n d and  =,.

finally, the result of the integrals that contribute to t r[kn] are independent of the 
sector since a = a. we present here only the results of the integrals of the sector  =.
all those integrals are of the following type:

m(l, k) = z

nn d

yi=1

didi l1k1 . . . lmkm epnn d

i,j=1 ia

ij j ,

(9)

where l  {l1, . . . , lm} and k  {k1, . . . , km}. we should remember that the grassmannians
functions k(cid:13)n are polynomials of the generators of the algebra. the products  are ordered
such that l1 < l2 < ... < lm and k1 < k2 < ... < km. the results of the integrals of type (9)
are[18]

m(l, k) = (1)pm

i=1(li+ki)a(l, k),

(10)

where a(l, k) is the determinant obtained from matrix a by the cut of the lines l1, l2, ..., lm
and the columns k1, k2, ..., km. m(l, k) is a co-factor of matrix a. result (10) reduce the
calculation of the multivariable integrals over anti-commuting variables to the calculation of

co-factors of a well dened matrix whose elements are commuting numbers.

in general it should not be easy to calculate the co-factors of matrix a since each of its
elements is a matrix of dimension n d  n d. however, due to the block structure of matrix a
charret et. al showed in reference [13] that is possible diagonalize it for any value of n and n.
the results are analytical and allow us to take the thermodynamic limit.

3 grand canonical partition function for free

relativistic fermions

the lagrangean density of the free dirac fermion is:

l = (~x, t)(/  m)(~x, t),

whose fermionic eld operators satisfy the anti-commutation ralations

{(~x, t), (~x, t)} = i(~x  ~x),

,  = 1, 2, 3, 4

and

{(~x, t), (~x, t)} = {(~x, t), (~x, t)} = 0,

(11)

(12)

(13)

5

where (~x, t) is the canonical momentum of (~x, t) and (~x, t) = i

(~x, t).

from the lagrangean density (11) and the equation of motion satised by the fermionic eld

operators, the total hamiltonian operator of the system can be written as

h = zv

d3~x i(~x, t)0(~x, t).

(14)

we use the natural units where h = c = e = 1. our metric is diag(g) = (1,1,1,1).

3.1 expansion in the basis of eigenstates of energy

the fermionic operator (~x, t) written in the basis of eigenstates of energy of the free dirac

fermion is

(~x, t) =

1

v 1/2 x~k

2

[ar(~k)ur(~k)eikx
xr=1

+ b

r(~k)vr(~k)eikx

],

(15)

where kx = k0x0  ~k.~x, and k0 = q|~k|2 + m2 > 0. the destruction fermionic operators ar,

br and their respective hermitian conjugate satisfy the anti-commutation relations

{ar(~k), a

s(~k)} = rs~k,~k

and

{br(~k), b

s(~k)} = rs~k,~k.

(16)

all others anti-commutation relations of these operators are null. the spinors components
ur(~k) and vr(~k) are given by eqs.(49) and (50).

the hamiltonian operator written in terms of creation and destruction operators of dened

energy becomes

h = 1lx~k

xr=1

xr=1

k0[a

(17)

1l been the identity operator. we dene e0 as the vacuum energy, e0  h0|h|0i = 2p~k k0,
|0i being the vacuum state of the fermionic model.

our aim is to calculate the grand canonical partition function of the free dirac fermion in

contact with a reservoir of heat and electric charge. eqs. (6), (9) and (10) allow us to calculate
the coecients of the high temperature expansion of this function. for the present case, the
operator k in expression (1) is: k =: h : +e01l  q, where  is the chemical potential and
q is the total electric charge operator of the free relativistic fermions. operator q written in
terms of the creation and destruction operators is

6

q = 2x~k

1l +x~k
 q01l+ : q :

r(~k)ar(~k)  b
[a

r(~k)br(~k)].

2

xr=1

.

finally, we have that k operator can be written as

k = x~k

(k0  )a
xr=1

r(~k)ar(~k) +x~k

xr=1

 ka + kb + 1l(e0  q0).

(k0 + )b

r(~k)br(~k) + 1l(e0  q0)

(18)

(19)

due to the anti-commutation relations (16), we have that [ka, kb] = 0, and therefore z() can
be written as

where

z() = e(e0q0)za().zb(),

za()  t ra[eka]

and

zb()  t rb[ekb].

(20)

(21)

the calculation of the functions za() and zb() are equivalent. we present here only the
details of the calculation of za(). for a free dirac fermion, the traces for r = 1 and r = 2 are
equal. then,

za() = t ra[eka] = [t r(1)
a [e(k0)n(1)

t r(1)

a [ek(1)

.

(22)

a we have the vector ~k xed. since n(1)

a (~k) is a commuting operator, we apply the newton

in t r(1)
multinomial to write

t r(1)

a [e(k0)n(1)

a (~k)] = t r(1)

a [1l] +

()n
n!



xn=1

(k0  )nt r(1)

a [n(1)

a (~k)n].

(23)

we should note that for xed ~k the anti-commutation relations (16) are identitical to the
a (~k)n] can be written as a grassmann multivariable integral
relations (3), therefore, t r(1)
(6) with an equivalent mapping to eq.(5) for the associated generators of the non-commutative

a [n(1)

algebra. the traces that contribute to eq.(23) are written as the following anti-commuting
integrals:

for (n > 0).

(25)

a [n(1)

a (~k)n] is obtained from eq.(6) with n = 1 and d = 1.
the grassmannian expression for t r(1)
therefore the elements of matrix a(11) in eq.(8) are just numbers. from eqs.(9) and (10),
we conclude that having the s in the integrand corresponds to deleting the rst n lines in
matrix a(11) and, in the same way, having the s corresponds to deleting the rst n columns
of the same matrix. therefore, from the expression of matrix a(11) (see eq.(8)), for arbitrary
n, we realize that the matrix a(11)
obtained after the cuts of n-rst lines and n-rst collumns
is an upper triangular matrix whose determinant is equal to 1. beside this, we have that
det[a(11)] = 2, for any value of n. in summary, for arbitrary n we have that

n

t r(1)

a [1l] = 2

and

t r(1)

a [n(1)

a (~k)n] = 1.

substituting results (26) in expression (25) and resumming it we get

t r(1)

a [ek(1)

a ] = y~k

(1 + e(k0)),

that returning to eq.(20) gives us

z() = [y~k

e2(k0+)(1 + e(k0))(1 + e(k0+))]2.

(26)

(27)

(28)

the relation between the helmholtz free energy and the grand canonical partition function

is[15]

substituting result (28) in eq.(29) the expression derived for the helmholtz free energy is

w() =

ln(z()).

(29)

w() =

[(k0 + ) + ln(1 + e(k0)) + ln(1 + e(k0+))].

3.2 free dirac fermions on the lattice

the lattice calculation of models including fermions has been an important tool to learn the

properties of these models. the aim of this subsection is to show that the method of charret
et al. can be equally well applied to the lattice version of fermionic models. to do so, we

consider the most naive lattice realization of the free dirac fermion[10]. we remember that the
crucial point to apply the method of charret et al. is to work with fermionic eld operators
that satisfy the anti-commutation relations (3).

the hamiltonian operator of the free dirac fermion is

h = zv

d3~x i(~x, t)[0~  ~  m0](~x, t),

(31)

where ~ = (1, 2, 3). from appendix b, we get that the operator h written on the lattice
becomes

h =

xn1,n2,n3= n

xj=1(i

(~na, t)(0j) [(~na + a, t)  (~na  a, t)]
(~na, t)(0)(~na, t)o ,

(32)

where a is the distance between the nearest sites in each space direction. the space point ~x on

the lattice is written as: ~x = ~na. n is the total number of space sites in each direction. for
simplicity we take to be n even.

operator k in expression (1) is: k = h  q, where  is the chemical potential and q is

the total electric charge operator. the discrete expression of q is

n

q = a3

xn1,n2,n3= n

(~na, t)(~na, t).

(33)

imposing the space periodic boundary condition for the fermionic eld operators, their

fourier decompositions are

where  = 1, 2, 3, 4 and l = n a
(~x, t) satisfy
the anti-commutation relations (12) and (13) which imply that the fourier components of the
fermionic eld operators obey the relations:

and

{ (

(35)

that are identical to relations (3), the necessary algebra to apply the method of charret et al..

in momentum space, operator k is written as

 .

sin(cid:16) 

we have an implicit sum over j in the o-diagonal elements of matrix r and 1l is the identity
matrix of dimension 22. due to the anti-commutation relations (35) we have that [k~l, k~k] = 0.
therefore, the grand canonical partition function of the model becomes

z() =

(40)

where t r~l means that the trace is calculated for xed ~l. we should notice that the operator

where the diagonal matrix d is

l li. the new fermionic eld operators  = p  and  = p1 also preserves

the function z() written in terms of the new fermionic eld operators has the same form
as the r.h.s. of eq.(22). following similar steps, we get the helmholtz free energy for the model

on the lattice, that is,

w() = 2

(45)

in the limit a  0 the function w() agrees with the result of reference [10] and is equal to
twice the result (30). here as well in the usual lattice calculation with fermions, the doubling
problem is lifted by including the wilson term

in hamiltonian (31) and r is the wilsons constant.

4 conclusions

recently charret et al. proposed a new way to calculate the coecients of the high temperature
expansion of the grand canonical partition function z() of any self-interacting fermionic model
in d-dimension (d  1)[13]. to apply this method to calculate these coecients, it is enough to
write the second quantization expression of the hamiltonian and a conserved operator in terms
of operators that satisfy the anti-commutation relations (3). in this approach, at each order n
of the high temperature expansion of the function z(), the calculation of the coecients is
reduced to get the co-factors of a matrix with commuting entries (see matrix a in eqs. (7) and

11

(8)). for a xed number of sites on the lattice, all the mathematical objects in the calculation
are well-dened. this approach avoids to calculate the fermionic path integral of z().

we applied the method of charret et al. to the free dirac fermion by rst expanding it in

the basis of the eigenstates of energy of the free fermions. the hamiltonian and the total electric
charge operators (eqs.(14) and (18) respectively) include the respective vacuum contribution.
result (30) gives two divergent terms to the helmholtz free energy w(): the vacuum energy
and the electric charge of the vacuum. this last divergent term does not appear when we do
the calculation via the usual path integral approach[3], while the -dependent terms in w()
are identical in both methods. in the path integral calculation[3] divergent terms that are 
and -independent are dropped out. this does not happens in the present approach.

since the calculation of fermionic lattice models are an important tool, we also applied the
approach of charret et al. to a naive version of the free dirac fermion on the lattice[10]. in

this case we also get the doubling problem that is lifted by the wilson term, as happens in the
usual fermion lattice calculations.

in summary, we can arm that the method of charretet al. can also be applied to continuous
fermionic models. it is an analytical approach that allows without ambiguity to calculate all
terms of the function z() for the free dirac fermion, including the divergent terms coming
from the vacuum contribution. the next step is to study in this approach the renormalization
scheme associated to physical quantities for fermionic models with self-interacting terms.

we have the following dictionary between the continous to the discrete representations of

the formulae:

where ~x = ~na, ~x = ~ma with ~n = (n1, n2, n3) and ~m = (m1, m2, m3) respectively.

finally, the rst derivative dened on the lattice is dened as[10]

i(~x, t)
