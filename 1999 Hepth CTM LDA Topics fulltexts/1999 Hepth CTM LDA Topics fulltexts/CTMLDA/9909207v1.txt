we put forward the rst-ever local, covariant, physically motivated lagrangian of quantum-
electrodynamic phenomena such that: (i) feynman diagrams are nite and equal the diagrams of
qed but with regularized propagators.
(iii) s-matrix
relates only physical particles, is unitary and lorentz-invariant, and conserves charge and total
four-momentum.

(ii) n-point green functions are causal.

i. introduction

quantitative predictions about quantum-electrodynamic phenomena implied by the qed lagrangian are computed
using the feynman rules, a regularization method to circumvent ultraviolet divergencies, and a renormalization
scheme. regularization method results in a set of regularized qed n-point green functions; a suitable limiting
procedure (a renormalization scheme) then leads to physically sensible results that do not depend on the particular
regularization method used. but no known set of regularized qed n-point green functions can be regarded as a
physically plausible description (model) of quantum-electrodynamic phenomena since each disregards some of the
basic tenets of conventional physics (e.g., by lacking a lagrangian, by being non-covariant, by introducing particles
with wrong metric or statistics. . . ). so the predictions of qed can presently only be derived via a model that is
not physically plausible; for a history of, and comments on this basic problem see, e.g., [1]. dirac [2] believed that
removal of this conceptual inconsistency may lead to an important advance in eld theories. we will show how this
inconsistency can be removed by a new, physically motivated modication of the qed lagrangian.

the ultraviolet divergences in the perturbative calculations of qed are due to the inadequate description of ultra-
high-energy phenomena by the qed lagrangian. as contemporary theories take for granted that fundamental
interactions are described by a lagrangian, we will modify the qed lagrangian in such a way that the ultraviolet
divergences disappear. the question is how to modify the qed lagrangian so that the resulting regularized qed is
physically plausible.

gupta [3] has shown already in 1952 that one can modify the qed lagrangian so that the new lagrangian describes
qed regularized by certain pauli-villars method. and twenty years later t hooft and veltman [4] introduced
a variant of pauli-villars methods for regularizing propagators (hv-method) that (i) requires only an exceedingly
simple modication of the initial lagrangian, and (ii) is very suitable for proving the unitarity and causality of the
regularized model. unfortunately both methods introduce unphysical particles with wrong metric or statistics. to
get rid of this serious conceptual deciency, we will generalize the hv-method.

it is the purpose of this letter to construct by a generalized hv-method the rst-ever model of quantum-
electrodynamic phenomena that is physically plausible (pp-model for short) in the following sense: (i) the model
is dened as specied by t hooft and veltman [4] in a continuous, four-dimensional space-time by a local, covariant
lagrangian that is a physically motivated modication of the qed lagrangian. (ii) its feynman diagrams are nite
and equal the diagrams of qed but with regularized propagators. (iii) its n-point green functions are causal. (iv) its
s-matrix is unitary, lorentz-invariant, charge and total four-momentum conserving, and relating only physical par-
ticles. (v) all of its constants are measurable in principle; there are no auxiliary parameters. (vi) for certain values
of these constants, the qed propagators are the same kind of low-energy approximations to their regularizations as
they are in certain variants of the pauli-villars method [5]. thus, a nite-cuto, pauli-villars, dimensional, or lattice
regularization of qed does not result in a pp-model.

ii. covariant regulators without singularities

as in the hv-method to each additional singularity of a regularized feynman propagator corresponds an additional
particle [4], we will rst show how we can covariantly regularize feynman propagators so that they do not acquire
additional singularities and have the kallen-lehman representation used in proving causality and unitarity [4,6].
regarding metric and other conventions we follow refs. [4,6]; in particular, a four-vector k = (~k, ik0), and k2 
~k  ~k  (k0)2.

consider a covariantly regularized spin 0 feynman propagator, say, f (x) whose space-time fourier transform

(2)4igf (k) = (k2 + m2  i)1 + (k2  i)

(1)

(3)

(4)

(5)

where: (a) the regulator (z) is an analytic function of complex variable z with a nite discontinuity somewhere
across the negative real axis; (b) |(z + m2)1 + (z)| = o(|z|r), r > 1, as |z|  ; (c) (z) is real if z > 0 and
z = 0; (d) (z) depends on some constant  so that for any   0 > 0 it has properties (a) to (c), and, as   ,
(2)

for any z0 > 0 .

sup

z0,z=0|(z)|  0 and

sup
|z|<z0 |(z)|  0

as a consequence, the spin 0 propagator provides such a low-energy approximation to its regularization (1) as required
in certain variants of pauli-villars method [5].

using cauchys integral formula we can conclude that the covariant regularization (1) of the spin 0 feynman

propagator admits the kallen-lehman representation

with

(2)4igf (k) =z 

0

(s)

k2 + s  i

ds

(s) = (s  m2) + (2i)1 lim

y0

[(s  iy)  (s + iy)] ,

s, y > 0. note that (s) is real, (s) = o(sr) as s  , and

z 

0

sm(s) ds = 0

for m = 0, 1, . . . < r  1 .

so we can decompose the regularized spin 0 propagator f (x) into positive and negative energy parts: f (x) =
(x0)+(x) + (x0)(x) [4].
the function i(2)4(2  m2 + )n(k2 + m2  i)1(k2 + 2  i + )n,  > m, n = 1, 2, . . ., is an
example of a covariantly regularized spin 0 feynman propagator that satises the above conditions with r = n/2 + 1.
unfortunately, we cannot use such propagators for a physically plausible regularization of qed since we do not know
how to construct the corresponding local lagrangians.

a regulator that has the kallen-lehman representation is a generalization of the pauli-villars regulator that has
a continuous mass spectrum. thus, to use such regulators to construct a pp-model, we have to extend the t hooft-
veltman construction of lagrangians in hv-method [4] to an innite number of auxilliary elds. to provide an
example of how this is done, we will present a local, covariant lagrangian whose propagators for interacting elds can
be taken as spin 1 and spin 1
2 propagators regularized so that they acquire no additional singularities and have the
kallen-lehman representation.

iii. lagrangian that regularizes qed propagators

we will consider qed with massive photons in unitary gauge to avoid unphysical photons. its lagrangian reads

lqed =  1

4 (a  a)2  1

2 2a2  (

  + m) + ie a + aj + je + je ,

(6)

where j(x), je(x), and je(x) are four-vector and bispinor source elds, and the photon mass  is the regulator of
infrared divergencies [4,6,7]. the feynman propagators for the four-vector eld a(x) and for the bispinor eld (x)
are:

2

 i(2)4  + 2kk
k2 + 2  i

,

i(2)4 ik + m
k2 + m2  i

.

(7)

one can modify the qed lagrangian (6) so that the propagators for a and  elds are such regularizations of
propagators (7) that have no additional singularities. take, for example, the following real-valued, local, covariant
lagrangian:

with

ltr = l1  l1/2 + ie a + aj + je + je

a(x) z d4pf (p2)(x, p) ,

(x) z d4pf (p2)1/2(x, p) ,



where: (x, p) and 
valued function of x and p; 2a

(x, p) are four-vector-valued functions of two four-vectors x and p; 1/2(x, p) is a bispinor-
1/24; t(p2) and f (p2) are real-valued functions of real

 b  a(b)  (a)b; 1/2  
p2, r d4pf 2(p2) = 1; q1, s1, q1/2, s1/2, and  are real constants.
lagrangian ltr is constructed by modifying lqed on the analogy of hv-method [4]: (i) we introduced an innite
number of four-vector and bispinor elds of x that have a continuous index p, namely (x, p), 
(x, p), and 1/2(x, p).
(ii) we replaced the free part of lqed with the free lagrangian of these elds, l1l1/2, which is of the rst order in
 and has a nondiagonal mass matrix. (iii) in the interaction and source terms of lqed, we replaced the elds a(x)
and (x) with weighted integrals (8d) of (x, p) and 1/2(x, p) over the continuous index p. we could do without
(x, p) which we introduced solely to be able to use the same functions t(p2) and f (p2) in
the four-vector function 
l1 and l1/2.
the euler-lagrange equations of ltr resemble the boltzmann integro-dierential transport equation, which can
better model rapidly varying, ultra-high-energy, macroscopic uid phenomena than the dierential equations of
motion of uid dynamics. (to this end it uses an innite number of elds to take some account of the underlying
microscopic behaviour.) such euler-lagrange equations may be regarded as classical transport equations of motion for
the one-particle distribution of some innitesimal entities, such as x-ons surmised to underly all physical phenomena
by feynman [8]; for details see [9]. these facts are the physical motivation for the type of lagrangian we constructed.
using the euler-lagrange equations of ltr and proceeding as in ref. [9], we calculate the dependence of (x, p)
(x, p) on j(x), and of 1/2(x, p) on je(x). thereby we can infer that the feynman propagator for the

and 
four-vector eld a(x) dened by (8d) equals

where k2 has to be replaced everywhere with k2  i, by the feynman prescription.

if functions t(p2) and f (p2) are such that

z

f 2(y)t(y)|y/t(y)|l+1dy = 0

for l = 0,1, . . . ,n, then for complex values of k as |k2|  :

k2 +e2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = o(|k2|(1n)/2) ,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)eg1/2 em  ik

k2 + em2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = o(|k2|n/2) .

for any 2, m2 and integer n, there exist functions f (p2) and t(p2), and constants s1, s1/2, q1, q1/2, and 0 > 0
such that the propagators (9) and (12) with  > 0 are regularizations of spin 1 and spin 1
2 propagators (7) such
that: (i) they have properties analogous to those of propagator (1), and (ii) there is a positive constant k2
0 such that
for all k2  2k2
0 the functions imn(k2), eg1/2(k2), e(k2), eg1(k2), and em(k2) are real. (to show this, we considered
the case where the function t(z)/z takes only a nite number of real values of approximately the same magnitude.)
in such a case: (i) the constants s1, s1/2, q1, and q1/2 are such that

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

e2(2) = 2 ,
eg1/2(2) = 1 + de2(k2 = 2)/dk2 ,

em2(m2) = m2 ,
eg1(m2) = 1 + dem2(k2 = m2)/dk2 .

so the propagators (9) and (12) have poles at k2 = 2 and k2 = m2, where their behaviour is given by the spin
1 and spin 1
2 propagators (7) with  = 0. (ii) the dierence between spin 1 propagator and propagator (9) depends
on the value of  so that it satises relations analogous to (2); and the same goes for spin 1
2 propagators. (iii) the
propagators (9) and (12) are analytic functions of k2 that (a) are not continuous everywhere across the negative
real axis, (b) have no additional singularities to those of spin 1 and spin 1
2 propagators (7), and (c) satisfy relations
(15). for any integer n  3, their kallen-lehman integral representations are superconvergent: in x-space we can
decompose the feynman propagators (9) and (12) into positive and negative energy parts without contact terms [4].

iv. physically plausible lagrangian-based regularization of qed

to obtain a model of quantum-electrodynamic phenomena based on the lagrangian ltr (trqed), we use the
t hooft-veltman denition of a quantum eld theory in terms of feynman diagrams corresponding to ltr. as the
lagrangian ltr has the same interaction and source terms as the qed lagrangian lqed, we obtain the n-point green
functions and corresponding s-matrix elements of trqed expressed in terms of qed diagrams with the spin 1 and
spin 1
2 propagators (7) replaced with their regularizations (9) and (12), whereas the vertices are the same as in qed,
i.e., (2)4; so all diagrams are nite.

there exist functions f (p2) and t(p2), and constants s1, s1/2, q1, q1/2, and  such that trqed has the following
properties: (i) its lagrangian may be regarded as a physically motivated modication of qed lagrangian. (ii) the
propagators (9) and (12) have no additional singularities and admit the kallen-lehman representation. so s-matrix
relates only physical particles: electrons, positrons, and photons. (iii) n-point green functions are causal and the
corresponding s-matrix is unitary to any order in the ne structure constant. to show this we may follow the t hooft-
veltman proof for the hv-method [4]. (iv) s-matrix is charge and total four-momentum conserving since its vertices
are such. (v) s-matrix is lorentz-invariant, since the propagators (9) and (12) commute with lorentz transformations
and the vertices are lorentz-invariant. (vi) in the asymptote   , its propagators (9) and (12) behave by (2) the
same way as required of the pauli-villarsregularized spin 1 and spin 1
2 propagators when their auxiliary masses tend
to innity in renormalization [5]. we expect, therefore, that we can compute by renormalization the renormalized
n-point green functions of qed with massless photons from the n-point green functions of trqed by choosing
an appropriate dependence of e, s1, s1/2, q1, and q1/2 on , and then limiting    and the renormalized photon
mass to zero. therefore, such trqed is a pp-model, and can be regarded as a physically plausible lagrangian-based
regularization of qed.

v. comments

by giving an example of a physically plausible, lagrangian-based regularization of qed, we have shown, for the
rst time as far as we know, that one can regularize qed in accordance with the basic tenets of theoretical physics
by suitably modifying the free part of qed lagrangian. as we mentioned before, the physical motivation for such
modication has been the feynman surmise about x-ons, and the boltzmann improvement on uid dynamics by the
transport theory based on his equation.

the need for a regularization of qed that results in a physically plausible model was felt very strongly by the
founders of qed, dirac and heisenberg, already some sixty-ve years ago [1]. but neither they nor their contem-
poraries succeded in getting rid of the ultraviolet divergencies by a physicaly motivated modication of the qed
lagrangian. in the late 1940s, however, tomonaga, schwinger and feynman solved the problem of qed ultraviolet
divergencies through renormalizationa solution which does not require regularization to be physically plausible,
and removes all parameters characteristic of regularization. as they obtained spectacularly succesful formulas for
quantum-electrodynamic phenomena, the problem of nding a physically plausible, lagrangian-based regularization
of qed was not so urgent any more. as there had been no progress whatsoever towards a solution of this prob-
lem, it mainly came to be considered as practically unsolvable [1]; those who hoped otherwise were often considered
irrational, as isham, salam, and strathdee [10] complained twenty-ve years later. thus nowadays, as far as we
know, no quantum-eld theorist, excepting the string theorist, pays much attention to this problem, which many
of the preceding generationse.g., dirac, heisenberg, landau, pauli, and salam, to mention somestill hoped to
be solved somehow someday [1]. the string theorists, however, abandon one of the basic premises of conventional
physics, the four-dimensionality of space-time. in this letter we have shown that such drastic steps may be avoided
when modifying qed lagrangian to get rid of ultraviolet divergencies. but the question remains which modication
of the type considered is the most appropriate for better describing quantum-electrodynamic phenomena at higher
energies than the conventional qed.

authors greatly appreciate discussions with m. poljsak and b. bajc and their suggestions.
