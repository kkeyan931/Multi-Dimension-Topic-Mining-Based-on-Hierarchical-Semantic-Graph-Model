abstract

in this paper we study various aspects of classical solutions to the ane toda
equations on a half-line with integrable boundary conditions. we begin by nding
conditions that the theory has a stable vacuum by nding a bogomolny bound on
the energy, and analysing the possible singularities of the eld at the boundary.
using these constraints and extensive numerical investigations we classify the vacuum
congurations and reection factors for a(1)

r toda theories up to r = 5.

introduction

the study of (1 + 1)-dimensional integrable theories with boundaries is of interest, not
only because many of the physical systems which they model have such boundaries, but
also because of the more detailed algebraic structure which they introduce [1, 2]. besides
the bulk s-matrix, a reection factor k is needed to describe the scattering of particles
o the boundary. in a similar way to the case of the bulk s-matrices [3], various algebraic
constraints allow postulates to be made for the exact forms of these reection matrices
[49]. one way these conjectures can then be checked is by using perturbation theory [10
12]. however, before this is possible we must rst split the eld into quantum uctuations
and a classical background eld conguration. the background eld conguration must
satisfy one of the integrable boundary conditions. unlike in the bulk, this can often only
be achieved by a non-trivial solution which can be surprisingly tricky to nd. indeed such
a lowest-energy background solution may not even exist since the boundary potential may
destabilise a theory which is perfectly stable in the bulk.

in this paper we shall look at one class of such models which have been recently studied
 the real coupling ane toda theories [13]. some results on classical backgrounds and
semi-classical scattering solutions have already been obtained in a number of special cases
[1417]. here we present a more detailed study of such solutions, and an intriguingly
complex picture emerges.

there is one toda theory for each ane kac-moody algebra g. the equation of motion

is

 +

m2


r

xi=0

niiei = 0.

(1.1)

here we have used the notation that i for i = 1 to r are the simple roots of g, the nite
lie algebra associated to g, and 0 =  where  is the highest root of g (for untwisted
algebras). the ni are the marks; integers such that

0 +

r

xi=1

nii = 0.

(1.2)

also we have dened r to be the rank of g and introduced m the mass parameter, and
 the coupling constant of the theory. from now on we shall arrange for m =  = 1 for
convenience. for the theory dened on the whole line the bulk energy

e = z 



dx 1

(x)2 +

(1.3)

is manifestly positive for real coupling constant. however we must modify this formula if
we wish to consider the theory on the half-line, by restricting the above integral to the

1

physical region x  0 and adding a boundary potential term. thus the energy for the
boundary theory becomes

e = z 0

ni(ei  1)! + vb()|x=0.

(1.4)

by varying this action, it can easily be shown that this corresponds to a theory with
boundary condition

x = vb


.

(1.5)

it has been shown that to preserve the integrability of the theory we must take the
potential to have the form [14, 1820]

vb() = 2

ais 2ni

2
i

r

xi=0

ei/2

(1.6)

where the constants ai must either all vanish (neumann boundary conditions) or obey
a number of restrictions which are given in [18]. for simply laced theories we have that
ai = 1.

an important point is that ai can be positive as well as negative, and so whilst the
theory in the bulk has positive energy, it is not clear whether the boundary potential term
can destabilise the theory. to get a large negative boundary contribution to the energy
we need that i   becomes large, and this in turn produces a positive contribution to the
gradient terms in the energy. which of these two competing factors wins is determined by
the value of ai. in this paper we determine that one needs

ai  1

(1.7)

for the positive bulk energy to win out and for the theory to have energy bounded below
our approach to nding this result will be based on generalising the stability argument
for the sinh-gordon model given in [15] which was based on a bogomolny-like bound. we
review this argument and explicitly extend it to a(1)
in section two of the paper. then
2
in section three, we nd an implicit bogomolny form of the energy for all the other toda
theories, and use this together with an analysis of the possible singularity structure of the
solution at the boundary to prove the result (1.7).

in the next section of the paper we embark on a detailed study of classical vacuum
solutions to the a(1)
r toda theories. this continues and renes the analysis in terms of tau
functions given in [16]. a general analysis of the equations, incorporating the singularity
analysis of section three, is considered and a complete classication of vacuum solutions
for dierent boundary conditions is given for a(1)
r up to r = 5. some of the solutions in

2

[16] are excluded because of singularities in the physical region x < 0, whilst a number of
new exceptional solutions are found.

in section ve we consider the scattering solutions around the new vacuum solutions
r up to r = 5 is given.

we have found. again a complete classication of k matrices for a(1)
the paper concludes with some conclusions.

2 the energy on the half-line for the sinh-gordon theory and

a(1)

2 toda theory

for the sinh-gordon model the parameters ai appearing in the boundary potential (1.6)
are known to be unconstrained by integrability. however, if we would like the hamiltonian
describing the theory on the half-line (1.4) to have energies bounded from below, we must
have that ai  1 as shown in [15]. this result relied on being able to write the energy for
the sinh-gordon theory in a bogomolny form. explicitly we have that the energy

e = z 0

(t)2 + (e

2e/2 + 2e/2)2(cid:19)

the integral is non-negative, as is the boundary term if ai  1. furthermore we can

show that this condition is necessary for stability by taking the eld to be of the form

e/2 =

1 + de2x
1  de2x

(2.4)

where d is a constant which must be taken to be less than one for the solution to be
non-singular in the region x < 0. this is the analytic continuation of the sine-gordon kink
to the real coupling theory, and it satises the bogomolny equation

2e/2 + 2e/2 = 0

x 

(2.5)

so that the only contributions to the energy come from the boundary terms at x = 0 in
(2.3). by choosing the constant d to be close to one, we can take the eld (0, t) to be

3

as large as we like at the boundary, and hence take the energy to be as negative as we
like if (a1  1) > 0. similarly we can show that that a0  1 is necessary for stability by
considering the solution obtained by taking    in the above.

we would like to generalise this result to toda theories based on other algebras by

nding a bogomolny-like form

e = z 0

for the energy in these cases too. comparing this to (2.1), we see that we can write the
energy in this form provided that

so that we must have the integrability condition

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

as usual, a solution of the bogomolny equations xi = wi will automatically be
a (static) solution to the toda eld equations which are the equations for the (1 + 0)-
dimensional toda molecule:

 xx +

m


r

xi=0

niiei = 0.

(2.11)

the integrability of the toda molecule can be used to show that any solution to these
r second order equations must also satisfy r rst order equations. the toda molecule
describe a nite (in fact r) degrees of freedom, and integrability can be taken in the strict
liouville sense; that is there exist r conserved quantities which poisson-commute with each
other. note that now x plays the role of time in this system. by using the equation of
motion (2.11) to eliminate higher derivatives, the conserved quantities which we label hi
can be written as functions of i and the momenta pi = xi. thus we have

hi(i, pi) = i.

(2.12)

4

we shall be interested in solutions for which i, pi  0 as the time x  , since
these are the solutions which will have nite energy in the (1 + 1) toda system. for such
solutions i = hi(0, 0). for instance one of the conserved charges is the energy for the
(1 + 0) system

ni(ei  1) = 0.

(2.13)

together with the other r 1 equations from conserved charges, we have r equations which
can be used to solve for pi in terms of the i. we suggestively write these solutions as

pi = xi = wi().

(2.14)

for these equations to satisfy the criteria to be bogomolny equations for the toda system
we need to show that the conditions (2.8) and (2.10) hold. the rst condition follows
immediately from (2.14) and (2.13). the second condition follows from a result in classical
mechanics that any equations derived from poisson commuting quantities must also be
poisson commuting (see for instance [21]). thus we must have that

{pi  wi, pj  wj} =

wj
i 

wi
j

= 0.

(2.15)

this procedure can be explicitly performed in the case of the ane toda theory based

on the algebra a(1)

2 . for this case it is convenient to use variables

ui = ei
i = i  x

(2.16)

(2.17)

where as usual i are the highest weights of the two fundamental representations of a2 (i.e.
the 3 and the 3). in terms of these variables the two conserved quantities can be written

h1 = 2

these equations can be easily solved for 1 and 2 as follows

w = 2s (1 + u1 + u2)3

(2.22)

from the bogomolny argument it now follows that the energy of any eld conguration on

3 bogomolny equations and stability for other ane toda

theories on the half-line

2 and a(1)

let us now proceed to the cases of other algebras. in principle we could follow the same
steps as for a(1)
1 but in practice we are unable to invert the conserved quantities
to nd explicit relations between for the momenta in terms of the elds . however, we
can use our knowledge of (analytically continued) static solutions to the toda equations
to circumvent this diculty. any static solution must necessarily obey the conservation
laws for the toda molecule, and so in turn must satisfy the bogomolny equations (2.14),
and saturate the bogomolny bound. it follows that the energy density for such a solution
can be written is a total derivative of some function w . but it has been known for some
time in the context of imaginary coupling toda theories that this is indeed the case, and
the explicit formula for w is given in terms of tau functions as

w = 2

(3.1)

where

(3.2)

some clarifying remarks about the above formulae are in order. first, note that the
equation (3.2) cannot completely specify the r + 1 tau functions, since there are only r
components of ; indeed we can send

where

i  i(f (x, t))mi

(3.3)

(3.4)

without aecting (3.2). this ambiguity is partially removed by xing a particular form of
the resulting equations of motion for the tau functions;

(3.5)

where kij = 2i  j/2
j is the extended cartan matrix. we are still free to do a trans-
formation of the form (3.3) for any f that satises  ln(f ) = 0. for time independent
solutions this implies that

f = eax+b

(3.6)

which only adds an unimportant constant to w . we complete the gauge xing by de-
manding that   1 as x  . with this choice of tau functions all the static solutions
to the real toda equations can be described in terms of r parameters, one real parameter
for each node on the (non-extended) dynkin diagram corresponding to a real fundamental
representation, and one complex parameter for each pair of complex conjugate nodes. one
can now consider the map between the parameters in the tau functions and the value of
the corresponding static soliton r-component eld  on the boundary which is obtained by
putting x = 0 in (3.2). we shall simply assume that imposing the condition that the eld
is free of singularities in the physical region and and tends to zero as x   renders this
map invertible so that we can write the parameters in terms of the values of the elds of
the corresponding solitons at x = 0. in this way we can view w as a function of  as we
did for a(1)
1 . with this in mind, we can write the energy on the half-line of any
eld conguration in the form (2.6) so that the energy is bounded below by

2 and a(1)

e  ebound = w ()|x=0  w ()|x= + vb()|x=0

(3.7)

i.e. the energy of the static soliton conguration with a value of  that coincides with that
of our arbitrary solution at x = 0, at some point in time.

7

to prove stability of toda theory on the half-line, we must show that the right hand

side of (3.7) is bounded from below. this can be written

ebound = 2

(3.8)

where kij = 2i  j/2
j is the extended cartan matrix, and we have used that w ()|x=
vanishes since i (x)  0 as x  . if the energy is not bounded below, we can tune the
parameters dening the tau functions to make ebound arbitrarily negative. navely this can
occur two ways: either one of the tau functions become very large, or else becomes zero.
in fact the rst possibility never arises, since if one tunes the parameters to make the tau
function large, the quotients appearing in ebound tend to a nite limit. so if the energy is
unbounded we must have a soliton solution with one or more tau function vanishing at the
boundary and for which ebound = .

our approach therefore is to consider the function ebound for such soliton solutions with
singularities at the boundary, and determine whether the residue of the pole in x is positive
(corresponding to innite positive energy or negative). if the residue is always positive (or
zero) then ebound must be bounded below. to analyse the behaviour near the origin take

i = aixyi + o(xyi+1)

(3.9)

and we know that yi  0 and ai 6= 0 for all i. let s  0, 1, ...r be the set of i for which
yi > 0, i.e. for which the corresponding tau function i vanishes at x = 0. for i  s the
equation of motion (3.5) contains a term of the form x2yi2. comparing coecients we
nd that for

kijyj = 2.

(3.10)

(3.11)

note that the second equation implies that not all the tau functions can vanish simultane-
ously, or in other words s 6= {0, 1, ...r} since then we could write

ni

2i  j

2
j

0 = xi,j

yj = xi,j

nikijyj = 2xi

ni = 2h

(3.12)

which is clearly not true. also from both equations we see that for i  s, then for x close
to 0,

ei = yj

kij

r

(ajxyj )kij =

i  ai
2

2yi
i ! + o(1)
2

(3.14)

where we have used that ei > 0 and x < 0 to identify the correct sign for the last term.
thus we see that ebound will be bounded below if and only if

ai  1,
generalising the result we found explicitly for a(1)
to all other ane algebras, since
(3.11) implies we can always arrange yi = 1 by arranging that only i vanishes. note that
this result implies that all simply-laced toda theories with integrable boundary conditions
are stable, although those with ai = 1 are only marginally so.

4 vacuum soliton solutions to the toda eld equations

r

in this section we elaborate on the results in [15, 16] looking for static solutions to the a(1)
toda equations which satisfy integrable boundary equations. a large class of solutions
was found in [16] and subsequently discussed in [17]. these solutions typically involved
pairs of analytically continued solitons [22]. however, the analysis could not determine
whether solutions (beyond those containing a single pair of solitons) had any singularities
in the physical region x < 0, which would render them unacceptable since such solutions
have innite energy. nor was it clear whether there were other solutions to the equations,
potentially with lower energy and therefore the true vacuum solutions. here we carry the
analysis a little further, utilising the singularity analysis of the previous section. extensive
numerical analysis indicates that generally the vacuum solutions of [16] with more than
one pair of constituent solitons do develop singularities in the physical region and so are
unacceptable. moreover, we shall see that even for critical values of the soliton parameters
where it is possible to place such singularities on the boundary, we cannot obtain acceptable
vacuum solutions. however a number of exceptional solutions are found which provide
acceptable vacuum congurations for a(1)

r up to r = 5.

let us recall some of the notation of [16]. in the language of the tau-functions introduced
in the last section, the boundary conditions can be conveniently written (specialising to
the a(1)

series of ane toda theories where ni = 1 and 2

i = 2)

r

where

i

+ aiei/2 = c

c =   0

(4.1)

using this denition of c, the equations of motion imply, at the boundary x = 0,

2

i
i  i + 2ci  (c 2  1)i = 0

i 

which simplies in the static case to

i  2ci + (c 2  1)i|x=0 = 0.

(4.3)

(4.4)

however this equation only contains the squares of the coecients ai and so we no longer
know which boundary conditions a given solution of this will obey. we will nd that it is
possible to recover this information later.

the parameter c turns out to be proportional to the energy of the eld by

e = 2

nic.

r

xi=0

(4.5)

it is now desirable to try to nd the lowest energy (i.e. highest c) static background
solutions to these equations. these will depend, in general, on the boundary conditions
imposed. it is known that there are solutions to the equations which consist of solitonic
solutions analytically continued from the imaginary-coupling theory [22, 16]. the tau func-
tions for an n-soliton solution can be written as:

j(x, t) =

1

x1=0

...

1

xn =0

exp


n

xp=1

p(p + ln apj) + x1pqn

pq ln a(apaq)
 .

(4.6)

here, p = p(x  vpt) + p. we have the mass-shell condition 2(1  v2
ap , which in
the static case implies  = map since we need the asymptotic form i  1 as x  . for
r , the masses map = 2sin( ap
a(1)
r+1). later it is useful to take p = ln(d) + i
where d is referred to as the position of the soliton.

r+1) and  =exp( 2i

p) = m2

the interactions between solitons are given by the interaction constants

a(apaq) = 

(p  q)2  (pvp  qvq)2  4 sin2 
(p + q)2  (pvp + qvq)2  4 sin2 

r+1(ap  aq)
r+1(ap + aq)

.

(4.7)

it is worth noting that when we interact one soliton with another of the same type and
velocity, we nd that the interaction constant a(apaq) vanishes. hence in the static case it
is only possible to have at most one of each type of soliton in a background solution.

it is convenient to make the change of basis

tkkj

j = xk

10

(4.8)

which splits the tau functions up into charge sectors tk. this gives us a similar equation
to before but now for tk:

t k  2ct k + (c 2  1)tk = 0

(4.9)

at x = 0. we now have a simpler set of equations: a soliton of type a resides in ta whilst
its interaction with another soliton b resides in ta+b and so on.

it is required that the function  be real everywhere on the interval (, 0]. thus
the tau functions must be real and non-negative on this interval. reality imposes the
condition that each soliton must appear with its conjugate, i.e. type a with type r + 1 a.
the exception to this is where we have a middle soliton. the middle soliton has a = r+1
2
when r is odd, and hence if we take  = 0,  we obtain a real tau function. however the
restriction imposed by insisting that the tau function be non-negative is more subtle and
will be considered case by case below. let us look at possible background congurations
in turn.

4.1  = 0

looking at the boundary conditions (4.1) and remembering (1.2), it is clear that the
solution  = 0 is only valid when

0 =

r

xi=0

aii.

(4.10)

this is clearly only true when all of the ai are the same sign. in addition the value of c
is found to be 1 for the + + ..+ and   .. boundary conditions respectively. we use
the notation for the boundary conditions where the signs of the parameters ai are listed
in turn.

4.2 single middle soliton

in the case r = odd, there is a self-conjugate soliton associated with the central spot of the
dynkin diagram, i.e. of type a = r+1
2 . if we consider a background conguration consisting
only of such a static soliton, we nd;

j = 1 + (1)jde2x

(4.11)

where we have taken  = 0 for simplicity ( =  merely swaps the role of the even and
odd tau functions). it is apparent from this equation that we must take d  1 in order
that none of the tau functions are negative in the physical region.

since

ei =

i1i+1

 2
i

,

11

(4.12)

the boundary conditions imply that

1  (1)jde2x

1 + (1)jde2x = aj (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1  (1)jde2x

1 + (1)jde2x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(4.13)

note that here we have used the fact that the energy of such a solution is given by c =
m  1 = 1. for d < 1, the modulus sign is irrelevant and we obtain the result that all
the ai must be positive. in the special case d = 1, all the odd tau functions vanish at the
boundary. consider a vanishing tau function, j. since we can write the j  1 and j + 1
boundary conditions as

and

j1
j1

j+1
j+1

c 

c 

= aj1

= aj+1

jj2

jj+2

1
j1

1

j+1

(4.14)

(4.15)

respectively, then it is clear that in this case we can take aj1 and aj+1 to be of arbitrary
sign. this gives us a variety of consistent boundary conditions. it is worth noting also
that since j < 0 and j > 0 for x near to but below 0, then the boundary condition
ajei/2 = c 
> 0 for x  0 and so if j vanishes at x = 0 then aj = 1. hence when
d = 1, we can t boundary conditions of the form a + a + a + a + .. where a denotes
an arbitrary choice of sign. note that taking instead  =  allows us to t the boundary
conditions of the form + a + a + a + ...

4.3 two soliton solutions

the single middle soliton was something of a special case:
let us now consider the case
where we have a soliton, type a, and its conjugate, type a = r + 1  a. then the tau
functions become;

i = 1 + 2d cos(cid:18) +

2ia

r + 1(cid:19) emax + a(aa)d2e2max.

(4.16)

in this case it can readily be shown (using the equation for the highest occupied charge
sector) that there are two solutions c = ma  1. one can show that the lower energy
solution c+ has singularities in the physical region so we require the parity inverse solution
c [16]. there is also a specic value of d corresponding to this solution (determined by
the zero charge sector) which is given by d = 2

.

2+ma

working with the boundary conditions (4.1) as before it can be shown that the coe-

cients ai are given by

ai = sign cos  

2

+

(i + 1)a

r + 1 ! cos  

2

+

r + 1 !! .
(i  1)a

(4.17)

note that a shift of the parameter  by 2/(r +1) merely cyclically permutes the boundary
conditions obeyed. however, by choosing  so that cos( 
r+1) = 0 we can ensure that
j  0 as x  0. so as before this allows us to take the signs of aj1 and aj+1 to be
arbitrary. therefore there are a number of boundary conditions consistent with a two-
soliton solution which is singular at the boundary.

2 + ja

4.4 multi-soliton solutions

let us rst consider the case developed in [16] where the highest charge sector occupied
qmax = pap  r+1
2 . we shall refer to this case as having no overlapping of the charge-
sectors, i.e. the interaction term involving all the solitons ap always resides alone in the
qmax charge sector. this leads to the expressions for c and dp:

c =

n

xp=0

map  1

dp = yr6=p

mar + map
|mar  map|

2

2  map

(4.18)

(4.19)

excepting that when r is odd we are only allowed the c solution.

extensive numerical work with 3, 4, and 5 soliton solutions suggests that, under this
regime, the only solutions which are non-zero in the region (, 0) occur when a maximal
number of tau functions vanish at the boundary x = 0. consider a solution in which two or
more consecutive tau functions vanish at the origin. in the language of section three, this
means that the s contains at least two neighbouring nodes. let us rewrite the conditions
(3.10) and (3.11) for the special case of a(1)

theory. these give

r

2yi  yi+1  yi1 = 2
= yi.

ai1ai+1

a2
i

(4.20)

(4.21)

now in the case where s contains at least two consecutive nodes it follows immediately
from (4.20) that yi, the order of zero of i at x = 0 must be greater than one. however,
using (4.20) we see that for i  s, both sides of the boundary condition (4.1)

c 

i
i

= ais i1i+1

 2
i

(4.22)

go as 1/x as x  0. hence, since c (the energy) is nite, the coecients of these leading
order terms must match. this requires, using (4.21),

yi = aiyi

13

(4.23)

which cannot be satised for yi > 1. this tells us that only non-consecutive tau functions
tending to zero at the boundary are allowed. this result is important since numerical in-
vestigation suggests that, under the non-overlapping charge sector regime, it is not possible
to nd multi-soliton solutions which are both regular in the physical region and obey this
restriction. however, a proof of this conjecture is lacking.

4.4.1 overlapping charge sectors, qmax > r+1
2

it is however sometimes possible to obtain acceptable multi-soliton solutions in cases where
the charge sectors overlap. the rst case where this is possible is r = 4. consider a solution
containing all the possible solitons of the theory. then look at the charge sectors:

charge sector soliton combinations

2

2 211 12
1 122 12
0 11 22 1122
1 122 12
2 211 12

now we must apply the usual charge sector equations (4.9). in the non-overlapping
case, the highest occupied charge sector yields an equation solely in c. here, however, we
obtain an equation in d1 and c which must be solved simultaneously with the other charge
sector equations. the three equations from (4.9) are:
1a11[(c  2m1)2  1] + d2
c 2  1 + d2
2a22[(c  2m2)2  1]
+ d2
1d2
2(a12a12)2a11a22[(c  2(m1 + m2))2  1] = 0

(4.24)

(c  m1)2  1 + d2

2a12a12a22[(c  (m1 + 2m2))2  1]

+ d2ei(221)a12[(c  (m1 + m2))2  1] = 0

and

(c  m2)2  1 + d2

1a12a12a11[(c  (m2 + 2m1))2  1]

+ d1ei(1+22)a12[(c  (m1 + m2))2  1] = 0.

(4.25)

(4.26)

if we take ei(221) and ei(1+22) to be real we can nd another real solution to
these equations. we shall call this the exceptional solution. this has energy c =

m1 + m2  5 and we can once again determine the boundary conditions which it obeys.

what is remarkable is that in this case, this exceptional solution is regular in the physical
region, has non-consecutive zeroes of the tau functions at x = 0, and ts exactly those
boundary conditions not covered by the non-exceptional solutions.

we can also use this technique for the case r = 5 where, despite greater diculties with

nding solutions to the four simultaneous equations, we obtain similar results.

4.5 vacuum solution results

r

before presenting our results for the static background solutions for the a(1)
series of ane
toda eld theories up to r = 5 below, let us quickly recap the allowed background solutions.
of the non-exceptional solutions, there are few allowed background congurations. in the
case r = even, the only allowed background solutions contain either no solitons or a
soliton/conjugate soliton pair. when r = odd we are also allowed the case of a single
middle soliton.
in any of these cases, the singularity may reside at the boundary x =
0, allowing additional choices in the boundary conditions obeyed. however, when r 
4, these congurations do not span all the possible boundary conditions. to nd the
vacuum solutions for these remaining boundary conditions, it is necessary to consider the
exceptional solutions.
in the cases considered these exceptional solutions completely
cover the boundary conditions not covered by the non-exceptional congurations.
it is
expected that similar results will extend beyond r = 5 although a proof is lacking.

it should be noted that, in many cases, more than one possible background conguration
ts with a particular boundary condition. when this occurs, the vacuum solution is of
course that background conguration which has lowest energy.

our results up to r = 5 are tabulated in table 1. these results are ordered within each

theory with decreasing c, or equivalently, increasing energy.

5 classical scattering solutions

besides classical backgrounds, more information can be obtained from the classical equa-
tions of motion. the classical limit of the reection matrix ka can be found by considering
solutions which correspond to innitesimal classical uctuations around the background
conguration [15].

suppose the eld is perturbed about the vacuum

(x, t) = vac(x) + (x, t).

(5.1)

then by considering the equations of motion we nd that, in the limit x  , (x, t)
may have the asymptotic form

(x, t)  aeiet(eipx + kaeipx),

(5.2)

consisting of two superposed incoming and outgoing states. here a is a mass-eigenstate;
an eigenvector of the mass matrix m 2 = ii  i. solutions of this form which obey
the boundary conditions can be generated by considering non-static two soliton solutions,
where now

(x, t) = (x  vt)

v = ie.

(5.4)

(5.5)

hence we must add these two solitons both of type a to the background conguration and
determine ka by insisting that the resulting tau functions satisfy

i  i + 2ci  (c 2  1)i|x=0 = 0
or of course equivalently from the charge sector point of view

ti  t i + 2ct i  (c 2  1)ti|x=0 = 0.

(5.6)

(5.7)

it is then very simple to determine the values of k corresponding to dierent boundary
conditions.

although they have already been set out in [16], let us briey restate the results for
the classical reection factors in the cases which have non-exceptional vacuum solutions.
in fact, we shall see that this is not necessarily relevant to cases which are singular at the
boundary x = 0. solving the equation for the highest occupied charge sector reveals that

ka =

2ip + m2
a
2ip  m2

a

n

yj=1

aabj (p)
aabj (p)

(5.8)

where a is the particle being scattered and bj are the solitons present in the background. n
refers to the number of soliton species (not including conjugates) present in the background.
the only exception to this is the at background case + + ...+, where

ka =

2ip  m2
a
2ip + m2
a

.

(5.9)

it has been checked in [16] that these reection factors obey the classical reection boot-
strap equation.

there is however a little more subtlety involved when we consider the cases where one
or more of the background tau functions vanish at x = 0. in this case it is not so clear
that a linear perturbation in    +  and in the tau functions i  i + i are equivalent.
however, with certain restrictions on the i (namely that if i  0 as x  0 then i  0
as quickly or faster in order to result in a nite perturbation ) we can achieve the same
results. since the boundary conditions tell us that from the tau function point of view

c 

i
i

= ais i1i+1

 2
i

17

(5.10)

then if we take i so that i+1 goes to zero whilst i1 and i do not, then clearly we
require the term linear in  in i+1 to go to zero at x = 0.
in fact, this is almost the
same restriction as the requirement that the perturbation  is nite. this condition gives
us another equation which must be satised by the reection factor k. it is simplest to
consider the case where we take the parameters ei to be real, so that the vacuum solution
tau functions are symmetric about 0 (i.e. ri+1 = i)  the other boundary conditions
are of course related by the cyclical symmetry. let us illustrate our point by considering the
case of a(1)
for the boundary conditions + or + + which contains two static solitons
2
in the background solution. here, let us take  =  so that, as far as the background
solution is concerned, 0  0 as x  0 and 1 = 2. now adding in the perturbation, we
require the right-hand sides of the two boundary conditions

and

(5.11)

(5.12)

(evaluated at x = 0) to be equal up to o(), with a possible sign dierence between a1
and a2. hence we expect

a1

1
1

= a2

2
2

(5.13)

up to o(). in actual fact, for a1 = a2, this equation is satised identically for all k
and hence the same scattering data as we found before for the non-singular background
also obeys this boundary condition. however, for a1 = a2 we require both sides of the
equation to vanish. imposing this condition leads to a somewhat unaesthetic non-diagonal
scattering solution also found by corrigan [23]. diagonal scattering is expected in a(1)
as the conservation of spin even charges (which distinguish between particles and their
conjugates) implies that a particle should be reected back into itself [15], and is moreover
implied by the bootstrap equations. to see this, consider the bootstrap equation depicted
in figure 1 for the non-diagonal case. consider the case where c = 1. then non-diagonal
scattering implies that c can be reected as a particle of type 1 or 2. this particle will
then decompose into two particles a and b, either of type 1 or 2, but in any case a = b.
however, the rhs implies that c will split rst into two particles of type 2, which are then
each reected as types 1 or 2. in this case there is no requirement that a = b. hence the
scattering must be either diagonal (as generally believed for real coupling toda theory) or
completely o-diagonal (a possibility suggested by the recent paper by delius [24]). this
is rules out the unaesthetic non-diagonal scattering solution for the case a1 = a2.

condition +  .

it is not dicult to extend the above argument to include all vacuum solutions in a(1)
ane toda theory consisting of two static solitons. when the singularity is placed at the
boundary it can be shown that, for any i  s, we obtain an analogous equation to (5.13),
involving the boundary parameters ai1 and ai+1. this relation is only solved for diagonal
scattering if we takes these two parameters to be opposite. this rules out a large subset of
the integrable boundary conditions. whilst it would appear that there is no problem with
singular background solutions containing only one static middle soliton (here, the signs of
the (say) odd i boundary parameters remain arbitrary since the o() term of  
i
i
we also nd that the exceptional solutions of a(1)
5 have problems. for example,
using the exceptional solution of a(1)
4 , we nd that there are two vanishing tau functions,
1 and 4 (preserving the symmetry around 0). then, as noted earlier, we require the
linear perturbations of both of these vanishing tau functions to vanish at x = 0. but
each of these requires a dierent k. a similar conclusion is reached when considering the
a(1)
exceptional solution. so in these cases, it seems that no diagonal scattering solutions
5
are possible which go as a as x  . it would therefore appear that a large subset
of the integrable boundary conditions do not admit suitable classical scattering solutions.
the ones that do fall into one of three categories: they are consistent with a background
conguration which either contains no solitons, a single middle soliton (in the case r = odd)

4 and a(1)

19

or a soliton/conjugate soliton pair where the signs of the boundary parameters on each
side of a vanishing tau function are opposite.

5.1 classical scattering results

we use the usual notation for expression of the reection factors. we dene

(x) =

sinh( 
sinh( 

2 + ix
2  ix

2(r+1) )
2(r+1) )

.

(5.14)

the results for the reection factors for r up to 5 are given in table 2.

6 conclusions

in this paper we have presented a number of results about classical solutions to ane toda
eld theory on a half-line. extending what had previously been achieved for the special
case of sinh-gordon [15], we used a bogomolny argument to ascertain which boundary
conditions lead to stable theories with bounded energy on the half-line. this class includes
all integrable boundary conditions for simply-laced ane toda theories, although many lie
on the boundary of stability.

however, it turns out that there are still diculties with providing a classical picture
of scattering in some cases. this was found by considering the vacuum and scattering
solutions for low rank a(1)
r ane toda eld theories in great detail in order to attempt to
shed some light on what happens in general. we have found many unusual characteristics
of these theories. it was found that although acceptable vacuum solutions can be found
for all the integrable boundary conditions, not all of these appear to admit classical
scattering data consistent with the reection bootstrap equation. another problem is that
many of the classical background solutions contain parameters or moduli describing equally
valid degenerate ground states. exact solutions which correspond to excitations of these
zero-modes can be found, but they are problematic in that they become singular in some
nite time. if analytically continued beyond this time the solutions then satisfy changed
boundary conditions.

finally, it would be interesting to compare these results with those of [25, 26] where

quantum reection factors for a(1)

r atft were considered.
