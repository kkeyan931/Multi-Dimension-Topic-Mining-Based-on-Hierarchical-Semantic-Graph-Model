abstract

we compute the spin of both the topological and nontopological solitons of the

chern - simons - higgs model by using our approach based on constrained analysis.

we also propose an extension of our method to the non - relativistic chern - simons

models. the spin formula for both the relativistic and nonrelativistic theories turn

out to be structurally identical. this form invariance manifests the topological

origin of the chern - simons term responsible for inducing fractional spin. also,

some comparisons with the existing results are done.

in (2+1) dimensional eld theories the gauge - eld dynamics may be dictated by the

chern - simons (c-s) piece instead of the maxwell ( yang - mills) term. interest in the

c-s eld theories originated from the observation that the c-s term implements the hopf

interaction in (2+1) dimensional o(3) nonlinear sigma model within the framework of

local gauge theory [1]. the soliton sector of the theory oers excitations (baby skyrmions)

carrying fractional spin and statistics [2, 3]. pure c-s coupled eld theories can support

self dual vortex congurations - a fact exemplied by numerous models [4]. a remarkable

aspect of the c-s gauge eld is that it can be coupled with both poincare and galileo

symmetric models [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. the latter possibility is very useful in view of the

applications of the c-s theories in condensed matter physics [10]. there are dierent

computations of the spin of the c - s vortices, both relativistic [3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

and non-relativistic [17, 18]. however, the results do not always agree [19]. recently, we

have proposed a general framework for obtaining the spin of relativistic c - s vortices

[14] which is found to give consistent results for a variety of c - s theories [15]. in this

paper an extension of our method [14, 15] applicable to the nonrelativistic c - s models

is presented. consequently, a general method, equally viable in the relativistic and non-

relativistic cases, is provided. to put our work in the proper perspective let us rst give

a brief digression.

the usual method of dening the spin of the c-s vortices is to identify the spin with

the total angular momentum in the static soliton conguration [4, 11, 12, 13]. this

angular momentum integral is constructed from the symmetric energy - momentum (e

- m) tensor obtained by varying the action with respect to a background metric. since

this e - m tensor is relevant in formulating the dirac - schwinger conditions [20] it will

henceforth be referred as the schwinger e - m tensor. correspondingly, the angular

momentum following from this energy momentum tensor usually goes by the name of

schwinger. it is both symmetric and gauge invariant, and also occurs naturally in the

context of the general theory of relativity. for these properties it is also interpreted as

the physical angular momentum. contrary to the noether angular momentum, however,

the schwinger angular momentum does not have a natural splitting into an orbital and a

spin part [21]. thus it is not transparent how the value of this angular momentum in the

static limit may be identied with the intrinsic spin of the vortices.

in the alternative eld - theoretic denition of the spin of the c-s vortices advanced in

[14] ,one abstracts the canonical part from the physical angular momentum. the canonical

part is obtained by using the conventional noether denition. both the canonical as

well as the physical angular momentum are obtained from the improved versions of the

corresponding e - m tensors to properly account for the constraints of the theory. now

the noether angular momentum contains the orbital part plus the contribution coming

from the spin degrees of freedom as appropriate for generating local transformations of

the elds under lorentz transformations [23].

its dierence from the physical angular

momentum is shown to be a total boundary containing the c-s gauge eld only, the value

of which depends on the asymptotic limit of the c-s eld. it vanishes for nonsingular

congurations. however, for the c-s vortex congurations we get a nonzero contribution.

this contribution is found to be independent of the origin of the coordinate system. it

is possible to interpret this dierence as an internal angular momentum characterising

the intrinsic spin of the c-s vortices. the connection of the anomalous spin with the

topological c-s interaction is thus clearly revealed.

the c-s coupled o(3) nonlinear sigma model provides an ideal example for the com-

parision of the dierent methods. the schwingers e - m tensor for the model is given by

the well known expression [1],

s
 =

2
f 2 (2na na  g nana),

where na(a = 1, 2, 3) are the sigma model elds satisfying

the angular momentum integral is,

nana = 1

j = z d2xijxis

0j

(1)

(2)

(3)

since the (0,j) component of s

 explicitly involves a time derivative of na, j vanishes
in the static conguration. the denition of [11, 12, 13] then predicts zero spin of the

baby skyrmions. however, it is denitely proved from quite general arguments that these

excitations carry fractional spin and statistics [2, 3]. in fact it has been shown that the

spin value is given by,

s =


2

(4)

where  is the c-s coupling strength. the connection of the baby skyrmions with the

quasiparticles found in the quantum hall state has been established, where the anomalous

spin of the excitations play a crucial role [24]. so the vanishing spin of the baby skyrmions

predicted by the denition of [11, 12, 13] is clearly a contradiction. this contradiction,

which was earlier noticed in [16], prompted alternative denitions [14, 16] for obtaining

the spin of the vortices. in this context it is interesting to note that the denition of [14]

gives an entirely satisfactory result for this model.

in [14] we work in a gauge - independent formalism [25] and the schwinger e - m

tensor is required to be augmented by appropriate linear combinations of the constraints

of the theory [26], so as to generate proper transformation of the elds [27]. the dierence

of the angular momenta obtained from the schwinger and the canonical e - m tensors is

k =  z d2xi(xiajaj  xjaiaj),

(5)

where ai is the c-s gauge eld. the asymptotic form of the gauge eld is only required

to compute k and this form is dictated by the requirements of rotational symmetry and

the gauss constraint of the theory to be,

ai(x) =

q
2

ij

xj
|x|2 ,

where q is the topological charge. using (5) we get

k =

q2
2

.

(6)

(7)

for the baby skyrmions q = 1 and the spin value agrees with equation (4). this example

shows that the denition of [14] yields results compatible with general arguments [2].

we now extend our formalism for calculating the spin of the vortices in nonrelativistic

models with c-s coupling, which is the main thrust of the paper. the galileo invariant

models cannot be made generally covariant and so a gauge invariant e - m tensor cannot be

constructed along the lines of schwinger. nevertheless we can build up a gauge invariant

e - m tensor using the equations of motion [5]. we are then able to apply our formalism

developed for the relativistic theories by substituting the schwinger e - m tensor with

this one. the resulting spin formula comes out to be exactly equivalent to that obtained

in the relativistic case, revealing the topological connection of the origin of the fractional

spin. before discussing the nonrelativistic case, a quick survey of a relativistic example is

appropriate.

the lagrangian of the c-s-h model is

l = (d)(d) +

k
2

a a  v (||)

where the covariant derivative is dened by,

d =  + iea

(8)

(9)

this model is known to possess both topological as well as nontopological vortices. ac-

cording to our denition [14] the spin of the vortices is dened as

k = j s  j n

(10)

where j s and j n are, respectively, the schwinger and noether angular momentum. we

work in a gauge independent formalism where the constraints of the theory are weakly

zero. dierent e-m tensors are thus required to be augmented by appropriate linear

combination of the constraints of the theory to obtain proper transformation of the elds.

from a detailed analysis of the model (8) we arrive at the following augmented ex-

pressions for j s and j n [15],

j s = z d2xij xi[j +  j  klmajlam]
j n = z d2x[ij xi(j +  j 

lmaljam) +

k
2

k

ajaj]

(11)

(12)

where ( ) is the momentum conjugate to (). using (11) and (12) in (10) we get

k = 

k

2 z d2~xi[xiajaj  aixjaj]

(13)

which is the same formula as obtained for the o(3) nonlinear sigma model ( see equation

(5) ). note that the integrand is a boundary term so that only the asymptotic form of

the gauge eld ai is required for the computation of k.

for topological vortices, the matter eld  at innity bears a representation of the

broken u(1) symmetry,

  vein

(14)

where n is the topological charge. the requirement of nite energy of the conguration

dictates that asymptotically,

eai = nij

xj
|x|2

(15)

the above form is rotationally symmetric and satises the gauss law. as a consequence

the magnetic ux  is quantised

 =

2n

e

after a straightforward calculation using (13) and (15), we obtain,

k =

kn2

e2

(16)

(17)

the nontopological vortices lie at the threshold of stability [13]. for these the magnetic

ux  is arbitrary. the asymptotic form of the gauge eld is now expressed as

ai =


2

ij

xj
|x|2

(18)

and the spin computed from (13) is

k =

k2
4

(19)

equations (17) and (19) give the spin of the topological and nontopological vortices of

the c-s-h model respectively. notice that the sign of the spin is +ve in both the cases,

which again is the same as that of the elementary excitations of the model. in earlier

analysis [13] there was a dierence in sign which was explained by the introduction of a

new interaction. this is not necessary in the present discussion.

now we will apply the same general method to nonrelativistic models. consider the

lagrangian

l = idt 

1
2m

(dk)(dk) +

k
2

aa

(20)

where  is a bosonic schrodinger eld. the model (20) is invariant under the galilean

transformations and not under the transformations of the poincare group. note that

the galilean transformations take time and space on an unequal footing. so space-time

metric is not dened. in writing (20) we adopt a spatial eucledian metric, covariant and

contravariant components are thus not to be distinguished.

the action of the model (20) cannot be made generally covariant. the powerful

method of constructing a gauge invariant energy - momentum (e - m) tensor, as formu-

lated by schwinger, is thus not available. nonetheless, it is possible to construct a gauge

invariant e - m tensor by appealing to the equations of motion [5]. our program is then

clear. we will nd a gauge-invariant momentum density from the matter current obtained

by using the equations of motion. these equations will then be exploited to show the

conservation of the corresponding momentum. we work in the gauge independent for-

malism in contrast with the gauge-xed approach of [5]. a suitable linear combination

of the gauss constraint is to be added with the gauge invariant momentum operator, in

order to generate the correct transformation of the elds under spatial translation. a

gauge invariant angular momentum is then constructed using this momentum density.

the canonical angular momentum obtained by noethers prescription is now subtracted

from it. the spin of the vortices is, as usual, dened by

k = j  j n

(21)

which is exactly similar to equation (10) with the exception that j is now the gauge

invariant angular momentum constructed by using the equations of motion.

from the lagrangian (20) we write the euler-lagrange equation corresponding to a,

k a = j

(22)

where j is given by

j0 = 
1

ji =

2im

[(di)  (di)]

observe that (22) leads to a continuity equation

0j0 + iji = 0

(23)

(24)

(25)

so that j0 and ji can be interpreted as the matter density and current density respectively.

from the e-l equation corresponding to a0 we get the gauss constraint of the theory

g =   kijiaj  0

(26)

now we come to the construction of the gauge invariant momentum operator. the

(0-i)th component of the em tensor t0i(i.e. the momentum density) is obtained from the

matter current

t0i =

i
2

[(di)  (di)]

(27)

we verify by a straightforward calculation using the equations of motion that t0i indeed

satises the appropriate continuity equation,

0t0i + ktki = 0

(28)

where tki is the stress - tensor,

tki =

1
2m

[(dk)(di) + (dk)(di)  i(dk + (dk))]

(29)

using the expression(27) of t0i we construct a gauge invariant momentum operator

pi = z d2xt0i

(30)

exploiting (28) and neglecting the boundary term we nd that pi is indeed conserved,

dpi
dt

= 0

(31)

the boundary term vanishes due to the condition that the covariant derivative di is

zero on the boundary which is required to keep the energy nite.

the lagrangian (20) is rst order in time derivatives. it is then easy to read o the

basic brackets from (20) by symplectic arguments. the nontrivial brackets are

{(x), (y)} = i(x  y)

{ai(x), aj(y)} =

1
k

ij(x  y)

(32)

using these basic brackets we obtain,

{(x), pi} = i(x) + iai(x)

(33)

hence the transformation of  deviates from the expected canonical structure. for proper

transformation of the elds under spatial translation we require to supplement t0i by the

gauss constraint,

t t

0i = t0i + aig

and the corresponding momentum operator

pi = z d2x[

i
2

(di  (di)) + aig]

(34)

(35)

turns out to be an appropriate generator of spatial translation. the term containing the

gauss operator in (35) exactly generates a piece in {(x), pi} which cancels the anomalous

term in (33).

we now come to the construction of j, the gauge invariant angular momentum, from

the momentum density (35),

j = z d2xijxi[

i
2

(dj  (dj)) + ajg]

the canonical angular momentum j n is obtained from noethers theorem as [7],

j n = z d2x[ijxi(

i
2

(j  (j)) 

k
2

mnamjan) +

k
2

ajaj]

substituting (36) and (37) in (21) we obtain,

k = 

k

2 z d2xi[xia2  xjajai]

(36)

(37)

(38)

observe that the master formula for the calculation of spin (38) is identical with equation

(13). the asymptotic form of ai following from general considerations already elaborated

leads to the same structure as in (15). inserting this in (38) exactly reproduces (17) as

the spin of the vortices.

we note in passing that self - dual soliton solutions can be obtained by including a

quartic self - interaction in (20) [5], which are interpreted as the nonrelativistic limit of

the nontopological vortices of the relativistic chern - simons - higgs model considered

previously. the spin of these solitons can be calculated by (38) using the asymptotic

form (18). the result comes out to be identical with (19). this is expected, because

the existence of the fractional spin is connected to the chern - simons piece which is a

topological term. the spin of the vortices of the model (20) with quartic self - interaction

and an external magnetic eld was calculated earlier [17, 18]. their method was in spirit

akin to that of [11, 12, 13] but they had to subtract the background contribution to get

the exact spin. the result of [17, 18] scales with the topological number as in our case, but

with opposite signature. the same comments apply to this comparison as made earlier

in connection with the c - s - h model.

to conclude, we found that the usual method of dening the spin as the static limit of

the physical angular momentum yields contradictory results when applied to compute the

spin of the solitons of the chern - simons (c-s) coupled o(3) nonlinear sigma model[16].

in this connection we have observed that a consistent result is obtained when we apply

our general formalism for computing the spin in the c-s theories [14], which exploits the

constraints of the theory. here the canonical part of the physical angular momentum is

abstracted by subtracting the canonical (noether) angular momentum from the angular

momentum obtained from schwingers e - m tensor [20]. the dierence was found to

be nonzero for singular congurations. in particular for c-s vortices this dierence was

shown to be independent of the origin of the coordinate system. consequently we interpret

it as the intrinsic spin of the vortices. the formula for the spin comes out to be model

independent and contrary to other approaches where detailed eld congurations are

necessary, only the asymptotic form of the gauge eld is required for its evaluation.

the spin of the topological and nontopological vortices of the c-s-h model was re-

viewed by the general formalism mentioned above. the spin of both types of vortices of

the model comes out with the same sign. we also nd that the sign of the spin of the

topological vortices is the same as that of the elementary excitations of the model [29].

this is a satisfactory result because the spin-statistics connection is then respected with

the usual aharonov - bohm phase. notably, in [13] an opposite sign was found so that a

new interaction was required to properly account for this phase [30].

our formalism is directly applicable to the relativistic theories but the chern - simons

interaction enjoys the rare distinction of being suitable to be coupled to both poincare

and galileo symmetric models [5 -9]. we were thus motivated to extend our formalism

to the nonrelativistic theories. moreover, a systematic discussion of the spin in such

theories is nonexistent. although an explicit calculation exists [17, 18], the connection

of the method with the corresponding ones used for the relativistic models is not quite

clear. our extended formalism treated the nonrelativistic models within the same general

framework used for the relativistic case. the resulting spin formula was identical with

that obtained for the relativistic theories. this points to the topological origin of the

c-s term, responsible for the induction of the fractional spin, either in relativistic or

nonrelativistic models.
