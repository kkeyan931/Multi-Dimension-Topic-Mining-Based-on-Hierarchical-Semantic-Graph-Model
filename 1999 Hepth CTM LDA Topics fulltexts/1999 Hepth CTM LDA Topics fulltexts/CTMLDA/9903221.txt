(36) take derivatives respect : w = q1(0; , 0)p 1(, 0; )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0) + +q1(0; , 0) p 1(, 0; )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0) + +q1(0; , 0)p 1(, 0; ) q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0). (52) here, made use fact p (, 0; 0) independent . preparation use theorem 3, start eq. (13) w use theorem 1 l w = w w 1 = 1(; )  (; ). (53) use theorem 6 evaluate derivative product integral respect parameter : p (, 0; ) = z 0 dp (, ; ) a1(; )p (, 0; ). (54) 13 then, simple manipulations using dening equations various terms eq. (53), get: 1(; ) p ( )p 1( )t (; ) = z 0 dt 1(; ) a1(; )t (; ). (55) using theorem 2 fact p (0, 0; ) = 1, write rest eq.

(57) using theorem 3, immediately led eq. (50) obtained previous method proof. two reasons relative simplicity proof one given previous section. one due use dierentiation respect parameter according theorem 6. due use eq.
