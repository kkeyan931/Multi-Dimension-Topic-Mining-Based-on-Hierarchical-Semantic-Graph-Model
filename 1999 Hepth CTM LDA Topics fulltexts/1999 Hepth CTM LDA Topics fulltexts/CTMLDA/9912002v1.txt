1. introduction

bps black holes in four and ve dimensional n = 2 supergravity have been much

studied using the attractor mechanism. to construct a black hole solution, one species

the charges and asymptotic values of the moduli. the moduli then evolve as a function of

the radius until they reach a minimum of the central charge at the horizon. this minimum

value determines the entropy of the black hole. consequently, it is important to know if

dierent values of the central charge can be attained at dierent local minima, or perhaps

even more basically if multiple local minima are allowed. if uniqueness fails, one would be

led to believe that the degeneracy of bps states does not solely depend on the charges.

as it turns out, in the ve dimensional case we can show that at most one critical

point of the central charge can occur; that is the subject of this paper. the structure of

the argument is simple. remarkably, the extended kahler cone turns out to be convex.

therefore we can take a straight line between two supposed minima and analyse the

(correctly normalised) central charge along this line. the central charge cannot have

two minima when restricted to this line, yielding a contradiction.

we would like to emphasize that although calabi-yau spaces will be in the back of

our minds for most of this paper, the geometric statements have clear analogues in ve

dimensional supergravity, so that our arguments are independent of the presence of a

calabi-yau. we will point out some of the parallel interpretations where they occur.

in section two we provide two arguments for uniqueness in a single kahler cone. in

section three we tackle the extended kahler cone, and in section four we discuss some of

the implications. the reader may wish to start with section four before moving on to the

arguments of sections two and three.

2. single kahler cone

2.1. review of the attractor mechanism

let us recall the basic setting for the ve-dimensional attractor problem. we consider

m-theory compactied on a calabi-yau threefold. as the low-energy eective theory we
obtain ve dimensional n = 2 supergravity with h1,1  1 vector multiplets, h2,1 + 1

hypermultiplets and the gravity multiplet [1]. the vector multiplets each contain one real
scalar, so the vector moduli space is h1,1  1 dimensional. from the point of view of

calabi-yau compactication these scalars have a simple geometrical interpretation. let us

1

denote the calabi-yau three-fold by x and expand two-cycles q of x as q = qi ei, where
ei is a basis for h2(x, z). the dual basis for h 2(x, z) will be written with lower indices,
j. the calabi-yau kahler class k can be expanded as k = ki ei
which gives an h1,1 dimensional space of parameters. one parameter corresponding to the

ej, so that (cid:10)ej ei(cid:11) = i

total volume of the calabi-yau is part of the universal hypermultiplet and the rest of the

parameters corresponding to the sizes of cycles in the calabi-yau describe precisely the

moduli space of vector multiplets.

the dynamics of vector multiplets in n = 2 supergravity is completely governed by the

prepotential f (k), which is a homogeneous cubic polynomial in vector moduli coordinates
ki. it is a special property of ve dimensional supergravity that there are no nonperturba-

tive quantum corrections to this prepotential [2]. geometrically the prepotential is simply

the volume of x in terms of k

f (k)

(2.1)

where dijl denote the triple intersection numbers of x

dijl = zx

ei  ej  el.

in order to abbreviate the formulae, let us introduce the following notation:

a  b  ambm

a  b  c  aibjcldijl

k3  k  k  k

to decouple the universal hypermultiplet coordinate we need to impose the constraint

f (k) = 1 which gives us the vector moduli space as a hypersurface inside the kahler cone.

alternatively, we will sometimes think of the moduli space as a real projectivisation of the

kahler cone. in this case we have to consider functions invariant under overall rescaling

of ks.

the prepotential denes the metric on moduli space as well as the gauge coupling

matrix for the ve-dimensional gauge elds. including the graviphoton, there are exactly
h1,1 u (1) gauge elds in the theory and their moduli-dependent gauge coupling matrix is

given by [3]

gij = 

1
2

2

ki kj log f (k) = 

1
2

2

ki kj log k3

(2.2)

2

the moduli space metric gij is just the restriction of gij to the hypersurface f (k) = 1. in
the supergravity lagrangian gij and gij multiply kinetic terms for the gauge elds and the
moduli elds respectively. it is then very important that both metrics should be positive-

denite inside the physical moduli space. the tangent space to the f (k) = 1 hypersurface

is given by vectors k such that k  k  k = 0. then positivity of gij requires

ki gij kj  ki gij kj = 3 k  k  k > 0.

(2.3)

next we consider bps states with given electric charges. the vector of electric charges
with respect to the h1,1 u (1) gauge elds can be thought of as an element q of h2(x, z).
in m-theory language these bps states are m2-branes wrapped on a holomorphic cycle in

the class q. for large charges we can represent them in supergravity by certain extremal

black hole solutions [6]. the structure of these solutions is as follows. as one moves radially
towards the black hole the vector multiplet moduli elds ki vary. they follow the gradient

ow of the function z  q  k:

 u = +

 ki =

here u  u (r) is the function determining the ve dimensional metric

ds2 = e4u dt2 + e2u (dr2 + r2d2),

 = 1/r2 and the covariant derivative is

dj = j

kikldijl.

geometrically z is just the volume of the holomorphic cycle q in the calabi-yau with

kahler class k. we will refer to z(k) as the central charge because when evaluated at

innity, z is indeed the electric central charge of the n = 2 algebra. as we approach the

horizon of the black hole at r = 0 or  = , the central charge rolls into a local minimum

and the moduli stabilise there, let us call that point k0. the area of the horizon and thus
the entropy of the black hole are determined only by the minimal value of the central

charge [4,5] :

s =

(q  k0)3/2.

(2.4)

those points in the moduli space where the central charge attains a local minimum for a

xed electric charge q are called attractor points.

the microscopic count of the number of bps states with given charge has been per-

formed for the special case of compactications of m-theory on elliptic calabi-yau three-

folds [7]. there the attractor point for any charge vector q was found explicitly and the

resulting entropy prediction (2.4) agreed with the microscopic count for large charges.

it was pointed out in [8] that in the case of general calabi-yau compactications an

attractor point is not necessarily unique, and in principle for making an entropy prediction

one needs to specify not only the charges of the black hole, but also an attractor basin,

that is one needs to specify a region in moduli space in which all the points ow to a

given attractor point along a path from innity to the horizon. in the remainder of this

article we show that if a minimum of the central charge exists, the attractor basin for this

minimum covers the entire moduli space. there cannot be a second local minimum and so

the specication of the charges of the black hole is sucient for determining the attractor

point.

2.2. geometric argument

to nd an attractor point explicitly, one needs to extremise the central charge sub-

ject to the constraint k  k  k = 1, which leads directly to the ve dimensional attractor

equation [5]

qi = (q  k) kj kl dijl

in dierential form notation, it reads

[q] = (cid:18)zq

k(cid:19) [k  k].

(2.5)

here [q] is a four-form which is poincare dual to the two-cycle q. for convenience, we

will leave out the square brackets in what follows.

let us recall some standard facts about the lefschetz decomposition (see for in-

stance [9]). on any kahler manifold the kahler class is a harmonic form of type (1,1).

it can therefore be used to dene an action on the cohomology. we dene the raising
operator to be the map from h p,q(x, c) to h p+1,q+1(x, c) obtained by wedging with k

lk = k  

4

and similarly the lowering operator to be the map from h p,q(x, c) to h p1,q1(x, c)

obtained by contracting with k

k = k.

the commutator sends forms of type (p,q) to themselves up to an overall factor:

[l, ] = (p + q  n)i

(2.6)

where n is the complex dimension of x. thus l,  and (p+qn)i form an sl(2, r) algebra

and the cohomology of x decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. when

x is a calabi-yau threefold, the decomposition is

h (x, c) = 1(3/2)  (h1,1  1)(1/2)  (2h2,1 + 2)(0).

the spin 3/2 represenatation corresponds to {1, k, k2, k3}. there can be no spin 0 repre-
sentations in h 1,1(x, c) because if  is of type (1,1) and lk = 0 then by equation (2.6)
we deduce that  is zero. in particular, the raising operator lk maps classes of type (1,1)
isomorphically onto classes of type (2,2). we will use this fact in the following argument.1

to prove that a single kahler cone supports at most one attractor point, assume to

the contrary that there are two such points, k0 and k1, satisfying (2.5). then we may
rescale k0 or k1 by a positive factor such that

k0  k0 = k1  k1.

(2.7)

first we x the sign in the above equation. since 1

2 (k0 + k1) is inside the kahler cone,
k0 + k1 is an admissible kahler class and rx (k0 + k1)3 is positive. assuming the sign in

(2.7) is minus, one may expand (k0 + k1)3 and deduce that

z (k0 + k1)3 = 2z (k0)3  2z (k1)3 < 0 ,

which is impossible, so the sign is a plus. therefore we have

(k0 + k1)  (k0  k1) = 0.

as discussed above, lk0+k1 cannot annihilate any classes of type (1,1) because k0 + k1 is
an allowed kahler class. we conclude that k0  k1 must vanish.

1 we thank c. vafa for this argument.

5

2.3. physical argument

one doesnt really need the attractor equation to prove that in a single cone multiple

critical points cannot occur. another argument makes use of the simple properties of

the prepotential (2.1) and gives further insight into the behaviour of the central charge

function.

let us examine the behaviour of the central charge along straight lines in the kahler

cone. first take any two points k0 and k1 in the kahler cone. by convexity of the cone
we can take a straight line from k0 to k1,

k(t) = k0 + t k, k = k1  k0.

(2.8)

for t between 0 and 1 and a little bit beyond those values k(t) certainly lies in the kahler
cone, but it no longer satises k(t)3 = 1. to cure this we think of the moduli space as

a real projectivisation of the kahler cone and dene the central charge everywhere in the

cone by normalising k:

z(k) =

q  k
(k3)1/3

then the central charge along the straight line (2.8) is just

rq k

(rx k  k  k)1/3 =

z(t) =

q  k(t)
(k(t)3)1/3 .

(2.9)

(2.10)

let us also assume that the central charge is positive at k0, i.e. z(0) > 0. otherwise we
would consider the same problem with the opposite charge.

dierentiating z(t), one nds for the rst derivative

z (t) = (k3)4/3(cid:0)(q  k)(k3)  (q  k)(k  k  k)(cid:1) .

(2.11)

now suppose z(t) has a critical point tc where z (tc) = 0. then the second derivative at
tc can be expressed as

z (tc) = 2(k3)4/3(q  k)(cid:18) (k  k  k)2
= 2(k3)4/3(q  k)(bij kikj).

k3

 k  k  k(cid:19)

the bilinear form bij has the following properties: exactly one of its eigenvalues is zero
in the language of
(namely in the k-direction) and the other eigenvalues are positive.

6

calabi-yau geometry this holds2 because rx k  k  k < 0 for any k that satises
rx k  k  k = 0. now if k would be proportional to k(t) = k0 + tk for some t, we

would nd that k0 and k1 are in fact equal. thus k necessarily has a piece that is
orthogonal to k(t) and so

bij kikj > 0 strictly.

in the language of supergravity the above statement follows from the fact that the form

b is proportional to the metric when restricted to directions tangent to the moduli space,

for which k  k  k = 0, see (2.3). the zero eigenvalue in the k-direction is simply the scale

invariance of z(k).

the above inequality can be expressed in the following words:

for positive central

charge any critical point along any straight line is in fact a local minimum! for negative

z every critical point along a straight line is a local maximum.

it is well known that

a critical point of the central charge is a minimum when considered as a function of all

moduli. here we have a much stronger statement. we see that on a one-dimensional

subspace (a projection of a straight line) any critical point is in fact a local minimum.

we can use the above observation as follows. the central charge z has a local mini-

mum at the attractor point k0 by denition. therefore it must grow continuously on any
straight line emanating from k0 and can never achieve a second local minimum. moreover,
we see that the central charge has a global minimum at k0 in the entire kahler cone.

let us remark on another consequence of our observation. consider level sets of the

central charge function, i.e sets where z < a for some constant a. note that all such sets

are necessarily convex. for otherwise, if we could connect two points inside a level set by

a line segment venturing outside it, there would be a maximum of the central charge on

that line segment, which contradicts the above observation.

3. extended kahler cone

3.1. review

the single kahler cone we have just discussed is only a part of the full vector moduli
space.3 some of the boundaries of the kahler cone correspond to actual boundaries of the

moduli space. at other boundaries the calabi-yau undergoes a op transition, that is a

2 see for instance [9], page 123. note the misprint there; it should say 2k = p + q.
3 see [10] for discussion.

7

curve collapses to zero size, but one may continue through the wall and arrive in a dierent

geometric phase. there one has another calabi-yau which is birationally equivalent to the

original one. they share the same hodge numbers but have dierent triple intersection

numbers.

in terms of the original kahler moduli, the collapsed curve has a nite but

negative area on the other side of the wall. in ve dimensions this has the interpretation

of a phase transition where a bps hypermultiplet goes from positive to negative mass.

the union of the kahler cones of all calabi-yaus related to each other through a sequence

of op transitions is called the extended kahler cone. geometrically one cannot go beyond

the boundaries of this extended cone. it has also been argued that at the boundaries that

are at nite distance the physical vector moduli space ends [10].

after we cross the wall into an adjacent cone we may take linear combinations of

kahler parameters ki in order to get an acceptable set of moduli that yield positive areas

for two- and four-cycles. but we will nd it more convenient to stick to the original ki, even

though they can sometimes yield negative areas outside the original cone. by induction,

we may still use the ki if we pass through a second op transition into a third cone, and

so on.

the calabi-yau in the adjacent cone has dierent intersection numbers, which means

that we have to adjust the prepotential for the new cone.

it is well known how the

prepotential changes when one passes through a wall: if we denote by m the area of the

collapsing curve that is negative on the other side of the wall, then [11]

k  k  k  k  k  k  (#p1) m3.

(3.1)

here #p1 stands for the number of p1s shrinking to zero size at the wall. intuitively,

the growing curve should contribute a positive number to the volume of the calabi-yau

for m < 0, hence the minus sign in (3.1). this sign is crucial for proving uniqueness of

attractor points in the extended kahler cone.

physical quantities experience only a mild change at the op transition [5]. in parti-

cular from (3.1) we see that the prepotential is twice continuously dierentiable. the

central charge z is also twice continuously dierentiable. the metric, which involves

second derivatives of the prepotential, is only continuous.

8

3.2. convexity of the extended cone

the extended kahler cone has an alternative description in terms another cone, as we

will explain below. the advantage of this description comes from the fact that this other
cone is manifestly convex, hence so is the extended kahler cone4. we will only give a brief

sketch of the argument here and simply use the result in the remainder of the paper. for

a detailed proof, one may consult the mathematics literature [12] (see also [11]).

there is a one to one correspondence between real cohomology classes of type (1,1)

and line bundles. namely, given such a class [], one may nd a line bundle l[] such that
its rst chern class is [], and conversely. in order to apply some standard constructions

in algebraic geometry, we will assume that [] is a rational class, that is it is a class in the
intersection of h 1,1(x, c) and h 2(x, q).

with appropriate restrictions, some high tensor power of l[] will have suciently
many holomorphic sections to dene a good map to some projective space, as follows:

choose a basis of holomorphic sections s0, s1, . . . , sn. then we get a map f[] from x to
pn by sending a point p in x to the equivalence class [s0(p), s1(p), . . . , sn(p)]. let us call
the image y . some points p may be a common zero for all the sis. the collection of such
points is called the base locus of l[]. under f[] the base locus is mapped to the origin
in cn+1, so when one projectivises cn+1 cycles in the base locus may get contracted and

points may get smeared out. away from the base locus the map f[] is an isomorphism.

in order to insure that the image will be a calabi-yau that is related to x by op

transitions at most, we require that [] is movable, which means that the base locus is

of complex codimension at least two in x. this condition means that the map f[] is an
isomorphism in codimension one, i.e. the most that can happen is that some two-cycles

contract or some points expand to two-cycles. in particular, the canonical class of y must

be trivial, so y is a calabi-yau. finally, by construction the holomorphic sections of (some

multiple of) l[] get transformed into hyperplane sections, which are the sections of the
line bundle corresponding to the kahler class on y . so the pull-back of the kahler class

on y is precisely (some multiple of) []. it is well known that when [] is taken to be in

the original kahler cone of x, f[] will give a smooth embedding of x in projective space.
hopefully we have made it plausible that for any rational class [] of type (1,1) on x,

provided it is movable, we can nd a calabi-yau y which has kahler class (a multiple of)

[] and is related to x by op transitions. conversely, given a calabi-yau y with rational

4 we would like to thank d. morrison for pointing this out to us.

9

kahler class [] and related to x by ops, it can been shown that the transform of []

on x is movable. therefore the extended rational kahler cone is precisely the rational

cone generated by movable classes of type (1,1). we want to discuss why the property of

movability is preserved under positive linear combinations.

to see this, take two classes [1] and [2] and consider the sum [] = m[1] + n[2]
where m and n are positive rational numbers. since we may multiply [] by any integer,

we may assume that m and n are themselves integer and moreover large enough for the

following argument to apply. the corresponding line bundle is

l[] = l[1]

m  l[2]

n.

m. this denes a map
take a basis of holomorphic sections si, i = 0 . . . n1, for l[1]
n. then l[] denes a map to
to pn1 . similarly choose basis tj, j = 0 . . . n2, for l[2]
pn1n2+n1+n2 by means of the sections si  tj. thus the base locus of l[] is the union of
the base loci of l[2]

n, and in particular is of codimension at least two.

m and l[2]

so we conclude that the cone generated by movable classes is convex, and therefore

that the extended kahler cone is convex.

3.3. uniqueness in the extended cone

armed with the knowledge that the extended kahler cone is convex, we may try to

employ the argument that was used successfully in section two. we start with the local

minimum of the central charge at the attractor point k0. then on straight lines emanating
from k0 the critical points of z are all minima as long as they are inside some kahler
cone. however, a critical point may lie on the boundary between two cones in which case

our argument that it must be a minimum doesnt apply. recall that we needed the form

bij to be positive in the direction of the line. this followed from the physical requirement

of the positivity of the metric inside the moduli space, so that bij is positive-denite for
all directions tangent to the moduli space. but continuity of the metric alone does not

prevent it from acquiring a zero eigenvalue on the opping wall and so in principle bij
may become degenerate there. we are not aware of a proof of nondegeneracy of the metric

(or a counterexample). thus it may be possible for a critical point of the central charge

along a straight line to have vanishing second derivative when it lies on the wall between

two kahler cones. depending on the details of the behaviour of z  such a critical point

may be a local minimum, maximum or an inection point.

10

by the same token, it may even be that an attractor point k0 is not a local minimum of

the central charge on the extended moduli space, but rather a saddle point. we therefore

switch to a more direct argument. we will rst consider the case when k0 itself is not on

the wall and consequently it is a local minimum.

let us again examine the central charge function along a straight line (2.8) between

an attractor point k0 and some other point k1 inside the extended moduli space. if k1

were another attractor point, then it would also be a critical point of z(t) at t = 1, which

is why we will be looking at the critical points of z(t). as we know, the only source of

trouble are the points where our line crosses walls of the kahler cone. let us rst consider

the case where only a single wall is crossed between t = 0 and t = 1. suppose that the

intersection is at t = tf . rather than looking at the central charge z(t) itself, we will

examine its derivative. the derivative of z was

z (t) = (k3)4/3(cid:0)(q  k)(k3)  (q  k)(k  k  k)(cid:1) .

(3.2)

the cubic terms in the second term of z  cancel, so we put

z (t) = (k3)4/3r(t)

where r(t) is a polynomial of degree two. as (k3)4/3 is nonnegative, we will focus on

r(t). by assumption t = 0 is a local minimum for z, i.e. it is a root for r(t) where r > 0.

recall that at the attractor point we start with a positive value of the central charge.

it is important that for positive z the only physical root of r(t) is the one where the rst

derivative is positive or possibly zero if such a root is on the opping wall. the other root

of r(t) is not physical, i.e. it lies outside the original kahler cone. thus z(t) has only one

critical point in a cone, which is another proof of uniqueness for a single cone. now we

will see what happens in the adjacent cone.

first we need to know the point where z(t)  q  k(t) vanishes, call it t0. with this

denition we may write

q  k(t) = q  k0 + t q  k = q  k0 (1  t/t0)

(3.3)

when we cross the opping wall at t = tf the prepotential changes as (3.1)

k3  k3 + c(t  tf )3

11

where c > 0. so we must also modify z (t) for t > tf :

z (t)(cid:12)(cid:12)t>tf

= (k3 + c(t  tf )3)4/3(cid:0)r(t) + c(q  k  q  k0)(t  tf )2(cid:1)
= (k3 + c(t  tf )3)4/3(cid:18)r(t) + c q  k0(cid:18) tf
 1(cid:19) (t  tf )2(cid:19)
= (k3 + c(t  tf )3)4/3p (t).

t0

we are interested in the physical roots of p (t) for t  tf . as long as z(t) is positive

those are the roots where p   0. z(t) is positive for all t > 0 if t0 < 0 while if t0 > 0 it is

only positive for t < t0. in both cases the constant a  c q  k0(cid:16) tf

t0

 1(cid:17) is negative. first

we show that for a < 0 there are no physical roots of p (t) for t  tf . for that we simply

nd the root tr where p   0 and show that tr < tf . it will also imply that z(t) may not

start decreasing and therefore cannot become negative inside the extended moduli space.

we write r(t) = at2 + bt where b > 0 since t = 0 is a minimum of z. then we need

to nd roots of the quadratic equation

p (t) = at2 + bt + a(t  tf )2 = 0

the root where the derivative p (t) is nonnegative, if it exists, is always given by

tr =

2atf  b +pb2 + 4tf (a)(b + atf )

2(a + a)

then there are four cases to consider depending on the value of the coecient a.

1. a  b/tf < 0, note that a + a < 0 and b + atf < 0, see fig. 1. in this case there may

be no roots, but if there are, we have

tr <

2atf  b
2(a + a)



2atf + atf
2(a + a)

< tf .

this case is not physical, because the second root of r(t) is inside the original kahler

cone which gives unphysical maximum of the central charge. we include this case for

future reference.

what we have found is that p (t) doesnt have physical roots in the new kahler cone.

this means that z(t) doesnt have critical points there and therefore continues to grow

as we go away from the attractor. it follows that we need not consider the case when the

central charge is negative.

crossing several walls can now be handled by induction. the polynomial p (t) after

the wall plays the role of r(t) for the next crossing. we have shown that p (t) has a root

where p  > 0, but it lies to the left of the new wall, therefore we are in the same situation

as we started.

let us comment on the (im)possibility of the critical point of z(t) which lies on the

opping wall and is a local maximum. it would correspond to the situation where r and

r both vanish (recall that r cannot be negative at the critical point by continuity and

positivity of the metric away from the opping wall). such a point can be described by

a situation in item 4 above with b = 0, tf = 0 and both roots of r(t) at 0. as r(t) is
positive to the left of the wall and p (t) is negative to the right of it, this critical point is

a local maximum. however, r(t) cannot have a double zero at tf because we have shown
that it always has one root strictly to the left of the wall. therefore such critical points

do not arise.

finally, we are left to consider the case when k0 itself lies on the opping wall. then
p (t) may be either positive or negative to the right of the wall. in the former case z(t)

starts growing for t > 0 and the analysis we have made earlier carries over with no changes.

in the latter case k0 may be a local maximum in some directions precisely as described in
the previous paragraph. the dierence is that we now begin in this situation and cannot

argue that r(t) does not have a double root on the wall.

in such a case the central charge decreases from t = 0 and it may eventually become

negative. while it is still positive the rst wall crossing is described essentially by the

situation in item 1 above, with b = 0. it is then clear that p (t) will have no roots after

all subsequent wall crossings while z(t) > 0. moreover, in every cone p (t) will be a

downward-pointing parabola with the apex to the left of the left wall.

after the central charge becomes negative the discussion changes in two ways. first,

when crossing the wall the constant a in the change from r(t) to p (t) becomes positive:

r(t)  p (t) = r(t) + a(t  tf )2, a > 0.

and second, the physical critical points are now the roots of r(t) where the rst derivative

is negative or possibly zero if the root is on the opping wall.

14

now, z(t) is decreasing when it becomes negative, therefore the rst critical point

after that may only be on the wall of some cone such that r(t) has a double zero. if we

assume that this critical point exists, right before it r(t) would be a downward pointing

parabola with a double zero on the wall. we can move backwards from it and reconstruct

the polynomials r(t) and p (t) in all the preceding cones. taking into account that the

constant a is now positive but has to be subtracted, we see that while z is negative r(t)

in every cone is a downward pointing parabola with no roots and apex to the right of the

right wall. in the cone where z crosses zero we obtain a conradiction with the previous

analysis where we have found that the apex of the parabola should be to the left of the

left wall. therefore, there cannot be multiple attractor points even when they lie on the

walls between kahler cones.

4. discussion

in this paper we have demonstrated that a critical point of the central charge z is

unique if it exists. moreover, if z has a minimum (maximum) at the critical point then it

will grow (decrease) along straight lines emanating from the critical point. in this section

we will discuss two implications of our result.

if one restricts the moduli to lie inside a single kahler cone then uniqueness is not

surprising. the reason for this derives from the microscopic interpretation of entropy: it

should be possible to reproduce the entropy of a bps black hole by a microscopic count

of degenerate bps states. for the calabi-yau black holes considered in this paper, we
would have to count the degeneracy5 of holomorphic curves within the class specied by

the charge vector. as we have seen in section two, the macroscopic entropy predicted by
the attractor mechanism is s = 2
states for large charges, when supergravity should give a good description, asymptotically
approaches e 

. in [7] the count was done for the special case of elliptic threefolds.

. thus one expects that the degeneracy of bps

0

24 z

3/2
0

the attractor equation in that case could be solved explicitly and the attractor point was

therefore unique (at least in a single kahler cone). but even for a general calabi-yau

one should not have expected multiple attractor points to occur in a single kahler cone.

supergravity is well-behaved when the moduli vary only over a single cone and so the

existence of two black hole solutions with dierent entropy should have its origin in the

5 see [7] for a discussion of the correct quantity to consider.

15

possibility of counting dierent bps state degeneracies. but the number of holomorphic

curves does not change inside a kahler cone, so neither should the number of bps states.

so at least inside a single kahler cone, it is clear that the entropy should be completely

xed by specication of the charges of the black hole.

in the extended moduli space however this is not so clear: the number of curves does

change as one crosses a opping wall. one could therefore interpret the walls of a kahler

cone as a hypersurface of marginal stability, analogous to the curve of marginal stability

in seiberg-witten theory. the puzzle is this: suppose one starts with asymptotic moduli

at some point very far away from the attractor point. then somehow the attractor point

seems to be aware of the degeneracy of bps states for the calabi-yau associated with the

asymptotic moduli. but when we choose the asymptotic moduli in a cone that is dierent

from the cone where the attractor point lies, the degeneracies in the two cones will in

general not be the same, so there is no a priori reason for the absence of multiple critical

points. in the light of our result, one possibility is that the number of curves changes only

very mildly across a transition, mild enough so that the asymptotic degeneracy in the limit

of large charges is not aected. it would be interesting to check this mathematically.

the existence of multiple attractor points was also thought to be desirable for the

construction of domain walls in ve dimensional n = 2 gauged supergravity, along the

lines of [13].

in that setup the goal is not to minimise the central charge, but to nd

extrema of the scalar potential of gauged supergravity, which is

v = 6(w 2 

3
4

gijiw jw ).

in the above, w = qiki where ki are the usual kahler moduli and qi are the gravitino
and gaugino charges under the u (1) that is being gauged. even though the interpretation

is dierent, w is numerically the same as what we have called z before and the supersym-

metric critical points of v are also critical points of w [5]. at a critical point w0 of w the
ve dimensional supergravity solution is anti-de sitter space with cosmological constant
equal to 6w 2

0 . to construct a domain wall, one would like to have two critical points
k0 and k1 of w . then one could write down a supergravity solution that interpolates
between two dierent anti-de sitter vacua, with the asymptotic values of the moduli being

k0 on one side of the wall and k1 on the other. it was hoped that this might lead to a
supergravity realisation of the randall-sundrum scenario [14]. unfortunately as we have

seen, this construction does not appear to be possible, at least in its simplest form, because

of the absence of multiple (supersymmetric) critical points.

16

finally, the attractor mechanism in four dimensions is somewhat similar to the ve

dimensional mechanism considered in this paper. it would be interesting if our methods

could be used to shed some light on this important problem as well.
