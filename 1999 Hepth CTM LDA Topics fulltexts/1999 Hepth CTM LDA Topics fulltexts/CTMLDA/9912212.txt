(one notice, however, also take = f + c, c central element obeying c = 0.) let us consider (1, 2)-bimodule p 1 q-algebra respect operator q1 2 q-algebra respect operator q2. say operator p : p p connection bimodule p p (ax) = (1)deg ap (x) + q1a x p (xb) = p x b + (1)deg x xq2b x p, 1, b 2. words, p connection respect 1 respect 2 time. follows statements every -module e equipped connection considered (ende, )- bimodule connection bimodule. using (1, 2)-bimodule p assign every (right ) 1-module e (right) 2-module e taking tensor product p : e = e 1 p (6) (to take tensor product 1 identify ea p e ap standard tensor product e c p . e e, p p, 1.) 6 connection p bimodule p transfer connection e connection e. namely, every connection e dene operator 1 + 1 p e c p . easy check operator compatible identication ea p e ap therefore descends operator : e e. operator considered connection 2-module e. easy relate curvatures connections . take account correspondence e e natural, i.e. every endomorphism end1e assign e (the map 1 : e c p e c endomorphism end2 p descends endomorphism : e e). particular, curvature f () end1e determines endomorphism ^f () e. one verify curvature f ( ) connection end2 e represented form: f ( ) = ^f () + , (7) xed element end2 e . verify (7) notice 2 1 + 1 1 : e c p e c p descends endomorphism ^f () : e e 2 1 + 1 2 p + 12 descends f ( ) : e e. using relation 11 = 11 obtain map = f ( ) ^f ()is induced map = 1 : e c p e c p map : p p given formula = 2 p + 1 + 2. easy check end1p end2p (8) (i.e. (ax) = a(x), (xb) = (x)b x p, 1, b 2). check commutes 1 represent form = \f1(p ) + 2, f1(p ) stands curvature p considered 1-connection; representation = \f2(p ) + 1 used prove end2p . follows (8) = 1 descends e gives 2-endomorphism . one notice facts clear also representation = f ( ) ^f (). 7 illustrate statements start arbitrary q-algebra arbitrary -module p connection p . consider p (1, 2)-bimodule, 1 = endp, 2 = . (we seen 1 = endp q-algebra respect operator q =  p connection also respect q-algebra.) follows calculations f = f2(p ) = 2 p + 2, 1 = f therefore = f + 1 = 0. (we obtain result noticing f1(2) = 2 p + 1 = (f 1 = 2.) see situation = 0; hence, f ( ) = ^f (). (however, noticed one modify denition q-algebra endp adding central element c c = 0 1; 6= 0.) would like give conditions gauge theories 1- module e 2 -module e equivalent. establish equivalence need (1, 2)-bimodule p equipped connection p . bimodule permits us transfer modules connec- tions opposite direction. constructions obtained means p inverse constructions specied p say bimodules p, p give morita equivalence q-algebras 1 2 (or morita equivalence bimodules). course, notion general- izes standard notion morita equivalence associative alge- bras, use operator q connections. def- inition morita equivalence bimodules reformulated following constructive way. let us suppose exist two bilinear scalar products p p taking values 1 2 respectively. assume scalar products 2-invariant 1-invariant correspondingly. words, assume p p, p p < p, p >1 1, < p, p >2 2 < p, p >1=< p, p >1 2, < p1, p >2=< p, 1p >2 1 1. require also 1 < p, p >1 2 =< 1p, p2 >1, 1 < p, p >2 2 =< 1p, p2 >2 (9) (10) 1 p , 1, 2. scalar products p1 < p, p >1=< p1, p >2 p, < p, p >2 p p, p1 p, p, p determine maps 1 = p < p, p 1 >1 : p 2 p 1, : p 1 p 2. consider p 2 p 1 (1, 1)-bimodules; 8 follows (9), homomorphism bimodules; similarly homomorphism (2, 2)-bimodules. require isomorphisms. (e 1 p ) 2 p = e 1 (p 2 p ) = e 1 1 = e every 1-module e. statement together similar state- ment 2-modules gives us one-to-one correspondence 1-modules 2-modules (more precisely gives us equivalence categories 1-modules 2-modules). obtain one-to-one correspondence connections impose additional requirements < p p, p >1 + < p, p p >1= q < p, p >1, (11) < p p, p >2 + < p, p p >2= q < p, p >2 follows assumptions operator p 1 + 1 p p c p descends operator q p 2 p . using q1 = 0 obtain operator 1 + 1 q e c 1 descends e 1 1 = e. means going 1-connections 2-connections back obtain original 1-connection. fact together similar statement 2-connections gives one- to-one correspondence 1-connections 2-connections. see conditions equivalence gauge theories 1-module e 2-module e (duality). describe later duality gauge theories noncommu- tative tori obtained way. let us study connections projective -modules q-algebra. first easy construct connection arbitrary projective -module e. namely, e specied means projec- tion e : n n (i.e. en = e) construct connection e (so called levi-civita connection) means formula = eqe q acts n componentwise.
