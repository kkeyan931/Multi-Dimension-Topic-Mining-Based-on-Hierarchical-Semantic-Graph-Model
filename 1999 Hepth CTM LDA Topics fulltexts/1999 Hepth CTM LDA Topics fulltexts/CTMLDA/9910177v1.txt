abstract

we construct non-standard interactions between exterior form gauge elds by gauging
a particular global symmetry of the einstein-maxwell action for such elds. further
gauge theories of the same type with couplings to scalar elds are then obtained by
dimensional reduction. the construction uses an appropriate tensor calculus.

introduction

exterior form gauge elds ap = (1/p!) dx1. . . dxpa1...p generalize naturally the elec-
tromagnetic gauge potential and are therefore interesting on general grounds in the
context of gauge theories.
in particular they play a substantial role in supergrav-
ity models and string theory. it is therefore natural to study consistent interactions
of such gauge elds, both the interactions between themselves and their couplings to
other elds.
in this paper we construct non-standard interactions between exterior form gauge elds,
both without and with couplings to scalar elds. this is done in curved spacetime, i.e.,
the (standard) coupling to the gravitational eld is included as well. our starting point
is the einstein-maxwell action for a p-form gauge eld ap and an (n  p  1)-form
gauge eld anp1 in n-dimensional spacetime (for arbitrary p and n). this action has
a global symmetry which shifts ap by the hodge dual of the eld strength of anp1, and
anp1 by the hodge dual of the eld strength of ap (with an appropriate sign factor,
see below). we gauge this global symmetry, using an additional 1-form gauge eld
v = dxv. this yields inevitably interactions which are non-polynomial in the v. it
would therefore be cumbersome to construct these interactions in a pedestrian way via
the standard noether procedure. instead, we employ an appropriate tensor calculus
which is analogous to the one introduced in [1] in at four-dimensional spacetime.
by formulating this tensor calculus in the dierential form language we simplify the
construction considerably as compared to the formulation in terms of components used
in [1]. from the resulting models we then derive further ones by standard kaluza-klein

type dimensional reduction. this yields models with non-standard interactions between
p-form gauge elds and scalar elds.
our work is linked to recent progress in four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theo-
ries, and theories with exterior form gauge elds in general. to our knowledge, gauge
theories of the type constructed here appeared for the rst time in [2]. there four-
dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories were constructed in which the cen-
tral charge of the vector-tensor multiplet is gauged. this central charge is a global
symmetry of the type described above and therefore the models found in [2] contain
interactions of the same non-standard type as those we shall obtain. further four-
dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories of the same type were constructed
in [3]. independently of these developments related to the n = 2 vector-tensor multi-
plet, models of the type considered here, and generalizations thereof, were discovered
in [4] (along with further new interactions of exterior form gauge elds) within a sys-
tematic classication of possible consistent interaction vertices of exterior form gauge
elds. four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric versions of some of the models found
in [4] were constructed in [5]. our work thus adds to the list of new gauge theories in
these references.

the model

the properly normalized einstein-maxwell action for ap and anp1 is1

s0 =

1

2 z (cid:2)()(p+1)(n1) dap  dap + ()p(n1) danp1  danp1(cid:3) .

(1)

here we use the following conventions for a p-form p and its hodge dual:

p =

1
p!

dx1 . . . dxp 1...p

 p =

dx1 . . . dxnp 1...nnp+1...n ,

1

p!(n  p)!

where indices are raised with the inverse metric g, and the curved levi-civita tensor
is dened by (x1 labels the time coordinate)

12...n = 

g , g =  det g .

one should of course add the einstein action to s0, which however we shall not write
explicitly.
s0 has among others a global symmetry generated by

ap =  danp1 , anp1 = ()n(p+1)  dap .

(2)

we will now try to gauge this symmetry. to do this, we search for a modied generator
, such that ap and anp1 transform covariantly under gauge transformations

ap = g ap ,

anp1 = g anp1 ,

(3)

1operators such as the exterior derivative and the hodge star are understood to act only on the

object to their immediate right!

2

where  is an arbitrary scalar eld and g a coupling constant of mass dimension 1.
a reasonable ansatz is to replace the exterior derivative in (2) with a covariant one. let
us therefore introduce a connection 1-form v with the standard transformation law

and a covariant derivative

v = d

d = d  gv  ,

where  is the covariant version of (2),

ap =  danp1 , anp1 = ()n(p+1)  dap .

(4)

(5)

(6)

these equations give the action of  only implicitly because d involves . we now
determine the covariant derivatives dap and danp1. starting with the former, we
have

dap = dap  gv  danp1

= dap  gv (cid:2)danp1 + ()n(p+1)g v  dap(cid:3) .

using the identity

(v  p) = ()np iv p ,

iv = v 



(dx)

,

(7)

which holds for any p-form p (where v  = gv), this gives

dap = dap  gv  danp1  g2v iv dap .

to solve for dap, we have to invert the operator 1 + g2v iv . with (v iv )2 = v v v iv ,
it is easily veried that

(1 + g2v iv )1 = 1  g2e 1v iv , e = 1 + g2v v ,

and we obtain

dap = dap  ge 1v(cid:2)  danp1 + g iv dap(cid:3) .

analogously, one nds

danp1 = danp1  ge 1v(cid:2)  ()n(p+1)  dap + g iv danp1(cid:3) .

note that due to the appearance of e 1 the covariant derivatives, and thus the gauge
transformations, of ap and anp1 are non-polynomial in the connection v and the
coupling constant g.
as can be checked, dap and danp1 are indeed covariant, i.e. their gauge transfor-
mations do not involve derivatives of , and one has

(8)

(9)

(10)

 dap = g dap = g d  danp1

3

 danp1 = g danp1 = ()n(p+1)g d  dap .

(11)

now we can proceed to construct the gauge invariant action. to do this, we use the
following fact: let x be a covariant volume form which transforms according to x =
g dk, with k a covariant (n  1)-form. then x + g v k transforms into a total
derivative,

x = g dk ,

k = g k  (x + g v k) = d(g k) .

in particular, thanks to (11) this applies to

x = ()(p+1)(n1) dap  dap + ()p(n1) danp1  danp1

with

adding a kinetic term for the connection v , the action thus reads

k = 2()np  dap  danp1 .

s =

1

2 z (cid:0)x + g v k + dv  dv(cid:1) ,

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

with x and k as in (13) and (14). by construction, s is a surface term, with the
transformations as in (3), (4) and g = 0. furthermore, the action is invariant under
the standard abelian gauge transformations of ap and anp1,

ap = dp1 ,

anp1 = dnp2 ,

(16)

since these elds enter the covariant derivatives (9), (10) only via their exterior deriva-
tives.

alternatively, one may consider a rst order formulation. introducing auxiliary elds
p and np1, with the form degree as indicated, the action is given by

s =

1

2 z (cid:2)dv  dv + ()p(n1) p  p + ()(p+1)(n1) np1  np1

+ 2p danp1  2()n(p+1)np1 dap  2()pg v pnp1(cid:3) ,

while the gauge transformations read

v = d ,

ap = g p ,

anp1 = g np1

p = np1 = g = 0 .

(17)

(18)

the equations of motion for the auxiliary elds are coupled in exactly the same way as
the equations that determine the covariant derivatives of ap and anp1 (the relation
 denotes on-shell equality),

()p(n1)  p  danp1  g v np1
()p  np1  dap  g v p ,

(19)

4

and the solutions are thus

p  ap ,

np1  anp1 .

(20)

the action (17) may also be used to derive a dual version of our model. to that
end one solves the equations of motion for ap and anp1 through p  dap1 and
np1  danp2 and inserts the solution back into the action. the interaction vertex
v pnp1 then turns into a chern-simons term.

remark. if n = 1 + 4k and p = 2k, one may identify ap with anp1. for instance, in
the case n = 5, p = 2 one then gets a 5-dimensional theory involving only one 2-form
gauge eld besides v and the gravitational eld.

dimensional reduction

the model introduced above admits some generalization. in what follows, we show how
a dimensional reduction from n to n 1 dimensions gives rise to couplings to additional
gauge elds and scalars.
we denote the coordinates by

x = (xa, xn) ,

a = 1, . . . , n  1 ,

(21)

and take all elds to be constant along the xn-direction. then the metric decomposes
in the usual manner,

g dx  dx = gab dxa  dxb + e2(w + dxn)  (w + dxn) ,

(22)

where w = dxawa is a 1-form in n  1 dimensions.
upon dimensional reduction, ap gives rise to a p-form ap and a (p1)-form ap1, while
anp1 decomposes into an (n  p  1)-form anp1 and an (n  p  2)-form anp2.
the connection v introduces in addition to a 1-form v a scalar eld ,

ap = ap + ap1 dxn , anp1 = anp1 + anp2 dxn ,

v = v +  dxn .

(23)

in the following, one should keep in mind that the descendants ap, anp1 and v all
transform nontrivially under the abelian gauge transformation associated with w , while
ap1, anp2 and  are invariant,

w = d ,

 ap = ap1 d ,

 anp1 = anp2 d ,

 v =  d

 ap1 =  anp2 =  = 0 .

(24)

 originates from a general coordinate transformation in the nth direction.
when decomposing the dual of a p-form p, we make use of the relation

 p = e  p1 + ()p e  (p  p1w ) (w + dxn) ,

where the hodge star  in n  1 dimensions involves the reduced levi-civita tensor
a1...an1 = e a1...an1n and indices are raised with gab.

5

there are now two ways of determining the covariant derivatives and gauge transforma-
tions of the a-elds, which turn out to give the same results. one may either start from
the rst order formulation and solve the dimensionally reduced equations of motion for
the auxiliary elds, or one may directly decompose the equations (9) and (10). let us
follow the latter approach: we dene a covariant derivative d by the relations

dap = d ap + d ap1 dxn , danp1 = d anp1 + d anp2 dxn .

(25)

the decomposition of the left-hand sides is straightforward, and by comparison of the
terms with and without dxn one derives the action of d on the four gauge elds.
similarly to the gauge elds themselves, the descendants d ap and d anp1 transform
noncovariantly under . it is convenient to use -invariant generalized eld strengths
instead, analogous to those appearing in kaluza-klein supergravity models [6],

fp+1 = d ap  d ap1 w , fnp = d anp1  d anp2 w .

(26)

then also the connection v appears always in a -invariant combination, which we
denote by

since the original n-dimensional elds do not appear anymore, we shall omit all hats
in the following. explicitly, one nds

u = v  w .

(27)

fp+1 = dap  dap1 w  ge 1u(cid:2)e  danp2 + g iu (dap  dap1 w )
+ ()pg e2 dap1(cid:3)
fnp = danp1  danp2 w  ge 1u(cid:2)  ()n(p+1)e  dap1
+ g iu (danp1  danp2 w )  ()npg e2 danp2(cid:3) ,

(28)

and

dap1 = dap1  ge 1u(cid:2)()npe (danp1  danp2 w ) + g iu dap1(cid:3)

 ge 1(cid:2)()pe  danp2 + ()pg iu (dap  dap1 w )
+ g e2 dap1(cid:3)

danp2 = danp2  ge 1u(cid:2)  ()(p+1)(n1)e (dap  dap1 w ) + g iu danp2(cid:3)

 ge 1(cid:2)()p(n1)e  dap1  ()npg iu (danp1  danp2 w )
+ g e2 danp2(cid:3) ,

where now

e = 1 + g2u aua + g2e22 .

(29)

(30)

the above expressions enter the gauge transformations  of the forms ap etc., which
are found to read

ap = g (cid:2)e  danp2 + ()npe fnpw(cid:3)

6

ap1 = ()npg  e fnp
anp1 = ()n(p+1)g (cid:2)e  dap1  ()pe  fp+1w(cid:3)
anp2 = ()(p+1)(n1)g  e fp+1 ,

while those of the remaining elds are simply

u = d ,

 = w =  =  gab = 0 .

(31)

(32)

we observe that dap1 and danp2 contain terms which are accompanied by the
scalar  rather than the connection u. one may introduce minimal covariant deriva-
tives d of ap1 and anp2 by subtracting appropriate covariant terms from dap1
and danp2,

dap1 = dap1 + ()pg e  danp2

danp2 = danp2 + ()p(n1)g e  dap1 .

this results in the following simpler expressions:

dap1 = dap1  ge 1u(cid:2)()npe e (danp1  danp2 w ) + g iu dap1
danp2 = danp2  ge 1u(cid:2)  ()(p+1)(n1)e e (dap  dap1 w )

 ()pg2e iu  danp2(cid:3)

+ g iu danp2  ()p(n1)g2 iu  dap1(cid:3) ,

where e is a function of the scalar elds only,

e = 1 + g2e22 .

(33)

(34)

(35)

eqs. (33) can be inverted to express dap1 and danp2 in terms of the minimal
covariant derivatives,

dap1 = e 1(cid:2)dap1  ()pg e danp2(cid:3)
danp2 = e 1(cid:2)danp2  ()p(n1)g e dap1(cid:3) .

(36)

finally, we obtain the gauge invariant action in (n  1)-dimensional spacetime by re-
duction of eq. (15). using the eqs. (26), (27) and (36), it can be written entirely in
terms of -invariant as well as -covariant expressions,

s =

1

2 z ne(du +  dw ) (du +  dw ) + ()ned  d

+ ()n(p+1) e(cid:0)fp+1  fp+1 + fnp fnp(cid:1)
+ ()np e 1e(cid:0)dap1  dap1 + danp2  danp2(cid:1)
 2g e 1u(cid:0) dap1  fnp  ()n(p+1) danp2  fp+1(cid:1)
 2()p(n1)g2e 1e u(cid:0)danp2  fnp  ()ndap1 fp+1(cid:1)

7

+ 2()pg e 1e2 dap1danp2o .

(37)

as compared to (15), the new feature of the action (37) is the coupling of ,  and
w . indeed, if we set these elds to zero, (37) reduces to an action of the form (15) in
n = n  1 dimensions, for two pairs of exterior form gauge elds with form degrees
(p, n  p  1) and (p  1, n  p): one gets (15) with x = x1 + x2 and k = k1 + k2,
where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the rst and second pair respectively (xi and ki
match their counterparts in (13) and (14) up to sign factors which can be removed by
trivial eld redenitions a  a). clearly, one may iterate the dimensional reduction
procedure to derive more involved models of the above type. again, after setting to
zero scalar and vector elds coming from g and v , the resulting actions reduce to
the form (15) for more pairs of exterior form gauge elds.

comments

to understand the structure of the models, it is useful to keep in mind that they are
consistent deformations of the standard einstein-maxwell action for exterior form gauge
elds, plus kinetic terms for the scalar elds in the models obtained by dimensional
reduction. the non-polynomial structure of the interactions can be traced back to the
properties of the global symmetry (2) that is gauged.
namely, the rst order deformation s1 of the n-dimensional einstein-maxwell action is

given by s1 = ()npr v  dap  danp1. this is nothing but the noether coupling
v j, where the (n  1)-form j is the noether current of the global symmetry (2). the
corresponding rst order deformation of the gauge symmetry involves the global sym-
metry (2): it is just 1 =  (i.e., 1ap =   danp1, 1anp1 = ()n(p+1)  dap).
it can be readily checked that 1s1 does not vanish, due to the fact that j is not invari-
ant under . as a consequence, consistency of the interactions at second order makes
it necessary to introduce second order deformations both of the action and of the gauge
symmetry (this can be rigorously proved by cohomological arguments along the lines
of [7]). this extends to all higher orders and leads to the non-polynomial structure of
the interactions and gauge transformations.
in fact the situation is somewhat similar to the coupling of the gravitational eld to
matter in standard gravity. indeed, viewed as a deformation using g =  + m1
pl h,
the rst order deformation couples h to the energy momentum tensor t  in at
spacetime. t  is the noether current of translations and not invariant under the
generators of translations given by the spacetime derivatives. this leads to interactions
that are non-polynomial in h and in the coupling constant m1
pl which are compactly
constructed by means of the familiar tensor calculus.
the non-standard coupling of the scalar elds present in the dimensionally reduced
models can be understood analogously from the point of view of consistent deformations.
if we specialize these models by setting w and  to zero, the rst order coupling of

the scalar eld  is just r  dap1danp2 (up to a factor), i.e., it couples  to the

topological density dap1danp2. again, the latter is not invariant under the rst
order deformation 1 of the gauge symmetry. this enforces further interaction terms
of higher order, with higher powers of , and eventually non-polynomial interactions

8

of . analogous statements apply in presence of w and , where further rst order
interactions are present. one may disentangle the various couplings in these interactions
by introducing further coupling constants g1 and g2 through the rescalings w  g1w ,
  g2.
hence, though one might have suspected that the non-polynomial interactions of the
scalar elds (and of w ) in the above models are just an artefact of the dimensional
reduction, such interactions are actually to be expected in gauge theories of the type
studied here, whether or not the models can be obtained by dimensional reduction. in
fact, the reader may check that non-polynomial interactions of scalar elds similar to
those found here are present in all supersymmetric models constructed in [2, 3, 5].
