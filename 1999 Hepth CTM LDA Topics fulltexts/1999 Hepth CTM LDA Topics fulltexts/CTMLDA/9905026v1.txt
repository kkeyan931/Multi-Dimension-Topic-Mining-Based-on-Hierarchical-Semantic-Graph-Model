abstract

the ane sl2 toda model coupled to matter eld is treated as a constrained system in
the context of faddeev-jackiw and the (constrained) symplectic schemes. we recover from
this theory either, the sine-gordon or the massive thirring model, through a process of
hamiltonian reduction, considering the equivalence of the noether and topological currrents
as a constraint and symmetry breaking of the conformal symmetry.

1 introduction

the dirac method [1] has been a standard method to deal with constrained systems for a long
time. by using his approach one can obtain the dirac brackets which are the bridges to the
commutators in quantum theory. a few years ago, faddeev and jackiw (fj)[2, 3] proposed
a method of symplectic quantization of constrained systems for a rst order lagrangian,
which appeared as an alternative to the traditional and succesful diracs approach. in the fj
method, the classication of constraints as rst or second class, primary or secondary, is not
necessary. it works, roughly, by solving the constraints and reducing the phase space of the
system to the independent degrees of freedom. in [4] a constructive procedure for obtaining
the canonical variables was proposed. an interesting variation inside the fj method, known
as symplectic quantization is due to wotzasek, montani and barcelos-neto [5, 7, 9, 10].
following the spirit of diracs work, this proposal works by imposing the stability of the
constraints under time evolution. so, constraints are not solved but embedded in an extended
phase space. this is a more suitable approach when some relevant symmetries must be
preserved [5]. by now it is becoming clear that these new methods to quantize classical
systems have superseded diracs, being both simpler and more fundamental.

in addition, integrable theories in two-dimensions have been an extraordinary laboratory
for the understanding of basic nonperturbative aspects of physical theories. in the present
paper we study the recently proposed ane sl(2) toda model coupled to (dirac) matter
eld which is an example of a wide class of integrable theories presented in [11]. the zero
curvature representation, the construction of the general solution and many other properties
are discussed in [11]. the quantum aspects of the model as well as the solitonic solutions
are dicussed in [17]. this model possesses a noether current depending only on the matter
eld. under some circunstances, it is possible to choose one solution in each orbit of the
conformal group such that, for these solutions, the u(1) current is equal to a topological
current depending only on the toda eld. such equivalence leads, at the classical level, to
the localization of the matter eld inside the soliton, and an additional feature; the masses
of solitons and particles are proportional to the u(1) noether charge. these facts indicate
the existence of a sort of duality in these models involving solitons and particles [12].

here we carry out the classical analysis of the theory, once, the conformal invariance is
explicitly broken by suitable choosing a classical vaccum for an auxiliary eld, and imposed
the equivalence of the noether and topological currents as a constraint which is incorporated
to the action by means of lagrange multipliers. it is interesting to see how the fj and the
constrained symplectic methods work in the analysis of the phase space of this submodel.
using these methods we show that this submodel turns out to be a parent lagrangian [13]
from which the sine-gordon and the massive thirring models are derivable. we thus show
that there are (at least classically) two equivalent descriptions of this submodel, using either
the dirac or the toda eld. it will be also clear the duality exchange of the coupling regimes:
g  1/g.
the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we make a brief review of both the fj
and (constrained) symplectic formalisms. in section 3 we present some relevant aspects of
the ane sl(2) toda model coupled to matter eld. section 4 deals with the (hamilto-
nian) reduction of the constrained version of the model in the original fj [3] framework; the

1

constraint is solved and darbouxs transformations are used to diagonalize the canonical
sector of the theory. this reduction process results in the massive thirring model. in section
5 we attack the same problem from the point of view of symplectic quantization [5, 7, 9, 10];
where the constraints are not solved but considered as strong relations into the symplectic
potential, and, simultaneously, incorporated to the canonical part by using lagrange multi-
pliers which are velocities. the outcome of this analysis is the poisson brackets of either, the
massive thirring model or the sine-gordon system, derived by gauge xing the symmetries
of the model in two dierent ways.

2 the faddeev-jackiw formalism

the faddeev-jackiw (f-j) approach [2, 3] avoids the separation of the constraints into rst
and second class and gives us a straightforward way to deal with constraint systems. a brief
summary of this method is given below1. let us start with a rst order in time derivative
lagrangian which may arise from a conventional second order one after the introduction of
auxiliary elds. the general form of such a lagrangian is

l = ai() i  v ().

(1)

where the coordinates i, with i = 1, ..., n, stand for the generalized coordinates. no-
tice that when a hamiltonian is dened by the usual legendre transformations, v may be
identied with the hamiltonian h.

this rst order system is characterized by a closed two-form.

if the two-form is not
degenerated, it denes a symplectic structure on the phase space m, described by the co-
ordinates i. on the other hand, if the two-form is singular, with constant rank on m, it
is called a presymplectic two-form [14]. thus, in terms of components, the (pre)symplectic
form is dened by

fij() =


i aj() 


j ai()

(2)

with the vector potential ai() being an arbitrary function of i. the euler-lagrange equa-
tions are given by

fij j =


i v ().

(3)

in the non-singular, unconstrained case the anti-symmetric nxn matrix fij has the

matrix inverse f ij, then n = 2n, and (3) implies

and the bracket will be dened by

i = f ij 

j v ()

{i , j} = f ij

(4)

(5)

1in this section we use nite degree of freedom. the extension to the innite degree of freedom case can

be done in a straightforward way.

2

in the case that the lagrangian (1) describes a constrained system, the matrix f ij is
singular which means that there is a set of relations between the velocities reducing the
degrees of freedom of the system. let us suppose that the rank of f is 2n, so there exist
n  2n = n  zero modes v,  = 1, ..., n . the system is then constrained by n  equations
in which no time-derivatives appear. then there will be constraints that reduce the number
of degres of freedom of the theory. multiplying (3) by the (left) zero-modes v
i of fij we get

i fij j = v
v

i

v ()

i

= 0.

these (symplectic) constraints appear as algebraic relations

  v

v ()

i

= 0.

(6)

(7)

by using darbouxs theorem [3, 14] one can show that an arbitrary vector potential, ai,
whose associated eld strength fij is non-singular, can be mapped by a coordinate trans-
formation onto a potential of the form ai() = 1
2 jwji with wji a constant and non-singular
matrix. then, the darboux construction may still be carried out for the non-singular pro-
jection of fij given in (2). then the lagrangian becomes

l =

1
2

iwij j  v (, z)

(8)

where z denote the n  2n coordinates that are left unchanged. some of the zs may appear
non-linearly and some linearly in (8). then using the euler-lagrange equation for these
coordinates we can solve for as many zs as possible in term of s and other zs and replace
back in v (, z) so nally we are left only with linearly occuring zs. so, we can write the
lagrangian in the form

l =

1
2

iwij j  v ()  kk(),

(9)

where we have renamed the linearly occuring zs as k. we see that these k become the
lagrange multipliers and k() are the constraints. to incorporate the constraints we solve
the equations

k() = 0

(10)

and replace back in (9). this procedure reduce the number of s and we end up with
a lagrangian which has the structure given in (1). then the whole procedure can be re-
peated again until all constraints are eliminated and we are left with a completely reduced,
unconstrained and canonical system.

2.1 the constrained symplectic formalism

there may be technical diculties in performing all the steps of the f-j formalism: solv-
ing the constraints may prove too dicult, constructing the darboux transformations may
not be possible. an analysis from the point of view of the so called symplectic reduction
procedure has been proposed by the authors of [5, 7, 9, 10], avoiding the dicult darboux

3

transformation implied in the original analysis of f-j by expanding, at each stage of the
algorithm, the number of variables in the phase space. the central idea in this modied
method is to include the constraints into the lagrangian by means of lagrange multipliers
that are velocities, which must be added to the set of dynamical variables, enlarging the
conguration space. once the constraints (7) have been identied, and introduced as strong
relations in the symplectic potential v (), one can always rearrange the lagrangian (1) in
the form

l = ai(q) qi +    v (q),

(11)

where i = 1, ..., n and  = 1, ..., m. the coordinates qi describe the non singular sector
of l, so that the matrix fij(qi) = 
j ai(qi) is invertible. then n must be
qi
even. the new canonical structure is obtained by constructing the matrix f 
ab, (a, b =
1, ..., n, n+1, ..., n+m) associated to this lagrangian l. if the resulting matrix is nonsingular,
the generalized brackets are dened by its inverse. in other case, the whole procedure can be
repeated again until the last f matrix be regular. for gauge invariant theories, the algorithm
is not able to provide a non singular matrix. to obtain the bracket structure one must include
a gauge xing condition in the symplectic potential as a symmetry breaking term.

the equivalence of the fj approach to the dirac method is discussed in [6, 7, 8]. some
applications of the original fj and the symplectic quantization methods can be found in
[22] and the extension to the fermionic case for constant symplectic structures is accomplished
in [6].

the theory (12) was proposed in [11] as an example of a wide class of integrable theories
called ane toda systems coupled to matter elds2. the zero curvature representation, the
construction of the general solution including the solitonic ones and many other properties
were discussed in [11, 17]. we start by reviewing the symmetries of (12).

(22)

where  = 1.
now comes a very interesting property of this model. the conservation of the u(1) vector
current (18) and of the chiral current (20) can be used to show that there are two charges
given by

j = iet (1 + 5)  + +,

5

j = iet (1  5)  + 

(23)

satisfying

(24)
notice, from (14), that the currents j and j have conformal weights (1, 0) and (0, 1) re-
spectively. one can now perform a (hamiltonian) reduction of the model by imposing the
constraints

j = 0 ;

+ j = 0.

j = 0 ;

j = 0.

(25)

the degree of freedom eliminated by such reduction does not correspond to the excitations
of any of the elds appearing in the lagragian (12). as it was shown in [17], at the quantum
level, it corresponds to the excitations of a free eld which is a non-linear combination of
those in (12).

one can easily check that the constraints (25) are equivalent to

1
2i

  =

.

(26)

therefore, in the reduced model, the noether current (18) is proportional to the topological
current (21).

this fact has profound consequences in the properties of such theory. for instance, it
implies that the charge density  is proportional to the space derivative of . conse-
quently, the dirac eld is conned to live in regions where the eld  is not constant. the
best example of that is the one-soliton solution of (12) which was calculated in [11].

the solution for  is exactly a sine-gordon type soliton, and  is a solution of the
massive thirring model [18]; therefore, one can see that x and the noether charge j0 are
non-vanishing only in a region of size of the order of m1
 . in addition, one can check that
this solution satises (26), and so is a solution of the reduced model. therefore, the dirac
eld must be conned inside the soliton. the study of the two-soliton solutions is performed
in [17].

however such results are true at the classical level. the study of the quantum aspects of
the model using bosonization techniques [19] are presented in [17]. witten has considered
a similar model in [15], originally proposed by kogut and sinclair [16]. their model diers
from (12) in two points: i) it does not contain the pair of elds (, ), and therefore is not
conformal invariant; ii) the sign of the kinetic term of the  eld in (12) is negative.

in the following sections we will consider the reduced version of the model (12) by set-
ting  = const., such that by suitable choosing the classical vacuum by setting  = const,
conformal invariance is explicitely broken. this vacuum solution for the eld  was used in
[11, 17] to perform the dressing transformation in order to obtain soliton solutions, which
are in the orbit of a vacuum solution. it can be also noticed that these transformations do
not excite the eld  and the solitonic solutions are solutions of the reduced model.

4 the fj formalism and the massive thirring model

as it was discussed in the last section we will consider the following lagrangian with the 
eld in (12) replaced by 0 =const.

kl(, , , ) =

(27)

where we have incorporated the noether and topological currents equivalence (26) by adding
to the lagangian the term (2  ), where  are lagrange multipliers. the
same procedure has been used, for example, to incorporate the left-moving condition for the
boson in the study of chiral bosons in two dimensions [21]. in order to write (27) in the rst
order form (1), let us dene the conjugated momenta

 =

1
2

 + 1,

 = 0,

r = ir,

l = il.

(28)

we are assuming that the dirac elds are anticommuting grasmannian variables and
their momenta variables dened through left derivatives. then, as usual, the hamiltonian
is dened by

hc =   + r
explicitely the hamiltonian density becomes

r + l

l  l.

(29)

hc = 2

l  2i1j1  21  0(2ij0  ) + (30)

now, the same legendre transform (29) is used to write the rst order lagrangian

l =   + r

r + l

l  hc.

(31)

our starting point for the f-j analysis will be this rst order lagrangian. the lagrangian
(31) is already in the form (1), and the euler-lagrange equations for the lagrange multipliers
allow us to solve one of them

and the other equation leads to one constraint

1 = ij1 + ,

1  2ij0   = 0.

(32)

(33)

then, the lagrange multiplier 1 must be replaced back in (31) and the constraint (33)

solved. firstly, let us replace the 1 multiplier into hc, then one gets

then the new lagrangian becomes

(34)

(35)

one can implement the constraint by replacing in this lagrangian the eld  in terms of the
space integral of the current component j0. notice that in the interaction terms there will
arise a complicated non-local expressions. thus we get the following lagrangian

l = tz x

notice the appearence of the current-current interaction term. the following darboux trans-
formations

with the 

(37)
 momenta convenientely chosen, is used to diagonalize the canonical one-form.

we are, thus, after dening k  2/g, and rescaling the eld   1/k, left with the

(38)

which is just the massive thirring model. the canonical pairs are (ier, r) and (iel, l).
5 the constrained symplectic formalism and the mas-

sive thirring system

now let us study our model in the framework of the symplectic formalism.
in order to
perform this analysis we will start from the rst order lagrangian eq. (35) (l is considered
as the zeroth-iterated lagrangian l(0)), written as5
r + l

(39)

l + 11  v (1),

l(1) =   + r

where the once-iterated symplectic potential is
v (1) = h

or explicitly

v (1) = [(j1)2  2ij1 +

r + iel

l +

ime0(e2 erl  e2 elr)]|1=0

and the stability condition of the symplectic constraint 1 under time evolution has been
implemented by doing 0  1. consider the once-iterated set of symplectic variables in the
following order
(42)

(1)
a = (1, , r, l, , r, l)

and the components of the canonical one-form

these result in the following singular symplectic two-form matrix

a(1)
a = (1, , r, l, 0, 0, 0).

5the superscript index is written in accordance to the iterative character of the constrained symplectic

formalism.

this matrix has a zero mode

v(1)t

(x) = (cid:16)u, 0,2ur,2ul,u,2iuer,2iuel(cid:17)

where u is an arbitrary function. the zero-mode condition, eq. (7) gives

z dxv(1)t

(x)



(x) z dyv (1)  0.

(45)

(46)

then the gradient of the symplectic potential happens to be orthogonal to the zero-mode
v(1). the equations of motion are automatically validated, and no symplectic constraint
appear. this happens due to the presence of the following symmetry of the action

1 = u,  = 0,  = u, r = 2ur, l = 2ul,
r = 2iuer, l = 2iul.

(47)

so, in order to deform the symplectic matrix into an invertible one, we have to add a gauge
xing term to the symplectic potential. one can choose any consitent gauge xing condition
[7]. in this case we have one symmetry generator associated to the parameter u, so there
must be one gauge condition. let us choose the gauge

2   = 0.

(48)

by doing this we are gauging away the  eld, so only the remaining eld variables will
describe the dynamics of the system. other gauge conditions, which gauge away the  eld
will be imposed in the next subsection. implementing the consistency condition by means
of lagrange multiplier 2 (which enlarges even further the conguration pace) we get the
twice-iterated lagrangian

l(2) =   + r

r + l

l + 11 + 22  v (2),

assuming now that the new set of symplectic variables is given in the following order

and the non vanishing components of the canonical one-form

a(1)
a = (1, 2, , r, l, 0, 0, 0),

(52)

the corresponding zero-mode is

and the following symmetry of the action

1 = u, 2 = 0,  = 0,  = 0, r = 2ur,
l = 2ul, r = 2iuer, l = 2iul.

this time let us choose the gauge

3   = 0,





(x  y). (54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

and using the consistency condition by means of a new lagrange multiplier 3 we get the
third-iterated lagrangian

l(3) =   + r

r + l

(58)

(59)

(60)

where

or explicitly

v (3) = v (2)|3=0.
r + iel

v (3) = jj  ier

l + me0.

since the symplectic two-form for this lagrangian happens to be a non singular matrix our
algorithm has come to an end.

now it is easy to see that collecting the canonical part and the symplectic potential v (3)

we end up with the following massive thirring model lagrangian

l[, ] = i  me0 

1

gjj + j0.

(61)

we have made the same choice, k = 2/g, as in the previous section, and the eld rescal-
ing   1/k. this is in agreement with our result in (38), where it has been obtained
solving the constraint and diagonalizing the canonical part by darboux transforming the
dirac eld (37). as a bonus, in the symplectic approach we get a term associated to the
chemical potential  ( i 1  ) times the fermion charge density.

10

5.1 the sine-gordon model

as it was anticipated above, one can choose another gauge xing, instead of (48), to construct
the twice-iterated lagrangian. let us make the choice

2  j0 = 0,

(62)

which satises the non-gauge invariance condition as can easily be veried by computing
the bracket {1 , j0} = 0. the twice-iterated lagrangian is obtained by bringing back this
constraint into the canonical part of l(1), then

l + 11 + 22  v (2),

since the function xv is arbitrary we end up with the following lagrangian constraint

3  j1 = 0.

notice that by solving the constraints 2 = 0 and 3 = 0, we obtain

er = r,

el = l.

(71)

this is precisely the reality conditions for the fermi elds. so, we end up in the theory with
a majorana fermion, the scalar , and the auxiliary elds. with the consistency condition
implemented by introducing a third lagrange multiplier into l(2) we get
l + 11 + 22 + 33  v (3)

it can be checked that this matrix has the unique zero-mode

v(3)(x) = (u,2iu, 0, 0, 0, 0,u, 0, 0),

where the function u is totally arbitrary. the zero-mode condition (7) gives rise to

z dxv(x)t



(x) z dyv (3)  0.

then the action has the following symmetry

1 = u, 2 = 2iu, 3 = 0,  = 0,  = u, r = 0, l = 0
r = 0,

l = 0.

(80)

this symmetry allows us to x irl to be a constant. by taking r = im and
l = , with m a real number, we nd that irl indead becomes a constant. note that
 and  are grassmannian variables, while  is an ordinary commuting number. in order
to obtain a manifestly lorentz invariant nal lagrangian we must choose the conjugated
momenta  =  /4. choosing k = 2/g as the overall coupling constant and rescaling
the eld,   g, we are left with

(81)

this is just the sine-gordon model lagrangian. in addition we get a term multiplied by
a chemical potential  ( 1  ). this is a topological term, in the sense that it only depends
on the value of the  eld at the spatial boundary (x = ). this is just the topological
charge density.

6 summary and conclusions

the conformal invariance of the ane sl2 toda model coupled to matter eld is explicitely
broken by setting  =const. then the reduction is performed by imposing a constraint
which is precisely the equivalence relation between the noether and topological currents.
we incorporate this constraint by adding to the action the term (2ij   ) where 
are lagrange multipliers. we write the lagrangian density as a rst order expression in time
derivatives of the dynamical variables, and observe that 1 appears non linearly while 0
does linearly. the euler-lagrange equations for the s allow one to solve for the 1 in terms
of the other variables, and leave for further analysis the linearly occuring 0 which is related
to a true constraint 1  2ij0  . then following the initial fj method we solved the
constraint for the  eld, which is the easiest way to do it, replaced back into the lagrangian
density and performed darbouxs tranformations, and ended up with a canonical expression
for the dirac elds, which combined to the symplectic potential was precisely the massive
thirring model.
the second main point we should highlight relies upon the use of the constrained symplectic
formalism, which allows to overcome the dicult task of solving the constraint for the dirac
eld in terms of the  eld as required in the initial fj approach. by bringing the constraints,
iteratively into the canonical part of the lagrangian, considering the zero-mode conditions
and after imposing the new constraints and gauge xing we have been able to arrive nally
at the sine-gordon or massive thirring model, depending on the specic gauge xing.
an interesting observation is that the method allowed us to obtain the canonical structure
only in terms of the fermion or the boson degree of freedom, by conveniently choosing the
constraint in the initial coupled lagrangian (27), which is nothing but the noether and
topological current equivalence condition incorporated making use of lagrange multipliers,

13

and the convenient choice of gauge xings eqs. (48) and (57) to obtain the massive thirring
model, and the gauge xing eq. (62) and the lagrangian constraint eq.(70) to get the sine-
gordon model. thus, eq. (27) denes a so called parent lagrangian [13] from which both
of the models are derivable. from the lagrangians (38) and (81), it is also clear the duality
exchange of the coupling regimes: g  1/g. moreover, we believe that this approach claries
the role played by such parent lagrangians. for example in [20], the authors have recently
shown the exact quantum equivalence between the sine-gordon and massive thirring models
by gauge xing a wider gauge invariant theory in two dierent ways.
