abstract

the restricted class of natanzon potentials with two free parameters is studied within the

context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. the hierarchy of hamiltonians is indicated,

where the rst members of the superfamily are explicitly evaluated and a general form for

the superpotential is proposed.

i. introduction

the set of potentials known as natanzon potentials have numerous applications in

several branches of physics, [1]-[11]. an important point to stress is that the two classes of

natanzon potentials, the hypergeometric and the conuent, include all the potentials whose

schroendinger equation is analytically and exactly solvable, [2]. they have motivated several

works concerning the mathematical and algebraic aspects of their structure and solutions,

[2]-[8].

in particular, there are studies within the context supersymmetric quantum mechanics

formalism. cooper et al, [9], for instance, investigated the relationship between shape invari-

ance and exactly analytical solvable potentials and showed that the natanzon potential is

not shape invariant although it has analytical solutions for the associated schroedinger equa-

tion. levai et al, [10], have determined phase-equivalent potentials for a class of natanzon

potentials employing the formalism of supersymmetry.

however, the hierarchy of the hamiltonians corresponding to natanzon potentials has

not been determined yet. cooper et al in ref.

[11] attempted to this possibility but the

hierarchy was not computed, since they were only interested in the rst two members of the

1

hierarchy, the two partner hamiltonians, in order to check the shape invariance. in this work

we explore this point. the superalgebra is used to construct the hierarchy of hamiltonians

of the restricted class of natanzon potentials, with two free parameters. the rst few mem-

bers of the superfamily are explicitly evaluated and a general form for the superportential is

proposed by induction. comments about exactly solvable potentials and their relationship

with supersymmetry are given in the conclusions.

ii. supersymmetric quantum mechanics formalism

in the formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics there are two operators q and q+,

that satisfy the algebra

{q, q} = {q+, q+} = 0,

{q, q+} = hss

(1)

where hss is the supersymmetric hamiltonian. the usual realisation of the operators q and

q+ is

q = a

1  =   0

a
1

0

0 ! , q+ = a+

1 + =   0 a+
0 !

0

1

(2)

where  are written in terms of the pauli matrices and a

1 are bosonic operators written in

terms of the superpotential w1(r):

a

1 =  

d
dr

+ w1(r)! .

with this realisation the supersymmetric hamiltonian hss is given by

hss =   a+

1 a
1
0

1 ! =   h1
0
1 a+
a

0 h2 !

0

(3)

(4)

where h1 and h2 are supersymmetric partner hamiltonians. there is a direct relationship

between these hamiltonians and their spectra of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, namely,

(1)

n+1  a+

1 (2)

n , (2)

1 (1)

n+1

n  a
e(1)

n+1 = e(2)
n

with e(1)

0 = 0, (n = 0, 1, ...).

the superpotential and the ground state eigenfunction are related by

w1(r) = 

log((1)

0 ).

d
dr

2

(5)

(6)

substituting a

1 as dened in (3) into h1 given by (4) we end up with the riccati equation

satised by w1,

w 2

1 

dw1
dr

= v1(r)  (1)
0 .

(7)

this structure can be repeated for h2, i.e., h2 can be factorized again in terms of its

ground state

with

h2 = a+

2 a
2

a

2 =  

d
dr

+ w2(r)!

(8)

(9)

where the superpotential w2 can be written in terms of the ground state eigenfuntion of h2

w2(r) = 

d
dr

log((2)

0 ).

(10)

repeating this process n times, we get a whole family of hamiltonians, related by super-

symmetry, [11], [12]

with

hn = a+

n a
n

a

n =  

d
dr

+ wn(r)! .

(11)

(12)

the supersymmetry enables us to relate all the n members of the hierarchy, as made for

the rst two members, see g.1,

(1)

n  a+

1 a+

e(1)

0

n (n+1)
2 ...a+
n = e(n+1)

0

(13)

where the eigunfunctions must be normalizable.

iii. natanzon potential and the hierarchy of hamiltonians

the restricted class of natanzon potentials having two parameters and given in terms of the

variable y(r) is,

v (r) = {2v(v + 1) +

1
4

(1  2)[5(1  2)y4  (7  2)y2 + 2]}(1  y2) ,

(14)

3

where the variable function y(r) satises

dy/dr = (1  y2)[1  (1  2)y2].

(15)

the dimensionless free parameters v and  measure the depth and the shape of the potential,

respectively.

we write the schroedinger equation for this potential, [2], [3], in dimensionless units

r = bx = (2mv0/h2)1/2x

[d2/dr2 + v (r)]n(r) = nn(r)

(16)

where v (x) = v0v (r), n = en/v0 .

the analytic solutions for the energy eigenfunctions are given by,

n = (1  2)n/2[g(y)](2n+1)/4c n+1/2

n

(y/[g(y)]1/2)

(17)

where g(y) = 1  (1  2)y2. the factor c (a)

n (x) is a gegenbauer polynomial when n is a

non-negative integer, which is our case. the correponding energy eigenvalues are given by

n = 2

n4 , n > 0,

where

n2 = [2(v + 1/2)2 + (1  2)(n + 1/2)2]1/2  (n + 1/2).

(18)

(19)

notice the relationship between the energy levels which will be extensively used in what

follows,

(2

n  2

n1)2 = (2n  (2n + 1)n + (2n  1)n1).

(20)

in order to construct the superfamily we rstly factorize the natanzon potential, calling
v (r) = v1(r) = v(r) + (1)

0 , [9], whose schroedinger equation is

h1  (1)

0 = a+

1 a

1 , a

1 = 

d
dr

+ w1(r)

(21)

where (1)

n = n. the superpotential w1(r) is evaluated from the knowledge of the ground-

state eigenfunction of v (r), w1(r) =  d

dr log((1)

0 ), where (1)

n = n, given by (17).

it

satises the riccati equation and it is given by

w1(r) =

(22)

the superpartner hamiltonian satises the equation

h2  (1)

0 = a

1 a+
1

which is written in terms of v2(r) like

w 2

1 +

dw1
dr

(23)

(24)

where

v2(r) = {2

04 + 02 +

4

(1  2)[7(1  2)y4 + (9  32  802)y2  2]}(1  y2). (25)

to construct the next member of the superfamily, we factorize the schroedinger equation for

v2. it gives

h2  (2)

0 = a+

2 , a

2 = 

d

casting all the results we have so far for the hierarchy, the following nth-term for the

superpotential is induced

wn+1 =

2n + 1

2

(1  2)y(y2  1) + yn2 +

d
dr

where fn(y) is a 2n-order polynomial of the form

n

i=0 fi1

log(qn

fn

)

, f0 = f1 = 1

(42)

we stress that since wn+1 is a superpotential it checks the riccati equation,

fn(y) =

we have therefore a recursive relationship between wn+1 and wn given by

therefore, fn+1 can be determined from the knowledge of fn. in this way, the particular

cases of n = 1, n = 2 and n = 3 can be checked by inspection and the resulting functions

f1, f2 and f3 perfectly agree with equations (29) , (35) and (38) respectively.

iv. conclusions

the hierarchy of hamiltonians is studied for the restricted class of natanzon potentials, with

two parameters and a general form for the superpotential is proposed. the superalgebra

drives us to the conclusion that the whole superfamily is a collection of exactly solvable

hamiltonians.

as a nal remark, some aspects related to shape invariance emerge from the results

presented here. the shape invariance concept introduced by gedenshtein, [13], has motivated

several discussions about the exactly solvable potentials. in ref.

[11] there is an extensive

explanation about this subject.

the natanzon potential is not shape invariant in the gedenshtein sense, [9]. however, for

the restricted class analised here, it was possible to obtain a general form for the superpoten-

tial, as shown in the previous section. thus, we conceived a more general condition, written

in terms of the whole superfamily (not in terms of two members, v1 and v2, as usual), to

indicate if a given potential is exactly solvable or not.

we argue that a criteria of solvability of a potential can be written in terms of the super-

potential. in this way, if it is possible to construct a general expression for all superpotentials

in the hierarchy of hamiltonians then the original potential is exactly solvable.

8

the hulthen potential without the potential barrier term is another example of an exactly

solvable potential which is not shape invariant, but for which it is possible to determine a

general expression for the superpotential in the hierarchy, [14].
