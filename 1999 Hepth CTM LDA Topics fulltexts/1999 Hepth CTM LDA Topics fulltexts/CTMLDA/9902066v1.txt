1. introduction and summary

the purpose of the present note is to present the details of a method
to compute the symmetry superalgebra of certain bosonic supergravity
vacua. this method was applied in [1] on vacua of the form ads  x,
with x a compact einstein manifold admitting killing spinors, to per-
form a general geometrical check of the ads/cft duality conjecture
[12]. a similar method has been applied by gauntlett, myers and
townsend [8, 7, 17] in the context of supergravity vacua corresponding
to rotating and intersecting branes. these two methods are conceptu-
ally identical, but the computational details are substantially dierent
to merit the present note. in particular, our method is applicable to
a large class of examples where the explicit form of the killing spinors
are not known. although most of the results contained in this note
were obtained more than half a year ago, we thought at the time that

1

the method was well-known. only recently have we become aware of
the fact that this might not be the case.

we will be concerned with bosonic vacua of the form adsp+2  xd,
where d = p + 2 + d is either 10 or 11, corresponding to type ii
and eleven-dimensional supergravities, respectively. the vacua we will
consider preserve some supersymmetry provided that x admits real
killing spinors (see below). in turn this implies that x is a compact
einstein manifold whose cone has special holonomy. these geometries
have been classied, and are reviewed in table 3.

to every such spacetime adsx we will associate a lie superalgebra
s, which is to be understood as the superalgebra of symmetries of such
a background. we call it the symmetry superalgebra of the bosonic
background.

as a vector space, any lie superalgebra s breaks up into an even
and an odd subspace s = b  f. in terms of these subspaces, the
conditions for s to be a lie superalgebra become the following:

(s1) b is a lie subalgebra;
(s2) f is a representation of b;
(s3) there is a b-equivariant symmetric bilinear map

{, } : f  f  b

which satises the jacobi identity

{f1, f2}  f3 + {f2, f3}  f1 + {f1, f3}  f2 = 0 ,

where we have denoted the action of b on f by .

(1)

(2)

the main purpose of this note is to detail the construction of the
symmetry superalgebra of each bosonic vacuum of the form ads  x.
the construction will break up into several stages, roughly correspond-
ing to each of the above structures. the construction runs as follows:

 the subspaces b and f are given by the killing vectors and killing

spinors of the spacetime ads  x;

 the killing vectors acts on the killing spinors via the spinorial lie

derivative; and

 the bilinear map f  f  b is the usual squaring of spinors.

it might seem that in order to identify the symmetry superalgebra
of a given geometry, one needs to know the explicit form of the killing
spinors. this is indeed the case in some applications [8, 7, 17], but not
every time. if this were the case it would severely limit the usefulness
of this method, since killing spinors are not known explicitly for all
but the simplest geometries, namely the space forms. fortunately,
for the large class of geometries considered in [1], one can identify
the symmetry superalgebra using group theory, without the need to
construct the killing spinors explicitly. this is made possible by bars
observation [4] (see also [10]) that killing spinors on x are related to

on the supersymmetries of anti de sitter vacua

parallel spinors on the cone over x, which have a well-dened group-
theoretical interpretation in terms of the holonomy group of the cone;
and by nahms classication [14] of anti de sitter superalgebras, which
leaves no room for ambiguity in the examples we will consider.

the results of [1] are summarised in table 1, which may contain
some nonstandard notation. first of all the notation for lie superal-
gebras, although not traditional, is consistent with the fact that for
= sp1 and not sp2. since the spinors in (lorentzian) eleven
us su2
and ten dimensions are real, f is always a real representation of b.
this requires the introduction of some notation concerning real rep-
resentations. let r be a complex representation of some given lie
algebra. there are two ways of making a real representation out of
r. it may be that r has a real structure (i.e., r admits an invariant
symmetric complex-bilinear form). in this case, r is the complexi-
cation of a real representation [r]. in other words, [r] is dened by

r = [r] rc. on the other hand, if r is truly a complex representa-
so that r  r = [r  r] rc. the real representation [r  r]
complex-bilinear forms), then their tensor product r c r inherits a
[r c r]. this explains the rst fermionic representation in the table.

is denoted [[r]]. notice that if r has complex dimension r, then [r]
has real dimension r and [[r]] has real dimension 2r. if r and r ad-
mit quaternionic structures (i.e., they admit invariant antisymmetric

tion, we can consider r  r. this representation has a real structure,

table 1. symmetry superalgebras of adsp+2  xd, with
x simply-connected.

the table is complete for simply-connected spaces x. it is possible
to obtain other symmetry superalgebras by taking nite quotients of
the sphere. the main purpose of the note is to exhibit the computations
leading to this table in some detail.

this note is organised as follows. in section 2 we dene real killing
spinors and introduce the main ingredients in the construction of the

4

jos e miguel figueroa-ofarrill

isometry subalgebra: the spinorial lie derivative and the squaring of
the spinors. in section 3 we will discuss the main computational tool
in our approach: the relation between killing spinors on x and parallel
spinors on the cone over x. in section 4 we discuss the relation between
the isometries of x and the isometries of the cone. finally in section 5
we will apply this to the cases of interest adsp+2  xd for (p, d) 
{(2, 7), (3, 5), (5, 4)}.

2. killing spinors and the symmetry superalgebra

in this section we introduce the basic ingredients in the construction
of the symmetry superalgebra of a bosonic vacuum of the form adsx.
such vacua will preserve supersymmetry provided that x admits real
killing spinors. let us review this notion.

where  r is a constant, and  is the action of the cliord bundle on

let x be an n-dimensional riemannian spin manifold. let  be a

spinor on x. we say that  is a real killing spinor if

w  = w   for all vectors w ,

(3)

the spinor bundle. relative to a local orthonormal frame, this equation
becomes:

i = i   ,

(4)

it should be remarked that the
where i satisfy {i, j} = 2 ij.
real in the denition refers to the fact that  is real: the spinor
itself is complex. the integrability condition for (3) says that x is an
einstein manifold with scalar curvature 4 2n(n  1). such manifolds
are necessarily compact. we choose to normalise the metric in such a
way that  =  1
2 .

of the two possible values of , only one will give rise to symmetries
of the supergravity vacuum; indeed, the sign of  is correlated to the
sign of the ux through xd of the d-form eld in the supergravity theory
under consideration.

the isometry algebra b of adsp+2  xd is isomorphic to the product
b(adsp+2)  b(xd) of the isometry algebras of the anti de sitter space
adsp+2 and of xd. the fermionic subspace f will similarly break up
into a direct sum f(adsp+2)  f(xd) of the spaces of killing spinors on
adsp+2 and on xd. the isometries and killing spinors on anti de sitter
space are well known and will be discussed briey below. on the other
hand, the killing spinors on x can be mapped to parallel spinors on
the cone over x, and can be studied group-theoretically. this will be
discussed in detail below.

2.1. the spinorial lie derivative. the next ingredient in the con-
struction of the symmetry superalgebra is the spinorial lie derivative,
which tells us how the killing vectors b act on the killing spinors f.
since the spinor bundle is not a gln bundle, a lie derivative cannot

on the supersymmetries of anti de sitter vacua

5

be readily dened. however we will see that for certain types of vector
elds, namely the (conformal) killing vectors, we will be able to make
sense of the lie derivative of a spinor.

let v be a vector eld and let  be a spinor. the spinorial lie

derivative lv must obey the following properties:
(l1) it should be a derivative; that is, for any function f ,

lv (f ) = v (f )  + f lv  ;

(l2) it should be independent on the choice of local orthonormal frame;
(l3) it should induce, on bispinors, the usual lie derivative on dier-

ential forms; and

(l4) it should form a representation of (a lie subalgebra of) the algebra

of vector elds:

[lv , lw ]  = l[v,w ]  .

let us see what it takes to satisfy these conditions. the rst condi-

tion (l1) simply says that

lv  = v  + (v )   ,

where  is the spin connection and (v ) takes values in the clif-
ford bundle c(t x), which we identify with the endomorphisms of
the spinor bundle. this expression also satises the second condition
(l2), since both the spin connection  and the sections of the clif-
ford bundle transform covariantly under a change of local orthonormal
frame.

the third condition (l3) is tantamount to imposing that the spinorial

lie derivative be compatible with the action of the cliord bundle:

lv w   = [v, w ]   + w  lv  ,

(5)

which in turn implies the following relation

(v )  w  w  (v ) = w v

for all w ,

which is to be understood as a relation in the cliord bundle. up to
central terms in the cliord algebra, (v ) must take the form

(v ) = 1

4ijij ,

where the coecients ij = ji must satisfy the following condition

ij = ivj .

taking into account that the left-hand side is antisymmetric, the only
solution is ij = [ivj], where (ivj) = 0. in other words, v has to
be a killing vector.

in summary, we dene the lie derivative of a spinor  in the direc-

tion of the killing vector v by

lv   v   1

4(ivj)ij   .

(6)

6

jos e miguel figueroa-ofarrill

this equation is due to kosmann [11], where it is shown that the fourth
condition (l4) is automatically satised.

it should be remarked that if we drop property l3 then the spinorial
lie derivative (6) obeys property l4 provided that v is a conformal
killing vector (see, e.g., [16]).

if v is a killing vector the spinorial lie derivative preserves the spin

connection

lv w  = [v,w ] + w lv  .

(7)

it follows from this fact that the spinorial lie derivative with respect to
a killing vector preserves the space of killing spinors (see, e.g., [13]).
indeed, suppose that  is a killing spinor, and let us take the lie
derivative of equation (3):

lv [w   w  ]

= [v,w ] + w lv   [v, w ]    w  lv  ,

where we have used equation (7). the rst and third terms in the
right-hand side cancel each other out because  is a killing spinor, as
does the left-hand side of the equation. the remaining terms say that
lv  is a killing spinor with the same constant :

w lv  = w  lv  .

although we have been discussing the case of  6= 0, the above
discussion applies equally well to manifolds admitting parallel spinors,
which we can think of as killing spinors with  = 0.

2.2. from killing spinors to killing vectors. the nal ingredient
in the construction of the symmetry superalgebra is the bilinear map
taking killing spinors to killing vectors. let  and  be two real
killing spinors with the same constant . then we can dene a vector
v whose components relative to a local orthonormal frame {ei} are
given by

v i = h, i  i ,

(8)

where h, i is the hermitian inner product in the spinor representa-
tion. we will show that v is a killing vector.

to see this we notice that for the cliord algebra cn given by (18),
we can always choose the inner product h, i such that the cliord
action is unitary:

hi  , i = h, i  i .

(9)

we can now simply compute:

ivj = hi, j  i + h, j  ii
= hi, j  i + h, ji  i
= h, [j, i]  i ,

on the supersymmetries of anti de sitter vacua

7

which is antisymmetric under i  j. thus killings equation is satis-
ed.

it might seem that equation (9) makes the mapping f  f  b
antisymmetric instead of symmetric. this is only because geometric
spinors are commuting. on the other hand, the eld-theoretical spinors
(hence the objects in f) are anticommuting: they can be thought of
as products of the killing spinors with anticommuting elements of an
underlying innitely generated grassmann algebra. in that case, we
the map ff  b is indeed symmetric as expected. moreover because
of property l3 of the spinorial lie derivative, it is b-equivariant.

the nal property that has to be checked is the jacobi identity for
the trilinear map fff  f. if a for a = 1, 2, 3 are killing spinors
with the same constant , then the jacobi identity becomes

lv123 + lv231 + lv312 = 0 ,

(10)

where vab is the killing vector made out of a and b, whose compo-
nents are given by v i
ab = ha, i  bi. applying the denitions, the
jacobi identity (10) becomes

h1, i  2i i  3 + 1

2h1, ij  2i ij  3 + cyclic = 0 ,

(11)

which, if need be, can be checked case by case using fierz rearrange-
ments.

3. killing spinors and parallel spinors

in this and the following section we collect some necessary geometri-
cal facts that will allow us to turn the determination of the symmetry
superalgebra s into a group theory problem, at least for the cases we
will consider. the observation underpinning this approach is due to
bar [4], who noticed that the killing spinor equation (3) normalised to
 =  1
2 can be understood as the condition that  be parallel with
respect to a modied connection  which coincides formally with the
riemannian connection on the metric cone of x. in fact, this can be
made precise and bar proved that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between killing spinors on x and parallel spinors on the cone.

the cone x of x is topologicallyr+  x with metric
where g is the metric on x and r > 0 parametrisesr+. the manifold
natural projection x =r+x  x. we shall not distinguish between

g = dr2 + r2g ,

(12)

x is isometric to the r = 1 slice of x, and we shall not distinguish
between them. for x einstein with scalar curvature n(n  1), (where
n = dim x), the cone metric is ricci-at.

let  = rr be the euler vector on x; it generates an innitesimal
homothety. any vector eld v on x can be lifted to a unique vector
eld on x orthogonal to  and such that it projects to v under the

8

jos e miguel figueroa-ofarrill

a vector and its lift. notice however that if v, w are vector elds on
x, we have that

g(v, w ) = r2 g(v, w ) .

let  denote the riemannian connection on the cone x. then we have
the following:
 =  ,

v w = v w  g(v, w ) ,

v = v

(13)

and

for all vectors v, w tangent to x. in fact, gibbons and rychenkova
[9] have proven that the characterising property of a metric cone is the
existence of a vector eld  such that v = v for all vector elds v .
let {ei} be a local orthonormal frame for x, and { ei} = { ei

(17)

and

need to recall how the cliord bundles on x and on x are related.

1

let c(t x) be the cliord bundle on x, which is a bundle of clif-
ford algebras isomorphic to cn, the euclidean cliord algebra in n-
dimensions. cn is generated by {i} subject to

{i, j} = 2 ij .

(18)
on the other hand, the cliord bundle c(t x) on the cone is locally
modelled on cn+1, which is generated by {i} with i = (i, r  n + 1)
with i running from 1 to n, subject to

{i, j } = 2 ij .

(19)

the algebra cn is naturally a subalgebra of c0
of cn+1. the embedding is given by

n+1, the even subalgebra

i 7 ir ,

(20)

where 2 = 1. notice that under this map 1
induces the natural embedding of the spin groups.

using this we can rewrite equation (17) as

2i   .

(21)

therefore we deduce that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
killing spinors on x and parallel spinors on the cone x: a parallel
spinor  on the cone restricts (at r = 1) to a killing spinor on x, and
conversely, given a killing spinor on x we can extend this to a parallel
spinor on the cone by demanding that it does not depend on r.

in order to understand what kind of killing spinors we get (i.e., the
sign of ) we need to look more closely at the embedding (20). notice
that it has the following additional property:

1    n 7(1    n+1 ,

1    n ,

if n is odd; and
if n is even.

(22)

let n be odd.
in an irreducible representations of cn, the volume
element 1    n is a scalar multiple of the identity. according to the
above equation, it gets mapped to  times the volume element of cn+1.
this means that  is xed in terms of the chirality of the spinor : the
nature of the correspondence will depend on which irreducible repre-
sentation we have chosen to work with in cnequivalently, the orien-
tation of x. on the other hand, if n is even,  is not xed. therefore
for each parallel spinor on x, we get one parallel spinor with  = 1
and one with  = 1 simply by choosing one of the two inequivalent
irreducible representations of cn+1.

since x admits real killing spinors, it is einstein with positive scalar
curvature. by myers theorem (see, e.g., [5]) it is compact, and hence its
fundamental group is nite. we will moreover assume that x is simply
connected. this allows us to use a result of gallots [6] quoted in [4],
which says that the cone over a compact simply-connected manifold
is either at, so that the manifold is the round sphere, or irreducible.
finally, the simply-connected irreducible manifolds admitting parallel
spinors have been classied by wang [18]. the result is summarised in
table 2. the last column indicates the number n of parallel spinors,
which in even dimensions has been rened according to chirality.

table 3. simply-connected manifolds admitting real
killing spinors

we can summarise this section conceptually as follows. let f(x)
2 and let f( x) (or
denote the space of killing spinors on x with  =  1
simply f( x) if dim x is odd) be the space of parallel spinors (of denite
chirality, if applicable) on x. then there are isomorphisms f(x) =
f( x), for dim x even, and f(x) = f( x) for dim x odd. we will
simply summarise this family of isomorphisms as f(x) = f( x).

4. isometries of a conical geometry

in this section we will characterise the isometries of the cone metric
g on x in terms of data on the original space x. we will see that they
come in two avours: either they are lifts of killing vectors on x, or
they are related to conformal killing vectors on x which are given by
gradients of eigenfunctions of the laplacian on x. these latter killing
vectors only exist when x is a spherical form.

let v be a killing vector on x, so it satises killings equation

g( u v , w ) + g(u, w v ) = 0 ,

(23)

for all vector elds u, w in x. let us write v = f r + v , where f is
a function on x and v is a vector eld on x orthogonal to r. it is a
simple matter to compute  v using equation (13):

r v = rf r + r v +

v

1
r

w v = w f r +

1
r

f w + w v  r g(w, v ) r ,

on the supersymmetries of anti de sitter vacua

11

where w is tangent to x. therefore v satises killings equation (23)
if and only if f and v satisfy:

rf = 0 , w f = r2 g( v , w ) and

g(w v , u) + g(w, u v ) = 

2
r

f g(u, w ) ,

for every u, w tangent to x. the rst equation says that f is the lift
of a function on x. the second equation says that

v = v +

1
r

grad f ,

where rv = 0, so that v is the lift of a vector eld on x. the third
(and last) equation becomes:

g(w v, u) + g(w, u v )

+

1
r

[g (w grad f, u) + g (w, u grad f ) + 2f g(u, w )] = 0 .

since the rst two terms are independent of r and so is the term inside
the square brackets, we see that they both have to vanish separately.
this means that v is a killing vector on x and that f is a function
such that its gradient is a conformal killing vector:

g (w grad f, u) + g (w, u grad f ) = 2f g(u, w ) .

tracing this equation, we see that f must in addition satisfy

 f =  div grad f = n f , with n = dim x.

(24)

for x an einstein manifold, this equation is equivalent to the cele-
brated obata equation [15], which only has solutions if x is locally
isometric to a sphere. in other words, if x is simply connected, then
x = sn and there are n + 1 functions obeying (24): the rst non-
constant spherical harmonics, which transform according to the vector
representation of son+1. if x is not simply connected, then x = sn/,
where   son+1 is a nite subgroup. the number of solutions of (24)
will then be equal to the dimension of the space of -invariant solutions
of the equation on the sphere; in other words, the number of linearly
independent singlets in the decomposition of the vector representation
of son+1 under the subgroup .

in summary, the killing vectors of a cone metric ( x, g) are of two

types:

 lifts of killing vectors of (x, g); and
 vectors of the form f r + 1

obeying  f = n f ;

r grad f , where f is a function on x

with the latter only existing in the case of spherical forms. we can
reformulate the former point more precisely as follows.

let b(x) and b( x) denote the lie algebras of killing vectors on x
and x, respectively. then lifting the killing vectors on x to x gives

12

jos e miguel figueroa-ofarrill

rise to a lie algebra homomorphism b(x)  b( x). because lifting
at r = 1 is an isometry, this homomorphism is actually one-to-one. to
prove that the lift is a lie algebra homomorphism we need to go into
a little bit more detail.

on x. as smooth manifolds, ignoring the metric, x =r+  x. let
pr1 : x r+ and pr2 : x  x be the canonical projections. let v

we require a more precise denition of the lift to x of a vector eld

proof :

be a vector eld on x. its lift to x is the unique vector eld v obeying
(pr1) v = 0 and (pr2) v = v . now let w be another vector eld on
x and w its lift to x. then by the functoriality of the derivative map

(pr1)[ v , w ] = [(pr1) v , (pr1) w ] = 0 , and
(pr2)[ v , w ] = [(pr2) v , (pr2) w ] = [v, w ] ,

whence [ v , w ] is the lift of [v, w ].

5. anti de sitter supersymmetries

we have now all the ingredients necessary to determine the symmetry
superalgebra of a bosonic background of the form adsp+2  xd for
(p, d)  {(2, 7), (3, 5), (5, 4)}. we will follow the following strategy:

1. we determine the isometry algebra b of the geometry ads  x;
2. we determine the representation f of b under which the killing

spinors transform; and

3. we inspect nahms classication for candidate lie superalgebras.
the second step makes use of the results about conical geometry de-
veloped in the previous two sections, and turns the problem into a
group-theoretical one.

we saw in the previous two sections that there is a lie algebra ho-
momorphism b(x)  b( x) and a vector space isomorphism f(x) =
f( x). moreover, as we now show, these maps make the following dia-
gram commute, where the horizontal arrows are given by the spinorial
lie derivative (v, ) 7 lv :

b( x)  f( x)  f( x)

x

y

b(x)  f(x)  f(x)

we will actually prove something a little more general. let  be any
spinor on x which restricts to a spinor on x of the same name. let
v be a killing vector on x and let v be the lift to a killing vector on
x. we claim that the spinorial lie derivative l v  is a spinor on x
which restricts to lv  on x.

proof :

let {ei} be an orthonormal frame for x and let { ei } = { ei =
r ei, er = r} be an orthonormal frame for x.

the lift v = v i ei has components: v r = 0 and v i = rv i. let us
compute the spinorial lie derivative l v :
l v  =  v   1

2 vjrj  (cid:1)

suppose then that we want to compute the spinorial lie derivative
lv  of a killing spinor  on x in the direction of a killing vector v .
we proceed as follows:

1. we lift v and  to a killing vector and a parallel spinor, respec-

tively, on the cone x;

2. compute the spinorial lie derivative on x; and
3. we restrict the resulting parallel spinor to a killing spinor on x.

this seemingly circuitous way of computing the spinorial lie derivative
has the advantage that for the spaces in question the spinorial lie
derivative on the cone can be computed using elementary group theory.
indeed, let v be a killing vector on x lifted to x and let  be a parallel
spinor  = 0, then the spinorial lie derivative lv simplies to an
innitesimal orthogonal transformation

lv  = v  + (v )   = (v )   .

(25)

in other words, the isometry algebra acts on the spinors as a subalgebra
of the orthogonal algebra in such a way that it preserves the singlets
under the holonomy subalgebra, i.e., the parallel spinors.

let us now discuss this briey case by case. of the geometries listed
in table 3, the only ones which generically have isometries are the
ones possessing sasakian structures: sasakieinstein and 3-sasaki, so
we will discuss them in turn. we will not need the details of what a
sasaki structure is. the interested reader can consult [2, 3].

5.1. sasakieinstein manifolds. bar [4] exhibited a one-to-one cor-
respondence between sasakieinstein structures on a manifold x and
a calabiyau metrics on the cone x. for our purposes the main fea-
ture of a sasakieinstein space is the existence of a killing vector, s,
constructed as follows. let  be the euler vector on x. since x is
kahler, there is a parallel complex structure j. let s  j. it is clear
that s is orthogonal to  and that it has unit norm. we claim that it
is a killing vector. indeed,

g( v s, w ) = g(j v , w ) = g(j v, w ) = (v, w ) ,

where  is the kahler form. since this is antisymmetric in v, w , it
follows that s is a killing vector. let  be a parallel spinor in x. the

14

lie derivative ls can be computed using equation (25). one gets

4 ijij   .

isj ij   =  1
ls =  1
4
we now use the fact that 1
4ij ij spans a very particular u1 subalgebra
= u1sun, where u1 is
of the maximal un subalgebra of so2n. indeed, un
the lie subalgebra generated by the complex structure and sun  so2n
is the holonomy algebra of the calabiyau. (we take dim x = 2n  1.)
to see how this u1 subalgebra acts on the parallel spinors, we simply
decompose the relevant spinorial representation of so2n under un and
see how the sun singlets transform under the u1.

(26)

although it is possible to give a general answer, we will only consider
the two cases of physical interest [1]: dim x = 5, 7. our results are to
be compared with those of moroianu [13] who uses somewhat dierent
methods to obtain similar results.

consider the case of dim x = 5. because so6

= su4, the spin repre-
sentation is complex and four dimensional. in fact it is the 4 of su4.
the spinors, being real, transform under the real representation [[4]] of
= u1  su3, the real spinor representation [[4]]
4  4. under so6  u3
breaks up as [[4]]  [[3+1]]  [[13]]. therefore the su3 singlets transform
under u1 as a real two-dimensional representation [(+3)  (3)]. in
other word, under u1

= so2, the parallel spinors transform as a 2.

now consider the case dim x = 7, so that the cone is a calabiyau
fourfold. under so8  u1  su4, the spinor representation 8s breaks up
as 8s  (2, 1)  (1, 6), so that the parallel spinors again transform as
the 2 of u1

= so2.

5.2. 3-sasaki manifolds. in [4] bar also exhibited a one-to-one cor-
respondence between 3-sasaki structures on x and hyperkahler metrics
on the cone x. on a hyperkahler x we have a triplet of parallel com-
plex structures i  for  = 1, 2, 3 obeying the algebra of imaginary
quaternions:

i  i  = 1 +  i  .

(27)

let us dene the vector elds s   1
2 i  , with  the euler vector.
as in the sasakieinstein case above, each of the s is a unit-norm
killing vector on x. moreover, because of equation (27), they obey an
so3 lie algebra:

[s, s] = ss  s s

2i  s 

2i  s + 1
2i  s + 1
4i  i    1
2 i  

=  1
=  1
= 1
=  1
=  s .

2 i  s
4i  i

now let  be a parallel spinor in x. using equation (25) we can
compute the lie derivative ls:

ls =  1
4

is

j ij   = 1

8

ijij   ,

(28)

where  is the kahler form associated with the complex structure
i . now we use the fact that the three elements 1
ij ij span an sp1
subalgebra of so4n (where dim x = 4n  1), which is the centraliser
of the holonomy subalgebra spn  so4n.
indeed, sp1  spn  so4n
is a maximal subalgebra. just as in the sasakieinstein case, to see
how this sp1 subalgebra acts on the parallel spinors, it is enough to
decompose the relevant spinorial representation of so4n under sp1  spn
and see how the spn singlets transform under the sp1.

8

again, although it is possible to give a more general answer, we limit
ourselves to the case of interest: n = 2, so that dim x = 7. in this case,
the spinor representation 8s of so8 breaks up under sp1  sp2  so8
as 8s  (3, 1)  (1, 5). thus we see that the three parallel spinors
transform as the 3 of sp1

= so3.

5.3. the symmetry superalgebras. finally we can put it all to-
gether and identify the symmetry superalgebras. we are interested in
geometries of the form ads4  x7, ads5  x5 and ads7  x4. we have
several choices for x, given by table 3, whose generic isometry algebras
b(x) are given by the second factor in the b column of table 1.1 the
rst factor in that column corresponds to the isometry algebra sop+1,2
of adsp+2. for each of the geometries in table 1 we have determined
the representation f of the isometry algebra that the killing spinors are
in. the x part follows from the above considerations, whether the ads
part is well-known and will not be rederived here. finally, equipped
with the lie algebra b and the representation f we look up in nahms
classication [14] of superconformal algebras and we see that in each
case there is a unique superconformal algebra with that data, which is
the superconformal algebra s listed in the table.

as a nal comment, let us remark that whereas the method presented
in this note is quite general, group theory would not be enough to
determine the precise symmetry superalgebra treated in [8, 17]. that
superalgebra has a free parameter  taking values in the unit interval,
which cannot be determined simply from a knowledge of b and f. in
this case one must compute the killing spinors explicitly as was done
in [8, 17], and determine the value of  by looking at the symmetric
bilinear f  f  b.

1we say generic because some of these manifolds will have larger isometry alge-
bras. however it is possible to prove (see, e.g., [13] for some results in this direction)
that the larger isometry algebra is a product of the generic isometry algebra and a
compact lie algebra which acts trivially on the killing spinors. this is nothing but
the geometric manifestation of the colemanmandulahaag lopuszanskysohnius
theorem.
