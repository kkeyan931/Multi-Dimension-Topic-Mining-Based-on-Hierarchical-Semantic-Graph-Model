the bps states of n = 2 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su (2) are constructed
as non-trivial nite-energy solutions of the worldvolume theory of a threebrane probe in f
theory. the solutions preserve 1/2 of n = 2 supersymmetry and provide a worldvolume
realization of strings stretching from the probe to a sevenbrane. the positions of the

sevenbranes correspond to singularities in the eld theory moduli space and to curvature

singularities in the supergravity background. we explicitly show how the uv cut o of the

eective eld theory is mapped into an ir cut o in the supergravity. finally, we discuss

some features of the moduli spaces of these solutions.

1. introduction

super yang-mills theory with gauge group su (n ) and n = 2 supersymmetry is real-
ized at low energy and weak string coupling, on the worldvolume of n dirichlet fourbranes

stretched between two neveu-schwarz vebranes[1]. the singularities where the fourbranes

meet the neveu-schwarz vebranes are resolved in the strong string coupling limit where

this brane set up is replaced by a single m-theory vebrane wrapping the seiberg-witten

curve. in this m-theory description, the fourbranes become tubes, wrapping the eleventh

dimension and stretching between the two at asymptotic sheets of the m-vebrane. the

point at which they meet the vebrane is resolved - the fourbrane (tube) ending on a

vebrane creates a dimple in the vebrane. it is a fascinating result that the non-trivial

bending of the branes due to these dimples encode the perturbative plus all instanton
corrections to the low energy eective action describing the original su (n ) n = 2 super
yang-mills theory1[3]. the encoding of quantum eects in the eld theory in a bending of

the brane geometry is a general feature of gauge theories realized on brane worldvolumes.

the m-theory description of the vebrane is only valid at large string coupling. field

theory however, is only recovered at weak string coupling[4]. quantities that are protected

by supersymmetry are not sensitive to wether they are computed at weak or strong cou-

pling. consequently, computing these quantities we nd the vebrane and eld theory

results agree. the vebrane does not reproduce the eld theory result for quantities that

are not protected by supersymmetry. in particular, higher derivative corrections to the

low energy eective action computed using the vebrane do not agree with the eld theory

results[3].

an alternative approach to the study of n = 2 super yang-mills theory is to realize
these theories as the worldvolume theory of an f theory threebrane[5],[6]. the f theory

background is set up by a collection of n coincindent threebranes, and a number of parallel

f theory sevenbranes. the sevenbranes carry r and ns charge. our notation for the

sevenbranes is dened by saying that a (p, q) string can end on a (p, q) sevenbrane. thus,

for example, a (1,0) string is an elementary type iib string; a (1, 0) sevenbrane is a dirichlet

sevenbrane. in this notation, the f theory background contains one (0, 1) sevenbrane, one

(2, 1) sevenbrane and nf (1, 0) sevenbranes. by taking n large and the string coupling
small, the curvature of the background geometry becomes small almost everwhere and

1 the seiberg-witten eective action can also be recovered from a dirichlet vebrane of iib

string theory wrapping the seiberg-witten curve[2].

1

the supergravity solution can be used to reliably compute quantities in the eld theory

limit as explained in[6]. the eld theory of interest is realized on the worldvolume of

a threebrane probe which explores this geometry[5]. on the supergravity side we are

studying the two body interaction between the probe and the n coincident threebranes.

thus the worldvolume theory of the probe should be compared to the low energy eective

action for the theory with gauge group su (2). higher derivative corrections to the low

energy eective action have been computed in [7],[8]using the probe worldvolume theory.

the probe results reproduce eld theory expectations.

the n = 2 super yang-mills theories have a rich spectrum of bps states[9]. it is
natural to ask what the analog of the eld theory bps states on the threebrane worldvolume

are. sen [10] has identied these states with strings that stretch along geodesics from the

probe to a sevenbrane. this description of bps states provides an elegant description of
the selection rules[11] determining the allowed bps states for the nf  4 su (2) seiberg-
witten theory[12]. an assumption implicit in this approach is that the threebrane probe is

innitely heavy as compared to the string. in this approximation, the three brane remains

at and its geometry is unaected by the string ending on it. recalling the role that

bending plays in the m-theory vebrane description of eld theory, it is natural to identify

this approximation with a classical description of the bps states. in this article, we will

construct a description of bps states of the probe worldvolume, which accounts for the
bending of the threebrane into a dimple due to the string attached to it2. the analogy to

the m-vebrane description of eld theory suggests that we are accounting for quantum

eects in the background of these bps states.

in section 2 we reconsider the problem of solving for the background set up by the

sevenbranes plus n threebranes. this reduces to the problem of solving the laplace

equation on the background generated by the sevenbranes[6]. we show that the solution

to this laplace equation is duality invariant. by making an explicitly duality invariant
ansatz, we are able to accurately construct the background geometry in the large |a| region
and close to the sevenbranes. a computation of the square of the ricci tensor shows that

this background has curvature singularities. the interpretation of these singularities in

the eld theory, are as the points in moduli space where the eective action breaks down

due to the appearance of new massless particles.

2 an analogous computation for the m-theory vebrane has been carried out in[13]. however,
in this case the bps states correspond to self-dual strings stretched along the riemann surface

associated with the seiberg-witten curve, instead of along the moduli space.

2

in section 3 we construct solutions corresponding to dirichlet strings stretching from

the probe to the (0,1) sevenbrane. we do this explicitly for the nf = 0 case, but the exten-
sion to nf  4 is trivial. these magnetic dimple solutions have the interesting property
that they capture the long distance behaviour of the prasad-sommerfeld monopole solu-

tion[14]. the prasad-sommerfeld solution is an exact solution for an su (2) gauge theory.

an important feature of this monopole solution, intimately connected to the non-abelian

structure of the theory, is the way in which both the gauge eld and higgs eld need to

be excited in order to obtain nite energy solutions.

it is interesting that the abelian

worldvolume theory of the probe correctly captures this structure. this is not unexpected

since the probe worldvolume theory is describing the low energy limit of a non-abelian

theory. the energy of these solutions is nite due to a cut o which must be imposed.

the uv cut o in the eld theory maps into an ir cut o in the supergravity, which is a

manifestation of the ir/uv correspondence[15].

in section four we consider the moduli space of the solutions we have constructed.

we are able to compute the metric on the one monopole moduli space exactly. for two

monopoles and higher, it does not seem to be possible to do things exactly. however, under

the assumption that the monopoles are very widely separated, we are able to construct

the asymptotic form of the metric.

in this case, we see that the metric receives both

perturbative and instanton corrections. the hyper-kahler structure of these moduli spaces

in unaected by these corrections.

2. gravitational interpretation of singularities in the field theory moduli

space

the model that we consider comprises of a large number n of coincident threebranes

and a group of separated but parallel sevenbranes. the sevenbranes have worldvolume
coordinates (x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7); the threebranes have worldvolume coordinates
(x0, x1, x2, x3). the presence of the sevenbranes gives rise to nontrivial monodromies for
the complex coupling3  = 1 + i2 as it is moved in the (x8, x9) space transverse to both
the sevenbranes and the threebranes. in order to study n = 2 super yang-mills theory,
one chooses the sevenbrane background in such a way that the complex iib coupling  is

3 the n dependence of  has been discussed in[8]. we will not indicate this dependence

explicitly.

3

equal (up to a factor) to the eective coupling of the low energy limit of the eld theory
of interest[8]. the spacetime coordinates (x8, x9) then play the dual role of coordinates in
the supergravity description, and of the (complex) higgs eld a in the eld theory4. the

metric due to the sevenbranes by themselves is given by[17]

ds2 = (dx0)2 + (dxi)2 + 2(cid:2)(dx8)2 + (dx9)2(cid:3),

where i runs over coordinates parallel to the sevenbrane. the addition of n threebranes

to this pure sevenbrane background deforms the metric and leads to a non-zero self-dual

rr veform ux. this ux and the deformed metric are given in terms of f

the position of the n source threebranes is x0. the index i in (2.2) runs over coordinates

[8], this equation was solved in the large |a| limit, for  corresponding to n = 2 eld

theories with gauge group su (2) and nf = 0, 4 avors of matter.

beyond this approximation, by noting that the form of (2.4) implies that f is invariant

under a duality transformation. to see this, change from the electric variables a to the

dual magnetic variables ad. after a little rewriting, we nd that (2.4) becomes

4 the precise identication between (x8, x9) and a involves a eld redenition as explained in

[16].

if we now identify d =  1
 we see that f is also a solution of the laplace equation written
in terms of the dual variables. this result is a consequence of the fact that the einstein

metric is invariant under the classical sl(2, r) symmetry of iib supergravity. it is possible

to construct an approximate solution f which is valid in the region corresponding to large

in this last formula, a0 is the constant value of a at ad = 0. for concreteness, we will
focus on the pure gauge theory in the discussion which follows, but our results are valid
for all nf  4. in the large a limit, from the work of seiberg and witten[9], we know that
ad can be expressed as a function of a as (see for example [18])

where 0 is the classical coupling and  is the dynamically generated scale at which the
coupling becomes strong. inserting this into (2.6) and evaluating the expression at y = 0

we nd the following asymptotic behaviour for f

f

(aa log |a|)2 .

(2.8)

this reproduces the large |a| solution of [8]. in the small |ad| limit, a can be expressed

thus, in this limit and at y = 0 we nd

(2.9)

(2.10)

it is easy to again check that this is the correct leading behaviour for f close to the monopole
singularity at |ad| = 0. the corrections to f , at y = 0 are of order |ad|4(log|ad|)4.

5

in the large |a| limit, f  0 and in the small |ad| limit, f   signaling potential
singularities in both limits. from the eld theory point of view, both of these limits

correspond to weakly coupled limits of the eld theory (or its dual) which leads us to

suspect that curvature corrections may not be small in these regions[19]. this is easily
conrmed by computing the square of the ricci tensor in string fame, which for large |a|
behaves as rm n rm n  log |a| and for small |ad| behaves as rm n rm n  log |ad|. it is
clear that the point |ad| = 0 corresponds to a curvature singularity in the supergravity
background. if we circle this point in the eld theory moduli space, the coupling transforms

with a nontrivial monodromy, so that this point is to be identied with the position of a

sevenbranes. the appearance of these naked singularities in the supergravity background

could have been anticipated from no-hair theorems[20].

recently a number of interesting type iib supergravity backgrounds were con-

structed[21]. these backgrounds exhibit connement and a running coupling. in addition,

a naked singularity appears in spacetime. it is extremely interesting to determine whether

this naked singularity can be attributed to a weakly coupled dual description of the theory,

since this would provide an example of duality in a non-supersymmetric conning gauge

theory.

3. magnetic dimples in the probe worldvolume

the bps states of the eld theory living on a probe which explores the sevenbrane

background, have been identied with strings that stretch along geodesics, from the probe

to a sevenbrane[10]. in this section we will look for a description of these bps states of

the probe worldvolume, which accounts for the bending of the threebrane into a dimple,

due to the string attached to it. we will focus on the case when a dirichlet string ends on

the probe, corresponding to a magnetic dimple.

the dynamics of the threebrane probe is given by the born-infeld action for a three-

brane in the background geometry of the sevenbranes and n threebranes. this background

has non-zero rr ve-form ux, axion, dilaton and metric. the worldvolume action is com-

puted using the induced (worldspace) metric

gmn = gm n mx m nx n + l2

sfmn

(3.1)

where fmn is the worldvolume eld strength tensor. we will use capital letters to denote
spacetime coordinates (x m ) and lower case letters for worldvolume coordinates (xn). we

6

are using the static gauge (x 0, x 1, x 2, x 3) = (x0, x1, x2, x3). in addition to the born-

infeld term the action includes a wess-zumino-witten coupling to the background rr

ve-form eld strength. the probe is taken parallel to the stack of n threebranes so

that no further supersymmetry is broken when the probe is introduced. the worldvolume

soliton solutions that we will construct have vanishing instanton number density so that

there is no coupling to the axion. the explicit action that we will use is[22]

s = t3z d4xq det(gmn + e 1

2 l2

sfmn) + t3z d4xn1 x n1  ...  n4 x n4an1n2n3n4 ,

(3.2)

where an1n2n3n4 is the potential for the self-dual veform and we have omitted the
fermions. we work in the einstein frame so that the threebrane tension t3 = l4
is
independent of the string coupling. in what follows, we will use ad to denote the magnetic
variable that provides the correct description of the eld theory in the small |ad| regime.
the corresponding low energy eective coupling is denoted d. the electric variable a is
the correct variable to use in the large |a| limit and the associated coupling is denoted  .

s

3.1. spherically symmetric solution

in this section we will construct a worldvolume soliton that can be interpreted as

a single dirichlet string stretching from the probe to the magnetic (0,1) seven brane.
we will study the pure gauge theory. the extension to 0 < nf  4 is straightforward
and amounts the same computation with a dierent  . from the point of view of the

worldvolume, the dirichlet string endpoint behaves as a magnetic monopole[23].
if we
consider the situation in which the probe and the magnetic sevenbrane have the same x9
coordinate and are separated in the x8 direction, then the only higgs eld which is excited
is x8. in addition, because we expect our worldvolume soliton is a magnetic monopole
we make the spherically symmetric ansatz x8 = x8(r) and assume that the only non-

zero component of the worldvolume eld strength tensor in f. with this ansatz, the
threebrane action takes the form

s = t3z dtdrdd(cid:16)pf 1 + 2d(rx8)2qf 1r4 sin2   2dl4

sff

1
f

r2 sin (cid:17). (3.3)

we will consider the situation in which the probe is close to the (0,1) sevenbrane corre-

sponding to a region where ad is small. for this reason we use the dual coupling in (3.3)

7

and we will identify x8 with the dual higgs ad. recall the fact that the born-infeld action
has the property that a bps conguration of its maxwellian truncation satises the equa-

tion of motion of the full born-infeld action[24]. in our case, the maxwellian truncation

of the born-infeld action is just seiberg-witten theory. the supersymmetric variation of

the gaugino of the maxwell theory is

 = (f  + 8rrx8).

(3.4)

a bps background is one for which this variation vanishes. now, note that if we identify
(mn is the at four dimensional minkowski metric)

= (rx8)2 = rr(rx8)2,

(3.5)

we obtain a background invariant under supersymmetries (3.4), where  satises (e e
e88err) = 0. the sign depends on wether we consider a monopole or an anti-monopole
background. this condition can be rewritten as 1238 = . thus, this is a bps
background of seiberg-witten theory. we will assume that (3.5) provides a valid bps

condition for the full born-infeld action. upon making this ansatz, we nd that the deter-

minant factor in the born-infeld action can be written as a perfect square, as expected[25].

the full born-infeld action plus wess-zumino-witten term then simplies to the seiberg-

witten low energy eective action

we have checked that the arguments above can also be made at the level of the equations

s = t3z d4x2d(rx8)2.

(3.6)

of motion. the preserved supersymmetries have a natural interpretation. the probe pre-
serves supersymmetries of the form lql + rqr where 0123l = r. the dirichlet
string preserves supersymmetries for which 08l = r, with the sign depending on
wether the string is parallel or anti-parallel to the x8 axis. the two conditions taken to-
gether imply that 1238i = i, i = l, r. thus, the supersymmetries preserved by
the ansatz (3.5) are exactly the supersymmetries that one would expect to be preserved by
a dirichlet string stretched along the x8 axis. with a suitable choice of the phase of ad we
s = ix8. with this choice, using the formulas for the dual prepotential
can choose 5 adl2
quoted in [18], we nd that the dual coupling can be expressed in terms of x8 as

5 this identication is only correct to leading order at low energy. one needs to perform a
eld redenition of the eld theory higgs elds before they can be identied with supergravity
coordinates[16].

(3.12)

an important feature of the monopole solution, intimately connected to the non-abelian

gauge structure of the theory, is the fact that in order to get a nite energy solution, the

monopole solution excites both the gauge eld and the higgs eld[26]. the higgs eld

component of the prasad-sommerfeld monopole is

where on the second line we have performed a large r expansion. clearly, the electric
variable6 a reproduces the large r behaviour of the higgs eld of the prasad-sommerfeld

solution. thus, we see that the abelian worldvolume theory of the threebrane probe

catches some of the structure of the non-abelian eld theory whose low energy limit it

describes. comparing a to the asymptotic form of the higgs eld in the prasad-sommerfeld

solution allows us to interpret the constants of integration  and . the constant  is
related to the inverse of the electric charge 1/e. as r   a   so that  determines the

expectation value of the dual higgs eld and  is related to the inverse magnetic charge

region of moduli space where |ad| is small, so that the monopoles are lighter that the w 
bosons. we will return to the exponential corrections in (3.13) below.

consider next the small r limit. it is clear that in this limit a  . to correctly
interpret this divergence in a, recall that the seiberg-witten eective action is a wilsonian

eective action, obtained by integrating out all uctuations above the scale set by the

mass of the lightest bps state in the theory. in our case, the lightest bps states are the

monopoles and this scale is mg. the largest uctuations left in the eective low energy
theory all have energies less than mg. by heisenbergs uncertainty relation, the eective
theory must be cut o at a smallest distance of 1/mg. clearly then, the divergence in the
r  0 limit is unphysical and it occurs at length scales below which the eective theory
is valid. what is the interpretation of this short distance (uv) eld theory cut o in the

supergravity description? to answer this question, we will need a better understanding of
the small r behaviour of x8. towards this end, note that with our choice ad,  is pure
imaginary so that

thus, the magnetic dimple is cut o at ad = 0. intuitively this is pleasing: the magnetic

dimple (dirichlet string) should end on the magnetic (0,1) sevenbrane which is indeed

located at ad = 0. to understand the geometry of the dimple close to ad = 0, note that

the induced metric is

(3.17)

in the above expression we have used the approximate solution (2.6) for the metric, ob-

tained in the last section. this is a valid approximation since we are interested in the

geometry close to ad = 0 where our expression for f becomes exact. the proper length to

ad = 0 is clearly innite. it is also clear from (3.17) that the dimple ends at a single point

at ad = 0, which is again satisfying. thus, although we motivated the need to introduce

a cut o from the point of view of the low energy eective action realized on the probe,

one could equally well argue for exactly the same cut o from the dual gravity description.

in the super yang-mills theory one has a short distance (uv) cut o; on the gravity side

one has a long distance (ir) cut o. the connection between these cut os is expected as

a consequence of the uv/ir correspondence.

a direct consequence of the short distance cut o in eld theory, is that the monopole

appears as a sphere of radius 1/mg. from the point of view of the eective eld theory,

it is not possible to localize the monopole any further. the more a particle in quantum

eld theory is localized, the higher the energy of the cloud of virtual particle uctuations

surrounding it will be.

if one localizes the monopole in the eective eld theory any

further, the energy of the uctuations becomes high enough to excite virtual monopole-

antimonopole pairs, and hence we would leave the domain of validity of the eective eld

theory. the origin of the exponential corrections in (3.13) can be traced back to virtual

w  bosons by noting that the factors multiplying r in the exponent are proportional to

the boson mass mw . the higgs eld of the prasad-sommerfeld monopole goes smoothly
to zero as r  0 so that these bosons resolve the singular monopole core. the fact that
these uctuations have been integrated out of the eective theory naturally explains why

a does not receive any exponential corrections. although these corrections are crucial for

the description of the monopole core, they are not needed by the eective eld theory

which describes only low energy (large distance) phenomena.
monopole-antimonopole pairs will resolve the singular behaviour of x8 as r  0.

we now compute the energy of the magnetic dimple. since the dimple is at rest, this

energy should be proportional to the mass of the monopole. as discussed above, 1/ is

playing the role of the electric charge e. the dirac quantization condition is eg = 4, so

that we can identify the magnetic charge g = 4. the magnetic dimple is an excitation

of the at threebrane located at a = . we will denote the corresponding value of the dual
variable ad by a0
d| =
4|a0
d|. to compute the mass of the magnetic dimple note that (we have set the -angle
to zero)

the mass of the dimple lends further support to its interpretation as a magnetic monopole.

3.2. multimonopole solutions

in this section we will describe solutions containing an arbitrary number of separated
static dimples. we will look for static solutions, that have x8 and fij i, j = 1, 2, 3 excited.
it is useful to again consider the maxwellian truncation of the full born-infeld action to

motivate an ansatz. the variation of the gaugino of the maxwellian theory, assuming the

most general static magnetic eld, is given by

 = (ij f ij + kk8kkx8).

thus, a solution which satises

(3.19)

will be invariant under supersymmetries (3.18) as long as  satises 1238 = . the
choice of sign again depends on whether one is describing a monopole or an anti-monopole

background. as explained above, these are exactly the supersymmetries that one would
expect to be preserved by a dirichlet string stretched along the x8 axis. upon making

this ansatz, we again nd that the determinant appearing in the born-infeld action can

be written as a perfect square and that once again the dynamics for the eld theory of

the threebrane probe worldvolume is described by the seiberg-witten low energy eective
action. after noting that the identication adl2
sa/x8, the
equation of motion following from the seiberg-witten eective action can be written as

s = ix8 implies that 2d = l2

this is just the free laplace equation which is easily solved

where  = 1. the number of dimples n and their location (xi, yi, zi) is completely
arbitrary. this is to be expected - bps states do not experience a static force. in the

above, we have set each of the numerators equal to , because as we have seen above

this factor is related to the electric charge e. the classical solution would of course allow

arbitrary coecients. the coecients of these terms can be positive or negative. all

strings must have the same orientation for this to be a bps state. thus the interpretation

of terms with a positive coecient is that they correspond to strings that end on the

threebrane; terms with a negative coecient correspond to strings that start from the

threebrane. the nite energy solutions that we consider only allow for strings that start

from the probe and end on the sevenbrane, and consequently we x the sign of all terms

to be negative. each of the dimples above ends in a point at the sevenbranes at ad = 0.
the electric higgs eld a again reproduces the known asymptotic behaviour of the higgs

eld component of multi-monopole solutions in non-abelian (su (2)) gauge theories[27].

we will now consider the mass of this multi-monopole solution. in the limit that the

dimples are very widely separated, the mass of each dimple can be computed separately.

13

in this widely separated dimple limit, the total energy is simply the sum of the energy

for each dimple, so that the energy of the n-dimple solution is indeed consistent with its

interpretation as an n-monopole state. ofcourse the total energy of the n-dimple state is

independent of the locations of each dimple so that once the energy is known for widely

separated dimples, it is known for all possible positions of the dimples.

4. metric of the monopole moduli space

in the previous section we constructed smooth nite energy solutions to the equations

of motion. the solution describing n bps monopoles is known to be a function of 4n moduli

parameters[28]. the position of each monopole accounts for 3n of these parameters. the

remaining n parameters correspond to phases of the particles. by allowing these moduli to

become time dependent it is possible to construct the low energy equations of motion for the

solitons[29]. the resulting low energy monopole dynamics is given by nding the geodesics
on the monopole moduli space. the low energy dynamics of n = 2 supersymmetric
monopoles has been studied in [30]. in this section we would like to see if the metric on

monopole moduli space can be extracted from the solutions we constructed above.

4.1. one monopole moduli space

a single monopole has four moduli parameters. three of these parameters may be
identied with the center of mass position of the monopole, xi, whilst the fourth moduli

parameter corresponds to the phase of the monopole, . we will denote these moduli as
z = (, x1, x2, x3). after allowing the moduli to pick up a time dependence, the action

picks up the following additional kinetic term

s =z d4x2d ad ad =z dtg z z,

where we have introduced the metric on the one monopole moduli space

g z d3x2d

ad
z

ad
z .

(4.1)

(4.2)

consider rst the center of mass of the monopole. to construct the moduli space depen-
dence on these coordinates, replace xi

0 denotes the initial (time

independent) monopole position. the action picks up the following kinetic terms

0  xi

0 + xi(t), where xi

s =z d4x2d ad ad =z d4x2d

ad
xi(t)

ad
xj(t)

xi(t) xj(t) =z dt xi(t) xj(t)gij.

(4.3)

since the velocity of the monopole is small, we keep only terms which are quadratic in the

monopole velocity. thus, when we compute

gij = z d3x2d

ad
xi

xj = z drddr2 sin 2d(cid:16) ad

we evaluate the integrand at the static monopole solution. using the result

(4.5)

consider now the fourth moduli parameter. under the large gauge transformation g =
e(t)ad one nds that

ai = i((t)ad),

a0 = 0((t)ad),

ad = 0.

(4.6)

note that since the gauge group u (1) is compact, the parameter (t) is a periodic coor-

dinate. it is possible to modify this transformation so that the potential energy remains

constant and a small electric eld is turned on. the modied transformation is[26]

ai = i((t)ad),

a0 = 0((t)ad)  ad,

ad = 0.

(4.7)

after the transformation, the electric eld is ei = f0i = i iad = bi. the fourth
parameter is  and its velocity controls the magnitude of the electric eld which is switched

on. the extra kinetic contribution to the action is

s =

thus, we nd that the quantum mechanics for the collective coordinates on the one

monopole moduli space is described by the action

s =z dt

4|a0

d|zz.

15

(4.9)

this is the correct result[31]. thus, the monopole moduli space is topologically r3  s1.
the induced metric on the moduli space is simply the at metric. it is well known that

this metric is hyper-kahler. this ts nicely with the structure of the moduli space quan-
tum mechanics: the dimple preserves n = 1 supersymmetry in the four dimensional eld
theory. as a result, we would expect an action with n = 4 worldline supersymmetry. in
one dimension there are two types of multiplets with four supercharges. the dimensional
reduction of two dimensional (2, 2) supersymmetry leads to n = 4a supersymmetry. the
presence of this supersymmetry requires that the moduli space be a kahler manifold[32].
the second supersymmetry, n = 4b is obtained by reducing two dimensional (4, 0) su-
persymmetry. the presence of this supersymmetry requires that the moduli space is a

hyper-kahler manifold[32]. the only fermion zero modes in the monopole background in
n = 2 super yang-mills theory is chiral in the sense 1238 =  as explained above.
thus, the supersymmetry on the worldline is n = 4b supersymmetry. the fact that the
moduli space is hyper-kahler is a direct consequence of supersymmetry.

4.2. multi monopole moduli space

the asymptotic metric on the moduli space of two widely separated bps monopoles

has been constructed by manton[29]. in this approach, one considers the dynamics of two
dyons. after constructing the lagrangian that describes the dyons motion in r3, with

constant electric charges as parameters, one identies the electric charges as arising from

the motion on circles associated with the fourth moduli parameter of the monopoles. the

explicit form of the metric for the relative collective coordinates is[29]

ds2 = u (r)dridri +

g2

2m u (r)

(d + idri)2, u (r) = 1 

g2

2m (rjrj)1/2 ,

(4.10)

where ri is the relative coordinate of the two monopoles,  is the relative phase, m the
monopole mass, g the magnetic charge and i the dirac monopole potential which satises
ijkjk = ri/(rjrj)3/2. this is just the taub-nut metric with negative mass. in this

section, we will show that it is possible to reproduce the rst term in this metric from the

dimple solutions. the second term could presumably be reproduced by studying dyonic

dimples.

we will consider the following two-dimple solution

16

a =

xi=1



|~x  ~xi|

.

(4.11)

in the case of the two dimple solution, it is no longer possible to compute the moduli space

metric exactly, and we have to resort to approximate techniques. to reproduce the rst

term in (4.10) we need to evaluate

g = z d3x2d

x = iz d3x

(4.12)

where ,  can take any one of six values corresponding to any of the three spatial coordi-
nates of either monopole. we do not know ad as a function of the x; we will write (4.11)
as a =   . setting ad = a0

d + 1 + o(2) in the expression for a(ad) we nd

a(ad) = a(a0

d) + 1

a

this approximation is excellent at large r where  << 1. thus, we nd that

however, the integrand is of order |~x1  ~x2|2 in this region and in addition the area of the region
to be excluded is /m2

(4.24)

thus, the low energy relative motion is geodesic motion for a metric on r3 given by
ds2 = u (r)dridri, with u (r) = 1 g2/(82|a0
d)r). this reproduces the rst term
in (4.10). notice however that the magnetic coupling comes with a factor of 1/2d(a0
d).
this factor has its origin in the loop plus instanton corrections that were summed to

d|2d(a0

obtain the low energy eective action. these corrections do not change the fact that the

two monopole moduli space is hyper-kahler. thus, the dimple solutions on the probe

reproduces the quantum corrected metric. this non-trivial metric has its origin in the fact

that the forces due to dilaton and photon exchange no longer cancel at non-zero velocity

due to the dierent retardation eects for spin zero and spin one exchange[26].

the exact two monopole metric has been determined by atiyah and hitchin[33]. the

fact that it has an so(3) isometry arising from rotational invariance, that in four dimen-

sions hyper-kahler implies self-dual curvature and the fact that the metric is known to

be complete determines it exactly. expanding the atiyah-hitchin metric and neglecting

exponential corrections, one recovers the taub-nut metric[31]. if we again interpret the
origin of the exponential corrections as having to do with virtual w  boson eects, it is

natural to expect that the exact treatment of the dimples in the probe worldvolume theory

will recover the (quantum corrected) taub-nut metric and not the atiyah-hitchin met-

ric. the metric on the moduli space of n well separated monopoles has been computed by

gibbons and manton[31] by studying the dynamics of n well separated dyons. the exact

monopole metric computed for a tetrahedrally symmetric charge 4 monopole was found

to be exponentially close to the gibbons-manton metric[34]. this result was extended

in [35] where it was shown that the gibbons-manton metric is exponentially close to the

exact metric for the general n monopole solution. in view of these results it is natural

to conjecture that an exact treatment of the n-dimple solution in the probe worldvolume

theory will recover the (quantum corrected) gibbons-manton metric.

note added: when this work was near completion, we received [36].

in this work

nite energy bps states corresponding to open strings that start and end on threebranes
were constructed. these correspond to bps states of the n = 4 super yang-mills theory.
these authors argue for the same cut o employed in our work.
