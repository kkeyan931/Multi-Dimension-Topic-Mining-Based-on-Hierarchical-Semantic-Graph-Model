we present a review of the results on the associativity algebras and wdvv
equations associated with the seiberg-witten solutions of n = 2 susy gauge theo-
ries. it is mostly based on the integrable treatment of these solutions. we consider
various examples of the seiberg-witten solutions and corresponding integrable sys-
tems and discuss when the wdvv equations hold. we also discuss a covariance of
the general wdvv equations.

1 what is wdvv

more than two years ago n.seiberg and e.witten [1] proposed a new way to deal with the
low-energy eective actions of n = 2 four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories, both
pure gauge theories (i.e. containing only vector supermultiplet) and those with matter hyper-
multiplets. among other things, they have shown that the low-energy eective actions (the
end-points of the renormalization group ows) t into universality classes depending on the
vacuum of the theory. if the moduli space of these vacua is a nite-dimensional variety, the
eective actions can be essentially described in terms of a system with nite-dimensional phase
space (# of degrees of freedom is equal to the rank of the gauge group), although the original
theory lives in a many-dimensional space-time. these eective theories turn out to be inte-
grable. integrable structures behind the seiberg-witten (sw) approach has been found in [2]
and later examined in detail for dierent theories in [3]-[13].

the second important property of the sw framework which merits the adjective topo-
logical has been more recently revealed in the series of papers [14]-[19] and has much to do
with the associative algebras. namely, it turns out that the prepotential of sw theory satises
a set of witten-dijkgraaf-verlinde-verlinde (wdvv) equations. these equations have been
originally presented in [20] (in a dierent form, see below)

although generally there is a lot of solutions to the matrix equations (1), it is extremely non-
trivial task to express all the matrix elements through the only function f .
in fact, there
have been only known the two dierent classes of the non-trivial solutions to the wdvv
equations, both being intimately related to the two-dimensional topological theories of type a
(quantum cohomologies [21]) and of type b (n = 2 susy landau-ginzburg (lg) theories that
were investigated in a variety of papers, see, for example, [22] and references therein). thus,
the existence of a new class of solutions connected with the four-dimensional theories looks
quite striking. it is worth noting that both the two-dimensional topological theories and the
sw theories reveal the integrability structures related to the wdvv equations. namely, the
function f plays the role of the (quasiclassical)  -function of some whitham type hierarchy
[22, 2, 23].

in this brief review, we will describe the results of papers [14]-[19] that deal with the structure
and origin of the wdvv equations in the sw theories and, to some extent, with their general
properties1. to give some insight of the general structure of the wdvv equations, let us
consider the simplest non-trivial examples of n = 3 wdvv equations in topological theories.
the rst example is the n = 2 susy lg theory with the superpotential w () = 3  q [22].
in this case, the prepotential reads as

f =

1
2

a1a2

2 +

a2
1a3 +

q

(3)

and the matrices fi (the third derivatives of the prepotential) are

f1 =

0 0 1

0 1 0

1 0 0

,



f2 =

0 1 0

1 0 0

0 0 q

,



f3 =

0 0 q

0 q 0



.

(4)

one can easily check that these matrices do really satisfy the wdvv equations (1).

the second example is the quantum cohomologies of cp2. in this case, the prepotential is

given by the formula [21]

f =

where the coecients nk (describing the rational gromov-witten classes) counts the number
of the rational curves in cp2 and are to be calculated. since the matrices f have the form

f1 =

f2 =

the wdvv equations are equivalent to the identity

which, in turn, results into the recurrent relation dening the coecients nk:

the workshop, in particular, delivered by a.marshakov and a.morozov.

the crucial feature of the presented examples is that, in both cases, there exists a constant
matrix f1. following [22], one can consider it as a at metric on the moduli space. in fact,
in its original version, the wdvv equations have been written in a slightly dierent form,
that is, as the associativity condition of some algebra. we will discuss this later, and now just
remark that, having distinguished (constant) metric   f1, one can naturally rewrite (1) as
the equations

cicj = cjci

(9)

for the matrices ci  1fi, i.e. (ci)j
k = jlfilk. formula (9) is equivalent to (1) with j = 1.
moreover, this particular relation is already sucient [15, 16] to reproduce the whole set of the
wdvv equations (1). indeed, since fi = f1ci, we obtain

fif 1

j fk = f1(cid:16)cic 1

k cj(cid:17)

(10)

which is obviously symmetric under the permutation i  j. let us also note that, although
the wdvv equations can be fullled only for some specic choices of the coordinates ai on the
moduli space, they still admit any linear transformation. this denes the at structures on the
moduli space, and we often call ai at coordinates.

in fact, the existence of the at metric is not necessary for (1) to be true, how we explain
below. moreover, the sw theories give exactly an example of such a case, where there is no
distinguished constant matrix. this matrix can be found in topological theories because of
existence their eld theory interpretation where the unity operator is always presented.

2 perturbative sw prepotentials

before going into the discussion of the wdvv equations for the complete sw prepotentials,
let us note that the leading perturbative part of them should satisfy the equations (1) by itself
(since the classical quadratic piece does not contribute into the third derivatives).
in each
case it can be checked by the straightforward calculation. on the other hand, if the wdvv
equations are fullled for perturbative prepotential, it is a necessary condition for them to hold
for complete prepotential.

the perturbative prepotential can be obtained from the one-loop eld theory calculations.
to this end, let us note that there are two origins of masses in n = 2 susy ym (sym) models:
rst, they can be generated by vacuum values of the scalar  from the gauge supermultiplet. for
a supermultiplet in representation r of the gauge group g this contribution to the prepotential
is given by the analog of the coleman-weinberg formula (from now on, we omit the classical
part of the prepotential from all expressions):

fr = 

1
4

trr 2 log ,

(11)

and the sign is + for vector supermultiplets (normally they are in the adjoint representation)
and  for matter hypermultiplets. second, there are bare masses mr which should be added
to  in (11). as a result, the general expression for the perturbative prepotential is

f =

1

4 xvector

mplets



1

4 xhyper

mplets

tra( + mnia)2 log( + mnia)

(12)

trr( + mrir)2 log( + mrir) + f (m)

3

where the term f (m) depending only on masses is not xed by the (perturbative) eld theory
but can be read o from the non-perturbative description, and ir denotes the unit matrix in
the representation r.

as a concrete example, let us consider the su(n) gauge group. then, say, perturbative

prepotential for the pure gauge theory acquires the form

f pert

v =

1

4xij

(ai  aj)2 log (ai  aj)

(13)

this formula establishes that when v.e.v.s of the scalar elds in the gauge supermultiplet are
non-vanishing (perturbatively ar are eigenvalues of the vacuum expectation matrix hi), the
elds in the gauge multiplet acquire masses mrr = ar  ar (the pair of indices (r, r) label a
eld in the adjoint representation of g). in the su(n) case, the eigenvalues are subject to the

conditionpi ai = 0. analogous formula for the adjoint matter contribution to the prepotential

is

f pert

a = 

(ai  aj + m)2 log (ai  aj + m)

1

4xij

while the contribution of the fundamental matter reads as

f pert

f = 

1

4xi

(ai + m)2 log (ai + m)

(14)

(15)

similar formulas can be obtained for the other groups. the eigenvalues of hi in the rst

fundamental representation of the classical series of the lie groups are

bn (so(2n + 1)) :

{a1, ..., an, 0, a1, ..., an};

cn (sp(n)) :

{a1, ..., an, a1, ..., an};

(16)

dn (so(2n)) :

{a1, ..., an, a1, ..., an}

while the eigenvalues in the adjoint representation have the form

bn :

cn :

{aj; aj  ak};

j < k  n

{2aj; aj  ak};

j < k  n

dn :

{aj  ak},

j < k  n

(17)

analogous formulas can be written for the exceptional groups too. the prepotential in the pure
gauge theory can be read o from the formula (17) and has the form

bn :

f0 =

cn :

f0 =

dn :

the perturbative prepotentials are discussed in detail in [15]. in that paper is also contained
the proof of the wdvv equations for these prepotentials. here we just list some results of [15]
adding some new statements recently obtained.

4

i) the wdvv equations always hold for the pure gauge theories f pert = f pert

(including
the exceptional groups) 2. in fact, in [15] it has been proved that, if one starts with the general
prepotential of the form

v

f =

1

4xi,i (cid:16) (ai  aj)2 log (ai  aj) + + (ai + aj)2 log (ai + aj)(cid:17) +



2xi

a2
i log ai

(19)

the wdvv hold i + =  or + = 0,  being arbitrary. a new result due to a.veselov [25]
shows that this form can be further generalized by adding boundary terms. for this latter case,
however, we do not know the non-perturbative extension.

ii) if one considers the gauge supermultiplets interacting with the nf matter hypermultiplets

in the rst fundamental representation with masses m

f pert = f pert

v + rf pert

f + kff (m)

(20)

(where r and k are some undetermined coecients), the wdvv equations do not hold unless
k = r2/4, the masses are regarded as moduli (i.e. the equations (1) contain the derivatives
with respect to masses) and

ff (m) =

1

4x,(cid:16)(m  m)2 log (m  m)(cid:17)

for the su(n) gauge group and

ff (m) =

1

4x,(cid:16)(m  m)2 log (m  m) + (m + m)2 log (m + m)(cid:17) +

+

r(r + s)

4 x

m2

 log m

(21)

(22)

for other classical groups, s = 2 for the orthogonal groups and s = 2 for the symplectic ones.

note that at value r = 2 the prepotential (20) can be considered as that in the pure gauge
theory with the gauge group of the higher rank rankg + nf . at the same time, at value r = 2,

like ais lying in irrep of g, masses ms can be regarded as lying in irrep of some eg so that
eg = an, dn, cn accordingly (this is nothing but the notorious (gauge

if g = an, cn, dn,
group  avor group) duality, see, e.g. [26]). these correspondences explain the form of
the mass term in the prepotential f (m).

iii) the set of the perturbative prepotentials satisfying the wdvv equations can be further
extended. namely, one can consider higher dimensional susy gauge theories [9, 10, 11, 12],
in particular, 5d theories compactied onto the circle of radius r, so that in four-dimensions
it can be seen as a gauge theory of the innitely many vector supermultiplets with masses
mk = k/r. then, the perturbative prepotentials in the pure gauge su(n) theory of such a
type reads as

f pert =

(23)

where aij  ai  aj and li3(x) is the standard three-logarithm function. the rst sum in
this expression tends to the usual logarithmic prepotential f pert
as r  0, while the second

v

2the rank of the group should be bigger than 2 for the wdvv equations not to be empty, thus for example
in the pure gauge g2-model they are satised trivially. it have been checked in [15, 24] (using maple package)
that the wdvv equations hold for the perturbative prepotentials of the pure gauge f4, e6 and e7 models.
note that the corresponding non-perturbative sw curves are not obviously hyperelliptic.

one vanishes.
it deserves mentioning that the second (cubic) term do not come from any
eld theory calculation, but corresponds to the chern-simons term tr (a  f  f ) in the eld
theory lagrangian [27]. it is similar to the u 3-terms of the perturbative prepotential f pert of the
heterotic string [28]. the presence of these terms turns to be absolutely crucial for the wdvv
equations to hold. further details on this case, and on the prepotential with fundamental
hypermultiplets included can be found in [12].

one can also consider other classical groups. then, the perturbative prepotentials acquire

the form (18) with all x2 log x substituted by i
the line of [15] that these prepotentials satisfy the wdvv equations.

3x3 + 1

iv) if in the 4d theory the adjoint matter hypermultiplets are presented, i.e. f pert =
f pert
v +f pert
a +fa(m), the wdvv equations never hold. at the same time, the wdvv equations
are fullled for the theory with matter hypermultiplets in the symmetric/antisymmetric square
of the fundamental representation3 i the masses of these hypermultiplets are equal to zero.

v) our last example [19, 11] has the most unclear status, at the moment. it corresponds to
the pure gauge 5d theory with higher, n = 2 susy in ve dimensions. starting with such a
ve dimensional model one may obtain four dimensional n = 2 susy models (with elds only
in the adjoint representation of the gauge group) by imposing non-trivial boundary conditions
on half of the elds:

(x5 + r) = e2i(x5).

(25)

if  = 0 one obtains n = 4 susy in four dimensions, but when  6= 2n this is explicitly broken
to n = 2. the low-energy mass spectrum of the four dimensional theory this time contains
two towers of kaluza-klein modes:

m =

n
r

and m =

 + n

, n  z.

the prepotential for the group su(n) (i = 1 . . . n) should be

the prepotential (27) satises the wdvv equations i  =  [19]. moreover, it gives

(24)

where the sum is over the root system  of a lie algebra. the mystery about this prepotential
is that, on one hand, it never satises the wdvv equations unless  =  and we do not know if
the corresponding complete non-perturbative prepotential satises the wdvv even for  = .
on the other hand, in the limit r  0 and   mr for nite m, (when the mass spectrum (26)
reduces to the two points m = 0 and m = m), the theory is the four dimensional ym model
with n = 4 susy softly broken to n = 2, i.e.
includes the adjoint matter hypermultiplet.
it corresponds to item iv) when the wdvv always do not hold. by all these reasons, this
exceptional case deserves further investigation.

from the above consideration of the wdvv equations for the perturbative prepotentials,

one can learn the following lessons:

 masses are to be regarded as moduli

 as an empiric rule, one may say that the wdvv equations are satised by perturbative
prepotentials which depend only on the pairwise sums of the type (ai  bj), where moduli
ai and bj are either periods or masses4. this is the case for the models that contain either
massive matter hypermultiplets in the rst fundamental representation (or its dual), or
massless matter in the square product of those. troubles arise in all other situations
because of the terms with ai  bj  ck  . . .. (the inverse statement is wrong  there are
some exceptions when the wdvv equations hold despite the presence of such terms 
e.g., for the exceptional groups.)

note that, for the non-uv-nite theories with the perturbative prepotential satisfying the
wdvv equations, one can add one more parameter to the set of moduli  the parameter  that
enters all the logarithmic terms as x2 log x/. then, some properly dened wdvv equations
still remain correct despite the matrices f 1
no longer exist (one just needs to consider instead
of them the matrices of the proper minors) [29]  see footnote 9 in sect.6.

i

3 associativity conditions

in the context of the two-dimensional lg topological theories, the wdvv equations arose as
associativity condition of some polynomial algebra. we will prove below that the equations
in the sw theories have the same origin. now we briey remind the main ingredients of this
approach in the standard case of the lg theories.

in this case, one deals with the chiral ring formed by a set of polynomials {i()} and two
co-prime (i.e. without common zeroes) xed polynomials q() and p (). the polynomials 
form the associative algebra with the structure constants c k
ij given with respect to the product
dened by modulo p :

ij = c k

ijkq + ()p   c k

ijkq

the associativity condition being

(ij) k = i (jk) ,

i.e.

cicj = cjci,

(ci)j

k = c j

ik

(30)

(31)

(32)

4this general rule can be easily interpreted in d-brane terms, since the interaction of branes is caused by
strings between them. the pairwise structure (ai  bj) exactly reects this fact, ai and bj should be identied
with the ends of string.

7

now, in order to get from these conditions the wdvv equations, one needs to choose properly
the at moduli [22]:

n

i(n  i)

res(cid:16)p i/ndq(cid:17) , n = ord(p )

ai = 

(33)

then, there exists the prepotential whose third derivatives are given by the residue formula

fijk = res
p =0

ijk

p 

(34)

on the other hand, from the associativity condition (32) and the residue formula (34), one
obtains that

fijk = (ci)l

j fqlk,

i.e. ci = fif 1
q

(35)

substituting this formula for ci into (32), one nally reaches the wdvv equations in the form

fig1fj = fjg1fi,

g  fq

(36)

the choice q = l gives the standard equations (1). in two-dimensional topological theories,
there is always the unity operator that corresponds to q = 1 and leads to the constant metric
fq.

thus, from this short study of the wdvv equations in the lg theories, we can get three

main ingredients necessary for these equations to hold. these are:

 associative algebra

 at moduli (coordinates)

 residue formula

we will show that in the sw theories only the rst ingredient requires a non-trivial check, while
the other two are automatically presented due to proper integrable structures.

4 sw theories and integrable systems

now we turn to the wdvv equations emerging within the context of the sw construction [1]
and show how they are related to integrable system underlying the corresponding sw theory.
the most important result of [1], from this point of view, is that the moduli space of vacua and
low energy eective action in sym theories are completely given by the following input data:

 riemann surface c

 moduli space m (of the curves c)

 meromorphic 1-form ds on c

how it was pointed out in [2, 15, 4], this input can be naturally described in the framework
of some underlying integrable system. let us consider a concrete example  the su(n) pure

8

gauge sym theory that is associated with the periodic toda chain with n sites. this integrable
system is entirely given by the lax operator

l(w) =

(37)

p1

eq1q2



eq1q2

1
w

p2

. . .

...
. . .

. . . pn

w

...



the riemann surface c of the sw data is nothing but the spectral curve of the integrable
system, which is given by the equation

taking into account (37), one can get from this formula the equation

det (l(w)  ) = 0

w +

1
w

= p () =

nyi=1

(  i) , xi

i = 0

(38)

(39)

where the ramication points i are hamiltonians (integrals of motion) parameterizing the
moduli space m of the spectral curves. the replace y  w  1/w transforms the curve (39)
to the standard hyperelliptic form y 2 = p 2  4, the genus of the curve being n  1.

the same integrable system, i.e. the periodic toda chain can be alternatively rewritten in

terms of the 2  2 lax matrices li each associated with the site of the chain:

li =

 + pi eqi
eqi

0 

(40)

the lax operator li can be considered as an innitesimal transfer matrix that shifts from
the i-th to the i + 1-th site of the chain

li()i() = i+1()

(41)

where i() is the two-component baker-akhiezer function.

one also needs to consider proper boundary conditions. in the su(n) case, they are periodic.
the periodic boundary conditions are easily formulated in terms of the baker-akhiezer function
and read as

i+nc() = wi()

(42)

where w is a free parameter (diagonal matrix). the toda chain with these boundary conditions
can be naturally associated with the dynkin diagram of the group a(1)

n1.

one can also introduce the transfer matrix shifting i to i + n

now the periodic boundary conditions are encapsulated in the spectral curve equation

t ()  ln() . . . l1()

or

det(t ()  w  1) = 0

w2  trt ()w + det t () = 0

9

(43)

(44)

(45)

this curve coincides with (39), since det t () = 1 for the toda lax operators (40).

the last important ingredient of the construction is the meromorphic 1-form ds =  dw
w =
 dp
y . from the point of view of the toda chain, it is just the shortened action pdq along the
non-contractible contours on the hamiltonian tori. its dening property is that the derivatives
of ds with respect to the moduli (ramication points) are holomorphic dierentials on the
spectral curve.

after this concrete example, we are ready to describe how the sw data emerge within
a more general integrable framework and then discuss more on the concrete examples of the
sw construction. as before, we start with the theories without matter hypermultiplets. first,
matter hypermultiplets. first, we introduce bare spectral curve e that is torus y2 = x3 +g2x2 +
g3 for the uv nite sym theories with the associated holomorphic 1-form d = dx/y. this bare
spectral curve degenerates into the double-punctured sphere (annulus) for the asymptotically
free theories: x  w + 1/w, y  w  1/w, d = dw/w. on this bare curve, there are
given either a matrix-valued lax operator l(x, y) if one considers an extension of the (37)
lax representation, or another matrix lax operator li(x, y) associated with an extension of
the representation (40) and dening the transfer matrix t (x, y). the corresponding dressed
spectral curve is dened either from the formula det(l  ) = 0, or from det(t  w) = 0.

this spectral curve is a ramied covering of e given by the equation

p(; x, y) = 0

(46)

in the case of the gauge group g = su(n), the function p is a polynomial of degree n in .

thus, the moduli space m of the spectral curve is given just by coecients of p. the
generating 1-form ds = d is meromorphic on c (= denotes the equality modulo total
derivatives).

the prepotential and other physical quantities are dened in terms of the cohomology

class of ds:

ai =iai

ds,

ad
i 

f
ai

=ibi

ds,

(47)

the rst identity denes here the appropriate at moduli, while the second one  the prepoten-
tial. the dening property of the generating dierential ds is that its derivatives w.r.t. moduli
give holomorphic 1-dierentials. in particular,

ai  bj = ij .

ds
ai

= di

(48)

and, therefore, the second derivative of the prepotential w.r.t. ais is the period matrix of the
curve c:

2f
aiaj

= tij

(49)

the latter formula allows one to identify prepotential with logarithm of the  -function of the
whitham hierarchy [22, 23]: f = log  .

so far we reckoned without matter hypermultiplets. in order to include them, one just needs
to consider the surface c with punctures. then, the masses are proportional to residues of ds

at the punctures, and the moduli space has to be extended to include these mass moduli. all
other formulas remain in essence the same (see [15] for more details).

by the present moment, the correspondence between sym theories and integrable systems
is built through the sw construction in most of known cases that are collected in the table5.

this table reects several possible generalizations of the periodic toda chain. first of all, one
can extent the representation in terms of the large lax matrices (37).
it naturally leads
to the system whose potential is doubly-periodic function of coordinates. this system is the
calogero-moser system. it is associated with the elliptic bare spectral curve and generating
1-form ds = d,  being the coordinate on the bare torus. on physical side, this system
corresponds to including the adjoint matter hypermultiplets [8].

the second possible extension is generalization of the 2  2 lax representation of the toda
chain (40). this leads to the xxx spin chain with the cylindrical bare spectral curve and the
same generating 1-form ds = dw/w. physically, this system describes fundamental matter
hypermultiplets included [4, 5].

now, each of these two systems can be further generalized to higher dimensional, 5d and
6d sym gauge theories [10]-[12], with the target space (the fth and sixth dimensions) being
accordingly a cylinder and a torus. within the integrable framework, this means putting
momenta of the system onto the cylinder (hamiltonians periodic in momenta) and the torus
(hamiltonians doubly-periodic in momenta) respectively. in the generating 1-form one needs
just to substitute respectively   log  in 5d and    in 6d,  being the coordinate on
the target space torus. at the same time, the bare spectral curve associated with coordinate
dependence is not changed with this extension.

in a word, adding adjoint matter makes the coordinate dependence (and the bare spectral
curve) elliptic, while coming to higher dimensions provides trigonometric and elliptic momen-
tum dependencies (and the corresponding target space).

5in the table we considered only the classical groups.

11

let us discuss a little the dressed spectral curves. in the adjoint matter case, the spectral
curve is non-hyperelliptic, since the bare curve is elliptic. therefore, it can be described as
some covering of the hyperelliptic curve. we do not go into further details here, just referring
to [15, 11], since the wdvv equations do not hold, at least, in the standard form (1), with the
elliptic bare curve (see below).

instead, we describe the dressed spectral curves for the 4d theories without adjoint matter
with the classical gauge groups in more explicit terms. let us note that in all these cases
the curves are hyperelliptic, since all of them follow from some 2  2 lax representation and,
therefore, are the spectral curves of the form (45).

more concretely, for the sym gauge theory with the gauge group g, one should consider
the integrable system given by this 2  2 lax representation on the dynkin diagram for the
corresponding dual ane algebra g [7].

the spectral curves can be described by the general formula

p(, w) = 2p ()  w 

q()

w

here p () is the characteristic polynomial of the algebra g itself for all g 6= cn, i.e.

p () = det(g  i) =yi

(  i)

(50)

(51)

where determinant is taken in the rst fundamental representation and is are the eigenvalues
of the algebraic element g. for the pure gauge theories with the classical groups [3], q() = 2s

for exceptional groups, the curves arising from the characteristic polynomials of the dual ane
algebras do not acquire the hyperelliptic form although the wdvv equations seem to be still
fullled.

in order to include nf massive hypermultiplets in the rst fundamental representation one
=1(2  m2
 )

=1(  m) if g = an and for q() = 2sqnf

can just change 2s for q() = 2sqnf

if g = bn, cn, dn [26, 30, 7].

note that the 5d theories can be also described by the same curves but by dierent 1-forms

ds [12].

5 wdvv equations in sw theories

as we already discussed, in order to derive the wdvv equations along the line used in the
context of the lg theories, we need three crucial ingredients: at moduli, residue formula and

7in the symplectic case, the curve can be easily recast in the form with polynomial p () and s = 0.

associative algebra. however, the rst two of these are always contained in the sw construction
provided the underlying integrable system is known.
indeed, one can derive (see [15]) the
following residue formula

didjdk

dd

fijk = res
d=0

(53)

where the proper at moduli ais are given by formula (47). thus, the only point to be checked
is the existence of the associative algebra. the residue formula (53) hints that this algebra is
to be the algebra 1 of the holomorphic dierentials di. in the forthcoming discussion we
restrict ourselves to the case of pure gauge theory, the general case being treated in complete
analogy.

let us consider the algebra 1 and x three dierentials dq, d, d  1. the product in

this algebra is given by the expansion

didj = c k

ijdkdq + ()d + ()d

(54)

that should be factorized over the ideal spanned by the dierentials d and d. this product
belongs to the space of quadratic holomorphic dierentials:

1  1  2 = 1  (dq  d  d)

(55)

since the dimension of the space of quadratic holomorphic dierentials is equal to 3g  3, the
l.h.s. of (54) with arbitrary dis is the vector space of dimension 3g  3. at the same time,
at the r.h.s. of (54) there are g arbitrary coecients c k
ij in the rst term (since there are
exactly so many holomorphic 1-dierentials that span the arbitrary holomorphic 1-dierential
c k
ijdk), g  1 arbitrary holomorphic dierentials in the second term (one dierential should
be subtracted to avoid the double counting) and g  2 holomorphic 1-dierentials in the third
one. thus, totally we get that the r.h.s. of (54) is spanned also by the basis of dimension
g + (g  1) + (g  2) = 3g  3.

this means that the algebra exists in the general case of the sw construction. however,
generally this algebra is not associative. this is because, unlike the lg case, when it was the
algebra of polynomials and, therefore, the product of the two belonged to the same space (of
polynomials), product in the algebra of holomorphic 1-dierentials no longer belongs to the same
space but to the space of quadratic holomorphic dierentials. indeed, to check associativity,
one needs to consider the triple product of 1:

1  1  1  3 = 1  (dq)2  2 d  2 d

(56)

now let us repeat our calculation: the dimension of the l.h.s. of this expression is 5g  5 that
is the dimension of the space of holomorphic 3-dierentials. the dimension of the rst space
in expansion of the r.h.s.
is g, the second one is 3g  4 and the third one is 2g  4. since
g + (3g  4) + (2g  4) = 6g  8 is greater than 5g  5 (unless g  3), formula (56) does not
dene the unique expansion of the triple product of 1 and, therefore, the associativity spoils.

the situation can be improved if one considers the curves with additional involutions. as
an example, let us consider the family of hyperelliptic curves: y2 = p ol2g+2(). in this case,
there is the involution,  : y  y and 1 is spanned by the -odd holomorphic 1-dierentials
xi1dx
, i = 1, ..., g. let us also note that both dq and d are -odd, while d is -even. this
means that d can be only meromorphic on the surface without punctures (which is, indeed, the
case in the absence of mass hypermultiplets). thus, d omits from formula (54) that acquires
the form

y

+ = 1

  dq  1

(57)

where we expanded the space of holomorphic 2-dierentials into the parts with denite -parity:
2 = 2
, i = 1, ..., 2g  1 and
xi1(dx)2

+  2
, i = 1, ..., g  2 respectively. now it is easy to understand that the dimensions of the

, which are manifestly given by the dierentials xi1(dx)2

y2

y

l.h.s. and r.h.s. of (57) coincide and are equal to 2g  1.

analogously, in this case, one can check the associativity. it is given by the expansion

3

 = 1

  (dq)2  2

+  d

(58)

where both the l.h.s. and r.h.s. have the same dimension: 3g  2 = g + (2g  2). thus, the
algebra of holomorphic 1-dierentials on hyperelliptic curve is really associative. this completes
the proof of the wdvv equations in this case.

now let us briey look at cases when there exist the associative algebras basing on the
spectral curves discussed in the previous section. first of all, it exists in the theories with the
gauge group an, both in the pure gauge 4d and 5d theories and in the theories with fundamental
matter, since, in accordance with the previous section, the corresponding spectral curves are
hyperelliptic ones of genus n.

the theories with the gauge groups so(n) or sp(n) are also described by the hyperelliptic
curves. the curves, however, are of higher genus 2n  1. this would naively destroy all
the reasoning of this section. the arguments, however, can be restored by noting that the
corresponding curves (see (52)) have yet another involution,  :   . this allows one
to expand further the space of holomorphic dierentials into the pieces with denite -parity:
1
.
one can easily check that it leads again to the associative algebra.

+ etc. so that the proper algebra is generated by the dierentials from 1

  1

 = 1

consideration is even more tricky for the exceptional groups, when the corresponding curves
are looking non-hyperelliptic. however, additional symmetries should allow one to get associa-
tive algebras in these cases too.

there are more cases when the associative algebra exists. first of all, these are 5d theories,
with and without fundamental matter [15]. one can also consider the sym theories with gauge
groups being the product of several factors, with matter in the bi-fundamental representation
[31]. these theories are described by sl(p) spin chains [5] and the existence of the associative
algebra in this case has been checked in [32].

the situation is completely dierent in the adjoint matter case. in four dimensions, the
theory is described by the calogero-moser integrable system. since, in this case, the curve
is non-hyperelliptic and has no enough symmetries, one needs to include into consideration
both the dierentials d and d for algebra to exist. however, under these circumstances, the
algebra is no longer to be associative how it was demonstrated above. this can be done also
by direct calculation for several rst values of n (see [15]). this also explains the lack of the
perturbative wdvv equations in this case (see sect.2).

6 covariance of the wdvv equations

after we have discussed the role of the (generalized) wdvv equations in sym gauge theo-
ries of the seiberg-witten type, let us briey describe the general structure of the equations
themselves. we look at them now just as at some over-dened set of non-linear equations for a

14

function (prepotential) of r variables8 (times), f (ti), i = 1, . . . , r, which can be written in the
form (36)

fig1fj = fjg1fi,

kfk,

i, j = 1, . . . , r and k(t)

g =

rxk=1

(59)

fi being r  r matrices (fi)jk = f,ijk =
linear combination of fks, with coecients k(t) that can be time-dependent.9

titjtk and the metric matrix g is an arbitrary

3f

the wdvv equations imply consistency of the following system of dierential equations

[17]:

 f,ijk


tl  f,ijl



tk! j(t) = 0,

i, j, k

contracting with the vector l(t), one can also rewrite it as

i
tk = c i

jkdj,

i, j

where

ck = g1fk, g = lfl, d = ll

(60)

(61)

(62)

(note that the matrices ck and the dierential d depend on choice of {l(t)}, i.e. on choice of
the metric g) and (59) can be rewritten as

[ci, cj] = 0,

i, j

(63)

as we already discussed, the set of the wdvv equations (59) is invariant under linear change
of the time variables with the prepotential unchanged [15]. according to the second paper of

8we deliberately choose dierent notations for these variables, t instead of a in the gauge theories, in order

to point out more general status of the discussion.

9we already discussed in sect.2 that one can add to the set of times (moduli) in the wdvv equations the
parameter  [29]. in this case, the prepotential that depends on one extra variable t0   can be naturally
considered as a homogeneous function of degree 2:

f (t0, t1, . . . , tr) = (t0)2f (ti/t0),

see [23] for the general theory. as explained in [29], the wdvv equations (59) for f (ti) can be also rewritten
in terms of f (ti ):

fi g1fj = fj g1fi ,

i, j = 0, 1, . . . , r; {k(t)}

where this time fi are (r + 1)  (r + 1) matrices of the third derivatives of f and

g =

rxk=0

kfk,

g1 = (det g)g1

note that the homogeneity of f implies that t0-derivatives are expressed through those w.r.t. ti, e.g.

t0f,0ij = f,ijktk,

t0f,00i = f,ikltktl,

t0f,000 = f,klmtktltm etc.

thus, all the metrics g are degenerate, but g1 are non-degenerate. one can easily reformulate the entire
present section in terms of f .then, e.g., the baker-akhiezer vector-function (t) should be just substituted by
the manifestly homogeneous (of degree 0) function (ti/t0). the extra variable t0 should not be mixed with the
distinguished zero-time associated with the constant metric in the 2d topological theories which generically
does not exist (when it does, see comment 2.3 below, we identify it with tr).

15

[22] and especially to [33], there can exist also non-linear transformations which preserve the
wdvv structure, but they generically change the prepotential. in [18], it is shown that such
transformations are naturally induced by solutions of the linear system (60):

ti  ti = i(t),
f (t)  f (t),

so that the period matrix remains intact:

f,ij =

2f
titj =

2 f
titj

 f,ij

(64)

(65)

now let us make some comments.

1. as explained in [17], the linear system (60) has innitely many solutions. the original
time-variables are among them: i(t) = ti.

2. condition (65) guarantees that the transformation (64) changes the linear system (60) only
by a (matrix) multiplicative factor, i.e. the set of solutions {i(t)} is invariant of (64). among
other things this implies that successively applying (64) one does not produce new sets of
time-variables.

3. we already discussed that, in the case of 2d topological models [21, 22, 33], there is a
distinguished time-variable, say, tr, such that all f,ijk are independent of tr:


tr fijk = 0 i, j, k = 1, . . . , r

(66)

(equivalently,
respect to tr and substitute it by the system


ti frjk = 0 i, j, k). then, one can make the fourier transform of (60) with


tj

i
z = zc i
jk

k
z ,

i, j

(67)

where k
(64) can be substituted by a family, labeled by a single variable z:

z (t1, . . . , tr1, tr)eztr dtr.

z (t1, . . . , tr1) = r k

in this case, the set of transformations

ti  ti

z = i

z(t)

(68)

in the limit z  0 and for the particular choice of the metric, g = fr, one obtains the particular
transformation

ti
tj = c i

jkhk,

hk = const,

(69)

discovered in [33]. (since ci = j c, one can also write ci = c i
4. parameterization like (69) can be used in the generic situation (64) as well (i.e. without
distinguished tr-variable and for the whole family (64)), the only change is that hk is no longer
a constant, but a solution to

k = (f 1

khk, c i

)il f,lk.)

r

(j  dcj)i

k hk = 0

(70)

(hk = dk is always a solution, provided k satises (61)).

note also that, although we have described a set of non-trivial non-linear transformations
which preserve the structure of the wdvv equations (59), the consideration above does not
prove that all such transformations are of the form (64), (65). still, (64) is already unexpectedly
large, because (59) is an over-dened system and it could seem to be very restrictive, if to have
any solutions at all.

16

7 concluding remarks

to conclude this short review, let us emphasize that a lot of problems have to be solved before
we get any real understanding of what the wdvv structure means. we already mentioned the
problem of lack of the wdvv equations for the calogero-moser system. the way to resolve this
problem might be to construct higher associativity conditions like it has been done by e.getzler
in the elliptic case [34], that is to say, for the elliptic gromov-witten classes. the other kind
of problem is that the wdvv equations in the type a topological theories themselves do still
wait for the explanation in terms of associative algebras.

all these problems are to be resolved in order to establish to what extent there is a really
deep reason for the wdvv equations to emerge in topological and seiberg-witten theories.
note that the latter two are connected through the whitham hierarchies (see, e.g., [35], the
second paper in [23] and the review by a.morozov at the workshop) and there are also tight
connections of the whitham hierarchies with the wdvv equations [22].

the other problem is more on the structure of the wdvv equations themselves: up to
now, we do not understand what is the class of solutions to the equations and how wide it is,
having some particular examples in hands. and maybe even more obscure are the origins and
implications of the covariance of the wdvv equations.

at last, we still have no any clear understanding of connections between the wdvv and

integrable structures. what we know is rather a set of random observations.

all these problems appeal for better understanding before we could put the associative

algebras and wdvv equations on any solid footing.
