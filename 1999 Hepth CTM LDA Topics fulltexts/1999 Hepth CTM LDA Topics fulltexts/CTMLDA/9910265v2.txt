abstract

integral representation for the eigenfunctions of quantum periodic toda chain is constructed
for n -particle case. the multiple integral is calculated using the cauchy residue formula.
this gives the representation which reproduces the particular results obtained by gutzwiller
for n = 2, 3 and 4 -particle chain. our method to solve the problem combines the ideas
of gutzwiller and r -matrix approach of sklyanin with the classical results in the theory
of the whittaker functions. in particular, we calculate sklyanins invariant scalar product
from the plancherel formula for the whittaker functions derived by semenov-tian-shansky
thus obtaining the natural interpretation of the sklyanin measure in terms of the harish-
chandra function.

this paper is devoted to construction of the integral representation for the eigenfunctions of
the hamiltonians for the quantum periodic toda chain. our work was initiated by the recent
results of smirnov [1] concerning the structure of matrix elements in periodic toda chain. the
key point of this approach is sklyanins invariant scalar product [2] and we tried to interpret
it as a part of the plancherel formula which relates the scalar product of the eigenfunctions
in original coordinate representation with those arising in the space of the separated variables.
such interpretation forces to combine the analytic method of gutzwiller [3] with the algebraic
approach of sklyanin [2].

to be more precise, gutzwiller [3] discovered an interesting phenomenon which understood
nowadays as quite universal one. if one tries to nd the eigenfunctions of the periodic toda
chain in terms of a formal series in (auxiliary) eigenfunctions of the open chain with unknown
coecients labelled by multiple index, then the multi-dimensional dierence equation on the
coecients thus obtained can be factorized to the one-dimensional baxter equations. this
is what is called the quantum separation of variables.
in this way gutzwiller obtained the
solution to the eigenvalue problem for the n = 2, 3 and 4-particle cases only due to the lack
of appropriate explicit solution for an arbitrary open toda chain. the next important step was
done by sklyanin [2]. he applied the r-matrix formalism to the present problem and simplied
drastically the derivation of the baxter equation to an arbitrary number of particles. the evident
advantages of sklyanins method are a wide area of application and eective way to investigate
dierent structures, for example, the invariant scalar products. but, unfortunately, his purely
algebraic method had no deal with the analytical properties of auxiliary eigenfunctions of the
specic model and, therefore, some important information is inevitably lost to compare with the
original gutzwillers approach. for example, as a price for eciency the measure is dened up
to an arbitrary ih -periodic function in general and there is no natural way to x this freedom
uniquely; there is a fundamental question what is the underlying principle to determine the
asymptotics and analytical properties of the solution to baxter equation and so on. moreover,
the transition from initial coordinate-dependent wave function to those in separated variables

1

is somewhat obscured. the advantage of gutzwiller approach consists of explicit information
concerning the analytical properties of auxiliary eigenfunctions. as a consequence, it gives the
possibility to calculate many ne tuning quantities, for example the numerical coecient in
baxter equation, the asymptotics of its solutions etc. therefore, there is a natural problem to
generalize the gutzwiller results to an arbitrary n -particle toda chain and to extend them to
other models. in particular, the investigation of algebraic origin of the auxiliary functions arising
in other integrable models, is of higher importance.

we consider the periodic toda chain as a test example to future generalization in these directions.
this is the main motivation of the present paper.

we start from well-known observation that the whittaker functions [4]-[6] give the solution of
the eigenvalue problem for the general open toda chain [7, 8]. so it is naturally to use them
to construct the wave functions for the periodic toda chain in the spirit of gutzwiller. as
the main result we obtain the integral representation for the eigenfunctions of periodic toda
chain using intensively the analytical properties of whittaker functions investigated in [4]-[6].
the second important counterpart of this representation is the explicit solution of the baxter
equation constructed by pasquier and gaudin [9]. we calculate the multiple integral by taking
the residues thus obtaining another representation for the wave function which reproduces the
particular results of gutzwiller by putting n = 2, 3 and n = 4 in our general formula. we
observe also that the plancherel formula obtained by semenov-tian-shansky [8] for the wavelets
of whittaker functions produce the natural way to calculate sklyanins scalar product. it turns
out that the sklyanin measure is deeply connected with the harish-chandra function arising in
the theory of whittaker functions.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we briey describe n -particle quantum periodic toda chain in the framework of
r -matrix approach and formulate the spectral problem to be solved. the material here is quite
standard.

the solution of this problem is described by two theorems stated in section 3. this are the main
results of the paper.

the next four sections are devoted to the building blocks which allows to prove the above
theorems.
the solution for the open n 1 -particle toda chain in terms of whittaker functions [7, 8] is
discussed in section 4. we introduce weyl invariant whittaker functions by simple renormal-
ization of the original ones and describe their properties using the classical results [4]-[6]. we
calculate also the scalar product of such functions using the plancherel formula derived in [8].

in section 5 we follow the gutzwiller approach [3] to construct the auxiliary functions which
play the same role for the periodic toda chain as the exponentials for the standard fourier
transform. we generalize the gutzwiller solutions to an arbitrary (n 1) -particle solution in
terms of weyl invariant whittaker functions and calculate the action of the diagonal operators of
the monodromy matrix on the auxiliary functions thus obtaining the functional relations which
generalize the corresponding relations for the macdonald function.

in section 6 we reformulate the spectral problem using the (generalized) fourier transform to the
so-called  -representation which is an analytic version of the algebraic approach by sklyanin [2].
the analytical properties of the auxiliary function play a crucial role here. we show that the wave
function in  -representation is an entire function with denite asymptotics and it satises to

2

multi-dimensional baxter equation. we derive the plancherel formula thus rigorously obtaining
the scalar product in  -variables introduced in [2]. as by-product, we obtain the connection of
the harish-chandra function [4]-[6] with the sklyanin measure.

the solution to the baxter equation is outlined in section 7. we essentially use the approach
by gutzwiller [3] and especially those by pasquier and gaudin [9].

in section 8 the proofs of the theorems stated in section 3 are presented.

2 periodic toda chain (description of the model)

the quantum n -periodic toda chain is a multi-dimensional eigenvalue problem with n mu-
tually commuting hamiltonians hk(x0, p0; . . . ; xn1, pn1) , (k = 1, . . . , n) where the simplest
hamiltonians have the form

pk

h1 =

n 1xk=0
n 1xk=0
h2 = xk<m
pkpm 
h3 = xk<m<n

pkpmpn + ...

exkxk+1

(2.1)

etc. and the phase variables xk, pk satisfy to commutation relations [xk, pm] = ihkm . this
system can be nicely described using the r -matrix approach [2]. it is well known that the lax
operator

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.7)

ln() =

satises the commutation relations

r(  )(ln())  i)(i  ln()) = (i  ln())(ln()  i)r(  )

where

r() = i  i +

ih


p

is a rational r -matrix. the monodromy matrix

tn () def= ln 1() . . . l0()  

a() b()

c() d() 

satises the analogous equation

r(  )(t ()  i)(i  t ()) = (i  t ())(t ()  i)r(  )

from (2.6) it can be easily shown that the trace of the monodromy matrix

bt() = a() + d()

3

satises to commutation relations [bt(),bt()] = 0 and is a generating function for the hamilto-

nians of the periodic toda chain:

let us consider the spectral problem

bt() =

nxk=0
(1)kn khk

hke = eke

k = 1, . . . , n

where e  (e1, . . . , en) . in other words, e is an eigenfunction of the operator bt() :

nxk=0

t(; e) =

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.13)

for the future convenience we shall denote the coordinate dependence of the solutions as
e (x0, x) thus selecting x0 from all other coordinates x = (x1, . . . , xn1) . the reason for
doing this will be clear below. evidently, the wave function has the following structure:

e(x0, x) = ee(x0x1, . . . , xn2xn1) exp( i

n 1xk=0

(2.12)

the main goal is to nd the solution to (2.10) such that ee  l2(rn 1) . in equivalent terms,

we impose the requirement

z f (e1)e(x0, x)de1  l2(rn )

for any smooth function f (y) , (y  r) with nite support.

3 main results

theorem 3.1 the solution to the spectral problem (2.10), (2.13) can be represented as the

(ii) the function c(; e) is the solution of multi-dimensional baxter equation in the pasquier-

gaudin form [9]

c(; e) =

n 1yj=1

c+(j; e)  (e)c(j; e)
h(cid:16)j  k(e)(cid:17)

(3.3)

where the entire functions c() are two gutzwiller solutions [3] of one-dimensional baxter
equation

t(; e)c(; e) = in c( + ih; e) + in c(  ih; e)

(3.4)

and the parameters (e),  = (1(e), . . . , n(e) ) satisfy the gutzwiller conditions (the
energy quantization) [3, 9].

(iii) the wave function ,e1(x0, x) is dened in terms of whittaker function w(x; ) [4]-[6]

for the gl(n1; r) open toda chain [7, 8]

the function (3.5) is symmetric under the permutation of  -variables 1.

the multiple integral (3.1) can be explicitely evaluated. let y = (y1, . . . , yn) be an arbitrary
vector in rn . we denote y(s)  (y1, . . . , ys1, ys+1, . . . , yn)  rn 1
theorem 3.2 assuming that j(e) 6= k(e) , the solution (3.1) can be written (up to unessen-

4 gl(n1, r) toda chain and whittaker function

it can be easily shown that the operator

b() = ex0

n 1xk=0
(1)kn k1hk(x1, p1; . . . ; xn1, pn1)

(4.1)

is the generating function for the hamiltonians hk of gl(n 1) toda chain 2. in particular,
the simplest hamiltonians have the form

h1 =

h2 =xj<k

pk

n 1xk=1
n 2xk=1
pjpk 

exkxk+1

(4.2)

let  = (1, . . . , n1) be the set of real parameters. we consider the spectral problem for
gl(n1, r) toda chain

hk(x) = k()(x)

k = 1, . . . , n  1

(4.3)

where k() are elementary symmetric functions. in equivalent terms, (x) satises to the
equation

as a trivial corollary,

b()(x) = ex0

n 1ym=1

(  m) (x)

b(j)(x) = 0

(4.4)

(4.5)

remark 4.1 the equations (4.5) are an analog of the notion of the operator zeros introduced
by sklyanin [2].

obviously, in the asymptotic region xk+1  xk, (k = 1, . . . , n2) all potentials vanish and the
solution to (4.3) is a superposition of plane waves. the main goal is to nd the solution to (4.3)
satisfying the following properties:

(i) the solution vanishes very rapidly 3 as xk  xk+1   for any given k .
(ii) the function  is weyl-invariant, i.e. it is symmetric under any permutation

...j...k... = ...k...j...

(4.6)

2the commutativity of the operators hk follows from the commutation relation [b(), b()] = 0 which is

encoded in (2.6).

3 more precisely,  (x)  exp{ 2

h e(xkxk+1)/2} as xk  xk+1   .

the property (i) denes the unique solution (up to common  -dependent factor). it is called
the whittaker function w(x; ) whose analytical and invariant properties were studied in [4]-[6].
in the context of the open toda chain the whittaker functions have been appeared for the rst
time in [7, 8]. the requirement of weyl invariance (4.6) is very convenient for our purposes. it
turns out that symmetric function  is most suitable to construct the solution for the periodic
toda chain.

for gl(n1, r) toda chain the whittaker function has the following integral representation

with unit diagonal and k(z) are the principal minors of the matrix zzt . finally, (., .) is the
standard scalar product in rn 1 .
in particular, taking n = 3 and using the integral representation for the macdonald function
k(y) , one obtains the appropriate solution

(4.13)

lemma 4.2 the whittaker function w(x; ) can be analytically continued to an entire function

group of the variables  ). the functions v(x; s), (s  w ) form a basis of the solutions to the
spectral problem (4.3).

lemma 4.4 the whittaker function (4.7) has the following expansion in terms of basis func-
tions v(x; s) , (s  w ) :

proof. the weyl invariance is a direct corollary of the formulae (4.10), (4.11).
to prove (ii), one should note that the poles coming from  functions in the r.h.s. of (4.18) are
cancelled by the corresponding zeros of the whittaker function w(x; ) . indeed, the function
m(sjk; ) has the poles at j  k = ih(n + 1
2) , (n  n) . but the function w(x; sjk) is
an entire function according to lemma 4.2. hence, from (4.10) it is clear that w(x; ) vanishes
exactly at the same points.

for brevity. then the harish-chandra function (4.16) is written identically as a ratio

while the denition (4.18) reads

c() =

a()
b()

(x)  n()b()w(x; )

using the weyl invariance s =  , one easily nds from (4.10) and (4.24)

m(s; ) =

n(s)

hence, the expansion (4.19) is a simple corollary of (4.15) and denition (4.24).
the proof of (iv) follows from the stirling formula for  -functions and from the calculation of
the integrals in (4.7) by the stationary phase method 7.

(5.1)

where  is an arbitrary real parameter. obviously, this function is the solutions of (4.3) or, in

(  m) ,(x0, x)

in particular,

 j  
further, by construction the function , satises to the equation

b(j),(x0, x) = 0

the scalar product of the auxiliary functions follows from (4.26):

moreover, the auxiliary functions satisfy to completeness condition

z

1(),(x0, x),(y0, y) d d = (n1)! (2h)n (x0  y0)(x  y)

(5.7)

8 we conrm this conjecture by explicit calculations for gl(2, r) chain. the general proof will be published

elsewhere.

provided the conjecture (4.27) holds.

certainly, the function (5.1) does not satisfy the whole system (2.10). nevertheless, it possesses
some remarkable properties which allow to construct the eigenfunctions of the periodic toda
chain.

first of all, the functions , and , can be extended to the entire functions of the complex
variables   cn 1 . this is an evident consequence of lemma 4.5. we shall denote the
corresponding analytic continuations by the same letters. further, the following statement will
be of importance below:

lemma 5.1 the action of the diagonal operators of the monodromy matrix (2.5) on auxiliary
function , (  cn 1) is dened by the formulae

a(j), = in +ihej,

d(j), = in ihej ,

proof. we consider the following commutation relations encoded in (2.6):

(   + ih)d()b() = (  )b()d() + ihd()b()
(   + ih)a()b() = (  )b()a() + iha()b()

(5.8a)

(5.8b)

(5.9)

(5.10)

taking  = j
to the relation

in (5.9) and applying this operator identity to the function (x) , one arrives

b()d(j)(x) = ex0 (  j + ih) ym6=j

(  m) d(j)(x)

(5.11)

since (4.5) holds 9 . hence, d(j)(x) is a solution to the spectral problem (4.4) with the set
of eigenvalues

i.e. one obtains the expansion

  (1, . . . , j1, j  ih, j+1, . . . , n1)
d(j)(x) = xsw

dj(s; ) v(x; s(  ihej))

(5.12)

(5.13)

due to completeness of the basis v(x; ) (s  w ) . on the other hand, the function d(j)(x)
vanishes as xkxk+1   for any given k . hence, the r.h.s. in (5.13) is proportional to ihej
because of uniqueness of the whittaker function. thus,

d(j)(x) = dj() ihej

(5.14)

to nd the coecients dj() , we consider the asymptotics in the region xk+1  xk , (k =
1, . . . n  2) where (4.14) holds. note that in this limit

(5.15)

d() = exn1x0(n 2ym=1

k=1(cid:17))
(  pm) + o(cid:16)maxnexkxk+1on2

9note that d() does not contain the operator p0 and, therefore, commutes with ex0 .

the comparison of (5.16) and (5.17) gives dj() = in ex0 . hence, in the region im k  0

d(j)(x) = in ex0ihej (x)

(5.18)

and this relation can be obviously continued to the whole complex region. the formula (5.8b)
follows then from the denition (5.1).
of course, it is possible to prove (5.8a) according to the same reasoning. actually, the relation
(5.8a) is a corollary of (5.8b) since the quantum determinant of the monodromy matrix (2.5) is
equal to 1. applying the operator identity

to the function , and using the relations (5.3) and (5.8b), one arrives to (5.8a).

a(j  ih)d(j)  c(j  ih)b(j) = 1

(5.19)

as a direct consequence of (5.8) and denition (2.7), for any   cn 1

bt(j), = in +ihej , + in ihej ,
bt (j), = in +ihej, + in ihej,

(5.20)

where bt (; x0, p0; . . . ; xn1, pn1)  bt(; x0,p0; . . . ; xn1,pn1) , (  c) and the analytic

continuation of the functions is understood.

remark 5.1 the formula (5.20) has been derived by gutzwiller [3] using cumbersome explicit
calculations for n = 2 and n = 3 -particle open toda chain.

to prove theorem 3.1 one needs to determine the action of the operator bt() (  c) on the

function , .

proof. the function bt(), is a polynomial in  of order n with the leading terms
according to (5.4). moreover, this polynomial is dened at the points  = j , (j = 1, . . . , n 1)
due to (5.20). using the standard interpolation formula, one easily obtains (5.21).

bt(), = (n  n 1), + o(n 2)

(5.22)

remark 5.2 the formula (5.21) is a coordinate version of the operator interpolation formula
obtained in [2].

6 periodic toda chain in  -representation

let e (x0, x) be the fast decreasing solution of the problem (2.10). we dene the function
c() by generalized fourier transform:

(e1  ) c(; e) =

z

e(x0, x) ,(x0, x)dx0dx

(6.1)

theorem 6.1 the function c() possesses the following properties:

(i) it is a symmetric function with respect to  -variables.
(ii) it is an entire function of the variables   cn 1 .
(iii) the function c() obeys the asymptotics

c()  |k|n/2e

n|k |

2h

(6.2)

as |k|   along the real axes.

(iv) the function c() satises the multi-dimensional baxter equation

t(j; e)c(; e) = in c( + ihej; e) + in c(  ihej; e)

(6.3)

where t(; e) is dened by (2.11).

proof. the symmetricity of the function c() is obvious.
we present here only the sketch of the proof concerning the statements (ii) and (iii).
the statement (ii) follows from the assertion that the auxiliary function , is an entire one
while the solution of the periodic chain vanishes very rapidly as |xkxk+1|   . 10.
(iii) the asymptotics (6.2) is a combination of two factors. the rst one comes from the asymp-
totics (4.21) which results from the stirling formula for the  -functions in the denition (4.18).

10 actually, the boundary conditions have the same importance here as the requirement of compact support

in the theory of the analytic continuation for the usual fourier transform.

13

the second factor  |k|1 exp{|k|/h} results from the stationary phase method while cal-
culating the multiple integral including the whittaker function (4.7). the calculation is based
heavily on the exact asymptotics of the function e (x0, x) as |xk  xk+1|   .
the proof of (iv) is simple. using the denition (2.10) and integrating by parts (evidently,
boundary terms vanish), one obtains

z nbt(j)e(x0, x)o ,(x0, x)dx0dx =

(6.4)

(e1  ) t(j; e)c() 

=

z

e(x0, x)nbt (j),(x0, x)odx0dx

taking into account the relation (5.20), the baxter equation (6.3) follows from denition (6.1).

let us consider the following function 11

e(x0, x) =

(2h)n
(n1)!

z

1() c(; e) ,e1(x0, x)d

(6.5)

the integral (6.5) integral is correctly dened. indeed, the measure

ih (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
1() = yj<k(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16) jk

2

=

= (h)(n1)(n2)/2 yj<k

h

is an entire function. therefore, there are no poles in the integrand. moreover,

1()  |k|n 2 expn

h

(n2)|k|o

(6.6)

(6.7)

as |k|   . taking into account the asymptotics (4.21) and (6.2) one concludes that the
integrand has the behavior  |k|1 exp{|k|/h} as |k|   . therefore, the integral (6.5)
is convergent.

using the scalar product (5.5), one can write the plancherel formula 12

e(x0, x)e(x0, x)dx0dx =

(n1)!

(e1e

z

1() c(; e)c(; e)d (6.8)

the integral in the r.h.s. of (6.8) is absolutely convergent due to asymptotics (6.2) and (6.7).
hence, the norm ||e || is nite modulo gl(1)  -function (e1e
1) (see corresponding factor
in (2.12) which results to this function).

11the expression (6.5) is an inversion formula to (6.1) assuming the completeness condition (5.7). otherwise

one can only conclude that (6.1) is a corollary of (6.5) due to the scalar product (5.5).

12 let us stress again that (6.8) is deeply connected with the plancherel formula for sl(n, r) toda chain

derived in [8].

14

remark 6.1 the scalar product in  -variables appears for the rst time in [2]. we see that
the sklyanin measure 1() is naturally connected with the harish-chandra function (4.23).

to prove that the function (6.5) satises to the spectral problem (2.10), one needs more details
information concerning the asymptotics of function c(; e) : it should exponentially decrease
in any nite strip of the complex plane k  c as |re k|   . then (6.5) is a solution if
c(; e) satises the baxter equation (6.3) (see the proof of theorem 3.1 below). up to now
we can prove only the asymptotics (6.2) starting from the denition (6.1) (though the analytic
continuation seems almost evident). therefore, in the next section we describe the explicit
solution to equation (6.3) [3, 9] which obviously possesses the required asymptotics.

7 solution of baxter equation

in this section the pasquier-gaudin solution [9] to the baxter equation (6.3) is described which
leads to rened derivation of gutzwiller quantization condition [3].

we solve the equation (6.3) in the separated form

c(; e) =

n 1yj=1

c(j; e)

(7.1)

obviously, the one particle functions c() satisfy to the one-dimensional baxter equation

t(; e) c(; e) = in c( + ih; e) + in c(  ih; e)

(7.2)

where t(; e) is, by denition, a polynomial

nqk=1
(  k(e)) . we assume that the roots k(e)
are real for the solutions with the nite norm 13. we shall oftenly do not write the explicit
dependence on energies for brevity.

this can be easily proved by expansion of these determinant with respect to the rst row. the

(ii) it is clear that

k() = 1 for real  . similarly, k()  1 as   i . the

in order to construct the solution with the asymptotics (6.2), one should recall that the solutions
(7.3) are dened up to any ih -periodic factor. clearly, the factor

(7.10)

(where k are an arbitrary parameters) does not spoil the asymptotics of the functions (7.4) as

one can consider the following solution of the baxter equation (7.2):

 = k + ihnk , nk  z, k = 1, . . . , n and the solution (7.11) is not an entire function in general.
the poles are cancelled only if the following conditions hold:

c+(k + ihnk) = c(k + ihnk)

in turn, this means that the wronskian

vanishes at  = k + ihnk . due to baxter equation (7.7)

w () = c+()c( + ih)  c+( + ih)c()

substitution of (7.4) to (7.14) gives

w ( + ih) = (1)n w ()

this innite determinant is absolutely convergent; h() is a meromorphic function with the
poles at the points k + inkh , (nk  z, k = 1, . . . , n) . the hill determinant is ih -periodic

is valid:

(7.24)

determine the energy spectrum of the problem. these have been obtained for the rst time by
gutzwiller [3] using quite dierent method.

8 proof of the main theorems

proof of theorem 3.1. we have proved already that the function e is integrable in a sense
of (6.8), (2.13). now we prove that the function (6.5) satises to the spectral problem (2.10) if the
entire solution c(; e) to the baxter equation (6.3) obeys the asymptotics  exp{ n
2h |re j|}

18

as |re j|   in the strip ih  im j  ih . note that the pasquier-gaudin solution (7.23)
satises to this requirement (see proof of lemma 7.2).

due to (5.21) one obtains 14

1( + ihj) = (1)n 1() ym6=j

the integration contours [  ih,  ih] can be deformed to the standard one [,] .
indeed, the corresponding integrands are the entire functions (all possible poles are cancelled by
appropriate zeros of the measure 1() , see (6.6)). moreover, it is not hard to see that the
integrand is exponentially decreasing in the strip ih  im j  ih as |re j|   . therefore,
the contour integral around the strip vanishes and all integrals in (8.3) can be deformed to the
standard ones. finally, using the baxter equation (6.3), one obtains from (8.3)

the expression in curly brackets is nothing but t(; e) according to interpolation formula and,
therefore, the function e is a solution to the spectral problem (2.10). note that the explicit
form of c(; e) is not required here.

14 we discard unessential numerical factor in (6.5).

19

proof of theorem 3.2. the proof is heavily based on conjecture that all the zeros of the hill
determinant are simple 15. to derive the formula (3.6) from (3.1) let us consider the integral
over 1 rst selecting the expression

by construction, it is an entire function but the expressions

h(cid:16)1  k(cid:17)

sinh 

c(1)

h(cid:16)1  k(cid:17)

has an innite number of poles. clearly, the original integral can be written as follows while
selecting the variable 1 and denoting the rest of variables as  :

(8.6)

(8.7)

h(cid:16)1  k(cid:17) 1() c()  =

h(cid:16)1  k(cid:17) c()

where the contour c+ encloses the poles k + ihnk, (nk  0 , k = 1, . . . , n) while the contour
c encloses the poles k + ihnk, (nk < 0 , k = 1, . . . , n) . such deformations of contours are
possible since the integrands in the r.h.s of (8.7) vanish exponentially on large upper and lower
semi-circles respectively; this follows from the asymptotics (7.8) and (7.9). now the integrals
can be calculated using the residue formula. note that c(k + ihnk) = c+(k + ihnk) according
to (7.13). hence, the nal expression can be written in terms of the function c+ only. the same
is true for the rest of integration.
let us consider the contribution coming from the residues 1 + ihn1 while integrating over 1 .
using the explicit expression for the measure

1()  yj>k

(jk) sinh


h

(jk)

(8.8)

one obtains the following contribution:

 xn1z

c+(1+ihn1)z d

n 1yk=2

(8.9)

((n1)!

nyk=2

sinh



h(cid:16)1k(cid:17))1

(8.10)

for a moment. now we consider the analogous integration over variable 2 . it is easy to see
that there are no poles at 2 = 1 + ihmk because of the factor sinh 
h (21) in the integrand

15 up to now we are unable to prove this conjecture though it seems very plausible.

20

in (8.9). quite similarly, while calculating the residues at 2 = 2 + ihn2 , one concludes
that the integration over 3 does not include the contribution from the points 1 + ihmk and
2 + ihsk and so on. therefore, the successive evaluation of the residues at well arranged
points k = k + ihnk, (k = 1, . . . , n1) gives the contribution

 xn1,...,nn1z

n 1yk=1

c+(k +ihnk)((n ) + hn(n ))1+ihn1,...,n1+ihnn 1

(8.11)

where () is the vandermonde determinant and the notation y(s) means the n  1 di-
mensional vector obtained from the corresponding n dimensional one by cancellation of the
s -th component, i.e. y(s)  (y1, . . . , ys1, ys+1, . . . , yn) . after a little algebra one nds that the
common factor to (8.11) is

(1)n (n 1)/2

(n1)!yj>k

sinh


h

(jk)

1

(8.12)

by construction the integrand in (3.1) is symmetric under the permutation of  -variables.
therefore, one obtains the same answer (8.11) while calculating all other possible residues from
the set (n ) + ihn(n ) . this gives the additional factor (n1)! .
the last step is to take into account the poles at n + ihnn . one can easy to show that
the calculation of the corresponding residues while integrating over s gives the additional
factor (1)n s to compare with (8.12). hence, one obtains the nal answer (up to unessential
numerical constant)

nxs=1
(1)n s xn(s)zn1
