1 introduction

in type iib string theory, there are many types of 7-branes labeled by two integers p and q,
which specify the sl(2, z) monodromies around them. if we go around a [p, q] 7-brane in the
anti-clockwise direction, we get a sl(2, z) monodromy m[p,q] dened by

m[p,q] =  1  pq
q2

p2

1 + pq ! ,

(1)

and to avoid multivalueness of elds and string charges, we should introduce branch cuts which
give sl(2, z) transformations compensating the monodromies. it was suggested by zwiebach
et al.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] that when 7-branes of the specic combination are on the top of each
other, various groups containing exceptional groups, ane groups, and other exotic groups
appear as gauge groups on the 7-branes. to construct an, dn and en gauge theories, we need
three types of 7-branes with labels [1, 0], [1, 1], and [1, 1]. following [1, 2], we call them
a-, b- and c-branes, respectively. the degrees of freedoms contributing the gauge symmetry
enhancement arise from string junctions connecting some of these 7-branes. the (p, q) charges
of strings attached on a 7-brane should be equal to the label of the 7-branes.

it is known that type iib theory compactied on s2, which is also expressed as a k3
compactication of f-theory, is dual to heterotic string theory compactied on t 2. on the s2,
we have 24 7-branes corresponding singular bers of elliptically bered k3. as was pointed
out in [5], the junction lattice of the type iib theory on s2 has signature (+18, 2), which is
the same with one of narain lattice of the heterotic string theory. because there is unique
18 + 2-dimensional lorentzian self-dual even lattice, it is rather trivial that the junction lattice
is identical with the narain lattice in the heterotic side. the purpose of the present paper is,

by means of dualities, to establish the one to one correspondence between invariant charges
of junctions in the type iib theory and the quantum numbers specifying perturbative states
of a heterotic string.

these two theories are dual to each other as the following way. on s2, we have 24 7-branes.
although there are many representations of these 24 7-branes, we restrict ourselves to the case
that these 7-branes are represented as four sets of a4bc. once we get some results for this
background, we can extend them to other region of moduli space by a continuous deformation
of background. in the weak coupling limit (gstr  0), a pair of a b-brane and a c-brane is
reduced to an orientifold 7-plane[7]. therefore, in this limit, we have four orientifold 7-planes
and the compactication manifold s2 becomes a t 2/z2 orientifold. by means of t duality
transformation along two directions on t 2/z2, the theory is transformed into type i theory
on t 2, and it is s dual of the so(32) heterotic string theory on t 2.

through this series of duality transformations, we can relate bps states in the heterotic
string theory to ones in the type iib theory. let us assume the two compactied directions
to be x8 and x9, and call momenta and winding numbers along them m8, m9, n8 and n9.
(generically, momenta m8 and m9 are not integers due to wilson lines while winding numbers
n8 and n9 are always integers.) in table 1, it is displayed how the states carrying these charges
are transformed by the dualities. as is known from this table, charges (p, q) ( = 8, 9) of

table 1: objects carrying charges m and n in each theories related by dualities each other.

strings winding along x8 and x9 directions in the type iib theory are represented by quantum
numbers of heterotic string as follows:

the factor 1/2 in the right hand sides of the second and the fourth equation in (2) is a
consequence of the fact that the t dual of a winding type i d-string is a half of type iia
d-particle on an orientifold 8-plane.

we should note that in generic 7-branes backgrounds, there is a certain subtlety concerning

the denition of winding numbers of strings in the type iib side. we will explain this in section
3 before giving the nal result.

2 spectrum of heterotic string

if we assume the left mover (without tilde) is supersymmetric and the right mover (with tilde)
is bosonic, the mass formula and the level matching condition for t d compactied heterotic
string theory are given by

the ns sector and 0 for the r-sector. the variables a

2d + 16-dimensional vector (a
so-called narain lattice. for simplicity, let us assume the torus t d is rectangular. then, the
zero modes are quantized as follows:

coordinates x  and the vector ea0 is zero-mode associated with the 16-dimensional internal

where r are compactication radii, k is a vector on a 16-dimensional self-dual even lattice ,
and w are wilson lines which take their values on the torus r16/. from this equation, we
can read modied momenta m, which are momenta containing the shift due to the wilson
line, as follows:

m = m + w  k 

w  wn,

(5)

where m and n are integers. now, we are considering so(32) heterotic string theory and 
should be the so(32) weight lattice, which is generated by the following basis:

i = ei  ei+1(i = 1, . . . , 15), 16 = e15 + e16, s =

1
2

16xi=1

ei,

(6)

where ei are orthonormal basis of r16. for the following argument, it is convenient to dene
the following 2d + 16-dimensional vector k.

k = (k, m10d, n10d, . . . , m8, n8, m9, n9).

furthermore, we introduce vectors w which satisfy

a
0 = w  k,
where the inner product is dened by using the metric

gm n =

for example, in s1 compactied case, the vector w9 is given by

w9 =

the vectors w also satisfy the equation

w  w =  .

(11)

therefore, they are orthonormal basis of d-dimensional sub-manifold with a negative denite
metric. the moduli parameters of the heterotic string theory are specied by giving this sub-
manifold and the string coupling constant, and this means that the moduli space of heterotic
string compactied on t d is

where r+ is associated with the string coupling constant gstr.

so(16 + d, d)

so(16 + d)  so(d)  r+,

the bps condition for heterotic string is

nosc + a = 0.

for bps states, the norm of k should be smaller than 2:

(12)

(14)

(15)

(16)

k2 = (ea0)2 + (ea

0 )2  (a

0 )2 = 2(fnosc +ea)  2.

eq.(14) corresponds to the bps condition for junctions (j  j)  2 given in [8, 9]. (in this
paper, we adopt opposite signature for intersection number to one in [2, 4].) mass formula is
rewritten as

m 2
4tstr

= (w  k)2.

especially, massless states should satisfy

w  k = 0.

eq.(16) dene a subspace with codimension d. because all of w have negative norm and the
whole space has signature (+d+16, d), this subspace has positive denite metric. because the
lattice on the subspace correspond to massless gauge elds, the sub-lattice is nothing but a
root lattice of gauge group. let us introduce the basis ui on the sub-lattice corresponding to
the fundamental weight. then, any vector k is expanded as follows:

k = aiui + cw.

(17)

the coecients ai give the dynkin label of the state associated with the vector k. on the
other hand, the coecients c give central charges of the state, because the mass square of
each state is given as the sum of the square of c.

(18)

when we compactify heterotic string theory on torus t d, new 2d u(1) elds appear from
the metric and the ns-ns 2-form eld, and at a generic point on moduli space, gauge group is
a subgroup of so(32) u(1)2d. for example, if we compactify the x8 direction and introduce
the following wilson line w8,

w8 =(cid:18)(cid:18)1
2(cid:19)n

, 016n(cid:19) ,

(n < 8),

(19)

then gauge symmetry is broken to so(2n)  so(32  2n)  u(1)2. if we adjust the compact-
ication radius to the value specied by

(20)

then some winding modes become massless and the gauge symmetry so(2n)u(1) is enhanced
to en+1. we can conrm this by observing the sub-lattice given by (16).

3 correspondence of states

in [3], it was shown that the junction lattice associated with the 7-brane background anbcbc

(n < 8) is identical to the root lattice of the ane lie algebra ben+1. in heterotic side, this

background corresponds to t 2 compactication with wilson line (19) and compactication
radius r8 satisfying (20). on the 7-brane background, in addition to junctions i associated
with nite lie algebra en+1, we have three independent junctions , 0, and (fig.1). an

as  in the table depend on the convention how we dene the junctions 0 and . by adding
 to them, we can x these components to arbitrary values. the correspondence of vector
ui in (17) and junctions i is rather trivial. here, we focus on how we can reproduce the
intersection ( ), which is independent from the convention. because three junctions 0, 
and  carry central charges and  and 0 respect the same supersymmetry, the contribution
of these three charges to the mass is expressed as follows:

m 2
4tstr

= (xk + yen)2 + z22,

(22)

where x, y and z are some constants. if we assume the components  in table 2 are zero, by
comparing this equation with eq.(18), we get the following correspondence between vectors on
narain lattice and junctions:

w8  z, w9  y0 + x.

(23)

the problem is how we should x the coecients x, y and z. about z, we can easily determine
it as follows. as is shown in fig.1, the junction  contains a string loop with r-r charge
q9 = 1/(8  n). by the relation (2), we know that the conguration  in the type iib side
corresponds to heterotic string with winding number n8 = 2/(8  n). on the other hand, the
n8 components of the vector w8 is ls/(2r8) = 2/8  n. therefore, we get

 

1

8  n

w8.

(24)

if we believe this correspondence, we can reproduce the self-intersection number of  in table

2 as an inner product of the vector:

(  ) =

1

8  n

w8  w8 = 

1

8  n

(25)

in this way, can we establish complete correspondence between quantum numbers of het-

erotic strings and invariant charges of junctions? probably, it is possible. however, it is

6

dicult. the origin of this diculty is the existence of congurations like . the position of
the d-string loop can be freely moved and the length of string attached on the loop depends
on the position. however, the information of the position is not contained in the quantum

numbers in the heterotic string side. therefore it is not clear how we should dene the winding
number in the type iib side using heterotic quantum number.

there is only one case where such subtlety does not exist. the reason why we need the
string attached on the string loop of the junction  is that the monodromy around the loop
changes the charge of the string loop. therefore, in the at background, where r-r charge

of each o7-plane is canceled by four d7-branes and the monodromy around the cycle is 1,
congurations like  is not allowed and denition of winding number is very clear. in the
heterotic side, the background is specied by the following wilson line.

w8 = (08, (1/2)8), w9 = (04, (1/2)4, 04, (1/2)4).

(26)

on this background, there is no subtlety concerning the denition of charges, and by means
of eq.(2), we can represent the winding number of strings in the type iib side by quantum
numbers in the heterotic side.
conguration with two string loops with charges (p, q).

if all the components of the vector ea0 vanish, we get the

vector ea0 = k  n8w8  n9w9 take nonzero values, each component should be regarded as

the number of strings attached on each d7-brane. as a result, we get a conguration in
fig.3.
in this case, the charge of the string loops are not constant on them, due to the
fundamental strings going between the loops and d7-branes. nevertheless, we can dene
the charge (p, q) of the junction uniquely as a half of charges which go through cycles

any segment in the conguration in fig.3 is determined by the information we have already

mentioned. in fig.(3), we assume that the branch cuts go outward. by means of continuous
deformation, we can collect all 16 d7-brane at the same position. as we move d7-branes,

the branch cuts attached on them are also moved. if the branch cut go across strings, the
charges of the strings change. and if a d7-brane goes across strings with d-string charge, the

number of strings attached on the d7-brane is changed by means of hanany-witten eect.
taking account of these fact, we get the conguration in fig.4. in this conguration, we have

separated each o7-plane into a b- and a c-brane, and we label obtained 24 7-branes a1,   ,
a16, b1, c1,   , b4, c4 in the anti-clockwise order. as a result, invariant charges of the

junctions are given as follows:

where s is dened by

qb1 = 0,

qc1 = 0,
qb2 = m8 + n8  n9  s,
qc2 = m8 + n8  s,
qb3 = m8 + m9  n8 + s,
qc3 = m8 + m9  n9 + s,
qb4 = m9 + n9  s,
qc4 = m9  n8 + n9  s,

because vector k takes its value on the lattice , s is always integer.

junctions, which are dual to heterotic string states, should be proper, namely, their in-

variant charges should be integers. at rst sight, however, the equation (27) gives fractional
charges qai when k contains odd number of spinor root s in (6). we can always make this
junction proper by adding null junctions. we have two independent null junctions n1 and
n2, which go around the whole 24 junctions. because the compactication manifold is s2,
these junctions are shrinkable to a point. they have the following invariant charges:

n1 : (016, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), n2 : (116, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1).

(37)

if all qai of a junction are half odd integer, by adding null junction (n1 + n2)/2, we can make
it a proper junction. furthermore, using null junctions, we can x any two of qbi and qci to
any values, and in the relations (27-35) we adopted a convention with qb1 = qc1 = 0.

at last, let us conrm that the intersection number dened in [2] is consistent with inner

product of vector k. according to [2], the intersection number among unit junctions are

(ai  aj) = (bi  bj) = (ci  cj) = ij,

(ai  bj) = 
(bi  cj) =( 1 (i  j)

(i > j)

,

(ai  cj) =

,

(38)

(39)

(in our convention, intersection numbers have opposite signs to ones in [2].) using these
equations, we get

(j  j) = k2 + 2m8n8 + 2m9n9.

(40)

and this is identical with the inner product k2 on the narain lattice.

4 conclusion

we established the correspondence between the quantum numbers of heterotic strings com-
pactied on t 2 and invariant charges of junctions on s2 with 24 7-branes. in order to nd
the relations, we used the at background in type iib side. however, once we get the re-
lations (27-35), they are available for non-at background because both the junction lattice
and narain lattice are discrete and the relations between them are invariant under continuous
deformation of moduli parameters. for example, applying the formulae to a vector w8 with
the wilson line (19), we get the junction . unfortunately, this fact does not mean that any
junctions on arbitrary background in type iib theory can be mapped into heterotic string.
the moduli space of the type iib theory is equal to the moduli space of k3 compactication.
it is known that moduli space of k3 manifold is

and this is larger than the perturbative moduli space of heterotic string (12).
