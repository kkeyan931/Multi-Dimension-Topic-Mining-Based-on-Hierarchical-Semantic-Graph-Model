abstract

some generalized brs transformations are developed for the pure yang-mills theory,

and a form of quantum gravity. unlike the usual brs transformations: these are nonlocal;

may be innite formal power series in the gauge elds; and do not leave the actio n
invariant, but only the product es with the jacobian. similar constructions should

exist for many other eld theory situations.

i.introduction

since the development of brs transformations for the yang-mills theory, [1], they

have played a major role in theoretical applications, such as to the study of renormal-

ization and unitarity. brs transformations have also been given for quantum gravity [2]

,[3],[4], and applied to study the renormalizability of higher derivative quantum gravity,

[4]. our interest was to develop a brs transformation for a particular formulation of

quantum gravity in a natural gauge to the theory, [5]. this led us to develop the gen-

eralized brs transformations of this paper, and to apply them to the pure yang-mills

theory. the yang-mills setting is a simpler arena to present the basic ideas, and hopefully

generalized brs transformations may have application to the yang-mills theory. there

has been study of some aspects of the yang-mills theory by other generalizations of the

brs symmetry,[6].

for the pure yang-mills we write the action as follows:

s = z tr[f2

 +


2

(a)2 + ci(l

 li)(lj + [a, lj])cj].

(1)

the superscript l indicates dierentiation is to the left, and ci is the ghost eld. sum

over repeated indices will always be understood, except where otherwise indicated.

the brs transformations are then:

a(x)  a(x) + (cj(x))lj  + [a(x), lj]cj(x).

cj(x)  cj(x)  (




)a

j (x).

cj(x)  cj(x) +

sjc(x)c(x).

(2)

(3)

(4)

we work in euclidean space, and the li are orthonormal in the trace inner product.

these transformations leave the action invariant and have (super -) jacobian 1 (of course

working to linear order in ). the structure constants satisfy:

sij = tr(li[lj, l]).

(5)

ii generalized brs transformations for the pure yang-mills

in contrast to (2),(3),(4) the generalized brs transformations for the pure yang-mills

theory will involve a rather arbitrary formal gauge transformation and are given as:

a(x)  a(x) +



x [cj(x) + zy

fj(x, y)cj(y)]lj

+ [a(x), lj][cj(x) + zy

fj(x, y)cj(y)]

(6)

ci(x)  ci(x)  (

cj(x)  cj(x) +

2

sjc(x)c(x) + zy zz

zj(x, y, z)c(y)c(z)

(8)

here fj(x, y) is an essentially arbitrary formal power series in the a eld with the

lowest order term of degree 1.

fj(x, y) = f 1

j (x, y) + f 2

j (x, y) + ...

f i

j (x, y) is of degree i. f 1, say, is of form:

j (x, y) = zz
f 1

f i
j (x, y, z, )ai

(z)

(10)

where

a(x) = iai

(x)li

(11)

the gi and zj are determined as formal power series in the a, inductively by

degree, as will be specied below. if fj  0 one gets the usual brs transformation. if

to order one in  we write:

s  s + s

j = 1 + j

(12)

(13)

where j is the jacobian of the transformation (6) (8), then we require:

(14)
which ensures invariance of r es (i.e. invariance of es times integration measure den-
sity).

s  j = 0

we write

s = s1 + s2

j = j1 + j2

(15)

(16)

where the subscripts 1 and 2 split the expressions into terms linear and quadratic in

ci(x). eq. (14) becomes two equations:

s1  j1 = 0

s2  j2 = 0

it is easy to see:

the equations (18)(19) are just:

j2 = 0

s2 = 0

(20)

which by a simple calculation holds for z satisfying:

xzi(x, y, z) +






x (a


x [(

x [as

x

(x)zs(x, y, z))sirs

f(x, y))(z  x)]si

(x)f(x, y)(z  x)]srssir = 0

(21)

(z  x) is a four dimensional delta function. equation (21) may be solved inductively

in degree for z a formal power series in the elds a(x), similar to f(x, y).

in equation (21) indices i, ,  are never summed!

with f(x, y) given, and zi(x, y, z) now determined, gi(x) is obtained from

equation (17), completely specifying the generalized brs transformation (6)(8). simi-

larly to the derivation of zi(x, y, z), equation ( 17) holds if gi(x) satises;

ygi(y)  (

(22)

this equation may be solved inductively as a formal power series in a(x) for gi.the

familiar notation for functional derivative has been used, and commas indicate partial

derivatives. index i is never summed over! the last term is eq.(22) is delicate to calcu-

late... the nitty-gritty yet awaits a proper exegesis.
