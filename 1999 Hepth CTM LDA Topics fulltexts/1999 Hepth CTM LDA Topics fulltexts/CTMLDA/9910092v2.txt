abstract

we study the thermodynamics of the large n non-commutative super
yang-mills theory in the strong t hooft coupling limit in the spirit of
ads/cft correspondence. although the thermodynamic quantities of near-
extremal d3-branes with ns b elds, which are dual gravity congurations of
the non-commutative n = 4 super yang-mills theory, are the same as those
without b elds, there are some dierences in the thermodynamics of the
ordinary and non-commutative super yang-mills theories. in particular we
discuss the dierences in three aspects. (1) we examine the 3r4 corrections
to the free energy and nd that they give a negative entropy correction. this
is consistent with the expectation that because of the non-commutative nature
of the spacetime coordinates, there is a reduction of the degrees of freedom
in the ultraviolet regime, compared to the ordinary case. (2) we nd that
the stress-energy tensor of the super yang-mills is not isotropic and its trace
does not vanish, which conrms that the non-commutative super yang-mills
theory is not conformal even in four dimensions. (3) we consider the ther-
modynamics of a probe d3-brane in the near-extremal d3-brane background.
the entropy of the probe is increased relative to that in the background with-
out b eld, which suggests that in the low-temperature and weak coupling
limit the one-loop contribution would not be exponentially suppressed for the
non-commutative super yang-mills theory.

i. introduction

the super yang-mills theory (sym) on non-commutative spaces is a natural generaliza-
tion of the sym on the ordinary commutative spaces. such a non-commutative sym has
been found to arise naturally in a certain limit of string theory with ns b elds [15]. the
spirit of the ads/cft correspondence [69] leads one to try to nd out the supergravity
dual of the non-commutative sym. recently hashimoto and itzhaki [10], and maldacena
and russo [11] constructed independently the supergravity dual congurations of the non-
commutative syms, which are the decoupling limits of d-brane solutions with ns b elds.
some of the latter have been also constructed in [1214] before.1 the supergravity dual of
the non-commutative sym can also be constructed by using the relationship between the
open string moduli and closed string moduli [16]. in this construction, the only input is a
simple form of the running string tension as a function of energy.

in the ads/cft correspondence, of particular interest is the d3-brane solution.

its
decoupling limit has the structure ads5  s5, and the type iib string theory on this back-
ground is supposed to be dual to the four-dimensional n =4 sym in the large n and strong
t hooft coupling limit. at nite temperature the theory is described by the near-extremal
d3-brane conguration [6,17]. according to the ads/cft correspondence, the decoupling
limit of d3-brane solutions with b elds is supposed to be the dual gravity description of
the non-commutative sym in four dimensions [10,11]. an interesting question then arises:
are the total numbers of degrees of freedom the same for the non-commutative and ordinary
syms at a given scale? maldacena and russo [11] have discussed the thermodynamics of
near-extremal d3-branes with b elds and found that the entropy and other thermody-
namic quantities are the same as those of the corresponding d3-branes without b elds.
on this basis, they argued that the total number of physical degrees of freedom of the
non-commutative sym at a given scale coincides with the ordinary case.

in the present paper we would like to investigate further aspects of thermodynamics of
the non-commutative sym from the supergravity side and compare them with the ordinary
sym cases.
in section ii, we introduce the black d3-brane solutions with ns b elds
and calculate some of their thermodynamic quantities. most of the results are known, but
these are needed to compare with our results. this also serves to establish our notation.
in section iii we calculate the corrections from the higher derivative terms (3r4) to the
free energy of the non-commutative sym. we nd that there is a signicant dierence
between the corrections in the ordinary and non-commutative cases. the result is that
the entropy for the non-commutative sym is reduced compared with the ordinary case,
consistent with the expectation that the number of degrees of freedom is reduced because
of the non-commutative nature of spacetime at high energy.

in section iv, we compute the stress-energy tensor of the non-commutative sym on the
supergravity side. as is already known, the thermal excitations of d3-branes without b
elds are of the form of an ideal gas in four dimensions. the entropy of near-extremal d3-
branes can be accounted for by the ideal gas model [18]; its stress-energy tensor is isotropic
and its trace vanishes [19], which conrms that the sym is conformally invariant in four

1these and more general solutions are also discussed in [15] in iia, iib and d = 11 supergravities.

dimensions. our result shows that the stress-energy tensor of the non-commutative sym is
not isotropic and its trace does not vanish, which reects the fact that the non-commutative
sym is not conformal even in four dimensions. in section v we consider the thermodynamics
of a static probe d3-brane in the background produced by near-extremal d3-branes with b
elds. according to the interpretation of the d-brane action, the supergravity interaction
potential between the probe and the source d3-branes can be interpreted as the contribution
of massive states to the free energy of sym when the sym is in the higgs phase, and the
distance between the probe and the source can be regarded as a mass scale of the sym.
from the thermodynamics of probe, we nd another dierence between the two cases. the
entropy of the non-commutative sym is increased, compared to the ordinary case. section
vi is devoted to the summary of our results and discussions.

ii. the black d3-brane solution with b field and its

thermodynamics

the supergravity solution corresponding to d3-branes with a nonvanishing ns b elds
has been constructed in [12] and [14]. the simplest way to get the solution is to start
with a d3-brane solution without b eld. first make t-duality along x3 (the world-volume
coordinates are x0, x1, x2 and x3), which gives a d2-brane solution with a smeared coordinate
x3, perform a rotation with an angle  in the x2-x3 plane and then t-dualize back on x3.
this procedure yields the desired solution with a nonvanishing b eld along x2 and x3
directions [11]. the prescription is also applicable to the black d3-brane solutions. the
black d3-brane solution with b eld along x2 and x3 directions can be written in the string
metric as

ds2 = h 1/2[f dx2

0 + dx2

1 + h(dx2

2 + dx2

and g = gb is the value of the string coupling in the ir and r4 = 4gn = 2g2
the t hooft coupling constant of gauge theory.

ymn   is
let us rst discuss the extremal case f = 1 in the solution (2.4). the solution (2.4)
reduces to the familiar product spacetime ads5  s5 for a = 0, while it deviates from the
anti-de sitter space for a 6= 0. thus, in the spirit of ads/cft correspondence the solution
(2.4) is proposed to be the gravity dual of the non-commutative sym and the parameter a
reects the non-commutative nature of space. when u  0, the solution (2.4) approaches
the ads5s5, which corresponds to the ir regime of the gauge theory. this is in agreement
with the expectation that the non-commutative sym reduces to the ordinary sym at long
distances.

next, for non-extremal solution (2.4), just like the pure black d3-brane case, the ther-
modynamics of the non-extremal solution (2.4) should be equivalent to that of the non-
commutative sym in the large n and strong t hooft coupling limit. however, the solution
(2.4) is neither asymptotically at nor asymptotically anti-de sitter. hence it is dicult
to calculate the energy excitation of the non-commutative sym directly from the solution
(2.4). to discuss the thermodynamics of the non-commutative theory, we rather start with
the black d3-brane solution (2.1). for our purpose, it is convenient to rewrite the solution
in the einstein frame, which has the following form:

ds2

e = h1/4h 1/2[f dx2

0 + dx2

1 + h(dx2

2 + dx2

3)] + h1/4h 1/2[f 1dr2 + r2d2
5].

(2.6)

we can further make compactication of the d3-brane world-volume and go to the einstein
frame. from the metric, we can easily obtain the adm mass m, hawking temperature t
and entropy s of the solution, which are found to be

(2.7)

where g10 = 236g24 is the gravitational constant in ten dimensions and v3 is the spatial
volume of the world-volume of the d3-brane. we are interested in comparing these ther-
modynamic quantities with those of black d3-branes without b elds. we have just found
that these quantities are independent of the parameter . thus they are exactly the same
as those without b eld [20].2

2the results in [20] are for rotating d3-branes. for a comparison, take l = 0 in the corresponding
quantities in [20].

4

in the decoupling limit, the excitation above the extremality of the black d3-brane
corresponds to a thermal state of the corresponding sym. considering the limit (2.3), from
(2.7) we have the energy e, temperature t and entropy of the large n non-commutative
sym in the strong coupling limit:

(2.8)

where v3 = b2v3/2. obviously these thermodynamic quantities satisfy the rst law of
thermodynamics de = t ds. the free energy f of the gauge theory, dened as f = e t s,
can be expressed in terms of the temperature:

f =

v3n 2t 4.

(2.9)

of course, the free energy is also the same as that of ordinary sym [18,21]. this result is
quite interesting, which leads maldacena and russo [11] to argue that at a given scale the
total number of degrees of freedom of the non-commutative sym coincides with the ordinary
case. no doubt it would be of much interest to further investigate this result and try to see
if this is modied by any corrections. motivated by this observation, we are now going to
compute the higher derivative term corrections to the free energy of the non-commutative
sym.

iii. the 3r4 corrections to the free energy

the black conguration (2.1) is an exact solution of type iib supergravity, which is a
low-energy approximation of superstring, keeping only the leading contribution of massless
states in the  expansion. the non-leading contributions from massive string states appear
as corrections to this low-energy action in the form of higher derivative curvature terms.
in type iib supergravity the lowest correction can be symbolically written as 3r4
,
where r represents the riemann tensor of spacetime. exploiting the eld redenition
ambiguity, the correction can be written in the einstein frame as [21]



16g10 z d10xge3/2(cid:20)c hmnkcpmnqc rsp

i1 = 
where  = (3)3/8 and cpqmn denotes weyl tensor. such corrections to the free energy
of the sym on the three-torus t 3, the three-sphere s3, and even on a hyperbolic space h 3
have been calculated in [2124]. in the einstein frame the decoupling limit metric of the
black d3-brane solution with b eld can be expressed as

the integrand reduces to 180u16
0 /r13 for a = 0, which precisely agrees with the result for
schwarzschild-anti-de sitter black holes [21,23,24]. for a nonzero a, the integration (3.3)
gives a divergent result. this is caused by the fact, as mentioned above, that the solution
(3.2) is neither asymptotically at nor asymptotically anti-de sitter. therefore, as usual, we
should dene the free energy by subtracting the contribution from a reference background
geometry which we take the extremal background with u0 = 0. note that this does not
aect the value of the integrand for a = 0. after this subtraction, we get a nite value:

(3.4)

when a  0, the term in the square bracket in (3.4) does not give the expected value 15 for
the schwarzschild-anti-de sitter black hole, but a surprising value 167/567, much smaller
than 15. it may appear that this is impossible, but a closer examination of the integrand
in (3.3) reveals the origin of this strange behavior. if we change the integration variable as
x = ar, we nd that the second term,4 which naively vanishes in the a  0 limit, actually
gives a nite contribution after the integration in the limit. this term is absent for ordinary
sym theory, and our result is consistent with [21,23,24]. that this correction changes its
sign has a great signicance.

3 here we have used the so-called simplied method, in which we put the unperturbed metric
into the correction term of the action to get the free energy. this method has been proved to be
valid to the rst order even if one considers the perturbed metric [2124]. we expect that this is
applicable here as well.

4the rst term is absent after subtraction.

6

from this correction term to the free energy, one may obtain the correction to the entropy
by s1 = (f1)/t . the result given above implies that even for a very small a, the
correction term is changed drastically. furthermore, for small a, the correction to the free
energy is positive and therefore the total free energy increases, compared to the uncorrected
free energy f in (2.9). thus, the entropy decreases in the high-temperature regime due
to the higher derivative term correction (we have checked this numerically). this is quite
dierent from the ordinary sym on the t 3, where the corrected entropy is found to increase
when the higher derivative corrections are taken into account [21]. that the higher derivative
terms, which just reect the short-distance eect, gives a negative entropy correction in our
case is in fact consistent with the expectation that there might be a reduction of the degrees
of freedom relative to the usual gauge theory [11] because of the non-commutative nature of
spacetime coordinates in the ultraviolet regime. though we have checked this numerically
in the lowest nontrivial order in the  expansion, our result gives an explicit evidence of
this reduction.

iv. the stress-energy tensor of the non-commutative sym

in section ii we have seen that the entropy of the non-commutative sym is the same as
that of the sym at a given temperature scale or energy scale. however, from (3.2) we see
that, when u  , the area of the torus x2, x3 contracts, while the radius of the s5 expands.
the contraction of area of the torus is just compensated by the expansion of the volume of
the s5. this seems to imply that there is a redistribution of the degrees of freedom [11]. to
compare the distribution of thermal states between the non-commutative sym and ordinary
sym, it is enough to calculate the stress-energy tensor of the non-commutative sym on the
supergravity side.

for this purpose, we adopt the method developed by myers [19] by generalizing the adm
mass density formula of p-branes [25]. the stress-energy tensor for the p-brane world-volume
can be expressed as

tab =

(4.1)

where ni is a radial unit in the transverse subspace, while h = g   is the deviation
of the (einstein frame) metric from that for at space. the labels a, b = 0, 1,   , p run
over the world-volume directions, while i, j = 1, 2,   , 9  p denote the transverse direc-
tions. in addition, it should be reminded that the calculations in (4.1) must be done using
asymptotically cartesian coordinates.

rewriting the einstein metric (2.6) in isotropic coordinates, one has

e = h1/4h 1/2[f dx2

(4.7)

for  = 0, eq. (4.6) reduces to the result for the ordinary sym, which is of the form of an
ideal gas in 3+1 dimensions. in that case, its trace is zero. this is in accordance with the
fact that the ordinary sym is conformally invariant in four dimensions. on the other hand,
for  6= 0, eq. (4.6) gives the stress-energy tensor for the non-commutative sym. in this
case, the tensor is not isotropic and its trace does not vanish. it reects the fact that the
non-commutative sym is not conformal even in four dimensions. in addition, we conrm
that the t00 component of the stress-energy tensor (4.6) in the decoupling limit indeed gives
the energy density of the non-commutative sym given in (2.8).

v. the thermodynamics of a probe brane

we know that the solution (2.1) describes n d3-branes coinciding with each other. the
conguration represents the non-commutative sym with gauge group u(n) in the higgs
branch, in which the vevs of scalar elds are zero. therefore the thermodynamics given
in section ii is the one for non-commutative sym in the higgs branch. we now want
to discuss the thermodynamics of the non-commutative sym in the coulomb branch, in
which the vevs of some scalar elds do not vanish. corresponding to the coulomb branch
should be a multicenter conguration of d3-brane solutions. one of the simplest cases is
that n parallel coinciding d3-branes are separated along a single transverse direction by a
distance from a single d3-brane. the gauge symmetry is then broken from u(n + 1) to
u(n)  u(1) and the distance can be regarded as a mass scale in the gauge eld. however,
no stable, multicenter, non-extremal congurations of d-branes have been known.5 as an

5it is possible to have non-extremal congurations for continuously distributed d-branes. for
d3-branes, see [26,27], for example.

approximation, one may consider the probe method. that is, we put an unexcited probe
brane in the background of other non-extremal d-branes and regard this as an approximate
multicenter solution. such a method has been used recently to study the thermodynamics
of sym in the higgs phase [2831].

considering that the non-commutative and ordinary syms have the same thermody-
namics at a given scale in the higgs branch, it would be interesting to compare them also in
the coulomb branch. to this aim, in this section, we investigate the thermodynamics of a
probe in the non-extremal d3-brane background. according to the interpretation of d-brane
action, the supergravity interaction potential between the probe and the near-extremal d3-
branes (as the source) can be interpreted as the contribution of massive states to the free
energy of gauge elds in the large n and strong t hooft coupling limit [28]. the dynamics
of a probe d3-brane is governed by the following action:

s = t3z d4xeq det( g  b(1))  t3z c,

where t3 = 1/(2)32 is the tension of d3-brane.

perature of the black d3-branes. the euclidean action (5.1) also includes the contribution

has the form t 8/u4. this is consistent with the expectation that, in the weak coupling
and low-temperature limit, the contributions of one- and two-loops are exponentially sup-
pressed [28,29]. the leading term is a three-loop contribution. however, for the non-
commutative sym, the parameter a is not zero. thus the rst term in (5.7) gives an
additional contribution, compared to the ordinary case. that is, in the non-commutative
sym, the leading term has the form t 4. this implies that in the weak coupling limit, there
should be one-loop and two-loop contributions for the non-commutative sym, in contrast
to the ordinary sym. this is a prediction from our above calculation.

in the high-temperature or short-distance limit, we have to use the isotropic coordinates

dened in (4.3).8 dening the mass scale m = (2  u0), we obtain

for a = 0, eq. (5.10) reduces to the result for the ordinary sym [28,29].

6there is a small dierence between the probe free energies in [28] and [29], which arises as
follows. in the decoupling limit, although h0 
2r4u4 , the dierence h0  h
does not vanish, but gives a nite value u4
2u4 . this is just the additional term appearing in [29].
the additional term is important in the interpretation of the probe free energy. the additional
term is also absent in [30,31].

let us compare this with the free energy in the weak coupling limit. the one-loop

(5.11)

it is very similar to that for the strong coupling limit (5.10) except the term (m/t ) is
absent in the weak coupling. in particular, in the massless approximation keeping only the
leading terms in (5.10) and (5.11), one may see that there is also the well-known dierence
by a factor of 3/4, which occurs in comparing the supergravity calculation and weak coupling
calculation of the entropy for the n =4 sym in the higgs branch [18,21].
for a 6= 0, we see from (5.10) that the free energy and then the entropy are increased
for the non-commutative sym, compared to the ordinary case. this is again in agreement
with the low-temperature expansion (5.7). our result implies that the one-loop free energy
would increase for the non-commutative sym in the weak coupling limit as well.

given the free energy of the probe, one may get the entropy and heat capacity of the

probe by

sp = 

fp
t

, c = t

sp
t

.

(5.12)

due to the appearance of the square root in (5.6), one nds that the entropy and heat
capacity of the probe are divergent when u = u0, which means that the probe is just at
the horizon of the black d3-brane. from the point of view of eld theory, it implies that
for a xed mass scale, there is a maximal temperature limit [28], beyond which the system
will be unstable thermodynamically. the critical temperature is independent of the non-
commutativity parameter a. that is, the critical temperature is the same for both the
ordinary and non-commutative syms. furthermore, the divergence of the entropy and
heat capacity of the probe means that there is some kind of phase transition for the gauge
theory in the coulomb branch. note that there is no phase transition for the gauge theory
on the t 3 in the higgs branch.

vi. conclusions

to summarize, we have investigated some aspects of thermodynamics for the non-
commutative sym in the large n and strong t hooft coupling limit on the supergravity
side. although the entropy and other thermodynamic quantities of black d3-branes with
ns b elds are the same as those without b elds, the stress-energy tensor of thermal
excitations is dierent. for the ordinary sym the stress-energy tensor is of the form of
an ideal gas in four dimensions. it is isotropic and its trace is zero. on the other hand,
for the non-commutative sym, the tensor is not isotropic and its trace does not vanish,
which conrms that the non-commutative sym is not conformally invariant even in four
dimensions. note that in the solution (2.1) the ns b eld has component only in x2, x3
directions. it means that the coordinates x2 and x3 are non-commutative, while x0 and x1
are the ordinary commutative coordinates. one may consider d3-brane solutions with both

11

b01 and b23 components. we do not expect that the stress-energy tensor will be isotropic in
that case either if the non-commutativity measurements are dierent for dierent directions.
we have considered the higher derivative term corrections to the free energy of the non-
commutative sym, which shows quite dierent behavior from the case of ordinary sym. in
particular, even for a small parameter a, the correction changes drastically. the negative
free energy correction becomes positive.
it means that the higher derivative terms may
give a negative entropy correction to that of the non-commutative sym. this makes a
sharp contrast to the ordinary case where the higher derivative terms always give a positive
entropy correction. this result is in agreement with the expectation that in the ultraviolet
regime there may be a reduction of the degrees of freedom because of the non-commutative
nature of spacetime, compared to the ordinary case.

we have also studied the thermodynamics of a probe in the background produced by the
black d3-branes with b elds and compared it with that in the background produced by
the black d3-branes without b elds. in accordance with the interpretation of the d-brane
action, the free energy of a static probe can be regarded as the contribution of massive states
to the free energy of non-commutative sym in the higgs phase and the distance between
the probe and the source can be explained as a mass scale in the gauge theory. from the
thermodynamics of the probe we have also found the dierence between the ordinary and
non-commutative cases. the free energy and then entropy of the non-commutative sym
increase, compared to the ordinary case. in particular, our result implies the existence of one-
loop contribution in the weak coupling limit of the non-commutative sym. note that in the
ordinary case, the one-loop and two-loop contributions are exponentially suppressed in the
weak coupling, while in the strong coupling limit, the one-loop and two-loop contributions
are absent.

in conclusion, from our calculations we nd that the thermodynamics of the ordinary
and non-commutative syms are dierent at some scale, and hence the total numbers of
degrees of freedom are also dierent for the two theories.
