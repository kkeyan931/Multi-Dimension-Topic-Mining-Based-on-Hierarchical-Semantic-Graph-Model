abstract

we consider the (2+1)-dimensional gauged thirring model in the heisen-
berg picture. in this context we evaluate the vacuum polarization tensor as
well as the corrected gauge boson propagator and address the issues of gener-
ation of mass and dynamics for the gauge boson (in the limits of qed3 and
thirring model as a gauge theory, respectively) due to the radiative correc-
tions.

1 introduction

the thirring model in (2+1) dimensions has been studied from diverse points of
view.
in [1], for example, the authors have considered this model, which is per-
turbatively nonrenormalizable, by using the 1/n expansion and showed that the
model is renormalizable in this context. the model has also been considered to
study dynamical generation of a parity-violating mass for fermions [2] aiming the
comprehension of such a mechanism in four-fermion interactions. this mechanism
could be useful for a better understanding of the large mass of top quark.

more recently, the d-dimensional (2  d < 4) thirring model was treated as a
gauge theory by making use of hidden local symmetry [3] and the general formal-
ism of batalin-fradkin for a constrained system [4] (for the abelian model these
formalisms are equivalent to the stuckelberg procedure [5]). the reason for the in-
troduction of a gauge symmetry is that the results for the issue of dynamical mass
generation were strongly dependent on the regularization scheme adopted. then,
the existence of a gauge symmetry would be useful in the sense that it restricts the
possible regularization schemes. this thirring model as a gauge theory (tmgt) has
revealed a very rich structure and was also used to study dynamical mass generation
[3, 4, 6].

in the tmgt the vector boson is an auxiliary eld at tree level, even though
radiative corrections generate dynamics for it [4, 7]. so, in [8] kondo has consid-
ered an extension of this model by introducing a maxwell term  1
4 ff  into
the lagrangian, obtaining a model which he called gauged thirring model. this
model has the attractive feature of comprise theories as diverses as qed3 (which is
superrenormalizable) and tmgt (nonrenormalizable) in the appropriate limits.

with this in mind, it would be of interest to consider the gauged thirring model
in the light of the heisenberg picture (hp), once there is no general proof of equiv-
alence between hp and the interaction picture (ip) in quantum eld theory, as
there is in ordinary quantum mechanics. so, in working with the gauged thirring
model, we can establish the equivalence between these pictures in a class of dierent
theories, including a nonrenormalizable one (tmgt).

moreover, despite of the great success of the perturbative techniques based on
feynman graphs expansion, we come into diculties when apply this formalism to
nonabelian and nonrenormalizable gauge theories [9, 10]. this occurs because in the
ip formulation of quantum eld theories we must split the lagrangian into free and
interacting parts, and none of this parts are invariants under brst transformations
(for a detailed exposition see [9, 10]). the hp, by its turn, does not suer of this
diculty because none of such splits is done.
instead we solve the equations of
motion for the interacting elds perturbatively, so that these eld operators are
given by power series in the coupling constant.

in this work we do not give a complete proof of equivalence of the (2+1)-
dimensional gauged thirring model in the interaction and heisenberg pictures, in-
stead we just evaluate the one loop vacuum polarization tensor and the corrected

2

gauge boson propagator in hp. in the sequence, we address the important matters of
dynamical mass generation (in the case of qed3 limit) and generation of dynamics
to the gauge boson (in the limit of tmgt).

by the way, we are also faced another interesting feature of the (2+1)-dimensional
theories, namely, the possibility of induction of a chern-simons (cs) term [11] due
to radiative corrections. as it is well known, theories involving a cs term have
applications in many elds, varying from pure mathematics to condensed matter
physics. however, another well stablished fact is that the coecient of the cs
term generated by loops corrections is plagued by a regularization ambiguity [4, 11].
here we will adopt the pauli-villars regularization [12] with a specic choice of the
regulators parameters [13], so that we obtain a nonvanishing value to the topological
mass in accordance with others schemes.

this paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we will set the notation and
review some basic aspects of the gauged thirring model. section 3 contains the
basic features of perturbation theory in the heisenberg picture. the vacuum po-
larization tensor calculations are presented in section 4. in section 5 we determine
the corrected gauge boson propagator and consider its limits for qed3 and tmgt.
finally, section 6 is reserved to our concluding remarks.

2 gauged thirring model

let us start recalling the lagrangian of the original massive thirring model in (2+1)
dimensions:

()() ,

(1)

l = i  m 

g
2

with the algebra for the  matrices in (2+1) dimensions given by

{, } = 2g,

 = g  i ,

(2)
where g = diag(1,1,1) and  is the totally antisymmetric levi-civita tensor.
this algebra can be realized by using the pauli matrices: 0 = 3, 1 = i1, 2 = i2.
in (1)  is a two component dirac spinor and the coupling constant g has
dimension of (mass)1. for the sake of convenience we will consider the fermion
mass positive (m > 0). this choice does not imply in loss of generality because
the fermion mass term breaks parity (besides, it also breaks time reversal). it must
be noted that the presence of this term in the lagrangian induces a chern-simons
term, which also breaks p and t symmetries, when radiative corrections are taken
into account.

of course, the model given by lagrangian (1) has no local u(1) invariance.
however, after linearizing the interaction by means of an auxiliary vector eld, we
can use the well known stuckelberg procedure [5] of introducing a neutral scalar
eld in such a way that we obtain a gauge invariant theory



l

= i(  iea)  m +

m 2
2

(a  )2 ,

(3)

3

where the scalar mode  is the stuckelberg eld and we have redened the coupling
constant as g def= e2
m 2 . then, it is simple to verify that (3) is invariant under the
gauge transformations



a  a
  
  



 = a +  ,
=  +  ,
= eie .



(4)

the lagrangian (3), after introducing a gauge xing and faddeev-popov ghost
terms, is called the thirring model as a gauge theory (tmgt) [3, 4]. an interesting
feature of this model is that the gauge boson a, which at tree level is an auxiliary
eld, becomes dynamical due to the radiative corrections [3, 4, 7]. nevertheless,
it is useful to introduce a gauge invariant kinetic term  1
4 ff  and to analyse
the eect of such a term [8]. this maxwell term, besides introducing dynamics
for the gauge boson, is also a kind of higher-covariant derivative term and so the
theory becomes renormalizable by power counting. even yet, the resulting theory
in not free of ultraviolet divergences and we must use some regularization scheme
to perform loop calculations.

in addition, we can consider the complete brst symmetric lagrangian by in-
troducing the gauge xing and faddeev-popov ghost terms so that we obtain, in
the r gauge, the so called gauged thirring model [8]

lgt h = la, + l + lgh ,

with the matter, stuckelberg and ghost lagrangians given, respectively, by

la, = id  m

2 ,

()2 

l =
lgh = ih(c)(c)  m 2cci .

where the covariant derivative is d =   iea.
from (6)-(8) we see that just the fermion elds and the gauge boson ones are
interacting. thus, we will concentrate on the matter lagrangian (6). in addition, it
should be stressed that, in spite of the mass term for the vector eld in (6), in this
case a is a true gauge eld due to the introduction of stuckelbergs eld. in fact,
the lagrangian (5) would be obtained more directly by starting from the lagrangian
of a massive vector eld (the proca eld) and applying the stuckelberg formalism.
however, the procedure outlined above is useful to illustrate the connection between
this model and the thirring one.

it is worth to consider some limits of the gauged thirring model. firstly, in the
   the boson kinetic term vanishes and the tmgt, where the gauge boson is

4

an auxiliary eld, is recovered. if, in addition, we take the unitary gauge   ,
we recover the original thirring model. another limit of interest is that in which
  1 and the gauge boson mass goes to zero m  0 (which, with e maintained
xed, corresponds to the limit of strong thirring coupling constant g  ), when
the matter lagrangian la, goes to the qed3 lagrangian.

3 perturbation theory in the heisenberg picture

in the heisenberg picture the lagrangian (5) is not split into its free and interacting
parts, in contradistinction to the interaction picture approach. instead, we derive
via variational principle, the coupled equations of motion of the interacting elds 
and a. in this section we shall be concerned with perturbative solutions of these
equations.

in order to consider the vacuum polarization, which will be done with details
in the next section, it is convenient to add to the lagrangian a term eaext
 ,
corresponding to an applied external eld. so, we obtain the following equations of
motion

(i/  m)(x) = e{a/(x) + a/ext(x)}(x) ;
(cid:16) + m 2(cid:17) a(x) +  

  1! {a(x)} = j(x) ,

with

j(x) = e(x)(x) .

(9)

(10)

(11)

these equations can be put into an integral form by the standard method of

greens functions:

(x) = (in)(x) +z d3ysr(x  y)e(a/(y) + a/ext(y))(y) ;

a(x) = a(in)

 (x) z d3ydr(x  y)j(y) ,

(12)

(13)

where (in)(x) and a(in)
 (x) are solutions of the free equations of motion and satisfy
the well known free eld (anti)commutation relations. sr(x) and dr(x) are the
retarded greens functions. for later use, we explicit the form of sr(x) and also the
advanced function sa(x):

sr(x) =

sa(x) =

1

(2)3 z d3p(p/ + m)(pv
(2)3 z d3p(p/ + m)(pv

m2  p2 + isgn(p0)(m2  p2)) eipx; (14)
m2  p2  isgn(p0)(m2  p2)) eipx. (15)

1

5

the equations (12) and (13) can be solved by iteration, so that we can write the
elds (x) and a(x) as expansions in powers of the coupling constant e (and the
external eld aext

 (x)). thus

(x) = (in)(x) + ez d3ysr(x  y)(a/(in)(y) + a/ext(y))(in)(y) +    ; (16)

a(x) = a(in)

 (x) + ez d3ydr(x  y)

(in)

(y)(in)(y) +    .

taking the adjoint of (16) we get

(x) = 

(in)

(x) + ez d3y

(in)

(y)(a/(in)(y) + a/ext(y))sa(y  x) +    .

(17)

(18)

in order to eliminate the zero-point charge we renormalize the current by re-

dening it as

j(x) = 

e
2

[(x), (x)] ,

(19)

where [, ] = 
[, ] (this could be done from the very beginning by the
appropriate symmetrization of the operator lagrangian [14]). then, substituting
the expansion (16) into this expression we have

(x), sr(x  y)(in)(y)]

(y) + aext

 (y)o +    .

j(x) = 

e

e2

(in)

(in)

2 z d3y(cid:26)[
(x), (in)(x)] 
(y)sa(y  x), (in)(x)](cid:27)na(in)



taking the vacuum expectation value of this current we obtain

with

where

h0|j(x)|0i = z d3y (x  y)aext

 (y) ,

(x  y) = 

e2

 (x  y) = h0| [

 (x)] |0i

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

=

1

(2)2 z d3p eip(xy)(p/ + m)(p2  m2) .

as we see, a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the current is induced
only if an external eld is applied. then, the vacuum behaves like a polarizable
medium and the kernel (x  y) is the vacuum polarization tensor, considered in
that follows.

6

4 the vacuum polarization tensor

now we shall be concerned with the calculation of . after substituting (14), (15)
and (23) into (22) we obtain its fourier transform

(k) = 

e2

2(2)2 z d3p1d3p2 (k  p1 + p2)

 tr{(p/1 + m)(p/2 + m)}h+(p1, p2) + (p1, p2)i ,

where

+(p1, p2)

def= (m2  p2

2)(pv

1

m2  p2

1

+ isgn(p0

1)(m2  p2

1)) ;

(24)

(25)

(p1, p2)

def= (m2  p2

1)(pv

1

m2  p2

2  isgn(p0

2)(m2  p2

2)) .

performing the trace and p2 integration in (24) we obtain

(k) = 

e2

(2)2 z d3p1np

1 (p1  k) + p

1(p1  k) + g(m2  p2

1 + p1  k)

+ imkoh+(p1, p1  k) + (p1, p1  k)i .

(26)

now, by using the gauge invariance of the model and lorentz covariance, we

expect that the vacuum polarization tensor can be written in the form

(k) =  g 

kk

k2 ! (1)(k2) + imk(2)(k2) ,

with the form factors given by

(1)(k2) =

1
2



(k) ;

(2)(k2) = 

i

2m



k
k2 (k) .

(27)

(28)

(29)

thus, the next step would be turned equation (26) into (28) and (29). however,
we must be careful because the integral in (26) is a divergent one. so, it needs to
be regularized. here we will adopt pauli-villars (pv) regularization, that preserves
gauge invariance and it is simple to implement in the context of heisenberg picture.

then the regularized vacuum polarization tensor is

7



reg(k) =

ci (k, mi) ,

(30)

n

xi=0

where (k, mi) is the expression (26) with m replaced by mi and n is the number
of auxiliary spinors elds sucient to remove the divergences. for this purpose the
coecients cis must satisfy the consistency conditions:

ci = 0 ;

cimi = 0 ,

n

xi=0

n

xi=0

(31)

with c0 = 1 and m0 = m. by analysing (26) we see that to remove the diver-
gences of the vacuum polarization tensor we need just two regulator elds, so that
henceforward we will take cj = 0 for all j > 2.

then, considering 

reg, it is possible to consider separately the form factors
according to (28) and (29) (which are the symmetric and antisymmertic parts of
vacuum polarization, respectively). firstly we shall consider the antisymmetric part
because this is related with the topological mass and it is here that the regularization
controversy emerges. for pratical pourposes we will split (2)
reg(k2) in its real and
imaginary parts

reg(k2) = e (2)
(2)

reg(k2) + i m (2)

reg(k2) ,

where

e (2)

reg(k2) =

(34)

 nsgn(p0)  sgn(p0  k0)o .

for nave power counting these integrals are nite, so we would expect that the
result to the form factor (2) would be independent of the regularization scheme.
nevertheless, it is well known that there is a regularization ambiguity related to
this term [4, 11]. in particular, it is generally accepted that pv regularization gives
no mass correction, in contradistinction to analytic [15] and dimensional [11] ones.
this happens because in the pv scheme the eect of regulator fermionic masses

8

remains nite even after we take the limit of these regulators going to innity (the
result depend on the masses signals). however, it is possible to make a specic
choice of the regulators such that the nite integrals remains unaected by the pv
regularization [13].

let us now see how this works. the real part of (2)

reg can be written, by using

well known representations for the principal value and delta function [14], as

e (2)

reg(k2) =

the x integral can be performed by mean of the usual fourier transform of the

(37)

these integrals can be solved by standard techniques and results

(38)

now, taking the masses of the regulator elds going to innity we get

and it is easy to show that with the choice c1 = c2 =  1
so that the term in the square brackets in (39) cancels and we obtain

e (2)

reg(k2)  e (2)(k2) =

e2

4k2

the calculation of the imaginary part, equation (34), is straightforward and one

obtains

m (2)

reg(k2)  m (2)(k2) =

sgn(k0)(k2  4m2) .

(41)

9

from (40) and (41) we obtain that the coecient of antisymmetric part at zero
momentum is given by

m(2)(0) = 

e2
4

,

(42)

which by the coleman-hill theorem [17] is the exact value for the topological mass,
since the higher order contributions to vacuum polarization tensor do not contribute
to this term. then, we see that by an appropriate choice of regulator parameters
the pv regularization results in the same value for (2)(0) that analytic [15] and
dimensional [11] ones.

turning now to the symmetric form factor, equation (28), we can also split it in

its real and imaginary parts as

reg(k2) = e (1)
(1)

reg(k2) + i m (1)

reg(k2) ,

the calculation of these expressions follows along the same lines outlined above for
the antisymmetric part (with minor modications), so we just write down the result
for the complete (1)

from which we obtain

5 corrected gauge boson propagator

now we can obtain the gauge boson propagator corrected by vacuum polarization
insertions to one loop, which enable us to account the subjects of dynamical mass
generation and generation of dynamics in the qed3 and tmgt limits, respectively.

the corrected gauge boson propagator is given by

to perform the inversions above it is convenient to introduce the complete set

(50)

(51)

to make the inversion of the propagator we just write it using these projectors

and invert the respective coecients. so, we have

(d

(52)

substituting these expressions into (48) and inverting again, we nally obtain

the corrected propagator

(54)

11

from equation (53) we see that the corrected gauge boson propagator acquires
an antisymmetric parity-violating part correspondent to the induction of a cs term.
it must be observed that this expression has a well dened limit as m  0, but in
this case we do not have a cs term.
let us now to analyse some limits of (53). first, let us make   , when the
lagrangian (5) goes to the tmgt lagrangian. this limit is easily performed in
(53)-(54) and we can observe that a pole is generated in the corrected propagator
(note that the free propagator, equation (49), does not have a pole in the same
limit). this indicates that the gauge boson of tmgt becomes dynamical due to
radiative corrections [3, 4, 7].

another limit of interest is given by taking   1 and the gauge boson mass
vanishing m  0 (i.e., the strong thirring coupling constant limit g  ). in this
limit the matter sector of the gauged thirring model goes to qed3. after taking
this limit (53) can be written in the form

(55)

(56)

the propagator (55) has the same form as that obtained in ref. [11]. then, the
behaviour of (0) dictates whether a mass for the gauge boson is generated or not.
on the other hand, as (1)(0) = 0 (equation (47)), we see by (56) that this question
depends exclusively on the behaviour of (2)(0). the usual treatments using pauli-
villars regularization give (2)(0) = 0, so that the gauge boson remains massless.
however, with the choice adopted for the cis we get (2)(0) 6= 0 (see equation (42))
and so the gauge boson of qed3 acquires a mass, in accordance with the results
obtained by using dimensional [11] or analytic [15] regularization or the epstein and
glaser causal method [18].

6 concluding remarks

in the framework of the heisenberg picture we have calculated the vacuum polar-
ization tensor in the (2+1)-dimensional gauged thirring model by using the pauli-
villars regularization. by an appropriate choice of the regulators [13] we were able
to obtain a nonvanishing value for the coecient of the induced chern-simons term
(topological mass), which is in accordance with the result obtained by others regu-
larization schemes [11, 15]. we must stress that the choice of the regulators which

12

we have made does not modify the nite parts of the amplitude, a highly desirable
feature in a regularization. in this sense that choice is the most natural one [13].

by considering the corrected gauge boson propagator and taking the limit
  , when the gauged thirring model goes to the tmgt, we have reproduced
the results obtained working with the tmgt lagrangian from the very beginning
[7]. thus, we see that the gauge boson of this model becomes dynamical by radiative
corrections. in the limit of strong thirring coupling constant m  0 (with  = 1)
the gauged thirring model goes to the qed3. then, from the corrected propagator
we see that the photon becomes massive due to the nonvanishing value of (2)(0)
[11].

in special, this example is very interesting since the gauged thirring model com-
prises theories as distincts as qed3 (superrenormalizable) and the thirring model
as a gauge theory (nonrenormalizable) as limits. work considering the complete one
loop treatment of this model (both for one and n fermion avors) are in progress.
