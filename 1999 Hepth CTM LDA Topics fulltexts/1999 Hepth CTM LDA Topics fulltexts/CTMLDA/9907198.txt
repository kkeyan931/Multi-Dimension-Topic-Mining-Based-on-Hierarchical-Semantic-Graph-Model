(8) (9) (10) now, interesting, us important, notice eq. (5) (rewritten frw case) eq. (7) seen eulerlagrange equations point lagrangian l = 6a a2f () + 6 a2f () + a3(p + pm) , (11) eq.

(negative values f () necessary disregard repulsive gravity.) then, eq. (14) inserted eq. (12) gives v () = hv0k0 p(s)i 2p(s) .

(16), (17), (18), (19) yields a( ) = (cid:18)2 + 3 (cid:19)4/ 2(22+9+6) 3(2+6+8) , ( ) = (cid:18)2 + 3 (cid:19)3/(2+) 2/(2+) . (25) (26) hand, eq.

(27) (28) thus, clear always w > 1. constant , i.e. constant potential (which mimics cosmological constant term), get w = 1. general 2 2v = /2 k0 2v0 x 2 > 0 , k0 /2 > 0 , implying constraint always true. (29) (30) one main requests scalar eld satisfy, order seen good tracker eld, 2 < v (), i.e. x < 1. requiring 0 < x < 1 poses condition 0 < k0 /2 < 27v0 2(2 + ) . (31) course, 0 < x < 1 also implies w < 0, 1 < w < 0, namely needed scalar eld interpreted quintessence. recently, claimed constraints largescale structure together snia data imply w < 0.6 95% condence level , forces eld variation x this, turn, yields 0 < x < 0.25 . 0 < k0 /2 < 27v0 8(2 + ) . (32) (33) constraints given eq. (31) also consistent direct calculation w eq. (10). matter fact, inserting expression eq. (26) ( ), get 10 w = 2k0 2k0 /2(2 + ) 27v0 /2(2 + ) + 27v0 . (34) is, w < 0 implies eq. (31). restriction found values s, already eq. (23) holds, one looks equipartition end ination inverse powerlaw potentials. this, even, constrains > 5 , 3 2 < < 21 16 . (35) , minimal coupling regime, also introduced two important equations, equation motion tracker equation. matter fact, rst one easily generalized nonminimal coupling situation, giving v v = 3vuut (1 + w) "1 + 1 6 ln x ln + 2f h (cid:16)2h 2 + h(cid:17)# , (36) 8g/3 (we changing units following current litereture), /h 2, f = 2k0. (the signs, respectively, depend whether v > 0 v < 0.) f = 0 gives minimal coupling case, cosmological solutions converge tracking solution, w nearly constant less wb (where b indicates background), implying 1 + w = o(1) therefore 2 h 2 = , v v h . 1 q (37) referred tracker equation . also introduce function v v /(v )2, used  test tracker behavior. let us notice, then, times v v (v )2 = 2p(s) 1 2p(s) = 1 + 1 = const. , (38) major condition tracker behavior. > 1 interval eq.

(41) hand, nearly constant, eq. (41) minimal coupling regime implies  solution exists w also nearly constant x, x, x become nearly zero. also leads eq. (41). eq. (38), relation eq.

(33), 2 + 54 < v0 < 2 + 27 4(2 + ) 135 < v0 < 2 + 27 . also, substituting eq. (44) directly eq. (31) eq. (33), respectively, gives or, equivalently, wb < 2 , wb < 4 3 5 < 2 wb , < 4 5wb + 3 . (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) let us notice, then, second relation eq. (48) always implies wb < 0 (which good ordinary matter), rst relation eq. (48) gives right constraint wb < 1. also, second relation eq. (49) yields < 4/3 dust (wb = 0) < 1/2 13 sti matter (wb = 1), rst relation eq. (49) lets us accept value dust, gives < 6 radiation (wb = 1/3) < 2 sti matter. finally, say considerations seem imply eq. (32) limits much variability x. let us also notice eq.

(50) now, ordinary matter (i.e., 0 wb 1), comes (always disregarding approximated equality) 2 2 + |w| 2 2 + , (51) implying (for = 2) 0 w 1/2, (for = 4) 0 < |w| 1/3, instance. < means, then, values w 0.6 however possible, even considerations made let us understand may also values w 0.6 < w < 0. course, kinds considerations taken indicative, since eq. (41) always valid usually read one way: assign specic value wb, gives approximated value w. example, wb = 0 gives w 2/(2 + ) < 0 > 0, wb = 1/3 found w ( 6)/ (giving critical value = 6, > 6 implies positive w > 6 implies negative w). hand, anyway, taking tracker condition eq. (37) account, immediately control validity, v v = 1+w 1+wb 1 , h 1+w 1+wb 1 . (52) (53) global consequence, assert (26) good family exact tracker solutions, parametrized constants v0 k0, 4+ v0k/2 0 . 14 (54) consider relations eq.
