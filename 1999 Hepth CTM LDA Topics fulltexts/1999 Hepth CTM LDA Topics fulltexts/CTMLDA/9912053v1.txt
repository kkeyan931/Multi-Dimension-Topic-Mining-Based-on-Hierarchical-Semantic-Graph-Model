abstract: the supersymmetric ow equations describing the ow of moduli from
innity to the black hole horizon, and vice versa, are derived in the ve-dimensional
theories where the moduli space of the very special geometry has disjoint branches.
the multiple solutions are derived from the o the horizon attractor equation.
within each branch, the black hole entropy, as usual, depends only on the near
the entropy depends on the charges and
horizon attractor values of moduli, i.e.
on coecients of the cubic polynomial.
it does not depend on the values of the
moduli elds at innity. however, the entropy, as well as the near horizon values
of the moduli elds, are shown to depend on the choice of the branch specied by
the choice of the set of moduli at innity. we present examples of bps black hole
solutions with the same qi and cijk, whose entropies dier signicantly.

1. during the last decade supersymmetric black holes played an important role
in setting up the issues of the fundamental theory, including gravity. for example,
an important property of the supersymmetric black holes is the manifest symmetry
under u-duality transformations. the explanation of this fact from the point of view
of type iia string theory requires rst to promote it to an 11-dimensional theory and
afterwards to compactify it on a torus. not much is known about 11-dimensional
m theory, but the existence of u-duality invariant bps states, like supersymmetric
black holes, helps to explore the non-perturbative string/m-theory.

the purpose of this note is to present some new, previously unexplored features
of supersymmetric black hole entropy:
its non-uniqueness in theories with disjoint
branches of the moduli space. the existence of multiple critical points relevant to
bps black holes in the theories with the same electric charges but disjoint branches
of moduli space was already established before [1].

the issue of the non-uniqueness of the supersymmetric black hole entropy was
raised in [2] in the context of black holes of calabi-yau spaces. here we consider
arbitrary d=5, n=2 supergravity theory [3], the moduli space is not symmetric, in
general. we put no restrictions on chern-simons couplings cijk: the supersymmetry
is valid for all these generic theories. in some cases they may be interpreted as calabi-
yau intersection numbers. the uniqueness of the entropy in the theories where the
moduli space has only one branch with the positive metric to large extent follows from
the fact, established in [4], that the entropy is a minimum of the bps mass.1 the
existence of disjoint branches of the moduli space of ve-dimensional supergravity
[3] was rst pointed out in [6].

in the context of gauged supergravity the disjoint branches of moduli space were
studied in [7, 1]. an important feature of these branches is that not only the metric
of scalar elds [7] but also the metric of vector elds is positive-denite [1], which
means that these branches are quite legitimate. in particular, we have found dierent
ads5 branches with equal values of the cosmological constant, which is one of the
necessary conditions for realization of a supersymmetric generalization of the one-
brane randall-sundrum scenario [8]. however, we were able to show (see also [7])
that all interpolating domain wall solutions (not only bps states) in a broad class
of supersymmetric models studied in [1] are not of the randall-sundrum type.

in this paper we will present the complete black hole solutions, i.e. dene the
moduli and the metric and the vector elds of the black holes everywhere, not only
at the critical point near the horizon. there will be at least two solutions depending
on the same harmonic functions, one with the central charge z positive and the other
with the central charge z negative. this will explain the multivalued nature of the
black hole entropy.

1recently a detailed derivation of the uniqueness of the bps black hole entropy was performed
in [5]. the claim was also made that the entropy is always unique. the argument, however, is
based on an assumption that the moduli space consists of a single branch.

we study the ve dimensional n=2 ungauged supergravity interacting with n
abelian vector multiplets [3, 9]. the supersymmetric black hole solutions of this
theory in the context of the very special geometry were studied in [10, 11]. a general
ansatz for the black hole solution with positive central charge z was proposed in [12].
the ansatz is given in terms of n+1 harmonic functions, ki = ki +qi/r2. it provides
an explicit black hole solution only in cases when the solution of the stabilization-
type equations cijky j y k = ki is available. stabilization equations in general
are known to dene the values of the moduli near the black hole horizon [13, 14].
the specic form of stabilization equations in n=2 d=5 supergravity interacting with
vector multiplets, cijky j y k = qi, was found in [11]. it gives the values of the xed
scalars near the horizon. an analogous equation is also a part of the stabilization
equations in d=4 n=2 theory with a cubic prepotential [15] relevant to calabi-yau
black holes.

we will present below an ansatz for the black hole solutions with both positive
and negative central charges z = x i()qi. the surprising feature of it is that
sometimes both solutions with positive and negative central charges (graviphoton
charges) occur for the same choice of harmonic functions and in particular for the
same individual vector elds charges qi.

the reason why it is surprising to have a central charge, i.e. the graviphoton
charge, both positive and negative for the same charges of the vector elds qi is the
following. the graviphoton charge is given by the moduli dependent combination
z = x i()qi of the individual vector elds charges qi.
if there are no vector
multiplets and i = 0, the graviphoton charge is equal to the usual charge z = q0.
the central charge is positive for positive q0 and negative for negative q0. in the
rst case we have m = z, in the second case m = z. in presence of moduli, as
shown in [1] it is possible to have both values of z without changing the sign of qi.
after having observed this unusual situation near the critical point we would like to
show the full solution with such properties.

2. the very special geometry of ve-dimensional supergravity emerges because
the independent moduli i, i = 1, . . . , n are coordinates describing some cubic hy-
persurface

and the moduli x i() are real and have to satisfy the o the horizon attractor
equation

e2u cijkx jx k = ki .

(11)

the ansatz with the upper sign is the one found by sabra [12]. the appearance of
the second solution with the minus sign for the same choice of the harmonic function
is new since we are not changing ki to ki. it is clear from eq. (9) that e2u must
be everywhere positive since it is a component of the space-time metric. still the

3

combination x iki can be either positive or negative: only in such cases our ansatz
gives a consistent solution. both cases may exist as we will see soon.

near the black hole horizon our o the horizon attractor equation (11) reduces

to the near horizon attractor equation

the form

in this form it was studied extensively in [11] and, for the multivalued central

cijk x i

(13)

charge z, in [1].

the multivalued nature of the black hole entropy was discussed in [1] on the
basis of the near horizon attractor equation (13). at least 2 dierent solutions may
exist: one with positive z and another one with negative z. the elds x i may be
real and imaginary, in what follows we will denote them by y i
im, respectively.

(14)

in the rst case the redened eld is real, in the second case it is imaginary. however,
the moduli x i in both cases is real. the near horizon equations take the form

cijky j

rey k

re = qi ,

cijky j

im = qi .

(15)

even more solutions may exist in many-moduli case, particularly if the stabi-
lization equations (13 have more solutions for which the metric of the moduli space
and the one for the vector space are positive-denite. we will see now how all of this
generalizes for the full black hole solution. first we redene the elds in eq. (11).

we introduce e2u x i = x i(r). in terms of these variables the o the horizon

attractor equation takes the form:

cijk x j(r) x k(r) = ki(r) .

introduce

+e2u x i = y i

re(r) ,

the o the horizon attractor equations take the form

re (r) = ki(r) ,

im(r) = ki(r) .

(16)

(17)

(18)

here again we will be looking for the solutions of the stabilization equations
with both real and imaginary y i which correspond to real x i. note that after

4

re(r) and y i

the eld redenition the o the horizon equations (18) look exactly as the near
horizon equations (15) but now the moduli y (r) are dened by its solutions via ki(r)
everywhere at all values of r and not only at r = 0. still the solutions of the attractor
equations for y i
im(r) in terms of the harmonic functions ki(r) are precisely
the same as in the near horizon cases the solutions for y i
im(r = 0)
in terms of the constants qi. this means that in all cases when these equations
near horizon were solved (or will be solved eventually), and multiple solutions are
available near the horizon, the multivalued black hole solution are obtained simply
by replacing the constants qi with the harmonic functions ki(r).
in particular,
using examples of solutions with both real and imaginary values of y i(r = 0) given
in [1], we will nd below the full black hole solutions with both real and imaginary
y i(r) and two values of real x i(r).

re(r = 0) and y i

thus, to nd the black hole solutions in these theories one should explicitly solve
the algebraic attractor equations. the metric will be obtained straightforwardly from
such solutions.

there is an interesting property of our attractor equations at r  . since the
parameters of the solutions are given by harmonic functions hi the values of moduli
at r   are not free: rather we have to solve the stabilization equation at r  
to nd the values of the moduli there.

(19)

there is a restriction on the choice of ki for a given cijk such that for both solutions

e2u

(x i

r) ki = 1 .

(20)

the double extreme black holes are the ones with constant moduli. to nd
such we may choose ki = qi and all harmonic functions will have the factorizable
dependence on r of the form ki = ki(1 + /r2). the moduli elds if chosen e. g. as
the ratio of x i/x 0 will be r-independent for such solutions and the metric will be
e2u = (1 + /r2). we will nd examples of such double-extreme black holes which
live in the two dierent branches of the moduli space. the values of moduli will be
dierent in two branches, but the metric and therefore the entropy will be the same.
for the black hole solutions with non-constant moduli, the value of the metric
at innity dened by the choice of hi will be the same. however at the horizon the
metric in two dierent branches of the moduli space and, consequently, the black
hole entropy, can be signicantly dierent.

3. the theory with one independent moduli is relatively easy to understand. it
may give some insights into the properties of the black holes in more general and more
interesting cases with many moduli, in particular, related to calabi-yau spaces. the
positive deniteness of the moduli space metric and the gauge couplings has been

5

analyzed in one-moduli case in [1]. in more general situations this will be a more
complicated problem.

consider a simple case of i = 1, 2 and generic cijk and hi = 1

2ki. according
to the discussions above, we have to take our solutions of the near horizon attractor
equations in [1] and replace the charges there by the harmonic functions ki(r) to get
the full metric. it gives for the two cases of y i
im the solutions for the metric
and for the moduli   x 2

we assume that l2  4mn < 0 and m > 0, n > 0 so that the metric of the moduli
space is positive. the metric, however, may have singularities which show that the
moduli space dened by the constrained surface v = 1 has disjoint branches: the
multivalued black hole solutions exist in each separate branch of the moduli space.
the study of the vector space metric (gauge couplings) for the black holes dened

that it is positive.

(30)

for arbitrary choice of harmonic functions the values of x iki for two solutions
(with yre and yim) are dierent. but at r   the metric has to be the same,
e2u
r = 1. fortunately, solutions of such type have been found in [1]. one has to
require, therefore, that by solving the attractor equations at innity (19) one gets
the same value of x iki in case of yre and yim. the equation for our parameters
specifying this case is:

a  k2(dk2

2  2ck1h2) + d(k)"f (k)l + 2e(k)m
(l2  4mn)

# = 0 .

(31)

in [1] we have found several families of such solutions of the stabilization equations.

we will use these examples to satisfy the condition (cid:16)e2u(cid:17)p/m

= 1 at r  .

4. to show that the analytic solutions for the multivalued black holes have non-
trivial examples and to understand the properties of such solutions, we plot some of
them for a particular choice of cijk. as the purpose of this paper is to promote the
multiple critical points of our attractor systems to complete black hole solutions, we
will use the same one-moduli theory with a = 0, b = 1/3, c = 4/3, d = 1 which
we used in [1] and where we checked that the physical conditions of the positivity of
the moduli space metric and of the gauge coupling matrix are satised. in this case
the moduli space metric is singular at  = 0,   0.27,   3.73. it is positive
everywhere but discontinuous. therefore the expectation is that if the moduli at
innity starts in one of the branches, it will ow to the black hole horizon remaining
in the same stripe of the moduli space, so that at all r the black hole moduli (r)
is inside of a given branch where it started and the metric gtt is smooth all the way
from innity to the horizon. this indeed is a property of our solutions. we plot some
examples of multivalued black hole solutions and their entropy. in all our examples
we take k1 = 2, k2 = 4. these provide the correct asymptotic behavior of the metric
e2u  1 and keep the initial values of moduli in two disconnected branches of the
moduli space: the rst one in the branch 0 <  < + and the second one in the
branch 0.27 <  < 0. in all examples we will plot the moduli (r) and the space-
time metric. we also plot the metric gtt(r) = e4u (r); this function tends to 0 near
the horizon at r = 0 and tends to 1 at r  . to nd the entropy we plot for each
example the value of r3e3u (r) = |zhor/6|3/2(r) = | zhor|3/2(r) near the horizon. the
black hole entropy is proportional to | zhor|3/2(0).

7

it is useful to start with the double extreme black holes: for them the moduli
does not change, so it denitely stays in the same branch where it started. we
make here the simplest choice of harmonic functions ki = ki(1 + 1/r2) with k1 = 2,
k2 = 4. the plot of moduli  in figure 1 shows that one of them remains equal to
+1 everywhere and the other one remains equal to 0.2. in figure 1 we also show
the metric: we nd that gtt, is the same for both solutions, as follows from analytic
expression for the double extreme black holes. the entropy is also the same for these
two solutions.

the second example which we plot in figure 2 is for a choice k1 = 2, k2 =
4, q1 = 0.49, q2 = 1.8275. this particular choice of charges was taken simply to
show that one can nd a solution with the entropies near the horizon of each black
hole dierent 103 times.
in figure 2 we plot the two ows of moduli, each in its
branch of the moduli space. to show that both solutions are nice and smooth, we
plot gtt(r))p/m = (e4u (r))p/m on two dierent scales: one shows that both metrics
at innity approach 1, the second is closer to the horizon. we also plot the entropy.
we have to make two dierent plots, since the rst one diers from the second one
103 times. we have plotted many other examples with simple values of charges, like
1, 3, 5 etc. in such cases we found the entropies in two branches dier moderately,
like 2 or 10 times.

thus we have studied supersymmetric black holes in d=5, n=2 supergravity in
cases when the moduli space may have disjoint branches with everywhere positive
metric. we have found black hole solutions in each branch which are dierent despite
the black hole charges and the cubic surface dening a supergravity theory are the
same. the new supersymmetric black hole entropy formula is

s = s(qi, cijk, nl) ,

(32)

where the dependence on nl with l = 1 . . . , k indicates the dependence on the branch
of the moduli space in case there are k branches. it would be interesting to nd the
multivalued black hole solutions for some parameters which may appear within a
context of string/m-theory.

it remains to nd out whether this observation of the unusual properties of
supergravity black holes can be used to probe the properties of the fundamental
theory.
