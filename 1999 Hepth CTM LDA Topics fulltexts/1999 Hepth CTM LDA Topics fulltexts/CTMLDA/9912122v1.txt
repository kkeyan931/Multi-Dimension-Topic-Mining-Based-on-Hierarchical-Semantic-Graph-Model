abstract

i discuss the idea that quantum irreversibility is a general principle of nature and a re-
lated conformal hypothesis, stating that all fundamental quantum eld theories should
be renormalization-group (rg) interpolations between ultraviolet and infrared conformal

xed points. in particular, the newton constant should be viewed as a low-energy eect
of the rg scale . this approach leads naturally to consider higher-spin conformal eld
theories, which are here classied, as candidate high-energy theories. bosonic conformal
tensors have a positive-denite action, equal to the square of a eld strength, and a higher-
derivative gauge invariance. the central charges c and a are well dened and positive. i

calculate their values and study the operator-product structure. fermionic theories have no
gauge invariance and can be coupled to abelian and non-abelian gauge elds in a renormal-
izable way. at the quantum level, they contribute to the one-loop beta function with the
same sign as ordinary matter, admit a conformal window and non-trivial interacting xed
points. the propagation of the ghost degrees of freedom is visible through the existence

of composite operators of high spin and low dimension, violating the ferraragattogrillo
theorem. these ghosts might disappear above the planck length, thanks to the irreversibil-
ity of the rg ow, the nachtmann theorem or equivalent mechanisms. there might also be
applications to the nuclear physics of hadronic resonances. other theories, such as confor-
mal antisymmetric tensors and higher-derivative theories, are shown to be less promising,

because of more severe internal problems.

1 statement of the problem

in the approach to quantum eld theory as a radiative interpolation between pairs of xed
points (see [1] for a brief survey) a natural question is the denition of the central charges c
and a for higher-spin elds, in particular gravity. in conformal eld theory, c and a are dened
by the trace anomaly in external gravity. the quantity c multiplies the square of the weyl
tensor w 2
 and is the coecient of the two-point function of the stress tensor. the quantity
a multiplies the euler density g4 = rr. a third term, r, is multiplied by
a coecient a:

ar(cid:21) .

two orders of problems arise when attempting to dene c and a for gravity. first, gravity
cannot be embedded in external gravity in a non-trivial way. more importantly, the theory
is not conformal at the classical level. in particular, the massless spin-2 free-eld theory is not
a conformal eld theory and we cannot formulate a radiative interpolation between pairs of
conformal xed points if the infrared (ir) limit contains a spin-2 free eld, no matter what the
denition of gravity at high energies is. this is a bit uncomfortable, since it forbids a unied
description of all interactions in the approach of [1]. that approach can be generalized by the
following conformal hypothesis:

every quantum eld theory describing the phenomena of nature should be a renormalization-
group (rg) interpolation between a ultraviolet (uv) conformal eld theory and an ir conformal
eld theory.

by rg ow i mean the ow induced by the dynamical scale . this means that not only
should the theory have well-dened conformal uv and ir limits, but it should also be conformal
as a classical theory, which implies it being strictly renormalizable at the quantum level. these
are the theories considered in [2, 3], for which a general formula for the irreversibility of a holds.
the conformal hypothesis is the assumption that all the fundamental theories of nature are of
this type.

in some sense, the conformal hypothesis puts a restriction on the correspondence principle:
the fundamental theories of nature should be obtained by the quantization of classically con-
formal eld theories. here i discuss the plausibility of the conformal hypothesis as a general
principle of physics, both in its strong form (no dimensionful parameter is fundamental; all
dimensionful parameters should descend from  in some way) and in some weaker forms (new-
tons constant and, eventually, other non-renormalizable parameters, descend from , as well
as qcd, but there might be fundamental super-renormalizable parameters and masses).

these ideas are suggested to me by our present knowledge of low-energy qcd [4]. if the
quarks are massless, the masses of hadrons are proportional to qcd and therefore descend
from : massless qcd obeys the conformal hypothesis in its strong form. the pion masses
and corrections to hadron masses are due to the quark masses. therefore massive qcd obeys
the conformal hypothesis in its weak form. the strong conformal hypothesis might explain the
pion masses in a more fundamental theory, but not in qcd. massless qcd is the prototype

2

of perfect theory from the point of view of the conformal hypothesis. it is tempting to think
that the ultimate theory of the world is of the same type. theories not obeying the (strong or
weak) conformal hypothesis should be viewed as low-energy eective theories descending from
high-energy fundamental theories obeying the conformal hypothesis.

a rst question is: how can we describe gravity without violating the conformal principle?
it is conceivable that a non-vanishing cosmological constant can make the graviton disappear
in the far ir limit, which would be consistent with the conformal hypothesis. more dicult is
to say what gravity should look like at high energies if the conformal hypothesis is true.

the conformal hypothesis is naturally suggested by the idea that quantum irreversibility,
i.e. the statement that a decreases along the rg ow, in particular auv  air, is equal to
the (scheme-invariant) area of the graph of the beta function between the xed points [2], is a
fundamental principle of nature. if this idea is correct, gravity should obey the irreversibility
principle.

the question is theoretically relevant for the following reason. because of the irreversible
loss of degrees of freedom along the rg ow, it is natural to expect that the formulation of quan-
tum eld theory starting from its low-energy limit might nd major obstacles, in perturbation
theory. think, for example, of a free massive scalar eld, with lagrangian l = 1
2 [()2 +m22]:
its far ir limit (m  ) is the empty theory. the theory cannot be recovered unambiguously
from the empty theory. in the uv limit, instead, we have a free eld and the low-energy limit
can be reached with a 2-perturbation. similar considerations apply to rg ows, because the
irreversibility of an rg ow is qualitatively (but not quantitatively) similar to the irreversibil-
ity of a massive ow.
in conclusion, a perturbative formulation of quantum eld theory is
meaningful only from the uv.

concretely, this idea implies that, in qed, problems of the type of the landau poles are
not removable; actually they are the sign that the theory is formulated from the wrong limit,
or that it is the low-energy eective limit of a more fundamental theory. the triviality of
4 might have a similar explanation. similarly, the relationship between a) qcd expressed
in its natural high-energy variables (quarks and gluons) and b) qcd expressed in its natural
low-energy variables (hadrons)  would not be a well-dened change of variables:
it would
not be invertible. we understand that it is very important to answer the question of whether
quantum irreversibility is a fundamental principle of nature or a coincidence.

naively, however, it is tempting to think that gravity, and actually every non-renormalizable
interaction, violates the irreversibility principle, because a coupling constant with negative
dimension in units of mass kills degrees of freedom in the uv and leaves the ir unchanged.
this eect is in some sense dual to the eect of masses or, in general, super-renormalizable
terms, where degrees of freedom are killed in the ir and the uv is left unchanged. the
intermediate case, a classically conformal theory owing only due to the rg scale , is less
trivial, but much more interesting; and it does obey the irreversibility property [2].

in [5] it was shown that above two dimensions the behaviour of a is, at the quantitative level,
sensitive to the dimensionality of parameters (marginal, relevant, irrelevant deformations). in
particular, strictly renormalizable interactions cannot be assimilated to super-renormalizable

3

interactions (in which i include the mass terms), although they are qualitatively similar. only
in two dimensions, or when c = a in higher even dimensions, can we disregard this dierence.
i stress that this fact does not contradict, or restrict, the irreversibility statement, which is a
statement about the irreversibility of the rg ow, i.e. the ow induced by the rg scale  (see
introduction of [2]), not a generic phenomenon of decreasing of a and the degrees of freedom.
a dependence on the dimensionality of the parameters is natural:
it would be upsetting if 
behaved as an ordinary scale.

in summary, we have the following four situations:
1) classically conformal theories, where the ow is due only to  at the quantum level;
there is no explicit dimensionful parameter and  does not become real (for example, in the
form of the expectation value of a condensate) at low energies. examples are the theories of
the conformal window.

2) classically conformal theories having an explicit dimensionful parameter at low energies.
an example is massless qcd, and the dimensionful constant is qcd. however, qcd is just
the scale , which has come to reality, at low energies, owing to the mechanism of chiral-
symmetry breaking and dimensional transmutation. we have

qcd =  exp z ()

d

qcd()! .

this case can be assimilated to (1) from the point of view of quantum irreversibility. the
formula expressing the dierence auv  air [2] as the invariant area of the graph of the beta
function between the two xed holds in this case.

3) massive terms and super-renormalizable interactions. they obey the inequality auv 
air, but the actual value of auvair is measured dierently [5]. these cases can be assimilated
to cases (1) and (2) at the quantitative level when c = a [5].

4) non-renormalizable interactions and in particular the newton constant . this case

remains to be claried from the point of view of quantum irreversibility.

gravity will obey the irreversibility property if  itself is generated by the rg scale :

 =

exp z () d

g()! ,

as a low-energy eect of an unknown, classically conformal high-energy theory having beta
function g. this is one possible solution to our problem: if newtons constant descends from
, then it is constrained by the arguments of [2] to obey the irreversibility principle. the
graviton might be the analogue of the pion in massless qcd.

another wayout might be the following. we consider here the c = a ows, which means
ows connecting uv and ir xed points in such a way that the dierence ca remains constant
(not necessarily zero), in particular auv  air = cuv  cir. the xed points might or not have
c = a. for example, taking a direct product between a c = a ow connecting two c = a xed
points and a free-eld theory, we can obtain a c = a ow connecting c 6= a xed points.

4

in the c = a ows, dimensionless parameters can be assimilated to dimensionful coupling
constants, for example masses and, conceivably, also the newton constant [5]. this means that
the eects of divergences and their removal (running of the coupling constants, rg ow, etc.)
can be understood as a more common, geometrical phenomenon in disguise and that the
dynamical scale  can be interpreted classically as a mass, the inverse of a compactication
radius, or something similar. therefore in a c = a ow divergences are not really divergences,
and the rg ow is not really an rg ow. running coupling and divergences might be eects
of an unconvenient choice of variables. in the appropriate variables the theory might be truly
nite and  be a mass or the inverse of a compactication radius. when c 6= a, on the other
hand, it is very unlikely that an rg ow can be interpreted geometrically. it is anyway true that
a mass m behaves like  in the limit m  , a property used for example in the pauli-villars
regularization technique.

this motivates us to state that the concept of niteness in quantum eld theory should
be extended to include ows in which the divergences admit a classical interpretation, in
particular the c = a ows.

the relevance of these observations to our present problem are that in c = a ows it is
reasonable to expect that parameters of types (14) can all be assimilated and we do not need
to generate the dimensionful parameters of the low-energy theories via the rg scale . then
quantum irreversibility would still be a general principle and newtons constant would not need
to descend from .

we have proposed two possible solutions to our problem, that the newton constant descends
from  or that c is equal to a; but which proposal is more promising? in particular, is our world
c = a?

120 (ns + 6nf + 12nv), a = 1

it is very unlikely that the restriction c = a is phenomenologically viable. neither the
standard model, nor qcd have c = a. we can check it in the free-eld limits. we use the
conventional normalization c = 1
360 (ns + 11nf + 62nv) for free
eld theories of ns,f,v real scalars, dirac fermions and vectors, respectively. qed has nv = 1,
nf = 1 and therefore c = 3
360 . massless qcd has nv = 8, nf = 18
10 , a = 347
and therefore c = 17

ns = 4 and therefore c = 79

a necessary, but not sucient, condition for a c = a ow is obtained by comparing the
values of c and a at energies admitting (approximate) free-eld descriptions. the dierences
between the numbers of spin-0, 1/2, 1 elds at two such energies should be related by the
formula

2ns + 7nf = 26nv.

(1.2)

comparing the uv and ir limits of massless qcd, we nd ns = n2
nv = n 2

f + 1, nf = ncnf ,
c  1, where nc is the number of colors and nf is the number of quark avours. it

5

is easy to check that the condition has no solution. only for nc = 1 has nf a real value. this
means that our perfect theory is very far from c = a. similarly, the spectra of the known
low-energy physics do not appear to obey (1.2). for example, in the ir we can neglect the
electron, but we have to include it at energies comparable to its mass. formula (1.2) implies
that as soon as the electron, or other fermions, becomes important, vector elds should appear
also. there is no evidence of such a behavior in nature.

we are therefore led to concentrating on the rst solution to our problem: the newton
constant is not a fundamental parameter of nature, but a low-energy eect of the rg scale
 in an unknown high-energy formulation of quantum gravity. this is the rst, non-trivial
prediction of the conformal hypothesis.

we have already explained that, because of quantum irreversibility, it might be hopeless to
quantize gravity from its low-energy limit, i.e. the einstein theory. what can gravity look like
at very high energies, if the conformal hypothesis is true? i believe that, before investigating by
which mechanism to generate newtons constant out of the dynamical scale , it is necessary
to classify all conformal eld theories. this paper is devoted to the results of this investigation.
the theories formulated here have a positive-denite action and well-dened, positive central
charges c and a, which will be calculated for various cases.

higher-spin conformal eld theories have rather unusual properties, which is why i thought
that it was good to devote a considerable part of this introduction to stating the problem
and the ideas that inspired it. the theories propagate ghosts [6], but on the other hand have
a number of interesting features (of which conformal invariance is just the most important),
which make them interesting either as a laboratory for investigations in the spirit of [1] and
the questions raised above, or for the description of physical phenomena in limited energy
ranges. in some respects, theories having a similar status are the higher-derivative theories.
both have non-trivial renormalizable interactions and propagate ghosts. both can be conformal
at the classical level and might have conformal windows at the quantum level. in some cases,
they have a positive-denite action in the euclidean framework. yet, higher-derivative theories
appear to be less promising for our purposes.

some of our theories have a special gauge invariance, which is investigated in detail.

it
is a higher-derivative gauge symmetry, the unique gauge transformation compatible with the
conformal symmetry. moreover, these theories admit proper denitions of eld strengths, dual
eld strengths, chernsimons forms, topological invariants, etc. the ghost propagation is a
delicate issue in the presence of this higher-derivative gauge symmetry; i discuss some features
that should be kept in mind when attempting to remove the ghosts from the theory. this might
happen dynamically, at low energies, thanks to quantum irreversibility itself (the ghosts might
disappear above the planck length, far before the physically observable degrees of freedom) or
a generalization of the nachtmann theorem [7].

the ghost propagation is exhibited by violations of the ferraragattogrillo theorem [8],
stating that primary composite operators with spin s should have a total dimension greater
than or equal to 2 + s.
indeed, the higher-derivative gauge invariance allows for multiply-
conserved currents with dimensions  = 2 + s, 1 + s, . . ., 3. some of these operators will be

6

constructed explicitly.

the study of higher-spin conformal eld theory is in some sense complementary to the
fradkinvasiliev higher-spin eld theory [9], which is not conformal, but does not propagate
ghosts.

there have been earlier works on conformal eld equations of spin 2 [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] and
spin 3/2 [13] elds. these theories are particular cases of the ones presented below. to my
knowledge the relationship between conformal invariance and higher-derivative gauge invariance
was not known. recently, related theories have received some interest in the domain of nuclear
physics, where the purpose is to account for the hadronic resonances, such as the spin-3/2
(1232) [17, 18]. i believe that the properties outlined here might be useful in this domain, at
least in a denite energy range.

the plan of the paper is as follows. i present the bosonic conformal elds in section 2, the
fermionic elds in section 4. section 3 is devoted to a detailed analysis of the spin-2 eld, with
computations of c and a and a study of the operator product (ope) structure. in section 4 the
contribution to the gauge beta function from conformal spin-3/2 matter fermions is computed.
section 5 contains observations about higher-derivatives conformal eld theories. i work in the
euclidean framework throughout this paper.

before beginning our investigation, i mention that a dierent approach to the problem of
dening c and a for gravity might start from the results of christensen and du [19], where
the trace anomaly in external gravity is calculated for elds with arbitrary spin. the results,
however, are dicult to interpret in our context, because the trace anomaly contains the square
of the ricci curvature r :

 =

1

(4)2(cid:20)cw 2 +

a
4

g4 + r2 

2

ar(cid:21) .

this is a sign that the theory is not conformal. the denition of c and a from the trace anomaly
are unambiguous only if there is no such term. yet, since the dierence c  a multiplies the
unique term containing the riemann tensor, r2
, there might still be an appropriate denition
of c = a theories of gravitons and gravitinos: these should be the theories whose trace anomaly
contains only r2
. i recall, indeed, that in arbitrary even dimensions
the trace anomaly of the c = a theories contains the minimal amount of riemann tensors, as
shown in ref. [5]. explicitly, for spin-3/2 and spin-2 we nd, from table ii of ref. [19] (omitting
the r-term):

we see that the graviton and gravitino contributions to the r2-term have opposite signs. this
means that a suitable combination of gravitons and gravitinos can cancel the r2-term and
might be suitable for the ir limit of a theory satisfying the conformal hypothesis. although

7

i do not pursue this strategy further in this paper, i emphasize that it would be extremely
interesting to re-examine the analysis of christensen and du in this spirit.

2 conformal bosonic elds

the simplest example of higher-spin conformal eld theory is the free spin-2 conformal eld.

let  be symmetric and traceless. the action

where i(x) = 2xx /|x|2. this invariance xes uniquely the action s, and the lagrangian
l1 up to total derivatives. a better choice of the total derivatives leads to the lagrangian

l =

(2.4)

l transforms as a scalar under coordinate inversion, l |x|8l. the action s is invariant under
the higher-derivative gauge transformation

 ,

(2.5)

but not with respect to the dieomorphism-type transformation  =  +  . the
lagrangian l is also invariant, while l1 is invariant up to a total derivative.

the gauge-transformation (2.5) is compatible with the conformal symmetry. this can be
proved by observing that  has dimension 1 and thus, under coordinate inversion, 
transforms in the same way as :

  |x|2,

   |x|2i(x)i(x)(cid:18)

to check this, observe that the derivative operator transforms as a vector of dimension 1:

2.1 field strength

the gauge symmetry (2.5) leads to the introduction of a natural eld strength,

f =    

1

,

which is easily proved to be gauge-invariant. this eld strength satises a number of noticeable
properties. first of all, we have the identities

f = f,

f = 0,

f + f + f = 0.

(2.6)

the third identity will be called the cyclic identity. secondly, the lagrangian (2.4) can be
written as

l =

1
4

(f)2,

which implies, in particular, that it is positive-denite, a fact that was not evident from (2.3)
and (2.4). since l is a conformal eld of dimension 4, it is evident that the eld strength is
itself a conformal eld of dimension 2 and transforms as

under coordinate inversion. the eld equations read

f  |x|4i(x)i(x)i(x)f

f + f = 0.

(2.7)

it is convenient to introduce the dual of the eld strength, as well as self-dual and anti-self-

dual eld strengths:

f =

1

f,

f 

 =

1

2(cid:16)f  f(cid:17) .

each of these tensors satises the same symmetry identities (2.6) as f. we can also derive
the bianchi identity

there is a natural topological invariant and a chern-simons form:

 f +  f = 0.

f f =  (f) .

non-trivial interactions for conformal higher-spin theories can be constructed, as power

series in the eld strength:

l =

 being some mass scale and a, b, c being dimensionless parameters. these vertices are non-
trivial because they do not vanish on the solutions to the eld equations (2.7). our interest,

9

however, is mostly to look for non-trivial renormalizable interactions, which preserve confor-
mality at the classical level. these are more dicult to construct, but are fundamental for the
conformal hypothesis stated in the introduction. certain renormalizable interactions will be
studied in this paper (for fermionic higher-spin conformal theories), but a complete classication
will not be given here.

the coupling to gravity is not straightforward and might not exist at all. simple attempts
to impose the compatibility between the gauge symmetry (2.5) and gravity generate terms that
cannot be reabsorbed. nevertheless, this does not forbid a correct denition of c and a (see
section 3).

2.2 quantization

in the presence of a higher-derivative gauge invariance, the problem of ghost-propagation is
delicate. in this section i calculate the propagators and discuss a number of important features.

the most natural gauge-xing is

 = a = 0.

the gauge-xed lagrangian becomes

i now show that the ghosts of the theory are precisely a. if we impose

(2.10)

not only the ghosts are killed, but just two helicities eectively propagate.

with this condition the eld equations reduce to an ordinary wave equation for ,  =
0. moreover, the propagator, saturated with -polarizations, becomes just | (k)|2/k2 and we
have to show that the numerator | (k)|2 is positive in the lorentzian framework. now, the
gauge-xing   = 0 gives, in momentum space,

00 + ninjij = 2ni0i,

where ni = ki/k0, i = 1, 2, 3, and k2

which, reinserted into (2.11), also give

njij = 0i,

00 = ni0i,

i.e. 0 = 0, justifying (2.10). the condition of vanishing trace for  gives ii = 00 =
ninjij. we have therefore

||2 = |ij|2 + |ii|2  2|njij|2.

let us choose ni = (0, 0, 1). the condition ii = ninjij gives 22 = 11 and nally

||2 = 2(|11|2 + |12|2)  0.

not only do we get positivity, conrming that no ghost propagates when (2.10) in enforced,
but we discover that just two helicities propagate. the four conditions (2.10) leave us with ve
independent -components, 11, 12 and i3, but there is no physical propagation of the i3.
this means that there is a sort of hidden symmetry. we have therefore identied the ghosts of
the theories in a. the theory becomes unitary as soon as the vector a disappears by some
mechanism not known at present.

using the recipes of [20, 21].

2.4 implications of the higher-derivative gauge invariance on correlators

the general form of the two-point function of a conformal composite operator o1s with spin
s is, in the notation of [20, 21]:

is the unique dierential operator of degree 2s that is completely symmetric
and traceless in 1  s and 1  s, symmetric in the exchange   , conserved with respect
2 ( + ) 
3  . the factor cs is a constant (higher-spin central charge) and hs is equal to s  s  2,
where s is the total dimension of the operator o1s.

, = 1

1

if the operator o1s couples to a conformal higher-spin eld 1s, via a vertex o1s1s,

then the following multiple-conservation condition holds:

1  so1s = 0.

(2.16)

an ordinary conservation condition so1s = 0 implies hs = 0.
instead, applying the
multiple-conservation condition (2.16) to the correlator (2.15), we nd that hs can take an
arbitrary integer value between 0 and 1  s. consequently, we have the following spectrum of
allowed dimensions:

s = 2 + s, 1 + s, , 3.

(2.17)

observe that only the operators of dimension 3 need s divergences to be annihilated. operators
of higher dimension are allowed to satisfy more restrictive conditions. in particular, operators
of dimension 2 + s can be conserved in the usual sense (1o1s = 0), operators of dimension
1 + s can be annihilated by two divergences (1 2o1s = 0), etc.

the ferraragattogrillo theorem [8] says that primary conformal operators with spin-s
have dimensions s  2 + s. this property, a direct consequence of unitarity, is here violated.
this is how the non-unitarity of the theory shows up in this context. we see from (2.17) that

13

the minimal allowed dimension is 3. this feature is relevant to the conformal hypothesis stated
in the introduction: the interaction vertex

is renormalizable if o1s is such an operator of dimension 3; therefore, in our theories,
renormalizable higher-spin interactions are not ruled out in a trivial way.

3 the spin-2 conformal boson in detail

in this section i study the stress-tensor of the spin-2 conformal boson, compute its two-point
function and ope, and extract the central charges c and a. the result is that both c and a have
positive values. since, in particular, a can be regarded as a counter of the (massless) degrees of
freedom, positivity means that the physical degrees of freedom prevail over the ghost ones. in
higher-derivative theories, on the contrary, we will see that both c and a are typically negative.

3.1 computation of c
the eld-strength propagator hf(x) f (0)i is, by conformal invariance, 1/|x|2d times a
linear combination of the following three conformal structures:

c (1)
, (x) = (i(x)i(x)  i(x)i(x))i(x),
c (2)
, = (ii  ii)i  (  ),
c (3)
, = (i  i)  (  ),

where d is the dimension of f (2 in the free-eld limit). the trace and cyclic conditions (2.6) x
the combination of c (1), c (2) and c (3) uniquely up to the overall factor, which can be found by
direct inspection, using the -propagator worked out in the previous section. the nal result
reads

(3.18)

hf(x) f (0)i =

but, because the coupling to gravity is problematic and actually might not exist, this form of
the stress tensor, and most importantly its overall coecient, should be checked directly from
the algebra of the poincare group. the unusual factor will be xed this way in the next section.
the more natural expression t = 2f +
, dierring from the above one by a factor 4/3,
does not close the algebra correctly.

this operator is conserved in  ( t = 0), gauge-invariant and traceless up to total derivatives,
and it does not transforms correctly under coordinate inversion. for this reason, it is not simple
to use the noether tensor to extract c and a. moreover, there exists no improvement term

3.2 ope structure and computation of a

the ope structure exhibits novel features with respect to the ordinary theories. in particular,
the presence of ghosts is exhibited by higher-spin composite operators of low dimensionality.
the ope of two stress tensors contains: the central charge c, with singularity 1/|x|8; the
stress-tensor itself, with singularity 1/|x|4; higher-spin currents of dimension 2 + s, 1 + s, 3,
where s is the spin; descendants and regular terms. the rst higher-spin current is a spin-4,
dimension-4 operator appearing at the same level as the stress-tensor (singularity 1/|x|4). this
operator reads

the primed sum is understood to be divided by the number of permutations. the operator
 = 0. the proof of this fact
is lengthy and involves repeated use of the cyclic identity and the eld equations. observe in
particular that f = 0 on the solutions to the eld equations. i illustrate the strategy
of the proof on the most involved term, which is

f +

 f 

.

first, we exchange  and  by using the property of self-duality in  and anti-self-duality in
. we then use the cyclic identity on f 

 and arrive at

f +

  (f

).

15

we use the eld equations to replace f 
identical to the starting one. we move it on the left-hand side and write

 with f 

 and observe that we obtain a term

f +

the other non-trace terms in o(4)

 can be shown to vanish in a similar way. finally,
the trace terms always contain the stress tensor and obey the multiple-conservation condition
because the stress tensor is conserved.

, which is however orthogonal to the

we can dene our a in the following way. the scalar, spinor and vector ope terms (t t )t
are a basis for the ope structure [20]. we use the stress-tensor two-point function and the
t t ope to associate eective numbers ns,f,v of scalars, fermions and vectors to the spin-2
conformal eld and then apply the free-elds formulas for c and a.

we write

h(t t ) ti = nsh(t t ) tis + nfh(t t ) tif + nvh(t t ) tiv.

here (t t ) means that we take the limit in which the distance between the rst two t -insertions
tends to zero, and so we can use the ope calculated above. on the right-hand side, h(t t ) tis,f,v
denote the corresponding expressions for one free real scalar, one fermion and one vector, which
can be read in [20]. clearly, only the t -content of the ope is relevant in the limit we are
considering: h(t t ) ti = (t t )tht ti, where (t t )t denotes the structure multiplying t in the
t t ope. for example, (t t )t is the structure contained between the rst square brackets in
(3.19). we have

c (t t )t =

s + 6 nf (t t )t

f + 12 nv(t t )t

1

120(cid:2)ns(t t )t

v(cid:3) .

(3.20)

using the two-point functions and opes of free elds [20] we arrive, by comparison, at

ns = 0,

nf =

256
27

,

nv =

64
27

.

observe that ns = 0 can be inferred immediately from the ope. scalar elds produce a structure
s with the maximal number of uncontracted xs (six), vector elds give a structure (t t )t
(t t )t
v
with the minimum number (two) and (t t )t
f , for the spinors, contain four uncontracted xs. a
quick inspection of the propagator shows that our structure (t t )t cannot contain more than
four uncontracted xs.

the nal result is

c =

32
45

,

a =

848
1215

,

c  a

c

=

.

we see that both c and a are positive, as well as nf and nv, and that c is almost equal to a,
but slightly greater.

the procedure used to calculate c and a (3.20) guarantees that these values parametrize the
trace anomaly in the appropriate way. however, we cannot write a closed expression for the
trace anomaly such as (1.1), which makes use of the coupling to external gravity, and we need
to work always at the level of correlators and opes. it is meaningful, nevertheless, to truncate
the right-hand side of (1.1) to the quadratic terms in an expansion of the gravitational eld
around at space.

we have therefore shown that c and a can be appropriately dened in our theories despite
the absence of a coupling to external gravity, and that they are positive. some issues need to

be better understood, for example the relationship between the gauge-invariant stress tensor
t and the noether tensor.

the presence of this multiply-conserved, spin-4, dimension-4 operator, absent in ordinary the-
ories, is here emphasized, as a good illustration of the new features of higher-spin conformal
eld theory and the role of the multiple-conservation condition. the hope is that the ghost
degrees of freedom, or spin-s operators with dimension lower than 2 + s, might be controlled in
some way. a suciently strong interaction might raise the dimensions of all operators. i recall
that the nachtmann theorem [7], in unitary theories, states that the anomalous dimensions
of the higher-spin currents generated by the singular terms of the ope are to some extent
correlated [15, 16] (e.g. the anomalous dimensions increase with the spin and the magnitude of
the interaction). it is conceivable that a similar result here would assure that below a certain
energy threshold, when the interaction is suciently strong, the theory is perfectly unitary, i.e.
all spin-s operators have dimension greater than or equal to 2 + s.

3.3 antisymmetric conformal tensors

with antisymmetric tensors, many of the nice features of symmetric tensors disappear.
in
particular, conformal invariance spoils both the positivity of the action and gauge invariance.
a 2-form a has the conformal-invariant action

s =

1

2z (cid:2)(a )2  4(a )2(cid:3) .

with a =    we nd s =  1
and gauge invariance is completely lost. the theory can be coupled in a (classically) conformal
way to abelian and non-abelian gauge elds, as well as gravity. renormalizable couplings to
symmetric higher-spin conformal elds is instead problematic. for example, a coupling of a
complex antisymmetric tensor with a spin-3 eld of the pauli type, such as

2r (a )2, so that the action is not positive-denite

igf a a = o(3)

 + total derivatives

vanishes because of the cyclic identity.

the a -eld equations and propagator read

a2(a +a) = 0,

ha (x) a(0)i = 1

82|x|2 (i(x)i(x)  i(x)i(x)) .

observe that the propagator is reection-negative. we conclude that antisymmetric conformal
tensor elds are much less interesting than the symmetric tensors.

18

4 conformal fermionic elds

a spin-(s + 1/2) eld is described by a spinor 1s with s lorentz indices, completely sym-
metric and traceless.

the transformation of the spinor under coordinate inversion is

1(x) i s

the contraction 2s transforms as a spin-(s  1/2) conformal spinor. further contrac-
tions with gamma matrices are automatically zero, owing to complete tracelessness. instead
i=1 i1is transforms as a spin-(s + 1/2) spinor. therefore we can always impose

condition (4.21) is not sucient to eliminate the ghosts of the theory. we see that no
gauge invariance survives and the theory can be straightforwardly coupled to abelian and non-
abelian gauge elds, as well as gravity. in particular, c and a can be dened in the usual way.
in the next section, i discuss the case s = 1 in detail and compute the contribution of conformal
spinors to the gauge beta function.

nuclear theory of hadronic resonances: see formula (40) of ref. [17]. its conformal invariance,
and the unicity of the theory in this respect, is here emphasized.

the theory is conformal at the classical level, and scale invariance is broken, as usual, by
the radiative corrections at the quantum level. i have computed the one-loop beta function of
this model in two dierent ways (gluon self-energy and three-gluon vertex), with the result

(g) = 

g3

482(cid:2)11c(g)  20c(r3/2)  4c(r1/2)(cid:3) .

the correction due to our spin-3/2 eld is the term proportional to c(r3/2), while the term
proportional to c(r1/2) is the usual spin-1/2 contribution, here inserted for comparison.

we see that this peculiar type of matter contributes to the beta function with the same
sign as ordinary matter. for c(r3/2) . 11

with respect to the higher-order corrections, which allow us to conclude that there is a non-

main reason why these theories are an interesting laboratory of models for the ideas of [1].

4.2 spin-3/2 couplings

the spin-3/2 theory just studied propagates a spin-1/2 eld, namely   . despite this fact,
the lagrangian

l =     +    

cannot be used to couple our spin-3/2 eld to an ordinary spin-1/2 eld . this kinetic term is
forbidden by conformal invariance. indeed,    transforms as

    |x|2x/5    4|x|2x/5x  ,

where we have used    = 0. this example shows that conformality is a non-trivial restriction,
although certainly less restrictive than the ordinary higher-spin gauge invariance. on the other
hand, the vertex

m

(cid:0)  +  (cid:1) ,

commonly used in nuclear physics to describe the -decay into a nucleon and a pion, has a well-
dened conformal weight, but its dimension is 5. it has to be multiplied by a parameter having
the dimension of a (mass)1. this kind of coupling does not satisfy the conformal hypothesis,
which however is meant only for fundamental theories. it remains to see whether this or similar
interactions (see (2.8)) can be generated in a more fundamental way from conformally invariant
theories, where conformality is broken only dynamically, by the rg scale .

5 higher-derivative conformal eld theories

i conclude with remarks about higher-derivative conformal eld theories, starting from the free
higher-derivative scalar eld. this case is interesting, because it corresponds to the induced
action for the conformal factor  and is described by the lagrangian

s =

2z d4xg(cid:20)4 +
3 (r) [22, 23] and g4 = g4 2

g4(cid:21) ,

q
16

where 4 = 2 +2r 2
r is the pondered
euler density [3]. q is the background charge. this theory has been comprehensively studied
in rfs. [23] and is the four-dimensional analogue of the free two-dimensional scalar eld. non-
unitarity is evident from the fact that c and a are negative:

c =

a =

90  q2.

(5.24)

the values at q = 0 can be read from [23]. we see that no real value of the background charge
can give a positive a. moreover, the background charge has no eect on c. the value of c can
be checked by computing the stress-tensor two-point function and does not depend on q. the
stress tensor reads

where d2 = dd. each term can be further multiplied by a polynomial 1 + h. some
simplication comes from the invariance of the theory under the renormalizable change of
variables

 being a parameter of no physical interest.

the change of the statistics of the elds does not eliminate the non-unitarity of the theory.
indeed, the low-dimensionality of ,  allows us to construct many operators violating the
ferraragattogrillo theorem. there are also operators satisfying reection positivity before
the change of statistics and violating it afterwards. for example

h( )(x) ( )(0)i = (h(x) (0)i)2 < 0.

finally, there are also operators having a vanishing two-point function, such as two terms of
the electromagnetic current:

despite the unitarity problem, renormalization of this theory is well-behaved and very pre-
sumably there is a conformal window, at least when the gauge eld is non-abelian. theories
like these are a useful laboratory for the approach of [1].

by imposing conservation and tracelessness. it is not straightforward to x the overall factor h
from the coupling to gravity. indeed, a weyl-invariant coupling to external gravity might not
exist. the factor could be xed unambiguously with the ope technique of sect. 3.2 or the
noether method, but here we do not need it, since our primary concern is to show that c is
negative, independently of the value of h. we nd

we might wonder whether the situation changes in higher dimensions, but it is not so. i have

the purpose of the research addressed in the present paper is to show that quantum irreversibil-
ity is a fundamental principle of nature and that, on the other hand, the newton constant is
not a fundamental constant, but descends from the rg scale , in a similar way as qcd does.
the rst step is to seek candidate high-energy theories to implement these ideas. these
theories might have a very unusual aspect and be more similar to ordinary theories only below
a certain energy scale. we have learned that some theories are more promising than others. all
of our theories are good toy-models for investigations in the spirit of [1, 5], but, at the level of
physical applications, antisymmetric conformal tensors and higher-derivative theories exhibit

23

severe violations of positive deniteness and reection positivity. the quantities c and a can
be turned from negative to positive in higher-derivative theories by changing the statistics of
the elds. nevertheless, even after changing the statistics, the resulting theories appear to be
less nice than the higher-spin conformal theories of bosonic and fermionic symmetric elds.

the encouraging results are that both c and a are typically positive in the higher-spin
conformal eld theories, the action is positive-denite, there is a peculiar gauge symmetry,
non-trivial interactions, both renormalizable and non-renormalizable, conformal windows, and
so on. the propagation of ghosts is best viewed as a violation of the ferraragattogrillo
theorem and is to some extent under control, or, at least, does not seem so severe as to reject
these theories right away. analogues of the nachtmann theorem, or quantum irreversibility
itself, might prove unitarity at suciently strong interactions.
