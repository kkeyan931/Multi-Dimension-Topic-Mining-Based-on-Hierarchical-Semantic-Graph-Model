abstract

in four-dimensional n = 2 compactications of string theory or m-theory, modications of
the bekenstein-hawking area law for black hole entropy in the presence of higher-derivative
interactions are crucial for nding agreement between the macroscopic entropy obtained from
supergravity and subleading corrections to the microscopic entropy obtained via state counting.
here we compute the modications to the area law for various classes of black holes, such as
heterotic black holes, stemming from certain higher-derivative gravitational wilsonian coupling
functions. we consider the extension to heterotic n = 4 supersymmetric black holes and
their type-ii duals and we discuss its implications for the corresponding micro-state counting.
in the eective eld theory approach the wilsonian coupling functions are known to receive
non-holomorphic corrections. we discuss how to incorporate such corrections into macroscopic
entropy formulae so as to render them invariant under duality transformations, and we give a
concrete example thereof.

1 introduction

in the presence of higher-derivative interactions, modications of the bekenstein-hawking area
law for the macroscopic entropy of a black hole are crucial for nding agreement with microscopic
entropy calculations based on state counting. the latter involve corrections that are subleading
in the limit of large charges, and these corrections are captured on the macroscopic side by the
modications of the area law that ensure the validity of the rst law of black hole mechanics in
the presence of higher-derivative interactions. for supersymmetric black hole solutions arising
in four-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric eective eld theories with terms quadratic in the
riemann tensor, they were determined in [1], where it was shown that, for a particular class
of black holes arising in compactications of m-theory and type-iia string theory, the modied
macroscopic entropy exactly matches the microscopic entropy computed in [2, 3].

the four-dimensional supersymmetric black hole solutions considered in [1] are static, rotation-
ally symmetric solitonic interpolations between two n = 2 supersymmetric groundstates: at
minkowski spacetime at spatial innity and bertotti-robinson spacetime at the horizon [4]. the
crucial ingredients of the work reported in [1] are as follows. one departs from the bekenstein-
hawking area formula and adopts walds proposal for the entropy based on a noether charge
associated with an isometry evaluated at the corresponding killing horizon [5, 6]. the compu-
tation of the macroscopic entropy is based on the eective n = 2 wilsonian action describing
the couplings of abelian vector multiplets to n = 2 supergravity in the presence of a certain
class of terms quadratic in the riemann tensor. this wilsonian action is determined from a
holomorphic, homogeneous function f (y, ), where the y i denote the (rescaled) complex scalar
elds which reside in the abelian vector multiplets, and where  denotes the (rescaled) square
of the (auxiliary) anti-selfdual lorentz tensor eld t ab ij which resides in the weyl multiplet.
the macroscopic entropy of a static, supersymmetric black hole computed from the eective
wilsonian lagrangian is then given by [1]

s = h|z|2 + 4 im(cid:16) f(y, )(cid:17)i with  = 64 .

(1.1)

the rst term in the entropy formula, |z|2 = pifi (y, )  qiy i , coincides with the bekenstein-
hawking area contribution. the values of the scalar elds y i on the horizon are, when assuming
xed-point behaviour [7, 8], determined in terms of the magnetic and electric charges (pi , qi )
carried by the black hole. their precise value is determined from a set of equations, called the
stabilization equations, which take the following form [9]:

y i  y i = i pi ,

fi (y, )  fi ( y , ) = i qi

.

(1.2)

the entropy is thus entirely determined in terms of the charges carried by the extremal black
hole.

the above equations can usually not be solved in explicit form. often they can be solved
by iteration, order-by-order in . let q denote a generic electric or magnetic charge. then
the homogeneity of the function f implies that the entropy can be expanded in powers of q,
according to



ag q22g ,

s = 

xg=0

1

(1.3)

with constant coecients ag. these coecients follow from the coecient functions in the power

expansion for the holomorphic function f , which takes the form f (y, ) = pg0 f (g)(y ) g.

in this paper we present a variety of applications of the entropy formula (1.1). in particular we
consider n = 2 heterotic black holes, whose macroscopic entropy formula can be generalized to
the case of n = 4 supersymmetric black holes. in order to appreciate the consequences of our
results we will return to the counting of micro-states in the dual type-ii or m-theory version
of these black holes, following the same approach as in [2, 3]. in this analysis certain special
features of k3  t 2 emerge which are not present for generic calabi-yau threefolds, implying
that the micro-state counting in the former case is more subtle than in the latter case. based
on this analysis we propose a modication of the state counting for k3 t 2 which is consistent
with the macroscopic result.

several comments are in order here. first, as mentioned above, the entropy formula (1.1) is based
on the wilsonian lagrangian approach. in this approach, the coupling function multiplying the
square of the weyl tensor c is denoted by im f. it is customary to assume that f possesses

a power expansion in , i.e., f =pg1 f (g)(y )g1. as pointed out recently in [10], this is not

necessarily the case due to the fact that the f is non-analytic at  = 0. second, the stabilization
equations (1.2) are constructed out of the two symplectic vectors (pi , qi) and (y i , fi (y, )). it
is important to note that under symplectic transformations the y i will in general transform
into -dependent terms. thus, under the subset of duality transformations the moduli elds
za = y a/y 0 will, in the presence of c 2
-terms (that is f 6= 0), transform into -dependent
quantities! finally, we recall that in theories with massless elds the physical eective couplings
are dierent from the wilsonian couplings, which presuppose the presence of an infrared cut-o.
while the physical couplings have dierent analyticity properties, they fully capture the physics
and its underlying symmetries. thus, in order to arrive at entropy formulae that are manifestly
duality invariant, it is necessary to modify both (1.1) and (1.2), which were derived in a wilsonian
approach, by taking into account non-holomorphic corrections to the physical eective couplings.
in the context of string theory one can actually determine these non-holomorphic terms, because
the massless states are included in the string loops. here we choose to incorporate the non-
holomorphic corrections by imposing the correct symmetry behaviour. therefore we include
certain non-holomorphic corrections to the -dependent part of the function f , or equivalently,
to f(y, y , ). here the corresponding f (y, y , ) is homogenous of degree two in y and
of degree zero in y . the corrections to f should be such that the associated symplectic
vector (y i , fi (y, y , )) transforms in the same way as (pi , qi ) under symplectic transformations
associated with electric/magnetic duality. the associated stabilization equations now read

y i  y i = i pi ,

fi (y, y , )  fi (y, y , ) = i qi .

(1.4)

provided that the duality transformations on the y i induce the corresponding symplectic trans-
formations on the fi , the quantity |z|2 = pi fi (y, y , )  qi y i is then invariant under duality
transformations. however, in order to arrive at a duality invariant expression for the entropy of
an n = 2 black hole, it will not suce to only take into account the above modication of f
and, hence, of |z|2. as it turns out, also the second term associated with the deviation from
the area law requires a non-holomorphic correction. hence we are forced to use the following
expression for the entropy:

s = hpi fi (y, y , )  qi y i + 4 im(cid:16) f(y, y , ) + (y, y , )(cid:17)i , with  = 64 , (1.5)

2

where (y, y , ) denotes an appropriate quantity whose role is to render im ( f + ) du-
ality invariant. in general it should be complicated to determine the explicit form of the non-
holomorphic corrections entering both in (1.4) and (1.5) due to the fact, mentioned above, that
the moduli elds za will transform into -dependent terms under duality transformations. this
is to be contrasted with the usual approach for determining non-holomorphic corrections to
physical couplings in string theory [11, 12, 13], in which each of the gravitational coupling func-
tions in the expansion of the holomorphic function f in powers of  is required to transform
as a modular function of the appropriate weight. this is achieved by taking into account non-
holomorphic corrections to these coupling functions, which are governed by a set of recursive
holomorphic anomaly equations. in the case at hand, however, not only does f (y, y , ) and
therefore also the symplectic vector (y i , fi (y, y , )) and |z|2 receive non-holomorphic correc-
tions, but there are additional non-holomorphic contributions encoded in . while this is an
important feature of the above mechanism for incorporating non-holomorphic corrections into
macroscopic entropy formulae, its real signicance is not yet clear to us.

the structure of this paper is as follows. in section 2 we compute the macroscopic entropy of a
generic tree-level black hole in a heterotic n = 2 compactication in the presence of a tree-level
c 2
-term. subsequently we consider its extension to n = 4 supersymmetric black holes. in
section 3 we then reconsider the n = 2 and n = 4 counting of micro-states in the dual type-ii
and m-theory formulations of the black holes. we show that the expression for the macroscopic
n = 4 entropy agrees with a microscopic entropy computation along the lines of [2, 3] for a class
of black holes occuring in dual type-ii compactications on k3  t 2, provided that the micro-
state counting for k3  t 2 is suitably modied, as we discuss. in section 4 we turn to the issue
of non-holomorphic corrections to the macroscopic entropy. we discuss a heterotic-like n = 2
model for which we are able to determine the non-holomorphic corrections to the entropy needed
for obtaining a strong-weak coupling duality invariant expression for the entropy. and nally, in
section 5, we use the recent results of [10] to compute corrections to the macroscopic entropy of
certain type-iia black holes stemming from t abij-dependent higher-derivative interaction terms
in the eective action.

2 heterotic tree-level black holes

in the presence of an (s + s) c 2
-term in the eective wilsonian action, where s is the
dilaton eld, the tree-level holomorphic function f (y, ) associated with a heterotic n = 2
compactication on k3  t 2 is given by

with real constants ab and c1.
in a type-ii dual picture, these constants can be related to
geometrical properties of the k3 bration of the corresponding calabi-yau space. the dilaton
eld s is dened by s = iy 1/y 0.

using (1.2) with i = a one readily proves that the y a are given by

y a =

where ab bc = a

|z|2 = pi fi  qiy i

as well as

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

combining these two equations and substituting the values for the y a yields

= (cid:16)

y 0  1(cid:17)h  y aaby b + c1 i + h.c. .

|z|2 = (s + s)(cid:16) 1

2 hn, ni + (c1  + h.c.)(cid:17) ,

where hn, ni = 2(n 0n 1 +n aabn b) = 2(p0q1 +paabpb). the vector n i of magnetic charges (in
a certain duality basis) is dened by n i = (p0, q1, p2, p3, . . . , pn), and transforms linearly under
the target-space duality group so(2, n  1). the second independent vector of electric charges,
which also transforms linearly under the target-space duality group, will be needed shortly and
equals mi = (q0,p1, q2, q3, . . . , qn).
from (2.6) we can now determine the entropy of a generic heterotic black hole, by using (1.1).
the second term in the formula doubles the coecient of the second term in (2.6) and we nd

s = 1

2  (s + s)(cid:16)hn, ni  512 c1(cid:17) .

for c1 = 0 this expression coincides with the one given in [14], where it was also shown that in
the presence of string-loop corrections the entropy takes the same form as the tree-level entropy,
but with the heterotic tree-level coupling constant s + s replaced by the perturbative coupling
constant.

now we continue and nd the equations that govern the value of the dilaton eld in terms of the
charges. just as above we use the equations (1.2) to write down expressions for the combinations
s s q1 p0 + q0 p1 and i( s  s) q1 p0 + q1 p1  q0 p0, which do not explicitly depend on y 0. this
leads to two equations for s:

s s hn, ni = hm, mi  2(s + s)(c1  s + h.c.) ,
(s  s)hn, ni = 2i m  n + 2 (s + s) (c1   h.c.) .

(2.8)

at the horizon this leads to the following results for the dilaton and for the entropy formula,

s = shm, mihn, ni  (m  n )2
hn, ni (hn, ni  512 c1)
s =  qhm, mihn, ni  (m  n )2 s1 

m  n

(2.9)

where we recall the three target-space duality invariant combinations of the charges [15],

hm, mi = 2(cid:16)m0m1 + 1
4 maabmb(cid:17) = 2(cid:16)  q0p1 + 1
hn, ni = 2(cid:16)n 0n 1 + n aabn b(cid:17) = 2(cid:16)p0q1 + paabpb(cid:17) ,
m  n = mi n i = q0p0  q1p1 + q2p2 +  + qnpn .

4 qaabqb(cid:17) ,

(2.10)

a signicant feature of these results is that they are manifestly invariant under the continuous
so(2, n  1) target-space duality transformations, which are valid in the tree approximation.
we analyze these transformations as well as the discrete s-duality transformations in section 4.

the above entropy formula can be immediately generalized to the case of a heterotic n = 4
compactication with a tree-level term proportional to (res) c 2
 turned on. this can be done
by replacing the so(2, n 1) bilinear combinations of the charges by the appropriate so(6, 22)
bilinears in (2.9). here we remind the reader that the n = 4 electric/magnetic charges are
associated with six graviphotons of pure supergravity and 22 vector multiplets, whose n = 2
decomposition is as follows. one graviphoton belongs to the n = 2 graviton multiplet, four
graviphotons belong to the two n = 2 gravitini multiplets (which cannot be incorporated in
the context of the n = 2 theory discussed above), and one graviphoton belongs to an n = 2
vector multiplet. the additional 22 n = 4 matter multiplets each decompose into an n = 2
vector and an n = 2 hypermultiplet, so that altogether one is dealing with 67 complex moduli.
in the n = 2 truncation one thus has n = 23 and must suppress 4 of the 28 electric and 4
of the 28 magnetic charges. of course, the n = 2 truncation does not constitute by itself a
heterotic n = 2 string compactication, which has only n = 19 and which is described by
dierent wilsonian couplings functions beyond the tree approximation.

the n = 4 supersymmetric heterotic models have dual realizations as type-ii string theory
compactied on k3  t 2 and as eleven-dimensional m-theory compactied on k3  t 2  s1.
the n = 2 models have dual realizations as compactications of the same theories but now on
a generic calabi-yau manifold. in the next section we will discuss certain aspects of the state
counting for these dual realizations.

3 state counting for type-ii and m-theory black holes

motivated by the possible extension of the heterotic n = 2 black hole entropy formula to the
corresponding case of n = 4 supersymmetric black holes, we now return to the counting of
micro-states for the dual type-ii and m-theory realizations of the heterotic models discussed
above. if one restricts the four-dimensional charges in an appropriate way (we take p0 = qa = 0
for convenience, but the discussion should also apply to the more general case p0 = 0 by replacing
q0 by q0 as in [2]), then the black hole can be given a ten- or eleven-dimensional interpretation,
as follows. in the type-iia picture one wraps a d4-brane on a holomorphic four-cycle s in either
a generic calabi-yau threefold or in k3  t 2 and considers a bound state with |q0| d0-branes.
this will then lead to a four-dimensional black hole with n = 2 or n = 4 supersymmetry,
respectively. in the m-theory picture one wraps an m5-brane on the same cycle s and obtains
a ve-dimensional black string which is then wrapped around the m-theory circle. adding |q0|

5

quanta of lightlike momentum along this string yields a four-dimensional black hole with a nite
event horizon.

in both pictures a microscopic entropy can be computed along the lines of [2, 3]. the approach
of reference [2] is based on analyzing the two-dimensional -model that describes the massless
excitations of an m5-brane wrapped on s. then, using cardys formula, the asymptotic density
of states of a two-dimensional conformal eld theory in a nite volume is given by

d(|q0|, cl)  exp(smicro)  exp(cid:16)2q 1

6|q0|cl(cid:17) ,

(3.1)

where |q0| is large and counts quanta of lightlike, left-moving momentum, and cl is the central
charge for the left-moving sector. on the other hand in reference [3] the asymptotic growth of
the dimension of the moduli space of a bound state of a wrapped d4-brane with |q0| d0-branes
was computed. the explicit formulae given in [2, 3] assume certain properties of the four-cycle
s, and there it was mentioned that in the case of k3  t 2 additional subleading terms are to
be expected.
the holonomy group of k3  t 2 is su(2), unlike the holonomy group of a generic calabi-
yau threefold which is equal to su(3). this dierence reects itself in the number of residual
supersymmetries and in the dierent hodge diamonds which we will discuss below. we will
apply the methods of [2, 3] in parallel to both a generic calabi-yau threefold and to k3  t 2.
as it will turn out, in the case of k3  t 2 certain complications arise which indicate that the
associated state counting has to be modied in order to achieve consistency with the macroscopic
analysis based on n = 2 supergravity.

let us rst recall some geometric properties of calabi-yau threefolds [16, 17, 18, 19], starting
with the homology and cohomology of a calabi-yau threefold x, which is either k3  t 2 or
a generic one and which corresponds to an n = 4 or n = 2 supersymmetric compactication,
respectively. in the case of a generic calabi-yau manifold the only undetermined hodge numbers
are h2,1(x) and h1,1(x). in addition one has non-vanishing h0,0(x) = h3,0(x) = 1, whereas all
other independent hodge numbers vanish.
the hodge numbers of k3  t 2 are easily obtained from those of k3 and t 2. for later con-
venience let us derive them in terms of cohomology, i.e. by listing harmonic (p, q)-forms. the
harmonic forms on t 2 can be built out of the constant function, the (1, 0)-form dz and the
(0, 1)-form dz, where z is a holomorphic coordinate. on k3 one has the constant function, no
one-forms and 22 two-forms a, a = 2, . . . , 23, which can be decomposed into one (2, 0)-form ,
one (0, 2)-form  and twenty (1, 1)-forms. the reason for leaving out the index a = 1 will become
clear shortly. the harmonic (p, q)-forms on k3t 2 are readily found by taking appropriate prod-
ucts. the resulting independent hodge numbers for k3  t 2 are: h0,0 = h1,0 = h2,0 = h3,0 = 1
and h1,1 = h2,1 = 21. the two-forms on k3  t 2 will be denoted by a with a = 1, 2, . . . , 23,
where 1  dz  dz and the a are the k3 forms introduced above.
the triple intersection numbers cabc of a calabi-yau threefold are dened by

cabc = zx

a  b  c .

(3.2)

as we will be dealing with the integer-valued cohomology group h 2(x, z), the basic two-forms
are normalized such that the intersection numbers are integers. for x = k3t 2 the appropriate

6

normalization is based on

zk3

   = 1 ,

zt 2

1 = 1

and

zk3

a  b = cab ,

(3.3)

where cab is the intersection form of two-cycles in k3. the non-vanishing components of the
triple intersection form cabc of k3  t 2 are therefore
cab1 = cab .

(3.4)

in order to discuss the wrapping of d4- or m5-branes on four-cycles, we turn to the homology.
we recall that poincare duality provides a natural relation between i-forms  and 2k  i cycles
 for every real 2k-fold x by

z

 = zx

   ,

(3.5)

for all (2k  i)-forms . this denes an isomorphism between h i(x, r) and h2ki(x, r).
in the particular case of calabi-yau threefolds, four-cycles are dual to two-forms. we can
therefore x a basis for h4(x, r) by taking the four-cycles dual to a basis of h 2(x, r). this
basis will be denoted by a, where a = 1, . . . , , b2(x) and where b2(x) = dimr h 2(x, r) =
h2,0(x) + h1,1(x) + h0,2(x) is the second betti number. in the case of x = k3  t 2 we have
b2 = 23 and the cycles a with a 6= 1 are products of the basic two-cycles of k3 with t 2,
whereas 1 corresponds to k3. the four-cycle s on which the d4- or m5-brane is wrapped can
thus be expanded in a homology basis a,

s = pa a .

(3.6)

the integers pa count how many times the d4- or m5-brane is wrapped around the corresponding
cycle, so that we are actually dealing with integer-valued cohomology and homology groups,
h 2(x, z) and h4(x, z).
in four-dimensional terms the pa are magnetic charges, which are
quantized according to diracs rule.

by poincare duality the triple intersection numbers also count the numbers (weighted with ori-
entation) of intersections of generic four-cycles in a given homology class. the triple intersection
for a four-cycle is therefore

for k3  t 2 the non-vanishing triple intersections of four-cycles are

s  s  s = cabc papbpc .

a  b  1 = cab ,

so that the triple intersection of a four-cycle s in the class pa a + p1 1 is given by

s  s  s = 3 cab papbp1 .

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

another quantity that will appear in the microscopic entropy formula is the second chern class
c2(x) of x evaluated on the four-cycle s. recall that the second chern class is a four-form
which denes a cohomology class in h 4(x, z). hence there is a dual two-cycle in h2(x, z)
which we will denote be c2. since x is a calabi-yau manifold we can choose a basis a of
h2(x, z) which is dual to the basis a of h4(x, z), i.e. a  b = a
b. expanding c2 = c2aa
we nd

c2  s = zs

c2(x) = c2a pa .

(3.10)

7

for k3  t 2 the total chern class can be computed from the total chern classes of k3 and t 2
by the whitney product formula:

c(k3  t 2) = c(k3)  c(t 2) = (1 + c2(k3))  1 = 1 + c2(k3) ,

(3.11)

where we used c1(k3) = 0 and c1(t 2) = 0. since c2(k3) is the euler class of k3 and since k3
has euler number 24 we nd

c2  s = (k3) p1 = 24 p1 .

(3.12)

so far we have discussed only topological aspects of the threefold. but in order to get a su-
persymmetric state by wrapping a d4- or m5-brane on s, the four-cycle must be holomorphic
[20] and must therefore dene a divisor in x. a divisor is an integer linear combination of
irreducible analytic hypersurfaces, where the word analytic emphasizes that a divisor can be
locally characterized as the zero locus of a holomorphic function. the corresponding homology
classes are called algebraic. according to the lefschetz theorem on (1, 1)-classes, every coho-
mology class in h 2(x, z)  h 1,1(x, r) is algebraic. here the integer valued cohomology group
h 2(x, z) might be visualized as a lattice in the real vector space h 2(x, r), whereas h 1,1(x, r)
is a linear subspace. if the dimension of h 1,1(x, r) is smaller than the dimension of h 2(x, r)
and if the subspace h 1,1(x, r) is generic, then it will intersect the lattice h 2(x, z) in no point
but the origin. therefore it is in general not guaranteed that algebraic classes exist.

for generic calabi-yau threefolds, h2,0(x) = 0, and therefore h 1,1(x, r) will coincide with
h 2(x, r), implying that all fourth homology classes are algebraic. however for k3  t 2 we
have h2,0 = 1 and therefore h 1,1(x, r) is only contained in, but not identical with h 2(x, r).
obviously the problem resides in the k3 factor, which has h2,0(k3) = 1. whether or not a k3
space has algebraic classes is controlled by the so-called algebraic lattice, or picard lattice of
k3,

p = h 2(k3, z)  h 1,1(k3, r) .

(3.13)

special k3 spaces, which have a non-empty p and therefore have holomorphic cycles, are
called algebraic. hence we will below restrict ourselves to these algebraic k3 surfaces, which
are associated to subspaces of codimension 1 in the moduli space of complex structures.d

the computation of the microscopic entropy amounts to counting the massless excitations of a
d4- or m5-brane wrapped on s. in addition to being holomorphic, one has to require that s
is a so-called very ample divisor in order to ensure that the entropy calculation is not aected
by -corrections in the type-ii picture and by instanton corrections in the m-theory picture,
as we will discuss in due course. by denition a divisor s in a space x is called very ample if
x can be embedded into a complex projective space cpn such that s is the intersection of x
with some hyperplane in cpn . then bertinis theorem implies that, generically, s is a smooth
manifold. in our particular case the divisor s is a compact, complex kahler surface. on general
grounds one therefore expects that the collective modes of the wrapped brane are controlled by
the hodge numbers hp,q(s) of s. therefore we will discuss how the independent hodge numbers
h1,0(s), h2,0(s) and h1,1(s) of s are related to known quantities of x.

dconformal eld theories describing type-ii strings in the background of such algebraic k3 spaces have been
discussed in [21]. in particular the moduli spaces of algebraic k3 string backgrounds factorize into two subspaces
containing the complex structure moduli and the complexied kahler moduli, respectively. if one compacties
type-ii strings on k3  t 2, then this is the part of the moduli space that can be described in an n = 2 truncation
of the n = 4 theory.

three standard invariants can be computed using index theorems (only two of them are inde-
pendent due to the fact that a complex surface can only have two independent chern classes).
these are the euler number , the holomorphic euler number h and the hirzebruch signature
, dened by

(s) = pp,q(1)p+q hp,q(s) = 2  4h1,0(s) + 2h2,0(s) + h1,1(s) ,
h(s) = pq(1)q h0,q(s)

= 1  h1,0(s) + h2,0(s) ,
= 2h2,0(s)  h1,1(s) + 2 ,

(s) = b+

2 (s)

where we used that b
equal to b+
and (s) can be computed using the following index theorems:

2 (s)  b
2 (s), which denote the number of (anti)selfdual harmonic two-forms, are
2 (s) = h1,1(s)  1 for a compact kahler surface. now (s)

2 (s) = 2h2,0(s) + 1 and b

(3.14)

(s) = zs

c2(s) ,

(s) = zs(cid:16) 2

3 c2(s) + 1

3 c1(s)2(cid:17) ,

(3.15)

which then determines h(s) = 1

4 ( + ) as well.

to every very ample divisor s in x one can associate a line bundle l over x, such that s is
the zero locus of a holomorphic section of l. the space h 0(x, l) of holomorphic sections of l
is closely related to the moduli space m(s) of s, i.e. to the space of deformations of s inside
x. since divisors are obtained as zero loci of sections, multiplying a section by a non-vanishing
complex number does not change the divisor. therefore the moduli space of s is the projective
space associated to the vector space h 0(x, l):

m(s) = p h 0(x, l).

(3.16)

another way of thinking about the moduli of s is as sections of the normal bundle ns/x of s,

ns/x = t x|s /t s ,

(3.17)

where t x|s is the holomorphic tangent bundle of x restricted to s and t s is the holomorphic
tangent bundle of s. when wrapping a d-brane or m-brane on a holomorphic cycle, the scalar
elds of the world volume theory corresponding to transverse motions of s inside x become
sections of the normal bundle [22]. both descriptions of the moduli of s are equivalent because
the rst adjunction formula implies that the line bundles ns/x and l are isomorphic.

the next step is to express the chern classes of s in terms of the chern classes of x. because
the normal bundle ns/x of s is the quotient of the tangent bundle of x and of the tangent
bundle of s, the whitney product formula for chern classes implies c(x) = c(s)  c(ns/x ) or
(3.18)

1 + c1(x) + c2(x) +  = (1 + c1(s) + c2(s))  (1 + c1(ns/x )).

since x is calabi-yau, we have c1(x) = 0. hence one gets the relations c1(s) + c1(ns/x ) = 0
and c2(s) + c1(s)  c1(ns/x) = c2(x), which can be combined into

c2(s) = c2(x) + c1(ns/x )2 .

(3.19)

9

what remains is to express c1(ns/x ) by a quantity dened on x. to do so we recall that the
rst adjunction formula implies that the normal bundle ns/x is isomorphic to the line bundle l.
in particular the rst chern classes of both line bundles are equal, c1(ns/x ) = c1(l). moreover
the two-form c1(l) is poincare dual to the four-cycle s, and one can rewrite the above integrals
as integrals over x:

(s) = zx(cid:16)c2(x) + c1(l)2(cid:17)  c1(l) ,

(s) = zx (cid:16)  2

3 c2(x)  1

3 c1(l)2(cid:17)  c1(l) . (3.20)

finally the integrals on the right hand side can be interpreted as intersection products using

s3 := s  s  s = zx

c1(l)3 ,

zs

c2(x) = zx

c1(l)  c2(x) = c2  s ,

(3.21)

where c2 is the two-cycle poincare dual to c2(x). with these results one can express the
invariants in terms of intersection numbers,

(s) = s3 + c2  s ,

(s) =  1

3 s3  2

3 c2  s .

now it is straightforward to obtain the following relations for the hodge numbers,

h2,0(s) = 1
h1,1(s) = 2

6 s3 + 1
3 s3 + 5

12 c2  s + h1,0(s)  1 ,
6 c2  s + 2h1,0(s) ,

or, equivalently,

b+
2 (s) = 1
b
2 (s) = 2

3 s3 + 1
3 s3 + 5

6 c2  s + 2h1,0(s)  1 ,
6 c2  s + 2h1,0(s)  1 .

(3.22)

(3.23)

(3.24)

what remains is to calculate h1,0(s). here one uses again that s is a very ample divisor.
therefore the lefschetz hyperplane theorem implies that h1,0(s) = h1,0(x). thus we have
h1,0(s) = 0 when x is a generic calabi-yau threefold and h1,0(s) = 1 when x = k3  t 2.
the nal step in the approach of [2] is to count the massless left-moving bosons and fermions
of the wrapped m5-brane and to express them in terms of the topological quantities computed
above. as argued in [3] the analysis of the equivalent d4-d0 system should give the same answer.
we will follow [2].

in at space, the massless degrees of freedom of the m5-brane correspond to a six-dimensional
n = (0, 2) tensor multiplet, which contains a selfdual antisymmetric tensor, ve scalars which
describe transverse motions and two weyl spinors. in order to compute the microscopic entropy
one needs to dimensionally reduce this system on the divisor s and to count the massless modes
in the non-supersymmetric, left-moving sector of the resulting two-dimensional theory.

dimensional reduction of the antisymmetric tensor on s gives b
2 (s)
right-moving scalars together with b1(s) = 2 h1,0(s) gauge elds. two-dimensional gauge elds
do not carry dynamical degrees of freedom themselves, but may modify the counting for the
other modes. for a generic threefold one has b1(s) = b1(x) = 0 and this problem is absent.
a full analysis would require a detailed study of the eective -model describing the collective
modes of a m5-brane wrapped on the divisor s in k3  t 2. this will not be attempted here.

2 (s) left-moving and b+

10

instead we will rst review the counting performed in [2, 3] and assume that there are no
modications for k3  t 2. as we will see in a moment the resulting microscopic formula
contains, in the case of k3  t 2, sub-subleading terms that are puzzling from the supergravity
point of view. moreover, with this unmodied mode counting the right-moving sector of the
eective m5-brane theory turns out not to be supersymmetric. this implies that the microscopic
analysis in the case of k3  t 2 must be more subtle. we will then propose a modication of
the zero-mode counting which is consistent with the supergravity analysis.

the m5-brane theory in at space has 5 scalars describing the transverse motions. these split
into three scalars corresponding to the position of the brane in the three non-compact space
dimensions and two scalars corresponding to motions of the divisor s inside the calabi-yau
threefold. whereas the rst set just gives three scalar zero-modes, the zero-modes associated
to the second set are more subtle. one gets one zero-mode for every independent holomorphic
deformation of s inside x. in other words these zero-modes are sections of the normal bundle
ns/x. as reviewed above the dimension of the corresponding moduli space is

dimr m(s) = dimr p h 0(x, l) = dimr h 0(x, l)  2 .

(3.25)

it was emphasized in [2] that this quantity is hard to compute in general, but that there is a

riemann-roch index theorem for the holomorphic euler number h(l) = pi(1)i dimc h i(x, l)
of line bundles l over complex manifolds. we already mentioned that the divisor s is chosen to
be very ample. then the kodaira vanishing theorem together with the fact that x is a calabi-
yau manifold implies that dimc h i(x, l) = 0 for i > 0. therefore dimr m(s) = 2h(s)  2
and hence
(3.26)

dimr m(s) = 2 [h2,0(s)  h1,0(s)] .

this is the number of real left- and right-moving scalars related to transverse motions of s inside
x. combining it with the counting of modes descending from the antisymmetric tensor eld,
one nds that the number of left- and right-moving bosonic degrees of freedom is:

n left
bosonic = dimr m(s) + 3 + b
n right
bosonic = dimr m(s) + 3 + b+

2 (s) = 2h2,0(s) + h1,1(s) + 2  2h1,0(s) ,
2 (s) = 4h2,0(s) + 4  2h1,0(s) .

(3.27)

the number of real left- and right-moving fermions, on the other hand, is given by the sum of
odd and even cohomology elements, respectively [3]:

n left
n right

fermionic = 4h1,0(s) ,
fermionic = 4[h2,0(s) + h0,0(s)] .

(3.28)

the eective two-dimensional theory describing the collective modes of a bps black hole is a
(0, 4) supersymmetric sigma-model. here we recall that the (0, 4) worldsheet supersymmetry is
crucial for describing an n = 2 bps black hole in four-dimensional spacetime. therefore, the
number of right-moving bosons and fermions has to match. moreover the right-moving scalars
are expected to parametrize a quaternionic manifold and therefore the number of right-moving
real bosons should be a multiple of four. inspection of (3.27) and (3.28) shows that in the case
of a generic threefold, for which h1,0(s) = 0, the counting of right-moving modes is consistent
with (0, 4) supersymmetry, whereas this is not the case for k3 t 2, for which h1,0(s) = 1. this
implies that the zero-mode counting for k3  t 2 has to deviate from the one described above.

11

using (3.27) and (3.28) the central charge of the left-moving sector is computed to be

cl = n left

bosonic + 1

2 n left

fermionic = s3 + c2  s + 4h1,0(s)

= cabc papbpc + c2a pa + 4h1,0(s) .

(3.29)

for the generic case, where h1,0(s) = 0, this leads via cardys formula to the nal result [2, 3]

smicro = 2r 1

6|q0|(cid:16)cabc papbpc + c2a pa(cid:17) .

in the case of k3  t 2 the intersection and second chern class numbers take a simpler form.
using (3.29) with h1,0(s) = 1, the associated microscopic entropy (3.1) is computed to be

(3.30)

(3.31)

smicro = 2r 1

6|q0|(cid:16)3 cab papbp1 + 24 p1 + 4(cid:17) .

we note that the sub-subleading third term in this expression is not consistent with the macro-
scopic computation of the entropy based on n = 2 supergravity. as mentioned in the introduc-
tion, the homogeneity properties of the prepotential together with the stabilization equations
imply that the entropy should take the form (1.3), and hence terms containing odd powers of
the charges cannot be present in the entropy formula.

another reason why this sub-subleading term is troublesome is that the approaches of [2] and
[3] seem to give a slightly dierent numerical value for this term. namely, when substituting
the hodge numbers of s into the entropy formula [3]

smicro = 2q 1

6|q0|(beven(s) + 1

2 bodd(s)) ,

(3.32)

where beven(s) and bodd(s) denote the sums of the even and of the odd betti numbers, respec-
tively, we obtain (3.31) but with a 6 instead of a 4 in the last term. note that for generic
threefolds, where h1,0(s) = 0, both approaches [2, 3] yield (3.30).
how is the zero-mode counting for k3 t 2 to be modied in order to remove the inconsistencies
mentioned above? let us recall that there are b1 = 2h1,0(s) = 2 nondynamical gauge elds
present. if we assume that the zero-modes are charged and couple to these gauge elds, then
the following mechanism suggests itself. due to gauge invariance, the number of left- and
right-moving scalar elds is reduced by two, so that the number of right-moving scalar elds
is indeed a multiple of four. due to supersymmetry this must be accompanied by the removal
of four right-moving fermionic real degrees of freedom.
if, in addition, we assume that the
removal of fermionic degrees of freedom is left-right symmetric, then the actual number of left-
moving fermionic degrees of freedom is zero. the central charge in the left-moving sector is now
computed to be cl = s3 +c2s = 3 cab papbp1 +24 p1, which is odd in the charges. the resulting
microscopic entropy formula is then in full agreement with the macroscopic computation, which
we now briey describe.

let us analyze the same system from the supergravity point of view. the wilsonian action
controlling the vector multiplet sector of an n = 2 compactication and the relevant n = 2
subsector of an n = 4 compactication is encoded in the holomorphic function

f (y, ) =  1

where the rst formula refers to the generic case, whereas the second formula refers to a com-
pactication on k3  t 2. in the latter case y a/y 0 are the complexied kahler moduli of an
algebraic k3 and y 1/y 0 is the complexied kahler modulus of t 2.

since the function (3.33) represents the leading part of the holomorphic function in the -
expansione, we briey discuss under which conditions a solution based on this function can be
reliable [14, 2]. the issue of -corrections is not quite the same for compactications on generic
threefolds and for compactications on k3  t 2. for generic threefolds, which lead to n = 2
compactications, both the prepotential f (y,  = 0) and the c 2-coupling function f receive
-corrections. in contrast the metric on the n = 4 moduli space and, hence, the prepotential
f (y,  = 0) in the n = 2 subsector of an n = 4 compactication, do not receive -corrections.
however the gravitational c 2-coupling function f does get corrected [23]. therefore (3.33) is
valid for both n = 2 and n = 4 compactications in the limit of large kahler moduli, only. in
particular the kahler moduli im(y a/y 0) must take large positive values at the event horizon.
since the kahler moduli are space dependent for a generic extremal four-dimensional black hole
solution, the geometry of the internal manifold will change accordingly over space. the values
of the moduli at the event horizon are xed by the stabilization equations. for a black hole with
non-vanishing charges q0, pa we have [1]

= ipas

6|q0|

cbcd pbpcpd + c2b pb .

(3.34)

y a

y 0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)horizon

thus, in order to guarantee im y a/y 0|horizon  0 we need to impose |q0|  pa > 0. in fact we
will impose the stronger condition |q0|  pa  0 in order to make contact with the microscopic
entropy counting.

from the microscopic point of view the charges pa are the expansion coecients of the divisor
s in the homology basis, s = paa. by poincare duality there is a dual (1, 1)-form paa,
where a belong to the basis of h 2(x, z) introduced above. the kahler form of the internal
threefold is proportional to im(y a/y 0)a. note that the stabilization equations (3.34) imply
that the kahler form, evaluated with the values that the kahler moduli take at the horizon,
is proportional to the poincare dual of s. if all pa are positive, the (1, 1)-form paa lays in
the interior of the kaher cone and this provides a link between suppression of  corrections
and s being a very ample divisor. namely, by multiplying the (1, 1)-form with a large positive
number or, equivalently, by taking the pa very large, we can arrange that paa is far away
from the boundaries of the kahler cone. in terms of homology pa > 0 implies that the divisor
s has positive intersection numbers with all complex submanifolds of x. this shows that s is
a so-called ample divisor according to the nakai-moishezon criterion. by denition a divisor is
called ample if it can be made very ample by multiplying it with a suciently large positive
number. thus s is ample if pa > 0 and very ample if pa  0. as we explained above one has
to require that s is very ample in order to be able to reliably compute the microscopic entropy.

we now turn to the macroscopic entropy of a black hole with non-vanishing charges q0 and pa,
which can be computed by substituting the function (3.33) into the general formula (1.1). in the
case of a generic threefold the resulting expression for the macroscopic entropy fully agrees with

ein the m-theory picture -corrections appear as instanton corrections corresponding to wrapped m-branes.

for convenience we will use the type-iia picture in the following.

13

the microscopic formula (3.30), as we already showed in [1]. for the case of a compactication
on k3  t 2 we nd

(3.35)

smacro = 2r 1

6|q0|(cid:16)3 cab papb p1 + 24 p1(cid:17) .

this too is in full agreement with the microscopic computation provided that the zero-mode
counting for k3  t 2 is modied as described above.

4 a non-perturbative example

let us now consider an extension of the heterotic-like model of section 2, where the term pro-
portional to  is replaced by a more general function of s = iy 1/y 0,

f (y, ) = 

y 1y aaby b

y 0

+ f (1)(s)  ,

(4.1)

where ab is dened as before. in section 2 we noted that the dilaton and the black hole entropy
depended only on combinations of the electric and magnetic charges that are invariant under
classical (i.e., continuous) target-space duality transformations. for the extension discussed
here, target-space duality remains realized, so we will rst analyze this aspect in some more
detail. subsequently we will consider the possible invariance under s-duality.

first of all, the invariance under the so(1, n  2) subgroup of the target-space duality group is
manifest, as this is an invariance of (4.1). the transformations that extend this subgroup to the
full so(2, n  1) group of target-space dualities depend on 2n  1 parameters, which we write
as two vectors aa and ba and a scalar c under the subgroup. the charges mi and n i transform
under the corresponding innitesimal transformations according to

m0 = c m0 + ba ma ,
m1 = c m1  1
2 ab aa mb ,
ma = aa m0  2ab ba m1 ,

n 0 = c n 0  aa n a ,
n 1 = c n 1 + 2ab ba n b ,
n a = ba n 0 + 1

2 ab ab n 1 .

(4.2)

using that the vectors (y 0, f1, y 2, . . . , y n) and (f0,y 1, f2, . . . , fn) transform as n i and mi
under target-space duality [24, 25], the corresponding transformations of y i and fi are given
by

y 0 = c y 0  aa y a ,
y 1 = c y 1 + 1
y a = ba y 0 + 1

2 ab aa fb ,
2 ab ab f1 ,

f0 = c f0 + ba fa ,
f1 = c f1 + 2ab ba y b ,
fa = aa f0 + 2ab ba y 1 .

(4.3)

the crucial obervation is now that s is invariant under the above transformations of the y i ,
whereas these transformations induce the correct transformations on the derivatives fi as spec-
ied above. this means that the continuous so(2, n  1) transformations are preserved for any
function f of the type given in (4.1). this explains the manifest target-space duality invariance
of the expressions found in section 2.

14

we now proceed and analyze the behaviour under s-duality. in general it is not known which
subset of the s-duality transformations will be realized in n = 2 heterotic string compacti-
cations. but we consider this option, rst as an example to appreciate the relevance of the
non-holomorphic corrections for the entropy formula, and secondly with an eye towards the
n = 4 theory of which the n = 2 theory is just a truncation. on the electric and the magnetic
charges, the s-duality transformations act according to

mi  mi = a mi  2 b ij n j ,

n i  n i = d n i  1

2 c ij mj ,

(4.4)

where the parametes a, b, c and d are integers satisfying ad  bc = 1, and where the symmetric
matrix ij and its inverse ij are dened by

ij n i n j = n 0n 1 + abn an b ,

ij mi mj = 4m0m1 + abmamb .

(4.5)

the above expressions are equal to two of the so(2, n  1) invariants, 1
dened in (2.10). under s-duality the three invariants transform according to

2hn, ni and 2hm, mi,

hm, mi  a2 hm, mi + b2 hn, ni  2 ab m  n ,
hn, ni  c2 hm, mi + d2 hn, ni  2 cd m  n ,
m  n  achm, mi  bdhn, ni + (ad + bc) m  n .

the quantities y i and fi transform as

y 0  y 0 = d y 0 + c y 1 ,
y 1  y 1 = a y 1 + b y 0 ,
y a  y a = d y a  1

2 c ab fb ,

f0  f0 = a f0  b f1 ,
f1  f1 = d f1  c f0 ,
fa  fa = a fa  2 b ab y b .

(4.6)

(4.7)

as a result of these transformations one easily veries that s transforms according to the well-
known sl(2) formula,

s  s =

a s  ib
ic s + d

.

(4.8)

however, in this case the transformations of the fi are not, in general, correctly induced by the
transformations of the y i . this is only the case when

f ( s) = (ic s + d)2 f (s) ,

(4.9)

where f (s) = i f (1)(s)/s. this implies that f (s) must transform under s-duality trans-
formations as a modular form of weight 2.

in heterotic-like string compactications, the wilsonian coupling function f (1)(s) has an expan-
sion of the type f (1)(s) = ic1 s + f (q), where f (q) denotes a series expansion in positive powers
of q = exp(2s) and c1 is the constant appearing in (2.1) (actually, in n = 2 heterotic string
compactications the function f will in general also receive perturbative corrections which de-
pend on the moduli t a = iy a/y 0. here we do not discuss these perturbative corrections).
it is well known that there is no such holomorphic f (1)(s) satisfying (4.9). thus, there is no
holomorphic wilsonian coupling function consistent with s-duality. this, however, does not
pose a problem, since in the presence of massless elds the wilsonian coupling functions do

15

not, in general, exhibit all the invariances of the physical eective coupling functions. in order
to obtain a coupling function that is consistent with (4.9), we have to give up holomorphicity,
which is a characteristic feature of wilsonian couplings, and assume that f (1) depends both
on s and on s.
in doing so, we can still preserve the stabilization equations (where the fi
remain given by f/y i ) and moreover the (classical) target-space duality invariance remains
intact. a non-holomorphic f (1)(s, s) which satises (4.9) and which in the weak coupling limit
 (cid:0)log 2(s) + log(s + s)(cid:1),
re s   turns into f (1)(s, s)  ic1 s is given by f (1)(s, s) = ic1
so that f (s, s) = isf (1)(s, s) = c1
2 g2(s, s), where g2(s, s) = g2(s)  2/(s + s) and
[23]). we should stress here that f (1) is only determined
g2(s) = 4 s log (s) (see, e.g.
up to an anti-holomorphic function of s, which we suppressed in view of the fact that it should
vanish for weak coupling. thus, a function f which is consistent with s-duality is given by (4.1)
with f (1)(s) replaced by f (1)(s, s). we note that f (1)(s, s) is not invariant under (4.8), but
rather transforms as f (1)(s, s)  f (1)(s, s) + ic1
let us now turn to the entropy calculation using the same denitions for the stabilization
equation and the entropy as before, but now with f (1)(s) replaced by f (1)(s, s). first we
determine |z|2 = pi fi (y, y , )  qi y i . by following the same steps as in section 2 we obtain
(4.10)

 log(ic s + d).

6

3

6

|z|2 = (s + s)h 1

2 hn, ni + (f (s, s)  + h.c.)i ,

which reduces to (2.6) in the weak coupling limit re s  . the value of the dilaton s at the
horizon is, in principle, determined in terms of the charges mi and n i carried by the black hole
through the stabilization equations (1.4). again, following the very same steps as in section 2,
we nd

s s hn, ni = hm, mi  2(s + s)(f (s, s) s  + h.c.) ,
(s  s)hn, ni = 2i m  n + 2 (s + s) (f (s, s)   h.c.) .

these two equations are combined into

f (s, s)  = 1
4

1

(s + s)2 (mi  2i s ik n k) ij (mj  2i s jln l) .

(4.11)

(4.12)

note that this equation should not be regarded as the solution for the function f (s, s) but
rather as an equation that determines s in terms of the charges. it is clear that this equation is
consistent with the required s-duality transformation of f (s, s), since

s + s 
mi + 2i s ik n k 

s + s
|ics + d|2 ,
mi + 2i s ik n k

ics + d

,

(4.13)

under the transformations (4.4) and (4.8). using (4.12) the expression for |z|2 takes a very
simple form,

|z|2 =

(mi + 2i s ik n k) ij (mj  2i s jln l)

2(s + s)

,

(4.14)

whose invariance under s-duality is manifest.

16

using the result for f (1) with the non-holomorphic corrections included, one evaluates the
expression for the entropy. as it turns out, the result is not invariant under s-duality, which
forces us to include an extra term. thus, not only does the symplectic vector (y i , fi (y, y , ))
receive non-holomorphic corrections, but there is an additional non-holomorphic correction to
the coupling function of the c 2

coupling function is given by f (1)(s, s) + i c1
invariant expression for the entropy then reads (with  = 64)

we should stress here that the rst term does implicitly depend on the function f (s, s) through
the solution of (4.12) for s.

the above n = 2 example can be viewed as describing an n = 2 subsector of the eective
lagrangian of heterotic string theory compactied on a six-torus. we already discussed this
truncation in section 2. hence (4.15) can be promoted to an n = 4 target-space duality
invariant result. this is accomplished by simply replacing the so(2, n  1) invariants bilinear
in the charges by the corresponding so(6, 22) ones. indeed, it is known [23] that the eective
lagrangian of this n = 4 theory possesses a c 2
-term with an eective coupling function
 log(s + s). since the n = 4 theory is conjectured to be invariant
given by f (1)(s, s) + i c1
under s-duality, the black hole entropy in the heterotic n = 4 theory should also be invariant
under strong-weak coupling duality. it would be interesting to make contact between the n = 4
extension of (4.15) and the entropy formula of [26].

the equation (4.12) for s can be solved iteratively order-by-order in . in the case of purely
imaginary s, the solution remains unmodied, that is s = im  n/hn, ni.

5 corrections from t -dependent higher-derivative interaction terms

so far we considered holomorphic functions f (y, ) that depended at most linearly on . in
this section we will study functions that depend more generally on , which we recall, is just
proportional to the square of the auxiliary tensor eld t ab ij which is the lowest component
of the weyl multiplet. more specically, we will consider functions f (y, ) associated with a
type-iia string compactication on a calabiyau threefold. in the limit of large kahler moduli,
the corresponding homogenous holomorphic function is given by

dabc y ay by c

+ da

y a
y 0  + g(y 0, ) ,

(5.1)

where dabc =  1

64 c2a. the coecients cabc denote the intersection
numbers of the four-cycles of the calabi-yau threefold, whereas the coecients c2a denote its
second chern-class numbers. the function g(y 0, ) is proportional to [10]

f (y, ) =

here  is proportional to /y 0. as we shall argue below the proportionality factor relating
g(y 0, ) to i() is given by g(y 0, ) = i/(2(2)3)  (y 0)2 i(), where  denotes the euler
number of the calabi-yau manifold. observe that g satises the homogeneity relation

y 0 g0 + 2 g = 2g ,

(5.3)

where g0 and g denote the derivatives of g with respect to y 0 and , respectively.

an explicit evaluation of the integral (5.2) has been given in two regimes [10], namely one in
which  is taken to be small and the other in which  is taken to be large. when computing
(5.2) a regularisation prescription needs to be adopted. in the case of small , the regularised
expression (5.2) reads [10, 27]

i()reg = xg=0,2,3,...

bg 2g

,

bg = ()g 2(2g  1)

(2g) (3  2g)

(2)2g

.

(5.4)

the coecient b0, in particular, is given by b0 = (3), which shows that the proportionality
factor relating g(y 0, ) to i()reg must be the one mentioned above, since the function f is
known to contain a term i/(2(2)3) (3)  (y 0)2 [28]. we note that, for small , the function
g(y 0, ) is not actually fully captured by (5.4) since there are additional contributions to it
which are not analytic near  = 0 [10].

in a number of cases one can perform explicit calculations and determine the value of the scalar
elds y i (from (1.2)) and of the entropy (from (1.1)) in the presence of a function g(y 0, ).
below we will evaluate the case with p0 = 0 (so that y 0 is real), the case of axion-free black
holes and the case where y 0 is imaginary and thus equal to 1
2 ip0. to facilitate this discussion
we rst collect a number of useful formulae.

first of all, the scalars y a do not appear in the function g, which implies that

fa =

3 dabc y by c + da 

y 0

(5.5)

remains unchanged. therefore the stabilization equations for qa are universal (since these
equations are only valid at the horizon, we have  = 64),

qa =

1

|y 0|2h  da p0   3idabc (y by c y 0  y b y cy 0)i .

(5.6)

the stabilization equation for q0 does depend on the function g and reads

q0 = i

dabc y ay by c + day a 

(y 0)2

dabc y a y b y c + da y a 

( y 0)2

 i

 i(g0  g0) .

(5.7)

furthermore, the expression for |z|2 = pi fi  qi y i can be written as follows,

3 y a y by c

y ay by c y 0

|z|2 = i dabch 3 y ay b y c

s = h|z|2  2ida(cid:16) y a

y 0  

y a
y 0

(cid:17)  2i( g   g)i .

(5.9)

we now turn to the three separate cases.

5.1 black holes with p0 = 0

let us compute the entropy for a class of type-iia black holes with p0 = 0. this implies
immediately that y 0 = y 0. the equation (5.6) then simplies and one establishes directly that

y a = 1

6 y 0dabqb + 1

2 ipa ,

where dab  dabc pc , dabdbc = c
a ,

(5.10)

where we recall that dabc and da are related to the four-cycle intersection numbers and the
second chern-class numbers of an underlying calabi-yau manifold. similarly, one obtains from
(5.7),

4 (y 0)2 =

dabc papbpc  4dapa 

q0 + i(g0  g0)

,

(5.11)

where q0  q0 + 1

12 dab qaqb. furthermore, from (5.8) we determine

|z|2 = 

dabc papbpc  2dapa 

y 0

+ iy 0 (g0  g0) .

combining these results leads to the following equation for the entropy,

s = 4 y 0 q0  i (3y 0 g0 + 2 g  h.c.) .

(5.12)

(5.13)

for vanishing g this result agrees with that given in [1], which was consistent with the results
of state counting presented in [2, 3] in appropriate limits.

equation (5.11) can be solved iteratively for y 0 in terms of the charges, as follows. let us denote
the value of y 0 by y0 when g is switched o. we take the magnetic charges pa to be positive and
q0 < 0, so that (y0)2 > 0, as can be seen from (5.11). in a regime where |im g0(y0, )|  |q0|,
(5.11) can, to rst approximation, be written as

y 0 = y0(cid:16)1 + 1

2

i(g0(y0, )  g0(y0, ))

|q0|

+ (cid:17) .

inserting (5.14) into (5.13) then yields, to rst approximation,

s = 2q 1

6|q0|(cabc papbpc + c2a pa)  2i(g(y0, )  g(y0, )) + 

where we used the homogeneity property (5.3) for g and expressed the result in terms of the
intersection numbers and second chern-class numbers.

(5.14)

(5.15)

5.2 axion-free black holes

now let us consider axion-free black holes, which are characterized by the fact that the moduli
za = y a/y 0 are imaginary. using y 0y a + y 0 y a = 0, it readily follows that

y a = ipa y 0


,

where y 0 = 1

2 ( + ip0) .

the charges qa follow directly from (5.6),

qa = 3 dabc pbpc p0

2  4da

p0 

2 + (p0)2 .

(5.16)

(5.17)

this equation implies that the charges are tightly constrained.
it also implies a quadratic
equation for 2. its solution thus xes all the moduli in terms of the charges. the stabilization
equation (5.7) for q0 shows that q0 is not independent, but given by

qapa + 3q0p0 = dapa 

16 p0

2 + (p0)2  3ip0(g0  g0) .

in this case (5.8) yields

|z|2 = 2 dabc papbpc 2 + (p0)2

3

+ 4 dapa 

2  (p0)2
(2 + (p0)2)

2 i(g0  g0) + 1
+ 1

2 p0(g0 + g0) .

the entropy can be written as follows (with  = 64)
s = h  2 dabc papbpc 2 + (p0)2

3

+ 8 dapa 



2 + (p0)2

for g = ic(y 0)2 and da = 0 this result coincides with that obtained in [14].

2 i(g0  g0) + 1
+ 1

2 p0(g0 + g0)  2i( g  g)i .

(5.18)

(5.19)

(5.20)

5.3 black holes with re y 0 = 0

finally, we consider black holes for which re y 0 = 0 and, hence, y 0 = 1
equations (5.6) and (5.7) yield the following two conditions

2 ip0. the stabilization

p0 qa = 6 dabc (y by c + y b y c)  4da  ,

(p0)2 q0 = 4 dabc pa(y by c + y b y c + y b y c) + 4dapa   i(p0)2 (g0  g0) .
just as in the previous subsection the charge q0 is not independent and is constrained by

p0 pi qi = 2 dabc papbpc  i(p0)2 (g0  g0) .

(5.21)

(5.22)

the equations (5.21) are quadratic in terms of the scalars y a which can therefore be determined
in terms of the charges. however, we do not wish to pursue this in full generality. below we will
determine the value of the y a for type-ii models with a dual heterotic description.

20

from (5.8) and (5.9) we obtain

|z|2 =
s =

2
p0 dabc (y + y )a(y + y )b(y + y )c +
2
p0 dabc(y + y )a(y + y )b(y + y )c  2i(g  g) ,

4
p0 da(y + y )a  + 1

2 p0(g0 + g0) ,

(5.23)

where we made use of the homogeneity property (5.3) for g.

for type-ii models with a dual heterotic description, we can use the rst equation in (5.21) to
determine the the y a, along the same lines as in section 2. we start from

dabc y ay by c = y 1y aaby b ,

day a = c1y 1 ,

(5.24)

so that d1ab =  1

3 ab. then the rst equation in (5.21) yields

y a =

4c1  + p0q1 + paabpb =

1

y 1 + y 1 h 1
(y 1 + y 1)2 h 1

4 p0 abqb + i y 1 pai ,
4 (p0)2 qaabqb + (p1)2paabpb + p0p1 paqai . (5.25)

1

substituting this into the above entropy formula, we obtain

s = 

= 

2



p0(y 1 + y 1)h 1
4 (p0)2 qaabqb + (p1)2paabpb + p0p1 paqai  2i(g  g)
p0r(cid:16)(p0)2qaabqb + 4(p1)2paabpb + 4p0p1qapa(cid:17)(cid:16)q1p0 + paabpb + 4c1(cid:17)
2i(g  g) ,

(5.26)

we thus see that we have to choose p0 < 0. this expression can be rewritten as follows in terms
of the heterotic electric and magnetic charges mi and n i given in section 2,



s = 

p0q((p0)2hm, mi + (p1)2hn, ni + 2p0p1m  n ) (hn, ni + 8c1)
2i(g  g) .

(5.27)

observe that the charges are subject to the constraint (5.22), which in the case at hand reads
p0m  n + p1hn, ni = i(p0)2 (g0  g0). substituting this into (5.27) yields
s = qhm, mihn, ni  (m  n )2  (p0)2(g0  g0)2 s1 

512 c1
hn, ni

(5.28)

2i(g  g) ,

where we also used  = 64. this expression reduces to (2.9) in the case of g = 0.
