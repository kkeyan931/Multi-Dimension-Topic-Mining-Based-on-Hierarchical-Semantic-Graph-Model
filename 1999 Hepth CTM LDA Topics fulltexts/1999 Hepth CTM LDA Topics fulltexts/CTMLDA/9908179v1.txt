abstract

we discuss the construction of baxters q-operator. the sug-
gested approach leads to the one-parametric family of q-operators,
satisfying to the wronslian-type relations. also we have found the
generalization of baxter operators, with denes the nondiagonal part
of the monodromy.

1 introduction.

long ago, considering xy z spin chain baxter[1] has introduced so called q-
operator, which permitted him to nd the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix t(x)
in spite of the absence of bethe ansatz for this spin chain. this object may be
dened by the following operator equation:

t(x)q(x) = a(x)q(x + i) + b(x)q(x  i),

together with the requirements

[t(x), q(y)] = [q(x), q(y)] = 0.

(1)

(2)

recently, in the series of papers bazhanov, lukyanov and zamolodchikov [2] have
given an explicit construction of such operators for the case of certain integrable
eld model. moreover their construction denitely gives the pair the of operators
q(x), satisfying apart from (1) and (2) also

[q+(x), q(y)] = 0

(3)

and certain wronskian relation. which becomes the origin of the various fusion
relations.

however, the extension of their results for six-vertex spin chain requires an
external magnetic eld which cannot be eliminated by limiting procedure. there-
fore in the simplest case of xxx spin chain we do not know q(x) -operators,

1

though from the point of view of quantum inverse scattering method (qism) [3]
their construction should be universal for any integrable system. in [4] we inves-
tigated the equation (1) for the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix in the cases of
xxx and xxz and had proven that there exists a pair of solutions (we called
it q(x) and p (x)) which are the polynomials (or trigonometric polynomials for
xxz case) in spectral parameter and which also satises wronskian relations.
in the present paper we give the explicit operator construction of the one-
parametric solution of the equation (1) and also the solutions of generalized equa-
tion, where instead of the transfer matrix enters the whole monodromy matrix.
to simplify the discussion we shall consider the case of quantum spin 1/2. the
generalization for arbitrary quantum spin as well as for inhomogeneous chain are
more or less straightforward.

in the frameworks of qism [3], the monodromy matrix t l(x) is dened as the
ordered product of l - operators, acting in the 2  (2l + 1) - dimensional space:

ll

n = x + 2isa

nla,

(4)

n are the operators of quantum spin 1/2, while la operators, acting in
where sa
the auxiliary 2l + 1 - dimensional space. the monodromy matrix is then given
by

t l(x) =

ll(x),

n

yn=1

(5)

where n- is the length of the chain and the transfer matrix tl(x) is the trace of
t l(x) over the auxiliary space:

tl(x) = t rt l(x).

(6)

note that for the case isotropic xxx - spin chain, the monodromy matrix t l(x)
is the scalar with respect to simultaneous rotation in the quantum and auxiliary
spaces

[~s + ~l, t l(x)] = 0,

(7)

(8)

where

~s =

n=1

xn

~sn.

therefore the transfer matrix tl(x) is the scalar with respect to quantum spin:

[~s, tl(x)] = 0.

(9)

the full set of commutation relations between matrix elements of the monodromy
matrix with dierent spectral parameters is contained in the following equation
[3]:

rl,l

(x  y)t l(x)t l

(y) = t l

(y)t l(x)rl,l

(x  y),

(10)

2

where the monodromies t l(x) and t l(y) have common quantum space and dier-
ent auxiliary spaces. the r-matrix, which acts in the tensor product of auxiliary
spaces with dimension (2l + 1)  (2l + 1) is the function of total auxiliary spin
~j = ~l + ~l [3]:

rl,l

(x) = eij (j + 1  ix)
(j + 1 + ix)

,

where the operator j is given by:

the same commutation relations, as (10) are valid also for l-operators:

j = (cid:16) ~j 2 + 1/4(cid:17)1/2

 1/2.

rl,l

(x  y)ll(x)ll

(y) = ll

(y)ll(x)rl,l

(x  y),

(11)

(12)

(13)

the equation (10) has many important corollaries, among which there are so
called fusion relations. the later plays the key role in what follows. one of these
fusion relation for transfer matrix has the following form:

t1/2(x)tl(x+i(l+1/2)) = (x+

i
2

)n tl+1/2(x+il)+(x

i
2

)n tl1/2(x+i(l+1)). (14)

if we denote as a(x, l) the transfer matrix with shifted spectral parameter

a(x, l) = tl(x + i(l + 1/2)),

(15)

the relation (14) will take the form

t1/2(x)a(x, l) = (x +

i
2

)n a(x  i, l + 1/2) + (x 

i
2

)n a(x + i, l  1/2),

(16)

which is very similar to the dening relation for baxter q- operator in the case
of xxx spin chain [4]:

t1/2(x)q(x) = (x +

i
2

)n q(x  i) + (x 

i
2

)n q(x + i).

(17)

the dierence of (16) and (17) is due to the shift of second argument of a(x, l) in
the r.h.s. of (16). to eliminate this dierence we shall make the following trick.
let us forget for a moment that l denotes the representation of auxiliary spin,
and takes only integer or half-integer values and consider a(x, l) as a function of
two complex arguments. then the new function, which is dened as

q(x, l) = a(x, l + ix/2)

(18)

apparently satises the relation

t1/2(x)q(x, l) = (x +

i
2

)n q(x  i, l) + (x 

i
2

)n q(x + i, l).

(19)

3

in such a way we obtain a one parametric family of operators, satisfying
baxter equation (17). of course, this construction can not be considered as
rigorous, because the analytic continuation from countable set of points into
complex plane is not unique and we have used this trick only to illustrate the idea.
in what follows we shall give more educated construction of the q-operator, based
on this idea. however, if we impose the condition, that after the continuation
into complex l-plane, the operator a(x, l) remains polynomial in l, then this
continuation becomes unique and this trick gives the eective way for calculation
of eigenvalues of the q-operators via the eigenvalues of the monodromies tl(x).

2 the l-operators

the discussion of the previous section made it clear that for the construction of
the q-operator we need the complex spin in the auxiliary space. also, we shall
look for the q-operator in the form of the trace of appropriate modoromy:

q(x) = t r q(x),

(20)

where the operator q(x) acts in the tensor product of quantum space of s = 1/2
and innite dimensional auxiliary space . as we shall see for our purpose it is
sucient that this space  is the representation of the algebra:

[i, +

j ] = ij,

i, j = 1, 2

the operator q(x) will be given by the ordered product:

q(x) =

n

yn=1

ln(x),

(21)

(22)

where ln(x)-are the operators, depending on  and + and acting in the space
of n-th quantum spin.

further we shall need to consider the product (cid:16)l1/2

ln(x), which acts
in the auxiliary space   2 ( - for ln(x) and 2 - is two-dimensional auxiliary
space for l1/2
n (x)). in this space it is convenient to consider a pair of projectors

ij:

n (x)(cid:17)ij

+


ij = (+ + 1)1i+
ij = (+ + 1)1il+

j = i+
l jmm = il+

j (+ + 1)1,

l jmm(+ + 1)1,

where

+ = +

i i
ij = ji,

12 = 1.

4

(23)

(24)

these projectors formally satisfy the following relations:

ik

+
ik
ij + 

kj = 
ij,
kj = 0,
ij = ij.

+

(25)

rigorously speaking the r.h.s. of the rst equation (25) in the fock representation
has an extra term, proportional to the projector on the vacuum state, but, as we
shall see below, this term is irrelevant in the present discussion.

in order to dene q - operator which satises baxter equation (17) we shall
exploit baxters idea [1], which we reformulate as following: ln(x)-operator should
satises the relation:

if this condition is fullled, then



ij(cid:16)l1/2

n (x)(cid:17)jl

ln(x)+

lk = 0.

(26)

(27)

ln(x)+

lj +

ln(x)
lj.

(cid:16)l1/2
n (x)(cid:17)ij
ik(cid:16)l1/2(x)n(cid:17)kl



ik(cid:16)l1/2
ik(cid:16)l1/2

n (x)(cid:17)kl
n (x)(cid:17)kl

ln(x) = +

ln(x)

lj + +

in other words, the condition (26) guaranties that the r.h.s. of (27) in the sense of
projectors  has the triangle form and this form will be conserved for products
over n due to orthogonality of the projectors.

from (26) we obtain

jmm(cid:16)xjk + isa
jk(cid:17) ln(x)k = 0,
na
na

kl  kl] lan(x)

ln(x)k = [isa

or

and

(28)

(29)

(30)

jmmhxjk  isa
jki ln(x) = bn(x)kll,
na

where an(x) and bn(x) are some operators which we shall nd now. making use
of (29) let us rewrite the rst term in the r.h.s. of (27) in the following form:

+

ik(cid:16)l1/2

n (x)(cid:17)kl

ln(x)+

lj = (x + i/2)(x  3i/2)ian(x)+

j (+ + 1)1

this equation may also be written as

+

ik(cid:16)l1/2

n (x)(cid:17)kl

ln(x)+

lj = (x + i/2)iln(x  i)+

j (+ + 1)1,

provided the operator an(x) is given by

an(x) = (x  3i/2)1ln(x).

5

(31)

(32)

(33)

substituting (33) into (29) we obtain the desired equation for l operator:

ij + ixij(cid:17) jln(x) = (1/2 + ix)ln(x + i)i.
(cid:16)sa
na

if this equation is satised, we immediately nd the operator bn(x) in (30):

bn(x) = (x  i/2)ln(x + i).

(34)

(35)

having (35) we can also rewrite the second term in the r.h.s. of (27), as we did
in the equation (32) and nally arrive at

(cid:16)l1/2
n (x)(cid:17)ij

ln(x) = (x + i/2)iln(x  i)+

j (+ + 1)1
n (x)(cid:17)kl
ik(cid:16)l1/2

+(x  i/2)(+ + 1)1il+

l ln(x + i)jmm + +

ln(x)
lj

.(36)

we do not care to rewrite the last term in the r.h.s. of (36) because this term
does not contribute into the nal expression of q-operator.

until now our discussion was quite formal because we did not specify the
representation of the algebra (21). the detailed investigation of the equation (34)
shows that the usual fock representation for (21) does not t for our purpose,
therefore we shall use less restrictive holomorphic representation.

let the operator +

i be the operator of multiplication by the i, while the

operator i-the operator of dierentiation with respect to i:

+
i () = i(),

i() =




().

the operators +

i , i are canonically conjugated for the scalar product:

(, ) = z qi=1,2 did i

(2i)2

e  ()()

(37)

(38)

the action of an operator in holomorphic representation is dened by its kernel:

(k) () = z d(, )k(, )(),

where we have denoted

d(, ) = qi=1,2 did i

(2i)2

.

(39)

(40)

in this frameworks we can formulate the following

theorem the kernel of the operator ln(x) , satisfying equation (34) in holo-

morphic representation has the following form:

ln(x, l, , ) = (cid:20)x +

i
2

(+ + 1) + isa

n+a(cid:21)

( )2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

,

(41)

6

where l is arbitrary number.

the proof is trivial by direct substitution of (41) into (34), using the denition
(39). in such a way, the operator ln(x) given by (41) solves the equation (36) for
left multiplication by l1/2(x). changing the order of the multiplication in (36),
we can prove that

ln(x)(cid:16)l1/2

n (x)(cid:17)ij
l ln(x + i)jmm(+ + 1)1 + 

= (x + i/2)(+ + 1)1iln(x  i)+
j

+(x  i/2)il+

ik(cid:16)l1/2

n (x)(cid:17)kl

provided ln(x) satises the equation:

ln(x)+

i (cid:16)sa
ij + ixij(cid:17) = (1/2 + ix)+
na

j ln(x + i).

ln(x)+
lj

,(42)

(43)

the direct substitution of (41) into (43) shows that (41) is the solution also of this
equation. the solution (41) possesses the invariance with respect to simultaneous
rotation in quantum and auxiliary spaces, as an l-operator of xxx chain:

[~sn + + ~
2

, ln(x)] = 0.

(44)

3 the q-operators

.

to proceed further we need to remind the denition of trace of an operator in
holomorphic representation. if the operator is given by its kernel f (, ) then,
(see e.g. [5])

t rf = z d(, )f (, ),

(45)

where the measure was dened in (40). let us now consider the ordered product
of the ln(x)-operators, introduced in the previous section

q(x, l, , ) = z

n 1

yi=1

d(i, i)ln (x, l, , n 1)ln 1(x, l, n 1, n 2)    

    l2(x, l, 2, 1)l1(x, l, 1, ).

(46)

due to triangle (in the sense of projectors  ) structure of the r.h.s. of (36) we
obtain the following rule of multiplication of the monodromy matrix t 1/2(x) on
operator q:

q(x, l, , ) = (x + i

(cid:16)t 1/2(x)(cid:17)ij

(x  i

2)n (+ + 1)1im+

m

2 )n i q(x  i, l, , )+
q(x + i, l, , )jkk + +

j (+ + 1)1

im(  )mk
kj,

(47)

7

where we omitted the explicit expression of the last term by obvious reasons.
in the derivation of (47) we have used the remnants of the projectors  which
govern the proper multiplication of each term in (36) separately.

now we can perform the trace operation over the holomorphic variables and
over i, j indexes, corresponding to the auxiliary 2-dimensional space of t 1/2(x).
the result is the desired baxter equation:

t1/2(x)q(x, l) = (x +

i
2

)n q(x  i, l) + (x 

i
2

)n q(x + i, l),

(48)

where, according to (45) and (46)

q(x, l) = z d(, ) q(x, l, , ).

(49)

note, that the trace of q exists due to the exponential factor in holomorphic
measure (40) and has cyclic property, therefore q(x, l) is invariant under cyclic
permutation of the quantum spins. further, due to property (44) we easily obtain
that q(x, l) is invariant with respect to rotations of the total quantum spin:

[~s, q(x, l)] = 0,

(50)

where ~s is given in (8).

recall, that ln(x)-operators satisfy also the relation (42) for the right multi-

plication by l1/2(x), therefore

[t(x), q(x, l)] = 0.

(51)

the expression (46) for the q-operator could be essentially simplied. for

that let us rewrite the equation (41) in the following form:

ln(x, l, , ) = kn(x)

( )2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

,

where we have denoted via kn(x) the following operator:

kn(x) = x +

i
2

(+ + 1) + isa

n+a.

(52)

(53)

here , +-are the operators, acting in (52) on the variable . the action of the
operator ln(x) in the form (52) on the function , according to (39) has the
following form:

(ln(x)) () = z d(, )kn(x)

( )2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

().

(54)

8

using property of the measure d(, ) we can transfer the action of the operator
kn(x) from the variable i onto the variable i and rewrite (54) in the form:

(ln(x)) () = z d(, )

( )2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

kn(x)().

(55)

proceeding this way in the representation (46) we can collect all operators kn(x)
in one place:

q(x, l, , ) = z
yi=1
ym=1



n

n 1

d(i, i)

(n 1)2l+ix(n 1n 2)2l+ix    (21)2l+ix

[(2l + ix + 1]n 1

km(x)

(1

)2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

.

(56)

now all operators km(x) act on the variable 1, and we can perform integration
over k, k with k = 2,    , n  1. this integration could be done with the help
of the following formula:

z d(, )

()2l+ix( )2l+ix
[(2l + ix + 1)]2 =

( )2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

.

(57)

from (57) follows that the factor ( )u/(u + 1) is actually the kernel of some
projector. using this property, we arrive at the following representation for q:

q(x, l, , ) = z d(, )

()2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

n

ym=1

km(x)

( )2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

.

(58)

due to the fact that in (58) the ordered product of kn(x) acts only on the variable
i , we can derive the expression for trace of q(x, l, , ), performing one more
integration:

q(x, l) = z d(, )

n

ym=1

km(x)

()2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

(59)

needless to say that for integer or half-integer l and x = 0 the expression
( )2l/(2l + 1) coincides with the kernel of the projector on the representation l
of su(2), so that the equation (59)is actually the desired prescription for analytic
continuation into complex momentum, naively suggested in the introduction.

4 the intertwining relations.

in this section we shall derive several intertwining relations for the operators
ln(x) and l1/2(x) which permit us to prove the commutativity of q(x, l) and
some other important corollaries. first of all let us consider the representation
(52) for ln(x) -operator. the formal operator kn(x), which enters into this

9

representation is nothing else, but usual ln(x)-operator of xxx -spin chain
with innite dimensional auxiliary space, with shifted spectral parameter. the
shift commutes with kn(x), so we can prove pure algebraically the r-matrix form
of commutation relation for kn(x):

i
r, (cid:18)x  y +
2
n(y)k 

= k 

(+   + )(cid:19) k 
n(x)r, (cid:18)x  y +

n(y) =

n(x)k 
i
(+   + )(cid:19) ,
2

where r, (x) is given by equation (11) with

~j = + ~
2

 +  + ~
2

.

(60)

(61)

the indexes  and  at the operators kn and r indicate dierent operators,
acting in their auxiliary spaces. for the products of l-operators equation (60)
implies

i

r, (cid:18)x  y +
n(y)k

(62)

few comments should be made to this equations. the holomorphic variables,
corresponding to the pair of operators +,  are ,  , to the pair  +,   , .
the equations (62) should be understood as the short version of the long story
with integrals over the holomorphic variables with the functions, depending upon
, . the last step of the chain of the equations is due to the same property of
measure, which permitted the transition from (54) to (55).

coming back to the l operators we can write the following intertwining rela-

tion:

r, (x  y +

i
2

(+   + ))ln(x, l, , )ln(y, m, , ) =

ln(y, m, , )ln(x, l, , )r, (x  y +

i
2

(+   + ))

(63)

apparently, the same relation holds true also for q- operators. from that we
immediately obtain the commutativity of its traces:

[q(x, l), q(y, m)] = 0

(64)

10

further, let us consider another commutation relation [6] :

(x +

i
2
= (y  x + i~2 ~m )(y + i~1 ~m )(x +

~1~2)(y + i~1 ~m )(y  x + i~2 ~m)
i
2

~1~2),

(65)

where the pauly matrices a
satisfying

1 , a

2 acts in their spaces and m a are some operators

in particular, we can set

[m a, m b] = iabcm c.

m a = + ~
2

,

(66)

(67)

where +,  the heisenberg variables (21). now let us shift the spectral parameter
y in (65) by i/2(+ + 1) and rewrite (65) in the following form:

(x + i~~sn)(cid:16)y + i
= (cid:16)y  x + i

2(+ + 1) + i~sn+~(cid:17)(cid:16)y  x + i

2 (cid:17)
2(+ + 1) + i~+ ~
2(+ + 1) + i~sn+~(cid:17) (x + i~~sn) ,

2 (cid:17)(cid:16)y + i

2 (+ + 1) + i~+ ~

(68)

where we interpret ~1 as quantum spin ~sn while the ~2 serves as auxiliary spin.
equation (68) could be also written as

(cid:16)l1/2
n (x)(cid:17)ik

kn(y)(cid:18)k(y  x +

i
2

)(cid:19)kj

= (cid:18)k(y  x +

i
2

)(cid:19)ik

kn(y)(cid:16)l1/2

n (x)(cid:17)kj

,

(69)
where we explicitly wrote the indexes, corresponding to the auxiliary space, index
n indicates corresponding quantum space and the operator k(x) was introduced
in (53).

the equation (69) could be used for derivation of the intertwining relation
for l1/2 and l operators. indeed, let use consider the following product of the
operators, acting of the function in holomorphic representation

 (cid:16)l1/2

n (x)(cid:17)ik
= (cid:16)l1/2

ln(y, l)kkj(y  x +

n (x)(cid:17)ikz d(, )kn(y)

)!()
( )2l+iy

(2l + iy + 1)

kkj(y  x +

i
2

)(). (70)

moving the operator kkj(y  x + i/2) to the left, through the projector
( )2l+iy/(2l + iy + 1) and using (69) we obtain the following relation:

n (x)(cid:17)ik
(cid:16)l1/2

ln(y, l)kkj(y  x +

i
2

) = kik(y  x +

i
2

)ln(y, l)(cid:16)l1/2

n (x)(cid:17)kj

, (71)

11

where the operator

kij(x) = (cid:18)x +

i
2

(+ + 1)(cid:19) ij + i~ij+ ~

(72)

plays the role of r-matrix.

the relation (71) gives rise to the analogous relation for the monodromies:

(cid:16)t 1/2(x)(cid:17)ik

q(y, l, , )kkj(y  x +

) = kik(y  x +

from where we obtain the commutativity of the transfer matrix and our q- op-
erator:

[t(x), q(y, l)] = 0.

5 again q-operators

now we are ready to discuss some important properties of baxters q- opera-
tor and it generalizations. let us start from the baxter equation (48) for the
q-operator. due to mutual commutativity of q(x, l) with dierent spectral pa-
rameters and second arguments, we easily derive that

i

"(cid:18)x 

i

2(cid:19)n
= "(cid:18)x 

q(x  i, l) (cid:18)x +
2(cid:19)n

2(cid:19)n
q(x  i, m) (cid:18)x +

q(x + i, l)# q(x, m)
2(cid:19)n

q(x + i, m)# q(x, l),

, m)  q(x 

i

, l)q(x +

i
2

, m) = c(l, m)xn ,

(76)

where c(l, m) is some unknown operator, commuting with q. to nd c(l, m) we
must calculate the l.h.s. of (76) for some convenient values of arguments. from
(59) follows that the q- operator is proportional to the trace of the projector,
whose kernel in the holomorphic representation is ()2l+ix/(2l + ix + 1). this
trace is given by:

z d()

()2l+ix

(2l + ix + 1)

= 2(2l + ix + 1).

(77)

note , that for x = 0, the trace is 2 dimension of the representation of spin l.
from (77) we conclude that

q(x, l)|ix=(2l+1) = 0.

(78)

12

now let us set x = i(2l+1/2) in the equation (76) (for m, l- integer or half-integer
and m  l + 1/2). then, due to (78) the rst term in l.h.s. of (76) disappears
and we obtain:

 q(2il, l)q(i(2l + 1), m) = c(l, m)[i(2l + 1)]n

further, from (59) we derive that

q(2il, l) = t0(i(2l + 1)) = [i(2l + 1)]n

and

q(i(2l + 1)) = tml1/2(i(l + m)).

hence, the unknown coecient c(l, m) is given by

c(l, m) = tml1/2(i(l + m)).

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

for the case l  m+ 1/2 , we should put x = i(2m+ 1/2) and l and m will change
their places in the nal answer. so, nally we obtain the quantum wronskian in
the following form:

q(x +

i
2

, l)q(x 

i
2

, m)  q(x 

i
2

, l)q(x +

i
2

, m) = xn tml1/2(i(l + m)). (83)

note, that for l = m, the r.h.s. of (83) vanishes, as it should be for wronskian of
a linearly dependent solutions.

proceeding along this way we can obtain the general relation involving the
transfer matrix with arbitrary spin in the auxiliary space in the r.h.s. of (83) (the
xn is just the to(x)) (see [2],[4]). we postpone the discussion of these relation for
the future publication, where we intend to give another its derivation .

further we want to consider the generalization of baxter equation, which
follows from the fundamental relation (47). to obtain these new relations, let us
multiply both sides of (47) by total spin in the auxiliary space:

(87)

if we now shall calculate the trace over the whole auxiliary space, the last term in
the r.h.s. of (87) again will not contribute, as it was in the case of usual baxter
equation and we obtain the following relation:

~t1/2(x)q(x, l) + t1/2(x) ~q(x, l) = (x +

)n ~q(x  i, l) + (x 

i
2

)n ~q(x + i, l), (88)

i

where we have introduced the notations:

~t1/2(x) = t r

~
2

t 1/2(x)

~q(x, l) = z d(, ) ~j q(x, l, , )

(89)

this equation may be considered as inhomogeneous baxter equation, where the
rst term in the l.h.s. plays the role of inhomogeneity. remarkably, that the r.h.s.
of (89) will not change if we simultaneously will change the order of multiplication
in both terms in the l.h.s.:

q(x, l)~t1/2(x) + ~q(x, l)t1/2(x) = (x +

)n ~q(x  i, l) + (x 

i
2

)n ~q(x + i, l). (90)

i

this property could by derived either from equation (47), repeating all steps,
which lead us to (88) or directly from intertwining relation (73). these new
vector q-operators inherit many properties of the original baxter operator. in
particularly, they also satisfy the wronskian-type relations, similar to (83). we
intend to present the detailed discussion of these operators in separate publi-
cation.
it worth to mention that we can go further, multiplying the equation

14

(47) by products of the generators of total auxiliary spin. the relations (86)
and triangle structure of the r.h.s. of (47) guaranties that the last term will not
contribute and we shall obtain the relations, similar to the (90) for new tensorial
generalizations of the q-operator. also, multiplying both sides of (47) by the
operator

~
2

u( ~h) = exp i ~h(

+ ~j),

(91)

where ~h are c-number, we shall obtain baxters operator for xxx spin chain
in the external magnetic eld.

6 concluding remarks.

the construction of baxters q operator, considered in the present paper for the
case of xxx spin chain seems to be rather universal and could be extended for
the case of anisotropic xxz spin chain. the key for this generalization is again
the naive analytic continuation suggested in the introduction.

indeed, in the baxters parameterization [1], the fusion relation for xxz spin

chain has the following form:

t1/2()tl ( + (2l + 1))

= sinn ( + )tl+1/2( + 2l) + sinn (  )tl1/2( + 2(l + 1)),

(92)

where  is the crossing parameter. from (92) it is clear that the function q(, l),
dened by

q(, l) = tl/4(/2 + (2l + 1))

(93)

satises the relation:

t1/2()q(, l) = sinn ( + )q(  2, l) + sinn (  )q( + 2, l).

(94)

again this trick can not be considered as the construction of the q - operator,
but it gives the strong evidence that the procedure described in the present paper
may be extended for the 6-vertex model. very interesting question is the further
generalization of this approach to the case of 8-vertex spin chain, for which there
exists also baxter construction [1] and for the case of the eld model considered
in [2].
