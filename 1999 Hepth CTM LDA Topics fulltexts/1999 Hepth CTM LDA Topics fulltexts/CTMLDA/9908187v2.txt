abstract

we nd new duality transformations which allow us to construct the stress tensors
of all the twisted sectors of any orbifold a(h)/h, where a(h) is the set of all current-
algebraic conformal eld theories with a nite symmetry group h  aut(g). the
permutation orbifolds with h = z and h = s3 are worked out in full as illustrations
but the general formalism includes both simple and semisimple g. the motivation for
this development is the recently-discovered orbifold virasoro master equation, whose
solutions are identied by the duality transformations as sectors of the permutation
orbifolds a(d)/z.

1 introduction

recently, an orbifold virasoro master equation (ovme) was found which summarizes the
general virasoro construction1

t (z) =

equation (vme) which summarizes the general ane-virasoro construction35

g at order . the ovme at  = 1 is the virasoro master

t (z) = lab : ja(z)jb(z) :

(1.2)

on ane lie algebra68. the coecients l and l in (1.1) and (1.2) are called inverse inertia
tensors. it was clear for   2 that the ovme collects a large class of stress tensors t of
twisted sectors of orbifolds, but, except in special cases, these orbifolds were not identied
in ref. 1.

in the present paper we nd sets of new duality transformations which provide relations
among the sectors of the general current-algebraic orbifold.
in particular, the new dual-
ity transformations solve the identication puzzle of the ovme and allow the systematic
construction of the stress tensors of all the sectors of any current-algebraic orbifold.

the new duality transformations can be viewed as a synthesis of standard orbifold theory
(see refs. 9-22, 2, 23 and 24) and the theory of the h-invariant cfts (see refs. 25, 26,
and 5) in the vme: the set a(h) of h-invariant cfts on g collects the most general
ane-virasoro construction t (l) with a nite symmetry group h  aut(g), where the lie
algebra g can be simple or semisimple. each stress tensor t (l) in a(h) can also serve as
the stress tensor of the untwisted sector of an orbifold a(h)/h. for the stress tensors t(l)
of the twisted sectors  of a(h)/h, the new duality transformations

l  l(; l)

(1.3)

give the inverse inertia tensors l() of the twisted sectors in terms of the inverse inertia
tensor l of each h-invariant cft.

the paper is organized as follows. our motivation for this development is given in sec. 2,
where we nd the rst duality transformation which identies all the solutions of the ovme
as sectors of the orbifolds

here the cyclic group z and the dihedral group d permute the copies {g

j}, and a(d) is

the technical center of the paper is found in secs. 3 and 4. in sec. 3, we generalize the
result of sec. 2 to nd a set of duality transformations which constructs the stress tensors of
all the sectors of the orbifolds

a(z)

(1.5)

(1.6)

in these cases, the untwisted sector of each orbifold is described by the stress tensor

t (z) =

xj,l=0

lab

j l : jaj (z)jbl(z) :,

a, b = 1, ..., dimg

of any z(permutation)-invariant cft on g. here, jaj are  copies of currents at level k
and lab
j l is any solution of the reduced vme of the z(permutation)-invariant cfts (see
subsec. 3.2). the stress tensors t of the twisted sectors  of the orbifolds a(z)/z are
then obtained by the duality transformations in terms of the solution lab

where j (r)
aj satises the orbifold ane algebra g(). here () is the order of the orbifold
ane algebra and also the order of the element h of z. the integers n() are dened in
the text.

the explicit form of the new duality transformations in (1.7b) is a central result of
this paper, and, in this case, the duality transformations are seen to be discrete fourier
transforms. using (1.7) and the representation theory of orbifold ane algebra2, we compute
in eq. (3.49) the ground state conformal weights 0() of all the sectors of any orbifold
a(z)/z. in sec. 4 we also nd the cyclic orbifold virasoro master equation, which contains
all the sectors of the orbifolds a(z)/z.

extending the development of sec. 3, general orbifolds of the form

a(h)

h

,

h  aut(g)

(1.8)

are discussed for each xed h in sec. 5, where a(h) is any h-invariant cft on the ambient
lie algebra g. here the symmetry group h can be any nite subgroup of inner or outer

2

automorphisms of g, which itself may be simple or semisimple. formally, h can be extended
to lie groups. our results in this section include the form of the general twisted current
algebra for all h  aut(g) and the general duality transformations (which include (1.7)) for
the stress tensors of the twisted sectors of any orbifold a(h)/h. we also give the a(h)/h
orbifold virasoro master equation which collects the inverse inertia tensors of each sector  of
all the orbifolds a(h)/h at xed h  aut(g). the general formulation is complete up to the
solution of a well-dened eigenvalue problem for each symmetry group. the representation
theory of the general twisted current algebra is apparently a synthesis of the representation
theories of previously-known cases.

the explicit form of the stress tensors of all the permutation orbifolds a(s3)/s3 is ob-
tained in subsec. 5.3 and simple examples in a(z)/z are discussed in subsec. 4.4 and
app. e. a number of conceptual matters are also noted in app. e, including copy orb-
ifolds versus interacting orbifolds and the uncertainty relations associated to the duality
transformations.

2 solution of the ovme identication puzzle

in this section, the ovme identication puzzle is reviewed and solved. the central obser-
vation here is the rst duality transformation, which maps the solutions of the ovme onto
a particular set of solutions of the vme.

(2.1d)

(2.1e)

where the order  of g is any positive integer and g=1 is ane lie algebra68. the state
|0i is the ground state of the algebra. the quantities f c
ab are the structure constants of any

semisimple lie algebra g and the metric gab is

gab =

s1

ab,

k = k,

g = s1

=0g



(2.2)

when g has s generically distinct simple components g
killing metric of g

ab is the
 and unitarity on compact g requires that the invariant levels x satisfy

,  = 0, ..., s  1. here 

x = x,

x =

2k
  z+
2

where  is the highest root of g

. the metric in (2.2) assigns the same order 

g  s1

to each component g
 of the orbifold ane algebra.


=0g


(2.3)

(2.4)

the representation theory of orbifold ane algebras (including the ground state property
(2.1d) and the unitarity statement (2.3)) was obtained via the orbifold induction procedure
in ref. 2, to which the reader is referred for further detail.
it was also argued in ref. 2
that orbifold ane algebras occur in the twisted sectors of cyclic orbifolds, and a more
conventional derivation of orbifold ane algebra (indicated but not completed in ref. 2) is
given in sec. 3.

(2.5f)

was constructed on the orbifold ane algebra g, where (2.5c-f) is called the orbifold virasoro
master equation (ovme). the operator-product normal ordering

: a(w)b(w) := iw

dz
2i

a(z)b(w)

z  w

(2.6)

is used throughout this paper, where the contour does not encircle the origin.

in (2.5), the set of coecients l, called collectively the inverse inertia tensor of t , is any
solution of the ovme. the quantity c is the central charge of any solution l and 0 is the
conformal weight of the ground state

t (z) = xmz

l(m)zm2,

l(m  0)|0i = m,0 0|0i.

(2.7)

the symmetries (2.5d), (2.5e) and (2.5f) of the solutions of the ovme will play an important
role in the present paper and we will sometimes need combinations of these such as

lab
r = lab
r,

r = 0, ...,   1

which combines the gauge condition with periodicity.

the ovme is a large algebraic system, consisting of

nd(g, ) = (


2 + 1)

dimg(dimg + 1)

2

(2.8)

(2.9)

coupled quadratic equations for the same number of independent unknowns l. x is the
integer less than or equal to x. the number of physically inequivalent solutions to the ovme
is therefore expected to be

nd(g, ) = 2nd(g,)dimg

(2.10)

for each set of levels {x} of g. many properties and new solutions of the ovme were
discussed in ref. 1, to which we refer the reader for further detail.

two simple facts about the ovme will be important for our development here. first,

the ovme contains the virasoro master equation35 (vme) when  = 1,

 = 1 : ovme  vme

(2.11)

5

and in this case the conformal weight 0  0 of the ground state is zero. other relevant
properties of the vme will be reviewed in subsec. 2.4. second, the result (2.5g) shows that
the ground state conformal weight of the generic solution of the ovme is nonvanishing,

  2 :

0 6= 0

(2.12)

which indicates that each solution of the ovme for   2 gives a stress tensor of a twisted
sector of an orbifold. except in special cases, however, these orbifolds were not identied in
ref. 1. this is the ovme identication puzzle.

in what follows we nd a new duality transformation which identies the orbifolds of the

ovme.

2.3 the first duality transformation

for this analysis, it is convenient to introduce a more explicit notation,

a, b  a(), b(),

gab  ga()b()

,  = 0, ..., s  1,
ga()b() = g()

(2.13b)

(2.13c)

(2.13d)

for the semisimplicity specied by the composite indices a, b in (2.2) and (2.4). the symme-
tries (2.5d), (2.5e) and (2.5f) of the solutions of the ovme take the form

la()b()

(2.14a)

(2.14c)

in the explicit notation.

the rst duality transformation is the discrete fourier transform l of any solution l of

the ovme,

(from a()  b() of ovme )
(from gauge condition and periodicity of ovme) (2.17b)

(2.17a)

which, together with the periodicity condition (2.15b), will play an important role in the
discussion below.

we now consider the fourier transform of each term in the ovme, for example

= xm,

(2.18a)

(2.18b)

where we have used eqs. (2.5e) and (a.1). collecting all the terms, we nd the dual form
of the ovme:

a() = 1, ..., dimg

,

j l = lb()a()
la()b()
,  = 0, ..., s  1,

j, l = 0, ...,   1.

similarly, we nd for the dual form of the central charge

c = 2

(2.19c)

(2.20)

where we have used (2.16) and (a.1) to obtain the last form of c.

including the symmetries (2.19b) of l, the dual form of the ovme is seen to have the
same number of equations and unknowns nd (and hence the same number of solutions nd)
as those given for the ovme in (2.9) and (2.10).

in the following subsection, we will identify the dual system (2.19), (2.20) as a certain

consistent subansatz of the virasoro master equation.

(2.24a)
athe h-invariant cfts on g are discussed in refs. 25, 26 and 5: for any h  aut(g), the h-invariant
cfts a(h) on g are described by a consistent subansatz of the vme, i.e. a reduced vme with an equal
number of equations and unknowns. it is also known that a(h1)  a(h2) when h1  h2  aut(g).

moreover, using the vme (2.21c) to work out the reduced vme of the d(permutation)-

invariant cfts, we nd exactly the dual form of the ovme in (2.19)!

this allows us to identify the fourier transform l of any particular solution l of the

ovme as the inverse inertia tensor l of a particular d(permutation)-invariant cft.

finally, we may rearrange the central charge (2.21e) to nd that

c = 2ga(j)b(l)la(j)b(l) = 2x

g()

ab la()b()

0

= c

(2.26)

where we have used (2.23c) and (2.20). this relation tells us that the central charge c of
the d(permutation)-invariant cft is the same as the central charge c of the solution of the
ovme.

our interpretationb of these phenomena is that the rst duality transformation in

(2.15) and (2.16):

identies each solution l of the ovme as the inverse inertia tensor of a twisted
sector of the orbifold

where a(d) is the d(permutation)-invariant cft specied by the solution l
of the vme. the following section provides an alternate and more general derivation of

bas we will discuss in a sequel, the sectors described by the ovme also occur in the permutation orbifolds

a(d)/d.

this interpretation in the context of standard orbifold theory. the alternate derivation will
also construct the stress tensors of all the other twisted sectors of each orbifold a(d)/z,
beyond the single sector t in (2.5b).

3 the orbifolds of the z(permutation)-invariant cfts

in this section we develop a synthesis of standardc orbifold theory (see refs. 9-24, and in
particular subsec. 3.8 of ref. 2) and the theory of the h-invariant cfts on g (see refs. 25,
26 and 5) for the case h = z(permutation).
in particular, we use this development to
nd a set of duality transformations which gives the stress tensors of all the sectors of every
orbifold

a(z)

z

(3.1)

where a(z) is any z(permutation)-invariant cft. the results include as special cases all
the sectors of all the orbifolds

a(d)

,

d(permutation)  z(permutation)

(3.2)

associated to the ovme. general orbifold theory a(h)/h, h  aut(g) is considered along
the same lines in sec. 5.

3.1 z automorphisms

we consider rst the z automorphisms of  copies {g
corresponding currents jai  ja(i), where each copy is taken at ane level k,

i} of a simple algebra g and their

g = 1

i=0 g

a, b = 1, ..., dimg,

i, j, l, m = 0, ...,   1.

this corresponds to the case s = 1 in subsec. 2.4, and the generalization to arbitrary s is
discussed in sec. 4. the elements of z are

approach1316.

where h0 is the identity element. let (h) be the regular representation of h so that

jaj (z) = (h)jljal(z),

(h)  z  aut(g)

(h)jl = j+,l mod 

(3.5a)

(3.5b)

is an (outer) automorphism of the ane algebra.

for the discussion below, we will need some denitions. let () be the order of h and

(h), so that () is the smallest positive integer satisfying

(h)() = 1.

(3.6)

it is known that (  ) = (), and we also dene two integers m() and n() for each
element h

m() =

()



(3.7a)

(3.7b)

(3.8)

where we choose the conventions

n()m() = 1 mod ()

n(0) = 0;

1  n()  ()  1,

 = 1, ...,   1.

as an example, note that (1) =  and hence m(1) = n(1) = 1. other examples and a
closed form for n() are given in app. b.

3.2 the z(permutation)-invariant cfts

the set a(z) of z(permutation)-invariant conformal eld theories is dened to include all
inverse inertia tensors l in the vme which are invariant under all the z automorphisms in
(3.4):

la(j )b(l) (h)j j (h)ll = la(j)b(l),

 = 0, ..,   1

la(j)b(l) = lb(l)a(j)

(a()  b() symmetry).

the solution of (3.9a) and (3.9b) is

la(j)b(l) = la(j+1)b(l+1) = lab

j l

(z invariance)

lab

j l = lba

lj

(a()  b() symmetry)

and we will also specify the periodicity

lab
j l = lab

j l.

12

(3.9a)

(3.9b)

(3.10a)

(3.10b)

(3.11)

note that these specications dier from the d(permutation)-invariant cfts a(d) be-
cause (3.10) and (3.11) do not include the reection symmetry (2.24c). of course

a(d)  a(z)

(3.12)

because the solutions with the extra condition (2.24c) are included as special cases of the
z(permutation)-invariant cfts.

then follows from the general ane-virasoro construction (2.21).

a, b = 1, ..., dimg,

(3.13b)

(3.13c)

(3.13d)

(3.13e)

using the symmetries in (3.13c), one nds that the inverse inertia tensors can be pulled

back into the fundamental range

,  a  b when  is even.

it follows that the reduced vme (3.13 b,c) is a consistent system with

nc(g, ) = dimg{

(dimg  1)

2


2 + 1},

+ 

g

i = g

(3.14a)

(3.14b)

(3.15)

equations and unknowns, and hence the generically-expected number of z(permutation)-
invariant cfts is

nc(g, ) = 2nc (g,)dimg

(3.16)

on each level k of g. the numbers nc in (3.16) and nd in (2.10) agree for  = 2 because
z2 = d2. numerically one nds for example that

nc(su(2),  = 2) = 512,

nc(su(2),  = 3) = 4096

(3.17a)

13

nc(su(3),  = 2)  18 quintillion

(3.17b)

and the number of z(permutation)-invariant cfts increases exponentially with increasing
 and/or dimg.

the reduced system (3.13) also inherits many of the properties of the vme, including

k-conjugation8,2729,3,5

t (z) = tg(z)  t (z),

t (z)t (w) = o((z  w)0)

it should be emphasized that many other solutions of the reduced vme in (3.13) are
known, including those coset constructions8,27,28 which are z-invariant on semisimple g (see
app. e), as well as the unitary irrational solutions called (simply-laced g)q in ref. 33.

3.3 eigenvalue problem

for each element  of the automorphism group z  aut(g). because each  is an orthogonal
matrix, the matrix of eigenvectors can be taken to be unitary:

xj

urj;j(u )j;sl = r,s mod  j,l mod 



, xr,j

(u )j;rj urj;l = j,l mod 

(3.20)

and we often omit the label  as seen here. the spectral resolution of each automorphism

jl = xr,j

(u )j;rj er urj;l

14

(3.21)

will also be useful below.

solution of the eigenvalue problem is straightforward. because (h) has order (), we
know that its eigenvalues are the th roots of unity, and we may choose the uniform ordering
convention

er() = e 2ir

()

for the eigenvalues. with this convention we may also choose

u 

r,j;j = ur,j;j

xj

ur,j;jus,l;j = r+s,0 mod  j,l mod 



, xr,j

ur,j;jur,j;l = j,l mod 

because each  is real.

an explicit solution which satises all these conditions (see (a.2)) is

u()rj;j =

2in()r(jj )

(3.24)

(3.25)

(see (a.3)). the general solution u of the eigenvalue problem (3.19) is given in app. c,
where it is also shown that the extra structure in u corresponds to automorphisms of the
orbifold ane algebra.

3.4 the eigencurrents of sector 
we return to the currents jai, i = 0, ...,   1 on semisimple g = 1
satisfy the ane algebra

i=0 g

i, g

i = g which

(3.26a)

(3.26b)

(3.27)

of the z automorphisms on these currents. next, we dene the eigencurrents j of sector

u()rj;ijai(z) = er()ja,rj(z)

(3.29)

according to (3.27) and (3.21).

using (3.26), (3.28a), (3.23) and (3.25), we nd that the eigencurrents satisfy the algebra

ja,rj(z)jb,sl(w) = jl[

()kabr+s,0 mod ()

(z  w)2

(3.30b)

(3.30c)

for each  = 0, ...,   1.

3.5 the twisted currents of sector 

in abelian orbifold theory922,2,23,24, there is an orbifold sector for each element  = 0, ..., 1
of the automorphism group, where the trivial element  = 0 corresponds to the untwisted
sector and  = 1, ..,   1 are the twisted sectors.
in each sector , one has the twisted
currents j which are in one to one correspondence with the eigencurrents j of that sector
(3.31)

ja,rj(z) 

aj (z)  j (r)
j (r)

a(j)(z),

 = 0, ...,   1.

the aspects of this correspondence are twofold: in the rst place, the twisted currents of
sector  have the diagonal monodromy

j (r)
aj (ze2i) = er() j (r)

aj (z),

er() = e 2ir

()

(3.32)

which corresponds to the diagonal action (3.29) of h on the eigencurrents. second, the
twisted currents of sector  satisfy a twisted current algebra whose ope form (but not its
mode form) is isomorphic to the opes (3.30a) of the eigencurrents of that sector.

combining these two properties, we nd that the twisted currents j of sector  satisfy

16

the twisted current algebra (3.33a) is recognizedd as the orbifold ane algebra

()

(3.33a)

(3.33b)

(3.33c)

(3.33d)

(3.34)

j is taken at
on the semisimple lie algebra 
orbifold ane order (). we emphasize that the order () of the orbifold ane algebra
g() is also the order of the automorphism h.


() simple copies g

j, where each of the
g


() 1
j=0

the untwisted sector has (0) = 1 and hence r, s = 0, so the orbifold algebra (3.33)

reduces in this case to the untwisted ane lie algebra (3.26a) on semisimple g:

g = 1

j=0 g

j = 1

j=0g

j ,

jaj (z)  j (0)

aj (z).

(3.35)

when an index j has range 0 to  1, it is our convention to replace that index by a capital
letter as a reminder that we have returned to the semisimplicity of the vme in (3.3).

the representation theory of orbifold ane algebra was obtained via the orbifold induc-

tion procedure in ref. 2. in particular, we know that

j (r)
aj (m +

r

()

)|0i = 0 when (m +

)  0

where |0i is the ground state of sector .

we can also construct twisted currents j with mixed monodromy in each sector

(3.38)

gives the twisted currents j as the monodromy decomposition of j .

dthe preceding derivation of orbifold ane algebra was indicated but not completed in ref. 2.

17

3.6 the stress tensor of sector 

we begin with the stress tensor t of any z(permutation)-invariant cft (see subsec. 3.2)
and rewrite it, using (3.28a), in terms of the eigencurrents j of each sector

t (z) = xj,l

lab

j l : jaj (z)jbl(z) : = xr,s xj,l

lab

j lu ()j;rju ()l;sl .

(3.39a)

(3.39b)

then we may use the ope isomorphism (3.31) to deduce that the stress tensor t of sector
 is

t(z)

t (z) 
la(j)b(l)

r,s

t(z) = xr,s xj,l

() : j (r)

aj (z) j (s)

bl (z) : .

(3.40a)

(3.40b)

the virasoro property of t follows from that of t because the opes of j and j are
isomorphic.

using eq. (a.5a), one nds that the coecients l have the property

la(j)b(l)

r,s

() = r+s,0 mod ()la(j)b(l)

r

()

t(ze2i) = t(z)

(3.41a)

(3.41b)

which guarantees the trivial monodromy shown for t in (3.41b). furthermore using (a.5b)
we can evaluatee lr in (3.41a) to obtain the explicit form of the stress tensor of sector

the explicit form of this set of duality transformations is one of the central results of the
paper.

in particular, the duality transformations (3.42b) give the inverse inertia tensors

g

i = g

(3.43)

where a(z) is the z(permutation)-invariant cft on g whose inverse inertia
tensor is l.

in fact, the stress tensor t in (3.39a) of the untwisted sector can also be obtained from

t in (3.42) by choosing  = 0. this gives the connection

in app. d, we note that unitarity of the untwisted sector of any orbifold a(z)/z implies
unitarity of all the twisted sectors. moreover, app. e collects some simple examples of the
duality transformations in (3.42).

a(d)

z

(3.51)

and, correspondingly, the set of duality transformations (3.42) is easily specialized to the
higher symmetry of a(d) in (2.30). this gives the duality transformations for all the
sectors of all the orbifolds a(d)/z

the ovme. unfortunately the answer is in general no because the generic sector (3.52) of
a(d)/z does not satisfy the symmetry (2.8),

() 6= la(j)b(l)
which is required for the sector to be in the ovme.

 the cyclic copy orbifolds (1
 the cyclic orbifolds on j diag()

 a(d)/z for   7

these and related examples are discussed explicitly in app. e.

4 the cyclic ovme

which contains the stress tensors of all the sectors of all the permutation orbifolds

and which contains the ovme as a consistent subansatz

cyclic ovme  ovme.

(4.1)

(4.2)

we note in particular that the duality transformations are sucient to derive the cyclic
ovme from the vme without having to do any additional opes explicitly.

4.1 return to general semisimplicity

runs over copies of the algebra g. (recall that we chose the case s = 1 and hence ,  = 0
for simplicity in sec. 3.)

on this semisimplicity, the general ane-virasoro construction takes the form

t (z) = la(j)b(l) : ja(j)(z)jb(l)(z) :

la(j)b(l) = lb(l)a(j)

j, l = 0, ...,   1,

(a()  b() symmetry)
,  = 0, ..., s  1

and we dene the z(permutation)-invariant cfts by the relations

ja(j)(z) = (h)jl ja(l)(z)

la(j )b(l)(h)j j (h)ll = la(j)b(l),

where (4.14 b-d) is the cyclic orbifold virasoro master equation (cyclic ovme) at integer
order . the cyclic ovme, which also reduces to the vme at  = 1, is another central
result of this paperg.

we have checked that the cyclic ovme in the form (4.14) also contains the other sectors
with  6=  in the duality transformations (4.9b). to see this explicitly, one needs to consider
the cyclic ovme with the explicit semisimplicity

discussed above and for the vme in sec. 2. in particular, the other sectors with  6=  are
found at order  of the cyclic ovme with the residual z/ symmetry (4.9f). solutions at
order  with no residual z/ symmetry are sectors of a(z)/z orbifolds.

one concludes that the cyclic ovme contains all the sectors of all the orbifolds

a(z)/z, where a(z) is any z(permutation)-invariant cft.

it is instructive to compare the cyclic ovme in (4.14) to the ovme in (2.5), noting
the small but important dierences in their form and the symmetries required for each.

fthe form of c and 0 follow from (3.47) and (3.49a).
galthough the system (4.14) was derived here by duality from the vme, we have also checked these

results by direct ope computation as in ref. 1.

25

in particular, the symmetries of the solutions of the ovme imply the symmetries of the
solutions of the cyclic ovme

but not necessarily vice versa. for this reason, the cyclic ovme (4.14) reduces to the
ovme (2.5) when the gauge condition (2.5f) of the ovme is used in the cyclic ovme
(and s    s in the sums).

it follows that the ovme is included as a consistent subansatz of the cyclic ovme,

which is consistent with the fact that

(4.17)

for the special case of  = 2, the arrow of (4.16) is reversible because r = r mod 2. this
tells us that the ovme and the cyclic ovme are identical at  = 2, which reects the fact
that d2 = z2.

4.3 technology of the cyclic ovme

we have provided two computational approaches to the orbifolds a(z)/z. in the more
conventional approach shown in fig. 1,

fig. 1 starting from the vme

one starts in the untwisted sector l of any z(permutation)-invariant cft and constructs all
the twisted sectors l via the duality transformations (3.42b). this is the approach followed
for simple examples in app. e. alternately, one may start by nding the twisted sectors l
directly by solving the cyclic ovme. both approaches have their own merits and, indeed,
new solutions have been found at both ends of the problemh. consequently, we give here
hthe vme solutions33 known as (simply-laced g)q have an sq(permutation)-invariance (when (j) = 0),
and so these constructions are solutions of the reduced vmes in (2.30) and (3.13) when q = . used
in (3.42b), the solutions (simply-laced g)q give many examples of new a(sq)/zq  a(zq)/zq orbifolds.
moreover, many new solutions of the ovme were found in ref. 1, including the lie g-invariant constructions
discussed below.

26

a brief discussion of the cyclic ovme in its own right.

the cyclic ovme (4.14b) is a set of

nc(g, ) = dimg{

(dimg  1)

2


2 + 1}

+ 

(4.18)

coupled quadratic equations and unknowns, so the number of physically inequivalent solu-
tions to the cyclic ovme expected at each level k is

nc(g, ) = 2nc (g,)dimg.

(4.19)

these numbers nc and nc are the same numbers (3.15) and (3.16) found for the reduced
vme of the z(permutation)-invariant cfts.

many properties of the ovme persist in the cyclic ovme. in particular k-conjugation

t(z) = tg()(z)  t(z),

t(z) t(w) = o((z  w)0),
g() =

j=0

j
g

c = cg()  c

persists in every sector , with order (). here g() is the orbifold ane algebra (3.33)
and tg() is the orbifold ane-sugawara construction in sector  (see ref. 1 and eq. (e.8)).
moreover, the duality transformations in (4.9b) are invertible, so they can be used to
construct all the sectors of any a(z)/z orbifold from any particular solution of the cyclic
ovme. as a simple case, we consider the formula for the sectors l() at order () which
are generated by a given solution lab
r of the cyclic ovme on simple g at order   2, as
shown in fig. 2.

to proceed, we assign sector 0, with (0) = , to the solution lab
r where 0 can be chosen
to be any integer from 1 through   1, so long as 0 and  are relatively prime. we also
need the integers n(0), n() and p (, 0):

n(0) 0 = 1 mod ,

n()  ()



= 1 mod (),

p (, 0) n(0) = 1 mod ()

where p (, 0) is a new integer which characterizes the transition from 0 to . the result
for l() is

where we have explicitly indicated the 0 dependence of l() inherent in this procedurei.
when () =  (so that j = l = 0 and p (, 0) = 0), eq. (4.22) relates any other

solutions at order  of the cyclic ovme to the given solution at order 

lab
r (; 0) = lab

n ()0r .

(4.23)

these relations show that all solutions of the cyclic ovme at order  are related by transfor-
mations in aut(z)  aut(g). this is the aut(z) covariance discussed in ref. 1. similarly,
all sectors with common order () are related by transformations in aut(z()).

4.4 example: the gdiag()-invariant cyclic orbifolds

as an example of the technology above, consider the lie g-invariant constructions 1 at order
 of the cyclic ovme (4.14) on simple g

iit can be seen from (4.22) that dierent choices of 0 produce a reordering of the twisted sectors
and dierent forms for l in the untwisted sector. these ls dier however only by transformations in
s  aut(g), and so are physically equivalent. this phenomenon underlies the otherwise mysterious fact
that the number nc in (4.18) is the same for the cyclic ovme (4.14) and the reduced vme (3.13) of the
z(permutation)-invariant cfts.

it follows from the symmetries in (4.29c) that l solves the reduced vme (2.30 b,c) of the
d(permutation)-invariant cfts. this fact and the symmetry gdiag() in (4.27) suggest the
name gdiag()-invariant cyclic orbifolds for this class of cfts: these are the orbifolds in
a(d)/z whose untwisted sectors l are also invariant under the symmetry gdiag generated

we emphasize however that the gdiag()-invariant cyclic orbifolds have the gdiag()-invariance
(4.27) in every sector.

these examples also illustrate an important aspect of our new duality transformations:
solutions such as (4.24) whose form1 is relatively simplej at the ovme level can result in
(e.g. the case33 of
intricate solutions such as (4.29b) at the vme level and vice versa.
(simply-laced g)q, which is relatively simple at the vme level, will give fourier series in the
twisted sectors.)

5 general orbifolds

5.1 discussion

in section 3, we generally followed the dotted line in the commuting diagram shown in fig. 3,

jwith (4.29) one may construct the untwisted sectors of the orbifolds corresponding to the lie g-invariant
constructions at  = 5 and 6 in ref. 1. at  = 5, these are quasi-rational orbifolds with irrational conformal
weights and rational central charge. other quasi-rational cfts are discussed in ref. 5.

simple or semisimple. formally, h can be extended to lie groups.

5.2 general twisted current algebra and a(h)/h

(5.2c)

where {(h)} is a representation of h and j  satises the same algebra as j. then the
h-invariant cfts a(h) on g are described by

and this set of inverse inertia tensors l is guaranteed25 to satisfy a consistent reduced vme
(such as those in eqs. (2.30) or (3.13)).

in general orbifold theory21,18,23, the sectors of the orbifolds a(h)/h correspond to the
conjugacy classes of h. picking one element h  h from each class, we need the solutions
to the h-eigenvalue problem

(5.4b)

for each sector , where  and u are unitary, {n(r)} is a set of h-dependent integers and
() is the order of h. the case h = z(permutation) was solved in subsec. 3.3. following
the conventions above, r is the spectral index and  (which in general depends on r) replaces
(a, j) as the degeneracy index of the eigenvalue problem.
the eigencurrents j of sector  are then dened as

jr(z)  ()ru() a

r ja(z),

ja(z) = u () r

a (()r)1jr(z)

jr(z) = er() jr(z),
where ()r is an arbitrary normalizationk.

jr(ze2i) = jr(z)

(5.5a)

(5.5b)

the opes of the eigencurrents j are easily computed and then one uses the ope

isomorphism

jr(z) 

jr(z)

(5.6)

to nd the algebra g  g(h  aut(g); ) of the twisted currents j with diagonal monodromy

the result (5.7) is presumably the most general twisted current algebra, since
it collects the twisted current algebras of every sector of every orbifold a(h)/h,
kin the previous sections (and in fig. 3) we chose ()r = p() to obtain the conventional form (3.33)

of orbifold ane algebra for j in each sector.

h  aut(g). see eqs. (3.33) and (3.34) for the special case g()  g(z  aut(g); ),
which is the correct set of orbifold ane algebras for a(z)/z.

note in particular that the ope form of the general twisted current algebra (5.7) can be

obtained from the untwisted ane algebra (5.2a) by the duality algorithm

a  r,

g  g,

f  f ,

(5.8)

we will return below to the representation theory of the algebras (5.7).

to obtain the stress tensors of the twisted sectors, one uses (5.5a) to eliminate j in favor

of j in the h-invariant stress tensor t given in (5.3b). then, using the correspondence

t (z) 

t(z)

one nds the general duality transformations l  l

(5.10b)

(5.10c)

which give the stress tensors t of all the twisted sectors of all the orbifolds
a(h)/h, h  aut(g). the general duality transformations include the special case (3.42)
when h = z(permutation). note also that the general duality transformations in (5.10b)
are always invertible (l  l) so that one may solve for the inverse inertia tensor of all
sectors in terms of the inverse inertia tensor of any given sector (see e.g. eq. (4.22)).

the twisted sectors (5.10) show k-conjugation covariance8,2729,3,5 in the form

t(z)
t(z)g = t(z) +

where the orbifold k-conjugation (5.11 a-c) is the map, via the duality transformation
(5.10b), of the ordinary k-conjugation (5.11d) in the untwisted sector. here lg is the inverse
inertia tensor of the ane-sugawara construction8,27,3032 on g and t(z)g with lg  lg is
the general orbifold ane-sugawara construction on the twisted current algebra g = g(h 
aut(g); ) in (5.7).

note also the identity

0 = lr,s() (1  er()es()) = lr,s() (1  e 2i(n(r)+n(s))

()

)

(5.12)

which follows from (5.10b), the h-symmetry of lab in (5.3b) and the h-eigenvalue problem
(5.4a). this tells us that the stress tensors of the twisted sectors have trivial monodromy

lr,s()  n(r)+n(s),0 mod ()

t(ze2i) = t(z)

(5.13a)

(5.13b)

as required. the relation in (5.13a) generalizes the form (3.41a) found above for a(z)/z.
we also give the a(h)/h orbifold virasoro master equation, which collects the

inverse inertia tensors of a(h)/h, h  aut(g) for each h and :

(5.14a)

(dual to lab = lba)

(5.14b)

(dual to lh h h = lh )

(5.14c)

where g() and f () are the twisted metric and twisted structure constants in (5.7), and
the round brackets mean r  s symmetrization as in the vme. for a(z)/z, h = z 
aut(g), this system reduces to the cyclic ovme on g() in (4.15b) and the symmetries of
the cyclic ovme in (4.14).

the general ovme (5.14a) can be derived by the general duality transformations (5.10)
from the vme (2.21c). alternately, the general ovme can be obtained immediately from
the vme by the duality algorithm

a  r,

g  g,

f  f ,

l  l.

(5.15)

the reason this works is that the ope form of the general twisted current algebra satises
the same duality algorithm (5.8), so that every step of a direct ope verication of the general
ovme follows immediately from the corresponding steps for the vme. note in particular
that, under the index map a  r, the indices in the general ovme are threaded in
exactly the same way as those in the vme.

this completes our general discussion of the new duality transformations in orbifold
theory but there are several remaining loose ends. first, one may use the results above to

34

explicitly verify that only one element of each conjugacy class is necessary for non-abelian
orbifolds: when  and  are in the same conjugacy class of h, follow the steps

 = vv,

vv = 1,

v c
a v d
lcd(v) a

b gcd = gab,
c (v) b

d = lab,

v d
a v e

b (v) c

v  h  aut(g)
de = f c

g f g

ab

e = e,

u  = uv

g(u ) = g(u),

f (u ) = f (u),

l(u ) = l(u).

(5.16a)

(5.16b)

(5.16c)

(5.16d)

it follows that g,f , and l are class functions, so that the general twisted current algebra
(5.7) and the stress tensors (5.10) are invariant across each conjugacy class. as seen in
the example of app. c, we expect that the ambiguities in u at xed  correspond to
automorphisms of the general twisted current algebra.

second, one may easily construct the currents j with mixed monodromy

ja(z)  u () r

a

(()r)1 jr(z),

ja(ze2i) = (h) b

a

jb(z)

jr(z) = ()ru() a
r

ja(z)

(5.17a)

(5.17b)

whose opes are isomorphic to the original current algebra (5.2a).

third, we emphasize that our result (5.10) also contains more general orbifolds of the

form

a(h )

h 

a(h)

h

,

h  h   aut(g)

(5.18)

because a(h )  a(h). in such cases, one uses the same duality transformations (5.10) for
h, but now with the inverse inertia tensors lh 

lh  h  h  = lh   lh

(5.19)

of the h -invariant cfts (see subsec. 3.8). it follows that the number of sectors of each
a(h )/h is still the number of conjugacy classes of h.

a more practical matter is the representation theory of the general twisted current al-
gebra g(h  aut(g); ) in (5.7). when g is simple, these algebras are inner- or outer-
automorphically twisted ane lie algebras, depending on whether h is a group of inner or
outer automorphisms of g. the representation theory of these two types of twisted algebras
is discussed in refs. 34-36, 22 and refs. 37, 24 respectively.

when g is semisimple and h  s acts as (outer-automorphic) permutations among
 copies, we expect that the twisted current algebras (5.7) are commuting sets of orbifold
ane algebras at various orders , whose representation theory was obtained via the orbifold

35

induction procedure in ref. 2. this is implicit in the work of ref. 23 and follows because the
elements of all the subgroups of s can be written as products of disjoint cyclic permutations.
as an example, this conclusion is illustrated for the permutation orbifolds a(s3)/s3 in the
following subsection.

when g is semisimple and h is any subgroup of s times an inner automorphism of
g, then one expects that (5.7) gives various versions of the doubly-twisted orbifold ane
algebras (which combine inner- and outer- automorphic twists) obtained in ref. 1. the
representation theory of these algebras should involve a synthesis of the principles already
known for inner automorphisms and for outer automorphisms by permutation.

finally, we note that when a(h) has a larger chiral algebra, such as a superconformal
algebra or a non-linear chiral algebra, the same techniques can be used to treat the larger
twisted chiral algebras in each sector of a(h)/h.

5.3 example: the permutation orbifolds a(s3)/s3

as an example of the general development above we consider the permutation orbifolds
a(s3)/s3, starting with the s3(permutation)-invariant cfts a(s3) on g  g  g,

t = la(j)b(l) : jaj jbl :,

la(j)b(l) = jlab + lab

(5.20a)

(5.20b)
where ab and lab are a  b symmetric. the s3(permutation)-invariant cfts satisfy a
consistent reduced vme which we omit for brevity.

a, b = 1, ..., dimg,

j, l = 0, 1, 2

first, pick one element  from each conjugacy class of s3,

0 = 


1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1




1 = 


0 0 1
1 0 0
0 1 0




2 = 


1 0 0
0 0 1
0 1 0




(5.21)

where 0 corresponds to the untwisted sector with t0 = t in (5.20). the element 1 is
also an element of z3, so the sector corresponding to 1 is included in the discussion of z3
orbifolds above (but with the s3-invariant form in (5.20b) instead of the z3-invariant form
(3.10)). the element 2 is new, but it is a direct sum of an element of z1 and an element of
z2.

using the duality transformation (3.42b) we nd the stress tensor t1 of the twisted

sector corresponding to 1,

t1 = (lab +

the appearance of orders 1 and 2 in this sector correlates directly with the z1 and z2
decomposition of 2. the eigencurrents of this sector show that the currents ja and j (r)

the v s here are the us of sec. 3, and the special case u = v corresponds to ajl = jl
(i.e. pjl = jl and (j) = 0). the general us in (c.1) also satisfy (3.23) and (3.25) and so
can be used in all formulae involving u and u  in the text.

appendix d. unitarity

in this appendix, we use the results of sec. 3 to show that unitarity of the untwisted sector
of any orbifold a(z)/z implies unitarity of all the twisted sectors.

unitarity has two components in any sector. the rst component is the requirement of
a good hilbert space: on compact g, the duality transformations of sec. 3 show that the
invariant levels of the ane algebra (3.26) and the orbifold ane algebra (3.33) are related
as follows

x =

2k
2  z+ 

x = x   z+

(d.1)

so a good hilbert space in the untwisted sector implies a good hilbert space in each twisted
sector, as discussed in ref. 2 and noted in eq. (2.3).

the second component of unitarity is l(m) = l(m), where l(m) are the virasoro
generators of sector . as usual5, we discuss this part of the problem only in cartesian bases
of the relevant lie algebras (equivalent statements in other bases are easily deduced).

in such bases, we recall the current mode relations

j (r)
aj (m +

r


) = j (r)

aj

j (r)
aj

(m +

jaj (m) = jaj (m)
  r
((m + 1) +

r  
) = j (r)


aj (m  1 +

r


)

) = j (r)

aj

(m 

r


)

(d.2b)

(d.2c)

given in ref. 2, where the adjoint operation in (d.2b) was derived from the orbifold induction
procedure. eq. (d.2c) is the mode form of eq. (2.1c). it then follows from the mode form
of t and t in (3.13a) and (3.42a) that ( is complex conjugation)

(la(j)b(l)) = la(j)b(l)

(d.3a)

(d.3b)
are the extra conditions on the inverse inertia tensors such that l(m) = l(m) in all
sectors. the condition (d.3a) in the untwisted sector is only a special case of the known
unitarity condition (lab) = lab for any solution of the vme in a cartesian basis.

(la(j)b(l)

r

) = la(j)b(l)

r

it is easily checked from the duality transformations in (3.42 b,d) that (d.3a) in the

untwisted sector guarantees (d.3b) in the twisted sectors.

moreover, unitarity of any given sector of the orbifold implies the unitarity of every

sector.

appendix e. orbifolds entirely in the ovme

in this appendix, we study examples of the permutation orbifolds

a(d)

z

(e.1)

all of whose sectors are in the ovme (2.5). more precisely, this means that we assume the
reection symmetry in (e.2c) of the d(permutation)-invariant cfts

t = xj,l

la(j)b(l) : jaj jbl := xj,l
g = 1
a, b = 1, ..., dimg,

i=0 g

(e.2a)

g

i = g

j, l = 0, ...,   1

(e.2b)

(e.2c)

where g is simple, and every current jai is taken at the same level k. using the duality
transformations in (3.42b), we will also require the gauge/periodicity condition of the ovme
in (e.3a)

t = xr,j,l

la(j)b(l)

r

() : j (r)
aj

r = 0, ..., ()  1,

() = la(j)b(l)

()  1

j, l = 0, ...,

(e.3a)

(e.3b)

for all the twisted sectors l. the orbifold currents j satisfy the orbifold ane algebra g()
in (3.33), and the other symmetries of l and l in (2.30) and (2.5) are also assumed.

41

in all these examples, t and 0() can be read to include t = t=0 and 0 = 0( =

0) = 0 via the identication

for the untwisted sector.

j l = la(j)b(l)

(e.4)

 cyclic copy orbifolds
an important class of cyclic orbifolds was identied in ref. 2, which we call the cyclic copy
orbifolds

i=0ai
z 

a(s)

z

,

z(permutation)  s(permutation)  aut(g)

because the stress tensor of the untwisted sector of each of these orbifolds is a sum of 
commuting copies:

t =

note that the inverse inertia tensor l is maximally localized in k = j  l whereas the
inverse inertia tensors l are maximally spread in r. this is an example of an uncertainty
relation associated to our duality transformations (3.52) and (3.53). the factor jl in (e.7a)
is a residual localization for 1 <  <  which is induced by the jl localization of (e.6a).

the wzw cyclic orbifolds are the only cyclic copy orbifolds which are also gdiag()-invariant
cyclic orbifolds (see subsec. 4.4) and, as seen in eq. (4.20a), all orbifolds in a(z)/z are
paired by k-conjugation through the wzw cyclic orbifolds.

 cyclic orbifolds on jdiag()
all other cyclic orbifolds (for which the stress tensor of a(z) is not a sum of  commuting
copies) are called interacting cyclic orbifolds. we focus here on a simple class of interacting
cyclic orbifolds

because every sector of these orbifolds is constructed entirely on these currents. the currents
j diag() form an integral ane subalgebra2 in each sector  and the zero modes qdiag() of
j diag() were encountered in eq. (4.27b).

the untwisted sectors of these orbifolds are given by

the cyclic orbifolds on j diag() are extraordinary among orbifolds (or they may not be orb-
ifolds at all) because all their sectors have zero ground state conformal weight. these con-
structions also illustrate the uncertainty relations in a dierent way: l is maximally spread
in k = j  l while l is maximally localized in r.

among the cyclic orbifolds on j diag(), one set of orbifolds

is also gdiag()-invariant (see subsec. 4.4). the sectors of these orbifolds are described by a
set of ane-sugawara constructions8,27,3032 on {j diag()}.

 interacting coset orbifolds
we turn next to a simple example of the interacting coset orbifolds

g = 1

where gdiag is the diagonal subalgebra of g. orbifolds of this type are distinct from the coset
copy orbifolds

1
i=0(g/h)i
z

(e.15)

which are special cases of the cyclic copy orbifolds in (e.5).

44

the stress tensors of the interacting coset orbifolds (e.14) are k-conjugate partners to

the ane-sugawara constructions on j diag():

tg/gdiag = tg  tgdiag

c() = c = 2kdimg(

(e.16c)
(see (e.8) and (e.13)). the stress tensors t of the untwisted sectors are the (ordinary) coset
constructions8,27,28 (g/gdiag). when  = , the stress tensors t are kac-wakimoto38,39,2
coset constructions, and when  6=  these stress tensors generalize the kac-wakimoto coset
constructions to the case of semisimple g. this conrms the conjecture of ref. 2 that the
kac-wakimoto coset constructions occur in the orbifolds (e.14).

using the duality transformations (3.42b), many other interacting coset orbifolds, for

example,

(

g

h(z))
z

,

h(z)  g

(e.17)

can be constructed from the coset constructions g/h(z), where h(z) is any subalgebra of
g which preserves the z-invariance of g/h. equivalently, one can start with the ovme
constructions tg/h, h  g (see ref. 1) and complete these orbifolds via the duality
transformations in eq. (4.22).

 a(d)/z with prime 
if  is prime then every twisted sector of any orbifold a(d)/z has order () = , and so
these inverse inertia tensors take the simple form

every twisted sector  of every a(d)/z orbifold with   7 has order () = 2, 3 or . as
a result, we will see that, up to automorphisms of the orbifold ane algebra (see app. c),
every inverse inertia tensor of these orbifolds is in the ovme.

sectors with order () = 2 have only two twist classes, r = 0 and 1. using the identity

r = r mod 2,

r = 0, 1

we see that the periodicity of l implies the gauge/periodicity condition
()

()  la(j)b(l)

r

() = la(j)b(l)

r

la(j)b(l)

r

() = la(j)b(l)

r

(e.19)

(e.20)

and so l() satises the ovme at order () = 2. the sectors with order () =  are also
in the ovme (see subsec. 3.8).

the nal case, () = 3, is more dicult. there are two such sectors in a(d)/z with

  7:

 = 6,

 = 2 and 4,

(2) = (4) = 3.

(e.21)

for brevity we will restrict our attention to the sector  = 2, but the same approach can be
applied to  = 4. the inverse inertia tensors l( = 2) are given by the duality transformation
(3.42):

la(j)b(l)

r

(2) =

1
3

(lab

jl + e 2ir

3 lab

jl+2 + e 4ir

3 lab

jl+4).

(e.22)

in particular the j = 1, l = 0 components can be rewritten using the reection symmetry
in (e.2c),

la(1)b(0)

0

(2) =

2
3

lab

1 +

1
3

lab
3 ,

la(1)b(0)

2

and we see that generically

1

la(1)b(0)
1
3

(2) =

1
3

(1 + e 4i

3 )lab

1 +

(2) =

(1 + e 2i

3 )lab

1 +

3

e 4i

3 lab
3

la(1)b(0)

(2) 6= la(1)b(0)

(2).

(e.23a)

(e.23b)

(e.24)

since l does not satisfy the gauge condition in (e.3a), the sector  = 2 is not in the ovme.
on the other hand, we can nd a physically-equivalent l( = 2) that is in the ovme
by using the automorphisms of the orbifold ane algebra (see app. c) at this order. the
choice of automorphism

ajl(r) = jle

2irl

3

:

pjl = jl,

(j) = j mod 3

(e.25)

46

yields the physically-equivalent inverse inertia tensor

la(j)b(l)

r

(2) = xj,l la(j)b(l)

r

(2)ajj(r)all(r) =

2ir(jl)

e

(lab

jl + e 2ir

3 lab

jl+2 + e 4ir

3 lab

jl+4)

which in fact satises the gauge/periodicity condition of the ovme.

to see this, we note that there are only two cases to consider (j = l = 0 and j  l = 1)
because j and l are 0 or 1 when (/) = 2. the symmetry lr = lr follows in the rst case
since we can use the reection symmetry (e.2c) to write

(e.26)

la(j)b(j)

r

(2) =

1
3

(lab

0 + 2 cos(

2r

3

)lab

2 ) = la(j)b(j)

r

(2).

(e.27)

for the case j  l = 1, we can again use (e.2c) to obtain

la(j)b(j1)

r

(2) =

1
3

(2 cos(

2r

3

)lab

1 + lab

3 ) = la(j)b(j1)

r

(2)

(e.28)

so l(2) is in the ovme.

this completes the demonstration that, up to automorphisms of the orbifold ane alge-
bra, all sectors of all orbifolds a(d)/z with   7 are in the ovme. when   8 however,
many twisted sectors of a(d)/z can only be found in the cyclic ovme (4.14).
