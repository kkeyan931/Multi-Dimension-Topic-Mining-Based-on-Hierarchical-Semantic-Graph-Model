abstract

in a recent paper seiberg and witten have argued that the full action de-
scribing the dynamics of coincident branes in the weak coupling regime is
invariant under a specic eld redenition, which replaces the group of or-
dinary gauge transformations with the one of noncommutative gauge theory.
this paper represents a rst step towards the classication of invariant ac-
tions, in the simpler setting of the abelian single brane theory. in particular
we consider a simplied model, in which the group of noncommutative gauge
transformations is replaced with the group of symplectic dieomorphisms of
the brane world volume. we carefully dene what we mean, in this context,
by invariant actions, and rederive the known invariance of the borninfeld
volume form. with the aid of a simple algebraic tool, which is a generaliza-
tion of the poisson bracket on the brane world volume, we are then able to
describe invariant actions with an arbitrary number of derivatives.

1 introduction

the physics of branes with large background magnetic elds is intimately connected,
as shown in various works1 [1, 2], to gauge theories on noncommutative spaces. in
particular, it has been shown, in a detailed study [1], that there exists a large free-
dom in the possible description of the physics of the gauge degrees of freedom which
live on the brane worldvolume. one is free to choose the noncommutativity pa-
rameter on the worldvolume, and each possible choice can be reached by a suitable
gaugeorbit preserving eld redenition. the most striking feature of the full ac-
tion describing the brane dynamics at small string coupling is that, regardless of the
choice of the noncommutativity parameter, it is, after the abovementioned eld
redenition, invariant in form, in a sense which will be made sharper in the later part
of this introductory section. this property of the brane action is highly nontrivial,
and does constrain the action in a considerable but not fully understood way. in
particular it has been argued in various settings [1, 7] that, if one considers only
terms without derivatives, and if one looks at the u(1) single brane theory, then
the unique action which is form invariant is the borninfeld one, which is known to
describe the low energy phenomena of brane physics.

it is of importance to understand how the invariance described in [1] constrains
the brane action in the more general nonabelian u(n) context, and also how it
constrains higher derivative terms. there has been already some results in this di-
rection [6], but the methods are not systematic, and become of increasing complexity
after the rst few terms have been constrained. this paper is a rst step towards a
classication of invariant actions, in a simplied context in which the geometric na-
ture of the problem reduces the task to a manageable one. in particular we will not
address the nonabelian case, restricting ourselves to the u(1) theory. moreover we
will work in a simplied setting, relying on a previous note [7, 8] by the author. in
particular, we will substitute the group of noncommutative gauge transformations
with the simpler group of symplectic dieomorphisms of the brane worldvolume,
and we will carefully describe what we mean by invariant actions in this case. with
the aid of a simple algebraic tool, which is a generalization of the natural poisson
bracket on the brane worldvolume, we will then be able to generate in a simple
and powerful way invariant actions with an arbitrary number of derivatives.

let us note that the classication of invariant actions is intimately tied to a
deeper understanding of tduality in the context of openstring physics [9]. this
can be better understood if we toroidally compactify spacetime. it is then true
that, for some integral values of the magnetic b eld, one can consider the brane

conguration as a bound state of higher dimensional branes with branes of lower
dimension. tduality then exchanges the two types of branes, and therefore also
changes the underlying gauge group. there must therefore exist a (highly non
local) eld redenition which maps gauge orbits of one gauge group to gauge orbits
of the other gauge group. moreover the form of the action must be invariant under
tduality, and therefore the eldredenition must respect the form of the action.
again, this is a highly nontrivial requirement, and it can be shown [9] to be equiv-
alent, using simple morita equivalence arguments, to the statements described in
[1].

this paper has the following structure. we conclude this section by recalling
the results of [1], both to set notation and to clarify what we mean by invariance
of the brane action. in section 2 we then briey recall the work [7] and describe
the simplied setting within which we shall consider the problem. the invariance
of the borninfeld action is then shown in section 3, and it is used to give a clear
denition, in section 4, of what we mean by invariant actions within the setting of
this paper. in section 5 we nally introduce the generalized bracket and we show
how it can be used to construct invariant brane actions with an arbitrary number
of derivatives. a few examples with two derivatives are then considered in section
6. conclusions and open problems are left for the nal section 7.

let us then proceed to a quick review of [1]. we will work throughout with units

such that

2 = 1.

let m = rn be the at spacetime manifold, parametrized by coordinates xa, and
with constant background metric and ns twoform given by the matrices gab and
bab (we will assume that bab is invertible). the arguments that follow do not rely on
supersymmetry considerations, and are valid both in the context of bosonic string
theory as well as in the context of type ii superstring theories. we then indicate
with n the spacetime dimension, with the understanding that n = 26 or n = 10.

we shall not be interested in the physics of the closed string sector, and we
will accordingly leave the geometry of the background spacetime manifold xed.
we will, on the other hand, concentrate on the dynamics of open string sector of
the theory, by introducing n branes of maximal size  i.e. such that the brane
worldvolume coincides with the spacetime manifold m. the dynamical degrees
of freedom are then described by a u(n) connection on m. in the weak coupling
regime gs  0 the interaction of the brane gauge bosons are computed from string
theory disk diagrams, and can be reconstructed from a low energy eective action

and the coecients cabcd,   are constructed from the tensor gab (for example the
4 gacgbd) as indicated by the notation, the complete eect of the
rst coecient is 1
ns twoform b is obtained by replacing the u(n) eld strength f with  = f + b
in the action.

the above action is dened only up to eld redenitions. the simplest type of
redenition, which had been already considered extensively in the works [3, 4, 5],
are gauge covariant and leave the general form of the action invariant, with the
unique eect of changing some of the coecients. the redenition is of the form
aa  aa + dbcdbfac +    , where again the coecients dbc,   are constructed in
terms of the metric. a more powerful possible eld redenition has been shown
to exist in the recent work [1]. the change of variables does not preserve the
group of gauge transformations, but on the other hand it substitutes it with the
group of gauge transformations of noncommutative gauge theory on the world

volume m. more precisely, there is a transformation aa  baa (which we shall call
noncommutative eld strength bf , or, better, of the combination

in the above, the new metric tensor gab and string coupling constant gs are given
by

moreover, the coecients c abcd are obtained starting from the coecients cabcd and
replacing the metric gab with gab. finally, the noncommutativity parameter den-

in the work [1] the transformation aa  baa is determined using the two require-

ments that it must preserve gauge orbits and that it must be expressible as a power
series in , with the coecients of the series being local expressions in the elds.
these requirements clearly denes the map up to gaugecovariant local eld rede-
nitions. on the other hand a more precise statement of [1] says that there is, among

the possible maps aa  baa, one for which the action is forminvariant, in the sense

the problem of invariance has not been analyzed in any detail. we will now
describe, in the next sections, a simplied setting which will allow us to tackle the
problem in a simple but powerful way.

2 the simplied setting

we will, throughout the rest of this paper, work in the simplied context of the
abelian u(1) theory. although this choice does imply a considerable loss of infor-
mation, we will see that the abelian theory has already a rich structure, and does
provide partial information about the nonabelian case.

the second simplication concerns the map aa  baa, and follows the authors

previous note [7]. in this section we quickly review the results of [7], and we rephrase
them in the context of the problem at hand. the starting point of [7] is the obser-
vation that the twoform  = b + f denes a symplectic structure on m. on one
hand  is clearly closed. moreover, since we always work perturbatively in f , and
since b is invertible, one can take the formal inverse of , thus showing that  is
nondegenerate. therefore, by darbouxs theorem, one can nd coordinates i on
m such that3

 =

bij di  dj.

in these new coordinates, the uctuations of the eld strength f have been replaced
by the parallel displacements of the brane, which are described by the coordinate

i g

2we recall that f  g = exp( i
3we will use the following general conventions concerning coordinate systems and indices. a
general coordinate system on m will be denoted by , and in general will have greek indices
, , . the xed coordinate system xa will be called at, and will have in general roman indices
a, b, . finally coordinate systems i for which the twoform  has constant coecients bij will
be called symplectic, and will have roman indices i, j, .

functions xa(). moreover the coordinates i are clearly dened up to symplec-
tic dieomorphisms of m. the original group of abelian gauge transformations is
replaced by the group of symplectomorphisms of (m, ), and the correspondence
between aa(x) and xa() respects the gauge orbits of the two group actions. one
is therefore in a situation similar to the one considered in [1], with the simplifying
dierence that the group of noncommutative gauge transformations is replaced by
the group of symplectomorphisms of the brane worldvolume.

to make contact with the notation of the previous section one denes the poisson

bracket{,} with respect to the symplectic structure on m

{f, g} =(cid:18) 1
(cid:19)

f g.

the above formula is particularly simple if one uses the symplectic coordinates,
and it then reads

{f, g} = ijif jg.

if one denes the noncommutative gauge potential baa by

and the corresponding eld strength by4

xa() = a + abbab()
bfab = abab  bbaa +nbaa, babo ,
{xa, xb} = ab = bfab  bab,

one nds that

where we have lowered the index on the coordinate function xa using bab

xa = babxb.

we have quickly reviewed the results of [7] and we are therefore in a position,
given the above notation, to rephrase the meaning of the invariance of the action
given in section 1 in this new framework, starting from the simple invariance of the
borninfeld volume form.

4this is clearly an exception to the index convention, which is forced by the notation.

5

3 invariance of the borninfeld volume form

in this section we prove the exact invariance of the borninfeld volume form under
the change of coordinates described in the previous section. before we do so, let us
though clarify one point of notation.

in order to limit the number of symbols, we will use, as a general rule, the same
letter to indicate an abstract tensor, and its components in a specic coordinate
system, and we will rely on our index convention to distinguish among coordinate
systems. in some cases though this might be confusing, given the standard notation
in the subject. for example the metric tensor g = gabdxadxb reads, in a symplectic
coordinate system (recall gab = bacbbdgcd)

g = gabixajxb di  dj = gabixajxb di  dj.

following the general rule, we could use the symbol gij for gabixajxb. we will
not do this, and we will reserve the letter gab for the constant metric in the at
coordinate system, and will always write gabixajxb when using coordinates.
similarly we will use bij instead of ij.

with this in mind, let us consider the borninfeld volume form

 =

1
gs

dnpdet(g + b + f ) =

1
gs

dnpdet(g + ).

in at coordinates xa one has

 =

1
gs

dnxpdet(g + )ab.

let us now compute the volume form  in the symplectic coordinates i.
introduce the matrixvalued eld

if we

j = ikgabkxajxb

we easily compute that

tr m = gabba = tr

tr m 2 = gabgcdtr xaxbxcxd = gabbcgcdda = tr

tr m n = tr(cid:18) 1

using the above equation one can show that

pdet(1 + gabxaxb) =sdet(cid:18)1 +

g

(cid:19)

6

by expanding det 1/2(1 + a) in terms of traces of powers of a. we may then check
that, in the symplectic coordinates i, the borninfeld form reads (using equation
2)

 =

=

thus proving the invariance of the borninfeld action under the simplied seiberg
witten change of variables described in the previous section.

4 statement of the invariance problem

we now have the notation needed to dene the concept of invariant action within
the setting of this paper, and to describe the problem that we wish to address. we
will not give general denitions and proofs, but we will work with some meaningful
examples, with the hope that the general case can be easily understood from them.

we start with a basic observation, by noting that

{i, f} = ijjf,

and therefore that

{xa, f} = af + {baa, f}  bdaf.

then, in the limit b  ,   0, one has that5
{xa, f}  af.

this means that the correct dual for a generic derivative term

abcd

are using an index a, b, in a symplectic coordinate system. this is the same exception noted in

5the correspondence {xa, = bda  a is a notable exception to the index convention, since we
the previous footnote, since bfab = bdabdb  bdbbda.

7

is given by

{xa,{xb, cd}} = {xa,{xb,{xc, xd}}}.

at the level of the action s describing (equation 2)the brane worldvolume degrees
of freedom we may consider a generic term

1

gsz dnxpdet gabgadgbegcf abcdef .

following the above observations, this term in the action should correspond, in the
symplectic coordinates i, to the term

1

gsz dnpdet gabgadgbegcf{xa, bc}{xd, ef}.

in the above discussion we have not addressed an important issue, which depends
on the fact that we are not considering the full nonabelian theory, but that we
are uniquely concentrating on the abelian u(1) theory, and that we are therefore
neglecting commutator terms. more precisely, let us note, for example, that the
correspondence

abcd  {xa,{xb, cd}}

is not welldened.
in fact, although the partial derivatives ab commute, the
corresponding poisson bracket derivatives {xa,{xb,  }} do not. on the other hand,
the commutator is proportional, by the jacobi identity, to

{ab,  }

and therefore vanishes in the limit b  ,   0. we can therefore state a precise
form of the invariance concept which we wish to analyze.

denition 1 the abelian action s for a single brane is invariant under the simpli-
ed seibergwitten transformation described in section 2 if it has, when written in
terms of the symplectic coordinates i, the same form (as described in this section)
as in the original at coordinates xa, up to terms which vanish in the b  ,
  0 limit.

in the next section we will see that, with the aid of a simple algebraic tool, we
will be able to easily generate actions which do possess the property just described.

8

5 the generalized bracket and invariant actions

in order to construct in a systematic way actions which are invariant in the sense
described above, we introduce a bilinear dierential operation dened on functions,
which generalizes the poisson bracket {,}. given two functions f and g on m we
dene the bracket [f, g] by

[f, g] =(cid:18) 1

g + (cid:19)

f g.

let me note that the above bilinear form is not antisymmetric

[f, g] 6=  [g, f ]

and does not satisfy the jacobi identity. on the other hand it will be an extremely
useful tool in constructing invariant actions.

an intuitive argument for the above denition is the following. we know that
the eect of the ns twoform b is described with the replacement f   = f + b.

the string worldvolume) and by noting that the transformation b  b + d, a 
a  , leaves both the action and  invariant. on the other hand, if one considers

this is justied by looking at the string conformal eld theoryr b +r a ( is
the massless closed string sector vertex operators (hab + bab)r d2z x ax beikx one

notices that the natural combination6 which appears is g + b. therefore, one is lead
to look at expression g + b + f = g + , which is present both in the borninfeld
volume form, and in the bracket [, ] which we have just described.

let us start with a rst basic example, by computing the bracket [xa, xb]. in the

at coordinates xa one simply obtains

(cid:2)xa, xb(cid:3) =(cid:18) 1

g + (cid:19)ab

.

on the other hand one can compute the bracket [, ] in the symplectic coordinates i.
in this case it will be easier to consider the quantity [xa, xb], where we have lowered
the indices with xa = babxb. from the denition we obtain that

[xa, xb] =(cid:18)

1

xcxdgcd + b(cid:19)ij

ixa jxb.

6the combination e = g + b is also relevant in tduality on tori, where it transforms as

e  e1.

9

we can then expand the denominator in powers of the induced metric xcxdgcd
and obtain

[xa, xb] = (cid:0)  xcxdgcd +   (cid:1)ij

ixa jxb
= {xa, xb}  {xa, xc}gcd{xd, xb} +   
= (cid:18)  
= (cid:20)g(cid:18) 1

 +   (cid:19)ab
g + (cid:19) g(cid:21)ab

g 

1
g

.

for reasons which we will shortly describe, we dene the functions ya by

we can then use the previous computation and write

ya = gabxb = gabbbcxc.

[ya, yb] =(cid:18) 1

g 

1

g + (cid:19)ab

.

(3)

the importance of the functions ya is that they play, in a symplectic coordinate
system, the same role played by the coordinates xa in a at coordinate system. more
precisely, all contractions of the functions xa with metric tensors gab are equal to
equivalent contractions of the functions ya with the tensor gab = bacbbdgcd. for
example

we can then consider the simple action

gab(cid:2)xa, xb(cid:3) = gab[xa, xb] = gab[ya, yb].
z  gab(cid:2)xa, xb(cid:3) =z  gab[ya, yb].
g(cid:1)ab
if one neglects the term (cid:0) 1
though one cannot neglect in general the constant (cid:0) 1

we have proved in the last section the invariance of the borninfeld volume form.
and the minus sign in the expression 3 for [ya, yb],
the previous computation would shows that the above action is invariant. clearly

g(cid:1)ab. the correct solution is

then to consider derivative terms, which automatically eliminate the constant part
in the expression for the bracket [ya, yb]. in the framework of this paper this fact
is yet an other indication that the borninfeld action is the unique action without
derivatives which is invariant under the seibergwitten transformations.

let us now move to the analysis of derivative terms. to this end we consider a

second example, and we compute the double bracket

(cid:2)xa,(cid:2)xb, xc(cid:3)(cid:3) .

10

in the at coordinate system one simply has

(cid:2)xa,(cid:2)xb, xc(cid:3)(cid:3) =(cid:18) 1

g + (cid:19)ad

d(cid:18) 1

g + (cid:19)bc

.

using the previous results, and computing in the symplectic coordinate system, one
has, on the other hand,

1

(cid:2)xa,(cid:2)yb, yc(cid:3)(cid:3) = (cid:18)

ixaj(cid:18) 1

= {xa,(cid:18) 1

xf xdgf d + b(cid:19)ij
g + (cid:19)bc

g + (cid:19)bc
g + (cid:19)bc
} + {xa, xf}gf d{xd,(cid:18) 1
g + (cid:19)bc
(cid:2)ya,(cid:2)yb, yc(cid:3)(cid:3) = (cid:0)gad + gae{xe, xf}gf d +   (cid:1) {xd,(cid:18) 1

finally, rewriting the result solely in terms of the coordinates ya, one obtains

}

} +    .

= (cid:18) 1

g + (cid:19)ad

{xd,(cid:18) 1

g + (cid:19)bc

}.

we now see that, recalling the correspondence

one has invariance of the term(cid:2)xa,(cid:2)xb, xc(cid:3)(cid:3), up to a minus sign.

let us now move to a third and last example, by computing the triple bracket

{xa,  a

(cid:2)(cid:2)xa, xb(cid:3) ,(cid:2)xc, xd(cid:3)(cid:3) .
g + (cid:19)ef
e(cid:18) 1

as before, in at coordinates, the expression is easily computed as

(cid:2)(cid:2)xa, xb(cid:3) ,(cid:2)xc, xd(cid:3)(cid:3) =(cid:18) 1

g + (cid:19)ab

f(cid:18) 1

g + (cid:19)cd

.

using again the previous results, and following the usual procedure of expanding
the generalized bracket in powers of the induced metric, one obtains

(cid:2)(cid:2)ya, yb(cid:3) ,(cid:2)yc, yd(cid:3)(cid:3) = (cid:18)

g + (cid:19)cd

1

j(cid:18) 1

xgxhggh + b(cid:19)ij
g + (cid:19)ab
i(cid:18) 1
g + (cid:19)cd) +
= ((cid:18) 1
g + (cid:19)ab
,(cid:18) 1
g + (cid:19)ef(xe,(cid:18) 1
g + (cid:19)ab)(xf ,(cid:18) 1
+(cid:18) 1

g + (cid:19)cd)

11

in this case we have complete invariance of the term under consideration. let us
note that a new feature of this last example is that the expression in terms of the

variables ya contains an explicit commutator termn(cid:0) 1
g+(cid:1)ab

present in the same expression in terms of the variables xa. on the other hand the
commutator vanishes in the b  ,   0 limit, and therefore should be neglected,
as already noted in the denition given in the last section. we are therefore ready
to state the following

g+(cid:1)cdo, which is not
,(cid:0) 1

claim 2 consider a product  of terms, each of which is a multiple bracket of the

coordinate functions xa (for example one term could be of the form(cid:2)(cid:2)xa, xb(cid:3) ,(cid:2)xc, xd(cid:3)(cid:3)

or [xa, [xb, xc]]). moreover, let all the free indices a, b,   be contracted using the
metric tensor gab. let us further assume that

1. no single term in  is a single bracket of the form [xa, xb] (all terms are
derivative terms, so that the constant part in [ya, yb] does not spoil invariance).

2. there is an even number of basic brackets [xa, xb] (which are, by 1, necessarily

contained within other brackets).

then the action

z  

is invariant under the simplied seibergwitten transformations.

let us note that, given two actions s1 and s2 which are invariant, so is the linear
combinations as1 + bs2. therefore we should consider in general actions of the form

r  (a11 + a22 +    ), where the coecients ai must be determined from other

considerations.

6 some examples

in this last section we analyze in some detail two examples of simple invariant actions
with two derivatives, in order to make contact with actions of the form 1. we will
work only in the at coordinate system, and we will therefore neglect the index
convention, using both indices a, b,   and indices i, j,   .

let us start by considering the action

z  gacgbd(cid:2)(cid:2)xa, xb(cid:3) ,(cid:2)xc, xd(cid:3)(cid:3)

12

we will for simplicity of notation, but with no loss in generality, take gs = 1 and
gab = ab. moreover we will write all the equations in the case bab = 0, therefore
replacing  with f . the lagrangian then becomes

the following quick computation

l1 =pdet(g + f ) gacgbd(cid:18) 1
g + f(cid:19)cd
gacgbdi(cid:18) 1

g + f(cid:19)ab

j(cid:18) 1

g + f(cid:19)ij

g + f(cid:19)ab
i(cid:18) 1

j(cid:18) 1

g + f(cid:19)cd

.

 i (f  f f )ab j (f  f f )ab
= ifabjfab + i (facfcb) j (fadfdb)

can then be used to show that

l1 = ifabifab +

where    denotes terms of order f 2nf f with n  3.

let us analyze a second action, again with two derivatives, given by

it has the following lagrangian

z  gadgbegcf(cid:2)xa,(cid:2)xb, xc(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:2)xd,(cid:2)xe, xf(cid:3)(cid:3) .
g + f(cid:19)dj
g + f(cid:19)bc(cid:18) 1
i(cid:18) 1
l2 =pdet(g + f ) gadgbegcf(cid:18) 1
again we can expand in powers of f . using the fact that(cid:16) 1
g+f(cid:17)ab

g + f(cid:19)ai

following the computation

g + f(cid:19)ef
j(cid:18) 1
gf(cid:17)ba
=(cid:16) 1

and

1  f(cid:19)ia(cid:18) 1

1 + f(cid:19)aj

i (f  f f )bc j (f  f f )bc

= (1 + f f )ij i (f  f f )ab j (f  f f )ab +   

we conclude that

l2 = l1 + o(f 6f f ).

(5)

the purpose of the last two examples if twofold. on one hand, they clearly
show that the invariant actions introduced in the previous section do have sensible

13

expansions in powers of f and derivatives  and are of the expected general form.
in particular, expressions like equation 4 have already appeared in the literature in
various settings [4, 5, 3]. on the other hand the above examples, and in particular
equation 5, show that the high f behavior of the action is not completely determined
by the rst terms in a power series expansion. it is nonetheless true that, given a
xed number of derivatives, the number of possible structures is nite (recall that
one cannot introduce nonderivative brackets [xa, xb] in the action). therefore one
needs to x in principle a nite number of coecients in order to x completely the
high f behavior of the action, given a xed number of derivatives.

7 conclusions

we have shown that, with the aid of a generalized poisson bracket, we are able
to construct actions with any number of derivatives which are invariant under a
simplied version [7] of the seibergwitten transformations described in [1]. clearly
this is just a rst step in a full classication of invariant actions in the sense described
in the introductory section.

first of all, even within the present setting, one should show that all invariant
actions are linear combinations of the ones described in section 5. we have shown
that the actions given in terms of [, ] are invariant, but by no means we have claimed
that all invariant actions are of the form which we have considered. also, still within
the context of the abelian u(1) theory one should reconsider the above analysis using
the full group of noncommutative gauge transformations. the results in this paper
heavily rely on the geometrically intuitive nature of the simplied transformation
in order to extend the analysis to the more
general setting of [1], one should therefore have a better geometrical understanding
of the full seibergwitten transformations. this question is probably intimately
related to an understanding of the invariance problem in the extremely complex
nonabelian case.

a  ba which we have considered.
