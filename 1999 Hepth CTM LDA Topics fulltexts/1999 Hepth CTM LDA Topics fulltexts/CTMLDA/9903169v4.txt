abstract

we constructed canonical non-highest weight unitary irreducible represen-

tation of cso(1, n) current algebra as well as canonical non-highest weight non-

unitary representations, we constructed certain laplacian operators as ele-
ments of the universal enveloping algebra, acting in representation space. we
speculated about a possible relation of those laplacians with the loop operator
for the yang-mills.

1 introduction

recently, there was a lot of interest in string theories on ads and other manifolds
with boundaries, and to their relationship to yang mills quantum eld theories on the
boundary. string theory on ads has a symmetry group, corresponding to isometries
of target space, whose bosonic part is so(1, n). there should be conserved noether
currents corresponding to such symmetries. also, such string theories should be
described by conformal eld theories.
if the conformal eld theory is unitary, the
currents are holomorphic, and give rise to a kac-moody algebra. from analyticity
on world sheet, the space of states in such conformal theory, associated to points on
worldsheet, should be in highest weight modules of the kac moody algebra, and then
there is a virasoro algebra coming via the sugawara construction [8]. namely, the
currents are (closed) one forms on the world sheet ja(.)dx, the integrals of which
over paths gives conserved charges, with values in lie algebra; and equal time
commutation relations of currents should be such as to reproduce the lie algebra
commutators of charges; if we integrate the current over a path  on world sheet with
weights (),   , and use commutation relations for currents, we will get

[z

 jad,z

 jbd] = f abcz   jcd + kz d;

and in particular, taking a closed path, parametrised by , and ,  of the form
ein, we get that fourier coecients of currents satisfy commutation relations of a
kac-moody algebra.

in our case, the algebra is so(1, n), which is a real form of a complex algebra;
still it can be promoted to a kac-moody-like loop algebra in the usual way; it is
generated by ei r p (s), with ei  so(1, n), p (s) laurent polynomials, and the
bracket [ei  p (s), ej  g(s)] = [ei, ej]  p (s)g(s) + k (ei, ej) res( dp
ds g), where (., .)
is an invariant symmetric form on so(1, n); this form is not positive-denite. highest
weight module for such loop algebra is not unitary.

if we think about boundary states, those associated with the boundary of world
sheet disk, say states associated to a circle, we cannot deduce from analyticity that
the state must be highest weight, as functions {ein} on a circle, unlike functions {zn}
at the origin, are equally good for positive or negative n, and in fact there are two
possible candidates for representations: one non-unitary highest weight, and another
unitary, not highest weight. non highest weight representations are little studied in
the framework of the conformal eld theory; in particular, there is no meaningful way
to have a sugawara construction of the virasoro algebra; instead, it is quite natural
to get certain innite dimensional laplacians in the universal enveloping algebra.

algebra and unitary action of operators in uni-
versal enveloping algebra

2.1

we introduce a space s of real valued functions on a circle, which is a vector space
over real numbers with basis {e[n]  sn }nz, and with some positive denite inner
product

(e[n], e[m]) = f [n, m]
f [n, m] = f [m, n]; f [n, m]  r+,

(1)

extended by linearity to the whole space. usual multiplication of functions give rise
to a product, e[n]  e[m] = e[m + n].
if we want multiplications by s  e[1] and
s1  e[1] to be self-adjoint operators

(e[n], s  e[m]) = (s  e[n], e[m])
(e[n], s1  e[m]) = (s1  e[n], e[m]),

then from ( 1) we have a condition

therefore in this case we should have

f [n, m + 1] = f [n + 1, m].

f [n, m] = f [n + m, n  m mod 2]

(2)

where n mod 2 is 0 for even n and 1 for odd n. such scalar products exist:
example: consider the inner product

(e[n], e[m]) =z 



tn tm exp[(t2 + 1/t2)] dt

it is obviously positive denite and (e[n], e[m]) depends only from n + m

we can and will consider other scalar products where mutiplication by s is not

self-adjoint.
example: intoduce a sclar product

(e[n], e[m]) = n,m (n)

(3)

where (n) > 0 for all n  z. such scalar product is obviously positive-denite. from
the denition of the adjoint operator (e[n], s e[m]) = (s e[n], e[m])is easily follows
that in this case

s e[n] =

e[n  1]

2.2

the loop algebra cso(1, n) has an interesting unitary, non-highest weight irreducible
2 = 1 with integral zero, z (x)dx = 0, and with the scalar product

representation, which we believe is important and which we describe below. consider
2 + . . . +
the hilbert space h of real valued functions (x) on a sphere sn: x1
xn

2 + x2

h, i =z z (x)(x ) ln (1  (x, x )) dxdx 

(4)

it is possible to show that for functions on a sphere with zero integral such scalar
product is positive- denite.

let us introduce a hilbert space h of maps (x, s) from s1 into h. for laureant

polynomials,

(x, s) =

mxn=n

n(x) e[n](s)

where n(x)  h, and {e[n]}nz is the basis in s. we dene the scalar product in h
as follows:

(e[n], e[m]) z z n(x)m(x ) ln (1  (x, x )) dxdx ,

<(), ()> =xm,n
we introduce also bosonic fock space f of symmetric tensor products f =lm s hm,

which is also a hilbert space with the scalar product

and then take the completion.

h()m , ()mi = m! h() , ()im

or more generally,

<1  2 . . .  n, 1  2 . . .  m> =

0, m 6= n

x{}

nyi=1

<i, i> , m = n

we also introduce exp(()) in a completion of f,

its easy to see that

exp((x, s) = 1 +

2.3 unitary irreducible representation of loop algebra cso(1, n)

via rst order dierential operators acting in f

we consider maps s1  g from a circle into the lie algebra so(1, n), with the point-
wise lie bracket,

{i1, i2} (s) = {i1(s), i2(s)}

(9)

this lie algebra cso(1, n) is given by generators and relations

{iij(f (s)), ikl(g(s))} = jkiil(f g(s))  jliik(f g(s)) + ilijk(f g(s))  ikijl(f g(s))

{iij(f (s)), ik,0(g(s))} = jkii,0(f g(s))  ikij,0(f g(s))

{ii,0(f (s)), ij,0(g(s))} = ii,j(f g(s))

(10)
this algebra has the following representation in f: for any v = 1  2  . . .  n  f,
with {i}  h,

1  2  . . .  (d[i[f (s)]]i) . . .  n + [i[f (s)]]  1  2  . . .  n

t [i(f (s))].v =(cid:16)d[i[f (s)]] + [i[f (s)]]  <[i[f (s) 1]],(cid:17).v 
xi
xi

<[i[f (s)1]], i> 1  2  . . . i/ . . .  n

(11)

here d are derivations, which satisfy the leibnitz rule in f,

d[i(f (s))] 1  2  . . .  n =xk

1  2  . . . (cid:16)d[i(f (s))]k(cid:17)  . . .  n

and are given by the following dierential operators in h:

d[iij(f (s))] (x, s) = f (s) (xij  xji)) (x, s),

d[ii,0(f (s))] (x, s) = f (s) (i  xi(x)  (n  1)xi) (x, s),

(12)

d[ii,0(f (s))] 1 = 0;

i

in rn, so that [i, xj] = i,j;

here i 

and  acts via tensor multiplication in f, with

[iij(f (s))] = 0

[ii,0(f (s))] = (n  1)f (s)i(x),

(13)

5

where i(x) is a function on a sphere equal to the i-th coordinate, i(x) = xi.

such  is a one-cocycle:

d[i1][i2]  d[i2][i2] = [ {i1, i2} ]

(14)

proposition 2.1.
1) dierential operators d[i(f (s))] are correctly dened in h
2)the operators d[i(f (s))], which are adjoint in h to operators d[i(f (s))], are
equal to (d[i(f (s))], where f (s) is the adjoint operator to the multiplication by
f (s) in s

d[i(f (s))] = (d[i(f (s))]);

in particular, if multiplication by s is self adjoint in s, see ( 2), then d[i(f (s))] are
scew self-adjoint in h.

operators d[i(f (s))] act naturally in h: if  =p ngn, with {n}  h, {gn}  s,

then

where d[i] are the dierential operators ( 12).

d[i(f (s))]  =x d[i]n f (s)gn,

proposition 2.2

1) operators t [i(f (s))] in f have the property t [i(f (s))] = t [i(f (s) 1)]; in
particular, if multiplication by s is self adjoint in s, see ( 2), then t [i(f (s))] are scew
self-adjoint in f.
2) operators t [i(f (s))] satisfy the commutation relation of the algebra, that is for
any v  f

(cid:16)i1[f1]i2[f2]  i2[f2]i1[f1](cid:17).v =hi1, i2i[f1  f2].v

proof: to prove 1), use ( 11) and ( 6) to show that that for any v = 1  2  . . .  n
and w = 1  2  . . .  n in snh

1  2  . . .  (d[i[f (s)]]i) . . .  n> =

<w, d[i[f (s)]].v> = <w,xi
=x{}xi
<(i), d[i[f (s)]]i> yj6=i
<(d[i[f (s)]])(i), i> yj6=i
=x{}xi
= <(d[i[f (s)]](cid:17).w, v>

<(j), j> =

<(j), j> =

since in f <snh, smh> is zero for m 6= n, the above equality is true for any v, w  f
similarly, since for any v = 1  2  . . .  n1 in sn1h and w = 1  2  . . .  n

6

in snh,

<(i), [i(f (s))]> yj6=i

<w, [i(f (s))]  v> =x{}xi
< (cid:16)< [i[f (s)]],(cid:17). w, v > ,
< w, (cid:16) < [i[f (s) 1]],(cid:17). v > = <  [i[f (s) 1]]  w, v >

<(j), j> =

and also for any v  snh and w  sn1h,

collecting all terms, we obtain 1)

2) can be veried by a straitforward computation

2.4 representation of the universal enveloping algebra in f

elements in the universal enveloping algebra, which are polynomials in generators, are
represented by operators acting in f given by corresponding polynomials of operators
t [i(f (s))]. the commutation relations of the algebra are satised due to proposition.

2.5 operators lm

denition: operators lm

dene lm to be elements of the universal enveloping algebra given by

lm =
xi

c(m) =

t [iij(e[k])] t [iij(e[k + m])] 

+xk=xi<j
t [ii,0(e[k])] t [ii,0(e[k + m)]]!  c(m)1,
+xk=xi

<[ii,0(e[k] 1)] , [ii,0(e[k + m])]>

(15)

where operators t [i(f (s)] are dened in ( 11), and {e[k]} is the basis in s, see ( 1).

proposition 2.3. the action of lm in f as a formal series is well dened.

indeed, it is easy to check that for an   h and any k, m  z

(cid:16)xi<j

d[iij(e[k])] d[iij(e[k + m])] xi

d[ii,0(e[k])] d[ii,0(e[k + m])](cid:17)  = 0

7

and

d[ii,0(e[k])] .[ii,0(e[k + m])] = 0

xi

therefore, dangerous terms disappear, and for any v = 1  2  . . .  n  f,

lm.v =xk (cid:16)

1  2  . . .  a/  . . .  b/  . . .  n

remark. it is easy to check, that unlike in sugawara construction of the virasoro
algebra from current algebra in highest weight modules, here a normal ordering of
operators t [i] in l gives the same expression as the one without the normal ordering.

proposition 2.4.
1) lm commutes with all operators t [i(f (s))], with f (s)  s
2.a)for scalar product in s such that multiplication by s is a unitary operator, ( 2),
operators lm are formally ( as a formal series) self-adjoint; however, ||lmv|| is innite
for a generic v  f
2.b)for scalar products ( 1) in s, such that multiplication by s is just a bounded
operator, not necessarily a self adjoint one, operators lm are not self adjoint; for
some scalar products, ||lmv||f is nite for a generic v  f.

l0 vs. loop equation

let us modify the construction of the representation, ( 11) and ( 6), as follows: let

a =ln hn (no symmetrization, unlike the previous construction). the inner product

in a is dened as

<1  2 . . .  n, 1  2 . . .  m> =

0, m 6= n

nyi=1

<i, i> , m = n

(16)

=

in this new representation, currents act on v = 1  2  . . .  n  a, with {i}  h,
as follows:

1  2  . . .  (d[i[f (s)]]i) . . .  n+

t [i(f (s))].v =(cid:16)d[i[f (s)]] + [i[f (s)]]  <[i[f (s) 1]],(cid:17).v 
xi
nxi=0
xi

<[i[f (s)1]], i> 1  2  . . . i/ . . .  n

1  2  . . . i  [i[f (s)]]  . . .  n

+

(17)

it is easy to check that the commutation relations are satised, and that operators
t [i(f (s))] are scew self adjoint for scalar products in s where multiplication by s is
self-adoint. we construct operators lm in the universal enveloping algebra as before,
( 15).

there are similarities between two innite-dimensional laplacians, l0 and the loop
operator l for a wilson loop (monodromy ) w [x(s)] of the yang-mills connection

a(x)dx on sn, w [x(s)] = z da(x) p exp iix(s)
4x1
with the loop equation l w [x(s)] z ds1ds2(s1  s2)

adx! exp(cid:18)zsn

f  f(cid:19) ,





x(s1)

x(s2)

w [x(s)] = 0; for

a non-selntersecting path {x(s)} being a consequence of the yang mills equation for
the connection a(x)dx.

let us think about v  a as about certain functions in many variables,

v(x(1), t1, x(2), t2, x(n), tn) = 1(x(1), t1)  2(x(2), t2)  . . .  n(x(n), tn), where each

9

x(a) takes values in sn. then

l0.v =

(cid:16) xk=

xi

dx(a)[ii,0(e[k](ta))] dx(b)[ii,0(e[k](tb))](cid:17)v(cid:17)

+(terms with not more then one derivative),

(18)
where dx(a)[i(f (ta)] are dierential operators acting as dierentiation only in x(a)
variables, with coecients which are functions of x(a), ta

the terms in ( 18) which involve 2 dierentiations in the same variable cancel
out, since in fact the second order operator restricted to diagonals ( we will call this
restricted operator la, a = 1, 2, . . . n )is zero,

la :=

xk=]inf ty(cid:16)xi<j

dx(a)[iij(e[k](ta))] dx(a)[iij(e[k](ta))]

xi

dx(a)[ii,0(e[k](ta))] dx(a)[ii,0(e[k](ta))](cid:17) = 0

(19)
in h for every a. we view this equation as in some sence a discrete approximation to
the loop equation. the restricted operator la consists of 2 pieces, the spin operator
for the maximum compact subgroup of rotations of sn, and the non-compact piece;

they both come with the same innite constant

1 (which in some regularization,

is pretty small, 1 + 2(0) = 0 ) ; but since the constant is the same for both terms,
we can divide by this constant to compare. dividing by this constant, we will get

xk=

la :=(cid:16)xi<j

dx(a)[iij(1)] dx(a)[iij(1)]

xi

dx(a)[ii,0(1)] dx(a)[ii,0(1)](cid:17) = 0

dx(a)[iij(1)] dx(a)[iij(1)] is unitary and compact; in some basis

the spin operatorxi<j

it reduces to multiplication by constants, the total spin. this spin cannot be equal to

10

zero, since the only eigenvalue for zero spin is the function which is identically one,
and those were thrown out our hilbert space h. the remaining piece is the usual
laplacian operator, up to lower order terms in derivatives, in a tangent hyperplane
to a sphere; thus what we observe is that restrictin of l0 to the diagonals yields that
the states in a are eigenfunctions of the restricted to the diagonal laplacian

dx(a)[ii,0(1)] dx(a)[ii,0(1)],

(20)

xi

which is just a usual laplacian modulo terms with lower number of derivatives. thus
we obtain the following proposition 3.5.
1) the reduction of l0 in a to the diagonals is identically zero
2) the above is equivalent to the fact that the restriction of the usual laplacian to the
diagonals is zero on the subspace in h of solutions of the equation, given by the spin
operator plus lower in derivative terms

4 conclusions

we constructed canonical non-highest weight unitary irreducible representation of

cso(1, n) current algebra as well as canonical non-highest weight non-unitary repre-

sentations, we constructed certain laplacian operators in the universal enveloping
algebra, acting in representation space. we speculated about possible relation of
those laplacians with the loop operator for the yang-mills.
