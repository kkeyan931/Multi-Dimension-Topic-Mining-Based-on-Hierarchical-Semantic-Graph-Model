abstract

we consider the ads space formulation of the classical dynamics deriving

from the stuckelberg lagrangian. the on-shell action is shown to be free of

infrared singularities as the vector boson mass tends to zero. in this limit the

model becomes maxwell theory formulated in an arbitrary covariant gauge.

then we use the ads/cft correspondence to compute the two-point cor-

relation functions on the boundary. it is shown that the gauge dependence

concentrates on the contact terms.

as it is well known [1], maldacena has conjectured that the large n limit of a certain

conformal eld theory (cft) in a d-dimensional space can be described by string/m-theory

on adsd+1  k, where k is a suitable compact space. a precise form to this conjecture has
been given in refs. [2,3] according to which

zads[0] = z0 d exp(i[])  zcf t [0] = hexp(cid:18)z

ddxo0(cid:19)i ,

(1)

where 0 is the value taken by  at the boundary. by assumption 0 is also the external cur-

rent coupling to the operator o in the boundary cft. thus the knowledge of the partition
function in adsd+1 enables one to obtain the correlation functions of the boundary cft in d

dimensions. the ads/cft correspondence has been studied for scalar elds [37], massive

vector elds [8,9], spinor elds [8,10,11], the rarita-schwinger eld [1214], classical gravity

[15,16], massive symmetric tensor elds [17], antisymmetric p-form elds [18,19], type iib

string theory [20,21] and three dimensional eld theories with chern-simons terms [22].

the ads/cft correspondence is an example of the holographic principle [23] according

to which a quantum theory with gravity must be describable by a boundary theory. this

raises questions on how the detailed information of the theory in the bulk can be com-

pletely coded in a lower dimensional theory at the border. in fact this mechanism is still

not well understood and several aspects of it have recently been investigated. for instance,

the holographic bound, establishing that the boundary theory has only one bit of informa-

tion per planck area, manifests itself in the infrared-ultraviolet connection of the ads/cft

correspondence [24]. some situations involving superluminal oscillations and negative en-

ergy density have shown that there are hidden degrees of freedom which store information

but have no local energy density [25]. on more conservative grounds, known relationships

between eld theories in the bulk should emerge in the conformal theory at the boundary.

this has been veried explicitly for the case ads3/cf t2. in fact, the well known equiv-

alence between maxwell-chern-simons theory and the self-dual model in minkowski space

also holds in ads3 and, correspondingly, both models have been shown to lead to the same

conformal theory at the border [22].

2

another aspect of the holographic principle is concerned with the unphysical degrees

of freedom of a gauge theory in the bulk. one expects that the ads/cft correspondence

respects gauge invariance in the sense that the cft correlators are independent of the gauge

choice made in the bulk. since the correlators of the corresponding conformal theory have

conserved sources they do not carry information about the longitudinal modes of the gauge

eld. the conclusion would then be that there is no information about the unphysical gauge

degrees of freedom at the border, which in turn would invalidate the ads/cft correspon-

dence. in this work, we show that the gauge degrees of freedom do contribute but only to

the contact terms. to see how this come about, we shall consider an abelian gauge eld and

study the role played by the gauge dependent terms as far as the correlators at the border

are concerned.

thus we shall be looking for a formulation of electrodynamics in an arbitrary gauge when

the space-time background is adsd+1. as in the case of at minkowski space it will prove

convenient to start from the stuckelberg action

where f = a  a,  is the covariant derivative and a is a real positive constant.
electrodynamics in an arbitrary covariant gauge, specied by the constant a, is dened as
the limit m2  0 of stuckelberg theory. on the other hand the limit a  , while keeping
m2 > 0, results in the proca theory. the mass term in (2) will help us to control the infrared

divergent terms which will arise along the calculation.

as usual we take the representation of adsd+1 in poincare coordinates which describes

the half-space x0 > 0, xi  rd with the metric

since we are going to solve the equations of motion subjected to dirichlet boundary

conditions some care must be exercised when applying the variational principle to the action

(2). when we vary the action to obtain the equations of motion the boundary term

z ddx g(cid:18)f 0iai +

1

aaa0(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=

(5)

is generated. if the gauge xing term is not present then the boundary conditions must be

prescribed only for the spatial components of the potential ai. in the present case, however,

all components of the potential must be given at the border. then no additional bound-

ary terms are needed in the original action to cancel the one coming from the variational

principle.

the solving of the equations of motion is greatly simplied by the decomposition of a

into a scalar eld  and a vector eld u 

  a ,
u   a

these new elds satisfy, respectively, the equations of motion

u   m2u  = 0 ,

where u  u  u. clearly u  is a proca eld with mass m since u  = 0 .

as usual, we shall look for a bulk solution written in terms of boundary eld values

very end of the calculations. in particular, by returning with (8) and (9) into (6) one can

determine the unknowns  and vi in terms of the values assumed by a on the surface

in this paper we are interested in maxwell theory formulated in an arbitrary covariant
gauge. therefore we must investigate the limit m2  0 of (1214). from eqs.(10a) and
(10b) one nds, respectively, that the expansions

are valid up to terms of order m2. then from eqs.(11), (16) and (17) it follows that d(k)
vanishes as m2 goes to zero. in fact, it is straightforward to show that

this implies that /am2 and u develop infrared divergences. the question is now whether

d2 , which also vanishes as

the three terms in the second line of (20) are, individually, infrared divergent. however, by

using

(22d)

one nds that the divergent pieces cancel among themselves. through a similar analysis we

show that the third line in eq.(20) and the second and third lines in eq.(21) dene functions

of m2 which are regular at m2 = 0. to summarize, a(x) is indeed an analytic function of

m2 in the vicinity of m2 = 0.

we turn next into application of the ads/cft correspondence to compute the two-point

correlation function < o(~x)o(~y) > of the boundary cft. the dominant term in the path
integral in eq.(1) is the exponential of the classical action evaluated on-shell. after using

eqs.(2) and (4) one nds that

where f0i(x)  0 ai(x)  i a0(x) and  is the near-boundary surface x0 = . the explicit

correlators may only arise from those terms containing f,0i(~x) and  a0(x)/x0|x0=. we
shall therefore concentrate our attention on these objects.

where the argument k of the modied bessel functions has been omitted in order to simplify

and reproduce, as it must be the case, the result for the proca eld [8]. furthermore the

dangerous infrared behavior of d, showing up in the denominator of the last line of (24), is
again canceled by the factor  + 1  d/2 in the corresponding numerator, leaving us with
an overall function f,0i(~x) regular at m2 = 0.

since (a  d
2) and d are o(m2) the second term in the rst bracket of eq.(25) is o(m2)
and, therefore, it drops out in the zero mass limit. for the same reasons the term involving
1/d in the second bracket of (25) is regular in m2 = 0 which renders  a0(x)/x0|x0= free
of infrared divergences.

we shall next determine the contributions of each term in (24) and (25) to the action in
(23) and, therefore, to the correlators < o(~x)o(~y) >. we shall do this for m2 > 0, the
limit m2  0 being taken at the very end of the calculations.

clearly the rst line in the right hand side of (24) contributes with a contact term which

is independent of a. the second line in the right hand side of (24) gives the usual result for

the two point correlator after taking the usual prescription a0,(~x) = lim0  d a,(~x).
notice that   d is gauge independent. hence, at the limit a   we have u0,(~x) =
lim0  d u,(~x), which, as expected, reproduces the normalization prescription for the

proca eld [8]. then by taking into account the above normalization and using the ads/cft

correspondence one reads o the two-point correlators

< oi(~x)oj(~y) > (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)m2=0

(26)

in agreement with the results already obtained for this object in the case of the abelian

gauge eld [3,5].

the third line in the right hand side of eq.(24) only makes trivial contributions to

the two-point cft correlator. thus if < o(~x)o(~y) > contains at all a nontrivial gauge
dependent piece it can only originate in the last term of the right hand side of eq.(25) which,
as we already said, survives in the limit m2  0. however, an straightforward calculation
suces to show that all potentially dangerous powers of  cancel out among themselves and

the just mentioned term does not contribute to < o(~x)o(~y) > in the limit   0.

we then conclude that the gauge dependence concentrates on the contact terms while the

non-trivial part of the boundary conformal theory correlators turns out to be that already

found by working in a completely xed gauge [3,5] and displayed in eq.(26). another

important feature is that although we have xed all components of the potential at the

border the pieces containing a,0 give only contact terms and the only non-trivial pieces are

those containing a,i. therefore the boundary theory still retains information on the gauge

degrees of freedom of the bulk theory. this then lends further support to the holographic

principle. our result conrms the expectation that the ads/cft correspondence respects

9

gauge invariance and that the information about the unphysical degrees of freedom is not

lost in the border. this shows the importance of the contact terms which are usually ignored.
