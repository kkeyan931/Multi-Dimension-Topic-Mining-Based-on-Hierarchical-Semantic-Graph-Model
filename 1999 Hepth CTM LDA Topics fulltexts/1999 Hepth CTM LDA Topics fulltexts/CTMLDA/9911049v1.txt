1 introduction:

during the past few years many attempts to quantize general relativity were
unsuccessful and the divergence problem remain unsolvable. to cure this disap-
pointing problems,same temprogram solutions were proposed like supergravity
etc...
. however,it turns that despite the introduction of supersymmetry,the
latter was not enough to absorb the unwanted divergences appearing in the per-
turbative series expansion and solve the anomaly problem.

recently,a new theory based on the generalization of the space-time metric
was proposed and babtized nonsymmetric gravitation theory ngt [[1]-[8]]. it
is worth to mention that like general relativity all the classical predictions of
ngt were compatible with nowadays experimental data [[1]-[4]]. however,this is
enough to claim that one has at hands a consistent gravitation theory because
ngt is a classical theory. therefore,the construction of a quantum version of
this theory was necessary in order to study the renormalizability and anomaly
problems and test the compatibility of the theory. in fact,and recently,,the quan-
tization of ngt via the canonical operator formalism was considered and the
related theory was constructed [[9]-[12]]. it turns out that andes shown in ref.
[10],that the quantum ngt (qngt) contain a large symmetry which can be
considered as a rst indication to a probable renormalizable theory.

it is the purpose of this paper to study this large symmetry (called choral

symmetry) in a more general context of the super space and superalgebra.

in section 2.,we derive the gl(4,r) like superalgebra,in section 3.we derive
the noether supercurrent and in section 4 we discuss the spontaneous breakdown
of these symmetries. finally in section 5,we draw our conclusions.

2 gl(4,r) like superalgebra:

as it is shown in our ref.[10] that all of x, b,(cid:16) + e(cid:17) and(cid:18) + e(cid:19) satisfy

the same dalembert equation. it is therefore,convenient to deal with them in a
unied way. we set:

where

x =(cid:16)x, b, , (cid:17)

 =  + e
 =  + e

2

(2.1)

(2.2)



(b, , 
are the auxiliary b-eld,ghost and antighost respectively and the sym-
bol  means hyperbolic complex conjugate) and call x the sixteen-dimensional
supercoordinate because,as seen later,it naturally behaves like a sixteen-dimensions
extension of x,including grassmann-like transitional. where we need more then
one supercoordinates we use also the letters y, z, u, etc...

now, the equation [[9],[10]]:

(where bg  gg) are unied into:

evidently eq. (2.4) is a conservation law for

(cid:16)bgx(cid:17) = 0
 (bgb) = 0
(cid:16)bg(cid:17) = 0
(cid:16)bg(cid:17) = 0
 (bgx) = 0
 (x)  bg x

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

now, generalizing the structure of the m 
supercurrent:

,we nd the existence of a conserved

m  (x, y ) q (x, y )bg (xy   x.y )

where a coecient q (x, y ), dened below,is inserted for making m  (x, y )

hermitian.

(2.6)

in order to deal with both bosonic and fermionic quantities in a unied way,it

is convenient to introduce the following notation:

let:

 (a, b) =( 1 if both a and b are fermionic

otherwise

+1

(2.7)

hence,for instance,we can write [a, b] = ab   (a, b) ba. we set  (a) 
 (a, a), that is,  (a) = 1 for a bosonic and  (a) = 1 for a fermionic, then
we have a relation:

 (a, b) = 1

2 [1 +  (a) +  (b)   (a)  (b)]

the following properties are evident:

 (a, b) =  (b, a)
 (ac, b) =  (a)  (c, b)

(2.8)

(2.9)

thus, the  for a pair of products reduce to a product of the s for a pair of

single elds.

3

it is convenient to introduce a square root of the  by the articial convention

+1 = +1 and 1 = +i. there are various identities between products of

square roots of the s eq.

 (b)q (ab, b) = iq (a, b)

(2.10)

in order to make the sixteen-dimensional structure of the theory transparent,

we introduce the sixteen-dimensional supermetric  (x, y ) by

 (x, b) =  (b, x) = (cid:16), (cid:17) = (cid:16), (cid:17) = 

 (x, y ) = 0



otherwise

(2.11)

here x and y in  (x, y ) are regarded as mere indices,just like  and  in
. the 1616 matrix formed by  (x, y ) is non-diagonal,but its determinant
its equal to +1. hence we construct its matrix invasion,that is,we dene e (x, y )
by

xz

 (x, z)e (z, y ) =  (x, y )

where  (x, y ) denotes the sixteen dimensional kronecker delta function. ex-
plicitly,we have:

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

e (x, b) = e (b, x) = e(cid:16), (cid:17) = e(cid:16), (cid:17) = 
e (x, y ) = 0

now,from eq. (2.4) we have the following symmetry generators:



otherwise

p (x) z dx  0 (x)

m (x, y ) z dx m 0 (x, y )

here,x and y in p (x) and m (x, y ) are regarded as mere indices,just as in
 (x, z). from the denition,it is evident that:

m (y, x) =  (x, y ) m (x, y )

(2.15)

otherwise its components are independent. hence,m (x, y ) represents 128 sym-
metry generators. since p (x) represents 16,we have 144 symmetry generators
in total.

the symmetry generators represented in ref. [10] can be expressed as:

p = p (b)
m 
qb = m (b, )

 = m (x, b)  m(cid:16), (cid:17)

4

(2.16)

the fadeev popov (f.p). ghost number operator is given by:

now,if  is any primary eld other than b,  and  ,then one can show

q  m(cid:16), (cid:17)

(2.17)

that:

[ip (x) , ] =  (x, x) 

[ip (x) , z] = iq (x) (x, z) +  (x, x)  z
[im (x, y ) , ] =  (y, x) [x  x []
[im (x, y ) , z] =niq (xy, z) (y, z) +  (y, x) xz   (x, y ) (x  y )o

  (x  y )]

(2.18)

where []

 is dened as:

1si
h1r

 =

rxp =1

 1p 1p +1r
p

1s

+

q 1r


1q+1s

sxq=1

note that eqs. (2.18) vanish for z = x,as it should be. the 144 symmetry

generators,p (x) and m (x, y ),form the following superalgebra:

[p (x) , p (y )] = 0

[im (x, y ) , p (z)] =q (xy, z){ (y, z) p (x)   (x, y ) (x  y )}
[m (x, y ) , m (u, v )] =q (xy, u v ) {[ (y, u) m (x, v )   (u, v ) (u  v )]} 

 (x, y ) (x  y )

(2.19)
since the above (anti) commutation relations are quite similar to those of
gl (4, r) algebra,we call it the sixteen-dimensional gl (4, r) like superalgebra.

3 noether supercurrent for choral symmetry:

usually,given a symmetry rst,one then constructs a lagrangian density which
has that symmetry. but we are now proceeding in the reversed way. given a
-lagrangian density rst, we nd its symmetry.

the (anti) commutation relation (2.8) imply the following symmetry trans-

formations:

with:

x () = x ()  x (x) 
xy () = xy ()  xy (x)  

(3.1)

5

x () = 0

x (z) = iq (x) (x, z)
xy () = { (y, x) x   (x, x) y } []
xy (z) = iq (xy, z){ (y, z) x   (x, y )  (x, z) y }



we see that x (z) 6= 0 for z = x if and only if x = b,that is b is a
space-time symmetry (translation) and x for x 6= b is an internal symmetry.
likewise,xy is an internal symmetry if neither x or y is b, and it is a space time
symmetry otherwise. we call the totality of x and xy choral symmetry. thus
choral symmetry contains both space time and internal symmetries in complete
harmony.

we can directly chick the invariance of the action under choral-symmetry

transformations. we rst note (3.2) and

(3.2)

(3.3)

e =xx,y q (x) .e (x, y ) .x. y

then, we can see that (g) 1
2 m are re-
spectively invariant under x and xy . (g, gf and f p are the pure qngt the
gauge xing and faddeev-popov lagrangian density respectively) the existence
of choral symmetry uniquely characterizes our expression for gf + fp .

2 (gf + fp ) , and (g) 1

2 g , (g) 1

since we have found the symmetry transformations,it is now possible to con-
struct the noether supercurrents for choral symmetry . as it noted before,it is
sucient to consider xy only. the noether supercurrent corresponding to xy
is given by:



cm  (x, y )  xy (a)"
 (a)e + xy (x) e + xy (v  bgb)# (3.4)
where e stands for the total lagrangian o and
v  =(cid:16)bgg bgg(cid:17) g

first,we calculate the contribution from the clerical part,for which a 6=

b,, . substituting



xy () = xy (cid:16)x(cid:17) []
xy (v ) = xy (cid:16)x(cid:17) v   xy (cid:16)x(cid:17) . (

(m is the matter density lagrangian) . next,we calculate the contribution
from the gauge xing and f. p. ghost part,for which a runs over g, b, , 
only. it is straightforward to have

(3.7)
finally,we combine eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) by using eqs. (3.1),(3.2) and (2.10)(2.12)
in this order,we obtain

where m  (x, y ) is given by eq. (2.6) and

4 spontaneous breakdown of symmetries:

we now postulate the existence of a unique vacuum state | 0i,which has a positive
norm

then,from eqs. (2.18),we nd

h0 | 0i = 1





h0 | [ip (x) , b] | 0i = 
h0 |nip () , o | 0i = i
h0 |nip (cid:16)(cid:17) , o | 0i = i
h0 |nim (x, x) , 1
h0 |nim (x, ) , o | 0i = i
h0 |nim(cid:16)x, (cid:17) , o | 0i = i



2 (b  b)o | 0i =  (

)

(the symbol{}  means anti-commutator) thus the symmetries generated by
p (x) , p () , p(cid:16)(cid:17) , m (x, x) , m (x, ) and m(cid:16)x, (cid:17) are necessarily

spontaneously broken,and b, ,  must contain massless spectrum owing to
the goldstone theorem.

we postulate that the vacuum is invariant under translation

that is,translational invariance is not spontaneously broken. then we should
have

p | 0i = 0

in ref.[10],we show that no generality is lost by setting

h0 | g | 0i = 

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

for a = g , then eq. (4.4) becomes

hence eq.(4.5) implies that:

, gi = xa  [a]



hicm 
, gi = x g + 
hicm 
, gi | 0i = 
h0 |hicm 

 g + 

 g

g + 

 g

from eq. (4.6) we see that the symmetric part cm 

 is spon-
taneously broken,and the corresponding nambre-goldstone ng mode is nothing
but g . that is,gravitons and skewons must be exactly massless. on the other
hand,the antisymmetric part

 + cm 

cm 

 = cm 

  cm 



(4.7)

has the vanishing goldstone commutator. we thus see that the gl (4, r) invari-
ance is spontaneously broken.

the remaining generators m (b,b) , m (b,) , m(cid:16)b,(cid:17) , m(cid:16), (cid:17) ,
m (, ) and m(cid:16), (cid:17) have no reason for the spontaneous breakdown. hence

it is natural to suppose that they are unbroken. one can indeed conrm that the
ward-takahashi-type identities

h0 | [m (x, y ) , ] | 0i = o

(4.8)

hold,where  denotes a t-product of eld operators,for the above generators at
the tree and one -loop levels in perturbation theory.

for spontaneously broken generators, the ward-takahasli-type identities must
be modied by the contribution from the ng mode. by analyzing those modied
ward -takahshi type identities,one obtains various consistency conditions [13].

5 conclusions:

we conclude that through the constructed noether supercurrent and the related
superalgebra which reects the choral symmetry that qngt can be a good candi-
date of a consistent quantum theory of gravitation(more details are under investigation)[13].
