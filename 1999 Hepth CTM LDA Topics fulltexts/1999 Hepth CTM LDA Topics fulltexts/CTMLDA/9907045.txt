(2.1) lagrangian represents self-interacting scalar quantum eld theory d-dimensional euclidean space-time. vary action respect (x) obtain eld equation: 2(x) + m2(x) ign 1 = j(x). (2.2) next, leaving source turned on, take expectation value eld equation (2.2) vacuum state theory |0i divide vacuum-vacuum functional z = h0|0i: 2g(j) 1 (x) + m2g(j) 1 (x) gin h0|n 1(x)|0i h0|0i = j(x), (2.3) g(j) 1 (x) one-point greens function presence external source: 1 (x) h0|(x)|0i g(j) h0|0i . (2.4) note function j(x) appears alone right side eq. (2.3) c-number therefore factored matrix elements. objective use eq. (2.3) calculate greens functions theory. (connected) greens functions presence source j dened functional derivatives logarithm z respect source j(x): g(j) n (x1, x2, . . . , xn) n j(x1)j(x2) j(xn) ln(z). (2.5) obtain standard connected greens functions theory (the connected part vacuum expectation value time-ordered product elds; is, sum connected n-point feynman diagrams) turn source: gn(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = g(j) . (2.6) n (x1, x2, . . . , xn) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j0 note turning source restores translation invariance. result, one-point greens function g1 constant independent x, two-point greens function depends dierence x y, g2(x, y) = g2(x y), g3(x, y, z) = g3(x y, x z) depends two dierences, on. one proceed, one must express third term eq. (2.3) terms con- nected greens functions theory. recall functionally dierentiating respect j(x) equivalent inserting (x) matrix elements . let us consider simple case n = 3. case necessary calculate quantity h0|2(x)|0i. begin eq. (2.4) multiplied z: 4 taking functional derivative equation respect j(x) gives g(j) 1 (x)z = h0|(x)|0i. 2z + g(j) 2 (x, x)z = h0|2(x)|0i. hence, eliminate h0|2(x)|0i eq. (2.3) obtain 1 (x)]2 + g(j) 1 (x) + m2g(j) 2g(j) 1 (x) + gi(cid:16) = (x y). continue process functionally dierentiating respect j setting j 0, obtain innite tower coupled dierential equations known schwinger- dyson equations. example, third sequence (2.12) 2g3(x y, x z) + m2g3(x y, x z) +gi = 0. (2.13) note schwinger-dyson equations incomplete sense many unknowns. rst equation contains g1 g2, second contains g1, g2, g3, on. thus, new equation contains new unknown greens function system never closes. however, force system close truncating sequence coupled equations setting gn+1 = 0 last equation. use method throughout remainder paper. second example derive rst four schwinger-dyson equations eq. (2.3) case n = 4. using approach case n = 3, begin reexpressing h0|3(x)|0i. taking functional derivative eq. (2.8) respect j(x) obtain 3z + 3g(j) 1 (x)g(j) 2 (x, x)z + g(j) 3 (x, x, x)z = h0|3(x)|0i. (2.14) substituting result n = 4 version eq. (2.3), 5 1 (x) + m2g(j) 2g(j) obtain rst schwinger-dyson equation n = 4 setting j 0: 1 (x) g(cid:16)3 + 3g(j) 2 (x, x) + g(j) 1 (x)g(j) 3 (x, x, x)(cid:17) = j(x). (2.15) m2g1 ghg3 1 + 3g1g2(0) + g3(0, 0)i = 0. (2.16) using procedure n = 3 take functional derivative eq. (2.15) respect j(y) obtain 2g(j) +3g(j) 2 (x, y) + m2g(j) 1 (x)g(j) 2 (x, y) g(cid:16)32g(j) 2 (x, y) 2 (x, y) +g(j) 3 (x, x, y) + 3g(j) 4 (x, x, x, y)(cid:17) = (x y). now, setting j 0 gives second schwinger-dyson equations n = 4: 2g2(x y) + m2g2(x y) g = (x y). (2.17) (2.18) repeating process functionally dierentiating eq. (2.17) respect j(z) setting j 0 gives 2g3(x y, x z) + m2g3(x y, x z) g = 0, 1g3(x y, x z) (2.19) third schwinger-dyson equations n = 4. fourth schwinger-dyson equa- tion 2g4(x y, x z, x w) + m2g4(x y, x z, x w) g = 0. 1g4(x y, x z, x w) (2.20) again, observe set equations incomplete; case number unknown greens functions two number equations (instead one case n = 3). is, rst equation n = 4 contains three unknowns g1, g2, g3, second contains g1, g2, g3, g4, on. solve system equations truncate nth equation, close system equations must set gn+1 = 0 gn+2 = 0 last next last equations. generalize derivation arbitrary n? clearly, n integer n > 2 use two cases n = 3 n = 4 discussed paradigms. 6 needed functionally dierentiate eq. (2.7) n 2 times. gives expression h0|n 1(x)|0i eq. (2.3). example, n = 5 z(cid:16)4 + 62g(j) 3 (x, x, x) +g(j) 2 (x, x)]2 2 (x, x) + 3(cid:16)5 + 102g(j) 1 (x)g(j) 4 (x, x, x, x) + g(j) 1 (x)]3g(j) 2 (x, x) + 15g(j) 1 (x)2 3 (x, x, x) + 10g(j) 2 (x, x)g(j) 3 (x, x, x) 5 (x, x, x, x, x)(cid:17) = h0|5(x)|0i, on. calculation completed, repeated functional dierentiation respect j followed setting j 0 gives complete set coupled greens function equations. note equations rather complicated, easily expressible terms multinomial coecients. following notation abramowitz stegun , multinomial coecients dened follows: integer n, set multinomial coecients; coecient expresses number possible ways par- tition n = a1 + 2a2 + . . . + nan dierent objects ak subsets containing k objects (k = 1, 2, . . . , n). rst integers n sets multinomial coecients (called m3 ref. ) {1} n = 1, {1, 1} n = 2, {1, 3, 1} n = 3, {1, 4, 3, 6, 1} n = 4, {1, 5, 10, 10, 15, 10, 1} n = 5. observe precisely coecients appear (2.7) h0|(x)|0i, (2.8) h0|2(x)|0i, (2.14) h0|3(x)|0i, (2.21) h0|4(x)|0i, (2.22) h0|5(x)|0i. also, equations powers greens functions numbers ak. precise, n must take possible combinations numbers ak satisfying n = a1 + 2a2 + . . . + nan. notation ref. , = 1a1, 2a2, . . . , nan. allows us read subscripts greens functions powers raised; numbers ak powers numbers exponentiate subscripts greens functions term. calculate quantity m3 = (n; a1, a2, . . . , an) = n!
