abstract

we apply a superspace formulation to the four-dimensional gauge theory of

a massless abelian antisymmetric tensor eld of rank 2. the theory is formu-

lated in a six-dimensional superspace using rank-2 tensor, vector and scalar

superelds and their associated supersources. it is shown that brs transfor-

mation rules of elds are realized as euler-lagrange equations without assum-

ing the so-called horizontality condition and that a generating functional w

constracted in the superspace reduces to that for the ordinary gauge theory of

abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld. the wt identity for this theory

is derived by making use of the superspace formulation and is expressed in a

neat and compact form  w / = 0.

i. introduction

gauge theories of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor elds have become eld of interest

for various reasons. kalb and ramond rst realized that abelian rank-2 antisymmetric

tensor elds could interact with classical strings [1]. this interaction has been applied to

the lorentz-covariant description of vortex motion in an irrotational, incompressible uid [2],

and to the dual formulation of the abelian higgs model [3]. abelian rank-2 antisymmetric

tensor elds are also involved in supergravity multiplets [4] and in excited states of quantized

(super)strings [5]. they are crucial for superstring theories to realize anomaly-cancellation

mechanism and to estimate dualities in extended objects. in addition, it has been shown

that an abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld generates eective mass for an abelian

vector gauge eld through a topological coupling between these two elds [6]. a geometric

aspect of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor elds has been discussed in a u(1) gauge

theory in loop space [7].

covariant quantization of an abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld was rst at-

tempted by townsend [8] and has been studied by many authors [9,10] in systematic man-

ners based on the becchi-rouet-stora (brs) formalism.

it was found in the covariant

quantization that a naive gauge-xing term containing the antisymmetric tensor eld is it-

self invariant under a secondary gauge transformation and that commuting ghost elds are

required for complete gauge xing.

in the present paper, we consider a superspace formulation of the four-dimensional gauge

theory of a massless abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld. until recently, the brs

formalism for abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor elds has been discussed by several

authors using superelds on a six-dimensional superspace [10]. however, in these superspace

formulations, brs transformation rules of elds are put in by hand and superelds are not

free but are constrained to satisfy the so-called horizontality condition. as a consequence,

covariance of the superelds is spoiled under superspace rotations that mix spacetime and

anticommuting coordinates.

2

to avoid these limitations, we apply the superspace formulation proposed by joglekar

[11] to the gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld. this formulation also

uses a six-dimensional superspace but has remarkable features: (i) unlike earlier superspace

formulations [10,12], superelds are not a priori restricted by the horizontality conditions

and superspace rotations can be carried out; brs transformation rules are realized as euler-

lagrange equations. (ii) the theory in superspace is constructed by taking into account

generalized gauge invariance and the lagrangian density (without gauge-xing and source

terms) is a scalar under osp(3, 1|2) transformations in the superspace.

(iii) the whole

action including all source terms is accommodated in a single action written in terms of

superelds. for details see ref. [13]. after the application, we show that the generating

functional in the superspace formulation contains in itself all the necessary information of the

generating functional for the ordinary gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor

eld. we further show that brs transformation rules can be obtained without assuming

the horizontality condition and that the wt identity for the theory can be expressed in

a neat, compact, and mathematically convenient form  w / = 0. this will lead to a

simplied treatment of the renormalization problem in the gauge theory of abelian rank-2

antisymmetric tensor eld.

the present paper is organized as follows. we briey review the gauge theory of abelian

rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld in sec.iia and provide for the superspace formulation in

sec.iib. in sec.iii, we apply the superspace formulation proposed in ref. [11] to the gauge

theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld and construct a generating functional

from superelds. we show that this generating functional reduces to one considered in

the ordinary gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld. in sec.iv, we see

that brs transformation rules are realized as euler-lagrange equations. we also discuss

a relation between the brs transformation and a six-dimensional gauge transformation.

in sec.v, we derive a simple form of the wt identity by making use of the supereld

formulation. section vi is devoted to a summary and discussion.

ii. preliminary

a. gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld

in this section, we briey review the gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor

eld. let b(x) be an abelian antisymmetric tensor eld on four-dimensional minkowski

space m 4 with a space-time coordinate system (x) ( = 0, 1, 2, 3). we consider the abelian

gauge theory dened by the action

s0 =

1

12 z d4xff ,

(2.1)

where d4x  dx0dx1dx2dx3 and f  b + b + b. this action is invariant

under the gauge transformation b =    with a vector gauge parameter (x).

to covariantly quantize b using the brs formalism [9,10], it is necessary to introduce

the following ghost and auxiliary elds: anticommuting vector elds (x) and (x), a

commuting vector eld (x), anticommuting scalar elds (x) and (x), and commuting

scalar elds (x), (x) and (x). the brs transformation  is dened for b by replacing

 in the gauge transformation by the ghost eld , and for other elds it is dened so as

to satisfy the nilpotency condition 2 = 0 :

b =   

 = i ,

 = 0 ,

  = i ,

 = 0 ,

 =  ,

  = 0 ,

 =  ,

 = 0 .

covariant quantization of b can be performed with the action

with the gauge-xing terms

s = s0 + s1 + s2 ,

4

(2.2)

(2.3)

s1 = iz d4x [(b + k1)] ,
s2 = iz d4x [ + (   k2 )] ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

where k1 and k2 are gauge parameters. owing to the nilpotency property of , these gauge-

xing terms are invariant under the brs transformation. the rst term s1 breaks the gauge

invariance of s0 explicitly. the second term s2 is necessary to break the invariance of s1 un-

der the secondary gauge transformation  = ,   =  . the gauge-xing procedure

for quantization of b is complete with s1 + s2. carrying out the brs transformation in

eqs. (2.4) and (2.5), we obtain

s1 + s2 = z d4x[i (  ) + 

+(b + k1  )

i   i(   k2 )] .

(2.6)

the action s describes a massless system. we can read from s how many physical

degrees of freedom b has: the total degrees of freedom of the commuting elds b,

, ,  and  are naively 13, but some of them are not independent because of the four

constraints b + k1   = 0 derived from s. their genuine degrees of freedom are

thus 9. the total degrees of freedom of the anticommuting elds  ,  and  are naively

10, but some of them are also not independent because of the two constrains  = 0 and

  k2  = 0 derived from s. their genuine degrees of freedom are thus 8. subtracting the

genuine degrees of freedom of the anticommuting elds from those of the commuting elds,

we conclude that b has one physical degree of freedom, describing a spin less particle.

b. superspace and superelds

we shall work in a superspace of six dimensions. the superspace used in this paper

possesses a local coordinate system (xi)  (x, , ) (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) with anticommuting

real coordinates x4   and x5  , and will be denoted by m 4/2. we introduce to m 4/2 a

metric tensor gij whose non-vanishing components are

5

g00 = g11 = g22 = g33 = g45 = g54 = 1 .

(2.7)

the set of linear homogeneous transformations that leave gij xi xj invariant forms the pseudo-

orthosymplectic supergroup osp(3, 1|2). this is nothing but a supersymmetric generaliza-

tion of the lorentz group.

let x(x) = x(x, , ) be an arbitrary supereld on m 4/2. 1 since  and  are nilpotent,

x can be expanded as

x(x) = x(x) + x(x) + x(x) + x(x) ,

(2.8)

where x, x, x and x are component elds on m 4. in terms of

x,(x) 

x,(x) 

 x(x)



 x(x)



= x(x) + x(x) ,

= x(x)  x(x) ,

(2.9)

and x(x), eq. (2.8) is written as

x(x) = x(x) +  x,(x) +  x,(x)  x(x) .

(2.10)

here 

 and 

 denote left derivatives. equation (2.10) can be regarded as a constraint in
the ve elds x, x, x,, x, and x ; we now choose x  ( x, x,, x,, x) as a set of

independent elds.

let us dene

f  z d4xf (x (x), x (x))

(2.11)

from a polynomial f in x and x . for an arbitrary function f of f , we can readily show

that

d x(x)d x,(x)d x,(x)dx(x)f

z yx
= z yx

dx(x)dx(x)dx(x)dx(x)f .

(2.12)

1in this paper we shall attach overbar to all the superelds on m 4/2.

6

equation (2.12) holds whether x is a commuting supereld or an anticommuting supereld.

it should be noted that the integration in eq. (2.11) and the multiplication in eq. (2.12)

are carried out over m 4, not over m 4/2. consequently, eq. (2.12) is still a function of  and

. if f does not depend on x and x, we can formally divide the both sides of eq.

(2.12) by r qx dx(x), arriving at

d x(x)d x,(x)d x,(x)f

z yx
= z yx

dx(x)dx(x)dx(x)f .

(2.13)

using this formula twice, we have



 z yx
= z yx

d x(x)d x,(x)d x,(x)f

d x(x)d x,(x)d x,(x)

f


.

(2.14)

this is an important formula used in the superspace formulation of gauge theories.

iii. action and generating functional in superspace

in this section, we apply the supereld formulation proposed by joglekar [11] to the

gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld. to this end, we now gener-

alize the antisymmetric tensor eld b(x) to a supereld bij(x) on m 4/2 satisfying the

antisymmetric property in superspace, bij = (1)|i||j| bji, and the commuting property

xk bij = (1)|k|(|i|+|j|) bij xk. here |i| is a function of i, dened as |i| = 0 for i = 0, 1, 2, 3,

and |i| = 1 for i = 4, 5. the supereld bij is assumed to transform as a rank-2 covariant

tensor under coordinate transformations characterized by osp(3, 1|2). the eld strength of

bij is dened by

fijk  i bjk + (1)|i|(|j|+|k|)j bki + (1)|k|(|i|+|j|)k bij ,

which is invariant under the generalized gauge transformation

 bij = i j  (1)|i||j|j i

7

(3.1)

(3.2)

with a vector gauge parameter i(x) satisfying the commuting property xk i =

(1)|k||i| ixk. we consider the following generalization of the action (2.1):

s0 = 

1

12 z d4x f ijk(x) fkji(x) .

(3.3)

note that the integration above is carried out over m 4. obviously, s0 is invariant under the

gauge transformation (3.2).

in addition to bij, we introduce a vector supereld i(x) satisfying the anticommuting

property xk i = (1)|k|(|i|+1) ixk and a commuting scalar supereld (x). furthermore,

we introduce supersources (source superelds) k ij(x), ti(x) and u(x) which are associated

with the superelds bij, i and , respectively.
k ij bji, iti and u are anticommuting scalars under osp(3, 1|2) transformations; that is,

it is assumed that the (inner) products

k ij is an anticommuting tensor supersource, ti a commuting vector supersource, and u an

anticommuting scalar supersource.

the superspace formulation of the gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor

eld is begun with the action

s = s0 + sgs

with the gauge-xing and source terms

sgs = z d4x



" k ij(x) bji(x)

+i(x){i

 b(x) + k1i

  

,(x) + ti(x)}

+(x){

 (x) + k2

4,(x) + u(x)}# ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

where  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and k1 and k2 are gauge parameters.

let us collectively denote the superelds by (x) and the supersources by (x):  =

( bij, i, ) and  = ( k ij, ti, u). in accordance with the discussion in sec.2.2, we treat (x),

,(x) and ,(x) as a set of independent elds, and (x) and ,(x) as a set of independent

sources. (the eld (x) and the sources ,(x) and (x) do not occur at this stage.)

now, dening the path-integral measure

8

{d }  d d ,d , ,

with

d   yx
d ,  yx

d (x) ,

d ,(x) , d ,  yx

d ,(x) ,

we consider the generating functional

w [ , , ; ,  ] = z {d bij}{d i}{d } exp(i s) .

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

since the integrations in eqs. (3.3) and (3.5) and the multiplications in eq. (3.7) are carried

out over m 4, the generating functional w should be understood to be a function of  and

 as well as a functional of  and ,.

the integrations over bij, and bij, in eq. (3.8) lead to a form of w that is proportional

toqi,x ( k 4i(x)). then, carrying out the integrations over bi4, 5, i,, 5,, and ,, we nally

arrive at

w = n yi,x

( k 4i(x))( k 4i

z d m exp(i s) ,

(t4(x))(t4,(x))

,(x))yx

(3.9)

where n is a constant,

d m  d bd b5d b55d d 4d ,d 4,d d , ,

(3.10)

and

with

s = s

we also consider the generating functional w dened by

(3.15)

w = n yi,x

(t4(x))(t4,(x))w .

(3.16)

integrating eq. (3.16) over k 4i, k 4i

,, t4 and t4,, we have

w = z d k 4id k 4i

,dt4dt4, w .

(3.17)

b = b ,

b5 = i ,

b55 = 2i ,

, = i ,

(3.18)

at  =  = 0, eqs. (3.12) and (3.13) agree with eqs. (2.1) and (2.6), respectively. hence, the

ordinary gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld is correctly reproduced

up to the gauge-xing terms from the superspace formulation characterized by the action

10

s. in addition, the source term s and the generating functional w have the same forms

as those in the ordinary gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld. the

generating functional w has a neat form, while w is directly related to the ordinary gauge

theory, although w is still a function of  and . these functional are related to each other

by eqs. (3.16) and (3.17).

we now mention a dierence between earlier superspace formulations [10] and our su-

perspace formulation: in the earlier formulations, all the components of bij except b are

identied with the ghost elds , , ,  and . on the other hand, in our formulation,

only two components b5 and b55 are identied with the ghost elds  and , while the

other components except b are treated as auxiliary elds. instead, , 4 and  are iden-

tied with ghost elds ,  and , respectively. as will be seen in the next section, the

treatment of bij in our formulation makes possible to determine brs transformation rules

without assuming the so-called horizontality condition.

iv. brs transformation and six-dimensional gauge

transformation

we shall see in this section that some of the brs transformation rules can be realized as

the euler-lagrange equations and that a six-dimensional gauge transformation is related to

the brs transformation. taking into account eq. (3.18), we dene the brs transformation

rules of the superelds so that they can reduce to eq. (2.2):

and

 b = i b5 + i b5

 b5 =

i
2

 b55 ,

 b55 = 0 ,

  = i, ,

 , = 0 ,

 4 = i4, ,

 4, = 0 ,

(4.1)

  = i, ,

 , = 0 .

(4.2)

11

the transformation rules (4.2) indicate that the brs transformation  may be represented as

the derivative with respect to . if the equations  b5   b5 =  b, ,  b55 = 2 b5, ,

and b55, = 0 are satised, the brs transformation dened by eqs.

(4.1) and (4.2) is

represented as

 = i




.

(4.3)

remarkably, these desirable equations are derived from the action (3.4) as the euler-

lagrange equations for b,, b4, and b44, :

=

( b, +  b5   b5) = 0 ,

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

note here that the superelds are functions of x,  and , while s is a function of  and

. it should be emphasized that with eq. (4.3), the brs transformation rules (4.1) can be

obtained as the euler-lagrange equations. this situation is quite dierent from that in the

earlier superspace formulations, in which the brs transformation rules are determined by

putting in the horizontality condition by hand.

we now extend the brs transformation to the superelds b4, b44 and b45, utilizing

eq. (4.3) and the euler-lagrange equations

= 2 b45,  b55, = 0 .

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

since ssg in eq. (3.4) does not contain the superelds bij,, eqs (4.4)-(4.9) can collectively

be written as

 s0
 bij,

= 0 .

12

(4.10)

we can understand eq. (4.10) as the brs transformation rule of bij.

now, choosing the gauge parameter i in eq. (3.2) to be a particular form

i(x) = bi5(x) ,

we dene the six-dimensional gauge transformation

 bij = (i bj5  (1)|i||j|j bi5) ,

(4.11)

(4.12)

where  is an anticommuting innitesimal constant. using eqs. (4.4)-(4.9), we readily show

that

 bij =  bij, = 

 bij


.

dierentiations of eq. (4.13) with respect to  and  lead to

 bij, = 

 bij, = 

 bij,


 bij,


,

.

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

as seen from eqs. (4.3) and (4.13)-(4.15), the six-dimensional gauge transformation  for bij,

bij, and bij, is nothing other than the brs transformation for them with the parameter

i. note that eq.(4.15) vanishes because of 2/2 = 0 or the nilpotency property of the

brs transformation.

v. wt identity

in this section we derive the wt identity for the gauge theory of abelian rank-2 anti-

symmetric tensor eld by making use of the superspace formulation discussed above. since

s0 is a functional of the superelds bij, bij, and bij,, the use of eqs.(4.13)-(4.15) gives

 s0 = 

 s0


.

(5.1)

then, noting the invariance of s0 under the gauge transformation (4.12), we have

13

 s0


= 0 ,

(5.2)

which shows the brs invariance of s0. dierentiating eq. (3.8) with respect to , we obtain

 w


= z {d bij}{d i}{d }
= z {d bij}{d i}{d }i



 s0


exp(i s)

exp(i s) ,

where the formula (2.14) has been applied. from eq. (5.2), it follows that

 w


= 0 .

(5.3)

(5.4)

instead of using the six-dimensional gauge invariance of s0, we can show eq.

(5.4) by

directly calculating the last term of eq. (5.3). in this alternative method, eld theoretical

analogies of the formula (x  y)(x  y) = 0 are repeatedly used.

dierentiation of eq. (3.17) with respect to  is simply written as

by taking into account  k 4i

w

,) =

r dt4,dt4,f2(t4,) = 0 satised for arbitrary functions f1 and f2. as a result, eq. (5.4)

gives

w

on the other hand, calculating w / from the expression (3.15), we obtain

(5.6)

(5.7)

we now introduce sources j , j , j, j and j on m 4 that are dened, at  =  = 0, by

j  = i k 

,, j  = 2i k 5

,, j = t

,, j = t5, and j = iu,. with these sources and eq.

(3.18), it follows from eqs. (5.6) and (5.7) that

z d4xz dm [j (  )
+j  + j + j  + ji = 0 ,

(5.8)

where

dm  dbddd ddd dd .

(5.9)

this is nothing other than the wt identity in the ordinary gauge theory of abelian rank-2

antisymmetric tensor eld. hence, eq. (5.6) is understood as the wt identity.

dierentiating eq. (3.16) with respect to , we have

 w


= n yi,x

( k 4i(x))( k 4i

,(x))yx

(t4(x))(t4,(x))

w


,

(5.10)

where {( k 4i)( k 4i

,)}/ = ( k 4i) k 4i

,( k 4i

,) = 0 and {(t4)(t4,)}/ =

(t4)t4,(t4,) = 0 have been used. from eqs.

(5.5) and (5.10), we see that eq. (5.4)

is equivalent to eq. (5.6). therefore eq. (5.4) is considered the wt identity written in

terms of the superspace formulation.

vi. summary and discussion

in this paper, we have found that the superspace formulation proposed by joglekar

works well not only in the yang-mills theory but also in the gauge theory of abelian rank-

2 antisymmetric tensor eld. as we have seen, all information on the quantization of an

abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld is contained in the simple generating functional

w in eq. (3.8), with which the wt identity is expressed in a compact and elegant form

 w


= 0 .

15

(6.1)

in the superspace formulation of yang-mills theory, the wt identities are also cast in

the same form as eq. (6.1) [14]. it was shown in ref. [15] that this simple form can directly

be derived from partial osp(3, 1|2) invariance of the generating functional w dened in the

superspace formulation of yang-mills theory. furthermore, several subjects concerning the

renormalization of yang-mills theory [16] and generalizations of the brs transformation [17]

have been studied in the context of the superspace formulation of yang-mills theory. based

on the superspace formulation considered in the present paper, we will be able to extend the

discussions in ref.[15-17] to the gauge theory of abelian rank-2 antisymmetric tensor eld.

the superspace formulation can readily be applied to the gauge theories of abelian

antisymmetric tensor elds of higher rank. it is also possible to generalize the superspace

formulation in the present paper to several of the gauge theories containing both the yang-

mills and rank-2 antisymmetric tensor elds. one of such theories is the theory involving

the chapline-manton coupling [18] that is dened by the action

is a non-abelian antisymmetric tensor eld, 

a a non-abelian vector eld, m a constant

with dimensions of mass, and d denotes the covariant derivative dened from a

a.

in

addition to the theories dened by the lagrangians (6.2) and (6.3), there are gauge theories

with topological terms consisting of the yang-mills and antisymmetric tensor elds [20,21].

to apply the superspace formulation proposed by joglekar to those theories, it is necessary

to consider how topological terms are dened in the superspace.
