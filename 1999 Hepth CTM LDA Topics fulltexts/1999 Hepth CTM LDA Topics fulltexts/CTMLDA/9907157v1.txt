abstract

we construct non-bps dyon solutions of n = 4 su (n ) supersymmetric yang-mills
theory. these solutions are the worldvolume solitons which describe non-bps type
iib non-planar string junctions connecting n parallel d3-branes. the solutions are
smooth deformations of the 1/4 bps states which describe planar string junctions.

1 introduction

solitons in gauge theories have a geometric interpretation as worldvolume solutions
describing the intersection of various brane congurations. for example, the su(2) bps
monopole describes a d-string stretched between two d3-branes and this can be seen
explicitly by graphing the eigenvalues of the higgs eld over r3 [5]. the worldvolume
theory of n parallel d3-branes is n = 4 u(n) super-yang-mills and the 6n vacuum
expectation values (vevs) of the higgs scalars give the positions of the d3-branes in the
six-dimensional space which is transverse to the worldvolume of the d3-branes [16]. the
su(n) dyon solutions (an overall u(1) decouples as the centre of mass) describe bound
states of d-strings and fundamental strings stretched between the d3-branes.

the string spectrum also contains states, known as string junctions, in which three or
more strings meet at a point [13, 1, 4, 14]. if the string junction is planar, then it can
preserve 1/4 of the underlying supersymmetry and it has been demonstrated [2] that these
states correspond to 1/4 bps dyons in n = 4 su(n) super-yang-mills, where n  3.
recently classical dyon solutions have been constructed [6, 7, 11, 12] which correspond to
these planar string junctions. furthermore, it is expected that if n  4 then there exist
stable non-bps states, which correspond to string junctions connecting four or more d3-
branes which are non-planar [3]. in this paper we present a class of static non-bps dyon
solutions which describe such non-planar string junctions. they are smooth deformations
of the 1/4 bps states which describe planar string junctions.

the bosonic part of the (3+1)-dimensional n = 4 su(n) supersymmetric yang-mills

lagrangian is

l = tr{

ff  +

6xi=1

1
2

[i , j ]2}

6xi,j =1

(2.1)

where i, i = 1, .., 6 are the six higgs scalars and di = i  i[a, i ]. the equations
of motion which follow from (2.1) are

i=1[i , [i, j ]]

i=1 i[i , dji ]

(2.2)
(2.3)
(2.4)

didij = d0d0j +p6
difij  d0ej =p6

diei =p6

i=1 i[i , d0i]

where latin subscripts run over the space indices 1,2,3 and we recognise the last equation
as gauss law for the electric eld ei = f0i.

from (2.2) it is clear that a consistent reduction can be made by setting any of the
higgs scalars to zero. if we work with m  6 active scalars, ie. m +1 = . . . = 6 = 0,
then in the gauge a0 = 1 the static version of the above equations reduces to

didij =

[i, [i , j ]], difij =

mxi=2

mxi=2

i[dji , i].

(2.5)

2

in this gauge ei = di1 and d0i = i[i , 1] so gauss law is equivalent to the rst
equation in (2.5) with j = 1.

from the above it is now clear that the case m = 2 is very special, since in this case

the equations reduce to

didi2 = 0, difij = i[dj2, 2], didi1 = [2, [2, 1]].

(2.6)

the rst two equations are the usual ones for a yang-mills theory with a single higgs eld
and hence are solved by any static monopole solution of the bogomolny equation

di2 = bi

(2.7)

where bi = 1
2ijkfjk is the magnetic eld. the nal equation in (2.6) is then a linear
equation for 1 in the background of the monopole. given the higgs vevs for 1 and 2
(which give the positions of the n d3-branes in a two-dimensional space transverse to the
d3-brane worldvolume) then for each solution of the bogomolny equation (2.7) there is a
unique solution to the linear equation for 1, from which the electric charge of the dyons
can be calculated. these are the 1/4 bps states which have been constructed recently
[6, 7, 11, 12], following their predicted existence from string theory as the worldvolume
solitons describing planar string junctions [2]. due to the fact that the solutions (for xed
higgs vevs) are parametrized by bogomolny monopoles then expressions for the mass and
electric charge of these 1/4 bps states can be obtained as functions on the monopole
moduli space [15, 8].

to describe non-planar string junctions requires at least three active scalars, in order
to assign positions to the d3-branes which are not co-planar in the transverse space. with
three active scalars, ie. m = 3, equations (2.5) become

didi2 = [3, [3, 2]]
didi3 = [2, [2, 3]]
difij = i[dj2, 2] + i[dj3, 3]
didi1 = [2, [2, 1]] + [3, [3, 1]].

(2.8)
(2.9)
(2.10)
(2.11)

the nal equation is again a linear equation for 1 (which determines the electric eld) in
the background of the other elds. however, the remaining equations are more complicated
than the usual equations for a yang-mills theory with a single higgs scalar and are not
solved by rst order bogomolny equations (except for special cases such as 3 = 0, when
the string junction is again planar and we recover the 1/4 bps states). this is to be
expected since it is known from string theory that non-planar string junctions break all
supersymmetries and hence it is no surprise that we need to look for non-bps congurations
which are solutions of the full second order equations rather than rst order bogomolny
equations. in the next section we shall present some solutions of equations (2.8)(2.11),
which describe non-planar string junctions.

3 the harmonic map ansatz

in this section we shall construct spherically symmetric dyon solutions of equations

(2.8)(2.11) using the harmonic map approach introduced in [10].

coordinates r, z, z are used on r3, where r is the radial coordinate and z is the riemann
sphere angular coordinate given by z = ei tan(/2), where ,  are the standard angular
coordinates on the two-sphere. in terms of these coordinates equations (2.5) become

(dzdzj + dzdzj ) =

mxi=2

(3.2)

(3.3)

the harmonic map ansatz to obtain su(n) dyons is a simple generalization of the one
employed in [10] and is given by

i =

i
j (pj 

1
n

n 2xj=0

), az = i

n 2xj=0

j[pj, zpj], ar = 0.

(3.4)

here i
j (r), j(r) are real functions depending only on the radial coordinate r, and pj(z, z)
are n  n hermitian projectors, that is, pj = p 
j , which are independent of the
radius r. the set of n  1 projectors are taken to be orthogonal, so that pipj = 0 for i 6= j.
note that we are working in a real gauge, so that az = a
z. in (3.4), and for the remainder
of the paper, we drop the summation convention.

j = p 2

the orthogonality of the projectors pj means that the higgs elds i are mutually
commuting, ie. [i , j ] = 0, so they are simultaneously diagonalizable and this allows the
eigenvalues to be interpreted as the positions of the strings in the transverse space.

the explicit form of the projectors is given as follows. let f be the holomorphic vector

f = (f0, ..., fj, ..., fn 1)t, where fj = zjvuut n  1
j !

(3.5)

and (cid:16)n 1

h  c n as

j (cid:17) denote the binomial coecients. dene the operator , acting on a vector

then pj is dened as

h = zh 

h (h zh)

|h|2

pj =

(jf )(jf )

|jf |2

.

(3.6)

(3.7)

the particular form of these projectors corresponds to the requirement that the associated
dyons are spherically symmetric (see [10] for more details).

as stated above, these projectors form an orthogonal set, and have a number of other

special properties, such as the fact that each of them solves the harmonic map equation

[p, zzp ] = 0

(3.8)

of the two-dimensional cpn 1 sigma model (see [17] for more details). using these prop-
erties it can be shown (the analysis follows almost immediately from that given in [10])
that substitution of the ansatz (3.4) into the equations (3.1),(3.2),(3.3) results in a set of
coupled ordinary dierential equations for the prole functions i
j (r), j(r). in fact it is
convenient to make a change of variables to the following linear combinations

i
j =

n 2xk=j

bi
k,

cj = 1  j  j+1,

for j = 0, . . . , n  2

(3.9)

where we have dened n 1 = 0.

the magnetic charges, nk, for k = 1, .., n 1, can be read o from the large r behaviour

of the magnetic eld

where g is in the gauge orbit of

bi  bxi
2r2 g

(3.10)

g0 = diag(n1, n2  n1, . . . , nn 1  nn 2, nn 1).

(3.11)

in the case of maximal symmetry breaking, which we shall consider here, they are given
by [9]

similarly, the large r asymptotics of the electric eld

nk = k(n  k),

k = 1, ..., n  1.

(3.12)

(3.13)

ei  bxi
2r2 h

allow the electric charges (which classically are real-valued) to be found from the eigenvalues
of h. from our ansatz

h =

n 2xj=0

2(pj 

1
n

)(r2 1
j

)|r=

(3.14)

so the electric charges are related to the 1/r coecients of b1

j in a large r expansion.

we shall now restrict to the simplest case in which a non-planar string junction can
exist, that is m = 3 active scalars, as described earlier. the lowest rank gauge group we
can consider is su(4), corresponding to the fact that we require at least four d3-branes
otherwise they will always be co-planar. in this case the equations for the prole functions
are (for i = 1, 2, 3)

(3.15)

the boundary conditions at r = 0 are that bi
j (0) = 0 and cj(0) = 1 for all i, j, which ensures
that the higgs elds and gauge potential are regular at the origin. we shall restrict to
the case of maximal symmetry breaking su(4)  u(1)3, (corresponding to the four d3-
branes being distinct in transverse space), in which case the boundary conditions on cj(r)
at innity are cj() = 0, for all j. the remaining free parameters, bi
j (), required to
specify a unique solution to the set of equations (3.15), determine the vevs of the higgs
scalars as follows. evaluating the ansatz (3.4) along the positive x3-axis, which corresponds
to setting z = 0, and using the change of variables (3.9), results in

(3.17)

then the positions of the four d3-branes in the three-dimensional transverse space are given
by

(x4

) = (1

())

for  = 1, 2, 3, 4.

(3.18)

applying equation (3.18) for nite values of r gives the positions of the strings forming the
string junction and ending on the d3-branes.

before considering non-planar string junctions it is perhaps instructive to see how the
su(4) 1/4 bps solutions [7, 11], which describe planar junctions, are obtained in this
formalism. to construct a planar junction we place the d3-branes in the (x4, x5)-plane; as
an example we shall take the positions (3.18) to be

2) = (18, 1, 0)
3) = (14, 1, 0)
4) = (10, 3, 0).

(3.19)

these give the higgs vevs (via (3.18)) and using the formula (3.16) the boundary conditions
are found to be

graphing the positions of the strings, using (3.18), results in the planar string junction

displayed in figure 1; the squares denote the positions of the d3-branes.

for general values of the higgs vevs, corresponding to non-planar junctions, it is not
expected that the solution of (3.15) can be found in closed form. however, it is a relatively
simple task to obtain the solution numerically using a gradient ow algorithm with a nite
dierence scheme. as a simple example, we take the positions of the d3-branes to be

plotted in figure 2 (the individual functions can be identied by their asymptotic values).
in figure 3 we graph the positions of the strings corresponding to this non-planar string
junction.

if the string junction is non-planar, but is close to a planar junction, then an approxi-

as we have seen, for junctions which are close to being planar, approximate solutions
can be obtained by solving linear equations in the background of a bps monopole cong-
uration. thus it should be possible to nd an expression, as a function on the monopole
moduli space, for the leading order contribution to the mass of deforming a planar junction.
since non-planar junctions are non-bps states then they are not protected from quantum
corrections by supersymmetry, so it would perhaps be worthwhile to investigate further
the properties of such states which are perturbations of 1/4 bps congurations.

4 conclusion

we have described the construction of a class of static non-bps dyon solutions of
n = 4 su(n) supersymmetric yang-mills theory, whose existence was predicted by string
theory, in which they describe non-planar string junctions connecting n d3-branes [3].
the solutions we have presented here are spherically symmetric and their electric charge
is determined by the higgs vevs. the same situation arises for 1/4 bps states describing
planar junctions [6, 7, 11] and subsequently more general non-spherical solutions were found
[12] containing parameters that allow the electric charge to take a range of values. these
more general solutions are required in order to make contact with the quantum theory,
since the classical electric charge takes real values but must be restricted to integer values
upon quantization. it would therefore be useful to nd the generalization of our spherical
solutions, corresponding to separating the individual monopoles, though this task may be
rather dicult given the non-bps nature of the solutions.

8

string theory predicts that non-planar string junctions should be stable congurations,
despite the fact that they are non-bps states [3]. we therefore expect that the yang-mills
dyons we have presented are stable solutions and it would be interesting to investigate
this issue. although the methods we have used are based upon those developed to nd
non-bogomolny monopoles [10], which are expected to be unstable, there is an important
dierence in the present case in that there are no bps states with the given charges and
higgs vevs for the non-bps dyons to decay to.
