(05) equation yields b = b(y). separate coordinate transformations y, come ansatz n = f (y), = g( )f (y), b = b0, (12) b0 constant. subtracting (ii) equation (00) equation, obtain ( g/g) = 0. dene ( g/g) h0 = constant.

(14) boundary condition (7) imposes 4 k1 = k coth(c0), k2 = k coth( 1 2 kb0 + c0).

(16) (17) arrive static limit taking h0 0 c0 keeping ratio h0 2k ec0 1 xed, metric (17) becomes (10). h0 6= 0, h0 physical quantity set k corresponds shift initial value . coordinate transformation dy = dy/ sinh(kb0|y| + c0), metric becomes  ds2 = 2 + e2k ijdxidxj + b2 0dy2 sinh2(kb0|y| + c0) . (18) metric (17) describes ination spatial dimensions length extra dimension xed. given y, perform 4-dimensional coordinate transformation make 4-dimensional metric form ds2 (4) = dt2 + e2h(y)tijdxidxj. get hubble parameter especially, boundary, h(y) = k csch(kb0|y| + c0). h(0) = qk2 1 k2, h( 1 2 ) = qk2 2 k2, (19) (20) respectively. see ination occurs bulk brane cosmological constants deviate relation (9), easily seen boundary equation (8). condition (16) means keep length extra dimension xed spatial dimensions inate, must ne tune bulk brane cosmological constants, words, must put two branes distance l5 apart given k1, k2 k. general case distance two branes larger smaller l5, solution obtained non-separable function n(, y) = a(, y) = 1 f (y) + g0 , b(, y) = kb0 a(, y), b0 g0 constants. metric general case found ds2 = 2 + ijdxidxj + (kb0 )2dy2 2 , 5 (21) (22) b0 c0 given c0 = cosh1 k1 k ! , kb0 = 2"cosh1 k2 k ! cosh1 k1 k !# .

(26) 2) small, keep 1 since h( 1 2kbrs order 1, also adjust bulk hidden brane cosmological constants accuracy bulk visible brane cosmological constants. rs solution gauge hierarchy problem demands 1 2kbrs 37, number seems quite moderate rst sight. however, fact, requires ne tune hidden brane hubble parameter visible one: h(0) = qk2 1 k2 1016h( 1 2 ) < 1076mp. (27) thus, solve gauge hierarchy problem context rs model, balance bulk hidden brane cosmological constants take place 1016 times accuracy bulk visible cosmological constants. rate, rs model converts gauge hierarchy ne tuning bulk brane cosmological constants. interesting look problem terms four dimensional eective theory see whether nice stabilization mechanism argument avoided using additional interactions b modulus gravity. summary, found general inationary solutions slab 5-dimensional ads spacetime two boundary 3-branes viewed rs model static limit solutions. cosmological constant problem gauge hierarchy problem recast ne tuning problem bulk brane cosmological constants. cosmological constant problem appear ne tuning bulk visible brane cosmological constants, gauge hierarchy problem severe ne tuning bulk hidden brane cosmological constants. inclusion matter brane boundaries might alter conclusion, expect much. real solution problems surely requires additional ingredients 5-dimensional model considered paper, implications simple model interesting deserves study. magic bullet cosmological constant problem gauge hierarchy problem may found correlation mechanism bulk brane cosmological constants, reminds us recent development string theory, holography. also leave modulus stabilization problem connected problem addressed letter future work. 7 acknowledgments would like thank jai-chan hwang, youngjai kiem, yoonbai kim useful discus- sions especially kiwoon choi valuable comments. 8
