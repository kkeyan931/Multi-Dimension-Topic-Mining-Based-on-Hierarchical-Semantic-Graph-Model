perturbative quantum gauge eld theory seen within the perspective of physical gauge choices
such as the light-cone entails the emergence of troublesome poles of the type (k  n) in the
feynman integrals, and these come from the boson eld propagator, where  = 1, 2,    and n is
the external arbitrary four-vector that denes the gauge proper. this becomes an additional hurdle
to overcome in the computation of feynman diagrams, since any graph containing internal boson
lines will inevitably produce integrands with denominators bearing the characteristic gauge-xing
factor. how one deals with them has been the subject of research for over decades, and several
prescriptions have been suggested and tried in the course of time, with failures and successes.

however, a more recent development in this front which applies the negative dimensional technique
to compute light-cone feynman integrals shows that we can altogether dispense with prescriptions
to perform the calculations. an additional bonus comes attached to this new technique in that not
only it renders the light-cone prescriptionless, but by the very nature of it, can also dispense with
decomposition formulas or partial fractioning tricks used in the standard approach to separate pole
products of the type (k  n)[(k  p)  n], ( = 1, 2,   ).

in this work we demonstrate how all this can be done.

i. introduction.

light-cone gauge for gauge eld theories is probably one of the most widely used among the algebraic non-covariant
gauges. its popularity has known ups and downs along its history. among the ups are that the emerging propagator
has a deceivingly simple structure compared to other non-covariant choices, the decoupling of fadeev-popov ghosts
from the physical elds, and the possibility of describing and modeling complex supersymmetric string theories in it.
the ugly side of the coin is represented by the subtle (k  n) singularities present in all the physical amplitudes
described within it. such complication demanded ad hoc prescriptions to handle the singularity in a mathematically
consistent way. apart from the fact that such expedient has to be carried out by hand, it was soon realized that it was
not enough to be mathematically well-dened, it had to be physically consistent as well. thus, not any prescription
is suitable, but only causal prescriptions are eligible for the light-cone gauge.

probably the major breakthrough in recent years along this line is the realization that d-dimensional feynman
integrals can be analytically continued to negative dimensions and performed there and then brought back to positive
dimensionality [1,2]. negative dimensional integration method (ndim) is tantamount to the performing of fermionic
integration in positive dimensions [3]. this, can be applied to light-cone integrals with surprising eects. no pre-
scription is called for the computation [4] and moreover, as it can be shortly seen, it can dispense altogether with the
necessity of partial fractioning products of gauge-dependent poles [5], a condition sine qua non when one resorts to
the use of prescriptions.

in this work we shall demonstrate the two surprising features of ndim when employed in the light-cone context:
no prescriptions and no partial fractionings are needed. our lab-testing is performed taking the simplest scalar and
tensorial structures for one-loop integrals.

ii. one-loop light-cone gauge loop integrals.

first of all, let us make things more concrete, by analysing the framework of vector gauge elds, e.g. the pure

yang-mills elds, where, after taking the limit of vanishing gauge parameter, the propagator reads:

(k) =

k2 + i (cid:20)g 

nk + nk

(cid:21)

(1)

where here (a, b) are the gauge group indices, n is the arbritary and constant light-like four-vector which denes the
gauge, naa(x) = 0 ; n2 = 0. this propagator generates d-dimensional feynman integrals of the following generic
form:

ilc = z

ddki

a(kj , pl)

f (kj n, pl n)
h(kj n, pln)

,

(2)

where pl labels all the external momenta, and n
 is a null four-vector, dual to n. a conspicuous feature that we need
to note rst of all, is that the dual vector n
, when it appears at all, it does so always and only in the numerators
of the integrands. and herein comes the rst seemingly misterious facet of light-cone gauge. how come that from
a propagator expression like (1), which contains no n factors, can arise integrals of the form (2), with prominently
seen n factors? again, this is most easily seen in the framework of denite external vectors n and n. an alternative
way of writing the generic form of a light-cone integral is

i 1n
lc

= z

ddki

a(kj , pl)

g(kj
j , pl
l )
h(kj n, pl n)

,

(3)

j , pl

where the numerator g(kj
l ) denes a tensorial structure in the integral. for a vector, we have k = (k+, k, kt),
where k+ = 21/2(k0+kd1) and k = 21/2(k0kd1). if we choose denite n and n such that n = (1, 0,    , 1),
and n
   , 1), this allows us to write k+  k  n and k  k  n. we have therefore traced back the
origin for the numerator factors containing n. we would like to emphasize here that the presence of this n in the
numerators of integrands has nothing whatsoever to do with some kind of prescription input. it is rather an intrinsic
feature of the general structure of a feynman integral in the light-cone gauge.

 = (1, 0,

of course, for practical reasons we illustrate the ndim methodology picking up only few of the scalar, vector and

second-rank tensor one-loop integrals. so, we shall be considering the following:

t1(i, j, l) = z ddq n(q) ,

1 (i, j, l) = z ddq q n(q) ,
t 

1 (i, j, l) = z ddq qq n(q) ,
t 

n(q)  [(q  p)2i](q n)j (q n)l.

t2(i, j, l, m) = z ddq r(q) ,

2 (i, j, l, m) = z ddq q r(q) ,
t 

2 (i, j, l, m) = z ddq qq r(q) ,
t 

r(q)  [(q  p)2i](q n)j [(q  p)n]l(q n)m.

in the rst three type t1 integrals, after they are computed in ndim, only the exponents (i, j) will be analytically
continued to allow for negative values, since the original structure of the feynman integral demands exponent l  0.
similarly, for the last three type t2 integrals only the exponents (i, j, l) will be analytically continued to negative
values whereas m  0. we strongly emphasize this point in view of the fact that we must respect the very nature of
the original structure for the light-cone integrals, where factors of the form (qn) never appears in denominators.

observe that we are not invoking any kind of prescription for the (q n)j factors to solve the integrals in ndim,
since before analytic continuation j is strictly positive and there are no poles to circumvent! this is the beauty and
strength of ndim! neither are the (qn)l numerator factors due to some sort of prescription input as they are, e.g.,
in the mandelstam-leibbrandt (ml) treatment, where one makes the substitution [611]

m = z

ddq

(q  p)2(qn)

ml z

ddq (qn)

(q  p)2 [(qn)(qn) + i]

.

(10)

let us then evaluate the integrals using the ndim approach. in fact, our rst integral t1 has already been calculated

with great details in our previous paper [4] whose result is,

t ac

1

(i, j, l) = i+ (pn)j (pn)l (i|2i + )(j|  i  )

(1 + l|i + )

,

(11)

where

 

2 pn pn

nn

,

and the superscript ac means that the exponents (i, j) were analytically continued to allow for negative values,
 = d/2 and we use the pochhammer symbol,

(a|b)  (a)b =

(a + b)

(a)

.

(12)

observe that l must take only positive values or zero since the pochhammer symbol containing (1 + l) was not

analytically continued.

consider now the second integral, vectorial, given in (5). for this case, let,

g = z ddq q exp(cid:2)(q  p)2  (qn)  (qn)(cid:3).

introducing the standard trick of substituting the q factor for a derivative in p [12], we obtain,

g = (cid:16) 

(cid:17) ep2

exp(cid:20)p2 +
n(cid:19) g0,

n

= (cid:18)p 


2

(nn)  p+  p(cid:21)

where p+ = pn and p = pn, as usual in the light-cone notation [6,7], and dene

g0  (cid:16) 
(cid:17)

exp(cid:20) 

2

(nn)  p+  p(cid:21).

now, taylor expanding the exponential in equation (13),

g =



xi,j,l=0

(1)i+j+lijl

i!j!l!

t 
1 (i, j, l),

and following the steps for ndim calculation [1] we get nally,

where

(18)

this result is in euclidean space and valid for positive dimension (d = 2 > 0), negative exponents (i, j) and l  0.
the second-rank tensor integral in (6) can be evaluated in a similar way. the only thing that need to be taken into
account is that now a second derivative is called for and the calculation becomes lengthier. we only quote the nal
result:

(2 + i + j + )(1 + i + j + )(nn)2(cid:21) nn.

(i + )(1 + i + )(p)2

(i + )(1 + i + )(p+)2

(20)

it can be noted that for the particular case of i = j = 1 the pole piece for   2 only arises in the scalar integral

factor t ac

1

(i, j, l), equation (11).

now, let us consider the integrals {t2}. these contain two scalar products with n, but again they are harmless in
ndim approach because their exponents, before analytic continuation, are positive. however, in the usual positive
dimensional approach, such factors can become singular and prescriptions become a necessity. yet prescriptions cannot
handle products; one needs to use partial fractioning rst. thus, the recourse is to use the so-called decomposition
formulas such as (see, for example, [6,13])

(kn)(p  k)n

=

1

pn (cid:20)

1

(p  k)n

+

1

kn(cid:21) , pn 6= 0 ,

(21)

ndim does not require any of such partial fractionings; it can handle products at the same time. not only that,
ndim can handle any power of these products simultaneously, i.e., factors of the form (k  n)[(p  k)  n], with
(,  = 2, 3,   ) which, of course, becomes the more strenuously dicult to handle by partial fractioning the higher
the power we have.

to evaluate t2 using ndim, let us then consider the gaussian-like integral,

which yields

g2 = z ddq exp(cid:2)(q  p)2  qn  (q  p)n  qn(cid:3),

g2 = (cid:16) 

(cid:17)d/2

exp(cid:18)p+  p +


2

nn +


2

nn(cid:19) .

on the other hand, direct taylor expansion of (22) yields

g2 =



xi,j,l,m=0

(1)i+j+l+m ijlm
i!j!l!m!

t2(i, j, l, m).

(22)

(23)

(24)

comparing both expressions and solving for t2(i, j, l, m) we get a unique solution for a system of 4  4 linear
algebraic equations [2], which analytically continued to positive dimension and negative values for (i, j, l) nally gives

t ac

(i, j, l, m) =  i+ (p+)j+l(p)m (i|2i + l + )(j|  i  l  )

(1 + m|i + )

.

(25)

again, superscript ac means (i, j, l) strictly negative and m  0.
with help of equation (23) it is easy to solve the two remaining integrals, whose nal results we quote here:

t , ac

(i, j, l, m) = v

(i, j, l, m) ,

(2 + i + m + )(1 + i + m + )(nn)2(cid:21) nn
(2 + i + j + l + )(1 + i + j + l + )(nn)2(cid:21) nn .

(i + l + )(1 + i + l + )(p+)2

(i + )(1 + i + )(p)2

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

finally, before closing this section, let us analyse (7) with momentum shift q = p  k, so that

t2(i, j, l, m) = (1)j+l+m 2(i, j, l, m) ,

or

2(i, j, l, m) = (1)jlm t2(i, j, l, m) ,

(30)

where

2(i, j, l, m) = z ddk k2i[(k  p)n]j(kn)l[(k  p)n]m.

then, we can easily write down the following results

2 = p 2  (1)jlm t 
 
2 ,

and

 
2 = pp 2 + p  

2 + p  

2 + (1)jlm t 

2

.

(31)

(32)

(33)

particular cases for t1, t2 and 2 such as t1(1, 1, 0), t2(1, 1, 1, 0), etc., can be worked out from the general

expressions. all the above results are in agreement with the ones tabulated in [6,7,14].

iii. discussion and conclusion.

ndim is a technique wherein the principle of analytic continuation plays a key role. we solve a feynman-like
integral, i.e., a negative dimensional loop integral with propagators raised to positive powers in the numerator and
then analytically continue the result to allow for negative values of those exponents and positive dimension.

5

in positive dimensions, feynman integrals for covariant gauge choices can be worked out with a variety of methods.
however, when we work in the light-cone gauge things become more complicated in virtue of the presence of unwieldy
gauge dependent singularities. and herein comes the help of ndim with surprising eect: propagators raised to
positive powers in the feynman-like integrals does not have poles of any kind to trouble us. therefore no prescription
is needed in the ndim approach, and moreover, no partial fractioning is necessary. the beauty and the strength of
ndim to deal with light-cone integrals is revealed and demonstrated in a marvelous way.

so, we can summarize all this by enumerating the outstanding features of ndim: i) no prescription at all is required
to deal with gauge dependent poles of the usual feynman integrals; ii) the overall structure of the feynman integrals
in the light-cone gauge is preserved, i.e., there is no need to introduce factors of the form q n in denominators as
prescription input; iii) there is no need to use parametrization of any kind, so that there are no parametric integrals
to solve; iv) there is no need to perform integration with split components such as in [13], where the integration in
space-time is performed by decomposing d2q  d21q dq4; v) there is no need to resort to partial fractionings such
as (21); vi) the nal result comes out for arbitrary negative exponents of propagators, so that special cases of interest
are all contained therein; vii) the nal result is already within the dimensional regularization context.

in this work we calculated integrals  scalar, vector, and second-rank tensor  pertaining to light-cone gauge with
arbitrary exponents of propagators and dimension. our results given in (11), (17), (19), (25), (26), (28), (30), (32),
and (33) can be worked out for particular values for the exponents and compared to those existing in the literature
and checked that they are all in agreement.

but, with no doubt, the most outstanding conclusion that we can draw from this exercise is that no prescription
was required to tackle the light-cone singularities. of course, it is a matter of straightforward generalization that all
other non-covariant gauge choices will follow suit.
