(this obtained either entropy considerations {$9604089$}{$9708005$} calculating conformal anomaly partition function{$9812032$}). follows non-abelian system cannot conventional gauge theory description since n 3 dim gl(n ). conformal anomaly observables associated closed two-dimensional submanifolds also calculated {$9901021$} large n limit. contrast, world-volume theory single -theory vebrane well understood consists free (2, 0) tensor multiplet, i.e. two-form gauge eld self-dual eld strength, scalars, eight spinors. self-duality constraint two-form, covariant action eld, theory still dened manner similar chiral bosons two dimensions treated . chiral bosons, course know write interacting theory, namely wess-zumino-witten model. one possible avenue towards understanding interacting (2, 0) theory might make similar generalization chiral 2-form theory. letter, consider theory free non-chiral two-form b six dimensional manifold coordinates x , = 1, . . . , 6. classical action s0 = 1 12 z d6xgh h ggg , (1) h = 3d = b + b + b covariant derivative compatible background metric g . eld strength h , thus action, invariant gauge transformations acting b b + b , b dx dx closed two-form integer periods. given closed two-dimensional embedded submanifold coordinates , = 1, 2, construct gauge-invariant wilson surface observable w () = exp 2iz dx x b. (2) gauge invariance, need introduce ghost c, antighost b, ghost-for-ghost . latter necessary since gauge algebra reducible. precise form ghost action easily obtained using antield formalism. however, since theory free ghosts decouple precise form ghost action necessary. gauge x use covariant gauge xing condition, db = 0 add gauge xing term action becomes = z d6xg (3) parameter . change aect correlation functions gauge invariant observables, henceforth take = 1. 2 classical action (1) observable (2) invariant conformal transformations acting g = 2g b = 0, (4) arbitrary innitesimal parameter function. invariance broken gauge-xing term, expectation values wilson surface observables still formally invariant. indeed, hw ()i = exp(cid:0)42i(cid:1), = z dx ()x ()z ; (x(), x()). x () x () (5) ; (x, x ) = hb(x)b (x )i propagator b -eld. since conformal invari- ance action broken gauge xing term, conformal variation propagator must given exact term, i.e. ; (x, x ) = ; (x, x ) + (x, x ) (6) ; ; , prime derivative indicates derivative respect x variable. since integral exact form closed manifold vanishes, would seem conformally invariant. however, quantum theory divergences arise regularized canceled. done covariant way, conformal invariance generally lost. objective letter carry procedure compute conformal anomaly theory. next section, outline regularization procedure, section 3, discuss form possible conformal anomalies, last section, present detailed computation anomaly. 2 regularization procedure integrand (5) divergences along diagonal . regularize covariant manner, exclude integration region points geodesic distance diagonal less cut-o distance , i.e. consider regulated quantity = z dx () x ()z x () x () (cid:0)s2(x(), x()) 2(cid:1) ; (x(), x()), (7) s2(x, x ) square geodesic distance (t) step function. general grounds, expect = 2i2 + log i0 + inite + o(), (8) i2 i0 given local expressions integrated . divergences thus canceled local counterterms left inite, however conformally invariant general. indeed, conformal transformation = 2a2 + a0 + o(), 3 (9) anomaly a0 equals conformal variation inite.
