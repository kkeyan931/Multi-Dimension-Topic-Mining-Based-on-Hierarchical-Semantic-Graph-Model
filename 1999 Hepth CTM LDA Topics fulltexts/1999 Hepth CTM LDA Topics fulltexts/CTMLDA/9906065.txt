(32) conjugation property (31) suggests following formal denition hermitian conjugate octonionic basis: whereupon number operators become equal identity element: e 0 = e0 , e j = ej (j = 1, 2, , 7) , n := e e = ee = e0 = 1 , (no summation) ( = 0, 1, , 7) . dene hermitian conjugate complex octonions z natural way, z := 7x=0 ze = z0e0 7xi=1 ziei z0 z , zi lc . calculate zz (z0 + z)(z0 z) = |z0|2 + (z0z z0z) zz = 7x=0 |z|2 = n (z) + 2i (z0 zk zk z0)ek + 7xk=1 7xk=1z0zk + x1i<j7 7x1i<j zi zjk ij ek , (zi zj zj zi)eiej 5 (33) (34) (35) (36) n (z) = 7x=0 |z|2 .

(39) hence, z mapped z, z mapped z , obtained standard hermitian conjugation matrix z. one main insights gained using matrix representation calculate hermitian norm. z z = z = b ! , product z z = b ! . z z = b ! b ! b + 2 tr aa 2  + 1 = b + + 2  + 1 2 tr bb ! . (40) (41) zero component zz proportional trace z z , new hermitian norm expressed terms representation matrices z follows: n (z) = = 1 4 1 tr (z z ) = 2 ||2 + ||2 + 1 1 2(cid:16)||2 + ||2(cid:17) + (|ak|2 + |bk|2)! = 3xk=1 7x=0 |z|2 , 4(cid:16)tr (aa) + tr (bb)(cid:17) (42) accordance (37). real z get , b (26). therefore, ab aa = = a. thus, formally dened scalar reduces conventional norm: n (z) = b = ||2 + ||2 + 3xk=1|ak|2 = 7x=0 x2 n(z) 0 .
