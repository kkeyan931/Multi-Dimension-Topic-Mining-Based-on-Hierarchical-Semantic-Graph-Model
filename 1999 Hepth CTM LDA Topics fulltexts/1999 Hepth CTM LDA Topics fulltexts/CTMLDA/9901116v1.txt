abstract

the covariant operator quantization of the ordinary free spinning bdh string
modied by adding the supersymmetric liouville sector is analysed in the even
target space dimensions d = 2, 4, 6, 8. the spectrum generating algebra for this
model is constructed and a general version of the no-ghost theorem is proven. a
counterpart of the gso projection leads to a family of tachyon free unitary free
string theories. one of these models is equivalent to the non-critical rammond-
neveu-schwarz spinning string truncated in the neveu-schwarz sector to the tachyon
free eigenspace of the fermion parity operator.

1 introduction

the relevance of the (super-)liouville theory for a proper description of quantum string in
non-critical dimensions was rst pointed out in polyakovs celebrated papers on conformal
anomaly in bosonic [1] and fermionc [2] string models. this observation inspired extensive
studies of the quantum liouville [3] and the super-liouville theory [4]. in spite of signif-
icant progress in d  1 non-critical strings [5] and superstrings [6] and the subsequent
development of the corresponding liouville [7] and the super-liouville [8] conformal eld
theories the question whether the famous d = 1 barrier can be overcome remains open.
there are basically two dierent approaches to this problem. one of them developed by
gervais and collaborators [9] has already brought many promising results but technicalities
involved make it dicult to go beyond topological models [10]. the second approach
recently advocated by polyakov [11] identies the liouville degree of freedom with an
extra fth curved dimension. this idea received unexpected support from the recently
discovered relation between the fundamental iib superstring in ads5  s5 background
and the supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four dimensions [12]. it is believed that this
approach may lead to a plausible scenario for non-critical strings but there are still many
dicult open problems [13].

whatever an ultimate understanding of the liouville dynamics would be it seems
reasonable to analyse less ambitious and more elementary questions about the role of the
liouville degrees of freedom in the quantum mechanics of free strings. the rst attempt
in this direction was made long time ago by marnelius [14]. he considered the standard
string model modied by adding the liouville sector. assuming some general features of
the quantum liouville dynamics he was able to show [15] that the non-zero liouville modes
can be identied with the longitudinal brower excitations of the non-critical nambu-goto
string [16].

this modication of bosonic string has been recently reconsidered under the assump-
tion that the bulk and boundary cosmological constants vanish [17]. this apparently
drastic simplication leads however to a nontrivial free string model exhibiting many in-
teresting features [17]. in particular the constraint eliminating the liouville zero mode
appears as a consistency condition for the variational principle. this excludes for instance
the interpretation of the liouville sector in terms of an extra target space dimension.

in the covariant quantization the liouville sector is described by a free 2-dimensional
conformal eld theory of the fegin-fuchs type [18]. the corresponding no-ghost theorem
[17] admits a family of new non-critical free bosonic quantum strings called massive strings
for the properties of their spectra - all states except the tachyonic ground state are massive.
one of them with the largest possible space of null states is called the critical massive
string3. it is completely equivalent to the non-critical nambu-goto string [16]. in this
special case one can also develop the light-cone formulation and calculate the particle
content of the model [19].

the problem addressed in the present paper is the covariant operator quantization of
the fermionic counterpart of open massive string and the general no-ghost theorem for
this model. the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 the classical model of massive
string is introduced. in section 3 we present the covariant quantization of the model. in
section 4 the space of physical states is explicitly constructed in terms of ddf operators.

3the model is critical with respect to the structure of null states rather than the dimension d of the

target space which may vary in the range 1 < d < 25.

1

this is our main result. it is used in section 5 to prove a general version of the no-ghost
theorem. in section 6 we introduce a non-critical counterpart of the gso projection and
construct a family of tachyon free unitary fermionic string models.

2 classical theory

one can introduce the fermionic massive string as a world-sheet n = 1 supersymmetric
extension of the bosonic model.
it is dened by the spinning string covariant action
[20] supplemented by the supersymmetric liouville action [21, 22, 23] with vanishing
cosmological terms. in the superspace notation [24] it takes the form:

2zm
s[e, , x] =  
2zm
 

d2z d2edxdx 

(1)

d2z d2e (dd  2ise)

.

where

x (x, ) = x(x) + i + i

2 d

, (x, ) = (x) + il + i

2 dl ,

are the embedding and the liouville 2-dim real scalar superelds, respectively. for the
2-dim supergravity sector we use howes notations and conventions [24] (ea
m denotes the
supervierbein and se is the corresponding curvature scalar supereld). in all three sectors
we assume unique supersymmetric extensions [25, 21] of the boundary conditions of the
bosonic massive string [17].

the action is invariant under superdieomorphisms and local lorentz transformations.
due to the absence of cosmological terms it is also invariant with respect to a special class
of superconformal transformations

with scaling superelds  satisfying the equation dd = 0. due to this extra symmetry
the supergravity sector can be completely gauged away. in the at superconformal gauge

.

in the neveu-schwarz sector ( = 1)

h1(p, pl) = f1(p, pl)

.

in the rammond sector ( = 0) the fermionic zero modes b
0 , d0 form the real cliord
algebra c(d, 1) corresponding to the metric of (d, 1) signature.
if one requires a well
dened fermion parity operator the zero mode sector of h0(p, pl) must carry an irreducible
representation of the real cliord algebra c(d + 1, 1).
for the sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves to the even dimensions d = 2, 4, 6, 8 of
the target space. as we shall see in sect.5. higher dimensions are excluded by the no-
ghost theorem. let d(d + 2) be the space of an irreducible representation of the complex
extension cc(d + 2) = c(d + 1, 1)  ci of the real cliord algebra c(d + 1, 1). note that
for even d the algebra cc(d + 2) is simple and there is only one such representation of
complex dimension 2
2 . d(d + 2) regarded as a representation of c(d + 1, 1) is irreducible
only for d = 4 [26]. for d = 2, 6, 8 the complex representation d(d + 2) decomposes into
a direct sum of two equivalent real irreducible representations of c(d + 1, 1)

d+2

d(d + 2) = s(d + 1, 1)  s(d + 1, 1)

,

where s(d + 1, 1) are characterised by appropriate majorana conditions [26].

4

strictly speaking the rules of covariant quantization require an irreducible represen-
tation of the real cliord algebra c(d + 1, 1). we shall however admit the complex
representation d(d + 2) which leads to the following structure of h0(p, pl)

h0(p, pl) = f0(p, pl)  d(d + 2)

,

and provides a unied formulation for all cases d = 2, 4, 6, 8. other reasons for this choice
will be discussed in sect.5.

n, cn, b

let us denote by a

r , dr the operators on f0(p, pl) representing non-zero bosonic
and fermionic modes. using gamma matrices of the d(d+2) representation normalised by
(0)2 = (1)2 = . . . = (d1)2 = (l)2 = (f )2 = 1, one can construct a representation
of the algebra (5) on h0(p, pl) as follows

cn = cn  1
dr = dr  f
d0 = 1  12l
the fermion parity operator on h0(p, pl) can be dened by

determined by the relations (5) and the conjugation properties (6).

dr dr is the fermion number operator on f0(p, pl).

the constraint operators lm, gr on h are represented by normally ordered coun-
terparts of the classical expressions (2). for the bosonic and fermionic zero modes we
assume the symmentric and the antisymmetric ordering, respectively. in both sectors the
quantum constraints algebra takes the form

4 ddf construction

the ddf construction [27] for the neveu-schwarz model was developed long time ago
by schwarz [28], and by brower and friedman [29]. in this section we shall extend this
technique to the fermionic massive string. for this purpose it is convenient to introduce
the subspace h  h of on-shell states  satisfying the on-mass-shell conditions4
(cid:17)  = 0 , p l = pl

2 (p l)2 + r + m2

(8)

where

(l0  a) =(cid:16) 1
r = xm>0

(amam + cmcm) +xr>0

r (brbr + drdr)

,

is the level operator. since l0 commutes with the poincare generators h carries a
representation of the poincare algebra. the decomposition of h with respect to the
mass coincides with the level structure

h = mn0hn



; r hn

 = nhn



.

(9)

each subspace hn

is a direct integral of nite dimensional subspaces hn

 (p) with xed

 denotes the mass shell at level n determined by the condition (8), and dn (p)

let us x a light-cone frame {e, e1, . . . , ed2} in d-dimensional minkowski space nor-
= 0, e+  e = 1, and ei  ej = ij for i, j = 1, . . . , d  2. we shall use the

malised by e2

following notation for the light-cone components of a vector v

v = e  v , v i = ei  v .

in the original construction the domain of ddf operators is restricted to states with
momenta satisfying 1 p+  zz. this restriction can be overcome introducing slightly
modied ddf elds

x() = (cid:16)
p() = (cid:16)
() = (cid:16)

p+(cid:17)1 fx()
p+(cid:17)1 ep()
p+(cid:17)1 e()

, x i() = fx i()
, p i() = ep i()
, i() = ei()

,

,

.

4the on-mass-shell conditions are not essential for the construction of ddf operators. we impose

them at the beginning in order to simplify our presentation.

6

the rescaling above leaves unchanged all the (anti)commutation relations relevant for
calculating the algebra of ddf operators. let us note that a single light-cone frame is
sucient for a global ddf parameterisation of h. indeed the momenta with p+ = 0 for
which the construction gets singular form a zero measure subset of each mass shell sn

and can be neglected.

the ddf operators for the super-matter sector are exactly the same as in the

neveu-schwarz model [28, 29]. in our notation they read

(15)

where f tr,f l denote fock spaces generated by the algebra of the transverse and the super-
liouville ddf operators (11), and v(c, h) is the superconformal verma module generated
by the rammond-neveu-schwarz superconformal algebra of the shifted longitudinal
ddf operators with the central charge c = 9  d  32 (13). the highest weight h of

the fock space component f tr  f l of h(p)ph (15) is the same in both sectors and
carries a positive denite metric. the metric structure of the superconformal verma
module v(c, h) had been extensively studied in the context of unitary highest weight
representations of the rammond-neveu-schwarz superconformal algebra. the necessary
conditions for the absence of negative norm states in v(c, h) were derived by friedan,
qiu, and shenker [30, 31]. it was farther proven by goddard, kent, and olive [32] that
these conditions are also sucient.

let us assume that the necessary and sucient conditions for the non-negative metric
structure of the superconformal verma module of the rammond superalgebra [30, 31, 32]
are satised. then the properties of the metric structure of hph
0 are entirely determined
by the properties of the metric structures of the subspaces of physical vacuua h0
0(p)ph let us rst analyse
in order to nd an explicit form of the scalar product in h0
hermitian scalar products on the irreducible representations d(d + 2) of the complex
cliord algebras cc(d + 2). there exists one and only one hermitian positive denite
scalar product ( , ) on d(d + 2) such that all gamma matrices are isometries. we dene

for any two solutions (x), (x) the vector current

(18)

h, i = z dx1 . . . dxd1 ((x), (x))
= z dxdd2x ((x), +0(x))

proceeding to the momentum representation and taking into account the lorentz invariant
measure in (16) one gets the scalar product in h0

0(p)ph

h(p), (p)il.c. = ((p), +0(p))

.

since it is neutral so is the metric structure of h0(p)ph, and in consequence the metric
structure of the space hph
0 of all physical states. this is not necessarily a disaster for the
unitarity of the model. what saves the day is a lorentz invariant decomposition of hph
0
into a direct sum of two orthogonal components

hph
0 = hph

0 +  hph
0 

(19)

with a positive and a negative denite scalar products, respectively. in order to con-
struct such decomposition let us consider the extension 0 =   1 of  from d(d + 2)

11

to the whole pseudo-hilbert space h0 of covariant quantization. using the explicit re-
alisation (7) one can easily verify that 0 has all the properties of the fermion parity
operator. this in particular implies that 0 commutes with the lorentz generators, and
anticommutes with the dirac operator (17). then it follows from the representation (18)
that the eigenspaces hph
0  corresponding to 1 eigenvalues of 0 yield the decomposition
required.
the unitarity problem can be solved by imposing the superselection rule related to
the decomposition (19). this is possible if and only if an operator 0 with the required
properties can be constructed which is always the case if we start with the complex
representation d(d + 2). note that for d < 9 and within the covariant quantization based
on the irreducible representations s(d+1, 1) of the cliord algebra c(d+1, 1) the operator
0 exists only for d = 4 and d = 8 [26]. this provides another justication for our choice
made in sect.3.

taking into account the restrictions for possible central charges, and highest weights
of the superconformal verma module v0(c, h0) of the rammond superconformal algebra
one gets the following

in all our considerations the zero mode of the liouville momentum pl has been re-
garded as a free parameter of the quantum theory. the no-ghost theorems do not impose
any restriction on pl. since there is no ordering ambiguity in the constraint p l = 0 we
shall assume pl = 0. in this case the parameters m0, m1 have the interpretation of the
physical masses of the corresponding ground states.

6 conclusions

the results of the previous section yield a complete classication of all admissible hilbert
spaces hph
 (, m) of both sectors of the massive fermionic string in terms of the param-
eters , and m. for  from the discrete series the total hilbert space is given by

hph(m) = mpq oddhph

0 (m, mp,q) mpq even hph

1 (m, mp,q)

,

12

where the sum runs over all 1  p < m, 1  q < m + 2, and m = 2, 3, . . . . the central
charge c of the superconformal algebra of the shifted longitudinal ddf operators

c = cm = 1 

8

m(m + 2)

,

measures the number of longitudinal physical degrees of freedom.
in particular for
m = 2, one gets c2 = 0, and all states containing longitudinal excitations are null.
the quantum theory contains one superfunctional physical degree of freedom less than
the classical one. for large m the central charge cm approaches 1. the limiting case
c = c = 1 corresponds to  = 1
32 (8  d)  the upper bound of the continuous series. we
dene
hph() = hph

in this model the space of physical states is largest possible. both the classical, and the
quantum theories contain d superfunctional physical degrees of freedom.

m=2

for  in the range 0 <  < 1

32 (8  d), one has 1 < c, and the structure of the
physical degrees of freedom of the quantum theory is essentially the same as in the model
described by hph(). one could in principle dene a continuous family of models but
without any extra physical assumption the ground state masses m0, m1 are undetermined
free parameters of such construction.
models from the family nhph(m)o

are not quite satisfactory. the spectrum of
each neveu-schwarz sector contains tachyon, while the metric in the rammond sector
is always neutral. as we have seen in the previous section the second problem can be
overcome by introducing superselection rule related to the operator 0. one can try to
extend this rule to the whole hilbert space. following the scheme of the gso projection
in the critical string [33] we decompose the space hph
1 (m) of the neveu-schwarz sector
into the direct sum
1 +(m)  hph
of the 1 eigenspaces of the fermion parity operator 1

hph
1 (m) = hph

1 = (1)f +1

, f =xr>0
with this denition of 1 the eigenspace hph
1 +(m) corresponding to +1 eigenvalue does
not contain the tachyonic ground state. we introduce a non-critical counterpart of the
gso projection as the projection on the +1 eigenspace

of the fermion parity operator  = 0  1. it yields a family of tachyon free unitary
in contrast the original gso projection [33] it does not
non-critical fermionic strings.
lead to a supersymmetric spectrum. note that there are no massles states in models with
odd m.

the model corresponding to beginning of the discrete series  = 2 = 9d

32 is especially
interesting. in this case the subspace of null physical states is largest possible. for this
reason it will be called the critical (fermionic) massive string. the space of true physical
states htr(2) is given by the quotient

htr(2) = hph(2)
{null states}

as in the case of the bosonic critical massive string [19] one can show that the subspace
hrns = hrns
1  hph(2) generated by the transverse ai, bi, and the longitudinal
a, b, ddf operators is a good gauge slice for the quotient map hph(2)  htr(2). in
consequence the even (with respect to ) subspace hrns
1 + yields a 1-1
parameterisation of the quotient space htr
the superalgebra of the transverse and the longitudinal ddf operators of the critical
massive string is by construction isomorphic with the whole ddf algebra of the non-
critical rammond-neveu-schwarz string [28, 29]. this implies that in the neveu-schwarz
sector the subspace hrns
is isomorphic with the tachyon free eigenspace of the fermion
parity operator in the space of physical states of the non-critical rns string.
in the
rammond sector each eigenspace hrns
of 0 carries the same complex representation
0 
d(d) of the real cliord algebra c(d  1, 1), and is therefore isomorphic with the whole
space of physical states in the rammond sector of the non-critical rns string.
is stable with respect to the poincare
transformations, and carries a representation which is isomorphic with the representation
of the poincare group in the non-critical rns string. it follows that the gso projected
fermionic critical massive string is equivalent with the non-critical rns string truncated
in the neveu-schwarz sector to the tachyon free eigenspace of the fermion parity operator.
we have shown that the covariant quantization of the free fermionic massive string in
the even dimensions d = 2, 4, 6, 8 leads to a family of new tachyon free unitary fermionic
strings. one of these models - the critical fermionic massive string - is closely related to
the non-critical rns string.

one can easily verify that the subspace hrns

there are at least two interesting open problems before one may try to attack the
question of the interacting theory. first of all it would be desirable to develope the light-
cone formulation of the critical massive string and to calculate its spin content. in view of
the equivalence discussed above it would provide the particle spectrum of the non-critical
rns string. the second problem is to analyse the superconformal eld theory structure of
the fermionic massive string. this would in particular clarify the status of the non-critical
gso projection proposed in this paper.
