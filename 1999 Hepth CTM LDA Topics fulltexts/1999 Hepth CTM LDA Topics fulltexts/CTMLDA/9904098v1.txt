abstract

in this letter the boundary problem for massless and massive rarita-schwinger eld in the
ads/cft correspondence is considered. the considerations are along the lines of a paper by
henneaux [24] and are based on the requirement the solutions to be a stationary point for the
action functional. it is shown that this requirement, along with a denite asymptotic behavior of
the solutions, xes the boundary term that must be added to the initial rarita-schwinger action.
it is also shown that the boundary term reproduce the known two point correlation functions of
certain local operators in cft living on the boundary.

1 introduction

recently a fascinating conjecture by maldacena [1] has been proposed. according to [1] the super-
gravity theory in d+1 dimensional anti-de sitter space (ads) with a compact extra space is related
by holographic correspondence principle [2] to a certain conformal eld theory (cft) living on the
boundary of ads space. the underlying principle behind this ads/cft correspondence was elabo-
rated in explicit form by gubser, klebanov and polyakov [3] and witten [4]. according to [3] and
[4], the action for the supergravity theory on ads considered as a functional of the asymptotic values
of the elds on the boundary is interpreted as a generating functional for the correlation functions in
the conformal eld theory living on the boundary. the explicit form of this interpretation is:

z

dexp{s []} = hexp zads

ddxo0i

(1)

where 0 is the boundary data for ads theory which couples to a certain conformal operator o
on the boundary. this interpretation has already a large number of examinations by computing
various correlation functions of a local operators in cft induced by ads scalar elds [4, 6, 7, 8, 9],
spinor elds [12, 10], vector elds [4, 8, 10, 11], antisymmetric elds [16, 17, 18] and rarita-schwinger
elds [19, 20, 21]. all the examples conrmed the validity of the ads/cft correspondence principle.
the essence of these examinations is in studying of the eld behavior near the boundary of ads
space and calculation of the boundary terms which produce the corresponding correlation functions
in cft. while in the case of an action of ads theory with derivatives of order higher than one the
considerations are, more or less, transparent, in the case of dirac-like actions (dirac and rarita-
schwinger) the situation is more subtle. that is because the naive limit to the boundary lead to
vanishing of the action (it is zero on shell) which obviously spoil the correspondence principle.

recently two dierent but equivalent ways of treatment of the boundary term problem in the
case of spinor eld were proposed [25, 24]. in [25] the considerations are based on the hamiltonian
approach treating x0 as an evolution parameter. a half of the components of the boundary spinor
turn out to be cannonically conjugated to the other half and the boundary term naturally appears to
be p q.

in the paper [24] another approach is used, namely the stationary phase method. it is based on

the fact that one can expand the path integral of a given theory with action s[]:

z =z de

i

h s[]

near the stationary point given by the solutions of the classical theory. in the classical limit (h  0)
the leading order is simply:

z  exp{

sclass}

i
h

where sclass is the action functional evaluated on the classical eld congurations. the stationary
point is determined by the requirement:

s


= 0

(2)

which is nothing but the classical equations of motion with given boundary data. the main immediate
but important observation is that while the action s[] may satisfy (2) on the clasical eld congura-
tions, it is not true in general if there is a surface term b, i.e. there may be b 6= 0 and therefore
(s + b) 6= 0. such a situation appears for instance in the gauge eld theory where b gives the
conserved charges of the symmetry currents. it follows that in order the classical congurations to be
a true stationary point it is necessary a boundary term to be added ensuring the wanted requirement.
this scheme was used in [24] in order to obtain the boundary term in the case of spinor eld .

in this letter we would like to study the boundary term in the case of massless and massive rarita-
schwunger eld. in our analysis we will use the receipt described in [24] for derivation of the boundary
term in the spinor case.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 the derivation of the boundary term in case of
massless rarita-schwinger eld is given. it is shown that the result reproduce exactly the two-point
correlation functions derived in [20]. in section 3 the same analysis is performed in case of massive
rrita-schwinger eld. the result for the correlation functions is in complete agreement with that
given in [21]. in the conclusions we give some remarks and brief comments.

2 boundary term for massless rarita-schwinger eld

in this section we will consider a massles rarita-schwinger eld on adsd+1 given by the following
action [5, 20]:

we used the notations:

srs = zads

dd+1xg (cid:0)d  m(cid:1) 

 = [   ],  = [  ]
 = 

(3)

(4)

where  are the gamma matrices in ads connected to the at gamma matrices by the relation
 = e
aa. the vielbein is given below and the at gamma matrices satisfy the usual anticommutation
relations {a, b} = 2ab. we choose to work in coordinates xa = (x0, xi) = (x0, x); i = 1, . . . d dening

2

d+1-dimensional euclidean anti-de sitter space as lobachevski upper half plane x0 > 0 with a metric
of the form:

with this choice the vielbein and the corresponding non-zero components of the spin connection are
given by the expressions:

ds2 =

1
x2

0 (cid:0)dx0 + dx2(cid:1)

a = 0, . . . d

the boundary of the ads space consists in a hypersurface x0 = 0 and a single point x0 = .

in this frame the covariant derivative and the dirac operator reads o:

d =  +

1
2x0 0; d = /d = x000 + x0. 

d

where  = (i);  = (i); i = 1 . . . d.

the equation of motion for rarita schwinger eld following from the action (3):

can be rewitten in the form [20]:

d = m

x00 (cid:18) d
x0i 

d
2

2

+ 1(cid:19) 00 + ma = 0

0i + mi = a0

where a = e

a.

in order to nd the boundary contributions we are interested in studying of the behavior of the
solutions near the boundary x0 = 0. for this purpose one can use the frobenius procedure looking
for solutions of the form [24]:



subsitution of these series into the equations of motion determines the values of the parameter :

(cid:0)x0(cid:1)

xn=0

ca

n (~x)(cid:0)x0(cid:1)n

 =

d
2  m + a0

(the values of  turn out to be the same as in the spinor case [24] for a 6= 0). therefore, we are dealing
with two types of solutions:



a (x0, x) = (x0)

+

a (x0, x) = (x0)

where:

d
2

m+a0 a (x) + o(cid:16)(x0)
2 +m+a0 a (x) + o(cid:16)(x0)

0a (x) =  (x)

m+a0(cid:17)
2 +m+a0(cid:17)

(10)

(11)

(12)

it follows that 
rarita-schwinger eld can be treated analogously giving the following result:

a are eigenvectors of 1/2(i  0) with eigenvalues 1 respectively. the conjugated

a (x) = a (x) (x0)

where the elds a and a are subject to the constraints:

a0 = a;

a0 =  a

note that using the equations of motion one can nd the subleading terms recursively but since they
doesnt contribute to the boundary we will skip their explicit form.

let us consider the general solutions of the equations of motion:

a (x0, ]bx) =z ddpeip.x(cid:2)f+ (x0, p) +

a (p) + f (x0, p) 

a (p)(cid:3)

since the solutions must be regular in the bulk (up to x0 = ) the boundary spinor elds 
independent and the solutions can be expressed in terms of 

a only 2[20]:

compact support and vanish at x   and therefore can be fourier transformed.

the components of the rarita-schwinger eld are subject to one more constraint:

00 + ii = 0

which relate the 

0 and 

i components as follows [20]:

(20)

(21)

using the asymptotic expressions for a (10,11) it is easy to nd the relation between a (p) and
a (p) and 

a (p):

(23)

from (18,19, 21) it follows that 

a can be expressed in terms of +

a (p) only and that a and a

are related on-shell.

the nal lesson from the above considerations is that a half of the boundary data is expressible in
terms of the other half but the relations are valid on-shell. the main conclusion is that the general
solutions of the equations of motion in the whole ads space are determined by the elds annihilated
by (i + 0), a quite similar result as in case of spinor eld [24].

now we are going to apply the variational principle to the rarira-schwinger action (3). since
the rarira-schwinger equations of motion are rst order dierential equations we cannot x all the
components of a at the boundary but only a half of them, a or a. the basic idea is to use ads
correspondence principle which tells us that the elds a serve as a sources for the bulk-boundary
green functions [12, 19, 20]. thus, it is appropriate to x a at the boundary and to leave a to vary.
the variational principle will be applied to all congurations of the form:

a = 
a = 

a + +
a
a + +

a

(24)

a and +

the elds 
a have the asymptotic (10, 13) while a and a are xed on the boundary. the
other part of +
a behaves near the boundary as it is described in (11,14), but in this case the
values of a and a on the boundary are free to vary. the relations between a and a (22, 23) are
only on-shell and will not aect the variarional principle (the same is true for a and a).

a and 

after the above preparations we are ready to vary the action (3) with respect to a and a. as in
[24], the variation will be in the class of elds dened in (24) but varying (3) we will take into account
the surface terms:

srs = b + [ 0 ]onshell

(25)

5

(26)

(27)

(28)

where:

b = 

1

2z ddx(cid:2) i (x) gijj (x) +  i (x) gijj (x) + i (x) ijj (x)

(we recall that g = (x0)d1 and gij is the induced metric on the boundary).
the term b is nothing but the variation of the surface term at innity [24]:

+ i (x) ijj (x)(cid:3)

b = c

where:

c =

1

2z ddx(cid:2) igijj + igijj + iijj + iijj(cid:3)

note that since ii = 0 the last two terms dont contribute. the requirement for the action srs to
be stationary on the solutions of the equations of motion imposes to consider a new, improved action
of the form:

s = srs + c

(29)

it is obvious that s = 0 on-shell and reproduce the correct solutions of the equations of motion.

of course, the above boundary term is not unique. this can be achieved by imposing three natural

conditions, namely:

a) c is local
b) b is without derivatives
c) c preserves the ads symmetry.
under the above requirements c is unique.
having the explicit solutions for a and its asymptotics, one can rewrite the boundary term (up

to irrelevant for our considerations contact terms) as:

c = lim
0

1

2 zm

ddg igijj

(30)

where m is a d-dimensional surface approaching the boundary   0 and g in the induced metric
on m. the boundary term (30) is in complete agreement with that of [19, 20].
using the explicit expressions for (i, i) and ( i, i) it is straightforward to calculate the cor-
relation functions produced on the boundary. since the rarita-schwinger action is zero on-shell the
contributions will come only from the boundary terms (28). according to the ads/cft correspon-
dence principle one must replace i and i in (28) with their on-shell values (23). the substitution
gives:

sclass =z ddp

3 massive case

we proceed with the analysis of the boundary term in the case of massive rarita-schwinger eld. the
most general action is given by [5]:

smrs =z ddxg(cid:2) d  m1   m2  (cid:3)

the equations of motion following from (33)

can be rewritten in more convenient form [19, 21]:

d  m1  m2  = 0

 (d  d)  m +

 = 0

m+
d  1

(33)

(34)

where we use the notations of [21]: m = m1  m2. applying the standard procedure of passing to
at space equations (a = e
a) it is straightforward to obtain the equations for 0 and i [19, 21]:

and analogous expression for conjugated elds. since we have two rather dierent leading terms (of
powers d/2  c and d/2  m), some of the solutions have to be xed to zero, i.e. we must x 0 or
i. a natural criterion for this is the requirement that in the limit m2  0 to reproduce the massless
case. this uniquelly determine 0 = 0. the same arguments as in the massless case for regularity of
the solution in the interior of the ads relate +
i which reminiscent again the principle that
only a half of the components can be xed on the boundary. 5 in order to extract the contribution
to the boundary we will use the small argument expansion of the modied bessel function (17). the

from the above formulae follows that the two expressions (49, 50) are not independent and a half of
the boundary data can be expressed (on-shell) in terms of the other half.

we now turn to the variational principle applied to the action for the massive rarita-schwinger
eld (33). repeating the same considerations as in the massless case we have found the boundary
terms in the same form 6 :

c =

1

2z dd(cid:2) igijj + igijj + iijj + iijj(cid:3)

which again can be written as in the massless case:

c = lim
0

2 zm

ddg(cid:0) igijj + iijj(cid:1)

(51)

(52)

the action ensuring that the classical solutions are true stationary point of the action (33) gets the
modication:

s = smrs + c

(53)

which is unique under the requirement of locality, absence of derivatives and presevation of the ads
symmetry.

now, using (49, 50) it is straightfoward to reproduce the correlation functions in the cft living

on the boundary found in [21]:

(cid:21)
note that in the massless limit m2  0 the above result coincide with (32).

 (x, y) 

|x  y|2

6we note that since ii = 0 the 3th and 4th terms in (51) and the second term in (52) below will not contribute.

conclusions

in this letter we have analysed the boundary term for rarita-schwinger eld in the ads/cft corre-
spondence. it is shown that, as in the spinor case, one cannot x simultaneously all the components
of the rarita-schwinger eld on the boundary but only a half of them. following [24] we used the
stationary phase method to determine the surface term. we apply variation of the action over an
appropriate class of eld congurations. since we are dealing with a theory with a boundary, it turns
out that one half of the components of the spinor eld must be kept xed but the other half are free to
vary on the boundary (at x0 = 0). we choose to impose the boundary conditions on the chiral part
of the rarita-schwinger eld (annihilated by 1/2(i  0)) which have a minimal value of the leading
term in x0. the choice is quite natural thinking of this part as of a source of the bulk-boundary green
function. the anti-chiral starts at higher power of x0 but it is shown that these components play
an important role since they contribute to the boundary term. moreover, these components are not
o-shell subject to boundary conditions.

it would be interesting to study interacting rarita-scwingerscalars in ads/cft correspondence
as in [27] and to proceed with an investigation of the s-matrix along the lines of [29, 28, 30, 31]. work
on the subject is in progress.
