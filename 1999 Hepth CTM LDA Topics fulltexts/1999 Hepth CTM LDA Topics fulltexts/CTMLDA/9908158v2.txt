we study a particular class of abelian gauged nambujona-lasinio models
with global ul(n )  ur(n ) symmetry, where n is the number of fermion a-

and four-fermion interactions in the leading order of the 1/n expansion, that
the renormalization-group  function of the u (1) gauge coupling has ultravi-
olet stable xed points for suciently large n . this implies the existence of
a nontrivial continuum limit.

i. introduction

the absence of an interacting continuum limit or triviality of abelian gauge theories in
four dimensions such as qed is due to the screening of charged particles by their interactions
with virtual fermion-antifermion pairs from the vacuum. such charge screening is described
by the vacuum polarization  (fig. 1). the qed vacuum is not a perfect insulator and
can be considered as a medium of dipoles representing the fermion loops in the vacuum
polarization. within perturbation theory, the electromagnetic charge or gauge coupling is
screened completely in the continuum limit (  , where  is the ultraviolet cuto).

this can be seen by considering the renormalization group (rg) transformation of qed
[1], which relates the gauge coupling or ne-structure constant  in the infrared (ir) region
to the bare gauge coupling 0 =  in the ultraviolet (uv) region via

 = r [/, 0] ,

r [/, 0] =

0

1 +  [/, 0]

.

in perturbation theory, the one-loop leading contribution to  is

 [/, 0] =

2n0

,

(2)

where n is the number of fermion avors. this logarithmic screening eect is sucient to
cause the complete screening of charge in the continuum limit [2,3].

from the rg point of view triviality is merely due to the absence of an uv stable xed

point or nontrivial root of the  function

for the gauge coupling. equation (2) gives rise to the  function () = 2n2/3, which
only has an ir stable xed point or trivial root:  = 0 (
(0)  0). a nontrivial or
interacting theory only arises whenever  has a root which is an uv stable xed point. in
case of asymptotic free theories such as qcd the origin  = 0 is an uv stable xed point.
in addition to its motivation only on the level of perturbation theory the above consid-
eration is too naive. according to the rg methods of wilson [4,5], one should consider the
rg ow in the space of all coupling constants (respecting certain symmetries) or at least
for those coupling constants which can be classied as relevant close to a particular critical
manifold in coupling constant space. for a possible nontrivial continuum limit of qed,
critical and hence nonperturbative dynamical eects are required.

therefore, the discovery of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (dsb) in the strong
coupling phase of qed (0  c = /3) [68] and the existence of an uv stable xed point
in the quenched-ladder approximation [911] sheds new light on the nonperturbative nature
of qed and triviality. lattice simulations of so-called noncompact quenched qed have
conrmed the existence of a continuous chiral phase transition [1214].

an important step was performed by bardeen, leung, and love in refs. [15,16]. these
authors realized that, in quenched-ladder qed, attractive four-fermion interactions de-
scribed by a dimensionless four-fermion coupling g0  0 have a so-called scaling dimension 4

2

instead of 6 at the critical gauge coupling 0 = c. consequently, these operators mix with
the gauge interaction which also has dimension 4 in four space-time dimensions; this means
that qed is not a closed theory at the chiral phase transition. the scaling dimension of an
operator is important in determining whether or not such an operator describes a long-range
interaction. the model of bardeen, leung, and love is referred to as the gauged nambu
jona-lasinio (gnjl) model, and the mechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking
proposed by them should be regarded in the context of the rg methods of wilson.

wilson pointed out that a nontrivial renormalizable model can only be formulated if the
rg transformation exhibits uv stable xed points. uv stable xed points are singular
points1 of the rg transformation at which the model becomes scale (conformal) invariant.
natural candidates for uv stable xed points are critical points governing a continuous
phase transition. since, at a continuous phase transition, the correlation length  is innite
and the model is scale invariant.

the most crucial observation of wilson is that in the rg transformation, i.e., the coarse
graining process, new types of local interactions are generated and that the new interac-
tions can be classied as either irrelevant or relevant interactions. only relevant (including
marginal) interactions are important in determining what kind of infrared dynamics char-
acterized by a scale   1/ emerges from the microscopic or bare model characterized by
the cuto . the eect of irrelevant interactions can always be absorbed by adapting the
coupling constants of relevant and marginal interactions.

especially, close to a continuous phase transition, the rg methods show that it is im-
possible, a priori (without solving the equations of motion), to determine which interactions
are relevant or irrelevant; particular interactions can acquire anomalous dimensions and in-
teractions which are irrelevant in a certain region of coupling constant space might become
relevant in another region.

in this respect the gnjl model should be considered as the wilsonian eective (or micro-
scopic) action of qed taking into account the four-fermion interactions describing neutral
scalar and pseudoscalar fermion-antifermion composites. it was shown in refs. [17,18] that
there is a critical line (curve) in the coupling constant plane (0, g0) of the gnjl model
separating a chiral symmetric phase from the chiral broken phase. the critical line is given
by

gc(0) = (1 + )2/4,

0 = 30/4.

(4)

 = q1  40,

in the neighborhood of the critical line four-fermion interactions acquire suciently large
anomalous dimensions to become relevant operators. the existence of nontrivial scaling
behavior of the model near criticality implies that these scalar and pseudoscalar composites
are relevant degrees of freedom at both short and long distances.2

lattice simulations of noncompact quenched qed with an induced four-fermion coupling
were performed by the illinois group in refs. [19,20]. the illinois group obtained a critical
point (0.44c, 0.76) in the (0, g0) plane, which ts nicely on the critical line eq. (4). however

1 uv stable xed points are specic roots of the  functions.

2the composites are light states, as well in the symmetric phase as in the broken phase.

3

it was not possible at that time to investigate by means of lattice simulations the phase
transition along the critical line.

later, the gnjl model was studied on the lattice in noncompact formulation using some
mean-eld approach for the fermions in ref. [21]. they obtained a critical line qualitatively
similar to the one following from the schwingerdyson equation (sde) approach eq. (4).

in the intermediate region (0 < 0 < c), the critical exponents describing the chiral
phase transition satisfy nonmean-eld hyperscaling relations which supports the view that,
within the quenched-ladder mean-eld approximation, the gnjl model has a nontrivial
continuum limit [19,22]. also in ref. [21] nonmean eld critical exponents were obtained.

the physical implications and the consistency of the quenched-ladder results with many
quenched lattice simulations, and with the nonperturbative rg techniques, support the view
that the qualitative features of the approach might be realistic and describe properties of
the full theory. most likely this is due to the ladder approximation respecting the vector
and axial wardtakahashi identities.

in refs. [23,24] the validity of the ladder approximation was tested positively by includ-
ing the eects of, e.g., crossed photon exchange graphs. in addition, the nonperturbative
renormalization-group methods of refs. [25,26] provide a way to check the quenched-ladder
approximation in the gnjl model by including the eect of crossed photon exchange graphs,
and four-fermion interactions in the rg ow of coupling constants. in ref. [26] the critical
line3 and critical exponents in the full quenched gnjl model were obtained in a particular
so-called local potential approximation, which incorporates besides crossed photon exchange
graphs also four-fermion exchanges beyond the mean-eld approach. considering the small
quantitative dierences, qualitatively this study supports the reliability of the ladder ap-
proximation.

attempts to include a logarithmic running of the coupling drastically changes the chi-
ral phase transition and the critical line, see refs. [2730]. moreover, it was shown in
refs. [3033] that the critical exponents are of the mean-eld type (up to logarithmic viola-
tions) leading to a trivial theory.

lattice simulations of noncompact full (unquenched) qed on the lattice (with avors,
n = 2 and n = 4) are controversial [34]. the illinois group [35,36] (see also [37,13]) and
the zaragosa group [38,39], nd power-law scaling and nonmean-eld critical exponents, sig-
naling a possible nontrivial continuum limit for the strong-coupling broken phase, whereas
[40,41,34] obtain mean-eld behavior (mean-eld critical exponents with logarithmic correc-
tions). thus gockeler et al. nd a vanishing renormalized gauge coupling and a vanishing
eective yukawa coupling (dened by the goldbergertreiman relation), and they conclude
that lattice qed is trivial, see for their most recent result ref. [42].

in this paper we argue that the four-fermion interactions might play a crucial role in the
phenomenon of charge screening. we show that, by considering the abelian gnjl model,
uv stable xed points of the  function of the gauge coupling can be realized, provided the
number of fermion avors n exceeds some critical value. the existence of uv stable xed
points gives rise to a nontrivial theory.

3they obtained the critical line: gc(0) = (1 + )2 /3, which diers by a factor 3/4 from the
quenched-ladder result.

4

an important observation is that the nonmean-eld values for the critical exponents sug-
gest the existence of a nontrivial yukawa interaction describing the interactions of the scalar
and pseudoscalar composites with fermions. this also points out the inconsistency of the
mean-eld approximation (hartreefock approximation) for the four-fermion interactions.
therefore, we go beyond the mean-eld approximation by incorporating these composites
(the  and  exchanges) in the 1/n expansion.

the setup of this paper is the following.

in sec. ii we introduce the abelian gnjl
model with ul(n)  ur(n) symmetry. furthermore, we sketch how we will search for the
existence of an uv stable xed point in the coupling constant plane (0, g0). in sec. iii
we discuss, within the quenched-ladder mean-eld approximation, the importance of hyper-
scaling relations and how this is related to the existence of a nontrivial yukawa interaction
in the gnjl model. we discuss how to proceed beyond the quenched mean-eld approxi-
mation in sec. iv. the 1/n expansion is discussed in sec. iv b. in order to get some idea
how the scalar and pseudoscalar composites contribute to vacuum polarization we illustrate
such contributions on the level of perturbation theory for a gaugehiggsyukawa model in
sec. v. then, in sec. vi, we argue how we can exploit the 1/n expansion and derive a
computable expression for the  function, , of the gauge coupling. subsequently,  is
computed explicitly in sec. vii. the existence of uv stable xed points is addressed in
sec. viii. finally, we present our conclusions in sec. ix.

ii. the abelian gnjl model

we consider the gnjl model with u(1) gauge symmetry (the abelian gnjl model) with
n number of fermion avors described by the following lagrangian (see also refs. [43,44]):

l1 = i(id  m0)i 

1
4

ff  +

g0
2

n 21

x=0 (cid:20)(cid:16) i 

ijj(cid:17)2

+(cid:16) i 

ij(i5)j(cid:17)2(cid:21) ,

(5)

where d =   ie0a and where the avor labels i, j run from 1 to n. the lagrangian
l1 is parametrized by the following three dimensionless bare coupling constants:

0 = m0/  m,

0 = e2

0/4  ,

g0 = g02/42  g,

(6)

where  is the ultraviolet cuto. we assume that the above set of dimensionless coupling
constants comprises the entire set of relevant (including marginal) dimensionless coupling
constants respecting particular chiral, vector, and gauge symmetries.

if the bare mass m0 is zero, l1 has a global ul(n)  ur(n) symmetry. the generators,

 , of the u(n) lie algebra have the following properties:

  =  ,

tr    = ,

n 21

x=0

 
ij 

kl = ilkj.

(7)

the last identity is called the fierz identity.

the abelian gnjl model described by eq. (5) can be conveniently analyzed in terms
of auxiliary or composite elds  = g0   and  = g0  (i5) describing scalar
and pseudoscalar degrees of freedom. in this way l1 can be rewritten as

5

l2 = iidi 

1
4

ff  

n 21

x=0

i 

ij( + i5)j 

1

2g0

n 21

x=0 h()2 + ()2i ,

(8)

where m0 has been set to zero. in this formulation the four-fermion interactions are described
by the interactions of the auxiliary elds with the fermion elds. then the connected two-
point green functions of the  elds describe n 2 nambugoldstone bosons ( bosons) and
the connected two-point green functions of the  elds describe n 2 higgs bosons (
bosons).

although the lagrangian (5) has very interesting properties, surprisingly this particular
class of gnjl models with ul(n)  ur(n) has not received much attention. one such
property is that eq. (5) comprises the largest set of relevant chiral invariant four-fermion
operators for a model of n fermions. another independent set of vectorlike chiral invariant
four-fermion interactions such as ( )2 do not acquire large anomalous dimensions and
remain irrelevant near the critical point (line). this has been shown in refs. [25,26], where
the rg ow of scalarlike chiral invariant and vectorlike chiral invariant four-fermion inter-
actions has been considered. moreover, the specic form of the chiral symmetry, where the
number of scalars equals the number of pseudoscalars, turns out to have useful implications
in the context of 1/n expansions as we will discuss later in sec. iv.

in case of l2 there are four renormalization constants:

2

(/)()(x) = (x), z 1/2

z 1/2
z(/)()(x) = (x), z(/)()(x) = (x),

(/)a

()(x) = a(x),

3

(9)

(10)

where /  1, and the elds , a, ,  are the bare elds dened at the uv cuto .

near the critical point a new scale is generated: the correlation length . in case of a
second-order type of phase transition, the correlation length exists in both phases of the
system. in the broken phase the inverse correlation length is real and can be considered as
a physical mass of particles, for instance the mass of the scalar bound state (the  boson)
m, or the mass of fermion mdyn. in the symmetric phase the fermion is massless, and the
scalar and pseudoscalar composites are unstable states characterized by a complex mass
pole in their respective propagators describing the mass and the width of the breitwigner
type resonance, see refs. [4547]. the absolute value of the complex mass pole |m| can be
considered as the inverse correlation length, i.e., |m|  1/.

the rg transformation dictates the ow of the dimensionless bare couplings as function
of the uv cuto . typically the bare relevant and marginal couplings (e.g., 0, 0, g0) have
to be ne-tuned suciently close to the critical point in order for scaling behavior to set in,
so that the physics in the infrared can be related to experimental data. scaling behavior is
obtained when there is a large scale hierarchy between the infrared length scale  and the
ultraviolet length scale a = 1/, i.e.,   a.

the ne-tuning depends on the eigenvalues of the rg transformation of the couplings
close to the critical point and hence on the critical exponents. these critical exponents can
be derived from the  functions for the coupling constants 0, 0, and g0;



d0
d

= (0, 0, g0), 

d0
d

= (0, 0, g0), 

dg0
d

= g(0, 0, g0).

(11)

the crucial step is determine the xed points (, , g) of the rg equations (11), i.e.,

6

(, , g) = 0,

(, , g) = 0,

g(, , g) = 0,

(12)

since the nature of the xed point determines whether a nontrivial continuum limit can be
realized or not. for a nontrivial continuum limit (, , g) should be a uv stable xed
point.

the rg equations follow from the regularized sdes of the generating functional de-
scribed by the lagrangian (8).4 the uv stable xed point for  is  = 0, hence we can
write



d0
d

  (1 + m) 0,

(13)

where m is the anomalous dimension of the mass operator  evaluated at the xed point
(, , g). in the case of the quenched gnjl models 1  m  2. thus the dimensionless
bare mass 0 is a relevant coupling requiring ne-tuning.

after setting 0 =  = 0, the problem reduces to the determination of the uv stable

xed points in the coupling constant plane (0, g0): i.e.,

< 0,

< 0.

(14)

(15)

g(, g) = 0,


g(, g) =

g(, g)

g

(, g) = 0,


(, g) =

(, g)



(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(,g)=(,g)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(,g)=(,g)

the quenched-ladder approximation simplies the solutions of eqs. (14) and (15) con-
siderably since the quenched hypothesis explicitly sets  = 0 for all 0 by omiting fermion
loops. it was shown in ref. [48] that, in the symmetric phase (g0  gc),

g(0, g0) = 2

g0
gc

(g0  gc),

(16)

with  and gc given in eq. (4). in the next section, eq. (16) will be derived. clearly, in this
way, the uv stable xed point of g is the critical line;

g = gc(0),

g(0, gc(0)) = 0.

(17)

now eq. (15) should be reconsidered. we will analyze eq. (15) beyond the quenched ap-
proximation, and try to solve

(0, gc(0)) = 0.

(18)

in sec. vi an explicit expression for  will be derived by assuming that g0 is at its critical
value gc and that it has an uv stable xed point so that in the neighborhood of this point
  0.

4a derivation of the set of (full) sdes for the two and three-point functions is given in chap. 2
of [44].

iii. hyperscaling in the quenched-ladder mean-field

approximation

in analogy with statistical mechanics, the continuous chiral phase transition can be
classied in terms of critical exponents which describe the scaling of various macroscopic
quantities (e.g., the chiral condensate, correlation length, eective potential, chiral suscep-
tibility) close to or at the critical point. it is considered a strong indication of the existence
of a nontrivial continuum limit (  ), if so-called hyperscaling relations between these
various critical exponents are satised, see refs. [19,22,4951].

because the  boson propagator s is the connected correlation function of the eld
 describing correlations parallel to direction of symmetry breaking (i.e., parallel to the
direction of long-range ordering), the absolute value of the mass, m, of the  boson, which
is given by s, is the natural candidate for the inverse correlation length.

in the quenched-ladder approximation treating four-fermion interaction in a mean-eld

approximation, the critical exponents are

 =

2 + 
2  

,

 =

2  

2

,

 =

1
2

,

 = 1,

and satisfy the hyperscaling relations

 = (  1),

4 = 2 + .

(19)

(20)

other hyperscaling relations involving the critical exponent  describing the scaling of the
eective potential are satised too [19,22]. furthermore, it was argued in [19] that the
validity of the quenched-ladder mean-eld approximation relies on the verication that the
critical exponent  = 1. the interpretation of  = 1 is the factorization ( )2 = 2( ).
a renormalization of the chiral condensate simultaneously renormalizes the propagators s
and p .
indeed the lattice computations of the critical exponent  reported in [1921]
showed strong evidence for  = 1.

the anomalous dimension  describes the scaling of the connected two-point green
function s at the critical point. in ref. [47] the scalar propagator s (see fig. 2) and the
scalar yukawa vertex s (see fig. 3) have been computed in the symmetric phase in the
quenched-ladder approximation by means of a so-called two-channel approximation.

in the symmetric phase the yukawa vertex has the following form:

s(p + q, p) = 1 [f1(p + q, p) + (q p  pq) f2(p + q, p)] .

(21)

these vertex functions f1 and f2 can be expanded in terms of chebyshev polynomials of
the second kind, e.g.,

f1(p + q, p) =



xn=0

fn(p2, q2)un(cos ),

cos  =

p  q
pq

.

(22)

the two-channel approximation of ref. [47] now holds in that the yukawa vertex is approx-
imated by the angular average of the vertex function f1 in the following way:

s(p + q, p)  1z dp

22 f1(p + q, p) = 1f0(p2, q2),

(23)

8

where

f0(p2, q2)  fir(p2, q2)(q2  p2) + fuv(p2, q2)(p2  q2).

(24)

the functions fir and fuv are, respectively, referred to as the ir channel (infrared), and
the uv channel (ultraviolet). the specic choice of chebyshev expansion and consequently,
the choice of zeroth-order coecient f0, is convenient, since the infrared limit (q2  p2),
and ultraviolet limit (q2  p2) of s are both described by f0. the scaling form for s(q)
is well described by these two functions fir and fuv.

the zeroth-order chebyshev expansion or two-channel approximation gives second-order
dierential equations for the lowest order harmonic with appropriate ir and uv boundary
conditions. these dierential equations are exactly solvable and the solutions are expressed
in terms of a bessel function of the rst kind for fir and in terms of modied bessel functions
for fuv. the solutions are given in [47].

with the asymptotic solutions for s given in terms of fir and fuv, an analytic

expression for the  boson can be obtained from

s(q2) =

2
42

1

0 hfuv(2, q2)  1i ,

1

s (q) = 

1
g0

+ s(q2),

(25)

which has been argued in [47] to be correct up to leading and next-to-leading order in q2/2
and is valid along the entire critical curve gc.

also one can derive that the solutions for s and are consistent with hyperscaling for
0 < 0 < c. this is intimately related to the fact that the renormalization of the auxiliary
elds  and , eq. (10), simultaneously renormalizes the yukawa vertex and the scalar
propagator.

near g0 = gc (with |m|2, q2  2) the scalar propagator s has the scaling form

[44,4951] (in euclidean formulation):

s(q) =

1

2   2

q2!1/2

f(|m|2/q2),

f(x)

(28)

(29)

(30)

it has been shown in [45,47] that s has a complex pole on a second riemann sheet in
(minkowsky) momentum space. the mass m is the complex pole of s and the absolute
value |m| scales according to |m|  (g0). more precisely, in [45,47] it is derived that

9

|m|  " g0

gcg0b()#1/2

,

g0 = g0  gc.

(31)

the absolute value of m is taken to be the physical, macroscopic or infrared mass scale,
which by denition should be independent of . using eq. (31), we can derive the  function
of g0 by assuming that

0 = 

d|m|

d

= g(0, g0) = 2

g0
gc

(g0  gc),

(32)

which is equivalent to the  function given in ref. [48] and sec. ii. hence the critical curve

g(0, gc) < 0) of the rg ow.

in accordance with ref. [47], the scaling form for the yukawa vertex can be written as

s(p + q, p)  1 2

q2!/4

where, for p2, q2  2,

hfir(cid:16)p2/q2(cid:17) (q2  p2) + fuv(cid:16)q2/p2(cid:17) (p2  q2)i ,

from the above scaling form for s and s it is clear that four-fermion scattering amplitudes

are independent of  and express the long-range nature5 of yukawa forces. for dimensions
2 < d < 4, this was pointed out in ref. [46]. the long-range yukawa forces and their
nontrivial contributions to scattering amplitudes in the infrared are a direct consequence of
hyperscaling and thus powerlike renormalizability.

the consensus is that in four dimensions due to the logarithmic corrections, the hy-
perscaling relations are violated for the pure njl model and 4 theory, and we have the
following inequalities:

5the correlation length is large, 1/|m|  1/.

10

4 > 2 + ,

(38)

see ref. [52] for an extensive discussion regarding this issue. this violation of hyperscaling is
believed to be a sign of triviality meaning that the eective yukawa coupling (which couples
goldstone bosons to the fermions) vanishes in the continuum limit. the continuum limit
is noninteracting, hence trivial. this can be seen in the following way. assuming that in
the low-energy region the correlation length  is the only relevant length scale, we dene
an eective yukawa coupling gy by the zero-momentum limit of the four-fermion scattering
amplitude (two fermions exchanging a scalar bound state) in the dsb phase

this expression is related to the denition of gr  g2

the scaling inequalities (38) imply that g2
y  0 when   . thus, only if the hyperscaling
relations (20) are satised, a nonzero gy might be realized in the continuum limit (  ),
thereby giving rise to a nontrivial interacting theory.

iv. beyond the quenched-ladder mean-field approximation

the quenched approximation is analogous to the assumption that the full photon prop-

agator

d(q) =  g +

can be approximated by the bare or canonical propagator (q) = 1/q2 (for large momenta),

d(q) =  g +

qq

q2 ! 1
q2 ,

(43)

in the landau gauge (a = 0). the quenched approximation is only consistent when the
vacuum polarization is nite in the continuum limit, i.e., the logarithmic running of the
coupling is absent. this is the case at an uv stable xed point of the  function, eq. (15),
of 0. the assumption that such a critical xed point exists, and that it lies somewhere on
the critical curve (4) is the starting point for many studies of dynamical chiral symmetry
breaking in context of the gnjl model.
in fact, the quenched hypothesis (43) is only

11

consistent when the bare gauge coupling 0 is near the xed point of the theory,   0.
we discuss this issue in more detail in sec. vi.

in many approximations of the gnjl model, the four-fermion interactions are treated in
a mean-eld approach known as the hartreefock approximation. in mean-eld approxima-
tions the composite operators such as  are replaced by their vacuum expectation values
(   h i) and uctuations about that value are ignored. thus quantum corrections
corresponding to four-fermion interactions are neglected beyond tree level.

as long as four-fermion interactions are irrelevant the mean-eld approach for these
operators is justied. however, in refs. [19,22] it is concluded that, within the quenched-
ladder mean-eld approximation to the gnjl model, the hyperscaling equations for the
critical exponents are satised, implying that the four-fermion operators become relevant due
to the appearance of large anomalous dimensions. in other words, the mean-eld approach
yields non-mean-eld exponents, thereby being inconsistent (e.g., see refs. [21,50]). as was
discussed in sec. iii, the hyperscaling relations imply the existence of a nontrivial yukawa
interaction describing the interaction between fermions and  and  composites in the gnjl
model at both short and long distances.

in order to go beyond the mean-eld approach, we propose the following. first, we point
out the usefulness of skeleton expansions. second, we make use of the specic form of the
chiral symmetry and adopt the 1/n expansion (with n the number of fermion avors).

a. the skeleton expansion

the non-mean-eld values of the critical exponents imply that one cannot neglect (as is
done in mean-eld approximations) the full connected green functions corresponding to the
composites (or at least the leading or asymptotic parts of these functions) in the sdes.

on the level of the bethesalpeter (bs) fermion-antifermion scattering kernels the  and
 composites can be incorporated in a rg invariant manner by making use of the skeleton
expansion, e.g., see ref. [53]). analogous to qed kernels we dene the one-boson irreducible
kernel k (1), and the two-fermion one-boson irreducible bs kernel k (2), where these kernels
now also include the  and  composites. for both type of kernels a skeleton expansion
exists. the integral equation between k (1) and k (2) is known as the bethe-salpeter equation.
the skeleton expansion is a series in topologically distinct feynman diagrams with all
vertices and propagators fully dressed. the skeleton expansion is a special way of resumming
the entire set of feynman diagrams in a consistent manner, i.e., without double counting.
the lowest order terms (lowest in terms of loops) of the skeleton expansion for k (2) is
illustrated in fig. 4. the blobs with the letter b in the full vertices and propagators
represent photons, and composite  and  exchanges.

each term in the skeleton expansion of the bs kernel k (2) is rg invariant, up to fermion
wave function factors, i.e. the expansion is independent of the renormalization factors z3 and
z = z = z (see eqs. (9) and (10)) of, respectively, the gauge eld and the composite elds
 and . the two z 1 factors with anomalous dimensions of each yukawa vertex cancel with
the z 2 factors of the  and  propagators, leading to cuto independent fermion-antifermion
scattering amplitudes, e.g., see eq. (37).

12

b. the ul(n )  ur(n ) chiral symmetry and the 1/n expansion

as was mentioned in sec. ii, the abelian gnjl model, with n number of fermion
avors, is taken to be invariant under global ul(n)  ur(n) chiral transformations, so that
both the scalar and pseudoscalar four-fermion interactions are in the adjoint representation,
and, consequently, the number of scalar composites (n 2) equals the number of pseudoscalar
composites (n 2). in this way, when n is large we can use the 1/n expansion introduced
by t hooft [54]. this provides us with a scheme to incorporate four-fermion interactions
beyond the mean-eld approach. the 1/n expansion states that the planar (i.e., ladder)
diagrams, with fermions at the edges, describe the leading or dominant contributions to
green functions.

the interesting feature of such a 1/n expansion is that feynman diagrams can be classi-
ed in terms of two-dimensional surfaces with specic topology. diagrams with other (than
planar) topological structures are suppressed by at least factors of 1/n, and in the limit of
large n, their contribution can be neglected with respect to planar graphs. one important
rule is to draw feynman graphs with fermion loops forming the boundary of the graph (if
possible). in this way, vertex corrections are not necessarily classied as being planar.

in the context of the t hoofts 1/n expansion, we should consider internal or virtual 
and  exchanges analogous to the gluon exchanges with the important dierence that due to
the chiral symmetry we have two types of particles both being in the adjoint representation
(n 2 scalars and n 2 pseudoscalars). then, by keeping track of the avor indices within a
particular feynman diagram, we can count factors of 1/n. each fermion carries a avor
index (i), which runs from 1 to n. a virtual ,  exchange, being associated with two
yukawa vertices, carries two avor indices. therefore, as a result of the fierz identity (7),
each virtual ,  exchange gives rise to a pair of kronecker  functions connecting the avor
indices of the scattered fermions. in the context of avor indices, either a  or  boson can
be considered as a propagating fermion-antifermion pair carrying double avor indices.

whenever a trace over a avor kronecker  function enters into the expression for a
particular feynman diagram, we speak of an index loop. an index loop is easily identied
by using the double-line representation of t hooft. a fermion propagator is represented by a
single index line (i.e., fermion line), whereas each internal scalar, respectively, pseudoscalar
propagator is represented by a double index line. consequently, whenever, after drawing a
particular feynman diagram, an index line closes, it forms an index loop giving rise to a
factor n = tr .

the topology of the feynman diagram determines the factors of n. the vacuum polar-
ization has the topology of a sphere with a single hole (i.e., a disk), where the fermion-loop
forms the boundary (i.e., hole) of the graph. it can be shown straightforwardly, that planar
diagrams in the vacuum polarization with n exchanges of s and s are associated with
a factor n n+1g2n
y , where gy is an eective yukawa coupling describing the interaction
of scalars and pseudoscalar with fermions. for the time being we leave unspecied such a
coupling.

in absence of bare mass, the ul(n)  ur(n) symmetry allows us to write each full
yukawa vertex, photon-fermion vertex, fermion propagator, and ,  boson propagator as

because of the fierz identity (7). then the rst term of the skeleton expansion for k (2) is

+ i2j1i1j2(ie0)

cb(p + q, p)id(q)(ie0)

ad(k, k + q).

(48)

as a result of the chiral symmetry the contributions of four-fermion interactions, which
are represented by  and  exchanges, exhibit two distinct features depending on whether
they are incorporated in sdes describing quantities connected with so-called zero-spin
structures6 (e.g., the dynamical mass , the yukawa vertices s, p , and the  and  prop-
agators s, p ), or whether the exchanges are included in sdes describing nonzero-spin
structures (anti-commuting with 5) (e.g., the vacuum polarization , the photon-fermion
vertex , and the fermion wave function z = z2). henceforth, we refer to (non)zero-spin
functions, and their equations as (non)zero-spin channels.

the chiral symmetry gives rise to the following properties.

1. in spin-zero-channels, the contribution of planar diagrams (i.e., planar in  and 
exchanges) vanishes due to the fact that the exchange of a  has an opposite sign
with respect to a  exchange. why? let us consider a planar contribution to the
scalar vacuum polarization which contains (amongst others) a  exchange. both 5
matrices corresponding to this particular planar  exchange can be eliminated from
the fermion trace of the scalar vacuum polarization by moving them to the right-hand
side of the trace. for planar diagrams such a process involves the interchange of the
5 matrix with an even number of fermion propagators, and an arbitrary number of
yukawa vertices. since the yukawa vertices commute with the 5 matrix, and 5 anti-
commutes with the fermion propagator7 s, the process of moving the 5 to the right
does not introduce an overall minus sign. now using that (i5)(i5) = (1)(1), we
see that the diagram containing a specic planar  exchange is identical to minus the
same diagram with the  exchange replaced by a  exchange. since each diagram
containing a  exchange has a scalar counter part (i.e., an analogous diagram with a

6such structures are characterized by spinor matrices which commute with the 5 matrix.

7in the symmetric phase 5s = s5.

14

 instead of a  exchange), the sum of all planar diagrams, with a particular number
of exchanges, vanishes.

2. in nonzero-spin channels (think of , , etc.) containing vertices which anti-commute
with the 5 matrix, the situation is dierent: planar  and  exchanges contribute
with identical sign. let us now consider a planar contribution to the (photon) vacuum
polarization containing a  exchange. if we again move the 5 matrices to the right-
hand side of the trace, we get an overall minus sign due to the anti-commutation of 5
with . this means that any planar diagram in the vacuum polarization containing
a  exchange is identical to the same diagram with the  exchange replaced by a 
exchange.

the properties described above are, strictly speaking, only valid in the symmetric (massless)
phase, where the (2n 2)  and  bosons are degenerate. however, in the broken phase,
the properties are valid whenever momenta larger than the dynamical mass  or m are
considered, because then the degeneracy emerges too.

these properties also provide us with a general argument why the mean-eld approach
for four-fermion operators for green functions corresponding to spin-zero channels (e.g.,
s and s) is reliable. for such channels planar contributions vanish and the next non-
vanishing contributions (such as contributions containing crossed  and  exchanges) are
proportional to 1/n, thus small for large n. this implies that quantities such as the critical
curve, dynamical mass, anomalous dimensions etc., are nearly independent of n, and are
described rather well by the mean-eld approach. to the contrary, the cancellation of scalars
against pseudoscalars degrees of freedom does not occur in the vacuum polarization  which
is a nonzero-spin channel.

c. the fermion wave function

the inclusion of relevant four-fermion interactions beyond the mean-eld approach re-

quires a reinvestigation of the sde for the fermion wave function z = z2 (eq. (9)),

s(p) =

z(p2)

p  (p2)

,

(49)

with s the fermion propagator and  the dynamical mass. in qed in the quenched-ladder
approximation, the fermion wave function has a gauge dependent anomalous dimension. in
the landau gauge, this anomalous dimension vanishes and z = 1.

we conjecture that the inclusion of relevant four-fermion interactions does not introduce
an anomalous dimension for the fermion wave function other than already introduced by the
gauge interactions. thus, in the landau gauge, the wave function z is nite though it might
deviate from unity. the main argument in support of the conjecture stated above is that
only one full yukawa vertex appears in the self-energy part, which means that anomalous
dimensions of four-fermion interactions are not canceled. only two fully dressed yukawa
vertices and a fully dressed scalar composite are rg invariant (anomalous dimensions can-
cel). consequently a remnant power of the cuto (related to anomalous dimension of a
yukawa vertex) lowers the degree of divergence of the self-energy part from a logarithmic
divergence to a nite integral. therefore, throughout this paper we assume z = 1.

15

a nice feature of the assumption that z = 1 is that with the gauge interaction treated
in the quenched-ladder approach the chiral and vector wardtakahashi identities (wtis)
are preserved, since in channels with spin-zero the planar  and  exchanges cancel each
other.

v. scalars, pseudoscalars, and charge screening

since, in the gnjl model, the scalars and pseudoscalars are neutral states which there-
fore do not couple to the photon eld, their contribution to the vacuum polarization is
described indirectly in terms of photon-fermion vertex corrections, and fermion self-energy
corrections. hence, in order to gain some intuition for the role of scalar degrees of freedom
on the mechanism of charge screening, we analyze the two-loop contribution arising from 
and  exchanges to the vacuum polarization.

let us consider an abelian gaugehiggsyukawa type of interaction described by the

lagrangian8

(50)

where the potential v contains, e.g., mass terms, and a 4 type of interaction (i.e. a quartic
scalar interaction). for simplicity, we ignore the eect of the potential v . in appendix a,
the two-loop contribution to  has been computed for the special case of n = 1, see also
fig. 5. if the scalar and pseudoscalar elds in eq. (50) are both in the adjoint representation
of u(n), the result, for arbitrary n, reads

the interesting result of this computation is dierence in sign between terms corresponding
to photon exchanges, and terms corresponding to (pseudo)scalar exchanges. from this point
of view, the fundamental scalars and pseudoscalars in a gauge-higgs-yukawa system tend to
decrease charge screening. furthermore, we might be tempted to conclude that a nontrivial
root of eq. (52) could be realized whenever ny /2  2/3. however, the complete situation
is more involved. the rg equation for, e.g., y should be considered too, i.e., we should
compute the  functions of y , and of any quartic scalar coupling. if and only if a nontrivial
(nonzero) uv stable xed point for y exists, the realization of a zero of eq. (52) becomes a

realistic option. in other words, such a scenario is only possible if the yukawa interaction y
is nontrivial. the discussion in sec. iii implies that in order to obtain a nontrivial yukawa
coupling, the hyperscaling laws should be obeyed. the idea is that, nonperturbatively, close
to the critical curve in the gnjl model, the scalar and pseudoscalar yukawa interactions
are nontrivial, and kinetic terms for the scalar and pseudoscalar composites are eectively
induced via the appearance of a large anomalous dimension.

vi. the vacuum polarization in the 1/n expansion

the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the existence of an uv stable xed

point (, g) of the gauge coupling, so that

(, g) = 0,

  

(, g) > 0,

(53)

with  a critical index characterizing the rg ow in the neighborhood of (, g). with 
close to  the  function linearizes as

(, g)  (  ).

(54)

the  function for the gauge coupling follows from the rg transformation relating the
charge x at scale x to the charge y at scale y via

x = r [x/y, y, gy] =

y

1 +  [x/y, y, gy]

,

 [1, x, gx] = 0,

(55)

where (x2) =  [x/y, y, gy] is the (euclidean) vacuum polarization. the rg transforma-
tion should satisfy the rg semigroup property (with x < y < z)

r [x/y, y, gy] = r [x/z, z, gz] = r [x/y, r [y/z, z, gz] , rg [y/z, z, gz]] ,
r [x/y, , g] = r [x/z, , g] ,

(56)
(57)

where rg is the rg transformation for g, satisfying analogous equations. then the 
function for  is dened as

(x, gx) 

r [w, x, gx]

 ln w

the rg semigroup property (56) gives rise to the well known dierential rg equation

whose solution is

to obtain a nontrivial theory in the ir the existence of an uv stable xed point is required.
close to the uv stable xed point ( = g = 0), with gy = g, we have that

(61)

(62)

which is the solution of eq. (59) using eq. (54). the above expressions are only valid if both
x and y are in the neighborhood of the uv stable xed point , therefore we have the
ne-tuning condition:

(y  )



(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

x(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:18) y

 1,

(63)

which in case of y  x implies that y is tuned suciently close to .

in case of the abelian gnjl model the gauge coupling q in the infrared (ir) region is
related to the bare gauge coupling 0 via the rg transformation q = r [q/, 0, g0], where
the four-fermion interactions contribute to the vacuum polarization  (fig. 1) through the
full photon fermion vertex, see fig. 6. assuming that the hyperscaling laws are satised, we
can write the vacuum polarization for   q  |m| (i.e., near gc(0)) as

 [q/, 0, g0] = f(1)(0, g0) ln


q

+ f(2)(0, g0) ln



q!2

+ f(3)(0, g0) ln



q!3

+ . . . ,

(64)

where each factor of ln /q corresponds to a single fermion loop with two outgoing photon
lines. thus the function f(1) represents the contribution of all diagrams to  in which the
internal photon propagators are replaced by the bare or canonical form.

in order for  to give rise to a rg transformation satisfying eqs. (55) and (56), it can
be derived from eq. (60) that the functions f(1), f(2), and f(3) should be related to  in the
following way:

f(1)(, g) = (, g),

f 2
(1)  f(2) =

f 3

these identities are nontrivial and require a high degree of self-consistency of the theory in
the form of ward identities.9 since, within our approximation scheme, the ward identities
are respected, we assume that eqs. (65)(67) are satised. equation (65) now relates the 
function to the function f(1). clearly the  function has a gaussian or trivial xed point at
0 = 0.

from this we also have that with 0   at g0 = g (see eqs. (54), (62), and (63)):

9the proof of eqs. (65)(67) can be performed order by order within perturbation theory.

the second term on the right-hand side of eq. (69) will only contribute via internal photon
propagators to the functions f(2), f(3), etc. and not to the function f(1). in order to nd
an uv stable xed point of , we only have to compute f(1) and, therefore, we neglect
all corrections to (q) other than canonical in internal photon propagators. because the
contribution of  is neglected, this procedure is identical to quenching the internal photon
propagators, although it is not quenched in the sense of taking n  0!

now in correspondence with eq. (18) we search for uv stable roots of eq. (65), i.e.,
f(1)(0, gc(0)) = 0. in case of pure qed (without four-fermion coupling) the function f(1)
has been studied thoroughly by johnson et al.
in refs. [5658] and by adler [59] in the
context of massless qed. in ref. [56], an expression for f(1) is obtained in term of the bs
kernel k (2) (sec. iv) as the single unknown green function.

we mention that, although the strong belief of johnson et al. in the possible existence
of nite qed seems poorly motivated from the point of view of wilsons rg methods [5],10
their methods and techniques are sound and directly applicable to the gnjl model.

in appendix b, we expose a brief derivation of the result of ref. [56] and point out
the applicability to the abelian gnjl model. then, by taking into account also relevant
four-fermion interactions at g0 = gc(0) via the bs kernel, we can derive from eqs. (b1) and
(65) that

the bs kernels in eqs. (71)(73) contain, in principle, all diagrams except those cor-
responding to vacuum polarization corrections, since all internal photon propagators are
canonical or quenched. as was pointed out in sec. iv, the 1/n expansion states that
the planar diagrams for the  and  exchanges are dominant. the approximation for the
bs kernel k (2), which generates the entire set of planar scalar and pseudoscalar skeleton
diagrams including ladder photon exchanges for the vacuum polarization is the following:
the bs kernel k (2) is approximated by its lowest order skeleton graph, i.e.,

in the symmetric phase, the decomposition of the scalar yukawa vertex s is given by

eq. (21). furthermore, due to chiral symmetry, we have the identities

(i5)s(k, p) = p (k, p),

s(q) = p (q),

(79)

the  and  propagators are degenerate. second, it was shown in ref. [47] that the structure
function f2 is rather small compared to the leading structure function f1 (it is assumed that
f1 describes the leading asymptotic behavior of the yukawa vertices). therefore, we neglect
contributions related to the scalar structure function f2. although it might be possible that
the contribution coming from gauge interactions is smaller than corrections resulting from
this structure function f2, we keep the gauge interaction in order to compare with results
mentioned in the literature. thus, we take for k (2)

with this truncation for the bs kernel k (2), we can actually compute the j functions
(71)(73), and subsequently analyze the  function (70). the truncation (80) generates an
innite series of planar contributions to the vacuum polarization as the leading order in
1/n, see fig. 7. as was discussed in sec. iv b and shown in appendix a up to two loops,
the scalars and pseudoscalars give the same contribution in the functions j. the trace
over avor indices yields an overall factor of n in the expressions for j for contributions
corresponding to  and  exchanges.

20

vii. computation of the  function

in computing the functions 1, 2, and 3, we initially neglect the ladder photon exchange
given in eq. (80). since such contributions were already computed in ref. [56], it will be
rather easy to include them later in the analysis.

it is straightforward to show that 2 vanishes, within the proposed approximations.

using eq. (80), we obtain from eqs. (72) and (75) that

trhp pk (2)(p, k)(k  k)i  trhp p(k  k)i = 0.

thus 2(0, gc) = 0.

where we have performed a harmless11 shift of integration, and used the fact that f1 is

overall factor n results from tracing the avor kronecker  functions, which is equivalent
to closing index lines, see sec. iv b. after a wick rotation

the function g1 is dened with a minus sign to make it a positive function, as will be shown
to be the case later. the angular integral can be performed if we make use of the following
chebyshev expansion:

11the integral is nite, therefore translationally invariant.

the chebyshev expansion for the function f1 was already introduced in eq. (22) (and [47]).
thus, following analogous derivations in the appendix of ref. [47], the function g1 can be
expressed as

g1(p2/k2) =  lim


p2s(p)

82



xl,m,n=0

clmn cl(k2, p2)fm(k2, p2)fn(k2, p2),

(89)

where the fully symmetric index clmn = 1, if l + m + n = even and a triangle with sides l,
m, n exists, i.e., |l  m|  n  l + m. otherwise clmn = 0.

we approximate g1 by keeping only the lowest order term in the chebyshev expansion,

g1(p2/k2)   lim


p2s(p)

82

c0(k2, p2)hf0(k2, p2)i2

,

(90)

where f0 is decomposed into the two channel functions fuv and fir, see eq. (24). then,
the asymptotics, k2  p2, respectively, p2  k2, of g1 are well approximated by the lowest
order chebyshev term (90). again, this is the two channel approximation for the yukawa
vertices [47]. however, for momenta k2  p2 the channel approximation is not necessarily
valid. so, how about g1(1)? since, from the appendix of refs. [47], it follows that the
chebyshev coecients

f2n(k2, p2)  0,

f2n+1(k2, p2)  0,

and from eq. (88) that

cn(k2, k2) =

(1)n

2

 c2n(k2, k2)  0,

c2n+1(k2, k2)  0.

(91)

(92)

hence, by taking into account the properties of clmn, we conclude that all terms of the series



xl,m,n=0

clmn cl(k2, k2)fm(k2, k2)fn(k2, k2)

(93)

of g1 are positive, and the lowest order term gives a lower bound on the series,

c0(k2, k2)hf0(k2, k2)i2





xl,m,n=0

clmncl(k2, k2)fm(k2, k2)fn(k2, k2).

(94)

22

therefore, the approximation eq. (90) is reliable for the asymptotics k2  p2, and p2  k2.
moreover, eq. (90) is a lower bound on eq. (89) at k2 = p2, so that at least we will
not overestimate the contribution of scalar and pseudoscalar composites to the vacuum
polarization.

the function g1 can now be computed, since f0 is expressed in terms of the channel

functions fuv and fir of eq. (24). furthermore, from eq. (88) we see that

c0(k2, p2) = (k2  p2),

(95)

and the only nonzero contribution to g1 of eq. (90) comes from the momenta k2  p2.
thus, using eqs. (90), (24), and (95), we nd

g1(p2/k2)   lim


p2s(p)

82

[fuv(k2, p2)]2(k2  p2).

(96)

as was discussed in sec. iii, the ultraviolet channel function fuv(k2, p2) is proportional to
(/p)/2 and p2s(p) is proportional to (/p). therefore, the cuto dependence cancels
in eq. (96) as was expected and the angular integral eq. (85) can indeed be written in terms
of a function which depends only on the ratio of p2/k2.

the scaling form (p2  2) for the scalar propagator s(p) at g0 = gc (m = 0) is given
by eq. (26) and eq. (28). the scaling form for the channel function fuv(k2, p2) is given by
eqs. (34) and (36), with p2  k2  2. inserting eqs. (26) (with m = 0), (34), and (36)
in eq. (96), we obtain for g1

where u = p2/k2. thus eq. (84) is

z0

du g1(u)  0.

(98)

(99)

the function g1 is positive, hence 1 is negative. the integral over the function g1 can be
done explicitly by making use of the integral identity 2.15.19.1 in volume 2 of prudnikov et
al. [60]. the result is

then, again the asymptotics, k2  p2, respectively, p2  k2, of g3 are well approximated
by the lowest order chebyshev term. moreover, for momenta k2 = p2 the approxima-
tion eq. (114) is exact, since dn(k2, k2) = 0 for all n  1. therefore, the approximation
eq. (114) is even better than the analogous approximation, eq. (90), to g1. furthermore,
from eq. (111) we see that the only nonzero contributions to g3 of eq. (114) are given by
momenta k2  p2. thus, using eqs. (114), (24), and (111), we nd

showing that 3 vanishes faster that 1 for 0  0. the functions 1(0) and 3(0) have
been plotted versus 0/c in fig. 8. first, it is clear that 1 and 3, are positive, and have
a maximum at some intermediate value of 0 < 0 < c = /3. for instance, 1 has a
maximum 1  0.123 at 0/c  0.58 (  0.65). second, the functions 1 and 3 vanish at
the pure njl point 0 = 0 in accordance with eq. (123), and at the cpt point 0 = c.
at 0 = 0, we can consider this is as a reection of the fact that hyperscaling breaks
down due to logarithmic corrections; the eective yukawa coupling is trivial, therefore
vanishes. at 0 = c, where the critical exponents become singular, the vanishing of 1
and 3 is related to the dynamics of the conformal phase transition (cpt), which has been

26

thoroughly discussed in ref. [61]. there are no light  and  exchanges in the symmetric
phase [47] which consequently implies the absence of eective yukawa interactions.12

let us compare the  function (122) with the  function (52) of the gaugehiggs
yukawa model (50) in the 1/n expansion. then, the entire set of planar  and  exchanges
is generated by the kernel

(124)

where s(p) = 1/p2. with such a kernel, 2 and 3 are zero, because the right-hand side of
eq. (124) does not depend on the momentum q. the expression for 1, in this case, can be
computed straightforwardly (y = g2

comparing the  functions (122) and (127) leads to the suggestion that 1(0) is analogous
to the yukawa coupling y in a gauge-higgs-yukawa model, 1(0)  y /2.

this is a crucial point. the general consensus is that for a gauge-higgs-yukawa model
the yukawa interaction y is trivial, thus y  0 in eq. (127). however, the situation is
essentially dierent for 1 in the gnjl model. there the eective coupling 1 is formed by
the exchange of  and  bosons, with the yukawa vertices, and (pseudo)scalar propagators
fully dressed (i.e., the skeleton expansion). the cancellation of the z factors, see sec. iii,
which is related to the fact that the hyperscaling equations are satised, gives rise to a nite
nonzero 1(0) at the critical curve (g0 = gc) for 0 < 0 < c. the other nonzero function
3 results from taking into account fully dressed yukawa vertices.

let us now the discuss the possible existence of uv stable xed points. a necessary but
not a sucient condition for the realization of an uv stable xed point is that n1 has to
be larger than both n3 and 0/2, and n1  o(1). for large n, the contribution of the
planar photon exchanges (represented by the 0/2 terms) is negligible with respect to n1
and n3. moreover fig. 8 shows, for 0 small, that 1 is considerably larger than 3. this
means that only for avors n larger than some critical value nc uv stable xed points can
be obtained.

12moreover at the cpt point four-fermion interaction are marginal instead of relevant, and start
to mix with the gauge interaction, hence the analysis becomes considerably more complicated.

27

by substituting the expressions (100) and (119) for 1 and 3 in eq. (122), we can
straightforwardly analyze the  function graphically. in fig. 9 the  function is plotted for
various values of n. figure 9 shows that for values of n > nc, with 55 > nc > 54, uv
stable xed points exist, the largest being   0.13;

n = 55 :
n = 60 :

 (0.13, gc(0.13))  0,
 (0.1, gc(0.1))  0,

 = 

 (0.13, gc(0.13))  0.07,

 = 

 (0.1, gc(0.1))  0.15.

(128)
(129)

in accordance with eqs. (15) and (53), the xed points are rst-order zeros of . the general
pattern is clear; the larger n, with n > nc, the smaller will be the uv stable xed point,
but the larger will be the critical exponent .

the above pattern also suggests that when n   the uv stable xed point   0
and we would obtain an asymptotically free theory. this is not the case. it was shown in
refs. [45,47] as 0 goes to zero that a logarithmic correction appears in the expression for
the scalar propagator s. in fact, the scaling form for s (with q/  1) is only valid for
values of  so that (q2/2)  q2/2, see ref. [47]. the logarithmic correction gives rise to
the breakdown of hyperscaling relations and is synonymous to triviality of the four-fermion
interactions (the njl model). since our results rely heavily on the existence of scaling forms
such as eqs. (26) and (34), we can only trust our results for values of  not too small.

since we have made use of results obtained in the quenched approximation, we mention
that the plots of the  function are (at the most) reliable at or in the vicinity of the uv
stable xed points at which the quenched approach is self consistent, see eq. (68).

in fig. 10, the case of n = 60 fermion avors is compared with the one-loop  function
of qed. for very small values of 0 < 1/100 indeed the one-loop qed result coincides with
that of the gnjl model, however for larger values of 0 the  function (122) deviates from
the one-loop expression, and eventually an uv stable xed point is realized at   0.1.

the analysis shows that a rather large number of avors,

n > nc  54,

(130)

is required to obtain uv stable xed points. from the point of view of the 1/n expansion
this seems a consistent result, since other than planar contributions are suppressed by at
least factors of (say) 1/nc. however, from the phenomenological point of view, the result is
unsatisfactory, since it implies that the unquenched abelian gnjl model (exhibiting uv
stable xed points) is only practically applicable for models which have at least nc fermion
avors (fractions rounded up). therefore, it is appropriate to discuss how nc depends on
the approximation.

first, we stress that the second term on the right-hand side in eq. (122) containing the
1 function causes the suppression of charge screening and is responsible for the possible
realization of an uv stable xed point. the denominator in the second term is a direct
consequence of the resummation of the innite ladder  and  exchanges, and it is mainly
due to this denominator 1 + n1 that the critical number of fermion avors nc is large.

second, the existence of an uv stable xed point for a specic number of fermion avors
n depends on the interplay between the functions 1 and 3, which are given in terms of
integrals of the functions g1 and g3. let us recall that the lowest order chebyshev expansion
for g1, eq. (90) is a lower bound on g1 of eq. (89), since all terms of the chebyshev

28

expansion are positive at k2 = p2, the same cannot be said about the approximation (114)
for g3. thus keeping more terms in the chebyshev expansion leads to an increase of 1,
whereas the eect on 3 is less clear, because of the alternating chebyshev series for 3.
therefore, an improvement of the computation of 1 will probably lead to a decrease of the
critical avor number nc.

moreover, in the computation of the functions 1 and 3 we have used yukawa vertices
(s) and  and  propagators (s) which were obtained in the quenched-ladder approxi-
mation. an interesting question is whether the improvement of the ladder approximation
for the gauge interaction (e.g., by including crossed photon exchanges) leads to a increase
of 1, and thus a decrease of nc.

finally, we recall that we have neglected the eect of the yukawa vertex function f2
(eq. (21)), but clearly the inclusion of f2 in the analysis could change the results quantita-
tively. whether such an improvement will tend to increase or decrease nc remains unclear
at this stage.

ix. conclusion

there are strong indications that four-fermion interactions become relevant near the
chiral phase transition in gnjl models in four dimensions, due to the appearance of a large
anomalous dimension. the main objective of this paper was to study the eect of such
relevant four-fermion interactions on the vacuum polarization of the gauge coupling and to
reinvestigate the problem of triviality for a particular abelian gnjl model with n fermion
avors. to obtain new results, the four-fermion interactions had to be taken into account
beyond the commonly used hartreefock or mean-eld approach.

the crucial feature of the gnjl model, within the quenched mean-eld approximation, is
that a nontrivial yukawa interaction (i.e., an interaction between composite (pseudo)scalars
and fermions) exists for 0 < 0 < c. the existence of such a nontrivial yukawa interaction
requires the cancellation of renormalization constants of the  and  elds in fermion-
antifermion scattering amplitudes such as the bs kernel k (2). this is analogous to the
requirement of hyperscaling (see sec. iii). if the hyperscaling equations are satised, then
only two of the critical exponents are independent, e.g.,  and , see eqs. (19) and (27).
the existence of hyperscaling relations between the critical exponents is intimately connected
with the existence of wardtakahashi identities (and thus the goldstone mechanism) arising
from the continuous symmetries of the model.

the skeleton expansion for the bs kernel k (2) provides a natural framework to take into
account the anomalous dimensions of yukawa vertices and  and  propagators. within
the skeleton expansion,  and  exchanges are described in terms of fully dressed yukawa
vertices and  and  propagators. the actual computation of the anomalous dimension,
and the resolution of the scaling form requires a solution of the sdes for yukawa vertices,
and  and  bosons.

in previous work such fully dressed yukawa vertices and  and  propagators have
been analyzed in the quenched-ladder mean-eld approximation, see ref. [47] and references
therein. to make use of these results consistently, we used the following approximations.
first, we assumed that the bare coupling parameters are ne-tuned close to the critical
point, i.e., close to an uv stable xed point, at which g  0 and   0. in that case, the

29

quenched or canonical approximation for the photon propagator is self-consistent. second,
the gauge-interaction is considered in the ladder form, with bare vertices. third, we used
the 1/n expansion (with n the number of fermion avors) which states that planar 
and  exchanges describe the leading contribution to green functions for large n. then,
due to the specic form of the chiral symmetry with both scalars and pseudoscalar in the
adjoint representation of the ul(n)ur(n) symmetry, we argued that in so-called zero-spin
channels (such as yukawa vertices and  and  propagators) the planar  and  exchanges
cancel each other for momenta larger than the mass of the  boson (in fact in the symmetric
phase this cancellation is exact). moreover, an important property of the planar (ladder)
approximations is that they respect the vector and chiral wardtakahashi identities.

the method of ref. [56], provides a nonperturbative framework independent of the
fermion wave function z, and allowed us to compute the contributions of the innite set of
planar  and  exchanges to the vacuum polarization. the result of the computations is
that the gnjl model exhibits an uv stable xed point, (, gc()) = 0, for any value
of n that exceeds some critical value nc (n > nc). this critical number of avors turned
out to be nc  54. the larger the number of fermion avors, the smaller the uv stable
xed point  will be, provided n > nc and  not too small. since our results are derived
on the basis of the existence of hyperscaling laws, we cannot extrapolate our results into
the region where hyperscaling breaks down due to logarithmic violations, i.e., when   0
(n  ).

from a phenomenological point of view, the large value for nc puts questions to the
applicability of the gnjl. however, we have given a few arguments in the previous section
suggesting that nc could be rather sensitive to approximations, and that an improvement
of the approximations and calculations will probably lead to a smaller value for nc.

the realization of an uv stable xed point is motivated by the observation that contri-
butions of planar  and  exchanges to the vacuum polarization, in an abelian gaugehiggs
yukawa model, have identical sign, and tend to reduce screening. in analogy, four-fermion
interactions describe attractive forces between virtual fermion-antifermion pairs in the vac-
uum polarization.

the conventional leading term in the vacuum polarization is the one-loop correction
describing the creation of fermion-antifermion pairs. these virtual pairs can be considered
as dipoles causing the screening; the vacuum is a medium of the insulator type. such a
screening is proportional to the coupling 0 and proportional to the number of fermion
avors n. however, if a particular fraction of the total amount of fermion-antifermion
pairs created are correlated by attractive four-fermion interactions, represented by  and
 exchanges, then clearly these composite neutral states are not capable of screening. the
negative term n1 in the  function (122) represents the contributions and the attractive
nature of four-fermion interactions in the vacuum polarization.

within the quenched-ladder mean-eld approximation, the critical curve and critical
exponents are independent of the number of fermion avors. within our approximation
scheme, the mechanism of charge screening clearly is avor dependent, since the total number
of virtual fermion-antifermion pairs is proportional to n and the total number of composite
scalars and pseudoscalars grows as 2n 2. the larger the number of avors, the stronger the
eect of four-fermion interactions. the xed point appears when the virtual pairs completely
loose their ability to screen.

30

the existence of an uv stable xed point implies a nontrivial continuum limit of the
abelian gnjl model. the analysis presented here suggest that in the full unquenched
gnjl model the critical line is replaced by an uv stable xed point (on the critical line)
whose exact positions depends on the number of fermion avors. if the number of fermion
avors is below some specic value, the critical four-fermion dynamics are not sucient to
yield an uv stable xed point. in that case the unquenched gnjl model only has a trivial
(ir) xed point and the chiral phase transition is of the mean-eld type.

appendix a: two-loop vacuum polarization

in this appendix we compute two-loop vacuum polarization corrections including  and
 exchanges, see fig. 5. we derive the two-loop contribution by making use of the one-loop
computation of the photon-fermion vertex [62,63].

tensor eliminates the term in  proportional to the g tensor. with this projector the
quadratically divergent contribution to , which is an artifact of a hard-cuto regulariza-

since the one-loop transverse vertex functions themselves are nite, i.e., these function
are independent of the cuto , the leading logarithmic contributions to the vacuum polar-
ization result from integrations over momenta k2  q2 in (2r) and (2i). these leading
logarithmic contribution can be found by rst deriving the k2  q2 asymptotic behavior of
the transverse structure functions given in [63], after which the integration over angles can
be performed. in the feynman gauge a = 1, the asymptotic behavior k2  q2 of the  s is

the logarithmic corrections of 2 and 6 cancel each other, and the contributions of 3 give
rise to a ln2 term.

an analogous computation can be performed for the self-energy and longitudinal vertex
corrections. due to the ballchiu expression (a27) for 
(1l), the contributions (2a) and
(2l) depend on the one-loop computation of the self-energy z(1) given in eq. (a19). after
expanding z(1)((k + q)2) for k2  q2,

z(1)((k + q)2)  z(1)(k2) + (2k  q + q2)z

and using that z(1)((k + q)2)  z(1)(q2) for q2  k2, the angular integration can be per-
formed, and the logarithmic corrections can be computed. the result is

(2a)(q2) + 1 +

(a37)

with 0 = e2
eq. (a31), we see that the overlapping divergencies (i.e., the ln2) cancel

y /4. thus, comparing this expression with the (2i) term in

0/4 and y = g2

(2a)(q2) + 1 +

0!h(2l)(q2) + (2i)(q2)i =

(a38)

such a cancellation occurs in a similar manner in any covariant gauge a. thus, the two-
loop contribution contribution to  is described solely by the part of the transverse vertex
containing the t 

8 tensor,14 i.e., (2r), and, after adding all the pieces, we deduce that

(a39)

(b1)

for the f(1) function given by eq. (64), with the functions j given by eqs. (71)(73). the
derivation of eq. (b1) was given (for pure qed) by johnson, willey, and baker (jwb)
in ref. [56]. since their result is formulated in terms of the bs fermion-fermion scattering
kernel k (2) their method is also applicable to the gnjl model.
in order to derive the result of [56], the following is assumed.

 the fermion wave function equals one, z = 1/a = 1, in the landau gauge.

in

principle, this assumption is redundant since the jwb result is valid in any gauge.

 internal photon propagators are replaced by their canonical form (q) = 1/q2 which is
self-consistent in the neighborhood of an uv stable xed point. only a single fermion
loop, thus a single power of ln  contributes to the vacuum polarization.

14as was shown in [63], this particular transverse structure function 8 does not depend on the
gauge parameter a.

 translational invariance of naively logarithmically divergent and nite momentum
implicitly, use is made of invariance under charge-

space integrals is assumed.
conjugation (c) and parity-time (p t ) transformations.

 also it is assumed that we are in the scaling region of the theory, where the only
relevant dimensionless variable is q2/2. we consider short distances with respect to
the ir length scale   1/|m|, thus |m|2  q2  2.

hence,

z(k2) = 1/a(k2) = 1,

s(k) =

k
k2 ,

(k, k) = .

the vacuum polarization tensor is

(q) =

i0

43 z

d4k tr [s(k + q)(k + q, k)s(k)] ,

(b2)

(b3)

where tr denotes the sum over both spinor and avor indices. since, in the chiral symmetric
phase, the n fermions are degenerate, all n fermion propagators and n photon-fermion
vertices are degenerate. hence, the sum over avor indices gives rise to a factor n, i.e.,
tr  ntr, where tr is the sum over spinor indices.

since vacuum polarization tensor is transverse and the only relevant momentum variable

is q2/2  1, the equation for the vacuum polarization can be written as

(q2) = 

1
6

qq
q2

2
qq (q) + o(1) + o ((q/)) ,

(b4)

where  is some positive power. after inserting eq. (b3), and setting q2 = 0 in the integrand,
and using q as the infrared cuto in the momentum integral, we obtain

from now on we omit spinor and avor indices. dierentiating now the sde eq. (b9) with

where k (2)(p, k) and the derivatives k (2)

(p, k) are dened in eqs. (74)(76).
the rst derivative of the vertex is antisymmetric in  and , because of the assumption
eq. (b2). furthermore, c and p t invariance imply that the only nonzero contribution to
the rst derivative of  (with q = 0 and   ) must be proportional to the tensor
(

k). thus we write

 (p, k) and k (2)

where  is a dimensionless scalar function.15 since s1

.

(b14)

after some algebra (taking traces over spinor and avor indices), we can derive from

eqs. (b10) and (b14) that

one-loop level

where the j functions are dened in eqs. (71)(73).
since (k) = , and using eq. (b11) for ,

 (k), the second derivative of ,


in

eq. (b8) can be eliminated. the result is

(q2) =

(b22)

where q2 is the euclidean momentum. substituting eqs. (b22) in eq. (b16), we get

(q2) =

(b23)

with eq. (64), we obtain eq. (b1). this is the main result of ref. [56]. the entire derivation
did not yet specify the bs kernel k (2). therefore eq. (b23) is applicable to the gnjl model
as well.
