abstract

we introduce a general method for transforming the equations of motion following

from a das-jevicki-sakita hamiltonian, with boundary conditions, into a boundary

value problem in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. for the particular case of a one-
dimensional chain of interacting n  n hermitean matrices, the corresponding large
n boundary value problem is mapped into a linear fredholm equation with hilbert-

schmidt type kernel. the equivalence of this kernel, in special cases, to a second order

dierential operator allows us recover all previously known explicit solutions for the

matrix eigenvalues. in the general case, the distribution of eigenvalues is formally derived

through a series of saddle-point approximations. the critical behaviour of the system,

including a previously observed kosterlitz-thouless transition, is interpreted in terms of

the stationary points. in particular we show that a previously conjectured innite series

of sub-leading critical points are due to expansion about unstable stationary points and

consequently not realized.

1 introduction

the utility of studying the statistical mechanics of systems which can be encoded in terms

of matrix variables has been evident over the past twenty years. from the generalization of

wigner and dysons work by brezin, itzykson, parisi and zuber [1] to the use of matrix models

in low dimensional gravity (see [2] for reviews), to modern implementations of matrix strings

[3], matrix models have proven to be a convenient framework for calculation. remarkably,

throughout this period the dynamics of matrix models have been considered only in the sta-

tionary case where solutions of the equations of motion are assumed to be time-independent.

there arise circumstances though where the time evolution of a system governed by an action

over matrix variables is relevant, especially if there are denite initial and nal conditions on

the state of the system. examples include two-dimensional yang-mills theory on the cylinder

and sphere [4, 5], matrix model approaches to the continuous hirota equation [6] and lattice

qcd [7] and, the case we will focus on here, linear chains of interacting hermitean matrices.

it is our goal to give a coherent framework in which in to study this class of matrix model

problems.

when an action over matrix variables can eectively be reduced to the eigenvalues, the

treatment of the eigenvalues as a single, collective coordinate [8] provides a convenient view-

point for determining the hamiltonian of the system. for the matrix actions we will consider

here the particular form is known as the das-jevicki-sakita hamiltonian [9]. the associated

equations of motion are the non-linear euler equations of uid dynamics in one dimension

and with the addition of appropriate boundary conditions present a dicult mathematical

problem. here we will show how these boundary value problems can be interpreted in the

familiar framework of the semi-classical limit of one-dimensional quantum mechanics. while

in general solutions are still dicult to obtain, we will focus our attention on the case of a
one-dimensional chain of interacting n  n hermitean matrices which was shown to be a
das-jevicki-sakita-type system by matytsin [10] in the limit of large n. in this situation a

restatement of the equations of motion in terms of quantum mechanics allows one to consider

a linear problem which is most conveniently stated as a fredholm integral equation. formal

solution of this equation in terms of iterations of the integral kernel, which can be evaluated

by saddle-point methods, will provide a framework for detailing the nature and position of

critical points which arise in the system.

an interesting system from a statistical mechanical point of view, the one-dimensional

matrix chain was discussed previously as a model for string theory with a discrete target

space [12].

in addition to this direct application, the matrix chain is related by duality

1

transformation to string theory on a circle with radius r = 1/a [13, 14], string theory at

a nite temperature [15] and to o(2) sigma models coupled to two dimensional quantum
gravity [16, 17]. the model itself consists of hermitean matrices x on the sites {x} of a
one-dimensional lattice interacting with nearest neighbours. the action of the system is

sv = axx

trv (x) xx

tr(x  x+1)2

2a

(1.1)

where a is the lattice spacing and v is the potential at each site. assuming the site potentials

v () to be analytic in , the action can be reduced to the eigenvalues of the matrix variables

by u(n) gauge rotations  and the known result for the correlator [11]

i[x, x+1] = z d en trxx+1

(1.2)

consequently, in the limit of large n, the calculation of the partition function reduces to

determining solutions of equations of motion for the eigenvalues. despite its relative simplicity

and importance in low-dimensional string theory and quantum gravity, explicit solutions of

the matrix chain are only known for a few particular choices of potential v .

in section

four we will show these cases arise when the equations of motion are equivalent to certain

sturm-liouville eigenvalue problems.

this model exhibits a remarkable range of behaviour as one adjusts the lattice spacing, a.

for instance, in the limit of vanishing a one recovers the canonical example of a das-jevicki-

sakita system, matrix quantum mechanics (restricted to a singlet sector)

sm qm = z dx tr[

1
2

2(x) + v ((x))]

(1.3)

in fact, the methods we will introduce in the next section and use to study the matrix chain

nd their most natural form when applied to such matrix mechanical systems on a nite
interval x  [0, t ].

more interestingly, xing the potential v to satisfy v  = 4, at critical lattice spacing
a = 1, the matrix chain was argued to undergo a kosterlitz-thouless phase transition [13].

the physics of this phase transition are most transparent in the dual picture of string theory

on the circle. here strings wrapping around the non-contractible target space play the role
of vortices which are liberated when the radius r  1/a becomes suciently small. in terms
of a discrete lattice, at suciently small lattice spacing a < 1 the universal behaviour of

the system is that of the continuous model (1.3) due to communication between lattice sites.

when the spacing is larger than unity this communication is broken and the system can be

expected to factorize into a product of single d = 0 matrix models, which in fact it does as
a  . the main objective of studying the matrix chain is to understand precisely how this

2

change of character from d = 1 matrix quantum mechanics to isolated d = 0 matrix models

takes place at a = 1.

in addition to a = 0 and a = 1, it was argued in [16] and [17] that at a discrete innity of

lattice spacings non-analytic behaviour arises in the distribution of eigenvalues of the matrix

variables x. considering iterative approximation of a functional solution to the equations of
motion, it was argued these critical points arise when a = sin (p/2q) where p  q are each
positive integers. in section five, where we develop the general solution for the distribution

of eigenvalues as a series of saddle-point integrations, we will show that this behaviour is not

realized in the matrix chain. in fact it will be shown that such critical behaviour arises when

unstable stationary points are mistakenly considered relevant in saddle-point approximations.

moreover, in constructing the general solution it will become clear that a countable innity of

unstable stationary points appear in intermediate steps each of which can lead to misleading

results.

in addition to the details just outlined, we recall the kazakov-migdal (lattice) model

of induced qcd as an interesting application of the techniques developed here. since the

d-dimensional model is eectively reducible to the one-dimensional case, the non-trivial be-

haviour of the matrix chain demonstrated here may help to overcome some of the apparent

deciencies of that model of gauge interaction.

2 collective eld theory to quantum mechanics

to begin we will demonstrate a non-linear change of variable which allows the equations of

motion derived from a das-jevicki-sakita hamiltonian [9]

h[, ] =

(2.1)

to be determined as a temporal boundary problem in one-dimensional quantum mechanics.

in (2.1), (x) is a probability distribution function which returns the fraction of eigenvalues

of the matrix variables  with value x. in the present context of collective eld theory, 

plays the role of a coordinate and  is the canonically conjugate momentum. here we have
included a potential v which is most generally time- dependent. independent of time, (2.1)
describes the evolution of the matrix quantum mechanics (1.3) with v = v .

the equations of motion following from this hamiltonian are given by the functional

where, for convenience, we have dened the velocity eld

v(x, t) =

(2.2)

(2.3)

explicitly we see that the equations of motion are of the form of the euler equations for a
one-dimensional inviscid uid experiencing a time-dependent force derived from v

(2.4)

as in all evolution problems we need to specify boundary conditions to supplement the

equations of motion. in the case of matrix quantum mechanics the classical treatment of [1]

assumed free boundary conditions for the evolution of the system over innite time. in this

case one is lead to a study of the ground state of the system, in which case the equations of

motion (2.4) are solved for the stationary case of v = 0. in general though we are interested

in arbitrary boundary conditions for the evolution of the system through some time t . to be

denite we will specify the generic conditions on the elds v and  at time t = 0 and t = t

(x, 0) = 0(x)

(x, t ) = t (x)

,

,

v(x, 0) = v0(x)

v(x, t ) = vt (x)

(2.5)

we would now like to rewrite the equations of motion in terms of a single quasi-linear rst

order dierential equation. introducing the complex function

f (x, t) = v(x, t) + i(x, t)

it is easy to see that (2.4) leads to

f
t

+ f

f

xv(x, t)

= 

(2.6)

(2.7)

for vanishing potential and real f this is the hopf equation which is the prototypical one di-

mensional model of an equation which admits wave solutions complete with shocks and other

inherently non-linear behaviour [18]. we would like to solve this equation with the boundary

conditions given in (2.5). while the solution of the (complex) hopf equation is known explic-

itly [10] in terms of initial data, typically we are interested in cases where boundary data is

4

supplied. in these situations the explicit solution leads to an ill-posed, inverse-type problem

for the boundary conditions. consequently we would like to nd a more natural presentation

of the problem. to this end we will consider a generalized version of (2.7) and introduce a

dispersive term [18] which will serve to smooth out the solutions and allow one to calculate

the details of the solution f in terms of boundary conditions. adding such a term leads to a

complex version of the forced burgers equation

x2 =

xv(x, t)

(2.8)

obviously, in the limit as h  0 the forced hopf equation (2.7) is recovered. the useful-
ness of this addition to the problem is that there exists a well-known (to mathematicians)

change of variable which will reduce (2.8) to a second order, linear dierential equation. this

transformation is known as the cole-hopf transform and is given

f (x, t) = 2ih


x

log (x, t)

(2.9)

as is readily veried, this transformation leads (up to an irrelevant additive constant of

integration) to the schrodinger equation

h = "h2 2

x2 + v(x, t)

#  = ih

(2.10)

consequently we see that the time evolution of the collective eld hamiltonian (2.1) is given
by the semi-classical (h  0) limit of one-dimensional quantum mechanics with the same
potential, up to a factor.

restricting to time independent potentials1 v(x, t) = v(x), the boundary conditions (2.5)

enter into the picture as the start and end points of evolution by h through time t

(x, t ) = eiht /h(x, 0)

where the wavefunction is dened in terms of the eigenvalue density and velocity

(x, t) = exp(cid:20)



2h z x

d (, t) +

i

2h z x

d v(, t)(cid:21)

(2.11)

(2.12)

given the greens function g(x, u|t ) for the schrodinger problem it may be convenient

to cast (2.11) as an integral equation

exp(cid:20)



2h z x

d vt ()(cid:21) =

1this restriction is not essential. in the general case the time evolution of the system is given by a dyson

series expansion.

5

in applications the implementation of boundary conditions and greens function varies de-

pending on the situation. for example, in investigations of the continuous hirota equation [6]
one is interested in the case of time-dependent potentials v(x, t) leading to non-trivial greens
functions. here the initial and nal velocities are specied and the initial and nal eigenvalue

distributions are identied (0 = t ) so that (2.13) takes on the form of a non-linear integral
equation for 0.

another, more familiar application is that of two-dimensional yang-mills theory [4, 5, 19].

in this case the coordinates (x, u) in (2.13) are replaced by their periodic counter-parts since

the matrix variables are unitary rather than hermitean. the greens function is that of the

heat equation on a circle and the boundary conditions on  and v specify the topology of the

two-dimensional space-time. in general these cases again lead to non-linear integral equations

for the unknown elds but as we will now see, there are situations where the general integral

equation (2.13) leads to a tractable, linear equation.

3 an application: the matrix chain

an application of the preceding formalism, which we will be investigating for the remainder of

this paper is that of the one-dimensional matrix chain. instead of (1.1), it will be convenient

to consider a dierent form of the action

su = xx

tru(x) xx

trxx+1

(3.1)

where we have rescaled the matrix eld x and the new site potential u is related to v by

u(x) = av (ax) + 2

x

(3.2)

the evolution of eigenvalues in this system, in the limit of large n, was shown by matytsin
[10] to be given by the das-jevicki-sakita hamiltonian (2.1) with vanishing potential v. here
the boundary conditions (2.5), which play a crucial role, are given by

0(x)  (x, 0) = (x, 1)
v(x, 0) = v(x, 1) =

1
2

u (x)  x

(3.3)

the objective is to solve for the initial and nal eigenvalue density 0 in terms of the potential
u.

with v = 0, and  = ih, the schrodinger equation (2.10) reduces to the linear heat
equation. substituting the well known greens function in (2.13) and implementing the

6

boundary conditions (3.3), we nd a linear integral equation of second fredholm type for the

initial eigenvalue density 0(x) = (x, 0) in terms of the eective potential u(x)

where

(x) =



4 z du e

(xu)2

4 +

x2u (x)+u2u (u)

4

(u)

(x) = exp(cid:20)

i

2 z x

d 0()(cid:21)

(3.4)

(3.5)

and we have introduced the constant  which does not aect the asymptotic solution but

is convenient for later discussion.

in this form (3.4) has the natural interpretation of an

eigen-problem with eigenvector  and associated eigenvalue . it is interesting to note that

the same integral equation arose in the context of matrix chains previously [12, 13]. in these

instances the authors were seeking the lowest lying eigenvalues  in order to calculate the
partition function. here we are most concerned with the asymptotic (  0) form of the
eigenfunctions  in order to recover 0.

hence we have re-stated the dierential form of the boundary value problem (eqns. (2.4)

and (2.5)) for the matrix chain as a well-posed, linear problem for the eigenvalue density 0.
moreover, the integral form (3.4) allows one to write equations for the eigenvalue density

immediately. formally, in the limit of vanishing , the integral in (3.4) can be calculated

by saddle-point methods. this calculation is particularly straightforward when only a single

stationary point, us contributes to the integral (3.4). this stationary point is determined by
the extrema condition

x = u (us)/2 + i0(us)

(3.6)

likewise, at this stationary point 0 can be formally evaluated using its relation to  from
equation (3.5)

us = u (x)/2  i0(x)

(3.7)

labeling x by g+ in equation (3.6) and us by g in equation (3.7), we see the saddle-point
evaluation of the integral equation (3.4) leads to matytsins solution [10] of the boundary

value problem

x = g+(g(x)) = g(g+(x))

(3.8)

this form of the solution of the problem is well-suited to detailed local analysis as demon-

strated in [16, 17]. however, for a global analysis which can accommodate the existence of

multiple stationary points, we will take the (well-studied) integral form (3.4) over the func-

tional equation (3.8). before considering the particular characteristics of solutions though,

we will utilize the interpretation of integral operators as self-adjoint operators to recover all

previously known explicit solutions 0 of the matrix chain.

7

4 integral and dierential operators

an analysis of an integral equation centers on the properties of the kernel k. in our case, the

kernel of (3.4) is

k(x, u) =

1
4

xu

2 

e

u (x)+u (u)

4

(4.1)

this positive denite kernel is real, symmetric and hence hermitean. in the following we will

assume the kernel to have many convenient properties which follow from the boundedness of

all n-fold iterations

z dx1    dxn1k(x1, x2)    k(xn1, xn) < 

(4.2)

consequently we will only consider potentials u(x) which increase at innity faster than x2.

under such conditions k denes a compact operator and represents a self-adjoint operator

on the space of square-integrable functions. from classical operator theory [20] there is a
countable innity of orthogonal eigenfunctions {n(x)} which form a complete set on this
space. it is our goal to obtain, as a function of the site potential u, the asymptotic form of

these eigenfunctions which determine the large n solution of the eigenvalue distribution 0
through (3.5).

there are a number of cases in which the kernel k is equivalent to familiar self-adjoint

operators in physics.

in fact only in these instances are explicit solutions of the large n

matrix chain known. in each case the eigenvalue distribution 0 is the solution of a quadratic
equation. here we will show that such situations arise by considering the   0 limit of
second order self-adjoint dierential operators l for which l and k dene the same action
on the hilbert space.

in order to determine the conditions that l must satisfy to be equivalent to the integral

kernel we act on  as dened by the integral equation (3.4)

nn(x) = lxn(x) = z du lxk(x, u)n(u)

likewise, acting under the integral sign and using the self-adjoint property of l

nn(x) = z du k(x, u)lun(u) = z dun(u)luk(x, u)

(4.3)

(4.4)

subtracting (4.4) from (4.3) we nd that l will be equivalent to the integral kernel k, if and
only if we satisfy the natural commutativity condition

(lx  lu)k(x, u) = 0

(4.5)

8

it follows from the symmetry of the kernel that the action of l generates symmetric functions
of x and u which will cancel out in (4.5),

lxk(x, u) = h(x + u, xu)k(x, u) = xmn

amn(x + u)m(xu)nk(x, u)

(4.6)

where h is an arbitrary function of two variables with taylor expansion coecients {amn}.
this construction is valid for any dierential operator but for simplicity we will consider

only second order dierential operators of sturm-liouville form

lx = 42 d

dx  a2(x)

d

dx! + a0(x)

(4.7)

now it is a simple matter to nd the potentials u and associated coecients a2 and a0 which
are consistent with the symmetry condition (4.6). since a second order l can only produce
quadratic polynomials in u, (4.6) leads to the equation

 a2(x)(u  u (x)/2)2  2 (a2(x)(u  u (x)/2)) + a0(x) = xm+n2

amn(x + u)m(xu)n (4.8)

expanding each side of the second equality in powers of u and equating coecients gives, to

leading order in , the result

a11x2 + (2a20 + a01)x + a10

a02x2 + a11x + a20

u (x) = 
a2(x) = (a02x2 + a11x + a20)
a0(x) = a00 + a10x + a20x2 

(a11x2 + (a01 + 2a20)x + a10)2

4(a02x2 + a11x + a20)

(4.9)

having determined the coecients a2 and a0, we can solve for the explicit form of the asso-
ciated eigenvalue distribution. the dierential form of the integral equation (3.4) is

lx(x) = e(x)

(4.10)

where the eigenvalue e is related to that of the integral form by  = ee/. in the limit of van-

ishing , the solution of this dierential equation is given simply by the wkb approximation

which implies the replacement of derivatives with momenta

d
dx  

i
2

0

(4.11)

with this substitution, (4.10) reduces to a quadratic equation in the eigenvalue distribution

which is solved by

0(x) =

vuut
= q4(a02x2 + a11x + a20)(a00 + a10x + a20x2  e)  (a11x2 + (a01 + 2a20)x + a10)2

a2(x)

(4.12)

2(a02x2 + a11x + a20)

9

since 0 is to be interpreted as a probability distribution describing the eigenvalues of the
matrix variables, it must be properly normalized. this is carried out by integrating 0 over
the positive support of (a0  e)/a2 and xing the undetermined constant e to satisfy

z dx0(x) = 1

(4.13)

integrating (4.9), we nd the most general potential of the matrix chain which is consistent

with a second order, self-adjoint dierential operator

(4.14)

contained in this general form are a number of previously examined examples of the matrix

chain. first, setting a11 = 0 and a10 = 0 recovers the symmetric double penner-type potential
rst considered by matytsin [10]. also the asymmetric double penner considered in connection

with the kazakov-migdal model of induced qcd [21] can be recovered (see [22] for recent

work).
in each of these cases the eigenfunctions  are related to prolate spheroidal wave
functions. additionally, with a20 = 1, the limit a02  0 recovers the quadratic potential case
solved by gross [23] and makeenko [24]. with u  = (a01 + 2)x  2m2x, l is the schrodinger
operator for the simple harmonic oscillator and the general expression for the distribution of

eigenvalues (4.12), properly normalized, reduces to

0(x) =

1

q2m4  1  (m4  1)x2

(4.15)

in each of these cases the analytic structure of the eigenvalue distribution (4.12) is what one

would expect of a d = 0 one-matrix model with a particular potential. this correspondence

was previously suggested for arbitrary potential in the matrix chain, but such a simple solution

of the integral equation (3.4) is not possible.

in fact with further computation it can be

argued that higher, nite, order self-adjoint dierential operators are equivalent to the integral
kernel k only if they are functions of the second order operator lx we have constructed
above. consequently, the large n eigenvalue distribution 0 of the matrix chain is the solution
of a polynomial equation only for potentials of the form (4.14). this suggests that for a

generic potential the solution of the matrix chain problem follows from the semi-classical

approximation to a pseudo-dierential operator as suggested by naively extending the results

for nite chains of matrices [25]. we will not pursue this line of reasoning here but return

in the next section to the integral form (3.4) and give a method for obtaining the general

solution and describe its unique features.

10

5 general solution and classication of critical points

a phase transition in a system is characterized by a change in the analytic structure of

observables as functions of external parameters. in standard matrix models this is commonly
taken to include a change in analytic structure of the distribution of eigenvalues2.

in the

present case we have shown that the distribution of eigenvalues for a linear chain of hermitean

matrices is determined completely by a linear integral equation (3.4) involving the kernel k

(4.1). in this section we will go further and solve for the asymptotic eigenfunctions  as a

series of iterations of k. given that iterations of k are calculable by saddle-point methods

and the relation (3.5), we can eectively solve for the distribution of eigenvalues 0.
particular we will be able to determine the critical structure of the matrix chain by analyzing

in

changes in the analytic structure of the kernel k and its iterations.

we begin by slightly generalizing the problem of nding the eigenfunctions  in order to

make use of well-known techniques [20]. instead of the integral equation (3.4) let us consider

for a moment an inhomogeneous version with c some real constant

(x) = c + z du k(x, u)(u)  c + k

(5.1)

since there are no constant eigenfunctions of the kernel k, the unique solution of (5.1) is

given by the neumann series which builds the solution up through an iterative procedure

0 = c

1 = c + k0

...

n = c + kn1

taking the limit of this process generates the solution

(x) =  1 +



xn=1

nz du k n(x, u)! c  r(x; )c

(5.2)

(5.3)

where r is commonly referred to as the resolvent kernel and k n is given by the convolution

of n kernels

k n(x, u) = z dz1    dzn1k(x, z1)k(z1, z2)    k(zn1, u)

(5.4)

2this assumption of a physical phase transition following from a change in the analytic structure of

the eigenvalue distribution does not always hold [26]. nevertheless, in the absence of calculating physical

observables, we will take a change in structure of the eigenvalue distribution to be a strong hint of a physical

transition.

11

the convergence of the resolvent kernel is guaranteed by the boundedness of k n and the

hilbert-schmidt theory of integral equations [20]. in order to recover the homogeneous solu-

tion we should set c = 0 which leads to a trivial solution for . fortunately for us only the c

independent logarithmic derivative of  is required to recover the eigenvalue distribution 0
of the matrix chain. from the denition of , (3.5) and (5.3) we have the result

0(x) = lim
0

2i


d
dx

log (x) = lim

log r(x; )

(5.5)

hence we can extract the eigenvalue distribution from the resolvent kernel r, which is

expressible solely in terms of iterations of the kernel k as dened in (5.3). this is an important

observation since the iterated kernels are calculable in the limit of vanishing . explicitly, the
nth iterated kernel can be written for n  2

evaluating the integral over ~z = {z1, . . . , zn1} is a straightforward application of saddle-
point methods in the limit of vanishing . in this limit the dominant contributions to the

integral come from the vicinity of the stationary points of the function s

= 0

(5.8)

in general there are many such stationary points, which we will label by . expanding s up

to quadratic order about the stationary points, the resulting gaussian integrations give the

(5.10)

while we have counted contributions from all stationary points of s in (5.9), the only relevant

ones are those with minimum action. the contributions of other, irrelevant, stationary points

are exponentially suppressed in the limit of vanishing .

unfortunately it is dicult to calculate the iterated kernels and the resolvent in closed

form to obtain explicit results for the eigenvalue distribution. it is possible though to extract

enough qualitative information from (5.9) to outline a one-dimensional phase diagram of the

matrix chain. to be denite we will consider a quartic potential

u() = 4 + m22

(5.11)

this simple form is convenient since it allows a clear view of the intrinsic behaviour of the

matrix chain which depends on the strength of the quadratic term.

starting with m2 large and positive we expect that the eigenvalue distribution will be

localized near the origin where the quadratic term of the potential is dominant. consequently,

the solution (4.15) for the pure quadratic potential is a good approximation to the true

solution and is smooth deformation of it. making contact with the saddle-point evaluation
of the iterated kernels (5.9) it is easy to convince oneself that for large m2 there is only one
stationary point of the action (5.7) and it is located near the origin ~z = 0. as m2 is decreased,
the solution (4.15) of the pure quadratic potential becomes unstable at m2 = 1 and in fact

this instability is present in the full solution. information about the stability of stationary
points is contained in the eigenvalues m of the hessian hn(z), which evaluated at the origin
in z-space give

m = 2m2  2 cos

m
n + 1

, m = 1, . . . , n

(5.12)

consequently we see that when evaluating arbitrarily high iterations of the kernel, k n, the
hessian at the origin will being to develop negative eigenvalues at m2 = 1 and this stationary

point becomes unstable. since s is bounded from below for our choice of potential, there are

other stationary points where s has a lower magnitude and it is these which will dominate
the integral (5.6) for k n.

this degeneration at m2 = 1 signals a phase transition in the matrix chain and the physical

meaning of it can be found by returning to the original form of the matrix chain action (1.1).

the potential there, v is related to the current u by the one dimensional lattice spacing a

through

(5.13)
taking two derivatives with respect to  and xing (without loss of generality) v (0) = 4
to agree with the conventions of [16], we nd

u() = av (a) + 2

m2 = 1  2a2

13

(5.14)

hence, the instability at m2 = 1 corresponds to the limit of vanishing lattice spacing and we

are observing a phase transition to d = 1 matrix quantum mechanics (i.e. (1.3)) from the
m2 > 1 phase where the solutions are qualitatively what one would expect from a d = 0

single matrix model. in fact this observation can be made more concrete by returning to the

integral equation (3.4) but in terms of the potential v and lattice spacing a,

e i

2r x

d 0() =



4 z du e

(xu)2

4a a

v (x)+v (u)

4

d 0()

e i

2r u

(5.15)

it is a straightforward calculation to show that for vanishing , and to leading order in van-

ishing a, (5.15) is solved by

0(x) =

1

qe  v (x)

(5.16)

which is the well-known solution for the ground state of matrix quantum mechanics [1].

as m2 is decreased further below this transition point, the stationary point of s at the

origin ~z = 0 is seen to become progressively more unstable as the number of negative eigen-

values of the hessian (5.12) increases. here the stationary points relevant to the saddle-point

integrations (5.9) are not in the neighbourhood of the origin and are stable under changes in
m2. the only instability that occurs with the relevant stationary points in this phase is due

to a zz2 symmetry of the action s. recalling its denition

s =

n1

xi=1

u(zi) 

n2

xi=1

zizi+1  z1x  zn1u

(5.17)

we see that for vanishing x and u there is a symmetry under zi  zi. it follows that a
relevant stationary point at ~z has a mirror image at ~z and as x and u are tuned through
the origin the relevant stationary point can change from one to the other. in this way non-

analytic behaviour arises in the solution of the eigenvalue distribution 0, presumably of the
form

0  |x|

(5.18)

which is consistent with the critical behaviour of d = 1 matrix quantum mechanics. of course

this detail is dicult to verify without explicit calculation.

in addition to this standard behaviour it was argued in [16] that there exist a countable

innity of additional points in this phase where the eigenvalue distribution 0 exhibits sub-
leading non-analyticities. in fact we can reproduce these results if we assume, incorrectly,

that the origin ~z = 0 is a relevant stationary point in the evaluation of 0. considering the
vanishing of hessian eigenvalues (5.12), we see that the naive saddle-point approximation to
k n+1 (5.9) will break down when

(5.19)

m
n + 1

m2 = cos

14

it is well known that at degenerate stationary points there is a change in the analytic structure

of a saddle-point approximated integral so it is natural to assume that when (5.19) is satised,

kn+1 and the eigenvalue distribution 0 will exhibit non-analyticities.
spacing the degeneracy condition (5.19) can be found by comparing with (5.14). the result

in terms of lattice

a = s 1  cos m

n+1

2

= sin

m

2(n + 1)

(5.20)

with m and n ranging over positive integers is exactly the condition for subleading critical

behaviour as found in [16]. again we stress that this behaviour is not realized in the matrix

chain and only arises when one takes into account unstable stationary points in the evaluation

of saddle-point integrations. this is the main shortcoming of the functional form (3.8):

in

general there are a countable innity of solutions and it is a dicult task to discover the true

solution with minimum action.

there is one more phase transition in the matrix chain as m2 decreases further. from (5.12)
we see that as m2  1 all eigenvalues of the hessian at the origin become negative and this
stationary point is degenerate in all directions. on the surface, besides this observation of

an irrelevant stationary point, there is little change in the system. the relevant stationary

points are found by solving polynomial equations and their stability is determined locally as
a smooth function of m2. this is misleading though since m2 = 1 corresponds to a lattice
spacing of unity which, in our scaling, is where a kosterlitz-thouless phase transition was

shown to occur [13, 15, 16]. the only overt sign of the transition here is that the integral

kernel k again changes analytic structure to

k(x, u) =

1
4

e

(x+u)2

4  x4+u4

4

(5.21)

near the origin it has an unusual form.

if we consider the higher, quartic terms to only

make the kernel well-dened, the behaviour of the eigenvalue distribution 0 can be found by
restricting the range of integration in the integral equation (3.4)

e i

2r x

d kt () =

1

4 z b

b

(x+u)2

4

du e

e i

2r u

d kt ()

(5.22)

in this form it is clear that the solution will depend only on the constant b which sets a scale
[16], otherwise it is a universal quantity. unfortunately the asymptotic (  0) solutions of
this equation are not known and so remains the eigenvalue distribution kt of the matrix
chain at the kosterlitz-thouless transition.

finally, for m2 < 1 there persists a pair of zz2 related stationary points that at u and x
vanishing trade o relevance. it is conjectured that this non-analytic behaviour is what one

15

would nd in a d = 0 single matrix model, i.e.

0  |x|2

(5.23)

it would see that the same mechanism which produced the critical exponents of matrix quan-
tum mechanics for 1 < m2 < 1 produces dierent exponents here. this may be because of
the total degeneracy of the origin but explicit calculations of the iterated kernels (5.9) and the

eigenvalue distribution 0 are needed to make denite statements about the characteristics of
the solutions of this phase of the model.

6 conclusions and an application

to review, we have demonstrated a general technique for expressing the equations of motion

for systems whose time evolution is governed by das-jevicki-sakita hamiltonians with bound-

ary conditions as an evolution problem in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. specifying

to the particular example of the one-dimensional chain of interacting hermitean matrices we

showed that in this case the general formalism reduces to a linear integral equation for the

large-n eigenvalue density of the matrices. analyzing the associated integral kernel we were

able to recover all previous explicit solutions of the matrix chain from asymptotic solution

of particular second order ordinary dierential equations. in the general case, the solution

of the integral equation was developed in terms of iterations of the kernel and from this

solution the critical behavior of the system was found and a universal integral equation for

the distribution of eigenvalues at the kosterlitz-thouless point was presented. in addition it

was demonstrated that the sub-leading critical behaviour observed in [16] results from con-

tributions from unstable stationary points in saddle-point approximations and hence is not

observed.

what was not accomplished here is the explicit calculation of a non-trivial solution to the

large-n matrix chain using the formalism developed here. it would be nice to nd a potential

for which the series of iterated kernels could be explicitly calculated and summed and the

eigenvalue distribution extracted. this is of particular interest in testing the conjectures

involving the existence of a kosterlitz-thouless phase transition in the system. with a global

solution for kt one would be in a position to calculate explicitly the free energy of the matrix
chain and check the critical behaviour. of course only the critical part of the free energy is

required but in order to obtain this one should have a denite idea of the analytic structure

of the distribution of eigenvalues.

the calculations we have performed here are not only relevant to string theory in one

16

dimension but also for other problems related to the matrix chain. an example is the kazakov-

migdal lattice model of induced qcd in d-dimensions [7]. devised as a lattice model of gauge

interactions where the self-interaction of adjoint scalar elds x are supposed to induce the
standard wilson term which is left out, it is dened by the following action

skm = xx

trv (x)  xhxyi

trxyyyxx

(6.1)

here the sub-scripts label sites on a hyper-cubic lattice on which the n  n adjoint scalar
elds x reside. nearest neighbour interactions are mediated by su(n) elds  residing on
the lattice links. from the large n saddle-point equations it can be shown [10] that the

one-dimensional matrix chain we have considered (3.1), with potential u, is equivalent to the

kazakov-migdal model with a potential satisfying

v (x) = du (x)  2(d  1)zdz

0(z)
x  z

(6.2)

where the eigenvalue density 0 is common to both models.

the one drawback of this model of induced qcd is that the action (6.1) has a zzn
symmetry under the center of the gauge group which leads to super-connement of colour-

electric ux, even on the lattice scale [27]. obviously this not a feature that one would like

to have in the continuum limit of the model and the easiest way to avoid it is for the system

not to realize this symmetry faithfully in its solution. unfortunately for the potentials u of

logarithmic form, for which we have 0 explicitly (see section four), this symmetry persists
[21, 28].
it would be interesting to see if solutions of the matrix chain for more general

potentials might lead to non-trivial propagation of gauge elds in the continuum limit of the

kazakov-migdal model. this can be checked in principle using the solution of the matrix

chain for the eigenvalue density 0 and the formalisms of [29] and [30] which express the
correlation of gauge elds in the model in terms of 0.
