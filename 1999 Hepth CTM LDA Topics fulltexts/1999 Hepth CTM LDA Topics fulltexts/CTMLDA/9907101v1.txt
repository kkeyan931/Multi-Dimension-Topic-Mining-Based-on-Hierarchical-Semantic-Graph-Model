abstract

by assuming the existence of a novel multipronged string state for d-particles interact-

ing with d-brane intersections in type iia string theory, we are able to derive a quantum

mechanical description of supersymmetric reissner-nordstrom black holes. a supersym-

metric index calculation provides evidence for this conjecture. the quantum mechanical

system becomes two decoupled conformal quantum mechanical systems in the low energy

limit. the conformal quantum mechanics has expected properties of a dual description of
string theory on ads2  s2.

1. introduction

following work describing the near horizon geometry of certain string (m) theory black

holes composed of solitonic branes as the maximally supersymmetric product of anti de
sitter space and a sphere (ads  s) with a conformal theory on the boundary [1], work
that identied certain of the solitonic black holes as dirichlet(d)-branes [2], work deter-

mining the low energy theory of d-branes to be a nonabelian gauge theory [3] known to be

conformal in certain cases, and work showing that calculations of the properties of d-brane

black holes could be performed successfully in the conformal theory for an appropriately

large number of d-branes [4][5]; there was a conjecture [6] that supergravity or string (m)

theory in the near horizon ads geometry of the solitonic (d-) branes was equivalent to

the conformal theory on these branes. further work gave a recipe for comparing the two

theories and provided some evidence for the conjectures validity in the supergravity limit

[7][8]. whether or not all of the interesting aspects of string theory can be reduced to a

eld theory, one can at least derive some useful relations between the two theories following

the above works.

the aim of this paper is to extend the relation to four-dimensional black holes with
a near horizon geometry of ads2  s2. we will show that the two-dimensional conformal
theory descriptions of the onebrane-vebrane black hole [4] and generalizations [9][10][11]

are alternatively described at low energies by a quantum mechanics that becomes conformal

in the very low energy limit. evidence will be presented that this quantum mechanics

contains the degrees of freedom responsible for the ground state entropy of the black holes.

the quantum mechanics will not describe completely the moduli space of the transverse

six-fold, for we will assume that the local geometry of the d-particle is at. a two-

dimensional description [12][4][11] may be better suited for this purpose although one

could further complicate the quantum mechanics. on the other hand, to understand gross

features of the four-dimensional black hole, this quantum mechanics may be a reasonable

approach.

in the course of obtaining the quantum mechanical theory, we will propose

some novel string states occurring at the intersections of d-branes. we hope that this

proposal leads to a better understanding of these intersections. the rules we will develop

are somewhat ad hoc but seem to lead to a sensible description.

the outline of the rest of this paper is as follows. in section two we will review some

macroscopic properties as well as the microscopic eective string formulation of the black

holes to be discussed.

in section three we will present the novel string states that we

1

believe to capture the low energy degrees of freedom of the black holes and a prescription

for obtaining these states from the intersections of d-branes.

in section four we will

calculate the index of supersymmetric ground states [13] of the quantum mechanics in the

simplest theory containing these states. we will extrapolate from this result a conjecture

for the degeneracy of the large number of intersections case. the resulting ground state

entropy will agree with the macroscopic and string formulation predictions. in section ve

we will derive the quantum mechanical system describing the black holes. we will take

the low energy limit and obtain a conformal quantum mechanics. what is interesting here

is that in this limit we appear to have two decoupled supersymmetric conformal quantum

mechanical systems, a coulomb branch with manifest so(3) symmetry and a higgs

branch with a large internal symmetry. however, these two branches are coupled in the

full nonconformal theory. maybe, something similar happens in two dimensions. in section

six we present our conclusions and directions for further research.

2. black holes and eective strings

2.1. review of macroscopic black holes

the four dimensional black holes we will consider in this paper are all extremal and

of the reissner-nordstrom type. the metric takes the following form:

ds2 = (t1t2t3t4)1/2dt2 + (t1t2t3t4)1/2(dr2 + r2d2
2)

(2.1)

where ti = (1 + qi/r)1 and the qi are positive. there are electric and magnetic elds,

the mass of the black hole is

fi = dt  dti + dt 1

i

.

m = pi qi

4gn

(2.2)

(2.3)

with gn the four-dimensional newton constant. for equal charges q the ricci scalar
vanishes and

r r =

4q4

(r + q)4

so there is no singularity in the extremal limit. the extremal entropy is

s =

(q1q2q3q4)1/2

gn

2

.

(2.4)

(2.5)

in the near horizon reissner-nordstrom reduces to ads2  s2 with metric

(q1q2q3q4)1/2

(2.6)

while the metric at innity is at. the ricci scalar of ads2 is r =
(q1q2q3q4)1/2 , and
the cosmological constant is  = 1
2 r while rs 2 = 2s 2 = rads2 . there are numerous
papers that have studied the reissner-nordstrom metric as a solution of string (m) theory.

2

in type iib string theory in a purely threebrane background, the equation to solve is

r = fa1a2a3a4 f a1a2a3a4



(2.7)

where we have distinguished four-dimensional and six-fold indices in an obvious way, and f

is the ve-form eld strength. in the simplest case (a six-torus), one can reverse the signs

of some components of the eld strength while retaining a solution of the low energy eld

theory. some of these reversals will break supersymmetry, and it is interesting to consider

these black holes. we will comment on the consequences of breaking supersymmetry in

this way in the next section.

2.2. d-branes and microscopic strings

the paradigmatic extremal onebrane-vebrane black hole [4] is ve-dimensional with
near horizon geometry ads2 s3. upon compactication on a circle the geometry is again
reissner-nordstrom. this black hole has three charges. in the d-brane approach, these
charges are the number n5 of vebranes wrapped on k3s1, the number n1 of onebranes
wrapped on s1, and the momentum p = n0/r with r the radius of the s1 and n0 an
integer. at low energies there is an eective conformal theory on s1  time with central
charge c = 6n1n5. the momentum n0 corresponds to the eigenvalue of the virasoro
generator l0. the sign of n0 is not crucial here as the theory is left-right symmetric,
but the signs of n1 and n5 are correlated. the entropy has been calculated [4] in the
limit of large charges using the metric of the supergravity solution and alternatively the

asymptotic microscopic formula for the degeneracy [14],

d(n0, c) = exp2r n0c

6

(2.8)

where d is the degeneracy, and the entropy s = lnd = 2q n0c

6 . the two calculations of
the entropy agree. the k3 can be replaced by a t 4 [15][16] with similar results. for the
t 4 case one can choose any combination of signs for the three charges.

3

by a sequence of u-duality operations we can convert the t 4 case to an m theory

conguration. compactify on a circle to four dimensions. perform a t-duality on three
directionsthe newly compactied direction and two directions of t 4 (avoiding the mo-

mentum circle). interchange the m theory circle and the momentum circle. the result is

n1n5 fourbrane intersections on a two-torus and n0 zerobranes. we presumably can play
the same game with k3 using mirror symmetry but the analysis seems more complicated

for this case. in the latter part of this paper we will derive an eective quantum mechanics

for the d-particles at the intersections.

the other prototypical reissner-nordstrom black hole solution of string theory has

been discussed by [9][10] and many others. in type iib string theory the four charges ni
are due to threebranes wrapped on a t 6 so that any two sets (i, j) intersect in a string while

three or four sets intersect in a point. there are therefore six strings along each direction
(t 3
(3)t 3
(4).

(j)) of the six-torus and a total of n1n2n3n4 intersections on t 3

(i)t 3

the supersymmetries which are preserved satisfy the following conditions:

(1)t 3

(2)t 3

11l = l

11r = r
i
0abc = i

(2.9)

where 11 = 01 . . . 10 with a a ten-dimensional cliord algebra matrix, i
0abc =
0abc where a, b, c are the directions on t 6 on which the ni branes are wrapped, l
and r are the two supersymmetries of type iib from left and right movers of the string,
and  = l + ir. the sign of the last relation depends on the sign of ni. the i commute
and satisfy 1234 = 1, and the number of preserved supersymmetries is

n = tr[

1  i1

2

1  i2

2

1  i3

2

1  i4

2

].

(2.10)

thus, n = 4 or n = 0. regardless of the signs, any triple intersection preserves super-

symmetry, and supersymmetry can be broken only on quadruple intersections. since the

nonsupersymmetric case solves the low energy equations of iib with reissner-nordstrom

geometry, one might hope to nd a conformal quantum mechanical dual for the near

horizon geometry. unfortunately, an analysis [17] reveals that the nonsupersymmetric

conguration does not minimize the energy and is expected to be unstable.

by t-dualizing this conguration we obtain n2n3n4 intersections of m theory ve-
branes on an eective string with n1 units of momentum. with the proper normalization of

4

charges, the entropy has been calculated macroscopically (2.5) to be s = 2n1n2n3n4,
and arguments have been given that this result holds microscopically [9][10]. by deforming

the degenerate vebranes into a smooth vebrane, one can use the prescription of [11] to

determine the microscopic entropy. one nds that cl = cr = 6n2n3n4 up to a negligible
correction for large charges, and the entropy agrees with the macroscopic prediction. the

left side is almost entirely bosonic, whereas the right side is supersymmetric. because of

the asymmetry of left and right movers, we can view the nonsupersymmetric instability

associated with the wrong sign momentum as a tachyon. from the type iia perspective

the momentum is equivalent to n1 d-particles whose quantum mechanics we will derive.
we expect that this quantum mechanics will apply to any supersymmetric black hole with

a reissner-nordstrom metric when one ignores corrections based on the transverse six-fold

geometry. the full geometry possibly can be incorporated in this quantum mechanics, but

the analysis is not within the scope of this paper.

3. multistrings at d-brane intersections

in this section we conjecture that the states describing d-particle interactions at the

intersections of d-branes are multipronged strings that attach to the d-particle. in string

theory novel states are sometimes required in special compactications such as the twisted

open strings originally discovered [18] in certain orientifolds. the idea of multipronged

strings (multistrings) previously found an application in type iib string theory to describe

certain bps states [19][20] including states responsible for exceptional gauge symmetries

[21] and nonperturbative states preserving one-quarter of the supersymmetry in n = 4

yang-mills theory [22]. the context in which we are proposing these objects is novel.

the considerations of this section are the most conjectural of this paper as we will not

at this time try to prove the existence of these objects. our main argument for invoking

these states is that they lead to a quantum mechanical description that satises many

requirements of a dual to supersymmetric string theory in the background of a reissner-

nordstrom black hole. a perhaps more prosaic consideration is that an index theory

calculation similar to that of section four was attempted by assuming the presence of

the usual d0-d4 matter at these intersections. not only was the calculation formidably

impossible (for me) but also an upper bound on the integral seemed to be too low. by

contrast, the calculation with these states is a piece of cake and yields the desired result.

the natural assumption is that multistrings are the bound (bps) states of the intersection.

5

let us now describe these states. we assume that n d-branes of the same dimension

d intersect along some locus such that any two d-branes are orthogonal to each other (can

at most intersect in less than d dimensions) and some supersymmetry is preserved. the

bps state that we conjecture has n + 1 prongs, one end on a d-particle and one end on

each of the n branes. our assumption is that there is always such a string carrying charge

|q| = 1 under the u (1) gauge group of the d-particle. by symmetry each of the n d-branes

must contribute |q| = 1/n to this charge. such a string will have at least three prongs (the

case n = 1 is the usual case) and break the supersymmetry from 32 to no more than 4

supercharges. we then assume that other states for n  3 can be obtained by reversing

the orientations of an even number of the n strings attached to the n dierent branes.

we show these states for n = 2 and n = 3 in gure one. if the string entering the

d-particle carries no charge, the state can be deformed to one that does not interact with

the d-particle and should not be considered in the quantum mechanics. although we have

drawn the strings with nite size for clarity, these states are massless and can shrink to

a point as appropriate for low energy modes of the quantum mechanics. we assume that

the rule requiring the number of orientation changes to be even is related to the fact (2.10)

that supersymmetry is broken for an odd number of brane orientation changes for n  3.

here we are xing the d-particle orientation.

when the intersection of pairs of d-branes has dimension greater than zero, we assume

that there is a multistring at the intersection with ends on each of these intersections
such that |q| = 2. again we can change an even number of the
(n2)!2! orientations to

n!

obtain other states as shown in gure two for n = 3. we can iterate this process to

higher intersections which are possibly signicant for compactications to less than four

dimensions, but in four dimensions the process ends with pairs. our main consideration

here is that the minimal set of objects required by symmetry between the branes is invoked.

we now come to a crucial distinction between the n = 2 and n  3 cases. for n  3
there are no possible bps states of nite size. for the state to be bps, forces on the

string must vanish at the points of contact with the branes and at the junction. the rst

requirement ensures that the string is orthogonal to the brane. the second requirement

places a restriction that the conguration be planar. these requirements cannot be met
for n  3. the n = 2 case corresponds to two fourbranes intersecting along a two-torus.

let the intersection have complex coordinates y2 = y3 = 0. there is a bps deformation
direction obtained by requiring |y2| = |y3|. hence, massive multistrings (of nite size) can
be bps for this case. the mass will be determined by |y2| so there is an extra angle that
decouples in addition to y1. this angle degenerates at the intersection which seems to pose
a problem for the counting of states. we will show in the next section that this apparent

problem does not exist. note that having obtained this result, the bps spectrum of the

d-particle for the u (1) case is almost identical to that for the d0/d4 bound state problem.

the counting of states in the next section will be greatly facilitated by this observation.

our rules give nice results for the counting of states and seem to be logical, but we

cannot rule out a dierent set of states giving equally nice results and being the correct

states. if this turns out to be the case, we are consoled by the fact that the coulomb

branch of the conformal quantum mechanics (to be derived in section ve) should be

unchanged. it will be interesting to see whether one can put the existence of these multi-

pronged iia strings at brane intersections on a rmer footing (perhaps by relating them

to m theory membranes ending on vebranes).

4. bound states at threshhold and counting of microscopic bps states

in this section we will calculate the index of supersymmetric ground states in the

simplest versions of the theories we have postulated in the previous section. our result will

provide evidence for the formulas we will conjecture for the general case. the calculation

will involve bound states at threshhold, and some of the previous relevant work includes

[13], [23-32]. our calculations will be very similar to the one given in [26].

4.1. setting up the calculation

we will study the case of one d-particle interacting with one intersection of fourbranes

having n = 2 or n = 3. by our proposal of section three, this theory is a quantum mechanics

with four supercharges which can be obtained from the dimensional reduction of the n = 1

yang-mills theory in four dimensions. the formulas of [33] are particularly useful in this

regard. let us rst deal with the n = 2 case. this theory is a u (1) gauge theory with
two chiral multiplets having charge q = 1. there is also an uncharged chiral multiplet
that interacts with the charged multiplets via a superpotential. additionally, there are

some decoupled degrees of freedom. in calculating the index the gauge coupling constant

e can be set to any nonzero value as it scales out of the index calculation we will follow

9

[26] and set e = 2 in the lagrangian of [33]. the lagrangian also depends on another

coupling constant g for the superpotential term. unlike the case of [26] we are considering

the dimensional reduction of an n = 1 not n = 2 theory so the value of g is not set by

supersymmetry. nevertheless, the calculation of the index cannot depend on this value so
long as it is nonzero, and the calculation is simplest when we choose g = 2 as in the
n = 2 case. we have argued in section three that g should be nonzero. with these choices

the hamiltonian takes the following form after replacing the nondynamical variables d

and f [33] by the values that solve their equations of motion.

where the momenta are pi = l xi , etc. , xi are the spatial components in the reduction of the
four-dimensional gauge elds, i are the usual pauli matrices, t = i2, y is the complex
scalar in the neutral chiral multiplet, q are the complex scalars in the charged chiral
multiplets with charges q = 1, and cb, cf are the bosonic and fermionic constraints
generating gauge rotations ( la0
= cb + cf ). we have used  as hermitian conjugate or
complex conjugate depending on the context, and we have chosen the gauge a0 = 0. the
complex two-component fermions l, m+, m, n satisfy the anticommutation relations,

{l, l} = .

(4.5)

next let us consider the n = 3 case. this theory is a u (1) gauge theory with three
chiral multiplets of charge + 1
3 , one with charge 1, and one having
charge 2. a priori we have the possibility of a superpotential coupling together three
chiral multiplets of u (1) charges 1
3 , and 1. this superpotential could lift some or all
of the at directions of the higgs branch. we will assume here that the superpotential

3 , three with charge + 2

3 , 2

is absent. one reason is that the coupling together of these charges presumably can be

10

deformed into an object not localized at the intersection. another reason is that the

index calculation becomes extremely dicult with a superpotential. actually, we will have

more to say about a superpotential when we discuss the index calculation. once we have

turned o the superpotential, we are guaranteed by supersymmetry in four dimensions

that there will be no perturbative or nonperturbative (for the u(1) case) corrections. in

the quantum mechanics holomorphy should also ensure that this coupling remains zero.

the hamiltonian and constraints for the n = 3 case then are

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

we now outline the index calculation. following [13] the goal is to calculate the

partition function twisted by (1)f ,

i = lim


i() = lim


t r(1)f eh = nb  nf ,

(4.13)

which computes the number of bosons minus the number of fermions where f is fermion

number, and the sum is only over gauge invariant states. if the spectrum were discrete,

11

there would be no dependence on . when there is a continuous spectrum above the

ground state, the density of bosonic and fermionic states can dier and depend on . the

usual procedure is to calculate the index as a sum of two terms, i = i(0) + i where

i = z 

0

d
d

i().

(4.14)

the partition function can be constructed perturbatively in powers of  so that the   0
limit is easily taken. the boundary correction i is more subtle. the bosonic potential

has noncompact (at) directions along which this potential vanishes. near these directions

the hamiltonian is a supersymmetric harmonic oscillator in the transverse directions. the

frequency of the oscillator increases linearly with distance from the origin along a at

direction, but the ground state energy of the supersymmetric oscillator vanishes. one

can therefore have nite energy scattering states along these directions so that the index

depends on , and there is a possible correction i.

one includes a projection onto gauge invariant states ru(1) deic where c = cb +cf

so that i() becomes [26]

i() = zu(1)

dz dxhx|treic(1)f eh|xi = zu(1)

dz dxhgx|tr(g)(1)f eh|xi

(4.15)
where x denotes the totality of scalar elds, g() is a gauge transformation, (g) = eicf ,

and the volume of u (1) is normalized to unity. then one obtains

i = lim

0zu(1)

dz dxhgx|tr(g)(1)f eh|xi + i.

(4.16)

it has been shown [26] that the correction or boundary term of the index takes the form

i = lim

rz|~x|=r

r zu(1)

tri(1)f qh1(g)|xi

(4.17)

where h1, the inverse of the hamiltonian, is dened to be zero on the kernel of h, i

is the fermion coecient of the derivative term in the supercharge q, and ~x is the at

direction with boundary ~x = r. we will not attempt to rigorously prove that this term

vanishes for the cases considered here but instead will present a couple of arguments for

its vanishing.

12

4.2. the calculation

the calculation of the index for the n = 2 case is identical to that presented in [26], and

we will not belabor the details. there it was established that the index of supersymmetric

ground states is one for the one-dimensional u (1) gauge theory. there are also some zero

energy modes decoupled from the gauge theory. these include modes associated with

the two directions on the intersection of fourbranes and the zero mode angle discussed

in section three. we obtain a total of four fermionic states and four bosonic states for

each supersymmetric ground state of the gauge theory. we need to make sure that the

degeneracy of the angle at the intersection does not mess up the counting. by cutting o

the lower bound on the y integration at , we can see that there is a vanishing contribution
to the principal index (i(0)) from the intersection. (there are no inverse powers of |q|2
in the integral over the charged scalars in the correction of order  to this cuto.) we have

also taken y to be noncompact to simplify the index calculation.

there are a couple of new details in the n = 3 calculation. fermions from the con-
straint cf are necessary to saturate the fermion zero modes in (1)f . we nd it convenient
to consider cf as the zeroth component of the   x term in hf . the integrand in the xi
and  integrations is then a function of r2 = xixi + 2. we have derived the following gen-
eral formula in a u (1) quantum mechanical theory without extra scalars or superpotential

terms,

i(0) = xi

ni
2qi

.

(4.18)

here, ni indicates the number of charged multiplets with charge qi. for the n = 3 case
we see that i(0) = 6. given that the principal contribution is integral, we do not expect
a boundary contribution. there are two at directions, qm = 0 all m or xi = 0 and

pm qmqmqm = 0. an intuitive argument for ignoring the coulomb boundary term

is that the charged multiplets become very heavy along this direction leaving a free u (1)

theory. unlike the case of [27][28] we are not starting from a nonabelian theory so there

is no left over weyl invariance, and the boundary term should be [27] the negative of the

principal term for u (1) which vanishes. noticing that i(0) is in many cases fractional, we

suspect that the higgs boundary term will often play a role.

we will follow somewhat the analysis presented in [28] to determine the asymptotic

hamiltonian in the at directions for the ground state of the massive modes. to this

level of approximation, we will show that the boundary term vanishes. thus, we will not

prove that the total index is i(0).

13

let us look at the coulomb direction. by a unitary transformation of the mm

fermions we can write the rst term of hf as

rxm

qm(mm1mm1  mm2mm2)

where r = xixi. we decompose the ground state wave function as

16

the correction in this case is denitely nonzero. there appears to be neither a sym-

metry argument for the vanishing of the boundary term nor for its being integral. since

the index should be integral, one possible argument for its vanishing is as follows. suppose

we introduce a superpotential with innitesimal gauge invariant cubic and quartic cou-

plings. including the d term there are enough constraints on the eight chiral multiplets

to lift all of the at directions so that the higgs branch is massive and introduces no

boundary correction. does this superpotential change the principal index? since these

couplings only multiply the superpotential terms, we cannot do a universal rescaling to

make them large. these couplings have the dimension of mass to some power and are
negligible in the high temperature (  0) limit. also, the limit that the couplings vanish
does not produce a singularity in the principal index calculation. in conclusion, we argue

that our calculation of the principal index is exact and has no boundary correction from

the coulomb or higgs branch.

4.3. counting bps states

in the last section we have calculated the index of supersymmetric ground states in

the simplest examples of the n = 2 and n = 3 theories. we will now use this result

along with some plausible assumptions to count the bps ground states and determine the

entropy. our rst assumption is that the index actually counts the ground states in these

theories. in any case it counts states that will remain massless under smooth deformations

of the theory. the degeneracy of states will be bounded from below by the degeneracies

determined from the index. we have seen in section two that the reissner-nordstrom

metric is asymptotically at. at large distances from the intersections, the d-particles

experience at ten-dimensional spacetime. we therefore assume that there is a unique

bound state of n d-particles for every n (as has apparently been shown as an index [32]).

our nal assumption is that the d-particles and their bound states can interact with any

of the n1n5 intersections for n = 2 or n2n3n4 intersections for n = 3 to form the same
number of bound states that we have obtained in the one intersection case.

the n = 2 index calculation indicates that there are four massless bosonic modes and

four massless fermionic modes for a d-particle interacting with one intersection. with the

above assumptions we write down the following generating function for the degeneracy of

n0 d-particles interacting with n1n5 intersections,

z = yn

(1 + qn)4n1n5
(1  qn)4n1n5

= xn0

d(n0)qn0.

(4.38)

17

in the above product n indexes the number of d-particles that are bound together. this
formula is exactly the result obtained from the onebrane-vebrane system in previous

calculations [4][15][16].

the n = 3 calculation reveals six massless bosonic modes for a d-particle interacting
with one intersection. using our assumptions we determine the generating formula for the
degeneracy of n1 d-particles interacting with n2n3n4 intersections to be

z = yn

(1  qn)6n2n3n4 = xn1

d(n1)qn1 .

(4.39)

again, we have the previously determined result [9][10][11]. now that we have a little
condence in our theories, we will see in the next section what they imply for the quantum

mechanics of four-dimensional black holes.

5. the quantum mechanical system

5.1. generalities

let us rst write down lagrangians for the n = 2 and n = 3 theories following from

dimensional reduction of four-dimensional theories [33].

for the n = 2 case we will again assume the superpotential is that given by n = 2

supersymmetry in four dimensions (although this is not essential). we denote neutral
t a and charged scalars by a, a, b,
scalars in the adjoint of u (n0) by z = za
and b where the rst (gauge) index runs from 1 to n0, the second has n1 values, and
the third n5 values. we single out the three components of the four-dimensional gauge
eld in the dimensional reduction as xi. the superpartners of the chiral scalars are a and
b while those of the neutral scalars are l and n . our hermitian generators (t a)

of u (n0) satisfy [t a, t b] = if abct c and tr(t at b) = 1
constants of su (n0) ((t n0)

2 ab where f abc are the structure

).



 = 12n0

the lagrangian is written as follows in the a0 = 0 gauge.

where y, y are the components of z transverse to xi, and we have suppressed most of the

indices. the a and  indices should be summed over.

 and hermitian conjugates where the rst

where the qm, qn have been previously given in section four. we have written these

lagrangians in gory detail for future reference though fermions will be ignored for the rest

of this paper. our analysis from this point will concentrate on the n = 3 case with some

relevant comments about the n = 2 case.

5.2. reduction to a conformal quantum mechanics

we will generalize the methods used by [34] for reducing a matrix model to a multidi-

mensional calogero type model [35]. rewriting the bosonic part of the n = 3 lagrangian

with some lagrange multipliers gives the following result,

where again most of the indices are suppressed. integrating out the s gives the bosonic

part of the previous lagrangian (5.2).

note that g2 has the dimension of (mass)3. the low energy limit corresponds to ignoring
the terms of l

g2 . doing this, we are left with some constraints.

(5.7)

(5.8)

(5.9)

the coulomb branch corresponds to setting all the qm and rn to zero, whereas the
higgs branch corresponds to setting xi and the d constraints (5.9) to zero.

5.3. the coulomb branch

the bosonic lagrangian on the coulomb branch is

lc = tr{ x2

i + i(1)

ij [xi, xj]}.

(5.10)

we follow [34] in deriving a three-dimensional spin-calogero model. due to the global

u (n1) symmetry, there is a conserved matrix,

k = ixi

[xi, xi].

(5.11)

using the constraint (5.7) to diagonalize the xi by a time dependent unitary matrix u ,
one obtains

lc =

1
2

n1

xa=1

2

~qa

xa6=b

kab kba
|~qa  ~qb|2

(5.12)

where k = u ku1 and the ~qa are eigenvalues of ~x.

20

in general kab kba will be time dependent. if we take the zero mode part of kab kba,

we obtain a model invariant under the conformal symmetry sl(2, r) with action

t =

t + 
t + 
a(t) = qi
qi
   = 1

a(t)(t + )1

.

(5.13)

we expect but have not veried that restricting kab kba to some function of ( d
dt|~qa 
~qb|)2|~qa  ~qb|2 will lead to a conformally invariant model. this model also has an so(3)
symmetry (or su (2) if one includes fermions). the symmetry of ads2  s2 is sl(2, r)
so(3). since g  ()3/2 where the string tension is (2)1, the near horizon   0
limit in the supergravity corresponds to the g   limit that we have taken to derive this
theory. the limit that the number of particles goes to innity or that the supergravity is
valid should correspond to taking the zero mode part of kab kba. in this case there is an
added bonus that we can remove one particle far from the others (|~q1|  |~qa|, a > 1) and
obtain a one particle calogero model,

l1 =

1
2| ~q1|2 +

l2  2pb6=1( k1b kb1)0

2|~q1|2

+ l(~qa, ~qa)a>1

(5.14)

where l2 is the angular momentum operator for s2. this result has previously been
obtained by considering a charged particle in the supergravity background of ads2  s2
[36]. the higher order terms in kab kba could possibly be determined from the generalized
conformal mechanics of one particle in that paper. there is also a derivation of the three-

dimensional calogero model [34] based on assuming a special form for the matrix k. that

model is automatically conformally invariant. we, however, see no reason for assuming
that special form. the n = 2 case diers from the n = 3 case by extra global u (1)2
symmetry. this symmetry originates from the extra bps deformation directions for the

n = 2 multistrings.

5.4. the higgs branch

the bosonic lagrangian on the higgs branch is

lh = qm qm + rn rn xm

qm qm(3)qm xn

qnrn(3) rn

(5.15)

21

where the d constraint is enforced by (3). if (3) were time independent, this system
would be a simple harmonic oscillator. one can see that (3) has the dimension of (mass)2.
for this lagrangian to be conformally invariant, we require that (3) transforms as

(3) = (t + )4(3).

(5.16)

if we redene the chiral multiplets by a time dependent unitary matrix that diagonalizes
(3), we have an interpretation of the square roots of the n1 eigenvalues as time dependent
inverse scale sizes of the n1 d-particles in the transverse dimensions. in the g   limit
the coulomb and higgs branches appear to be decoupled from each other. at higher

energies the two branches are coupled through the harmonic oscillator modes that have

been ignored in the conformal limit.

6. discussion

we have conjectured that d-particles at d-brane intersections form multistrings and

that these multistrings are the relevant degrees of freedom of black holes formed from these

intersections. an index calculation shows that the counting of states is correct for one d-

particle interacting with one intersection. with several assumptions, one sees that these

multistrings can account for the ground state entropy of the black hole. we have derived

from the multistring theory a conformal quantum mechanics, the coulomb branch, that
exhibits expected properties of string theory on ads2  s2. we have also derived another
conformal quantum mechanics, the higgs branch, that describes the moduli space of

d-particled-intersections. these two theories are coupled at higher energies.

it would be interesting to see whether one could reproduce the bps spectrum of string
theory on ads2  s2 [37] from the conformal mechanics. the symmetries are certainly the
same. it would also be interesting to compare correlation functions in the two theories.

an even more interesting project would be to see whether the full quantum mechanics

describes the dynamics of the nonextremal reissner-nordstrom black hole.
