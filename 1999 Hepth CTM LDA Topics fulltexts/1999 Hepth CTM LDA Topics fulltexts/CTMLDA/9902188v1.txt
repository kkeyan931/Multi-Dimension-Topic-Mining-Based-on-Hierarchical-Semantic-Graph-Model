abstract

using the low energy eective action of the n = 2 supersymmetric su(2) yangmills

theory we calculate the free energy, , at nite temperature, both in the semiclassical

region and in the dual monopole/dyon theory.

in all regions  depends on both the

temperature t and the appropriate moduli parameter, and is thus minimized only for

specic values of the moduli parameter, in contrast to the t = 0 case where the energy

vanishes all over the moduli space. within the validity of perturbation theory, we nd

that the nite temperature yangmills theory is stable only at denite points in the

moduli space, i.e. for a specic value of the monopole/dyon mass or when the scalar eld

expectation value goes to innity.

1. introduction

in the last few years, our knowledge about the behavior of supersymmetric nonabelian

gauge theories has increased dramatically, both for n = 1 and n = 2 supersymmetry

(susy) [1, 2]. one of the main achievements has been the derivation of the low energy

dynamics, expressed in terms of a dierent, but equivalent, theory. under certain circum-

stances this makes it possible to describe the original strongly coupled theory by a dual,

weakly coupled theory and provides a natural generalization of diracs electricmagnetic

duality.

the classical n = 2 su(2) gauge theory has a continuos manifold of inequivalent

ground states. this classical moduli space is parametrized by the gauge invariant quan-
tity u = tr2  a2, and for a 6= 0 the original gauge symmetry is broken down to u(1).
although there are no quantum corrections that lift the degeneracy among the ground

states, the quantum theory is still quite dierent from the classical one. at large ex-

pectation values the theory is weakly coupled due to asymptotic freedom, and the low

energy degrees of freedom are just the massless excitations of the microscopic theory.

naively, one would expect an enhancement of massless elds at a = 0, where the full

symmetry is restored. however, in the quantum theory a 6= 0 all over the moduli space,
and thus the symmetry group is never enlarged. instead there exist points where mas-

sive monopoles/dyons become massless [2]. thus, at dierent points in moduli space it

becomes necessary to use dierent theories to describe the low energy properties.

duality in this context is not a symmetry of the theory but rather a way to describe the

dynamics at a strong electrical coupling in terms of e.g. a weakly interacting, magnetically

charged theory, where the monopole appears as a fundamental particle.

although the n = 2 su(2) gauge theory is not directly relevant for phenomenological

studies, it provides a valuable theoretical framework where nontrivial issues can be tested;

in that respect the supersymmetric theory is worthwhile to study and use as a toy model.

for example, being an asymptotically free, fourdimensional nonabelian gauge theory,

several of its fundamental properties, such as connement via condensation of magnetic

2

monopoles [2] and chiral symmetry breaking [4], are also found in qcd.

another interesting aspect of eld theories (including supersymmetric ones), is their

decisive role in determining the evolution of the early universe, that is their behavior at

nite temperature. previous studies of the nite temperature eects in susy theories

have focused on e.g. certain fermion condensates in the nonlinear susy model [5]

and symmetry nonrestoration eects in softly broken susy theories at high tempera-

ture [6]. apart from being interesting in its own right, it is not inconceivable that the

study of supersymmetric theories at nite temperature could provide additional qualita-

tive information of a more general nature. therefore, it is of interest to study also the

nite temperature eects on supersymmetric theories. more specically, since the n = 2

susy yangmills theory has a very rich and complicated structure at t = 0, that never-

theless is rather well understood, one could hope that this theory provides some nontrivial

information at nite t as well.

at nite temperature, several properties of a theory may change dramatically from the

t = 0 case. in particular, a preferred nontrivial minimum of the eective potential can

be altered as the temperature is raised. in ordinary, nonsupersymmetric gauge theories

this is a well known feature, and in e.g. the electroweak standard model the su(2) 
u(1) symmetry is believed to be restored at a critical temperature tc  200 gev [7]. in
the n = 2 su(2) yangmills theory, the existence of a manifold of ground states depends

crucially on a delicate balance between the perturbative eects from fermions and bosons,

as expressed in the nonrenormalization theorem [8]. however, at nite temperature

the bosons obey boseeinstein statistics whereas fermions obey fermidirac statistics.

thus, the cancellations due to supersymmetry do not in general apply to the temperature

dependent parts and one can not a priori expect the nite t eective potential to remain

unchanged.

as the susy yangmills theory is asymptotically free, one would expect the high

temperature phase to consist of a weakly interacting gas of electrical particles. another,

more interesting prospect is the changes in the atness condition that may occur already

3

at low temperatures. a crucial observation regarding the low temperature eects is that

the atness of the potential is sensitive to any disturbance.

in contrast to most other

theories, e.g. the electroweak standard model, this means that the stable points of the

theory may be altered completely at any temperature t > 0. thus even a very small

heating of the system is capable of driving the theory to some specic minima in the

moduli space. an interesting consequence is that if the temperature initially is very high

and the electric plasma phase is cooled, then eventually the system would be forced

to one of these minima. note that since dierent minima correspond to a completely

dierent behavior at low energy , once a minima is chosen the corresponding dynamics is

xed and persists even at very low temperatures. this paper is devoted to a study of the

existence of such low temperature minima.

to study the low temperature eects on the theory, we will use the low energy eec-

tive action and calculate the free energy perturbatively. to be able to trust perturbation

theory the omitted corrections of course have to be small. imposing this condition we

will calculate the free energy both in the semiclassical region (large |a|) where the original
electric coupling is small, and in the vicinity of the points at which the monopole/dyon

becomes massless, where the dual magnetic coupling is small. at a given low tempera-

ture, the free energy is then minimized with respect to the appropriate moduli parameter

and the stable points can be determined.

the paper is organized as follows.

in the next section we recall some of the main

results obtained for the low energy n = 2 susy su(2) yangmills theory. section 3

is devoted to a calculation of the free energy in the semiclassical region and in section

4 we analyze the thermal eects in terms of the dual variables, around the monopole

singularity. our conclusions and comments on the results are given in section 5, while

our conventions and some technical details are referred to the appendix.

2. n = 2 susy su(2) yangmills theory at low energy and t = 0

in this section we set up the model and recapitulate the main results at zero temper-

4

ature [2]. for a comprehensive review, see e.g. [9, 10, 11].

the n = 2 susy su(2) yangmills theory without matter elds consists of a chiral

n = 2 eld fullling a reality condition [12]. in the n = 1 superspace formulation, the

action can be written as,

sym =

1
4

imtrz d4x  (cid:20)z d2 w w + 2z d2d2 e2v (cid:21) ,

(2.1)

where w  is a vector multiplet containing a vector boson a and a weyl fermion , and

the chiral multiplet  contains a complex scalar  and a weyl fermion . the trace is

taken over the internal gauge indices, with all elds in the adjoint representation and

the generators normalized according to tr(t at b) = ab/2. the function  is given by a

combination of the coupling constant g and the thetaangle ,

 =


2

+

4i
g2

.

(2.2)

this theory is asymptotically free, and at the level of perturbation theory the function

is determined completely by the oneloop contribution [8, 13],

(g) = 

1
42 g3 .

(2.3)

as in qcd, dimensional transmutation takes place and introduces a scale parameter 

that governs where the coupling becomes strong.

writing the classical action (2.1) in components and eliminating the auxiliary elds,

the action sym contains a potential for the scalar elds,

v (, ) =

1

2g2 tr(cid:16)[, ]2(cid:17) .

(2.4)

this quartic potential is obviously nonnegative and is minimized when  and  com-

mute. up to a gauge transformation we can take

 =

a
2

3 ,

(2.5)

with a an arbitrary complex constant and 3 the usual pauli matrix. the gauge invariant

quantity that labels the set of inequivalent vacua, the moduli space, in the quantum

5

theory is given by

u = dtr(2)e .

(2.6)

for a 6= 0 a superhiggs phenomenon takes place and the su(2) symmetry is broken
down to u(1), whereas the n = 2 supersymmetry is still maintained.

now consider the low energy part of the spontaneously broken theory, valid for energies

e  . when |a|  , the theory is weakly coupled and the massive particles are very
heavy compared to the scale e. as a result, to lowest (zeroth) order in a1 the massive

particles can be neglected and the low energy eective action simply consists of a free

massless abelian theory, sitting in a single n = 2 chiral multiplet. eective interactions

between the massless particles are suppressed by powers of a and appear when the eects

of the heavy modes are taken into account. actually, all terms up to two derivatives or

at most four fermions can be determined completely (for a proper way of counting in a

momentum expansion of a supersymmetric theory, see [14]). in the n = 1 formalism, the

most general u(1) gauge invariant eective action up to two derivatives, and compatible

with n = 2 supersymmetry is,

se = im

(cid:21) ,

(2.7)

where f () is the so called prepotential and f  = f/, f  = 2f/2. the unknown

function f () is then xed uniquely at the perturbative level by combining the non

renormalization theorem [8] and the requirement that the eective lagrangian reects

the u(1)r anomaly. together with the nonperturbative instanton corrections, this gives

f () =

(2.8)

where cn are coecients that can be determined from the exact treatment of the problem

[2, 15] or by direct instanton calculations [16].

having derived the low energy action in the large |a| region, one now has to nd a
description involving the correct massless elds that is valid when the coupling becomes

strong. in the classical theory, the point a = 0 corresponds to an enhancement of the

6

symmetry, u(1)  su(2), and all the elds become massless. in the quantum theory,
a single point where extra massless elds appear is not admissible, because in that case

a2 would be a global parametrization of the moduli space, which it cannot be [2]. con-

sequently, there has to be at least two singularities at u 6= 0 where additional particles
become massless. moreover, the appearance of massive vector bosons becoming massless

at certain points leads to a conformally invariant theory in the infrared limit, which con-

tradicts u 6= 0. therefore, seiberg and witten [2] conjectured that there should be exactly
two singularities at 2 in the strong coupling region, and that these two points should
correspond to a magnetic monopole (at +2) or a dyon (at 2) becoming massless.
the dyon has electric and magnetic charge (ne, nm) = (1,1), while the charge of the
monopole is (ne, nm) = (0, 1). the correct degrees of freedom in the low energy action
hence include the massless elds that couple locally to the monopole or dyon, together

with the eective interactions that results from integrating out the light soliton. this

conjecture leads to a consistent picture and has been justied further later on (see e.g.

[17]).

the solitons that become massless at 2 exist already at the semiclassical level, since
the original spontaneously broken su(2) theory admits soliton solutions. these solitons

fall into a short multiplet and their mass is given by the bpscondition,

m = 2 |z| ,

(2.9)

where z is the central charge of the supersymmetry algebra. now, since the relation

between the central charge and the mass is protected from quantum eects, the mass

formula (2.9) remains valid even in the full quantum theory. the central charge can be

calculated explicitly [18], with a resulting mass formula for the bps states,

m = 2 |ane + adnm| .

(2.10)

here ad = f/a is the variable dual to a. in other words, the dual theory in the vicinity

of u = +2 is a magnetic version of n = 2 qed, where the light monopole has a mass

mm = 2|ad| and couples to the dual photon. when u  2 we have ad  0 and the

7

monopole becomes massless. the other singularity, where the dyon becomes massless,

is related to the rst by a discrete z2 symmetry that originates from a nonanomalous
subgroup of u(1)r. at the point u = 2 the dyons are massless, corresponding to
(a  ad)  0.

integrating out the monopoles, the resulting eective theory is reminiscent of (2.7),

but in terms of the dual elds w 

d and d. given the function for n = 2 susy qed,

3. the free energy in the semiclassical region

in this section we will calculate the free energy for large |a|, based on the low energy

eective action.

as has already been noted, for |a|   the eective action at energy scales e  
contains only the remaining massless elds. these elds are not charged with respect

to the unbroken u(1) and are thus free to rst order. all possible interactions between

the massless elds can be expanded in local, eective vertices and the interactions are

suppressed by powers of the masses of the heavy particles, which are proportional to

|a|. also, the coupling constant is small due to asymptotic freedom which suppresses the
higher order terms further, albeit only logarithmically.

if the temperature is low, i.e. t  |a|, the probability of having a real massive
particle in the heat bath is suppressed by the boltzmann factor e|a|/t  1. hence
we can safely neglect the thermally excited massive particles, and need only to take into

account the exchange of virtual, massive particles between the massless and otherwise free

ones. therefore, the dominating contributions to the free energy come from the massless

8

particles and their eective interactions. furthermore, when the temperature is low we

do not expect any large logarithms involving the temperature, so g = g(|a|)  1.

the component form of the eective action can be obtained from equation (2.7) in a

straightforward manner. eliminating the auxiliary elds and including all vertices that
contribute to the free energy up to |a|2, the action is given by,

where the fermions ,  have been written as fourcomponent majorana spinors,  is a

complex scalar and f is the eld strength for the vector boson, with f the dual of

f. to arrive at the action (3.1) all elds have been rescaled by the common factor g.

finally, the instanton contributions have been neglected, since they are further suppressed

by powers of (/|a|)  1.

since the free energy is a static quantity we will use the imaginary time formulation

and apply by now well established techniques for such nite temperature calculations

[19, 20]. as is well known, at nite temperature t , the euclidean space is restricted to
~x  3, 0  x4   = t 1 and the bosonic (fermionic) elds are periodic (antiperiodic)
under x4  x4 + .

to rst order, we have a gas of free, massless particles and the corresponding contri-

9

bution to the free energy density  is just the blackbody radiation,

(1) =

.

(3.2)

at two loops, there are several terms of order |a|2 in equation (3.1) that could con-
tribute. however, it is easily seen that apart from the vertices proportional to either
(/a) or (/a), the order |a|2 loops from all the other terms vanish trivially, since the
remaining integrands are either odd or contain an odd number of matrices. concerning

the contribution from the diagrams involving (/a) and (/a), they are all of the form

depicted in fig. 1. since the momentum integrals are ultraviolet divergent, they have

to be regularized. employing a regularization method that respects the supersymmetry,

such as dimensional reduction1 [21, 22], and using the method outlined in [23] to factorize

the integrals, the result of the derivative interactions can be written in the form,

(3.3)

we have inserted an arbitrary mass parameter  to get the correct dimensions, and the

sum over the matsubara frequencies n, m have been written as contour integrals, with

k0 = in, p0 = im and  = t 1. the second bracket in the free energy (3.3) is due

to the scalar eld, where m = 2mt and in the rst bracket the upper sign holds for

bosons and the lower for fermions, where n = (2n + 1)t . now, in the rst bracket the

rst term vanishes due to the denition of integration in dimensional regularization. in

the second term inside the rst bracket we can close the contour in the right half plane

of the complex k0plane, and since the integrand has no poles there is no contribution

from this term either. as a consequence, the expression in equation (3.3) vanishes and
(2) = 0. thus there are no t 6/|a|2 corrections to the free energy.

1the conclusions below are also true when the dimensional regularization method is used.

fig. 1. nontrivial diagrams in (2), at order |a|2.

expanding the action (2.7) further to include higher orders in |a|1, it is easy to see
that there are no loop corrections to the blackbody radiation that are suppressed by a3.

therefore, the leading correction term to the free part in (3.2) has to be at least of order
o(t 8/|a|4). these terms will also be of order g8 or higher in the coupling constant.

however, the order t 8/|a|4terms do not only originate from an expansion of the eec-
tive action in (2.7). apart from this holomorphic piece, there are also nonholomorphic

contributions that start at the level of fourderivative terms [24, 25, 26]. in the n = 1

superspace formulation the nonholomorphic part of the eective action is [14],

snon.hol.

where all the elds have been rescaled with a factor g, in accordance with conventions

used for the holomorphic action (3.1). the terms of order g6 appear when the lowest

order equations of motion for the auxiliary elds, derived from the holomorphic action

(2.7), are substituted back into the action (3.6). since the lowest order terms in the

nonholomorphic part are of order g4, it is clear that the leading correction terms to the

freeeld result come from equation (3.6), and not from the holomorphic part (3.1).

the contributions to the free energy come from twoloop diagrams of the form shown

in fig. 2, where each loop, independently of the other, is any of the bosons (, a) or

fermions (, ).

(3.7)

as expected, since the physical degrees of freedom for the complex scalar eld and the

vector boson are the same, their contributions are identical. also, the fermions and bosons

obey dierent statistics, and the result of having a fermion loop or a boson loop should

not be equal. however, as is apparent from the terms in (3.7), they all give results that

add up instead of tending to cancel each other, as is the case in susy theories at t = 0.

this additivity of the thermal eects is in accordance with earlier observations on the

nite t behavior of susy theories [27].

(3.8)

since we have found a dependence on both t and |a| in , we can now regard the
temperature as being a xed external parameter and minimize the free energy with respect

to |a|. as is clear from equation (3.8), the free energy decreases as |a| becomes larger, and
since a larger |a| corresponds to a smaller coupling constant, the approximations made
in (3.8) become even better. thus, the prediction from the perturbative calculation is

reliable and the free energy tends towards its minimum value when |a|  . this run
away solution in the semiclassical region is somewhat reminiscent of the superpotential

solution in n = 1 su(nc) yangmills theories with nf (nf < nc) avors [28], although

the origin of the behavior is of course completely dierent. it is a rather interesting result

that the semiclassical region is well dened at t = 0, but tends to an unphysical solution

for any t > 0.

however, it should be stressed that the above conclusion is only trustworthy to the

extent that higher order corrections in g can be neglected, and is strictly speaking only

true in the far asymptotic region. in fact, if the order g6 contribution from (3.6) and the

order g8 correction from the holomorphic part (3.1) are nonzero, and if the numerical

13

coecient in front is large, one can not exclude that the nonasymptotic region has

another behavior, with an additional stable point at large, but nite |a|.

4. the free energy in the dual theory

in this section we will use the dual formulation of the theory and calculate the free

energy around the monopole singularity.

as |a| decreases, the theory moves away from the semiclassical region and the system
becomes strongly coupled. although the condition |a|  t might be fullled, the strong
coupling renders a perturbative calculation in the original electric variables meaningless.

fortunately, the powerful tool of duality provides a mean to perform the calculation in

certain regions of the strong coupling regime. when entering the strong coupling region
the lightest bpsstates consist of the (0, 1) monopoles around u = 2 and the (1,1)
dyons for u  2.

as stated earlier, around the point u = 2 the low energy theory is a magnetic version

of n = 2 qed, where the magnetic monopoles have a mass mm = 2|ad| and become
massless as u  2. the dual coupling constant gd is small as long as the characteristic
energy scale e is small, e  .

restricting the calculation to t  |a| and t   still permits an arbitrary relation
between the temperature and the monopole mass. two extreme limits can be calculated

analytically, namely t  mm and t  mm. in the rst limit monopoles easily become
thermally excited, whereas in the latter one has to use an eective action where the

monopoles have been integrated out.

now, consider rst the case when |ad|  t (and t  |a|, t  ). under these
conditions we are in the weak coupling region, and the heat bath consists of both the

massless n = 2 chiral multiplet (where the dual photon is the vector boson) and the

massive but light n = 2 monopole hypermultiplet. at this temperature the contributions

from any other particles, such the dyons, are neglectable since their mass is proportional

to |a|. thus we are in a high temperature phase with respect to the light degrees of

14

freedom.

using n = 1 superspace, the lagrangian of the theory is,

where m = 2ad. wd, d belong to the n = 2 chiral multiplet and qd, qd to the
hypermultiplet, where qd and qd have opposite gauge quantum numbers. after some

as before, the lowest order contribution to the free energy is just the blackbody ra-

as is clear from equation (4.3), the noninteracting part of the free energy becomes smaller

when mm  0. based only on the part of the free energy displayed in (4.3), one would
conclude that mm = 0 represents a minimum. however, as will be clear, the interaction

eects are not insignicant.

taking into account also the interactions from the lagrangian (4.2), the next contri-

butions to d are twoloop eects, which are suppressed by o(g2

d). using the method

developed in [29, 30], their contributions can be calculated in a power series in (mm/t ).

the total free energy in (4.5) displays some remarkable features. when t  mm

the relevant scale is set by the temperature, so we expect that g2

d = g2

suciently small mm/t ratio, the term proportional to g2

dmmt 3 is comparable to m 2

mt 2.

in other words, the interactions may change the minimum (at mm = 0) found from the

blackbody radiation only. from d in (4.5), the dominant mass dependent contribution

mm in d is

mm =   mm
4 

13g2

dt

24 ! mmt 2 ,

16

(4.6)

and therefore the position of the extremum of the free energy is,

mm =

13g2
dt
12

.

(4.7)

in fact, this point represents the minimum. hence the free energy is minimized when

equation (4.7) is satised, that is when the zero temperature mass is of the same magnitude

as the thermally induced electric mass. by the z2 symmetry this implies a similar result

to be valid in the region where the dyon is the lightest massive particle.

we now turn to the opposite extreme in the dual region, i.e. when mm  t . we
also require mm   to be able to trust the perturbation theory. when the parameters
fulll the above conditions the thermally excited monopoles only contribute with a factor

emm/t . of course, the exponentially small term reects the probability of having real

monopoles in the heat bath. as in the semiclassical region, it is clear that the dominating

eect from the monopoles is due to the virtual exchange of monopoles between the massless

particles, and it is appropriate to use a low energy eective action.

the holomorphic part of the eective action is given by equation (2.7), but in terms

of the dual variables wd, d and with the dual prepotential (2.12). the contribution
from the blackbody radiation to the free energy d is,

(1)
d = 

2t 4
12

.

(4.8)

as in the previous section, we have to include the interactions to incorporate the mass

parameter, in this case |ad|.
contribute to the leading correction terms in the free energy, and this result persists in

in the semiclassical region the holomorphic part did not

the dual theory as well. the reason is simply that the expansion of the dual prepotential is

completely analogous to the case in the semiclassical region, with the expansion parameter
a in the semiclassical region replaced by an  2an
this in turn is a consequence of the fact that the coecient in the function of n = 2

d, except in the coupling constant.

qed diers by a factor 1/2 from the su(2) case, as a comparison between equation
(2.3) and (2.11) shows.

however, just as in the case of ordinary, nonsupersymmetric qed one should expect

higher order interactions coming from an eulerheisenberg type of eective lagrangian

17

[31].

in fact, such a supersymmetric extension was discussed in [25], and corresponds

to nothing but the nonholomorphic contribution to the eective action. in that sense,

the nonholomorphic action in the semiclassical region is the supersymmetric extension

of a nonabelian eulerheisenberg action, whereas for the magnetic monopoles it is an

extension of the abelian case.

as in the holomorphic part, the eective action in the dual region is given by replacing

d in (3.6) (see also [26]). therefore, the lowest order correction to the free

energy, when mm  t , is

(3)
d = 

g4
d2t 8

384|ad|4 + o g6

|ad|4! .

dt 8

(4.9)

the total free energy in the dual region, valid for mm  t is then obtained by combining
equation (4.8) and (4.9),

d =

12 

g4
d2t 8

384|ad|4 + o  g6

(4.10)

minimizing the free energy we thus nd that the theory prefers a smaller mass, a statement

that of course is valid only as long as both mm  t and the omitted higher order
corrections are neglectable. again this result is transferred to the region around the dyon

singularity by the z2 symmetry.

to summarize this section, we have found that when mm  t the free energy becomes
smaller as the mass decreases. when the mass is suciently small, the theory enters a

high temperature region where t  mm. as expected, the mass continues to decrease,
but rather unexpectedly only down to mm  g2
dt . if the mass initially is smaller, it will
increase instead, up to the minimum of the free energy at mm  g2
as in the semiclassical region we can not exclude another minimum in a region where higher

dt . note though, that

orders in the coupling constant become relevant. since the dual coupling increases as the

mass becomes larger, such a minimum could be present when the theory is suciently far

away from u = 2, but still in the regime where the dual theory is well dened.

using the z2symmetry, we also conclude that the same situation as described above

takes place around the singularity at u = 2, where the dyons are light.

18

5. conclusions

we have calculated the free energy in the low energy n = 2 supersymmetric su(2)

yangmills theory, using the low energy eective action description, and would now like

to make some comments and remarks about our results. it should be emphasized that

some of the conclusions are naturally rather speculative at the present stage.

in the semiclassical region where |a|  , we nd that the lowest order correction
terms come from the nonholomorphic part of the eective action, and as a result the free

energy decreases as the moduli parameter |a| increases. the stable point corresponds to
the limit |a|  . using the dual description in the strong coupling regime, we nd that
the theory ows towards a stable point where the monopole mass mm is of the order of
the thermally induced mass, mm  g2
singularity to the region where the dyons become the light solitons, and therefore implies

dt . the discrete z2symmetry relates the monopole

that the monopole results are valid for the dyons as well. thus the scenario depicted in

fig. 3 emerges, where region iii corresponds to the semiclassical region |a|  , and the
two other regions correspond to a neighborhood where the dual theory is valid; region ii

to where the soliton mass ms satises ms  t and region i to t  ms.

dotted lines denote the stable minima.

as mentioned earlier, one can not rule out the existence of other minima, positioned

at large but nite |a| and at a large value of the soliton mass, ms, in the dual theory. in
order to establish whether such minima actually appear, one would have to calculate the

logarithmic corrections coming from higher orders in the coupling constant, but having

19

the same suppression of powers of mass as the dominant eect (i.e.

|a|4 or m 4

s ). at

this stage the presence of such minima can neither be proved, nor excluded.

in the asymptotic region, where the minimum is reached for |a|  , the theory does
not seem to be well dened in the nite temperature case. nevertheless, the large |a|
region could still be meaningful in e.g. a cosmological scenario. this would be attributed

to the fact that ultimately higher energy scales must become important and hence may

provide a stabilization of the theory, as has been speculated to be the case in the n = 1

theories with a similar runaway solution at t = 0 [28].

in the strong coupling region the stable points correspond to |ad|  g2

dt , so that the
phase of ad is irrelevant. the position of the minima at |ad| is not likely to be modied by
higher order terms in the low energy eective theory. however, the possible implications

of the heavy particles, whose mass is proportional to |a|, remain unclear. for instance, if
the monopoles are strictly massless the value of the free energy is higher than at the point

mm = (13g2

dt /12). but since the slope at the origin is zero there is no tendency to oat

away from the massless case, and the theory seems to remain at a local maximum. the

ultimate fate of the massless theory must then be determined by the eects of the heavy

particles.

finally, we would like to comment on the dierent phases that exist at low tempera-

tures. if the temperature initially is much higher than any of the internal scales  and u

in the microscopic theory, we expect to have a nearly free gas of the electrical particles.

as the temperature is lowered, a description of the theory in terms of the low energy

eective action becomes valid. whatever the nature is of this transition, the theory will

end up in one of the minima that exist at low temperatures. the mechanism that drives

the theory to a specic minimum presumably depends on how the scalar eld expectation

value develops as the temperature is lowered. this is certainly a complicated process at

an energy scale where standard methods such as perturbation theory is not applicable.

without reliable information it is obviously very dangerous to make any predictions, but

it is not unreasonable to expect that dierent regions in space could fall into dierent min-

20

ima. in that case, domain walls would form and remain until the temperature vanishes.

needless to say, this scenario is presently by no means rigorous.

appendix

in this appendix we x our notation and illustrate the calculations of the free energy

with a simple example.

starting in minkowski spacetime, our metric has the signature

g = diag (+  ) ,

(a.1)

and the antisymmetric tensor has 0123 = +1. the matrices satisfy {, } = 2g

in minkowski spacetime and then make the following replacements,

(a.5)

where  = t 1, n = 2nt for bosons and n = (2n + 1)t for fermions. labelling the

expression that follows when the minkowski rules and the replacements in equation (a.5)

have been used by (iv f ), with v denoting the volume of the system, the free energy
density is,
