abstract

backreaction of the dynamical casimir eect is investigated by a scalar eective
theory in 1 + 1 dimensions. the adiabatic approximation allows us to treat the
size of the space as a dynamical variable described by the robertson-walker type
metric. the eective action for the size of the space is obtained with the back-
ground eld method in the path-integral formalism. this eective action includes
the contributions from the static and the dynamical casimir eects. from our eec-
tive action we have derived the dynamical casimir force as the backreaction. this
force depends on the mirror velocity, and becomes always stronger than the static
casimir force.

1 introduction

the casimir eect originally suggested in 1948 has been generally regarded as the contri-
bution of a non-trivial geometry on the vacuum uctuations of quantum electromagnetic
elds. the corresponding change in the vacuum uctuations appears as a shift of the
vacuum energy and a resulting vacuum pressure. for a standard example, when we insert
two perfectly conducting parallel plates into the free space r3, the plates are attracted
towards each other [1], although being uncharged. this attractive force is experimentally
conrmed by sparnaay in 1958 [2] and recently more precise measurements have been
provided [3].

the dynamical casimir eect suggests that the non-uniform accelerative motion of
the boundaries (perfect conducting plates or mirrors) excites the electromagnetic eld
and promotes virtual photons from the vacuum into real photons [5, 6]. the works

on the dynamical casimir eect are pioneered by moore [5] and progressed by many
authors [6, 7, 8]. although the phenomena is interesting, this eect has not yet been
experimentally conrmed. this process of particle production also has been predicted in
a variety of general-relativistic situations, e.g., black holes [9, 10], domain wall activity in
cosmology, and the high-speed collision of atomic nuclei [11].

our interest in the dynamical casimir eect is as follows: if moving mirrors create
radiation, the mirrors should experience a radiation-reaction force. a number of authors
have discussed this subject, and the forces such as negative friction have been shown
in (1 + 1)-dimensional cavity [7].
in this paper we propose an eective theory for the
backreaction of the dynamical casimir eect in 1 + 1-dimensions. our eective theory is
constructed by the background eld method in the path-integral formalism. the motion
of the mirrors described by our eective action gives us the dynamical casimir force as the
backreaction, which contains the negative frictional forces. for a massless scalar eld in
1 + 1 dimensions both the static and the dynamical casimir eects exist. the discussion
on the dynamical casimir eect within the adiabatic approximation in 1 + 1 dimensions
is the same as that in 3 + 1 dimensions.

the principal steps for constructing our model are as follows:
(1) we consider a massless scalar eld in one-dimensional nite space with two bound-
aries (one-dimensional disc d1), and require the xed boundary condition, i.e., we consider
the massless scalar eld between two mirrors. the size of the space d(t), namely the
separation of the mirrors, is a dynamical variable depending on the time.

(2) we replace the geometrical conguration from the space d1 to the space s1, and
change the parameterization d(t) from the separation of the boundaries (the size of d1)
into the size of s1. we require that the scalar eld satises the periodic boundary con-
dition rather than the xed boundary condition. this replacement is justied when the
d(t)  1.
relative velocity between the mirrors is much slower than the velocity of light:
this condition on the velocity is referred to as the adiabatic condition. in the adiabatic
treatment of the dynamical casimir eect [6], there are no transitions among the oscilla-
tion modes of the adiabatic hamiltonian. because of this absence of the transitions, the
dynamical casimir eect in the space d1 is the same as that in the space s1 except for
the overall factor in each adiabatic hamiltonian. the overall factor changes into twice
in this replacement. the equivalence between the original system and the replaced one
means that the boundary eect is not essential in the adiabatic approximation, i.e., the
dynamical casimir eect is caused not by the direct contribution of the boundary, but by
the change of eld conguration in the vacuum.

(3) in order to calculate the motion of d(t) as the backreaction to boundaries (mirrors),
we will employ the background eld method: the geometrical conguration of the space
is treated classically and the scalar eld in this space is a quantum object. by integrating
out the scalar eld, we obtain the eective action for d(t) which describes the motion of
the mirrors.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 the general description of our model is
given, and the eective action is obtained. in section 3 the backreaction of the dynamical
casimir eect in our model is investigated, and the dynamical casimir force is derived.
section 4 is devoted to conclusions and discussions.
in appendix it is shown that the
conformal anomaly is induced by means of the fujikawa method [12].

2 scalar model for casimir effects

for the purpose of describing casimir eects in one-dimensional cavity and the reaction
from the casimir eects received by the moving mirrors, we consider a massless scalar eld
in the one-dimensional variable-sized space between two boundaries, i.e. d1 (see figure
1(a)). suppose that the size of the space d(t) is a dynamical variable and it receives
all backreaction of the casimir eects. for the adiabatic motion of the mirrors does not
mix the oscillation modes with each other we can neglect the boundary eect. then the
adiabatic approximation allows us to replace the space d1 to the space s1 (see figure
1(b)). after this replacement our model is dened on the r  s1 space-time, where the
size of s1 space is d(t). we require the periodic boundary condition on the scalar eld,
then the energy levels of the adiabatic oscillation-modes in the original system are two
times those in the replaced system.

in order to describe the size of s1 varying with time, we will dene the the robertson-
walker type metric on the space-time r  s1: ds2 = dt2 + d(t)2dx2 (0  x  a), where
we have redened d(t) as a dimensionless scale factor, and have introduced a dimensional
constant a as a standard size of the space. the classical action of this system is given by
the polyakov action:

s[g, ] =

g.

(1)

this action has a conformal symmetry, i.e., this action has an invariance under the general
coordinate transformation and the weyl transformation. the existence of the conformal

1

symmetry of this action implies that the casimir eects can not classically occur as follows.
here we can always rewrite down the metric to a conformally at form by the general
coordinate transformation:

ds2 = dt2 + d(t)2dx2 = c()(cid:16)d2  dx2(cid:17) = g dxdx,

(2)

where we have introduced a new coordinate  such that d  dt/d(t) and c() 
d(t())2. after performing the weyl transformation g  c1()g, we have the d(t)-
independent at metric:

ds2 = d2 + dx2 =  dxdx.

(3)

this implies that any deformation of the space-size does not aect the classical action,
i.e., the casimir eects are essentially quantum eects.

for evaluating the contribution of the casimir eects, we present a path integral
formulation. we use background eld method in which the metric is treated as classical
eld and the scalar eld is quantized. the eective action for the metric, [g], is given
by

ei[g ] = z d eis[g, ].

(4)

in order to calculate the eective action for any time evolving metric (2), we perform
the conformal transformation on the eective action (4) from any time evolving metric
(2) to the at metric (3): g  e2g = c1()g = . by means of the fujikawa
method [12] this conformal transformation picks up the conformal anomaly as a jacobian
factor from the path-integral measure in the eective action (4):

ei[g ] = exp"

2 z d2x (x)xn

n(x) n(x)#  ei[ ],

(5)

where the parameter of the conformal transformation (x) is chosen as (x) =  1
2 ln c(),
and {n(x)} is a complete set which consists of the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian (see
appendix). here the rst exponential factor in (5) is the conformal anomaly, and the latter
factor is the partition function for the free scalar eld in the space s1 with xed radius.

2.1 casimir energy in cylindrical space-time

2.2 conformal anomaly in space-time r  s1
we will evaluate the conformal anomaly in the space-time rs1. it is formally expressed
by the rst exponent in the right hand side of (5). this anomaly part appears when the
size of the space s1 is varying with time. then the anomaly part describes the terms of the
backreaction of the dynamical casimir eect. in the euclidean space-time with the metric

on the other hand the well-known polyakov-liouville action [14], which is the confor-
mal anomaly in the space-time r2, brings the same result as (28). the polyakov-liouville

3 backreaction of the dynamical

casimir effect

we will study the backreaction of the dynamical casimir eect by considering the relative
motion of the mirrors (boundaries). assume that the mirrors receive the force derived
by the static and the dynamical casimir eects. the system of the mirrors is supposed to
have nite reduced mass m for the mirror-separation d(t), the dynamical variable in this
system. when the mirrors are free, the system obeys the classical equation of motion.

then we describe the system by the classical kinetic term m

except for the overall factor 2. the overall factor is caused by the dierence of the energy
levels of the oscillating modes as mentioned in section 1 and section 2. this equivalence

where  is the number of species of scalar elds. in this action the second term is the

thus e is the energy of this system. here it should be noticed that the semi-classical
condition m  1/d(t) and the adiabatic condition d(t)  1 lead to the validity condition
|e|  m. combining the equation of the motion (32) and the description of the energy
(33), we obtain the mutual dynamical force between the mirrors (boundaries), namely the

4 conclusion and discussion

we have investigated the eective theory for the backreaction of the dynamical casimir
eect in the adiabatic approximation. the resultant dynamical casimir force from the
static and the dynamical casimir eects becomes attractive and always stronger than the
static casimir force.

the adiabatic approximation allows us to neglect the boundary eect under deforming
the separation of the mirrors d(t). then we have considered the scalar eective theory
in the space-time r  s1 with the robertson-walker type metric rather than in the
space-time r  d1. our eective action (31) consists of the static casimir energy term,
the backreaction term of the dynamical casimir eect and the classical kinetic term of
the mirrors. the static casimir energy arises from the compactness of the space. the
backreaction term is described by conformal anomaly. the classical kinetic term is added
by hand.

the backreaction discussed in this paper is comparable to the backreaction of the
hawking radiation from the two-dimensional dilaton black hole. in the two-dimensional
dilaton black hole (cghs model [16]) the hawking radiation is represented by the con-
formal anomaly [16], and the backreaction appears as decreasing the black-hole mass [17].
in our model the contribution from the dynamical casimir eect to the mirrors has
generated a negative denite kinetic term, which also appeared in the analysis of cghs
model [17]. although this looks strange, it should be noticed that the following point: for
we have assumed that the mass scale of the mirrors m is much greater than the scale of the
casimir energy  d1, the contribution of the negative denite term is only perturbative
to the main kinetic one. then our result is reliable.

m,
the dynamical casimir force fdyn seems to become repulsive in our result (36). while the
semi-classical treatment becomes inappropriate at that time, this repulsive force might be
realized, if one considers that the motion of the mirrors obeys the quantum mechanics.

appendix

in this appendix we briey explain the derivation of the eective action (5) from the
denition of the eective action (4). this derivation is based on the evaluation of the
conformal anomaly by the fujikawa method [12]. in order to perform the path integration
of (4), we make a wick rotation by introducing an imaginary time variable x2  i. then
the euclidean metric corresponding to the minkowski one (2) becomes

the euclidean eective action is

by introducing   4g  and changing the measure d into the invariant form under
the general coordinate transformation d , equation (38) becomes

here we have used a notation    1 1 + 2 2. we perform a mode expansion
of the eld (x) in terms of a complete set {n(x)}:

(x) = xn

ann(x)  xn hx|ni an,

where we have chosen n(x) as an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian operator:

h =

hn(x) = 2

n n(x).

here n(x) satises the normalization r d2x m(x) n(x) = mn. now we note that the
measure d  is expressed by the mode coecients an as
d  = yx d (x) = [ dethx|ni ] yn

dan = yn

under weyl transformation g  e2(x)g the mode-coecients of the eld (x), an,

are transformed as an innitesimal form:

an n(x),

(x)  (x)  xn
an = an + xm

2 z d2x (x)n(x) m(x)am  xm

then the measure is transformed as

d  = yn

dan = [det(cnm)] yl

this gives the jacobian of the conformal transformation. by the weyl transformation
chosen (x) =  1

where the second factor equals to the partition function of the free scalar eld in the at
space-time. finally, we can arrive at our destination (5) from the description (45) by the
inverse of the wick rotation.
