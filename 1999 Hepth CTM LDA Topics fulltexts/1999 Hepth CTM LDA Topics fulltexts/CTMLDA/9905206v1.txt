abstract

renormalization group ow equations for scalar 4 are generated using three classes
of smooth smearing functions. numerical results for the critical exponent  in three di-
mensions are calculated by means of a truncated series expansion of the blocked potential.
we demonstrate how the convergence of  as a function of the order of truncation can be
improved through a ne tuning of the smoothness of the smearing functions.

i. introduction

renormalization group (rg) methods provide a powerful tool for investigating non-
perturbative physical phenomena [1].
issues such as qcd under extreme conditions,
formation of a quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [2], or critical phe-
nomena in condensed matter systems all cannot be treated using standard perturbation
theory due to the presence of infrared (ir) singularities. through the continuous elimina-
tion of degrees of freedom, rg techniques systematically resum the perturbative series and
therefore can provide information about nonperturbative eects in these systems. however,
the power of rg relies on the existence of ecient analytic and computational methods
since the full rg ow equations cannot be solved exactly. the goal of this paper is to
show how to optimize the way the degrees of freedom are eliminated in order to improve
results obtained using approximate rg ow equations.

for a eld theoretical system a continuous rg transformation can be realized by
introducing a smearing function k(x) which governs the coarse-graining procedure [3]
[4]. the scale k acts as an eective ir cuto that separates the low- and high-momentum
modes. using this smearing function an averaged blocked eld can be dened as

from which one obtains the eective legendre blocked action:

k(x  y)(y),

k(x) =zy
eesk[(x)] =z d[]yx

(k(x)  (x))es[] .

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.4)

in this manner we achieve a smooth interpolation between the bare action s[] dened

at the ultraviolet (uv) cuto, , and the quantum eective action esk[], which generates

those one-particle-irreducible graphs whose internal momenta extend between k and  [5].
the introduction of a smearing function leads to a modication of the bare propagator:

(p) =

1
p2  k(p) =

1  k(p)

p2

=

k(p)

p2

,

(1.3)

with k(p) + k(p) = 1. one can then derive a rg equation for the blocked action which

remains valid in all orders of the loop expansion by varying esk innitesimally with k:

since the pioneering work of wilson [1], similar rg equations have been derived and
analyzed. a sharp momentum cuto was rst used by wegner and houghton [6], and

2

[7],

further discussed in refs.
[8] and [9]. polchinski [10], on the other hand, employed a
smooth cuto. there exists a vast amount of literature devoted to this subject [11]. such
functional rg equations, as stated before, have proven too dicult to be solved exactly,
and further approximations are needed. any viable scheme must not only retain the
nonperturbative characteristics of the rg, but also converge suciently rapidly without
inducing further spurious eects. as demonstrated by morris in his seminal papers [5] [12],
the most reliable method so far for probing the low-energy eective theory is the derivative
expansion:

(1.5)

esk[] =zx(cid:26) zk()

2

()2 + uk() + o(4)(cid:27),

where zk() and uk() are, respectively, the wavefunction renormalization and the blocked
potential. at leading order in the derivative expansion zk() is taken to be unity and the
low-energy eective action is described solely in terms of uk() [13]. this local potential
approximation (lpa) results in the following ow equation:

k

uk()

k

=

1

2zp(cid:16)k

 k(p)

k (cid:17)

u 

k ()

p2 + k(p)u 

k ()

.

(1.6)

although the above expression can be derived exactly [14], it may also be obtained by a
dierentiation of the perturbative one-loop result

u (1)

k () =

1

2zp

ln(cid:26)1 + k(p)

v ()

p2 (cid:27)

(1.7)

k () on the right-hand-side.

with respect to ln(k) followed by a substitution v ()  u 
clearly, the functional form of the rg equation for uk() depends on the choice of
the smearing function. a sharp cuto, k(p) = (k  p), provides a well-dened boundary
between the high- and low-momentum modes and yields a nonlinear partial dierential
equation. on the other hand, for a general smooth cuto, no clear separation exists
and the rg ow remains an integro-dierential equation. according to the universality
principle the shape of the smearing function, k(p), does not inuence the physics of nite
length scales. so long as the eective action contains all marginal or relevant operators
the resulting rg ow must be scheme independent. at leading order in the derivative
expansion, with no further approximation involved, physical results are indeed independent
of the shape of k(p), as demonstrated in [5] [15]. however, at next-to-leading order in the
derivative expansion where the eect of zk() is included, the critical properties of the
system will depend on whether k(p) is sharp or smooth. in fact, ambiguities arise in the
former, although self-consistency arguments can be used to circumvent this diculty [16].
the dependence of , the anomalous dimension, on the shape of the smearing function
beyond leading order, has been calculated in [15] [17].

the critical exponents and other universal properties of the system may vary when
they are determined in the vicinity of the xed point of the truncated equation given in
eq. (1.6), or when the theory moves far away from the critical manifold. in fact, even
if the solution includes all the relevant operators, the neglected irrelevant parameters are
still evolving at the xed point of the truncated equation. since the modication of the

3

irrelevant operators amounts to a change of an overall scale factor of the theory this scale
factor remains cuto dependent at the approximate xed point. in order to minimize its
variation one has to retain in the approximation the irrelevant operators with the critical
exponent.

a frequently used technique is to expand uk() in power series of  followed by a trun-
cation at some order, thereby turning the problem into solving a set of coupled nonlinear
ordinary dierential equations. although the numerical algorithms are simplied by this
expansion, the convergence of critical exponents calculated in this way is not guaranteed.
in fact, when employing a sharp smearing function while uk() is expanded in  about the
origin, the critical exponent  has been shown to oscillate about its expected value as m ,
the number of terms in the series, is increased [12]. the convergence improves, however,
if the expansion is made around the k-dependent minimum of uk() [9]. unfortunately,
this approach fails when applied to an o(n ) eld theory in the symmetry-broken phase
due to the presence of the massless goldstone modes which cause ir divergences to persist
[14] [18]. it is therefore desirable to identify a computational method which does not suf-
fer from these drawbacks. in addition, for gauge theories, the numerical complication of
solving the non-truncated ow equations is even more overwhelming because of the prolif-
eration of degrees of freedom and the complexity of their interactions. for these theories
a polynomial truncation of the blocked potential seems inevitable. thus, it is crucial to
understand how to improve results obtained from truncation schemes.

in the present work, we examine what happens, in the truncated polynomial expan-
sion of uk(), when a smooth smearing function k,(p) with  being the smoothness
parameter, is utilized instead of (k  p). in particular, we explore how  changes with
m as the smooth smearing functions approach the sharp limit, and how its convergence is
inuenced by . our goal is to obtain a prescription which eliminates or diminishes the
oscillations mentioned above and ensures a rapid convergence as m is increased.

in sec.

the organization of the paper is as follows.

ii we give three examples of
smooth smearing functions and derive the corresponding rg equations. we show how
the expected sharp cuto limit can be recovered by recognizing that k(p) is a continuous
in
function in the vicinity p  k. finite-temperature rg equations are also derived.
sec. iii we present the numerical solutions for  associated with the three-dimensional
wilson-fisher xed point at various levels of polynomial truncation of uk().
in sec.
iv the source of scheme dependence on m and  is discussed. we propose an optimized
smooth smearing function which leads to a maximal cancellation of the eects of irrelevant
operators and provides the fastest convergence of  to a value which is in good agreement
with the worlds best estimate. sec. v is reserved for summary and discussions.

ii. smooth cutoff functions

we begin by considering a general smooth representation of the smearing function
k,(p) = (k, p) which approaches (k  p) as   0. due to the singular nature of
the step function ambiguities can arise when taking the limit   0. more precisely, one
will encounter terms involving (0)  0. since this value is not uniquely specied for

4

the smooth parameterizations of the step function, it would seem that the approach to the
sharp limit is not unique. the naive, or mean, approach in the limit   0 is:

z 

0

dp

(k, p)

k

g((k, p), p) z 

0

dp (k  p)g(0, p) = g(0, k),

(2.1)

where k(k, p)  (k  p). this prescription, however, is oversimplied because the
integrand of

dp g((k, p), p)),

(2.2)

z 

0

is not uniformly convergent as   0. the proper treatment requires that (k, p) be
used as an integration variable. thus by setting (k, p) = (1  p/k) = t and making a
change of variables from p to t, we have

z 

0

dp

(k, p)

dp(cid:1)g(t, p) = z t(p=)

t(p=0)

(2.3)
the sharp cuto limit is obtained when t(p = 0) = 1, t(p = ) = 0, p(t) = k and eq.
(2.3) simplies to

z

where sd = 2/(4)d/2(d/2), z(t) = p(t)/k and u 
k ()/k2. thus, with a given
k,(p)  t, we rst invert the expression to obtain z(t) and then make a substitution into
eq. (2.5) to deduce the corresponding smooth rg equation for uk().
as stated in the introduction, when a truncated polynomial expansion is used, physical
quantities such as the critical exponents may depend on m as well as on . for a sharp
cuto, the critical exponent  has been shown to exhibit oscillatory behavior about its
expected value when uk() is expanded about the origin or the k-dependent minimum
[7][12], although the result improves signicantly in the latter [9]. in order to determine
whether these oscillations can be removed or reduced by using a smooth smearing function
we consider below three parameterizations of k,(p), all of which approach (kp), when
the appropriate limit of the smoothness parameter  is taken.

dence in k,(p). nevertheless, we shall see that the dierence between the two equations
does not aect the critical properties signicantly in the next section.

a comparison of the two ow equations shows that in order to recover the standard per-
turbative rg coecient functions in the uv limit 2
k  1, the usual convention 0 = 1/2
must be imposed. however, this choice also implies a deviation of scaling for a massive
theory in the ir regime where 2

it is easy to understand that the two ows agree in the uv scaling regime only. in
fact, the non-uniform convergence in eq. (2.2) leads to an incorrect use of the integrand
of the evolution equation eq. (1.6) at p  k when the limit   0 is taken before the
integration. since the integrand is independent of the eld  for k2  u 
k () the mistake
is unimportant. but the naive evolution equation displays wrong u 
k () dependence when

require k,b(p = k) = 1/2, which in turn implies a = ln 2, or k,b(p) = 2(p/k)b

the sharp limit, on the other hand, gives c1 = 1 and c2 = 1/2 independent of dimen-
sionality d. thus, c1 and c2 provide a measure of the deviation from the sharp-cuto uv
scaling. we also note that in order to avoid uv singularities in the integrations, b must
be chosen as to avoid singularities in the gamma functions above. as b is decreased the
cuto becomes smoother. the location of the peak in k,b(p)/p is stable for large b and
starts to shift at b  3. for b <
 3, the shape of k,b(p) spreads in such a manner that one
can no longer associate a well-dened cuto value.

lastly, we consider a power-law smearing function:

makes it dicult to identify a clear cuto value.

unlike the previous two parameterizations where the integro-dierential ow equations
must be solved numerically, for certain values of d and m analytic evaluation of the integral

iii. fixed-point solutions and numerical results

as seen in the last section, when the smearing function is smooth the ow of the
theory is generally characterized by an integro-dierential equation, as opposed to the
dierential equation obtained with the sharp cuto or special cases of a smooth cuto. in
dimensionless form, the ow equation reads:

momentum scale z(t) is given by eqs. (2.12), (2.24) or (2.30) for the three cases considered.
that sd can be absorbed by a redenition of  is an indication of universality, i.e., critical
exponents are independent of sd, though the matrix elements in the linearized rg matrix
are.
in the above, the anomalous dimension  has been set to zero since we are only
considering the ow of the potential.

to characterize the critical behavior of the theory, our rst task is to identify all the
xed points and then linearize rg about a particular xed point. it is well known that
for the one-component scalar theory in d = 3, there are only two xed points: one trivial
gaussian and one wilson-fisher, and the critical behavior is dominated by the latter. no
other continuum limit is known to exist. this applies to both the sharp and the smooth
cutos. however, for a general smooth function k,(p), the location of the wilson-fisher
xed point which will now depend on ; at  = 0, however, it coincides with the gaussian
one.

at the xed point(s), the theory exhibits scale invariance, i.e. k u 

equation for the xed point potential becomes (dropping the subscript k):

k = 0, and the rg

we comment that the location of the xed point as well as u ( ), being non-universal,
naturally all depend on the choice of the smearing function k(p). in the one extreme where

the equation can be exactly solved to give u ( ) = a 2d/(d2). for  = 1 or d = 3,
u   6. thus, with vanishing contributions from quantum uctuations, the only xed
point is gaussian (2, ) = (0, 0). however, this does not mean that the theory is free,
because we still have u ( ) 6= 0.
for the general case of a smooth cuto function, however, it is rather dicult to obtain
a non-truncated solution for eq. (3.2), and we circumvent the problem with polynomial
truncation at order 2m . the remaining task is to solve a system of m integro-dierential
equations for the coupling constants g(2),  = 1,    , m . we rst determine the xed-
point solution analytically in the sharp cuto limit, so that we can then use this as an
initial guess in our numerical root-nding subroutine for the smooth case. the system of
integro-dierential equations is solved by rst choosing a large value for the smoothness
parameter  (1/, b, or m), thereby making the smearing function rather sharp. the
smoothness of the cuto function is increased in small steps by decreasing the parameters,
and the solution of the previous step is used as the guess for nding the solution at the
current step. in this manner we are able to track the solution associated with a physical
xed point from the sharp cuto limit to an arbitrary smoothness.

with the strategies outlined above, we now present the results for all three smearing

functions considered in sec. ii.

in fig. 1 we plot the dependence of  in d = 3 as a function of the (inverse) smoothness

parameter 1 at four dierent levels of truncation of u (). from the gure, we see that

 varies by 2-5% over the range shown. the variation would become even larger had we
taken 1  0, where the smearing function becomes very at and there is practically no
blocking. the exponents in this limit are those obtained in the mean-eld approximation,

e.g.,  = 0.5.

it is also interesting to note that at each order in m there is a dip, or

an extremum whose position changes only slightly with m . the non-monotonic behavior

shows that when going to the sharp limit by gradually increasing 1,  rst deviates from

the sharp result and then begins to converge when k,(p) becomes suciently sharp.

when an exponential smearing function is employed instead, we observe a similar

behavior for , as depicted in figure 2. once more, the value varies by 2-5% and an

extremum is found for each m . the qualitative feature remains the same for a power-law

smearing function, as demonstrated in figure 3. however, in this case the variation of 

is only about 2-3%.

iv. scheme dependence

even though non-truncated solutions for the xed-point potential u ( ) can be ob-
tained in special cases [12], this is not possible in general. any approximation inevitably
brings in scheme-dependent eects. our results are seen to depend both on the order of
truncation m as well as the smoothness parameter . we discuss below the implications
of such dependence.

a. truncation dependence

at order m we obtain m xed-point solutions parameterized by the critical coupling
constants (g(2)    g(2m )), each having its own eigenvectors and eigenvalues which in
turn can be used for calculating the critical exponents. however, only one of the solu-
tions corresponds to the wilson-fisher xed point which is characterized by one relevant
operator, with the rest being irrelevant. the trivial gaussian solution with all g(2) = 0
is also obtained but is of no interest to us. computational artifacts are induced with a
polynomial truncation of the blocked potential uk( ) [9][12][16]. for example, as m is
increased, numerous unphysical xed points are also generated.

thus, to isolate the physically meaningful solution from the unphysical ones in the
smooth parameterization, what we have done numerically was to rst analyze the sharp
cuto limit of eq. (3.2) and identify the solution associated with the wilson-fisher xed
point. the salient feature of this solution is that it is stable against an increase in m . in
other words, the value of g(2) is not sensitive to whether higher order coupling constants,

15

e.g., g(2+2), are included or not. on the other hand, unphysical solutions are sensitive to
the higher order equations and their eigenvalues will uctuate in an unpredictable manner
[8].

another prominent artifact of the polynomial truncation is the oscillation of the
critical exponents with m when a sharp cuto is used. the values of the critical cou-
pling constants also alternate in sign. the oscillations are due to the nonanalyticity
of the critical blocked potential u ( ) and can be understood from the fact that an
expansion of the right-hand-side of the sharp cuto ow equation ln(1 + u 
( )) =
( ))/ also yields a power series of  with alternating sign. even
though the convergence has been shown to improve signicantly by expanding uk( )
around its moving minimum, there still remains residual scheme dependence [9]. in addi-
tion, an expansion about the minimum fails in the broken phase of o(n ) as stated in the
introduction. therefore, it is desirable to have a numerical technique which allows for an
ecient determination of the critical properties, and remove or reduce the aforementioned
spurious eects.

p
=1(1)(+1)( u 

another subtle issue remains in this approximation is: why can we not reproduce the
exact critical exponent(s) by keeping only the renormalizable coupling constants in our
computation and in the identication of the xed point? the main reason lies in that fact
the xed point of the truncated solution is applicable only up to the operators which have
been neglected. at the point which we call a xed point, the would-be ignored set of
irrelevant operators does not vanish but continues to evolve. on the other hand, in the
exact rg approach, the xed-point condition implies a complicated cancellation between
dierent operators. when all the operators are present, the cancellation is complete and
we should be able to eliminate the k,(p)-dependence in the scaling laws around the xed
point as well as in the expression for the critical exponents.

b. smoothness dependence

in the alternative wilson or polchinski rg approach, one can show that when the
eective action is expanded in terms of derivatives to order n, only 2n parameters are
required to absorb the scheme dependence [15]. therefore, at the leading order of uk()
with n = 0, the critical exponents must be scheme-independent, i.e., the same results are
obtained regardless of whether the smearing function is sharp, exponential or power-like.
in fact, k,(p) can be conveniently absorbed by a suitable redenition of the eld variable
[20]. scheme depedence appears, however, when the wavefunction renormalization zk()
is taken into consideration at the next order.

on the other hand, eq. (3.1) derived with lpa does not possess this scaling property,
and the functional form of the ow equation is explicitly dependent of k,(p). the depen-
dence, nevertheless, is expected to be negligible in the calculation of physical quantities
such as the critical exponents. this universality hypothesis, however, must be substan-
tiated by solving the integro-dierential equation eq. (3.1) exactly without polynomial
expansion.

from figures 1, 2 and 3, the critical exponent  clearly depends on the smoothness
parameter  (1, b and m). this comes as a consequence of polynomial truncation. that
is, because of the polynomial truncation scheme employed, physical results now depend
both on the level of truncation m as well as on .

16

how can such dependence be reconciled with universality? the key to the problem
here again lies in the role played by the irrelevant operators in the approximate solution.
if we solve the rg equation for the full theory and come down to the ir regime, the
dependence on the initial condition for the irrelevant operators must die out according
to the universality hypothesis. the explicit verication of this scenario by reaching the
ir xed point in principle requires an innite number of iterations. this is not what
was followed in this work. instead we move close to the uv xed point and a linearized
rg prescription is utilized to deduce the critical exponents and the corresponding scaling
laws. using the derivative expansion and the polynomial truncation schemes gives the
advantage of a readily accessible (approximate) xed-point solution; however, we are no
longer certain what the omitted irrelevant operators do. if they are not scale invariant at
the xed point - the likely result of the truncation, then their variation amounts to the
change of the overall scale factor of the exact solution of the theory. this is because the
irrelevant coupling constant set of the theory inuences an overall scale factor. in order to
minimize this scale dependence the truncation scheme must be improved.

the comparison with the exact rg oers a direction of improvement in our approx-
imation: to minimize the number and the strength of the neglected irrelevant operators.
as far as the k,(p)-dependence is concerned, the momentum dependent, i.e. higher order
derivative terms come into consideration which are quadratic in the eld . therefore, we
aim to minimize the number of such terms generated in the rg ow. the cuto-function
k,(p) is strongly momentum dependent in an interval p = k. according to the un-
certanity principle this yields non-local interactions on the length scale x = 1/k. in
order to eliminate such a higher order derivative eect from the theory we must look for a
cuto which is as smooth as possible in the momentum space. this would yield a better
convergence when the irrelevant derivative operators are truncated, in accord with the
spirit of lpa.

however, there are also higer-order eld operators and we should keep m as low as
possible. we emphasize that the purpose of employing a truncated polynomial expansion
of uk() is to devise a simple algorithm which allows us to reproduce the nonperturbative
features, particularly the xed-point structure embedded in lpa, or even the blocked

action esk[], without having to solve the full ow equation for uk(). thus, to go to a

large m not only is computationally laborious but also in conict with the original goal.
in fig. 4 the truncation dependence of  obtained using the exponential smearing
function given in eq. (2.21) is depicted. the sharp cuto results are also included for
comparative purpose. we notice the general trend of a more pronounced oscillatory be-
havior as b is increased toward the sharp limit. this again show that the sharp cuto is
not the best candidate if we look for the smallest set of operators which yields the most
rapid convergence for the physical observables. below we demonstrate how this can be
achieved with an optimization scheme.

c. optimization

for a sharp cuto, with a clear boundary between the high and the low modes, the
ir cuto is determined unambiguously as k. however, we wish to choose the cuto to be
as smooth as possible in order to minimize the generation of non-local, higher-derivative
irrelevant interactions, as well as the order of truncation m . a general smooth smearing
function k,(p) results in a shift in the actual value of the ir cuto, or the location of
the peak of k,(p)/p. when k,(p) is too smooth, we no longer have a well-dened
cuto, i.e., the relation between the parameter k and the momenta of the modes appearing
in the evolution equation.

as we have shown before, with the truncation scheme employed, the xed-point solu-
tions will vary with m and the would-be irrelevant operators will continue to contribute
and evolve around the these approximate solutions. thus, we would not expect a priori
an accurate result for the critical exponents in this case. nevertheless, we notice that for
each of the three smearing functions discussed in sec. ii, there is an optimal value of
 for which  converges most rapidly. for example, the optimal value for the exponential
function is found to be b = 3, which incidentally coincides with the value of the extremum
shown in figure 2. when all three smearing functions are superimposed, it can be seen
that they have approximately the same shape or smoothness, as illustrated in fig. 5. that
is, the most optimal smoothness does not depend on the detailed form of the smearing,
i.e., hyperbolic tangent, exponential or power-law.

the truncation dependence of  for the three optimized smearing functions is ilus-
trated in fig. 6. although there remains small oscillations, we see a dramatic improvement
in the convergence. in fact, the variation beyond m = 7 is only 1-2%. our optimized value
gives  = 0.65(5) which is closer to the worlds best value 0.631(2) [21] than 0.68(9) ob-
tained by aoki et. al. using an expansion around the moving minimum. we also remark
that m , the number of operators involved in our calculation, is considerably smaller for a
reasonably accurate estimate of  [9]. however, by truncating the potential at m = 12,
we have not been able to observe the oscillation of  with m at a four-fold periodicity; an
unambiguous observation of such behavior generally would require m  20 [9][12].

why is  related to the convergence of the series expansion? physically, the param-
eter dictates the manner in which the quantum uctuations modes are integrated over.

19

when  is very small and the corresponding smearing function is too smooth, certain fast-
uctuating modes are only damped but not integrated over due to the lack of a well-dened
boundary. in addition, some slowly-varying degrees of freedom which should be kept are
integrated. as a result of the mistreatment of both the fast and the slow modes, the rg
trajectory is greatly distorted, and the would-be irrelevant higher-order operators continue
to evolve near the critical point obtained at order m .

the complicated interplay between the irrelevant operators can also be seen from the
non-monotonic dependence of  on  observed in figures 1 to 3. an extremum is found
at c for all orders of m . while for c is a local maximum for m = 2, it becomes a local
minimum for m  3. the ip is clearly due to the inclusion of the irrelevant (marginal by
power counting) 6 operator.
in general, as  increases and more fast modes are being included in the loop inte-
grations, more cancellations between the eects of the irrelevant operators take place and
the theory moves closer to the true wilson-fisher xed point found in the exact approach.
nevertheless, when  becomes too large and the resulting smearing function is too sharp,
non-local eects begins to set in and the theory drifts away from the true rg trajectory.
at  =  where the smearing function becomes a step function (k  p), non-local eects
become maximal and lpa is no longer adequate. one must then include derivative oper-

result.

ators to all orders in the blocked action esk[] in order to arrive at a scheme-independent

thus, we see that  monitors the manner in which the irrelevant operators contribute
to the ow of the theory. when the most optimal smoothness is reached, the maximum
cancellation between these operators takes place, leading to the fastest convergence in the
polynomial truncation.

in sec. ii we have also discussed an alternative mean approach, which is based on
taking the sharp cuto limit followed by a substitution of 0 = 1/2 to avoid ambiguity,
and yields eq. (2.14) as the rg ow. we solve the equation and depict the result for  in
figure 7.

contrary to the sharp approach which results in an oscillatory behavior,  is seen to
converge rapidly. such a change in the convergence is intimately related to the structure
of the untruncated xed-point potential u ( ) [5] which now obeys

even though eq. (4.1) still cannot be solved analytically, its improvement in con-
vergence can be shown by examining the right-hand-side of the equation representing
the quantum corrections. by making a taylor expansion of the expression with respect to

lation more quantitatively, however, would require a detailed knowledge of the singularities
of the untruncated potential u ( ).

v. summary and discussions

in the present work we have demonstrated how one can improve the convergence of
critical exponents calculated using polynomial truncations of the rg ow equation for the
blocked potential uk(). since in the sharp limit,  oscillates with m , the order of trunca-
tion, we examined three parameterizations of a smooth cuto function, hyperbolic tangent,
exponential, and power-law, and made an attempt to eliminate as much as possible such
unphysical artifacts. we nd that there exists an optimal smoothness value which gives
the most rapid convergence as a function of m . this is due to the maximal cancellation
of the eects generated by the irrelevant operators in the blocked action. our optimal
smearing functions yield  = 0.65(5) for m  7 with a variation of 1-2% between the three
cases. had  been too large, we would have to incorporate the higher-order derivative
operators to account for the non-local eects generated in the course of rg evolution.

we have also learned from comparing the results for the sharp limit and the mean
approach (depicted in figure 7) that the convergence behavior of the polynomial truncation
scheme is intimately related to the non-truncated solution of uk( ). the mean approach
results in a larger radius of convergence, and hence a more rapid convergence. it remains
to see if the same trick can be utilized for more complicated systems as well.

in light of the success of our optimized rg prescription, we can readily extend the
formalism to address other issues such as the o(n ) models, the spinodal instability [22],
gauge theories or chiral symmetry breaking. it would also be interesting to compare our
usual momentum-cuto approch with an alternative internal-space rg, which is a func-
tional generalization of the callan-symanzyk equation, based on an innitesimal variation
of an internal-space parameter such as the mass scale [23].
