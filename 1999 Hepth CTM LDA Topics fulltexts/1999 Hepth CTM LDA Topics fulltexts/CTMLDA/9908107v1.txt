abstract: we consider a free (2k)-form gauge-eld on a euclidean (4k + 2)-manifold. the parameters
needed to specify the action and the gauge-invariant observables take their values in spaces with natural
complex structures. we show that the correlation functions can be written as a nite sum of terms,
each of which is a product of a holomorphic and an anti-holomorphic factor. the holomorphic factors
are naturally interpreted as correlation functions for a chiral (2k)-form, i.e. a (2k)-form with a self-dual
(2k + 1)-form eld strength, after wick rotation to a minkowski signature.

introduction

higher rank abelian gauge elds play a prominent role in string theory, although their geometrical meaning
is not quite clear. locally, such a eld is given by a p-form b modulo the gauge equivalence relation
b  b + b, where b is a closed p-form with integer periods. when p = 1, this is just an ordinary
abelian gauge eld with its usual gauge invariance.

on a d-manifold m , a natural class of gauge invariant observables can be written in the form

exp 2irm b  p , where p is a closed (d  p)-form with integer periods. for example, if p is the
poincare dual of some p-cycle  in m , we get the wilson volume observable exp 2ir b associated

with . a product of such observables is again of the same form with the resulting parameter p being
the sum of the p s of the dierent factors. to compute the expectation value of such an observable, it
is in fact sucient to consider the case when p is trivial in cohomology, i.e. when p = 2dq for some
(d  p  1)-form q. (the factor of 2 is inserted for later convenience.) for example, p could be twice the
poincare dual of a homologically trivial p-cycle  in m . the observable is then of the form

w (q) = exp 4izm

h  q,

(1)

where h = db is the gauge invariant (p + 1)-form eld strength of b. the reason that we do not need
to consider cohomologically non-trivial p is that in this case, the b-eld would contain a closed mode
poincare dual to p . furthermore, this mode does not appear in the action that we will discuss shortly.
because of the gauge invariance, the coecient of this mode takes its values on a circle. the expectation
value of the observable then vanishes, because its phase averages to zero when we integrate over this
mode. this phenomenon is well known for a compact scalar in two dimensions, where it corresponds to
conservation of discrete momentum (in a string theory compactication).

if m is endowed with a metric g, it is natural to consider the generalized maxwell action

s = 

2

g2 zm

h  h,

(2)

where  denotes the hodge duality operator that maps a (p + 1)-form to a (d  p  1)-form, and g is a
coupling constant. the classical equation of motion that follows from this action is

dh = 0,

(3)

i.e. a eld strength h that fullls the classical equation of motion is harmonic. we can now calculate
the (unnormalized) expectation value of the observable w (q) as

hw (q)i =z db w (q)es,

(4)

where the functional integral is over gauge inequivalent eld congurations b.

in this paper, we will be concerned with the case when d = 4k + 2 and p = 2k for some integer k. a
priori, we are interested in the case when the metric g has a minkowski signature, which means that the
hodge duality operator  obeys   = 1, so that its eigenvalues are 1. we now say that a gauge eld b
is chiral if its eld strength h = db obeys the self-duality equation

h = +h.

2

(5)

from this rst order dierential equation in fact follows the second-order equation of motion (3). similarly,
an anti-chiral gauge eld has an anti self-dual eld strength. chiral gauge elds have many important
applications in string theory. for example, in d = 2 dimensions, chiral zero-form (scalars) appear on the
world-sheet of heterotic string theory. in d = 6 dimensions, the world-volume theory of the m -theory ve-
brane contains a chiral two-form. finally, in d = 10 dimensions, type iib supergravity contains a chiral
four-form. in d = 2 dimensions, there is a well-known interacting generalization of the theory, namely
the chiral wess-zumino-witten model. in d = 6 dimensions, the tensionless string theories generalize
the theory of a free (0, 2) tensor multiplet (which contains a chiral two-form). in d = 10 dimensions, no
interacting generalization is known.

one can show that the self-duality equation (5) cannot follow from any covariant lagrangian in the
usual sense. it is therefore a bit subtle to dene the quantum theory of a chiral gauge eld [2]. the
main idea is as follows: one starts with the non-chiral theory with action (2). the eld strength h then
contains both a self-dual and an anti self-dual part. however, since the theory is free, i.e. the action is a
bilinear in the gauge eld b, one would expect that the chiral and anti-chiral parts are decoupled from
each other. furthermore, observables of the form (1) are exponentials of linear expressions in b. one
would therefore expect that the correlation function (4) can be written as the product of the correlation
functions pertaining to a chiral gauge eld and an anti-chiral gauge eld. (we will explain the criterion
for how to perform this factorization in the next section.) on a manifold m of non-vanishing middle
dimensional betti number b2k+1 = dim h 2k+1(m, r), the story is in fact more complicated. it will turn
out that there are then 2b2k+1 dierent candidate chiral and anti-chiral correlation functions. assembling
these into vectors hw (q)i+ and hw (q)i respectively, one can write the non-chiral correlation function
as

hw (q)i = hw (q)i+  hw (q)i ,

(6)

where the raised dot denotes the vector scalar product. to dene the correlation function of a chiral gauge-
eld, one would thus need some extra discrete data to pick out one of the terms in (6). in applications,
this choice is in fact often dictated by the physical context [2]. (on a torus, it turns out that there is
a canonical choice which is invariant under the sl(4k + 2, z) mapping class group. the corresponding
chiral partition function was calculated in the case of a at metric in [3].)

in this paper, we will carry out the procedure outlined in [2] in detail and derive (6) explicitly. we
will consider the exact quantum correlation function for a general observable of the form (1).
(the
discussion in [2] focuses on the partition function and the contributions to the functional integral (4)
from eld congurations that solve the classical equations of motion (3). in that paper, the theory is
coupled to a background (2k + 1)-form, that is put to zero in this paper.) in the next section, we will
describe how to separate a non-chiral correlation function into its chiral and anti-chiral parts. in fact,
the non-chiral correlation function also contains certain anomalous factors that have to be discarded in
order for the factorization (6) to work. in section 3, we will evaluate the contributions due to classical
eld congurations, and in the last section we will consider the quantum uctuations.

2.1 the complex structure

we thus consider the case of a (2k + 1)-form gauge eld b in a (4k + 2)-dimensional space m . the
coupling constant g in (2) is then dimensionless, so that the action is scale invariant and in fact only
depends on the conformal equivalence class [g] of the metric g on m . (our treatment in this paper is
purely formal, and we will thus neglect conformal anomalies such as the one discussed in [1].) actually,
[g] only appears in (2) through the hodge duality operator  that maps the space

 = {(2k + 1)  forms on m },

(7)

of which the eld strength h is an element, to itself. we note that the parameter q in the observable
(1) is also an element of .

to describe how to separate the non-chiral correlation function (4) into its chiral and anti-chiral parts,
we will actually have to assume that the metric g (and thus the conformal structure [g]) of m has a
euclidean signature. the hodge duality operator  then obeys   = 1, and can thus be thought of
as dening a complex structure j on the space  dened in (7). the moduli space j of all complex
structures on  itself carries a natural complex structure. it is easy to show that the map described
above from the moduli space g of conformal structures on m to j is injective, but not surjective. as
far as we know, the image of this map, which can thus be identied with g, does not carry a canonical
complex structure.

here it is in place to make some comments on the much-studied case d = 2, which has some additional
simplifying features. in this dimension, the space  is simply the cotangent space, and it is well-known
that a choice of a euclidean conformal structure [g] on m induces a complex structure not only on  but
on m itself. furthermore, the moduli space j of such complex structures is nite-dimensional. however,
these special properties are not necessary for our discussion, and in the sequel we will consider the general
case of d = 4k + 2 for arbitrary k.

to describe the complex structure j on the space  of (2k + 1)-forms on m more concretely, we begin
by noting that  carries a natural symplectic structure. the symplectic product is simply given by the
wedge product followed by integration over m . we can choose a basis (ea)i and (eb)i of  that is
symplectic in the sense that

zm
zm

(ea)i  (ea)j = zm
(eb)i  (ea)j = zm

(eb)i  (eb)j = 0

(ea)i  (eb)j = ij .

(8)

henceforth we will use a more compact notation where the basis elements (ea)i and (eb)j are assembled
into two (innite dimensional) column vectors ea and eb. the above conditions can then be written as

ea  et

eb  et

eb  et

b = 0

zm
zm

a = zm
a = zm

ea  et

b = 1,

(9)

where the 1 on the right hand side of the second equation denotes the unit matrix and t denotes the
transpose. an analogous notation will be employed for other spaces throughout this paper. an element
of , such as the eld strength h, can be expanded in this basis as

h = h t

aea + h t

beb

(10)

4

with some coecient vectors ha and hb. the same of course applies to the (2k + 1)-form q that enters
in the observable (1).

sofar, everything has been independent of the hodge duality operator . for a generic choice of ,
the entries of any two of the vectors ea, eb, ea, and eb span . we can for example expand eb as
a linear combination of ea and ea, i.e.

eb = xea + y ea.

(11)

one can show that the real coecient matrices x and y are symmetric, and with a suitable choice of
ea and eb (subject to the relations above), y is positive denite. the hodge duality operator , and
thus the complex structure j on , is completely determined by x and y , which thus can be regarded
as coordinates on the moduli space j of complex structures on . the complex structure on j can be
described by declaring that the complex linear combination

is a holomorphic coordinate on j . according to the above, it fullls the conditions

z = x + iy

z = z t
im z > 0.

(12)

(13)

it is often convenient to change basis for  from ea and eb to a holomorphic and anti-holomorphic

basis e+ and e dened as

e+ = (z  z)1(eb  zea)
e = (z  z)1(eb  zea).

(14)

which fulll e+ = +ie+ and e = ie. we can then expand for example the eld strength h (or
the parameter q) as

h = h t

+e+ + h t

e,

where the coecient vectors h+ and h are related to ha and hb as

h+ = ha + zhb
h = ha + zhb.

2.2 holomorphicity of hw (q)i+

(15)

(16)

we will now describe a criterion for distinguishing between the contributions to the correlation functions
from a chiral and an anti-chiral gauge eld.

with the notation introduce above, we can write the action (2) as

s =

4i
g2 (ha + zhb)t(z  z)1(ha + zhb).

(17)

remembering that ha and hb are independent of z, we nd that under an innitesimal anti-holomorphic
variation  z,

s =

4i
g2 (ha + zhb)t(z  z)1 z(z  z)1(ha + zhb).

(18)

5

since the observable (1) is independent of z we then get, by dierentiating under the integration sign
in (4) that  hw (q)i =  hw (q)si. for a chiral gauge eld, h+ = ha + zhb is zero, and the above
expression for s would thus vanish identically.
it is then natural to conjecture that the correlation
function for such a theory should be holomorphic, i.e.


 z

hw (q)i+ = 0.

(19)

similarly, the correlation function hw (q)i of an anti-chiral gauge eld should be anti-holomorphic. the
requirement that the non-chiral correlation function hw (q)i in (6) can be holomorphically factorized in
this manner is a non-trivial constraint, that we will verify in the remainder of this paper. (in fact, we
will see that this is only true if certain non-holomorphic anomalous factors are discarded.) in d = 2
dimensions, such a holomorphic factorization is an important and well-known feature of many conformal
eld theories, e.g. wess-zumino-witten models and cosets thereof [4].

2.3 classical and quantum contributions

we can decompose the space  of (2k + 1)-forms as

 = 0  ,

(20)

where 0 is the (nite-dimensional) subspace of harmonic forms, and  its orthogonal complement (with
respect to the symplectic metric). the hodge duality operator  respects this decomposition. the eld
strength h and the parameter q of the observable (1) can accordingly be decomposed as

h = h 0 + h 
q = q0 + q.

(21)

by the hodge-de rham theorem, h 0 is then the unique harmonic representative of the cohomology class
[h] of h, whereas h  = db  for some globally dened 2k-form b . in view of (3), it is natural to regard
h  as a quantum uctuation around a classical eld conguration h 0. inserting (21) into the formulas
(2) and (1), we then get s = s 0 + s  and w (q) = w (q0)w (q), where

s 0 = 

s  = 

and

h 0  h 0

h   h 

w (q0) = exp 4izm
w (q) = exp 4izm

h 0  q0

h   q.

(22)

(23)

in this way, we get hw (q)i = (cid:10)w (q0)(cid:11) hw (q)i, where the classical and quantum contributions are

given by

and

w (q0)es0

(cid:10)w (q0)(cid:11) =xh 0
hw (q)i =z db w (q)es

(24)

(25)

respectively. the sum in the classical part is over harmonic (2k + 1)-forms h 0 with integer periods, and
the functional integral in the quantum part is over globally dened (2k)-forms b  modulo closed forms
with integer periods.

3 the classical contribution

3.1 the poisson resummation

1

the classical eld strength h 0 belongs to the lattice   0 of harmonic (2k + 1)-forms with integer
periods. we now introduce a basis e 0
b for this lattice, which is symplectic in the same sense
as ea and eb in (8). a dierence is of course that e 0
b are nite dimensional vectors with
2 b2k+1 = 1
2 dimh2k+1(m, r) entries each. by a reasoning exactly analogous to that in the paragraph
following (10), we see that the hodge duality operator  induces a conformal structure j 0 parametrized
by z 0 = x 0 + iy 0 on the space 0 of harmonic (2k + 1)-forms. we can then also introduce the
corresponding holomorphic and anti-holomorphic basis e 0

a and e 0

a and e 0

 of 0.

+ and e 0

the classical eld strength h 0 can now be expanded as

h 0 = h 0t
= h 0t

a e 0
+ e 0

a + h 0t
+ + h 0t

b e 0
b
 e 0
,

(26)

where the coecient vectors h 0
q0 of the observable parameter as

a and h 0

b have integer entries. similarly, we expand the harmonic part

q0 = q0t
= q0t

a e 0
+ e 0

a + q0t
+ + q0t

b e 0
b
 e 0
.

(27)

inserting these expansions in (22) - (24) and xing the coupling constant g at the particular value g = 1,
we get

a (y 0)1h 0

a + 2h 0t

a (y 0)1x 0h 0

b + h 0t

b (x 0(y 0)1x 0 + y 0)h 0

we now perform a poisson resummation, replacing the sum over h 0
integer entries. renaming the vector h 0

b as n, we then get

3.2 a digression on theta-functions

a and q0

b can be regarded as real coordinates on the space 0 of harmonic (2k + 1)-
the coecients q0
forms. we will be interested in the torus 0/ (the intermediate jacobian of the manifold m ), where 
is the lattice of forms with integer periods. this means that we should identify

q0

(31)

a and 0

for any vectors 0

b with integer entries. the natural complex structure on 0 means that 0/

(32)

the parameter z 0 obeys conditions analogous to (13), which implies that 0/ is an abelian variety [5].
it is endowed with a (principal) polarization given by the cohomology class [] of the symplectic form 
corresponding to the natural symplectic structure on 0.

consider now a unitary line bundle l over 0/ with a connection whose curvature equals . since
 is of type (1, 1), l is in fact a holomorphic line bundle. as a complex line bundle, l is determined
by its chern class c1(l) = [], but there is a ner classication of holomorphic line bundles [5]. indeed,
the kernel of the chern class c1 is isomorphic to the complex torus h 1(0/, o)/h 1(0/, z) (the
picard variety or the dual abelian variety), where o is the sheaf of holomorphic functions. the set of
holomorphic line bundles l with c1(l) = [] is thus also a torus, which we can parametrize by  and 
that are vectors of dimension 1
2 b2k+1 with entries with values in r/z. we denote the corresponding line
bundle as l[

 ].

it follows from an index theorem together with the kodaira vanishing theorem that l[

holomorphic section (up to a multiplicative constant). in a certain trivialization of l[
the jacobi theta-function

 ] has a unique
 ], this is given by

(cid:2)
(cid:3) (z 0|q0

+) =xk

exp i(cid:0)(k + )tz 0(k + ) + 2(k + )t(q0

+ + )(cid:1) ,

(33)

where the sum runs over vectors k of dimension 1
the quasi-periodicity conditions

2 b2k+1 with integer entries. the theta-function obeys

so in this trivialization, the transition functions are holomorphic c-valued functions. we will use a

its quasi-periodicity properties are

that k  l is a vector with even entries. the sums over k and l can then be exchanged to sums over the
vectors m and n with integer entries dened through the relations k = m + n and l = m  n. finally,
the sums over m and  can be exchanged to a sum over the vector m = 2(m + ), which yields (30).

we must now pick one of the terms in (37), i.e. a particular value of  and . the chiral part of the

4 the quantum contribution

the quantum part of the gauge eld is given by a globally dened (2k)-form b  modulo closed forms.
introducing a basis f in the space of such forms, we can then expand b  as

b  = btf

(40)

for some vector b of coecients. the exterior derivative d acting on f gives a vector df of exact (2k + 1)-
forms, which can be expressed in terms of the symplectic basis ea and eb or the holomorphic basis e+
and e:

df = = t

(41)

for some matrices a, b, + and  of coecients. the quantum part h  = db  of the eld strength
is then

and the quantum part of the action (22) is

aea + t

h  = bt(cid:0)t

beb(cid:1) ,

where the symmetric matrix k is given by

s  =

g2 btkb,

expanding the quantum part q of q in (21) as

k = t

+(cid:0)z  z(cid:1)1

.

q = qt

we get for the quantum part of the observable (23)

w (q) = exp 4ibtj,

where

j =(cid:0)t

(z  z)1q+(cid:1) .

we can now perform the gaussian path-integral over the b -eld in (25), i.e. over the coecients b, with
the result

hw (q)i  (det k)1/2 exp g2ij tk 1j.

(48)

for this formula to make sense, the matrix k in (44) must be invertible. if we furthermore assume that
the matrices + and + are also invertible, we can simplify further to get

where the chiral part is given by the holomorphic expression

hw (q)i+ = (det +)1/2 exp(i)qt

and the anti-chiral part by its complex conjugate whereas the anomalous prefactor is

hw (q)ianom =(cid:0)det(z  z)(cid:1)1/2

putting everything together, the nal answer for the chiral correlation function is thus

it remains to discuss the non-holomorphic factors (39) and (52). these must be discarded in order
for the non-chiral correlation function to admit a holomorphic factorization. to make sense of the

innite-dimensional determinant in (52), we can employ for example -function regularization. on a at
(4k + 2)-torus (generalizing the two-dimensional calculation in [6]), it turns out this determinant cancels
the nite-dimensional determinant in (39). it would be interesting to know if this is true also in more
general situations. the remaining factor in (52) is in some sense a contact term since it does not involve
the derivative matrices + and .
