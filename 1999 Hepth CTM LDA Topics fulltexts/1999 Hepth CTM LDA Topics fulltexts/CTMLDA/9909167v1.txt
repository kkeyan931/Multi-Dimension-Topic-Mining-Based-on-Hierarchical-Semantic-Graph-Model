abstract

interaction of branes in presence of internal gauge elds is considered by using the

boundary state formalism . this approach enables us to consider the problems that

are not easily accessible to the canonical approach via open strings . the eects of

compactication of some of the dimensions on tori are also discussed . also we study

the massless state contribution on this interaction .

1 introduction

dp-branes with non zero back ground internal gauge elds, or equivalently d-branes in b
elds and u(1) gauge elds a have shown several interesting properties [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
on the one hand they describe bound states of dp and dp2-branes [4] or dp-branes and
fundamental strings [3] and on the other hand they give rise to sym theories on a non

commutative space [9] . also the study of the physics of (n,1) bound states [5, 6], creation

of fundamental string between d4-branes [7], loop corrections to superstring equations of
motion [8], scattering of closed strings from d-branes [1] and dynamics and interactions of

d-brane solitons [2] are another applications of dp-branes in non zero back ground gauge
elds . a useful tool for describing dp-branes and their interactions (specially in non zero
back ground gauge elds) is the boundary state formalism [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] . simply

the overlap of boundary states through the closed string propagator give us the amplitude

of interaction of branes . by introducing back ground elds b and a u(1) gauge eld a
(which lives in d-brane) to the string -model action one obtains mixed boundary conditions

for the strings emitted by the branes . the method of boundary states enables us to study

the interaction of branes with dierent dimensions and dierent internal elds some of which

are not easily accessible by canonical formalism [4].

we shall also consider compactication of certain dimensions on tori . the states emitted

from the branes which are wrapped around compact directions with internal back ground

elds turn out to be dominantly along a certain direction not perpendicular to the brane

which specied by its windings . these windings, around the compact directions are corre-

lated with their momenta along the brane . this is in contrast to the case of pure d-brane

where the closed strings only have momentum perpendicular to the brane .

in section 2 we write and solve the equations of boundary states . in section 3 we use

the result of section 2 to calculate the interaction of two branes of arbitrary dimensions p1
and p2 with dierent internal f elds. we also nd the result when part of the space is
compactied on a torus. we shall also show that our result reduces to that of the known
cases such as zero f elds, and non-compact spacetime . finally the contribution of the
massless states on the amplitude is extracted and thus interaction strength is be obtained .

since compactication eects on the interaction of the branes do not depend on the

fermions, we will consider only the bosonic string . in this article we denote a brane in the

back-ground of internal elds by mp -brane, i.e. a mixed brane with dimension p.

we begin with a -model action containing b eld and two boundary terms [16] corre-
sponding to the two mp1 and mp2-branes gauge elds .

()2 are two boundaries of this world sheet, which are at  = 0 and  = 0 respectively .
a(1)
2 are u(1) gauge elds that live in mp1 and mp2-branes . the sets {1} and {2}
specify the directions on the mp1 and mp2-world branes . g and b are usual back-ground
elds . vanishing the variation of this action with respect to x (,  ) gives the equation of
motion of x (,  ) and boundary state equations.

taking the b(x) and g(x) to be constant elds, thus the boundary states equations

become

total eld strengths are

f(2)22 = b22  a(2)

[1,1]
[2,2].

furthermore if we take mp1 and mp2-branes to be at positions {yi1
we have to impose

the compact directions, in which

momenta in such directions we have

imposing the boundary conditions on the solution (5) as operator equation, we obtain the

boundary state equations that, for the second brane take the form

(11)

(12)

where 0 is the  variable on the boundary of the closed string world sheet. if the direction
x i2 is non-compact we have li2 = 0, and if this direction is compact then equation (12)
implies that li2 = 0 , i.e. the closed string cannot wind around directions perpendicular to

the brane . equation (8) also implies that the closed string can have a momentum in the

world brane directions . this is in contrast to the non compact case where the momentum

components along the brane directions are zero . as equation (8) shows the momentum and

the windings of the emitted string are proportional . physically it means that when the back
ground f is turned on and brane is wrapped around the compact directions, the closed string
that is emitted (absorbed) from (by) the brane must have its momentum in one direction

of brane proportional to its winding numbers in the other compact directions of brane .

according to this equation, closed string momentum components along both compact and

non compact directions of the brane is quantized. it is rather surprising that the internal

4

momentum even in non compact directions of the brane is non zero and quantized . it is

worth noting that although this momentum is non zero, it is not an independent quantum

number. this is the eect of internal gauge elds and compactication. for the compact
directions of brane also we have quantized momenta pc = m c

(13)

(14)

as m c and n c are integers we can look at this relation as a constraint on the ux allowing
a closed string with momentum numbers {m c} and winding numbers {n c} . m c and
n c being integers restrict  1
c to be rational . on the other hand for a given ux
the relation between momentum numbers and winding numbers of closed strings species
which string lives in | bi and can be emitted. similar eect for the open strings ending on
the branes is observed [9] .

the constant tp2 is the tension of dp2-brane and is derived in [1] and [14]. the origin of the
factor qdet(1  f2) is in the path integral with boundary action [8, 17, 18] . the ghost part
of boundary state is independent of f2 and is given by the same expression as for f2 = 0

3 interaction between two mixed branes

now we can calculate the overlap of the two boundary states to obtain the interaction

amplitude of branes. as compactication eects do not depend on fermions and superghosts

therefore we discuss only on the bosonic case . complete boundary state is

| bi =| bxi | bghi

(25)

these two mixed branes simply interact via exchange of closed strings, so that the amplitude

is given by

where d is the closed string propagator [11]. the calculation is straight forward but

a = hb1 | d | b2, 0 = 0i

exchange of indices 1 and 2 (see (26)). although in this article we are dealing only

with bosonic string, it is wroth noting that similar consideration concerning the eects of

compactication works for the superstring case since these eects are independent of the

fermions .

we can write this amplitude in another form in which common world volume of the world
branes explicitly appears . in the sum over {n uc} one term is obtained for n uc = 0 for all uc,
therefore pu

remainder part with the change in  i .

spacetime with dimension d . in this case vu is vp+1 . furthermore consider f1 = f2  f ,

2(d10)/4 (42)(d2p4)/4 after a transformation t  /2t, equation (30) can
then for tp =
be interpreted as the one-loop free energy of an open string whose ends are xed on these

parallel branes [20] .

the formula (27) reduces to the previous known results on the interaction of mixed

branes, for example those considered in [3, 4] .

in the previous methods each particular

relative conguration of two branes needs to be treated individually, which may or may not

yield to the canonical quantization. in contrast, the method of boundary state can be used

for any two arbitrary branes. there is also another advantage in the boundary state method
. in the canonical method when the magnetic part of f is dierent from zero, the space
becomes non commutative . in the present method we can go around this problem and all

cases can be handled in the same way . in the following we consider an example using the

general formula .

example:
consider two parallel m2-branes along (x 1, x 2), with non zero components of elds
f(1) 01 = e and f(2) 01 = e . in this case non zero components of momenta along the world
volume are p0
 ner1, where n is winding number of a given closed
string states around the x 1-direction . therefore the interaction amplitude becomes

for distant branes only massless states have a considerable contribution on the amplitude.

therefore we will restrict our attention to the long-range force. we know that the metric,

antisymmetric tensor and dilaton states have zero winding numbers and zero momentum

numbers, therefore from the general expression of the interaction amplitude (27), only the
term with n uc = 0 ( for all uc ) corresponds to this three massless states . we also must

note that result (35) can also be obtained by projecting the boundary states onto the
massless levels . performing this projection on boundary state | b2i, the metric and the

mentum and zero winding numbers . by inserting the closed string propagator between | s1i
(which lives in | b1i ) and | s2i, again we obtain the result (35) .

5 conclusion

we explicitly obtained boundary state for mixed boundary conditions on closed string and

developed the corresponding formalism to extract the amplitude and the contribution of the

massless states on it, in presence of non zero back-ground b and internal gauge elds .

the formalism was applied to both compact and non compact spacetime . in the space

with compactication strong relation holds among internal windings and momenta restricting

the total ux passing through the branes, or for a given ux restricting the windings and

momenta of closed string. only when the ratio of dierent total internal uxes are fractional

the winding modes of boundary states can have contribution to the interaction , since they

can only emitted and absorbed with certain angles restricted by those uxes .

the formalism can be extended to include fermionic degrees of freedom and hence can

be applied to the superstring. this work is in progress.
