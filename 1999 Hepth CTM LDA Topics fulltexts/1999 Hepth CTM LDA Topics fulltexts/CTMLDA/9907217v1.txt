abstract

using purely hamiltonian methods we derive a simple dierential

equation for the generator of the most general local symmetry trans-

formation of a lagrangian. the restrictions on the gauge parameters

found by earlier approaches are easily reproduced from this equation.

we also discuss the connection with the purely lagrangian approach.

the general considerations are applied to the yang-mills theory.

the problem of nding the most general local symmetries of a lagrangian

has been pursued by various authors, using either lagrangian [1, 2, 3, 4] or

hamiltonian techniques [5, 6, 7]. nevertheless a compact equation which

determines the precise structure of the generator of gauge transformations,

which are the symmetries of a lagrangian, is still lacking.

in a recent paper [8] we had shown that the requirement of commuta-

tivity of the time derivative operation with an arbitrary innitesimal gauge

transformation generated by the rst class constraints was the only input

needed for obtaining the restrictions on the gauge parameters entering the

most general form of the generator g. the analysis was performed entirely

in the hamiltonian framework.

following essentially the same commutativity requirement, we derive here,

in a hamiltonian framework, a simple dierential equation for the genera-

tor. this dierential equation encodes, in particular, the restrictions on the

gauge parameters. we explicitly demonstrate that this equation implies the

(o shell) invariance of the action under the transformation generated by g,

and ensures the covariance of the hamilton equations of motion.

in this paper we shall consider purely rst class systems. the extension to

mixed rst and second class systems is straightforward. to keep the algebra

simple, and also for reasons of comparison, we assume all constraints to be

irreducible.

we consider a hamiltonian system whose dynamics is described by the

total hamiltonian

ht = hc +xa1

va1a1 .

(1)

where hc is the canonical hamiltonian, {a1  0} are the (rst class) primary

constraints, and va1 are the associated lagrange multipliers. we denote the

complete set of (primary and secondary) constraints 4 by {a} = {a1, a2}.

4secondary refers to all generations of constraints beyond the primary one.

2

the poisson algebra of the constraints with themselves and with the canonical

hamiltonian, is of the form

[hc, a] = v b

a b

[a, b] = c c

abc

(2)

(3)

where v b

a and c c

ab may be functions of the phase-space variables. consider

an innitesimal transformation on the coordinates generated by g,

with

qi = [qi, g] ,

aa

g = xa

(4)

(5)

where, following diracs conjecture [9], the sum includes all of the rst class

constraints. the gauge parameters are allowed to depend in general on time,

as well as on the phase space variables and lagrange multipliers.

in (4) we have chosen to include the gauge parameters a inside the

bracket. the dierence between (4) and the variation qi computed with

the parameters outside the bracket is proportional to the constraints. such

terms can always be be written in the form ij

s
qj

, with ij = ji, which

correspond to trivial gauge transformations [5]. in this paper we are only

considering gauge transformations, modulo these trivial gauge transforma-

tions.

consider the rst of hamiltons equations, giving the connection between

the velocities and the momenta

dqi
dt

 [qi, ht ]

(6)

where  stands for weak equality in the sense of dirac [9]. from above

we obtain

d
dt

qi  [[qi, g], ht ] + [qi,


t

g] ,

(7)

3

and



dqi
dt

 [[qi, ht ], g] .

(8)

where we have taken account of the fact that g will in general depend exlicitly

on the time. implementing the commutativity requirement [8]

d
dt

qi = 

d
dt

qi

(9)

by equating the last two expressions, and using the jacobi identity, we arrive

at the condition

[qi,


t

g + [g, ht ]]  0

(10)

using the ansatz (5) as well as the algebra given in eqs.

(2) and (3), it

follows that 

t g + [g, ht ] is given by a linear combination of the rst class

constraints:


t

g + [g, ht ] = xa

aa .

substituting this expression into (10), we arrive at the condition

a 
pi

a  0 .

(11)

(12)

now, the rst class nature and linear independence (irreducibility) of the

constraints guarantees that each of these can be identied as a momentum

conjugate to some coordinate, the precise mapping being eected by a canon-

ical transformation [2]. since (12) holds for all i one is led to the condition

a  0. therefore the r.h.s of (11) will be proportional to the square of the

constraints, so that, within the hamiltonian formalism, we are allowed to set

the l.h.s of (11) strongly equal to zero:


t

g + [g, ht ] = 0 .

(13)

this is the fundamental equation determining g, which we henceforth refer

to as the master equation. as we shall see, it will guarantee the (o-shell)

invariance of the total action.

4

the condition (13) also ensures the covariance of the hamilton equations

of motion under a transformation generated by g. thus consider the equa-

tion of motion for qi:

dqi
dt

 [qi, ht (q, p, v)] .

(14)

consider further the gauge-transfomed phase space variables and lagrange

multipliers

with

qi = qi + qi ,

pi = pi + pi ,

va1 = va1 + va1

qi = [qi, g] ,

pi = [pi, g] ,

va1 = [va1, g] .

using the equations of motion (14), the master equation (13) as well as (7)

one readily veries that

dqi
dt

 [qi, ht (q, p, v)] ,

which demonstrates the covariance. a similar statement holds for pi.

we now examine the implications of our condition (13) for the gauge

parameters in (5). making use of the algebra (2) and (3), the master equation

(13) is easily seen to lead to


t

g + [g, ht ] = (cid:16) db

dt

 a[v b

a + va1c b

a1a](cid:17)b  va1a1 = 0 .

from here we obtain the following conditions

vb1 =

0 =

db1
dt
db2
dt

 a[v b1

a + va1c b1

a1a] ,

 a[v b2

a + va1c b2

a1a] .

(15)

(16)

(17)

note that in the above equations, da

dt denotes the total time derivative as

given by

da
dt

=

da
dt

+ [a, hc] + va1[a, a1]

where, following the notation of ref. [5],

d
dt

=


t

+ va1 
va1

+ va1 
 va1

+   .

5

(18)

(19)

with an overdot denoting the derivative with respect to the explicit depen-

dence in time. the same conditions have been obtained in ref. [5] by looking

at the invariance of the gauge-xed extended action, and directly from the

commutativity requirement (9) in ref.

[8]. note that equation (16) only

plays a role in the hamiltonian formulation where the equations of motion

are obtained from the variation of the total action. for the extraction of the

symmetries of the original lagrangian the relevant equation is (17).

it is clear that the above considerations can be easily extended to the

case where the dynamics is described by the extended hamiltonian he =

ht + va2a2. the commutativity requirement will now lead to the extended

master equation


t

g + [g, he] = 0 .

(20)

in this case no restrictions on the gauge parameters are implied by eq. (20),

which only determines the transformation law for the multipliers va:

(cid:16) db

dt

 a[v b

a + vcc b

ca](cid:17)  vb = 0 .

(21)

this equation was obtained in ref. [5] by directly looking at the invariance

of the extended action. furthermore, by imposing gauge conditions imple-

menting {va2 = 0} [5], one recovers (16) and (17), as is evident from (20).

returning to our formulation in terms of the total hamiltonian, the rst

step for obtaining the nal form for g consists in solving equation (17) for the

a2s in terms of the coordinates, momenta, lagrange multiplieres (including

their time derivatives) and a set of independent parameters whose number

equals the number of primary constraints. these parameters can be taken

to be a function of time only. a method for solving these equations has been

given in [5]. the nal step consists in computing the variations (4), and in

eliminating the canonical momenta and the lagrange multipliers in terms

of the coordinates and velocities using the rst of the hamilton equations

of motion.

in particular the multipliers are eliminated by making use of

6

the hamilton equations for the variables which are conjugate to the primary

constraints. in fact equation (16) is just a consistency condition of the entire

scheme, as we now show.

the primary constraints can always be expressed in the form [1]

a1 = pa1  fa1({qa}, {pa2}) ,

(22)

where qa1, pa1 are canonically conjugate pairs of variables, with { qa1} the

(arbitrary) non projectible velocities. taking the variation of

dqa1
dt

 [qa1, hc] + [qa1, b1]vb1

(23)

we have



dqa1
dt

 [qa1, hc] + [qa1, b1]vb1 + [qa1, b1]vb1 .

(24)

using (9) we obtain for the l.h.s,



dqa1
dt

=

d
dt

qa1 

da
dt

[qa1 , a] + a ([[qa1 , a], hc] + [[qa1, a], c1]vc1) . (25)

making use of the jacobi identity as well as of (17) , one readily nds

 vb1 

db1
dt

+ a[v b1

a + va1c b1

a1a]! [qa1, b1]  0 .

(26)

recalling (22), and noting that the gauge transformations are dened only

modulo the trivial ones, we make use of this freedom in order to obtain from

(26) the strong relations (16).

to make contact with previous literature, we recall the conditions given

in ref.[10, 11], 5

[hc, g] 

g
t

= ha1a1

[a, b1] = c c1

ab1c1 .

(27)

(28)

where g is of course always understood to be rst-class. as was however

emphasized in ref [5], the second condition is restrictive. indeed, if we take

5in ref. [10], eq.(28) was given in the form [g, a1 ] = gb1

a1b1 .

7

equations (28) together with the ansatz (5) as our starting point, we are led

to

0 =

db2
dt

 av b2
a

.

(29)

as the only condition. note that this condition follows from our general

relations (16) and (17), since the structure functions c b2

a1,a are assumed to

be zero, as implied by assumption (28). note also that our rst relation is

absent since their conditions do not involve any lagrange multipliers.

we now want to make contact with the purely lagrangian methods of

obtaining the gauge symmetries [1, 2, 3, 4]. as discussed by dirac [9], the

classical euler-lagrange equations follow from the action principle st = 0,

where st is dened by

st = z dt[pi qi  ht ] .

(30)

we now show that the condition (13) does indeed ensure the invariance of

the total action under the transformations generated by g. consider lt =

pi qi  ht . assuming the commutativity (9), we nd for an innitesimal

transformation generated by g

lt = [pi, g] qi  pi[qi, g]  [ht , g] +

d
dt

(piqi)

=


t

g + [g, ht ] +

d
dt

(g + piqi) .

(31)

since the endpoint congurations in the total action (30) are taken to be

xed, we see that the invariance of the total action under this transformation

leads to the o-shell condition (13). observe that no use has been made of

the equations of motion.

the general variation of the lagrangian l(q, q) is given by

l = liqi +

d

dt(cid:16) l

 qi

qi(cid:17)

where li is the euler derivative, given in terms of the hessian wij by

li = wij qj +

2l
qj qi qj 

l
qi

8

(32)

(33)

note that liqi in the present formulation corresponds to 

t g + [g, ht ] 

d

dt g in the formulation in terms of the total action. both expressions vanish

on shell.

it is well known [1, 2, 3, 4] that to each gauge symmetry of the lagrangian

there is a corresponding gauge identity having the general form

a1 = xk

dk
dtk (i

(k)a1(q, q)li)  0

taking a general gauge transformation of the form [2] 6

(1)k dka1(t)

dtk

i
(k)a1(q, q)

qi = xk,a1

(34)

(35)

where a1(t) are the gauge parameters, one nds that the variation of the

lagrangian is given by

l = a1 a1 +   

(36)

where the dots stand for a contribution given by a total time derivative,

which does not contribute to the variation of the action. because of the gauge

identities the action is invariant. the corresponding statement in the case of

the total action (30) is that, once the equations (17) are solved, the master

equation (13) is satised identically without making use of the equations of

motion. from the above point of view the diculty in solving the eqs. (17)

manifests itself in the problem of nding the zero modes of the hessian, from

which the functions i

(k)a1 in (34) are determined.

the number of gauge identities is equal to the number of independent

gauge parameters. this also coincides with the number of rst class primary

constraints. thus, for hamiltonian systems involving only such constraints,

there are no restrictions on the parameters parametrizing the gauge gen-

erators (5). an important class of systems having this property are the

so called zero-hamiltonian systems where hc  0, which characterizes

6the form of qi as given by (35) is also suggested within the hamiltonian framework

by the work of ref. [5], with a1 playing the role of the independent gauge parameters.

9

reparametrization invariant theories. in that case the dynamics is described

by ht = p va1a1, where the sum extends only over the pimary rst class

constraints. the dirac algorithm ensures that these are in fact the only rst

class constraints. hence the gauge generator is described entirely in terms

of these constraints. as a result we obtain only relations (16), and there are

no restrictions on the innitesimal gauge parameters.

for some physically interesting models, the structure functions v a

b and

c c

a,b are actually constants, and the gauge parameters are just functions of

t.

in the case where c c

ab = 0 and the v a

b s are constant, equations (17)

have been solved in ref. [12]. it leads to variations in the coordinates which

coincide with the general form given (35).

an example where the v a

b depend on the coordinates is given by the pure

yang-mills lagrangian,

l = 

1
4

f a f a

 .

this is a purely rst class system with one primary constraint

a
0(x)  0

and one secondary constraint

[dii]a(x) = ia

i (x) + fabcab

i(x)c

i (x)  0 .

the canonical hamiltonian is given by

hc = z d3xh 1

2

(~a)2 +

1
4

(f a

ij)2 + aa

0(dii)ai

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

from this expression one readily nds that the non-vanishing structure func-

tions analogous to those in (2) and (3) are given by 7

(v 2

1 (x, y))ab = (x  y)ab

;

(v 2

2 (x, y))ab = gfacba0c(x  y)

(c 2

22(x, y, z))abc = gfabc(x  y)(y  z)

(41)

(42)

7the index 1 and 2 refer to the primary and secondary constraint, respectively.

10

hence in the case of the pure yang-mills theory (17) reduces to

0a

2(x) = a

1(x) + gfacba0b(x)c

2(x)

(43)

taking a

2(x) = a(x) as the independent gauge parameters and solving the

above equation for a

1 leads to the following structure of the gauge generator

g(x) = (d0)a(x)a

0 (x) + (dii)a(x)a(x)

(44)

from this we immediately obtain for the innitessimal gauge transforma-

tions of the potentials the familiar result,

aa

(x) = z d3y[aa

(x), g(y)] = (d)a(x) .

(45)

we can also compute the variation of the multiplier by using the rst of

the hamilton equations to obtain the relation aa

0 = va, and then using the

commutativity analogous to (9). the result is,

va = 0aa

0 = 0(d0)a .

(46)

the same equation also follows directly from (16) with the identication

b1  a

1(x) = [d0(x)]a.

to complete our discussion we now reproduce the lagrangian gauge iden-

tities following from our hamiltonian analysis. it is easy to see that the vari-

ation (45) can be cast into the form of (35) with k taking the values k = 0, 1,

where a1(t) are identied with with the gauge parameters a(x), and

0a
(0)b(x, y) = gfacba0c3(x  y)

0a
(1)b(x, y) = ab3(x  y)

ia
(0)b(x, y) = di

ab3(x  y) .

using these expressions in (34), we arrive at

a(x)  (dl)a(x) = 0

11

(47)

(48)

where l is the euler derivative, which in the present case is given by df.

we have thus arrived at the standard gauge identity of the yang-mills la-

grangian.

to conclude, we wish to emphasize once more the main points of our

paper. we have derived for the most general case a master equation in the

hamiltonian formalism, which expresses the time independence of the gen-

erator of gauge transformations, and compactly encodes a pair of equations

giving the restrictions on the gauge parameters, as well as the variations of

the lagrange multipliers. we have further explicitly demonstrated the con-

sistency of this pair of equations with hamiltons equations of motion. the

commutativity requirement (9) played a key role in the whole analysis. ob-

serve that in a lagrangian framework this commutativity is always used when

deriving the equations of motion, or obtaining the gauge symmetries, while

on the hamiltonian level it implies non-trivial restrictions on the gauge pa-

rameters. the master equation was also shown to imply the invariance of the

total action, as well as the convariance of the hamilton equations of motion.

we further discussed the connection with the purely lagrangian approach.

in particular we established a correspondance between the gauge identities

and the master equation, which vanishes identically when expressed in terms

of the free parameters.

we have discussed here systems involving only rst class constraints. the

extension to mixed systems can be done in two distinct ways.

i) the con-

ventional way would consist in replacing everywhere the poisson brackets by

the corresponding dirac brackets.

ii) an alternative procedure would con-

sist in embedding the original theory into a pure rst class theory following

the procedure of reference [13], and then to follow the steps given here. in

particular, purely second class systems could also be treated in this way.
