abstract

bilocal lightray operators which are lorentz scalars, vectors or antisym-
metric tensors, and which appear in various hard qcd scattering processes,
are decomposed into operators of denite twist. these operators are har-
monic tensor functions and their taylor expansion consists of (traceless)
local lightcone operators which span irreducible representations of the
lorentz group with denite spin j and common (geometric) twist (= dimen-
sion  spin). some applications concerning the nonforward matrix elements
of these operators and the generalization to conformal lightcone operators
of denite twist is considered. the group theoretical background of the
method has been made clear.

1 introduction

for many hard scattering processes in qcd the nonlocal lightcone(lc) expan-
sion, together with the renormalization group equation, is a powerful tool to
determine the dependence of the nonperturbative partition amplitudes on the
experimentally relevant momentum transfer q2. this is the case for, e.g., the
parton distributions in deep inelastic scattering (dis), the pion as well as vector
meson wave functions and, as growing up more recently, the nonforward distri-
bution amplitudes in deeply virtual compton scattering (dvcs). any of these
phenomenological quantities are related to the to the compton amplitude for
nonforward scattering a virtual photon o a hadron which is given by

t(p+, p, q) = iz d4x eiqx hp2, s2 |t (j(x/2)j(x/2))| p1, s1i,

(1.1)

where p+ = p2 + p1, p = p2  p1 = q1  q2, q = (q1 + q2)/2 are the kinematical
independent variables. to specify the asymptotics of virtual compton scattering
the generalized bjorken region will be dened as follows

 = qp+  ,

q2 = q2  

(1.2)

1  q2

with the two independent scaling variables  = q2/qp+ and  = qp/qp+ =
(q2
2)/2, to be held xed by the experimental setup. these variables which
are not restricted to the intervall [1, +1] are obvious modications of the usual
bjorken variable and the skewedness parameter.1

the (renormalized) timeordered product in eq. (1.1) can be represented in
terms of the nonlocal operator product expansion [2, 3, 25], which directly leads
to compact expressions for the coecient functions and the corresponding bilo-
cal lcoperators.
it is essential to remark that all the interesting nonpertur-
bative partition amplitudes which appear in the above mentioned processes are
fourier transforms of various matrix elements whose unique input are one and
the same lightray operators. furthermore, all the interesting evolution equations
of these partition amplitudes result from the renormalization group equation of
the involved lightray operators and, consequently, their evolution kernels can be
determined from the anomalous dimension of these operators. so many of the
physical properties which result in dierent experimental situations have a com-
mon quantum eld theoretical origin which is traced back to the properties of the
lcoperators.

with the growing accuracy of the experimental data a perturbative expansion
with respect to the experimentally relevant variable, m 2/q2, m being a typical
mass of the process, will be very useful. however, these contributions could be
of quite dierent origin. on the one hand, they result from a decomposition of
the bilocal lightray operators  in lowest order only quark operators with two

1 instead of this parametrization, despite being quite natural from a general point of view,

for various physical situations others may be prefered (see, e.g., [20, 28, 19, 15]).

2

external legs occure  into operators of denite twist. in addition there appear
higher loop contributions of physical matrix elements for the same operators.

unfortunately, the notion of twist is unambigously dened in leading order
only. its original denition, as has been introduced by gross and treiman [14] for
the local operators, twist ( ) = dimension (d)  spin (j), is directly related to the
irreducible tensor representations of the orthochronous lorentz group and, with
respect to this, is a lorentz invariant notion (geometric twist).

later on, various authors used the well known lcquantization in the in-
nite momentum frame [22] together with the decomposition of the quark elds
into good and bad components,  = + + , with  = 1
2 , in order
to introduce another notion of twist: as has been pointed out in [18], a bad
component introduces one unit of m/q because these components are not dy-
namically independent and may be expressed through the equations of motion by
the good ones times the above kinematical factor. despite being conceptionally
dierent this denition looks similar to the phenomenologically more convenient
one which counts only powers of 1/q in the innite momentum frame [18].

however, both these powercounting concepts of dynamical twist, despite
being phenomenological quite useful, have serious theoretical drewbacks: first,
they are not lorentz invariant and, therefore, can not coincide with the original
geometric denition. furthermore, the same power of 1/q may occure for dierent
values of  .
in addition, this concept is applicable only for matrix elements of
operators and not directly related to the operators itself. moreover, if the matrix
elements contain more than one momentum, as will be the case for dvcs, the
denition of the scaling variables is somewhat ambiguous and dierent denitions
are related by power series in m 2/q2 thereby changing the decomposition with
respect to dynamical twist.

therefore, from the point of view of renormalized quantum eld theory we
should state: only the original geometric denition of twist is a well-dened con-
cept. but then the problem occurs how to generalize it to the nonlocal operators
which appear in the nonlocal lightcone expansion.

let us shortly introduce the basic concepts of the nonlocal lightcone expan-
sion and show how it is related to its local version. the rigorous proof of the
nonlocal lce was given in [2] where, rst of all, an operator identity for the
product of two composite operators  e.g. the (time ordered) product of the two
currents in eq. (1.1)  has been proven (in scalar eld theory) which holds on the
whole hilbert space. then, using a special, lightcone adapted renormalization
procedure r it was shown that the perturbative functional of the renormalized
product of two currents may be split into an asymptotically relevant part  the
lightcone expansion up to a nite order of lightcone singularity  and a well
dened remainder being less singular:

rt(cid:0)j(x/2)j(x/2)s(cid:1)  z +1

1

d2 c(x2, ; 2)rt(cid:0)o(1x, 2x)s(cid:1) (1.3)

+ higher order terms.

3

here, the (unrenormalized) lightray operators are given by

o(1x, 2x) = : (1 x)u(1 x, 2x)(2 x) : ,

with some specied structure and with the usual phase factor

u(1, 2)  u(1 x, 2x) = p exp(cid:26)igz 1

2

d xa( x)(cid:27) ,

(1.4)

(1.5)

where p denotes the path ordering, g is the strong coupling parameter and a =
aa
ta is the gluon eld with ta being the generators of su(3)color in the fundamental
representation spanned by the quark elds . thereby, the lightlike vector

x = x +  (x/2)(cid:16)p1  x2 2/(x)2  1(cid:17)

(1.6)

is related to x and a xed nonnull subsidiary fourvector  whose dependence
drops out in physical expressions at leading order.2
in this approach the coef-
cient functions and the corresponding lightray operators naturally occure as
renormalized ones. in the following, for simplicity, we do not explicitly indicate
that they are renormalized quantities.

let us now point to the remarkable fact that, in principle, the nonlocal as well
as the usual local lightcone expansion may be obtained from (1.3) (for a detailed
consideration see [11]): the fourier transform f(x2, xpi; 2) of c(x2, i; 2) with
respect to i is an entire functions of the new arguments xpi [2]. therefore, the
range of i is restricted to 1  i  +1 and, in addition, f may be taylor
expanded with respect to xpi: this leads, instead of the integration in (1.3), to
a (twofold) innite sum over local operators. the local and nonlocal operators
are related through the following formulae:

(1.7)

(1.8)

o(1x, 2x) = xn1n2

n1
1
n1!

n2
2
n2!

o

n1n2(x),

o

n1n2(x) =

n1
n1
1

n2
n2
2

o(1 x, 2 x)(cid:12)(cid:12)1=2=0 .

this connection between the local and the nonlocal lcoperators is the key
relation which opens the possibility to generalize the geometric notion of twist,
being originally introduced for local operators, also to nonlocal ones. this is the
aim of the present paper which is essentially based on [24, 7]. at rst, a group
theoretical founded algorithm is presented which allows to obtain for any bilocal
operator a uniquely dened twist decomposition

o(1x, 2x) =

xmin

o

(1x, 2x).

(1.9)

2 it has to be noted that, because the lightcone expansion is considered for the operators and
not for their matrix elements, such a lightlike reference vector has necessarily to be introduced
in conguration space. however, if matrix elements are considered with some uniquely dened
momentum p, p 2 = m 2, then  = p/m may be chosen [5].

4

for general values of x this decomposition contains innitely many terms which
are harmonic tensor functions (depending on the external lorentz indices ).
in general, the contributions to a well-dened twist result from dierent indepen-
dent irreducible (local) tensor representations. by projecting onto the lightcone,
x  x, the above sum terminates at nite twist max. for the bilocal quark oper-
ators, which will be considered in detail, we obtain max = 4. for the vector and
(antisymmetric) tensor operators the trace terms which dene operators of higher
twist are proportional to x. their explicit form has been given here for the rst
time. of course, the method can be applied to the gluon operators; in principle,
also more complicated nonlocal operators may be considered.

the paper is organized as follows. section 2 is devoted to a short exposition
of the group theoretical background characterizing the irreducible tensor repre-
sentations of the lorentz group. section 3 contains our main results  the twist
decomposition of (pseudo) scalar, (axial) vector and antisymmetric tensor op-
erators. appendix a contains a short exposition about the characterization of
irreducible tensor representations through the young tableaux, and appendix b
introduces the notion of harmonic tensor functions which is relevant for our twist
decomposition.

2 irreducible tensor representations of the

lorentz group l

+  so(1, 3, r)

in this chapter the group theoretical background will be given which is used for
the construction of the nonlocal operators whose local parts  which are obtained
by taylor expansion  transform according to irreducible tensor representations
under the lorentz group, i.e., have denite spin and therefore also well dened
twist. these tensor representations are characterized by a specic symmetry class
with respect to the symmetric group and are determined by a few types of young
tableaux.

the lie algebra of the lorentz group l

+ is characterized by the generators of
the three spatial rotations ~m and the three boosts ~n ; from it the two (complex)
linear combinations ~m may be build which dene two independent so(3) groups:

(cid:2)m i

, m j

(cid:3) = iijkm k

,

(cid:2)m i

+, m j

(cid:3) = 0 with

~m = ~m  i ~n .

therefore, the (lie algebra of the) complex lorentz group is isomorphic to the
(lie algebra of the) direct product so(3, c)  so(3, c)  so(4, c). this char-
acterization makes use of the fact that the irreducible (nite) representations

d(j+,j)(~, ~) = d(j+)(~  i~)  d(j)(~ + i~)

(2.1)

of the restricted orthochronous lorentz group l
+  so(1, 3; r), where ~ and
~ are the angle of rotation and the rapidity of the boost transformations, are

5

determined by two numbers (j+, j), j = 0, 1/2, 1,    , which dene the spin
j = j+ + j of the representation.

let us now state some general results concerning nite dimensional representa-
tions of the (complex) orthogonal groups (see, e.g., chapters 8 and 10 of ref. [6]):
(1) the group so(n, c) has two series of complexanalytic3 irreducible repre-
sentations. every representation of the rst (resp. the second) series determines
and is in turn determined by a highest weight m = (m1, m2, . . . , m) whose com-
ponents mi are integers (resp. halfodd integers) and satisfy the conditions

m1  m2  . . .  m1  |m|

for n = 2,

m1  m2  . . .  m1  m  0 for n = 2 + 1.

(2.2)
(2.3)

the rst series determines the tensor representations, whereas the second series
determines the spinor representations.
(2) a tensor representation of so(n; c), for either n = 2 or n = 2 + 1,
being determined by the highest weight m = (m1, m2, . . . , m), mi integer, is

equivalent to another tensor representation ti1i2...in, n =p mi, which is realized

in the space of traceless tensors whose symmetry class is characterized by a young
pattern dened by the partition [m] = (m1, m2, . . . , m).
furthermore, if tgc is a complexanalytic representation of a (complex)
(3)
semi-simple lie group gc and tgr is the restriction of tgc to a real form gr of
gc, then, tgc is irreducible (fully reducible) i tgr is irreducible (fully reducible).
as a consequence, any irreducible representation of the complex group remains
irreducible if restricted to a real subgroup and, on the other hand, from any
irreducible representation of the real group by analytic continuation in the group
parameters an irreducible representation of its complexication is obtained.

therefore,

in order to investigate irreducible tensor representations of the
lorentz group we may consider equally well irreducible tensor representations
of the complex group so(4, c). even more, any irreducible representation of the
orthogonal group so(4) by analytic continuation induces an irreducible repre-
sentation of so(4, c), which by restriction to their real subgroup l
+ subduces
an irreducible representation of the lorentz group. since tensor representations
of the orthogonal group are uniquely determined by the symmetry class [m] of
their tensors we may study the irreducible tensor representations of the lorentz
group through a study of the corresponding young tableaux which determine the
irreducible representations of the symmetric group sn of permutations.

this characterization of tensor representations through their symmetry class
holds for any of the classical matrix groups, gl(n, c) and their various subgroups
(see also appendix a). however, for o(n, c) and so(n, c) these representations,
in general, are not irreducible. the reason is that taking the trace of a tensor
commutes with the orthogonal transformations. therefore, by schurs lemma,
irreducible subspaces of so(n, c) are spanned by traceless tensors having denite
symmetry class.

3 a representation is complexanalytic if it depends analytically on the group parameters.

6

from the requirement of tracelessness the following restrictions obtain (see,
e.g., [16]): the only young tableaux being relevant are those whose rst two
columns are restricted to have lenght 1 + 2  n (see (i)  (iv) below). two
representations r and r whose rst columns are related by 
1 = n  1, where
1  n/2, are called associated; if 1 = 
1 = n/2 this representation is called
selfassociated. after restriction to the subgroup so(n)  o(n) associated repre-
sentations are equivalent, whereas selfassociated representations decompose into
two nonequivalent irreducible representations.

let us illustrate this for the lorentz group by the representations which will be
of interest in the following. first of all, vector and axial vector representations v
and a = a, respectively, are associated ones, and antisymmetric tensor
representations, a = t t, are selfassociated which, if restricted to so(1, 3)
decompose into the (anti-)selfdual tensors a
2 ia). since later
on only representations of the orthochronous lorentz group containing the parity
operation are considered, this distinction is of no relevance. therefore, any tensor
of second order, t, may be decomposed according to

2(a  1

t = 1

{z

(2.4)

let us denote by t(j+, j), j+ + j integer, the space of tensors which carry
an irreducible representation d(j+,j) of the lorentz group. then from eq. (2.4)
we read o: s  t(1, 1) is a symmetric traceless tensor, a = a+
 
t(1, 0)  t(0, 1) are the selfdual and the antiselfdual antisymmetric tensors, and
1
4gt 
  t(0, 0) corresponds to the trivial representation dened through the
unit tensor. this decomposition corresponds to the clebsch-gordan decomposi-
tion of the direct product of two vector representations:

 + a

(cid:16) 1
2(cid:17) (cid:16) 1
2(cid:17) = (1, 1) (cid:16)(1, 0)  (0, 1)(cid:17)  (0, 0).
2, 1
2 , 1

(2.5)

now we consider the decomposition of the space of tensors of rank n into
irreducible representation spaces of so(1, 3; r). the dierent symmetry classes
are strongly restricted by the requirement that only such young patterns [m]
are allowed for which the sum of the rst two colums is lower or equal to four.
therefore, only the following young patterns correspond to nontrivial irreducible
representations by traceless tensors:

i.

ii.

iii.

iv.

j = n, n  2, n  4, . . .

j = n  1, n  2, n  3, . . .

j = n  2, n  3, . . .

j = n  2, n  3, . . .

7

in addition, for n = 4, also the completely antisymmetric tensor of rank 4 which
is proportional to , and therefore equivalent to the trivial representation is
allowed.

for the cases (i)  (iv) the minimal spin j  depending on n being either even
or odd  will be zero or one. in the case of symmetry type (iv) we have given only
one special young pattern; in principle the lenght of the second row may contain
up to m2 = [ n
2 ] boxes, and then the maximal spin is given by j = n  m2.
 the representations corresponding to symmetry class (i) are associated to
representations of the symmetry class (iii) with n + 2 boxes. the representations
corresponding to symmetry class (ii) and (iv) are selfassociated. the symmetry
2 1, n

class (ii) contains two non-equivalent parts being related to ( n
2 );
the symmetry class (iv) contains three nonequivalent parts related to ( n
2 , n
2  2),
( n
2 1, n
2 ); and so on. any tensor whose symmetry class does not
coincide with one of the above classes vanishes identically due to the requirement
of tracelessness.

2 1) and ( n

2 2, n

2 , n

there are two possible ways to construct the nonvanishing tensors. either
one symmetrizes the indices according to the corresponding (standard) young
tableaux and afterwards subtracts the traces, or one starts from tensors being
already traceless and nally symmetrizes because this does not destroy the trace-
lessness. for practical reasons the latter procedure seems to be preferable and will
be used in the construction of irreducible lightcone operators of denite twist.

3 twist decomposition of nonlocal lc operators

this chapter is devoted to show how the lc operators may be decomposed ac-
cording to their twist being dened by the rule twist( ) = dimension(d)  spin(j).
the procedure to be used is the following:

 rst, for arbitrary values of x we expand the nonlocal operators into a taylor

series of local tensor operators having denite rank and mass dimension,

 second, we decompose these tensor operators with respect to irreducible rep-
resentations of the lorentz group or, equivalently, the group so(4) having
denite spin and therefore also well-dened twist,

 third, we resum the innite series of irreducible tensor operators of equal
twist (for any n) to a nonlocal harmonic operator of denite twist which
contains, through its trace terms, also innitely many operators of higher
twist related to it, and

 nally, we project onto the lightcone, x  x, to obtain the required twist

decomposition of the original lightcone operators.

given by:

determines a specic structure (and, if necessary, also the avour content) of
the operators under consideration4; furthermore we have introduced the notation

d(1, 2)  (1


d +2


d),

with


d  d(a) =  + iga(x)

and


d =


   iga(x).

(3.3)

(3.4)

obviously, the expansion (3.2) of o(1, 2) into a taylor series makes use of the
translation of the eld operators, (x) = exp(ixp )(0) exp(ixp ), together
with [p, (0)] = i()(0).

the local operators appearing in eqs. (3.2) have a tensor structure which, in
general, is reducible with respect to the (orthochronous) lorentz group. however,
since only the tensor structure of these operators is of interest, we may restrict
the following considerations to the much simpler case (1 = 0, 2 = ) where
d(1, 2) reduces to the usual covariant derivative d multiplied by . any
(algebraic) operation which will be used henceforth is unchanged by the replace-
ment d  d(1, 2). this is independent from the fact that the product
d1(1, 2) . . . dn(1, 2), if expanded according to (3.3), decays into a sum of
tensors  although dierent  being equivalent realizations of the same symmetry
types. therefore, the twist decomposition which will be obtained for o(0, )
immediately holds with obvious replacements for o(1, 2).

there is an additional property of the considered operators. since the prod-
uct of the covariant derivatives is multiplied by the symmetric tensor x1 . . . xn
only its symmetric part d{1 . . . dn} is of relevance where the symbol {. . . } de-
notes symmetrization with respect to the enclosed indices (including division by
n!); in the same manner [. . . ] will be used to denote antisymmetrization. of
course, d{1 . . . dn} as any symmetric tensor decomposes into irreducible tensors
according to the clebschgordan series

the further representations correspond to the traces which contain an increasing

number of metric tensors (multiplied by x2). therefore, in the limit x  x only
the tensor space t( n
2 ) contributes. this leads to essential restrictions for the
decomposition of the lcoperators under consideration.

2 , n

the indices resulting from the taylor decomposition of the lcoperators will
be called internal ones, whereas the indices which are due to the nonlocal oper-
ator itself, i.e., which are related to  will be called external. for some physical
situations it will be useful to multiply also (some of the) external indices by x
and x, respectively, thereby extending the above conclusion.

3.1

(pseudo) scalar operators

the simplest cases to demonstrate how the method works are the (pseudo) scalar
operators. in order to think of some specic example we could take  = {1, (x) =
x, (x) = x , 5(x), 5} leading to operators having lowest twist min =
{3, 2, 2, 2, 3}, respectively. here, any lorentz index of the local operators is an
internal one and only the young tableaux of type (i)  corresponding to complete
symmetrisation  are of relevance. according to eq. (3.5) they contain contribu-
tions of twist n = min + 2n, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . which, on the lightcone, reduce to
min only.

to be denite, let us consider the operator

o(0, x) = (0)x/u(0, x)(x) ,

(3.6)

which also appears in the consideration of vector operators.
into local tensor operators reads

its decomposition

(0)x/(xd)n(0) ,

(3.7)

with the obvious abbreviation (xd)n  x1 . . . xnd1 . . . dn.

now, the local operators (0)d1 . . . dn(0) have to be made traceless.
this is easily achieved if we observe that a totally symmetric traceless tensor

t 1...n whose indices are completely saturated by contracting with x1 . . . xn is
a harmonic polynomial of degree n. it obeys the 4dimensional laplace equation
if continued to euclidean spacetime,


t n(x) = 0 with

(cid:3)


t n(x) := x1 . . . xn


t 1...n,

(3.8)

which is obvious if one observes that (cid:3)xx  2g. the solution of eq. (3.8) is
given by (see appendix b, eq. (b.5)):


t n(x) =

[ n

n (cid:0)x2|(cid:3)(cid:1) tn(x) .

(3.9)

10

from this we conclude, after replacing n  n + 1, that the local traceless quark
operators in eq. (3.7) read

(cid:2) (0)x/(xd)n(0)(cid:3)traceless

=

[ n+1

(n + 1  k)!

(n + 1)!k! (cid:18)x2

(cid:3)k (0)x/(xd)n(0).

let us remark that the summation over k could be left unbounded since, due to
the kth power of the laplacian, it automatically terminates at [ n+1

2 ].

now, these traceless operators of twist2 must be resummed by introducing

them into eq. (3.7). using the integral representation of eulers beta function,

this expression already has been dealt with by [4] without mentioning its deriva-
tion.
it is obvious that the terms corresponding to k = 1, 2, . . . contain oper-
ators of higher twist  = 4, 6, . . . which, because they are multiplied with x2,
do not contribute on the lightcone. therefore, the scalar lightcone operator
(0) xu(0, x)(x) is already of twist2.

let us observe that the derivation of (3.11) is independent of the origin of the
specic structure of the local tensors appearing in eq. (3.7). therefore, we may
replace d by d(1, 2) without changing the nal result:


o(1x, 2x) = (1x)x/u(1x, 2x)(2x)

the projection onto the lightcone leads to

otw2(1 x, 2x) = (1 x)(x)u(1 x, 2 x)(2 x);

(3.13)

of course, any of the scalar structures  introduced above could be used instead
of (x).

3.2

(pseudo) vector operators

let us now consider the (pseudo) vector operators with  being  (or 5):

o(0, x) = (0)u(0, x)(x) ,

(3.14)

whose local tensor operators dier from those in eq. (3.7) only by the absence of
x. they are given by

o1...n  (0)d{1 . . . dn}(0)

(3.15)
= (0){d1 . . . dn}(0) + n (0)[d{1] . . . dn}(0) + . . . ; (3.16)

they decompose into two parts being related to the young patterns (i) and (ii) as
well as to additional contributions being antisymmetric in (some of) the s, and
n = 2n/(n + 1) results from the nontrivial normalization of the young operator
y[m] with [m] = (n, 1) (see appendix a, eqs. (a.4) and (a.7)). let us remind that
because of the full reducibility of the direct product of a vector with a completely
symmetric tensor (3.15) corresponds to the following clebsch-gordan series

2, 1

(cid:0) 1

2(cid:1) (cid:16)(cid:0) n
=(cid:0) n+1

2 , n
2 , n+1

2(cid:1) (cid:0) n2

2 , n+1

(3.17)

2 (cid:1)(cid:17) (cid:0) n1

2 , n1

2 (cid:1)  . . . .

the mass dimension of the operator (3.14) is n + 3, and the spin of the vari-
ous contributions in (3.17) ranges from n + 1 up to 1 or 0 if n is even or odd,
respectively; therefore the twist decomposition reads:

o1...n = otw2

1...n + otw3

1...n + otw4

1...n + . . . ,

(3.18)

with the last term in the series being otw(n+2)
1...n, respectively. from
this it follows that the operator (3.2) for arbitrary x contains contributions of any
twist,   2. however, in the limit x  x only the rst three terms of eq. (3.18)
survive since the contributions for  > 4 are proportional to x2. therefore we
obtain the following decomposition:

1...n or otw(n+3)

o(0, x) = otw2



(0, x) + otw3

 (0, x) + otw4

 (0, x).

(3.19)

on the lightcone the totally symmetric part of eq. (3.16) contributes to  = 2, 4,
and the partially antisymmetric part of (3.16) contributes to  = 3, 4. obviously,
the twist4 operator consists of two independent parts.
(a) totally symmetric vector operators:
the totally symmetric traceless tensors which have twist  = 2 are contained in
t( n+1

2 ) and they are characterized by the following standard tableaux:

2 , n+1
 1 2

. . .

n

=

s

1...n

(0)d1 . . . dn(0)  trace terms

12

where the normalizing factor is 1. let us write this operator in the form

1...n = 1
otw2

n+1(cid:16) (0)d{1 . . . dn}(0)
nxl=1

+

(0){ld1 . . . dl1d||dl+1 . . . dn}(0)(cid:17)trace terms,

(3.20)

where the symbol | . . . | indicates that the enclosed indices are to be excluded
from the symmetrization caused by {. . . }. if the trace terms in (3.20) had been
determined, this tensor would be irreducible. let us postpone that determination
and make the resummation to the corresponding nonlocal operator in advance.
this is obtained by contracting with x1 . . . xn:

otw2

n (x) = x1 . . . xnotw2

1...n = 1

n+1(cid:16) (0)x/(xd)n(0)  trace terms(cid:17). (3.21)

the trace terms of (0)x/(xd)n(0) have been determined already in subsection

3.1. therefore, using (n + 1)1 =r 1

otw2

 (0, x) =

0 dn we obtain:

n (x) = z 1

o(0, x) being dened through eq. (3.11). of course, the derivative  could
with
be taken outside the parentheses in eq. (3.21) (and the integral) because the young
operators should be applied to traceless tensors. (for notational deniteness we
remark that partial derivatives are everywhere with respect to x only.) note

that xotw2
o(0, x) is obtained from eq. (3.22) by partial integration
observing that for any function f (x) the equality xf /x = f / holds.
analogous to the scalar case the generalization to arbitrary values (1, 2) is

 (0, x) =

 (1x, 2x) = z 1

o(1x, 2x),

o(1x, 2x) dened through eq. (3.12). by construction this traceless

with

(1x, 2x) = 0 ,

otw2

 (1x, 2x) = 0 .

(3.24)

let us now project onto the lightcone. since only one dierentiation 
appears in eq. (3.22) and (3.23) the whole sum in (3.11) and (3.12), respectively,
contributes on the lightcone only through the term k = 1. using the relation

2 x(cid:3)i (1x)x/u(1x, 2x)(2x)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=x. (3.26)

=z 1

obviously, the second term of the integrand which is proportional to x, and
which results from k = 1, is the trace term; up to an overall minus sign it is the
(symmetric) twist4 vector operator

otw4

,sym(1 x, 2 x) =  1

2 x (cid:3)z 1

0

d ln  (1x)x/u(1x, 2x)(2x)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=x. (3.27)

of course, if we multiply (3.26) with x the twist4 part vanishes and the remain-
ing contributions restore the scalar operator (3.13).

furthermore, after performing the dierentiations in (3.26) we can use the
axial gauge, xa = 0, in order to avoid the phase factor, u(1 x, 2 x) = 1; then
we obtain

 (1x, 2x) =z 1

otw2

2 y/d2i(cid:17)(y)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)y=x

,

(3.28)

with the convention that the covariant derivative d  d(1, 2) acts only on
the arguments of the dirac spinors (however, this convention which is used also
in the following, is necessary only to simplify the notation).

finally, it should be remarked, that the conditions (3.24), if translated into the
corresponding ones with respect to x, no longer hold for the lightcone operators
(3.26). this is obvious because by projecting onto the lightcone part of the
original structure of the operators has been lost. nevertheless, the resulting light
cone operators are restrictions of harmonic functions. this was the reason why
in order to determine the correct operators of denite twist we started with the
quark operators for arbitrary values of x.
(b) vector operators having symmetry class (ii)
now we consider the symmetry class (ii) which contributes to spin j = n and n1.
because of the specic symmetry of the local operators (3.15) there appears only
one nontrivial standard tableaux:5

. . .

n = 2n

n+1 a

1...n

(0)d1 . . . dn(0)  trace terms

with the normalization n = 2n/(n+1) of the young operator. the corresponding
traceless tensor being contained in t( n+1
2 ) has twist  = 3; it
is reducible with respect to so(1, 3), but irreducible with respect to o(1, 3):

2 )  t( n1

this irreducible tensor will be contracted with x1 . . . xn to obtain:

otw3

n (x) = 2
n+1

1

2(cid:16)g(x)  x(cid:17) (0)(xd)n(0)  trace terms .

(3.29)

obviously, the dierential operator 1
2 (g(x)  x) takes care of the antisym-
metrization ai after having symmetrized by contracting with the xs. however,
this contraction in addition causes that those contributions to (3.16) which are
antisymmetric in some of the s vanish such that the following relation holds

x1 . . . xno1...n = x1 . . . xn(cid:16)

s

o1...n + 2n

n+1 a

1...n

o1...n(cid:17).

s

1...n

(3.30)

of course, this relation could have been used to determine the prefactor n without
any knowledge of the normalization of the young operators.6

again, before determining the trace terms we resum these irreducible local

tensors to the corresponding nonlocal operators:

otw3

 (0, x) =(cid:16)

 (x)  x(cid:17)z 1

0

d(cid:16)o(0, x)  trace terms(cid:17).

(3.31)

in distinction to eq. (3.8) we now have to determine a traceless tensor with a

free index ,


t n(x)  x1 . . . xn


t 1...n, obeying the following two equations:


t n(x) = 0

(cid:3)

and


t n(x) = 0,



(3.32)

which correspond to taking the traces gij and gi, respectively. the solution
of these equations reads (see appendix b, eq. (b.9)):



t n =n

again, using (3.10) and the integral representation of 1/(n + 1) we obtain

taking into account all the n! equivalent representations related to the above young pattern or
simply replacing 1 d{ . . . dn} by 1
additional symmetry operation destroys the irreducibility and, furthermore, applied to tensors
being not traceless it may change the structure of the trace terms.

15

for the harmonic vector operator of twist  = 3 we obtain:

it fullls the equations

 (1x, 2x) = 0 .

(3.37)

because of the various dierential operators which come into the play by formulas
(3.35) or (3.36) it is not as easy as in the case of scalar operators to discriminate
between the dierent trace terms.

in the limit x  x only the terms with k = 0 and k = 1 of (3.34) survive. the

integrals which appear in these formulas may be rewritten as:

now, the various dierentiations should be carried out. again, using (x)f (x)
= f (x)/ and performing the partial integrations with respect to , after
generalization to arbitrary values of i, we nally obtain the simple expression:

in axial gauge we obtain (with the above mentioned conventions)

again, the trace terms of (3.42) being proportional to x determine the (par-

otw4

0

d(cid:8)(ln )x(cid:3) + (1 + 2 ln )(cid:9)o(1x, 2x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=x

. (3.44)

now, having determined the nonlocal operators of twist 2 and 3 we can use
either eq. (3.19) to get the nonlocal lightcone operator of twist  = 4 which
includes the contributions of the young patterns (i) and (ii) with spin n  1 being
contained in t( n1

2 ), or simply add both twist4 contributions:

2 , n1

otw4

 (1x, 2x) = otw4

,sym(1x, 2x) + otw4

,as(1 x, 2x)

this nishes the decomposition of the nonlocal vector quark operators into its
components of denite twist. quite analogous results obtain for the axial vector
operator by simply replacing  by 5.

3.3 antisymmetric tensor operators

now, together with its (partly) contracted operator m = xm, we consider
the following tensor operator 7

m(0, x) = (0)u(0, x)(x),
m(0, x) = (0)xu(0, x)(x).

(3.48)
(3.49)

the corresponding local tensor operators are given by

m1...n  (0)d{1 . . . dn}(0),

(3.50)
= n+1 (0){d1 . . . dn}(0)+n (0)[d{1] . . . dn}(0) (3.51)

+ . . . ,

7 the contracted form of the antisymmetric tensor operator appears in applications, e.g., to
the drellyan process (see [18, 19]). sometimes, especially in connection with expressions like
(x)(id), also the (local) tensor operator with i =  +ig has been used [21, 13] which,
however, is not irreducible. we denoted these tensors by m since they are related to the twist3
contribution of the quark mass in polarized deep inelastic scattering [29, 13].

17

which also decompose into two parts being related to the young patterns (ii)
and (iii) and further contributions being partially antisymmetric with respect to
the is; n+1 = 2(n + 1)/(n + 2) is already known, and n = 3n/(n + 2) is
the normalizing factor of y[m] with [m] = (n, 1, 1). these operators have mass
dimension n + 3; for n = 0 the operator transforms as an antisymmetric tensor
of rank 2 and therefore has spin j = 1, twist  = 2. for n > 0 these tensors are
reducible. the corresponding clebschgordan series is given by

(cid:0)(1, 0)  (0, 1)(cid:1) (cid:16)(cid:0) n
= (cid:16)(cid:0) n+2
2(cid:1) (cid:0) n

2 , n

2 , n
2 , n+2

2(cid:1) (cid:0) n2

2(cid:1) (cid:16)(cid:0) n2

2 , n

2(cid:1) (cid:0) n

(3.52)

2 , n2

2 (cid:1)(cid:17)  . . . .

again, as in the case of the vector operators, eq. (3.18), this corresponds  for
any xed value of n  to a nite twist decomposition (  2). in the limit x  x
only the rst three (respectively two) terms survive to get

m(0, x) = m tw2
m(0, x) = m tw2

 (0, x) + m tw3
 (0, x) + m tw3

 (0, x) + m tw4
 (0, x) .

 (0, x) ,

(3.53)

(3.54)

the local tensors of symmetry class (ii)  the only ones being relevant for m(0, x)
 contribute to  = 2, 3, whereas those of symmetry class (iii) contribute to
 = 3, 4. this may be seen as follows: in the case (ii) the trace terms being pro-

portional to x[pi g]i correspond to spin j = n and, therefore, to twist  = 3,

and those being proportional to x2gij correspond to spin j = n  1 and twist
 = 4, but they disappear on the lightcone. in the case of symmetry class (iii)
some of the latter contributions remain due to an additional derivation acting on
x2 (see eq. (3.78)). from this consideration it becomes obvious that the twist2
and twist4 contributions of m(0, 1x) are uniquely dened on the lightcone,
whereas the twist3 contributions consist of two parts.
(a) tensor operators of symmetry class (ii) and their contractions
now we consider tensor operators (and their contractions with x) having symme-
try class (ii) which is determined by the following standard tableaux:

 1 2


. . .

n =

2(n+1)
n+2 a



s

(0)d1 . . . dn(0)trace terms,

1...n

with normalizing factor n+1. the corresponding twist2 part transforms ac-
cording to t( n+2

18

(0){ld1 . . . dl1d||dl+1 . . . dn}(0)

(0){ld1 . . . dl1d||dl+1 . . . dn}(0)(cid:17)  trace terms .

of course, this representation is reducible with respect to so(1, 3), because in
that case it is possible to discriminate between the selfdual and antiselfdual part
related to 
. however, in physical applications this is of no relevance, since only
the orthochronous lorentz group o(1, 3) is relevant and then parity connects
them. after contraction with x1 . . . xn we obtain:

n(x) = 2
m tw2
n+1(x) = (0)x(xd)n(0)  trace terms,
m tw2

(0)]x(xd)n(0)  trace terms,

n+2[

(3.56)

(3.57)

respectively.8 proceeding in the same way as in the preceeding subsections we
sum up to obtain the nonlocal twist2 operators:

m tw2

 (0, x) = 2z 1
 (0, x) =(cid:16)

d  [(cid:16)m](0, x)  trace terms(cid:17),
(x)  x(cid:17)z 1

d(cid:16)m(0, x)  trace terms(cid:17),

0

0

m tw2

(3.58)

(3.59)

respectively. here, we remark that, due to the extra factor x in eq. (3.49), also
an extra factor  appears in the integrand of eqs. (3.58), (3.59) and, furthermore,
that eq. (3.59) has exactly the same structure as in the case of vector operators.

taking into account eq. (3.33) for the local traceless tensor


m n+1, the integral
representations of 1/(n + 2) and of the beta function we arrive at the following
expression for the nonlocal traceless (vector) operator


m (0, x) = m(0, x) +

dt(cid:18)x2

from this the irreducible twist2 operators are obtained as follows:

d [

m tw2

 (0, x) =


m (0, x).

to obtain the last equation use has been made of a partial integration; the result
is in conformity with the twist2 case of the vector operators (compare eq. (3.22)
and the related remarks). again, these operators are harmonic tensor functions:

(cid:3)m tw2

 (0, x) = 0,
(cid:3)m tw2

 (0, x) = 0,
 (0, x) = 0, m tw2

m tw2

 (0, x) = 0;

m tw2

 (0, x) = 0

(3.63)

(3.64)

8 here, the same comments are in order as in footnote 6. let us remind that according to

the denition of the antisymmetrization it holds 2t[] = t  t.

19

the rst set of equations, due to (3.61), is a consequence of the second ones.

for the projection onto the lightcone only the terms in eq. (3.60) with k = 1, 2

4 applications to distribution amplitudes and

generalization to conformal lc operators

in this section we like to point out one of the virtues of the twist decomposition
which have been given in section 3 by considering nonforward matrix elements
of the nonlocal lc operators with denite twist. furthermore, we introduce the
generalization of the twist decomposition to conformal lightcone operators.

4.1 matrix elements of lc operators with denite twist

the nonforward matrix elements of lightray operators with denite twist be-
tween the hadron states |pi, sii with momenta pi and spin si, i = 1, 2, appear as

23

nonperturbative inputs of various hard scattering processes. phenomenologically
these quantities will be represented by partition functions (in the forward case)
resp. distribution amplitudes. because of translation invariance,

hp2 |o(1x, 2x)| p1i = ei+xphp2 |o(x, x)| p1i,

(4.1)

it is completely sucient to consider matrix elements of the centered operators
o(x, x). their fourier transforms with respect to xp+ and xp dene the
above mentioned distribution amplitudes. in the following it is useful  as it was
the case for the twist decomposition  to study the nonlocal operators temporarily
for arbitrary values of x. then, the distribution amplitudes on the lightcone are
obtained as limiting case x  x.

first, we consider the scalar twist2 quark operators (3.11) between hadron
states |pi, sii and, in addition, we perform a kinematical decomposition of these
matrix elements. if the equation of motion for the external hadron states are taken
into account, then there remain only two independent distribution amplitudes
which may be choosen in the following way (u(p)  u(p, s) is the free hadronic
dirac spinor and, to simplify notations, xp

 is denoted by (xp)):

hp2|otw2(x, x)|p1i = g(2)(xp+, xp, 2x2, p1p2, 2) u(p2)(x)u(p1)

(4.2)
+ h(2)(xp+, xp, 2x2, p1p2, 2) m 1 u(p2)(xp)u(p1).

because of eq. (3.23) the twist2 vector operator is related to this kinematic
decomposition:9

hp2|otw2

d x

 hp2|otw2(x, x)|p1i

 (x, x)|p1i =z 1
= z 1

d x

0

hg(2)(xp+, xp, 22x2, p1p2, 2) u(p2)(x)u(p1)
+ h(2)(xp+, xp, 22x2, p1p2, 2) m 1 u(p2)(xp)u(p1)i.

(4.3)

the application of this relationship between scalar and vector operators to the
virtual compton scattering has been considered in detail in [7]. especially, it has
been shown that any of the physical results about the twist2 vector operator is
already contained in the twist2 scalar operator and its distribution amplitudes.
in order to indicate this roughly the fourier transformations of g and h  jointly
being denoted by f  with respect to xp as well as 2x2 are introduced,

f (xp+, xp, 2x2) =z +1

dz+dzei(cid:0)(xp+)z++(xp)z(cid:1)z dqeixqf (z+, z, q2),

evolution equations of amplitudes it is mandatory to use the operators with general values.

as has been proven in [7] if eq. (4.4) is used in the nonlocal lightcone expansion
of the product of the electromagnetic currents apprearing in the scattering ampli-
tude of the virtual compton scattering the latter will be expressed by the double
variable distributions g, h, and the evolution of these amplitudes is governed by
the anomalous dimensions of the twist2 nonlocal scalar operators.

in the case of twist3 vector operators the situation is more complicated.
however, the dening equation (3.36) may be rewritten somewhat and after partial
integration we obtain a relation which is similar to eq. (3.82):

otw3

 (x, x) = (cid:0)

 (x + 1)  x(cid:1)z 1

0


o(x, x)  otw2

furthermore, from eq. (3.82) we obtain the relation

xotw3



(x, x) = 0.

(4.5)

(4.6)

both equations restrict the nonforward matrix elements of the twist3 vector
operators. from the last equation we get

(4.8)

25

from this equation, being similar to (3.23), relations may be derived which are
analogous to eqs. (4.2) and (4.3). physical consequences of this circumstance have
not been drawn up to now. the situation in the case of twist3 tensor operators
is similar to the twist3 vector operators above  at least concerning that part
which obtains from symmetry type (ii).

4.2 conformal nonlocal lc operators with denite twist

as is well known the diagonalization of the anomalous dimensions which is essen-
tial for the solution of the evolution equations of the distribution amplitudes 
at least in one-loop order  is obtained by using conformal lightcone operators.
therefore, the results of this paper have to be generalized to conformal operators.
this, however, is easily achieved since the lightcone operators o(1x, 2x) con-
sidered in section 3 are related to the conformal ones by the following integral
representation [9, 10]:10



oconf

(, t; x) = (i)z d
o(1x, 2x) = z dt oconf

o(cid:0)(  (1  t))x, ( + (1 + t))x(cid:1);

( = + + t, t; x).

(4.9)

(4.10)

the coecient functions f conf
sion, which is analogous to equ. (1.3), are given by



(x2, , t) in the conformal operator product expan-

let us remark that

10 to be more precise, the operators oconf

(, t; x) obviously are scale invariant, and the local
conformal operators according to eqs. (4.12)  (4.14) are directly related to them; see also the
discussion of eq. (4.15) below. especially, they do not have denite conformal spin. however,
the latter may be obtained by a more involved resummation of the local conformal operators
which does not aect their twist decomposition. for a more detailed discussion of nonlocal
conformal operators see chapter 3 of ref. [4].



26

where

k = 212 2( 1

is the normalization factor which appears in the completeness and orthogonality
relation of the gegenbauer polynomials c

let us remark that in order to verify the relation (4.14) between the local and
the nonlocal conformal operators the restriction   k must be annuled and the
resulting function has to be analytically continued with respect to the argument
t which, from the orthogonality relation, is restricted to the intervall |t|  1.

the relations (4.9) and (4.10) between the (usual) nonlocal operators and the
conformal ones do not suer from this drewback. therefore, it is obvious that
the nonlocal conformal lightcone operators of denite twist are obtained from
the original scalar, vector and tensor operators of denite twist, which have been
determined in chapter 3, by simply inserting them into eq. (4.9). this may be
read o also from eq. (4.13) if one observes that

(ix+) c

r (ix+)r (xd)kr,
ek

(4.15)

where ek
r are the expansion coecients of the gegenbauer polynomials, is a sum of
terms containing the same number of dierential operators which are multiplied
by x1 . . . x. again, the fact will be used that the decomposition of a lorentz
tensor into irreducible ones does not depend on how the internal symmetry
of that tensor is build up. the twist decompositions of each individual term in
the above expansion (4.15) will be resummed to get the twist decomposition of
the local conformal operators. from this the twist decomposition of the nonlocal
conformal operators obtains.
the general result will be

oconf



(, t; x) = oconf, tw2



(, t; x) + oconf, tw3



(, t; x) + oconf, tw4



(, t; x)

(4.16)

with

oconf, 



(, t; x) = (i)z d

2

o

(  (1  t),  + (1 + t))

(4.17)

where o
(1, 2) has to be taken from the expressions determined in subsections
3.1  3.3, namely eqs. (3.12) in the scalar case, (3.25), (3.26), (3.41) and (3.46)
in the vector case, as well as (3.68), (3.69), (3.88) and (3.89) in the tensor case.
here, it should be remarked that for the generalization to the conformal operators
it was essential that the twist decomposition holds for arbitrary values of i and
not only for special ones like (1, 2) = (, +).

27

5 conclusions and outlook

in this paper we introduced an algorithm to decompose bilocal lightray operators
into operators of well-dened geometric twist and applied it to the bilocal quark
operators which appear, e.g., in virtual compton scattering in the generalized
bjorken region. to achieve this we made a taylor expansion with respect to both
arbitrary spacetime arguments of the nonlocal operators to get the related local
tensor operators. group theoretically the method is based on the (complete) re-
duction of the corresponding tensor representations of the orthrochronous lorentz
group into irreducible representations. then we resummed the local operators of
denite twist to nonlocal ones. after projection onto the lightcone the (nite)
twist decomposition of scalar, vector and antisymmetric tensor operators results.
thereby we were able to determine the trace terms of the nonlocal operators
explicitly. because of the fact that the internal lorentz indices of the local
operators have to be contracted by the (symmetric) product of the coordinates
x the nonlocal operators with denit twist are harmonic tensor functions. the
polynomial basis of these tensor functions has been determined in appendix b
for the scalar, vector and (second rank) antisymmetric tensor case. if necessary,
this could be extended also to symmetric tensors  which are of interest if gluon
operators have to be considered  and to tensors of higher rank.

there are many reasons why these operators had to be determined. first of
all, the more principal one, to make the twist decomposition rigorous and explicit.
this is required if the renormalization of the lightray operators should be con-
sidered on a safe basis. up to now the anomalous dimensions of the lightcone
operators have been determined without checking it explicitly also for the trace
terms. as long as only leading orders are of interest this may be acceptable. how-
ever, if higher perturbational orders come into the play one gets serious troubles
in determining the anomalous dimensions of, say, twist4 operators because trace
terms contribute essentially.

another point of principal interest, but also with practical consequences, ob-
tains if, as partly has been done in subsection 4.1, matrix elements of lightcone
operators with denite twist are considered. whereas up to now the amplitudes
related to the twist2 vector operator had to be projected onto the scalar case
by an additional contraction with x it is now possible to extract more detailed
information (see [7]). namely, having determined the explicit twist decomposition
it is possible, at least in principle, to relate the distribution amplitudes for vector
and tensor operators. furthermore, additional informations may be obtained also
for operators of higher twist and dierent relationships between them might be
derived. this, of course, has to be considered in more detail.

as we have seen, a simple reduction to the scalar case is impossible for the
twist3 operators. this will be of interest for the structure function g2 in polarized
deep inelastic scattering. the corresponding twist3 tensor operators transform-

factors and the trace terms. here, the shuryakvainshtein operators s(1, u, 2)
in the integrand introduce additional complications because they are trilinear
operators (being related to o and m by the equation of motion). as might
be expected they are related to the symmetry class (ii) but with the following
booking of indices

(0){1d2 . . . d1d[d]d+1 . . . dn}(0).

therefore, these operators can be considered in the same manner as has been done
for the vector (and tensor) operators of symmetry type (ii). a detailed treatment
of this more evolved situation remained open.

a further problem, which however appears to be much easier to solve, is to show
how the geometrical twist decomposition which has been given in this paper relates
to the dynamical twist decomposition of parton distributions given, e.g., by jae
and ji [18]; see also [19]. of course, it is to be expected that both decompositions
coincide in the leading terms, but dier at higher orders.

a symmetry classes and tensor representations

in this appendix for the readers convenience we collect some facts about tensor
representations of the classical matrix groups g and their relation to the symmet-
ric group sn which are of relevance in our consideration (see, e.g., [6, 8, 16, 27]).
given any irreducible matrix representation,

g  g 7 g  b(v ) :

gei = ej aj

i,

(a.1)

on some vector space v (of dimension dim v ) with base {ei, i = 1, 2, . . . , dim v }.
the direct products of these representations act on the tensor space t n v which
is build as tensor product of n copies of the vector space v :

t n v = (v  . . .  v ) .

the elements of the tensor space t n v are the ntimes contravariant tensors

t = ti1...inei1...in, where ti1...in are the components of t in the base ei1...in  (cid:0)ei1 
. . .  ein(cid:1),

ik  [1, . . . , dim v ]. 12 the components of the tensors of rank n

transform under g according to

(t)i1...in  ti

1...i

n = ai

1

i1 . . . ai

n

inti1...in.

(a.2)

in the following we shall comment on the connection between the irreducible
representations of the general linear group gl(n, c) (together with its subgroups)
and of the symmetric group sn on these tensor spaces. let us, at the moment con-
sider only the groups g = gl(n, c), sl(n, c), su(n). given any (irreducible)
representation of g on v , then its nfold tensor product denes a reducible rep-
resentation a(n) which, together with the reducible representation  of sn, is
determined by:

a(n)(g)t  a(n)(g)(ti1...inei1...in)
(ti1...inei1...in)

t 

:= ti1...in(ge)i1  . . .  (ge)in,
:= t(i1...in)ei1  . . .  ein,

g  g,

  sn;

therefore the action of both groups on the tensors t commutes 13

(cid:2) a(n)(g), (cid:3)t = 0.

(a.3)

of course, the same conclusion holds for the elements p (), ()  r, of

the group algebra r[sn] of the symmetric group. this algebra, considered as a
vector space, carries the regular representation of sn which is known to be fully
reducible.

12 here, neither covariant tensors which act on direct products of the dual space v  nor mixed
ones are considered since, for the case under consideration, the indices may be raised or lowered
by the metric tensor.

13 this results from the fact that the product of the matrix elements aj
i

in eq. (a.2) is

bisymmetric under sn.

30

the irreducible representations [m] of the symmetric group are uniquely de-

termined by the idempotent (normalized) young operators

y[m] =

f[m]
n!

pq with p =xph[m]

p, q = xqv[m]

q q,

(a.4)

y[m]y[m] = [m][m]y[m],

(a.5)

which are related to corresponding young tableaux being denoted by [m]. if

m = (m1, m2, . . . mr) with m1  m2  . . .  mr,

rxi=1

mi = n,

(a.6)

denes a young pattern (fig. 1) then a young tableaux [m] is obtained by putting
in (without repetition) the indices i1, . . . in  corresponding to dierent places
within the direct product  and h[m] and v[m] denotes their horizontal and vertical
permutations with respect to [m]. a standard tableaux is obtained when the indices
i1, . . . , in are ordered lexicographically. there are

f[m] = n!qi<j(li  lj)

i=1 li!

qr

with li = mi + r  i, x[m]

f 2
[m] = n!,

(a.7)

dierent standard tableaux which correspond to f[m] dierent, but equivalent, irre-
ducible representations of sn whose dimension is given also by f[m]. the (normal-
ized) young operators y[m] according to (a.5) project onto mutually orthogonal
irreducible left ideals of r[sn].

m1 boxes
m2 boxes
...

mr boxes

figure 1: young pattern m

in this way the tensor product of n spaces v carries the regular representation

of the group sn and decomposes into p[m] f[m] irreducible subspaces containing

tensors of symmetry class [m]. however, the tensors actually are specied by tak-
ing for the indices i1, . . . , in arbitrary values from the range [1, . . . , dim v ]. there-
fore, with respect to the group g the standard tableaux is dened by putting into
the young pattern the values of the indices ik such that they are nondecreasing
from left to right and increasing from top to bottom! because of eq. (a.3) by
schurs lemma it follows that the representation a(n)(g) of g is reducible and
it decomposes into as many irreducible representations as there are (in general

31

reducible) representations of sn, i.e., any tensor representation of the group g is
characterized by a standard tableaux,

a(n)(g) = 
[m]

r[m](g)  el[m],

 = 
[m]

er[m]  [m](),

where el[m] is the unit matrix; more explicitly we have

a(n)(g)[m],[m] = [m][m]r[m]

(g),

(a.8)

(a.9)

where  = 1, . . . , r[m] counts dierent equivalent irreducible representations of
sn and  = 1, . . . , l[m]  f[m] counts the basis elements of these representations.
the representations r[m](g) of g in t n v are characterized by equivalent young

operators by[m] = qp: 14

t n v = 
[m]



 by[m](t n v ).

(a.10)

the invariant subspaces projected out by by[m](t n v ) are irreducible with re-

spect to gl(n, c), sl(n, c) and su(n). after restriction onto these subgroups
some of the irreducible representations become equivalent ones. however, for
o(n, c), so(n, c) and sp(2) these representations, in general, are not irre-
ducible and decompose further.

concerning the orthogonal groups from the subspaces of the above introduced
symmetry classes only the completely antisymmetric ones (for n  n) remain
irreducible. the reason is that, because of the very denition of the orthogonal
groups, ijai
l = kl, a  o(n), the operation of taking the trace of a tensor
commutes with the orthogonal transformations of that tensor:

kaj

tr t = ijt ij = ijai

kaj

lt kl = tr t.

(a.11)

again, by schurs lemma, irreducible subspaces of o(n) are spanned by traceless
tensors having denite symmetry class. this decomposition is obtained as follows:

t i1i2...in
[m]

=


t i1i2...in
[m]

+ x1r,sn

iris t i1...ir1ir+1...is1is+1...in

[m2]

.

(a.12)

the tensors which appear under the sum have degree n  2 and a young pattern
[m  2]  [m] obtained by removing two boxes from the (right) border without
destroying the property (2.2) and (2.3) to be a pattern. they may be decomposed
again into traceless ones plus some remainder, and so on. therefore, a traceless
tensor is obtained from the original one by succesively subtracting the traces.

14 note, that the symmetrizations p and the antisymmetrizations q with respect to [m] are
interchanged. this corresponds, in the terminology of quantum mechanics, to quantum number
permutations instead of the place permutations above. and, contrary to y[m] which denes

a left ideal in r, by[m] denes a right ideal.

b harmonic tensor functions

in this appendix we derive the projection operators which determine the traceless
part of a completely symmetric tensor of rank n, t{1...n}, of a tensor of rank n+1
being symmetric in n of its indices, t{1...n}, and of a tensor of rank n + 2 being
symmetric in n and antisymmetric in the remaining two indices, t[]{1...n}. to
achive this we use the fact that, after contracting the indices of the symmetric
part with some vector x, the resulting scalar, vector and antisymmetric tensor
functions obey the following equations:

(cid:3)


t n(x) = 0,

t n(x) = 0,

(cid:3)


t []n(x) = 0,

(cid:3)


t n(x) = 0,



t []n(x) = 0,




t []n(x) = 0.



(b.1)

(b.2)

(b.3)

the rst of these equations dene the harmonic polynomials of order n. its

(i)
solution, in d dimensions, is given by (see e.g. [30], chapter ix)


t n(x) = h (d)

n (cid:0)x2|(cid:3)(cid:1)tn(x)
(cid:18) ky=1
2 ]xk=1

[ n

= (cid:26)1 +

d + 2n  2  2(cid:19)(x2)k (cid:3)k

2k k! (cid:27)tn(x),

1

which, for d = 4, may be rewritten as


t n(x) = h (4)

n (cid:0)x2|(cid:3)(cid:1) tn(x)

with the harmonic projection operator

h (4)

n (cid:0)x2|(cid:3)(cid:1) =

[ n

2 ]xk=0

(n  k)!

k!n! (cid:18)x2
4 (cid:19)k

(cid:3)k.

(b.4)

(b.5)

(b.6)

let us now consider the set of equations (b.2) to determine the harmonic
(ii)
vector functions tn(x) being related to the traceless tensors t{1...n} which, to
the best of our knowledge, are not determined up to now. of course, after the
nfold contraction with x they are harmonic polynomials of order n,

t

n(x) := h (4)



n (cid:0)x2|(cid:3)(cid:1) tn(x),

(b.7)

and the traces corresponding to gi are obtained through dierentiation with re-
spect to x. therefore, the most general ansatz for the harmonic vector functions
which conserves its order is



t n(x) =(cid:8)

  anx(x)  bnx2(cid:9) h (4)

n (cid:0)x2|(cid:3)(cid:1) tn(x).

(b.8)

33

from the two conditions (b.2) we obtain two equations from which the coecients
an, bn can be determined:

1 = n(d + n  1)an + 2(n  1)bn,
0 = nan + (d + 2n  4)bn.

note, that to derive these conditions we used the fact that (cid:3)h (4)

(cid:2)(x), h (4)

n (cid:3) = 0 and (x)tn(x) = ntn(x). the solution of these equations is

n (x2|(cid:3))  0,

n an =

d + 2n  4

,

bn = 

1

;

(d + 2n  2)(d + n  3)

(d + 2n  2)(d + n  3)

for d = 4 it reduces to

an = 1/(n + 1)2,

bn = an/2.

therefore, we obtain the following result:



t n(x) =(cid:26)

 

1

(n + 1)2 hx(x)  1

2 x2i(cid:27) h (4)

n (cid:0)x2|(cid:3)(cid:1) tn(x) .

(b.9)

if eq. (b.9) will be contracted with x then, after some tedious but straightforward

calculations, we obtain, as is should be, the harmonic polynomial


t n+1(x).

(iii)

using the same procedure we may construct the harmonic antisymmet-

ric tensor functions
structure (remind the convention t[] = 1

2 (t  t)):


t []n(x). the most general ansatz for it has the following



t []n =(cid:8)



  anx[

]  bnx2[

]  cnxx[](cid:9) t[]



n(x).

(b.10)

the conditions (b.3) lead to the requirement that the coecients of the terms

 , x and [
] should vanish. the corresponding system of linear
equations reads

1 = (d + n  2)an/2 + (n  1)bn
0 = 2bn + (d + n  2)cn
0 = an + cn + (d + 2n  4)bn .

it is solved by the following values:

(an + cn, bn, cn) =

(d + 2n  2)(d + n  4)(cid:18)d + 2n  4, 1,

2

(d + n  2)(cid:19) ,

2

and for d = 4 we obtain

(an + cn, bn, cn) =

2

n(n + 1)(n + 2)(cid:16)n(n + 2),  1

2 (n + 2), 1(cid:17) .

34

from this, using the replacement xx[] = x[]x  x[
obtain:

] we nally



t []n(x) =n

hx[[

]]i (x + 2)(cid:17)oh (4)

n (cid:0)x2|(cid:3)(cid:1) t[]n(x) .

(b.11)

let us remark that the various dierential operators which appear in eqs. (b.9)
and (b.11) may be expressed by the generators of the conformal group, namely
p, m, d and k.
