abstract

asymptotically anti-de sitter spacetimes with poincare invariance along the boundary
can describe, via the ads/cft correspondence, either relevant deformations of a con-
formal eld theory or non-conformal vacuum states. i consider examples of both types
constructed in the framework of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity. i explain the
proof and motivation of a gravitational c-theorem which is independent of dimen-
sion. i show how one class of examples can be elevated to ten-dimensional geometries
involving distributions of parallel d3-branes. for these cases some peculiar properties
of two-point functions emerge, and i close with speculations on their physical origin.

1 introduction

the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] (for a review see [4]) oers us the opportunity
to study not only exactly conformal eld theories and their anti-de sitter duals, but
also deformations of conformal eld theories corresponding to distortions of the anti-
de sitter geometry. a subtlety that was realized early on is that these distortions can
represent either changes in the hamiltonian of the dual eld theory or changes in the
physical state. which obtains in any particular case is determined by the asymptotics
of the various elds involved near the boundary of anti-de sitter space. resolving this
ambiguity has been one of the main obstacles to formulating the renormalization group
(rg) equations clearly in an ads/cft setting. very roughly, supergravity equations
of motion are second order, admitting two solutionsone solution being a deformation
of the hamiltonian and the other a change in the physical statebut rg equations are
rst order, and any translation of rg into ads/cft language must somehow specify
which supergravity solution the rg picks out. conventionally we think of rg as acting
on the hamiltonian rather than the state, so we should be looking for a way to track
deformations of the hamiltonian with the state held xed.

an improved understanding of rg is one motivation of the work i will describe. the
result which touches most directly on rg is a gravitational c-theorem, which i will
exhibit in section 2 after some preliminaries to set conventions and make slightly more
precise the distinction between states and deformations. i will then move on in section 3
to an interesting class of examples which represent states in the coulomb branch of
n = 4 super-yang-mills theory. the supergravity geometries can be described wholly
in terms of ve-dimensional n = 8 gauged supergravity, but the physics is clearest
from the distribution of d3-branes in ten dimensions from which these geometries de-
scend. they provide a simple example of consistent truncation. they also exhibit two
surprising features: 1) the distribution of d3-branes is not always positive denite, and
2) the spectrum of supergravity excitations is often gapped or even discrete. the spec-
trum can be obtained through an analysis of two-point functions, and this will be the
topic of section 4. this talk is mostly based on collaborative work with d. freedman,
k. pilch, and n. warner [5, 6].

2 a c-theorem from gravity

in order to have a clear methodology for computing physical quantities such as cor-
relators, i will restrict attention to spaces which are asymptotically anti-de sitter.
furthermore, all my examples will have 3+1-dimensional poincare invariance, so that

the ve-dimensional geometry can be written in the form

l2 g.

with this choice of coordinates, a = r/l corresponds to pure ads5 (or more precisely
a poincare patch of ads5), with r = 4
if a is not linear, then there must
be some matter elds providing an r-dependent stress-energy tensor which supports
the geometry. in order to have poincare invariance, essentially the only possibility is
that the matter elds should be scalars. for the space to be asymptotically ads5, we
need the scalars to approach constant values near the boundary. those constant values
must represent an extremum of the scalar potential, and by convention we will say the
scalars vanish there. near the boundary one can use a linearized approximation to
the scalar equations of motion: for one scalar, ( +m2) = 0. the two independent
solutions map to deformations and vacuum states in the following way:

  er/l  l  l + er/lo
  e+r/l  hoi = e+r/l

(2)

where  = 2 q4 + (ml)2 and o is the color singlet operator (of dimension +) in
the conformal eld theory which is dual to . in words, the more singular asymptotics
of  corresponds to adding a source for o to the lagrangian, while the less singular
solution corresponds to giving o a vev. these are dual concepts in the sense of
legendre transforms. it is possible in certain circumstances for the roles of + and
 to be interchanged [7]. this talk will focus on deformations and states of n = 4
super-yang-mills, where the conventional identication of the more singular solution
as a deformation and the less singular one as a vev is correct for all the elds.

there is a general intuition in quantum eld theory that there is a thinning out of
degrees of freedom as one passes from the ultraviolet to the infrared. this holds equally
whether the energy scales of the theory arise from the physical state (as in spontaneous
symmetry breaking) or from the dynamics of the lagrangian (as in connement). a
rst step, then, in nding the meaning of the renormalization group in the language of
ads/cft is to see how and whether one can quantify the thinning out process.

in two dimensions there is a celebrated theorem of zamolodchikov [8] to the eect
that renormalization group ows follow steepest descent trajectories of a so-called c-
function of the couplings in the hamiltonian. at xed points of the renormalization
group the c-function coincides with the central charge in the virasoro algebra, or
equivalently with the coecient c in the anomalous one-point function

where g is an external metric and r is its scalar curvature. the analogous expression
in four dimensions, in the notation of [9], is

 ig =

(4)

the rst term is the square of the weyl tensor and the second is the topological euler
density. it has been conjectured by cardy [10] that any renormalization group ow
which begins and ends at a conformal xed point must have a lower value of a in the
infrared than the ultraviolet.

on the other hand, it has been shown [11] using the prescription of [2, 3] that a pure
ads5 geometry (that is, (1) with a(r) = r/l) leads to a one-point function of the form
(4) with

a = c =

2
5a(r)3 .

(5)

in arbitrary even boundary dimension d a similar expression emerges from the analysis
[11] with all anomaly coecients in a xed ratio and proportional to 1/a(r)d1, which
again is constant since a(r) is linear.

the remarks of the last two paragraphs suggest a natural c-theorem in ads/cft:
can it be shown that in a geometry where a(r) approaches linear behavior both as
r  + (near the boundary of adsd+1) and as r   (in the deep interior), the
limiting value of 1/a(r)d1 is smaller in the deep interior than near the boundary?
the answer is yes for a very straightforward reason: inspecting the curvature tensors
for the metric (1), one nds that

(d  1)a = rt

t  rr

r = gt

t  gr

r = 2

d(t t

t  t r

r )  0

(6)

where in the second to last step we have used einsteins equations, and in the last
step we have assumed the null energy condition: t  0 for any null vector
. this energy condition is obeyed for all the matter elds in gauged supergravity,
and to my knowledge also in string theory (i exclude from consideration orientifold
planes, which are non-dynamical in the sense that their location is xed). it should be
noted that all curvature tensors as well as the stress tensors in (6) are d+1-dimensional
quantities relating to the supergravity dual picture, whereas in (4) we were discussing
d-dimensional quantities relating to the boundary quantum eld theory. an equivalent
form of (5) was considered independently in [12], and its monotonicity was checked for
the non-supersymmetric ows studied there.

a compelling point of evidence in favor of the denition (5) is that it leads to the
correct central charges for supersymmetric rg ows between conformal xed points.
the eld theory techniques for analyzing these ows were developed in [13]. ads/cft
examples have been studied in [14, 15, 16, 17, 5]. i will focus on the case worked out in

3

complete detail in [5], namely n = 4 super-yang-mills theory deformed to an n = 1
theory by adding a mass for one of the adjoint chiral superelds. this has already been
discussed in the talk by n. warner, so i will be brief.

the superpotential for the eld theory in question is

w = tr 3[1, 2] +

m
2

tr 2

3 .

(7)

using the techniques of [13], the infrared limit can be shown to be a strongly interacting
xed point with a quartic superpotential proportional to tr [1, 2]2. the anomaly
coecients c and a can be computed from anomalies in the divergence of the r-current:
this is on account of the fact that in n = 1 supersymmetry, r and t 
 are in the
same multiplet. the result is that c = a both in the infrared and the ultraviolet, and
cu v = n 2/4 while cir = 27
t hooft anomaly matching is required to obtain
the latter result. these predictions are precisely matched by (5) applied to the dual
supergravity geometry [5], which was described in detail by n. warner earlier in this
conference. the rst check that ads/cft predicted the correct value for cir/cu v was
carried out in [15]. subsequent work on the subject includes [17, 5].

32 cu v .

in the case of supersymmetric ows, it was possible to express the c-function as an
explicit function of the supergravity scalars [5]: all r-dependence in c(r) arose strictly
through the scalar proles. the scalars evolution followed the gradient ow of an
appropriate power of the c-function. this has very much the avor of zamolodchikovs
c-theorem, but it seemed to rely on supersymmetry. however it was recently shown
[18] that any solution to the equations of motion of

s = z d4xdr q|detg|(cid:20)

the point is that, given v () (10) can in principle be solved for w (). thus the relation
c  1/w ()3, rst derived in [6] for supersymmetric ows, is seen to extend to the
r. myers has also noted that this solution generating technique [19] can be applied even in the

absence of supersymmetry.

figure 1: possible behaviors for a(r).
in case (1), constant negative curvature is
recovered asymptotically as r  . in case (2), a(r) is unbounded below but a is
dened for all r. in case (3), a(r)   at nite r.

non-supersymmetric context [18]only now w () is not unique but rather depends
on as many constants of integration as there are scalars. this gives me some new hope
that the rg equations might yet be related explicitly to supergravity equations, with
the aforementioned constants of integration specifying what physical quantities are
held xed in the renormalization. however i should note the drawback that w () is
not a single-valued function of the i. the graph of w versus i is a piecewise smooth,
codimension one hypersurface in the region of (w, i) space where v () + 1
3w 2 > 0. it
has discontinuous slope at the boundary of this region: it reects o the boundary
to form multiple sheets for the function w ().

3 states on the coulomb branch of n = 4 super-

yang-mills

the main geometrical fact we have learned from the previous section is that the function
a(r) appearing in the metric (1) is concave down as a function of r: that is, a(r)  0.
the inequality is saturated precisely for (locally) anti-de sitter space. there are then
three dierent possibilities for the behavior of a(r) in geometries dual to eld theories
with conformal invariance broken either by vevs or relevant deformations. they are
sketched in gure 1.

all three possibilities are realized in various contexts in the literature. case (1)
occurs for the renormalization group ow discussed in the previous section. case (3)
is perhaps the most generic, and occurs in various attempts to nd a geometry dual to

5

conning gauge theories [20, 21, 22]. it has the pathology of a naked timelike singularity
at the radius where a(r)  . the borderline case (2) has unbounded curvatures as
r  , but there are no genuine curvature singularities inside the poincare patch.
an example of (2) was obtained in [6] as a state on the coulomb branch of n = 4
super-yang-mills, and we will discuss it below. earlier work on the subject includes
[23, 7], and the independent work of [24] has some overlap with the results of [6].

the coulomb branch of su(n) n = 4 super-yang-mills theory is parametrized
by vevs of the scalar elds xi, or equivalently the relative positions of the n d3-
branes in the transverse six dimensions. we should be able to describe these states
in terms of an asymptotically ads5 geometry with some scalar proles specied near
the boundary. instead of specifying directly the eigenvalues of the xi, this approach
amounts to specifying the quantities tr x(i1xi2 . . . xi). actually these gauge-invariant
traces do not wholly x the eigenvalues of the xi, as we will see in examples.

the simplest case from the point of view of ve-dimensional supergravity is to give
vevs only to those scalars which are in the same d = 5, n = 8 supersymmetry
multiplet as the graviton. there are 42 such scalars, of which 20 with (ml)2 = 4
are dual to the operators tr x(ixj). they parametrize the coset sl(6, r)/so(6).
a explicit discussion of the ve-dimensional geometries in question was given in the
talk by n. warner: they all preserve 16 supersymmetries and a so(n)  so(6  n)
subgroup of so(6) (by convention so(1) is the trivial group). here i will focus on
the ten-dimensional origin of these geometries and on the spectrum of supergravity
excitations which they give rise to.

one obvious point is that the ten-dimensional geometries must be near-horizon limits

of multi-center d3-brane solutions: that is,

gral is one.
(in the supergravity approximation, discreteness of d3-branes is lost).
the so(n)  so(6  n) symmetry of the ve-dimensional supergravity solution must
translate into a symmetry of the distribution (~y). it emerged from the analysis of [6]
that the distributions in question were

n = 0 :

n = 1 :

where (x) = d
dx (x). an obvious peculiarity of the n = 5 and n = 6 distributions
is that (~y) is not a positive denite distribution. this means that there are ghost
d3-branes with the opposite charge and tension of a normal d3-brane. formally the
force between ghost d3-branes and normal d3-branes vanishes, but the kinetic terms
for uctuations of a ghost d3-brane are negative. this is apparently invisible in ve-
dimensional supergravity; nevertheless i regard non-positive  as unphysical. a second
point to observe is that the geometry away from the n = 6 brane distribution, (13), is
invariant if we change all the 2
i by the same additive constant. in particular, when all
the is are equal, the geometry outside the -function shell in the n = 6 distribution
is perfect ads5  s5. this continues to hold when we replace the -function with an
ordinary -function (thus curing the pathology of ghost d3-branes). this geometry
was considered in [26, 27]. the only gauge singlets that have vevs are also so(6)
singlets, the simplest being trpi x 2
i . these operators are not in short multiplets, and
are expected to acquire large anomalous dimensions in the strong coupling limit. how
this squares with the exactness of the classical moduli space of n = 4 super-yang-mills
is a source of some puzzlement for me.

extracting the distributions (12) from the explicit ve-dimensional geometries that
n. warner discussed is a slightly involved calculation. i will summarize only the most
interesting part: the consistent truncation ansatz.

consistent truncation is often mistaken for the imprecise statement that all but
nitely many kaluza-klein modes can be consistently set to zero in reduction of super-
gravity theories on compact manifolds. in the case of s5 it is dicult to see how this
can be so, since both the modes that are kept and the modes that are cast out include

7

so(6) singlets and non-singlets. a more straightforward way to think about consis-
tent truncation is as a technique for generating exact solutions to a higher dimensional
supergravity from the data of a lower-dimensional one.

unlike for eleven dimensional supergravity on s7 [28, 29] or s4 [30], the full solution-
generating ansatz for ten-dimensional type iib supergravity on s5 is not known even
in implicit form. we do however have the full ansatz when only scalars are excited;
essentially it was stated in [16]. briey, the 42 scalars in the n = 8 d = 5 supergraviton
ab for the coset e6(6)/usp(8). the
multiplet can be parametrized by a 27-bein vab
ab they are antisymmetrized
indices a and b are in the fundamental 8 of usp(8). in vab
and the symplectic trace is removed: this results in the 27-dimensional representation
of usp(8), which is also the fundamental representation of e6(6). a common convention
is to use zab to denote a vector in the 27 of e6(6) and zab for the 27.

a crucial decomposition in the construction of d = 5 n = 8 gauged supergravity

[31] is

e6(6)  sl(6, r)  sl(2, r)

27 = (6, 2) + (15, 1)

zab = (zi, z[ij]) ,

(14)

where we have indicated in the second and third lines the way the 27 of e6(6) splits
under this decomposition. lowered indices i, j refer to the 6 of sl(6, r). they key
fact in (14) which makes it possible to gauge the obvious so(6) subgroup of sl(6, r)
is that the 27 of e6(6) contains the adjoint of so(6) (it is the 15). that is important
because the vector elds of ungauged d = 5 n = 8 supergravity transform in the 27.
these vectors correspond (roughly) to components of the metric with one leg in the
non-compact dimensions and one along a killing vector, k m ij , of s5. (here i use m to
denote a tangent space index to s5; ij label the relevant element of the 15). up to a
normalization, the k m ij can be taken to be the projections onto s5 of the dierential
operators xi j  xj i .

now suppose we have some arbitrary solution to d = 5 n = 8 gauged supergravity
ab. to construct the ten-dimensional
ab = k m ij (v 1)ij ab. solve the

where m are coordinates on s5. general elements of e6(6)/usp(8) can lead to metrics

parametrized by the 20 scalars dual to tr x(ixj), 2/3gmn is the metric of an ellipsoid.
once the metric (16) has been obtained, it is relatively straightforward to nd ap-

propriate coordinates yi in which the metric takes the form (11).

4 two-point functions and the spectrum of super-

gravity excitations

given a two-point function ho(x)o(0)i, there is a straightforward way of extracting
the spectrum of excitations in the eld theory that can be excited using the operator
o. let us dene

(s) = z d4x eipxho(x)o(0)i ,

(17)

where s = p2. the function (s) will be analytic in the complex s-plane except possibly
for branch cuts and/or poles on the real axis. the discontinuity across the real axis,
disc (s) = (s + i) (s i), is the spectral measure of the invariant masses of the
states which o(0) can create from the vacuum. if we use the ads/cft prescription
for computing greens functions [2, 3], which reads, schematically,

wcf t [0] = log(cid:28)expz d4x 0o(cid:29)cf t

= extremum
0

 ads

ssu gra[] ,

(18)

what one nds is that this spectral measure is precisely the spectrum of the linearized
equation for excitations of  in the bulk spacetime.

to be more explicit, consider the example of the ve-dimensional dilaton, which is
dual to the dimension four operator o4 = tr(f 2 + /  x x + . . .). (i have not
been fastidious about numerical factors here). the ve-dimensional wave equation is
 = 0. this can be solved using separation of variables: dening a radial variable z

such that the ve-dimensional metric takes the conformally at form

actually all the supergravity calculations can be done equally eciently starting from the ten-
dimensional backgrounds. the ve-dimensional dilaton is the s-wave of the ten-dimensional dilaton.

figure 2: the various behaviors for v (z) far from the boundary of ads5: a) vanishes;

the spectrum the schroedinger operator [2
z + v (z)] is precisely the spectrum of
excitations created by o4. the expression for v in the last line of (20) has the form of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, so we know that the spectrum is bounded below,
p2  0. the qualitative behavior of the spectrum can be reasoned out directly from
the shape of v (z). the possibilities are shown in gure 2. the rst is encountered
for the n = 1 ow, and the spectrum for p2 is (0,). the second is encountered for
n = 2, and the spectrum is (2/l4,). the third is encountered for n = 3, and the
fourth for n = 4, 5; in these cases the spectrum is discrete. it is in fact calculable for
n = 4, with the result p2 = 42

l4 j(j + 1) for j = 1, 2, 3, . . ..

a more precise and exhaustive description of the spectrum and the explicitly calcu-
lable two-point functions can be found in [6, 24, 25]. the ve- and ten-dimensional
geometries were also studied in [32], and the linearized uctuation equations were re-
lated to integrable models of the calogero-moser type.

the outstanding puzzle that emerges from the analysis of the spectrum is, how is
coulomb branch physics giving rise to mass gaps and discrete spectra? after all, the
coulomb branch is distinguished in that there are long range forces, which suggests
massless excitations.
i do not have a good answer, but i will make some remarks
which tend to make the obvious answers less plausible and conclude with a (perhaps

my lecture at strings 99 and the initial versions of [6] were slightly mistaken on this point. the

error was caught in [25].

10

wild-eyed) suggestion of what might be going on.

the rst obvious point is that there are only o(n) truly massless modes, correspond-
ing to the un-higgsed u(1)n 1 gauge group. we do not expect classical supergravity to
see subleading eects in n. thus perhaps the massive excitations we are seeing are color
singlet combinations of the o(n 2) massive modes, corresponding to strings stretched
between dierent d3-branes in the distribution. in some sense i think this idea has
to be right. but there are some diculties left. first, the typical mass of a stretched
string is /, where  is the diameter of the brane distribution. but in supergravity
the scale of the mass gap (or the discrete spectra) is instead /l2 = /(qg2
y m n ).
the stretched strings are bps states, so their masses are protected; but color-singlet
bound states of them need not be bps, and their masses could be smaller than the
sum of the masses of the constituents because of binding energy. in fact, maybe the
binding energy lowers the mass by the requisite factor qg2
y m n . in a lot of ways this
sounds like the most plausible way out of our diculties. however i am not wholly
satised with it for the following reasons. first, the bps mass spectrum of stretched
strings extends continuously to 0 in the large n approximation. a fraction on the order
(g2
y m n)(1+)/2 of the stretched strings have mass less than the supergravity mass gap,
/l2. for all the positive denite mass distributions (n  4 in (12)) we have   2, so
this is still a large number of states. binding energy by denition cannot be positive,
so the existence of these states seems to contradict the existence of a mass gap. (one
way out of this is to say that because their number is suppressed by a power of the t
hooft coupling, supergravity simply misses them. it would be interesting to estimate
more carefully the  corrections in the regions of strong curvature and test whether
this escape is plausible.) second, the n = 1 distribution exhibited no mass gap in
supergravity. what aspect of the eld theory binding mechanism could be responsible
for producing a gap only when n > 1?

a possible resolution to the second question is that what supergravity measures is
not simply the correlator hooi in a particular state on the coulomb branch, but rather
the averaged quantity hooi, where the averaging is over all discrete distributions of
n d3-branes which are consistent with the continuous distribution . say  is a p-
dimensional distribution in the transverse 6 dimensions: p = 1 for the case n = 1,
where the d3-branes are distributed along a line segment; p = 2 for n = 2, where
the d3-branes are distributed over a disk; and p = 3 for n = 3 and n = 4, where the
branes are distributed in a 3-dimensional ball or across the surface of an s3. intuitively
speaking, the branes are allowed to move a distance comparable to the nearest-neighbor
distance, /n 1/p. the suggestion advanced in [6] is that averaging over the ensemble of
brane distributions that we get by allowing individual d3-branes to wiggle a distance
/n 1/p leads to an altered lagrangian which includes trace-squared terms. the guess is

to my knowledge this was rst proposed by j. polchinski.

that these terms are suciently dominant for n > 2 to give rise to a discrete spectrum,
but are insignicant for n < 2. a naive estimate is that their coecient would go
as n 12/p, as compared to 1 for the usual terms in the n = 4 lagrangian. i would
emphasize however the speculative nature of this idea. no successful calculation has
been carried out to verify that ensemble averaging could change the behavior of the
greens functions so radically.

the one universal result in non-conformal examples of the ads/cft correspondence is
a(r)d1 is monotonic in
the c-theorem. in supergravity it says that the function c(r) =
r for the metric (1) in d+1 non-compact bulk dimensions. this is simply a consequence
of the null energy condition, which is satised for all types of matter that arise in string
theory (with the possible exception of orientifold planes, where there is a formally
negative tension). in eld theory, c(r) serves as a useful approximate guide to the
number of degrees of freedom.
it is approximate partly because supergravity only
knows about the leading order in n, but mostly because the correspondence between
radius and energy scale is not known precisely except in the case of pure ads5. when
the geometry approaches ads5, c(r) is a constant proportional to the trace anomaly
coecients in the conformal eld theory. this and its monotonicity make it the best
candidate we have for a c-function in the ads/cft context.

there is a ve-parameter family of states on the coulomb branch of n = 4 super-
yang-mills theory which admits a dual description wholly in terms of d = 5 n = 8
gauged supergravity. these are states where the vevs of the operators tr x(i xj)
are adjusted arbitrarily. the vevs of all the other symmetric traceless products can
best be calculated by raising the ve-dimensional solution up to ten dimensions via
the consistent truncation ansatz. the ve-dimensional geometries provide examples of
ows where c(r) goes to zero, either smoothly as r   or sharply at a nite value
of r. we understand this qualitatively as reecting the fact that at lower energies, fewer
of the massive stretched string excitations are available. however the characteristic
energy scale of correlators calculated in the supergravity geometry is /l2: smaller
by a factor of qg2
y m n than the characteristic energy scale of the higgs vevs which
dene the coulomb state. strong gauge interactions could be responsible for color
singlet combinations of bps stretched string states giving up most of their mass to
binding energy. i have suggested that averaging over ensembles of brane distributions
may also play a role in determining the qualitative features of the spectra and their
remarkable dependence on the dimension of the distribution.
