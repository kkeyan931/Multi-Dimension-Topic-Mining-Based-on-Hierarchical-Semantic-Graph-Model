abstract

the type 0 string theory is considered as a dual model of a non-supersymmetric

gauge theory. a background geometry with n electric d3-branes is calculated in uv/ir

regions. in this paper, we study a d5-brane around n d3-branes from the d5-brane world

volume action as in the type iib case, and we obtain some baryon congurations at uv/ir

regions.

1. introduction

from the ads/cft correspondence, the type iib string theory with large n d3-
branes is believed to be a dual model of the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory, and a
baryon conguration is realized as a d5-brane wrapped on s5 in the type iib theory [1][2].
in [3], the d5-brane world volume action is studied and the static solution is analysed. it

has a spike, where the tension (the energy per unit radial coordinate distance) is equal to

that of n fundamental strings [4]. it is a bound state of n quarks, that is a baryon.

recently a type 0 string theory has been considered as a dual model of a non-

supersymmetric gauge theory [5]. the type 0 string theory has two ns-ns and two

r-r sectors and is classied into two types of models [6] ,

type 0a :

type 0b :

(ns, ns)  (ns+, ns+)  (r+, r)  (r, r+) ,
(ns, ns)  (ns+, ns+)  (r+, r+)  (r, r) .

the signs () represent chiralities and the (ns, ns) sector has tachyon t . but after
tachyon condensation, tachyon mass squared is shifted by the ve-form eld strength.

since there are two r-r sectors, rr elds are two sets, electric and magnetic.

in the type 0b theory, the system with large n electric d3-branes is studied in [7]

[8] [9]. the metric is set in a form

and this also describes ads5  s5 geometry.

in section 2 we study the d5-brane world volume action in the n electric d3-brane

background in the uv/ir regions and analyse the behavior of the tension at a spike.

section 3 is devoted to some comments about the baryon conguration.

2. the d5-brane world volume action

we consider the action of a d5-brane wrapped on s5. the d5-brane world volume

action consists of the born-infeld action and the wz term. since the born-infeld action

in the type 0 string theory is given in [5][10] , we can write down d5-brane world volume

action

2(cid:17)ep det(gab + fab) + t5z a(1)  dc(4) ,

where gab(= g ax bx ) is an induced metric, fab(= da(1)) is a u(1) gauge eld
strength on the d5-brane and c(4) is a four-form eld. the  = (t, , 1, 2, 3, 4) is a
world volume coordinate of the d5-brane embedded on s5. for simplicity we consider an
so(5) isometry in the s5 and a static solution as [3] . let  and at depend only on  and
all other elds be zero. in this setup the action (2.1) becomes

s = t54z dtd sin4 e2nh(cid:16) t

(2.2)

where  denotes the  derivative and 4(= 82

at

qe52 + e  (at)2

partially integrating (2.2) , substituting (2.4) into it and changing sign, we evaluate the

action (2.2) in the tree level

e = t54z dqe52 + eqk()2 + h2 sin8 e24 .

(2.5)

this depends only on the  eld.

2.1. the uv region

at the uv limit (  0) eq.(2.5) is expressed by using eq.(1.4) as

t54z dpv2 + v2rk()2 +

q2
4

h(cid:16)

and eq.(2.3) is written as

k() = 4ru v

4 sin4  .

(2.6)

(2.7)

since the right hand side of (2.7) is a function of only  not , k() is solvable and is

determined as

k() = ru v

k() 

4k() ,

(  ) +

where 0 <  < 1 is an integral constant. these results are similar to those in the type

iib case [3] , where  = 0 corresponds to the baryon vertex and the spike sticking out at

3

 =  has the tension equal to that of the n fundamental strings. so in this paper mainly

we concentrate on the tension at  = 0 and  = . then eq.(2.6) implies that the tension
at  =  is t54|k()| = t54ru v

next we consider in the near uv region (  1). from eqs.(1.3) and (2.3) , the

behavior of the k() is given as

k() = e2+k() ,

where gs = e is the string coupling. substituting (1.3) into (2.5) , we can evaluate the

these imply that the tension of the d5-brane at  =  and  = 0 is expressed as1

(2.9)

note that this tension includes a coupling constant gs and seems almost zero because

the leading eective gravity solution (1.3) is asymptotically free in the uv region,

gs = e = 215q1( ln )2 39

but it is not a problem. the d5-branes tension [5] ,

t5 =

2(2)5(ls)6gs

,

(2.10)

where ls is the string length, has also an inverse coupling. so eects of the couplings are

canceled and the tension does not become almost zero in the uv region. the behavior of

(2.9) is shown in g. 1 .

g. 1 the behavior of p() in the uv region   1 .

8(ln )2

in g. 1, the (a) is the leading order approximation of p(), that is, 1  39 ln( ln )7
and the (b) represents the second order approximation of p() , that is, 1 39 ln( ln )7
+
1521(ln( ln ))21092 ln( ln )+317
. in the type iib case, the tension is constant since the
radii of s5 and ads5 are independent of . on the other hand in the type 0 case, the
tension is not constant and ows as shown in g. 1 since the radii of s5 and ads5 depend
on  [7] . the (a) implies that there exist two points  = 0, and  = exp( exp( 7
39 )) 
0.302219, where p() = 1. the latter point is an interesting and non trivial point, but it is
less credible since in this section the   1 region is analyzed. in fact this point vanishes
in the second order approximation in the (b). from these analyses, we conclude that the

2 ln 

2 ln 

tension increases away from the uv limit. we will give more comments in section 3.

2.2. the ir region

since at the ir limit the metric (1.6) describes ads5  s5 geometry as in the uv

limit, the similar behavior will occur also in the ir region.

at the ir limit (  ) the action (2.2) is calculated by eq.(1.6)

z dpv2 + v2rk()2 +

q2
8

h(0)2 sin8  ,

(2.11)

and eq.(2.3) is expressed as

k() = 4rir

4 sin4  .

5

(2.12)

in the same way as the uv case, we concentrate on the tension at  =  with  = 0. then

eq.(2.11) implies that the tension at the spike is t54rir

4 3

2 . since the rir, ru v have

the following expressions,

ru v

4 =

q

gs, rir

4 =

22

gs

(2.13)

the ratio of tensions at the uv and the ir limits is tured out to be 12

.

next we consider at the near ir region (  1) . substituting (1.5) into (2.3) , we

obtain the asymptotic form of the k()

(2.14)

note that this tension seems to diverge apparently since the string coupling gs behaves

but for the same reason as the uv case, the coupling gs is canceled with the one in the

in g. 2 there are also two points  =  and numerically  = 2.08581  104, where

reliable, because the ir region has a very large coupling and the perturbative analysis is

no longer credible.

3. discussion

in this paper we studied the static solution of d5-brane worldvolume action in the

uv/ir regions in the background with large n electric d3-branes.

in the type iib case a relation r4 = 4gsn ls

4 is satised, where r is the radius of
ads5 and s5 and the n is the number of d3-branes. this number comes from the action
2) associated with the ve form eld strength. on the other hand,

r d10xg(    1

5! f5

at the uv limit of the type 0b, a relation ru v

4 = q

2 gs is obtained from eq.(1.4) up to

normalization and the ve form eld strength appears in the action [5] , in a form,

z d10xg(cid:16)    f (t )

1
5!

f5

2(cid:17) .

this reads that f (t ) 1
same normalization as the type iib case, we can calculate the ru v

2 contributes to n in the type 0 case (cf. (1.2) ). so using the

4 as,

4 = 42gsn ls

ls

4 .

(3.1)

ru v

4 = 4gs

n

f (1) 1

in the same way for the ir limit, we obtain

rir

4 = 4gs

n

f (0) 1

2

4 = 4gsn ls

4 .

ls

(3.2)

eqs.(3.1) and (3.2) are consistent with the (2.13) . then from eqs.(2.10) and (3.1) , the

tension becomes

t54ru v

4|k()| =

n
2ls

2 = n tf ,

where tf is a tension of a fundamental string. this corresponds to the bound state of n
quarks in su(n ) gauge theory, i.e. a baryon. as mentioned in section 2.1, in the uv region,

there exist two points, the uv limit point  = 0 and the non trivial one ( = 0.268067),

where the tension is equal to n tf . but the latter is less credible, because eq.(2.9) is
reliable only in small  region and in fact the second point disappears in the analysis

including the second order approximation. it would be interpreted as some perturbative

eects.

since in the ir limit, from eqs.(2.10) and (3.2) , we obtain the formula of tension,

t54rir

4|k()| =

n

22ls

2 =

n
2

tf .

in this case, the number of fundamental strings is not integer and this state is not a

standard baryon.

it may represent some quantum eects in such a connement region

with a strong coupling.

if the ow of tension is connected smoothly from the uv limit to the ir limit, there

must exist at least one point where a baryon conguration with n quarks is realised, since

the ow increases near the uv limit. but we are not able to determine this interesting

point exactly, since the full metric of d3-brane background has not been known yet and

we cannot discuss how the uv solution is connected with the ir solution. if the full metric

is found, the behavior of that non trivial point will be claried.

though in this paper the background with only the n electric d3-branes is discussed,

this method will be applicable to more general backgrounds, for example, a model with n
electric and n magnetic d3-branes, in which case the dual theory is an su(n )su(n )
yang-mills theory [11] [12] .
