we dene gravitational mass in asymptotically de sitter space-times with compactied dimension.
although it is shown that the mass can be negative for space-time with matter spreading over super-
horizon scale or large outward momentum in four dimension, we give simple examples with negative
energy in higher dimensions even if the matter is not over horizon or system does not have large
momentum. they does not have lower bound on the mass. we also give positive energy argument
in higher dimension and conclude that elementary fermion cannot exists in our examples.

i. introduction

superstring or m-theory may promise the proper theory of gravity [1]. almost of all theory is formulated in higher

dimensions and it is believed that the extra dimension space will be compactied to be less than planck length.

the stability of such space-times is important and has been discussed and found the instanton which may indicate
decay of kaluza-klein vacuum [2] [3] [4]. as witten pointed out by himself, decay mode is excluded by the existence
of (massless) elementary fermion related to supersymmetry [5].

on the other hand, stability of the asymptotically anti-de sitter(ads) space-time with compactied dimension has
been focused recently by horowitz & myers [6] because ads/cft correspondence [7] links the stability of yang-mills
theory to that of ads space-time. so they suggested a positive energy conjecture in locally asymptotically ads
space-times.

in the actual cosmological context, same argument of stability may be important. in this paper, for simplicity, we
consider d-dimensional einstein gravity with a positive cosmological constant. a positive cosmological constant is
essential for ination universe [8] and acceleration of universe conrmed gradually by recent observations of supernovae
[9]. in nakao et als study, it was shown that the gravitational mass can be negative in four dimensional space-times
when the matter distributes over the cosmological horizon scale [10].
in other words, the mass is negative if the
space-times has large outward momentum. evaluating the electric part of weyl tensor, they also checked that the
mass is associated to gravitational tidal force. in this paper, we nd a initial data set whose mass can be negative
and does not have lower bound even if the space-time does not have momentum. furthermore, we give an other
dynamical solution which also does not have momentum.

the rest of the present paper is organised as follows. in the next section, we give the denition of gravitational mass
in asymptotically de sitter space-time with extra dimensions and write down the expression in terms of canonical
quantities on the hypersurface. since this is straightforward extension of work by nakao et al [10] based on [11] [12], we
give only brief discussion. then we point out the expression is special case of the gravitational hamiltonian discussed
by hawking & horowitz [13]. in sec. 3, we show two examples having negative energy without singularity. in sec.

4, we consider positive energy theorem to discuss the stability of de sitter space-time and conrm that elementary
fermion cannot exist in examples listed by us. finally, we give summary in sec. 4.

ii. gravitational mass in asymptotically de sitter space-times with higher

dimensions

we consider d-dimensional space-times which satisfy einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant ,

rij 

1
2

gij r + gij = 8gdtij ,

(2.1)

where suces i, j runs over 0, 1, ..., d  1, tij is the energy-momentum tensor and gd is d-dimensional newtons
constant. we decompose the metric as follows,

gij = gij + hij ,

(2.2)

where gij is the metric of d-dimensional de sitter space-time and hij is the rest. we remember that hij is not linear
perturbation quantity in general.

here we note that einstein equation is written as

rij
 

1
2

gijr  hij = (g)1/2t ij ,

(2.3)

where hij = gik gjlhkl, rij

in t ij of the right-hand side. as the left-hand side of eq. (2.3) satises bianchi identity, we see that

is the linear part of hij of ricci tensor rij and all higher order quantities are contained

(2.4)
holds, where i is the covariant derivative associated with gij . contracted t ij with the killing vector of de sitter
space-time,

it ij = 0

we obtain

t i = t ij j ,

it i = 0.

thus, r dd1xt 0 is conserved if the surface term r dd2sit i vanishes. this expression is given by

1

ead =

=

8gd z dd1xt 0k k
8gd z dd2si[ i k 0ijm  k 0jji j] j ,

1

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

where k ijkl = (1/2)(gilh kj + gkj h il  gikh jl  gjlh ik), h ij = hij  (1/2)gijhk
k and i = 1, 2, ..., d  1.
in the case that i is a timelike killing vector ead is regarded as the killing energy, the so called abbott-deser(ad)
mass.

next, we rewrite eq. (2.7) in a familiar form in order to obtain its physical meaning. first of all, we need take
care to treat asymptotic region. in the case of asymptotic at, the extrinsic curvature kij of a slice has behaviour
k i
j  0 toward spatial innity i0. as we know, we can expect that such slice does not have asymptotic region in
asymptotically de sitter space-time because static slice with kij = 0 has no boundary in de sitter space-time. so we
remember that the at chart of de sitter space-time has boundary and its spatial metric is conformally at. thus,
we realize that the most natural condition is k i
the background de sitter space-time is written as

j or k  (d  1)h [14], where h = p2/(d  1)(d  2).

j  hi

g = dt2 + a(t)2

d1

xi=1

dx2
i ,

(2.8)

where a(t) = eht. in this chart, the killing vector has the component m = (1, hxi). after simple calculations, we
obtain

ead = a(t)(cid:16)eadm + padm( )(cid:17)

a(t)

k) 

a(t)

8gd z d sihk i

j  ki

j + (d  2)hi

jij,

(2.9)

where kij is the extrinsic curvature of t =constant (d  1)-dimensional hypersurface. using the momentum ij =
kij  qijk, where qij is the metric of t =constant hypersurface, the second term in the second line of eq. (2.9) can
be expressed by

padm( ) = padm( )  padm( ) = 

1

8gd z d si(i

j  i

j) j .

(2.10)

obviously, ead can be written in terms of the adm energy and net momentum. we note that the momentum of
background de sitter space-time is subtracted automatically.

now we compare the above expression with the gravitational energy dened via physical hamiltonian [13]. this

has expression

ehh = 

1

8gd z ds(n k  n k) +

1

8gd z ds(n iij  n i ij )rj .

(2.11)

the physical hamiltonian is the original one subtracted by hamiltonian of a background space-time. as hawking
& horowitz showed, the rst term of eq. (2.11) is just adm energy. compared eq. (2.9) with eq. (2.11), one can
see that these has same except for scale factor, ead = a(t)ehh, if one chooses lapse function and the shift vector as
follows,

n = n = 1

and

n i = n i =  i.

(2.12)

however, it is likely that the priority is in our denition because hawking & horowitzs construction of physical
hamiltonian is articial.

in asymptotically at case, the adm energy is dened by view point of a static observer with n = 1 and n i = 0
at spatial innity i0. the naturalness of observer selection to dene the energy is related to the timelike translation
symmetry at innity. on the other hand, in asymptotically de sitter space, we must consider hypersurface which have
innity in order to dene the non-zero energy. as we have done, the most convenient slices is one which corresponds
to the at slices in de sitter space-time. this slices reach into the timelike innity i+. however, the slices is
not associated with the timelike translation symmetry which de sitter space-time possesses, that is, the slice is not
orthogonal to timelike killing vector. thus, it may be natural that adm momentum term enters into the expression
of the mass.

in four dimension ad mass can be negative when system has large outward momentum [10]. on the other hand, the
positivity of ad or adm mass is guaranteed for system without the net momentum, padm = 0, in four dimension
[15].

iii. examples in five dimensions

as same with case of four dimension, ad mass can be negative regardless of the compactication of the extra
dimension. however, physical reason of the negativity is dynamics of space-time, rather than the (quantum) stability.
now our interest in just stability. so, we consider only case which the contribution of adm momentum does not
exist. we give two examples in ve dimension which have are regular everywhere and have negative energy.

let us consider an initial slice with kij = hgij and h = p/6. in this slice hamiltonian constraint becomes
(4)r = 0. one can see easily that euclidian reissner-nordstrom metric with imaginary charge ie satises and then
it is one of solutions [4]. this metric is given by

(4)g = v (r)d2 +

dr2
v (r)

+ r2d2
2

(3.1)

where v (r) = 1  2m/r  e2/r2 and r  r+ := m + m2 + e2. to avoid a conical singularity at r = r+, we impose

the period p = 4/v (r+) = 2r2

+/(r+  m) in the direction .

3

on the present slice, the mass is constituted by adm energy component, ead = eadm = mp/2g5 = m/2. by
same argument with brill & horowitz [4], the mass becomes negative and does not have the lower bound. the mass
can be set to be arbitrary negative regardless of the radius of the compactied space. however, as we see in the second
example, it is not obvious whether ad energy is conserved or not in the course of time development.

as a second example, we take a dynamical solution [16]. the metric is

ds2 = dt2 + a(t)2h d2



2i,
+ dr2 + r22d2

(3.2)

j = hi
where (r) = 1  m/r and a(t) = eht. the t =constant hypersurface has the extrinsic curvature k i
j.
however, this has timelike naked singularity at r = m. since the expansion of outgoing null geodesics congruence is

+ =

1

2(cid:16)2h +

4r  m
2a3/2r2(cid:17),

(3.3)

apparent horizon does not exist in expanding chart with a = eht. in collapsing chart with a = eht, apparent horizon
also does not exist although surfaces such that + = 0 exists. the curvature invariant is given by

rijklrijkl = 5h 4 + 3hh 2 

m

2a2(r  m)3i2

+hh 2 

m

a2(r  m)3i2

.

(3.4)

to avoid naked this singularity at r = m, we take m  m. in this case, the radial coordinate r runs up to r = 0

and the conical singularity occurs at r = 0 in general cases. near r = 0, the metric is written as

ds2  dt2 + a(t)2h r

m

d2 +

m
r

2i,
dr2 + m2d2

where a(t) = eht and h = p/6. here we introduce a new coordinate r = (rm)1/2 and the metric is

ds2  dt2 + a2h4ndr2 + r2d(cid:16) 

2m(cid:17)2o + m2d2
2i.

(3.5)

(3.6)

hence, the metric is regular everywhere except for a = 0 singularity if one assumes the period p = 4m in -
direction. the physical size of the compactied dimensions is given by 4a(t)m. thus, it decreases/increases if one
takes collapsing/expanding chart. best we can do is choosing the collapsing chart in physical aspect. in this chart,
we can keep the radius of the compactied space to be less than planck length. the ad mass is

e = eadm = 

a(t)3mp

g5

= a3(t)m.

(3.7)

this is not conserved! this comes from the non-vanishing boundary term. in the collapsing chart, we observe the
energy approaches zero.

iv. positive energy theorem, elementary fermion and stability

in locally asymptotically at case with compactied dimension, the break down of positive energy theorem means
non-existence of the witten spinor [5]. in supergravity side, there are not supersymmetry because the spinor is related
to innitesimal generator of local supersymmetry [17].

in asymptotically de sitter case, the situation is dierent from the above. as we stated, the energy can be negative
even if the extra dimension is not compactied. in this section, we discuss positive energy theorem followed by [15]
[18]  in cases whose extra dimension is not compactied. from the procedure of the proof, we can see easily that the
witten spinor cannot exist for examples in the previous section.

following kastor&traschen [18], we dene the cosmological supercovariant derivative operator on a spinor  as

here we used the fact that ve dimensional newtons constant is written as g5 = pg4 by four dimensional one.
the argument in ref. [15] is prototype of the proof. the excellent approach bearing supergravity in mind was given in ref. [18].
however, both papers have not been attained at the present rened result. see ref. [19] for asymptotically ads space-times.

(4.1)

(4.3)

the solution is given by a constant spinor 0 satisfying 00 = i0 in expanding at slice of de sitter space-time.

using bianchi identity, hamiltonian and momentum constraints, we obtain an identity

z dsi i = z dvh| i|2 + 4gd(t00 + ti0i0)i

(4.4)

let us evaluate the left-hand side. we follow wittens argument [20] carefully. first, the constant spinor satises

(4.6)

if we suppose k = (d  1)h + o(1/rd1), the same argument of the existence of solution with asymptotic at holds
and we obtain

using the decomposition (4.6) of the spin connection, we obtain the familiar expression

0|0|2 = o(1/rd3) due to 00 = i0. this

j = o(1/rd2) lead us that the momentum term padm(00) vanishes. finally we obtain inequality

e =

4gd z dsi i
= a(t)eadm|0|2  0

(4.9)

under dominant energy condition [21] on energy momentum tensor tij . unfortunately, we can say nothing about e =
0 case because witten spinor approaching to 0 at innity is uniquely determined. thus, there is not contradiction
with the existence of non-trivial solution which has zero adm mass and is given in the rst one inside ref. [10].

 the vector i = i  dened by spinor  satisfying i  = 0 is conformal killing vector, not killing vector in de sitter
space-time. that it,  is a conformal killing spinor, not killing spinor. this point is main reason why one cannot prove the
positivity of ad mass for asymptotically de sitter space-times having the net momentum because the left-hand side of eq. (4.4)
cannot be ad mass.
in asymptotically at space-times, 0 is arbitrary constant spinor. this means the existence of ds independent solution of
witten equation. as a result, we obtain rijkl = 0 from 0 = [i, j] = (1/4)rijkl[k , l].

5

we can see that e is not equal to ad mass, ead. when k i

j = o(1/rd1) holds and momentum term of ad mass
vanishes, ad mass equals to adm energy and the positivity is guaranteed. for our purpose, it is worth imposing
k i
j = o(1/rd1) because we are interest in the stability of space-time, not its dynamics. as eq. (4.9) this implies
the positivity of ad mass. the apparent contradiction with examples given in the previous section indicates that the
witten spinor does not exist in such examples.

v. summary

in this paper we dene the gravitational mass in asymptotically de sitter space-time with extra dimension and obtain
a rened expression related to adm energy and momentum associated to timelike killing vector of the background
de sitter space-time. furthermore, we show one dynamical solution and one initial data with the negative energy in
ve dimensions. does these solution indicate the quantum decay of de sitter space-time? we cannot reply to the
question instantly because we do not know whether the instanton exists or not. naively speaking, we can guess from
the previous section that decay occurs unless one imposes the existence of elementary fermion or supersymmetry.

finally, we should mention that the energy seems to depend on time in general although the denition is reasonable.

this means that the contribution from the boundary is not negligible.
