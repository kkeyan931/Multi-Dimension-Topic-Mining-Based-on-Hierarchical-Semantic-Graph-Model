abstract

we give full details for the computation of the kaluzaklein mass spectrum of
type iib supergravity on ads5  t 11, with t 11 = su (2)  su (2)/u (1), that has
recently lead to both stringent tests and interesting predictions on the ads5/cf t4
correspondence for n = 1 scfts [1]. we exhaustively explain how kk states
arrange into su (2, 2|1) supermultiplets, and stress some relevant features of the t 11
manifold, such as the presence of topological modes in the spectrum originating from
the existence of nontrivial 3cycles. the corresponding betti vector multiplet is
responsible for the extra baryonic symmetry in the boundary cf t . more generally,
we use the simple t 11 coset as a laboratory to revive the technique and show the
power of kk harmonic expansion, in view of the present attempts to probe along
the same lines also m theory compactications and the ads4/cf t3 map.

1 introduction

pactied on the product of ads5 spacetime and the coset manifold t 11 =

knowledge of the full kaluzaklein (kk) mass spectrum of type iib supergravity com-
su(2)  su(2)
has recently been crucially used to perform accurate spectroscopic tests as weel as obtain
many new predictions [1] on the ads/cf t correspondence [2] by comparison with a
specic n = 1, fourdimensional scft [3].

u(1)

although partial results concerning the t 11 laplacian [4], the rstorder operators
acting on fermions and on the 2form [5] were already quite inspiring, only from studying
every sector of the spectrum one can fully analyse the multiplet structure and shortening
patterns that allow to establish a precise mapping between kk states and conformal
operators in the boundary eld theory.

while the focus in [1] was on the ads/cf t correspondence, this paper is totally
devoted to the techniques involved in performing harmonic analysis on t 11, that were
just touched in that previous work.

harmonic analysis, applied to the kk reduction of higher supergravity theories, has
been thoroughly developed in the past (see [6, 7, 8, 9] and references therein). nowadays,
it seems to live a new youth, especially in connection with the basic role played by all
ads compactied supergravity, and particularly of mtheory .

the t 11 manifold provides a simple and eective example of coset manifold with killing
spinors that can be used to show the general theory of computing kk spectra at work.
thus we briey expose it here in the essential steps without any claim for mathematical
rigour. this can perhaps make more evident points presented in [1] and might be of some
help to those who are not aware of the method.

since we determine the full kk spectrum, we organize it in su(2, 2|1) supermultiplets
and discuss some interesting features arising in this kind of analysis, we think that this
paper could provide a selfcontained reference for analogous computations in dierent
examples of kk harmonic expansion that are nowadays under investigation, such as m
theory on ads4  m7 [10], with m7 being either m 111 spaces [11, 12, 13, 14], the real
stiefel manifold v(5,2) [15] or the n 010 and q111 spaces [16].

the strength of our analysis lies in the fact that, in view of the ads/cf t correspon-
dence, our results provide an accurate check of the eld theory independently derived
by orbifold resolution techniques [3, 17, 18]. this is not the case for the ads4/cf t3
correspondence, where the supergravity side can be deeply investigated and is partly well
known, while the relevant threedimensional conformal eld theories are not still un-
derstood, although there is some work in this direction [19, 20, 21]. the kk analisys
acquires than a prominent position, since it can give us the right hints for building such
dual cfts.

beside the harmonic analysis and the kk mass spectrum, we also give some emphasis
to the existence on t 11 of a betti vector multiplet [13, 23], that is a gauge vector

2

multiplet which is a singlet of the full isometry group su(2)  su(2)  ur(1) and whose
presence is related to the nontrivial betti numbers b2 = b3 = 1 on t 11. as already
observed in [1, 25], the existence of such kind of multiplets is related to the possibility
of wrapping a pbrane (p = 3 in our case) on the nontrivial pcycles of the internal
manifold.

a new feature of our vedimensional theory is that there appears not only the single
vector eld associated to the nontrivial 3form, but, as we will see, there is also a tensor
and a scalar eld, which are part of a betti tensor and a betti hypermultiplet respectively.
in section 2 we review in some more detail with respect to previous papers the geometry
of t pq and specically of t 11 (which turns out to be the only supersymmetric one in the
family where the integers p and q dene the possible embeddings of the u(1) in the
denominator), establishing conventions and notations. in section 3 we give our essential
resume of harmonic expansion on a general coset manifold, giving at each step of the
construction, the application to our specic manifold. the kk procedure for t 11 is then
worked out and the mass spectrum thoroughly computed in section 4. in section 5 we
explain how to reconstruct the supermultiplets of su(2, 2|1) from the eigenvalues of the
invariant dierential operators and from the group theoretical knowledge of the su(2, 2|1)
representations. in section 6 we recall the main properties of the betti multiplets as they
were rst introduced in [23] and we discuss their explicit form in our specic case.

we also present three appendices. in the appendix a notations and conventions are
collected, while in appendix b we show how to compute the dierential operators on a
coset manifold in a purely algebraic way, which is the heart of the general method for
computing mass spectra in kk theories, and nally in appendix c we list the tables of
the various multiplets of the theory.

the t pq spaces [26] are the coset manifolds

where the uh(1) generator th is embedded in the two su(2) factors as the linear combi-
nation

(p, q  n, coprime)
where t3 and t3 generate u(1) subgroups of the two su(2) in g.

th  p t3 + q t3

(2.1)

to describe the geometry of these varieties, we can take two copies of the su(2)

algebra with generators4 ta, ta, (a = 1 . . . 3):

[ta, tb] = ab

[ ta, tb] = ab

become the corresponding mces for leftinvariant forms on the coset g/h. the linear

dual to th dened in (2.1) can be identied as the hconnection of g/h, while ei, er
and the orthogonal combination

e5 =

p e3  q e3
p2 + q2

(2.7)

can be identied with the ve vielbeins spanning the cotangent space to g/h.

we do not dwell with general values of p and q because we are interested only in t pq
spaces endowed with supersymmetry and it has been shown in [26] that this happens only
if p = q = 1. thus we take

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

where a, b, c are real rescaling factors which will be determined by requiring that t 11 be
an einstein space [8, 27]. using (2.12) in (2.5a)(2.5b) and (2.10)(2.11), we get the full
set of mces of t 11 for the vielbein v a and the hconnection

this xes the square of the rescalings and thus their absolute value, but not their sign.
we will see that this is going to be determined by supersymmetry requirement.

before proceeding, we would like to briey mention an alternative approach for de-
scribing the geometry of the t 11 manifold developed in [27] and used for example in [4].
if we decompose the su(2) su(2) lie algebra g with respect to the th generator as g
= h + k, where h is made of the single th generator and the coset algebra k contains
the ti, ts and t5 generators, the commutation relations between the g generators are

3 harmonic expansion

3.1 the general theory

in this chapter we give a resume of the general theory of harmonic expansion on coset
manifolds (see e.g. [6, 7, 8, 9, 14] and references therein) adapt the general formulae to
our specic case, namely compactication of type iib supergravity on the t 11 manifold.
in kaluzaklein theories, we are faced with the problem of computing the mass spec-
trum of a ddimensional model compactied down to d  d dimensions, d being the
dimensions of a compact space, usually of the form of a coset g/h.

we take the spacetime to be adsdd, i.e. anti de sitter space in d  d dimensions.
the rst thing to do is to compute the uctuations of the ddimensional elds around
a particular background [12, 23] which, in spontaneous compactications, turns out to be
a solution of the ddimensional theory equations of motion. after the linearisation of
the ddimensional equations of motion has been performed, we are left, for each eld of
the theory, with an equation of the type:

(2{j}x + []

y ){j}[](x, y) = 0.

(3.1)

where 2 and
are the kinetic operators in the ads spacetime (xcoordinates) and in
the compact space (ycoordinates). the label {j} denotes the adsdd quantum numbers
of the eld (scalar, vector, spinor, etc.), while the so(d) representation in the tangent
space to g/h is labeled by the corresponding young diagram5 []  [1, . . . , [d/2]].

the important thing about (3.1) is that the dierential operator symbolically denoted
is a laplacebeltrami operator on g/h. this means that, beside being invariant
by
under g, its eigenfunctions, the harmonics on g/h, dene a complete set of functions for
the elds [](y) on g/h and, for each eigenvalue, they span an irreducible representation
of g.

[]
y

the invariant operators

can all be constructed in terms of the (at) covariant
derivatives da (a = 1, . . . d) on g/h and the invariant gtensors. let us give a list of
these operators for various irrepses h1, . . . , [d/2]i appearing in the kk compactication6

yy[0,0,...,0]  2y,
yy[1,0,...,0]  2dad[ayb],

yy[1,...,1,0,...0]  (p + 1)dap+1d[a1ya2...ap+1],

yy[2,0,...,0]  3dcd(cyab),

yy[1/2,1/2,...,1/2]  d/ ,
yy[3/2,1/2,...,1/2]  abc db c.

(3.2a)

(3.2b)

(3.2c)

(3.2d)

(3.2e)

(3.2f)

5we will mostly omit the {j} and [] labels when not necessary.
6symmetrisation and antisymmetrisation are understood with weight one; we do not write explicitly

the spinor index on the spinor harmonics:   .

7

note that all the laplacebeltrami operators are either secondorder dierential oper-
ators acting on the bosonic harmonics y (which can be expressed in terms of the covariant
laplacian 2 on g/h plus curvature terms) or they are the rstorder operators acting
on spinor harmonics  (in this case they can be expressed in terms of the dirac operator
d/ on g/h).

we point out that for particular values of the internal space dimension d = 2k + 1,
the laplacebeltrami operator acting on a kform can be written in terms of the rst
order operator d. for example, in d = 5, the laplacebeltrami operator on the 2forms
yabv av b is

abcdedcy de v av b,

(3.3)

yy[1,1]  dyabv av b =

1
2

and the usual secondorder operator is simply the square of the rstorder one.

to dene the harmonics we start from the fundamental equation for the coset repre-

sentative l(y) of g/h:

(3.4)
where g  g, h  h and y, y are two points of g/h related by the g transformation. in
a given grepresentation id of indices m, n we can rewrite (3.4) as follows

gl(y) = l(y)h(y, g)

id(g)m

nidn(l(y))ki = idm(l(y))hiid(h(y, g))hi

ki

(3.5)

where the ndimensional range of the indices m, n of the representation space of id(h) has
been fragmented into subsets hi corresponding to their ith irreducible fragment; in other
words, if {} identies the grepresentation and {i} identies one of the irreducible
hrepresentations according to the branching rule

{}  {1}  {2}  . . .  {m},

(3.6)

then we have

m = {h1, . . . , hm},

hi = 1, . . . , ni,

hi = dimid.

(3.7)

m

x1

we now dene as irreducible harmonics

hy {}

{i}

(y)im

hi  idm

hi(l1(y)).

(3.8)

the functions y ()m
, for xed {i}, are a complete set of functions for the expansion of
{i}hi
a eld hi(y) on g/h, where hi(y) transforms in the irrep {i} of h. however, in kk,
the ddimensional physical elds also depend on the spacetime coordinates x, so that a
generic eld hi(x, y), transforming in the irrep {i}, can be expanded as

hi(x, y) =x{}xm

{}mhi(x)(y {}(y))m
hi.

(3.9)

8

where for notational simplicity we have suppressed the index i referring to the particular
hrepresentation.

once the grepresentation {} is xed we can still have a state degeneration. indeed
there are cases in which the same grepresentation, with the same h quantum numbers
can be obtained in many ways. in such cases the correct eld expansion (3.9) is replaced
by

hi(x, y) =x{}xm x

{}

mhi (x)(y {}(y))m
hi,

(3.10)

where  counts the state degeneracy.

we now exemplify the previous discussion with our specic case, where the coset is g/h = (su (2)
su (2))/uh(1) and dim(g/h) = 5. thus {} is identied with (j, l), the quantum numbers of the
su (2)  su (2) irreducible representations, and {i} is identied with the charge qi of the ith one
dimensional fragment of the branching of a given su (2)  su (2) representation under uh(1).
to be more explicit, we write a generic representation of su (2)  su (2) in the young tableaux
formalism:
(3.11)

{z

(cid:26) 2l = n1 + n2
2l3 = n2  n1

furthermore (recalling the denitions (2.1)(2.9)) we get

th y (j,l,r)
t5y (j,l,r)

(q)

(q)

= i q y (j,l,r)
= i r y (j,l,r)

(q)

 i (j3 + l3) y (j,l,r)
 i (j3  l3) y (j,l,r)

(q)

.

hence

2j3 = q + r  m2  m1,
2l3 = q  r  n2  n1.

}

.

(3.13)

(3.14)

(3.15)

it is easy to see that, given a generic {} = (j, l) grepresentation and xed the h quantum number
q, we have still the freedom to chose how to place the 1 and 2s in the boxes of the young tableaux.
we have therefore a state degeneration. to remove such a degeneration we classify the various states
by means of a fourth quantum number r which is the charge of the state under the normalizer u (1) in
h. this u (1) coincides with the rsymmetry factor in the full isometry group su (2)  su (2)  u (1).
we point out that this number is not a good quantum number for a xed representation as it is not
the same for all the qfragments appearing in the expansion of a generic (spinor) tensor, but it is useful
to determine the eigenvalues of the mass operators on the harmonics in terms of the known quantum
numbers of the isometry group.

since in this case the hi index is onedimensional, we can write the generic harmonic of t 11 as

y (j,l,r)
(qi)

(y)m and the expansion of a eld belonging to the subspace of charge (qi) as

(qi)(x, y) =x(j,l)xm xr

(j,l,r)

qi

(x)m(y (j,l,r)(y))m
qi

(3.16)

coming back to the general case, we are now in position of constructing the eigenfunc-
tions of the laplacebeltrami operators acting on the so(d) tangent group tensor and
(x, y) such a eld where []  [1, . . . , [d/2]] are
spinor elds. let us denote by 
young labels of the so(d) representation and ab . . . denote generically some tensor (or
spinor) structure of the indices. we note that h is a subgroup of so(d) (in our example
h = uh (1)  so(5)) and so we can branch [] with respect to h obtaining a set of n
irreducible representations of h

[1,...,[d/2]]
ab...

[] h {1} + {2} + . . .{n}.

(3.17)

to make this decomposition explicit we observe that if g/h is a ddimensional coset,
then h is a subgroup of so(d), its embedding being described by7

(th )m

n = ch

ab(tab)m

n

(ch

ab = chc

bca),

(3.18)

for a given so(d) representation labeled by indices m, n. in general, any so(d) repre-
sentation is fully reducible under h:

(th )m

n =

t m1n1

. . .

.




t mm nm
h

(3.19)

in particular, the vielbein v a, which is a ddimensional so(d) vector ([1, 0, . . . , 0]) can
be split into fragments transforming irreducibly under h as follows:

v a  v h1  . . .  v hn .

(3.20)

turning again to our case g/h = t 11, the set of generators of the isotropy group h = uh(1) is
a single generator which is also named th . using the su (2)  su (2) algebra given in (2.24) we nd
the following decomposition of the so(5) vector and spinor representation with respect to the one
dimensional subgroup: for the vector representation we nd

7 to simplify the notations we write (t )m

note that the vielbein v a breaks under uh (1) into ve onedimensional fragments v i = (v 1, v 2),

v s = (v 3, v 4), v 5 with uh (1) charges given respectively by (1,1); (1,1); 0.

each of the fragments appearing in (3.17) can be expanded in harmonics according to
(3.9). therefore the so(d) eld []
ab...(x, y) (where ab . . . denote a set of indices labeling
the so(d) representations according to the young symbol [] = [1, . . . , [d/2]]) can be
expanded as

it is now evident that in the above expansion the set of irrepses {} of g contributing
to the expansion are only those that, when branched with respect to h, contain at least
one of the irrepses {i} appearing in the decomposition (3.17). in other words, for some
i and j we must have {i} = {j}.

it may happen that {} contains the same {} more than once; in this case the index

 is extended to count also equivalent copies of the same {} contained in {}.

at this point we can come back to the (3.1) equation.

3.2 the mass matrix

let us now discuss in some detail the computation of the mass matrix m{}  . we want to
y as a dierential operator on the harmonics can be reduced to
show that the action of
a purely algebraic action in terms of generators of g/h and so(d).

since the laplacebeltrami operators are constructed in terms of the so(d) covariant

derivatives

(3.28)
where tab are the so(d) generators, setting b = h + m, (h is dened in the appendix
b) one can write

d = d + babtab  d + b,

where the hcovariant derivative is dened by

d = dh + m,

dh = d + h.

(3.29)

(3.30)

the usefulness of the decomposition (3.29)(3.30), lies in the fact that the action of
dh on the harmonics can be computed algebraically. indeed one has quite generally (see
appendix b)

dh = r(a)tav a.
the covariant derivative, can then be written as

d = (r(a)v a ta + m abtab).

(3.31)

(3.32)

according to the branching of the so(d) fundamental representation [1, 0, . . . , 0] of

the vielbein (3.20), we have in any grepresentation
dhi = r(i)thi + m ab

hi tab,

(3.33)

where tab are the so(d) generators (whose normalization in the vector representation is
(tab)cd = cd
ab ) and thi are the generators of the coset algebra branched with respect to
h.

in our example we have h1 = i = {1, 2}, h2 = s = {3, 4}, h3 = {5} and using (2.17)(2.18) and

(3.29)(3.30), the m matrices are

m ij = (cid:18)c

note that the second term of the right hand side of (3.36) acts on the harmonics as an
element of the so(d) lie algebra, while the rst term acts as an element of the lie algebra
of g, the isometry group.

let us now observe that the action of dhi on any harmonic is perfectly known once
we dene it on the basic harmonic l1(y) in the fundamental representation of g (if
g is an orthogonal group it is useful to consider the action of dhi on the fundamental
and spinor representations). on the basis of this observation, the evaluation of the rst
term is usually done by identifying {} with a young tableaux [1, . . . , [d/2]]. the action
of id(thi) on such a tableaux is obtained by tensoring the action of the fundamental
representation of thi on each box of the tableaux

and performing the required (anti-)symmetrisations. note that since in the fundamental
representation

j = ci k ,

(3.38)

thi can be thought as an operator destroying j
coecient (see the explicit examples of su(2)  su(2) in the sequel).

and creating k times a numerical

the evaluation of the second term in (3.36) is simpler: it is sucient to use the matrix

realization of tab in the [1, . . . , [d/2]] representation of so(d).

actually we are interested in the second order and rst order laplacebeltrami oper-

ators given in (3.2). the rst order operators can be written in terms of

ada 

n

xi=1

aidai =

n

xi=1

ai(r(i)tai + m ab

ai tab),

(3.39)

while the second order operators are all given, apart from curvature terms (which are
known from the g/h geometry), in terms of the covariant laplacian, namely:

2 = dada  xi daidai = xi

(r(i)tai + m ab

ai tab)(r(i)t ai + m ab aitab) =

= xi

(r(i)2tait ai  2r(i)taim ab aitab) + m ab

(3.40)

on an so(d) scalar harmonic which, being a so(d) singlet, is also an hsinglet, the
previous expression assumes the remarkably simple form

r(i)2tait aiy {}m

(3.41)

where y {}m

is the onedimensional so(d) and hsinglet.

formulae (3.39)(3.41) can be directly used in our example by setting a1 = {1, 2}  {i}, a2 = {3, 4} 
2 e2, identifying the tab with the so(5) generators and

{s}, a3 = {5}, r(i) = 6 e2, r(s) = 6 e2, r(5) = 9
using the values of m ab

let us now show how to compute the spectrum of the physical masses for the ads elds
appearing in the expansion (3.9). this is equivalent to compute the eigenvalues of the
laplacebeltrami operators introduced before, the physical masses being the eigenvalues
or simply related to them.

to compute the eigenvalues of a generic operator we can compute either the explicit
dim[]dim[] numerical matrix obtained from the expression of the covariant laplacian
plus curvature terms obtained from (3.2) after the action of the operators tai, tab in the
representation {i} and [] on the given harmonic has been evaluated; or, what happens
to be easier in practice, one can think of (3.39)or (3.40) as a dim[]dim[] matrix whose
entries contain the operators tai and/or tait ai. in that case we write:

3.3 harmonic analysis on t 11

having explained the general procedure in the previous section, let us now restrict our
attention to the harmonic analysis on t 11.

as we discussed in section 3.1, the rst thing to do is to consider the background
solution generating the ads5  t 11 geometry and compute the uctuations of the elds
around this solution. this latter is given by the following values of the tendimensional
elds [26]

fabcde = eabcde,
fmnpqr = emnpqr,
b = am n = 0,

ra
rm

b = 2e2a
b ,
n = 2e2m
n ,

m =  = 0,

(3.47)

where fabcde and fmnpqr are the projections on t 11 and ads5 of the tendimensional ve
form f dened as f = da4, a4 being the real selfdual fourform of type iib supergravity.
the other elds of type iib supergravity are: the metric gm n (x, y) with internal and
spacetime components gab(y), g(x) whose ricci tensors in this background are given
in (3.47) and the complex 0form and 2form b and am n (the fermionic elds m and
 are obviously zero in the background (3.47)).

to determine the kk modes, one has rst to determine the linearised eld equations
around the background (3.47) and then expand the excitations into the t 11 harmonics.
as explained in [12, 29], the general expansion can be simplied by choosing covariant
gauge conditions in the internal space.

we are not going to give a detailed derivation of the linearised equations or gauge
xing conditions for our case. the right procedure has been explained in [29] to which
we refer. there are however some subtleties and dierences arising in making the same
computations in our case which will be examined below. to be more precise, while for
most of the eld excitations we can repeat the kk expansion and impose the gauge
xing conditions as reported in [29], we have to be careful for the expansion of the modes
deriving from the fourthrank antisymmetric tensor am n p q.

(3.48d)

(3.48e)

(3.48f)

(3.48g)

(3.48h)

note that in (3.48) do not appear derivative terms in the harmonics; this is due to the
fact that using the gauge invariance freedom in the internal space, which we then x by
imposing

dah(ab) = daha = 0,
daaab = daaa = 0,

16

(3.49a)

(3.49b)

we can restrict ourselves to the transverse harmonics, namely harmonics satisfying the
condition dayab... = 0.

in an analogous way, in the harmonic expansion of the fourthrank antisymmetric

tensor uctuations (denoted by am n p q), we can choose the covariant gauge conditions

daaabcd = daaabc = daaab = daaa = 0,

(3.50)

and remove again terms with gradients from the harmonics of the various uctuations.
this means that we can expand these uctuations in kk modes ( we use the collective
index {} to denote the doublet (j, l))

b{}(x)y {}(y),

b{}(x)y {}a

(y),

b{} (x)y {}ab (y),

{} (x)y {}abc (y),

b{}(x)y {}abcd(y).

a(x, y) = x{}
aa(x, y) = x{}
aab(x, y) = x{}
aabc(x, y) =x{}
aabcd(x, y) = x{}

(3.51a)

(3.51b)

(3.51c)

(3.51d)

(3.51e)

we can achieve further simplications if we consider the duality conditions in a ve
dimensional space and the gauge conditions (3.50). from daaabcd = 0, equation (3.51e)
and since in ve dimensions a 4form is dual to a 1form, we have

abcdeddy {}e = 0,

(3.52)

now we recall that since the topology of t 11 is that of s2  s3 its betti numbers can
be easily derived through the kunneth formula from the product of those of the spheres
in the product. this tells us that there are no nontrivial onecycles and so no closed
nonexact 1forms, exactly as in the case of the s5 compactication of [29]. therefore
(3.52) implies that ye is an exact 1form. thus we can simplify the aabcd expansion to

aabcd = x{}

b{}abcd

e dey {}.

(3.53)

one could try to repeat the same procedure for the aabc eld, but here comes the
point. while this procedure is straightforward for the s5 internal space analyzed in [29],
this is not the case for the t 11 manifold. from the gauge condition daaabc = 0, equation
(3.51d) and the duality relations, we nd

but now yde can be a closed nonexact twoform since the second and third betti numbers
of t 11 are dierent from zero and in fact

abcdedcy {}de = 0,

(3.54)

b2 = b3 = 1.

17

(3.55)

this means that there exist a nonexact closed twoform on this space which can satisfy
(3.54).

in [30] it has been shown that this single betti 2form must be a gsinglet and thus
there is only the {} = {gsinglet} = {0} mode which cannot be treated as in [29]. the
aabc expansion for ads5  t 11 is therefore
aabc = x{}h{} abc

i + (0)

de ddy {}e

dey (0)
de

 abc

(3.56)

which means that the only dierence with the expansion in [29] is the last term in (3.56).
let us then analyze the consequences of this modication on the linearised equations
of motion. it is easy to see that the only equations which are aected by this change are
the (e2), (m2) and (m3) equations of [29], namely

the (3.57) and (3.59) equations now contain extra terms of the form

a

f gy 0

f g  0by 0

ab

which therefore reduce to zero due to the transversality condition on yab (dayab = 0)
deriving from the gauge conditions (3.50) applied to (3.51c).

we are left with the (3.58) equation which, after insertion of the kk modes using
(3.48)(3.51), contains in the r.h.s. a new term in the following sector (equation (m2.2)
of [29])

3[b0

] 


4



 b0

 = 2

d 0



(3.61)

where  is the eigenvalue of the rstorder operator d on the twoform (3.3) and all
the elds are in the singlet representation of the isometry group. the divergence d
of this equation makes it independent on the new 0 eld due to the obvious identity
d[d 0
] = 0, while we nd a new equation of motion for the 0 eld by contraction of
(3.61) with 

d. this yields

dd[

0
 ] = db0
 .

(3.62)

(3.62) is easily seen to correspond to a new massless vector. indeed, since b0
i.e.

mn is massive,



 = m0b0

,

db0
18

(3.63)

its divergence vanishes dsbst = 0, and (3.62) becomes

dd[ 0

 ] = 0.

(3.64)

we see that the presence of nontrivial homology cycle on our manifold implies the
presence of a massless vector in the singlet representation of the isometry group, and if
supersymmetry is present, of an entire vector multiplet named betti multiplet in [23].

now that we have discussed the linearised equations of motion, we are in position
to proceed to perform the harmonic expansion and thus to determine which irreducible
representations {} of su(2)  su(2) do occur in (3.48)(3.51).

as explained in the general setting of section 2, in order to answer this question a
preliminary step is to analyze the branching of the so(5) representations of the elds
appearing in the l.h.s. of (3.23) into uh (1) representations, according to the general
formulae (3.17)(3.19)

the internal so(5) representations we need to branch are:

[0, 0]
[1, 0]
[1, 1]
[2, 0]

[1/2, 1/2]
[3/2, 1/2]

a, a, b

for the elds h, ha
for the elds ha, aa, aa, aabcd
for the elds aab, aab, aabc
for the elds h(ab)
for the elds , 

for the elds 
a

(1)
(5)
(10)
(14)
(4)
(16)

where on the extreme r.h.s. we have written the corresponding dimensions.

the explicit example worked out in (3.21), (3.22) do already give the branching for

the irrepses 5 and 4, namely

5  1  1  1  1  0 [1, 2] = [1, 0],
4  1  1  0  0

[1, 2] = [1/2, 1/2].

(3.65)

where we have named the uh (1) irrepses by their charge.

from (3.65) we easily nd the analogous breaking law for antisymmetric tensors
([1, 2] = [1, 1]), symmetric traceless tensors ([1, 2] = [2, 0]) and spin tensors ([1, 2] =
[3/2, 1/2]) by taking suitable combinations:

10  1  1  2  0  0  0  0
[1, 2] = [1, 1],
16  2  2  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0 [1, 2] =h 3
2i ,
2, 1
14  2  2  2  1  1  0  0  0  0
[1, 2] = [2, 0].
as it has been stressed in the sentence after (3.25), we know that the only irrepses
{} of su(2) su(2) which appear in the harmonic expansion of a eld belonging to the
so(d) irrep [], are those which, when branched with respect to uh(1), contain at least
one of the fragments of the branching (3.65) or (3.66).

(3.66)

19

to select such representations, we recall that a generic g tableaux can be written as

(3.12)

q + r  m2  m1,
q  r  n2  n1.

we observe that as long as m2  m1 and n2  n1 are even or odd, the same is true for
m1 + m2 and n1 + n2. therefore the parity of 2j and 2l is the same as that of 2j3 and
2l3 and since 2j3 + 2l3 = 2q can be even or odd, the same is true for 2j + 2l. thus j and
l must either be both integers or both halfintegers. this means that the q value of any
uh(1) fragment of the so(5) elds is always contained in any so(5)harmonic in the
irrep (j, l) provided that j and l are both integers or halfintegers. since q + r and q  r
are related to the third component of the angular momentum of the two su(2) factors,
one also has the conditions |q + r|  2j and |q  r|  2l. the two above conditions select
the harmonics appearing in the expansion.

4 computing the spectrum

 the scalar harmonic

the spectrum of the scalar harmonics y (j,l)

[0,0] = y (j,l,r)

q=0

is easily computed, since the

relevant vedimensional invariant operator is simply the covariant laplacian (3.2a):

2 = dada  didi + dsds + d5d5.

using (3.41)

2y (j,l,r)

q=0 = (a2(titi + tsts)  c2t5t5)y (j,l,r)

where a and a are ordinary pauli matrices. using the relations

3 2 =  2

(the same is true for ) and observing that on a young tableaux the s act like a derivative

(11 + 22)

an analogous result holds when acting with 11 + 22 on the second tableaux of (3.12),
with j  l.

the eigenvalue of (3  3)2 on (3.12) is

for a scalar, q = 0 and so, from (3.15), we have

(m2  m1 + n2  n1)2 = 4(j3 + l3)2.

j3 = l3 = r/2,

and we nd

2y (j,l,r)

(0) = "a2j(j + 1) + b2l(l + 1) + (4c2  a2  b2)

substituting the values of a,b and c given in (2.23), we obtain

2y (j,l,r)

(0) = h0(j, l, r)y (j,l,r)

is the eigenvalue of the laplacian. the same result was rst given in [4] using dierential
methods and it was also obtained in [5].

as shown in table (3.3), the scalar harmonic appears in the expansion of the ten
dimensional elds h(x, y), b(x, y), ha
a(x, y), aabcd(x, y) and a. the masses of the
corresponding vedimensional spacetime elds are thus given in terms of h0(j, l, r),
and explicitly they read

m2(h) = h0,
m2(b) = h0,

m2(, b) = h0 + 16  8qh0 + 4,
m2(a) = 8 + h0  4qh0 + 4 .

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

note that while the laplacian acts diagonally on the ads5 elds h(x) and b(x),
the eigenvalues for (x) and b(x), which appear entangled in the linearised equations of
motion [25], [29], have been obtained after diagonalisation of a two by two matrix.

when substituting the values of c and a in the matrix (4.17) we note that (2.23) denes
them only up to a sign. however, only one of them is consistent with supersymmetry.

exist, it must have the form

since, being an su(2)  su(2) singlet, it must satisfy th  = 0 (see (3.22)). at this
point the killing equation d/  = 5

su(2)  su(2) singlet the ta generators have a null action and thus, using (4.18),

recalling the meaning of c as the rescaling of the vielbein v 5, we conclude that t 11 ad-
mits a killing spinor, leading to n = 2 supersymmetry on ads5, only for one orientation
of t 11.

in order to compute the mass eigenvalues, we write (4.17) as an explicit 4  4 matrix

(4.31)

as can be easily seen from (3.21) to decompose a vector index under uh(1), it is

convenient to go to a complex basis, dening () = 1  i2 and ( ) = 3  i4.

note that, in principle, the ve entries of (4.32) are not independent because of the
transversality condition daya = 0. however,
it turns out to be more convenient to
treat the ve harmonics as independent, which amounts to say that we now consider
also longitudinal harmonics of the form day . the presence of a longitudinal harmonic
means that among the ve eigenvalues of the matrix, we should nd the eigenvalue of
the laplacian on the scalar harmonic, since the laplacebeltrami on a longitudinal p
form harmonic has the same eigenvalues of the laplacebeltrami operator acting on the
(p  1)form harmonic. in our case, we should then nd the eigenvalue of the laplacian
h0 between the ve we get. this indeed is the case and the remaining four eigenvalues
for the (transverse) 1forms are

[1,0] = {3 + h0(j, l, r  2), h0 + 4  2qh0 + 4}.

the mass spectrum of the sixteen vectors is thus





(4.32)

m2(b, ) = 
h0 + 12  6h0 + 4
h0 + 4  2h0 + 4


,

24

actually, as the laplacebeltrami operator acts diagonally on the complex vector eld
a(x), so we get eight mass values . conversely, the vectors b(x), (x) get mixed in the

linearised equations of motion [29], and upon diagonalisation we nd two extra masses for
each eigenvalue. as for the scalar elds, we will use the same names b and  also for
the eigenstates corresponding to linear combinations with plus or minus sign respectively
in the mass formulae (4.35) .

 the twoform harmonic

the relevant laplacebeltrami operator is now of the rstorder (3.3) and can be simply
expressed as

abcdetcyde + abcde(mc)d

for the purpose of the computation it is useful to think the action of the generators
in the representation space of a vector yab labeled by a couple of antisymmetric indices.
again, it is simpler to use a complex basis, where the various components of the tensor

have a denite uh(1) charge. ordering the ten components of yab as follows

comparing (4.38) with (4.37), one reconstructs the operator matrix

  and then
one computes the numerical matrix m . from this latter, we get four 0 eigenvalues

25

corresponding to the longitudinal harmonics8 and six eigenvalues corresponding to the
transverse ones

[1,1] =(cid:26)i(cid:18)1 qh0(j, l, r  2) + 4(cid:19) ,iqh0 + 4(cid:27) .

.

also in this case part of the spectrum we have shown has been computed in [5] and it

agrees with our results.

 the other harmonics

we have not calculated either the eigenvalues of d/ corresponding to the vectorspinor har-
monic a which produce ads5 spinors (t ), or the eigenvalues of the symmetric traceless
harmonic y ()
(ab). however, we know a priori how many states we obtain in these two cases,
and by a counting argument we can circumvent the problem of the explicit computation
of the eigenvalues of their mass matrices. for the vectorspinors we have in principle a
matrix of rank 20, that becomes 16  16 due to the irreducibility condition, and further
gets to 12 12, once the transversality condition daa = 0 is imposed. in this way we are
left with 12 nontrivial (non longitudinal) eigenvalues and thus we expect 12 (t ) spinors.
in an analogous way, the traceless symmetric tensor y ()
(ab) gives a 14 14 massmatrix out
of which ve eigenvalues are longitudinal leaving 9 nontrivial eigenvalues .

if we match the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom including the 12 + 12 (right)
lefthanded spinors (t ) and the 9 real elds  of the traceless symmetric tensor we nd
128 bosonic degrees of freedom and 128 fermionic ones. therefore, once we have correctly
and unambiguously assigned all the elds except the (t ) and  to supermultiplets of
su(2, 2|1), the remaining degrees of freedom of (t ) and  are uniquely assigned to the
supermultiplets for their completion.

5 filling of su (2, 2|1) multiplets

this section aims at combining the results of the harmonic expansion on t 11 with those
of the purely group theoretical analysis of the su(2, 2|1) representations, and proceed
by lling su(2, 2|1) supermultiplets with the appropriate eigenvalues of the kk mass

i.e.

operators. this procedure was originally devised [31] in the analysis of the spectra of
n = 2 supersymmetric ads4 compactications of eleven dimensional supergravity , where
the full symmetry group is osp(4|2), and has recently been revisited in [11], leading to
the uncovery of an interesting structure of new short multiplets. in the ads4 case, the
reconstruction of the supermultiplets was advantaged by the results of [23] where universal
mass relations among elds bound to each other by supersymmetry transformations were
derived from the general properties of harmonic expansion on coset manifolds with killing
spinors [24]. for ads5 compactications this tool is not available, but, as we will see,
one can still fully assemble all the kk elds into multiplets and retrieve elsewhere all the
necessary information.

on the group theory side, we need the unitary highest weight representations of
su(2, 2|1), originally worked out in [32],
[33] and recently nicely popularized in an
appendix of [34]. they are characterized in terms of the quantum numbers of the
u(1)  su(2)  su(2)  su(2, 2)  su(2, 2|1) bosonic subalgebra (e0, s1, s2), where
e0 is the ads energy, and by the internal symmetry su(2) su(2) u(1) labels (j, l, r),
r being the r-symmetry charge.

the general relations between e0 and the masses for elds of various spin are

= 2 + |m(3/2) + 3/2|

0

spin 2: e(2)
spin 3/2: e(3/2)
spin 1: e(1)

spin 0: e(0)

0 = 2 +q4 + m2
0 = 2 +q1 + m2
0 = 2 + |m(2f )|
= 2  |m(1/2)|
0 = 2 q4 + m2

(5.1)

the sign ambiguity in the spin zero and 1/2 formulae occurs because in these specic
cases the unitarity bound e0  1 + s allows the possibility e0 < 2.

we will arrange our results in a serie of nine tables , summarizing the properties of
the various families of unitary irreducible su(2, 2|1) representations d(e0, s1, s2; r), each
generated by a specic (s1, s2) state, having e(s)
0 = e0 and rcharge r. all descendant
states have an e(s)
0 value shifted in a range of 2 (in 1/2 steps) with respect to the e0 of the
multiplet, while their rsymmetry is shifted in a range of 2 in integer steps. the highest
spin state has unshifted rcharge r. we have one graviton multiplet d(e0, 1
2 ; r)(table
2), two left d(e0, 1
2; r) gravitino multiplets (tables 3-6) and
four vector multiplets d(e0, 0, 0; r) (tables 7-10). thus their structure and the information
in the columns labeled (s1, s2), e(s)
0 and r-symm. is purely group theoretical and implied
by the analysis of [32, 33, 34].

for generic values of the su(2)  su(2) quantum numbers j, l and the rsymmetry
r, the multiplets of the tables 210 are massive long multiplets of su(2, 2|1). however,
it is well known [34] that multiplet shortening occurs for specic values of the su(2, 2|1)

27

quantum numbers, when s1s2 = 0 or unitarity bounds are saturated. for su(2, 2|1),
there are three types of shortened representations:

e0 = 2 + s1 + s2,

these shortened representations are the most interesting ones in light of the correspon-
dence with the cft at the boundary, and their eld theoretical counterparts have been
extensively discussed in [1]. shortening has been related to peculiar e0 values reported
in (5.2)(5.4). the generic conditions to fulll the requirements that leads to multiplet
shortenings are thus

j = l =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
j = l  1 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

r  2

h0 + 4 =(cid:18) 3

r  2(cid:19)2

which gives rise to unitary shortenings only in one case [1].

we have thus added some symbols in the columns at the left of the tables to denote
the surviving states in the shortened multiplets: chiral (), semilong () or massless ()
multiplets.

in particular, the absence of these symbols in table 4 means that no shortening of any

kind can occur for the gravitino multiplet ii.

as explained above, the columns regarding the (s1, s2), e0, r-symmetry values and the
surviving states under shortening are determined by purely group theoretical arguments.
our goal is therefore to ll in the remaining two right columns of all tables with the value
of the masses (mass squared for all the elds related to second order operators), tting
unambiguously every kk eld of the spectrum at the right place.

28

the method used to complete the multiplets is by exhaustion [11, 31]: it consists in
starting from the highest spin 2 states, whose masses are unambiguously dened by the
eigenvalue [0,0] = h0 and determining their energy label making use of (5.1). once the
e0 of the multiplet (that in the graviton case belongs to one of the vector elds having
rcharge r) is identied, one uses the inverses of (5.1) and predicts the masses of all
the remaining states, and identies them among the kk mass eigenvalues. at the end
of this process, after the whole graviton multiplet has been lled, part of the gravitino
eigenvalues will still be unused. as they dont match any graviton, they must generate
their own spin 3
2 multiplets, and one repeats the above procedure of arranging the lower
spin states. again, the leftover vectors eigenmodes will start vector multiplets and the
lling process is reiterated until all the mass values have been used.

note that in the graviton multiplet and the rst two families of vector multiplets all

masses are written in terms of the usual h0

h0(j, l, r) = 6(cid:18)j(j + 1) + l(l + 1) 

1
8

r2(cid:19) ,

(5.8)

where r is the r charge of the fundamental state in the multiplet, while for the gravitino
multiplets there appear the shifted quantities

and similar expressions

h0  h0(j, l, r  1) = h0

(1  2r)

(5.10)

are used for the last two families of vector multiplets. this shifts are necessary in order
to match the expected masses with formulae (4.12)(4.30), obtained from the eigenvalues
[i,j], where one happens to nd h0 with shifted r.

it is useful to list also the inverse of the formulae (5.1), that give directly the masses or
mass squared of the various (s1, s2) representations, each having (2s1 + 1)(2s2 + 1) degrees
of freedom:

for the sake of clarity, we give an example by explaining in detail the assembling of

the graviton multiplet.

the rst line in table 2 is lled without eort, since (4.12) tells that the graviton mass
spectrum is given unambiguously by the scalar harmonic eigenvalue m2(h)  h0(j, l, r),
where r coincides with the rcharge of the basic vector state for the multiplet, having

(5.11)

now we pass to the left and right gravitini, having generically mass spectrum given by
(4.30)

e0 = 1 +qh0 + 4.

(5.12)

energy label e(1)
for the whole multiplet is

0 = e0. since e(2)

0 = e0 + 1, we can derive by (5.1) that the energy label

.

(5.13)

the predicted masses for each of the four spin 3/2 states are computed by inserting the
appropriate energy, given in terms of (5.12), and r-charges in formulae (5.11). due to the
presence of absolute values (and below, for spinors and scalars also of double sign choices),
the set found in this way is redundant. among the eight choices of eigenmodes (5.13) ,
only the four upper ones have a match within the predicted set of the graviton multiplet,
while the remaining lower ones will be highest spin states for gravitino multiplets.

the same procedure is applied to identify the four vector states, by matching formulae
(5.11) with the available spin one elds and eigenvalues within the choices (4.34)(4.35),
according to the dierent energy and r-charges. we point out that while the a eld is
selected without ambiguity, we have chosen to assign the b eld with the positive signs
in (4.35) and  the negative ones. the remaining eigenvalues will either t in gravitino
multiplets or give rise to vector multiplets on their own.

analogously, the 2form elds, spinors and the scalars are placed giving rise to the
generic massive long graviton multiplet, existing for arbitrary quantum numbers (j, l, r)
and having an irrational value of e0.

then we consider the various group-theoretical shortening patterns. if condition (5.5)
is imposed, some of the states drop out of the graviton multiplet that reduces to the
semilong multiplet identied with the  symbols.

the massless graviton multiplet identied by the  is obtained by further setting

j = l = r = 0, leading to h0 = 0 and e0 = 3.

the application of the above method yields the completion of all other tables, whose
shortening patterns have been treated to great depth in [1], to which we refer for any
detail.

6 the betti 3form

in this last section we want to add some considerations on the existence of the betti vector
multiplet in the kk spectrum previously discussed. it is obvious that betti multiplets
always exist when we expand in harmonics a (p + 1)form on the higherdimensional
space considered as a vector on adsdd and a pform on the internal compact space xd
provided xd contains nontrivial homology pcycles (or (d  p)cycles by poincare du-
ality). indeed, the rst appearance was discussed in kk ads4  s7 compactication [23],

30

while the corresponding physical meaning was rst discussed in [35] where the betti vector
multiplets have been interpreted as topological modes corresponding to the wrapping of
pbranes around the internal pcycles.

the interesting fact emerging from the analysis we presented is that in the ads5 case
we have not only the single betti vector multiplet but also a betti tensor and a betti
hypermultiplet deriving from the aab and aab elds, which are expanded in terms of
the 2form harmonic y[ab] containing the 2form dual to the betti form.

in this section we determine the explicit form of the betti 3form on t 11 using the

theorems proven in [23, 30]. they are

1. the betti pform is valued in the holonomy algebra of the internal space xd;

2. the betti pform is in the singlet representation of the isometry group g.

let us rst determine the holonomy algebra on t 11.

6.1 the holonomy algebra

we have already shown with the harmonic analysis the existence of two killing spinors
for the t 11 space, implying n = 2 supersymmetry in the bulk. we want now to rene
this result by explicitly deriving the holonomy algebra h.

a killing spinor is a zero mode of all the holonomy algebra generators

th = 0

(6.1)

and therefore the number of preserved supersymmetries is equal to the number of inde-
pendent solutions of the above equation.

the holonomy algebra must be a subalgebra of the tangent space one h  so(5) and
in order to have n = 2 supersymmetry h must be equal to su(2) [26], corresponding to
the canonical embedding so(3)  so(5):

5  3 + 1 + 1.

(6.2)

let us derive this result by explicitly building the th generators annihilating the
killing spinors. the th generators can be constructed by the analysis of the integrability
condition of the killing spinor equation

da =

e
2

a.

this equation admits solutions if and only if it is integrable, i.e.

[da,db] =

1
4

rab

cdcd =

e2
4

ab

which can be recast in the simpler expression

(rab,cdcd  ab) = 0.

31

(6.3)

(6.4)

(6.5)

it is now straightforward to implement this equation by inserting the riemann cur-
vature denitions (2.20). decomposing the antisymmetric couple ab according to a, b =
i, s, 5, we nd

ij :

st :

i5 :

s5 :

is :

(312 + 234  12) = 0,
(334 + 212  34) = 0,
0 = 0,

0 = 0,
(24  13) = 0,
(23 + 14) = 0.

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

(6.9)

(6.10)

the three independent elements of th (xing the normalisation in a convenient way) are
thus given by

g1 = 
g2 = 
g3 = 

1
2
1
2
1
2

(12 + 34),

(24  13),
(23 + 14),

(6.11)

(6.12)

(6.13)

and using the gamma matrix algebra, one easily concludes that the gi close the su(2)
algebra

[gi, gj] = ijkgk.

(6.14)

recalling that the killing spinors (4.18) derived previously from group theoretical

arguments are singlet under the holonomy algebra, setting

h = abcabc,

(6.15)

then h annihilates all the killing spinors: h = 0.

6.2 the betti 3form

it is known [30] that a harmonic 3form  on the t 11 manifold must be in the singlet
representation of the isometry group. this implies that its quantum numbers are j = l =
r = 0.

using the duality relation on the forms, the element (6.15) becomes

h = ab ab.

(6.16)

recalling the analysis of the uh(1) decomposition of the 2form given in sect. 4 (4.37) and
taking into account that h must be a singlet of the full isometry group su(2)  su(2) 
ur(1), the only components of ab diering from zero are + and  +  (in complex

32

notation) or 12 and 34 (in real notation) and that they must take real constant values
(since they contain only the singlet harmonic y 0

(0) in their expansion).

if we set

+ = a,

 +  = b,

a, b  r,

then the condition for h to be valued in the holonomy algebra h reads

h = a12 + b34 = g1 + g2 + g3

(6.17)

(6.18)

whose solution is  = a = b and  =  = 0 implying that h = a g1. thus, xing a = 1 for
convenience, the betti form is simply

 = hv 1v 2 + v 3v 4i .

appendix a: notations and conventions

consider ads5  t 11. we call m, n the curved tendimensional indices, , /m, n the
curved/at ads5 ones and /a, b the curved/at t 11 ones.

our tendimensional metric is the mostly minus  = {+ . . .}, so that the internal
space has a negative denite metric. for ease of construction, we have also used a negative
metric to raise and lower the su(2)  su(2) liealgebra indices.
furthermore, for the su(2) algebras we dened 123 = 12 = 1.
the so(5) gamma matrices are

appendix b:

as in section 3.6, given a representation {} of g, we call the index spanning the repre-
sentation space m (m = 1, . . . , dim{}), while we denote by hi an index ranging in the
subset spanned by the fragment {i} (hi = 1, . . . , dim{i}).

let us start from the leftinvariant oneform on g/h decomposed along the th h

and ta k generators according to the lie algebra decomposition g = h + k:

where v a are the vielbeins of g/h and h is the socalled hconnection. we have

l1dl = hth + v ata

(b.1)

we have by denition of harmonic (l1)m

. from (b.2) we get

dl1 = v a(tal1 + h

a th l1)

(tal1)m

hi = (ta)n

hi(l1)m

(ta)hi

hj y {}m

hj

hi

hi  y {}m
xj=1

n =

m

(b.2)

(b.3)

(b.5)

(b.6)

(b.7)

(thl1)m

(b.4)
where in the latter we have used the fact that, being {i} irreducible, only the entries in
the ith block (th)ki

ki = (th)hi

hi are nonvanishing.

hi = (th)ki

hi(l1)m

ki

kiy {}m

hence, (b.2) becomes (omitting the index {} denoting the grepresentation)

dy m

hi = v a


(ta)hi

n

xj=1

hj y m

hi + h

a (th )hi

kiy m

hi


or, introducing the hcovariant derivative

dh  d(h)

we have

dhy m

hi = r(a)v a

(ta)hi

hj y m
hi ,

n

xj=1

where we have taken into account the vielbein rescaling r(a) introduced in (2.12). this is
formula (3.31) of the text.

on the other hand, an so(d) harmonic (see equation (3.25)) has so(d) covariant

derivative given by

(b.8)
where again we have used the fact that tab is blockdiagonal under the branching so(d) 
h. decomposing bab into the hconnection plus more we have

hi + (bcd)(tcd)hi

hi = dy m

dy m

kiy m
ki .

bcdtcd = hth + m cdtcd

(b.9)

and substituting in (b.8) we obtain

hi = r(a)v a

dy m

(ta)hi

n

xj=1

hj y m

hj + m cd(tcd)hi

kiy m
ki

(b.10)

which gives rise to equation (3.32) of the text.
