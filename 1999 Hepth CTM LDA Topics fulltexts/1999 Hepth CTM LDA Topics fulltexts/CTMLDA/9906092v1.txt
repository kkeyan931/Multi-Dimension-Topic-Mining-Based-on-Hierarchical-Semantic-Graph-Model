semiclassical approximation for

chern-simons theory and 3-hyperbolic

invariants

a.a. bytsenko, l. vanzo, and s. zerbini

abstract. the invariant integration method for chern-simons
theory dened on the compact hyperbolic manifold \h3 is veried
in the semiclassical approximation. the semiclassical limit for the
partition function is presented. we discuss briey l2 analytic
torsion and the eta invariant of atiyah-patodi-singer for compact
hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

1. introduction

it is known that topological invariants associated with 3-manifolds
can be constructed within the framework of chern-simons gauge theory
[1]. these values have been specied in terms of the axioms of topo-
logical quantum eld theory in [2], whereas the equivalent derivation
of invariants has also been presented combinatorially in [3, 4], where
modular hopf algebras related to quantum groups have been used. the
wittens (topological) invariants have been explicitly calculated for a
number of 3-manifolds and gauge groups [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. the
semiclassical approximation for the chern-simons partition function
may be expressed by the asymptotics for k   of wittens invariant
of a 3-manifold m and a gauge group g. typically this expression is a
partition function of quadratic functional. this asymptotics leads to a
series of c  invariants associated with triplets {m; f ; } with m a
smooth homology 3 sphere, f a homology class of framings of m, and
 an acyclic conjugacy class of ortogonal representations of the funda-
mental group 1(m) [12]. in addition the cohomology h(m; ad ) of
m with respect to the local system related to ad  vanishes.

this note is an extension of the two previous papers [13, 14]. here
our aim is to use again the invariant integration method [15, 16] in its
simplest form in order to evaluate the semiclassical approximation in
the chern-simons theory. we do this analysing the partition function
related to compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds \h3, where h3 is the real
hyperbolic space and  is a co-compact discrete group of isometries
(for details see ref. [17]).

we conclude this section introducing the wittens invariant dened
by the partition function associated with a chern-simons gauge theory

w(k) =z daeikcs(a),

k  z.

(1.1)

the formal integration in (1.1) is one over the gauge elds a in a trivial
bundle, i.e. 1-forms on the 3-dimensional manifold x with values in
lie algebra g of a gauge group g. the chern-simons functional cs(a)
can be considered as a function on a space of connections on a trivial
principal bundle over a compact oriented 3-manifold x given by

cs(a) =

1

4zx

tr(cid:18)a  da +

2
3

a  a  a(cid:19) .

(1.2)

let x be a locally symmetric riemannian manifold with negative sec-

metric space of rank one. the group of orientation preserving isome-

tional curvature. its universal covering fx  x is a riemannian sym-
tries eg of fx is a connected semisimple lie group of real rank one and
fx = eg/fk, where fk is a maximal compact subgroup of eg. the fun-
damental group of x acts by covering transformations on fx and gives
rise to a discrete, co-compact subgroup   eg such that x = \eg/fk.
let g be a linear connected nite covering of eg, the embedding   eg
lifts to an embedding   g. let k  g be a maximal compact sub-
group of g, then x = \g/k is a compact manifold. let g = k  p
be a cartan decomposition of the lie algebra g of g. let a  p be
a one-dimensional subspace and j = kt ga be the centralizer of a in
k. fixing a positive root system of (g, a) we have the iwasawa decom-
position g = k  a  n. for g = so(n, 1) (n  z+), k = so(n), and
j = so(n  1). the corresponding symmetric space of non-compact
type is the real hyperbolic space hn of sectional curvature 1.
its
compact dual space is the unit n sphere.
since cs(a) does not contain any metric on x, the quantity w(k)
is expected to be metric independent, namely to be a (well-dened)
topological invariant of x. indeed, this fact has been proved in refs.
[3, 4]. in the limit k  , the asymptotics of the wittens invariant

(semiclassical approximation of eq. (1.1)), involves only a partition
functions of quadratic functionals [1], namely

exp (ikcs(af ))z d exp  ik

4zx

tr(  daf )! .

x[af ]

(1.3)

in above equation the sum is taken over representatives af for each
point [af ] in the moduli-space of at gauge elds on x. in addition
the  are lie-algebra-valued 1-forms and daf is the covariant derivative
determined by af ,

daf  = d + [af , ].

(1.4)

2. quadratic functional with elliptic resolvent

let m be a compact oriented riemannian manifold without bound-
ary, and n = 2m + 1 = dimm is the dimension of the manifold. let
 : 1(m) 7 o(v,h ,iv ) be a representation of 1(m) on real vec-
torspace v . the mapping  determines (on a basis of standard con-
struction in dierential geometry) a real at vectorbundle  over m
and a at connection map p on the space p(m, ) of dierential p
forms on m with values in . one can say that  determines the space
of smooth sections in the vectorbundle p(t m)  . one can con-
struct from the metric on m and hermitian structure in  a hermitian
structure in (t m)   and the inner products h ,im in the space
m(m, ). thus

so = h,oim,

(2.1)
where () is the hodge-star map. the map o is formally self-adjoint
with the property o2 = 
mm. suppose that the quadratic functional
(2.1) is dened on the space g = g(m, ) of smooth sections in a real
hermitian vectorbundle  over m. there exists a canonical topological
elliptic resolvent r(so), related to the functional (2.1), namely

o = m,

m2 m1(m, )

m1 ker(so)

0 0 0(m, ) 0 ...

(2.2)
therefore, for the resolvent r(so), we have gp = mp(m, ) and
h p(r(so)) = h mp(), where h p() = ker(p)/(p1) are the co-
homology space. note that so  0 and therefore ker(so)  ker(o) =
ker(m).
let us choose an inner product h ,ih p in each space h p(r(so)).
the partition function of so with the resolvent (2.2) can be written in
the form (see refs. [18, 16])

0 0.

a.a. bytsenko, l. vanzo, and s. zerbini

w(k)  w(k; r(so),h ,ih,h ,i) =(cid:18)
 (m, ,h ,ih)1/2,

k(cid:19)(0,|o|)/2

(2.3)
where |o| = 
o2 is dened via spectral theory. this is the basic for-
mula one has to evaluate. with regard to the quantity  (m, ,h ,ih),
it is related the ray-singer torsion. in fact, if h 0() 6= 0 and h p() =
0 for p = 1, ..., m, then the product

e i

4 (0,o)

 (m, ,h ,ih) = t (2)

an (m)  vol(m)dimh 0(),

(2.4)
is metric independent [19], i.e. the metric dependence of the ray-singer
torsion t (2)

an (m) factors out as v (m)dimh 0().

as far as the zeta-function (0,|o| is concerned, we recall that there
exists ,  > 0 such that for 0 < t <  the heat kernel expansion for
self-adjoint laplace operators lp is given by

tr(cid:16)etlp(cid:17) = x00

starting with the formula [18]

a(lp)tl + o(t).

(2.5)

(0, lp) = a0(lp)  dim(ker(lp)) = a0(lp)  dimh p(r(s)),

(2.6)
one can shown that the zeta function (s,|o|) is well-dened and ana-
lytic for (s) > 0 and can be continued to a meromorphic function on
c, regular at s = 0 and

(0,|o|) =xp=0

(1)p(a0(lp)  dimh p(r(s))).

(2.7)

furthermore, the zeta function (0,|o|) appearing in the partition
function (2.3) can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the coho-
mology spaces of o. indeed, if the dimension of m is odd (n = 2m + 1)
then for all p a0(lp) = 0, because we are dealing with manifold without
boundary. since h p(r(so)) = h mp() (the poincar`e duality) for the
resolvent (2.2), it follows that

(0||o|) = 

mxp=0
(1)pdimh p(r(s)) = (1)m+1

mxp=0
(1)pdimh p().
(2.8)
finally, the dependence of the eta invariant (0|o) of atiyah-patodi-
singer on the connection map o can be expressed with the help of the
formula for the index of the twisted signature operator for a certain

semiclassical approximation for chern-simons theory

vectorbundle over m  [0, 1] (see [20, 21, 22]). furthermore it can be
shown [18] that

(s|b) = 2(s|o),

(2.9)

(2.10)

where the b are elliptic self-adjoint maps on (m, ) dened on p-forms
by

bp = (i)(p)(cid:16) + (1)p+1(cid:17) ,

in this formula (p) = (p+1)(p+2)+m+1 and for the hodge star-map
we have used    = h, ivol. from the hodge theory we have

dimkerb =

dimh p().

(2.11)

mxp=0

3. the case of real compact hyperbolic manifolds

in this section, we shall consider the specic case of a compact hy-
perbolic 3-manifolds of the form m = x = \h3. if the at bundle,
 is acyclic, then for l2 torsion one gets [23]: [t (2)
an (x)]2 = r(0),
where r(s) is the ruelle function. the function r(s) is an alternat-
ing product of more complicate factors, each of which is a selberg zeta
function zp(s; ). the relation of ruelle and selberg functions is:

r(s) =

zp(p + s; )(1)j

.

(3.1)

dimm 1yp=0

the function r(s) extends meromorphically to the entire complex
plane c [24]. the ruelle function associated with closed oriented hy-
perbolic 3-manifold x = \h3 has the form r(s) = z0(s; )z2(2 +
s; )/z1(1 + s; ). the analytic torsion for manifold x has been cal-
culated (in the presence of non-vanishing betti numbers bi  bi(x) =
rankzhi(x; z)) in refs. [13, 14].
now we consider the evaluation of eta invariant contribution. with
regard to this point, a remarkable formula relating (s,o) to the closed
geodesics on x has been obtained by millson [25]. more explicitly,
millson has proved the following result for a selberg type (shintani)

let us dene a zeta function by the following series, which is abso-

zeta function ez(s,o).
lutely convergent for (s) > 0,

where [] runs over the nontrivial conjugacy classes in  = 1(x),
() is the length of the closed geodesic c (with multiplicity m()) in
the free homotopy class corresponding to [], ph() is the restriction of
the linear poincare map p () = d1 at (c, c)  t x to the directions
normal to the geodesic ow t and  
 is the parallel translation around
c on 
 = i eigenspace of b( c) (b denoting the principal symbol
of o). then ez(z,o) admits a meromorphic continuation to the entire

complex plane, which in particular is holomorphic at s = 0 and

logez(0,o) = i(0,o).

furthermore, it is possible to show that ez(s,o) satises the functional

equation

(3.4)
now we have all the ingredients for the evaluation of the partition
function (2.3) in terms of l2 analytic torsion and a selberg type
function. the nal result is

ez(s,o)ez(s,o) = e2i(0,o).

4. concluding remarks

for a real compact hyperbolic 3-manifold, the formula (3.5) gives
the value of the asymptotics of the chern-simons-witten invariant.
this is the main result of our paper. the invariant (3.5) involves the
l2 analytic torsion, which can be expressed by means of selberg
zeta functions and a shintani zeta function ez(0,o) associated with
the eta invariant of atiyah-patodi-singer [20]. finally we note that
the explicit result (3.5) can be very important for investigating the
relation between quantum invariants for an oriented 3-manifold, dened
with the help of a representation theory of quantum groups [3, 4], and
wittens invariant [1], which is, instead, related to the path integral
approach.
