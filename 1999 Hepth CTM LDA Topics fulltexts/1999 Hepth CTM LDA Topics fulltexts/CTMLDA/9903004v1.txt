the gauge dependence of the eective potential is controlled by a set of dierential equations called nielsen identi-
ties [1], which are satised whether the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken or not. in the case of spontaneously
broken gauge theories, one of the physical appeals of the nielsen identities is that it guarantees that the spontaneous
symmetry breaking is realized by an actual physical minimum, in spite of the eective potential be gauge dependent.
physical observables gauge independence has been studied by using the idea of extended brs symmetry [24],
this is achieved by enlarging the brs symmetry allowing the transformation of the gauge parameters into new (brs
invariant) grassmann variables.

the main purpose of this letter is to present some comments with respect to the nielsen identities in a context of
renormalizable theories quantized in general linear covariant gauges using the extended brs technique. all subtleties
of the method used here, as well as some controversies presented in the literature related to the validity of the nielsen
identities, are discussed quite detailed in [5].

let us consider a general compact lie group, g = s  a, with s and a being the semi-simple and abelian factors,
respectively. the matter content is described by a set of scalar and spinor elds, i(x) (i = 1, . . . , n), and i (x)
(i = 1, . . . , n), respectively. the matter elds carrying anti-hermitian irreducible representations of g transform as

i(x) = a(x)t ()j
i (x) = a(x)t ()j

ai
ai j (x) ,

(j(x) + vj) ,

while the transformation of gauge elds aa

(x) is

aa

(x) = a(x)  f a

bcb(x)ac

(x) ,

(1)

(2)

where a(x) are real c functions of the space-time point x and f a
bc are the real structure constants of g. the set of
indices a, b, c should be understood as a split into a semi-simple subset as, bs, cs = 1, . . . , ns and an abelian subset
aa, ba, ca = 1, . . . , na, corresponding to the semi-simple and abelian components of g.

owing to the local character of the transformations (1), covariant derivatives are required, they read

let us consider, a priori, a renormalizable theory [4] in d space-time dimensions, represented by the classical action

as we have previously mentioned, we shall restrict our analysis to a general covariant linear gauge, which should
be added to the classical action, inv, in order to make the quantization feasible. a general linear brs invariant (due
to the nilpotency of s) gauge-xing [6,7] can be written as

gf =z ddx ab(cid:26)ba[gb +
= sz ddx abca(cid:26)gb +

where ab is an arbitrary symmetric positive denite matrix, 0 is a gauge parameter and ga(x) is the gauge function
(linear in the quantum elds) depending on the gauge parameters  ,  = 1, . . . , n. the gauge function, ga(x), is
related to the faddeev-popov ghost operator, (mc)a(x), by a brs-doublet relation

sga = (mc)a , s(mc)a = 0 .

the gauge dependence of the classical theory, given by the action  = inv + gf , reads

 = sz ddx abca(cid:26)gb +

(8)

where is assumed that no sum1 runs on the gauge parameter index , i.e., eq.(8) is satised by each gauge parameter
 separately. notice that the right-hand side of eq.(8) being a brs-variation, therefore, expressing the unphysical
character of the gauge parameters, means that the physical quantities, functions of gauge invariant operators, are
independent of those gauge parameters [3,4].

at this point we shall introduce new grassmann variables, , dening them as the brs transformations of the

gauge parameters [24], , as follows

s =  , s = 0 .

(9)

bearing in mind the extended brs transformations, namely, the elds brs transformations (5) together with (9),
we require now invariance of the classical action, , under these transformations, which leads to a redenition of the
gauge-xing term (6):

gf = sz ddx abca(cid:26)gb +
=z ddx ab(cid:26)ba[gb +

such that

it should be stressed that, in view of the dependence of the gauge function ga(x) on the gauge parameters  ,
the requirement of invariance under the extended brs transformations demands a further redenition of the initial

sga = (fmc)a , s(fmc)a = 0 .

(12)

since some of the brs transformations are nonlinear, therefore, subjected to renormalization, an action depending
on the antields (external elds) coupled to those nonlinear brs transformations should be added to the gauge-xed
action, :

ext =z ddx (cid:8)a

where the antields, a

the total classical action, (0), which is the limit h  0 of the vertex functional ()2

reads

 = (0) + o(h) ,

(0) = inv + gf + ext

.

(13)

(14)

(15)

due to the fact that the vertex functional, , respects all symmetries of the classical action, (0), it does also with

respect to the extended slavnov-taylor identity

s() =z ddx (cid:26)

which expresses, in a functional way, the invariance of the quantum theory under the extended brs symmetry. it is

the both operators, s() and s, satisfy the following identities:

sf s(f ) = 0 , f ,

(sf )2 = 0 if s(f ) = 0 ,

(17)

(18)
(19)

in particular, since s() = 0, then a nilpotency relation holds for the linearized extended slavnov-taylor operator

now, by considering the slavnov-taylor identity (16), we get

(s)2 = 0 .

 


s() = 0 ,

from which the following identities stem

 +  
 

 = s(cid:18) 

(cid:19) ,

(20)

(21)

(22)

2as we have previously mentioned, it is supposed a priori a renormalizable theory, which means that the renormalized vertex
functional, , satises all symmetries of its tree-graph approximation, (0).

representing, therefore, identities that control the gauge dependence of the vertex functional . by setting now
 = 0, eq.(22) reads

where    is the quantum operator insertion dened by

 

 = s(  ) ,

.

(23)

(24)

     

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

as we shall see further on, the nielsen identities [1] are a particular case of eq.(23), in fact, this equation reveals the
unphysical character of the gauge parameters. the nielsen identities, which control the gauge (unphysical) dependence
of the eective potential, stems straight away from eq.(23) when we specialize the vertex functional to the eective
potential case. in view of the fact that the eective potential be obtained from the fourier transform of the vertex

functional at zero external momenta, e(0, . . . , 0), and by setting all elds to zero, except for the scalar elds which

are taken as constant congurations, so, no ir problem is desired at all. in fact, this can be achieved by guaranteeing
that the gauge-xing gives mass to all unphysical degrees of freedom, since the physical ones are assumed as massive
particles in the broken phase.

from the denition of the eective potential, ve (), which is the zeroth order term in the expansion of the vertex

functional, , by setting all elds to zero except for the scalar elds which are assumed as constants, i(x) = i,

we get

() = ve()z ddx ,

ve () 

xn=0 xi1,...,inei1in (0, . . . , 0) i1

   in ,

(25)

(26)

where ei1in (0, . . . , 0) are the momentum-space vertex functions taken at zero external momenta.

now, by taking into account the gauge control identity (23) together with the eective potential denition, eq.(25),

the following identity holds

 ve

 + ci(, )

ve
i

= 0 ,

.

(27)

(28)

where

ci(, ) = z ddx

(  )

i

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)i(x)=i

notice that eq.(27) is valid for each gauge parameter  ( = 0, . . . , n), it represents the well-known nielsen identi-
ties [1] for the eective potential.

as a nal conclusion, this algebraic proof, based on general theorems of renormalization, leads to unambiguous
proof of the validity of the nielsen identities, to all orders in perturbation theory, for renormalizable theories in any
dimensions quantized in the context of general linear covariant gauges, with the gauge group being a general compact
lie group. the controversies presented in the literature concerning the conditional validity of the nielsen identities
to a subspace of the gauge parameters space are discussed quite detailed in ref. [5], in fact, this letter is a natural
extension of that work.
