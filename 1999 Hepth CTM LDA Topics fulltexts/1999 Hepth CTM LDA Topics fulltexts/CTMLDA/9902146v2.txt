abstract

we discuss some aspects of cohomological properties of a two-dimensional free abelian
gauge theory in the framework of brst formalism. we derive the conserved and nilpotent
brst- and co-brst charges and express the hodge decomposition theorem in terms of
these charges and a conserved bosonic charge corresponding to the laplacian operator. it
is because of the topological nature of free u(1) gauge theory that the laplacian operator
goes to zero when equations of motion are exploited. we derive two sets of topological
invariants which are related to each-other by a certain kind of duality transformation and
express the lagrangian density of this theory as the sum of terms that are brst- and co-
brst invariants. mathematically, this theory captures together some of the key features
of witten- and schwarz type of topological eld theories.

1 introduction

one of the key theorems in the mathematical aspects of cohomology is the celebrated
hodge decomposition theorem dened on a compact manifold. this theorem states that
any arbitrary p-form fp on this manifold can be decomposed into a harmonic form p
(p = 0, dp = 0, p = 0), an exact form d gp1 and a co-exact form  hp+1:

fp = p + d gp1 +  hp+1

(1.1)

where (=   d ) is the hodge dual of d (with d2 = 0, 2 = 0) and laplacian  is dened
as  = (d + )2 = d + d [1-4]. so far, the analogue of d has been found out as the local,
conserved and nilpotent (q2
b = 0) becchi-rouet-stora-tyutin (brst) charge qb which
generates a nilpotent brst symmetry for a locally gauge invariant lagrangian density
in any arbitrary dimension of spacetime. the physical state condition qb |phys > = 0
leads to the annihilation of physical states in the quantum hilbert space by the rst-class
constraints of the original gauge theory. this requirement is essential for the consistent
quantization of a theory endowed with the rst-class constraints (see, e.g., [5-10]) . it will
be an interesting idea to explore the possibility of nding out the local conserved charges
corresponding to  and  so that a complete physical understanding of brst cohomology
and hodge decomposition can emerge in the quantum hilbert space of states.

the purpose of the present work is to provide some physical interpretations to the
analogues of  and  in the language of nilpotent (for ), local, covariant and continu-
ous symmetry properties of a free u(1) gauge theory described by the brst invariant
lagrangian densities and show that this theory is a tractable eld theoretical model for
the hodge theory in two (1 + 1) dimensions of spacetime. some very interesting and il-
luminating attempts [13-16] have been made towards this goal for the abelian as well as
non-abelian gauge theories in any arbitrary dimension of spacetime. however, the symme-
try transformations turn out to be nonlocal and noncovariant. in the relativistic covariant
formulation, the symmetry transformations turn out to be even non-nilpotent and they
become nilpotent only when some restrictions are imposed [17]. we shall demonstrate that
for the two dimensional brst invariant free u(1) gauge theory, a conserved and nilpotent
co(dual)-brst charge qd (i.e., the analogue of ) can be dened which corresponds to a
new local, covariant, continuous and nilpotent symmetry transformation under which the
gauge-xing term a = ( a)  remains invariant. this should be compared and contrasted
with the usual brst transformation under which the two-form f = da remains invariant
in the u(1) gauge theory. further, we show that the anticommutator of both these charges
w = {qb, qd} is the analogue of the laplacian operator  and it turns out to be the

 attempts have also been made to discuss the second-class constraints in the framework of brst

formalism (see, e.g., [11,12] and references therein).

 here one-form a = a dx denes the vector potential a of the u (1) gauge theory. furthermore, it
can be easily seen that the gauge-xing term (  a) =  a is the hodge dual of the two-form f = da in
the abelian u (1) gauge theory in any arbitrary dimension of spacetime (see, e.g., ref. [2]).

casimir operator for the extended brst algebra. we implement the hodge decomposition
theorem with these charges and show that the requirement of the annihilation of physical
(harmonic) states by qb and qd is sucient to gauge away both the degrees of freedom of
a single photon in 2d. the ensuing theory becomes topological in nature (as there are no
propagating degrees of freedom left in the theory) [18]. in the framework of brst coho-
mology and hodge decomposition theorem, this fact is encoded in rendering the casimir
operator w to go to zero (w  0) when equations of motion are exploited and all the
elds are assumed to fall o rapidly at x  . on the contrary, for the 2d interacting
u(1) gauge theory, it has been shown that w does not go to zero on the on-shell because
of the presence of matter degrees of freedom in the theory [19]. for the topological 2d free
u(1) gauge theory, we derive two sets of topological invariants with respect to both the
conserved and nilpotent charges qb and qd. these invariants turn out to be connected
with each-other by a certain specic type of duality transformation.

the outline of our paper is as follows. in sec. 2, we set up the notations and sketch
briey the essentials of brst formalism for u(1) gauge theory in any arbitrary dimension
of spacetime. sec. 3 is devoted to the derivation of the nilpotent and conserved (anti)dual
brst charge and the laplacian operator in two dimensions of spacetime. this is followed,
in sec. 4, by the discussion of an extended brst algebra which is constituted by six
conserved charges. we discuss hodge decomposition theorem and obtain two sets of topo-
logical invariants in sec. 5. finally, we make some concluding remarks in sec. 6.

2 preliminary: brst invariant lagrangians

we begin with the brst invariant lagrangian density (lb) for the u(1) gauge theory in
the feynman gauge (see, e.g., [5-9])

lb =  1

4 f f  1

2 (  a)2  i cc

(2.1)

where the rst term is the classical maxwell lagrangian density and second and third
terms are the gauge-xing and faddeev-popov ghost terms respectively. here the u(1)
gauge connection a is dened through the one-form a = a dx and the curvature term
f = a  a (,  = 0, 1, 2, ....d  1) is obtained from the two-form f = da in
any d-dimensional at minkowski spacetime. furthermore, the gauge-xing term (  a) =
a  a, is the hodge dual of the two-form f = da and c(c) are the anti (ghost)
elds. the following on-shell (c = 0) nilpotent (2

b = 0) symmetry transformations

ba = c,
b c = i(  a),

bc = 0,

bf = 0
b(  a) = c

lead to the derivation of a conserved and on-shell nilpotent brst charge qb

qb = z dd1x [ 0(  a)c  (  a)0c ]

(2.2)

(2.3)

where  is an anticommuting ( c = c ,  c =  c ) spacetime independent innites-
imal parameter. introduction of an auxiliary eld b in the lagrangian density (2.1)

4

lb =  1

4 f f + b(  a) + 1

2 b2  i c  c

enables the validity of an o-shell nilpotent (2

b = 0) symmetry transformations

ba =   c,
b c = i  b,

bf = 0,

bc = 0
b(  a) =   c

bb = 0,

which lead to the existence of an o-shell nilpotent and conserved brst charge

qb = z d(d1)x [b c  bc].

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

the invariance of the ghost action if.p. = ir ddx cc under discrete symmetry
transformations: c  i c, c  ic implies the existence of a conserved and nilpotent
anti-brst charge (qab) which can be derived from the expressions (2.3) and (2.6) by the
substitution c  i c. the continuous global symmetry invariance of the total action
under the transformations: c  ec, c  e c, a  a, b  b, (where  is a global
parameter), leads to the derivation of the conserved ghost charge (qg)

qg = iz d(d1)x [ c c + c c ].
together, these conserved charges obey the following algebra:

b = 1

2 {qb, qb} = 0, q2

q2
{qb, qab} = qb qab + qab qb = 0
i[qg, qb] = +qb,

i[qg, qab] = qab

ab = 1

2 {qab, qab} = 0

(2.7)

(2.8)

where the cononical (anti)commutators for the brst invariant lagrangians are exploited
for the derivation of the above algebra. this algebra is valid for u(1) gauge theory in any ar-
bitrary dimensions of spacetime. it will be noticed that the anticommutator {qb, qab} = 0
implies that the combined transformations bab + abb acting on any eld produce no
transformation at all. thus, anti-brst charge is not the analogue of the dual(adjoint)
exterior derivative () for the u(1) gauge theory .

3 dual-brst symmetry in two dimensions

in addition to the symmetries: c  i c, c  ic, the ghost action ir d2x  c  c
in 2d respects another symmetry; namely, 

   i   ,

 =  
 .

(3.1)

 it has been demonstrated in ref.

[20] that the anticommutator of the cohomologically higher order
brst- and anti-brst charges is not zero and it leads to the denition a cohomologically higher order
laplacian operator for the compact non-abelian lie algebras.

 we adopt here the notations in which the 2d at minkowski metric is :  = diag (+1, 1) and
 =   = 00 11, f = 0f, f01 = 0a1 1a0 = e = f 10, 01 = 10 = +1, ( a) = 0a0 1a1.

it turns out that the total 2d lagrangian density (2.1)

lb = 1

2 e2  1

2(  a)2  i cc

5

(3.2)

remains invariant under the combination of the above two transformations because the
ghost term remains invariant on its own and the kinetic energy term and gauge-xing term
exchange with each-other:

1

2 e2 = 1

2 (0a1  1a0)2   1

2(  a)2 = 1

2(0a0  1a1)2.

(3.3)

thus, in addition to the gauge brst symmetry (2.2), we have an on-shell ( c = 0)
nilpotent (2

d = 0) dual brst symmetry d for the lagrangian density (3.2)

da =    c,
de =  c,

d c = 0,

dc = ie
d(  a) = 0

(3.4)

which can be derived from (2.2) by the substitutions : c  +i c,   +i k. we
christen this symmetry as dual brst because, in contrast to b transformations where
the electric eld e is invariant, in the case of d, it is the gauge-xing term (  a) that
remains invariant . thus, we shall call the duality transformations for the lagrangian
density (3.2) as the ones where : c   i c, c   ic,    i . introducing an
auxiliary eld b, the analogue of the lagrangian density (2.4) can be written as

lb = b e  1

2 b2 + b (  a) + 1

2 b2  i cc

which respects the following o-shell nilpotent (2

d = 0) dual brst symmetry

da =  c,
de =  c,

d c = 0,

dc = ib,

d(  a) = 0,

db = 0
db = 0.

(3.5)

(3.6)

this o-shell nilpotent dual brst transformations can be obtained from the transfor-
mations (2.5) (with the inclusion of bb = 0) by the substitution : c  +i c,  
+i , b  ib, b  ib. it can be checked that the o-shell nilpotent brst and
dual brst transformations (2.5) and (3.6) are connected with each-other by

c  i c, e  i(  a), b  i b
c  ic,
(  a)  ie, b  i b

(3.7)

which is a manifestation of the fact that the lagrangian density (3.5) goes to itself under the
above substitutions. thus, for the lagrangian density (3.5), the duality transformations
are: c   i c, c   ic,    i , b   ib, b   ib . these continuous
k here and in what follows, we shall take only the (+) sign in the transformations: c  i c, c 

ic,   i . however, analogous statements will be valid if we take () sign.

 as per our denition in the introduction, the gauge-xing term a = (  a) with  = d is the

dual of the two-form f = da which is the electric eld e here in 2d.

note that we have taken the upper sign of these transformations in equation (3.7). however, the above

statements are valid for the lower sign as well.

6

symmetries (d,d) lead to the derivation of the following conserved and nilpotent (q2
dual brst charge due to noether theorem:

(d,d) = 0)

q(d,d) = z dx [e c  e c]  z dx [b c  b c]

(3.8)

which generates (3.4) and (3.6) (i.e., r = i[, qr], r = d, d and (+) stands for
(anti)commutator corresponding to (fermionic)bosonic ). due to discrete symmetry in-
variance of the ghost action under c  i c, c  ic, we have the existence of a conserved
and nilpotent anti-dual brst charge q(ad,ad) which can be derived from (3.8) by these
substitutions (i.e., c  i c).

it is obvious that qb and qd are the fermionic symmetry generators (q2

d = 0)
for the lagrangian density (3.5). thus, the anticommutator of the two ({qb, qd}) will
also be a symmetry generator. the corresponding bosonic transformation w = {b, d}
with the innitesimal bosonic transformation parameter  (= - i  )

b = 0, q2

w a = (b +  b),
w c = 0,

w c = 0,

w b = 0,
w (  a) = b,

w b = 0
w e = b

(3.9)

is the symmetry of the above lagrangian density (3.5) because w lb = ([ bb 
bb ]). here  and  are the innitesimal fermionic transformation parameters corre-
sponding to b and d respectively. the generator of the above symmetry transformation
(and the analogue of the laplacian operator) is a conserved charge (w ) given by:

w = z dx [ b b  b b ].

(3.10)

this conserved quantity can be directly calculated from the anticommutator {qb, qd} if we
exploit the canonical (anti)commutators : {c(x, t), c(y, t)} = (x  y), { c(x, t), c(y, t)} =
(x  y), [a0(x, t), b(y, t)] = i(x  y), [a1(x, t), b(y, t)] = i(x  y) and the rest of the
(anti)commutators are zero. here (x  y) is the dirac delta function.

4 extended brst algebra

the set of all the conserved charges are the (anti)brst, (anti)dual brst, ghost and the
w operator. together, these charges for the 2d free u(1) gauge theory are

qb = z dx h b c  b c i,
qd = z dx h b c  b c i,
w = z dx h b b  b b i,

qab = iz dx h b c  b c i
qad = iz dx h b c  b c i
qg = iz dx h c c + c c i.

(4.1)

if we exploit the covariant canonical (anti)commutators, these conserved charges obey the

following extended brst algebra

b = q2

d = q2

ab = q2

[w, qk] = 0, k = b, d, ab, ad, g
q2
ad = 0
{qb, qd} = {qab, qad} = w
i[qg, qb] = +qb,
i[qg, qd] = qd,

i[qg, qab] = qab
i[qg, qad] = +qad

7

(4.2)

and all the rest of the (anti)commutators turn out to be zero. a few remarks are in order.
first of all, we see that the operator w is the casimir operator for the whole algebra and
its ghost number is zero. the ghost number of qb and qad is +1 and that of qd and
qab is 1. now given a state | > in the quantum hilbert space with the ghost number
n (i.e., iqg| >= n| >), it is straightforward, due to the above commutation relations,
to check that the following relations are satised:

iqg qb| > = (n + 1) qb| >
iqg qd| > = (n  1) qd| >
iqg w | > = n w | >

(4.3)

which demonstrate that, whereas w keeps the ghost number of a state intact and unal-
tered, the operator qb increases the ghost number by one and qd reduces this number by
one. this property is similar to the operation of a laplacian, an exterior derivative and a
dual exterior derivative on a n-form dened on a compact manifold. thus, we see that the
degree of the dierential form is analogous to the ghost number in the hilbert space, the
dierential form itself is analogous to the quantum state in the hilbert space, a compact
manifold has an analogy with the quantum hilbert space and d,  and  = d + d are
qb , qd and w respectively. it is a notable point that d and  can also be identied with
qab and qad in the brst formalism.

5 hodge decomposition theorem and topological invariants

it is obvious from the algebra (4.2) and the consideration of the ghost number of states
(qb| >, qd| > and w | >) in (4.3) that one can now implement the hodge decompo-
sition theorem in the language of brst and dual-brst charges (see, e.g., [3], [7] ,[8])

| >n= | >n + qb|  >n1 + qd | >n+1

(5.1)

by which, any state | >n in the quantum hilbert space with ghost number n can be
decomposed into a harmonic state | >n, a brst exact state qb| >n1 and a dual-brst
exact state qd| >n+1. to rene the brst cohomology, however, we have to choose a
representative state as the physical state from the total states of the quantum hilbert space.
let us pick out here the physical state as the harmonic state (|phys >= | >) from the
hodge decomposed state (5.1). the number of such harmonic states is nite for a given

8

physical theory as it represents the number of solutions to the laplace equation (see, e.g.,
ref. [2]). by denition, such a state would satisfy the following conditions:

w |phys >= 0,

qb |phys >= 0,

qd |phys >= 0.

(5.2)

due to the simple form of the equations of motion (a = 0, c = 0,  c = 0) for the
basic elds in the theory, it is very convenient to express them in the normal modes [21]

a(x, t) = z
c(x, t) = z
c(x, t) = z

dk

dk

dk

(k)eikx i
(2)1/2(2k0)1/2 h a(k)eikx + a
(2)1/2(2k0)1/2 h c(k) eikx + c(k) eikx i
(2)1/2(2k0)1/2 h b(k) eikx + b(k) eikx i

(5.3)

where k are the 2d momenta with the components (k0, k1 = k). the on-shell nilpotent
symmetry transformations (2.2) and (3.4), that are generated by the charges qb and qd,
can now be exploited to yield (see, e.g., [21, 22] for details):

(k)] = k c(k),

[qb, a
[qb, a(k)] = kc(k),
{qb, c(k)} = 0,
{qb, c(k)} = 0,
{qb, b(k)} = ika
,
{qb, b(k)} = +ika,

[qd, a
(k)] = kb(k)
[qd, a(k)] =  kb(k)
{qd, c(k)} = ika

{qd, c(k)} = i ka
{qd, b(k)} = 0
{qd, b(k)} = 0.

similarly, the casimir operator w generates the following commutation relations:

(k)] = ik2(a),

[w, a(k)] = ik2 a
[w, a
[w, c(k)] = [w, c(k)] = [w, b(k)] = [w, b(k)] = 0.

we are now in a position to dene the physical vacuum |vac > as

qb|vac > = qd|vac > = w |vac > = 0
a|vac > = c(k)|vac >= b(k)|vac >= 0.

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

a single photon state |e(k), vac > with polarization vector e can be created from the
physical vacuum by the application of a creation operator ea
|vac > |e(k), vac >.
the physicality criteria: qb|e(k), vac >= (k  e)c(k)|vac >= 0, qd|e(k), vac >=
ekb(k)|vac >= 0 lead to the transversality (k  e = 0) of the photon and the condition
ek = 0 between e and k. together, these conditions (due to the presence of extended
symmetries) remove both the physical degrees of freedom of the 2d photon and imply the
masslessness condition k2 = 0 (see, e.g., ref. [22] for more discussions).

the operation of the w operator on a single photon state (i.e., w |e(k), vac >=
ik2 e(a)|vac >= 0) implies the on-shell condition (a = 0  k2 = 0) as well as the
masslessness condition (k2 = 0) for the photon. the other relations: k  e = 0, ek = 0,

9

emerging from the operation of qb and qd on a single photon state, are unique solutions
to k2 = 0. thus, in a subtle way, w |phys >= 0 does imply the validity of qb|phys >= 0
and qd|phys >= 0. if basic symmetries are the central guiding principle, the operation
of the w operator on a single physical photon state in 2d is superuous (in some sense)
because the symmetry corresponding to w can be derived from the symmetries generated
by q(b,b) and q(d,d). this fact is encoded in the expression for the operator w (cf. (4.1))
which can be re-expressed as

w = z dx d

dx [ 1

2 b2  1

2 b2 ]  0

as x   

(5.7)

due to the equation of motion b +  b = 0. one can not think of the o-shell
validity of the expression for w in (4.1) because of the considerations of brst cohomology.
the presence of the two nilpotent symmetries corresponding to q(b,b) and q(d,d) and the
requirement that: q(b,b)|phys >= 0, q(d,d)|phys >= 0, forces the physical 2d photon to
always satisfy the on-shell (a = 0) as well as the mass-shell (k2 = 0) condition. thus,
there is no escape from the condition w  0 for a topological eld theory where all the
physical degrees of freedom are gauged away by symmetries alone. the topological nature
of the theory is reected by the presence of the topological invariants on the 2d manifold.
the two sets of these invariants, w.r.t. both the conserved ( qb = 0, qd = 0) and o-shell
nilpotent (q2

b = 0, q2

d = 0) charges qb and qd, are
jk[ck] = i ck

ik[ck] = i ck

vk,

wk

(k = 0, 1, 2)

(5.8)

where ck are the k-dimensional homology cycles in the 2d manifold and k-form vk and wk
for the 2d free u(1) gauge theory are juxtaposed as:

v0 = b c,
v1 = [ ba + ic c ] dx,
v2 = i[a c  1
2

w0 = b c
w1 = [ cc  i ba ] dx

c f] dx  dx, w2 = i[c a + c

2 (  a)] dx  dx .

(5.9)
it can be seen that v0 and w0 are brst (bv0 = 0) and co-brst invariant (dw0 = 0)
and v2 and w2 are closed (dv2 = 0) and co-closed (w2 = 0) respectively. using the
canonical (anti)commutation relations with iqg, it can be checked that the ghost numbers
for (v0, v1, v2) are (+1, 0, 1) and that of (w0, w1, w2) are (1, 0, +1) respectively. this
fact can be succinctly expressed (for k = 0, 1, 2) as:

i[qg, vk] = (1)1k (k  1) vk
i[qg, wk] = (1)1k (1  k) wk.

these invariants (for k = 1, 2) obey the following relations (see, e.g., [23], [24], [18])

bvk =  d vk1,
dwk =   wk1,

d = dx 
 = i dx  

(5.10)

(5.11)

10

where d and  are the exterior and dual-exterior derivatives on the 2d compact manifold.
both these sets of topological invariants are related to each-other by the duality transfor-
mations (3.7) as ik  jk under the sustitutions: b  i b, c  i c,   i .

using the on-shell nilpotent brst- and dual-brst transformations (2.2) and (3.4), it
will be interesting to verify that, modulo some total derivatives, the lagrangian density
(3.2) can be written as the sum of brst- and co-brst invariant parts:

 lb = 1

2 d[ iec ]  1

2 b[ i(  a) c ].

(5.12)

b = 0, 2

2 ec, s2 =  1

the invariance of this lagrangian density under brst and dual brst transformations is
easy to see because 2
d = 0 and {d, b}  0 as the laplacian operator goes to zero
(w  0) for the validity of the equations of motion. furthermore, the expressions in the
square brackets in (5.12) are brst invariant (i.e., b[iec] = 0) and co-brst invariant
(i.e., d[i(  a) c] = 0). using the fact that qr (r = b, d) is the generator of transformation
r = i  [, qr], where (+) stands for the (anti)commutator corresponding to  being
(fermionic)bosonic in nature, it can be seen that (5.12) can be written as: lb = {qd, s1} +
2 (  a) c. this shows that the free u(1) topological gauge
{qb, s2} for s1 = 1
eld theory is similar in form as the witten type theories [24] but completely dierent in
outlook from the schwarz type theories [25]. to be very precise, the free u(1) topological
gauge eld theory is somewhat dierent from ref.
[24] too. this is mainly because of
the fact that, in our discussions, there are two conserved and nilpotent charges w.r.t.
which the topological invariants are dened whereas in ref. [24] there exists only a single
brst charge which is obtained due to the presence of topological shift- and local gauge
symmetries. in our discussions, there is no shift symmetry at all. thus, from symmetry
point of view, the 2d free u(1) gauge theory is more like schwarz type theories. it can
be seen, however, that the symmetric energy-momentum tensor (t) for the lagrangian
density (3.2) (or (5.12))

t =  1

2 [ e + (  a) ] a  1
 i cc  i cc   lb,

2[ e + (  a) ]a

(5.13)

has the same form as the witten- and schwarz type of topological eld theories because it
can be re-expressed as:

t = {qb, v (1)

 } + {qd, v (2)

 },

where the exact expression for v s, in terms of the local elds, are

 = 1
v (1)
 = 1
v (2)

2[  c a +  c a + (  a) c ],
2[ ca +  ca   ec ].

it can be checked that the partition functions as well as the expectation values of the brst
invariants, co-brst invariants and the topological invariants are metric independent .

 we have taken here only the at minkowski metric. however, our arguments are valid even if we take

into account a nontrivial metric. the metric independence of the measure has been shown in ref. [23].

the key point to show this fact in the framework of brst cohomology is the requirement
that qb|phys >= 0 and qd|phys >= 0 (see, e.g., ref.
[18] for details) and the metric
independence of the path integral measure (see, e.g., ref. [23]).

6 conclusions

it is obvious that the usual nilpotent brst transformations correspond to a symmetry
in which the two-form f = da (e.g., electric eld e in 2 d) of the u(1) gauge theory
remains invariant. the nilpotent dual-brst charge is the generator of a transformation
in which the gauge-xing term ((  a) = a) remains invariant. the anticommutator of
these two transformations corresponds to a symmetry that is generated by the casimir
operator for the whole algebra. under this conserved operator, it is the ghost term that
remains invariant. basically, the presence of brst- and dual brst symmetries imply the
existence of two gauge symmetries: e  e +  k, e  e +   k (for  and  being
arbitrary constants) in the theory. in the present work, these extended symmetries have
been exploited together to gauge away the dynamical degrees of freedom of 2d photon
so that this theory becomes topological. the form of the lagrangian density (5.12), the
appearance of symmetric energy-momentum tensor (5.14) and the existence of brst- and
co-brst invariants in (5.9) conrm this (topological) nature of the theory. in fact, it is a
new type of topological eld theory which captures together some of the salient features of
both witten- and schwarz type of theories. it is an interesting venture to generalize these
symmetries to 2d free (having no interaction with matter elds) [26] as well as interacting
non-abelian gauge theories. furthermore, it will be nice to explore the physical impact of
these kind of symmetries in the context of physical 4d interacting gauge theories. in fact,
as a rst preliminary step in this direction, it has been shown in ref. [19] that the dual-
brst transformation da =   c on the abelian gauge eld corresponds to the
chiral transformation on the dirac elds for fermions in 2d interacting u(1) gauge theory.
thus, the abj anomalies appear in the theory for the proof of conservation laws at the
quantum level. it is, therefore, expected that the full strength of brst cohomology and
hodge decomposition theorem might shed some light on the abj anomalies and provide
a clue to the well known result that in 2d, the anomalous gauge theory is consistent,
unitary and amenable to particle interpretation [27,28]. the insights gained in 2d might
turn out to be useful for the generalization of hodge decomposition to physical 4d gauge
theories. these are some of the issues which are under investigation and the results will be
reported elsewhere.
