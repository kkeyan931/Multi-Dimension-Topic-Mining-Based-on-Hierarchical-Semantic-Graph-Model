abstract

we derive model independent, non-perturbative supersymmetric
sum rules for the gravitational quadrupole moments of arbitrary-spin
particles in any n = 1 supersymmetric theory. these sum rules se-
lect a preferred value of h = 1 where the h-factor is the gravita-
tional quadrupole analog of the gyromagnetic ratio or g-factor. this
value of h = 1 corresponds identically to the preferred eld theory value
obtained by tree-level unitarity considerations. the presently derived
h-factor sum rule complements and generalizes previous work on elec-
tromagnetic moments where g = 2 was shown to be preferred by both
supersymmetric sum rule and tree-level unitarity arguments.

1. introduction.

supersymmetry and gravitational . . .

in models with unbroken supersymmetry, it is often the case that the nature of the su-
persymmetry algebra leads to many powerful results on the structure of the theory itself.
such results often take the form of model independent sum rules that must be obeyed by
the states in the supersymmetric spectrum. for example, the added constraint of unbro-
ken supersymmetry requires that the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron (as the spin-1/2
member of a chiral multiplet) is given exactly by g = 2 [1]. such results have since been
generalized to yield constraints on the electromagnetic multipole moments of any massive
particle state in n = 1 [2,3] and n = 2 [4] supermultiplets. these sum rules were de-
rived using general principles and hold for any electromagnetic current commuting with
supersymmetry.

in this letter we apply similar techniques to the study of gravitational interactions in a
theory with unbroken supersymmetry and derive sum rules for the gravitational quadrupole
moments of the particle states in arbitrary n = 1 massive supermultiplets. following [5],
we dene an h-factor, which is the gravitational analog of the gyromagnetic ratio. the
h-factors of the dierent states in a massive n = 1 supermultiplet are no longer arbitrary,
but are related through the gravitational quadrupole sum rule; they are determined in
terms of a single real quantity (which may be taken as the h-factor of the central member
of the supermultiplet). furthermore, supersymmetry selects a natural value of h = 1,
which in addition has the property of yielding tree-level unitarity up to the planck scale for
gravitational interactions [6,7,5]. in this sense, the h-factor sum rule and its consequences
resemble those obtained for the usual gyromagnetic ratio, where the preferred value of
g = 2 was similarly selected by both tree-level unitarity [8,9] and supersymmetric sum rule
[2] considerations (for yet another reason, see [10]).

indeed our derivation of the h-factor sum rules follows the method of [2], and involves
the transformation properties of a conserved stress tensor t that commutes with the
n = 1 supersymmetry algebra. the main complication in obtaining the sum rules, that
was not present in [2], is the requirement of working to second order in the momentum
transfer in the appropriate matrix elements. this, however, has been addressed in [3],
where a generalization to arbitrary electromagnetic multipole moments was presented.

although the procedure used in obtaining the sum rules is by now standard, care must
be taken in manipulating the supersymmetry algebra since various factors from dierent
sources have to be combined in a precise manner. we follow the conventions for the dirac
algebra and n = 1 supersymmetry given in [3]. thus we start with the n = 1 algebra
written in the form {q, q} = 2()p, so that in the rest frame of a massive single
particle state, we have

after proper normalization, the supersymmetry algebra, (1), corresponds to a cliord
algebra with two fermionic degrees of freedom. thus irreducible massive n = 1 repre-
sentations are generated by acting with creation operators qr
on a superspin-j cliord

vacuum, |ji, that is annihilated by ql

since the supercharges ql,r

are operators of spin 1/2, we use a shorthand notation
of labeling the spin-j cliord vacuum by |0i, along with the superpartner states |i, |i
and |li, which are generated by (normalized) qr
, respectively. while
this notation is initially convenient, it only addresses the action of the supercharges on
the cliord vacuum. the actual states in the multiplet are only obtained after taking the
clebsch-gordan combination of angular momenta between the spin-j cliord vacuum and
the spins [(1/2) + 2(0)], corresponding to [(|i, |i) + |0i + |li].

since the gravitational quadrupole moment is dened in terms of moments of the
stress tensor, we proceed with an examination of the multiplet containing t . for a su-
perconformal theory, this is the multiplet of currents (t , j, j(5)
 ), where  is a spinor
index. more generally, theories invariant under n = 1 supersymmetry may nevertheless vi-
 6= 0, supersymmetric invariance, j 6= 0, or r-invariance,
olate dilatation invariance, t 
j(5)

 6= 0, or any combination of these symmetries.

we rst consider the case of ordinary n = 1 supersymmetry, without conformal

invariance, but with a conserved r-current:

j 6= 0,
the resulting multiplet of currents contains (j(5)
antisymmetric tensor, and has the following transformation properties:

transformations on the conserved current, t , gives

the matrix elements of this equation between single particle states which belong to the
same n = 1 multiplet give rise to sum rules for the gravitational multipoles of the particle
states.

the gravitational moments may be obtained by performing a multipole expansion of
the matrix elements hj , m, ~p|t|j, m, 0i of the stress tensor. while rotational symmetry
allows the matrix elements to be decomposed in terms of spherical tensors (see e.g. [11]) or
cartesian tensors of denite angular momentum [12], we nd it sucient to take a general
expansion with indenite angular momentum terms:

hj , m, ~p|t00|j, m, 0i =

(ip)i1 (ip)i2    (ip)ilhj , m, 0, |m (l)

note that the gravitational dipole term in the expansion of t00, m (1)

, can be removed

by translating t00 and choosing the translation di appropriately, i.e.:

h~p|t00(~x + ~d)|0i = h~p| exp(idipi)t00(x)|0i = h~p|(1 + idipi + ..)t00|0i
= h~p|t00|0i + im (0)dipi + o(p2) = m (0) + ipim (1)

i + im (0)dipi +    .
(10)

therefore there is no physical content in m (1)

i

, and we take it to vanish henceforth.

it was demonstrated in [5] that, outside of the newtonian limit, the nonrelativistic
denition of the gravitational quadrupole has to be amended. the general expression for
the quadrupole moment (in d = 4) is [5]:

supersymmetry and gravitational . . .

as in the electromagnetic case [3], general multipole moment sum rules are derived

by taking the double supersymmetry variation of the conserved stress tensor t ,

t = [q, [q, t]]

= qqt  qt q  qt q + t qq,

(14)

and evaluating it between single particle states h| and |i. since t is known, and
is given by (6), the right hand side of (14) then relates the matrix elements of t among
the superpartner states generated by q. by choosing the initial and nal states to be the
superspin-j cliord vacuum, and by picking l = 0, we nd

h, ~p|r t|, 0i = h, ~p|t qrq|, 0i  h, 0|q(p)l1(~p )t rq|, 0i,

(15)

where q(p) denotes the lorentz boost of q, namely q(p) = l1(~p )ql(~p ), and |, ~p i =
l(~p )|, 0i. this expression provides the basis of determining both the vanishing and
diagonal sum rules.

for the vanishing sum rule, we set l = 0 so that only r is active. since eq. (6)

indicates that rr t = 0, the sum rule (15) becomes

h, ~p|t rqrq|, 0i = 0.

(16)

this demonstrates that all matrix elements of the stress tensor vanish between states |0i
and |li, and hence that there are no o-diagonal moments between the two spin-j states
of the supermultiplet.

for the diagonal sum rule, we choose r = 0 and nd instead

h, 0|lql1(~p )t rq|, 0i = 2m (l0r)h, ~p|t|, 0i

 h, ~p|r l t|, 0i  h, 0|[l1(~p ), lq]trq|, 0i.

(17)

the rst line of (17) essentially relates the matrix elements in the superpartner state with
those in the original state, while the second line provides correction terms originating from
supersymmetry and from lorentz boosts.

for the lorentz boost correction, we make use of the fact that q transforms as a

spinor to derive

where the terms that have been dropped are all trace-like, and do not contribute to the
static moments. specializing to the gravitational quadrupole moment, we are interested
in the supersymmetry variation rlt00. using eq. (6) we nd that

r l t00 =  pl0

note that the antisymmetric tensor t drops out when the two equations are combined:

r lt00 = 2pi(l0

ijr)t0j + pi(lir)t00 + o(p2).

(21)

in particular, this is a consequence of the complete relativistically correct denition of the
gravitational quadrupole moment, (11).

the diagonal sum rule now takes the form:

1
2m h, 0|lql1(~p )t00rq|, 0i =(l0r)h, ~p|t00|, 0i

 iijk pj

m

(lkr)h, ~p|t0i|, 0i,

(22)

where we have omitted terms of order p2. due to rotational invariance it is sucient to
examine the 33 component of the quadrupole moment. by substituting the denitions
of the quadrupole and angular momentum matrix elements, (13), into eq. (22) and by
equating terms of the same order in momentum transfer, we arrive at the following diagonal
sum rules:

h|q33|i = h0|q33|0i +
h|q33|i = h0|q33|0i

3m h0|j3|0i,

(23)

to derive the sum rules for the physical states of the superspin-j multiplet, we add
the supersymmetry generated spin (|i or |i) to the original spin using the appropriate
clebsch-gordan combinations

for a given state of spin j, the quadrupole moment is characterized by a single quantity,
q(j). by convention this is taken to be the matrix element of q33 in the |j, m = ji state.
more generally, by the wigner-eckart theorem, we may write (j  1)

q(j) =

j(2j  1)

3m2  j(j + 1)h, j, m|q33|, j, mi.

(25)

2 , j, j, j  1

we now recall that the massive superspin-j supermultiplet contains four states, of spins
(j + 1
2 ). using the vanishing sum rule and the ability to choose |li as an
alternate cliord vacuum [2], we note that both spin-j states have the same gravita-
tional quadrupole moment. thus for the four states there are three separate quantities,
(q(j+ 1

2 ), q(j), q(j 1

q(j+ 1

2 ) = q(j) +

2 )), which are related by the sum rules (j  3/2):

(26)

for j = 1/2 and j = 1 the sum rules simplify to

q( 3

(j = 1).

(27)

the gravitational quadrupole moment, qij, may be related to an h-factor, which is the
gravitational analog of the electromagnetic g-factor [5,13,14,15]. the h-factor may be
dened in terms of the coupling of a spin-j eld  to the riemann tensor that arises in
the equations of motion as

(  m 2) + h[r

1

2  1

2 ] +    = 0,

(28)

where  is the lorentz generator in the spin-j representation. in the non-relativistic
limit the riemann coupling in (28) gives rise to a shift in energy

(29)

where we have used the fact that in four dimensions the components of the riemann tensor
are given in terms of the newtonian potential  as

rijkl = ikjl + jlik  iljk  jkil.

(30)

note that, out of the original lorentz generators, only the angular momentum generators
ij = ijkjk remain in this limit.

the h-factor can now be related to the gravitational quadrupole qij by recalling that
the change in energy of a particle in a static, slowly varying external newtonian potential
 due to the quadrupole is

e =

qijij.

(31)

supersymmetry and gravitational . . .

comparing (29) with (31), we obtain the relation

qij =

(32)

where the latter term is necessary to make qij traceless. nevertheless this has no eect in
eq. (31) since ii = 0 in vacuum. note the resemblance between the relations (32) for
the h-factor and i = ge

2m ji for the g-factor.

combining the h-factor denition, (32), with the quadrupole matrix element, (25), we
nd hj = 3m
j(2j1) q(j) (where the quadrupole moment is only well dened for spins  1).
in terms of h-factors, the quadrupole sum rules, (26), now take on the nal simpler form:

(34)

the terms proportional to (hj1) are related to a gravitational transition moment between
the j  1
2 states of the multiplet, and vanish when h = 1, yielding the possible value of
h = 1 for all members of the superspin-j multiplet. this result from supersymmetry
matches with those obtained previously [7,14,15,5] that similarly suggest that h = 1 is
a natural value for the h-factor, in much the same way that g = 2 is natural for the
gyromagnetic ratio.

finally we would like to extend our results to theories invariant under n = 1 su-
persymmetry but violating r symmetry. in this case the resulting multiplet of currents
contains (j(5)

while added terms arise due to the non-conservation of j(5)
 , they nevertheless do not
contribute to the double variation of t00 to the order that would aect the quadrupole
matrix elements. thus r lt00 is unchanged from (21), and hence the resulting sum
rules for the gravitational quadrupole moments coincide with those derived above for the
r-invariant theory.

although we have focused our attention on gravitational quadrupole moments, the
sum rules we have derived may easily be generalized along the lines of [5] to encompass
arbitrary gravitational multipoles. while such higher moments may lack clear physical
signicance, they many nevertheless provide a means for examining higher derivative cou-
plings to gravity, especially in a string context. additionally, the extension of the above to
the case of extended supersymmetry should allow for the study of graviphoton sum rules
in a model independent manner since the corresponding currents would indeed fall into
the gravity sector of the theory.
