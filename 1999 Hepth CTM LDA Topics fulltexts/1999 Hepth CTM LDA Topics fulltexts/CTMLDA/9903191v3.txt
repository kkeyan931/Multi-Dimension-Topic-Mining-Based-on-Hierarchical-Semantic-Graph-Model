abstract

we compute the boundary entropies for the allowed boundary con-
ditions of the su (2)-invariant principal chiral model at level k = 1. we
used the reection factors determined in a previous work. as a by-product
we obtain some miscellaneous results such as the ground-state energy for
mixed boundary conditions as well as the degeneracies of the kondo model
in the underscreened and exactly screened cases. all these computations
are in perfect agreement with known results.

1 introduction

boundary integrable models in (1 + 1)-dimensions have attracted some atten-
tion in recent years, especially in view of their successful application to quantum
impurity problems. the typical examples are the kondo model [12], dissipative
quantum mechanics [36], quantum hall liquids with constriction [37] and the
callan-rubakov model [21]. the common minimal denominator in these sit-
uations is the fact that the bulk theory is conformally invariant and it is the
boundary that is responsible for the broken scale invariance. here, our purpose
is to consider the alternative situation, where the boundary respects the confor-
mal invariance of the theory and the renormalization group (rg) trajectory is
controlled by a bulk perturbation. the model in question is the su (2) principal
chiral model (pcm) at level k = 1. in a previous work [27], we proposed the set
of permissible boundary conditions suggested by the symmetries of the problem
and computed the corresponding minimal reection factors that are compatible
with the bulk scale invariant limit (kondo problem). in this work, we wish to
go one step further and study the nite size eects both in the infrared (ir) and
ultraviolet (uv) limits, in analogy with the bulk problem [10]. this is done by
boundary thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) [17]-[19], [26]. to motivate our
conjecture, we compute the boundary entropies for the quasi-particles of the
kondo model in the exactly screened and underscreened cases. this has already
been done previously [43]-[48]. however, this explicit computation will be used
as a means of comparison for further generalizations.

for one of the boundary conditions the boundary degeneracy is shown to be
noninteger. furthermore, the typical decrease of entropy along the rg ow from
the unstable uv xed point to a more stable ir one is found to be respected.
this g-theorem was conjectured for theories that are scale invariant in the bulk
[20]. however, it also seems to hold here.

finally, we use our results to conjecture the form of the ground state energy

for mixed boundary conditions in the ir limit.

2 the principal chiral model and the kondo ef-

fect

the integrability of the pcm has been studied by various authors [1]-[11], [15],
[16]. the rg analysis reveals that it interpolates between two xed points.
the crossover between the two limiting behaviours introduces a mass scale that
breaks the conformal invariance. the rg trajectory terminates at the ir xed
point where the theory becomes massless at all distances. it is characterized
by a conformal eld theory based on two su (2)k kac-moody algebras (at level
k). al.b.zamolodchikov and a.b.zamolodchikov [10] proposed the background
factorized scattering in terms of massless particles that leads to the correct tba
equations for k = 1. zamolodchikovs c-function was shown to take the values
cuv = 3 and cir = 1 at the xed points [10], [35]. the latter coincides with

the central charge of the su (2)1 conformal eld theory [9].

the multi-channel kondo model ([12], [13], [38]-[48]), on the other hand, con-
sists of a k-tuple of (1 + 1) free massless fermions on the half-line antiferromag-
netically coupled to a xed impurity of spin s sitting at the boundary (x = 0)1.
let us denote the coupling constant by . the rg ow interpolates between
an unstable uv xed point, where the impurity is decoupled ( = 0) and a
strongly coupled ir one, where the spin of the impurity is screened ( = 2
k+2 ).
the eective spin thus becomes q = sk/2. as before, the crossover introduces
a scale tk called the kondo temperature, [39]-[42].
for k = 1, the bulk spectrum of both theories consists of stable massless
particles:
left- and right-movers. at level k = 1 the kink structure of the
particles and boundary impurity is eroded. the on-mass-shell momenta of the
particles are parametrised in terms of the rapidity variables  < ,  < :

e = p = m

2 e,

for right-movers,

e = p = m

2 e 

,

for left-movers.

(1)

the right- and left-movers are represented by the symbols ra() and lb(),
respectively, where a, b =  are the su (2) isotopic spin indices.

the su (2) invariant r-r scattering [10] is given by:



ra(1)rb(2) = scd

notice that when   , this amplitude becomes trivial.
let us now consider a reecting boundary that preserves the integrability. in
the kondo problem we distinguish two situations [13]. in the exactly screened
case, the impurity spin is completely screened yielding a zero eective spin
(q = 0). the impurity is thus a su (2) singlet.
in the underscreened case
(s = 1), the eective spin is q = 1/2 and the impurity becomes a su (2)
doublet.

in the former case, we dene the operator b which, acting on the vacuum

|0 >, creates a boundary state |b > [23], i.e.:
|b >= b|0 > .

(8)

the reection matrix rb
a() is the amplitude corresponding to a right-mover of
rapidity  and spin a being reected into a left-moving state of rapidity  and
spin b2:
(9)

ra()b = rb

a()lb()b.

the fact that the boundary impurity is a su (2) singlet implies the following
diagonal form:

rb

a() = b

ark(),

where

rk() = u () = tanh(cid:18) 

2 

i

4(cid:19) .

(10)

(11)

similarly, for the underscreened case, we introduce the operator bb (b = ),
which acting on the vacuum creates a boundary state with spin b. the reection
amplitude rcd

ab() is:

ra()bb = rcd

ab()lc()bd,

fk() = i

 gk(),

gk() = r().



here it is understood that  stands for q  k, where q is the rapidity of the
quasi-particle and k is associated with the kondo temperature, tk = ek .
in the case of the pcm, we know that in the ir limit there are two boundary
conditions compatible with the conformal symmetry [24], [25]. each one of them
is associated with a primary eld of the su (2)1 conformal eld theory. these
elds have conformal dimensions  = 0 and  = 1/4 and have been identied
with the identity operator and the eld g of the wess-zumino-witten action,
respectively [14].

similarly, there is an amplitude rcd

3 tba in the l-channel

3.1 fixed boundary conditions
we start by considering a system of n right-movers with rapidities 1, , n
and m left-movers with rapidities 
m in an interval of length r with
xed boundary conditions on both ends. since the reection matrix is diagonal
on both sides, we can assume that the bethe wave function vanishes at the two
extremes of the interval. we can thus impose a standing wave quantization
condition [18]. mathematically, this condition can be expressed in the form:

1, , 

exp(2irpk)r2(k)

l=1 u (k + l)qm

b (k|{}1m ) = 1,

j=1 u (k  

j)

(17)

k = 1, , n.

in the above equations it is understood that a = a and b = b. r() is the
reection amplitude in eqs.(11) or (15). the term 1
u(2k) arises because the
particle does not interact with itself. the transfer matrix t b
a(u|{}1n ) is the
2n  2n matrix dened by:

each dot represents an interaction described by the amplitude (3). following
the method described in ref.[10], we start by dening the pseudo-energies n and

where n is the density of n-magnons, n the density of n-magnon states

and en = n  n is the density of holes. the scattering matrices for particle-

magnon (sn) and magnon-magnon (snm) interactions are:

before we conclude this section, let us make one remark. notice that, from
(27), the magnons do not contribute to the boundary entropy. this is because
they account for the isotopic degrees of freedom. since for xed boundary
condition, the impurity is a singlet, the magnons will not be included. for
free boundary condition, on the other hand, the impurity becomes a doublet.
therefore its spin degrees of freedom contribute to the boundary degeneracy.
we thus expect the magnons to play a role here. indeed, this is what happens,
as we shall see in the next section.

3.2 free boundary conditions

let us assume that our system is now subject to free boundary condition at the
two extremes. we can assume that the standing wave condition (17) still holds
if we have free boundary conditions at the two extremes of the interval. the
following simple argument shows that this is indeed the case.

if the boundary satises the xed boundary condition, the bethe wave func-
tion vanishes there. consequently, it is reected o the boundary with a phase
shift of . the other boundary produces another shift of , bringing the bethe
wave function back to its original form. the end result is the standing wave.

for a free boundary the bethe wave function satises a neumann bound-
ary condition corresponding to zero ux of momentum accross the boundary.
consequently, it remains unscathed upon reection (no phase shift).

in summary, after two reections, the bethe wave function nds itself in its
original shape both for free as well as xed boundary conditions, provided the
same condition holds at the two boundaries.

proceeding with the same program that followed eq.(17), we obtain the

following set of bethe equations:

lm e+ 0 + 1
n + 1

2   l1 = 0,
m=0 lmnlm = 0,

2   l0 + 1
2  p

the evaluation of the boundary free energy leads to

n = 1, 2, ,.

let us check that our formulae yield the correct results for the kondo model.
first of all notice that hk() = sv (), and so:

log sv () = b

(43)

these results are in perfect agreement with ref.[43]-[48] for the underscreened
case q = s  k/2 = 1/2.

4 tba in the r-channel

the previous work allows us to conjecture the set of tba equations in the r-
channel.
in essence they are not very dierent from those in the l-channel.
they arise from imposing periodic boundary conditions on all cooper pairs
of the form ra()lb(), [17]. if 0() is the density of pairs with rapidity
in a small vicinity around , then the tba equations for these pairs and the
n-magnons are:

0+ 0 + 1
1+ 1 + 1
n + 1

2   l0 + 1
2   l0 + 1
2  p

m=1

2   l1 = 0,
2   l2 = 0,
lmnlm = 0;

(44)

n = 2, 3, ,.

the matrixelmn (m, n = 1, 2, ...,) is obtained from lmn by ommiting the rst

node. in the l-channel the particles and magnons contribute with 0() and
1(), respectively, to the boundary degeneracies. this contribution will trans-
late to 0 and 1 in eq.(44). if i(), associated with a particular boundary

condition , is of the form 1
 logs(2), then its contribution
i
to i() reads logk(), where k() = r(i/2  ).

 logr()  1



i

suppose we have xed boundary condition on one side and free on the other.
the contribution of the free boundary to 1 is logkk() where kk() =
rk(i/2  ) is given by the kondo reection amplitude (11). its contribution
in
to 0 is logkp (), where kp () = rp (i/2  ) is given by eq.(15).
principle its contribution should be loghp (). however, the amplitude in the
logarithm must be the one associated with the kernel in (2)
0 , which was shown
to be rp at the end of the previous section (cf.eqs.(36), (42)). finally, the
xed boundary does not contribute to 1 and its contribution to 0 amounts to
log kp ().

altogether, we have:

let us dene 0() = kp ()kp (), 1() = kk(), n() = 1, n = 2, 3, ,
and

n() = n() + logn(),

1() = logkk().

(cid:26) 0() = rm e  log(cid:2) kp ()kp ()(cid:3) ,

2   l0 + 1
2  p

2   l1 = 0,
m=0 lmn lm = 0;

ln() = log(1 + n()en ).

we can then rewrite eq.(44) in the form:

m re + 0 + 1
mnre + n + 1

n = 1, 2, ,.

now notice that 0() = kp ()kp () = 1 and lim 1() = lim kk() =
1. if we dene zn  en(+), we get the following system in the limit r  :



z0 = 0,

z1 = 1,

1 + zn =

sin2(cid:2) (n1)
p+1 (cid:3)

sin2[ 

p+1 ]

;

n = 2, 3, , p.

(48)

similarly, if we dene xn  en(), in the region rm << , we obtain the
system (25), as r  .

the standard eavluation of the free energy yields:

(45)

(46)

(47)

(49)

where l(x) is rodgers dilogarithm [32]:

f =

which is one of the conformal dimensions of the su (2)1 conformal theory. this

eld theory, [24], [25].

5 conclusions

let us restate our results. we computed the boundary degeneracies correspond-
ing to the two allowed boundary conditions for the pcm at level k = 1. this
was accomplished by quantizing the system in a nite box. we argued that for
the free boundary condition, the bethe wave function was subject to a neu-
mann condition preventing the ow of momentum accross the boundary. this
condition allows the exchange of isospin between the particles and the bound-
ary impurity. since the magnons are attached to these degrees of freedom, they
contribute to the boundary degeneracy. this situation is in contrast with the
xed boundary condition, which does not permit isospin permutation. the free
boundary condition was subsequently shown to yield a noninteger degeneracy.
as a consistency check, we compared our results in the bulk scale invariant limit
(u ()  1) with those of the kondo model.
ization from the more unstable uv xed point to the more stable ir one.

we stress that in all cases the boundary entropy decreases under renormal-

finally, we used the previous results to conjecture the form of the tba
equations in the r-channel and the ground-state energy, when we let our sys-
tem evolve between two distinct boundary states. the boundary conformal
eld theory approach of cardy [24] predicts a partition function of the form

may be tested numerically using the truncated systems (25), (26) and (48). we
expect to carry out that program in a future work.
