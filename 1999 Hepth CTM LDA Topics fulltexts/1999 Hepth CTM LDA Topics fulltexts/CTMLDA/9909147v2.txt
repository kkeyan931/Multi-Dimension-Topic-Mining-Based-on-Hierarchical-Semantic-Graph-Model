abstract

we show that conformal maps of simply connected domains with an analytic
boundary to a unit disk have an intimate relation to the dispersionless 2d toda
integrable hierarchy. the maps are determined by a particular solution to the
hierarchy singled out by the conditions known as string equations. the same
hierarchy locally solves the 2d inverse potential problem, i.e., reconstruction of the
domain out of a set of its harmonic moments. this is the same solution which is
known to describe 2d gravity coupled to c = 1 matter. we also introduce a concept
of the  -function for analytic curves.

1 introduction

by the riemann mapping theorem, any simply connected domain on the complex plane
with a boundary consisting of at least two points can be conformally mapped onto the
unit disk. however, the theorem does not say how to construct the map. we show that
the map is explicitly given by a solution of an integrable hierarchy of the hydrodynamic
type [1].

in this paper, we only consider simply connected domains bounded by an analytic
curve. we show that in this case conformal maps are given by a particular solution of
the dispersionless 2d toda hierarchy (see [2, 3] and references therein). surprisingly, this
solution obeys (and is selected by) the string equation familiar in topological gravity and
matrix models of 2d gravity [4, 5].

one may characterize a closed analytic curve by a set of harmonic moments of, say

the exterior of the domain surrounded by the curve and its area:

ck = zzexterior

zkdxdy ,

k  1;

c0 = zzinterior

dxdy

(1.1)

here z = x + iy and it is implied that the point z = 0 is inside the domain, whereas the
point z =  is outside. the integrals at k = 1, 2 are assumed to be properly regularized.
we assume this (innite) set to be given and address two problems:

(1) to nd the harmonic moments of the interior,

ck = zzinterior

zkdxdy ,

k  1,

(1.2)

and to reconstruct the curve.
it is known that if the domain is convex, the solution
is unique [6]. however, in general the domain can be reconstructed with some discrete
ambiguity. nevertheless, if the domain has a smooth boundary, then a small change of
moments uniquely determines a new domain (also with a smooth boundary). below we
address only the latter problem: to nd the deformation of a smooth closed curve under
a small deformation of the moments of the exterior of the domain bounded by the curve.
the integrable hierarchy gives the solution to this problem through the  -function, thus
suggesting a new concept - the  -function of the curve.

(2) to construct an invertible conformal map of the exterior of the unit circle onto

the exterior of the domain.

explicitly, the area and the set of moments of the exterior (and their complex conju-

gate) are identied with the times of the dispersionless 2d toda hierarchy as follows:

t  t0 =

c0


,

tk =

ck
k

,

tk =

ck
k

,

k  1.

(1.3)

we prove that the derivatives of the harmonic moments of the interior ck with respect
to the tj, tj enjoy the symmetry

ck
tj

=

cj
tk

,

ck
tj

=

 cj
tk

.

therefore, the moments of the interior can be expressed as derivatives of a single real
function which appears to be the logarithm of the  -function  (t, {tk}, {tk}) of the dis-
persionless 2d toda hierarchy:

vk 

ck



=

 log 

tk

,

vk 

ck


=

 log 

tk

,

k  1

(1.4)

the equation which determines the  -function (the dispersionless hirota equation) and
therefore the moments of the interior is given in sec. 5. supplemented by a proper initial
condition provided by the string equation, it solves the inverse moments problem for small
deformations of a simply connected domain with analytic boundary. the  -function at
tk = 0, k  3 is given in the appendix.

in its turn, the conformal map is determined by the dispersionless limit of the lax-
sato equations of the toda hierarchy. let z(w) be a univalent function that provides an
invertible conformal map of the exterior of the unit circle |w| > 1 to the exterior of the
domain. let us represent it by a laurent series

z(w) = rw +

ujwj



xj=0

(1.5)

the conditions that w =  is mapped to z =  and r is real x the map, so the
potentials r, uj are uniquely determined by the domain. the potentials of the conformal
map obey an innite set of dierential equations with respect to the times (harmonic
moments). they are evolution lax-sato equations of the hierarchy. the series z(w) is
identied with the lax function. the lax-sato equations derived in sec.4.

the coecients of the conformal map have an equivalent description in terms of the

 -function: the inverse map w(z) is explicitly given by the formula

log w = log z

a comment is in order. many equations of secs. 3-6 can be found in the literature on

dispersionless hierarchies [2, 3]. we adopt their proofs for conformal maps.

2 analytic curves and the schwarz function

let a closed analytic curve be the boundary of a simply connected domain on the complex
plane with coordinates z = x + iy, z = x  iy. the equation of the curve can be written
in the form

z = s(z)

(2.1)

thus the curve determines the function s(z) which is dened also outside the curve.
moreover it is an analytic function within some domain containing the curve. we call
the function s(z) the schwarz function of the curve (see e.g. [7]). its singularities encode
the information about the curve.

3

the schwarz function may not be an arbitrary function of z. it obeys the unitarity
condition: as is seen from (2.1), its complex conjugate function1 is equal to the inverse
function, i.e.,

s(s(z)) = z.

(2.2)

being an analytic function in a strip containing the curve, the schwarz function
can be decomposed into a sum of two functions s(z) = s(+)(z) + s()(z): one, s(+),
is holomorphic in the interior of the domain, the second, s(), is holomorphic in the
exterior. their expansions around z = 0 and z =  determine the harmonic moments
in the exterior (1.1) and interior (1.2) respectively:

s(+)(z) =

1




xk=1

ckzk1,

s()(z) =

1




xk=0

ckzk1

(2.3)

this follows from the contour integral representation of the moments

ck =

1

2i icurve

zks(z)dz ,

 < k < 

(2.4)

obtained from (1.1), (1.2) with the help of the green formula.

the schwarz function is closely related to conformal maps. consider the conformal
map (1.5) of the exterior of the unit circle to the exterior of the domain. the inverse
map sends a point z to a point w(z). let us invert this point with respect to the circle,
w  ( w)1 and map it back (it is known that the conformal can be extended into
some domain through the curve. we assume that the inverted point belongs to it. ).
this operation is carried out by the conjugate schwarz function s(z) = z(( w)1) or
s(z) = z(w1). obviously, if z belongs to the curve, then s(z) = z. therefore, we can
write s(z(w)) = z(w1).

summing up, we have two formal laurent series (see (1.3), (1.4) for the notation):

s(z) =

s(z) =

they are connected by the unitarity condition (2.2). the latter is resolved by the con-
formal maps

in their turn, the conformal maps are given by the series2



1a comment on the notation: given a laurent series f (z) =pj fjzj, we set f (z) =pj

2to avoid confusion, let us stress that the functions z(w) and z(w1) are complex conjugate only on

the curve, i.e., at |w| = 1.

z(w) = s(z(w1))
z(w1) = s(z(w))

they and the unitarity condition (2.7) establish relations between harmonic moments
of the exterior tk, harmonic moments of the interior vk and the coecients of the confor-
mal map uj. below we nd an innite set of dierential equations, which determine the
evolution of the potentials and the moments of the interior in times  moments of the
interior.

3 symplectic structure of conformal maps and gen-

erating function

deformations of the domain and, therefore, of the conformal map reveal the symplec-
tic structure. in this section we show that the pairs logw, t and z(w, t), z(w1, t) are
canonical:

{z(w, t), z(w1, t)} = 1

(3.1)

where {, } is the poisson bracket with respect to w and the area t (all moments of the
exterior tk, tk are kept xed). for any two functions f (w, t), g(w, t) the poisson bracket
is dened by

(3.2)

{f, g} = w

f
w

g
t

g

f
t

we refer to (3.1) as the string equation3. this equation suggests that deformations of
conformal maps form a group with respect to the composition. to prove it, let us rewrite
the l.h.s. in two equivalent forms with the help of (2.7), (2.8). first, let us compute the
derivatives of z(w1, t) in (3.1) treating it as the composition s(z(w, t), t) as is in (2.8):

 z(w1, t)

t

=

s(z, t)

s(z, t)

z(w, t)

z

t

,

 z(w1, t)

w

=

s(z, t)

z(w, t)

z

w

(3.3)

as a result, we obtain:

{z(w, t), z(w1, t)} = w

z(w, t)

s(z, t)

w

t

similarly, treating z(w, t) in (3.1) as the composition s(z(w1, t), t) we get

{z(w, t), z(w1, t)} = w

 z(w1, t)

 s(z, t)

w

t

.

(3.4)

(3.5)

in the r.h.s. of these equations the derivatives in t is taken at xed z or z and then
understood as functions of w.

now, using the series (2.5) and (2.9), we conclude that the r.h.s. of (3.4) is 1 plus
positive powers in w. however, the series (2.6) and (2.10) tell that the r.h.s. of (3.5) is
1 plus negative powers in w. this prompts us to (3.1).

the rest follows from the symplectic structure by treating deformations of the con-
formal map (2.9) along the lines of the multi-time hamilton-jacobi formalism [2, 8, 9].

let us introduce the generating function (z, t) of the canonical transformation

(logw, t)  (z, s). its dierential, d = sdz + log wdt, implies that

s =

log w =

where v0 obeys

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

similarly to the schwarz function, the generating function can be represented as
the sum (z) = (+)(z) + ()(z)  v0/2 of functions, which derivatives s()(z) =
z()(z) are analytical in the exterior and the interior of the domain. they have a simple
electrostatic interpretation. say, (+)(z), is the (complex) 2d coulomb potential in the
interior of the domain created by a homogeneously distributed charge in the exterior.
in its turn, the ()(z) is the complex coulomb potential in the exterior created by a
homogeneous charge in the interior:

taken at a xed z. the hamiltonians, being treated as functions of z and t obey the

and similarly for hk.

the hamiltonians hj written in terms of the canonical variables w, t determine the
evolution of the conformal map z(w) and z(w1) with respect to the hierarchical times
tk (harmonic moments):

z(w)

tj

 z(w1)

tj

= {hj, z(w)}

= {hj, z(w1)}

(4.5)

(4.6)

note that these formulas can be extended to j = 0: h0 = log w generates the ow
t0 = t. consistency of these equations acquires the form of the zero curvature condition
tj hi  tihj + {hi, hj} = 0. it is equivalent to (4.3) rewritten in the variable w.

now we are ready to prove that the hamiltonians hi and hi have the form

hj(w) = (cid:16)zj(w)(cid:17)+
hj(w) = (cid:16)zj(w1)(cid:17)

the symbols (f (w)) mean a truncated laurent series, where only terms with positive
(negative) powers of w are kept, (f (w))0 is a constant part (w0) of the sewries.

to this end, let us dierentiate hj by w and t, and express the result in terms of

derivatives of z and s. we begin with the formula

hj

=

z(w)

z(w1)

w

tj



z(w)

z(w1)

which is a simple consequence of the denition (4.2). replacing here z(w) by s(z) as
before, we get:

=

 z
w

 s(z)
tj

k=1 tj vk zk1 is a regular function of w at w =
using (2.6), we nd that tj
0 and its taylor expansion starts from w2. thus hj is also a regular function in w.
moreover, from the (4.4) we nd that hj is a polynomial in w of the degree j. thus,
being so, we have hj = (zj)+ + (zj)0  1
2tj v0. to complete the proof, let us nd the
w0-term in the laurent series

s(z) = p

it comes from the rst term of the r.h.s. of this expression and, together with (3.7),
gives the desired result: 2(thj)0 = 2tj logr = ttj v0 = t(zj)0. the dynamics of
the conformal map with respect to tk can be obtained from (4.5), (4.6) by the comlex

conjugatiion. note that the poisson bracket changes the sign as w  w = w1 that is
just consistent with the minus sign in (4.2). hence hj = hj(w1) as is in (4.8).

the lax-sato equations with the hamiltonians 4.7), (4.8) imply that the coecients
of the conformal map obey an innite set of non-linear dierential equations known as the
dispersionless 2d toda hierarchy. the rst and the most familiar equation of the hierar-
chy is the long wave limit of the toda lattice equation: 2(r2)/t2 = 2log (r2)/t1t1.
we also mention another relation between the conformal map and the hamiltonians:

z(w) = h1 +

1
2

t1 +



xk=2

ktk hk1

(4.11)

(and a similar equation for z(w1)). it can be immediately obtained from the unitarity
condition (2.7), (2.8) by comparing the positive and constant parts of the laurent series
in w and using (4.7), (4.8). these formulas illustrate an important relation between
harmonic moments and conformal maps.
if all moments tk = 0 for k > n, then the
laurent series of the conformal map (1.5) is truncated: uj = 0 for j  n. this, in
particular, gives another proof of sakais theorem [10]: if all but the rst three moments
t, t1, t2 of the complement of a simply connected domain on the complex plane are zero,
then the domain is an ellipse.

the lax-sato equations (4.5), (4.6) supplemented by the string equation (3.1) give
the complete set of dierential equations for the potentials uj of the conformal map as
functions of moments t, tk, tk. they uniquely determine small deformations of the map
and eventually the curve.

symmetry of moments and the  -function of con-
formal maps and curves

the integrable hierarchy suggests a concept of  -function for curves and conformal maps.
the  -function solves the problem of moments, i.e., restoration of the moments of the
interior vk out of the moments of the exterior {tk} and the area t. we dene the  -
function  (t; {ti}, {ti}) as a real function, which determines the moments of the exterior
by the formulas

vk =

vk =

(5.1)

 log 

tk

 log

the very existence of the  -function is due to the fundamental symmetry of harmonic

moments:

vj

v0
tk

vk
t

(5.2)

which we prove below. the proof follows the lines of ref. [3]. to prove the rst symmetry
relation, we notice from (4.4) that tj vk is the constant (z0) part of the laurent series
zk+1zhj in z, i.e., the residue res(zkdhj). then, using the well known property of
residues, we nd that this is equal to the constant part (w0) of the laurent series zkwwhj
in w. then, using the equation (4.7) we get:

vj

((zk)w


w

(zj)+)0 = ((zj)+w


w

(zk))0 = ((zj)w


w

(zk)+)0 =

vk
tj

this chain of equalities is due to the identity (fwwg+)0 = (g+wwf)0 = (gwwf+)0
for residues of laurent series. the proof of the other two symmetry relations is similar.

the  -function determines the hamiltonians as functions of z. eq. (4.4) reads

and the inverse conformal map w(z) (see (1.6) in the introduction).

the  -function itself obeys the dispersionless limit of the hirota equation (a leading

this is an innite set of relations between the second derivatives vnm = tntmlog,

in powers of z and . supplemented by proper initial data, satisfying the unitarity con-
dition, these equations formally solve the local problem of moments, i.e., reconstruction
of the laurent expansion of the s(). the proof of (5.3) is similar to the one known in
the context of the kp hierarchy [8]: multiply the series for the inverse conformal map
w(z) by  kzk1(w), take the polynomial part in w and sum over k.

6 conformal maps as a reduction of the dispersion-

less toda lattice hierarchy

the reader familiar with integrable hierarchies of non-linear dierential equations is able
to identify the dynamical system for conformal maps (4.5,4.6) with the dispersionless limit
of the toda lattice hierarchy [2, 3]. the latter is related with the whitham hierarchy - the
theory of solitons with distinct fast and slow variables. the whitham hierarchy appears
after averaging over fast variables (see [2, 12] and references therein). the dispersionless
limit emerges as the genus-zero whitham hierarchy. formally, it is a semiclassical limit
h  0 of pseudo-dierential (or dierence) operators. for the lax operator of the 2d
toda lattice,

uj(t)ejh 

l = r(t)eh 

t

t +

xj=0
one should replace the dierence operator eh 
t by the canonical variable w with the
poisson bracket {logw, t} = 1. the lax operator then becomes the lax function l(w)
given by a formal laurent series in w. the lax function is identied with the conformal
map z(w) (1.5). the derivatives of the z(w) with respect to the times tk are given
by (4.5) which is nothing else than the dispersionless limit of the lax-sato equation
h/tjl = [hj, l], where hj = (lj)+ + 1
2(lj)0. (the coecient 1/2 is due to a particular
choice of gauge in (6.1), where the coecient in front of the rst term is not xed to be

1.) the mathematical theory of the dispersionless hierarchies constrained by the string
equations has been developed in refs. [2, 9] and extended to the toda hierarchy in ref. [3].
for a comprehensive review see, e.g., [12].

in the toda theory, there are two sets of independent times, ti and ti, and two sets
of potentials, uj and uj. the identication with conformal maps requires them to be
complex conjugate: ti = ti,
uj = uj and the function r to be real. under the reality
conditions the semiclassical limit of the second lax operator,

l = r(th)eh 

t +

uj(t)ejh

(6.2)

is identied with z(w1). the reality condition is consistent with the 2d toda hierarchy
and selects a class of solutions relevant to conformal maps.

this class is reduced to a unique solution by imposing the string equation {z, z} = 1,
which in the dispersionful case would be [l, l] = h. to clarify the origin of the string
equation, one needs two more operators. these are the orlov-shulman operators [11]

analytic curves and dispersionless hierarchies. thus one particular solution of the dis-
persionless 2d toda hierarchy describes evolution of the univalent conformal map of a
domain bounded by an analytic curve to the exterior of the unit circle. the set of times
of the hierarchy appears to be equivalent to the set of harmonic moments of the domain,
whereas the conformal map itself is the dispersionless limit of the lax operator.

this proposition can be reversed: conformal maps of the exterior of the unit circle
generate a solution of the dispersionless toda hierarchy. the solution is selected by the
string equation (3.1).

other solutions of the dispersionless toda hierarchy are selected by more general
string equations. the latter are characterized by any two functions f and g forming
a canonical pair: {f, g} = f . then the general string equations consistent with the
hierarchy are l = f 1(l, m), m = g(l, m) (see [3]). we expect that some of them are
also relevant to the conformal maps of simply connected domains. it is likely that other
types of string equations describe mappings to or from domains other then the exterior
of the unit circle and also nonunivalent maps.

moreover, we expect that other integrable hierarchies of the hydrodynamic type, for
instance kp hierarchy and its reductions, also describe certain classes of conformal maps
and curves others than analytic. we plan to address this question elsewhere.

the  -function for curves. all this suggests to introduce a general notion of the  -
function for curves. for smooth curves, this is a universal function which determines the
curve by means of the laurent series

the dispersionless hirota equation (5.3) provides a set of dierential equations for the  -
function. again, it has many solutions. the proper solution is selected by the unitarity
condition (2.7) and initial data. for instance, if the curve can be reached by small
deformations of a circle, one sets tk log = 0 at all tk = 0.

moving curves and the c = 1 string theory. there is another intriguing relation
(in fact equivalence) between deformations of analytic curves and the genus-0 topological
sector of 2d gravity coupled to c = 1 matter [4]. this follows from the known equivalence
between the latter and the dispersionless toda hierarchy restricted by the so-called w1+-
constraints [4, 2, 12]. the interpretation of the objects of the genus-0 string theory in
terms of analytic curves is straightforward. the positive (negative) momentum tachyon
one-point functions < tn > are moments of the interior of the domain vn (vn), the
partition function of the genus-0 string is the  -function of analytic curves, the schwarz
function s(z) is the superpotential and, nally, the w1+-constraints are essentially
equivalent to the string equation (3.1) or the relation (4.11). in fact, they are nothing
else than the unitarity condition (2.7).

in its turn, the c = 1 genus-0 string theory, as well as the relevant solution to the
dispersionless hierarchy, is known to be equivalent to the planar limit of the two-matrix
model (see [5] and references therein). this gives a representation of the  -function of

analytic curves as n   limit of the n n two-matrix integral  = r dmd m exp trw ,
with the potential w = pk(tkm k + tk m k) + m m . we plan to discuss this subject

elsewhere.

the interpretation of the genus-0 string theory as a simply minded classical theory of
potential may turned out to be fruitful for both subjects. it is likely that the 2d gravity

laplacian growth problem. this paper has been stimulated by our interest in the
laplacian growth problem (see [13] for a review). this problem (a source of interest-
ing mathematics and a great deal of important application) may give further insights in
the matters we discuss in the paper. it seems to be the place for a short introduction.
this is the problem of a moving interface between two incompressible liquids with dif-
ferent viscosities on the plane. let, say an exterior of a simply connected domain be
occupied by a viscous uid (oil), while less viscous liquid (water) occupies the interior.
water is supplied by a source at z = 0, while oil sinks to a source at the innity, so the
interface moves. experiments and numerical simulations suggest that any smooth inter-
face, regardless of its initial shape, develops a nger-like pattern with a universal fractal
characteristics. the hydrodynamics of an ideal interface (with zero surface tension) is

11

described by the darcy law

vn = 

p
n

(7.2)

where vn is the velocity of the interface and p/n is the normal derivative of the pressure
on the interface. the pressure is constant in the water domain and on the interface, while
in the oil domain it obeys the laplace equation 2p = 0 with the asymptotic behavior
at the innity p  1/2 log |z|. the latter indicates a sink at the innity. the darcy
law implies [14] that all harmonic moments tk of the oil domain are not changed while
the interface moves, but the area of the water domain grows linearly in time and thus
can be identied with the time. (for connections with the inverse potential problem see
[15].) the problem then becomes: nd the evolution of the domain as a function of the
area t at xed moments tk. this evolution is described by the string equation (3.1).
this equation has a long history. it appeared in 1945 in ref. [16] or even earlier in the
mathematical theory of oil hydrodynamics. in our approach, this equation is the basis
of the symplectic structure of the conformal maps. application of integrable hierarhies
to the laplacian growth problem is addressed in ref.[17]

during the completion of the manuscript e.ferapontov informed us that j.gibbons
and s.tsarev discussed a relation between benney equations and conformal maps of slit
domains [18]. we would like to thank j.gibbons and s.tsarev for informing us about
their recent paper [19].

appendix: ellipse growing from a circle

here we demonstrate how the lax-sato equations describe an ellipse growing from a
circle. it is the simplest but nevertheless instructive example which in particular allows
one to compute the  -function at all tk = 0 but t, t1, t1, t2, t2. consider an ellipse with

12

half-axes a, b centered at z0 = x0 + iy0 and rotated by the angle :

(cos (x  x0)  sin (y  y0))2

a2

+

(sin (x  x0) + cos (y  y0))2

b2

= 1

the schwarz function of the ellipse is

s(z) = e2i a2 + b2

a2  b2 (z  z0) + z0 

2abe2i

a2  b2q(z  z0)2  e2i(a2  b2)

the laurent series of the schwarz function (2.5)

s(z) = 2t2z + t1 +

t
z

+

v1
z2 +

v2
z3 + . . .

gives the moments of the exterior and the interior. the only nonzero moments of the
exterior are t1, t2 and their complex conjugate:

2t2 = e2i a  b
a + b

,

t1 = z0  2t2z0,

t = ab

contrary, none of moments of the interior vanish. the rst two are

v1 =

t(t1 + 2t1t2)

1  4t2t2

,

v2 =

t(t1 + 2t1t2)2
(1  4t2t2)2 +

2t2t2

1  4t2t2

adding tv0 = 2 log r, one may check the symmetry relations (5.2) and nd the  -function
for the ellipse:

log =

1
2

t2logt 

3
4

t2 

1
2

t2log (1  4t2t2) + t

t1t1 + t2
1

t2 + t2

1t2

1  4t2t2

the laurent series for the conformal map from the exterior of the unit circle to the

exterior of the ellipse is truncated:

z(w) = rw + u0 + u1w1 ,

the coecients of the conformal map are:

r2 =

1
4

(a + b)2 =

t

1  4t2t2

,

u2
1 =

1
4

e4i(a  b)2 =

4tt2
2

1  4t2t2

u0 = z0 =

t1 + 2t1t2
1  4t2t2
2u0 , h2 = r2w2 + 2ru0w + ru1 + 1

the rst two hamiltonians are: h1 = rw + 1
0. higher
ows deform the ellipse. the lax-sato equations plus the string equation (3.1) and their
conjugate describe how the ellipse grows from the circle.
