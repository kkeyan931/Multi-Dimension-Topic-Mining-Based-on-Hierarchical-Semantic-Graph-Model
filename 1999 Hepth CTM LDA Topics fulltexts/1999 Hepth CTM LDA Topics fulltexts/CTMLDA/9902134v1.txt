abstract

we study n = (2, 2) supersymmetric abelian gauge theories in two dimensions. the exact bps
spectrum of these models is shown to coincide with the spectrum of massive hypermultiplets of
certain n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions. a special case of these results
involves a surprising connection between four-dimensional n = 2 sqcd with n colours and
nf > n avours at the root of the baryonic higgs branch and the supersymmetric cp 2n nf 1
-model in two dimensions. this correspondence implies a new prediction for the strong-
coupling spectrum of the four-dimensional theory.

1 introduction

it has been noted many times in the past that two-dimensional theories with n = (2, 2) super-
symmetry have intriguing similarities to supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions. in
this paper we will describe a quantitative correspondence between n = (2, 2) theories in two
dimensions and certain gauge theories with n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions which
suggests new results for both types of model. in the present context, the key feature shared by
these models is the existence of bps states. the specic theories we will consider are,

theory a: two-dimensional n = (2, 2) supersymmetric u(1)g gauge theory with dimen-
sionful gauge coupling e. the matter content consists of n chiral multiplets with charge +1
under u(1)g and twisted masses m1, . . . , mn [1]. a further n < n chiral multiplets have
charge 1 and twisted masses m1, . . . , m n . the classical theory has a dimensionless fayet-
iliopoulis (fi) parameter r and vacuum angle  which are combined in a single complex coupling
 = ir + /2. in the quantum theory,  is eliminated in favour of a dynamical scale, .

theory b: four-dimensional n = 2 su(n) sqcd with nf = n + n fundamental hy-
permultiplets with masses m1, . . . , mn and m1, . . . , m n . the vacuum expectation value of the
vector multiplet scalar is taken such that the theory lies at the root of its rst baryonic higgs
branch. the dimensionless gauge coupling g and vacuum angle  combine to form the complex
coupling  = 4i/g2 +/2 which is a parameter of the classical theory. in the quantum theory,
 is eliminated in favour of a dynamical scale, .

the main result presented below is that the bps spectrum of theory a is identical to
the spectrum of massive bps-saturated hypermultiplets of theory b. by this we mean that
the masses of corresponding bps multiplets in each theory are identical as functions of the
parameters1 mi, mi and . a simplied version of the same correspondence also holds at the
classical level with dependence on  replaced by dependence on  . similar results for the special
case n = 0 were presented in [2]. in this paper we extend the correspondence to the general
case described above and investigate the consequences for the strong-coupling spectrum of the
four-dimensional theory. we also discuss the correspondence of the bps states in terms of the
intersecting brane conguration introduced in [1] and its counterpart for the four-dimensional
theory [3].

the rst step in demonstrating the claimed correspondence is to show that the central

1as explained below and in [2] the bps spectrum of theory a does not depend on the two-dimensional

gauge coupling e.

charges of both theories are identical as functions of the parameters. the central charge of the
four-dimensional model is governed by the periods of an elliptic curve which is given explicitly
in [4]. in contrast, the two-dimensional central charge is determined by the critical values of
a twisted superpotential. a key property of the two-dimensional bps spectrum is its stability
against d-term perturbations including, in particular, variation of the gauge coupling e [5, 6].
because of this property, the exact twisted superpotential of theory a and therefore its exact
central charge can be determined by a one-loop calculation performed at weak coupling. we
nd that the central charge of both models is given by the same holomorphic function of mi,
mi and .

to check that the bps spectra of the two theories agree, it is also necessary to specify which
bps states occur in each model. if we choose the parameters mi so that a sucient number
of gauge bosons have masses much greater than ||, the four-dimensional theory is weakly
coupled. in this case, the bps spectrum, which can be determined by semiclassical methods,
includes quarks, monopoles and dyons which are n = 2 hypermultiplets in addition to the
gauge bosons which lie in n = 2 gauge multiplets. we also nd a characteristic spectrum of
quark-monopole boundstates which have not been described before. in fact it is easy to show
that theory a, which is also weakly-coupled in this region of parameter space, contains bps
states corresponding to each massive quark, monopole and dyon hypermultiplet of theory b,
as well as counterparts of each of the quark-monopole boundstates mentioned above.

away from weak-coupling, the problem of determining which bps states occur in the spec-
trum is complicated by the presence of curves of marginal stability on which bps states may
decay. for n = 2 theories in four dimensions, this problem has only been solved for gauge
group su(2) [7]. however, in the two dimensional case, we can make some progress by not-
ing that theory a eectively reduces to the supersymmetric cp n  n 1 -model at the special
point in the strong-coupling region of parameter space where all twisted masses vanish2. this
model is integrable and its exact spectrum is well known [8, 9, 6]. the -model has an un-
broken su(n  n ) global symmetry and the bps states form multiplets of this symmetry.
in addition to kinks transforming in the fundamental representation, there is a characteristic
spectrum of boundstates transforming in antisymmetric tensor representations of su(n  n).
small twisted masses break the global symmetry and introduce mass splittings for these mul-
tiplets which are exactly determined by the one-loop twisted superpotential described above.
as the point mi = mi = 0 is not singular, this description of the spectrum should be valid in
some open region of the parameter space containing this point. this strong coupling spectrum
of kinks and their boundstates is obviously quite dierent from the weak coupling spectrum
2as explained in section 3 below, if n 6= 0 theory a also has a massless spectrum and it is necessary to

introduce certain additional complex mass parameters to reduce the theory to the -model in question.

described above. for example the former spectrum contains only a nite number of bps states
while the latter is innite. as usual these dierences can be resolved by the presence of curves
of marginal stability which disconnect the parameter space into inequivalent regions.

as the exact central charges of theory a and theory b are identical, the same curves of
marginal stability occur in both theories. combining this with the fact that the spectra of the
two theories already agree at weak coupling, it seems very plausible that the correspondence
should hold throughout the parameter space. indeed in the n = 2 case, where four-dimensional
results are available, this agreement can be checked explicitly [2]. to strengthen this conclusion
in the general case, we review the realization of theory a [1] and theory b [3], on the world-
volumes of intersecting m-theory branes. in either theory, bps states appear as m2 branes
whose boundaries lie on m5-branes. in both cases, the relevant boundaries naturally correspond
to one-cycles on the same riemann surface.

the equivalence of two-dimensional and four-dimensional spectra considered here has in-
teresting consequences for both theories. as in [2], we learn that the two-dimensional theory
displays many of the phenomena which are characteristic of n = 2 theories in four-dimensions.
these include non-trivial monodromies of the spectrum in the complex parameter space, curves
of marginal stability as well as strong-coupling vacua with massless solitons. conversely, setting
all twisted masses to zero we uncover an unexpected relation between four-dimensional su(n)
n = 2 sqcd with nf = n + n massless avours at the baryonic root and the cp n  n1
-model in two dimensions. both models are asymptotically free and have a u(1) r-symmetry
which is broken to a z2n 2 n subgroup by instantons3. the global su(n  n) symmetry of
the -model is identied with the unbroken global symmetry on the baryonic branch of the
four-dimensional theory. the correspondence described above then makes a prediction for the
four-dimensional bps spectrum at the baryonic root. in addition to the massless spectrum
at the baryonic root which was described in [4], we should nd massive bps hypermultiplets
transforming in the fundamental representation of the global su(n  n) symmetry as well
as boundstates in each anti-symmetric tensor representation of this group. interestingly, an
explicit semiclassical shows that these states are also present in the weak-coupling regime of
the same four-dimensional theory4.

the plan of the paper is as follows.

in section 2 we discuss various classical aspects of
the two dimensional theory including a description of the twisted masses, the moduli space

3 note that the correspondence discussed here is quite distinct from the more conventional analogy between
the supersymmetric cp n 1 -model in two dimensions and n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with
gauge group su (n ) in four dimensions

root to the region where the adjoint vevs are much larger than ||

of classical vacua, the central charge and the spectrum of elementary quanta and solitons. in
order to describe the latter in a manifestly supersymmetric manner, it is necessary to work in a
dual landau-ginzburg formalism of the theory which we describe. in section 3, we turn to the
quantum aspects of theory a and determine the exact central charge and, in certain regimes
of the parameter space, the bps spectrum. in section 4, we show that the central charge of
theory a does indeed coincide with that of theory b. we further describe the four-dimensional
massive hypermultiplet spectrum in the weak-coupling regime and show that it agrees with the
two-dimensional spectrum. finally, in section 5, we consider the iia/m-brane description of
the two theories.

2 theory a: classical analysis

two-dimensional gauge theories with n = (2, 2) supersymmetry were studied in detail by
witten in [10] and an extensive introduction to these theories, including the n = (2, 2) super-
space formalism used below, can be found in this reference. additional relevant background
material is given in [1, 2]. the conventions used are those of [2]. the two-dimensional gauge
theory described in the introduction is built from a vector supereld v , n chiral superelds
i, i = 1, . . . , n, with charge +1 under the gauge group u(1)g, and n chiral superelds i,
i = 1, . . . , n, with charge 1. the gauge eld kinetic terms are written most simply in terms
of a gauge-invariant twisted chiral supereld,  = d
+dv , whose lowest component is a com-
plex scalar  and also includes the u(1) eld strength as well as fermionic superpartners.  is
referred to as the eld-strength supereld of the corresponding gauge multiplet v . each chiral
multiplet i ( i) consists of a complex scalar, i ( i), and a single dirac fermion.

the kinetic terms for all elds are contained in an n = (2, 2) d-term,

where e is the dimensionful gauge coupling constant. two dimensionless parameters will also
prove important in the story: the fayet-iliopoulis (fi) parameter, r, and the vacuum angle, .
these are simply incorporated in the supereld formalism via the twisted f-term [10],

lf i =

where  = ir + /2 and d2 is the measure over the twisted half of superspace. both
the d- and f-terms above are invariant under the full u(1)a  u(1)r automorphism group

of the n = (2, 2) supersymmetry algebra. the theory also has a global avour symmetry
h = u(n)  u( n )/u(1)g.

gauge theories with n = (2, 2) supersymmetry admit two dierent types of supersym-
metric mass parameters for chiral multiplets. the rst arises by dimensional reduction of the
corresponding 4d mass term and has the form of an ordinary superpotential (as opposed to a
twisted superpotential),

l m =z d2 miji j + h.c.

(2.2)

following [1] we refer to the parameters mij as complex masses. generic non-zero complex
masses break u(1)r and also completely break the global symmetry group h. the r-symmetry
u(1)a is left unbroken. the second kind of mass parameter, known as a twisted mass, has no
counterpart in four dimensions. twisted masses are introduced by weakly gauging the global
avour symmetry h of the model and constraining the lowest component of the corresponding
eld-strength multiplet to a xed background expectation value. in fact, in order to preserve
supersymmetry this expectation value must be diagonalisable and we will only gauge the cartan

u (1)i(cid:17) /u(1)g, where
subalgebra c of the avour group h. we have c =(cid:0)n
u(1)i is dened so that the chiral multiplet j has charge +ij while the j are neutral.
similarly, under u (1)i, the j are neutral while the j carry charge ij. modding out by
u(1)g is necessary because because the sum of the generators of the global u(1) subgroups
dened above generates the original gauge group.

i=1u(1)i(cid:1)(cid:16) n

the vector multiplets corresponding to the newly gauged u(1)s are denoted as vi, i =

1, . . . , n and vi, i = 1, . . . , n and the d-term lagrangian for the kinetic terms becomes

as each of their component elds is to be constrained, a kinetic term for the new gauge elds
would be redundant. instead we introduce a twisted chiral multiplet, i (i), for each new
gauge multiplet, vi ( vi), adding to the lagrangian the term,

where i ( i) is the eld strength supereld for vi ( vi). these twisted chiral superelds act
as lagrange multipliers for the constraints i = mi and i = mi. they also constrain the
corresponding gauge elds to be pure gauge. since these eld strengths are themselves twisted

5

chiral superelds, mi and mi are referred to as twisted masses.
in addition to breaking h
down to its cartan subalgebra, generic non-zero twisted masses also break u(1)a. the residual
r-symmetry group in the presence of twisted masses is u(1)r. note that the above procedure
for introducing twisted masses only makes sense if the subgroup of the global symmetry group
which we are gauging is unbroken. for this reason, if the chiral eld i appears in a complex
mass term such as (2.2), it cannot also have a non-zero twisted mass5. in this paper we will
be primarily interested in the theory with non-zero twisted masses and complex masses are
henceforth set to zero unless stated otherwise. the superspace lagrangian for the model of
interest is therefore l = lk +lf i +llm . note also that the sum of all twisted masses may be
changed by a shift in  and we use this freedom to set pn
i=1 mi = 0 while leaving the masses
an alternative expression for this lagrangian which will prove useful below is l = ld +lf

mi unconstrained.

with i = exp(xi) and i = exp( xi). in the above expression we have also redened the gauge
superelds as ui = v + vi and ui = v + vi and split the lagrange multiplier superelds into
real and imaginary parts according to,

i = iri +

(2.6)

notice that each gauge eld ui ( ui) has fayet-iliopoulis term where the fi coupling is the
imaginary part, ri ( ri), of the twisted chiral supereld i (i). note also that we have chosen
to write these terms in the conventional way as d-terms depending on the vector superelds ui
( ui) rather than as twisted f-terms analogous to (2.1) above which involve the corresponding
eld-strength superelds. the residual twisted f-terms are conveniently written in terms of a
twisted superpotential as

5more precisely the twisted masses of the two chiral superelds appearing in (2.2) are not independent

parameters but obey a certain linear constraint.

at this point we have a model which contains both chiral and twisted chiral superelds.
these two kinds of supereld have exactly the same content in terms of component elds and
it is sometimes possible to eliminate a chiral supereld in favour of a twisted chiral supereld
(or vice versa) using the two-dimensional duality transformation introduced by rocek and
verlinde [11]. in the following we will use this transformation to derive a dual formulation in
which the lagrangian has a simple landau-ginzburg form. this is particularly straightforward
for the present model as the rst step in the duality transformation of [11] is to gauge a single
global symmetry generator for each chiral supereld exactly as we have done above. further in
the usual duality transformation one must also introduce a lagrange multiplier to enforce the
constraint that the new gauge elds are pure gauge. this step also has already been performed
above in the process of introducing twisted masses. the fact that the scalar components of
these gauge multiplets are constrained to a non-zero value in the present case means this is a
slight generalization of the usual duality transformation.

to complete the duality transformation requires two more steps. first the chiral multiplets

xi and xi are absorbed by the gauge transformation,

(2.9)

second we can eliminate the gauge multiplets ui and ui via their equations of motion which
read,

exp(2ui) = ri

exp(2 ui) =  ri

(2.10)

the result is a dual description of the theory in terms of the chiral superelds i, i and 
with lagrangian of landau-ginzburg form. we have l = ld + lf with,

ld =z d4 k[i,

(2.12)

the twisted f-term lagrangian lf is dened in (2.7,2.8) above. this dual formulation of the
model will be particularly useful when discussing the properties of bps solitons below. a limit
of the theory which will be of particular interest below is the strong-coupling limit e  . in
this limit the kinetic terms for the gauge multiplet can be omitted from the kahler potential

the manifold of classical supersymmetric vacua, determined by the condition u = 0, depends
on the parameters r, mi and mi. we begin by considering the case of zero twisted masses,
mi = mi = 0. in this case the theory has a classical higgs branch with  = 0, determined by
solving the equation,

(2.15)

modulo u(1) gauge transformations. the quotient of the solution space of (2.15) by u(1)g
denes a toric variety, mh(r), of complex dimension n + n  1 [10, 12]. the generators of
the global symmetry group h act as isometries on mh. for r > 0 (r < 0) mh has kahler
class r (r) and rst chern class c1 = n  n ( n  n). the two regions r < 0 and r > 0 are
separated by the point r = 0 at which the classical higgs branch is singular. a special case
is n = n, where the two regions yield a pair of birationally equivalent calabi-yau manifolds
[10]. the classical higgs branch is always non-compact except in the two cases, n = 0 with
r > 0, and, n = 0 with r < 0, where the toric varieties in question are the complex projective
spaces cp n 1 and cp n 1. another special feature of the cases with n = 0 ( n = 0), is
that the classical theory has no supersymmetric vacua at all if r is negative (positive). as we
will see below, this and several other features of the classical theories are modied by quantum
corrections. for r = 0 only, the classical theory also has a coulomb branch on which i = i = 0
and  is unconstrained.

when generic non-zero twisted masses are introduced the classical higgs branch is lifted
leaving only a nite number of isolated supersymmetric vacua. in particular, for r > 0, we
nd n such vacua, vi with i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
in the vacuum vj the scalar elds take values
 = mj, i = rij and i = 0. correspondingly, for r < 0 we nd n supersymmetric vacua,

8

vi with i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
in the vacuum vj the scalar elds take values  =  mj, i = 0,
and i = rij. in each of these vacua the scalar component of a single chiral multiplet is

non-zero and the phase of this eld has been set to zero by a u(1)g gauge rotation. when two
or more twisted masses coincide a continuous vacuum degeneracy is restored. if r > 0, the two
minimal cases occur when mi = mj for some i and j and when mi = mj for some i and j. both
cases give rise to higgs branches of complex dimension one. in the rst case the higgs branch
is a copy of cp 1 while in the second case it is a non-compact complex manifold which satises
the calabi-yau condition c1 = 0. in contrast, the condition mi = mj for some i and j does not
increase the vacuum degeneracy (for r > 0). as in the massless case, the theory with r = 0 also
has a coulomb branch on which all the chiral multiplet scalars vanish and  is unconstrained.

we will now consider the bps spectrum of the classical theory introduced above beginning
with the case of vanishing twisted masses. in this case the full r-symmetry group u(1)au(1)r
is unbroken. this implies that the n = (2, 2) susy algebra has vanishing central charge and
thus there are no massive bps states in the classical theory. however, the classical theory does
have massless particles corresponding to the at directions of the higgs and coulomb branches
described above. in particular there are n + n  1 massless chiral multiplets which correspond
to complex coordinates on the classical higgs branch mh(r). in any open region of mh in
which j 6= 0, the gauge-invariant superelds w (j)
i = i/j, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n with i 6= j,
together with w (j)
i = j i, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, provide a convenient basis for these massless
elds. in the classical theory the scalar components of some of these multiplets are goldstone
bosons for the broken generators of the global symmetry group h, a situation which cannot
persist in the corresponding two-dimensional quantum theory [13]. in contrast, uctuations of

the elds which are orthogonal to the vacuum manifold get masses of order e|r| from the higgs
mechanism. provided r 6= 0, the massive elds decouple in the infra-red (ir) limit e  
and the resulting theory is precisely a supersymmetric non-linear -model with target manifold
mh(r). the coupling constant of the low-energy -model is related to the fi parameter as
g =p2/r.
in the presence of twisted masses, the same ir limit yields a massive deformation of the
-model which was studied in detail for the case n = 0 where mh = cp n 1 in [2].
in
the deformed model, the classical vacuum degeneracy is lifted as described above and each
of the n + n  1 massless chiral multiplets of the -model acquires a mass. as usual, the
conversion of massless degrees of freedom to massive is only consistent if the latter states
are bps saturated and therefore lie in short multiplets of supersymmetry. this is possible
due to the fact that twisted masses break u(1)a allowing a non-zero central charge in the
supersymmetry algebra. further the twisted masses also break h to its maximal torus and
the unbroken cartan generators are natural candidates for the central charges in question [1].

9

and w (j)

massive particles which carry the global u(1) charges can then form short multiplets. in the
vacuum vj, the n + n  1 massless chiral multiplets w (j)
dened above get masses
|mi  mj| and | mi  mj| respectively. summing over each of the vacua vi of the r > 0 theory,
we nd a total of n(n + n  1) states with distinct masses. introducing a little new notation
allows these masses to be written in a simple universal form. we denote the charge carried by
a eld under the global u(1)k ( u (1)k) avour symmetries as sk ( sk) note that w (j)
i = i/j
then carries charges sk = ik  jk and sk = 0, while the eld w (j)
i = ij carries charges
sk = jk and sk = ik. the masses of all these states obey the bps mass formula m = |zs|
where the corresponding central charge is,

(2.16)

the bps states described above are elementary quanta of the elds appearing in the la-
grangian of the mass-deformed -model. as the classical theory with non-zero twisted masses
has isolated supersymmetric vacua, an additional possibility arises: there can be bps satu-
rated kinks which interpolate between distinct supersymmetric vacua at left and right spatial
innity. for r > 0, we can dene topological charges ti, i = 1, . . . , n, such that a eld con-
guration that tends asymptotically to the vacuum vj as x   and to vk as x   has
topological charge ti = ij  ik. correspondingly, for r < 0, we dene topological charges,
ti, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, associated with solitons which interpolate between the vacua vi. like
the global generators si and si dened above, the topological charges ti and ti, can also con-
tribute to the central charge [14]. solitons with non-zero topological charges can then give rise
to additional bps states in the spectrum. as we review below, the topological contribution to
the classical central charge (2.16) is included by the replacement si  si +  ti in (2.16) for
r > 0 and si  si +  ti for r < 0.

for the case of the mass-deformed cp n 1 -model, bps saturated kinks were studied in
detail in [2]. we will begin by briey reviewing the simplest example, n = 2, n = 0, where
the target space is cp 1. in this case there are two classical vacua v1 and v2, with a single
chiral multiplet of mass |m| = |m1  m2| in each. the scalar components of these multiplets
are w = 1/2 in v1 and 1/w in v2. the theory has a single global u(1) charge s = (s1 s2)/2
and a single topological charge t = (t1 t2)/2. it will be useful to exhibit the soliton solutions
in both versions of the model introduced above. starting from the original formulation of the
theory, with lagrangian l = lk + lf i + llm dened in (2.1,2.3,2.4), we take the ir limit
e   and eliminate the gauge eld multiplet by its equations of motion. we then obtain
it is convenient to
a lagrangian for the complex scalar w = 1/2 and its superpartner.

this is a variant of the sine-gordon (sg) lagrangian with an additional massless eld  which
has derivative couplings to the sg eld . the two susy vacua found above correspond to the
two sets of zeros of the sg potential, which occur at  = 2n and at  = (2n + 1) for integer
n. as  appears only through its derivatives it can take any constant value in the vacuum.

the classical equations of motion coming from (2.18), have a family of solutions of topolog-

ical charge t = 1, with  = t and,

 = 2 tan1(cid:16)expp|m|2  2(cid:17)

(2.19)

which are labelled by the real parameter  with || < |m|. the mass and global charge of the
solution are,

m =

r|m|2
p|m|2  2

s =

r

p|m|2  2 


2

(2.20)

applying semiclassical bohr-sommerfeld quantization to these periodic classical solutions we
nd that the allowed values of  are quantized so that s takes only integer values [2]. hence
the theory has an innite tower of dyons which carry both topological charges and noether
charges. the contribution of the vacuum angle  to the global charge is a two-dimensional
analog of the witten eect [15] for dyons in four dimensions. eliminating the variable  we
nd that the soliton mass can be written as

m = |m|s(cid:18)s +



2(cid:19)2

+ r2

(2.21)

from the above we learn that the masses of both the dyons and the elementary quanta are
consistent with the bps mass formula m = |z| where,
z = im (s +  t )

(2.22)

the description of the solitons given above and in [2] has a serious drawback: supersymmetry
is not manifest and properties such as bps saturation of the solutions have to be checked by

11

explicit calculation. in particular, we would like to derive the formula (2.22) for the central
charge directly, rather than guessing it from the mass spectrum as we did above. in fact for a
large class of n = (2, 2) models with lagrangians of landau-ginzburg form, the bogomolnyi
bound can be derived directly in superspace [16]. as we showed above, the two-dimensional
theory with twisted masses can be be put in this standard form by performing a rocek-verlinde
duality transformation. in the case n = 2, n = 0, after imposing the constraint (2.13), the
dual lagrangian can be written in terms of a single twisted chiral supereld, by setting 1 = 
and 2 =   . the resulting lagrangian is

with kahler potential.

l =z d4 k[, ] + z d2w() + z d2  w()

k[] = r (1  logr) + (r  r) (1  log(r  r))

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

where  = ir + /2. in the following, , r and  will denote either the supereld or its
scalar component depending on context. the kahler metric is,

g  = 

2k
 =

r

4r(r  r)

and the twisted superpotential w has the simple form w = im/2. the lagrangian (2.23)
is in fact the most general lagrangian for a single twisted chiral supereld with at most two
derivatives and we will meet it again with dierent choices for k and w in the next section.
for this reason we will now give a general derivation of the bogomolnyi bound at the same
time as giving the specic formulae which relate to the present choice of k and w.

after integrating out auxiliary elds the bosonic part of the above lagrangian becomes,

lbose = g   g  w
4r(r  r)(cid:20)(r)2 +

= 



r

 w

42 ()2(cid:21)  |m|2

r r(r  r)

(2.26)

where g  = 1/g . we can immediately compare this with the lagrangian (2.18) for the
bosonic elds  and  and deduce the identications,

r = r sin2 

2

 = r sin2 

(2.27)

the second equality states that the scalar eld strengths  and  are related by a two-
dimensional analog of electric-magnetic duality which interchanges equations of motion and
bianchi identities [11]. the bosonic potential,
 w
 = |m|2

u = g  w


r r(r  r)

(2.28)

12

has zeros at r = 0 and r = r corresponding to the two supersymmetric vacua of the model.
the eld  can take any constant value in the vacuum as it only its derivatives appear in
the lagrangian. note that the zeros of u come from poles in the kahler metric g  rather
than zeros of w/ which is more conventional. this does not indicate any pathology of the
underlying model but rather reects our choice of coordinates in eld space.

we will now consider solitons which interpolate between between distinct vacua at left and
right spatial innity. specically we consider boundary conditions,   0 as x   and
  + = ir + /2 as x  +. the mass of such a conguration obeys the following
inequality [16] which hold for any complex constant  with || = 1,

by choosing  = w/|w| with w = w(+)  w(0) we obtain the bogomolnyi bound
m  2|w|. this corresponds to a non-zero value for the central charge z = 2w = im =
mr + im/2.

to interpret this formula recall that in the (, ) variables we found time-dependent solutions
(2.19) with  = t. the identication (2.27) implies that time-dependence of  translates to
x dependence for . an explicit comparison of soliton solutions in the two sets of variables
(, ) and (r, ) is performed in appendix a, where it is shown that the time-dependent
dyon solutions (2.19) in the rst set of variables correspond to static bps congurations which
saturate the bound (2.29) in the second. in particular the relevant boundary conditions for 
are related to the global u(1) charge s as  =  + 2s. the resulting bps mass formula is
m = |z| with central charge z = 2w = im(s +  ) which agrees with (2.22) in the sector
of topological charge t = 1. note that the fact that s is quantized in integer units, which is
derived from the bohr-sommerfeld quantization condition in the (, ) variables, is not at all
obvious in the (r, ) variables. the two descriptions are analogous to the two dierent choices
of gauge, due to tomboulis and woo (tw) [17] and to julia and zee (jz) [18] respectively,
used to describe bps dyon solutions in four-dimensions. in the tw gauge the dyon solution
has periodic time-dependence, while in the jz gauge it is static. similarly, the quantization of
electric charge is obvious in the rst gauge but not in the second.

as emphasised above and in [2], the bps spectrum of the mass-deformed supersymmetric
cp 1 -model has strong similarities to that of a gauge theory with extended supersymmetry

13

in four-dimensions. this correspondence becomes particularly clear in the (r, ) variables
introduced above. to exhibit this connection it is useful to recall another general property of
n = (2, 2) solitons in theories of landau-ginzburg type. as shown in [6], the soliton always
follows a particular trajectory in eld space: a straight line in the complex w plane which
joins two vacua. in the present case we have w = im/2, so this is equivalent to a straight
line-segment in the complex -plane. this is demonstrated explicitly in appendix a. the mass
of the resulting bps state is proportional to the length of this line-segment. as above we set
 = ir+/2 and note that vacua occur on the two lines r = 0 and r = r. further, it follows
from the discussion above that the vacuum values of  are also quantized in units of of 2s.
they can be chosen to lie at  = 2n for r = 0 and  = 2n +  for r = r. we now have two
innite rows of vacua in the complex -plane and each bps state, including both elementary
particles and dyons as well as the corresponding charge-conjugate states, is associated with a
line segment joining two vacua. the mass of each state is the length of the line segment. this
is essentially identical to the classical charge lattice of bps states of a four-dimensional n = 2
theory6 with gauge group su(2), where we identify the quantum numbers s and t correspond
to the electric and magnetic charges respectively. interestingly, the bps charge lattice which is
an abstraction in the four-dimensional context, acquires direct physical signicance as a lattice
of vacua in eld space in the two dimensional theory.

we now turn to the bps soliton spectrum for the models with general n and n . some
partial results for arbitrary n and n = 0 were given in [2]. in the general case (with r > 0),
the central charge of the classical theory is given by,

z = zs + zt = i

mi(si +  ti) + i

n

xi=1

mi

si

xi=1

(2.30)

in addition to the spectrum of bps saturated elementary particles described above, there are
bps solitons interpolating between each pair of vacua vl and vk. the (time-independent)
soliton solutions are obtained by a simple embedding of the cp 1 soliton (2.17) and (2.19) by
taking

w(l)
k (x) = exp |ml  mk|x

(2.31)

is the scalar component of the supereld w (l)
k

where w(l)
introduced above. this soliton carries
k
topological charge ti = il  ik. each of these solitons yields an innite tower of dyons
which also carry global charges si = sti with integer s. however, this is not the complete
story since the soliton can also form bound-states with the various fermions in the theory. the
6recall that only bps states of magnetic charge 0,1 occur in su (2) n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills

theory. each of these states corresponds to a vector joining two vacua in the complex  plane.

14

k , the superpartner of w(l)

soliton has an associated fermion (l)
k , which possesses two zero-modes
in the background of the soliton (2.31), this is true even in the cp 1 case [2]. these zero-
modes are associated to fermionic creation operators which create states that ll out the bps
supermultiplet of the soliton. in the cp 1 model this is the complete story; however, for the
more general models there are more fermion elds and the possibility of more bound-states
exists.

(2.32)

where  = arg(m/m). in the above, w = exp |m|x is the soliton solution, with topological
charge ti = il  ik, m = ml  mk and  is one of the fermion elds (l)
, with m equal
to ml  mj and ml  mj, respectively. the equation admits a normalizable solution, namely

j , or (l)

0(cid:19) exp(|m| cos  x)

with energy e = |m| sin , as long as

0 < |m| cos  < |m| ,

i.e.

0 < re(cid:18)m

m(cid:19) < 1

(2.33)

(2.34)

in the standard picture of semi-classical quantization, this normalizable mode is then associated
with a fermion creation and annihilation operator,  and , with the usual anti-commutation
relation {, } = 1. the soliton carries the two-dimensional fock space representation of these
it can exist in the vacuum state |0i, the original soliton, and the bound-state
operators, i.e.
|0i. since the fermion mode carries an energy |m| sin , the bound-state has a dierent mass
than the soliton m = |i m|. however, the bound-state is still a bps state because the fermion
mode contributes to the central charge. the argument goes as follows: the bound-state has
central charge z = i m + im and therefore to be a bps state the mass should be

mb.s. = |i m + m| = |i m| + |m| sin  +   

(2.35)

the rst term is the mass of the soliton and the second is the energy of the fermion mode and
the higher term are suppressed in r1. so to leading order in r1, the bound-state is indeed
a bps state. the corrections in r1 arise from the back-reaction of the fermion eld on the
soliton that we have ignored in our leading-order analysis. at the boundaries of the region
where the fermion mode becomes non-normalizable, the bound-state will decay into a soliton
and a fundamental fermion.

15

we can now build up the following picture of the spectrum of topologically charged bps
states. for a soliton of topological charge ti = il  ik, there is tower of dyon states with
si = sti. in addition, for each state of the tower there are bound-state with fermions:

(1) with (l)
j

in the region

0 < re(cid:18) ml  mj

ml  mk(cid:19) < 1

(2.36)

the bound-state has si = sti + ilij and si = 0. at the boundary re(mlmj/mlmk) = 0
the bound-state decays to the soliton with si = sti and the fundamental fermion with si =
il  ij and si = 0, while at the other boundary re(ml  mj/ml  mk) = 1 the bound-state
decays to the soliton with si = (s + 1)ti and the fundamental fermion with si = ik  ij and
si = 0.

(2) with (l)
j

in the region

0 < re(cid:18) ml  mj

ml  mk(cid:19) < 1

(2.37)

the bound-state has si = sti + il and si = ij. at the boundary re(ml  mj/ml  mk) = 0
the bound state decays to the soliton with si = sti and the fundamental fermion with si = il
and si = ij, while at the other boundary re(ml  mj/ml  mk) = 1 the bound state decays
to the soliton with si = (s + 1)ti and the fundamental fermion with si = ik and si = ij.

in overlapping regions (2.36) and (2.37), for a number of dierent fermions {j1, . . . , jp, j1, . . . , js}

there will be multiple bound-states carrying global charges

si = sti + (p + s)il  ij1      ijp ,

si = ij1      ijs

(2.38)

3 theory a: quantum eects

in this section we consider how the classical bps spectrum of theory a, obtained in the previous
section, is modied by quantum corrections. one particularly important quantum eect, which
arises at one loop, is the logarithmic running of the of the fi parameter. when all twisted
masses are set to zero,

r() = r0 

(n  n )

4

16

u v

log(cid:18)m 2

2 (cid:19)

(3.1)

where r() is the renormalized fi parameter, dened at the scale , and mu v is a uv cut-o.
the bare fi parameter, r0, is equal to the renormalized fi parameter, r(), evaluated at the
cut-o scale  = mu v . in the limit e  , the theory reduces to a supersymmetric -model
with target space mh as described in the previous section. the running coupling of the -
model is related to the fi parameter as g() =p2/r(). we will assume that r0  0 so that

the resulting -model is weakly-coupled at the cuto scale. as usual the running coupling may
be eliminated in favour of an rg invariant scale dened by,

 =  exp(cid:18)

2r()

n  n(cid:19)

(3.2)

the sign of the -model -function depends on the sign of n  n . if n > n then the
theory is asymptotically free and, in the absence of twisted masses, will run to strong coupling
at low energies. this, for example, is the behaviour of the supersymmetric cp n 1 -model.
as explained in [2], this behaviour is modied when non-zero twisted masses are introduced.
the running of the coupling is driven by quantum uctuations of the light chiral multiplets
which appear in the -model lagrangian. all these elds decouple at energy scales below
some scale m which is roughly the twisted mass of the lightest chiral multiplet. the running
coupling is therefore frozen below this energy scale. provided we choose twisted masses such
that |mi mj|   for enough pairs i and j, then the resulting -model will be weakly coupled
at all energies. on the other hand, if n < n , then the -model is ir free. such a theory
may however suer from a landau pole in the uv, and should usually only be considered as a
low-energy eective theory valid below the mass scale  which may be much lower than mu v .
finally, the massless theory with n = n has vanishing beta-function and is therefore scale
invariant. we will henceforth restrict our attention to the asymptotically free case n > n
unless otherwise stated.

another important eect which arises at one-loop is an anomaly which breaks the u(1)a
r-symmetry down to z2n 2 n .
in the absence of twisted masses this means that the bare
-parameter can be set to zero by a u(1)a rotation of the elds. however, even if the bare
parameter is set to zero the theory will still have an eective vacuum angle at low energy. if
the twisted masses are non-zero then the u(1)a symmetry is already explicitly broken to z2
at the classical level. as discussed in [2], the one-loop eects of the running coupling and the
anomaly are equivalent to a holomorphic renormalization of the complex coupling  . in the
cp 1 case described in the previous section this amounts to replacing  by,

when this replacement is combined with the -dependent shift in global u(1) charge of the
dyons described above, it leads to a non-trivial monodromy in the dyon spectrum which is a

close analog of the weak-coupling monodromy of the bps spectrum of an n = 2 theory in four
dimensions.

so far we have only discussed the spectrum in the ir limit e   when the gauge theory
we started with reduces to a non-linear -model. as long as the twisted masses are large and
the -model is weakly coupled, this limit is convenient for determining the bps spectrum.
however for more general values of the twisted masses, the -model becomes strongly coupled
and a new approach is required. a key property of theories with n = (2, 2) supersymmetry
in two dimensions is that the masses of bps states are eectively determined by the f-terms
in the superspace lagrangian. as the two dimensional gauge coupling e only appears in the
gauge multiplet kinetic term, which is a d-term, it follows that the masses of bps states
are actually independent of e. this suggests a completely dierent regime in which we may
attempt to determine the bps spectrum. when e is much less than the other mass scales in
the problem we should be able to determine the bps spectrum using ordinary perturbation
theory. note that perturbation theory in the two-dimensional gauge coupling is quite distinct
from the perturbation theory in the -model coupling used above.

following [10], we consider the eective lagrangian along the coulomb branch i = i = 0
with  unconstrained. as discussed in the previous section, the are no classical susy vacua
on this branch unless r = 0. however, even at weak coupling, this conclusion can be altered
by quantum eects. as long as e is much less than each of the scales | + mi|, | + mi| and ,
we have a theory of a light u(1) gauge multiplet weakly coupled to massive chiral multiplets.
in this case we may integrate out the chiral multiplets and get an eective lagrangian for the
gauge degrees of freedom of the form,

le =z d4 ke[, ] +z d2 we [] +z d2  we[]

here, the complexied coupling constant  is equal to ir() + /2 + n where the integer n is
chosen to minimize the potential energy. as explained in [10], this minimization of the potential
reects the fact that a non-zero value of the  parameter in two-dimensions corresponds to a
constant background electric eld [19]. the states of the system with n 6= n, are unstable
to pair creation of charged particles which screens the background eld leaving the state with
n = n.
in fact there are various arguments which suggest that this is the exact twisted
superpotential [20, 6]. in any case, we will always take e suciently small so that the twisted

18

superpotential is reliable. in general the only points where this eective description may break
down even at small e are the points  = mi and  =  mi where we will nd that extra light
degrees of freedom must be included.

at weak coupling, corrections to the tree level kahler potential ktree = /4e2, are small an
we can safely assume that the metric does not have poles or zeros in the region of eld space
where our approximations are valid. thus the supersymmetric vacua of the theory are in one
to one correspondence with the zeros of w/ and are therefore determined by the complex
equation,

(3.9)

thus there are n supersymmetric vacua located at  = ei for i = 1, . . . , n. as above, we have
assumed that n > n . for |mi  mj|  , these vacua coincide with the n classical vacua vi,
located at the points  = mi, dened in the previous section.

we now consider a bps saturated soliton obeying the boundary conditions,   ek as
x   and   el as x  +. as the eective lagrangian is of the standard landau-
ginzburg form discussed in the previous section we may apply the general bps mass formula
obtained there. thus, the soliton mass is given by mkl = |zkl| where zkl = 2we = 2we(el)
2we(ek). a short calculation reveals that,

for non-zero twisted masses, the branch-cuts in the logarithms appearing in (3.10) lead to an
ambiguity in the bps spectrum. in particular the ambiguity in the central charge is equal to
n
i=1 mini where the choice of integers ni and ni corresponds to a choice of
branch for each of the n + n logarithms in (3.10). as explained by hanany and hori in [1],
this ambiguity signals the fact that solitons can carry integer values of the global u(1) charges
si, si in addition to their topological charges. this is related to the existence of bps dyons
at weak-coupling discussed in the previous sections. including this eect, the nal formula for
the masses of all bps states in the theory is m = |z| with, charge is

for particular values of the twisted masses there are various singular points which can be
compared with the corresponding singular points in the classical theory. for example, in the
previous section we discovered that if two twisted masses mi and mj coincide in the classical
theory, then the chiral multiplets i and j are both massless at  = m1 = m2 giving a
higgs branch which is a copy of cp 1. as the resulting low-energy -model is strongly coupled
in the ir we should expect that quantum eects modify this singularity. as explained in [2], the
classical singular point m = mimj = 0, is split into a pair of singular points at which the vacua
ei and ej coincide. at each of these singular points a single chiral multiplet, corresponding to
the soliton which interpolates between the vacua vi and vj, becomes massless. a single massless
chiral multiplet does not yield a continuous higgs branch and, in particular, does not result in
a massless goldstone boson. thus there is no conict with the usual restrictions on massless
particles in two dimensions [13].

20

in the present case we can also consider what happens if chiral multiplets of opposite charge
become massless. in the classical theory this happens if mi = mj for some i and j. as in the
previous case this gives a higgs branch of complex dimension one at  = mi =  mj. however
the present higgs branch has zero rst chern class and the corresponding low-energy -model
is scale-invariant. in this case we might reasonably expect the higgs branch to remain in the
full quantum theory. the massless theory on the higgs branch could either be a free theory
or, perhaps, a non-trivial cft7. in equation (3.8), which determines the exact location of the
coulomb branch vacua, something interesting happens whenever mi = mj for some i and j:
the numerator and denominator have a common zero and a cancellation occurs. the degree
of the polynomial (3.9) is then lowered by one and it appears that one of the supersymmetric
vacua has disappeared. if this were true it would, certainly contradict standard properties of
the witten index. the resolution is simply that, as in the classical theory, a non-compact higgs
branch appears at  = mi. the eective fi parameter on this branch is determined by the
twisted superpotential,

e =

(3.14)

w

 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=mi

it is also useful to note that, as the two massless chiral multiplets i and j have opposite
charges, we can introduce a complex mass mij by including a superpotential of the form (2.2).
this lifts the higgs branch completely and, in this case, we are left with only n  1 coulomb
branch vacua. this is particularly clear in the iia brane picture described in section 5. a
contradiction with the witten index is avoided because the transition from theory with n
vacua to one with n  1, always goes via the singular point in parameter space where mi = mj,
mij = 0. at this point we have at directions on the higgs branch and the witten index is not
dened.

the masses of topologically non-trivial bps states are patently not single valued as one
tracks their mass, as a function of the parameters mi and mi, around one of the singularities
described above: there is non-trivial monodromy. to make this concrete we can choose a
particular branch of the multi-valued functions (3.13) and then interpret the monodromy as
transformations on the charges as one crosses a cut. around the singularity mj = ml the
transformation is

ti  ti,

si  si + il  ij,

si  si

while around the second kind of singularity mj = ml

ti  ti,

si  si + il,

si  si  ij

7neither of these possibilities is in conict with the absence of goldstone bosons in two-dimensions.

(3.15)

(3.16)

21

it is easy to see that if j 6= k in (3.15) and for any j in (3.16), repeated application of these
transformations does not preserve the semi-classical spectrum. for instance, for the states
with ti = il  ik and si = sti, for integer s, the monodromy transformation around the
singularity mj = ml, j 6= k, l, induces si  sti + il  ij, which is a state in the spectrum in
the region (2.36). however, a further such transformation gives si  sti + 2il  2ij which
is not commensurate with the semi-classical spectrum. the resolution of this paradox, is that
the contour around the singularity mj = ml passes through a curve of marginal stability on
which the state decays into two other topologically charged states with charges t (1)
i = il  ij,
i = (s +2)t (1)
s(1)
. notice that this kind of decay is in addition
to the soliton decay to soliton plus fundamental fermion that we saw in the last section. if
we think of the masses mi and mi as a set of points in the complex plane, then the curve
of marginal stability is identied with congurations of points where mj lies on the straight
line joining mk and ml. on the curve, the simple semi-classical analysis of section 2 must be
re-evaluated because the moduli space of the charge ti = il  ik soliton is larger than that
of the embedded cp 1 soliton. the enlarged moduli space of solutions, can be interpreted as
two superposed solitons with charges t (1)
, above, and the original soliton decays at
threshold into these two constituents. this mechanism for decay is precisely the same as that
seen for dyons at weak coupling in supersymmetric gauge theories [23, 24].

so far we have determined the exact mass formula for bps states with arbitrary global and
topological charges. however, except in the weak-coupling limit of the low-energy -model,
we do not know which states are present in the theory. in general, as we vary the parameters
appearing in the twisted superpotential, we may cross curves of marginal stability on which
bps states can decay. even in the simplest case of target space cp 1, the existence of such
curves was demonstrated in [2]. fortunately there is a special point in parameter space where
we may determine the exact bps spectrum. we rst consider the case n = 0. if we set all
twisted masses to zero, we have the standard supersymmetric cp n 1 -model. this theory is
integrable and its exact spectrum and s-matrix are known. also, at this point only, the model
has an unbroken su(n) global symmetry and the bps states are organised in multiplets of
this symmetry. to make contact with the analysis of the twisted superpotential we note that,
for n = 0 and mi = 0 the complex equation (3.8) reduces to n = n . the vacua ek,
k = 1, 2, . . . , n are then located at the vertices of a regular n-gon in the complex -plane,

ek =  exp(cid:18)2ik
n (cid:19)

(3.17)

as the twisted masses vanish, the theory has a z2n symmetry which is spontaneously broken
to z2 by the vev of . the zn symmetry of the n-gon comes from the quotient z2n /z2.

according to (3.10), the mass of a soliton interpolating between the vacua with  = el and

22

 = ek is mk,l = |2we|. because of the zn symmetry this only depends on the dierence
p = l  k. the resulting mass is

n

mk,l =

it is also known [6] that for p = 1, 2 . . . n the degeneracy of bps states is,



exp(cid:18)2ip

 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
n (cid:19)  1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
dp =(cid:18) n
p (cid:19)

(3.18)

(3.19)

the lightest soliton states with p = 1 and degeneracy n are interpreted as the elementary
quanta of the the chiral elds i [21]. in fact they carry charge +1 under the unbroken u(1)
gauge symmetry. these states transform in the fundamental representation of the avour sym-
metry group su(n). the states with p > 1 correspond to stable bound states of p dierent
avours of elementary quanta and therefore transform in the pth antisymmetric tensor repre-
sentation of su(n) which agrees with the degeneracy dp in (3.19). these are the only bps
states of the model. the complete bps spectrum of the supersymmetric cp n 1 -model ob-
tained in this way, including both the fundamental solitons and their boundstates, is consistent
with various exact results which can be obtained by invoking the integrability of the model.

in the vicinity of the strong coupling point, where all the masses mi are small, the degeneracy
of the states is broken and the states with a topological charge ti = il  ik are associated
to dp dierent contours in the -plane which join the points el and ek. as explained in [1],
the dierent contours can be constructed from some base contour joining el and ek, by taking
the contours which dier from this by encircling, in a positive sense, the p distinct points mja,
a = 1, . . . , p, chosen from the set {mi}. this gives rise to precisely dp dierent states with
global charge

si = ni  ij1      ijp

(3.20)

where ni is some xed set of integers which depends upon the choice of branch for the multi-
valued function mdi. this preferred set of contours can be shown to arise very naturally from
the type iia string description of the model [1].

we can now compare the strong coupling and weak coupling spectra. it is clear that, as in
the cp 1 case, there are an a innite number of states at weak coupling while the set of states
at strong coupling is nite. this implies that semi-classical regime must be separated from the
strong coupling regime by curves on which almost all of the weak coupling states decay. this
is familiar from the behaviour of dyon states in su(2) n = 2 sqcd [7]. moreover, as in gauge
theory case, the strong coupling states are a subset of the weak coupling states since states

23

with global charge (3.20) are realized in some region of the moduli space at weak coupling, as
bound-states of the soliton with fermions (2.38).

finally, we will consider the theory without twisted masses in the more general case of
arbitrary n and n . in this case there is a cancellation of a factor of  n between the numerator
and denominator of (3.8). as discussed above this indicates the presence of a non-compact
higgs branch at  = 0. as n chiral multiplets of each charge become massless at this point
the higgs branch has complex dimension 2 n  1. after the cancellation the equation which
determines the supersymmetric vacua reduces to n  n = n  n . this is the same equation
which arises in the case of the supersymmetric cp n  n 1 -model with zero twisted masses.
this is not a coincidence; we can lift the higgs branch by introducing suitable complex mass
terms. as complex masses can be thought of as the scalar components of background chiral
superelds they cannot modify the twisted superpotential which determines the soliton masses.
by taking the complex masses large we can decouple the n chiral multiplets whose vevs
parametrize the higgs branch and the resulting theory theory has n  n chiral multiplets of
charge +1 under u(1)g and none of charge 1. the theory then reduces to the supersymmetric
cp n  n -model at low-energy. as for the n = 0 models discussed above, the strong coupling
spectrum contains a subset of the states that appear at weak coupling.

we will now briey summarize our results for theory a. the exact central charge of the
theory is dened by (3.11) and (3.12). this formula is valid for all e and it applies equally in the
-model limit e  . if enough of the twisted mass dierences |mimj| are much greater than
||, the low-energy -model is weakly coupled and the bps spectrum is essentially that of the
classical theory described in the previous section. in particular the bps spectrum in the region
consists of elementary particles, kinks which interpolate between each pair of vacua, and an
innite tower of dyons associated with each kink. there are also soliton-fermion boundstates.
on the other hand we have also determined the bps spectrum for the theory with zero twisted
masses. in this case we nd, 2 n  1 massless chiral multiplets on the higgs branch while on the
coulomb branch there are n  n supersymmetric vacua and a spectrum of massive solitons
identical to that of the supersymmetric cp n  n 1 model. the model with zero twisted masses
has a global su(n  n )  u( n ) symmetry and non-anomalous z2n 2 n r-symmetry which is
spontaneously broken to z2. introducing complex masses lifts the higgs branch but does not
change the coulomb branch vacua or the bps soliton mass. on the other hand, introducing
non-zero twisted masses breaks the global su(n  n) symmetry. if the masses are small the
only eect is to introduce small mass splittings in the multiplets described above. however, as
the masses are increased the theory can cross curves of marginal stability on which the bps
spectrum can change. in fact, the presence of such curves is certainly required to explain the
dierence between the strong coupling spectrum obtained here which has a nite number of

24

bps states and the weak coupling spectrum which has an innite number.

4 theory b

we turn now to the spectra of the four-dimensional theories described in the introduction.
hence we will consider n = 2 sqcd with n colours and nf > n fundamental hypermultiplets
with masses m for  = 1, . . . , nf . this theory has received a great deal of attention in recent
years and we need only be brief. the bosonic eld content of theory b consists of an su(n)
gauge eld and a single complex scalar, , transforming in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group. a further nf complex scalars, denoted q
a, with a = 1, . . . , n, transform in
the fundamental representation of the gauge group and nf complex scalars, qa
, in the anti-
fundamental representation.

the moduli space of supersymmetric vacua is found by solving the classical d- and f-
term equations. a detailed description of the various branches which occur was given in [4]
and we will now summarize the relevant results. the classical theory has a coulomb branch
on which the adjoint scalar vev lies in the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group:  =
a=1 a = 0. the complex variables a, with a = 1, . . . , n, parametrize
gauge-inequivalent vacua, modulo the weyl group of su(n). the theory also has various higgs
branches which are characterised as baryonic or non-baryonic, depending on whether or not
there is a non-vanishing vev of the gauge invariant operators,

diag(1, . . . , n ) withpn

b1...n = q1
b1...n = qa1

a1 . . . qn
1 . . . qan

n

a1...an .

q

non-baryonic branches have b = b = 0 and are parametrized instead by the gauge-invariant
mesons m 
a. the classical coulomb branch is corrected by quantum eects while
the higgs branches, being protected by a non-renormalization theorem, are not. the higgs
branches intersect the coulomb branch at singular points where extra degrees of freedom be-
come massless. although the higgs branches themselves are not corrected, their intersection
with the coulomb branch may be dierent in the classical and quantum theories.

in the present context we are interested in the theory at the root of its rst baryonic branch.
in the classical theory with vanishing masses, m = 0, this branch has quaternionic dimension
nf n  n 2 + 1 and emanates from the origin of the coulomb branch. when non-zero masses
are introduced we must solve the modied f-term equations,

q

a(m + a) = qa

(m + a) = 0

no summation over  or a.

(4.1)

25

in order for the scalars to satisfy (4.1) while still having non-vanishing expectation value for
b and b, the adjoint scalar vevs must take values a = m(a), where {m(a)} is a set of
n masses chosen from the m,  = 1, . . . , nf . up to weyl group transformations, there are
nf choose n possible sets and each choice gives a baryonic root from which a higgs branch
of complex dimension one may emanate. to choose a particular root, we will label the masses
as m = mi for  = i = 1, . . . , n and m = mi with  = i + n for i = 1, . . . , n = nf  n
and then set a = miia. this solution is only consistent with the tracelessness of the adjoint
representation of su(n) if we have pn
i=1 mi = 0. as discussed in the introduction the masses
mi and mi will be identied with the twisted masses of theory a which carry the same indices.

at a generic point on its coulomb branch, the four-dimensional theory has classical central

charge,

n

nf

a(qa +  ha) +

ms

(4.2)

z =

xa=1

x=1

where  = 4i/g2 +/2 is the complexied gauge coupling and qa, ha and s are integer valued
electric, magnetic and global charges respectively. specializing this expression to the baryonic
root dened above we may rewrite the central charge as,

z =

n

xi=1

mi(si +  ti) +

mi

si

n

xi=1

(4.3)

where we have redened charges as si = sa  qa and ti = ha for i = a = 1, . . . , n and
si = si+n for i = 1, . . . , n. note that the electric charges become parallel to a subset of
the global charges at the baryonic root and we have absorbed them with an integer shift in
the denition of the global generators. the resulting expression for the classical central charge
exactly matches its two-dimensional counterpart (2.30)

let us now consider which values of the charges si, si and ti occur in the four dimensional
theory. we will consider n = 2 vector multiplets and hypermultiplets in turn. at a generic
point on the coulomb branch the theory includes n  1 massless abelian vector multiplets
which correspond to the unbroken u(1)n 1 gauge symmetry. the remaining generators of the
gauge group give n(n  1) massive vector multiplets which carry non-zero electric charges. at
the baryonic root the charges which arise correspond to si = ik  ij for each k 6= j thus we
have n(n  1) vector multiplets with distinct masses |mk  mj|. the spectrum at the baryonic
root also contains n massless quark hypermultiplets whose scalar components are q=i
a=i and
q=i
a=i for i = 1, . . . n. these states have non-zero electric charges qa=i and non-zero global
charges s=i which cancel to give si = 0. these massless quarks each acquire non-zero vevs
on the baryonic branch itself.

26

finally, and most importantly in the present context, theory b also has a diverse spectrum
of massive hypermultiplets which includes quarks, monopoles and dyons. these massive quark
states correspond to the remaining components of the hypermultiplets which carry electric
charges qa=i and global charges s=i and yield non-zero values of si and si. the resulting
spectrum includes n(n  1) states with charges si = ik  ij and si = 0 which have masses
|mk  mj| as well as n(nf  n) states with charges si = ik and si = ij which have masses
|mk  mj|. the total number of massive quark hypermultiplets is therefore n(nf  1) =
n(n + n  1). this agrees with the classical spectrum of elementary particles of theory a.
all further bps states have non-zero magnetic charge. while the existence of classical
solutions in various topological sectors is well known, the existence of quantum bound states is
more problematic. for systems with a single higgs eld or, equivalently, for real adjoint higgs
vevs, a, this requires detailed knowledge of the monopole moduli spaces for higher rank
gauge groups (see for example [22]). however, as rst discussed in [23], the situation simplies
greatly for generic complex vevs and semi-classical quantization reduces to the corresponding
problem with all elds restricted to su(2) subgroups of the gauge group. the spectrum arising
from each subgroup can then be determined using a variety of methods [25, 26, 7]. the resulting
monopole spectrum contains n(n  1) dierent states with magnetic charges ti = il  ik for
each l 6= k and with masses 4|ml  mk|/g2, in agreement with the classical soliton spectrum of
theory a. in addition to these purely magnetic states, the spectrum also contains an innite
tower of dyons associated to each of the su(2) subgroups and with charges si = sti for integer
values of s. once again, this coincides with the excited soliton spectrum of theory a.

however, just as for theory a, this is not the whole story because dyons can form bound-
states with quarks. to our knowledge, the spectrum of such states has not been constructed
in the literature and so to this we devote appendix b. the results are as follows. we work
at a generic point in the moduli space, so that the moduli space of a monopole is that of a
monopole in an su(2) gauge theory. at the baryonic root, we nd the following spectrum of
bound-states of quarks with the dyon having charges ti = il  ik and si = sti:

(1) with the quark with charges si = il  ij and si = 0 in the region

0 < re(cid:18) ml  mj

ml  mk(cid:19) < 1

(2) with the quark with charges si = il and si = ij in the region

0 < re(cid:18) ml  mj

ml  mk(cid:19) < 1

27

(4.4)

(4.5)

notice that the bound-states have exactly the same quantum numbers as the soliton fermion
bound-states in theory a and moreover regions (4.4) and (4.5) are precisely the same as regions
(2.36) and (2.37), respectively. at the boundary the bound-state will decay to a dyon and a
quark in exactly the same way as in theory a. we conclude from this that the weak coupling
spectrum of topologically charged bps states is identical in theory a and b.

while we have shown classical agreement between the masses of the bps massive hyper-
multiplet spectrum of theory b and the the bps spectrum of theory a, the spectrum and
low-energy interactions of the four-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory are cor-
rected by quantum eects.
in the asymptotically free case nf < 2n the coupling constant
runs at one loop and the complex classical parameter  is replaced by the rg invariant scale
. the theory also has an anomaly in the u(1) part of the r-symmetry group which is bro-
ken to z4n 2nf . this residual discrete symmetry is explicitly broken down to z2 for non-zero
hypermultiplet masses. at the baryonic root, theory b is described by the degenerate elliptic
curve,

f (t, v) =

tn nf

nf n

yi=1

(v  mi) 

n

(v  mi)
yi=1

(cid:0)t  n(cid:1)

(4.6)

this is equivalent to the curve describing the baryonic root given in [4]. all parameters and
variables in the curve have even charge under z4n 2nf and thus, as in [4], the eective symmetry
of the curve is the z2 quotient z2n nf = zn  n . this form of the curve occurs naturally in the
m-theory construction of [3] which we review in section 5. the curve is branched over the n
points ei, with i = 1, 2, . . . , n, dened by,

n

yi=1

(v + mi)  n  n

n

(v + mi) =

yi=1

n

yi=1
(v  ei) = 0

(4.7)

note that this is the same as equation (3.9) which determines the critical points of the twisted
superpotential of theory a.

as in theory a, the case of vanishing masses mi = mi = 0 will be of particular interest.
in this case, the low-energy theory at the baryonic root has an unbroken su( n )  u(1)n  n
gauge symmetry [4] with nf massless avours in the fundamental representation of su( n).
thus the spectrum of the theory includes the corresponding massless quarks and gluons. this
is consistent because the condition nf = n + n < 2n which guarantees that the microscopic
theory is asymptotically free, implies that nf > 2 n, which ensures that the low-energy theory
is ir free. the massless spectrum at this point also includes n  n hypermultiplets which
are neutral under the non-abelian factor of the unbroken gauge group. the theory with zero

28

masses also has an unbroken su(n  n) global symmetry and a z2n 2 n r-symmetry which
is unbroken at the baryonic root.

in the quantum theory the central charge is given by the integral of the seiberg-witten
dierential sw = vd(log t) over certain one cycles of the curve. the resulting modication of
the classical formula (4.3) is

with

thus we have shown that the central charge of theory b agrees with the exact central charge
(3.11,3.12) of theory a in the previous section.

although we have complete agreement between the central charges of theory a and theory
b, it still remains to compare which values of the quantum numbers si, si and ti actually appear
in the bps spectra of the two theories. as long as we choose the masses mi so that a sucient
number of gauge bosons have masses much larger than the dynamical scale , theory b is
weakly coupled and its spectrum is essentially the classical spectrum described above. hence,
in this regime, massive hypermultiplets of theory b are in one-to-one correspondence with bps
states of theory a. however, there is more: the curves of marginal stability at weak coupling
in theory a, where topologically charged bps solitons decay, have a precise correspondence in
theory b, where the associated magnetically charged dyon states decay. in the gauge theory,
these curves correspond to regions were the dimension of the monopole moduli space enlarges
discontinuously corresponding to the freedom for the dyon to separate into its decay products
[23, 24]. away from weak coupling, the determination of which states appear in the bps
spectra of either case is complicated by the presence of additional curves of marginal stability.

29

because the exact central charges agree, the same curves of marginal stability occur in both
theories. this suggests, but does not guarantee, that the two spectra agree throughout the
parameter space. in the next section we will consider a brane conguration which provides
further evidence for this proposal.

one interesting consequence of the proposed equivalence is obtained by setting all twisted
masses to zero. this leads to a novel connection between four-dimensional n = 2 sqcd with n
colours and nf = n + n massless avours at the baryonic root and the supersymmetric cp n  n
-model in two-dimensions. both theories are asymptotically free and have a u(1)r symmetry
which broken to a z2n 2 n subgroup by instantons. according to [4] the global symmetry on
the baryonic branch is su(n  n) which is the same as the global symmetry of the cp n  n
-model. in addition to the massless spectrum of the four-dimensional theory described above,
we should nd massive hypermultiplet corresponding to each state in the -model spectrum.
thus we predict massive hypermultiplets transforming in the fundamental representation of
the global symmetry group as well as bound states transforming in each antisymmetric tensor
representation. in appendix b, we show that anti-symmetric tensor multiplets of the larger
symmetry group su(nf ) exist at weak coupling for zero masses but large vevs, i.e. not at
the baryonic root.

5 the brane conguration

the technique of realising eld theories as the world-volume dynamics of intersecting brane
congurations in type ii string theory [27] has proved very powerful in recent years, providing
a geometrical description of many strong-coupling phenomena in eld theory. in fact it is well
known how to construct either theory a or theory b introduced above on the world-volume of
type iia branes which are subsequently elevated to m-theory. the four-dimensional theory was
rst studied in this context by witten in [3], where it was shown that the m5-brane provides
a concrete realisation of the seiberg-witten curves. the brane model of the two dimensional
theory was studied by hanany and hori [1]. in the following sections we review both of these
constructions and in, particular, how bps spectrum is realized in each case. in both theories,
bps states correspond to m2 branes with boundaries on m5 branes. in both cases, the relevant
boundaries are non-trivial one-cycles on the same riemann surface.

we look rst at the brane picture for the two-dimensional theory described in [1]. the
conguration involves a pair of non-parallel ns 5-branes. the rst of the pair spans world-
volume directions 012345 and is positioned at x6 = x7 = x8 = x9 = 0. the second ns 5-brane

is rotated with respect to the rst, spanning world-volume directions 014589. such a rotation
of the second ns 5-brane is typical when constructing theories with four supercharges and this
brane is often referred to as an ns 5-brane. it is located at x2 = x3 = 0, and at some xed
value of x6 and x7. the conguration also involves n + n semi-innite d4-branes ending on
the ns 5-brane. each spans world-volume directions 01236 and is located at x7 = x8 = x9 = 0
and at a xed value of x4 and x5. the d4-branes may end on the ns 5-brane either from the
left (world-volume x6 < 0) or from the right (x6 > 0). for our purposes we require n to
end from the right, and the remaining n to end from the left. we will refer to the former as
d4-branes and the latter as d4-branes. a recent paper which discusses similar congurations
of semi-innite d4-branes is [28].

the u(1) two-dimensional gauge theory is realised as the low-energy dynamics of a single
d2-brane suspended between the ns and ns 5-brane, with world-volume coordinates 017. the
d2-brane has nite extent in the x7 direction and is innite in x0 and x1, these latter dimensions
playing the role of the eld theory space-time. the nal conguration is depicted in gure 1.
it preserves four supercharges as required for n = (2, 2) supersymmetry in two-dimensions.
hanany and hori argue that strings stretched between the d2-brane and semi-innite d4-branes
become chiral multiplets in two dimensions leading to theory a described in the introduction.

parameters of the eld theory are encoded as positions of the various branes. the vev of
the vector multiplet scalar and the twisted mass parameters both correspond to the positions

rotational symmetry in the 45-plane is identied with the u(1)a r-symmetry of the n = (2, 2)
theory. the distances between the two 5-branes in the x6 and x7 directions are related to the
bare fi parameter and bare gauge coupling respectively,

(5.1)

where gst is the string coupling constant, x = x(ns)  x(ns), and we are working in units
where the string length-scale  is set to one. for x6 = 0, both ends of the d2-brane lie on
a 5-brane, and it is free roam the (x4, x5) plane. this corresponds to the coulomb branch of
the gauge theory. for x6 > 0, the d2-brane must end on one of the d4-branes and is therefore
restricted to lie at one of n xed positions in x4 and x5 (this situation is shown in gure 1).
for generic mass terms, these positions correspond to the n classical vacua of the eld theory
for r > 0 described in section 2. similarly, for x6 < 0 there n choices of d4-brane on which
the d2-brane may terminate.

while the type iia picture captures many of the classical properties of the eld theory,
including the classical moduli space of vacua, quantum eects are reproduced only after raising
the conguration to m-theory [1]. as noted in that reference, the eld theory limit of m-theory
diers from the supergravity limit. nevertheless we expect certain quantities, in particular
masses of bps states, to be correctly determined in the supergravity approximation. in eleven
dimensions the system comprised of the ns 5-brane, d4-branes and d4-branes combines to
become a single m5-brane, while the ns 5-brane evolves into a at m5-brane and the d2-brane
becomes an m2-brane suspended between the two. we deal rst with ns 5-brane and d4 ( d4)-
branes. the world-volumes of all these branes share the 0123 coordinates and the resulting m5-
brane is correspondingly at in these directions. the remaining world-volume directions of the
m5-brane describe a two-dimensional curve, , lying in the submanifold r3  s1, parametrised
by x4, x5, x6 and periodic coordinate x10 = x10 + 2r. the preservation of eight supercharges
requires this curve to be embedded holomorphically with respect to the complex coordinates

d4-branes and evolves to a at m5-brane with world-volume directions 014589. its position
in the x6 and x10 directions is given by

t = n

(5.4)

unlike the type iia picture, the m5-branes no longer have a denite x6 separation and the
quantity x6(v) is interpreted as the running fi parameter in agreement with eld theory
[1]. in addition the curved m5 brane conguration is no longer invariant under rotations in
the 45-plane. this corresponds to the u(1)a anomaly which appears at one-loop in the two-
dimensional quantum theory.

the m-theory description of the d2-brane is as an m2-brane, stretched between the at
and curved m5-branes. like its d2 descendant, the m2-brane world-volume is innite in the
01 directions and nite in x7. unlike the m5-branes however, the m2-brane does not have a
xed conguration. rather, dierent congurations correspond to dierent states of the two-
dimensional gauge theory. for example, supersymmetry is unbroken in the vacuum state of
the gauge theory and this is reected in the corresponding m2-brane ground conguration by
the requirement that it preserve four supercharges. the only such m2-brane congurations
are straight strips lying at a xed value of v and t. it must intersect the two m5-branes and
therefore has to lie at t = n . the possible positions in the v-plane are then determined by

n

(5.5)

in agreement with eld theoretic expectations (3.9). excited states in the eld theory corre-
spond to excited states of the m2-brane, no longer a straight strip but a topologically non-trivial
surface with boundaries on the two m5-branes. we will return to these states after rst re-
viewing the four-dimensional theory.

the type iia realisation of pure su(n) n = 2 sym consists of n d4-branes suspended
between two parallel ns 5-branes. the latter span world-volume directions 012345. each is

33

located at x7 = x8 = x9 = 0 and at a xed x6 value. the separation of the two ns5-branes in
the x6 direction determines the bare four-dimensional coupling constant,

x6
gst

=

g2

(5.6)

the four-dimensional theory itself lives on the world-volume of the d4-branes, spanning direc-
tions 01236. the d4-branes are nite in the x6 direction and at large distances their low-energy
dynamics are described by d = 4, su(n) n = 2 sym with x0, . . . , x3 playing the role of space-
time [3]. the d4-branes are free to move in the v-plane and their positions in these directions
parametrise the classical coulomb branch of the theory.

hypermultiplets transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group may be
incorporated in one of two ways: using either d6-branes or d4-branes. we choose the latter.
the world-volumes of these d4-branes also span directions 01236. each is attached to one of
the two ns 5-branes and are thus semi-innite in the x6 direction.
in order to exhibit the
similarity to theory a in the most transparent manner, we choose to attach n semi-innite d4-
branes to the right-hand ns 5-brane. these have world-volume x6  +. the remaining
n d4-branes are attached to the left-hand ns 5-brane, have world-volume x6   and,
in analogy with theory a, will be referred to as d4-branes. the position of each semi-innite
d4-brane in the v-plane determines the mass of the corresponding hypermultiplet.

as explained in the previous section, the root of the baryonic higgs branch occurs classically
when the vevs are equal to the masses of some set of n hypermultiplets. the particular
brane conguration described above above naturally selects n hypermultiplets as those ending
on the right-hand ns 5-brane. the root of this baryonic higgs branch then corresponds to
the situation depicted in gure 2.

as in the two-dimensional case, many quantum aspects of the eld theory are uncovered by
elevating this conguration to eleven dimensions. generically, such a system of ns 5-branes and
d4-branes becomes a single smooth object in m-theory. the world-volume of this single m5-
brane spans directions 0123 and describes a two-dimensional surface embedded in x4, x5, x6 and
x10. once again, the preservation of eight supercharges requires the curve to be holomorphic
with respect to the complex structures (5.2).

for the iia conguration corresponding to an arbitrary point on the coulomb branch, the

lift to m-theory is described by

f (t, v) = a(v)t2 + b(v)t + c(v) = 0

this is the curve used in section 4 to obtain the exact bps spectrum of theory b. importantly,
at the root of the baryonic higgs branch the curve has a very simple factorisation. the single

35

m5-brane can be thought of as degenerating into two m5-branes, each described by one of the
factors of (5.9). the rst factor corresponds to a non-trivial m5-brane, while the second is
simply a at m5-brane located at t = n . notice that the rst factor is precisely the curve 
describing the ns 5-brane and d4-branes of the two-dimensional theory (5.3). of course, this
is not surprising considering the similarity of the type iia congurations for theories a and b.

we now turn to the description of bps states in the two theories, starting with theory a [1].
states of the eld theory correspond to states of the m2-brane. we have already seen how the
ground states of the eld theory are reproduced by the m2-brane states (5.5) preserving four
supercharges. the m-theory realisation of bps states may be identied in a similar manner
as m2-brane congurations preserving two supercharges.
in appendix c we show that this
condition requires the spatial part of the m2-brane world-volume form to be the pull-back of

where  is the holomorphic two-form

 =  + dx7  dx1

 = ds  dv

(5.10)

(5.11)

the mass of such a bps state is given by the dierence between the mass of the corresponding
excited m2-brane and the ground m2-brane. each is given by the area of the brane multiplied
by the brane tension, t , and may be regulated by introducing a cut-o on the integration over
x1. the ground state brane, which we denote as m20, is at xed values of both v and t and
has world-volume given by the pull-back of dx7  dx1. the mass of any bps state is therefore
given by

m = t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
zm2
= t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

dx1  dx7 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

this formula for the mass of bps states was also proposed in [1] using dierent arguments.
the mass is seen to be independent of x7 in agreement with eld theory expectations that
the masses of bps states do not depend on the gauge coupling constant, e. to make contact
with the bps mass formula of section 3, note that  is exact;  = dsw , where

sw = v

dt
t

36

(5.12)

is recognised, in the four-dimensional context, as the seiberg-witten dierential introduced in
section 4. using stokes theorem, the mass of the bps states can be rewritten as

m = t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
zm2

sw (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(5.13)

where m2 is the boundary of the m2-brane. for x7 = 0, this boundary consists of two
curves, each lying on one of the m5-branes. denote the curve on the at m5-brane as cr and
that on the curved m5-brane as cl. then,

zcl+cr

m = t (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

sw (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

zcl

sw (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where the second equality follows because sw vanishes over the at m5-brane (5.4) positioned
at a xed value of t. note that the masses of the bps states depending only on the details of
the curved m5 brane  (5.3). the m-theory realisation of bps states in the four-dimensional
theory were discussed in detail in [29, 30]. they also correspond to holomorphically embedded
m2-branes with world-volume form given by the pull-back of  and with boundary on the
m5-branes. the mass of such a state is given by the integral of the seiberg-witten dierential
over the boundary of the m2-brane, in agreement with (5.13). moreover, the factorisation of
the seiberg-witten curve at the baryonic root ensures that, as in theory a, the masses of bps
states are determined solely by a choice of boundary cl on , the curved part of the m5-brane
(5.9).

although we have shown both in eld theory and from branes that the bps mass formula
for the two theories agrees, we would like conclude that the quantum numbers of bps states
appearing in the two theories are the same throughout parameter space. as mentioned in the
previous sections, there is no obvious way to do this using conventional eld theory methods. in
the brane context, determining which bps states appear is equivalent to determining which bps
congurations of the m2 brane are allowed. in the present case this amounts to determining
which one-cycles on the curve  can arise as boundaries of a bps m2 brane. at least for small
masses, this problem was solved explicitly for theory a in [1], yielding agreement with previous
results for the cp n 1 -model. here we simply note that the equivalent problem for theory
b is essentially identical and the same analysis should apply. this provides further evidence
for the exact agreement of the bps spectra of the two theories.

finally, we should comment on the fact that not all bps states of theory b appear in
spectrum of theory a. specically, only the massive hypermultiplets of theory b participate

37

in the correspondence. the fact that the massless states of theory b have no counterparts
in theory a corresponds to a general feature of congurations involving branes of dierent
dimensions which was rst discussed in [27]: moduli in the higher-dimensional world-volume
theory correspond to parameters in the lower-dimensional world-volume theory. by n = 2
susy all massless elds in theory b are associated with scalar moduli. as these moduli
become parameters in theory b, we know that the corresponding massless degrees of freedom
must decouple from the two-dimensional spectrum. the question of what happens to the
massive vector multiplets of theory b is more subtle as these states have exactly the same
masses and charges as some of the hypermultiplets at the baryonic root. because of this
degeneracy, it seems possible that a massive vector multiplet can be interpreted as a threshold
boundstate of a massive hypermultiplet and some massless ones. in principle, the existence
of such threshold bound-states may be sensitive to deformations of the theory, such as those
considered above, which leave the spectrum of truly stable bps states invariant. clearly this
aspect of the correspondence requires further investigation.

appendix a

in this appendix we give some details of the soliton solutions of the theory in terms of the
(r, ) variables of equation (2.26). from (2.29) we deduce that a bps saturated soliton

which describes a straight line-segment in the  plane which joins the points  = 0 and  = +.
the resulting central charge is just z = 2w = im = im(ir + /2) and bps mass

appendix b

(a.6)

(a.7)

(a.8)

in this appendix, we construct the weak coupling spectrum of bound-states of dyons and quarks
in an n = 2 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory with nf hypermultiplets. consider the
monopole solution with topological (magnetic) charge ha = ac  ab. at a generic point in
the space of higgs vevs, the moduli space of such solutions will be completely described by
embedding an su(2) monopole solution in the su(n) gauge group [23]. in our analysis, we shall

39

avoid submanifolds of co-dimension one, where the space of solutions enlarges discontinuously.
these submanifolds correspond to regions where some d lies on the line segment joining b
with c and are surfaces on which dyons can decay to other dyons.

before we proceed, we nd it useful to introduce the roots and weights of su(n). to
this end, we introduce ea, a = 1, . . . , n, the weights of the n representation. the roots are
then ea  eb. the monopole that we are considering has a topological charge equal to the
root h   = ec  eb. we now analyse the time-independent dirac equation for the fermion
eld 
}, in the background of the monopole. the resulting
equation is only non-trivial if a = b or a = c and without loss of generality we can choose a = b.
the dirac equation is given by a generalization of that written down in [23] which includes an
explicit mass term:

a, in the hypermultiplet {q

a, qa

here

d s (cid:19) 
(cid:18) s d

b = e
b

d = i~  ~d + ip ,

d = i~  ~d  ip

(b.1)

(b.2)

where ~ are the pauli sigma matrices and ~d is the spatial part of the covariant derivative in
the background of the monopole solution. the other quantities in (b.1) and (b.2) are

p = ctc + re(ei)  h  |  |
2
s = im(ei)  h + im(eim)

  h + re(eim)

(b.3)

where  is the phase of   , the tc are the generators of the su(2) corresponding to the
root , c is the higgs eld of the su(2) bps monopole and h are the cartan generators of
su(n).

we will now show that bps bound-states of the monopole, and its dyonic excitations, with
the quark exists whenever d has a normalizable zero-mode. suppose that such a mode 
exists. this implies that the dirac operator has an eigenvector:

b

d s (cid:19)(cid:18)
(cid:18) s d

b

0 (cid:19) = im(cid:0)e  eb + em(cid:1)(cid:18)
0 (cid:19)

b

(b.4)

where we used the fact that h
b . to show that the bound-state is bps saturated,
we notice that although the mode is not a zero-mode of the full dirac operator, but only of d,
it contributes to the central charge in just such a way as to preserve the bps condition. the
central charge of the bound-state is z =     +   ea + m and hence the bps mass is

b = eb

m =(cid:12)(cid:12)    +   eb + m(cid:12)(cid:12) =(cid:12)(cid:12)   (cid:12)(cid:12) + im(cid:0)ei  eb + eim(cid:1) +   

40

(b.5)

here the rst term is the mass of the monopole, the second term is precisely the energy of
the fermion mode and the ellipsis are corrections in g which encode the back-reaction of the
fermion elds on the monopole that we have not accounted for in our simple analysis. notice
the this line of reasoning is analogous to our analysis of the soliton-fermion bound-states in
theory a. the semi-classical description of the bound-state is completely standard (see for
example [31]). the fermion mode is associated to a pair of raising and lowering operators  and
 with canonical anti-commutation relation {, } = 1. the monopole carries a fock space
representation of these operators, in other words there is a vacuum state |0i, which represents
the original monopole, and an excited state |0i, which represents the bound-state. in addition,
the monopole wavefunction also includes the usual dyonic excitation piece which implies that
each bound-state gives rise to a tower of states with magnetic charge h = , electric charge
q = s + eb, for an integer s, and global charge s = .

so our problem is now reduced to searching for normalizable zero-modes of d. fortunately
this analysis is a simple generalization of that in [23]. there exists a single normalizable zero-
mode if

1 < re(cid:18)   (eb + ec) + 2m

  

(cid:19) < 1

(b.6)

we now analyse this condition at the baryonic root, where a    ea = miia. further-
more, in order to facilitate comparison with theory a, we shall write the topological charge of
the dyon as  = ek  el, and so    = ml  mk, and the fermion to have mass m equal to
(i) mj (ii) mj. for the rst case the region where the bound-state exists is

0 < re(cid:18) ml  mj

ml  mk(cid:19) < 1

0 < re(cid:18) ml  mj

ml  mk(cid:19) < 1

(b.7)

(b.8)

with quantum numbers ti = il  ik, si = sti + il  ij and si = 0. while in the second case
the bound-state exists in a region

with quantum numbers ti = il ik, si = sti + il and si = ij. in overlapping regions (b.7)
and (b.8) there will be multiple bound-states obtaining by lling out the states of a higher
dimensional fock space.

it is also interesting to analysis the spectrum of bound-state with zero masses m = 0. in

this case the condition for the existence of a bound-state is

0 < re(cid:18) l

l  k(cid:19) < 1

41

(b.9)

in this region, there are nf degenerate fermion modes 
l ,  = 1, . . . , nf , and the bound-states
are composed of a fock space representation of the nf creation and annihilation operator 
and 

. the states are therefore of the form

1    

p|0i

i 6= j

(b.10)

for a given p, these states transform in the pth anti-symmetric representation of the unbroken
su(nf ) avour symmetry group.

appendix c

in this appendix, using the methods of [32], we derive the world-volume form (5.10) for a m2-
brane preserving two supercharges. we follow closely the analogous calculation for bps states
in four-dimensional n = 2 theories performed by fayyazuddin and spalinski [33]. a convenient
choice of eleven dimensional gamma matrices m satisfying {m , n} = 2m n is given in the
appendix of this reference, such that m are real for m = 2, 5, 7, 8, 10 and purely imaginary for
other space-time indices and all gamma matrices with spatial indices are hermitian.

the number of supersymmetries preserved by an p-brane with embedding x m in r1,9  s1

is equal to the number of solutions to

 =

1
p!

1...pm1...mp1x m1...px mp

(c.1)

where m1...mp = [m1...mp] and  is an eleven dimensional majorana spinor (64 real compo-
nents) which can be decomposed as

 =  + b

where b is equal to the product of the real gamma matrices and determines the charge conjuga-
tion matrix c = b0. we rst consider solutions to (c.1) in the background of the m5-branes.
the ns 5-brane and d4-brane system lifts to the single m5-brane described by the curve (5.3).
it was shown explicitly in [33] that this preserves eight supercharges satisfying

v = s = 0
i0123 = 

(c.2)

where v and s are the gamma matrices in the complex basis (5.2). the at m5-brane enforces
a further condition on the spinor: 014589 = . using the rst equation in (c.2), it is
simple to show that this is equivalent to

i0189 = 

42

(c.3)

there are four real independent solutions to (c.2) and (c.3), equivalent to n = (2, 2) super-
symmetry in two dimensions. further, using the fact that the product of all gamma matrices
is proportional to the identity matrix, any spinor  satisfying both these conditions must also
satisfy

017 = 

this reects the fact that we may add a at m2-brane to the conguration while preserving
four supercharges. this m2-brane corresponds to the ground state of the two-dimensional eld
theory.

each state in the eld theory other than the vacuum corresponds to an excited m2-brane
which is no longer embedded at a xed value of v and s. the condition that this state be bps
requires the existence of a simultaneous solution to (c.2), (c.3) and

introducing the complex coordinate u = x1 + ix7, this condition becomes

 = 1

20m n x m x n 

 = 0(cid:8)(sv  vs)sv + (s v  v s)sv
+ (su  us)su + (s u   u s)su
+ (vu  uv)sv + (v u   u v)v u
+ (s u   us)su + (su  u s)su
+ (v u   uv)v u + (vu  u v)vu
+ i(s s + v v  ss  vv)0123
+ (u u   uu)uu(cid:9)

(c.4)

mercifully many of these terms vanish upon applying the projection operator q = ssvv,
and we are left with

b = (sv  vs)0sv  i(u u   uu)b

+i(s s + v v  ss  vv)0b

without the second term on the right-hand side, this is the equation determining the m2-brane
realisation of a bps state in the four-dimensional n = 2 theory. in the two-dimensional model
under consideration, the presence of this second term reects the spatial extension of the m2-
brane in the x1 and x7 directions. notice that any term appearing in (c.4) that contained both
u and either s or v is eliminated by the projection. finally, we act with a further projection,
p = 1

2 (1 + i0123), to arrive at the requirement

b = 0sv

43

which is identical to the four-dimensional bps condition [33]. moreover, the world-volume form
on the bps m2-brane is determined to be

 = sv  vs  iu u + i uu

which is indeed the pull-back of the two form  given in equation (5.10).
