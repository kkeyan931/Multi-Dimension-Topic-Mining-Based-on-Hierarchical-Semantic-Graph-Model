abstract

we investigate the problems of consistency and causality for the equations of mo-
tion describing massive spin two eld in external gravitational and massless scalar
dilaton elds in arbitrary spacetime dimension. from the eld theoretical point
of view we consider a general classical action with non-minimal couplings and nd
gravitational and dilaton background on which this action describes a theory con-
sistent with the at space limit. in the case of pure gravitational background all
eld components propagate causally. we show also that the massive spin two eld
can be consistently described in arbitrary background by means of the lagrangian
representing an innite series in the inverse mass. within string theory we ob-
tain equations of motion for the massive spin two eld coupled to gravity from
the requirement of quantum weyl invariance of the corresponding two dimensional
sigma-model. in the lowest order in  we demonstrate that these eective equations
of motion coincide with consistent equations derived in eld theory.

1 introduction

the purpose of this paper is twofold - rst, to describe consistent theory of massive spin
2 eld interacting with external gravity from the point of view of classical eld theory
and, second, to derive eective equations of motion for this eld from string theory.

the problem of consistent description of higher spin elds interaction has a long history
but is still far from the complete resolution. within framework of standard eld theory
it is possible to construct a classical action for the higher spin elds only on specic
curved spacetime manifolds [1][6]1. for example, massive integer spins are described
by symmetric tensors of corresponding ranks and one can write down the equations of
motion and nd classical actions for them but only in special spacetimes (e.g.
in ricci
at spaces). it means that in such an appoach gravity eld does not feel the presence of
higher spins matter through an energy-momentum tensor. so a consistent classical action
for the system of dynamical gravity and a higher massive eld is still unknown and there
are some indications that perhaps it does not exist at all.

one of these indications comes from considering a kaluza-klein decomposition of
einstein gravity in ddimensional spacetime into gravity plus innite tower of massive
second rank tensor elds in (d  1)dimensional world, masses being proportional to
inverse compactication radius. then the resulting four dimensional theory of spin 2
elds interacting with gravity and with each other should be consistent as one started
from the ordinary einstein theory and just considers it on a specic manifold. but as was
shown in [10], it is impossible to reduce this theory consistently to a nite number of spin
2 elds, i.e. consistency can be achieved only if the whole innite tower of higher massive
elds are present in the theory.

the main problem in higher spin elds theories is that introduction of interaction may
excite new unphysical degrees of freedom which lead in general to appearance of negative
norm states in the hilbert space and to violation of causality. in free theories these un-
physical degrees are absent due to transversality and tracelessness conditions. lagrangian
description of these conditions requires auxiliary elds vanishing on equations of motion
[11, 12]. in arbitrary interacting theories the auxiliary elds may become dynamical and
to make them vanishing again one has to impose some additional restrictions on the kind
of interaction.

as a rst step towards a full dynamical theory of interacting higher spin elds one
usually tries to describe a single higher spin massive eld in an external electromagnetic or
gravitational background [3, 5, 6, 13, 14, 15]. in this case one way to achieve consistency
is to impose appropriate restrictions on the external background eld. for example, it
is well known that consistent theories of higher massive spin elds can be easily built in
the spacetimes of constant curvature. in the section 2 we describe in detail the theory of
massive spin 2 eld in curved spacetime and show how these restrictions on the external

collection of massless spin-2 elds was investigated in [9]

gravitational background arise. as a result we will arrive to a one-parameter family of
lagrangian theories which describe consistent propagation of the spin 2 eld in arbitrary
einstein spacetime.

there exists another possible way to achieve consistency by constructing equations
for higher massive elds in form of innite series in inverse mass (or, equivalently, in
curvature). a recent attempt in this direction was undertaken in [6] where, however, only
theories on symmetric einstein manifolds were considered and consistent equations were
derived in the simplest approximation linear in curvature.

in this paper we demonstrate that consistent equations for the spin 2 massive eld
can, in principle, be constructed as innite series in inverse mass square in arbitrary
gravitational background. these kinds of innite series arise naturally in string theory
which represent another approach for consistent description of higher spins interaction.

string theory contains an innite number of massive elds with various spins inter-
acting with each other and with a nite number of massless elds. unfortunately, there
are arguments that in string theory a general coordinate invariant eective eld action
reproducing the correct s-matrix both for massless and massive string states does not
exist [16]. the full eective action for all string elds is not general coordinate invariant
and general covariance arises only as an approximate symmetry in eective action for
massless elds once all the massive elds are integrated out. that eective action for
massive elds cannot be covariant follows, for example, from the fact that terms cubic in
massive elds can contain only at metric and there is no terms of higher powers [16].

inuence of massive string modes is negligible at low energies but they become impor-
tant, for instance, in string cosmology [17] (for a recent review see e.g. [18]) so it would be
desirable to have consistent equations describing interaction of the massive string elds
with gravity.

and indeed, there exists a possibility to derive from the string theory some covariant
parts of equations for massive higher spins elds interacting with background gravity.
the aim of our paper is to show explicitly how this procedure works using as an example
dynamics of the second rank tensor from the rst massive level of open bosonic string.

a convenient method of deriving eective eld equations of motion from the string
theory is provided by the model approach [19][29]. within this approach a string
interacting with background elds is described by a two dimensional eld theory and
eective equations of motion arise from the requirement of quantum weyl invariance.
perturbative derivation of these equations is well suited for massless string modes be-
cause the corresponding two dimensional theory is renormalizable and loop expansion
corresponds to expansion of string eective action in powers of string length .

inclusion of interaction with massive modes [30][39] makes the theory non-renorma-
lizable but this fact does not represent a problem since in string theory one considers
the whole innite set of massive elds. innite number of counterterms needed for can-
cellation of divergences generating by a specic massive eld in classical action leads to
renormalization of an innite number of massive elds. the only property of the theory

2

crucial for possibility of derivation of perturbative information is that number of massive
elds giving contributions to renormalization of the given eld should be nite. as was
shown in [33] string theory does fulll this requirement. to calculate function for
any massive eld it is sucient to nd divergences coming only from a nite number of
other massive elds and so it is possible to derive eective equations of motion for any
background elds in any order in .

this procedure have serious limitation  it does not allow to derive non-perturbative
contributions to the string eective action. it is well known that correct terms cubic in
massive elds (quadratic terms in equations of motion) cannot be found within perturba-
tive renormalization of model. for example, perturbative function of tachyon eld
is linear in all orders in  and interacting tachyonic terms are due to non-perturbative
(from the point of view of two dimensional eld theory) eects [40].

to nd these non-perturbative contribution one should use the method exact renor-
malization group (erg) [41][43]. it is ideally suited for string theory because, rst of all,
its formulation does not require any a priori dened perturbative scheme, and secondly,
the equations of exact renormalization group are quadratic in interaction terms thus re-
sembling the cubic structure of exact string eld action. but erg method also has a
serious disadvantage as it requires explicit separation of classical action into free and in-
teraction parts and thus leads to non-covariant equations for background elds. from the
general point of view this fact does not contradict general properties of string theory. we
have already mentioned that exact eective action describing both massless and massive
string modes should be non-covariant. but non-covariance of the erg method makes
it rather dicult to establish relations between string elds equations and ordinary eld
theory.

so in this paper we derive covariant equations of motion for massive string elds
interacting with gravity by means of ordinary perturbative analysis of quantum weyl
invariance condition in the corresponding model. of course, perturbatively we can
obtain equations only linear in massive elds. it was noted long ago [16] that one can
make such a eld redenition in the string eective action that terms quadratic in massive
elds (linear terms in equations of motion) acquire dependence on arbitrary higher powers
of massless elds and so may be covariant.
in this paper we explicitly obtain these
interaction terms in the lowest in  approximation. we do not get terms quadratic in
massive elds which should be non-covariant and arise only non-perturbatively.

as a model for our calculations we use bosonic open string theory interacting with
background elds of the massless and the rst massive levels. first massive level con-
tains symmetric second rank tensor and so this model provides the simplest example of
massive higher spin eld interacting with gravity. in order to obtain equations of motion
for string elds we build eective action for the corresponding two dimensional theory,
perform renormalization of background elds and composite operators and construct the
renormalized operator of energy momentum tensor trace.

this rather standard scheme was rst developed for calculations in closed string theory

3

with massless background elds [20, 27, 28] and then was generalized for the open string
theory [44, 46, 47, 48] and for strings in massive elds [33]. the new feature appearing
in open string theory is that the corresponding two dimensional sigma model represents
a quantum eld theory on a manifold with a boundary. to construct quantum eective
action in such a theory we use generalization of schwinger-de witt method for manifolds
with boundaries developed in the series of papers [49].

making perturbative calculations we restrict ourselves to string world sheets with
topology of a disk. the resulting equations of motion for graviton will not contain depen-
dence on massive elds from the open string spectrum because these elds interact only
with the boundary of world sheet and so can not inuence the local physics in the bulk.
for example, in the case of graviton and massive elds from the open string spectrum
one expects that equations of motion for the graviton should look like ordinary vacuum
einstein equations without any matter. of course, one can obtain contributions from
open string background elds to the right hand side of einstein equations for gravity but
it would demand considering of world sheets of higher genus [45, 47].

the organization of the paper is as follows. in the sec. 2 we describe the most gen-
eral consistent equations of motion for massive spin 2 eld on a specic class of curved
manifolds from the point of view of ordinary eld theory and generalize them for the
interaction with scalar dilaton eld in the sec. 3. in the next section we show how the
scheme can be generalized to the case of arbitrary gravitational background by means of
either non-lagrangian equations or equations representing innite series in inverse mass.
sec. 5 contains description of the string model that we use for derivations of eective
equations of motion of string massive elds. we calculate divergences of the theory in
the lowest order, carry out renormalization of background elds and composite operators
and construct the renormalized operator of the energy-momentum tensor trace. require-
ment of quantum weyl invariance leads to eective string elds equations of motion. we
compare with each other equations of motion derived in two previous sections and show
that string theory gives (at least in the lowest order) consistent equations for the spin 2
massive eld interacting with gravity. conclusion contains summary of the results.

2 massive spin 2 eld coupled to gravity in eld the-

ory

in this section we give detailed analysis of the lagrangian formulation for the free spin 2
massive eld and then generalize it for the presence of external gravitational eld. the
rst requirement one should impose on such a theory is preservation of the same number of
degrees of freedom and constraints as in the at theory. another important feature of any
consistent relativistic theory is causality, which means that the equations of motion should
not describe superluminal propagation [13] (see also [14] for a review). the result obtained
in this section is a lagrangian which depends on one arbitrary dimensionless parameter of

4

non-minimal coupling and describes consistent propagation of the spin 2 massive eld in
arbitrary einstein spacetime, i.e. it contains the same number of lagrangian constraints
as in the at spacetime and does not violate causality.

in the at spacetime the massive spin 2 eld is described (as follows from the analysis
of irreducible representations of 4-dimensional poincare group) by symmetric transversal
and traceless tensor of the second rank h satisfying mass-shell condition:

(cid:16)2  m2(cid:17)h = 0,

h = 0,

h 

 = 0.

(1)

in higher dimensional spacetimes poincare algebras have more than two casimir operators
and so there are several dierent spins for d > 4. talking about spin 2 massive eld in
arbitrary dimension we will mean, as usual, that this eld by denition satises the same
equations (1) as in d = 4. after dimensional reduction to d = 4 such a eld will
describe massive spin two representation of d = 4 poincare algebra plus innite tower of
kaluza-klein descendants.

the most convinient approach to building interacting eld theories is a lagrangian one
and, in fact, the general point of view is that any consistent equations of motion should
follow from some classical action. in the case of the free massive spin 2 eld it is well
known that all the equations (1) can be derived from the fierz-pauli action [11]:

s = z ddx(cid:26) 1

the general scheme of calculating the complete set of constraints in lagrangian for-
malism [50] is equivalent to the dirac-bergmann procedure in hamiltonian formalism and
in the case of second class constraints (which is relevant for massive higher spin elds)
consists in the following steps. if in a theory of some set of elds a(x), a = 1, . . . , n the
original lagrangian equations of motion dene only r < n of the second time derivaties
(accelerations) a then one can build n  r primary constraints, i.e.
linear combi-
nations of the equations of motion that does not contain accelerations. requirement of
conservation in time of the primary constraints either dene some of the missing accel-
erations or lead to new (secondary) constraints. then one demands conservation of the
secondary constraints and so on, until all the accelerations are dened and the procedure
closes up.

applying this procedure to the action (2) one can see that the equations of motion

e = 2h  2h + h + h  h 

  h 



 m2h + m2h = 0

contain d primary constraints (expressions without second time derivatives h):

e00 = hii  ijhij  m2hii  (1)
e0i = h0i + i hkk  k hki  ikh0k  m2h0i  (1)

0  0

i  0.

(4)

(5)

the remaining equations of motion eij = 0 allow to dene the accelerations hij in terms
h and h. the accelerations h00, h0i cannot be expressed from the equations
of
directly.

conditions of conservation of the primary constraints in time e0  0 lead to d

secondary constraints. on-shell they are equivalent to

conservation of (2)
another one constraint.
suitable terms proportional to the equations of motion:

i

(2)
 = e = m2h  m2h  0
denes d  1 accelerations h0i and conservation of (2)
gives
it is convenient to choose it in the covariant form by adding

(6)

(3) = e +

d  2

e = hm4 d  1

d  2  0

conservation of (3) gives one more constraint on initial values

(4) =  h00 + hkk = h  0

(7)

(8)

and from the conservation of this last constraint the acceleration h00 is dened.

altogether there are 2d+2 constraints on the initial values of h and h. the theory
contains the same local dynamical degrees of freedom as the system (1) and describes
traceless and transverse symmetric tensor eld of the second rank.

now if we want to construct a theory of massive spin 2 eld on a curved manifold
rst of all we should provide the same number of propagating degrees of freedom as in
the at case. it means that new equations of motion e should lead to exactly 2d + 2
constraints and in the at spacetime limit these constraints should reduce to their at
counterparts. in addition to consistency with the at space limit any eld theory should
possess one more crucial property connecting with causal propagation [13, 14]. in general
case interaction with external elds changes light cones describing propagation of spin 2
massive eld [1] so causality may give another restrictions on the theory.

generalizing (2) to curved spacetime we should substitute all derivatives for the co-
variant ones and also we can add non-minimal terms containing curvature tensor with
some dimensionless coecients in front of them. as a result, the most general action for
massive spin 2 eld in curved spacetime quadratic in derivatives and consistent with the
at limit should have the form [1]:

contain second time derivatives of h in the following way:

e00 = (gmn  g00g00gmn + g00g0mg0n)00hmn + o(0),

i )00hmn + o(0),
j  gijg00gmn + gijg0mg0n)00hmn + o(0).

(10)

(11)

so we see that accelerations h00 and h0i again (as in the at case) do not enter the
equations of motion while accelerations hij can be expressed through h, h and their
spatial derivatives.

there are d linear combinations of the equations of motion which do not contain

second time derivatives and so represent primary constraints of the theory:

(1)
 = e0

 = g00e0 + g0jej

(12)

now one should calculate time derivatives of these constraints and dene secondary ones.
in order to do this in a covariant form we can add to the time derivative of (1)
 any linear
combination of equations of motion and primary constraints. so we choose the secondary
constraints in the following way:

(2)

(13)

at the next step conservation of these d secondary constraints should lead to one new
constraint and to expressions for d 1 accelerations h0i. this means that the constraints
(13) should contain the rst time derivatives h0 through the matrix with the rank d 1:

(17)

at this stage the restrictions that consistency imposes on the non-minimal couplings
and on the external gravitational eld reduce to the requirements that the above matrix
elements give det  = 0 while det di

one way to fulll these requirements is to impose the following restriction on the

external gravitational elds:

r =

(18)

it means that one considers only einstein spacetimes [53] representing solutions of vacuum
einstein equations with cosmological constant. in these spacetimes the scalar curvature
r is constant as follows from the bianchi identity r = 1
2r but the weyl tensor
part of the curvature tensor can be arbitrary.

if the einstein equation (18) for external gravity is fullled the coecients a4, a5 in

the lagrangian (9) are absent and the matrix  takes the form:

in the at case - the symmetric, covariantly transverse and traceless tensor. d primary
constraints guarantees conservation of the transversality conditions in time.

now we turn to the discussion of causality for the spin 2 eld equations. analogous
problem with dynamical gravity was investigated in [1] (see also [13, 14] for causality
problem in electromagnetic background). in general, when one has a system of dierential
equations for a set of elds b (to be specic, let us say about second order equations)

mab

b + . . . = 0,

,  = 0, . . . , d  1

(29)

the following denitions are used. a characteristic matrix is the matrix function of d
arguments n built out of the coecients at the second derivatives in the equations:
nn. a characteristic equation is det mab(n) = 0. a characteristic
mab(n) = mab
surface is the surface s(x) = const where s(x) = n.

if for any ni (i = 1, . . . , d1) all solutions of the characteristic equation n0(ni) are real
then the system of dierential equations is called hyperbolic and describes propagation of
some wave processes. the hyperbolic system is called causal if there is no timelike vectors
among solutions n of the characteristic equations. such a system describes propagation
with a velocity not exceeding the speed of light. if there exist timelike solutions for n
then the corresponding characteristic surfaces are spacelike which violates causality.

in the at spacetime the equations for the spin 2 eld (1) lead to the characteristic

equation

det m(n) = (n2)d(d+1)/2

which has 2 multiply degenerate roots:

(30)

(31)

0 + n2

i = 0,

 n2

n0 = qn2

i .

the solutions for n are real and null hence the equations are hyperbolic and causal.

now consider the curved spacetime generalization. if we tried to use the equations of

motion in the original lagrangian form (23) then the characteristic matrix

m

(n) = ()

()n2  ggn2 + gnn + gnn  (

 n)n  (

 n)n

would be degenerate. this fact can be seen from the relation

nm

(n)  0

(32)

(33)

which means that any symmetric tensor of the form n(t) (with t an arbitrary vector)
represents a null vector for the matrix m(n) and therefore det m = 0.

after having used the constraints we obtain the equations of motion written in the

form (28) and the characteristic matrix becomes non-degenerate:

m

(n) = 

n2,

n2 = gnn.

(34)

the characteristic cones remains the same as in the at case. at any point x0 we can
choose locally g(x0) =  and then

n2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0

= n2

0 + n2
i

10

(35)

just like in the at case the equations are hyperbolic and causal.

so we demonstrated that in einstein spacetimes spin 2 massive eld can be consistently
described by a one-parameter family of theories (22). for any value of the parameter
the corresponding equations describe the correct number of degrees of freedom which
propagate causally. our lagrangian for the spin 2 eld in curved spacetime is the most
general known so far, in all previous works only the theories with specic values of the
parameter  were considered [3, 5].

the next natural step would consist in building a theory describing dynamics of both
gravity and massive spin 2 eld. in such a theory in addition to dynamical equations for
the massive spin 2 eld one would have dynamical equations for gravity with the energy-
momentum tensor constructed out of spin 2 eld components. the analysis of consistency
then changes and one needs to have correct number of constraints and causality for both
elds interacting with each other [1].

the only known consistent system of a higher spin eld interacting with dynamical
gravity is the theory of massless helicity 3/2 eld, i.e. supergravity [51] (see also the book
[52]). in that case consistency with dynamical gravity requires four-fermion interaction.
if a consistent description of spin 2 eld interacting with dynamical gravity exists it may
also require some non-trivial modication of the lagrangian. at least, it is known that
lagrangians quadratic in spin 2 eld do not provide such a consistency [1]. in the section 4
we will describe a possible way of consistent description of the spin 2 eld on arbitrary
gravitational background which is given by representation of the lagrangian in the form
of innite series in inverse mass.

3 coupling to background scalar eld

now we investigate a possibility to generalize the above analysis for the case of spin 2
massive eld interacting not only with background gravity but also with a scalar dilaton
eld. this set of elds arises naturally in string theory which contains dilaton eld (x)
as one of its massless excitations.

writing a general action similar to (22) for this system one should take into account
all possible new terms with derivatives of (x) and also containing arbitrary factors f ()
without derivatives of the dilaton elds. for example, string eective action can contain
in various terms the factors ek, k = const. we will consider here the class of actions for
the eld h where all these factors can be absorbed to the metric g by a conformal
rescaling.

the most general action of this type is

where sg is the general action without dependence on scalar eld (9) and s can contain

s = sg + s,

(36)

11

(up to total derivatives) ten new terms:

s = z ddxg(cid:26)c1

we consider  as a background eld on the same footing with the metric g.

what values of coupling parameters c1, . . . , c10 are permissible and how does the con-
dition on the background (18) change in the presence of ? to answer these questions
one should repeat the analysis of the previous section for the action (36) calculating all
constraints of the theory.

the equations of motion are:

introducing of background dilaton does not change the second derivatives terms in
  0 are again primary constraints. conditions of their

conservation should give d secondary constraints:

(c3  c6 + c4  c5)g00i(g00 h00 + 2g0j h0j) + . . .
2

hence we should impose the restriction

c3  c6 + c4  c5 = 0.

(39)

(40)

in order to cancel second time derivatives in (2)
 . note that without dilaton couplings
these expressions do not contain second derivatives at all and represent constraints for
any values of non-minimal couplings with gravity (12).

we will restrict ourselves to even simpler particular class of the theories with

c3 = c6,

c4 = c5.

(41)

then the secondary constraints contain rst time derivatives of h0 with the following
coecients (14):

here f  and f are functions of the scalar eld  and its derivatives, we will not write the
explicit form of them here. the important fact about this constraint is that it does not
contain the time derivative of the eld component h00. hence, the conservation condition
(3)  0 does not contain the acceleration h00 and leads to another one constraint (4)
providing thus the correct total number of constraints in the theory. the acceleration h00
is dened only from the condition (4)  0. for any values of the coupling parameters
the theory (44) describes correct number of degrees of freedom.

causality in presence of dilaton may be violated even in the at spacetime. it follows
 and (3) cannot be solved algebraically
from the fact that in general the constraints (2)
with respect to the trace h and the longitudinal part h and used for cancelling the
corresponding terms in the equations of motion. as a result, the characteristic matrix
diers signigantly from its at counterpart and the characteristic equation may pos-
sess new non-trivial solutions spoiling causality for some values of the parameters , .
we postpone a detailed study of the causality in the presence of dilaton for a separate
publication.

in the rest of the paper we will be considering only pure gravitational background

when the scalar eld  is absent.

4 consistent equations in arbitrary background

in previous sections we analyzed a possibility of consistent description of the spin 2 eld
on arbitrary einstein manifold. now we will describe another possibility which allows to
remove any restrictions on the external gravitational background by means of considering
a lagrangian in the form of innite series in inverse mass m. existence of dimensionful
mass parameter m in the theory let us construct a lagrangian with terms of arbitrary
orders in curvature multiplied by the corresponding powers of 1/m2:

(46)

actions of this kind are expected to arise naturally in string theory where the role of mass
parameter is played by string tension m2 = 1/ and perturbation theory in  will give
for background elds eective actions of the form (46) 2.

possibility of constructing consistent equations for massive higher spin elds as series
in curvature was recently studied in [6] where such equations were derived in particular
case of symmetrical einstein spaces in linear in curvature order.

here we will demonstrate that requirement of consistency with the at spacetime
limit can be fullled perturbatively in 1/m2 for arbitrary gravitational background at
least in the lowest order. we will use the same general scheme of calculating lagrangian
constraints as in the previous sections. the only dierence is that each condition will be
considered perturbatively and can be solved separately in each order in 1/m2.

primary constraints in the theory described by the action (46) should be given by the
equations e0
  0. requirement of absence of second time derivatives in these equations
will give some restrictions on coecients in higher orders in 1/m2, for example, in terms
like rhh.

secondary constraints in the lowest order in 1/m2 were already calculated in the sec-
tion 2 (13). consistency with the at spacetime limit requires existence of one additional
constraint among conservation conditions of these secondary constraints. so we should
calculate the rank of the matrix

(47)



 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

a bj
ci di

j (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

with the elements in the lowest order given by (17). the advantage of having a theory
in the form of innite series consists in the possibility to calculate the determinant of the
above matrix perturbatively in 1/m2. assuming that the lower right subdeterminant of
the matrix is not zero (it is not zero in the at case) one has

det  = (a  bd1c) det d ,

det d 6= 0

converting the matrix d perturbatively

1

d1 = 

m2g00 j

i + o(cid:18) 1
m4(cid:19)

we get

a  bd1c = rg002(a1 + a2) + r00(2a4 + 2a5  1) + o(cid:18) 1
m2(cid:19)

(48)

(49)

(50)

so consistency with the at limit imposes at this order in m2 two conditions on the ve
non-minimal couplings in the lagrangian (46) and we are left with a three parameters

2in fact, string theory should lead to even more general eective actions than (46) since in the higher

 corrections higher derivatives of all background elds should appear.

can add spatial derivatives of the secondary constraints  ie:

derivatives of the eld h enter this expression in such a way that it does not contain
the accelerations h00, h0 and the velocity h00. this velocity does not appear in (55)
after excluding the accelerations hij because the equations of motion do not contain h00
either. it means that just like in the at case the conservation condition (3)  0 leads to

total number of constraints coincides with that in the at spacetime.

m2(cid:17),

(2)

  h + o(cid:16) 1
m2(cid:17)

(56)

and used for simplifying the form of the original equations of motion. it is convenient to
take these equations in the following linear combination which does not contain the term

. we see that even in this lowest order in m2
and also by the d primary constraints e0
not all non-minimal terms in the equations are arbitrary. consistency with the at limit
leaves only three arbitrary parameters while the number of dierent non-minimal terms
in the equations is four.

however, if gravitational eld is also subject to some dynamical equations of the form
r = o(1/m2) then the system (58) contains only one non-minimal coupling in the
lowest order





2h  m2h + (3 + 2)r

m2(cid:17) = 0,

m2(cid:17) = 0,

(59)

and is consistent for any its value.

17

requirement of causality does not impose any restrictions on the couplings in this
order. the characteristic matrix of (58) is non-degenerate, second derivatives enter in the
same way as in the at spacetime, and hence the light cones of the eld h described
by (58) are the same as in the at case. propagation is causal for any values of 1, 2,
in higher orders in 1/m2 situation becomes more complicated and we expect that
3.
requirement of causality may give additional restrictions on the non-minimal couplings.
concluding this section we would like to stress once more that the theory (52) admits
any gravitational background and so no inconsistencies arise if one treats gravity as dy-
namical eld satisfying einstein equations with the energy - momentum tensor for the
eld h. the action for the system of interacting gravitational eld and massive spin 2
eld and the einstein equations for it are:

s = se + sh,

gr = d2t h
,

r

(60)

with sh given by (52). however, making the metric dynamical we change the structure
of the second derivatives by means of nonminimal terms  rhh which can spoil causal
propagation of both metric and massive spin 2 eld [1]. this will impose extra restrictions
on the parameters of the theory. also, one can consider additional requirements the theory
should fulll, e.g. tree level unitarity of graviton - massive spin 2 eld interaction [4].

5 open string theory in background of massive spin

2 eld

in this section we will consider sigma-model description of an open string interacting
with two background elds  massless graviton g and second rank symmetric tensor
eld h from the rst massive level of the open string spectrum. we will show that
eective equations of motion for these elds are of the form (59) and explicitly calculate
the coecient 3 in these equations in the lowest order in .

(61)

here ,  = 0, . . . , d  1; a, b = 0, 1 and we introduced the notation x = dx
edt . the rst
term s0 is an integral over two-dimensional string world sheet m with metric gab and the
second si represents a one-dimensional integral over its boundary with einbein e. we work
in euclidian signature and restrict ourselves to at world sheets with straight boundaries.
it means that both two-dimensional scalar curvature and extrinsic curvature of the world
sheet boundary vanish and we can always choose such coordinates that gab = ab, e = 1.

theory has two dimensionful parameters.  is fundamental string length squared, d-
dimensional coordinates x have dimension . another parameter  carries dimension
of inverse length in two-dimensional eld theory (61) and plays the role of renormalization
scale. it is introduced in (61) to make the background eld h dimensionless. in fact,
power of  is responsible for the number of massive level to which a background eld
belongs because one expects that open string interacts with a eld from n-th massive
level through the term

n() n+1

2 zm

edt x1 . . . xn+1h1...n+1(x)

the action (61) is non-renormalizable from the point of view of two-dimensional quan-
tum eld theory. inclusion of interaction with any massive background produces in each
loop an innite number of divergencies and so requires an innite number of dierent
massive elds in the action. but massive modes from the nth massive level give vertices
proportional to n and so they cannot contribute to renormalization of elds from lower
levels. of course, this argument assumes that we treat the theory perturbatively dening
propagator for x  only by the term with graviton in (61). now we will use such a scheme
to carry out renormalization of (61) dropping all the terms o(2).

varying (61) one gets classical equations of motion with boundary conditions:

higher massive levels do not inuence the renormalization of any given eld from the lower

massive levels and so the result (71) represents the full answer for perturbative one-loop
renormalization of g and h.

now to impose the condition of weyl invariance of the theory at the quantum level

we should calculate the trace of energy momentum tensor in d = 2 +  dimension:

t (z) = gab(z)

h x x.

divergencies in vacuum expectations values of the operators

< h x x >= r dx es[x]h x x

r dx es[x]

(73)

are calculated by standard background eld method with the use of normal coordinates
(63) as quantum elds.

in the one loop approximation it is enough to expand the composite operator and the
action in (73) up the to second order in normal coordinates and we neglect the terms
more than linear in h as giving only contributions to renormalization of higher massive
levels:

< x xh > = x xh(x)+ <  >0 x x(cid:18)1

where (. . .)0 and [. . .] stands for bare and renormalized operators respectively. expressing
bare values of background eld
h  in terms of the renormalized ones (71) we nally see
that in the lowest order in  the operator does not receive any renormalization:

terms of order o() arise from the higher loops contributions.

the requirement of quantum weyl invariance tells that all e(x) in (81) should vanish
and so they are interpreted as eective equations of motion for background elds. they
contain vacuum einstein equation for graviton (in the lowest order in ), curved spacetime
generalization of the mass shell condition for the eld h with the mass m2 = ()1 and
d + 1 additional constraints on the values of this elds and its rst derivatives. taking
into account these constraints and the einstein equation we can write our nal equations
arising from the weyl invariance of string theory in the form:





2h + r
h 
h + o() = 0,
r + o() = 0.

they coincide with the equations found in the previous section (59) with the value of
non-minimal coupling 3 = 1.
in fact, einstein equations should not be vacuum ones but contain dependence on the
eld h through its energy - momentum tensor t h
. our calculations could not produce
this dependence because such dependence is expected to arise only if one takes into account
string world sheets with non-trivial topology and renormalizes new divergencies arising
from string loops contribution [45, 47].

 can

in order to determine whether the equations (82) can be deduced from an eective
lagrangian (and to nd this lagrangian) one would need two-loop calculations in the string
sigma-model. two-loop contributions to the weyl anomaly coecients e(i) are necessary
because the eective equations of motion (81,82) are not the equations directly following
from a lagrangian but some combinations of them similar to (58). in order to reverse the
procedure of passing from the original lagrangian equations to (58) one would need the
next to leading contributions in the conditions for h and h (82).

6 conclusion

let us summarize the obtained results. we investigated the problem of consistency of
the equations of motion for spin-2 massive eld in curved spacetime and found that two
dierent description of this eld are possible. first, for gravitational background satisfying
vacuum einstein equations (18) one can build an action leading to consistent equations
including the tracelessness and transversality conditions. of course, such gravitational
backgrounds include all popular vacuum solutions of einstein equations such as constant
curvature spacetimes, schwarzschild solution, plane waves etc. it would be interesting to
investigate properties of the massive spin 2 eld dynamics on these specic exact solutions.
another possibility (naturally arising in string theory) consists in building the theory
as perturbation series in inverse mass.
in the lowest order no problems of consistency
with the at space limit and causality arise and equations of motion have the form (58).
then we calculated the equations for the massive spin-2 background eld arising in
sigma model approach to string theory from the condition of quantum weyl invariance
in the lowest order in . the explicit form of the derived equations (82) appears to be
a particular case of the general equations in eld theory (58). we expect that in general
in each order in  the situation remains the same and it is possible to construct the
part of string eective action quadratic in massive background eld which should lead to
generalized mass-shell, tracelessness and transversality conditions.

23

to determine this part of the bosonic string eective action completely one should also
consider other massless background eld including the dilaton (x) and antisymmetric
tensor b(x). inclusion of dilaton will require investigation of strings with curved world
sheets and with non-vanishing extrinsic curvature on the boundary which complicates
the sigma-model calculations.
interaction with massless antisymmetric tensor will be
especially interesting in presence of a d-brane because such a system is a source of non-
commutative geometry in string theory (see [54] and references therein). in the limit when
components of b along the brane are large there should arise some non-commutative
counterpart of the spin two massive eld theory and we hope to derive its explicit form
in the future.

also it would be interesting to repeat our analysis in the case of closed string which
contains the fourth rank tensor at the lowest massive level. from the eld theoretical
point of view investigation of such higher spin elds interacting with gravity will require
to generalize analysis made in the section 2 to the case of arbitrary spin elds whose
dynamics is governed by more complex lagrangians with auxiliary elds [12]. we leave
this investigation for the future work.
