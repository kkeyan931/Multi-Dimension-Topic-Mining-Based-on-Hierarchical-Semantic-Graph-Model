abstract

we provide a realization of the ads2/cft1 correspondence in terms of
asymptotic symmetries of the ads2s1 and ads2s2 geometries arising in
near-extremal btz and reissner-nordstrom black holes. cardys formula
exactly accounts for the deviation of the bekenstein-hawking entropy from
extremality. we also argue that this result can be extended to more general
black holes near extremality.

1 introduction

since the discovery of the thermodynamical properties of black holes a crucial
open problem has been to nd a microscopical structure responsible for the
bekenstein-hawking entropy. in the last few years this question has started
to receive some answers. the discovery of d-branes led to an explicit statis-
tical derivation of the black hole entropy for extremal [1] and near-extremal
[2] black holes (see also the reviews [3, 4]). in a dierent context, strominger
has proposed [5] a unied way to account for the bekenstein-hawking en-
tropy of black holes whose near-horizon geometries are locally similar to the
btz black holes [6]. the idea of the approach of [5] is that a conformal
symmetry of the gravity theory can control the asymptotic density of states,
irrespective of the details of quantum gravity theory, thus providing a sta-
tistical explanation to the area formula for the entropy and, in turn, a sort
of universality. stromingers argument is based in the holographic relation,
rst discovered by brown and henneaux [7], between gravity on ads3 and a
two-dimensional conformal eld theory on the boundary. ads3 gravity pos-
sesses a set of asymptotic symmetries closing down two copies of the virasoro
algebra with central charge c = 3
2g , where g is newtons constant and 1/2
is the cosmological constant. using cardys formula [8] for the boundary
cft2 one reproduces the expected entropy. however, the validity of cardys
formula requires that the lowest eigenvalues of the virasoro operators l0
and l0 vanish. as it has been pointed out in [9], this is not the case of the
boundary theory of ads3 gravity, because it is, up to global issues, liouville
theory [10]. the asymptotic level density of states is then controlled by the
eective central charge [11] which, for liouville theory, turns out to be equal
to one and therefore cannot properly account for the entropy. however, the
fact that the entropy ts cardys formula with the ordinary central charge
seems to indicate that gravity theory itself can provide relevant information
about the microscopic theory, but apparently not enough to characterise it
completely. interesting attempts to avoid the restrictions of 2+1 dimensions
to explain the bekenstein-hawking entropy by means of symmetry principles
has been given in [12, 13, 14] by considering the horizon as a boundary.

among the family of adsd/cftd1 dualities [15], the pure gravity case
ads3/cft2 is the best understood. in contrast, the ads/cft correspon-
dence in two space-time dimensions is quite enigmatic. some progress has
been made in [16, 17, 18, 19]. one of the aims of this paper is to further inves-
tigate the ads2/cft1 correspondence in terms of asymptotic symmetries. in

1

section 2 we shall analyse the relation between the rst sub-leading terms in
the asymptotic expansion of the metric eld, obeying suitable ads2 boundary
conditions, and the stress tensor of the boundary theory, as happen in higher
dimensional situations [20, 21]. following a similar line of reasoning as in
[5] we shall show that the application of cardys formula to the unique copy
of the virasoro algebra emerging as an asymptotic symmetry, yields to the
entropy of spinless btz black holes. but more interestingly, the ads2/cft1
correspondence, implemented via asymptotic symmetries, can be used to
correctly account for the deviation of the bekenstein-hawking entropy from
extremality in the near-horizon approximation. on general grounds, two-
dimensional anti-de sitter space naturally arises in the near-horizon limit
around the degenerate radius of coincident horizons [22]. therefore, a way
to study maldacenas duality in d=2 and its implication for black holes
is to consider gravity theories having black hole solutions with degenerate
horizons.
in section 3 we consider near-extremal btz black holes and in
section 4 four-dimensional reissner-nordstrom black holes near extremality.
finally, in section 5 we show that the above results can be extended to any
black hole with degenerate horizons that can be properly described by a
two-dimensional eective theory.

2 dimensional reductions of ads3 gravity and

the ads2/cft1 correspondence

einstein gravity on ads3 is described by the action

s =

16gz d3xg(r +

2 )

(2.1)

and we can dimensionally reduce the theory [23, 24] via a decomposition of
the metric of the form

ds2

(3) = gdxdx + 22(x)(d + a(x)dx)2 ,

,  = 0, 1

(2.2)

where ds2 = gdxdx is a two-dimensional metric,  a scalar (dilaton)
eld and a a kaluza-klein u(1) gauge eld. the two-dimensional eective
theory is governed by the action

where x = x0  x1 and f+ = +a  a+. moreover, by varying the
dilaton one obtains

and using (2.4) one gets

r =

(2.6)

where j is related with the integration constant of (2.4). the action (2.3)
turns out to be then

the most general solution of (2.7) with a linear dilaton corresponds to the
dimensional reduction of the btz black hole which, in the schwarzschild

theory. to get a two-dimensional ads geometry from (2.6) we have two
dierent ways. we can restrict the theory to the spinless sector j = 0 with

r = 

2
2 ,

(2.13)

or we can x the value of the dilaton in a way consistent with the equation
of motion [22]

where v () is given by (2.8). this implies that the value of the dilaton
 = 0 should be a zero of the potential

 = v () ,

(2.14)

v (0) = 0(cid:18) 2

and then

r = v (0) =

(2.15)

(2.16)

in the remaining part of this section we shall study the rst possibil-
ity, which is equivalent to consider the jackiw-teitelboim model of two-
dimensional gravity [25]. the second way to get an ads2 geometry (ads2s1
from the three-dimensional point of view) will be widely analysed in the next
section, although the basic features of the ads2/cft1 correspondence con-
sidered in our approach will be presented here.

the reduced theory with j = 0 coincides with the jackiw-teitelboim

model

with a2 = 8gm. the metrics (2.18) are locally ads2 and in order to dene
a quantum theory we have to specify boundary conditions for the elds at

assume the following asymptotic behaviour of the metric

where we have now introduced the rst sub-leading terms in the expansion
aiming to relate them with a conformal eld on the boundary.

the innitesimal dieomorphisms  a(x, t) preserving the above boundary

conditions are

where t and x are arbitrary functions, one can easily show that the only
gauge invariant quantity is

tt = (tt 

xx
24 ) ,

(2.27)

where  is a constant coecient.

the action of the innitesimal dieomorphism (2.23-2.24) on the metric

induces the following transformation for the function tt:
tt + 2tt(t)  2(t) .

tt = (t)

(2.28)

so, the quantity tt behaves as the (chiral component of the) stress tensor of
a conformal eld theory. to evaluate the central charge we need to know the

these boundary conditions where rst introduced in [18].

coecient . to this end we have to work out the noether charges associated
to the above asymptotic symmetries. using the decomposition of the metric

ds2 = n 2dt2 + 2(dx + n xdt)2 ,

the bulk hamiltonian of the theory is given by

h0 =z dx(nh + n xhx) ,

where the constraints are

and the momenta


h =  + (

hx =

) 


2 ,

 = n 1(1 + (n x)) ,
 = n 1(  + n x) .

the full hamiltonian is given by

h = h0 + k ,

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)
(2.34)

(2.35)

where k is a boundary term necessary to have well-dened variational deriva-
tives. assuming the boundary condition for the dilaton

(2.36)

and imposing that k vanishes for a2 = 0, the boundary term k can be

using the asymptotic expansion for the metric and the dilaton we obtain

(2.38)

(2.39)

k() =

(2.41)

the standard identication of k() in terms of the stress tensor [26]

allows us to know the coecient , which turns out to be

k() = tt

we still have to compute the central charge. dening the fourier components

(2.44)

where we assume periodicity of t in the interval 0  t < 2, the poisson

(2.45)

where m = eimt/. using (2.28) it is easy to get the following virasoro

and, in terms of the mass a2 = 8gm, we have

(2.49)

observe that to have a virasoro algebra of the neveu-schwartz form we must
shift the ramond-type generator: lr

0 = lr

the results (2.47) and (2.49) allows us to compute the asymptotic density

(2.50)

where  is the eigenvalue of the virasoro generator ln s

,

(2.51)

which coincides with the thermodynamical formula (2.12) with j = 0. we
should stress the fact that, in contrast with the analysis of [18], which uses the
convention 4g = , we have found an exact agreement between the statistical
entropy of the two-dimensional black hole (2.18) and the corresponding 2d
bekenstein-hawking formula. the discrepancy comes from the evaluation of
the central charge. our result is c = 3
g and the authors of [18] claim that
c = 24( 

4g ).

we must stress now the important fact that the statistical entropy is
independent of the length of the interval of the compactied parameter t. if
we choose a dierent periodicity for t: 0 < t < 2, the central charge shift
c  c 
0 , and hence
the entropy, is not sensitive to the compactication scale.

the second possibility to get a ads2 geometry in ads3 gravity is by means of
a constant dilaton solution. this can be obtained performing a perturbation
around the degenerate radius of the extremal solutions, keeping the angular
momentum | j

 |= m0 xed, (see [22] for the general case):

m =| j/ | (1 + k2) ,

(3.1)

where  is an innitesimal parameter 0 <   1 and k is an arbitrary
positive constant. introducing the coordinates (t, x) dened by

,

t =

r = r0 + x ,

(3.2)
where r0 = r+ = r = 2gm0, the solutions (2.9-2.10) have a well-dened
limit when   0:
ds2 = (cid:18)4x2

with a2 = 8m0gk. this way we recover, in the   0 limit, an ads2
geometry with curvature r =  8

and assuming analogous boundary conditions for the asymptotic expansion
of the two-dimensional ads2 metric

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

observe that the modication of the above expression with respect to the
case j = 0 is due to the shift in the two-dimensional curvature, r =  8
instead of r =  2
since the ads2 codies in some sense the black hole geometry in the
near-extremal situation

2 for j = 0.

(3.10)

the idea now is to exploit this feature to explain the near-extremal entropy
in terms of the asymptotic symmetries of ads2. to evaluate the central
charge when we approach to the extremal black hole we have to work out the
noether charges. the calculation is similar to that given in section 2, since
only the derivative term in the action (2.7) is relevant, and it coincides with
that of jackiw-teitelboim theory. therefore, the noether charges, to leading
order in , are

k() = (t)

black holes

in this section we shall generalise the argument leading to the statistical
explanation of the near-extremal bekenstein-hawking entropy of btz and
reissner-nordstrom black holes to a wider family of black holes. we shall
consider a generic black hole solution, in an arbitrary dimension n, which
can be described by the metric

integrating the equations of motion of any abelian gauge eld we can arrive
at an eective two-dimensional theory. an additional conformal rescaling of

form [28, 29]

and working in the gauge tx = 0, the noether charges can be worked out
without diculty because of the simple form of the two-dimensional eective
action (5.2).

tt =

assuming a periodicity of 2 in t, we obtain

applying now cardys formula we get

where h is the value of the dilaton at the outer horizon, we can rewrite

on the other hand, the bekenstein-hawking entropy for the two-dimensional
eective theory is given by the simple expression [29]

6 conclusions and nal remarks

we have shown that the asymptotic symmetries of btz and reissner-nordstrom
extremal black holes, whose near-horizon geometry is ads2sn (n=1,2 re-
spectively) are powerful enough to control the deviation of the bekenstein-
hawking entropy of nearly extremal black holes from the extremal situation.
we have also argued that the above results can be generalised for arbitrary
black holes near extremality if they can be described by an eective two-
dimensional dilaton gravity theory.

our approach is based on a realization of the boundary conformal eld
theory in terms of the sub-leading terms in the asymptotic expansion of
the metric eld. the evaluation of the noether charges associated with the
asymptotic symmetries near extremality allows to compute the central charge
and the value of lr
0 . these values depend on an arbitrary parameter  in such
a way that clr
0 , and hence the statistical entropy, has an absolute meaning
. however, in the present context the physical excitations are associated
to the would-be gauge dieomorphisms characterised by the functions (t)
and these degrees of freedom have an eective central charge cef f = 1 (see
[27]). therefore, it could appear natural to choose  in such a way that c = 1
and bypass the question of the discrepancy between c and cef f . this type
of argument was put forward in 2+1 gravity in [30, 31] and could have some
unexpected consequences.

a similar situation appears in [12, 14]
