abstract

suppose a regularised functional integral depends holomorphically on a pa-
rameter that receives only a nite renormalization. can one expect the corre-
lation functions to retain the analyticity in the parameter after removal of the
cuto(s)? we examine the issue in the sinh-gordon theory by computing the
intrinsic 4-point coupling as a function of the lagrangian coupling . drawing
on the conjectured triviality of the model in its functional integral formulation
for 2 > 8, and the weak-strong coupling duality in the bootstrap formula-
tion on the other hand, we conclude that the operations: removal of the
cuto(s) and analytic continuation in  do not commute.

1. introduction: weak-strong coupling dualities have been a recurrent theme in quantum
eld theory; see e.g. [1] for a review. typically either the weak or the strong coupling
regime admits a controllable series expansion, while the other regime is elusive even
in a non-perturbative formulation, e.g. via a lattice-regularized functional integral. of
course this is what makes the duality interesting in the rst place, but it also presents
a puzzle as to its precise meaning: if the duality is a feature of an already completely
dened theory, one should be able to prove or disprove it,  which appears to be utopian
in most cases. if on the other hand it should be thought of as a denition, supplementing
an incomplete computational scheme, it is hard to see how a non-perturbative functional
integral construction should in principle leave room for such a supplementation.

a mathematically controllable variant of this puzzle occurs in the sinh-gordon theory.
in its bootstrap formulation it is long known to possess a weak-strong coupling duality,
mapping the super-renormalizable 2 < 8 regime into the elusive 2 > 8 one, where 
is the lagrangian coupling. on the other hand there are good reasons to expect the theory
to be trivial, i.e. non-interacting in its functional integral formulation, for 2 > 8.

since triviality can be expressed as the vanishing of the intrinsic 4-point coupling gr, it
is natural to examine the issue in terms of this quantity. in the case at hand gr = gr()
is dened by

gr = 

m 2g(0, 0, 0, 0)

g(0, 0)2

,

(1)

where m is the mass gap and g are the green functions of the fundamental eld . they
are related to the fourier transform of the truncated (connected) euclidean correlation
functions by

h(k1) . . . (kn )it = (2)2(2)(k1 + . . . + kn )g(k1, . . . , kn ) ,

(2)

where k1 + . . . + kn = 0 is understood in the arguments of g. in [2] a technique has
been developed to compute gr non-perturbatively and to high accuracy in any integrable
qft, starting from its exact form factors. later we shall use this technique to compute
gr in the (bootstrap) sinh-gordon model and then return to the above issue. let us rst
however lay out the problem in more detail.

2. triviality versus duality: classically the sinh-gordon model is described by the la-
grangian

l =

2

()2 

m 2
0
2 cosh (x) ,

1

where m0 is a (bare) mass parameter and  a coupling constant. the qft is presumed
to describe the scattering of a single massive stable particle of (physical) mass m. it can
be constructed both via a functional integral formulation and in terms of the form factor
bootstrap. as this will be relevant for the intrinsic coupling we briey review the main
features known or expected to hold in both approaches.

in a functional integral formulation the model can be regularized by wick ordering, say
with respect to a uv regularized free propagator of mass . one can adopt a scheme in
which  is not renormalized and the model is then thought to have a (asymptotic) super-
renormalizable perturbative expansion in , for 2 < 8. one will require that physical
quantities are invariant under the normal-ordering renormalization group, i.e. that they
are annihilated by the dierential operator (/)  (2/8)m0(/m0). in particular
after removal of the cut-o all green functions will be functions of  , m0 and the ratio
/m0, that are invariant in the above sense. moreover one can show (by so-called tadpole
dressing [7, 8]) that the dependence on /m0 enters only through the physical mass m.
the latter, i.e. its relation to the lagrangian parameters is known exactly [9]

m =

( 1

2  b
where b =

4

8 + 2 ,  = m 2

(2b)/4

 ( b
2b )
16( b

2b )#
0  2/4 .

,

(3)

note that  is renormalization group invariant and (2b)/4 = m0(/m0)b/2 produces
the correct mass dimension. as it stands the expression (3) is physically meaningful only
for 0 < 2/8 < 1, though it happens to be real also for 2n < 2/8 < 2n + 1, with n a
positive integer. the eigenvalues of the innite set of higher conserved charges [8] exhibit
the same feature through their dependence on the exact tadpole function (which can be
determined from (3)).

for 2 > 8 the status of the model dened through the functional integral approach is
not rigorously known, however there are good reasons to expect it to be non-interacting.
in particular the intrinsic coupling would then vanish for 2 > 8 when one attempts
to remove the cuto(s). the rationale behind this expectation are the properties of two
closely related models, the liouville model [3] and the sine-gordon model [4], where
constructive qft techniques have been used to derive triviality results for 2 > 8.
specically the methods used for the exponential interaction [3] can be transferred to the
sinh-gordon case and allow to construct the model at least for 2 < 4; for 2 > 0 with
0 probably 8 the infared regularized model is shown to be non-interacting when the

2

ultraviolet cuto is removed. methods of the rigorous renormalization group were used by
dimock and hurd [4] to study the sine-gordon model: their results suggest triviality of
that model for 2 > 8; so far they have not been adapted to the exponential interaction
or the sinh-gordon model.

in the bootstrap approach on the other hand the model is meant to exist and to be in-
teracting for all 0 < 2 < . in particular the intrinsic coupling, which we are going to
compute below, is expected to be non-vanishing for all  6= 0. as usual the bootstrap con-
struction starts from the exact s-matrix. the s-matrix is purely elastic and is postulated
to be [5]

s() =

sh  i sin 
2 b
sh + i sin 
2 b

,

(4)

with b as in (3). the specic dependence on the lagrangian coupling  has been tested
in two-loop perturbation theory [10]. the (relevant) form factors computed from this
s-matrix will be supplied below. both the s-matrix and the form factors are manifestly
invariant under the duality transformation

 

8


or b  2  b ,

(5)

mapping the super-renormalizable regime into the elusive 2 > 8 one. in principle the
green functions can be constructed from the form factors so that the qft dened by the
form factor bootstrap will exhibit the duality (5),  provided the physical mass is declared
to be a nite invariant numerical parameter (unlike (3) which vanishes for 2/8  1).
in quantities like the intrinsic 4-point coupling gr where the mass drops out the latter
problem is absent. in the following we shall compute gr within the form factor bootstrap
and nd it to be duality invariant as expected

gr(b) = gr(2  b) .

(6)

a plot of gr(b) versus b in the bootstrap theory can be found in fig. 1 below.

3. computation of the intrinsic coupling: in principle it seems straightforward to compute
gr from the known form factors of a theory. one simply inserts a resolution of the identity
in terms of scattering states, once for the two-point function and three times for the four-
point function in (2). the technical problem is that a large number of distributional
terms will appear that mask the expected analyticity in the momenta and which also

3

render the expessions rather unwildly. by a careful rearrangement however partial sums
of the distributional terms can be decomposed into a regular term and a singular remainder
whose coecient vanishes identically. in particular the analyticity in the momenta then
becomes visible and the zero momentum limit relevant for (1) can be taken. clearly
gr will decompose in that way into a fourfold innite sum over the phase space of the
inserted multi-particle states. remarkably the dominant term, coming from the 1-particle
form factor contribution in the two-point function and the 1+3-particle contributions in
the 4-point function, typically gives already 98% (!) of the full answer [2]. moreover
for this dominant contribution a general model-independent expression in terms of the
derivative of the s-matrix and the 1-and 3-particle form factors can be obtained. the
general formula can be found in [2]; here we need only the case where the bootstrap s-
matrix s() is scalar, diagonal, and without bound state poles. for the n-particle form
factors of a scalar operator one can then write f (n) = f (n, . . . , 1), where the rapidities
j parameterize the on-shell momenta of the n-particle scattering state. the formula for
the coupling then reads

gr = 12i

here the dots indicate terms coming from n  3-particle contributions to the two-point
function and from the n  5-particle contributions to the 4-point function. further since
gr does not depend on the normalization of f (1) we normalized f (3) relative to f (1)  1.
to evalute (7) we now prepare the relevant form factors. the form factors of the sinh-
gordon model factorize into a universal transcendental function (independent of the local
operator considered) and a polynomial remainder. the universal part is essentially a
product of minimal form factors

fig. 1 shows a plot of gr(b) versus b, which exhibits the announced weak-strong coupling
duality (6). for small b the behavior is linear and the slope can be evaluated analytically

gr = (9/2 + . . .)b + o(b2) .

the dots indicate contributions to the slope coming from the subleading terms in (7).

on the other hand perturbation theory (pt) predicts gr(b)pt = 4b + o(b2), as b =
2/4 + o(4). the leading term in (7) thus gives only a crude approximation to the
slope. of course the series (7) has been designed to rapidly converge pointwise in b, so
misusing it to extract the coecients of an asymptotic expansion in b one cannot expect
the convergence of the coecients to be equally rapid. numerically gr(b) computed via
(13) and gr(b)pt give very similar results for 0 < b < 0.1. in particular a linear t on the
0 < b < 0.1 segment of fig. 1 would give a mock slope close to 4. generally speaking
this illustrates the diculty to extract the coecients of an asymptotic expansion from
numerical data without having some analytical control over the remainders. of course
next-to-leading contributions could in principle be computed, both in (13) and in pt,
but the principle problem would remain. for completeness let us also list the numerical
values for gr(b) in (13) at a few points with b  0.1: gr(0.1) = 1.270, gr(0.25) =
2.725, gr(0.5) = 4.291, gr(0.75) = 5.107, gr(1) = 5.362. guided by the experience with
other models [2] we expect them to amount to about 98% of the exact answer.

4. removal of the cuto(s) versus analytic continuation: let us now return to the re-
lation between the functional integral and the bootstrap formulation of the theory. the
suspected discrepancy in the 2 > 8 behavior is most likely due to the fact that the
operations: removal of the cuto(s) in the moments of the functional measure and
analytic continuation in  do not commute. a useful analogy is the behavior of the
0 dt ettz1+n. ini-
tially dened for re z > 0, they can be analytically extended to re z < 0, and are entire

normalized moments of the euler integral measure, htniz = (z)1r 

due to e. seiler (private communication).

6

functions: htniz = qn1

j=0 (z + j). on the other hand the integral repesentation breaks down
for re z < 0, but can be restored by introducing a cuto. the moments of the regularized
measure

(i.e. a ratio of incomplete gamma functions) then obey

lhtniz,l = htniz ,
lim
lhtniz,l = 0 ,
lim

but

re z < 0 .

(16)

in fact one can imitate this phenomenon in the bootstrap approach to the sinh-gordon
theory by describing it as the l   limit of auxiliary continuum bootstrap models
shgl. this modied bootstrap construction leads to a trivial s-matrix and a vanishing
intrinsic coupling at b = 1. to describe the auxiliary models let bl denote the rst
l + 1 terms in a taylor expansion of b around 2/8 = 0, i.e.

bl = 2(cid:20) b

2  b (cid:16) b

2  b(cid:17)2

+ . . . + ()l(cid:16) b

2  b(cid:17)l+1(cid:21) , b < 1 .

(17)

let sl() denote the bootstrap s-matrix (4) with b replaced by bl. this coupling
dependence of the s-matrix would also pass an l-loop perturbation theory test, taking
for granted that (4) does. in contrast to (4) however one has

lim
b1

sl() = 1 ,

l  1 ,

where sl() =

sh  i sin 
sh + i sin 

2 bl
2 bl

.

(18)

let further shgl denote the qft dened by the form factor bootstrap based on the
s-matrix (18). since the s-matrix is trivial for b  1 one expects the intrinsic coupling
to vanish

lim
b1

gr(b)shgl = 0 ,

l  1 .

(19)

this is supported by the explicit computation. the intrinsic couplings of the shgl models
with l = 1, 4, 17 are shown in fig. 2.

for b > 1 the s-matrix (18) develops a pole in the physical strip and is thus inadequate
in view of (19) it is natural to extend
for the description of a single particle theory.
note that for b  1 the ingredients of the standard bootstrap description degenerate: the s-matrix
develops a pole on the boundary of the physical strip and zamolodchikovs mass function (3) (based on
the thermodynamic bethe ansatz) vanishes.

figure 2: intrinsic coupling for the shgl models with l = 1, 4, 17 in order of increasing
slope at b = 1. the solid line is the b < 1 branch of fig 1.

the bootstrap denition of the shgl theory by taking sl() = 1 for b > 1. for large
l the shgl theory then describes a qft that is practically indistinguishable from the
(standard bootstrap) sinh-gordon theory for b < 1, but which continuously interpolates
to the trivial theory for b > 1. for l   the b < 1 match with the conventional
bootstrap theory becomes exact and the transition to the trivial b > 1 theory becomes
discontinuous. the mechanism is similar to the one in the functional integral approach:
the l   limit and analytic continuation in b do not commute. in particular this
illustrates, by way of an alternative, that nothing in the bootstrap formalism itself enforces
the duality (5), (6). strictly speaking it has the status of a denition.

in summary we arrive at the following scenario: both the functional integral and the
bootstrap approach most likely provide consistent non-perturbative constructions of the
sinh-gordon theory, which for 2 < 8 coincide. each of the construction schemes
suggests a natural way to dene an extension into the 2 > 8 regime, which however
are drastically dierent: trivial in the former and dual to the 2 < 8 theory in the
latter case. the discrepancy can be understood in terms of the non-interchangeability of
a (regularizing) limiting procedure and analytic continuation in .
