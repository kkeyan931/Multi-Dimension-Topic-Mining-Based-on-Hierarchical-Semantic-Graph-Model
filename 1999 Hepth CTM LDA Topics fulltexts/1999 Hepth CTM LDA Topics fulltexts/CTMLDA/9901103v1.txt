abstract

the eects of extra space-time dimensions on the wilsonian eective kahler po-
tential and the perturbative one loop eective kahler potential are determined within
the framework of an abelian gauge theory with n = 2 supersymmetric eld content.
the relation between the kahler metric and the eective gauge couplings which leads
to the absence of radiative corrections to the kahler potential is expressed as a func-
tion of the radius of compactication of a fth dimension. in general, the quantum
corrections to the low energy kahler potential are shown to grow with this radius
reecting the underlying higher dimensional nature of the theory.

1 introduction

as a consequence of the large degree of symmetry present in supersymmetric theories,

the form of their low energy wilsonian eective actions is highly constrained. for

instance, when n = 1 susy is combined with the required holomorphic dependence

on the elds and parameters of a model, the superpotential can be completely (non-

perturbatively) determined even in the presence of strongly interacting gauge elds

[1]. furthermore, for extended n = 2 supersymmetric theories, the entire low energy

action can be constructed in terms of a single holomorphic prepotential. as in the n =

1 superpotential case, this prepotential is exactly determined using the symmetries,

holomorphicity and duality properties of the model in question [2]. the simplest

n = 2 gauge theory consists of an n = 1 u(1) gauge supereld v and its neutral

chiral  and antichiral  supereld n = 2 partners.

in terms of these n = 1

superelds, the low energy eective action has the form

n =2[, , v ] =

here subscripts denote dierentiation with respect to that variable so that, for ex-
d de2v de2v =
ample, f = f . the chiral eld strength is dened by w =  1
 1
the holomorphic prepotential f () then determines the kahler potential k(, ) =
im(f() ) and hence the kahler metric g(, ) = k  = imf as well as the
eective gauge couplings: f , f  . the self-radiative corrections to this general
n = 2 susy abelian gauge theory action were found to vanish [1][3][4].

extra compact space dimensions are a common attribute of many currently pro-

posed fundamental theories. concomitant with these is the tower of kaluza-klein

(k-k) eld excitations whose masses are integer multiples of the inverse compacti-

cation radius r. in models where r is the order of the inverse planck scale or smaller,

the k-k modes unconsequentially decouple from the low energy physics. on the other

1

hand, for radii much larger than the inverse planck scale, low energy physics can be

considerably aected by the propagation of elds into the large radii extra dimensions.

at the very least, theories formulated in higher dimensions tend to have a more diver-

gent short distance behavior which leads to the breakdown of renormalizability. thus

an ultraviolet cuto  is necessary for a consistent interpretation of such eld theories.

for large compactication radii, r > 1, the k-k modes with mass below the cuto

can eect the low energy physics [5]-[9]. the resulting theoretical and phenomeno-

logical consequences include, for example, the possibility of introducing [10]-[13] a

consistent and calculable mechanism of supersymmetry breaking and/or communi-

cating the supersymmetry breaking between dierent four dimensional boundaries

[14][15] and could also be instrumental in the description of the strong coupling limit

of string theory [16]. in addition, their inuence on the running of the gauge coupling

and its eect on the scale of unication has been investigated [17]. it has even been

suggested that they could lead to possible experimentally accessible modications to

gravitational interactions in the millimeter range [18].

in four dimensions, the general low energy action containing terms through two

space-time derivatives for a n = 1 supersymmetric theory with the n = 2 eld

content of an abelian gauge supereld v and a neutral (anti-)chiral eld ( ) , has

the form

1

2 z d s f ( ) w  w 

(1.2)

[, , v ] = z dv k(, ) +

1

2 z dsf ()w w +
+z dsp () +z d s p ( ) + z dv v.

here the kahler potential, k(, ), the eective gauge couplings, f () and f ( ),
and the superpotentials, p () and p ( ), are arbitrary, unrelated functions of their

respective arguments. the linear in v fayet-iliopolous term has an arbitrary coupling

constant, , which as a consequence of gauge invariance is necessarily eld indepen-

dent. independent radiative corrections vanish for the superpotential in accord with

the non-renormalization theorem in this topologically trivial model. likewise, the

fayet-iliopolous term has no independent additive radiative corrections. hence each

of these terms remain zero if they initially vanish. finally, while the eective gauge

2

couplings f () and f ( ) also remain uncorrected, the kahler potential does receive

radiative corrections. setting the fayet-iliopolous terms to zero, these quantum ef-

fects are given by the wilson renormalization group equations (wrge) [19][20][21]
for k, f ( f) and p ( p ) as [3]

where all quantities have been made dimensionless by scaling with the loop momen-
tum cuto , so that, for example k  k/2 and   /. the result was obtained
using the r gauge xing action term

[v ] = z dv ddv d dv

(1.4)

and included all graphical contributions through two space-time derivatives and arbi-

trary powers of the elds. in this simple abelian model, the gauge xing parameter

 receives no radiative corrections nor contributes to the other functions.

since the elds are rescaled according to their wavefunction renormalization in

order to maintain a canonical kinetic energy term as the short distance degrees of

freedom are integrated out of the theory, the chiral eld anomalous dimension  can

be found by evaluating the renormalization group equation for the kahler metric,
g = k , at  = 0 =  where it is normalized as g|=0=  = 1. likewise, the photon
anomalous dimension, v , is secured using the renormalization group equation for f
and f evaluated at zero elds  = 0 =  along with the normalizations f|=0 = 1
f| =0 . so doing, one nds that v = 0 and

if the initial choice of kahler potential and eective gauge coupling satises the n = 2
supersymmetric relation g = f + f, then the anomalous dimension of the chiral eld

3

vanishes and the wilson renormalization group equation for k reduces to that of

naive scaling. there are no radiative corrections to the wilson eective action.

one can also compute the corrections using ordinary perturbation theory. the one

loop correction to the dimensionless eective kahler potential is found to be simply

given by

(1.6)

just as was the case in the wrge analysis, the n = 2 supersymmetric relation
g = f + f leads to no one-loop radiative corrections [1], [24]-[26].

the purpose of this paper is to determine the eects of an extra compact dimen-

sion on the supersymmetric wilsonian eective action as well as its eects on the

perturbative one-loop eective action. starting with an n = 1 susy theory with

a compact fth dimension and fourier expanding the elds over the circular fth

dimension results in the four dimensional theory with the n = 2 susy eld content

of the above described zero mode elds, v, , and , as well as the innite tower of
massive k-k n = 2 susy multiplets, {vn, n, n}, for n any non-zero (positive and
negative) integer. the resultant four dimensional action can thus be written as an

expansion in powers of the k-k tower elds as,

 =

l.



xl=0

(1.7)

here 0 contains zero mode elds only. due to momentum conservation in the di-

rection of the fth dimension, 1 = 0, while 2 contains 2 k-k tower elds, and so

on. we seek to construct the wilson renormalization group equation for the zero

mode eld action, 0[v, , ] after inclusion of the radiative eects of k-k towers. in

addition, the perturbative one loop radiative corrections to 0 will be calculated.

in both cases, the quantum corrections arise from the self-radiative contributions

from 0 as well as from radiative corrections of 2 to 0. in either case, the form of 2

is required for the determination of the quantum corrections. in a complete wilson

renormalization group analysis, the evolution of 2 is determined by itself and 4 and

in turn 4 is determined by contributions from 6 and so on. similarly, higher order

perturbative contributions to 0 come from higher numbers of k-k tower elds in

4

the action. since such an innitely iterative procedure is beyond our calculational

means, we must make additional assumptions regarding the form of the 0 and 2

actions before we can proceed. first of all, we neglect all higher derivative terms

than those appearing in the kinetic energy. this constitutes the next to leading

order in a derivative expansion of the action and allows for the determination of the

anomalous dimensions. it thus constitutes an improvement beyond the local potential

approximation [22] which is possible [23] because the kinetic terms arise from a kahler

potential. thus for 0, we use eq.(1.2) without the fayet-iliopoulos term ( = 0).

a similar form is assumed for the 2 action except that explicit compactied radius

dependent mass terms are included for the n = 2 k-k tower elds. thus we take

terms. it has the property that all modes have the same, isotropic four dimensional

action coecients. even in the large r limit, it is only the terms with momentum in

the fth dimension that are treated anisotropically. of course, this is by no means

a justication of the truncation which can only be achieved by a detailed analysis of

the compactication of the more fundamental susy theory involved. this is quite a

lengthy task and is beyond the scope of this present investigation.

2 the wilson eective kahler potential

the wilson renormalization group equation governing the evolution of the zero mode

kahler potential is determined by integrating out the degrees of freedom with mo-

5

mentum in an innitesimal four dimensional shell about (t) = et. although we

are summing over all k-k modes in this shell, those with mass above the scale (t)

decouple. as the sum over these modes takes place, the action is rescaled according

to the wavefunction renormalization of the elds. fixing the zero eld metric at the
scale (t) to its canonically normalized value of one, g|=0=  = 1, and further rescal-
ing all dimensionful quantities by the appropriate factors of  needed to render them

dimensionless, the wilson renormalization group equation for the zero mode kahler

potential is obtained as

(2.1)

here the dimensionless mass coecient is r = p p  , with r(0) the value of the
dimensionless mass parameter at zero eld, r(0) = r|=0= . the eective gauge
couplings and superpotential remain uncorrected and their wilson renormalization

group equations are once again given in equation (1.3). the sum over the k-k modes

may now be performed yielding

this result can also be obtained directly in ve dimensions by integrating over the

fth dimension momentum variable rather than performing a fourier series.

for r 6= 0, the radiative corrections to the kahler potential do not, in general,
vanish at the four dimensional, n = 2 relation between the metric and eective gauge

coupling. rather one nds that, with r = 0, the logarithm on the right hand side of

equation (2.2) vanishes resulting in no radiative correction to the kahler potential,

k, provided

sinh [r] sinh [rg]

= 1

(2.5)

sinh2(cid:20)rqf + f(cid:21)

when this condition is satised, the wilson renormalization group equation yields

the naive scaling equation for the kahler potential.

the four dimensional n = 2 relation between metric and eective gauge couplings
that leads to the absence of radiative corrections is g = (f + f), which is also the
r  0 limit of equation (2.5). in gure 1, we plot the relation between g and f + f for
dierent compactied radii, r, values which leads to no radiative corrections. we see

that, due to the exponential dependence on r, the no radiative correction condition

quickly deviates from the four dimensional relation and rapidly approaches the ve
dimensional relation. for f + f > 1, the values for g lie on top of the ve dimensional
values within the resolution of the gure for r = 1, 2, 10. for f + f < 1, the curves

for r = 0, 0.1, 0.2 essentially coalesce while those for r = 1, 2, 10 have diering

behavior from each other and from the four dimensional result. in general, for xed
f + f , the radiative corrections vanish for smaller g values than that of the four
dimensional case and even take on exponentially small values, g  2rer(f + f ),
in the strong gauge coupling limit when f + f << 1.

being a trivial theory in four and above dimensions, the zero radiative correction
line is an attractive relation between g and f + f in the sense that the renormalization

it in the infrared at the single trivial point g = 1 and f = 1

(2.8)

for small , g is slightly o the xed relation no radiative correction curve. hence,

writing g = g0 + g, where g0 satises the no radiative correction condition, and

expanding equation (2.5) yields

g =

(2.10)

as the theory ows into the infrared, t > 0, the values of the scaled elds,   et
and   et  become small and all quantities can be expanded in low powers of the
elds. thus for t >> 1,   0 exponentially according to the naive dimension of the

hence all renormalization group trajectories ow towards the no radiative correction

relation as the theory evolves into the infrared, and they meet at the single trivial

(generally we are
considering f 6= 0 6= f. for f = 0 = f , the trivial infrared xed point is simply g = 1.
on the other hand if g = 0, then the action consists only of a free vector supereld,
f = 1/2 = f .)

2 = f as t   .

3 the perturbative eective kahler potential

similar conclusions can also be drawn from a one loop perturbative analysis of the

model given by the action obtained by combining equation (1.2) with  = 0 and

equation (1.8). the one loop correction to the dimensionless eective kahler potential

is found to be

where g, f , f and r are specied dimensionless tree action terms while the integral is

dimension k-k modes propagation has been completely summed over in the loop.
in the four dimensional limit, r  0, with r = 0, the momentum integral can be

(3.3)

this vanishes when g 2qf + f + 1 = 0, which is the identical result as was obtained

in the wilson renormalization group equation analysis. on the other hand, it should

10

be noted that the relation between g and f + f for no radiative corrections in this

perturbative case diers slightly from that obtained in the wilson renormalization

group analysis for moderate values of r. as seen in gure 2, the one loop contributions

to the kahler potential increase rapidly with increasing compactication radius r.

indeed, for large radii the quantum corrections are proportional to r. already for r

values of order 1 there are substantial deviations from the r = 0 result. this is readily

seen by the shape of the curve on each surface corresponding to the perturbative
relation between g and f + f for the absence of radiative corrections. this k1loop = 0
curve is displayed as the darkened solid line in the gure. the grid spacing on the
surface corresponds to 0.2 changes in g and f + f while the shading of the surface
corresponds to changes of 3 in the value of k1loop = 162k1loop. for r = 0,
the k1loop surface is fairly at, going from a minimum of -3 to a maximum value of
+3, corresponding to fairly small radiative corrections to k. as r increases to 1, the
k1loop values range from -4.79 to 5.67 while for r = 2, the k1loop spread in values
is from -7.9 to 10.2. thus the range in k1loop values increases as r increases. for
r = 5, the now quite substantial radiative corrections result in the k1loop surface
ranging from a minimum of -18.3 to a maximum of +24.8.

the eects of large compact dimensions on the kahler potential can be further

demonstrated by considering an explicit tree level potential. in general, the radiative

corrections are small due to the

162 loop factor. as the size of the extra dimension
becomes the inverse of this order, however, the loop corrections become comparable

1

with the tree level expression for the kahler potential. for example, consider the
n = 2 susy holomorphic prepotential f in four dimensions given by

f () =
