the arnold conjecture yields a lower bound to the number of periodic clas-
sical trajectories in a hamiltonian system. here we count these trajectories
with the help of a path integral, which we inspect using properties of the
spectral ow of a dirac operator in the background of a sp(2n ) valued
gauge eld. we compute the spectral ow from the atiyah-patodi-singer
index theorem, and apply the results to evaluate the path integral using lo-
calization methods. in this manner we nd a lower bound to the number of
periodic classical trajectories which is consistent with the arnold conjecture.

periodic classical trajectories are important in a large number of prob-
lems. examples range from classical integrable models where the motion
is a periodic ow on invariant torii, to quantum chaos where the energy
spectrum is computed by the gutzwiller (selberg) trace formula. for non-
integrable models exact analytical results are sparse, and in general even a
classication of trajectories becomes arduous. some 35 years ago arnold
conjectured [1] that in an arbitrary hamiltonian system the number of pe-
riodic classical solutions is bounded from below by the number of critical
points of a function. if the hamiltonian is energy conserving i.e. has no
explicit time dependence, this follows immediately from conventional morse
inequalities since every critical point of the hamiltonian is trivially a pe-
riodic classical solution. but in the general case when the hamiltonian is
explicitly time dependent so that energy is not conserved, the conjecture
has only been veried in special cases. the modern approach to the arnold
conjecture is due to floer [2] who formulated it using innite dimensional
morse theory. his approach has led to extensive investigations [3] and appli-
cations in seemingly disparate subjects, most notably topological quantum
eld theories and strings [4].

here we shall study relations between the arnold conjecture and canon-
ical path integrals. we suggest an intuitive approach for proving the conjec-
ture using path integral localization techniques. our arguments are based on
methods of topological quantum eld theories and properties of spectral ow
in a 1+1 dimensional dirac operator in the background of an adiabatically
varying sp(2n ) valued classical gauge eld. for this we consider hamil-
tons equation of motion on a 2n -dimensional phase space i.e. a symplectic
manifold  with local coordinates xi,

xi = ijjh(x, t)  x i

h(x, t)

(1)

here h(x, t) is in general an explicitly time dependent hamiltonian and
xh(x, t) is the corresponding hamiltonian vector eld. the antisymmetric
ij = {xi, xj} is the matrix inverse of the symplectic two-form  = 1
2 ijdxi
dxj on . the solutions of (1) are critical points of the classical action

s = z dthi xi  h(x, t)i

1

(2)

where  is the symplectic potential, ij = ij  ji. for a t -periodic
hamiltonian h(x, t) = h(x, t + t ) dened on a compact  the arnold
conjecture states that the number of non-degenerate and contractible t -
periodic solutions is bounded from below by the sum of the betti numbers
bp on ,

#{t  periodic solutions}  x bp

(3)

when the t-dependence of h is trivial (3) reduces to the conventional nite
dimensional morse inequality [5] since every critical point of h is trivially t -
periodic. but for a generic t-dependent hamiltonian (3) remains unproven.

the number of t -periodic solutions is counted by the path integral

z = xs=0

1 = z dx (cid:20) s
x(cid:21) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

det" 2s
x2#(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(4)

where we have the determinant of the hessian

2s

xi(t1)xj (t2)

= (cid:26)ijt1 +

1
2

(jik + ijk) xk  ijh(cid:27) (t1  t2) (5)

which is a symmetric rst-order dierential operator. the zero-modes of
(5) are jacobi elds, but we assume that the t -periodic solutions of (1)
are isolated and non-degenerate so that the jacobi elds are absent. the
diculty in establishing (3) is then due to the absolute signs in (4), alter-
natively due to the rst-order nature of the hessian: the morse index of
(2) coincides with the number of negative eigenvalues of (5). but since the
spectrum of (5) is unbounded from below this number is innite and needs
to be regulated appropriately.

we rst consider (4) without the absolute value. formally, the path

integral then evaluates to the euler characteristic on the loop space l,

z = xs=0

()k = z dx (cid:20) s

x2#
x(cid:21) det" 2s

(6)

where k = 0 or 1 depending on whether the morse index of the pertinent
critical point of s is even or odd, i.e. whether the hessian has an even or
odd number of negative eigenvalues in some proper regularization scheme.

we introduce a commuting lagrange multiplier  and anticommuting ghosts

where we denote by  collectively the t -periodic variables (x, , , ). this
has the structure of a canonical path integral in a graded phase space in
darboux coordinates with poisson brackets

{i, xj} = { i, j} = j

(8)

we note that the lagrange multiplier  provides a realization of derivation
w.r.t. the variable x. similarly we identify   dx, the basis one-forms,
and  is the corresponding basis of contractions. we dene the exterior
derivative in the loop space l

d = z t

(9)

we may view d as a nilpotent brst operator and the action sext in (7) is
a brst commutator,

hiix j

sext = i xi+ i iix i

j = [d, ] = hd, ( xi  x i) ii = ls
(10)
with ls the lie derivative along the loop space vector eld xs = x  xh.
these relations mean that the path integral (7) determines a topological
quantum theory [6].

h

the fradkin-vilkovisky theorem [7] states that (7) is invariant under
an innitesimal variation    +  of the gauge fermion in (10). an
arbitrary innitesimal coordinate transformation x  x = x + (x) in the
original phase space  is an example of such a variation, with

provided we also conjugate the brst operator according to

d  eii

d eii

since this conjugation does not alter the cohomology of d it has no eect on
the path integral, which is left intact. as a consequence we can inspect the
local structure of the path integral by selecting (local) darboux coordinates

is a sp(2n )-valued traceless product of the antisymmetric 1
metric hessian 2h, and the ghost part in (7) simplies into

0 and the sym-

sf = z t

dt (t + a)

(13)

this is reminiscent of a (0+1) dimensional dirac lagrangian in the back-
ground of a gauge eld. indeed, the darboux coordinates are dened only
modulo canonical transformations corresponding to arbitrary t-dependent
conjugations of the symplectic two-form (11) by elements of sp(2n ),

0 = u 1(t)0u (t)

under these sp(2n ) conjugations the anticommuting ghosts transform ac-
cording to

(t)  u (t)(t)
(t)  (t)u 1(t)

(14)

and (13) remains invariant if aj
eld

i(t) transforms like a sp(2n )-valued gauge

a(t)  u (t)a(t)u 1(t) + u (t) u 1(t)

(15)

4

following [8] we introduce

(t) = t exp


t

z0

a(t)dt 


and dene a sp(2n ) gauge transformation with

where a0 is dened by

u (t) = ea0t  (t)

(t ) = exp(a0  t )

(16)

(17)

which is essentially the average of a(t) over the period t . this gauge trans-
formation maps our sp(2n )-valued gauge eld a(t) into the t-independent
average a0,

u (t)a(t)u 1(t) + u (t) u 1(t) = a0

(18)

as a consequence the ghost lagrangian (13) depends only on the t-independent
a0. moreover, if we decompose the t -periodic hamiltonian h(x, t) into its
fourier modes

h(x, t) = h0(x) + xn6=0

hn(x)  exp(

2int

t

)

(19)

where the hn(x) have no explicit t-dependence and h0(x) is the average
of h(x, t) over the period t , we conclude that the gauge transformation
(18) replaces the original hamiltonian h(x, t) by its t-independent average
h0(x) in the ghost lagrangian (13).

in the following we shall assume that the average h0(x) is a morse

function with only isolated and non-degenerate critical points.

let  denote the original gauge fermion in (10) and let 0 denote the
corresponding gauge fermion with h(x, t) replaced by the average h0(x).
we dene the innitesimal change of variables

   +   {d, } 

t

(  0)

(20)

5

with  an innitesimal parameter. we nd that in (7), (10) the only eect
of (20) is the shift

  (1  ) + 0

and by repeating this change of variables we can replace h(x, t) by h0(x)
in (7). hence (7) depends only on the t-independent average h0(x) of the
hamiltonian.

the hessian (5) has an eigenvalue problem

dfn(t) = nfn(t)

,

fn(0) = fn(t )

(21)

where the eigenvalues n are invariant under sp(2n ) gauge transformations
that are continuously connected to the identity. since we assume that there
are no jacobi elds, in the background of a classical solution all n 6= 0. if
we introduce the -invariant of the hessian

d = lim

s0 xn6=0

sign (n) |n|s

we can remove the absolute value of the determinant in (4) by

(22)

(23)

d(cid:19)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

det[d] (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

this implies that the number of t -periodic classical trajectories can be
counted by the following generalization of (7),

z = z d exp(iz t

(24)
the path integral (7) depends only on the t-independent average h0(x). in
particular, in the ghost action (13) the hamiltonian h(x, t) can be converted
into h0(x) by a sp(2n ) gauge transformation which leaves the -invariant
of the hessian intact. as a consequence we conclude that the path integral
(24) should not change if we replace h(x, t)  h0(x) in it.

the atiyah-patodi-singer index theorem [9] relates the -invariant of
a (0+1) dimensional dirac operator to the index of a (1+1) dimensional

dirac operator. accordingly we extend our hessian (5) to the following
two-dimensional dirac operator on a cylinder s1  r
/q =  
q 0 ! (25)
here ds with s  r is a one-parameter family of symmetric hessians on the
cylinder. we dene them by promoting our t -periodic solution x(t) into
a one-parameter family of t -periodic trajectories u(s, t), an instanton that
adiabatically interpolates between x(t) at s  + and another t -periodic
y(t) at s  ,

s

u(s, t) = x(t)

u(s, t) = y(t)

(26)

the operators ds have an s-dependent eigenvalue problem

dsfn(t, s) = n(s)fn(t, s) ,

fn(0, s) = fn(t, s)

(27)

and in the absence of jacobi elds at s   all n() 6= 0. but
as a function of the adiabatic parameter s, the operators ds in general
exhibit a non-trivial spectral ow with some of the eigenvalues n(s) crossing
zero when the parameter s evolves. this spectral ow can be computed by
applying the atiyah-patodi-singer index theorem to the dirac operator /q.
it relates the index of /q on the cylinder to the -invariants of the operator
ds at the s   ends of the cylinder,

ind /q = dim kerq  dim kerq

tr f

(28)

here f = s(0a) is a sp(2n )-valued eld strength: we have a two dimen-
sional sp(2n ) gauge eld a with components at = 0a and as = 0. in
general the contribution from f cancels the continuous part in the dierence
of the -invariants in (28). but since we have veried that in the darboux
variables (11) the sp(2n ) valued gauge eld 0a is explicitly traceless, the
relative -invariant in (28)

d = d[y(t)]  d[x(t)]

(29)

7

should be an integer, it coincides with the net spectral ow between the two
congurations x(t) and y(t),

d  spectral ow of /q

(30)

in particular (29) determines the relative sign between the determinants of
the hessians for the two trajectories y(t) and x(t). hence d coincides
with the relative morse index between the two trajectories, which is also the
dierence between their maslov indices [3].

instead of (24) we proceed with the more general

dt (cid:16)k xk + k   kx k

h  kkx l

h

d# .

l(cid:17) +

z = z d exp"iz t

(31)
with d the relative -invariant w.r.t. a xed t -periodic reference trajec-
tory y(t). it is integer valued, and twice the index of /q in the background of
the pertinent instanton u(s, t). since (24) remains intact when we replace
h(x, t) by its average h0(x), we can expect that (31) also remains intact
when we set h(x, t)  h0(x).

since the relative -invariant in (31) coincides with the integer valued in-
dex of the dirac operator /q, it should not change under a continuous change
of variables. this suggests that we can evaluate the integral (31) by local-
ization. accordingly we decompose the variables  in their t-independent
and t-dependent components,   0 + t, and set x(t)  x0 + xt,
(t)  0 + t, and (t)  0 +  t with  a parameter. the corre-
sponding super-jacobian in (31) is trivial, and we localize by setting   0.
in this limit the path integral (7) is known to localize to the poincare-hopf
representation of the euler characteristic of the phase space  [10],

z = xxh0 =0

sign det(xh0) =

2n

2n

(1)kmk =

xk=0

(1)kbk = () (32)

xk=0

where mk denotes the number of critical points with morse index k. in a
similar manner we expect the path integral (31) to localize into

z = xxh0 =0

sign det(xh0) exp(cid:18)+

i
2

d(cid:19)

(33)

8

where d is now the relative -invariant for the critical points of h0(x)
w.r.t. the xed periodic reference trajectory y(t). we select this reference
trajectory so that it coincides with a critical point of h0(x) with morse index
0. according to the standard nite dimensional morse inequality mp  bp
and b0  1 which ensures that such a critical point always exists. with
this, the pertinent dirac index (28) simplies into

ind /q = dim ker q  dim kerq = dim ker q

(34)

this follows directly from the zero mode equation in the adiabatic limit,
where we can use the ansatz

with

gn(s, t) = n(s)n(t)

dsn(t) = n(s)n(t)

this reduces the zero mode equations for q and q to

with solutions

(s  n(s))n(s) = 0

n(s) = exp(cid:20)z s

0

dsn(s)(cid:21) n(0)

respectively. hence q = s + ds does not have a normalizable zero mode
and (34) follows. in particular, the spectral ow is only from positive eigen-
values of the hessian to its negative eigenvalues, which implies that the con-
tribution from the relative -invariant d in (33) coincides with the morse
index mh0(x) = k of the critical point. since sign det(xh0) = (1)k and
morse inequalities yield mk  bk, we then conclude that modulo an overall,
irrelevant sign the path integral (31) localizes into

z = xxh0 =0

sign det(xh0) exp(ik) = xxh0 =0

as a consequence we have a lower bound estimate for the number of periodic
classical trajectories which is consistent with the arnold conjecture.

in conclusion, we have studied relations between a path integral and
the arnold conjecture. we have related the path integral to the properties
of a two dimensional dirac operator and applied the atiyah-patodi-singer
index theorem to evaluate it using localization methods.
in this manner
we have found a lower bound estimate for the number of periodic classical
trajectories which is consistent with the arnold conjecture. our approach
is based on intuitive path integral arguments, and we hope that a rigorous
derivation of the conjecture could be developed along these lines.

we thank topi karki for discussions. our research has been partially

laboration that was largely completed by march 2nd 1999, when mauri
miettinen unexpectedly passed away just one month before his scheduled
