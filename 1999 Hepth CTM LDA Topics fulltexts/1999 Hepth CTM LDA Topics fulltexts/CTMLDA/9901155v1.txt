abstract

the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop functional in pure yang-mills
theory on an arbitrary two-dimensional orientable manifold is studied. we consider
the calculation of this quantity for the abelian theory in the continuum case and
for the arbitrary gauge group and arbitrary lattice action in the lattice case. a
classication of topological sectors of the theory and the related classication of
the principal bre bundles over two-dimensional surfaces are given in terms of a
cohomology group. the contribution of su (2)-invariant connections to the vacuum
expectation value of the wilson loop variable is also analyzed and is shown to be
similar to the contribution of monopoles.

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

1

1 introduction

yang-mills theory in two dimensions has been object of intensive studies during almost
two decades.
it is known that the classical theory is trivial and the quantum theory
has no propagating degrees of freedom. however, this theory possesses many interesting
properties when formulated on topologically nontrivial spaces [1], [2] and also in the
large n limit (n is related to the rank of the gauge group g = su(n)) [3]. a two-
dimensional yang-mills theory is almost topological in the sense that, for example, for
compact spacetime manifolds of surface area (two-dimensional volume) v its partition
function depends only on e2v , where e is the gauge coupling constant. also, as we will
see, the vacuum expectation value of a wilson loop depends only on the area of the region
surrounded by the loop and is independent of the points where the loop is located. this is
a manifestation of the invariance under the area preserving dieomorphisms. it is believed
that two-dimensional yang-mills theories share some of the important qualitative features
of four-dimensional ones, in particular the area law behaviour. it was shown recently that
in the strong coupling limit they can be related to lower-dimensional strings [4] and that
they play special role in m-theory [5]. all these have led to the revival of interest in
studying two-dimensional yang-mills theories. rich mathematical structures, appearing
in such theories, were studied in a number of papers [1], [2], [6] (see lecture [7] for a review
and references). the partition function and the vacuum expectation values of wilson loop
functionals were calculated by many authors with various techniques [8] - [10]. physical
aspects of these theories, in particular the analysis of polyakov loops and the -vacua,
were discussed in refs. [11].

in the present article we focus on the study of the vacuum expectation values < t > of
the wilson loop functionals t in the pure yang-mills theories with arbitrary gauge group
g on two-dimensional orientable compact manifolds m. such theories are non-trivial due
to non-trivial topology of m. in the classical theory the wilson loop functionals [12] form
a natural (over)complete set of gauge invariant variables. it is believed that their vacuum
expectation values play similar role in the quantum theory. the area law behaviour of this
quantity is considered as an indication of the regime of connement in the corresponding
gauge theory with quarks. there are various techniques for the calculation of < t > in
two-dimensional pure gauge theories [8] - [10]. here we carry out such calculation by using
dierent techniques and paying attention to some important details. in the abelian case
g = u(1) we calculate the vacuum expectation value of the wilson variable by expanding
the functional integral over the topological sectors of the theory and integrating over
uctuations around the monopole solution in each sector. the motivation is based on an
analogy with quantum mechanics which we will also discuss. it will be shown that the
functional integral for < t > is indeed saturated by the sum of the contributions of the
topological sectors. for this expansion one needs a classication of the topological sectors
of the theory or, equivalently, the classication of the principal bre bundles over two-
dimensional surfaces, and we will give a solution of this problem in terms of cohomology
groups. next, we perform the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the wilson
variable for an arbitrary gauge group using a lattice technique. the novelty here is in

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

2

carrying out the integration on the lattice in terms of loop variables associated to the
plaquettes and homotopically non-trivial loops and imposing the relation between the
loops on the lattice by inserting a certain -function. an alternative technique of the
calculation in terms of dierential forms on the lattice, that works for the abelian case is
also discussed.

besides discussing the methods of calculation of the vacuum expectation value < t >
of the wilson variable we also focus on the analysis of the contributions of monopole solu-
tions and invariant gauge connections [13], [14] to this quantity. our aim is to understand
the role of such congurations in the formation of the area law dependence of < t >. the
class of invariant connections plays important role in certain problems of eld theory, like,
for example, in the coset space dimensional reduction in multidimensional gauge theories
[15], [16]. besides many known monopole and instanton solutions, it also includes families
of connections parametrized by a nite number of parameters. the expectation is that
though this class of connections is rather restricted, it may nevertheless capture some im-
portant properties of the complete theory. as concrete examples we analyze the invariant
connections in the yang-mills theory with certain gauge groups on the two-dimensional
sphere s2 and calculate the contribution of the family of invariant connections in the case
of g = su(2). our observation is that the quadratic area dependence of the contribution
of the monopoles and of the invariant connections to ln < t > is crucial for the area law
dependence of the complete function in a wide range of the area variable.

the plan of the article is as follows. in sect. 2 we will give basic denitions and discuss
the functional integral in gauge theory in the case when the space of connections consists
of many components (sectors). the result on the classication of principle bre bundles
is also presented. in sect. 3 we will calculate the vacuum expectation value < t > of
the wilson loop variable in the abelian case for arbitrary m. in sect. 4 < t > will be
calculated on the lattice for an arbitrary gauge group and arbitrary lattice action. in sect.
5 we will study the invariant connections and their contribution to < t > in the case
m = s2 and g = su(2). in sect. 6 a discussion of the role of monopoles and invariant
connections for the area law behaviour of < t > will be presented.

2 wilson loop variables and integration over connec-

tions

let us rst set some basic notations and denitions. in the present article we consider
pure gauge theories on a two-dimensional orientable riemannian manifold m with a
gauge group g. m plays the role of the euclidean space-time, and we will mainly be
considering the case when it is compact. by g we will denote the lie algebra of g. we
use the formalism of principal bre bundles and connections in them (see, for example,
[13]) to describe the gauge theory [17], [18]. let p (m, g) be a principal bre bundle
over the manifold m with the structure group g. a potential a of the gauge theory is
characterized by a connection in p (m, g) via a local section in a standard way. namely,

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

let s be a local section over a neighbourhood u of m. then a = (ie)1sw, where e
is the gauge coupling constant and sw is the pull-back of the connection form w with
respect to this section (we use for a the normalization adopted in eld theory). the
g-valued 1-form a determines the components of the local gauge potential a on m in
the gauge corresponding to the section s through the relation a = adx. if ui and uj
are two overlapping neighbourhoods, then at x  uij = uit uj the gauge potential forms
a(i) and a(j), dened for ui and uj respectively, satisfy certain consistency conditions.
these conditions basically mean that a(i) and a(i) are gauge equivalent. vice versa, a
set of forms a(i), dened on neighbourhoods ui of an atlas {ui, i} of the manifold m
and satisfying the consistency conditions, dene a unique connection form w on p (m, g)
(see, for example, [17]). we denote by a the space of connections in p (m, g).
continuous mappings of the unit interval i = [0, 1] into m:
s  i  (s)  m

let us x a point x0 in m and consider based loops dened in a standard way as

 : i  m,

with (0) = (1) = x0. the space of loops on m based at x0 will be denoted as (m, x0).
let us consider a loop  which, for the sake of simplicity, is situated inside one neigh-

bourhood and associate with it the element of g called holonomy:

h(a) = p exp(cid:18)iei

a(cid:19) ,

(1)

where e is the gauge coupling constant, p means path ordering and a is the gauge 1-form,
dening the potential. we will be interested in traced holonomies

t(a) =

1
dr

t r r(h(a)) =

1
dr

r(h(a))

(2)

called also wilson loop variables [12]. here r is an irreducible representation of g, dr
is its dimension and r is its character. let us denote by t the group of local gauge
transformations, i.e. the group of smooth vertical automorphisms of p . it is known that
a set of elements t, associated to loops   (m, x0) and satisfying certain relations,
called mandelstam conditions, suces to separate points in a/t , representing classes
of gauge equivalent congurations, and therefore enable to reconstruct all smooth gauge
connections up to gauge equivalence [19]. due to this property the wilson loop functionals
(2) form a natural set of gauge invariant functions of connections in the classical theory.
we will study the vacuum expectation value < t > of the wilson loop functional

dened as

< t > =

the expression (4) and the measure da are understood in the heuristic sense adopted
in quantum eld theory.
it is known that in two-dimensional yang-mills theories the
measure can be dened in a rigorous way [20] (see also [10]), we will return to this issue
in sect. 4. the integral in (4) is taken over the space of connections a (we will not make
distinction between connection forms in p (m, g) and gauge forms a on m). in general
a may consist of a number of components (or sectors) a, labelled by elements  of an
index set b,   b. the functional integral is represented as a sum over the elements of
b, each term of the sum being the functional integral over the connections in a. this
feature has an analog in quantum mechanics which we are going to discuss rst.
consider the functional integral describing propagation of a particle on a manifold m

from a point x0 to x1 during the time t :

k(t ; x0, x1) =< x1|et h|x0 >=

1

z z x(t )=x1
x(0)=x0 yt

dx(t) exp(z t

0

l(x, x)dt) .

here we integrate over all trajectories x(t) (in general, not only over smooth ones) going
from x0 to x1. let us focus on the case when the initial point and the nal point coincide:

k(t ; x0, x0) =

1

z z x(t )=x0

x(0)=x0 dx(t) exp(z t

0

l(x, x)dt) ,

(6)

so that the integral goes over closed paths in m, i.e. over elements of (m, x0). if m
the rst homotopy group 1(m, x0) 6= 0, then (m, x0)
is not simply connected, i.e.
consists of more than one connected components. the set of path connected components
of (m, x0) is in one-to-one correspondence with elements of 1(m, x0) [21]. so, the
functional integral (6) becomes

k(t ; x0, x0) = x1(m,x0)
= x1(m,x0)

k ()(t ; x0, x0)

(7)

1

z z x()(t )=x0

x()(0)=x0 dx()(t) exp(z t

0

l(x(), x())dt) ,

and each integral in this sum is taken over paths x() belonging to a class corresponding
to   1(m, x0).
as an example let us consider the case m = s1 and let  be the angle parameter of
the circle, 0   < 2. the fundamental group 1(s1) is isomorphic to the abelian group
of integer numbers, 1(s1) = z, therefore the path-connected components of (s1, 0) are
labelled by integers n called winding number. the component with a winding number n
consists of loops which go n times around the circle s1 (counterclockwise for n > 0 and
clockwise for n < 0). thus, in this case

k(t ; 0, 0) =



xn=

1

z z (n)(t )=0

(n)(0)=0 d(n)(t) exp(z t

0

l((n), (n))dt)

(see, for example, ref. [22] for a study of the quantum rotor withing such approach).

an alternative but equivalent way of treating the integral (6) is to consider it not over
the paths on the manifold m but on the universal covering space m of m [23]. such
space is simply connected and exists for every connected manifold m. in this case we
integrate over paths in m . we x an initial point x(0)
0 which projects to the point x0  m,
p(x(0)
0 ) = x0, where p is the covering space map. then we sum contributions over all paths
which end at points x()
of the set p1(x0), since they all project to x0. it is known that
elements of p1(x0) are in 1-1 correspondence with elements   1(m, x0), therefore

k(t ; x0, x0) = x1(m,x0)

in principle, to each partial amplitude some weights can be assigned:

k(t ; x0, x0) = x1(m,x0)

()k ()(t ; x0, x0)

(cf. (7)). in ref. [24] an analysis of these weights was carried out and it was shown that
this arbitrariness leads only to an irrelevant overall phase factor for the total amplitude.
let us return to the gauge theory. in this case the set of connected components of a
is in 1-1 correspondence with the set of non-equivalent (i.e. which cannot be mapped one
into another by a bundle isomorphism) principal g-bundles p (m, g) over manifold m.

let us denote this set as bg(m), i.e. b = bg(m). the problem of characterization of this

set and classication of such bundles is considered in a number of books and articles. a
method, which in many cases gives a solution to this problem and which we closely follow
here, is discussed in lectures [25]. relevant results from algebraic topology can be found
in [26]-[28]. here we only outline the construction. we would like to note that in fact the
considerations and the results in the rest of this section are valid for a more general case,
namely when m is a cw-complex and not just a smooth manifold.

it is known that for each structure group there exists a universal principal g-bundle
eg = p (bg, g) with the base bg. the total space eg of the universal bundle is -
universal, i.e. q(eg) = 0 for all q  1. the important property is that every principal
g-bundle over m can be obtained (up to equivalence) from eg as the induced bundle,
i.e. p = f (eg) for some mapping f : m  bg [27]. one can prove that bg(m) is
isomorphic to the space of all homotopy equivalent classes of mappings f : m  bg,

bg(m) = [m ; bg].

by examing a certain exact homotopy sequence it can be shown that the base bg of the
universal bundle satises the property [25], [27]

q(bg) = q1(g),

q  1.

(8)

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

the question is how one can construct such universal bundles and characterize [m; bg]
in terms of objects which can be calculated in a relatively easy way. it turns out that the
eilenberg - maclane spaces play important role for this problem because of their special
homotopic properties. such spaces are often denoted as k(, n), where  is a group and
n is a positive integer, and are dened as follows:

i)

ii)

k(, n)

is path connected;

q (k(, n)) = ( ,

0,

if q = n,
if q 6= n.

if n  1 and  is abelian, the space k(, n) exists as a cw-complex and can be con-
structed uniquely up to a homotopy equivalence [26]. the property, which is crucially
important for us, is the following:

[m; k(, n)] = h n(m, ),

where h n(m, ) is the nth singular cohomology group [26], [27], [29]. a simple example
is k(z, 1) = s1.

often the eilenberg-maclane spaces are innite dimensional. the example important
for us is the space cp which is a cw-complex. it is understood as the union (direct
limit) of the complex projective spaces cpn of the sequence cp1  cp2  . . . [26]. then
q(cp) = limj q(cpj) and

2(cp) = z, q(cp) = 0 for q 6= 2.

thus, cp = k(z, 2).

this space serves for the classication of principal ber bundles with g = u(1). in-
deed, one can construct the sequence of hopf brations s2n+1  cpn with the bre u(1).
it can be shown that the space s is -universal and the bundle s = p (cp, u(1))
is the universal bundle. therefore, eu(1) = s, bu(1) = cp and
bu (1)(m) = [m; bu(1)] = [m; k(z, 2)] = h 2(m; z),

(9)

ref. [25]. this relation gives the classication of principal u(1)-bundles p (m, u(1)) over
m. note that the result (9) is valid for m of any dimension. for the case when m is a
smooth manifold it was discussed in [30].

now let us consider the generalization of this construction for the case of other gauge
groups. the idea is that for classication of bundles with the base m with dim m  n
only homotopy groups of low dimensions are important. then instead of bg one can use
some other space bgn which is related to it and which may be easier to construct and
to study. to dene bgn let us introduce the notion of p-equivalence. consider two path
connected spaces x and y and a continuous map f : x  y such that for all x  x
the induced map f : q(x, x)  q(y, f (x)) is an isomorphism for 0 < q < p and an
epimorphism for q = p. such map f is called p-equivalence. then, if there exists some
space bgn and a map f : bg  bgn which is (n + 1)-equivalence, it can be proved that

[m; bg] = [m; bgn]

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

7

for any cw-complex m with dim m  n [27], [28].
due to eq. (8) 1(bg) = 0. then we take bg2 = k(1(g), 2). we have

let us suppose that the structure group (gauge group) is connected, so that 0(g) = 0.

1(bg2) = 1 (k(1(g), 2)) = 0 = 1(bg),
2(bg2) = 2 (k(1(g), 2)) = 1(g) = 2(bg),
q(bg2) = q (k(1(g), 2)) = 0 for q > 2.

moreover,

[bg; bg2] = [bg; k(1(g), 2)] = h 2(bg, 1(g))

and this assures the existence of a mapping f : bg  k(1(g), 2) which is 3-equivalence
[26]. thus, if dim m = 2

bg(m) = [m; bg] = [m; bg2] = [m; k(1(g), 2)] = h 2(m, 1(g)).

(10)

this gives us the classication of principal bre bundles p (m, g) over two-dimensional
manifolds cw-complexes with the structure group g.

an equivalent classication of principal bre bundles over a two-dimensional surface
in terms of elements of the group , specifying the global structure of g through the
relation g = g/, where g is the universal covering group of g, was given in ref. [2].

for completeness, we present here a list of the rst homotopy groups 1(g) for some

lie groups which are of interest in gauge theories:

1. simply connected, g = su(n), sp(n): 1(g) = 0.

2. g = so(n), n = 3 and n  5: 1(g) = z2.
3. g = u(n): 1(g) = z.

for g = u(n) and n = 1 the gauge group is abelian and result (10) becomes the relation
(9) discussed above.

3 calculation of the wilson loop for g = u (1), con-

tinuous case

in this section we calculate the vacuum expectation value (3) of the wilson loop variable
in the abelian case. since the surface m has non-trivial topology the result is non trivial.
the functional integral will be evaluated by summing over the monopoles and integrating
over the uctuations around each monopole. the result will be shown to be exact by
comparing with the result of the calculation of < t > on the lattice in sect. 4. this
means that the functional integral (4) is saturated by quasiclassical contributions.

as it was shown in the previous section, u(1)-bundles are classied by elements of
the second cohomology group h 2(m, z). the class c1(p )  h 2(m, z), corresponding to

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

8

the bundle p , is known as the rst (integer) chern class [13], [26], [28]. for a closed
orientable 2-dimensional manifold m h 2(m, z) = z. for the bundle pn, characterized
by the label n  b = z, the integer cohomology class can be represented by ef (n)/(2)
with f (n) being the curvature 2-form dened locally through f (n) = da(n), where a(n) is
the gauge 1-form given by a connection in pn. the integral

e

f (n) = n,

(11)

does not depend on the choice of the connection and gives the rst chern number which
is also called topological charge.

let us turn to the calculation of the functional integral (4). we will consider the case
of one simple loop  which is the boundary of a region , i.e.  = . so, we consider
the case of homologically trivial loop. generalization to the case of multiple loops is
straightforward though rather cumbersome, see ref. [10]. let us assume that the wilson
loop variable (2) is dened for the irreducible respresentation of u(1) labelled by   z,
i.e.
(12)

t(a) = exp(cid:26)iei

a(cid:27) .

using the quantum mechanics analogy, discussed in the previous section, and the fact
that h 2(m; z) = z we write

z() =



xn=z da(n)es(a(n))t(a(n)) =



xn=

z (n)(),

(13)

where in each term z (n) the integration goes over gauge potentials with the chern number
equal to n, i.e. over potentials given by connections in the bre bundle pn. we represent
a(n) = a(n) + a, where a(n) is a potential with

f (n) =

2n

e

,

zm

f (n) = d a(n) and a is a 1-form with the zero chern number. thus the 2-form f (n) is
equal to f (n) = f (n) + f , where f = da globally, and satises eq. (11). as a(n) we take
instanton congurations, i.e. solutions of the equation of motion. in the literature they
are often referred to as monopoles, and we will follow this terminology in the present
paper.

assume that the manifold m is endowed with a riemannian metric gij. let us denote

by (, ) the scalar product of forms dened in the standard way:

(, ) = zm

for two p-forms  and .

for the action (5) in the abelian case the equation of motion is f = 0, where  is
the adjoint of the exterior derivative dened by (, d) = (, ). since any 2-form on

the two-dimensional manifold m is proportional to the volume 2-form , which locally is
equal to

the 2-form f (n) can be written as

 := qdet gdx1  dx2,

f (n) = (n)(x).

the equation of motion requires that

 f (n) =   d  ((n)(x)dv) = d(n) = 0,

i.e. (n) is constant. then condition (11) gives

(n) =

where v is the volume (area) of m.
the term z (n) in eq. (13) equals

(15)

(16)

(17)

z (n)() = za(0) da es( a(n)+a) t( a(n) + a).

here the functional integration goes over connections with zero topological charge on the
trivial bundle p0. the abelian action can be written as

( f (n) + f, f (n) + f )

we see that zmon is a function of e2v and s/v . now it is clear that it is invariant under
the transformation s  (v  s).
as an illustration of this general calculation let us consider a concrete example of
m = s2 with a(n) being the dirac monopoles. consider a standard description of the

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

11

principal u(1)-bundles p (s2, u(1)) (see, for example, [18], [31]). we cover the sphere s2,
parametrized by angles  and  (0    , 0   < 2), with two charts, u1 and u2,
chosen as u1 = s2  {s} (the sphere without the southern pole) and u1 = s2 {n} (the
sphere without the northern pole):

u1 = {0   < , 0   < 2},
u2 = {0 <   , 0   < 2}.

(24)
(25)

the ber f = u(1) = s1 is parametrized by ei. thus

1(u1) = u1  u(1) = {, , +(, ) = ei1},
1(u2) = u2  u(1) = {, , (, ) = ei2},

where  is the canonical projection. the bundle is characterized by the transition function
12(, ) = 2(, )1
1 (, ) which is a mapping from u12 = u1  u2 to the gauge group
g = u(1). in our case it is enough to consider the transition function only on the equator,
i.e. the mapping 12 : s1  u(1) = s1. such mappings are labelled by integers n  z
and are of the form (n)
12 () = ein. this implies that the principal bundles p (s2, u(1))
are labelled by integers n (in accordance with the general result (9)), and 2 = 1 + n.

for further discussion we need to consider de rham currents [32] or weak forms, according
to the terminology of ref. [33]. let us denote by w p(m) the space of weak p-forms on m
and remind the denition. generalizing the notion of distribution a weak p-form k is a
linear functional on the space dp(m), i.e. k : dp(m)  r, where dp(m) is the space of
test p-forms with compact support. the space w p(m) includes functionals corresponding

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

12

to c  p-forms, and we will denote the space of such forms by p(m). if w  p(m),
then the corresponding functional is dened as

w[u] := (w, u)  zm

w  u,

u  dp(m). because of this often the notation (k, u) for k[u] is used, where k  w p(m).
some basic operations on forms are extended to weak forms in an obvious way [33]

dk[u] = k[u], k[u] = k[du], k[u] = k[u],

(28)

etc., where  = d + d is the laplacian.
consideration in this section, dp(m) = p(m).

if m is compact, which is the case under

for our calculation we introduce the weak 1-form j, characterizing the loop  in the

following way:

j[u] = i

u,

u  1(m). since h u = h udx, formally we can write

j[u] = zm

j  u = zm

u(x)j 

 (x) ,

where  is the volume 2-form (15) and the contravariant components j 

 are given by

j 

 (y) = i

dx

1

qdet g

(y  x).

(29)

we also introduce the weak 2-form j which characterizes the surface , the interior

of the closed path , as follows:

j[v] = z
v  2(m). since  = , for u  1(m) we have:
u = i

j[du] = z

du = i

v,

u = j[u].

from this relation and eqs. (28) we conclude that j[u] = j[du] = j[u], i.e.

it is easy to see that formally

j = j.

j = h(x),

where h(x) is the characteristic function of the region  given by

h(x) = ( 1,

0,

x  ,
x 6 .

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

13

note that in fact j belongs to the space h2(m) of quadratically integrable 2-forms, i.e.
2-forms for which the norm ||j||, dened by (14), is nite.

the contribution of uctuations can be written as

z0() = za(0) da exp(cid:20)

1
2

(a, da) + ie(j, a)(cid:21) .

(34)

the operator d is not invertible on the space of gauge 1-forms a. first of all there are
zero modes due to the gauge invariance of the theory, that is the symmetry under gauge
transformations a  a = a + d. one deals with this problem in the standard way by
inserting the faddeev-popov -function, which gives rise to the gauge-xing term, and
integrating over the gauge group [34]. here we consider the covariant gauges, so that the
additional factor equal to exp [(1/2)(a, a)], where  is the gauge xing parameter,
appears in eq. (34). with this addition the quadratic operator does not have gauge zero
modes anymore. we choose  = 1, the feynman gauge. as a result eq.(34) becomes

z0() = za(0) da exp(cid:20)

1
2

(a, a) + ie(j, a)(cid:21) ,

(35)

where  is the laplacian. let us remind that since we are considering the abelian case
the faddeev-popov determinant gives an irrelevant constant factor in (35).

the laplacian  may have further zero modes related to symmetries of the manifold
m. the zero modes 0 are harmonic 1-forms on m, i.e.
they satisfy 0 = 0. we
will denote the space of harmonic p-forms on m as harmp(m). for example, if m
is the two-dimensional torus t 2, parametrized by the angles (1, 2) (0  i < 2),
there are two independent zero modes 01 = d1/(2) and 02 = d2/(2). any 1-form
 = c101 + c202, where c1 and c2 are constants, is harmonic. it cannot be eliminated
by gauge transformation    + d because, as it is easy to see using, for example, the
fourier expansion, such function  cannot be dened on the torus.
the existence of such zero modes is related to the invariance of the action s(a) with
respect to the transformation a  a = uca := a+ci0i, where 0i are zero modes. we as-
sume that they are normalized by (0i, 0j) = ij. according to the hodge decomposition
theorem (see, for example, [35])

hp(m) = harmp(m)  (harmp),

where hp(m) denotes the space of quadratically integrable p-forms and (harmp) is the
orthogonal compliment of harmp(m) with respect to the scalar product (14). let us
insert the unit

1 = z yi

 ((0i, uca)) .

after standard and simple manipulations we arrive to the expression

z0() = z yi

(36)

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

14

here we used the property of orthogonality

(0i, j) = (0i, j) = (d0i, j) = 0,

following from (31), and the fact that harmonic forms are closed and co-closed.

on the space (harmp) the laplacian  is invertible. thus one can dene the green

operator 1 : p(m)  (harmp) as

1 = (cid:16)|(harmp)(cid:17)1

 p,

where p is the projector of hp(m) onto (harmp) [35]. in particular, 1 = 1pi 0i

where

0i,

(0i

0i) () = 0iz 0i  .

(37)

the green operator satises

 1 = 1 = 1  1 xi

0i.

using this operator one can perform formally the gaussian functional integration in (36)
and obtain the naive expression

2
z0() = n exp"
2
() = (j, 1j),

e2()# ,

(38)

where constant n accumulates all factors independent of , they are irrelevant for our
result. from (29) it may seem that the inner product of the forms in (38) is singular. we
will show that in fact a well dened value can be assigned to it. for this let us consider
the following regularized version of eq. (38):

() = lim
0

(j, 1j()),

(39)

where the closed path () is some small deformation of the closed path  which does not
have common points with  and (0) =  (we assume that the manifold m and the path
 are such that such deformation is possible). the product of two weak forms is not well
dened in general. however, we will see that in our case eq. (39) makes sense due to the
facts that j = j, eq. (31), and j  h2(m). we understand (39) as

() = lim
0

(j, d 1j()),

(40)

with () = ().

now let us study the operator d 1 and prove that it is equal to the projector
2  1  w0iw
0i is the functional
corresponding to w0i in the sense explained above (see eq. (37)). indeed, since the green
operator commutes with all linear operators which commute with the laplacian , in

0i on l2(m), where w0i are harmonic 2-forms and w

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

15

particular  1 = 1 and d 1 = 1d [35], the following chain of operator relations
holds on 2(m):

d 1 = d 1 = (  d) 1

= 2   1d = 2.

(41)

the last equality follows from the fact that the operator d acts trivially on 2(m) (recall
that dim m = 2). the property (41) shows that the operator d 1 is smooth enough
and its action can be extended to h2(m).

let us return to the calculation of () in eq. (40). using eq. (41) we obtain that

() = lim
0

(j, 2j()) = (j, (1  w0iw

0i)j)

= (j, j)  |(j, w0i)|2 .

(42)
the form w0 = /v , where  is the volume 2-form (15), is the only (properly
normalized) zero mode (harmonic) form in 2(m).
indeed, d w0 = 0 and using the
properties of the adjoint of the exterior derivative  and of the hodge  operation we
verify that

 w0 = d  w0 = d

1
v

= 0.

this is in accordance with the fact that the space of harmonic p-forms harmp(m) is
isomorphic to the cohomology group h p(m; r) [35].
in the case under consideration
p = 2, dim m = 2,

harm2(m; r) = h 2(m; r) = r,

dim harm2(m; r) = 1, and, thus, all harmonic 2-forms are proportional to w0.

using denition (30) we write

(j, w0) = z

w0 =

1

v z

 =

s

.

with the help of eqs. (32), (33) we calculate the rst term in (42):

(j, j) = zm

h(x)  h(x) = zm

h2

(x) = z

 = s.

(43)

(44)

combining formulas (38), (42) and results (43), (44) we obtain the nal expression for
the contribution of uctuations around the monopoles:

z0() = n e e2

2 2 s(v s)

v

.

(45)

note that this expression is invariant under the transformation s  (v  s), the same
as zmon(). using (23) and (45) we obtain the result

it can be shown that for homologically non-trivial loops < t >= 0 (see also [10]). some
discussion of the properties of the expression (46) will be given at the end of sect. 4 where
it appears as a particular case of the general formula for an arbitrary gauge group.

let us analyze the quantity e(e2v, s/v ) :=  ln < t > which in a theory with
fermions characterizes the potential of the interaction. e(e2v, s/v ) can be read o from
eq. (46) and is plotted in fig. 1 as a function of s/v for two values of e2v (for  = 1).
in the same plot we also show the contribution emon(e2v, s/v ) of the abelian mo-
nopoles calculated from eq.
(21). we see from fig. 1 (also from the exact formula
(23)) that the dependence of emon(e2v, s/v ) on s/v at small s/v is quadratic almost
till s/v = 0.5, where the curve reaches its maximum. this, being combined with the
contribution of the uctuations, gives the linear dependence (the area law) almost for all
s/v in the interval 0 < s/v < 0.5. the area law (linear dependence on s/v ) for the
wilson loop in the pure yang-mills theory is considered as an indication of the regime of
connement in the corresponding gauge theory with quarks. thus the quadratic behaviour
of the monopole contributions emon(e2v, s/v ) seems to be an important feature which
gives rise to the linear dependence of the complete function.

in sect. 5 we will study the analogous function for the contribution of invariant

connections.

4 lattice calculation of the wilson loop for arbitrary

gauge group

in this section we study a general pure gauge theory (5) on a two-dimensional orientable
compact manifold m. we will calculate the functional integral (4) again but now for the
case when the gauge group is an arbitrary compact lie group. as before we consider the
case of a single simple loop . we assume that  divides m into two regions 1, 2 of
genera r1, r2 and areas s1, s2 respectively. the genus of m is r = r1 + r2 and its area
v = s1 + s2 (see an example in fig. 2).

let us consider lattices on the manifold m [36]. a lattice can be viewed as a cw-
complex  = 0  1  2, where 0, 1 and 2 are nite sets whose elements are
0-cells s (sites), 1-cells l (links) and 2-cells p (plaquettes) respectively. for the purpose of
computation of the expectation value of t, we consider only lattices compatible with ,
i.e. lattices such that  is an 1-chain on them. the incidence functions i(s, l), i(l, p) for
pairs of cells of correlative dimension take values 0, 1 or 1 if the rst cell is not a face,
is a positive face or is a negative face of the second cell respectively. the topology of a

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

17

continuum surface, modelled by the lattice, is encoded in the discrete structure given by
 and i. the area of the plaquette p is denoted by |p|. the lattice spacing a is dened
as the minimum length such that every plaquette is conned in a circle of the radius a.
to calculate the functional integral (4) we will need a system of independent loops of
the lattice . for this we x a site s0 of 0, and for each plaquette p assign a connecting
path cp from s0 to p and dene the loop p = cppc1
p . in addition we choose a set of
homotopically non-trivial loops ai, bi i = 1, . . . , r which play the role of the generators of
the rst homotopy group of m [29], [31], [37]. the index i labels the handles of m (see
fig. 3 for an illustration).

at this point it is useful to think of m as being represented by a polygon with certain
identications of its sides. the system of loops {p, ai, bi} is not independent. more
precisely, it can be shown that there exists an appropriate choice of paths cp and an
ordering of the plaquettes so that the following relation is true:

yp

p = yi

aibia1

i b1

i

.

(47)

the idea of the construction is rather simple and is illustrated in fig. 4. the choice of
the connecting paths cp is essentially determined by the ordering of the plaquettes and is
not unique. it can be shown that nal results do not depend on this ambiguity.

using the results of [20] (see also [10]) one can give a well-dened meaning to the
heuristic measure da in eq. (4). it can be understood as the measure d0 constructed
out of copies of the haar measure on the group g. this is possible if the action can be
written as a cylindrical function on the space a/t . the standard yang-mills action s(a)
is not well dened on the lattice. hence one has to use some regularized action s(a)
on the lattice , calculate z(), which is a lattice analog of (4), and then take the limit
z() = lima0 z(), where a is the lattice spacing of .

in this article we consider a class of lattice actions with the property

es(a) = yp

esp(hp (a)),

(48)

where the product is taken over all plaquettes of .

the function sp is a real function over g which satises the following three conditions:
1) sp(g) = sp(g1) for g  g;
2) it reaches the absolute minimum on the identity element;
3) lima0 sp(hp(a))|p|1 = 1
two main examples, which we have in mind, are:
a) the wilson action [12]:

2 t r(f(x))2.

sp(g) = 1 

1
df

ref (g),

where f denotes the fundamental representation of g;

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

b) the heat-kernel action [38]:

sp(g) =  lnxr

drr(g)e e2

2 c2(r)|p|,

18

(49)

where c2(r) is the value of the casimir operator for the representation r. when g = u(1)
the heat-kernel action is also called villain action. with actions of this type the integrand
in (4) is a cylindrical function.

the standard way to proceed would be the following. taking into account relation
(47) we can construct a system of independent loops j, j = 1, . . . , n, where n =(number
of plaquettes)+2r  1. let us introduce the notation gj  hj (a), where the holonomy
is dened by eq. (1). the measure d0 is given by d0 = qn
j=1 dgj , where dgj is the
haar measure on g. further, one expresses each loop p or ai, or bi in terms of j, like
p = qj j, so that hp(a) = qj gj , and considers functions
p(g1, . . . , gn ) = exphsp(cid:16)hp(a)(cid:17)i

on gn (direct product of n copies of g). since the lattice is compatible with  we can

also decompose  over the independent loops j:  = qj j.

in this way one obtains that

z() = lim
a0

z(),

d0es(a)t([a])

(50)

here, as in eq. (2), we assume that the wilson loop variable is in the irreducible repre-
sentation r of g. actually the integration in (50) goes over a certain closure a/t , see
details in ref. [10], [20].
in this article we will use another approach to the calculation of integral (50). we
begin the calculation by changing it to another form. the variables {gq}  {gp, gai, gbi}
will be treated as independent ones and relation (47) will be imposed by inserting the
-function

[{gq}] = g(yp

gp,yi

where g(g, h) is the dirac distribution on the group g with the main property

then

dgg(g, h)f (g) = f (h).

now we use the fact that the action, given by eq. (48), can be expressed in terms of
generalized fourier coecients. we can write

esp(g) = xrp

drprp(g)brp(p),

(52)

where the coecients brp(p) are equal to

brp(p) = z dgesp(g)

rp(g),

here we interchanged the product over plaquettes and the summation over representa-
tions, so that the last expression is a sum over colorations of the surface, i.e. congu-
rations or sets {rp} of irreducible representations of the gauge group such that to each
plaquette q there is an rq  {rp} associated to it. the integrals over gp are non-zero
only for certain congurations, this depends on the topology of the surface.
the decomposition of  is given in terms of loops located in one of the regions whose

border is , say 1. then,

where the superscript (1) means the restriction to 1 (see fig. 3).

to perform the gp-integration we use a procedure of lattice reduction. if plaquettes
p1 and p2 share a link which does not belong to  (in this case they are in the same i
component), then we shift the group variable gp1  gp1g1
p2 and use the invariance of the

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

20

measure. in this way gp2 disappears from the arguments of the -function  and of r,
and we can integrate it out obtaining

z dgp2drp1

(gp1g1

(gp2) = drp1

.

(54)

the eect is that both plaquettes are forced to carry the same representation in which
case the common link is erased and the two plaquettes merge into one plaquette while
the structure of the integrand in (53) remains the same. we continue integrating over the
plaquette variables in this way until we arrive to a lattice consisting only of two plaquettes
p1 and p2 in representations r1 and r2 correspondingly. these two plaquettes can be
envisioned by cutting the surface m through the lines  and ai, bi.

thus we obtain that

to obtain the continuum limit one should, in general, compute the coecients br(p)
and take their innitesimal area limit. this is the case if we work, for example, with the
wilson action. if we use instead the heat-kernel action (49) we have

br(p) = e e2

where br = exp(e2c2(r)/2), is independent of the lattice spacing, so that it gives
already the continuum limit. of course, as one can check, in the limit a  0 the results
of the calculations with any action of the type (48) coincide (see [10] for examples).

let us now consider the above result in the abelian case. for abelian groups dr = 1
and the topology of the surface is irrelevant. for g = u(1) the irreducible representations
are labelled by integers n  z. if the region 1 carries r1 = n, then from the denition
of {r1, r, r2} in eq. (56) r2 = n + , where  labells the irreducible representation for
which the wilson loop variable is calculated (see (12)). since bn = exp (e2n2/2), we

which coincides with the result (46) in sect. 3

another derivation of the formula for < t > which uses the dierential calculus of

the lattice is given in the appendix.

a few comments are relevant here:

 eq. (58) is obviously invariant under the transformation s  v  s.
 although we have considered compact surfaces only, the same technique applies to
the non-compact case. the main dierence is that in the non-compact case one of
the regions, say, 1 is innite and the irreducible representation corresponding to
it has to be trivial. this case can also be obtained as the limit v   of the
compact one. performing the limit in eq. (58) we see that the expectation value of
the wilson loop functional for the euclidean plane r2 or any non-compact surface
has the typical area law behaviour,

< t >= e e2

2 2s,

(59)

where s denotes the area of the region surrounded by the loop .

 for nite v the same behaviour is obtained in the strong coupling limit e2v  1.

that is, in this limit the region with the smaller area dominates.

which follows from eq. (58) after applying the poisson summation formula (22).
this coincides with the contribution (45) of the trivial sector with zero topological
charge, as it can be expected, since in the weak coupling limit the contributions of
the monopoles are exponentially supressed, see eq. (21).

for non-abelian groups properties of the representations of the particular group play
an explicit role in (57). as an example let us consider the case g = su(2) with  in the

5 wilson loop variables for invariant connections.

in sect. 3, while calculating the vacuum expectation average of the wilson loop functional
in the abelian case, we studied the contribution of instantons.
in the present section
we will calculate wilson loop variables for a special class of connections called invariant
connections. the result of the calculation will be compared with the exact formula derived
above, and this will allow us to understand how much of the information is captured by
the invariant connections. our interest in this class of connections is motivated by the fact
that the analogous calculation can be carried out in yang-mills theory in any dimension
provided, of course, that non-trivial invariant connections exist.

first we discuss the denition of invariant connections and their construction.
invariant connections in a principal bre bundle are connections which are invariant
under the action of a group of transformations on the bundle.
in eld theory models
this situation occurs when some group k acts on the space-time manifold (the base of
the bre bundle) and its action can be lifted to the action of a subgroup of the group
of automorphisms. then k is called symmetry group. let p (m, g) be a principal bre
bundle with the structure group g over the base m and lk, k  k be an action of the
symmetry group in p . since k acts as a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of p ,
the following relation holds:

(lkp)g = lk(pg)

for all k  k, g  g p  p,

where multiplication by an element of g from the right denotes the canonical action of
the structure group on the principal bre bundle. let us denote by ok the corresponding
action of the symmetry group on the base manifold. it is dened in a natural way by

ok ((p)) =  (lkp) , k  k, p  p,

(60)

where  is the canonical projection in p . for our purposes it is enough to consider the
case when the action of k on m is transitive. more general situation, when m consists of
orbits of the action of k occurs, for example, in the problem of the coset space dimensional
reduction [15] (see ref. [16] for a review).

now we are ready to give the denition. a connection in p is said to be invariant

with respect to transformations of the group k if its connection form w satises

l

kw = w

(61)

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

24

for all k  k. in case of gauge theory the relevant question is what is the property of
the gauge potential given by an invariant form. such potentials were introduced in refs.
[14] and were called symmetric potentials. initially they were used for the construction of
ansatze for solutions of equations of motion. it can be shown that condition (61) implies
that for any k  k there exists a gauge tranformation gk(x)  g such that the gauge
potential a, corresponding to the invariant connection form w, satises

(oka) = gk(x)1a(x)gk(x) +

1
ie

gk(x)1gk(x)

(62)

for all k  k, where the l.h.s.
is the eld obtained by the space-time transformation.
this formula means that the symmetric potential is invariant under transformations from
k up to a gauge transformation.

invariant connections were rst studied by wang [39] who proved a theorem which
gives a complete characterization of such connections (see [13]). we will follow ref. [16]
in the description of this construction.

the fact that the symmetry group acts transitively on the base means that m is a
coset space k/h, where h is a subgroup of k called the isotropy group. k acts on
k/h in the canonical way: ok[k1] = [kk1], where points x  m are understood as classes
x = [k]  kh of k/h. then the origin o of m = k/h, that is the class containing the
unit of k, o = [e] = h, is stable under the action of the elements from h. it follows
(60) that transformations lh with h  h act vertically on p .
immediately from eq.
thus, for each p  p there exists a mapping p : h  g dened by lhp = p p(h) for any
h  h. it can be shown that this mapping is in fact a group homomorphism. the existing
symmetry allows to carry out the reduction of the initial bre bundle to its subbundle over
the origin o such that the homomorphisms p are the same for points of this subbundle
(we will denote them by ). invariant connection forms w in p are characterized by their
values in this subbundle and are in a one-to-one correspondence with some mapping 
which we will describe right now. let g, k and h be the lie algebras of the groups g, k
and h respectively. if h is a closed compact subgroup of k, the case we have in mind,
then the homogeneous space k/h is reductive, i.e. exists the decomposition

k = h + m

(63)

with ad(h)m = m, where ad denotes the adjoint action of the group on its lie algebra.
the mapping  maps from m into g and is equivariant, i.e. satises the condition

 (ad(h)x) = ad((h))(x)

(64)

for all h  h and x  m. an explicit formula for an invariant form in terms of  and
 can be also given. for our purposes it is more convenient to write such formula for the
pull-back of w to the base m with respect to a (local) section s. let us denote such form
on m by a, a = sw. of course, if w is the invariant form, then a = adx, where
a is the corresponding symmetric potential satisfying (62). let  be the canonical left-
invariant 1-form on the lie group k with values in k, and  is its pull-back to k/h. if

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

25

k(x)  k is a representative of the class x  k/h, then  = k(x)1dk(x). we decompose
the 1-form  into the h- and m-components in accordance with (63):  = h + m. then
it can be shown that for a given homomorphism  all invariant connections are described
by

1

a =

ie (cid:16)(h) + (m)(cid:17) ,

(65)

where the mapping  satises the equivariant condition (64). here we denoted by the
same letter  the homomorphism from h to g induced by the group homomorphism. eq.
(65) is essentially the result of the wang theorem [13].
we see that the problem of construction of k-invariant connections on a homogeneous
space m = k/h is reduced to the construction of the mappings  : m  g. for this we
need to solve the constraints (64). for our purpose it is more convenient to consider the
same constraint in the innitesimal form

 (ad(y )x) = ad((y ))(x), y  h, x  m,

(66)

where ad denotes the adjoint action of the algebra. due to the algebraic structure
inherited by the vector subspace m  k ad(h) is given by the lie algebra bracket:
ad(y )x = [y, x]. similarly, if x1, x2  g, ad(x1)x2 = [x1, x2], where now the brack-
ets denote the multiplication in the lie algebra g. this case takes place in the r.h.s. of
eq. (66).
an eective technique for solving constraint (66) was developed in refs. [40] (see also
[16]). the main idea is to consider condition (66) as the intertwining condition and the
mapping  as the intertwining operator which intertwines representations of h in the
the vector spaces m and g. then the general structure of  is given by schurs lemma.
one has to decompose the vector spaces m and g into irreducible representations with
respect to the actions ad(h) and ad((h)) of the algebra h respectively and choose
pairs of equivalent representations. in practice it is easier to work not with the original
compact lie algebras and subspaces but with their complexied versions.
in this case
schurs lemma tells that the intertwining operator  is the identity between the subspaces
carrying equivalent irreducible representations of h and is zero between the subspaces
carrying non-equivalent ones.
as concrete examples we will consider the yang-mills theory on the two-dimensional
sphere s2 with the gauge groups g = u(1), su(2) and so(3). the sphere is realized
as a coset space s2 = su(2)/u(1). first let us construct the 1-forms h and m which
appear in eq. (65). as in sect. 3 we introduce the angles  and , parametrizing the
sphere, and the neighbourhoods u1 and u2 described by (24) and (25). as generators of
k = su(2) we take qj = j/2 (j = 1, 2, 3), where j are the pauli matrices. let the
subgroup h = u(1) be generated by q3. then the one-dimensional algebra h is spanned
by q3, and the vector space m in (63) is spanned by q1 and q2. consider now the
decomposition of the algebra k, which is the complexication of the lie algebra of the
group k = su(2). we denote by e and e the root vectors and by h the corresponding

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

26

cartan element of this algebra and take

with

e =  =

1
2

(1  i2), h = 3

ad (h) (e) = [h, e] = 2e.

then h = ch, m = ce + ce and the decomposition of the vector space m into
irreducible invariant subspaces of h is described by the following decomposition of the
representations:
(67)
where in the r.h.s. we indicated the eigenvalues of ad(h), and the space m of reducible
representation is indicated by its dimension in the l.h.s.
we choose the local representatives k(j) (j = 1, 2) of points of the neighbourhood uj

of the coset space s2 = su(2)/u(1) as follows

k(1)(, ) = ei 3

the functions k(i) : ui  su(2) can also be viewed as local sections of the principal bre
bundle k = p (k/h, h) over the base k/h = s2 with the structure group h = u(1).
by straightforward computation one obtains the forms h and m:

before using the general formula (65) for the invariant gauge connections one has to
specify the gauge group and the embedding (h)  g. we consider three examples.
example 1. g = u(1). let us realize elements of g by unimodular complex numbers
exp(it), where t is real. the group homomorphisms  : h  g are labelled by integers n
and given by

n(cid:16)ei 3

2 t(cid:17) = ei n

2 t.

the corresponding algebra homomorphisms are determined by n(h) = n. the one-
dimensional vector space g = lie(g) is the space of an irreducible representation of (h)
characterized by zero eigenvalue of ad((h)). taking decomposition (67) of m into
account it is easy to see that intertwining condition (66) fullls only for  = 0. thus, all

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

invariant connections are labelled by the integer n and the gauge potential is given by

a(i)

n =

i = 1, 2;

(1  cos )d,

where the lower indices of a(1)
n correspond to the labels of the homomorphism n.
these are the expressions for the dirac-wu-yang abelian monopole (26), and n charac-
terizes the monopole charge. monopoles with dierent n are described by connections in

n and a(2)

non-equivalent bre bundles. in accordance with our discussion in sect. 2 bu (1)(s2) = z,

i.e. such bundles are indeed classied by integers. we have shown that all of them appear
as particular invariant connections.
example 2. g = su(2). let e, e and h be the root vectors and the cartan ele-
ment of the algebra g = a1, which appears as complexication of the lie algebra of g.
we assume that they are given by the same combinations of the pauli matrices as the
corresponding elements of complexied lie algebra of k described above. the group
homomorphism  : h = u(1)  g = su(2) is given by the expression

(cid:16)ei 3

2 3(cid:17) = ei 3

2 3 = cos(

3
2

) + i3 sin(

),

(70)

and it is easy to check that this denition is consistent if  is integer. therefore the
homomorphism is again labelled by n  z. the induced algebra homomorphism is given
by
(71)
the three-dimensional space g of the adjoint representation of a1 decomposes into three
1-dimensional irreducuble invariant subspaces of n(h) and the decomposition is charac-
terized by the following decomposition of representations:

n(h) = nh.

3  (0) + (2n) + (2n)
(in brackets we indicate the eigenvalues of ad(n(h))).

(72)

let us now compare decompositions (67) and (72). for n 6= 1, 0 there are no equiv-
alent representations in the decomposition of m and g and the intertwining operator
 : m  g is zero. it also turns out to be zero for n = 0. in these cases according to
(65)

a(1)

n =

a(2)
n =

(73)

if n = 1 or n = 1 the results are more interesting. let us consider the case n = 1
rst. comparing (67) and (72) we see that there are pairs of representations with the same

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

28

eigenvalues and, therefore, the intertwining operator  is non-trivial. it is determined by
its action on the basis elements of m:

(e) = f1e, (e) = f2e,

(74)

where f1, f2 are complex numbers. the fact that the initial groups and algebras are
compact implies a reality condition [16] which tells that f1 = f 
2 . thus, the operator
 and the invariant connection are parametrized by one complex parameter f1 (we will
suppress its index from now on). using eqs. (68), (69), (71) and (74) we obtain from
(65) that

r2 (cid:16)|f|2  1(cid:17)2

,

(77)

(78)

where r is the radius of the sphere. due to the k-invariance any extrema of the action
found withing the subspace of invariant connections is also an extremum in the space of
all connections [16]. from eq. (78) we see that there are two types of extrema in the
theory: the maximum at f = 0 and the minima at f satisfying |f| = 1. only one of them,
the trivial extremum, was found in ref. [41] as a spontaneous compactication solution
in six-dimensional kaluza-klein theory.

similar situation takes place for  = 1. again there exists a 1-parameter family of
invariant connections parametrized by a complex parameter, say h, analogous to f . the
action possesses two extrema: at h = 0 and for |h| = 1.
it turns out that the potentials (73), (75) and (76) are related to known non-abelian
monopole solutions in this theory. namely, for n 6= 1 and for n = 1 with f = 0 these
expressions coincide with the monopole solutions with the monopole number  = n. in
fact the solution with  = n > 0 can be transformed to the solution with  = n by
the gauge transformation a  s1as with the constant matrix s = i1. eqs. (73)
and eqs. (75) and (76) with f = 0 describe all monopoles in the su(2) gauge theory
[42]. as it was shown in [43], [44] all of them, except the trivial conguration with n = 0,
are unstable. this is in accordance with the topological classication of monopoles [45]
(see also [44]) by elements of 1(g). this also agrees with the fact that there is only
one bundle (up to equivalence) with the base space s2 and the structure group su(2).

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

29

the latter statement follows from our discussion in sect. 2. indeed, in the case under

consideration bsu (2)(s2) = h 2(s2, 1(su(2))) = 0 since 1(su(2)) = 0.
thus, all the monopoles are described by connections in the trivial principal bre
bundle p (s2, su(2)) and can be represented by a unique form on the whole sphere [46].
this is indeed the case. namely there exist gauge transformations, dierent for u1 and
u2 patches, so that the tranformed potentials coincide. let us demonstrate this for the
case n = 1. in fact this property is true for the whole family of the invariant connections
(75), (76). the group elements of these gauge transformations of the potentials on u1
and u2 are

note that in general expressions (75), (76) and (79) the phase of the complex parameter
f can be rotated by residual gauge transformations which form the group u(1).

for f = 0 this formula gives the known expression for the  = 1 su(2)-monopole [46]:

(81)

of course, the forms (79) and (81) do not have singularities on the whole sphere. for
f = f  = 1 the forms (80) vanish. this shows that this conguration, which is also the
extremum of the action, describes the trivial case of the su(2)-monopole with  = 0.
note that in the original form the potentials (75) and (76) do not seem to be trivial. of
course, one can check that they are pure gauges and correspond to the at connection.
vanishing of the gauge eld (77) for this value of f conrms this.

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

30

the picture we obtained is the following. for dierent homomorphisms n : h  g
we constructed dierent invariant connections given by eqs. (73), (75) and (76). for
n 6= 1 or n = 1 with f = 0 the connection describes the su(2)-monopole solution
with the monopole number  = n. all su(2)-monopoles on s2 are reproduced in this
way. as it was said above the solutions with numbers  and () are gauge equivalent. in
addition, there is a continuous 1-parameter family of invariant connections which passes
through the congurations describing the su(2)-monopoles with numbers  = 1,  = 0
and  = 1 in the space of all connections of the theory. connections from this family
are described by eqs. (75), (76), (79) and (80). not all of these connections are gauge
inequivalent. classes of gauge equivalent invariant connections are labelled by values
of |f|. thus, |f| = 0 corresponds to the class of the  = 1 monopole. the monopole
with  = 1 can be obtained from it by the gauge transformation with the constant
matrix s = i1, as it was explained above, and, hence, belongs to the same gauge class.
connections with |f| = 1 form the class describing the monopole with  = 0.
we will study the wilson loop functional for this family of invariant connections
shortly. but before let us consider the third example.
example 3. g = so(3). let us recall that so(3) = su(2)/z2 and 1(so(3)) = z2.
according to the discussion in sect. 2

bso(3)(s2) = h 2(s2, z2) = z2,

so there are two non-equvalent principal bre bundles with the base s2 and the structure
group so(3): the trivial bundle p = s2  so(3) and the non-trivial one. this is in a
accordance with the topological classication of monopole solutions considered in refs.
[45], [44].

for the description of g = so(3) it is convenient to continue using 22 matrices with
the identication of elements g and (g). in this case from the explicit form of the group
homomorphisms, eq. (70) it follows that 2 must be integer. as in the previous example
the invariant connection is given by eqs. (73) for integer n 6= 1 and half-integer n and
by eqs. (75), (76) and (79) for n = 1. for  = n  z we have the same set of su(2)-
monopole solutions with integer monopole number and the 1-parameter family of invariant
connections as before. they are connections in the trivial bundle p = s2  so(3). for
half-integer  = n + 1/2, n  z the intertwining operator  = 0. eqs. (73) with n being
substituted by n + 1/2 describe monopoles with half-integer number  = n + 1/2. by
analyzing these potentials at the equator of the sphere one can easily check that they are
connections in the non-trivial bundle p (s2, so(3)). only the monopoles with  = 0 and
 = 1/2 are stable [43], [44]. the former belongs to the trivial and the latter belongs
to the non-trivial topological sector of the theory, which in their turn correspond to the
trivial and non-trivial so(3)-bundles over s2 respectively.

see [47] for more examples and alternative descriptions of the invariant connections.

let us return to the example with m = s2 and the gauge group g = su(2) and
calculate the contribution of the invariant connections to the functional integral giving

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop functional. for this we consider a family
of loops (0) on s2 labelled by the angle 0 given by

(0) = {(0, ), 0 = const, 0   < 2}.

these closed paths are parallel to the equator and are parametrized by the polar angle
. here for deniteness we consider the case when (0) lie in the neighbourhood u1,
i.e. 0  0  .

through exp(i) in the o-diagonal terms. this suggests that it can be compensated

and is an analog of the functional integral z(), eq. (4). it mimics the path-integral
quantization of the gauge model where the conguration space (the space of connections)
is nite-dimensional and consists of su(2) - invariant connections. the integral takes into
account the contribution of the monopoles with  = 0,1 and uctuations around them
along the invariant direction. the action for the invariant connection in the formula
above is given by eq. (78).

of course, the complete contribution of the invariant connections, described by eqs.
(75), (76) or eq. (79), to the true functional integral (4) is dierent because it includes also
contributions of all uctuations around them. calculation of the complete contribution is
beyond the scope of the present article. in the next section we are going to discuss which
part of the true vacuum expectation value < t(0) > is captured by < t(0) >inv.

we would like to make a few remarks. in ref. [49] it was argued that the faddeev-
popov determinant on invariant connections turns out to be zero, hence the contribution
of such connections to the functional integral vanishes. this issue was analyzed in [50]
in a dierent context, namely the authors considered similar quantization for su(2)-
invariant connections in (3 + 1) - dimensional ashtekars gravity. they found that zeros
of the faddeev-popov determinant, which are responsible for the vanishing of the deter-
minant, are cancelled by the contribution of the delta functions of constraints and the
path integral measure is regular on invariant connections.

the plot of the energy einv(e2v, s/v )   ln < t(0) >inv as a function of s/v for
two values of e2v is given in fig. 5. the analysis of eqs. (87) and (88) shows that this
function has the quadratic behaviour in s/v for 0 < s/v < (s/v ) < 1/2 (the value of
(s/v ) depends on (e2v ) and is about 0.35 for the plots in fig. 5). recall that we found
similar behaviour for the contribution of the abelian monopoles in sect. 3.

6 discussion of the results

in the present article we studied the vacuum expectation value < t > of the wilson loop
variable in two-dimensional pure yang-mills theories. firstly we discussed the calculation
of this quantity by various techniques. in the abelian case we expanded the functional
integral giving < t > in a sum over topological sectors of the theory. they are in 1-1
correspondence with non-equivalent principal bre bundles p (m, g). as a by-product we
obtained a classication of such bundles in terms of elements of the cohomology group
h 2(m, 1(g)), eq. (10). in fact, this classication is valid even for the case when m
is a two-dimensional cw-complex. the integrals over connections in each topological
sector were calculated semiclassically by expanding the action around the monopole con-
guration, representing this sector, and performing the gaussian integration over the
uctuations. of course, since the theory is abelian, the semiclassical approximation is
exact. this calculation was done entirely within the geometrical description of gauge
theories in terms of gauge connections in principal bre bundles and for an arbitrary
compact two-dimensional space-time m. this approach also allowed us to separate the
contribution of the monopoles.

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

34

in the case of an arbitrary gauge group g the calculation was carried on the lattice.
we performed it directly in terms of plaquette variables (holonomies for loops associated
to the plaquettes). relation (47) between the loops for a given two-dimensional manifold
induces the corresponding relation between the plaquette variables and the holonomies
for homotopically non-trivial loops which was imposed by inserting the -function. as
far as we know, such technique was not used before for the calculation of < t >. of
course, our result (58) agrees with the results of previous calculations [8] - [10]. general
expression for < t >, eq. (58), being specied to the gauge group g = u(1), reproduces
the result of sect. 3 thus proving that the functional integral for the abelian case is indeed
saturated by the sum over the topological sectors and does not contain any contributions
dierent from the instanton contributions and uctuations around them (including, of
course, the trivial perturbative sector).

in accordance with results of previous studies, we conrm that < t > has the area law
behaviour which is a characteristic feature of two-dimensional pure yang-mills theories.
namely, e(e2v, s/v ) =  ln < t > is linear in s/v , where s is a region surrounded by
the loop , v is the total area of the surface and e is the gauge coupling, in the interval
0 < s/v < (s/v ) (remember that m is a compact surface). the range where the
function e is almost linear depends on the value of e2v , and the larger e2v , the closer
to 1/2 (s/v ) is. thus for e2v = 20 (s/v )  0.45. the question we analyzed in this
article is the contribution of the monopoles and the invariant connections to e(e2v, s/v ).
the example with g = u(1) shows that the contribution of the monoples depends
quadratically on s/v for 0 < s/v < (s/v ). the linear behaviour of e(e2v, s/v ) for
(s/v )  1 comes from the contribution of uctuations. however, for s/v  (s/v )
higher corrections in s/v already become important and lead to the deviation from
the area law behaviour. the restauration of the area law for the complete function
e(e2v, s/v ) is the result of exact cancellation of the quadratic terms in s/v in the
sum of the contributions of the monoples and uctuations. in this sense the quadratic
dependence of the contribution of monopoles emon(e2v, s/v ) is an indicator of the area
law behaviour of the complete function.

similar analysis can be carried out in the non-abelian case. for g = su(2) and
g = so(3) the plots of e(e2v, s/v ) and emon(e2v, s/v ) are qualitatively the same as
in fig. 1 and we do not present them in this article. the only dierence is the interval of

the values of the functions. for emon(e2v, s/v ) we took just the sum pn exp(cid:16)s( a(n))(cid:17)
of the leading quasiclassical contributions of the non-abelian monopole solutions found
in sect. 5, where s( a(n)) is the action on these monopole solutions. we did not carry
out the detailed analysis of contributions of uctuations around the monopoles in these
cases. apparently the similarity with the abelian case arises from the fact that in a special
gauge (say, a1 = 0) the action of the theory becomes quadratic and we can expect the
factorization of the contribution of uctuations as in eq.
(18). we argue that again
the quadratic behaviour of emon(e2v, s/v ) in s/v for 0 < s/v < (s/v ) serves as an
indicator of the power law behaviour.

finally, we studied the class of invariant connections. in the case when the space-time
is the two-dimensional sphere, m = s2, and for the gauge groups g = u(1), su(2) and

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

35

so(3) we constructed all such connections and showed that they include all monopole
solutions existing in these theories. we saw that for the non-abelian cases in addition
to this the class of invariant connections contains a continuous family parametrized by
a nite number of parameters. remembering that invariant connections play important
role for certain problems of eld theory, we addressed the question which features of the
vacuum expectation value < t > of the wilson loop variable are captured by the sector
of such connections. for this we calculated < t > for the continuous family of invariant
connections. since the space of connections is nite dimensional the functional integral
reduces to an ordinary one. the function einv(e2v, s/v ) for such gauge theory with
nite number of degrees of freedom again has the quadratic behaviour in s/v .

it is interesting to study whether such relation between the quadratic behaviour of
the contribution of invariant connections and the area law dependence of the complete
function e(e2v, s/v ) maintains in higher dimensions. if this is the case, then an indi-
cation of the presence or absence of the area law dependence of the complete theory can
be obtained from the analysis of the much simpler nite dimensional sector of invariant
connections. we plan to study this issue in a future publication.

appendix a. dierential calculus on the lattice and
calculation of the wilson loop

in this section we present an alternative technique for the calculation of < t > in terms
of dierential forms on the lattice [51], [52] which is applicable for abelian gauge groups.
here we consider the case g = u(1).

lattice q-forms are functions dened on the q-cells of a two-dimensional lattice  with
values in an abelian group k. the set of such forms is denoted by q(, k), q = 0, 1, 2.
the loop  is characterized by the integer valued 1-form j whose values j(l) give
the number of times the loop passes through the link l  1 (taking into account the
orientation). the gauge potential is charcterized by the 1-form  whose values are real
numbers modulo 2. it is related to the gauge potential and the variables introduced in
sect. 4 through

gl = ei(l) = eierl

a,

gp = ylp

gl,

(a1)

where l and p denote links and plaquettes of  respectively.

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

36

the operators of the continuous case have their discrete counterparts on the lattice.
let us introduce the exterior derivative operator d and its adjoint  which map q-forms
to q + 1 and q  1 forms respectively:

d : q(, k)  q+1(, k),

 : q(, k)  q1(, k).

the action of d and  is dened by:

df (cq+1) = xcq
f (cq1) = xcq

i(cq+1, cq)f (cq),

i(cq, cq+1)f (cq),

where f  q(, k), cq  q and i is the incidence function introduced in sect. 4. the
operator d is zero on 2-forms and  is zero on 0-forms. let us introduce now the scalar
product of two q-forms f and h as < f, h >= pcq f (cq)h(cq). it is easy to verify that  and
d are adjoint to each other with respect to the scalar product: hf, dhi = hf, hi, where
f is a form one degree higher than h. the laplacian operator , mapping q-forms into
q-forms, is dened in a standard way as  = d + d. it is self-adjoint, hf, gi = hf, gi,
and positive-semidenite:

hf, fi = hdf, dfi + hf, fi = kdfk2 + kfk2.

one can easily check that the plaquette variable gp in eq. (a1) is equal to

gp = eid(p).

it can be shown that alternatively to the loop variables and the measure used in sect.

4, one can take  as the integration variables and d  ql d((l)) as the measure. then

the path integral (51) can be written as

z() = z dyp

exp{sp(gp)} exp(i < j,  >).

the action can be expressed through the fourier coecients bn(p) as in eq. (52). re-
member that now we are considering the case g = u(1), so the irreducible representations
are labelled by integers. since the action is symmetric bn(p) = bn(p)). then we have

bnp(p) exp (inpd(p)) exp (i < j,  >)

[bnp(p) exp (inpd(p))] exp (i < j,  >)

z() = z dyp xnp
= z d x{np}yp
= z dxs
(yp
= z dxs
(yp

bs(p)(p)) exp (i < s, d > +i < j,  >)

bs(p)(p)) exp (i < s  j,  >) ,

calculation of wilson loops in 2d y-m theories

37

where we have written the sum over congurations {np} (a conguration is a set of integers
np associated to the plaquettes) as a sum oves integer valued 2-forms s  2(, z). these
2-forms characterize surfaces on m. by integrating over (l) we obtain that

z() = xs

(yp

bs(p)(p))(s  j) = xs: s=j

(yp

bs(p)(p)).

in the sum above only the 2-forms which correspond to the surfaces whose border is the
loop  contribute. the expectation value of the wilson loop nally reads:

< t >= ps: s=j (qp bs(p)(p))
ps: s=0(qp bs(p)(p))

for the villain action (see eq. (49)) we obtain

.

< t >= ps: s=j expn e2
ps: s=0 expn e2

2 pp(s(p))2|p|o
2 pp(s(p))2|p|o

.

in the compact case due to the condition s = 0 only the surfaces which wrap the whole
lattice n times (n  z), i.e. whose 2-forms satisfy s(p) = n for all p  2, contribute to
the denominator. if the loop  is simple and is the boundary of a region in m, then the
condition s = j implies that the only forms which give non-zero contribution are those
which have the following two properties: 1) s is constant inside the regions bordered by
, i.e. s(p) = s(p) if both p and p lie either in the interior or in the exterior of ; 2)
s(p)s(p) = 1 (the sign depends on the relative orientation) when one of the plaquettes
p and p lies in the interior of the loop  and the other lies in the exterior of it. with this
results (46) and (58) are recovered.
