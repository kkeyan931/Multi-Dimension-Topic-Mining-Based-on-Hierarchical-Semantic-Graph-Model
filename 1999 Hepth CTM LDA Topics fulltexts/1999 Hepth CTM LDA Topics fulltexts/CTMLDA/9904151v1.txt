abstract

we investigate the connections between four-dimensional, n = 2 m-theory vacua constructed
as orbifolds of type ii, heterotic, and type i strings. all these models have the same massless
spectrum, which contains an equal number of vector multiplets and hypermultiplets, with
a gauge group of the maximal rank allowed in a perturbative heterotic string construction.
we nd evidence for duality between two type i compactications recently proposed and
a new heterotic construction that we present here. this duality allows us to gain insight
into the non-perturbative properties of these models. in particular we consider gravitational
corrections to the eective action.

1. introduction

in this work we consider ve dierent string constructions, which lead to the same low-
energy spectrum. this consists of a four-dimensional supergravity theory with two space-
time supersymmetries whose spectrum, besides the gravity multiplet, contains (when the
gauge group is broken to its cartan subgroup) 19 vector multiplets and 20 hypermultiplets.
this massless spectrum is obtained via compactication and orbifold projections from all
the known perturbative string constructions, namely the types iia/b, the heterotic, and the
type i. the gauge group being a broken phase of so(16)  so(16)1, this spectrum can be
obtained from both the heterotic strings, starting either from e8 e8 or from so(32). in all
these constructions the sypersymmetry and/or the gauge group are broken by z2 projections.
the type ii orbifolds are obtained either with projections which act symmetrically on the
right and left movers [1, 2, 3], giving rise to type iia or iib models, or with an asymmetric
projection, in which all the supersymmetries come only from the left movers. these orbifolds
are dual to one another: the type iia and iib are trivially related by the inversion of an
odd number of radii, the compactication being self-mirror; the type ii asymmetric orbifold
is instead related to these by a u-duality that exchanges perturbative and non-perturbative
moduli (see ref.[3]).

the type i orbifolds were recently constructed in ref.[4] as orientifolds of certain type
iib orbifolds, with a spontaneous breaking of the n = 8 supersymmetry. in ref.[4] they
are indicated respectively as the scherkschwarz breaking and the m-theory breaking
models.

leading to vanishing gauge beta-functions.

the heterotic orbifold, which we present here as a new construction, is an interesting
example of heterotic compactication in which, although the gauge group has maximal
rank, there are always, even away from the abelian point, an equal number of vector and
hypermultiplets,
it therefore behaves as the
higher-level, reduced rank models considered in refs.[5, 6]. we provide evidence of duality
between such heterotic orbifold and the above two type i models, which correspond to two
dierent, but continuously related phases of the heterotic theory. this allows us to see the
connection between the two models: their relation is non-perturbative from the point of view
of type i. thanks to the duality between these constructions, we are able to determine at
least part of the non-perturbative correction to the eective coupling constant of a special,
gravitational (r2) amplitude. as a byproduct, we determine also the u-duality group. in
particular, s-duality appears to be broken by the action of a freely acting projection applied
to the eleventh coordinate of m-theory.

the type iia and heterotic constructions, on the other hand, are not dual. this is
related to the fact that the type iia orbifold cannot be regarded as a singular limit of a k3
bration [2, 3]. however, even though these models cannot be compared for nite values of
the moduli, we argue that they correspond to two dierent phases, or regions in the moduli
space, of m-theory. these two regions are connected in the moduli space.

1when we speak of gauge group we mean, on the heterotic string, the part that comes from the currents.
for the sake of simplicity we always omit to mention the left and right gauge groups which come from the
compact space.

the above issues are discussed according to the following order:

in section 2 we review the type ii orbifolds, which were discussed in detail in ref.[3].
we discuss also the corrections to the r2 term, which, being a function of the moduli of the
vector manifold, will provide us with a quantity on which to test the duality relations.

in section 3 we recall, from ref.[4], the type i orientifolds, commenting on the addition
of discrete wilson lines which break the gauge group to the cartan subgroup and discussing
the gravitational corrections.

in section 4 we then discuss in detail the heterotic construction. as the previous sections,
also this ends with a discussion of the r2 corrections. through the analysis of this term, we
discuss also the duality relation between this model and the type i of section 3. the duality
relations are used to obtain (at least part of) the non-perturbative gravitational corrections,
as well as an insight into other non-perturbative properties.

finally, in section 5 we comment on the connections between the various phases of these

n = 2, m-theory compactications. our conclusions are given in section 6.

2. the type ii constructions

2.1. the type iia construction

we start by reviewing the construction of the type iia, which is obtained by compactication
of the ten-dimensional superstring on a calabiyau manifold with hodge numbers h1,1 =
h2,1 = 19 [1, 2]. we recall that this manifold has an orbifold limit in which the n = 8
supersymmetry of the type iia string compactied on t 6 is reduced to n = 2 by two z2
projections, z (1)
(3) is the following:

g(cid:3) is the z2-shifted (2, 2) lattice sum. in this case, the only shift is that due to

translation on t 2

(1), ()m2g2

.

for a detailed analysis of the spectrum of this model, we refer to ref.[3]. here we simply
recall that the z (1)
twisted sector has sixteen xed points, which give rise to eight vector
2
and eight hypermultiplets. the twist of z (2)
on the other hand is accompanied by a lattice
2
shift, so there are no massless states from this twisted sector. the other eight vector and
eight hypermultiplets come from the sector twisted by z (1)
(the h (1) + h (2)-twisted
sector).

we now consider the corrections to the r2 term. they receive a non-zero contribution
at one loop, and are related to the infrared-regularized integral of the fourth helicity super-
trace, b4 (for the denition and the details we refer, for instance, to ref.[3]). the one-loop
correction to the coupling constant is:

+14 log

m (iia)
(iia) ,

(2.4)

where t 1, t 2, t 3 are the kahler class moduli of the three tori of the compact space. the last
term in eq.(2.4), which encodes the infrared running due to the massless contributions, is
expressed in terms of the type iia string scale m (iia)  1/p
iia and infrared cut-o (iia).
the coecient, 14, is actually the massless contribution to (b4  b2)/3, as is computed in
eld theory (see ref.[6]). observe that there is no limit in the space of moduli t 1, t 2, t 3, at
which this correction reproduces the behaviour of an n = 4 orbifold, for which it is expected
to depend on the kahler class modulus of only one torus (see for instance refs.[7, 8]). this
implies that, in the space of these three moduli, there is no region in which the n = 4
supersymmetry is restored, as happens instead in orbifold constructions with a spontaneous
breaking of supersymmetry, such as those considered in refs.[6, 9]. there is therefore no
perturbative connection to an n = 4 theory, and therefore this orbifold cannot be seen as a
singular limit in the moduli space of a k3 bration [3].

3

as explained in ref.[3], the type iib dual compactication is trivially obtained by chang-
ing the chirality of the right-moving spinors. this is obtained by changing the phase
()a+b+ab in eq.(2.1) to ()a+b. the analysis is similar and we obtain analogous results,
with the role of the elds t i, i = 1, 2, 3, associated to the kahler classes of the three tori,
interchanged with that of the elds u i, associated to the complex structures.

2.2. the type ii asymmetric dual

the model above described possesses a type ii dual constructed as an asymmetric orbifold
[3], obtained by combining the projection z (1)
2 , acting in the same way as before, with z f
2 ,
which projects out all the right-moving supersymmetries by relating the action of the right
fermion number operator, ()fr, to a translation in the compact space. the partition
function reads [3]:

as was discussed in ref.[3], the r2 gravitational correction, which receives contribution only
from one loop, is a function of the moduli t as, u as, associated respectively to the kahler

are identically vanishing.

3. the type i models

there are two type i orbifolds that possess the desired massless spectrum. they were
constructed in ref.[4], as orientifolds of type iib orbifolds, with the n = 8 supersymmetry
spontaneously broken to n = 4 by a freely acting projection, z (f)
2 . the latter acts as a twist
on t 4, and, in the rst case, as a translation in the momenta, produced by the projection
()mgf
, on a circle of t 2. in ref.[4] this construction is called the scherkschwarz breaking
model; in the following we will refer to it as the model a. model b, referred to in ref.[4]
as the m-theory breaking model, is obtained when the translation is performed on the
windings instead. after the orientifold projection, the resulting type i models possess an
n = 4 supersymmetry spontaneously broken to n = 2. in model a the n = 4 is restored
in the limit of decompactication (large radius) of the circle translated by z (f)
2 ; in model b,
instead, it is restored when the radius goes to zero. because of the spontaneous nature of the
breaking of the n = 4 supersymmetry, the massless spectrum contains an equal number of
vector and hypermultiplets3 in the two models. however, while in model a the gauge group
consists only of factors arising from the contribution of 99-brane sector states, in model b
the consistency conditions of the construction, as derived by imposing tadpole cancellation,
require the presence of both d9- and d5-branes, and the gauge group is the product of the
99-brane sector and the 55-brane sector contribution.

model a, in which the gauge group is a broken phase of so(32), is expected to possess
a heterotic dual, and indeed we will construct such a dual in the next section. as explained
in [4], there is a wide choice of wilson lines compatible with this scherkschwarz projection,
leading to dierent breakings of the gauge group. in order to compare the type i and the
heterotic constructions, we introduce a further set of discrete wilson lines, which break
the gauge group to its cartan subgroup, u(1)16, 4. in this way we obtain 3 + nv vector
multiplets and 4 + nh hypermultiplets, with nv = nh = 16. it is possible to choose the
wilson lines to act as z2 shifts in the directions twisted by z (f)
2 . this choice corresponds
to a breaking of the gauge group at the n = 2, six-dimensional level, before the further
torus compactication and supersymmetry breaking via orbifold projection; these wilson
lines therefore do not enter the 2,18 lattice explicitly. the only vector multiplets moduli
that appear are those of the 2,2 lattice associated with the two-torus of the compactication
from six to four dimensions. we will test the duality with the heterotic construction of the
next section, through a comparison of the holomorphic gravitational corrections. these
are dened as the corrections to the eective coupling constant of a special combination of
r2 and f 2 terms [6, 9], namely

(3.1)

this combination was introduced in the above cited works in the context of heterotic orb-
ifolds; it was shown to possess an amplitude smooth in the moduli space, in which the
non-harmonic contributions to the r2 and the f 2 amplitudes cancel each other, leaving only

3as usual, we dont count here the three vector multiplets and the four hypermultiplets originating from

the compact space, which are common to all the n = 2 orbifolds we consider in this paper.

4here also we omit the contribution coming from the compact space.

the 2,2 (z2-shifted) lattice sum. this is due to the presence of the full bunch of states,
contained in the part of the heterotic spectrum which has, as massless excitations, the states
of the c = (0, 16) currents. on the type i side, the pure r2 amplitude, although smooth in
the moduli space, contains, besides the lattice sum provided by the torus t , the contribu-
tions of the klein bottle k, the annulus a and the mobius strip m [10][12]. however, only
n = 2 bps multiples contribute to such amplitudes, which therefore are all proportional to
a supersymmetric index [10]; for the combination of gravitational and gauge amplitudes
eq.(3.1), the k, a and m contributions cancel (notice that in the case of type i, the gauge
amplitude hff it 2 vanishes, because these states come from the rr sector of the type
iib string). the only contribution therefore comes from the torus t .
since in this model there are no d5-branes, we expect the tree-level eective coupling 1
g2
to be given by the imaginary part of only one complex eld, s = s1 + is2, whose real part
s1 is the scalar dual to b, while the imaginary part is

s2 = e4g1/42 ,

(3.2)

where 4 is the dilaton of the four-dimensional compactication, g  r4r5 is the volume

of the two-torus, and 4 is the volume of the k3, which in the case at hand is in his t 4/z2
limit. this situation has to be contrasted with the most general one [11, 13], in which the
coupling is given by a combination

vs2 + vs
2

(3.3)

2 = e4g1/42 is part of a complex eld s whose real part s

in which s
1 is the dual of
b45. the part of the coupling proportional to the inverse of the k3 volume is due to the
presence of d5-branes.

the one-loop contribution is given by the complex structure-dependent part of the in-
tegral, over the fundamental domain, of the 2,2, z2-shifted lattice sum appearing in the
t amplitude. this can be computed in an infrared-regularized background, as in ref.[14].
this would lead to the introduction of a curvature in the space-time, providing a cut-o 
that, once the at limit is taken, appears in the running of the eective coupling [14][16].
there is no need to go into the details of such a procedure: such a running is in fact xed by
a regularization prescription, which imposes the matching of eld theory and string compu-
tations in the infrared, and can therefore be determined simply by eld-theory arguments.
on the other hand, the full dependence of the corrections on the modulus u, the complex
structure of the torus t 2 and the only non-trivial modulus that appears in such terms, the
wilson lines being frozen to xed values, can be easily derived by knowing the action of
z (f)
2 on the torus [17]. the total result, including tree-level and one-loop contributions, is
therefore given by

grav((i))

= 16 2 im s  2 log im u |4 (u)|4 + 14 log
where the jacobi function 4 corresponds to a translation ()m2gf
, in the second circle of
t 2. the sl(2, z)u duality group is broken to a (2) subgroup (see refs.[6, 8, 9, 17]). in the
last term we collect the dependence on the infrared cut-o (i) and the type i string mass
scale m (i).

we now consider the m-theory breaking, model b. we specialize to the case in which,
with reference to the notation of ref.[4], n2 = d2 = 0, i.e. the symplectic factors do not
appear in the gauge group, which is therefore given by so(16)99  so(16)55 (the subscripts
indicate the origin of these factors). we now introduce wilson lines, as we did in the previous
case, to break so(16)99 to u(1)8. we also move the d5-branes a bit far from each other,
in order to break also the second factor to the cartan subgroup. we can now repeat the
same arguments as before and compute the analogous gravitational corrections. in this
case, due to the presence of the d5-branes, we expect a dependence of the tree level eective
coupling also on the eld s. we therefore obtain:

g2

= 16 2v im s + 16 2v im s  2 log im u |4 (u)|4 + 14 log

(3.5)

where, as in refs.[11, 12], we allow for the presence of two independent contributions to
the eective coupling constant (vv 6= 0). actually, since the model is symmetric under the
exchange of the d9- and the d5-branes sectors, we deduce that v = v = 1. the 4(u) is
obtained for a translation ()n1gf

on the windings of the rst circle of t 2.

3. the heterotic construction

we now discuss in detail the heterotic dual. this is constructed as a z2 freely acting orbifold
of the heterotic string compactied on t 6, with the gauge group broken to so(16) so(16)
by a z2, discrete wilson line. the type i construction corresponds to a special region in the
moduli space of the theory, and in order to be able to compare heterotic and type i, we must
choose on the heterotic side a special set of wilson lines. what we need is a set of three
other discrete wilson lines, which act on the compact space as z2 translations, and further
break so(16)  so(16) to u(1)8  so(4)4. the n = 4 supersymmetry is then reduced
to n = 2 by a further z2 freely acting projection, z (f)
2 , which moreover acts as a further
wilson line, which breaks the gauge group, leaving massless only the bosons in the cartan
subgroup. the partition function, zhet, can be easily written in terms of the usual fermionic
and bosonic characters for the compact space and the c = (0, 2), so(4) twisted characters
introduced in ref.[6], f1 and f2, for the c = (0, 16) currents. we recall that:

with this embedding, the shift in 2,2 is produced by the projection ()m2gf +n2g1 5. the
conformal blocks in the second line of eq.(3.7) provide the right-moving part of eight vector
multiplets, corresponding to a factor u(1)8 in the gauge group, and sixteen hypermultiplets.
from the blocks on the r.h.s. of the rst line we get the other eight vectors, to make
u(1)16, and no further hypermultiplets. in addition to these, the massless spectrum of the
model contains the usual three vector multiplets and four hypermultiplets of an ordinary
t 2  t 4/z2 compactication of the heterotic string. thanks to the free action of all the
projections, there are no additional massless states coming from the twisted sectors. it is
worth remarking that, when some of the wilson lines are absent, the gauge group is enlarged
but still nv = nh . notice that, because of the embedding of the spin connection into the
gauge group, it is not possible to construct this model at the point so(16)  so(16), but
only at a broken phase of it.

it is easy to recognize that the n = 2 sector of this orbifold, specied by (h f, gf) 6= (0, 0),
belongs to the same universality class as the n = 2 heterotic constructions with nv = nh ,
considered in refs.[6, 9]. in fact, the modular transformation properties of the untwisted
2,2 lattice, toghether with the condition nv = nh , as was already pointed out in ref.[6],
are sucient to x this orbifold sector uniquely, the dierence between the various models
residing in the n = 4 sector. a consequence of this is that not only the n = 2 singularities,
but also all the threshold corrections that receive contribution only from this sector, are the
same as for the other models of this class; we therefore skip the details about the analysis
of this model and go directly to the discussion of the gravitational corrections.

as we anticipated in section 2, it was pointed out in refs.[6, 9] that the pure gravita-
tional amplitude, hr2i, must be corrected with a term proportional to the gauge amplitude,
hff i, in order to make it holomorphic and non-singular. we recall here that the precise
combination is:

5as in refs.[6, 9], there exists also an alternative heterotic construction with the same massless spectrum,
in which the spin connection is embedded in the right u (1)2 factor from the untwisted two-torus. in this
case, the shift in 2,2 is produced by an asymmetric projection, e.g. ()(m1+n1)gf
. we will not consider this
alternative construction, because it is not dual to the type i.

9

owing to the free action of the projection z (f)

2 , also in this model the n = 4 supersymme-
try is spontaneously broken perturbatively [18]; it is restored when t  , u  . this
limit corresponds, as in the type i construction, to a decompactication to ve dimensions 6.
in order to compare this model with the type i, scherkschwarz breaking model a of the
previous section, we consider the limit in which t is large while u is kept nite (we stress
that in this limit the supersymmetry remains broken to n = 2). in this limit, the correction
eq.(3.10) depends on t only logarithmically:

16 2
grav((het))  16 2 im s(het)  2 log im u |4 (u)|4 + o(log im t ) .

g2

(3.12)

if we discard this logarithmic dependence for the moment, we see that eq.(3.12) exactly
reproduces the type i correction given in eq.(3.4), with the identications s(het)  s and
u (het)  u (i). we can interpret the logarithmic dependence as due to eects that are
non-perturbative from the type i point of view7. the limit of restoration of the n = 4
supersymmetry, in both the theories, corresponds to the decompactication of one radius
(r  ). in this limit, also u  , and the eective coupling constant, in the n = 4
phase, depends only on the dilaton s = s(het), as expected in both the theories8. we consider
the coincidence of the massless spectrum and the rather non-trivial correspondence of these
threshold corrections as compelling evidence of the duality of the heterotic and the type i,
model a constructions9.

we now consider the limit t  0, with u xed.

in this limit, the theory is better
described in terms of the inverse modulus t  1/t . by performing an sl(2, z) inversion,
the second term in eq.(3.10) becomes

,

 2 log im t (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2(cid:16) t(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

which diverges linearly when im t is large:

(3.14)
6when re t = re u = 0, we have im t  r1r2 and im u  r2/r1, where r1, r2 are the radii of the
two circles of the torus. in this case this limit corresponds to r2  , with r1 xed.
7this is the same phenomenon as that appearing in the examples of type iia/type ii asymmetric orbifolds
dualities considered in refs.[3, 8, 9], where the absence of tree level dilaton dependence in the analogous cor-
rections on the asymmetric orbifolds indeed corresponds to a logarithmic dependence due to non-perturbative
phenomena.

8still, there is the presence of the logarithmic terms, both in t and u . these terms can be lifted by

switching on an appropriate cut-o, as is discussed in refs.[3, 6, 9, 19].

9in the construction with the asymmetric shift in 2,2 referred to in footnote 5, there are lines, t = f (u ),
in the (t, u ) space, along which the smooth gravitational amplitude we are considering indeed becomes
singular. this is due to the appearance in the massless spectrum of new hypermultiplets, which are uncharged
under the gauge group of the torus, and therefore lead to a jump in the -function of the r2 term, which is
not compensated by an opposite jump in the -function of f 2 (see refs.[6, 17]). by duality, these singularities
should appear also on the type i side, where new massless states should appear for large or small values of
the modulus u . the absence of these rules out the alternative heterotic construction.

10

therefore, for large im s(het) and small t , eq.(3.10) becomes

s (we have introduced here as usual the eld  

it is tantalizing to interpret the linear divergence in the eld t as corresponding to the
appearance of a d5-brane sector in the dual type i theory.
indeed, in this region of the
moduli space, the eective coupling constant of the heterotic theory behaves like that of the
m-theory breaking type i model b, eq.(3.5), provided we identify the eld s(het) with
s, as before10 and t with 8s = 2 
s, in
analogy with the eld s = 4s, the actual dilatonaxion eld that enters the sl(2, z),
montonenolive duality transformations). as before, we can identify the complex structure
moduli u of the heterotic and type i constructions. it therefore seems that, for large t , the
heterotic theory is perturbatively dual to the type i construction b. this correspondence is
better understood in terms of the t-dual heterotic theory, obtained by exchanging the two
radii of the torus, r1  r2, and then inverting them: r1  r1 = 1/r1, r2  r2 = 1/r2.
with these inversions, we remain in a spontaneously broken phase of the so(16)  so(16)
string, but with the kahler class modulus of the torus given by t instead of t . the modulus
t is coupled to the windings of the torus of this t-dual theory, and in the limit of large im t
all the string states with a non-zero winding number decouple from the spectrum, leaving
only the kaluzaklein states, of the type i dual string11.

the above duality implies in this example that the massless states of the 55-branes sector
appear on the heterotic side as perturbative states associated to the gauge currents, on the
same footing as the states of the 99-branes sector. the situation is therefore rather dierent
from that of the models of gimon and polchinski [20], in which the states of the 55-branes
sector are non-perturbative on the heterotic side [21, 22]. a solution to this (apparent)
puzzle comes from considering the t-dual, type i picture [4], in which the two gauge factors
are provided by the two horavawitten walls of the m-theory, s1/z2 orbifold, where the
d9-branes on one wall are wrapped on a t-dualized four-torus, and eectively appear as
d5-branes. nevertheless, because of their origin, the states corresponding to open strings
ending on these d-branes are expected to appear as perturbative states on the heterotic
theory12.

we can now try to see what happens from the type i side point of view when the heterotic
theory passes from small to large t (or equivalently from large to small t ). because of the
identications

s(het) = s = e4g1/42 ,

t = 8s = 8e4g1/42 ,

(3.16)

we have 8s(het)/ t = s/s = 4. we therefore see that such a motion, performed while
keeping the eld s(het) xed, corresponds on the type i side to increasing the volume of

10here, by an abuse of language, we are using the same notation, s, for both the type i constructions.
11this limit can also be viewed as the innite-tension limit of the heterotic string. we have in fact
im t  r1 r2/, im u  r2/ r1, and the limit im t   with u xed is equivalent to the limit   0
with xed radii.
12we thank e. dudas for a clarication of this point.

11

the k3, 4  . in order to keep the eld s xed, we have also to shrink the volume of
the two-torus and/or adjust the value of the dilaton 4. in order to remain in the phase of
broken n = 4 supersymmetry, we must shrink the second circle, leaving the rst one xed.
notice that, according to eq.(3.3), this motion is non-perturbative from the type i point of
view, involving a change of the tree-level coupling constant. in this limit, which corresponds
to an eective decompactication of the theory to eight dimensions (or nine, if a circle of
the two-torus is shrinked), indeed the d5-branes look like d9-branes wrapped around the
t 2 torus. the u(1) gauge bosons, which were provided by open strings ending on the same
d5-brane, are still there; they contribute for a u(1)8 factor to the gauge group, although
they must now be reinterpreted as due to strings ending on d9-branes. what essentially
distinguishes the behaviour of this model with respect to the type i constructions, in which
supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken, as in refs.[20, 23], is that there is an unbroken
s-duality in those cases; combined with the symmetry under exchange of the elds s and
s, i.e. of the 99- and 55-branes sectors, this duality implies that, along such a motion, non-
perturbative phenomena enter heavily in the game and, at the limit we are considering, the
theory is perturbatively described by the s-, s-dual, identical theory. in our case, instead,
we expect s-duality to be broken, because, as explained in ref.[4], the type i model b indeed
corresponds to a scherkschwarz mechanism applied to the 11-th dimension of m-theory13.
it is then reasonable to nd that in this limit, since model b is not falling back into itself,
it ends up to coincide with model a, in which all the gauge bosons of u(1)16 are provided
by the d9-branes14.

we now consider the restoration of the n = 4 supersymmetry. the higher amount of
supersymmetry can be restored essentially in two ways, which correspond on the type i side
to the two decompactications: r2   in model a and r1  0 in model b. in the
rst case, the restoration is perturbative in both the type i and the heterotic side (the eld
s  ). in the second case, the restoration is non-perturbative from both the type i and
heterotic points of view (s, s  0). there are, however, also intermediate possibilities,
which involve a change also of . in these cases, the restoration, although non-perturbative
on the type i side, can look perturbative on the heterotic side. this happens when the
product g1/42 is kept xed.

non-perturbative corrections

we have seen that through the duality between heterotic and type i constructions, we gained
insight into the non-perturbative behaviour of both of them, at least regarding the restoration
of the n = 4 supersymmetry. we now try to go further: indeed, through the heterotic dual,
we learned that the two type i constructions are actually two realizations of the same theory.

13we will come back to this point, which contradicts the results of ref.[24].
14in order to understand how in this limit the d5-branes can look like d9-branes, consider the t-dual

situation in which the four circles of t 4(cid:14)z2 are t-dualized. in this case, for nite values of the radii, the

d9-branes become d5-branes and vice versa. however, when the radii are shrunk to zero, the theory lives
eectively in four extended and two compact dimensions, where there are no 9-branes but only 5-branes
wrapped around the compact torus. t-dualizing again the four circles brings us back to the original limit,
in which all the d5-branes become d9-branes.

12

the type i/heterotic duality can be used to get insight into the non-perturbative corrections
to the eective coupling constant of the combination of gravitational and gauge amplitudes
given in eq.(3.1). from the heterotic dual we know that the sl(2, z)s  duality group is
broken to a (2) subgroup. on the heterotic side the (2)t  (2)u group is by construction
a symmetry that remains valid at any value of the coupling. on the other hand, we know that
the type i m-theory breaking model b, is perturbatively symmetric under the exchange
of the elds s and s: this is a consequence of the symmetry under the exchange of the d9-
and d5-branes sectors. we claim that this implies that also the sl(2, z)s duality group is
indeed broken in the same way as the sl(2, z)s  group. this statement, which promotes a
perturbative symmetry to a non-perturbative one, is supported by the observation that, as
is discussed in ref.[4], in the t-dual, type i picture, the two contributions come from the
two horavawitten walls of the m-theory on s1/z2, and the symmetry of the problem
under exchange of the two remains true at any value of the 11-th coordinate. once observed
that the symmetry of the theory is (2)2s  (2)2s   (2)u times the permutations of the
three factors, we can write the full, non-perturbative correction, which reduces to eq.(3.10)
in the large-s limit:

in this expression we used the type i elds s = 4s,  
s = 4s and u, which by now

in each of the limits in which the n = 4 supersymmetry is perturbatively restored (either
on the heterotic or on both sides), the contribution of two moduli drops out (it reduces to the
already mentioned logarithmic dependence) and the correction eq.(3.17) diverges linearly
as a function of only one modulus (the eld s, as expected for n = 4 corrections). the
term e(2s, 2 
s, u) is suppressed in the limits of a restoration of supersymmetry. by using
its symmetry properties it is easy to see that it is suppressed also in the non-perturbative
limit s  0. the form of eq.(3.17) therefore tells us that there exists a limit, which is non-
perturbative on both the heterotic and type i sides, in which there is an eective restoration
of an n = 8 supersymmetry. this takes place when the three moduli contributions drop
out, namely when s  0, s  0 and u  . this for instance happens when, in model
b, we send r1 to zero while keeping , r2 and the eld 4 xed. in this case the eective
coupling eq.(3.17) vanishes (modulo the usual logarithmic divergences).

13

through the above analysis we have learned that in this theory, which can be interpreted
as obtained by a freely acting projection of m-theory, the u-duality group sl(2, z)s 
sl(2, z)t  sl(2, z)u is indeed broken. in particular, the s-duality is broken to a (2)2s
subgroup. this is in contrast with the results of ref.[24], in which, even in the presence of
a scherkschwarz compactication of the 11-th coordinate of m-theory, s-duality remains
unbroken. we believe that, once properly treated, a freely acting projection applied on
the 11-th coordinate must instead necessarily break the s-duality. the result of ref.[24] is
obtained by using as a starting point the eective horavawitten action, in which the space-
time metric appearing in the gauge terms, which live on the two ten-dimensional walls, is
a coordinate-independent restriction of the eleven-dimensional metric to ten dimensions.
in this way, the heterotic dilaton has no dependence on the 11-th radius. this scenario is
correct for a genuine horavawitten orbifold of m-theory, in which the original amount of
supersymmetry can never be restored by a decompactication of the eleventh dimension.
this is, however, not the case of a scherkschwarz compactication of m-theory, in which
we expect the supersymmetry to be restored in the large-radius limit (as happens in our
present case, where the radius of m-theory is t-dual to the r1 of model b). in this limit,
the gauge bosons of the terms introduced to cancel the ten-dimensional anomaly should
decouple. this is indeed what happens in our case, and is consistent with general arguments
that x the relation between the four-dimensional couplings and the eleventh radius  to be

where we have omitted the factors that contain all the other parameters.

as a last point, we remark that the model is symmetric under permutations of the elds
x = 8s, y = 8s and 1/u. by proceeding as in ref.[9], it is therefore possible to
calculate (at least a part of) the non-perturbative prepotential. this is obtained by a proper
symmetrization of the perturbative prepotential, computed, as a function of the moduli t
and u, on the heterotic side. the result is the same as in ref.[9].

5. discussion

in the previous section we were able to determine part of the non-perturbative behaviour of
the gravitational corrections. in order to determine also the term e(2s, 2 
s, u) in eq.(3.17),
we would need to identify a type iia dual, in which these three elds would belong to the
perturbative moduli. this would allow us to repeat the analysis of refs.[6, 7, 9, 27].
in
order for the duality to work, such a type iia dual would have to be constructed as a
compactication on (an orbifold limit of) a k3 bration [28][30]. a necessary condition
is therefore a symmetric breaking of the supersymmetry; this requirement leads directly to
the type iia orbifold of section 2. however, the heterotic and the type iia orbifolds under
consideration cannot be compared for nite values of the heterotic moduli t and u. this
is related to the fact that the compact space of the type iia orbifold, a t 6/(z2  z2) limit
of cy 19,19, cannot be seen as a singular limit of a k3 bration (see refs.[1][3]). indeed,
the spaces of the vector moduli of the two models do not correspond. a signal of the non-
coincidence of these subspaces is provided by the absence of a perturbative super-higgs

phenomenon on the type iia construction: unlike in the heterotic model, on the type iia
side it is not possible to restore the n = 4 supersymmetry in a corner of the space of
moduli t i, u i, i = 1, 2, 3 15. however, these models can be viewed as dierent phases of
a single theory, corresponding to dierent regions of a wider moduli space16. these two
regions are connected at the limits im t 2  0,, im t 3  0, of the type iia moduli
space, for any value of the modulus t 1. in these limits, the type ii correction, eq.(2.4),
reproduces the heterotic/type i, eq.(3.17), at the appropriate corners in the space of moduli
t and u ( im t, im u  0 and/or ). for any value of t 1, we have the identications
t 1 =  as
indeed, for any value of this modulus, there are two branches of
the theory: a branch corresponds to a heterotic/type i phase, with moduli t, u; crossing
the borders at im t, im u  0,, one passes to another branch, which corresponds to
the type ii phase, described by the type iia or type ii asymmetric orbifolds, with moduli
t 2, t 3. we can gain a deeper understanding of the reason why the heterotic and the type
iia constructions cannot be dual, if we consider the relation between these heterotic/type
i constructions and the heterotic/type iia, s, t, u models with nv = hh = 0 of ref.[9],
which also possess a spontaneously broken n = 8 supersymmetry. in that case, the spectrum
is simply the truncation of the n = 8 supergravity, and the restoration of the n = 8
supersymmetry, which is non-perturbative from the heterotic point of view, being related
to a motion in the dilaton eld s, necessarily appears as perturbative on the type iia side,
where the eld s is the volume form of the k3 bration. indeed, on the type iia side, the
spontaneous breaking of the n = 8 supersymmetry is due to a perturbative scherkschwarz
mechanism realized through freely acting projections, and is therefore directly related to
the absence of extra massless states coming from orbifold twisted sectors. on the other
hand, the heterotic/type i theory considered in this paper is an interesting example of (non-
perturbative) spontaneous breaking of the n = 8 supersymmetry, which, possessing an
enlarged gauge group, cannot correspond to a truncation of the type iia, n = 8 spectrum,
but is directly related to another phase of the m-theory. the two phases are interpolated
by switching on and turning o wilson lines, which act as freely acting z2 projections
twisting all the gauge bosons of the two horavawitten planes. as is clear from the
partition function given in eqs.
(4.2)(4.8) of ref.[9], they appear on the heterotic side
as n = 4 wilson lines y , which act on the twisted coordinates, corresponding to the
hypermultiplets. switching on/o these wilson lines involves a blowing up of the moduli
frozen at the xed points of t 4/z2 and a motion to another t 4/z2 singularity17. such a
motion is on the other hand non-perturbative from the type iia point of view, the moduli
associated to y including the dual of the type ii dilaton eld.

the type ii constructions of section 2, on the other hand, correspond to a limit in the
moduli space in which the n = 8 supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken; in this limit,
according to ref.[4], on the type i picture, the combined action of the z2 which acts as
a translation on the 11-th coordinate of m-theory, breaking n = 8 to n = 4, and that

15as is discussed in ref.[3], compactication on a k3 bration and spontaneous breaking of the n = 4

supersymmetry are directly related.

16we consider here only the space of moduli belonging to the vector multiplets.
17this necessarily involves passing through a n = 4 phase of the model, so that the results of ref.[9] for

the r2 correction cannot be used to rule out the term e(2s, 2 

s, u ) in eq.(3.17).

of the z2 which further breaks to n = 2, is no longer free. from a perturbative point of
view, the region of the moduli space corresponding to this limit is achieved at the above
specied corners in the space of moduli t 2, t 3 (or t (het), u (het)), where the two theories can
be connected. the above discussion is sketched in fig. 1.

6. conclusions

in this paper we investigated the connections between several four-dimensional string con-
structions with the same massless spectrum, namely an n = 2 supergravity with 3 + nv
vector multiplets and 4 + nh hypermultiplets, and nv = nh = 16. this spectrum is ob-
tained via type iia/b, heterotic and type i orbifold compactications. we found evidence
that the two type i constructions with spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry, presented
in ref.[4], namely the n = 2 scherkschwarz and m-theory breaking models, indeed
constitute two phases of the same theory, and are non-perturbatively related by a motion in

sector. this relation appears as perturbative on the heterotic dual construction. collecting
the knowledge coming from the heterotic model and the type i duals, we got some insight
into the non-perturbative aspects of this theory. in particular, we discovered the existence
of a non-perturbative super-higgs phenomenon responsible for the spontaneous breaking of
the n = 8 supersymmetry. this is consistent with the interpretation of the theory as due
to a scherkschwarz mechanism applied to the 11-th dimension of the m-theory. this
mechanism is also responsible for the breaking of the sl(2, z), montonenolive s-duality,
to a (2) subgroup, and it reects on the dilaton dependence of string corrections to eec-
tive coupling constants, as the gravitational ones we considered. on the other hand, these
constructions do not possess type ii duals. indeed we show that the type iia, type ii asym-
metric orbifolds with the same massless spectrum actually correspond to a dierent phase
of the m-theory. the two phases are connected at certain corners in the moduli space.
