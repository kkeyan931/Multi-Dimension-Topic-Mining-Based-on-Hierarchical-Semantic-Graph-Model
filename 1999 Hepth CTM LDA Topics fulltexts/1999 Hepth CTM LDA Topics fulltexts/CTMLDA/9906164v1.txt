abstract

we nd static spherically symmetric dyons in einstein-born-infeld-higgs
model in 3 + 1 dimensions. the solutions share many features with the gravi-
tating monopoles in the same model. in particular, they exist only up to some
critical value of a parameter  related to the strength of the gravitational in-
teraction. we also study dyonic non-abelian black holes. we analyse these
solutions numerically.

1 introduction

gravitating non-abelian solitons has attracted much attention recently after the dis-
covery of particle like solutions in einstein-yang-mills (eym) theory[1] by bartnik
and mckinnon (for a review see ref.[2]). similar to the bartnik-mckinnon particles,
the eym model also admit black hole solutions with nontrivial yang-mills connec-
tion [3, 4, 5]. these are called non-abelian black holes. unfortunately, in spher-
ically symmetric su(2) eym theory there is neither globally regular solution nor
black hole [6] with non-abelian monopole or dyon charge other than the embedded
reissner-nordstrom (rn) solution. however, monopole solutions were studied in
the einstein-yang-mills-higgs (eymh) model [7, 8, 9, 10] as a generalization of the
t hooft-polyakov monopole[11, 12] to see the eect of gravity on it. numerical analy-
sis showed that they exist only up to some critical value of a dimensionless parameter
, characterising the strength of the gravitational interaction. the existence of these
solutions were proved analytically[9] for the case of innite higgs mass. magnetically
charged non-abelian black holes were also found in this model[13, 14]. as a general-
ization of these above solutions, it was shown that the eymh model admits dyons as
well as dyonic black hole solutions[15, 16]. like the monopole solutions these dyons
also exist only up to some critical value of .

recently the born-infeld[17, 18] model has been widely studied in string theory.
it was shown that the low energy eective action for d-brane[19] is described by
the born-infeld action[20, 21, 22]. solitons of the born-infeld action correspond to
the intersection of branes[23, 24, 25]. the born-infeld action is generalized for non-
abelian vector elds and it was shown that the action is linearised [26] by the bps
conguration if it has a symmetrised trace structure[27]. the supersymmetric action
for this was constructed and the connection of bps relation with supersymmetry
was also discussed[28]. the existence of gravitating monopoles as well as magneti-
cally charged non-abelian black holes is shown in einstein-born-infeld-higgs (ebih)
model for static spherically symmetric elds[29].

just as in eymh case[15, 16], both monopole and dyon solution exist in the same
model, it is worthwhile enquiring if the ebih model[29], which admit monopole and
magnetically charged black hole also admit dyon and dyonic black hole. the purpose
of this paper is to answer the question in armative. motivated by these, we consider
the ebih model[29] and study the dyon and dyonic non-abelian black hole solutions.
we nd that the solutions are similar to those for the eymh case[15, 16]. in sec.ii
we consider the model and nd the equations of motion. in sec.iii we analyse them
numerically and nally we conclude the results in sec.iv.

2 the model

we consider the following einstein-born-infeld-higgs action[29] for su(2) elds with
the higgs eld in the adjoint representation

s = z d4xg [lg + lbi + lh ]

with

lg =

the symmetric trace is dened as

where the sum is over all permutations on the product of the n generators ti. unlike
the monopole case we have here f f  6= 0. expanding the square root in powers
of 1

we consider the static spherical symmetric solutions for which the metric can be
parametrized as[30, 9]

ds2 = e2(r)dt2 + e2(r)dr2 + r2(r)(d2 + sin2 d2)

the ansatz for the gauge and the scalar elds are

we obtain the following expression for the lagrangian after putting the above ansatz
in eq.(1) and rescaling r  r/ev,   ev2 and r(r)  r(r)/ev,

here the prime denotes dierentiation with respect to r. the dimensionless param-

(14)
with the gauge eld mass mw = ev and the planck mass mp l = 1/g . note that
the higgs mass mh = 2gev. in the limit of    the above action reduces to that

of the eymh model. for the case of  = 0 we must have (r) = 0 = (r) which
corresponds to the at space born-infeld-higgs theory. from now on we restrict
ourselves to the gauge choice r(r) = r, corresponding to the schwarzschild-like
coordinates and rename r = r. we dene a = e+ and n = e2. integrating the tt
component of the energy-momentum tensor, which is obtained by varying the matter
eld action with respect to the metric, we get the mass of the dyon equal to m/evg

as expected, the above equations reduce to those for the monopoles[29] if we put
j = 0. also they reduce to the corresponding dyonic equations for eymh case[15, 16]
in the limit of   . the equations for eymh system admit embedded rn
solutions.
in this case we have the following generalized embedded rn solutions
satisfying the above equations of motion for nite values of  :

rh

obtained by demanding n(rh) = 0. inverting this relation, we obtain

rh = r0 +

with r0 = m +qm 2  2(1 + q2) and hence the solution exist for m > 1 + q2.
this implies that unlike the  =  case where the extremal black holes exist with
m = 1 + q2, the equality does not hole for nite .

3 solutions

3.1 dyons

we rst consider the globally regular solutions to the equations of motion. for the
solutions to be regular at the origin we have

n(0) = 1,

(28)

and

h(0) = 0, w (0) = 1,

j(0) = 0.

for asymptotically at solutions we require

n() = 1

and then for nite energy conguration the matter elds approach the values

h() = 1, w () = 0,

j() = j

(29)

(30)

(31)

where j is a constant.

we solved the equations numerically for various values of  keeping  and g xed.
for large r these solutions converge to their asymptotic values. for  = 0 they
correspond to the at space dyons. the behaviour of the solutions for   0 are
similar to those for the globally regular monopole solutions[29]. they exist up to
some critical value of  above which there is no solution. the minimum of the metric
function n is found to be decreasing as  is increased gradually from zero to max
and becomes zero at  = max. for g = .1 and  = 4 we nd max  1.7. the at
space solutions for dyons, corresponding to the value  = 0 are given in figs.1 and
2. the prole for the elds for various values of , (0 <  < max) with g = .1 and
 = 4 are shown in figs.3,4,5 and 6.

3.2 dyonic black holes

apart from the globally regular solutions the ebih model also admit dyonic black
holes. the event horizon is charecterised by some nite rh for which n(rh) = 0 and
a(rh) is nite. the matter functions at rh must satisfy the following conditions.

j(rh) = 0,

they follow the same behaviour as the globally regular solutions in the region of
large r as given in eqs.(30) and (31). with these boundary conditions we solve the
equations numerically. they have many features in common with the magnetically
charged black holes. in particular, for rh close to zero, the solutions approach to the
regular dyon solutions. the prole for the elds are given in fig.7.

4 conclusion

in the present work we have investigated gravitating dyons in the ebih model. we
derived a generalized expression for the embedded rn solitons. apart from this em-
bedded abelian solution there are also non-abelian solutions. in particular, we found
that globally regular dyons exist only up to some critical value max of the parameter
. we also found the dyonic non-abelian black hole solutions. the solutions are
similar to the corresponding monopoles and magnetically charged non-abelian black
holes. it would be interesting to prove the existence of the solutions analytically.
