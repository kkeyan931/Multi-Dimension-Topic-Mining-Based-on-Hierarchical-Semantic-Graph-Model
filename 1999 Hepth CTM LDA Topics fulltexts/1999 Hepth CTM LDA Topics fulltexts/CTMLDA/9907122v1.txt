abstract

we perform a 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation
based on sazdjians explicitly covariant propagator, combined with a co-
variant substitute of the projector on the positive-energy free states. we
use this combination in the two fermions in an external potential and in the
three-fermion problems. the covariance of the two-fermion propagators
insures the covariance of the two-body equations obtained by switching
o the external potential, or by switching o all interactions between any
pair of two fermions and the third one, even if the series giving the 3d
potential is limited to the born term or more generally truncated. the co-
variant substitute of the positive energy projector preserves the equations
against continuum dissolution without breaking the covariance.

the bethe-salpeter equation [1, 2] is the usual tool for the study of relativistic
bound states. the principal diculty in the treatment of this equation comes
from the existence of unphysical relative time variables. although the bethe-
salpeter equation can be directly studied when the bethe-salpeter kernel is
simple (one can perform the wick rotation) or replaced by a separable ker-
nel, the most usual practice in the two-fermion problem consists in eliminating
the relative time variable (3d reduction). this 3d reduction can be based on
an instantaneous replacement of the bethe-salpeter kernel (by an expression
independent of the relative energy), on an instantaneous replacement of the free
green function (by an expression combining a delta xing the relative energy
and a 3d propagator) or on both. the exact equivalence (in what concerns
the physically measurable quantities of the pure two-fermion problem) with the
original bethe-salpeter equation can be obtained by recuperating the dierence
with the original bethe-salpeter kernel and/or free green function in a series of
correction terms to the 3d potential.

the 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation has been per-
formed by many authors [3-19]. all methods are theoretically equivalent at the
limit of all correction terms included. beyond the two-fermion problem, we have
the cases of two fermions in an external potential ( 2 1
2body problem) and of
three fermions (3-body problem). in these cases we meet new diculties which

2

do not appear or can be easily solved in the two-fermion case: the lorentz in-
variance / cluster separability problem, the continuum dissolution problem and
the hermiticity problem.

 lorentz invariance and cluster separability. it is always possible to render
an equation lorentz invariant by working in the general rest frame (center of
mass reference frame) and by building invariants with the total 4-momentum
vector, although the result may be unelegant and articial. the lorentz invari-
ance requirement becomes a tool when combined with the cluster separability
requirement: when all mutual interactions are switched o, we must get a set
of three free dirac equations. this total separability can easily be obtained by
using as hamiltonian the sum of three free dirac hamiltonians and three mutual
interaction terms. the real diculty appears when only the interactions with
fermion 3 (for example) are switched o. if we want a full cluster separability,
the resulting equation for the (12) cluster can not refer to the global center of
mass frame anymore, as the momentum of fermion 3 enters in the denition of
this frame.

lorentz invariance and cluster separability can be explicit or implicit (via
rearrangements). the best known example of implicit lorentz invariance is a
free dirac equation solved with respect to the energy: it becomes explicitly co-
variant by multiplication with the  matrix. other implicit lorentz invariances
are not that trivial. for example, the 3d reductions of a bethe-salpeter equa-
tion are implicitly covariant, provided the series generated by this reduction are
not truncated.

in fact, the homogeneous bethe-salpeter equation from which we shall start
does not obey cluster separability: this equation is valid for two-fermion bound
states only, i.e. for a total energy below the continuum. our 3d equation will
thus be used in the computation of three-fermion bound states. a priori, it
will not necessarily give also the correct scattering amplitudes or obey cluster
separability, even with all higher-order terms included. we shall nevertheless
try to get a 3d equation which is also valid in the contunuum region.

 solution of the continuum dissolution problem. in the relativistic equa-
tions for several relativistic particles, the physical bound states are degenerate
with a continuum of states combining asymptotically free particles with oppo-
site energy signs. this often neglected fact forbids the building of normalizable
solutions in the n > 2-body problem (including the two-body plus potential
problem. in the pure two-body problem the mixing is prevented by the con-
servation of the total momentum). the usual solution consists in including
positive-energy projection operators into the zero-order propagator [20-26]. the
modied equations must of course continue to satisfy the other requirements,
like the lorentz invariance / cluster separability requirement.

 hermiticity and total energy independence of the interaction terms. in
the two-body problem, nonhermitian interaction terms can be hermitian with
respect to a modied scalar product, or be made hermitian via a rearrangement
of the equation. in the three-body problem these rearrangements could be more

3

complicated. the hermiticity and the independence on the total energy are
linked features, as one of these is often achieved at the expense of the other one.
energy depending interaction terms destroy some of the advantages of the use
of an hermitian hamiltonian, such as the mutual orthogonality of the solutions,
and leads to modify the usual scalar products and perturbation calculation
methods. the 3d potentials deduced from eld theory are generally energy
dependent, at least in the higher-order terms. we shall require hermiticity and
energy-independence (or slow energy dependence) below the inelastic threshold
in the lowest order terms at least.

in our preceding works on the 2 1

2body problem [23], and. more recently,
on the three-fermion problem [26], our approach was based on the cluster sep-
arability requirement.
in the two fermions in an external potential problem,
the free green function was written in terms of the dirac free hamiltonians,
to which the external potential was added for each fermion (in the laboratory
reference frame). the 3d reduction was then performed exactly as in the pure
two-fermion case. in the three-fermion problem the 3d potential was obtained
by adding the three 3d potentials obtained by the 3d reduction of the three
two-fermion equations in the three-fermion rest frame. each two-fermion poten-
tial depending in general of the total energy of the subsystem, this two-fermion
energy was taken as the three-fermion total energy, minus the free dirac hamil-
tonian of the spectator fermion. the continuum dissolution was avoided by
choosing a two-fermion reduction based on a 3d propagator containing a pro-
jector on the positive eigenvalues eigenstates of the diracs free hamiltonian
(modied in the 2 1
2body problem by including the external potential). with
these choices the three two-cluster limits are exact: switching o the external
potential or switching o the two interaction terms with a spectator fermion
gives the exact 3d equation which would be obtained by the reduction of the
two-body bethe-salpeter equation (and switching o the mutual interaction in
the 2 1
2body problem gives two independent equations describing each a sin-
gle fermion in a potential). from this exact 3d equation for two fermions it
is possible to go back to the original two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation and
to perform the 3d reduction again in another reference frame, so that we can
consider this two-fermion equation as implicitly covariant. this covariance be-
comes an approximated covariance when the series giving the 3d potential is
truncated, for example by keeping only the born term.

although our 3d equations have exact two-cluster limits, they are themselves
approximations. in the 2 1
2body problem, one should take into account the
modications brought by the external potential to the fermion propagators also
inside the bethe-salpeter irreducible kernel.
in the three-body problem one
has to take into account the irreducible three-body terms at the bethe-salpeter
equation level and also the three-body terms generated at the 3d level by the
reduction. we tried to do that recently [27].

in the present work we try to get explicitly covariant two-fermion cluster
in this way, each

limits by using sazdjians explicitly covariant propagator.

4

term of the series giving the 3d potential is explicitly covariant and an approx-
imation of this potential (such as borns approximation) is possible without
breaking the covariance. there is a problem with the fact that sazdjians equa-
tion in its original form has an interaction term which is not hermitian. we
have to transform sazdjians two-fermion equation into an equivalent equation
with an hermitian interaction term before combining the three two-fermion in-
teraction terms into a three-fermion 3d equation. another problem comes from
the projection operator on the positive eigenvalues eigenstates of the free dirac
hamiltonians (introduced in order to avoid continuum dissolution beyond the
two-fermion problem): this projector is not covariant so that it is necessary to
search for a covariant substitute of it.

in section 2 we introduce the notations and a standard reduction method of
the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation.
in section 3 we present sazdjians
covariant propagator, transform sazdjians equation into an equivalent equa-
tion with an hermitian interaction term, and build a covariant substitute of
the positive-energy projector. a subsection is devoted to the one-body limit of
the resulting two-fermion equation. this explicitly covariant two-fermion equa-
tion is exploited in sections 4 ( 2 1
2body problem) and 5 (three-body problem).
section 6 is devoted to conclusions.

2 two fermions.

2.1 notations.

we shall write the bethe-salpeter equation for the bound states of two fermions
[1] as

 = g0k,

(1)

where  is the bethe-salpeter amplitude, function of the positions x1, x2 or
of the momenta p1, p2 of the fermions, according to the representation chosen.
the operator k is the bethe-salpeter kernel, given in a non-local momentum
representation by the sum of the irreducible two-fermion feynman graphs. the
operator g0 is the free propagator, given by the product g0
2 of the two
individual fermion propagators

where the hi are the dirac free hamiltonians

(i = 1, 2).

we shall dene the total (or external, cm, global) and relative (or internal)
variables:

x =

(x1 + x2) ,

p = p1 + p2 ,

x = x1  x2 ,

and give a name to the corresponding combinations of the free hamiltonians:

s = h1 + h2 ,

s =

1
2

(h1  h2).

(6)

we know that, at the no-interaction limit, we shall have to get a pair of free
dirac equations:

(p10  h1) = 0,

(p20  h2) = 0,

where  depends on x1, x2. let us also write their iterated versions

(p2

(p2

(p0  s) = 0,

2.2 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equa-

tion.

in the zero-order approximation, the free propagator g0 will be replaced by a
carefully chosen propagator g, combining a constraint like (p0 ) xing
the relative energy, and a global 3d propagator like 2i(p0s)112. the
argument of the  and the inverse of the 3d propagator should be combinations
of the operators used in the free equations (at last approximately and for the
positive-energy solutions). there exists an innity of possible combinations [3-
18]. the best choice depends on the quantities one wants to compute (energy
of the lowest state, hyperne splitting, recoil of a nucleus, etc...) and on the
properties one wants to preserve exactly in the rst approximation (cluster sepa-
rability, lorentz invariance, heavy mass limits, charge conjugation symmetry...).
all choices would be equivalent if all correction terms could be computed, but
this is of course impossible.

6

we shall see below that the reduced wave function  (from which the relative

time-energy degree of freedom can be trivially eliminated) is given by

 = g(g0)1.

(14)

the rst choice to be made in the 4d  3d reduction is that of the constraint
which xes the 3d hypersurface (p0 =  for example) on which we want to work.
the remaining of g is a purely 3d operator, the dierent choices of which
result in dierent 3d operators applied on a common basic 3d wave function
and in dierent rearrangements of a common reduction series giving the 3d
potential. the various propagator-based 3d reductions of the literature can
thus be classied according to the constraint they use. once this constraint
chosen, we can only write dierent equivalent forms (or sometimes projections)
of the same 3d equation. it is the unavoidable truncation of the reduction series
which makes the dierence (numeric, if we simply want to compute predictions of
eld theory; more fundamental, if we want to write constraint theory equations
with qcd inspired potentials).

two natural choices for the constraint are (p0s), based on the rst-order
equations (10) and (p0), based on the second-order equations (11). in (p0
s), s is an operator which can be diagonalized in momentum space using the
four projectors on the subspaces corresponding to the dierent signs of h1, h2
(see below). by contrast,  is a momentum-depending number, which reduces
2)/2p0 in the two-fermion center of mass frame ~p = 0, conserved in
to (m2
a pure two-fermion problem (but not in the two-fermion plus potential problem
or in the three-fermion problem). other constraints could also be chosen, such
as that of gross [6], which puts one particle (normally the heaviest) on mass
shell. we made a nonexhaustive review in ref.[17].
if we consider the contributions of the poles of

(15)

in an expression like kg0k, we must perform an integration with respect to
p0. if k is instantaneous, we get

g0  gs = z dp0g0(p0) =  gb,
gb = 2i g0 12,

g0 =

(16)

(17)

(18)

when k is not instantaneous, we must add the contributions of its singularities.
furthermore, in the residues of the poles of g0 we must take k at p10 = h1 or
at p20 = h2, according to the chosen integration path and to the sign of . in
order to work with a single g, we shall share the omassshellness equally
between the two fermions. in [26], we xed p0 to s, which means (p10h1) =
(p20h2). here, we shall x p0 to , which means (p2

10h2

1) = (p2

20h2

2) :

g(p0) = (p0) gs.

(19)

the operator  has a clear meaning in the basis built with the free solutions: it
is +1 for h1, h2 > 0, -1 for h1, h2 < 0 and zero when they have opposite signs.
it comes from the dependence of the p0 integral on the signs of the hi.

there exists an innity of possible choices for the propagator g. they must
however be (at least approximately) identical on the positive energy mass shell
p0 = e1 + e2. an obvious simplication can be made by replacing  by 1 (its
value for the physical free solutions) or by (p0) (to get the correct value for the
corresponding antiparticle states too). the merits of the  or no- choice are the
matter of an old debate. the operator  brings apparently useless complications
in the pure two-body case. in the two-body plus potential problem, however,
the generalization of this operator prevents the continuum dissolution disease
(see below). we shall refer to gs as salpeters 3d propagator [3] and to gb
as breits 3d propagator [28]. we could also keep only the ++ part of  :

g++ = ++ gb.

(20)

in the remaining of this subsection we shall work with a slightly more general
zero-order propagator

g = (p0) a gb

(21)

where a is an operator which commutes with g0, such as  (salpeter), 1
(breit) or ++.

we shall write the free propagator as the sum of the zero-order propagator,

plus a remainder:

g0 = g + gr.

the bethe-salpeter equation becomes then the inhomogeneous equation

 = g0k = (g + gr)k =  + grk,

with

 = gk

(= g(g0)1).

(22)

(23)

(24)

solving (formally) the inhomogeneous equation (23) with respect to  and
putting the result into (24), we get

 = gk(1  grk)1 = gk t 

(25)

8

where

obeys

k t = k(1  grk)1 = k + kgrk + ... = (1  kgr)1k

k t = k + kgrk t = k + k t grk.

(26)

(27)

the reduction series (26) re-introduces in fact the reducible graphs into the
bethe-salpeter kernel, but with g0 replaced by gr. equation (25) is a 3d
equivalent of the bethe-salpeter equation. it depends on the choice of g.

the relative energy dependence of eq. (25) can be easily eliminated:

and  obeys:

 =

v 

(28)

(29)

 = (p0) 

a

p0  s + ip0

where v is proportional to k t with the initial and nal relative energies xed
to  :

in less compact but more precise notations:

v = 2i 12k t (, ).

12k t (, )  z dp

0dp0(p

0)12k t (p

0, p0)(p0).

(30)

(31)

note that we write (p
0, p0) but (, ), as we keep  in operator form. this
operator is diagonal in the spatial momentum space. the eigenvalue will depend
on the position of  in the formula: the eigenvalue of the rst  in (31) will
be built with the nal momenta and that of the last  will be built with the
initial momenta.

the inversion of the reduction is given by

 = ( 1grk )1  = ( 1+grk t )  = ( 1+g0k t g k t )  = g0k t 
(32)
or, explicitating the relative energy variable

(p

0) = g0(p

0) k t (p

0, ) .

(33)

the splitting of g0 into two terms containing a  is the origin of unphysical
singularities in the terms of k t when the argument of the delta vanishes on
the singularities of k. when the full k t is computed, the singularities of the
dierent terms cancel mutually. when k t is truncated, some of the unphysical
singularities have to be removed by hand [6, 24].

the propagator g and thus gr, k t and v depend on the choice of a.
we shall therefore add a superscript , b, ++ when needed, for a = , 1, ++
respectively.

9

when a = 1 the operator av = v is hermitian for a xed p below the
inelastic threshold, with the usual scalar product. when a = ++ the operator
++v ++ is hermitian in the ++ = 1 subspace, and we can write

 =

1

p0  e1  e2 + i

++ v ++ ++.

(34)

when a =  the operator  v  is hermitian in the  2 = 1 subspace with the
scalar product

and we can write

(i, j) = z d3p +

i (~p )  (~p ) j(~p )

 =

1

p0  s + ip0

 v   2.

the 3d equations corresponding to a given constraint are related with each
other and with the o mass shell transition matrix element at the 3d level.
starting from breits equation, we have

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

 = a b,

and, conversely

b = a1 ,

if a1 exists. if not, we can use

v = v b(cid:2)1  (1  a) g0v b(cid:3)
v b = v (cid:2)1  (a  1) g0v(cid:3)

1

1

b = g0 v 

(40)

1

.

(41)

the 3d o mass shell transition matrix element t 3d = 2i12t (, ) can
be obtained by putting a = 0 in (37):

and its ++ projection is

t 3d = v b(cid:2) 1  g0v b(cid:3)

1

++ t 3d ++ = ++ v ++ ++ (cid:2) 1  g0 ++ v ++ ++(cid:3)

until now we did not specify a reference frame, and our equations are not

manifestly covariant under the lorentz group. however:

 trough not manifestly covariant, equations like (25) can always be trans-
formed back into the original bethe-salpeter equation, provided the reduction
series (26) is not truncated. the inclusion of higher-order terms will thus, in
principle, improve an approached covariance.

 even truncated, our equations could be made formally invariant by intro-
ducing a unit vector n = (1,~0) (we can call this vector the laboratory time
unit) and by making all elements in our equations invariant by using scalar

10

products with n. if we want more than a formal invariance, this unit vector can
however not be external to the system: one must therefore dene n as p/p 2
(the time unit of the center of mass reference frame), assuming p 2 > 0. an
equation like (34) can thus be assumed to have been written in the center of
mass reference frame and made explicitly covariant by using the p/p 2 vec-
tor. this covariant form could be used to write the system of equations in other
reference frames. there is no reason to do that in the pure two-body case, but
it will become necessary when other objects (as an external potential or a third
particle) are present. the (p0  ) gb combination written in the center of
mass reference frame looses its simplicity in its covariant form.

3 towards covariant truncations.

3.1 sadjians explicitly covariant equation.

it would be interesting to be able to simplify the equations in a covariance-
preserving way. with sazdjians explicitly covariant two-fermion propagator we
shall present now it will become possible to truncate the reduction series in a
covariant way (one might for example keep only the rst term of the reduction
series at the ladder approximation, i.e. the born term). writing g0 in the form

g0 =

1

(p2

10  e 2

1 + i)(p2

20  e 2

2 + i)

(p10 + h1)(p20 + h2)12,

(42)

forgetting for a while the matricial product (p10 + h1)(p20 + h2)12 which is
specic to the rst-order equation and integrating the remainder with respect
to p0, we get a second-order equivalent of salpeters propagator:

gs2 = 4i
p0h 0

where

 =

1
2

(1 + 2),

1 =

p0 + 2

2e1

,

2 =

p0  2

2e2

.

(43)

(44)

is the second-order equivalent of  : for a given p0, the operator i
is the o
mass shell extrapolation of the sign of the energy of the fermion i. the presence
of  annihilates thus the residues of the poles at p0 = (e1e2), so that gs2
can be written

gs2 = 2i

e1 + e2
2e1e2

1

p 2
0  (e1 + e2)2 + i

.

(45)

it is important to note the dierence of action between  and  : the p0independent
operator  kills the subspaces of the (+ ) and ( +) solutions (  2 is a pro-
jector), while the p0dependent operator  simply annihilates the residues of

11

the corresponding poles in the free propagator. if we replace  by (p0) we
get sazdjians second-order 3d propagator [12] :

gsz2 = 4i
|p0| h 0 .

(46)

the product of the second-order constraint (p0 ) with sazdjians second-
order 3d propagator (sazdjians second-order propagator) is invariant. if we
now re-introduce the (p10 + h1)(p20 + h2)12 factor, we get

(p0) gsz = 2i

(p1  1 + m1) (p2  2 + m2)

and sazdjians rst-order 3d propagator [12] is thus

gsz = i

the equations built with salpeters or breits or with the positive-energy prop-
agator were not explicitly covariant. they were however implicitly covariant, as
it was always possible to go back to the original covariant bethe-salpeter equa-
tion and to perform the same 3d reduction again in another reference frame.
however, this is possible only if the series giving k t is not truncated. with a
0  ~p 2 will not be indepen-
truncated k t the squared mass spectrum p 2 = p 2
dent of the spatial momentum ~p . in contrast, with a 3d equation like (51),
based on a covariant propagator, it becomes possible to change the reference
frame without going back to the original bethe-salpeter equation. even with a
truncated v sz, the squared mass spectrum will be independent of the spatial
momentum ~p and will be more easily computable by choosing the center of
mass reference frame.

3.2 restoring hermiticity.

in sazdjians 3d equation (51) the interaction term is not hermitian. we can
transform this equation into an equation with an hermitian interaction by writ-
ing it in pseudo-breit form with the denitions

b =

2 p0

v b = (p0)v sz(cid:20)1  (

(54)

=

(p0)v sz(cid:21)1
2 |p0| + v sz b

2 p0v sz

where we rst moved an (p0) from asz to v sz in (51), whence the super-
script b and the name pseudo-breit. equation (54) can also be obtained
more directly [29] by writing equation (51) in the form

p0 (cid:18)1 

and dening

v sz

2 |p0|(cid:19) sz

v sz

2 |p0|(cid:19) sz = s (cid:18)1 +
b = (cid:18)1 +
2 |p0|(cid:19) sz .

v sz

(55)

(56)

while a truncation of the series giving directly v b or v b would spoil the co-
variance of the equation, a truncation of the series giving v sz would preserve
this covariance. we could thus, for example, replace v sz by its born approx-
imation. a possible problem could arise from the zeros of the denominator of
(53).

another way of getting an hermitian interaction from (51) is provided by

the transformation

which leads to

3.3 covariant positive-energy projectors.

the combination of two fermions with opposite energy signs leads to continuum
dissolution when an external potential or a third particle is added. this is
the case with breits and sazdjians equations, while in other equations this
diculty is avoided owing to operators like , ++ or , which kill the unwanted
singularities. unfortunately, these operators are not covariant. they could not
be introduced into sazdjians potential v sz without spoiling the invariance of
the truncations.

a lorentz invariant operator forcing a positive energy for fermion i could be

i = (pi0)(p2

i ) = (pi0  |~pi|)

(59)

as the sign of the energy is invariant for positive squared masses. taking the
product of two such operators (one for each fermion) and replacing p0 by 
gives

( p0 | ~p1| + q2)( p0 | ~p1| q2)/2p0, which implies that p0 must be outside
the interval (| ~p1| q2,| ~p1|+ q2). the combination of these two results implies
p0 >| ~p1|+q2. the second  brings no supplementary restriction, its argument
being always positive when p0 >| ~p1|+q2. we can thus write

is

we see that our projection operator introduces a cuto on the high | ~pi| for a

fermion can be omitted. for a given bound state energy p0,  eliminates the
mixed-energy signs continuum which would share this energy. when p0 = s,
(65) reduces indeed to (h1)(h2). in g. 1, we draw a map of the  = 1 region
in the (h1, h2) plane, for p0 xed to 2 (in arbitrary units) and dierent values
of the lowest mass m1 : 0, 0.5, 1 (solid line), 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3. we draw only
the rst quadrant, the other ones being the mirror images of the rst one. the
 = 1 region is bounded by the two pi0 = 0 curves, and by the p2
1 = 0
curve corresponding to the lowest mass m1. in each quadrant, this region is
divided into four parts, corresponding to the signs of h2
2 (as
an exemple, we indicate this partition in the m1 = 1, m2 = 1.1 case, for which
p0 is thus 0.1 below the threshold 2.1). both expressions are positive denite
for the pure two (and three) fermion systems, the negative values being for the
bound states of the fermions in an external potential.

while the ++ = 1 region is simply the rst quadrant, the  = 1 region is
divided into four symmetric parts, one for each quadrant, but there is a cuto on
the high-hi values. for moderately relativistic systems, the important regions
are near the (m1, m2) point.

we shall thus nally choose the 3d propagator

g =  gsz

(67)

and replace v sz by  v   in the various forms of sazdjians equation.

in

b =

p0  s + ip0

2 |p0| +  v

(68)

3.4 one-body limit.

if we go to the center of mass reference frame, write p0 = m2 +w1 (for p0 > 0 )
and make m2   in (68), we get the equation

b =

1

w1  h1 + i

(w1  | ~p1|) v  (w1  | ~p1|) b

(69)

as the limit of  is (w1  | ~p1|). equation (69) is related to the equation

 =

1

w1  h1 + i

v 

15

(70)

which describes the light fermion 1 in the potential generated by the heavy
fermion 2. we have

v  = v (cid:18)1 

(| ~p1|  w1)

w1  h1

v(cid:19)1

 = (w1  | ~p1|) .

(71)

(72)

equation (69) is thus the exact equation for the projection (72) provided the ex-
pansion of (71) is not truncated. if, however, the two-body potential is truncated
to the born term, its one-body limit will be v instead of v . the introduction
of the projector  has destroyed the exact one-body limit of the born approxi-
mation, as it would also be the case with the more usual continuum dissolution
preserving operators  or ++.

4 two fermions in an external potential.

the two-fermion in an external potential problem is already much more compli-
cated than the pure two-fermion problem, although it exhibits some simplifying
features when compared with the three-fermion problem. the principal new
diculty is the non-conservation of the total spatial momentum ~p . in the pure
two-fermion case, this conservation law forbids the mixing of the physical bound
states with the mixed-energy states (continuum dissolution). when an external
potential is present, it becomes possible to get any given energy in an innity of
ways by combining fermions with opposite free energy signs. the positive-energy
bound states will then not be normalizable, being mixed with a continuum.

the two-fermion plus potential equations can easily be obtained with the

simple generalizations [23]

hi = ~i .~pi + i mi + vi(~xi, i)

(73)

where vi
is the external potential acting on fermion i (beyond the ladder ap-
proximation we should also modify the fermion propagators inside the crossed
graphs). the continuum dissolution appears in the reduction using breits prop-
agator: we get singularities in the higher-order terms of the 3d perturbation
calculation and of the reduction series. the continuum dissolution is avoided
with the reductions using , ++,  or  operators (which must also be built
with the generalized hi ). our projector  is still given by (65) in terms of the
generalized hi. besides the free-free continuum, the (h1, h2) spectrum contains
now bound-free or free-bound combinations (lines) and bound-bound combina-
tions (points). the equations are written in the laboratory reference frame,
dened as the reference frame in which the external potential is static. when
the mutual interaction is switched o, we get a pair of independent dirac equa-
tions in the external potential. when the external potential is switched o, we

16

get the equation of a system of mutually interacting fermions. this equation
must no more refer to the laboratory reference frame, i.e. it must be invariant.
we have already studied the two-fermion in an external potential problem
some years ago [23]. after the switching o of the external potential, the re-
sulting equation was implicitly covariant provided the reduction series is not
truncated: the 3d reduction being based on a non-covariant zero-order propa-
gator, the truncations on the 3d potential led to non-covariant 3d equations.
in the present work, with the combination of the covariant propagator of sazd-
jian and our covariant  projector, the truncations of the reduction series are
also covariant. we could thus keep only the born term of v  in the various
forms of the positive-energy sazdjian equation. with the non-hermitian form,
for exemple, we have

p0  = (cid:20) h1 + h2 +

p0 + h1 + h2

2 | p0 |

 v  (cid:21) .

(74)

if we start with a bound eigenstate of both hi and consider the mutual inter-
action as a perturbation, we can, at rst order, replace p0 by h1 +h2 before
and after v . the rst-order energy shift will be

 p0 = < v  > .

(75)

with the hermitian form we get the same result if we neglect  v   before
2|p0| in the denominator of (68). if we start with (58), we have
2 |p0| ! .

p0  =   h1 + h2 +s p0 + s
2 |p0|

 v  s p0 + s

(76)

in a perturbation calculation, the arguments of the rst and last square roots
of the terms of the perturbation series will be positive. if we go beyond the rst
order, the internal square roots will always appear in pairs.

5 three fermions.

5.1 in search of a cluster separable 3d equation...

a three-fermion 3d equation, inspired by the two-fermion equation (29) with
a = 1 could be

(p0  s)  = [ v12(p0h3) + v23(p0h1) + v31(p0h2) ] 

(77)

with s = h1 + h2 + h3. the potentials are the two-body potentials dened by
(30). each two-body potential vij was a function of the partial energy pij0,
which we xed to its (ij)+k cluster-separated limit p0 hk (in the following,

17

we shall omit the (p0  hk) arguments when not explicitly needed). at the
v23 = v31 = 0 limit, for example, we get

writing

(cid:20) p0  h1  h2  h3(cid:21)  = v12(p0h3) .

 = 12 3,

p0 = p120 + p30

(78)

(79)

we get two independent equations:

(cid:20) p120  h1  h2(cid:21) 12 = v12(p120) 12,

p30 3 = h3 3

(80)

as p0h3 can be replaced by p0p30 = p120. our 3d equation (77) satises
thus clearly the cluster separability requirement. furthermore, the three cluster-
separated limits are exactly the 3d equations we would get by 3d-reducing the
corresponding two-fermion bethe-salpeter equations. this cluster separability
is a property of the equation, or, if we prefer, of the full green function. for a
given scattering solution it is also possible to take the cluster-separated limit at
xed p. this is not possible for the bound state solutions.

in the two-body problem all quantities can be dened in the center of mass
reference frame.
in the two-body plus potential problem we had to start in
the laboratory frame but to consider also the center of mass reference frame at
the no-external potential limit. in the three-body problem we must start in the
three-body center of mass frame and consider the center of mass reference frames
of the three possible two-body subsystems obtained by cluster separation. the
fact that the three cluster-separated limits are exact insures in principle the
lorentz invariance / cluster separability requirement: at the cluster separated
limits the two-body equation can indeed be transformed back into a covariant
two-body bethe-salpeter equation. there is no necessity of introducing lorentz
boosts by hand.

equation (77) can however not be used, as it suers of continuum dissolution.
in [26], we made a careful examination of this problem. we found no mixing of
the physical bound states with the two-cluster continua (a bound state of two
fermions with a third fermion of opposite free energy sign), owing to the total
spatial monentum conservation as in the pure two-fermion case. however, we
found that the physical bound states (+ + +) can mix with the (+ + ), (+  +)
and ( + +) states of the three-cluster continuum. the mixing can be avoided
by writing a three-fermion 3d equation, inspired by the two-fermion equation
(29) with a = ++, such as

(p0  e1  e2  e3)  = +++ ( v ++

12 + v ++

23 + v ++

) +++ .

5.2 ...with covariant truncations.

our two-body potentials are the sum of an innity of contributions symbolized
by feynman graphs. keeping only the rst one (born approximation) or a nite
number of them would break the lorentz covariance of the two-fermion clusters.
a born approximation preserving the lorentz invariance / cluster separability
property can be obtained by using the 3d reduction based on sazdjians covari-
ant propagator combined with the covariant substitute  of ++ to prevent
continuum dissolution. the result is

(p0  s)  = ( u12 + u23 + u31 ) 
12(cid:21)p120=p0h3
12 #p120=p0h3

if we start with the two-fermion positive-energy sazdjian equation in breits
hermitian form. note that the resulting equations (82) obtained with the choices
(83) or (84) are not equivalent, although they have equivalent two-cluster limits.
switching o the interactions between the third fermion and the cluster (12)
will give a free dirac equation for the third fermion, and one of the forms of the
positive-energy sazdjian equation written in the (123) center of mass reference
frame for the (12) cluster. this last equation being covariant can be considered
to be written in the (12) center of mass reference frame or in any other frame.
this covariance is preserved even if we use a (lorentz invariant) approximation
of v 
12. we did not consider the form (58) of sazdjians equation, as here the
arguments of the square roots could become negative.

6 conclusions.

using the explicitly covariant sazdjian propagator combined with our covari-
ant substitute of the positive-energy projector, we built a 3d equation for two
fermions in an external potential and for three fermions. the two-fermion equa-
tions obtained at the cluster separated limits are these which would be obtained
by a 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation. in our preced-
ing works this implied that they were implicitly covariant if not truncated, even
if they were written in a specic reference frame (the laboratory frame or the
three-fermion rest frame). in the present work, however, they are explicitly co-
variant, which implies that the covariance will survive the possible truncations
of the 3d potentials. the invariant substitute of the positive energy projector
we use brings a cuto on the spatial momenta, which could be welcome when

19

it is not by itself an approximation:

insuring the existence of some integrals. this cuto appear for rather low, but
nevertheless truly relativistic values.
it
reects the choice to work with a given projection of the two-fermion equation.
the 3d equations we write in this work are more complicated that the
corresponding equations in our preceding works. keeping in mind that in both
cases the 3d potentials are given by series to be truncated anyway, we hope
that the lorentz invariance / cluster separability properties of the truncations
of the present equations will result in a better approach of the real physics in
the rst terms.
