introduction

1.

in type iib string theory, there are many types of 7-branes labeled by two integers p and

q, which specify the sl(2, z) monodromies around them. if we go around a [p, q] 7-brane in
the counter-clockwise direction, we obtain a sl(2, z) monodromy m[p,q] dened by

(1.1)

m[p,q] =

1  pq
q2

p2

1 + pq  ,

and to avoid multiple values of elds and string charges, we should introduce branch cuts

which give sl(2, z) transformations compensating for the monodromies. it was suggested
by zwiebach et al. 1) - 6) that when 7-branes of a specic combination are on top of each
other, various groups containing exceptional groups, ane groups, and other exotic groups
appear as gauge groups on the 7-branes. to construct an, dn and en gauge theories, we
need three types of 7-branes with labels [1, 0], [1, 1] and [1, 1]. following 1), 2), we call
them a-, b- and c-branes, respectively. the degrees of freedom contributing to the gauge
symmetry enhancement arise from string junctions connecting some of these 7-branes. the

(p, q) charges of strings attached on a 7-brane should be equal to the label of the 7-branes.
it is known that type iib theory compactied on s2, which can also be expressed as a k3
compactication of f-theory, is dual to heterotic string theory compactied on t 2. on s2
we have 24 7-branes corresponding to singular bers of elliptically bered k3. as is pointed
out in 5), the junction lattice of the type iib theory on s2 has the signature (+18, 2), which
is the same as the signature for the narain lattice of heterotic string theory. because there

is unique 18 + 2-dimensional lorentzian self-dual even lattice, it is trivial to show that the
junction lattice is identical to the narain lattice on heterotic side. the purpose of the present
paper is, by means of dualities, to establish the one to one correspondence between invariant

charges of junctions in type iib theory and the quantum numbers specifying perturbative
states of a heterotic string.

these two theories are dual in the manner we now describe. on s2, we have 24 7-
branes. although there are many representations of these 7-branes, we restrict ourselves
to the case that they are represented as four sets of a4bc. once we obtain some results
for this background, we can extend them to other regions of moduli space by a continuous
deformation of the background.
in the weak coupling limit (gstr  0), a pair consisting
of a b-brane and a c-brane is reduced to an orientifold 7-plane. 7) therefore, in this limit,
we have four orientifold 7-planes, and the compactication manifold s2 becomes a t 2/z2
orientifold. by means of a t duality transformation along two directions on t 2/z2, the
theory is transformed into type i theory on t 2, and it is s dual to the so(32) heterotic
string theory on t 2.

2

through this series of duality transformations, we can relate bps states in heterotic
string theory to those in type iib theory. let us assume the two compactied directions
to be x8 and x9, and call momenta and winding numbers along them m8, m9, n8 and n9.
(generically, momenta m8 and m9 are not integers, due to the presence of wilson lines, while
winding numbers n8 and n9 are always integers.) in table i, it is displayed how the states
carrying these charges are transformed by the dualities. as is known from this table, charges

(p, q) ( = 8, 9) of strings winding along the x8 and x9 directions in type iib theory are
represented by quantum numbers of heterotic string as follows:

(1.2)

the factor 1/2 on the right-hand side of the second and the fourth equation in (1.2) is a
consequence of the fact that the t dual of a winding type i d-string is half of a type iia
d-particle on an orientifold 8-plane.

we should note that in generic 7-brane backgrounds, there is a certain subtlety concerning
the denition of winding numbers of strings on the type iib side. we explain this in section

3 before giving the nal result.

2. spectrum of a heterotic string

if we assume the left mover (without tilde) is supersymmetric and the right mover (with
tilde) is bosonic, the mass formula and the level matching condition for t d compactied
heterotic string theory are given by

m 2
8tstr

(2.1)

where  = 10  d, . . . , 9 labels the compactied directions, and the constant a is 1/2 for
the ns sector and 0 for the r sector. the variables a
0 represent the zero mode of
the compactied coordinates x , and the vector ea0 is the zero-mode associated with the 16-

dimensional internal space of the right mover. due to the quantization of the momenta and

wrapping numbers, the 2d + 16-dimensional vector (a

t d is rectangular. then, the zero modes are quantized as

where r are compactication radii, k is a vector on a 16-dimensional self-dual even lattice
 , and w are wilson lines which take values on the torus r16/ . from this equation, we
can read modied momenta m, which are momenta containing the shift due to the wilson
line, as

m = m + w  k 

w  wn,

(2.3)

where m and n are integers. now, we are considering so(32) heterotic string theory, and
 should be the so(32) weight lattice, which is generated by the basis

i = ei  ei+1(i = 1, . . . , 15), 16 = e15 + e16, s =

1
2

16xi=1

ei,

(2.4)

where the ei form an orthonormal basis of r16. for the following argument, it is convenient
to dene the 2d + 16-dimensional vector

k = (k, m10d, n10d, . . . , m8, n8, m9, n9).

furthermore, we introduce vectors w that satisfy

where the inner product is dened by using the metric

for example, in the s1 compactied case, the vector w9 is given by

(2.8)

the vectors w also satisfy the equation

w  w =  .

(2.9)

therefore, they form an orthonormal basis of the d-dimensional sub-manifold with a negative
denite metric. the moduli parameters of the heterotic string theory are specied by giving

this sub-manifold and the string coupling constant, and this implies that the moduli space
of the heterotic string compactied on t d is

so(16 + d, d)

so(16 + d)  so(d)  so(16 + d, d; z)  r+,

where r+ is associated with the string coupling constant gstr.

the bps condition for a heterotic string is

nosc + a = 0.

for bps states, the norm of k should be smaller than 2:

k2 = (ea0)2 + (ea

0 )2  (a

0 )2 = 2(fnosc +ea)  2.

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

equation (2.12) corresponds to the bps condition for junctions (j  j)  2 given in 8), 9).
(in this paper, we adopt a signature for the intersection number that is opposite to that in
refs. 2), 4).) the mass formula can be rewritten as

in particular, massless states should satisfy

m 2
4tstr

= (w  k)2.

w  k = 0.

(2.13)

(2.14)

equation (2.14) denes a subspace of codimension d. because all of the w have negative
norms and the whole space has signature (+d+16, d), this subspace has a positive denite
metric. because the lattice on the subspace corresponds to massless gauge elds, the sub-
lattice is nothing but a root lattice of the gauge group. let us introduce the basis ui on the
sub-lattice corresponding to the fundamental weight. then, any vector k can be expanded
as

k = aiui + cw.

(2.15)

the coecients ai give the dynkin label of the state associated with the vector k. on the
other hand, the coecients c give central charges of the state, because the mass square of
each state is given as the sum of the square of the c:

m 2
4tstr

=x

c2
.

(2.16)

when we compactify heterotic string theory on a torus t d, new 2d u(1) elds appear
from the metric and the ns-ns 2-form eld, and at a generic point in moduli space, the
gauge group is a subgroup of so(32)u(1)2d. for example, if we compactify the x8 direction
and introduce the wilson line

w8 =(cid:18)(cid:18)1
2(cid:19)n

, 016n(cid:19) ,

(n < 8)

(2.17)

then gauge symmetry is broken to so(2n)  so(32  2n)  u(1)2. if we adjust the com-
pactication radius to the value specied by

1
2

w2

8 +

r2
8
l2
s

= 1,

(2.18)

then some winding modes become massless, and the gauge symmetry so(2n)  u(1) is
enhanced to en+1. we can conrm this by observing the sub-lattice given by (2.14).

3. correspondence of states

in ref. 3), it is shown that the junction lattice associated with the 7-brane background

anbcbc (n < 8) is identical to the root lattice of the ane lie algebra ben+1. on the het-

erotic side, this background corresponds to t 2 compactication with the wilson line (2.17)
and the compactication radius r8 satisfying (2.18). in the 7-brane background, in addi-
tion to junctions i associated with the nite lie algebra en+1, we have three independent
junctions, , 0, and  (fig.1). an arbitrary junction on the background is expanded as
follows:

j = aii + k0 +en + .

(3.1)

coecients k and en correspond to the level and the grade, while  is nothing but the

asymptotic ns-ns charge. the intersection numbers among these junctions are given in
table ii. here aij is the inverse matrix of the cartan matrix of the nite lie algebra en+1.

the components expressed as  in the table depend on the convention used in dening the

6

m 2
4tstr

= (xk + yen)2 + z22,

(3.2)

junctions 0 and . by adding  to them, we can x these components to arbitrary values.
the correspondence of the vector ui in (2.15) and junctions i is trivial. here, we focus
on determining how we can reproduce the intersection (  ), which is independent of the
convention. because the three junctions 0,  and  carry central charges and  and 0
respect the same supersymmetry, the contribution of these three charges to the mass can be
expressed as

where x, y and z are some constants. if we assume the components  in table ii are zero,
by comparing this equation with eq.(2.16), we obtain the following correspondence between
vectors on narain lattice and junctions:

w8  z, w9  y0 + x.

(3.3)

the problem is to determine how we should x the coecients x, y and z. for z, we can

proceed as follows. as is shown in fig.1, the junction  contains a string loop with r-r
charge q9 = 1/(8 n). by the relation (1.2), we know that the conguration  on the type
iib side corresponds to a heterotic string with winding number n8 = 2/(8 n). on the other
hand, the n8 component of the vector w8 is ls/(2r8) = 2/8  n. therefore, we nd

 

1

8  n

w8.

(3.4)

if we believe this correspondence, we can reproduce the self-intersection number of  in

table ii as an inner product of the vector:

(  ) =

1

8  n

w8  w8 = 

1

8  n

.

(3.5)

in this way, can we establish a complete correspondence between the quantum numbers

of heterotic strings and invariant charges of junctions? probably, this is possible. however, it
is dicult. the origin of the diculty is the existence of congurations like . the position

of the d-string loop can be freely moved, and the length of the string attached to the loop
depends on the position. however, information regarding the position is not contained in

the quantum numbers on the heterotic string side. therefore it is not clear how we should
dene the winding number on the type iib side using heterotic quantum numbers.

there is only one case in which such subtlety does not exist. the reason we need the

string attached on the string loop of the junction  is that the monodromy around the loop
changes the charge of the string loop. therefore, in the at background, where the r-r

charge of each o7-plane is canceled by four d7-branes and the monodromy around the cycle

7

is 1, congurations like  are not allowed, and the denition of the winding number is very
clear. on the heterotic side, the background is specied by the following wilson line:

w8 = (08, (1/2)8), w9 = (04, (1/2)4, 04, (1/2)4).

(3.6)

on this background, there is no subtlety concerning the denition of charges, and by means
of eq.(1.2), we can represent the winding numbers of strings on the type iib side by quantum

conguration with two string loops with charges (p, q) (fig.2). if the components of the

numbers on the heterotic side. if all the components of the vector ea0 vanish, we obtain a
vector ea0 = k  n8w8  n9w9 take nonzero values, each component should be regarded as

the number of strings attached to each d7-brane. as a result, we obtain the conguration
in fig.3. in this case, the charges of the string loops are not constant on them, due to the

fundamental strings lying between the loops and d7-branes. nevertheless, we can dene the
charge (p, q) of the junction uniquely as one half of the sum of the charges that go through
cycles wrapped around the x8 and x9 directions, which are represented by the dashed lines
in fig.3. the charge of any segment in the conguration in fig.3 is determined by the
information we have already given. in fig.3, we assume that the branch cuts go outward.

by means of continuous deformation, we can collect all 16 d7-branes at the same position.
as we move d7-branes, the branch cuts attached on them are also moved. if the branch cuts

go across strings, the charges of the strings change, and if a d7-brane goes across strings
with d-string charge, the number of strings attached to the d7-brane is changed through the
hanany-witten eect. taking account of these facts, we obtain the conguration in fig.4.

in this conguration, we have separated each o7-plane into a b- and a c-brane, and the 24
7-branes we have obtained are labeled a1,   , a16, b1, c1,   , b4, c4 in counter-clockwise
order. as a result, invariant charges of the junctions are given as follows:

qai = ki,

qb1 = 0,

qc1 = 0,
qb2 = m8 + n8  n9  s,
qc2 = m8 + n8  s,
qb3 = m8 + m9  n8 + s,
qc3 = m8 + m9  n9 + s,
qb4 = m9 + n9  s,
qc4 = m9  n8 + n9  s,

where s is dened by

s =

ki.

(3.16)

because the vector k takes values on the lattice  , s is always an integer.

junctions, which are dual to heterotic string states, should be proper; i.e., their invariant
charges should be integers. at rst sight, however, eq.(3.7) gives fractional charges qai when
k contains an odd number of spinor roots s in (2.4). we can always make this junction
proper by adding null junctions. we have two independent null junctions n1 and n2, which
go around all 24 junctions. because the compactication manifold is s2, these junctions can
shrink to a point. they have the following invariant charges:

n1 : (016, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), n2 : (116, 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1).

(3.17)

if all qai of a junction are half odd integer, by adding the null junction (n1 + n2)/2, we can
make it a proper junction. furthermore, using null junctions, we can x any two of qbi and
qci to any values, and in the relations (3.7)-(3.15) we adopted the convention qb1 = qc1 = 0.
finally, let us conrm that the intersection number dened in ref. 2) is consistent with
the inner product of the vector k. according to ref. 2), the intersection numbers among
unit junctions are

(ai  aj) = (bi  bj) = (ci  cj) = ij,

(ai  bj) = 

1
2

,

(ai  cj) =

1
2

,

(3.18)

(3.19)

(bi  cj) =

1
1

(i  j)
(i > j).

(in our convention, intersection numbers have signs opposite to those in ref. 2).) using these
equations, we obtain

this is identical to the inner product k2 on the narain lattice.

(j  j) = k2 + 2m8n8 + 2m9n9.

(3.20)

4. conclusion

we have established the correspondence between the quantum numbers of heterotic
strings compactied on t 2 and invariant charges of junctions on s2 with 24 7-branes. in or-
der to nd the necessary relations, we used a at background on the type iib side. however,
once we have obtained the relations (3.7)-(3.15), they are available for non-at backgrounds,
because both the junction lattice and the narain lattice are discrete, and the relations be-

tween them are invariant under continuous deformations of moduli parameters. in fact, the

9

moduli space of elliptic k3 is

so(18, 2)

so(18)  so(2)  so(18, 2; z)  r+  r+,

(4.1)

where the two copies of r+ represent the kahler structure of the base manifold and that
of the elliptic ber, respectively. in the case of the compactication of f-theory, we should

ignore the kahler structure of the elliptic ber. hence, the moduli space of type iib theory
compactied on s2 is identical to that of t 2-compactied heterotic string theory, (2.10), and
it is expected that at any point on the moduli space we can use the formulae (3.7)-(3.15). for
example, applying these formulae to a vector w8 with the wilson line (2.17), we correctly
obtain the junction , although the background is not at.
