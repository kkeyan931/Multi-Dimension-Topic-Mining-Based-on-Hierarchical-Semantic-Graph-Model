1 introduction

the aim of this paper is to classify the structure of the solution set of embedded

nielsen-olesen vortices for general gauge theories. to do this requires the concepts of

embedded defects, rst formally introduced in [1]. in many ways this work improves

on and extends the initial treatment of vortex classication attempted in [2], and the

companion paper to that [3] contains many illustrative examples of the formalism

discussed herewithin.

this rst section is devoted to a quick review of gauge theories coupled to a

scalar eld sector. this will serve to set the scene and establish the notation for the

later sections of this paper where we shall classify vortex solutions. we emphasize

in particular how the symmetry breaking relates to the group structure of gauge

theory.

fermions will be excluded from the discussion, so we shall only have to consider

the eects of scalar-gauge interaction. this is appropriate because fermions seem

to merely modify the form of solution, introducing fermionic zero modes around

the background scalar-gauge conguration, whereas here we are interested in the

background conguration itself, which is determined by the global topographical

features of the gauge theory and its symmetry breaking.

1.1 yang-mills theories coupled to a scalar field

we are concerned with eld theories whose basic dynamical variables are gauge

potentials a and scalar elds . interaction of the scalar eld  with the gauge

potential a is specied by the gauge symmetry group g, a compact lie group

acting upon the scalar eld via the representation d of g. we consider theories

of the form described by the lagrangian (6) below. once the gauge group and its

action upon the scalar eld are specied the theory is completely determined up to

the strength of scalar eld self couplings and the gauge coupling constants.

the gauge potential a lies in the lie algebra of g, which we denote by g. the

eld tensor of the gauge potential is

f := a  a + [a, a]  g.

(1)

1

the local actions of the gauge group upon the scalar eld and gauge potential take

the form (for g(x)  g)

(x) 7 (x) = d(g(x))(x),

a(x) 7 a

(x) = g(x)a(x)g(x)1  (g(x))g(x)1.

the eld tensor transforms under a similarity transformation

f(x) 7 f 

(x) = g(x)f(x)g(x)1.

the covariant derivative of ,

d = ( + d(a)) ,

transforms according to

d(x) 7 (d)(x) = d(g(x))d(x).

(2a)

(2b)

(3)

(4)

(5)

here d(x) is the derived representation of d, describing how g acts on  by the

relation d(ex) = ed(x).

we need inner products on g and on the space v of  values, both of which

must be invariant under the actions of the group g: on v hd(g), d(g)i = h, i,

while on g, had(g)x, ad(g)xi = hx, xi, where ad(.) is the adjoint action of g on

g dened by gexg1 = ead(g)x. suitable forms and properties of these are dened

in appendix b.

assembling the above, the minimal gauge-invariant lagrangian describing the

gauge picture interaction of a scalar eld with a gauge potential is:

l[, a] = 

1
4

hf, f i +

1
2

hd, di  v [].

(6)

here v [] is the scalar potential, describing self interaction of the scalar eld, and

is constrained to be invariant under local (gauge) transformations.

the gauge coupling constants manifest themselves in an interesting way. the

lie algebra g has a natural decomposition into commuting subalgebras

g = g1      gn,

(7)

note that we are using the same symbol for inner products on g and v; we hope it should be

clear from the context which inner product we are considering.

sensible quantisation also requires the potential to be a fourth order (or less) polynomial.

2

with each gf either simple or one-dimensional. thus an ad(g) invariant inner

product on g has n scales, related to the norm on each gf . with respect to this inner

product the unit norm generators are written qf xf ; these qf s are interpreted as the

gauge coupling constants appertaining to gf , as explicitly illustrated in sec. (5.2).

furthermore, taking the limit qf  0 makes the symmetry gf global. for a unit

norm generator qf xf , one sees that the eect of taking qf  0 is to decouple the

gauge eld in eq. (4), rendering gf global.

1.2 symmetry breaking

the form of the scalar potential v may cause the fully symmetric theory to be

unstable.

the trivial background vacuum takes eld values (x) = 0 and a(x) = 0,

and a perturbative quantum eld theory around it has full gauge symmetry g.

however, this may not be the global energy minimum among all background eld

congurations. in such a situation the unstable background will decay to the stable

background vacuum, where (x) = 0 6= 0. such a background does not respect the

full symmetries of the original theory, but only a compact subgroup h. in this case,

the theory may admit solitonic scalar-gauge congurations that asymptotically tend

to the stable background. in this paper we are primarily interested in the spectrum

and classication of these congurations.

it is the form of the scalar potential v [] that determines whether, and how, the

gauge symmetry is spontaneously or dynamically broken. the stable background

vacuum is the one in which (x) = 0, a(x) = 0, where 0 is a global minimum of

the scalar potential. then the quantum eld theory with this vacuum is obtained

by perturbing around 0, and is described by the lagrangian

lh[, a] = lg[0 + , a],

which has residual gauge symmetry

h = {h  g : d(h)0 = 0}.

(8)

(9)

the quantum eld theory contains a spectrum of massive gauge bosons correspond-

ing to those symmetries that are broken; these gauge bosons have internal directions

3

in m, where

g = h  m,

(10)

the direct sum being dened by the inner product h, i.

because the theory has gauge symmetry g (about the trivial vacuum), the global

minimum of the scalar potential generally has degenerate values, forming a compact

manifold. this is the vacuum manifold,

m = d(g)0

= g/h;

(11)

it is the shape of this manifold that determines the non-perturbative, solitonic spec-

trum of the scalar-gauge theory. the coset space g/h is homogenous, and at the

identity element has tangent space m. the group h acts as rotations on points of

g/h around the identity element. this picture is echoed in the space d(g)0  v,

where the tangent space at 0 is d(m)0 and d(h) acts as rotations of points of

d(g)0 around 0. one thus interprets m as vectors that move 0, and h as

actions that rotate around 0.

the set of all symmetries of the vacuum manifold form the isometry group

i = {a  aut(v) : am = m},

(12)

which is generally larger than g. this has a corresponding induced representation
d of i, reducing to d of g, and a subgroup

j = {j  i : d(j)0 = 0},

containing h. the vacuum manifold may then be re-expressed

m =

g
h

=

i
j

.

(13)

(14)

in some cases these additional elements of i represent hidden global symmetries

of the theory; we discuss the su(2)  1 example in sec. (5.1).

in other cases,

however, the additional elements are not symmetries of the theory. an example is

the electroweak model, discussed in sec. (5.2), where i = su(2)  su(2) is not a

symmetry of the model unless sinw = 0. however m is isomorphic to the symmetric
space i/j = s3.

in what follows we shall assume that all hidden symmetries have been included

in the symmetry group g.

4

2 vortices

this is the pivotal section of the paper: here we describe how vortices are classied;

whereas the rest of the paper will be used to explain and establish these results.

the tactic is to consider the archetypal abelian-higgs vortex, and then to embed

it into a larger theory  one may then examine the associated gauge freedom by

moving it continuously around within the larger theory. this will naturally partition

the set of all vortex solutions into families of gauge equivalent vortices. we will nd

that this process is equivalent to a partitioning of the tangent space to the vacuum

manifold, m, in a very natural way; this equivalence being provided by a natural

association between vortices and vectors in m. thus by explicitly partitioning m

into its constituent parts a classication of vortices is achieved.

our classication of vortices is on a level separate to the question of stability.

classication relies on the group actions on the tangent space, whereas stability

relies on the topology of the vacuum manifold.

2.1 the abelian-higgs vortex

this is the archetypal model of a vortex, the nielsen-olesen vortex, within the

simplest theory that contains such vortices.

for simplicity, we consider only straight, static vortices, and impose cylindrical

symmetry.

the abelian-higgs model consists of a one-dimensional complex scalar eld cou-

pled to a u(1) gauge potential a, with a symmetry breaking landau potential.

(note that, to conform with our general notation, we take the gauge potential a

to be pure imaginary.) the lagrangian is of the form

l[, a] =

f  +

with

f = a  a,

d = ( + qa) ,

v [] =

(  2)2.

(16a)

(16b)

(16c)

semi-local, or dynamical, stability is slightly more subtle; we discuss this later

5

here  > 0 and  are parameters of the potential, and q the gauge coupling constant.

for 2 > 0 the trivial vacuum is unstable and decays to a vacuum of the form

0 = ei. perturbations around this comprise a eld theory consisting of a massive

gauge eld interacting with a massive scalar eld; this theory having no manifest

gauge symmetry. all this information is encoded within the symmetry breaking

u(1)  1.

(17)

the gauge symmetry breaking leads to the existence of vortex solutions. in the

temporal gauge a0 = 0, they have the form of the nielsen-olesen ansatz:

(r, ) = fno(r)ein,

a(r, ) =

gno(r)

r

with boundary conditions

 in
q ! ,

(18a)

(18b)

fno(0) = gno(0) = 0, and fno() = gno() = 1,

(19)

asymptotically the congurations wind around the possible degenerate vacua, and

then over the intervening space the elds continuously interpolate. the n = 1

solutions are stable because there is no way they may be continuously deformed

to the vacuum (x) = 0 whilst keeping the asymptotic eld within the vacuum

manifold. the asymptotic eld conguration, which forms a circle in the space

of scalar eld values, winds around the spatial circle at innity  since this map

has topological degree it may not be continuously deformed to other inequivalent

situations.

2.2 vortices in general gauge theories

we now embed the archetypal u(1)  1 vortex (18a,18b) within a larger theory:

g  h





u(1)  1.

the general vortex ansatz is

h  u(1) = 1

(20)

(r, ) = fno(r)d(ex)0,

a(r, ) =

x .

gno(r)

r

6

(21a)

(21b)

where x  m is the generator of the embedded u(1). in this paper we shall classify

vortex solutions of this form.

it should be remarked that the ansatz (21a, 21b) is not the most general we

could assume. the lowest-energy conguration with these boundary conditions may

in some cases be distorted from the pure embedded-vortex solution, though the

distortions are irrelevant for the classication.

asymptotically the scalar eld winds around a geodesic d(ex)0 on the vac-

uum manifold d(g)0, and nearer the core the solution continuously interpolates

over a two dimensional surface within v containing this geodesic. there could be

components of the scalar eld  out of this surface that vanish at innity but are

non-zero in the core [4]. however, such components do not aect the classication

of the vortex solutions, so we may ignore them here.

the asymptotic gauge eld in the minimum-energy conguration is in the direc-

tion of x  m, because if we were to add any component in h, the eect would

be to leave the scalar eld unchanged but to add an extra term to the gauge-eld

magnetic energy. though one should note that when gauge eld takes components

within more than one simple part of g the various components may have dierent

radial dependence, and so near the core there may be components in h. again,

however, these components in h do not aect the classication.

2.2.1 vortex generators

we shall always consider vortices in the temporal gauge, and assume cylindrical

symmetry, i.e. their eld values are cylindrically symmetric, and stationary in time.

non-trivial gauge transformations that respect this gauge are the global (or rigid)

gauge transformations where g(x) in eq. (2a,2b) is independent of x.

by eq. (11) we can use the gauge freedom of g to x 0. then vortex solutions

are dened by just one variable, the vortex generator x  m. to classify vortex

solutions, we must answer the questions: which generators x  m dene vortex

solutions? and which of those are gauge equivalent?

the remaining gauge freedom corresponds to global transformations by elements

h  h, the residual symmetry group. two vortices described by ansatze of the form

(21a, 21b) are gauge equivalent if and only if they are related by such a transforma-

7

tion. since 0 is unaltered, the only eect is to transform the generator x  m:

x 7 ad(h)x, with h  h,

(22)

where ad is the adjoint representation of g acting on g.

geometrically, the scalar boundary conditions of a vortex describe a geodesic

d(ex)0 on the vacuum manifold, with the gauge potential being dened from the
tangent vector to the corresponding curve ex in g. global gauge transformations

dened by elements of h keep the point 0 xed, and rotate the geodesic around

this point. thus vortex generators that may be rotated into one another by ad(h)

dene gauge equivalent vortices.

there are two constraints that the vortex ansatz must obey [5]:

(i) closure. the asymptotic scalar eld forms a closed geodesic with d(e2x)0 =
0. equivalently, e2x  h.

(ii) the ansatz is a solution to the equations of motion. an argument of [1] identies

this to be when: elds in the vortex do not induce currents perpendicular (in lie

algebra space) to it. this can be shown to be equivalent to (see appendix a):

if x is a vortex generator, then for all x  such that hx, x i = 0 one
has hd(x)0, d(x )0i = 0.

in other words the map x 7 d(x)0 is conformal over the classes of generators

that dene vortex solutions.

2.2.2 family structure of vortex solutions

consider the action of ad(h) on m. in general, m may be reducible; let us write

m = m1      mn

(23)

where mi is (real) irreducible under the action of ad(h). in appendix b we show

that the (real) inner products on v and m are related upon this decomposition by:

hd(xi)0, d(yj)0i = ijhxi, yji, xi  mi, yj  mj,

(24)

where i =

k d(xi)0 k

k xi k

,

and i is constant upon its particular mi.

8

comparing eq. (24) with condition (ii) above we see that generally, vortex gen-

erators lie only in the individual mis, but for some pairs of values of gauge coupling

constants, dened by the condition,

i(q1,    , qn) =

k d(xi)0 k

k xi k

=

k d(xj)0 k

k xj k

= j(q1,    , qn),

(25)

the solution space increases, encompassing combinations of vortices with generators

in mi and vortices with generators in mj. then the vortex generators are those

generators that close in mi  mj; such vortices we dub combination vortices.

leaving aside the special case of combination vortices, we may concentrate on

vortices described by generators x in one specic irreducible subspace mi. first,

we show that every x is equivalent to one lying in a subspace that plays the same

role as a cartan subalgebra in a lie algebra.

for each mi one may dene a rank analogous to the rank of a lie group: the rank

r of mi is the maximum number of linearly independent commuting generators in

mi. let t1, . . . , tr be such a set, and consider the algebra, t say, that they generate.

it is an abelian subalgebra of g, and t = exp t is an abelian subgroup of g, a

torus.

then, in general we conjecture that vortex generators are given by the following

crucial result:

for mi of rank r, we can nd a set of linearly independent commuting

generators {t1, . . . , tr} such that the x  mi satisfying the closure

condition may be written

x = ad(h)

lktk,

rxk=1

(26)

with h  h, and lk  z.

in sec. (3) we prove the above result for two categories of vacuum manifolds: sym-

metric spaces, and symmetric spaces that are modied to admit semi-local vortices.

practically, these two situations cover most cases of physical relevance, although we

suspect that the result is true generally.

9

2.2.3 gauge equivalent embedded vortices

each of the vortices labelled by the set of coecients {lj} has an orbit of gauge

equivalent solutions associated with it,

ad(h)

rxk=1

lktk

= h/h{lj },

where h{lj } = {h  h : ad(h)

lktk =

rxk=1

lktk}.

rxk=1

(27a)

(27b)

generally these orbits dier in structure depending upon which element of the lattice

of coecients is considered.

in addition, these orbits may contain vortex generators with dierent sets of co-

ecients {lj} that are gauge equivalent. in fact, h acts as a discrete transformation

group on the lattice l. we can construct this group as follows.

first, dene the subgroup of h that maps t into itself:

n(t ) = {h  h : ad(h)t = t }.

(28)

then, introduce the subgroup which leaves each point of the lattice unaltered:

b(t ) = {h  h : ad(h)tk = tk, k = 1, . . . , r}.

(29)

the eective transformation group on the lattice l is the quotient group k =

n(t )/b(t ). thus nally the set of gauge-inequivalent vortex generators in mi is

the quotient l/k, comprising equivalence classes of lattice points under the induced

action of k.

we conjecture that the eect of k upon the lattice l allows us to enumerate

gauge inequivalent vortex generators by l1      lr for those mis of dimension

larger than one. this conjecture is largely motivated by example (5.3), and is beyond

the scope of the present work to prove.

this completes the classication of vortex generators in each of the subspaces

mi. of course, if the coupling constants allow then one may also have combination

vortex generators, as described above.

10

3 symmetric spaces and the conjugacy of max-

imal tori

the goal of this section is to discuss the mathematics of, and prove, the following

crucial result upon vacuum manifolds that are either compact symmetric spaces or

compact symmetric spaces that are modied to admit semi-local vortices:

for mi of rank r, we can nd a set of linearly independent commuting

generators {t1, . . . , tr} such that the x  mi satisfying the closure

condition may be written

with h  h, and lk  z.

x = ad(h)

lktk,

rxk=1

(30)

before establishing the above result for our cases of interest, we shall discuss

some basic properties of symmetric spaces that will be useful as a background to

the work in this paper [6].

there are several ways of characterising when the vacuum manifold g/h is a

symmetric space and we nd the most convenient in the context of this work to be:

g/h is a symmetric space if the decomposition g = h  m obeys

[m, m]  h.

(31)

this has the consequence (cartan, [7]) that m may be written as m = exp(m),
and then g has the polar decomposition into cosets g = exp(m)h. geodesics in

exp(m) are easily found, and those passing through 1 may be written as x(t) =

exp(xt) with x  m.

other important features of symmetric spaces may be found from the above

structure, such as a well dened composition of elements in m relating to a symmetry

operation upon geodesics. however these features are not central to this paper and

we shall not discuss them further.

m0 m+; where m0 is the toroidal part of m, written m0 = u(1)k, and m+

cartan has proved that the compact symmetric spaces can be written as m =
= g/h,
with g semi simple, is the rest. we shall establish the main result of this section

rstly upon m0, and then m+, before discussing the case when m has been modied

from a symmetric space so as to admit semi-local vortices.

11

3.1 toroidal m0

= g/h with g = u(1)k
for the toroidal part of the vacuum m0 we may write m0
and h = 1. trivially then m0 = g = u(1)k and then [m0, m0] = 0  h. eq. (26)

is trivial in such a case, since each mi is one-dimensional.

3.2 non-toroidal m+

for the non-toroidal part of a symmetric vacuum m+, cartan has shown that m+

=
g/h where g is a semi-simple lie group and h is embedded in g according to

eq. (31) above. we now establish the main result of this section for such cases.

firstly we establish the following, a variant of hunts lemma [8]:

for x, y  mi there exists h0  h such that [ad(h0)x, y ] = 0.

this result is proved by considering a function f : h  r dened by

f (h) = had(h)x, y i.

(32)

since this is a bounded real function on a compact domain, it attains it maximum,

say at a point h0. then for any k  h,

= had(k)ad(h0)x, y i = hk, [ad(h0)x, y ]i.

(33)

0 =

d
dt

f (ekth0)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

finally, since g  h denes a symmetric space, [ad(h0)x, y ]  h and therefore

vanishes, proving the lemma.

from this result, in three steps we may establish our main result when the

vacuum is a symmetric space.

firstly, there exists y  mi such that the centraliser c of y in mi

c(y ) = {u  mi : [y, u] = 0},

(34)

is precisely t . this follows by considering elements y that dene paths {exp(y ) :

  r} dense in t = exp(t ). then for any z  mi such that [z, y ] = 0, also

[z, t ] = 0 and thus, by maximality, z  t .

next, we use the result established above. thus for any x  mi there exists

h0  h such that ad(h0)x  c(y ). hence, we have shown that there exists h0  h

with ad(h0)x  t .

12

finally, we note that within t , the generators x that satisfy the condition of

closure, e2x  h, obviously form a lattice, l say, and we can choose the generators

tj so that this comprises precisely the linear combinations with integer coecients,

pj ljtj, lj  z.

3.3 m admits semi-local vortices

here we deal with the situation when m = g/h admits semi-local vortices, and
has been modied from a symmetric space. specically we are going to consider

vacuum manifolds of the form

m =

k  a/z

h

,

(35)

where k is semi-simple, a is abelian and connected, z is a nite subgroup, and h

is isomorphic to a subgroup l of k, such that k/l is a compact symmetric space.

perhaps the easiest way to see the structure of eq. (35) is to represent it by a

two step symmetry breaking:

g = k  a  l  a = h  c(l)  a

 h = h  b,

(36)

where here h  is the semi-simple part of l, c(l) is the connected centre of l, and
b = c(l).

decomposing g = h  m, we see that m is made up of two parts, and may be

written as m = p  b, where

k = l  p,

c(l)  a = b  b.

(37a)

(37b)

from this decomposition the main result (26) of this section can be established: it

is trivially true upon b and, because k/l is a symmetric space, it is true also on

p.

13

4 the stability of vortices in general gauge the-

ories

the stability of the vortices is on a level separate from the family structure discussed

above, though clearly all vortices in the same family have the same stability structure

since all such vortices are gauge equivalent.

classical stability is determined by the energetics of the vortex solution. if it is

energetically favourable for a vortex solution to continuously relax to the vacuum

then that vortex is unstable. this is the general situation for vortex solutions,

and generally one needs some property of the scalar-gauge theory to prop-up the

solution, so as to make the conguration a local minimum of the energy. there

are two ways this may be achieved: either through the topology of the vacuum

manifold, or through the dynamics of the solution [9]. we discuss each of these

cases separately.

4.1 topological stability

topological stability arises through the vacuum manifold not being simply con-

nected, so that

1(g/h) 6= 0.

(38)

vortex families whose boundary conditions are the elements of the non-trivial ho-

motopy classes of eq. (38) are imbued with a conserved topological charge, which

in appropriate cases guarantees their stability. physically, the vacuum manifold

contains loops that are incontractible, so that the vortex solutions corresponding to

such loops are topologically obstructed from continuously deforming to the vacuum.

there are two distinct ways in which topological stability may occur: either

through an abelian or a non-abelian part of the symmetry breaking. these two

dierent situations also have contrasting properties for their family structure, and

the nature of their stability. therefore we discuss these two cases separately.

abelian topological vortices are present for a symmetry breaking scheme such as

g = g  a/z  h  g,

(39)

14

where a is an abelian subgroup, a torus

a = u(1)1      u(1)n

and z is a nite group. then 1(g/h) takes the form

1(g/h) = p  zn ,

(40)

(41)

where p is a nite group. the abelian topologically stable vortices have boundary

conditions that belong to non-trivial zn homotopy classes.

the lie algebra of g decomposes under the adjoint action of h into

g = h  m  a.

(42)

the abelian subalgebra a is generated by n commuting generators {tk}. we

can always choose these so that the elements satisfying the closure condition are

given by pk lktk, though only some of these may actually correspond to stable

vortices. vortices with distinct values of the quantum numbers lk are necessarily

gauge inequivalent; there is no non-trivial family structure.

note that a may be described as the intersection of m and the centre c of the

lie algebra g.

non-abelian topological stability can arise from elements outside the centre of

the group; if for example the vacuum manifold g/h has the form of the quotient of a

simply connected manifold m by a discrete group zn, then 1(g/h) = 1(m/zn) =

zn. this gives the vortex generators in the relevant mi subspaces a mod-n topolog-

ical charge, imparting stability to the corresponding vortex solutions. such stable

vortices correspond to fractional quantum embedded vortices, and the solutions have

non-trivial family structure because necessarily dim(mi) > 1.

4.2 dynamical stability

even when there is no topology to stabilise a vortex solution there may be non-

trivial dynamics making the decay modes of the vortex energetically unfavourable:

this is called dynamical stability [9]. often this occurs when an abelian symmetry

couples much more strongly than a non-abelian symmetry; then the decay modes

15

cost large gradient energies that cannot be compensated by inducing a non-abelian

gauge eld.

such vortices are solutions to gauge theories that have gauge coupling constants

close to a semi-local limit, where the scalar-gauge theory admits semi-local vortices.

preskill [10], has shown that semi-local vortices are solutions to gauge theories of

the form

gglobal  u(1)local  h, with h  u(1)local = 1,

(43)

where the suces global and local represent non-gauge and gauged symmetries,

respectively. requiring that this does not admit topological vortices leads to the

condition h 6 gglobal. note that eq. (43) need only be a sub-part of a more general

symmetry breaking.

thus we dene a semi-local limit of a gauge theory to be a limit of the gauge

coupling constants {qf } in which part of the gauge theory takes the form in eq. (43).

recall that the formal limit of taking a coupling constant qf  0 decouples the gauge

eld and makes the corresponding gauge symmetry global. thus dynamically stable

vortices are generated by the corresponding generator of semi-local vortices, but

with the gauge coupling constants close to those in the semi-local limit.

the above may be expressed succinctly in terms of the group theory, describing

which vortex generators give solutions that may be dynamically stable. recall that

c is the centre of the lie algebra g, and denote the projection of an element x  g

into m by prm(x). we then have the following:

vortex generators x  prm(c) such that x 6 c dene embedded vortices
that are stable in a well dened semi-local limit of the model and are thus

dynamically stable for a region of parameter space around that semi-local

limit.

we also have a useful subresult about the dimension of mis for such vortices:

vortices with a stable semi-local limit are always generated by generators

in one dimensional mis.

the proofs are given in appendix c.

16

together these give a nice interpretation of the role of semi-locality: considering

mi  prm(c), then the embedding mi  g is determined by the coupling con-
stants {qi}. essentially the semi-local limit is for coupling constants such that the

embedding is mi  u(1)local. then dynamical stability occurs when the embedding

is close to this.

5 examples

this section illustrates principles discussed generally in the preceding sections.

5.1 su (2)  1

this is an examples of a symmetry breaking that contains hidden symmetries.

clearly, h = 0 and m = su(2). then, since m is a lie algebra, the relation

[m, m] = m holds.

however the vacuum manifold is a three-sphere embedded in c2, with an isom-

etry group

i = i(s3) = su(2)l  su(2)g,

(44)

which is larger than the gauge group. the su(2)l represents the left actions upon
a complex doublet, with generators represented by xa =  1
a hidden global symmetry with generators y1 =  1
 1

2 ia, and the su(2)g is
2 i2k, and y3 =
2i12. here k is the complex conjugation operator and a are the pauli spin

2 2k, y2 = 1

matrices.

then the stability group of i upon a point of m is

j = su(2)l+g,

(45)

the diagonal subgroup lying between su(2)l and su(2)g. hence the actual symmetry

breaking is

su(2)l  su(2)g  su(2)l+g,

(46)

which contains the gauge symmetry breaking su(2)l  1, and has additional global

symmetry su(2)g. dening i = j  n one can easily verify [n , n ]  j .

it is interesting to note that the above model is the weinberg-salam model, with

electroweak mixing angle sin w = 0.

17

5.2 su (2)  u (1)  u (1)

the gauge symmetry su(2)  u(1) acts on a two-dimensional complex scalar eld
 by the fundamental representation. the generators of su(2) are xa =  1
the u(1) generator is x0 = 1

2 ia and

2i12.

the vacuum manifold is

m =

su(2)  u(1)

u(1)

=

su(2)  su(2)

su(2)diag

,

(47)

thus the isometry group is i = su(2)  su(2). this is in general not a symmetry

group of the theory unless sinw = 0.

the inner product on su(2)  u(1)  gl(c2) is obtained from appendix b:

hx, y i = 2s1trxy 

s2
4

trxtry.

(48)

to obtain the usual scalar-gauge coupling (50), s1 and s2 are related to the hyper-
charge g and isospin g coupling constants such that

hx, y i = 

1

g2n2trxy + (cot2 w  1)trxtryo ,

(49)

with tan w = g/g. the unit norm generators are then gxa and gx0, and thus the
components of a gauge eld a couple to  as

a = (gw 

a xa + gy x0).

(50)

taking the vacuum to be dened from 0 = v(0 1) the decomposition g =

h  m takes the form

with ,  real and  complex. then under ad(h), m decomposes to the irreducible

subspaces m = m1  m2, with

m1 =

i cos 2w

0

additionally pr(u(1)y ) = m1.

0

i



and m2 =

 .

(52)

thus we obtain a one-parameter family of gauge equivalent unstable embedded

vortices and a gauge invariant embedded vortex with a stable semi-local limit. these

are identied as the w-strings and z-string of the weinberg-salam model.

this is an example of a symmetry breaking where the irreducible mis are of a

non-trivial rank.

the gauge group g = su(5) acts on the scalar eld   g by the adjoint action.

for vacuum expectation value

that rank(m) = 2, for example with generators t1, t2 such that

, with a1 =

,

(56)

then [t1, t2] = 0 and there are no other linearly independent generators that com-

mute with both of these.

then using eq. (26) the vortex generators in m are:

x = ad(h) (l1t1 + l2t2) ,

(57)

with li  z and h  h. these generators form a z2 lattice of solutions (l1, l2), with

an orbit of solutions generated by ad(h) from each point of the lattice. however,

19

there is degeneracy since it is easy to nd h1, h2  h such that

ad(h1)(l1t1 + l2t2) = l2t1 + l1t2,

ad(h2)(l1t1 + l2t2) = l1t1 + l2t2.

(58a)

(58b)

together these generate the discrete group of actions ad(k) that takes the pair

(l1, l2) to the set of eight pairs {(l1, l2), (l1, l2), (l2, l1), (l2, l1)}. then

the set of gauge inequivalent embedded vortex generators in su(5) are those in

eq. (57), but with (l1, l2) restricted to the octant l1  l2  0.

to explicitly give an example of a vortex we give the (1, 0) solution:

(r, ) = fno(r)ad(et1)0,

a(r, ) =

gno(r)

where aij = i(i1j1  i4j4). a non-trivial geodesic, that is certainly not contained

within a plane through the origin.

6 conclusions

we conclude by briey summarising our classication.

we consider minimal, gauge invariant theories (6) of symmetry breaking g  h,

where h  g are compact lie groups. then the following structure is required:

writing g = h  m, one splits m = m1      mn, the irreducible subspaces of

m under ad(h).

then cylindrically symmetric, time independent vortex solutions are of the form

(r, ) = fno(r)d(ex)0,

a(r, ) =

gno(r)

r

x .

with x  mi specied by the following result, which has been rigorously established

for g/h a symmetric space or a symmetric space modied to admit semi-local

vortices:

20

for mi of rank r, we can nd a set of linearly independent commuting

generators {t1, . . . , tr} such that the x  mi satisfying the closure

condition may be written

x = ad(h)

lktk,

rxk=1

with h  h, and lk  z.

generally this classies all vortices of the embedded nielsen-olesen type, however

for certain critical values of the ratios of gauge coupling constants the solution set

may increase to include combination vortices also, with generators x lying between

mi and mj.

stability of vortices may be of two types. firstly, topological stability given

by the non-trivial rst homotopy classes of g/h. secondly, dynamical stability,

specied by the following result:

vortex generators x  prm(c) such that x 6 c dene embedded vortices
that are stable in a well dened semi-local limit of the model and are thus

dynamically stable for a region of parameter space around that semi-local

limit.

such vortex generators always lie in one-dimensional mis.

we conjecture that the above classication also holds true in general.

naturally splits g globally into g = gemb  g

v 
emb() where vemb() = d(ex)(r0 + rd(xemb)0), with r the real numberline.

the rst condition constrains the scalar potential and may restrict combination

vortex solutions. the second we rephrase: using the identity hd(g), i = 0 for

  v,

hd(x ), vemb()i = 0  hd(x )d(ex)0, d(ex)d(x)0i = 0

 hd(ad(ex)x )0, d(x)0i = 0,

(65)

 hd(x )0, d(x)0i = 0.

the last step by virtue of gemb being a subgroup of g implies that ad(ex)g
g

emb =

emb.

one should note that the above proof is a modied version of that given in

[2], to encompass the situation when vemb is dened locally.

in this context our

denition of an embedded defect is more general than that discussed in [1], where

they considered vemb to be independent of   which is equivalent to assuming that
d(ex)0 is a circle centred on the origin within v. generically, geodesics on non-

spherical homogenous spaces are not of this form  an example of which is given

in sec. (5.3).

22

appendix b: inner product structures on v and g

the inner product on v is given by the (real) euclidean inner product. considering

an element v  v as a column vector the form we shall use is:

hv1, v2i = re[v

1v2].

(66)

this inner product is isometric under automorphisms of v.

to construct a non-degenerate ad(g)-invariant inner product on g, we start by

splitting it into its commuting subalgebras, g1      gn, where each gf is either

simple or a one-dimensional u(1) algebra. for each gf there is a natural invariant

scalar product {, }f , unique up to a factor [12]. on a u(1) algebra, we may set
{x, x}f = 1, where x is the generator normalised so that e2x = 1. upon a

simple gf it is (proportional to) the killing form; regarding gf as a matrix algebra

embedded in gl(cp) for some p, the inner product may be dened by

{x, y }f = pre[tr(x y )].

then the most general ad(g)-invariant scalar product on g is

hx, y i =

nxf =1

sf {xf , yf }f ,

(67)

(68)

for arbitrary values of the scaling factors sf , where x = x1 +    + xn, y =

y1 +    + yn and xf , yf  gf . the scales sf relate to the norm on each gf ; for

xf  gf such that {xf , xf } = 1 the unit norm generator with respect to h, i is

written qf xf , with qf a function of {s1,    , sn}.

these two inner products over their respective spaces are related by the following

result:

theorem the (real) inner product on v is related to the inner product on m by

hd(xi)v, d(yj)vi = ijhxi, yji, xi  mi, yj  mj,

where i =

k d(xi)v k

k xi k

.

each i is constant upon its particular mi.

the theorem is original to this paper, although it is a fairly simple application of

23

linear algebra. it is a consequence of two inner products having a similar invariance,

and is most easily derived from:

lemma consider h, i1 and h, i2 two (real) inner products on v. then v decom-

poses into v1      vn such that

hvi, vji2 = ijhvi, vji1, vi  mi, vj  mj.

(69)

each i is constant over its particular vi.

proof choosing a basis for v orthonormal with respect to h, i1, the inner products
can be written hu, vi1 = uv and hu, vi2 = uav, with u, v  v, with a a non-
degenerate symmetric matrix. denote the eigenspaces of a by v1      vn, with
corresponding eigenvalues 2

i , then for vi  vi

hvi, vji2 = v

i avj = ijv

i vj.

(70)

finally it is clear that i is constant over vi because it is an eigenvalue, but also

i =k vi k2 / k vi k1 2

then from this lemma the theorem is easily proved:

proof

firstly, let hx, y i1 denote the usual ad(g) invariant inner product over

g, but restricted to m; note that it is ad(h) invariant.

then one may induce a second inner product on m from that on v: this takes

the form hx, y i2 = hd(x)v, d(y )vi. again this inner product is ad(h) invariant

over m.

from the lemma m reduces to fm1      fmk such that for x  fmi, y  fmj

hd(x)v, d(y )vi = ijhx, y i.

(71)

also ad(h) invariant (ad(h)x) = (x), and thus also constant over each mi.

here i = (xi) =k d(xi)v k / k xi k is constant over each fmi. however (x) is
hence each fmi is a direct sum of mis and eq. (71) is true for xi  mi, yj  mj.

appendix c: dynamical stability proofs

for completeness we give the following proofs to results stated in section (4.2).

24

theorem vortex generators x  prm(c) such that x 6 c dene embedded vortices
that are stable in a well dened semi-local limit of the model and are thus dynamically

stable for a region of parameter space around that semi-local limit.

proof

consider x  prm(c), such that it generates a closed geodesic. then
x = xc + xh, with xc  c, such that prm(xc) = x, generating a u(1)c  c and
xh  h generating a u(1)h  h. these dene a decomposition of the symmetry

breaking of the lie algebras:

g = g  u(1)c  h = h  u(1)h,

(72)

with u(1)c  h = 1. it is now clear that the appropriate semi-local limit to obtain a

symmetry breaking of the form eq. (43) is to make coupling constants appertaining

to g vanish. the corresponding vortex generator is x. this completes the proof.

2

lemma vortices with a stable semi-local limit are always generated by generators

in one dimensional mis.

proof the proof that if mi  prm(c) then dim(mi) = 1 relies on the following
if one writes mker as the collection of one dimensional mis then
identication:

necessarily mker = {x  m : ad(h)x = x}. now we are reduced to showing

prm(c)  mker.

consider (xc+xh)  prm(c), with xc  c and xh  h. then [h, xc+xh]  m.
but also [h, xc + xh] = [h, xh]  h. hence [h, xc + xh] = 0, and equivalently

ad(h)(xc + xh) = xc + xh, proving the result. 2
