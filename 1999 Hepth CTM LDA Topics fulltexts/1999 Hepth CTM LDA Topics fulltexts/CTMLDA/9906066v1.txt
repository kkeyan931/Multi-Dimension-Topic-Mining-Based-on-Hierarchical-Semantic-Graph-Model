abstract

the character of the exceptional series of representations of su (1, 1) is de-

termined by using bargmanns realization of the representation in the hilbert

space h of functions dened on the unit circle. the construction of the

integral kernel of the group ring turns out to be especially involved because

of the non-local metric appearing in the scalar product with respect to which

the representations are unitary. since the non-local metric disappears in the

momentum space i.e. in the space of the fourier coecients the integral

kernel is constructed in the momentum space, which is transformed back to

yield the integral kernel of the group ring in h. the rest of the procedure is

parallel to that for the principal series treated in a previous paper. the main

advantage of this method is that the entire analysis can be carried out within

the canonical framework of bargmann.

1. introduction

it is well known that the traditional denition of character breaks down for innite

dimensional representations of locally compact groups. for such representations character

was dened by gelfand1 and coworkers as

t r(tx) = z k(z, z)d(z)

where k(z, z1) is the integral kernel of the group ring

txf (z) = z k(z, z1)f (z1)d(z1).

the operator tx of the group ring is dened by

tx = z d(g)x(g)tg

where x(g) is a test function on the group which vanishes outside a bounded set, d(g) is

the left and right invariant measure (assumed coincident) on the group and g  tg is a
unitary representation of the group realized in the hilbert space h of functions f (z) with

the scalar product

(f, g) = z f (z)g(z)d(z).

it was shown by gelfand1 and coworkers that t r(tx) can be written in the form

t r(tx) = z x(g)(g)d(g).

(1.1)

the function (g) is the character of the representation g  tg.

in a previous paper2 (i) the character problems of su(2) and su(1, 1) were reexamined

from the standpoint of a physicist by employing the powerful hilbert space method of

bargmann3 and segal4 which was shown to yield a completely unied treatment for su(2)

and the discrete series of representations of su(1, 1). the main advantage of this method

is that the entire analysis can be carried out within the canonical framework of bargmann5.

the representations of the positive discrete series were realized in i in the hilbert space of

3

functions analytic within the open unit disc. for the principal series the carrier space was

chosen to be the hilbert space of functions dened on the unit circle.

it is the object of this paper to extend the method of i to the exceptional or the sup-

plementary series of representations of su(1, 1). this representation is realized, as for the

principal series, in the space of functions dened on the unit circle. the construction of the

integral kernel of the group ring is, however, more involved for the exceptional representa-

tions because the scalar product contains a nonlocal metric5,6

this diculty is resolved by expanding the functions in fourier series

since the nonlocal metric disappears in the momentum space i.e. in the space of the

fourier coecients am the integral kernel is constructed in the momentum space, which

is transformed back to yield the integral kernel of the group ring

txf () =

(1.3)

in the space of the functions f (). the rest of the procedure is parallel to that for the

principal series of representations as outlined in i. an important common feature of the

principal and supplementary series is that the elliptic elements of su(1, 1) do not contribute

to their character.

2. the exceptional representations of the group su (1, 1)

to make this paper self-contained we start with the basic properties of the group su(1, 1)

which consists of pseudounitary unimodular matrices

4

u = 


 

 

,




||2  ||2 = 1

and is isomorphic to the group sl(2,r) of real unimodular matrices,

g = 


a b

c d

,




ad  bc = 1.

a particular choice of the isomorphism kernel is

so that

 =

1
2

1 i

i 1







u = g1

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

 =

1
2

[(a + d)  i(b  c)] ,

 =

1
2

[(b + c)  i(a  d)] .

(2.4)

the elements of the group su(1,1) may be divided into three subsets :

(a)elliptic,

(b)hyperbolic and (c)parabolic. we dene them as follows. let  = 1 + i2,  = 1 + i2

so that

2
1 + 2

2  2

1  2

2 = 1.

the elliptic elements are those for which

2  2
2

1  2

2 > 0.

hence if we set

we have



2 = q2

2  2

1  2

2

1 + 2
2

2 = 1

5

so that 1 < 1 < 1.

on the other hand the hyperbolic elements of su(1,1) are those for which

2
2  2

1  2

2 < 0.

hence if we write

we have



2 = q2

1 + 2

2  2

2

1  2
2

2 = 1

(2.5)

so that |1| > 1.

we exclude the parabolic class corresponding to

2 = q2

1 + 2
2

as this is a submanifold of lower dimensions.

if we diagonalize the su(1,1) matrix ( 2.1), the eigenvalues are given by

1  1

 = 1 q2
2 ), 0 < 0 < 2 so that  = exp(i 0

2 ). for the hyper-

2,  = sgn we obtain the eigenvalues as

for the elliptic elements 1 = cos( 0
bolic elements |1| > 1 so that setting 1 =  cosh t
 exp( t

2 ). since the diagonal matrix

(t) = 


sgn esgn( t
2 )

0

0

sgn esgn( t
2 )




(2.6)

belongs to sl(2,r), it can be regarded as the diagonal form of the matrix g given by equa-
tions( 2.2) and ( 2.4) with |1| = |a+d|
following bargmann we realize the representations of the exceptional series in the hilbert

.

space h of functions dened on the unit circle. the nite element of the group in this

realization is given by

6

tuf (z) = |z + |21f  z + 
z + !

where

1

z = ei,

0 <  < 2.

this representation is unitary with respect to the scalar product

k = 1, 2;

b( 1

.

(2.10)

the integral converges in the usual sense for 0 <  < 1

2 . for  1

2 <  < 0 the integral is to

be understood in the sense of its regularization7.

setting z = iei the nite group element takes the form,

tuf (iei) = |  iei + |21f  iei + 
iei + ! .

we now introduce as usual the operator of the group ring

tx = z d(u)x(u)tu

(2.11)

(2.12)

where x(u) is an arbitrary test function on the group which vanishes outside a bounded set

and d(u) is the left and right invariant measure on the group. the action of the operator

tx is given by

txf (iei) = z d(u)x(u)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)iei 

2 + ei 

21

f 


2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

iei 
iei

 .

(2.13)

we now make a left translation

where

u  1 u

7

 = 


ei/2

ei/2

.




we, therefore, obtain

txf (iei) = z d(u)x(1u) | i +  |21f  i + 
i + ! .

(2.14)

we now map the su(1, 1) matrix u onto the sl(2, r) matrix g by using the isomorphism

kernel  given by (2.3) and (2.4) and perform the iwasawa decomposition

g = k 2

(2.15)

where

k = 


k11 k12

0 k22




,

k11k22 = 1

(2.16)

belongs to the subgroup k of real triangular matrices of determinant unity and 2  
where  is the subgroup of pure rotation matrices

2 = 


cos(2/2)  sin(2/2)
cos(2/2)
sin(2/2)




.

(2.17)

as in i we now introduce the following convention. the letters without a bar below it will

denote the sl(2, r) matrices or its subgroups and those with a bar below it will denote

their su(1, 1) image. for instance

k =  k 1 =

1
2

k11 + k22  ik12
k12 + i(k11  k22)



2 = 


ei2/2

0

0

ei2/2

k12  i(k11  k22)
k11 + k22 + ik12




.




thus the decomposition (2.15) can also be written as

u = k 2

8

(2.18)

which yields

i  +  =  i k22 ei2/2;

i  +  = k22 ei2/2.

hence setting f (iei) = g() we obtain,

tx g() = z x(1 k 2) | k22 |21 g(2) d(u).

(2.19)

it can be shown that under the decomposition (2.15) or equivalently (2.18) the invariant

measure decomposes as

d(u) =

1
2

dl(g) =

1
2

dr(g) =

1
4

dl(k) d2.

substituting the decomposition (2.20) in eqn. (2.19) we have

tx g() = z k(, 2) g(2) d2

where

k(, 2) =

1

4 z x(1 k 2) | k22 |21 dl(k).

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

it must be pointed out that eqn. (2.21) does not yield the integral kernel of the operator tx

of the group ring because tx now is an operator in the space h in which the scalar product

is given by eqn.(2.9). it is, therefore, not clear a priori that

z k(, )d

(2.23)

is the trace of the operator tx. nevertheless, we shall show that (2.23) is the trace of the

operator tx.

to write the action of tx on g() in the form consistent with the scalar product (2.9) we

pass over to the momentum space (space of the fourier coecients)

where

g() =

1

(2.25)

(2.28)

||g||2 =



xm= |am|2m

we can, therefore, dene the scalar product in the momentum space as

(a, b) = x ambmm

(2.29)

(2.30)

where m as given by eqn.(2.28) is a positive metric.

the operator of the group ring in the momentum space is given by

(2.35)

(2.36)

(2.37)

setting z = ei the integral on the r.h.s. can be recast as an integral over the unit circle

s. since the only singularities of the subsequent integrand are the branch points at z = 0

and z = 1 the unit circle s can be deformed to a contour p that starts from z = 1 along

the positive real axis, encircles the point z = 0 once counterclockwise and returns to the

point z = 1 along the positive real axis. the integral is, therefore, the contour integral

representation of the beta function regularized at the origin,

the eqn. (2.38) in conjunction with eqn. (2.10) immediately yields eqn. (2.37).

we now pass over from the momentum space to the space of functions g():

txg() =

we now substitute eqn.(2.37) and (2.25) in eqn.(2.39). thus

(2.43)

which is in the form consistent with the scalar product (2.9). q(, 1) is, therefore, the

integral kernel of the group ring. comparing eqn.(2.43) with eqn.(2.21) we have

k(, 2) =

c

q(, 1)ei( 1

from eqn.(2.33) t r(tx) is given by

t r(tx) =

substituting the integral representation (2.37) in eqn.(2.45) we obtain

(2.45)

t r(tx) =

(2.46)

now from eqns.(2.35) and (2.41)

nn =

2 z q(, 1)ein(1)dd1.

(2.47)

the above equation in conjunction with eqn.(2.46) yields,

t r(tx) =

d ei( 1

2 )(1  ei)21 1

xn=

(2.48)

the summation over n appearing on the r.h.s. of eqn.(2.48) can be carried out using the

formula

xn=

ein = ().

eqn.(2.49) immediately leads to

t r(tx) =

c

42 z q(, 1)ei( 1

2 )(1)[(1  ei(1))21dd1.

12

(2.49)

(2.50)

finally using eqn.(2.44) we have

t r (tx) = z k(, )d

1

=

4 z x(1 k ) | k22 |21 dl(k) d.

(2.51)

the rest of the calculation is parallel to that of the principal series outlined in i. however,

to make the paper self-contained we reproduce the steps here.

we assert that

u = 1 k 

represents a hyperbolic element of su(1, 1) because the equation

21 = k11 + k22 =

1
k22

+ k22

(2.52)

has no real solution for 1 = cos 0

2 . thus the elliptic elements of su(1, 1) do not contribute

to the character of the exceptional series of representations.

we shall now show that every hyperbolic element of su(1, 1) ( i.e those with

| 1 |= |(a+d)|

2 > 1 ) can be represented as

or equivalently as

u = 1 k 

g = 1 k .

(2.53)

(2.54)

here k11 = 1, k22 =  are the eigenvalues of the matrix g taken in any order.

we recall that every g  sl(2, r) for the hyperbolic case can be diagonalized as

v g v1 = 

where

 = 


1 0

0 2

,




12 = 1,

1, 2 real,

13

belongs to the subgroup d of real diagonal matrices of determinant unity and
v  sl(2, r). if we write the iwasawa decomposition for v,

then

v = k 

g = 1 k1  k .

now k1  k  k so that writing k = k1  k we have the decomposition (2.54) in which

k11 = 1 = 1,

k22 = 2 = .

if these eigenvalues are distinct then for a given ordering of them the matrices k,  are

determined uniquely by the matrix g. it follows that for a given choice of  the parameters

 and k12 are uniquely determined. we note that there are exactly two representations of

the matrix g by means of formula (2.54) corresponding to two distinct possibilities

k11 = sgn|  |1 = sgn et/2,

k22 = sgn |  |= sgn et/2

k11 = sgn |  |= sgn et/2,

k22 = sgn |  |1= sgn et/2.

let us now remove from k the elements with k11 = k22 = 1. this operation cuts the

group k into two connected disjoint components. neither of these components contains two

matrices which dier only by permutation of the two diagonal elements. in correspondence

with this partition the integral over k is represented in the form of a sum of two integrals,

t r (tx) =

1

4 z

dzk1

dl(k) | k22 |21 x(1 k ) +

1

4 z

dzk2

dl(k) | k22 |21 x(1 k ).

(2.55)

as  runs over the subgroup  and k runs over the components k1 or k2 the matrix

u = 1 k  runs over the hyperbolic elements of the group su(1, 1). we shall now prove

that in k1 or k2

14

dl(k) d =

4 | k22 |

| k22  k11 |

d(u).

(2.56)

to prove this we start from the left invariant dierential

dw = g1 dg

where g  sl(2, r) and dg is the matrix of the dierentials dgpq. i.e.

dg = 


da db

dc dd

.




the elements dw are invariant under the left translation g  g0g. hence choosing a basis in
the set of all dg we immediately obtain a left invariant measure. for instance choosing dw12,

dw21 and dw22 as independent invariant dierentials we arrive at the left invariant measure

on sl(2, r),

dl(g) = dw12dw21dw22.

(2.57)

we now write the decomposition (2.54) as

which yields

where

 g = k 

dw = g1dg = 1 d 

d = k1dk + d 1  k1d 1k.

(2.58)

(2.59)

in accordance with the choice of the independent elements of dw as mentioned above we

choose the independent elements of d as d12, d21 and d22. eqn.(2.58) then leads to

dw11 + dw22 = d11 + d22

dw11dw22  dw12dw21 = d11d22  d12d21.

15

(2.60)

(2.61)

further since t r(d) = t r(dw) = 0 we obtain from eqns.(2.60) and (2.61)

dw2

22 + dw12dw21 = d2

22 + d12d21

which can be written in the form

d2

1 + d2

2  d2

3 = d2

1 + d2

2  d2

3

(2.62)

where

d1 = (dw12 + dw21)/2

d

1 = (d12 + d21)/2

d2 = dw22

d3 = (dw12  dw21)/2

d

d

2 = d22
3 = (d12  d21)/2.

eqn.(2.62) implies that the set d and the set d are connected by a lorentz transformation.

since the volume element d1d2d3 is invariant under such a transformation we have

d1d2d3 = d

1d

2d
3.

(2.63)

but the l.h.s. of eqn.(2.63) is dw12dw21dw22/2 and the r.h.s. is d12d21d22/2. hence using

eqn.(2.57) we easily obtain

dl(g) = d12d21d22.

we now write eqn.(2.59) in the form

d = du + dv

where du = k1dk is the left invariant dierential element on k and

dv = d 1  k1d 1k.

(2.64)

(2.65)

in eqn.(2.64) du is a triangular matrix whose independent nonvanishing elements are chosen

to be du12 and du22 so that

dl(k) = du12du22.

16

on the other hand dv is a 2  2 matrix having one independent element which is chosen
to be dv21. since the jacobian connecting d12d21d22 and du12du22dv21 is a triangular

determinant having 1 along the main diagonal we obtain

dl(g) = dl(k) dv21.

(2.66)

it can now be easily veried that each element k  k with distinct diagonal elements (which
is indeed the case for k1 or k2) can be represented uniquely in the form

k =  1  

(2.67)

where  belongs to the subgroup of real diagonal matrices with unit determinant and   z
where z is a subgroup of k consisting of matrices of the form

 = 


1 12

0 1

.




writing eqn.(2.67) in the form  k =   we obtain

kpp = p ,

12 =

k12

(1  2)

.

(2.68)

using the decomposition (2.67) we can now write eqn.(2.65) in the form

dv =  1 dp 

where

dp = d  1 d 

d =  d  1 ,

d = d 1.

from the above equations it now easily follows

dv21 = | 2  1 |

| 2 |

d
2

.

17

(2.69)

substituting eqn.(2.69) in eqn.(2.66) and using eqns.(2.20) and (2.68) we immediately obtain

eqn.(2.56).

now recalling that in k1, | k22 |= et/2 and in k2, | k22 |= et/2 eqn.(2.55) in conjunction

with (2.56) yields

t r (tx) = z x(u) (u) d(u)

where the character (u) is given by

(u) =

=

et + et
| et/2  et/2 |
cosh t
| sinh t
