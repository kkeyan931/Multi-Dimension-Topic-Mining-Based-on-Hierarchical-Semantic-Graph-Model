abstract

we show that some cpn sigma model solitons can be interpreted as wrapped d-
branes on the holomorphic homology cycles of cpn by verifying that the latter solve
the eld equations of dirac-born-infeld actions in certain supergravity backgrounds.
furthermore, we prove that the non-bps soliton/anti-soliton solutions of the sigma
model can be identied with d-brane/anti-d-brane states. we also compare these
d-brane/anti-d-brane states with those constructed by sen in type ii string theory.
using the moduli space approximation we investigate the dynamics of bps solitons
and that of the associated d-branes. we nd that for the cp1 case the metric on the
moduli space of bps solitons is identical to that of the moduli space of d-branes, but
for cpn with n > 1 we show that the two metrics are not equal. we also consider
the applications to strings and m-theory of other non-bps solutions of yang-mills
theories.

1 introduction

the low energy dynamics of branes in strings and m-theory can be described by kappa-
symmetric actions of dirac-born-infeld (dbi) type [1]. the various classical solutions of
these actions admit a geometric interpretation in terms of brane congurations. in fact
most of these solutions have a bulk interpretation as intersecting branes [2]. the part of
the dbi d-brane action which is quadratic in the derivatives of the elds can be identied
with a yang-mills theory coupled to matter. this has led to a relation between intersecting
brane congurations and classical solutions of yang-mills theories. one of the applications
of this relation is that some classical and quantum properties of yang-mills theory can be
understood as geometric properties of brane congurations [3].

the elds of dbi type actions are scalars, vectors or tensors. in certain cases, there
is a consistent truncation of the dbi action for which the vector and tensor elds are not
active1. the remaining elds are scalars and the action reduces to a dirac one (or nambu-
goto for the string case). then powerful geometrical methods can be used to investigate
static congurations, like those of (generalized) calibrations [4, 5]. in particular bounds
for the energy can be established and the solutions which saturate them can be found.
the part of this reduced dbi action which is quadratic in the derivatives of the scalars
is that of a non-linear sigma model. so the possibility arises to interpret various sigma
model solitons in terms of brane congurations and to relate the calibration bounds to
sigma model ones. an example was presented in [6, 7], where the sigma model lumps
and q-kinks were understood in terms of m-2-brane congurations. in particular it was
observed that the sigma model energy bound associated with lumps on a taub/nut target
space is related to the kahler calibration bound in the eective theory of the m-2-brane in
the presence of a kaluza-klein (kk)-monopole. moreover, it was found that the solutions
that saturate the sigma model bound also solve the corresponding bound of dbi. in this
way the sigma model lumps were embedded in the eective theory of the m-2-brane.

it is expected that other sigma model solitons can be embedded in a brane theory.
however, there are several restrictions. perhaps the most stringent one is that required
by the consistency of the background due to the kappa symmetry of dbi type actions.
in particular, this implies that the sigma model target space should be a solution of the
supergravity eld equations. for many applications, it is also required that the background
preserves a proportion of spacetime supersymmetry.. this further restricts the number of
available sigma model target spaces. supposing that the target space of a sigma model
is consistent, it is far from clear that solutions of the sigma model eld equations will
also solve the dbi eld equations since the former is just an approximation of the latter.
however, this appears to be the case for a large class of solutions that saturate certain
sigma model energy bounds. this is probably due to supersymmetry which protects them
against higher derivative corrections. however, as we shall demonstrate, there are sigma
model solutions that do not saturate a bound which are also solutions of the full dbi action
without any modication.

1a eld is active in a solution, if it has a non-trivial dependence on the brane worldvolume coordinates.

2

a large class of (2+1)-dimensional sigma models are those with target spaces the com-
plex projective spaces cpn. since cpn is a kahler manifold, these sigma models admit a
supersymmetric extension with n = 2 supersymmetry in three dimensions (n = 1 super-
symmetry in four dimensions) and they are described by chiral superelds. the energy of
the static sigma model congurations is bounded by the topological central charge of the
supersymmetry algebra. the congurations that saturate this bound are solitons which
can be thought of as holomorphic curves in cpn. many of the properties of these soli-
tons have been extensively investigated, including their low energy scattering [8] as well
as soliton/anti-soliton annihilation using numerical and other methods [9]. another novel
class of solutions of cpn sigma models are those describing unstable soliton/anti-soliton
states which of course do not saturate the above bound [10, 11].

in this paper, we show that the cpn sigma model solitons, for n = 1, 2, 3, can be
described by iia d-brane congurations in nk  cpn, where nk = adsm  rp or nk =
r(1,k1). the backgrounds nk  cpn are solutions of iia supergravity theory which can
be most easily constructed from the near horizon geometry of the m-2-brane using kk
reduction or from the near horizon geometries of iib d-branes using type ii t-duality. the
compactication circle in all cases is the bre of the hopf bration of an odd-dimensional
sphere over a complex projective space. such kk-reductions and type ii dualities have been
investigated in [12]. we shall nd that if we appropriately place a iia d-brane in the above
iia backgrounds, then its dynamics is described by a dbi action with target space rkcpn,
for some k and n. such dbi actions admit an energy bound associated with kahler
calibrations. the congurations that saturate the bound are holomorphic submanifolds of
rkcpn. in particular, if we place a d-2-brane in the iia background which arises from the
m-2-brane the part of its dbi action which is quadratic in the derivatives of the elds can be
identied with a cp3 sigma model. the relevant kahler calibrations in this case are those
of degree two and the calibrated submanifolds can be identied with the cp3 solitons of the
(2+1)-dimensional sigma model. therefore the soliton solutions of the cp3 sigma model
are interpreted as wrapped d-2-branes on the holomorphic cycles of cp3. we shall also
identify the anti-solitons with wrapped d-2-branes on the anti-holomorphic cycles of cp3.
in addition, we shall show that the soliton/anti-soliton solutions of the cpn, n > 1, sigma
model are also solutions of the d-2-brane dbi action. these solutions saturate neither the
sigma model nor the kahler calibration bounds. we shall interpret these non-bps solutions
as d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane congurations or as a d-2-brane wrapped on a non-bps cycle
in cpn. we shall then explore these brane/anti-brane solutions in connection with the
recent developments on brane/anti-brane states in type ii string theory [13]. in particular,
we shall argue that in the d-2-brane sector the (1)fl operator of iia string theory that
exchanges d-branes and anti-d-branes should be identied with complex conjugation in
cp3 which exchanges solitons and anti-solitons. the d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane solutions
that are real, and so invariant under complex conjugation, do not exhibit any moduli which
allow the separation of the solitons from the anti-solitons. this is in agreement with the
properties of the (1)fl invariant d-brane/anti-d-brane states in string theory.
this paper has been organized as follows: in section two, we summarize briey some
of the properties of cpn sigma model solitons. in section three, we show that the cp3

3

sigma model solitons can be interpreted as wrapped d-2-branes on the homology cycles of
cp3. in section four, we demonstrate that the non-bps sigma model cp3 solitons can be
identied with d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane congurations. in section ve, we compare our
non bps d-brane solutions with those constructed in type ii string theory. in section six,
we investigate the dynamics of brane probes in other backgrounds that involve a complex
projective space.
in section seven, we compare the low energy dynamics of bps sigma
model solitons with that of the associated d-brane congurations and we nd that they
may dier.
in section eight, we investigate the brane interpretation of other non-bps
congurations and in section nine we give our conclusions.

2 the cpn sigma model

in this section we briey review some properties of the (2+1)-dimensional sigma model
with target space cpn (for more details see eg. [11]). for this, we begin with the description
a (2+1)-dimensional sigma model with target space any kahler manifold m equipped with
a metric h and compatible complex structure k. the sigma model elds are maps x from
r(1,2) into m. the energy of a static sigma model conguration (x : r2  m) is

e =

1

2 z d2xhij ijix ijx j

where i, j = 1, 2 and i, j = 1, . . . , dimm. then

e =

4 z d2x hij ij (ix i  k
2 z d2x (k)ij ijix ijx j ,

ik i

lkx l)(jx j  

jk j

m x m )

where  is the levi-civita tensor and k is the kahler form of k. so we nd

e  2|q|

where

q =

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

4 z d2x(k)ijijix ijx j

is the topological charge since k is a closed form. clearly, the congurations that saturate
the bound satisfy

ix i  k

ik i

jkx j = 0 .

(2.5)

this is the cauchy-riemann equation and the solutions are holomorphic curves in the
kahler manifold m.

the above bound (2.3) is a special case of a more general bound that can be constructed
for sigma models with elds that are maps x : n  r  m, where (n, m) are both kahler
manifolds of any dimension with metrics (g, h) and compatible complex structures (l, k),

4

respectively. the bound in this case is also saturated by holomorphic maps from n into
m;

ix i  lk

ik i

j kx j = 0 .

(2.6)

for m = cpn, the sigma model elds x can be parameterized2 by a complex (n + 1)-
component column vector u, of unit length ie. u u = 1. the sigma model lagrangian is
given by

(2.7)
where dv = v  (u u)v. greek indices run over the spacetime values 0,1,2 and
we use the minkowski metric  = (1, 1, 1). the sigma model equation of motion which
follows from (2.7) is
(2.8)

ddu + (du)(du)u = 0

l = (du)(du)

and all nite energy solutions are classied by the integer valued topological charge (2.4),
which in this parameterization is given by

q =

i

2 z d2x jk(dju)(dku) .

in this parameterization, the congurations that saturate the bound satisfy

the bps soliton solutions are easily constructed as

dju = ik

jdku.

u =

f
|f|

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

where f is any vector whose components are rational functions of the complex coordinate
z = x1 + ix2. the topological charge q is positive in this case and is equal to the highest
degree of the rational functions which occur in the entries of f . the anti-soliton solutions,
which have negative topological charge, are obtained in the same way but with f an anti-
holomorphic function of z.

there are also non-bps solutions, ie. solutions of the second order equations (2.8)
which are not solutions of the rst order equations (2.10), and therefore do not saturate
the energy bound [10, 11]. all these solutions can be obtained explicitly by making use of
the operator p+ acting on a general vector g as

the non-bps solutions are then given by a repeated application of this operator

p+g = zg  (gzg)

g

|g|2 .

spaces which we shall also employ later to construct the supergravity backgrounds.

starting with any initial holomorphic vector f. the operator p+ can only be applied n
times, since after this number of applications the original holomorphic vector is converted
into an anti-holomorphic vector and p+ annihilates anti-holomorphic vectors. thus this
operator converts bps solitons into bps anti-solitons, but intermediate solutions with
0 < k < n correspond to non-bps soliton/anti-soliton congurations. note that in the
case of the cp1 model the operator can be applied only once and converts bps soliton
solutions to bps anti-soliton solutions, so there are no non-bps solutions in this case.

3 d-branes in cpn

for the brane interpretation of the sigma model solitons of the previous section, we
have to nd string or m-theory vacua that involve cpn. the construction of such iia string
theory backgrounds is most easily done by kk-reducing from m-theory or t-dualizing from
iib strings of backgrounds with topology nk  s2n+1, where nk is a manifold which will
be specied later. the kk-reduction and t-duality are then performed along the circle
bre of the hopf bration

s1  s2n+1  cpn

(3.1)

of the sphere s2n+1 of the background. using this bration, the round metric on s2n+1 can
be written as

ds2(s2n+1) = v2(d + )2 + ds2(cpn)

(3.2)

where v is a constant3,  is the coordinate along s1, ds2(cpn) is the fubini-study metric
on cpn and

k =

d ;

(3.3)

k is the kahler form on cpn. such kk-reductions and t-dualities have been investigated
in [12]. here and in section ve, we shall summarize for completeness the construction of
these cpn geometries. then we shall describe the actions of d-brane probes propagating in
these iia backgrounds. we shall begin with the kk-reduction of m-theory backgrounds.
the construction of backgrounds using type ii duality will be described in section ve.

the simplest backgrounds that we can reduce from m-theory are those of the near
horizon geometries of m-2- and m-5-branes. in the latter case though, the background
involves an even-dimensional sphere and so only the m-2-brane case will be investigated.
the metric and four-form eld strength of the near horizon geometry ads4  s7 of the
m-2-brane are

g4 = dt  dx  dy  d

where {t, x, y} are coordinates in r(1,2) which can be identied with the m-2-brane world-
volume coordinates of the background, r is a radial coordinate and r is a constant. the
kk-reduction ansatz which leads from m-theory to type iia strings in the string frame is

(3.5)

where  is the dilaton, a is the kk vector potential, h3 is the nsns 3-form eld strength
and f4 is the 4-form rr eld strength. using (3.5) to reduce (3.4), we nd

(3.6)

where f2 is the kk two-form eld strength. observe that for this background the dilaton
is constant and that the nsns three-form eld strength h3 vanishes. the geometry
of this iia background is ads4  cp3 and the string coupling constant is gs = |rv|
2 .
since ads4  s7 preserves all bulk supersymmetry, it is expected that the same is true
for the ads4  cp3 background of type iia strings as reduction over a circle does not
break supersymmetry. for this, however, all perturbative and non-perturbative states of
type iia string theory should be included [12]. if only the perturbative type iia string
theory is considered or the iia supergravity limit is taken, then the iia solution appears
to preserve only a fraction of total bulk supersymmetry.

next, we place a d-2-brane in this background. the action that describes the dynamics
of such a d-2-brane can be consistently truncated by setting the born-infeld eld to zero.
this is because h3  0. the remaining action is

idbi = t2z [d3xeqdet() + ]

(3.7)

where t2 is the tension of the d-2-brane4,  is the induced metric on the brane world-
volume (,  = 0, 1, 2) and  is the electrostatic potential due to the pulling back of the
gauge potential c3 of the 4-form eld strength f4 = dc3, ie.  = x c3. substituting the
value of the dilaton for this background, we get

idbi = t2z [d3x

1

gsqdet() + ] .

(3.8)

next we place the d-2-brane parallel to the background at r = r0 with active scalars only
along cp3. this restriction is consistent because any constant value for the scalars solves

4the tension of a d-p-brane in string units is tp =

the dbi eld equations. in this case, the electrostatic potential  does not contribute
to the eld equations and the induced metric  on the d-2-brane worldvolume arises by
pulling back the spacetime metric

ds2 = |rv|[

r4
0
r4 ds2(r(1,2)) + r2ds2(cp3)] ,

(3.9)

which has geometry r(1,2)  cp3. to summarize, the action of such a d-2-brane probe is

idbi =

t2

gs z d3xqdet() ,

(3.10)

where  is the pull back of ds2 on the worldvolume. clearly the part of the action (3.10)
which is quadratic in the derivatives of the scalars in the static gauge can be identied
with the action of the cp3 sigma model described in the previous section, up to an overall
normalization factor. in addition, restricting the active scalars of the d-2-brane probe to
lie in the cp1 and cp2 submanifolds of cp3, we nd that the action (3.10) in the sigma
model approximation becomes a cpn sigma model for n = 1, 2, respectively.

as in the case of the cpn sigma models in the previous section, we shall seek static

solutions of this system. the energy5 of such solutions is

edbi =

t2|rv|

r2

r2 z d2xqdet(ij) ,

(3.11)

where ij is the pull back of the spatial part of the metric (3.9). the solutions that minimize
the energy are minimal surfaces in r2  cpn, for n = 1, 2, 3. since r2  cpn is a kahler
manifold, it is well known that there is a bound for the energy which is described by a
kahler calibration. in particular

where q is a topological charge induced by pulling back the kahler form

onto the d-2-brane worldvolume. the congurations that saturate the bound are holomor-
phic curves in r2 cpn. so we nd that the congurations that saturate the energy bound
of the sigma model also saturate the calibration bound for the energy of the d-2-brane
probe restricted in cpn.

from the established relation between sigma model cpn solitons and d-2-brane probes,
it is natural to interpret the sigma model solitons as d-2-branes wrapped on the homology
cycles of cpn. of course all these congurations have nite energy, since these cycles are
compact and so have nite volume. the bulk interpretation of the whole conguration is
more involved. this is due to the diculty of interpreting the background that we have

used within type iia strings. this background is not asymptotically at and so global
charges cannot be used to determined whether it can be interpreted as a superposition
of elementary branes. nevertheless, since the iia background is a reduction of the near
horizon geometry of the m-2-brane along a transverse direction, it is clear that the iia
conguration is the near horizon geometry of a d-2-brane. however this is not all since
the iia background also contains a non-vanishing magnetic kk two-form eld strength f2.
this is characteristic of the presence of d-6-branes. but f2 has support in all cp3 and so
it cannot be due to a single d-6-brane or a parallel superposition of them. now assuming
that the background consists of a single d-2-brane then the probe due to a sigma model
soliton is another orthogonal d-2-brane wrapped on a cycle of cp3. the two d-2-branes do
not intersect because they are separated by the coordinate r. the background d-2-brane
is located at r = 0 whereas the probe is located at r = r0. the limit r0  0 appears to
be singular. for example, the energy of the probe vanishes in this limit. we remark that
there is a ux through the cycle that the d-2-brane wraps which is induced by pulling back
on the worldvolume the kk two-form eld strength.

it remains to investigate the supersymmetry preserved by the d-2-brane solutions.
for this one has to use the bulk supersymmetry conditions for the background and the
supersymmetry conditions that are associated with the dbi action. however as we have
mentioned there are diculties in computing the fraction of supersymmetry preserved
by the iia background above within iia supergravity. this does not allow us to do a
direct computation. the expectation is that the d-2-brane solution will preserve 1/2
of the supersymmetry that the background preserves. a similar situation arises for the
backgrounds of section six.

4 non-bps d-2-branes

we shall now nd that, remarkably, the non-bps sigma model solitons have a d-brane
interpretation. for this we shall show that the non-bps sigma model solitons are also
solutions of the dbi eld equations. although, for applications to d-branes we have to
restrict the target space cpn to n = 1, 2, 3, our proof can be extended to any n. to prove
this we begin by computing the dbi eld equations for static congurations that follow
from the variation of (3.10).
in terms of the u parameterization the lagrangian, after
appropriate rescaling of the worldvolume coordinates, becomes

after a little algebra we nd that the static eld equations are

ldbi = qdet( + (du)(du) + (du)(du))  1 .
(diu )[1 + 2(dj u )(dj u )]  (dj u )[(diu )(dj u ) + (dj u )(diu )]

= 
q1 + 2(dlu )(dlu )[1 + (dku )(dku )]  (dlu )(dku )[(dlu )(dku ) + (dku )(dlu )]

(4.2)

it is convenient to introduce the notation tij  (diu)(dju) and rewrite equation (4.2)
in the form

d1{

d2{

(d1u)(1 + 2t22)  (d2u)(t12 + t21)
q1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2} +
(d2u)(1 + 2t11)  (d1u)(t12 + t21)
q1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2} +
u[t11 + t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2]
q1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2

= 0.

next we observe that if we impose the following constraints

then equations (4.3) can be simplied to

t11 = t22, t12 = t21

d1d1u + d2d2u + u(t11 + t22) = 0

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

which are exactly the sigma model eld equations for static congurations (2.8). thus if
we can nd static solutions of the sigma model equations which also satisfy the constraints
(4.4) then they will also be static solutions of the dbi equations. the bps solitons solve the
equations (2.10) and so automatically obey the constraints (4.4) (and have the additional
property that t12 = it11). we shall now show that the sigma model non-bps solitons
also satisfy the constraints.
in terms of the complex variable z = x1 + ix2 the pair of real equations (4.4) can be

written as the single complex equation

(dzu)(dzu) = 0.

(4.6)

from the denition of p+, given by (2.12), the following properties may be proved (see eg.
[11]) when f is a holomorphic vector,

(p k

+f ) p l

+f = 0,

z(cid:16)p k

+f(cid:17) = p k1

,

z  p k1
+ f|2! =
+ f
|p k1

p k

|p k1
+ f|2

.

(4.7)

(4.8)

using these properties it is elementary to show that if u is a non-bps solution given by
(2.13) then

.

(4.9)

dzu =

p k+1
+ f
|p k
+f|

, dzu = p k1

+ f |p k
+f|
|p k1
+ f|2

hence equation (4.6) follows immediately from the orthogonality property (4.7). this
completes the proof that the non-bps solitons are also solutions of the dbi model.

10

these non-bps solutions have the interpretation of d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane states in
analogy with their corresponding soliton/anti-soliton interpretation in sigma models. the
global properties of these solutions as submanifolds of cpn have been investigated in [14].
these non-bps solutions can also be viewed as a d-brane wrapped on a non-bps cycle in
cpn.

the reader may wonder if it is possible to see why the non-bps solitons solve the
dbi equations directly from the lagrangian. of course, in general it is inconsistent to
substitute constraints in the lagrangian since the critical points of the constrained system
are generally not critical points of the full theory. for bps solitons this is not a concern
because they saturate the energy bound and so are automatically critical points.
it is
therefore enough to show that the dbi lagrangian reduces to the sigma model lagrangian
when the bps constraints are imposed. however, non-bps solutions require a little more
thought.

as we want to investigate when the dbi lagrangian (or equivalently energy density
since we are dealing with the static sector) reduces to that of the sigma model then we
compute that

(1 + e)2  (1 + edbi)2

= (1 + t11 + t22)2  (1 + 2t11 + 2t22 + 4t11t22  (t12 + t21)2)
= (t11  t22)2 + (t12 + t21)2.

(4.10)

in the nal line we recognize the constraints (4.4) and there are two crucial points to
be noted. the dbi energy density is identical to that of the sigma model if and only if
the constraints (4.4) hold. the rst point is that these constraints are weaker than the
bps equations and have more solutions, in particular we have shown that the non-bps
solitons satisfy the constraints. the second point is that the above expression is quadratic
in the constraints, so its variation is proportional to the constraints and vanishes after their
imposition. this explains why the critical points of the constrained system, which is the
sigma model, are also critical points of the full dbi theory.

5 comparison with string theory

as we have seen, the sigma model cp3 (anti-) solitons can be identied with (anti-)
d-2-branes. this allows us to relate some of the properties of the non-bps cp3 sigma
model solitons to those of the non-bps d-branes that have been constructed in string
theory [13]. we shall mainly discuss the case of d-2-branes (for a review on d-branes in
string theory see [15]). in iia string theory, one begins with a d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane
pair. then it is observed that the (1)fl operator, which changes the sign of the rr eld
strengths, maps d-branes to anti-d-branes. so the d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane pair remains
invariant under (1)fl. since iia/(1)fl can be identied with iib string theory, the d-
2-brane/anti-d-2-brane pair becomes a new (unstable) non-bps state of iib string theory.
one of the properties of this state is that there are no moduli which separate the d-2-brane
from the anti-d-2-brane. this construction of course can be repeated for all d-branes.

11

to compare the non-bps states in string theory with our non-bps solitons, one has to
identify the (1)fl operator in our context. one choice that has the desirable property of
taking d-2-brane solitons to anti-d-2-brane solitons is complex conjugation. one potential
diculty with this is that the background that we are using for the iia strings is not nec-
essarily a solution of iib strings. so it is not clear how the identication iia/(1)fl =iib
will work in this case. another diculty is that in our construction of soliton/anti-soliton
states, we did not take into account the string tachyon. the iia tachyon t is a complex
scalar for the d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane case with a potential v (|t|). so to make a connec-
tion between the sigma model results and those of string theory, we may take the tachyon
t to take a constant value at the minimum of the potential.

despite these diculties, we shall give an example which demonstrates that some of the
properties of the non-bps solitons are related to those of non-bps d-branes of string the-
ory. in particular, we shall nd that for the real ( (1)fl invariant) non-bps soliton/anti-
soliton states there are no moduli that separate the soliton from the anti-soliton. to
illustrate this we shall consider solitons that have active scalars which take values in a
totally geodesic cp2 submanifold of cp3. let (e, q) denote the energy e (in units of 2)
and the charge q of the sigma model solutions. the rst observation is that there are
no non-bps (e, q) = (2, 0) solutions in cp2, ie. there are no non-bps states which are
made of a single d-2-brane and a single anti-d-2-brane6. so let us begin with a (2, 2) bps
soliton. a simple case is that of an axially symmetric one with

f = 


i(1 + z2)

1  z2
2z




.

(5.1)

the energy density of this soliton is localized in the neighbourhood of a point and so it
should be thought of as a single soliton of charge two. acting with the p+ operator, we
nd a non-bps (4, 0) solution for which

p+f = 2

1 + |z|2 


z + z
i(z  z)
1  |z|2




.

(5.2)

this solution has the interpretation as a d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane state with the d-branes
and anti-d-branes having charges 2 and 2, respectively. the solution (5.2) is real, and
so (1)fl invariant, and its energy density is localized in the neighbourhood of a point.
so the d-2-brane and the anti-d-2-brane are located at the same region with no moduli to
separate them. this is what is expected for a non-bps (1)fl state in string theory.
to proceed let us introduce a real moduli parameter b in the bps (2, 2) soliton as

6it would be of interest to nd a string theoretic derivation of this.

1 + b  z2
i(1 + z2)

2z

12

fb = 





.

(5.3)

if b = 0, then fb = f and the bps soliton reduces to the one we have investigated above.
for b 6= 0, the energy of the solution is not localized at the neighbourhood of a point and so
b should be thought of as a moduli parameter that controls the separation of the solitons.
next we nd that the non-bps (4, 0) solution associated with fb is

p+fb =

. (5.4)

2(1 + |z|2)2 + b(2  z2  z2 + b) 


2

2(1 + |z|2)(z + z) + b(z + 2z + zz2
2i(1 + |z|2)(z  z) + ibz(3  z2 + b)
2(1  |z|4) + b(2 + z2  z2 + b)




this solution again has the interpretation of a d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane state with the
d-2-brane and the anti-d-2-brane having charges 2 and 2, respectively. however, the
energy density of this solution is not localized at the neighbourhood of a point, if b 6= 0.
so b can again be thought of as a moduli parameter that measures the soliton and anti-
soliton separation. the solution (5.4) is not real. it turns out that if we enforce the reality
condition on the solution, and so the (1)fl invariance, then b = 0 and the solution reduces
to that in (5.2). this example illustrates that the real ((1)fl invariant) non-bps sigma
model solutions do not have moduli that separate the solitons from the anti-solitons. it can
be seen that in general there are no moduli to separate the solitons from the anti-solitons
in a real solution, because for a real solution not only is the charge q zero but the charge
density is identically zero, which implies that the solitons and anti-solitons are located
at the same point. this is in agreement with the results in string theory for the (1)fl
invariant d-brane/anti-d-brane states.

6 d-branes in other backgrounds

another class of backgrounds that involve cpn can be constructed by using type ii
t-duality on the near horizon geometry of type ii p-branes. the near horizon geometry of
a d-p-brane is

where fp+2 for p > 3 is the magnetic dual of the standard supergravity (8-p)-form rr
eld strength f8p and fp+2 for p = 3 should be projected to its self-dual part. since
only odd-dimensional spheres are hopf brations over projective spaces, backgrounds that
involve cpn can be constructed by t-dualizing type iib d-branes along the hopf bre.
for p < 7. let d, c (2)

the iib d-brane background above, we nd the iia background8 (after dropping the tildes

it is expected that this iia background contains a iia d-(p+1)-brane, since the t-duality
is performed in a direction transverse to the iib d-p-brane. however, (6.3) has also a non-
vanishing nsns three-form eld strength h3. this in fact is the main dierence between
the iia background investigated in section three and the backgrounds that arise from the
type ii t-duality above. because of this, the born-infeld eld f of a d-brane probe cannot
be set consistently to zero. the action of a d-(p+1)-brane probe placed in the background
(6.3) includes wess-zumino type terms [17] and it can be written as

i = tp+1z [dp+2x eqdet( + f) + ef xk

(6.4)

back of the spacetime metric g onto the worldvolume. in the action (6.4) only the degree

f = 2f + b ,

8for a discussion of the supersymmetry preserved by these backgrounds see [12].
9we use the same symbols b, c to denote both the gauge potentials of the form-eld strengths associated
with the background and their pull backs on the worldvolume. of course in the d-brane actions, the pull
backs of b and c occur.

(h = db) and m is the inverse of m.

as for the backgrounds investigated in section three, we place a iia d-(p+1)-brane in
the background (6.3) in such a way that its dynamics is determined only by active scalars.
the additional diculty in this case is that the above backgrounds exhibit a non-vanishing
nsns three-form eld strength. to proceed, we rst place the d-(p+1)-brane at r = r0
and  = 0. this eliminates the contribution from the rr (p+2)-form gauge potential
and h3|=0 = 0. however, b need not vanish. in particular, it can be arranged such that
b|=0 = 0k which is not zero. but since h3|=0 = db|=0 = 0, we can eliminate the
contribution from b|=0 by switching on a non-vanishing bi eld f and setting

 2f = b|=0 .

so far we have constructed type iia string backgrounds that involve complex projective
spaces. it is also possible to construct type iib string backgrounds that involve cpn. this
can be achieved by again t-dualizing the iia backgrounds that we have found in (6.3).
however this time the t-duality is performed along one of the spatial coordinates in r(1,p).
the resulting iib conguration is

where z = xp. the relation between sigma model solitons and d-brane conguration can
be easily established in this case in a way similar to the one described above for the type

it remains to t-dualize the type ii ns-5-brane background. the t-duality rules for

backgrounds that contain only nsns elds are

of course these rules are symmetric between iia and iib. the near horizon geometry of
the ns-5-brane background is

where (s3) is the volume form of s3. observe that in terms of the hopf bration of s3,
(s3) = |v|d  (s2) where (s2) is the volume form of s2. applying the t-duality rules
above for this background, we nd after dropping the tildes from the elds that

(6.16)

where  = r2|v|1. so after an appropriate periodic identication of , the near horizon
geometry of the ns-5-brane is self-dual under t-duality in the  direction provided that
r = 1 (|v| = 1). in this case, there is no straightforward way to place a ns-5-brane or
a d-brane probe in this background such that its eective action reduces to a dirac one.
the choice  = 0 is not appropriate because the induced metric on the worldvolume is not
invariant under the gauge transformations of the hopf bration of s3 over s2. it is clear
that in this case to nd static solutions, we have to use generalized calibrations. it would
be of interest to compare the worldvolume solutions arising from generalized calibrations
and the solitons of the associated sigma models with a wess-zumino term.

the above backgrounds do not exhaust all possibilities. there are very many dierent
backgrounds which may involve a complex projective space. the most obvious class of
candidates is that of backgrounds with the interpretation of intersecting branes. the near
horizon geometries of some of these congurations involve odd-dimensional spheres. so one
can use t-duality or kk-reduction along the ber of the hopf bration of these spheres
to induce a complex projective space in the dual picture. then one can proceed to place
brane probes in these backgrounds and establish bounds for the energy in a way similar to
the one we have explained above.

7 sigma model soliton vs d-brane dynamics

as we have seen, some of the sigma model bps solitons have a d-brane interpretation by
solving the dbi eld equations. it is therefore natural to compare the dynamics of slowly
moving bps solitons in the sigma models and that of the associated d-brane congurations
in dbi, using the moduli space approximation [18]. naively it might be expected that the
low energy dynamics of bps solutions in the two theories will be the same since they
have the same low energy limit. however, the agreement of the two lagrangians is to
quadratic order in all the derivatives of the elds ie. space and time, whereas the moduli
space approximation assumes that time derivatives are small but there is no truncation
of the spatial derivatives. thus it is not clear whether the dynamics of d-branes in the
dbi theory will match that of the sigma model solitons. the moduli space of sigma model
solitons is a kahler manifold [19].

the moduli space approximation truncates the full eld dynamics to motion on the
bps soliton moduli space. applying the bps soliton equation (2.10) the dbi lagrangian
(3.10) can be written as

ldbi = q(1 + 2t11)(1 + 2t11  2t00  4(t11t00  t01t10))  1

(7.1)

where the notation is as in section four. expanding out the square root and neglecting
terms which are higher order than quadratic in the time derivatives, we obtain, after the
integration over space

ldbi = 2|q| z d2x(t00 + 2(t11t00  t01t10)) .

(7.2)

17

the rst term is just the potential energy of a charge q soliton and the remaining term
denes a metric on the q-soliton moduli space, with respect to which the dynamics is
approximated by geodesic motion. the rst term in the integrand is the kinetic energy of
the sigma model, thus the metric on the moduli space of d-brane solitons will be equal to
that of the sigma model solitons if and only if the term (which we now write out in full)

k  2z {(d1u)(d1u)(d0u)(d0u)  (d0u)(d1u)(d1u)(d0u)} d2x

(7.3)

vanishes or is equal to a total time derivative.

for the cp1 model this term is indeed zero. the easiest way to see this is to choose
the parameterization (which can be done without loss of generality using the local u(1)
symmetry)

in terms of which it is easily found that

u =

1

q1 + |w|2 (cid:18) 1
w(cid:19)
(1 + |w|2)3/2 (cid:18) w
1 (cid:19) .

w

du =

thus d0u is proportional to d1u and hence the integrand in (7.3) is identically zero.
however, this cancellation is a unique property of the cp1 case and derives from the fact
that it has only one (complex) eld.

to demonstrate that in the cpn model with n > 1 the term (7.3) can be non-zero it is
enough to consider the cp2 case (since cp2 is a totally geodesic submanifold of cpn for
n > 2). writing the cp2 eld as

(7.4)

(7.5)

(7.6)

(7.7)

then

1

u =

w1
w2


q1 + |w1|2 + |w2|2 


k = z 2|0w1zw2  0w2zw1|2
(1 + |w1|2 + |w2|2)3

d2x.

if either w1 or w2 are identically zero then this term vanishes, corresponding to the em-
bedding of cp1 inside cp2, but generally (7.7) is non-zero. finally, we need to check that
this term is not a total time derivative, otherwise it would not contribute to the geodesic
equations. the easiest way to show this is by a simple example.

an axially symmetric cp2 d-brane soliton of charge q has the form

w1 = zq  , w2 = zq + 

(7.8)

where  and  are complex parameters related to the size and shape of the soliton [21].
taking  and  to be time dependent the integrand in (7.7) is axially symmetric and the
integration is elementary to arrive at

k =

2q|0|2
(1 + 2||2)2
18

(7.9)

which is clearly not a total time derivative.

one expects that the cpn d-branes for n > 1 break more supersymmetry10 than those
in cp1. because of this, the above observation regarding the low energy dynamics of
solitons, is related to a similar observation in [20] that the small perturbations around
supersymmetric d-brane solitons that preserve less than 1/4 of the maximal spacetime
supersymmetry in the maxwell theory-sigma model approximation of the dbi action do
not solve the perturbed dbi eld equations. however if the solutions preserve 1/4 of
spacetime supersymmetry, then the perturbations of the maxwell theory-sigma model
approximation also solve the perturbed dbi eld equations. this indicates that for bps
solitons which preserve enough supersymmetry, supersymmetry protects the sigma model
soliton moduli metric from higher derivative corrections.

in summary we have shown that for cp1 the slow motion dynamics of d-brane solitons
is identical to that of the sigma model solitons, but for n > 1 the dynamics of slowly
moving d-branes in cpn is dierent from that of the sigma model solitons. this is despite
the fact that the low energy truncation of the dbi lagrangian gives the sigma model one
and that the bps solutions of the two systems are the same.

8 non-bps born-infeld field congurations

the investigation of the relation between bps and non-bps solutions of dbi theory
and those of sigma models, that we have described, can be extended to include the relation
between bps and non-bps solutions of dbi theory and those of yang-mills coupled to
matter systems. recently su(n) monopole solutions have been constructed which solve the
second order yang-mills-higgs equations but are not solutions of the rst order bogomolny
equations. not only are these solutions three-dimensional analogues of the non-bps cpn1
sigma model solutions but in fact the sigma model solutions are used explicitly to obtain the
monopoles [22]. an obvious candidate in the search for non-bps dbi solitons is therefore
to consider a system of n parallel d3-branes in type iib string theory, since its low energy
truncation reproduces the yang-mills-higgs lagrangian. however, we shall make a simple
observation that suggests that the non-bogomolny yang-mills-higgs monopoles will not
be solutions of the dbi equations in this case. this in fact may not be a surprise. for
example, in [23] it has been observed that even some bps solutions of yang-mills theory
do not solve the born-infeld eld equations.

although the eective action of a single d3-brane in type iib string theory is described
by an abelian dbi lagrangian a system of n parallel d3-branes is expected to be described
by a u(n) dbi theory, the most promising of which is the proposal of tseytlin [24]. in the
static case, with one active adjoint scalar, the energy density of the d3-brane worldvolume
theory can be conveniently written as [25]

10we remark that the corresponding sigma model solitons always break half of the supersymmetry of

ebi = str(qdet(ab + fab)  1)

(8.1)

the n = 2 (2+1)-dimensional sigma model.

19

where a, b go from 1 to 4 and a dimensional reduction is performed in the x4 direction
with the usual identication of the scalar eld as  = a4. the gauge group is su(n) (an
overall u(1) factor decouples as the centre of mass) and str denotes the trace over gauge
indices of the weighted sum over all permutations of the non-commutative products [24].
this is required in order to make sense of the ordering ambiguities involved in computing
the determinant.

(8.3)

are also solutions of the born-infeld theory (8.1), which can be shown by noting that the
two energies (8.1) and (8.2) are equal upon substitution of the bogomolny equation [25, 26].
the charge k monopole solution describes k d-strings stretched between the n d3-branes
and this can be seen explicitly by graphing the eigenvalues of the scalar eld  over r3
[25].

in order to determine whether the non-bogomolny monopole solutions [22] of (8.2) are
solutions of the born-infeld theory we follow the procedure given in (4.10) for the sigma
model case, and compute when the yang-mills-higgs and dirac-born-infeld energies agree.
ignoring the trace operation and treating the matrices as if they were abelian (which can
be justied using the symmetrized trace [25, 26]) we compute that

2[(1 + ey m h)2  (1 + ebi)2] = (d2d3 + f12f13)2 + (d1d3 + f21f23)2

(8.4)

as in the sigma model case, (4.10), we nd that the result can again be written as a sum of
squares, but this time there is an important dierence in that the constraints (under which
the two energies agree) now contain the bogomolny equations (8.3) explicitly (see the last
three terms). thus in this case, in contrast to the sigma model example, the constraints
are solved only by the bogomolny monopoles. although this does not prove that the non-
bogomolny monopoles do not solve the born-infeld theory, it strongly suggests that they
do not and certainly shows that the feature of non-bps solitons in the sigma model does
not apply in the same way to this example.

20

9 concluding remarks

we have shown that the cpn sigma model bps solitons can be identied with d-2-
branes wrapped on holomorphic homology cycles of cpn. for this, we have used the fact
that cpn for n = 1, 2, 3 occurs in certain supergravity backgrounds and we have found that
the sigma model solitons also solve the eld equations of a dirac-born-infeld action of some
brane probes in these backgrounds. we have also shown that certain non-bps cpn sigma
model solutions are also solutions of dirac-born-infeld actions and so they are interpreted
as d-branes wrapped on non-holomorphic cycles in cpn. we have compared the properties
of the d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane solutions that we have constructed with those expected
for the d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane states constructed by sen in string theory. we have
found that the (1)fl d-2-brane/anti-d-2-brane solutions do not exhibit moduli which
allow the separation of the d-2-branes from the anti-d-2-branes, in agreement with the
results in string theory. we have also investigated the dynamics of solitons and that of
the associated d-branes. we have found that the latter does not coincide with the former
unless n = 1. we have also explored the relation between other non-bps solutions in
yang-mills theories with certain brane congurations.

our results can be easily extended for the backgrounds considered in [12]. these are
constructed by reducing and t-dualizing the m-2-brane and the d-brane solutions of su-
pergravity for which the associated harmonic functions have one pole, respectively. the
solutions that we nd in this case for the brane probes are the same as those we have
constructed for the associated near horizon geometries. another direction to extend our
results is to consider sigma models with target spaces g/h manifolds which are not nec-
essarily complex projective spaces. an obvious class of such g/h spaces is the one that
appears in the ads4  g/h and ads7  g/h compactications of m-theory as well as
other similar compactications of string theory. in addition we can superpose ads4g/h
and ads7  g/h with a membrane and with a m-5-brane, respectively, and similarly for
the analogous string compactications.
it would be of interest to investigate the bps
(and non-bps) solitons of such sigma models and then compare them with the solutions
that arise from (generalized) calibrations in these backgrounds. this will lead to a better
understanding of the properties of branes in these backgrounds.
