in order to study vertex operators for the type iib superstring on ads space, we derive
supersymmetric constraint equations for the vertex operators in ads3  s3 backgrounds
with ramond-ramond ux, using berkovits-vafa-witten variables. these constraints are

solved to compute the vertex operators and show that they satisfy the linearized d = 6,

n = (2, 0) equations of motion for a supergravity and tensor multiplet expanded around
the ads3  s3 spacetime.

1. introduction

the formulation of compactied string theories on anti de sitter (ads) backgrounds is

necessary to understand the conjectured dualities with spacetime conformal eld theories

(cfts). presently, calculations using the correspondence are restricted to the supergravity

limit of the string theories. this is because of the appearance of background ramond-

ramond elds in the string worldsheet action, which makes understanding the worldsheet

cfts dicult.

this problem has been partly overcome in some special cases. for example, the
berkovits-vafa formalism for supersymmetric quantization on r6  m (where m is k3 or
t4) [1,2,3] uses the following worldsheet elds. in addition to bosonic elds xp(z, z) that
contain both left- and right-moving modes, there are left-moving fermi elds a

l(z)
of spins 0 and 1, together with ghosts l(z), l(z), and right-moving counterparts of all

l(z), pa

these left-moving elds. the virtue of this formalism is that ramond-ramond background

a

elds can be incorporated without adding spin elds to the worldsheet action.
in the
ads3  s3 case, after adding those backgrounds it becomes convenient [4] to integrate
out the ps, giving a model in which the elds are xp, a, 
(all now with both left- and
a
right-moving components) as well as the ghosts. xp, a, and 
can be combined together
as coordinates on a supergroup manifold p su (2|2).1 the model is thus a sigma model
with that supergroup as a target, coupled also to the ghosts  and . the spacetime
supersymmetry group is p su (2|2)  p su (2|2), acting by left and right multiplication on
the p su (2|2) manifold, that is, by g  agb1 where g is a p su (2|2)-valued eld (which
combines x, , and ), and a, b  p su (2|2) are the symmetry group elements.

thus one arrives [4] at a sigma model with conventional local interactions (no spin

elds in the lagrangian) that gives a conformal eld theory description of strings propa-
gating on ads3  s3, with manifest spacetime supersymmetry. this gives a framework
for studying the type iib superstring on ads3  s3  m , and the model can in principle
be used to go beyond the supergravity approximation and compute the  expansion of
correlation functions.

in this paper, we analyze the vertex operators for this model for the massless states

that are independent of the details of the compactication (including the supergravity
multiplet). we work to leading order in , but because of the high degree of symmetry

1 p su (2|2) is the projectivization of su (2|2), obtained by dividing by its center, which is

u (1). p su (2|2) has been called su (2|2) in [4].

1

of the model, it seems very likely that the result is exact. concretely, we look for vertex

operators that are constructed from a function of the group-valued elds g together with

the ghosts ,  (but with no dependence on derivatives of the elds). the motivation for

this assumption is that it holds in the at case, according to [1].

the discussion is organized as follows.

in sect. 2, we write the string constraints
and nd an explicit description of the action of the p su (2|2)2 generators on the vertex
operators. we construct the constraint equations for the vertex operators in terms of these

charges, by requiring the equations to be a smooth deformation of the known at space

case and to be invariant under the ads supersymmetry transformations. in sect. 3, we

discuss how the gauge transformations of the vertex operator equations distinguish the

physical degrees of freedom. in sect. 4 we evaluate the constraints, using the dierential

geometry of the group manifold. in sect. 5, we compute the linearized ads supergravity

equations and match the vertex operator eld components to the supergravity elds of

general relativity.

2. string constraints

preliminaries on p su (2|2)

the bosonic part of the lie algebra of p su (2|2) is the su (2)  su (2) or so(4) lie
algebra. 2 the generators tab = tba of su (2)  su (2) transform as an antisymmetric
rank two tensor of su (2)  su (2) = so(4). (here a, b = 1, . . . , 4 are vector indices of
so(4).) the fermionic generators ea and f a transform as vectors of so(4). the lie

superalgebra takes the form

[tab, tcd] = ac tbd + bd tac  ad tbc  bc tad

[tab, fc] = acfbbcfa ,

[tab, ec] = aceb  bcea ,

{ea, fb} = 1

2 abcd tcd

(2.1)

{ea, eb} = {fa, fb} = 0 .

on the p su (2|2) manifold, we introduce bosonic and fermionic coordinates xp, p =

1 . . . 6 and a, 

a

, a = 1 . . . 4. we write a generic p su (2|2) element as

g = exp(afa)h exp(

b

eb),

with h  su (2)  su (2). when we want an explicit parametrization for h, we write

h = exp( 1

2 pcdxptcd),

(2.2)

(2.3)

where the pcd are described in appendix a. the idea here is that in the almost at limit
in which ads3  s3 reduces to minkowski space r6, the xp become standard minkowski
coordinates. in this limit, the su (2)  su (2) is extended to so(6) = su (4), with the p
index of xp transforming as a vector of so(6), and indices a, b, c transforming as a positive

chirality spinor of so(6) (a, b, c transform as an so(6) spinor of the same chirality since
we compactify the type iib superstring on ads3  s3  m ). we will write ea, fa, and
kab for the operators that represent the left action of ea, fa, and tab on g. very concretely,

in the above coordinates,

fa =

d
da ,
2 abcd b (tcd

kab = a

.

(2.4)

ea = 1

2 for ads3  s3, we really want the real form to be su (2)  sl(2, r), but for our formal

discussion we will just take the real form to be su (2)  su (2).

3

these formulas are found by asking for fag = fag, eag = eag, kabg = tabg. also, we
have introduced an operator tl that generates the left action of su (2) su (2) on h alone,
without acting on the s. we will also use an analogous tr that acts on h alone, on the
right. explicitly

tlab g = eafa (tab) h(x) e

a

ea ,

trab g = eafa h(x) tab e

where

g = g(x,  , ) = eafa e

ea = eafa h(x) e

(2.5)

(2.6)

in other words, in the parametrization of p su (2|2) in terms of h, , and , tl and tr
generate the left and right su (2)  su (2) action on h, leaving  and  xed.

the use of barred and unbarred indices in the above formulas is to be understood as

follows. like any group manifold, the so(4) manifold admits a left-invariant vielbein and

also a right-invariant vielbein. if we write m, n, p for a tangent space index, a, b, c for a

local lorentz index in the right-invariant vielbein, and a, b, c for a local lorentz index in

the left-invariant vielbein, then one might write the right- and left-invariant vielbeins as
m and ea
ea
m, respectively. however, because at every point on the so(4) manifold, there is
a distinguished so(4) subgroup of the tangent space group so(6) (namely the subgroup

that leaves xed the given point), we use an so(4) notation: we write a single local lorentz

index a in the vector of so(6) (or second rank antisymmetric tensor of so(4)) as ab (with

antisymmetry in a and b understood). likewise, a is replaced by ab. the right- and left-
invariant vielbeins are then written as ab
m , respectively. so(4) indices can be
raised or lowered as always with the invariant metric tensor ab of so(4). in short, indices
a, b, c are local lorentz indices for the right-invariant framing transforming as spinors of

m and ab

so(6), or vectors of so(4); and a, b, c are the same for the left-invariant framing. in (2.4),
hab is the so(4) group element in the vector representation. it carries one index of each
kind. it is orthogonal  that is, haa = h1

aa  and is acted on very simply by tl and tr:

haa tcd

ab = ac d

(2.7)

we call the generators of the right action of p su (2|2) on itself kab, ea, and f a. just

(2.9)

indices with bars are related to those without bars through the so(4) group element haa

by

ga = h b

a gb = hb

(2.10)

one of the most important objects in p su (2|2) group theory is the quadratic casimir
operator faea + 1
8 abcdtabtcd. as an operator on the p su (2|2) manifold, the quadratic
casimir is a second order dierential operator (since the group generators are rst order

operators); we will call it the laplacian. the laplacian can be written in terms of either

left or right generators as

fa ea + 1

(2.11)

in verifying these formulas, one uses the fact that the so(4) laplacian can similarly
be written in terms of left or right generators: 1
r . it follows
from the action of the generators given in (2.8) that f a, ea, kab also obey the p su (2|2)
commutation relations and that the laplacian (2.11) commutes with the group generators

(2.4), (2.8).

we recall nally that p su (2|2) has an sl(2, r) group of outer automorphisms with

e, f transforming as a doublet. in particular, the substitution

f a = ea , ea = f a , k

ab = k ab

(2.12)

leaves the laplacian and the commutation relations invariant.

form of vertex operators

we now want to construct the vertex operators for the supergravity multiplet.

in

this, we are guided by comparison with the at space case [1,4].

in the at case, the

supergravity vertex operators are constructed by acting with some n = 4 generators on

a spin zero eld v (x, , ;  + i,  + i) that is a function of these elds but not their

derivatives. v also obeys certain additional constraints.

the spin zero property is ensured by having v annihilated by the laplacian pp.
the laplacian is a second order dierential operator that is invariant under the poincare

5

symmetries. the analogous invariant second order operator on the p su (2|2) manifold is
the quadratic casimir operator that was introduced above.

the ghost elds  and  enter only in the combinations  + i and its barred counter-

part because these combinations have zero background charge and so do not contribute to

the dimension of the operator. also, these are the combinations that remain holomorphic
after perturbing to ads3  s3 as in [4].

finally, the constraint equations in the at space case, as presented in [1,4], are written
in terms of ab = pab/xp and a = /a. in the curved case, ab is deformed to k ab
and a is interpreted as fa. to the at space constraint equations, we nd that we have
to add lower order terms to achieve p su (2|2) invariance.

the expansion of the vertex operator in terms of the ghost elds is

v =


x

m,n=

em(i+)+n(i+) vm,n(x, , ) .

(2.13)

in at space, the constraints from the left and right-moving worldsheet super virasoro

algebras are from [4]:

()4v1,n = a babv1,n = 0

(2.15)

(2.16)

for 1  m, n  1, with the notation a = d/da, a = d/d
at space, these equations were derived by requiring the vertex operators to satisfy the

where tn, gn , gn , jn, jn and corresponding barred generators are the left and right

the type ii superstring [1,2,4]. the conditions (2.17) further implied vm,n = 0 for m > 1

or n > 1 or m < 1 or n < 1, leaving nine non-zero components.

in curved space, we modify these equations as follows:

( fa ea + 1

8 abcd k ab k cd ) vn,m = ( f a ea + 1

8 abcd k

ab

k cd ) vn,m = 0 .

(2.20)

equations (2.18)-(2.20) have been derived by deforming the corresponding equations for
the at case, which were presented above, by requiring invariance under the p su (2|2)
transformations that we will present momentarily. for example, in the second equation in
(2.18), the terms on the right hand side that are linear in p su (2|2) generators are curvature
corrections to the at equations, while the quadratic and cubic terms are present in the

at case.

the above constraint equations are invariant under the action of p su (2|2) 
p su (2|2), but there is a subtlety in how p su (2|2) acts. the subtlety comes from the
unusual form of the p su (2|2)  p su (2|2) currents found in [4] (and ultimately from the
unusual form of half of the supercharges even in the at case in this formalism [1]). while

f and k have natural denitions in [4], and act by the obvious left multiplication on g

while leaving invariant the ghosts, this is not true for e. rather, e has a term that acts
naturally on g, plus corrections that are proportional to ei times f .

we have found that the following transformations generate a p su (2|2) action on the

v s that commutes with the constraint equations in (2.18)- (2.20):

a vm,n = fa vm,n , ab vm,n = kab vm,n

+

a v1,n = ea v1,n , +

a v0,n = ea v0,n + ifav1,n , +

a v1,n = ea v1,n  ifav0,n .
(2.21)

7

(in a hopefully obvious notation, we write ab for the variation of the vertex operator
generated by tab and a for the variations generated by ea and fa.) these formulas
are the standard p su (2|2) generators on the vm,n, except that to e we have added a
multiple of f times a raising operator on the m index. this is suggested by the form
of the supercharges qa in [4]. the constraint equations in (2.18)-(2.20) were determined
by being invariant under the deformed p su (2|2) generators. this uniquely xed all the
it would be desireable to
lower order terms that were not present in the at case.

derive (2.18)-(2.20) directly by constructing the constraint operators and their action on
vertex functions exactly, or at least perturbatively in . however, the uniqueness gives us

condence in the formulas.

3. gauge transformations

the constraint equations for the vertex operators are also invariant under gauge trans-

formations. we use these to identify the physical degrees of freedom of the vertex operator

(2.13) as follows. useful gauge symmetries of the at space equations are

v = g+

j(z) = eieihc , j(z) = eieih c. since fermionic conformal elds do not
commute, i.e. ei(z) e()  e() ei(z), the notation is dened as ei+  ei e, etc.

using the transformations (3.1)

one can gauge x to zero the vertex operators
v1,1, v1,1, v0,1, v1,0, v1,1, and therefore they do not correspond to propagating de-
grees of freedom. furthermore this gauge symmetry can be used both to set to zero the

components of v1,1 with no s or no s, and to gauge x all components of v0,1, v1,0, v0,0

8

that are independent of those of v1,1. the physical degrees of freedom are thus described
by a supereld [4]

this has the eld content of d = 6, n = (2, 0) supergravity with one supergravity and one

tensor multiplet [5]. as explained in [4], in at space, the surviving constraint equations

in the set (2.14)-(2.16) imply that the component elds  are all on shell massless elds,

the equations of motion (3.3) for the at space vertex operator component elds describe

d = 6, n = (2, 0) supergravity expanded around the six-dimensional minkowski metric.
in ads3  s3 space there are corresponding gauge transformations which reduce the
number of degrees of freedom to those in (3.2) , but the laplacian must be replaced by the

ads laplacian, and the constraints are likewise deformed. in section 4, we focus on the

vertex operator v11 that carries the physical degrees of freedom. we derive the conditions
on its eld components that follow from the ads vertex operator constraint equations

(2.18)-(2.20), and give their residual gauge invariances explicitly. in section 5, we show

these conditions are equivalent to the d = 6, n = (2, 0) linearized supergravity equations
expanded around the ads3  s3 metric.

in order to compare this with supergravity, we want to reexpress the above formulas

in terms of covariant derivatives dp on the group manifold. we will, however, write

everything in terms of right- or left-invariant vielbeins described in section 2 and appendix

b. so we write

t cd
l  p cd dp ,

t cd
r  p cd dp .

(4.9)

l = p cddp, tcd

we also have corresponding objects tcd
r = p cddp , where (in contrast
to dp which is the covariant derivative with the levi-civita connection) d and d are
covariant derivatives dened such that right- or left-invariant vector elds are covariantly
constant. acting on a function, tl = tl and tr = tr, since both just act geometrically.
but they dier in acting on elds that carry spinor or vector indices. for example, on

5. d = 6, n = (2, 0) supergravity on ads3  s3

in this section we show that the string constraints described in section 5, which were
derived from the ads3  s3 supersymmetric vertex operator equations (2.18)-(2.20), are
equivalent to the supergravity equations for the supergravity multiplet and one tensor
multiplet of d = 6, n = (2, 0) supergravity expanded around the ads3  s3 metric and
a self-dual three-form. we give the identication of the string vertex operator components

in terms of the supergravity elds.

in at space, the vertex operator eld components can be described by representations

of the d = 6 little group so(4). the supergravity multiplet is (3, 3) + 5(3, 1) + 4(3, 2) and

the tensor multiplet is (1, 3) + 5(1, 1) + 4(1, 2). here (3, 3) is the graviton eld gmn, the

oscillation around the at metric; the two-form bmn has so(4) spin content (1, 3) + (3, 1);
and the dilaton  is (1, 1). the bispinor elds f ++ab, v ab
self-dual tensors (3, 1) and four scalars (1, 1). the four gravitinos 4(3, 2) and four spinors
4(1, 2) are labelled by +a

in ads3  s3 space, the number of physical degrees of freedom in the vertex operator
(2.13) remains the same as in the at case, but the eld gmn is now related to the oscillation
around the ads3s3 metric. for this metric to be a solution of the supergravity equations
[5], there must be also either a non-vanishing (real) self-dual tensor eld or a non-vanishing

(real) anti-self-dual tensor eld. expanding around this classical solution, we will nd that

we need to choose one of the real self-dual tensor elds to be non-vanishing at zeroeth order,

to be able to identify these linearized supergravity equations with the constraints of the

string model.

we will see that the two-form bmn is a linear combination of all the oscillations cor-

responding to the ve self-dual tensor elds and the anti-self-dual tensor eld, including

14

the oscillation with non-vanishing background. in at space, bmn corresponds to a state

in the neveu-schwarz sector. in our curved space case, the string model describes vertex

operators for ads3 background with ramond-ramond ux. when matching the vertex
operator component elds with the supergravity oscillations, we nd that not only the
bispinor v ab
bmn include supergravity oscillations with non-vanishing self-dual background. we use the

(which is a ramond-ramond eld in the at space case), but also the tensor

romans variables [5] to describe the ads supergravity equations, where the three-form
eld strengths are labelled by one anti-self-dual kmnp and ve self-dual h i
mnp elds. our
procedure will be to start in this section with the supergravity equations, and rewrite them

as equations for the eld combinations that occur in the string theory vertex operators. we

then show that these equations are equivalent to the string constraint equations (4.3)-(4.8).

we list the eld identications at the end of this section.

the product of sigma matrices < gmnp > (mnp)ab ab is self-dual. similarly
(mnp)ab ab is anti-self-dual. the sigma matrices mab describe the coupling of two 4s
to a 6 of su (4). they are su (4) singlets, whereas ab, though an so(4) singlet, transforms

in the symmetric second rank tensor 10 of su (4). from the group theory properties of

the sigma matrices, we see that < gmnp > is a 10 of su (4), so the product of the two
self-dual tensors, which is a singlet of su (4), must be zero < gmnp > < gmnp >= 0, since
10  10 = 20 + 35 + 45 does not contain a singlet. this is consistent with the general
identities [5] that

appendix b. covariant derivatives on a group manifold

on a group manifold, there is always a right-invariant vielbein and a left-invariant

vielbein; for the so(4) case, we write them as

and

respectively. the vielbein obeys

emab = mab

emab = mab

emab ecd

m = abcd ,

emab encd abcd = 4 gmn .

(b.1)

(b.2)

(b.3)

using the right-invariant vielbein, the covariant derivative on the group manifold can

be conveniently written

dmvgh = mvgh  1
4 f

cd

ef eef

m vcd

gh

(b.4)

for vgh antisymmetric in g,h. here by f we mean the structure constants f a
bc, with a, b,
and c being lie algebra indices, but for the group so(4), the lie algebra is the second
rank antisymmetric tensor representation, and we write a lie algebra index as a pair ab

with antisymmetry understood. it is convenient to refer the covariant derivative to the
r = emabdm,
right-invariant vielbein, dening t ab
using the left-invariant vielbein.

l = emabdm. similarly, we dene t ab

it is also convenient to let tl be a covariant derivative that is dened by using the
right-invariant vielbein and setting the spin connection to zero; likewise, tr is a covariant
derivative dened using the left-invariant vielbein and setting the spin connection to zero.
thus, tl and tr are the covariant derivatives dened using the right- and left-invariant
framings of the group manifold.

from the above formulas, one can deduce the relation between tl and tl. on a lie

algebra valued eld vgh (= vhg) we have
tab
l vgh = t ab

l vgh + 1

2 f cdab

gh

vcd .

from this, we can deduce that on a spinor eld the relation is

2 b
and on a eld with two pairs of anti-symmetric indices it is

tab
l vg = t ab

g bcvc  1

l vg + 1

2 a

g acvc

(b.5)

(b.6)

l vgh jk + 1

tab
l vgh jk = t ab

the above formulas have obvious counterparts for tr and tr.
it is convenient, as in the case of the sigma matrices, to raise and lower the index
