abstract

three dierent methods to quantize the spherically symmetric sector of electro-
magnetism are presented: first, it is shown that this sector is equivalent to abelian
bf -theory in four spacetime dimensions with suitable boundary conditions. this
theory, in turn, is quantized by both a reduced phase space quantization and a spin
network quantization. finally, the outcome is compared with the results obtained in
the recently proposed general quantum symmetry reduction scheme. in the magnet-
ically uncharged sector, where all three approaches apply, they all lead to the same
quantum theory.

1 introduction

recently, h. kastrup and the author proposed a general framework for a quantum sym-
metry reduction procedure of dieomorphism invariant theories of connections [1]. in the
case of a reduction of electromagnetism to its spherically symmetric sector an explicit
expression for the quantum symmetry reduction and for the observables of the reduced
theory was obtained. in the present paper we study this sector in more detail by providing
another approach to symmetry reduction and quantization which, however, has the draw-
backs of being applicable for this special theory only and of requiring a vanishing magnetic
charge (or an explicit coupling to an external one). nevertheless, the methods involved are
more standard and this alternative quantization can serve as a simple test of the general
quantum symmetry reduction of ref. [1].

the new approach makes use of a novel identication of an abelian bf -theory [2]
with the spherically symmetric sector of electromagnetism. more precisely, it is proved
that a partial gauge xing of an abelian bf -theory with suitable boundary conditions is
equivalent to this symmetric sector upon a straightforward identication of their variables.
the two constraints of the bf -theory provide the gauss constraint of electromagnetism,

and a second constraint which on the one hand serves to perform after gauge xing a
symmetry reduction of the theory and on the other hand constrains the magnetic charge
to vanish.

at rst sight it may be surprising that we identify a sector of electromagnetism with a
topological eld theory, but this causes no problems because the kinematics of the spher-
ically symmetric sector is indeed dieomorphism invariant, which leads to boundary ob-
servables only (the electric charge and its conjugate momentum) after solving the gauss
constraint. but the dynamics is not dieomorphism invariant because we need a back-
ground metric to construct the hamiltonian. alternatively, we can couple the spherically
symmetric sector to gravitation, thereby rendering the metric dynamical and restoring
dieomorphism invariance. this leads to an interpretation of the spherically symmetric
sector of electromagnetism as the electromagnetic part of a reissner-nordstrm gravita-
tional system (which was our original motivation to study this sector). however, as the
gravitational degrees of freedom complicate the theory considerably, we will not study their
dynamics in this article.

in order to be able to ignore the gravitational degrees of freedom, and at the same
time maintain dieomorphism invariance (which is necessary to employ a spin network
quantization) we regard the electromagnetic sector as a spherically symmetric sector of
electromagnetism coupled to gravity, but on a degenerate gravitational sector. thereby
the electromagnetic degrees of freedom are decoupled and we can study them isolated from
the complicated gravitational dynamics. note that a degeneracy of the metric does not
prevent electric and magnetic ows, and the densitized electric and magnetic elds from
being well-dened. the usual electromagnetic hamiltonian, however, vanishes, so we can
study a static electromagnetism only.

the plan of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we will prove the central assertion of this
paper, namely the equivalence of the abelian bf -theory with the spherically symmetric
sector of electromagnetism, discuss the boundary conditions and present the reduced phase
space quantization. the corresponding spin network quantization, which is also useful for
a general bf -theory and not just for the special case related to spherically symmetric
electromagnetism, is developed in section 3 leading to the same results as in the reduced
phase space quantization of section 2. finally, we will recall results obtained in the general
symmetry reduction scheme of ref. [1] and compare them with the approaches of the
present paper. in the appendices we will describe the dimensions used here, and recall the
classical reduction from ref. [3] as well as basics about u(1)-spin networks.

2 bf -theory

as already noted above, the quantization of spherically symmetric electromagnetism pre-
sented here is related to a bf -theory which requires a vanishing magnetic eld a. we thus
are lead to study an abelian bf -theory [2, 4] which has, besides the gau constraint anal-
ogous to that of electromagnetism, a second constraint fab = abcc  0 which constrains
the curvature of a u(1)-connection to vanish.

2.1 action and constraints

the theory we start with has as variables a two-form b and a u(1)-connection  on a
four-dimensional spacetime manifold of the form m =   r. the curvature of  is given
by f = d and appears in the bf -action (for the denitions of our dimensions and the
constants q and  see appendix a)

we now insert the 3 + 1-decomposition b = 1

(2)

in the last step we introduced the eld a := 1
2abcbbc, which will later be identied with
the electric eld. these eld components are canonically conjugate to a with the poisson
structure given by eq. (a.1). the remaining components a := b0a of b and 0 are
lagrange multipliers which upon variation lead to the constraints

d3x0aa  0,

f0[a] :=

d3xaabcfbc  0.

g[0] :=z

(4)

boundary conditions, which are important because we had to integrate by parts, are dis-
cussed in the next subsection.

the gau constraint generates gauge transformations of  as in electromagnetism,
whereas the new constraints f0 constrains the magnetic eld to vanish. more important
here is the fact that f0 generates gauge transformations of a which eect the symmetry
reduction. this is stated as

lemma 1 the set of all spherically symmetric elds a = ((t, x), 0, 0) (in a polar coordi-
nate system with radial coordinate x) with the boundary condition (t, ) = 0 is a set of
representatives of the gauge equivalence classes of electric elds in the bf -theory eq. (1)
vanishing at innity.

proof: because of {f0[a], b} = 0, {f0[d], a} = q1abcbc the gauge transformations
generated by f0 lead to the addition of an exact two-form to the dual two-form abcc of
a.

first we show that two dierent symmetric electric elds a

same f0-gauge class. by assumption the dierence a = a

1 and a

2 cannot lie in the

 =  = 0 (x,  and  are spherical coordinates).
transformation generated by some a, this function had to obey the equations

if that dierence was a gauge

 = x  x = 0 ,

 = x  x = 0.

this, in turn, would imply

xx = x(  ) = x  x = 0,

i.e., the dierence of the electric elds would be a constant which had to vanish due to
the boundary condition. therefore, each gauge class contains at most one spherically
symmetric electric eld.

we now prove that each class contains at least one spherically symmetric electric eld.
in order to show this we need a vector eld n a on  which is spherically symmetric, i.e.,
d2san a = 1
for all so(3)-orbits sx in . such a eld exists because, for the symmetry reduced theory
to be non-trivial, we have to assume that there is at least one spherically symmetric electric
eld a

n a = (n(t, x), 0, 0), and which is subject to the conditions an a = 0 and rsx

0, by means of which we can construct

n a(t, x) :=(cid:18)zsx

d2saa

0(cid:19)1

0.

the existence of such a non-trivial eld a
0 depends on the topology of . it always exists
in the manifolds of appendix b. the properties of n a postulated above follow from the
ones of a

0 does not depend on x (due to aa

0 = 0).

0 and the fact that rsx

d2saa

the averaged eld a(t, x) := n arsx
constraint aa = 0. furthermore, we have rsx

let a(t, x, , ) now be a eld vanishing at innity. due to the properties of n a
d2sbb is spherically symmetric and fullls the gau
d2sa(  )a = 0, which remains valid after
replacing sx by an arbitrary closed surface. according to de rham duality of homology and
cohomology groups the dierence of the two elds is cohomologically trivial and, therefore,
exact: a  a = abcbc with an appropriate c. an electric eld and its spherically
symmetric average, therefore, lie in the same gauge class.

summarizing, we have proved that each gauge class contains exactly one spherically

symmetric electric eld.

the meaning of this lemma is that the spherical symmetry reduction of electromag-
netism in its magnetically uncharged sector can be viewed as gauge xing of the trans-
formations generated by the constraint f0 of the associated abelian bf -theory. the
remaining gau constraint has the same meaning in both theories generating the gauge
transformations a 7 a + a0. using fab = 0 and a xed basis ([(k)]) of h 1(, r) any
connection can be written as a = (k)
a + al with some function l:   r. each function
l can be gauged to the spherically symmetric value l = 0 by the gauge transformation
l 7 l + 0 with 0 := l. analogously, bab dxa  dxb is closed due to the gau constraint
g, and f0 generates an additional exact two-form added to bab dxa  dxb. this shows

4

that on a manifold without boundary the reduced phase space of bf -theory is given by
the product h 1(, r)  h 2(, r) of rst and second de rham cohomology groups [2].

however, in the manifolds used in the spherically symmetric context (appendix b)
we have h 1(, r) = 0, whereas h 2(, r) does not need to be even dimensional and is,
therefore, inappropriate as phase space. this is possible because we use manifolds with
boundary where h 1(, r) = 0 and h 2(, r) do not have necessarily the same dimension.
furthermore, the constraints are aected by the presence of a boundary and the consid-
eration of the preceding paragraph cannot be applied unaltered: the function l can now
be gauged to be zero only in the interior of , whereas it remains arbitrary at the bound-
ary. taking the boundary properly into account will thus lead to new boundary degrees of
freedom, which will render the reduced phase space even dimensional.

2.2 surface terms and boundary degrees of freedom

before discussing boundary conditions we will slightly generalize in the bf -theory context
the manifolds dened in appendix b by increasing the number of boundary components.
because we are interested mainly in the boundary degrees of freedom, we will conne
ourselves to manifolds with a trivial rst homology group only.

besides the wormhole manifold w 3 := r  s2 with h2(w 3, z) = z and boundary

w 3 =: w 3 =: +w 3  w 3 = s2  s2

with two boundary components at positive and negative innity (the boundary is a dis-
joint union of two s2), we will use the punctured manifolds p 3
n := r3\{p1, . . . , pn} with
n , z) = zn. equivalently, we can cut out of r3 a small ball centered in each of the
h2(p 3
points pi resulting in new boundary components ip 3
n

having n + 1 components. similar to the wormhole manifold above we denote with p 3
n
the part of the boundary lying at innity, which topologically is just a specication of a
distinguished boundary component. due to the non-trivial second homology groups these
manifolds allow topological electric charge, and therefore we do not have to couple matter
elds as sources of charge. of course, w 3 is homeomorphic to p 3
1 , but the interpretation is
dierent as a spacelike section in the reissner-nordstrm manifold as opposed to a point
charge sitting in the origin.

for the constraints to be functionally dierentiable we have to impose boundary condi-
tions, and to correct the action by boundary terms. boundary conditions for bf -theories
have already been discussed in refs. [5, 6, 7], but here we choose dierent ones adapted to
the interpretation as spherically symmetric electromagnetism.

the variation of the constraints is

g[0] = z
f0[a] = z

d3x0aa = z
d3xaabcbc = z

d3xaa0 +z
d3xabc(ba)c +z

d2sa0a,

d2sbabcac.

(5)

(6)

5

in order to achieve functional dierentiability the surface integrals have to vanish or to be
compensated by appropriate boundary terms in the action.

this can be enforced, rst for the variation of g, by the condition 0| = 0 for gauge
transformations.
if we have instead 0 = o(1) on , the generated transformation is
viewed as symmetry transformation. for the surface integral to vanish in this case we
must require  = o(r(2+)),  > 0 on  and |i = 0 which is also necessary for
symmetry transformations not to change the charge. surface variables are given by

o[0] :=z

d3xaa0 =z

d2sa0a

, 0 = o(1),

(7)

further constrained by f0, however.

according to lemma 1 the transformations generated by f0 are necessary for a sym-
metry reduction. therefore, we want to regard them as gauge transformations in any case
without specifying further boundary conditions on a. we need a surface term in the action
(2) with a variation eliminating the surface integral in eq. (6). the corrected action is

(9)

the boundary values of 0 on  are prescribed functions, which are determined by an
external observer, depending on the time variable t. in contrast, a is regarded as lagrange
multiplier also at the boundary leading to the corrected curvature constraint

f [a] = f0 z

d2sbabcac.

note that we did not specify boundary conditions for a in the context of f . there-
fore, variation of the boundary values leads to the so-called natural boundary conditions.
thereby we obtain the surface constraints naabcc|  0 (na being the normal on ),
which yield that l is locally constant on the boundary, i.e., constant on each boundary
component, after inserting c = cl. together with lemma 1 we can now see full equiva-
lence to spherically symmetric electromagnetism of appendix b (for the manifolds w 3 or
p 3

1 ):

theorem 1 the partially reduced phase space of the abelian bf -theory obtained after
solving only the constraint f is equivalent to the phase space of spherically symmetric
electromagnetism.

6

before reducing the theory completely we check the algebra of constraints. because g

and f contain either a or a, we have

{g[0], g[

0]} = {f [a], f [

b]} = 0.

the mixed poisson bracket is

{g[0], f [a]} = 

= 



q z
q z



d3x(c0)baabc =

d0  d

d( d0  ) = 

d0  ,



q z
q z



(10)

(11)

which vanishes for gauge transformations because then 0 has to vanish on the boundary.
therefore, the constraints are rst class. for the poisson bracket to vanish we must have
d0| = 0 which is also fullled for some special symmetry transformations (for which
0| 6= 0, but locally constant). because  is arbitrary at the boundary the surface
variables o[0] are observables exactly if 0| is locally constant:

{o[0], f [a]} = 0.

(12)

the observables o[0] (with unrestricted 0) have already appeared in ref. [6], together
with additional surface observables which are integrals of a associated with boundary
values of a. these latter observables are excluded here by our special boundary conditions
(free boundary values of the lagrange multiplier a). it also leads to the restriction of 0 in
o[0] to be locally constant on . the special treatment of a, leading to these two eects,
is crucial for the identication with the spherically symmetric sector of electromagnetism
(see also eq. (13) below); and we will see that the remaining surface observables are just
the correct ones for this application.

2.3 reduction and quantization

the constraints are easy to solve: f forces the connection a to be at, i.e., a = al
for some l:   r. since g generates the gauge transformation l 7 l + 0 with an arbi-
trary 0 vanishing on the boundary, only the boundary values of l have physical meaning.
furthermore, due to the boundary constraints

c[b|] :=z

dsaabcbc =z

dsaabcbcl  0

(13)

l has to be constant on each boundary component because the a are arbitrary at . this
is the most important consequence of our special boundary conditions introduced above.
the physical degrees of freedom associated with a can also be localized at the boundary

and given by integrals

pa :=za

d2saa

7

(14)

over each of the n + 1 boundary components, i.e. pa = o[a

0 ] with a

0 |b = a

b. they

are not all independent, however, because of pa pa = r d2saa = r d3xaa = 0 as

a consequence of the gau constraint. as above, the constraints imply that the class of
abcc in the second de rham cohomology group represents the physical degree of freedom
specied by its evaluation on all classes of the second homology group. choosing as rep-
resentatives for a basis of the second homology groups of the two manifolds (+) and
(i)1in, respectively, we arrive at the independent observables p+ and p1, . . . , pn.

from eq. (9) we derive the reduced hamiltonian: at rst we insert the bulk constraints

to obtain

h  =

q

z

d2sa(0a  abcbc) =

d2sa( la  abcbcl).

(15)

q

z

in the second part of this equation we provided a time dependence for l by dening l := 0,
which formally extends the relation a = al to the four-dimensional connection on   r.
the boundary values of a are the remaining lagrange multipliers, and their variation
leads to the boundary constraints c of eq. (13). the solution of these requires a locally
constant l on the boundary eliminating the second term in h :

h  =

q

z

d2sa la =

q

xa

laza

d2saa =

q

xa

lapa,

(16)

where a runs over all n + 1 boundary components and la is the constant value of l on the
component a.

up to now the constraints are not solved completely: there remains the condition

pa pa = r d2saa  0 implied by g  0. therefore, only n of the n + 1 boundary

variables pa are independent. at the same time, the remaining constraint generates the
gauge transformation la 7 la +c with some c being constant on the full boundary (not just
locally constant). one of the la can thereby be gauged to zero, and we end up with only
n independent values of the la. in our manifolds we will choose the gauge xing l = 0 in
w 3 and l = 0 in p 3

n , respectively. finally we obtain the reduced hamiltonian

hred =

lapa , a = + or a  {1, . . . , n}.

(17)

q

xa

a comparison with appendix b shows that this is, on the manifolds w 3 or p 3
1 , the reduced
hamiltonian of spherically symmetric electromagnetism with the prescribed function of t
being l = u, which reveals that its boundary dynamics is equivalent to that of bf -theory,
too. the canonical variables

(pa, q1a)a=+ or a{1,...,n}

are action-angle coordinates of the reduced hamiltonian. the equations of motion are
solved by

pa = ca
a = c

a  la(t)

8

with constants ca, c

a to be specied by initial values.

this system with phase space t rn can be quantized without problems. as hilbert
space we choose l2(rn, dnx), n + 1 being the number of boundary components. in the
-representation states are given by (1, . . . , n), acted on by a and pa as usually:

a = a ,

pa =

(18)

this quantization leads to a continuous spectrum of the charges pa, but a quantization
condition can be imposed by a  s1 = r/2z, justied by the fact that  represents a
lu(1) element: l and l+2 yield the same element exp il = exp i(l+2) of the gauge group.
this periodical identication of the phase space leads to charge quantization: simultaneous
eigenstates of the pa = iq 
a
eigenvalue qka of pa. the periodic identication demands ka  z leading to

are given by {ka}(1, . . . , n) = qa exp ikaa with

pa  qz for all a

(19)

which is the observed charge quantization with a fundamental charge q. its value, however,
cannot be determined because the theory contains one free parameter . in the present
context the periodic identication of a looks somewhat ad-hoc, but the quantization
condition (19) will arise in the following spin network quantization more naturally.

3 spin network quantization of bf -theory

in the preceding section we arrived at a quantization of abelian bf -theory, which can be
interpreted as a quantum theory of spherically symmetric electromagnetism. in order to
compare with the results of the quantum symmetry reduction procedure it is, however, more
instructive to present a spin network quantization, too. the solution of the constraints
will be given in the same order as in the symplectic reduction of the previous section:
we rst solve the gau constraint, then the curvature constraint to arrive at a boundary
theory, and nally the boundary constraints. our notation for u(1)-spin networks, which
are extensively used in this section, is described in appendix c.

3.1 gau constraint

of course, the gau constraint can be solved by using only gauge invariant spin networks,
i.e., those with kv = 0 for each vertex v, but for the sake of completeness we will give also
a quantization of the classical constraint g.

let  be a graph and f be a cylindrical function which depends on a connection a
only via the edge holonomies e for all e  e(). on that function the gau constraint
acts as

g[0]f = z

recall the denition of sgn(v, e) given in appendix c which implies that in the last sum
only edges incident in v contribute.

the g[0] commute with one another which means that the classical algebra of con-
straints is represented anomaly-free. applied to a spin network state tk the constraint

yields g[0]tk = qpvv () 0(v)kvtk, implying that the solution space of the con-

straint is given by gauge invariant spin networks with kv = 0 for all vertices v 6 , as
anticipated. this constrains, however, only vertices in the interior of  because at the
boundary we had to demand 0| = 0 in the constraint. therefore, kv for v    v ()
is arbitrary meaning that at the boundary edges of a spin network can end. this is analo-
gous to the boundary observables o appearing in the second section, and it makes possible
electric charge. the electric charge q[s] enclosed by a closed surface s   is given by

the integral rs d2saa in the classical case, which depends only on the homology class of

s. this lead us to use topologies of  with non-trivial second homology groups to allow
electric charge, and it follows classically from the stokes theorem in a well-known fash-
ion: if s1 and s2 are the equally oriented boundary components of a domain b  , we
d2saa as a consequence of the gau constraint

have 0 = rb d3xaa = rs1

aa  0.

d2saa rs2

the reason for our dwelling on that point is that in the quantum theory there is
an analogous, but quite dierently, namely topologically realized version. here, the gau
constraint manifests itself in the condition kv = 0. at rst we quantize the charge functional
applied to a function cylindrical with respect to a graph  which is chosen such that all
the intersection points v  v (  s) are vertices of :

q[s] = zs

d2ynaa = qzs

d2y xee()ze

= q xvv ()sxev

sgn(e, s)e


e

dtna ea(y, e(t))e


e

.

(20)

here, sgn(e, s) is the intersection number of e with s which is dened to be 1

2 if e  s  e.

the charge of a spin network state tk is proportional to pes6= sgn(e, s)ke which can be

interpreted as the intersection number of s with a curve associated to tk. this curve,

10

which is disconnected in general, can be constructed by stacking |ke| copies of each edge
e  e() on top of each other. all such copies incident in a vertex v can be linked there to
form curves with no endpoints in v if and only if kv = 0. in the interior of a domain b as
above we therefore obtain pieces of curves ending only at the boundary b = s1 s
2 (s is
s in opposite orientation) if and only if the spin network state is gauge invariant. if there
are only divalent vertices at b, the charges q[s1]t,k and q[s2]t,k are equal being given
by intersection numbers of homologically equivalent closed surfaces with a closed curve:
each curve entering b through s1 has to leave b either again through s1, which does not
contribute to both charges measured by s1 and s2, or it runs through s2 contributing to
the two charges the same amount.

3.2 curvature constraint

as opposed to the gau constraint the curvature constraint cannot be solved in a subspace
of the space of cylindrical functions, but it has to be solved by means of a rigging map [8].
this map can be written formally as multiplication with a delta function supported on the
space of at connections which will be constructed in this subsection.

3.2.1 the space a0 of pure gauge connections

in the simply connected topologies used here f = 0 means that a = al is pure gauge.
holonomies associated with an edge e are

e(l) = exp(cid:18)ize

dl(cid:19) = exp(cid:16)i(l(e(1))  l(e(0)))(cid:17),

which depend on l only in the starting point e(0) and the end point e(1) of e. a spin
network state, therefore, depends only on the values of the gauge potential l in its vertices:

exp(i sgn(v, e)kel(v)) = exp(ikvl(v)).

ye

by using the pure gauge connection each point v   is mapped to a u(1) group element
(v) := exp(il(v)), and a spin network state evaluated in this connection takes the form

qvv () (v)kv. the function :   u(1) is smooth for a classical connection, but it will

be generalized to an arbitrary function in the course of quantization:

denition 1 a0 := {:   u(1) smooth} is the space of pure gauge connections.

the space of generalized pure gauge connections is a0 := {:   u(1)}.

analogously to g in ref. [8], the space a0 can be constructed as a projective limit with
index set being the set of all nite subsets   , ||  n0 of , and with cylindrical spaces
a0, := u(1) being the spaces of all maps from  to u(1) and projections p() = |
for   a0,. then we have

a0 = proj lim


a0, = proj lim


u(1)  u(1).

11

a cylindrical basis of functions on a0 associated to the index set of all nite subsets 

together with labelings k:   z\{0} is given by the functions t,k() :=qp (p)kp. for

 xed these are the monomials in the nitely many variables (p), p  , which certainly
span the space of functions on a0, modulo functions which are constant in some (p),
i.e., functions on a space a0, with   . analogously to the ashtekar-lewandowski
measure we can dene a measure on a0 cylindrically:

lemma 2 a dieomorphism invariant probability measure on a0 is given by

(f ) :=za0

df := (f) :=zu (1)||

d||

h (1, . . . , ||)f(1, . . . , ||)

for some representative f of f . di() acts on a0, by u()f = f().

the monomials t,k form an orthonormal basis with respect to this measure.

proof: the cylindrical consistency condition for the measure and its normalization as well
as dieomorphism invariance follow from properties of the haar measure.

proving orthonormality.

for  = v () and k being the vertex labeling of a spin network state t,k we have
t,k() = t,k(1 d) showing that the t,k emerge by restriction of spin network states
to pure gauge connections. to each spin network t,k we can associate a monomial
t,k =: t,k and continue the operation  to the space  of all cylindrical functions
on a. formally, we can write t,k = (f )t,k with

(f ) := yezu (1)

dh(ae)(cid:0)ae, (e(0))1(e(1))(cid:1) .

given a cylindrical function f we have to interpret (f )f as a distribution on the space
of cylindrical functions, and equivalently (f ):    as a rigging map according to

this map solves the constraint f on a subspace of .

3.2.2 boundary spin networks

up to now we solved the constraints g and f separately. to solve them together we
have to investigate the space a0/g. in contrast to a0, the space g consists of functions
g:   u(1) which have to become unity on the boundary , and it acts on a0 as
(g  )(p) = g(p)(p) (note that  is the exponentiated gauge potential of a connection;
therefore, g does not act by conjugation). for  without boundary we have a0/g = {1},
and similar to the boundary observables in the classical theory non-trivial states emerge
only in presence of a boundary. we have the projective spaces

a0,/g = {:   u(1)|(p) = 1 if p 6 }

with limit

all degrees of freedom are localized at the boundary of  motivating

a0/g = a0/g = {:   u(1)}.

denition 2 the space of functions on the space a0/g of gauge invariant pure gauge
connections is spanned by boundary spin networks t,k with nite sets    and labelings

k:   z\{0}. the associated boundary state is given by t,k() :=qp (p)kp.

these functions t,k span the boundary hilbert space when completed with respect to

the measure  of lemma 2.

the fundamental operations can also be projected down from the spin network basis by
inserting pure gauge connections. the holonomy to an edge e in  with e   = e(1) =: p
is

e =

.

(p)

(e(0))

gauge invariant is only (p) leading to the multiplication operator p := (p) instead of
e. its action on a boundary spin network t,k is to increase kp by 1.

the other fundamental operator associated to e is the derivative operator e:

et,k = e


e

t,k =

(p)



(e(0))

(e(0))1(p)

t,k = (p)



(p)

t,k = kpt,k,

where we used independence of t,k on (e(0)). this operator also acts only in the point p
and can be written as

p := p


p

.

in this way we obtain multiplication and dierentiation on the monomials, out of which,
together with the adjoint of p, we can build all local operators. the space of boundary
spin networks resembles the construction of a fock space with one-particle hilbert spaces
l2(u(1), dh) associated to each point p  , but without any symmetrization (it is
neither bosonic nor fermionic). the operators p and p act as creation and number
operator, respectively.
in contrast to a usual fock space (as, e.g., used in ref. [6] for
similar purposes) we can represent the full group of boundary dieomorphisms on our
boundary hilbert space with a dieomorphism invariant measure, which is, of course, a
consequence of our usage of spin network techniques.

13

3.3 boundary constraints

the bulk constraints g and f are now solved on a0/g. however, the boundary constraints
c, which force l to be constant on each of the n + 1 boundary components, still remain
to be solved. we have to impose them on boundary spin network states by restricting
these functions to locally constant  = a on each a. a restricted state is completely
determined by an integer

for each boundary component a, which can be seen from the calculation

ka := xpa

kp

t,k()|c=0 =ya

ppa kp

a

=ya

ka
a =: |k1, . . . , kn+1i .

(23)

as in the classical reduction there remains one last condition following from gauge
invariance. the boundary spin networks descend from gauge invariant spin networks in

the course of constraint reduction, which implies pa ka = 0. again, only n of the n + 1
numbers ka are to be chosen freely. accordingly, the a can be multiplied by some 0
which is constant on the whole boundary, because states change then by multiplication with
a factor p a ka
= 1. this freedom can be xed by imposing the condition a = 1 for some
xed boundary component a, analogous to the classical case, and discarding its charge ka.
the states |k1, . . . , kni labeled by the remaining n charges build an orthonormal basis of
the physical hilbert space hphys = l2(u(1)n, dn
h) with the inner product descending
from the space of boundary spin networks:

0

hk1, . . . , kn || k 

1, . . . , k 

dh(a)k 

a

aka

finally, we need a representation of the poisson algebra of the canonical variables
(pa, a) on the physical hilbert space. the operators are to be built from the boundary
operators p and p, and they can be deduced from their action on three-dimensional spin
network states.

according to appendix b, pa and a are in generalization from the spherically sym-
metric case, i.e., from the manifolds w 3 or p 3
1 , given by the charge on the boundary
component a and by the holonomy associated with a radial curve ba ending on a:

pa =za

d2saa

, a = zba

 = i log ba.

(26)

these expressions are the same as the reduced phase space variables of the preceding
section. to obtain independent variables we have to choose n out of the n + 1 boundary

14

where, formally,

ni := ht,k, (c)t,ki :=ya zu (1)
(c) :=ya ypazu (1)

dh(p)(p, a).

components (as in eq. (17), for instance), the index a running over them in the following.
the excluded component can be used to provide a starting point for the curves ba (for
a to be gauge invariant ba cannot start in the interior of ). in this way, each curve
intersects only one of the distinguished components a.

pa is quantized by using eq. (20). the surface s in this equation is chosen to be
homologically equivalent to the boundary component a and lying in the interior of . s
must not be the boundary component itself because this would introduce a factor of 1
2 since
all edges would end on s. note that charges are dened in the classical calculation also by
choosing a surface in the interior and computing the limit where this surface approaches the
boundary at innity (which is, of course, only necessary if there is no gau law, as e.g. for
the adm mass in a theory of gravity). however, for a boundary around a point charge we
could equally well integrate over the boundary in the classical theory. in quantum theory
this is no longer the case due to the distributional nature of generalized connections. on
boundary spin networks we obtain

pat,k = q xpa

p


p

t,k = q xpa

kpt,k = qkat,k,

which is to be projected into the physical hilbert space:

pa |k1, . . . , kni = qka |k1, . . . , kni .

(27)

on spin network states the basic multiplication operator is not a, but the holonomy

a := ba = exp(cid:18)izba

(cid:19) = exp(ia)

with operation

exp(i a) |k1, . . . , kni = a |k1, . . . , kni = |k1, . . . , ka + 1, . . . , kni

(28)

because a reduces to multiplication with (ba(1)) (see subsection 3.2.2, ba(1) denotes
the endpoint of ba). the operator a can be interpreted as shifting charge from the
excluded boundary component to the component a along the curve ba (or rather its
dieomorphism class). in this way, the total charge situated on all the boundary compo-
nents remains constant, namely zero.

we can now quote from ref. [1] the following

theorem 2 the equations (27) and (28) dene a representation of the classical poisson
-algebra on hphys.

proof: the proof is the same as in ref. [1] except for an obvious generalization to n
variables.

15

we note that the adjointness relations  pa being self-adjoint and a being unitary 
uniquely (up to a constant factor) determine the inner product (24) which was derived
by descending from the ashtekar-lewandowski measure. moreover, holonomy variables of
spin network quantization turn out to be well suited to represent the classical algebra of
observables. as opposed to ref. [7] we did not have to use a normal ordering to dene
charge creation (or rather shifting) operators: due to the basic assumption of every spin
network quantization, namely that holonomies are well dened in quantum theory, the
operators a are perfectly well dened in our hilbert space.

in complete analogy to the reduced phase space method we arrived at the same quan-
tum theory with one degree of freedom per boundary component given by the electric
charge. moreover, we obtain automatically a discrete charge spectrum (this has already
been observed in ref. [9] in case of unreduced u(1)-spin networks) with eigenvalues qka
of the charge operator belonging to the boundary component a being integer multiples
of q, which is however undetermined. this leads again to the charge spectrum (19).

3.4 rigging map

as noted already, the curvature and boundary constraints cannot be solved in a subspace of
the space  spanned by spin network states, but they have according to rened algebraic
quantization [8] to be solved in its topological dual . what we have to do now is
to present a rigging map implementing the constraints. this can be constructed by using
partial rigging maps corresponding to the curvature and boundary constraints, respectively.
the basic ingredient for the rigging map 1:    has already been given in eq. (22).

there we named it more pictorially 1f := (f )f.

in a second step we have to implement the boundary constraint c. with the help of 1
we went to the space  of boundary spin networks t,k, which is interpreted as a subspace
of  analogously to eq. (22). now we have to start from  to go over to its dual .
again, this can formally be done by means of a delta distribution, (c) in eq. (25), which
enforces  to take the constant value a at each boundary component a. the result of
a multiplication with (c) is a function depending only on the n variables a which we
a (see eq. (23)). this function is in the dual of 

denoted above as |k1, . . . , kni =qa ka

by means of

|k1, . . . , kni (t,k) :=ya
=zu (1)n

dnh(1, . . . , n)ya
dnh(1, . . . , n)ya

ka,ppa kp

(29)

ppa kpka

a

ka
a

ya ypazu (1)

dh(p)(p, a)t,k().

in the last step it is written as an integral of the two functions multiplied with the delta

16

distribution (c). eq. (29) leads to the second rigging map

2:   

,

ka := xpa

kp+ ,

t,k 7(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

which has to be extended anti-linearly, implementing the boundary constraints.

the composition of the two maps, 2  1 :   , cannot be used as a rigging
map :    because it has the wrong domain as its image. it can, however, easily be
extended to such a map by interpreting  (the labels of functions in ) as v ()   for
a graph  labeling a function in . this leads us to the rigging map

ka = xvv ()a

kv+

: t,k 7(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

by extending anti-linearly. now |k1, . . . , kni is interpreted as a distribution in  analo-
gously to eq. (29):

|k1, . . . , kni (t,k) :=ya

ka,pvv ()a kv.

this rigging map solves both constraints f and c at once by incorporating both delta
expressions. moreover, it is real and positive: (1)(2) = (2)(1) and (1)(1)  0
for 1, 2  . finally,  commutes with physical observables o by construction of the
observables pa and a via p and p:

(1)(o2) = (o1)(2).

the inner product in the solution space () is given by

h(t,k), (t,k)iphys = ((t,k))(t,k) =ya

v .
pvv ()a kv,pvv ()a k

the same properties are fullled for the partial rigging maps 1 and 2 yielding the inner
products (21) and (24).

4 quantum symmetry reduction

the application of the general quantum symmetry reduction scheme to the case treated
here has already been carried out in section 4.2 of ref. [1], and it suces to recall the
main results and to compare with the methods of the present paper.

this framework implements a symmetry reduction procedure at the quantum level,
i.e., the theory is spin network quantized rst followed by singling out symmetric states
which are distributional and represented by one-dimensional spin networks in case of spher-
ical symmetry. the results for spherically symmetric electromagnetism are the following:

17

there is one degree of freedom given by the electric charge. the physical hilbert space is
spanned by states |ki exactly as in the preceding section. recall that in the interpretation
of bf -theory as spherically symmetric electromagnetism there is only one independent
boundary component leading to n = 1 in the formulae above. moreover, the observables
are represented in the same way as derived here yielding the same quantum theory. fur-
thermore, the application of a symmetric spin network state, which is a generalized state
in , on a non-symmetric one

g((b)k)(tk) = g

,kk,(k)

(30)

is reminiscent of the rigging map . here (b)k is a one-dimensional spin network with
charge k in the radial manifold b, g is the magnetic charge, ,k a phase factor, and (k) is
a labeling of a one-dimensional spin network projected from the labeling k which yields for
gauge invariant spin networks the charge (see ref. [1] for details). note however that there
appears no rigging map in that paper: in general there will be no constraint implementing
the symmetry reduction as the constraint f here. therefore, no rigging map, which solves
gauge as opposed to symmetry conditions, is needed.
indeed the methods for tackling
symmetry developed in ref. [1] are quite dierent from those to deal with gauge. the
present paper shows that in the electromagnetic example both these methods apply and
lead to the same quantum theory.

in particular, both approaches manage to reduce the innitely many degrees of freedom

of the non-symmetric eld theory to only one in quite dierent ways.

there are two main advantages of the general method: first, magnetic charge is in-
cluded there from the outset leading to superselection sectors labeled by the magnetic
charge. in the bf -theory approach we could implement magnetic charge by coupling one
in the bf -action. however, this had to be done by hand, whereas all sectors arise directly
in the quantum symmetry reduction. the constraint reduction in spin network quantiza-
tion then had to be performed by evaluating spin network states in connections of the form
a = (g)
is a xed connection with magnetic charge g, leading again
to the same boundary spin networks. the magnetic charge then appears only in a phase
factor which is given by the value of a spin network in the xed connection (g) and which
depends on its geometry (compare eq. (30)).

a + al, where (g)

a

the second, and more important advantage of the quantum symmetry reduction is that
it is a general procedure which applies to any theory with compact and semisimple (up to
u(1)-factors) gauge group and any compact symmetry group (the condition of compactness
can be relaxed). in particular, it applies to symmetry reduction of general relativity in the
real ashtekar formulation (the gauge group being su(2)) which was our main motivation
to develop that procedure.

the treatment in the present article also allows a comparison of spin network techniques
with the standard fock space methods used in ref. [6, 7] in the context of bf -theory. if we
do not impose the surface constraints to provide a more direct comparison with these two
articles, we can use the boundary theory obtained in subsection 3.2.2. the hilbert space
of boundary spin network functions obtained there has some advantages over the fock

18

space quantization: the full group of boundary dieomorphisms can be represented, and
operators creating charge do not have to be normal ordered, but they are well dened from
the outset in the spin network context. thus we see that the spin network representation
is well suited for the kinematical sector of bf -theory.

appendices

a dimensions

in the present article we use electromagnetic dimensions which are unconventional, but
analogous to the geometrical ones used in the gravitational part of the theory. this means
that coordinates as well as the u(1)-connection a are dimensionless. the electric eld
a integrated over a surface yields the enclosed charge, and therefore it should carry the
dimension of electric charge. (we reserve the letters a and e for the respective gravitational
elds, although they will not appear in this paper. for the electromagnetic elds we use
, , and  as in ref. [3].)

a liouville form with the dimension of an action is given by

q

zr

dt d3xaa

where  is a dimensionless constant which xes the norm of the electromagnetic part of
the action, and q is a unit of electric charge providing the correct dimension of an action.
this leads to the symplectic structure

{a(x), b(y)} =


q

b
a(x, y).

(a.1)

up to now we have two constants,  and q, which provide the norm and the dimension,
respectively, of the action. we can x one of them to obtain a theory with only one
undetermined parameter. this will be done by choosing q in such a way that  = q21
becomes a ne structure constant, and thereby the only parameter. this leads to the
commutator [a(x), b(y)] = iqb

a(x, y) in a quantum theory.

b classical reduction

here we recall the main formulae from ref. [3] which are used in the present paper. the
basic elds are the electric eld a with density weight 1 and the u(1)-connection a which

19

are conjugate to one another. the gau constraint reads aa  0. symmetry reduction
is done by imposing the restrictions

and

(x, , ) = ((x, t), 0, 0)

(x, , ) = ((x, t), 0, 0)

(b.2)

(b.3)

in spherical coordinates (x, , ) provided by the given so(3)-action on the spacelike sec-
tion . here we demand that there is no magnetic charge.
if we use the electric ow
p := 4, we obtain the two conjugate elds (, q1p) on a radial manifold subject to the
gau constraint p  0.

for simplicity we restrict  to be simply connected and to be either the wormhole
manifold r  s2, which is the case for a reissner-nordstrm black hole, or r3\{0} =
r+ s2, which simulates the presence of a non-dynamical point charge in the origin. these
manifolds are most interesting in the context of spherical symmetry, but are generalized
slightly in the bf -theory approach. due to simple connectedness and vanishing of the
magnetic eld we have a = al with a function l:   r. symmetry reduction implies
that l is spherically symmetric, i.e., locally constant on the boundary.

after solving the gau constraint, conjugate variables on the reduced phase space are

found to be p, which is constrained to be constant, and  := r dx. the reduced

hamiltonian accounting for boundary dynamics is hred = q1pu with a prescribed func-
tion u(t) which is the value of the lagrange multiplier of the gau constraint at innity.

c u (1)-spin networks

to x our notation we present in this appendix the basic denitions of u(1)-spin networks.
due to abelianess and the simple representation theory of u(1) they are more easy to deal
with than su(2)-spin networks. they also appeared in ref. [9].

the irreducible representations of the abelian u(1) are all one-dimensional and given
by k: u(1)  c, g 7 gk for all k  z. the dual representation of k is given by k, and
the tensor product of two representations is k1  k2 = k1+k2. a u(1)-spin network is a
graph  with a labeling k  (z\{0})e() of its edge set e() with irreducible, non-trivial
u(1)-representations. since the representations are not self-dual, an inverted edge has to
be labeled with the dual representation: ke1 = ke. contrary to the case of su(2)-spin
networks, we do not need contractors in the vertex set v (), because intertwiners of u(1)-
representations are unique up to a constant. if we do not restrict to gauge invariant spin
networks, a coloring of the vertices which determines the transformation of the spin network
under gauge transformations in that vertex can be computed from the edge labeling by

kv =pee() sgn(v, e)ke where v is a vertex of  and sgn(v, e) is dened to be 1 if e is an

edge starting at v, 1 if e ends in v, and 0 otherwise, i.e., if v is not contained in e. given
a graph  with edge labeling k we can form the spin network state as a function on the

20

space of generalized u(1)-connections [8] given by

tk() := yee()

ke((e)),

which transforms under a gauge transformation g:   u(1) by multiplication with the

in all vertices we have kv = 0.

u(1)-element qvv () kv (g(v)). of course, gauge invariant spin networks are obtained if
the basic operators are multiplication by a holonomy e() := exp ire dt eaa along

an edge e which changes the edge labeling by ke 7 ke + 1, and a derivative operator
on u(1). again for u(1) being abelian
which is the invariant vector eld ie(e) := ie
these operators are much simpler than their analogs in su(2). spin network states are
eigenvectors of e(e) with eigenvalue ke: e(e)tk = ketk.
