supersymmetry and dlcq 1

the sdlcq collaboration 2

abstract

in this talk we describe the application of discrete light cone quantization
(dlcq) to supersymmetric eld theories. we nd that it is possible to formulate
dlcq so that supersymmetry is exactly preserved in the discrete approximation
and call this formulation of dlcq, sdlcq. it combines the power of dlcq with
all of the beauty of supersymmetry. we have applied sdlcq to several interesting
supersymmetric theories and discussed zero modes, vacuum degeneracy, massless
states, mass gaps, and theories in higher dimensions. most recently we have used
it to discuss the maldacena conjecture.

1 introduction

in the last decade there have been signicant improvements in our understanding of gauge

theories and important breakthroughs in the nonperturbative description of supersym-

metric gauge theories [24, 25]. in the last few year various relations between string theory,

brane theory and gauge elds [12, 1] have also emerged. while these developments give us

some insight into strongly coupled gauge theories [25], they do not oer a direct method

for non-perturbative calculations. in this talk we discuss some recent developments in

the light cone quantization approach to non-perturbative problems. we have found that

these methods have the potential to expand our understanding of strongly coupled gauge

theories in directions not previously available.

the original idea of light cone quantization was formulated half of a century ago [11],

but apart from several technical clarications [19] it remained mostly undeveloped. the

rst change came in the mid 80s when the discrete light cone quantization (dlcq)

was suggested as a practical way for calculating the masses and wavefunctions of hadrons

[21]. although the direct application of the method to realistic problems meets some

diculties (for review see [9]), dlcq has been successful in studying various two di-

mensional models. given the importance of supersymmetric theories, it is not surprising

that light cone quantization was ultimately applied to such models [16, 6, 7]. in these

early works the mass spectrum was shown to be supersymmetric in the continuum and a

great deal of information about the properties of bound states in supersymmetric theories

was extracted. however the straightforward application of dlcq to the supersymmetric

systems had one disadvantage: the supersymmetry was lost in the discrete formulation.

the way to solve this problem was suggested in [20], where the alternative formula-

tion of dlcq was introduced. namely it was noted that since the supercharge is the

square root of the hamiltonian one can dene a new dlcq procedure based on the

supercharge. we will discuss this formulation (called sdlcq) in this talk.

2

supersymmetric yangmills theory in the light
cone gauge.

we will consider here the bound state problem for various supersymmetric matrix models

in two dimensions. these models may be constructed by dimensional reduction of su-

persymmetric yangmills theory in higher dimensions. before we begin the a discussion

2

of bound state problem for a specic systems it is worthwhile to summarize some basic

ideas of discrete light cone quantization, for a complete review see [9].

let us consider general relativistic systems in two dimensions. in the usual canonical

quantization of such systems one imposes certain commutation relations between coor-

dinates and momenta at equal time. however, as was pointed out by dirac long ago

[11], this is not the only possibility. another scheme of quantization treats the light like
coordinate x+ = 12(x0 + x1) as a new time and then the system is quantized canonically.
this scheme (called light cone quantization) has both positive and negative aspects. the

main disadvantage of light cone quantization is the presence of constraints. even systems

as simple as free bosonic eld has one: from the action

one can derive the constraint relating coordinate and momentum:

s = z d2x+

 = .

(1)

(2)

for more complicated systems the constraints are also present and in general they are

hard to resolve.

the main advantage of the light cone is the decoupling of positive and negative mo-

mentum modes. this property is crucial for dlcq. in the discrete light cone quan-
tization one considers the theory on the nite circle along the x axis: l < x < l.
then all the momenta become quantized and the integer number measuring the total mo-

mentum in terms of elementary momentum is called the harmonic resolution k. due

to the decoupling property one may work only in the sector with positive momenta and

as a result there is a nite number of states for any nite value of resolution. of course
the full quantum eld theory in the continuum corresponds to the limit l  , and in
this limit the elementary bit of momentum goes to zero, as the harmonic resolution goes

to innity and the innite number of degrees of freedom are restored. it is believed that

the quantum mechanical approximation is suitable for describing the lowest states in

the spectrum. note that the problem of constraints in dlcq is a quantum mechanical

one and thus it is easier to solve. usually this problem can be reformulated in terms of

zero modes and the solution can be found for any value of the resolution.

dlcq is mainly used to solve the bound state problem and we will formulate this

problem for a general two dimensional theory. the theory in the continuum has full

poincare symmetry, thus the states are naturally labeled by the eigenvalues of casimir

3

operators of the poincare algebra. one such casimir is the mass operator: m 2 = p p.
another casimir is related to the spin of the particle and is generally not used. after
compactifying the x direction one looses lorentz symmetry, but not the translational
invariance in x+ and x directions. thus p + and p  are still conserved charges, and the
states are characterized by both p + and p . if we consider dlcq as an approximation
to the continuum theory, we anticipate that in the limit of innite harmonic resolution
(or l  ) the full poincare symmetry is restored. thus the aim would be to study the
value of m 2 as function of k and to extrapolate the results to the k = .

the usual way to dene m 2 in dlcq is based on separate calculation of p + and p 

in matrix form and then bringing them together:

m 2 = 2p +p .

(3)

usually one works in the sector with xed p +, but the calculation of light cone hamil-
tonian p  is a nontrivial problem. important simplications occur for supersymmetric
theories [20].

supersymmetry is the only nontrivial extension of poincare algebra compatible with

the existence of an s matrix [26]. namely in addition to usual bosonic generators of

symmetries, fermionic ones are allowed and the full (super)algebra in two dimensions

reads:

} = 2ij 

, qj
{qi
[p, p] = 0,

p + z ij ,
i = 0.
hp, qi

(4)

(5)

in this expression  is the antisymmetric 2  2 matrix, 12 = 1 and z ij is the set of
it is
cnumbers called central charges.
convenient to choose two dimensional gamma matrices in the form:  0 = 2,  1 = i1,
then one can rewrite (4) in terms of light cone components:

in this talk we will put them equal to zero.

i , q+

j } = 22ij p +,
{q+
{qi , qj } = 22ij p ,
i , qj } = 2zij .
{q+

(6)

(7)

(8)

as we mentioned before, in dlcq diagonalization of p + is trivial and the construction
of hamiltonian is the main problem. the last set of equations suggests an alternative

way of dealing with this problem: one can rst construct the matrix representation for

4

the supercharge q and then just square it. this version of dlcq rst suggested in [20]
appeared to be very fruitful. first of all it preserves supersymmetry at nite resolution,

while the conventional dlcq applied to supersymmetric theories doesnt. the super-

symmetric version of dlcq (sdlcq) also provides the better numerical convergence.

to summarize, we have two procedures for studying the bound state spectrum: dlcq

and sdlcq. to implement the rst one we should construct the light cone hamiltonian

and diagonalize it, while the second approach requires the construction of the super-

charge. of course the sdlcq method is appropriate only for the theories with su-

persymmetries, although it can be modied to study models with soft supersymmetry

breaking.

2.1 reduction from three dimensions.

let us start by the dening a simple supersymmetric system in two dimensions. it can

be constructed by dimensional reduction of sym from three to two dimension.

our starting point is the action for sym in 2 + 1 dimensions:

s = z d3xtr(cid:18)

1
4

fabf ab + i ada(cid:19) .

(9)

the system consists of gauge eld aa and twocomponent majorana fermion , both
transforming according to adjoint representation of gauge group. we assume that this
group is either u(n) or su(n) and thus matrices aa
ij and ij are hermitian. studying
dimensional reduction of sy md we introduce the following conventions for the indices:
the capital latin letters correspond to d dimensional spacetime, greek indices label two

dimensional coordinates and the lower case letters are used as matrix indices. according
to this conventions the indexes in (9) go from zero to two, the eld strength fab and
covariant derivative da are dened in the usual way:

fab = aab  baa + ig[aa, ab],
da = a + ig[aa, ].

(10)

dimensional reduction to 1 + 1 means that we require all elds to be independent
on coordinate x2, in other words we place the system on the cylinder with radius l
along the x2 axis and consider only zero modes of the elds. we consider this reduction
as a formal way of getting a two dimensional matrix model. in the reduced theory it is
convenient to introduce two dimensional indices and treat the a2 component of gauge

5

eld as a two dimensional scalar . the action for the reduced theory has the form:

s = z d2x tr(cid:18)

1

f f  +

1
2

dd + i d  2ig 5(cid:19) ,

we choose the special representation of three dimensional gamma matrices:

 0 = 2,

 1 = i1,

 2 = i3,

then it is natural to write the spinor  in terms of its components:

 = (, )t .

(11)

(12)

(13)

taking all these denitions into account one can rewrite the dimensional reduction of (9)

as:

s = lz d2x(cid:18)1
2
+ 2g{, } 

dd + i2d+ + i2d+
ff (cid:19) .

the covariant derivatives here are taken with respect to the light cone coordinates:

x =

x0  x1
2

.

(14)

(15)

note that by rescaling the elds and coupling constant g we can take the constant l to
be equal to one.

the bound state problem for the system (14) was rst studied in [20]. the supersym-

metric version of the discrete light cone quantization was used in order to nd the mass

spectrum, and the zero modes were neglected [20]. we have found that while zero modes

are not very important for calculations of massive spectrum, they play crucial role in the

description of the vacuum of the theory.

let us consider (14) as the theory in the continuum. in this case one can choose the

light cone gauge:

a+ = 0,

then equations of motion for a and  give constraints:

a = gj +,

2i = g[, ],

j +(x) =

i

2{(x), (x)}.

[(x), (x)]

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

solving this constraints and substituting the result back into the action one determines

the lagrangian as function of physical elds  and  only. then using the usual noether

technique, we can construct the conserved charges corresponding to the translational

invariance:

p + = z dxtr(cid:16)()2 + i2(cid:17) ,
p  = z dxtr 
ig2

(21)

we can also construct the noether charges corresponding to the supersymmetry trans-

formation. however the naive susy transformations break the gauge xing condition
a+ = 0, so they should be accompanied by compensating a gauge transformation:

(22)

(23)

(24)

consider now the general reduction of symd to two dimensions. by counting the
fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom one can see that the sym can be dened only

in a limited number of spacetime dimensions, namely d can be equal to 2, 3, 4, 6 or 10.

the last case is the most general one: all other system can be obtained by dimensional

reduction and appropriate truncation of degrees of freedom. so we will concentrate on
the reduction 10  2, and the comments on four and six dimensional cases will be made
in the end.

as in the last subsection we start from ten dimensional action:

s = z d3xtr(cid:18)

1
4

fabf ab + i ada(cid:19) .

(25)

according to our general conventions the indexes in (25) go from zero to nine, 

is the ten dimensional majoranaweyl spinor. a general spinor in ten dimensions has
210/2 = 32 complex components, if the appropriate basis of gamma matrices is chosen

7

then the majorana condition makes all the components real. since all the matrices in

such representation are real, the weyl condition

11 = 

(26)

is compatible with the reality of  and thus it eliminates half of its components. in the

special representation of dirac matrices:

0 = 2  116,
i = i1  i ,
9 = i1   9,

i = 1, . . . , 8;

(27)

(28)

(29)

the 11 = 0    9 has very simple form: 11 = 3  116. then the majorana spinor of
positive chirality can be written in terms of 16component real object :

0!.
 = 21/2 

(30)

let us return to the expressions for  matrices. the ten dimensional dirac algebra

{, } = 2g

is equivalent to the spin(8) algebra for  matrices: {i, j} = 2ij and the ninth matrix
can be chosen to be  9 =  1 . . .  8. note that the 16 dimensional representation of spin(8)
is the reducible one: it can be decomposed as 8s + 8c

i =   0

t
i

i

0 ! ,

i = 1, . . . , 8.

(31)

the explicit expressions for the i satisfying {i , j} = 2ij can be found in [?]. such
choice leads to the convenient form of  9:

 9 =   18

0

0 18 ! .

(32)

so far we have found nonzero components of the spinor given by (30). however as

we saw before not all such components are physical in the light cone gauge, so it is

useful to perform the analog of decomposition (13). in ten dimension it is related with

breaking the sixteen component spinor  on the left and rightmoving components using

the projection operators

pl =

(1   9),

pr =

(1 +  9).

(33)

after introducing the lightcone coordinates x = 12(x0  x9) the action (25) can be
rewritten as

(34)

where the repeated indices i, j are summed over (1, . . . , 8). after applying the lightcone
gauge a+ = 0 one can eliminate nonphysical degrees of freedom using the eulerlagrange
equations for l and a:

i di r,

l =

j + = i[ai , ai] + 22t

a+ = i ai + gj +

(35)

(36)

(37)

performing the reduction to two dimensions means that all elds are assumed to be
independent on the transverse coordinates: i = 0. then as before one can construct
the conserved momenta p  in terms of physical degrees of freedom:

p + = z dxtr(cid:16)(ai)2 + i2rr(cid:17) ,
p  = z dxtr

(39)

we can also construct the noether charges corresponding to the supersymmetry trans-

formation (22). as in the three dimensional case it is convenient to decompose the

supercharge in two components:

q+ = plq,

q = prq.

the resulting eight component supercharges are given by

q = 2gz dxtr j + 1

(41)

finally we make a short comment on dimensional reduction of sy m3+1 and sy m5+1.

these systems can be constructed repeating the procedure just described. however there

9

is an easier way to construct the hamiltonian and supercharges for the dimensionally

reduced theories, namely one has to truncate the unwanted degrees of freedom in the ten

dimensional expressions. this is especially easy for the bosonic coordinates: one simply

considers indices i and j running from one to two (for d = 4) or to four (for d = 6).
the fermionic truncation can also be performed by requiring the spinor r to be 2
or 4component. then the only problem is the choice of 2  2 or 4  4 beta matrices
satisfying

{i , j} = 2ij ,

(42)

which is an easy task.

conclusion.

while we are still far from completely solving the bound state problem in three and four

dimensional theories, we can already make some statements about these theories:

we have studied the structure of bound states for two dimensional supersymmetric

models obtained by dimensional reduction from sym2+1. for this theory we have proven

that any normalizable bound state in the continuum must include a contribution with

arbitrarily large number of partons and we have shown that this is the general property

of supersymmetric matrix models [30]. this scenario is to be contrasted with the simple

bound states discovered in a number of, 1+1 dimensional theories with complex fermions,

such as the schwinger model, the thooft model, and a dimensionally reduced theory

with complex adjoint fermions [5, 22]. we also study the massless states of sym2+1 in

dlcq. some of them are constructed explicitly and the general formula for the number

of massless states as function of harmonic resolution is derived for the large n case [31].

some of our results on zero modes in 2 dimensions are discussed in [3]. they can

be used to describe the vacuum structure of sy m2+1 on a cylinder because only zero

modes contributes to such structures. thus studying the dimensionally reduced theory

in 1 + 1 provides all the necessary information. we found that two dimensional models

also determine the behavior of bound states at weak coupling in three dimensions and

determine the exact number of massless states. we performed such counting only for (1,1)

theory. the theory with (2,2) supersymmetry theory [4] and the even more interesting

case of the (8,8) theory [2], which is known to have a mass gap have not yet been

addressed.

the bound state problem we have studied so far is the traditional one for dlcq.

10

however this is not the only calculation that can be done us this method. the problem

of computing of correlation functions, more traditional for conventional quantum eld

theory, can also be addressed in the light cone quantization. unlike the usual methods

of qft, dlcq calculations are valid beyond perturbation theory and thus can be used

for testing the duality between gauge theory and supergravity.

there has been a great deal of excitement during this past year following the re-

alization that certain eld theories admit concrete realizations as a string theory on a

particular background [17]. by now many examples of this type of correspondence for

eld theories in various dimensions with various eld contents have been reported in the

literature (for a comprehensive review and list of references, see [1]). however, attempts

to apply these correspondences to study the details of these theories have only met with

limited success so far. the problem stems from the fact that our understanding of both

sides of the correspondence is limited. on the eld theory side, most of what we know

comes from perturbation theory where we assume that the coupling is weak. on the string

theory side, most of what we know comes from the supergravity approximation where

the curvature is small. there are no known situations where both approximations are

simultaneously valid. at the present time, comparisons between the dual gauge/string

theories have been restricted to either qualitative issues or quantities constrained by

symmetry. any improvement in our understanding of eld theories beyond perturbation

theory or string theories beyond the supergravity approximation is therefore a welcome

development.

we have studied the eld theory/string theory correspondence [27] motivated by

considering the near-horizon decoupling limit of a d1-brane in type iib string theory [15].

the gauge theory corresponding to this theory is the yang-mills theory in two dimensions

with 16 supercharges.

its sdlcq formulation was recently reported in [2]. this is

probably the simplest known example of a eld theory/string theory correspondence

involving a eld theory in two dimensions with a concrete lagrangian formulation.

a convenient quantity that can be computed on both sides of the correspondence is

the correlation function of gauge invariant operators [13, 29]. we focused on two point

functions of the stress-energy tensor. this turns out to be a very convenient quantity

to compute for many reasons. some aspects of this as it pertains to a consideration of

black hole entropy was recently discussed in [14]. there are other physical quantities

often reported in the literature.

in the dlcq literature, the spectrum of hadrons is

often reported. this would be ne for theories in a conning phase. however, we expect

11

the sym in two dimension to ow to a non-trivial conformal xed point in the infra-red

[15, 10]. the spectrum of states will therefore form a continuum and will be cumbersome

to handle. on the string theory side, entropy density [8] and the quark anti-quark

potential [8, 23, 18] are frequently reported. the denition of entropy density requires

that we place the eld theory in a space-like box which seems incommensurate with

the discretized light cone. similarly, a static quark anti-quark conguration does not t

very well inside a discretized light-cone geometry. the correlation function of point-like

operators do not suer from these problems.

let us now mention the immediate challenges to dlcq following from our consider-

ation. first of all it is straightforward to extend the numerical results for the correlator

to higher resolution and thus to test the maldacena conjecture. the only problem here

is the limits in ones computing resources. the better computer power may also help to

extend our analysis of three dimensional system to larger values of transverse truncation

and it might be possible to extrapolate the results to continuum. the simple trans-

verse truncation we have used so far do not provide much information about behavior

of the spectrum as function of transverse resolution. another serious disadvantage of

our approach is that we study the theory on the cylinder and thus the structure of the

topological excitations of our system diers from the one of sym2+1 in innite spacetime.

such excitations can become important in the strong coupling limit. however, even the

spectrum for the theory on the cylinder is of a great interest and we leave the detailed

numerical study of this system for future work. finally solving for bound states of four

dimensional theories is still the greatest challenge for dlcq.

in this talk we have reviewed some of the progress in the application of discrete light

cone quantization to the supersymmetric systems. studying such systems is especially

interesting because the cancellation between bosonic and fermionic loops make these

theories much easier to renormalize than models without supersymmetry. although we

didnt need this advantage when considering two dimensional systems, it becomes crucial

in higher dimensions. from this point of view it is desirable to have exact susy in

discretized theories to simplify the renormalization in dlcq.
