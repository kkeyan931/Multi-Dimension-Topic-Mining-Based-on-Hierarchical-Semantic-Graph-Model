abstract

we study heterotic vacua with four supercharges in three and four space-time di-
mensions and their duals obtained as m/f-theory compactied on calabi-yau fourfolds.
we focus on their respective moduli spaces and derive the kahler potential for heterotic
vacua obtained as circle compactications of four-dimensional n = 1 heterotic theories.
the kahler potential of the dual theory is computed by compactifying 11-dimensional
supergravity on calabi-yau fourfolds. the duality between these theories is checked for
k3-bred fourfolds and an appropriate f-theory limit is discussed.

1 introduction

the e8  e8 heterotic string has been the prime candidate for providing a string theo-
retic version of the (supersymmetric) standard model for over a decade. in particular,
the vacuum solutions with 4 minkowskian space-time dimensions (d = 4) and n = 1
supersymmetry have been extensively studied due to their phenomenological prospects.
however, despite considerable eorts a number of (serious) problems remain within the
framework of the perturbative heterotic string such as a missing mechanism for hierar-
chical supersymmetry breaking and the stabilization of the dilaton.

with the advent of string dualities two things have changed. on the one hand it has
been possible to control some of the non-perturbative properties (or couplings) of string
theory [1]. on the other hand the so(32) heterotic string and even more so the type i
string have been investigated from the point of view of viable particle phenomenology [2].

in this paper we continue to focus on n = 1 vacua of the heterotic string but include
their circle compactications to d = 3 into our considerations. the reason is that in
d = 3 the vector multiplet contains a real scalar in the adjoint representation of the
heterotic gauge group and thus  contrary to the situation in d = 4  a coulomb branch
exists. some of the non-perturbative features of these vacua are believed to be captured
by f-theory compactied on elliptic calabi-yau fourfolds y4 or m-theory compactied
on y4 for the three-dimensional case [341].

the purpose of this paper is to facilitate a comparison of the corresponding eective
lagrangians and in particular the identication of those m/f-theory vacua which have
a perturbative heterotic limit. in our analysis we ignore all charged matter multiplets
and only focus on the moduli which are constrained by supersymmetry to parameterize
a kahler manifold [42, 43]. we derive the kahler potential for the moduli of a calabi-
yau fourfold in the large volume limit of m-theory including the moduli coming from
the three-form potential and compare it to the kahler potential of the corresponding
heterotic vacua. in spirit our analysis is very close to a similar analysis carried out for
the duality of type iia on a calabi-yau threefold y3 and the heterotic string on k3t 2
in refs. [44, 45].

the organisation of the paper is as follows. in section 2 (and appendix b) we start
with a general eective supergravity lagrangian in n = 1, d = 4 which can be obtained
by compactications of the heterotic string on an appropriate (0,2) superconformal eld
theory4 and perform a kaluza-klein reduction to d = 3 on a circle. we derive the three-
dimensional kahler potential in terms of the four-dimensional one and an additional
term coming from the four-dimensional vector elds. in section 3 (and appendix c) we
compactify 11-dimensional supergravity on a calabi-yau fourfold with vanishing euler
number ( = 0) and vanishing four-form ux. we derive the kahler potential for the
moduli which include the geometrical moduli arising as deformations of the kahler class
and complex structure of the fourfold as well as the moduli coming from the expansion
of the m-theory three-form. the m-theory kahler potential is compared to the heterotic
kahler potential in section 4. we show that for fourfolds which are k3-brations over
a complex two-dimensional base b2 the two kahler potentials agree in the limit of large

4this includes in particular compactications on calabi-yau threefolds y3 with a choice of the gauge

bundle.

b2 and weak heterotic coupling. finally, the f-theory limit is discussed.

section 5 contains our conclusions and appendix a assembles notation and conven-

tions. a preliminary version of some of our results was given in [46].

2 heterotic string vacua

2.1 d = 4, n = 1 heterotic vacua

our starting point is a generic eective supergravity lagrangian in d = 4 with n = 1 su-
persymmetry. such vacua can be constructed as compactications of the heterotic string
on calabi-yau threefolds y3 or more generally from appropriate (0, 2) superconformal
eld theories. for the purpose of this paper it is sucient to focus only on the vector
multiplets and the chiral moduli multiplets and ignore all charged matter multiplets. the
eective lagrangian in this case reads [47]5

l(4) =

r(4)  g(4)
2

,

ij (, )m  i mj

refab()f a

mnf bmn +

4

imfab()f a
mn

f bmn

(1)

where m, n = 0, . . . , 3, i are the moduli elds and f a
mn is the eld strength of the
gauge bosons aa
m. the index a labels the generators of the gauge group g and thus
a = 1, . . . , dim(g). n = 1 supersymmetry requires that the fab() are holomorphic
functions of the moduli which are further constrained by gauge invariance. the metric
g(4)

ij has to be a kahler metric, that is

ij =  ij k (4)(, ) ,
g(4)

(2)

where k (4) is the kahler potential.

perturbative heterotic string theory imposes further constraints on the functions k (4)
and fab. first of all the rank r of the gauge group g is bounded by the central charge c of
the left moving (bosonic) conformal eld theory on the worldsheet. for heterotic strings
in d = 4 one has c = 22 and hence

r(g)  22.

(3)

secondly, the holomorphic fab are universal at the string tree level and determined by the
heterotic dilaton 4 and the axion a which is the (poincare) dual of the antisymmetric
tensor bmn. the two scalars are combined into a complex s = 2

4 + ia and one has

fab = kasab + . . . ,

(4)

where k is the level of the kac-moody algebra. the . . . denote perturbative and non-
perturbative quantum corrections which are suppressed in the large s (weak coupling)
limit; they play no role in this paper.

5we neglect the possibility of anomalous u (1) gauge factors with appropriate four-dimensional green-

schwarz terms.

2

the metric of the moduli also simplies at the string tree level. using the notation

i = (s, i) with i = 1, . . . , n4, i = 0, . . . , n4 one has

k (4) =  ln(s + s) + k (4)(, ) + . . . ,

(5)

where k (4)(, ) is the tree level kahler potential for all moduli but the dilaton. it is
a model dependent function and does not enjoy any generic properties. for calabi-yau
compactications with the standard embedding of the spin connection (so called (2, 2)
vacua) k (4) splits into a sum

k (4) = k (4)

1,1 + k (4)
2,1 ,

(6)

1,1 (k (4)

where k (4)
2,1 ) is the kahler potential for the (1, 1)-moduli ((2, 1)-moduli) of y3. for
future reference we also need to recall that in the large volume limit of calabi-yau
compactications k (4)

1,1 is given by [48, 49]

k (4)
1,1 =  ln[dabc(t + t)a(t + t)b(t + t)c] =  ln[vol(y3)] ,

(7)

where dabc are the (classical) intersection numbers, ta the (1, 1)-moduli and vol(y3) is
the classical volume of the compactication manifold y3. for k (4)
2,1 one has instead [49,50]

k (4)

2,1 =  lnhzy3

  i ,

(8)

where  is the unique (3, 0)-form.6

finally, let us note that the couplings of the dilaton in eqs. (4) and (5) are largely
determined by the fact that 4 organizes the string perturbation theory and that in
perturbation theory there is a continuous peccei-quinn (pq) symmetry s  s+i,   r
shifting the axion a.

2.2 d = 4, n = 1 supergravity compactied on s1

let us reduce the lagrangian (1) to d = 3 on a circle s1. this does not break any
supercharges so that the theory continues to have 4 real supercharges. in d = 3 this
corresponds to n = 2 supersymmetry since the irreducible majorana spinor has 2 real
components.

for the s1-reduction to d = 3 we use the ansatz [52]:

g(4)

mn =(cid:18) g(3)

 + r2bb

r2b

r2b

r2 (cid:19) ,

aa

m =(cid:0)aa

 + b a,  a(cid:1) ,

(9)

where ,  = 0, 1, 2 and r is the radius (measured in the d = 4 einstein metric) of the
s1. the reduction procedure follows closely ref. [52] where four-dimensional n = 2 vacua
are considered. the details for the reduction of n = 1 vacua are shown in appendix b
and here we only give the results.

in d = 3 the vector multiplets contain the real scalars  a in the adjoint representation
of g. thus there is an additional component of the moduli space (a coulomb branch)

6k (4)

2,1 has a similar expansion as k (4)

1,1 around the large complex structure point [51].

3

spanned by the scalar elds lying in the cartan subalgebra of g and at a generic point
in this moduli space the gauge group is [u(1)]r(g). in order to make the notation not
too heavy we continue to label the u(1) gauge multiplets by the index a although in
the previous section the same index ran over all gauge generators; thus a = 1, . . . , r(g)
henceforth.

in d = 3 an abelian vector is (poincare) dual to a scalar and thus a vector multiplet is
dual to a chiral multiplet. technically this duality is seen by adding lagrange multipliers
c a, b to the three-dimensional lagrangian and eliminating aa
, b by their equations of
motion (see appendix b). in this dual picture all supermultiplets are chiral and thus their
scalar elds have to parametrize a kahler manifold [43]. it turns out that the kahler
structure only becomes manifest after introducing the coordinates

da  fab() b + ic a ,
t  r2 + ib +
(ref )1

ab ()da(db + db) .

(10)

combining all n4+r(g)+2 scalar elds into the coordinate vector z  = (s, i, da, t ),  =
0, . . . , n4 + r(g) + 1 the three-dimensional lagrangian can be written as

l(3) =

1
2

r(3)  g  z z  ,

(11)

where g  obeys

g  = k (3)

k (3)
het = k (4)(, )  ln[t + t 

1
2

(d + d)a(ref )1

ab (d + d)b] .

(12)

note that the argument of the logarithm is given by the square of the compactication
radius, as can be seen from eq. (10):

t + t 

1
2

(d + d)a(ref )1

ab (d + d)b = 2r2 .

(13)

2.3 the heterotic d = 3 low energy eective lagrangian

so far the reduction did not use any input from string theory but was merely an exercise
in supergravity. inserting the string tree level properties displayed in eqs. (4) and (5)
into k (3)

het of eq. (12) yields

k (3)

het = k (4)(, )  ln(cid:2)(t + t )(s + s)  (da + da)2(cid:3) .

(14)

we will see in section 4 that in the dual m-theory vacua we are more naturally led to
the coordinates s = 1

2 (s + t ) and t  = 1

2(s  t ) and the kahler potential
het = k (4)(, )  ln[(s + s)2  (t  + t )2  (da + da)2] .
k (3)

(15)

the next step is to identify the three-dimensional dilaton. the relation to the 4-di-

mensional dilaton is as usually

1

=

rs

4

,

4

(16)

where rs is the radius of s1 measured in the four-dimensional string frame metric. in the
reduction procedure we used the metric in the einstein frame (eq. (9)) which is related
to the metric in the string frame by the weyl rescaling g(4)
str. this implies the
following relation among the radii

e = 2

4 g(4)

combining (16) and (17) results in

rs = r4 .

using (13) and 2

4 = 1

2(s + s) we also derive

3 =

3 = (t + t )(s + s)  (da + da)2 .

(17)

(18)

(19)

the three-dimensional dilaton governs the perturbation series in d = 3, as can be seen
by reducing the four-dimensional lagrangian in the string frame. the result can be found
in appendix b. the kahler potential of eq. (14) is only valid to lowest order in r and 3
and gets perturbative and non-perturbative corrections.

finally let us discuss the symmetries of the compactied theory. first of all there is
the pq associated with the four-dimensional axion a discussed in section 2.1. further-
more, there are r(g) + 1 abelian gauge symmetries associated with the r(g) + 1 gauge
bosons aa
, b. in the dual lagrangian these symmetries appear as continuous pq sym-
metries acting on the dual scalars. finally, the scalars  a in the three-dimensional vector
multiplets inherit another pq symmetry from the four-dimensional gauge invariance.
so altogether (11), (12) are invariant under the following 2r(g) + 2 pq symmetries (with
parameters , , a, a)

a  a +  ,
b  b +  ,
c a  c a + a ,
 a   a + a ,

b  b + a a ,
b  b + ac a .

(20)

these pq symmetries are exact in perturbation theory but broken to discrete subgroups
non-perturbatively. in addition, there is the standard t-duality which acts on the radius
of the s1 and sends rs  r1
s while keeping 3 xed. using (17) and (18) this corresponds
to

4  r1 ,

r  1

4

,

(21)

and also leaves (14) invariant.

3 m-theory compactied on calabi-yau fourfolds

m-theory has been suggested as the strong coupling limit of type iia string theory [53].
even though a satisfactory formulation of m-theory has not been established its low
energy limit is known to be 11-dimensional supergravity. in this section we perform the

5

compactication of this low energy limit on calabi-yau fourfolds and obtain an eective
lagrangian in d = 3.

the starting point is the 11-dimensional supergravity lagrangian7 [54]:

11l(11) =

2

r(11) 

1
4|f4|2 

1
12

(g(11))1/2a3  f4  f4 ,

(22)

where a3 is a three-form, f4 its eld strength and g(11) the determinant of the 11-
dimensional metric (more details of the notation used are given in appendix a). the
lagrangian (22) is the leading order contribution in a derivative expansion p/mp l where
p is the characteristic fourier momentum. the next term in this expansion has been
deduced from a one-loop computation in the type iia theory [55] and then extrapolated
to the 11-dimensional theory.
it is associated to the sigma-model anomaly of the 6-
dimensional vebrane worldvolume [56]. it reads

(in the following we set 11 = 1.)

in order to do the reduction of (22) let us recall a few facts about calabi-yau four-
folds y4 [18]. they are ricci-at kahler manifolds of complex dimension four with
su(4) holonomy. the massless modes of the three-dimensional theory are determined
by the non-trivial harmonic forms on y4 which are the elements of the cohomology groups
h p,q(y4). the dimensions hp,q of h p,q satisfy

hp,0 = h0,p = h4,p = hp,4 = 0 ,

p = 1, 2, 3 ,

h0,0 = h4,4 = h4,0 = h0,4 = 1 ,

h1,2 = h2,1 = h3,2 = h2,3,

h1,1 = h3,3,
h2,2 = 2(22 + 2h1,1 + 2h1,3  h1,2) ,

(24)

h1,3 = h3,1 ,

leaving h1,1, h1,2, h1,3 arbitrary. an important further constraint arises from compactica-
tion of the term (23). it induces a potential tadpole term for the three-form a3 rendering
the resulting vacuum inconsistent [8]. the cocient of the anomaly is set by the euler
number  of y4

x8 = 


24

zy4

1
4

= 

(8 + h1,1 + h1,3  h1,2) .

(25)

thus it can be avoided by choosing compactication manifolds with  = 0. however,
the anomaly can also be cancelled by considering backgrounds with n space-time lling
membranes or turning on non-trival f4-ux [7, 8, 17].8 in this case

(26)

7the corresponding action is given by s(11) =r d11xpg(11)l(11). throughout the paper we dene
the lagrangian without the factor pg(d).

8a further contribution to the anomaly related to m5-branes wrapped around three-cycles in the

calabi-yau has been discussed in [13].

has to hold for consistency. backgrounds with space-time lling membranes are known
to be dual to heterotic vacua in non-trivial 5-brane backgrounds [20,26,41]. since we are
primarily interested in identifying the perturbative heterotic string among the fourfold
compactications we choose to consider n = 0 in this paper. furthermore, nontrival f4-
ux corresponds in the heterotic dual to discrete twists of the gauge bundle [20,30,40] and
can lead to nontrivial torsion [39, 57]. we will analyze this case in a future publication
which leaves us with fourfolds that satisfy  = 0 as the compactication manifolds to
consider in the following.

we now perform a lowest order kaluza-klein reduction of the 11-dimensional super-

gravity on calabi-yau fourfolds.9 for the 11-dimensional metric we take the ansatz

g(11)

m n (x, y) =  g(3)

0

 (x)

0

ab (x, y) ! ,

g(8)

(27)

where x( = 0, 1, 2) denote the coordinates of three-dimensional minkowski space and
ya(a = 3, . . . , 10) denote the internal calabi-yau coordinates. in addition g(8)
ab depends on
a set of moduli m which parameterize the possible deformations of g(8)
ab compatible with
the calabi-yau condition. these moduli appear as massless scalar elds in the three-
dimensional eective action parameterizing at directions of the eective potential. in
the compactication procedure one chooses an arbitrary point in this moduli space (this
corresponds to choosing an arbitrary set of vacuum expectation values for the scalar
elds) and expands in the innitesimal neighborhood of this point m = hmi + m(x).
this induces
ab (hmi, m(x)) ,
(28)
its deformation. demanding that g(8)
where g(8)
ab
ab
preserves the calabi-yau condition one can expand it in terms of non-trivial harmonic
forms on y4. it is convenient to introduce complex coordinates j (j = 1, . . . , 4) for y4

9a similar analysis for iia compactications on threefolds can be found in ref. [58] while compacti-

cation of 11-dimensional supergravity on threefolds was considered in ref. [59, 60].
10the corresponding integration measures are related according to d8  d4  d4  = d8y.
11in the following we omit the superscript (8) at the internal metric.

in the following it is convenient to dene a metric independent of m a as

(40)

where ca are constant real vectors with no vanishing entries but otherwise arbitrary.

it is important to notice is that gab and dabcd are independent of the complex
structure but gi j and dai j do depend on z  and z . this dependence is not known
generically since it depends on the particular y4 under consideration. however, as we
will show it is not necessary to know the complex structure dependence of gi j and dai j
explicitly in order to determine the kahler potential.13

the basis i of (2, 1)-forms can locally be chosen to depend holomorphically on the

complex structure or in other words

 z i = 0 ,

z i 6= 0 .

(41)

since h3,0 = h0,3 = 0 the derivative z i can be expanded into (1, 2)- and (2, 1)-forms
with complex-structure dependent coecient functions  and 

z i = ik(z, z) k + i l(z, z)  l .

(42)

note that  is not the complex conjugate of  but an independent function. dierenti-
ating (42) with respect to z  results in the following dierential constraints for  and


 z  ik = i l   lk ,

 z  i k = i l   l k .

(43)

from (38), (39), (40) and (42) it immediatly follows that the complex structure depen-
dence of gi j , gi j, dai j is constrained by the dierential equations14

z gi j = ikgk j ,

z  gi j = ik gk j ,

z dai j = ik dak j .

(44)

the next step is to insert eqs. (27)-(32) into (22). the details of this reduction are
presented in appendix c and here we only summarize the results. the vectors aa
 are
again dualized to scalar elds denoted by p a. so after dualization the vector multiplet
becomes a chiral multiplet with the (real) scalars (m a, p a) and there are altogether
h1,1 + h1,2 + h1,3 chiral multiplets. supersymmetry requires that the lagrangian of these
chiral multiplets must be expressable in the form

l(3) =

1
2

r(3)  g  z z  ,

(45)

where ,  = 1, . . . , h1,1 + h1,2 + h1,3 and g  is a kahler metric g  = k (3)
m .
however, it turns out that the scalar elds which appear naturally in eqs. (29)-(32)
in the expansion of the harmonic forms on y4 are not the appropriate kahler coordi-
nates z . rather a set of eld redenitions has to be performed in order to cast the

finally let us discuss the continuous pq-symmetries of the m-theory vacua in the
large volume limit. first of all the scalars p a which arise from dualizing the vectors aa

inherit a pq-symmetry from gauge invariance. the kahler potential (49) is invariant
under the shifts

p a  p a + a ,

where a are arbitrary real constants. secondly, the n i arise from expanding the three-
form in eq. (32) and as a consequence they inherit part of the three-form gauge invari-
ance. specically, the three-dimensional lagrangian is invariant under the shift

n i i + n i  i  n i i + n i  i + const. .

in terms of n i this amounts to

n i  n i + i(z, z) ,

n i  n i +  i(z, z) ,

(58)

where the i depend on the complex structure and as a consequence of (42) have to

 z  j =  i   ij .

4 duality

4.1 heterotic  m-theory duality in d = 3

the next step is to investigate the dual relation between the heterotic and the m-theory
vacua. a rst guidance can be obtained by considering the 7-dimensional duality (m/k3

b2 one can apply the adiabatic argument [62] and conclude that m-theory compactied on
a k3-bred fourfold should be dual to the heterotic string compactied on an elliptically
bred threefold. the 7-dimensional string coupling constant 7 is related to the volume
vk3 of the k3 measured in the (11-dimensional) m-theory metric and the respective
space-time metrics (ghet

(65)

where the volume of the base b2 measured in the heterotic string frame metric vhet
is related to the volume vb2 measured in the m-theory metric via vhet
7 vb2 as
can bee seen from eq. (64). eq. (65) implies that a large volume of the calabi-yau
fourfold corresponds to heterotic weak coupling. since the compactication of m-theory
performed in the previous section is valid for large fourfolds it is legitimate to compare
it to a weakly coupled heterotic string. or in other words the two limits  large y4 in m-
theory and weak coupling in the heterotic string  are mutually compatible. in particular
duality requires that the respective kahler potentials have to agree in this limit

(66)

for perturbative heterotic vacua where k (3)
het is given by eq. (12) the equality between
the kahler potentials is not automatically satised but rather puts a constraint on the
intersection numbers dabcd or more generally on the calabi-yau fourfold. it would be
desirable to nd those fourfolds which correspond to a perturbative heterotic vacuum
exactly as was done in ref. [45] for type iia compactied on calabi-yau threefolds. in
this paper we only make the rst step in this direction in that we show that for the (1, 1)
moduli of k3-bred fourfolds eq. (66) holds in the large base limit.

as the base b2 we take in both theories a hirzebruch surface fn with n even and freeze
the values of the scalars n i, z  on the m-theory side. in this case the m-theory kahler
potential simplies k (3)
m = k1,1, where k1,1 is given in eq. (55). the particular geometry
of the calabi-yau fourfold we are considering aects the form of its intersection numbers
and thus in view of (c.32) also the form of gab. but (c.32) determines gab in terms
of the coordinates m a. in order to nd a map between the heterotic and the m-theory
variables one has to compare the kahler potentials expressed in the kahler coordinates.
in general it is not possible to invert (46) and explicitly express m a (and thus gab) in
terms of the t a. however, as we will see shortly the explicit relation between m a and
t a can be obtained in the large base limit.

in this limit the intersection numbers of y4 enjoy specic properties. we therefore need
to know the group of its divisors16, i.e. h6(y4). let  : y4  b2 denote the projection
map of the k3 bred fourfold. one has three dierent contributions to h6(y4):

16a similar analysis for k3 bred threefolds can be found in section 5.5 of [63].

12

1. each divisor c of the base b2 contributes a divisor d of y4 via its pullback

d = c.

2. each monodromy invariant algebraic 2-cycle gi in the generic bre f0 gives

a divisor di of y4 if it is transported around the base.

3. when the k3 bre degenerates over a locus of codimension one in the base
in such a way that the degenerate bre is reducible, the volumes of its com-
ponents can be varied independently. therefore such reducible bad bres
ba contribute further elements to h6(y4).

the intersection of two divisors of the rst kind can be traced back to the intersection

of the corresponding divisors in the base:

(d1  d2)y4 = (c1  c2)y4 = (c1  c2)b2,

(67)

which is not a number, but a four-cycle in the calabi-yau fourfold. the subscript in-
dicates the space within which we are considering the intersection theory. as explained
in [4] fn (with n even) is topologically the product of two s2s, whose areas are the two
kahler parameters u and v . the corresponding divisors cu and cv have the intersec-
tion numbers (cu  cu )b2 = (cv  cv )b2 = 0 and (cu  cv )b2 = 1. in view of (67) the
intersections of the two related divisors of the fourfold are either zero or the generic bre,
i.e. (du  du )y4 = 0, (dv  dv )y4 = 0 and (du  dv )y4 = f0. from this fact follows that
the intersection of three and four du , dv automatically vanishes and that du  dv has
no intersection with divisors coming from bad bres ba. finally, we have

(du  dv  di  dj)y4 = (gi  gj)f0,

(68)

where gi, gj and di, dj are dened in the second entry of the list above. in particular
gi and gj are dual to elements of the (monodromy invariant) part of the picard lattice
of the generic bre which has signature (+,, . . . ,) [63]. thus it is possible to choose
the divisors of f0 in a way that the right hand side of (68) is given by ij = (+,, . . . ,).
in the large base limit the (rescaled) volume v = 1
4! dabcd m a m b m c m d is domi-
nated by those terms which contain a maximal number of base moduli. from what we
have just said it is clear that the leading contribution is

v =

1
2

du v ij u v m i m j =

1
2

u v ij m i m j,

(69)

where u v is the (rescaled) volume of the base and 1
2ij m i m j that of the generic bre.
obviously we are in an adiabatic regime, in which to leading order the volume is given by
the product of the base and bre volumes vy4 = vb2
vk3. using the intersection numbers
(69) and (c.32) we can compute gab for the moduli u and v of the base and the moduli
m i of the generic bre in the large base limit17

17at this point we neglect the possibility of moduli arising from bad bres and discuss their contribution

at the end of the section.

.

in connection with (69) this implies

v = 32(t u + t u )(t v + t v )(t i + t i)ij(t j + t j) .

(71)

(72)

thus in the large b2 limit the volume also factorizes in the kahler coordinates t a. the
m-theory kahler potential reads in this limit

k (3)

m =  ln v =  lnh(t u + t u )(t v + t v )(t i + t i)ij(t j + t j)i ,

and can now be compared to the k (3)

het of the heterotic vacua specied in eq. (15).

(73)

on the heterotic side we take the large base limit together with the large s-limit
(weak four-dimensional coupling). thus only s, t , da and the (1,1) moduli u, v of the
base b2 have to be taken into account while all other (1,1) moduli, all (2,1) and all
gauge bundle moduli can be frozen at generic values. in elliptically bred threefolds y3
with the hirzebruch surface fn as a base the kahler potential of u and v simplies to
k (4) =  ln[(u + u )(v + v )] [4, 64]. so altogether we have on the heterotic side
k (3)
het =  ln[(u + u)(v + v )]  ln[(s + s)2  (t  + t )2  (da + da)2] .

(74)

the two kahler potentials agree if one identies

(s, t , da)  (t i) ,

(u, v )  (t u , t v ) .

(75)

we see that the moduli which parameterize the base b2 are identied on both sides and
the (1, 1) moduli of the generic k3-bre on the m-theory side are identied with the
four-dimensional dilaton, the radius of s1 and the scalars da related to the heterotic
vector multiplets. note that the correspondence (75) implies according to eq. (19) and
(71)

3  (t i + t i)ij(t j + t j)  vb2 = vb2v,
4

(76)

which agrees with (65) obtained in the adiabatic regime. furthermore the number of
moduli t i on the m-theory side is bounded by the maximal rank of the picard group
of the generic bre, i.e. by h(1,1)(f0) = 20. this is consistent with the bound on the
heterotic gauge group given in (3). in fact it is a little lower but that could be related to
the fact that our analysis is based on purely classical geometry. (the same issue arises
in type iia vacua compactied on threefolds [45].)

so far we neglected moduli arising from reducible bad k3 bres in the fourfold, i.e.
we considered no divisors of the third kind. in the context of the duality between the

14

heterotic string compactied on k3  t 2 and the type iia string on k3-bred y3 the
reducible bad k3 bres were shown to be related to non-perturbative physics on the
heterotic side [45]. the same is true for m- and f-theory compactications on k3-bred
threefolds y3 [4, 5]. for those k3-bred fourfolds y4 which can be adiabatically obtained
as k3-bred threefolds over p1 it follows that the reducible bad k3 bres also correspond
to non-perturbative physics on the heterotic side [33]. this can be explicitly checked in
the kahler potentials [65]. finally, the identication of the (2, 1) and (3, 1) moduli of
y4 with the elliptic bre, the (2, 1) and the bundle moduli of y3 on the heterotic side is
discussed in refs. [20, 21, 25, 30, 33].

4.2 f-theory limit

ultimately, one is interested in lifting the m-theory/heterotic duality discussed so far
to four space-time dimensions. this amounts to a simple decompactication on the
heterotic side while in the dual theory one has to take the f-theory limit [3]. the
following discussion of the f-theory limit is strongly inspired by ref. [63] where a similar
decompactication limit is discussed in the context of type iia/heterotic duality in four
dimensions.

taking the f-theory limit requires that the calabi-yau fourfold is elliptically bred.
here we focus on those fourfolds which are in addition k3-bred. thus the f-theory limit
for this restricted class of fourfolds requires k3-bres which themselves are elliptically
bred over a base p1. the rst step is to blow down any rational curves in the generic
k3-bre which take the picard number above its minimal value of 2. (the two moduli
which are always present arise from the base p1 and the elliptic bre.) the map (75)
implies that on the heterotic side this corresponds to freezing the scalars corresponding
to the real part of da.18 after blowing down the picard lattice is given by the even
self-dual lattice 1,1, which we supose to be generated by the null vector v and its dual
v. the kahler form of the generic k3-bre is given by

j =r 1

2

v +r 

2

v ,

  r+ ,

(77)

where the coecients have been chosen such that the volume of the generic bre in m-
theory units is of order one. as we are only interested in the qualitative features of the
f-theory limit we do not keep track of any constants of order one in the following. the
class of the base of the k3 is given by v  v (having self-intersection number 2) and
the class of the elliptic bre by v (with self-intersection number 0). the choice du v ij =
ij = (+,, . . . ,) in our previous discussion corresponds to choosing the divisors of the
generic k3-bre in such a way that the forms representing the cohomology classes of the
poincare duals of these divisors are given by a = 1
(v  v). one
2
veries that they obey a.a = 1, b.b = 1 and a.b = 0. (a.a  rk3 a  a, etc.)

expanded in this basis the kahler form of the generic k3-bre (77) is given by

(v + v) and b = 1
2

18strictly speaking we should rst undo the duality transformation which related the three-dimensional
vector multiplets to chiral multiplets since in the f-theory limit the four-dimensional vector multiplets
(which have no scalar) have to be recovered.

5 conclusions

in this paper we derived the kahler potentials for the three-dimensional perturbative
heterotic string (in terms of the four-dimensional one) and the kahler potential for the
moduli of a calabi-yau fourfold in the large volume limit of m-theory including the
moduli coming from the three-form potential. we showed that both have a common
range of validity (weak heterotic coupling and large volume of the fourfold are compatible
with each other) and that they do agree for k3-bred fourfolds and elliptic threefolds in
the large base limit.

it would be desirable to generalize this analysis and determine all fourfolds which
obey eq. (66). moreover, our analysis was restricted to fourfolds with vanishing euler
number ( = 0) corresponding to the absence of space-time lling membranes and non-
trivial four-form ux. incorporating such eects requires the presence of a non-trivial
warp factor in the ansatz for the metric (27) [7].

perturbative quantum corrections on the heterotic side which correct the gauge kinetic
function fab and the kahler potential can be taken into account and related to geomet-
rical corrections on the m-theory side. in this manner one might derive a geometrical
version of the heterotic perturbation expansion [65]. in particular, the holomorphic f -
function has to be related to holomorphic quantities of the fourfold. closely related
is the issue of non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential which corresponds to
wrapping m5-branes over appropriate six-cycles in the fourfold [6].

16

finally, in d = 2 the duals of the heterotic vacua are related to iia compactied on
y4. this duality might be used to leave the regime of large y4 and compute stringy ()
corrections. similarly, issues of mirror symmetry in calabi-yau fourfolds can be studied.

the fact, that we do not get an overall factor 2
is an artefact of the dualisation of

the antisymmetric tensor in d = 4. we see that the perturbation series is governed by
the three-dimensional dilaton (18) which also determines the three-dimensional gauge
couplings. notice however, that the gauge coupling for the kaluza-klein vector b also
depends on the elds rs and  a. dualizing the vectors again yields

19it is essential for this to work that fab depends holomorphically on the moduli elds, ensuring the

20we have used the tree level form of the gauge kinetic functions (4) in this formula and inserted

i = (s, i).

c dimensional reduction of d = 11 supergravity on

calabi-yau fourfolds

in this appendix we present some of the technical details connected to the dimensional
reduction of the 11-dimensional supergravity lagrangian (22) on calabi-yau fourfolds.
starting from the ansatz (27) one considers innitesimally small deformations of the met-
ric, (29) and (30), which preserve the calabi-yau condition. these metric deformations
correspond to variations of the kahler class and the complex structure of the calabi-yau
metric. to lowest order they can be deduced as solutions of the lichnerowicz equations,
which are derived by linearizing the equations for ricci-atness of the internal metric,
i.e. r(8)
ab (g + g) = 0. solving these equations shows that the metric deformations can
(to lowest order) be expanded like in (29) and (30) [67]. the expansions are sucient as
we are only interested in the leading terms of the kaluza-klein reduced lagrangian. the
only non-vanishing christoel symbols apart from 
 and the ones with only internal
indices are (in complex coordinates)

the terms in brackets do not contribute to leading order in the expansion of r(11). the

for the reduction of the remaining terms in (22) we have to expand the three-form

in order to nd the kahler potential for the scalars in (c.36) one introduces the coordi-

(c.37)

22strictly speaking one has to replace the calabi-yau metric in these denitions by its background
value. this is related to the fact that we perform the kaluza-klein reduction to rst non-trivial order
around a xed but arbitray point in the moduli space of metrics. this procedure results in couplings
in the eective lagrangian which depend on the arbitrary background values. using eld theoretical
reasoning this can be promoted to full non-linear -model type couplings.
