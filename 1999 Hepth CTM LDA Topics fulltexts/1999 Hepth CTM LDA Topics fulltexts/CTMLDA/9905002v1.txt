abstract

we consider some unitary representations of innite dimensional lie algebras motivated by string
theory on ads3. these include examples of two kinds: the a,d,e type ane lie algebras and the
n = 4 superconformal algebra. the rst presents a new construction for free eld representations
of ane lie algebras. the second is of a particular physical interest because it provides some hints
that a hybrid of the nsr and gs formulations for string theory on ads3 exists.

introduction

this is our second paper in a series of papers in which several physical ideas, (i) the t hooft holo-
graphic principle [1, 2], in particular the ads/cft correspondence [3]; (ii) the greens world-sheets for
worlds-sheets [4]; (iii) topological quantum numbers as central charges of superalgebras [5], are used
as the keystones upon which better understanding of superstring theory on some curved space-times,
specically ads3, should be achieved. the possible relation of string theory on ads3 to two-dimensional
conformal eld theory has been a subject of much interest (see, e.g., [7-18] and references therein) and
has led to a proposal for new representations of generators of some kac-moody and superconformal
(supervirasoro) algebras [7, 8, 14]. thanks to the underlying world-sheet structure such construction
may be called the stringy representation of ane algebras (superalgebras). so far, however, the missing
point of these stringy realizations of the algebras has been their representations. since we are interested
in physics it is natural to restrict ourselves to a particular class of representations, namely the unitary
highest weight representations. according to [19], the hilbert space of any two-dimensional conformal
eld theory decomposes into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors, so it makes sense to start with
considering one of them, say holomorphic. moreover, the holomorphic sector itself is a direct product of
representations. thus our purpose is to build the representations in certain two-dimensional construc-
tions that are of a particular physical interest. however, before we give examples it might be useful to
present some mathematical background.

in general, given a nite-dimensional lie algebra g, the untwisted ane kac-moody algebra g is
simply dened by g = g  c[, 1]  ck  cd, where k is a central element and d is a derivation [6].
there are several candidates for what the parameter  can be. since we are interested in 2d conformal
eld theory, our candidate is a coordinate on a riemann surface. indeed, this is exactly what we need

to build conformal eld theory from representations of the virasoro (kac-moody) algebra, namely to
dene a construction attaching a representation of g to a point on the surface.

this is an old story, however. now, let us assume that there is a new riemann surface whose
coordinate is z such that  is a function of z. such an assumption arises naturally if one thinks of
the second riemann surface as the world-sheet for the rst one, i.e. these are the greens world-sheets
for world-sheets. more rigorously, let p0 be a point on the world-sheet which is a riemann surface
and (u0, z) be a coordinate patch such that p0  u0 and z = 0 for p0. let p be a point on another
two-dimensional manifold (space-time) and (u, ) be a proper coordinate patch. let there be a map
 : u0  u, i.e. a local embedding of the world-sheet into the space-time. it is useful to classify such
maps by their degrees, i.e. integers k given by

k = ic0

dz 1 (z)

,

(1.1)

where the contour c0 surrounds 0. thanks to the local construction c0 is contractible on the world-
dz
z = 1. in the quantum case k

sheet. the normalization is xed by setting k = 1 for (z) = z i.e., hc0
will be interpreted as the central (topological) charge1.

the outline of the paper is as follows. as a warmup, we start in section 2 by describing how a
simple set of free elds on the world-sheet, namely a bosonic rst order system together with a scalar
eld provides the su(2) algebra in the space-time. we show that it is natural to consider two types
of representations of this algebra. the rst type is generated by string vertices i.e., vertex operators
whose conformal dimensions in z are 1, integrated over dz. we call these as the stringy representations.
the second type is similar to the representations known from 2d conformal eld theory. they are
generated by vertex operators whose conformal dimensions in z are arbitrary. so, we call them as the
cft representations. both constructions lead to the unitary representations of su(2).

we then go on in section 3 to generalize the results of section 2 for any ane lie algebra g of a, d,
e type. this is done by simply adding more scalar elds such that their number equals rankg. on the
one hand, this construction is reminiscent of the vertex operator construction due to the same number
of the scalar elds. on the other hand, it is similar to the wakimoto free eld representation due to
the presence of the bosonic rst order system. however, this is, in fact, a new construction for free eld
representations of ane lie algebras. as far as we know, it has not been studied in the mathematical
literature yet.

in section 4, we generalize the construction of section 2 by adding a new scalar eld with a proper
background charge. in this formulation, we show that on the one hand, the space-time theory possesses
the n = 4 superconformal algebra but, on the other hand, the underlying world-sheet theory possesses
the sl(2)  su(2) algebra of level 1. this is an interesting phenomenon that provides evidence for a
hybrid of the nsr and gs formulations for string propagation on ads3. in fact, starting with the nsr
formalism assuming all machinery of 2d cft, we do not need the n = 1 structure, i.e. superconformal
symmetry, on the world-sheet to get the manifest space-time supersymmetry!

finally, section 5 will present our conclusions and directions for future work.

2 the su(2) case

let us consider rst the su(2) algebra in the space-time. for a quantum eld (z) which classically
denes the embedding of the world-sheet into the space-time, we introduce its conjugate eld (z) so
that these dene a rst order (, ) system of weight (1, 0). moreover, let us assume that there is one

1note that in the stringy context k is interpreted as the number of innitely stretched fundamental strings at the

boundary of ads3 while in the framework of the (, ) system k is called the bose-sea level.

more free eld on the world-sheet. for simplicity, let it be a scalar eld (z) without a background
charge, which provides the c = 1 theory. it is well-known that its fock spaces are the representations
of the su(2) ane lie algebra at the level k = 1. to be precise, in the fock spaces the corresponding
holomorphic currents (generation functions of su(2) generators) are represented by

h(z) = i(z)

, e(z) = ei2(z)

.

(2.1)

this is the simplest case of the vertex operator construction, by which a simply-laced ane lie algebra
at the level 1 can be realized in terms of free scalar elds without background charges [20, 21].
a possible way to formulate the space-time su(2) algebra is to dene its generators as [7]2

hn = ic0

dz nh(z)

, en = ic0

dz ne(z)

, n  z .

(2.2)

for (z) = const, this denition reduces to hn = h0n , en = e0 n that agrees, of course, with the
denition of the generators for the centerless su(2) algebra [6].

conformal techniques may be used to calculate the commutation relations. by using the op expan-

sions (z1)(z2) =  ln z12 + o(1) and (z1)(z2) = 1

[hn, hm] = knn+m,0

here the central element k is dened by (1.1), but the eld  is now quantized.

[hn, k] = [en , k] = 0

.

(2.3)

(2.4)

however, this cannot be the whole story, for the reason indicated in the introduction. it is well-
known that the su(2) algebra possesses the unitary highest weight representations that are dened as
follows. let |i be the highest weight vector of su(2) with the weight  namely,

h0|i = |i

(2.5)
the representation v is built as the verma module over su(2) generated by the vector |i. note that
the unitary representations only exist for

0 |i = 0 , hn|i = en |i = 0

, k|i = k|i

for n > 0 .

(2.6)

since we are interested in stringy applications it is natural to look for the unitary representations.
one more reason which forces us to do this is the integer level k. for such values, other degenerate
representations (admissible reps.) do not appear.

for reasons that are standard and will become clear latter, it is convenient to rst bosonize the

(, ) system. the general recipe of [22] tells us to set

(z) = ei1(z)2(z)

,

(z) = i1ei1(z)+2(z)

,

(2.7)

where 1, 2 are the scalar elds with proper background charges and two-point functions normalized
as hi(z1)j(z2)i = ij ln z12.
hn = ic0

in terms of these scalar elds, generators (2.2) take the form

, en = ic0

dz en(i12)e(z)

dz en(i12)h(z)

(2.8)

.

moreover, the formula for the central element k becomes

k = ic0

dz i1  2(z)

.

(2.9)

2we use bold letters for space-time generators here and below.

2.1

stringy representations

in general, the integrands of the string vertex operators corresponding to the physical states are primary
conformal elds. moreover, the reparametrization (conformal) invariance of the theory dictates that such
primaries have dimension one in both z and z so that their integral over dzdz is invariant (see e.g., [22]).
this denition or more exactly its holomorphic version is equivalent to

[ln,o] = 0 ,

where o is a string vertex operator and ln are the virasoro generators on the world-sheet i.e.,

ln = ic0

dz zn+1(cid:0) 

1
2

(cid:1)(z)

.

(2.10)

(2.11)

as a small technical matter, one can check that the generators (2.2) satisfy this requirement. so they
are the string vertex operators.

looking for a highest weight vector of the algebra su(2), we see that there is a natural possibility:

o = ic0

dz eix+1+x2

eix(z)

.

(2.12)

in fact, the action of hn, en , ln on string vertex operators of this type is dened by

t(cid:0)o(cid:1) = ic0

dz2icz2

dz1 j(z1)v (z2) with o = ic0

dz v (z) , t = ic0

dz j(z) , t = hn, en , ln .

(2.13)

the parameters x, x0 are easily determined. according to (2.5), the action of h0 on o is given by
o, so x = . similarly, k acts as ko, which results in x+ + x = k. moreover, we know that the
integrand of the string vertex is the conformal primary of dimension 1 or, equivalently, it must obey
(2.10). this is true for x such that 2 + k(x+  x + 1) = 2. thus the allowed values of x are
2 (k  1

k (2  k  2)), respectively.

the above denition can also be written as

t(cid:0)o(cid:1) = [t,o]

(2.14)

dz 2(z).

dz (z) , 1 = ihc0

dz 1(z) , 2 = hc0

by rescaling o  oc, where c is a proper cocycle factor. it is explicitly given by c = ()p+x+1x2
with p = ihc0
before going on, it is interesting to look at the structure of the integrand for the above vertex
operator. the operator ei(z) turns out to be the highest weight vector for the su(2) multiplet of the
c = 1 theory, while the remaining operator vk(z) = eix+1+x2(z) can be interpreted as an operator
that interpolates between the various bose sea levels of the (, ) system, shifting the level by k 3. on
the other hand, it makes sense to speak of the level 1 su (2) conformal eld theory dressed by the (, )
system due to some analogy with 2d gravity or, equivalently, 1+1 dimensional string theory. eectively,
this su (2) theory has two primary elds corresponding to the highest weight vectors namely, 1 and

ei/2(z) because 2  1. therefore, it is at rst sight natural to expect that the primaries of the
space-time theory are these su (2) elds dressed by proper (, ) elds. we will show a little bit later
that the allowed values of  are 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2. this means that we need elds that are outside
3for x+ 6= 0, actually, this does not create an exact vacuum of the (, ) system with the bose sea-level k from the

vacuum whose bose sea-level is zero. we will return to a discussion of this point in the next subsection.

the basic grid of the level 1 su (2) conformal eld theory. it is well-known that the same phenomenon
happens in 2d gravity coupled to the minimal conformal matter.

now, we come to more a detailed analysis of (2.12) by using (2.13). for hn, we get

hn(cid:0)o(cid:1) = ic0

dz2icz2

dz1 (z12)nk1(cid:16) + o(z12)(cid:17)en(i12)(z1)vkei(z2)

.

(2.15)

from (2.15), we see that k must be integer. otherwise the contour integrals would be ill-dened.
moreover, k must be positive for o to be annihilated by hn with n > 0. in particular, h0 acts as
claimed before.

similarly, en act as

en(cid:0)o(cid:1) = ic0

dz2icz2

dz1 (z12)nk

2ei2en(i12)(z1)vkei(z2)

.

(2.16)

first of all let us note that the contour integrals are well-dened only for 2  z. by considering the
e+
n with n  0, we see that all of the integrands are non-singular for   0. thus these generators
annihilate o. on the other hand, negative powers of z12 may arise for en with n > 0 unless 2  k.
therefore, the highest weight vectors exist only for  = 0, 1/2, . . . , k/2, which is of course the desired
result because exactly such values of  and k dene the unitary representations (see (2.6)).

thus we have built the highest weight vectors for the su(2) algebra dened by (2.2). it remains
to show that the verma modules generated by such vectors contain only the string vertex operators.
this can be done inductively, using the fact that hn, en and o are stringy. if we take, for example,
hn(cid:0)o(cid:1) then

lmhn(cid:0)o(cid:1) = hnlm(cid:0)o(cid:1) = 0

or taking the cocycle factor into account,

[lm, hn(cid:0)o(cid:1)] = [lm, [hn,o]] = [hn, [lm,o]]  [o, [lm, hn]] = 0

.

the same can be easily repeated for a general state from the verma module. so we have built the
unitary highest weight representations of su(2). at this point, a couple of comments are in order.

(i) in addition to the highest weight vectors built above, there are other vectors that may be im-
portant in the future. first let us determine the string vertices corresponding to the lowest weight
vectors for the su(2) multiplets of the c = 1 theory. they are related to the highest weight vectors as

o = (cid:0)e0 (cid:1)

2(cid:0)o(cid:1). after a simple calculation, we nd

(2.17)

(2.18)

o  ic0

dz vkei(z)

.

(2.19)

now we want to continue calculations to determine the stringy vertices corresponding to some of the

see from (2.16) and (2.19) that there is no short distance singularity in the integrand corresponding

2+1|i. we
2+1(cid:0)o(cid:1). thus, it must vanish for   0. similarly, a relatively long but straightforward

singular vectors of v. the singular vectors of interest are (cid:0)e0 (cid:1)
to (cid:0)e0 (cid:1)
calculation shows that (cid:0)e+

(ii) having the representation v of the space-time su(2) algebra, it is worth saying about the space-
time meaning of such states. in fact, the dictionary for comparing the conformal family (elds) to the
space of states (representation) is known [19]. let us give an example of the use of this dictionary. for

1(cid:1)k

2+1(cid:0)o(cid:1) = 0 for 2  k.

2+1|i and (cid:0)e+

the highest weight vector o, we have o = lim0 ()|0i, where () is the primary eld. it is clear
that it is nothing but the zero mode of  in our cylindrical coordinates (1, 2). on general grounds, it
immediately comes to mind to introduce a new string vertex operator o
k ei(z)
that corresponds to the nth mode of .

dz en(i12)v (n)

n = hc0

2.2 cft representations

what we have done so far was just to learn how to build the stringy representations for su(2) given by
(2.2). now we go over to conformal eld theory. in doing so, we must bear in mind that the primary
conformal elds may generally have dimensions that are dierent from one, and then their integrals over
dz are not invariant4. let (0) be the primary eld setting at z = 0. in the framework of cft (see
[19]), the action of the virasoro (kac-moody) generators on (0) is dened by

ln(cid:0)(0)(cid:1) = ic0

dz zn+1t (z)(0)

.

here t (z) means the stress tensor of a world-sheet theory.

likewise, we dene the action for the stringy generators

t(cid:0)(0)(cid:1) = ic0

dz j(z)(0)

, t = ic0

dz j(z)

.

looking for highest weight vectors of su(2), we see again that there is a natural possibility:

(0) = vqeix(0)

,

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

where vq(0) should be interpreted as the exact vacuum operator of the (, ) system whose bose sea
level is q. its opes with  and 

(z)vq(0)  zq

,

(z)vq(0)  zq

,

z  0

result in vq(0) = eq2(0) [22].

now we will briey discuss the application of these ideas to the construction of the unitary repre-

sentations. the parameters q and x are found by evaluating h0(cid:0)(0)(cid:1) and k(cid:0)(0)(cid:1). eq. (2.22) thus

takes the form

(0) = ek2+i(0)

.

(2.23)

moreover, it can be shown that  turns out to be the highest weight vector only if k and  obey (2.6).
in addition to the highest weight vector, there are other states that may be easily determined.

one state is (cid:0)e0 (cid:1)
multiplet. the second is (cid:0)e0 (cid:1)
module v generated by the highest weight vector (0). finally, we have (cid:0)e+

2(0)  ek2i(0), which corresponds to the lowest weight vector of the su(2)
2+1(0) = 0, which corresponds to the singular vector of the verma
2+1(0) = 0,

which corresponds to the second singular vector of v. at this point a remark is in order.

it is well-known that the fock space of (1, 2) (large space) is twice as large as the fock space
of (, ) (small space) [22]. to be more precise, it is dened as f(, ) = {v  f(1, 2), 0v = 0},
dz ei1(z). our denition of the space-time generators includes negative powers of  that
where 0 = hc0

4recall that we consider only the holomorphic sector.

1(cid:1)k

6

automatically leads to 0v 6= 0. indeed, 0(cid:0)n(0)(cid:1) = hc0
for n < 0. thus we have the large space5.

dz znei1(z)+n(i12)(0) that does not vanish

now, what is special about the examples we have given in this section? to understand that, note
that the same arguments that show that (0) given by eq. (2.23) is the highest weight vector show that
it is invariant under (0)  e(i12)(0) with an arbitrary parameter . so, the highest weight
vector takes the following form

(0) = ei1+(k)2+i(0)

.

(2.24)

we considered two special cases:  = 1

2 (k + 1

k (2  k  2)) and  = 0.

simply-laced algebras

an obvious generalization of what we have just done is the following. consider a set of scalar elds {i}
without background charges. this ensures that it is possible to construct the level 1 representation of g
whenever g is a simply-laced algebra i.e., it has equal length roots and hence is of the a, d, e type. this
is the so-called vertex operator construction [20, 21]. in the cartan-weyl basis of g, the corresponding
holomorphic currents (generation functions) are represented by

h i(z) = ii(z)

, e(z) = ei(z)c

,

(3.1)

where i = 1, . . . , rank g,  is a root of g, c is a cocycle factor (see e.g., [24] for a review). all roots have

length 2. the two-point functions of the free elds are normalized as hi(z1)j(z2)i = ij ln z12.

we take the space-time generators to be

hi

n = ic0

dz nh i(z)

, e

n = ic0

dz ne(z)

, n  z ,

(3.2)

which is a natural generalization to arbitrary g of what we had for su(2). it is clear that for  = const,
the denition agrees with the denition of the generators for a centerless ane algebra [6].

now, let us calculate the commutation relations of the space-time generators. using conformal

techniques, we obtain

[hi

n, hj

m] = knijn+m,0

before continuing our discussion, we will make a detour and recall some basics facts on the uni-

the representation v is built as the verma module over g generated by the vector |i. there is a
simple set of necessary and sucient conditions for there to be a unitary highest weight representation
of g in which k and  take special values; it is

k  n ,

0      k with     n .

(3.6)

it is straightforward to rewrite the space-time generators of g in terms of the scalar elds. using

(2.7), we nd

hi

n = ic0

dz en(i12)h i(z)

, e

n = ic0

dz en(i12)e(z)

.

(3.7)

3.1 stringy representations

first, to complete our discussion of the space-time generators (3.2), we should perhaps point out that
in the problem at hand, they obey

[ln, hi

m] = [ln, e

m] = 0 ,

where ln are the virasoro generators on the world-sheet i.e.,

ln = ic0

dz zn+1(cid:0) 

1
2

  (cid:1)(z)

.

(3.8)

(3.9)

thus, they are the string vertex operators.

now, our task is to build the unitary highest weight representations for g given by (3.7). in the
su (2) case that we have considered, it is not hard to guess how to do this. in a similar way we can try
to dene o as

o = ic0

dz eix+1+x2

eix(z)

.

(3.10)

the only dierence is therefore that x has become a rank g-dimensional vector.

the next step in nding the highest weight vector is to adopt the prescription (2.13) in the present
situation. by using this denition, the parameters x, xi may be explicitly determined as follows.
0 on o is given by io, hence xi = i. similarly, k acts as ko
according to (3.5), the action hi
that results in x+ + x = k. moreover, we know that o must commute with ln given by (3.9). the
last is true only for x such that    + k(x+  x + 1) = 2. thus, the allowed values of x are
2 (k  1
k (2  k    )). before going on, let us note that it is also straightforward to write the action
in the form of (2.14) by rescaling o  oc, where c is a cocycle factor. in this case, it is given
by c = ()p+x+1x22
dz 2(z).

let us now examine the operators o more closely. the basic tool is conformal eld technique. the

evaluation of the actions for hi

n gives

hi

n(cid:0)o(cid:1) = ic0

dz2 icz2

dz1 (z12)nk1(cid:16)i + o(z12)(cid:17)en(i12)(z1)vkei(z2)

.

(3.11)

it immediately follows that the contour integrals are well-dened only for k  z. this is in harmony
with what we have, since our topological construction of k allows only integer values. moreover, we see

8

that hi
would not vanish. in particular, hi

n with n > 0 annihilate o because the integrand is non-singular for k > 0. otherwise, hi

0 act as claimed before.

n(cid:0)o(cid:1)

in a similar way one can also nd the actions for e

n. these are given by

e

n(cid:0)o(cid:1) = ic0

dz2 icz2

dz1 (z12)nk+eien(i12)(z1)vkei(z2)

.

(3.12)

this time the contour integrals are well-dened if     z. by considering  > 0 and n > 0, we
see that the corresponding e
n annihilate o for     0. on the other hand, we see that there is a
restriction k     that guarantees the vanishing of all e
n(cid:0)o(cid:1) for n > 0 and negative roots. thus we
have recovered the standard conditions (3.6) and have succeeded in nding the highest weight vectors
for the unitary representations of g.

n, e

it remains to show that the verma modules generated by such vectors contain only the string vertex
operators. the analysis proceeds exactly as in the previous section. the basis point is that all operators
n and o are stringy. as a consequence, any state from the verma module turns out to be stringy
hi
too. this completes our construction of the unitary representations for g.
in addition to the highest weight vectors built above, there are other important vectors that may
be easily determined. let us give a couple of examples. for instance, we can nd the lowest weight
dz vkei(z). moreover,
vectors for the g multiplet. a short computation shows that these are hc0
having the set of roots {}, we can choose a simple root  among them. it is well-known that the
0 (cid:1)+1|i. a simple dimensional analysis shows
singular vector associated with this simple root is (cid:0)e
that (cid:0)e

0 (cid:1)+1(cid:0)o(cid:1) = 0 within our construction.

3.2 cft representations

we will briey summarize the generalization for an arbitrary simply-laced algebra g.

first of all, the highest weight vector is given by

(0) = vqeix(0)

,

(3.13)

where vq(0) is again the q-vacuum operator of the (, ) system. the primary eld is setting at z = 0.
the parameters q and x are found by evaluating the hi
0 and k on (3.13). thus, the hight weight vector
becomes

(0) = ek2+i(0)

.

(3.14)

moreover, a simple analysis again shows that i and k must obey (3.6), i.e. the representation we

built is unitary.

in addition to the highest weight vector, the lowest weight vector of the g multiplet may be easily

it is given by (0)  ek2i(0). moreover, the singular vectors (cid:0)e

vanish.

4 the n=4 case

we now want to reconsider the above discussion in the context of supersymmetry. one of the most
interesting problems of this kind concerns the n = 4 superconformal algebra. there are at least two
reasons to say so. the rst is its appearance in a description of superstring propagation on ads3 [3].
the second is that the algebra includes su(2) as a subalgebra, so we need a slight generalization of what

9

we have done in section 2. first let us make a short detour to summarize several results obtained in
[14].

according to the arguments by ito and further elucidated by ourselves, adding fermionic coordinates
geometrically turns space-time into a superspace. more precisely, this means that we add to the (, )
system a set of rst order fermionic systems of weights (1, 0). to get the space-time n = 4 supercon-
formal algebra, it is enough to add two systems, say (, ) and (, ). according to [22], any rst order
fermionic system can be bosonized by a scalar eld with a proper background charge. in particular, the
fermionic elds in the problem at hand are given by

(z) = ei(z)

,

(z) = ei(z)

,

(z) = ei (z)

,

(z) = ei (z)

.

it is advantageous to introduce new elds as

1(z) =

1
2

( + )(z)

( + )(z)

,

, 2(z) =

1
2
2 11  1

which leads to the world-sheet stress-tensor t (z) =  1
22(z). thus we have
the c = 1 theory and an additional theory with c = 5. to generalization our treatment in section
2, we therefore need to add the scalar eld 2 with the background charge. now it is obvious how to
build the su(2) subalgebra of the space-time n = 4 algebra. it is simply given by (2.2). as to the other
generators, they can be found in [14]. in terms of the scalar elds, these are6

at this point, it is necessary to make a remark. one of the important statements about the n =
4 superconformal algebra was the following observation by schwimmer and seiberg [25]. there is
an innite set of independent sectors (algebras) of n = 4 labeled by an angular valued parameter
corresponding to the conjugate classes of su (2). thus representations for a given value of the central
charge c are not equivalent for dierent values of the parameter. in our discussion, we restrict ourselves
to the neveu-schwarz sector, so n, m  z; r, s  z+ 1
2 in (4.2) and below. of course, it seems interesting
to develop our approach for a general case elsewhere.

it is well-known (see [26]) that the n = 4 superconformal algebra possesses the unitary highest

weight representations that are dened as follows. let |h, ji be the highest weight vector, namely

, t0

l0|h, ji = h|h, ji
ln|h, ji = ta

n|h, ji = 0 ,

0|h, ji = j|h, ji

the representation vh,j is built as the verma module over n = 4 generated by the vector |h, ji. it turns
out that there exist two classes of the unitary representations:

(4.5)

we pause here to point out a subtlety that we have not revealed so far. the preceding analysis of
the commutation relations and the representations is valid only for well-dened integrands. in other
words, the integrands of (2.21) for the cft representations (or (2.13) for the stringy representations)
are single-valued as z (z1) goes around the origin (z2) so that the integration contour closes (see fig.1).

z

figure 1: the integration contour in eq. (2.21).

this is compatible with the claim that the level k and the weights take special discrete values. it is
amusing that these values correspond to unitary representations (see (3.6)). in other words, the local
objects of the world-sheet theory result in the unitary space-time theory.

on the other hand, suppose that we replace the discrete values of the weights by generic ones. the
main point is that the integration contour no longer closes. a possible way to bring the situation under
control is to dene a new integration contour as shown in fig.2
the object just dened is similar to the screened vertex operator of cft, but one detail is dierent,
namely we have a representation of g rather than uq(g), as is usual in cft. note that such construction

is nonlocal since it denes the bilocal objects that depend on two points 0 and , where the cut ends.
the last does not sound reasonable within string theory. for the unitary representations of simply-
laced algebras, this is not so because they have the discrete values of the weights. however, the massive
representations of n = 4 exhibit a continuum in the spectrum of conformal dimensions that can aect
the locality of a theory on the world-sheet7. at the present time it is not known whether the situation
may be taken under control. so we are bound to learn something if we succeed.

4.1 cft representations

now we want to build the highest weight representations on the n = 4 algebra within cft. in this
setting, it is natural to start by writing down the highest weight vector in the following form:

h.j(0) = vqeix(0)

.

(4.6)

note that the approach we use is similar to that of subsection 3.2, but the problem is dierent.
particular, we have the scalar eld 2 with the background charge.

in

the generators k, l0 and t0

0 must act on h.j according to (4.3). for this to be so, the bose sea level
q must have the value k. also, the allowed values of x1, x2 must be 2j and 2(h  k), respectively.

thus, the highest weight vector is

h.j(0) = ek2+i2j1+i2(hk)2(0)

.

(4.7)

to be more precise about this, to convince the reader that this is indeed the case, we have to prove
the statement. this is proved by explicitly evaluating actions of the n = 4 generators on the highest
weight vector.

for ln, we get

ln(cid:0)h.j(0)(cid:1) = ic0

dz znk1(cid:16)h + (h  k)n + o(z)(cid:17)ein1+(kn)2+i2j1+i2(hk)2(0)

.

(4.8)

it immediately follows that the contour integral is well-dened only for k  z. moreover, the ln with
n > 0 annihilate h.j only if k > 0. that is in harmony with what we had before.
n act on the highest weight vector. for tn , the actions are

now, let us see what happens when ta

given by

tn(cid:0)h.j(0)(cid:1) = ic0

dz znk2j(cid:16)1 + o(z)(cid:17)ein1+(kn)2+i2(j1)1+i2(hk)2(0)

.

(4.9)

this means that the contour integral is well-dened only for 2j  z. moreover, one can specify n
to determine the allowed values of j. for t+
0 (cid:0)h.j(0)(cid:1) = 0, which implies 2j  n. for t1 ,

particular, strings on ads3), see [18].

12

t1 (cid:0)h.j(0)(cid:1) must also vanish, which leads to j  k

representations (4.5). for t0

n, we have

2 . the latter is exactly the property of the massless

dz znk1(cid:16)j + o(z)(cid:17)ein1+(kn)2+i2j1+i2(hk)2(0)

.

(4.10)

we see that all of the integrands are non-singular for n > 0, so such the t0

0, it acts as claimed before.

n annihilate h.j(0). as to

now, let us turn to the fermionic generators. in this discussion, we neglect the cocycle factors as

they result in irrelevant numerical factors. for the fermionic generators gr , we have

gr (cid:0)h.j(0)(cid:1) = ic0

dz zk(r 1

2 )+hj(cid:16)1 + o(z)(cid:17)ei(r+ 1

2 )1+(kr 1

2 )2+i2(j 1

2 )1+i2(hk+ 1

2 )2(0)

.

(4.11)

we see that the integrand is single-valued i.e., the integration contour closes, if h  j  z. this
requirement and the requirement j  k
2 found in above imply, together, that we only get the massless
representations within our construction. in a similar way, for the gr , we have

gr (cid:0)h.j(0)(cid:1) = ic0
 ei(r 1

)(h  k) + o(z)(cid:17)

(4.12)

that gives rise to h  j  z. as the result, we are again restricted to the massless representations.
thus, as promised in the introduction to this section, the local objects of the world-sheet theory
result in the unitary space-time theory; in contrast to the ane lie algebras (at least a,d,e type),
however, we have not found the all unitary representations. the problem occurs with the massive
representations when there exists a continuum in the spectrum of conformal dimensions.

to understand what is special about these massless representations, it helps to consider their singular
vectors. first, we consider the bosonic singular vectors i.e., the ones obtained by applying bosonic

generators to the highest weight vector. these are simply (cid:0)t0 (cid:1)2j+1(cid:0)j.j(0)(cid:1) and (cid:0)t+

the analysis proceeds exactly as in subsection 2.1 and shows that the vectors vanish. moreover, being
the massless representation, the verma module generated by j.j(0) possesses the fermionic singular
vectors [27]. the vectors of interest are g+
2(cid:0)j.j(0)(cid:1) and g+
2(cid:0)j.j(0)(cid:1). setting r =  1
2 as well as
 1
 1
h = j in (4.12), we see that the integrand is regular. as a result, we get g+
2(cid:0)j.j(0)(cid:1) = 0. on the
 1
other hand, equation (4.11) gives g+
2(cid:0)j.j(0)(cid:1) 6= 0. thus, the representation we built is reducible.
 1

of course, one can try to perform the same analysis for the stringy representations. however, we
do not see much sense in this because the construction does not catch the massive representations. so,
something is missing in our understanding.

0 (cid:1)k2j+1(cid:0)j.j(0)(cid:1).

4.2 more comments on the underlying world-sheet algebra

finally, we will present a description of the underlying world-sheet algebra that is more precise than
we gave in [14]. to begin with, we review the original analysis.
in the framework of the free elds
(, ), (, ), (, ), there exists the following representation of the ane superalgebra sl(2|1) at the

of course, the space-time n = 4 generators can be rewritten in terms of the world-sheet sl(2|1)
generators, which provides a new relation between these algebras [14]. although such construction
looks in many ways attractive, we have to stress a subtle point here. the central charge of sl(2|1)
identically equals zero while the free elds have a total central charge ct = 2. so, some world-sheet
degrees of freedom are missing. to understand what happened, it helps to bosonize the fermionic elds
as we have done in subsection 4.1. then the bosonic generators are rewritten as

j 0(z) =

i
2

1(z)

,

j(z) = ei21(z)

,

j 3(z) =  

i
2

2(z)

.

(4.15)

due to the above formula, we can think of 1 as the scalar eld that provides the world-sheet su(2)
algebra at the level 1 (see (2.1)). as for j 3, it corresponds to the u (1) current in the wakimoto free eld
representation of sl(2) [28]. however, the metric signature is now (, +, +). the rest of the currents is
given by

j (z) = (z)

, j +(z) = 2  i22 + (z)

.

(4.16)

it is not dicult to nd the level of sl(2) which turns out to be 1. thus, we have the world-sheet
sl(2)  su(2) algebra at the levels 1. the central charge of this model exactly equals 2. moreover,
the sugawara construction results in the stress-tensors of the free elds. this allows us to say that

8our conventions will be those of [14] (see eq.(3.28)).

14

all degrees of freedom are taken into account. furthermore, the fermionic generators (4.13) are simply
given in terms of sl(2)  su(2) primaries by

before going on, it would be interesting to interpret the n = 4 highest weight vectors (4.7) as
representations of the underlying world-sheet sl(2)  su(2) algebra. in thinking about this question, a
natural analogy arises with 2d gravity. this may be seen explicitly as follows. in the su (2) conformal
eld theory (wzw model at a xed point) of level 1, there are only two primary elds which belong to
the basic grid of the model, i.e. j  1
2 . therefore, it is at rst sight natural to expect that the n = 4
primary elds are these su (2) elds dressed by proper sl(2) elds. from our discussion of this issue,
we have seen that there are, however, extra states for k > 1 appearing as dressed type states outside
the basic grid, i.e. j > 1
9. it is well-known that the same happened within 2d gravity coupled to the
2
minimal conformal matter.

we will here conclude this section with brief observations about string theory on ads3  s3.

it
has been much studied recently in both the nsr and gs formulations (see, e.g., [7-18, 29-31] and refs.
therein). here we will note interesting facts relevant to this problem.

the starting point within the nsr approach to string theory on ads3  s3 is rst to consider the
corresponding bosonic theory. this usually involves the sl(2)  su (2) wzw model as a keystone. to
extend the analysis to superstrings, the virasoro (conformal) algebra on the world-sheet is replaced by
the n = 1 superconformal algebra. technically, this is achieved by introducing free fermions taking
their values in the lie algebra sl(2)  su(2). the nsr framework makes it possible to discuss a lot
but it is not very convenient for discussing the space-time supersymmetry because it requires working
in all pictures simultaneously. in other words, the algebra does not close on a nite number of bose
sea-levels for the superconformal ghosts. what we have done so far is just recall how to get the space-
time supersymmetry in the nsr description of ads3  s3. now we wish to show that there exists
in doing so, we must bear in
a simpler formulation that results in the space-time supersymmetry.
mind that the bosonic sl(2)  su (2) wzw model is bosonized by the wakimoto and vertex operator
constructions as given by (4.15) and (4.16). then the n = 4 superconformal generators are simply
given by (4.1)! thus, we do not need the n = 1 superconformal algebra anymore. moreover, we get a
manifest supersymmetry which is due to the fermions ,  hidden by such bosonization. both of these
features are typical for the gs formulation. can we interpret this construction as a hybrid of the nsr
and gs formulations? we cannot rule out this hypothesis because it is well-known that d = 2 is a
delicate case from the conformal eld theory point of view. so, something special may happen.

5 conclusions and remarks

first let us say a few words about the results.

in this work we have built the unitary representations of the ane lie algebras a, d, e type as well
as the massless representations of the n = 4 superconformal algebra that is a natural continuation of

9strictly speaking, the ei2j are not primary for the su (2) wzw model of level 1.

15

what we did in our previous work. it is found that the postulates (i)-(iii), as these are formulated in
the introduction, are not only useful for string propagation on ads3, but are in fact crucial to get new
constructions. indeed, using the greens idea world-sheets for world-sheets results in new free eld
representations of ane lie algebras that contain fewer free elds than the corresponding wakimoto
representations have. the same is also true for the n = 4 superconformal algebra.
it opens new
possibilities in studying innite dimensional lie algebras. moreover, we have presented the hints in
favor of the existence of a new construction (hybrid) for string propagation on ads3. it is clear that
further work is needed to make this more rigorous. so, let us conclude by mentioning a few problems
that are seemed the most important to us.

(i) of course, the most important open problem is to understand how to incorporate the massive
representations of the n = 4 superconformal algebra into our construction. as we noted in subsection
4.1, these representations exhibit a continuum in the spectrum of the conformal dimensions. this is
exactly the reason why our construction fails. however, there exists a deeper problem. up to now it is
not known what the op algebra and correlation functions of the n = 4 cft are.

(ii) the new construction proposed in section 3 to get the free eld representations of ane lie
algebras of the a, d, e, type requires much work in the future to reach such mathematical understanding
as we have for the vertex operator construction and the wakimoto free eld representation. our analysis
of section 3 is essentially a physical one.

(iii) finally, the problem that obviously deserves more attention is the hypothesis about a hybrid of
the nsr and gs formulations for string theory on ads3. here we need a fuller understanding of the
problem on the level of a proper polyakov path integral.
