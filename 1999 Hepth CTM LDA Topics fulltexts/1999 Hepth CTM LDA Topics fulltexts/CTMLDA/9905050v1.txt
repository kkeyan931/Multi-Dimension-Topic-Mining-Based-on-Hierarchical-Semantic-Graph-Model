abstract

in this note we derive an explicit modular invariant formula for the
two loop 4-point amplitude in superstring theory in terms of a multi-
ple integral (7 complex integration variables) over the complex plane
which is shown to be convergent. we consider in particular the case
of the leading term for vanishing momenta of the four graviton am-
plitude, which would correspond to the two-loop correction of the r4
term in the eective action. the resulting expression is not positive
denite and could be zero, although we cannot see that it vanishes.

1 introduction and summary

inspired by a recent argument [1, 2] about the r4 term in superstring theory,
it is necessary to reconsider the niteness of the superstring two-loop 4-
graviton amplitude [3], especially for the case of vanishing momenta which
was not discussed in detail previously in [3]. the arguments given in [3] were
not complete. we can extend these arguments and make them precise [4].
however we will take a dierent route here.

first we derive an explicit modular invariant formula for the two-loop
4-point amplitude. we remind that the genus-2 riemann surface, which is
the appropriate world sheet for two loops, can be described in full generality
by means of the hyperelliptic formalism. this is based on a representation
of the surface as two sheet covering of the complex plane described by the
equation:

y2(z) =

6

(z  ai),

yi=1

(1)

the complex numbers ai, (i = 1,    , 6) are the six branch points, by going
around them one passes from one sheet to the other. three of them represent
the moduli of the genus 2 riemann surface over which the integration is
performed, while the other three can be arbitrarily xed. in fact, the two-loop
formula, which we obtained by implementing in the hyperelliptic formalism
the general algorithm [5] for a multi-genus worldsheet, is expressed as an
integral over the riemann surface moduli, i.e. three branch points, and over
the four (complex) position of the vertex operators. the whole integrand,
including the measure, is sl(2, c) invariant and thus three points (i.e. the
remaining branch points) are arbitrarily xed. modular invariance in this
language amounts to invariance under permutations of ai, (i = 1,    , 6), and
it is not explicitely apparent in the expression for the amplitude given in [3].
one of the main goal of this paper is to get it manifest.

our strategy is the following.

in our previous calculation we xed 3
branch points by using the sl(2, c) invariance of the hyperelliptic represen-
tation of genus 2 riemann surface. here instead (see sect. 2) we choose to
x 3 out of the 4 vertex operator points and integrate all the 6 branch points.
we do it by making a suitable sl(2, c) change of variables on our previous
formula. amazingly an explicit modular invariant formula is obtained for
the 4-point amplitude. this formula is like the koba-nielsen formula for the

2

tree amplitude in string theory, in that it is in fact represented as an integral
over the whole complex plane of one of the four vertex positions (the other
three being xed). furthermore there is also the integration over the whole
complex plane of the six branch points which appear symmetrically in the
integrand.

with this new formula in hand we study its niteness property by mak-
ing a convenient choice of the two arbitrary parameters from supercurrent
insertion points (some basic facts about this ingredient of the construction of
the amplitude are recalled in sect. 2.1). we get thus the following formula
for the zero momentum limit of the four graviton amplitude in type ii (a
or b) superstring theory (z1,2,3 = z0

1,2,3 arbitrarily xed):

where t (the determinant of the period matrix of the surface) is a function
of ai, ai given in eq. (5) below, k is the standard 4-graviton kinematical
factor [6, 3] (see appendix b for details and its relation with the r4 term)
and v is a constant factor:

(3)

the constant cii in front of the amplitude in eq. (2) can be determined
by the unitarity relations which for generic momenta relate the two-loop
expression with the one-loop and the tree level amplitudes, and thus it is
nonzero.

one can check that the integrand of the above formula is sl(2, c) in-
variant (including the measure), i.e.
invariant under a simultaneous trans-
formation of all the ais and zls of the kind w  (aw + b)/(cw + d) with
ad  bc = 1. every factor transforms nontrivially and it is rather amazing to
see how the whole formula is calibrated. it is also manifestly invariant under
permutations of the six branch points a1,,6, i.e. it is manifestly modular in-
variant. in sect. 3 we make a thorough study of all the possible boundaries
of the moduli space and prove that the amplitude is nite, i.e. it is expressed
as a convergent 7-(complex)-dimensional integral.

3

it is not clear whether the result of the integration is zero as it should be
for in agreement with the arguments given in refs. [1, 2] about the absence
of n-loop (with n larger than 1) contributions to the r4 term. the above
expression for the integrand is certainly not positive denite (we will see in
sect. 2.2 that attemping to get a positive denite integrand by adding some
total derivative, as it was uncorrectly argued in [3], is not possible due to
boundary terms). still it does not appear to be zero in an obvious way.
this can be contrasted with the fact that using the same formalism we have
veried other nonrenormalization theorems [7], namely the vanishing of the
amplitude with less than 4 vertices. in those cases the integrand itself was
found to be zero.

2.1 heterotic string amplitude

to simplify the presentation we will rst discuss the amplitude for heterotic
string. the two loop 4-point amplitude in heterotic string theory obtained
in [3, 8] is

y(zl)

yl=1

i(r) f (a, z),

(4)

ah0 = ch kh z d2a1d2a2d2a3 |a45 a46 a56|2

i<j |aij|2

where kh is a kinematic factor depending on the left sector particle con-
tents and f (a, z) is a function denoting the contribution from left sector of
the heterotic string theory. the complex numbers ai, (i = 1,    , 6) and the
function y(z) which describe the riemann surface have been introduced in
the rst section, see eq. (1). three of the six branch points, say a1,2,3, rep-
resent the moduli of the genus 2 riemann surface over which the integration
is performed, while a4,5,6 are arbitrarily xed. modular invariance in this
language amounts to invariance under permutations of ai, (i = 1,    , 6), and
it is not explicitely apparent in eq. (4). one of the main goal of this paper
is to get it manifest. let us remind that eq. (4) is obtained after summing
over the even spin structures with signs uniquely xed by the requirement of
modular invariance [9]. there is no contribution from the odd spin structure.

4

in fact, the four vertices and the two supercurrent insertion (which we recall
below) could just provide the required ten fermionic zero modes, resulting in
a contribution proportional to the completely antisymmetric ten dimensional
tensor. since it will be contracted with the four momenta, which are linearly
dependent, the result will be identically zero.

we also recall that f (a, z) is symmetric under permutations of ai, (i =

1,    , 6). the other functions appearing in (4) are

t (ai, ai) = z d2z1d2z2|z1  z2|2

which is proportional to the determinant of the period matrix (see ref. [8]),

as we proved in [3, 8] the amplitude ah0 is independent of the param-
eter r. this parameter r represents the arbitrary point of insertion of the
two supercurrents (also called picture-changing operators) as appropriate for
genus 2 where there are two zero modes of the  superghost. we have chosen
to insert those two supercurrents at the same point r in the upper and lower
sheet of the double covering of the complex plane described by eq. (1). the
independence of the result from r is in agreement with a general derivation
in ref. [5] where it is shown in general that a displacement of r amounts to
an irrelevant total derivative in the moduli space.

in fact, we note that i(r) is a rational function of r. by a standard

argument from complex analysis or by explicit computation we have

4

i(r)

(r  zl) =

ii(r)

xi=1

4

(ai  zl) + i,

yl=1

(7)

where i is independent of r (see eq. (34) in appendix a) and ii(r) contains
the pole singularities for r  ai.

5

as we proved in [3], all these singular terms give total derivatives when
we insert eq. (7) into the 4-point amplitude (4). for instance the formula
relevant for ii(r), (i = 1, 2, 3) is (see the appendix a for further details):

ii(r)

t 5q6

similar formulas hold also for ii(r), (i = 4, 5, 6) (eq. (39) in appendix
a). these total derivative terms give zero contribution when integrated over
the moduli as in eq. (4), since we proved in [3, 8] that there are no possible
boundary contributions. therefore ah0 is independent from r.

next, we note that the amplitude (4) is sl(2, c) invariant, i.e. a simul-
taneous sl(2, c) transformation on all the integration variables a1,2,3, z1,2,3,4
and the xed point a4,5,6 and r leaves ah0 invariant, i.e.

ah0 = ch kh z d2s(a1)d2s(a2)d2s(a3) q6

(9)

where s denotes an sl(2, c) transformation. here the functions t , y(s(z))
and i(s(r)) have in their denitions with ai changed to s(ai). s(x) depends
on three parameters q1,2,3 and thus we set

s(x)  sq(x) =

(q1  q2)(x  q3)
(q1  q3)(x  q2)

.

now we insert the following identity

where we have renamed sq(ai) to be ai, sq(zl) to be zl and y 2(z) = q6

i=1(z
ai). also we changed the name of sl(2, c) transformation of sq to be sa,
since q1,2,3 are xed in terms of a4,5,6. explicitly we have

sq(r) = sa(r) =

a6(a4  a5)r  a4(a6  a5)

(a4  a5)r  (a6  a5)

.

(15)

from eq. (14) we see that because of the 3  functions the integration
variables z1,2,3 are xed and all the a1,,6 are integrated. nevertheless this
formula is not explicitly modular invariant, i.e. its not invariant under any
interchange of ai and aj.
in what follows we will put it into a modular
invariant form.

notice that im (x) is a modular invariant function, i.e. invariant under any
permutation of the branch points ai, (i = 1,    , 6). so we obtain a modular
invariant formula for the two loop 4-particle amplitude in heterotic string
theory.
it is also independent of the parameter x as one can easily check
that changing x amounts to irrelevant total derivatives, as we have done in
appendix a.

2.2 type ii superstring amplitude

for type ii superstring theory, we can use the same method to get a modular
invariant formula. let us start with the two loop 4-point amplitude (with
vanishing momenta) in type ii superstring theory [3, 8]:

aii0 = cii kz d2a1d2a2d2a3 |a45 a46 a56|2

where k is the standard 4-graviton kinematical factor [6, 3]. the complete
amplitude and k factor is given in appendix b. now there are two arbitrary
parameters from supercurrent-insertion points, r from the right sector and s
from the left sector. again, the resulting amplitude aii0 is independent of
them.

now we perform the same trick of performing a sl(2, c) transformation

on (19) as in the heterotic string case and obtain the following:

aii0 = cii k z q6
t 5q6

. (20)

to proceed further we need some formulas reported in the appendix b.
by using eq. (51) of the appendix b in (20), it is now easy to derive
an explicit modular invariant formula for type ii superstring by dropping all
total derivative terms. we get

d2zl(x  zl)( w  zl)

.(21)

where im (x) is the same as in eq. (16). again, x and w are arbitrary and
the result does not depend on them.

we note that we cant set x = w in eq. (21) because with x = w in eq.
(21) aii0 is divergent. the important point to note here is the following:
the total derivative terms (see eq. (51)) which would be dropped are actually
in this case non-vanishing and divergent. this can be clearly demonstrated
by the following computation (ai  x = r ei):



1

 he2i f (a, a) im ( w)i! . (22)

in the above equation the last term is a total derivative in  and can be
dropped. on the other hand the rst term is a total derivative in r and its
integration over r gives two terms evaluated at the points r =  and r = :

z 2

0

d(cid:16)e2i f (a, a) im ( w)|r=  e2i f (a, a) im ( w)|r=(cid:17) .

(23)

9

here we only need to consider the second term because the rst term is just
an artifact of cuto. when w 6= x, the second term is regular for r =   0
( ai w)2 from im ( w)
and so there is no boundary term. when w = x, the term 1
gives a contribution which is 2
2 after integration over  which is divergent
for   0 while the other terms give non-vanishing but nite contributions.

3 the niteness of the amplitude

now we study the niteness property of the amplitude aii0 in (21). first we
make the following choice of the two arbitrary parameters x and w (which
have their origin as the insertion point of the supercurrents): x = z 0
1 and
w = z 0

2 . with this choice the amplitude aii0 simplies greatly:

aii0 = cii k v z q6

(25)

to prepare the discussion of niteness of the above amplitude we rst
2  z4) times
note that due to the angular integration, the factor (z 0
the second line of eq. (24) can be omitted. although this factor may be
singular for ai  z 0
1,2), the singular terms
only appear either in the holomorphic part or the anti-holomorphic part.
the integration over the angular variable then gives a contribution which is
always not more singular than the contribution without this factor. so for
the purpose of discussing niteness we can just consider the niteness of the
truncated expression:

1,2 (it is not singular for z4  z 0

|y (z 0

(26)

to discuss the niteness property of the amplitude aiit in (26) we keep
i at generic points and classify all the boundaries into

the xed points z 0
various cases.

10

in the rst case a) all the branch points are kept away from the xed

points z 0

i and we use the following parametrization:

a1 = a1,
a2 = a1 + u,
ai = a1 + u vi2,

i = 3,    , n  6,

(27)
(28)
(29)

and consider the limit u  0 and vis nite. the integration over all ai
(i = 1,    , 6) changes to an integration over u, a1, vi and the rest ajs.

in the second case b) a subset of the branch points approach one of the

points of z 0

i and we use the following parametrization:

a1 = z 0
aj = z 0

i + u,
i + u vj1,

j = 2,    , n  6,

(30)
(31)

and also consider the limit u  0 and vis nite. the integration over all ai
(i = 1,    , 6) changes to an integration over u, vi and the rest ajs.

the third case is a combination of the rst two cases and its niteness
is proved if we can prove the niteness in the rst two cases. in each cases
the integration over z4 must also be considered to obtain the most singular
behaviour.

it is straightforward to compute the behaviour of the various factors un-
der various degeneration limits. in particular the function t under various
degeneration limit u  0 behaves as follows:

ln |u|, a2  a1,
1
|u|,
a2,3  a1,
ln |u|
|u|2 , a2,3,4  a1,

in the last column we have put all factors together and one sees quite

in this appendix we gave some details [3, 8] in proving the independence of
the heterotic string amplitude on the parameter r. let us rst recall eq. (7)

and ii(r) are dened as the singular terms of i(r) times some factors as

in deriving eq. (33) we have used the property of t under the sl(2, c) linear
fractional transformation. it gives the following identities:

n = 1,

(38)

now we prove that all terms containing ii(r) give total derivative terms.
the formula for ii(r) (i = 1, 2, 3) is already given in eq. (8) and the formula
for i4(r) is

of t with respect to a4 in terms of the derivatives of ai (i = 1, 2, 3):

appendix b

in this appendix we give the complete 4-graviton amplitude, the kinematic
factor and collect some formulas used in the discussion of the type ii super-
strig case. the vertex operator for the emission of a graviton with momentum
k and polarization tensor  is

v (k, ; z, z) =  : (zx(z, z) + ik  (z)(z))

(zx(z, z) + ik  (z) (z)) eikx(z,z) : .

(41)

the complete two-loop 4-graviton amplitude is
