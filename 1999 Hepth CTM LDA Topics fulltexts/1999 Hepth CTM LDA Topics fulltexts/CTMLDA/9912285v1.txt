abstract

we study some consequences of dimensionally reducing systems
with massless fermions and abelian gauge elds from 3 + 1 to 2 + 1
dimensions. we rst consider fermions in the presence of an external
abelian gauge eld. in the reduced theory, obtained by compactify-
ing one of the coordinates a la kaluza-klein, magnetic ux strings
are mapped into domain wall defects. fermionic zero modes, localized
around the ux strings of the 3 + 1 dimensional theory, become also
zero modes in the reduced theory, via the callan and harvey mecha-
nism, and are concentrated around the domain wall defects. we also
study a dynamical model: massless qed4, with fermions conned
to a plane, deriving the eective action that describes the planar
system.

1 introduction

topological defects in quantum eld theory [1] play an important role in the
description of many interesting phenomena, both in high energy and con-
densed matter physics applications. being part of the non-perturbative spec-
trum, the understanding of their properties demands the study of topological
classes of the eld conguration space, and the realization of the associated
topological invariants in the model under consideration. for some systems
containing fermions, fermionic zero modes arise whenever the topological
charge is dierent from zero. this eect has many important consequences
for the study of the low momentum eective theory. moreover, since they
are gapless excitations, they will strongly aect the response functions of the
model [2].

in this paper we are concerned with the relationship between topological
defects and zero modes in theories related by dimensional reduction.
in
particular, for the concrete example of fermions in 3 + 1 dimensions coupled
to an abelian gauge eld, we shall derive the low-momentum eective action
for the dimensionally reduced theory. being originally a massless theory,
the momentum scale will be xed by the inverse of the compactication
length. also, as it will be explained, quantum corrections coming from all
the kaluza-klein modes have to be included, to be consistent with large
gauge invariance.

we will rst consider the case of massless dirac fermions in the presence
of an external abelian eld. we then go on to consider a dynamical model:
massless qed in 3 + 1 dimensions. the reduction is here introduced for the
fermions, assumed to be conned to a planar spatial region. being the only
sources of the gauge eld, this induces a reduction also for the gauge eld,
regardless of the fact that it is apriori unconned. for this system we derive
the eective theory, showing that there is room for the existence of stripe
defects, i.e, localized zero modes that appear due to changes in the sign of
the fermionic mass. this is just a manifestation of the well known callan
and harvey mechanism [3]. when there is translation invariance along one
of the spatial directions, the dynamics of the defects is governed by a sine-
gordon like action. moreover, the soliton charge is linked to the number of
zero modes.

the organization of this paper is as follows:

in section 2, we consider
fermions in the presence of an external (non-dynamical) gauge eld, in 3 + 1
dimensions. to take into account quantum eects, section 3 deals with the

2

evaluation of the eective action using a derivative expansion approximation
for the fermionic determinant. in section 4, we derive the low-momentum
eective theory for the interacting case of massless qed4. finally, section 5
is devoted to the conclusions.

2 non-interacting case

by non-interacting we refer to a model containing a fermionic eld  in the
presence of an external (i.e., non-dynamical) gauge eld a. the euclidean
action for the present case is simply dened by

where

sf = z d4x  6d

6d = d d =  + iea .

(1)

(2)

we shall adopt the convention that indices from the beginning of the greek
alphabet always run over the values 0, 1, 2, 3 while those from the end belong
to the set 0, 1, 2 and are reserved for the coordinates of the reduced spacetime.
the third spatial coordinate, x3, is compactied: 0  x3  l, and shall be
sometimes also denoted s, to emphasize its special role, as opposed to the
uncompactied coordinates, x.

we shall rst be concerned with congurations corresponding to mag-
netic ux strings in 3 + 1 dimensions, with the strings entirely contained in
the reduced hyperplane x3 = 0 1. these congurations are here considered
regardless of the mechanism which may create them. to have these magnetic
eld structures, special gauge eld congurations are required. beforehand,
we will use part of the gauge freedom to restrict the external gauge eld
congurations to the ones satisfying the condition:

3a3 = 0 ,

(3)

which can always be fullled, by performing a regular gauge transformation
connected to the identity. with this choice, a3(x, s)  a3(x),

a3(x)

l z l

dsas(x, s)

(4)

1this is rather dierent to the more standard situation of a ux tube pointing in the

x3 direction, and thus corresponding to a magnetic vortex in 2 + 1 dimensions.

3

besides considering static magnetic ux strings, we would also like to
include a small gauge eld conguration in order to nd the eective action.
the strings, being topological objects, should be treated non-perturbatively,
while the small part is assumed to be intrinsically perturbative.

in 3 + 1 dimensions, the magnetic eld components bi (i = 1, 2, 3) are,
as usual, dened by bi = ijkjak. as the ux strings lay on the x3 = 0
plane, the third normal component of the magnetic eld vanishes: b3 = 0.
moreover, we can generate the two non-vanishing components b1, b2 using
a gauge eld such that a1 = a2 = 0, and a3 6= 0. with this choice,

bi(x) = ijj a3(x) .

(5)

it is evident that, from the point of view of the reduced, planar theory,
a3 is a scalar eld under transformations mapping the plane onto itself. it
is convenient to use the denition a3(x) = (x), with x  (x0, x1, x2), to
make explicit the fact that a3 behaves like a scalar.

in the case of a ux string along the x1 axis, the magnetic eld is:

b1 =  (x3)(x2) ,

(6)

where  is a constant 2.

we need to write now a gauge eld conguration leading to the magnetic
eld of (6). there are of course many possibilities but, interestingly enough,
if we want to dimensionally reduce the theory, this freedom is substantially
reduced. the reason is that we do not want a gauge eld conguration
having a nontrivial x3 dependence far away from the x3 = 0 hyperplane.
the natural choice is then a gauge eld strongly concentrated on x3 = 0,
and this determines the gauge eld conguration to be of the form:

a3(x) =


2

(x3)sign(x2) ,

which implies, for the 2 + 1 dimensional scalar eld

(x) =


2l

sign(x2) .

(7)

(8)

the constant  is, of course, related to the (quantized) total ux of the
e , where k is an integer, counting the number of elementary

string, thus  = 2k
uxes.

2this -like conguration is, of course, an idealization. realistic congurations will be,

although highly concentrated, regular functions.

4

we note the emergence of a step-like conguration for the scalar eld.
this scalar eld, as we shall see next, plays the role of the mass for 2 + 1
dimensional fermions. hence, invoking the callan and harvey mechanism [3],
we see that there are zero modes concentrated on the walls, which indeed
correspond to the dimensionally reduced version of the zero modes around
the ux strings. it is worth noting that the scalar eld prole is discontinuous
because of the assumed -like prole for the magnetic eld. it is convenient
to use instead a regular prole,

(x) =


2l

h(x2)

where h(x2) is a smoothed version of the step function, for example

h(x2) = tanh(

x2


)

(9)

(10)

where  is a length which essentially measures the width of the stripe.

to discuss issues related to the fermionic zero modes, like the relationship
between the number of modes in 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions, a more detailed
study of the fermionic action (1) is required. the full gauge eld conguration
(perturbative plus non-perturbative) is assumed to be s-independent. this
simplifying assumption allows us to take advantage of the fact that the gauge
eld a3 is independent of s = x3 to fourier expand the fermionic elds:

(x, x3) =

(x, x3) =

1

xn=
xn=

einx3n(x)

einx3 n(x) ,

(11)

with n = 2n/l . we then obtain for sf a representation as a series of
decoupled 2 + 1 dimensional actions

sf =

+

xn=

sf,n .

(12)

the explicit form for the action sf,n corresponding to each fourier mode is:

sf,n = z d3x n(x)[d + i3(n + e)] n(x) .

(13)

we assume the dirac matrices are in the representation:

0 =   0 3

0 ! 1 =   0 1

3

1

0 ! 2 =   0 2

2

0 ! 3 =   0
ii

ii

0 !

(14)
where j, with j = 1, 2, 3, denote the usual pauli matrices, and i is the 2 2
identity matrix. writing each four-component fermionic eld n in terms of
two 2-component fermions (a)

n , (a = 1, 2), we see that

n (6 d + n + e)(1)

sf,n = z d3x h (1)
n (x)i . (15)
we have introduced the notation 6 d to refer to the dirac operator in 2 + 1
dimensions, acting on 2-component fermions. more explicitly,

n (x)(6 d  n  e)(2)

n + (2)

6 d = d

(16)

with 0  3, and j (j = 1, 2) again denoting the usual pauli matrices. the
covariant derivative depends on a gauge eld which, in our approximation,
is a function of x only.

it is important to realize that all the fermionic modes should be kept
if large gauge invariance is to be preserved, since large gauge invariance
amounts to shifts in , and this eld is directly coupled to the fermionic
eld.

it is now easy to study the callan and harvey fermionic zero modes of the
reduced theory, assuming that in the original model in 3 + 1 dimensions the
background produced a non-vanishing, quantized, magnetic ux. we rst
realize that the decomposition (12) shows that there is an innite number
of 2 + 1 dimensional dirac fermions, each fourier mode consisting of two
avours, distinguished by the sign of their mass terms. a callan and harvey
zero mode for the fourier component n shall appear whenever n + e(x)
crosses zero more or less sharply. thus, the conguration (8) (in its smooth
version (9)) shows that there is at least a zero mode for the n = 0 component,
but, if there is a ux string with charge k , the scalar eld prole will cross
as many values of n, implying that there are, indeed, k zero modes in the
reduced theory. to see this, we take into account the expression (9) for the
domain wall conguration. the equation determining the locii of the zero
modes may be written as

h(x2) =

2
k  integer ,

6

(17)

where k is the (xed) number of elementary uxes. in figure 1 we show, as
an example, the case of a stripe conguration h with k = 9. the horizontal
lines correspond to dierent ns, and a zero mode is produced whenever one
of these lines intersects the curve.

figure 1: a stripe conguration of charge 9

it is interesting to realize that a proper understanding of the relation
between the height of the stripe and the number of zero modes requires the
use of the smoothed version of the steplike scalar eld conguration. this
should be evident from figure 1, if one imagines the curve to be deformed
to a steplike conguration.

we remark that the zero modes produced in this way are massless dirac
fermions in 1 + 1 dimensions, because each avour produces a given chirality,
and the signs are opposite.

3 derivative expansion for the fermionic de-

terminant

we shall now consider the evaluation of the fermionic determinant, as a
functional of a and , in a derivative expansion approximation. the eld
a denotes the perturbative part of the gauge eld.

7

to avoid any risk of confusion, we shall, from now on, use two-component
fermions only. the eective action f [, a] is dened as the result of func-
tionally integrating out the fermionic elds. using the fourier decomposition
for the x3 = s coordinate, we see that

ef [,a] = z

 exp(

n (6 d + n + e)(1)
[ (1)

n + (2)

n (6 d  n  e)(2)

n ]) .

(18)

thus f may be written in terms of fermionic determinants in 2 + 1 dimen-
sions:

+

f [, a] = 

x{ln det(6 d + n + e) + ln det(6 d  n  e)]}
= 

tr lnh 6 d2 + (n + e)2i .

(19)

large gauge transformations wind up a number of times around the pe-
riodic coordinate, s. then they correspond to constant shifts in the scalar
eld :

2n
el

where n is an integer.
it is now clear, from the general expression (19),
that all the fourier modes must be kept, if invariance under (20) is to be
maintained.

(20)

,

in the derivative expansion technique, which we shall use in order to
evaluate f , the leading, zero derivative term, can usually be treated ex-
actly. this term may be thought of as depending basically on the constant
component of the elds. the following terms in the derivative expansion
depend of course also on the uctuating part, which is assumed to be small
in comparison with the constant part.

the piece of the eective action depending on the constant part is usually
regarded as an eective potential. in our case, there is no point in keeping
a constant part for a since, if present, it could be gauged away (because
the planar system is assumed to have a trivial topology). from (20), it is
evident that to keep a constant component for  is, in turn, crucial. we thus
decompose  into two pieces,

8

(21)
where the constant 0 = h(x)i denotes the (x) spacetime average of (x),
and (x) = (x)  0. then we factorize a constant eld determinant,

(x) = 0 + (x) ,

f [, a] = f [0, 0] + f [ , a]

where

f [0, 0]  z d3xvef f () =

tr lnh 6 2 + (n + e0)2i

and

[ , a] =

xn=
tr lnh1 + e(6   n  e0)1(i 6 a  )i .
xn=

(22)

(23)

(24)

we have introduced the notation vef f  under the integral symbol in (23),
to emphasize the property that it will play the role of an eective potential
for . at the end of the evaluation, we shall follow the common practice
of replacing 0 by  in vef f . this approximation is justied within the
derivative expansion technique, as long as the hypothesis leading to that
expansion are valid [4, 5].

large gauge invariance means that this potential is a periodic function of
. the constant eld determinant is evaluated by taking the functional and
dirac traces in momentum space:

(25)

(26)

to evaluate the sum over n, we follow techniques of standard application in
nite temperature quantum eld theory [6]. we rst take advantage of the
fact that the series runs from n =  to n = +, to write

f [0, 0] = z d3x

n=+

xn=z

each one of the terms in (27) may be evaluated by translating known results
about the free energy for a system of free bosons [6], what yields,

d3p

f [0, 0] = z d3x z

(2)3 nln[1  el(p+ie0)] + ln[1  el(pie0]o ,

(28)
where we have ignored the zero point contribution, since it is a -indepen-
dent constant. we shall, however, x the ambiguity in the renormalization
of this innite constant by demanding that the vef f vanishes at its minima.
the integral over p can be performed, and the result can be presented as

(30)

let us next consider the remaining part of the eective action, denoted
f [ , a]. besides a dependence on 0, it will also depend on  (the uctu-
ating part of ) and a.

to be consistent with the derivative expansion, and also because both 
and a are proportional to the same coupling constant e, the expansion must
treat both elds as a single entity 3. to this end, we have found illuminating
to dene a new vector eld , which summarizes the information on the a
and  congurations, through the relations

 = ea

 = e (x) .

(31)

3indeed, they originate in dierent components of the same 3 + 1 dimensional gauge

eld a.

10

of course, this involves the assumption that the lorentz gauge   a = 0 has
been adopted for the gauge eld. the number of independent components
for  is three, since this eld is, in principle, not constrained by any gauge
invariance requirement, and this matches the number of components for the
transverse a (two) plus the scalar elds (one). using trivial properties of the
-matrices in 2 + 1 dimensions, we observe that f ( , a) may be written
as



f [ , a] = 

xn=ntr ln[1 + (6  + n + e0)1(6  6 )]

+   } .

(32)

because of its explicit lorentz covariance, this expression could be regarded
as a consistency check for the procedure of introducing  as a lorentz vector.
taking into account the fact that (32) is explicitly even under parity

transformations, we may write

f [, a] = even[  f]

(33)

where the even label refers to the behaviour under parity transformations,
and f = a. the particular dependence of f on its arguments is
due to the fact that:

 = e

1
2 (  f) .

(34)

we calculate the leading term in a derivative expansion for f , by
noting that, expanding up to second order in derivatives the 2+1 dimensional
object

[] = tr ln[1 + (6  + n + e0)1(6  6 )] ,

we obtain

[] =

e2

24|n + e0| z d3xh(  f)(  f)i .

then we easily see that

namely, it corresponds to a local maxwell term for a and a local kinetic

in summary, the eective action induced by the integration of the fermio-

nic degrees of freedom is, to second order in a derivative expansion:

where we have replaced 0 by  in the contributions from the eective poten-
tial (30) and the subleading term in the derivative expansion of the fermionic
determinant (37). as already mentioned, this procedure is justied within
the derivative expansion approximation.

4 massless qed4

in previous sections, a was just a background for the fermion elds. here,
we shall incorporate a maxwell action so that a becomes dynamical. we
then start from qed4 with the fermionic eld constrained to the region
0  x3  l. the abelian gauge eld is, in principle, dened on an uncon-
strained region. however, its dynamics is determined entirely by the sources,
which are, indeed, conned to 0  x3  l. when the momenta involved in
the processes are small in comparison with the scale l1, an eective the-
ory can be obtained for the relevant degrees of freedom, which describe the
dynamics on the plane x3 = 0. this eective model contains dirac fermions
in interaction with a dynamical abelian gauge eld, and with an (also dy-
namical) scalar eld, in 2 + 1 dimensions. the spectrum of this theory also
contains stripes: (dirac) fermionic zero modes localized on linear defects.

our starting point shall be to consider a model dened in terms of s, the

action for massless qed in four euclidean dimensions

s = sf + sg ,

(39)

where sf and sg denote the fermionic and gauge eld parts of the action,
respectively. they are given by

sf = z d4x (x) 6d (x)

,

6d = 6  + ie 6a

(40)

12

and

sg = z d4x

1
4

ff , f = a  a .

(41)

we assume that the gauge eld components, a, are dened over the full
four-dimensional euclidean spacetime, so that the integration region in (41)
is unbounded.

the fermionic eld is, in turn, dened on a region of small width l in
the third spatial dimension, namely: 0  x3  l, to simulate the physical
situation of fermions in a quasi planar system. there are, of course, many
dierent choices for the boundary conditions of the fermionic eld at x3 = 0
and x3 = l, all of them compatible with current conservation. in principle,
the most natural one would be to impose the vanishing of the normal compo-
nent of the current on the borders, namely, j3 = 0 at x3 = 0, l. although
this condition is natural, it is not an easy one to deal with from the point
of view of the calculation, because it explicitly breaks translation invariance
along x3. to avoid this technical inconvenience, we prefer to use the simpler
assumption that the fermionic eld is l-periodic in x3. this allows us to
fourier expand in that coordinate. from the point of view of the eective
physics in the 0  x3  l region (the dimensionally reduced theory), both
choices should lead to qualitatively similar results. the important point is,
as we shall see, that the existence of a nite dimension allows for a descrip-
tion in terms of an innite number of fermionic modes in the dimensionally
reduced spacetime. the precise nature of the boundary conditions will of
course aect the details of this phenomenon, like the spacing between the
fermionic modes, but not the gross features and properties of the system.

the properties and objects we shall be concerned with can all be obtained,
in principle, from the knowledge of z[j; , ], the generating functional of
greens functions
ds(ja +  + )# (42)
z[j; , ] = z dad d exp"s +z d3xz l

0

with s as dened in (39). as we are interested exclusively in the phenomena
localized on the x3 = 0 plane, both the external source j, and the fermionic
current ie  are conned to the 0  s  l region.
it is evident that, from the point of view of the description of the physics
on the x3 = 0 plane, the action for the gauge eld yields more information
than what is actually needed in our situation, since we are not going to
consider processes with sources outside the region 0  x3  l. it is possible,

13

as we shall see, to obtain a 2 + 1 dimensional action describing precisely the
planar dynamics, and containing fermion and gauge elds with support on
the x3 = 0 plane.
in a sense, we are going to integrate out gauge eld
modes, corresponding to excitations lying outside the plane.

as a rst step, let us see how to pass to a description where the relevant
gauge eld dynamics is determined by an eective 2 + 1 dimensional gauge
eld action. we may write sj
g, the part of the action which involves the
gauge eld and its source, as follows:

sj

g[a, j] = sg[a] + sgf [a] + z d4x j(x)a(x)

(43)

where we have included a gauge xing term, sgf [a], which, for the sake of
simplicity, we take to be of the feynman type 4.

sgf = z d4x

1
2

(  a)2 .

(44)

j stands for the full current, namely, the external source for the gauge
eld j plus the fermionic current ie (x)(x). we then integrate out the
gauge eld, obtaining a non-local current-current interaction:

where

z da exp{sj

g[a, j]} = exp{snl[j]}

snl[j] = 

1

2 z d4x d4y j(x) k(x  y) j(y)

with k(x  y) denoting the (feynman gauge) gauge eld propagator:

k(x  y) = z

d4k

(2)4 eik(xy) 
k2 .

(45)

(46)

(47)

taking now into account the fact that the current j vanishes when either
x3 < 0 or x3 > l, we see that (46) may be written more precisely as follows:

snl[j] = 

1

2 z d3xz l

0

ds1z d3yz l

0

ds2 j(x, s1)k(x  y, s1  s2)j(y, s2) .

but the calculations become more involved.

j(x) =

dsj(x, s) .

(49)

in the l  0 limit, the current may be taken to be approximately x3 inde-
pendent, at least from the eective theory point of view, since a dependence
on x3 in this length scale would correspond to a momentum component com-
parable to the scale l1. thus, we can replace in (48) j(x, s) by its average
j(x), dened by

on the other hand, regarding the propagator, as 0  s1,2  l, we may

use the approximation

therefore, (46) reduces to a non local current-current interaction snl in

k2

ks(x  y) = z

d3k

.

.

(54)

(55)

notice that from now on k denotes the three dimensional momentum vector.
ks is treated separately, because a3 behaves in fact as a scalar eld under
spacetime coordinate transformations in the x3 = 0 hyperplane.

15

it is important to realize that the 2+1 dimensional current j is conserved:

 j = 0 .

(56)

this follows from the fact that the current is approximately x3-independent,
in particular: 3j3 = 0, plus the usual continuity equation j = 0. then
we may actually replace  in (54) by its transverse part:


 =  

kk
k2

.

(57)

summarizing, the result of integrating out the gauge eld may, in the small-l
limit, be represented in terms of an eective 2 + 1 dimensional action

snl[ j] =

l2

2 z d3xz d3y j(x) k 
2 z d3xz d3y js(x) ks(x  y) js(y)

(x  y) j(y)

l2

+

with k 

 as in (54), but with 

 instead of .

this eective action snl[ j ] for the currents, can be equivalently rewritten
as arising from the integration of a gauge eld a, and a scalar eld , both
dened in the three dimensional space-time x3 = 0. in other words, we can
express the above action as the result of functionally integrating out (in 2 + 1
dimensions) a gauge eld a and a scalar eld , with the following action:

(58)

(59)

nl[ j; a, ] =
s

2 z d3xz d3y a(x) k 1



(x  y) a(y)

+

2 z d3xz d3y (x) k 1

+ z d3x j 

(x)a(x) + z d3x j 

s (x  y) (y)
s(x)(x) ,

where j 
(x) = l j(x). note that the inclusion of this factor l in the deni-
tion of the current reduces by one its mass dimensions, as it corresponds to
the transition from fermionic elds in 3 + 1 dimensions to 2 + 1 dimensions.
the bosonic elds, a and , have the same mass dimension than their 3 + 1
dimensional counterparts, because they are equipped with unusual, non-local
kinetic terms.

16

because of current conservation, we may also write a gauge invariant
nl[ j; a, ], by introducing the longitudinal part of a into the

form for s 
game, obtaining:

nl[ j; a, ] =
s

(60)

where f = a  a. this gauge invariant form should, of course, be
gauge xed in order to recover a regular action.
we have thus re-derived a known result: the electromagnetic interaction
due to a maxwell action, if restricted to charges living on a planar section of
space, can be reproduced by introducing a non-local gauge invariant action
in 2 + 1 dimensions, like in [11, 12]. this is of course dierent to the usual,
kaluza-klein like dimensional reduction prescription and in fact is closer
to an alternative prescription proposed in [14]. to understand the basic
dierences between the two prescriptions, let us concentrate in the case of a
scalar eld in 3 + 1 dimensions with action

s(3+1) =

1

2 z d4x

(61)

with propagator k 3+1 satisfying in coordinate space the usual green function
equation

so that in coordinate and momentum (minkowski) space one has,

 2k (3+1)(x) = (x)

k (3+1)(x) = 
k (3+1)(k) = 

42i

(x0)2  (x1)2  (x2)2  (x3)2  i0
(k0)2  (k1)2  (k2)2  (k3)2 + i0

(62)

(63)

(64)

the usual kaluza-klein dimensional reduction consists in this case in drop-
ping k2
kk in the reduced space obeys
the analogous to (62),

3 in eq.(64). then, the propagator k (2+1)

 2k (2+1)

kk (x) = (x)

(65)

17

so that the reduced scalar theory corresponds to an action

s(2+1)
kk =

1

2 z d3x

(66)

the alternative prescription which leads to the reduction presented here cor-
responds to dropping x3 in (63). to see this, note that if one puts x3 = 0,
the propagator k (2+1) does not satisfy anymore (65) but instead, as can be
easily seen,



2k (2+1)(x) = (x)

(67)

so that the dynamics of the reduced scalar theory is governed by the action

s(2+1) =

1

2 z d3x

1

2



(68)

which is precisely the non-local action for the scalar eld in (60). an analo-
gous result, coinciding again with that in (60) can be found for a vector eld
like a.

let us note that in the case in which the dimensional reductions is jus-
tied by the fact that the physical system is (quasi) planar, the alternative
prescription which consists in dropping x3, eectively compels the system
to evolve in a plane keeping the nature of the interaction unchanged:
for
example, if in 3 + 1 dimensions electrons interact via a 1/r potential, they
still interact through this potential in 2 + 1 but with the third coordinate
constrained to be zero. in contrast, the usual kaluza-klein prescription not
only reduces the space but also changes drastically the nature of the inter-
action:
in the example above, the electron interaction would change from
1/r to log r. if planar electrons are supposed to be subjected to 3 + 1 inter-
actions even when they are compelled to move in the plane, the alternative
prescriptions then appears to be more physical than the usual kaluza-klein
one.

the prize one pays when using the alternative prescription is the non-
locality of the reduced action. it is interesting to note that, if looked at from
the point of view of minkowski spacetime, this non-locality is due to a branch
cut singularity starting at zero momentum. amusingly enough, this kind of
singularity is entirely analogous to the one that appears when one considers
the vacuum polarization function for massless fermions in 2 + 1 dimensions.
in that case, the branch cut singularity is of course due to the possibility of

18

pair-creating fermions on-shell for any gauge eld conguration with a non-
zero momentum. the situation is, however, dierent to the dimensional
reduction of our example, since the singularity here corresponds to modes
that have been integrated out, and are in principle out of the spectrum of
physical states. thus the model is to be regarded as an open system, since
the unitarity relations corresponding to a closed system would in turn require
the introduction of asymptotic massless fermionic excitations into the game,
like in the case of (unitary) massless qed in 2 + 1 dimensions.

the reduction of the fermionic part of the action proceeds as in section 2,
while the evaluation of the fermionic determinant has already been presented
in section 3.

5 discussion and conclusions

so far we have obtained the eective action for the gauge elds (60), after
reducing the original gauge action from 3 + 1 to 2 + 1 dimensions, and the
one for the fermionic degrees of freedom (eq.( 38)), after integrating out the
fermions. the nal result is:

we see that the dynamics for the eld that provides an induced mass for
the fermions, , is given by a non-local interaction term, and a series of sine-
gordon like term. it is also through a series that is a functional of  that
this last eld couples to a.

as mentioned above, non-local eective theories for the electrodynamics
of particles moving on a plane were discussed in [11]-[13]. in particular, a
lagrangian containing a non-local maxwell term plus a coupling to matter
current conned to a plane and coinciding with the rst line in lagrangian
(60) was obtained in [12] where it was proven that this eective 2+1 non-local
lagrangian was equivalent to one in which the current term is replaced by a
chern-simons term. this last lagrangian describes precisely the bosonized

19

version of a 2 + 1 massless fermion theory [11] and, as shown in [13], this is
not a coincidence. indeed, the functional approach to bosonization [15]-[16]
for 2 + 1 free dirac fermions with mass m, leads to a bosonization recipe
which is exact for the matter current:

j (x)

a

(70)

concerning the bosonic action, it cannot be written explicitly, except for
certain particular limits. in particular, in the vanishing mass limit one can
compute exactly the bosonic action [13] obtaining a result which coincides
with the rst line in eq.(60) (if one uses (70) to bosonize the matter current).
it is worth emphasizing here that we have not started from a 2 + 1 model but
rather from massless qed4, and that the reduction mechanism explained
above brings into play, besides the usual a eld, also an scalar eld  which
has a non-trivial, sine-gordon like dynamics and it is moreover coupled to
a. the necessity for the existence of this eld may be traced back of course
to the fact that the compactied dimension allows for a certain non-trivial
structure in that direction, reected in the large gauge transformations of
which the scalar eld is the subject.

to nish this discussion we look at the propagation of fermions in a (a, )
in a rst approximation, the dynamics of these background
background.
elds could be regarded as entirely determined by the eective action (69)
only, and as a next step one should introduce the reaction of the fermionic
elds on the bosons. looking back at the action (18) for the fermions in
2 + 1, we see that for each species (1)
n , there will be a fermionic zero
mode every time n + e passes through zero, i.e, when e =  2n
l . these
zero modes are produced because of the callan and harvey mechanism, since
there is a change of sign for the mass term of a 2 + 1 dimensional fermion.
since we have two 2-component fermions, and their mass terms have opposite
signs, there shall be two chiral fermions, of opposite chiralities, localized
around each defect. this is of course equivalent to saying that we shall have
a massless dirac fermionic zero mode around each defect. the existence
of these gapless zero modes has of course relevance for the calculation of
transport properties.

n and (2)

if we restrict ourselves to congurations having an approximate invariance
under translations along one of the spatial coordinates, the eective action
for the  eld will of course be the one of a two dimensional eld theory with
a potential periodic in the eld, and with an unusual kinetic term. despite

20

this last property, the periodic nature of the potential implies that there is
room for the existence of a non-trivial topological charge q, dened as for the
case of the sine-gordon model. if the system is invariant under translations
in x2, then

q =

el

2 z +



dx11(x) =

el
2

[(+)  ()] .

(71)

a conguration of denite charge q = q, corresponds to the eld  starting
in one of the minima at x1 =  and covering q periods of the potential
before nishing at another minimum of the potential, at x1 = +. we may
assume, for the sake of clarity, that the eective potential is identical to the
rst component of the series. then, there will be exactly q fermionic zero
modes, since they appear each time the potential passes through a maxi-
mum. this discussion shows that there is an interesting relation between the
topological solitonic charge and the number of fermionic zero modes.
