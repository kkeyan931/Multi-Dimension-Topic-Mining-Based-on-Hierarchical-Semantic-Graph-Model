abstract

we study dirac commutators of canonical variables on d-branes with a con-

stant neveu-schwarz 2-form eld by using the dirac constraint quantization

method, and point out some problems appearing in some previous works in

analyzing constraint structure of the brane system. overcoming some ad hoc

procedures, we obtain desirable noncommutative coordinates exactly compat-

ible with the result of the conformal eld theory in recent literatures. further-

more, we nd interesting commutator relations of other canonical variables.

noncommutative geometry arises in d-branes on constant antisymmetric tensor elds [1],

and gauge theories on the noncommutative space have been studied by seiberg and witten

[2,3]. the fundamental commutator relations of open string coordinates xi on the branes

are represented by noncommutativity, [xi(0,  ), xj(0,  )] = iij where ij is an antisymmetric

constant tensor depending on the background constant elds. the noncommutativity on

the branes is intensively studied in terms of their bound states [46]. furthermore, the

noncommutativity in matrix model with non-trivial three form eld has been observed in

ref. [1].

on the other hand, recent studies [79] show that noncommutative coordinates on the

brane coupled to constant antisymmetric background elds can be derived from the hamil-

tonian formulation of the system by treating the mixed boundary condition as a primary

constraint. the stability of the primary constraint with respect to time gives innite number

of secondary constraints where the lagrangian multiplier ui implemented by the primary

constraint was determined as ui = 0. the resulting constraints between the primary and the

secondary constraints form second class algebra, and dirac brackets between the coordinates

on the brane yield the noncommutative coordinates which are coincident with the known

result. however, coordinates of the bulk part are also noncommutative and at rst sight the

noncommutativity seems to appear both at the boundary and the bulk. this might be due

to an ad hoc procedure in determining lagrange multiplier. so, in the stability condition of

the mixed boundary condition in refs. [79], the multiplier in the primary hamiltonian can

not be xed as ui = 0 if the antisymmetric elds are invertible. then a proper choice of the

multiplier does not generate the aforementioned innite number of secondary constraints,

and in this brane system the primary constraint itself forms the second class constraint

algebra.

the intriguing point adopted in refs. [79] for the hamiltonian formulation is to dis-

cretize the string world sheet as xn (n = 0, 1, 2   ) where x0 describes the boundary of the

open string and the others are for the bulk, and the noncommutative structure of boundary

and the bulk part can be studied respectively.

2

in this paper, we shall reconsider dirac constraint quantization of the brane on the

constant antisymmetric backgrounds and obtain consistent noncommutative commutators

of canonical variables including momenta. compared to the previous works, the essential

dierence comes from the choice of the nonvanishing multiplier in the primary hamiltonian,

which is determined by the stability condition of the primary constraint. in our case, there

are no more secondary constraints, instead, the single primary constraint itself forms the

second class constraint algebra, which gives various kinds of interesting commutators as well

as the expected noncommutative coordinates. in our analysis, coordinates in the bulk part

are commutative, which is drastically dierent from the earlier works.

before proceeding, let us exhibit self-dual constraints appearing in chiral quantum me-

chanics [10] as a simple illustration of noncommutative coordinates, which is very similar to

the constraint system in the open string theory. then the lagrangian is given by

l = 

e
2c

b xiijxj + e(x).

(1)

where it is obtained from a charged point particle coupled to the static potential  on a

strong magnetic eld background in three dimensions. the canonical momenta are

pi =

l
 xi = 

e
2c

bijxj,

(2)

which becomes a primary constraint in this theory. this is called simply self-dual constraint

in that the momenta are represented by the coordinates

i = pi +

e
2c

bijxj  0.

considering a primary hamiltonian [11],

hp = hc + uii,

(3)

(4)

where hc = e and ui is a multiplier, the stability condition of the primary constraint

with respect to time yields

{i, hp} = ei +

e
c

bijuj,

 0.

3

(5)

if the magnetic eld is nonvanishing, it is possible to x the multiplier, whereas for b  0

the additional constraint called a secondary constraint can be generated, so the primary con-

straint together with the secondary constraint form second class constraint system. however,

in our case, the primary constraint itself becomes a second class constraint and the multiplier

can be naturally xed.

now the consistent brackets with the primary constraint are dened as

[a, b] = i{a, b} + i{a, i}

c
eb

ij{j, b},

where a and b are canonical variables and the resulting commutators are

[xi, xj] = i

c
eb

ij,

[xi, pj] =

i
2
[pi, pj] = i

gij,

e
4c

bij.

(6)

(7)

the commutators between the coordinates are noncommuting as well as those of the mo-

menta. in fact, this curious feature is due to the constraint (3) to be imposed on the phase

space, which will be studied in the context of the open string theory.

we now consider the open string theory coupled to constant neveu-schwarz 2-form elds

and u(1) gauge eld background given by

s =

1

4 z d2hax iaxi + 2bijabax ibx ji
+z d ai x i| z d ai x i|0

(8)

where it has a local u(1) gauge invariance. if both ends of a string attached to the same

brane, the last two boundary term in eq.(8) can be written as  1

2 r d fijabax ibx j,

and the action (8) becomes

s =

1

4 z d2hax iaxi + 2fijabax ibx ji

(9)

and the two form eld f = b  f = b  da is invariant under both u(1) and  transfor-

mation dened as b  b + d and a  a + . we simply take fij = 0 in eq. (8) to avoid

the problem of u(1) gauge invariance in the quantized theory [3].

4

varying the action (8) gives the equation of motion, aax i = 0 with the mixed boundary

condition

gijx j + 2bij x j|=0, = 0.

(10)

without the constant background elds bij, the boundary conditions (10) are reduced to

neumann boundary conditions of the open string theory. to distinguish the boundary and

the bulk, we discretize our action (8) along the  parameter [7] and the resulting discretized

lagrangian becomes

l =

1

4 xn (cid:20)( x i

n)2 

1

 (cid:16)x i

n(cid:17)2

n+1  x i

+ 4bij x i

n+1  x j

(11)

n(cid:16)x j

n(cid:17)(cid:21)

where we take equal spacing, r d = pn where the overdot means the derivative with

respect to the time-like parameter  . and we also discretize the mixed boundary condition

(10) as

gij

 (cid:16)x j

1  x j

0(cid:17) + 2bij x j

0 = 0

(12)

where it is simply denoted at the one boundary  = 0 for convenience. from the discretized

lagrangian (11), we obtain canonical momenta given as

2pni = h xni + 2bij(x j

n+1  x j

n)i ,

(13)

where n = 0 and n = 1, 2,    denote the coordinates on the brane and the string bulk, re-

spectively. according to the usual diracs procedure [11], one can dene the mixed boundary

condition (12) as a primary constraint by using eqs.(12) and (13),

1

i =

 h(2)2bijp j

0  (2)2bijbjk(x1k  x0k) + gij(x j

1  x j

(14)

0)i  0.

then the primary hamiltonian can be constructed by performing the legendre transforma-

tion of eq.(11) and by introducing the primary constraint implemented by the multiplier

ui( ), which is given as

hp = hc + uii

=

1

4 xn (cid:20)(2)2(cid:16)p i

n  bij(x n+1

j  x n

j )(cid:17)2

+ (x i

n+1  x i

n)2(cid:21) + uii,

(15)

5

where hc is a canonical hamiltonian.

using poisson brackets dened by

{x i

n, x j

m} = 0 = {p i

n, p j

m},

{x i

n, p j

m} = gijnm,

the time evolution of the primary constraint (14) yields

{i, hp} = 

2

2

(cid:20)bij(cid:16)(2)2p0b  (2)2b2(x1  x0)  (x1  x0)(cid:17)j

(cid:16)g  (2)2b2(cid:17)ij
+(cid:16)g  (2)2b2(cid:17)ij

(p0  b(x1  x0))j

(p1  b(x2  x1))j

+ 2(2)bij(g  (2)2b2)j

kuk( )i

(16)

(17)

where this condition determines the multiplier rather than it generates additional constraints

since bij is invertible [3]. in refs. [79], however, innite chain of constraints appeared as

secondary constraints and it is dierent from the usual dirac quantization procedure. the

essential reason why the multiplier ui can be xed is due to the poisson algebra of the

primary constraint (14) which yields second class constraint algebra as

{i, j} =

2
2 (2)2 [(g  2b)b(g + 2b)]ij .

(18)

it would be interesting to note that for bij  0 the primary constraint becomes rst class

constraint, in that case, the time evolution of the primary constraint by using the primary

hamiltonian gives secondary constraint. these constraints form the second class constraint

algebra and the lagrangian multiplier can be xed.

returning to our analysis, let us now construct the dirac matrix dened by

cij = {i, j},

and the inverse matrix can be obtained as

c ij1

=

2

2(2)2 "

1

(g + (2)b)

b

(g  (2)b)#ij

.

(19)

(20)

then we can calculate dirac commutators straightforwardly by means of the following def-

inition

[a, b] = i{a, b}  i{a, i}c ij1

{j, b}.

(21)

the small constant parameter  can be canceled out in dirac commutators and commutator

relations are valid for the prescription   0 after nishing all dirac procedures. the

resulting commutators at the boundary ( = 0) of the open string are

[x i

0, x j

0] = 

i

(2)2"

(g + (2)b)

(g  (2)b)(cid:21)ij

.

(22)

(23)

(24)

if we redene the phase space variables as x i

0  12

x i

0, then the dirac commutator of

the coordinates (22) is equivalent to the result derived from the propagator by seiberg and

witten in ref. [3]. the commutator relations between the canonical momenta are nontrivial

[7], which is similar to the form of the point particle case on the presence of the magnetic

eld. note that for a point particle limit of   0, the commutation relation for the

coordinates (22) is reduced to [xi( ), xj( )] = i(b1)ij whose form is the same with that of

eq.(7). on the other hand, at the nearest point from the boundary for n = 1, the dirac

commutators are

[x i

1, x j

1] = 0,

[x i

1, p j

1 ] = igij,
i

[p i

1, p j

1 ] =

2(2)2 (cid:20)(g + (2)b)

1
b

(g  (2)b)(cid:21)ij

.

(25)

(26)

(27)

note that commutator relations between the coordinates x i

1 in eq.(25) imply that they

are commuting each other, which is in contrasted with the result of the noncommutative

coordinates [7]. next, the cross commutation relations are also given as

[x i

0, x j

1] = 0,

7

[x i

0, p j

1 ] =

gij,

i
2

[x i

1, p j

0 ] = 0,

[p i

0, p j

1 ] = [p i

0, p j
0 ].

(28)

furthermore, the other dirac commutators for the string bulk, i.e. n = 2, 3,   , are the

same with the usual poisson brackets,

[x i

n, x j

m] = 0 = [p i

n, p j

m],

[x i

n, p j

m] = inmgij.

(29)

from eqs.(22)-(29), we nd that the boundary coordinate x i

0 is nontrivially correlated

with the other canonical variables for n = 0, 1, whereas the coordinate x i

1 is commuting

with other canonical variables except its conjugate momentum p i

1. this fact is drastically

dierent from the earlier works.

the similar commutators for the  =  boundary of the d-brane are given as

[x i

, x j

] =

[x i

(30)

as a result, the noncommutativity of the coordinates emerges only on the branes not in the

string bulk.

on the other hand, commutation relation of the center of mass(cm) coordinate is cal-

culated as

[x i

(31)

where we used the denition of the center of mass coordinate as x i

0 dx i =



 pn x i

n. the only boundary commutators at  = 0 and  =  contribute to the center

of mass commutation relation. the tilde elds are dened on the  =  boundary of the

brane. as discussed in [7], for the m m brane system, the center of mass commutator is

vanishing while for the m m brane system it is vanishing in this discretized version. in ref.

[7], noncommutative coordinate relations of the boundary and the bulk contribute to the

calculation of the commutation relation of the center of mass coordinates. however, in our

case, if   0, then the commutator relation of the center of mass coordinates is always

vanishing.

it seems to be appropriate to comment on the nontrivial commutator relations between

coordinates and momenta. at rst sight, one might wonder why the coordinate x i

0 is related

to the momentum p i

1 through the commutation relation as seen in eq.(28). as a matter of

fact, this is due to the structure of the primary constraint (14) since it contains the canonical

variables x i

1 and aects the dirac bracket. so the constraint is not only dened at the

boundary point x i

0 but also it is related to the next point x i

1 through the derivative at  = 0

in the mixed boundary condition. strictly speaking, the coordinates are noncommutative

only at the boundary, however, the canonical variables including momenta at the boundary

 = 0 are correlated up to the next canonical variables. as for the canonical momenta, they

are noncommutative for n = 0, 1, whereas for n = 2, 3,    they are commuting.

in conclusions, we have shown that the noncommutative coordinates can be obtained

at the end points of the open string (on the brane) on the constant antisymmetric elds

9

while the bulk coordinates as expected follow the usual commuting relations, which has

been studied in the context of the dirac constraint quantization method without recourse

to the propagator method used in the conformal eld theory.
