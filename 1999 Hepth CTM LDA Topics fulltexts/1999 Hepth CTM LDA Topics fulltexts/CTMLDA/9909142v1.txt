abstract

the periodic bounce congurations responsible for quantum tunneling are

obtained explicitly and are extended to the nite energy case for minisuper-

space models of the universe. as a common feature of the tunneling models

at nite energy considered here we observe that the period of the bounce

increases with energy monotonically. the periodic bounces do not have bifur-

cations and make no contribution to the nucleation rate except the one with

zero energy. the sharp rst order phase transition from quantum tunneling

to thermal activation is veried with the general criterions.

i. introduction

quantum tunneling at nite energy and temperature, the so-called thermally assisted

tunneling, has attracted considerable attention recently in the study of the crossover from

the quantum tunneling domain to the thermal activation (hopping) region. the instanton

method plays a central role in these studies. the probability of tunneling at zero temperature

can be obtained from a micro-cannonical ensemble and has a path integral representation [1].

in the one loop approximation the probability is p = aes where the preexponential factor

a arises from gaussian functional integration over small uctuations around the instanton

solution and s is the euclidean action of an instanton with zero energy.

there are two kinds of tunneling, one of which is tunneling between degenerate vacua induced

by instantons which are stable euclidean eld solutions with nontrivial topological charge.

the instanton can be viewed as an extended particle existing in the barrier interpolating

between degenerate vacua [1]. a (vacuum) bounce is, however, an unstable solution of a

euclidean eld equation with zero topological charge and was well known already decades

ago [2,3]. the initial and end points of a (vacuum) bounce both terminate on a metastable

ground state or false vacuum. the tunneling induced by such a bounce results in the decay

of the false vacuum [4].

quantum tunneling at nite temperature [5] t is dominated by periodic instantons (bounces)

which are periodic solutions of the euclidean equation of motion with nite energy e [6,7]

and in the semi-classical limit the path integral is expected to be saturated by a single

periodic instanton. with exponential accuracy the tunneling probability p(e) at a given

energy e reduces to

p (e)  ew (e) = es()e

(1)

the period  is related to the energy e in the standard way e = s

 and s() is the action of

the periodic instanton (bounce) per period. such periodic instantons (bounces) smoothly in-

terpolate between the zero temperature instantons (bounces) and the static solution named

sphaleron sitting at the top of the potential barrier. the sphaleron is responsible for thermal

hopping. peculiarly the study of explicit periodic instantons and their stability began only

about ten years ago [8,9].

with increasing temperature thermal hopping becomes more and more important and be-

yond some critical or crossover temperature tc becomes the decisive mechanism.

in the

context of quantum mechanics it has been demonstrated that the transition from the ther-

mal to the quantum regime can be considered as a phase transition which is of second-order

with certain assumptions about the shape of the potential [10]. later it was shown that

the situation is not generic and that the crossover from the thermal to the quantum regime

can quite generally be like that of a rst-order phase transition [11]. the sharp rst-order

transition has been conrmed theoretically in several spin tunneling systems [1214] and

triggered active reaserch in various elds in connection with tunneling. in the context of

eld theory not much work has been done toward the study of periodic instantons. recently

there were interesting investigations to show that the crossover from the quantum to the

thermal regime in the vacuum decay with 4 models is essentially a rst-order phase tran-

sition in the thin wall limit [15,16]. it is therefore also a challenging problem to study the

crossover from quantum tunneling to thermal activation in the context of cosmology [17].

here we follow the recent model investigations of the creation of universe in the context of

the so-called minisuperspace models [18], and extend the study of tunneling to nite energy

and temperature.

the characteristic way in which phase transitions appear in quantum mechanical tunneling

processes has been worked out in ref.[11]. in context of eld theory the crossover behaviour

has also been explained in a more transparent manner [19]. a sharp rst order transition

is shown to appear as a bifurcation in the plot of the instanton action s versus period

 (e). the criterion for a rst order transition can be obtained by studying the euclidean

time period in the neighbourhood of the sphaleron as advocated in ref.[20]. if the period

(e  u0) of the periodic instanton (bounce) close to the barrier peak can be found, a
suciet condition to have the rst order transition is seen to be (e  u0)  s < 0 or

3

2 > 2

s , where u0 denotes the barrier height and s is the period of small oscillation around

the sphaleron.  and s are the corresponding frequencies. the frequency of the spaleron s

is nothing but the frequency of small oscillaton in the bottom of the inverted potential well.

a practically useful formula for the criterion of the rst order transition is given in ref.[21]

and the winding number transition in o(3) model with and withoult skyrme term has been

successfully analyzed with the crirerion [22]. in the following the crossover behaviour in the

minisuperspace model is investigated in terms of the general criterion and we also explain

the physics underlying the crossover which may shed light on understanding the time evolu-

tion of the universe in the model. in sec. 2 the quantum tunneling at zero energy is briey

reviewed. we emphasize that the bounce starts and ends on the metastable ground state

which corresponds to a static solution of the eld equation with zero radius and is therefore

meaningful for the decay of the false vacuum. as a prototype model of the creation of the

universe at nite temperature we discuss the similar process of bubble nucleation in sec. 3.

the crossover of the nucleation rate from the quantum to the classical regime is studied in

terms of the general criterions for rst-order phase transitions. in sec. 4 we apply a similar

approach to the cosmological minisuperspace model.

ii. the periodic bounce and quantum tunneling at zero

energy

contemporary cosmological models are based on the idea that the universe is pretty

much the same everywhere  an idea sometimes known as the copernican principle which
is related to two more mathematically precise properties that the manifold might have:

isotropy and homogeneity. we begin with the simplest minisuperspace model of the universe

[18] dened by the action:

s = z d1+n xg(cid:20) r

16gn  v(cid:21)

(2)

where v > 0 is a constant vacuum energy according to ref. [18] and thus plays the role

of the cosmological constant in eq.

(2) and makes the space de sitter or anti-de sitter.

4

the spacetime to be considered is r   where r represents the time direction and  is a
homogeneous and isotropic nmanifold with n = 2 or 3. the universe is also assumed to
be closed. we therefore have:

ds2 = dt2 + 2(t)d2

n

(3)

which is just the robertsonwalker metric of the closed case. the function (t) is known as
the scale factor which tells us how big the spacetime slice  is at time t. d2
n is the metric

on a unit nsphere. substituting the metric eq.(3) into eq.(2) we obtain the lagrangian

l = sn n2" n(n  1)

16gn

(1  2)  2v#

where

sn =

n +1

2

2
( n +1
2 )

(4)

(5)

is the surface of the unit nsphere. it is easy to see that only for n = 3 is  = 0 a static
solution of the equation of motion and thus can serve as the metastable ground state or false

vacuum. the lagrangian for n = 3 can be written

l =

1
2

m() 2  v ()

where m() = m0 is the position dependent mass with m0 = 3

2g . the potential

v () =

m0
2

  3

(6)

(7)

is shown in fig. 1 where  = 22v. the classical solution of the equation of motion in real

time is [18]

(t) =

1


cosh t,

 = s 2

m0

(8)

which shows that the space is the de sitter space expanding at t > 0 from (t = 0) = 1
 .

 = 0 is an additional static solution with energy e = 0. the bounce conguration is

obtained from the euclidean equation of motion by the wick rotation  = it under the

barrier and is seen to be

(9)

we see that the bounce is a periodic solution. the trajectory of this periodic bounce for one

period is shown in fig. 1a. the bounce starts from the false vacuum ( = 0) at imaginary
time  =  
the false vacuum at  = 

2 and reaches the turning point  = 1

 at time  = 0 and then bounces back to

2 . the period of the bounce is

 =




.

(10)

the universe can then be considered to be created spontaneously from nothing ( = 0)

and to tunnel through the barrier (fig. 1) into the de sitter space. the tunneling rate or

decay rate out of the false vacuum can be evaluated in terms of the action of the bounce

and is given by

where

p (e = 0)  ewb

wb = z ( = 

( = 

2 )=0

pb()d =

(12)

here pb denotes the momentum of the bounce and is as usual evaluated from the euclidean

version le of the lagrangian eq.(6), i.e.
le
  |=b = m0 b

pb =

(13)

it may be noted that the bounce here is periodic even though the energy of the false vacuum

is taken to be zero. this is quite unlike the usual case of the bounce at zero energy as,

for example, in the case of the well studied bounce of the inverted double-well potential [4]

where the period of the bounce tends to innity. the periodic bounce with nite period

exists only at nite energy [7].

we now turn to bubble nucleation in the thin wall case as a comparison. when a eld

conguration is trapped in a metastable state, bubbles of the true vacuum state nucleate

6

in the surrounding false vacuum and begin to grow spherically. the process of bubble nu-

cleation is in many ways analogous to the nucleation of the universe. under a number of

simplifying assumptions the nucleating bubble can be adequately described by a minisuper-

space model with a single degree of freedom [18], the bubble radius r(t). the lagrangian of

1 + n dimensions is

l = sn1(cid:20)rn1(1  r2)

1

2  


n

rn(cid:21)

(14)

here  is the tension of the wall, n = 2, 3, and  denotes the dierence in the vacuum energy

on both sides of the wall. the canonical momentum conjugate to the variable r is

p = sn1

and the hamiltonian is

h = hp2 + 2s2

n1r2(n1)i

(15)

(16)

we then obtain a point particle like hamiltonian which is the starting point of our consid-

erations. the energy is conserved in the process of bubble nucleation. for zero energy the

equation h = 0 can be rewritten as

with the eective potential

p2 + u(r) = 0

u(r) = 2s2

(17)

(18)

where r0 = n 

 . we see that for both n = 2 and 3 the vanishing radius r = 0 is a static

solution of the equation of motion with zero energy, namely, the vacuum of our point particle

like system. besides the static solution r = 0 the solution in real time is

r(t) = (r2

0 + t2)

(19)

it is shown in ref. [18] that this solution eq. (19) is the same de sitter space eq. (8)

(20)

in the new imaginary time coordinate  = it the imaginary time solution existing in the

(22)

(23)

(24)

we see that the bubble nucleation is indeed similar to the creation of the universe.

iii. crossover from quantum tunneling to thermal

activation  bubble nucleation

as a prototype for the nucleation of the universe we reconsider the temperature depen-

dence of the bubble nucleation rate. however, we study the crossover from the quantum to

the classical regime in terms of the general criteria for phase transitions [2022]. we consider

the nucleation process at nite energy e. then energy conservation h = e leads to

p2 + u(r, e) = 0

with the eective potential (see fig. 2)

u(r, e) = 2s2

n1"r2(n1)  (

8

(25)

(26)

the periodic bounce at nite energy e is an imaginary time solution which exists in the

barrier between two turning points r (as shown in fig. 2) which are static solutions of the
eld equation (25). the parameters in fig. 2 are dened by

r =

r0

(1  1  ),

e
u0

, u0 =

s1r0

4

(27)

for n = 2. the bounce of eq.(9) is recovered when the energy reduces to zero, e = 0. the

period of the bounce for n = 2 is [15]

(e) = 2 [r+e(k) + rk(k)]

(28)

where k(k) and e(k) denote the complete elliptic integrals of the rst and second kinds
respectively with modulus

k2 = 1 

r2

r2
+

(29)

the period (e) increases monotonically with energy from its minimum value 2r0 at zero

energy to the maximum value r0 at energy e reaching the upper bound at e = u0. when

the bubble with radius r is spontaneously created it may decay through the barrier by
quantum tunneling. the tunneling rate is again calculated from the action of the bounce

[15] (n = 2)

wb = z r( =

(30)

the shape of the potential barrier varies with energy e as shown in fig. 2. when the energy

reaches the upper bound u0 the two static solutions r+, r join at the top of the barrier and
the solution is called the sphaleron

rs =

r0
2

(31)

which plays an important role in the crossover from quantum tunneling to thermal activa-

tion.

9

our main point here is to investigate the transition from the quantum to the classical

regime. the crossover is realized as a phase transition analogous to the landau theory. to

this end we start from a procedure similar to that in ref. [12] where the phase transition in

the tunneling rate of a spin system is discussed. we expand the bounce action wb around

the sphaleron (e  u0,   1, k  0) and use the series expansions of the complete elliptic
integrals

substituting the expansion eq. (32) into eq. (30) the free energy of the bounce, f = e+t w ,

where  = t

is the dimensionless temperature with ts = 1

and s = r0 is the period

of the sphaleron. the analogy with the landau theory of phase transitions described by

f = a2 + b4 + c6 where  is the order parameter is obvious. the factor in front of h

changes its sign at the phase transition temperature ts. the factor in front of h2 has always

the negative sign which indicates the rst-order phase transition [12].

recently the phase transition from quantum to classical regime has been studied exten-

sively. a criterion of the rst-order phase transition has been formulated for the crossover

from quantum tunneling to thermal activation [20,21]. the key point in the procedure is to

investigate the quantum uctuation around the sphaleron. the oscillation frequency around

the sphaleron can be expanded as a perturbation series [21]

2 = 2

s + 12 + 222 +   

(35)

10

where s = 2
s

is the frequency of the sphaleron and  denotes the perturbation parameter.

it is demonstrated [21] that the criterion for the rst-order phase transition 22 > 0

leads to a useful inequality derived from the euclidean equation of motion, i.e., the bounce

trajectory [21], namely

v (3)(rs)(g1 +

v (4)(rs) + m (1)(rs)(g1 +

m (2)(rs)2

s < 0

(36)

where f (n)(rs)  dnf (r)

drn |r=rs is dened as the usual n-th partial derivative at the coordinate

of the sphaleron, and

g1 = 

2
s m (1)(rs) + v (3)(rs)

4v (2)(rs)

,

g2 = 

32
4 [4m(rs)2

sm (1)(rs) + v (3)(rs)
s + v (2)(rs)]

,

m(r) is the mass and is generally position dependent (as for example in eq.(6)). the criterion

for the rst-order phase transition contains only the information of the sphaleron. it is not

necessary to obtain the bounce conguration for the entire region of energy (e = 0 to u0).

we now apply the criterion (36) to the problem of bubble nucleation for both n = 2 and 3.

(37)

which holds for any n. of course, here only the cases n = 2 and 3 are relevant to the

tunneling and the criterion (37) is meaningful.

iv. de sitter minisuperspace model

we consider the tunneling case of n = 3 for the cosmological model of eq.(4). introducing

the energy by h = e, the corresponding integrated euclidean equation of motion reads

1
2

m() 2  v () = e

(38)

the bounce conguration b(, e) at nite energy is obtained and plotted in fig. 1b. the

period of the bounce at nite energy is given by

(39)

(40)

(41)

 are the two turning points shown in fig. 1, and i  +  . the period (e) again
increases monotonically with energy (as shown in fig. 3) from 0 = 
 for e = 0 to the

sphaleron period s = 23 at energy e = u0 = m0

33/2 . the sphaleron is

s =

1
3

12

(42)

the numerically evaluated action of the periodic bounce is shown in fig. 4 where sth = u0
t

denotes the thermal action. since the thermal action is lower than that of the bounce, the

creation rate is dominated by the thermal activation over the barrier similar to the case

of bubble nucleation [15]. it is also evident that the shallow barriers (fig. 1 and 2) favor

the thermal activation. we now turn to the crossover from quantum tunneling to thermal

activation. from the equation of motion (38) we nd

m (1) = m0,

m (2) = 0,

s =

v (1)(rs) = 0,

g1 = 0,

v (2)(rs) = q6m0,
g2 = s 

6m0

= 3,

2
s

v (3)(rs) = 6,

v (4)(rs) = 0,

with the above data the condition for the rst-order phase transition (36) becomes

 q6m0 < 0

(43)

which holds always since  > 0. the phase transition is therefore of rst-order, i.e. the same

as that in the case of bubble nucleation.

the periodic bounce for the minisuperspace model at hand does not possess a bifurcation

(see fig. 4) similar to the o(3)-model in the eletroweak theory [19,22] and is dierent

from that of well studied spin tunneling where the sharp rst order phase transition is a

necessary result of bifurcation in the plot of instanton action versus period. to see the

crossover behaviour clearly we look at the thermal rate (t ) which is constructed from

p(e) by averaging with the boltzmann exponential at temperature t and so equals

(t ) = z 

0

dee e

t p (e)  z 

0

deew (e) e

t

(44)

in the weak coupling limit the integral over energy e can be calculated by the steepest

descent method. only periodic instantons with the period equal to inverse temperature can

dominate the thermal rate. this is called the saddle point condition:

(e) =

1
t

.

13

(45)

in our case the saddle point given by eq.(45) is a minimum. the action increases monoton-

ically when the period changes from (e = 0) to the sphaleron period s (see fig.4). the

curve sb() is convex downward and the thermal rate eq.(44) is, therefore, saturated either

by e = 0 or by e = u0 depending on temperature,

  esb(e=0),

u0
t ,

  e

t <

t >

sb(e = 0)

sb(e = 0)

fig.5 (fat line) shows the plot of ln  versus temperature t. the sharp rst order phase

transition is obvious, since the transition from quantum tunneling at zero energy jumps

directly to the thermal hopping. the periodic bounces with nite energy do not contribute

to the thermal nucleation rate except the zero energy bounce.

v. conclusions

the nucleation rate of the minisuperspace models is dominated either by quantum tunnel-

ing at low temperature or by thermal activation following the arrhenius law. the transition

of the creation rate from the quantum to the classical region is always a phase transition of

the sharp rst-order.
