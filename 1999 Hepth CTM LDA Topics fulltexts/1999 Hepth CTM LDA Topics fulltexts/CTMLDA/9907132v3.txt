abstract

the type iia/iib eective actions compactied on t d are known to be invariant under

the t-duality group so(d, d; z) although the invariance of the r-r sector is not so direct

to see. inspired by a work of brace, morariu and zumino, we introduce new potentials

which are mixture of r-r potentials and the ns-ns 2-form in order to make the invariant

structure of r-r sector more transparent. we give a simple proof that if these new

potentials transform as a majorana-weyl spinor of so(d, d; z), the eective actions are

indeed invariant under the t-duality group. the argument is made in such a way that

it can apply to kaluza-klein forms of arbitrary degree. we also demonstrate that these

new elds simplify all the expressions including the chern-simons term.

1 introduction

recent developments in string theory have been based on various kinds of duality sym-

metries. among them, the t-duality was found rst [1, 2], which changes the size of the

compactied space into its inverse in string unit. although this symmetry was rst recog-

nized in the spectra of perturbative strings, it came to be believed that this should hold as

an exact symmetry not simply as a perturbative one [3]. later, at the level of low energy

eective action, the t-duality invariance of the type iia/iib theory was identied with

a part of already known, much larger, and hidden symmetries of type ii supergravities

[4][7]. it was actually conjectured that the duality group of the full string theory can be

extended to the u-duality group ed+1(d+1)(z) when compactied on a d-dimensional torus

[8].

being a subgroup of the u-duality group, the t-duality group so(d, d; z) has a special

property:

it is the maximum subgroup which consists of the elements that transform

ns-ns and r-r elds into themselves, respectively. on the other hand, we sometimes

encounter situations where ns-ns and r-r elds are better treated in a separate way.

this is often the case when classical black-hole solutions of string theory are considered.

another example may be given by study of classical congurations based on the born-

infeld action. thus, it should be useful if one can know in a simple manner how ns-ns

and r-r elds transform under the t-duality group, without resorting to embedding the

whole structure once into the vast u-duality group.

the t-duality invariance can actually be seen very easily for the ns-ns sector of

supergravity action [9]. there the kinetic term of the kaluza-klein (kk) scalars (gij, bij)
(i, j = 1, ..., d) can be written as1

with a 2d  2d matrix

lns =

e2 tr(cid:16)m1m(cid:17)

m = (mrs) =   g1

(1.1)

(1.2)

1 this bij will be denoted by b(0)

in the following sections to notify that this is a scalar for the
noncompact (10  d)-dimensional space-time with coordinates x ( = 0, 1, ..., 9d). we will also take
the string unit  = 1.

and the (10d)-dimensional dilaton . thus the kinetic term is manifestly invariant under
t-duality transformations   o(d, d, z) if the dilaton does not change and m = (mrs)
(r, s = 1, .., 2d) transforms as

m = (cid:16)1(cid:17)t

 m  1.

(1.3)

the kk 1-forms (gi, bi) give a vector representation of o(d, d; z) and also have an

invariant kinetic term [9]. these facts will be reviewed later in more detail.

on the other hand, the invariance of the sector including r-r potentials under the

t-duality group so(d, d; z)2 is not so manifest as that for the ns-ns sector is. there

have actually been many works in which t-duality was studied as a subgroup of u-duality

group ed+1(d+1)(z) [10]. however, in order to write down the action in a manifestly u-

invariant form, one needs to make a non-trivial mapping from the original elds to some

other elds, which usually makes the t-duality symmetry for the original elds indirect.

as for the works based on the t-duality itself, results have been obtained [11] only for

nahm transformations which generate a subgroup of o(d, d; z).

by decomposing representations of ed+1(d+1)(z) with respect to so(d, d; z), it has

been also known that majorana-weyl representations of so(d, d; z) should appear in the

r-r sector (see, for example, [12]). however, as was discussed in detail for type iia

with d = 3 in [13, 14], the r-r potentials themselves do not give majorana-weyl spinors

directly. instead, one needs to combine them with the ns-ns 2-form to get new elds

that have such simple transformation properties under so(d, d; z). although prescription

on how to arrange these elds was known for each d by starting from 11-dimensional

supergravity [15], it is rather complicated due to the manner of eld redenitions which

strongly depends on the dimensionality. the main aim of this article is to present the

prescription of constructing the new elds and to demonstrate the t-duality invariance

of the r-r sector with the chern-simons term in a simple form. we give a discussion

by investigating solely the structure of the eective action of type iia/iib strings with

all fermionic elds set zero. inclusion of fermions with analysis of supersymmetry will

be discussed elsewhere. this work is inspired by analysis made by brace, morariu and

zumino [13, 14].

2 each of type iia and type iib is only invariant under the subgroup so(d, d; z) of o(d, d; z), as we

will see later.

the main result can be summarized as follows. first, we introduce new potentials
dp+1 = (1/(p+1)!)d1...p+1dx1     dxp+1 (1, ..., p+1 = 0, 1, ..., 9) which are mixtures
of r-r potentials and the ns-ns 2-form as

d0  c0,
d2  c2 + bb2  c0,
d4  c4 + 1

2 bb2  c2 + 1

2 bb2  bb2  c0,

d1  c1,
d3  c3 + bb2  c1,

(1.4)

where cp+1 is the original (p + 1)-form r-r potential and bb2 is the ns-ns 2-form in 10

dimensions. we further introduce potentials of higher degree, dp+1 (p + 1 = 5, ..., 8), as

their electromagnetic duals. more precisely, we introduce the sum of eld strengths

f  ebb2 

8xp+1=0

ddp+1 =

9xp+2=1

fp+2,

and require the following relations in their equations of motion:

f1 = f9,
f3 = f7,
f5 = f5,
f7 = f3,
f9 = f1.

f2 = f8,
f4 = f6,
f6 = f4,
f8 = f2,

(1.5)

(1.6)

note that 2 fn = (1)n+1fn in 10-dimensional minkowski space. the existence of these
elds, d5, ..., d8, is allowed by the equations of motion for d0, ..., d4.

our rst claim is that, as far as the equations of motion are concerned, the r-r action

with the chern-simons term can be rewritten into the following simple form:

s(iia)
r+cs 

s(iib)
r+cs 

1
82

82

10 z d10xqbg xp+2=2,4,6,8
10 z d10xqbg xp+2=1,3,5,7,9

fp+2  fp+2

fp+2  fp+2

(1.7)

with all the d0, ..., d8 being regarded as independent variables and with (1.6) being the

constraints to be imposed after the equations of motion are derived.

second, for d-dimensional toroidal compactication, we assemble the set of kk scalars

4

into the form (d) with 2d1 entries:

d = 1 :

(d) = (d1)

iia :

d = 2 :

(d) = (d1, d2)

d = 3 :

(d) = (d1, d2, d3, d123)

(1.8)

d = 4 :

(d) = (d1, d2, d3, d4, d123, d124, d134, d234)

...

...

d = 1 :

(d) = (d)

iib :

d = 2 :

(d) = (d, d12)

d = 3 :

(d) = (d, d12, d13, d23)

(1.9)

d = 4 :

(d) = (d, d12, d13, d14, d23, d24, d34, d1234)

...

...

where d = di1... ip+1 is the component of dp+1 in the compact directions yi1, ..., yip+1
(1  i1 <    < ip+1  d). similarly, we also assemble the set of kk 1-forms d i1...ip
( = 0, 1, ..., 9d):

d = 1 :

(d ) = (d)

iia :

d = 2 :

(d ) = (d, d 12)

d = 3 :

(d ) = (d, d 12, d 13, d 23)

(1.10)

d = 4 :

(d ) = (d, d 12, d 13, d 14, d 23, d 24, d 34, d 1234)

...

...

d = 1 :

(d ) = (d 1)

iib :

d = 2 :

(d ) = (d 1, d 2)

d = 3 :

(d ) = (d 1, d 2, d 3, d 123)

(1.11)

d = 4 :

(d ) = (d 1, d 2, d 3, d 4, d 123, d 124, d 134, d 234)

...

...

this assembling may continue to kk forms of higher degree when d is low enough.

our second claim is that the dimensionally-reduced action of the r-r sector with the

chern-simons term can be rewritten for type iia and iib, respectively, as3

lr+cs =

1
4

d s(m) d, +

1
16

[d] s(m) [d]

 +   

(1.12)

3 precise form is given by (4.25)(4.27).

5

where s(m) (,  = 1, ..., 2d1) is a representation matrix of m in the majorana-weyl
representation of so(d, d; r) with chirality . the invariance of the action thus now
becomes apparent by assuming that both of the d and d  transform as majorana-

weyl spinors:

d = s()d
d  = s()d .

(1.13)

we will prove the identity (1.12) for arbitrary d including kk forms of arbitrary degree.

we simplify the argument with the use of the fermionic oscillator construction of majorana

spinor representation given in [13, 14].

the present paper is organized as follows. in section 2, in order to x our convention,

we rst give a brief review on the invariance of the ns-ns sector and then introduce

new potentials dp+1. in section 3, we explicitly construct the spinor representations of

o(d, d; z) closely following [13, 14], and then rewrite the r-r action plus the chern-

simons term into a manifestly t-duality invariant form in section 4. section 5 is de-

voted to discussions. the existence of the elds d5, ..., d8 is proved in appendix, with a

demonstration that our new elds dp+1 greatly simplify all the expressions including the

chern-simons term.

2 type iia/iib eective actions

the action of ten-dimensional type iia/iib supergravity in the string metric can be split

into three parts [16]:

s = sns + sr + scs.

the rst term is the action for the ns-ns sector:

sns =

(2.1)

bg

bg(cid:19) ,
2 |ch3|2

10-dimensional metric, ns-ns 2-form and dilaton, respectively. the ns-ns eld strength

where x ( = 0, 1, ..., 9) are 10-dimensional coordinates, and bg, bb and b denote the
is written as ch3 = dbb2 with bb2 = (1/2)bbdx  dx. we adopt a rule that the subscript

6

of a form stands for its degree when it has a denite meaning in 10 dimensions. we also

often consider a sum of forms of various degree like  =pk k =pk(1/k!)1...k dx1
    dxk , and for this we introduce the invariant norm as

the action for the r-r sector, sr, can be written for iia and iib, respectively, as

(2.5)

(2.6)

we take a convention that ns-ns elds wear the hat (b) in 10 dimensions while r-r
elds do not. this is because ns-ns elds generally need to be redened after toroidal
compactication in order to nicely behave as elds living on the noncompact (10  d)-
dimensional space-time (see, for example, (2.7), (2.16), (2.17) and (2.20)).

after toroidal compactication on t d, there will appear various kk forms both from

the ns-ns and the r-r sectors. we rst review the ns-ns case, closely following [9].

ns-ns sector:

we parametrize the 10-dimensional metric as

dbs2  bgdxdx

= gdxdx + gij(dyi + ai

dx)(dyj + aj

dx).

(2.7)

7

here the 10-dimensional coordinates are decomposed as (x) = (x, yi) ( = 0, 1, ..., 9
d; i = 1, 2, ..., d), and we assume that all the elds depend only on the noncompact

coordinates x. with this parametrization, the kinetic term for potentials will take a

complicated form since the kk 1-form

a(1) i  ai

dx

(2.8)

will appear when contracting the indices in the compact directions. to simplify this, we

follow the prescription of [9] which we found can be restated as follows. first, given a

sum of forms  =pk k, we decompose it as

 =xq xn

1
n!

(q)
i1...in dyi1      dyin,

where the superscript (q) indicates that (q)

i1...in is a q-form for noncompact indices:

(q)

i1...in =

1
q!

1...q i1...indx1      dxq .

(2.9)

(2.10)

second, we introduce a new form  by replacing dyi in  with dyia(1) i, and reorganize
it as in (2.9):

  |dyi dyia(1) i
 (q)
i1...in dyi1      dyin.

1
n!

= xq xn

(2.11)

then the kinetic term can be expressed in such a way that all the indices are contracted

only with g and gij:

where we have dened

g,g

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)  (q)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

for example, the ns-ns eld strength ch3 is rewritten as

then the ns-ns part of the action will be rewritten [9] as

r-r sector with the chern-simons term:

the r-r potentials cp+1 = (1/(p+1)!) c1...p+1 dx1    dxp+1 also produce kk forms
of various degree after toroidal compactication. to simplify all the expressions, we rst

combine the r-r potentials with the ns-ns 2-form in 10 dimensions as follows4:

d0  c0,
d2  c2 + bb2  c0,
d4  c4 + 1

2 bb2  c2 + 1

2 bb2  bb2  c0.

d1  c1,
d3  c3 + bb2  c1,

the r-r eld strengths are then expressed with these dp+1 as

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

f2 = dd1,

f4 = dd3  bb2  dd1,

f1 = dd0,

f3 = dd2  bb2  dd0,
f5 = dd4  bb2  dd2 + 1

these can be written in a simple form

2 bb2  bb2  dd0.
f = ebb2  dd

if we introduce

d 

4xp+1=0

dp+1,

f 

5xp+2=1

fp+2.

4 for the type iia, the potentials d1 and d3 can be found in [14].

10

the equations of motion for d0, ..., d4 turn out to allow us to introduce extra r-r

potentials of higher degree, dp+1 (p + 1 = 5, ..., 8), that preserve the relation (2.26) with

d 

8xp+1=0

dp+1,

f 

9xp+2=1

fp+2,

if we introduce the following identication for the eld strengths of higher degree:

f1 = f9,
f3 = f7,
f5 = f5,
f7 = f3,
f9 = f1

f2 = f8,
f4 = f6,
f6 = f4,
f8 = f2,

(2.28)

(2.29)

(see appendix). interestingly, as far as the equations of motion are concerned, we can in

turn regard all the r-r potentials, d0, ..., d8, as independent variables and choose

as their action functional, with the understanding that the constraints (2.29) are imposed

after (and only after) the equations of motion are derived. in fact, one can prove that this

system gives the same equations of motion with those from the sum of r-r and chern-

simons terms sr + scs, (2.4)(2.6). we give a proof of this statement in appendix.

for d-dimensional toroidal compactication, we introduce the primed eld for f as

then the action for the r-r and chern-simons sector will be expressed as

f   f |dyi dyia(1) i .

g,g .

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

to show that lr+cs is invariant under o(d, d; z) when the set of kk elds coming
from d transforms as a majorana spinor of o(d, d; z), in the next section we explicitly

11

construct the spinor representation of o(d, d; r) by using fermionic operators. we mostly

follow the convention of [13, 14].

before concluding this section, we would like to make a comment on the potentials

d1 and d3 in the type iia case. it is well known that the type iia supergravity can be

obtained from the 11-dimensional supergravity [5] by dimensional reduction. a coordinate
transformation along the 11-th direction x10  x10 +  becomes a u(1) symmetry in 10-
dimensions:

bb2 = 0,

c1 = d,

c3 = bb2  d.

(2.34)

thus, these d elds diagonalize the u(1) symmetry : d1  d1 + d, d3  d3. these
are 10-dimensional analogues of a elds of [6].

3 spinor representation of o(d, d; r)

we rst recall that the group o(d, d; r) consists of 2d  2d matrices  satisfying

t j  = j,

j =  0

1d

1d

0 ! .

the group o(d, d; z) is dened as a subgroup that consists of matrices with integer-valued

elements. it is known that both are generated by the following three types of matrices

[17]:

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

bt = b,

0

b =   1 b
1 ! ,
r =   r1
rt! ,
i =   1  ei ei
1  ei! ,

ei

0

0

r  gl(d; r) or gl(d; z),

(ei)jk = ijik,

(i = 1, ..., d).

(3.4)

note that det b = det r = +1 and det i = 1. thus one can construct a subgroup
so(d, d; r) or so(d, d; z) as such that are generated by b, r and ij.

the dirac matrices r = (r ) with 2d  2d components are introduced as

{r, s} = 2jrs

(r, s = 1, ..., 2d),

(3.5)

12

and the spinor representation s() = (s()) is characterized by the property

s()  s  s()1 =xr

r r

s.

(3.6)

to construct this representation, we introduce fermionic operators i and i with the
anti-commutation relations

{i, j} = i

j 1,

{i, j} = 0 = {i, j}

(i, j = 1, ..., d).

(3.7)

we dene the hermitian conjugation as

(i) = i,

(3.8)

and introduce the vacuum | 0 i such that i | 0 i = 0 (i = 1, ..., d) and h 0 | 0 i = 1. then
the 2d-dimensional fermion fock space is spanned by the vectors

| i = i1    in | 0 i

(n = 0, ..., d),

(3.9)

where  is a multi-index  = (i1, ..., in) (i1 <   < in), and the dirac matrices can be
introduced with respect to this as follows:

thus, if we can always introduce an operator  to any element

1
2

(i)

(d+i) .

i |  i = x |  i
i |  i = x |  i
 =  (ai

j)!  o(d, d; r)

such that

( j1, j1 ) = ( iai

j + icij, ibij + idi

= ( i, i )  a b
d! ,

c

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

j )

then, introducing the matrix s() by |  i = p | i s(), we can establish the

relation (3.6). for this, it is enough to construct the operators that correspond to the

elements given in (3.2)(3.4), and it is easy to show that the followings are solutions

[13, 14]:

b = eb  exp(cid:18)
r = (det r)1/2 exp(cid:16)iai

bijij(cid:19) ,
jj(cid:17)

1
2

i = i + i

(i = 1, ..., d).

13

(cid:16)r =(cid:16)ri

j(cid:17) = exp(cid:16)ai

j(cid:17)(cid:17) ,

(3.13)

notice that all of these operators give real-valued matrix elements, so that the resulting

representation is automatically majorana. note also that the is do not give a faithful

representation so that there are always ambiguities in their orderings.

in order to construct weyl representations, we dene a matrix

2d+1 

1
2d

dyi=1

(i + d+i)(i  d+i)

(3.14)

which satises {2d+1, r} = 0 (r = 1, ..., 2d). by looking at the correspondence (3.10),
one can easily see that 2d+1 corresponds to (1)nf with nf = pi ii. thus, the
projection to the subspace with (1)nf = 1 leads to a majorana-weyl representation
(cid:16)2d1(cid:17)s
. note that i is a linear function

and the other one with (1)nf = 1 to(cid:16)2d1(cid:17)c

of fermions and thus changes the chirality. therefore, in order for an operator to preserve

the chirality it must correspond to an element in so(d, d; r).

we further introduce an operator j that corresponds to j = (jrs):

j = id(d1)/2 1    d,

where the phase factor is chosen such that j2 = 1. one can actually prove that

j i j = i,

j i j = i.

(3.15)

(3.16)

it is easy to check that for all these s in (3.13) (and thus for all elements in o(d, d; r)),
their transposes t = j  1  j are mapped to :
 = j1j.

(3.17)

in particular, we have

b = eb

= exp(cid:18)1

2

bij ij(cid:19) ,

t

0

b =  1

b 1! .

(3.18)

note also that the normalization of the operators (3.13) is correctly chosen such that they

satisfy the condition (3.17).

we nally make a comment that this operator j is essentially the charge conjugation

operator. in fact, the operators dened by

c  1    d

14

(3.19)

with

i  i  i

can be easily seen to satisfy

c (cid:16)c(cid:17) = 1,
=  (1)d i,

c i (cid:16)c(cid:17)1

= (1)d(d1)/2 1,

(cid:16)c(cid:17) 2
c i (cid:16)c(cid:17)1

=  (1)d i.

(3.20)

(3.21)

this implies that the matrices c = (c) dened by c |  i = |  i c satisfy the
condition for the charge conjugation of so(d, d) [18]:

c (cid:16)c(cid:17) = 1,
c r (cid:16)c(cid:17)1

(cid:16)c(cid:17) t

=  (1)d (r)t .

= (1)d(d1)/2 c,

(3.22)

4 r-r potentials and t-duality

in this section, we show that the r-r action plus the chern-simons term after toroidal

compactication on t d, (2.32)(2.33), is actually invariant under so(d, d; z) if a set of

our r-r elds transform as a majorana-weyl spinor.

we rst introduce a one-to-one correspondence between the set of forms and the space

of creation operators by replacing the dierential in the compact direction dyi with the
fermion creation operator i  as5

 =xn

i1...indyi1      dyin =xq xn

to

1
n!

i1...ini1    in =xq xn

n!

(q)
i1...ini1    in.

(4.2)

this actually gives an isomorphism as algebra. we also extend our rule such that (q)

i1...in
has nf = q, and thus it will anticommute with all the fermionic operators when q is odd.

we dene a state corresponding to  as

5 recall that the superscript (q) indicates that (q)

i1...in

is a q-form for noncompact indices (see (2.10)).

| i  | 0 i .

(4.3)

15

note that the following holds for any two forms  and :

| i = |   i .

(4.4)

now that we have the above isomorphism, we can introduce the operator corresponding

to f in (2.26):

f = ebb2 dd.

(4.5)

since fp+2 are even (odd) forms for type iia (iib), we have (1)nf | f i = + | f i for type
iia and = | f i for type iib. this implies that each state has a denite chirality and
thus forms a majorana-weyl representation of so(d, d; z). noticing that the replacement
dyi  dyia(1) i as in (2.31) is equivalent to the operation

i  eia(1) i

ieia(1) i

= ia(1) i,

we can simply express the operator corresponding to f  as

f = eia(1) i

feia(1) i

,

and thus the corresponding state can be written as

(4.6)

(4.7)

| f  i = f | 0 i = eia(1) i

f| 0 i

= eia(1) i

ebb2 | dd i = eia(1) i

ebb2eia(1) i

 eia(1) i

| dd i .

(4.8)

here one can use (2.17) to show that

eia(1) ibb2eia(1) i

therefore we have

m = eb(0) 

g eb(0)

with

g eihi

j j

g 

(cid:18)(gij) = e(hi

j)(cid:19) .

this operator g has a special property. in fact, suppose that for a given state

| i =xq xn

n!

(q)
i1...in i1    in | 0 i ,

we introduce its hermitian conjugate as

h | =xq xn

n! h 0 | in    i1 10d (q)

i1...in,

where 10d is the hodge-star in the noncompact (10 d) dimensions. then the following
identity holds:

d10dxg g | |2

g,g = h | g | i .

(4.19)

17

in fact, using

g | i = xq xn
= xq xn

we can show

setting  = f  in (4.19), we have

d10dxg g | f  |2

g,g = h f  | g | f  i .

since this f  is written as in (4.10), the r-r action with the chern-simons term is

(4.21)

(4.22)

(2)

b

(4.28)

we see that the action is invariant under the whole t-duality group so(d, d; z) if the

d = (d) transforms as a majorana-weyl spinor:

furthermore, if we expand d with respect to noncompact indices as

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) de = | d i .

d =xq

q!

dx1    dxq d1...q

with

then each coecient d1...q will also transform as a majorana spinor:6

or equivalently,

d1...q  =x

(4.30)

(4.31)

(4.32)

(4.33)

with multi-indices  = (i1, ..., in) (i1 <   < in; n = 0, ..., d). since d1...q i1...in vanishes
if q + n = even (odd) for type iia (iib), it has a denite chirality. this implies that

d1...q = (d1...q ) transforms as a majorana-weyl spinor for each set of noncompact

indices (1, ..., q).

5 discussion

in the present article, we have given a simple proof that if the r-r potentials cp+1 are

combined with the ns-ns 2-form as in (2.24), then their kk forms transform as majorana-

weyl spinors under the t-duality group so(d, d; z) in order to make the action invariant.

6 to be more precise, the following discussion holds only when q + d  10.

19

there should be various applications once transformation rules are obtained explicitly

for the whole t-duality group. one will be to establish relations among various classical

solutions of type iia/iib supergravities by using the full t-duality group together with

the s-duality of type iib. the work in this direction is in progress and will be reported

elsewhere [19].

we nally make a comment on the dilaton dependence in r-r potentials, assuming

cp+1 and our potential dp+1. usually we expect that another eld strength dened

the case bb2 = 0 in which there is no distinction between the original r-r potential
by efp+2 = eb dcp+1 corresponds to an r-r vertex operator of nsr strings in a at
background. to see this in our formulation, we rst recall that we have introduced
the (10  d)-dimensional dilaton  as a singlet of o(d, d; z). this implies that the 10-
dimensional dilaton b should transform as eb  g1/4. on the other hand, we could have
further decomposed the operator g as g = ee where e = (eia) (i, a = 1, ..., d) is
a vielbein for g, g = e et . then one might say that the state e | dc i corresponds to
an r-r vertex in a at background. thus, noticing that the operator e will carry the
factor g1/4, we expect that eb dc will transform as in a at case.
