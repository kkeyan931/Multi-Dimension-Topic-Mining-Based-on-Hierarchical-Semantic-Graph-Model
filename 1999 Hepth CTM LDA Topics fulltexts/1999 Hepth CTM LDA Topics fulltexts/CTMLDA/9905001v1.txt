regularization of quantum eld theories introduces a mass scale which breaks axial rotational and
scaling invariances. we demonstrate from rst principles that axial torsion and torsion trace modes
have non-tranverse vacuum polarization tensors, and become massive as a result of the adler-bell-
jackiw (abj) and scaling anomalies. since these are the only torsion components that can couple
minimally to spin 1
2 particles, the anomalous generation of masses for these modes, naturally of the
order of the regulator scale, may help to explain why torsion and its associated eects, including
cpt violation in chiral gravity, have so far escaped detection. as a simpler manifestation of the
abj anomaly than triangle diagrams, the vacuum polarization demonstration is also pedagogically
useful.

i. introduction and overview

torsion arises naturally in riemann-cartan spacetimes when the vierbein, ea, and spin connection, aab, are
assumed to be independent.1 there is no compelling physical reason which forces torsion to vanish identically.
however not all components of torsion interact naturally with matter. in minimal coupling schemes only spinors
couple to torsion, and even then only the axial and trace modes of torsion couple to spin 1
2 particles. actually, in a
hermitian theory, only the axial torsion mode, a, interacts minimally with spin 1
2 matter.

investigations have nevertheless uncovered that torsion can have quite interesting quantum eld theoretic eects.
recent works have revealed that even the well-studied adler-bell-jackiw (abj) anomaly [1] receives further contri-
butions from torsional invariants [24]. moreover, because of the axial vector torsion coupling, the abj anomaly is
already manifest at the level of vacuum polarization diagrams [4], even in four dimensions, in the form of the nieh-yan
term [5]. this is novel since the usual quadratic in curvature abj anomaly terms come from triangle diagrams. indeed
the vacuum polarization diagram with two external axial torsion vertices nicely illustrates the underlying reason of
the abj anomaly in the conict between classical axial rotational invariance and the need for symmetry breaking
regularization of divergent diagrams. as a simpler manifestation of the abj anomaly than triangle diagrams, this
vacuum polarization illustration of the anomaly is also pedagogically useful.

conversely, quantum eld theoretic requirements can impact on certain torsion modes. a striking illustration is
the generation of masses for these modes from anomalies. the nieh-yan contribution to the abj anomaly,  a,
suggests that if the analogy of the axial torsion photon [4] is pursued further, then the photon should become
massive because of the anomaly since gauge invariance (to be precise, 5 rotational symmetry) is anomalously
broken by regularization, and the conservation of the associated current fails at the vacuum polarization level. we
shall demonstrate from rst principles that this is indeed true. it shall be shown that the vacuum polarization tensors
for both the axial torsion and torsion trace photons are not tranverse and there are longitudinal modes. the extra
term proportional to g in the polarization tensors implies that these torsion modes become massive as a result of
the abj and scaling anomalies.

it should be emphasized that the theories we shall be considering are not internally inconsistent, because these 5
and scaling transformations are not gauged as local symmetries. we shall employ an explicitly gauge, lorentz and
dieomorphism invariant generalized pauli-villars regularization scheme [6,7]. it therefore follows, and it shall also

be proven in appendix b, that normal vacuum polarization tensors of internal gauge elds are still tranverse and the
usual internal gauge elds, wa, remain massless.

a)j 

in a truly weyl theory, both the torsion trace and axial torsion components interact equally with chiral left-handed
fermions [8]. to be precise, appendix a shows that the coupling is (ib + 1
l. the ib piece is anti-hermitian,
4e
so hermitizing the action eliminates it altogether. however the b interaction is allowed if left-handed weyl fermions
interact with only the anti-self-dual or left-handed part of the spin connection. actually, this is required by the anti-
self-dual description of chiral gravity [9] which extends the weyl nature of the standard model to the gravitational
sector [8,10]. if the holomorphic dependence on the chiral or (left-handed) spin connection is maintained even by the
regularization scheme (and this is true of the pauli-villars scheme which will be used here [6]), then the generation of
a by the abj anomaly must entail that b should also be massive. otherwise the chirality of the theory
mass for 1
4e
would be anomalously violated at the quantum eld theoretic level. that b becomes massive is not self-evident since
it has a vector, rather than axial vector, coupling to the fermion current, and one may expect its vacuum polarization
tensor to be no dierent from the corresponding quantity in quantum electrodynamics. the dierence lies in the
anti-hermitian coupling. in the regularization, the positive denite euclidean operator is id/ (id/ ) and (id/ ) diers
from id/ , whereas usual internal gauge elds lead to hermitian dirac operators. we detail in section ii how this causes
the vacuum polarization tensor for b to be dierent from the usual result for gauge theories and how b acquires
an anomalously generated mass. let us however rst briey review for a bispinor theory why the axial torsion mode
is massive because of the abj anomaly.

a. vacuum polarization and the abj anomaly

had this expression been well dened, it would have been no more than

 (k)  z d4p t r{

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

since the two 5s cancel out in the trace, and we would have obtained the usual vacuum polarization amplitude for
which we do not expect a longitudinal component. alas it is not, for the integration over fermion loop momentum
diverges. regularization (using for instance pauli-villars regulators with masses {mn}) introduces a subtlety which is
the very basis of the abj anomaly. summing over the propagators for all the elds, including the massive regulators,
results in

 (k)  xn

cnz d4p t r{5

1

(p/ + k/ )  mn

5

1

p/  mn},

(1.6)

with cn = 1, depending on whether the regulators are anticommuting or commuting. (for the original fermion
multiplet, c0 = 1 and m0 = 0.) by moving the second 5 to the left to cancel out the rst, and bearing in mind that

2

5 anticommutes with the dirac matrices, we observe that mn changes its relative sign with respect the (p/ + k/ ) in
the denominator. consequently,

 (k)  xn

cnz d4p t r{

(p/ + k/ ) + mn



1

p/  mn}.

(1.7)

the integrals over the loop momentum will be well dened for a suitable set {cn, mn}. the important point is that
if we had started with a vector (instead of the axial vector) coupling, the result for eq. (1.7) would have been

instead. rewriting

 (k)  xn

cnz d4p t r{

(p/ + k/ )  mn

=

1

(p/ + k/ )  mn 

2mn

(p + k)2  m2

n

.

(1.8)

(1.9)

and substituting this back into eq. (1.7) gives the rst contribution precisely as in eq. (1.8), but there is now an
additional anomalous term which is

xn

cnz d4p t r{

2mn

(p + k)2  m2

(1.10)

this non-tranverse part of the vacuum polarization tensor, above and beyond the usual tranverse (kk  gk2)(k2)
term from eq. (1.8), is clearly generated anomalously through massive regulators which break the 5 symmetry of
the classical action. both the axial vector coupling and the presence of nontrvial mns from the regularization are
required for the argument to go through. from

and the divergence of eq. (1.3), we deduce that

 = (kk  g k2) + g

k  k

and hj 5ireg.   a 6= 0

(1.11)

(1.12)

at the level of vacuum polarization diagrams. the anomalous g contribution in the vacuum polarization tensor
also implies that besides the usual f f  piece required for the tranverse polarization a mass counter term of the
form aa is also needed for the anomalous component in the eective action. a becomes massive as a result.

we perform the explicit computation of the vacuum polarization tensor for internal gauge elds using a pauli-villars
regularization which explicitly respects the chirality of the theory in appendix b. the intermediate steps are shown
in detail for a number of reasons. first, this invariant regularization diers from conventional schemes in utilizing
an innite tower of massive pauli-villars regulators. this is necessary for weyl fermions when the gauge coupling
representation t a is complex, as it is in the standard model. second, the doubling is also done in internal t a gauge
space rather than in the external left-right lorentz space. this dierence is not really signicant for the vacuum
polarization of internal gauge elds in at spacetime, but for gravitational elds doubling in the internal space allows
us to avoid the introduction of right-handed fermions and right-handed spin conncetions and thereby preserve the
chirality of the gravitational interaction even at the level of regularization. thus even in teleparallel spacetimes with
a will be ensured at the quantum
at vierbien, the chirality of the torsion coupling of weyl fermions to c = ib + 1
4e
eld theoretic level. finally, the explicit intermediate steps allow us to compare and contrast with the results of the
polarization of the torsion modes in section ii. further remarks on the distinction between gauged and ungauged
symmetries, lorentz invariance and abelian couplings, and also cpt violation in chiral gravity are presented in
section iii.

ii. weyl fermions and vacuum polarization tensor of torsion fields

the classical weyl action for a left-handed fermion multiplet is

sl = z d4x elid/ l,

(2.1)

2 aabab + wat a).

with id/ = (i + i
it is known that if the representation of the internal gauge eld t a
is anomaly-free (t r(t a) = t r(t a{t b, t c}) = 0), then all fermionic loops in background gauge and gravitational
elds of the theory can be regularized in an explicitly gauge, lorentz and dieomorphism invariant manner through
an innite tower of pauli-villars regulators which are doubled in the internal space (please see ref. [6] for further
details). specically, to form invariant masses, the internal space is doubled from t a to

t a = (cid:18) (t a)
and the original fermion multiplet is projected as l = 1
3 = (cid:18) 1d

0

t a(cid:19) ;

2 (1  3)l, where
0 1d(cid:19) ,

and d is the number of weyl fermions in the l multiplet. written in full, the regularized action is

(2.2)

(2.4)

the sums are over all even natural numbers for the anticommuting and over all odd natural numbers for the commuting
elds. with the exception of the original undoubled and massless (m0 = 0) multiplet (written as l0  l), all
other anticommuting lr and commuting ls multiplets are generalized pauli-villars regulator elds, doubled in
internal space, and endowed with majorana masses, which we take for deniteness to satisfy mn = n. c4 is the
charge conjugation matrix in four dimensions, and in the covariant derivative all elds are now coupled to wat a. we
emphasize that because all the multiplets are left-handed, there are no couplings to the right-handed spin connection
which neither needs nor and should be introduced for a truly weyl theory. the regularization therefore preserves
the chirality of the theory with respect to the gravitational interaction. we shall assume analytic continuation to
2 (1  3)
euclidean greens functions.

note that b comes with an i in the complex combination c because, unlike 5 rotations, the group parametrized

symmetries, and the current j 
l coupled to c is not conserved. as shown, k  k at the vacuum polarization
level. the full weyl theory exhibits no inconsistencies because these invariances are really not gauged as local
symmetries. the theory is on the other hand dieomorphism, and local internal gauge and lorentz invariant, with
internal symmetries gauged by wa and local lorentz invariance by the full spin connection aab.
in fact, c
transforms as a general coordinate vector and is lorentz and gauge invariant. under global 5 transformations, ea

6

and aab are inert; while ea  exp()ea but aab remains unchanged under global scaling. hence c is invariant
under both. these global transformations are however symmetries of the bare weyl action. as a result j 
l = 0 and
the vanishing of the trace of the energy momentum tensor et 
 hold at the classical level, but these equations are
nevertheless anomalous at the quantum level. for the weyl theory, there is actually an interesting relation

connecting the abj and conformal anomalies [8].

the fact that the current coupled to c is anomalous does not mean that lorentz invariance has been sacriced.
although the torsion coupling is similar to an abelian interaction there are no lorentz anomalies in four dimensions
[11], even in the presence of torsion [12]. this is compatible with the fact that the regularization of ref. [6] employed
here explicitly maintains all the gauged symmetries, including local lorentz invariance. what is true is that lorentz
symmetry cannot be preserved at the quantum level if we also insist on simultaneously maintaining the abelian gauge
symmetry. we may however keep lorentz invariance but tolerate anomalies in currents not coupled to gauge elds.
this is precisely the case here for lorentz invariance is explicit, while abelian 5 rotations and scaling symmetry
are anomalously broken by the massive regulators and are not gauged as local symmetries. with regard to gauged
abelian internal symmetries, we still require t r(t a) to vanish for the regularization to work in curved space [6].

the combination c is complex, and the counterterms of the lorentzian signature lagrangian required by the

vacuum polarization diagrams are of the form

egg(c  c)(c  c) = egg[(b  b)(b  b)
+2i(b  b)(a  a)

+(a   a)(a  a)],

and

egcc = eg(bb + 2iba + aa).

(3.5)

(3.6)

therefore the anti-hermitian cross terms are lorentz invariant, but cpt-odd. in a related work [8] it was pointed
out that a truly weyl theory which preserves the chirality of the gravitational interaction should violate cpt through
b eects because of the non-hermitian coupling; and that these signatures of chiral gravity [9] will already be
manifest at the level of quantum eld theory in curved spaces in weyl fermion loops processes with external chiral
gravitational elds. an example is precisely the vacuum polarization diagram with two complex left-handed spin
connection vertices. the at vierbein limit with nontrivial c evaluated here indeed conrms the presence of these
cpt-violating terms in the eective action.

the question of mass generation via anomalies has had a storied past. in the schwinger model, the physical degree
of freedom of the photon is equivalent to a free massive boson [13,14] since the interaction term can be transformed
away by an axial rotation. the mass of the boson stems from the abj anomaly, and is uniquely determined when
the vacuum polarization tensor is regularized to satisfy vector gauge invariance at the expense of axial vector current
conservation. on the other hand, the chiral schwinger model is anomalous albeit exactly solvable. the resultant
photon mass carries an ambiguity as the previous condition of gauge invariance is now absent. it can be made to
vanish, while preserving the (v-a) form for the coupling, but we lose unitarity [15]. for the relevant polarization
tensor in four dimensions, we explicitly retain all local gauge symmetries and the holomorphic dependence on the
left-handed spin connection in the regularization. the resultant vacuum polarization is by contrast non-tranverse,
and gives a mass to c = ib + a. these torsion modes are massive because of abj and scaling anomalies, with
generated masses of the order of the regulator scale. since these are the only modes that can couple to spin 1
2 fermions,
large regulator masses, or high cut-o scales in the context of eective eld theories, naturally explain why torsion
and its associated eects, including cpt violations from b couplings, have so far escaped detection.

for pure internal gauge elds in at spacetime we set a = b = 0 in the dirac operator to yield

the positive-denite operator which appears in the regulator function is

id/ = (id/ ) = i/ + w/ at a.

id/ (id/ ) =  + i/ w/ at a + w/ at ai/ + w/ at aw/ bt b

in the above, we display only terms which will contribute to the vacuum polarization tensor i.e. terms which are
linear in wa since the vacuum polarization ab is dened through the fourier transform

with cn = (1)n and mn = n. for the explicit computation of the polarization tensor, a few identities related to
our regulator function f (p2) are required. we have

and

by writing ab as a sum of tranverse and non-tranverse parts,

we observe that the non-tranverse contribution vanishes identically since

after integration over z. this agrees with result obtained previously in refs. [7] and [16] using the generalized pauli-
villars scheme with doubling in external left-right fermionic space (rather than the method here of doubling in the
internal t a space).

the vacuum polarization tensor for internal gauge elds is therefore still transverse, and internal gauge elds remain
massless. this is expected since the regularization explicitly respects the local internal symmetries gauged by wa.
