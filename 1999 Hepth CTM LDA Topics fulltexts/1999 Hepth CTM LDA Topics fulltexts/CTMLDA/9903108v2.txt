abstract

in this paper we investigate about several congurations of two intersecting
branes at arbitrary angles. we choose the viewpoint of a brane source and a brane
probe and use the low-energy dynamics of p-branes. for each p-brane this dynamics
is governed by a generic dbi action including a wz term, which couples to the
sugra background of the other brane. the analysis naturally reveals two types of
congurations: the marginal and the non-marginal ones. we specify possible
congurations for a pair of similar or non-similar branes in either of these two
categories.
in particular, for two similar branes at angles, this analysis reveals
that all the marginal congurations are specied by su (2) angles while the non-
marginal congurations are specied by sp(2) angles. on the other hand, we nd
that no other conguration of two intersecting branes at non-trivial angles can be
constructed out of at p-branes. so in particular, two non-similar branes can only
be found in an orthogonal conguration. in this case the intersection rules for either
of the marginal or non-marginal congurations are derived, which thereby provide
interpretations for the known results from supergravity.

1 introduction

intersecting branes at arbitrary angles have been studied both in view of their susy
properties in supergravity [3, 2, 1, 4, 5] and their short-range interactions in string and
m(atrix) theory [4, 5, 6]. despite the variety of the information on susy properties of
branes at angles, less has been known about the structure of the supergravity solutions
that describe this type of congurations. the well known examples of these solutions
include the 2-angle (marginal) conguration of two d2-branes at su(2) angles [7], and
the 4-angle (non-marginal) conguration of two ns5-branes at sp(2) angles [8] and their
generalizations to n such branes [7, 8, 10, 11] (for some other works in this respect see
also [9, 12, 13]). the solution for the (marginal) conguration at su(2) angles of two
arbitrary similar branes has been recently found in [14]. nevertheless, there has been no
solutions that describe, for example, marginal intersections of similar branes at three or
more angles, or those for the non-similar branes at other than the right angles. a system-
atic approach to the solution of this problem can be found in the works of [14, 15], where
such solutions for a distributed system of branes at angles are considered. the analysis of
these solutions, in the light of a general formulation in [15], reveals that, as far as we deal
with at p-branes, such solutions can not be realized in terms of the harmonic functions.
that is, in general, one can not nd congurations of branes at angles constructed from
parallel distributions of at p-branes. the physics underlying this property can be better
understood, if one takes into account the role of the brane(s) interactions and dynamics
in forming a conguration at several angles. in fact, determining the stability conditions
for any conguration of p-branes, based on the worldvolume dynamics of the branes, is
logically prior to any eort for nding a supergravity background that describes the con-
guration. the interactions of d-branes at angles have been studied by calculating the
amplitudes in the scattering processes, both in string and m(atrix) theory, which deter-
mine the static potentials between pairs of these objects [5, 6]. that such a potential
identically vanishes determines the necessary condition for the stability of the congura-
tion. one of the basic ingredients in such calculations, which makes them at all possible,
is the assumption of atness for the worldvolume geometries of the individual branes as
well as their spacetime background. however, there may exist congurations for which
the the two branes are not at and so all features of their motion can not be described
by a single potential. for example, they may tend to rotate relative to each other due to
the twisting forces (or the relative torques) between themselves. so one has to add the
conditions that guaranty the balancing of such forces as well. in fact, the full set of the
stability conditions for a conguration of two interacting branes are those that satisfy the
equations of motion for both of the branes when they are in at states. doing this, in
general, involves extra complexities because of the need for determining the supergravity

1

background for an arbitrarily curved p-brane. for at bps branes, however, this problem
is considerably simplied by the fact that a bps brane in this state does not suer from
self-interaction forces. indeed, in such a case the forces on each individual brane, due to
coupling to its own supergravity background, are balanced against each other and hence,
it can be studied as a probe scattered from another brane, which is the source of a well
known supergravity background [18]. the aim of this paper is to study and classify pos-
sible congurations of branes at angles, assuming the dbi+wz worldvolume action as
the branes dynamics. to this end, we rst determine the general necessary and sucient
conditions that specify a stable conguration of two arbitrary at branes in section 2.
then, in sections 3,4,5, we use these general conditions for categorizing several congu-
rations of two branes at angles for the cases of similar, non-similar and electromagnetic
dual branes. we will consider both the marginal and non-marginal bound states in these
sections. multi-angle marginal intersections are discussed in section 5, and at the end, we
derive physical interpretations for our stability conditions in section 7. we end the paper
by a summary and some remarks.

2 general set up for the stability conditions

as the discussion in the introduction implies, in all cases with at worldvolume geometries,
one can describe a two brane system, equivalently, by the worldvolume action for each of
its constituent branes. for simplicity, we assume that d1  d2 and we take the (d1  1)-
brane as a probe moving in the background elds produced by a (d2 1)-brane source. to
describe this conguration, we shall use an orthogonal coordinate system whose axes are
dened using the tangent and normal directions of the two branes as indicared in table
(1). in this table d := d1 + d2   stands for the dimension of the hyperplane spanned
by the world directions of the two branes, and d denotes the spacetime dimension. the
situation is schematically displayed in gure (1).

table (1): decomposition of the spacetime coordinates

we choose x := (x, xr) as the parameterizing coordinates of the probe and ya :=
(yi, yr, za) as its embedding coordinates. according to the count of coordinates in table

yr

figure 1: representation of the branes worldvolumes and the spacetime coordinates (note
that coordinates x and za can not be displayed in this gure)

(1), there are cases for which some of the coordinates in our decompoition are not present.
for example, when d1 = d2, we have no yi coordinates. similarly, when d1 =  (i.e., the
two branes are parallel), there are no xr and yr coordinates. however, this has no eect
on our general equations as they are formulated in terms of the coordinates x and ya
regardless their numbers.

thus, the embedding coordinates for a probe rotated/boosted relative to a xed source

are represented as

y a(x) = a

 x + ya

with s and y0s representing constant slopes/velocities and shifts. it is clear from the
denitions in table (1) that

a

(2)

that is, (y i, z a) are constants and none of y as depend on (x). evidently, the remaining
s can not have arbitrary values. in fact, they have to be chosen in a way that eq.(1)
solves the (d1  1)-brane equations of motion:

where h represents a harmonic function in the (yr, za)-directions [16]. taking this into
account, and that y rs are independent coordinates as far as xrs are so, one can see that
eq.(4) leads to

z a = 0

(7)

we will refer to eqs.(6),(7) as the no-force and no-torque conditions, respectively, since
they are indeed the conditions for the vanishing of the oscillations along the transverse di-
rections of the two branes, as well as their (relative) rotations along the relative transverse
directions (see section 7).

2.1 the marginal and non-marginal congurations

by denition, a marginal conguration of two branes is the one which is stable at any ar-
bitrary separations of the two branes, i.e., for any constant values of z as. this, according
to eq.(6), implies

l(h; )  l0()

(8)

showing that the total potential energy between the two branes has a constant value. it is
obvious that eq.(7) in this case is automatic and hence the above equation is the unique
description of the marginal congurations.

there exist other congurations, however, that can be formed only at zero separations
of the two participating branes, i.e., when the centers of the two branes in their transverse
space are coincident and they actually intersect each other. we refer to these as the non-
marginal congurations [17]. for such solutions, with z a = 0, eq.(6) is automatic and
hence eq.(7) or its equivalent as

r


l
  r
s

sl  cr

s ()

(9)

provides a unique description for the non-marginal congurations. in the following three
sections, we analyze the eqs.(8),(9) for classifying several marginal and non-marginal
congurations that may occur in cases with a pair of similar (d1 = d2), non-similar
(d1 6= d2) and electromagnetic dual (d1 = d2) branes. the notations will be mainly
identical to those introduced in [14, 16].

4

3 congurations with similar branes

using the general expression of the lagrangian for a (d  1)-probe in a (d  1)-source
background [16], the function l(h; ) is found to be

l = h 1[det1/2(1 + h)  1]

where the angular information is encoded in the matrix  having the components



 := rr


(10)

(11)

and the indices of the type of  are raised and lowered by  := diag(1, +1,  , +1).
the matrix  can be diagonalized by choosing the coordinates (xr, yr) so that the two
branes to be related by a set of commuting rotations and a boost. in such coordinates,
 has the components


 = diag(v2, tan21,  , tan2d1) =: 

 

(12)

here, v represents the magnitude of the velocity vector in the directions transverse to the
(d  1)-source and s are the angles of the (d  1) commuting rotations (obviously, a
number  of these angles are vanishing by assumption).

3.1 marginal intersections

inserting the expression (10) for l into the marginality condition, eq.(8), one obtains

det(1 + h)  (1 + l0h)2

(h > 0)

in the basis that  has the form of eq.(12), this identity reads

(1  v2h)(1 + tan21h)    (1 + tan2d1h)  (1 + l0h)2

thus the only possibility for the rotation and boost parameters is

1 = 2 =: 
v = 3 =    = d1 = 0

(13)

(14)

(15)

that is:
the only marginal conguration of two similar branes are the static congurations with
two non-vanishing angles obtained by an abelian subgroup of the su(2) rotations.
this is the same as the 1/4 susy conguration whose supergravity solution had been
found earlier in [14] as a generalization to the solution of 2-branes at angles [7]. the

5

constant value of l in this case is l0 = tan2.
another possibility, which one might consider for two similar branes, was the brane-anti-
brane system. in this case the constant term (1) in brackets in eq.(10) would be ipped
to (+1) which is equivalent to ipping l0 to l0 in eq.(13) or (14). however, because
l0  1 in this case, eq.(14) could not be satised for any real values of v and s. in other
words, a brane-anti-brane pair with any combination of a boost and several rotations is
unstable and can not form a marginal conguration.

3.2 non-marginal congurations

it is easy to see that the non-marginality condition, eq.(9), after some algebra reduces
to

(1)r

(16)
where  := 1 + h ,  := det and (crs) are a set of angle-dependent constants. in
the basis that makes  diagonal (eq.(12)), the above equation is also diagonal and after
some manipulations yields

  rsh 1(  1) = crs
s

(1 + h)  (1 + hr)2(1 + hcr)2
y

(h > 0)

where crs =: rscr. for this equation to be satised identically, one needs

1 = 3 , 2 = 4
v = 5 =    = d1 = 0

(17)

(18)

that is:
the only non-marginal congurations of two similar branes are the static congurations
with four angles obtained by two independent abelian subgroup of the su(2) rotations.

it is easy to check that, unless one of the (1, 2) vanishes, in this case l is not
a constant, but it is a linear function of h. orthogonal congurations of the 4-angle
intersections have been found previously in the literature of the supergravity composite
brane solutions [21]. the most famous examples in this category consist of the ns5 
ns5 = 1 in d = 10 ii a,b , d5  d5 = 1 in d = 10 ii b and m5  m5 = 1 in d=11
[21]. in a recent paper [8], a 4-angle conguration of this type for the ii a ns5-branes
at sp(2) angles has been found, by directly solving the supergravity and killing spinor
equations, showing that it preserves at least 3/32 of the susy (see however [9, 2, 1, 5]).

6

4 congurations of two non-similar branes

the general worldvolume lagrangian for a (d1 1)-probe in a (d2 1)-source background,
with d1 < d2 [16], gives rise to an expression for l(h; ) as
l = h m/2det1/2(1 + h)

(19)

where  is given by eq.(11) and m is a function of dimensions dened as

m(d1, d2) := 2(d1)(d2) +

d2
d1
d  2

(20)

for marginal congurations, m species the number of (non-vanishing) angles (see [14]
and below). here, (d) represents the dilaton-d-form coupling constant satisfying [18]

2(d) = 1 

d d

2(d  2)

4.1 marginal intersections

the marginality condition, eq.(8), in this case gives

(1 + h)  l2
y

0h m

(h > 0)

(21)

(22)

obviously, such an identity can be true whenever m  z+, and a number m of s to
be +, while the remaining are vanishing. this implies that

1 =    = m = /2
m+1 =    = d11 = v = 0

(23)

the number of common directions then is  = d1  m. therefore:
the only marginal bound state of a pair of non-similar (d1  1, d2  1)-branes are the
static orthogonal congurations in which the two branes share ( 1) of their directions,
where  must satisfy

this is, in fact, the so called intersection rule of the intersecting brane systems, which
was originally found in the study of their supergravity solutions [19, 20], and then re-
appeared in the reduced lagrangian approach to the distributed brane systems in [14]
and was interpreted there as an algebraic constraint 2 required by the no-force conditions
[23].

2in fact, eq.(24) can be viewed as a relation between the gravitational and dilatonic charges
(m, m),  = 1, 2 of the two branes, with m being their masses, for the corresponding forces
to cancel each other [14].

7

 = 2(d1)(d2) +

d1d2
d  2

(24)

4.2 non-marginal intersections

the non-marginality condition, eq.(9), in this case gives the counterpart of eq.(16) as

h m/2{h(1)r
s

  rs} = crs

which in the -diagonalizing basis (eq.(12)) takes the form of the identity

(1 + ha)  c2
y

r h m(1 + hr)2

(h > 0)

(25)

(26)

which is the analogue of eq.(17). obviously, such an identity holds (for each r), if and
only if m  z+, and further (m + 2) of s are innity while the others are vanishing.
therefore,

1 =    = m+2 = /2
m+3 =    = d11 = v = 0

(27)

these are just the conditions (23) in which m has been replaced by (m + 2). so we have
the result:
the only non-marginal bound state of a pair of non-similar (d11, d21)-branes are the
static orthogonal congurations in which the two branes share ( 1) of their directions,
with  satisfying

 + 2 = 2(d1)(d2) +

d1d2
d  2

(28)

which shifts  by a 2 relative to the one given by the rule (24). this is just the same
equation identied as the intersection rule of the localized intersections in [21]. by
the above derivation, however, it has to be identied as a rule for the non-marginal
intersections.

5 congurations with an electromagnetic dual pair

of branes

an electromagnetic dual pair of branes, a priori, can not be placed in either of the two
categories studied in sections 3,4. this is due to the fact that an electromagnetic dual
pair with (d1, d1)-branes is the source of a single d-form potential a(d), which couples
to the two branes through f(d+1) = da(d) and its dual f(d+1) respectively [18]. taking
this point into account, and assuming d  d to adapt with the conventions of section 2,
one obtains the modied version of eq.(4) as



y n  n



  mnl  mnh!  0
l
m

8

(29)

where l is dened in eq.(19) in which m = d  2, and the constants mn are dened as
(30)

mn := mnl1ld1dl1

d/(d!)2

1    ld

here, the two epsilons stand for the levi-civita symbols in the subspaces of (ym) :=
(yr, za) and (x), respectively. the modifying term mnh in eq.(29), however, does not
modify the results of section 4 for the branes at angles with (d1, d2) = (d, d). the reason,
as can be checked using eq.(12), is that in all   1 cases one obtains mn = 0. thus the
rule (24) (with (d) = ( d)) and eq.(21) imply  = 2. hence:
the only marginal conguration of an electromagnetic dual pair of (d  1, d  1)-branes
is a static conguration in which the two branes orthogonally intersect (overlap) on a
string.

on the other hand, a non-marginal conguration should obey the rule (28), which in
this case implies that  = 0. this is in obvious contradiction with the static-ness property
asserted above the rule (28) which means that such congurations of (d, d) can not be
realized.

5.1 non-marginal conguration of parallel branes

the results of the previous sections regarding the non-marginal congurations , in partic-
ular their intersection rule (eq.(28)), are based on the no-torque condition (eq.(7)) which
severly relies on the existence of at least one pair of coordinates (xr, yr) in table (1). since
for a pair of parallel branes (i.e. a conguration of the form d1  d2) there are no such
coordinates, hence the stability condition for such congurations should have a dierent
form. whatever the form of these conditons, they should guarantee that the equations
of motion (eq.(4)) are satised. in the case at hand all a
 s are zero and this equation
reduces to: l/y a = 0, where l(y a) is the same as l(cid:16)h(y a); a
 = 0(cid:17). noting that
h in this case depends only on z a through r := z az a, and further that z a = 0 in the
non-marginal case, the above equation yields:

v (r)
r |r=0 = 0

(31)

where v (r) := l(cid:16)h(r); a

that

q2

 = 0(cid:17). for a pair of non-similar branes we nd from eq.(19)
v (r) = (h(r))m/2 = (cid:18)1 +

rm 2(cid:19)

(32)

m/2

here m := d2 + 2 is the transverse dimension and q2 is (proportional to) the charge of
(d21)-brane and m is dened as in eq.(20). (we have assumed that d1  d2 and d2 > 0.)
it is obvious that v (r) is proportional to the potential energy between the two branes at

9

a separation r and eq.(31) indicates that their mutual forces tend to balance each other
as r  0. now, since in this limit v (r)  rm(m 2)/2, the above condition means that the
function v (r) should be regular near r = 0 at least to the rst order in its derivatives,
requiring that

m(m  2) > 2

2 d2(d  2)

(33)

(34)

or equivalently

12 >

2(d  2)  d1 d2

2

this inequality together with d1  d2 and d2 > 0 in turn species all the non-marginal
bound states of the form of branes within branes. special cases of such congurations
are those with a self dual pair, i.e. with d1 = d , d2 = d. since in this case m = d + 2
, m = d  2, the above condition (assuming d  d) yields: 3  d  (d  2)/2 showing
that such congurations are possible only in d  8 dimensions. famous examples of such
congurations are m2  m5 in d = 11 and the dyonic membrane (bound state of an
electric and a magnetic 2-brane) in d = 8 dimensions, which were known through their
supergravity solutions [22].

6 multi-angle marginal intersections

the results of the previous sections indicate that, except for the 2-angle static congu-
ration of similar branes at su(2) angles, no other conguration of two at branes with
several angles and boost can be marginally stable. while, both the scattering amplitude
and superalgebra computations [5, 2] indicate that multi-angle intersections, under certain
conditions among their angles, can form a marginal conguration, it is amazing that the
worldvolume solutions appropriate to a pair of at branes are not realizable. this apparent
contradiction is resolved by recalling that all the scattering amplitude and superalgebra
computations rely heavily on the basic assumption for the existence of an asymptotic
state in which the branes behave like at hypersurfaces in a minkowski space. in the
string theory language, the perturbative calculation of the scattering amplitudes are reli-
able only in the weak coupling region of the theory where one deals with weak (linearized)
gravitational interactions. this restricts such calculations to the far or asymptotic re-
gion of the two branes where they look like at hypersurfaces in a at spacetime. on the
susy side, also, one does not need to solve a killing spinor equation in all of the space
to determine susy fraction preserved by a brane conguration. to do this, it suces to
solve only the asymptotic (algebraic) killing spinor equation [3, 2, 1], which encodes only
the asymptotic form of the spacetime metric and of the geometry of branes. as a result,
there may be bps states of curved p-branes which look like asymptotically as multi-angle

10

congurations of at p-branes. in the asymptotic region, we will see that the no-force
condition to rst order will require a certain angular constraint which is just the same
that characterizes these bps states [5, 6]. however, the same no-force condition to higher
orders, as well as the no-torque condition, are not satised except for the marginal con-
gurations which were categorized in sections 3,4. this means, rstly, that the marginal
multi-angle congurations, generally, can not consist of at p-branes. secondly, even in
the case of an asymptotically force-free conguration, the relative angular position of the
two branes is inuenced by a non-vanishing torque which eventually brings them together
in general, the force and
by counterbalancing the forces that act between themselves.
torque conditions, eq.(8),(9), are equivalent to a set of algebraic constraints relating 
s
together. this can be seen easily by putting h := 1 + h and expanding l(h; ) as

l(1 + h; ) =

1
n!ln()hn



xn=0

upon this expansion, eqs.(8),(9) give respectively

ln() = 0
ln
  r

sln = 0

r


(35)

(36)

(37)

where n = 1, 2,   . for a real marginal bound state of at p-branes, these two sets
of equations for all n restrict possible congurations to those of sections 3,4. however,
for a conguration of curved p-branes with asymptotic at geometries, we may continue
to dene the marginality property by demanding that l(h; ) to be constant only to
rst order in (h  1) in the asymptotic region h(y)  1. such asymptotic marginal
congurations, thus, are distinguished by a condition on the angles as l1() = 0. this
condition, though provides a mean of translational stability, does not insure rotational
stability of the two brane system, which to be guaranteed by the eq.(37) for n = 1. these
two conditions together, will be seen that, restrict the possible marginal congurations to
those obtained in sections 3,4. we now examine the explicit expressions of these conditions
in the previous cases.

6.1 similar branes

it is easy to see, by expanding eq.(10) to o(h), that in this case

l0() = det1/2(1 + )  1
l1() = det1/2(1 + )(1

where  dependences are encoded in  as is dened in eq.(11). (the expression for l0
is given only for later reference.) diagonalizing  as in eq.(12), the l1 = 0 equation
becomes

sin2  1 = 0

(39)

where, for convenience, we have included the velocity v in s by dening 0 := tan1(iv).
solving eq.(39) for v, however, shows that combinations of boost and rotations for less
than three non-vanishing angles do not dene allowable congurations. indeed, one can
see using eq.(39), that the one- and two-angle congurations are limited only to the
parallel and su(2)-rotated static congurations respectively. if, in addition to the above
condition, one requires rotational stability of the conguration, eq.(37) for n = 1 gives

f

the only simultaneous solutions of eqs.(39),(40), when more than two s exist, are the
one with

1 = 2 , 0 = 3 =    = d1 = 0

(41)

and its permutations for s ( 6= 0). that is, the only rotationally stable marginal
congurations are those with su(2) angles.

6.2 non-similar branes

in this case eq.(19) gives

l0() = det1/2(1 + )

this gives, in fact, a modication of the usual intersection rule, eq.(24), to the general case
involving arbitrary boost and angles between the two branes. obviously, an orthogonal
static limit, with s equal to 0, /2, exists only in cases with m  z+. that is, for
an orthogonal intersection, the rule (24) must hold and in such a case m counts the
number of  = /2 angles. despite eq.(39), the eq.(43) allows for the possibility of the

12

combinations of a boost with any number of angles. specially, when m  0, one can nd
(asymptotically) boosted congurations of two parallel branes having a relative velocity
v = q m
m1. however, congurations dened by eq.(43) are not rotationally stable, unless

we have

f


= 2sincos = 0

(44)

which means that s must be 0, /2. therefore, the rotationally stable marginal cong-
urations are the static ones with orthogonal branes obeying the rule (24).

7 small perturbations on the worldvolume

so far, we have stressed on the fact that every equilibrium conguration of two at
p-branes is specied by the two requirements, eqs.(6),(7), which we have interpreted as
the no-force and no-torque conditions respectively. in this section, we try to make this
correspondences explicit by perturbing the worldvolume of one of the branes (the probe)
with respect to its at state, while the other brane (the source) is kept at and xed.
this type of description is similar to the one which is used in [16]. to be concrete, we
rst present a perturbative formulation of the classical solutions for a general eld theory
with one expansion parameter, and then consider its application to the worldvolume eld
theory of the probe.

7.1 general eld theory formulation

assume that a eld theory, for the variable(s) (x), is dened by means of the perturbative
lagrangian

l[; ] = l0[] + l1[] +

2
2 l2[] +   

(45)

with  being the perturbation parameter. now, take 0(x) to represent a classical solution
of the unperturbed lagrangian l0[], i.e., it satises the equation of motion: l0
 = 0. the
question, which we like to answer, is that how can we specify a solution of the perturbed
lagrangian which tends to 0(x) when   0. obviously, such a solution must obey the
expansion

(x; ) = 0(x) + 1(x) +

2(x) +   

(46)

2
2

putting this expansion in eq.(45), and using the functional taylor series expansion of
lns, the overall expansion of l[(x; ); ] in powers of  takes the form 3
l[0, 1,  ; ] = l0[0] +  l0

(47)
where all lns and their functional derivatives are evaluated at  = 0. treating {n} as
a set of independent variables, and varying l with respect to these variables, one picks
the set of equations

l0


= 0

3in fact, such an equation is only a symbolic expression in which the functional derivatives of lns are
in the form of local operators, acting on the functions which are multiplied by themselves, summed over
the eld indices and are nally integrated over the spacetime coordinates.

(48)

these equations, in principle , determine the solutions for 0(x), 1(x), etc. in the suc-
cessive order. it is worth-pointing that, except for 0(x) which is assumed to be a given
solution of l0, all other ns are determined by solving a linear inhomogeneous pde of
the form

2l0
2 n = jn

(49)

where the source term jn(x) in the n-th stage is a known function of x, constructed from
0(x),, n1(x). for vanishing boundary conditions on ns, one solves eq.(49) symbol-
ically as n = gjn, with g representing the greens function of the linear operator 2l0
at  = 0. if l0, as in usual, is a rst order lagrangian in terms of the -derivatives, then
2l0
2 will be a second order linear dierential operator with (in general) spacetime depen-
dent coecients, whose greens function is constructed in the usual manner. the above
procedure, thus eventually, determines (x; ) to any arbitrary order in the expansion
parameter .

7.2 application to the worldvolume eld theory

we consider a source-probe conguration of arbitrary branes, as in [16], and choose the
embedding of the probe, as in section 2, to be represented by y a = y a(x). it is clear
that the worldvolume lagrangian of the probe has a generic form as

l[y ] = l(cid:16)h(y a), y a(cid:17)

(50)

where the explicit dependences on y a are encoded in the harmonic function h of the
transverse distance from the source, which is proportional to its charge or tension ts,
and vanishes asymptotically. obviously, taking the limit ts  0 is equivalent to going to
the asymptotic region of y a, where the source and probe have a large separation, and in
this limit eq.(50) takes the form of an ordinary lagrangian of a minimal surface in the
minkowski space. taking this as the unperturbed lagrangian l0, and treating ts as a
perturbation parameter, the perturbed lagrangian l will be expanded as

xn=0
which is nothing but the eq.(35) with a
 s replaced by y as. also, it is clear that l0 has
classical solutions which are in the form of at hypersurfaces, similar to the one in eq.(1),

hn(y )ln(y )

l[y ] =

(51)



1
n!

15

which plays here the role of the unperturbed solution y a
0 (x). the main advantage of
this choice for y a
0 (x) is that it renders ln[y0]s as constant parameters ln(). this means
that we are interested in a probe whose worldvolume geometry, in the region far from the
source, is that of a at hypersurfaces, though it may be curved in the near region. thus,
perturbing the at solutions as y a(x) = y a
1 (x) +   , and using the general
formulation of the previous subsection, one nds that the rst order perturbation, y a
1 (x),
obeys the equation

0 (x) + y a

2l0

  abl1! bh(y0) = 0

(52)

the eq.(52) represents a system of second order pde with the constant coecients

 2l0

and source terms which are linear combinations of bh(y0(x)). now, using the expression
(38) or (42) for l0(), one can show that

(57)

where we have used the fact that ih = 0. the operator a appearing above is
indeed the d alembertian operator along the probes worldvolume coordinates, as can
be seen by the eq.(12),

a =

1  v2  2

0 + cos21 2

1 +    + cos2p 2

(58)

thus the eqs.(55)-(57) are written as the equations describing the propagation of waves
along the probe with or without external sources. perturbations in the yi directions
propagate as free waves, as is expected by the homogeneity of the space along these
coordinates, while those in za and yr directions propagate as the forced oscillations. the

16

eq.(56), describing the transverse oscillations, resembles a force equation while eq.(57),
describing the longitudinal oscillations, is the reminiscent of a torque equation. in the
equilibrium conditions, with y a
1 = 0, eqs.(56),(57) reduce to the eqs.(36),(37) for n =
1 component. these same conditions, for higher order y a
n s, reproduce the higher n
components of the eqs.(36),(37), and nally one recovers the eqs.(8),(9). as a result, our
perturbative approach provides physical interpretations for eqs.(8),(9) as the balancing
conditions of the force and torque, respectively.

8 conclusion

this paper categorizes several congurations of two arbitrary branes at angles which are
derivable from the dbi+wz action for p-branes. in using this dynamics for p-branes,
we have implicitly assumed that all types of internal gauge elds of the branes as well as
the background b eld are vanishing. in this way all types of p-branes (e.g., ns-, d- and
m-branes) are treated in a similar manner by using the dynamics of dbi+wz action.

further, we have assumed that neither of the two branes is aected by the elds that
originate from itself, at least when it is stretched as a at hypersurface (the bps or no-
force condition for single branes). thus, the wz term contribute to the dynamics, when
we deal with similar branes carrying the same (p-form) charges, and it is vanishing when
the the branes are non-similar carrying dierent charges. under these assumptions, the
analysis for both of these cases reveals two types of congurations: the marginal and the
non-marginal ones. in the marginal case, we found that the only conguration of similar
branes at angles is the one with two angles in a subgroup of su(2), while the only one
for non-similar branes is an orthogonal conguration obeying the ordinary intersection
rule [19]. in this case, no conguration with more than two angles can be found [16].
in the non-marginal case, on the other hand, we saw that the only conguration with
similar branes is the one with four angles in two independent subgroups of su(2), while
the only one for non-similar branes is an orthogonal conguration obeying an unusual rule
of intersection, previously identied as the localized branes intersection rule [21]. while,
the whole analysis in this paper considers only two brane congurations, the n brane
congurations can also be undertaken by a similar analysis, provided one knows the back-
ground elds for each (n  1) of these branes. though, for marginal congurations, this
does not seem to give additional information other than those for pair-wise intersections,
it may be a useful device for investigating about the non-marginal congurations made
up of several branes. it should be emphasized here that marginal multi-angle congura-
tions, other than those stated in the above which all had been found in the context of the
classical supergravity solutions, no other marginal conguration can be constructed from

17

a set of at p-branes. this is why the solutions of this kind had not been discovered in
the supergravity solutions literature. (this, however, does not prevent the possibility of
having non-marginal solutions with several angles.) it is tempting to ask that whether
one can form marginal multi-angle congurations by putting suitable curvatures on their
worldvolumes. of course, in such a case one has to dene rigorously the marginality
property.
in the case of asymptotic at p-branes, we dened it as the stability of the
conguration at arbitrary separation of the two branes as measured in their asymptotic
region. we have answered the above question, only partially , by perturbing the world-
volume of one of the branes when it is posed to the background of the other unperturbed
brane, and nd that the marginality requirement, in general, breaks the conditions for
the atness of the worldvolume. a general treatment requires propagating both of the
branes and looking for the conditions that need to be asymptotically at.
