abstract

a reparametrization invariant model, introduced recently by montesinos, rovelli and thie-
mann, possessing an sl(2, r) gauge symmetry is treated along the guidelines of an algebraic
constraint quantization scheme that translates the vanishing of the constraints into represen-
tation conditions for the algebra of observables. the application of this algebraic scheme to
the sl(2, r) model yields an unambiguous identication of the physical representation of the
algebra of observables.

1 introduction

in ref. [mrt], montesinos, rovelli, and thiemann have introduced a reparametrization in-
variant model with an sl(2, r) gauge symmetry which, in a nite-dimensional context, mim-
icks the constraint structure of general relativity.

in this note i do not want to enter into a discussion of the physical signicance of the
model. rather, i will regard the system from the point of view of an algebraic scheme for
the quantization of constrained systems (presented in ref. [tr]), which lays emphasis on the
quantization of observable quantities, translating the vanishing of the constraints into repre-
sentation conditions for the algebra of observables. the sl(2, r) model presents an interesting
example for the application of the algebraic scheme, because the model displays a peculiar
structural feature that sheds some light upon the working of the method (for a retrospective
characterization of this feature, cf the conclusions). also, the treatment of the model presents
an application of the algebraic constraint quantization scheme to a reparametrization invari-
ant system with a non-trivial gauge group (as opposed to the  almost obvious  application
to the free relativistic particle), possessing constraints which are quadratic in the momenta.
the construction of the quantum theory of the sl(2, r) model according to the alge-
braic constraint quantization scheme results in an unambiguous identication of the physical
representation of the algebra of observables. moreover, i show how the construction of the
quantum theory according to the dirac quantization scheme, that has been left unnished in
ref. [mrt], can be completed: in contrast to the approach followed here, the authors of ref.
[mrt] concentrate on the quantization of the constraints (i.e., of unobservable quantities)
which does not automatically yield the correct quantization of the observables.

2 classical analysis of the model

2.1 constraints and observables

the conguration space of the model presented in ref. [mrt] is r4, parametrized by the
euclidean variables ~u = (u1, u2)t and ~v = (v1, v2)t . the model is dened by the lagrangian

l = q~v2( ~u  ~u)2 +q~u2( ~v + ~v)2.

the multiplier  can be eliminated with the help of its equation of motion (two of the
multipliers of ref. [mrt] have already been eliminated), i.e. by solving the equation l/ =
0 for :  = (~u, ~u, ~v, ~v). the function  being homogeneous of order one in the velocities,

(~u,  ~u, ~v,  ~v) =  (~u, ~u, ~v, ~v), the action s = r dt l is invariant under reparametrizations

of t.

as a consequence of the denition of the canonical momenta,

~p :=

l
 ~u

=

~v2 ( ~u  ~u)
q~v2( ~u  ~u)2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = (~u, ~u, ~v, ~v)

,

~ :=

l
 ~v

=

~u2 ( ~v + ~v)
q~v2( ~v + ~v)2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = (~u, ~u, ~v, ~v)

,

there are three primary constraints

l1 =

l2 =

l3 =

(h1 + h2) =

(~u  ~p  ~v  ~) = 0,

(h1  h2) =

(~p 2 + ~u2  ~2  ~v2) = 0.

the canonical hamiltonian of the model vanishes, h = ~p ~u+~ ~vl = 0. the constraints are
rstclass, their poisson commutation relations close to form a realization of the lie algebra
sl(2, r) = so(2, 1) = su(1, 1):

{la, lb} =  c

ab lc,

 c
ab = gcdabd,

123 = 1,

a, b, c, d  {1, 2, 3},

where gab is the inverse of the so(2, 1)metric gab = diag(+, +,), and repeated indices are
summed over.
the innitesimal canonical transformations generated by the constraints can be integrated
to yield an action of the gauge group sl(2, r) on the space r8 = t r4: it acts in its dening
two-dimensional representation on the vectors

~x(1) = (cid:18)u1
p1(cid:19) ,

~x(2) = (cid:18)u2
p2(cid:19) ,

~x(3) = (cid:18)1
v1(cid:19) ,

~x(4) = (cid:18)2
v2(cid:19) ,

i.e., (~x(1), . . . , ~x(4))

gsl(2,r)

 (g~x(1), . . . , g~x(4)).

2.2 regularization
the map l : r8  so(2, 1), (~u, ~v, ~p, ~) 7 la(~u, ~v, ~p, ~) (so(2, 1) is the dual of the lie algebra
so(2, 1); l is the so-called momentum map), is not free of critical points where the constraints
la cease to be functionally independent. a point q  r8 is a critical point of l if and only if
the two vectors

(1) = (u1, u2, 1, 2)t ,

(2) = (p1, p2, v1, v2)t ,

are linearly dependent. in order to avoid the occurrence of physical states which cannot be
interpreted in terms of observables (see below) the set s of critical points of l, that is stable
under the action of sl(2, r), must be removed from r8. consequently, the phase space of
the system is p = (r8 \ s, ), with the symplectic form  that is induced from the canonical
symplectic form  on t r4.

2.3 observables
the action of sl(2, r) leaves invariant the determinants oij := det(~x(i), ~x(j)) = oji. there-
fore, the (continuous) fundamental observables [tr] of the system can be chosen to be

m1 := o23 = u2v1  p21, m2 := o31 = u1v1 + p11, m3 := o12 = u1p2  u2p1,
n1 := o14 = u1v2  p12, n2 := o24 = u2v2  p22, n3 := o43 = v12  v21.

the poisson commutation relations of the fundamental observables close to form a realization
of the lie algebra so(2, 2):
{ma, mb} =  c

{na, nb} =  c
which is isomorphic to so(2, 1) so(2, 1), as can be seen by dening qa := 1
2 (ma  na), whence the commutation relations read
{qa, pb} = 0,

{ma, nb} =  c

{pa, pb} =  c

ab pc.

{qa, qb} =  c

ab qc,

2 (ma + na), pa :=

ab mc,

ab nc,

ab mc,

1

alternatively, the commutation relations can be written in the standard form

{q+, q} = iq3,

{q3, q} =  iq,

q :=

1
2

(q1  iq2),

(1)

2

and likewise for p. again, the innitesimal canonical transformations generated by the fun-
damental observables can be integrated, this time to yield an action of the group so0(2, 2)
(the connected component of so(2, 2) containing the identity) on the phase space p, acting
in its dening four-dimensional representation on the vectors (1) and (2):

((1), (2))

hso0(2,2)

 (h(1), h(2))

(obviously, the set s is stable under the action of so0(2, 2) on r8). in addition, there are
the discrete fundamental observables (reections) rxy, (x, y)  {(u1, p1), (u2, p2), (1, v1),
(2, v2)}, which change the sign of the coordinates x and y, leaving all other coordinates
invariant. only two of them are independent (taking into account the action of so0(2, 2)),
say r1 := r2v2 and r2 := r2v2  ru1p1. together with qa and pa they generate an action of
the group o(2, 2) on the phase space. the action of the discrete observables r1 and r2 on
the continuous observables is given by

r1 : qa  pa,

r2 : (q3, p3)  (q3,p3),

(q, p)  (q, p).

(2)

finally, there is a involution (complex conjugation) on the classical algebra of observables
(i.e., the poisson algebra generated polynomially by the fundamental observables qa and pa
that comprises the action of r1 and r2), acting on the fundamental observables like

(q3, q, p3, p, r1, r2)  (q

3, q

, p

3, p

, r

1, r

2) = (q3, q, p3, p, r1, r2).

(3)

2.4 the observable content of the constraints

by denition [tr], the observable content of the constraints comprises the conditions which
are imposed on the (casimir) invariants of the algebra of observables by the vanishing of the
constraints (via functional dependencies between the invariants of the algebra of observables
and the generalized casimir elements of the constraints [tr]). upon quantization, these
conditions are turned into representation conditions which select the physical representation(s)
of the algebra of observables.

q+q + qq+  q2
invariant (where the sign can be equal to either plus one, zero, or minus one).

the lie algebra so(2, 2) possesses two quadratic casimir operators, q2 := gabqaqb =
3 and p2 := gabpapb. if q2  0 (p2  0), the sign of q3 (p3) is another
in the realization of the lie algebra so(2, 2) by the observables of the model at hand,
there are two identities which reect the functional dependencies between the casimirs of the
algebra of observables and the casimir l2 := gablalb of the constraint algebra:

p2  l2  0.
upon the vanishing of the constraints they induce the identities

q2  l2  0,

q2 = 0,

p2 = 0.

(4)

(5)

in addition, there are further identities which determine the signs of q3 and p3. these
identities involve the generators qapb of a poisson ideal in the algebra of observables. only
one of them is independent:

2 q3p3  [(~u2  ~v2) l1  (~u  ~p + ~v  ~) l2 + (~u2 + ~v2) l3]  0,

(6)

3

in the sense that the others can be obtained from it via (repeated) poisson bracket operation
with qa and pa. the vanishing of the constraints induces the identities

which possess the solutions ( is the logical or)

qapb = 0,

[ qa = 0 a ]  [ pa = 0 a ].

these identities can be translated into conditions involving the signs of q3 and p3:

[ sign(q3) = 0 ]  [ sign(p3) = 0 ].

(7)

(8)

now, the observables oij = oij(~u, ~v, ~p, ~), regarded as functions on r8, vanish for all pairs (ij)
of the indices if and only if (~u, ~v, ~p, ~)  s. therefore, on the phase space p the conditions
(8) take on the form

( [ sign(q3) = 0 ]  [ sign(p3) = 0 ] )  ( [ sign(q3) = 0 ]  [ sign(p3) = 0 ] )

(9)

( is and,  is not). the latter conditions, together with the induced identities (5),
express the observable content of the constraints.

2.5 the structure of the space of physical states

the topological structure of the space of physical states (i.e., the reduced phase space) is
determined entirely by the observable content of the constraints. as the action of the group
so0(2, 2) on (the linear span of) the observables qa and pa coincides with the coadjoint
action of so0(2, 2) on the dual so(2, 2) = so(2, 1)q  so(2, 1)p of its lie algebra so(2, 2) =
so(2, 1)q  so(2, 1)p , the space of physical states is the disjoint union of several coadjoint
orbits for so0(2, 2) which, in their turn, are labelled by the values of the invariants.
the identity q2 = 0 characterizes the light cone cq in so(2, 1)q, which falls into
three pieces: the forward light cone c+
q (sign(q3) = +1), the backward light cone c
q
(sign(q3) = 1), and the origin c0
q (sign(q3) = 0) (and similarly for p). therefore, according
to the conditions (5) and (9), the space of physical states consists of four pieces (orbits for
so0(2, 2)):

ci = c+

q  c0
p ,

cii = c

q  c0
p ,

ciii = c0

q  c+
p ,

civ = c0

q  c
p .

these four pieces constitute one orbit c = ci  cii  ciii  civ for o(2, 2), consisting of four
connected components that are mapped onto one another by the discrete observables r1, r2
and r1  r2 (corresponding to the four connected components of the group o(2, 2)).

3 construction of the quantum theory

i will now construct the quantum theory of the model, following the quantization scheme
outlined in ref. [tr].

4

3.1 the quantum algebra of observables

the rst step is the construction of the quantum algebra of observables. the quantum
algebra of observables is generated polynomially by the fundamental observables { qa, pa},
the unambiguous quantum analogs of the classical fundamental observables {qa, pa}, and an
action of the discrete observables {r1, r2}, the quantum analogs of the classical observables
{r1, r2}, has to be dened on it. up to quantum corrections, the commutation relations of
the observables qa and pa have to be inferred from the poisson commutation relations of the
corresponding classical observables.

the only quantum correction of the classical so(2, 2) commutation relations compatible
with the principles formulated in ref. [tr] would be a central extension of the algebra so(2, 2).
however, as the second cohomology of the algebra so(2, 2) is trivial (so(2, 2) being semi
simple), there is no nontrivial central extension available (cf [wo]), and the commutation
relations have to be taken to be

[ qa, qb] = i  c

ab

qc,

[ qa, pb] = 0,

[pa, pb] = i  c

ab

pc.

the action of the discrete observables cannot pick up quantum corrections. according to
equation (2), it is given by ( q and p are dened as in the classical theory, cf (1))

r1 ( qa, pa) r1 = (pa, qa),

r2 ( q3, p3) r2 = ( q3,p3),

r2 ( q, p) r2 = ( q, p). (10)

3.2 the observable content of the constraints

the next step is the determination of the form that the conditions (5) and (9) assume
upon quantization. the casimir operators of so(2, 2) being unambiguously dened, q2 :=
3, p2 := gab pa pb, the only consistent quantum corrections of
gab qa qb = q+ q + q q+  q2
the identities (5) are by constants:

q2  cq2 = 0,

p2  cp 2 = 0,

cq = const., cp = const..

however, these corrections have to vanish as can be seen by the following argument: the
conditions (9), concerning the signs of q3 and p3, cannot acquire quantum corrections, i.e.
their quantum counterparts have to read

( [ sign( q3) = 0 ]  [ sign(p3) = 0 ] )  ( [ sign( q3) = 0 ]  [ sign(p3) = 0 ] )

(11)
(sign( o) = 1, 0, +1 means that the operator o is negative denite, zero, or positive denite,
respectively). but the condition sign( q3) = 0 is only compatible with the identity q2 = 0,
and analogously for p2, thereby enforcing the identities

q2 = 0,

p2 = 0.

(12)

3.3 the physical representations of the algebra of observables

the nal step is the identication of the physical representations of the algebra of observables,
making use of the observable content of the constraints as it is expressed by the conditions
(11) and (12), and of the hermiticity relations

( q3, q, p3, p, r1, r2)  ( q

, r

1, r

2) = ( q3, q, p3, p, r1, r2),

3, q

, p

3, p

5

which implement the classical relations (3) into the quantum theory and require the rep-
resentations to be hermitian (corresponding to unitary representations of the group o(2, 2)).
as the hermitian representations of the lie algebra so(2, 2) are the tensor products of the
hermitian representations of the factors so(2, 1)q and so(2, 1)p , it is sucient to determine
the latter.

there are three hermitian irreducible representations of so(2, 1)q which are selected uni-
quely by the conditions q2 = 0 and sign( q3) = 1, 0, +1 (for a classication of the hermitian
irreducible representations of so(2, 1) see ref. [wy]): the representation d
q(1), the trivial
representation 1lq, and the representation d+
q(1), respectively (in the notation of ref. [wy]).
the representations are spanned by orthonormal states (m  n)

|  miq for d

q(1),

|0iq for 1lq,

|miq for d+

q(1).

the action of q3 and q on these states is given by (n = m, 0, m)

q3 |niq = n|niq,

q |niq =



2 pn(n  1) |n  1iq.

(13)

analogously, there are three hermitian irreducible representations d
p (1) of
so(2, 1)p , selected uniquely by the conditions p2 = 0 and sign(p3) = 1, 0, +1, respectively.
as a consequence, the observable content of the constraints, conditions (11) and (12),
selects uniquely four hermitian irreducible representations of the lie algebra so(2, 2), cor-
responding to the four orbits which make up the classical space of physical states, namely
di = d+
p (1),
spanned by the states |m, 0i = |miq  |0ip , |  m, 0i = |  miq  |0ip , |0, mi = |0iq  |mip ,
|0,mi = |0iq  |  mip , respectively. the physical hilbert space hphys is the direct sum of
(the carrier spaces of) these four representations.

q(1)  1lp , diii = 1lq  d+

p (1), div = 1lq  d

q(1)  1lp , dii = d

p (1), 1lp , d+

finally, dening the action of the discrete observables r1 and r2 on hphys by
r1 |n, 0i = |0, ni,

r2 |n, 0i = |  n, 0i,

r1 |0, ni = |n, 0i,

r2 |0, ni = |0,ni,

the requirements (10) are satised, and hphys carries one unitary irreducible representation
d = di  dii  diii  div of the group o(2, 2).

4 comparison with the dirac quantization

the phase space p not being a cotangent bundle, the canonical dirac quantization scheme
does not seem to be an appropriate setting for the construction of the quantum theory of
the sl(2, r) model. nevertheless, it is possible to - at least abstractly - complete the dirac
quantization that has been left unnished in ref. [mrt].

4.1 constraints and physical states
the authors of ref. [mrt] represent the constraints as symmetric operators h1 (=: l1 + l3),
h2 (=: l1  l3) and d (=: 2 l2) with the so(2, 1) commutation relations [la, lb] = i  c
lc
on the hilbert space h = l2(r4, d2u d2v). the concrete expressions for these operators can
be obtained from the classical ones upon substituting the multiplicative operators ~u = ~u and
~v = ~v for the classical coordinates ~u and ~v, and the dierential operators ~p = i ~u and ~ =
i ~v for the classical momenta ~p and ~, leaving the order of the coordinates and momenta

ab

6

unchanged. they determine the physical states of the system as distributional solutions
of the dierential equations la (~u, ~v) = 0.
in polar coordinates, ~u = (u cos , u sin )t ,
~v = (v cos , v sin )t , these solutions are given by

m,(u, v, , ) = eim(+) jm(uv/),

where  = 1, m  z, and jm(z) are bessel functions. (by the way: there are also other
physical states, e.g. the states  = exp{i ~u~v/} and all states that can be obtained from
them via the action of observables.) the authors do not specify an inner product on these
states, i.e. they do not construct a physical hilbert space. furthermore, they represent only
the generators of the maximal compact subgroup so(2)  so(2) of so0(2, 2) as symmetric
operators on h, which is not sucient for the determination of the representations of the full
algebra of observables.

4.2 observables
the classical observables qa and pa can be represented as symmetric operators qa and pa on
h in the same way as the constraints (i.e., by the same substitutions; there are no ordering
ambiguities). the observables obey the commutation relations

[ qa, qb] = i  c

ab

qc,

[ qa, pb] = 0,

[pa, pb] = i  c

ab

pc

and commute with the constraint operators. with the concrete expressions for the observ-
ables and constraints the quantum counterparts of the classical identities (4) and (6) can be
computed explicitly. they read

q2  l2  0,

p2  l2  0

and

2 q3 p3  [(~u

2

2

 ~v

) l1  (~u  ~p + ~v  ~) l2 + (~u

2

2

+ ~v

) l3]  0,

(14)

(15)

again, the missing identities can be obtained from (15) via (repeated) commutator operation
with qa and pa. on the linear space v of physical states the identities (14) and (15) induce
the identities

q2 = 0,

p2 = 0,

qa pb = 0,

which coincide with the classical identities (5) and (7).

4.3 representations
the representations of so(2, 1)qso(2, 1)p which are realized on the linear space v of physical
states can be identied by explicitly computing the action of q3, q, p3 and p on the states
m,. in polar coordinates these operators are given by ( oa(+1) := qa, oa(1) := pa)
(cid:17)i.
o3() =

the invariant subspace v +

(and similarly for p3 and p, with the roles of m,+ and m, interchanged). equation (16)
(and its counterpart for p) shows that the linear space v contains ve invariant subspaces
for the action of so(2, 2): v +
p = {m,|m  0},
v 
p = {m,|m  0}, and v0 = {0,+ = 0,}. the space v is not the direct sum of these
invariant subspaces, as all spaces have the subspace v0 in common. this means, that the
representation of so(2, 2) on v is reducible, but not fully reducible (i.e., it is indecomposable).
q carries a representation of so(2, 1)q. in the notation of ref.
[wy] it is the representation d+
q(0). this representation is also indecomposable, as it con-
tains the invariant subspace v0 and as the action of q maps 1,+ into v0. this latter fact
means that the sign of q3 is not invariant (it changes from plus one to zero), showing that
the observable content of the constraints is not reproduced correctly. moreover, the represen-
tation is not unitary. for, assume that there exists a scalar product h|i on v +
q , such that
hm,+|m,+i = mm (m, m  0, m,+ = nm m,+, nm non-zero and nite normalization
constants) and such that q

+ = q. then, from equation (16) one nds

which implies the contradiction

however, it is possible to (abstractly) introduce a degenerate scalar product on (an abstract
q which allows to turn v +
q into a hilbert space that

introduce a degenerate scalar product (|) on these states by requiring

(0|0) = 0,

(0|m) = 0,

(m|m) = |nm|2 mm

(m, m  n, nm are non-zero and nite complex normalization constants). denote the equiv-
alence classes (i.e., states modulo zero norm states) of nm |m), m  n, by |mi. the induced
scalar product on these states is hm|mi = mm, and the action of the operators q3 and q
is given by

also the phase)

and a comparison with equation (13) reveals, that the hilbert space h+
q, which is spanned
by the states |mi and equipped with the scalar product h|i, carries the hermitian irreducible
representation d+
q(1)1lp of so(2, 1)qso(2, 1)p ,
i.e., the states |mi can be identied with the states |m, 0i of sec. 3.3).

basis states of the space v  v0 and those of the direct sum of the hilbert spaces h
q and
h
p . in this way the results of sec. 3.3 can be reproduced.

in an analogous fashion, the invariant subspaces v

5 conclusions

in this note i hope to have demonstrated that the algebraic method is an eective and natural
(in the sense of being well adapted to the problem) tool for the construction of the quantum
theory of constrained systems.

let me point out a peculiar structural feature that makes the sl(2, r) model an interesting
example for the application of the method, emphasizing the crucial role that is played by the
correct identication of the observable content of the constraints: for the determination of the
observable content of the constraints it is necessary to take into account not only the direct
functional dependencies (equations (4)) between the casimirs of the algebra of observables
and those of the constraint algebra, but also dependencies (equation (6) and its poisson
bracket transforms) between the generators of an ideal within the algebra of observables and
generalized casimir elements of the constraints. however, the conditions that are imposed by
the vanishing of the constraints via the latter dependencies can be reformulated as restrictions
on the values of the invariants of the algebra of observables, cf equation (9).

acknowledgement: i thank g. handrich for drawing my attention to the peculiar structure
of the sl(2, r) model, for several helpful discussions, and for critically reading the manuscript.

postscript: some time after the completion of the present note the preprint [lr] appeared,
where the authors louko and rovelli construct the quantum theory of the sl(2, r) model
using the quantization schemes of algebraic quantization and rened algebraic quanti-
zation, arriving at essentially the same results as in the treatment given here. a comparison
of the conceptual and technical advantages and disadvantages of the various schemes is left
to the reader. i just want to point out that the approach presented here does not make use of
any input motivated by the structure of the classical constraints [lr], and that it does not
depend on making successful choices in the early steps which may require hindsight from
the later steps [lr]. to be sure, just like algebraic quantization and rened alge-
braic quantization the algebraic quantization scheme followed here is not a prescription for
quantization [lr] which can do without any input, but here the input is taken exclusively
from the observable sector of the system in question  in the form of correspondence and
consistency requirements which are imposed on observable quantities.
