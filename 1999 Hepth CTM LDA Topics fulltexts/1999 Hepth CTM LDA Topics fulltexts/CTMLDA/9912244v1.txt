we study renormalization-group ow patterns in theories arising on d1-branes in

various supersymmetry-breaking backgrounds. we argue that the theory of n d1-branes

transverse to an orbifold space can be ne-tuned to ow to the corresponding orbifold

conformal eld theory in the infrared, for particular values of the couplings and theta

angles which we determine using the discrete symmetries of the model. by calculating

various nonplanar contributions to the scalar potential in the worldvolume theory, we

show that ne-tuning is in fact required at nite n, as would be generically expected.

we further comment on the presence of singular conformal eld theories (such as those

whose target space includes a throat described by an exactly solvable cft) in the

non-supersymmetric context. throughout the analysis two applications are considered: to

gauge theory/gravity duality and to linear sigma model techniques for studying worldsheet

string theory.

1. introduction

getting a handle on the quantum behavior of non-supersymmetric systems is im-

portant in order to be able to concretely approach hierarchy problems and other aspects

of supersymmetry breaking. this is also ultimately important in studying any theory,

supersymmetric or not, since generic phenomena are not protected by supersymmetry.

in this paper we will analyze the quantum eld theories arising on d1-branes in vari-

ous supersymmetry-breaking backgrounds. we will focus mostly on d1-branes transverse

to symmetric orbifold singularities, but will for comparison consider also d1-branes in

combination with d5-branes and transverse to asymmetric orbifold backgrounds.

we have in mind two main motivations (or potential applications for these theories).

the rst concerns their role in gravity/gauge theory dualities [1][2]. the strong coupling

regime in the rg ow of the worldvolume theory of d1-branes in at space has a weakly-

coupled supergravity dual [3]. on a circle, this theory denes matrix string theory [4];

there the strong coupling regime of the rg ow provides a non-perturbative formulation

of interacting string theory.

it would be very nice to know whether this ow pattern

persists in situations with less supersymmetry. in particular we would like to understand

whether the regime of nite (but large) yang-mills gauge coupling survives, whether a

mass gap develops, and so on. as in [5], one can use the gravity/gauge theory duality to

translate the question of whether a string-scale vacuum energy arises into a potentially

simpler question in the dual gauge theory. the second application is to linear sigma model

techniques [6][7][8] for studying worldsheet conformal eld theory via a relatively simple

ultraviolet eld theory that ows to the desired cft in the infrared.

as we will review, in the large-n limit this ow pattern does persist for quiver

gauge theories [9][10] obtained on d1-branes at orbifold singularities [5][11][12]. even for

nite n, these theories have the promising feature that the target space (classical moduli

space) of the theory in the ultraviolet would, if taken as the target space of a sigma model,

produce a conformal eld theory (here simply the corresponding orbifold conformal eld

theory). this is quite dierent from the situation obtained in studying, for example, the
cipn model, for which the classical moduli space is not ricci-at, and in which a large-n

analysis reveals the presence of a mass gap [13].

because of the promising start the quiver theories have at leading order in the 1/n

expansion, it is worth checking explicitly whether these pleasant features persist at nite

n. we nd by explicit calculation that they do not for generic (1 + 1)d quiver theories.

1

(similar questions in (3 + 1)d were studied by explicit calculation in [14][15]). we show,

by way of constrast, that they do persist, at the order we compute, for the worldvolume

theories arising on d1-branes transverse to asymmetric orbifolds such as [16].

we argue, using various simple features of this type of model (such as the form of the

uv target space mentioned above), that the quiver gauge theories can however be ne-

tuned to ow to the corresponding orbifold conformal eld theory for particular choices of

the couplings and -angles. in particular we show how to identify using the quiver theories

the values of the theta angles at the orbifold conformal eld theory point for zzk orbifolds

with k > 2 (as determined using wrapped d-branes in [17], giving a generalization of the

result for zz2 orbifolds determined by aspinwall [18]).

this statement about the ow involves a comparison of relevant operators and discrete

symmetries in the two limiting theories. the situation might be compared to that of non-

supersymmetric landau-ginzburg theories which ow to minimal model cfts in the ir

[6]. it has potential utility as an approach for studying twisted-sector tachyon condensation

in perturbative string theory. the fact that there is a eld theory ow between the two

limiting theories raises the interesting question as to whether there is a gravitational dual

to this trajectory in coupling space.

in supersymmetric contexts, one often nds subspaces on the moduli space of 2d

conformal eld theories on which the cft becomes singular. (examples are the points

of non-perturbatively enhanced gauge symmetry in type iia compactication on k3 [19],

the conifold singularities of calabi-yau compactication [20][8], and the small instanton

singularities of the d1-d5 system [21].) we study a simple model (based trivially on a cft

that factorizes into a supersymmetric part times a nonsupersymmetric part) in which this

persists without supersymmetry and discuss the potential implications for the spacetime

string background described by this worldsheet conformal eld theory.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in 2 we introduce the theories we will study.
in 3 we discuss the symmetry structure, operator content, and target space geometry
of the quiver yang-mills theories (with particularly symmetric choices for the parameters

of the gauge theories) and compare them to those of the corresponding orbifold cft.

the agreement between the two provides strong evidence that the quiver theories ow

(upon appropriate ne-tuning) to the corresponding orbifold cft in the infrared, as we
explain in 3.3; we discuss interesting applications of this fact in 3.4. in 4 we present
calculations which show that ne-tuning is in fact required at subleading orders in the

1/n expansion of the non-supersymmetric quiver theories; we constrast this to the case

2

of d-branes at asymmetric orbifolds where such ne-tuning is not required at the order
we compute. finally, in 5 we discuss a simple example of a non-supersymmetric string
background in which the worldsheet cft becomes singular and consider the worldvolume

theories on d-branes in such backgrounds.

2. the theories

in this section we present the theories we will study. most of our analysis will involve
the symmetric orbifold theories in 2.1, which we will compare and contrast with analogous
results for the theories in 2.2 and 2.3.

2.1. quiver theory

the worldvolume theories on dp-branes at symmetric orbifold singularities were
worked out in [10][9]. in general, one can consider an orbifold c4/ where  is a sub-
group of the poincare group of c4. the orbifold group acts on the chan-paton factors on

the open string endpoints in addition to acting on the lorentz quantum numbers of the
elds. in the case that  = zzk, one nds a gauge group u (n )k and matter in various
bifundamental representations determined by the details of the geometrical action of .

if the chan-paton factors sit in a regular representation of , then the quiver theory de-

scribes dp-branes that can all move o the orbifold xed point. in the case of a non-regular

representation, there are fractional branes stuck at the xed point, which at least in some

cases have been seen to be equivalent to higher dimensional d-branes wrapped around a

collapsed cycle implicit in the singularity.

we will consider the following supersymmetry-breaking model in some detail. we will
take a d1-brane transverse to c/zz3  c3. the zz3 acts on the four complex coordinates
(x1, x2, x3, x4) transverse to the d1-brane by

(x1, x2, x3, x4)  (e2i( 2

3 )x1, x2, x3, x4).

(2.1)

the unorbifolded d1-brane has a gauge group u (3n ) with fermions and scalars in the
adjoint representation. left-moving fermions 
so(8) rotation group transverse to the branes, and right-moving fermions  

l,  = 1, . . . , 8 transform in the 8s of the
r,  = 1, . . . , 8
transform in the 8c of that so(8). breaking up the eight real left-moving fermions into four

complex fermions, one nds that the action (2.1) rotates them by e

2i

3 , and similarly for

3

the right-movers. this means in particular that the orbifold breaks all the supersymmetry.
the action on the scalars (x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4), whose eigenvalues parameterize the position
of the brane on the transverse c4, is as indicated in (2.1).

projecting onto invariant states (taking the regular representation for the action on
the chan-paton indices), on nds the following spectrum. the gauge group is u (n )3.
the components of x 2, x 3, and x 4 that are invariant under the orbifold transform in the
adjoint of u (n )3. x 1 and the fermions l, r transform in the (n, n, 1) + (1, n, n) +
(n , 1, n ) representation. the quiver diagram for this theory [9] is shown in figure 1.

the interactions of the theory are those of the unorbifolded n = 8 theory which
involve worldvolume elds invariant under the orbifold. the diagonal u (1) in the u (n )3
gauge group is totally decoupled (nothing is charged under it). there are two relative

u (1) factors which couple. the lagrangian includes theta-terms ir fi where fi are

the eld strengths of the three u (1) factors. we will analyze the symmetry structure of

the theory arising from these interactions (choosing particularly symmetric values for the
quiver theory couplings) in studying their renormalization-group ow in 3.

2.2. d1d5

we will also briey consider supersymmetry-breaking theories involving both d1-

branes and d5-branes. let us consider a c/zz3 orbifold transverse to the d1d5 system,

taking the regular representation for the action of the orbifold group on both the d1-branes

and the d5-branes. (otherwise the (15) and (51)-sector strings would be projected out

by the orbifold action.) this involves considering 3 sets of q1 d1-branes and 3 sets of

q5 d5-branes. before orbifolding, the (11) sector strings are as described in the previ-

ous subsection, and the (15) and (51) strings form hypermultiplets in the (3q1, 3q5)
representation of the u (3q1)  u (3q5) symmetry group of the d1-branes and d5-branes.
after orbifolding, we obtain:

the position of d1-branes on d5-branes. h and h are hypermultiplet

elds coming from the (15) and (51) strings.

2.3. asymmetric orbifolds

we will nd in some sense more positive results for the case of d-branes on certain

asymmetric orbifold backgrounds [16]. in this subsection we briey review what we will

need about their worldvolume theories [22]. consider an asymmetric orbifold involving an
action by (1, 1)4(1)fr (that is, a zz2 reection of the left-moving coordinates and no
action on the right-moving coordinates on the string worldsheet). this is a symmetry of
t 4 compactication at the so(8)-symmetric point in narain moduli space, and is a basic

ingredient in the models considered in [16].

this action maps d1-branes transverse to the t 4 into d5-branes wrapped on it, and

therefore is only a symmetry if we take q1 = q5 in the unorbifolded theory. the orbifold

action then acts o-diagonally on (a natural basis of) the open-string hilbert space. strings

from the (11) sector map to (55) strings, (15) to (51). this means that if we start with
a (11) sector string state |i11, it will automatically combine with a (55) string state
|gi55 (where g denotes the result of acting with the orbifold group on the worldsheet
modes ) to form an invariant linear combination |i11 +|gi55. this will be signicant
later.

3. general features

in this section we will assemble information on the target space, symmetries, and

operator content of the quiver gauge theories. this will provide strong evidence for a

(possibly ne-tuned) ow from the quiver yang-mills theories for particular values of the
in particular in 3.1 we
will determine the appropriate values of the -parameters corresponding to the orbifold

parameters to orbifold conformal eld theory in the infrared.

conformal eld theory.

3.1. interactions and symmetries

we are interested in whether the quiver gauge theory obtained on d1-branes on an

orbifold background ows to the corresponding orbifold cft in the infrared. a zzk orbifold

cft has two types of discrete symmetries. the rst is an exchange of the g-twisted sector
with the g1-twisted sector (for all orbifold group elements g) combined with leftright
exchange (parity). let us call this transformation t-parity. the second is the zzk

quantum symmetry [23] which constrains the correlators of twisted sector vertex operators.

6

also, the orbifold conformal eld theory is nonsingular. in supersymmetric contexts, this

requires that the uv yang-mills theory not have a coulomb branch.

for simplicity we will here consider zz3 orbifolds such as the c/zz3 case that is our

main example, but the results of this subsection are more general (and in particular apply

to the supersymmetric cases of [18][17]). if we choose the gauge couplings and matter self-

interactions as inherited from the unorbifolded theory, then these terms respect t-parity

and a zz3 symmetry under which the three u (n ) factors in the gauge group are cyclically

permuted.

let us consider the -parameters in the eld theory. in general these couple via the

terms

l = 1z f1 + 2z f2 + 3z f3

(3.1)

this can be rewritten as (writing  = e

2i

3 )

l = z (

1 + 12 + 3

1 + 2 + 13

3

)(f1 + 1f2 + f3)

(

1 + 2 + 3

3

)(f1 + f2 + f3)

(3.2)

this basis is useful for studying the possible correspondence with orbifold conformal eld

theory because each term here is an eigenstate of the zz3 symmetry which permutes the

three u (1) factors. let us set

we would like to nd the values  can take such that:

(i) there is a zz3 symmetry permuting the three u (1) factors,

(ii) there is a t-parity symmetry, and

(iii) the model has no coulomb branch.

the condition (iii) must be imposed since it ensures that there is a nonzero background

electric eld which contributes positive vacuum energy obstructing the coulomb branch,

as explained for this type of model in [8].

these conditions are solved by

where totftot = ( 1+2+3

3

and 32  2312

3

.

in this basis, the solution (3.6) for  is

(12, 32) = (2/3, 2/3)

(3.8)

this agrees with the results of [17]. this procedure of enforcing t-parity, the quantum

symmetry, and the absence of a coulomb branch of course applies much more generally
than just to the zz3 orbifold of interest here.

we can also consider continuous global symmetries in addition to the discrete sym-

metries we have so far considered. chiral symmetries in particular can provide exact,

non-perturbative constraints on renormalization group ow. as proposed by t hooft [24],

anomaly coecients remain invariant under the renormalization-group ow, and hence
their matching can serve as a useful consistency check. in our c/zz3 example, however, we
nd by studying the surviving interactions in the theory that there are no chiral symme-

tries in the uv with nontrivial t hooft anomalies. this was noted in the case of d1-branes

in at space in [25]. in quiver theories with for example (2,2) supersymmetry, one does

nd chiral symmetries, but they act on scalars which parameterize the target space of

the d1-brane worldvolume theory. these symmetries therefore do not match on to the

r-symmetries in the ane lie algebra of the infrared superconformal eld theory. in our

supersymmetry-breaking example, we do not nd even this type of chiral symmetry. we

therefore cannot use the t hooft anomaly matching condition to constrain the ow. the

absence of such chiral symmetries has implications for matrix string theory as we discuss

further below.

8

3.2. moduli space

let us consider the c/zz3 theory of 2.1. the classical moduli space of the ultraviolet
yang-mills theory on the d1-branes has two branches. one of them, the higgs branch, is

simply the orbifold space

mclass

higgs = (c/zz3  ir6)n /sn

(3.9)

this is true simply by construction; this branch describes the n branes moving around on

the orbifold space we started with.

if the branes coalesce at the singularity, they can separate in the ir6 transverse to the

orbifolded dimensions. this yields a classical coulomb branch of the form

coulomb = (ir6)3n /s3n

mclass

(3.10)

this branch only exists for 12 = 0, 32 = 0.

3.3. operator spectrum and the flow conjecture

let us summarize the situation so far. if we consider the theory at the values of the
 parameters determined in 3.1, then the theory has several features which will be of
interest:

(1) an unbroken t-parity symmetry, and no coulomb branch.

(2) the higgs branch (3.9) is a simple orbifold space.

(3) there is also a zz3 discrete symmetry in the model, acting on operators which are

gauge-invariant in the orbifold but would not have been in the original theory.

these features (1)-(3) are also true of the orbifold conformal eld theory on (c/zz3 

ir6)n /sn :

(1) this is a (nonsingular) symmetric orbifold conformal eld theory, so there is a left-right

exchange symmetry combined with exchange of congugate twisted sectors (t-parity).

(2) the target space is this orbifold space.

(3) the orbifold cft includes twisted sectors that transform under a discrete zz3 quan-

tum symmetry [23] that constrains their correlators.

these features suggest that the ultraviolet yang-mills theory might ow in the infrared

to the corresponding orbifold conformal eld theory. let us consider the operator spectrum

of the two theories.

9

the orbifold cft has relevant operators of the form

eiky + (images under zz3 and sn actions)
1
2

k2 < 1

(3.11)

where y is a coordinate in (c ir6)n . if we consider a compact target space then there is
a nite number of such operators. these operators are not charged under any symmetry

of the theory. if we add them to the lagrangian they appear as contributions to the scalar

potential. being relevant, adding them to the lagrangian drives the theory away from the

orbifold cft xed point.

in the ultraviolet yang-mills theory, there is correspondingly a scalar potential v (y i ),
where y i are gauge-invariant operators parameterizing the classical moduli space. in the

model inherited from the orbifold in string theory, this potential is zero classically. (in
the quantum eld theory one could consider any v (y i ) classically, and we will use this
freedom shortly.) there is an innite number of possible terms in v (y i) that are not

charged under any symmetry of the orbifold theory, which therefore could be generated
under renormalization group ow. since for large |y | the d1-branes separate and only feel
the supersymmetry-breaking through stretched strings of mass proportional to |y |, the
potential should fall to zero as |y |  .2 in the next section, we will explicitly calculate
quantum corrections in the yang-mills regime and nd that a nontrivial potential v (y i)

is in fact generated at subleading orders in a 1/n expansion.

from (3.11) we see that only a subset of these terms become relevant operators from

the point of view of the ir orbifold conformal eld theory.

it is therefore possible to

adjust parameters in the uv yang-mills lagrangian to cancel o the contributions that

will become relevant in the infrared. in the case of the noncompact target space (3.9), this

set of relevant perturbations, though a subset of the perturbations that can be considered

in the yang-mills theory, is still a continuous innity of perturbations, and the ne-tuning

we are discussing would need to be applied to an innite number of coecients. this can

be avoided by compactifying the target space.

one could also generate corrections to the metric on the target space (3.9). in the
orbifold cft such corrections, which can be fourier-expanded to the form y y eiky , are

2 one nds that logarithmic terms do not arise because of cancellations in the planar diagrams

reviewed below.

10

all irrelevant. therefore these terms do not need to be ne-tuned away in order to ow to

the orbifold conformal eld theory.

in the orbifold cft, there are relevant operators in the zz3 twisted sectors. these
are charged under the zz3 quantum symmetry of the orbifold, which, as mentioned above,
exists also in the uv yang-mills theory for  given by (3.6). in the uv theory the operators

charged under the zz3 symmetry cannot be generated under rg ow.

there are other symmetries of the orbifold cft that are not mirrored in the gauge

theory. the orbifold cft has a (2,2) superconformal algebra. this algebra includes

left and right-moving u (1)r symmetries under which some operators (twist elds) have

fractional charges, so that there is no spacetime supersymmetry. there is no such chiral
symmetry in the yang-mills quiver theories, as we discussed in 3.1.

despite the appearance of an accidental supersymmetry algebra in the ir which

has no counterpart in the uv yang-mills theory, there are many features that do agree

between the two theories. the identication of the targets space, discrete symmetries, and

untwisted relevant perturbations suggests strongly that the quiver yang-mills theory is

ne-tunable to ow to the corresponding orbifold cft in the infrared.

3.4. applications to string theory and gravity

given a well-dened (if ne-tuned) ow from the yang-mills theory to the orbifold

cft, it is intriguing to consider whether it denes an interesting gravity dual. at least

naively, one can ne-tune the boundary conditions in (an orbifold of) the gravity solution of

[3] to obtain an ultraviolet lagrangian with the right values of the couplings to ow to the

orbifold cft. it will be interesting to try to work this out. similarly we can consider the

question of whether this ow denes a matrix string theory which formulates a spacetime
string theory away from its gs  0 limit.

another interesting application is the following.

if we consider the n = 1 theory,
the orbifold cft lives simply on c/zz3  ir6, and constitutes a cft that could appear
on the worldsheet of a perturbative string. in this context, the relevant operator in the

twisted sector is a vertex operator for a twisted-sector tachyon in spacetime. this is a

twist eld, an operator nonlocal with respect to the elementary degrees of freedom of the

orbifold sigma model. in the uv yang-mills theory, the corresponding operator (whatever

it is) is a simple gauge-invariant combination of elementary elds in the yang-mills theory.

examples of twisted operators in the yang-mills theory include relative gauge couplings

(3.13)

(analogues of relative d terms in supersymmetric theories). here the subscripts denote the
components of x 1 involved via their charges under the u (1)3 gauge symmetry. it would be

very nice to identify the operator that corresponds to the vertex operators for the twisted

sector tachyons, since the eect of adding them to the lagrangian might be clearer in the

yang-mills theory. in particular, we might get information on how much central charge

is lost upon turning on the relevant deformation corresponding to tachyon condensation

[26]; this type of tachyon (localized at xed points of an orbifold) was not covered by the

techniques in [27], where other types of closed string tachyons were analyzed.

the absence of the u (1)r chiral symmetry in the uv theory has implications for

matrix string theory (with any amount of supersymmetry). one might have hoped to nd
that the worldsheet supersymmetry of the infrared gs  0 conformal eld theory would
extend to the full gs 6= 0 matrix string theory.
in the infrared this symmetry is made
manifest by bosonizing the green-schwarz variables and re-fermionizing them to obtain the

rns description of the superstring where worldsheet supersymmetry is apparent. given a

chiral u (1) current in the uv with the right properties to match onto the u (1)r symmetry

of the ir superconformal algebra, one might have been able to bosonize that current away

from criticality and nd some sort of rns formulation of the matrix string theory. this

does not seem possible for the quiver theories (or the parent theory of d1-branes in at

space); it would be interesting to nd backgrounds for which such chiral symmetries would

appear on the worldvolume of d1-branes.

4. diagrammatics

in this section we perform explicit calculations to check whether the terms of the form
v (|y |) are in fact generated under rg ow in the yang-mills regime (gy m small) of the
quiver theory. after reviewing the fact that they are not generated by planar diagrams,

we show that they are generated by nonplanar diagrams. by way of contrast, we show
that in the asymmetric orbifold case of 2.3, such terms are not generated at the order we
compute. for simplicity in this section we will work with the n = 1 theory of a single

d1-brane on the orbifold background.

12

4.1. planar diagrams

the quiver quantum eld theory has a dual description in terms of an orbifold of the

gravity solution of [3], which acts on the sphere surrounding the branes but not on the

radial coordinate [5]. in the worldsheet string theory describing this gravity background,

correlation functions of untwisted vertex operators are inherited from those of the unorb-

ifolded theory. this ensures that the correlation functions of untwisted operators in the

gauge theory are similarly inherited, if the correspondence is correct (as explained for the

-functions in [5]). this result can be seen directly to all orders in perturbation theory by

an analysis of the eld theory diagrams [12].

so for example in the case of the 1-loop contributions to the scalar mass squared for

x 1 in the c/zz3 quiver theory, one nds the following graphs:

x 1

x 1

x 1

(ii)

figure 3: planar 1-loop feynman diagrams contributing to the x 1 mass

term in the c/zz3 quiver theory.

the diagram (i) with bosons running in the loop cancels against a diagram (ii) with

fermions running in the loop; although the fermions are not superpartners of the bosons

they come in the right multiplicities to cancel and the lorentz structure of the diagrams

are the same as appears in the supersymmetric theory.

4.2. non-planar diagrams

let us rst consider non-planar contributions to the scalar potential on the coulomb

branch. let us calculate the mass squared of the modes describing the relative motion of
the branes in the x 2,3,4 directions. at one-loop the relevant diagrams are

this includes nonplanar contributions. the zero-external-momentum piece of this

diagram does not cancel. this can be seen from the fact that there is an excess of fermions

running in the loop as compared to the balance of fermions and bosons in corresponding

diagrams in a supersymmetric theory.

on the higgs branch the relevant quantity to compute is the scalar potential for x 1.
here there are no non-planar contributions at one loop. at two loops we nd nonplanar

diagrams of the form

would cancel against those in figure 5. here  denotes gauginos.

these fermions running in the loops of these diagrams include adjoint fermions (gauginos

in a supersymmetric theory). evaluating these superpartner diagrams, we nd for the

rst one

k2q2 + m2q  k

(q2 + m2)q2(k2 + m2)k2(q  k)2

tr((k/ + m)q/(q/ + m)k/)

(q2 + m2)q2(k2 + m2)k2(q  k)2

for the second one we nd

= (igy m )4z d2qd2k

tr((k/ + m)q/(k/ + m)k/)
q2(k2 + m2)2k2(q  k)2
(k  q)(k2 + m2)

(k2 + m2)2k2q2(q  k)2

(4.1)

(4.2)

here the mass m for the gauginos is proportional to gy m , where  is the distance of the

d1-brane from the orbifold xed point. let us consider the integrands of these diagrams.

we nd, upon introducing feynman parameters, an expression that separates into a piece

that integrates to zero plus a piece whose integrand is of denite sign that cannot cancel.
to begin with the k  q terms in (4.1)(4.2) are of indenite sign. introducing feynman
parameters, one obtains an integrand of the form

d((q)2, k2)(cid:19)5
(cid:18) f (k2, m2)

k  (q + ak)

(4.3)

for each of these contributions. here the denominator d is a positive (indenite) function
of (q)2 and k2, where q is equal to q  ak for a positive quantity a (which is a function
of feynman parameters); f (k2, m2) is a positive function of k2 and m2. given this, the
k  q term in the numerator integrates to zero since the integrand is odd in q and k. the
other term ak2 has a positive integrand. these surviving contributions to the integrand
from the k  q terms have the same sign as the other terms in (4.1) and (4.2).

since the surviving integrand here is of denite sign, the contribution of the super-

partner graphs is nonzero, independent of the precise infrared regularization scheme that

we might introduce, as long as that scheme respects lorentz invariance. (so this result

would hold for example if we introduce masses to regularize the infrared divergences.)

this above non-cancellation of 1/n corrections to the d1 worldvolume theory will

occur for generic nonsupersymmetric quiver theories. the simplest way to see this is to

note that the absence of adjoint fermions (which would run in the loops of (4.1) and (4.2)) is

a direct consequence of the fact that the orbifold action projects out all spacetime spinors.

given a nontrivial action on the spinor quantum numbers of the worldvolume fermions,

the surviving representations are necessarily bifundamental rather than adjoint.

4.3. asymmetric orbifolds

this is not the case for the asymmetric orbifolds reviewed briey in 2.3. for these
theories, the invariant states of the form |i11 + |gi55 include adjoint fermions. their
interactions are also such that the superpartner diagrams (4.1)(4.2) are present in the

theory, in addition to the bosonic diagrams that they cancel. as such, at this order in

the asymmetric orbifold background, the moduli space on the d-brane worldvolume is
stable under quantum corrections. these diagrams are suppressed by a factor of 1/n 2

relative to the leading order contributions. this cancellation is in accord with the 1-loop

15

cancellation of the cosmological constant in this background [16] through ads/cft duality

as explained in [5]. it would be very interesting to see where the cancellations break down

(if at all) from the point of view of the d-brane worldvolume theories. in particular, the

spacetime theorys 2-loop cancellation in the cosmological constant (according to a rather

subtle calculation in [16]) suggests that these cancellations might persist at least to order
1/n 4 in the d-brane theories.3

5. singular cfts

as discussed above, for  = 0 a new (coulomb) branch opens up in the target space

of the yang-mills theory.

in supersymmetric situations, the existence of this branch is

stable against quantum corrections (although its geometry is subject to corrections). as

rst explained in the context of calabi-yau compactication in [8], these branches lead to

singularities in correlation functions arising from integration over the bosonic zero modes

parameterizing this branch [30]. in the application to worldsheet string theory, these singu-

larities in the infrared cft describe spacetime backgrounds of string theory in which light

non-perturbative states appear (and resolve the singularities in the correlation functions).

in particular in compactications of type ii string theory to six dimensions on k3, one

nds non-perturbatively enhanced non-abelian gauge symmetry at points in moduli space

where the geometry is an orbifold space (an ade singularity) and the integrals rci

the ns 2-form b over the collapsed 2-cycles ci of the ade singularity vanish [19]. the

b of

quantum-mechanical explanation of the singularity is dierent in dierent supersymmetry

classes [31]. it is interesting to consider whether this kind of phenomenon arises also in

non-supersymmetric string backgrounds.

3 this two-loop cancellation is based on the rather subtle formalism of integration over split
rns supermoduli space at genus two, evaluated in a particular gauge with separate analysis of

the cancellation of boundary contributions. a recent work [28] objecting to this conclusion for

a subset of these theories includes a not-yet-complete calculation in a dierent gauge, and (as

far as we understand) an invalid objection to a determinant factor in the measure of the integral

over supermoduli space included in the calculation of [16].

independent tests of the result of

the calculation in [16] (and therefore of the formalism involved) will involve integration over the

moduli space of the diagram; such tests might be most tractable near boundaries of the moduli

space [29].

16

in generic non-supersymmetric orbifold conformal eld theory (for example on the

c/zz3 background we have been considering) one does not expect exactly marginal oper-

ators like r b of the above example. let us instead consider an orbifold conformal eld
theory on the product space c/zz3 c2/zz2. the second factor alone preserves supersym-

metry and does have exactly marginal operator in the zz2 twisted sector corresponding

to r b. this exactly marginal operator is trivially present in the product as well, and
when r b  0 the correlation functions of the full theory (in particular those involving

zz3-invariant, zz3-untwisted operators) diverge as in the supersymmetric theory.

this singularity in the non-supersymmetric worldsheet conformal eld theory as

r b  0 will not cancel upon considering condensation of the zz3-sector tachyon and

higher-loop eects. it suggests the presence of light states in the theory not described by

fundamental strings. it would be interesting to understand the resolution of this singular-

ity in the spacetime theory. given such non-supersymmetric backgrounds not described by

perturbative string theory, it would be interesting to understand the contributions these

new light states make to quantum eects in these backgrounds.

we can construct the quiver theory corresponding to this product orbifold cft. one

nds a u (1)6 gauge group and matter content given by the following quiver diagrams:

figure 7: c/zz3 c2/zz2 quiver diagrams. + () collectively denote the
spinors with +1(1) eigenvalues under the zz2 action on c2.

note that in the yang-mills theory, all degrees of freedom mix with each other and

there is no product structure. in the quiver theory there is a branch of classical moduli

space in which fractional branes separate at the zz2 xed point, when the relative  angle
zz2 of the zz2 part of the quiver theory vanishes.

when the  angles of the uv theory satisfy the discrete symmetry constraints of 3.1,
the theory can be ne-tuned to ow to the orbifold cft on c/zz3  c2/zz2. it would be
interesting to understand whether this feature persists as we take zz2 to zero (in particular

one would like to know how much ne-tuning is required as a function of zz2 ). if it persists,

then one could study the singularity via the coulomb branch of the yang-mills theory as

in other cases.

in [21], the singular cft in (4,4) supersymmetric theories was studied, and an eective

description in terms of a wzw model times a linear dilaton was obtained far down the

throat of the target space. as in the case of orbifold conformal eld theory, this type of

18

cft exists (and is exactly solvable) with arbitrary amounts of supersymmetry. it would

be interesting to nd examples of theories with broken supersymmetry where this type of

throat theory emerges.

unlike in the case of orbifold cft, the wzw times linear dilaton part of the singular

cft describes only a piece of the target space, which must be matched on to the rest of

the target space in a manner which is consistent with conformal invariance. one might

hope to access conformally invariant theories of this type by arriving at them via marginal

deformation from an understood conformal eld theory, such as orbifold conformal eld

theory. indeed, in the supersymmetric context one nds a ow pattern of the following

form:

uv

sym
 = 

sym
 = 0

non-singular

cft

marginal

throat  cft
(singular)

figure 8: an expected ow pattern in the presence of supersymmetry.

for example, in the d1-d5 system with q1 = 1 and q5 = 2, the higgs branch moduli
space is ir4/zz2  ir4. there are four exactly marginal perturbations involving the twist
elds for the zz2 action.
in the d1-d5-system with a transverse c/zz3 orbifold action
described in 2.2 (for q1 = 1, q5 = 2), we nd a higgs branch moduli space

m = (ir4/zz2)3  ir4

(5.1)

unfortunately in this case, we nd that the ir4/zz2 twist elds have dimension greater than
1 (and are therefore irrelevant). this arises because there are more fermions transforming

19

under the relevant zz2 factor in the yang-mills gauge group than in the corresponding
supersymmetric theory. so here we cannot deform toward a singular cft using a marginal

operator, since none presents itself. it would be very interesting to understand whether

nonetheless the  = 0 yang-mills theory ows to a nontrivial (singular) cft in the ir

directly, perhaps with ne-tuning.
