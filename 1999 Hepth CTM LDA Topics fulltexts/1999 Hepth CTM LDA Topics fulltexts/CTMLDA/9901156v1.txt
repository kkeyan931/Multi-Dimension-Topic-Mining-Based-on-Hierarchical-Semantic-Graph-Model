abstract

the quantum eective theory of general relativity, independent of the even-
tual full theory at high energy, expresses graviton-graviton scattering at one

loop order o(cid:0)e4(cid:1) with only one parameter, newtons constant. dunbar and

norridge have calculated the one loop amplitude using string based techniques.
we complete the calculation by showing that the 1
d4 divergence which remains
in their result comes from the infrared sector and that the cross section is nite
and model independent when the usual bremsstrahlung diagrams are included.

1 introduction

the simplest low energy process in quantum gravity is graviton-graviton scattering.

although experimentally unobservable, this reaction forms an interesting theoretical

laboratory that illustrates the workings of quantum gravity. if general relativity is

the correct low energy classical theory of gravity, then its quantum theory forms an

eective eld theory capable of analyzing the low energy quantum eects. graviton-

graviton scattering is particularly useful in illustrating the logic of predictions in a

quantum eective theory. indeed, at one loop order this reaction provides a model-

independent quantum prediction of general relativity.

at tree level, the graviton-graviton scattering amplitude is simple in the helicity

basis, although the calculation to obtain this result from the einstein action is not so
simple. with + () representing helicity +2 (2)1, all tree amplitudes for 1+2  3+4
vanish except those related to atree(++; ++) by crossing and [1]

here 2 = 32g and s = (p1 + p2)2, t = (p1  p3)2, u = (p1  p4)2 denote the usual
madelstam variables.

it is simple to show that graviton-graviton scattering should be nite and pa-

rameter independent at one-loop order [2].

in the eective low energy theory [3]

gravitational eects are expanded in a derivative expansion with all terms satisfying

general covariance

sgrav = z d4xg (cid:20) 2

r + c1 r2 + c2 r r + . . . + lmatter(cid:21)

(2)

here 2 = 32g and g is newtons constant, c1,2 are unknown dimensionless param-
eters which contain information about the (presently unknown) ultimate high energy
theory. a third covariant of order r2, rr can be removed in four dimensional
space-time through the use of the bianchi identities. since the curvature involves two

derivatives of the metric, the einstein action (the term with r) is seen to be of order
e2, while r2 and rr are of order e4.

loop diagrams obey a power-counting theorem [4, 5]. one loop diagrams formed
from vertices given by the einstein action yield eects at order e4  any process

with more loops is higher order in the energy expansion. the ultraviolet divergences

at one loop necessarily have the same structure as the local lagrangian in eqn. (2),
which means that they must be proportional to r2 or r r. then, at this order, the
ultraviolet divergences can be absorbed into renormalized values of the the parameters

c1,2. these renormalized constants are unknown and will be dierent depending on
the nature of the theory that forms the ultimate correct high energy theory which

includes gravity. in this sense these parameters are model dependent. however, they

do not contribute to the process of graviton-graviton scattering. at the order that we
are working, the r2 lagrangians are applied to form vertices for on-shell amplitudes,
1note that in our notation crossing also requires one to ip the  sign for the aected gravitons.

this implies in particular that a(; ++) must be a symmetric function of s, t and u.

which is to say that the equations of motion are satised for the external states.

however, the equations of motion for the purely gravitational sector are r = 0,
and hence r = 0 also. thus the eects of both of the r2 terms in eqn. (2) vanish in

purely gravitational processes. it is this argument that tells us that graviton-graviton

scattering is nite and independent of any unknown parameters at one loop order.

the power counting theorem is manifest in the one-loop results calculated by

dunbar and norridge [7]. the one-loop amplitude is formed by using the lowest

order tree amplitude twice in order to produce a loop diagram, and hence carries
coupling constants 4  g2
powers of the external energies. this is seen in the results:

n . dimensionally this requires that the result carry four

and all logarithms with negative arguments are understood to have a i imaginary
part. note that this represents a real tour-de-force. done in conventional eld theory,

the calculation is formidably dicult. it is a tribute to the string based techniques

that the results are obtainable with less then herculean eort.

indeed, after cal-

culating the graviton loops, the authors write down the result for massless scalars,

fermions and photons in the loops in just a few lines. however, the result is not tied

3

to the validity of string theory as a fundamental theory  the technique is simply an

ecient way to calculate the results of usual (quantum) general relativity.

one notices that the one loop amplitude in eqn. (3) contains a factor of 1

 , i.e.
it is not nite. at rst, this seems to contradict the general reasoning given above.

however, in the complete calculation of the physical process of graviton scattering,

there will also be bremsstrahlung diagrams describing the radiation of soft gravitons
o the external graviton lines. when calculated in a d = 4  2 dimensional phase
space these infrared eects also bring in a 1
 factor. if the divergence in eqn. (3) is
an infrared divergence, and if the eective eld theory of gravity behaves as a proper

eective eld theory, then the infrared loop eects should be canceled against the soft

radiation. while there are good reasons for believing that the gravitational eective

eld theory should be well behaved in the infrared, the long-standing doubts about

quantum gravity make it worthwhile to check this property in the only complete

calculation available.

in ref. [6] it was shown that the scattering of spin-0 elds

is infrared nite even in the limit when their masses vanish. however, it was only

conjectured there that the same is true for massless matter of higher spin (a situation

similar to graviton-graviton scattering). one also notes that the scale of the logarithm

is not dened. this is an indication that the calculation is incomplete. we will see

that the scale in the logarithm comes from an infrared regulator for soft gravitons.

finally, part of our motivation comes from a minor quibble with the argument given
above. in the eective lagrangian we removed the (r)2 term by the use of an
identity that is only valid in exactly four dimensions. indeed, in any higher dimension

the argument given would not apply, and the graviton scattering amplitude would

contain a model dependent parameter. this means that in the quantum theory we

can only be certain of the result if we use a regularization scheme that works in

four dimensions. however, the only scheme that we know about that preserves the

symmetries of general relativity is dimensional regularization, and it was that scheme

used in ref. [7]. while it is unlikely that the regularization scheme would lead to

an extra divergence, we also want to conrm that the residual divergence is not an

artifact of the ultraviolet regularization.

2 soft gravitons in graviton-graviton scattering

we will explicitly calculate the divergences in the one-loop dierential cross section for

graviton-graviton scattering. we will nd a complete cancellation of infrared diver-
gences when we calculate the cross section up to o(6), including the bremsstrahlung
graphs, as shown in fig. 1.

quantity atree represents the sum of all tree level diagrams. solid lines represent hard
gravitons, wavy lines are soft gravitons.

in this gure we explicitly show all factors of . the rst term in the gure (and

ve additional graphs, not shown, with graviton exchanges between various pairs of

external legs) is already included in the full one-loop scattering calculation and has an

infrared divergence. this divergence is canceled by another divergence in the second

term in the gure, a soft bremsstrahlung process, which should be added as it is

degenerate in energy with pure hard scattering. the second line in the gure shows
that the actual cancellation occurs in the o(6) terms because the leading o(4) is
tree level and infrared nite.

we will derive a general formula for the infrared divergences which uses the on-

shell born amplitude. the most convenient regularization procedure is dimensional

regularization. we calculate the ir divergent part of the graviton radiation term in

fig. 1 and show [cf. eqn. (26)] that to do so we only need to know the on-shell tree
level amplitudesatree(1, 2, 3, 4). we always work in the helicity basis and i = 

5

stands for the helicity of the ith hard graviton. the only divergence occurs when

the gravitons have helicity assignments ++; ++ (and in the cases related to this by

crossing) and that is the only case when the tree level amplitude is nonvanishing. in

the following we show [eqn. (13)] that soft graviton radiation does not ip the hard

graviton spins so that all ir divergences are proportional to the tree amplitude with

the same helicity.

the amplitude with one soft graviton radiation is the sum of the four diagrams

in fig. 2. we rst calculate the contribution from 2(a)

at this point we make a comment on how dimensional regularization works. in
 divergence in dimensional regularization. as
pure gravity is one-loop nite and all the divergences in one-loop graviton-graviton
scattering come from the pure gravity part only, all of this 1
 should be of infrared
origin and consequently be canceled by the square of the amplitude arad. however,

8

arad itself is a tree level amplitude which does not diverge; the canceling 1
 factor
comes from the phase space integral. one might wonder then why we are not getting
too much divergence: the leading term is 1
k2 , so the phase space integral introduces

z dd1k

k k2

(19)

which is logarithmically divergent. in the same time the angular integration is also

divergent and we nd that dimensional regularization does not handle correctly an

integral of the type

nite, although the integral includes a severe collinear singularity. fortunately, in

our case, we will not encounter this problem: the spins conspire so that there is an

additional angular factor which takes away all collinear singularities in this integral.

in other models, however, like one with elementary massless scalars, this might be a

problem which requires further treatment.

now we calculate the dierential cross section in d = 4  2 dimensions. we
focus on the infrared region only, integrating up to a cuto   s and neglecting

momenta of order  and above. such soft graviton radiation should (and will) be

sucient to cancel the ir divergences due to one-loop integrals. in particular, we do

not consider hard collinear gravitons. the divergences due to hard collinear graviton

radiation (i.e. when one of the is is small) are not canceled by loops. however, these

divergences are all proportional to  so can be unambiguously separated from the

soft divergences. some rather tedious algebra leads to an integral over the direction

the k integral has a 1
 infrared divergence. all divergences that are collinear and
infrared simultaneously should come from the second integral. however, we observe

that the numerator in the angular integral vanishes when the denominator does,

actually canceling out the singularity. this fact is necessary to allow us to consistently

separate collinear divergences from soft ones. in order to nd the divergent part, we

3 conclusions

this has been the rst explicit investigation of the infrared properties of a one loop

amplitude in quantum gravity. we have achieved our goal in demonstrating that

the eective theory of gravitation is not plagued by infrared divergences, its soft

divergences even cancel in the case of one-loop graviton-graviton scattering, and also

11

demonstrated that, similarly to the case of qed, summation over degenerate states

in the nal state suces to get a nal and sensible cross section.

the result for graviton-graviton scattering to one-loop order is beautiful and sig-

nicant because it forms a low energy theorem for quantum gravity. no matter what

the high energy theory of gravity may turn out to be, and independent of the mas-

sive particles in the theory, as long as the low energy limit leads to general relativity

the scattering rate must have the model independent form shown in eqn (29). as

expected, the quantum eective eld theory of general relativity is well-behaved in

the infrared.
