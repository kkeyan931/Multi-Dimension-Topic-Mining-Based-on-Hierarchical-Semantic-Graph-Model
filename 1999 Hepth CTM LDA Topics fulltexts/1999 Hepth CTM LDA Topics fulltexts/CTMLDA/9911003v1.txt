abstract

this thesis aims to make precise the microscopic understanding of hawking radiation from

the d1/d5 black hole. we present an explict construction of all the shortmultiplets of the
n = (4, 4) scft on the symmetric product t 4/s(q1q5). an investigation of the symmerties
of this scft enables us to make a one-to-one correspondence beween the supergravity

moduli and the marginal opeerators of the scft. we analyse the gauge theory dynamics of

the splitting of the d1/d5 system into subsystems and show that it agrees with supergravity.

we have shown that the xed scalars of the d1/d5 system couple only to (2, 2) operators thus

removing earlier discrepancies between d-brane calculations and semiclassical calculations.

the absorption cross-section of the minimal scalars is determined from rst principles upto

a propotionality constant. we show that the absorption cross-section of the minimal scalars

computed in supergravity and the scft is independent of the moduli.

acknowledgements

firstly, i would like to thank spenta wadia, my thesis advisor for inspiration, support and

encouragement throughout my ve years at tifr. it is from him i learnt how to approach

problems in physics. he has emphasized to me the importance of thinking from rst princi-

ples and attacking physically relevant problems. during my early years in tifr, spentas

guidance helped me overcome the maze of superuous literature and to concentrate on the

basics. he emphasized to me the importance of independent thinking in physics. i thank

him for sharing with me his wonderful ideas. his inspiring condence helped me overcome

moments of despair when all means of attacking a physics problem seemed to fail.

during the course of my ve years i worked very closely with gautam mandal and

avinash dhar. i have learnt (not completely) from gautam the art of reducing a physics

problem to its very essentials.

it is amazing to see how simple a seemingly complicated

problem is, when reformulated by gautam. avinash helped me to realize the importance

of being persistent and pursuing a physics problem to its entire logical conclusion. avinash

and i were closely working on a problem which would not have yielded results had it not

been for the constant encouragement and persistence of avinash.

i owe most of my understanding of gauge theories to the wonderful course that sumit

das took great pains to teach. the course stretched for the entire year of 1995. i thank

the string community in tifr for being active in fostering the nascent enthusiasm for the

subject.

there are other members of the theory group working in dierent elds who provided in-

spiration, help and guidance indirectly and unknowingly. they did it through their lectures,

seminars and discussions. i have benetted in this way from deepak dhar and mustansir

barma.

the students of the theory group during the past ve years contributed a lot to help

me imbibe the spirit of search and discovery. i would like to mention abhishek dhar whose

uncompromising attitude towards physics continues to be a source of inspiration.

i would like to acknowledge the help from the ecient and friendly sta of the department

of theoretical physics.

finally i would like to thank my family and friends for their support in helping me pursue

physics as a career.

introduction

a unied theory of fundamental interactions should include within its framework a quan-

tum theory of gravity. the quantization of einsteins theory of gravity using conventional

methods poses a host of problems. einsteins theory of gravity is a non-renormalizable

eld theory. therefore one can not extract meaningful answers from quantum perturbation

theory. the existence of black holes as solutions in einsteins theory of gravity is another

stumbling block. arguments involving physics of black holes within the framework of quan-

tum mechanics seem to lead to the conclusion that quantum mechanical evolution of black

hole is not unitary. this contradicts the basic rules of quantum mechanics.

at present string theory is the leading candidate for a unied theory of fundamental

interactions. the massless spectrum of string theory includes the graviton. the low energy

eective action of string theory includes the einstein action. string theory is also consistent

with the rules of quantum mechanics. thus the natural generalization of einsteins theory

within the framework of quantum mechanics is string theory. furthermore string theory is

perturbatively nite. this cures the non-renormalizability of gravity. the understanding of

non-perturbative spectra of string theory like d-branes has paved the way for addressing the

problems of black hole physics. in this thesis we will attempt to make precise the description

of black hole physics within the framework of string theory.

1.1 black hole physics

let us briey review some general properties of black holes. [1] black holes are objects which

result as end points of gravitational collapse of matter. for masses greater than 3.6 solar

mass, the gravitational force overcomes all other forces and the matter generically collapses

1

into a black hole (in some exceptional cases a naked singularity might result). this would

suggest that to specify a black hole it is necessary to give in detail the initial conditions of

the collapse. as we will see below a black hole is completely specied by a few parameters

only.

to introduce various concepts related to black hole we will discuss two examples of black

holes. first, let us consider the schwarzschild black hole in 3 + 1 dimensions. it is a time

independent, spherically symmetric solution of pure einstein gravity. its metric is given by

ds2 = (cid:18)1 

2gn m

r

(cid:19) dt2 +(cid:18)1 

2gn m

r

(cid:19)1

dr2 + r2d2

(1.1)

where t refers to time, r the radial distance,  the solid angle in 3 dimensions and gn the

newtons constant. we have chosen units so that the velocity of light, c = 1. the surface

r = 2gn m is called the event horizon. it is a co-ordinate singularity but not a curvature

singularity. light-like geodesics and time-like geodesics starting at r < 2gn m end up at

r = 0 (the curvature singularity) in nite proper time. this means that classically the black

hole is truly black, it cannot emit anything. note that the solution is completely specied

by only one parameter m, the mass of the black hole.

next we consider the reissner-nordstrom black hole. it is a time independent, spherically

symmetric solution of einstein gravity coupled to the electromagnetic eld. the solution is

given by the following backgrounds.

ds2 =  1 

2gn m

r

gn q2

r2 ! dt2 + 1 

+

2gn m

r

gn q2

r2 !1

+

dr2 + r2d2, (1.2)

a0 =

q
r

.

where a0 is the time component of the vector potential. this solution carries a charge q.

there are two co-ordinate singularities at

and

the event horizon is at r = r+. when m = |q|/gn , the outer horizon at r = r+ and the
inner horizon at r = r coincide. a black hole with coincident inner and outer horizons is

n m 2  gn q2

n m 2  gn q2

(1.3)

(1.4)

r+ = gn m +qg2
r = gn m qg2

2

called an extremal black hole. note that in this case the black hole is completely specied

by its mass m and the charge q.

in general, collapsing matter results in black holes which are completely specied by the

mass m, the u(1) charges qi and the angular momentum j. this is called the no hair

theorem. whatever other information (for example, multipole moments) present decays ex-

ponentially fast during the collapse. thus, all detailed information carried by the collapsing

matter is completely lost.

so far we have discussed the black holes only classically.

in the seventies, the works

of bekenstein, hawking and others furthered the understanding of black holes within the

framework of quantum mechanics. it was found by hawking that the schwarzschild black

hole is not truly black. a semi-classical calculation by hawking showed that it emits radiation

with the spectrum of a black body at a temperature t given by

t =

h

8gn m

(1.5)

the quantum nature of this eect is clearly evident from the fact that the temperature

is proportional to h. for the reissner-nordstrom black hole the temperature of hawking

radiation is

t =

(r+  r)h

4r2
+

(1.6)

one notes that the extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole does not hawking radiate. in

general the hawking temperature turns out to be function of mass, the charges and the

angular momentum alone. thus even semi-classical eects do not provide further information

of the black hole. the works in the seventies culminated in the following laws of black holes

which are analogous to the laws of thermodynamics.

i. first law: two neighboring black hole equilibrium states are related by

dm = t d(cid:20) a

4gn h(cid:21) + idqi + dj

(1.7)

where a is the area of the event horizon,  the electric surface potential and  the angular

velocity. for the special case of the reissner-nordstrom black hole the rst law reduces to

dm = t d(cid:20) a

4gn h(cid:21) + dq.

3

(1.8)

where  = q/r+.

ii. second law: black holes have entropy s given by

s =

a

4gn h

(1.9)

in any irreversible process, the sum of the entropy of the black hole and the surroundings

always increases.

the above facts taken together lead to the following puzzle. consider a black hole formed

out of the collapse of a pure state. it eventually evaporates through hawking radiation. the

radiation is purely thermal. the nal state is a mixed state. thus we have a situation in

which a pure state has evolved into a mixed state. this contradicts the unitary evolution of

quantum mechanics.

to emphasize where we lack in understanding let us contrast the above situation with that

of radiation from a black body. a black body made up of a pure state radiates thermally.

this is because we have averaged over the various micro-states of the black body. the

radiation would contain sucient information to reconstruct the pure state of the black

body. in this case we do not have a contradiction with quantum mechanics.

the diculty with the understanding of black holes within the framework of quantum

mechanics is because we do not know what are the microstates which contribute to the

entropy of the black hole. any serious candidate for the quantum theory of gravity should

enable us to understand black holes from a microscopic point of view.

it should provide

us with a microscopic theory analogous to the way statistical mechanics is the microscopic

theory for thermodynamics. string theory has demonstrated the potential to fulll this

requirement.

1.2 black holes in string theory

the low energy eective action of string theory has black holes as solutions of its equation

of motion. based on earlier suggestions [2, 3, 4, 5] an attempt was made to understand the

entropy of black holes in string theory. [6, 7] showed that the microscopic states contributing

to the entropy of certain black holes in string theory arises due to the degeneracy of the

4

perturbative string spectrum. for bosonic string theory it was seen [6] that a very massive
string with mass m at strong string coupling gs has a schwarzschild radius, rschwarzschild 
s m larger than the string length  and therefore can be treated as a black hole. the
g2

entropy of states of the perturbative string for a given mass level can be computed as

follows. one evaluates the degeneracy of the string states at a given mass. the logarithm

of this degeneracy is the entropy of the string states at that mass level. for a perturbative

string of mass m, the entropy is proportional to m. but it is well known that the entropy

of a schwarzschild black hole is proportional to m 2.

it was hoped that strong coupling

eects would renormalize the mass of the string so that the entropy of the string could

agree with that of the corresponding black hole.

if one has a situation where mass does

not get renormalized then the entropy evaluated at weak coupling should agree with that

calculated at strong coupling. in superstring theory there are states whose masses are not

renormalized. these are the bps states. it was shown in [7] that a massive bps string of

heterotic string theory compactied on t 6 has an entropy due to perturbative string states

which is proportional to the area of the stretched horizon. the supergravity conguration

corresponding to this bps string has a horizon of zero area. thus it was necessary to nd a

black hole solution in string theory which is bps and has nite area of horizon. such black

holes are known, but they carry ramond-ramond charges. they are solitonic solutions

of the supergravity equations of motion.

it was not until the discovery of the carriers

of these charges known as d-branes [8] and their understanding in terms of perturbative

string theory that a microscopic understanding of black holes developed. strominger and

vafa in [9] calculated the entropy of an extremal and bps black hole of type iib string
theory compactied on k3  s1. this extremal black hole was obtained by wrapping d5-
branes along the 4-cycle of k3 and introducing momentum along the s1. strominger and

vafa showed that the entropy calculated as the logarithm of the degeneracy of states in

the microscopic theory corresponding to the extremal black hole agrees precisely with that

computed from supergravity.

5

1.3 the d1/d5 black hole

a black hole solution which is bps and has a nite area of horizon was also studied by
callan and maldacena [10]. it is a solution of type iib string theory compactied on t 4 s1
to ve dimensions. this solution avoids the complication of having to deal with k3. this

black hole will be the working model in this thesis 1. we will discuss the solution in detail

below.

the relevant terms in the supergravity action for the solution are

b denotes the ramond-ramond two form potential,  the dilaton and g the metric. to con-

struct the supergravity solution, we take q5 d5-branes and align them along the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

directions and q1 d1-branes along the x5 direction. we then compactify the 6, 7, 8, 9 direc-

tions on a torus t 4 of volume v4 and the x5 direction on a circle of radius r5. to obtain a

black hole with nonzero area for its event horizon we must introduce n units of momentum

along the x5 direction. the supergravity solution in 10 dimensions for this conguration is

obtained by setting all the other elds of type iib supergravity to zero and setting the elds

in the action to the following values.

the entropy of the 5 dimensional black hole is given by

this solution preserves 4 supersymmetries out of the 32 supersymmetries of type iib theory.

it is a bps conguration.

a non-extremal version of the above black hole solution can be obtained by having

kaluza-klein momentum n which is distributed along the left and right directions of x5.

this breaks all the 32 supersymmetries. such a solution in ten dimensions is given by the

),

(1.16)

(1.17)

we will now discuss the various limits in which physics of this black hole solution can be

understood [12]. as the supergravity action has a 1/g2
s prefactor the classical limit can be
obtained by setting gs  0. the elds are held xed in the classical limit. from (1.14) and
(1.15) we see that this is equivalent to

with gsq1, gsq5, g2

gs  0,
s n xed.

the formulae in (1.15) indicate that this is also equivalent to

gs  0,
with r1, r5, rn xed.

(1.18)

(1.19)

where rn = r0 sinh . hawkings semi-classical analysis of the radiation emitted by the black

hole is valid in this limit.

the d1/d5 black hole is a solution of the equations of motion of type iib supergravity.

type iib supergravity is the low energy eective theory of type iib string theory. therefore

the classical limit (1.18) is described by genus zero closed string theory. in string theory for

every genus there is an  expansion. closed string perturbation is valid when the typical
length scales involved are large compared to the string length . from (1.14) we nd the
typical length scales involved are r1, r5, rn . thus the  expansion is valid when r1, r5, rn

are large compared to string length. from (1.15) this is equivalent to

gsq1 >> 1, gsq5 >> 1, g2

s n >> 1

(1.20)

8

the d1/d5 black hole can also be described by the constituent d-branes. d-brane

perturbation theory involves open string loops. open string loops have factors of gsq1 or

gsq5, corresponding to the fact that the open string loops can end on any of the d-branes.

hence the classical limit (1.18) corresponds to a large n limit of the open string eld theory.

perturbation theory of the large n limit of open string theory is good if

gsq1 << 1, gsq5 << 1, g2

s n << 1.

(1.21)

in the limit (1.21) the classical solution is still a black hole, though the typical size of

this solution in the limit (1.21) is smaller than the string length. this is because in the

classical limit (1.18) the entropy s in (1.16) diverges.it costs an innite amount of entropy

for the black hole to loose any nite fraction of its mass in outgoing radiation. the second

law thus prohibits radiation from escaping and black holes are black in the classical limit

(1.21), independent of their size. the microscopic understanding of the d1/d5 black hole

involves understanding the d1/d5 black hole in terms of the constituent d-branes. thus any

calculation of a macroscopic property of the black hole like entropy or hawking radiation in

terms of the d-branes is valid only in the small black hole region. surprisingly many of the

calculations done in the limit (1.21) agree with those done in the limit (1.20). the reason is

generally ascribed to some non-renormalization theorems.

the entropy of the extremal and the near extremal black hole discussed above was derived

in [13] using a phenomenologically motivated microscopic model. it consists of a string wound

along the x5 direction. the string was assumed to carry the eective degrees of freedom of

the d1/d5 black hole. the length of the string is q1q5r5. the string is assumed to have

oscillation only along the directions of the torus t 4. it has four bosonic and four fermionic

degrees of freedom. for an extremal black hole with n units of kaluza-klein momentum

along x5 the string is excited to a level nq1q5. this is necessary because of the quantization
of the kaluza-klein momentum in units of 1/r5. the value of l0 l0 of the string is identied
with the kaluza-klein momentum of the black hole. thus we have

l0  l0 =

nq1q5
q1q5r5

=

n

using cardys formula,

sstring = 2qnq1q5

(1.23)

this agrees with (1.13) obtained from the supergravity solution. we will call this phe-

nomenological model the long string model.

hawking radiation of scalars from the near-extremal black hole was understood micro-

scopically from the long string model in [14, 15]. to derive hawking radiation it was necessary

to couple the microscopic model to various elds of supergravity. in [14, 15] this was done us-

ing couplings derived from a dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action of the long string. this method

gave results which agreed with supergravity for minimal scalars. these scalars are massless

in the black hole geometry. a detailed calculation by [12] showed that using the long string

as the microscopic theory for the d1/d5 black hole reproduces the hawking rate taking into

account of the grey body factors of the supergravity. the hawking rate with grey body

factor and the decay rate using the long string is given by

the right movers of the string are excited to a level nr and the left movers of the string are

excited to a level nl.

inspite of these achievements the long string model had many short commings. as we

will see the long string model could explain hawking radiation of those minimal scalars

which correspond to the metric uctuation of the torus t 4. in the supergravity background

of the d1/d5 black hole there are four additional minimal scalars discussed in chapter 2

and chapter 3. the long string model has no way of explaining hawking radiation of these

additional minimal scalars. the long string model failed to reproduce the hawking rate

expected in supergravity for the xed scalars [16]. these scalars are massive in the black

hole geometry. this suggests that the long string model along with the dbi couplings could

10

not be a microscopic model for the d1/d5 black hole. in some ways the model has an ad-hoc

nature. it does not expain why the string has to be of length q1q5r5. the dbi action is

valid only for a single set of branes. its use for the case of multiple d1, d5-branes is at best

a crude approximation.

the rst attempt to obtain a microscopic model for the d1/d5 black hole based on the

low energy eective theory of the d1/d5 system was made in [17]. it was found that the

low energy eective degrees of freedom turn out to be that of a eective string. the fact

that the kaluza-klein momenta has to be quantized in units of 1/(r5q1q5) was explained

by constructing the eective string from the infrared gauge invariant degrees of freedom of

the d1/d5 gauge theory. however using the methods of [17] it was dicult to obtain the

couplings of the eective theory with the supergravity.

1.4 outline of the thesis

in this thesis we attempt to make precise the microscopic derivation of hawking radiation

for the d1/d5 black hole. abstracting from the discussion in the last paragraphs of the

previous section, the requirements for understanding hawking radiation are: 1. discovering

the microscopic degrees of freedom responsible for the black hole entropy. 2. deriving how

these degrees of freedom couple with the elds present in the bulk of the space-time. 3.

explaining the process of the interaction of the bulk elds with the microscopic degrees of

freedom to produce hawking radiation within a unitary framework.

the outline of this thesis is as follows. in chapter 2, we discuss the microscopic degrees

of freedom relevant for the d1/d5 black hole. the microscopic degrees of freedom are best

described by rst isolating the degrees of freedom for a system closely related to the d1/d5

black hole. this system is obtained by type iib theory compactied on t 4 with q5 d5-

branes wrapped on t 4. the compact directions are x6, x7, x8, x9. the single non-compact

direction of the d5-branes is chosen to be along the x5 direction. the q1 d1-branes are

also aligned along the x5 direction. the dierence between the d1/d5 black hole and this

system is that the x5 direction is not compact in the latter. the supergravity solution is

that of a black string in six dimensions. this solution lifted to ten dimensions is given by

11

setting n = 0 in (1.11). we will call this system the d1/d5 system.

we will study the d1/d5 system from the d-brane point of view. as we have seen before

this is valid in the limit (1.21). size. for understanding hawking radiation, it is sucient

to study the low energy eective theory of the d1/d5 system. the low energy theory of

the d1/d5 system is a 1 + 1 dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group
u(q1)  u(q5). it has eight supersymmetries. the matter content of this theory consists
of hypermultiplets transforming in the adjoint representation of each of the gauge groups
and hypermultiplets transforming as bifundamentals of u(q1)  u(q5). we will review in
detail the eld content of this theory and its symmetries. the bound state of the d1 and

d5-branes is described by the higgs branch of this theory. the higgs branch in the infrared
will ow to a certain n = (4, 4) superconformal eld theory (scft). the d1-branes bound
to the d5-branes can be considered as instanton strings of the u(q5) gauge theory. from

this point of view the target space of the scft is the moduli space of q1 instantons of a

u(q5) gauge theory on t 4. this moduli space is known to be a resolution of the orbifold
( t 4)q1q5/s(q1q5) which we shall denote by m. t 4 can be distinct from the compactication
torus t 4. the evidence for this is mainly topological and is related to dualities which map

the black string corresponding to d1/d5 system to a perturbative string of type iib theory

with q1 units of momentum and q5 units of winding along the x5 direction. we will discuss

in detail a realization of this orbifold scft as a free eld theory with identications. the

symmetries of this scft including a new so(4) algebra will also be discussed.

in this thesis we will use the higgs branch of the d1/d5 system, realized as a n = (4, 4)
scft on a resolution of the orbifold m, to provide a microscopic understanding of hawking
radiation from the d1/d5 black hole. the point of view adopted in this thesis is to attempt

at a rst priciple derivation of hawking radiation from the higgs branch of the d1/d5

system. the long string model used by [13] is at best a phenomologically motivated theory.

the complete specication of the d1/d5 system involves the specication of the various

supergravity moduli. the supergravity solution (1.11) is the solution with no moduli. we

would like to understand what the scft is corresponding to the d1/d5 system at generic
values of the moduli. to this end we construct all the marginal operators of the n = (4, 4)

12

scft on m including operators involving twist eld which correspond to blowing up modes.
we classify the marginal operators according to the short multiplets of the global part of
the n = (4, 4) superalgebra and a new so(4) algebra. it is known from supergravity that
the d1/d5 bound state (q1, q5) with no moduli turned on is marginally stable with respect
to decay to subsystems (q1, q5) and (q1, q5). analyzing the gauge theory of the d1/d5

system we nd that the dynamics of this splitting is described by an eective (4, 4) u(1)

theory coupled to q1q5 + q1q5 hypermultiplets. we show, by an analysis of the d-term

equations and the potential, that the splitting is possible only when the fayet-iliopoulos

terms and the theta term of the eective gauge theory are zero [18].

in chapter 3, we take the next step towards the microscopic understanding of hawking

radiation. we nd the precise coupling of the elds of the supergravity to the microscopic
scft. this is given by a specic scft operator o(z, z), which couples to the supergravity
eld  in the form of an interaction

sint = z d2z (z, z)o(z, z)

(1.26)

where  is the strength of the coupling. as the n = (4, 4) scft on m is an eective
theory of the d1/d5 system, it is dicult to x the coupling of this theory to the supergravity

elds. traditionally couplings in eective theories have been xed using the method of

symmetries. for example, the pion-nucleon coupling in the pion model is xed by symmetries.

the pion i transforms as a 3 of the su(2) isospin symmetry. the nucleon n transforms as

a 2 under this su(2). therefore the pion-nucleon coupling consistent with this symmetry is

lint = ge nii5n

(1.27)

where ge is the strength of the pion-nucleon coupling. the operator n i5n transforms as

3 under the isospin su(2). the 5 occurs because the pion is a pseudoscalar. the strength

of the pion-nucleon coupling gef f can be xed only be appealing to the qcd, the microscopic

theory relevant for the pion-nucleon system. in this thesis we x the operator in the scft

corresponding to the supergravity eld using the method of symmetries. it is seen that in the

near horizon limit the d1/d5 system exhibits enhanced symmetries. this is a special case

of the ads/cft correspondence. the near horizon geometry of the d1/d5 system reduces

13

to that of ads3  s3  t 4. the ads/cft correspondence [19] states that string theory on
ads3  s3  t 4 is dual to the 1 + 1 dimensional scft describing the higgs branch of the
d1/d5 system on t 4. the radius of s3 is 2(g2
s q1q5/v4)1/4. the kaluza-klein modes
on t 4 is of the order of the string length. thus for large q1q5, type iib string theory on
ads3  s3  t 4 passes over to 6 dimensional (2, 2) supergravity on ads3  s3. we will work
in the supergravity limit. the evidence for this correspondence comes from symmetries.

the isometries of ads3 correspond to the global part of the virasoro group of the scft.

the r-symmetry of the scft is identied with the isometry of the s3. the number of

supersymmetries of the bulk get enhanced to 16 from 8. these correspond to the global
supersymmetries of the n = (4, 4) superalgebra of the scft. thus the global part of the
superalgebra of the scft is identied with the ads3s3 supergroup, su(1, 1|2)su(1, 1|2).
therefore a viable strategy to x the coupling is to classify both the bulk elds and the

scft operators according to the symmetries. the question then would be if this procedure

can x the scft operator required for analysing hawking radiation. we will review the

classication of the entire set of kaluza-klein modes of the six-dimensional supergravity on
s3 as short multiplets of su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) [20]. we use symmetries, including a new
global so(4) algebra, to identify the marginal operators constructed in chapter 2 with their

corresponding supergravity elds. this enables us to identify the operators corresponding

to the minimal scalars. we show that the four of the minimal scalars which are not metric
uctuations of t 4 correspond to the blow up modes of the orbifold ( t 4)q1q5/s(q1q5). the

long string model has no operators corresponding to these minimal scalars because it is not

based on an orbifold. therefore it cannot be the eective theory for the d1/d5 system. we

also nd the representation of the operators of the xed scalars under the shortmultiplet
of the supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) [18, 21]. we show that the scft operators cor-
responding to the all the xed scalars have conformal dimension (h, h) = (2, 2). the long

string along with the dbi action predicts that the xed scalars also couple to operators with

dimension (1, 3) and (3, 1). hawking radiation computed from the long string model using

(1, 3) and (3, 1) operators gave results which did not agree with that computed from super-

gravity. operators of dimension (2, 2) gave results which agreed with supergravity. thus

14

this method of xing the coupling removes the discrepancy found earlier for the xed scalars

using the long string model.

in chapter 4 we will see that the hawking rate/absorption

cross-section is determined upto a proportionality constant by the dimension of the scft

operator corresponding to the supergravity eld. thus for the case of the xed scalars we

have detemined the hawking rate upto a normalization constant. this constant can be de-

termined by the same methods used for the case of the minimal scalars discussed in chapter

4. we compare the description of the higgs branch of the eective u(1) gauge theory de-

scribing the splitting of (q1, q5) system into subsystems in terms of coulomb variables [11]

with the supergravity description of the splitting. we nd that in both cases the splitting is

described by a linear dilaton theory with the same background charge.

in chapter 4, we nally address the problem of hawking radiation. we discuss the

hawking radiation of various scalars from the d1/d5 black hole. the near horizon geometry
of the d1/d5 black hole is bt z  s3  t 4 [12] where bt z refers to a a black hole in three-
dimensional anti-de sitter space discovered by [22]. the mass mand the angular momentum

j of the bt z black hole is given by

m
2
j
2r

= l0 + l0 =

= l0  l0 =

nr + nl

q1q5
nl  nr
q1q5

(1.28)

where r = 2(g2

sq1q5/v4)1/4, nl and nr are as dened in (1.25). the metric of the

zero mass btz black hole is almost identical to that of ads3 except for the identication

of x5 with x5 + 2r5. this dierence leads to killing spinors which are periodic in the x5

coordinate for the bt z black hole and anti-periodic for the ads3. thus the scft dual to

the btz is the ramond sector of the scft of the d1/d5 system whereas ads3 corresponds

to the neveu-schwarz sector. the microscopic degrees of freedom for the d1/d5 extremal
black hole are the states with l0 = n and l0 = 0 in the ramond sector of this scft.

the number of such states agree precisely with the entropy formula (1.13) we argue that
the identication of the operator o corresponding to the minimal and xed scalars carried
out in the neveu-schwarz sector remains valid in the ramond sector of the scft.only non-

extremal black holes can hawking radiate. the general d1/d5 black hole corresponds to a
scft with l0 6= 0 and l0 6= 0 over the ramond vacuum.

15

we calculate hawking radiation of minimal scalars from the d1/d5 black hole using the
n = (4, 4) scft on m. this is done by relating the absorption cross-section of a quanta
to the thermal greens function of the scft operator o which couples to the minimal
scalars. the thermal greens function is determined upto a normalization constant by the
conformal dimensions (h, h) of the operator o corresponding to the minimal scalars. this
method of symmetries makes it possible to derive hawking radiation of the minimal scalars
corresponding to the blow up modes of the orbifold m. in the long string model there is
no way of understanding the hawking radiation of these minimal scalars. this is because

these operators are not present in the action of the long string model. the method of using
thermal greens function of the operator o also makes it clear that upto a normalization
constant one can understand hawking radiation using symmetries.

the precise matching of the hawking rate computed from the microscopic theory and

that computed from supergravity occurs only on xing the strength of the coupling  in

(1.26). since the microscopic theory is an eective theory, the precise value of the coupling

 is dicult to x. we have no rst principle derivation of the strength of the coupling.

(note that even in the pion-nucleon model the strength of the coupling ge could not be

xed by symmetries, one had to appeal to qcd, the microscopic theory relevant for the

pion-nucleon model.) we show that consistency with the ads/cft correspondence xes
the strength so that the hawking rate computed from the scft based on the orbifold m
and supergravity match exactly. a rst principle derivation of the strength of this coupling

from the microscopic theory of the d1/d5 system is still an open problem. to this extent a

complete understanding of hawking radiation is still elusive.

we also investigate the hawking radiation of minimal scalars for the d1/d5 black hole

with moduli turned on. we argue that the entropy of the d1/d5 black holes is independent

of the moduli. we show that both in the supergravity and in the scft the moduli does

not modify the hawking rate [18]. recently the supergravity solutions of the d1/d5 black

hole with moduli were constructed [23]. it would be interesting to verify this prediction for

hawking rate of minimal scalars using the explicit supergravity solution.

it is clear that the method used in this thesis relies only on the symmetry properties

16

of the scft and the near horizon supergravity. the eective scft captures the essential

symmetries required to reproduce the supergravity result. so it is not a surprise that the

scft calculations of hawking radiation done in the limit (1.21) should match with the

supergravity calculations done in the limit (1.20).

the microscopic theory of the
d1/d5 system

in this chapter, we will focus on the microscopic description of the d1/d5 system. we will
describe the general d1/d5 system with moduli in terms of the n = (4, 4) scft on the
resolved orbifold m. we construct all the marginal operators of this scft including the
blow up modes. we will provide an explicit construction of all short multiplets of single
particle states of the n = (4, 4) scft on the orbifold m. we also derive an eective u(1)
gauge theory describing the dynamics of the splitting of the d1/d5 system into subsystem

[1]. we start by reviewing the gauge theory of the d1/d5 system in detail.

2.1 the gauge theory of the d1/d5 system

the gauge theory relevant for understanding the low energy degrees of freedom of the d1/d5

system consists of the massless open string excitations attached to the various d-branes [2, 3].

consider the q1 d1-branes and the q5 d5-branes of type iib string theory in ten-dimensions

arranged as follows. the d5-branes are extended along the directions x5, x6, x7, x8, x9 and

the d1-branes are aligned along the x5 direction. let us call the open strings joining the

d1-branes among themselves as (1, 1) strings and the strings joining the d5-branes among

themselves as (5, 5) strings. the strings joining the d1-branes and the d5-branes are called

(1, 5) strings or (5, 1) strings according to their orientations. the boundary conditions of

the various open strings at both ends along the various co-ordinates can be read o from the

20

following table.

co-ordinate
x0 x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9
q1 d1-branes n d d d d n d d d d
q5 d5-branes n d d d d n n n n n

(2.1)

here d stands for dirichlet boundary conditions and n stands for neumann boundary

conditions. the directions x6, x7, x8, x9 are compactied on a torus t 4.

to nd the low energy degrees of freedom let us rst us look at the symmetries preserved

by this conguration of d-branes. the so(1, 9) symmetry of ten-dimensions is broken down
to so(1, 1)  so(4)e  so(4)i by the boundary conditions. the so(4)e stands for rota-
tions of the 1, 2, 3, 4 directions and the so(4)i stands for rotations of the 6, 7, 8, 9 directions.

as the 6, 7, 8, 9 directions are compactied on the torus t 4, the so(4)i symmetry is also

broken. but we can still use the so(4)i algebra to classify states and organize elds. this

conguration preserves eight supersymmetries out of the 32 supersymmetries of the type

iib string theory. therefore the massless excitations of the various open strings can be

organized into elds of n = 2 supersymmetry in four-dimensions. since the size of the t 4

is of the order of string length we can ignore the massive kaluza-klein modes on the t 4.

therefore the low energy eective theory of the d1/d5 system is a 1 + 1 eld theory with

eight supersymmetries. we will discuss the eld content of this theory as obtained from the

various strings joining the d-branes.

(1, 1) strings

the elds corresponding to the massless excitations of the (1, 1) strings can be obtained

from the dimensional reduction of u(q1) n = 1 super yang-mills in ten-dimensions to two-

dimensions. the bosonic elds of this theory can be organized into the vector multiplet and

the hypermultiplet of n = 2 theory in four-dimensions as

vector multiplet: a(1)

0 , a(1)
hypermultiplet: y (1)

are gauge elds in the compact directions of the n = 1 super yang-mills in ten-dimensions.

21

they are hermitian q1q1 matrices transforming as adjoints of u(q1). the hypermultiplet
of n = 2 supersymmetry are doublets of the su(2)r symmetry of the theory. the y (1)s

can be arranged as doublets under su(2)r as

(2.3)

(5, 5) strings

the eld content of these massless open strings is similar to the the (1, 1) strings except for

the fact that the gauge group is u(q5) instead of u(q1). normally one would have expected

the gauge theory of the (5, 5) strings to be a dimensional reduction of n = 1 u(q5) super

yang-mills to 5 + 1 dimensions. since we are ignoring the kaluza-klein modes on t 4 this is

eectively a theory in 1 + 1 dimensions. the vector multiplets and the hypermultiplets are

given by

vector multiplet: a(5)

0 , a(5)
hypermultiplet: y (5)

they are hermitian q5q5 matrices transforming as adjoints of u(q5). the hypermultiplets

(1, 5) and (5, 1) strings

from (2.1) we nd that these strings have nd boundary conditions along 6, 7, 8, 9 direc-

tions. these boundary conditions imply that the world sheet bosons x6, x7, x8, x9 of the open

string have anti-periodic boundary conditions and the world sheet fermions 6, 7, 8, 9 are

22

periodic in the neveu-schwarz sector. it can be shown that the net zero point energy of the

neveu-schwarz sector vanishes. thus the massless mode is a boson transforming as a spinor

of so(4)i. this gives 22 number of bosons. the gso projection projects out half of these

which reduces the number of bosons to 2. the two bosons of the (1, 5) strings and the

(5, 1) strings combine to form a complex doublet transforming under the diagonal su(2) of

the so(4)i. as the hypermultiplets of n = 2 theory transform as doublets under su(2)r,

the diagonal su(2) of so(4)i can be identied with the su(2)r of the gauge theory. the

chan-paton factors show that they transform as bi-fundamentals of u(q1) and u(q5). we

arrange these hypermultiplets as doublets of the su(2)r symmetry of the theory as

ab =  aab
ab !

b

(2.6)

as an aside we note that the fermionic superpartners of these hypermultiplets which arise

from the ramond sector of the massless excitations of (1, 5) and (5, 1) strings carry spinorial

indices under so(4)e and they are singlets under so(4)i.

therefore the gauge theory of the d1/d5 system is a 1+1 dimensional (4, 4) supersymmet-
ric gauge theory with gauge group u(q1)u(q5). the matter content of this theory consists
of hypermultiplets y (1)s, y (5)s transforming as adjoints of u(q1) and u(q5) respectively.
it also has the hypermultiplets s which transform as bi-fundamentals of u(q1)  u(q5).
we will now show that this gauge theory has the required degrees of freedom to describe

the entropy of the extremal d1/d5 black hole. the d1/d5 bound state is described by the

higgs branch of this gauge theory. the higgs branch is obtained by giving expectation values

to the hypers. this makes the vector multiplets massive. for a supersymmetric vacuum the

hypers take values over the surface which is given by setting the superpotential of the gauge

theory to zero. setting the superpotential to zero imposes two sets of d-atness conditions

corresponding to each of the gauge groups u(q1) and u(q5). the d-terms for the gauge

group u(q1) is given by

aabaab  bbabba + [n (1)

1 , n (1)1

]aa = 0

(2.7)

]aa  [n (1)
aabbba + [n (1)

2 , n (1)2
1 , n (1)

2 ]aa = 0

23

while the d-terms of the gauge group u(q5) are

aabaab  bbabba + [n (5)

1 , n (5)1

]bb = 0

(2.8)

]bb  [n (5)
aabbba + [n (5)

2 , n (5)2
1 , n (5)

2 ]bb = 0

where a runs from 1, . . . , q1 and b runs from 1, . . . , q5.

the total number of bosonic degrees of freedom from all the hypermultiplets is

4q2

1 + 4q2

5 + 4q1q5

(2.9)

the rst equation in (2.7) is real and the second equation in (2.7) is complex. the total

number of constraints imposed by (2.7) is 3q2

1. similarly the set of d-term equations in (2.8)

imposes 3q2

5 constraints. equations (2.7) and (2.8) have the same trace parts corresponding

to the vainishing of u(1) d-terms, namely,

aabaab  bbabba = 0
aabbab = 0

(2.10)

1 + q2

another q2

which are three real equations. therefore, the vanishing of d-terms imposes 3q2

5  3
constraints on the elds. one can use the gauge symmetry u(q1) and u(q5) to remove
5  1 degrees of freedom. the number of degrees of freedom xed by the
gauge symmetry is less than the number of generators of u(q1) and u(q5) by one. this
is because all the hypermultiplets are invariant under the diagonal u(1) of u(q1)  u(q5).
after gauge xing, the number of gauge invariant bosonic degrees of freedom to parameterize

1 + 3q2

the moduli space is 4(q1q5 + 1).

we are interested in low energy black hole processes so it is sucient to study the scft
of the higgs branch. the scft will have n = (4, 4) susy with central charge 6(q1q5 + 1)
on a target space m. to nd the microstates corresponding to the extremal d1/d5 black
hole we look for states with l0 = n and l0 = 0. the assymptotic number of distinct states

of this scft given by cardys formula

 = exp(2qq1q5n )

24

(2.11)

from the boltzmann formula one obtains

s = 2qq1q5n

(2.12)

this exactly reproduces the bekenstein-hawking entropy (1.13) of the extremal d1/d5 black

hole.

2.2 the instanton moduli space

in the previous section we found that the higgs branch of the gauge theory of the d1/d5
system ows in the infrared to n = (4, 4) scft on a target space m with central charge
6q1q5. for black hole processes like hawking radiation it is important to know the target
space m. in this section we review the arguments which show that the target space m is a
resolution of the orbifold ( t 4)q1q5/s(q1q5). ( t 4 can be dierent from the compactication
torus t 4.)

the q1 d1-branes can be thought of as q1 instantons in the 5 + 1 dimensional u(q5)

super yang-mills theory of the q5 d5-branes [4]. to see this note that the dbi action of

the d5-branes have a coupling

z d6x c (2)  tr[f (5)  f (5)]

(2.13)

the non-trivial gauge congurations which are independent of x0, x5 and have zero values of
a(5)
0 and a(5)
5 but non-zero values of tr[f (5)  f (5)] act as sources of the ramond-ramond
two-form c (2)
05 . if these gauge eld congurations have to preserve half the supersymmetries

of the d5-brane action they should be self dual. thus they are instanton solutions of four-

dimensional euclidean yang-mills of the 6, 7, 8, 9 directions.

additional evidence for this comes from the fact that the integral property of tr[f (5) 
f (5)] corresponds to the quantization of the d1-branes charge. the action for a q1 instanton

solution is q1/g2

y m . this agrees with the tension of q1 d1-branes, namely q1/gs. if one is

dealing with non-compact d5-branes and d1-branes it is seen that the d-atness conditions

of the d1-brane theory is identical to the adhm construction of q1 instantons of u(q5)

gauge theory [5].

25

from the discussion in the preceding paragraphs we conclude that m the target space of
scft can be thought of as the moduli space of q1 instantons of a u(q5) gauge theory on
t 4. this moduli space is known to be the hilbert scheme of q1q5 points on t 4 [6]. t 4 can
be dierent from the compactication torus t 4. this is a smooth resolution of the singular
orbifold ( t 4)q1q5/s(q1q5). we will provide physically motivated evidence for the fact that
the moduli space of q1 instantons of a u(q5) gauge theory on t 4 is a smooth resolution
of the orbifold ( t 4)q1q5/s(q1q5) using string dualities. the evidence is topological and it
comes from realising that the cohomology of m is the degeneracy of the ground states of
the d1/d5 gauge theory. we can calculate this degeneracy in two ways. one is by explicitly
counting the cohomology of ( t 4)q1q5/s(q1q5) [7]. the second method is to use string

dualities as discussed below. both these methods give identical answers. thus at least at
the level of cohomology we are able to verify that the moduli space is ( t 4)q1q5/s(q1q5).
consider type iib string theory compactied on s1  t 4 with a fundamental string
having q5 units of winding along x6 and q1 units of momentum along x6. on performing

the sequence of dualities st6789st56 we can map the fundamental string to the d1/d5

system (we can de-compactify the x5 direction nally) with q1 d1-branes along x5 and q5

d5-branes along x5, x6, x7, x8, x9 [8]. therefore using this u-duality sequence the bps states

of this fundamental string (that is, states with either purely left moving or right moving

oscillators) maps to ground states of the d1/d5 system. the number of ground states of the
d1/d5 system is given by the dimension of the cohomology of m. from the perturbative
string degeneracy counting the generating function of bps states with left moving oscillator

number nl is given by

xnl=o

d(nl)qnl = 256 

yn=1  1 + qn
1  qn!8

(2.14)

where d(nl) refers to the degeneracy of states with left moving oscillator number nl. the

d1/d5 system is u-dual to the perturbative string with nl = q1q5.

explicit counting of the cohomology of m gives d(q1q5)/256. the factor 256 comes
from quantization of the center of mass coordinate along 1, 2, 3, 4 directions and the 6, 7, 8, 9
directions. the center of mass coordinate is represented by the relative u(1) of u(q1) 
u(q5). therefore the low energy theory of the bound d1/d5 system is a scft on the target

26

space

r4  t 4  ( t 4)q1q5/s(q1q5)

from now on we will suppress the center of mass coordinate and m will denote

( t 4)q1q5/s(q1q5)

here i runs over the ft 4 coordinates 1,2,3,4 and a = 1, 2, . . . , q1q5 labels various copies

of the four-torus. the symmetric group s(q1q5) acts by permuting the copy indices. it

introduces various twisted sectors which we will discuss later. the free eld realization of this
scft has n = (4, 4) superconformal symmetry. to set up our notations and conventions
we review the n = 4 superconformal algebra.
2.3.1 the n = 4 superconformal algebra

the algebra is generated by the stress energy tensor, four supersymmetry currents, and a

local su(2) r symmetry current. the operator product expansions(ope) of the algebra

with central charge c are given by (see for example [9].)

here t (z) is the stress energy tensor, ga(z), gb(z) the su(2) doublet of supersymmetry

generators and j i(z) the su(2) r symmetry current. the s stand for pauli matrices and

the s stand for the complex conjugates of pauli matrices.

in the free eld realization

described below, the above holomorphic currents occur together with their antiholomorphic

counterparts, which we will denote by ej(z), eg(z) and et (z). in particular, the r-parity group
will be denoted by su(2)r  gsu(2)r.
2.3.2 free eld realization of n = (4, 4) scft on the orbifold m
a free eld realization of the n = 4 superconformal algebra with c = 6q1q5 can be con-
structed out of q1q5 copies of four real fermions and bosons. the generators are given

by

2.3.3 the so(4) algebra

in addition to the local r symmetry the free eld realization of the n = 4 superconformal
algebra has additional global symmetries which can be used to classify the states. there are

2 global su(2) symmetries which correspond to the so(4) rotations of the 4 bosons xi. the

corresponding charges are given by

we are interested in studying the states of the n = (4, 4) scft on m. the classication of
the states and their symmetry properties can be analyzed by studying the states of a free eld
realization of a n = (4, 4) scft on r4q1q5/s(q1q5). this is realized by considering the
holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic n = 4 superconformal algebra with c = c = 6q1q5
constructed out of q1q5 copies of four real fermions and bosons. so we have an anti-

holomorphic component for each eld, generator and charges discussed above. these are

labelled by the same symbols used for the holomorphic components but distinguished by a

tilde.

the charges i1, i2 constructed above generate so(4) transformations only on the holo-

morphic bosons xa(z). similarly, we can construct charges ei1, ei2 which generate so(4)
transformations only on the antiholomorphic bosons gxa(z). normally one would expect
these charges to give rise to a global so(4)hol so(4)antihol symmetry. however, the kinetic
term of the bosons in the free eld realization is not invariant under independent holomorphic

and antiholomorphic so(4) rotations. it is easy to see, for example by using the noether

procedure, that there is a residual so(4) symmetry generated by the charges

ji = i1 + ei1

eji = i2 + ei2

(2.29)

we will denote this symmetry as so(4)i = su(2)i  gsu(2)i, where the su(2) factors are
generated by ji, eji. these charges satisfy the property that (a) they correspond to so(4)
transformations of the bosons xa(z, z) = xa(z)+gxa(z) and (b) they fall into representations
of the n = (4, 4) algebra (as can be proved by using the commutation relations (2.27) of the
is). the bosons x(z, z) transform as (2, 2) under su(2)i  gsu(2)i.

2.3.4 the supergroup su (1, 1|2)
the global part of the n = 4 superconformal algebra forms the supergroup su(1, 1|2). let

the above commutation relations form the algebra of the supergroup su(1, 1|2). the global
part of the n = (4, 4) superconformal algebra form the super group su(1, 1|2) su(1, 1|2).
2.4 short multiplets of su (1, 1|2)
the representations of the supergroup su(1, 1|2) are classied according to the conformal
weight and su(2)r quantum number. the highest weight states |hwi = |h, jr, j3
r = jri
satisfy the following properties

j (+)
r |hwi = 0 j (3)

multiplets are generated from the chiral primaries through the action of the raising operators

(2.32)

the short multiplets of the supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) are obtained by the tensor
product of the above multiplet. we denote the short multiplet of su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) as
(2h + 1, 2h + 1)s. these stand for the degeneracy of the bottom component, the top row in

(2.32). the top component of the short multiplet are the states belonging to the last row in

(2.32). the short multiplet (2, 2)s is special, it terminates at the middle row of (2.32). for
this case, the top component is the middle row. these states have h = h = 1 and transform

as (1, 1) of su(2)r  gsu(2)r. there are 4 such states for each (2, 2)s.

2.5 the resolutions of the symmetric product

we would like to discuss d1/d5 systems with various moduli turned on. to do this we will
construct marginal operators of the n = (4, 4) scft on the symmetric product orbifold m.
we will nd the four operators which correspond to resolution of the orbifold singularity.

2.5.1 the untwisted sector

let us rst focus on the operators constructed from the untwisted sector. the operators of

lowest conformal weight are

a(z)

a(z)

1

a(z)e1
2a (z)e1

1

a(z)e2a (z)
2a (z)e2a (z)

(2.33)

where summation over a is implied. these four operators have conformal dimension (h, h) =

(1/2, 1/2) and (j3

r) = (1/2, 1/2) under the r-symmetry su(2)r gsu(2)r. since (h, h) =
r,ej3

32

(j3

r), these operators are chiral primaries and have non-singular operator product expan-

r,ej3
sions (ope) with the supersymmetry currents g1(z), g2(z), eg1(z), eg2(z). these properties

indicate that they belong to the bottom component of the short multiplet (2, 2)s. each of

the four chiral primaries gives rise to four top components of the short multiplet (2, 2)s.
they are given by the leading pole ((z  w)1(z  w)1) in the opes
g2(z)eg1(z)p(w, w)
g1(z)eg1(z)p(w, w)

g2(z)eg2(z)p(w, w)
g1(z)eg2(z)p(w, w)

where p stands for any of the four chiral primaries in (2.33). from the superconformal
algebra it is easily seen that the top components constructed above have weights (1, 1) and

(2.34)

transform as (1, 1) under su(2)r  gsu(2)r. the opes (2.34) can be easily evaluated. we

nd that the 16 top components of the 4(2, 2)s short multiplets are xi
a

xj
a.

we classify the above operators belonging to the top component according to represen-

tations of (a) the so(4)i rotational symmetry of the et 4, (the four torus t 4 breaks this

symmetry but we assume the target space is r4 for the classication of states) (b) r sym-

metry of the scft and (c) the conformal weights. as all of these operators belong to the

top component of (2, 2)s the only property which distinguishes them is the representation

under so(4)i. the quantum numbers of these operators under the various symmetries are

operator
x{i
x[i

a (z) xj}a (z)  1

(2.35)

(1, 1)
(1, 1)
(1, 1)

(1, 1)
(1, 1)

therefore we have 16 marginal operators from the untwisted sector. as these are top compo-
nents they can be added to the free scft as perturbations without violating the n = (4, 4)

2.5.2 z2 twists.

we now construct the marginal operators from the various twisted sectors of the orbifold
scft. the twist elds of the scft on the orbifold m are labeled by the conjugacy classes
of the symmetric group s(q1q5) [10, 11]. the conjugacy classes consist of cyclic groups of

33

various lengths. the various conjugacy classes and the multiplicity in which they occur in

s(q1q5) can be found from the solutions of the equation

x nnn = q1q5

(2.36)

where n is the length of the cycle and nn is the multiplicity of the cycle. consider the
simplest nontrivial conjugacy class which is given by n1 = q1q5  2, n2 = 1 and the rest of
nn = 0. a representative element of this class is

(x1  x2, x2  x1), x3  x3, . . . , xq1q5  xq1q5

(2.37)

here the xas are related to the xas appearing in the action (2.17) by (2.21) in.

to exhibit the singularity of this group action we go over to the following new coordinates

xcm = x1 + x2 and  = x1  x2

(2.38)

under the group action (2.37) xcm is invariant and   . thus the singularity is locally
of the type r4/z2. the bosonic twist operators for this orbifold singularity are given by

following opes [12]

1(z)1(w, w) =

2(z)2(w, w) =

 1(w, w)
(z  w)1/2
 2(w, w)
(z  w)1/2

1(z)1(w, w) =

2(z)2(w, w) =

1(w, w)
(z  w)1/2
2(w, w)
(z  w)1/2

(2.39)

e1(z)1(w, w) = e1(w, w)
e2(z)2(w, w) = e2(w, w)

(z  w)1/2

(z  w)1/2

e1(z)1(w, w) = e 1(w w)
e2(z)2(w, w) = e 2(w, w)

(z  w)1/2

(z  w)1/2

the  s are excited twist operators. the fermionic twists are constructed from bosonized

currents dened by

1(z) = eih 1(z)

1(z) = eih 1(z)

(2.40)

2(z) = eih 2(z)

2(z) = eih 2(z)

where the s, dened as 1  2, are the superpartners of the bosons .

34

from the above we construct the supersymmetric twist elds which act both on fermions

and bosons as follows:

(1, 1) under su(2)i  gsu(2)i and is denoted by t 0. the simplest way of guring out the
(j3,ej3)i quantum numbers in the above table is to note that (a) the -operators of (2.41)

2.5.3 higher twists

we now show that the twist operators corresponding to any other conjugacy class of s(q1q5)
are irrelevant. consider the class with n1 = q1q5  3, n3 = 1 and the rest of nn = 0. a
representative element of this class is

(x1  x2, x2  x3, x3  x1), x4  x4, . . . , xq1q5  xq1q5.

(2.46)

to make the action of this group element transparent we diagonalize the group action as

follows.

(2.47)

where  = exp(2i/3). these new coordinates are identied under the group action (2.46)
1  1, 2  22 and 3  3. these identications are locally characteristic of the
orbifold

r4  r4/  r4/2

36

(2.48)

the dimension of the supersymmetric twist operator which twists the coordinates by a phase

e2ik/n in 2 complex dimensions is h(k, n) = k/n[12]. the twist operator which implements

the action of the group element (2.46) combines the supersymmetric twist operators acting

on 2 and 3 and therefore has total dimension

h = h(1, 3) + h(2, 3) = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1

(2.49)

it is the superpartners of these which could be candidates for the blow up modes. however,

these have weight 3/2, these operators are therefore irrelevant.

for the class n1 = q1q5  k , nk = k and the rest of nn = 0, the total dimension of the

twist operator is

h =

k1xi=1

h(i, k) = (k  1)/2

(2.50)

its superpartner has dimension k/2. now it is easy to see that all conjugacy classes other

than the exchange of 2 elements give rise to irrelevant twist operators. thus the orbifold
m is resolved by the 4 blow up modes corresponding to the conjugacy class represented by
(2.37). we have thus identied the 20 marginal operators of the n = (4, 4) scft on et 4.

they are all top components of the 5(2, 2)s short multiplets. the 5(2, 2)s have 20 operators
of conformal dimensions (h, h) = (1/2, 1/2). these are relevant operators for the scft. it

would be interesting to investigate the role of these relevant operators.

2.6 the chiral primaries of the n = (4, 4) scft on m

in this section we will explictly construct all the chiral primaries corresponding to single
particle states of the scft on the orbifold m. for this purpose we will have to construct
the twist operator corresponding to the conjugacy class n1 = q1q5  k, nk = k and the rest
of nn = 0.

2.6.1 the k-cycle twist operator

we will extend the method of construction of the 2-cycle twist operator of section 2.5.2

to the construction of the k-cyle twist operator. consider the conjugacy class given by

37

n1 = q1q5  k, nk = k and the rest of nn = 0. a representative element of this class is the
following group action

(x1  x2, . . . , xk  x1), xk+1  xk+1, . . . , xq1q5  xq1q5.

(2.51)

we can diagonalize the group action as follows

(2.53)

these identications are locally characteristic of the orbifold

r4  r4/  r4/2  . . .  r4/k1

(2.54)

the coordinate m is twisted by the phase m ( m runs from 1 . . . k). the bosonic twist

operators corresponding to this twist are dened by the following opes

as in section 2.5.2  s are excited twist operators. the fermionic twists are constructed from

bosonized currents dened by

m(z) = eih 1

m(z) = eih 2

(2.56)

38

where the ms are the superpartners of the bosons ms. the twist operators corresponding

to the fermions ms are given by eimhm/k.

we now assemble all these operators to construct the k-cycle twist operator which is a

chiral primary. the k-cycle twist operator is given by

(k1)/2

(12...k) =

m(z, z)2

m(z, z)eimh 1

k1ym=1h1

m(z)/keimh 2

m(z)/keim h 1

m(z)/keim h 2

(2.57)

m(z)/ki

the subscript (12 . . . k) refers to the fact that these twist operators were constructed for

the representative group element (2.51) which cyclically permutes the 1, . . . , k labels of the
coordinates of t 4. the superscript (k  1)/2 stands for the conformal dimension of this
operator. as we saw in section 2.5.3 the conformal dimension of the twist operator for the
conjugacy class n1 = q1q5k, nk = k and the rest of nn = 0 is (h, h) = ((k1)/2, (k1)/2).
the twist operator for the conjugacy class under consideration is obtained by summing over

the k-cycle twist operators for all representative element of these class.

(k1)/2(z, z) = x{ii,...,ik}

i1i2...ik(z, z)

(2.58)

where the sum runs over all k-tuples {ii . . . , ik} such that ii 6= i2 6= . . . 6= ik. im take values
from 1 to q1q5. the operator (k1)/2 is a chiral primary with conformal dimension (h, h) =
((k  1)/2, (k  1)/2) and (j3
r) = ((k  1)/2, (k  1)/2). as the largest cycle is of length
q1q5, the maximal dimension of the k-cycle twist operator is ((q1q5  1)/2, (q1q5  1)/2).
it belongs to the bottom component of the short multiplet (k, k)s. the other components of

r, j3

the shortmultiplet (k, k)s corresponding to the k-cycle twists can be generated by the action
of supersymmetry currents and the r-symmetry currents of the n = (4, 4) theory on m.

2.6.2 the complete set of chiral primaries

we have seen is section 2.5 there are ve chiral primaries corresponding to the shortmultiplet

5(2, 2)s. in this section we will construct the complet set of chiral primaries from single
particle states of the scft on m. it is known that the chiral primaries with weight (h, h)
of a n = (4, 4) superconformal eld theory on a manifold k correspond to the elements of
the cohomology h2h 2h(k) [13]. the chiral primaries are formed by the product of the chiral
primaries corresponding to the cohomology of the diagonal t 4 denoted by b4 (the sum of

39

all copies of t 4) and the various k-cycle chiral primaries constructed in section 2.6.1. we

will list the chiral primaries below
chiral primaries with h  h = 0

all the k-cyle chiral primaries have h  h = 0. to construct chiral primaries with
h  h = 0 we need the four chiral primaries which correspond to the cohomology h11(b4)
with weight (1/2, 1/2). they are given in (2.33). using this we can construct the following

chiral primaries

(k1)/2(z, z)1

a(z)e1
(k1)/2(z, z)2a (z)e1

a(z)

a(z)

(k1)/2(z, z)1

a(z)e2a (z)
(k1)/2(z, z)2a (z)e2a (z)

(2.59)

where summation over a is implied. these four operators have conformal dimension (k/2, k/2).
there is one more chiral primary corresponding to the cohomology h22(b4) for which
h  h = 0. it is given by

(2.60)

(2.61)

1

a(z)2a (z)e1

a(z)e2a (z)

where summation over all indices of a is implied. this chiral primary corresponds to the top
form of b4. the cohomology h00(b4) gives rise to a chiral primaries of conformal dimension
(k/2, k/2). it is given by

(k2)/2(z, z)1

a(z)2a (z)e1

a(z)e2a (z)

from the equation above we see that these chiral primaries exist only of k  2. finally we
have the chiral primary (k)/2(z, z) of conformal dimension (k/2, k/2). thus for k  2 and
k  q1q5  1 there are 6 chiral primaries of dimension (k/2, k/2)

the complete list of chiral primaries with (h, h) with h  h = 0 corresponding to single

particle states are given by

(h, h)

degeneracy

(1/2, 1/2)
(1, 1)
(3/2, 3/2)

((q1q5  1)/2, (q1q5  1)/2)

(2.62)

in the above table we have ignored the vacuum with weight (h, h) = (0, 0).
chiral primaries with h  h = 1/2

the ciral primaries of b4 which correspond to the elements of the cohomology h10(b4)

are given by

q1q5xa=1

1

a(z) and

q1q5xa=1

2a (z)

(2.63)

we can construct chiral primaries with weight ((k + 1)/2, k/2)) by taking the product of

the above chiral primaries with the twist operator k/2(z, z). these give the following chiral

primaries

k/2(z, z)

q1q5xa=1

1

a(z) and k/2(z, z)

q1q5xa=1

2a (z)

(2.64)

the chiral primary of the diagonal b4 which correspond to the elements of the cohomology
h21(b4) are

here summation over all the three indices of a is implied. from these the one can construct

1

a(z)2a (z)e1

a(z) and 1

a(z)2a (z)e2a (z)

(2.65)

chiral primaries with weight ((k + 1)/2, k/2) are follows

a(z)2a (z)e1

a(z)2a (z)e2a (z)

(k1)/2(z, z)1

a(z) and (k1)/2(z, z)1

(2.66)

therefore there are 4 chiral primaries with weight ((k + 1)/2, k/2) for 1  k  (q1q5  1)
and 2 chiral primaries with weight ((q1q5 + 1)/2, q1q5/2). there are also 2 chiral primaries

with weight (1/2, 0).
chiral primaries with h  h = 1/2

the procedure for constructing these chiral primaries are identical to the case hh = 1/2.

the four chiral primaries with weight (k/2, (k + 1)/2) are given by

(k1)/2(z, z)1

k/2(z, z)

a(z)

q1q5xa=1 e1
a(z)e2a (z)

a(z)e1

k/2(z, z)

q1q5xa=1 e2a (z)
(k1)/2(z, z)2a (z)e1

a(z)e2a (z)

(2.67)

there are 4 chiral primaries with weight (k/2, (k + 1)/2) for 1  k  (q1q5  1) 2 chiral
primaries with weight (q1q5/2, (q1q5 + 1)/2) and 2 chiral primaries with weight (0, 1/2).

41

chiral primaries with h  h = 1

as in the previous cases let us rst look at the chiral primaries corresponding to the

cohomology element h20(b4). there is only one element which is given by

1

a(z)2a (z)

(2.68)

where summation over a is implied. there is a single chiral primary with weight ((k +

2)/2, k/2) constructed out of the above chiral primary is

k/2(z, z)1

a(z)2a (z)

(2.69)

thus there is a one chiral primary with weight ((k + 2)/2, k/2) for 0  k  (q1q5  1)

the operator product expansion of two chiral primaries will give rise to other chiral

primaries consistent with conservation laws. there are known to form a ring.

it will be

interesting to understand the structrure of this ring.
chiral primaries with h  h = 1

the construction of these is parallel to the case for h  h = 1. the single chiral primary

with weight (k/2, (k + 2)/2) for 0  k  (q1q5  1) is given by

k/2(z, z)e1

a(z)e2a (z)

(2.70)

2.7 shortmultiplets of n = (4, 4) scft on m

using the results of section 2.6 we will write the complete set of shortmultiplets of single
particle states of the n = (4, 4) scft onf m. in chapter 3 we will compare this set of short
multiplets with that obtained from supergravity. we will see in chapter 3 that supergravity
is a good approximation in string theory only when q1  , q5  . therefore we write
down the list of shortmultiplets for ( t 4)()/s(). basically this means that the list of chiral
primaries of the previous section 2.6 does not terminate.

we have seen that each chiral primary of weight (h, h) gives rise gives rise to the short

multiplet (2h+1, 2h +1))s. therefore the results of section 2.6 indicate that the list of shor-
multiplets corresponding to the single particle states of n = (4, 4) scft on ( t 4)()/s().

42

is given by

5(2, 2)s + 6 m3 (m, m)s

m2[ (m, m + 2)s + (m + 2, m)s + 4(m, m + 1)s + 4(m + 1, m)s ]

2.8 the location of the symmetric product

the complete specication of the d1/d5 system includes various moduli. most of the studies

of the d1/d5 system so far have been focused on the situation with no moduli. it is known

from supergravity that the d1/d5 system with no moduli turned on is marginally stable

with respect to the decay of a subsystem consisting of q5 d5 and q1 d1-branes. it has been

observed recently [17] that such a decay in fact signals a singularity in the world volume gauge

theory associated with the origin of the higgs branch. the issue of stability in supergravity

in the context of the d1/d5 system has also been discussed in [6, 18].

the singularity mentioned above leads to a singular conformal eld theory and hence

to a breakdown of string perturbation theory. however, generic values of the supergravity

moduli which do not involve fragmentation into constituents are described by well-dened

conformal eld theories and therefore string perturbation theory makes sense. we have seen
in section 2.5 that important singularity structure of the m = (4, 4) scft on the orbifold
m is locally of the type r4/z2. the resolution of this singularity gives rise to marginal
operators. an orbifold theory realized as a free eld scft on r4/z2 is nonsingular as

all correlations fuctions are nite. the reason for this can be understood from the linear

sigma model description of the r4/z2 singluarity discussed in section 2.9.1. we will see

that the though the r4/z2 singularity is geometrically singular the scft is nite because

it corresponds to a non-zero theta term in the linear sigma model. the geometric resolution

of this singularity corresponds to adding fayet-iliopoulos terms to the d-term equations of

the linear sigma model. this deforms the r4/z2 singularity to an eguchi-hansen space. in
the orbifold theory this deformation is caused by the twist operator t 1. the eguchi-hansen
space is asymptotically r4/z2 but the singularity at the origin is blown up to a 2-sphere. one

can use the su(2)r symmetry of the linear sigma model to rotate the three fayet-iliopoulos

43

terms to one term. this term corresponds to the radius of the blown up 2-sphere. the theta

term of the linear sigma model corresponds to b-ux through the 2-sphere. the change of
this b-ux is caused by deforming the orbifold scft by the twist operator t 0. thus scft
realized as a free eld theory on the orbifold r4/z2 is regular even though the 2-sphere

is squashed to zero size because of the non-zero value of b-ux trapped in the squashed

2-sphere [19].

the realization of the scft of the d1/d5 system as n = (4, 4) theory on m implies
that we are at a point in the moduli space of the d1/d5 system at which the orbifold

is geometrically singular but because of the non-zero value of the theta term the scft

is regular and not at the singularity corresponding to fragmentation.

in other words, the

orbifold scft corresponds to a bound state of q1 d1-branes and q5 d5-branes (henceforth
denoted as the (q1, q5) bound state). thus we use the free eld realization of n = (4, 4)
scft on the orbifold m and its resolutions using the marginal operators of this theory to
describe the boundary scft corresponding to the d1/d5 system at generic values of the

moduli.

the symmetric product orbifold m as we have seen before in section 2.2 is the moduli
space of q1 instantons of a u(q5) gauge theory on t 4. we argue that the orbifold m resolved
by the twist operators t 1 is the moduli space of q1 instantons of a u(q5) gauge theory on a
non-commutative torus t 4. we rst look at the case of instantons on r4. the moduli space

of q1 instantons of a u(q5) gauge theory is given by the d-terms of a 1 + 1 dimensional

u(q1) gauge theory with (4, 4) supersymmetry and q5 hypemultiplets. on deforming these

d-term equations by fayet-iliopolous terms we obtain the moduli space of q1 instantons of

a u(q5) gauge theory on a non-commutative r4 [20]. now let us turn to instantons on t 4
the r4/z2 singularity of the orbifold m is resolved by adding fayet-iliopoulos terms to the
d-term equations in the linear sigma model description of the r4/z2 singularity. as we have
seen in the orbifold theory this is caused by adding the twist operators t 1 to the free theory.
the analogy with the case of instantons on r4 gives us the hint that the resolved orbifold m
is the moduli space of q1 instantons of a u(q5) gauge theory on a non-commutative torus

t 4. it will be interesting to make this argument more precise.

2.9 the linear sigma model

in this section we will analyze the gauge theory description of the d1/d5 system. we show

that that the gauge theory has four parameters which control the break up of the (q1, q5)
system to subsystems (q1, q5) and (q1, q5). these are the fayet-iliopoulos d-terms and the

theta term in the eective u(1) (4, 4) linear sigma model of the relative coordinate between

the subsystems (q1, q5) and (q1, q5). to motivate this we will review the linear sigma
model corresponding to the of the r4/z2 singularity.

2.9.1 the linear sigma model description of r4/z2

the linear sigma model is a 1 + 1 dimensional u(1) gauge theory with (4, 4) supersymmetry

[21]. it has 2 hypermultiplets charged under the u(1). the scalar elds of the hypermultiplets

can be organized as doublets under the su(2)r symmetry of the (4, 4) theory as

1 =  a1

b1 ! and 2 =  a2
b2 !

(2.72)

the as have charge +1 and the bs have charge 1 under the u(1). the vector multiplet
has 4 real scalars i, i = 1, . . . , 4. they do not transform under the su(2)r. one can

include 4 parameters in this theory consistent with (4,4) supersymmetry. they are the 3

fayet-iliopoulos terms and the theta term.

let us rst investigate the hypermultiplet moduli space of this theory with the 3 fayet-

iliopoulos terms and the theta term set to zero. the higgs phase of this theory is obtained

by setting i and the d-terms to zero. the d-term equations are

|a1|2 + |a2|2  |b1|2  |b2|2 = 0
a1b1 + a2b2 = 0

(2.73)

the hypermultiplet moduli space is the space of solutions of the above equations modded

out by the u(1) gauge symmetry. counting the number of degrees of freedom indicate that

this space is 4 dimensional. to obtain the explicit form of this space it is convenient to

introduce the following gauge invariant variables

m = a1b2

n = a2b1

(2.74)

45

p = a1b1 = a2b2

(2.75)

these variables are not independent. setting the d-terms equal to zero and modding out

the resulting space by u(1) is equivalent to the equation

p 2 + mn = 0.

(2.76)

this homogeneous equation is an equation of the space r4/z2. to see this the solution of

the above equation can be parameterized by 2 complex numbers (, ) such that

p = i m =  2 n = 2

(2.77)

thus the point (, ) and (,) are the same point in the space of solutions of (2.76).
we have shown that the hypermultiplet moduli space is r4/z2.

the above singularity at the origin of the moduli space is a geometric singularity in the

hypermultiplet moduli space. we now argue that this singularity is a genuine singularity of

the scft that the linear sigma model ows to in the infrared. at the origin of the classical

moduli space the coulomb branch meets the higgs branch. in addition to the potential due

to the d-terms the linear sigma model contains the following term in the superpotential2

v = (|a1|2 + |a2|2 + |b1|2 + |b2|2)(2

1 + 2

2 + 2

3 + 2
4)

(2.78)

thus at the origin of the hypermultiplet moduli space a at direction for the coulomb branch

opens up. the ground state at this point is not normalizable due to the non-compactness of

the coulomb branch. this renders the infrared scft singular.

this singularity can be avoided in two distinct ways. if one turns on the fayet-iliopoulos

d-terms, the d-term equations are modied to [21]

|a1|2 + |a2|2  |b1|2  |b2|2 = r3

a1b1 + a2b2 = r1 + ir2

(2.79)

2these terms can be understood from the coupling aa in six dimensions, and recognizing that
under dimensional reduction to two dimensions is appear from the components of a in the compact
directions.

46

where r1, r2, r3 are the 3 fayet-iliopoulos d-terms transforming as the adjoint of the su(2)r.

now the origin is no more a solution of these equations and the non-compactness of the

coulomb branch is avoided. in this case wave-functions will have compact support all over

the hypermultiplet moduli space. this ensures that the infrared scft is non-singular.

turning on the fayet-iliopoulos d-terms thus correspond to the geometric resolution of the

singularity. the resolved space is known to be [21, 19] described by an eguchi-hanson metric

in which r1,2,3 parameterize a shrinking two-cycle.

the second way to avoid the singularity in the scft is to turn on the theta angle .

this induces a constant electric eld in the vacuum. this electric eld is screened at any

other point than the origin in the hypermultiplet moduli space as the u(1) gauge eld is

massive with a mass proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the hypers. at the

origin the u(1) eld is not screened and thus it contributes to the energy density of the

vacuum. this energy is proportional to 2. thus turning on the theta term lifts the at

directions of the coulomb branch. this ensures that the corresponding infrared scft is well

dened though the hypermultiplet moduli space remains geometrically singular. in terms

of the eguchi-hanson space, the -term corresponds to a ux of the antisymmetric tensor

through the two-cycle mentioned above.

the (4, 4) scft on r4/z2 at the orbifold point is well dened. since the orbifold has a

geometric singularity but the scft is non-singular it must correspond to the linear sigma

model with a nite value of  and the fayet-iliopoulos d-terms set to zero. deformations

of the r4/z2 orbifold by its 4 blow up modes correspond to changes in the fayet-iliopoulos

d-terms and theta term of the linear sigma model3 the global description of the moduli of
a n = (4, 4) scft on a resolved r4/z2 orbifold is provided by the linear sigma model. in
conclusion let us describe this linear sigma model in terms of the gauge theory of d-branes.

the theory described above arises on a single d1-brane in presence of 2 d5-branes. the

singularity at the point r1, r2, r3,  = 0 is due to noncompactness of the at direction of the

coulomb branch. thus it corresponds to the physical situation of the d1-brane leaving the

3if we identify the su (2)r of the linear sigma-model with gsu (2)i of the orbifold scft, then the fayet-

iliopoulos parameters will correspond to t 1 and the -term to t 0. this is consistent with wittens obser-
vation [22] that so(4)e symmetry of the linear sigma-model (one that rotates the is) corresponds to the
su (2)r of the orbifold scft.

d5-branes.

2.9.2 the gauge theory description of the moduli of the d1/d5

system

as we have seen in section 2 the resolutions of the n = (4, 4) scft on m is described by
4 marginal operators which were identied in the last subsection with the fayet-iliopoulos

d-terms and the theta term of the linear sigma model description of the r4/z2 singularity.

we want to now indicate how these four parameters would make their appearance in the

gauge theory description of the full d1/d5 system.

motivated by the d-brane description of the r4/z2 singularity we look for the degrees of

freedom characterizing the break up of (q1, q5) system to (q1, q5) and (q1, q5). physically

the relevant degree of freedom describing this process is the relative coordinate between the

centre of mass of the (q1, q5) system and the (q1, q5). we will describe the eective theory

of this degree of freedom below.

for the bound state (q1, q5) the hypermultiplets the a,b are charged under the relative
 ) t ru (q5)(abb). the

u(1) of u(q1) u(q5), that is under the gauge eld a = t ru (q1)(aaa
gauge multiplet corresponding to the relative u(1) corresponds to the degree of freedom of

the relative coordinate between the centre of mass of the collection of q1 d1-branes and q5

d5-branes. at a generic point of the higgs phase, all the abs have expectation values, thus

making this degree of freedom becomes massive. this is consistent with the fact that we are

looking at the bound state (q1, q5).

consider the break up of the (q1, q5) bound state to the bound states (q1, q5) and
(q1, q5). to nd out the charges of the hypermultiplets under the various u(1), we will

organize the hypers as

ab ab ! , 
  ab ab

i(aa) y (1)
i(aa) y (1)

i(aa)

(2.80)

 and 

i(bb) y (5)

i(bb)



where a, a runs from 1, . . . , q1, b, b from 1, . . . , q5, aa from 1, . . . q1 and b, b from
1 . . . , q5. we organize the scalars of the vector multiplet corresponding to the gauge group

(2.81)

let us call the the u(1) gauge elds (traces) of u(q1), u(q5), u(q1), u(q5) as a1, a5, a1, a5

respectively. we will also use the notation a

  a1  a5 and a

  a1  a5.

as we are interested in the bound states (q1, q5) and (q1, q5), in what follows we will

work with a specic classical background in which we give vevs to the block-diagonal hypers
ab, ab, y (1)

i(bb). these vevs are chosen so that the classical

i(aa) and y (5)

i(bb), y (1)

i(aa), y (5)

background satises the d-term equations [3].

the vevs of the s render the elds a

 massive with a mass proportional to
vevs. in the low energy eective lagrangian these gauge elds can therefore be neglected.
in the following we will focus on the u(1) gauge eld ar = 1/2(a+  a+) which does not
get mass from the above vevs. the gauge multiplet corresponding to ar contains four real

 and a

scalars denoted below by i. these represent the relative coordinate between the centre of
mass of the (q1, q5) and the (q1, q5) bound states. we will be interested in the question

whether the is remain massless or otherwise. the massless case would correspond to a

non-compact coulomb branch and eventual singularity of the scft.

in order to address the above question we need to nd the low energy degrees of freedom

which couple to the gauge multiplet corresponding to ar.

i(bb) and the vector multiplets (1)a a

the elds charged under ar are the hypermultiplets ab, ab, y (1)

i(aa), y (1)
i(bb), y (5)
y (5)
. in order to nd out
which of these are massless, we look at the following terms in the lagrangian of u(q1) 
u(q5) gauge theory:

where the ais run from 1, . . . , q1 and the bis run form 1, . . . , q5. the terms l1 and l2
originate from terms of the type |am |2 where am  (a, i) is the (4, 4) vector multiplet in
two dimensions. the terms l3 and l4 arise from commutators of gauge elds in compactied

directions.

the elds y are in general massive. the reason is that the traces y(1)

i  y (1)

ing the centre-of-mass position in the t 4 of q1 d1-branes, and y(1)
i(a a), representing
the centre-of-mass position in the t 4 of q1 d1-branes, are neutral and will have vevs which

are on top of each other in physical space). the mass of y (1)

and y(5) are the centers of mass of the q5 d5-branes and q5 d5-branes along the direction
of the dual four torus t 4. (at special points when their centres of mass coincide, these elds

thus the relevant degrees of freedom describing the splitting process is a 1+1 dimensional

u(1) gauge theory of ar with (4, 4) supersymmetry. the matter content of this theory

50

consists of hypermultiplets ab with charge +1 and ab with charge 1.

let us now describe the dynamics of the splitting process. this is given by analyzing

the hypermultiplet moduli space of the eective theory described above with the help of the

d-term equations:

aabaab  aa baab  bbabba + bb abba = 0
aabbba  aabbba = 0

(2.85)

in the above equations the sum over a, b, a, b is understood. these equations are general-

ized version of (2.73) discussed for the r4/z2 singularity in section 4.1. at the origin of the

higgs branch where the classical moduli space meets the coulomb branch this linear sigma

model would ow to an infrared conformal eld theory which is singular. the reason for this

is the same as for the r4/z2 case. the linear sigma model contains the following term in

the superpotential

v = (aabaab + aabaab + bbabba + bbabba)(2

1 + 2

2 + 2

3 + 2
4)

(2.86)

as in the discussion of the r4/z2 case, at the origin of the hypermultiplet moduli space the

at direction of the coulomb branch leads to a ground state which is not normalizable. this

singularity can be avoided by deforming the d-term equations by the fayet-iliopoulos terms:

aabaab  aabaab  bbabba + bbabba = r3
aabbba  aabbba = r1 + ir3

(2.87)

we note here that the fayet-iliopoulos terms break the relative u(1) under discussion and

the gauge eld becomes massive. the reason is that the d-terms with the fayet-iliopoulos

do not permit all a, bs in the above equation to simultaneously vanish. at least one of

them must be non-zero. as these a, bs are charged under the u(1), the non-zero of value

of a, b gives mass to the vector multiplet. this can be seen from the potential (2.86). the

scalars of the vector multiplet becomes massive with the mass propotional to the vevs of

a, b. thus the relative u(1) is broken.

the singularity associated with the non-compact coulomb branch can also be avoided

by turning on the  term, the mechanism being similar to the one discussed in the previous

51

subsection.

if any of the 3 fayet-iliopoulos d-terms or the  term is turned on, the at

directions of the coulomb branch are lifted, leading to normalizable ground state is of the

higgs branch. this prevents the breaking up of the (q1, q5) system to subsystems. thus we
see that the 4 parameters which resolve the singularity of the n = (4, 4) scft on m make
their appearance in the gauge theory as the fayet-iliopoulos terms and the theta term.

it would be interesting to extract the singularity structure of the the gauge theory of the

d1/d5 system through mappings similar to (2.74)- (2.77)4.

2.9.3 the case (q1, q5)  (q11, q5)+(1, 0): splitting of 1 d1-brane

it is illuminating to consider the special case in which 1 d1-brane splits o from the bound

state (q1, q5). the eective dynamics is again described in terms of a u(1) gauge theory

associated with the relative separation between the single d1-brane and the bound state
(q1  1, q5). the massless hypermultiplets charged under this u(1) correspond to open
strings joining the single d1-brane with the d5-branes and are denoted by

b =  ab
bb !

(2.88)

the d-term equations, with the fayet-iliopoulos terms, become in this case

abbb = r1 + ir2

(2.89)

1 + 2

2 + 2

3 + 2
4)

(2.90)

while the potential is

q5xb=1(cid:16)|ab|2  |bb|2(cid:17) = r3,
v =

q5xb=1
q5xb=1(cid:16)|ab|2 + |bb|2(cid:17) (2

in this simple case it is easy to see that the presences of the fayet-iliopoulos terms in (2.89)

ensures that all a, bs do not vanish simultaneously. the vevs of a, b gives mass to the s.

thus the relative u(1) is broken when the fayet-iliopoulos term is not zero. the d-term

equations above agree with those in [17] which discusses the splitting of a single d1-brane. it

is important to emphasize that the potential and the d-term equations describe an eective
dynamics in the classical background corresponding to the (q1  1, q5) bound state. this
corresponds to the description in [17] of the splitting process in an ads3 background which

represents a mean eld of the above bound state.

4the singularity structure for a u (1) theory coupled to n hypermultiplets has been obtained in [23]

52

2.9.4 the dynamics of the splitting at the singularity of the higgs

branch

we have seen in section 2.9.2 that the eective theory describing the dynamics of the splitting

of the (q1, q5) system to substems (q1, q5) and (q1, q5) is (4, 4), u(1) super yang-mills
coupled to q1q5 + q5q1) hypermultiplets. the scft which this gauge theory ows in the

infra-red is singular if the fayet-iliopoulos terms and the theta term is set to zero. the

description of the superconformal theory of the higgs branch of a u(1) gauge theory with

(4, 4) supersymmetry and n hypermultiplets near the singularity was recently found in [24].

it was expressed in the coulomb variables. it consists of a bosonic su(2) wess-zumino-
witten model at level n  2, four free fermions and a linear dilaton with background charge
given by

q =s 2

n

(n  1)

(2.91)

the central charge of this scft is 6(n  1). using this result for the u(1) theory describing
the splitting we get a background charge for the linear dilaton given by

q =s

1

q1q5 + q5q1

(q1q5 + q5q1  1)

coupling with the bulk elds

this chapter focuses on nding the coupling of the microscopic theory discussed in chapter
2 with elds of the supergravity. the supergravity eld  couples with the operator o(z, z)
of n = (4, 4) scft on m in the form of an interaction

sint = z d2z (z, z)o(z, z)

(3.1)

 denotes the strength of the coupling. we x the operator o(z, z) corresponding to the
supergravity eld  by appealing to symmetries. we have seen that in chapter 2 the marginal

operators of the scft can be classied according to the quantum numbers of the supergroup
su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) together with the so(4)i quantum numbers.
will see that these symmetries are also present in the near horizon limit of the supergravity

in this chapter we

solution. we will classify the supergravity elds according to these symmetries. in particular

we will focus on all the scalars present in the supergravity background [1]. the coupling in
(3.1) is xed by demanding that the operator o(z, z) and the supergravity eld  have the
same quantum number under the various symmetries [2].

thus the near horizon geometry is that of ads3  s3  t 4. our notation for coordinates
here is as follows: ads3 : (x0, x5, r); s3 : (, , ); t 4 : (x6, x7, x8, x9). r, , ,  are spherical

polar coordinates for the directions x1, x2, x3, x4. the radius of s3 and the anti-de sitter
space is (g2
6q1q5)1/4. let us examine the symmetries of this near horizon geometry.
the bosonic symmetries arise from the isometries of ads3 and s3. the isometries of the

ads3 space form the non-compact group so(2, 2), while the isometries of s3 form the group

so(4)e = su(2)e  gsu(2)e. though the compactication on t 4 breaks the so(4) rota-

tions of the coordinates x6, . . . , x9 we can still use this symmetry to classify supergravity

elds. we will call this symmetry so(4)i. the d1/d5 system preserves eight out of the

32 supersymmetries of the type iib theory.

in the near horizon limit the number of su-

persymmetries gets enhanced from eight to sixteen [4]. these symmetries x the form of

the eective anti-de sitter supergravity theory near the horizon. the bosonic symmetries
so(2, 2) so(4)e = (sl(2r) su(2)) (sl(2, r)  su(2)) form the bosonic symmetries
of the anti-de sitter supergravity in three-dimensions. simple anti-de sitter supergroups in

57

three-dimensions were classied in [5]. it can be seen that the only simple supergroups whose
bosonic part is sl(2, r)  su(2) are osp(3|2, r) and su(1, 1|2). the former contains the
bosonic subgroup o(3)  sl(2, r). the supercharges of the supergroup osp(3|2, r) trans-
form as the vector representation of the group o(3), while the supercharges of the supergroup
su(1, 1|2) transform as 2 of the group su(2). the unbroken supercharges of the d1/d5
system transform in the spinor representation of so(4)e and therefore they transform as 2
of su(2). this rules out osp(3|2, r). therefore the near horizon anti-de sitter supergravity
is based on the supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) with matter elds. the pure anti-de
sitter supergravity based on the super group su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) was constructed in [6]
using the fact that it is a chern-simons theory .

3.2 classication of the supergravity modes

in this section we analyze the spectrum of type iib supergravity compactied on ads3s3
t 4. from (3.5) we see the volume of t 4 is 1642q1/q5. therefore we ignore kaluza-klein
modes on the t 4. the radius of the s3 is (g6q1q5)1/4. this is large when

gsq1 >> 1 and gsq5 >> 1

(3.6)

these inequalities are true in the limit (1.20). therefore we are justied in using supergravity.

kaluza-klein reduction of type iib supergravity to six dimensions leaves six dimensional

(2, 2) supergravity. we show that the kaluza-klein spectrum of the six dimensional theory
on ads3s3 can be completely organized as short multiplets of the supergroup su(1, 1|2)
su(1, 1|2). we will follow the method developed by [7].

the massless spectrum of (2, 2) six-dimensional supergravity consists of: a graviton,

8 gravitinos, 5 two-forms, 16 gauge elds, 40 fermions and 25 scalars. since these are

massless, the physical degrees of freedom fall into various representations r4 of the little

group so(4)l of r(5,1). for example, the graviton transform as a (3, 3) under the little

representation r4 decomposes into various representations r3 of so(3), the local lorentz

group so(4)l = su(2)l  gsu(2)l. on further compactifying r(5,1) into ads3  s3, each
group of the s3. this so(3)  su(2) is the diagonal su(2) of su(2)l  gsu(2)l. for

58

example, the graviton decomposes as 1 + 3 + 5 under the so(3), the local lorentz group

of s3. the dependence of each of these elds on the angles of s3 leads to decomposition in

terms of kaluza-klein modes on the s3 which transforms according to some representation

of the isometry group so(4) of s3. only those representations of so(4) occur in these

decompositions which contain the representation r3 of s3. to be more explicit, consider

the eld rso(3)(x0, x5, r, , , ) which transforms as some representation rso(3) of the local
lorentz group of s3. the kaluza-klein expansion of this eld on s3 is given by

rso(3)(x0, x5, r, , , ) = xrso(4)

rso(4)(x0, x5, r)y

rso(4)
rso(3)

(, , ).

(3.7)

here y

rso(4)
rso(3)

(, , ) stands for the spherical harmonics on s3.

in the above expansion

the only representation of rso(4) allowed are the ones which contain rso(3). for example,

(x0, x5, r, , , ) which is a scalar under the local lorentz group of s3 can be expanded as

(x0, x5, r, , , ) = xm,m; m=m

mm(x0, x5, r)y (m,m)(, , )

(3.8)

once the complete set of kaluza-klein modes are obtained we will organize them into short
multiplets of the supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2).

let us now consider all the massless eld of (2, 2) supergravity in six-dimensions individu-

ally. the graviton transforms as (3, 3) of the little group in 6 dimensions. the kaluza-klein

harmonics of this eld according to the rules discussed above are

(1, 1) + 2(2, 2) + (3, 1) + (1, 3)

(3.9)

+3 m3 (m, m) + 2 m2 [ (m + 2, m) + (m, m + 2) ]

+ m1 [ (m + 4, m) + (m, m + 4) ]

the little group representations of the 8 gravitinos is 4(2, 3) + 4(3, 2). their kaluza-klein

harmonics are

8[ (1, 2) + (2, 1) ] + 16 m2 [ (m + 1, m) + (m, m + 1) ]

(3.10)

+8 m1 [ (m + 3, m) + (m, m + 3) ]

the kaluza-klein harmonics of the 5 two-forms transforming in (1, 3) + (3, 1) of the little

group are

10 m2 (m, m) + 10 m1 [ (m + 2, m) + (m, m + 2) ]

(3.11)

59

the kaluza-klein harmonics of the 16 gauge elds, (2, 2) are

16(1, 1) + 32 m2 (m, m) + 16 m1 [ (m, m + 2) + (m + 2, m) ]

(3.12)

the 40 fermions 20(2, 1) + 20(1, 2) give rise to the following harmonics

40 m1 [ (m, m + 1) + (m + 1, m) ]

the 25 scalars (1, 1) give rise to the harmonics

25 m1 (m, m)

(3.13)

(3.14)

putting all this together the complete kaluza-klein spectrum of type iib on ads3 s3  t 4
yields

42(1, 1) + 69(2, 2) + 48[ (1, 2) + (2, 1) ] + 27[ (1, 3) + (3, 1) ]

(3.15)

70 m3 (m, m) + 56 m2 [ (m, m + 1) + (m + 1, m) ]

+28 m2 [ (m, m + 2) + (m + 2, m) ] + 8 m1 [ (m, m + 3) + (m + 3, m) ]

+ m1 [ (m, m + 4) + (m + 4, m) ]

we now organize the above kaluza-klein modes into short representations of su(1, 1|2) 
su(1, 1|2) [7]. the short multiplet of su(1, 1|2) consists of the following states

j
h

h  1/2
h  1

l0
h

h + 1/2
h + 1

degeneracy

2h + 1
2(2h)
2h  1

(3.16)

in the above table j labels the representation of su(2) which is identied as one of the

su(2)s of the isometry group of s3. l0 denotes the conformal weight of the state. we
denote the short multiplet of su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) as (2h + 1, 2h + 1)s. on organizing
the kaluza-klein spectrum into short multiplets we get the following set

5(2, 2)s + 6 m3 (m, m)s

(3.17)

m2[ (m, m + 2)s + (m + 2, m)s + 4(m, m + 1)s + 4(m + 1, m)s ]

equation (3.15) shows that there are 42(1, 1) so(4) representations in the supergravity

kaluza klein spectrum. we know that one of these arises from the s-wave of g55 from

60

equation (3.9). this is one of the xed scalars. 16(1, 1) comes from the s-waves of the

16 gauge elds (the components along x5) as seen in equation (3.12). the remaining 25

comes from the 25 scalars of the six dimensional theory. we would like to see where these
42(1, 1) t in the short multiplets of su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). from equation (3.17) one
can read that 20 of them are in the 5(2, 2)s with (j = 0, l0 = 1; j = 0, l0 = 1). 6 of

them are in in 6(3, 3)s with (j = 0, l0 = 2; j = 0, l0 = 2). these correspond to the xed

scalars. finally, the remaining 16 of them belong to 4(2, 3)s + 4(3, 2)s. 8 of them have

(j = 0, l0 = 1; j = 0, l0 = 2) and 8 of them have (j = 0, l0 = 2; j = 0, l0 = 1). these

scalars can be recognized as the intermediate scalars.

3.2.1 comparison of supergravity shortmultiplets with scft

in section 2.7 we have listed the complete set of shortmultiplets corresponding to single
particle states of the n = (4, 4) scft on the orbifold m. comparing equation (2.71) and
the list of shortmultiplets of single particle states obtained from supergravity in (3.17) we

nd that they are identical except for the presence of the following additional shortmultiplets

in the scft

2(1, 2)s + 2(2, 1)s + (1, 3)s + (3, 1)s

(3.18)

these correspond to non-propagating degrees of freedom in the supergravity [7]. therefore

they are not present in the list of shortmultiplets obtained form supergravity (3.17).

3.3 the supergravity moduli

in this section we will analyze in detail the massless scalars in the near horizon geometry of

the d1/d5 system. type iib supergravity compactied on t 4 has 25 scalars. there are 10

scalars hij which arise from compactication of the metric. i, j, k . . . stands for the directions

of t 4. there are 6 scalars bij which arise from the neveu-schwarz b-eld and similarly there

are 6 scalars bij from the ramond-ramond b-eld. the remaining 3 scalars are the ten-

dimensional dilaton 10, the ramond-ramond scalar  and the ramond-ramond 4-form
c6789. these scalars parameterize the coset so(5, 5)/(so(5)  so(5)). the near horizon
limit of the d1/d5 system is ads3 s3 t 4 [8]. in this geometry 5 of the 25 scalars become

61

massive. they are the hii (the trace of the metric of t 4 which is proportional to the volume
of t 4), the 3 components of the anti-self dual part of the neveu-schwarz b-eld bij and a

linear combination of the ramond-ramond scalar and the 4-form [9]. the massless scalars
in the near horizon geometry parameterize the coset so(5, 4)/(so(5)  so(4)) [10].

as we have seen the near horizon symmetries form the supergroup su(1, 1|2)su(1, 1|2).
we have classied all the massless supergravity elds of type iib supergravity on ads3 
s3  t 4 ignoring the kaluza-klein modes on t 4 according to the short multiplets of the
supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). the isometries of the anti-de sitter space allow us to
relate the quantum number l0 + l0 to the mass of the scalar eld through the relation.

h + h = 1 + 1 + m2

(3.19)

here m is the mass of the scalar in units of the radius of ads3 and (h, h) is the eigenvalue
of l0, l0 under the classication of the scalar in shortmultiplets of su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2).
thus the massless elds of the near horizon geometry of the d1/d5 system fall into the

top component of the 5(2, 2)s short multiplet. we further classify these elds according to

the representations of the so(4)i, the rotations of the x6, x7, x8, x9 directions. as we have

mentioned before this is not a symmetry of the supergravity as it is compactied on t 4, but

it can be used to classify states. the quantum number of the massless supergravity elds

are listed below.

the linear combination appearing on the fourth line is the one that remains massless in the

near-horizon limit. 6 refers to the six-dimensional dilaton. the su(2)e  gsu(2)e stands

for the so(4) isometries of the s3. all the above elds are s-waves of scalars in the near

horizon geometry.

3.4 ads3/cft2 correspondence

maldacenas conjecture [12, 13, 14, 15] for the case of the d1/d5 system states that string
theory on ads3  s3  t 4 is dual to the 1 + 1 dimensional conformal eld theory of the
higgs branch of gauge theory of the d1/d5 system. there is evidence for this conjecture

from symmetries. to describe the d1/d5 system at a generic point in the moduli space we
can use the n = (4, 4) scft on the orbifold m to describe the higgs branch of the gauge
theory of the d1/d5 system as we have argued in chapter 2. the volume of t 4 is of the

order of string length and radius of s3 is large, therefore we can pass over from string theory
on ads3  s3  t 4 to six-dimensional (2, 2) supergravity on ads3  s3. we will compare
symmetries in the supergravity limit. the identication of the isometries of the near horizon

geometry with that of the symmetries of the scft are given in the following table.

to summarize the su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2) symmetry of the near horizon geometry is
identied with the global part of the n = (4, 4) scft on the orbifold m together with the
identication of the so(4)i algebra of t 4 and t 4.

3.5 supergravity moduli and the marginal operators

we would like to match the twenty supergravity moduli appearing in (3.20) with the twenty

marginal operators appearing in (2.35) and (2.45) by comparing their symmetry properties

under the ads/cft correspondence [11].

the symmetries, or equivalently quantum numbers, to be compared under the ads/cft

63

correspondence are as follows:

(a) the isometries of the supergravity are identied with the global symmetries of

the superconformal eld theory. for the ads3 case the symmetries form the supergroup
su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). the identication of this supergroup with the global part of the
n = (4, 4) superalgebra leads to the following mass-dimension relation

h + h = 1 + 1 + m2

(3.21)

where m is the mass of the bulk eld and (h, h) are the dimensions of the scft operator.

since in our case the scft operators are marginal and the supergravity elds are massless,

the mass-dimension relation is obviously satised.

(b) the su(2)e  gsu(2)e quantum number of the bulk supergravity eld corresponds
to the su(2)r  gsu(2)r quantum number of the boundary operator. by an inspection of

column three of the tables in (2.35), (2.45) and (3.20), we see that these quantum numbers

also match.

(c) the location of the bulk elds and the boundary operators as components of the

short multiplet can be found by the supersymmetry properties of the bulk elds and the

boundary operators. noting the fact that all the twenty bulk elds as well as all the marginal

operators mentioned above correspond to top components of short multiplets, this property

also matches.

(d) the above symmetries alone do not distinguish between the twenty operators or

the twenty bulk elds. to further distinguish these operators and the elds we identify

the so(4)i symmetry of the directions x6, x7, x8, x9 with the so(4)i of the scft. at the

level of classication of states this identication is reasonable though these are not actual

symmetries. using the quantum numbers under this group we obtain the following matching

of the boundary operators and the supergravity moduli.

note that both the representations (1, 3) and (1, 1) occur twice in the above table. this

could give rise to a two-fold ambiguity in identifying either (1, 3) or (1, 1) operators with

their corresponding bulk elds. the way we have resolved it here is as follows. the operators
t 1 and t 0 correspond to blow up modes of the orbifold, and since these are related to the
fayet-iliopoulos terms and the -term in the gauge theory (see section 2.9), tuning these

operators one can reach the singular scft [9] that corresponds to fragmentation of the

d1/d5 system. in supergravity, similarly, it is only the moduli b+

ij and a1 + a2c6789 which

aect the stability of the d1/d5 system [9, 16, 17]. as a result, it is b+
ij ) which
should correspond to the operator t 1 and similarly a1 + a2c6789 should correspond to t 0.
another reason for this identication is as follows. b+
ij and a1 + a2c6789 are odd under

ij (and not b+

world sheet parity while b+
ij and  are even under world sheet parity. assign a z2 quantum
number 1 to the twisted sectors and +1 to the untwisted sectors in the scft. if under
the ads/cft correspondence one can identify these z2 quantum numbers in the boundary

scft and the bulk then the corespondence we have made is further justied.

thus, we arrive at a one-to-one correspondence between operators of the scft and the

supergravity moduli.

3.6 fixed scalars

out of the 25 scalars mentioned earlier which form part of the spectrum of iib supergravity
on t 4, ve become massive when further compactied on ads3  s3. there is an important
additional scalar eld which appears after this compactication: h55. let us remind ourselves

the notation used for the coordinates: ads3 : (x0, x5, r), s3 : (, , ); t 4 : (x6, x7, x8, x9).

r, , ,  are spherical polar coordinates for the directions x1, x2, x3, x4. in terms of the d-

brane wrappings, the d5 branes are wrapped along the directions x5, x6, x7, x8, x9 and d1

branes are aligned along x5. the eld h55 is scalar in the sense that it is a scalar under the

local lorentz group so(3) of s3.

in what follows we will specically consider the three scalars 10, hii and h55. the equa-

tions of motion of these elds in supergravity are coupled and have been discussed in detail
in the literature [18, 19]. it turns out that the six-dimensional dilaton 6 = 10 hii/4 which

65

is a linear combination of hii and 10 remains massless; it is part of the twenty massless (min-

imal) scalars previously discussed. the two other linear combinations  and  are dened

as

 and  satisfy coupled dierential equations. these are examples of xed scalars. the pick

up masses in the background geometry of the d1/d5 system. in the near horizon limit the

equation of motions of  and  become decoupled. they give rise to the massive klein-

gordon equation in ads3. the near horizon mass of  and  is m2 = 8 in units of the radius

of ads3.

understanding the absorption and emission properties of xed scalars is an important

problem, because the d-brane computation and semiclassical black hole calculation of these

properties appear to be at variance [19]. the discrepancy essentially originates from the
expected couplings of  and  to scft operators with (h, h) = (1, 3) and (3, 1). these

scft operators lead to qualitatively dierent greybody factors from what the xed scalars

exhibit semiclassically. the semiclassical greybody factors are in agreement with d-brane

computations if the couplings were only to (2,2) operators.

the coupling to (1, 3) and (3, 1) operators is guessed from qualitative reasoning based

on the dirac-born-infeld action. since we now have a method of deducing the couplings in

(3.1) based on near-horizon symmetries, let us use it to the case of the xed scalars.

(a) by the mass dimension relation (3.21) we see that the xed scalars  and  correspond

to operators with weights h + h = 4.

(b) the xed scalars have su(2)e  gsu(2)e quantum numbers (1, 1).
as all the supergravity elds are classied according to the shortmultiplets of su(1, 1|2)
su(1, 1|2) we can nd the eld corresponding to these quantum numbers among the short-
multiplets. searching through the shortmultiplets (see below (3.17)), we nd that the xed
scalars belong to the short multiplet (3, 3)s of su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). they occur as top
component of (3, 3)s. there are six xed scalars in all. we conclude that the operators with

66

(h, h) = (1, 3) or (h, h) = (3, 1) (which were inferred by the dbi method) are ruled out by

the analysis of symmetries.

in summary, since the (1, 3) and (3, 1) operators are ruled out by our analysis, the

discrepancy between the d-brane calculation and the semiclassical calculation of absorption

and emission rates disappears.

it is important to note here that couplings guessed from

reasoning based on dirac-born-infeld action turns out to be incorrect.

3.7 intermediate scalars

we just remark that the classication presented in section 3.2 correctly account for all

sixteen intermediate scalars, and predict that they should couple to scft operators with
(h, h) = (1, 2) belonging to the short multiplet (2, 3)s or operators with (h, h) = (2, 1)

belonging to the short multiplet (3, 2)s (see below equation (3.17)). this agrees with the

phenomenological prediction made earlier in the literature [20].

3.8 supergravity from gauge theory

we have seen in this chapter there is a detailed map of the kaluza-klein spectrum of super

gravity in the near horizon geometry of the d1/d5 system to the shortmultiplets of the (4, 4)
scft on m. in this section we show that the gauge theory description of the the break
up the (q1, q5) system to subsystems (q1, q5) and q1, q5) agrees with the description of

this process in supergravity. in chapter 2 we have shown that for the (q1, q5) system to

break up into subsystems have to we set the fayet-iliopoulos terms and the theta term in the

gauge theory to zero. this corresponds to the d1/d5 system with the b+

ij and a1 + a2c6789
moduli set to zero. from now on we will denote the subsystem (q1, q5) as (q1, q5) and the
subsytem q1, q5) as (q1, q5) for convenience. we saw in section 2.9.4 that in the infrared

the description of the splitting process consisted of a linear dilaton with background charge

given by

qscft =s

2

q1q5 + q5q1

(q1q5 + q5q1  1)

(3.24)

we show that the splitting process in supergravity is also controlled by a linear dilaton theory

with the background charge given in (3.24).

67

lets us rst consider the case when q5 = 0 [9]. the ads/cft correspondence tells us
that we need to consider q1 d1-branes in the background of ads3  s3  t 4. (we will work
in the euclidean ads3 coordinates.) the radius of s3 and the anti-de sitter space is given
by r0 = (g2
6q1q5)1/4. for the supergravity to be valid we need to consider the limit
in the gauge theory the linear dilaton corresponded to the distance between the
(1.20).

centre of mass of the two subsytems. therefore we should focus on the distance between the
boundary of ads3  s3  t 4 and the set of q1 d1-branes. we are interested in the infrared
description of the splitting process. by the uv/ir correspondence the d1-branes should
be close to the boundary of the ads3  s3  t 4 to obtain the infrared description of the
splitting process in the supergravity. we assume that the d1-branes are xed at a particular

point on the s3 and the t 4. the action of q1 d1-branes in the background of ads3 and the

ramond-ramond two-form b05 is given by the dbi action. we can use the dbi action for

multiple d1-branes as we are interested only in the dynamics of the centre of mass of thee

collection of q1 d1-branes. the dbi action of q1 d1-branes is given by

s =

q1

2gs z d2eq det (gind
 ) 

q1

2gsz b

(3.25)

where  stands for the world volume coordinates and ,  label these coordinates. gind

 is

the induced metric on the world volume. b is the ramond-ramond 2-form potential. we

chose a gauge in which the world volume coordinates are the coordinates of the boundary

of the ads3. let the metric on the boundary be g(). one can extend the metric g()

on the boundary to the interior of ads3 in the neighbourhood of the boundary [9]. this is

given by

with

ds2 =

g(, 0) = g(),

g(, t) = g()  t2p + o(t3) + . . .

(3.26)

(3.27)

here gp  = r/2. r is the world sheet curvature. the global coordinates of euclidean

ads3 is given by

ds2 = r2

0(d2 + sinh2 d2)

(3.28)

68

where d2 is the round metric on s2. near the boundary the metric is given by

ds2 = r2

0(d2 +

e2

d2)

(3.29)

motivated by this we use  dened as t = 2e to measure the distance from the boundary of

ads3. substituting the metric in (3.26) and the near horizon value of the ramond-ramond

2-form and the dilaton in (3.25) we obtain the following eective action of the d1-branes

near the boundary.

now consider the case when q1 = 0. the q5 d5-branes are wrapped on t 4. therefore
the world volume of the d5-branes is of the form m2  t 4 where m2 is any 2-manifold. the
d5-branes are located at a point on the s3. we ignore the uctuations on t 4 as we are

interested in the dynamics on ads3. the dbi action of q5 d5-branes is given by

q5

325gs3(cid:18)z d6eqdet(gind

 ) z c 6(cid:19)

(3.31)

where c 6 is the ramond-ramond 6-form potential coupling to the d5-brane. performing

a similar calculation for the d5-branes and substituting the near horizon values of the 6-

from ramond-ramond potential, the dilaton and the volume of t 4 one obtains the following

eective actions for the d5-branes

s =

(3.32)

for the case when q1 6= 0 and q5 6= 0 and we just add the contribution from (3.30) and
(3.32) to obtain the eective action of the (q1, q5) string in ads3. the reason we can do this

is because there is no force between the test d1 and d5-branes 1. thus to the leading order

in  the total eective action of the (q1, q5) string near the boundary is given by

s =

(q1q5 + q5q1)

rescaling  so that the the normalization of the kinetic energy term is canonical one obtains

a linear dilaton action with a back ground charge given by

qsugra =q2(q1q5 + q5q1)

(3.34)

we see that the qsugra = qscft for large q1 and q5. thus we are able to derive the

dynamics of the break up of the (q1, q5) system to subsystems from the gauge theory.

chapter 4

the hawking process

in this chapter we put the results of chapter 2 and chapter 3 together and work towards

a precise understanding of hawking radiation from the d1/d5 black hole starting from the

microscopic scft [1]. we rst review the supergravity calculation of hawking radiation

of minimal scalars from the d1/d5 black hole. we are interested in the d1/d5 black

hole with various moduli turned on. we show that in the supergravity calculation the

hawking radiation is independent of the moduli. then we discuss the scft relevant to

the d1/d5 black hole and its relationship with the scft of the d1/d5 system. we review

the formulation of the absorption cross-section calculation from the scft as an evaluation
of the thermal greens function of the operators o(z, z) corresponding to the supergravity
eld . we are able to show that the hawking radiation calculated from the scft agrees

precisely with that of the supergravity calculation if we x the strength of the coupling  in

(1.26) using the ads/cft correspondence. we investigate the dependence of the hawking

radiation of minimal scalars calculated from the scft and show that it is independent of

the moduli as expected from supergravity.

4.1 supergravity calculation of absorption/hawking ra-

diation in presence of moduli

we recall that the d1/d5 black hole solution in the absence of moduli is [2, 3] obtained from

the d1/d5 system by further compactifying x5 on a circle of radius r5 and adding left(right)

moving kaluza-klein momenta along x5. the corresponding supergravity solution is given

in (1.14).

73

the absorption cross-section of minimal scalars in the absence of moduli is given by [4, 5]

abs = 22r2

1r2
5

exp(/th)  1

(exp(/2tr)  1)(exp(/2tl)  1)

where th is given by

2
th

=

1
tl

+

1
tr

(4.1)

(4.2)

the quantities tl, tr, r1, r5 are as dened in (1.25) and (1.14). we will now show that the

absorption cross-section remains unchanged even when the moduli are turned on.

from the equations of motion of type iib supergravity [6], we can explicitly see that

the ve-dimensional einstein metric ds2

5,ein is not changed by turning on the sixteen moduli
corresponding to the metric gij on t 4 and the ramond-ramond 2-form potential b. as

regards the four blowing up moduli, the invariance of ds2

5,ein can be seen from the fact that

turning on these moduli corresponds to so(4, 5) transformation (which is a part of a u-

duality transformation) and from the fact that the einstein metric does not change under

u-duality. now we know that the minimal scalars i all satisfy the wave-equation

di = 0

(4.3)

where the laplacian is with respect to the einstein metric in ve dimensions. since it is only

this wave equation that determines the absorption cross-section completely, we see that abs

is the same as before.

it is straightforward to see that the hawking rate, given by

h = abs(e/th  1)1 d4k

(2)4

(4.4)

is also not changed when moduli are turned on.

4.2 near horizon geometry of the d1/d5 black hole

in order to nd out the scft relevant for the d1/d5 black hole let us review the near

horizon geometry of the d1/d5 black hole. the near horizon scaling limit is given by [7]

  0,

r  0,

r0  0

where l2 = g6q1q5. it can be seen that this geometry is that of bt zt 4s3 using the co-

ordinate redenitions given below. (here bt z refers to the black hole in three-dimensional

anti de-sitter space discovered by [8].)

our co-ordinate denitions are as follows: t, , r refer to btz co-ordinates, 3 stands for

the s3 and x6, x7, x8, x9 stand for the co-ordinates of t 4. the mass m and the angular

momentum j of the btz black hole are given by

m =

+ + r2
r2


l2

j =

2r+r

(4.10)

the mass m and the angular momentum j for the btz black hole are related to the

parameters of the d1/d5 black hole by

(4.11)

where nl, nr are dened in (1.25) and l0, l0 are the levels of the scft. the extremal
limit is given by r+ = r. from (4.10) and (4.11) we see that in the extremal limit nr = 0
as expected for the d1/d5 black hole.

in order to nd the relevant scft corresponding to the d1/d5 black hole let us look at

the limit r+ = r = 0. substituting these values in (4.9) we nd the metric is given by

ds2


r2
l2 dx2

0 +

l2
r2 dr2 + r2d2

= 

(4.12)

in the above equation we have suppressed the t 4 and the s3 part of the metric. by compari-

son with (3.5) one can see that this metric is locally ads3 except for the global identication
   + 2. let us compare this metric with that of ads3 in this global co-ordinates. in
this co-ordinate system the metric of the ads3 is given by

ds2


= (

r2 + l2

l2

)dx2

0 +

l2

r2 + l2 dt2 + r2d2

(4.13)

the geometry of the zero mass bt z black hole and that of the ads3 (although identical

locally) has an important dierence in the boundary conditions for the fermions. for the

case of ads3 the fermions are anti-periodic in  and for the zero mass bt z black hole they

are periodic in . one can easily see that the constant time slice of the metric in (4.13) has

the topology of a disk. this forces the fermions to be anti-periodic in  for ads3. for the

case of the zero mass bt z black hole in (4.13), the constant time slice has a singularity

at r = 0. therefore the fermions can be both periodic or anti-periodic. an analysis of the

killing spinors in the background of the zero mass bt z [9] shows that the fermions have to

be periodic. thus the scft at the boundary of the zero mass bt z is in the ramond sector

while for the ads3 case it is in the neveu-schwarz sector.

from the above discussion we nd that the scft relevant for the d1/d5 black hole
with kaluza-klein momentum n = 0 is the ramond vacuum of the n = (4, 4) scft on
the orbifold m. the microscopic states corresponding to the general d1/d5 black hole are
states with l0 6= 0 and l0 6= 0 excited over the ramond vaccum of the n = (4, 4) scft on
the orbifold m.

76

4.3 the coupling with the bulk elds in the ramond

sector

in chapter 3 the coupling of the supergravity elds  with the operators o of the n = (4, 4)
scft on the m in (3.1) was determined using the neveu-schwarz sector. in this section
we argue that these couplings will not change in the ramond sector. interaction terms in

scft lagrangian do not depend on whether one is in the ramond sector or in the neveu-

schwarz sector. it is only the quantities like partition function which change on going from

the neveu-schwarz sector to the ramond sector. the scaling dimension of an operator is

given by operator product expansions(opes) with the stress energy tensor. since opes are

local relations , they do not change on going from the neveu-schwarz sector to the ramond

sector. therefore the operators corresponding to the minimal scalars determined in chapter

3 will not change for the d1/d5 black hole.

4.4 determination of the strength of the coupling 

before we perform the calculation of hawking radiation/absorption cross-section from the

scft corresponding to the d1/d5 black hole it is important to determine the strength of

the coupling  in (1.26). in this section we will determine  for the case of minimal scalars

hij.1 in chapter 2 we have identied the scft operator corresponding to these elds of the

supergravity. the scft operator is given by

oij(z, z) = x{i

a (z, z) xj}a (z, z) 

1
4

ijxk
a

xk

a(z, z)

(4.14)

let us suppose the background metric of the torus t 4 is gij = ij. the interaction

lagrangian of the scft with the uctuation hij is given by

sint = tez d2z hhijxi

a

xj

ai

(4.15)

the eective string tension te of the conformal eld theory , which also appears in the free

part of the action

(4.16)

s0 = tez d2z hzxi

azxi,a + fermionsi

1from now on hij will denote the traceless part of the metric uctuations of t 4.

77

has been discussed in [6, 12, 13]. the specic value of te is not important for the calculation

of the s-matrix for absorption or emission, since the factor just determines the normalization
of the two-point function of the operator oij(z, z). in this section we will argue that the
constant  = 1.

a direct string theory computation would of course provide the constant  as well (albeit

at weak coupling). this would be analogous to xing the normalization of the dirac-born-

infeld action for a single d-brane by comparing with one-loop open string diagram [16].

however, for a large number and more than one type of d-branes it is a dicult proposition

and we will not attempt to pursue it here. fortunately, the method of symmetries using the
ads/cft employed for determining the operator o helps us determine the value of  as
well. for the latter, however, we need to use the more quantitative version [17, 18] of the

maldacena conjecture. we will see below that for this quantitative conjecture to be true for
the two-point function (which can be calculated independently from the n = (4, 4) scft
and from supergravity) we need  = 1.

we have seen that the above normalization leads to precise equality between the absorp-

tion cross-sections (and consequently hawking radiation rates) computed from the moduli

space of the d1/d5 system and from semiclassical gravity. this method of xing the nor-

malization can perhaps be criticized on the ground that it borrows from supergravity and

does not rely entirely on the scft. however, we would like to emphasize two things:

(a) we have xed  = 1 by comparing with supergravity around ads3 background which

does not have a black hole. on the other hand, the supergravity calculation of absorption

cross-section and hawking ux is performed around a black hole background represented in

the near-horizon limit by the btz black hole. from the viewpoint of semiclassical gravity

these two backgrounds are rather dierent. the fact that normalizing  with respect to

the former background leads to the correctly normalized absorption cross-section around the

black hole background is a rather remarkable prediction.

(b) similar issues are involved in xing the coupling constant between the electron and the

electromagnetic eld in the semiclassical theory of radiation in terms of the physical elec-

tric charge, and in similarly xing the gravitational coupling of extended objects in terms

78

of newtons constant. these issues too are decided by comparing two-point functions of

currents with coulombs or newtons laws respectively. in the present case the quantitative

version of the ads/cft conjecture [17, 18] provides the counterpart of newtons law or

coulombs law at strong coupling. without this the best result one can achieve is that the

hawking radiation rates computed from d1/d5 branes and from semiclassical gravity are

proportional.

we should remark that xing the normalization by the use of dirac-born-infeld action,

as has been done previously, is not satisfactory since the dbi action is meant for single

d-branes and extending it to a system of multiple d1/d5 branes does not always give the

right results as we have seen in section 3.6. the method of equivalence principle to x the

normalization is not very general and cannot be applied to the case of non-minimal scalars,

for example.

let us now compare the two-point function for the minimal scalar hij determined from

the ads/cft correspondence and the scft to determine the normalization constant . we

will discuss the more quantitative version of the ads/cft conjecture [18, 17] to compare
the 2-point correlation function of oij from supergravity and scft.

the relation between the correlators are as follows. let the supergravity lagrangian be

l = z d3x1d3x2bij,ij (x1, x2)hij(x1)hij (x2)
+ z d3x1d3x2d3x3cij,ij ,ij (x1, x2, x3)hij(x1)hij (x2)hij (x3) + . . .

(4.17)

where we have only exhibited terms quadratic and cubic in the hijs. the coecient b

determines the propagator and the coecient c is the tree-level 3-point vertex in supergravity.
the 2-point function of the oijs (at large gsq1, gsq5) is given by [18, 17], assuming sint

given by (4.15)

hoij(z1)oij (z2)i

= 2(te)2r d3x1d3x2 [bij,ij (x1, x2)k(x1|z1)k(x2|z2)] ,

neveu-schwarz neveu-schwarz and ramond-ramond backgrounds.

our aim will be to obtain the lagrangian of the minimally coupled scalars corresponding

to the uctuations of the metric of the t 4 in the d1/d5-brane system. we will nd the la-

grangian up to cubic order in the near horizon limit. let us rst focus on ins. we substitute

the values of the background elds of the d1/d5 system in the type iib lagrangian with

the following change in the metric

ramond charges and the value of g. the contribution from the electric part of b, after

going to the near-horizon limit and performing the integral over s3 and t 4 is

the contribution of the magnetic part of b in the same limit is

81

(4.28)

(4.29)

we note that the contribution of the electric and the magnetic parts cancel giving no cou-

plings for the minimal scalars to the ramond-ramond background. therefore the tree-level

supergravity action correct to cubic order in h is given by

i = 

q1q5

16 z d3z [hijhij + (hikhkj)hij]

(4.30)

the coecient q1q5/(16) is u-duality invariant. this is because it is a function of

only the integers q1 and q5. this can be tested by computing the same coecient from the

neveu-schwarz/fundamental string background which is related to the d1/d5 system by s-

duality. the neveu-schwarz/fundamental string back ground also gives the same coecient.

u-duality transformations which generate bn s backgrounds [20] also give rise to the same

coecient.

4.4.2 two-point function

the two-point function of the operator oij can be evaluated by substituting the value of
bij,ij (x1, x2) obtained from (4.30) into (4.18) and using the boundary-to-bulk greens func-

tion given in (4.19). on evaluating the integral in (4.18) using formulae given in [22], we

nd that

hoij(z)oij (w)i = (te)2iijj 

q1q5
162

1

|z  w|4

(4.31)

this is exactly the value of the two-point function obtained from the scft described by the

free lagrangian (2.17) provided we put  = 1.

we have compared the two-point function obtained from the supergravity corresponding

to the near horizon geometry of the d1/d5 system with no moduli to the orbifold scft.

as we have argued before the orbifold scft corresponds to the d1/d5 system with moduli.

thus naively this comparison seems to be meaningless. on further examination we note that

the coecient bij,ij  in (4.18) was u-duality invariant. since the d1/d5 system with moduli

can be obtained through u-duality transformations we know that this coecient will not

change for the d1/d5 system with moduli. it is only the value of this coecient which xes

 to be 1. thus the comparison we have made is valid. it is remarkable that even at strong
coupling the two-point function of oij can be computed from the free lagrangian (4.16).
this is consistent with the non-renormalization theorems involving the n = (4, 4) scft.

82

the choice  = 1 ensures that the perturbation (4.15) of (4.16) is consistent with the

perturbation implied in (4.21). we will see in the next section that this choice leads to

precise equality between absorption cross-sections (consequently hawking radiation rates)

calculated from semiclassical gravity and from the d1/d5 branes. the overall multiplicative

constant te will not be important for the absorption cross-section calculation. this factor

nally cancels o in the calculation as we will see in section 4.7.

4.5 the black hole state

as we have seen, the general non-extremal black hole will have kaluza-klein excitations
along both the directions on the s1. in the scft, it is represented by states with l0 6= 0
and l0 6= 0 over the ramond vacuum. the black hole is represented by a density matrix

 =

1

 x{i}

|iihi|

(4.32)

the states |ii belongs to the various twisted sectors of the orbifold theory. they satisfy the
constraint

l0 =

nl
q1q5

l0 =

nr
q1q5

(4.33)

we have suppressed the index which labels the vacuum.  is the volume of the phase

space in the micro-canonical ensemble. it can be seen that the maximally twisted sector of

the orbifold gives rise to the dominant contribution to the sum in (4.32) over the various

twisted sectors. the maximally twisted sector is obtained by the action of the twist operator

p(q1q51)/2 on the ramond vacuum. from the opes in (2.55) we see that the twist operator
p(q1q51)/2 introduces a cut in the complex plane such that

xa(e2iz, e2i z) = xa+1(z, z)

(4.34)

thus this changes the boundary conditions of the bosons and the fermions. again from

the opes in (2.55) one infers that the excitations like 1|p(q1q51)/2i over the maximally

twisted sector have modes in units of 1/q1q5. a simple way of understanding that the

maximally twisted sector has modes in units of 1/(q1q5) is to note that the boundary

83

conditions in (4.34) imply that xa(z, z) is periodic with a period of 2q1q5. this forces

the modes to be quantized in units of 1/(q1q5).

we now show that the maximally twisted sector can account for the entire entropy of the

black hole. the entropy of the d1/d5 black hole given in (1.16) can be written as

ssu gra = 2qnl + 2qnr

(4.35)

using cardys formula, the degeneracy of the states in the maximally twisted sector with
l0 = nl/q1q5 and l0 = nr/q1q5 is given by

 = e2nl+2nr

by the boltzmann formula,

s(maximally twisted) = 2qnl + 2qnr

(4.36)

(4.37)

thus the maximally twisted sector entirely accounts for the d1/d5 black hole entropy. nl

and nr are multiples of q1q5 due to the orbifold projection. therefore, the entropy can be

written as

s = 2qnlq1q5 + 2qnrq1q5

(4.38)

with this understanding, we restrict the calculations of hawking radiation and absorp-

tion cross-section only to the maximally twisted sector. the probability amplitude for the

hawking process is given by

p =

1

xf,i |hf|sint|ii|2

(4.39)

where |fi denotes the nal states the black hole can decay into. we have averaged over the
initial states in the micro-canonical ensemble.

it is more convenient to work with the canonical ensemble. we now discuss the method

of determining the temperature of the canonical ensemble. consider the generating function

z = trr(ele0er e0)

(4.40)

where the trace is done over the ramond states in the maximally twisted sector. e0 and e0

are energies of the left and the right moving modes.

e0 =

l0
r5

,

e0 =

l0
r5

84

(4.41)

from the generating function z in (4.40) we see that the coecient of e(lnl)/(q1q5r5) and
e(rnr)/(q1q5r5) is the degeneracy of the states with l0 = nl/q1q5 and l0 = nr/q1q5

corresponding to the d1/d5 black hole. a simple way to satisfy this constraint is to choose
l and r such that z is peaked at this value of l0 and l0.

evaluating the trace one obtains

z =

yn=1  1 + e(ln)/(q1q5r5)

1  e(ln)/(q1q5r5)!4   1 + e(rn)/(q1q5r5)
1  e(rn)/(q1q5r5)!4

then

ln z = 4" xn=1
+4" xn=1

ln(1 + eln/q1q5r5) 

ln(1 + ern/q1q5r5) 

ln(1  eln/q1q5r5)#
ln(1  ern/q1q5r5)#

xn=1
xn=1

we can evaluate the sum by approximating it by an integral given by

ln z = 4q1q5r5z 

0

dx ln  1 + elx

1  elx! + ln  1 + erx
1  erx!

from the partition function in (4.40) we see that

 ln z
l

q1q5r5

and 

 ln z

=

q1q5r5

(4.42)

(4.43)

(4.44)

(4.45)

(4.46)

where <  > indicates the average value of nl and nr. as the distribution is peaked at nl
and nr we assume that < nl >= nl and < nr >= nr. using (4.45) we obtain

thus

ensemble.

4.6 absorption cross-section as thermal greens func-

tion

let us now relate the absorption cross-section of a supergravity uctuation  to the thermal
greens function of the corresponding operator of the n = (4, 4) scft on the orbifold m
[21]. the notation  implies that we are considering the supergravity eld to be of the form

 = 0 +  

(4.49)

where 0 represents the background value and  is the strength of the coupling.

where

s = s0 +z d2z[0 +  ]o(z, z)

= s0 + sint

s0 = s0 +z d2z 0o(z, z)
sint = z d2z  o(z, z)

(4.50)

(4.51)

(4.52)

o is the operator corresponding to supergravity eld . s0 is the lagrangian of the scft
which includes the deformations due to various backgrounds in the supergravity. for exam-

ple, the free lagrangian in (4.16) corresponds to the case when the eld a1 + a2c6789 in

(3.20) is turned on.

we calculate the absorption of a quanta   = 5eipx corresponding to the operator o
using the fermis golden rule. 5 is related to the ve-dimensional newtons constant g5

and the ten-dimensional newtons constant g10 as

2
5 = 8g5 =

8g10
v42r5

=

647g2
s 4
v42r5

(4.53)

we see that 5 is proportional to 2.

in the maldacena limit (4.5) the coupling of the

bulk uctuation to the scft drops out. we retain this term for our calculation as hawking

radiation absorption cross-section is an o(1/n) eect. we will see below that the absorption

cross-section turns out to be proportional g6q1q52. from (4.7) we see that this is the fourth

86

power of the radius of s3. the radius of s3 is large for the supergravity to be valid. thus

although in the maldacena limit (4.5) the coupling of the bulk uctuation to the scft drops

out, the factors of q1q5 picked up in the calculation ensure that this coupling survives for the

comparison with supergravity. furthermore, in analogy with ads5/cf t4 correspondence
the number of colours n of the n = 4 superyang mills in four dimensions corresponds to
q1q5. as the absorption cross-section is proportional to q1q5, this is a o(1/n) eect.

in this computation of the absorption cross-section the black hole is represented by a

canonical ensemble at a given temperature. the above interaction gives the thermally aver-
aged transition probability p as
pif = 22

here i and f refer to initial and nal states respectively. pi, pf refers to the initial and nal

momenta of these states. l = 2r5 denotes the length of the string and t is the time of

interaction. as we have seen in section 4.5, the inverse temperature  has two components

l and r. the relation of these temperatures to the parameters of the d1/d5 black hole is

l =

1
tl

and r =

1
tr

(4.55)

the left moving momenta p+ and the right moving momenta p are in a thermal bath with
inverse temperatures l and r respectively.  p is dened as  p = lp+ + rp. z stands
for the partition function of the thermal ensemble.

the greens function in euclidean time is given by

g(i, x) = ho(i, x)o(0, 0)i = tr(t{o(i, x)o(0, 0)})

(4.56)

where  = ep/z. time ordering is dened as t with respect to imaginary(t). this
denition coincides with radial ordering on mapping the co-ordinate (, x) from the cylinder

to the plane. the advantage of doing this is that the integral

z dt dx eipxg(t  i, x) =xi,f

epi

z

(2)22(p + pi  pf )|hf|o(0, 0)|ii|2

(4.57)

the greens function g is determined by the two-point function of the operator o. this is
in turn determined by conformal dimension (h, h) of the operator o and the normalization
of the two-point function.

87

as we have to subtract out the emission probability we get the cross-section as

absf t = p(1  ep)

(4.58)

where f is the ux and p is given by (4.54). substituting the value of p from (4.57) we get

abs =

22

5l

f z dt dx(g(t  i, x)  g(t + i, x))

(4.59)

in the above equation we have related the evaluation of the absorption cross-section to the

evaluation of the thermal greens function. evaluating the integral one obtains

4.7 absorption cross-section of minimal scalars from

the d1/d5 scft

in the previous section we related the thermal greens function of the scft operator to

the absorption cross-section. we will apply the results of the previous section for the case

of the minimal scalars. we will consider the case of the minimal scalars corresponding to

the uctuation of the metric of t 4. let the background metric of the torus be ij. consider

the minimal scalar h67. we know the scft operator corresponding to this has conformal

dimension (1, 1). from section 4.4 we know that  = 1. the interaction lagrangian is given

by

sint = 2tez d2zh67x6

a(z, z) x7

a(z, z)

(4.61)

where we have set  = 1. the factor of 2 arises because of the symmetric property of h67.

s0 is given by

s0 = tez d2zxi

a(z, z) xj

a(z, z)

(4.62)

88

comparing with the previous section the operator o = 2tex6
absorption of a quanta of energy  using (4.60) we obtain

a(z, z) x7

a(z, z). for the

abs = 22r2

(exp(/2tr)  1)(exp(/2tl)  1)

(4.63)

where we have l = 2r5, f = , (4.53) for 5 and (4.31) for co. comparing the absorption
cross-section of the minimal scalars obtained from supergravity in (4.1) with (4.63) we nd

that

abs( scft) = abs( supergravity)

(4.64)

thus the scft calculation and the supergravity calculation of the absorption cross-section

agree exactly.

it is important to note that we have used the n = (4, 4) scft realized as a free scft
on the orbifold m as the background lagrangian s0. as we have said before, this scft
is non-singular and therefore cannot correspond to the case of the d1/d5 system with no

moduli. in section 4.1 we have argued that the supergravity calculation of the absorption

cross-section is independent of moduli. therefore it makes sense to compare it with the

scft result for the case with moduli turned on. in the next section we will show that the

scft calculation is also independent of the moduli.

another point worth mentioning is that the method followed in the thesis for the calcu-

lation of the absorption-crossection from the scft can be easily extended for the case of

minimal scalars corresponding to the four blow up modes. this is not possible if one uses

the long string model as the microscopic theory for the d1/d5 black hole. the simple reason

being that these operators are not present in the long string model.

4.8 independence of hawking radiation on d1/d5 mod-

uli

in this section we will study the independence of the hawking radiation on d1/d5 moduli.
in chapter 2 we have listed the twenty (1,1) operators oi(z, z) in the scft based on the
symmetric product orbifold m which is dual to the d1/d5 system. turning on various

89

moduli i of supergravity corresponds to perturbing the scft

s = s0 +xi z d2z ioi(z, z)

(4.65)

where i denote the near-horizon limits of the various moduli elds i. we note here that s0
corresponds to the free scft based on the symmetric product orbifold m. since this scft
is non-singular (all correlation functions are nite), it does not correspond to the marginally

stable bps solution originally found in [2, 3]. instead, it corresponds to a ve-dimensional

black hole solution in supergravity with suitable blow-up moduli turned on.

let us now calculate the absorption cross-section of a supergravity uctuation i to

the thermal greens function of the corresponding operator of the scft. the notation i

implies that we are considering the supergravity eld to be of the form

i = i

0 + i

(4.66)

where i

0 represents the background value and  is the strength of the coupling.

where

s = s0 +z d2z[ i

0 +  i]oi(z, z)

= s0 + sint

s0 = s0 +z d2z i
0oi(z, z)
sint = z d2z  ioi(z, z)

(4.67)

(4.68)

(4.69)

as we have seen in the section 4.6 the absorption cross-section of the supergravity uc-
tuation i involves essentially the two-point function of the operator oi calculated with
respect to the scft action s0. since oi is a marginal operator, its two-point function is
completely determined apart from a constant. regarding the marginality of the operators
oi, it is easy to establish it upto one-loop order by direct computation (cijk = 0). the fact
that these operators are exactly marginal can be argued as follows. the twenty operators
oi arise as top components of ve chiral primaries. it is known that the number of chiral
primaries with (jr, jr) = (m, n) is the hodge number h2m,2n of the target space m of the

90

scft. since this number is a topological invariant, it should be the same at all points of

the moduli space of deformations.

we showed in section 4.4 that if the operator oi corresponding to hij is canonically
normalized (ope has residue 1) and if i is canonically normalized in supergravity, then the

normalization of sint as in (4.69) ensures that abs from scft agrees with the supergravity

result. the crucial point now is the following: once we x the normalization of sint at a
given point in moduli space, at some other point it may acquire a constant (6= 1) in front
of the integral when oi and i are canonically normalized at the new point. this would
imply that abs will get multiplied by this constant, in turn implying disagreement with

supergravity. we need to show that this does not happen.

to start with a simple example, let us rst restrict to the moduli gij of the torus ft 4. we

have

s =z d2z xi xjgij

the factor of string tension has been absorbed in the denition of xi.

in section 4.4 we had gij = ij + hij, leading to

s = s0 + sint

s0 = z d2z xi xjij
sint = z d2z xi xjhij

(4.70)

(4.71)

in the above equation we have set  = 1. as we have remarked above, this sint gives rise to

the correctly normalized abs.

now, if we expand around some other metric

gij = g0ij + hij

(4.72)

then the above action (4.70) implies

s = sg0 + sint

sg0 = z d2z xi xjg0ij

91

sint = z d2z xi xjhij

(4.73)

now the point is that neither hij nor the operator oij = x i x j in sint is canonically
normalized at gij = g0ij. when we do use the canonically normalized operators, do we pick

up an additional constant in front?

note that

hoijoklig0 = gik

0 gjl

0 |z  w|4

and

hhij(x)hkl(y)ig0 = g0,ikg0,jld(x, y)

(4.74)

(4.75)

where d(x, y) is the massless scalar propagator

this shows that
statement (1): the two-point functions of oij and hij pick up inverse factors .
as a result, sint remains correctly normalized when re-written in terms of the canonically

normalized h and o and no additional constant is picked up.
the above result is in fact valid in the full twenty dimensional moduli space fm because

statement (1) above remains true generally.

to see this, let us rst rephrase our result for the special case of the metric moduli (4.70)

in a more geometric way. the gijs can be regarded as some of the coordinates of the moduli

space fm (known to be a coset so(4, 5)/(so(4) so(5))). the innitesimal perturbations

hij, hkl can be thought of as dening tangent vectors at the point g0,ij (namely the vectors

/gij, /gkl). the (residue of the) two-point function given by (4.74) denes the inner

product between these two tangent vectors according to the zamolodchikov metric [23, 24].

the fact that the moduli space fm of the n = (4, 4) scft on m is the coset so(4, 5)/(so(4)
so(5)) is argued in [24]. if the superconformal theory has n = (4, 4) supersymmety and if
the dimension of the moduli space is d then it is shown in [24] that the moduli space of the

scft is given by

so(4, d/4)

so(4)  so(d/4)

92

(4.76)

the outline of the argument is a follows. an n = (4, 4) scft has superconformal su(2)r
gsu(2)r symmetry. we have seen that the bottom component of the short multiplet which
contains the marginal operator (2, 2)s transforms as a (2, 2) under su(2)r  gsu(2)r.

the top component which corresponds to the moduli transforms as a (1, 1) under the r-

symmetry. the holonomy group of the zamolodchikov metric should leave invariant the

action of su(2)r  gsu(2)r. then the holonomy group should have a form

k  su(2)  su(2)  k  so(d)

(4.77)

then (4.77) together with n = (4, 4) supersymmetry and the left-right symmetry of the two
su(2)rs of the scft xes the moduli space to be uniquely that given in (4.76). we have
found in chapter 2 that there are 20 marginal operators for the n = (4, 4) scft on the
orbifold m. therefore the dimension of the moduli space is 20. thus fm is given by

(4.78)

so(4, 5)

so(4)  so(5)

fm =

consider, on the other hand, the propagator (inverse two-point function) of hij, hkl in

supergravity. the moduli space action of low energy uctuations is nothing but the su-

pergravity action evaluated around the classical solutions g0,ij. the kinetic term of such a

moduli space action denes the metric of moduli space. the statement (1) above is a simple

reection of the fact that the zamolodchikov metric denes the metric on moduli space, and

hence

statement (2): the propagator of supergravity uctuations, viewed as a matrix, is the

inverse of the two-point functions in the scft.

the last statement is of course not specic to the moduli gij and is true of all the moduli.

we nd, therefore, that xing the normalization of sint (4.69) at any one point 0 ensures
that the normalization remains correct at any other point 0 by virtue of statement (2). we

should note in passing that statement (2) is consistent with, and could have been derived

from ads/cft correspondence as applied to the two-point function.

thus, we nd that abs is independent of the moduli, in agreement with the result from

supergravity.

93

4.9 entropy and area

here we make a brief mention of the fact that the correspondence between bekenstein-

hawking entropy and the scft entropy remains true in the presence of all the twenty

moduli. the reason is that in supergravity the einstein metric remains unchanged (see

section 4.1) and therefore the area of the event horizon remains the same (this can be

explicitly veried using the supergravity solution in [20]). in the scft, since the operators

corresponding to the above moduli are all exactly marginal (section 4.8) therefore the central

charge remains unchanged and hence, by cardys formula, the entropy does not change, in

agreement with the bekenstein-hawking formula.

concluding remarks and discussions

in this thesis we have made precise the microscopic understanding of hawking radiation

from the d1/d5 black hole. our investigations have the following conclusions.

(a) we presented an explicit construction of all the marginal operators in the scft of the
d1/d5 system based on the orbifold m. these are twenty in number, four of which are
constructed using z2 twist operators and correspond to blowing up modes of the orbifold.
(b) we classied the the twenty near-horizon moduli of supergravity on ads3  s3  t 4
according to representations of su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2)  so(4)i.
(c) we established one-to-one correspondence between the supergravity moduli and the

marginal operators by inventing a new so(4) symmetry in the scft which we identied

with the so(4)i of supergravity.
(d) we have explictly constructed all the chiral primaries of the n = (4, 4) scft on m.
(e) we analyzed gauge theory dynamics of the d1/d5 system relevant for the splitting of
the bound state (q1, q5)  (q1, q5) + (q1, q5).
(f) we have settled a problem in the context of xed scalars by showing that consistency

with near-horizon symmetry demands that they cannot couple to (1,3) or (3,1) operators.

they can only couple to (2,2) operators. this removes earlier discrepancies between d-brane

calculations and semiclassical calculations of absorption and emission.

(g) the black hole is represented by a density matrix of a microcanonical ensemble consisting
of states of the various twisted sectors of the n = (4, 4) scft on the orbifold m. the
dominant contribution to the density matrix is from the maximally twisted sector of the
orbifold m. the maximally twisted sector can be obtained by applying the q1q5-cycle

97

twist operator over the ramond vacuum. the coupling of the bulk eld to the orbifold scft

was deduced using the method of symmetries. these symmetries include the symmetries of

the near-horizon geometry, as emphasized by the ads/cft correspondence. we calculate

the absorption cross-section by relating it to the thermal greens funtion of the scft. the

thermal nature of hawking radiation is because we have averaged over several microstates.

(h) we determine the normalization of the interaction lagrangian which couples cft op-

erators to bulk modes by using the quantitative version of the ads/cft correspondence,

where we compare two-point functions computed from cft and from supergravity around

ads3 background. the normalization xed this way remarkably leads to precise equality of

absorption cross-sections (consequently hawking radiation rates) computed from cft and

from supergravity around the black hole background.

(i) we showed in supergravity as well as in scft that the absorption cross-section for

minimal scalars is the same for all values of the moduli, therefore establishing the agreement

between scft and supergravity all over the moduli space.

we will now discuss some directions for future research.

(a) it is important to determine the absorption cross-section of the xed scalars from the

orbifold scft. we have deterimed all the chiral primaries of the shortmultiplet (2, 2)s which

contains the operators corresponding to the xed scalars as its top component. we can use
these chiral primaries to dermine all the operators with conformal dimensions (h, h) = (2, 2)

corresponding to the xed scalars. it would be interesting to see if the absorption cross-

section calculated using these operators reproduce the semi-classical result.

(b) one can nd the description of hawking radiation of scalars carrying angular momentum
within the framework of the scft on m.
(d) it is very crucial to nd the supergravity solutions of the d1/d5 system with moduli

turned on. it is only then we can explicitly check the prediction made in this thesis that

hawking radiation for minimal scalars does not depend on the moduli for the d1/d5 black

hole.

(e) recent developments has suggested that constant bn s moduli is associated with non-

commutative geometry. it is important to investigate the d1/d5 system with bn s moduli

98

turned on. the microscopic theory of the d1/d5 system with bn s moduli encodes informa-

tion about the moduli space of instantons on a non-commutative torus t 4.
