the relationship between the perturbation theory in light-front coordinates and
lorentz-covariant perturbation theory is investigated. a method for nding the
dierence between separate terms of the corresponding series without their explicit
evaluation is proposed. a procedure of constructing additional counter-terms to
the canonical hamiltonian that compensate this dierence at any nite order is
proposed. for the yukawa model, the light-front hamiltonian with all of these
counter-terms is obtained in a closed form. possible application of this approach to
gauge theories is discussed.

1. introduction

the hamiltonian approach to quantum eld theory in light-front coordinates (lf),
x = 12 (x0  x3), x = {x1, x2}, is attractive as a possible method of solving strong
interaction problems. in this approach, the formal triviality of the physical vacuum allows
one to seek bound states without prior investigation of the complex vacuum structure.
however, as is already known, canonical quantization in lf, i.e., on the x+ = const
hypersurface, can result in a theory not quite equivalent to the lorentz-invariant theory
(i.e., to the standard feynman formalism). this is due, rst of all, to strong singularities
at zero values of the light-like momentum variables q = 12
(q0  q3). to restore the
equivalence with a lorentz-covariant theory, one has to add unusual counter-terms to the
formal canonical hamiltonian for the lf, h = p+ = 12(p0 + p3) (the operator of a shift
along the x+-axis). these counter-terms can be found by comparing the perturbation
theory based on the canonical lf formalism with lorentz-covariant perturbation theory.
this is done in the present paper. the light-front hamiltonian thus obtained can then
be used in nonperturbative calculations. it is possible, however, that perturbation theory
does not provide all of the necessary additions to the canonical hamiltonian, as some of
these additions can be nonperturbative. in spite of this, it seems necessary to examine
this problem within the framework of perturbation theory rst.

for practical purposes a stationary noncovariant light-front perturbation theory, which
is similar to the one applied in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, is widely used. it was
found [1, 2, 3] that the light-front dyson formalism allows this theory to be trans-
formed into an equivalent light-front feynman theory (under an appropriate regulariza-
tion). then, by re-summing the integrands of the feynman integrals, one can recast
their form so that they become the same as in the lorentz-covariant theory. (this is not
the case for diagrams without external lines, which we do not consider here.) then, the
dierence between the light-front and lorentz-covariant approaches that persists is only
due to the dierent regularizations and dierent methods of calculating the feynman in-
tegrals (which is important because of the possible absence of their absolute convergence
in pseudo-euclidean space). in the present paper, we concentrate on the analysis of this
dierence.

a light-front theory needs not only the standard uv regularization, but also a special
in our approach, this regularization elimi-
regularization of the singularities q = 0.
nates the creation operators a+(q) and annihilation operators a(q) with |qi
| <  from
the fourier expansion of the eld operators in the eld representation. as a result, the
integration w.r.t. the corresponding momentum q over the range (,)  (,)
is associated with each line before removing the -functions. dierent propagators are
regularized independently, which allows the described re-arrangement of the perturbation
theory series. on the other hand, this regularization is convenient for further nonper-
turbative numerical calculations with the light-front hamiltonian, to which the necessary
counter-terms are added (the eective hamiltonian). we require that this hamiltonian
generate a theory equivalent to the lorentz-covariant theory when the regularization is
removed. note that lorentz-invariant methods of regularization (e.g., pauli-villars reg-

2

ularization) are far less convenient for numerical calculations and we shall only briey
mention them.

the specic properties of the light-front feynman formalism manifest themselves only
in the integration over the variables q = 12 (q0  q3), while integration over the trans-
verse momenta q  {q1, q2} is the same in the light-front and the lorentz coordinates
(though it might be nontrivial because it requires regularization and renormalization).
therefore, we concentrate on a comparison of diagrams for xed transverse momenta
(which is equivalent to a two-dimensional problem).

in the present paper, we propose a method that allows one to nd the dierence (in
the limit   0) between any light-front feynman integral and the corresponding lorentz-
covariant integral without having to calculate them completely. based on this method,
a procedure is elaborated for constructing an eective hamiltonian in lf in any order
of perturbation theory. the procedure can be applied to all nongauge eld theories, as
well as to abelian and non-abelian gauge theories in the gauge a = 0 with the vector
meson propagator chosen according to the mandelstam-leibbrandt prescription [4, 5].
the question of whether the additional components of the hamiltonian that arise can be
combined into a nite number of counter-terms must be dealt with separately in each
particular case.

application of this formalism to the yukawa model makes it possible to obtain the
eective light-front hamiltonian in a closed form. the result agrees with the conclusions
of the work [1], where a comparison was made of the light-front and lorentz-covariant
methods via calculating self-energy diagrams in all orders of perturbation theory and other
diagrams in lowest orders. conversely, for gauge theories (both abelian and non-abelian),
it was found that counter-terms of arbitrarily high order in eld operators must be added
to the eective hamiltonian. this result may turn out to be wrong if the contributions
to the counter-terms are mutually canceled. this calls for further investigation, but such
possibility appears to be very unlikely.

what we have said above does not depreciate the light-front formalism as applied to
gauge theories. this is because the only requirement concerning the light-front hamil-
tonian is that it correctly reproduces all gauge-invariant quantities rather than the o-
mass-shell feynman integrals in a given gauge. however, renormalization of the light-front
hamiltonian turns out to be a dicult problem and it requires new approaches. we do
not examine the possibilities of changing the light-front hamiltonian by introducing new
nonphysical elds by a method dierent from the pauli-villars regularization [6] or the
possibilities of using gauges more general than a = 0 with the mandelstam-leibbrandt
propagator. these points also need to be investigated further.

2. reduction of light-front and lorentz-covariant

feynman integrals to a form convenient for comparison

let us examine an arbitrary ipi feynman diagram. we x all external momenta and

all transverse momenta of integration, and integrate only over q+ and q:

f = lim

qi d2qi
qi(2qi

f (qi, pk)

we assume that all vertices are polynomial and that the propagator has the form

z(q)

q2  m2 + i

,

or

z(q) q+

(q2  m2 + i)(2q+q + i)

,

(1)

(2)

where z(q) is a polynomial. a propagator of the second type in (2) arises in gauge theories
in the gauge a = 0 if the mandelstam-leibbrandt formalism [4, 5] with the vector boson
propagator

is used. in eq. (1) either m 2

i = 0.
the function f involves the numerators of all propagators and all vertices with the
necessary -functions, that include the external momenta pk (the same expression without
the -functions is a polynomial, which we denote by f). we assume for the diagram f
and for all of its subdiagrams that the conditions

2 6= 0, where mi is the particle mass, or m 2

k < 0,

+ < 0,

(3)

hold, where + is the index of divergence w.r.t. q+ at qi
 6= 0 i, and k is the index
of divergence in q+ and q (simultaneously); q = 12 (q0  q3). the diagrams that
do not meet these conditions should be examined separately for each particular theory
(their number is usually nite). we seek the dierence between the value of integral
(1) obtained by the lorentz-covariant calculation and its value calculated in light-front
coordinates (light-front calculation).

in the light-front calculation, one introduces and then removes the light-front cuto

this case, we assume that we do not take the limit, but take the sum of all nonpositive

statement 2 from appendix i can be used. this results in the equality

from here on, the momenta of the lines qi are assumed to be expressed in terms of the

then we substitute (7) into (6). due to the exponentials that cut o qk

in appendix 2, it is shown that in (8) the limits in  and  can be interchanged, in turn,

with the integration over {i}, and then with f (cid:16)i 
yi(cid:17). after that, a comparison of
relations (8), (9) and (10), (11), clearly shows that f = fcov. considering (6) and using

3. reduction of the dierence between the light-front and

lorentz-covariant feynman integrals to a sum of congurations

let us introduce a partition for each line,

we call a line with integration w.r.t. the momentum qi
in the range (, ) (before

removing -functions) a type-1 line, a line with integration in the range (,)(,)
a type-2 line, and a line with integration over the whole range (,) a full line. in
the diagrams, they are denoted as shown in figs. la, b, and c, respectively.

let us substitute partition (13) into expression (4) for flf and open the brackets.
among the resulting terms, there is fcov (expression (12)). we call the remaining terms
diagram congurations and denote them by fj. then we arrive at the relation flf

note that before taking the limit in , eqs. (12) and (14) can be used successfully:
rst, they are applied to a subdiagram and, then, are substituted into the formula for the
entire diagram. this is admissible because, after the deformation of the contours described
in the proof of statement 1 from appendix 1, the integral over the loop momenta {qk
+} of
the subdiagram converges (after integration over the variables {qk
} of this subdiagram)
absolutely and uniformly with respect to the remaining loop momenta {qk
}. therefore,
one can interchange the integrals over {qk
thus, the dierence between the light-front and lorentz-covariant calculations of the
diagram is given by the sum of all of its congurations. a conguration of a diagram is
the same diagram, but where each line is labeled as a full or type-1 line, provided that at
least one type-1 line exists.

}.

4. behavior of the conguration as   0

we assume that all external momenta ps are xed for the diagram in question and

ps

 6= 0, xs

ps
 6= 0,

(15)

where the summation is taken over any subset of external momenta; all of these momenta
are assumed to be directed inward.

let us consider an arbitrary conguration. we apply the term -line to all type-1
lines and those full lines for which integration over q actually does not expand outside
the domain (r, r), where r is a nite number (below, we explain when these lines
appear). the remaining full lines are called -lines. in the diagrams, the -lines and -
lines are denoted as shown in figs. 1d and e, respectively. note that the diagram can be
drawn with lines a and c from fig. 1 (this denes the conguration unambiguously),
or with lines d and e (then the conguration is not uniquely dened).

if among the lines arriving at the vertex only one is full and the others are type-1
lines, this full line is an -line by virtue of the momentum conservation at the vertex. the
remaining full lines form a subdiagram (probably unconnected). by virtue of conditions
(15), there is a connected part to which all of the external lines are attached. all of the
external lines of the remaining connected parts are -lines. consequently, using state-
ment 1 from appendix 1, we can see that integration over the internal momenta of these
connected parts can be carried out in a domain of order  in size, i.e., all of their internal
lines are -lines. thus, an arbitrary conguration can be drawn as in fig. 2 and integral
(14), with the corresponding integration domain, is associated with it.

let us investigate the behavior of the conguration as   0. from here on, it is

convenient to represent the propagator as

z(q)

, where

z(q) = z(q) or z(q) =

expression 1/(2q + i/q+) (eq. (16)), which is related to the -line, is equal to -1. we

let us show that if it diverges with a degree of divergence , the contribution to the
initial integral is proportional to  up to logarithmic corrections. to this end, we
divide the domain of integration over ql
+ into two regions: u1, which lies inside a
sphere of radius / ( is xed), and u2, which lies outside this sphere (recall that in
our reasoning, we deal with each sector separately). now we estimate (18) (like (19)) in

(20)

after  is factored out of the numerator and the volume element, the integrand becomes
independent of . thus, the integral converges.

one can choose such  (independent of ) that the contribution from the domain u2
is smaller in absolute value than the contribution from the domain u1. consequently, the
whole integral can he estimated via the integral over the nite domain u1. now we make
an inverse replacement in (20) and estimate (19) by a constant (as above). since the size
of the integration domain is / and the degree of divergence is , the integral behaves
as  (up to logarithmic corrections), q.e.d. this reasoning is valid for each sector and,
thus, for the conguration as a whole. obviously,

(21)

where r is the subdiagram divergence index and the maximum is taken over all subdia-
grams dr (including unconnected subdiagrams for which r is the sum of the divergence
indices of their connected parts). in the case under consideration, r = r
+ + r, where
r is the number of internal -lines in the subdiagram dr. the quantities r
are the uv

divergence indices of the subdiagram dr w.r.t. q.

above, we introduced a quantity  , which is equal to the power of  that stems
from the numerators and volume elements of the entire conguration. we can write  =
r
r +r +r, where r is the index of the uv divergence in q of a smaller subdiagram

9

(probably, a tree subdiagram or a nonconnected one) consisting of -lines entering dr.
the term r is the power of  in the common factor, which, during transformation (17),
stems from the volume elements and numerators of the lines that did not enter dr. (it
is implied that the integration momenta are chosen in the same way as when calculating
the divergence indices of dr.) then, up to logarithmic corrections, we have

fj  ,

(22)

consequently, for   0, the conguration is equal to zero if  > 0. relation (22) allows
all essential congurations to be distinguished.

5. correction procedure and analysis of counter-terms

lf with the cuto |qi

we want to build a corrected light-front hamiltonian h cor

| > ,
which would generate greens functions that coincide in the limit   0 with covari-
ant greens functions within the perturbation theory. we begin with a usual canonical
hamiltonian in the light-front coordinates hlf with the cuto |qi
| > . we imply that the
integrands of the feynman diagrams derived from this light-front hamiltonian coincide
with the covariant integrands after some resummation [1, 2, 3]. however, a dierence may
arise due to the various methods of doing the integration, e.g., due to dierent auxiliary
regularizations. as shown in sec. 3, this dierence (in the limit   0) is equal to the
sum of all properly arranged congurations of the diagram. one should add such cor-
recting counter-terms to hlf, which generates additional counter-term diagrams, that
reproduce nonzero (after taking limit w.r.t. ) congurations of all of the diagrams. were
we able to do this, we would obtain the desired h cor
in fact, we can only show how
to seek the h cor
that generates the greens functions coinciding with the covariant ones
everywhere except the null set in the external momentum space (dened by condition
(15)). however, this restriction is not essential because this possible dierence does not
aect the physical results.

lf

.

our correction procedure is similar to the renormalization procedure. we assume that
the perturbation theory parameter is the number of loops. we carry out the correction
by steps: rst, we nd the counterterms to the hamiltonian that generate all nonzero
congurations of the diagrams up to the given order and, then, pass to the next order.
we take into account that this step involves the counter-term diagrams that arose from
the counter-terms added to the hamiltonian for lower orders. thus, at each step, we
introduce new correcting counter-terms that generate the dierence remaining in this
order. let us show how to successfully look for the correcting counter-terms.

we call a conguration nonzero if it does not vanish as   0. we call a nonzero
conguration primary if  is a tree subdiagram in it (see fig. 2). note that for this
conguration, breaking any -line results in a violation of conditions (15); then, the
resulting diagram is not a conguration. we say that the conguration is changed if all
of the -lines in the related integral (14) are expanded in series in  (see the reasoning
above eq. (18) in sec. 4) and only those terms that do not vanish in the limit   0 after

10

the integration are retained. as mentioned above, developing this series and integration
are interchangeable operations. thus, in the limit   0, the changed and unchanged
congurations coincide. therefore, we always require that the hamiltonian counter-terms
generate changed congurations, as this simplies the form of the counter-terms. using
additional terms in the hamiltonian, one can generate only counter-term diagrams, which
are equal to zero for external momenta meeting the condition |ps
| < , because with the
cuto used (see the introduction), the external lines of the diagrams do not carry momenta
with |ps
we seek counter-terms by the induction method. it is clear that, in the rst order
in the number of loops, all nonzero congurations are primary. we add the counter-
terms that generate them to the hamiltonian. now, we examine an arbitrary order of
perturbation theory. we assume that in lower orders, all nonzero congurations that can
be derived from the counter-terms, accounting for the above comment, have already been
generated by the hamiltonian.

| < . we bear this in mind in what follows.

let us proceed to the order in question. first, we examine nonzero congurations
with only one loop momentum k and a number of momenta q (see the notation above
eq. (17)). we break the conguration lines one by one without touching the other lines
(so that the ends of the broken lines become external lines). the line break may result in
a structure that is not a conguration (if conditions (15) are violated); a line break may
also result in a zero conguration or in a nonzero conguration. if the rst case is realized
for each broken line, then the initial conguration is primary and it must be generated
by the counter-terms of the hamiltonian in the order under consideration. if breaking of
each line results in either the rst or the second case, we call the initial conguration real
and it must be also generated in this order.

assume that breaking a line results in the third case. this means that the resulting
conguration stems from counter-terms in the lower orders. then, after restoration of the
broken line (i.e., after the appropriate integration), it turns out that the counter-terms
of the lower orders have generated the initial conguration (we take into account the
comment on successive application of eq. (14); see the end of sec. 3) with the following
distinctions: (i) the broken line (and, probably, some others, if a nonsimply connected
diagram arises after breaking the line) is not a -line but a type-2 line, due to the condi-
tions |ps
| > ; (ii) if, after restoration of the broken line, the behavior at small  becomes
worse (i.e.,  decreased), then fewer terms than are necessary for the initial conguration
were considered in the above-mentioned series in . we expand these arising type-2 lines
by formula (13) and obtain a term where all of these lines are replaced by -lines or other
terms where some (or all) of these lines have become type-1 lines. in the latter case, one
of the momenta q becomes the momentum k. we call these terms repeated parts of the
conguration and analyze them together with the congurations that have two momenta
k. in the former case, we obtain the initial conguration up to distinction (ii). we add
a counter-term to the hamiltonian that compensates this distinction (the counter-term
diagrams generated by it are called the compensating diagrams).

if there is only one line for which the third case is realized, it turns out that, in the
given order, it is not necessary to generate the initial conguration by the counter-terms,

11

except for the compensating addition and the repeated part that is considered at the next
step. if there are several lines for which the third case is realized, the initial conguration
is generated in lower orders more than once. for compensation, it should be generated
(with the corresponding numerical coecient and the opposite sign) by the hamiltonian
counter-terms in the given order. we call this conguration a secondary one. next, we
proceed to examine congurations with two momenta k and so on up to congurations
with all momenta k, which are primary congurations.

thus, the congurations to be generated by the hamiltonian counter-terms can be
primary (not only the initial primary congurations but also the repeated parts analogous
to them, called primary-like), real, compensating, and secondary. if the theory does not
produce either the loop consisting only of lines with q+ in the numerator (accounting
n in the numerator for n > 1, then
for contributions from the vertices) or a line with q+
real congurations are absent because a line without q+ in the numerator can always be
broken without increasing  (see eq. (22)). it is not dicult to demonstrate that if each
appearing primary, real, and compensating conguration has only two external line, then
there are no secondary congurations at all.

the dependence of the primary conguration on external momenta becomes trivial
if its degree of divergence  is positive, the maximum in formula (21) is reached on
the diagram itself, and  = 0. then, only the rst term is taken into account in the
above-mentioned series. thus, not all of the -line-related propagators and vertex factors
depend on km

into an easily obtained common factor.

6. application to the yukawa model

the yukawa model involves diagrams that do not satisfy condition (3). these are
displayed in figs. 3a and b. we have k = 0 for diagram a and + = 0 for diagram

fig. 3: yukawa model diagrams that do not meet condition (3).

nevertheless, these diagrams can be easily included in the general scheme of reasoning.
to this end, one should subtract the divergent part, independent of external momenta,
in the integrand of the logarithmically divergent (in two-dimensional space, with xed
internal transverse momenta) diagram a. we obtain an expression with k < 0 (i.e.,
which converges in two-dimensional space) and + = 0, as in diagram b. this means
that the integral over q+ converges only in the sense of the principal value (and it is
this value of the integral that should be taken in the light-front coordinates to ensure
agreement with the stationary noncovariant perturbation theory). this value can be
obtained by distinguishing the q+-even part of the integrand.

two approaches are possible. one is to introduce an appropriate regularization in
transverse momenta and to imply integration over them; then, it is convenient to dis-
tinguish the part that is even in four-dimensional momenta q. the other is to keep all
transverse momenta xed; then, the part that is even in longitudinal momenta qk can be
released. for the yukawa theory, we use the rst approach. for the transverse regular-
ization, we use a smearing of vertices, which is equivalent to dividing each propagator
2. in four-dimensional space, diagram a diverges quadratically. under
by 1 + qi

introduction and subsequent removal of the transverse regularization, the divergent part,
which was previously subtracted from this diagram, acquires the form c1 + c2 p2


after separating the even part of the regularized expression, we x all of the transverse
momenta again. then it turns out that diagrams a and b in fig. 3 meet conditions
(3) and one can show that after all of the operations mentioned, the exponent  (see
(22)) does not decrease for any of their congurations. hence, they can be included in
the general scheme without any additional corrections.

.

let us rst analyze the primary congurations (see the denition in sec. 5). in the
numerators, k appears only in the zero or one power and there are no loops where the
numerators of all of the lines contain k. consequently, one always has  > 0, r  0,
and r  0 (see the denitions in sec. 4). analyzing the properties of the expression
r
  r
+ for the yukawa model diagrams, we conclude from (22) that   0 always holds.
the general form of the nonzero primary congurations with  = 0 is depicted in fig. 4.
note that they are all congurations with two external line.

further, it is clear that there are no nonzero real congurations (see the comment at the
end of sec. 5), and it can be shown by induction that there are no nonzero compensating
or secondary congurations either (the denitions are given in sec. 5 also). thus, only

fig. 4: nonzero congurations in the yukawa model: p is the external momentum, and +
or  symbols on the line indicate that the corresponding term is taken in the numerator
of the propagator. in conguration b, the part that is proportional to + is taken.

primary or primary-like congurations can be nonzero and all of them have the form
shown in fig. 4. it can be shown that their degree of divergence  is positive and the
maximum in formula (21) is reached for the diagram itself. thus, the reasoning above
and below formula (23) applies to them. then, denoting the congurations displayed
in figs. 4a-d by da  dd, we arrive at the equalities da = +
cb, dc = cc
p
and dd = cd, where the expressions ca  cd depend only on the masses and transverse
momenta, but not on the external longitudinal momenta, and have a nite limit as   0.
now we assume that da  dd are not single congurations but are the sums of all con-
gurations of the same form and that integration over the internal transverse momenta has
already been carried out, (with the above-described regularization). in four-dimensional
space, the diagrams da and db diverge linearly while dc and dd diverge quadratically.
therefore, because of the transverse regularization, the coecients cc and cd in the
limit for removing this regularization take the form c1 + c2 p2
, where c1 and c2 do not

depend on the external momenta (neither do ca, cb)). thus, to generate all nonzero
congurations by the light-front hamiltonian, only the expression

ca, db = +
p

hc = c1 2 + c2 p2


2 + c3



+
p

,

(24)

should be added, where  and  are the boson and fermion elds, respectively, and ci,
are the constant coecients.

comparing (24) with the initial canonical light-front hamiltonian, one can easily see
that the found counter-terms are reduced to a renormalization of various terms of the
hamiltonian (in particular the boson mass squared and the fermion mass squared with-
out changing the fermion mass itself). the explicit lorentz invariance is absent, which
compensates the violation of the lorentz invariance inherent, in the light-front formalism.
note that in the framework of the second approach, mentioned at the beginning of this
section, one can obtain the same results. the only dierence is that in two-dimensional
space, the contributions from the congurations displayed in fig. 3 would additionally
depend on external transverse momenta. however, this dependence disappears after inte-
gration over internal transverse momenta with the introduction and subsequent removal

14

of an appropriate regularization.

in the pauli villars regularization, it is easy to verify that the expression r

+ 
r + r from (22) increases. this is because the number of terms in the numerators of the
propagator increases. then, the contribution from the -lines does not change, while the
-lines belonging to dr make zero contribution to r
+ and r, but 1 contribution
to r. since  > 0, this regularization makes it possible to meet the condition  > 0
for the congurations that were nonzero (one additional boson eld and one additional
fermion eld are enough). then it turns out that the canonical light-front hamiltonian
cannot be corrected at all.

7. application to gauge theories

let us consider a gauge theory (e.g., qed or qcd) in the gauge a = 0. the boson

propagator in the mandelstam-leibbrandt prescription has the form

all of the above reasoning was organized such that it could be applied to a theory like this
(with xed transverse momenta q 6= 0). it turns out that there are nonzero congura-
tions with arbitrarily large numbers of external lines. an example of such a conguration
is given in fig. 5.

fig. 5: nonzero conguration with an arbitrarily large number of external lines in a gauge
theory. the symbols  on the lines and the symbols + or  by the vertices indicate that
the corresponding terms + or + are taken in the numerators of propagators and in the
vertex factors.

indeed, using formula (22), we can see that for the conguration in fig. 5,  = 0 and,
thus,   0, i.e., this is a nonzero conguration. it is also clear that introduction of the
pauli-villars regularization does not improve the situation because it does not aect  .
thus, within the framework of the above-described method for correcting the canonical
light-front hamiltonian of the gauge theory, an innite number of counter-terms must be
added to the hamiltonian. note, however, that the formulated conditions for the vanishing
of the conguration are sucient, but, generally speaking, not necessary. because of this

15

and because of the possible cancellation of dierent congurations after integration w.r.t.
transverse momenta, the number of necessary counter-terms may be smaller.

clamping of the contour or the point qi


let us investigate the rst alternative. we divide the domain of integration over qk
+
into sectors such that the momenta of all full lines qi
+ have a constant sign within one
sector. let us examine one sector. we take a set of full lines whose qi
may simultaneously

vanish. in the vicinity of the point where qi
from this set vanish simultaneously, we bend

the contours of the integration over {qk

easy to check that this bending is possible. (since the contours of integration over qk

are bent and qi

where the necessary bi are expressed in the same way, i.e., that bi obey the conservation
laws and ow only along the full lines). with this bending, rather small in relation to the
deviation and the size of the deviation region, the contours do not pass through the poles
because, for the denominator of each line from the set in question, we have

and for the other denominators, the bending takes place in a region separated from the
point where the corresponding momenta qi

all sets, we can see that there is no contour clamping.

after bending the contours, integral (a.1.2) is absolutely convergent in qk

now let us prove that if b is a quite small, nite vicinity of the point {qk

the other alternative is excluded by the above condition for b. to make this clear, one
should introduce such coordinates  in the qk-space that the boundary of the domain b
is determined by the equation 1 = a = const and then argue as above for the coordinates
 with   2.
if tlie
integration in qk
+ is carried out within the sector under consideration. on pointing out
that the result, of internal integration in (a.1.2) does not depend on the bending, we add
the integrals over all sectors and conclude that (a.1.2) converges in {qk
} that
lies outside the sphere bl, then expression (a.1.2) is equal to zero. we consider the
momentum qi
of one line. flowing along the diagram, it can ramify or it can merge

with other momenta. clearly, two situations are possible: either it ows away completely
through external lines, or, probably, after long wandering, part of it, q, makes a complete
loop. the former situation is possible only if |qi
|, where all external momenta
leaving the diagram (but not entering it) are summed. obviously, s can be chosen such
that for {qk

loop. then the integral over qk

the latter situation results in the existence of a loop, where the inequality qi

integrals over {qk

residue formula can be used to perform this integration. since, for the loop in question,
the momenta qi
of the lines of this loop are separated from zero and are of the same

sign, the result is zero. this has a simple physical meaning.
if we pass to stationary
noncovariant perturbation theory, we nd that only quanta with positive q can exist.
in this case, external particles with positive p are incoming and those with negative p
are outgoing. then, the momentum conservation law favors the occurrence of the rst
situation.

the entire outside space for b can be composed of the above domains bl (everything

of (a.1.1), one can substitute the integration domain v  bl for v, set the limit in 
under the sign of integration over {qk

the limit in  under the integration sign because the domain of the integration over {qk

is bounded. thus, we obtain the right-hand side. the statement is proved.

i,

i.e., a limit on the integrated function arises, and, thus, the limit in  can be put under
the integral sign. the situation is similar for case (ii). it is evident from (a.2.1) that the
function  can be singular only if the eigenvalues of matrix a become zero. on nding
the lower bound of these eigenvalues, one can prove through rather long reasoning that
bounds (a.2.2), (a.2.3) exist if condition (3) is satised.

after the limits in  and  are put under the integral sign, it is not dicult to
interchange them with the dierentiation with respect to y . one need do it only for
i > 0 (for each i) and, in this case, one can show that the eigenvalues of the matrix a
are nonzero and  is not singular.
