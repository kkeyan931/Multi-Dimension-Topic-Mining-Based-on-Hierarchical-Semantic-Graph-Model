abstract

it is pointed out that the mersenne primes mp = (2p  1) and associated

perfect numbers mp = 2p1mp play a signicant role in string theory; this

observation may suggest a classication of consistent string theories.

anomalies and their avoidance have provided a guidepost in constraining viable particle

physics theories. from the standard model to superstrings, the importance of nding models

where the concelation of local and global anomalies that spoil local invariance properties

of theories, and hence render them inconsistent, cannot be overestimated. the fact that

anomalous thories can be dropped from contention has made progress toward the true theory

of elementary particles proceed at an enormously accelerated rate. here we take up a

systematic search, informed by previous results and as yet partially understood connections

to number theory, for theories free of leading gauge anomalies in higher dimensions. we will

nd new cases and be able to place previous results in perspective.

in number theory a very important role is played by the mersenne primes mp based on

the formula

mp = 2p  1

(1)

where p is a prime number. mp is sometimes itself a prime number. the rst 33 such

mersenne primes correspond [13] to prime numbers below one million:

p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281,

3217, 4253, 4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209, 44497,

86243, 110503, 132049, 216091, 756839, 859433.

(2)

as a comparison to this remarkable sequence of the rst 33 mersenne primes, there are

altogether 78498 primes below one million so that eq.(1), although an invaluable source of

large prime numbers, far more often generates a composite number than a prime.

on the occasion that eq.(1) does generate a prime, an immediate derivative thereof is the

perfect number which we shall designate mp given by mp = 2p1mp. it is straightforward

and pleasurable to prove in general that mp is perfect, dened as mp equalling the sum of

all of its divisors. for example, m2 = 6 = 1 + 2 + 3, m3 = 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14, and

so on. the mp are the only even perfect numbers; it is unknown if there is an odd perfect

number but if there is one it is known [4] that it is larger than 10300.

2

in the present letter, we shall associate the perfect numbers derived from mersenne

primes with the polygonal anomalies whose cancellation underlies the successful string the-

ories.

for example, heterotic and type-i superstrings in ten dimensions are selected to have

gauge groups o(32) and e(8)  e(8) on the basis of anomaly cancellation of the hexagon

anomaly [58]. equivalently, these two superstrings correspond to the only self-dual lattices

in 16 dimensions: 8 l 8 and 16 [9]. the dimension of these two acceptable gauge groups
in d = 10 is dim(g) = 496 = m5, indeed a perfect number of the mersenne sequence.

further motivation in low dimensions for consideration of the perfect number comes from

[10] m3 the so(8) and g2  g2 supergravities in 6 dimensions for m3 , from noting that

0(4) and su(2)  su(2) are anomaly free in four dimensions for m2 and from the existence

of an n = 2 world sheet supersymmetric string theory in 2 dimensions [11]with gauge group

so(2)  u(1) for m1.

the appropriate polygon for spacetime dimension d is the lagon where l = ( d

2 + 1).

one way to discover the signicance of mp and mp in string theory is to recognize

that the leading lagon anomaly for a k-rank tensor of su(n) or o(n) is given [5,7] by a

generalized eulerian number ( the eulerian numbers are an (n, k))

our purpose here is to investigate the space-time dimensions corresponding to the

mersenne primes d = 2p for gauge group irreps with vanishing leading gauge anomalies.

one could then cancel the nonleading anomalies in the green-schwarz mechanism to gen-

erate a candidate string theory or supergravity (a complete theory must also avoid all local

gravitational and global anomalies).

since all the primes except 2 are odd, the mersenne prime dimensions (mpds) are

d = 4n+2, where n is an integer except for the special case d = 4. a thorough investigation

of the mpds returns the following for d between 4 and 26 and certain higher values:

3

d = 4 is well studied in the literature, to which we refer the reader [13].

d = 6 (p = 3): expressing antisymmetric tensor irreps by [1]k we again nd anomaly

freedom for the second rank antisymmetric tensor k = 2 when n = 8 for gauge groups

su(8) or so(8). for su(n) one expects the conjugate solution [1]n k = [1]82 = [1]6,

which is nothing new, but due to its low order, the anomaly polynomial factorizes at [1]6

to (n  6)(n  27), implying a nonvanishing anomaly of [1]6 for su(27) [and for so(27)].

this in turn implies a [1]n k = [1]276 = [1]21 solution, which one nds at n = 98. this

sequence continues, (see table 1) (we remind the reader that for su(n), [1]n k and [1]k

are complex irreps except when k = n/2 and n is even where [1]n/2 is a real irrep. for

so(n), [1]k is real for k < n/2. when k = n/2, [1]k splits. the components are real if

n/2 is even and they are a complex conjuate pair if n/2 is odd.there are added subtlities

for so(8) because of triality [13].)

d = 10. as with d = 6 we nd a [1]2 solution when n = 2p = 32. there are two

further solutions, up to conjugation k = 4 with n = 12, and k = 10 with n = 32, and no

others with k  40. (in what follows we do a study of all cases out to k = 40, unless noted

otherwise.)

d = 14: the only solution is k = 2 for n = 128.

the case where p = 13 deserves special consideration, since it corresponds to 26 dimen-

sions, and a 26d theory with so(213) = so(8192) has indeed already been considered in the

literature [1416]. in [14], the single dilaton emission amplitude from a disk world sheet was

calculated and used in a proof that the total dilaton emission amplitude (from the projective

plane plus the disk [17]) at this order vanishes in 26d for so(8192). furthermore, it has

been shown [15] that the one-loop divergences are avoided by so(8192) open strings in 26d.

a general understanding has been provided [16] of the chan-paton factors forso(2d/2) in

terms of d added fermionic variables at the ends of open strings, and this is useful input

into developing the partition function for the so(8192) open string [16].

likewise,

the only solution is k = 2 for n = 2p, with d = 2p =

34, 38, 62, 178, 214, 254, 1042, 1214, 2558 and 4406, where we have searched through k = 40

except for d = 1042, where k  24, d = 2558 where k  10, and d = 4406 where k  8.

for the sake of completeness, we have also studied the remaining even dimensions below

d = 26, with no mersenne prime correspondence. as before, k = 2 with n = 2p is always

a solution, and when d = 4n (n integer),

k = n/2 is also a solution as expected since it is real. (recall that real representations

have no anomalies in d = 4n dimensions, but do in d = 4n + 2, therefore anomaly freedom

for [1]k irreps is trivial in d = 4n for so groups, but not for su groups.)

d = 8: we nd the usual k = 2 and k = n/2 solutions, plus two more sequences, one

starting with k = 2, d = 16, and the other with k = 3, d = 27(see table 1).

d = 12: has only k = 2 and k = n/2 solutions.

d = 16: has the usual k = 2 and k = n/2 solutions, plus at k = 3 with n = 27 and

also at k = 3 with n = 486.

d = 18, 20, 22 and 24 have nothing new beyond the usual solutions, of k = 2 and k =

n  2 for su(n p) with p = d/2, and for d = 4n the trivial case of the real representation

k = n/2 for any su(n).

this completes the classication.

returning to d = 8, the [1]3 = 2925 of su(27) or so(27) is anomaly free, but also the

[1]3 of e6 is a 2925 under the decomposition su(27)  e6, where 27  27. since the

generalized casimir invariants of e6 are of rank 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 12, leading anomalies are

expected at d = 2, 8, 20, 14, 16, and 22. [18]. however, the 2925 is an exception since it is

real.

in d = 6 no leading e6 anomalies are expected, and we nd the k = 6, n = 27 result

corresponding to the [1]6 = 296010 irrep of su(27) or so(27) is reducible in e6.

in d = 16 for k = 3 and n = 27, leading e6 anomalies are voided by the 2925.

the higher n exotic solutions have no obvious origins in exceptional groups.

our ndings are also summarized in table 1.

given the well established signicance of m5 in spacetime dimension d = 10 for the two

heterotic strings so(32) and e8  e8 we are led to observe that for k = 2 (dimensionality

mp) of so(2p) in spacetime dimensions d = 2p for any of the mersenne primes, as well as

the other particular cases listed in our table 1, the leading polygonal anomaly ((p + 1)-agon)

is cancelled. with the possibility that the non-leading anomalies are also cancelled, we are

naturally led to speculate that there exist consistent string theories, beyond those presently

established, in the spacetime dimensions and involving the particular gauge groups to which

we have been led.

this speculation, if veried, will provide one more link between number theory, particu-

larly the mersenne primes, and string theory.
