we consider domain walls that appear in supersymmetric qcd with nf < nc massive avours.
in particular, for 2nf < nc we explicitly construct the domain walls that interpolate between vacua
labeled by i and i + nf . we show that these solutions are bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld (bps)
saturated for any value of the mass of the matter elds. this fact allows us to evaluate the large mass
limit of these domain walls. we comment on the relevance of these solutions for supersymmetric
gluodynamics.

in recent times, a lot of attention has been drawn to
the existence of exact solutions in supersymmetric gauge
theories that are in the strong coupling regime. one of
the more relevant issues is that of domain walls in su(n)
supersymmetric gluodynamics, the theory of gluons and
gluinos. those arise because this theory has an axial
u(1) symmetry broken by the anomaly to a discrete z2n
chiral symmetry. due to non-perturbative eects gluino
condensates (hi) form, breaking the symmetry further
down to z2. this leaves us with a set of n dierent vacua
labelled by

htri = 3e2ik/n k = 0, 1, ..., n  1 ,

(1)

where  is the condensation scale, and, as indicated
above, a set of domain walls interpolating between them
(in ref. [1] it was pointed out the existence of a chirally
symmetric vacuum where the gaugino condensate van-
ishes. here we will only consider domain walls involving
chirally asymmetric vacua). if we asume that they are
bps saturated, the energy density of these walls is ex-
actly calculable and given by [25]

 =

n
82 |htri  htri| ,

(2)

in fact, it has been suggested in ref. [6] that, in the large
n limit, these domain walls are bps states. on the other
hand, these solutions preserving half of the supersymme-
try would play an important role in the d-brane descrip-
tion of n = 1 sqcd [7]. however, we want to stress that
whether or not these congurations were bps saturated
was, up to now, still an open question [5].

a useful way of gaining intuition on pure gluodynamics
is by adding matter elds and analyzing the limit where
these extra elds become very heavy. these new elds

are usually taken to be pairs of chiral superelds trans-
forming as (n, n ) under the color group. in the strong
coupling regime, squark condensates will thefore form.
these models, for the case of (n  1) avours, were con-
sidered in refs [811], where the analysis of the vacuum
structure led the authors to conclude that the existence
of bps saturated domain walls was restricted to values
for the mass m of the squark elds below a certain critical
one. this jeopardized the idea of recovering pure gluo-
dynamics by taking the limit m  , which is precisely
the issue we want to revise here.

in order to do that let us consider supersymmetric
qcd with su (nc) gauge group and nf couples of chi-
ral superelds (qi, qi) transforming as nc, nc. non-
perturbative eects become relevant at the scale , where
condensates form. the gaugino and squark colorless con-
densates are described by the following composite elds

s =

m i

j = qi qj

i, j = 1, 2, ..., nf ,

(3)

where w 2 is the composite chiral supereld whose low-
est component is . in this regime, the relevant degrees
of freedom are described by a wess-zumino model, as
shown in ref. [12]. its eective langrangian is given by

will work in the avour basis where this matrix is diago-
nal, and will use the notation mj

lyze the simple case where the corresponding eigenvalues
are real. this superpotential has nc extrema labeled by
the dierent phases of the gaugino condensate. at the
minimum we have the gaugino condensate xed to

let us analyze the simplest case where the masses mi are
degenerate. we will assume symmetric boundary condi-
tions for the matter elds. to be more precise, we will
consider wi = 1 (and therefore k = nf ) for the path
drawn by the domain wall. we can then assume that
all the matter condensates have the same z dependence.
then the conguration is described by four real functions

i (z) = |m| (z)ei(z) ,

s(z) = |s| r(z)ei(z) .

notice that we have dened (z), r(z) in such a way
that () = r() = 1. on the other hand,  varies
from 0 to 2(nf /nc  1) and  from 0 to 2nf /nc. a
consistent ansatz under reection z  z is given by:
(z) = (z), r(z) = r(z), (z) = 2 nf
 (z) and

eqs (11) imply the following bps constraint

im(cid:2)eiw(s, m i

i )(cid:3) = const .

in particular, at z = 0 we have

(14)

(15)

(16)

= nc cos(cid:18)

nf

nc(cid:19) ,

where r0 = r(0) and 0 = (0).

the case with nf = nc  1 has already been con-
sidered for su (2) [8,9], su (3) [10], and generalized to
arbitrary su (n ) in [11,14]. since k = nc  1, the corre-
sponding domain walls connect a minimun and its nearest
neighbour. in these papers it was shown that these do-
main walls are bps states only for squark masses lower
than some critical value, m, that depends on nc and
the kahler potential. the existence of this bound is re-
lated to the presence of two dierent bps domain wall
solutions for small enough values of m, which became
identical at the critical value.

we want to study domain wall congurations that in-
terpolate between the dierent minima. here a technical
problem appears: the superpotential has several branches
associated with its logarithmic piece [13].
in the pure
susy gluodynamics limit described by veneziano and
yankielowicz [12] this is a severe problem, since any con-
guration going from one vacuum to another has to cross
this branch. this is not necessarily the case when we in-
clude other elds, given that the variation in the phase of
the gaugino condensate can be partially compensated by
these new elds. in this case, this will be done by matter
elds.

let (s, m )a be a particular vacuum. we can continu-
ously deform it into another vacuum, (s, m )b. for this
path in the conguration space, we dene , wi such that

s|b = eis|a ,

since, as mentioned above, matter at the minimum has
to be aligned with respect to the gaugino condensate,
wi must be some integer numbers. on the other hand,
one necessary condition to avoid crossing the logarithmic
branch along this general path is

(nc  nf ) +xi

( + 2wi) = 0 ,

(10)

, where k is the integer given by

and then  = 2 k
nc

k = pi wi.

if we assume that there is a bps domain wall connect-
ing these two vacua from z =  to z = +, it will be
described by the following dierential equations

m i

i |b = ei(+2wi)m i

i |a , i = 1, ..., nf .

(dotted line), 20 (dash-dotted), 100 (dashed), 200 (solid).

we have done a similar analysis for other values of nf ,
using the same kahler potential , i.e. k = (s s)1/3 +
(m m )1/2. here we have worked in detail the case
nc = 3, nf = 1, whereas other cases will be presented
elsewhere [15]. we have found that the equations can
be solved for all values of the squark mass, and we have
checked that the logarithmic branch is never crossed. the
proles for  and r are shown in figs 1,2 for several val-
ues of m (given in units of ), focusing on their central
region. the spatial coordinate z is expressed in units of
1, where  = ( 3m
4 )nf /3nc is the eective qcd scale
that arises in the large m limit.

in our case there is only one bps solution for every
value of m. this can be understood analyzing both the
large and small m limit:

 when m <<  and ks s is non singular, we can inte-
grate out the gaugino condensate by imposing w/s =
0. the corresponding wess-zumino model describing the
matter condensate has a bps state with the required
boundary conditions for all values of nf < nc. in the
case analyzed by smilga and veselov [10,11], there is yet
another bps solution that cannot be described by inte-
grating s out and that corresponds to s  0. the exis-
tence of this domain wall is probably related to the fact
that the kahler metric ks s is singular at this value [16].
in this limit s  0, 0 can be derived from eq. (16), and
it is given by

r(z) as dened in eqs (13) versus z (in units of 1), for m = 2
(dotted line), 20 (dash-dotted), 100 (dashed), 200 (solid). the thick

solid line corresponds to the m   solution given by eq. (20).

 let us turn now to analyze large mass values, m >>
. from fig. 2 we see that there is a well dened gaug-
ino condensate prole in the m   limit. in fact, if we
assume that this limit exists, the following constraints
should apply in the asymptotic regions

(z)ei(z) = r(z)ei(z) (z << 1/m) ,

(z)ei(z) = r(z)ei((z)2) (z >> 1/m) .

for m = 2 (dotted line), 20 (dash-dotted), 100 (dashed), 200 (solid).

in our case, since nf /nc < 1/2, the resulting value for
0 is never positive and therefore we do not nd a second
branch of solutions to the bps equations.

in fig. 3 we have drawn the combination 1

2 ((z) 
(z)), conrming the previous statement; also a quick

3

glance at figs 1,2 tells us that both  and r follow iden-
tical paths in the asymptotic regions.

therefore, using eq. (18) in this large m limit we can
get rid of  and  in the bps equations. also the bps
constraint involves only the gaugino condensate and can
be written as

imnei(+ (z))r(z)hln(cid:16)r(z)ei (z)(cid:17)  1io = const ,

(19)

where (z) = (z) for z < 0 and (z) = (z)  2nf /nc
for z > 0. this constraint allows us to express  as a
function of r, and we end up with the following bps
equation for r(z)

zr(z) = 6nc(r(z))4/3 ncos( + [r(z)]) ln r(z)

 sin( + [r(z)]) [r(z)]o ,

(20)

together with the boundary condition at the origin cal-
culated from eq. (19), i.e.,

r0(1  ln r0) = cos(cid:18)

nf

nc(cid:19) .

(21)

as we can see from fig. 4, this equation has always a so-
lution with r0 > 1. there is also a solution with r0 < 1
when 2nf < nc. we have seen that only the case r0 < 1
gives a nite, domain wall like prole. we have also ver-
ied that the corresponding solution for r(z) is precisely
the large m limit prole, which is represented by a thick
solid line in fig. 2. therefore the condition ensuring that
there is just one branch of bps states at low m values
also guarantees the existence of the large m limit case.

in summary, it is possible to build bps domain walls
in sqcd with 2nf < nc, both in the weak coupling
(higgs) regime and in the strong coupling limit, where
the theory approaches pure supersymmetric gluodynam-
ics. when the kahler metric is non singular along the
dierent congurations the existence of these solutions
in the strong coupling regime can be understood by just
analyzing the superpotential, as in the cases we have just
shown.
