abstractthe self-dual chern-simons solitons under the inuence of the quantum po-
tential are considered. the single-valuedness condition for an arbitrary integer number
n  0 of solitons leads to quantization of chern-simons coupling constant  = m e2
g , and
the integer strength of quantum potential s = 1  m2. as we show, the jackiw-pi model
corresponds to the rst member (m = 1) of our hierarchy of the chern-simons gauged
nonlinear schrodinger models, admitting self-dual solitons. new type of exponentially
localized chern-simons solitons for the bloch electrons near the hyperbolic energy band
boundary are found.

1. introduction

the chern-simons theory attracted much attention recently as a gauge theory in 2+1
dimensions [1], describing non-local interaction between matter particles, aecting the
phase of the wave function, and leading to the fractional statistics phenomena [2]. in this
connection the chern-simons coupling constant plays the role of a statistical parameter
and relates to the spin of particles. at the classical non-relativistic level, with the chern-
simons coupling strength determined by overall strength of a quartic scalar potential, it
leads to the existence of the self-dual chern-simons solitons [3]. they are static solutions
with nite charge and ux of exactly solvable self-dual equations [4]. unfortunately, the
full dynamics of chern-simons solitons according to the nonlinear schrodinger equation is
still inexible due to the lack of exact integrability, even without external forces, although
it may be realized in the framework of the davey-stewartson-ii equation [5].

in the present paper we show that the external force produced by the so-called
quantum potential u (x) = (h2/2m)||/||, leads to an additional statistical trans-
mutation of chern-simons solitons. the quantum potential, introduced by l. de broglie
[6] and explored by d. bohm [7] does not depend on the strength of the wave but only on
its form, and therefore its eect could be large even at long distances. then, it satises
the homogeneity property [8], this is the reason why it appears in attempts of a nonlinear
extension of the quantum mechanics [9,11-14]. an approach has been developed to the

stochastic formulation of quantum mechanics, where the quantum uctuations are repre-
sented by superimposing a classical trajectory and an additional random motion generated
by quantum potential [10]. the nonlinear extension of the schrodinger equation with the
quantum potential non-linearity has been considered in connection with several problems
[11]: a) in allowing formally the diusion coecient of the stochastic process in a stochas-
tic quantization to dier h/2m, related to the dierence in the plank constant [12] or the
inertial mass [13], b) in corrections from quantum gravity [14]. as was shown by sabatier,
depending from intensity of the quantum potential it can be linearized in the form of
the schrodinger equation with rescaled potential or as the pair of time reversed diusion
equations [15], and in both cases does not admit soliton solutions. recently we nd that
for self-consistent potential u = g||2 in 1+1 dimensions the theory has soliton solutions
with rich resonance dynamics [16]. in the present paper we nd exactly soluble case for
2+1 dimensional nonlinear schrodinger (nls) model interacting with chern-simons eld
under the inuence of the quantum potential.

in the above mentioned interpretation of quantum mechanics the quantum particle
moves under the action of a force which along with classical potential includes a contribu-
tion from the quantum potential. if instead of classical particle we consider chern-simons
solitons, then subject to the inuence of intensity s quantum potential, it could represent
the stochastically quantized anyons. in this case we can expect quantization condition on
the chern-simons coupling constant, an aect on the anyonic parameter and the appear-
ance of the zero point uctuation for the statistical ux.

2. chern-simons solitons hierarchy

we consider the chern-simons gauged nonlinear schrodinger model (the jackiw-pi

model) with nonlinear quantum potential term of strength s:

l =

(2c)

as we mentioned in introduction the extension of the linear schrodinger equation with
s 6= 0 term has been considered before [11-14], and was linearized for any s [12]. but,
when one adds the nonlinear self-interaction and the gauge eld, integrability of the model
is allowed only under some restrictions on the coupling parameters. for s < 1, and this

(4c)

is only the case where we nd the self-duality condition, we decompose  = eris and
introduce new rescaled variables

t = (1  s)1/2t, s = (1  s)1/2 s,
a0 = (1  s) a0, a = (1  s)1/2 a.

(3)
then for new function  = exp(r  i s), we get the gauged nls system (the jackiw-pi
model)

aj  j a0 =

but with new coupling constants  = (1  s)1/2, g = g/(1  s). since invariance of the
density  =  =  , the gauss law (4b) modies the value of magnetic ux, which
depends now of s. only when the coupling constants are restricted by the condition

static solutions of the system (4) with the gauge potential

condition (5) extends for s 6= 0, the well-known jackiw-pi constraint. namely, self-duality
equations in the presence of quantum potential survive only if its strength is restricted by
s = 1  g22/e4.
get for the density  =  the liouville equation

to solve the system (6) we insert a from the rst equation to the second one and will

would be regular if n  1. then, like in [3], from regularity of the gauge potential a we
can x the phase of  = exp(r  i s) as s = (n  1),  = arctan x2/x1, and restrict n
to be an integer for single-valued . however, the auxiliary function  is not the physical
one, this is why xing an integer n is not sucient for single valuedness of the original
function  = exp(r  i(1  s)1/2(1  n )). it would be now that the phase is restricted
as 0 < s  2(1  s)1/2, and in general we have the problem with angular defect in the
plane 2(1  (1  s)1/2), describing a cone . it is easy to see to avoid this complication an
integer valued must be the product

valuedness of which for any integer n , requires an integer valuedness of

(1  s)1/2(n  1) = n,

and as the consequence of (5), we obtain the quantization condition

(1  s)1/2 = m,

g2
e2 = m,

(m = 1, 2, 3...).

(9)

(10)

(11)

the last one means that in the presence of quartic self-interaction the chern-simons cou-
pling constant and the quantum potential strength must be quantized

 = m

g

,

s = 1  m2.

(12)

when m = 1, the quantum potential vanishes, s = 0, while the rst constraint in (12)
reduces to the jackiw-pi self-dual condition. it is worth to note that in our relation (12)
g and  coupling constants play the role similar to ones in the electro-magnetic duality
condition derived by dirac.

the self-dual system (6) for original (, a) has the form, depending of the quantum

potential with a coecient proportional to the angular defect,

it shows that under the inuence of the quantum potential chern-
simons solitons continue to be a zero energy conguration. due to (9), and (10) the ux
for solution (8) is quantized

where n = 1, 2, 3, ... and value of m is xed. thus, the magnetic ux of our vortex/soliton
is an even multiple m of the elementary ux quantum, which generalizes the jackiw-pi
result related to the particular value m = 1. here it is worth to note that the single-
valuednes condition (9) may be satised also for particular real values for s and n . thus,
if (1  s)1/2 = p/q is the rational number, then single-valuedness of  is allowed only for
the specic sequence of integers n = 1, 1 + q, 1 + 2q, ... or n = 1 + ql, where l = 0, 1, 2....
in this case the ux is quantized as

 =

2
e

(2p)(l +

1
q

),

(16)

with 1/q playing the role of the zero-point ux. for an irrational value (1  s)1/2 =  the
ux is quantized

 =

2(n + ), (n = 0, 1, 2, ...),

(17)

2
e

only for the irrational sequence n = 1 + n/.

the decomposition  = exp(r is) is known in quantum mechanics as the madelung
uid representation and has been explored for description of superconductivity [18]. in the
problem (2) the velocity of associated madelung uid is denite as v = 2(s  ea) and
satises the conservation law
(18)

t + v = 0.

for the self-dual ows, from eq.(6a) we nd the canonical hamiltonian equations

x  v1 =


y

,

y  v2 = 


x

,

where the stream function , playing the role of a hamiltonian, has the form

 = (1  s)1/2 ln .

(19)

(20)

for the soliton solution (8), function  is regular everywhere and has 2(n  1) -th order
zero at the beginning of coordinates. this zero determines singularity of  and v, such
that near the singularity

 = 2(n  1)(1  s)1/2 ln r  


2

ln r,

(21)

and the ow corresponds to the line vortex, the strength of which according to (9) must
be quantized  = 4n = 4m(1  n ). the velocity eld near the center

v = 2n
r

(

),

(22)

is the gradient of multivalued function  = 2n arctan(y/x), which xes the value of
the phase of the wave function . as is well-known, functions  and  are conjugate
harmonic functions, providing holomorphicity condition for the gauge potential near the

5

center. the above consideration shows that chern-simons soliton can be interpreted as
a planar vortex in the madelung uid, having form of a linear vortex near the rotation
point. this interpretation allows us to give the physical meaning for the vortex ow in the
madelung quantum liquid and answer the question posed in [19].

3. exponentially localized chern-simons solitons

in previous section we considered self-duality reduction for s < 1. however, no solution
for s > 1 has been found. now we show that in a special case of hyperbolic energy surface
in the dynamics of bloch electrons under the inuence of chern-simons and quantum
potentials, the problem admits an exact treatment also for s > 1.
in the dynamics of
bloch electron in a solid a central role is played by the inverse eective mass tensor 1/m 
2/k2e(k), which is not necessary positive denite. when the fermi surface is near
the band boundary, the sign of the mass in orthogonal direction is negative.
in this
hyperbolic case, due to strong bragg reection from the boundary of the band, the electron
propagates along trajectories which are parallel to the planes of the lattice, and e(k) has
saddle points, where the curvature of the surface may be positive in one direction and
negative in another. for two-dimensional motion, in simplest case of the energy surface
e(k) = k2
2/2m, the eective mass matrix is m1 = diag(1/m, 1/m) and the
bloch electron subject to the lorentz force, imitated by chern-simons interaction, has
a dissipative character [20], with the constant magnetic eld playing the role of the
damping. then, in lagrangian (1) and equations of motion (2) we replace the positive
space metric ij = diag(1, 1) with the indenite one ij = diag(1, 1) as follows

t = (s  1)1/2t, s = (s  1)1/2 s,
a0 = (s  1) a0, a = (s  1)1/2 a,

(25)
and instead of  = exp(r  is), introduce two real functions q = exp(r  s), satisfying

where d =   ea. this system represents the gauged version of the pair time-reversal
invariant diusion equations with the reaction term proportional to q+q. it is worth
to note that switching on the chern-simons term leads to switching o the time-reversal
invariance without changing the geometry of the classical trajectories. moreover, instead of
the local phase transformations for the original model (23), in the system (26) the chern-
simons gauge eld corresponds to the local rescaling of q. for static congurations,
when a0 = (e/(s  1)1/2)q+q, and

(s  1)1/2 =

we have the self-duality equations

with da

(30)

written in terms of two arbitrary functions a(x+) and b(x) of x+ = x1 + x2 and x =
x1  x2 respectively, where 0 = 2e2/(s  1)1/2. it has been considered before as 1+1
dimensional evolution equation with x coordinate considered as a time variable. however,
the known regular soliton solutions [21,22], decay in all directions except the soliton world
line, which leads to the divergent integral for , this is why they have no physical meaning
in our problem. instead of it we choose a and b functions in the form

a = (a + 1) coth2k+1

for parameter a > 0 this solution is nonsingular in the whole (x1, x2) plane. sign denite-
ness of  requires k, l to be integer, while regularity at the light-cone, x+ = 0 or x = 0
is valid for k  0, l  0. in contrast to the algebraic chern-simons solitons (8), solution
(31) is exponentially decreasing in the plane for the future and past null innities as
e|x| or e|x|, while for the time-like and space-like innities as e(+)|x| (here
without loose of generality we put  > 0,  > 0). it is worth to note that our solutions are
related with exponentially localized planar solitons (el2) for davey-stewartson-i (ds-i)
equation [23] (also known as dromions [24]). these solutions have a rich integrable dynam-
ics [25], and are reducible to the liouville equation for ||, and to the dalembert equation
+ arg  = 0 for arg , like in the ds-ii case [26]. this reduction provides an integrable
dynamics for our exponentially localized chern-simons solitons [27]. moreover, comparing
to (8), having for n > 1 the zero at the beginning of coordinates, the zeroes for solution
(31)   x2k
 are located along the light cone x+ = 0, x = 0 for k > 0 and l > 0 cor-
respondingly. for k = 0 and l = 0, we have exponentially localized soliton located at the
beginning of coordinates, without zeroes and the rotation invariance at this point (fig.1).
if only one of the k, l values is vanishing, then we have two soliton solution represented
on fig.2. and symmetrical under one of the light cone directions. when both numbers do
not vanish we get four-soliton solution, represented on fig.3, with zeroes along the whole
light cone. for k > 1, l > 1, number of solitons remains four, however the order of zeroes
on the light cone is changing. as is well known, zeroes of , which produce singularities
for ln , lead to singularities of the gauge potential [3]. in the case (8) these singularities,
corresponding to the aharonov-bohm type potential, can be removed by xing the phase
of the wave function at the singular point. so the phase becomes the angle variable on
the plane with nite range of values. for solution (31), the singularities of potential a are
located along the light cone and can be compensated by derivation of function s as

independent of k and l, and is not quantized. moreover, the phase of  includes the
hyperbolic rotation angle  which is valued on the whole real line. so no restriction of
single-valuednees arises, and continual parameters s and  must be restricted only by the
relation (27).

at the end of this section we represent another problem related to our self-dual system
(28). namely, the hyperbolic self-duality equations (28) are equivalent to so(2, 1)/o(1, 1)

having the general solution + = +(x),  = (x+). these functions correspond
to the general solution of the liouville equation (30) with identication  = a1(x+),

which for a > 0 are regular everywhere on the plane with s3 > 0. the last condition
means that the solutions for a > 0 are non-topological. to have topologically nontrivial
congurations we need to consider a < 0 case, which would produces singularity for . for
the regular solution s with k > 0 or(and) l > 0 the plateau along the light cone appears,
leading to the zeroes for  in (31).

4. conclusions

in conclusions we stress that two long-range interactions considered in the present
paper, the chern-simons gauge interaction introduced to physics by s. deser, r. jackiw
and s. templeton [1] and the quantum potential introduced by l. de broglie [6] and d.
bohm [7], are compatible in supporting static soliton solutions in 2+1 dimensions, with
arbitrary n , only when the coupling constants for both interactions are quantized.

a further remark concerns the special case s = 1, when the madelung hydrodynamical
formulation of quantum mechanics becomes the euler equation and the continuity one [15].
for a special form of the nonlinearity an additional higher symmetry of the equations,
related to the membrane theory, has been described recently [30]. it would be interesting to
extend this work to include a chern-simons gauge eld, in attempt to produce completely
integrable model with innite number of conservation laws.

finally, we note existence of another integrable reduction of the models (1) and (23),
when the elds are independent on one of the space directions. in this case for s < 1 the
model reduces to the bf gauged nls, equivalent to nls [28], and for s > 1, to bf gauged
reaction-diusion analog of nls, equivalent to the reaction-diusion system. the last one
appears in the jackiw-teitelboim gravity and admits dissipative analog of solitons, called
dissipatons and related to the black holes of the model [29]. the interaction of dissipatons
show the resonance character [16].
