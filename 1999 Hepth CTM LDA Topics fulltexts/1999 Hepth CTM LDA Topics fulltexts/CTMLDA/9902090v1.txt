abstract

canonical quantization of three dimensional gravity in the rst order formalism

suggests that one should allow singular solutions. this paper addresses the impor-

tance of singular solutions in the path integral approach to quantum gravity. using

a simple ansatz for the dreibein and the spin connection in the de-sitter and the

anti-de-sitter spaces we propose that the sum over the 3d manifolds in the path

integral should be extended to include 2d surfaces.

pure gravity in three dimensions is a well studied subject [1, 2]. when formulated

in terms of the dreibein and the spin connection , it is equivalent to chern-simons theory

at the classical level[3, 4] . at the heart of this rather curious correspondence between a

spacetime theory of gravity and a topological eld theory lies the fact that there are only

constant curvature spaces in three dimensions. there are no local degrees of freedom both

in 3d gravity and chern-simons theory.

at the classical level , the formulation of gravity in terms of the spin connection and

the dreibein is equivalent to the metric formulation as long as the dreibein is invertible.

the non-polynomial dependence of the action on the metric in the metric formalism makes

the quantization harder if not impossible.2 on the other hand canonical quantization was

carried out in the rst order formalism [4]. witten showed that one has to remove the

requirement that the dreibein be invertible for the quantization program to work.

in a previous paper [6] we pointed out that, in the context of path integral quanti-

zation, two dimensional classical solutions are relevant in the three dimensional euclidean

gravity with zero cosmological constant. this is possible only in the rst order formalism.

although pure gravity with zero cosmological constant was shown to be nite and exactly

soluble [4, 5] the importance of the singular (2d) congurations needs to be stressed. in

this paper we extend our analysis to de-sitter and the anti-de-sitter spaces.

in order to dene quantum theory of gravity in any dimensions, especially as a path

integral, we have to know the global properties of the spacetimes which can not be deter-

mined from the equations of motion. the computation of the contributions of dierent

topologies to the path integral is an extremely non-trivial problem [7] since for example in

four dimensions we do not know which manifolds are homeomorphic. in the three dimen-

sions we certainly have a better understanding in the classication of the manifolds. for a

review see[8, 9, 10]. the triviality of the local data in 3d gravity and a better handle on

the classication of the manifolds give us a hope to study if the path integral quantization

( and maybe hartle-hawking no initial boundary proposal) might be realized or not. in

2 this issue resembles to the issue of quantization of nambu-goto action verses polyakov action in the

bosonic string theory.

this paper our goal is modest and rather pedagogical. we suggest that in the euclidean

path integral one has to include 2d congurations which are zero action solutions to the 3d

gravity. our eort is to show the relevance of singular solutions in the path integral quan-

tization. as stated earlier, in the canonical quantization singular solutions are important

[4].

the standard denition of path integral in quantum gravity is a sum over the rieman-

nian metrics g on a manifold m. one also has to sum over topologically distinct manifolds.

considering a three dimensional euclidean cosmological theory we have

z[] = xm z dg exps[, g]

(1)

if the einstein-hilbert action is used in the above formula, then the action of a certain

manifold is proportional to its volume. it is a non-trivial task to carry out the sum even

in the saddle point approximation. we dont know yet if the quantum theory of gravity

dened as a path integral as in the above form makes sense or not. we would like to stress

that the sum is understood as a sum over 3d manifolds only.

on the other hand one might be willing to dene the quantum theory as an integral

over the spin connection and the dreibein.

z[] = xm z dedw exps[, e, w]

(2)

the lesson we learn form the canonical quantization is that in the above formula we need

to allow singular dreibeins which give 2d manifolds. this suggests that we should sum

over the surfaces as well as the 3d manifolds. there is certainly a bit of tension between

the metric and the rst order formulations. i do not know how to resolve this yet. our

analysis in this letter is in the line of the second later formula.

we will consider the following action dened on a 3d manifold m with a euclidean

signature.

s0 =

this action is equivalent to the einstein-hilbert theory with a cosmological constant . 3

the indices (a, b, c) denote the tangent space and (i, j, k) denote the manifold coordinates.

the metrics , ab and gij have euclidean signature.  < 0 corresponds to the de-sitter

and  > 0 to the anti-de-sitter space. the dual riemann tensor can be dened to be

ra

kj = ka

j  ja

k + a

j. the relation between the ricci tensor and the dual

riemann tensor is rij = ea

i ek

b abcrc

jk. ek

b (x) lives in the cotangent bundle as usual. the

equations of motion demand that rij = 2gij and so the scalar curvature is r = 6.

we are interested in the singular solutions as well as regular ones.

we adopt the following simple so(3) symmetric ansatz which can be rather loosely

called monopole-instanton.4

j(~x) =

j(~x) =

jk xk (1  1) + a

j 2 + (ra  2) xa xji

j2 + (rb  2)xa xji

(4)

(5)

the functions a, b, i and i depend on r only. what we mean by r should be clear

from r2 = ijxixj. the symmetric ansatz is non-trivial since the spacetime is constructed

by a collaboration of the dreibein and the spin connection which are coupled through the

equations of motion.

the metric in the manifold can be recovered by the relation gij = abea

yields;

gij =

where {a, b} = (1, 2) and ab is antisymmetric. summations are implied over the repeated

indices. the upper limit r is arbitrary for now. varying the action with respect to six

elds give the equations of motion.

the two functions , f (r) and (r) , can not be determined from the equations. both of

them represent the gauge degrees of freedom in the theory. the metric becomes

before we move any further let us mention that choosing the conformal coordinate f (r) =

4r/g(4  r2) one obtains the standard ds3 and ads3 vacuum solution.

volume of the ds3 and ads3 are innite. we refer the reader to the discussion of gibbons-

hawking [13] on how to remove the divergence in this context. recently in the line of

ads/cft correspondence witten [14] gave a description to interpret these divergences as

the counter terms of the conformal eld theory living in the boundary (s 2 in this case).

our goal is dierent. we are interested in the nite action solutions. the singular gauge

f (r) = c , where c is a constant, has zero action. this corresponds to a two dimensional

sphere with a constant radius depending on the choice of c. these solutions should be

included in the sum for the path integral eqn (2).

we have proposed that two dimensional solutions, having zero action, are relevant for

three dimensional quantum gravity dened as a path integral over the dreibein and the

spin connection. our ansatz was rather simple. this work can be generalized to arbitrary

two dimensional surfaces. a word is in order regarding the loop computations. in the case

of vanishing cosmological constant witten [4, 5] had calculated the generating functional

exactly for a given manifold m. the result reduces to the calculation of the ray-singer

torsion of the manifold. it is not clear to the author now how to compute this torsion for

singular solutions. for the case of non-zero cosmological constant an exact solution has

not been given yet.
