abstract

the central charge in the n = 2 super-yang-mills theory plays an essential role in the work of seiberg
and witten as it gives the mass spectrum of the bps states of the quantum theory. our aim in this
note is to present a direct computation of this central charge for the leading order (in a momentum
expansion) of the eective action. we will consider the n = 2 super-yang-mills theory with gauge
group su (2). the leading order of the eective action is given by the same holomorphic function f
appearing in the low energy u (1) eective action.

pacs numbers: 11.30.pb , 11.30.qc , 11.10.ef .

introduction

tremendous progress has been made these last years in the understanding of the strong coupling regime
of the n = 2 super-yang-mills (sym) theory, pioneered by the work of seiberg and witten [1] for the
case of a su (2) gauge group. they succeeded in determining a non-perturbative solution for the leading
order of the low energy eective action, which is given, as explained in [2], by one single holomorphic
function f (), where  is the chiral n = 2 multiplet that contains the gauge eld for the unbroken u (1)
gauge group. later, it has been shown that this solution is in fact unique [3].

one essential tool used to obtain these results is the central charge z appearing in the n = 2 super-
poincare algebra, because it gives a lower bound for the mass m of the states of the theory, known as
the bps bound [4]:

m  |z| .

(1)

states that saturate this bound are called bps-states. in fact, it turns out that all the states of the
classical theory saturate this bound and that this remains true at the quantum level [5].

for the classical n = 2 sym action with gauge group su (2), a direct computation of z leads to [5]:

z = a (ne +  nm)

,

(2)

where a is the higgs eld expectation value,  = 4i
2 is the complex coupling constant, including
the gauge coupling constant g and the -angle, and ne and nm are the electric and magnetic numbers of
the state, respectively.

g2 + 

for the leading order of the low energy eective action, seiberg and witten [1] argued that the central

charge must be given by

z = a ne + ad nm ,

(3)

f
a

where ad =
(a). a rst check of this formula has been obtained in [6], where only the bosonic
contributions to z have been considered. recently, a direct and complete computation of z has been
performed in [7] and agrees with (3).

however it remains to show that the expression (3) is true for the high energy su (2) eective action.
indeed, even if the central charge is expected to be a boundary term and thus to receive contributions
only from the massless u (1) elds, this has not been proved so far. a rst step in that direction has been
achieved in [8], where (3) has been obtained by applying the bps trick to the bosonic part of the leading
order of the su (2) eective action.

in this note, we will also consider the leading order of the su (2) eective action, for which we will
perform a direct computation of z by evaluating the dirac bracket of two supersymmetry charges. the
result shows that (3) is the correct expression.

the plan of this note is as follows. in the rst section, we introduce the notations and expand the
eective action dened by f in components. in section 2, the supersymmetry current is constructed by
performing a local supersymmetry transformation. in section 3 we implement the dirac bracket, which
is the natural canonical structure in the presence of fermions. finally the central charge is obtained in
section 4 by computing the dirac bracket of two supersymmetry charges.

this note being only a sketchy presentation of the tools used to dene the supercurrent and the

canonical structure and of the computation itself, a more detailed publication is in preparation [9].

1 field content and eective action

the pure n = 2 sym action with gauge group su (2) contains a triplet of n = 2 chiral multiplets a in
the adjoint representation of su (2), labeled by the index a. the leading order of the eective lagrangian
is given in terms of f (a), with the same holomorphic function f as in the low energy eective action [1],
by:

le =

1

4 z d4 im (f ()) .

(4)

the classical lagrangian can be recovered by letting f () =

the auxiliary elds. the remaining elds are the gauge eld aa

we then expand this lagrangian into components choosing the wess-zumino gauge and eliminating
, the su (2)r-doublet 2 of weyl spinors
2 we denote by su (2)r the su (2) that rotates the two supersymmetry charges into each other. our conventions about
the su (2)r indices are the following: n = nmm with mn = nm , 21 = 1 ; m = mnn with mn = nm , 12 =
1 ; finally, (n) = n, and, as a consequence, ( n) = n.

an (n is the su (2)r index whereas  is the spinor index) and the complex scalar eld a, all in the
adjoint representation of su (2). aa

 and a are su (2)r-singlets.

where abc are the structure constants of su (2) and f a1 an () denotes the n-th derivative of f with
respect to a1    an . for further use, let us introduce the notation ia1 an and ra1 an for the imaginary
and real part of f a1 an , respectively. finally, we use the condensed notation

from now on, it is implicitly understood that f and its derivatives (as well as i, r, (i 1) and so on)

are to be evaluated at , except when otherwise stated.

2 supersymmetry transformations and currents

the lagrangian (5) is invariant under the global on-shell n = 2 supersymmetry transformations [10]
(with  = nn  n n ):

to compute the supersymmetry current, we perform a local supersymmetry transformation, dened by
local = n (x)n  (and similarly for n). since the action is invariant under a global supersymmetry
transformation (which means that the lagrangian transforms as a total derivative), we have, under a
local transformation:

localle = i n  j 

n  + v  ,

(8)

which denes the supersymmetry current j 

n .

remark: in fact, this relation denes the supersymmetry current j 

only up to an improvement term x []

(12)

m = 0 and f a

where the m denote the conjugate momenta to m. in fact, the second line of (10) denes two sets
of constraints f a
m ).
we thus apply the usual dirac approach for constrained systems [11]: rst, these constraints are easily
recognized to be of the second class type; then, we construct the dirac bracket, which ensures that the
constraints commute with any functions of m and m.

m(cid:1) (and similarly for f a

f ab(cid:0)0b

m  = 0, where f a

m = a

more precisely, the procedure to construct the dirac bracket is the following: let us denote by fi = 0
the constraints and by mij the matrix {fi, fj}c , which is invertible for second class constraints. the
dirac bracket of two functions a and b is then dened by

{a, b} = {a, b}c  {a, fi}c (m1)ij {fj, b}c ,

and it can be indeed checked that it satises {a, fi} = 0 for all a and i.

applying this construction to the case under study means that we can indierently use the spinor

in a poisson or a dirac bracket are evaluated at the same time.

note that the rst two lines are the same as for the canonical bracket, but we see in the next three lines
how the dirac construction modies the relation between the elds and the conjugate momenta for the
elds implied in the constraints.

4 supersymmetry and central charge

to dene a supersymmetry charge, we have to choose one current in the class dened by (9). as already
stated, the prescription is that we want that this charge reproduces the transformation laws (7) we started
with. clearly, we dene

with j 0

m  given by (9) and impose that

qm  =z d3x j 0

m  ,

{ qm , } = im  ,

(14)

(15)

paying attention to the boundary terms contributions. this leads to the particular solution corresponding
to x []

n = 0 in (9), and thus to the following supersymmetry charge:

qm = i z d3x  j a

we can now obtain the central charge, dened by z = i

(17)

now, taking into account the fact that the spinors decrease faster than r3/2 as r   and that the last
term is the gauss law, we obtain:

z =z d3x i  am ai +

f abai ! .

(18)

let us then denote by a the expectation value of the higgs eld and by a the direction (in the gauge
space) where it points to 4. thus, at spatial innity, a(x) = a a(x). the direction dened by a gives

4 a is a real su (2) triplet of unit norm, i.e. a a = 1.

5

in fact the direction of the unbroken u (1) gauge symmetry that survives the higgs phenomenon [5]. the
u (1) electric and magnetic elds are thus dened by e i = aeai and bi = abai respectively, and we
dene in the same way mi = am ai. taking nally into account the fact that the integrals of mi and
of bi on the sphere at spatial innity dene (up to numerical factor) the electric and magnetic numbers
ne and nm of the state [12], we obtain the central charge in the form proposed by seiberg and witten [1]

z = a ne + ad nm ,
