abstract

we discuss local mirror symmetry for higher-genus curves. specically, we consider

the topological string partition function of higher-genus curves contained in a fano surface
within a calabi-yau. our main example is the local p2 case. the kodaira-spencer

theory of gravity, tailored to this local geometry, can be solved to compute this partition

function. then, using the results of gopakumar and vafa [1] and the local mirror map [2],

the partition function can be rewritten in terms of expansion coecients, which are found

to be integers. we verify, through localization calculations in the a-model, many of these

gromov-witten predictions. the integrality is a mystery, mathematically speaking. the

asymptotic growth (with degree) of the invariants is analyzed. some suggestions are made

towards an enumerative interpretation, following the bps-state description of gopakumar

and vafa.

1. introduction and summary

in [2], the techniques of mirror symmetry were applied to the local geometry of a

fano surface inside a calabi-yau manifold. namely, from the data of the canonical bun-

dle of the surface, dierential equations were proposed whose solutions yield genus-zero,
gromov-witten-type invariants.1 from these, one arrives at integers after accounting for

contributions from multiple coverings. the mirror symmetry predictions were corrobo-

rated by independent a-model calculations using localization. the mirror principle was

the main tool used for verication; some more explicit xed point calculations were made,

as well. excess intersection considerations showed that the integers represent the eective

number of rational curves coming from the fano surface.

in this paper, we extend these techniques to higher-genus curves. for the a-model

calculations, we use localization techniques for higher-genus moduli space to compute the

gromov-witten invariants. the mirror principle does not apply at higher genus. the

analogue of the prepotential at higher genus is the topological partition function at genus

g, whose coecients are the gromov-witten invariants.

for the b-model equations governing the dependence of these partition functions, f (g),

on the complex structure moduli of the calabi-yau were found in [3][4]. in the eective 4-d

n=2 supergravity theory, emerging from type iib string theory compactication on the
calabi-yau, the f (g1) appear as coecients of the r2f 2g2 terms (here r and f are the
self-dual parts of the riemann tensor and the graviphoton eld strength, respectively)2.

the recursive nature of the equations comes from the fact that riemann surfaces with

marked points degenerate at the boundaries of moduli space  either into pairs of lower-

genus surfaces or surfaces with fewer marked points. as the anti-holomorphic dependence

of the topological partition functions is determined by an exact form, it only receives

contributions from the boundaries.

one can tailor the methods of [4] to the local situation we seek. our motivation

for doing so depends on two simplications in the local case. first, the solution of the

holomorphic anomaly equation using kodaira-spencer gravity simplies considerably in

1 these invariants are like the relative invariants of ionel and parker, except that the degen-

erations are sort of one-sided.

2 the genus zero prepotential f (0) determines the gauge kinetic terms and the masses of the
charged bps states. the information contained in the local geometry suces to obtain the rigid

theory (seiberg-witten theory), see [5] for reviews.

1

the local case due to the fact that the propagators involving the descendents of the puncture

operator (2-d dilaton) can be gauged to zero. second, the higher-genus gromov-witten

invariants are computable using localization. this is in constrast to complete-intersection

calabi-yau manifolds in toric varities, where the moduli space of higher-genus maps into

the calabi-yau is not simply expressible as the zero locus of a section of a bundle over
the moduli space of maps into an ambient toric manifold.3 for fano surfaces which are

themselves toric, we need not cut with a section to obtain the moduli space of interest.

this implies in particular that calculations can be made to x the ambiguity in solving the

kodaira-spencer recursions in the local case. in the global case of the quintic, by contrast,

classical geometry cannot x certain unknown constants.

after solving the kodaira-spencer theory and using the mirror map, we verify mirror

symmetry and apply the work of gopakumar and vafa [1] to organize the topological

partition functions in terms of coecients which should be integers, as they count bps

states of specied spin and charge (in the four-dimensional theory, spin refers to a lefschetz-

type su (2) action on the bps states). this integrality check is a strong test of the power

of m-theory and the approach of gopakumar and vafa. the asymptotic growth of the

invariants is also analyzed directly.

the mathematical interpretation of these integers is still unclear. a proper explana-

tion seems to involve moduli spaces of objects in derived categories. heuristic evidence

exists in support of this observation.

another explanation is lacking. the form of the partition functions predicted by
gopakumar and vafa is a generalization of the multiple cover formula (1/k3). the multiple

cover formula is well-understood mathematically, but the higher-genus generalizations are

a mystery.

2. localization at higher genus

the tools for the localization calculations have been available since the work of kont-

sevich [6], li-tian [7], behrend-fantechi [8], graber-pandharipande [9], and faber [10].

the moduli space, mg,0(; p), of stable maps from genus g curves into some toric
variety p with image in   h2(p; z) can have components of various dimensions. to do
intersection theory on it, we need a fundamental cycle of some appropriate dimension 

the virtual fundamental class.

3 we thank r. pandharipande for explaining this to us.

2

this procedure was developed in [8], and the equivariant localization for spaces with

perfect deformation theories was developed in [9]. in that paper, the authors treat the

case of interest to us: the restrictions to the xed point loci (under the torus action) of the

equivariant fundamental cycle on the space of holomorphic maps of genus g. the authors

give explicit formulas for the weights.

in our examples, we are interested in calculating chern classes of u, the bundle over
moduli space whose ber at a point (c, f )  mg,0(; p) is equal to h 1(c, fkp). it is

not dicult to compute the equivariant chern classes at the xed loci.

using these ingredients, we can perform localization calculations at higher genus. the

atiyah-bott xed point formula  true for virtual classes by [9]  reduces the calculation to

integrals over these xed loci. the dierent components of the xed loci are represented

by dierent graphs. we sum over the graphs using a computer algorithm. as all the

higher-genus behavior must be centered at the xed points (there are no xed higher-

genus curves), the xed loci are all products of moduli spaces of curves, and the graphs

are decorated by genus data at each vertex as well as degree data at each edge, as in [6].

the integrals over the moduli spaces are performed using the algorithm of faber [10].

in the following subsections, we summarize this procedure.

2.1. localization formulas

as discussed in [2], a fano surface within a complete-intersection calabi-yau con-

tributes to the gromov-witten invariants, producing an eective number of rational

curves.

in fact, the curves are not isolated and there is a whole moduli space of maps

into the fano surface, arising as a non-discrete zero locus of a section of a bundle over the

moduli space of maps in the calabi-yau. just as spaces of multiple coverings of isolated
curves contribute to the gromov-witten invariants by the excess intersection formula,4

the contribution from the surface b can be calculated as well. it is

k g

 =zmg,0(;b)

c(u),

(2.1)

4 the contribution, from a component of the zero locus y of some section, to the chern class
c(ny /m ) , where ny /m represents the normal bundle

c(e)

c(e) of some vector bundle e over m is ry

of y in m. the equation here follows from the reasoning between eqs. (5.4) and (5.5) in [2].

3

where   h2(b; z) and u is the bundle whose ber over (c, f )  mg,0(; b) is the
vector space h 1(c, fkb).5

we assume that b has a toric description so that we may use the torus action to dene
an action on m0,0(; b) (moving the image curves) and on u, which inherits the natural
action on the canonical bundle. we evaluate the gromov-witten invariants by localizing

to the xed points using the atiyah-bott formula

zm

 =xp zp (cid:18) ip 
e(p )(cid:19) ,

where the sum is over xed point sets p, ip is the embedding into m, and e(np/m ) is the
euler class of the normal bundle of p in m.

graber and pandharipande proved that this formula holds mutatis mutandis, with the

replacement of the integral of a class by evaluation over virtual fundamental cycles (in the

equivariant chow ring) of equivariant classes of deformation complexes. the equivariant

chern classes and bundles involved are then computed in the standard way, e.g. by looking

at the weights of sections and taking alternating products over terms in a complex. in our
case, following kontsevich, the xed moduli can be labeled by graphs. the xed locus m 
corresponding a graph  is a product of moduli spaces:

here v are the vertices of the graph and g(v) and val(v) are the genus and valence of the

m  =yv

mg(v),val(v).

vertex. (at a vertex, which is mapped to a torus xed point, the choice of a val(v)-marked

genus g(v) curve represents the only moduli.)

graber and pandharipande [9] found the weights of the inverse of the euler class of

the normal bundle to be:

where the case with g(v) = 0 is from [11]. here i(v) is the xed-point image of the vertex
v; edges e represent invariant p1s connecting the xed point labeled i(e) to j(e); and

ags f are pairs (v, e) of vertices and edges attached to them. f = (i(f )  j(f ))/de,
where i(f ) = i(e) and j(f ) = j(e) for the associated edge e  f. ef is the chern
class of the line bundle over m whose ber is the point e(f )  cv, a gravitational
descendant in physical terms  also known as a  class. we have dened the polynomial
r=0 rcgr(e), where e is the hodge bundle with bers h 0(kc) on moduli

pg(, e) =pg

space.

the bundle u, whose top chern class  we are calculating, has bers h 1(c, fkb)
over a point (c, f ). let us now x b = p2 and put  = d since h2(p2) is one-dimensional.
since the invariant maps are known and the maps from the genus g(v) > 0 pieces are

constants, we explicitly calculate the weights of the numerator in the atiyah-bott formula

to be:

i() =yv

i(e) +

(2.3)

where i = 1 + 2 + 3  3i.

2.2. fabers algorithm

we therefore have explicit formulas for the class to integrate along m . the integrals
involve the  classes and the mumford classes (from the hodge bundle). the integrals can

be performed by the recursive algorithm developed by faber.

a rough sketch of the idea of fabers algorithm is as follows [10]. wittens origi-

nal recursion relations from topological gravity [12], proved by kontsevich [13], suce to

determine integrals of powers of the is, which are the rst chern classes of the line
bundles whose ber is the cotangent space of the corresponding marked point, i = 1, ..., n

(the gravitational descendents). however, the integrals over m  involve the  classes as
well  the chern classes of the hodge bundle. these classes can be represented by cycles

involving the boundary components of moduli space as well as the is.

so a proper intersection theory including boundary classes is needed. the boundary
components are images under maps from mg1,n+2 (the map identifying the last two
points; this map is of degree two since swapping the points gives the same boundary
curve) and mh,s+1  mgh,(ns)+1 (the map identifying the two last points, which is
degree one except when both n = 0 and h = g/2). understanding the pull-back of the

5

boundary classes under these maps completes the reduction of intersection calculations

to lower genera. for example, the is pull back to is of corresponding points in the
new moduli spaces. one must also note that since the boundary divisors can intersect

(transversely, in fact), boundary classes must also be pulled back to moduli spaces to

which they do not correspond. we refer the reader to [10] for details.

what remains, then, is to express the chern classes of the hodge bundle e in terms of

the boundary divisors. this is precisely the content of mumfords grothendieck-riemann-

roch (g-r-r) calculation. briey (too briey!), there is the forgetful map  : mg,1 
mg,0 (we now set c  mg,1), with respect to which we wish to push forward the relative
canonical sheaf 
= e, the g-r-r formula tells us the chern character
. since 
classes of e (we need that r1
c,m
with the todd class of the relative tangent sheaf. the former involves the descendents,

= o). the formula calls for integration of ch(

c,m
c,m

c,m

)

while the relative tangent sheaf is dual to the relative cotangent sheaf, which diers from



c,m

only at the singular locus (on smooth parts, sections of the canonical bundle are just

one-forms). the todd expansion is responsible for the appearance of bernoulli numbers,

while the dierence from the canonical sheaf introduces the divisor classes.

therefore, integrals of descendent classes and  classes can be performed by using

mumfords formula (see section 1 of [14]) to convert  classes to descendents and divisor

classes, then on the boundaries of m pulling these clases back to the moduli spaces which

cover the boundaries. as these spaces have lower genera, the integrals can be performed

recursively. faber has written a computer algorithm in maple for this procedure, which

he generously lent us for this calculation.

2.3. summing over graphs

the contribution to the free energy f (g) from genus g curves in the class  is given

from the xed point formula as

k g

 =x

1

|a|zm 

i()
e(n vir)

,

(2.4)

with e(n vir)1 and i() as described in (2.2)(2.3). the formal expansion of the integrand
yields cohomology elements of mg,n, the moduli space of pointed curves at the vertices.
the integral over m  splits into integrals over these moduli spaces, against which the co-
homology elements of the right degree have to be integrated. in addition, the contribution

of a given graph must be divided by the order of the automorphism group a, as we are

6

performing intersection theory in the orbifold sense. a contains the automorphism group
of  as a marked graph and a zde factor for each edge which maps with degree de.

hence it remains to construct the graphs  which label the xed point loci of
mg,k(d, p2) under the induced torus action, then to carry out the summation and in-
tegration. a graph is labeled by a set of vertices and edges, and can be viewed as a
degenerate domain curve with additional data specifying the map to p2. the vertices v
represent the irreducible components cv. they are mapped to xed points in p2 under
the torus action. the index of this xed point i(v) and the arithmetic genus g(v) of the

component cv are additional data of the graph. the edges e represent projective lines

which are mapped invariantly, with degree de, to projective lines in the toric space con-

necting the pair of xed points. a graph without the additional data g(v), de, i(v) will be

referred to as undecorated.

the following combinatorial conditions specify a g,d,k graph representing a xed-

point locus of genus g, degree d maps with k marked points:6

(1) if e  edge() connects the vertices (u, v) then i(u) 6= i(v)

(2) 1  #(vertices) + #(edges) +pvvert() g(v) = g
(3) peedge() de = d
(4) {1, . . . , k} = vvert()s(v).

to construct all g,d,0 graphs we start by generating a list of all possible undecorated

graphs that can be decorated to yield g,d,0 graphs. hence the number of edges is restricted

by (3) while the number of vertices is restricted by (2). the undecorated graphs with nv

vertices can be represented by an nv nv symmetric incidence matrix, m. entries mi,j = 1

or 0 represent a link or no link between vi and vj, so with a xed number of edges ne there

will be (cid:16) (nv +1)nv

2
ne

which have dierent topology. to obtain invariant data, independent of the ordering of the

(cid:17) possibilities. a main problem is to identify among the graphs those

vertices and depending only on the topology of the graph, we use a so called depth-rst-

search algorithm. this starts with a vertex vk and descends level-by-level along all occuring

branches collecting the data of the encountered vertices, namely the valence (and in later

applications the additional information g(v) and i(v) as well as edge data d for the map),

into a list tk graded by the level, until all vertices have been encountered. a lexicographic
ordering can be imposed on the combined lists of all vertices t = {t1, . . . , tnv } and

6 condition four is relevant only for maps with k marked points, which we do not consider

(k = 0). s(v) is then the subset of marked points on the component cv.

7

ti = tk only if i is isomorphic to k. these invariants will be used for a.) generating
distinct undecorated graphs, b.) decorating them without redundancy, and c.) nding the
automorphism group.7 fig. 1 shows as an example the generation of genus 2, degree 3

graphs.

we have implemented the above generation of graphs8 of (2.4) in a completely au-

tomated computer algorithm that uses fabers algorithm to perform the integrals over

mg,n. we exhibit the results of these localization calculations in the instanton pieces

2.4. organizing the partition functions

in order to make enumerative predictions from the partition functions, we need the
analogue of the multiple-cover formula (1/k3). in other words, we need to know how a

fundamental object, a holomorphic curve or d-brane (bps state) of given charge and

spin content, contributes to the partition function.
the functional form of f (g) was derived in [1]:

f () =

(2.6)

7 a useful computer program [15] was used to check the number of undecorated graphs.
8 the number of graphs grows very quickly with the genus. e.g., to calculate the d = 5 term
(for g = 0, . . . , 4) in (2.5), one sums over six times 173{21}, 733{101}, 2295{313}, 5353{719},
11101{1442} fully-decorated graphs, where the number in braces indicates the number of graphs
with just g(v) and de decorations. the maximal dimension of a vertex moduli space dim(mg,n) =
14 occurs in the calculation of (g, d) = (4, 5) in the star graphs  irreducible genus 4 curves with

ve legs. at this dimension, 22462 dierent 2-d gravity integrands must be evaluated.

fig. 2: the (weighted) number of bps states ng

d for the local p2 case.

as an immediate check, we note that ng

d = (1)d(d+1)(d+2)/2 when g =(cid:18) d  1

2 (cid:19) . in

the bps language, these integers count highest-spin two-brane states with a given charge.10
the moduli space of polynomials of degree d is p(d+1)(d+2)/21, and (d + 1)(d + 2)/2 equals
the euler characteristic of this space. a simplication for highest-spin states allows us to

ignore the moduli corresponding to bundles on d-branes [1]. further enumerative remarks

are made in section four.

the form (2.6) amounts to a set of multiple-cover formulas which can be found by

extracting the appropriate coecient of  and k. let us denote by cg(h, d) the contribution
of a genus g object in a class  to the partition function at genus g + h in class d. from
(2.6) we see that cg(h, d) is the coecient of 2(g+h)2 in d1(2 sin(d/2))2g2. some
of these numbers have been corroborated by mathematical calculations. for example,

9 bps states are killed by the right-handed supersymmetry generators (half), where so(4) =
su(2)l  su(2)r. bps supermultiplets, formed from a spin (j1, j2) fock vacuum, have states
with left-handed content [( 1
2 )  2(0)]  j1, while the 2j2 + 1 right-handed states only contribute
an overall factor (with sign). dening i = ( 1

2 )  2(0), g labels the representation ig.

10 this case was rst discussed in [16].

10

c0(0, d) = 1/d3 [17][18]. c0(h, d) was calculated in [14], and cg(h, 1), g  1 in [19]. r.
pandharipande has communicated to us another subtraction scheme when h = 0 which

also yields integers.

a puzzle remains, however. the multiple-cover formulas predict, for example, that

genus two objects of degree four contribute to the partition function at genus two, degree

eight. however, no double covers of genus two curves by genus two curves are expected.

in general, since no covering maps from genus g to g + h curves exist, how does one even

dene the covering contribution? perhaps a formulation via spaces of sheaves (which we

discuss in section four) is in order.

2.5. example

for example, the coecient k 2

4 = 514/5 of q4 in f (2) in (2.5) can receive contribu-

4, n1

tions from the non-zero integer invariants n0

1, n0

2, n0

c1(1, d) = 0, and c2, (0, d) = d, we see

k 2

4 = 3(4/240)  6(2/240)  192(1/240) + 231(0)  102(1) = 514/5.

3. b-model calculations

though [4] developed recursion relations for calabi-yau threefolds, the lesson of [2] is

that considerations involving holomorphic curves inside fano subvarieties within calabi-

yau threefolds may be isolated to calculations on the canonical bundle qua normal bundle

of the surface. the reason for this is that all curves within the surface have negative self-

intersection and so cant be moved o of the surface. the topological partition functions

count holomorphic curves of higher genus, in some sense, so we expect to nd a local

version of the equations of kodaira-spencer gravity, developed in [3][4]. we will now

describe the simplications in the kodaira-spencer theory as we specialize to the local

case.

3.1. the vacuum line bundle and correlation functions

in n = 2 topological theories the vacuum state |0i transforms as a section of a

holomorphic line bundle l over the moduli space m of the theory.

in the case of the

b-type topological -models, the former will be identied with the holomorphic (3,0)-form

 while m will be identied with the complex structure moduli space of the calabi-yau

11

geometry x, which is mirror dual to the geometry x on which we count the holomorphic
maps. m has a special kahler structure, with kahler potential k(z, z).

by the sewing axioms of topological eld theory the vacuum amplitudes at genus g

f (g) are sections of l22g over m. the general topological correlations function f (g)
i1...in
l22g symnt m are dened as covariant derivatives of the potentials f (g) as f (g)
i1...in =
di1 . . . din f (g). the di are covariant with respect to metric connection i
lk = gi mlgk m
of the weil-peterson-zamolodchikov metric gkl(z, z) = k lk on m as well as the kahler
connection ai = ik of the line bundle l.



3.2. the key holomorphic object at genus zero: f (0)

i1,i2,i3

the genus zero three-point functions f (0)

i1,i2,i3 , physically well-known as the yukawa
couplings of the heterotic string with standard embedding or the magnetic moments in

the type-ii compactications, are of special importance because, as their moduli space has

no boundaries, they are truly holomorphic and appear as building blocks in the recursive

denition of the higher loop amplitudes.

they can be explicitly calculated as integrals over the calabi-yau manifold x

which can be expressed as the derivatives of suitable combinations of period integrals over
the the cycles of x. these period integrals can be most easily reconstructed from solutions
of the picard-fuchs system of x. for the local case, the f (0)
a limit of a global calabi-yau geometry or intrinsicially from the picard-fuchs system for
the local geometry. we sometimes write ci,j,k for f (0)

can be dened either as

i1,i2,i3

i,j,k.

3.3. the canonical coordinates ti and the holomorphic limit

other correlation functions f (g)

i1,...,ir

for g > 0 are not holomorphic.11 however, due

to a uniquely distinguished class of coordinate systems on m, the canonical coordinates,

there is a well-dened limit one can take to dene holomorphic correlators.

all holomorphic derivatives vanish at p0

ij|p0 = 0,

t1 . . . tr k|p0 = 0 .

(3.2)

let as above p0 be at z = 0, t = t0. then (3.2) implies that in the t coordinates the
leading term in i = (ti  t0) of k = c + o() and gij = ci,j + o() is constant. when
re-expressed in the coordinates zi, the holomorphic parts of k and g in the i  0 limit
are

k = c  log(0),

gi m =

ck m .

(3.3)

in all quantities to be discussed below we will take the holomorphic   0 limit.

the ti at pm have the additional property that they are identied by mirror symmetry
are curve-

with the complexied kahler parameters of the mirror x, and the f (g)
counting functions for holomorphic maps of genus g into x. note also that ti at pm are
the special coordinates in which the holomorphic parts of the kahler connection and the

i1,...,ir

weil-peterson connection vanish, i.e. di becomes the ordinary derivative ti.

at this point there is important simplication in the local case. as is clear from the

dierential equations associated to the local case [20][2], 0 = 1 is always a holomorphic
solution, and hence for the local case the holomorphic part of the kahler potential becomes

trivial in the limit (3.3).

3.4. the holomorphic anomaly at genus one and the derivation of f (1)

fig. 3: the degenerations of a genus 3 riemann surface, with the symmetry factors
by which they contribute to the calculation of f (3).
in the local case, these are all the
contributions. the diagrams correspond (in order) to terms in the expression for f (3),
though one expression may involve several graphs. for example, the fth line in the gure
,4 f (0)
contains the three graphs which contribute to  2
,3 . lines denote factors of
s2, genus g components with valence n represent factors of f (g)
,n . in the global case, there
are 81 additional graphs with  propagators.

therefore it is natural to split f i

ties: f i

kl = i

kl log f + i

l k log f  vl,akvi,a + f i

kl, where f i

kl now transforms covariantly,

f  l, and vi,a transform as tangent vectors. the choices of the f , vi,a, f i

kl are by no

means independent, however.

if we specialize to the one-modulus case, as in our main

example the local p2, we can in addition set f z

zz = 0 and in the holomorphic limit get the

where v  t m to render szz covariant. the simplication in the second line is due to the
fact that k is constant in the holomorphic limit for the local case and f can chosen to be
constant as well. further potentials needed to solve for the f (g) in the global cases are

s  l2, with cj kl = e2k didj
and k  = 2s can be interpreted as propagators in the topological gravity theory, where

we will see that a choice of the dierent holomorphic ambiguities can be made so that k i

and if we set the holomorphic ambiguity in the special solution to this equation to zero, it

the derivation of f (g) proceeds recursively. one rst considers the holomorphic anom-

notice that in the local case the  drops out, as expected. these terms represent the

various degenerations of the genus g riemann surface, and it is useful to keep track of the

calculation by interpreting them as feynman rules for the auxiliary nite quantum system.

clearly the symmetry factors are of the utmost importance to the calculation. we exhibit
these and all 41 diagrams which contribute in the local limit to f (3) in fig. 3.

3.6. the local p2 case

p2 is torically dened by the integral lattice polyhedron  = conv{(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1)}.

the non-compact a-model geometry13 o(3)  p2 is torically described by a fan spanned

by {(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1)}. by the mirror construction of [22] applied to the local

case [20], the mirror b-model geometry follows then from the periods of a meromorphic

dierential  on the riemann surface described by the vanishing of the (1, 1)-shifted new-
ton polynomial associated to the dual polyhedron  = conv{(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)}.
in this case, we simply have a cubic p = x3

3  3x1x2x3 = 0 in p2 = p.

1 + x3

2 + x3

dierential equations for the periods of  in the mirror geometry follow from the c
scaling actions on the local a-model geometry. as described in [20] these translate directly
into picard-fuchs dierential operators, which in the p2 case gives14

13 a simple global calabi-yau, in which this geometry is embedded, is e.g. dened by the
vanishing locus of a degree 18 polynomial in p4(1, 1, 1, 6, 9). using mirror symmetry some gromov-
witten invariants for this space have been calculated [21].
14 here we have set x = 27z = 1/3 = 27(1/a3
singularities to 0, 1, .
15 this function is the logarithmic integral (a1)(a2)

x 2f1 of the hypergeometric function
2f1(a1, a2; a3, x) solving l. solutions i of l are related to the periods of p = 0, i =ri

y2 = 4x3  xg2  g3 with g2 = 3(8 + 3), g3 = 8 + 203  6. the general theory of picard-fuchs

to nd the solutions to (3.11) which correspond to actual integrals of  over cycles, we

relate them to the periods over the vanishing cycles. both periods (apart from the trivial

residue) are xed up to an overall normalization by the lefschetz theorem on vanishing

it turns out that t(x) = i

2(a1)(a2) g(a1, a2, a3; x) is precisely the mirror map16 and
td follows by analytic continuation of the vanishing period at x = 1 to produce at z = 0

at this point, we can use the three-point functions to solve the p2 topological partition

functions at higher-genus as we have outlined in this section. we will use this analysis to
investigate the asymptotic growth of the n0
d in the next section. the numerical invariants
extracted from these higher-genus calculations were listed in fig. 2. these b-model

calculations yield results for very high degree, though adding genera requires xing the

holomorphic ambiguity.

16 the implicit choice of the constant term log(27) ts the denition of the mirror map, a fact
which turns out to be right for all local mirror symmetry systems whose picard-fuchs equation

is meijers equation.

17 if we simply take the limit of the 3-fold periods, the normalization of td diers from this
choice by 3.

18

solving the b-model recursion relations gives the topological partition functions. as

with knowing the prepotential in (genus zero) mirror symmetry, this is not enough to make

enumerative predictions. first one needs to nd the kahler parameters ti (the mirror
map). in the present case, the mirror map states that the kahler parameter t is equal

to the logarithmic solution of the picard-fuchs equation (3.11) of the local geometry (no

ratio is needed since the holomorphic solution is constant). then one must organize the

prepotential according to (2.6), as outlined in section 2.4, to account for multiple-cover
contributions. the result is an expansion in terms of integer coecients ng

.

of course, this process demands that the ambiguity (the holomorphic section f (g)) at
each step in the recursion be xed. there are 2g  1 unknowns in this function, which we

{di}

x by matching gromov-witten invariants for the rst 2g  1 degrees at genus g.

there is another way to x one of these coecients. ghoshal and vafa argue in [24]
that the leading coecient of the ambiguity f (g) at the conifold singularity is determined
by the free energy of the c = 1 string evaluated at the self-dual radius. recall that f (g) has
k uk, where the conifold is at u = 0.18 it turns out that the leading
behavior of f (g) is determined by a(g)
2g2 alone, as the other terms both in the anomaly
and from the recursion have subleading contributions. ghoshal and vafas identication

the form p2g2

k=0 a(g)

then gives

a(g)
2g2 =

b2g

2g(2g  2)

,

where the b2g are bernoulli numbers. we should comment that as f (g) is a section of the
vacuum line bundle l, this equation only makes sense in a certain gauge. one can use the
g = 0 contribution to x the gauge, then determine the higher a(g)
2g2. note that the inde-
pendent determination of the ambiguity via localization calculations gives a corroboration
of this formula at g = 2, 3. in fig. 2, the entries n4

d6 rely on this procedure.

this is how fig. 2 was derived from the b-model.

4. some enumerative issues

the holomorphic curves that these numbers count are not simply worldsheet instan-

tons. as shown by vafa and gopakumar [1], they represent d-branes in type-ii or m-

theory compactications. in this section, we will analyze the growth of these invariants

18 ghoshal and vafa employ a double-scaling limit   0 and u  0 with /u xed, where
 is the string coupling. this isolates the leading behavior of f (g) from the subleading terms in
f (g+h).

at genus zero, then make some remarks regarding a proper mathematical interpretation of

the integers.

4.1. asymptotic growth of states

let us return now to the solutions (3.13) of the p2 period equations.
the singularity at x = 1 limits the radius of convergence of the instanton expansion
and in particular the exponential growth of |nd| must be e2t2(1), where t2 = im(t). for
an interpretation of the nd  n0
d as bps counts for some physical system, the logarithm
of the multiplicity of the bps states is the entropy in the large d limit and an important

critical exponent of the theory. the value

the others have, as in the one-modulus compact three-folds [29], power series solutions at

this point signaling a conformal eld theory. in the compact case these can be identied

as gepner-type conformal eld theories: tensor products of minimal n = 2 models.

the analytic continuation to 1

z = 0 is particularly simple due to a barnes integral
representation  see [25][29][30] for similar applications. as in [30] it is easy to see that,
given the above denition of t at z = 0 one gets t = 1

at 1/z = 0 if z = ebx. in particular, the p2 example has a conformal point at 1/z = 0,

fig. 5: near linear dependence of the growth rate of instantons with the euler (coxeter)
number.

clearly it would be extremely interesting to nd the physical system whose entropy of

bps states approaches in some limit the critical exponents which we have provided here.

it is noteworthy that the coecients t2(1) for the del pezzo cases grow linearly (to a close
approximation) with the euler number assigned to the corresponding local calabi-yau,

i.e. twice the coxeter number of the associated group. if, as for k3, there is a bosonic

string-like oscillator algebra on the moduli spaces, this would be the expected behavior.
for example, in the local p1  p1 case, an oscillator-type partition function for some of

the local invariants was found by nekrasov and kol [31], though the sense in which the

coecients were euler characteristics of a moduli space remains unclear. this brings us

to our next question.

4.2. what is the moduli space?

from the work of gopakumar and vafa ii [1], we learn that the integers arising from a

proper organization of the topological string partition functions simply encode the number

22

and properties of bps states in the specied charge (homology class). note that the bps

charges are specied by a homology class, not a genus. in fact, dierent genera are part

of a connected moduli space of bps states of specied charge.

the integers describe the representation content of the bps states under an additional

conjectural lefschetz-type su (2) action on the cohomology of this moduli space. as is

familiar from bps counting on k3 [32][33], this moduli space is naively comprised of pairs

of holomorphic curves together with at u (1) connections. this thinking may be too naive.

what is the proper denition of the moduli space? experience is teaching us that d-

branes can be thought of as objects in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves.

indeed, this category is important for kontsevichs homological mirror conjecture [11].

also, hilbert schemes of points are a kind of intermediate step between moduli spaces

of vector bundles and full-out derived moduli spaces, and they appear prominently in d-

brane counts. evidence also comes from requiring the fourier-mukai transform to act as a

symmetry of objects for k3 compactications [34]. further, d-brane charges naturally live
in k-theory [35][36]. for p2 these moduli spaces of objects are not well known, though

some poincare polynomials of moduli spaces of points (sheaves supported on points or

schemes of nite length) have been computed, as have some moduli spaces of higher-rank

bundles. heisenberg algebras have been found to act on cohomology, as for k3, which

we take as loose evidence that these are the right spaces to study [37]. in addition, the

exponential growth of the local invariants (with exponent depending on the non-compact

euler number) is in line with (super-)oscillator partition functions.

let us now think of sheaves as one-term complexes, so as objects in a derived cat-

egory. then the moduli spaces of objects in this category should be the proper general

framework for these questions. moduli spaces of derived objects in general do not exist
due to obstructions. for this reason, derived moduli spaces 20 [38] may be the technology

necessary to study the higher-genus integer invariants in the general case. euler characters

for such spaces can be dened. one can hope that this formulation of the question will

lead to insight regarding the higher-genus problem for the quintic, which is not amenable

to localization calculations.

thinking of derived moduli spaces rather than moduli of sheaves is more in line with

the spirit of kontsevichs mirror symmetry conjecture [11]. his motivation for introducing

20 derived quot schemes, in fact, which retain all obstruction data in the form of a complex.

in short, dg-schemes do not have tangent spaces, they have tangent complexes.

23

an a structure came in part from trying to dene an extended moduli space of calabi-
yau manifold as the moduli space of the structure sheaf of the diagonal m in m  m

by deforming the associative algebra of functions as a homotopy associative dierential
graded (a) algebra.

in fact, it is likely that we must treat our sheaves as sheaves in the total space of the

canonical bundle of p2. this would introduce further complexity.

4.3. counting singular curves

for many applications, the dierences between d-brane as cycle with bundle, as sheaf,

or as derived object are unimportant. however, we may not be so lucky here. the argument
in the second paper of [1] gives a heuristic derivation of n0
3(p2) = 27. this should be equal
to (m3), the euler characteristic of the d-brane moduli space m3 of curves in the class
3h, where h is the hyperplane class generating h2(p2). the ng
d for g 6= 0 represent the
3(p2)
dierent characters of the additional ber-lefschetz su (2) action on cohomology. n0
is obtained by noting that the jacobian of a smooth degree three curve can be identied

with the curve itself (which has genus one). therefore the choice of curve plus point on

jacobian is the same as the choice of curve plus point on curve. if we choose the point
rst (a p2 worth of such choices) and ask how many degree three curves pass through the
point (a p8), we see m3 to be a p8 bration over p2, with euler characteristic 9  3 = 27.
following [33], one might attempt to count the euler characteristic by noting that
m3 must be a bration over the moduli space of degree three curves in p2, with ber
equal to the jacobian of a given curve. as jacobians of smooth curves have trivial euler

characteristic, we can localize our counting to the singular (more specically, the rational

curves). there is a moduli space of such curves (for k3 this space was zero dimensional),

each of which should contribute some xed amount determined by the singularity type.
however, among the degree three curves we necessarily have reducible (e.g., (x + y )(x 2 +
y 2 + z2) = 0  p2) and even unreduced (e.g., (x + y )3 = 0  p2) curves. here is where

the sheaf interpretation is necessary. over the unreduced curves, which can be thought

of as multiply-wrapped branes, we should have rank k bundles (if k is the number of

wrappings). these sheaves then have the same characteristic numbers as the non-singular

curves. we are still unsure of how to perform the counting (e.g., there is a discrete innity
of higher-rank bundles over p1 with xed degree). this interpretation is consistent with

the moduli spaces of objects in the elliptic curve.

24

we can now hope to state gopakumar and vafas approach as a conjecture that
the euler characteristics of the appropriate moduli dg-stack of derived objects on p2 of
characteristic numbers (r = 0, c1 = d, c2 = d2) have euler characteristic equal to n0
d. this
conjecture might have to be tailored to account for the fact that the objects properly live
on kp2 with support in p2. whether we need the full weight of dg-stacks (which have

tangent spaces which include all obstructions to deformations) to check this, remains to

be seen. for the general situation, it is likely that we would.

these spaces may give some insight into the multiple cover formulas of vafa and

gopakumar, as well. one also must nd an additional ber-lefschetz su (2) action on
the derived moduli spaces to agree with vafa and gopakumars interpretation for ng1
exciting work lies ahead.
