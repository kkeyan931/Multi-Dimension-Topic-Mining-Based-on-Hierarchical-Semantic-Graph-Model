abstract

the elds nonlinear modes quantization scheme is discussed. new form of the perturbation theory
achieved by unitary mapping the quantum dynamics in the space wg of (action, angle)-type collective
variables. it is shown why the transformed perturbation theory contributions may accumulated exactly
on the boundary wg. abilities of the developed formalism are illustrated by examples from quantum
mechanics and eld theory.

 introduction
one may use for my talk another titles. for instance:
 quantization of nonlinear modes (waves)
 strong-coupling perturbation theory
 examples of unitary transformation of path-integral variables
 quantum theory and symplectic geometry
 path-integral solution of h-atom problem
 particles creation in the integrable systems
 symmetry breaking in the o(4, 2)-invariant eld theories
 ghost-free quantization of yang-mills elds

but the role of topologies in the perturbation theory structure appears so new for me that i oer
concentrate the attention just on this question.
(details of the formalism one can nd in hep-
th/9811160.)

we will consider the expansion of integral:

in vicinity of real  time path

a(f ) = z dueis(u)f (u)

uc

:

s(uc)
uc  0.

this demands knowledge of green function g. but the equation:

(2
 + v(uc))xg(x, x; uc) = (x  x).

is translationally noninvariant if uc = uc(x) and therefore has not explicit solution. by this reason
this ordinary (wkb) method has not a future.

i would like to demonstrate the strict strong-coupling perturbation theory, uc = o(1/g). actually
i will follow the idea that the substitution may considerably simplify calculations, helping avoid above
problem.

 unitarity condition

1

let us calculate probability to nd somewhere a particle with energy e

1(e) = z dx1dx2a1(x1, x2; e)a

1(x1, x2; e).

using the spectral representation of one-particle amplitude:

a1(x1, x2; e) = xn


n(x2)n(x1)
e  en + i

,

  +0,

all unnecessary contributions with e 6= en were canceled in 1(e):

1

1(e) = xn |

e  en + i|2 =
together with real part of propagator 1/e  en + i.
inclusion of last equality in (1) into formalism, i.e. transition from a1a

i would like to exclude such unnecessary contributions (like e 6= en). this means
1 to absorption part ima1.
then the unitarity (optical theorem: 2i|a1|2 = a1  a
1) becomes sucient and necessary
i will show, it denes the complete set of contributions in the physically acceptable

(1)



 xn

(e  en),

condition:
domains.

the formalism based on the statements:

(a) if a  eis(u) and s(u) is the action, if   |a|2 is measurable, if the equality 2i|a|2 = a  a
is taken into account, then:

(f ) = ei k(ej)z dm(u, j)eiu (u,e) f (u, e)  o(u) f (u)

where expansion over dierential operator

k(ej) =

1

2 z dx



j(x)



e(x) 

1

2 z dxj(x)e(x)

generates the perturbation series, functional u(u, e) = o(e3) describes interactions, the measure dm
is diracian (-like):

at the very end one should take j = e = 0.

dm = yx

du(x)  s(u)

u(x)

+ j(x)! .

note: the variational principle is derivable from above rst quantum principles.
(b) if coordinate uc(, ) and corresponding momentum pc(, ) obey the equations

{uc, hj} =

hj
pc

, {pc, hj} = 

hj
uc

, at arbitrary j,

where hj(u, p) = 1

2p2 + v(u)  ju and {,} is the poisson bracket, if
hj(, ) = hj(uc, pc), h()  h0(, ),

2

(2)

(3)

then:

(a) the transformed measure has the form:

dm(, ) = yt

d(t)(t)(  

hj


)(  +

hj


),

(it is t  wg mapping) since, as follows from (2, 3)

(a) (uc, pc) are the solutions of incident (classical) hamiltonian equations:

{ui

c, uk

c} = {pi

c, pk

c} = 0, {ui

c, pk

c} = ik

(b) dimwg  dimt , where t is the incident phase space (reduction of t ).
(c) dimwg may be even or odd (splitting: wg = t g  r).
(c) if the green function g(t  t) of equations

 =

hj


,

 = 

hj


,

hj(, ) = hj(uc, pc), have the form:

g(t  t) = (t  t), g(0) = 1,

then the quantum corrections to semiclassical approximation are accumulated on the boundaries of
t g:

 = sc +zt g

dq,

where sc is the semiclassical contribution. the explicit form of quantum corrections term dq will
be given.

noting (b) and considering space coordinates as the indexes of special cell.

 the generalization of formalism on the eld theory, where uc = uc(~x; , ), becomes evident
by the same reason ((b) and (c)) the formalism allows to consider also the situation where

(, ) = (, )(x, t). last one incorporates the gauge freedom.

(d) the measure

dm(, ) = yt

d(t)d(t)(   ()  j

uc


)(  + j

uc


),

admits the cotangent foliation of quantum force j:

dm(, ) = yt

d(t)(t)(   ()  j)(   j)

and

k(je) =

1

2 z dt{j e + j e}

e  ec = e

 cotangent foliation of quantum force j gives the completely hamiltonian description
 the foliation allows quantize all classical degrees of freedom independently
 the auxiliary variable ec is invariant of canonical transformations
 the perturbation theory describes uctuations of classical ow through elementary cell u p
 the foliation solves the technical problem of functional determinants calculation.

the n-into-m particles transition amplitudes is

anm(q; q) =

(qk)z(),

where q

k (qk) are the in- (out)-going particles momenta. the hat symbol means:

(q)  z dxeiqx



(x)  z dxeiqx (x).

the vacuum-in-vacuum transition amplitude in the auxiliary background eld  is

where s0 is the free part of action:

z() = z dueis0(u)iv (u+),

(4)

s0(u) =

1

2 zc+

dx((u)2  m2u2)

and v describes the interactions:

v (u) = zc+

dxv(u).

the time integrals in (4) are dened on mills time contour:

 including the black-body environment ( , z) is the generating functional of the real-time nite
temperature eld theory of schwinger-keldysh type. if there is not correlations on the time innities,
then ( , z) may be continued on the matsubara imaginary-time contour.

 s-matrix interpretation allows to extend the formalism on the nonequilibrium media considering

 factorization property
in the expression

(, z) = en (,z; )0().

the external properties, xed by , z, and internal ones, described by 0(), are factorized: the
operator en (,z; ), where n = n+ + n and

n(, z; )  z d1(q)eiqz(q) (q) 

(q),

maps interacting elds system,

0() = z du+dueis0(u+)iu (u+++)eis0(u)+iv (u),

on the observable states.

this property reects adiabaticity of quantum perturbations.
 dirac measure
we will use the substitution :

u(x) = u(x)  (x),

with boundary conditions:

z

dx(x)u(x) = 0 : (x)|(x) = 0

to establish the equality: 2iaa = a  a. expanding over :
i2rc+

0() = ei k(j)z dm(u, j)eiu (u,)e

dx(x)(j(x)v(u))

where

dm(u) = yx

du(x)(2

u + m2u + v(u)  j),

k(j, ) =

1

2zc+

dxj(x) (x),

u(u, ) = v (u + )  v (u  )  2zc+

dx(x)v(u) = o(3).

note: last exponent is linear over u(x) because of -likeness of measure dm.

 generating functional
substitution of 0 gives (a):

where

(, z) = ei k z dm(u)e+is0(u)iu (u;)en (,z;u),

n(, z; u) = n(+, z+; u) + n(, z; u)

6

and

n(, z; u) = z d(q)e((q)+(q))|(q, u)|2,

where (q) = ln z(q)/ is the chemical potential and

(q, u) = zc+

dxeiqx(2 + m2)u(x)

dm(u) = yx

du(x)(2

u + m2u + v(u)  j),

k(j, ) =

1

2zc+

dxj(x) (x),

u(u, ) = v (u + )  v (u  )  2zc+

dx(x)v(u) = o(3).

note: if uc(x) ia a good function, then (q, u) = 0 since q2 = m2 by denition.

a.the functional -function is dened as follows:

comments

yx

(fx(u)) = z yx

de(x)



e

2irc+

dxe(x)fx(u)

so, considering the double integral aa we may introduce integration over two independent elds u
and e. then, (i) integral over e gives the -function and (ii) last one denes integral over u. one can
say: the real-time theories are simple.

it should be underlined that the measure dm was derived for real  time processes only.
b. only strict solutions of equation

2
u + v(u) = 0,

(5)

should be taken into account.

c.  is described by the sum of all solutions of eq.(5), independently from theirs nearness in the

functional space.

d.  did not contain the interference terms from various topologically nonequivalent contributions.

this displays the orthogonality of corresponding hilbert spaces.

e. the measure dm and k includes j(x) as the external source.

its uctuation disturb the

solutions of eq.(5).

f. if j is switched on adiabatically then the eld disturbed by j(x) belongs to the same manifold

(topology class) as the classical eld uc.

g. (selection rule) if vuc is the zero-modes volume occupied by given uc, then taking into ac-
c, then u
c

count b, c and f one should leave the contribution with largest vuc:
contributions may be neglected with o(vu

if dimvuc > dimvu

c/vuc) accuracy.

note: the imaginary-time (kink-like) contributions may be neglected i theirs contribution are

realized on zero (vu

c/vuc = 0) measure.

7

h. our denition of  restores the stationary phase methods perturbation theory in the vicinity
of trivial extremum uc = 0. the comparison of our and wkb perturbation theories is impossible for
the case uc 6= 0 since last one is unknown for this case.
g. the i-prescription should be used to avoid the singularities and for right denition of time
analytical continuation to connect (if this is not in contradiction with topological principles) the real-
and imaginary-time trajectories.

comments


 the zero modes dierential measure was dened without faddeev-popov ansatz.
 the faddeev-popov ghosts would not arise.

 the ghost-free quantization scheme may be shown for yang-mills eld theories.
