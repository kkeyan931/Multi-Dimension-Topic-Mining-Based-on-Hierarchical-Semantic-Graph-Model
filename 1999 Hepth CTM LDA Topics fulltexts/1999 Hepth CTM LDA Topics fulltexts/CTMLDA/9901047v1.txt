use of quadratic dierentials for description of
defects and textures in liquid crystals and 2+1

gravity

arkady l.kholodenko

abstract

the theory of measured foliations which is discussed in part i in con-
nection with the train tracks and meanders is shown to be related to
the theory of jenkins-strebel quadratic dierentials by hubbard and ma-
sur (acta math.142 ,221 (1979)).usefulness of the measured foliations
for description of defects and textures in liquid crystals had been rec-
ognized by poenaru and langevin some time ago.based on the theory
of quadratic dierentials , it is demonstrated that this formalism not
only provides the adequate description of defects and textures in liq-
uid crystals but also is idealy suited for study of 2+1 classical gravity
which was initiated in the seminal paper by deser jackiw and t hooft
(ann.phys.152,220 (1984)).not only their results are reproduced but,in
addition,many new results are obtained.in particular,using the results of
rivin (ann.math.139,553 (1994)) the restriction on the total mass of the
2+1 universe is removed .it is shown ,that the masses can have only dis-
crete values and,moreover, the theoretically obtained sum rules forbid the
existence of some of these values. the dynamics of 2+1 gravity which is
associated with the dynamics of train tracks(part i) , is reinterpreted in
terms of the emerging hyperbolic 3-manifolds .the existence of knots and
links associated with complements of these 3-manifolds is highly nontriv-
ial and requires careful proofs.the paper provides a concise introduction
into this topic.the discussion of some connections with related physi-
cal problems which could be treated with help of quadratic dierentials
is also provided.these include (but not limited to):string theory,classical
and quantum billiards,dynamics of fracture ,statics and dynamics of dis-
locations and disclinations in solids,etc.

1 introduction

in the previous paper1 (part i ) we have discussed some aspects of the the-
ory of measured foliations for 2 dimensional surfaces without providing su-
cient mathematical proofs.in this part we would like to provide a self-contained

mathematical justication of the obtained results.our presentation is deliber-
ately pedagogical enough to be accessible not only to the experts on gravity but
to the interested readers in the areas of condensed matter physics.

the theory of measured foliations is mathematically connected with the
theory of quadratic dierentials as was demonstrated by hubbard and masur2
.therefore ,we mainly will concentrate our eorts on this connection in this part
of our paper. the usefulness of the measured foliations for the description of
defects and textures in liquid crystals was recognized for some time3,4 .more re-
cently,the usefulness of quadratic dierentials for description of bosonic strings
was recognized in ref.5.additional nontrivial results for strings which involve
quadratic dierentials were obtained in ref.6.here ,we argue that the quadratic
dierentials not only naturally occur in 2+1 gravity but, in the discussion sec-
tion, we indicate that they may also be helpful in the theories of motion in
classical and quantum billiards,theories of elasticity and dynamics of fracture
,etc .in section 2 we provide an auxiliary introduction to the isoperimetric in-
equalities.although the existing monographs on quadratic dierentials do not
contain this information collected in a special section7,8 ,they ,nevertheless, as-
sume that the reader is familiar with it.we found,that for the nonexperts,the
isoperimetric inequalities provide the most natural background necessary for
understanding of the physical meaning of quadratic dierentials.although most
of the results presented in this section are known,they are scattered in the lit-
erature and this circumstance,we feel, is sucient for presentation of them in
this paper.in section 3 these results acquire new meaning when we discuss es-
sentials of quadratic dierentials. in the mathematical physics literature there
is already an excellent treatment of this topic,e.g.see ref.5 ,nevertheless,we feel
that our presentation could be considered as complementary.our discussion in
this section is subordinated to our intention to use the quadratic dierentials
in the theory of liquid crystals and gravity. applications to liquid crystals are
discussed in section 4.the results of this section are aimed to explain the phys-
ical meaning of quadratic dierentials in terms of known (to physicists)results
from the dierential geometry of surfaces with singularities.we also provide
some proofs in support of the results discussed in section 5 (part i) .in this
section the surface energy ,eq.(5.3), was used in calculations without math-
ematical justication. next,in section 5 of this part of our work we discuss
applications of quadratic dierentials to 2+1 gravity.the presentation of this
section is strongly inuenced by the seminal work ,ref.9 ,by deser ,jackiw and
t hooft. we reanalyze and extend their results using known in mathematical
literature connection between the quadratic dierentials and conical (surface)
singularities 10 .we reobtain this connection in the way somewhat dierent from
that given in ref.10 and then,we extend this connection with help of recently
obtained more comprehensive mathematical results by rivin11 .this allows us
to remove the restriction on the maximal total mass of 2+1 universe which
follows from the results of ref.9 .we also demonstrate that 2+1 gravity to some
extent can be considered as a special case of the poincare-hopf index theorem
(eq.(1.9) ,part i )and using the results of hopf 12 we argue that the masses
in such theory should take only discrete values.that is, already at the classical

2

level,we obtain a sort of quantization condition for masses.the results of this
section are elaborated in section 6 where more advanced topics are briey dis-
cussed .in particular,we argue that not only masses should be quantized but , in
addition , the obtained mass spectrum is subject to some selection rules which
forbid existence of particles with certain values of quantized masses.this re-
sult follows directly from the theory of quadratic dierentials13 .we also briey
study the eects of inclusion of the cosmological term into einsteins equa-
tions of 2+1 gravity at the classical level.this inclusion is studied from both
mathematical and physical points of view.in particular,the connection with the
nonperturbative treatment of bosonic string theory by takhtadjian14 is briey
discussed.since in part i (section 4) we had developed theory of measured fo-
liations based on the train tracks ,we provide in section 6 some connections of
this theory and the theory of teichmuller spaces in order to clarify the physical
processes which are responsible for the topology nonpreserving moves for train
tracks which are depicted in fig. 24(part i) .these processes are responsible for
phase changes (reducible,periodic,pseudo-anosov)discussed in part i. finaly,we
briey discuss how the motion in teichmuller space is related to the evolution
in the minkovski spacetime.this treatment is complementary to that developed
by moncrief15 and serves to sketch the connections between 2+1 gravity ,hyper-
bolic 3-manifolds and the theory of knots and links(for some additional gravity-
nonrelated physical applications of the theory of knots and links,please,consult
ref.16).some important auxiliary results related to knots/links and the hyper-
bolic 3-manifolds are presented in the appendix.this is motivated by the fact
,that from the mathematical standpoint,the existence of knots and links in 2+1
gravity is by no means selfobvious.in the main text we provide sucient ar-
guments in order to demonstrate the existing diculties .in the appendix we
provide some sketch of very recent mathematical results in support of the exis-
tence of knots and links in 2+1 gravity. our exposition of mathematical results
related to hyperbolic 3-manifolds is rather terse(unlike other subjects which we
treat with sucient details).nevertheless,it is included in this paper since it is
logically connected with the rest .we plan to return to these more advanced
subjects in the future publications.

additional physical problems which may be treated by the methods devel-
oped in parts i and ii are briey listed in the discussion section.these problems
include(but not restricted to):classical and quantum billiards,dynamics of frac-
ture ,dislocations in solids,temperley-lieb algebra related to meanders and its
connection with the invariants of 3-manifolds,etc.

2 some important isoperimetric inequalities

consider a closed simple (without self-intersections) planar curve c of length l
and let a be the area which is enclosed by c ,then

l2  4a ,

3

(2.1)

where the equality holds only for a circle.physical applications of this inequality
had been recently discussed in ref.17.here ,we are mainly concerned with the
methods of proving the inequality (2.1).

since analytically the length l is given by

l=

ds(cid:18) dx
d(cid:19)2

bza

d(cid:19)2
+(cid:18) dy

and the area a is known to be given by

a=-

bza

d y

dx
d

(2.2)

(2.3)

,we can use a simple identity (obtained with help of parametrization:  = 2

l s )

d"(cid:18) dx
d(cid:19)2

2z0

d(cid:19)2# =
+(cid:18) dy

2z0

d(cid:18) ds
d(cid:19)2

in order to obtain

d"(cid:18) dx
d(cid:19)2
2z0
d(cid:18)(cid:18) dx
d(cid:19) + y(cid:19)2

d"(cid:18) dy
d(cid:19)2
2z0

l2  4a=2

hence,to prove the inequality (2.1) we have to prove that

2z0

d(cid:19)2
d(cid:18) dy

2z0



d y2

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

this,however,may or may not be the case,e.g. if y=const the above inequality
certainly fails.it is rather easy to prove 18 that

theorem 1 2.1.if y( ) is a smooth function with period 2 and if

d y( ) =

0, then the inequality (2.6) holds and becomes an equality if and only if y( ) =
a cos  + b sin  ,i.e. when the trajectory is a circle(physical applications of this
fact are discussed in ref.17)

2r0

the above result (2.1) can be extended for the case when the curve may
have self-intersections.19 we are not going to need this case however.instead,we
shall consider the extension of this result to the nonat surfaces. in the case of
a sphere of radius r ,it could be shown 20 that

l2  4a -

a2
r2

(2.7)

with equality holding only for a circle on the sphere.in the case of a pseudosphere

(surface of constant negative curvature )of radius r= i , i=1 ,we obtain,

instead of (2.7),the following result:

l2
a  a + 4 .

(2.8)

obviously,if (2.8) holds ,then the inequality of the type given by (2.1) holds
as well.beacause of this, following ahlfors 21 ,let us dene the extremal length
() via

() = sup



l2()
a()

(2.9)

where  is some closed set of curves and  is the metric of the surface dened
in such a way that

and

lc () =zc

|dz|

a() =zz

2dxdy

(2.10)

(2.11)

where  is the area enclosed by the contour c  and z = x + iy .
remark 2 2.1. the above denition of () can be extended to open curves
as well if we have surfaces with boundaries.

to get a feeling of the above results ,let us consider a rectangle r with sides
a and b and let c be some curve which joins the opposite sides of the rectangle.
then,for any 

az0

 (x + iy) dx  lc ()

(2.12)

5

and,from here,

bz0

az0

dxdy  blc() .

(2.13)

with help of (2.11) and (2.13) we obtain as well

b2l2()  ab

az0

bz0

2dxdy = aba r() .

(2.14)

the above result was obtained with help of the schwarz-type inequality 22

zzr

2

  1dxdy

zzr

2dxdyzzr

dxdy  1 = abzzr

2dxdy

.

(2.15)

the inequality (2.14) produces ,in turn,

a
b 

l2()
a r()   ()

.

(2.16)

at the same time,if we choose  = 1 inside r (and  = 0 outside),then l() = a
and ab = a() so that  ()  a
b . from here we arrive at the conclusion ,that
for the rectangle r

by denition,the modulus m = b

= ( r) .

a
b
a = 1 or ,in general,

m () = inf


a()
l2()

.

with help of m we obtain for the rectangle r the following result :

a r() =zzr

2dxdy  a2m .

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

this happens to be central result for the entire development as we shall demon-
strate below in the rest of this work.to this purpose ,let us discuss the related
problem about the calculation of the modulus m for the annulus d ,i.e. doubly
connected region made of two concentric rings c1 and c2 of radius r1 < r2 .by
choosing the polar system of coordinates,we obtain ,by analogy with (2.12),

l() 

2z0

(cid:0)rei(cid:1) rd

(2.20)

for any closed curve which separates c1 and c2 .from here,

l()

and

l() ln(cid:18) r2

r1(cid:19) zzd

drd .

(2.21)

this resembles very much (2.13) and,therefore,by analogy with (2.14) we obtain
,

again,using the schwarz inequality,

2

we nally obtain,

rdrd ,

(2.23)

.

(2.24)

(2.25)

if we choose  = a
2r (where a is some parameter which is determined below,in
eq.(2.23)),then (2.25) is converted into equality with l() = a and a() =
a2

r1(cid:17) .as in the case of a rectangle ,we conclude,that

2 ln(cid:16) r2

m ( d) =

1
2

r1(cid:19) .
ln(cid:18) r2

accordingly,by analogy with (2.19) ,we can write
a( d)  l2()m ( d)

which in this case coincides obviously with eq.(2.25).

7

(2.26)

(2.27)

let us observe now that,actually,the rectangle r and the annulus d could
be mapped conformally into each other.moreover,it can be shown21 that  ()
is conformal invariant.this can be easily understood if we notice that for any
conformal mapping z  z we should have, by construction ,

and ,accordingly,the area da is dened by

|dz| = |dz|

da = 2dx  dy = 2 i

2

dz  dz = 2 i

2

dz  dez .

the invariance of da follows directly from the invariance of the length element
dl = |dz| as can be checked directly from eq.(2.29)5 clearly,the metric 
determines all surface properties.in particular,the singularities of the metric
correspond to some surface singularities (defects) as we shall demonstrate.

in the meantime,let us consider in some detail the conformal mapping of the
rectangle r onto d .to facilitate our understanding ,it is useful to visualize the
mapping,e.g.see fig.1.the mapping from plane ( d) to z-plane ( r) is being fig.1
performed by the following equation:

z = a

ln 
2i

.

(2.30)

it maps the annulus which is cut along the positive  axis into the rectangle
.the cut could be avoided if we convert the rectangle r into a cylinder of height
b (by identifying [0,ib] with [a, a + ib]).the periodicity is most explicitly seen by
rewriting eq.(2.30) in the form of

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

a (cid:19)
 = exp(cid:18) 2iz
r(cid:19)
ln(cid:18) 1

1
2

m ( d) =

so that ,obviously,(z) = (z+a). by combining eqs.(2.26) and (2.30) we obtain,

where 1

2 ln(cid:0) 1

r(cid:1) = b

a .using eq.(2.27) we obtain,
a( d)  a2m ,

which coincides exactly with the result (2.19) as anticipated.we shall need also
to use the results for an annulus d in which some curve c connects the inner
circle c1 with the outer circle c2 .simple calculation shows21

l2()
a() 

1
2

r1(cid:19) .
ln(cid:18) r2

if,as before,we choose r2 = 1 and r1 = r ,then we obtain ,

m =

a
b

,

2

r(cid:1) =
ln(cid:0) 1

8

(2.35)

(2.36)

so that ,as before, a( d)  b2 m = ab.
the duality between the results (2.23) and (2.36) happens to be very impor-
tant as we shall demonstrate in section 4. in the meantime,we need to introduce
the concept of a quadratic dierential.this is accomplished in the next section.

3 some essentials about quadratic dierentials

let us begin with eq.(2.31).using this equation we obtain the following sequence
of results

d =

2i
a

dz  dz =

a
2i

d
  (dz)2 = 

a2

(d)2

(2)2

2

(3.1)

the last expression represents the rst example of a quadratic dierential.more
formaly,we provide the following

denition 3 3.1. let z = f (z) be some coformal mapping of the domain d
onto d and let (z) be some function wich transforms as

dz(cid:19)2
(z) = (z)(cid:18) dz

, z = f (z),

(3.2)

then the expression (z) (dz)2 is called quadratic dierential.

from (3.2) it follows,that this quantity is invariant with respect to mappings

:z  z ,i.e.

(z) (dz)2 = (z) (dz)2 .

(3.3)

eq.(3.1) represents just an example of general result given by eq.(3.3).comparison
between eq.s(2.28) and (3.3) suggests us to introduce

denition 4 3.2. the dierential |dw| = |(z)|
element ( length)

associated with .

1

2 |dz| is called the lenght

remark 5 3.1.a)in terms of |dw| the length is just the usual euclidean length
;b)(z) can be identied ,in principle, with |(z)|
2 but this association is actualy
formal as we shall explain below ,in section 4 .

1

from the above discussion it follows,in particular,that

suppose,that there is another w such that

1  (dw)2 = (z) (dz)2

1  (d w)2 = (z) (dz)2 .

9

(3.4)

(3.5)

then,clearly, w = w + const. moreover,by taking a square root of eq.(3.4) we
obtain,

from here,we obtain as well

dw
dz

w = (z) =

zz dzp(z) .
=p(z).

(3.6)

(3.7)

this is the dierential equation on the complex plane or on the riemann sur-
face,etc. the ow lines of this equation were used extensively in part i of this
work.now ,we would like to provide some additional details. to this purpose
,let us consider quadratic dierential of the type

2 (cid:19)2
(dw)2 =(cid:18) n + 2

zn (dz)2

(3.8)

where n is some integer (n 1). use of eq.(3.6) provides us with the result,

or

w = (z) = z

n+2

2 ,

dw
dz

2 (cid:19) z
=(cid:18) n + 2

n

2 .

(3.9)

(3.10)

eq.(3.9) is a typical example of a conformal mapping.for such mapping ,with
respect to the origin of z-plane, the whole z-plane is subdivided into sectors
(n 1)

2

n + 2

k  arg z 

2

n + 2

(k + 1), k = 0, 1, ..., n + 1,

(3.11)

such that when arg z covers one of these sectors,the resulting image covers either
the upper or the lower w-plane.if we consider the set of parallel lines(parallel to
re w axis in w-plane), im w = an, a = const, n = 0, 1, 2, ...,these parallel lines go
into parallel lines  in one of the sectors of z-plane so that for the y-type sin-
gularity we obtain the result depicted in fig.2.in the case of a thorn ,n=-1 ,and fig.2
we have the mapping of the whole z-plane (with cut along x 0 axis) into the
upper w-plane. the horizontals in w-plane go into the horizontals in z-plane
as depicted in fig.3.straightening of the ow lines explains the reason of the fig.3
word measured foliations introduced in part i(e.g.see fig.21 of part i).from
the examples of the previous section it follows ,that the singularities producing
poles of order >2 are not acceptable since if we identify |(z)| with 2(z),then
the area,eq.(2.11), becomes divergent.this means,in particular,that the singu-
larities depicted in fig.4 and known in the literature on liquid crystals23 are

10

mathematicaly ill-dened(see also the next section for additional details).the fig.4
singularities for which n > 1 are permissible,in principle, and could be consid-
ered along the lines similar to that discussed in part i (see ref.24 and section 6
below).

all mathematically permissible quadratic dierentials can be brought into

the standard form as follows.consider the mapping

(z) = exp(cid:18) 2i

l

(z)(cid:19) .

(3.12)

it is analogous to eq.(2.31) and l is  length of the quadratic dierential
(z). by analogy with eq.(3.1) ,we have now

d =

2i
l

p(z)dz  (z) (dz)2 = 

l2

(2)2

(d)2

2

(3.13)

the ow lines of such dened quadratic dierential are the concentric cir-
cles (fig.4 ,part i).this is very important result since it allows to map an
arbitrary mathematicaly permissible quadratic dierential into the standard
dierential,eq.(3.1) (or (3.13)),so that the rest of the arguments related to the
annulus and the rectangle presented in section 2 could be carried through with-
out change.

the above results can be broadly generalized now.to this purpose let us take
another look at eq.(3.12).what we actually have is a mapping from some rie-
mann surface r on which the quadratic dierential lives into the surface of the
at annulus.clearly,such mapping has some limitations.that is , it might as well
be that the above mapping exist only for some ring domain |z| =  on r .the size
of this domain determines the size of the annulus (or punctured disk).without
going into intricate details about the correspondence of thee domains25,26 we
provide

theorem 6 3.1.if  is quadratic dierential which can have closed trajectories
on r with respective lengths li ,then its characteristic ring domains (i.e.the
maximal ring domains swept out by the closed trajectories cover r up to a set
of measure zero.for a holomorphic quadratic dierential on a compact surface
of genus g 2 the number of characteristic ring domains is at most 3g-3.

proof. please,consult refs.7,8,25,26 (cid:3).
let us explain what all this actually means.it is well known 27, that every
riemann surface r could be decomposed into set of 2g-2 pants.conversely,if we
have at our disposal a set of 2g-2 pants ,we can restore r if we have a 3-valent
planar graph with 2g-2 vertices and 3g-3 edges which does not have free ends.3g-
3 edges correspond to cylinders made when the pants are glued together.all this
is depicted in fig.5.since we have discussed already the problems which involve fig.5
cylinders,e.g.see fig.1 ,it becomes clear why we have discussed them in the rst
place.moreover,the ring domains form the union of closed geodesics(lamination
,according to the denition 4.1.of part i),one for each of these cylinders2729

11

.and,when these geodesics are projected into the open disk d2,as discussed in
section 4 ,part i, we obtain the projective meanders.

with this background ,we are ready now for some applications of these re-

sults..

4 applications of quadratic dierentials to tex-

tures in liquid crystals

in the previous sections we have provided essential mathematical background
related to quadratic dierentials.before we actualy use them (in this and the
following sections) it is desirable to provide some relevant physical background
related to quadratic dierentials.

4.1 4.1.dierential geometric meaning of quadratic dier-

entials

we have introduced the length ,eq.(2.28),and the area ,eq.(2.29), and identied
with  and |(z)| with 2 .this,however,is not enough.here we shall
|(z)|
explain why.
although the cartan method of description of surfaces is the most elegant
and economical,moreover,it is indispensable for the discussion of general topo-
logical properties of surfaces30 ,we shall avoid its use here for the reasons which
will become obvious upon reading.

let r be the point in r3 which belongs to some surface s. then,on one hand,
r is just some 3d euclidean vector with components r1 ,r2 ,and r3 and,on the
other hand,because it belongs to the surface ,its location on the surface could
be given in terms of some local coordinates x1,x2  s. with such dened r it is
useful to construct two vectors dr
so that the induced metric of the
dx1
surface is given by

and dr

(4.16)

which coincides with the transformation rule for the quadratic dierentials,eq.(3.3).hence
 is the quadratic dierential! moreover,the equation for the principal curva-
tures,eq.(4.9) ,can now be rewritten in compact suggestive form as

which is equivalent to

for the umbilic point n > 0 and  is nonsingular for k1 6= k2. in addition,for
k1 6= k2 we may have singular  (then we may have n < 0). to calculate the
index of such singularity explicitly,we use known fact of complex analysis 31

this produces,in view of eq.s (4.21) and (4.23),

i(p) =

n = 1,2, ...

(4.23)

(4.23a)

denition 7 4.1.we shall call eq.(4.23a) the hopf quantization rule .

this result for the index produces exactly the results obtained for the liquid
crystals,e.g. see section 1(part i) or ref.23. in the case of y-type singularity
,we have, according to strebel7, n = +1,which produces iy =  1
2 in accord with
fig.2 of part i. for the case of a thorn,we have n = 1, which produces ii = 1
2
again, in complete accord with fig.2 of part i and with refs.12,32.the index
for the rest of singularities can be computed now analogously.

remark 8 4.1. poincare39 had originally considered singularities of dieren-
tial equations of the form

a(x, y)dx + b(x, y)dy = 0

(4.24)

this is just the condition of orthogonality between the vector (a, b) and the curve
(dx, dy). by going around a closed curve c the direction of the vector (a, b) can
change only by 2n where n is an integer.hence,by having half integer values for
i is equivalent of not having vector elds on the surfaces.this was actually
stated in part i(section 1) without proof.

4.2 4.2.quadratic dierentials and the textures in liquid

crystals

the fact that the textures in liquid crystals can be associated with measured
foliations was recognized already by poenaru3 and langevin 4 .the fact that the
measured foliations are asssociated with quadratic dierentials was explained by
hubbard and masur2.a comprehensive treatment of measured foliations could
be found in refs.24,35.here ,we only provide some details to make this identi-
cation complete.before doing so ,we would like to mention that the results below
are equally applicable to any kind of hyperbolic paper(the terminology used
by thurston 36 )that is to any surface which may develop some crumples(see
also section 7).

the free energy of distortion fd in the case of nematics (in one constant

approximation) is given by 37

fd =

1
2

kz d3r (n)2

(4.24)

where the coupling constant k has dimensionality energy/cm and is related
eectively to the surface tension.the coupling constant k exibits therefore no-
ticeable temperature dependence.the unit vector n=n(r) is known in the liter-
ature on liquid crystals as director. on one hand,it is being used to describe
the orientation of the individual molecule (usually very sti,rod-like, organic
molecule of not too high molecular weight)with respect to some preassigned
xed axis,on another hand,n in eq.(4.24) is also called a director although
it is no longer is directly associated with the individual molecule.it is possi-
ble,however,to obtain the macroscopic distortion energy fd from the underlying
microscopic molecular model of nematic liquid crystal38 .one is usually looking
for a minimum of fd under the additional constraint :n2 = 1(the nonlinear
sigma model39). in mathematical literature 40,41 ,the same problem is stated
|x| = n, x u r3 (the do-
somewhat more precisely.. specically,let (x) = x
main u may coincide with r3).let {hi} be k disjoint compact subsets of u
which are called holes.(x) is the gauss map  : u s 2 in the absence of
holes.in the presence of holes,consider a spherical neighborhood around some
particular hi.if  is restricted to this neighborhood,then,with such restriction,
denes a map s 2  s2. this map has a degree di  z (integers,possibly includ-
ksi=1
ing zero).if now  = u\(
hi), then one is interested in nding the harmonic
map  :   s2 ,that is to nd

d3x ()2

(4.25)

e = inf

z

under conditions (i=1-k)

 = {  (; s2) | deg(; hi) = di, z

d3x ()2 < }.

16

the above problem can be formulated as well in two dimensions.in this case ,one
is talking about the harmonic maps from s1 to s1.for di which are integers
di = 0 the problem is solved in ref.42 with the

result :

and satisfy the condition pi
d2x ()2 = xi<j

2z

1

e =

didj ln|ai  aj| + boundary term +const (4.26)

where {ai} play the same role as {hi} in 3 dimensions.this result provides the
desired coulomb gas analogy used for the description of the defect mediated
melting transitions in quasi two dimensional liquid crystals 43 via the kosterlitz-
thouless type of transition which was discussed in part i.

from the same physical literature it is known,however,23,37.43 that the
defects with integer di are topologicaly unstable (at least in r3) and only those
which have the half integer di are topologicaly stable.

remark 9 4.2. in two dimensions the degree di coincides with the index i.

remark 10 4.3.in two dimensions ,in view of the remark 4.1.,if we would
have stable defects with integer and halnteger i we would run into problem
since the textures originating from defects with integer i produce the orientable
(vector) elds on the surface while the defects with half integer i produce the
non-orientable (line) elds.according to strebels book,ref.7,in this case one
should consider the eld of textures (foliations) coming from defects with integer
index i as non-orientable line eld.1*

the quadratic dierential,eq.(3.1) ,describes the defect with i = 1 and is
depicted in fig.4b) of part i,while the same dierential with a  ia is also
having index i = 1 and is depicted in fig.2 of part i.the very existence of the
whitehead moves ,fig.4 ,part i,would be questionable should both integer and
halnteger elds not be treated as the line elds7.

as in the case of 2+1 gravity (to be discussed in section 5),because the line
elds are nonorientable,there is no interaction between the defects but there is
an energy,nevertheless. and this energy can be minimized.

indeed,in two dimensions we have n={ cos (r), sin (r)}, r ={x, y}. this

produces,instead of eq.(4.24),the following result for the distortion energy

fd =

k

2 z

d2r ()2

(4.27)

where the domain  is analogous to that dened in eq.(4.25) (adjusted for
2-dimensional case).the functional d[] = 2
kfd is known in the literature as
1*in the case of 2+1 gravity ,section 5,such remark is equivalent of saying that use of
quadratic dierentials allows to provide a formal unication of the description of electicity
and gravity .such unication is completely dierent in nature from that proposed by kaluza
and klein.please,see also section 6.2.

dirichlet integral44. this integral has some remarkable properties summarized
in the following theorems

the domain  onto  and let (x, y) = (f (z)), then

proof. indeed,taking into account that

x = uux + vvx

y = uuy + vvy

and empoloying the cauchy-riemann equations
ux = vy ,vx = uy

we obtain,

y =(cid:0)2

is the image of the area  upon the conformal mapping w = f (z).

| w| 6= 0.

proof. please,consult ref.21.(cid:3)

in view of theorem 4.1.

,our use of isoperimetric inequalities ,discussed
in section 2,and quadratic dierentials ,discussed in section 3 ,becomes almost
obvious.since d[] has the meaning of an area , we can write as well (in view
of eq.(2.29)):

d[] =zz

2()dx  dy

where now

2() = 2

x + 2

y .

(4.36)

(4.37)

as for the length l ,it should be dened accordingly through |dw|=|dz| .
then,the isoperimetric inequalities discussed in section 2 can be used immedi-
atly.as for the theorem 4.2.,we shall need it later,in section 6,when we shall
discuss some more advanced topics.for the time being ,we need to discuss how
to obtain  from 2 given by eq.(4.37).to this purpose ,following ref.8 ,let us
introduce the function gz = 1
2 (gx  igy) and such that g = u + i .further-
more,let

where the above equation denes . consider now

gz =p(z)

2i

consider as well the contour integral along some closed curve    given by

|(x  uy) dx + (ux  y) dy|

.

(4.40)

if the function gz is analytic(holomorphic),then the cauchy-riemann equations
produce :ux = y and uy = x which leads us to the conclusion that

i (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)im(dz)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =i

|d|

(4.41)

where |d| = |xdx + ydy| . at the same time,the same cauchy-riemann equa-
tions applied to eq.(4.39) produce

d[] =zz (cid:0)2

x + 2

y(cid:1) dxdy = a().

(4.42)

19

although thus dened construction had provided us with the area a() ,the
contour integral

h() =i

|d|

(4.43)

h (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

is not exactly the length.it is called the height(the length is just

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)|dz|).if we are looking for the extremum of (4.42) ,we cannot apply di-

rectly the results of section 2.to nd out the geometric meaning of the height
,it is sucient to go back to fig.1,and to use the remark 3.1. along with
eq.(3.4).since (dw)2 in eq.(3.4) is just the usual euclidean length element ,this
means ,that in terms of w we have to consider some square ,e.g.
like that de-
picted in fig.1,with im w = b being indeed the height of the square.eq.(4.41)
reects just this fact.suppose ,as in fig.1 ,we have an annulus and inside of
the annulus we have a closed curve which touches both the inner and the outer
circle.then,the image of this curve in w-plane will also be a closed curve which
touches the horizontals .this curve,naturaly,will have some horizontal and ver-
tical parts.if the height of the rectangle is b,then we obtain ,

where (u, ) denotes any smooth curve which joins the horizontals and bu
represents the contour.multiplying both sides of (4.44) by a we obtain,

h() = b zbu

finaly,using the theorem 4.1. ,we obtain ,

y(cid:3) dxdy .

of course,in the above derivation we had made a restriction of having just one
puncture in .we have eectively surrounded the puncture (the critical point
or the singularity) by a circle and considered the domain  as an annulus which
was converted into the rectangle (as usual).evidently,the generalization to many

20

singularities should be obvious now.the combination ab can be written therefore
as follows:

ab = b2 m = b2/m = a2m = a2/ m

(4.48)

,where m is given by eq.(2.26) and m = m 1 according to eq.(2.35).using these
results we can write our nal expression for the distortion energy,eq.(4.27),for
a set of punctures:

fd 

k

2 xi

a2
i mi

(4.49)

where ai is equal to |i(pi)| as can be seen from eq.(4.23)(or page 14(top)of
ref.21). additional details related to the choice of domains,structure of tra-
jectories of quadratic dierentials,etc.,could be found in ref.45 which does not
contain any physical applications however .eq.(4.49) coincides with eq.(5.3) (see
also eq.(2.5))of part i where it was given without proof.

remark 14 4.2.the existence of the hexagonally ordered phases discussed in
part i,e.g. see figs 8 and 10 of part i,can be easily understood based on the
results just obtained.indeed,let us surround each defect with simple (non self-
intersecting) contour c and consider an area which is enclosed by such con-
tour.now ,the problem can be formulated as follows:for a given perimeter length
l of the contour c nd a minimal area a which such contour encloses ,provided
that the obtained gure can cover the surface s without gaps (i.e. tesselates s).
for r2 , s2and r the results are well known46.in particular,for r2 there are only
two options : to have squares or to have equilateral triangles.for given perime-
ter length l the area a of the triangle is smaller than that of the square.hence,
triangles tesselate r2 under the most optimal conditions and this is the origin
of the existence of the hexatic phase .for the alternative (physical) proof of the
existence of the hexatic phase, please,consult ref.47.

5 applications to 2+1 gravity

although in the previous sections we have provided all necessary essentials
needed for the description of classical 2+1 gravity,here we need some rami-
cations of the obtained results to facilitate the uninterrupted reading.

5.1 5.1.conical singularities and quadratic dierentials

the connection between the conical singularities and quadratic dierentials was
discovered by troyanov10.his derivation is incomplete,however,as was recently
noticed by rivin11. because of this incompleteness,we would like to provide here
an alternative derivation of troyanovs results in order to make connections with
that of rivin.

21

the main idea of both works lies in the recognition of the fact that any
2 dimensional riemann surface (and also 3 dimensional manifold 36) admits
consistent triangulation with help of at euclidean triangles.the curvature
eects are concentrated then on vertices (cones) of the triangulated surface.
if the surface is without boundary(closed),then the curvature singularities are
well modelled by the cones on at euclidean backgroundsif the surface has
boundaries,then some of the singularities should be modelled by the punc-
tured(truncated) cones11,48 .surfaces which have negative euler characteristics
are hyperbolic and,whence,they represent an example of a hyperbolic paper(in
thurstons terminology36) .since the hyperbolicity is always associated with
tractrix-like conical -type surfaces(e.g.see fig.6)17,36 and since such surfaces
cannot be smoothly embedded into 3 dimensional euclidean space,e.g.see the-
orem 7.1. below and refs 36,46,the very tip of the cone may be cut o.this
creates a boundary ( for an illustration,please,consult ref.48,especialy pages
98,99)since the cone is being truncated now.the euler characteristic of such tri-
angulated surfaces with truncated cones could be calculated with some eort11
thus providing the major correction to the results of troyanov.this correction
,naturaly,is aecting the results related to 2+1 gravity as we shall demonstrate
shortly below.consider now the following

lemma 15 5.1.suppose we have the quadratic dierential which has the in-
nitesimal length dl2 given by

then , there is a conical metric given by

dl2 = |z|2 |dz|2 ,   1,

dl2 = dr2 + r2dt2 ,0  t  2 ,0    1,

(5.1)

(5.2)

so that (5.1) can be mapped into (5.2) provided that  = 1 +  and  = 
 being an angle of the cone.

2 with

n+2

proof. we had seen already in section 3,e.g.see eq.s (3.9),(3.11)and fig.2.
converts the sector 0 arg z  2
,that the maping of the type w=z
n+2
in z-plane into the upper w half plane.if we identify the sides of this sector
,we shall obtain a cone with an angle 2
n+2 . clearly,the metric dl2 in w-plane is
euclidean,i.e.dl2=dx2 + dy2 = dr2 + r2d2. when going from w to z-plane ,we
anticipate that the metric will have the form given by eq.(4.6).to calculate the
conformal factor  ,let us consider in the light of just presented example the
transformation:

x = ar cos  , y = ar sin  .

(5.3)

using these results, we obtain

dx = ar1dr cos   ar(sin )d,
dy = ardr sin  + ar(cos )d.

22

based on these results,we arrive at

dx2 + dy2 = a22r2(1)(dr2 + r2d2).

(5.4)

if we demand that a22 = 1, this then allows us to get rid of a .next ,we look at
eq.(5.1) and recall that |dz|2 = dx2 + dy2 = dr2 + r2d2 and r = |z| . whence,in
view of eq.(5.4),we arrive at the result:

  1 = .

furthermore,if we perform the following rescaling:

t =  , = 1r,

(5.5)

(5.6)

then the metric given by eq.(5.4) is converted into that given by eq.(5.2) with
  r. clearly,it makes sense to choose  = 
where  is the cone an-
2
gle.then,eq.(5.5) produces:

 = 2( + 1)

(5.7)

in complete agreement with the result of troyanov10 where it was obtained in
a somewhat dierent way.(cid:3)

corollary 16 5.1. by employing the results of hopf,e.g.
(4.23), we obtain the index of the quadratic dierential:

see eq.s (4.21)-

i(pi) = 1  i = 1 

i
2

= i .

(5.8)

corollary 17 5.2.the poincare-hopf index theorem,eq.(1.9),part i, can now
be written at once as

 =xi

(1 

i
2

).

(5.9)

this result is also in agreement with that obtained in ref.10 where,again,it was
obtained dierently.

since troyanov is not using hopfs arguments explicitly,there is no restriction
on i(pi) to be an integer or halnteger (e.g.see denition 4.1.)in his work.we
also (only for a moment!) will suppress this restriction in order to discuss some
known facts about classical 2+1 gravity .

conversely,one can arrive at correct einstein equations starting from
the p-h theorem.
in this case,by the way,there is no need to invoke the
equivalence principle as it is traditionaly done .accordingly,there is no need to
worry about the justication of the mach principle 2* since eq.(5.14) is auto-
maticaly in accord with it.this becomes especialy evident in view of the mass

this result is in complete accord with the results of deser, jackiw and t hooft ,
ref.9 ,where somewhat dierent set of arguments was employed to arrive at the
above equation.taking into account lemma 5.1 ,we obtain as well the following
result for the metric:

dl2 =yi

|z  zi|2i |dz|2 ,

(5.17)

where 2i = 8gmi in view of eqs (5.5) and (5.16).this result is also in agree-
ment with that obtained in ref.9.
consider now a special case of eq.(5.14): g=0 .then eq.s (5.5) and (5.9)

produce the following constraint on i :

xi

i = 2 .

(5.18)

following troyanov10, let us consider the change of variables in eq.(5.17):
w=z1. this produces

|dz|2 = |dw|2
|w|4

and

yi

|z  zi|2i =yi

collecting all terms together ,we obtain for the metric

|w|2i |1  wzi|2i = |w|4yi
dl2 =yi

|1  wzi|2i |dw|2

|1  wzi|2i

.

(5.19)

.

(5.20)

this result was obtained with account of the constraint ,eq.(5.18).hence,the
metric dl2 is regular at innity,w=0, and maintains the same form as given
in eq.(5.17).this result should hold under the restriction that i cannot be-
come negative in view of eq.(5.2).this happens to be a very serious restric-
tion.indeed,according to eq.(5.14) for the case of g=0 and just for one mass m
we obtain

using this value of mass in eq.(5.16) we also obtain ,

1 = 2gm .

 = 1  4g 

1
2g

= 1 .

25

(5.21)

(5.21)

this is not permissible,however,since it contradicts eq.(5.2). moreover,let g > 0
in eq.(5.14),then we obtain

xi

mi  0 ,g > 0 .

(5.22)

this result is ,apparently ,meaningless as well since we expect our masses to be
nonnegative.

so far ,we have not imposed an additional constraint coming from the hopf
quantization rule,denition 4.1.if we constrain our indices to the (half)integers
,then we obtain the following mass quantization condition :

4gmi =(cid:26) 1

1
2

.

(5.23)

in the rst case we have the degenerate case , = 0, according to eq.(5.16) ,and
in the second ,we obtain ,  = 1
2 which produces prong-type singularity,e.g. see
fig.2 of part i which has the index 1
2 .

so far ,we have not invoked more recent results obtained by rivin11.if we

use his results,then instead of eq.(5.9) ,we obtain (i > 0) :

 = xvi /s

(1 

i
2

) +

1

2 xvj s

(1 

i


)

(5.24)

where the rst sum runs ,as before,over the conical singularities while the second
runs over the truncated(punctured ) conical singularities.the above extension
of troyanovs results in spite of its simple look is highly nontrivial and is not
straightforwardly obtainable.this result becomes especially useful if we would
like to remove the restriction on the total mass of our universe,e.g. for g=0
using eq.(5.15) we obtain ,

1
2g

=xi

mi ,

(5.25)

in accord with ref.9.to remove this restriction, let us consider ,for example,how
eq.(5.24) works for a disk d2 (evidently , s2can be obtained by gluing two disks)
.if the boundary sum is ignored and only the nondegenerate cone angles are
considered,then, in agreement with the results of part i ,we should have 2 thorn-
like singularities using the quantizaton condition (5.23) and the fact that for the
disc (d2) = 1. we can place yet another thorn on d2 if we use the boundary
sumterm.without violating the requirement i > 0 and requiring i
 to be a
positive integer13, we obtain the rst nontrivial result for i
 = 2 which produces
the desired - 1
2 factor characteristic of y-type defects (fig.2,part i).the rest of
the arguments used in part i now can go through without change so that the
restriction for the total mass can now be removed. evidently,the extension
of these results to higher genus surfaces becomes also possible without any
problems.

26

remark 18 5.1. at this point it is appropriate to remind the reader that
even for the coulombic charges on s2 the topology requires only two charges in
order for the p-h theorem to be satised(e.g.see section 1 ,part i).this is com-
pletely analogous to the total mass restriction ,eq.(5.25), for the case
of gravity.the electroneutrality requirement emerges naturally if we want to put
the additional charges on s2 .moreover,although we actually can put only the
sources(+) and the sinks(-) on s2 ,the presence of these additional
singularities (both having index +1) automatically creates the induced
sad-
dles (with index -1).something similar occurs in the case of gravity because of
an extra boundary sum term (rivin sum term).

remark 19 5.2.the presence of such boundary term(s) becomes obvious if
one wants to consider eq.(5.14) for surfaces of genus g higher (or equal) than
mi = 0 (electroneu-

one.since for g=1 the l.h.s. of (5.14) is zero,we obtain :pi
obtainpi

trality) which is of limited use (photons,neutrinos,etc)for gravity.for g > 1 we
mi < 0 and this is physically problematic (please,see note added in

proof at the end of this paper).

remark 20 5.3.in the original work by troyanov10there is no restriction on
i to be in the range between 0 and 1.it can be any positive integer or halnte-
ger(denition 4.1).under such conditions the relation given by eq.(5.9) becomes
correct for surfaces of any genus.unfortunately,it cannot be used for gravity
for reasons explained above.

remark 21 5.4.it is useful to recall why altogether one should be concerned
with surfaces of higher genus in the case of 2+1 gravity.following petrov51, einstein
spaces are characterized by the condition:

rij = gij .

(5.26)

since the scalar curvature r = ri
eliminated with the result:

i = gikrik ,the constant  in eq.(5.26) can be

rij =

r
d

gij,

(5.27)

where d is the dimensionality of space-time.using this result ,einstein ten-
sor,eq.(5.11), can be rewritten as

g

 =(cid:18) 1

d 

1

2(cid:19) 

 r

so that the covariant derivative of both sides of eq.(5.10) produces

g

, = 0 .

27

(5.28)

(5.29)

since t 
account of eq.(5.28) ) as

, = 0 by construction,eq.(5.29) can be equivalently rewritten (with

(cid:18) 1

d 

1

2(cid:19) r, = 0 .

(5.30)

for d 6= 2 we have to study spaces of constant curvature called einsein spaces.for
d=2 (that is for the xed time slice) we have no choice but to conclude that any
two dimensional surface is einstein space.but any two dimensional surface is
the riemann surface 46.

6 some more advanced topics:a brief discussion

6.1 6.1. inclusion of the cosmological term

einsteins eq.(5.10) is written without the cosmological constant  term.this
deciency can be easily corrected.by multiplying both sides of eq.(5.10) by 
and taking into account that9

g0

0 =

1
2

r

(6.1)

and r/2 = k (eq.(4.4)) where,for the metric given by dl2 = |dz|2 , the gauss
curvature k is known to be52

k = 

2


2 ln 
z z

.

using these results along with eq.s(5.10) and (6.2) we obtain,

2
z z

+


2

exp  = 8gxi

mi2(z  zi)

(6.2)

(6.3)

where  = exp  .for  = 1 and 8gmi = 1 the above equation coincides with
the liouville equation discussed by takhtadjian14 in connection with the non-
perturbative approach to string theory.accordingly,quantization of 2+1 gravity
and 1+1 string theory are related to each other as it was noticed already by
witten53.consider now the louville equation in the punctured complex plane
that is in c\{z1, ..., zn},and let  be some positive constant.this case (actually
corresponding to the punctured sphere s2) was treated in ref.54. the authors
of ref.54 were able to prove the following
theorem 22 6.1.the liouville equation 2 =  exp(2) in the punctured
complex plane +{} has solution.near each puncture the solution is represented
by (z) = i ln|z  zi| +harmonic function.the constants i = i
2  1 and
satisfy the restriction:

xi

i  2

28

(6.4)

and

xi6=j

i  j < 0 for all j = 1, ..., n.

(6.5)

corollary 23 6.1.from the above theorem it follows ,that the results of troyanov10
(and rivin11) in the light of the results presented in the previous section, it ap-
pears ,that a similar proof can be oallow us to by-pass solution of the louville
eq. (6.3) (at least for the case of s2).

in the light of the results obtainedin the previous section,it appears,that a
similar proof can be obtained for  < 0 as well.this is,however,not the case
due to the results of mcowen55 .his results are analogous to that discussed by
takhtadjian14.moreover,the same results were obtained much earlier by nevan-
lina(e.g.see pages 249-250 of ref.56 and take into account the very minor ty-
pos,e.g.sign errors,etc).the dierence between treatments of  > 0 and  < 0
cases deserves further study in the light of troyanovs results

6.2 6.2. some sum rules

although the poincare-hopf index theorem plays the major role in study of
topology of two dimensional surfaces,sometimes,additional ramications are re-
quired. let us begin with

lemma 24 6.1.if the quadratic dierential has poles with the total order p and
zeros (including their multiplicity) of total order q,then for the riemann surface
of genus g with n boundary components we must have

p  q = 4  4g  2n.

(6.6)

proof. consider rst the case of n=0.then,taking into account eqs(4.21)-

(4.23)and using the p-h theorem,eq.(1.9),part i,we obtain,

xpoles

ni  xzeros

nj = 2(2  2g)

.

let now we have n boundary components.these can be obtained in the following
way.consider a sphere s2 with g handles and add one additional handle so
that the genus of the surface becomes g+1.let us now squeeze the additional
handle so that it breaks into 2 pieces leaving 2 punctures on s2.hence,we obtain
the correspondence: g  2n .according to jenkins57 (see also rivin 11) the
boundary zeros are necessarily of even order .therefore,instead of having
2(2  2g)  4n we obtain the result (6.6).(cid:3)
because the quadratic dierentials are transforming like tensors of rank 2
,e.g.see eq.(3.2),one may ask a question: under what conditions they can be

29

formed out of the product of the abelian dierentials?following ref.13 ,for the
riemann surface r ,let ki be the order of zero at some pi  r and let ,for
example,ki = 1 if at pi we have a simple pole(a prong-like singularity),etc
,then each quadratic dierential  is associated with the set of data (k1, ..., kn; )
where  = +1 if  is the square of the abelian dierential and  = 1 if it is
not.one can prove the following

theorem 25 6.2.let k = (k1, ..., kn; ) where ki  {1, 1, 2, ...} and  = 1.
then,for a closed surface r there is  realizing k if and only if

a)(k) = 0 mod 4, (k)  4 and (k) =
b) = 1 if any ki
c)(k1, ..., kn; ) 6= (4;1), (1, 3;1), (1, 1;1) or (

is odd and

;-1).

ki ;

npi=1

proof. please,consult ref.13.(cid:3)
in the case if we are interested under what conditions the pseudo-anosov
regime of surface homeomorphisms is possible,the following theorem could be
also of major importance.to formulate this theorem we have to provide the
following denition rst.

denition 26 6.1.the 1-prong is thorn-like ( a simple pole) singularity,the 3-
prong is y-type (a simple zero)singularity .the p-prong is the singularity with
p arms24 .the data set could be realized in terms of the prong numbers pi :
(p1, ..., pn; ).

theorem 27 6.3.there is a pseudo-anosov homeomorphism on r of genus g
and n punctures realizing the data (p1, ..., pj; ) if and only if

jpi=1

(pi  2) = 4(g  1),
a)
b) = 1 if any pi is odd,
c)(p1, ..., pj; ) 6= (6;1), (3, 5;1), (1, 3;1) or ( ;-1).
d) the number of indices i for which pi = 1 is less than or equal to n (that

is

the thorns may be sitting at the punctures).

proof. please,consult ref.13.(cid:3)

remark 28 6.1. theorems 6.2 and 6.3 provide some additional selection rules
which should be taken into account when the mass spectrum of 2+1 gravity is of
interest.they do not follow trivialy from the p-h theorem.

6.3 6.3. connections with the theory of teichmuller spaces

in this subsection we would like to discuss briey under what physical condi-
tions it is possible to anticipate the transitions from the periodic to the pseudo-
anosov regime.these results are complementary to that presented in section 5
of part i.

30

we have encountered a glimpse of the teichmuller theory in section 4.2.from
it,we realize that we are in the domain of the teichmuller theory as soon as
instead of the conformal mapping (for which  w = 0) we are dealing with the
quasiconformal (for which  w 6= 0). the length element given by eq.(4.1) can
be brought into form58

where

and

dl2 = (z, z)|dz + (z)dz|2

,

dz(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(6.7)

(6.8)

(6.9)

in notations of section 4.1.at the same time,the length element given by eq.(4.1)
can be brought into the conformal form given by eq.(4.6).using eq.(4.6) ,let
w = x1 + ix2  u + iv .then, we have as well ,

if now w = w(z, z), we obtain ,

where ,as before,wz = 

z w ,etc .comparison between eqs.(6.7)-(6.9) produces:

this result coincides with eq.(3.2) as required.comparison between eqs.(6.7)
and (6.9) produces as well

(z, z) = |wz|2 .

(6.10)

(z) =

wz
wz

.

(6.11)

this is known as beltrami equation. if wz = 0, then  = 0 and the mapping
is conformal.looking at eq.(4.35) we can write as well 29

|(z)| 

k  1
k + 1

< 1.

(6.12)

either|| or k determine the amount of stretching the surface undergoes(this
strething can include twisting as well).

let us now introduce notations:

(z)  w(z)

if  is dened through eq.(6.11),

kw =

1 + |w(z)|
1  |w(z)|

=

1 + k
1  k

, 0 < k < 1.

(6.13)

using these notations one can prove the following

31

theorem 29 6.4. let  be some quadratuc dierential on r ,then

w(z) = k

(z)
|(z)|

(6.14)

where  means the complex conjugate.

proof. please, consult ref.59.(cid:3)

denition 30 6.2. a dieomorphism (posibly with isolated singularities) f :
r  r is admissible if

kf  k[f ] <  .

(6.15)

theorem 31 6.4.in order for dieomorphism to be admissible ,we have to re-
quire

k[f  f ] = [k[f ]]2 .

(6.16)

proof. please,consult ref.60.(cid:3)

corollary 32 6.4.using theorem 6.4.
it is straightforward to show that if
|f (z)| = k (see eq.(6.14)) ,then |f f (z)| = 2k/(1 + k2). by combining eq.s
(6.13)-(6.16) we observe that if k[f ] was initialy > 1,then

k[f  f ] = [k[f ]]2 > k[f ] > 1.

whence, successive dilatations lead to the successive stretching.this fact
leads to the most profound implications reected in the following theorem and
corollaries that follow.

theorem 33 6.5.let  be associated with the admissible map f of r . if 
has only a nite number of critical points ,then  has no saddle connections
(critical trajectories running between these critical points) . in particular,every
trajectory of  is dense in r .

proof. assume that after some iteration

we had been

f m = f      f
{z
}m

|

able to x all saddle connections.then,on one hand,the length between them
should remain the same as it was initially and,on another hand,in view of
eq.(6.16) the length has expanded by the factor of k m
2 > 1.this contradic-
tion proves the theorem . consequently ,every trajectory of  is dense in r
(otherwise ,there would be saddle connections).(cid:3)

corollary 34 6.5.a) the theorem 6.5. indicates that the existence of the me-
andritic labyrinths ,discussed in part i, is possible only if the surface undergoes
some stretching.hence , the stretching is needed to destroy the reducible and
periodic phases and to create the pseudo-anosov phase.

32

corollary 35 6.5.b)if the riemann surface r has some boundaries which are
pointwise xed,then there is no admissible mapping in any homotopy class
of self-mappings.that is the non-slip boundary conditions must be violated61,62
in order for the pseudo-anosov phase to become possible.(this is in complete
agreement with thurstons earthquakesmentioned in part i).

corollary 36 6.5.c)the deformations of r may take place in real time .the
evolution of such surface is described by the product r  [0, t] which is just
some 3-manifold (see next subsection).this type of manifold was suggested by
witten in connection with 2+1 gravity53 (without matter elds).inclusion of the
matter elds produces the pseudo-anosov foliations evolving in real time.this
can be most conveniently explained in terms of braids through connection with
the meandritic labyrinths discussed in part i.we provide some details related to
this connection in section 7.5.in addition,we would like to describe briey the
emerging connections with 3-manifolds .this is accomplished in the remainder
of this paper and in the appendix.

6.4 6.4. 2+1 gravity and hyperbolic 3-manifolds

in this subsection and in the appendix,without any pretense on completeness,we
would like to mention several facts related to 3-manifolds.more detailed analysis
would require a separate publication(s) and is left for the future .

there are several ways to construct 3-manifolds.for the comprehensive treat-
ment of this subject,e.g. see refs.63,64.a quick introduction into this eld is
beautifully presented in refs.36 and 65.in particular,following ref.65, we would
like to describe one of the methods of constructing 3-manifolds which is natu-
rally connected with the results of the preceding subsection.

let s be a compact surface (2 manifold) ,perhaps,with boundary.let i=[0,1]
be the closed interval of real numbers from 0 to 1.then,the cartesian product
s  i is 3-manifold with boundary.consider now the bottom,i.e.s  {0}, and
the top,i.e.s  {1}, surfaces and let us glue them together.the operation of
gluing is trivial if the top surface is the same as the bottom surface(that is if
the bottom surface was parallel translated to the top).but,the situation becomes
more intresting if one considers the surface homeomorphisms h : s  s.these
homeomorphisms are superimposed with the gluing operation in which each
point (x, 0)  s {0} of the bottom surface is identied with the corresponding
point (f (x), 1)  s  {1} of the top surface.the result of such an identication
is new 3-manifold which is actually a ber bundle over the circle s1 (compare
this discussion with that of section 3,part i )each of the bers being the original
surface at given instant of time.the fact that thus constructed manifold is
a ber bundle is in accord with the discussion presented in thurstons book
(ref.36,page 159) where some additional details could be found.

although we just had explained the construction of a typical 3-manifold,it is
still unclear from this construction why this manifold has to be hyperbolic and
why 2+1 gravity should be related to the hyperbolic 3-manifolds(as well as to

33

knots and links).the connection between 3-manifolds and knots and links was
established by lickorish 66and wallace 67 who proved the following

theorem 37 6.6.every closed ,connected ,orientable 3-manifold is obtained
from s3 by removing mutually exclusive (but ,perhaps,knotted and linked)collection
of solid(framed) tori {ti} ,i=1-n,and then sewing them back into s3 in a dif-
ferent way.(cid:3)

from the theorem 6.6.

it is not immediately clear how 3-manifolds con-
structed with help of the ber bundle methods are related to that constructed
by dehn surgery methods used in the theorem by lickorish and wallace.leaving
the answer to this question aside,e.g.see ref.64 for more details,we arrive at the
following

corollary 38 6.6.every closed ,connected,orientable 3-manifold is a comple-
ment of some knot or link.

having this corollary, the question arises:under what conditions the dy-
namics of 2+1 gravity and /or dynamics of liquid crystals can be associated
with knots/links or,alternatively ,with 3-manifolds (obtained with help of dehn
surgery or ber bundle methods)?

in 1970 geroch68 had proven the following

theorem 39 6.7.if the open set n is globaly hyperbolic,then if it is considered

as a manifold,it is homeomorphic top(3) r wherep(3) is some 3-dimensional

a  r the productp(3) {a}is the cauchy surface .(cid:3)

manifold and

remark 40 6.2.for the precise denition of the cauchy surface,please,consult
ref.69.

remark 41 6.3.theorem 6.7. admits natural extension to the case of 2+1

face of some nite genus.this is in complete accord with the results of witten53.

gravity.in this case,we have to replacep(3) withp(2) which is the riemann sur-
the productsp(2) r had been recently discussed in ref.70 (and references

therein).in ref.70 no attempts were made towards physical applications .below
,and ,in part,in the appendix we shall provide some condensed summary of the
results mainly associated with ref.70,which could be associated with dynamics
of 2+1 gravity.

let us return to the theorem 6.7 in order to explain the meaning of the
words globally hyperbolic.from part i we know already about the hyperbolic
poincare disc d2 and the hyperbolic half plane h-model(section 4).these results
can be easily extended.for example,the hyperbolic h 3 model can be dened by
analogy with eq.(4.1) (part i):

34

h 3 = {(x, y, t)  r3, z = x + iy = c,t > 0}

(6.17)

and,instead of the open disc d2 model dened by eq.(4.2),now we have to
consider an open ball b3with sphere s2
 at
innity for d2. instead of the fuchsian groups sl(2,r)/{  i}, we need to use
now the quasi-fuchsian (or kleinian) groups  generated by sl(2,c)/{  i} .
denition 42 6.3. a hyperbolic 3-manifold m is a quotient m = h 3/ of
the hyperbolic h 3 space by the kleinian group  .

 at innity replacing the circle s1

theorem 43 6.8.let h : s  s be the pseudo-anosov homeomorphism.then,the
3-manifold obtained by bering over the circle s1 is hyperbolic and has nite(
hyperbolic) volume.

proof. please,consult ref.70.(cid:3)

corollary 44 6.8.a)since the volume of such designed 3-manifold is nite,it
is associated with knots(links).that is such manifold is a complement(in s3) of
some knot or link(theorem 6.6).

proof. please,consult ref.36.(cid:3)

corollary 45 6.8.b)if we take the hyperbolic 3-manifold that bers over the
circle, with ber being a 2d surface ,and unwrap the covering space by unwrap-
ping the circle direction,then the volume of thus obtained manifold is innite.

proof. please,consult ref.36 (page 258).(cid:3)

remark 46 6.4.the result just presented is in complete accord with the con-
clusion made in ref.69(e.g.see paragraph 6.4).that is , the physical space-time
is noncompact and is a universal covering space of the space-time which is
compact.to prove the existence of such compactied space is highly nontriv-
ial.accordingly, the existence of knots and links in 2+1 gravity is not selfobvi-
ous.

remark 47 6.5.theorem 6.8. is in complete accord with the theorem 6.5.dis-
cussed earlier.that is ,the surface motion which is associated with stretching
,which takes place in real time ,creates the hyperbolic 3-manifolds ( provided
that the issue of compactication is resolved).

remark 48 6.6.the previous remark allows us to provide ,yet another,interpretation
of the process of compactication through the notion of the universal teichmuller
curve which was introduced by bers71 and was discussed in physical literature
in connection with problems related to string theories 72.this and other topics
related to compactication are summarized in the appendix.

7 discussion

7.1 7.1. quantization of 2+1 gravity

the results presented in parts i and ii provide mainly classical description
of 2+1 gravity.the quantum description may require computations which are
based on the master equation,eq.(4.13) ,of part i. that is one has to consider
some sort of the random walk on the mapping class group of some 2 dimen-
sional surface of genus g > 1,possibly with punctures.to make these computa-
tions meaningful it is essential to nd physically unambiguous way by which
the transition amplitudes wij in eq.(4.13) of part i can be calculated.to this
purpose,we anticipate ,that the physical results obtained by t hooft ,e.g.see
refs.73-76, and their development by franzosi and guadagnini77 could be very
helpful. in addition,the results of appendix suggest that the quantization could
be achieved as well by methods of non commutative geometry applied directly to
the teichmuller space(more correctly,to the bers slice).according to ref.78,the
qiuasiconformal charts provide enough analysis to quantize the manifold in
the sense of constructing a hilbert space and relevant operator replacing cur-
vature... the involved hilbert space theoretical data are of the same nature as
those appearing in the transfer matrix theory of statistical mechanics and sug-
gest a purely combinatorial approach...in the extended context of spaces with
singularities. in the physical language ,the transfer matrix approach discussed
in ref.78 can be easily recognized as feynman-wiener-kac -type of path integral
calculations.

7.2 7.2.connections with the theory of dislocations and

disclinations

connections between 2+1 gravity and the theory of defects and textures in solids
was recently discussed by katanaev and volovich,ref.15 (part i).these authors
had noticed that the theory of wedge and edge dislocations as well as the linear
disclinations in solids is isomorphic
to the theory of 2+1 gravity of deser,
jackiw and t hooft. using arguments which are completely dierent from
those presented in sections 4-6 of part ii ,katanaev and volovich nevertheless
had arrived at correct mass (hopf) quantization condition,denition 4.1..they
missed ,however,the sum rules of our section 6 which could be obtained only
with help of the theory of quadratic dierentials.

7.3 7.3.connections with the theory of motions in classical

and quantum billiards

the problem of quantization of 2+1 gravity (as well as motion of point-like
defects in the presence of wedge and edge dislocations,etc) could be considered
also from the point of view of classical and quantum motion of particles in
the billiards.the connection between the quadratic dierentials and billiards is

36

known to matematicians for some time.in this regard reading of the encyclo-
pedic references,refs79-81,is most helpful.reading of the related literature,e.g.
refs 61 and 82 as well as ref.83 ,may be helpful as well.since in the mathemat-
ical physics literature currently there is a strong interest in the detailed study
of various mesoscopic systems84, we anticipate that some cross fertilization
between dierent domains of the same discipline (physics) could produce some
unexpected results.

7.4 7.4.crumpling,fracture,brittleness

in his wonderful book , ref.36,thurston discusses the construction of what he
calls a hyperbolic paper . this construction is based on the famous theorem
by hilbert

theorem 49 7.1.there is no complete smooth surface embedded in euclidean
three-space with the local intrinsic geometry of pseudosphere (e.g.see the beak
of the bird  in fig.6)

that is when the surface crumples,it necessarily develops the conical-like
beaks.the mathematics of this crumpling process is discussed in thurstons
famous lecture notes (e.g.see ref.20 ,part i)and,surely,involves the train tracks.at
the same time,in physics literature the process of crumpling of surfaces was re-
cently discussed in refs.85,86.the process of crumpling is closely related to
brittleness and fracture.depending upon the rigidity of surface,it may or may
not want to crumple under the applied stresses.in the last case case,we may
observe some cracks(more exactly,the crack patterns,e.g.see ref.87, which even-
tually cause the disintegration of the surface.the dynamical equations for such
crack patterns are similar to the master equation,eq.(4.13),part i,for 2+1 grav-
ity.evidently,one can get some additional insights into both elds if one is aware
about the existence of the other.since microscopically the cracks are caused by
dislocations/disclinations,e.g.see section 7.2.,surely,one can think about the dy-
namics of 2+1 gravity in terms of the dynamics and topology88 of fracture 89
.

7.5 7.5.meanders,the temperley-lieb algebra and the in-

variants of 3-manifolds

in part i,section 5,fig.25,we have mentioned that any meander (or disconnected
system of meanders)can be built by superposition of two arc congurations of the
same order: one is being considered as the top while another as the bottom.in
ref.36,part i,it is shown,that both the top and the bottom congurations can
be obtained with help of the product of the temperley-lieb (tl) algebra gen-
erators(since these generators admit braid-like graphical representation) {ei}
which obey the tl algebra tln() given by :

eiej = ejei

if |i-j| > 1

37

e2
i = ei

,

i = 1, ..., m  1

eiei1ei =ei , i = 1, ..., m  1

where  is some constant.for the tl algebra composed of n elements,1,e1, ..., en1
,the number of possible independent products of ei generators is given by the
catalan number,eq.(3.9),part i. following lickorish90,91 ,one can think of the
space of these independent products as a vector space vn of dimension cn
.then,one can construct a bilinear form

< , > : vn  vn

which in ordinary language means just a kind of a pairing between the top
and the bottom arc congurations as discussed above.as it was shown by lick-
orish,the above bilinear form plays the central role in constructing the alge-
braic invariants of 3-manifolds.hence,use of the meanders allows to provide
the alternative (to the chern-simons92) formulation of the invariants of 3-
manifolds.additional connections between the tl algebra and the meanders
could be found based on the notion of parenthesis92.the parenthesis are also
associated with tl algebra.by denition,a parenthesis diagram is a word in the
alphabet with three letters  ( and ) , e.g.see page 543 of ref.91.exactly the
same three letter alphabet is used for the description of meanders,e.g.see page
121 of ref.34 (part i).we hope,that these connections deserve further study.

note added in proof. after this work was completed ,we run across the only

one article by einstein written for the scientic american (sci.am.182(4),pages
13-17 (1950))in which he wrote ,e.g. see page 16 (bottom),the fact that
the masses appear as singularities indicates that these masses themselves
cannot be explained by symmetrical gik elds,or gravitational elds.not
even the fact that only positive gravitating masses exist can be deduced
from the theory.evidently a complete relativistic eld theory must be
based on a eld of more complex nature....in the above, the word posi-
tive was emphasized by einstein himself. we were mystied by the fact
that the theory of quadratic dierentials had begun its development just
about the time when einstein wrote these words.

appendix

in this appendix we would like to provide an outline of the results recently
obtained in mathematical literature which are related to the problem of com-
pactication discussed in section 6.4.the purpose of such presentation also lies
in demonstration of nontriviality of the problem of knots/links relevance to 2+1
gravity.

let us begin with the following observations.the group of mobius transfor-
mations  with real coecients ,psl(2,r), is dened through the transforma-
tion law

(z) =

az + b
cz + d

,

ad  bc = 1.

(a.1)

the discontinuous subgroups (e.g.see denition a.4. below) of  are called
fuchsian groups.these subgroups are classied as elliptic (respectively ,parabolic
and hyperbolic ) if |a + d| < 2 (respectively, |a + d| = 2 or |a + d| > 2 ).com-
pare with appendix to part i.
a parabolic transformation is conjugate in  to the translation: z  z + 1,
a hyperbolic transformation is conjugate to :z  z for some  > 1. let g  
and let  : h  h/g be some riemann surface,then one can prove the following
theorem 50 a.1. if h/g is compact ,then each   g\{id} is hyperbolic

proof. please,consult ref.29.(cid:3)

these results can be generalized to higher dimensions.e.g.instead of h we

can use h 3 dened by eq.(6.17),instead of psl(2,r) we have to use psl(2,c).theorem
is extendable to h 3 and is most useful if instead of h 3 model we would
a.1.
use the poincare sphere model.that is instead of an open disc d2 model with
 being a circle at innity,we would use an open ball b3 model with s2
s1

being a sphere at innity.the hyperbolic transformations in d2 have xed
points on s1
.
the hyperbolic polygon in h (or d2) is being replaced now with the hyperbolic
polyhedron in h 3 or b3.

 .the hyperbolic transformations in b3 have xed points on s2

denition 51 a.1.a fuchsian group  is nitely generated if the corre-
sponding hyperbolic polygon in h (or d2) has nite hyperbolic area.

denition 52 a.2.a quasi-fuchsian (kleinian) group is geometrically -
nite if the corresponding hyperbolic polyhedron in h 3(or b3) has nitely many
faces.

remark 53 a.1.all known knots /links (except torus and satellite) have as
their complements the hyperbolic manifolds associated with the geometrically
nite kleinian groups36.

40

let g   be some element of geometrically nite kleinian group.consider
the hyperbolic distance dg(x) = d(x, g(x)). thurston36 had proven the follow-
ing

theorem 54 a.2. g is hyperbolic if and only if the inmum of dg is pos-
itive.this inmum is attained along the line,which is unique axis for g .the
endpoints of the axis are the xed points of g on s2

(cid:3)

.

corollary 55 a.2.if x  h 3( or b3),the limit set lg  s2
 is the set of
accumulation points of the orbit gx of x. lg is independent of the choice
of x.

denition 56 a.3.the domain of discontinuity d for a discrete group  is
given by d = s2
\l. a discrete subgroup of psl(2,c) acting on d whose
domain of discontinuity is non-empty is called kleinian group.

denition 57 a.4.a group  acting on a locally compact space x is called
properly discontinuous if for every compact set kx there are only nitely
many    such that kk6= .

denition 58 a.5.the kleinian manifold m is dened by

m =(cid:0)h 3  d(cid:1) / .

let s be compact oriented surface of negative euler characteristic.let s
denote the boundary of s and ints = s\s be the interior of s .analogously,for
3-manifolds we have

denition 59 a.6.the boundary of m is given by  m = d/ .

corollary 60 a.3.some kleinian manifolds are bounded by a pair of riemann
surfaces x(bottom) and y(top) .there is a homeomorphism between m and
ints  [0, 1] which is compatible with marking of x by s and y by s (where s
is the same surface as s but

with reversed orientation).

proof. please,consult refs.70,71 and 94.(cid:3)

remark 61 a.2.the marking of riemann surface x should be understood in
the following sense. the teichmuller space t eich(s) classies the conformal
structures on ints in which each boundary component corresponds to a punc-
ture.a point in t eich(s) is specied by x which is conformaly equivalent to a
punctured disc d2(surely ,in general,with more than one puncture).a homeo-
morphism f : ints x which sends the orientation on s to the (canonical)
orientation on x is called marking of x.

41

the corollary a.3.

leads us to the most important generalization due to

bers,ref.71.it can be formulated in the form of the following

theorem 62 a.3.given two (in general,dierent)riemann surfaces x and y
of genus g and an orientation reversing map j between them,there is a uniquely
determined (up to normalization)quasi-fuchsian group g for which the bottom
surface is (conformaly equivalent to)x,the top ,to y,and the associated involu-
tion xy is homotopic to j.

denition 63 a.7.consider the set of all quasi-fuchsian groups whose bot-
tom surface x is xed .this set is called the bers slice by based on x
.the points in the teichmuller space are represented by the top surfaces and
their relation (via involution) to the xed bottom surface x.

corollary 64 a.4.the motion through the bers slice is associated with the
motion through various hyperbolic 3-manifolds whose bottom boundary compo-
nent is xed but whose top varies. the slice may have an edge associated with
the fact that the top component may eventually degenerate in some way.

remark 65 a.3.a)the motion through the bers slice is directly connected with
the motion due to the pseudo-anosov surface homeomorphisms(theorem6.8);a.3.b)the
degeneration of the bers slice is associated with the boundary of the teichmuller
space and formation of all kinds of spikes(cusps) on the top surface.

denition 66 a.8.3-manifold is simply degenerate if it is topologically equiv-
alent (homeomorphic )to the product s  r where s is the compact riemann
surface of negative euler characteristic74.

denition 67 a.9.3-manifold is called geometrically tame if all of its ends
are either geometrically nite(denition a.2) or simply degenerate (denition
a.8)..

denition 68 a.10.the thick-thin decomposition of a hyperbolic manifold m
,ref.36, can be best understood by analyzing fig.6.the thin part of m is made
of neigbourhoods of short geodesics and cusps isomorphic to pseudospheres

fig.6.

theorem 69 a.4.the complete hyperbolic manifold m has the nite hyper-
bolic volume if and only if the thick part ,m ,is compact for all  > 0.

proof. please,consult ref.36.(cid:3)

remark 70 a.4.this theorem is central for the whole chain of arguments
which provide justication of knots/links existence in 2+1 gravity.indeed,guided
by this theorem,it is possible now to prove the following

42

theorem 71 a.5.let m = h 3/ be innite volume topologically tame hyper-
bolic 3-manifold.then,if  is nitely generated subgroup of  ,either

a) m = h 3/ is geometrically nite,or
b) the thin part m has a geometrically innite end e such that the local
isometry p : m  m is nite one-to-one on some neigbourhood u of e.
proof. please,consult ref.96 and take into account fig.6 and theorem

a.4.(cid:3)

remark 72 a.5 although the theorema.5. provides the desired result ,it does
not contain the constructive prescription as to how to obtain m (that is how
to nd  and to construct the quotient).the most spectacular results of ref.70
address just this problem.they are the following:

a) the manifold m is homeomorphic to the hyperbolic 3-manifold which

ber

over the circle;

b) the motion through the bers slice which produces m is characterized

by the functional equation ( similar to the feigenbaum-cvitanovich
equation for the chaotic maps97) which possesses the xed point
controlling the existence of m .

remark 73 a.6.in view of the feigenbaum-cvitanovich universal equation for
maps of the interval ,it is reasonable to expect some sort of universality in the
knot /link structures (types) for 2+1 gravity.this topic deserves much more
study.
