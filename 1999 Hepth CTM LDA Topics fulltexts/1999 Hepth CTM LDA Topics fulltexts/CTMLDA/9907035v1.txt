abstract

a systematic numerical study of the classical solutions to the combined system consisting
of the georgi-glashow model and the so(3) gauged skyrme model is presented. the
gauging of the skyrme system permits a lower bound on the energy, so that the solutions
of the composite system can be topologically stable. the solutions feature some very
interesting bifurcation patterns, and it is found that some branches of these solutions are
unstable.

1 introduction

the physical motivation of the present work is to set the framework for a semiclassical ap-
proach to describing the mechanism of monopole catalysis of baryon number decay, proposed
by rubakov [1] and callan [2]. here we are led by the work of callan and witten [3], where
the baryon is described as the soliton of the skyrme [4] model, in the backgroud of the u(1)
maxwell eld of a monopole in the dirac gauge. in the present work, the baryon is again de-
scribed by a skyrmion, which in this case interacts with the full so(3) non-abelian higgs model
(the georgi-glashow model) so that the skyrmion we consider is gauged with the full so(3)
group and interacts with the t hooft-polyakov monopole [5]. we will refer to this model as
monopole-skyrmion model (msm).

the most important dierence between the present work and that of ref. [3] is that here we
have two distinct topological charges - the rst being the baryon number of the skyrmion and
the second, the monopole charge. the energy of our composite system therefore has a topological
lower bound consisting of a combination of these two charges of rather dierent geometric natures,
the baryon charge being a degree which cannot be expressed as a total divergence while the
monople charge is a ux by virtue of being descended from the second chern-pontryagin class.
the most important feature of describing the interaction of the skyrmion with the gauge
eld in our monopole-skyrmion model is the presrciption of gauging the skyrme eld with the
diagonal su(2). this prescription was introduced in ref. [6] for the gauged skyrme model,
where no higgs eld and higgs potential are present, and the resulting solutions were studied in
ref. [7, 8]. most importantly, this gauging permits a lower bound on the energy of the gauged
skyrmion unlike in the case when the usual gauging is from the left, e.g.
in ref. [11] where
there is no lower bound. in this paper, we shall refer to the models arising from the gauging
prescription used in [6] as gauged skyrme models (gsm). since the topological lower bounds for
the gsms were presented in detail in refs. [6, 7], and because all that we need to know here is
that these exist, we do not discuss them further here.

now the presence of a topological lower bound is not a sucient condition for the existence of
a topologically stable soliton. to illustrate this we refer to the graph of the energy versus skyrme
coupling constant in fig. 1 for the gsm studied in [7, 8]. without being mathematically rigorous
one can suppose that the branches ags and bgs correspond to solutions, which form local minima
of the energy functional, whereas the connecting branch ags correspond to solutions, which form
sattlepoints.

the bifurcation structure in fig. 1 is quite dierent from that appearing in models where the
skyrme eld is gauged as in [11] without a topological lower bound. the corresponding graph to
fig. 1 in that case is given in the work of ref. [12] featuring only two branches as opposed to the
three in fig. 1. of these two branches [12] only one corresponds to stable solutions, as expected
from the work of refs. [13]. thus a buttery pattern of bifurcations with two stable branches
seems to be typical of of gsms with topological lower bounds. we will nd in our study of the
monopole-skyrme model, that the buttery of fig. 1 persits for some range of the parameters
in the model.

having already presented the lower bound on the energy of monopole-skyrme model in
ref. [8], we do not repeat it here and proceed straight away to the study the solutions numerically,

with a view to exposing some of their qualitative features that may be of some physical interest.
the model we employ here is a slightly modied version of the one in ref. [8].
it features a
particular interaction term between the higgs eld and the chiral eld in such a way that it also
xes the asymptotic values of the chiral eld subject to the nite energy condition, and assuring
integral baryon number. in section 2 we present the model, discuss its spectrum, and discuss
some some scaling properties which will become pivotal in the subsequent numerical analysis. in
section 3, we subject the system to spherical symmetry and give the classical equations to be
integrated, the detailed numerical results of which we give in section 4. in section 5 we analyse
the normal modes of the radial uctuations around the solutions to the msm, characterised by
those values of the parameters for which the solutions display buttery bifurcations, and verify
that indeed the branches corresponding to ags are unstable. a summary and discussions of our
results are given in section 6.

f = a  a + i [a, a] ,

and the covariant derivatives for the higgs eld  = aa and the chiral matrix u = exp{iaa}
are dened as

d =  + i [a, ] ,

respectively. g denotes the gauge coupling parameter,  the strength of the higgs potential, 
the norm of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs eld, f the pion decay constant and 
the skyrme coupling parameter. the parameter g characterises the direct coupling between
the higgs boson and the chiral matrix.

the rst three terms in (1) are the familiar georgi-glashow model which is characterised by
the scale . the next two terms are the skyrme model with covariant derivatives du allowing
for an interaction of the chiral matrix with the gauge potential. the rst of these terms introduces
another scale, f. the last term v (, u) describes a direct coupling of the chiral matrix with
the higgs eld, on which we will comment later.

the lagrangian (1) is invariant under local su(2) gauge transformations g,

a  gag1 + igg1 ,
  gg1 ,
u  gu g1 .

the vacuum of the theory is given by the following constant conguration,

a  0 ,   3 , u  1 .

in order to identify the particle content of the model we expand around the vacuum,

a = aa

and insert into the equation of motion obtained from the lagrangian (1). neglecting quadratic
terms in aa

, a and a we nd

a = g2
3 = 423 ,
a,3 = 0 ,
a,a = g22a,a , a = 1, 2 ,

ba3b, and used the gauge xing conditions a,3 = 0
where we have dened aa
and a,a = 0 for a = 1, 2. thus we nd for the masses of the gauge eld, the chiral eld and
the higgs eld,

 = aa

 +

1


ma = g , m = g , mh = 2q ,

(8)
respectively. (we take all parameters g, g, ,  to be positive). clearly, the mass of the chiral
eld stems form the interaction term of the chiral matrix with the higgs eld, which breaks the
chiral symmetry. however, the spontaneous symmetry breaking does not lead to a mass splitting
for the chiral elds.

in the following we will motivate the potential term (2) for the higgs eld and the chiral
matrix. first consider the model without the potential term. from the nite energy conditions
we nd for the chiral eld and the higgs eld in the limit r  

d  0 , du  0 .

(9)

let us assume, that this condition is fullled for the radial component of the covariant derivatives
and concentrate on the angular components. we decompose the higgs eld and the chiral matrix
in the form

 =

 = aa , with a a = 1 ,
u = cosf 1 + i sinf u , u = uaa , with ua ua = 1 ,

h  ,

(10)

respectively, where h, a and f, ua are functions of the variables r, , .

from the nite energy conditions follows that at innity |h| = , f = const. however, a

and ua may still be functions of the angular variables , . the conditions (9) now become

d = (

(11)

 + i[a, ])(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= 0 , du = sinf ( u + i[a, u])| = 0 ,

where  = , . the rst condition can be fullled with a| = (cid:16) i

fullled, f may take arbitrary values. hence, these congurations can be deformed continuously
into congurations with trivial chiral matrix.

in order to avoid this problem we have introduced the potential (2) into the lagrangian.

using the general decomposition (10) the potential can be written as v (, u) = 1

i. e. it couples the modulus of the higgs eld |h| and the chiral function f , and does not depend
on the phases a, ua. consequently, the masses for the chiral elds, introduced by the potential
at innity, do not depend on the direction of the higgs eld in isospace. furthermore, the nite
energy condition now forces f = n, where n is an integer.

the sum of the potentials in (1) has global minima at |h| = , f = n, and the matrix
of the second variations has only non-negative eigenvalues at the global minima, provided the
parameters  and g2

 are positive.

in order to study the consequences of the two scales f and  we will take two points of view.
first we will x f and express all dimensionful quantities in units of f. equivalently, we can
x  and express all dimensionful quantities in units of . in each case, the ratio of the scales
will enter the equations of motion as a parameter.

we dene the dimensionless quantities x = rfg ,

in terms of masses eq. (8) the
parameters g and  can be expressed as g = m/ma and  = 2mh/ma, respectively. the
parameter 0 = f/ denotes the ratio of the scales. apart form the last term the hamiltonian
(12) this is equivalent to the hamiltonian studied before in [8]. the dierence is, that we now
consider 0 as a free parameter. in the limit 0  0 the minimum of the higgs potential allows
for a vanishing higgs eld. in this case we nd the gauged skyrme model considered before in
[6, 7, 8].

fixing the scale parameter  we dene x = gr,  =  and  = f/. then the hamiltonian

comparing with the case of xed scale f we nd  = 1/0, x = 0x,  = /0. because the
hamiltonians (12) and (13) are equivalent, we can obtain the properties of (12) from (13) and

vice versa by using these relations. in particular, for the dimensionless energies e

r = sin (cos 1 + sin 2) + cos 3 ,

 =  sin 1 + cos 2 .
the spherically symmetric ansatz for the higgs eld is

and for the chiral matrix

 = h(x)r ,

u = cosf (x) + i sinf (x)r .

the ansatz is form invariant under the u(1) gauge transformations [9]

b(x)  cos (x)b(x)  sin (x)a(x) ,
a(x)  cos (x)a(x) + sin (x)b(x) ,

(18)

whereas the higgs eld function h(x) and the chiral function f (x) are invariant. to x this gauge
freedom we rst impose the condition c(x)  0, which still allows for global transformations with
 = const. further, we nd that the functions a(x) and b(x) enter the lagrangian only in the
form a2(x) + b2(x) and a2(x) + b2(x), which permits us to set b(x)  0.

4 numerical results

we have constructed numerically solutions of the model for several values of the parameters 0,
,  and g. in particular we investigated the dependence of the solutions on the parameters
0 and .

in figs. 2a and 2b we show the energy e =

g
4fh as a function of 0 for several values of 
for  = 0 and g = 0. for large values of 0 the energy is a monotonically increasing function
of 0. in the limit 0   the energy increases linearly with 0, such that e/0  1, i. e. the
energy becomes equal to the monopole energy (in units of 4). indeed, this limit corresponds
to the limit f  0 where the chiral eld becomes trivial, u = 1 everywhere except at innity.

4.1   f
for small values of 0 the solutions develop bifurcations, corresponding to the buttery struc-
tures in fig. 2a, where for a xed value of 0 three solutions coexist. we observe form fig. 2a
that the bifurcations occur only for a nite range of the parameter , (1)
cr , where
(1)
cr , (2)
cr  0.4495. we
demonstrate the details of the bifurcations in fig. 2b for  = 0.4 as an example. this gure
suggests that the branches b and a correspond to local minima of the energy functional, whereas
the branch a corresponds to saddlepoint solutions.

cr depend on  and g. for  = 0, g = 0 we nd (1)

cr  0.374 and (2)

cr <  < (2)

the bifurcation pattern looks similar to the bifurcation pattern found recently in the gauged
skyrme model [8].
indeed, the bifurcations in the monopole-skyrme model and the gauged
skyrme model are closely related to each other. in the limit 0  0 the higgs potential allows
for a vanishing higgs eld. in this case we obtain the gauged skyrmion model studied in refs. [6,

7, 8]. consequently, the monopole-skyrmion solutions should approach the gauged skyrmion
solution in the limit of vanishing 0. in fig. 3 we show in a 3d graph the energy of the monopole-
skyrmion solutions as a function of 0 and  together with the energy of the gauged skyrmion
solutions. we observe, that indeed the energy of the monopole-skyrmion coincides with the
energy of the gauged skyrmion in the limit 0  0.
in order to understand the behaviour of the solutions for small 0, let us rst discuss the
solutions of the higgs-less gauged-skyrme model. in this model the absence of the higgs eld
allows two possibilities for the value of the gauge eld function a(x) at innity. for large values
of  the function a(x) vanishes at innity (branch bgs) whereas for small values of  the function
a(r) approaches the value one at innity (branches ags and ags). these two cases correspond
to the dashed and solid lines, respectively, plotted in the e   plane in fig. 3. for a certain
range of values cr
a three branches of solutions are present, reminding one of two local
minima (bgs and ags) and a saddlepoint ( ags) of the energy functional.

now consider the limit 0  0 for the monopole-skyrmion solutions. if  < cr

b the monopole-
skyrmion solution will approach the unique gauged skyrmion solution represented by the solid
line in fig. 3, below cr
a there are three dierent gauged skyrmion
solutions available. in this case each monopole-skyrmion solutions of the branches a, a and
b approaches the corresponding gauged skyrmion solution on the branches ags, ags and bgs,

the limit 0  0 is non-uniform for  < cr

a for the monopole-skyrmion solutions on the

a(x) for the monopole-skyrmion solutions and the gauged-skyrmion solutions (branches ags and
ags) are dierent. for the latter the function a(x) approaches the value one at innity, whereas
for the former ones a(x) vanishes at innity. to illustrate the limit 0  0 for small values of

solutions along the buttery for  = 0.4 in figs. 2a and 2b. we follow the branch b down to

figure 4:
(a) the gauge eld function a(x) is shown for several values of 0 for xed  = 0.4,
 = 0 and g = 0. (b) the same as fig. 4a for the scaled higgs eld function h(x)/0. (c)
the same as fig. 4a for the chiral function f (x). the dierent lines correspond to 0 = 1(b),
0 = 0.03(b), 0 = 0.03( a) , 0 = 0.03(a) and 0 = 0.0001(a) from top to bottom.

in fig. 4a the prole of the gauge eld function a(x) is shown for 0 = 1.0 and 0 = 0.03 on
branch b, for 0 = 0.03 on branch a, and, for 0 = 0.03 and 0 = 0.0001 on branch a. while
for 0 = 1.0, 0 = 0.03 (b), and 0 = 0.03 ( a), a(x) is a monotonically decreasing function of
x, it develops a local maximum at some stage on the branch a while 0 increases. passing to
the branch a, now with decreasing 0, this local maximum persists. along this path the local
maximum a(xmax) and its location xmax increase and reach a(xmax = ) = 1 as 0 tends to zero,

11

while the asymptotic region, where a(x) decays to zero, is shifted to innity. thus, in the limit
0  0 the gauge eld function of the monopole-skyrmion solution tends to the corresponding
function of the gauged skyrmion solution for all x except at innity. therefore the convergence
of the monopole-skyrmion on a and a to the gauged-skyrmion solutions on ags and ags is
non-uniform.

in fig. 4b we exhibit the proles of the scaled higgs function h(x)/0 for the same parameters
0 like in fig. 4a. we observe that h(x)/0 is a monotonically increasing function of x for all
0. however along the path of values of 0 described above, the magnitudes of the functions
h(x)/0 become progressively smaller on an increasing interval, while the asymptotic region,
where h(x) approaches its vacuum value 0, is shifted to increasing values of x.
in the limit
0  0 the function h(x) vanishes everywhere, signaling the merging of the monopole-skyrmions
to the (higgs-free) gauged-skyrmions in this limit.
in fig. 4c we show the proles of the chiral function f (x) for the same values of parameters
0 as in figs. 4a,b. for all values of 0 the function f (x) in a monotonically decreasing function
of x. in contrast to the gauge eld function a(x) and the higgs eld function h(x) the chiral
function f (x) does not change considerably with 0.

b <  < cr

the case discussed above in figs. 4a,b,c pertains to  < cr

a there are
gauged-skyrmion solutions of both types, namely those on branches ags and ags as well as on
branch bgs, so the convergence of the monopole-skyrmion solutions to the gauged-skyrmion
solutions can be both uniform and non-uniform . in that case the monopole-skyrmion solutions
on the branches a and a approach the gauged-skyrmion solutions on the corresponding branches
ags and ags in a non-uniform way, for the same reasons as described above. however, the gauge
eld function of the monopole-skyrmion solutions of the branch b obey the same asymptotic
behaviour as the corresponding function of the gauged skyrmion solutions of the branch bgs.
for these solutions the convergence is uniform.

for  > cr

a , there is only one type of gauged-skyrmion solution, namely those on branch
bgs for which the asymptotic value of the gauge eld function a(x) equals zero like for the
monopole-skyrmion solution, and hence the convergence of these solutions as 0  0 is uniform.

4.2   f
let us now consider the case where the scale  is much larger than the scale f. in fig. 5 we show
the eld congurations for 0 = 2700 (solid lines) and for 0 = 1 (dashed lines) for comparison.
we observe that the gauge eld function a(x) for 0 = 2700 approaches its asymptotic value at a
very small distance from the origin. the same applies to the scaled higgs eld function h(x)/0,
except for the long ranged tail, which is due to the power law decay for vanishing higgs mass,
i. e. for  = 0. the chiral function f (x), however, extends to larger distances from the origin.
this is in contrast to the conguration for 0 = 1, where the change in the prole of all functions
is roughly on the same interval.

note, that 0 = 2700 corresponds to the case where the parameters f and  are of the
magnitude of the pion decay constant in low energy qcd and the vacuum expectation value of
the higgs eld in the weinberg-salam model, respectively. for the energy of this solution we
nd 4e = 2700.013 4, i. e. roughly the energy of the bps monopole (4). an appealing

physical interpretation of this solution seems to be that a monopole resides at the center of a
baryon and dominates its mass.

this can also be seen in a dierent way using gauge invariant quantities like topological

charges. we dene the topological monopole charge density as

m p =

t r {fijdk} ijk ,

and according to ref. [6, 7] the gauge invariant baryonic charge density as

respective maxima. the values of the normalization constants are (4x2 m p )max = 2.113 and

and b(x)/max(b) (dashed lines) are shown for 0 = 2700 and 0 = 0.0001 for xed  = 0.4,

(4x2 b)max = 11080 for 0 = 0.0001, and (4x2 m p )max = 0.31 and (4x2 b)max = 0.113 for
0 = 2700, respectively.

from fig. 6 we observe that for 0 = 2700 the location xmp

max of the maximum of the function
m p resides at a considerably smaller distance from the origin than the the location xb
max of the
maximum of the function b. this conrms the interpretation as a monopole inside a baryon.
note, that the function b possesses an additional local maximum at a larger distance from the
origin than the global maximum and a minimum with vanishing magnitude between the both
maxima. we found that half the baryonic charge stems from the area below the rst peak and
half from the area below the second peak. this can be understood as follows. for distances larger
than or near the location of the minimum xmin the gauge eld function a(x) almost vanishes.
setting a(x) = 0 in b we nd that the minimum corresponds to f (xmin) = /2. splitting the

14

integral of the baryonic charge density into two parts,

b = z xmin

0

bdx +z

(26)

we nd for both parts the value 1/2.

let us next discuss the charge densities for 0 = 0.0001. in this case we observe from fig. 6
that the peaks of m p and b are roughly at the same location. however, at a large distance
from these peaks the function m p possesses a second local maximum. we found, that the
magnetic charge stems mainly from this second local maximum, whereas the contribution from
the global maximum is marginal. this behaviour becomes plausible if we consider the prole
of the gauge eld function a(x) in fig. 4a. for small values of x the function a(x) is close to
one. consequently, the magnetic charge density is small. for larger values of x the function
a(x) develops a local minimum, this leads to the rst peak of m p . when a(x) approaches
again the value one, the function m p again becomes very small. at large distances the function
a(x) decays to its asymptotic value. this leads to the second maximum of m p . however, the
magnetic charge density also depends on the higgs eld function h(x), and one would expect
that the charge density has to be small if h(x) is small, i. e. in the region where the gauge eld
function possesses its local minimum, see figs. 4a and 4b. this is indeed the case. note, that for
0 = 0.0001 the normalization constants of the function b is several orders of magnitude larger
then the normalization constant of the function m p . thus, the monopole charge density at the
rst peak is indeed very small compared to the baryon charge density.

in analogy to the interpretation of a monopole inside a baryon for large values of 0, one
could interpret the solutions for small values of 0 as a baryon inside a monopole. however, the
gauge eld is nontrivial at the location of the baryon and the higgs eld is not in the vacuum
in this region. thus the baryon would reside in a nearly symmetric phase. one may speculate,
that this scenario might be interesting in respect to the decay of the baryon.

4.3

g > 0

in most calculations we xed the parameter g = 0.
in view of the discussion in section 2
this needs some clarication. the interaction term of the chiral matrix with the higgs eld was
introduced into the model basically for ideological reasons as it xes the value of chiral function
at innity, f = 0 (say). then we assumed that in the limit g  0 the asymptotic value of
the chiral function is stil xed, and that the eld congurations behave smoothly. indeed, we
found from our numerical analysis that this is the case and that the assumption is justied.

let us now discuss the case where g is nite. as long as g is small, the dependence of the
solutions on the parameters 0 and  does not change considerably. in particular the bifurcation
pattern for small values of 0 as shown in figs. 3 persists for small g. the reason is simply
that g enters the dierential equations only as a factor of the higgs eld function h(x). in the
limit 0  0 the higgs eld function vanishes and consequently the equations do not depend
on g in this limit. to discuss the more general case of nite 0 let us assume that for some
parameters , , 0 solutions on the branches a, b and a coexist and form a buttery in the
e  0 diagram for g = 0. then the buttery will persist for small values of g. as g
increases, the buttery shrinks in size and disappears at a critical value of g, e. g. gcr
  0.4

15

for xed  = 0.4 and  = 0. thus, the bifurcation pattern is similar to fig. 3, if we replace  by
0, 0 by g and interchange the role of a and b.

we now consider the case where g becomes very large at xed parameters , , 0.

in
the limit g   the potential (2) becomes a constraint, which for the spherically symmetric
ansatz (15), (16) becomes

h2(x) sin2f (x)  0 as g   .

(27)

note, that this constraint can neither be solved by a vanishing higgs eld function, h(x)  0,
because this violates the boundary condition h(x  ) = 0, nor by a constant chiral function,
f (x)  0 or , because this violates boundary conditions at the origin or at innity. however,
there is a third possibility. if the higgs eld function vanishes on the interval [0, x0] and the chiral
function vanishes on the interval [x0,] then the function h2(x) sin2f (x) vanishes everywhere.

figure 7: the proles of the gauge eld function a(x), the scaled higgs eld function h(x)/0
and the scaled chiral function f (x)/ are shown for g = 104 (solid lines) and g = 0 (dashed
lines) for xed  = 0.4,  = 0 and 0 = 0.03 an the branch a.

in fig. 7 we show the eld congurations for g = 104 and for g = 0 for comparison for
xed parameters  = 0.4,  = 0 and 0 = 0.03 on the branch a. we observe that the higgs
eld function h(x) is indeed almost zero on the interval [0, x0], with x0  23.65, while the chiral

16

function f (x) changes continuously from f (0) =  to f (x0)  0. on the interval [x0,] the
chiral function is almost zero and the higgs eld function changes continuously form h(x0)  0
to its asymptotic value h() = 0. the gure suggests that in the limit g   the derivatives
of the functions h(x) and f (x) will be nite but non-continuous at x0, whereas the gauge eld
function remains twice dierentiable at x0.

taking into account the behaviour of the functions for large g, we observe from the dier-
ential equation for the chiral function f (x) (20), that the  interaction term will be almost zero
for x < x0. assuming that h(x) increases linearly at x0, we nd for large g that for x > x0 the
chiral function decays exponentially with the exponent  g. hence, we nd the following
scenario. for x < x0 the interaction of the higgs eld with the chiral eld vanishes, whereas for
x > x0 the chiral eld becomes increasingly massive. consequently, the baryon is trapped inside
the monopole. on the other hand, because the magnetic charge density is proportional to the
higgs eld, there will be (almost) vanishing monopole density for x < x0 for large g and the
monopole is expelled from the baryon.

5 normal modes

to show the instability of a solution of eqs. (20) we determine the eigenvalues of the uctuation
matrix around that solution. the existence of a negative eigenvalue of a normalizable uctuation
mode indicates that a deformation of the solutions in the direction of this mode lowers its energy.
hence this solution can not be stable. therefore, to show the instability of a solution, it is
sucient to nd a normalizable uctuation mode with negative eigenvalue. for the discussion
of the normal modes we will adopt the methods discussed in refs. [14, 15].

here we consider only radial uctuations around the solutions. we use the dimensionless
coordinate x from the beginning. we introduce into the ansatz small space-time dependent
uctuations (x)eit,  = a, b, c, h, f ,

a(x)  a(x) + a(x)eit ,
b(x)  b(x) + b(x)eit ,

h(x)  h(x) +
f (x)  f (x) +

(28)

and expand the hamiltonian and lagrangian to second order in the uctuation function . as
we are interested in the uctuations around the static solutions, we set b  0, c  0 and extremize
the lagrangian in the background of the functions a, h, f , i. e. whenever second derivatives of
these functions appear, they are replaced by the right hand side of the dierential equations (20).
the form invariance of the ansatz (14)-(16), expressed by eqs. (17), (18), reects itself in
the existence of normal modes with vanishing energy eigenvalue. these gauge zero modes obey
the conditions

a = 0 , c =

, h = 0 , f = 0 .

because we are interested in the non-zero modes, we want to exclude the gauge zero modes. this
can be done by imposing the conditions that the normal modes have to be orthogonal to the
gauge zero modes with respect to the metric

< ,  >bc= z (cid:16) bb + cc(cid:17) + . . . dx .

(30)

(we will give the complete form of the metric later). this leads to the condition on the functions
b, c

k[b, c] = (xc) 

2ab = 0 .

to exclude the gauge zero modes we add k 2 to the lagrangian, where  is a lagrange multiplier.
from the system of dierential equations we nd, that the functions b and c couple to
each other, but not to the functions a, h and f and vice versa. thus, we have two decoupled
systems of dierential equations, which can be solved separately.

found only solutions with 2 positive. for xed values of the parameters we found several discrete

b. their eigenvalues 2
n increase with the number of nodes n. the lowest positive eigenvalue

assuming the normalisiation of the uctuation functions according to (44), we nd the energy
of the solutions to be eahf = 2, i. e. 2 is again the energy eigenvalue.

for the system {ahf} we found normalizable solutions only on the saddlepoint branch
a. for these normal modes the eigenvalue 2 is negative and vanishes at the bifurcation points.
hence these normal modes represent an instability mode of the saddlepoint solutions.

in fig. 9 we show the negative eigenvalue 2 as a function of 0 for  = 0.4,  = 0 and

g = 0.

6 summary and discussion

we have studied a model combining the georgi-glashow and the skyrme systems interacting
mainly through the so(3) gauge eld, with an additional interaction term between the higgs and

chiral elds. this interaction term, which breaks the chiral symmetry and xes the asymptotic
value of the chiral eld at innity, exploits the non vanishing vev of the higgs eld in an
essential way.

the main emphasis of the study is the numerical analysis of the classical solutions of the
model, which may be relevant to the semiclassical approach to monopole catalysis of baryon
decay [3]. the most interesting feature of these solutions, both intrinsically and for the physical
reason just mentioned, is the particular bifurcation patterns that they exhibit. these patterns
are connected to similar bifurcations in the solutions of the gauged skyrme model, not involving
a higgs eld, which has led us to make a systematic study of the relation between the solutions
of these two models. this has been carried out by considering particular limits, in terms of the
independent parameters involved in the monopole-skyrme model, in which the solutions of this
model merge with the solutions of the higgs independent gauged skyrme model.

the above mentioned technical investigations form the centre of gravity of the present work.

from the results obtained, some interesting observations of physical relevance can be made.

one is the particular shape of the bifurcations the solutions exhibit, namely what we have
referred to as buttery in the text. these are reminiscent of the kind of bifurcations appearing
in rst order phase transitions. unfortunately, in the present form of the model considered, we
have not been able to make a concrete description for this phenomenon. this aspect of the work
is under consideration.

the other observation can be made more quantitatively. it was shown that in some limit

22

of the parameters, the baryon resides in the core of the monopole while in the other limit the
converse, namely that the monopole resides inside the baryon. in particular, for the values of the
parameters xed by the phenomenological values of the higgs vev and the pion decay constants,
exactly one half of the baryon charge resides inside the monopole core, and the rest outside.
