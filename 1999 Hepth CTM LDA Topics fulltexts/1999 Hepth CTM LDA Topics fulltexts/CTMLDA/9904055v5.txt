finiteness following from underlying theory: a natural strategy

a tentative proposal is demonstrated that there is a natural strategy to get rid of unphysical
(uv) innities in qfts if one adopts the modern standard point of view that a fundamental theory
that is complete and well-dened in all respects underlies the qfts. this simple strategy works
in principle for any interaction model and space-time dimension. it provides a physical rationality
behind the uv divergence and the conventional renormalization programs and improves the latter
in several important aspects.

11.10.ef; 11.10.gh; 11.90.+t

i. introduction

now, it has become a standard point of view that a fundamental theory (well dened for the extremely high energy
end) underlies the present qfts that are in fact low energy (le) eective theories for the phenomena in le ranges
[1]. but as far as the author knows, we are still lacking a formulation that can yield nite results in a natural way
that fully makes use of the standard point of view. a new strategy is proposed in ref. [2] that indicates the power of
the standard point of view if one uses it appropriately.

to focus on the uv problem, we will assume from now on that there were no unphysical ir singularity in the le
models in our discussions or we have already had an ir regular formulation for the le qfts. (we will discuss in
our future works about the ir structures contribution to the whole formulationit should be included to arrive at a
totally satisfying formulation, especially for qcd-like theories where the ir singularity is rather severe and aects
the theories predictions [3]).

it is convenient to employ a generating functional formalism [4] or a path integral formalism to assemble the green
functions for the le sectors of the underlying theory. it is natural to expect that the well-dened path integral for
an eective sector take the following form,

z{}({j i}) =z d(i

{}) exp{is(i

{}; {ji}; {})}

(1)

where {} are the fundamental parameters (some fundamental constants, probably including the gravitation constant)
from the underlying theory and {j i} are the external sources for le sectors. the elementary elds (i
{}) in the
le sectors are here appended by the underlying parameters to indicate that they are in fact eective ones. it is easy
to see that for dierent le physics, the le limit operation may act upon sets of underlying parameters that dier in
part.

within the path integral formalism, we can easily see that in the le limit (denoted by l{})

z 0({j i};   )  l{}z d(i
6=z d(i) exp{is(i; {ji})},

{}) exp{is(i

{}; {ji}; {})}

(2)

(3)

where the symbols not appended by the underlying parameters refer to the constants and eld parameters given by
the present qfts (i.e., the le limit has been applied on these eective elds or objects). thus, generally speaking,
we can not let the operation of the le limit cross the summation over the paths or the intermediate states. in other
words, the le limit operation and the summation over intermediate states do not commute,

  [l{}, x{paths}

] 6= 0.

(4)

if one ignores such a subtle fact, the resulting formulations would be ill dened and needs regularizations that introduce
unjustied articial substitutes of the true underlying structures, which will in turn lead to divergences may appear
and subtraction is needed. this is our opinion about the appearance of the unphysical innities in some conventional
qft formulations.

1

in the path integral formalism it is immediate to see that the spectra given by the conventional hamiltonian models
would dier from true ones given by the underlying theory, especially in the uv regions. the deviation is signaled
by the ill-denedness or uv divergence in the conventional qfts. more severe uv divergence implies more severe
deviation.

what we are trying to present in the following is that if one starts merely with the existence of the underlying
theory and {} (without knowing the details), there is a simple strategy to calculate the amplitudes wanted without
introducing any ad hoc regularization or cuto that leads to uv divergence. but, due to the lacking of the true
underlying structures, there must remain in our approach certain ambiguities signaling the missing of the underlying
structures, which are to be xed in principle by phenomenology and experiments.

this paper is organized in the following way: we will rst exemplify our strategy in feynman graph language for
the one-loop case in section ii. the treatment of the multi-loop cases is given in section iii. then we discuss some
nonperturbative examples in section iv to further illustrate our proposal. finally we summarize our presentation in
section v. we should note in advance that here we do not claim a satisfactory, systematic and nal presentation of
a new approach, instead we just put forward an alternative strategy for dealing with ill-denedness.

ii. how can uv finite results be derived

from our discussion in section i, we see that the hamiltonians (and hence the propagators and vertices) in their
present forms are the le limits of the ones characterized by {}. to interest most readers we will exemplify our
strategy in the perturbative feynman graph language (we remind that our strategy is denitely not conned to
the perturbative case and we will exhibit the use of the strategy in some nonperturbative cases in section iv).
thus, according to our postulate, the conventional ill-dened (or divergent) feynman amplitudes (fas) are results
of illegitimate operation order with the le limit operation and the internal momenta integration. in formula, if the
integrand f ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}) (of an ill-dened fa) corresponds to the integrand f ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}; {l}) given by
the underlying theory with {qi}, {pj}, {mk} and {l} being respectively loop momenta, external momenta, masses
and the fundamental parameters in the underlying theory, then

dnqil{}

dnqif ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}),

where {c} denotes the denite constants arising from the le limit operation. 0 and  are well-dened (nite) but

dnqi f ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}; {l})

f ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}; {l}) =z yi

0({pj}, {mk}; {c}) = l{}({pj}, {mk}; {l}) = l{}z yi
6=z yi
r qi dnqif ({qi}, {pj}, {mk}) is ill dened. that means, the commutator
{} ="l{},z yi

dnqi#

(7)

only vanishes identically for convergent (i.e., well-dened) fas, otherwise we encounter divergence or ill-denedness
in fas. the deviation of the eective formalism is not detected by the convergent fas, or these amplitudes are well
dened in the present qfts. this is an extremely important fact for our purpose in the following.

as the underlying theory or the amplitudes f (...; {l}) are unavailable by now, we have to nd a way to approach
the truththe 0({pj}, {mk})sfrom our present partial knowledge about the le sectors of the underlying quantum
theory the present form of the hamiltonians or lagrangians as le sectors of the underlying theory.

here is our strategy for extracting nite results out of eective formulations of qft: (1) first we try to perform
certain legitimate operations (say, ) on the objects so that the le limit operation commutes with the summation on
the resulted objects if they do not commute on the original objects. (2) then we can safely perform the intermediate
states summation (e.g., loop integration) on the resulted objects. (3) at last, we perform the inverse operations (say,
1, which should also be legitimate) to go back and the nal expressions should be (uv) nite by construction but
probably ambiguous at the meantime due to our lack of knowledge about the underlying structures. the ambiguities
should be xed from the phenomenological and experimental inputs as mentioned above. the operations (s) and
their inverse are of the main concern in our strategy and they would often be operations with respect to the parameters
external to the intermediate states since the objects of interests are expressed in terms of these parameters after all.
the more general framework eecting the natural strategy proposed here will be the subject of our future investiga-
tions. here, we only show how the strategy works in a simple way for the feynman graph approach, i.e., we exemplify

2

our simple strategy in the feynman graph language. first we show that the following important relation holds for
1-loop case ill-dened fas (c.f. eq.(5) for 1-loop case)

0({pj}, {mk}),

0({pj}, {mk}).

the proof is very simple, since

f (q, {pj}, {mk}) =(cid:0)pj(cid:1)

denoting the dierentiations with respect to the external parameters {pj}s of the amplitude and
0(...) is the le limit of the amplitude calculated in the underlying theory (i.e., the internal momentum integration

z dnq(cid:0)pj(cid:1)
with   1 being the usual supercial divergence degree ofr dnqf (q, {pj}, {mk}) so that the left hand side of eq.(8)
exists (nite),(cid:0)pj(cid:1)
is performed rst). it is easy to see that the operation (cid:0)pj(cid:1)
z dnq(cid:0)pj(cid:1)
=z dnql{}(cid:0)pj(cid:1) f (q, {pj}, {mk}; {l}) = l{}z dnq(cid:0)pj(cid:1) f (q, {pj}, {mk}; {l})
= l{}(cid:0)pj(cid:1)
the second and the fth steps follow from the commutativity of the two operations (cid:0)pj(cid:1)
dierent arguments, the third step is due to the existence ofr dnq(cid:0)pj(cid:1)
existence of r dnq f (q, ...; {l})(= (...; {l})) by postulate.

f (q, {pj}, {mk}) =z dnq(cid:0)pj(cid:1)
({pj}, {mk}; {l}) =(cid:0)pj(cid:1)

it is clear that here the dierentiation with respect to the external momenta and its inverseindenite integration

and l{} as they act on
f (q, ...) and the fourth is justied from the

with respect to the same momenta play the role of the certain operations stated above.

(8)

(9)

leads to convergent graphs or objects.

l{}

f (q, {pj}, {mk}; {l})

(cid:0)pj(cid:1)

(cid:18)zp(cid:19)

the right hand side of eq.(8) can be found now as the left end exists as a nonpolynomial (nonlocal) function of

external momenta and masses, i.e., denoting it as 0

(),

0({pj}, {mk}) = 0

()({pj}, {mk}).

(10)

to nd 0({pj}, {mk}), we integrate both sides of eq.(10) with respect to the external momenta  times indenitely
to arrive at the following expressions

(cid:2)(p)0({pj}, {mk})(cid:3) = 0({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c}) = npl({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c})

(11)

with {c} and {c} being arbitrary constant coecients of an   1 order polynomial in external momenta n  and
npl({pj}, {mk}) being a denite nonpolynomial function of momenta and masses. evidently 0({pj}, {mk}) is not
uniquely determined within conventional qfts at this stage. that the true expression

0({pj}, {mk}) = npl({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c}),

c = c  c

(12)

contains a denite polynomial part (unknown yet) implies that it should have come from the le limit operation on
({pj}, {mk}; {l}) (see eq.(5)) as the usual convolution integration can not yield a polynomial partan indication
of the incompleteness of the formalism of the qfts.

we can take the above procedures as eorts for rectifying the ill-dened fas and represent the fas with the

expressions like the right hand side of eq.(11), i.e.,

z dnqf (q, {pj}, {mk}) >=< npl({pj}, {mk}) + n ({pj}, {c})

(13)

with >=< indicating that left hand side is rectied as the right hand side. that the ambiguities reside only in the
local part means that the qfts are quite eective in the le limit.

to nd the {c}s in eq.(12) we need inputs from the physical properties of the system (such as symmetries,
invariances and unitarity) and a complete set of data from experiments [5,6] (if we can derive them from the underlying
theory all these requirements would be automatically fullled). in other words, all the ambiguities should be xed
according to this principle. similar approach had been adopted by llewellyn smith to x ambiguities on lagrangian
level by imposing high energy symmetry, etc. on relevant quantities [6]. it is also the physical reasoning followed by
the conventional renormalization programs.

3

as we have seen, the cs arise in fact from the low energy limit operation on the objects calculated in the underlying
theory, they should be uniquely dened up to possible equivalence. dierent or inequivalent choices of these constants
simply correspond to dierent le theories (amount to being dened by dierent underlying theories). since dierent
regularizations and/or renormalization conditions might correspond to inequivalent choices of the constants, (the
problem might be more severe in nonperturbative cases [7]), they might lead to dierent le theories that even could
not faithfully describe relevant low energy physics. although the underlying structures do not appear explicitly in
the le formulations, they are not totally decoupled from the eective ones and they stipulate the eective sectors
indirectly through the constants {c}. in other words, these constants missing from the eective hamiltonian models
are just what we need to dene the quantum theory completely in addition to the canonical parameters (masses and
couplings). their missing in the hamiltonian or lagrangian level does not mean they do not exist. as we will see in
section iv, the former studies on the self-adjoint extension [8] of some quantum mechanical hamiltonians just support
our point of view here.

iii. multi-loop case

since the uv divergence would appear if one rst take the limit before doing loop momenta integrations, our
strategy here is just to move the limit operator l{} across the loop integration operations in such a way that no
potential divergence is left over.

for any multi-loop graph  (we will use the same symbol to denote the graph and the associated fa if it is not
confusing), we should again start with the amplitude derived from the underlying theory, i.e., (. . . ; {}) with the
same graph structure. all the internal lines and vertices are again understood to be given by the underlying theory,
characterized by the presence of the parameters {}. then the le limit of (. . . ; {}) produces the denite constants
{c0} that are unknown to us yet

0(. . . ; {c0}) = l{}(. . . ; {}) = l{}z yl

dnl f({l}, . . . ; {})

(14)

where f({l}, . . . ; {}) denotes the integrand obtained from the underlying theory corresponding to the graph  and
the dots refer to the le parameters like external momenta, mass parameters and coupling constants. other symbols
are self-evident. we will use in the following   1 to denote the overall divergence index [4] for any graph  and {l}
to represent the internal momenta and all the partial dierentiation operators and their inverse (1
 ) act upon the
momenta only external to the very internal integration of the graph under consideration. in certain cases, masses
are appropriate or ecient external parameters to work with.

if the graph is totally convergent, then 0 contains no uv ambiguity and the limit operation can cross all the
internal integrations to act upon the integrand to yield the product of the propagators and vertices given by the
present qfts. but once there is any potential uv ill-denedness associated with any internal integration, one must
proceed in the following way (suppose that a graph  contains at least an overall divergence)

0(. . . ; {c0

i }) = l{}z y dnl f({l}, . . . ; {})
l{}z y dnl f({l}, . . . ; {}) = x{}= 

 1


1


l{}z y dnl f({l}, . . . ; {}).

(15)

the dierentiation with respect to the external parameters will give rise to a sum of graphs {} (without overall
divergence) from the original graph . (note that any overlapping divergence will be killed by the dierentiation
operation, only non-overlapping divergences remain, i.e., the overlapping divergences are disentangled [5]). if there is
no more ill-denedness (in any subgraph), one can move the limit operator across all the internal integrations to act
directly upon the integrands f({l}, . . . ; {}) just like in the totally convergent graph case. then one can carry out
all the loop integrations without any trouble for each graph  and then sum them up and nally apply the inverse
operator with respect to the parameters (usually momenta) external to the graph  (and each ).

now suppose there are still some ill-dened subgraphs in each . in this case, each graph in the set  can be
expressed as a product of disconnected divergent (at least supercially divergent) subgraphs (each subgraph itself
may contain overlapping divergences). the le limit operator crossed all the other parts and stopped before the
divergent subgraphs. in formula, for each graph ,it is

internal momenta in the set {l}. : 
refers to amplitude derived from the underlying theory that corresponds to
each subgraph 
j contained in . since some loop momenta are external to certain subgraphs, one can not rst
carry out these loop integrations before the ill-dened subgraphs are treated. this is in sheer contrast to the totally
convergent graphs where the loop integration order does not matter.

j

as the ill-dened subgraphs in [] are disconnected with each other, we now treat each of them separately as a
new total graph just like what we have done with the total graph  starting from eq.(14). then we go through
the procedures from eq.(14) to eq.(17) till we encounter new disconnected and ill-dened subgraphs that are in turn
to be treated as before. finally, we will go to the smallest subgraphs that are completely convergent. now we can
nally remove the le limit operator to get the integrands totally expressed with propagators and vertices given by the
 and 
eective theories and we can begin to perform all the loop integrations with insertions of various pairs of 1
and there will appear a natural order of integration due to our procedures above: the smallest subgaphs are integrated
rst, then the larger subgraphs with their subgraphs done already, and then the still larger subgraphs and so on,
till all integrations are done. [it is worthwhile to note that at each level of the subgraphs, the loop integrations are
guaranteed to be convergent due to weinbergs theorem [9]].

the resulting expression will be a denite nonlocal functions plus nonlocal ambiguities (due to subgraph ill-

denedness) and local ambiguities if  is suering from overall divergence,

0(. . . ; {c0})  (. . . ; {c}) = npl

0

(. . .) + npl

1

(. . . ; {c}) + n (. . . ; { c}),

{c}[{ c} = {c}.

(18)

(19)

here again we used n  to denote the polynomial containing the ambiguities ({ c}) appearing due to the overall
divergence. others are nonlocal functions. dierent from the single loop case, there are nonlocal ambiguities in
this multiloop graph suering from subgraph divergences (as evident from our treatment) in addition to the nonlocal
denite part and the local ambiguous part. the result we obtained ((. . . ; {c})) is not what we are really after
(0(. . . ; {c0})), but that is the best we can do with the present qft.

now some remarks are in order:
a. it is evident that overlapping divergences are just automatically resolved in our proposal, because the dier-
entiation operators just remove the overlapping ill-denedness by inserting internal lines and vertices to reduce the
overall divergence. thus one need not worry about them any more. this is the utility derived from the dierentiation
with respect to external parameters (momenta, masses or other massive parameters that might appear in the le
propagators) [5].

b. the amplitudes given by the underlying theory should be invariant under any linear transformations of the
internal integration variables. in our treatment of the ill-dened graphs, since every loop integration actually per-
formed is convergent, these transformations do not alter the results of the loop integrations. due to the inverse
operations, these linear transformations would at most change the polynomial part. but that does not matter at all.
this observation implies that one should not worry about the variable shifting and routing of the external momenta
that belong to the transformations just described if he has noted the ambiguous part.

b1. an immediate corollary to this observation is that, the chiral anomaly, which is conventionally interpreted as
due to the variable shifting in relevant linearly divergent amplitude, must have been due to other denite properties.
otherwise, if it were totally due to the local ambiguities, one can well remove them away by choosing appropriate
denitions of the constants (or appropriate renormalization conditions). our direct calculation shows that [10], one
kind of denite rational terms (independent of masses) originated the chiral anomaly. since they are nonlocal and
unambiguous, one can not attribute them simply as uv eects. the trace anomaly is also shown to be originated by
such kind of rational terms [10]. to our best knowledge, this nontrivial structure (independent of the uv ambiguities)
has never been noted before in the old renormalization framework.

5

b2. another utility derived from the observation is that, one can choose the routes of ows of the external momenta
to be as simple as possible to make the treatments of an ill-dened multi-loop amplitude as easy as possible. for the
single loop cases, sometimes one may only focus on the parts of the amplitude that are really divergent. this may
yield fewer ambiguities.

c. with the above deduction, one can easily see that the results of any regularization and/or renormalization
scheme can be readily reproduced by corresponding choices of the constants. that is, our proposal can lead to a
universal formulation for all the regularization and renormalization schemes at least in the perturbative framework.
if one wish to pursue calculation eciency in the rst place, one can choose a regularization scheme that saves labor
and then replace all the divergent expressions with an ambiguous polynomial in external parameters to arrive at the
same expressions that can be obtained in the procedures described above. conventionally one has to check whether
the symmetry properties of a scheme would aect the main body of a theory and/or works very hard in order to setup
a scheme as consistently as possible. our proposal spares the labor of checking every corner of a scheme and just
make use of its eciency.

for the ambiguities, as we have discussed in the section ii, we may rst impose some novel symmetries and
invariances on the amplitudes to reduce the ambiguities to certain degree, then one has to resort to the experimental
physics data, a strategy eectively employed in the conventional renormalization approaches. the w-t identities
have served as constraints in the conventional renormalization schemes and saved a lot of labor of calculation. they
are just certain kinds of graphical relations among the feynman graphs. so, in the feynman graph language, we can
derive constraints upon the ambiguities from the graph structures [2].

moreover, it is worthwhile to note that our strategy works in any kind of models as long as they are physically
eective and consistent. that is, it applies eciently to the unrenormalizable theories as well as the renormalizable
ones in the conventional terminology.
it would be interesting to integrate our approach with the bv anti-eld
formalism of qft [11] that has been used to deal with the unrenormalizable theories quite recently [12]. in contrast,
we do not need any counterterm in our strategy for whatever kind of unrenormalizable models simply because we do
not encounter any divergence, the only trouble is to x the ambiguities..

as we have pointed out, the feynman amplitudes or the 1pi functions are generally parametrized by more than one
constants (i will refer to them as agent constants) in addition to the phenomenological ones. if the changes in the
radiative constants could be completely compensated by that in the phenomenological ones (which is only possible for
rather special kind of models), then we might implement a redenition invariance of the phenomenological constants or
parameters for the fas like in the rg case. recently we have rederived the callan-symanzik like equations governing
the scale transformation behaviors of qfts without divergence and bare parameters. the inuences of the underlying
structures eected through the agent constants are clearly shown and these agent constants complete the harmony
of the scale transformation of the eective qfts in the sense discussed in ref. [13]. moreover, the new equations
improved the conventional ones in quite some aspects.

iv. nonperturbative examples

iit is obvious that our proposal works in principle for any model, whether it is a qft or not. the key observation
that the uv ill-denedness is caused by illegitimate order of operations is valid in both perturbative and the
nonperturbative contexts. that is to say, our simple and natural strategy should also be applicable to nonperturbative
case.

recently, the cuto and dimensional regularizations are compared in nonperturbative context [7] in the hot topic
of applying the idea of eective eld theory method (eft [14]) to le nuclear physics following weinbergs suggestion
[15]. the framework is a non-relativistic quantum mechanics with delta-potentials, which is ill dened in the short-
distance. according to our discussions above, such ill-denedness means that the eective le models must have failed
in the higher energy end. then it is illegitimate to simply work with the propagators and vertices (or green functions
and potentials) given by such models. great care must also be taken with respect to the regularization eects. thus
the inequivalence between the cuto scheme and dimensional regularization exhibited in ref. [7] well evidenced the
correctness of our arguments given above.

now let us try to treat the problem within our proposal. generally, the lippmann-schwinger equation for t -matrix

in the simple two-body problems reads (we follow the notation conventions of ref. [7])

t (p, p; e) = v (p, p) +z

ddk
(2)d v (p, k)

1

e+  k2/(2)

t (k, p; e),

(20)

where e+ is e + i, with e non-negative, and  denotes the reduced mass in the two-body problem. in our point
of view, this equation is not well-dened and should be written as the le limit of that derived from the well-dened

6

fundamental underlying theory which is unavailable to us by now. [the underlying parameters will be always denoted
as {}. for dierent problems or dierent le ranges, the contents may dier.] so in our language, eq.(20) should be
rewritten as

t (p, p; e; {}) = v (p, p; {}) +z

v (p, p)  l{}v (p, p; {}),

ddk
(2)2 v (p, k; {})g(e+  k2/(2); {})t (k, p; e; {}),
1

 l{}g(e+  k2/(2); {}).

e+  k2/(2)

(21)

(22)

eq.(21) is now well-dened in the underlying theory. thus eq.(20) is correct only when there is no uv innities (there
is no ir problem in the following discussions for the delta-potential problem) so that the le limit operator can cross
the internal momentum integration (summation over intermediate states). otherwise we have to nd a legitimate
way to let the le limit operator cross the internal momenta integration.

in the case of delta-potential, v (p, p) = c, but the v (. . . ; {}) is generally a nonlocal potential before the le

limit is taken. to be rigorous, we write formally

t (p, p; e; {c0}) = c + l{}(cid:26)z

ddk

(2)d v (p, k; {})g(e+  k2/(2); {})t (p, p; e; {})(cid:27) ,

(23)

here it is not generally legitimate to move the v (. . . ; {}) out of the integration to be directly subject to the le limit
operatorwhich is exactly what was done in the conventional calculations (with only the propagator regularized)and
it is denitely illegitimate to apply the le limit operator to all the other objects before the integration is done. thus,
in principle, even when the le potential is local (of course v (. . . ; {}) is nonlocal), it might be dangerous to simply
reduce eq.(21) to an algebraic one. only when the ill-denedness is mainly caused by 1/(e+  k2/(2)) (i.e., it
diers greatly from g(. . . ; {}) in the uv region where v (. . .) diers less from v (. . . ; {})), could we pull out the
true potential to subject it directly to the action of the le limit operator. in other words, to put eq.(21) (a correct
formulation for eq.(20)) or eq. (23) into an algebraic one requires quite nontrivial properties of the potential and
the propagator. to focus on the main point, we temporarily assume this condition is satised, then we have the
well-dened form of the algebraic equation for the t matrix (which is now parametrized by the new constants {c0}
from the le limit in addition to e),

1

t on(e; {c0})

=

c

 i(e; {c0}),

with

i(e; {c0}) = l{}z

ddk
(2)d g(e+  k2/(2); {}).

(24)

(25)

now we can employ the technique described in sections ii and iii to calculate the integrals, i.e., rst dierentiate
g(e+  . . . ; . . .) with respect to e+ (which is the external parameter in the integral) for appropriate times, secondly
perform the le limit legitimately and carry out the integral thus obtained, nally do the inverse operation with
respect to e and we nd the followings (note that here one dierentiation with respect to e reduces the divergence
degree by two)

id;odd(e; {c0})  id;o(e; {c}) = i

id;even(e; {c0})  id;e(e; {c}) =

2d/2+1
(d/2)(2)d (2e)d/21 + n [(d1)/2](2e; {c});
2d/2

(d/2)(2)d (2e)d/21 ln(2e/c

0) + n [d/2](2e; {c})

(26)

(27)

with {c} being arbitrary constantsthe ambiguities. these expressions can again be viewed as universal parametriza-
tion and compared with that given in cuto regularization and dimensional regularization schemes (c.f. ref [7]) with
the latter ones as special cases.

in terms of the ambiguous (but nite ) integrals given by eq.(26,27), the t matrix is now parametrized by {c} in

addition to e like

again we need to x the constants {c} rather than to renormalize the interaction constant c.

it is easy to see that following the normalization condition of ref. [7], we can reproduce the result derived by
weinberg [15] in two or three dimensional space-time. however, there seems to be no necessary constraints on the
phenomenological constant c as it is physical rather than  bare in our proposal. thus, this le framework a la
weinberg works equally well for both the attractive interactions and the repulsive ones in our approach , contrary to
the conclusions that eft framework failed in the repulsive cases where the le models are believed to be trivial [16].
the nontriviality of the delta-potential dynamics has also been investigated by jackiw [17].

this problem can also be examined from another angle. jackiw had already pointed out [17] that the hamiltonians
for such models are not automatically hermitian and need self-adjoint extension. this has already been dealt with
by mathematicians in the operator theory and has also been extensively discussed in a number of approaches (please
refer to [18] for a comprehensive list of the references). the key point is, in such cases, the self-adjointness of the
hamiltonian is never an automatic property. that is, in contrast to the normal case, the contact potential problem a
la schrodinger equation is uv ill-dened. the resolution of the problem gives rise to a family of self-adjoint extensions
of the original hamiltonian operator parametrized by an additional constant, which upon dierent choices leads to
dierent or inequivalent (le) physics [8]. this additional family parameter is just the constant that will surely be
predicted from the le limit operation in our proposal, as has been emphasized in section ii and iii. as a matter of
fact, there is an approach that is quite the same as ours in spirit, the one based on resolvent formalism [19] where
an important object is dened through an equation in which it appeared in a form dierentiated with respect to the
external parameterthe resolvent variable (energy). thus this important object is only dened up to an additional
parameter (the family parameter in operator theory approach) which is to be determined by other input, just like in
our proposal.

i would like to mention a recent calculation [20] of higgs masses in nonperturbative context employing our proposal.
the results thus obtained are neat and clear, in contrast to that performed within the old renormalization framework
(see the references in [20]). especially, the physical pictures are dierent from that using the old renormalization,
which is easy to see from the discussions above.

one could expect that great ease can be found in employing our proposal or its equivalents (in any form known or
unknown) in his/her studies in the nonperturbative contexts and the outcome would be quite dierent and signicant.
moreover, within our approach, those phenomenologically oriented models which are unrenormalizable in the usual
renormalization schemes could become quite tamed. one can test it with the njl model and chiral perturbation
theory [21] and with gravity [22]. we will further apply our strategy to more concrete calculations and develop more
rigorous framework of this strategy in the future.

v. discussions and summary

for a complete representation of the world, we should expect that the underlying theory is also well dened in the
ir sector. (our discussions in the introduction about the spectra are partial as we deliberately omitted the ir issues
to focus on the uv structures.) it is conceivable that the phenomenological models give wrong information of the ir
end spectra signaled by the unphysical ir innities.

the underlying theory, postulated here, if exists, should contain all the nontrivial uv and ir structural information
lost in the eective theories. then an interesting scenario dawns upon us: for each eective model dominating certain
energy range (say, theory tmid), there should exist two other eective models (or sectors) that are most adjacent to this
model from the ir end and uv end respectively (say, tir and tuv ). then it is imaginable that the phenomenological
parameters in tir and/or tuv would at least quite nontrivially improve the ir and/or uv behaviors of the theory
tmid. while on the other hand, the tmid contains what tir (or tuv ) needs to improve its uv (or ir) behaviors.
put it another way, the active and elementary modes or elds in tir will break up in tmid and give way to the
new elementary modes active in tmid. similarly, the elementary modes in tmid will go hibernating as the energy
goes down while new elementary modes emerge to dominate spectra in tir. the relation between the elementary
modes in tmid and tuv is in principle just like that between those in tir and tmid. of course, there may be modes
active in several successive eective models, some may even be active and stable through all energy levelsthe fossil
modes or elds we mentioned in the introduction. evidently, the information about those elementary modes in tir
and tuv missing from tmid (i.e., missing from the eective spectrum given by tmid) can contribute to improve the
ir and uv behavior of the latter.

of course the author does not have a solid idea for the answer right now. thus we only indicate some interesting
but plausible picture about the resolution of the unphysical ir problem or the reformulation of the ir end of a theory
suered from ir problems like qcd.

from our proposal, the elementarycommutator for a eld and its conjugate, if calculated (or formulated) from
the underlying theory, must have been at least a nonlocal function(al) parametrized by the underlying parameters

8

of the underlying theory and must have been closely related with the gravitational interaction and perhaps new
fundamental ones, rather than a highly abstract dirac delta function containing least information. in a sense, the
incompleteness of the present qfts or their ill-denedness is inherent in the present quantization procedure whose
most elementary technical building block is the dirac delta function (called as distribution by mathematicians) that
is extremely singular and oversimplied in the uv ends. that the distribution theory works necessarily with test
function space or appropriate measure, if viewed from physical angle, is equivalent to that we need more fundamental
structures in order for some singular functions to make sense, i.e., a necessity of introducing underlying theory or its
articial substituteregularization.

in a short summary, we discussed the strategy recently proposed by the author and the important consequences
following from it. the proposal could overcome many typical diculties and shortcomings associated with old regu-
larization and renormalization framework and can be applied in principle to any uv ill-dened quantum theories.

the author is very grateful to professor f. v. tkachov for his encouragement and enlightening remarks.
