anomalous second class; primary secondary; irreducible reducible; regular irregular. reducible case, constraints linearly dependent, possible innite degeneracy = even number degrees freedom nite; see example. regularity refers whether classical constraint taken (say) q = 0 q3 = 0, etc., along quantum repercussions kind multiple choice test. implicitly, assume hamiltonian constraints satisfy minimal consistency condition, particular, set constraints already includes necessary constraints given hamiltonian.. follows, varieties constraints dealt uniform fashion. 2 construction physical space projection evolution operators rst observe extended evolution operator may written form lattice limit given lim 0 y1nn hteir n (n1) h(t) dtihteir n (n1) (t) dti , /n directed product (symbol ) also respects time ordering. thus, expression simply alternating sequence short-time evolutions, rst (t), second h(t), pattern repeated n 1 times. validity trotter-product form follows whenever h(t)2 + essentially self adjoint t, 0 . slight generalization, shall assume h(t)2+m essentially self adjoint t, 0 . real, symmetric coecients (= ) elements positive-denite matrix, i.e., {m } > 0. nite number constraints, < , sucient 4 assume = ;

second-class constraints considered would asking (p 2 + q2)|?i = 0, which, well known, implies |?i 0, unsatisfactory solution. let us relax condition (cf., ) say (p 2 + q2)|?i =  |?i, nonvanishing
