abstract

the system of d2 branes localized on or near d6 branes is considered. the
world-volume theory on the d2 branes is investigated, using its conjectured
relation to the near-horizon geometry. the results are in agreement with
known facts and expectations for the corresponding eld theory and a rich
phase structure is obtained as a function of the energy scale and the number
of branes. in particular, for an intermediate range of the number of d6 branes,
the ir geometry is that of an ads4 space bered over a compact space. this
d2-d6 system is compared to other systems, related to it by compactication
and duality and it is shown that the qualitative dierences have compatible
explanations in the geometric and eld-theoretic descriptions. another system
 that of ns5 branes located at d6 branes  is also briey studied, leading to
a similar phase structure.

1. introduction and summary

in recent years, and especially since the discovery of the so-called ads-cft corre-
spondence [1, 2, 3], it has become clear that many aspects of eld theories can be studied
by looking at the near-horizon region of brane geometries.
in his pioneering work [1],
maldacena considered d3, m2 and m5 branes, as well as the d1 - d5 intersection and
suggested a novel duality: on the one hand there is the eld theory describing the low-
energy dynamics of the brane conguration, when it decouples from the bulk stringy
degrees of freedom; and it is conjectured to be dual to string/m theory in the geometry
near the horizon of the branes. this is a strong-weak duality: whenever one of the dual
descriptions is weakly coupled and can be treated semi-classically, the other is strongly
coupled and the quantum corrections are large. specically, when the number of branes
is large (and, in string theory, also when the string coupling is small) the string/m theory
in the above cases is well approximated by classical supergravity and this can be used to
learn about the dual, strongly-coupled, eld theory.

for each of the systems mentioned above, the brane conguration has a near-horizon
geometry of the adsn+1  sm form, while the corresponding n dimensional dual eld
theory is conformally invariant (hence the term ads-cft). one piece of evidence for the
duality is the match between the isometries of the near-horizon geometry and the symme-
tries of the eld theory. in particular, the isometries of the adsn+1 factor are identied
with the conformal transformations in the eld theory. the ads-cft correspondence
continues to hold when the sm factor in the near-horizon geometry is replaced by another
einstein space xm. the killing spinors on xm determine the amount of supersymmetry
that is realized in the corresponding cft and spheres lead to the maximally supersym-
metric cases. a large class of examples with reduced supersymmetry can be obtained by
orbifolding those spheres [4]-[16]. a general classication of possible einstein spaces xm,
as well as the resulting supersymmetries, has been given in [17, 18]. however, as we will
see below, this product structure is not the most general geometry that can correspond
to a conformal eld theory.

the original maldacena conjecture has been generalized also to non-conformal theories.
this was rst done in [19], where it was shown how an intricate phase structure emerges
for the various branes in type ii string theory. there, the distance from the brane was
identied with the energy scale in the world-volume eld theory and it was found that
the 10 dimensional classical geometry associated with the branes can only be trusted for
a limited range of gauge theory energies.1 when going outside this range of validity two
things can happen. on the one hand the dilaton may diverge, which signals a transition
towards m-theory (for the type iia branes) or to an s-dual regime (for the type iib
cases); on the other hand, the curvature may become large, in which case the geometric
approach breaks down altogether. fortunately, this precisely happens when the gauge
theory becomes weakly coupled. in summary, one nds that for each energy scale there
is precisely one of the available dual descriptions that can be treated semi-classically.
nowhere do inconsistencies arise, e.g. due to two dual descriptions being weakly coupled

1excluding the d3 brane, which corresponds to a conformal eld theory.

figure 1: the phase diagram of the world-volume theory

at the same energy scale. the resulting phase structure for d2 branes is described in the
left part of gure 1.

although the evidence supporting maldacenas duality is, by now, quite impressive,
in order to extend our understanding, it would
there is still much to be understood.
be useful to investigate more systems in which this duality exist and can be eectively
checked.
in this work we follow this route. we concentrate primarily on the d2-d6
system: a system of d2 branes located on or near d6 branes. one of our main results is
the phase structure of the corresponding world-volume theory. it is described in gure 1
and we explain it below.

at low energies  i.e. when the d2 brane dynamics decouples from the bulk  the
world-volume theory on the branes is described by 3 dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric
gauge theory, with gauge group su(n2) and n6 hypermultiplets in the fundamental repre-
sentation (quarks), where n2 and n6 are the number of d2 and d6 branes, respectively.
following maldacenas conjecture, this theory is expected to be dual to string theory in
the geometry near the horizon of the d2 branes. we argue that the relevant geometry is
that of d2 branes localized on the d6 branes. this geometry is known only close enough
to the d6 branes [20], or very far from them (where their inuence is negligible). we nd

2

that the transition between these two regions can occur within the near-horizon range
of the d2 branes and, therefore, it is a transition in the world-volume theory. indeed,
the region close to the d6 branes corresponds to the range of energy scales governed
by the ir xed point, as can be seen by noting that the near-horizon geometry we ob-
tain is so(3, 2) invariant. we analyze quantitatively the geometric identication of the
eld-theoretic energy scale, and determine the bound eir on the range of the ir xed
point.

far enough from the d6 branes, where their inuence on the geometry can be ne-
glected, one obtains the geometry of isolated d2 branes, which was analyzed in [19]. in
particular, at a large enough distance from the d2 branes, the classical geometric descrip-
tion stops being valid, due to a large curvature, while the eld-theoretical description
becomes weakly coupled. comparing the two transition points eir and eu v , one nds,
as required, that they obey eir  eu v whenever the geometric description is valid. in
fact, this is a strict inequality, meaning that there is an intermediate phase. one should
note that the relevance of the geometry without the d6 branes does not mean that in the
world-volume theory, the quarks decouple at high energies. the energy is related to the
distance from the d2 branes and at any such distance there are regions close to the d6
brane.

restricting attention to the ir region, one can consider the dependence on the number
of branes. as in all other systems, n2 must be large to obtain a reliable classical geometric
description. then, changing n6 (relative to n2), the theory goes through several dierent
phases. for small n6, the weakly coupled description is 11-dimensional and the geometry
is ads4 times the orbifold s7/zn6. this system was studied in [8, 9, 12]. by increasing
n6/n2 one goes to a 10-dimensional phase. the geometry still contains an ads4 part,
but now it is bered over a 6-dimensional compact base manifold x6. this is called a
warped product ads4 w x6. it was shown some time ago [21] that the warped product
adsn+1w xm is the most general metric with an so(2, n) isometry. since this isometry is
required for a relation to an n-dimensional conformal eld theory, the exploration of such
spaces is important in the study of conformal eld theories using maldacenas duality2.
when n6  n2 the 10-dimensional geometry becomes very highly curved, so we
expect that, as in [19], this signals a transition towards a weakly coupled phase of the
gauge theory. we check this possibility using eld-theoretical considerations and present
some evidence that for n6  n2  1, the theory indeed simplies dramatically and may
very-well be weakly coupled.
so far we described the phase structure when the d2 branes are on the d6 branes.
moving them o the d6 branes corresponds to a non-zero mass mq for the quarks. we
analyze the corresponding geometry as well, and show that it describes correctly the
renormalization group ow, from the conformal xed point with mq = 0, as described
above, to another xed point in which the quarks decouple. this second xed point is

2warped products were also considered, for example, in [22]-[28]. among those discussed so far in the
context of the ads-cft duality, the one that was constructed explicitly [24],[26],[27] does not preserve
any supersymmetry. moreover, it was shown [27] to be unstable and, therefore, unlike the geometries
studied in the present work, is not expected to be dual to a conformal eld theory.

3

the ir limit of pure n = 8 sym theory (the world-volume theory of d2 branes with no
other branes), which is dual to m theory on ads4  s7  the near horizon geometry of
m2 branes. for large n6, there is also an intermediate phase, where the m2 branes are
smeared over the 11th dimension.

in the above description of the phase structure, we implicitly assumed specic relations
between the various parameters of the system, to display all the possible phases. this
includes

gs  n2gs  1 .

we also assumed that the mass mq of the quarks is smaller then the scale g2
ym set by the
gauge coupling. now one can increase the mass. pictorially, this can be done by moving
the horizontal axis in gure 1 up. the right-hand side of the gure will then deform
smoothly to become as the left-hand side, reecting the decoupling of the quarks at an
increasingly higher energy. in this context, observe that the order of phases is the same on
both sides: localized m2 branes, smeared m2 branes, d2 branes, eld theory and, nally,
the full string theory.

all the information that we obtain from the geometric description, including the phase
structure described above, is in agreement with known facts about the gauge theory and
also with many expectations. this is a further strong support for the duality conjecture.
one of the old expectations is that, while a gauge theory with elds only in the adjoint
representation should be described, in the large n limit, by closed strings, the introduc-
tion of elds in the fundamental representation should correspond to the appearance of
open strings. this is indeed realized in the present system: the d2 branes are replaced
completely by their near-horizon geometry so, without other d branes, the theory is that
of closed strings. on the other hand, the d6 branes do not disappear and a corresponding
singularity in the geometry is a sign that the open strings ending on the d6 branes exist
as additional degrees of freedom.

the structure of this work is as follows. in section 2 we briey review some relevant
information about the gauge theory. in section 3 we analyze the geometry of d2 branes
located on d6 branes. we determine the phase structure and consider other issues that
relate the geometry and the gauge theory: the uv-ir relation and the potential between
quarks. the phase structure is then extended, in section 4, to d2 branes located o the
d6 branes.
in section 5 we consider the qualitative changes that occur when some of
the directions in the geometry are compactied, and the corresponding relations to other
systems. in particular, it is explained why in the d1-d5 system, unlike the present one,
the geometric description is that of d1 branes smeared over the d5 branes. appendix
a reviews the construction of the geometry near d6 branes. finally, in appendix b
we briey analyze the system of ns5 branes located on d6 branes and obtain a phase
structure very similar to that of the d2-d6 system.

note added:

after the completion of this work, the paper [29] appeared, where the question of
localization of branes was considered. in accordance with our suggestion here (in section

4

4), it is shown there that smearing (delocalization) of branes in a classical supergravity
solution corresponds in a dual eld-theoretical description to quantum tunneling between
classical vacua [30][31]. this, in particular, conrms our identication of the geometry
of localized d2 branes as the one relevant for the description of the dynamics of the d2
branes.

2. the field theory on the d2 branes

we will consider n2 d2 branes, extended in the x0, x1, x2 directions. in the absence
of other branes, the low energy eective eld theory on the d2 branes is 3d n = 8 sym
theory with gauge group u(n2). the elds are related to fundamental strings stretched
among the d2 branes. the bosonic elds are a gauge eld and 7 real scalar elds x3x9,
all transforming in the adjoint representation of u(n2). the scalars describe transverse
uctuations of the d2 branes and (the eigenvalues of) their vevs parametrize the moduli
space of vacua.

by adding n6 d6 branes, extended in the x0  x6 directions, one breaks half of the
supersymmetries, leaving n = 4 supersymmetry on the d2 branes. the original n = 8
gauge multiplet decomposes into an n = 4 vector multiplet plus an adjoint hypermulti-
plet. in addition, one generates a set of hypermultiplets  quarks  that originate from
strings stretched between a d6 brane and a d2 brane. these hypermultiplets, which we
denote generically by q, transform in the fundamental representation of u(n2) and also
in the fundamental representation of a global u(n6) symmetry. each of them contains 4
scalars.

2.1 the moduli space of vacua

classically, the moduli space of vacua decomposes into branches, each being a product
of two factors: a coulomb factor and a higgs factor. the coulomb factor is
parametrized by scalars belonging to vector multiplets: x7  x9 and the scalar x# which
is the dual of the gauge eld; the higgs factor is parametrized by scalars belonging
to hypermultiplets: x3  x6 and q. at a generic point in the moduli space, most of
the gauge symmetry is broken and the remaining massless excitations are free. the
origin of the moduli space is a singular point, where all the branches meet3 and the full
gauge symmetry is restored. the gauge coupling constant has a positive mass dimension,
therefore the eective (dimensionless) coupling vanishes in the uv (asymptotic freedom)
and diverges at low energy, apparently leading to a non-trivial ir xed point at the origin.
this situation could be modied by quantum corrections, but non-renormalization
theorems impose severe restrictions on such corrections (as explained, for example, in
[32]).
in particular, the singularity at the origin of the moduli space is not resolved

3this is when all the fundamental hypermultiplets have the same mass, as is the case here, since
we consider coinciding d6 branes. the origin of the moduli space corresponds to coinciding d2 branes,
embedded in the d6 branes.

5

[32, 33]. for the brane conguration, this means that the gauge theory on the coinciding
d2 branes ows in the ir to an interacting conformal eld theory. this is the theory
which is conjectured to be dual to string theory in the geometry described in section 3.

2.2 large number of flavors
in subsection 3.2, we will be led to expect that for n6  n2, the eld theory has a weakly
coupled description. in this subsection we will provide support for this possibility, from
eld-theoretical considerations. the relevant limit is

n2   ,

g2n2 = const. ,

  n6/n2 = const. ,

(2.1)

with large .4 ,5 as was shown in [34][35], in the limit (2.1) the theory simplies and only a
small portion of the feynman diagrams contributes. specically, a feynman diagram can
be shown to dene a surface and the leading contribution to a given correlation function
comes only from planar diagrams  those that dene surfaces with the topology of a
sphere. moreover, considering correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators, one nds
that all the n-point functions with n > 2 vanish in the limit (2.1). in non-supersymmetric
qcd, such a behavior, together with the assumption of connement, was used to argue
that in the limit (2.1), the theory is indeed free, the interaction being suppressed by
powers of 1/n (see [36] and references therein).

in the present model we do not expect connement and, in fact, the theory is not
expected to be free for generic  = n6/n2 (since, for small , we will nd a weakly
coupled geometric dual). one should, therefore, look for something special that happens
only for large . in fact, a further simplication does occur in this situation: the leading
diagrams are restricted not only to be planar but also to have only quark loops, meaning
that if the quark loops are contracted to points, one should obtain a tree diagram6. this is
illustrated in gure 2, where solid lines represent propagators of elds in the fundamental
representation of the gauge group (quarks), the dashed ones represent propagators of elds
in the adjoint representation and the stars * represent external vertices (insertions of
gauge invariant operators). the structure of such diagrams is quite simple. in fact, the
sum over all possible internal quark loops can be performed exactly (it is essentially a
geometric sum), leading to a nite number of eective tree diagrams. this simplication
is characteristic to the large n limit of vector models: models with a global symmetry
group u(n), so(n) or usp(n), in which all the elds are in the vectorial representation
of the symmetry (or the trivial one). it typically leads to the conclusion that the theory
is free in this limit7. presumably, this is what happens also in the present case, although
we will not try to verify this here.

4note that in 3 dimensions, the gauge coupling gym is not dimensionless. the parameter g in (2.1) is
the dimensionless ratio g = gym/e, where e is the characteristic energy scale of the process considered.
5unlike in 4 dimensions, here the number of avors is not restricted by the requirement of asymptotic

freedom, so  can indeed be large.

6all other planar diagrams are suppressed by powers of 1/.
7one such example is the gross-neveu model [37].

3. d2 branes localized on d6 branes

from now on, we turn our attention to the geometry of the d2-d6 system, and inves-

tigate its relation to the 3 dimensional gauge theory.

in this section we consider d2 branes localized on the d6 branes. this corresponds, in
the eld theory, to a vanishing mass for the fundamental hypermultiplets q. we determine
the corresponding geometry in 11 and 10 dimension, analyze the range of validity of the
descriptions obtained and discuss the phase structure that emerges. we also estimate the
entropy and show that it is consistent with smooth transitions between the eld-theoretic
and geometric phases. then we consider other issues that relate the geometry and the
gauge theory: the uv-ir relation and the potential between quarks.

3.1 the geometry

there are several d2-d6 geometries that one could try to relate to the eld theory
described in the previous section and, therefore, it is important to determine which is the
correct one. probably the most familiar one is the conguration in which the d2 branes are
smeared along the directions of the d6 branes. however, the corresponding supergravity
solution [38]-[41] is not the relevant one in the present context8. one indication for this is
that the near horizon geometry does not have the so(2, 3) isometry group, necessary for
a relation to a 3 dimensional conformal eld theory. this issue will be discussed further

8for reviews of (intersecting) brane solutions in supergravity, see [42]-[48]

7

in section 5, where it will become clear that the correct conguration is that in which
the d2 branes are fully localized inside the d6 branes (and of course also in the overall
transverse space). the corresponding supergravity solution near the horizon of the d6
branes has been presented in [20] and can be understood by noting the following facts9: a
set of n6 coinciding d6 branes corresponds in m theory to a kaluza-klein (kk) monopole
[49]. the geometry is that of a r6+1  taub-nut space and, close to the center, it is
well-approximated by the orbifold r6+1  r4/zn6. d2 branes correspond in m theory
to m2 branes, so to add them, one starts from the at covering space of the orbifold, in
which the m2 brane solution is well-known, and then makes the orbifold identications.
in the covering space of the orbifold, there are n6n2 images of m2 branes. when they

all coincide (at the singularity), the corresponding metric for extremal branes is [50]

therefore the geometry is that of ads4 bered over a compact manifold x6 (parametrized

6)12.

as already mentioned at the beginning of this subsection, the emergence of a geom-
etry with so(2, 3) symmetry (which can, therefore, be dual to a conformal eld theory)
depends crucially on the fact that the d2 branes are localized on the d6 branes. indeed,
for d2 branes smeared in k (compact) dimensions of the d6 branes (1  k  4), the
corresponding harmonic function is f2  r6k and the dilaton is no longer independent of
r (see eq. (3.7)). this will be discussed further in section 5.

another symmetry of the theory on the branes that is realized geometrically is the
r-symmetry. these are space-time rotations that leave the m2 brane invariant. in the
absence of d6 branes, the r-symmetry is the spin(8) symmetry of the 7-sphere in eq.
(3.1). with d6 branes, the 3d supersymmetry is reduced to n = 4 and, correspondingly,
the r-symmetry is reduced to spin(4).
in the present description, the d6 branes are
represented by the zn6 orbifold and it breaks the spin(8) symmetry as follows: the
orbifold plane breaks spin(8) to spin(4)k  spin(4), acting on the two 3-spheres in
(3.3). decomposing further: spin(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r, zn6 is a subgroup of
eq.
one of the su(2) factors of spin(4), say su(2)r, and it breaks this factor to u(1)r.
comparing to eq. (3.4), su(2)l is the symmetry of the 2-sphere parametrized by 
and  and u(1)r acts as translations in . now, by analyzing the transformations of
the various elds in the eld theory under su(2)kl  su(2)kr  su(2)l  u(1)r, one
identies su(2)kr  su(2)l as the r-symmetry group, while su(2)kl  u(1)r is a
global symmetry.

3.2 the phase structure

in this subsection we consider the near-horizon geometries of section (3.1) and analyze
the changes in the description of the corresponding theory as the parameters are varied.
we will see, in particular, that the description changes as we vary the number of avors
relative to the number of colors.

the classical approximation and the dependence on the number of branes

we obtained, in the previous subsection, two geometric descriptions  10 and 11
dimensional  of which only in one the quantum corrections can be expected to be small.
the transition between 11 dimensional and 10 dimensional geometries is governed by the
radius r of the circle parametrized by  or, equivalently, by the dilaton  given in eq.

another condition for the validity of the classical geometric description is small cur-

vature. in the 11 dimensional geometry (3.8), the curvature r(11) is

pr(11)  (n6n2) 1

so the classical description is reliable for large n6n2.

and it is small away from the d6 branes i n6  n2. at the location  = 0 of the
d6 branes, the curvature diverges and this singularity is identied as a sign that, in this
geometric description, some degrees of freedom related to the d6 branes were eectively
integrated out. therefore, this singularity is expected to be resolved by adding these
degrees of freedom14. it is clear what these degrees of freedom are: they are the open
strings ending on the d6 branes. this is a realization of the original expectations about
the relation between strings and gauge theory, namely, that pure yang-mills theory should
be described by closed strings, while adding quarks corresponds to adding open strings.
indeed, here the pure sym theory (with n6 = 0), is conjectured to be dual to type iia
string theory in the background of the near-horizon geometry of d2 branes [19], which
is a theory of closed strings15, while quarks appear as open strings ending on d6 branes.
observe that the d2 and d6 branes behave dierently in this context: while the d2
branes disappeared and are fully represented by the geometry, the d6 branes remain
as d branes, in addition to their inuence on the geometry.

to summarize, to obtain a classical geometric description (i.e., with small curvature),
n2 must be large. when this is satised, there are three phases, depending on the
2  n6  n2 there is a geometric description in 10
relation between n2 and n6. for n
dimensions, for smaller n6 there is such a description in 11 dimensions, and for larger n6
there is no geometric description, as the curvature becomes large. in similar situations
considered in the literature (e.g., refs. [19] [51]), in the region of large curvature the eld

13actually, the circle s 1 parametrized by  is contractible (at the orbifold singularity  = 0), so one
might worry that, like the polar angle in the plane, it cannot be identied as a small compact dimension.
to exclude such a possibility, one could require that the radius of the circle r is much smaller than the
distance  from the contraction point. however, whenever r/lp is small, this condition is automatically
satised almost everywhere, i.e. except at distances from the contraction point which are much smaller
than lp. in the present case it is easy to see that r/ = 1/n6 so this is indeed small, due to (3.14).

14the 11 dimensional geometry is also singular at  = 0 (although the singularity is milder  an
orbifold singularity) and this is understood in the same way as in 10 dimensions. see also [51] for a
similar situation.

15although, at low energies, the coupling becomes large and the more appropriate description is m

theory.

11

theory became weakly coupled. as was discussed in subsection 2.2, it is plausible that
this is what happens also in the present model and for n2  n6, there is a weakly coupled
eld-theoretical description.
it is interesting to see what the two types of quantum corrections in the 10 dimensional
description correspond to in the eld theory. the string loop expansion is in e, holding
the geometry xed. holding the metric (3.11) xed means

 

n6
n2

= const.

and, using eq. (3.12), we see that the expansion is in small

e (cid:18) n2

n2



.

this is precisely the large n expansion considered in subsection 2.2 (see eq. (2.1)). now,
from eq. (3.15) we see that the curvature () corrections of string theory lead to an
expansion in small . this is also in agreement with the eld theory, as described in
subsection 2.2: there, the sub-leading diagrams are suppressed by 1/ (see footnote 6), so
 indeed controls the transition between the two descriptions. finally, we note that 1/n6
has in these expansions the same role as g2
ym in the consideration of d3 branes (where
the expansion parameters are 1/n and 1/g2
ymn respectively, with n being the number
of colors, as n2).

the near-horizon range

next, we analyze the implications of the fact that we consider only the near-horizon
region. the near-horizon region of the d2 branes is characterized by the requirement
f2  1. using the eqs. (3.2),(3.9) and (a.3) this translates into the requirement

where

is the gauge coupling constant in the eld theory on the d2 branes. this is the condition
for the decoupling of the branes from the bulk and it can be satised for any given u, by
taking ls small enough, while keeping g2

y m xed.

the near-horizon region of the d6 branes is characterized by f6  1, where f6 is
pu sin2  with 2 in eq. (a.5) and, using

dened in eq. (a.2). by identifying r2 sin2  = l3
the relations (a.3), this requirement can be written as

u (cid:18) n6

sin (cid:19)2

g2
ym .

12

(3.18)

this restriction is non-trivial also for ls  0, so it should be understood in the framework
of the dynamics of d2 branes decoupled from the bulk, i.e., in the framework of the gauge
theory. as will be explained below, the coordinate u is proportional to the energy scale
in the eld theory, so the restriction (3.18) means that the geometric description we
consider corresponds in the gauge theory only to energy scales which are low compared
to a scale eir set by the gauge coupling gym (and n2, n6). in this context, note that the
parameters gs and r# do not appear in the geometry described in the previous section,
so the geometry is independent of gym, as expected for energy scales far below the scale
set by gym.

going further from the d6 branes, their inuence on the geometry becomes negligible
and the geometry is approximately that of d2 branes in isolation. this system was
analyzed in [19]. the geometry is no longer so(3, 2)-invariant, so this region corresponds,
in the gauge theory, to energy scales above those governed by the ir xed point. at a
suciently high energy  in the range of the uv xed point  the eld theoretic description
becomes weakly coupled16. the intermediate region, in which the gauge theory is strongly
coupled but not conformally invariant, is bounded from above by

eu v  n2g2

ym ,

ym

e = n2g2

(since the dimensionless parameter ge controlling the quantum corrections in the gauge
theory is g2
e ). to determine the lower bound eir, as implied by eq. (3.18),
we need the geometric identication of the eld-theoretic energy scale e. this will be
discussed in some detail below (in subsections 3.4 and 4.2), but already at this stage
we can make some simple observations. first, realizing that u is the only dimensionfull
quantity in the geometry (3.11),(3.12), we deduce that e must be proportional to u (as
in any ads geometry). next, consider the large n limit (2.1). as discussed above, the
metric (3.11) remains xed in this limit. on the other hand, the limit is taken with a
xed energy, so the geometric identication of the energy should depend on n2 and n6
only through . this leads to the general form17

e 

u

 ,

so the lower bound implied by eq. (3.18) is

eir  +1n2g2

ym .

in the next subsection we will nd  = 0 (in processes relevant to fundamental strings) or
 = 1
2 (in processes relevant to thermodynamics and supergravity elds). for both these
identications one obtains, as required, that eir < eu v whenever   1 (i.e., in the
16at the corresponding distances from the d2 branes, the curvature is large and the classical geometrical

description is not reliable.

17this can be seen by observing that when the metric (3.11) is written in terms of v = u
n6

u , it indeed depends on n2 and n6 only through .

instead of

validity range of the classical geometric description). note that this is a strict inequality,
which means that an intermediate energy region does exist.

finally we remark that both the restrictions on u discussed above can be removed by
taking rst ls  0 (the decoupling limit of the brane) and then gym   (the ir limit
of the gauge theory).

3.3 the entropy and (no) phase transition

to check the possibility of a phase boundary between the geometric and non-geometric
phases, we calculate here the entropy of the system, when it is at a non-vanishing tem-
perature. for this we should consider non-extremal d2 branes. the non-extremal version
of the metric (3.1) is

ds2

(3.19)

(3.20)

the parameter  is the m2 brane tension above extremality and it is interpreted in the
eld theory as the energy density. following the derivation in subsection 3.1 we obtain,
in the near-horizon region of the d2 branes, the following string metric

eld theory. one is n2  n6. at the transition point n2 = n6, the two expressions (3.23)
and (3.24) for the entropy agree and this is consistent with a smooth transition between
the two descriptions (i.e. with no phase boundary). the other weakly coupled region is
at large energy scales, where the eective gauge coupling ge is small. for n6  n2,
n  n 2
2  n6n2 so (3.23) and (3.24) do not agree, however this is still consistent with a
smooth transition since, as we saw, these phases are separated by an intermediate phase.

3.4 the uv-ir relation

it was suggested in [53] (see also [54]) that a uv cuto in the eld theory  a minimal
distance x  is related to an ir cuto in the geometric description  an upper bound umax
on the distance from the branes. we will check this suggestion in the present conguration.

the field equations

one of the approaches to a uv-ir relation is to consider solutions of the classical eld

equations. for a massless scalar eld , the equation is

where 2 is the scalar laplacian. for the metric (3.11), the laplacian is

2 = 0 ,

therefore, substitution of  = eikxk(x) (where x represents the coordinates of the
space transverse to the d2 branes) in eq. (3.25) gives the following functional dependence
for the solution:

 = eikxk(n6n2

k2
u 2 , )

(where  represents the angles, including ). this suggests [54] the following relation

(3.27)

observe that we included in the above relation a dependence on , through a function
e . such a dependence cannot be excluded, since the geometry depends on . however,
the present approach does not provide information on this dependence (i.e. on e ), since
 enters independently in eq. (3.25).

15

thermodynamics

another way to obtain a uv-ir relation is through thermodynamical considerations.
for this we consider the geometry of non-extremal d2 branes, as derived in the previous
subsection. the hawking temperature t is given by19

(3.28)

, we obtain

(3.29)

the dependence on u, n6, n2 is as in eq. (3.27). since the horizon is characterized by
u =const., the present approach suggests a uv-ir relation which is independent of 
(i.e., e =const. in eq. (3.27)).
a fundamental string as a charge

finally, we consider a fundamental string with one end on the d2 branes and the other
extending to innity. this string corresponds, in the gauge theory on the branes, to a
charge in the fundamental representation of the gauge group and its energy corresponds
to the self energy of the charge. this is one example of an energy in the eld theory
which is related to a (static) string conguration in the geometric description. we will
encounter such situations again later. following [1],[55], we identify the energy e (in the
eld theory) corresponding to a static string conguration with the (minimal) action of
the string per unit time. in the present situation, the action is

s =

1

2l2

s z d dqdet



gx x 

so, for a static conguration x 0 =  , ~x = ~x(), the corresponding energy is

e =

this is the length of the string in the eective metric

with n2 = n6 = 1 and then recover n2 and n6 by

xkn6n2

.

we return now to the present case  a fundamental string with one end on the d2
branes and the other extending to innity  where the corresponding energy is the self-
energy ef of a charge. to obtain a nite energy, we need an ir cuto in the geometry
and a uv cuto in the eld theory, so this will lead to a relation between the two. an
ir cuto in the geometry means that the string extends to a nite point (u, ).20 by
symmetry, for a minimal string, only u and  vary, so the eective metric (3.31) leads to

ef =z sin 

2n6r 1

4

du 2 + u 2d2 .

(3.32)

we see that ef depends only on u,  and n6 and, moreover, n6ef is independent of n6.
therefore, considering dimensions, we obtain for the self energy the following functional
form

ef = e f

u
n6

.

(3.33)

e f depends on  and, in particular, it vanishes for  = 0. however, it is not clear how to
relate this dependence to the eld theory on the d2 branes. the reason for this is that
 6= 
2 corresponds to a string which, if extended from the d2 branes, is not transverse to
the d6 branes. this is not a stable conguration21 and it will decay to a string ending
on the d6 branes. in fact, in the metric (3.11), the d6 branes totally coincide with the
d2 branes (because of the sin  conformal factor), so the string for which we calculated
the action may very well be one that ends on the d6 branes and not on the d2 branes.
the vanishing of ef for   0 supports this identication. if this is true, we should not
identify such a string with a charge in the gauge theory, since this theory describes the
dynamics of the d2 branes only. because of the above complication, we will consider only
 = 
2 .
to obtain a uv-ir relation, we need the cuto dependence of the self-energy of a
. comparing eqs. (3.29) and (3.33), we obtain the

[54],

20this can be realized by placing at this point an additional d2 brane, parallel to the others. the

additional d2 brane is considered as a probe and its inuence on the geometry is neglected.

21in particular, it preserves no supersymmetry.
22recall that we observed this analogy in the previous subsection, considering the quantum corrections

to the geometric description.

17

summary

in this subsection, we considered the uv-ir relation from various points of view and
obtained the same results as obtained previously for d3 branes [53],[54]: one can identify
a relation

3.5 the potential between fundamental charges

a charge in the fundamental representation of the gauge group  a quark  can be realized
by an additional d2 brane, considered as a probe, and by stretching a fundamental string
between this probe and the n2 d2 branes (see footnote 20). a conguration of a quark
and an anti-quark can be realized by two such d2 branes. when, in the eld theory,
the quarks are very far from each other, the energy is the sum of the self energies of
the two quarks. geometrically, this energy corresponds to two fundamental strings (with
opposite orientation), each connecting one of the additional d2 branes to the n2 d2
branes. when the distance between the fundamental strings is decreased, it may be
energetically favorable for the two strings to join to a single string, connecting directly
the two d2 branes. in the eld theory, this would correspond to an attractive potential
between the charges [56][55]. the potential is given by eq. (3.30), after subtracting the
self energy (3.33) of the quarks. we are, therefore, led to consider a string stretched
between (x1, u, 1) and (x2, u, 2), where  represents the angular coordinates23. scaling
considerations, as in the derivation of eq. (3.33), lead to the following functional form for
the energy:

e =rn2

n6

1

xe(cid:18) ux

n2n6(cid:19) ,

where the function e depends also on the angles. as explained above, we know that for
x   (with a xed cuto u) the energy e remains nite, being the self energy of the
23although everything said below is true for any , one should keep in mind that, as explained in

subsection 3.4, we expect relevance to the d2 brane dynamics only for  = 
2 .

18

two quarks. therefore, the expansion of e for large ux is:

e =

u

n6e 1 +rn2

n6

1

x(cid:20)e 0 + o(cid:18) 1

ux(cid:19)(cid:21) .

the rst term is the self energy (being independent of x and proportional to u). sub-
tracting it and removing the cuto (taking u to innity)24, we obtain for the potential

v =rn2

n6

1
xe 0(1, 2) .

(3.35)

to nd the function e 0, one has to solve the geodesic equations of the metric (3.31), which
we do not do here. however, much can be deduced already from the present form. for
negative e 0, the potential describes a coulomb-like (attractive) force (as expected from
conformal invariance), with an eective charge which depends on the angles. when
e 0 > 0, apparently corresponding to a repulsive potential, this actually means that the
potential vanishes (classically), the minimal string conguration being the disconnected
one  two strings ending on the n2 d2 branes. the vanishing of the potential means
that the force between the quarks is screened. from the point of view of the eld theory,
this is the expected result, since the theory contains massless dynamical matter in the
fundamental representation of the gauge group  the excitations of the d2-d6 strings.
screening typically leads to a non-vanishing, exponentially-decreasing potential. in the
present geometry such a potential is ruled out by conformal invariance but this only
means that we are in the extreme ir, i.e., considering very large distances, where this
potential is negligible (see in this context footnote 24). a vanishing potential was obtained
also in [57], and there it was argued that an exponential correction arises as a quantum
eect, related to a singularity in the geometry. here such a correction can appear already
classically, when considering higher energy scales, corresponding to regions farther from
the d6 branes.

4. d2 branes localized near d6 branes

in this section we extend some of our analysis in the previous section to d2 branes
which are at non-vanishing distance from the d6 branes. this corresponds to a non-
vanishing mass mq for the quarks q. the solution we obtain interpolates between the
mq = 0 solution  far from the d2 branes  and the ads4 s7 geometry  close to the d2
branes. since the distance from the brane represents the scale in the gauge theory, this is
a geometric realization of the renormalization-group ow25 from a conformal xed point
24strictly speaking, the limit u   is allowed only after taking ls  0 and gym   (see the end of
subsection 3.2). practically, what we want is to suppress the o(cid:0) 1
u x(cid:1) terms and these will be suppressed
also when u is nite but x is large enough. in physical terms, the restriction on u corresponds to an
eective uv cuto in the eld theory and this becomes irrelevant at large distances.

25a geometric realization of an rg ow in eld theory was also considered in [26],[27].

with massless quarks to a xed point without the quarks. we also nd, for n6  1 an
intermediate region, corresponding to energy scales where massive quarks are relevant. we
combine this information with the results of subsection 3.2, to a unied phase structure,
summarized in the introduction.

4.2 the phase structure

the renormalization group flow

the transition between the high and low energy regimes in the eld theory occurs at
energy scales which depend on the mass mq of the quarks and this mass is related to the
d2-d6 distance rq. thus, before considering the rg ow, we rst determine this relation.
the quarks q in the gauge theory are related to the d2-d6 fundamental strings, so the
mass mq of these quarks is related to the energy carried by these strings. this is again
a situation where an energy in the gauge theory corresponds to a string conguration, so
we use eq. (3.30) to calculate it. the string extends from the singularity, u sin  = 0, to
the location of the d2 branes (the horizon): u = uq, sin  = cos  = 1. for a minimal
string, only u and  vary, thus, eqs. (3.30) and (4.6) give

mq =z sin 

2n6r 1

4

du 2 + u 2d2 .

this expression is identical to that for the self energy considered in subsection 3.4 (eq.
(3.32)), so the answer is given by eq. (3.33) with u = uq:

mq = e f

uq
n6

.

(4.8)

we turn now to the rg ow. at low energies, the quarks q decouple and the theory
ows to the ir xed point of pure n = 8 sym. in the geometric description, this should
correspond to a region close to the m2 branes, where the existence of the d6 branes is
irrelevant and the geometry is ads4  s7. the condition for this is that the sum in eq.
(4.2) is well approximated by 1/r6
, where r is the distance to the nearest d2 image,

and this is the case i r  rq/n6 (since rq/n6 is the distance, in the covering space,
between neighboring images). we conclude that the regime of the above ir xed point
is u  mq/n6 (where we dene, as usual, u = r2
at the other extreme  high energy scales  the mass mq is expected to be irrelevant.
in the geometric description (eq. (4.4)), rq enters through u . for r  rq/n6, the sum

/l3
p).

(4.10)

so, the mass is irrelevant when x  0, which means n6mq  u  u. in this region, the
geometry is as for mq = 0, which was considered in the previous section. comparing the
two extremes, one observes that for large n6, there is an intermediate region mq/n6 
u  n6mq, in which the m2 branes are eectively smeared along the circle parametrized
by .
in the eld theory, the mass is expected to be negligible whenever it is small compared
to the energy considered (i.e., one does not expect factors of n2 or n6 in this relation).
with this in mind, the geometry suggests that when we consider quarks, the energy scale
in the eld theory, corresponding to the location u, is

e 

u
n6

.

(4.11)

note that for large u, when the geometry is approximated by that of massless quarks,
this identication coincides with that suggested in the previous section (see eq. (3.33)).
turning now to the range of the ads4  s7 geometry, the identication (4.11) implies

that the condition for the decoupling of the quarks is

e 

mq
n 2
6

.

the n6 dependence is reasonable: the inuence of the quarks (as intermediate states)
grows with n6, therefore, the energy at which they decouple gets smaller.

reduction to 10 dimensions

next we check the transition between 11 dimensional and 10 dimensional geometries.
as before, this is governed by the dilaton , which for the present case is given in eq.
(4.7):

for rq/n6  r, i.e., when it is valid to approximate the sum in eq. (4.2) by an integral
(see eq. (4.9)), the geometry is independent of . this means that

cos(cid:18)  2k

(1 + x)2

,

x = x  1 ,

y = 1  y ,

with x, y dened in (4.9). this implies

r  rq  x2, y  1 .

combining this with eq. (4.9) we obtain, for rq/n6  r  rq,

which leads to

thus, as u is decreased, r increases. as discussed above, we consider n2  1, therefore,
by the time u reaches mq/n6 (where the m2 branes are not smeared anymore), r/lp
is large and the geometry is 11 dimensional.

summary

the phase structure that emerges from the discussion in this subsection and subsection
3.2, is described in gure 1 (in the introduction). it is assumed that n2  1, otherwise, as
we saw, there is no situation with small curvature. the coordinates are n6 and e = u/n6
and, as discussed above, we identify e with the energy scale in the eld theory26.

at scales below mq we arrive at the conformal theory of the pure n = 8 sym,
corresponding to the geometry ads4  s7. going up in energy, we pass through a region
where the geometry is still 11 dimensional but the m2 branes are eectively smeared.
this region exist only for large n6 and corresponds to a regime in the eld theory where
the massive quarks have signicant inuence. at scales above mq, the mass is negligible
and there are the three phases, described in subsection 3.2, depending on the relation
between n2 and n6. going further up in energy, one gets to the scale where the eective
gauge coupling ge = n2g2
becomes small and there is a weakly coupled eld theoretical
description. before this happens, f6 stops being large and the geometric description
includes also the geometry of isolated d2 branes. finally, at a scale determined by the
string scale, there is a further transition to an energy regime where stringy dynamics is
important.

26recall that this is the identication relevant to processes involving fundamental strings. note also

that this coincides with the identication used in [19]  the action (per unit of time) of a static string.

5 relations to other systems

the d2-d6 system analyzed in this work is related, by compactication and u-duality,
to several other systems. there are qualitative dierences between some of these systems
and in this section we check how these dierences arise in the geometric and eld-theoretic
descriptions. we nd satisfactory agreement and this should be considered as a (success-
ful) consistency check of the proposed ads-cft duality. it is important to keep in mind
that duality is, by denition, a relation between two descriptions of the same system, so
u-duality cannot account for the dierences mentioned above. the essential change is,
therefore, compactication (in one of the dual descriptions).

compactication and the rg flow

we start by compactifying one of the directions of the d2 brane. the corresponding
eld theory is on r2  s1 and it ows from a 3 dimensional theory in the uv to a 2
dimensional theory in the ir. in the geometric description, taking x2 to be periodic with
period 2r2, the physical compactication radius is g22r2. since g22  u 2 (see eq.

(3.11)) and u is proportional to the energy scale in the eld theory, we indeed obtain a 3
dimensional world-volume at high energies and a 2 dimensional one at low energies. note
that we only used the fact that the metric components in directions parallel to the world-
volume increase with u, which is true in all ads geometries, so this correct realization of
the rg ow will exist in any ads-cft relation27.

the d1-d5 system and localization

performing t-duality in the (compactied) x2 direction, one obtains d1 branes local-
ized on d5 branes. however, the geometry obtained does not have the so(2,2) symmetry
required to identify it with a conformal theory on the d1 branes. instead, such a geom-
etry is obtained [1], when the d1 branes are smeared over the d5 branes. in the d2-d6
system, the situation is reversed and, as we saw in section 3, a geometry with so(2, 3)
symmetry is obtained only when the d2 branes are fully localized on the d6 branes. this
dierence has a clear counterpart in eld theory. for localized branes, there is a geo-
metric moduli space of their possible positions, which corresponds, in the eld theory, to
the (classical) moduli space of vacua. in three dimensions (and more), the vacuum of a
eld theory corresponds to specic values of the moduli and, therefore, the corresponding
geometry should be that of localized branes28. in two dimensions (and less), there is tun-
neling between continuously-connected classical ground states [30][31], leading to a single
quantum ground state and this is reected in the geometry by smearing. note that the
smearing is in directions parallel to the d5 branes, which correspond to the higgs branch
of the moduli space and there is no smearing in the other directions, corresponding to the
coulomb branch. this is in agreement with other evidence [59] that the corresponding

27moreover, it also appears to exist in non-conformal dp-branes analyzed in [19], although there the

geometric identication of the energy scale is more problematic, as discussed in [54].

28continuously smeared branes were considered in [58], but this was meant as an approximation to a

specic distribution of branes, which means, a specic point in the moduli space of vacua.

24

world-volume theory is in the higgs branch.

the d3-d7 system and a limit on the number of flavors

next, we consider a compactication of a direction transverse to the d6 branes. this
leaves two non-compact transverse directions and in such a situation, the number n6 of
d6 branes is limited. such a bound exists also in the eld-theoretical description: t-
dualizing along the compact direction, one obtains d3 branes localized on d7 branes,
with one of the d3 brane world-volume directions compactied on a dual circle. the
corresponding eld theory is a 4 dimensional gauge theory on r3  s1. the number n6 of
d7 branes is the number of avors in the gauge theory and requiring asymptotic freedom,
one obtains a bound on n6. to remove the bound, the radius of the dual circle must
strictly vanish (since asymptotic freedom is a property of the small distance behavior)
and this corresponds to d6 branes with 3 non-compact transverse directions. therefore,
we see that both approaches lead to the same kind of limit on n6. to obtain a detailed
agreement, further considerations are needed29 and this will not be done here.

a compactied orbifold and mirror symmetry

finally, we consider the compactication of d6 directions which are transverse to
the d2 brane. to be specic, let x6 be periodic, with period 2r6. when r6  lp,
one can return to 11 dimensions and identify x6 as the small 11th dimension. this
leads to a conguration of n2 d2 branes on a zn6 orbifold. the eld theory on the
d2 branes is qn6
=1 u(n2) gauge theory with matter in the (n2, n2) representation of
u(n2)  u(n2)+1 for each  (with cyclic identication    + n6) and an additional
fundamental for one of the u(n) factors [60]. thus, for large n6 and small r6 there are
two eld theoretical descriptions of the same system and indeed, it is known that these
two eld theories are related by mirror symmetry [32][33].

a compact d6 brane

1

when all the d6 directions (which are transverse to the d2 branes) are compactied,
the dynamics of the d6 branes cannot be ignored and the corresponding eld theory
is a u(n2)  u(n6) gauge theory. the u(n6) gauge coupling is inversely proportional
to v
8 (where v is the compactication radius) so, for innite v , it vanishes and the
u(n6) symmetry is a global symmetry. this seems as a smooth limit, but actually, there
is a conceptual dierence between global and gauge symmetries, the former being a real
symmetry, while the later is a redundancy in the description. in the string theory context,
this sharp distinction is reected by the fact that global symmetries in the branes world-
volume theory correspond to gauge symmetries (and gauge elds) in the bulk, while gauge
symmetries on the brane are not seen in the bulk. we, therefore, return to our model and
check how this distinction is seen.

to obtain the geometry, one starts, as before, in the (11 dimensional) covering space,
and considers an array of m2 branes located at the points of the lattice  dened by the

would role out any n6 > 0.

an ads geometry is obtained only for r small compared to the compactication lengths,
(when u  u), which corresponds to low energy scales in the world-volume theory. this
agrees with eld-theoretical expectations, since at larger scales, the 6-dimensional physics
is no longer negligible. the ads geometry (for small u) is locally the same as for the
non-compact d6 branes. in particular, there is a singularity at  = 0 and, as always, one
expects that it corresponds to additional massless degrees of freedom living there. for
non-compact d6 branes we identied them as the open strings ending on these branes,
and the implied u(n6) gauge symmetry in the bulk31 agreed with the global symmetry
in the world-volume theory. however, in the present situation, the u(n6) symmetry is
a gauge symmetry in the world-volume theory, so the singularity must have a dierent
origin. to nd what it is, one observes that the length of the compact directions vanishes
as  is decreased to 0 (because of the sin  factor in the metric), so the massless degrees
of freedom at the singularity are closed strings winding around these directions. when
only part of the 4 extra dimensions of the d6 branes are compactied, the singularity is
due to both closed and open strings. in all these cases we have agreement between the
global symmetry in the world-volume theory and the gauge symmetry in the bulk.

not be done here explicitly.

appendix b. ns5 branes localized on d6 branes

the ns5 branes decouple from the stringy bulk degrees of freedom when the string

coupling gs vanishes [63].

the resulting world-volume theory is expected to be a non-local 6 dimensional theory
without gravity [63]. it has stringy excitations (which can be thought of as boundaries
of d2 branes ending on the ns5 branes) and is called little string theory. the tension
of these strings is proportional to 1/l2
in the absence of d6 branes, the theory has
s.
(2,0) supersymmetry. it was analyzed, in the context of the ads-cft correspondence, in
[19][64]. the d6 branes break the supersymmetry to (1,0) and add 3 dimensional degrees
of freedom  the boundaries of d4 branes extending between the ns5 branes and the d6
branes.

in this appendix we consider briey the world-volume theory of ns5 branes localized
on d6 branes, as described above. one can repeat most of the analysis of the d2-d6
system, performed in the main text, also for the d5-d6 system and very similar results
are obtained. in particular, also here the geometry is that of a warped product. so far,
there is not much that is known about the world-volume theory of decoupled ns5 branes,
therefore, the information provided by the present approach, as sketched below, should
be useful in the further study of this system.

the geometry

the geometry near the horizon of d6 branes, in the presence of ns5 branes was
determined in [20]. to reproduce it, we follow the same steps as in section 3. for
simplicity, we consider extremal ns5 branes on the d6 branes. a ns5 brane corresponds
to an m5 brane in 11 dimensions. the metric corresponding to n6n5 coinciding images
of m5 branes in the (at) covering space of the orbifold is

the phase structure

the dependence on the number of branes is qualitatively the same as in the d2-d6
system: to obtain a classical geometric description (i.e., with small curvature), n5 must be
large. when this is satised, there are three phases, depending on the relation between

n5 and n6. for n5  n6  n5 there is a geometric description in 10 dimensions

and for smaller n6 there is such a description in 11 dimensions. for larger n6 there
is no geometric description, possibly indicating a simplication in some non-geometric
description.
it would be interesting to consider this limit in other approaches to this
system.

29

considering the dependence on energy, one rst observes that, as in any conformally-
invariant geometry, the energy scale is proportional to u. the restriction to the near-
horizon range of the ns5 branes implies

u 6 

n6n5
s l6
g2
s

,

which is satised in the decoupling limit gs  0, so also in this case the near horizon
condition has the same meaning as in other systems. the restriction to the near-horizon
range of the d6 branes implies

u 2 

n6
l2
s sin 

which is, as in the d2-d6 system, an independent condition (i.e. non-trivial for gs  0).
its meaning is also the same: it determines the domain of the ir xed point which is, as
expected, bounded by the (little) string scale. finally, one can take the ns5 branes o
the d6 branes and realize an rg ow between two dierent xed points, as was done for
the d2-d6 system.
