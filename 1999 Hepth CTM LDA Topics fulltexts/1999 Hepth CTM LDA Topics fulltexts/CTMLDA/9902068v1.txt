we study the potential between a string and an anti-string source in m5-theory by using

the ads/cft duality conjecture. we nd that the next to leading order corrections in a

1. introduction

one of the outstanding problems in m-theory is a better understanding of the world

volume theory of the m ve-brane. in the recent past there have been various publications

discussing that issue from dierent points of view. a small sample of references is given

in [1], [2], [3] and [4]. in the present paper we will use two descriptions of the m-theory

ve-brane. what we will call a perturbative description is the picture that the ve-

brane is formed by defects in eleven dimensional minkowski space which arise due to open

membranes ending on at 5+1 dimensional hypersurfaces. from this perspective the world

volume theory has longitudinal and transversal degrees of freedom. since we will not enter

a quantitative discussion relying on the perturbative description the qualitative picture

will be sucient for us.

(nevertheless it should be interesting to study the presented

conguration from an eective eld theoretic approach.)

the dual description which we will call non-perturbative is based on maldacenas

conjecture [5] (further elaborated in [6][7]), where the ve-brane theory is given by m-
theory on ads7  s4. in the context of this paper we will read the m of m-theory as an
abbreviation for membrane. the precise statement is that m-theory on the space with the

metric

ds2 = l2

pr2(cid:20)u 2dx2

k + 4

du 2
4(cid:21)
u 2 + d2

(1)

is equivalent to the world volume theory of n m5-branes sitting on top of each other. the

eleven dimensional planck length has to be taken to zero in the end. (since it drops out

of all our nal results we will put it formally to one from now on.) in dierence to [5] we
have rescaled the world-volume coordinates of the ve-brane xk  r3/2xk. the radius r
(in planck units) is related to the number of ve-branes by the relation

r = (n )

3 .

(2)

the supergravity solution (1) is reliable for a large number of ve-branes n .

we want to apply this duality to the computation of a potential energy density between

two straight string sources in the m5-brane theory. in the next section we will do this by

a saddle point approximation.

(this is a straightforward modication of [8].)

in the

following sections we will study corrections to this result due to membrane uctuations.

2. the background

in the present paper we take as a perturbative denition of the m5-brane theory

the picture that the degrees of freedom on the world volume of the m5-brane are described

by membranes ending on them. the term perturbative means here that the embedding

space is 11 dimensional minkowski space. (this is in analogy to the perturbative denition

of yang-mills theory on d-branes.) especially we are interested in a situation where we

have one m5 brane separated by a very large distance from a bunch of n m5 branes. in

addition we span two straight membranes between the ve-branes such that they end in

two parallel strings with distance l on the m5-branes (fig. 1).

fig. 1: perturbative picture:

the embedding space is at

on the world volume theory of the n m5-branes this corresponds to a pair of a string
anti-string1. the l dependent part of the energy density of the two membranes corresponds

to the potential energy density of the string anti-string pair in the m5-brane-theory. since

in the perturbative picture the gravitational interaction in the bulk is neglected the force

between the two membranes is solely carried by m5 world volume elds. the l independent

part of the energy density arises due to the self energy of the two membranes. it should

be proportional to the separation distance of the single m5-brane from the n m5-branes.

in the m5 eld theoretic description longitudinal and transversal modes couple to the

string sources. exchanges of longitudinal quanta will lead to the l-dependent potential

whereas the transversal quanta result in an l-independent contribution which diverges

when the single m5 is taken innitely far away from the n m5-branes. here, we are in

the strange situation that we do not know how to compute this potential energy density

in the perturbative regime but we do know how to do it non-perturbatively.

the non-perturbative dual of the above conguration is given by a membrane living
in ads7  s4 with the boundary condition that it ends in two parallel strings separated by
a distance l at the boundary of ads7  s4 (fig. 2).

fig. 2: non-perturbative picture:
the embedding space is ads7  s4

since the fermionic zero-modes of the membrane background in ads7  s4 are zero
for our problem we can obtain the conguration of g. 2 by minimizing the world volume

of the membrane which is the nambu-goto action

s =

(3)

where a = (, , ) labels the world volume coordinates of the membrane and g is the
metric of the embedding space (1). we chose a static gauge

x 0 = 

, x 1 =  , x 2 = .

(4)

further we take the ansatz u = u () and the rest of the embedding coordinates is

constant. like in the string case one can employ the explicit  independence of the

lagrangian to reduce the equations of motion to a rst order dierential equation

(11)

a few remarks are in order. by rescaling xk  r3/2xk we had changed the world volume
of the m5-brane. to undo this we should divide the energy densities by r3 but at the

4

same time also replace l  r3/2l 2. this removes the r dependence of the self energy
contribution (10) but leaves the potential energy (11) unchanged. upon compactifying x 2

and  on a circle (double dimensional reduction) one obtains a coulomb law in a 4 + 1

dimensional theory - a result which has been used already in [9]. even though its derivation

is a straightforward modication of the one given in [8] we decided to present it in some

detail since in the rest of the paper we will study uctuations around this background

membrane.

3. fluctuations

the result of the previous section is valid for large r where the supergravity back-

ground (geometry) is reliable as well as the saddle point approximation is good. in [10] it

was argued that there are no corrections to the geometry due to nite n . therefore, we

will focus on corrections resulting from uctuations around the background membrane. in

order to do so we have also to include the fermionic uctuations. a -symmetric action
for the membrane on ads7  s4 can be found in [11]. after rescaling their fermionic coor-
dinates   r the only r dependence of the action appears as an overall factor of r3.

therefore the loop expansion gives a power series in 1/r3. we will be interested in the

next to leading order (r0) contribution to the potential energy density (11). to this end,

we need to background eld expand the membrane action to second order in uctuations.

since the background in the s4 direction and in fermionic directions is trivial the bosonic
uctuations in ads7 direction, in s4 direction and in fermionic directions decouple and

we can discuss their actions separately. in order to obtain translation invariant functional

measures we use the normal coordinate expansion developed in [12]. there uctuations

are parameterized by tangent vectors a (with a being a lorentz index) to geodesics con-

necting the background with its uctuation. it is useful to take the world volume metric

to be the full induced metric because it saves one from dealing with constraints. with this

remarks the calculation should be straightforward and we will not enter into its details but

just present the results.

2 these rescalings may look strange at the rst sight but are correct. the energy density is
measured with respect to a volume which is r3 times smaller than the original one (including the
time) and our l has to be expressed in terms of the original one which is r3/2 times bigger.

note that the jacobian of this redenition is one. the new elds k,  are uctuations

which lie in the one-six plane and parameterize uctuations parallel respectively perpen-

dicular to the background membrane.

we observe that (12) degenerates since it does not depend on 0, 2, and k. this

originates from the freedom of performing world volume dieomorphisms. we remove the

degeneracy by gauge xing

3.2. fluctuations in s4 direction

0 = 2 = k = 0.

(15)

since the background is trivial in the s4 direction we obtain a very simple action

quadratic in a (a = 7, . . . , 10)

(16)

3.3. fluctuations in fermionic directions

in order to obtain the part of the action quadratic in fermionic uctuations we need

to take the part of the membrane action [11] bilinear in fermions and plug in there our
background for the bosons. then one obtains a result containing only a (a = 0, . . . , 6),

6

where a denotes an eleven dimensional gamma-matrix. now, one can write a = a5
where a is a gamma-matrix of the seven-dimensional tangent space of ads7 and 5
belongs
to the tangent space of s4. we split our 32-component spinor into two sixteen component
spinors 1, 2 according to their eigenvalue with respect to 5

further we should x -symmetry. a -xed action of the membrane on ads7  s4 is
discussed in [13], for our purpose we nd a dierent gauge xing convenient however.

plane (the s commute with a). for 2 we obtain the same equation (21) but with 1
replaced by 1. so, the condition (19) allows us to write the equations of motion for the

metamorphosed into world-volume spinors.

where 0 is the laplacian with respect to (13) acting on scalars. the power in the fermionic
determinant (in the denominator) results from 32 real fermionic components which have

been reduced to 16 by -xing. since  is an eight by eight matrix and we have squared

the fermionic operators we arrive at the expression (26). unfortunately we are not able to

evaluate the full expression (26). however, we can extract the uv-divergent contributions.

the formulas we are going to use can be found e.g. in [14]. in 2 + 1 dimensions there are

two potentially divergent contributions to the eective action. for an operator of the form
 + e there is a cubic divergency

a0 =

1

3 (4) 3

2 tr1

(27)

where the trace is taken over all elds and includes an integration with the covariant

measure. since in our case the laplacian is dimensionless (u has mass dimension one)

the short distance cut-o  is dimensionless as well. (when taking the limit of vanishing

planck length the short distance cut-o in planck units is held xed.) from (26) we see

that we do not encounter cubic divergences. the linear divergency is

(32)

so, both the self energy and the potential energy are renormalized.

4. conclusions

starting from the maldacena conjecture and assuming that m-theory is described by

membranes we computed the potential energy density between a string and an anti-string

source in the m5-brane theory. we found that after double dimensional reduction the

potential energy follows a 4 + 1 dimensional coulomb law. then we discussed corrections

to this result due to membrane uctuations to the next to leading order. we proposed a

way of world volume dieomorphism and -symmetry xing which seems suitable for the

given problem. finally, we found that the next to leading order renormalizes the classical

result.

analogous techniques can be applied to the wilson loop computation based on the
duality between n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory and string theory on ads5  s5
[8]. a publication dealing with that case is in preparation [15]. but even without going

through the details of the calculation one can guess what to expect. according to [16]
divergent contributions to the partition function of the string on ads5  s5 result at most
in a constant contribution to the dilaton beta-function. hence, a potential divergency

3 we take care of the halfs in front of the logarithms in (26) by restricting the  integration

on the region between zero and l/2.

9

will arise with a factor r hr(2) where h is now the induced metric resulting from the

background discussed in [8]. computing this integral one nds that it only contains a self

energy contribution (in the case of d3 branes one can associate this to a w mass via the

higgs mechanism).

it should be interesting to extend the presented discussion to the nite temperature

case. there it may be possible to deduce in certain limits more than just the divergent

contributions to the partition function (cf [17]).
