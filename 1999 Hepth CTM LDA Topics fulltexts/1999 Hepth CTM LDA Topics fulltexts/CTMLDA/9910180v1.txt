abstract

we study a possibility for pseudoclassical description of a spinning particle

in external electromagnetic and torsion elds. to this end we depart from the

dirac equation in such a background and derive a path integral representa-

tion for the corresponding propagator. an eective action which appears in

the representation is interpreted as a pseudoclassical action for the spinning

particle. it is a generalization of berezin-marinov action to the background

under consideration. pseudoclassical equations of motion in the nonrelativis-

tic limit reproduce exactly the classical limit of the pauli quantum mechanics

in the same case. quantization of the action appears to be nontrivial due to

an ordering problem, which needs to be solved to construct operators of rst-

class constraints, which select the physical sector. finally the quantization

leads to dirac equation in the given background. thus, one may believe that

the derived action is a solution of the problem under consideration.

i. introduction

introducing of torsion is usually regarded as a most natural way to extend the descrip-

tion of the space-time in general relativity. torsion appears naturally as a compensating

eld for local gauge transformations [1] (see [2,3] for a review of this approach and further

references) and also in the eective low-energy gravity induced by quantum eects of (su-

per)strings. the main advantage of theories with torsion is that the spin of matter particles

(elds), along with energy and momentum ecomes the source of gravity. this is the reason

why so much attention has been paid to the interaction between torsion and fermion elds

[4,2,57]. in particular, in [7] the action of a spinning particle in an external torsion eld has

been obtained on the basis of supersymmetry. the particle action provides, in some respect,

a better understanding of the physical eects of torsion, especially for the nonrelativistic

case [8]. in this paper, we are going to discuss a similar problem, namely, to construct a

pseudoclassical supersymmetric action for a spinning particle in external torsion and electro-

magnetic elds, which is consistent with the requirements of quantum eld theory in curved

space-time with torsion, and also ts with nonrelativistic and classical limits.

some remarks are in order. as far as one is considering the quantum eects together

with torsion, there are two distinct possibilities. the rst of them supposes to consider

torsion along with other elds. then one has to start with the formulation of dynamics

of the proper torsion [10]. the theory of the propagating torsion allows one to study its

phenomenological consequences, especially in the high energy domain [9,10]. at the same

time, dynamical torsion meets serious theoretical obstacles. as it was shown in ref. [10]

there is a unique choice of the action for dynamical torsion coupled to fermions, such that

there is not any open contradiction with the consistency of the quantized theory at one-

loop level. moreover, even this unique theory becomes contradictory if one incorporates

scalar elds. furthermore, at higher loops some problems show up even in the torsion-

fermion systems without scalars [11], and therefore the possibilities to have a theory of

torsion remaining consistent under quantization, depends on the existence of some unknown

4

symmetries which should (allegedly) solve the problems indicated in [10,11]. the second

possibility is to treat torsion as a background eld which is, by denition, not an object for

the quantization. then, on the quantum level, one meets the theory of matter elds in an

external gravitational eld with torsion. the formulation of a renormalizable theory of this

kind has been given in [12] and some interesting aspects, including conformal anomaly and

cosmological applications, has been studied in [13] (see also [14] for the introduction). using

the results of [12], the pauli equation in external electromagnetic and torsion elds has been

derived in [8] 1, and the corresponding equations of motion for the non- relativistic particle

were obtained. these equations show an interesting and unusual behavior of the spinning

particle in an external torsion eld [19].

in the present work, as was already said, we are going to study a pseudo-classical descrip-

tion for scalar and spinning particles in an external torsion eld. to this end we are going to

follow the ideas of a series of papers [20,21]. it was demonstrated there that a special kind of

path integral representations for causal green functions of relativistic wave equations allows

one to derive a form of the classical (pseudoclassical) action for the corresponding particles.

in such a way, the action for spinning particles with anomalous magnetic moments, and also

actions for spinning particles in odd- dimensional space-time, have been derived for the rst

time [23,21].

the paper is organized in the following way. in the next section we present some con-

siderations [12], which allow us to justify a form of dirac and klein-gordon equations in

external gravitation eld with torsion. in sect.iii we introduce an equation for the dirac

propagator in electromagnetic and torsion elds. using it, a path integral representation

for the propagator is derived. analyzing this representation, in sect.iv, we propose a pseu-

doclassical action to describe a spinning particle in the above-mentioned background. it is

1earlier some particular form of the pauli equation has been used in [15]. after [8], pauli equation

with torsion has been derived in ref.s [1619].

a generalization of the berezin-marinov action [25,26] to the background under considera-

tion. in a similar manner a classical action for a scalar particle can be derived. we study

equations of motion and consider the nonrelativistic and classical limits. in sect.v doing a

quantization of the action we arrived at the corresponding dirac equation. results of two

latter sections conrm the interpretation of the pseudoclassical action derived by us from

the path integral representation. in the last sect.vi we draw some conclusions.

ii. dirac and klein-gordon equations in an external

gravitational field with torsion

let us start with the basic notions of gravity with torsion. all our notations correspond

to those of the book [14]. the metric g and torsion t 
 are independent characteristics
of the space-time. when torsion is present, the covariant derivative  is based on the non-
 . the metricity condition g = 0 enables
symmetric connection, namely 


 = t 



one to express the connection through the metric and torsion in a unique way as



 = 

 +

1

2(cid:16)t 

  t 

t 

(cid:17) ,

(2.1)

where 

 = 1/2 g ( g +  g   g) is usual christoel symbol. the torsion

eld can be expressed through its irreducible components as

t =

1
3

(t g  t g)

1
6

 s + q ,

(2.2)

where t = t 

  is the vector trace of torsion, s =  t is the axial vector and the

tensor q

 satises two conditions q

 = 0 and q = 0.

to construct the actions of matter elds in an external gravitational eld with torsion

one has to impose the principles of locality, general covariance and require the symmetries

of the given theory (like gauge invariance for the qed or sm) in at space-time to hold

for the generalized theory in curved space-time with torsion. then the renormalizable eld

theory can be achieved without the introduction of the new parameters with the dimension

of inverse mass [12] (see also [14]).

6

the above conditions x the form of the action apart from the values of some new

parameters which remain arbitrary. these new quantities are called non-minimal parameters

and parameters of the vacuum action. the general vacuum action for gravity with torsion

is extremely bulky [24]. in this paper we will consider only the matter sector of the theory

and do not discuss the renormalization of the vacuum energy (see, for example, [13,14]).

for the gut-like gauge theory of interacting elds with spin-0, 1

2 and 1, the full action

with all the non-minimal parameters can be written as [12]

s =z d4xg (cid:26)

1

4 (cid:16)ga
(cid:17)2

1

2 (cid:16)x i pi + m 2(cid:17) 2

v () + i (cid:16) d +x j qj  im + h(cid:17) o + svac ,

(2.3)

where d denotes the derivatives which are covariant with respect to both gravitational and
gauge eld but do not contain torsion. we accept that the vector elds do not couple with

torsion even in a minimal way, in order to maintain the gauge invariance. interaction of
scalar elds with torsion is purely non-minimal, because for scalars  =  = . for
one real scalar there are ve possible non-minimal structures

p1 = r, p2 =  t , p3 = t t , p4 = s s, p5 = q q

and corresponding non-minimal parameters 1, .., 5. a more complicated scalar content

may require additional non-minimal terms [12,14]. for the dirac spinors there are two

possible non-minimal structures

q1 = i5  s,

q2 = i t

and two nonminimal parameters 1, 2.

the action of the minimal theory for the dirac spinor eld, is given by the expression

(see, for example, [2,14])

s =

i

2 z d4xg (cid:16)     
= i z d4xg  (cid:18)   

i
8

    2im (cid:17) =

5 s  im(cid:19)  .

7

(2.4)

therefore, minimally the dirac spinor interacts only with the s part of the torsion ten-

sor (2.2), and this minimal interaction corresponds to 1 = 1/8, 2 = 0 in the general
expression (2.3).

it is easy to see that, among all the non-minimal parameters, the ones related to the s-

eld are most essential for the renormalizability. if one starts from the minimal theory, then

the value of 1 is dierent from zero according to (2.4). the fermion propagator depends

on the background torsion, and the loop contributions produce 1 and 4-type divergences.

therefore, the minimal theory is nonrenormalizable [12]. however, the renormalizability

can be achieved by including 1 and 4type structures into the classical action [12]. the

situation is very similar to the one with the nonminimal parameter 1 r2 of the metric-

curvature interaction. it is remarkable that not only spinors but also scalars have to interact

with torsion if we want to have a renormalizable theory. other parameters 2, 2,3,5 are

purely non-minimal. this means that they all can be set to zero simultaneously without

loss of consistency. for this reason in the rest of this paper we will consider the torsion as

purely antisymmetric and describe it by the axial vector2 s.

since torsion is a quantity which is independent of the metric, one can investigate the

theory with torsion and the at minkowski metric. on the other hand, since we are going to

consider torsion as purely background eld, it can be always normalized in such a way that

the non-minimal parameter 1 is set to unity. therefore, the dirac equation in external

electromagnetic and torsion elds can be presented in the form:

h  (cid:16) p  i5s(cid:17)  mi (x) = 0 ,

(2.5)

where p = i  qa(x).

at the same time, the parameter 4 has to remain arbitrary, and hence the klein-gordon

equation in external electromagnetic and torsion elds has the form

h p 2 + m2 + 4 s2i (x) = 0 .

(2.6)

2it is worth to mention that the string-induced torsion is completely antisymmetric as well.

8

iii. path integral representations for the propagators

in this section we are going to write down path integral representations for the propaga-

tors of spinning and spinless particles in the background under consideration, following the

techniques of refs. [20,21]. in this relation one ought to mention the works [22] where the

propagators were presented as path integrals over bosonic and fermionic variables.

first we start with the case of a spinning particle and consider the causal green function

c(x, y) of the equation (2.5), which is the propagator of the corresponding particle,

h  (cid:16) p  i5s(cid:17)  mi c(x, y) = 4(x  y) .

(3.1)

to get the result in supersymmetric form one needs to work with the transformed function

c(x, y) = c(x, y)5, which obeys the equation

h  (cid:16) p  i4s(cid:17)  m4i c(x, y) = 4(x  y),

(3.2)

where the set of ve matrices n, n = 0, 1, .., 4, forms a representation of the cliord algebra

in 5- dimensions,

 = 5, 4 = 5,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,

[n, m]+ = 2 nm ,

nm = diag(1,1,1,1,1) .

(3.3)

similar to schwinger [27] we present c

(x, y) as a matrix element of an operator c

,

however, in contrast with the cited work, we do this in the coordinate space only,

c
(x, y) = hx| c

|yi .

(3.4)

in (3.4) spinor indices are written for clarity explicitly and will be omitted hereafter; |xi are
eigenvectors for some hermitian operators of coordinates x , the corresponding canonically

conjugated operators of momenta are p, so that:

hx|yi = 4(x  y) ,
p|pi = p|pi ,

z |xihx|dx = i ,
hp|pi = 4(p  p) ,

x |xi = x|xi ,
[p, x ] = i
 ,
z |pihp|dp = i ,
[, ] = iqf(x) ,

hx|p|yi = i4(x  y) ,

hx|pi =

1
(2)2 eipx ,

 = p  qa(x) , f(x) = a  a .

9

the equation (3.2) implies the formal solution for the operator c:

c = bf 1 ,

bf =   m4  i4s .

the operator bf may be written in an equivalent form,

bf =   m4 

i
6

s ,

(3.5)

using the following formula

4 =

1
6

  ,

0123 = 1 .

that allows one to regard it as a fermi operator, if one reckons -matrices as fermi

operators. in general case an inverse operator to a fermi operator bf can be presented by

means of an integral over a super-proper time (, ) of an exponential with an even exponent

[20],

bf 1 =z 

0

dz ei[(bf 2+i)+bf ]d  ,

where  is an even and  is an odd (grassmann) variable, the latter anticommutes with bf
by denition. calculating bf 2 in the case under consideration when bf is given by (3.5), we

nd

bf 2 = 2  m2  s2

where

f  + k  + s 0123 ,

(3.6)

k =

i

2h , si+

,

2 = p 2 + q2a2 + q [p, a]+ .

(3.7)

thus we get:

where

c =z

dz ei h(,)d ,

h(, ) = (cid:18)m2 + s2  2 +
s 0123(cid:17)  (cid:18)  m4 i

then, the green function c(xout, xin) takes the form:

c(xout, xin) =z 

0

dz hxout|ei h(,)|xinid .

(3.8)

now we are going to represent the matrix element entering in the expression (3.8) by

means of a path integral following a technique of refs. [20,21]. first we write, as usual,

ei h = (cid:16)ei h/n(cid:17)n

all the operators ei h/n . besides, we introduce n additional integrations over  and 

and then insert (n  1) resolutions of identity r |xihx|dx = i between

to transform then the ordinary integrals over these variables into the corresponding path-

integrals:

c(xout, xin) = lim

nz 

0

d 0z nyk=1hxk|ei h(k,k)|xk1i

(k  k1) (k  k1) d0 dx1 ... dxn 1d 1...d n d 1...d n ,

(3.9)

where  = 1/n, x0 = xin, xn = xout. bearing in mind the limiting process, we can, as

usual, restrict ourselves to calculate the matrix elements from (3.9) approximately,

hxk|ei h(k,k)|xk1i  hxk|1i h(k, k)|xk1i .

(3.10)

in this connection it is important to notice that the operator h(k, k), by construction, is
symmetric with respct to the operators x and p . thus, one can write

h(, ) = sym(x,p ) h(, , x, p ),

where h(, , x, p) is the weyl symbol of the operator h(, ) in the sector of x, p,

h(, , x, p) = (cid:18)m2 + s2  p 2 +
s 0123(cid:17)  (cid:18)p  m4 i

iq
2

6

f  k
s(cid:19) ,

and

p = p  qa(x) ,

k = p s .

(3.11)

(3.12)

the matrix elements (3.10) are expressed in terms of the weyl symbols at the middle point

xk = (xk + xk1)/2, see [28]. taking all that into account, one realizes that in the limiting

process the matrix elements (3.10) can be replaced by the expressions

11

(2)4 exp i(cid:20)pk
z d pk

xk  xk1



 h(k, k, xk, pk)(cid:21)  .

(3.13)

such expressions with dierent values of k do not commute due to the -matrix structure

and, therefore, are to be situated in (3.9) in such a way that the numbers k increase from

the right to the left. for the two -functions, accompanying each matrix element (3.10) in

the expression (3.9), we use the integral representations

(k  k1)(k  k1) =

i

2z ei[k(kk1)+k(kk1)]d kd k ,

where k are odd variables. then we attribute formally to the -matrices, entering into

(3.13), also an index k, and at the same time we attribute to all quantities the time k

according the index k they have, k = k , so that   [0, 1]. introducing the t-product,
which acts on - matrices, it is possible to gather all the expressions, entering in (3.9), in

one exponent and deal then with the - matrices like with odd variables. at equal times

the - matrices anticommute due to their contractions to complete antisymmetric objects.

taking into account all that, we get for the right side of (3.9):

where x( ), p( ), ( ), ( ), are even and ( ), ( ) are odd trajectories, obeying the

boundary conditions x(0) = xin, x(1) = xout, (0) = 0, (0) = 0. the operation of

t-ordering acts on the -matrices which are supposed formally to depend on time  . the

the discussion of the role of the measure (3.18) can be found in [20].

let us now pass to the case of a spinless particle. here we need to consider a cor-

responding propagator dc which obeys the nonhomogeneous klein-gordon equation (see

(2.6)

hp 2 + m2 + 4 s2i dc(x, y) = 4(x  y) .

(3.19)

its path integral representation may be obtained from one (3.17) for the spinning particle

if one drops there all odd variables and remember that in this case the torsion eld s can

not be anymore normalized to set the parameter 4 to unity, and s2 has to be multiplied by

this parameter. thus, we get

dc(xout, xin) = i

iv. pseudoclassical action for the spinning particle and

classical equations of motion in the nonrelativistic limit

the exponent in the integrand (3.17) can be considered as an eective and nondegenerate

lagrangian action of a spinning particle in electromagnetic and torsion elds. it consists of

two principal parts. the rst one, which unies two summands with the derivatives of e

and , can be treated as a gauge xing term sgf,

sgf =z 1

0

( e +  ) d ,

14

and corresponds, in fact, to gauge conditions e =  = 0. the rest part of the eective

action can be treated as a gauge invariant action of a spinning particle in the eld under

consideration. it has the form

the action (4.1) is a generalization of berezin-marinov action [25,26] to the background

with torsion. one can verify that there are two types of gauge transformations, under which

the actions is invariant, in accordance with two gauge conditions and two primary rst-class

constraints (see below). the rst one presents usual reparametrizations, and second one a

generalization of supertransformations in such kind of models.

let us analyze the equations of motion for theory with the action (4.1).

(4.6)

one can choose (it is also may be seen from the hamiltonian analysis which follows) the

gauge conditions  = 0 and e = 1/m to simplify the analysis of the equations (4.4-4.6). in

order to perform the nonrelativistic limit we dene the three dimensional spin vector ~ as

(4.8)

as a part of the nonrelativistic approximation, and also use standard relations for the com-

ponents of the stress tensor:

f0i = ei = 0ai  ia0

and

fij = ijk h k .

substituting these formulas into (4.6) and (4.5), disregarding the terms of higher orders in

the external elds, we arrive at the equations:

the pauli equation in the same background. that conrms our interpretation of the action

(4.2). additional arguments in favor of the interpretation will be obtained in the next

section, where we are going to quantize of the action.

a corresponding classical gauge invariant action for spinless particle, which may be

extracted from (3.20), has the form

ssc =

" 

1z0

x2
2e 

e
2

sc  q xa# d .

m 2

(4.10)

we can see that it exhibits interaction between the particle and torsion. the dependence on

the background torsion enters the equations of motion of the particle (in a very nontrivial

way for the coordinate-dependent torsion) and therefore the presence of a torsion may be

detected not only for the spinor, but also for scalar particles.

16

v. quantization of the pseudoclassical action

going over to the hamiltonian formalism, we introduce the canonical momenta:

p =

pe =

l
 x = 
l
= 0,
 e

z
e  qa + d ,
= 0,
p =

rl
 

pn =

rl
 n

= in .

(5.1)

from the

equations

(5.1),

fol

lows

that

there

exist primary

constraints

(1)

a = 0,

(1)

a =

(1)

1 = p ,

(1)

2 = pe ,

(1)

3n = pn + in .

(5.2)



we construct the total hamiltonian h (1), according to the standard procedure (we use the

notations of the book [31]), h (1) = h + a(1)

a , where

h =   rl

 q

we get for h:

q  l!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r l

 q =p

,

q = (x, e, , n), p = (p, pe, p, pn) .

h = 

e

2(cid:16)p 2 + 2 pd + 2iqf   m 2(cid:17) + i(cid:18)p  m4 +

1
3

d(cid:19) .

(5.3)

using the consistency conditions: the conservation of the primary constraints (1)

1,2 in time

 , (1)

1,2 =n(1)

1,2, h (1)o = 0, we nd the secondary constraints (2)

1,2 = 0,

(2)
1 = p  m4 +
(2)
2 = p 2 + 2 pd + 2iqf   m 2 = 0 .

d = 0 ,

(5.4)

(5.5)

and the same conditions for the constraints (1)

3n give equations for the determination of 3n.

thus, the hamiltonian h appears to be proportional to constraints, as one can expect in

the case of a reparametrization invariant theory,

h = i(2)

1 

e
2

(2)
2 .

17

no more secondary constraints arise from the dirac procedure, and the lagrange multipliers

1 and 2 remain undetermined, in perfect correspondence with the fact that the number of

gauge transformations parameters equals two for the theory in question. one can go over

from the initial set of constraints (cid:16)(1), (2)(cid:17) to the equivalent one (cid:16)(1), t(cid:17) , where:

t = (2) +

(2)

i
2

r
n

(1)

3n .

(5.6)

the new set of constraints can be explicitly divided in a set of the rst-class constraints,

which is (cid:16)(1)

1,2, t(cid:17) and in a set of the second-class constraints, which is (1)

3n .

now we consider an operator quantization, expecting to get in this procedure the dirac

equation (3.1). to this end we perform only a partial gauge xing, by imposing the supple-

mentary gauge conditions g

1,2 = 0 to the primary rst-class constraints (1)
1,2 ,

g

1 =  = 0, g

2 = e = 1/m ,

(5.7)

which coincide with those we used in the lagrangian analysis. one can check that the con-

ditions of the conservation in time of the supplementary constraints (5.7) give equations for

determination of the multipliers 1 and 2. thus, on this stage we reduced our hamiltonian

theory to one with the rst-class constraints t and second-class ones  =(cid:16)(1), g(cid:17). after

that we will use the so called dirac method for systems with rst-class constraints [30],

which, being generalized to the presence of second-class constraints, can be formulated as

follow: the commutation relations between operators are calculated according to the dirac

brackets with respect to the second-class constraints only; second-class constraints operators

equal zero; rst-class constraints as operators are not zero, but, are considered in sense of

restrictions on state vectors. all the operator equations have to be realized in some hilbert

space.

the sub-set of the second-class constraints(cid:16)(1)

1,2, g(cid:17) has a special form [31], so that one

can use it for eliminating of the variables e, pe, , p, from the consideration, then, for the

rest of the variables x, p, n, the dirac brackets with respect to the constraints  reduce to

18

ones with respect to the constraints (1)

3n only and can be easy calculated,

{x, p}d((1)

3n ) = 
 ,

{n, m}d((1)

3n ) =

i
2

nm ,

while others dirac brackets vanish. thus, the commutation relations for the operators

x, p, n, which correspond to the variables x, p, n respectively, are

[x, p] = i{x, p}d((1)
h m, ni+
= i{m, n}d((1)

3n ) = 
 ,
1
3n ) = 
2

mn.

besides, the operator equations hold:

(1)

3n = pn + i n = 0.

(5.8)

(5.9)

the commutation relations (5.8) and the equations (5.9) can be realized in a space of four

columns (x) dependent on x. at the same time we select x to be operators of multipli-
cation, and p = i,  = i
2 5, where n are the -matrices (, 5).
the rst-class constraints t as operators have to annihilate physical vectors; in virtue of

25, and 4 = i

(5.9), (5.6) these conditions reduce to the equations:

(2)

1,2(x) = 0,

(5.10)

where (2)

1,2 are operators, which correspond to the constraints (5.4), (5.5). there is no
1 , according to the classical function (2)

ambiguity in the construction of the operator (2)

1

from (5.4). thus, taking into account the realizations of the commutation relations (5.8),

one easily can see that the rst equation (5.10) reproduces the dirac equation (3.1). as

to the construction of the operator (2)

2 , according to the classical function (2)

2

from (5.5),

we meet here an ordering problem since the constraint (2)
2

contains terms with products of

the momenta and functions of the coordinates. for such terms we choose the symmetrized

(weyl) form of the corresponding operators, which, in particular, provides the hermiticity

of the operator (2)

2 . but the main reason is, that such a correspondence rule provides the

consistency of the two equations (5.10). indeed, in this case we have

19

(2)

1 (cid:17)2
2 =(cid:16) (2)

,

(5.11)

and the second equation (5.10) appears to be merely the consequence of the rst equation

(5.10), i.e. of the dirac equation (3.1). thus, we see that the operator quantization of

the action reproduces the dirac quantum theory of spinning particle in electromagnetic and

torsion eld.

vi. conclusions

we have constructed (pseudo)classical actions for the spinor and scalar particles in an

external torsion and electromagnetic elds. these actions satisfy some natural conditions:

they are consistent with the renormalizable theory of interacting elds on torsion back-

ground, they manifest standard gauge symmetries, and the low-energy limit ts nicely with

the expressions obtained from the pauli equation. upon quantization, a quantum mechanics

of particles is produced again. in our opinion all that justies the form of the actions. as a

somehow unexpected consequence one meets the nontrivial interaction with torsion for the

scalar particle. this interaction has a nonminimal form and results from the one between

scalar led and background torsion.
