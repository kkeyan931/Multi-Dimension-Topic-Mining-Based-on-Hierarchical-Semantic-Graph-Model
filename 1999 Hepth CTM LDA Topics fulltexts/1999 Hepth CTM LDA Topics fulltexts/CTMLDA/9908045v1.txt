abstract

the nature of -symmmetry transformations is examined for p-branes
embedded in a class of coset superspaces g/h, where g is an appropriate
supergroup and h is the lorentz subgroup. it is shown that one of the condi-
tions z m em
a which characterizes -symmetry transformations arises very
naturally if they are implemented in terms of a right action of a subgroup
of the supergroup g on the supergroup elements which represent the coset.
unlike the global left action of g on g/h (which gives rise to supersym-
metry on the coset superspace), there is no canonically dened right action
of g on g/h. however, an interpretation of this right action involving an
enlargement of the isotropy group from the lorentz subgroup to a subgroup
of g with generators which include some of the fermionic generators of g is
suggested. closure of the generators of this larger subgroup under commuta-
tion leads to the usual brane scan for p-branes which have bosonic degrees
of freedom which are worldvolume scalars.

1 introduction

kappa symmetry is a local fermionic symmetry of covariant green-schwarz
actions [1] for p-branes. discovered in the context the superparticle action
[2], its presence ensures that only half of the supersymmetry generators are
realized nonlinearly, as required for low energy eective actions describing
the long wavelength excitations of bps solitons [3, 4]. the standard proce-
dure for forming -symmetric green-schwarz actions in at superspace is the
nonlinear sigma model approach [5]. the kinetic term is a natural general-
ization of the nambu action, to which is added a wess-zumino term formed
by integrating a closed form in superspace over an embedded manifold whose
boundary is the worldvolume of the p-brane2. global supersymmetry of the
action is ensured by constructing both pieces of the action in terms of the
vielbein on at superspace. the -symmetry is then a eld dependent lo-
cal fermionic transformation for which the variations of the the kinetic term
and the wess-zumino term can be made to cancel by appropriate choice of
the normalization of the wess-zumino term. this procedure has recently
been extended to the case of superspace backgrounds which are more general
cosets than at superspace [6].

progress has been made in achieving a geometric understanding of kappa
symmetry using the formalism of super-embeddings [7] (for a recent review
of this approach including a comprehensive list of references, see [8]). the
worldvolume of the p-brane is extended to a supermanifold which is embed-
ded into the target superspace in such a way that the odd subspace of the
worldvolume tangent space is a subset of the odd subspace of tangent space to
the target superspace. in such a formulation, the fermionic kappa symmetry
can be related to the worldvolume supersymmetry.

it has been noted in the past that in at superspace, the -symmetry
transformation of the bosonic superspace coordinate is like a wrong-signed
supersymmetry transformation [9]. in terms of the construction of at su-
perspace as the coset g/h of the super-poincare group g with the lorentz
subgroup as the isotropy group h [10], and in which supersymmetry transfor-
mations of the superspace coordinates are achieved by the canonically dened
left action of the superalgebra on the coset superspace, this is an indication
that -symmetry transformations should be related to the right action of

2only p-branes which have bosonic degrees of freedom which are worldvolume scalars

will be considered in this paper.

the superalgebra on the same coset. in the hamiltonian formulation for p-
branes embedded in at superspace, de azcarraga, izquierdo and townsend
[11] showed that the fermionic constraints (some of which are rst class,
corresponding to the existence of local -symmetry) are analogous to super-
covariant derivatives in superspace, which generate right supertranslations.
since left and right supertranslations commute, this provides a means to im-
plement fermionic constraints which are consistent with the global supersym-
metry generated by left supertranslations. more recently bars, deliduman
and minic [12] have implemented -symmetry transformations for a number
of non-at coset superspaces in terms of a local right action.

the aim of this paper is to point out that for a general class of coset
superspaces, -symmetry transformations do indeed have a natural interpre-
tation in terms of a local right action, as opposed to the global left action
which gives rise to the supersymmetry. in particular, after a review of the
relevant properties of coset spaces in 2 and a discussion of relevant coset
superspaces in the rst part of 3, it will be shown that the criterion

z m em

a = 0

which characterizes -symmetry transformations in curved superspace [13,
14] is very naturally implemented for coset superspaces g/h in terms of a
local right action of a part of the supergroup g. although only the left ac-
tion of the supergroup g on the coset superspace g/h is canonically dened
(this is the usual nonlinear realization of g on g/h, which is independent of
a particular parameterization of the coset), it is argued that the local right
action associated with the -symmetry transformations is also well-dened,
and should be interpreted as giving rise to an enlargement of the isotropy
group h from the lorentz subgroup to a larger subgroup h which includes
fermionic generators. this is consistent with the role of -symmetry in co-
variant green-schwarz actions, which is to ensure that although there appear
to be goldstone fermions associated with all the supersymmetry generators,
in fact only half of them are physical, meaning that only half of the super-
symmetry is realized nonlinearly, with the rest of the supersymmetry being
realized linearly on the physical degrees of freedom.
in 4, this interpre-
tation is expanded to include the worldvolume dieomorphisms, which also
eliminate some of the apparent goldstone degrees of freedom in covariant
green-schwarz actions. it is argued in 5 that consistency of this picture re-
quires that the generators of the right actions associated with the -symmetry
transformations and the worldvolume dieomorphisms must form a closed

2

superalgebra, from which emerge the usual restrictions on relationship be-
tween the dimension of the worldvolume of a p-brane and the dimension of
the spacetime into which it is embedded (the brane-scan [15]).

2 some preliminaries

we begin by reviewing relevant details of coset spaces and nonlinear realiza-
tions. consider a lie algebra g with generators ta satisfying the (possibly
graded) commutation relations

[ta, tb] = ifab

c tc.

let ti denote the generators of a subalgebra h of g (the unbroken gener-
ators), and ta denote the remaining generators of g (the broken genera-
tors), and assume that the ta provide a representation of h under commu-
tation. a slice through g locally isomorphic to g/h can be parameterized
in the form

g(z) = exp(iz m m

ata),

(1)

with the z m furnishing local coordinates on g/h. there is a canonical global
left action of g on g/h under which the point with coordinates z is mapped
by xed g  g into the point with coordinates z  determined by

g.g(z) = g(z ).h(z, g).

(2)

here, h(z, g) is the compensating h-transformation required to bring g.g(z)
back onto the slice (1) isomorphic to g/h. the realization of the group g
on the coordinates z is nonlinear.

the cartan one-form g(z)1dg(z) dened on g/h takes values in the

complexication of the lie algebra of g and can be decomposed as

g(z)1dg(z) = i dz m em

a(z) ta + i dz m m

i(z) ti.

(3)

these forms are invariant the global action left action of g on g/h since
d(g.g(z)) = g.dg(z) if g is constant. under the local right action g(z) 
g(z).h(z) with h(z) = eii (z)ti  h, the forms ea(z) = dz m em
a(z)
transform as a vielbein on the tangent bundle to g/h, while i(z) =
dz m m
i(z) transforms as a connection on this bundle (see, for example,

3

[16]). the maurer cartan equations 0 = d(g(z)1dg(z)) + g(z)1dg(z) 
g(z)1dg(z) can be written in the form

1
ec(z)  eb(z)fbc

2
1
ec(z)  eb(z)fbc

a = dea(z) + i(z)  eb(z)fbi
k(z)  j (z)fj k
i = di(z) +

a

i,

(4)

so that the left-hand sides of these expressions are respectively the torsion
and curvature of the coset space.

replacing d by  in (3), an innitesimal variation z m of the coordinate
z m on g/h will induce a variation g(z) of the representative group element
g(z) which satises

g(z)1g(z) = i z m em

a(z) ta + i z m m

i(z) ti.

(5)

consider now the right action of the group g on the representatives3 g(z)

of the points in the coset g/h. in particular, consider
g(z)  g(z).ei(va(z)ta+wi (z)ti ).

since the new group element will lie on the h-orbit of some point on the
slice, one has

g(z).ei(va(z)ta+wi (z)ti ) = g(z ).h(v, w, z)
for some h(v, w, z)  h. in innitesimal form one obtains

g(z ) = g(z).(cid:16)1 + iva(z)ta + iwi(z)ti)(cid:17) .(cid:16)1  ii(v, w, z)ti(cid:17) ,

where i(v, w, z) is linear in va(z) and wi(z). this yields

g(z)1g(z) = iva(z)ta + i(wi(z)  i(v, w, z) ti.

comparing (5) and (7),

va(z) = z m em

a(z)

which allows z m to be computed given va(z). the remaining relation

i(z) = wi(z)  i(v, w, z)
determines the compensating lorentz transformation i.

unlike the case of the left action of the group. the right action considered here is dependent
on the choice of the slice g(z).

3 coset superspaces

the analysis of -symmetric green-schwarz actions for p-branes in an generic
ten or eleven dimensional superspace backgrounds [14, 18] is complicated by
the fact that there is no general prescription for the construction of the su-
perelds which correspond to a given bosonic background [17]. however, the
fact that at superspaces can be considered as cosets of the super-poincare
group with the lorentz subgroup as the stability group [19] allows a geomet-
ric formulation of the green-schwarz action in terms of a nonlinear sigma
model on the coset space [5, 4, 20]. recently, this construction has been
extended to the case of superspaces whose bosonic parts correspond to the
near horizon geometries of various p-brane solitons, which are of the form
adsp+2  sdp2. the corresponding superspaces can be realized as coset
spaces g/h for some choice of supergroup g and bosonic stability group h,
particular cases of interest being

ads5  s5 = su(2, 2|4)/ (so(1, 4)  so(5))
ads4  s7 = osp(8|4)/ (so(1, 3)  so(7))
ads7  s4 = osp(6, 2|4)/ (so(1, 6)  so(4)) .

(10)

these correspond respectively to the d3 brane in d = 10 iib supergravity
[6], the m2 brane in d = 11 supergravity, and the m5 brane in d = 11
supergravity [21, 22].

the coset superspaces g/h above are based on supergroups g with gen-
erators which will be denoted pa, q and jab. the jab are generators of a
lorentz subgroup h, under which the even generators pa transform as a
vector and the odd generators q transform as spinors:

[jab, pc] =

[jab, q] =

i
2 (cid:16)ac b
i
[a, b]
8

d  bc a
 q.

d(cid:17) pd

(11)

the remaining (anti)commutation relations for the lie algebra of the su-
pergroup g will not be specied, except to require that the algebra has a
contraction to the usual (possibly extended) supersymmetry algebra, as a
result of which the anticommutator of odd generators takes the form

{q, q} = 2(ca) pa + if

abjab.

(12)

g(z) = ei(xmm

apa+q)  eizm m

ata,

this structure encompasses the super-poincare group appropriate to the con-
struction of at superspaces, as well as the more general supergroups in the
coset superspaces (10). the coset superspaces can be parameterized in the
form

where z m = (xm, ), and ta = (pa, q) are the broken generators.

evidence is now provided for the identication of the -symmetries of the
green-schwarz actions in these coset superspaces g/h with a right action4
of the the supergroup g. the canonically dened global action of an element
g  g on the coset superspace is determined the left action g.g(z), as in (2).
a green-schwarz action is automatically invariant under this group action
since it is constructed from the cartan forms g(z)1dg(z). consider instead
the local transformation

g(z)  g(z ) = g(z) eiva(z)ta eiab(v,z)jab,

with vata = vapa + vq. as noted earlier, the right action of the group
on representative of cosets does not descend to a canonically dened trans-
formation on g/h : the transformation z  z (z) determined by (6) is
dependent on the choice of slice g(z). in innitesimal form, the relationship
between va(z) and z = z   z is given by (8),
a(z),

va(z) = z m em

where em
0 corresponds to the condition

a(z) is the vielbein on the coset superspace. thus, setting va(z) =

0 = z m em

a(z).

this is one of the criteria which characterize a -transformation on the
worldvolume of a p-brane embedded in a curved superspace [13, 14]. it de-
termines the transformation xm of the even superspace coordinates of the
embedded worldvolume in terms of , the variation of the odd coordinates.
a(z) vanishes is naturally implemented in
terms of a local right action depending only on the fermionic generators of

so the condition that z m em

a lagrangian, and once in the context of transformations on a group manifold generated
by the group structure; in future use of this term, it should be clear from the context
which of these is applicable.

the supergroup5. as there is no canonically dened right action of g on g/h,
the implementation of a -transformation in the above fashion would seem
to depend on the parameterization of the coset superspace. however, this is
not true provided the right action is a local symmetry ; it is then a reection
of the presence of unphysical degrees of freedom which can be eliminated by
a choice of gauge for the local symmetry.

the latter principle is well known in the standard construction of a sigma
model with a target space which is a coset space. generically, one starts with
an action of the form

s = z dx (g1mg)a (g1mg)b ab

where g(x) = expi(a(x)ta+i(x)ti)  g, with ti the generators of h, and where
ab is a h-invariant metric. the sigma model possess a local symmetry under
the right action of h since (g1mg)a transforms linearly under such trans-
formations (assuming the generators ta provide a representation of h under
commutation with the ti). this gauge symmetry can be xed by setting i
to zero, giving a parameterization of g/h in a physical gauge in terms of the
slice g() = expiata . since it is constructed from the cartan form g1dg, the
action s also has a global symmetry under the left action of g. in particular,
the subgroup h is realized linearly on the physical degrees of freedom a,
while the rest of the generators of g are realized nonlinearly. even in the
physical gauge, there is still a symmetry under the local right action of h.

in the case of p-brane actions in coset superspaces g/h, a local symmetry
under the right action of a lorentz subgroup h has been xed in choosing a
apa+q). if the
slice g(z) which is parameterized in the form g(z) = ei(xmm
wess-zumino term is appropriately normalized, then the action possesses a
-symmetry, which, as argued above, takes the form of a local right action
generated by a subset of the supersymmetry generators. although this right
action is not well-dened on g/h, it suggests that the theory really describes
degrees of freedom on a smaller coset space g/ h, where h  h includes an
appropriate subset of the fermionic generators. in this case the right action
is well-dened, independent of the parameterization of g/h with which the
construction starts. further, under the left action of g, the fermionic gener-

5of course, there are additional criteria which a -symmetry transformation must ful-
ll; these will be discussed in the following sections. in particular, only a subset of the
supersymmetry generators is involved in a -symmetry transformation, and this subset
depends on the point on the embedded worldvolume.

ators in h will be realized linearly on the physical degrees of freedom, while
the remaining fermionic generators will still be nonlinearly realized. this is
precisely the requirement for the eective action describing the low energy
excitations of a bps state which preserves only half the supersymmetry. it
is this interpretation of -symmetry which we wish to pursue. it should be
pointed out that the situation is actually more subtle, because the subgroup
h varies from point to point of the embedded worldvolume.

4 incorporating worldvolume dieomorphisms

p-brane actions are by construction also invariant under worldvolume dif-
feomorphisms. this ensures that there are only physical goldstone modes
corresponding to the generators pa of superspace translations which are bro-
ken by the embedding of the p-brane into superspace. the unphysical bosonic
goldstone degrees of freedom in the covariant green-schwarz action can be
eliminated by a choice of gauge for the worldvolume dieomorphisms. since
symmetry with respect to the worldvolume dieomorphisms performs the
same role as the -symmetry transformations, namely the elimination of un-
physical goldstone degrees of freedom, then if the above interpretation of
the -symmetry transformations as enlarging the isotropy group in the con-
struction of the coset superspace is correct, the worldvolume dieomorphisms
should also have an interpretation in terms of the local right action of a sub-
group of the supergroup g on the coset superspace g/h. this is indeed the
case, as we now demonstrate.

if z m () denotes the embedding of the (p + 1)-dimensional worldvol-
ume (with coordinates i) of a p-brane into the coset superspace, then since
the spacetime coordinates are worldvolume scalars, they transform under
an innitesimal worldvolume dieomorphism generated by the worldvolume
vector eld vi() 

i as

vz m () = vi()

z m ()

i

.

using (8) and (9), such a transformation of the spacetime coordinates is
induced by a right action of the form

g(z())  g(z ()) = g(z()) eiva()ta+iwab()jab eiab()jab

it is possible to choose wab() so that the compensating transformation van-
ishes, namely wab() = vi() zm ()
ab(z()). in this case the dieomor-
phism is generated in the form

mentation of dieomorphisms in superspaces in terms of so-called supergauge
transformations [23].

to check this, computing g(z )

(upon use of the expressions (4) for the torsion and curvature of a coset
superspace) the correct transformations

5 the algebra of -transformations and dif-

feomorphisms

both the -symmetry transformations and the dieomorphisms are local
symmetries which remove unphysical goldstone degrees of freedom from the
covariant green-schwarz action for a p-brane propagating in a coset super-
space g/h, leaving physical goldstone modes only for those generators of
the supergroup g which are broken by the embedding of the p-brane in su-
perspace. in the left action of g on g/h, the broken generators are realized
nonlinearly on the physical degrees of freedom, while the unbroken genera-
tors are realized linearly. as already mentioned, this is naturally achieved if

9

the -symmetry transformations and the dieomorphisms arise from a local
right action of special linear combinations of the generators of the super-
group g on the coset superspace representatives g(z()); however, for this
picture to be consistent, these linear combinations of generators must close
under commutation and so generate a subgroup of the supergroup. this will
then have the eect of enlarging the isotropy group of the coset superspace
to a subgroup h which contains these linear combinations of generators in
addition to the lorentz generators. the subgroup h varies from point to
point on the embedded worldvolume.

it has already been demonstrated in a general context that both the -
symmetry transformations and the dieomorphisms can indeed be realized in
terms of a local right action. it thus remains to show that the corresponding
generators form a subalgebra of the full superalgebra g. in other words, it is
necessary to show that the generators of -symmetry transformations, world-
volume dieomorphisms and lorentz transformations form a closed algebra
under commutation if the above interpretation of these transformations as
local right actions is to be consistent.

before calculating the appropriate commutators, the form of -symmetry
transformations must be fully specied. they involve the pullback to the
worldvolume of various structures on the coset superspace. these include
the worldvolume metric, which is the pullback of the lorentz invariant metric

the -symmetry transformations for a p-brane embedded in at super-

is necessary if -symmetry transformations are to take this form. alterna-
tively, by the same method used in the case of dieomorphisms, it is possible
to implement the -symmetry transformation in such a manner that a com-
pensating lorentz transformation is not necessary, in which case the right

in the appendix, it is shown that for innitesimal worldvolume dieo-
morphisms and -symmetry transformations, dened in terms of the right
actions (13) and (17), the following commutation relations hold:

the commutation relations (18) are valid independent of the dimension
of the spacetime formed by the coset superspace into which the p-brane is
embedded. however, this is not true for the commutator [1, 2] of a pair of
-symmetry transformations. as shown in the appendix, such a commutator
yields a linear combination of a dieomorphism (parameterized by the world-
volume vector eld vi = 2i(2p+ip1)), a lorentz transformation and
another -symmetry transformation7 if the following conditions are satised:
(i) the dimension of the spacetime into which the p-brane is em-

bedded is such that the gamma matrix identities

for p = 1 and

0 = (ca)( (ca))

0 = (ca1)( (ca1a2ap))

for p > 1 are true (the round brackets on spinor indices denote symmetriza-
tion). this yields the usual brane scan for p-branes whose bosonic degrees
of freedom are worldsheet scalars [15].

(ii) for p > 1, the additional condition 0 = (pi)

 must also

be satised.
condition (ii) is one of the equations of motion for a p-brane, namely that
which follows from

s = z d(p+1) det g (z m )em

(19)

7the calculation in the appendix does not give the explicit form of the lorentz trans-
formation and the -symmetry transformation, although these could be extracted with a
little more eort. also note that conditions (i) and (ii) are only shown to be sucient
rather than necessary conditions for the algebra to close.

 of the p-brane action s. this is consistent with
under a variation (z m )em
 = (p+c 1). in fact, (19)
the existence of a -symmetry form (z m )em
can be taken as a denition of the p-brane action [24], in that integrating
this gives the usual p-brane action (with the kinetic term coming from the
piece in p proportional to 1 and the wess-zumino term coming from the
piece in p proportional to ). so except for p = 1 (a string), the algebra
of dieomorphisms and -symmetry transformations closes only on-shell. it
is interesting that requiring the algebra of the -symmetry transformations,
worldvolume dieomorphisms and lorentz transformations to close on itself
yields a condition which can be used to construct the p-brane action.

6 conclusion

the suggestion [9, 11, 12] that -symmetry transformations are related to
the right action of the supergroup g on a coset superspace g/h has been
examined for a special class of coset superspaces which are currently of in-
terest in studies of p-branes propagating in curved spacetimes. it has been
shown that the condition

z m em

a

which is accepted as one of the hallmarks of a -symmetry transformation
for p-branes embedded in curved superspaces [13, 14] arises very naturally
if the -symmetry transformation is implemented in terms of a right ac-
tion of the supergroup g on g/h. further, a physical interpretation of this
right action in terms of an enlargement of the isotropy subgroup from the
lorentz subgroup of g has been suggested. this is consistent with the role of
both worldvolume dieomorphisms and -symmetry transformations in co-
variant green-schwarz p-brane actions, namely in the elimination of unphysi-
cal goldstone degrees of freedom. requiring that the algebra of worldvolume
dieomorphisms, -symmetry transformations and lorentz transformations
closes on itself at each point of the embedded worldvolume leads to the usual
brane scan for p-branes with worldvolume degrees of freedom which are
scalars [15]. in the case p > 1, closure of the algebra also requires that one
of the usual equations of motion for a p-brane be true. it was pointed out
that this condition can in fact be used to reconstruct the p-brane action.

it is interesting to speculate on the relationship of the approach in this pa-
per to the original formulation of the brane scane in terms of the existence
of suitable closed dierential forms in the embedding superspace from which

13

the wess-zumino term in the covariant green-schwarz p-brane action can be
constructed [15]. the closure of the algebra of worldvolume dieomorphisms,
-symmetry transformations and lorentz transformations corresponds to an
integrability condition on certain vector elds, and this usually has a dual
formulation in terms of dierential forms. the results of this paper are pre-
sumably also closely related to the geometric interpretation of -symmetry
transformations in terms of superembeddings [7, 8].

appendix

in this appendix, the conditions under which the generators of dieomor-
phisms and -symmetry transformations form a closed algebra under com-
mutation are examined.

consider rst the dieomorphisms, generated by the right action (13).
the generator of dieomorphisms depends on the point z() on the em-
ab(z()) (the
bedded worldvolume through the presence of ei
latter vanishes in at superspace). thus, if a pair of dieomorphisms are
successively applied, the generator of the second dioemorphism depends on
the point z  resulting from the rst dieomorphism:

a(z()) and i

g(z)  g(z) eivi

1()(ei

a(z)ta+i

ab(z)jab) eivj

2()(ej

b (z )tb +j

cd(z )jcd).

for innitesimal dieomorphisms, the arguments of the exponentials can be
combined as

i(v1 + v2)i (ei

ata + i

abjab)

[ivi

abjab), ivj

2 (ej

btb + j

cdjcd)]

+

+ivj

2 (v1ej

btb + v1j

cdjcd).

if the dieomorphisms are performed in reverse order, the same expression
with 1 and 2 interchanged results. the commutator of a pair of dieomor-
phisms is the dierence of these expressions. using the result (14) and the
expression (4) for the torsion and curvature of the coset superspace, one nds

[v1, v2] = v3

with vi

2(jvi

in checking the commutator of a dieomorphism and a -symmetry trans-
formation, the variations of the pulled back vielbein and connection are re-
quired:

where (p+c 1em ) = (p+c 1)e
m , and where all transformations are
evaluated at a point z() on the the embedded worldvolume. the results
(20) are obtained by computing g(z )1 
i g(z ) with g(z ) given by (17).
also required is the -symmetry transformation of the projection operator

bb, and a sum over a is thus a restriction
here, a is shorthand for (1  k)a
to a sum over the spacetime vector degrees of freedom which are transverse
to the worldvolume. in computing p+, it is necessary to use the fact that
bkb

a = iei

a anticommutes with c(1  k)c

as with the commutator of a pair of dieomorphisms, in computing the
commutator of a dieomorphism and a -symmetry transformation, the sec-
ond transformation acts at a transformed point, and one nds

by computing g(z )ig(z ) with g(z ) given by (17), the rst three terms in
this expression are easily shown to be

combining this with the fact that v = vii for worldvolume scalars yields

the only dicult step in computing the algebra of right transformations

computing the commutator and collecting all the terms proportional to jab

where the  in the rst term applies to p even/odd, and we have used
(cp+)t = cp for p even/odd. in fact,

so the rst term becomes

2(2p+ip1)ei

which is part of the generator of a dieomorphism with parameter vi =
2i(2p+ip1). completing the generator of the dieomorphism,

the third and fourth terms on the right-hand side cancel against the m
dependent pieces of the last two terms, which are obtained from (20) and (21).
to show that the remaining q dependent terms constitute a -symmetry

ab

transformation, it is only necessary to show that the pieces proportional to
pq vanish, as a -symmetry transformation is generated by ip+q (plus
a piece which can be absorbed into a lorentz transformation) and so only
involves p+q. thus it suces to prove

0 = 2(2p+ip1)( eipq) + (1p+aei)(2aipq)

(2p+aei)(1aipq).

the sums over the restricted range a in the last terms (i.e. over spacetime
vector indices transverse to the worldvolume, see after equation (21)) can be
replaced by unrestricted sums by inclusion of appropriate projection opera-
tors, and the required identity is

0 = 2(
(

2 i

(22)

where  = p and the upper sign in a given term in (22) refers to the case
p even, while the lower sign refers to the case p odd. the distinction between
p even and p odd arises because for p even

while for p odd,

pip = 0, pap = 0,

pip = 0, pap = 0.

for the case p = 1, (22) is easily shown to be true if the spacetime gamma

matrix identity

(ca)( (ca))

applies (where the round brackets denote the totally symmetric piece). the
gamma matrix identity is applied to the second term, and use must be made
of the fact that

(

i jiq) = (

2 j

1 )gij(e+

i q) + (

2 i

via the p = 1 version of the identities

i  = i[ p+1

[i, j]  = i[ p+1

i j i2ip i2    ip.

(23)

(p  1)!det g

for the case p > 1, the situation is a little more complicated. the identity
(22) can be proved in spacetime dimensions for which the gamma matrix
identity

0 = (ca1)( (ca1a2ap))

is true, where a1a2ap is the totally antisymmetric product of p gamma
matrices. to apply the gamma matrix identity, we write

(

i )(

2 aiq) = i[ p+1
2 ]

1

i i1ip

p! det g
i )(

1 ae

(

2 a i1ip1 ipq).

if, in addition, the condition

0 = (piei) = (ie

i )

(24)

is satised, then the gamma matrix identity (after use of (23)) yields

0 = (

1 ae

i )(

2 aiq)

(

2 i

this is the required result (22). note that the identity (22) is not true if the
condition is not enforced (24), as otherwise there remain terms containing
(ie

i ) which do not cancel against each other.
