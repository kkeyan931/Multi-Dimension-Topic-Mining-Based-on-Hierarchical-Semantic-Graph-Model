abstract

we study the solutions of the einstein equations in (d + 2)-dimensions, describing
parallel p-branes (p = d1) in a space with two transverse dimensions of positive gaussian
curvature. these solutions generalize the solutions of deser and jackiw of point particle
sources in (2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with cosmological constant. determination of the
metric is reduced to nding the roots of a simple algebraic equation. these roots also
determine the nontrivial warp factors of the metric at the positions of the branes. we
discuss the possible role of these solutions and the importance of warp factors in the
context of the large extra dimensions scenario.

1 introduction and summary.

we study solutions of the einstein equations of d + 2 dimensional gravity with a cosmological
constant. the solutions represent (d 1)-branes embedded in a space with two compact trans-
verse dimensions with a positive curvature. they generalize the static solutions of deser and
jackiw [1], describing point particles in 2 + 1 dimensional gravity with cosmological constant,
to the case of extended objects.

the solutions we nd obey einsteins equations, as well as the equation of motion of the
branes (the geodesic equation). it is remarkable that the metric, in appropriate coordinates,
can be found without explicitly solving the einstein equations. analyzing the properties of the
solutions is reduced to nding the roots of a simple algebraic equation.

from the point of view of applications to the recently proposed [2], [3] large extra dimensions
scenario, the most important property of our solutions is that they are characterized by non-
trivial warp factors that aect the values of the parameters of the world-volume theories [4].
in particular, the usual relation between the four dimensional planck scale, the 6 dimensional
fundamental scale of gravity, and the volume of the compactied space is aected by the
presence of the warp factors. this dierence can be important if the warp factors signicantly
deviate from unity (which, in the present framework can only be achieved by ne tuning various
parameters) (for related papers with one transverse dimension, see [5]).

this paper is structured as follows.

while our recipe for nding solutions is rather general, motivated by the large extra dimen-
sions proposal, we discuss in some detail the solution that describes two 3-branes embedded in
six dimensional space time with negative#1 (de sitter) cosmological constant. the two branes
are located on the north and south poles of a sphere, with a wedge cut out, due to the
decit angle characteristic of pointlike sources in 2 dimensions. an important property of the
solution is that the metric on the branes is not at, but rather de sitter. while the cosmo-
logical constant and the strength of gravity on the visible brane can be tuned to satisfy the
experimental constraints, within our ansatz there is no solution with at world volume metric.
in section 2, we present the ansatz and derive the
equations of motion. we show that they reduce to a simple dierential equation in one real
variable, similar to the case considered by deser and jackiw [1]. in section 3, we give a general
analysis of the solutions. we show that the form of the metric (in appropriate coordinates)
as well as the interpretation of its singularities can be obtained without explicitly solving the
dierential equation. all information on the solution can be deduced by nding the appropriate
roots of an algebraic equation.
in particular, these roots determine the values of the warp
factors on the branes. we derive expressions for the strength of the gravitational coupling, the
cosmological constant on the various branes, and the size of the transverse space. finally, in
section 4, we discuss an explicit example, with d = 4, which is of interest to the large extra
dimension scenario. we show that the parameters allow ne tuning of the planck scale and
cosmological constant to values that do not contradict the observed ones.

#1we note that our conventions for the signs of the curvature are those of [6]; in addition  < 0 in (1)

corresponds to de sitter space.

2 the ansatz and equations of motion.

the action we consider is that of gravity in d = d + 2 dimensions, with the usual einstein
action with cosmological term included:

sgravity = m d2z ddyg (r  2) .

(1)

the indices m, n = 1, ..., d, while ,  = 0, ..., d = d  2 and i, j = 1, 2 span the rest of the
space; the metric has signature (, +, . . . , +). the vacuum einstein equations follow from the
variation of the gravity action:

sgravity = m d2z ddyg(cid:18)rm n +

1
2

gm n r  gm n (cid:19) gm n = 0 .

(2)

the matter is in the form of d  1 dimensional branes, whose action is proportional to the
area of the world surface they sweep in the d + 2 dimensional spacetime:

smatter = xa

f d

a z ddyz dd d(y  xa()) qg,

(3)

where x m
a () is the embedding of the world surface in space time (a runs over the various
branes) and g = x m
, gm n (y) the induced metric and g   det g (hereafter we will
omit the sum over the various sources, it will be implicit in all our formulae). the matter
energy momentum tensor is dened by:

, x n

smatter =

(5)

hence

the equation of motion of the branes (obtained by varying the action with respect to the brane
coordinates x()) is the geodesic equation:

, x l

where 2 = g1/2g1/2g is the covariant dalembertian in the induced metric.
coordinates transverse to the branes (denoted by xi, i = 1, 2):

our ansatz for the metric includes a nontrivial warp factor e2, depending only on the

ds2 = e2(xi)hg(x)dxdx + e2k(xi)dxidxii .

we assume that the d-dimensional metric g(x) obeys the equation

r

gr + g = 0 ,

(8)

so that  becomes a parameter of our solution.

the idea for nding a solution with delta-function sources is to rst solve the source-free
equations of motion. then, admitting delta function like curvature singularities of the metric
will allow us to include the eect of the sources. following this strategy, in the remainder of
this section we consider the source free equations.

the einstein equation following from the variation of the action with respect to the , 

components of the metric is:

d,ii + k,ii +

d(d  1)

2

,i,i = e2+2k  e2k

(9)

this equation, away from the singularities, is a consequence of the other equations of motion.
static sources will lead to delta-function singularities on the r.h.s. of equation (9). these will
appear, as we will show in section 3, because of singularites of k,ii.

the (trace of) the variation of the action w.r.t. the i, j components of the metric gives the

following equation:

  + d   =

2
d

e2+2k 

e2k .

(10)

d  2

we have introduced complex coordinates, z = (x1 + ix2)/2, z = (x1  ix2)/2, and dened
 = x1  ix2,  = x1 + ix2 such that z = 1,  z = 0. on the other hand, the traceless
part of the equations of motion that follow from varying the action with respect to the i, j
components of the metric are nothing but the cauchy-riemann conditions for the function

v = e2k   .

(11)

the function v , therefore is holomorphic, v = 0. this fact will play a central role in our
ability to nd explicit solutions.#2

we can now further simplify our equations, following [1]. multiplying (10) by v given by

(11) and using v = 0, we obtain after integrating over z,

v ed =

2

d + 1

e(d+1) 

2d

(d  2)(d  1)

e(d1) + (z) ,

where (z) is an integration constant. upon introducing the new complex variable

 = z z dw

v (w)

(12)

(13)

#2before continuing with the analysis of solutions with nontrivial warp factors, we note that the source-free
equations of motion (10,11) admit a simple solution with k =  log(1 + 4|z|2/2), and  = const., provided the
values of  and  are related, so that the r.h.s. of (10) vanishes. these solutions are of the form dsd2  s2,
with the radius of s2, , and the cosmological constant of the dsd2, , related by (10):  = 22(d  2),
 = 22d (for  = 0). these vacuum solutions of the d + 2 dimensional einstein equations with cosmological
constant generalize the nariai solutions [7] to d + 2 dimensions. we thank n. kaloper for pointing out to us
the existence of ref. [7].

as well as denoting e = n, we can rewrite the equation as:




n d =

2

d + 1

n d+1 

2d

(d  2)(d  1)

n d1 +  .

(14)

now upon taking the complex conjugate equation, we see that the reality condition for n
implies that n is a function of the real part of  only and that  must be a real constant.
finally, introduce the variable

t =

2

(d + 1)d

( +  ) =

2

(d + 1)d  z z dw

v (w)

+ h.c.!

and write the equation in terms of the single real variable t (15):

f (n) dn 

n d1
p (n)

dn = dt ,

where f (n) is dened by the rst equality, and the polynomial p (n) is:

with the coecients a, b dened as follows:

p (n) = n d+1  an d1 + b ,

a =




d(d + 1)

(d  2)(d  1)

(17)

(18)

this completes our discussion of the equations of motion. we saw that the equation of
motion for the ansatz (7) reduced to a simple dierential equation in one real variable (16);
a general solution can be expressed in terms of the general solution of this equation and a
holomorphic function v (11). we also note that this provides also a solution to eq. (9)it is
easy to see that (10) together with the holomorphicity of v implies (9), away from possible
singularities (which, as we will see in the next section, appear in k,ii).

in the following section we present a general analysis of the solutions of (16).

3 general analysis of the solutions.

in this section, we discuss the properties of the general solution of the equation (16). to begin,
we need to specify the range of the variable t in (16). in the cases of interest to us t will span
the entire real axisconsider e.g. the case v (z) = z/c, so that t  log |z|. in order to solve
(16) we need to nd a function f (n) such that f (n) = f (n). moreover, we should be able
to invert f (n) for all values of tthen n(t) = f 1(t) will satisfy (16).

even though the equation is rather complicated and the explicit form of f (n) is generally
unknown, we will see that the quantities of interest of us do not require an explicit knowledge
of the solution. in fact, the metric can, in appropriate coordinates, be expressed in terms of
the polynomial p (n), while the ranges of the variables are determined by appropriately chosen
roots of the polynomial p (n).

4

the basic requirement is that we nd a function f (n) which monotonically changes from
 to  over some nite range of values of n. for that to be the case, the function f (n)
has to have the properties (recall that f  = f ) that between two values of n a) it does not
change sign and b) its modulus approaches innity at the two boundary values of n. consider
two nearest neighbor roots of the polynomial p (n), n1 and n2. assume that both n1 and
n2 have the same sign.#3 now, at the roots of p (n) f (n) blows up; moreover, if n1 and
n2 have the same sign, f (n) does not change sign as n varies between n1 and n2 (we are
mostly interested in the case of even d). then, between these two roots f (n) is monotonic
and approaches  at one of the roots, say n1, and  at the other root, n2. hence, we can
invert the equation (16) and nd the function n(t) = f 1(t) for all values of t on the real
axis; moreover, the function n(t) approaches nite valuesthe roots of p (n), n1 and n2as
|t|  .
thus the problem of nding a solution of (16) is reduced to nding the condition that there
are two real nearest-neighbor roots of p (n) of the same sign. it is easily seen, e.g. for d = 4,
that this requires that a > 0, i.e.  and  have the same sign.

we assume now that the parameters a, b (18) are such that two such roots, n1 and n2 are
found (assume for simplicity that they are both positive). let us now analyze the properties
of the solution. the metric has the form (7); having found the function n(t), we can now
determine the n 2e2k factor in the metric by using (11) and the equation (16):

n 2e2k =

v

n =

d(d + 1)

dt =

d(d + 1) " dz

we can rewrite the metric (7) as:

finally, we can change variables from t to n using (16) and write the metric as:

ds2 = n 2ds2

d(d + 1)

(23)

where n now varies between the two roots, n1 and n2 of p (n). the region of variation of
the angle  depends on the precise form of v (z) and the choice of coecient ;  in (20) is an
arbitrary constant that can be reabsorbed in redenition of .#4

clearly the metric (23) has singularities at n = n1, n2. to nd what these singularities
imply for the physical interpretation of the solution, it is convenient to consider again the metric
in the form (21), (19). clearly the zeros of v (z) are singular points of the metric. under the
map z  t (20) these zeros are mapped to t = , which, nally, are mapped to the roots of
the polynomial p (n), n1,2.
now recall that the geodesic equationthe equation of motion of the branes (6) has also to
be obeyed (for example, if this equation is not obeyed, an initially static brane will accelerate).
in the static gauge, x  = , x i
 g = 0 at the positions of
the branes (note that in the static gauge the induced metric is equal to the the metric of the
embedding space restricted to the brane). for our ansatz (7) the geodesic equation in the static
gauge amounts to the condition

, = 0, (6) implies that gi

e(d2)2k ,i = 0  n d1v = 0 ,

(24)

which should hold at the positions of the branes. the positions of the branes, therefore,
correspond to zeros of the holomorphic function v (11), and hence to n1,2 in the coordinates
(23).

in the following, consider the simple ansatz for v (z), v (z) = z/c; note that since t =
2(c log z + c log z)/(d + 1)d, single valuedness of the map t(z, z) requires c to be real. to see
what kind of singularity this is, consider the ,  components of the einstein equations in the
static gauge:

qg (cid:18) r

g r + g(cid:19) =

1
2

f d
a
m d 2(y  xa) g1/2 g ,

where the hats indicate that the curvatures and metric are those of eq. (7). the metric in the
z-coordinates (21) can be written in the form:

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

ds2 = n 2 ds2

(d) + e2 dz dz ,

where

 =

near the singularity, equation (25) becomes:

1
2



e2 r2 =   =

1
2

f d
a
m d 2(z  xa) ,

where the equality holds up to terms that do not contain delta functions. to calculate the
function  (27) near z = 0, note that these two points are mapped by (20) to t = 
(whether z = 0 is mapped to t = + or  depends on the signs of  and c). these points,
#4in d = 1,  = 0, p (n ) = n 2 + b, so upon changing variables n = |b|1/2 cos  in (23) we recover the solution
obtained in [1] by explicitly solving the equations of motion.

6

on the other hand, correspond to the roots of the polynomial p , n1 and n2. near z = 0
(assume, for concreteness, that z = 0 is mapped to n = n1), the dependence of n on t is easy
to nd upon solving eqn. (16) by keeping the most singular term:

where

|n(z)  n1|  |z|21 ,
p (n1)
n d1

d(d + 1)

2c

1 =

.

(29)

(30)

therefore, near z = 0, the function  from the metric (26) behaves as:

   log |z|11 .

(31)
upon comparison with eq. (28), noting that   = 2(1  1)2(z) we can now nd the
tension of the brane at z = 0,
(32)
we can repeat the same analysis near z =  mapped to the other root, n = n2.#5 it is
convenient to change variables to u = 1/z. note that the metric (26) (and the function ) has
the same form in the u variables. the behavior of n near u = 0 from eq. (16) is:

f d
1 = m d 4 (1  1) .

where

|n(u)  n2|  |u|22 ,
p (n2)
n d1

d(d + 1)

2 =

2c

.

2

(33)

(34)

consequently,    log |u|1+2, and the tension of the brane near z =  is then

f d
2 = m d4 (1 + 2) .

(35)
we note the conditions that 0 < 1 < 1 and 1 < 2 < 0. they follow from requiring
positivity of the brane tensions (2 > 1 and 1 < 1). on the other hand, the distance between
the two branes should be nite along any path in the z-plane, which requires 1 > 0 and 2 < 0;
this follows from considering the interval (21) in the z-coordinates and requiring integrability
of ds near z = 0 and z = .#6 finally, positivity of the metric (21) of the transverse space also
requires that p (n)n 1d be positive as n varies over the interval n1, n2. these restrictions
impose constraints on the various parameters in the action and the solution; these will be
considered for our d = 4 example in section 4.

we can now deduce a general formula for the planck scale and cosmological constant on the

a-th brane. the einstein term in d-dimensional eective action will be:

m d z ddx dn

d

 q det(n 2g(d)) r(d)(n 2gd)

(36)

= z ddxg(d) r(d)(gd) m d z n2

n1

n d2dn  1z d .

#5the leftmost equation in (24) implies that the roots of p (n ) are stationary points of  and the equation of

motion of the branes is also satised at n2.
#6equivalently, 1 > 0, 2 < 0 ensure that the map |z|  n is nondegenerate near the ends of the interval, as
follows from the expressions (29, 33).

7

let the warp factor on the a-th brane be n(a). the physical metric there is the induced metric
n 2
(a)g(d). hence the d-dimensional planck constantthe coecient in front of the curvature
term in the actionwill be:

m d2

p l(a) =

m d
(d  1)

n 2d

(a) (cid:16)n d1

2  n d1

1

(cid:17)  1z d ,

(37)

where the  integral is over the appropriate range that follows from (20) and depends on the
choice of v and . since the induced metric on the a-th brane is n 2
(a)g(d), and since g(d) obeys
the equation (8), the cosmological constant on the a-th brane, denoted by (d),(a), is

(d),(a) = n 2

(a)  .

(38)

similarly, one can derive an expression for the proper distance between the branes at n1 and
n2, which we will present for the case d = 4 in the following section.

4 an explicit example and some speculations.

as an application of the general analysis of the previous section, let us now consider the
physically interesting case d = 4. the polynomial p (n) then is of degree 5. it is easy to see
that if the coecients a, b in p (n) obey#7

a > 0 and 0 < b < .18 a5/2

(39)

then there are two positive roots n1 and n2 of p (n); in addition, p (n) < 0 as n varies
between the two roots, while p (n1) < 0 and p (n2) > 0. since p (n) is negative in the range
of variation of n, the metric (21) is positive denite only for negative , corresponding to de
sitter space in our convention.#8 note that since a  / > 0, this implies that  < 0 as well
and the four dimensional metric on the branes is also de sitter (also note that a solution with
 = 0 does not existthen p (n) has a single real root and the equation (16) can not be solved
for the desired interval of values of t).

we need to satisfy the conditions i > 0 for the root ni which is the image of z = 0 and
j < 0 for the other root nj (the image of z = ), so that the proper distance between the
two roots is nite. since i  cp (ni)/n 3
i , (30, 34), for our choice of two positive roots,
0 < n1 < n2, we nd that sign 1 = sign c and sign 2 = sign c (since  < 0). on the other
hand, since t  c log |z|, if c > 0, then z = 0 is mapped to t = + (and, since f (n) < 0, the
smaller root n1), while z =  is mapped to t =  and, hence, the larger root n1. then the
nite proper distance requirement is satised by the choice c > 0, yielding 1 > 0, 2 < 0. the
coordinate  (20) changes then from (0, 2c) (we chose  = 1/2). expressing the parameters
#7more precisely, the numerical constant on the r.h.s. is (3/5)3/2  (3/5)5/2.
#8this conclusion is always true: in the case of two negative roots of p (n ), which can be achieved by adjusting
the value of b, p > 0 between the roots, but n < 0 and positivity of the metric also requires negative .

there are four parameters in the action with which we started: the 6 dimensional gravita-
tional constant, m, the cosmological constant, , and the tensions of the two branes, f1, f2.
the solution involves three additional dimensionful parameters, the parameter  of the ansatz
for the d-dimensional metric (8), the integration constant  (14), and cthe strength of the
zero of v (z). the equations (40) expressing the tensions for the branes through the other pa-
rameters of the solutions represent two constraints on the seven parameters m, , f1, f2, , , c.
we can use them to eliminate the tensions f1,2 from the list of our parameters. the only im-
portance of eqns. (40) then is that their left hand sides have to be smaller than 1, to ensure
positivity of the brane tensions.

from the four dimensional eective theory point of view the quantities of interest are the
four dimensional planck constant, mp l and the cosmological constant, 4. of interest are
also the mass of kaluza-klein excitations as well as the distance scale where a gravitational
experiment on the brane will reveal deviations from newtons law. the last two quantities
depend, of course on the size of the extra dimensions (and hence on the distance r (42)).
however, due to the warped geometry, there can be also nontrivial dependence on the warp
factors; we leave a detailed investigation of this issue for future work.

to get an idea as to what the eect of the nontrivial warp factors might be, consider rst
the case where the parameters a, b in p (n) (17), (18) satisfy 0 < b << a5/2. the advantage of
this limit is that the roots can be easily approximated by:

n1    b

(43)

note that the case we are considering corresponds to n2  n1the warp factors on the two
branes can be (upon adjusting the parameters, of course) very dierent.

the conditions of positive tensions (40) then imply

p l,i  10120 (or to a value
the physical universe, the parameters should be tuned so that (4),i/m 2
smaller than that; note also that this ratio is the same on both branes, since the warp factors
cancel between numerator and denominator). it is not our objective to solve the cosmological
constant problem; we will only ask whether our parameter space allows for at least a ne-tuned
situation, subject to the constraints imposed by the existence of a solution.

tuning the cosmological constant to the observed small value, therefore, requires that

(48)

it is convenient to work in terms of the dimensionless ratios a, b, (m 2||1), (||c), and keep
 as the only dimensionful parameter.

consider rst the case where the observed universe is at the rst brane. then,

this is a very large distance, unless b  a5/2, which violates (39). if the observed universe is
on the other brane, we obtain instead ||  a1066ev 2 and 1/r  1033ev also a large value
for r.
therefore, if the deviations from newtons law reveal themselves to an experimentalist on
the brane at a distance scale of order r, then we can not accommodate the observed universe
on one of our branes. if, on the other hand, the relevant scale of deviations is nir, then it
is possible to ne-tune the parameters to obtain a value for nir of order a millimeter, and

hence accommodate the observed world in our setup (admittedly with enormous ne-tuning of
parameters!).

the above considerations apply also in a more general situation, where eq. (48) is replaced

by:

which is trivial in the limit b  0 considered before.
assuming that in our geometrical setup the deviations of gravity from newtons law will
show up, to an observer on our brane, at a distance scale of order r, an acceptable value of
1/r > 103ev requires niia1/2 > 1030 (which appears hard to achieve, similar to the example
given above). if the deviations show up at a scale nir, then the requirement is ia1/2 > 1030
(which is achievable via ne tuning). we leave the investigation of this issue for future work.
