abstract

we investigate the thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) equations for a
system of particles which dynamically interacts via the scattering matrix
of ane toda eld theory and whose statistical interaction is of a general
haldane type. up to the rst leading order, we provide general approximated
analytical expressions for the solutions of these equations from which we
derive general formulae for the ultraviolet scaling functions for theories in
which the underlying lie algebra is simply laced. for several explicit models
we compare the quality of the approximated analytical solutions against the
numerical solutions. we address the question of existence and uniqueness
of the solutions of the tba-equations, derive precise error estimates and
determine the rate of convergence for the applied numerical procedure. a
general expression for the fourier transformed kernels of the tba-equations
allows to derive the related y-systems and a reformulation of the equations
into a universal form.

1 introduction

more than twenty years ago yang and yang [1] introduced in a series of seminal
papers a technique which allows to compute thermodynamic quantities for a system
of bosons interacting dynamically via factorizable scattering. this method was
generalized less than ten years ago by al.b. zamolodchikov [2] to a system of
particles which interact dynamically in a relativistic manner through a scattering
matrix which belongs to an integrable quantum eld theory. this latter approach,
usually referred to as thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba), has triggered numerous
further investigations [3-13]. the reason for this activity is twofold, on one hand
the tba serves as an interface between conformally invariant theories and massive
integrable deformations of them and on the other hand it serves as a complementary
approach to other methods.

the tba-approach allows to extract various types of informations from a mas-
sive integrable quantum eld theory once its scattering matrix is known. most
easily one obtains the central charge c of the virasoro algebra of the underlying
ultraviolet conformal eld theory, the conformal dimension  and the factor of
proportionality of the perturbing operator, the vacuum expectation values of the
energy-momentum tensor ht 
i and other interesting quantities. thus, the tba
provides a test laboratory in which certain conjectured scattering matrices may be
probed for consistency.

in addition, the tba is useful since it provides quantities which may be em-
ployed in other contexts, like the computation of correlation functions. for instance
the constant of proportionality, the dimension of the perturbing eld and ht 
i may
be used in a perturbative approach around the operator product expansion of a two
point function within a conformal eld theory [14]. ht 
i may also be used as an
initial value for the recursive system between dierent n-particle form factors [14].
in order to obtain data beyond c one has to investigate the behaviour of the
scaling function c(r) (r is the inverse temperature times a mass scale), which may
be viewed as the deformed central charge of the virasoro algebra. it will be the
central aim of this manuscript to determine this function. certain statements in
this context can be made in complete generality, but of course ultimately one has
to specify some concrete models in order to be more explicit. an attractive choice
for these models are ane toda eld theories [15], since they cover a huge class
of theories due to their lie algebraic formulation and permit therefore to extract
many universal features. ultimately they also allow a comparison against standard
perturbation theory in the spirit of [16].

the rst computation of such a scaling function was carried out in [3] for the
scaling lee-yang model and scaling 3-state potts model (minimal a(1)
2 -ane toda
eld theory). meanwhile there exist several computations of this kind [5, 6, 7, 11].

the general behaviour one nds is

c(r) = ce + f (r) +

cnr2n(1)

xn=1

(1)

where ce = c24h is the eective central charge, with c being the usual conformal
anomaly, i.e. the central charge of the virasoro algebra, and h the lowest conformal
dimension of the underlying conformal eld theory. the cn are some constants
and typically f (r)  r2 or f (r)  r2 ln(r). however, in [12, 13] a quite dierent
behaviour was observed, namely that f (r)  (constln(r))2, which was attributed
therein to zero mode uctuations. it is this kind of behaviour which we nd for all
ane toda eld theories (see equn. (83)). we like to stress that the constant const
should be dierent from zero.

in our investigation we slightly modify and generalize an approach which was
introduced originally in [12]. we also include in our analysis the possibility that
the statistical interaction is of general haldane type [17] and investigate the tba-
equations adapted to this situation [18]. we investigate in detail the expressions
for the tba-kernels and their fourier transformed versions, from which we obtain
a universal form for the relevant tba-equations. we derive the related y-systems.
furthermore, we address the question of the existence and uniqueness of the solu-
tions of the tba equations, derive error estimates and the rate of convergence for
the numerical procedure applied. our analytical considerations culminate with the
derivation of a general expression for the scaling function valid for all ane toda
eld theories in which the underlying lie algebra is simply laced (83) and which
depends in a universal manner only on the rank of the algebra, its coxeter number
and the eective coupling constant. we compare the general formulae against the
numerical solutions for several explicit models, i.e. for the a(1)
3 and
(g(1)

our manuscript is organized as follows: in section 2 we recall the tba-equation
for general haldane statistics and explain how it can be used to compute explicitly
expressions for scaling functions. in section 3 we derive general expression for the
approximated analytical expression for the solutions of the tba-equations and for
the scaling functions c(r).
in section 4 we concretely test our statements for a
system involving the scattering matrix of ane toda eld theories. we compare
the general approximated analytical expression with the numerical solution for some
explicit models. in section 5 we address the question of the existence and uniqueness
of the solutions of the tba equations and derive error estimates and the rate of
convergence. we state our conclusions in section 6.

2 the tba-equations

we consider a multi-particle system involving l dierent types of particles and
assume that the two-particle scattering matrix sij() (as a function of the rapidity
) together with the corresponding mass spectrum (mi is the mass of particle type
i) have been determined. the l coupled tba-equations which describe such a
system, based on the assumption that the dynamical interaction is characterized
by the scattering matrices sij() and whose statistical interaction is governed by
general haldane statistics [17] gij

, read [18]

rmi cosh  + ln(cid:16)1  eli(,r)(cid:17) =

lxj=1

(ij  lj) (, r)

.

(2)

the scaling parameter r is the inverse temperature times a mass scale and we denote

as usual the convolution of two functions f and g by (f  g)() := 1/(2)r df (

)g() and the kernel by

ij() := i

d
d

ln sij()  2gij () = ij()  2gij ()

.

(3)

rof particles inside the system over the densities of i

we recall the important fact that the functions li(, r) are related to the ratio of
densities i
h of available states
as li(, r) = ln(1 + i
h). this implies that li(, r)  0, a property we will
frequently appeal to. in addition we will make use of the fact that li(, r) is an
even function in . once the system of coupled non-linear integral equations (2) is
solved (usually this may only be achieved numerically) for the l unknown functions
li(, r), one is in a position to determine the scaling function

(4)

which may be viewed as the o-critical central charge of the virasoro algebra. we
shall now adopt the method of [12] and instead of regarding the tba-equation as
an integral equation, we transform it into an innite order dierential equation.
this is possible with the sole assumption that the fourier transform of the function
ij() can be expanded as a power series

the bosonic and fermionic statistics correspond to gij = 0 and gij = ij, respectively.

then it is a simple consequence of the convolution theorem that the integral equa-
tion (2) may also be written as an innite order dierential equation

rmi cosh  + ln(cid:16)1  eli(,r)(cid:17) =

lxj=1

xn=0

(n)
ij l(n)

j (, r)

.

(6)

we introduced here the abbreviation l(n)
(, r) = (d/d)nli(, r). the two alter-
native formulations of the tba-equations serve dierent purposes. its variant in
form of an integral equation (2) is most convenient for numerical studies, whereas
the dierential equations (6) turn out to be useful for analytical considerations.

i

from a numerical point of view it is advantageous to make a change of variables
and instead of the functions li(, r) use the so-called pseudo-energies i(, r) dened
via the equations

i(, r) := xj

gijlj(, r)  ln(cid:16)1  eli(,r)(cid:17) .

(7)

for fermionic and bosonic type of statistics the formulation of the tba-equations
in terms of pseudo-energies is most common. however, since (7) may obviously not
be solved in general, it is more convenient to keep the tba-equations in terms of
the li(, r) for general haldane type of statistics. alternatively we may relate all
types of statistics to the fermionic one in the following way. considering a system
which interacts statistically via gij, we can dene the quantity g
ij = ij  gij and
parameterize all lfunctions by li(, r) =: li(, r) = ln(cid:16)1 + ei(,r)(cid:17). then the

tba-equations (2) may be rewritten as

i(, r) = rmi cosh  

lxj=1h(cid:16)(ij + 2g

ij)  lj(cid:17) (, r)i .

(8)

it should be kept in mind that i(, r) (6= i(, r)!) is now a formal parameter
and, except in the fermionic case, it is not related to the ratio of particle densities
i
r/i
h in the characteristic way as a distribution function associated to the relevant
statistics, i.e. i(, r) obtained as a solution of the equations (7).

3 the ultraviolet limit

we shall now analytically investigate the behaviour of the scaling function in the
ultraviolet limit, i.e. r is going to zero. for this purpose we generalize the procedure
of zamolodchikov [12], which leads to approximated analytical expressions. we
attempt to keep the discussion model independent and free of a particular choice

(f  g)() = 1/(2)2r dkef (k)eg(k)eik

4

of the statistical interaction as long as possible. introducing the quantity li() :=
li(  ln(r/2), r) and performing the shift     ln(r/2), the tba-equations (6)
acquire the form

mie + ln(cid:16)1  e li()(cid:17) =

lxj=1

xn=0

(n)
ij

l(n)

j () .

(9)

here we have neglected the terms proportional to e2 ln(r/2), under the assumption
that 2 ln(r/2)  . obviously the r-dependence has vanished, such that the li()
are r-independent. the equation for the scaling function (4) becomes, under similar
manipulations and the neglect of similar terms as in the derivation of (9),

c(r) =

6
2

lxi=1

mi

zln(r/2)

d li()e

.

(10)

in analogy to the procedure of [12], we consider now the so-called truncated

scaling function

c(r, r) =

6
2

lxi=1

mi

zr

d li()e

,

(11)

which obviously coincides with c(r) for r = ln(r/2). at this point we make several
assumptions:

i) the functions li() obey the equations (9).

ii) in the power series expansion (5) the coecients are symmetric in the particle

type indices, i.e. (n)

ij = (n)
ji .

iii) all odd coecients vanish in (5), i.e. (2n+1)

ij

= 0.

iv) the asymptotic behaviour of the function li() and its derivatives read

e li() = 0

(12)

(13)

assumption ii) is guaranteed when the two-particle scattering matrix is parity
invariant and the statistical interaction is symmetric in particle type, gij = gji.
the requirement iii) puts of course constraints on the scattering matrices for given
statistics, or vice versa.
it will turn out in the next section, that for fermionic
statistics it is satised by all scattering matrices of interest to us. the asymptotic
behaviour iv) will be veried in retrospective, that is all known numerical solutions
exhibit this kind of asymptotic behaviour.

under these assumptions the truncated scaling function may also be written as

(15)

one may now verify by direct substitution that (15) is solved by (14) when i)-iii)
hold. the constant of integration is xed by the property c(r,) = 0, such that
(14) is exact if iv) holds.

3.1 the extreme limit

one of the best known outcomes of the tba-analysis is the fact that in the extreme
ultraviolet limit the scaling function becomes the eective central charge of the
underlying ultraviolet conformal eld theory, i.e.
in order to
carry out this limit, we note that the assumptions (12) and (13) also imply

limr0 c(r) = ce.

(16)

such that equations (6) become a set of coupled non-linear equations for the l
constants li(0, 0)

ln(cid:16)1  eli(0,0)(cid:17) =
due to the fact that li(, r) is positive, we deduce that these equations admit
physical solutions when (0)
ij  0. for a given s-matrix this condition will restrict
possible statistical interactions. with the help of the solutions of (17) we recover
from (14) the well known formula for the extreme ultraviolet limit

(18)

these equations have been analyzed extensively in the literature for various models
[3, 5, 20, 10] and as we demonstrated, also hold for general (haldane) type of
statistics.

the identity

xr0

dt ln(1  et) = l(1  ex) + x/2 ln(1  ex) is useful in this context.

3.2 next leading order

in order to keep the next leading order in the ultraviolet limit we proceed as follows:
under the assumption that the symmetry property of li() still holds at this point of
the derivation, we may neglect in (9) also the term e. assuming that li() is large
and (12) holds, the tba-equation in the ultraviolet limit may be approximated by

((2)

lxj=1

lj()) + e li() = 0 .

(19)

unfortunately this equation may not be solved analytically in its full generality.
however, choosing now the statistics in such a way that the (0)
ij = 0 we
may solve (19). in most cases we shall be considering in the following, this condition
implies that we have fermionic type of statistics. for this case the solution of (19)
reads

j=1 (0)

li() = ln  sin2 (i (  i))

i (2)

! + ln

22

2e2
with i, i,ei,ei being the constants of integration and (2)

ij . note that
the assumption (2)
6= 0 is not always guaranteed below. we will discard the second
term in the following w.l.g. under the same assumptions the expression for the
truncated scaling function (14) becomes

i

i =pl
cos2(cid:16)ei(cid:16) ei(cid:17)(cid:17)

lxi=1(cid:18)(2)

substitution of the solution (20) into (21) yields

c(r, r) = l

(21)

(22)

notice that this expression for the truncated eective central charge is independent
of the constants i and r. we use the latter property to argue that in fact the r.h.s.
of (22) corresponds to the scaling function c(r). invoking now also the property
li() = li(2 ln(r/2)  ) we obtain the additional relations

i =

n

2(i  ln(r/2))

,

(23)

with n being an odd integer, which we choose to be one. at the moment we do not
have any further argument at hand in order to x the remaining constant. therefore
we have

(28)

using the fact that i tends to zero for small r, the equations (25)-(28) demonstrate
the consistency with the assumption that the derivatives of li(, r) with respect to
 are negligible, i.e. equation (16). closer inspection shows that for given r the
series build from the l(n)
(, r) starts to diverge at a certain value of n. since (24)
is not exact this does not pose any problem, but one should be aware of it. the
scaling function becomes in this approximation

(29)

as already pointed out there does not seem to be any argument in this approach
which allows to x the constant i. however, we will present below a natural guess
and also resort to numerical data to x it.

in order to perform more concrete computations one has to specify a particular

model at this point.

4 ane toda field theory

ane toda eld theories [15] constitute a huge, important and well studied class
of relativistically invariant integrable models in 1+1 dimensions. the exact two-
particle scattering matrices of all ane toda eld theories with real coupling con-
stant were constructed on the base of the bootstrap principle [21] and its generalized
version [26]. various cases have been checked perturbatively. the theories exhibit
an entirely dierent behaviour depending on whether they are self-dual or not. here
duality has a double meaning, on one hand it refers to the invariance of the algebra
under the interchange of roots and co-roots (i.e. a(1)
8 ) and
on the other hand it refers to the strong-weak duality in the coupling constant.

4.1.1 simply laced lie algebras

we recall now some well known facts about the two particle scattering matrix and

theories related to simply laced lie algebras the two particle s-matrices [21, 22, 23]

(32)

we adopt here the notations of [23] and denote the coxeter number by h, funda-
mental weights by i, the colour values related to the bicolouration of the dynkin
diagram by c(i) and a simple root i times c(i) by i. the coxeter element is chosen

to be  = +, where the elements  = qi i are introduced, with i being
a weyl reections and  the set of simple roots with colour values c(i) = 1,
respectively. the eective coupling constant b() = (2/2)/(1 + 2/4) depends
monotonically on the coupling constant  and takes values between 0 and 2.

many of the properties of (30) are very well documented in the literature [21,
22, 23] and we will therefore only concentrate on those which are relevant for our
investigations. one of the remarkable features is the strong-weak duality in the
coupling constant , which is a particular example for one of the dualities which are
currently ubiquitous in string theoretical investigations. whilst in the latter context
duality serves as a powerful principle, we will frequently employ it as a simple
consistency check on various expressions which arise during our computations. the
strong-weak duality manifests itself by the fact that each individual building block,
and consequently the whole s-matrix, possesses the symmetry b  2  b. a
further check, which we wish to pursue from time to time for consistency reasons,
is taking the coupling constant to zero, i.e. b(0) = 0 or equivalently b() = 2,
such that we obtain a free theory with sij() = 1. also we want to compare with
some known results for the so-called minimal part of the scattering matrix (30),
which is formally obtained by taking the limit b  i.
it will be important below to recall that the block {1} only occurs (with power
one) in the scattering matrix between two particles of the same type, i.e. in sii(),

 this part satises by itself the bootstrap equations and the additional factor is of a cdd-

nature, meaning that is does not produce any relevant poles inside the physical sheet.

 for the blocks {x} in form of hyperbolic functions this limit is trivial. for the integral
representation (31 ) it requires a bit more eort, but is easily veried with the help of the riemann-
lebesgue theorem (if g(x)  l1(,) then lim

 g(x)eitxdx = 0).

which implies for the s-matrices (30) sij(0) = (1)ij . a further relation which
exhibits the occurrence of particular blocks is

,

c(i) 6= c(j) .

(33)

here iij is the incidence matrix of the lie algebraic dynkin diagram, i.e. twice the
unit matrix minus the cartan matrix k. since relation (33) will be important for
our analysis and does not seem to appear in the literature, we will briey prove it
here. we make use of the interrelation between the incidence matrix and particular
elements of the weyl group and the action of these elements on simple roots [24, 23]

rxj=1

iijj = ( + +)i

and

c(i)j = (c(j)c(i))/2j .

(34)

taking the inner product of the rst equation in (34) with j and the subsequent
application of the second relation on the r.h.s. yields

iij = i  c(j)j + i  c(j)j = i  j  i  c(j)j .

(35)

therefore, by the orthogonality of fundamental weights and simple roots and the
symmetry in i and j, it follows directly that

i  1j = iij ,
noting further that {x} = {2h  x}1
iij from the product in (30) and obtain (33).

 , we may extract the block {2} with power
remarkably one may also carry out the product in (30) and obtain a closed

the lie algebraic quantities involved in this identity, i.e. i and h, are more easily
accessible than the orbits of the coxeter elements, however, this is at the cost that
the singularity structure is less transparent. formula (37) coincides with equation
(5.2) in [25] (up to a factor (1)ij ), once the general expression in there is reduced
to the simply laced case.

in the course of our argumentation we will also employ the identity

4.1.2 non-simply laced lie algebras

once one turns to the consideration of ane toda eld theories related to non-
simply laced lie algebras many of the universal features which one observes for
simply laced lie algebras cease to be valid. for instance for the simply laced lie
algebras it is known that the singularities of (30) inside the physical sheet do not
depend on the coupling constant and remarkably all masses renormalise with an
overall factor. these latter behaviours dramatically change once the related lie
algebras are taken to be non-simply laced (except a(2)
2n which is also self-dual).
in fact in these cases one can not associate anymore a unique lie algebra to the
quantum eld theory, but a dual pair related to each other by the interchange of
roots and co-roots. general formulae similar to (30), which are valid for all non-
simply lie laced algebras have not been constructed yet. however, one can still
construct s-matrices [26, 27]

(40)

in distinction to the simply laced case, the variable x may now become non-integer,
y is 0, 1/2, 1 or 1/4 and

the coxeter number h has been replaced by a oating coxeter number  h, in the
sense that it equals the coxeter number of one of the two dual algebras in the weak
limit and the other in the strong limit. the singularities of (39) now depend on
the coupling constant which leads to a modication of the bootstrap as explained
in [26]. the shift of the masses resulting from the renormalization procedure can
not be compensated anymore by an overall factor.

in contrast to the simply laced case, the control over the set in which x and
y take their values is slightly dierent than in (30). whereas in (30) the powers
of the blocks may be computed directly from the lie algebraic quantities, in the
non-simply laced case they are obtained solving at rst some recursive equations
and thereafter extracting the powers from a generating function [25]. there exists
however a generalization of (37) which also includes the non-simply laced case. in
this paper we will not treat the completely generic case and shall be content with
treatment of one particular case in order to exhibit the dierence towards the simply
laced case, such that (39) and (40) are sucient for our purposes.

4.2 the tba-kernels

given the s-matrices we are now in a position to compute the relevant quantities for
our analysis, i.e. the kernels appearing in the tba-equations (2) and the fourier
coecients in equation (5).

4.2.1 simply laced lie algebras

taking the logarithmic derivative of the phase of the scattering matrix (30) the
tba-kernels (without the statistics factor) are easily computed to

ij() = 

1

where

x() = i

(42)

(43)

(44)

we introduced the function x() = sin(x/h)/(cos(x/h)cosh ) and set 0() =
0. depending on the context either the variant (43) or (44) turn out to be more
convenient. the fourier transform is most easily evaluated when we use the integral
representation (43) for each block

 fx,b(k)

sinh k

ex(k) = 

= ex1(k) +ex+1(k) ex+b1(k) exb+1(k),

where ex(k) = 2 sinh[(x/h  1)k]/ sinh(k). therefore we have
hxq=1
(i  q+(c(j)1)/2j)e2q+(c(j)c(i))/21(k) .

eij(k) = 

1
2

(45)

(46)

(47)

this means, that just like the s-matrix itself, we may express the tba-kernels
and their fourier transformed versions in terms of general blocks. the dierence
is that now instead of the powers of the blocks their pre-factors are determined
by orbits of the coxeter element. notice also that the property {x} = {2h + x}
guaranteed that in (30) the products qh
q=0 are equivalent. since now
ex(k) 6= e2h+x(k), we have to take the sum over the appropriate range. this is the

reason why q is shifted in (47). remarkably for the fourier transformed kernels it
is possible to evaluate the whole sum over q in (47) in an indirect way. we obtain

q=1 and qh1

a similar matrix identity has turned out to be extremely useful in the inves-
tigation [4] of the tba-kernel for the minimal part of the scattering matrix (30).
equation (48) coincides with an identity quoted in [13] once the roaming param-
eter therein is chosen in such the way that the resonance scattering matrices take
on the form of (30). taking the inverse fourier transform of (49) we obtain after
an intgeration with respect to  the integral representation (37) for the scattering
matrix.

since the identity (48) is by no means obvious, in particular with regard to
(47), we will now provide a rigourous proof of it. essentially we have to use the
fourier transformed version of the relation (38) for this purpose. shifting the fourier
integral into the complex plane yields

lim

ic



dij()eik = eij(k)  pz dij(cid:18)  i



h(cid:19) eik(i/h)

= 2ijebk/h  iijek/h .

(50)

(51)

here the contours c
 are depicted in gure 1. p denotes the cauchy principal value.
the poles inside the contours are collected by considering (42) and (44). obviously
coupling constant dependent poles may only result from 1() and 2h1(), whilst
poles directly on the contours at  = i/h may only originate from 2() and
2h2(). from the statements made in subsection 4.1.1., it follows that the former
blocks may only occur when i = j and from equation (33) we infer that the pre-factor
of 2() is iij. the relevant residues are computed easily and by noting further that
the singularities directly on the contour count half, we have established (51).

acting now with i times the logarithmic derivative on the identity (38), mul-

tiplying with exp(ik) and integrating thereafter with respect to  we obtain

pz d(cid:16)ij ( + i/h) + ij (  i/h)(cid:17) eik =

rxl=1

iilelj(k) .

(52)

on the other hand the l.h.s. of (52) may be computed alternatively from the right
hand sides of (50) and (51), such that we obtain

rxl=1

iilelj(k) = 2eij(k) cosh

 in the complex -plane. the bullets  belong to poles resulting

and therefore (48).

when we take the limit b  i, the coupling constant dependent poles move
outside the contours c
 , such that the term involving b will be absent in (53) and
we recover the result of [4]. the weak limit b  0 turns equ. (53) into a trivial
identity by noting that with (48) limb0eij(k) = 2ij.
as the last quantity which will be important for our considerations we have to
compute the power series expansion of eij(k). for this purpose we make use of the

which follows directly from the generating function for the bernoulli polynomials
bn(x) of degree n (e.g.
[28]). we may then expand each building block of the
fourier transformed tba-kernel (45) as

ex(k) = 2

(55)

(56)

where the coecients are  (2n)

x = 2(2)2n/(2n + 1)!b2n+1(x/(2h)). therefore we

14

obtain for the fourier coecients in equation (5)

ij = ijgij

and (2n)

ij =

hxq=1

2q+(c(j)c(i))/21

(57)

for n = 1, 2, . . . the second order coecient is particularly important with regard to
our approximated analytical solution presented in section 3.2 and we will therefore
analyze it a bit further. from (56) we obtain (2)
x = 2b(b  2)(h  x)/h3, such
that

(2)
ij =

1
2h3

hxq=1
(i  q+(c(j)1)/2j)2b(b  2)(h  2q  (c(j)  c(i))/2 + 1) . (58)

we may evaluate the sum over q by noting further that

i =

1
h

hxq=1

qq+(c(i)1)/2i

and

hxq=1

i  qj = 0 .

(59)

the rst identity follows by inverting the relation i = (1  1)(1c(i))/2i [23]
and the second by computing the geometric series. therefore (58) becomes

(2)
ij =

2b(2  b)

h2

i  j =

2b(2  b)

h2

k 1
ij

.

(60)

the latter formula follows immediately by recalling that i = pr

ij j. it has
the virtue that it is directly applicable since it involves only quantities which may
be eortlessly extracted from lie algebraic tables. at last we may compute the
quantity (2)
ij which occurs in our approximated analytical approach
(20). obviously we obtain from (60)

j=1 k 1

j=1 (2)

i = pr

i =

i   ,

(61)

(62)

(63)

where  = pr

i=1 i = 1/2p>0  is the weyl vector. the inner product of i 

 may be related to a universal quantity, namely the index of the fundamental

such that we nally obtain

in a universal manner. we may proceed

(64)

here we used the freudenthal-devries strange formula 2 = qdimg/24 (see e.g.
[29]), the fact that for simply laced algebras the eigenvalue of the quadratic casimir
operator is q = 2h and that we have dimg= r(h + 1) for the dimension of the lie
algebra g.

4.2.2 non-simply laced lie algebras

for the non-simply laced cases we may proceed similarly, just now we are lacking the
universality of the previous subsection. using the generalized blocks (40) instead
of (31) we derive

x,y() = i

is important for our purposes.

4.3 the tba-equations

having computed the tba-kernels, it appears at rst sight that, apart from a
simple substitution, there is not much more to be said about the form of the tba-
equations. however, zamolodchikov observed in [4] that once the fourier trans-
formed tba-kernels admit a certain representation (in our situation this is (48)),
the tba-equations may be cast into a very universal form.

we will exploit now the universal features derived in the preceding section.
in order to keep the notation simple, we commence by choosing the statistical
interaction to be fermionic at rst. the generalization to generic haldane statistics
is straightforward thereafter. first of all, we fourier transform the tba-equations
in the variant (8)

2ei(k, r) =

rxj=1eij(k)elj(k, r) .

16

for the reason that the fourier transforms of rmi cosh  and i(, r) do not exist
separately, we introduced here the quantity i(, r) = rmi cosh  i(, r). this
should be kept in mind before transforming back to the original variables. substi-
tuting now the general form of eij(k) from (48) into equation (71) and taking the

inverse fourier transformation thereafter yields

i(, r) =

rxj=1(cid:16)iij(j  lj)  h(cid:17) (, r) + (li  h,b)(, r) .

here we introduced the universal kernels

h() =

h

2 cosh h
2 

and h,b() =

2h sin 
2 b cosh h
2 
cosh h  cos b

.

neglecting the coupling constant dependent term involving h,b(), i.e.
taking
the limit b  i, the identities (72) coincide precisely with the equations (7) in
[4]. this is to be expected since the latter equations describes the system which
dynamically interacts via the minimal part of (30). note further that the strong-
weak duality is still preserved, i.e. h,b() = h,2b().

we may now easily derive the generalized form of (72) for generic types of
haldane statistics. recalling that for the derivation of (8) all the lfunctions
were parameterized by li(, r) = ln(cid:16)1 + ei(,r)(cid:17) and the statistical interaction by
gij = ij  g

ij, the fourier transformation reads

(72)

(73)

(74)

rxj=1hg

ij elj(k, r) +eij(k)elj(k, r)/2i .

ei(k, r) =
rxj=1"iij(j 

rxl=1

in the same manner as for the fermionic case we derive

i(, r) =

(jl + g

jl)ll)  h + g

ijlj# (, r) + (li h,b)(, r) . (75)

of course we recover (72) from (75) for g

ij = 0.

as a nal consistency check we carry out the limit to the free theory, that is

b  0. we have

lim

(li  h,b)(, r) = lim

in the last equality we employed the well known representation for the delta function
(x) = lim0 /(2 + x2). this means that in the extreme weak limit the tba-
equations (75) is solved by

i(, r) = rmi cosh  

(ij + g

ij)lj(, r) .

rxj=1

(79)

that (79) are indeed the tba-equations may also be seen by taking this limes
directly in (8) and noting that limb0 ij() = ij(). in this way we have switched
o the dynamical interaction and obtained a system which interacts purely by
statistics. in particular for fermionic type of statistics (g
ij = ij
these equations describe r free bosons or r free fermions, respectively. taking
g
ij to be diagonal, the equations (79) are equivalent to a system whose s-matrix
corresponds to the one of the calogero-sutherland model and whose statistical
interaction is taken to be of fermionic type [18].

ij = 0) or for g

we nish this subsection by noting that pj iijmj = 2mi cos(/h) [30], from

which follows

rmi cosh  = r

iijmj (coshh) (, r) ,

(80)

rxj=1

such that the entire r-dependence and the mass spectrum in (72) and (75) may be
eliminated. we obtain

i(, r) =

rxj=1"iij(j +

rxl=1

(jl + g

jl)ll)  h  g

ijlj# (, r)  (li  h,b)(, r)

(81)

instead. one may solve these equations and re-introduce the r-dependence there-
after by means of the asymptotic behaviour. this is similar to the situation in
the next subsection, in which the equations are even further simplied to a set of
functional equations.

4.4 y-systems

an alternative analytical approach is provided by exploiting properties of what is
often referred to as y-systems [4]. in order to derive these equations, we invoke
once more the convolution theorem on the convolution in equation (8) and compute

thereafter the sum of (8) at  + i/h and  i/h minuspj iij times (8).using once
more the fact that pj iijmj = 2mi cos(/h), the terms involving mi cancel. em-
ploying thereafter the identity (53) and transforming back into the original space
we obtain, upon the introduction of the new variable yi () = exp(i()),
h (1  b)(cid:17)i
yi(cid:16)+ i
[1 + yl ()]ijl(cid:19)g
rqj=1(cid:16)1 + y 1


h (1  b)(cid:17)ih1 + yi(cid:16)  i
h(cid:17)ih1 + yj(cid:16) i

h(cid:17) =h1 + yi(cid:16) + i
()(cid:17)iji(cid:18)h1 + yj(cid:16)+ i

h(cid:17) yi(cid:16) i

h(cid:17)i rql=1

j

ij

.

18

for fermionic statistics, i.e. g
ij = 0 we recover the systems stated in [12] (h = 2) and
[13], when we chose the roaming parameter therein such that s() equals (30).
the strong-weak duality is evidently still preserved. the y-systems corresponding
to the minimal theories are obtained by taking the limit b  i, by noting
that lim yi () = 0. the latter limes follows from the tba-equations together
with the explicit form of the tba-kernel, such that for large  we have i() 
rmi cosh . for fermionic type of statistics the functional equations obtained in this
limit coincide with those found in [4]. as is to be expected from (79), we obtain for
g
ij = 0 (for h = 0 this holds in general) in the extremely weak coupling limit

yi (+2i) = yi () ,

b  0, 2 .

(82)

to derive these periodicities directly from the functional equations is rather cum-
bersome once the algebras are more complicated and we do not have a general case
independent proof. this is similar to the situation in which the system involved
is the minimal part of (30) [4]. we leave it for future investigations to exploit the
functional equations further.

4.5 scaling functions

as already stated, solving the tba-equations and the subsequent evaluation of
(4) leads to expressions of the scaling function c(r) with the inverse temperature r
times a mass scale as the scaling parameter. we may carry out this task numerically.
alternatively, assembling our results from section 3 and the analysis of the tba-
kernel, we can write down a universal formula for the scaling function of the system
in which the statistical interaction is of fermionic type and in which the dynamical
interaction is governed by the scattering matrix of ane toda eld theories related
to simply laced lie algebras, up to the rst leading order in the ultraviolet regime.
from (29) and (64) it follows under the assumption that the constants i are the
same for all particle types

cg(r) = rankg 1 

2b(2  b)(h + 1)

4h(  ln(r/2))2 ! .

(83)

we will now compute step by step several scaling functions for ane toda eld
theories in which we specify some concrete algebras. we gradually increase the
complexity of the models and focus on dierent aspects.

4.5.1 a(1)

1 -atft (sinh-gordon)

the sinh-gordon theory is one of the simplest quantum eld theories in 1+1 di-
mensions and therefore the ideal starting point to concretely test general statements

19

made in this context. semi-classical investigations of a tba-type nature concern-
ing this model may already be found in [31]. the model contains only one stable
particle which does not fuse and its scattering matrix simply reads

ssg () = {1} =

.

(84)

tanh 1

tanh 1

2(cid:16)  i
2 b(cid:17)
2(cid:16) + i
2 b(cid:17)

for a system whose dynamics is described by this s-matrix and whose statistical
interaction is of general haldane type, the tba-equation (2) reads

rm cosh  + ln(1  el(,r)) =

1
2

z

dsg () l(  , r)  gl(, r)

(85)

with

sg () = 2,b() =

4 sin(b/2) cosh 
cosh 2  cos b

.

(86)

we may convince ourselves that (85) can be obtained from (2) and the direct com-
putation of the kernel as well as from (75) by noting that the incidence matrix of
course vanishes for the a(1)
1

related dynkin diagram.

the weak coupling limit b  0 is read o from (79)

rm cosh  + ln(1  el(,r)) + gl(, r) = l(, r)

.

(87)

20

the other limes which may be computed in the standard way is the limes r  0,

leading to the constant tba-equation

ln(cid:16)1  el(0,0)(cid:17) = (1  g)l(0, 0)

.

(88)

this is obviously compatible with equation (87) and indicates that the extreme
ultraviolet behaviour is independent of the dynamics and is purely governed by the
statistics. in particular we obtain for fermionic type of statistics l(0, 0)   as
a solution of (88), such that with (18) the eective central charge turns out to be
one. in general (88) yields 0  ce  1 for g  1. we also observe that due to the
fact that l(0, 0)  0, equation (88) does not possess any physical solutions at all
for g < 1, which means in particular that there are no solutions for the statistical
interaction of bosonic type.

we shall now turn to the full solution of the tba-equation (85). first of all
we solve this equation numerically. for g  1 we observe in gure 2 the typical
behaviour, known from the analysis of the minimal part of the s-matrices [3], that
the l-function is essentially constant between 2 ln(r/2). as expected from the
previous discussion, also the numerical analysis does not yield any solution for g < 1.
for a more detailed discussion concerning the nature of the numerical procedure
and in particular the question of convergence and uniqueness of the solutions we
refer to section 5.

we shall now compare our numerical results with our analytic approximations
of section 3. the general formulae (45) or (48) yields for the fourier transform of
the tba-kernel

for the reasons mentioned in section 3.2, we will now restrict ourselves to

fermionic type of statistics, such that

(0) = 0

and

(2) =

2b(2  b)

8

.

(90)

we obtain a fairly good agreement between the numerical solution of (2) for the
function l(, r) and the approximated analytical solution (24), if we choose the
constants in (20) to be

such that

 = ln(b(2  b)21+b(2b))

and

figure 3: numerical solution (a) versus approximated analytical solution (b) for the sinh-

figure 3 shows that the r dependence of l(, r) is captured very well by the
approximated analytical solution (92). as expected from the nature of the assump-
tions made in the derivation, (24) becomes relatively poor when l(, r) is small.
with regard to the aim of these computations, that is the evaluation of the scaling
function c(r), precisely in this region the error is negligible as is seen from (4). no-
tice also that the assumptions (16) are justied in retrospective by the numerical
solutions. the quality of the approximation may also be seen by comparing tables
1-3 for large values of l(, r).

in comparison to the sinh-gordon model the next complication arises when we
allow the particle in the system to fuse. this case will arise when we consider the

two particles which are conjugate to each other, whereas the latter contains only
one particle which is the bound state of itself. with regard to the tba-analysis
these models may be treated on the same footing. the corresponding two particle

qualitative agreement as we observed for the previous models. for all models we
observe that at about r = 0.1 the analytical expressions for c(r) start to decrease
more rapidly than the numerical solution.

this theory is the simplest example for a model in which the masses as a function
of the coupling constant ow from the classical mass spectrum of one lagrangian to
its dual in the lie algebraic sense. the theory contains two self-conjugate particles
whose masses were conjectured [32, 33] (supported by numerical investigations [34])
to m1 = m sin(/h) and m2 = m sin(2/h). the oating coxeter number is
taken to be h = 6 + 3b with 0  b  2. the fusing processes 1 1  1 + 2,

(116)

besides the loss of duality these scattering matrices exhibit a further dierence in
comparison with the simply laced case, which has a bearing on the tba-analysis.
in the standard prescription the symmetry of the bethe wave function is derived by
exploiting the behaviour of the scattering matrices at  = 0. as already mentioned
for the simply laced case we always have sij(0) = (1)ij , whereas now we observe
sg/d
(0) = 1. assuming that the particles described are bosons,
22
we should choose, according to the arguments of [2], g11 = 1 and g22 = 0.
in
this case, however, the tba-analysis does not produce any physical solution. the
tba-equations in the variant (8) become

much has changed in comparison with the previous models and we can still solve

itatively the same as in the previous cases and the scaling functions for some values
of the eective coupling are depicted in gure 5 together with the same function for
the a(1)
2 -ane toda eld theory. we observe that for xed value of r, the scaling
function for the (g(1)

function of b. under the same circumstances the scaling functions related to theo-
ries in which the underlying algebras are simply laced are monotonically decreasing
at rst up to the self-dual point b = 1 and monotonically increase thereafter.

5 existence and uniqueness properties

in this section we are going to investigate the existence and uniqueness properties
of the solutions of the tba equations. our main physical motivation for this con-
siderations is to clarify whether it is possible to obtain dierent eective central
charges for a xed dynamical and statistical interaction due to the existence of sev-
eral dierent solutions of the tba equation. as a side product we obtain useful
estimates on the error and the rate of convergence of the applied numerical proce-
dure. precise estimates of this kind were not obtained previously in this context
and convergence is simply presumed. the method we employ is the contraction
principle (or banach xed point theorem), see e.g. [35]. for the yangyang equa-
tion in the case of the nonrelativistic onedimensional bose gas for fermionic type
of statistics the uniqueness question was already addressed by yang and yang [1],
albeit with a dierent method.

in order to keep the notation simple we commence our discussion for a system
with one particle only and a statistics of fermionic type. thereafter we discuss the
straightforward generalization. the standard way to solve integral equations of the

29

type (8) consists in discretising the original function and a subsequent iteration,
usually numerically. normalizing the mass to one, this means we consider (8) as

n+1(, r) := r cosh     ln(1 + en(,r))

(126)

and perform the iteration starting with 0(, r) = r cosh . the exact solution is
then thought to be the limes limn n. however, a priori it is not clear whether
this limes exists at all and how it depends on the initial value 0. in particular,
dierent initial values might lead to dierent solutions.

the natural mathematical setup for this type of problem is to re-write the tba-

equation as

(a)(, r) :=   ln(1 + e(,r)r cosh ) = (, r),

and treat it as a xed point problem for the operator a.

(127)

in order to give meaning to the limes limn n we have to specify a norm. of
course it is natural to assume that  as function of  is measurable, continuous and
essentially bounded on the whole real line. the latter assumption is supported by
all known numerical results. furthermore it follows from (127), together with the
explicit form of , that possible solutions  vanish at innity. this means possible
solutions of (127) constitute a banach space with respect to the norm

kfk = ess sup|f ()| ,

(128)

i.e. l(ir). in principle we are now in a position to apply the banach xed point
theoremk, which states the following:

let d  l be a nonempty set in a banach space and let a be an operator
for all f, g  d and some xed q,
(129)

which maps d q-contractively into itself, i.e.
0  q < 1

ka(f )  a(g)k  qkf  gk.

then the following statements holds:

i) there exists a unique xed point  in d, i.e. equation (127) has exactly one

solution.

ii) the sequence constructed in (126) by iteration converges to the solution of

(127).

iii) the error of the iterative procedure may be estimated by

k  nk 

qn

1  qk1  0k and

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)  n+1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) 

q

1  q(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)n+1  n(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

.

kone may of course apply dierent types of xed point theorems exploiting dierent properties
of the operator a. for instance if a is shown to be compact one can employ the leray-schauder
xed point theorem. in the second refence of [5] it is claimed that the problem at hand was treated
in this manner, albeit a proof was not provided.

30

iv) the rate of convergence is determined by

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)  n+1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)  q k  nk .
in order to be able to apply the theorem we rst have to choose a suitable
set in the banach space. we choose some q  [0, 1) such that er  q and take
1q + ro. we may now apply
d to be the convex set dq,r := nf : kfk  ln q
the following estimate for the convolution operator  (which is a special case of
youngs inequality)
(130)
k  fk  kk1kfk.

for the concrete one particle models at hand, the sinh-gordon- and the bullough-
2|()| = 1. for the operator l we have the

dodd-model, we have kk1 := r d

estimate

l(f )  ln [1 + exp (kfk  r)]  ln

1

1  q  ln

q
1  q

+ r.

the last inequality follows from our special choice of q. thus, a maps dq,r into
itself.

in the nal step we show that the contraction property (129) is fullled on dq,r .
it suces to prove this for the map l, because of (130) and the fact that kk1 = 1.
we have

in the last inequality we used the fact that dq,r is a convex set.

we may now safely apply the xed point theorem. first of all we conclude from
i) and ii) that a solution of (127) not only exists, but it is also unique. in addition
we can use iii)and iv) as a criterium for error estimates. from our special choice
of the closed set dq,r one sees that the rate of convergence depends crucially on
the parameter r, the smaller r the greater q is, whence the sequence (n) converges
slower.

for f, g  dq,r also tf + (1  t)g  dq,r, with 0  t  1.

31

one could be mathematically more pedantic at this point and think about dif-
ferent requirements on the function . for instance one might allow functions which
are not bounded (we do not know of any example except when r  0) and then
pursue similar arguments as before on lp rather than l.
the generalization of the presented arguments to a situation involving l dif-
ferent types of particles and general haldane statistics may be carried out in a
straightforward manner.

6 conclusions

clearly an unsatisfactory feature of our approximated analytical expression for the
scaling function (83) is that, at the moment, we do not have any additional con-
straint at hand which allows to determine the constant . admittedly the choice
(91) enters our analysis in a rather ad hoc way. at the moment the rational behind
our choice is that we may compare it with the semi-classical results in the spirit of
[12] and thereafter restore the strong-weak duality. in addition it is supported by
our numerical results. surely this is by no means unique and it is highly desirable
to eliminate this ambiguity.

k=1 (k)

1/((1)

nonetheless, dierent choices of the constant will not change the overall be-
haviour and our expression is clearly in conict with the results of cassi and destri
[16], who found f (r) = 3r2m2
11 ) for the function in equation (1). the con-
vention therein are that 1 labels the particle type with smallest mass and (1)
11 results
from the power series 11() = p
11 exp(k ||). on the side of the tba-
analysis the origin of this discrepancy may be tracked down easily. a behaviour of
the type quoted in [16] was derived before in [12, 5] for ane toda eld theories
related to the minimal part of the scattering matrix (30). this result was then
extrapolated by cassi and destri in the way that (1)
11 was taken to be the coe-
cient of the power series related to the full coupling constant dependent scattering
matrix. however, the derivations in [12, 5] rely heavily on the assumption that the
function l() is constant in the region  ln(2/r)    ln(2/r). it is essentially
this property which is lost for the full theory (as our numerical results demonstrate),
such that the arguments of cassi and destri become faulty. it would be interesting
to settle the question also on the perturbative side and bring our results into agree-
ment with perturbation theory. our ndings will surely have consequences for the
subtraction scheme used in such considerations.

there exist of course other methods which allow to extract the ultraviolet central
charge from a massive integrable model. the c-theorem [36] has turned out to be
very ecient in this context and a direct comparison is very suggestive. as the
main input, the c-theorem requires the n-particle form factors (the 2-particle form
factor is usually sucient) related to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor.
unlike in the situation of conformal invariance, in which the trace vanishes, this

32

tensor is not unique and acquires some scaling behaviour for massive theories. as
observed in [38], the consequence of this fact is that the c-theorem produces a whole
ray of central charges greater than the rank of the underlying lie algebra g. the
natural question which arises is to identify the origin of this ambiguity inside the
tba-approach. one might assume that it results from several possible solutions
of the tba-equation. however, this possibility is denitely ruled out as follows
from our investigations in section 5. since the statistical interaction g enters the
analysis as a further parameter, this could provide a further possible mechanism
which produces the observed values. as our investigations demonstrate, however,
also this possibility can be excluded for certain, since dierent choices for g only
produce central charges smaller than the rank of g. in the light of this results we
conjecture that the responsible mechanism is to include a non-vanishing chemical
potential in the way as was already indicated by yang and yang [1]. to settle this
question precisely requires more detailed investigations [37].

there are several further questions which should be addressed in order to com-
plete the picture. it will certainly be interesting to obtain also the higher terms
beyond the rst leading order in (1) and to exploit further the y-systems of section
4.4. as an alternative analytical approach. there exist interesting links between
these systems and spectral functions [39], such that one can expect more exact and
universal results to follow.
