abstract

we consider black holes in anti-de sitter space adsp+2 (p = 2, 3, 5), which
have hyperbolic, at or spherical event horizons. the o(3) corrections (or
the leading corrections in powers of the eleven-dimensional planck length, in
the case of m-theory compactications) to the black hole metrics are com-
puted for the various topologies and dimensions. we investigate the conse-
quences of the stringy or m-theory corrections for the black hole thermody-
namics.
in particular, we show the emergence of a stable branch of small
spherical black holes. surprisingly, for any of the considered dimensions and
topologies, the corrected thermodynamical quantities turn out to coincide
with those calculated within a simplied approach, which uses only the un-
perturbed metric. we obtain the corrected hawking-page transition temper-
ature for black holes with spherical horizons, and show that for p = 3 this
phase transition disappears at a value of  considerably smaller than that
estimated previously by gao and li. using the ads/cft correspondence,
we determine the s1  s3 n = 4 sym phase diagram for suciently large t
hooft coupling, and show that the critical point at which the hawking-page

curs at g2
y m n  20.5. the d = 4 and d = 7 black hole phase diagrams are also
determined, and connection is made with the corresponding boundary cfts.
finally, for at and hyperbolic horizons, we show that the leading stringy or
m-theory corrections do not give rise to any phase transition. however, if the
horizon is compactied to a torus t p or to a quotient of hyperbolic space,
hp/, the appearance of light winding modes around non-contractible cycles
signal new phase transitions, which in the toroidal case have previously been
discussed by barbon et al. . we comment on these phase transitions for sym
on hp/ and on t p, when the moduli of the torus are taken into account.

i. introduction

black holes in anti-de sitter space have turned out to be important tools to study large
n gauge theories. the connection between black hole physics a determine if this curve ends
in a second critical point nd eld theory is provided by the ads/cft correspondence [14],
according to which supergravity on ads spaces (times some compact manifold) is dual to
certain superconformal eld theories. an interesting application of this correspondence was
the observation of witten [3], who interpreted the hawking-page phase transition [5] from
thermal ve-dimensional ads space at low temperature to a schwarzschild-ads black hole
at high temperature, as a phase transition in the corresponding d = 4 super yang-mills
theory in the limit of large t hooft coupling. for the black hole, the free energy scales as
n 2, whereas for thermal ads space, it is of order one. on the yang-mills side, therefore,
the low temperature phase is conning, whereas the high temperature phase is deconning,
the n 2 scaling representing the gluon degrees of freedom. this example feeds the hope that
the ads/cft correspondence nally will help us to understand connement in qcd [6,7]
(cf. also [8] for a review of the present status of the art).
now, for ads black holes, the presence of the negative cosmological constant makes it pos-
sible to circumvent hawkings theorem forbidding non-spherical event horizon topology [9].
as a result, in ads space one can have a large variety of black holes, whose event horizons
are einstein manifolds m with positive, negative, or zero scalar curvature [1016], the latter
arising also as near-horizon limits of certain p-branes in supergravity theories [17]. if the
event horizon is dieomorphic to rp (p-brane solution), witten [3] showed that there is no
hawking-page phase transition, i. e. the system is always in the high temperature (black
hole) phase. this feature was later shown by birmingham [16] to be valid also for hyperbolic
black holes, i. e. for those whose event horizons have negative scalar curvature. according
to the ads/cft dictionary, this means that the corresponding eld theory, which now lives
on s1 m, has no phase transition as a function of the temperature in the large n limit, if
m is hyperbolic or if m  rp. in the rp case, this is immediately clear from the fact that
the circumference  of the s1 factor can be scaled out by conformal invariance, whereas for
spherical black holes, leading to a cft on s1  sp, we can dispose of the circumference 
of sp to form the conformally invariant ratio / [3]. for hyperbolic black holes, however,
the absence of any phase transition at nonzero temperature is not so clear, as the curvature
radius of m provides a characteristic scale.
if one wishes to go beyond the supergravity approximation, in order to study conformal eld
theories on the boundary of ads, one has to calculate stringy corrections (or corrections in
powers of the eleven-dimensional planck length, in the case of m-theory) to the bulk space-
times. this has been done in [18] for the d3-, m2-, and m5-branes. (cf. also [19] for the
case of d3-branes). the motivation for doing so was that the free energy of d = 4 maximally
supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory showed a seeming discrepancy of a factor 3/4 between
the calculations performed by using near-extremal d3-brane geometry, and the weak cou-
pling limit. (actually, this is not a contradiction, because the supergravity approximation
is valid for strong t hooft coupling g2
y m n). the authors of [18] showed that the leading
stringy corrections raise this factor 3/4. as far as the ve-dimensional schwarzschild-ads
black hole is concerned, stringy corrections to the thermodynamics have rst been com-
puted in [20], by using a simplied perturbation theory method. (later, the results of [20]

3

have been conrmed by a calculation of the -perturbed metric [21]). it was shown that
these corrections lower the hawking-page transition temperature. furthermore, the authors
of [20] argued that the hawking-page transition eventually disappears at suciently small
coupling. this would then correspond to a critical point in the sym phase diagram, where
the rst order hawking-page transition degenerates into a higher order phase transition.
that point was conjectured to be identied with the correspondence point of horowitz and
polchinski [22], which (in its simplest version) describes the transition from a highly excited
string state to a black hole, when the characteristic curvature radius at the horizon becomes
of order the string length. the entropy is in fact continuous at this correspondence point,
like in a higher order phase transition. this continuity has been used in [22] to provide a
statistical interpretation of the entropy of schwarzschild black holes by string states.
whereas the previous papers [1821] treat the ve-dimensional case, with event horizon
either dieomorphic to r3 or to s3, we shall extend the computations of stringy- and m-
theory corrections to arbitrary event horizon topology, and also to the dimensions d = 4 and
d = 7. in all cases, we determine the corrected metric, and compare the thermodynamical
quantities obtained in this manner with those obtained by a perturbative approach, which
uses the uncorrected metric. quite interestingly, the corrected black hole entropy and free
energy will turn out to coincide with the corresponding quantities obtained by the pertur-
bative technique. in ve dimensions, this result was already obtained in [18] and [21] for the
case of at or spherical event horizons. it is surprising that it holds also for the hyperbolic
case, which involves the subtraction of a nontrivial background in computing the action.
this background, unlike the ads vacuum used in the spherical or at case, represents an
extremal black hole which itself receives stringy corrections.
furthermore, we shall see that some interesting new features arise, like the emergence of
a stable branch of small spherical black holes. we will determine the behaviour of the
hawking-page transition temperature in function of  for p = 3 (or, alternatively, in func-
tion of g2
y m n). by using a simplied perturbative approach, gao and li [20] were able
to give a rough estimate for the critical value of  at which the hawking-page transition
disappears. by extrapolating the tc = tc() curve to zero temperature, they obtained
crit  0.55l2, where l is the ads5 radius. this value corresponds to g2

y m n  1.65. we
shall see below that a detailed analysis yields a disappearance of the hawking-page transition
crit  0.16l2, corresponding
already at a critical value of  considerably smaller, namely 
to g2
y m n  20.5. in the phase diagram, this gives rise to a critical point (the horowitz-
polchinski correspondence point), at which the rst order transition degenerates to higher
order. besides, we show that there is a second critical value g2
y m n  33.4 in the phase
diagram, at which an additional phase of small black holes appears. taking into account
the dierent black hole or ads phases, we will be able to derive the phase diagram of sym
on s1 s3 for suciently large t hooft coupling. we also determine the phase structures of
the d = 4 and d = 7 spherical black holes in m-theory, relevant for n = 8 sym on s1  s2
and an exotic (0, 2) cft on s1  s5 respectively.
on the other hand, in the hyperbolic case, it will turn out that the stringy corrections do
not lead to the appearance of phase transitions, if the hyperbolic space is simply connected.
if it is compactied, instead, strings can wrap around the non-contractible 1-cycles, and
we shall briey comment on the eect of light winding modes on the modication of the
geometry and the possible appearance of phase transitions. in the at case, m  rp, as

4

already remarked above, there can be no phase transition at any nonzero temperature. this
changes however, if we compactify the rp down to a torus. (for black holes and sym on tori
cf. [23,24]). the implications of these nite size eects on the emergence of phase transitions
have been studied in [25], and we will also give a short comment on the more general case
when the torus is not symmetric, i. e. if one takes into account its moduli.
finally, as further motivation to determine stringy corrections to black holes, we would like
to mention that, apart from the possibility to study the thermodynamics of the correspond-
ing conformal eld theories on the boundary, corrections in  are also interesting on the
black hole (bulk) side, from the point of view of a possible resolution of black hole singular-
ities [26].
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows: to make it self-contained, we be-
gin in section ii by giving a short introduction into the geometry and thermodynamics of
d-dimensional topological black holes. in iii, some ads compactications of string- and m-
theory are reviewed, with emphasis on non-trivial compactications involving hopf bundles
over complex projective spaces. in iv, we give the leading corrections to the supergravity
actions, and use a simple approach involving the unperturbed metric, to calculate the lead-
ing corrections to the black hole free energy and entropy. in section v, the corrected black
hole metrics are determined in the various cases, and in vi the resulting thermodynamical
quantities are discussed and compared with those obtained by the method used in iv. fur-
thermore, the various phase diagrams are determined. in vii, we summarize our results,
and discuss them with regard to conformal eld theories.

ii. geometry and thermodynamics of topological black

holes

one peculiarity of anti-de sitter space consists in the fact that the negative cosmological
constant allows for black holes with non-spherical event horizon topology. the rst works
in the four-dimensional case [1015] have been generalized by birmingham [16] to arbitrary
dimension. the general solution in d dimensions is given by the metric

ds2 = f (r)dt2 + f 1(r)dr2 + r2hij(x)dxidxj,

(1)

where the coordinates are labeled as x = (t, r, xi), i = 1, . . . , d  2, and the metric hij(x)
describes the transverse manifold m(d2). for (1) to be a solution of einsteins equations
with cosmological constant

 = 
the manifold m(d2) must be einstein,

(d  1)(d  2)

,

rij = (d  3)khij,

(2)

(3)

rij denoting the ricci tensor of hij, and k is a constant, which can be restricted to the
values k = 0,1 without loss of generality. k = 1, 0,1 then corresponds to elliptic, at, or
hyperbolic horizons respectively. for the function f , one gets

5

f (r) = k 


rd3 +

r2
l2 ,

(4)

where  is an integration constant, which is related to the black hole mass. note that the
manifold m(d2) is not required to be of constant curvature, it merely has to be einstein.
in d = 6, for instance, we could take m4  s2  s2, which clearly can carry no metric of
constant curvature, but it can carry an einstein metric. if, on the other hand, m(d2) is
of constant curvature (which we will assume in the following, as we want the solution with
 = 0 to be locally anti-de sitter [16] 1), it must be a quotient of sd2, rd2, or hd2 for
k = 1, k = 0, or k = 1 respectively, where hd2 denotes d  2-dimensional hyperbolic
(lobachevsky) space. this means that even in the case k = 1 we are not restricted to the
sphere, but we can also have lens spaces etc.
the spacetime with metric (1) has an event horizon at r = r+, where r+ is the largest root
of f (r) = 0. it is interesting that for k = 1, one can also have black holes for negative
values of the parameter ; the equation f (r) = 0 has positive solutions for

(6)

for k = 1 and  = 0, one has black holes which are locally ads; they represent higher-
dimensional generalizations of the btz black hole 2. the thermodynamics of the black
holes presented above, and their implications on the boundary conformal eld theories have
been examined in [16]. requiring the absence of conical singularities in the euclidean metric

has been compactied; the spacetime with topology r2  hd2 represents ads seen by a uniformly
accelerated observer, with r = r+ = l denoting its acceleration horizon [15].

here vd2 denotes the volume of m(d2), which we assumed to be compact; otherwise one
would have to dene the mass per unit volume. the term proportional to the kronecker
delta in (8) corresponds to the correct choice of background, such that the arnowitt-deser-
misner (adm) mass is a positive, concave function of the black holes temperature [15].
this background is the one with  = 0 (i. e. locally ads) for k = 0, 1, but for k = 1,
one has to choose the extremal black hole with  = 0 as reference background [15]. the
euclidean action reads

in (10) and (11), the horizon radial coordinate r+ can be expressed as a function of the

here the lower sign makes sense only in the spherical (k = 1) case, where two dierent values
of r+ are possible for a given temperature, the branch of small black holes being unstable
[5]. the free energy of the black hole as well as that of the boundary conformal eld theory
is then given by f = i (0)
d /, and is easily seen to scale as vd2t d1 in the limit of high
temperatures, independently of the curvature k. (in the planar case, k = 0, this scaling law
is valid for all temperatures).

iii. topological black holes in string- and m-theory

in this section we shall review how the black holes described above arise as solutions of
the low energy eective actions of m-theory or string theory for special values of d. we shall
rst see how the topological black holes, for d = 4, emerge in low-energy limit of m-theory
and type iia string theory as exact solutions of d = 11, n = 1 supergravity and type iia
supergravity respectively. emparan [17] considered d = 4 topological black holes in their
m-theory context. the solution of the corresponding low-energy eective action, i. e. of
d = 11 supergravity, reads

ds2 = f (r)dt2 + f 1(r)dr2 + r2d2

k + 4l2d2
7

(13)

where f (r) = k  /r + r2/l2, d2
respectively, and d2

k is the metric on s2, the two-torus or h2 for k = 1, 0,1
7 denotes the metric on s7. the four-form eld strength is f =

7

(3/l) , and corresponds to the freund-rubin ansatz for the eleven dimensional manifold.
the associated 3-form potential f = da[3] can be chosen to be at = 3r/l, the other
components being zero. these objects also describe the near-horizon limit of non-extremal
m2-branes wrapped around compact surfaces of genus g  0.
proceeding with a kaluza-klein compactication on a circle of m-theory, one obtains type
iia superstring theory [27]. in particular, compactication of (13) leads to a topological
black hole in type iia supergravity. one observes rst that the odd-dimensional sphere s2n1
can be written as a u(1) bundle over cpn1; it is then possible to perform the kaluza-klein
reduction on the u(1) direction of the hopf bres [28]. hence, we write the s7 factor of the
metric (13) as

d2

7 = d2

6 + (dz + am dzm )2,

(14)

where d2
6 is the standard fubini-study metric on cp3, and the kaluza-klein vector po-
tential a has eld strength f given by f = 2j, where j is the kahler form on cp3. the
coordinate on the ber is z and has period 4, while the coordinates zm , m = 1 . . . 6,
parametrize cp3. we can now compactify m-theory along the s1 direction parametrized by
the coordinate z. the resulting eld conguration will solve the equations of motion of type
iia supergravity; the corresponding metric is described by the line element

ds2

iia = 21/4(cid:18)f (r)dt2 +

dr2
f (r)

+ r2d2

k + 4l2d2

6(cid:19) ,

(15)

and represents a direct product of a four-dimensional black hole and cp3. the dilaton is
constant, and assumes the value  = 3
2 ln 2. the ramond/ramond (rr) one-form a[1]
it is non-vanishing only on cp3,
can be read directly from the mixed components gz;
a[1]m = l am . the remaining elds of iia supergravity, the neveu-schwarz/neveu-schwarz
(nsns) two-form b[2] and the rr three-form c[3], are determined by dimensional reduction
of the three-form a[3] of d=11 supergravity

a[3] = c[3] + b[2]  ldz,

(16)

from which we deduce that the antisymmetric tensor eld b[2] vanishes while the rr three-
form coincides with the three-potential of d=11 supergravity, c[3]t =  3r
l . note that the
compactication of iia supergravity on cp3 breaks some supersymmetry, the reason is that
some killing spinors are described by d0-branes, and the full supersymmetry is restored
only at type iia superstring theory level [29].
modifying slightly the freund-rubin ansatz we obtain seven-dimensional topological black
holes in d=11 supergravity. we ask again the eleven dimensional manifold to be a direct
product m7  m4, but now we take m7 lorentzian and m4 euclidean. we ask the eld f
to be non-vanishing only on m4, where it takes the value fmnpq = (6/l) mnpq. this yields
an einstein space m4 of positive curvature, and we take it to be the four-sphere, which
is maximally symmetric. other choices are possible, at the cost of breaking some of the
supersymmetries. the m7 factor is an einstein space of negative curvature, for example
any of the seven-dimensional topological black holes (1). as a result we have

ds2 = f (r)dt2 + f 1(r)dr2 + r2h(5)

ij (x)dxidxj +

1
4

l2d2
4,

(17)

8

where f (r) = k  /r4 + r2/l2, and h(5)
is the metric of a ve-dimensional compact einstein
space of positive, zero or negative curvature according to the sign of k. observe that we
cannot obtain a seven dimensional black hole in iia supergravity from this solution, because
s4 has even dimension and hence cannot be written as a u(1) bundle.
let us turn now to ve dimensional topological black holes. in type iib supergravity there
is an anti-self-dual ve-form f that can be used for a freund-rubin like ansatz [30]. taking

ij

f1...5 =

4
l

1...5 ,

fm1...m5 = 

4
l

m1...m5,

(18)

and all the other elds zero, the ten-dimensional spacetime becomes the direct product of
a ve-dimensional topological black hole and a ve-dimensional positive curvature einstein
space, which represents a solution of the iib supergravity equations of motion. the metric
reads

ds2 = f (r)dt2 + f 1(r)dr2 + r2h(3)

ij (x)dxidxj + l2 d2
5,

(19)

where f (r) = k  /r2 + r2/l2, and h(3)
einstein space of positive, zero or negative curvature, according to the sign of k.
furthermore, if the compact space is s5, we can untwist it [28], and obtain a ve-dimensional
black hole times a compact space cp2  u(1) as solution of type iia supergravity. let us
see in detail how this works. the sphere s5 is a u(1) bundle over cp2 and its metric is

ij denotes the metric of a three-dimensional compact

ds2(s5) = l2d2

(20)
4 is the metric on the unit cp2, and d a = 2j, j being the kahler form on cp2.
where d2
now, performing a t-duality along z, we obtain a solution of type iia supergravity [31].
the dual metric reads

4 + l2(dz + a)2,

iia = f (r)dt2 + f 1(r)dr2 + r2h(3)
ds2

ij (x)dxidxj + l2d2

4 + l2dz2,

(21)

and is of the form t bh5  cp2  s1. the rr 4-form of iib theory is mapped by t-duality
on the rr 3-form of iia theory

dc[3] = 4l3 4,

(22)

and the kaluza-klein vector component of the ten-dimensional iib metric is mapped on the
2-form b[2] of the nsns sector of iia supergravity,

db[2] = 2l j  dz,

(23)

while the rr 1-form and the dilaton  vanish. observe that cp2 does not admit any spin
structure. as a consequence the spectrum of kaluza-klein excitations in the cp2  s1
compactication of type iia supergravity contains no fermions.
finally, the oxidation of the t bh5  cp2  s1 solution of iia supergravity yields a ve-
dimensional topological black hole solution of d=11 supergravity

f = 4l2 4  2lj  dz1  dz2 ,

4 + dz2

(24)
(25)

which is of the form t bh5  cp2  t 2.
in fact, more general ve-dimensional ads black hole solutions can be found, of the form
t bh5  m6, where m6 is einstein-kahler and f is the product of the kahler form with
in the d = 4, 7 cases one can choose less symmetric compactication spaces,
itself [32].
substituting for example the spheres with lens spaces, or taking other einstein manifolds.
the resulting solutions have less supersymmetries, and could show relevant to study cft
with less than maximal supersymmetry [33].
in conclusion, we have obtained several topological black hole solutions. in d=11 super-
gravity we have t bh4  s7, t bh7  s4 and t bh5  cp2  t 2 black holes, in type iia
supergravity we obtained t bh4  cp3 and t bh5  cp2  s1 black holes, while in iib
supergravity we have the t bh5  s5 black holes.

iv. stringy and m-theory corrections to free energy and

entropy from the unperturbed metric

a. the modied supergravity actions

our aim is to determine eects of massive string states on the black hole geometry. in
the low energy eective action, these massive string states manifest themselves as higher
derivative curvature terms. in type iib supergravity, the lowest correction is of order 3r4,
where r denotes the riemann tensor. taking this into account, the string-corrected iib
supergravity action reads in einstein frame [34,35]3

i10 =

where

(27)

and the dots stand for terms depending on further antisymmetric tensor eld strengths and
dilaton derivatives. due to a eld redenition ambiguity [35,36], there exists a scheme where
w depends only on the weyl tensor,

w = c hmnkcpmnqc rsp

(28)

for eleven-dimensional supergravity, the situation is somewhat dierent, as there is no pa-
rameter  in m-theory. however, there are corrections in powers of the planck length 11,
leading to the eective action (cf. [18] and references therein)

i11 =

(29)

3we impose self-duality of the ve-form eld strength f5 after the equations of motion are derived.

where  = 22/3, and the eleven-dimensional newton constant reads in terms of the planck
length 11

11.

(30)

the term w is again given by (28). for further purpose, it will be useful to dene also in
eleven dimensions an expansion parameter , which is now given by  = 24/3
11 , so that
the w -dependent term in the corrected actions has the prefactor  in both ten and eleven
dimensions.

b. free energy and entropy

in order to get a rst clue of the string- or m-theory corrections to thermodynamical
quantities like free energy or black hole entropy, one can plug the unperturbed metric into
the expression (28), and then calculate the corrected action. this approach corresponds
essentially to rst order perturbation theory. it was used in [18] to calculate  corrections
to the throat approximation of d3-branes, and planck length corrections to that of m2-
and m5-branes, in order to determine the free energy behaviour of conformal eld theories
beyond the supergravity approximation in the ads/cft correspondence. the authors of
[18] showed that in the d3-brane case, this simple procedure yields exactly the same result as
a calculation involving the perturbed metric. for the ve-dimensional k = 1 schwarzschild-
ads black hole, gao and li [20] used the same approach to show that the hawking-page
phase transition temperature is lowered by the rst  correction. later, landsteiner [21]
computed explicitely the perturbed black hole metric, and obtained the same black hole
entropy as that supplied by the perturbative approach of [20]. in section vi we will see
that this coincidence extends also to the hyperbolic case (k = 1), and to the dimensions
d = 4, 7. this result is rather puzzling, and it would be interesting to get a better physical
understanding of it.
in the following, we will calculate the corrected action for the d-dimensional topological
black hole spacetimes (1), where we shall concentrate on the cases d = p + 2 = 4, 5, 7,
corresponding to the well-known ads compactications of m-theory or of type iib string
theory. in calculating the term (28) quartic in the weyl tensor, one actually should take the
full ten- or eleven-dimensional metric, i. e. the product of (1) and the metric on a suitably
chosen sphere. in the case of d3-branes in the throat approximation, the full ten-dimensional
expression for w coincides with the one calculated using only the ve-dimensional part
without ve-sphere [18]. this fact is related to a vanishing scalar curvature of the full
ten-dimensional metric [18]. an argument which justies the use of the p + 2-dimensional
analogue of (28) also in the case of m-branes down the throat, was given in [18]. the same
argument applies also if the branes are wrapped on einstein spaces mp, i. e. in our case.
therefore, in the following, we will use the d = p + 2 dimensional analogue of (28), and
compute it for the metric (1). w is then given by

w = dp+2(cid:20)(d  2)(d  1)

corrections. in doing so, one has to take care of an important subtlety. in the calculation
of the unperturbed action, one performs a subtraction of a suitably chosen background in
order to cancel divergences. now, as already observed in ii, for the cases k = 0 or k = 1
this background is (at least locally) anti-de sitter space, which receives no corrections, as
it has  = 0. for the hyperbolic black hole (k = 1) however, the correct background is
the extremal black hole with  = 0 (cf. (5)). in calculating the corrected action, we must
therefore subtract the background value, which gives a nonvanishing contribution in the
hyperbolic case, as can be seen from (31). in this way, we get

where r+ is a function of the temperature according to (12). the correction to the free energy
is then fd = id/, which again scales as vd2t d1 for high temperatures, independently of
the curvature k. one immediately checks (after adapting the conventions), that for k = 0,
(35) reproduces the results of [18], and for d = 5, k = 1 it reduces to the corrected action
obtained in [20]. we further observe that for k = 0, 1 the correction to the action is always
negative. the entropy correction can be computed by s =  f

note that the k = 1,  = 0 locally ads black holes, which have hawking temperature
t = 1/(2l), do not receive any stringy or m-theory corrections to their entropy up to order
3. (at least not in this simplied calculation, but we shall see later that a computation
involving the perturbed metric gives the same result; besides, for  = 0 the metric does not
receive any corrections). this suggests that maybe they represent exact solutions of string-
or m-theory, similarly to the btz black hole, which has been shown to be an exact solution
of string theory by horowitz and welch [37].

v. corrected black hole metrics

in this section we shall compute the corrections to the metric of the t bh4  s7 and
t bh7  s4 black holes in m-theory and of the t bh5  s5 solution in type iib superstring
theory. we shall proceed in a unied way, leaving the dimension d of the black hole arbitrary,
and carrying out the perturbative expansion in , dened in section iv a.
to compute the perturbed solution, following [18], we write the reduced action for a metric
of the form

ds2 = h(r)2(cid:0)k 2(r) dt2 + p 2(r) dr2 + l2 d2
k(cid:1) ,

where d2
k is the unit metric of the transverse elliptic, at or hyperbolic manifold for k = 1,0
and 1 respectively. using the symmetry of the ansatz, we can reduce the corrected actions
(26) and (29) to one dimension in a unied way, and we obtain the eective action 4

where the expansion parameter  is given in section iv a for iib superstring theory and
m-theory,  is the period in euclidean time, vd2 is the volume of the (unit) transverse
manifold and  is the cosmological constant dened in (2). in the iib supergravity case, the
dilaton  appears in the full action (26). however on the unperturbed solution it vanishes,
and the leading order perturbations of the dilaton do not mix with the metric perturbations.
hence, in computing the corrections to the metric, we shall simply forget about the dilaton;

4for the subtleties concerning the self-duality of f5 in the iib supergravity case, we refer to
[18]. furthermore, a more general ansatz should actually be used, allowing also the radius of the
compactication space to vary [19]. however, in [18] an argument is given that shows that such
a generalization does not yield additional corrections to the free energy; this has been explicitly
veried in some cases in [19,21]. hence we shall use the simplied ansatz with xed compactication
space radius in the following.

13

we shall add some comments on its leading order perturbation at the end of this section.
the invariant w can be computed from the weyl tensor and reads

we look now for rst-order corrections to the metric. to this end, we rst expand the
functions a(r) and b(r) in ,

a(r) = a0(r) + a1(r) + . . . ,

b(r) = b0(r) + b1(r) + . . . ,

turbed ads black holes, solve the equations of motion (44) at zero order in . expanding
the equations to rst order in  and solving them, one nds the o() corrections to the

the integration constants in a1(r) and b1(r) have been chosen such that the corrections
vanish asymptotically, where the corrected metric must match the locally ads metric. fur-
thermore, the position of the horizon is not modied by the corrections, which are nite for
r  r+.
it is interesting to note that the -corrections vanish for  = 0. this becomes plausible
recalling that in this case the spacetimes are (at least) locally ads. using supersymmetry
arguments, it was argued in [38] that ads4  s7, ads7  s4 or ads5  s5 are exact vacua
of m-theory or iib string theory respectively. in the case  = 0, k = 1 these arguments
do not apply anymore, as spacetime represents now a black hole with hawking temperature
t = 1/(2l), if the transverse space hp has been compactied. clearly a black hole with
non-vanishing temperature cannot be supersymmetric [39]. presumably, the  = 0, k = 1
black holes are nevertheless exact solutions of string theory in much the same way as the
btz black hole [37].
finally, in the iib supergravity case, one should also consider the corrections to the dilaton
eld. reducing the complete action (26) to d = 5 dimensions, one obtains the equations of

motion for the leading order corrections 1(r) to the dilaton, (cid:0)g 

corrections to the dilaton can be chosen to be

1(cid:1)  = 3g w , and the

this integral can be performed analytically, but the result is quite complicated and we shall
not need it in the following. in fact, the result can be found in [18] in the k = 0 case and
in [21] for k = 1; in the hyperbolic case the result is quite similar. the relevant point is
that the solution is regular everywhere, and the dilaton, as well as the string coupling gs,
decreases towards the horizon.

15

vi. thermodynamics of the perturbed solution

having now the corrections to the metric, we shall analyse their eects on the thermody-
namics, and compare the corrected free energy with the one obtained from the unperturbed
solution in section iv. the temperature of the perturbed black hole is obtained from the
absence of conical singularities in the euclidean section,

t (r+) =

(52)

the rst term of (52) is the temperature of the unperturbed black hole (7), and the second
term comes from the order  correction to the metric. for the toroidal black hole we have
k = 0 and the temperature reads

tk=0(r+) =

dp+2

48l6 (d  1)3(d  2)2(14  d)(cid:19) + o(2).

(53)

the behaviour of the temperature as a function of the position of the horizon remains linear,
but the coecient is increased by the -corrections. in the spherical and hyperbolic cases,
the temperature approaches asymptotically (53).
one can invert (52) and obtain the black hole radius r+ as a function of the temperature t .
we use the unperturbed radius r+(0) dened in (12) as

r+(0)(t ) =

2l2t

d  1 (cid:2)1 + 1  x(cid:3) ,

where x is given by (37). the radius of the horizon is then5

(54)

(55)

we now wish to compute the corrected euclidean action of the black hole, as well as the
corrected free energy. as usual in ads space, the surface terms of the action do not con-
tribute, but there is an infrared divergence coming from the bulk contribution. this is
regularized setting a cut-o in the radial integration and subtracting the action of an ap-
propriate background. as mentioned in section ii, in the spherical and toroidal cases the
appropriate background is the metric with  = 0. we have shown that this background
receives no correction. however, in the hyperbolic case, the question in the hyperbolic case

5in the k = 1 case, r+(t ) describes only the branch of larger black holes.

16

is more subtle, as its background (5) gets corrections in . in fact, as can be readily veried
from eq. (52), its formal temperature becomes negative. the right background to subtract
is the one whose corrected temperature (52) vanishes. the position of the horizon of this
corrected black hole is obtained setting t = 0 in eq. (55),

r+(t = 0) = lr d  3

dp+2

the regularized action then reads

ireg = i(r)  i0(r),

(56)

(57)

where i0(r) is the action evaluated on the appropriate background with the radial cut-o
at r. the periodicity in the euclidean time of the background  must match that of the
black hole, in such a way that the proper length of the circle which it parametrizes at radius
r is the same as for the black hole [3]. this yields

(0  )l2
2r(d1) + o(cid:18) 1

(58)

at this point, we can safely eliminate the cut-o from (57) by sending r to innity, obtaining
the black hole action

the corrected action (59), written in function of r+, does not coincide with the expression
(35) + (10), obtained in a naive way. however, the free energy as a function of the tem-
perature computed from the perturbed metric coincides with that obtained from (35), as
was rst observed in the cases d = 5, k = 0 in [18] and d = 5, k = 1 in [21]. as a con-
sequence, also the correction to the entropy obtained from the perturbed metric coincides
with the correction (36) computed from the unperturbed metric. this fact is particularly
surprising in the k = 1 case, where the background used in the regularization receives itself
modications, and the subtraction has been done with respect to a dierent background.

17

we now want to use the obtained thermodynamical quantities to determine the phase
diagram, which is also relevant for the corresponding superconformal eld theory via the
ads/cft dictionary. to begin with, we study the case d = 5, k = 1, which corresponds to
sym on s1  s3. in order to translate our results from the bulk to the sym side, we will
make use of the relation


l2 = (2g2

(61)

a rst important thermodynamical information is obtained observing the behaviour of the
inverse temperature  in function of the black hole size r+. the function (r+) has been
plotted for dierent values of the string perturbation  in gure 1. we immediately see that

there exists a stable black hole corresponding to each value of the temperature, whereas
in the unperturbed case there was a minimum temperature. this is due to the emergence
of a stable branch of small black holes in the perturbed solution. furthermore, there is

18

a minimum size rmin
for stable black holes, where the temperature vanishes. for small
, the small black holes are separated from the large black holes by a branch of unstable
intermediate black holes. at inf l  0.0004 the unstable branch degenerates to a point of
inection of (r+), and for larger  the two stable branches merge together and no more
distinction can be made beetween the small and large black hole phases. all this reminds us
of the behaviour of a van der waals gas in the clapeyron (v, p ) plane; and one could expect
the point of inection in (r) to signal a critical point. to go into this we have however
to study the behaviour of the free energy, and take into consideration that in our system a
third phase  ads space lled with thermal radiation  is available. for charged ads black
holes, an analogous behaviour has recently been observed in [40,41].
in gure 2 we have reported the free energy of the perturbed solution as a function of

existence of a third phase, ads space, and disappears denitively only at crit

shall deduce the phase structure of our system. the graphs of f (t ) for dierent values of

with thermal radiation at low temperatures, and a phase dominated by large black holes
at high temperatures, separated by the hawking-page transition. for crit

new phase transition appears at low temperatures, separating a low-temperature phase of
small black holes from an intermediate-temperature ads phase. at high temperatures we
have the hawking-page transition and again the large black holes dominates. note that
the critical temperature of this transition is lowered by -corrections, as rst shown in [20].
finally, at crit
the ads phase disappears completely, and for higher  we have a unique
phase dominated by black holes. note that for  > crit
the distinction between small and
large black holes disappears; the system behaves like a liquid-vapour system. in the critical

phase transition disappears; this point has been identied by gao and li with the horowitz-
polchinsky correspondence point in [20]. the phase structure is summarized in the phase
diagram of gure 4. we stress the fact that the critical values crit
are very small
(of the order of 104); as a consequence there should be no further signicant correction
of higher order in  in the region of the phase diagram we explored. on the n = 4 sym
side, one has the correspondence point at g2
y m n  20.5, which is considerably larger that
the value 1.65 obtained by gao and li. the reason is that they extrapolated the (steep)
hawking-page transition curve to zero temperature, whereas we showed that this curve is
interrupted by the intersection with the coexistence curve of small black holes and ads space
at a much smaller value of . hence, in the sym theory, the higher order phase transition
is located at a value of the t hooft coupling where we have a better control on the large n
expansion.

we shall turn now to the d = 4 and d = 7 cases. the analysis of their thermodynamical
behaviour can be carried over as in the d = 5 case; as no further technical problems arise,
we shall not report it here and instead discuss simply their phase structure.

lled with thermal radiation. the low temperature phase is separated by a rst order phase
transition from an ads phase. the coexistence curve small black hole/ads terminates in
the origin  = 0, t = 0. at higher temperature we have the hawking-page phase transition
between ads and a phase dominated by a large black hole. observe that the hawking-page
temperature remains approximately constant as  grows. at crit
iii  3.07  105 the two
coexistence curves intersect for t  0.32/l in a triple point. for higher  we are left with a
small/large black hole phase separation curve, which continues more or less at the original
hawking-page transition temperature; this curve could end in a second critical point like
in the phase diagrams studied in [40], but in our perturbative approach we are not able
to clarify this issue. from the ads/cft point of view, gure 5 corresponds to the phase
structure of n = 8 super-yang mills theory on s1  s2 with global so(8) r-symmetry, in
the limit of suciently large n.
the seven-dimensional black hole case is somewhat dierent; ads space always dominates
over the small black hole. for this system, the phase diagram is drawn in gure 6. for
small  we have a low temperature ads phase separated by a hawking-page transition

phase remains. from the boundary conformal eld theory point of view, the spherical
seven-dimensional ads black hole in m-theory compactied on a four-sphere corresponds
to an exotic six-dimensional theory with (0, 2) supersymmetry. the at analogue of this
theory is particularly interesting; witten [3] suggested that with a supersymmetry-breaking
compactication to four dimensions it may be possible to explore four-dimensional su(n)
yang-mills theory in the large n limit; this theory was therefore considered one of the main
approaches to connement in qcd.

finally, for the hyperbolic or at cases, k = 1 or k = 0, one checks that the corrected
free energy f (t ) is always negative for positive t ; it is zero only for the background, i. e. the
extremal black hole with t = 0. this means that the (deconning) black hole phase domi-
nates for all temperatures, also if one takes the leading stringy (or eleven-dimensional planck
length) corrections into account. so these do not cause any phase transition. however, if
the transverse manifold (i. e. hp for k = 1 and rp for k = 0) is compactied, it supports

non-contractible 1-cycles around which strings can wind. when the length of these cycles
become comparable to the string scale s, the winding modes become very light, and we
expect the geometry to be modied. now for the hyperbolic black hole there is a minimum
horizon radius r0 given by (6). the length of the noncontractible cycles in general depend
on several parameters, like the moduli and genus in the case of a compact riemann surface
(p = 2). if we neglect for the moment this dependence and suppose those lengths to be of
order one, light winding modes become important for r0  s, which gives a rather large
value of . the behaviour is dierent for the toroidal black hole however, as here the hori-
zon radius can become arbitrarily small, it shrinks to zero size in the extremal case t = 0.
so light winding modes can modify the geometry already for small values of . these nite
size eects have been discussed in [25]. let us take a short look on what happens when the
moduli of the torus are taken into account. as a model we take the (uncorrected) black hole
metric in iib supergravity,

and x, y, z  [0, 1]. for the sake of simplicity, we restrict ourselves to one complex modulus
 . the fundamental cycles in x or z direction have length 1, while those in y direction
have length ||. winding modes along x, z then become important for r+  s, and winding
modes along y for r+  s/||. note that these two lengths can dier considerably, if ||  1
or ||  1. let us assume e. g. the latter case. then for r  s/|| one should go over to a
t-dual language (t-duality along y). the crossover temperature is

t2  t  t1, and t > t1, one now has to examine the thermodynamic stability of the
corresponding manifold, as has been done in [25] for  = i, i. e. for t1 = t2. in this case,
the authors of [25] argued that there is a phase transition at a temperature

below which the dual xbh of the black hole manifold xbh (62), which represents a system of
d0-branes smeared over the torus t 3 (cf. [25] for the t-dual metric), goes over to a system of
d0-branes localized on the t 3. this phase transition is the toroidal analogue of the hawking-
page transition which occurs for spherical black holes. if the modulus || is very dierent

24

from i (so that e. g. t1  t2), we expect a more complicated phase diagram, showing
perhaps more than one phase transition. (a full thermodynamical discussion involving the
determination of the phase diagram would go beyond the scope of this paper, so we leave
this issue for future investigations).
in particular, we expect a rather complicated phase
diagram in the moduli space of the torus.

vii. summary and discussion

in the present paper, we computed stringy or m-theory corrections to d-dimensional
anti-de sitter black holes for d = 4, 5, 7. thereby we allowed for spherical, at or hyperbolic
event horizons. in order to obtain the corrections to the black hole thermodynamics, we
rst used a simplied perturbative approach, which consists in plugging the unperturbed
metric into the term quartic in the weyl tensor appearing in the modied supergravity
action. then also the corrected black hole metrics have been determined explicitely in the
various cases. quite surprisingly, the resulting thermodynamical quantities, like free energy
or entropy, coincide with those obtained by the above mentioned simplied approach. this
coincidence holds for all values of d and for all event horizon topologies under consideration.
especially in the hyperbolic case, this agreement is remarkable, as the calculation of the
action for hyperbolic black holes involves a nontrivial background subtraction. for black
holes with at or hyperbolic event horizons, we found that the rst stringy or m-theory
corrections do not give rise to any phase transition, the system is in the black hole phase
for any temperature. if the spatial black hole geometry supports noncontractible 1-cycles,
i. e. if one compacties the rp or the hp, we have winding modes which become very light
if the length of these 1-cycles is of order the string scale. then we expect the geometry to
be modied. for hyperbolic black holes, which have a minimum event horizon radius of the
order the ads scale l, these winding modes in general become light only for a large value of
. (taking into account the moduli of the compact space could change this behaviour, but
we did not consider them here). for toroidal black holes however, there is no minimum event
horizon radius, so already for small values of  light winding modes can become important.
as these nite size eects have already been discussed in [25] for symmetric tori, we limited
ourselves to a short discussion of the nonsymmetric case, indicating the appearance of a
rather complicated phase diagram.
as for spherical black holes, which are relevant to study sym on s1  sp, we showed that
the stringy or m-theory corrections give rise to the emergence of a stable branch of small
black holes. by considering the free energy, the corresponding sym phase diagram has
been determined for d = 5 in the limit of suciently large t hooft coupling, where the
restriction to the o(3) corrections is valid. the phase diagram shows that the hawking-
page transition temperature decreases with increasing string scale, and nally disappears
at a value of g2
y m n  20.5, which is considerably larger than the estimate given by gao
and li [20]. this critical point in the phase diagram has been identied by the authors of
[20] with the correspondence point of horowitz and polchinski. we found that there is a
second critical value of the t hooft coupling in the s1  s3 sym phase diagram, namely
g2
y m n  30.4. above this value, we have the conning phase of thermal ads space for low
temperatures and the deconning black hole phase for suciently high temperatures. for

25

20.5 < g2
y m n < 30.4, one has a phase of small black holes for low temperatures, an ads
phase in an intermediate temperature regime, and nally a phase of large black holes for
high temperatures. for g2
y m n < 20.5, the system is always in the black hole phase; besides,
the small and large black holes have become indistinguishable. the d = 4 black hole,
corresponding to n = 8 sym on s1  s2, has a somewhat dierent phase structure. the
phase of small black holes now already appears for any nonzero value of . furthermore,
the critical point is a triple point. above it, no ads phase appears, but there is still a
small/large black hole phase transition. finally, for d = 7 (corresponding an exotic (0, 2)
cft on s1  s5), there is no small black hole phase, and the ads phase is located in the
region of small temperatures and small values of .
