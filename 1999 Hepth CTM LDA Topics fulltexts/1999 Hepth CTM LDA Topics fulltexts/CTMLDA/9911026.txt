(2.2) straightforward show operations satisfy ha conditions. h may thought algebra operators h dene (left) action x h f h, denoted x f , x f := f(1)(cid:10)x, f(2)(cid:11) . 2 (2.3) since easy show (xy)f = x(yf ), indeed action elements h h, thus gives representation h h module. furthermore, sort leibniz rule: x (f g) = (x(1) f )(x(2) g). give h interpretation, notice p0(x) := x (x)1 p1(x) := (x)1 projections h, h = ker k1. note x ker , x 1 = 0, may thought derivatives h; elements k1 multiply elements h elements k. finally, concept derivatives h, x ker . dene integral h linear mapr : h k thatr x f = 0 quasitriangular hopf algebra ha h special invertible element r h h, called r-matrix, properties ( ) (f ) = r (f ) r1, ( id) (r) = r13r23, (id) (r) = r13r12, (2.4) : f g 7 g f subscripts r latter two tell pieces h3 r lives, i.e. r = r r (sum implied), r13 := r 1 r. one consequence properties r-matrix fact must satisfy yang-baxter equation (ybe) r12r13r23 = r23r13r12.

(note: brevitys sake, omit speaking action partial derivative function x.) 3 *-product motivated previously-mentioned literature noncommuting strings, use formalism presented introduce new *-product hopf algebra h. examine properties, go show non- commutative product string theory particular case multiplication. 3.1 formal denition *-product suppose two dually paired h h, suppose r-matrix h. thus dene new operation : hh h terms r usual multiplication h via f g := f(1)g(1)(cid:10)r21, f(2) g(2)(cid:11) . (3.1) (if h trivially quasitriangular, f g = f g.) operation actually associative consequence ybe. see explicitly, pick f, g, h h, rst compute (f g) h: (f g) h = (cid:0)f(1)g(1)(cid:10)r21, f(2) g(2)(cid:11)(cid:1) h = f(1)g(1)h(1)(cid:10)r21, f(2)g(2) h(2)(cid:11)(cid:10)r21, f(3) g(3)(cid:11) = f(1)g(1)h(1)(cid:10)r32r31r54, f(2) g(2) h(2) f(3) g(3)(cid:11) = f(1)g(1)h(1)(cid:10)r32r31r21, f(2) g(2) h(2)(cid:11) . (3.2) 4 (f g) = (cid:0)f g(1)(cid:1)(cid:10), g(2)(cid:11) = f(1)g(1)(cid:10), f(2)g(2)(cid:11)(cid:10), g(3)(cid:11) = f(1)g(1)(cid:10) () , f(2) (cid:0)g(2)(cid:1)(cid:11) , (3.3) going fron rst line second, used coassociativity ; next, third (2.2), second (2.4) relabelling indices stick everything one inner product; last step used rst (2.2). calculate f (g h), exactly analogous compution gives result left argument inner product replaced r21r31r32, using ybe (with rst third tensor spaces swapped), nd algebra constructed (the vector space) h *-multiplication two quantities exactly same. hence, (f g) h = f (g h) bh, associative. since turns 1 f = f 1 = f , bh unital well. mutative, bh may r21 6= r. examine bit more, shown ten terms , *-product becomes f g = f g + f(1)g(1)(cid:10)21, f(2) g(2)(cid:11). general noncommutative multiplication: even h com- dening relations r imply ( id) (r) = (id) (r) = 11, may dene new quantity ker ker := r11. writ- suppose dene compute (f g): last step split f(2)g(2) get coproduct . third (2.4) terms (id) () = 13 + 12 + 1312; use argument inner product, nd this, get rid (cid:0)g(2)(cid:1) exchanging multiplication h (f g) = f(1)g(1)(cid:10)21 + (1 )r21, f(2) g(2)(cid:11) , := . let us suppose kind tracelessness con- dition , vanishes. must stress purely assumption, fact hold, conclude (3.4) f g = f g + (f g) , (3.5) words, f g f g dier total derivative, since ker . follows integralr dened h,r f g =r f g. comment above: easily extended case n n matrix-valued hopf algebra, i.e. h mn (k), case *-product includes matrix multiplication well: (f g)i j. note quantum group, since h thought set functions group manifold. thus, take coproducts et al., matrix part unaected. k gk j = f also, *-product unique: r21 replaced r1, new * still associative, results also follow suitable modications. case ha triangular, r21 = r1 denition, two dierent *-products coincide. 5 3.2 noncommutative string theory recently {$9711165$}, shown one considers open strings dp- branes space metric gij constant nonvanishing neveu-schwarz 2-form bij (i, j = 0, . . . , p), theory reformulated sym theory space coordinates longer commute, instead satisfy deformed relation xi xj xj xi = iij, ij := (2)2(cid:18) 1 g + 2b b 1 g 2b(cid:19)ij . (3.6) (3.7) generally, shown f (x) g(x) (matrix-valued) functions, noncommutative product two functions f (x) g(x) f (x) g(x) := e 2 ij j f (x + )g(x + )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0 . (3.8) action expressed sym form provided ordinary multi- plications replaced *-product, closed string metric gij replaced open string metric gij := gij (2)2(cid:0)bg1b(cid:1)ij gauge eld ai replaced bai, depends ai (and derivatives) ij . compare (3.8) (3.1), suggests candidate r-matrix r = e 2 ij ij , (3.9) must make sure satises appropriate relations. since f commutative, (i) symmetric, evident rst (2.4) satised. check second (2.4), note ky=1 i! =x xk 1 !(k )! i(1) . . . i() i(+1) . . . i(k) , (3.10) permutation (1, . . . , k). therefore, ( id) (r) = = (i)k 2kk! ypk ipjp yk yqk xk=0 2kk!!(k )!ypk ipjpx ym=1 xk=0xk i(n)! yqk jq kyn=+1 (i)k jq i(m) 6 = (i) 2! yp x=0 jn in! yqk kyn=+1 ipjp ip xk jq , (i)k 2k(k )! (3.11) last step switched sums k , also used commutativity partial derivatives third tensor space get rid (picking k! process). split product third space two, one 1 + 1 k, let k = r, get ( id) (r) = n j n n (i)+r 2+r!r!yp ipjp ip ynr x,r=0 yq q jq yqr 2!

(3.8) holds almost denition, since, (3.1), f g simply product action rst tensor space r21 f action second g. r also satises tracelessness condition: subtract 1 1 r21 multiply two tensor product spaces together, immediately get , evidently zero due asymmetry (and constancy) ij 7 commutativity partial derivatives, f g f g dier total deriva- tive. since original multiplication commutative begin with, r tr (f g) =r tr (g f ). 4 noncommutative gauge theories make comments noncommutative gauge theories may may relate has. 4.1 algebraic structure section 2.2, showed commutative case, ha structure functions derivatives rp+1. however, even though noncom- zero. commutator iij 1, contradiction. therefore, associative, deformed derivative. certainly dene inner product two spaces, due lack coproduct real surprise. rst place, requirements necessary space ha restrictive, general reason mutative bf associative unital algebra, ha, seen following: proved, unit f unit bf , bf ha counitb, fact counit homomorphism bf c meansb(1) = 1. now, consider xi xj xj xi; counit map bf cannot ha. expect arbitrary algebra also ha. furthermore, although bf coalgebra structure (a counit coproduct) due fact bf unital bf , action bf it, thus concept derivative. noncommutative sym eld strength, via bfij =  iba {$9711165$}; however, although interpretation elements bf objects local action bf , might still possible interpret nonlocal operators. illustration this, consider case 2-dimensional quantum hyperplane: coordinates x, generate algebra (the functions plane) modulo commutation relation xy = qyx, derivatives x, act function f (x, y) (ordered xs appear left ys) deformed derivative available, would natural choice, case. borne fact must use ordinary partial derivative dene xf (x, y) = yf (x, y) = f (q2x, y) f (x, y) , (q2 1) x f (q2x, q2y) f (q2x, y) (q2 1) , (4.1) 8 q r {$9803044$}. note q 1, become ordinary derivatives, otherwise nonlocal dierence operators. string case could simi- lar, ij playing role ln q. granularisation spacetime might explain absence small instanton singularities  noncommuting theory, smearing objects one point. 4.2 gauge fields hopf algebras fact *-product dened terms abstract ha in- cludes noncommutative string theory case hints possibility describ- ing entire theory using quasitriangular ha, r-matrix depends ij . however, certainly sucient, since considered gauge eld bai. also addressed matter map ai 7 bai allow us cast action sym form. address issues. ij inherently ha parameter; appears r-matrix therefore describes ha structure f f . seen either explicitly, relation ( )(x) = r(x)r1 h, via commutation relations elements h, may expressed gf =(cid:10)r, f(1) g(1)(cid:11) f(2)g(2) (cid:10)r1, f(3) g(3)(cid:11) . (4.2) so, motivated facts, therefore seems reasonable conjecture -dependence theory ha structure f f . true, -dependence noncommuting theory must arise underlying ha describing commutative theory. gives us bit information gauge elds: know change variables gauge elds two theories involves {$9711165$}, means sort ha-derived operation involved going one other. since, must element w f given ha properties (coproduct, etc.) ha structure f (as vector space) leads conclusion w independent , thus must related ai, since gauge eld ij = 0 case. also assume dependence open string metric gij constructing lorentz-invariant quantities proved previous section, noncommutative algebra bf ha, related ai bai. assumption -dependence integral, e.g. r dp+1xggij ij, w also g-independent. writing, know precisely element might be, natural candidate would wilson line (which explains call w ): recall wilson line wc(x0,x) given wc(x0,x) := peir c(x0,x) a, (4.3) c (x0, x) path going x0 x. depends gauge eld commutative theory, independent g, ts criteria 9 proposed w must relate gauge elds ha-dependent way, independent . relation wc ai multiplication f , wc written path-ordered exponential well, outlined. might also able obtain bai following way: via path-ordered exponent. could therefore dene bai function time using *-product instead (denotedbe). words, = 1 + izc(x0,x) ba zc(x0,x) ba zc(x0,x1) ba! + . . . wc(x0,x) = pbe ir c(x0,x) ba (4.4) condition (4.5) ij pbe ir c(x0,x) ba = 0 would give dierential equation involving bai, ij wc , could presumably solve nd bai function ij (derivatives of) ai. rst calculations show enough similarities rst equation (3.5) {$9711165$} encouraging. gauge transformation, idea applies: nite transforma- tion wc given unitary matrix u (x) = ei(x) gives u (x)wc(x0,x)u 1 (x0). started wc terms * bai, transformed u expressed terms * new matrixb via u =be ib. solving (4.6) would obtain second (3.5) {$9711165$}. ij hbe ib(x) ir c(x0,x) ba ib(x0)i = 0, sought-after w f could related wilson loop wc , even though claim oered anything vague justication feeling. said anything ha properties w (although ha enters going e be, via *), said curve c (x0, x) would chosen, since taken completely arbitrary. perhaps importantly, considered action might function w (and r) ultimately end sym form go noncommuting spacetime. regardless, enough evidence consider wilson line guess reasonable. everything done specic case noncommu- tative string, started commutative space (rp+1); formulating ha language propose would also way coming gauge theories original space might noncommutative. steps direction made gauge group (and possibly also space- time) deformed {$9711162$}, may mean hope success present problem. 10 5 conclusions shown product appearing noncommutative string theory simply specic case one may dened terms quasitriangular ha. fact lead us speculate may possible relate arbitrary noncommutative gauge theory quasitriangular ha way, commented ways may done. hope address possibility future work. acknowledgements would like thank lochlainn raifeartaigh, jan pawlowski jorg teschner helpful comments, suggestions advice. 11
