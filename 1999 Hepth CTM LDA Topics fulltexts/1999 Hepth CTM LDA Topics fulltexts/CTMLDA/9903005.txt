(2.15) 9 bundle w = r. computation tr (1)f theory made easily case r n relatively prime, instance r = 1. (the computation done r using relation wzw model su (n)/zn, along lines section 2.1 above, explicitly using techniques section 3.) idea simply  zero energy quantum states obtained, weak coupling, quantizing space zero energy classical states (including possible bosonic fermionic zero modes). zero energy classical conguration gauge elds connection. r n relatively prime, connection pair matrices u v obeying (2.15) unique gauge transformation. moreover, expanding around connection, bosonic fermionic zero modes. hence, quantization straightforward: quantizing unique, isolated classical state zero energy, zero modes, gives unique quantum state.6 index therefore 1 (with sign possibly depending choice sign denition operator (1)f ). note k plays role argument. hence, k su (n)/zn theory exists, theory, formulated bundle r prime n, supersym- metric vacuum state volume t2. taking limit innite volume, follows su (n)/zn theory, k, zero vacuum energy hence unbroken supersymmetry. innite volume, su (n) su (n)/zn theories equivalent.7 hence k su (n)/zn theory dened, su (n) theory unbroken supersymmetry. disprove hypothesis su (n) theory spontaneously broken supersymmetry gap, |k| < n/2? fact, elegant escape describe. allowed values k determined su (n) requiring (1)n exp(2ik) (2.16) 6 actually potential subtlety statement, though inessential examples discussion. one must verify one state question obeys gausss law, words invariant gauge symmetries left unbroken classical solution quantized. 7 except questions operators one chooses probe by; questions irrelevant present purposes. 10 equal 1 integer values instanton number . (we rewritten (2.13) using fact h = n su (n).) su (n)/zn, crucial dierence: instanton number necessarily integer, takes values z/n .

(2.17) thus, su (n)/zn, k cannot gap |k| < n/2, behavior su (n)/zn theory nite volume cannot used exclude hypothesis gap supersym- metry dynamically broken. though prove supersymmetry broken gap su (n), elegant escape suggest right interpretation. 3. microscopic computation index section, make microscopic computation tr (1)f n = 1 supersymmetric pure gauge theory three spacetime dimensions. consider rst case gauge group g simply connected. thus formulate theory spatial torus t2 (times time) look zero energy states. , computation done born-oppenheimer approxi- mation, quantizing space classical zero energy states, valid weak coupling small volume t2. exact, work torus radius r, let e k denote, before, gauge chern-simons couplings. particles momentum t2 energies order 1/r, fermion gauge boson bare mass e2k. work region e2k << 1 r .
