abstract

we investigate the stability of the hidden sector gaugino condensate in
a sl(2,z)-invariant supergravity model inspired by the e8e8 heterotic
string, using the chiral supereld formalism. we calculate the planck-
suppressed corrections to the truncated approximation for the conden-
sate value and the scalar potential. a transition to a phase with zero
condensate occurs near special points in moduli space and at large com-
pactication radius. we discuss the implications for the t-modulus de-
pendence of supersymmetry-breaking.

1 introduction

dynamical supersymmetry-breaking via gaugino condensation [1] in a hidden sec-
tor is a major component of realistic supergravity unied theories. in heterotic
string theory with gauge group e8e8, the second e8 factor provides a suitable
hidden sector [2] with one or more conning gauge groups (depending on the de-
tails of symmetry-breaking). assuming weak coupling at unication, the gauge
coupling will become strong at an energy scale1   e1/2bg2
x , where gx is the
unied gauge coupling and b is the one-loop beta function coecient dened such
that (g) = bg3 + . . . . the vacuum expectation value of the gaugino bilinear
htri switches on with a value of the order of 3, breaking local supersymme-
try. supersymmetry-breaking is mediated by the dilaton and moduli superelds
s, ti
in the four-dimensional supergravity eective theory: the auxiliary elds
f s and f ti take values of the order of hi, the at scalar potential for s and
ti is lifted and supersymmetry is broken softly in the visible sector [3, 4].
it has has usually been assumed that the condensate is well described by the
globally supersymmetric yang-mills theory, since the connement scale is well
below mp .
in the limit of global supersymmetry mp  , the condensate
its value is determined in the eective

superpotential approach [5], where the gaugino bilinear is the lowest component
of the composite chiral supereld u = trw w, by setting the auxiliary eld
fu = ( wnp/ u ) to zero, where wnp is the nonperturbative superpotential
generated by the gauge dynamics. the connection with supergravity models is via
the value of the gauge coupling at unication, which is determined by the vacuum
expectation values of the dilaton and moduli. the same condensate value follows
from minimising the scalar potential in supergravity if higher-order terms in u
are neglected [7, 8]: we call this the truncated approximation. the resulting
condensate value is substituted back into the nonperturbative superpotential,
which is then a function of the dilaton and moduli only and serves as an eective
source of supersymmetry-breaking [7, 9, 10].

if the gravitational corrections to the truncated approximation are signi-
cant, there will be eects on supersymmetry-breaking, on the stabilization of the
dilaton and moduli, and on cosmological ination models which use gaugino con-
densation to provide a positive potential [11, 12]. the size of corrections is found
by minimising the eective action, including gravitationally-suppressed terms,
along the condensate direction. lalak et al. [13] used a similar approach to take
into account the backreaction of other elds on the condensate. our analy-
sis diers from theirs, since we assume a dierent mechanism for stabilizing the
dilaton, we set all superpotential terms which do not depend on the condensate
to zero, and we will be interested mainly in the eects on the compactication
moduli of string theory, rather than on the dilaton.

2 eective action for the gaugino condensate

the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the gaugino bilinear is determined by the
scalar component of u at the stationary point of the eective action (u, s, ti) as
dened by burgess et al. [14], where u is now the classical eld which represents
the expectation value of the composite operator tr(w w ). for a single conning
gauge group with no matter, the condensate is formally described by the eld
u  u/s3
0, where u = htrw wi and w  is the gauge eld strength chiral
supereld. the chiral compensator supereld s0 is introduced to simplify the
formulation of supergravity coupled to matter [15] in the superconformal tensor
calculus2. the gaugino bilinear htri is then the lowest component of u
( =  = 0).
the eective action (u, s, ti) is constructed as a n = 1 supergravity action,
with a superpotential and kahler potential which can be found by considering
the symmetries of the underlying theory and the corresponding anomalies [5, 14].
in the case of a single overall modulus, t1 = t2 = t3  t , the superpotential is

wnp(u, s, t ) =

where fgk(s, t ) is the gauge kinetic function, equal to s at tree level, which
depends on the modulus t through string loop threshold corrections [16], and c

that the einstein term in the lagrangian is canonically normalised [14].

where (s)  e3s/2b and h(t ) is a function with appropriate transformation prop-
erties under the sl(2,z) target-space duality group [17, 18]. the condensation
scale c is dened to be

c  es/2b1/3(ch(t ))1/3.

changing the value of c is equivalent to changing the unied gauge coupling
or the beta-function. in principle c could be determined, if fgk is known, by
comparing the resulting condensation scale with the vev of tr(w w) derived
from instanton calculations in global susy [19](compare [17]).

the kahler potential was determined in [14] as

is the perturbative string tree-level kahler potential, and  is an real constant
of order 1; we will show that the value of  does not aect our results. this
expression for k is also valid at one loop if the green-schwarz anomaly cancella-
tion coecients gs are neglected: we set gs = 0 for simplicity. the expression
(5) can be generalised to include stringy nonperturbative eects [20] which have
been invoked in order to stabilise the dilaton [21]: we replace (5) by

k = p (y)  3 ln(t + t ).

where p (y) is a real function of y  (s + s). the dilaton dynamics will enter
in the eective action only through the auxiliary eld f s, so we do not need to
specify the form of p (y); however, we require p (y) > 0 for the dilaton kinetic
term to have the right sign.

note that k becomes ill-dened for (9/)e k/3(u u )1/3  1.

it is not sur-
prising that the eective action for u breaks down in this limit, since it means
that the condensate forms at the string scale and the gauge group is strongly-
coupled at unication. this limitation has implications for the behaviour of the
condensate at large re(t ), which will be discussed later.

the supergravity action is invariant under target-space sl(2,z) transforma-
tions [22, 23] if the superpotential transforms as a modular form3 of weight 3.
the modulus t transforms as

where a, b, c, d are integers satisfying ad  bc = 1. then u must transform as

u  u (ict + d)3u,

(7)

where u is a (eld-independent) complex phase, and the function h(t ) trans-
forms as h(t )   1
u (ict + d)3h(t ). the u-dependent part of the kahler po-
tential is then modular invariant. in order to avoid singularities inside the fun-
damental domain of sl(2,z), h(t ) must be of the form

h(t ) = 6(t )/h

(8)

where (t ) is the dedekind eta function and h is a constant or a modular
invariant function of t without singularities [10].

the part of (u, s, t ) relevant to nding the value of the condensate is the

scalar potential, which is given as usual by

v = ek((ki w + wi)(k 1)i

j(k jw + w j)  3|w|2).

the indices i and j range over the scalar components of u, s and t (from now
on these symbols will denote the scalar components rather than the superelds),
x i  x/i and xi  x/ i (where x is any function of the scalars and
their complex conjugates), and k 1 is dened by (k 1)i

and we have absorbed a factor of (9/)3/2 into the constant c. the only depen-
dence on  of the potential (9) is in the overall scale, which has no eect on the
existence or stability of minima, so we set 9/ = 1 from now on.

the potential depends on the phase of z only through the rst term inside
the brackets. if we hold |z| xed and vary the phase, a minimum can only occur
when the argument of the logarithm (c(s)h(t )e k/3z3) is real and positive.
the condensate phase arg(z) is then aligned with arg(h(t )1/3) [17], for c and
(s) real. the dependence of the potential on |z| is then determined by two real
parameters, |c(s)h(t )|e k/2 and c2.
the truncated approximation amounts to minimising (9) in the rigid super-
symmetry limit where mp  , (s)  , z  0 and c2 is held constant.
the rst term inside the bracket then dominates the dependence on z and there
is a zero-value minimum with unbroken supersymmetry satisfying w/u = 0

which has been argued to occur independently of any particular supersymmetry-

3 beyond the truncated approximation

returning to local supersymmetry, when c2|z|2 is non-zero, z = ztr is not a
minimum of the scalar potential and we cannot invoke the condition that the
hidden sector gauge dynamics preserve supersymmetry. for small c2|z|2, the
truncated value is a good approximation; however, we would like to nd the
size of corrections, and to investigate the behaviour of the potential when the
truncated approximation fails.

figure 1 shows the eect on the potential as a function on |z| of varying c2
while keeping |ztr| xed. for 3 < c2 < 0 there is an absolute minimum with |z|
near the truncated value and negative vacuum energy. for c2 small and positive
there is a local minimum at |z| near |ztr| and the vacuum energy is positive; as
c2 increases the minimum becomes shallower and moves towards smaller values
of |z|; nally the minimum merges with a point of inection and the condensate
value goes discontinuously to zero, as in a rst-order phase transition4.
the stationary point condition for the potential (9) is a transcendental equa-
tion in z, so we use a series expansion for z near the truncated value and also
search for stationary points numerically. we rewrite the potential as

series expansion, respectively.

for larger |ztr|, the transition occurs at slightly smaller values of x, indicating a
dependence on higher-order terms in |ztr|: for example, at ztr = 0.2 the transition
occurs for 1.872 < x < 1.876. figure 2 shows the value of |z|/|ztr| at the minimum
for the full potential and for the series expansion (14), as a function of x. we
take |ztr| = 103; however, the results are very similar for all values of |ztr| below
about 0.3. both curves dier signicantly from 1, and the series expansion is a
good approximation to the true minimum for x < 0.7. while the series expansion
gives a qualitative picture of the behaviour of |z| near the phase transition, the
value of x where the transition occurs is about twice that predicted by (16). this
is to be expected, since z is large here and the series expansion is less accurate.
figure 3 shows the value of the potential at its minimum and at the truncated
value of z, and the minimum value of the series expansion, as a function of x.
again, there is a signicant deviation from the truncated result for x  few0.1.

4 discussion

in what physical situations are the corrections to the truncated approximation
signicant? in order to generate phenomenologially reasonable supersymmetry
breaking in the visible sector, we require the gravitino mass m3/2 to be of the order
of a tev (see for example [3]); for a single condensate it is given by m3/2  b
6|z|3,
which implies a vev of |z|0 = few  105 for the physical values taken by the
dilaton and moduli today. the parameter x = c2|ztr|2 should be at least o(0.1)
for corrections to the truncated approximation to be appreciable, so unless one
of the terms in c2 is of order 109 or larger the truncated approximation is not in

any danger today.

the rst term in (10) can become large only if the ratio p (y)2/p (y) does
(note that  / is a constant of order 10). it is unlikely that the function p (y),
which describes stringy non-perturbative eects on the dilaton, will give rise to
singularities or very large numbers; in addition, since p (y) cannot change sign,
it cannot be very small without ne-tuning. the only limit in which the dilaton-
dependence causes the truncated approximation to break down is at strong string
coupling (s  0), where the eective action is anyway not valid.
the second term involving h(t )/h(t ), where h(t ) is given by (8), may be-
come large if h(t ) has zeros or singularities in the fundamental domain; in ad-
dition, the eta function decays exponentially with t at re(t )  , which leads
to a divergence at large re(t )5. nothing can be said within the eective theory
about the limit of large re(t ) or the singularities of h(t ), since the condensation
scale c diverges at these points. however, at zeros of h(t ), fgk becomes large
and positive and the condensation scale goes to zero, so the eective action can
be used to describe the condensate at these points.

consider the ansatz for the t -dependence of the superpotential (2,8) involving

the absolute modular invariant j(t ) [10], where h(t ) takes the form

h(t ) = (j  1)m/2j n/3p(j)

(18)

5this behaviour may be understood in terms of string states charged under the gauge group
which become light (mass  mp ) at certain values of t [10]. at large re(t ) the extra
dimensions decompactify and an innite number of kaluza-klein states become light, producing
a linear divergence in the gauge kinetic function. at poles or zeros of h a nite number of
states become light, leading to a logarithmic divergence in fgk.

8

where m, n are positive integers or zero and p(j) is a polynomial in j. this form
for h has no singularity in the fundamental domain, but may have zeros at the
xed point values t =   ei/6 and t = 1, since j  (t  )3 near t =  and
j  (t  1)2 near t = 1.
as t approaches a zero of h(t ) (we consider t =  for deniteness), |ztr|
vanishes with |t  |n/3 and c2 diverges with |t  |2. the potential in the
truncated approximation vtr = (b/6)2|ztr|6c2 varies smoothly as t  ; in the
case n = 1, the potential tends to a non-zero value, even though the condensate
vanishes at t =  and supersymmetry is unbroken. this puzzle is resolved by
looking at the stabilization of the condensate explicitly: as t  , the parameter
x diverges as x  |t  |2n/32, so for 1  n < 3 the truncated approximation
breaks down and |z|min goes to zero abruptly at some nite, small value of |t |.
the scalar potential as a function of t develops a hole around t = , inside
which the condensate and scalar potential vanish and supersymmetry is restored.
if t were to fall into such a region, since z = 0 is always a stationary point of the
eective action, a non-zero condensate would not immediately be restored if t
then rolled out to a value where (16) held: the universe would have to tunnel
back to a supersymmetry-breaking vacuum.

we also consider varying t away from its present-day value in a perturbative
heterotic string vacuum with s  2 and t0 = o(1), to nd the eect of our treat-
ment of the condensate on the (cosmological) evolution of the moduli if re(t )
becomes large. as was argued above, the present-day value of the condensate
should be |z|0  2  105 in planck units. in the case where h(t ) = 6(t ), ztr
varies as 2(t ): for re(t ) > 3 this is well approximated by 2(t ) = et /6,
while the relevant part of c2 is given by c2  2(t + t )/12  1.64 re(t ). the
eective theory breaks down when |ztr| approaches 1, which occurs when t  21;
however, a non-zero condensate is only stable for 1.64 t et /3(2  105)2 < 1 (see
eqn. 16), which implies that t < 1719 (depending on the exact values of |ztr|0
and (t0)). at the phase transition where the condensate collapses, c2  30 so
|ztr|  0.18, which is consistent with using the eective action.
this analysis can also be applied to models of cosmological ination which use
the t modulus to provide a positive vacuum energy [11, 12]. in the region of the
complex t plane where ination occurs, v  |ztr|6c2 should be of order 10104
to produce the correct amplitude of cmb uctuations at large angular scales [12].
typically, this can be achieved for t = o(1) and c2 = o(10), implying that |ztr|
is of order 102 and x  103: the condensate scale here is much larger than
that required to give realistic susy-breaking. repeating the previous analysis,
we nd that the eective theory becomes invalid at re(t )  9 and a non-zero
condensate ceases to be stable for re(t ) between 6.5 and 7.
one might hope to nd a form of t -dependent superpotential (8) involving
j(t ) (18) which allows t to take large values while keeping modular invariance
of the eective action, since it has been suggested that a realistic vacuum of the
strongly-coupled heterotic string [26] may have re(t ) of order 25 [27]. unfortu-
nately the rst term in the large t expansion of j(t ) increases as e2t , so the
exponential growth of ztr  h 1/32 at large re(t ) is likely to be faster than for
constant h, and there is little prospect of stabilizing either the condensate or t
with this ansatz.

5 conclusions

we have studied the stability of a non-zero gaugino condensate in an eective
supergravity model motivated from compactications of heterotic string theory
with duality group sl(2,z). we dened a parameter x which determines the de-
viation of the value of the condensate from its value in global supersymmetry.
using a series expansion for the eective potential, the corrections to the trun-
cated approximation at small x were obtained to second order in (c/mp )2 for
the value of the condensate, and to rst order in (c/mp )2 for the vacuum energy
as a function of the dilaton and t modulus. numerical minimisation of the eec-
tive potential conrms the series expansion results at small x, and reveals a phase
transition at large x where the condensate vanishes discontinuously. this appears
to be caused by the backreaction of the dilaton and t modulus on the hidden
sector gauge dynamics. there are implications for the t -dependence of hidden
sector supersymmetry-breaking : the auxiliary eld f t and the scalar potential
receive large corrections or go to zero abruptly near special points in moduli
space and at large re(t ). in particular, t is not stabilized against arbitrarily
large uctuations.

it would be interesting to nd the eect of non-zero green-schwarz anomaly
cancellation coecients on the s- and t - dependence of the scalar potential,
and also to analyse the stability of the condensate in the linear supermultiplet
formalism [28]. if the potential for t is very at near the minimum, it may be
worth investigating the eect of including planck-suppressed corrections on the
t -dependent yukawa couplings and soft supersymmetry-breaking terms, partic-
ularly if cp-violating phases depend strongly on the vev of t [29].
