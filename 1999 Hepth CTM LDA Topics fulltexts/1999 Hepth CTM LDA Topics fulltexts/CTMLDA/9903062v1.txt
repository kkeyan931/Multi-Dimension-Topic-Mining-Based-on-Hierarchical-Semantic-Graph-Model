abstract

we present a simple and systematic method to calculate the
rindler noise, which is relevant to the analysis of the unruh eect,
by using the uctuation-dissipative theorem. to do this, we calculate
the dissipative coecient explicitly from the equations of motion of
the detector and the eld. this method gives not only the correct
answer but also a hint as to the origin of the apparent statistics in-
version eect. moreover, this method is generalized to the dirac eld,
by using the fermionic uctuation-dissipation theorem. we can thus
conrm that the fermionic uctuation-dissipation theorem is working
properly.

1 introduction

for a uniformly accelerated observer in the at spacetime, the ordinary
minkowski vacuum, which is dened by using the frequency with respect
to the minkowski time, can be seen as a thermal bath of particles [1]. (the
temperature of the thermal bath is ha/2 where a is the acceleration of the
observer.) these particles are considered as the rindler particles which are
dened by using the frequency with respect to the rindler time [2, 3, 4].
this eect is called the unruh eect.

in order to see this eect, it is convenient to introduce a model of a
particle detector called the dewitt detector [5]. the dewitt detector is a

1

point-like object with internal energy levels and moves along the world line
x( ) where  is the proper time of the detector. the internal energy levels
of the detector are {ei} and corresponding eigenstates are {|eii}. that is,
(1.1)

hd|eii = ei|eii,

where hd is the hamiltonian of the internal structure of the detector. also,
the detector has an internal degree of freedom (monopole moment) q( ).
the time evolution of q( ) in the heisenberg picture is

q( ) = eihd /hq(0) eihd /h.

(1.2)

and then, the detector is linearly coupled to a eld (x) via this monopole.
the interaction is described by the interaction lagrangian

lint = q( )( ),

(1.3)

where ( )  (x( )) is the value of the eld along the world line of the
detector. (to be precise, we need the adiabatic switching.)
the measurement process by this detector is as follows. suppose that,
at  = , the detector is in the ground state |e0i and the eld is in the
minkowski vacuum |0mi. after the detector-eld interaction is switched on,
the detector would not remain in |e0i, but would make a transition to an
excited state. it means that the detector detects some particles.
the transition amplitude for the detector-eld system to be found in

|e1, i at  =  is given by rst order perturbation theory as

ihe1, |z 



d q( )( )|e0, 0mi.

(1.4)

(here, it has been assumed that the matrix element of q is suciently small
enough for the perturbation theory to be appropriate.) by eq.(1.2), this can
be written as

ihe1|q(0)|e0iz 



d ei(e1e0) /hh|( )|0mi.

(1.5)

therefore, after summation over all the nal states of the eld |i, the tran-
sition rate (the transition probability per unit proper time) from e0 to e1
is

(1.6)

|he1|q(0)|e0i|2 f(cid:18)e1  e0

h

(cid:19) ,

2

where

and

f () =z 



d(   ) ei(  )g(   )

g(   ) = h0m|( )( )|0mi.

(1.7)

(1.8)

thus, the transition rate of the dewitt detector is proportional to the
response function f () which depends only on the eld and the world
line of the detector but not on the internal structure of the detector. note
that we may regard g(   ) as a kind of noise, the quantum noise in the
minkowski vacuum along the world line x( ) and the response function as
the power spectrum of this noise.

for the unruh eect, the relevant noise is the rindler noise, where x( ) is
a uniformly accelerated world line. in two dimensions, the power spectrum of
the rindler noise (the response of the detector) is exactly those of the thermal
noise in the thermal bath. however, in other dimensions, it was shown by
takagi [6] that there are some dierences between the rindler noise and the
thermal noise. specially, the rindler noise exhibits the phenomenon of the
apparent inversion of statistics in odd dimensions.

in this paper, we present a simple and systematic method to reproduce
these results by using the uctuation-dissipation theorem [7, 8, 9] which is
a basis of statistical mechanics for irreversible processes when the systems
are slightly away from thermal equilibrium. this theorem states the relation
between the spontaneous uctuation of elds in thermal equilibrium and the
irreversible dissipation. although the uctuation-dissipation theorem has
been formulated by various authors, we adopt the formulation by callen and
welton [7], because their formulation is intuitively understandable and ap-
pealing. they showed that a general form of uctuation-dissipation theorem
covers a wide range of phenomena such as the einstein relation for brownian
motion, the nyquist formula for voltage uctuation in conductors, and the
planck distribution for photons.

of course, the uctuation-dissipation point of view was already pointed
out [10, 6]. however, the previous discussions concentrated on the vacuum
expectation value of the commutator and anticommutator of the elds in
connection with the huygens principle. although these commutators are
related to the dissipation, the notion of dissipation is not quite clear. in
addition, the calculations involved in obtaining these commutators are quan-
tum and essentially the same as those to obtain the uctuation directly.

3

in contrast, in our application of the uctuation-dissipation theorem to
the unruh eect, we calculate the dissipative coecient explicitly from the
equations of motion of the detector and the eld. then, by virtue of the
theorem, we can immediately obtain the rindler noise. all the calculation
we need is classical and thus our calculation is completely dierent from the
previous ones. by this calculation, we can get not only the correct answer
but also a hint as to the origin of the apparent statistics inversion eect.

moreover, our method is generalized to a dirac eld, by using the
uctuation-dissipation theorem of a fermionic operator [11]. in the context
of condensed matter physics, the fermionic uctuation-dissipation theorem
may not be directly applicable, because we usually measure bosonic quan-
tities such as voltage or electric current.
in this paper, we show that the
fermionic uctuation-dissipation theorem is indeed applicable to the unruh
eect and works properly.

to our knowledge, the present approach to the unruh eect by using the
bosonic and fermionic uctuation-dissipation theorem as a corner stone has
not been discussed before.

2 rindler noise of real scalar field

2.1 thermal noise

in order to see how the uctuation-dissipation theorem works not only for
the thermal noise but also for the rindler noise to be discussed later, we rst
consider the thermal noise. the system consists of a real scalar eld and a
detector in n dimensional at spacetime. the detector is at rest and linearly
coupled with the scalar eld through an internal degree of freedom q(t),
there. the scalar eld is initially in thermal equilibrium at temperature t .
thus, the action of the total system is

where

s = s0(q) + sint(q, ) + s0(),

s0(q) = z dt l(q, q),

sint(q, ) = z dtd~x q(t) (~x, t) (~x  ~x0)

s0() = z dtd~x

and ~x0 is the position of the detector. (~x stands for an (n  1)-dimensional
vector.) here, we do not need an explicit form of l(q, q) which is the
lagrangian for the (unperturbed) detector.

from this action, we can derive the equations of motion

note that we have added the i terms to the denominator of the integrand
to avoid the singularity. the sign is + for  > 0 and  for  < 0 due to
causality. (the integrand, as a function of , must be analytic in the lower-
half plane of the complex  plane.) thus, kn() has the imaginary part.
this gives the friction term. we note that the conventional denition of the
friction term contains the time derivative of q(t), which is converted to i
by fourier transformation. so, the conventional denition of the dissipative
coecient rn() is given by

imkn() = rn().

(2.14)

the real part of kn() would diverge for higher n. but, fortunately, for our
application of the uctuation-dissipation theorem, we only need the imag-
inary part. (the divergence of the real part of kn() would generally be
renormalized by the potential of the detector.)

(for m = 0).

(2.19)

by the uctuation-dissipation theorem [7], this dissipation suggests the
uctuation of the scalar eld if in thermal equilibrium. the uctuation of

6

the scalar eld is dened by

h(~x0, t)(~x0, t)i  trheh (~x0, t)(~x0, t)i /trhehi

=

where

fn() =z dt ei(tt)h(~x0, t)(~x0, t)i

2.2 rindler noise

next, we consider the rindler noise. the system again consists of a real
scalar eld and a detector in n dimensional at spacetime. however, the
detector is now uniformly accelerated, i.e., the world line of the detector is

x0( ) = a1 sinh a,
x1( ) = a1 cosh a,
xi( ) = const.,

(i = 2,   , n  1)

(2.24)
(2.25)
(2.26)

where  is the proper time of the detector and a is the acceleration. therefore,
it is convenient to take the rindler coordinates [12]

x0 =  sinh ,
x1 =  cosh ,
xi = xi.

(i = 2,   , n  1)

(2.27)
(2.28)
(2.29)

in these coordinates, the world line of the detector is

( ) = a,
( ) = a1,
xi( ) = const.

(i = 2,   , n  1)

(2.30)
(2.31)
(2.32)

the detector is again linearly coupled with the scalar eld through an internal
degree of freedom q( ), there. however, the scalar eld is initially in the
ground state in this case. the action of the total system is

s = s0(q) + sint(q, ) + s0(),

(2.33)

where

s0(q) = z d l(q, q),

(2.34)

= z d q( ) (a1, x0, a ),

sint(q, ) = z d dddx q( ) (, x, ) (  a1) (  a ) (x  x0)
(i)2  m22# ,(2.36)
n1xi=2
and x0 is the position of the detector. (x stands for an (n  2)-dimensional
vector.) s0() is the same as eq.(2.4) but written in the rindler coordinates.
again, we do not need an explicit form of l(q, q) which is the lagrangian
for the (unperturbed) detector.

(2.63)

by the uctuation-dissipation theorem, this dissipation means the uc-
tuation of the scalar eld if in thermal equilibrium. although the scalar
eld is in the vacuum state in this case, we can view it as in thermal equi-
librium at temperature t = ha/2 by the thermalization theorem. there
are various versions of the theorem. (for a review, see ref.[6].)

for example, since the positive rindler wedge r+ (a quarter of the
minkowski spacetime, x1 > |x0|) is causally disconnected from the negative
rindler wedge r (another quarter of the minkowski spacetime, x1 < |x0|),
a uniformly accelerated observer who will be permanently conned within r+
does not concern with the degrees of the freedom associated with r. then,
by tracing out over these degrees from the minkowski vacuum, the observer
gets the thermal density matrix at temperature t = ha/2 [4]. more specif-
ically [14, 15, 6],

h0m|o(+)|0mi = tr(cid:20)e 2

a ah (+)

r o(+)(cid:21) /tr(cid:20)e 2

a ah (+)

r (cid:21) ,

(2.64)

where o(+) is an operator only for r+ and h (+)
r is the rindler hamiltonian
(the generator of  translation, i.e., the boost) restricted to there. note
that, for the uniformly accelerated observer, the generator of  translation is
ah (+)
r . that is, as far as the uniformly accelerated observer is concerned, the
expectation value in the minkowski vacuum of the operator can be seen as an
ensemble average over the density matrix which is the same form as canonical
ensemble at temperature t = ha/2. this eective canonical ensemble is
true even for interacting elds [16, 17].

equivalently, one can see the thermal character from the periodicity of
the propagator in the imaginary time [18, 15]. moreover, it was shown by
sewell [19] in the context of the axiomatic quantum eld theory that the

12

rindler noise satises the kms condition [8, 20] (which is the denition of
the thermal equilibrium with the systems with innite numbers of degrees of
freedom) at temperature t = ha/2 for general interacting eld of any spin
in any dimension. the intuitive explanation of sewells theorem is found in
ref.[10].

from these various versions of the thermalization theorem, one might
conclude without calculations that the rindler noise is the same as the ther-
mal noise at temperature t = ha/2. however, these results only mean that
the uniformly accelerated observer would see the minkowski vacuum as the
thermal equilibrium state but do not mean that the uniformly accelerated
detector would respond in the same way as it would do at rest in the thermal
bath, as was emphasized by unruh-wald [4] and takagi [6]. the thermaliza-
tion theorem, itself, says nothing about the noise. in fact, the rindler noise
is dierent from the thermal noise in several points.

now, we shall calculate the rindler noise. by using eq.(2.54), the ther-
malization theorem and the uctuation-dissipation theorem, we can take a
shortcut to calculate it. the uctuation of the scalar eld is dened by

h0m|( )( )|0mi =

1

2z 



d fn(),

(2.65)

where ( ) = (( ), x( ), ( )) is the value of the eld along the world line
of the detector and

fn() =z d  ei(  )h0m|( )( )|0mi

(2.66)

is the power spectrum of the rindler noise. then, by using eq.(2.64), the
uctuation-dissipation theorem says that, for the massless case,

for odd n. (we believe that our result is a correct one.) note that, in ref.[6],
the case of the complex scalar eld was calculated, but the result is the same
for the real scalar eld as will be explained in the next section.

we have derived eq.(2.67) on the basis of eq.(2.64) and the uctuation-
dissipation theorem of a bosonic operator. this clearly shows that the statis-
tics inversion is an apparent one not based on the basic principle of statisti-
cal mechanics but based on the temperature dependence of the dissipative
coecient.

3 generalization to complex scalar field

now, we generalize the analysis to that of a complex scalar eld. the sit-
uation is the same as the real scalar case, except that q and  become
non-hermitian.

3.1 thermal noise

for the thermal noise, eqs.(2.3) and (2.4) are replaced by

sint(q, ) = z dtd~x hq(t) (~x, t) + q(t) (~x, t)i (~x  ~x0)

= z dt hq(t) (~x0, t) + q(t) (~x0, t)i ,
n1xi=1 |i|2  m2||2# .

s0() = z dtd~x "|t|2 

(3.1)

(3.2)

14

thus, the eective equation of motion for the detector is

q! + kn() q() = 0,
 gs0

(3.3)

where kn() is the same function as the real scalar case eq.(2.13). therefore,
the dissipative coecient is the same as the real scalar case eq.(2.19).

then, we can use the uctuation-dissipation theorem of a non-hermitian

operator [11]. the uctuation of the eld is now dened by

where

and the theorem says that

(for m = 0) (3.7)

similarly, for the rindler noise, eqs.(2.35) and (2.36) are replaced by

sint(q, ) = z d dddx hq( ) (, x, ) + q( ) (, x, )i
 (  a1) (  a ) (x  x0)

= z d hq( ) (a1, x0, a ) + q( ) (a1, x0, a )i , (3.8)
n1xi=2 |i|2  m2||2# ,(3.9)

s0() = z dddx " 1

15

and the eective equation of motion becomes

q! + kn() q() = 0,
 gs0

(3.10)

where kn() is the same function as the real scalar case eq.(2.49). so, the
dissipative coecient is the same as the real scalar case eq.(2.54), again.

the uctuation of the eld is now dened by

fn() =z d  ei(  )h0m|( )( )|0mi,

and, by using the uctuation-dissipation theorem of a non-hermitian opera-
tor [11] and eq.(2.64), one nds that

4 generalization to dirac field

next, we generalize to a dirac eld, using the uctuation-dissipation theorem
of a fermionic operator [11]. the situation is the same as the scalar case.
however, the internal degree of freedom of the detector is now a spinor 
and the eld is a dirac eld .

16

4.1 thermal noise

for the thermal noise, the action of the total system is

s = s0() + sint(, ) + s0(),

where

and

s0() = z dt l(, ),

sint(, ) = z dtd~x h (t) (~x, t) + (~x, t) (t)i (~x  ~x0)

= z dt h (t) (~x0, t) + (~x0, t) (t)i ,

s0() = z dtd~x  [i  m] ,
  0.

  0,

here,  are the  matrices which satisfy

{, } = 2.

the equations of motion become

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

where l denotes the left-derivative. after fourier transformation and elim-
ination of the eld, one nds that the eective equation of motion for the
detector is

  ! + k1/2,n() () = 0,
  gls0
k1/2,n() =z

(2)n1 0 + ~k  ~ + m
2 + |~k|2 + m2  i

d~k

(4.9)

.

(4.10)

where

17

(the subscript 1/2 denotes the spin of eld.) since the ~k  ~ term is odd
in ~k, we can relate k1/2,n() to that of the scalar case eq.(2.13),

k1/2,n() =h0 + mi kn().

therefore, we dene the dissipative coecient as

r1/2,n()  

imk1/2,n()



= h0 + mi rn(),

(4.11)

(4.12)

where rn() is that of the scalar case eq.(2.18). this extra  sign is a
convention; it was chosen so that the dissipative coecient is positive in
the sense that

for   0,
and this convention is the same as in ref.[11]. we also dene

tr 0r1/2,n()  rn()  0

and

r1/2,n()  r1/2,n() =h0 + mi rn()
tr 0 r1/2,n()  rn()  0
for   0.

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

then, we can use the uctuation-dissipation theorem of a fermionic op-

erator [11]. the thermal uctuation of the dirac eld is dened by

h(~x0, t) (~x0, t)i  trheh (~x0, t) (~x0, t)i /trhehi

= z dth(~x0, t) (~x0, t)i(t  t)

=

2z dtd ei(tt)

 h(~x0, t) (~x0, t)i.

the power spectrum of the dirac eld is dened by

f1/2,n()  1

n tr(cid:20)0z dt ei(tt)h(~x0, t) (~x0, t)i(cid:21) ,

18

(4.16)

(4.17)

where n is the dimension of the  matrices. therefore,

n

2 z 



d f1/2,n().

(4.18)

then, the theorem [11] says that

this result is consistent with the previous result. (see, for example, ref.[6].)
the dierences between this case and the scalar case are the power of 
in the numerator, which comes from the fact that the dirac equation is
the rst order with respect to the time derivative, and the fermi distribution
factor, which is provided by the uctuation-dissipation theorem of a fermionic
operator.

4.2 rindler noise

for the rindler noise, one might dene the rindler noise of dirac eld as

(4.20)
however, this noise is not stationary, i.e., is not a function of    . instead,
we dene the rindler noise of dirac eld as [6, 15]

h0m|( ) ( )|0mi.

where

h0m| ( )

( )|0mi,
a 01(cid:21) ( )

= hcosh(a /2)  01 sinh(a /2)i ( )

(4.22)

this transformation is the lorentz transformation, the boost, from the lab-
oratory frame to the instantaneously comoving frame of the uniformly accel-
erated observer at  .

thus, we write the action in terms of
(, x, )  s 

a

(, x, ),

( )  s ( ).

then, the action of the total system is

s = s0( ) + sint( , ) + s0( ),

where

s0( ) = z d l( ,

this s0( ) is the same as eq.(4.4) but written in the rindler coordinates and

space and dene the spinor with respect to the local lorentz, we would get
this action.)

in order to deal with the 01 term of the second equation, we dene the

by using these projection operators, we can divide  into two parts

here, we have again included the extra  sign as a convention in the denition

then, we can use the uctuation-dissipation theorem of a fermionic op-

that is, the power spectrum of the rindler noise of massless dirac eld in n
dimensions is proportional to that of massless scalar eld eq.(2.67) in n + 1
dimensions. from the analysis of the scalar case, we can thus show the
statistical inversion. this result nicely agrees with that of takagi [6].

5 conclusion

we have presented a simple and systematic method to evaluate the rindler
noise. we have rst calculated the dissipative coecient explicitly from
the equations of motion of the detector and the eld. then, by using the
uctuation-dissipative theorem, we have obtained the rindler noise which is
relevant to the analysis of the unruh eect. this method is generalized to
the dirac eld, by using the fermionic uctuation-dissipation theorem [11].
these results are perfectly consistent with previously known results including
apparent statistical inversion in odd dimensions.

although the rindler noise can be calculated directly from the action of
the eld as takagi [6] did, we emphasize that there are several advantages in
calculating the noise indirectly. that is, to introduce the detector, calculate
the dissipative coecient and then use the uctuation-dissipation theorem,
as we have done in this paper.

first of all,

it contains only the classical calculations expect for the
uctuation-dissipation theorem. to calculate the dissipative coecient, we
only have to eliminate the degree of freedom of the eld from classical equa-
tions of motion of the detector and eld. thus, the calculations become much
simpler.

next, this method gives a hint as to the origin of the apparent statistics in-
version eect. while the dissipative coecient for the thermal noise does not
depend on the temperature in an ideal setting, those for the rindler noise in-
evitably depends on the temperature (the acceleration). this temperature-
dependence of the dissipative coecient destroys the simple bose (or fermi)
distribution provided by the uctuation-dissipation theorem and causes the
phenomenon of the apparent inversion of statistics in odd dimensions [6].
why does this dierence happen? from our calculation, the answer is ob-
vious. note that all the eect of the eld on the detector is represented by
the inuence functional [9] which is constructed from the action of the eld,
the detector-eld interaction and the initial condition of the eld. (the in-
uence functional for a scalar eld in the minkowski vacuum, coupled to a
uniformly accelerating dewitt detector was derived by anglin [22].) in the
thermal case, the temperature is the initial condition. on the other hand,
in the rindler case, the temperature is in the detector-eld interaction as
the acceleration. because it is only the action of the eld and the detector-
eld interaction that are needed to obtain the eective equation of motion

24

and thus the dissipative coecient, the dissipative coecient for the ther-
mal noise does not depend on the temperature in our idealized treatment
but those for the rindler noise inevitably depends on the temperature. (of
course, this point of view would not explain everything about the apparent
statistics inversion eect.)

finally, we can see that the fermionic uctuation-dissipation theorem [11]
works properly. in the context of condensed matter physics, it is generally
dicult to use the fermionic uctuation-dissipation theorem because we usu-
ally measure bosonic quantities such as voltage or electric current. however,
we have applied this fermionic version of the theorem to the unruh eect
and have obtained the right result including apparent statistical inversion
in odd dimensions. thus, we have conrmed that the fermionic uctuation-
dissipation theorem is indeed working properly.

since the relation between rindler and minkowski coordinates is very
similar to the relation between schwarzschild and kruskal coordinates, there
is a hope that the above method could be applicable to the hawking radia-
tion [23, 24] also. this would be a future work.
