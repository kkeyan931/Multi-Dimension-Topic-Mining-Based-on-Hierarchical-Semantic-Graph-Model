abstract

by adding gauge elds to the d-string classical solution which have non-zero
contribution to commutators in continuum limit (extreme large n ), we introduced
(m, n)-strings in iib matrix model. it is found that the size of matrices depends on
the value of the electric eld. the tension of these strings appear in sl(2, z) in-
variant form. the interaction for parallel and angled strings are found in agreement
with string theory.

matrix models have been conjectured to be the non-perturbative formulations of string
theories [1, 2, 3]. among the years these models have shown their abilities in covering
many aspects of string theory [4, 5], including representation of various bps congura-
tions, d-brane interactions and dynamics, compactication subjects and string dualities.
however there are some issues which have lacked the complete correspondence between
string theory and matrix models. one may recall some of these issues as absence of
transverse ns5-branes in m(atrix) model and the important one, formulation of matrix
models in general backgrounds. in an interesting paper [6] for compactication of matrix
models, a non-commutative structure was resolved to push formulation of matrix models
in non-zero form eld backgrounds. more specically, it was shown that the amount of
the non-commutativity in gauge theory of d-branes is measured by the form eld ux.

in string theory side this issue was approached in the context of bound-states of fun-
damental strings (f-strings) with d-branes and also d-branes with each other.
in a
series of works [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] it was understood that this new structure can be derived

by string theoretic description of d-branes [12]; considering non-trivial form eld back-
ground on the world-volume of d-branes in extracting the boundary conditions of open
strings ended on d-branes. it is observed that the non-zero background causes mixing the
dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions at the ends of strings and it is the reason for
non-commutative coordinates on the d-brane world-volume. as is known in the d-brane
action, called dbi action, the combination f = b  [a] appears, with b as the
ns b-eld and a as the gauge eld living on the d-brane.
in this picture, non-zero
background have the interpretation as the bound-states of f-strings with d-branes (in
6= 0) or d-branes with each other (fij 6= 0) [13, 14]. so one may inter-
the case f0i
pret the f-string bound-states as turned on electric eld, and d-brane bound-states as
turned on magnetic ones in the gauge theory of d-branes. in [9] the spectrums of these
bound-states have been studied to compare with duality predictions. in the most famous
case fd-string bound-states, so-called (m, n)-strings [15, 16], the tension appeared in the
sl(2, z) invariant form

t(m,n) =

in [17, 18] this issue was considered in the context of iib matrix model [2]. the crucial
observation was about those sectors of commutation relations between the position ma-
trices of d-branes which remain non-zero in the continuum limit (extreme large-n limit).
it was shown that the non-zero commutation relations between the position matrices are
responsible for the non-commutativity in the world-volume and gauge theory of d-branes.
it is the purpose of this work to consider the (m, n)-strings in the context of iib
matrix model, as they are expected from the sl(2, z) symmetry of iib string theory .
based on the background mentioned above, we introduce (m, n)-string by adding gauge
elds to d-string classical solution, which have non-zero contribution to commutators in
continuum limit (extreme large n). it is found that the size of matrices depends on the
value of the electric eld. the tension of these strings appear in sl(2, z) invariant form.
the interaction for parallel and angled strings are found in agreement with string theory

the iib matrix model action is

where x and  are hermitian n  n matrices so(10) bosons and fermions, respectively.
this subject has been addressed in [19]. also the interaction between a f-string and d-string is

calculated in [20] in compact space.

here we are dierent with original action by an overall numerical factor, to set the tension of a

d-string

the classical equations of motion are read as

[x, [x, x]] = 0.

solutions with [x, x]  1 and with the other xs vanishing are in special interest to
represent dp-branes of string theory. for d-string we have

x0 =

(4)

where q and p are matrices with size n to be large, with the commutation relation and
uniformly eigenvalue distributions as:

[q, p] = i,

0  q, p 

2n .

(5)

the one-loop eective action w is calculated in [2] with the bosonic, fermionic and

ghost contributions:

w =  ln(cid:18)det 1

(6)

with p = [x,], f = [f ,], and f = i[x, x]. in the cases of our interest we
have [x, f] = c  number, and so p 2
 and f are simultaneously diagonalizable. by
writing f in the jordan form introduced in [2] with a1, ..., a5 as the o-diagonal entries
one nds for the one-loop eective action (6) the form

w =

it is worth mentioning that the congurations with f  0 for all , , like the same as
d-string (4), have vanishing quantum corrections due to the algebra

w  tr log(p 2

 ) (

(8)

this is an evidence for the stability of the solution under quantum uctuations, as one
expects for a bps state.

also, let us calculate the tension of our d-string solution. by inserting the solution

(4) in the action one nds:

s =

the equation of motion for the size of matrices, n, gives [2]

s

= 0  n =

t l
2

,

which by re-inserting it in the on-shell action (9) one has

s =

1

2gs  t l,

(10)

(11)

to read the tension of d-string
number of d-strings simply one can multiply the coordinates by 1n as

. for the solutions with the interpretation of n

1

2gs

so one nds the on-shell action

x  x  1n.

s =

n

2gs  t l,

(12)

(13)

with the clear interpretation for the tension of the bound-state of n d-strings.

it is known that the bound-state of d-strings and f-strings, called (m, n)-strings, are
described by turned on electric eld in the d-string gauge theory world-volume [13, 14].
so one should add non-trivial bundles to the solutions [21]:

x0 =

qt
2n

+ d0, x1 =

pl
2n

+ d1, xi2 = 0,

setting the commutation relation to be

f01 = i[x0, x1] = 

t l
2n  c,

with c independent of n. by inserting this solution in the action one nds:

s =

1

262gs

t 2l2
42

1
n

+ c2n +

t l


c +

3
2gs

n.

(14)

(15)

(16)

notice that there is a term independent of n; it is the same topological term known to
be added to the dbi action for d-branes. the equation of motion for the size of matrices
gives

n =

1

622 + c2

t l
2

,

which by re-inserting it in the on-shell action (16) one has

s =

1

2gs

622 + c2

6

 t l +

c

2622gs  t l.

(17)

(18)

to set the tension of this object as the same of (m, 1)-string of formula (1) one adjusts

c = 6  f ,

f  mgs,

and nds the on-shell action

s =

t l

2s 1

s

+ m2 +

t l

(19)

(20)

the tension appeared in the rst term is the same as (m, 1)-string by the relation (1).
the gs independent term is here sitting as the n independent term. this term is known
as one which is responsible for the coupling of rr eld to d-brane ([13], p33-35). finally
one should specify the bundles d. in a specic gauge one chooses [21]

d0  0, d1 

p2n

t

 c, di2  0.

(21)

construction of (m, n)-strings can be obtained as the same as transformation (12), to nd
the tension (1).

in the case of pure d-strings (m = 0) it is known how to introduce two or more
separated of them [2], but it is some more obstacle in the case of (m, n)-strings. as we
see from (17) the number of f-strings, m, enters in the size of matrices. so one should
choose the sizes of matrices dierent. two separated (m1, 1)- and (m2, 2)-strings may be
presented by

and 3 as the 3rd pauli matrix. again by inserting the solution in the action and solving
the equation of motion for n1,2 one nds

as is seen from (24) the sizes of matrices are corrected in the small f limit by  o(f 2).
the non-trivial check for the above picture of (m, n)-strings is interaction considera-

tions.

interaction of two parallel (m1, 1)- and (m2, 1)-strings
since in the parallel case only the dierence of m1 and m2 enters in the force, for

simplicity we put m = m1 = m2. we get the solution as

for two strings in distance r in 2nd direction. here c = 6  f . so one nds

 as 2(2c)(k + 1

where 3 = [1  3,]. 3 has 2, -2, 0 and 0 as eigenvalues. so one nds the eigenvalues

this result coincides with the string theory result ([10] eq. 17) for small f .

interaction of two angled (m1, 1)- and (m2, 1)-strings
here as the parallel case we set m = m1 = m2 k. the conguration with two angled

the small f expansion is expected by recalling the intrinsic denition of matrix model in gs  0

appears in the interaction.
