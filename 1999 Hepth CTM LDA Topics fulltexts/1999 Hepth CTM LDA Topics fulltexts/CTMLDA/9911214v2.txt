introduction

the causal approach to renormalization theory pioneered by epstein and glaser [21], [22] provides
essential simplication at the fundamental level as well as at to the computational aspects. this is
best illustrated in [38] where quantum electrodynamics is constructed entirely in the framework of
the causal approach. moreover, one can use the same ideas to analyse other theories as for instance,
yang-mills theories [9] [10] [12] [13] [1] [2] [4]-[6], [29]-[32], [35] [37] [20], gravitation [23], [24], [42], etc.
let us remind briey the main ideas of epstein-glaser-scharf approach. according to bogoliubov
and shirkov, the s-matrix is constructed inductively order by order as a formal series of operator
valued distributions:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

in

n! zr4n

dx1    dxn tn(x1,    , xn)g(x1)    g(xn),

(1.0.1)

where g(x) is a tempered test function in the minkowski space r4 that switches the interaction and
tn are operator-valued distributions acting in the fock space of some collection of free elds. these
operator-valued distributions, which are called chronological products should verify some properties
which can be argued starting from bogoliubov axioms. these axioms will be detailed in the next
section. the main point is that one can show that, starting from a convenient interaction lagrangian
t1(x) one can construct the whole series tn, n  2. the interaction lagrangian must satisfy some
requirements such like poincare invariance, hermiticity and causality; it is not easy to nd a general
solution of this problem but there are some rather general expressions fullling these demands, namely
the so-called wick polynomials. these are expressions operating in hilbert spaces of a special kind,
namely in fock spaces.. a fock space is a canonical object attached to any single-particle hilbert and
reasonably describes a system of weakly interacting particles.

the physical s-matrix is obtained from s(g) taking the adiabatic limit which is , loosely speaking
the limit g(x)  0. one should also point out that the recursive process of constructing the chrono-
logical produces xes them almost uniquely, more precisely the distribution tn is unique up to a
distribution nn(x1,    , xn) with support in the set

{(x1,    , xn)  (r4)n|x1 =    = xn}.

this type of distribution are also called nite renormalizations.

in the old version of renormalization theory, one starts from the naive expressions of the chrono-
logical product and sees that they are not properly dened, i.e. some innities do appear. the main
obstacle is to amend the naive expression such that well dened expressions are obtained which do also
verify bogoliubov axioms. in epstein-glaser approach, the main problem of the the construction of
the chronological products is done recurringly and it is reduced to the problem of distribution splitting.
it can be proved that this operation has always solutions consistent with bogoliubov axioms.

in the case of a gauge theory there is a supplementary property to be veried. the main obstacle
in constructing the perturbation series for a gauge eld is the fact that, as it happens for the electro-
magnetic eld, one is forced to use non-physical degrees of freedom for the description of the free elds
[45], [41], [34] in a fock space formalism. one must consider an auxiliary fock space hgh including,
beside the various elds, some ctious elds, called ghosts, and construct an supercharge thats it an
operator q verifying q2 = 0 such that the physical hilbert space is hphys  ker (q)/im(q). the
necessity to consider ghost elds comes mainly from the fact that, up to now, there is no other way to
construct an interaction lagrangian. on the other hand, one can construct a convenient interaction

1

lagrangian in the bigger hilbert space hgh and apply the construction of epstein and glaser without
any change. however, in this case one must impose, beside the usual bogoliubov axioms, the sup-
plementary condition that the s matrix factorizes to hphys. this condition proves to be too strong
and one must replace it by a weaker condition of factorization to the physical hilbert space in the
adiabatic limit:

lim0z(r4)n

dx1    dxng(x1)    g(xn)[q, tn(x1, . . . , xn)]ker(q) = 0,

n  1.

(1.0.2)

even this condition seems to be problematic because the adiabatic limit does not exists if zero-
mass particles are present, so one must weaken further this requirement as it is done in [9] where one
requires that:

[q, tn(x1, . . . , xn)] = i

xl=1

n


x
l

t 
n/l(x1, . . . , xn),

n  n

(1.0.3)

l = 1, . . . n. this condition leads to the previous one if one formally
for some wick polynomials tn/l,
takes the adiabatic limit and it is called the gauge invariance of the theory. it is impressive that this
condition for n = 1 and n = 2 xes almost uniquely the possible form of the interaction lagrangian
and leads to the presence of a r-dimensional lie group of symmetries in the case of system composed
of r bosons of spin 1 [1], [25]. this result can be extended to the case of presence of matter elds
[2], [26] paving the way to a rigorous understanding of the standard model of elementary particles. in
[27] the analysis is pushed to order n = 3 and the axial anomaly appears in a natural context, as an
obstruction to the factorization condition (1.0.3) to the physical hilbert space. the gauge invariance
problem is now to prove that the identities (1.0.3) can be fullled for every n  n, more precisely to
show that one can use the freedom left in the chronological products (the nite renormalizations) to
impose gauge invariance in every order of perturbation theory. this problem is addressed in [38] in
the case of quantum electrodynamics and in [10] [12] in the yang-mills case. the idea is to assume
that one has (1.0.3) for p = 1, . . . , n  1 and prove it for p = n. the proof of renormalizability of
quantum electrodynamic from [38] is done without using ghosts elds; this is possible in this case,
but in order to generalize the method to yang-mills theories it is better to understand the proof in
the ghost quantization formalism. also we mention that the proof from [38] relies on some reduction
formul for 1-particle reducible feynman graphs. a rigorous proof of these formulae seems to be
absent.

the main point of this paper is that with a proper formulation of the induction hypothesis one can
simplify considerably the proof such that its mathematical rigor becomes obvious. the idea is that if
one formulates the induction hypothesis in close analogy with the analysis of epstein and glaser then
one can prove that in the order n one has instead of (1.0.3) the relation

[q, tn(x1, . . . , xn)] = i

n

xl=1


x
l

t 
n/l(x1, . . . , xn) + pn(x1, . . . , xn),

n  n

(1.0.4)

where pn is a nite renormalization. this nite renormalization can be so much restricted from the
induction process that it is an elementary matter to show that one can modify appropriately the
expressions tn and tn/l in such a way that one has pn = 0. in this process, the use of some discrete
symmetry like charge conjugation is important.

we will adopt the gauge invariance in the form (1.0.3) so we will not touch the adiabatic limit

problem in our analysis.

2

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section we x the notations and clarify the setting
we use. we will present bogoliubov axioms of the perturbation theory. because the main point of
our paper is to formulate the induction hypothesis in strict analogy to [21] we will summarize the
induction argument used for a theory without gauge invariance. then we present the modication of
the setting one must impose to study quantum electrodynamics. in section 3 we will give the proof
of gauge invariance of quantum electrodynamics. the conclusions are grouped in the last section.

2.1 bogoliubov axioms

we give here the set of axioms imposed on the chronological products tp following the notations of
[21].

 first, it is clear that we can consider them completely symmetrical in all variables without loosing

generality:

tp(x(1),    x(p)) = tp(x1,    xp),

  pp.

(2.1.1)

 next, we must have poincare invariance. because we will consider in an essential way dirac
elds, this amounts to suppose that in the in the fock space we have an unitary representation
(a, a) 7 ua,a of the group insl(2, c) (the universal covering group of the proper orthochronous
poincare group p 

+ - see [43] for notations) such that:

ua,atp(x1,    , xp)u 1

a,a = tp((a)  x1 + a,    , (a)  xp + a),

a  sl(2, c), a  r4 (2.1.2)

where sl(2, c)  a(a)  p 
essential for implementing epstein-glaser scheme of renormalization.

+ is the covering map.

in particular, translation invariance is

sometimes it is possible to supplement this axiom by corresponding invariance properties with
respect to inversions (spatial and temporal) and charge conjugation. for the standard model
only the pct invariance is available.

x0 > 0} and v   {x  r4| x2 > 0,

 the central axiom seems to be the requirement of causality which can be written compactly as
follows. let us rstly introduce some standard notations. denote by v +  {x  r4| x2 >
x0 < 0} the upper (lower) lightcones and by
0,
if x  {x1,    , xm}  r4m and y  {y1,    , yn}  r4m are such that
v  their closures.
xi  yj 6 v ,
j = 1, . . . , n we use the notation x  y. if xi  yj 6 v + 
v ,
j = 1, . . . , n we use the notations: x  y. we use the compact notation
t (x)  tp(x1,    , xp) with the convention

i = 1, . . . , m,

i = 1, . . . , m,

t ()  1

(2.1.3)

and by xy we mean the juxtaposition of the elements of x and y . in particular, the expression
t (x1x2) makes sense because of the symmetry property (2.1.1). then the causality axiom
writes as follows:

t (x1x2) = t (x1)t (x2),

x1  x2.

(2.1.4)

remark 2.1 it is important to note that from (2.1.4) one can derive easily:

[t (x1), t (x2)] = 0,

if x1  x2.

(2.1.5)

 the unitarity of the s-matrix can be most easily expressed (see [21]) if one introduces, the

following formal series:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

(i)n

n! zr4n

dx1    dxn tn(x1,    , xn)g(x1)    g(xn),

(2.1.6)

4

where, by denition:

(1)|x| t (x) 

|x|

xr=1

(1)r xpartitions

t (x1)    t (xr);

(2.1.7)

here x1,    , xr is a partition of x, |x| is the cardinal of the set x and the sum runs over all
partitions. for instance, we have:

(2.1.8)

(2.1.9)

and

t2(x, y) = t2(x, y) + t1(x)t1(y) + t1(y)t1(x).

t1(x) = t1(x)

one calls the operator-valued distributions tn anti-chronological products. it is not very hard to
prove that the series (2.1.6) is the inverse of the series (1.0.1) i.e. we have:

s(g) = s(g)1

as formal series. then the unitarity axiom is:

t (x) = t (x),

x.

remark 2.2 one can show that the following relations are identically veried:

x(1)|x|t (x) t (y ) = x(1)|x| t (x)t (y ) = 0

(2.1.10)

(2.1.11)

(2.1.12)

where the sum goes over all partitions x  y = {1, . . . , p}  z, x  y = . also one has,
similarly to (2.1.4):

t (x1x2) = t (x2) t (x1),

x1  x2.

(2.1.13)

a renormalization theory is the possibility to construct such a s-matrix starting from the rst
order term: t1(x) which is a wick polynomial called interaction lagrangian which should verify the
following axioms:

ua,at1(x)u 1

a,a = t1((a)  x + a),
x, y  r4

[t1(x), t1(y)] = 0,

and

t1(x) = t1(x).

a  sl(2, c),

s.t. x  y,

(2.1.14)

(2.1.15)

(2.1.16)

usually, these requirements are supplemented by covariance with respect to some discrete sym-
metries (like spatial and temporal inversions, or pct), charge conjugations or global invariance with
respect to some lie group of symmetry.

it is not easy to nd non-trivial solutions to the set of requirements (2.1.14), (2.1.15) and (2.1.16).
in fact, this is a problem of constructive eld theory. fortunately, if one considers that the hilbert
space of the theory is of fock type, then one has plenty of interesting solutions, namely the wick
polynomials. as underlined in the introduction, this is one of the main reasons of extending the
hilbert space of a gauge system by including ghost elds: there is no other obvious solution of
constructing the interaction lagrangian without them.

5

let us mention for the sake of the completeness the axioms connected with the adiabatic limit,

although we will not use them, as we have said in the introduction.

 let us take in (1.0.1) g  g where   r+ and

then one requires that the limit

g(x)  g(x).

s  lim
0

s(g)

(2.1.17)

(2.1.18)

exists, in the weak sense, and is independent of the the test function g. in other words, the operator
s should depend only on the coupling constant g  g(0). equivalently, one requires that the limits

tn  lim
0

tn(gn



), n  1

(2.1.19)

exists, in the weak sense, and are independent of the test function g. one also calls the limit performed
above, the infrared limit.

 finally, one demands the stability of the vacuum and the stability of the one-particle states i.e.

or,

lim
0

< , s(g) >= 1

< , tn(gn



) >= 0,

n  n

lim
0

if  is the vacuum 0 or any one-particle state.

these two requirement amount for the interaction lagrangian to demand that

t1  lim
0

t1(g)

(2.1.20)

(2.1.21)

(2.1.22)

should exists, in the weak sense, and should be independent of the test function g. moreover, we
should have

< , t1 >= 0

(2.1.23)

if  is the vacuum 0 or any one-particle state.

2.2 epstein-glaser induction

in this subsection we summarize the steps of the inductive construction of epstein and glaser [21].
the main point is a careful formulation of the induction hypothesis. so, we suppose that we have
the interaction lagrangian t1(x) given by a wick polynomial acting in a certain fock space. the
causality property (2.1.15) is then automatically fullled, but we must make sure that we also have
(2.1.14) and (2.1.16).

we suppose that we have constructed the chronological products tp(x1,    , xp),

p = 1, . . . , n  1
having the following properties: (2.1.1), (2.1.4) and (2.1.11) for p  n  1 and (2.1.4) and (2.1.5) for
|x1| + |x2|  n  1. we want to construct the distribution-valued operators t (x),
|x| = n such
that the the properties above go from 1 to n.

here are the main steps of the induction proof.

1. one constructs from t (x),

|x|  n  1 the expressions t (x),

|x|  n  1 according to

(2.1.7) and proves the properties (2.1.13) for |x| + |y |  n  1 and (2.1.12) for |z|  n  1.

2. lemma 2.3

let us denes the expressions:

a

n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  x
n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  x

r

(1)|y |t (x) t (y ),

(1)|y | t (x)t (y )

(2.2.1)

(2.2.2)

y 6= ,

xn  x.

where the sum p goes over the partitions x  y = {1, . . . , n}, x  y = ,

now, let us suppose that we have a partition p  q = {1, . . . , n  1}, p  q = , p 6= .

then:

if qj  p one has:

and if qj  p one has:

a

n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = t (qn)t (p ).

r

n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = t (p )t (qn).

the proof is elementary if one uses the causality properties (2.1.4) and (2.1.13).

3. corollary 2.4 the expression

dn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  a

n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  r

n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn).

(2.2.3)

(2.2.4)

(2.2.5)

have causal support i.e. supp(dn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  +(xn)  (xn) where we use standard
notations:

(xn)  {(x1, . . . , xn)  (r4)n|xi  xn  v ,

i = 1, . . . , n  1}

(2.2.6)

the proof consists of noticing the local character of the support property and reducing all
possible cases to typical situations from the preceding lemma.

7

4. we say that a numerical distribution d(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) is factorizable (or disconnected) if it can

be written as: d(x) = d1(y )d2(z) where y, z is a partition of x.

let us dene the degree of a wick monomial deg(w ) by assigning to every integer spin eld
factor and every derivative the value 1, for every half-integer spin eld factor the value 3/2 and
summing over all factors.

lemma 2.5 the distribution dn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) can be written as a sum

dn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = xi

di(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)wi(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)

(2.2.7)

where wi(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) are linearly independent wick monomials and di(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)
are numerical distributions with causal support i.e supp(di(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  +(xn)(xn).
moreover, the set of wick monomials appearing in the preceding formula can be obtained from the
expression t1(x1)    t1(xn) by taking all possible wick contractions, eliminating the monomials
for for which the corresponding numerical distributions are factorizable and keeping a linearly
independent set.

finally, the following limitations are valid:

(di) + deg(wi)  deg(t1),

i.

(2.2.8)

the proof goes by induction.

5. if d = (di)n

i=1 is a multi-component distribution and sl(2, c)  a  d(a) is an n -dimensional

representation of the group sl(2, c) we dene a new distribution according to:

(a  d)(x)  d(a)d((a1)  x)

and say that the distribution d is sl(2, c)-covariant i it veries:

we remark that we have dened a sl(2, c) action:

a  d = d.

(2.2.9)

(2.2.10)

(a1  a2)  d = a1  (a2  d),

1  d = d.

(2.2.11)

for such multi-component distribution, the order of singularity (d) is, by the denition, the
maximum of the orders of singularities of the components.

lemma 2.6 the distributions di(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) dened above are sl(2, c)-covariant.

the proof follows from the induction hypothesis (2.1.2).

6. now we have the following result from [10], [38]:

8

lemma 2.7 let d be a sl(2, c)-covariant distribution with causal support. then, there exists
a causal splitting

d = a  r,

supp(a)  +(xn),

supp(r)  (xn)

(2.2.12)

which is also sl(2, c)-covariant and such that

(a)  (d), (r)  (d).

(2.2.13)

we outline the proof because the argument is generic and it will also be used for the more general
case of gauge invariance. it is known from the general theory of distribution splitting that there
exists a causal splitting d = a  r preserving the order of singularity. then a  d = a  a  a  r is
a causal splitting of the distribution a  d. because, by hypothesis, we have a  d = d it follows
that we have

a  a  a = a  r  r.

(2.2.14)

but the left hand side has support in +(xn) and the right hand side in (xn) so, the common
value, denoted by pa have the support in +(xn)  (xn) = {(x1,    , xn)  (r4)n|x1 =    =
xn}. but in this case, it is known from the general distribution theory that pa is of the form

pa(x) = p()n1(x)

where

n1(x)  (x1  xn)    (xn1  xn)

(2.2.15)

(2.2.16)

and p is a polynomial in the derivatives of maximal order (d). in particular, if (d) < 0 we
have p = 0 and the causal splitting is sl(2, c)-covariant. if (d)  0 then we easily derive that
pa veries the following identity:

pa1a2 = pa1 + a1  pa2.

(2.2.17)

this relation says that the map a  pa is a sl(2, c)-cocycle with values in the nite dimen-
sional space of polynomials of order not greater than (d). because sl(2, c) is a connected,
simply connected and simple lie group we can apply hochschild lemma [43] and obtain that pa
is of the form

for some polynomial q of order not greater than (d). in particular, we have

pa = a1  q  q

a  (a  q) = a  q

so we have a sl(2, c)-covariant causal splitting d = (a  q)  (r  q). (cid:4)

7. corollary 2.8 there exists a sl(2, c)-covariant causal splitting:

(2.2.18)

(2.2.19)

dn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = an(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  rn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)

(2.2.20)

with supp(an(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  +(xn) and supp(rn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  (xn).
for that reason, the expressions an and rn are called advanced (resp. retarded) products.

9

8. lemma 2.9 the following relation is true

dn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = (1)n1dn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn).

(2.2.21)

in particular the causal splitting obtained above can be chosen such that

an(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = (1)n1an(x1, . . . , xn1; xn).

(2.2.22)

the rst assertion follows by elementary computations starting directly from the denition
(2.2.5) and using the unitarity induction hypothesis (2.1.11) and the relations (2.1.12). this
proves that by performing the substitutions:

an(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) 

rn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) 

1

2 han(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) + (1)n1an(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)i
2 hrn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) + (1)n1rn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)i (2.2.23)

1

we do not aect the relation from the preceding corollary and we obtain a causal splitting
verifying the relation from the statement without spoiling the sl(2, c)-covariance. (cid:4)

9. now we have

theorem 2.10 let us dene

tn(x1,    , xn)  an(x1,    , xn1; xn)  a
 rn(x1,    , xn1; xn)  r

n(x1,    , xn1; xn)
n(x1,    , xn1; xn).

(2.2.24)

then these expressions satisfy the sl(2, c)-covariance, causality and unitarity conditions (2.1.2)
(2.1.4) (2.1.5) and (2.1.11) for p = n. if we substitute

tn(x1,    , xn) 

1

n! x

tn(x(1),    , x(n))

(2.2.25)

where the sum runs over all permutations of the numbers {1, . . . , n} then we also have the
symmetry axiom (2.1.1). the generic expression of the chronological product is similar to that
appearing in lemma 2.5

tn(x1, . . . , xn) = xi

ti(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)wi(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)

(2.2.26)

with the same limitation (2.2.8) on the numerical distributions:

(ti) + deg(wi)  deg(t1),

i.

(2.2.27)

the sl(2, c)-covariance is obvious. the causality axiom (2.1.4) follows from the two expressions
of the denition of tn if one takes into account the support properties of the advanced and
retarded product and also uses lemma 2.3. the property (2.1.5) follows from general properties of
the wick monomials. the unitarity axiom is a result of the denition given above, the property
of the advanced products from the preceding lemma, the expressions a
n and the induction
hypothesis (2.1.11) for p  n  1. the symmetrization process is obvious. (cid:4)

10

as we have mentioned in the introduction the solution of the renormalization problem is not
unique. the non-uniqueness is given by the possibility of adding to the distributions tn some nite
renormalizations nn. there are some restrictions on these nite renormalizations coming from the
poincare invariance and unitarity but still there remains some arbitrariness. one can restrict even
further the arbitrariness requiring the existence of the adiabatic limit. one can prove that this limit
does exists if there are no zero-mass particles in the spectrum of the energy-momentum quadri-vector.

11

2.3 perturbation theory for zero-mass particles

we remind the basic facts about the quantization of the photon; for more details see [25] and refer-
ences quoted there. let us denote the hilbert space of the photon by hphoton; it carries the unitary
representation of the orthochronous poincare group h[0,1]  h[0,1] (see [43]).

the hilbert space of the multi-photon system should be, according to the basic principles of the
second quantization, the associated symmetric fock space fphoton  f +(hphoton). one can construct
in a rather convenient way this fock space in the spirit of algebraic quantum eld theory. one considers
the hilbert space hgh generated by applying on the vacuum 0 the free elds a(x),
u(x)
called the electromagnetic potential (reps. ghosts) which are completely characterize by the following
properties:

inversion in the minkowski space r4. let ua,a, uis be the unitary operators realizing the
sl(2, c) transformations and the spatial inversion respectively and uit the anti-unitary operator
realizing the temporal inversion; then we require:

ua,aa(x)u 1

a,a = (a1)
a,a = u((a)  x + a), ua,a u(x)u 1

a,a = u((a)  x + a)

 charge invariance. the unitary operator realizing the charge conjugation veries:

uc a(x)u 1

c = a(x), ucu(x)u 1

c = u(x), uc u(x)u 1

c = u(x).

(2.3.7)

 moreover, we suppose that these operators are leaving the vacuum invariant:

ua,a0 = 0, uis0 = 0, uit0 = 0, uc0 = 0.

(2.3.8)

12

remark 2.11 one can easily prove that the operators ua,a, uis and uit are realizing a projective
representation of the poincare group i.e. they have suitable commutation properties (see [43] rel. (196)
from ch. ix. 6). also the charge conjugation operator commutes with these operators. (as it is well
known, there is some freedom in choosing some phases in the denitions of the spatial and temporal
inversions [43]; we have made the convenient choice which ensures this commutativity property).

we suppose that in hgh we have, beside the scalar product, a sesqui-linear form < ,  > and
we denote the conjugate of the operator o with respect to this form by o. one can completely
characterize this form by requiring:

a(x) = a(x),

u(x) = u(x),

u(x) = u(x).

(2.3.9)

now, we dene in hgh an important operator called supercharge according to:

q = zr3

d3xa(x)


0 u(x)

and one can prove the following properties:

q0 = 0

(2.3.10)

(2.3.11)

and

{q, u(x)} = 0,

{q, u(x)} = ia(x),

[q, a(x)] = iu(x).

(2.3.12)

from these properties one can derive

so we also have

q2 = 0;

im(q)  ker(q).

(2.3.13)

(2.3.14)

next, we denote by w the linear space of all wick monomials acting in the fock space hgh

generated by the elds a(x), u(x) and u(x).

remark 2.12 we notice that usually one constructs wick monomials by rst decomposing every the
free elds in a creation and an annihilation parts and then ordering the creation parts to the left with
respect to the annihilation parts (with the corresponding jordan sign if fermion elds are present).
however, there is a way to dene wick monomials without this decomposition, by a substraction
procedure [40] pg. 104; for instance:

: a(x)a (x) : limx1,x2x[a(x1)a (x2)  (0, a(x1)a (x2)0)]

(2.3.15)

if m is such a wick monomial, we dene by gh(m ) the degree in u (resp.

in u). the ghost

number is, by denition, the expression:

then we dene the operator:

gh(m )  gh+(m )  gh(m ).

dqm : qm : (1)gh(m ) : m q :

(2.3.16)

(2.3.17)

13

on monomials m and extend it by linearity to the whole w. the operator dq : w  w is called the
brst operator; its properties are following elementary from the properties of the supercharge: beside
the leibnitz rule we have:

dqu = 0,

dq u = ia,

dqa = iu

(2.3.18)

and is a linearized version of the usual brst transform [44]. nevertheless, as a consequence of (2.3.13),
it veries:

d2
q = 0.

(2.3.19)

now one can prove that for any wick monomial w we have:

ug(dqw )u 1

g = dqugw u 1

g

,

g = (a, a), is, it, c.

(2.3.20)

the proof of this relation is elementary if w is one of the basic elds a,
it by induction for a wick monomial with an arbitrary number of factors. as a corollary we have:

u. then one extends

u,

ugq = qug,

g = (a, a), is, it, c.

(2.3.21)

then we have the central result

theorem 2.13 the sesqui-linear form < ,  > factorizes to a well-dened scalar product on the com-
pletion of the factor space ker(q)/im(q). then there exists the following hilbert spaces isomorphism:

ker(q)/im(q)  fphoton;

(2.3.22)

the representation of the poincare group and the charge conjugation operator are factorizing to
ker(q)/im(q) and are producing unitary operators with the exception of the temporal (and spatio-
temporal) inversions which are anti-unitary.

we will need the following relation in the next section:

(dqw ) = (1)gh(w )dq(w )

(2.3.23)

valid for any wick monomial. the proof is similar to the proof of (2.3.20): one shows elementary that
the relation is true for any of the basic elds a,
u and extends it to an arbitrary product by
induction.

u,

we remind that if o is a self-adjoint operator verifying the condition

dqo = 0

(2.3.24)

then it induces a well dened operator [o] on the factor space ker(q)/im(q)  fphoton. this kind
of observables on the physical space are called gauge invariant observables. however, the operators
of the type dqo are inducing a null operator on the factor space, so are not interesting. for more
general considerations on this point see [8].

usually one has to add into the game matter elds. these are operators for which one has to give
separately the corresponding canonical (anti)commutation relations and transformation rules with
respect to the poincare group and charge conjugation. by denition, we keep the same expression
for the supercharge and construct the physical hilbert space by the same factorization procedure. in
particular, this will mean that the brst operator acts trivially on the matter elds.

14

we can formulate now what we mean by a perturbation theory of electromagnetism + matter.
by denition, this means that we can construct in hgh the set of chronological products tn as in the
subsection 2.1 and we impose in addition a factorization condition to the physical hilbert space. to
avoid infra-red divergence problems, we adopt as said in the introduction the condition (1.0.3) which
we prefer to write into the form:

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) = i

n

xl=1


x
l

t 
n/l(x1, . . . , xn),

n  n

(2.3.25)

for some wick polynomials tn/l,

l = 1, . . . n.

by denition, this is the gauge invariance condition. it can be connected with the usual approaches

based on the ward identities imposed on the (renormalized) feynman distributions.

let us note that the wick polynomials tn/l,
usually, one can extend the denition of the various symmetries of the theory (poincare covariance
and charge conjugation invariance) to the case of electromagnetism + matter in such a way that all
the properties mentioned before remain true.

l = 1, . . . n, if they exists, are highly non-unique.

15

3 renormalizability of quantum electrodynamics

3.1 the interaction lagrangian

by denition, in this case the matter eld is a dirac eld of mass m denoted by (x) = (x)4
=1. to
describe this eld we need dirac matrices ,  = 0, . . . , 3 for which we prefer the chiral represen-
tation [43]:

0 = (cid:18) 0 1

1 0(cid:19) ,

i = (cid:18) 0 i

0 (cid:19) ,

i

i = 1, 2, 3;

(3.1.1)

i = 1, 2, 3 are the pauli matrices. this is a representations in which the matrix 5 

here i,
i0123 is diagonal:

5 = (cid:18) 1

0 1(cid:19) .

0

(3.1.2)

we denote as usual (x)  (x)0; it is convenient to consider  ( ) as a column (line) vector.

as before, the dirac eld is characterized by:

 equation of motion (which is, of course the dirac equation):

(i   + m)(x) = 0.

(3.1.3)

 canonical (anti)commutation relations:

[(x), a(y)] = 0,

{(x), (y)} = 0,

[(x), u(y)] = 0,

[(x), u(y)] = 0
{(x), (y)} = sm(x  y)  1;

here sm, m  0 is a 4  4 matrix given by:

sm(x)  (i   + m)dm(x).

 covariance properties with respect to the poincare group:

uis(x)u 1

is = i0(is  x), uit(x)u 1

it = i13(is  x);

uc(x)u 1

c = 02 (x)t.

(3.1.4)

(3.1.5)

(3.1.6)

(3.1.7)

(3.1.8)

these relations should be added to the ones from the preceding subsection. it can be proved that

remark 2.11 stays true.

by denition, the interaction lagrangian is:

t1(x)  e : (x)(x) : a(x)

(3.1.9)

16

(here e is the electron charge) and one can verify easily that the properties (2.1.14), (2.1.15) and
(2.1.16) are true. moreover, we have (2.3.25) for n = 1 with

t 
1/1(x)  e : (x)(x) : u(x).

(3.1.10)

we list below some obvious properties of the preceding expressions which are similar to the prop-

erties (2.1.14), (2.1.15) and (2.1.16):

uist 

ua,at 
1/1(x)u 1

1/1(y)i = 0,

a  sl(2, c),

1/1(x)u 1

it = (is)

t 

1/1(it  x),

x, y  r4

s.t. x  y

and

to these one must add charge conjugation invariance:

uct 

1/1(x)u 1

c = t 

1/1(x).

(3.1.11)

(3.1.12)

(3.1.13)

(3.1.14)

these properties can be easily deduced from the denitions of the various symmetry transforma-

tions and the explicit expression (3.1.10).

from the explicit expressions of the second order chronological product obtained in [38] one can

verify that we have similar relations in the second order of perturbation theory.

we close by mentioning that properties (2.3.20), (2.3.21) and (2.3.23) remain true.

17

3.2 gauge invariance of quantum electrodynamics

in this subsection we prove the following theorem.

theorem 3.1 suppose that t1 is given by (3.1.9) above. then the distributions tn can be con-
structed such that, beside the conditions of symmetry, sl(2, c)-covariance, causality and unitarity
(2.1.1), (2.1.2), (2.1.4), (2.1.11), also verify covariance with respect to spatial and temporal inver-
sions, invariance to charge conjugation and gauge invariance:

uistn(x1, . . . , xn)u 1

is = tn(is  x1, . . . , is  xn),

uittn(x1, . . . , xn)u 1

it = tn(it  x1, . . . , it  xn),

where t

proof:

l = 1, . . . , n are some wick monomials.

(i) the main trick is to formulate carefully the induction hypothesis. we suppose that we
have constructed the chronological products tp(x1,    , xp),
p = 1, . . . , n  1 having the following
properties: (2.1.1), (2.1.4) and (2.1.11) for p  n  1, (2.1.4) and (2.1.5) for |x1| + |x2|  n  1 and

gh(tp) = gh( tp) = 0

(3.2.5)

for p  n  1.

we also suppose that we have constructed the wick polynomials tp/l(x1,    , xp),

l = 1, . . . , p
for p = 1, . . . , n  1 such that we have properties analogue to (2.1.1), (2.1.4) and (2.1.11). we use a
convention similar to (2.1.3): if x = {1, . . . , p} we denote t 
l  p and we
assume that:

p/l(x1, . . . , xp),

l (x)  t 

l (x)  0,
then the induction hypothesis is supplemented as follows.

t ()  1,

(3.2.12)

where x1,    , xr is a partition of x and we use in an essential way the convention (3.2.6). we
require

t 
l (x) = t 

l (x),

for |x|  n  1;

 gauge invariance:

dqt (x) = ixlx

l (x)) = 1,

gh(t

for |x|  n  1.

(ii) we observe that the induction hypothesis is valid for p = 1 according to (i). we suppose that

it is true for p  n  1 and prove it for p = n.

first we establish in analogy to (2.1.12) that we have:

x(1)|x|(cid:2)t 

l (x) t (y ) + t (x) t 

l (y )(cid:3) = 0 = x(1)|x|(cid:2) t 

l (x)t (y ) + t (x)t 

(3.2.16)

l (y )(cid:3) .

where the sum goes over all partitions x, y with |x| + |y |  n  1.

also one has, similarly to (2.1.13):

t 
l (xy ) = t 

l (y ) t (x) + t (y ) t 

l (x),

x  y.

(3.2.17)

and |x| + |y |  n  1.

finally, from (3.2.4) and the denitions of the antichronological products t (x) and t (x) we

have

for all |x|  n  1.

dq t (x) = ixlx


x
l

t 
l (x),

(3.2.18)

now we can proceed in strict analogy with subsection 2.2. the proof of the following items below
goes in strict analogy to the proof of the similar statements from the previous subsection and can be
easily provided with minimal modications.

19

1. one constructs from t (x),

|x|  n1
and proves the properties (2.1.13) + (3.2.17) for |x| + |y |  n  1 and (2.1.12) + (3.2.16) for
|x|  n  1.

|x|  n1 the expressions t (x),

t 
l (x),

t 
l (x),

2. beside lemma 2.3 we have the following result:

3. lemma 3.2 let us denes the expressions:

a

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  x
n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  x

l (y )(cid:3)
l (y )(cid:3)

(3.2.19)

(3.2.20)

y 6= ,

xn  x.

now, let us suppose that we have a partition p  q = {1, . . . , n  1}, p  q = , p 6= .

then:

if qj  p one has:

a

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = (cid:2)t 

l (qn)t (p ) + t (qn)t 

l (p )(cid:3)

and if qj  p one has:

r

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = (cid:2)t 

l (p )t (qn) + t (p )t 

l (qn)(cid:3) .

(3.2.21)

(3.2.22)

the proof is similar to the proof of lemma 2.3 if one uses the causality properties (3.2.10) and
(3.2.17).

4. beside corollary 2.4 we have:

corollary 3.3 the expression

d

n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  a

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  r

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn).

(3.2.23)

have causal support i.e. supp(d

n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  +(xn)  (xn).

the proof goes exactly as the proof of the corollary 2.4.

5. in lemma 2.5 we must use the fact that dim(t1) = 4; we also have the generalization:

lemma 3.4 the distribution d
n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = xi
d

n(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) can be written as a sum

dq
i (x1, . . . , xn1; xn)w q

i (x1, . . . , xn1; xn)

(3.2.24)

i (x1, . . . , xn1; xn) are linearly independent wick monomials and dq

with w q
i (x1, . . . , xn1; xn)
numerical distributions with causal support i.e supp(dq
i (x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  +(xn)  (xn).
moreover, the set of wick monomials appearing in the preceding formula can be obtained from the
expression t1(x1)    t 
l (xi)    tn(xn) by taking all possible wick contractions, eliminating the

20

monomials for for which the corresponding numerical distributions are factorizable and keeping
a linearly independent set.

finally, the following limitations are valid:

(dq

i ) + deg(w q

i )  deg(t1) = 4,

i.

(3.2.25)

6. corollary 3.5 there exists a sl(2, c)-covariant causal splitting:

d

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = a

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  r

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn/l)

(3.2.26)

with supp(a
l = 1, . . . , n.

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  +(xn) and supp(r

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  (xn) for all

the proof goes as in the case of the distribution dn if one notices that the distributions
dq
i (x1, . . . , xn1; xn) dened above are sl(2, c)-covariant. for this reason an(rn) are called
advanced (resp. retarded) products.

7. beside lemma 2.9 we have

lemma 3.6 the following relation is true

d

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = (1)n1d

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn).

(3.2.27)

in particular the causal splitting obtained above can be chosen such that

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) = (1)n1a
a

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn).

(3.2.28)

so, performing the substitutions:

a

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) 

r

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) 

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) + (1)n1a
n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn) + (1)n1r

1

2 ha
2 hr

1

n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)i
n/l(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)i(3.2.29)

for all l = 1, . . . , n we do not aect the relation from the preceding corollary and we obtain
a causal splitting verifying the condition from the statement without spoiling the sl(2, c)-
covariance. (cid:4)

8. now we have again theorem 2.10 and also

theorem 3.7 let us dene

t 
n/l(x1,    , xn)  a
 r

n/l(x1,    , xn1; xn)  a
n/l(x1,    , xn1; xn)  r

n/l(x1,    , xn1; xn)
n/l(x1,    , xn1; xn).

(3.2.30)

21

then these expressions satisfy the poincare covariance, causality and unitarity conditions (3.2.8)
(3.2.10) (3.2.11) and (3.2.13) for p = n. if we substitute

tn(x1,    , xn) 

1

tn(x(1),    , x(n)),

n! x
t 
n/1(l)(x(1),    , x(n))

t 
n/l(x1,    , xn)

n! x

(3.2.31)

where the sum runs over all permutations of the numbers {1, . . . , n} then we also have the
symmetry axioms (2.1.1) and (3.2.7) for p = n. finally, if we substitute

t (x) 

1

2 ht (x) + t (x)i ,

t 
l (x) 

we have charge conjugation invariance as well.

(3.2.32)

(iii) now we investigate the possible obstruction to the extension of the identity (3.2.4) for |x| = n.

proposition 3.8 the following relation is valid:

dqt (x) = ixlx


x
l

t 
l (x) + p (x),

|x| = n

(3.2.33)

where p (x)  pn(x1, . . . , xn) is a wick polynomial (called anomaly) of the following structure:

pn(x) = xi

pi()n1(x)w q

i (x);

here pi are polynomials in the derivatives with the maximal degree restricted by

deg(pi) + deg(w q

i )  5.

moreover, we have the following properties:

1. symmetry

(3.2.34)

(3.2.35)

pn(x(1), . . . , x(n)) = pn(x1, . . . , xn)

(3.2.36)

for any permutation   pn.

2. sl(2, c)-covariance:

n/l(x1, . . . , xn),

(3.2.41)

(3.2.42)

we substitute here the causal decompositions (2.2.20) and (3.2.26) in the preceding relation and

we get:

n

dqan(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  i

n/l(x1, . . . , xn) =

r

n/l(x1, . . . , xn).

(3.2.43)

now we can reasons as in lemma 2.7 - see formula (2.2.14) : the left hand side has support in
+(xn) and the right hand side in (xn) so the common value, denoted by pn should have the
support in +(xn)  (xn) = {x1 =    = xn}. this means that we have:

dqan(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  i

n

xl=1

(3.2.44)

where p 
n has the structure (3.2.34) from the statement. we now have immediately the relation (3.2.33)
from the statement where pn has the structure (3.2.34). the limitation (3.2.35) follows rather easily
from the lemmas 2.5 and 3.4. the same is true for the ghost number restriction (3.2.40). the
restrictions (3.2.36) and (3.2.38) follow from the similar properties of the products t (x) and t 
l (x)
from the preceding proposition.

for unitarity we proceed as follows. first, we apply the brst operator dq to the relation (2.1.12)
with z  xy of cardinal n. if we use the induction hypothesis (3.2.4) and (3.2.18) + (3.2.33) we get:

dq t (x) = ixlx

t 
l (x) + p (x),

|x| = n

(3.2.45)

where

pn  (1)n1pn.

(3.2.46)

now we apply the conjugation  to the relation (3.2.4), use the relation (2.3.23) and compare to

the relation (3.2.45): the relation (3.2.39) follows.

the fact that the polynomials pi from (3.2.34) do not contain the matrix 5 follows by induc-
tion: one proves in this way that all the numerical distributions appearing in the expressions of
d(x), d

|x| = n do not contain this matrix.

l (x),

the structure of the wick monomials w q

i detailed in the last two items of the statement is proved

by induction as well. 

(iv) there are a lot of restrictions on the anomaly pn and we will be able to prove here that it can
be chosen to be equal to 0. first, from the restrictions (3.2.35)) and the sl(2, c)-covariance (3.2.37)
we obtain that

(3.2.49)

it is obvious that all these polynomials also verify individually all the restrictions from the preceding
proposition. in particular, charge conjugation invariance gives immediately:

pi = 0,

i = 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17.

(3.2.50)

we analyse now the other cases. the basic idea is to perform obvious integrations by parts and
exhibit the polynomials as follows:

pi(x) = +i

n

xl=1


x
l

n 

l (x) + p 

i(x)

where the wick monomials n 

l verify the following equation:

(n 

l ) = (1)n1n 
l .

then we make the redenition

t 
n/l  t 

n/l + n,

t 
n/l  t 

n/l + (1)n1n 

l

(3.2.51)

(3.2.52)

(3.2.53)

without aecting the properties of the expressions t (x),
eliminate immediately some of the monomials from the list (3.2.48). in this way one can eliminate:

|x| = n. in this way one can

t 
l (x),

 p7 by redening p6;

 p9 and p10 by redening p8;

 p13 by redening p12;

 p16 by redening p15.

in all these cases the property (3.2.52) follows easily from (3.2.39).

we analyse now the remaining cases.
1) in this case we have the following generic form of the numerical distribution:

p
ijl(x) = xijl

kijln1(x).

(3.2.54)

this means that we have:

p1(x) = kn1(x)

: (xn)(xn) : u(xn).

(3.2.55)

25

from (3.2.39) one nds out that

now one sees that

where

k = (1)nk.

p1 = dqn

n (x) = kn1(x)

: (xn)(xn) : a(xn)

veries, because of (3.2.56), the relation

n (x) = (1)n1n (x).

it means that we can make the substitutions

(3.2.56)

(3.2.57)

(3.2.58)

(3.2.59)

t (x)  t (x) + n (x),

t (x)  t (x) + (1)n1n (x)

(3.2.60)

without modifying the properties of the chronological products. but in this way we will have p1 = 0.
2), 3) 4) in the rst two cases the structure of the numerical distributions q and r is similar to the
structure (3.2.54) above. if we use in the rst two cases dirac equation (3.1.3) it follows that the sum
of these two contributions is of the form:

p0(x) = kn1(x)

: (xn)(xn) : u(xn).

in the case 4) we have the generic form

pijl(x) = xijl

(kijl1 + kijlm  m) n1(x).

(3.2.61)

(3.2.62)

(where in the sum the values of the indices i, j, k must be distinct.) we integrate by parts, make the
redenition (3.2.53) and conclude that we can take

p4(x) = n1(x)w (xn)

(3.2.63)

where the wick monomial w is of the following type:

w (x) = {k1 : [ (x)](x) : +k2 : (x)[(x)] :}u(x) + k3 : (x)(x) : u(x)

(3.2.64)

in the rst two terms we use dirac equation (3.1.3). in the end we obtain that p4 can be taken of
the form p0. now it follows by elementary computations that charge conjugation invariance imposes
p0 = 0.

5) in this case, the numerical distributions p...

... have the same structure as in the case 1) so we end

up with

p5(x) = n1(x) k : (xn)(xn) : a(xn)u(xn).

(3.2.65)

this contribution is zero because of the charge conjugation invariance.

8) in this case we have

p(x) = xi


ci

i +xijk

dijk

i j  k + d

ijkijk

 n1(x).

(3.2.66)

26

by integrations by parts it follows that we can take p8 = 0 of the form (3.2.63):

p8(x) = n1(x)w (xn)

(3.2.67)

where the wick monomial w is of the following type (use of the equations of motion must be made):

w (x) = c1(a)u + c2au + c3(a)(u) + c4( a)( u)

(3.2.68)

which can be exhibited in the form (3.2.57):

w = dqn

with

n = i(cid:20)c1 : uu : 

1
2

c2 : aa : 

1
2

c3 : ( a)( a) : +c4 : ( u)u) :(cid:21)

(3.2.69)

(3.2.70)

so, we can make the redenition (3.2.60) and put p8 = 0. in this way the new chronological products
|x| = n will have terms with ghosts which however can be put to zero: we take c1, c4  0
t (x),
and we do not aect the properties of the chronological products.

14) in this case we have

p(x) = xi (cid:16)cig 

i + fii(cid:17) n1(x).

i + dig

i + eig 

if we integrate by parts, we get a formula of the type (3.2.63)

p14(x) = n1(x)w (xn)

with w of the following form:

(3.2.71)

(3.2.72)

w (x) = k1 : aa(a) : u + k2 : aaa : u + k3 : aa(a) : u

(3.2.73)

on can get rid of the last term by redening the rst two ones. but in the case k3 = 0 we have

with

w = dqn

n = i(cid:18)k2 : aa uu : 

1
4

k1 : aaaa :(cid:19)

so, we can make p14 = 0 as in the case 8).

15) in this case we have

p(x) = (cid:16)k1g g + k2gg + k3gg + k4(cid:17) n1(x).

so

p12(x) = cn1(x)w (xn)

where w is of the form (3.2.57) with

n = 

i
4

: aaaa :

and we can proceed as at 1).

in conclusion, we can make in (3.2.4) pn = 0. this nishes the proof. (cid:4)

(3.2.74)

(3.2.75)

(3.2.76)

(3.2.77)

(3.2.78)

27

remark 3.9 we can x the covariance properties with respect to the spatial and temporal inversions
as in [38] ch. 4.4.

we now determine the non-unicity of the chronological products t (x). we have:

proposition 3.10 suppose that t (x) and t (x) are two solutions of the renormalization theory for
quantum electrodynamics, verifying gauge invariance in the sense of the preceding theorem and the
power counting condition (2.2.27). then we have

t (x)  t (x) = dqn (x) + ixlx


x
l

n 

l (x) + cn1(x) : (xn)(xn) : a(xn)

(3.2.79)

with inc  r. in particular, we can absorb the last term in the interaction lagrangian by redening
the coupling constant up to order n.

proof: from the gauge invariance condition, the expression f (x)  t (x)  t (x) veries:

dqf (x) = ixlx


x
l

f 
l (x)

for some wick polynomials f 

l (x). now we have from lemma 2.5

f (x) = xi

fi(x)wi(x)

with the numerical distributions of the form

fi(x) = pi()n1(x)

where pi are polynomials verifying the restrictions

deg(pi) + deg(wi)  deg(t1) = 4,

i.

(3.2.80)

(3.2.81)

(3.2.82)

(3.2.83)

we also have all the properties of symmetry, covariance with respect to sl(2, c) and charge
conjugation invariance. we list all polynomials fullling these requirements and we obtain the result.
(cid:4)

remark 3.11 the possibility of redening the charge such that the last term in (3.2.79) disappears
is named charge renormalization. we see that, in a rigorous version of the renormalization theory
there is no mass renormalization, because one starts from the very beginning in a denite fock space
where the dirac particle has a xed mass m.

remark 3.12 it is plausible that some descent equations of the type:

dqt 1,...,k
l1,...,lk

= i xlk+16=l1,...,lk



xk+1
k+1

t 1,...,k+1
l1,...,lk+1

,

k  n

(3.2.84)

can be established by rening the induction hypothesis. such formul could be useful in more compli-
cated theories.

28

we close this section with a comparison between our proof and the proof appearing in [38], ch. 4.6.
in this reference one works in a quantization formalism for the electromagnetic eld without ghosts.
one can prove, also by induction, a more precise formula for the chronological products:

tn(x1, . . . , xn) xi,j,k

: yii

(xi)tk

i,j,k(x)yjj

(xj ) :: ykk

ak (xk) :

(3.2.85)

where: a) the sum runs over all distinct triplets i, j, k  {1, . . . , n} verifying |i| = |j|; b) by k we
mean the set {k}kk ; c) the expression tk
i,j,k are numerical distributions (in fact, they take values
in the matrix space mc(4, 4)|i|.)

the possibility of having non-zero intersection between the sets i, j and k is permitted. the
condition of gauge invariance (3.2.4) can be translated into conditions on these numerical distributions
tk
i,j,k which are the famous ward-takahashi identities. they have a rather complicated form precisely
because of the possible non-void intersections mentioned above. in fact, the proof from [38] relies on
the following identities for which we did not found an elementary proof. formula (4.6.36) from this
reference is a particular case of the formul below.

tk

j 6 j, |i| < n,

i,j,kl(x xl)   i 6 i  j, |i| < n.

(3.2.86)

4 conclusions

we have succeed to give complete proof of the renormalizability of the quantum electrodynamics. it
is much simpler that the proofs from the literature based on the usual brst transformation (see [44]
and literature quoted there). its main advantages, beside the conceptual clearness, are:

1. the role of feynman graphs is minimal (only in writing wick theorem);

2. we circumvent the problem of the so-called 1-particle reducible graphs (see the end of the pre-

ceding subsection.

it is an interesting problem to extend this analysis to the case of the standard model. this was done
in a series of papers [9], [10], [13],[13] using beside epstein-glaser approach some rather complicated
identities (the so-called c-g identities) and group theoretical analysis. it is to be expected that our
method could simplify somewhat the analysis of this model and of other gauge models of physical
interest from the literature. we propose to do this in future papers.

it is natural to expect that this approach to renormalization theory gives the same result as the
usual procedure of becchi, rouet, stora and tyutin. a proof of this fact based on the quantum
noether method [33] appears in [3]. however, we can give here a much simpler argument.
it is
clear that both approaches verify the same set of axioms so one can use the characterization of the
non-uniqueness given above.
