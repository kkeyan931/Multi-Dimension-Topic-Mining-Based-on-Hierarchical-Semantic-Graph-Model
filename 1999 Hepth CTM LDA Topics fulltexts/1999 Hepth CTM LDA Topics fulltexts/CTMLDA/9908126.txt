(17) seen above, two bps states (16) correspond, dual type iia theory, two fractional bps d-particles localised dierent xed planes, opposite bulk charge. non-bps state (15) therefore corresponds non-bps d-string stretches pair xed planes; terms boundary states non-bps state described |d1nonbps; , = + conventions, state also independently constructed sen {$9812031$}; compare also sens contribution proceedings. 2(cid:16)|t 1; 1irr + ei|t 2; 2irr(cid:17)(cid:21) . 2(cid:20)|u1; sn + h = 1/2.

(21) indeed, former inequality violated, open string spectrum (20) contains tachyon unit kk momentum x4 direction; latter inequality violated, spectrum contains tachyon unit winding x1, x2, x3 direction. inequalities also determined comparing mass d-string pair fractional bps d-particles former case, pair fractional bps d2-branes latter. domains stability (17) (21) qualitatively related duality map (9). since states question bps, masses protected quantum corrections, one expect regimes stability match exactly. 3.2. t-duality t-duality relates non-bps d-string (18) type iia orbifold non-bps d- particle type iib 4/(1)fli4 . (under s-duality, orbifold related non-bps dirichlet branes 8 orientifold type iib 4 i4 {$9803194$}, non-bps d-particle corresponds rst excited state string stretches d5-brane mirror .) seen above, non-bps d-string decay two bps d- particles sit opposite ends d-string carry opposite bulk charge. t-duality, conguration corresponds bps d-string anti-d-string carry relative wilson line. analysis therefore gives support claim non-bps d-particle indeed described terms brane-anti-brane pair {$9805019$}. 3.3. non-bps states heterotic string theory also contains stable non-bps states correspond d-branes iia orbifold. simplest examples states transform spinor representation so(32). = 10 states identied zz2-valued non-bps d-particle dual type string . sequence duality transformations relate heterotic string 4 type iia k3 (7) suggests six dimensions states correspond non-bps (non-dirichlet) 4-brane, may understood bound state ns5-brane anti-ns5-brane. one also compare non-bps states necessarily stable. example, heterotic theory contains states charged respect single u(1) associated one xed plane dual iia orbifold, uncharged respect u(1); one state form pr =(cid:0)04(cid:1) . pl =(cid:0)2, 2, 016; 04(cid:1) , (22) mass state mh = 26, actually unstable heterotic theory. indeed, (22) decay four bps states form p (1) p (1) l = (1, 0, 1, 013; 0, 0, 1/(2rh3), 0) r = (0, 0, 1/(2rh3), 0) p (2) p (1) l = (1, 0,1, 013; 0, 0,1/(2rh3), 0) r = (0, 0,1/(2rh3), 0) p (3) p (3) l = (0, 1, 0, 1, 012; 0, 0, 1/(2rh3), 0) r = (0, 0, 1/(2rh3), 0) p (4) p (4) l = (0, 1, 0,1, 012; 0, 0,1/(2rh3), 0) r = (0, 0,1/(2rh3), 0) .
