(4.8) however, case transformations fi not, general, correctly induced transformations . case f ( s) = (ic + d)2 f (s) , (4.9) f (s) = f (1)(s)/s. implies f (s) must transform s-duality trans- formations modular form weight 2. heterotic-like string compactications, wilsonian coupling function f (1)(s) expan- sion type f (1)(s) = ic1 + f (q), f (q) denotes series expansion positive powers q = exp(2s) c1 constant appearing (2.1) (actually, n = 2 heterotic string compactications function f general also receive perturbative corrections de- pend moduli = iy a/y 0. discuss perturbative corrections). well known holomorphic f (1)(s) satisfying (4.9). thus, holomorphic wilsonian coupling function consistent s-duality. this, however, pose problem, since presence massless elds wilsonian coupling functions 15 not, general, exhibit invariances physical eective coupling functions. order obtain coupling function consistent (4.9), give holomorphicity, characteristic feature wilsonian couplings, assume f (1) depends s. so, still preserve stabilization equations (where fi remain given f/y ) moreover (classical) target-space duality invariance remains intact. non-holomorphic f (1)(s, s) satises (4.9) weak coupling limit (cid:0)log 2(s) + log(s + s)(cid:1), turns f (1)(s, s) ic1 given f (1)(s, s) = ic1 f (s, s) = isf (1)(s, s) = c1 2 g2(s, s), g2(s, s) = g2(s) 2/(s + s) {$9711053$}). stress f (1) determined g2(s) = 4 log (s) (see, e.g. anti-holomorphic function s, suppressed view fact vanish weak coupling. thus, function f consistent s-duality given (4.1) f (1)(s) replaced f (1)(s, s). note f (1)(s, s) invariant (4.8), rather transforms f (1)(s, s) f (1)(s, s) + ic1 let us turn entropy calculation using denitions stabilization equation entropy before, f (1)(s) replaced f (1)(s, s). first determine |z|2 = pi fi (y, , ) qi . following steps section 2 obtain (4.10) log(ic + d). 6 3 6 |z|2 = (s + s)h 1 2 hn, ni + (f (s, s) + h.c.)i , reduces (2.6) weak coupling limit . value dilaton horizon is, principle, determined terms charges mi n carried black hole stabilization equations (1.4). again, following steps section 2, nd hn, ni = hm, mi 2(s + s)(f (s, s) + h.c.) , (s s)hn, ni = 2i n + 2 (s + s) (f (s, s) h.c.) . two equations combined f (s, s) = 1 4 1 (s + s)2 (mi 2i ik n k) ij (mj 2i jln l) .
