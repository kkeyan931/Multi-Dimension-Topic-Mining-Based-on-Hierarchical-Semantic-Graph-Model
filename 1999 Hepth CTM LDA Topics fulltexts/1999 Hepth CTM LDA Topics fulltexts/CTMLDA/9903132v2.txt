abstract

we determine the thermodynamic stability conditions for near-extreme
rotating d3, m5, and m2-branes with multiple angular momenta. critical
exponents near the boundary of stability are discussed and compared with
a naive eld theory model. from a partially numerical computation we
conclude that outside the boundary of stability, the angular momentum
density tends to become spatially inhomogeneous.

periodic euclidean spinning brane solutions have been studied as mod-
els of qcd. we explain how supersymmetry is restored in the world-
volume eld theory in a limit where spin becomes large compared to
total energy. we discuss the hierarchy of energy scales that develops as
this limit is approached.

i. introduction

mathematically, thermodynamic stability is equated with the subadditivity of the
entropy function. more precisely, suppose the entropy s is known in the microcanonical
ensemble as a function of the other extensive thermodynamic variables (like energy and
charge), which we will collectively denote xi. subadditivity of the function s({xi}) is
the condition

s({xi + (1  )xi})  s({xi}) + (1  )s({xi}) .

(1)

if the inequality went the other way, then the system could gain entropy by dividing
into two parts, one with a fraction  of the energy, charge, etc., and the other with a
fraction 1 . when the system satises (1), no such process is allowed by the second
law of thermodynamics, and it is in this sense that the system is thermodynamically
stable.

for black holes, perhaps a better way to think of (1) (though a more heuristic one)
is as follows: (1) is satised for all xi and xi in a suciently small neighborhood of a
given point in phase space if and only if it is possible for a black hole at that point
to exist in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath much larger than itself. a simple
example would be the reissner-nordstrom black hole in four-dimensional einstein-
maxwell theory with no electrically charged particles. near extremality, the specic
heat is positive, but far from extremality the specic heat is negative. if one starts
with the black hole in a state with positive specic heat and a temperature close to the
temperature of some thermal gas of gravitons and photons, then the black hole will
equilibrate with the thermal gas. on the other hand, if the black hole was in a state
of negative specic heat, then even if its temperature is arbitrarily close to that of the
thermal gas, the black hole will either emit faster than it absorbs or absorb faster than
it emits, and correspondingly get smaller and hotter or bigger and colder. there is no
bound on the runaway phenomenon except for the black hole to make the transition to
positive specic heat or else to absorb most of the matter in the universe (assuming the
universe is nite). that is what one means by instability of the initial conguration.1
for spinning d- or m-branes, the heat bath line of reasoning is questionable be-
cause it is not clear whether one can construct an appropriate heat bath. one could
perform the following gedanken experiment. start with an array of nearly identical
parallel spinning branes distributed through space, and ask whether, as they trade

1in this discussion we have assumed that the jeans instability of the thermal gas is
insignicantthat is, it enters into the problem with a much longer time-scale than the
time scale of equilibration between the black hole and the thermal gas.

hawking radiation among themselves, there is a process of equilibration or disequili-
bration among them. this is the standard trick of constructing an ensemble out of
replicas of a given system. the branes should equilibrate precisely when (1) is sat-
ised. however, there is a diculty: one has to estimate whether the time scale of
equilibration or disequilibration is faster or slower than the time scale on which the
gravitational forces between the replicas appreciably distort the array. near the phase
transition of [1], one expects the equilibration time scale to diverge, so the gedanken
experiment will become impractical (even by the standards of gedanken experiments)
close enough to the transition.

as a rst step we can think of a single cluster of near-extreme coincident branes
in a decoupling limit of the theory, where hawking radiation to the asymptotically
at region of spacetime is very slow. once we have analyzed the criterion (1) and
established the existence of unstable solutions (even in this near-extreme decoupling
limit), we can ask what form the instability takes. because the branes have spatial
extent, perhaps the most natural assumption is that the solutions which spin too
fast are unstable against distributing their angular momentum unevenly across their
worldvolume, somewhat analogous to the gregory-laamme transition [2]. we will
have more to say on this possibility in section iii.

the work of [1] illustrates that the thermodynamics of the d3-brane world-volume
theory, as read o from the bekenstein-hawking formula from the supergravity geom-
etry, is stable only on a restricted region of phase space. that is, (1) is guaranteed
to be satised only if the xi and the xi lie within the specied region. our rst goal,
which we pursue in section ii a, is to extend the stability analysis of [1] from one inde-
pendent angular momentum to three, and to the case of near-extreme m5-branes and
m2-branes with two and four angular momenta, respectively. (the maximum number
of independent angular momenta is the rank of the rotation group perpendicular to
the brane).

we will restrict ourselves to the near-extreme limit of spinning branes. for d3-
branes, the string theory account of the microstates of the brane in terms of strongly
coupled n = 4 super-yang-mills theory is thought to apply in this limit. the near-
extremal spinning geometries have a near-horizon limit which is asymptotic to ads5 
s5, so if we employ the philosophy of the ads/cft correspondence [35], we would
say that the supergravity thermodynamics translates directly into a characterization of
thermal states of the gauge theory. instability is more of a surprise in this context, since
statistical mechanical derivations of thermodynamics as a rule imply subadditivity of
the entropy. the diculty of treating the strongly coupled n = 4 gauge theory at
nite temperature prevents us from deriving or disproving the instability from rst
principles. in section ii c we do however extend the simplied eld theory treatment
introduced in [1] to the case of several angular momenta, and we show that the results

3

are qualitatively similar to the supergravity predictions.

in section ii b we discuss the supergravity predictions for critical exponents at the
boundary of stability. the maximal number of fractional critical exponents at a given
point on the boundary is the number of non-zero angular momenta. we show in
section ii c that similar critical exponents arise from the naive regulated eld theory
treatment for the d3-brane. our analysis is not detailed on this point.

in section iv we analyze the supergravity solutions wick-rotated to euclidean time.
we observe that the angular momentum amounts in eld theory to a twist imposed on
the r-charged elds in the eld theory: the eld theory partition function is altered
from tr eh to tr reh where r is an element of the r-symmetry group. it describes
the angle through which the brane spins during one period of the euclidean time. in the
limit discussed in [6] where angular momentum becomes large with energy held xed,
r  (1)f , so we wind up with almost supersymmetric boundary conditions. for m5-
branes compactied down to four dimensions, this leads to n = 4 super-yang-mills
theory with supersymmetry slightly broken by boundary conditions in the kaluza-
klein reduction. we review how the near-supersymmetry aects the proposals to use
spinning branes as holographic approaches to qcd, and we note a puzzle regarding
the energy scale of supersymmetry breaking and connement.

ii. thermodynamics of spinning branes

a. supergravity analysis

the supergravity solutions for spinning branes were constructed in [7].2 the metric
for the general spinning d3-brane and m5-brane can also be found in [9,10] and [11],
respectively. we are interested primarily in the thermodynamics, and this follows
directly from the general formulas of [8].

some parameters that enter into the thermodynamics of d3-, m2-, and m5-branes

are shown in the following table:

2unfortunately, the spinning m-brane solutions quoted in [7] have a number of typographical
errors. however, these general spinning m- as well as d-branes can be obtained in a straight-
forward manner from [8]. there the general d-dimensional rotating two-charge black hole
solutions (of toroidally compactied string theory) were given. the corresponding spinning
(d3, m5, m2)-branes are obtained by turning o one of the two charges of the (d = 7, 6, 9-
dimensional) black hole, and then lifting the solution in a straightforward way to ten and
eleven dimensions, respectively.

the approximate expressions are for the near-extreme limit,    with r held
xed. scaling out the power n p v from e, ji, and s allows us to write all subsequent
expression in terms of e, ji, and s alone. that all powers of v can be absorbed in this
way is dictated by the absence of any scale in the theory; that all powers of n can also
be absorbed seems to be telling us that the eective number of degrees of freedom is
on the order n p, as rst conjectured in [12]. we can form dimensionless ratios

1. grand-canonical ensemble

now we wish to ask in what region of phase space s is a sub-additive function of the
energy density e and the angular momentum densities ji. we regard the ji as thermo-
dynamic variables rather than xed parameters, and the requirement of sub-additivity
means that legendre transforms with respect to the ji as well as with respect to e are
invertible. thus, in the sense described in section iii a of [13], we are investigating
stability in the grand canonical ensemble. stability in the canonical ensemble, where
only the legendre transform with respect to e is required to be invertible, amounts to
positivity of the specic heat, with the ji regarded as xed parameters. we will treat

6

stability in the canonical ensemble in section ii a 2. we will exhibit evidence in sec-
tion iii that the grand-canonical ensemble is the relevant one when the world-volume
is large. all of our actual calculations will be done in the microcanonical ensemble,
that is writing s = s(e, ji).

the function yh = yh(yi) is complicated to express in closed form, since it is the

solution of a cubic or a quartic equation, cf. (5). using (9), we can write

s = 2ep/(p+1)yh  

ji

ep/(p+1)! ,

(10)

where p+1 = cp22p+1/(d  1)p, and the arguments yi of yh have been written out
explicitly in terms of the ji. fortunately, there is a more convenient way to judge
the subadditivity of (10) than brute force. for instance, one can require that e is
concave up as a function of s and the ji. or, most usefully, one can show that the
domain of stability is the maximal region including the points where all ji = 0 where
the temperature t = e/s and the angular velocities i = e/ji are one-to-one
functions of s and the ji. this is the criterion we will actually use.

by dierentiating the explicit expression (10) with respect to ji, one can show that

it is useful to dene the dimensionless ratios

xi =

yi
yh

= 2

ji
s

.

(11)

(12)

because of the scaling which follows from conformal invariance, any dimensionless
thermodynamic quantity (like ep/sp+1) can be expressed in terms of the xi. this is
true in particular of i/t : we have

the sum over j in w is over all the independent angular momenta, of which there are
(d  1)/2. the most straightforward way to prove (13) is to use the relations

the rst of these is a rephrasing of (5); the second follows from the rst by logarith-
mic dierentiation; and the third follows from (12) also by logarithmic dierentiation.
again because of the various scaling laws, the relations t = e/s and i = e/ji
are one-to-one if and only if (13) can be inverted to express the xi in terms of the
yh /yi. at the boundary of a region of xi-space on which (13) can be inverted, at

can show that w is nite on the entire region of stability, its boundary will be given

least one of the eigenvalues of the matrix h 
by the solution of deth 
factor of w (d1)/2qk

yj i goes to zero or innity. provided we

this determinant has a simple closed form:

d(xi) =

(d  3)p (1) + 2p (1)
(d  3)p (1)  2p (1)

where p () is dened by

p () = yk

k) = 1 +

x=1



 xi1>i2>...>i

yj=1

x2
ij .

note that d(xi) = 1 when all the xi vanish. thus the region of stability is the domain
including xi = 0 where d(xi)  0. if all but one angular momentum is zero, then

d(x) =

(d  3)  (d  5)x2
(d  3) + (d  5)x2

(18)

which indicates that the region of stability for a single angular momentum is x2  d3
d5.
apparently by coincidence, p = d3
d5 as well. the bound x2  p is in agreement with
equation (17) of [1] in the case p = 3, and with the bounds derived in [14] for p = 2
and p = 5.

it is straightforward to verify that the denominators of w in (13) and d(xi) in (15)
dier only by a factor p (1), and that both these denominators are nonzero and nite
throughout the domain including xi = 0 where the numerator of d(xi) is positive.
thus an equivalent condition of stability to d(xi)  0 is

(d  3)p (1) + 2p (1) = (d  3) +

our methods can also be used to judge the stability of rotating black strings in ve
and six dimensions arising from intersections of spinning m-branes: m5  m5  m5
for ve dimensions, and m5  m2 for six dimensions. because the world-volume is
eectively two-dimensional, one does not expect any phase transition at nite temper-
ature, on account of the mermin-wagner theorem [15]. indeed, it is straightforward
to verify by direct computation that the entropy function is subadditive.
it is also
possible to trace through an analysis like the one in section ii a, introducing a combi-
nation of parameters rd3
cosh i sinh i for each constituent family of branes,
and verifying that (16) is always satised. (we note however that (19) is not always
satised for the six-dimensional case: a zero in the denominator of (16) cancels a zero
in the numerator.)

2. canonical ensemble

for the sake of completeness we also derive the subadditivity constraints for the
canonical ensemble. this is the case where the angular momenta (charges) of rotating
branes are kept xed, so that subadditivity of the entropy is exactly equivalent to
positivity of the specic heat at constant ji. as we will demonstrate, it may be dicult
to keep the ji uniform over the entire world-volume outside of the grand-canonical
region of stability. however, uniform ji will be our working assumption in this section.
it is a general result, demonstrated in section iii a of [13] and veriable directly from
comparing (22) to (20), that the region of stability in the canonical ensemble is larger
than in the grand canonical ensemble. the canonical stability constraints for spinning
branes with one angular momentum were rst studied by cai and soh in [14].

a special case a single angular momentum turned on, say, x1 = x 6= 0, these stability

constraints reduce to:

d3 : 2 + 5x2  x4  0 ,
m5 : 1 + 4x2  x4  0 ,
m2 : 1 + 2x2  0 .

(23)

which are identical to the constraints derived in [14]. note that the m2-brane with
a single angular momentum is always stable, but that with two angular momenta or
more an instability is possible. (for example, when one approaches criticality along
a special directions of n equal non-zero angular momenta the critical values become
xc  2.118431 and xc  2.193567 for n = 2 and n = 3, respectively.)

b. critical exponents

we will focus on the grand canonical ensemble. critical exponents characterize the
behavior near a critical point of the grand potential, also called the gibbs potential,
p e. using

and dened as  = e  st pi iji. conformal invariance implies  =  1

the expression (24) for  is in terms of the xi, and it is straightforward to make a
taylor expansion around a point xic on the boundary of stability. there is no singular
behavior in this expansion. however, if  is expanded around the chosen point xic
in powers of i  ci, there are in general fractional critical exponents, ci. this is
possible when in the expansion

i  ic = 2

where aij =

aij(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xk=xkc

(26)

the rst term on the right hand side vanishes. there will always be directions of
approach in xi-space where this term does vanish: aij has vanishing determinant at
the boundary of stability, and if we set xi = xic  vi where aijvj = 0, then

i  ic  c22 + c33 + . . .
  c  c22 + c33 + . . . ,

(27)

(28)

for some coecients ci and ci. there is no linear term in  in (27) by construction of vi.
there is also no linear term in (28) because such a term would cause some component
of the angular momentum to become innite as   0, and this we can rule out
with calculations in the microcanonical ensemble. eliminating  one can obtain an
expansion for  of the form

  (analytic) + |i  ic|2 + . . . ,

(29)

where the term shown explicitly is the leading non-analytic term. in the absence of
numerical coincidences such as the 2 term vanishing in (27), or the relative coecients
between 2 and 3 being identical in (27) and (28), we will have  = 1/2. it is important
to keep in mind that the exponent  is a function both of the particular point on the
boundary of stability one is approaching and of the direction of approach. in the cases
we have examined, generically  = 1/2 with some isolated exceptions which we will
now describe.

let us take set n angular momenta equal, so that x1 = . . . = xn = x, and send x
to its critical value xc with the other xi vanishing. in this case the expression for the

11

common value  of i  i
form:

t in terms of x can be inverted explicitly, and it takes the

x =

1

  [(cid:16) 2

+ (2n + 3  d)(d  3)]1/2(cid:19) ,

(30)

half integer powers appear in the expansion of x around  c when (2n + 3 d)(d
3) < 0, and this leads to  = 1/2. this situation obtains when n = 1 for all d, and
also for n = 2 in the case of the m2-brane. in fact n = 1 is essentially the generic
case: approach to the boundary along a normal direction away from any special point.
when n > 1 for the d3-brane or the m5-brane, and when n > 2 for the m2-brane,
(30) leads to an expansion of  which involves only integer powers of   c.

on account of (26), there can be as many independent directions where  is fractional
as there are independent vectors annihilated by aij. in order to determine when aij in
(26) has multiple zero eigenvalues, an ecient method is to determine the entire locus
of points where the polynomials in (20) vanish. let us call one of these polynomials
p(xi), and note that p = 1 . . . n up to a factor which is never 0, where i are the
eigenvalues of aij|xk=xkc. the locus p = 0 is the union of the vanishing sets of the
i. at a generic point on p = 0, only one i = 0. near a point of p = 0 where
the vanishing set of one eigenvalue crosses the vanishing set of another, the equation
p = 0 does not dene a manifold; rather, it denes two or more manifolds crossing.

i=1

p
xi

2 
we can nd these points by solving p = 0 and dp  p d1

dxi = 0 simultaneously.
for the m5-brane, there is no solution: f = 0 truly denes a manifold, and the two
eigenvalues of aij never simultaneously vanish. for the d3-brane and the m2-brane,
the only solutions are where all x2
i = 1. for the d3-brane, this is a branch point where
two sheets of p = 0 cross, and correspondingly two eigenvalues of aij vanish. for the
m2-brane, three sheets of f = 0 cross, so three eigenvalues of aij vanish. in general,
the number of eigenvalues vanishing at a branch point is indicated by the lowest degree
term in the taylor expansion of p around the branch point: that is, the order of the
branch point.

c. field theory analysis

in [1] a eld theory analysis of spinning d3-branes was attempted, using the fact
that transverse angular momentum on the brane amounted to r-charge. in this section
we will extend the analysis from one angular momentum to three. we will also briey
consider the m2-brane and the m5-brane.

the on-shell degrees of freedom in a single d3-branes world-volume theory are
two vector boson states (counting positive and negative helicity separately), six scalar
states, and eight fermion states. the r-charges of these states are specied by vectors

12

in the weight lattice of so(6). the on-shell degrees of freedom for a single m2-brane
are eight scalar states and eight fermion states, with r-charges specied by weight
vectors of so(8). the on-shell degrees of freedom for a single m5-brane are three
self-dual two-form states, ve scalar states, and eight fermion states, with r-charges
specied by weight vectors of so(5). all these states are tabulated in equation (31):

for p = 2, 3, or 5, let ~ be a vector which runs over the sixteen p-brane weights
given above, and set s~ = 1 when the corresponding particle is a boson and s~ = 1
when it is a fermion. we will calculate in the grand canonical ensemble with volt-
ages 1, 2, . . . , (d1)/2 corresponding to the elements of the cartan subalge-
bra of the r-symmetry group (for instance, in the case of d3-branes, we have 1,
2, and 3 for the three elements of the cartan subalgebra of so(6)). denoting
~ = (1, 2, . . . , (d1)/2) where i = i/t , we have in analogy to (26) of [1] an

there are charged massless bosons. the integrals in (32) are all special cases of

real  axis of lip+1(e). in [1] it was proposed to dene the integrals using the principle

real parts. this prescription together with the identity

(37)

for n coincident d3-branes branes in the supergravity limit, the world-volume theory
is strongly interacting. we nevertheless suggest (35) as a rst approximation to the
grand potential of 3 + 1-dimensional n = 4 su(n) gauge theory at high temperature,
where now we have scaled a factor of n 2 out of  as in section ii a. the specula-
tion is that even though the fundamental excitations are strongly interacting, for the
purposes of thermodynamics we can think of o(n 2) quasi-particle excitations which
have the same multiplet structure as the fundamental degrees of freedom. for the m2-
brane, agreement with supergravity requires o(n 3/2) quasi-particles, whereas for the
m5-brane, o(n 3) are required. these peculiar scalings are borne out by absorption
calculations [16], but are otherwise poorly understood.

for the rest of this section we will focus on the d3-brane.
thermodynamic stability requires that  be a subadditive function of t and the i.
because of the scaling laws due to conformal invariance, this amounts to being able
to express the i as single-valued functions of the ratios ji/s. it is straightforward to
check that this is possible on the region of  space containing the origin where

in (38), which generalizes (42) of [1], the index i is summed over in the last two terms,
and k and  are the indices of the 3  3 matrix whose determinant is taken.

the mean eld theory analysis of [1] also generalizes in a simple way. we will omit
some details which do not depend on the number of angular momenta. the basic idea
is that there is some self-eld contribution to the voltage, which we express as

 =  + f (j/t 3) .

(39)

here  is the total voltage,  is the applied voltage, and f (j/t 3) is the self-eld contri-
bution, given in terms of an unknown function f , and in terms of an r-charge density j
obtained by integrating over the thermal occupation factors (using the principle value
prescription) in the presence of the total voltage . for notational simplicity we have
dropped the arrows from , , and j, but they are indeed three-dimensional vectors,
and derivatives with respect to them are also three-dimensional vectors. thus the per-
meability  = / is a 3 3 matrix which can depend on . the simplest extension
of [1] is to assume f (x) = x, which implies that the permeability at zero voltage is
 = 2
3 1. that is, the d3-brane responds diamagnetically to an applied voltage. we
will show how this ansatz reproduces the critical behavior found in supergravity.

mean eld theory leads to a parametric expression for the free energy:




t 4  g() = g()
 =  +

.

g


(40)

the rst line in (40) uses (32) with  replaced by . the second line is a rephrasing of
(39) using the ansatz f (x) = x. the function g() is the same as appeared in (35).
since g() is analytic, the only way nonanalyticity can arise is through inverting the
relation between  and . nonanalyticity can arise in this context only if the inverse
permeability,

1 =

acquires a zero eigenvalue. thus the boundary of stability is determined by det 1 = 0,

this complicated expression reduces to |1|  2 when 2 = 3 = 0. it exhibits the
same qualitative behavior as (20), in that the boundary of stability is a generically
a single zero of the left hand side, with the sole exception of all 2
i equal, when the
boundary of stability becomes a double zero. as before, this indicates that generically
only one eigenvalue crosses through 0 at the boundary, but for all angular momenta
equal two eigenvalues vanish at the same time. we obtain the same critical behavior
from the mean eld theory analysis as from the supergravity, and for basically the same
reasons: making the expansions

  c = (1 + g(c))(  c) + 1

t 4 = g(c) + g(c)(  c) + 1

we see that  = 1/2 for variations of  in the directions in which 1 has a zero
eigenvalue, while  = 0 in the other directions. the algebra is the same as in (27)
and (28), except that there  represented a deviation parametrized in terms of x  xc,
whereas in (43) it would be a deviation parametrized in terms of   c.

iii. phase mixing

so far our goal has been to demonstrate that spinning branes with a suciently high
angular momentum become thermodynamically unstable. we have not answered the
obvious question: what form does the instability take? in this section we will entertain
two possibilities: 1) the branes fragment and y apart in the transverse dimensions; and
2) the angular momentum density localizes on the branes. for the sake of specicity,
we will focus exclusively on n coincident d3-branes with only one angular momentum.
in the notation of [1],

puts us outside the region of stability as calculated in the grand canonical ensemble.

the naive expectation is that d3-branes with  > 1/3 vigorously shed their angular
momentum by radiating either closed strings or individual d3-branes. in an examina-
tion of the radial potentials for closed string emission and for equatorial motion of a
test d3-brane in the background of n spinning d3-branes, we found no evidence for
a special unstable mode developing at  = 1/3. this is not necessarily a problem: as
commented upon in the introduction, the nature of the instability is not so much that
there is some runaway mode of the system by itself, but rather that it is impossible to
establish equilibrium between it and a heat bath.

16

the following simple estimate suggests that for  > 1/8 d-brane fragmentation is
thermodynamically allowed.3 suppose the the n d3-branes split into k equal frag-
ments. as the fragments y apart, they can acquire orbital angular momentum. as
an idealization of this complicated dynamical ssion process, let us suppose that most
of the angular momentum winds up in the orbital motion of the fragments, and that
most of the energy winds up in their non-extremality.4 as a further idealization, we
will assume that the process occurs uniformly across the d3-brane world-volume. by
compactifying the world-volume on a small t 3 one could ensure such uniformity. from
[1] we take the formula

s(e, j; n) =

25/433/4ne3/4
q1 +  + 

(45)

for the entropy per unit world-volume in terms of the energy and angular momentum
per unit world-volume. since we will be considering dierent values of n, we have
reverted to the conventions of [1]: e = e/v , j = j/v , and s = s/v , without the
factors of n 2 in the denominator which we used in section ii a. the ratio of the
entropy of the nal state (k identical non-spinning fragments) to the initial state (a
single cluster with spin) is

sf
si

=

ks(cid:16) e

k(cid:17)
k , 0; n
s(e, j; n)

= vuut

1 +  + 

k

.

(46)

the process is entropically favored if sf > si, which is equivalent to k  1 + +.

kinematics forbids the k = 1 process, so we get the lowest critical  from k = 2 (two
fragments):  > 1/8, as advertised. with k = 3 (three fragments) we get  > 1/3,
which coincidentally corresponds exactly to the boundary of the domain where s(e, j)
is subadditive. making the fragments unequal only increases the bound. for very large
, large values of k will be accessible, and we interpret the fragmentation as a jeans
instability of the disk of d3-branes described in [9].

the above estimate does not convince us that brane fragmentation is the dominant
instability for  slightly larger than 1/3. we would be more optimistic if an instability
of the horizon could be identied.
in any case, brane fragmentation would violate

3we thank f. larsen, e. martinec, and p. kraus for a stimulating discussion in which this
calculation was suggested to us.

4if we accounted for the energy that goes into hawking radiation and the motion of the
fragments, the bound would be  > 0 for some 0 > 1/8.

17

singularity theorems, so we may expect it to have a very long time-scale in the classical
limit of many coincident branes.

we now turn to the second possibility: that for  > 1/3 the angular momentum
density j tends to localize on the world-volume. if they are thermodynamically per-
mitted, inhomogeneities in j might nucleate locally on a shorter time-scale than brane
fragmentation. in fact, the time scale should be on the order of the inverse temperature
since there is no other scale in the problem.

let us regard (45) as an approximate expression for the entropy density in terms
of energy density e and angular momentum density j which are allowed to vary over
the world-volume. diusion and interactions will tend to keep the temperature t and
the voltage  (properly the angular velocity at the black hole horizon) spatially
constant. however, for a given (t, ), there are two possible values for energy density
and angular momentum density. (that there are two and only two possible values can
be seen from the fact that the equation of state, (20) of [1], is double-valued). one of
them, call it (e, j), will lie in the stable region where s is subadditive; the other, call
it (e, j), will lie in the unstable region. thus we are led to consider mixed states of
the two phases (e, j) and (e, j). we will argue that such states are entropically favored
over states with uniform (e, j) for  > 0.325, although only for  > 1/3 can a uniform

state evolve smoothly into such a mixed state. the mixed states are only saddle points
of the entropy functions, not maxima, because they involve an unstable component.

we emphasize that the following calculation is not on the same footing as the usual
analysis of phase coexistence, because one phase in the current context is unstable.
rather, it is intended as a preliminary probe of how inhomogeneous e and j may arise
near  = 1/3, based on the idea that t and  should remain at least approximately
uniform while these inhomogeneities are rst forming. because we are relying on the
known supergravity solutions as our guide to the thermodynamics, we are not equipped
to address the questions of coherence length, surface tension, and stability of phase
boundaries. ideally, one would like to establish the existence of a second stable phase,
perhaps one where the branes are separated in the transverse dimensions. then a more
standard equilibrium analysis would become possible.

assume that a fraction  of the spatial volume is lled by the unstable phase (e, j),
and the remaining fraction 1   is lled by the stable phase, (e, j). then the average
energy density, angular momentum density, and entropy density are

eav = e + (1  )e
jav = j + (1  )j
sav = s(e, j; n) + (1  )s(e, j; n) ,

18

(47)

where s(e, j; n) is the function (45). with eav and jav xed we want to extremize
sav by varying . that is, in an isolated system where the total energy and angular
momentum are xed, we extremize the total entropy by distributing energy and angular
momentum optimally between the two phases. this problem is mathematically well-
posed because e and j can be determined as functions of e and j, and then the rst
two lines of (47) amount to two (non-linear) constraints on three variables, leaving 
as the only free variable.

using (47), (49), and (50), one can obtain av and av explicitly as functions of  and
. the domain of  is [0, 1/3] because it is by assumption the ratio pertaining to the
stable component, and the domain of  is [0, 1]. we have veried numerically5 that the

5plots and numerics were obtained using mathematica.

the entropy along a given contour is extremized when

in gure 1 we show contours of constant av cut by a dashed line indicating the solution
set of (53).

from gure 1 one can conclude that for av > 1/3 the entropically preferred state,
among states with uniform temperature and voltage, is a mix of the stable and unstable

phases, with  > 0.46 and   1 as av  . the av < 0.322 mixtures are always
entropically disfavored: for such av the preferred state has  = 0. there is a narrow
band of values, 0.322 < av < 1/3, where there are two far-separated competing states
(see gure 2): one has  = 0 and one has   0.46. at av  0.325 there is a
transition where  jumps from 0 to 0.46. the temperature and voltage also jump at
this transition.

we regard this as preliminary evidence that there is a rst order phase transition at a
value of av strictly less than 1/3. the critical behavior associated with the boundary
of stability would be cut o nitely below the critical angular momentum by phase
separation. a more denitive treatment would be possible if one could identify a ther-
modynamically stable phase into which the system falls when the angular momentum
density is suciently high. our treatment has assumed that this new stable phase is
very slow to form compared to the time-scale on which small inhomogeneities in j can
nucleate. this is reasonable if the new stable phase is some version of a multi-center
solution, because passing to such a phase would violate classical singularity theorems.
in [14] it was proposed that in the canonical ensemble, stability persisted up to
  1.26. as a general rule we agree that thermodynamic stability of a system depends
on its environment. however the results of this section indicate that the instability of
spinning d3-branes at  = 1/3 is not easily avoided by changing ensembles. consider
a state with total e and j arranged so that av is just slightly larger than 1/3. the
pure phase state would correspond to where one of the grey lines in gure 1 intersects
the top of the frame. at this point,  = av. this is the sort of state that the authors
of [14] regard as stable in the canonical ensemble (though not in the grand canonical
ensemble). however, the system may increase its entropy continuously by owing down
along one of the grey lines, until it reaches the dashed black line, where entropy is a
maximum at least among two-component mixed phase states of the prescribed av. in
other words, the putatively stable state represents only a saddle point of the entropy,

not even a local maximum. this is in contrast with states with 0.325 < av < 1/3,

where a system in a pure phase state can increase its entropy only by making a big
leap, all the way along one of the ne black lines from the bottom of the frame to the

leftmost intersection of the ne black line with the dashed black line. in a nutshell, the
pure phase states represented by the bottom of the frame in gure 1 are metastable
against separation into a two-component mixture, but the pure phase states represented
by the top of the frame are not even metastable. these statements are independent of
the environment because we are talking only about shifting energy around within the
world-volume of the d3-branes. the key point is that d3-branes have spatial extent,
so any little bit of it can be regarded as a system in thermal contact with a heat
bath consisting of the rest of the brane. that is what makes the grand canonical
ensemble relevant. with black holes the story is dierent: because there is no spatial
extent, it is doubtful that one can regard one part of the black hole as a heat bath for
another part. if the d3-brane world-volume were compactied on a scale smaller than
the thickness of a domain wall between phases, then the situation would be physically
indistinguishable from a black hole, and calculations in the canonical ensemble might
become relevant.

iv. euclidean spinning branes

a. spin and thermal boundary conditions

euclidean black brane solutions can be obtained from the minkowskian ones by
sending t  it and j  ij, where the j are the angular momentum parameters
that enter into the solutions of [8]. complexifying them is necessary in order to keep
the dtd parts of the metric real. the consequences for the thermodynamics can all be
reasoned out from the fact that the angular momentum becomes complex. in brief, one
can retain equations (3) through (14) with the replacements yj  iyj and xj  ixj,
but yh  yh with no factor of i. these replacements have a profound eect on the
physics: as we shall now argue, the phase space is |xj| < 1, and points on the boundary
correspond to supersymmetric periodicity conditions in the euclidean path integral.

the new version of the rst equation in (14) is

y3d

h,e = yj

(1  x2

j ) .

(54)

this relation becomes singular when any of the xi reaches 1 in absolute value, so the
phase space is indeed the cube |xi| < 1. the new version of (11) and (13) is

j
t

= 2i

yh
yj

= 2i

xj
1  x2

.

(55)

we now want to study the limits of (55) as we approach the boundary of the cube.
consider xing some number of the xj at values nitely far from the horizon and then

2

3  d pk

22

letting all the others approach the horizon at the same rate:
for these others, say
xj = sj(1  ) where sj = 1 and   0. for convenience dene sj = 0 for all the xj
whose values are xed in the interior. let the number of xjs which are approaching the
boundary be n. approaching a generic point on the boundary corresponds to n = 1;
n > 1 means one is approaching a point on an edge or a corner of the cube rather than
a face. it is simple to see from (55) that

j
t

(56)

for example, if we send x1  1 and hold all the other xi xed, then 1/t  2i and
all other j/t  0.

to understand what is happening in the world-volume theory, let us rst recall that
in the absence of rotation, the usual thermal partition function, z = tr eh, can be
computed by a euclidean path integral with period 1/t for euclidean time. boundary
conditions on fermions are anti-periodic. to add real angular momentumthe kind
that we have studied in all the previous sectionsone would introduce a chemical
potential ~ for particles with r-charge: acting on a state |~i whose r-charge is specied
by the vector ~ in the weight space of the r-symmetry group, the hamiltonian h would
be replaced by h~~ (cf. (32)). but in this section we are studying euclidean angular
momentum, which corresponds to pure imaginary ~. thus

e~~/t|~i = e ~h~/t|~i = r|~i ,

(57)

where ~h = (h1, h2, . . . , h(d1)/2) is a basis of generators for the cartan subalgebra.
r = e ~h~/t is an element of the compact r-symmetry group so(d  1) (or more
precisely its covering group) when ~ is pure imaginary. the net eect of turning on ~,
as we see from (57), is to insert r into the partition function: instead of z = tr eh,
now we have z = tr reh. in the euclidean path integral, r just species a twist in
so(d  1) which one performs on all the elds before identifying from te = 1/t to
te = 0. this twist modies the usual (thermal) boundary conditions according to the
r-charge of each eld.

if we set 1/t = 2i and all other j/t = 0, then r = (1)f , where f = 0 for
bosons and 1 for fermions. that is, we recover supersymmetric boundary conditions.
maximal poincare supersymmetry is recovered in this case because r =  for any
spinor  of so(d  1). this does not mean that conformal invariance is recovered. in
fact it is not: the near-horizon geometry is not anti-de sitter for euclidean spinning
branes, even in the large spin limit we are considering. we are led to conclude that
the geometry must be describing a physical state analogous to those considered in [9],

23

where higgs vevs break conformal invariance.6

for n > 1, we can judge whether any part of supersymmetry is restored by deter-
mining whether there are any spinors  of so(d  1) which satisfy r = , where
r is the element of the covering group of so(d  1) specied by j/t = 2i/n for
it is straightforward to verify in this way that a fraction (1/2)n1 of
1  j  n.
supersymmetry is preserved in all cases except n = 4 for the m2-brane, where 1/4 of
supersymmetry is preserved.

by studying killing spinor equations in the spinning brane supergravity geometries
one can conrm the presence of unbroken supersymmetry. this was essentially done
in [18] for the m2-brane. to be more precise, [18] includes an investigation of the
killing spinor equations for bps-saturated r-charged black holes of n = 8 d = 4
gauged supergravity. the results of [19,13] indicate that kaluza-klein reduction of
spinning m2-branes leads precisely to large r-charged black holes of the type studied
by the authors of [18]. they found that 25n supersymmetries are preserved by black
holes with n = 1, 2, or 3 charges, while adding a fourth charge does not break any
additional supersymmetry. this counting is in agreement with the previous paragraph:
for example n = 1 corresponds to 16 supersymmetries, which is the maximum when
conformal symmetry is broken by the physical state.

the weight vectors listed in (31) can be used to determine the allowed momenta ke
around the euclidean s1. these momenta determine tree-level masses in the dimen-
sionally reduced theory. for n < 4 there is bose-fermi degeneracy in all cases (m2,
d3, and m5). (see also gure 3.) the m2-brane with n = 4 exhibits no bose-fermi
degeneracy. this may be an indication that our description of the world-volume theory
of many m2-branes in terms of excitations with the same so(8) quantum numbers as
for a single m2-brane is too simplistic to capture even the rough outlines of the eld
theory.

in order to further shed light on the nature of supersymmetry restoration in eld
theory and to make comparison with the supergravity results, let us turn to the study
of the thermodynamic quantities.

we obtain j/t = (2i)/n exactly when xi = 1 (i = 1,   , n), but other thermo-
dynamic relations become singular in this limit. so we choose i = ()2i/[n(1  )]
(xi = (1  )) (i = 1, ..., n,   1), and for the sake of simplicity we set other js
to zero. this is still not the most general way one could imagine approaching the
boundary of phase space: for instance, one could set xi = (1 ri) with arbitrary but
xed ri. this does not lead to any more general scaling behavior than what we will

6related ideas have recently been explored in [17], although there are subtleties with the
wick rotation in comparing with the present work.

observe, but the coecients in equations (58) through (67) and (71) would change.

first we compute the grand potential for the eld theory obtained from (32) with
the supersymmetric particle content given in (31). the eld theory results in the   0
limit are as follows:

for a single m5-brane, or d3-brane this eld theory analysis is sound:
it amounts
simply to counting states in a free eld theory. (it is not even plagued by the divergences
that we used the principle value prescription to solve in section ii c: those divergences
were for i real, and are completely avoided by pure imaginary i.) for n > 1 our
understanding of the eld theory at nite temperature is limited. the naive approach is
to hope that it has some properties in common with o(n 3) copies [o(n 2) copies] of the
n = 1 theory in the m5- [d3-] brane. this approach is not well motivated physically,
but it does give the correct scalings with n and  as predicted by supergravity. the
eld theory on multiple m2-branes not very well understood. it is based on a particular
infrared limit of the d2-brane gauge theory where so(8) symmetry is thought to be
recovered (see for example [20,21]). for a single brane, a simple hodge dualization of
a vector eld into a scalar eld suces to show this, but for multiple branes there does
not seem to be a simple argument directly from eld theory.

the positive powers of  in (58)-(59) appear because of the bose-fermi degeneracy in
the spectrum of allowed ke. this is substantially the only indicator of supersymmetry
in this free eld theory computation.

let us now compare the eld theory results to those obtained in supergravity. there
the grand potential  is given by (24). in the   0 limit,  has the following scaling
behavior:

comparing the supergravity results (62) through (64) with those the eld theory
analysis ((58) through (60)) reveals that except for rational prefactors the supergravity
and eld theory results are in good qualitative agreement for both d3- and m5-brane, as
expected since a single d3- and m5-brane eld theory analysis is believed to be sound.
on the other hand there is a qualitative discrepancy between the two approaches for the
m2-brane case, again indicating that the eld theory of m2-brane is poorly understood.
most importantly, we see that the energy density e = p scales in all cases with
a positive power of . recall that e is the energy density over and above the energy
density of a bps-saturated brane conguration. by the same argument that zero
energy states in a supersymmetric theory are supersymmetric states, we conclude that
a state with e = 0 preserves at least some of the original supersymmetries of the brane.
we would like to conclude this subsection by commenting on the supergravity anal-
ysis of the spectrum of the theory. this will become relevant in our discussion in the
next subsection of models of connement based on spinning branes. let us concentrate
on a minimally coupled scalar , that is a scalar whose linearized equation of motion
is the laplace equation in the background of the euclidean spinning brane:

(gg) = 0.

with the ansatz  = eikx(r), where x is a world-volume direction, and (for the sake of
simplicity) (r) depends only on the radial coordinate r, one obtains a radial equation
of the following form:7

7in deriving the above equation the full metric of the spinning brane has to be used. we
used the metric of the general d-dimensional rotating two-charge black hole solutions given
in [8]. again, the corresponding spinning (d3, m5, m2)-branes are obtained by turning o
one of the two charges of the (d = 7, 6, 9-dimensional) black hole, and lifting the solution to
ten and eleven dimensions, respectively.

must recall the replacements xj  ixj and yj  iyj. when n equal euclidean angular

thus mgap  t for n = 1, mgap  t for n = 2, and mgap diverges for n > 2. for
n > 2 it is possible that there is actually no discrete spectrum in the   0 limit. this
point is under investigation.

the mass gap can also be quantied in terms of the ratios of the angular momentum
densities at the boundary, ji, (i = 1,   , n) and e. it is straightforward to obtain the

some of the observations we have made about the scaling of the mass gap and
about supersymmetry restoration also follow easily from the results of [22,6,10,11].
the connection that does not seem to have been made there is that the eld theory
itself recovers supersymmetry in the limit of small  because of the insertion of an
element of the r-symmetry group into the partition function.

b. models of connement

the usual route to qcd4 [23] is to compactify the m5-brane worldvolume on a
circle twice. the rst time, one uses supersymmetric boundary conditions on a circle
of circumference 2r1, and by the m-iia duality the result is a d4-brane which, like
the m5-brane, is near-extreme. the second compactication is applied to the euclidean
time coordinate of the d4-brane: it has period 1/t , and we impose thermal rather than
supersymmetric boundary conditions. this second compactication is the important
step. the ve-dimensional theory one is starting with on the d4-brane is the euclidean
version of the su(n) gauge theory with maximal supersymmetry which descends from
the ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. the resulting theory
in four dimensions will also have su(n) gauge elds, but no supersymmetry, and it
is the candidate for qcd4. tracing through the m-iia relationship determining the
string coupling in terms of the compactication radius r1, and then the relationships
between the string coupling, the d4-brane gauge coupling, and the four-dimensional
qcd4 coupling g2
y m = 2r1t . the relevant points for our analysis
are: 1) the compactication process is unchanged when there is angular momentum in
the directions orthogonal to the m5-brane; 2) the t hooft coupling  = g2
y m n needs
to be large for the supergravity to be valid.

y m , one nds g2

n = 1, d = 7and exact expressions for the eigenvalues q were obtained in [17]. some other
cases can be solved in terms of heun functions.

28

when there is no angular momentum, the fermions are anti-periodic in the euclidean
time used in the d4  qcd4 compactication, so in the four-dimensional lagrangian
they have masses t . it is usually assumed that at large t hooft coupling, the scalars
pick up comparable masses. from supergravity one learns that the mass gap is also of
order t . this is sensible from a eld theory point of view: in the renormalization group
ow of a gauge theory in which the t hooft coupling is large at energies comparable to
the masses of the matter elds, one expects connement at only lower energies. this
is to be contrasted with a gauge theory where the t hooft coupling is weak at energies
comparable to the masses of the lightest matter elds. there we have the standard

one-loop relation mgap  exp(cid:18) 82

y m(cid:19) mmatter, and b0 = 11

b0g2

when there is a large angular momentum, or, in the parlance of section iv a, small
, the story is rather dierent. the fermion masses are not all on the order of the
temperature: as indicated in gure 3, some of them are on the order of t .

follows from standard thermal boundary conditions. the second and third lines show what
happens when one approaches the boundary of the phase space (large angular momentum for

on the order t . in the close groupings of ticks in the second and third lines, the degeneracies

supersymmetry is restored in the limit   0. in the n = 1 case, for energies much
smaller than t , only the center grouping of modes is available, and the theory is four-
dimensional n = 4 super-yang-mills. in the n = 2 case, the center group of states lls
out the n = 2 super-yang-mills multiplet.

supergravity calculations which we summarized in the previous subsection indicate

that the scaling of the mass gap is mgap  t for n = 1 and mgap  t for n = 2.

near the end of this section we explain why this scaling is rather at odds with our
eld theory expectations. for now we will regard the scaling of mgap as a non-trivial
prediction of supergravity.

in view of the existence of matter elds comparable to or much lighter than the
scale of connement, it is no surprise that large angular momenta did not suce to
decouple the glueballs charged under the global symmetry group which rotates these
quarks among themselves [6]. the existence of such kaluza-klein cousins has been a
persistent feature of all supergravity models of qcd4, but it need not be regarded as an
artifact of the construction which must disappear in a full string theory treatment. in
any conning gauge theory (including real-world qcd) in which there are fundamental
matter elds with some avor symmetry and with masses comparable to or lighter than
the connement scale, one expects to have avored hadrons as well as avor-neutral
glueballs. it may not be reasonable to hope that a full string theory treatment of these
backgrounds will decouple all matter elds and leave us with pure glue. it seems more
likely that it will leave us with conning glue coupled to light matter.

it makes sense that glueball mass ratios should be roughly the same [11] when one
makes one angular momentum large as when one makes two large in any ratio except
unity. in terms of the xi variables discussed in the section iv a and dened in (12),
an m5-brane with one angular momentum large with the other zero corresponds to
x1  1 while x2 = 0, whereas two large angular momenta with xed ratio corresponds
to x1  1 with x2/x1 = . as long as  6= 1, one is approaching the edge rather than
the corner of the square which represents the phase space of the spinning brane, and
the pattern of tree-level masses shown in gure 3 obtains. glueball mass ratios should
be and are approximately independent of  because the matter elds whose tree-level
masses are small in comparison with the connement scale. when  = 1, the pattern
of tree-level masses is as shown in the n = 2 line of gure 3. we expect that glueball
mass ratios will change at this point because the relevant matter elds have changed
their tree-level masses.10

one diculty with the original proposal of [23] is that the scale of the fth dimension
is the same as the scale of connement. thus any process whose energy is high enough
to probe the gauge dynamics non-triviallyin the sense that colored states, not just

10the term glueball is somewhat of a misnomer since we are thinking of states which should
involve adjoint matter elds even if they are singlets under the global avor symmetry that
the matter elds carry. the term glueball is in use because of the expectation (unlikely in
our view) that the supergravity models discussed will correspond to pure qcd4.

30

an eective theory like soft pions, would be needed to analyze the processwould also
probe the fth dimension. one might therefore ask in what sense one has dened a
four-dimensional gauge theory at any scale. the spinning branes construction is better

in this regard because for n = 1 there is a large range of energies, t  e  t ,

where the theory is four-dimensional and unconned. the decoupling [6] of glueballs
with kaluza-klein momentum in the fth dimension is the tangible evidence that the
length of the fth dimension is much smaller than the inverse qcd scale.

other approaches to connement avoid a fth dimension altogether by using only
d3-branes, either in type 0 theory [24] or with a varying dilaton in type iib theory
[25] (see also [26]. these models have their own diculties: in the former the gravity
description breaks down in the ultraviolet, and there is a tachyon whose mass is on the
string scale; while in the latter one seems to need some excited string state to start the
dilaton owing, and asymptotic freedom cannot be achieved. both approaches involve
naked singularities in the bulk.

we summarize the taxonomy of holographic approaches to conning gauge theories
in gure 4. the basic features of connement are not expected to depend on the
existence of matter elds or on their masses, provided that the beta function remains
negative. all the gravity models have a string tension which is much larger than the
square of the mass gap. this leads to some behaviors very unlike real qcd [27], in
particular nearly at regge trajectories. in gure 4, we have indicated only the mass
gapthat is, the mass scale seen by closed string probes. in all cases except 3), the
qcd string tension would be located between this mass scale and the next highest
scale; in 3) the relation of the qcd string tension and the temperature can only be
determined given the relative sizes of  and the t hooft coupling g2

y m n.

since only one large angular momentum is needed to make the scalings we have dis-
cussed, it should be possible to construct variants of the spinning m5-brane approach
by putting the branes at some spacetime singularity. orbifold backgrounds would be
expected to lead to bifundamental quarks rather than adjoints. there might even be
chiral models analogous to those discussed in [28]. a model with bona-de light fun-
damental quarks could be dicult to construct, since the fundamental representation
is the charge carried by one end of a string ending on a d-brane, and not typically by
an open string with both its ends on the brane.

there is one outstanding diculty: why for n = 1 is the connement scale much

higher than the tree-level masses of the light matter elds (t  t )? the most
obvious resolution would be for at least some of the light masses to receive radiative
corrections on the order t from diagrams where heavy elds run around loops.

if this were to happen, then superconformal invariance would be broken at a scale
on the order of t , and connement would follow at an energy scale only slightly
lower. but the following simple estimate suggests that perturbative eects cannot
generate a suciently large radiative correction. scalar mass renormalizations at one

where we have used dimensional regularization and the minimal subtraction scheme.
m is the mass of the heavy elds running around the loop. typically, in a theory
with supersymmetry broken by mass splittings for the heavy elds on the order m,
we have m2  (m)f (m)  (m)m log m
 on account of the near-cancellation of
bosonic and fermionic contributions. with mass breakings such as the ones indicated
in gure 3, the cancellation is even better: m2  (m)n f (n )(m) where n is the
degree of supersymmetry restored when m = 0. in particular, m2  4t for n = 1,
where n = 4 supersymmetry is restored in the   0 limit.
although perturbation theory seems to have failed, we nd it plausible that the heavy
elds should play a role in setting the scale of supersymmetry breaking at t . this
scale is just the geometric mean of the tree-level masses of the light and heavy elds,
but its relevance to the dynamics may emerge in eld theory only through features
peculiar to strong coupling gauge interactions.

to summarize our discussion: in no sense should spinning m5-brane solutions with
a large angular momentum be regarded as the analog of improved lattice actions for
pure qcd4. the fermions tree level masses are not all far above the connement scale.
in fact, some of them are far smaller than this scale. we do not understand the eld
theory mechanism that sets the scale of supersymmetry breaking and connement at
o(t ) for the case of one large angular momentum. however, if we take this scaling
as a given, we do understand why glueball mass ratios should be universal for two large
unequal angular momenta and somewhat dierent when they are equal: it is because
the pattern of supersymmetry breaking is universal in the rst case, but dierent in
the second.
it would be delightful if the near-restoration of supersymmetry could
be exploited to make more denite predictions about the conning dynamics than is
possible for pure qcd4.

the d3-brane with periodic euclidean time has been proposed as a model for pure
qcd3 [23]. without angular momentum, the bare three-dimensional fermion masses
and also the mass gap are on the order of t . with n equal large euclidean angular
momentum, the light fermion masses are mbare  t , whereas the mass gap is mgap 
1 n
2 t for n = 1 or 2. again it is not easy to see what in eld theory sets this
connement scale. universality of glueball mass ratios can be understood in a similar
way to the four-dimensional case, but we regard it as a more pressing problem to
understand the overall scaling of the mass gap from a eld theory perspective.

the supergravity analysis of the previous subsection applies to euclidean spinning
m2-branes as well. however, in view of the poor understanding of the large n eld

33

theory we refrain from drawing any further comparisons.

v. conclusion

the purpose of this paper was to provide a comprehensive study of the thermo-
dynamics of spinning d3-, m5-, and m2-branes. our results address the following
aspects:

 thermodynamic stability and critical behavior

we derived general stability constraints for near-extreme d3-, m5- and m2-
branes, all with the maximum number of independent spins. the region where the
entropy is subadditive as a function of both the energy and the angular momenta
is strictly smaller than the region where the specic heat is positive. to illustrate
one of the possible instabilities that develops when the entropy is not subaddi-
tive, we studied states where the angular momentum is unevenly distributed over
the world volume, and found them to be entropically preferred over the uniform
distribution despite the fact that they are not themselves stable congurations.

 field theory

we generalized the eld theory model of [1] to the case of multiple r-charges;
the dynamics is proposed to be described eectively by a collection of weakly
interacting massless quasi-particles whose r-charges and spins are those of the
abelian theory on a single brane. if one assumes in a addition that there is a
nonzero permeability for applied voltages dual to the various r-charges, then
this model reproduces the critical behavior of the supergravity analysis.

 euclidean spinning branes

euclidean branes with at least one angular momentum density which is large
compared to the energy density restore some fraction of supersymmetry. we
showed how this supersymmetry restoration arises in the eld theory: an element
of the r-symmetry group is inserted in the partition function, which for one large
spin approaches (1)f . the spectrum is nearly supersymmetric, with the bose-
fermi degeneracy broken by m  t , where  is a dimensionless parameter
that goes to zero in the limit of large angular momentum. the supergravity
analysis reveals that if there is connement, it occurs on a scale mgap  t 1n/2
when n equal euclidean angular momenta are made large. we have explained
how this picture elucidates some of the results of previous papers [6,11]. we have
left open the problem of identifying the eld theory mechanism that sets the scale
of supersymmetry breaking.
