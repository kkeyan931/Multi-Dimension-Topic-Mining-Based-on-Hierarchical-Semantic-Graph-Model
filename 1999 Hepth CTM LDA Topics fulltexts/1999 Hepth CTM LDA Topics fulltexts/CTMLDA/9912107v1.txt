abstract

we compute the mass and multiplet spectrum of m theory compactied on
the product of ads4 spacetime by the stiefel manifold v(5,2) = so(5)/so(3), and
we use this information to deduce via the ads/cft map the primary operator
content of the boundary n = 2 conformal eld theory. we make an attempt for a
candidate supersymmetric gauge theory that, at strong coupling, should be related
to parallel m 2branes on the singular point of the noncompact calabiyau four

1 introduction

duality between large n eld theories on d3branes placed at conical singularities and
type iib theory compactications on a 5d manifold have been the subject of many in-
vestigations in the last couple of years [1]-[3] (for a rewiew see [4]). in particular, in [5]
an n = 1 superconformal yangmills eld theory has been constructed which turned out
to be dual to type iib theory compactied on the t 11 = su(2)2/u(1) manifold. solid
evidence on such duality was developed in [6, 7, 8] and in [9], where a onetoone corre-
spondence was established between the kaluzaklein (kk) supergravity spectrum on t 11
[10] and the boundary superconformal operators. in the case of m2 and m5 branes the
ads/cf t conjecture was rst studied for maximal supersymmetry in compactications
on spheres s7 and s4 [11, 12, 13] and then further extended to lower n for sphere-orbifolds
and other brane systems [14, 15].

in [16] the question was raised whether one could similarly construct a superconformal
field theory (scft) in three dimensions which is dual for large brane-ux n to m
theory compactied on ads4  m7 [16, 17, 18], where m7 is one among the compact
einstein manifolds that were classied [19] and analysed in the eighties [20, 21]. such
threedimensional scfts would then be dened as the conformal limit of the world
volume theory of n m2branes positioned at a conical singularity of m3  y8, where y8
is the cone over m7.

three-dimensional scfts are more dicult to analyze because they emerge in non-
perturbative limit of conventional gauge quantum eld theories. the origin of this di-
culty is well known, and can be traced back to the fact that the three dimensional bare
gauge coupling constant is dimensionful, so that a conformal description of the theory
dual to supergravity is only possible in the infrared limit, where the gauge coupling blows
up and the gauge elds are integrated out.

in this regime, the scft is described as the low energy theory of n coincident m2
branes, where n is the number of units of ux of the dual of the elevendimensional four
form on the internal manifold m7.
indeed, compactications of mtheory on a circle
leads to a d2brane description in type iia theory whose worldvolume gauge theory
is not conformal and whose near horizon geometry generically is not ads [15, 22, 4].
the superconformal description is recovered in the strong coupling limit of type iia
decompactication, when g2
ef f = gsn/u [4] and u is the
energy scale. when the radius of the circle goes to innity, the gauge coupling also blows
up and we reach the m2brane description in the infrared of the threedimensional gauge
theory. its relevant degrees of freedom are given in terms of the d=3 chiral multiplets
and are related to the kk excitations of d = 11 supergravity. viceversa, if g2
ef f  0
and u  , we are describing the ultraviolet limit of the d=3 yangmills theory (for a
thorough discussion of the above considerations see [15, 22, 4]).

ef f >> n 1/2, u << g2

it is also important to observe that, although the d = 3 ultraviolet gauge theory has

1

both a coulomb and a higgs branch, in the ads4/cf t3 correspondence one is mainly
interested in the higgs branch, parametrized by the vevs of the scalars of the chiral
multiplets. the coulomb branch scalars, belonging to the vector multiplets, are excluded
since their vevs can be safely put to zero.

in [23] by a thorough study of the kk excitations and osp(4|2) multiplets [24] on the
m 111 = su(3)  su(2)  u(1)/su(2)  u(1)  u(1) [25] and q111 = su(2)3/u(1)2 [26]
manifolds, the relevant n = 2 scfts have been constructed on the basis of the mass
spectrum, and conjectured to be dual to m-theory compactications.

in the above construction, it was important that both m 111 and q111 admit a descrip-
tion in terms of toric geometry [27]. this allowed to identify the fundamental degrees
of freedom of the underlying scft and thus to nd the abelian gauge theories, whose
moduli space of vacua (the higgs branch component) is isomorphic to the conifolds over
the two sevenmanifolds.

this paper analyses the case of mtheory compactied on the real stiefel manifold
v(5,2)  so(5)/so(3) with so(3) canonically embedded in so(5). the relevant four-fold
cone whose base is v(5,2) was identied in [5].

the stiefel manifold is peculiar among the einstein spaces leading to n = 2 super-
symmetry in that it does not admit a toric description [27]. nevertheless, we shall see
that it is possible to build up the single brane (n = 1) theory and to conjecture its n > 1
extension by performing the following steps.

we rst analyse the full kk mass spectrum and osp(2|4) supermultiplets for the v(5,2)
manifold: this is in complete analogy with the procedure in [9] for t 11 and in [23, 25]
for some m-theory examples. a relevant point of our analysis with respect to [23] is the
absence of betti multiplets since there are no nontrivial betti numbers on v(5,2)

bp = 0,

p = 1, . . . , 6,

b0 = b7 = 1.

(1.1)

thus, there is no continuous baryonic symmetry [28, 29, 18, 9, 10] in the corresponding
scft.

the second step is to construct admissible superconformal boundary operators to be
put in dual correspondence with those kk supermultiplets undergoing shortening when
the required unitarity bounds on the osp(4|2) representations are saturated. to arrive
to a well founded conjecture for the scft operators, we are guided by the consideration
of the classical equation describing the eight dimensional cone y8 over v(5,2). it turns out
that the solution of the cone equation [5]

z2
a = 0

(1.2)

xa=1

can be obtained in the simplest way by use of the so called plucker embedding, where
beside the pfaan identity on the coordinates pij = pji (where i, j are indices in the
fundamental representation of sp(4)  so(5))

ijklpijpkl = 0

2

(1.3)

one also uses the traceless constraint

c ijpij = 0.

as shown in [23], the solution to (1.3) can be given as

pij = a[ibj].

(1.4)

(1.5)

in the present case, we nd that one can write the coordinates parametrizing the cone y8
as the bilinear

za = ai a

ijbj,

(1.6)

where ai, bi are in the 4 of sp(4)  so(5) and a
ij are the gamma matrices in ve
dimensions. the vanishing of a su(2) dterm xes the residual sl(2, c) invariance
of equations (1.3) and (1.4). the above solution (1.6) is obtained by a procedure quite
analogous to that employed in [5] to solve the cone equation on t 11 in terms of two objects
ai, bi belonging to the representation (1/2, 0)  (0, 1/2) of su(2)  su(2). there, the
analogous of sl(2, c) invariance was given by equation (13) of [5], namely invariance
under complex rescalings.

this discussion gives us a little but useful information on the gauge group g of the
theory in the ultraviolet regime. more precisely, since the equation for the vanishing of the
dterms is su(2) valued, the gauge group should reduce to su(2) for a single m2brane
at the conical singularity. then, in virtue of the fact that the conifold coordinate za does
indeed appear in the kk spectrum and is a gauge singlet, we arrive at the conclusion that
for n > 1 the basic singleton s
i , transforming in the 4 of so(5), must be in a pseudoreal
representation of g labeled by the index . albeit this requirements could be satised by
several groups, we are led to conjecture the simple choice g = usp(2n)  o(2n  1),
where the index  of s

i belongs to the bifundamental representation4 of g.

once we have some solid base for the choice of the basic degrees of freedom in the
dual threedimensional n = 2 scft, we can perform the last step and show that it is
possible to construct a complete set of conformal primary operators matching all the kk
multiplets previously obtained.

in establishing such correspondence we follow the procedure already employed in [9]
for the t 11 case. in particular we nd that, as for t 11, there are long multiplets with
rational protected dimensions5.

it is interesting to note that since in the infrared limit the gauge eld is integrated
out, one may expect that it should be related in the scft to some composite eld in
terms of the singleton s
i . in fact we nd in the gravitino sector a composite eld x
obeying dx = 0 whose  component6 has the right quantum numbers of a gauge eld,
being a singlet of the avour group so(5) and having rsymmetry y = 0.

4indeed such gauge group appear in the context of orientifold models [30].
5 the same feature was also found in [23].

in the rest of the paper, section 2 briey deals with the harmonic analysis on the stiefel
manifold while section 3 contains the results on the full mass spectrum and its assembling
into osp(4|2) supermultiplets, with particular emphasis on the shortening patterns due
to saturation of unitarity bounds.

section 4, relying on the solution of the conifold equation, proposes a candidate for
the classical n = 1 theory which is supported by the condition of vanishing dterms. the
n > 1 extension is then conjectured to be related in the ultraviolet to a gauge theory of
d2-branes given by the product of two nonsimply laced groups g = usp(2n)o(2n1)
with chiral multiplet s
i transforming in the spinor representation of the avour group
so(5) and in the bifundamental of g.

some considerations are also given on the possible existence of a superpotential, at
least in the n = 1 case. in section 5, after a short summary of the conformal operators
related to the shortenings of kk representations, we construct a set of conformal operators
which can be put in correspondence with the various supermultiplets. finally, we give a
summary of our result in section 5 while some of the more technical aspects regarding
useful tools for the harmonic analysis are contained in two appendices.

2 the mass spectrum of v(5,2)

harmonic analysis on the coset space v(5,2)  so(5)/so(3) yields the complete mass
spectrum, which as in the other n = 2 supersymmetric compactications, is arranged
into osp(4|2) representations. referring to [10] and references therein for the relevant
details concerning harmonic expansion on a generic coset manifold, we give below the
essential ingredients for carrying out the computations and collect our results in tables
for the various supermultiplets.

as in any kk compactication, after the linearization of the equations of motion of
the eld uctuations, one is left with a dierential equation on the elevendimensional
elds {j}

[1,2,3](x, y)

({j}

x + [1,2,3]

y

){j}

[1,2,3](x, y) = 0.

(2.1)

here the eld {j}
[1,2,3](x, y) depends on the coordinates x of ads4 and y of v(5,2), and
transforms irreducibly in the representations {j} of so(3, 2) and [1, 2, 3] of so(7). x
is the kinetic operator for a eld of quantum numbers {j}  {, s} in fourdimensional
ads space and
y is the laplacebeltrami operator for a eld of spin [1, 2, 3] in the
internal space v(5,2). (in the following we mostly omit the index {j} on the elds. the
symbol [1, 2, 3] denotes the quantum numbers of the so(7) representation in the young
tableaux formalism.)

more specically, one expands the d = 11 supergravity elds [1,2,3](x, y)={hab,
aabc,a} (a = (a, ), a = 1, . . . , 4,  = 1, . . . , 7) in the harmonics of v(5,2) transforming
irreducibly under the isometry group of v(5,2), and computes the action of
y on these

4

harmonics. the eigenvalues are simply related to the ads mass.

the two necessary ingredients in this computation are the geometric structure and the

harmonics of the coset space.

geometry

we give here a brief description of the essential geometrical elements of the stiefel manifold
such as the metric and the riemmanian curvature, that are used to build the invariant
laplacebeltrami operators.

we remind that the stiefel manifold, beside so(5), has an extra isometry so(2)r

that can be identifyed with the rsymmetry group [19]

g
h

= v(5,2) 

so(5)  so(2)r
so(3)  so(2)h

,

(2.2)

where the embedding of the so(2)h into so(5) so(2)r is diagonal and the embedding
of so(3) in so(5) is the canonical one, namely the fundamental of so(5) breaks under
so(3) as 5  3 + 1 + 1 (other embeddings yield dierent inequivalent m7 with n 6= 2).
we call ,  = 1, . . . 5 the so(5) indices, i = 1, 2, 3 the so(3) indices and a = 1, 2
the so(2) ones. the adjoint generators of so(5) and so(2)r  u(1)r are respectively
t , u.

the so(5) algebra is

[t, t] = t + t  t + t,

(2.3)

which means that our generators in the vector representation are (t ) = 2
.

1

for the canonical embedding of so(3) in so(5),  = (i, a), we can dene jk 
2kijtij as the so(3) generators and n  t45 + u as the so(2)h generator. the coset
generators are given by tia  (tm, t m) (m, m = 1, 2, 3), t7  t45  u.

since the vielbeins are cosetalgebra valued, we use the same convention for labelling

the vielbein directions in the coset space.

specic combinations of the structure constants.

the harmonics on the coset space v(5,2) are labelled by two kind of indices, the rst giving
the specic representation of the isometry group so(5) ur(1) and the other referring to
the representation of the subgroup h  so(3)  so(2). the harmonic is thus denoted
by y (m,n,q)
(y), where m,n are the quantum numbers of the so(5) representation, q is
the ur(1) charge and qh are the hquantum numbers.

(qh )

the above results imply that an so(7) eld [1,2,3](x, y) can be splitted into the
direct sum of h irreducible fragments labelled by qh . the analysis of the reduction of the
so(7) representation under the h group reported in appendix b, yields that the vector
and spinor so(7) representations break as

7  31  31  10,
8  31/2  31/2  13/2  13/2,

(2.10)

and by taking suitable combinations one can also derive all the other tensor decomposi-
tions.

the generic eld [1,2,3](x, y) can then be expanded as follows

ab...(x, y) = x() x(m)

()(m)(x)y ()(m)

(2.11)

where a, b, . . . are so(7) tensor (or spinor) indices of the representation [1, 2, 3], () is
a shorthand notation for (m, n, q) and m labels the representation space of (m, n, q).
of course, not all the harmonics are allowed in the (2.11) expansion, as the irrepses
of so(7) appearing in (2.11) must contain, once reduced with respect to h, at least one

7 note that there is an ambiguity in the sign of the rescalings, since the einstein space requirement on
the curvature determines only their square. however, this ambiguity is only apparent. while the partially
reected solutions with r(a)  r(a) or r(b)  r(b) are perfectly equivalent to our description, a change
in the sign of r(c) implies that we really reect the orientation on the manifold and as a consequence we
completely break supersymmetry.

of the representations appearing in the decomposition of [1, 2, 3] under h. this gives
some constraints on m, n, q which select the allowed representations ().

table 1: correspondence between 11d and 4d elds and harmonics [31]

one can now proceed with the kk analysis, implementing the above informations in all
the laplacebeltrami operators and computing the eigenvalues of the various harmonics
and thus the masses of the kk states.

although straightforward in principle, this analysis can become quite cumbersome for
some of the higher spin operators. luckily, it is not really necessary to complete the
whole task. in fact, due to the n = 2 supersymmetry, this peculiar compactication falls
in the class considered in [24], where the osp(4|2) multiplet structure was elucidated,
together with the mass values expected for states of given quantum numbers. most of
these multiplets can be lled by using only our results for the simpler operators, while
the entries in the remaining slots can be determined with the help of supersymmetry.

7

from the scalar, spinor and vector eigenvalues, we have obtained the masses for all
the graviton and gravitinos and for some of the vectors, spinors and scalars, which let
us ll the ve types of supermultiplets presented in tables 26, with all the shortening
patterns. a preliminary analysis of the rank of the twoform matrix yields that we can
have at most two more vector multiplets, which we guess do not undergo shortening.

indeed, as in the t 11 case [10, 9], all the mass eigenvalues depend on the gquantum
numbers only through the function h0, which is the scalar laplacian eigenvalue. for the
stiefel manifold, such eigenvalue is given by

h0(m, n, q) =

32

9 (cid:16)6m 2 + 9n + 3n 2 + 12m + 6mn  q2(cid:17) .

(2.12)

since for a given number of preserved supersymmetries, the structure of the linearized
equations, supersymmetry relations and supermultiplets are xed, we can suppose that
also the mass formulae in terms of h0 are universal for all seven-dimensional n = 2
supersymmetric compactications. by this we mean that not only the number and type
of multiplets for dierent compactications are the same, but also the h0 mass dependence
should be equal.

this is exactly what we nd by comparing our case with the m 111 compactication
[25], and we expect such agreement to hold also for the q111 space. of course, the
shortening patterns as well as the possible presence of betti multiplets will be model
dependent features, as they derive either from certain functions of h0 taking rational
values or from nontrivial betti numbers of the relevant manifold. however, in this
44 + h0 and  = 1
respect, the two vector multiplets mentioned before have  = 1

that all the relevant output derived from the supergravity analysis is correct.

3 the ads4  v(5,2) multiplet structure.

we report below in tables 26 the ve families of supermultiplets we have found: one
graviton multiplet, two gravitino multiplets and two vector multiplets.

each table has ve main columns. the rst column contains the spin quantum number
of the state, while in the second we give its (s) value. the basic value of  assigned
to each multiplet is the one belonging to a vector eld, a spin 1/2 or a scalar for the
graviton, gravitino and vector multiplets respectively. in the third column we write the
rsymmetry of the state where the value y is assigned to the state with (s) =  . we
use here y = 2
3q, since this varies in integer steps according with the usual convention
on the unit value of the rcharge of the  coordinate [24]. the fourth column shows
the specic eld of the kk spectrum that is associated with the given osp(4|2) state,
according to the notations of [24]. the fth column contains the mass of the state8 given
in terms of h0.

8 we give the value of the mass for the fermions and the mass squared for the bosons.

8

for generic so(5) quantum numbers and rsymmetry values, the multiplets of tables
26 are long multiplets of osp(4|2). however, group theory predicts [24] shortening in
correspondence with specic threshold values of the quantum numbers. these give rise
to chiral (), semilong () or massless () multiplets. the above symbols appear in the
extra left columns to denote the surviving states in the shortened multiplets. in absence
of these symbols no shortening of any kind can occur for that multiplet.

4 classical v(5,2) cone equation and cft

consider the noncompact fourfold dened by

z2
a = 0,

5

xa=1

(4.1)

which has an ordinary double point singularity at za = 0 [5]. this conifold is a cone
over the homogeneous space so(5)/so(3), that can be retrieved by looking at the set of
points at unit distance from the singularity

5

xa=1 |za|2 = 1.

(4.2)

the full isometry group of this space is so(5)  ur(1) where the ur(1) plays the role of
an rsymmetry group and acts as a phase shift on the coordinates

za  eiza.

(4.3)

therefore the za have q = 1 under this symmetry and transform in the 5 of so(5).

since it acts nontrivially on the canonical line bundle of the conifold, the (4.3) trans-
formation is an rsymmetry of the theory. we can also see that it is an rsymmetry
group from the fact that the holomorphic 4form

 =

dz1 dz2 dz3 dz4

z5

(4.4)

has q = 3 under the ur(1) (  e3i). the charge of the fermionic coordinates of
superspace is xed by the requirement that they transform as , and then q = 3
2.
indeed, on a calabiyau manifold we can always write the holomorphic form as

abcd = tabcd,

(4.5)

where  is a covariantly constant spinor. this means that  transforms as 2, and
supersymmetries, being generated by covariantly constant spinors, transform as .

as explained in sect. 3, it is convenient to x the rsymmetry value of the  co-
3q, under which

ordinates equal to one, and to introduce the rescaled rcharge y = 2
y = 1.

in complete analogy with [5], we can write a cy metric on the cone by introducing

the so(5) invariant kahler potential

k = xa

zaza!3/4

.

(4.6)

dening r  (pa zaza)3/8 and introducing a set of angular variables ya, invariant under

the scaling of the z coordinates, the metric can be put in the standard form

ds2

c = dr2 + r2gabdyadyb (a, b = 1, . . . , 7).

(4.9)

describe the supergravity vacuum yielding the spontaneous compactication on a seven
manifold from eleven to four spacetime dimensions.

this supergravity solution has no moduli, as in eleven dimensional supergravity there
is no dilaton and the vevs of the elds giving the ads4v(5,2) compactication is uniquely
xed. the only angle we could introduce is a shift in the vacuum value of the three
form aabc by a closed nonexact threeform on the internal indices. but we know that
h3(v(5,2), z) is at most discrete torsion [23] and therefore there are no angles. the
absence of moduli reects in the cft denition implying that the interacting xed point
is isolated in the parameter space.

this seems to be related to the geometrical nature of this manifold. it has been shown
[27] that, at variance with the m 111 and q111 cases, the stiefel manifold does not admit a
description in terms of toric geometry and thus it is very dicult to see if it can be found
as a partial resolution of some orbifold. if this could be done (like for the q111 manifold
[27]), it would imply that there exists a ux from the orbifold cft to this infrared point
[5, 18], but it does not seem to be the case. recent supergravity calculations [32] seem to
conrm this fact at least for uxes connecting manifolds with the same topology.

the conformal field theory

in the same spirit of [5], the basic degrees of freedom of the desired cft can be understood
upon solving the (4.1) equation. this can be done as follows: we set

za = ta ab  tai a

ijbj

(4.10)

where ai and bi are so(5) spinors (transforming in the fundamental representation of
sp(4)) and a are antisymmetric gamma matrices in ve dimensions, namely

a
ij = cik(a)k

j,

(4.11)

cik being the sp(4) invariant metric. since (using the identity a
cijckl)

ija kl = 6c[ijck]l +

zaza  (ta ab)(ta ab)  (ta cb)2,
we have to supplement (4.10) with the symplectic trace condition

5

xa=1

cijaibj = 0

12

(4.12)

(4.13)

in order to retrieve the conifold equation (4.1).

this matches exactly the representation of the conifold already used in [23] in terms

of the plucker coordinates

satisfying the pfaan constraint

pij = a[ibj],

c [ijc kl]pijpkl = 0,

(4.14)

(4.15)

supplemented with the traceless condition c ijpij = 0 9. equations (4.13) and (4.14) are
invariant under sl(2, c) transformations. if we set ai = si
2, we see that the
plucker coordinates

1 and bi = si

pij = a[ibj]  si

sj



,  = 1, 2

(4.16)

and their symplectic trace c ijpij = 0 are invariant under sl(2, c).

noting that sl(2, c) is the complexication of su(2) [34], we can gauge x such

invariance precisely by setting the su(2) dterm to vanish

dsu (2) = 0  


i=1 |ai|2 =p4
p4
p4

i=1 aibi = 0.

i=1 |bi|2,

(4.17)

the above discussion implies that the correct gauge group g to be used for n coincident
branes should reduce to su(2) for n = 1. hence, choosing g to reduce for n = 1 to
su(2), equation (4.17) xes the sl(2, c) residual invariance. this gauge xing is quite
analogous to the one used in [5], where the complexication of the u(1) residual symmetry
in the solution of the cone on t 11 is given by a complex rescaling of the relevant variables.
given the above information, we can try to guess g, when n > 1. the product of
two unitary group is excluded, since the coordinate, as in t 11 (but not on the spheres),
appears in the kk spectrum and it is a gauge singlet so that the spinor s
i must be in
a pseudoreal representation of g (in a pseudoreal representation c s = s, c 2 = 1 and
thus the gauge singlet is contained in the antisymmetric product (s  s)asy).

we are thus led as a minimal choice to the product of the two non-simply laced groups

g = usp(2n)  o(2n  1)

(4.18)

the rationale for this choice is that, if we take the singleton si to be in the bifundamental
representation of g, then, since si is in the 4 of sp(4), the coordinate

za = t r (stas)

(4.19)

is nonzero only if the gauge group contains a factor usp(2n); the other factor must then
be the orthogonal group o(2n  1). indeed, the orthogonal group, having a symmetric
9 curiously (4.15) is analogous to the moduli space of an su (2) n = 2 gauge theory with hypermul-

tiplets with two avours [33].

13

invariant metric, assures a nonzero value for za and moreover its order is xed to be
2n  1 because of the condition g<vac> = su(2).

such groups usually arise when one deals with orientifold projections [30] and for the

present case n refers correctly to the total number of branes before mirroring.

from the chain decomposition

usp(2n)  o(2n  1)  usp(2)  usp(2(n  1))  o(2(n  1))

 usp(2)  u(n  1)  u(n  1)
 usp(2)  u(n  1)diag  usp(2)  u(1)n 1

(4.20)

we can retrieve the phase where all but one brane are free to move at smooth points over
the cone. looking at the chain (4.20), we see that, by the rst decomposition, we get

si =

ai bi
0
0
...
...

(4.21)

where the upper left block is a 1  2 matrix, the lower right block has indices a,  =
1, . . . , 2n  2, while the odiagonal blocks are rectangular 1 (2n  2) and 2 (2n  2)
zero matrices.

since usp(2(n  1)) and o(2(n  1)) both contain a u(n  1) subgroup under
which they both decompose as (n  1)  (n  1), we have a  a, a and   , 
(a, a, ,  = 1, . . . , n  1). correspondingly, the lower right (2n  2) (2n  2) subblock
of si becomes

which derives from the second step of the chain (4.20). further going to the diagonal
u(n  1), we have si

a = 0 and setting si

a = bi we nd

a = ai, si

a = si

a =   si

(4.22)

(4.23)

when we consider a generic vacuum conguration udiag(n  1)  u(1)n 1, the ai,

bi subblocks reduce to diagonal (commuting) matrices in the cartan subalgebra.

we remark that it is likely that there exist just one singleton si and that ai and bi
are just specic components of these si. indeed, promoting ai and bi to two independent
singletons si, t i, would imply that equation (4.19) admits the baryonic symmetry

si  siei,
t i  t iei.

(4.24)

(4.25)

the baryonic symmetry is related to the existence of u(1) betti multiplets in the kk
spectrum [31, 10, 23], which only occur if there are non-trivial betti numbers bi, i 6= 1, 7.

14

however, v(5,2) has the same real homology the seven-sphere s7, and thus a continuous
baryonic symmetry is ruled out.

thus we propose that the cft describing a large number of m2branes on the (4.1)
singularity is given by the infrared xed point of an usp(2n)  o(2n  1) gauge theory
where the basic degrees of freedom are chiral multiplets si lying in the 4 of so(5), with r
symmetry charge q = 1/2 (or y = 1/3) and in the (2n , 2n1) irrep. of the gauge group.
in the brane construction of gauge theories usually there can be other matter elds in
symmetric and antisymmetric representations. we assume here that such representations
decouple at the conformal ir xed point.

the chiral elds (singletons) of the conformal eld theory have  = |y| = 1

3. this
means that owing to the interacting point they acquire an anomalous dimension  =  1
6.
this makes the conformal dimension violate the unitarity bound  
, but since the
singleton eld is not a gauge group singlet it is not an observable of the theory. the
analogous phenomenon occurs for the vedimensional case t 11, where a,b = 3
4 < 1
and for the proposed cfts dual to the sevendimensional manifolds m 111 and q111 [23].
as already remarked, the gauge theory exists only in the ultraviolet limit where it is
not conformal and where the gauge vector potential, which is a singlet of the matter group
so(5) is in the adjoint representation of usp(2n)  o(2n  1). we could dualize it, at
least in the coulomb branch, and then reintroduce it in the cft. however, from the kk
analysis, we see that we have no states corresponding to products of this true singleton
eld (with  = 1

1
2

2) and therefore we have no coordinates for the coulomb branch.

as we will see later, it is also essential to introduce a superpotential whose jacobian
ideal gives the needed vanishing relations for the correct matching of the chiral primaries
with the supergravity hypermultiplets. this is given generically by the sixth power of the
singleton elds

w(si) = cijklmn tr(sisjskslsmsn).

(4.26)

where the tensor cijklmn is constructed by an appropriate linear combination of products
of three sp(4) invariant metrics cij. it should probably be made of a combination of the
following structures

t r [(ss) (ss) (ss)]
t r [(ss) sas sas]

t rhsas sbcs sdesi abcdef

t rh(ss) sabs sabsi
t rhsabs sbcs sc
asi
t rhsas sbs sabsi .

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

(4.31)

(4.32)

let us consider the previous structures for n = 1, when we can drop the trace symbol.
we easily see that they are the six a priori existing singlets which can be obtained from

15

the product of six 4 spinor representations of sp(4). next we note that when (4.23) holds,
all the above structures are given by products of three ai and three bi contracted with
three cij tensors. actually, there is just one possible sp(4) invariant that can be built,
namely

(aibjcij)3

(4.33)

furthermore, the rst four structures (4.27)(4.30) are antisymmetric under the exchange
of ai and bi while the last two are symmetric. that means that, by fierz identities,
(4.27)(4.30) must be proportional to each other, while the other two must vanish iden-
tically.

5 ads/cft correspondence

osp(4|2) conformal superelds
a generic osp(4|2) representation [24] is labelled by three quantum numbers, according
to the osp(4|2)  so(2)  so(3)  ur(1) decomposition of the supergroup. they are
the energy , the spin s and the rcharge y.

this generic representation is unitary if

while short chiral representations can occur for

  1 + s + |y|,

 = |y| 

1
2

.

(5.1)

(5.2)

like in the su(2, 2|1) case [9], at the threshold of the unitarity bound (5.1), we can
obtain short representations. these bpssaturated states correspond to short superelds
which thus satisfy some dierential constraint.

operators with protected dimensions are related to such shortenings and they fall in

three categories:

 chiral superelds: they occur when  = |y| and satisfy the condition

d(x, , ) = 0,

(5.3)

or d(x, , ) = 0 for antichiral ones.

 conserved currents: they occur when  = 1 + s and satisfy

d1j1...2s(x, , ) = d1j1...2s(x, , ) = 0
for s = 0.

j(x, , ) = 0.

or d2j(x, , ) = d

2

if s 6= 0

(5.4)

(5.5)

16

 semiconserved currents: they occur when  = 1 + s + |y| and satisfy

1l1...2s(x, , ) = 0,

d
d2l(x, , ) = 0,

(s 6= 0)

(s = 0)

(5.6)

(5.7)

if leftsemiconserved, or the conjugate conditions if rightsemiconserved.

it is trivial to see that a right and left semiconserved supereld is also conserved.

the protected operators

from the cft point of view, we expect to have chiral operators corresponding to the
wavefunctions of the conifold [5]. such operators are given by

tr k  t r (za1 . . . zak ) ca1...ak

(5.8)

with ca1...ak a completely symmetric and traceless rank k tensor. they have  = y = 2

3k.
surely, there should be a conserved current related to the global so(5) symmetry,
which should be a singlet of the gauge and rsymmetry group and that we can identify
as

j ab  sabs

(5.9)

this j ab should be massless and satisfy d2j ab = d2j ab = 0. its conformal dimension is
therefore  = 1.

another operator with protected dimension we certainly expect is given by the stress

energy tensor

j = d sds + d sds + i s
which has  = 2, y = 0 and satises dj = dj = 0.


/ s,

(5.10)

it is now trivial to see that we should also expect kk supergravity states corresponding

to the following semiconserved superelds

tr (jk)

and

tr (j abk)

(5.11)

(or the conjugate ones).

it seems more problematic to nd the appropriate singleton combinations which ap-
pear as semiconserved spin 1/2 superelds in the cft corresponding to short gravitino
multiplets on the supergravity side. in the theory at hand there is no eld like the w
of the t 11 case [5, 9] and thus there is no natural candidate for these operators. we also
have to be careful not to use simple descendants of primary operators and this makes the
task more dicult. anyway, once we have the isometry group quantum numbers, from
the kk analysis, we can see that the appropriate combinations of the s
i are uniquely
xed, and will be written explicitely below.

the correspondence

17

given the structure of the osp(4|2) multiplets of elevendimensional supergravity com-
pactied on ads4v(5,2), we can make the comparison between these results and the cft
predictions. we can also make use of these results to explicitly determine the expression
of the fermionic operators related to the short gravitino multiplets.

along the lines of the vedimensional case of type iib supergravity on ads5  t 11
[9, 10], we look for rational conformal dimensions occurring in the kk multiplets and see
whether they correspond to the right shortenings needed to be related to the previously
described conformal operators.

from the energy values of the multiplets, it is easy to see that a rational conformal

dimension can be obtained only if h0 + 36 or h0 + 24 are squares of rational numbers.

as in the t 11 case, we obtain rationality when we saturate the bound on the rcharge
of a given harmonic, i.e. when in the young tableaux all the boxes which can be charged
have the same rcharge. this occurs for the representations10 [k , 0] 2
3 k of so(5)ur(1) in
the h0 + 36 case and for [k , 0]1+ 2
3 k in the h0 + 24 case. the corresponding square roots
are given by 6 + 8
3k respectively. we have solved the rationality constraint for
3 k, and we have found that there are two other
the more generic case of [m + n + k , m]1+ 2
innite series of operators with rational dimension, for m and n satisfying the following
relations

3k and 4 + 8

m2  n2  2mn  3n  m = 0,
m2  n2 + 2m(1  n) = 0,

for h0 + 36,

for h0 + 24.

(5.12)

(5.13)

this gives sequences of numbers with no simple rationale. anyway we will see that as for
t 11, beside the case m = n = 0, only another couple of so(5) ur(1) quantum numbers,
is related to shortenings, while all the others correspond to the rational long multiplets
partially noticed in [7] and completely claried in [9]. here these couples are m = 1, n = 0
and m = 1, n = 1 respectively.

let us now introduce these conditions on the so(5) ur(1) quantum numbers in the

 values of the supergravity multiplets and see when the shortening occurs.

we start with the graviton and vector multiplets for which we have some expectations

to be veried and then pass to the gravitino multiplets. the graviton multiplet has

 =

1
2

4qh0 + 36.

if the so(5)  ur(1) irrep is [k , 0] 2

3 k, it reduces to

 = 2 +

2
3

k,

(5.14)

(5.15)

which is the shortening condition  = 1 + s + |y| related to the protected operator (5.11)
corresponding to the massless and short graviton multiplets.

10in the form [young indices]charge = [m + n, m ]y.

18

it can be easily seen that also in the [k + 1 , 1] 2

3 k case, it is obtained a rational state
with  = 3 + 2
3k. these states do not satisfy the shortening condition  = 1 + s + |y|,
but they can be put in correspondence with the rational non supersymmetry protected
operators11

tr (jj abk).

for the vector ii,

 =

4qh0 + 36.

if we choose the [k , 0] 2

3 k irrep., we obtain states with

 =

2
3

k,

(5.16)

(5.17)

(5.18)

which are hypermultiplet ( = |y|) states associated to the k operators. when the
girrep is [k + 1 , 1] 2
3 k, we obtain again a shortening of the multiplet. its anomalous
dimension is given by

 = 1 +

k,

(5.19)

2
3

and is related to the massless gauge vector multiplet of the so(5) matter group or to
short vector multiplets corresponding to tr(j abk) operators.

the other type of vector multiplets we have found never undergo shortening, but we

can easily nd the cft rational long operators. their anomalous dimension is

 =

4qh0 + 36,

which for the [k , 0] 2

this does not correspond to a shortening condition, but nevertheless satises the unitarity

we can obtain unitary multiplets when the g quantum numbers are [k + 2 , 1]1+ 2

having the osp(4|2) and matter group quantum numbers, we can try to guess the
corresponding conformal operators. for k = 0, those related to the short type i gravitinos
are given by

tr l = t rh(cid:16) sas d sbcs  d sas sbcs(cid:17)i ,

while those related to short type ii gravitinos are

(5.31)

(5.32)

tr x = t rhsas (cid:16) sb s d sabs  2 sb d s sabs(cid:17)i ,

which become tr(lk) and tr(xk) for the generic cases (5.27) and (5.29) respectively.
equations (5.31) and (5.32) are easily seen to obey the semiconservation condition (5.6).
we point out that in the l operator, only the irreducible a[bc] representation survives

once we use the matrices identities and the dterm equations.

let us note explicitly that, as anticipated in the introduction the type ii short gravitino
multiplet t r x has a lowest component of rsymmetry y = 1, so that its  component,
which we call w, has y = 0. moreover, it is a singlet under so(5) so that in the infrared
limit w has the same quantum numbers (apart from the conformal dimension) as the
original gauge eld in the ultraviolet limit.

we may compare this result with the gravitino sector supereld of the four dimen-
 in [9].

sional scft dual to the t 11 compactication of type iib theory and called l1k

20

there, the vector eld strength supereld w is the singleton of the conformal theory,
so that it does not appear in the spectrum of t 11 compactication. in the present case
instead, t r [xk] does indeed appear in the spectrum of v(5,2) being a composite eld of
singletons. furthermore, l1k
 does not exist for k = 0, since in this case it would reduce
to [9]

l10
 = t r (ev w ev )

(5.33)

which vanishes identically while t r [xk] is dierent from zero even for k = 0.

finally, for type ii gravitinos, we have in addition states with  = 9

2 + 2

3k corresponding

to long rational multiplets, which can be written as

tr h(s d s)(s d s) lki .

(5.34)

6 summary

in order to collect our results, we present a table where we list the multiplet type as well
as spin, representation and energy of the highest states for mtheory compactied on the
stiefel manifold, and match them with the boundary conformal superelds. these results
merely rely on the ads/cft correspondence.

it remains an open problem to make an explicit construction of the ultraviolet de-

scription of the underlying eld theory in terms of d2brane gauge theory.

appendix a: rescaled connection and curvature on
g/h

in this appendix we present an algebraic technique to derive the rescaled connection and
curvature on a coset manifold given the structure constants of the g, h and g/h groups12
that generalizes the formulae of [35]. the a, b are the coset indices, i, j are the h indices
while ea and i are the vielbeins.

the maurercartan equations for ea and i are

this form of the riemann tensor is more general than the one presented in [35], where
the nal result depended only on the c a
bc due to the hypothesis that
the killing metric be completely diagonal. in our case instead the mixed components ia
are nonzero, while the condition that within an isotropyirreducible subspace the killing
metric is proportional to ab still holds. this is necessary to ensure the antisymmetry of
the connection bab.

it is straightforward to verify that when the killing metric is diagonal, the ca

appendix b:the reduction of so(7) under so(3) 
so(2).

in this section we reduce the so(7) indices to hirreducible indices.

the embedding of so(3)  so(2) in so(7) is dened by

(th)ab = (ch

)(t)ab,

(b.1)

relating the generators of h in an so(7) irrep to the generators of so(7) in the same
irrep through the structure constants. in the vector representation of so(7) one has

and therefore

(t) = 



(th ) = (ch

).

using the expressions for the structure constants one obtains

thus the so(7) vector reduces under h as

where the rst number labels the so(3) irrep, while the second one is the u(1)h charge.

to construct them in the spinor representations we use the following  matrices:

m = ni1  1  2, i1  2  ,i1  3  2o ,
 m = ni2  2  1, i2  2  3,i2   2o ,
7 = i3   .

the charge conjugation matrix is

the n generator in the spinor rep. is thus

c = 1   .
