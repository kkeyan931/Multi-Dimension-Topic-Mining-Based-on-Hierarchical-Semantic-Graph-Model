abstract we review open descendants of non-supersymmetric type iib asymmet-
ric orbifolds with zero cosmological constant. we nd that supersym-
metry remains unbroken on the branes at all mass levels, whereas it is
broken in the bulk.

orbifold compactications which break supersymmetry while keeping
the cosmological constant at one loop, two loop and possibly up to all
orders in perturbation theory to zero, have recently attracted much at-
tention [1]. a modication of the initial four dimensional model led to
a model in ve dimensions, which allows for a heterotic dual, thereby
giving rise to non-vanishing non-perturbative corrections to the cosmo-
logical constant [2]. in the following we will focus on the main results of
the construction of open descendants for harveys model, which has been
worked out in detail in [3] and using a dierent formalism in [4]. for a
more complete list of references and more details we refer the reader to
[3].

parent closed string theory: to begin with, we consider type ii theory
in d = 5 compactied on the lattice [su(2)]4  1,1(r). the radius of
[su(2)] is the self-dual radius r = , whereas the radius of the circle
of the fth coordinate is left arbitrary. then we start modding out this
theory by the asymmetric orbifold, which is generated by the following
two elements [2]:

f = h(14, 1 ; 15) , (04, vl ; 4, vr) , ()fri ,
g = h(15 ; 14, 1) , (4, vr ; 04, vl) , ()fli ,

where  is a shift by r/2 and vl/r shifts the fth coordinate by

r  r(cid:17) ,

which corresponds to a symmetric shift in momentum and winding modes
of 1,1, thereby balancing the level matching condition. the action of
(1)fl/r breaks the space-time supersymmetry of the l/r movers and
therefore the combined action of the orbifold generators f and g will
break supersymmetry completely. note that the above orbifold is non-
abelian from the space group point of view, whereas the point group,
which is obtained by modding out the space group by pure translations,
generated by f 2 and g2, is an abelian asymmetric z2 z2 orbifold. this
transition from the space group to the point group modies the lattice
[su(2)]4 into the lattice [so(8)], which includes a non-trivial ns-ns
antisymmetric tensor bab of rank 2 in the internal lattice. this fact
already hints at a reduction of the resulting gauge group of the open
string spectrum [5, 6, 7]. the above orbifold can be seen as a freely
acting orbifold of t 4/z2 by f .

acting with z2  z2 on the torus partition function, we get the fol-

lowing massless contributions

untw  |v4o4|2 + |s4s4|2  (o4v4)(c 4c4)  (c4c4)(o4v 4) ,

where we used the level one so(4) characters o4, v4, s4 and c4, cor-
responding to the identity, vector, spinor and conjugate spinor repre-
sentation. from the above amplitudes we can immediately read o the
spectrum which, written in terms of ve-dimensional elds, consists in:
the metric, 7 abelian vectors, 6 scalars and 8 fermions from the un-
twisted sector, and 8 abelian vectors, 40 scalars and 16 fermions from
f gtw counts the number of xed
points left invariant by the shifts. this partition function has the re-
markable property that it is non-supersymmetric, but has the same num-
ber of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. moreover, the torus
amplitude is invariant under t-duality and in the limit r   leads
to type iib on t 4/z2 with 21 tensor multiplets coupled to n = (2, 0)
supergravity.

where n+ = 6 and n = 2, revealing the fact that the orientifold planes
carry dierent charges under the  projection. the two dierent choices
 = 1, which have recently been discussed in [8, 7, 9], give rise to a su-
persymmetric open string spectrum for  = 1 and a non-supersymmetric
open string spectrum for  = 1. the spectrum of massless closed un-
oriented excitations then results in the following ve-dimensional elds:
the metric, 2 vectors, 5 scalars and 4 fermions from the untwisted sec-
tor and the f g-twisted sector for  = 1 contains 2 vectors, 26 scalars
and 8 fermions whereas for  = 1 it comprises 14 scalars, 6 vectors
and 8 fermions. for both choices the spectrum has bose-fermi degener-
acy. since the klein bottle amplitude only feels the left-right symmetric
part of the torus amplitude, it is supersymmetric and thus results in a
vanishing 1-loop contribution to the cosmological constant.

the open string sector is obtained by adding the direct annulus am-
plitude to the direct channel mobius strip.
in the following we will
concentrate on the choice  = 1. since the ve dimensional theory is in-
variant under t -duality, the annulus amplitude has to be parameterized
by charges, that represent a linear combination of d9 and d5 branes.
for the massless contribution to the direct annulus amplitude, we thus
get:

a(0)

4n[i 2

m + r2

m ](v4o4  s4s4) + [i 2

m  r2

m ](o4v4  c4c4)o ,

where im denotes the sum of chan-paton charges, whereas rm param-
eterizes the gauge symmetry breaking, induced by the orbifold action.
for the mobius amplitude one has two options:

m(0)

1 

1
2

im ( v4 o4  s4 s4) , m(0)

2  

1
2

im ( o4 v4  c4 c4)

where for the second mobius amplitude, we introduced a discrete wil-
son line. inspection of the above mobius amplitudes requires the gauge
group to be symplectic in the rst case and unitary in the second. tad-
pole conditions give im = 16 and rm = 0, which can be extracted from
the transverse channel amplitudes k(0), m(0) and a(0). this xes the
size of the gauge group. in order to have a consistent particle interpre-
tation of a(0) + m(0) we have to choose

1.)
2.)

im = m1 + m2 , rm = m1  m2
im = m + m , rm = i(m  m )

the resulting spectrum in the rst case comprises a vector in the ad-
joint of sp(8)2 and a hypermultiplet in the bifundamental representa-
tion (8, 8) and in the second case a vector in the adjoint of u(8) and a
hypermultiplets in 28  28.

in the limit r  0, the amplitudes reveal that new tadpoles arise, due
to odd windings that become massless. on the other hand, taking the
limit r   one recovers the two six dimensional models with quantized
antisymmetric tensor background [10, 6, 7] and gauge group sp(8)4
with matter in the representations (8, 8, 1, 1), (8, 1, 8, 1), (1, 8, 1, 8), and
(1, 1, 8, 8) for the rst case and gauge group u(8)2 with matter in the
representations (28  28, 1), (1, 28  28), (8, 8) and (8, 8) for the second
case.
