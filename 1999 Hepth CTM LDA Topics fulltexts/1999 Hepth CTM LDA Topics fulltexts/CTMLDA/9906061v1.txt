abstract

a eld theoretic description of monopole condensation in strongly coupled

gauge theories is given by actions involving antisymmetric tensors b of rank 2.

we rederive the corresponding action for 4d compact qed, summing explicitly

over all possible monopole congurations.

its gauge symmetries and ward

identities are discussed. then we consider the wilsonian rgs for yang-mills

theories in the presence of collective elds (again tensors b ) for the eld
strengths f a

 associated to the u(1) subgroups. we show that a vector-like
ward identity for the wilsonian action involving b , whose validity corres-

ponds to monopole condensation, constitutes a xed point of the wilsonian rg

ow.

1 introduction

recently progress has been made in the eld theoretic formulation of monopole

condensation in strongly coupled gauge theories, which has been proposed by thooft

and mandelstam [1] as the underlying mechanism of connement in qcd. quevedo

and trugenberger [2] have proposed the kinetic parts (quadratic in the elds) of
actions in d space-time dimensions describing the condensation of (d  r  1) dimen-
sional topological defects by the means of antisymmetric tensors of rank r. applied to

monopole condensation in gauge theories in d = 4 the corresponding action requires

the introduction of a kalb-ramond eld b of rank 2.

starting with the dual formulation of compact qed in d = 3 [3] (where the topo-

logical defects have dimension 0), polyakov [4] derived a partition function involving

b, which couples to the surface of the wilson loop. (this coupling has also been

considered in [2].) one of the aims of polyakov was to show how a second quantized

string theory emerges due to the multivaluedness of the action of b in minkowski

space. the massive kalb-ramond eld b in polyakovs action plays exactly the

role assigned to it in [2]. employing a duality transformation beyond the semiclassi-

cal approximation (which was used by polyakov), and working in d = 4, diamantini,

quevedo and trugenberger [5] rederived the result of polyakov, again with the dual

formulation of compact qed (involving a massive vector in d = 4) as a starting point.

in [6] (see also [7]) we had introduced rank 2 tensor elds in yang-mills theories

as collective elds for the eld strength tensor f a

, in some analogy with the eld
strength formulation of yang-mills theories [8,9]. using the wilsonian exact renor-

malization group equations (erges) in the presence of the collective elds we have

argued in [6] that the quadratic part of the wilsonian eective action in the infrared

limit assumes a particular form, which is equivalent to the quevedo-trugenberger

and polyakov action [2,4]. a non-trivial phenomenological test of this approach

consists in the computation of the eld strength two-point function, which is now

given in terms of the two-point function of b [10,11], and which agrees well with

lattice results.

the aim of the present paper is twofold: first, in section 2, we reconsider four-

dimensional compact qed on the lattice. without passing by the dual formulation

2

involving the massive vector eld, we will show directly, how monopole condensation

lets the kalb-ramond eld b appear, and we will rederive its action by explicit

summation over monopole congurations. our approach also allows to discuss expli-

citly, how vector-like gauge symmetries (under which b transforms) together with

gauge xing terms appear in a formulation, where both b and the original gauge

eld a are present in the action. we emphasize the role of an associated ward

identity in this formulation. we also discuss how a can be gauged away without

modifying the number of degrees of freedom, whereupon one recovers polyakovs

formulation involving just a massive b eld without manifest gauge invariance.

second, in section 3, we consider the wilsonian erges for yang-mills theories

in the maximal abelian gauge, and in the presence of collective elds ba

 for the
diagonal components of the eld strength tensor f a
 (the index a being associated
with the generators of the n  1 u(1) subgroups of su(n)). we present a modied
vector-like ward identity (depending explicitly on the wilsonian infrared cuto k)

which a) is invariant under the erg ow, and describes thus xed points (actual-

ly still an innite dimensional stable subclass) of wilsonian eective actions, and

b) which turns into the ward identity satised by the quevedo-trugenberger and
polyakov actions for k  0. the role of this ward identity for wilsonian yang-mills
eective action in the infrared limit is discussed in section 4.

2 compact qed

let us start with the partition function of compact qed on the lattice, following

closely the presentation of polyakov [3]. we will work in d = 4 euclidean dimensions;

our results can, however, straightforwardly be carried over to arbitrary dimensions,

and sometimes we will let d to be arbitrary.

on a lattice with lattice spacing  = 1 the action of compact qed is given by

s =

1

2e2 xx

(1  cos f(x))

,

where the sum over ,  at each lattice site x is understood, and

f = a  a

3

(2.1)

(2.2)

with  being the lattice (forward) derivative. the elds a are restricted to the do-
main   a  . neglecting higher powers than f 2
the periodicity of the cosine, the partition function can be written as [3]

 in the action, but respecting

z = xn (x)z +
 yx

[da (a)] e

.

(2.3)

(f (x)2n (x))2

 1

4e2px

here the antisymmetric tensor n(x) represents a set of 6 independent integers

(in d = 4) at each lattice site. for later convenience we have added a gauge xing

-function (a). due to the restricted domain of integration over a such a gauge

xing is actually not mandatory; it just amounts to the multiplication of z by a nite

factor per lattice site.

next we introduce a hodge decomposition of the 6 independent integers n per

lattice site:

n = [m] + b

.

(2.4)

the vector m satises m = 0 and represents thus d  1 = 3 independent degrees
of freedom. the antisymmetric tensor b satises b = 0, which constitute
d  1 = 3 constraints in d = 4. the remaining 3 degrees of freedom in b can be
represented in terms of a conserved monopole current density eq (with eq = 0) in

the form

the integer monopole currents q, situated at centres zi of the lattice cubes, are

related to the density eq by

eq(z) =xi

q(zi) e(z  zi)

(2.7)

where e(z  zi) denotes the kronecker symbol, e(z  zi) = 1 for z = zi, e(z  zi) = 0

otherwise. introducing a dual eld strength h for b,

h =

1
2

 b

,

(2.8)

4

integrating (2.5) over a lattice cube with surface pi one obtains

.

1
2

 b = eq
2ipi

1

b d = q(zi)

.

(2.5)

(2.6)

the sum over n in the partition function (2.3) can be replaced by sums over m and

b, together with the corresponding constraints:

 yx hda  (a) b (m) bd1 (b)i

(f 2[m]2b )2

z = xm(x) xb (x)z +
x
eq(z)yz bd1 (h(z) eq(z)) e

 1

4e2px

.

(2.9)

here b denote again kronecker symbols, now in eld space. the d  1 dimensional
kronecker symbol of a conserved vector v,bd1(v) with v = 0, can be represented

as

[dc (c)] e

.

(2.10)

cv

ipx

bd1(v) = const.z +
 yx

next we can combine the gauge eld a with the integers m into a single eld a
,
which varies from  to + at each lattice site:

a

 = a + 2m

.

(2.11)

at this point the introduction of the gauge xing  function in (2.3) proves to be

convenient. omitting the primes of a

, the partition function becomes

 yx hda (a) bd1 (b)ix
z = xb (x)z +
4e2px

(f 2b )2

eq(z)yz bd1 (h(z) eq(z))

e

 1

.

(2.12)

our next aim is the explicit evaluation of the sum over monopole current congura-

tions eq(z). first, we decompose all possible congurations eq(z) into congurations,

which are nonvanishing at n centres of the lattice cubes:

=

xn =0

1

n! xz1...zn xq(zi)6=0

x
eq(z)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) eq(z)=

npi=1

q(zi)e(zzi)

.

(2.13)

second, we observe that contributions to the partition function with |q(zi)|  2 are
suppressed relatively to congurations with q(zi) = 1 [3]; therefore we will restrict
the sum over q(zi) to these values subsequently. third, the corresponding term
 b2
 in the action in (2.12) is problematic even for these restricted congurations:
near a monopole current situated at z the eld b(x) behaves like |x  z|3 (in

5

d = 4), consequently the continuum integral r d4xb2

whereas on the lattice we are left with an ambiguity in the form of a factor

 would diverge quadratically,

 = e const.

e2

(2.14)

per centre with nonvanishing monopole current. taking the n powers of  into

account we thus rewrite the sum over eq(z) as

eq(z)yz bd1 (h(z) eq(z))

xn =0

n!

n xz1...zn xq(zi)=1bd1 h(z) 

nxi=1

q(zi)e(z  zi)! . (2.15)

let us now x z, n and the lorentz index  and investigate, in which cases the sums

over zi and q(zi) give a nonvanishing contribution to the monopole current density

eq(z) =

nxi=1

q(zi) e(z  zi)

(2.16)

in the argument of the kronecker symbol bd1(h(z)  eq(z)). let us assume that
the lattice has v sites. then, a sum over a variable zi and the associated monopole
in (2v  2) cases the contribution to eq(z)
current q(zi) = 1 gives 2v terms.
vanishes, since zi diers from z and e(z  zi) is zero. the two remaining cases give
contributions eq = 1 to eq. turning to the sums over n variables zi and associated
monopole currents q(zi) = 1 we can decompose the result into powers of (2v  2):
we have (2v  2)n cases, where no zi coincides with z, and where eq vanishes. we
have 2n(2v  2)n 1 cases, where one zi coincides with z; these 2n(2v  2)n 1 cases
can be decomposed into n(2v  2)n 1 cases with eq = +1 and n(2v  2)n 1 cases
with eq = 1. next we have 1
2  (2n)  (2n  2)  (2v  2)n 2 cases where two zi
coincide with z; a quarter of them corresponds to eq = +2, half of them to eq = 0
(since eq(zi) = eq(zj) with zi = zj = z), and the remaining quarter to eq = 2.
m(cid:17)(2v  2)n m 2m cases where m variables zi coincide with z.
in general we have (cid:16)n
the corresponding contributions to eq are generally dierent; if we distinguish these
contributions to eq we can write the dierent cases as
!(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)eq=2m
m!(2v  2)n m" mx=0 m
 n



(2.17)

6

where the expression in the squared brackets gives 2m terms. summing over m we

can thus rewrite the expression (2.15) as

yz

xn =

1
n!

n

nxm=0 n

m!(2v  2)n m

mx=0 m

!bd1 (h(z)  2 + m)

.

(2.18)

the sums can be rearranged and partially evaluated; as an intermediate result one

obtains

e(2v 2)

yz

n+ 1

x=0

xn=0

n!! bd1 (h(z)   + n)

.

(2.19)

employing the kronecker symbol in order to perform either of the sums over  or

n one ends up with a standard series representation for a modied bessel function
[12] and, omitting the eld independent prefactor exp (2v  2), the result becomes
simply

ih(z) (2) = epz,

yz,

log ih (z)(2)

(2.20)

where we have restored the summation over the lorentz index .

the same result has been obtained previously by diamantini, quevedo and tru-

genberger [5] with the help of an exact duality transformation of the partition function

of the massive dual gauge eld. as noted in [5], in the semiclassical approximation
h  ,   , h/ xed the exponent in (2.20) becomes [13]
 + 42!  sp (h)

xz  h arcsinh  h

2! +qh 2

(2.21)

whereupon one recovers the euclidean four-dimensional version of polyakovs action

sp (h) in [4].

with the result for the summation over monopole congurations at hand we are

in a position to rewrite the partition function (2.12). for convenience we switch to

a continuum notation, and rescale the elds such that the kinetic terms are properly
normalized: a  e1
 + o(h 4),
where 0 is the inverse lattice spacing. we obtain

0 a, b  21

0 b such that 4

0sp (h) = 1

2h 2

z =z dadb(a)d1(b) er d4x{ 1

4 (f mb )2+sp (h)}

where the mass m of the kalb-ramond eld b is given by

m2 =

82
e2 2

0

.

7

(2.22)

(2.23)

in the weak eld limit of sp (h), the action in (2.22) coincides with the 4d version of

the action proposed by quevedo and trugenberger [2] to describe the condensation

of topological defects.

now there are two options concerning a subsequent treatment of the partition

function (2.22): the rst option consists in a eld redenition

b  b +

1
m

f

.

(2.24)

since h is invariant under this redenition of b by a bianci identity, the gauge

eld a disappears completely from the action and appears only in the  functions
(a)d1(b + 1
mf). since the number of  functions matches precisely the
number of degrees of freedom of a, the a path integral can be performed giving

just trivial (eld independent) determinants. the resulting partition function reads

z (1) =z db er d4x{ 1

4 m2b2

 +sp (h)}

,

(2.25)

which is the version derived by polyakov [4].

the second way to treat the partition function (2.22) consists in the standard

procedure to promote the  functions to gauge xing terms in the action: first, we

replace the  functions by

 (a  c) d1 (b  c)

(2.26)

where c, c are arbitrary functions with c = 0. next, we integrate over these

functions with a gaussian measure involving arbitrary gauge xing parameters  and

; the resulting partition functions reads (again up to eld independent fadeev-popov

determinants)

with

z (2) =z dadb esinv sgf

sinv =z d4x(cid:26)1
sgf =z d4x( 1

here sgf serves to gauge x the gauge symmetries of sinv:

a =  ,

a = m

b = 0
b =   

.

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)

these gauge symmetries are actually not independent; the transformation a) is ob-
tained from b) after identifying  = m1. a remnant of the gauge invariance b)

is the following ward identity, which is satised by the total action st = sinv + sgf :

(2.30)

the standard ward identity related to the gauge invariance a) is obtained by con-

tracting (2.30) with .

herewith we conclude this section and turn now to a possible relation between st

and the low energy eective action of pure yang-mills theories.

3 wilsonian rg ow for yang-mills theories with

antisymmetric tensor elds

let us start this section with the denition of the partition function of an eu-

clidean yang-mills theory. subsequently we will employ the maximal abelian gauge

[7,9,14]. abelian gauges were originally introduced by thooft [1], who showed that

they lead to the appearance of magnetic monopoles in yang-mills theories. below it

will be useful that abelian ward identities related to u(1) subgroups of su(n) remain

valid in the maximal abelian gauge [14]. including gauge xing terms and ghosts, the

yang-mills partition function reads:

exp{g(j, , )} =z dreg(a, c, c) expnsy m sgf sgh +ja+ c+ co (3.1)

where we used the short-hand notation

j  a =z d4x j 

 (x) a

(x)

etc.

(3.2)

the index reg attached to the path integral measure indicates an ultraviolet regu-

larisation. sy m denotes the standard yang-mills action, sgf the gauge xing terms,

and sgh the terms depending on the ghost elds. in the maximal abelian gauge it
is convenient to adopt following conventions: we decompose the n 2  1 generators
of su(n) indexed by ,  = 1 . . . n 2  1 into the n  1 generators of the n  1

9

u(1) subgroups with n  1 indices a, b and the n(n  1) non-diagonal charged
generators indexed by i, j = 1 . . . n(n 1). it is helpful to introduce a u(1)-covariant
derivative d, which acts on the charged elds i = {ai

, ci, ci} as

di = i + gf i

ajaa

j

.

the yang-mills action thus decomposes as

sy m =z d4x

the maximal abelian gauge corresponds to gauge xing terms of the form

(3.5)

i.e. the gauge xing of the charged gauge elds ai

of sgh is not relevant subsequently.
now we add collective elds ba

 to the partition
function (3.1). the addition of collective elds corresponds to a multiplication of the

 for the u(1) eld strengths f a

integrand of the path integral with

1 =

n z db exp{bs} ,

bs =z d4x(cid:26)1

moreover we add the following source term to the exponent under the path integral:

if one performs the gaussian path integral over b in the presence of the source terms

obtains terms quadratic in the sources. the expression for the partition function

 couples to the operator f a

nally becomes

expng(cid:16)j, , , bj(cid:17)o =z d (a, c, c, b) exp {s(a, b)  sgf  sgh + sources}

(cid:27)

where we employ the convention (3.2). for later use we introduce the eective action

sources = j  a +   c +   c + bj  b

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(a, c, c, b), the legendre transform of g(j, , , bj):

(a, c, c, b) = g(j, , , bj) + j  a +   c +   c + bj  b .

the wilsonian erges [1518] are obtained by adding an artical infrared cuto

k to the partition function (3.1) or (3.8). one exploits the facts that the corresponding

k dependent eective action k a) is equal to the full quantum eective action 
for k = 0, b) corresponds to the classical action scl in the limit k   (up to
additional terms determined by modied slavnov-taylor identities [16,17]), and c)

that an exact functional dierential equation with respect to k (the erge) can be

derived. the integration of the erges from some large value k =  down to k = 0

provides us with a non-perturbative method for calculating k=0 in terms of some
high energy efective action   scl. the formalism can straightforwardly be
extended towards partition functions involving sources for collective elds [18,6,11],
provided scl is replaced by sy m + bs = s(a, b).

let us consider directly the partition function (3.8) with the collective elds in-

cluded. in the presence of an infrared cuto it becomes

expngk(cid:16)j, , , bj(cid:17)o
=z d (a, c, c, b) exp {s(a, b)  sgf  sgh  sk + sources}

(3.12)

where sk is quadratic in the gluon and ghost elds:

sk =z

suppressed. possible choices are

,

.

(3.14)

infrared cutos for the collective elds could also be introduced [18] but are not

mandatory. the erges for the functional gk follow after dierentiation of both

sides of (3.12) with respect to k, and expressing the expectation value < ksk >

through variations with respect to the sources. one obtains

kgk = z

(3.15)

the erges for k, the legendre transform of gk, can easily be obtained from (3.15),

but they are not needed in the following.

now we wish to show that a slight variant of the ward identity (2.30), which

implies the (gauge xed) vector like gauge symmetry b) in eq. (2.29), constitutes a

(quasi) xed point of the erges. to this end we study the following functional k,a
 ,
which is constructed in terms of sources, gk (satisfying the erges (3.15)), and the
ir cuto function rk:

k,a

. (3.16)

first we note that, for k  0, rk and hence the last term in k,a
remaining 4 terms in 0,a


 vanishes. the
can be expressed in terms of 0, the eective action at

vanishing ir cuto k, through the legendre transform (3.11):

(3.17)

12

thus the functional equation

is equivalent to the statement that 0 satises the ward identity (2.30).

0,a

 = 0

(3.18)

next we consider the variation of k,a

 with respect to the infrared cuto k. when
one evaluates kk,a
as in eq.(3.16), the derivative k hits gk and the
ir cuto function rk. using the erge (3.15) for kgk one obtains the following

 with k,a


important result:

kk,a

 = 0

if k,a

 = 0 .

(3.19)

hence the functional equation k,a

 = 0  either in terms of gk or in terms of k 
constitutes a quasi-xed point of the erges. if it is satised by gk or k for some

k, it will also be satised by g0 and 0, i.e. 0 will satisfy the ward identity (2.30).

let us dene an abelian projection 0 of 0 by

0 = 0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)i=0

,

(3.20)

where i denote all charged elds ai

, ci, ci with respect to the u(1) subgroups,
cf. our convention for the indices below eq. (3.2). trivially, once 0 satises the
ward identity (2.30), it is also satised by 0(aa
). up to terms quadratic in
the elds and derivatives, the general solution for 0 is then necessarily of the form
of the weak eld limit of sinv + sgf in eqs. (2.28), i.e. of the form of the quevedo-

, ba

trugenberger action describing the condensation of magnetic monopoles. the terms

involving higher powers of the dual eld strength h of the kalb-ramond eld b,

which appear in polyakovs action sp (h) in (2.21) and (2.28), also satisfy the ward

identity, but cannot be derived by the ward identity alone.

remember that, in the process of computing k=0 by integrating the erges with

respect to k, a boundary condition  at some large scale k =  has to be specied.

in our case  is given by the action s(a, b) of eq. (3.9), up to gauge xing terms
for the gluons, and up to additional terms of o(g2r) in order to satisfy the modied
slavnov-taylor identities [16,17].
it is easily checked that the abelian projection
 does not satisfy the ward identity (2.30) (for   ), since the three terms
2f af a  1
4baba are not of the form of a square. trivially, the classical
yang-mills action does not describe connement by monopole condensation, even if

2 f aba + 1

1

collective elds ba

 are introduced.

13

during the erge ow all parameters in k will vary with k; the erge ow can

be represented as a motion in the innite dimensional space of couplings (parameters)

of k. couplings, which are absent in , but not protected by the modied slavnov-
taylor identities, will become non-zero, as powers of h or terms of the form (b)2.
a priori it is an open question whether, for some value of k, the terms involving f a
combine with terms involving ba into combinations of the form (f a  mba), where a
k-independent parameter m is generated dynamically by dimensional transmutation.

a necessary condition for this to happen is that the xed point k,a

 = 0, with some

arbitrary (k independent dynamically generated value) of , is infrared attractive.

indications for such an infrared attractiveness can be obtained from the results

in [6], where the rg ow of the a/b system has been studied in a simple appro-
ximation (however, in [6] antisymmetric tensor elds were introduced for all n 2  1
components of f, and the landau gauge was employed): within a parametrization

of k(a, b) of the form

k(a, b) =

z
4

(f)2 

n
2

fb +

m2
4

(b)2 + gauge xing terms

(3.21)

it was shown that

zef f = z 

n2
m2 = 0

,

(3.22)

whereupon f and b combine into a perfect square, constitutes an infrared xed point.

at the starting point, where (a, b) is given by s(a, b) of eq. (3.9), we have z = 2,

n = m and hence zef f () = 1. however, already perturbatively, zef f (k) decreases

with decreasing k and approaches thus the xed point (3.22).

within the simple approximation in [6], on the other hand, a landau singularity
in the running gauge coupling prevented a detailed analysis of the regime k  0. this
problem disappeared within a less trivial truncation of k in [11], where the gauge
coupling became even vanishingly small for k  0.

whereas the dependence of the results of [6,11] on the truncation of k is an open

problem, we emphasize that the xed point nature of the ward identity, eq. (3.19),

is completely general.

a nal remark concerns the relevance of the maximal abelian gauge for our results:

14

since the abelian ward identities (several in the case of several u(1)s) follow from the

vector ward identity k,a
condition on k, if k is assumed to satisfy k,a

 = 0 after contraction with p, their validity is a necessary
 = 0. this necessary condition is

guaranteed to be satised precisely in the maximal abelian gauge.

4 summary and conclusions

the aim of the present paper is to emphasize the role of antisymmetric tensor

elds for the description of monopole condensation in strongly coupled gauge theories.

in the rst part of the paper we have studied four-dimensional compact qed on the

lattice, and we have rederived two equivalent versions of the partition function: the

rst version involves just a massive kalb-ramond eld b, and the original abelian

gauge eld a, has disappeared completely (it has been eaten by b in order to

become massive, in the same way as goldstone bosons are eaten by massive vector

elds in the case of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking). the corresponding action

had been obtained by polyakov [4] and diamantini, quevedo and trugenberger [5]

before, starting with the dual action involving a massive vector eld. here we have

shown how to obtain this action directly from compact qed.

the second version of the partition function involves both the gauge eld a and

the kalb-ramond eld b, but additional gauge xing terms which x, in particular,

the vector-like gauge symmetry under which b transforms. the quadratic part of

the action is a special (4d) case of actions proposed by quevedo and trugenberger [2]

in order to describe the condensation of topological defects. here we have emphasized

a ward identity related to the vector gauge symmetry, whose validity is a sucient

condition on the action in order to be of the quevedo-trugenberger form.

in the second part of the paper we have studied the wilsonian exact renorma-

lization group ow of pure yang-mills theories in the maximal abelian gauge, and

in the presence of auxiliary elds ba

 of the
eld strength. we have introduced a modied (k-dependent) vector ward identity

 for the diagonal components f a

k,a

 (k) = 0 and shown that its validity is stable under the erg ow. at vani-
its validity does not

shing ir cuto k it coincides with the ward identity above.

x k completely, but constrains the innitely many couplings in k to lay inside a

15

xed hyperplane in the innite dimensional space of couplings. this picture can

be represented schematically as in fig. 1: the plane in fig. 1 represents the innite

dimensional space of couplings of actions depending on abelian gauge elds a and

kalb-ramond elds b. the curve w represents the hyperplane on which the

vector ward identity is satised.

wilsonian actions of yang-mills theories can be represented on this plane, once

auxiliary elds ba

 are introduced, and once they are projected onto the abelian
subsector. their erg ow is represented by the curve y m in fig. 1. the starting

point of the erg ow is denoted by the point p (perturbation theory), which

is certainly not on the curve w . at the point q the wilsonian yang-mills action

would satisfy the vector ward identity, and the interesting question is whether it is

assumed in the limit of vanishing ir cuto k. we have shown that it is a xed point

of the erg ow, and that it is ir stable in a particular direction in the space of

couplings; the general ir stability remains to be shown. furthermore, perturbatively

the erg ow is from p towards q, which is indicated by the arrow  this is related

to the decrease of the wave function renormalization of the diagonal gluons, which

gives the increase of the gauge coupling in the maximal abelian gauge due to the

abelian ward identity [14]. clearly further investigations of properties of wilsonian

yang-mills actions near the point q are highly desirable.
