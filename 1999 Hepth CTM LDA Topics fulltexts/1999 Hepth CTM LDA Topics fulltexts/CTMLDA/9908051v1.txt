abstract

canonical quantization of abelian bf -type topological eld theory coupled to
extended sources on generic d-dimensional manifolds and with curved line bun-
dles is studied. sheaf cohomology is used to construct the appropriate topolog-
ical extension of the action and the topological ux quantization conditions, in
terms of the cech cohomology of the underlying spatial manifold, as required
for topological invariance of the quantum eld theory. the wavefunctions are
found in the hamiltonian formalism and are shown to carry multi-dimensional
projective representations of various topological groups of the space. expres-
sions for generalized linking numbers in any dimension are thereby derived.
in particular, new global aspects of motion group presentations are obtained
in any dimension. applications to quantum exchange statistics of objects in
various dimensionalities are also discussed.

1. introduction

topological gauge theories involving higher-rank antisymmetric tensor elds have been
of much interest over the years. the simplest example of such a model is bf theory
[1][3] which provides a quantum eld theoretical framework for understanding various
important topological invariants.
in the abelian case, the partition function computes
the ray-singer analytic torsion of the underlying spacetime manifold [1, 3, 4] while the
correlation functions of higher-rank holonomy operators (the appropriate generalizations
of wilson loop operators) compute linking and intersection numbers of manifolds of var-
ious dimensionalities [3, 5]. these models have also been of interest in a wide variety of
physical applications in which non-local holonomy eects arising from processes involving
adiabatic transports of extended objects, such as strings, play a signicant role [6]. re-
cent interest in non-abelian bf theory has been sparked by the realization that it serves
as a dual model for yang-mills theory and quantum chromodynamics in four dimensions
[7] and thereby provides a computational tool in which the non-perturbative sector of
the relevant quantum eld theory can be analysed quantitatively. bf theory has also
played a signicant role in various models of low dimensional quantum gravity [8]. an
introduction to the applications of bf theory in four dimensional quantum gravity may
be found in [9], while a general concise introduction to topological quantum eld theory
is given in [10].

in this paper we will study a general class of abelian topological bf theories and use
it to describe some topological invariants of manifolds of generic dimension. the basic
mathematical motivation comes from a well-known classication problem in geometric
topology. in the classication theory of three-dimensional manifolds m3, an important
invariant is the topological class of a mapping of the circle s1 into m3 such that no two
points of the loop intersect on m3. the study of all such embeddings is known as knot
theory. knots in dimensions other than three are always trivial, but in three dimensions
there is a vast collection of such topological classes which live in the fundamental homotopy
group 1(m3) of the manifold. an algebraic entity related to knot theory is the braid
group of a two-dimensional space [11, 12]. a braid of n strands can be viewed as a
collection of overlapping lines on the plane.
it is a fundamental theorem of geometric
topology that any collection of knots or links can be constructed by joining the ends of
a certain braid. the braid group is therefore a useful tool for the classication of three-
manifolds. these structures can all be generalized to higher dimensional embeddings into
higher dimensional manifolds to form objects known as motion groups [13, 14] which are
the appropriate generalizations of braid groups. the motion group is a useful tool in
the topological classication of manifolds whose properties have only been touched upon
briey in the mathematics literature.

polynomial invariants of knots in three dimensions and of two-knots in four dimensions
are derived in [15, 16] from observables in various versions of abelian and non-abelian bf

1

eld theories. in the following we will obtain a special class of multi-dimensional abelian
unitary representations of generic motion groups in manifolds of generic dimension. this
analysis sheds some light on the global structures involved in the algebraic and geometric
denitions of motion groups in general. just as the braid group and its representations
via chern-simons gauge theory [17][19] arise from the statistical exchange holonomies
between quantum mechanical point particles in two spatial dimensions, the quantum
holonomies induced in the wavefunctions for bf gauge elds coupled minimally to higher
dimensional worldvolumes lead to the appropriate motion group representations and are
relevant to the description of exchange statistics between extended objects in higher spa-
tial dimensions. the possibility of exotic statistics between strings in three dimensions
was considered in several dierent contexts in [6] and analysed in some more generality
in [20]. field theoretical models using four dimensional bf theory were described in
[21][23] and related to features of the motion group. the class of quantum eld theo-
ries analysed in this paper is relevant to more general models of d-branes and m-branes
which have played a fundamental role in the present understanding of the dynamics of
superstring theory and m-theory. the results obtained in the following describe various
geometrical aspects of antisymmetric tensor elds with non-trivial topological charges and
present an essential description of the quantum eld theory for these extended objects.

we will be particularly interested in global aspects of these topological eld theories
and their associated motion group representations. the basic modications which arise
when the line bundle of the gauge theory is topologically non-trivial can be understood
easiest in terms of the global gauge group of the bf theory. for a bf eld theory
constructed from a p-form eld and a corresponding dual d  p  1-form eld which are
sections of a trivial vector bundle over a d-dimensional manifold md, the harmonic zero
mode contributions of the elds to the corresponding path integral produce a grassmann
parity graded direct sum of derham cohomology groups [3],

the appropriate modication for curved vector bundles of the treatment of the harmonic
zero modes is described in general in [24] and applied to abelian bf theory in [25]. it
is found there that the zero mode space (1.1) is modied by the cech cohomology of the
manifold md. in the following we will describe this modication within the framework
of canonical quantization. we shall use sheaf cohomology in a rather straightforward
way [19, 26] that is much simpler than the covariant approach of [24] which requires
the use of cech hyper-cohomology complexes and higher rank bundles whose properties
are not very well-understood except in some lower dimensional cases [27, 28]. as we
will show, the present sheaf cohomological approach is particularly well-suited for the
canonical quantization of the source-coupled bf theory, but is extremely cumbersome
for a path integral treatment along the lines of [24, 25]. conversely, the former approach
is not very useful in a canonical framework because the various degrees of freedom in the

2

decompositions of the elds are not very well understood. having obtained the appropriate
modication of the bf action which incorporates global eects, we will then be able
to deduce the corresponding constraints that the generators of the motion group on a
homologically non-trivial manifold must satisfy.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2 we describe, using sheaf cohomol-
ogy, the modications of the bf eld theory action that must be made when the relevant
gauge elds are sections of a non-trivial line bundle. we show how this modication sim-
plies within a canonical framework and also derive a topological quantization constraint
on the uxes of the gauge elds in terms of the cech cohomology of the manifold which
ensures that the quantum eld theory is indeed topologically invariant. in section 3 we
introduce the parametrizations of the elds that will be used and study the canonical
structure of the eld theory. we illustrate here how the appropriate modication to (1.1)
arises in the canonical formalism through strong gauge constraints which relate the global
uxes of the gauge elds to the external charges of the theory.
in section 4 we solve
explicitly for the wavefunctions of the quantum eld theory in the functional schrodinger
representation and show how the sheaf cohomological constraints ensure that they are
indeed topological invariants. one important ingredient in this construction is the deriva-
tion of a generalized solid angle function which computes the adiabatic linking numbers
of embedded surfaces of generic dimension. in section 5 we introduce the motion group
and describe some of its formal mathematical properties, and then proceed to describe
the holonomy representations of it carried by the wavefunctions of the canonical quantum
eld theory. section 6 then concludes with some examples, applications and directions for
further generalizations. we show how the standard braid group representations induced
from chern-simons gauge theory on a riemann surface [18, 19] are recovered within the
present formalism but with some global modications. these global modications are
also shown to occur for the quantum exchange holonomies of equal rank extended objects
in higher dimensions. the main feature is that the bf formalism avoids the cumber-
some self-linking numbers that arise in chern-simons theory [19] which are regularization
dependent. physically this is understood as an inducing of an intrinsic spin to the p  1-
branes by the doubling of eld theoretical degrees of freedom in the present case, which
then cancels the statistical phases which appear because the spin-statistics theorem holds
in these special situations. this is in contrast to the case of strings in three spatial di-
mensions, whereby the spin-statistics theorem need not hold in certain cases [20]. the
generalizations of the standard gauss linking integral are also derived.

2. global aspects of topological bf field theory

in this section we shall describe some general aspects of bf -type topological eld
theories. starting with a quick review of the well-known situation when the theory is

3

dened using at vector bundles, we then describe the required modications of the eld
theory when the associated bundle lives in a non-trivial topological class.

2.1. bf theory on trivial line bundles

consider the eld theory of a real-valued p-form eld b  p(md+1) and a real-
valued d  p-form eld a  dp(md+1) dened on the spacetime manifold md+1 of
dimension d + 1 with metric of minkowski signature. we assume in this subsection that
these dierential forms take values in some at vector bundle over md+1. the bf -action
is given by the space-time integral of a d + 1-form

s = zmd+1

k
2

b  da

(2.1)

where k  r is a coupling constant. this action is invariant under the u(1) gauge
transform

where  is a closed d  p-form, d = 0, and it transforms by a surface term under

a  a + 

b  b + 

(2.2)

(2.3)

where  is a closed p-form, d = 0. in the present eld theory without sources any closed
forms are allowed in (2.2) and (2.3). however, when this topological eld theory is coupled
to sources we also require gauge invariance of the holonomy operators

w [p] = exp iip

b

,

w [dp] = exp i idp

a

(2.4)

this restricts the class of closed forms allowed in (2.2) and (2.3) to those of integer-valued
cohomology, so that

 = 2np

,

 = 2ndp

(2.5)

ip

idp

for some integers np and ndp and for any compact, closed orientable submanifolds p
and dp of md+1. in the following, we shall assume this restricted gauge symmetry.

the partition function is given by the path integral

h1i = zm

d(a, b) exp i zmd+1

k
2

b  da

(2.6)

which is normalized by the volume of the gauge group. the functional measure d(a, b)
on the moduli space m of gauge orbits is obtained by the standard gauge-xing procedure
to give1

d(a, b) = da db fp[a] fp[b] (f [a]) (g[b])

(2.7)
1this is the conventional parametrization for the partition function. in [4] an alternative
parametrization in terms of hodge decompositions of the elds (see section 3.1) is implemented
which avoids using the brst gauge xing procedure.

4

where fp denotes the usual faddeev-popov determinant, and f and g are gauge-xing
functions. this path integral is related to the ray-singer analytic torsion which is a
topological invariant of md+1 given by properties of the spectrum of the dierential
operators d and  d and the laplacian ( denotes the hodge duality operator of md+1).
here it is given explicitly by the ratio of determinants [1, 3, 4, 10]

h1i =

p

yk=0

detk


pk

dp

yl=0

detl


dpl

,

k  (1)k+1 2k + 1

4

(2.8)

where k is the laplacian acting on k(md+1) and det denotes the regularized deter-
minant with zero modes arising from gauge invariance excluded.

gauge and topologically invariant operators are given by p-cycle holonomies of b and
d  p-cycle holonomies of a. the expectation value of the operators (2.4) is given by the
path integral with sources,

hw [p] , w [dp]i

h1i

= rm d(a, b) exp(cid:16)irmd+1

rm d(a, b) exp irmd+1

k

2 b  da + ihdp
k
2 b  da

a + ihp b(cid:17)

(2.9)

this functional integral is independent of the metric of md+1 and is formally a topological
invariant. it is related to the topological linking number of disjoint, closed contractible
hypersurfaces p and dp, which can be seen by explicitly performing the integral to
obtain [3, 5, 10]

where

is the standard expression for the signed linking number of two cycles. here s(p) is
a hypersurface spanned by the p-cycle p, and p is the (singular) derham current
d  p + 1-form [29] which is the delta-function supported poincare dual to the embedding
xp : p  md+1. it is closed, dp = 0, and locally it can be expressed as

p(x) = ip

(p,dp+1)(xp(), x) = ip

d(xp) (d+1)(xp(), x)

(2.12)

where

d1p(xp) = 1p

is the induced volume element of p in md+1 and (p,dp+1)(x, y) is the dirac delta-function
in the exterior algebra p(md+1(x))  dp+1(md+1(y)), i.e.

zmd+1(y)

(p,dp+1)(x, y)  (y) = (x)

(x)  p(md+1(x))

(2.14)

a more complete picture of this system is obtained by canonical quantization. for this,
we choose the spacetime to be the product manifold r1  md, where r1 parametrizes the
time t and md is a compact, path-connected, orientable d-dimensional manifold without
boundary.2 the eld b may then be decomposed according to

b = b0  dt + b

(2.15)

i1ip1 = bi1ip10 and b is
where b0 is the p  1-form on md with local components b0
the restriction of b to md (and similarly for the other elds of the theory). the action
is now written as

s(p, dp) =



z

dt zmd

  k

2

b  da + qp b  p + qdp a  dp!

(2.16)

where qp, qdp  r are worldvolume charges, p and dp are disjoint hypersurfaces
in md+1, and we use the local worldvolume reparametrization invariance to x the
gauge in which the temporal embedding coordinate parametrizes the hypersurface p,
p (1, . . . , p) = 1. the temporal components of the elds are lagrange multipliers
i.e. x 0
which enforce the local gauge constraints

k
2

d a + qp p  0

,

(1)p(dp) k
2

d b + qdp dp  0

(2.17)

the remaining action is of rst order in time derivatives and is therefore already expressed
in phase space with the spatial components of a and b being the canonically conjugate
variables. the canonical quantum commutator is

h ai1idp(x) , bj1jp(y)i =

2i
k

0i1idpj1jp (d)(x, y)

(2.18)

note that the factors of det g, where g is the metric of md, which would make the
delta-function on the right-hand side of (2.18) generally covariant cancel similar factors
coming from the totally antisymmetric tensor . the canonical commutator is therefore
independent of the metric of md. the hamiltonian in the temporal gauge a0 = b0 = 0
is

h =  zmd (cid:16)qdp a  0

p(cid:17)
dp + qp b  0

(2.19)

however, there is a technical problem with the way that we have set up the canonical
formalism for this topological eld theory. the diculty lies in the fact that the local
gauge constraints (2.17), which must be imposed as physical state conditions in the quan-
tum eld theory, imply that the forms a and b have non-vanishing ux around cycles of
the manifold md, i.e. generically we have h dp+1

d a 6= 0 and h p+1 d b 6= 0. this implies

2in the following greek indices  = 0, 1, . . . , d will label spacetime directions in md+1 while
latin indices i = 1, . . . , d label spatial directions in md. furthermore, explicit metric factors
required to make quantities dieomorphism invariant will be typically omitted.

that a and b cannot be considered as globally dened dierential forms and must be
dened locally on patches covering the manifold. in turn, the denition of the topolog-
ical eld theory must be appropriately modied. this will be the subject of the next
subsection. here we note only one nal aspect of this model in the absence of sources
(qp = qdp = 0). in that case the constraints (2.17) imply that a and b restricted to
md are closed forms. their worldvolume integrals are therefore topological invariants
and (2.18) implies that they obey the operator algebra

where

[ dp, p] = xx p dp

sgn(x)

(2.20)

(2.21)

is the signed intersection number of the embedded hypersurfaces dp and p on md
taken over all intersections x with orientation sgn(x) = 1 (generically, in d dimensions,
a p-surface and a d  p-surface intersect at discrete points). this number is a topological
invariant, so that if either dp or p is a contractible hypersurface, then [ dp, p]
vanishes and they intersect an even number of times with cancelling orientations. thus,
in (2.20), the commutator is non-trivial only for those worldvolumes which are non-trivial
elements of the p-th and dp-th homology groups hp(md) and hdp(md). this property
will be the crucial aspect of the topological group representations that we shall nd.

2.2. bf theory on non-trivial line bundles

we shall now consider the case where the elds a and b are sections of some non-
trivial bundle over the spacetime manifold md+1. since these sections have rank which
is in general larger than 1, they are actually sections of a higher-rank bundle [28] over
md+1, i.e. a ber bundle whose bers are groupoids, rather than some lie group. such
generalized ber bundles are known as gerbes. as pointed out in [25], in this case the
zero mode contribution to the path integral (2.6) is modied and the resulting topological
invariant represents not just the ray-singer torsion (2.8), but also the cech cohomology
of the underlying manifold. thus the canonical quantization of the bf eld theory in
this case will yield not only interesting quantum eld theoretical representations of the
derham complex of the spatial manifold md, but also of the more general cech complex
which encodes the possibility of passage from local to global data on md and which
classies the topological line bundles over md. gerbes have also been used recently for
some general analyses in quantum eld theory [30] and in the context of massive d-brane
congurations in type ii superstring theory [31].

we assume that the spatial manifold md admits a nite open leray cover u = {ua}.
for each ordered collection (ua0, ua1, . . . , uaq ) of open sets of u with non-empty intersec-

7

tion, we dene the support

ua0a1aq = ua0  ua1      uaq

(2.22)

along with a formal orientation dened by ua(0)a(1)a(q) = sgn() ua0a1aq for   sq+1.
the abelian group of all formal linear combinations with integer coecients of objects of
the form (2.22) is the q-chain group cq(u) of the cover u. using a z-linear boundary
operator  dened on q-chains by

ua0a1aq =

q

(1)k ua0a1ak1ak+1aq

xk=0

(2.23)

one may dene the q-th cech homology group hq(md) which is independent of the choice
of leray cover (if u is not a leray cover, then the homology must be dened by taking
an inductive limit over all possible open coverings of the space).

the cover u naturally denes a simplicial decomposition of the manifold md. namely,
to each elementary q-chain (2.22) we can naturally associate a q-simplex q. in dimension
d, we may label the simplices with a number of indices which is dual to their dimension,
by the inductive denition that a q-simplex (a1adq)
is obtained as the intersection of
d  q + 1 simplices of dimension q + 1,

q

(a1adq)

q

= (a1adq1)

q+1

 (adq1adqa1adq3)

q+1

 (adq3adq2adq1adqa1adq5)

q+1

     (a2adq)

q+1

(2.24)

along with the appropriate orientation induced by the supports of the cover u. with this
convention the boundary operator acts on a q-simplex as

dq+1

(a1adq)

q

= xa

xk=1

(1)k+1 (a1ak1aakadq)

q1

(2.25)

where the rst sum in (2.25) runs through all q  1-simplices with the appropriate index
labellings. in this way the cech homology of the manifold md coincides with its simplicial
homology (this is also true if md doesnt admit a leray cover).

on each open set ua of the covering u there is a (d  p)-form gauge eld a(a) and
a p-form gauge eld b(a), which are elements of the 0-cochain group c 0(u, dp) with
coecients in the sheaf dp of real-valued dierential d  p-forms on md and of the 0-
cochain group c 0(u, p) with coecients in the sheaf p of p-forms, respectively. there
are gauge transformations (ab)
dened on the non-empty intersection uab of
any two open sets by

,

b(a)  b(b) = d (ab)

(2.26)

1 = (ba)

with (ab)
. these local forms are elements of the 1-cochain
groups c 1(u, dp1) and c 1(u, p1), respectively. since each q is a ne sheaf, the cor-
responding cech cohomology is trivial, and so there are secondary gauge transformations

(2.27)

this procedure can be iterated inductively to higher degree cochains over higher degree
chains. namely, for each 1  q < d  p there are cochains (a0a1aq)
 c q(u, dpq) and
 c q(u, pq) which, on each non-trivial elementary
for each 1  q < p we have (a0a1aq)

the locally constant functions a0a1adp+1 and a0a1ap+1 are, respectively, d  p + 1-

of the manifold md with coecients in the constant sheaf r (again this is independent
of the choice of leray cover). these cech cohomology groups are naturally isomorphic to

responding uxes of the gauge elds a and b can be represented in terms of the cech
cohomology classes using the overlap relations (2.26)(2.31) and repeated application of

with respect to the induced simplicial decompositions of dp+1 and p+1, respectively,
from the restrictions of the cover u to these submanifolds of md (via a renement of u if
necessary). equations (2.34) and (2.35) demonstrate explicitly the relationship between
the cech and derham cohomologies.

now we come to the appropriate extension of the action (2.16) for the present situation.
for this, we shall compactify the time direction on a circle, so that md+1 = s1 md, and
extend the leray cover u with its corresponding simplicial decomposition of md trivially
through the time direction. this means that we shall consider only periodic motions on
the space md. since the gauge elds a and b are only locally dened on md+1, the
bf action must be modied so that it is independent of the simplicial decomposition (or
covering) used to dene the elds. consider the term

zmd+1

b  da = xa

z

(a)

b(a)  da

(2.36)

add the term pa,br(ab)

d

where the sum runs through all d + 1-simplices of md+1. if we deform the simplex (a)
d+1,
then the corresponding change of integrand in (2.36) is d((ab)
1  da), so that we must
1  da in order to cancel this variation. in turn, we must

(ab)

cancel the dependence of this additional term on deformations of the simplices (ab)
, and
so on. now we must repeat this procedure for the derham currents appearing in (2.16).
since p is a closed form representing the poincare cohomology class of the cycle p, by
poincares lemma we have

where the sums all run over the simplicial decomposition of the spacetime manifold md+1.
the brackets <    > in (2.40) act on the indices of a product of cochains by putting
them in increasing order with repeated indices matched according to their position in the
sequence (not their value) and then multiplying the cochain product by the parity of the
rearranging permutation, i.e. for   sd we have

x <(1p) y (pd)> = sgn() x (1p) y (pd)

(2.41)

it is straightforward to verify that the complicated expression (2.40) ensures that the total
action is independent of the simplicial decomposition of md+1 used to evaluate each of
the integrals. in this way, we arrive at a topologically invariant action for the bf eld
theory with gauge elds that are sections of a non-trivial u(1) bundle over the manifold.

the action (2.40) as it stands is dicult to deal with, especially for the quantum
eld theory. however, it can be simplied by noticing that the gauge eld a may be
decomposed in terms of an arbitrary globally-dened dierential form a  dp(md+1)
and a singular form a which is an explicit representative of the topological bundle of a
(and similarly for b). this latter degree of freedom may be constructed as follows. let
np be the rank of the singular homology groups hp(md) and hdp(md), and let (k)
p and
(k)

dp be sets of corresponding generators. the associated intersection matrix of md is

i (p)kl = i(l)

dp(x)

i(k)

p (y)

(dp,p)(x, y)

11

(2.42)

then the gauge eld a may be written as

a =

np1

xk=1

ak + a

where the singular forms ak are dened by

dak = (1)p(dp)

np1

xl=1

i (p1)
lk

f0( (l)

dp+1)  (k)

p1

(2.43)

(2.44)

and they ensure that a has the correct periods (2.34) around cycles of md. here i (p)
is
lk
the matrix inverse of the intersection matrix (2.42), and  denotes the derham current
which is poincare dual to a cycle in the spatial manifold md (for ease of notation the
tildes are suppressed on dirac delta-functions over md, as in (2.42)). this means that
we have chosen to localize the ux of the gauge elds over submanifolds of md, rather
than the full spacetime manifold md+1. this choice is a necessary requirement in the
canonical formalism, and is possible due to the topological triviality of the time direction
of md+1. similarly, the gauge eld b can be written as

b =

np+1

xk=1

bk + b

(2.45)

where b  p(md+1) is a globally-dened dierential form and bk are singular forms
dened by

d bk =

i (p+1)
lk h0( (l)

p+1)  (k)

dp1

(2.46)

np+1

xl=1

which ensure that b has the correct periods (2.35). finally, the derham currents are
written as

np1

p =

xk,l=1

i (p1)
lk

[ (l)

dp+1, p(0)]  (k)

p1

+ d p

(2.47)

with p  dp(md+1). here p(t) represents the embedded hypersurface xp(p) 
md+1 projected onto md with boundary the p  1-brane xp(t, 2, . . . , p) at time t, and
we have localized the period integrals of the derham currents onto a xed patch of md
at t = 0 (as with the uxes in (2.44) and (2.46)).

substituting the decompositions (2.43)(2.47) into the action (2.16) and integrating

by parts we have

the rst set of integrals in (2.48) are dened using the topological extension (2.40). re-
membering that the simplicial decomposition of md is extended trivially through the
periodic time direction of md+1, using the decompositions (2.43)(2.47) and some calcu-
lation we nd that the only non-vanishing contributions are

(2.49)

the contribution (2.49) is not a topological invariant because it now changes under defor-
mations of the simplices of md. using the period relations (2.34) and (2.35), we see that
the two sets of integrals in (2.49) are dened modulo terms of the form qdpf0 and qph0
(for periodic motions). in the quantum eld theory, such terms would then appear as
phases eissing and thus the ambiguity can be removed by a ux relation among the gauge
elds. the required consistency condition ensuring topological invariance of the quantum
eld theory is thus

in the following sections we will see that this condition does indeed lead to a sensible

features of the motion group on topologically non-trivial spaces.

the integration in (2.51) can be set to 0 via a judicious choice of decomposition of the
xed derham currents. this will be done in the next section. the essential feature
is that the derham currents are decomposed in (2.47) so that the only non-vanishing
period integrals come from cycles which lie entirely in the spatial manifold md. a similar
calculation shows that the fourth and fth lines of (2.48) can be taken to be 0 in the
temporal gauge. the nal result is the action

s(p, dp) = ssing +i dt zmd

  k

2

b  da + qdp a  dp + qp b  p! (2.52)

this form of the action, along with the constraint (2.50), will be used to construct the
canonical quantum eld theory in the following sections.

3. canonical quantization

having introduced the required modications of the topological eld theory that are
required over non-trivial bundles, we shall now proceed to study the structure of the phase
space of this system which will be used in the next section to construct the wavefunctions
of the canonical quantum eld theory.

3.1. hodge decompositions

to deal with the quantum eld theory associated with the action (2.52), it will be
convenient to exploit the fact that a and b are globally dened dierential forms on
md and therefore admit hodge decompositions [29]. in this way we may write the eld
degrees of freedom in terms of their local exact and co-exact components, and their
global components which take into account the topological degrees of freedom. for this,
we consider the intersection matrix i (p)kl of md whose matrix inverse can be dened by
the bilinear form

i (p)

kl = zmd

(p)
l  (p)

k

(3.1)

where {(p)
tively, which are orthonormal in the inner product

k=1 are bases of generators of h dp

l=1 and {(p)

k }np

l }np

d (md) and h p

d(md), respec-

zmd

(p)
l  (p)

k = zmd

(p)
l  (p)

k = lk

(3.2)

here  is the hodge duality operator on md with respect to the restriction of the spacetime
metric of md+1. with this denition, the harmonic forms (p)
are the (non-
singular) poincare duals of the corresponding homology generators (l)
p of the
free parts of the singular homology groups hdp(md) and hp(md), respectively (the

dp and (k)

and (p)
k

l

14

torsion components of the homology will play no role in what follows). the natural
bilinear pairing on derham cohomology between any closed d  p-form  and any closed
p-form  may then be written as

   =

zmd

np

xk,l=1


i(l)


dp




i (p)

lk 
i(k)


p




(3.3)

we shall denote by 2
p(md).

p = d  d the laplacian operator acting on co-closed p-forms in

the eld a may then be expressed in terms of its hodge decomposition over md as

a = d + dpk +

al(t) (p)

l

np

xl=1

(3.4)

where   dp1(md) and pk  p1(md) with

i (p)kl zmd

xk=1

al(t) =

,

2

p1pk = d a

a  (p)

k = i(l)

dp

a

(3.5)

since, by assumption, a is a globally dened dierential form on md, the form d a
contains no zero modes (harmonic forms) of the laplacian operator 2
p1. moreover, the
local and global parts of the gauge transformations (2.2) may be expressed in terms of
the above degrees of freedom as

   + 

,

al  al + 2nl

dp

(3.6)

where d is the local exact part of the closed d  p-form  and nl
dp labels the winding
numbers of the gauge eld a around the poincare dual homology basis element (l)
dp.
using the time-independent gauge transformations (3.6), we can remove the laplacian
zero modes of the form d  a. similarly, the hodge decomposition of the eld b over
md is

np

where p  dp1(md) and k  p1(md) with

b = dp + dk +

bl(t) (p)

l

xl=1

i (p)kl zmd

and the gauge transformations (2.3) may be written as

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

where d is the local exact part of the closed p-form .
modes of the dierential forms d b and d  b may be set to 0.

it follows that the harmonic

it will prove convenient to use a holomorphic polarization for the harmonic degrees of
freedom of the gauge elds. for this, we consider the 2np-dimensional symplectic vector
space

p = h p

d(md)  h dp

d (md)

(3.10)

which, according to the gauge constraints (2.17), is the reduced classical phase space of
the source-free bf eld theory and is spanned by the topological degrees of freedom al
and bk of the gauge elds. on this nite dimensional vector space we may introduce a
complex structure which is parametrized by an np np symmetric complex-valued matrix
 such that  lives in the siegal upper half-plane. its imaginary part denes a metric

glk = 2

np

xm,n=1

i (p)ml (im mn) i (p)nk

(3.11)

on the topological phase space p. note that the topological invariance property of the bf
eld theory implies that all observables will be independent of the phase space complex
structure. the desired holomorphic polarization is then dened by the complex variables

l = al +

np

xk,m=1

i (p)mlmk bk

l = al +

np

xk,m=1

(3.13)

now we come to the hodge decompositions for the non-singular parts of the derham

currents (2.47). we have

 d p = 0
where the p-form p may be decomposed as

p  dt + p

p = dp + dp +

np

xk,l=1

(p)
l (t) i (p)kl  (p)

k

(3.14)

(3.15)

with p  p1(md) and p  dp1(md). from the source continuity equation d2p =
0 we have

in arriving at the second equality in (3.18) we have used poincare-hodge duality and the
local form (2.12) of the derham current. again the globally dened dierential form dp
contains no zero modes of the laplacian operator 2
dp1, and the continuity equation
(3.16) implies the current gauge symmetry

p  p + 

(3.19)

with  an arbitrary d  p  1-form, which allows one to remove the harmonic components
of d  p.

finally, we shall write the hodge decompositions (3.15) of the derham currents in
terms of a generalized eigenfunction expansion on md. for this, we introduce, for each
p, a basis of co-exact p-forms (p)
p which constitute the complete system of eigenstates of
the laplacian operator 2

p with eigenvalues 2

p  0:

 d  (p)

p = 0

2

p = d  d(p)

p = 2

and which are orthonormal:

dp1 , and so it suces to consider
p are just the

because of hodge duality, we may identify (p)
only [ d
harmonic p-forms, (p)

0 = {(p)

k }np
k=1.

these eigenstates are particularly useful for expanding the dirac delta-functions which
act on the exterior algebras of md in terms of completeness relations. for example, we
can readily write down the following distribution-valued hodge decompositions over the
appropriate exterior algebras:

(d)(x, y) = x0

(0)
0 (x) (0)

0 (y)

(dp,p)(x, y) =  xdp16=0
+ xdp6=0

dp (x)  (dp)

dp (y) +

np

xk,l=1

(p)
l (x)  i (p)kl (p)

k (y)

(3.22)

then, by equating the exact and co-exact parts of (dp,p)(x, y) in (3.22) with those of dp
in (3.15), we arrive the following generalized eigenfunction expansions for the components
of the derham currents:

(p1)

(3.23)

where we have used (3.16), (3.18), (2.12), and hodge duality. note that with the decom-
position of 0
p in (3.23), the integral (2.51) vanishes because it yields the intersection
number of the projected hypersurface p(t) with the time direction of md+1, which is 0.

3.2. canonical structure

we shall now proceed to describe the canonical quantization of the eld theory. first
we examine the local gauge constraints (2.17). upon substitution of the decompositions
(2.43), (2.44) and (2.47), we may integrate the multi-valued part of (2.17) over a suitable
cycle of md and obtain the relation

f0( (l)

dp+1) = 

2
k

qp [ (l)

dp+1, p(0)]

(3.24)

note that this relation is a strong equality since neither the ux f0 nor the charge qp
will be a dynamical degree of freedom. the remaining non-singular part of (2.17) can be
expressed in terms of the decompositions (3.5) and (3.14) to give the weak equality

(1)(d1)(p1) k
2

2

p1pk + qp 0

p  0

(3.25)

similarly, from the local gauge constraints associated with the b eld in (2.17) we obtain,
using (2.45) and (2.46), the strong equality

h0( (l)

p+1) = (1)p(dp) 2
k

qdp [ (l)

p+1, dp(0)]

(3.26)

and from (3.8) the weak equality

 (1)d k
2

2

dp1p + qdp

0
dp  0

(3.27)

using the strong equalities (3.24) and (3.26), we can now rewrite the consistency condition
(2.50) in the form

1 =

qp qdp [ (m)

p+1, dp(0)] [ (l)

(cid:17)

(3.28)
the constraint (3.28) is a topological quantization condition determined by the inter-
section numbers of the homology cycles of md. it is the appropriate generalization to
the present case of the usual dirac charge quantization condition. the global gauge
constraints of the bf eld theory will be described in the next section.

having described the gauge constraints of the model, we may now write down the
canonical quantum commutators. for this, we need to examine the source-free bf ac-
tion in (2.52). using the hodge decompositions of the previous subsection we may write

18

down explicitly the remaining bf action without the gauge constraints (i.e. in the tem-
poral gauge a0 = b0 = 0). after some algebra and integrations by parts over md it is
straightforward to arrive at

s = i dt

(3.29)
where gkl is the matrix inverse of the topological phase space metric (3.11). from the
action (3.29) we can immediately read o the non-vanishing canonical poisson brackets

nk(x) , pk(y)o =

where (p) : p(md)  p(md) is the symmetric, transverse orthogonal projection onto
the subalgebra of co-closed p-forms of p(md), and (2
p) denotes the laplacian operator
2

p with its zero modes arising from gauge invariance removed.

in the quantum eld theory, poisson brackets are mapped onto quantum commuta-
tors according to the correspondence principle. in the functional schrodinger picture, we
may treat the elds , k and k as coordinates on the (innite dimensional) cong-
uration space [17]. then the canonical commutation relations corresponding to (3.30)
are represented by writing the canonical momentum dierential forms as the derivative
operators

as we shall see, the projection operators in (3.31) have the eect of ensuring the invari-
ance of the physical state wavefunctions under the time-independent secondary gauge
symmetries

   + d

,

k  k + d

(3.32)

these symmetries are a consequence of the feature that the topological gauge theory has
rst-stage, o-shell reducible gauge symmetries [3, 10], and they can be regarded, through
the minimal couplings of the gauge elds to the derham currents, as being dual to the
current symmetries (3.19).

19

finally, we can express the hamiltonian (2.19) as well in terms of the various hodge
decompositions of the previous subsection. using the fact that the singular parts of the
derham currents make no contributions, after some algebra and integrations by parts we
arrive at the classical hamiltonian

3.3. global phase space

we close this section by comparing the present canonical approach to the path integral
formalism used in [25] for the quantization of abelian bf theory dened over non-trivial
line bundles. in the former approach, the zero mode vector space (3.10) comes from the
single-valued parts of the gauge elds and would yield the same overall volume factor in
the path integral measure as that for the quantum eld theory dened on a trivial vector
bundle. the sum over all line bundles localizes onto the topological class determined by
the external charges qp and qdp through the ux relationships (3.24) and (3.26). the
non-triviality of the bundle is then encoded in the strong gauge constraints (3.28) which
will be imposed on the wavefunctions in the next section. the topological sum may then
be taken over all quantized charges obeying (3.28). in the latter approach, the sum over
non-trivial line bundles is explicitly carried out in the source-free path integral and is

20

shown to modify the (ungraded) space of harmonic zero modes to

p = mn=p,dp(cid:16)h n

c(md, z) / h n1

c (md, r/z)(cid:17) (cid:16)h dn

c (md, r/z)  h dn

d (md)(cid:17) (3.35)

here the cech cohomology group h dp
c (md, r/z) classies the higher-rank bundles of
degree d  p which admit at d  p-form connections (equivalently constant transition
functions), while the quotient cohomology in (3.35) classies the higher-rank bundles
of degree d  p modulo those with constant transition functions. thus, although the
functional integration reproduces the usual ray-singer invariant, the overall volume factor
is now modied to take into account of the non-trivial cech cohomology. in the following
we shall see how this cohomology is represented explicitly by the wavefunctions of the
canonical quantum eld theory.

4. construction of the physical states

in this section we shall use the canonical formalism for the quantum eld theory
developed in the previous section to explicitly solve for the physical state wavefunctions
of bf theory. from the form of the hamiltonian operator (3.34) we see that they may be
separated into two pieces l and t representing the local and global topological parts
in the corresponding decomposition of the bf eld theory:

phys[, k, ; t] = l[, k; t] t (; t)

(4.1)

we shall see that each component in (4.1) plays an important role in the topological group
representations that we will nd in the next section.

4.1. local gauge symmetries

the local components of the full wavefunction must satisfy the weak equalities (3.25)
and (3.27) which are imposed as physical state conditions in the quantum eld theory and
which truncate the full hilbert space onto the physical, gauge invariant subspace. using
the functional schrodinger representations in (3.31), we thereby arrive at the quantum
equations which express the local gauge constraints of the theory:

"(1)(d1)(p1) i (p1) 
"(1)d i (dp1) 



k

+ qp 0

p# l[, k; t] = 0
dp# l[, k; t] = 0
0

+ qdp

they are solved by wavefunctionals of the form

(4.2)

l(t)

(4.3)

dp(cid:17)


l[, k; t] = exp
i zmd (cid:16)(1)(d1)(p1) qp k  0


p  (1)d qdp   0

21

which yield a projective representation of the local gauge symmetries in terms of a non-
trivial, local u(1)  u(1) one-cocycle:

phys[ + , k + , ; t]

= exp


i zmd (cid:16)(1)(d1)(p1) qp   0

p  (1)d qdp   0

dp(cid:17)


phys[, k, ; t]

(4.4)

note that the wavefunction (4.3) can be written in a more explicit form using the decom-
positions (2.47) of the derham currents.

4.2. schrodinger wave equation

to determine the remaining part l(t) of the wavefunction (4.3), we solve the corre-

sponding schrodinger wave equation

phys[, k, ; t] = hphys[, k, ; t]

is the d  1-dimensional solid angle. note that the above derivation can be carried out
in the same way to obtain a nal expression which is explicitly symmetric in dp(t) and
p(t), and which thereby exhibits the manifest (hodge) duality symmetry between the
two hypersurfaces. however, in order to keep the formulas from getting overly lengthy,
we do not exhibit this symmetrization explicitly.

let us examine the dependence of the function (4.9) on the topological classes of the

projected hypersurfaces. for this, we x the p1-brane embedding function xp(t, 2, . . . , p)
and choose another hypersurface 

change in the second term in (4.9):

p(t) in the same topological class as p(t), i.e. p(t) 
p(t) = sp(t) for some p + 1-volume sp(t). it is then straightforward to compute the

(4.11)

where we have used stokes theorem, and sp(t) is a local coordinate system on sp(t). this
shows that if we continuously deform p(t) in md, then, modulo the harmonic forms
in (4.11), the second term in (4.9) does not change unless the deformation crosses the
d  p  1-brane at xdp(t, 2, . . . , dp).
in that case the change is then d1, which
is cancelled by the delta-function term in (4.9). as for the harmonic part of (4.11), we
symmetrize the expression (4.8) in p(t) and dp(t) to obtain a manifestly hodge duality
symmetric function. then the harmonic term in (4.11) becomes

(4.12)

using the bilinear identity (3.3), we see that the change (4.12) will contribute a phase
factor to (4.8) which is simply unity due to the topological phase constraint (3.28) (applied
to each time slice of md+1). the condition (3.28) thereby represents a fundamental
global constraint that must be satised by the external charges qp, qdp for a consistent
(topologically invariant) solution of the bf quantum eld theory. we shall see later on
that this imposes a corresponding global constraint that must be met by all consistent
well-dened representations of the motion group on topologically non-trivial manifolds
md.

the function p(t) therefore depends only on the topological classes of the trajectories
p(t) and dp(t) in md, and not on their particular representatives, provided that they
do not intersect. the above argument also shows that if dp(t) is kept constant in
time t while p(t) sweeps out a closed hypersurface in a given time span, then the only
contribution to p(t) is from the second term in (4.9) which gives d1. furthermore, if
p(t) is xed and dp(t) sweeps out a closed hypervolume in a given time span, then
the second term in (4.9) is invariant while the rst term counts exactly the number
of times the hypersurface dp(t) links p(t), giving a contribution of d1 each time.
thus, p(t) gives the d-dimensional relative solid angle between p(t) and dp(t) in
adiabatic linking processes in md. it is the generalized, adiabatic linking function that
will yield the appropriate holonomy phase changes in the wavefunctions for the motion
group representations that we will obtain in the following. furthermore, for innitesimal
paths it is readily seen that (4.9) reduces to the usual solid angle function on md = rd.
we will describe the transformation properties of the wavefunctions under homologically
non-trivial motions of the hypersurfaces p(t) and dp(t) later on.

we now come to the remaining, topological part of the schrodinger equation (4.5) for
the global harmonic degrees of freedom of the gauge elds. from (3.34) it follows that

(4.15)

the function 0 may be xed by requiring that the wavefunctions respect the large gauge
transformations of the elds which are not connected to the identity in the topological
phase space (3.10). this will be done in the next subsection.

4.3. global gauge symmetries

for a consistent quantum theory, we must demand that, when there are no sources
present (qp = qdp = 0), the wavefunctions 0 coincide with the cohomological states
that represent the invariance of the quantum eld theory under large gauge transforma-
tions.
in this case, the local gauge constraints (4.2) imply that the full physical state
wavefunctions depend only on the global harmonic degrees of freedom l. furthermore,
the hamiltonian then vanishes (since the pure source-free bf eld theory is topological)
so that the states are also time-independent. this means that in the absence of any
sources the wavefunctions carry information only about the topology of the manifold md.

to construct these states, we consider the classical translation operators which gener-

ate the appropriate shifts (3.13) of the holomorphic gauge degrees of freedom:

c(np, ndp) =

(4.16)

using the schrodinger representation (3.31) we can then write down the corresponding
quantum operators which implement the global gauge symmetries:

(4.17)

for the remainder of this paper we will assume that the coecient k of the pure bf
action is of the form

k = i (p) k1
k2

(4.18)

where i (p) > 0 is the integer-valued determinant of the intersection matrix i (p)lm and
k1, k2 are positive integers with gcd(i (p)k1, k2) = 1.

in contrast to the classical operators (4.16), the operators u(np, ndp) do not commute
with each other. using the baker-campbell-hausdor formula it is straightforward to
compute that these operators generate the global u(1)  u(1) two-cocycle algebra:

u(np, ndp)u(mp, mdp) = 
yl,r=1

e2ik(1)p(dp)i (p)

lr (ml

 u(mp, mdp)u(np, ndp)

(4.20)

on the other hand, the cocycle algebra (4.19) implies that the operators u(k2np, k2ndp)
commute with all of the other gauge transformation generators, so that they lie in the
center of the global u(1)  u(1) gauge group and their action on the hilbert space is
represented simply as multiplication by some phases ei(np,ndp). this then implies the

where al, bl  [0, 1] and  is some lattice. the functions (4.23) are well-dened and
holomorphic in z  crank() when the lattice quadratic form  is an element of the
siegal upper half-plane.

in the present case, the lattice  is taken to be the torsion-free part of the inte-
ger cech cohomology group h p
c(md, z), and the corresponding dual lattice  that of
h dp
c (md, z), of rank np. then the standard double semi-periodicity properties of the
jacobi theta-functions [22, 32] provides the unique solution (4.22) of the quasi-periodicity
constraints (4.21). the wavefunctions (4.22) are orthogonal in the canonical coherent
state measure on the reduced topological phase space p/   which leads to the inner
product:

where we have implicitly divided out by the volume of the global gauge group used to
dene the complex np-torus p/   (as a consequence of the large gauge invariances).
the states (4.22) thereby provide a complete, orthonormal basis of the full physical hilbert
space, and they are well-dened functions on p/  . furthermore, under a large gauge

generate a (k2)np-dimensional projective representation of the group    of large gauge
transformations. here the projective phases are non-trivial global u(1)u(1) one-cocycles
which are cyclic with period k2. the topological part of the full wavefunction thereby
carries a non-trivial multi-dimensional projective representation of the discrete gauge
group representing the windings of the bf gauge elds around the appropriate non-trivial
homology cycles of md. this symmetry partitions the hilbert space into superselection
sectors labelled by the integer ( cech) cohomology classes of the spatial manifold.

the wavefunctions (4.22) possess some noteworthy modular transformation properties.
the automorphism group of the reduced topological phase space p/ with its complex
structure  and associated metric g is sp(2np, z). it acts on the geometrical parameters
as

 = (c + d)1  
  = (a + b)(c + d)1
g = (c + d)1  g (c + d)1

(4.27)

functions (4.23) is given by [32]

where (cid:16) a b
c d(cid:17)  sp(2np, z). the corresponding transformation of the jacobi theta-
 a
b!(|   ) = eiqdet(c + d) ei(c +d)1  a

b!(|   )

(4.28)

where  is an irrelevant phase and

a = da  cb  1

2 (cd)diag

,

b = ba + ab  1

2 (ab)diag

(4.29)

it follows that a modular invariant set of wavefunctions exists only when the quantity
i (p)k1k2 is an even integer, in which case we set al = bl = 0 (and also  = 0). otherwise,
we may take al, bl  {0, 1
2}, which corresponds to a choice of spin structure on the complex
np-torus which is the reduced topological phase space. the totality of wavefunctions
labelled by the al, bl then increases by 4np, and they now transform non-trivially under
modular transformations representing their transformation properties under a change in
choice of spin structure. these latter choices of al, bl are the only ones for which the
reection symmetry    closes on the set of wavefunctions (4.22) [22]. in this way,
the physical states turn out to be eectively independent of the phase space complex
structure, as required by the topological nature of the quantum eld theory.

5. representations of motion groups

where ql = 1, . . . , i (p)k1k2, l = 1, . . . , np, the bf coecient k is given by (4.18), and
the harmonic parts of the source degrees of freedom (p)
l (t) are determined by the period
integrals (3.18) of the corresponding harmonic forms over the trajectories p(t). the
external charge parameters in (5.1) are in addition constrained by the topological quanti-
zation condition (3.28). in this section we will study various aspects of the transformation
properties of the physical states (5.1) in connection with the representation theory of the
associated motion group. to set the stage for this, we begin by describing some general
aspects of motion groups.

5.1. the dahm motion group

the dahm motion group [13, 14] of a compact subspace   md is the group of
essentially dierent ways of continuously propagating  in md so that at the end of
the motion,  returns to its original conguration in md. this topological structure
generalizes the artin braid group [11], whereby a braid is viewed as a continuous one-

29

parameter family of trajectories of n distinct points in the plane, where at each time t0, the
conguration is given by the intersection of the braid at height z = t0. thus, the motion
group has its origins in the artin braid group, and therefore the present topological eld
theory yields the appropriate generalization of fractional statistics of (extended) objects
to any dimension. these applications will be discussed in the next section.

let us start by recalling the denition of the braid group bn (m2) of a connected
riemann surface m2 of genus g. it can be constructed as the fundamental group of the
quantum mechanical conguration space qn (m2) for the motion of n identical particles
on m2 with a hard-core repulsive interaction between them:

qn (m2) = (mn

2  n )/sn

(5.2)

where n = {(x, x, . . . , x) | x  m2} is the diagonal subspace of mn
2 be
some conguration of n points in m2. a motion of ~z in m2 is a loop ~z(t)  qn (m2),
t  [0, 1], based at ~z. the group of motions of ~z in m2 is then dened as the fundamental
homotopy group 1(qn (m2); ~z) of loops in qn (m2) based at ~z. since the conguration
space (5.2) is a connected manifold (0(qn (m2)) = 0), one may prove that

2 . let ~z  mn

1(qn (m2); ~z) = bn (m2)

(5.3)

the generators of bn (m2) are given by the operators n, n = 1, . . . , n  1, which braid
the trajectories of particles n and n + 1, along with the usual presentation of the artin
braid group of the plane m2 = r2 [11]. in addition, there are 2g generators associated
with carrying a particle trajectory around each homology generator of m2 [12].

it is precisely this homotopy denition of the braid group that generalizes and gives
the general notion of a motion group, whereby we replace the riemann surface m2 with
an arbitrary d-manifold md and the collection ~z of n points in m2 by any compact
subspace   md. we then dene a motion f of  in md to be a path ft, t  [0, 1], of
homeomorphisms of md with compact support such that f0 = 11md and f1() = . a
stationary motion of  in md is a motion f for which ft() =  t  [0, 1]. the product
f  g of two motions is the path

(f  g)t = 


g2t
2 )  g1

f2(t 1

,

,

0  t  1

(5.4)

while the inverse f 1 of a motion f is the path f1t  f 1
1 . we say that two motions f, g of
 in md are equivalent, f  g, if f 1g is homotopic to a stationary motion. in particular,
stationary motions are equivalent to the trivial motion ft = i t  [0, 1], where i :
  md is the canonical inclusion. it may then be shown that the corresponding set
of equivalence classes of motions of  in md, with the multiplication induced by that in
(5.4), forms a group m(md) which is called the dahm motion group of  in md [13, 14].

30

to understand what this group represents in terms of conguration space homotopy,
let e(md, ) denote the space of embeddings of  in md and h(md) the space of home-
omorphisms of md of compact support, both equipped with the compact-open topology.
let h(md, )  h(md) be the subspace of homeomorphisms which leave  xed. note
that both h(md) and h(md, ) are topological groups, so that one may dene the fun-
damental relative homotopy group 1(h(md), h(md, ); 11md) as the set of homotopy
classes of paths in h(md) which begin at 11md  h(md, ) and end in h(md, ), and
with multiplication induced by that of h(md). then by denition it follows that

m(md) = 1(h(md) , h(md, ) ; 11md)

(5.5)

note that the analog of the quantum conguration space (5.2) in the situation at hand
is the quotient space e(md, )/ , where f  f  if f () = f (), but the topology of
this space is unmanageable. however, it is straightforward to show [14] that if f, g are
motions of  in md, then f  g if and only if f is homotopic to a motion f  of  in md
with f 
t() = gt() t  [0, 1]. with this property, it is evident that the above denition
of a motion concides with the notion of a loop in a quantum conguration space.

let us now consider some basic examples of motion groups. first, we note that any
k-isotopy of n distinct points in a manifold md extends to a k-isotopy of all of md. from
this fact one may prove that, if pn = {x1, . . . , xn }  md is a collection of n distinct
points of md, then the restriction map

(h(md) , h(md, pn ) , 11md)

 (e(md, pn ) , e(pn , pn ) , 11pn )

(5.6)

induces isomorphisms

 : n(h(md) , h(md, pn ) ; 11md)  n(e(md, pn ) , e(pn , pn ) ; 11pn )

(5.7)

for all n  0 [14]. it follows that the group of motions of a point x  md coincides with
the fundamental group

and, if md is connected, the motion group of pn is the braid group

mx(md) = 1(md, x)

notice that, if dim md > 2, then [13]

mpn (md) = bn (md)

mpn (md) =

n

mn=1

1(md; xn)

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

from which it follows that the braiding phenomenon disappears in manifolds of dimension
larger than 2. a more interesting example is provided by the dahm group of motions
of n unlinked and unknotted circles in r3. the generators are the motions which ip a
circle, exchange two circles, and move one circle through another [14]. we shall return to

31

this example in the next section. for a description of the dahm group of a certain class
of non-trivial links in s3, see [33].

the present bf eld theory approach that we are ultimately interested in actually
focuses on two disjoint, compact submanifolds  = p(0) and  = dp(0) which
lead to motions p(t) and dp(t) of dual dimension in md. for this, we need a slight
generalization of the dahm motion group above [14]. let h(md, , ) be the subspace
of h(md) of homeomorphisms which leave xed both of the submanifolds  and . then
the motion group of the pair (, ) in md is dened to be the relative fundamental
homotopy group:

m,(md) = 1(h(md) , h(md, , ) ; 11md)

(5.11)

note that this denition diers from that of (5.5) with  replaced by   , since this
latter group uses motions of  and  which return to their original value only modulo
permutation of the two subspaces , . the former group, on the other hand, is the
one that is required when the statistics of the branes corresponding to ,  are non-
identical, as is the case in the canonical formulation of bf eld theory which utilizes
brane source couplings to two independent gauge elds. in fact, the relation between the
motion group (5.11) and the dahm groups (5.5) is given by the following theorem [14].
let  : m(md  )  m,(md) be the group homomorphism induced by the map

(h(md  ) , h(md  , ) , 11md)  (h(md) , h(md, , ) , 11md)

(5.12)

which sends each homeomorphism f  h(md  ) to its extension (f )  h(md) with
(f )| = 11. let  : m,(md)  m(md) be the group homomorphism induced by
the map

(h(md) , h(md, , ) , 11md)  (h(md) , h(md, ) , 11md)

(5.13)

which sends each f  h(md, , ) to f  h(md, ). then the sequence of groups

m(md  )

 m,(md)  m(md)

(5.14)

is exact.

we close this subsection with a nal useful computational property of the dahm
motion groups. namely, there is a map, called the dahm homomorphism [13, 14], which
is a homomorphism

d : m(md)  aut(1(md  ))

(5.15)

from the group of motions of  in md to the automorphism group of 1(md  ) induced
at the end of a given motion. this yields another presentation of the motion group which
may be thought of as the fundamental homotopy group of an appropriate quantum cong-
uration space. for some other computational aspects of the motion groups, see [14]. in the
following we will derive a class of representations of the motion group m,(md) which

32

illustrates some new general aspects of these topological groups, and thereby extends the
generally unprobed theory of motion groups. this will present a highly non-trivial ap-
plication and thereby demonstrate the usefulness of the present topological eld theory
approach.

5.2. abelian holonomy representations

let us now examine the various transformation properties of the wavefunctions (5.1)
and describe the ensuing representations of the motion group. consider an adiabatic
motion of the hypersurface p(t) about dp(t). first we consider the homologically
trivial motions.
if one of the hypersurfaces p(t) or dp(t) traces out a contractible
volume as it moves, then the topological current integrals in the full wavefunction (5.1)
vanish (c.f. eq. (3.18)). these currents therefore contribute nothing to the physical states
under these types of motions. the solid angle function p(t)  p(0), on the other hand,
has delta-function singularities and thereby contributes whenever the hypersurfaces link
each other. the change in p whenever such a linking occurs is d1, but this function is
nevertheless independent of the choice of representative of the topological classes of the
source trajectories, as shown in section 4.2. thus under such an adiabatical linking, the
wavefunctions (5.1) acquire the phase

(p)2 = e 2i

k (1)p(dp)qpqdp

(5.16)

now let us examine the case of a homologically non-trivial motion. consider the source
motion whereby p(t) is xed in time and dp(t) winds wdp
times, in a time span t0,
around the l-th homology d  p-cycle of md, and then afterwards dp(t) is xed and
p(t) winds wp
l times, up to some time t > t0, around the l-th homology p-th cycle of
md. according to (3.18), this motion can be summarized by the following equations:

l

(5.17)

the holonomies arising from possible linkings of these motions are taken into account by
the solid angle function and constitute the phase operators (5.16) for the motion group.
the remaining part of the periodic motion is readily found to change the wavefunctions
(5.1) according to

(q)

(5.20)

which may be viewed as dual to the algebra (4.19) of the winding translation generators,
in that the integers k1 and k2 are interchanged and the intersection matrix i (p)
lm is replaced
by its inverse through the combination qpqdpi (p)ml (the appearence of the charges here
owes to the fact that the algebra (5.20) comes from the windings of the sources, whereas
the algebra (4.19) comes about from the windings of the gauge elds themselves).

to describe the appropriate motion group representation, we dene wp(l)

k = l

k and

introduce the unitary operators

(l)
p = m(wp(l), 0)

,

(m)
p = m(0, wdp(m))

(5.21)

for each l, m = 1, . . . , np. then, together with the phase operators p11(k1)np , these
operators generate the following (k1)np dimensional representation of the pertinent motion
group:

p

h(l)
p , (m)
hp , (l)
(l)

i = 0
p i = 0
(m)
p (l)
p

p

(5.22)

(5.23)

(5.24)

and, according to (3.28), the topology of the manifold md imposes the following global
constraint on these generators:

1 =

yr,l=1

np+1

ym,n=1(cid:16)p(cid:17)2[ (m)

mn +i (p1)

rl

(cid:17)

(5.25)

p , (m)

the collection of 2np + 1 unitary operators {p, (l)
p } with the relations (5.22)(5.25)
constitute a subset of the full set of generators of a (k1)np dimensional representation
of the motion group mp(0),dp(0)(md). presumably there are more generators and
relations for this group (see the next section), but due to the abelian nature of the present
formalism such operators are represented trivially on the physical hilbert space of the bf
eld theory. notice that the constraint (5.25) is represented in terms of the intersection
matrices i (p1) and i (p+1) = i (dp1) (by poincare-hodge duality) which arise from the

34

initial p  1-brane and d  p  1-brane congurations p(0) and dp(0) used to dene
the appropriate motion group (and which come about from the relevant cech cohomology
groups).

the global constraint (5.25) comes about from the fact that there is always a trajectory
p(t) which encircles dp(t) and traces the homology generators of md in such a way
that it forms a trivial motion, i.e. one that is equivalent to a stationary motion of p(0)
in md. as a simple example of this constraint, consider the motion in md whereby,
initially at time t = 0, the p  1-brane intersects only with the l0-th homology d  p + 1-
cycle of md exactly once, and likewise for the d  p  1-brane with the m0-th homology
p + 1-cycle. then the global restriction (5.25) simplies to the form

(cid:16)p(cid:17)2pn i (p+1)

m0n +2pr i (p1)

rl0 = 1

(5.26)

p

p , (m)

this relation is a fundamental constraint that must be met the external charges qp, qdp
of the quantum eld theory in order to yield a well-dened motion group representation.
generally, the relations (5.22)(5.24) between the linking operator p and the generators of
homologically non-trivial motions (l)
reect the non-trivial relationships that exist
between motions around the various cycles of md. the relation (5.24) is very natural,
since it tells us that the operations of moving p and dp around the pertinent cycles
commute only when these cycles do not intersect. otherwise, they dier by a holonomy
factor that depends precisely on the intersection number of the cycles and represents
the number of linking operations required to unravel the motion to a stationary one.
together with the exact sequence (5.14), these relationships may determine at least a
large portion of the full motion group for a wide class of submanifold embeddings in terms
of their individual motions in md. these relationships thereby reect a highly non-trivial
application of the present topological eld theory to the theory of motion groups. in the
next section we shall describe briey how the present model may be modied so as to
potentially produce the full set of generators and motions of mp(0),dp(0)(md).

6. applications

in this nal section we will briey describe some examples and applications of the
formalism above. we will also mention possible generalizations which could probe deeper
into the structure of motion groups on topologically non-trivial manifolds.

6.1. the braid group

for our rst example, we illustrate how the well-known holonomy representations of
the braid group [17][19] appear within our more general formalism. we set d = 2, p = 1
and n1 = 2g, where g is the genus of a compact riemann surface m2. for any g > 0,

35

we may view m2 as the connected sum (t2)#g of two-tori and hence as an embedded
submanifold of r3. the canonical basis of h1(m2, z) = z2g is dened by the 2g generators
al and bm, l, m = 1, . . . , g, where al corresponds to the class of the outer cycle of t2 in
the l-th component of the connected sum (t2)#g while bm corresponds to the class of the
inner cycle of t2 in the m-th component. the intersection indices of these one-cycles are
given by

[al, ak] = [bl, bk] = 0
[al, bk] = [bk, al] = l
k

and the corresponding intersection matrix is

i (1)kl = (cid:18) 0

11g

11g

0 (cid:19)

(6.1)

(6.2)

with k, l = 1, . . . , 2g. furthermore, we have i (0) = i (2) = 1, where the sign is chosen
with respect to a given orientation of the surface m2 when viewed as an embedded
submanifold of r3.

in the present case, we denote the generators (l)
1

1 ) by l for l = 1, . . . , g and
by m=2g+1l for l = g + 1, . . . , 2g. the operator which represents the braiding of the
trajectories of two particles of charges q1 and q2 is

(and (l)

 = e

i
k q1q2

(6.3)

then, according to the relations (5.22)(5.24), these operators have the following presen-
tation which represents various equivalent braids:

h , li = h , li = 0
hl , mi = hl , mi = 0
hl , mi = 0

for l 6= m

l l = 2 l l

(6.4)

for each l, m = 1, . . . , g. however, the global constraint (5.25) for this particular braid
group representation is an identity. the topology of the riemann surface m2 in the
present case does not aect the linking operator , because the bf eld theory representa-
tion in eect generates an abelian holonomy representation of the unpermuted braid group
of m2, i.e. that associated with the quantum mechanical conguration space of a system
of non-identical particles. for a system of n identical particles, the corresponding braid
group representation would have to satisfy the additional global constraint 2(n +g1) = 1
for a closed manifold [12, 19]. normally, such a constraint would come geometrically in
part from a framing of the corresponding three-dimensional manifold which is required
to regulate the self-linkings of the particle trajectories [34]. here the linking numbers
induced by the bf eld theory contain no such ambiguous self-linking terms. in eect,

36

the present holonomy factors induce a representation of the two colour braid group [35]
generated by exchanging ribbon-like congurations. the ribbons can themselves twist,
leading to intrinsic spin phases which cancel exactly with the statistical exchange phases
as a result of the spin-statistics theorem (this may be checked explicitly by computing
the action of the energy-momentum tensor on the physical states (5.1)). note that the
argument of the solid angle function (4.9) denes an eigenfunction expansion of the prime
form of the riemann surface m2 which in turn produces the appropriate generalization
of the usual multi-valued angle function of the plane [17][19].

6.2. quantum exchange statistics of extended objects

worldvolumes to be disjoint unions p = `n

the generic properties of the braid group representations described above can be
generalized to any spatial manifold md of even dimension d = 2p. this in turn provides
a eld theoretical model which generalizes the phenomenon of fractional statistics of
quantum mechanical point particles in two dimensions to that of non-identical p1-branes
in 2p-dimensions (strings in four spatial dimensions, membranes in six spatial dimensions,
etc.). note that to describe a system of n > 2 non-interacting objects, one considers the
n=1 (n)
p and writes the corresponding derham
current of p as a sum over those of the (n)
p . in the present case, we again have that
i (p1) = i (p+1) (by poincare-hodge duality) and so the global constraint (5.25) again
simplies considerably. in particular, if the initial congurations at time t = 0 of both
p  1-branes intersect the homology p + 1-cycles of m2p in the same way, then this global
constraint is once again an identity and there are no further constraints on the linking
operators p of the holonomical motion group representation. this feature again owes to
the fact that we obtain a representation of the unpermuted, two-colour motion group. as
in the case of particles, we attribute this global cancellation as being due to an induced
spin of the extended motions which cancels the holonomy factors. in particular, we may
deduce from this cancellation that the standard spin-statistics theorem holds for such
congurations of extended objects (in contrast to the generic case [20]).

in the special case where the spatial manifold is at innite euclidean space md = rd,
the constructions of the previous sections can be made somewhat more explicit (essentially
because there are no harmonic zero modes in this case). in particular, it is known [14]
that in this case the motion groups count the connected components of the space of
orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of rd which preserve ,

m(rd) = 0(h+(rd, ))

(6.5)

furthermore, the euclidean greens function of the scalar laplacian for p > 1 is given by

y(cid:17) = 

1

2p1|x  y|2(p1)

(6.6)

(cid:16)x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

then, using (2.12), (3.17) and (4.6), we arrive at an explicit expression for the (sym-
metrized) 2p  1-dimensional solid angle formed between two p  1-brane congurations

(6.7)

the present topological eld theory formalism therefore produces very explicit higher-
dimensional generalizations of the standard multi-valued angle functions which have been
extensively studied and utilized in the physics of planar systems [17][19]. eq.
(6.7)
generalizes the standard expression for the adiabatic limit of the gauss linking number in
three-dimensions for two curves (p = 1) [34]. in this way the function (6.7) may in fact
be thought of as giving the appropriate higher-rank generalization of the electromagnetic
faraday law, but in a way that avoids the cumbersome self-linking number terms that
arise in the standard two dimensional formulations [17][19],[34].

6.3. quantum exchange statistics in odd dimensions

fractional statistics of identical extended objects in odd dimensional spaces may be
attained by modifying the topological class of one of the derham currents appearing in
the source-coupled bf action. an important example is the case of the motion of n
non-interacting identical strings in at euclidean three-space r3. the relevant motion
group m
n=1 cn which
is a collection of n unknotted and unlinked circles cn = s1 in r3. then

(n)(r3) in this case is constructed from the submanifold (n ) = `n

1(r3  (n )) = h1, . . . , n i

(6.8)

is the free group on n generators n, n = 1, . . . , n. the generating automorphisms for the
(n)(r3)) of aut(h1, . . . , n i) are then n, n and nm [14], where
dahm subgroup d(m

(6.9)

these automorphisms correspond, respectively, to a rotation through angle  of the n-
th circle cn about its diameter, to interchanging the n-th and n + 1-th circles, and to
transporting the n-th circle through the m-th circle. some of the relations of this motion
group can also be thereby deduced to be [21]:

(n)2 = 11

n n,n+1 (n)1 = n,n+1

(n)2 = 11
n m = m n

for |m  n|  2

n n+1 n = n+1 n n+1

(n n)4 = (n n,n+1)2 = 11

(6.10)

we shall now construct the appropriate topological bf eld theory to describe this
group [21]. we consider the usual bf action (2.16) for d = 3, p = 2 with the standard
coupling of the two-form eld b to the total derham current of the string worldsheets

n=1 (n)

2

2 = `n

and with

n

2 =

n (n)

2

(6.11)

xn=1

where n is the ux of string n (here we set the overall charge parameters q1, q2 equal
to 1). the crucial modication is in the coupling a  j of the one-form eld a, where
the new current j is represented by the vector eld [36]

j (x) =

n

xn=1z d2 (4)(x  xn())

x 
n ()


j 
n ()

which is dened in terms of the conserved worldsheet current

n () =  n()
j 


(6.12)

(6.13)

2 . we assume that dn  1((n)

here xn : (n)
2  r3 is the worldsheet embedding of string n and n() is some continuous
function on (n)
2 ) is a globally dened dierential one-
form on the string worldsheet, but that the function n itself is multi-valued. performing
a canonical split of the coordinates of the surface (n)
2 with 2  [0, 1] parametrizing the
loop of the closed string, we see that the current (6.13) induces a non-zero u(1) charge
on the worldsheet of string n:

qn =

1

z0

d2 j 1

n(1, 2) = n(1, 1)  n(1, 0)

(6.14)

this charge is a constant of the motion because both currents (6.12) and (6.13) dene
closed dierential forms on r3 and (n)
2 , respectively. the current (6.12) can thereby be
thought of as a smeared particle current which serves as a smoothed-out induced derham
current and which induces an electric charge on the string worldsheets.

39

the worldsheet scalar elds n() can be regarded as dynamical degrees of freedom in
the eld theory, in which case they are associated with the reparametrization invariances
of the string surfaces. fixing these functions to some prescribed form, with dn in the
cohomology classes appropriate to the charges (6.14), ruins the invariance of the strings
under dieomorphisms of s1. nevertheless, we will set n(1, 2) = qn2 and calculate
the resulting holonomies that arise in the modied wavefunctions of the quantum eld
theory. because the current (6.12) is a closed one-form, the relevant phase factor that
appears in the wavefunctions can be calculated in the same way as before, by using
the hodge decompositions for (6.12) analogous to those of the usual (singular) derham
currents. following the steps which led to (6.7) using the euclidean greens function for
the three-dimensional scalar laplacian operator, this straightforward calculation produces
the holonomy function

(6.15)

in this abelian holonomy representation, the images of the ip operators n and the
exchange generators n are all trivial on the hilbert space (see (6.9)). this owes to
the property that the strings have no abelian linking in three-dimensions, and also that
the function (6.15) yields no representation of the self-interactions of a given string
conguration. the slide operators nm, on the other hand, produce non-trivial quantum
phases in the wavefunctions under the adiabatic transport of string n through the loop
of string m. the resulting one-dimensional, unitary holonomy representation is therefore
given by

n = n = 1
i
k qnm

nm = e

(6.16)

the adiabatic holonomy in (6.16) arises from the fact that electric charge and ux can
link in three-dimensions, so that the sliding operation has the same eect as adiabatically
transporting a charge qn around a ux m [22]. whether or not this model, with a
particular xed conguration for the worldsheet scalar elds n(), leads to a sensible
hilbert space representation is a point which deserves further investigation. in any case,
this simple example shows the possibilities that exist for constructing representations of
arbitrary motion groups for any dimensionalities of the manifolds involved. it would also
be interesting to analyse global aspects of these sorts of couplings to bf gauge elds, along
the lines developed in earlier sections of this paper. this construction would then yield the
extra (multi-dimensional) generators and relations of the motion group which arise due to
homological eects, and also compute the curved space version of the holonomy function

40

(6.15). a holonomy function for strings in generic three-dimensional spatial manifolds has
been derived in [23] based on a marginal deformation of the canonical bf eld theory.

the representations obtained in this paper are all abelian (although multi-dimensional
when the space contains non-contractible cycles) and as such lead to very simple repre-
sentations of the generators and relations of the motion group. for this reason they do
not completely probe the algebraic structures of the motion group, although they do pro-
vide geometrical and eld theoretical origins for various aspects of it. more interesting
representations may be attainable using non-abelian bf theories, whereby the increase
in colour symmetry is expected to give rise to richer invariants of the embedded submani-
folds and of the spatial manifolds themselves. the holonomy operators in four-dimensional
non-abelian bf -theory have been studied recently in [16] where it was shown that surface
observables yield possibly new invariants of immersed surfaces in four-manifolds. a non-
abelian version of the bf model described in this subsection is analysed briey in [21].
it would also be interesting to incorporate interactions of various extended objects into
the framework of this paper. this would lead to a quantum eld theoretical description
of, for example, the motion groups associated with non-trivial knots and links immersed
in r3 such as those studied in [33]. furthermore, the incorporation of deformations of the
standard bf action, such as those studied in [23], would produce canonical versions of
the topological invariants obtained in [15].
