abstract

we propose a modication of the faddeev-popov procedure to construct the path
integral representation for the transition amplitude and the partition function for
gauge theories whose orbit space has a non-euclidean geometry. our approach is
based on the kato-trotter product formula modied appropriately to incorporate the
gauge invariance condition, and thereby equivalence to the dirac operator formalism
is guaranteed by construction. the modied path integral provides a solution to the
gribov obstruction as well as to the operator ordering problem when the orbit space
has curvature. a few explicit examples are given to illustrate new features of the
formalism developed. the method is applied to the kogut-susskind lattice gauge
theory to develop a nonperturbative functional integral for a quantum yang-mills
theory. feynmans conjecture about a relation between the mass gap and the orbit
space geometry in gluodynamics is discussed in the framework of the modied path
integral.

1. motivations. in what follows we consider only gauge theories of a special (yang-
mills) type where gauge transformations are linear transformations in the total congura-
tion space. let x be a conguration space which is assumed to be a euclidean space rn
unless specied otherwise. it is a representation space of a gauge group g so the action of
g on x is given by a linear transformation x  ()x. a formal sum over paths for the
action invariant under gauge transformations would diverge. to regularize it, faddeev and
popov have proposed to insert the identity [1]

1 = f p (x)z d() ((x)) ,

(1)

where (x) = 0 is a gauge condition and f p is the corresponding faddeev-popov deter-
minant, into the divergent path integral measure so that after a change of variables x  x
the (divergent) volume of the gauge group can be factorized out. the determinant f p is
calculated by doing the group average integral (1).

the formalism has provided a solution to two important problems in the perturbative
path integral quantization of gauge theories: the unitarity of the perturbative s-matrix
and the construction of a local eective gauge xed action. later on it has been observed
that the procedure becomes ill-dened beyond perturbation theory [2]. a geometrical
reason for the gribov obstruction is that there is no gauge condition which would provide
a global parameterization of the gauge orbit space m = x /g by a set of ane coordinates
without singularities [3]. this situation is often rendered concrete in the vanishing or even
sign changing of the faddeev-popov determinant. an additional problem expected in the

1

nonperturbative regime is the operator ordering ambiguity [4]. when the kinetic energy x2
is projected on the gauge orbit space m, one gets ( h, gph h), where h are local coordinates
on m and gph is an induced metric on m. the metric is not at [5]. in order to establish
a correspondence between the dirac operator formalism and the gauge-xed path integral,
the latter must be appropriately dened to take into account the operator ordering in the
physical kinetic energy operator. it is known that the formal path integral for a motion
on a curved manifold is ambiguous [6]. up to the second order of the perturbative yang-
mills theory, the operator ordering corrections have no eect on the physical s-matrix [4].
their role in a nonperturbative description is unknown. a standard argument used in
the dimensional regularization, i3(0) = 0, (a commutator of canonically conjugated eld
variables at the same spacetime point, which typically emerges in the operator ordering
terms) does not seem to be applicable because the validity of dimensional regularization
beyond perturbation theory is not justied [7]. finally, the space m may have a nontrivial
topology [3]. due to the locality of the faddeev-popov construction, global properties
of m are lost in the path integral. on the other hand the topology of the orbit space
may be important for the spectrum of physical excitations. feynman conjectured that
the mass gap in gluodynamics in (2+1) spacetime might be caused by a compactication
of certain directions in the conguration space upon an identication of gauge equivalent
congurations [8].

in this letter we propose a modication of the procedure (1) which gives a solution to
the above problems and leads to a well-dened path integral on the orbit space m. its
validity is demonstrated with a few examples.

2. a modied kato-trotter product formula. let h and a be a self-adjoint
hamiltonian and operators of constraints, respectively. we also assume [ h, a] = 0 which
holds for a suciently large class of physically interesting gauge models. let the gauge
group be compact. consider a projection operator

p = z d()eia a ,

z d() = 1 ,

p = p  = p 2 .

(2)

the operator (2) projects the total hilbert space onto the dirac subspace of gauge invariant
states. if the gauge group generated by a is not compact, we take a sequence c p of
rescaled projection operators p, where p projects on the subspace p 2
a  2, and then
consider the limit   0 in a weak sense. the coecients c can always be chosen so that the
limit exists and denes a hilbert space isomorphic to the dirac one [9]. let the hamiltonian
have the form h = h0+ v , where v = v (x) is a potential and h0 = p2/2 is a kinetic energy
operator. the operators h0 and v are assumed to be gauge invariant, i.e., they commute
with the constraint operators1. consider the evolution operator ut = exp(it h) in the
total hilbert space. the physical evolution operator is then u d
t = ut p. making use of
the kato-trotter product formula [11] for the evolution operator ut we get the following
1this assumption is justied for gauge theories of the yang-mills type. more general cases will be
considered elsewhere because they are technically more involved and require a phase-space representation
of quantum theory and a wiener measure regularization of the corresponding path integral as proposed in
[10].

in our previous work [10] we have shown that in the
where  = t /n and n  .
continuum limit the average gauge variables  play the role of the lagrange multipliers for
the constraints in the classical action. by making use of the classical theory of kolmogorov,
we gave an explicit construction of a countably additive probability measure for the gauge
functions (t). one natural choice was such that any set of values of (t) at any set of
distinct times is equally likely. now we show that this concept leads to a modication of
the faddeev-popov procedure.

first we observe that by construction

t (x, x) = u d

(4)

that is, the projected amplitude determines a genuine transition amplitude on the orbit
space m. to obtain its relation to the conventional gauge xed amplitude, we introduce
a set of local coordinates h on m via a change of variables

x = ()h ,

(5)

where the congurations x = h satisfy a gauge condition (x) = 0, i.e., h  h  x and
without loss of generality we may assume h  rm (unless specied otherwise) with m
being the number of physical degrees of freedom. the gauge invariant amplitude (4) can
be reduced on the gauge xing surface h: u d
t (h, h). this leads to a necessary
modication of the procedure (1): instead of averaging the gauge condition over the gauge
group, we propose to average an innitesimal evolution operator kernel for a free motion
as follows from the modied kato-trotter product formula (3)

t (x, x) = u d

u 0d



(h, h) = (2i)n/2z d()ei(h()h)2/2 .

(6)

since   0, the average integral can be done to proper order in  explicitly by the
stationary phase approximation. the kernel u d
 (h, h) is obtained by adding iv (h)
to the exponential in (6) in accordance with (3) because v (x) = v (h) thanks to the gauge
invariance of v .

suppose there exist transformations of the new variables  and h in (5),    + s
and h  hs, such that x(, h) = x( + s, hs), where all congurations xs = hs also satisfy
the gauge condition (h) = (hs) = 0. from ( + s)hs = ()h follows that hs = sh,
i.e., hs is a gribov copy of x = h on the gauge xing surface (x) = 0. if s is a collection
of all residual gauge transformations, the modular domain k is the quotient h/s. the
relation (5) determines a one-to-one correspondence if h  k and  parameterizes a group
manifold. if h, h  k, then the following relation holds
t (hs, h) = u d

t (h, h) .

it determines an s  invariant continuation of the transition amplitude to the covering
space h of the modular domain k. the faddeev-popov determinant species the volume
element on m [5], so for any integral involving only functions on m, f (x) = f (x), one
has r dxf (x) = vgrk dhf p (h)f (h), where vg is the volume of a gauge group. therefore
the folding of two projected innitesimal evolution operators reads

u d

2 (h, h) = zk

dh1f p (h1)u d

 (h, h1)u d

 (h1, h) .

(8)

the restriction of the integration domain in (8) does not lead to a formal restriction of
the integration domain in the path integral resulting from (3) in the continuum limit as
one might naively expect from (8). an important point is that, if k 6= h (the gribov
problem is present), then u 0d
(h, h) has no standard form of an innitesimal free transition
amplitude on a manifold proposed in [6] as we now proceed to demonstrate.



the stationary phase approximation can be applied before the reduction of u d

 (x, x)
on a gauge xing surface. a deviation from the conventional gauge-xing procedure results
from the fact that there may be more than just one stationary point. we can always shift
the origin of the average variable  so that one of the stationary points is at the origin  = 0.
let a be operators generating gauge transformations in x . decomposing the distance (x
()x)2 in the vicinity of the stationary point we nd (x  x, ax) = 0. so in the formal
continuum limit we get the condition a( x, x)  ( x, ax) = 0 induced by the averaging
procedure. this is nothing, but the gauss law enforcement for trajectories contributing
to u d
t (x, x). suppose there exist a gauge condition a(x) = 0, which involves no time
derivatives, such that a generic conguration x = h satisfying it also fullls identically
the gauss law, i.e., ( h, ah)  0. we will call it a natural gauge. in this case all other
stationary points in the integral (6) are c = s where (s) = s  s. therefore we get a
sum over the stationary points in the average integral (6) if the gribov problem is present.
still, in the continuum limit we have to control all terms of order . this means that
we need not only the leading term in the stationary phase approximation of (6) but also
the next two corrections to it. therefore the group element () should be decomposed
up to order 4 because 4/   as one is easily convinced by rescaling the integration
variable    . the measure should also be decomposed up to the necessary order to
control the -terms. the latter would yield quantum corrections to the classical potential
associated with the operator ordering in the kinetic energy operator on the orbit space. we
stress that the averaging procedure gives a unique ordering so that the integral is invariant
under general coordinate transformations on m, i.e., does not depend on the choice of 
(cf. (25)). thus,

 (h, h) is obtained by adding iv (h) to the exponential in (9). note
in general, the equations a( x, x) = 0 are not integrable therefore the functions a
discussed above do not exist. in this case we consider two possibilities. let c(h, h) is
the group element at a stationary point in (6). decomposing the distance in the vicinity
of the stationary point we get (h  ch, ach) = 0. let  be such that the latter
condition is also satised if h is replaced by h
s. in this case the sum over the stationary
points is again given by (9) where in the rst term of the exponential h
s is replaced by
c(h, h
s. in the most general case, the sum over stationary points does not coincide
with the sum over gribov copies. however for suciently small , the averaged short-time
transition amplitude can always be represented in the form (10). note that as  goes to
zero, u 0
 (x, x)  n (x  x). if we change the variables in the delta function according to
(5) and then do the gauge group average, we get, in general, a sum of delta functions on
the gauge xing surface. from the symmetry of the change of variables (5) it follows that
the support of the averaged delta function is formed by points h = h
s, h  k and h  h,
which means that the sum over s emerges again for suciently small . we will explain
below how to calculate relevant corrections to the leading order of the limit   0.
 (h, h1) in (8) by the sum (10) and make use of (7) applied to the
second kernel in (8): u d
 (h1s, h). since the measure on the orbit space does
not depend on a particular choice of the modular domain, dhsf p (hs) = dhf p (h), we
can extend the integration to the entire covering space by removing the sum over s

let us replace u d

 (h1, h) = u d

(11)

the absolute values bars accounts for a possible sign change of the faddeev-popov deter-
minant on the gauge xing surface. the procedure can be repeated from left to right in
the folding (3), thus removing the restriction of the integration domain and the sum over
copies in all intermediate times t  (0, t ). the sum over s for the initial conguration h
remains in the integral.

now we can formally take a continuum limit with the result

where gph is the induced metric on m. the local density qtpdet gph should be understood
as the result of the integration over the momenta in the corresponding time-sliced phase-
space path integral where the kinetic energy is (ph, g1
ph ph)/2 with ph being a canonical
momentum for h. to obtain (12), one usually sets h = h   for h = h(t) and h =
h(t  ) in each intermediate moment of time t and makes a decomposition into the power
series over . according to the relation, obtained in [5], between the volume of a gauge
orbit through x = h, the induced metric gph, and the faddeev-popov determinant we get
d(h + , h) = 2
f p (h)/ det gph(h) + o(). this relation explains the cancellation of the
absolute value of the faddeev-popov determinant in the folding (3) made in accordance

with the rule (11). the term 2/ in the exponential (9) gives rise to the kinetic energy
(, gph)/2 + o(3).

the most dicult part is to calculate the operator ordering corrections vq(h) in the
continuum limit. here we remark that d(h, h) has to be decomposed up to order 2,
while the exponential in (9) up to order 4 because the measure has support on paths
for which 2   (i.e., 4/  ). there is a technique, called the equivalence rules for

where the sum is extended over all permutations of the indices j to make the right-hand side

they are standard in the path internal formalism and turn to examples to illustrate the
main features of the new projection formalism. but before we do so, let us comment that
the eects on the energy spectrum caused by the modication of the path integral can be
found from the pole structure of the resolvent

3. examples. let us take the simplest example [4] where x  r3 and the gauge trans-
formations are rotations of x about the origin. the orbit space is a space of concentric
spheres. the natural gauge is xi = i1h. this gauge is not complete because there are
rotations that change the sign of h: h  h. these transformations form the group
s = z2. the modular domain is an open half-axis k = (0,). the measure on the orbit
space is obtained by introducing spherical coordinates on r3 so that h = |x|, while the
spherical angles parameterize the gauge group manifold so(3)/so(2). it is noteworthy to
observe that in the projection formalism there is no principal dierence between reducible
and irreducible gauge theories. here we obviously have a reducible case because x has
a stationary group so(2). the faddeev-popov determinant is dened with respect to a
subset of independent constraints. in this case, the constraints are three components of
the angular momentum. so we can take the angular momenta about the axes i = 2, 3 as
independent constraints and nd that f p = h2 in the full accordance with the measure
resulting from the spherical coordinates. the angular measure must be normalized by 4
to fulll the condition in (2). so eq. (6) assumes the form

system with the gauge-xed action sgf [h] = r t

where the amplitude ut (h, h) is given by a standard path integral for a one-dimensional
0 dt[ h2/2  v (h)]. there is no operator
the stationary phase approximation leads to the same result if one takes into account
all the stationary points, i.e., s = 0 and s = . the second stationary point is associated
with the only nontrivial residual gauge transformation h  h. here one also gets vq = 0
(cf. (9)). the same path integral can be derived from the schrodinger equation projected
on the orbit space [13]. it is not hard to calculate the partition function (15) for a harmonic
oscillator v = x2/2 = h2/2 and nd the resolvent (14). the poles determine the spectrum
en = 2n + 3/2. the distance between the energy levels is 2, while the oscillator frequency
in the hamiltonian is 1. the eect of the doubling would be lost, had we ignored the
redundant discrete gauge symmetry and calculated the partition function by a standard
path integral for the gauge-xed action sgf .

a simple model to illustrate the eect of the residual gauge symmetry in systems with
several physical degrees of freedom is a yang-mills theory in (1+0) spacetime [13]. a
total conguration space is a lie algebra x, and the gauge group acts in the adjoint
representation x  x1. the quadratic form in the exponential (6) is taken with
respect to the killing form on x: (x, x)  tr x2, where xy  [x, y] for any x, y  x and
the commutator stands for the lie bracket in x. if a matrix representation is assumed, for
compact groups it can always be normalized to the ordinary matrix trace. the gauss law
is  = [ x, x] = 0, therefore the natural gauge condition to parameterize m is x = h  h
where h is a cartan subalgebra (a maximal commutative subalgebra of x). the system has
r = dim h physical degrees of freedom. the average measure d() reads d det[(exp  
1)1]. in the exponential in (6) we get (h  exp()h)2. an adjoint transformation of
x to h is not unique and determined modulo the weyl group w acting in h. the weyl
transformations are inequivalent compositions of reections in the hyperplanes orthogonal
to simple roots in h [19]. so s = w and m  h/w = k +, where k + is the weyl chamber
in h. the stationary points of the integral (6) are c = w where the adjoint action of
the group element exp w on h transforms the latter by a weyl reection. introducing
the cartan-weyl basis [19] one can nd the jacobian of the change of variables (5) (the

faddeev-popov determinant) f p (h) = det h = 2(h) where (h) = q>0(, h); the
product is extended over all positive roots in h. the operator h acts in the orthogonal
complement of the cartan subalgebra. note that the cartan group is the stationary group
of h  h, so  should take its values in the orthogonal supplement of the cartan subalgebra.
the factor d(h, h) is given by the determinant of the operator hh. doing the stationary
phase approximation in the average integral, and taking then the folding (3) we nd

t (h, h) = xw
u d

[(h)(h

w )]1ut (h, h

w ) .

(18)

here the amplitude ut (h, h) is given by the conventional path integral (no restriction of

the integration domain to the weyl chamber) with the action r dt( h2/2  v (h)). there is

no operator ordering correction, and the physical metric is euclidean. the same integral
follows from a direct solution of the schrodinger equation [13]. the faddeev-popov de-
terminant vanishes at the hyperplanes (h, ) = 0. the boundary of the modular domain

7

(the weyl chamber) is formed by these hyperplanes when  runs over the simple roots.
the amplitude (18) remains nite at the singular points (the gribov horizon) because
(hw ) = pw (h) where pw = 1 is the parity of the corresponding weyl transformation
(cf. also (17): it remains nite at h = 0 or h = 0)). contributions of paths hitting the
horizon have a dramatic eect on the spectrum of the isotropic oscillator v = x2/2 = h2/2.
doing the path integral for ut (h, h) in (18) and calculating the poles of the resolvent (14)
we nd [13] en = 1n1 +   + rnr + n/2, where ni are non-negative integers, i are orders
of invariant irreducible symmetric tensors of the lie algebra, and r and n are, respectively,
the rank and dimension of the group (e.g., for su(r+1), i = i+1, i = 1, 2, ..., r). thus, the
physical frequencies of the isotropic oscillator appear to be i 6= 1. the partition fuction
calculated by a standard path integral for the gauge xed action of the model would lead
the spectrum of the isotropic oscillator (i.e., i  1).
to illustrate the eects of curvature of the orbit space, we consider a simple gauge
matrix model. let x be a real 22 matrix subject to the gauge transformations x  ()x
where   so(2). an invariant scalar product reads (x, x) = tr xt x with xt being a
transposed matrix x. the total conguration space is r4. let  be a generator of so(2),
i.e., ij = ji, and 12 = 1. then () = exp(). the gauss law enforced by the
projection is  = tr xt x = 0. it is not integrable. we parameterize m by triangular
matrices h21  0 (the gauge x21 = 0). the residual gauge transformations form the group
s = z2: h  h. the modular domain is a positive half-space h11 > 0. calculating
the jacobian of the change of variables (5) for this model we nd the faddeev-popov
determinant f p (h) = h11. the plane h11 = 0 is the gribov horizon. the average

measure in (6) reads (2)1r 2

(cid:0)h  e

h(cid:1)2

= (h, h) + (h, h)  2(h, h) cos   2(h, h) sin  .

(19)

a distinguished feature of this model from those considered above is that the stationary
point is a function of h and h. taking the derivative of (19) with respect to  and setting
it to zero, we nd

c = tan1 (h, h)
(h, h)

, s

c = c +  .

(20)

the second stationary point s
c is associated with the gribov transformation h  h. a
geometrical meaning of the transformation h  exp(c)h is transparent. the distance
[(h  h)2]1/2 between two points on the gauge xing plane is greater than the minimal
distance between the two gauge orbits through x = h and x = h. by shifting x along
the gauge orbit to x
c = exp(c)h a minimum of the distance between the orbits is
achieved. in such a way the metric on the orbit space emerges in the projection formalism.
its explicit form can be found as has been explained in section 2. we substitute  =
c(h, h) into (19), set h = h   and decompose (19) in the power series over . the
quadratic term (the leading term) determines the metric. we get (, gph(h)) = (, ) +
(, h)(h, )/(h, h). the metric is not at. the scalar riemann curvature of m is
r = 6/(h, h) = 6/(x, x). note that it is gauge invariant as it should be because the
curvature r does not depend on a choice of local coordinates on m. in the stationary
phase approximation the cosine and sine in (19) should be decomposed up to fourth order

8

in the vicinity of the stationary point. in this model quantum corrections do not vanish.
the innitesimal transition amplitude on m assumes the form

 (h, h) = (2i)3/2hd1/2(h, h)eis(h,h) + d1/2(h,h)eis(h,h)i ,
u d
s(h, h) = [(h, h) + (h, h)  2d(h, h)]/(2)  [8d(h, h)]1  v (h) ,

(21)

(22)

where d(h, h) = (h, h) cos c + (h, h) sin c. observe that the middle term in (22) is a
quantum correction to the classical potential in the short-time action (22) (it is proportional
2, if one restores the planck constant). the two rst terms in (22) determine (uniquely!)
the operator ordering in the kinetic energy operator on the orbit space (cf. (25)).

finally, we consider the case of an innite number of stationary points in the average
integral (6). this would have an eect that the modular domain k may become compact,
which, in turn, leads to a discrete spectrum regardless of the details of the potential and
therefore gives a mechanism for the gap between the ground state and the rst excited state.
a suitable soluble model is the yang-mills theory in cylindrical space time [14, 15, 16] where
space is compactied into a circle. a yang-mills theory without matter in two dimensions
has no physical degrees of freedom unless a spacetime has a nontrivial topology. the latter
is exactly our case. the total conguration space x is a space of all periodic connections
a(x + 2) = a(x) taking their values in a lie algebra of a compact lie group. the gauge
group g acts on x as a  a = a1  i1, and (x + 2) = (x) (i.e., the
gauge group elements  can be continuously deformed towards the group unit [17, 18]).
the exponential in (6) assumes the form r 2
0 dxtr(a  a)2 for any two congurations
a(x) and a(x). it is the distance between a(x) and a(x) introduced by feynman [8]. a
rigorous denition of the average integral over g can be given within the kogut-susskind
lattice gauge theory, to which we turn shortly. note, for example, that n in (6) is innite
because the number of degrees of freedom is determined by the number of fourier modes
of a(x).

here we assume the existence of a normalized average measure on g. the gauge group
average enforces the gauss law  =  a  i[a, a] = 0. the orbit space m can be param-
eterized by constant connections a(x) = h taking their values in the cartan subalgebra
h [14, 16]. this is the natural gauge because ( h, h)  0. the number of the physi-
cal degrees of freedom equals the rank of the gauge group. we set (x) = exp(i(x)).
the average function  takes its values in the lie algebra and its constant (independent
of x) fourier mode does not have any component in the cartan subalgebra because the
connection a(x) = h is invariant under constant gauge transformations from the cartan
subgroup. the gaussian integral over such functions can formally be done in (6) yielding
a determinant d1/2(h, h) of a dierential operator depending on h and h. in the lat-
tice formulation described below this procedure would not involve any innite factors in
d(h, h) as in the formal continuum limit. here we draw attention to the following feature.
a projection of any connection a(x) into the subspace of constant cartan connections
h is not unique and determined modulo the ane weyl transformations [16]. the ane
weyl group wa is a semidirect product of the weyl group w and the group of translation
along the group unit lattice in the cartan subalgebra [19]. thus, the number of stationary
points in the average integral (6) is innite because the number of elements wa is innite:

9

h  hs  hw + 2n/(, ), where hw is a weyl transformation of h,  any positive root,
n an integer. the modular domain k = h/wa is called the weyl cell [19]. it is compact
in h. this has a signicant eect on the spectrum of the system. in the continuum limit
the transition amplitude has the form (18) where the sum is extended over the ane weyl
group (over an innite number of stationary points h
s)[16], the faddeev-popov determi-

nant reads f p (h) = 2(h) and (h) = q>0 sin(h, ). there is no potential energy in
1 + 1 dimensional yang-mills theory (v (h)  0 in (18)). thus, we get an amplitude for a
free particle symmetrized over the ane weyl group.
in the simplest su(2) case, the system has only one physical degree of freedom. the
weyl transformations are reections hw = h and the translations over the group unit
lattice are shifts h  h + 2n. the amplitude (18) appears similar to the one for a particle
in an innite well or on a circle. the spectrum of such a system is discrete. in general,
we can calculate the poles of the resolvent (14) for the 2d yang-mills theory using our
path integral formalism and nd [16] the spectrum en = e0[(n, n)  (, )] where e0 is
a constant,  is a half-sum of all positive roots, and n ranges over a lattice in the weyl
chamber that labels all irreducible representation of the gauge group.

thus, an innite number of stationary points in the average integral (6) is, in fact,
an evidence that the physical conguration space (or its subspace) is compact. this is
the mathematical structure of the path integral which is to be sought when studying
the relation between the mass gap in gluodynamics and the compactness of the orbit
space. physically, the existence of an innite number of the stationary points separated by
dierent distances (large and small) implies that physical eigenstates of the hamiltonian
should exhibit a periodicity in some directions in x , which may cause the mass gap as has
been argued by feynman [8].

4. kogut-susskind lattice gauge theory. to fulll our program in realistic yang-
mills theory, we need a regularization at short distances to give a rigorous meaning to
the averaging integral (6) which is a functional integral. the simplest possibility is to
set the system on a lattice. since we still want to have a hamiltonian formalism, the
time should remain continuous. with such a choice of the regularization we arrive at the
kogut-susskind lattice gauge theory [20].

let y be a three-vector whose components are integer-valued in the lattice spacing
unit a, i.e., y labels the lattice sites. with each link connecting the lattice sites y and
y + ia, where i is the unit vector in the direction of the ith coordinate axis, we associate a
group element uy,i called the link variable. the collection of all values of all link variables
form the conguration space x of the system. the gauge group g acts on x by the rule
uy,i  yuy,i1
y+ia. therefore the average measure is a product of the normalized haar
measures at each site: d = qy dh(y). the kogut-susskind hamiltonian is h = h0 +v
where the potential v is nothing but the color magnetic energy on the lattice. the kinetic
energy is the sum of kinetic energies of a rigid rotators associated with each link variable

h0 = 1/2xy,i

tr ( uy,iu1

y,i )2 .

(23)

an important observation is that the coupling of the rotators occurs only through the
potential v . therefore the free amplitude u 0
t ({u},{u}), where {u} is a collection of

10

t (uy,i, u

congurations of rotators uy,i, is factorized into a product of the amplitudes for each rotator
u 0
y,i). an explicit form of the latter is well-known [21] (a transition amplitude of a
particle moving on a group manifold). this is to replace the free motion amplitude in a
euclidean space in the average integral (6). the average integral

u 0d



({u},{u}) = z yy

[dh(y)]yy,i

u 0

 (uy,i, yu

y,iy+ai)

(24)

can be calculated via the stationary phase approximation and the decomposition over the
characters of irreducible representations of the amplitudes u 0
t (u, u) proposed in [21]. thus,
we have reduced the problem of constructing the transition amplitude on the orbit space
to a standard mathematical problem in the group theory. it is important that the eects of
the riemann structure (metric) and topology of the orbit space are completely determined
by the averaging procedure proposed and do not depend on the details of self-interaction v .
note that the average in (24) induces a nontrivial coupling between the rotators because
six link variables attached to the same site are transformed with the same group element.
so the factorization of the amplitude on m is no longer possible. this is the result of the
enforcement of the gauss law in the physical amplitude.
thus, we get, in principle, a constructive and consistent procedure to study the eects
of the non-euclidean geometry of the orbit space on physical quantities like the spectrum
of low energy excitations. in particular, in the strong coupling limit (g large) the potential
v can be treated by perturbation theory [20]. to introduce an explicit parameterization
of the orbit space, one can, for example, make use of morse theory for the kogut-susskind
in this case, the initial conguration {u} in the
lattice gauge theory proposed in [22].
average integral (24) is taken from the corresponding modular domain. the projected
amplitude has a natural gauge invariant continuation to the covering space of the modular
domain.

5. conclusions. we have proposed a self-consistent path integral quantization of
gauge theories which resolves the gribov obstruction and provides control for the opera-
tor ordering problem, and it does not rely explicitly on the schrodinger equation on the
orbit space. this was our main goal. the continuum limit in the kogut-susskind lattice
gauge theory might still be a dicult analytical problem. however, it is believed that the
technique we developed might be useful to study the eects of the non-euclidean geometry
and topology of the orbit space in some physically reasonable approximations. we have
also demonstrated its eectiveness with several examples.

finally we point out a relation to the operator formalism. by making use of the
standard technique [6] to derive the schrodinger equation for the amplitude (9), we obtain
the physical hamilton operator on the orbit space

hph = 1/21

f p j (cid:0)f p [g1

ph ]jkk(cid:1) + v (h) ,

where j = /hj. observe that the kinetic energy in (25) does not coincide with the
laplace-beltrami operator on m because [det gph]1/2 6= f p as shown in [5]. the operator
(25) is hermitian with respect the scalar product where the volume element is dhf p . it
is also invariant under general coordinate transformations on m, i.e., its spectrum does
not depend on the choice of local coordinates on m and, therefore, is gauge invariant.
