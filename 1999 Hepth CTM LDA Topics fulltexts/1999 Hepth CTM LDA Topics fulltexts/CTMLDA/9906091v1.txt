abstract

the berezinsky-kosterlitz-thouless (bkt) type phase transitions in two-
dimensional systems with internal abelian continuous symmetries are inves-
tigated. the necessary conditions for they can take place are: 1) conformal
invariance of kinetic part of the model action; 2) vacuum manifold must be
degenerated with abelian and discrete homotopy group 1. then topolog-
ical excitations have logarithmically divergent energy and they can be de-
scribed by eective eld theories generalizing the two-dimensional euclidean
sine-gordon theory, which is an eective theory of the initial xy -model.
in particular, the eective actions for the two-dimensional chiral models on
maximal abelian tori tg of simple compact groups g are found. critical
properties of possible eective theories are determined and it is shown that
they are characterized by the coxeter numbers hg of lattices from the series
a, d, e, z and can be interpreted as those of conformal eld theories with
integer central charge c = n, where n is a rank of the groups 1 and g. a
possibility of restoration of full symmetry group g in massive phase is also
discussed.

1. introduction

a discovery of possibility of the phase transition (pt) in two-dimensional
xy -model [1] from very beginning has attracted a great attention of theoreti-
cians due to its unusual properties. first of all it seems that such pt contra-
dicts to the well-known theorems by peierls - landau [2, 3] and bogolyubov -
goldstone [4, 5] telling us that spontaneous magnetization and spontaneous
breaking of continuous symmetry cannot exist in low-dimensional (d  2)
systems [6, 7]. secondly, due to the absence of spontaneous magnetization,
correlation functions in low-temperature phase must fall o algebraically
[8, 9], what means that the whole low-temperature phase has to be mass-
less.

all these controversies were brilliantly resolved in series of papers by
berezinsky [10], popov [11] and by kosterlitz and thouless [12, 13], who
have proven for the rst time an important role of topological excitations -
vortices - with logarithmically divergent energies in this pt. an existence
of vortices is connected with the fact that the manifold of values of xy -
model m = s1 has nontrivial topology with the discrete abelian homotopy
group 1(m) = z, while a logarithmic divergence of the energy is connected
with conformal symmetry of the model. an account of vortices transforms
continuous compact symmetry u(1) into dual discrete symmetry z2  z,
where z2 is an automorphism group of s1 corresponding to the reection
symmetry of u(1) = s1. analogous pt take place in other systems with the
same symmetry: two-dimensional sos and 6-vertex lattice models, xxz
quantum spin chains [14] and euclidean sine-gordon (sg) model with non-
compact eld [15-18]. it appears that all these systems belong to the same
critical universality class. the sine-gordon model can be considered as an
eective theory of the bkt pt like the ginzburg - landau - wilson theories
are the eective theories of the pt of ii order (see, for example [19]).

the bkt pt can be also connected with some conformal theory, but now
there is a peculiarity. in contrast with usual situation of two-dimensional ii
order phase transitions, when an innite-dimensional conformal symmetry
with a rational central charge c takes place only at phase transition point
[20], in systems with bkt pt an innite-dimensional conformal symmetry
with integer central charge c = 1 exists not only at pt point (with logarith-
mic corrections), but in a whole low-temperature phase. thus we see that
the bkt pt is intimately related with two fundamental properties of the
systems: 1) a nontrivial topology described by discrete abelian homotopic

2

group 1 , 2) a conformal symmetry.

it is interesting to consider the bkt pt properties of such systems with
internal symmetries. these systems are related with tori, which are the
natural generalization of circle s1 with necessary properties.
it is clear
that the same properties take place in two-dimensional chiral models on tori
t n with 1(t n) = zn . this case eectively reduces to the previous one,
since only excitations with minimal topological charges ei = 1, i = 1, ..., n
are important and such charges with dierent i do not interact between
themselves. similar properties have  -models on general tori, connected
with arbitrary nondegenerate lattices l [21]. but, as has been shown in [21],
besides t n, there are the maximal abelian tori tg of the simple compact lie
groups g , which have (in case of simply connected g ) 1(tg) = lv 6= zn
(here lv is a dual root lattice of the corresponding lie algebra g ) and where
excitations with dierent vector topological charges interact with each other.
the next question arises naturally: how the properties of the above-
mentioned topological phase transition will depend on g ? this question
is important, for example, for string theory, where a compactication on
tg (more rigorously, on the simplied tori t n = tu (n) or tl = rn/l,
where l is some nondegenerate lattice of rank n ) is considered in dierent
aspects [22, 23], or for chiral models on g with reduced (or partially broken)
symmetry g  tg [24].

in this paper it will be shown that:
1) all critical properties of nonlinear  -models on compact tg can be
described in terms of eective eld theories with discrete symmetries, gener-
alizing sg theory;

2) they depend only on the coxeter number hl of the corresponding

lattice of topological charges lt;

3) dierent classes of universality of the bkt pt are dened by a, d, e, z

series of the integer-valued lattices;

4) all critical and low-temperature properties of these  -models (except
logarithmic corrections at criticality) can be described by corresponding con-
formal theories with integer central charge c = n, where n is a rank of
groups 1(tg) and g.

a possible restoration of the full symmetry group g in massive phase

will be also discussed.

2. nonlinear  -models on tg and vortices.

now we pass to consideration of the euclidean two-dimensional chiral eld
theories on tg , generalizing nonlinear  -model on a circle s1 or continuous
xy -model. their action has the following form

where t = e2i(h  )  tg, h = (h1, ..., hn)  c, which is the maximal
cartan subalgebra of the corresponding lie algebra g,
[hi, hj] = 0, n is
a rank of g,   =   ,  = 1, 2, and an isotropness property of the
weight system {w} of any  (g) -representation, which is a consequence of
invariance of the weight systems under discrete weyl group wg, is used

it will be convenient below to include a factor n as a normalization fac-
tor into trace t r . this gives us a canonical euclidean metric in space of
topological charges.

theories (1), like other two-dimensional chiral models, are invariant under
, which are a semi-direct

direct product of right (r) and left (l) groups n r(l)
product of tg and wg

ng = tg  wg.

(2)

the group ng is called a normalizator of tg and is a symmetry group of
torus tg.

these theories are the multicomponent generalization of xy -model, hav-

ing properties analogouos to those of xy -model:

1) a zero beta-functions () due to atness of tg;
2) non-trivial homotopy group 1 and corresponding vortex solutions.

mal contribution in each n -vortex sector of solutions will give vortices with
minimal |q|i . thus, in quasi-classical approximation (or in low t expansion)
one can represent a partition function of theory (5)

how the account of vortices reduces the initial symmetry group ng of the
 -model becomes obvious in the next section.

3. duality of the compact and noncompact theories.

in case of xy -model in long-wave quasi-classical approximation there is
an important connection between partition function of compact chiral theory
(1) on s1 and a partition function of the noncompact sg theory [15-17] with
action (modulo z0 )

ssg =z d2x(cid:18) 1

2

()2  2cos()(cid:19) .

(16)

this action has explicit invariance under dual discrete group z2  z. analo-
gous connection exist between compact chiral models on tg and noncompact
generalized sg theories.

to see this we note that the grand partition function zcg from (11) is
in its turn equivalent to partition function of noncompact scalar isovectorial
eld theory

zcg =z d  esef f , sef f =z 1

2

(  )2  2v (  ),

(17)

v (  ) =x{q}

exp i(q  ).

(18)

where p{q} goes over the set of minimal topological charges, and  

rn [25]. strictly speaking the theories (17) with arbitrary parameters 
and  are more general than initial  -models (1). the last have only one
parameter, a coupling constant . the representation of  -models in the
form (11,17) gives their embeddeding into general theories (17), since there
are the restrictions (15a,b), relating parameters  and . this fact will be
important later when a possible increasing of the symmetry of  -models will
be discussed (section 6).

since the set of minimal charges {q} is invariant under dual weyl group
wg , we see that the account of vortices reduces the initial symmetry group

7

ng into discrete dual group wg  l1
is a periodicity
q
lattice of potential v and, consequently, is inverse to all q  {q}. it follows
from their denitions that l1
q = l . this dual group generalizes the dual
group z2  z of xy -model.

. here a lattice l1

q

thus, in this semiclassical and long wavelength approximation compact
theory on a torus tg with continuous symmetry ng appears to be equivalent
(again modulo z0 ) to noncompact theory with periodic potential and an
innite discrete symmetry. these potentials contain the sum over all minimal
vectors {q} and can coincide with characters of some representations of
group g. for example, in case of l1
 = lv the sum in (18) goes over all dual
minimal roots. thus the corresponding potentials v for simply laced groups
from series a, d, e coincide with characters of adjoint representations of
these groups (modulo some constant, corresponding to zero weight). in this
case the general theories (17) can describe systems with symmetry g broken
to ng [25].

the noncompact theories (17) can be considered also as corresponding
linear  -models. thus we have shown that compact nonlinear  -models on
tg are equivalent in this approximation to noncompact linear  -models on
cartan tori of dual group tg.

for further consideration we need to classify all possible eective theories
of this type. it follows from (17,18) that they are determined by the set of
minimal vectors {q} of lattice lt

 , which satises the next restriction

lw  lt

  lv.

(19)

for  = min a lattice lt
 = lw. the lattices
lv and lw dier by a factor, which is isomorphic to the centre zg of group
g

 = lv, for  = ad a lattice lt

lw/lv = zg.

thus the set {q} can vary from the set of minimal vectors (it forms the so
called voronoi region or wigner - seitz cell of the corresponding lattice) of the
weight lattice till that of the root lattice. all possible cases are determined
by subgroups of the centre zg. for groups g with zg = 1 the lattices lv
and lw coincide.

4. phase transition in chiral models on tg .

in this section we consider topological phase transitions in chiral models
on tg using above obtained approximate equivalence of these compact theo-

8

ries with noncompact generalized sg eld theories (17). these eld theories
can be considered as eective theories for topological phase transitions in chi-
ral models dened on tg like the sine-gordon theory for xy -model [15-17]
and the ginzburg-landau-wilson theories for the ii order phase transitions
[19].

the investigation of the bkt type phase transition for all eective eld
theories of the form (17) was done by the renorm-group method in [25].
it was shown there that the new critical properties can have only theories
connected with even integer-valued lattices of a, d, e type. they have a
structure of root lattices of the corresponding simple groups g from simply
laced series a, d, e. all theories connected with other lattices have the same
critical properties as sg theory or its superpositions connected with lattice
zn. here we give brief description and write out obtained results, paying the
main attention to the symmetry and universality properties.

under renormalization transformations both parameters  and  are

renormalized. it is convenient to introduce two dimensionless parameters

(a)2 = g,  =

q2  8

8

(20)

where q2 is a square of the norm of the minimal vector topological charges
from {q}. the theories (17) are renormalizable only if the vectors from {q}
belong to some lattice (here lt
 ). a new critical properties can appear only if
a geometry of {q} is such that each vector q  {q} can be represented as a
sum of two other vectors from {q} [25]. the last property is very restrictive
and concides with a denition of the root systems {r} of simple groups from
series a, d, e [25] or with a denition of the root set of the even integer-
valued (in some scale) lattices of a, d, e types [26]. the sets of minimal
roots (or minimal dual roots) of all simple groups belong to four series of
integer-valued lattices a, d, e, z. for theories with sets {q} / a, d, e, all
critical properties will be the same as for theories with {q}  zn [25].

the rg equations for theories (17) with {q} from these lattices have the

next form [25] (here g = a, d, e )

dg
dl

= 2g + bgg2,

d
dl

= cgg2.

(21)

here bg = g, g is the multiplicity of the reproduction of v (  ) under
renormalization of (17) or the number of times by which each root can be

9

represented as a sum of two other roots, and cg = 2kg , where kg is
the value of the second casimir operator in adjoint representation (where
wa = ra )

ra
i ra

j = kgij.

(22)

xa

the rg equations of type (21) with coecients corresponding to the case
g = a2 have been obtained rstly in [27] under investigation of the melting
of the two-dimensional triangle lattice.

the eigenvalue of the second casimir operator kg for groups from series
a, d, e can be expressed in terms of the corresponding coxeter number hg

kg = 2hg,

hg =

(number of all roots)

(rank of group)

.

(23)

this denition of the coxeter number coincides with that of the coxeter
number of the corresponding lattices from series a, d, e. the coecient bg
can be calculated by dierent methods, and can be expressed also through
the coxeter number

g = kg  4 = 2(hg  2)

(23)

thus we see that all coecients of rg equations depend only on the coxeter
number hg or on the second casimir value kg . the rg equations (21)
have two separatrices [25, 27]:

u1,2  (g/)1,2 =

(24)

1

2cg (cid:2)(b2

g + 8cg)1/2  bg(cid:3) ,

where u1 corresponds to the phase separation line. the critical exponent
g, determining divergence of the correlation length 

  a exp(a g),

 =

t  tc

tc

,

is given by the next expression

g = 1/g = u1(cid:2)(bg/cg)2 + 8/cg)(cid:3)1/2

,

(25)

where 1/g is the lyapunov index of the separatrix 1 [25]. substituting
corresponding values one nds the declinations of two separatrices

u1,2 =(cid:26) 1/hg,

1/2.

10

(26)

note that u2 = 1/2 does not depend on g and is universal constant.
this fact is very important for a possibility of restoration of full symmetry
group g (see below section 6). a schematic phase diagram is depicted on
fig.1.

the dashed line of the initial values corresponds to the initial  -model.
this line is dened by the dependencies of the parameters  and  on
coupling constant  (equations (15a,b)). to low-temperature phase (de-
compactied, massless) corresponds region i, other regions answer to a high-
temperature (compact, massive) phase. in the region i the correlation length
 =  , and in the region ii, near separatrix 1,

  aea g , g = 2/(2 + hg) = 4/(4 + kg.)

(27)

using known values for the coxeter numbers hg and a geometry of the min-
imal dual root sets, we obtain the following expressions for critical exponents
g (see table 1) [25]

it is interesting to note, that groups d16 = o(32) and e8 , used in a
construction of the anomaly-free theories of strings [22], have identical g
(together with a29 ). the greatest number of possible values g is given by
an : 1/k and 2/(2k + 1), where k is an integer. for the theories with v ,
containing a set of the minimal roots, all indices remain the same, except
bn and cn which interchange themselves due to mutual duality of their
groups.

5. low temperature phase and conformal symmetry

the equality    everywhere in low-temperature phase means an
existence of conformal symmetry in it at large distancies. it can be seen also
from renormalized eective action sef f of the theory, which has in ir limit
the next form

where  is the ir limit value of the renormalized (l)

(29)

at the pt point  =  = 8/q2
min. in other points of low t phase 
depends on initial values of the system. it is well known that action (28)
describes free conformal theory with central charge c = n, here n is a
rank of group g. it means that long-wave low t properties of  -models,
dened on dierent torus tg, are the same for all groups with equal rank n.
only logarithmic corrections at pt pont will depend on group g through the
coxeter number hg. in this relation it becomes clear why the critical indexes
depend only on hg or c adg
. it agrees with the fact that on compact groups
all quantum conformal anomalies depend also only on hg (or dual hg ) [28].
in this connection it is interesting, that g coincides with a screening
factor in the formula for the central charge ck of ane algebra g [28]

(31)

12

at a level k = 1 .

the fact that low t phase is eectively free eld phase permits the calcu-
lation of correlation functions. for example, for correlation functions of the
exponentials one obtains the next expression

at the pt point (where  =  = 8/q2 = 4 ) an additional logariphmic

separatrix, the phase separation line, appears in them:

6. massive phase, asymptotic freedom

and global symmetry

the regions ii and iii answer in ir-limit to the high-temperature (in
statistical mechanics language), massive (in eld theory language), phase.
in uv-limit the region iii will be asymptotically free. a separatrix 2 with
decline u2 = 1/2 plays also an important role. in uv-limit it is a bound-
ary of the asymptotically free region iii. there is also another possibility
of the enhancement of the symmetry of the initial nonlinear  -model on
this separatrix.  -model (1) has at classical level two symmetries: 1) scale
(or conformal) symmetry, 2) isotopic global symmetry ng = tg  wg. at
quantum level the rst symmetry is, in general, spontaneously broken in ir
region by vortices (see (11)). for this reason  -model has in massive phase
a nite correlation length   m1 , where m is a characteristic mass scale
of the theory. this mass must depend on the coupling constant  or . the
behaviour of m near pt point is described by formula (27), where

 

  c

c

.

there is another region in massive phase, the separatrix 2, where m() can
be found. since in ir-limit this separatrix attracts all trajectories in massive

13

(or high-temperature) phase, it is very important to know an eective mass
scale on it. in main approximation on g it is given by pole in rg equation
[30] or by the formula

m   exp(z g

dx/(x))

where   a1 is uv cut-o parameter in momentum space, (x)) is a
 -function on the separatrix 2

therefore one obtaines

(g) = 2g2k g

2 /2 = 2g2hg.

m  a1 exp (1/2ghg).

the numerical factor in  -function can vary, in dependence on a normaliza-
tion of the coupling constants, but the fact that on a separatrix 2   k g
2 
hg is a corollary of the property that the declination of this separatrix u2
does not depend on g.

this expression for a mass scale on separatrix 2, depending only on kg,
coincides with those for chiral models on groups [30] and with those, ob-
tained from an exact solution of the appropriate fermion theories in main
approximation on g [31]

m   exp(2/(gkg/2)),

thus, it appears, that a mass scale on separatrix 2 coincides (at least for
g = a, d, e ) with that for g -invariant theories (chiral and fermionic),
connected with simple lie groups g, and can be expressed only through the
casimir operator kg by the universal formula (ours g  g/(2)2 )

m  e4/kgg

it means that on this separatrix the theory (17) can become g -invariant.
this can be seen also from the equivalence of the eective eld theories (17)
in cases g = an1 = su(n), g = dn = o(2n), g = e6,7 to the fermion
theories with the same glodal symmetry groups g [25a].

from here it follows, that in massive phase of chiral theory on tg ( g =
a, d, e ) in minimal representation (when lt
min = lv ) there is strong de-
pendence of the mass scale on coupling constant, which interpolates between

14

formula (27) near the pt point and formula (34) near the separatrix 2. the
rst region corresponds to symmetry of tg, which is a torus normalisator
ng = tg  wg, while the second one corresponds to more symmetric, g -
invariant, situation. analogous crossover in m() takes place in  -models
on other groups and in other representations, but the symmetry properties
in two limiting regions remain not so clear.
