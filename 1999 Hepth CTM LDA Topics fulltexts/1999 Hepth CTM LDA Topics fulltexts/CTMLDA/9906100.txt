(14) then, naively, (14) would green function n-th class homotopy. total green function obtained summing n weighting contribution factor n, i.e. one replace (14) gd = xn n gdn. since (15) must satisfy composition law, g = z dy g g, (15) (16) imply n = ein. (15) (16) (17) next question identify interval x dened. one give answer question writing rstly, green function gd(x) 4 gd(x) = xn= eingdn(x), = gd0(x) + xn=1 eingdn(x) + 1 xn= eingdn(x), (18) gdn(x) dened (14). x dened interval 0 < x < 2, three terms rhs (18) 1,p n=1 ein p n=1 ein respectively, gd(x) dened (18) satisfy (12). however x dened < x < , (12) satised zero mode (18) sign function. thus, interval function gd = 1 2 xn einsgn(x x + 2n), (19) correct green function one-dimensional fermion moving s1. let us analyse physical meaning . shift x x + 2 green function (19) trasforms gd = 1 2 xn= ein sgn, redening n 1 = m, one nds gd = ei gd. thus, recall (x) = r dxg(x), one obtains (x + 2) = ei(x), (20) (21) (22) implying one turn, spinor changes phase factor becomes measure statistics however question is; statistics?. question answered follows; one consider example de- scribing relative motion two fermions center mass decoupled. thus, eective one dimensional fermion described lagrangian l = 2 + ..., 5 (23) ... means terms involving center mass and, thus, phase factor (22) becomes measure interchange two particles. results easily generalized d-dimensions n-torus. indeed let us consider spacetime topology d1 = 1 time d1 (d 1) times s1. boundary conditions (6) become x0(1) = x1 1 x0(2) = x0 2, x1(1) = x1 1, x1(2) = x1 2 + 2n1, x2(1) = x2 1, x2(2) = x2 2 + 2n2, ... xd1(1) = xd1 1 , xd1(2) = xd1 2 + 2nd1, n winding numbers. using (24), green function n-th class homotopy gdn = lim m0z 0 = lim m0 (0x0 + dt d/2(cid:20) x x)z x=1 d1 0 m(cid:21) e (x)2 2t m2 dt 2 1 exp(cid:20) 2 , (x0)2 + pd1 2t =1 (x 2n)2 (24) m2t 2 (cid:21). (25) integral (25) computed using (9) massless limit (25) becomes gdn = 0x0 + pd1 |x0 + pd1 =1 (x 2n) , =1 (x 2n)| containing (14) particular case (after removing x0 putting = 1).
