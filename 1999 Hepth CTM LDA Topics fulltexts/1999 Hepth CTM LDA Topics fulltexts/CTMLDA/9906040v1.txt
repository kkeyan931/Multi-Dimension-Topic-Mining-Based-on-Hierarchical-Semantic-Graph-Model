abstract

the horizon of a static black hole in anti-desitter space can be spherical, planar, or
hyperbolic. the microscopic dynamics of the rst two classes of black holes have been
extensively discussed recently within the context of the ads/cft correspondence. we
argue that hyperbolic black holes introduce new and fruitful features in this respect,
allowing for more detailed comparisons between the weak and strong coupling regimes.
in particular, by focussing on the stress tensor and entropy of some particular states,
we identify unexpected increases in the entropy of superyangmills theory at strong
coupling that are not accompanied by increases in the energy. we describe a highly
degenerate state at zero temperature and zero energy density. we also nd that the
entanglement entropy across a rindler horizon in exact ads5 is larger than might have
been expected from the dual sym theory. besides, we show that hyperbolic black holes
can be described as thermal rindler states of the dual conformal eld theory in at space.

1 introduction

the correspondence between string theory in anti-desitter (ads) space and conformal eld
theory (cft) [1, 2, 3] provides a powerful basis for the study of the microscopic statistical
mechanics of black holes. in this framework, a black hole in ads is described as a thermal state
of the dual conformal eld theory1. the latter is dened on a background geometry that is
conformally related to the geometry at the boundary of the ads space. if we want to work in
a regime where the supergravity approximation to string theory is reliable, then the dual cft
has to be strongly coupled. the aim of this paper is to develop the duality for a class of black
holes peculiar to ads space, that will exhibit new and remarkable features.

it is known that the presence of a negative cosmological constant allows for more varied
types of horizon geometries than in asymptotically at situations. in ads the horizon of a black
hole can have positive, zero, or negative curvature. these are spherical, planar or hyperbolic
black holes, respectively. in four dimensions it is possible to construct horizons of arbitrary
topology by modding out discrete isometry groups. this is the origin of the name topological
black holes. we keep this name, even if it will be somewhat of a misnomer since we will not
be considering identications under discrete isometries. nevertheless, that is something that
could be implemented in a straightforward manner.

the microscopic study of planar black holes within string theory can be traced back to the
discussion in [4] of the statistical mechanics of black d3-branes. as this system is understood
now, the planar black hole in ads5 is dual to a thermal state of n =4 supersymmetric yang
mills (sym) theory in four dimensional minkowski space, with gauge group su(n), in the large
n limit and at a large value of the thooft coupling g2
y m n. we have very limited knowledge
of gauge theory in such a strong coupling regime, but the results that follow from calculations
using ads supergravity appear to be remarkably close to what we are able to compute using
free eld theory. the ads5/sym pair is the most studied case, but for other dimensions we
know that the temperature dependence of the dual eld theories is determined by conformal
invariance, and this behavior is indeed reproduced by planar black holes [5, 6].

spherical black holes, on the other hand, present a dierent qualitative feature, namely, a
phase transition at nite temperature [7]. as observed in [3, 6] this phase transition ts in
nicely with our expectations of a conning phase at low temperatures for large n theory on a
spatial sphere. this is remarkable. connement, however, is a phenomenon well beyond the
reach of perturbative eld theory. in the present paper, instead, we will be more interested in
situations where we can have some hope of connecting the weak and strong coupling regimes.
hyperbolic black holes in the ads/cft context have received comparatively little attention.
it was observed from their thermodynamics that the dual eld theories, dened on a spatial

1small spherical black holes in ads, however, are unstable, and their entropy is not an extensive quantity.

hyperboloid, should have no phase transitions as a function of temperature [8, 9]. at any non
zero temperature the theory is in a deconned phase, and would appear to be free from drastic
changes of degrees of freedom as the coupling is increased. on the other hand, the presence of
the length scale coming from the curvature of the hyperbolic space introduces a structure richer
than in the case of at space. there are two additional features of interest. one of them is the
fact that the ground state is in general dierent from the solution that is locally isometric to
ads. in fact, the latter is a solution at nite temperature, with non vanishing entropy, whose
origin is due to the presence of a nondegenerate (bifurcate) acceleration horizon in ads. a
second aspect of interest is that the boundary geometry is conformal to rindler space. it follows
that hyperbolic black holes admit a dual description as thermal rindler states of the cft in
at space.

perhaps the most startling consequence of our study will be that in the strong coupling
regime we are able to identify larger entropies than would be expected from the cft side.
the rst example of this is the ground state in the innite coupling regime, which is shown to
possess a large degeneracy, even if it is a zerotemperature, zeroenergy density state. the next
example we describe is a supergravity state that is locally isometric to ads5, with an entropy
that turns out to be larger than expected from the calculation at weak coupling. moreover,
the increase in the entropy is not accompanied by an increase in the energy of the state. we
therefore nd a common thread in these results, which would appear to point to the possibility
that sym theory requires the presence of states that can give rise to an entropy, but do not
contribute to the local energy density. curiously, states with precisely these properties have
been postulated from a dierent analysis of the ads/cft correspondence [10], where the issue
of causality in scattering processes was studied. although it is probably to soon to discard
other alternatives, it would be really exciting if the two phenomena were related.

the layout of the paper is as follows: section 2 introduces the black holes under considera-
tion, and their quasilocal stress-energy tensor and entropy are presented. part of these results
had been obtained in [9, 11]. in section 3 we provide a review of the dual cft description of
planar and spherical black holes with the focus on the aspects that will change when we look at
hyperbolic black holes. the supergravity and eld theoretical descriptions of the latter are the
subject of detailed comparison in section 4. section 5 develops the description of hyperbolic
black holes as rindler states of the dual cft in at spacetime. in section 6 we address the
issue of nite coupling corrections. finally, we discuss in section 7 the possible identication
of exotic states from this analysis.

the solutions for k = +1 are sometimes called schwarzschild-ads solutions: they reduce
to the standard schwarzschild solution when the cosmological constant vanishes, l  , and to
ads in global coordinates when  = 0. moreover, their topology is ir2  sn1, and the horizon
is the sphere sn1, like that of the schwarzschild solution. the case k = 0 makes appearance
when considering the nearhorizon limit of (nondilatonic) p-branes. their horizon has the
geometry of irn1, which can be periodically identied to give horizons of toroidal topology,
although we will not consider such possibilities. both the k = +1 and the k = 0 cases have
been extensively studied recently in the context of the ads/cft correspondence.

by contrast, the class of hyperbolic solutions k = 1 have received comparatively less
attention. they have been studied mostly in four dimensions, where, together with the other
two classes, they can be used to construct black holes with horizons of arbitrary topology:
if the hyperbolic space h 2 is identied under appropriate discrete subgroups of the isometry
group, then all the closed riemann surfaces of genus higher than 1 can be generated [12]. a
similar result holds for ve-dimensional black holes [9], as follows from the fact that an arbitrary
compact three-manifold of constant curvature can be constructed as a quotient of a universal
covering space of positive, zero or negative curvature. this is the origin of their denomination
as topological black holes. their appearance in m-theory and in the context of the ads/cft
correspondence was rst discussed, in four dimensions, in [8]. in higher dimensions they have
been studied in [9].

the temperature of these black holes is determined in the standard (euclidean) manner as

where r+ is the horizon radius. this relation can be inverted to nd

(5)

which allows us to take  as the parameter that determines the solution2. notice that in the
limit where r+  l the k = 1 classes of solutions approach the planar black hole class k = 0.
this admits an interpretation in terms of an innite volume limit, in which the curvature
radius of sn1 or h n1 is much larger than the thermal wavelength of the system [6].

at this point it is worth recalling that the solutions for  = 0 are all isometric to adsn+1,
and therefore can be locally transformed into one another by a simple redenition of coordi-
nates3. however, there are nontrivial dierences between these parametrizations. the metric
with  = 0, k = +1 describes ads in global coordinates, whereas k = 0 describes the poincare
(or horospheric) parametrization of ads. the latter describes a wedge of ads, since the coor-
dinate system breaks down at r = 0, see fig. 1a. this coordinate singularity corresponds to a
degenerate killing horizon. this means that, in contrast to bifurcate killing horizons, there is
no temperature associated to it. besides, its area vanishes. then, a common feature of ads
in both its k = +1 and k = 0 forms is the vanishing of entropy and temperature (and as we
will see, of energy density). they are to be thought of as the ground states of their respective
classes of solutions.

the solution with  = 0, k = 1, introduces a dierence here. while isometric as well to
ads, it covers a smaller portion of the entire manifold, as the coordinate patch breaks down
at r = r+ = l, see fig. 1b. however, in contrast to the horizon in poincare coordinates,
the horizon in this case is analogous to a rindler horizon. there is an associated inverse
temperature,  = 2l, and it has nonvanishing area. one should note that, among the
k = 1 class of black hole solutions, the one that is isometric to ads is not properly a black
hole. it is completely nonsingular, and in the absence of identications it does not possess an
event horizon. by contrast, the solutions with  6= 0 possess a singularity at r = 0.

for the k = 1 class of black holes, and in contrast to the k = +1, 0 classes, the zero
temperature solution is dierent from the one that is isometric to ads. in fact, for k = 1
there is a range of negative values for  such that the solutions still possess regular horizons.

2for k = +1 a second solution for r+ exists, with a negative sign for the square root, which corresponds to

small black holes in ads. we will not discuss these.

3other black-hole-type solutions constructed by performing identications in ads space have been considered
in [13]. however, they exhibit pathologies, not only within einstein-ads gravity [13] but also within the context
of the ads/cft correspondence [14].

for these values of the parameters, the black hole is extremal. the penrose diagram for a
hyperbolic black hole with negative  is like that of a reissner-nordstrom-ads black hole. for
positive  it is instead like that of a schwarzschild-ads black hole [12].

we now want to evaluate the thermodynamic functions for the solutions (1). in particular,
if we have the quasilocal stress-energy tensor, which is dened on the boundary of a region of
spacetime [15], as a function of the temperature then we can compute all other thermodynamic
functions such as the energy or entropy. recently, a prescription for computing the quasilocal
stress tensor of a solution in ads space has been proposed which appears to capture all of
the information relevant to the dual eld theory [16]. in this prescription, regularization does

5

not proceed by the traditional subtraction of similar divergences from a reference state to
which the solution is asymptotically matched. instead, in the regularization proposed in [16]
divergences are removed by subtraction of local counterterms at the boundary, in a manner
closely analogous to the subtraction of divergences in eld theory in curved spacetimes. as
such, it appears to be particularly suitable for constructing the stress tensor of the dual cft
starting from a supergravity solution (see also [17]). this technique has been extended and
generalized in [11] to all the dimensions of relevance for string/m-theory.

the metric on the boundary of ads, h (,  = 0, . . . , n  1), is conformally related to the
background metric of the eld theory . the conformal factor diverges near the boundary.
by the ads/cft correspondence, the quasilocal stress tensor for ads supergravity  can be
translated into the expectation value of the stress tensor of the dual eld theory hti, in the
strong coupling regime, as [17]

where the limiting approach to the boundary is assumed.

3 cft duals of spherical and planar black holesa brief

review

the ads/cft correspondence states that the full nonperturbative dynamics of quantum
gravity in a space that is asymptotic to adsn+1 can be formulated in terms of a dual conformal
eld theory dened on the n-dimensional causal boundary of the bulk spacetime. as discussed
in detail in [11], the issue of what is the geometry of the boundary of a given solution is, to
some extent, open, since it depends on how the spacetime is sliced radially as one approaches
the boundary. as an example, it was explicitly shown in [11] how the boundary of (euclidean)
adsn+1 can be chosen to be sn, irn, h n, ir  sn1, ir  h n1, and several other geometries.
we see then that the duals of ads quantum gravity are in general conformal eld theories
dened on curved backgrounds with xed geometry.

more specically, in the coordinates chosen in (1), the metric at the boundary, as r  ,

is of the form

hdxdx 

r2
l2 (dt2 + d2

k,n1) .

(14)

l2

the background spacetime for the dual eld theory, , is conformally related to this one,
and the conformal factor can be chosen to cancel the divergent factor r2/l2 in (14),  =
r2 h. in this way, the k = +1, 0,1 black holes admit a dual description in terms of a
limr
cft on, respectively, ir sn1, irn, ir h n1, each of these otherwise known as the einstein
universe, minkowski spacetime, and the static open universe, respectively. however, it should
be clear as well that by slicing, say, the k = 1 solutions in an adequate way, the spherical
and hyperbolic black holes can be described as states of the eld theory on minkowski space.
this can be achieved more simply by choosing adequately the conformal factor between h
and , see [18] for an example. we will make use of this idea later in section 5.

the case of k = 0 is particularly simple since, in the absence of any scale other than the
thermal wavelength, conformal invariance, together with staticity and homogeneity of the space,

(15)

(16)

the factor sb is the stefan-boltzmann constant, which is determined by the precise eld content
of the cft, and grows with the number of degrees of freedom of the theory. we will give it
below for the cases of interest.

as observed in [5, 3], for planar (k = 0) black holes r+   1, so the cft thermodynamic
functions (15), (16), agree with their ads black hole counterparts (9), (12), (13) up to the
stefan-boltzmann factors (notice that for k = 0, 0
k = 0). if one wants to make this equivalence
more precise and try to compare the precise stefan-boltzmann factors, then a specic dual
eld theory has to be supplied. string/m-theory provides duals for adsn+1, n = 2, 3, 4, 6, as
the cfts describing the worldvolume dynamics of stacks of parallel (d1+d5)-, m2-, d3-,
m5-branes. the dictionary for translating ads/cft quantities reads

where n is the number of parallel branes. the powers of n displayed above are measures of
the number of unconned degrees of freedom: for ads5, n is the rank of the gauge group
of the dual n =4 supersymmetric four dimensional su(n) yangmills theory. for ads3, c is
the central charge of the dual cft in two dimensions; however, since there are no k = 1
black holes in ads3 we will not deal with this case any longer. note that for generic number
of dimensions, the entry in the dictionary can be expected to be

n n/2 

ln1
g

for adsn+1 .

(18)

let us focus now on the pair ads5/(n =4 sym), in a discussion which can be traced back

to [4]. using (17), the results from (12) and (13) for k = 0, n = 4, become

ebh =

32n 2
84 v3 , sbh =

2n 2
23 v3 .

(19)

on the other hand, it is a standard result from free eld theory at nite temperature that the
factor sb in four dimensional thermal minkowski space for elds of dierent spin is

sb =

2

30 (cid:18)n0 +

7
4

n1/2 + 2n1(cid:19) ,

8

(20)

where n0 is the number of (real) scalars, n1/2 is the number of weyl (or majorana) fermions,
and n1 the number of gauge vectors. for n =4 su(n) sym at large n,

n0 = 6n 2 ,

n1/2 = 4n 2 ,

n0 = n 2 .

(21)

by plugging these values into (20) we nd sb = 2n 2/2, which leads to the wellknown result
[4] that

ebh =

3
4

esy m , sbh =

ssy m .

(22)

3
4

the sym result is obtained by computing oneloop vacuum diagrams, i.e., it is the leading term
in a perturbative expansion in the t hooft parameter g2
y m n. by contrast, the supergravity
approximation, on which the ads black hole result is based, is reliable only for large g2
y m n.
the mismatch in (22) is therefore interpreted as a strong coupling eect. an argument for why
the entropy should change only by a numerical factor of order one has been given in [19].

let us comment on two aspects of (22). the rst one is that the values for the energy and
entropy at strong coupling are smaller than their perturbative values. as a matter of fact, as
noted in [4], the result for ebh would agree with a perturbative calculation if, for some reason,
at strong coupling we had eectively n0 = 6n 2, n1/2 = 3n 2, n0 = 0, i.e., if only the scalar
multiplets contributed to the free energy, whereas the elds in the (n =1) vector multiplet could
not be excited. there is therefore a reduction in the eective number of degrees of freedom
at strong coupling. the second aspect we want to emphasize, for reasons which will be better
appreciated later, is that both the energy and the entropy are reduced by the same factor
3/4. that this should happen is a consequence of the fact that the temperature dependence
e   4 is the same at both strong and weak coupling, since it is xed by conformal invariance.
therefore, even if some degrees of freedom may get frozen at strong coupling, it appears that all
the states that contribute to the entropy also make a contribution to the energy of the system.
for the cases of ads4 and ads7, the dual conformal eld theories of n parallel m2- and
m5-branes are poorly known, and as a consequence it is impossible at present to discuss these
cases in the same detail as the ads5/sym pair.

overall, we can say that the qualitative aspects of the ads/cft duality for planar black
holes are fairly well understood, and in particular for ads5 the free eld theory seems to capture
a good deal of the thermodynamics at strong coupling.

turn now to k = 1, i.e., spherical black holes and their dual cfts, which according to (14)
are naturally dened on spatial spheres sn1. this introduces a length scale l in the theory.
as it happens, in this instance there appears a phenomenon that is absent from planar (and
hyperbolic) ads black holes. the thermodynamic analysis of the black hole solutions reveals a
phase transition at nite temperature between the state corresponding to  = 0 (global ads)
and the (large) black hole phase [7, 3, 6]. the low temperature phase (global ads) is interpreted

9

as a conned phase [3, 6]. this phenomenon, although expected from generic considerations,
can not be seen from a perturbative analysis of the eld theory. therefore, even if results
for conformal elds on s1  sn1 at a perturbative level (free eld theory) are available [20],
which can be employed to compute ecf t (), they can not be expected to provide us with
any information about the strongly coupled regime, at least at low temperatures: the phase
transition throws us into a region where perturbative eld theory is useless.

nevertheless, there is one result that can be meaningfully compared, namely, the casimir
energy associated to the eld theory on irs3. the dual supergravity solution is ads5 in global
coordinates, which is protected from strong coupling (string ) corrections [21]. moreover, the
casimir energy is essentially determined by the central charges of the n = 4 sym theory,
which receive no higher loop corrections [22]. indeed, it has been proven that the result from
free eld theory matches precisely the ads calculation [16].

4 ads/cft duality for hyperbolic black holes

hyperbolic black holes share with planar black holes the property that they do not exhibit
phase transitions at nite temperature. at any temperature the phase structure is dominated
by a black hole. then, the dual eld theory at strong coupling is expected to remain in an
unconned phase [8, 9]5. therefore, even if interactions are expected to introduce modications
(as was the factor 3/4 in (22) for planar black holes), we can hope to be able to extract valuable
information by trying to connect the weakly coupled and strongly coupled regimes.

an important feature of hyperbolic black holes is that the curvature of the hyperbolic space
h n1 introduces a new scale into the eld theory, and as a result the temperature dependence
is not fully xed by conformal invariance. the case of at space is contained in this class of
black holes as a limit (as was also for spherical black holes), which can be characterized as
the high temperature limit. at any other temperatures the thermodynamic functions are more
complicated, and encode more information than in the case of at spacetime. in particular, the
relationship between energy and entropy is not as simple as in (16), and the thermodynamic
magnitudes become more sensitive to the eld theory content.

furthermore, we will be able to crucially exploit a novel feature, absent from the other two
classes of black holes. as mentioned above, there is one particular state, the one corresponding
to  = 0 (i.e., r+ = l,  = 2l), which is isometric to ads. since ads5(s5) is an exact string

5it might be worth noting the following dierence: both for the planar and the hyperbolic systems the free
energy at any nonzero temperature goes like f  n 2 (for ads5/sym). for planar black holes, lim f = 0,
and one could say that the phase transition takes place at zero temperature, where the supergravity state is
ads5. in contrast, in the hyperbolic case the phase at t = 0 is still a black hole (the extremal one), and, as we
will see below, lim f  n 2.

10

state, protected from corrections in the thooft coupling g2
y m n, results at perturbative level
can be extrapolated to strong coupling. when we write ads with the hyperbolic slicing the
situation is, however, interestingly nontrivial, since the k = 1 description of ads does not
cover all of the spacetime, rather only a wedge. accordingly, in a computation of, say, the
partition function of the theory, states that lie outside this wedge are traced out, and will give
rise to an entropy, sometimes called entanglement entropy [23]. more precisely, on a cauchy
surface in the k = 1 patch, such as shown fig. 1b, the data to the left of the einstein-rosen
bridge are traced out. on the supergravity side, this entropy appears as an entropy associated
to the acceleration horizon. on the eld theory side we can compute the entropy of states
on a hyperbolic space. the detailed comparison of these quantities will only be possible for
ads5/sym, so we will devote most of the section to this case. other sides of the relation to
acceleration horizons will appear in section 5.

4.1 ads5/sym on a hyperboloid

let us then start by translating the strong coupling, black hole results of section 2 into eld
theory language by using (17), focusing on the ads5/sym dual pair. from eqs. (11), (5)
we nd, for the stress-energy tensor of strongly coupled sym on hyperbolic space at nite
temperature

for at space (19).

as explained, there are two states of particular interest. one is the extremal, zero temper-
ature (  ) black hole (7), and the other is the solution isometric to ads ( = 2l). for
the rst one we nd

notice that the energy for this state, and actually the entire stress tensor, is zero, so it seems
appropriate to identify it with the ground state of the theory. nevertheless, its entropy does
not vanish, a surprising fact that was noted in [11] and which we will discuss below.

turning now to the weakly coupled regime, we will make use of results obtained in [24]
for the stress tensor of conformal elds in s1  h 3. the essential input in the computation
is the density of eigenvalues of the wave operator in h 3 for elds of dierent spins. if h(s)
is the number of helicities of the spin s eld, and ns is the number of such elds, then, for

in the high temperature limit   0 the results from the previous section for at spacetime
are recovered. however, attention should be drawn to the mixing of temperature dependences
in (30) and (31). in contrast to the simple at space dependence (16), which would still hold if
only scalar elds were present, the presence of higher spin elds introduces a sensitivity to the
curvature of the space. this is reected in the 2 term inside brackets, which has a dierent
factor in (30) and (31).

12

compare now these results with the ones in the strongly coupled regime, eqs. (23), (24). it is
apparent that the dependence on the temperature is rather dierent, and in fact both come to
agree only at high temperatures, where we recover the same relationship as in (22).

for the ground state at zero temperature, the results

e(gauge)| = s(gauge)| = 0

(34)

are as expected for a conventional ground state. on the other hand, for the state at  = 2l
we get

e(gauge)|=2l =

s(gauge)|=2l =

3n 2
322l4 v3 ,
n 2
3l3 v3 .

(35)

(36)

it is immediate to notice that for both the ground state and the state at  = 2l the energy
computed using free eld theory agrees with the results in the strong coupling (supergravity)
regime, eqs. (27), (25).

as a matter of fact, not only in supergravity but also in the eld theory on s1  h n1
the state at  = 2l is singled out among states at other temperatures:
it can be formally
obtained from the vacuum of the einstein universe ir  sn1 by thermalization at imaginary
temperature t = (2il)1 [24]. the two calculations of (a) the casimir energy on ir s3 [16],
and (b) the energy of the state at  = 2l on s1  h 3, eqs. (35) and (27), are in this light seen
as the result of formally equivalent calculations. this is reected in the fact that both follow
from the same central charge of the eld theory.

despite the agreement for the energies of these states, the results for the entropy obtained
from supergravity are both dierent from the oneloop eld theory results. eq. (28) is telling
us that at innite thooft coupling there is a large degeneracy for the state at zero temperature
and zero energy density. such ground state degeneracies are highly unusual. the mismatch in
the entropy for the state at  = 2l is not less unexpected. as we had remarked, this state is
described in the bulk of ads as a wedge of the full ads5 spacetime. we shall argue in sec. 6
that not only the energy, but also the entropy of this state would have been expected to be
protected from corrections in the coupling. nevertheless, we nd at strong coupling an entropy
larger than that obtained from eld theory at the lowest perturbative order. the relationship
between both is simple,

s(sugra)|=2l =

s(gauge)|=2l .

(37)

3
2

this is in stark contrast to the situation for planar black holes, where there is an eective
reduction at strong coupling in the number of states available to the gauge theory. here we

13

nd instead an enhancement, but one that aects only the entropy, not the energy7.

it can be readily checked that the values of the energy at weak and strong coupling agree
only for the two values of the temperature  = 2l, . indeed, we would not have expected
agreement at any other temperature, due to strong coupling corrections. it is therefore dicult
to meaningfully make comparisons of the entropy expected at dierent temperatures. notice,
however, that, at any temperature,

s(gauge)()
e(gauge)() 

s(sugra)()

(38)

with equality only at innite temperature. although the dierent temperature dependence of
dierent elds makes it dicult to take this too literally, this inequality would suggest that
at strong coupling there appear to be more states contributing to the entropy than those that
contribute to the energy.

one last magnitude which is interesting for comparison purposes is the specic heat, since
it measures the response (susceptibility) of the degrees of freedom to thermal excitation. we
nd

7it is amusing to observe, although we do not mean to attach too much signicance to this remark, that
the mismatch between entropies at  = 2l, eq. (37), could be remedied by assuming that, at that particular
temperature, there were 4n 2 additional chiral multiplets, n0 = 8n 2, n1/2 = 4n 2, contributing to the entropy
but not to the stress tensor.

14

in which the specic heat grows with the characteristic four-dimensional dependence   3 =
t 3.

at low temperatures it is the spin-1/2 and spin-1 elds which dominate the specic heat, at
least at weak coupling (see (40)). the curvature of h 3, to which these elds are sensitive, makes
them more susceptible of being excited and as a consequence the specic heat grows faster, as
c  t instead of t 3. remarkably, this is also the behavior we nd at strong coupling, where
we do not know how to separate the contributions from dierent sets of degrees of freedom.
this suggests that, at low temperatures, the degrees of freedom at strong coupling are not too
dissimilar in nature from those that operate at weak coupling. curiously, the precise numerical
factor is o by the same fraction 4/3 as at high temperatures.

finally, at  = 2l the specic heats are exactly the same in the strongly coupled and weakly
coupled regimes. it would appear that even if extra states are present which contribute to the
entropy (albeit not to the energy), the susceptibility to thermal excitation is still dominated by
those states that make up the energy density.

4.2 other dimensions

the results (12) and (13) for the energy and entropy of topological black holes in section 2
can be expressed in terms of the temperature using (5) and then converted into expressions for
eld theory at strong coupling using the dictionary (17) or, more generally, (18). in turn, it is
possible as well to compute the corresponding quantities for free elds on hyperbolic space at
nite temperature. the contribution from a spin s eld to the energy on s1  h n1 is obtained
as

es() = h(s)

where h(s) is, as before, the number of physical states (helicities) for each eld, n1 is the
volume of the unit (n1)-sphere, the  (+) sign in the denominator applies to boson (fermion)
elds, and s() measures the degeneracy (density) of eigenvalues of the wave operator on the
hyperbolic space. it is known in the mathematical literature as the plancherel measure. the
latter has been computed for hyperbolic spaces in arbitrary dimensions for a wide variety of
elds. to quote, for h n , for real scalars [25],

that these results bear little resemblance to the ones that follow from supergravity calculations.

notice that not only the entropy but also the energy of this state is dierent from zero. indeed,
as noted in [11], for ads4 (and in fact for all even d adsd) it is the state at  = 2l that has
zero energy. and nevertheless it has nonzero entropy.

these results for ads4 are even more striking than those for ads5: the state that is isometric
to ads4 is a state at nite temperature and with nonzero entropy, which nevertheless has zero
energy density! this looks markedly dierent from conventional eld theory. moreover, there
appear states, namely, those for e   < 0, with total negative energy. the meaning of these
is unclear.

this free eld theory expression has nothing exotic about it. as the temperature goes to zero,
the energy vanishes. so does the entropy, too, as can be checked easily. however, the results

8these results have been used in [28] to perform calculations similar to those described here.

16

at strong coupling from ads calculations are puzzling: neither the state at zero temperature
nor the one at  = 2l have zero energy. both, moreover, have nonzero entropy.

it appears quite likely that in all these cases exotic states that contribute to the entropy
but not to the energy would be required to account for the black hole entropy. however, and
in contrast to the case of ads5/sym, for ads4 and ads7 free eld theory yields little useful
information.

5 dual cft description in rindler space

in the previous section we have chosen to describe hyperbolic black holes in terms of the theory
on ir  h n1. however, as noted at the beginning of section 3, it is possible to perform the
entire the description in terms of the theory on at space. all one has to do is slice the ads
black hole spacetime in a way that, near the boundary, the constant radius sections are at.
let us start by showing how this can be done explicitly for the solutions which are locally
isometric to adsn+1. in poincare coordinates,

ds2 =

r2
l2 (du dv + dx2

i ) +

l2
r2 dr2

(52)

(i = 1, . . . , n 2), where u, v are light-cone coordinates u = t xn1, v = t + xn1. now change

(the spatial hyperboloid h n1 is parametrized here in horospheric coordinates). the killing
horizon at r = l is mapped onto the null surfaces u, v = 0. now notice that as the boundary is
approached (r, r  ) the transformation (53) between boundary coordinates becomes

u  e/l ,

v  e/l .

(56)

this is precisely the transformation between minkowski and rindler coordinates. indeed, as
we approach the boundary,

r2
l2 ds2
r ,

(57)

where ds2
r is the metric on rindler space (with time rescaled by l). the conformal factor that
eects the change between ir  h n1 and the at (rindler) space at the asymptotic boundary
is r2/r2 = l2/ 2.

therefore ads in hyperbolic coordinates corresponds, in the description in terms of a eld
theory in at space, to the rindler state of the cft at  = 2l. this is, of course, the rindler
description of the minkowski vacuum. for the rindler observer, the latter is a mixed thermal
state described by a density matrix.

this relationship between the solutions that are isometric to ads, and their corresponding
states in the dual eld theories, is entirely analogous to that existing between btz black holes
and ads3 and the corresponding states in the dual 1 + 1 cfts [29], except for the fact that we
have not performed discrete identications.

for black holes with  6= 0 it is not simple to nd a global coordinate transformation that
eects the change from the hyperbolic to the at space description. however, we only need
the conformal factor that transforms the boundary geometries near innity, and then use it to
transform the stress tensors as in eq. (8). this was the procedure followed in [18] to nd a
description of spherical black holes in terms of the sym theory in minkowski space. we can
do the same thing here using the conformal factor l2/ 2, which according to eq. (57) takes us
to a rindler space geometry at the boundary.

we conclude then that, in the dual eld theory on at space, hyperbolic black holes corre-
spond to thermal rindler states at temperature . the one at temperature  = 2l is singled
out as corresponding to the poincare invariant vacuum in minkowski space. other states are
described, in imaginary time, using geometries with a conical singularity at  = 0. notice,
however, that there is no conical singularity in the description on ir  h n1.

given the conformal factor between hyperbolic space and rindler space, the stress tensor

in the latter is constructed as

ht

i(rindler)() =

l4

 4 hht

i(hyper)()  ht

i(hyper)( = 2l)i

(58)

(we are implicitly using the fact that the trace anomaly vanishes for both spaces). as a matter
of fact, the simple conformal relationship between rindler and hyperbolic space has been put
to use before in order to solve one of them from knowledge of the other [24] (see also, e.g.,
[30, 31] and references therein). conventionally, we have subtracted a -independent tensor
term in (58) in order that that the stress tensor vanishes at  = 2l. the reason is that hti
being a tensor that vanishes in the minkowski vacuum, it should vanish in that state in any
other coordinate system. recall that the minkowski vacuum is the global state of minimum
energy, which realizes the full poincare symmetry of the theory. the rindler vacuum (the state
for   ) can have negative energy because the minimization of the energy in rindler space
is constrained only by a subgroup of the poincare symmetries. the divergence of the vacuum

18

energy density as   0 is only expected, since the vacuum is made to accelerate innitely
hard at that point.

the construction (58) works the same way at weak and strong coupling. since at  = 2l
i(hyper) is the same in both regimes, the negative energy of the rindler
the stress tensor ht
vacuum is the same at zero and innite coupling. moreover, the subtraction of such a quantity
does not aect the calculation of the entropy. therefore, the subtraction (58) does not introduce
any signicant modication in our discussion.

the entropy density s in rindler space is equally obtained by rescaling the one in hyperbolic

space as

s(rindler)() =

l3
 3 s(hyper)() .

(59)

notice that the nite entropy density of the minkowski vacuum is not to be subtracted, since
it is physically relevant as entanglement entropy. a minkowski (global) observer assigns zero
entropy to this state. an accelerating observer, however, detects quantum uctuations of the
vacuum (they appear to him as thermal uctuations) and is sensitive to the vacuum activity
of the global fundamental state. the rindler entropy density at  = 2l therefore yields a
measure of the states that are subject to quantum uctuations in the global vacuum.

the discussion of the previous section can now be couched in terms of statements about the
energy and entropy of the cft in rindler space. we therefore nd that the rindler vacuum
is, at innite coupling, highly degenerate. on the other hand, a rindler observer accelerating
in the minkowski vacuum measures an entropy density for sym larger than would have been
expected from the weak coupling calculation.

6 finite t hooft coupling corrections

the calculations we have presented so far have been performed at two opposite ends of the scale
of the sym t hooft coupling, g2
y m n. gauge theory computations have been performed at the
level of oneloop vacuum diagrams, i.e., g2
y m n = 0, whereas the supergravity approximation
to type iib string theory is reliable when g2
y m n = l4/(22)  . in this section we want to
discuss the corrections that arise when g2

y m n deviates from these limits.

conformal invariance imposes strong restrictions on the form of nite coupling corrections
for the planar case, k = 0. the temperature dependence is xed, so a thermodynamic function
like the free energy must be of the form

f = f0 f (g2

y m n) ,

(60)

where f0 is the value at zero coupling. it is clear that the energy and entropy are corrected
by the same function f (g2
y m n). in contrast, for the hyperbolic or spherical systems one will

19

typically have

f = f0 f (g2

y m n, /l) ,

(61)

and the temperature dependence will change in general. indeed, we have seen explicitly that
the supergravity and gauge theory expressions for the energy and entropy have a very dierent
dependence on . one would ascribe the dierences to the eect of interactions as the coupling
is turned on.

perturbative interactions will change the weak coupling result through higherloop dia-
grams. for the sym theory in minkowski space, these have been computed in [32]. however,
the extension of these calculations to the spherical or hyperbolic cases is much more dicult,
since it implies solving an interacting theory in a curved background.

y m n, the rst corrections arise from o(3) =
at the other end of the scale,
y m n)3/2 corrections to the eective iib superstring action at low energies. the rele-

large g2

o((g2
vant term in the euclidean action is [33]

i = 

1

16g10 z d10xqg(10)3 (3)

8

w ,

(62)

where w is a scalar constructed out of contractions of four weyl tensors. one must consider
the entire ten dimensional theory, since it is not possible to keep the size of the sphere s5 xed
[34]. finite coupling corrections to the thermodynamics of planar black holes have been studied
in [33, 34], and spherical black holes in [35, 36].

let us focus on the hyperbolic solution at  = 2l. the full tendimensional solution
is locally ads5  s5, which is conformally at. therefore corrections from (62) vanish and
the geometry should remain the same. actually, it appears reasonable to assume that all 
corrections can be written in an appropriate scheme in terms of the weyl tensor. it then follows
that the temperature  = 2l is uncorrected, since it is determined entirely by the properties of
the metric. the value of the action for this solution is also unchanged. notice that this is not
aected by the need for regularization and subtraction of divergences from the gravitational
action. now, since the euclidean action is identied with f , it follows that the free energy
of the state at  = 2l should receive no corrections. we have already mentioned that, from
eld theory arguments, the energy of this state is protected, and indeed we have explicitly seen
that it takes the same value at zero and innite coupling. now, when higher derivative terms
are added to the einsteinhilbert action the entropy is in general no longer given by the area.
however, since

we would conclude that the entropy of sym on hyperbolic space at  = 2l should not change
its value when going from strong to weak coupling. this is not what we have found. the

s = (e  f ) ,

(63)

20

entropy at strong coupling is instead 3/2 times larger than the value computed from oneloop
vacuum diagrams. obviously, already the free energy is dierent in both regimes,

f(sugra)|=2l = 

5n 2
322l4 v3 =

15
7

f(gauge)|=2l .

(64)

this looks worrisome. while it cannot be completely discarded that subtle reasons invalidate
the assumption that the higher  corrections can be written in some scheme in terms of the
weyl tensor, it should be noted that the argument developed above is known to actually work
for the analogous situation of btzs3 black holes [33]. it would certainly seem bizarre if the
free energy were corrected, but the energy density (and specic heat) were not. let us then
discuss other alternatives here. in concluding that the entropy should remain unchanged we
have implicitly assumed that there is no phase transition in the theory as a function of the
coupling. it might then be that as the coupling is increased a phase transition occurs, in which
new states arise that do not change the energy but nevertheless increase the entropy. this
phase transition would have to be invisible in an expansion of f in inverse powers of g2
y m n.
another possibility, probably no less bizarre, is that the oneloop calculation at weak coupling
does not capture all of the states that build up the entropy. if this were the case, the correct
result to all orders would be the one given by the supergravity calculation. we will discuss
further this possibility later in sec. 7.

states other than the one at  = 2l are expected to receive corrections. these should
change the entire tendimensional metric, and with it the temperature and thermodynamic
functions. the calculations, however, are very long and laborious. while we hope to report
elsewhere on the corrections for hyperbolic black holes, for the moment we will estimate them by
following a simpler, nonrigorous method that has nevertheless proven to work surprinsingly
well for planar and spherical holes [33, 34, 35, 36]. this involves plugging the uncorrected
solution into (62) and taking the resulting term to yield the correction to the free energy. the
value for w , for either spherical, planar or hyperbolic black holes, is

(here g is the vedimensional newtons constant). observe that the correction goes smoothly
to zero for the locally ads state at k = 1 (r+  l,   0). in contrast, for spherical holes

21

for small  we have r+  1/2   1, and
(k = 1) the limit to global ads is not smooth:
i  2   4 diverges. the reason is that black holes at small , which are unstable, have
large temperatures and induce large uctuations. nevertheless, this is inconsequential to the
phase structure of the theory, since at low temperatures the system is in an ads phase, not in
a black hole phase.

it should be stressed that proceeding in this oversimplied way one misses the 3 corrections
to the temperature. nevertheless, at least for planar and spherical black holes the entropy
appears to come out correctly following this procedure. for generic k we nd

s =

v33

(r2

(67)

in the case of k = 1 this expression changes sign at the ads value r+ = l. in particular, for
the extremal state (r+ = l/2) this correction is negative,

(68)

so even if at innite coupling we nd a highly degenerate ground state, it might be that the
entropy steadily decreases to its zero value at zero coupling. one should bear in mind that
corrections to the metric, which change the temperature as a function of r+, can be expected
to shift the position of the zero temperature state.

7 discussion

we hope to have made it clear that hyperbolic black holes provide a rich setting to study the
ads/cft correspondence, introducing new features absent from both planar and spherical
black holes. a particularly interesting aspect is that they provide the possibility of study-
ing properties of the global ads vacuum and of the minkowski vacuum of the cft by the
introduction of accelerating observers.

the most striking result of our analysis has been the identication of enhancements in the
value of the entropy that are not accompanied by increments in the energy. the rst instance
of this phenomenon is the appearance of a large degeneracy for the ground state at innite
coupling. large degeneracies for supersymmetric, zero temperature black holes are well known
in string theory9. however, the hyperbolic extremal black hole is not supersymmetric, and in
the absence of supersymmetry it is extremely dicult to make interacting systems have highly

degenerate ground states10. it may be worth recalling that the result can be interpreted as
saying that the rindler vacuum of sym at innite t hooft coupling is highly degenerate.

no less unexpected is the strong/weak coupling discrepancy of the entropy of ads in hy-
perbolic slicing. this time it can be interpreted in terms of the degeneracy of the minkowski
vacuum of sym as seen by an accelerating observer. the mismatch in the entropy is the more
striking, since we did not expect corrections to the free energy of this state at any order. indeed,
we have explicitly seen that there are no corrections to o(3), and that the energy and specic
heat of that state take the same value at zero and innite coupling. barring subtleties in the
 expansion, alternative explanations must be sought. we have mentioned the possibility that
the states responsible for this entropy arise as a consequence of a phase transition as the cou-
pling is increased. another option might be that the nonrenormalization of the entropy still
works, but that the total entropy at small coupling is not entirely captured by standard one
loop vacuum diagrams, i.e., that the super-yang-mills theory possesses states that contribute
to the entropy but not to the energy density. this would sound like a rather exotic proposal.
however, very similar conclusions have been arrived at in [10], from the study of an entirely
dierent paradox in the ads/cft context. there, in order to preserve causality of the eld
theory when describing processes that take place far from the boundary of ads, it was found
necessary to postulate a very rich collection of hidden degrees of freedom of the sym theory
which store information but give rise to no local energy density (sic) [10]. it is striking that
this appears to be the sort of phenomenon we are observing in our study of black hole entropy.
from the arguments in [10] it would appear that these socalled precursor states are already
present at the weakly coupled level, and therefore might provide the extra degeneracies we have
found.

as noted, even if ads4 and ads7 also appear to exhibit enhanced entropies, the situation
is complicated by the lack of an adequate understanding of their dual eld theories. it will be
obviously interesting to nd other setups where these exotic entropies show up.

10a somewhat similar phenomenon has been found for charged ads black holes [37]. however, in that case
these large degeneracies are accompanied by equally large energy densities, and the states are moreover known
to be unstable.
