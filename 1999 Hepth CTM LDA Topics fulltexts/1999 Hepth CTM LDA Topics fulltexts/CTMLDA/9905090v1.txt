abstract

this paper describes perturbative framework, on the basis of the closed-

time-path formalism, in terms of quasiparticle picture for studying quasi-

uniform relativistic quantum eld systems near equilibrium and nonequilib-

rium quasistationary systems. two calculational schemes are introduced,

the one is formulated on the basis of the initial-particle distribution function

and the one is formulated on the basis of the physical-particle distribution

function. it is shown that both schemes are equivalent and lead to a gen-

eralized kinetic or boltzmann equation. concrete procedure of computing a

generic amplitude is presented.

1 introduction

since mid-fties, eorts have been made to incorporate quantum eld theory with

nonequilibrium statistical mechanics[1, 2, 3, 4]. necessity of this incorporation origi-

nated from the eld of solid-state physics. since then, rapid progress of the studies of

the early universe and the quark-gluon plasma, which is expected to be produced in

heavy-ion collisions and to have existed in the early universe, have further activated this

eld of research (cf., e.g., refs. 5) and 6)).

the standard formalism of nonequilibrium statistical quantum-eld theory is broadly

classied into two frameworks, the one is the closed-time-path (ctp) formalism [1, 2,
3, 7, 8] and the one is nonequilibrium thermo eld dynamics. in this paper, we employ

the former. throughout this paper, we are interested in quasiuniform systems near

equilibrium or nonequilibrium quasistationary systems, which we simply refer to as out-
of-equilibrium systems. a brief discussion is made in 5 on the relation with thermo
eld dynamics.

the out-of-equilibrium systems are characterized by two dierent spacetime scales:

microscopic or quantum-eld-theoretical and macroscopic or statistical. the rst scale,

the microscopic-correlation scale, characterizes the range of radiative correction to re-

actions taking place in the system while the second scale measures the relaxation of

the system. for a weak-coupling theory, in which we are interested in this paper, the

former scale is much smaller than the latter scale. a well-known intuitive picture (cf.,

e.g., ref. 7) for dealing with such systems is to separate spacetime into many cells
whose characteristic size, l ( = 0, ..., 3), is in between the microscopic and macro-

scopic scales. it is assumed that the correlation between dierent cells is negligible in

the sense that microscopic or elementary reactions can be regarded as taking place in a

single cell. on the other hand, in a single cell, relaxation phenomena are negligible.

above intuitive picture may be implemented as follows. let (x, y) be a generic
propagator. for an out-of-equilibrium system, (x, y), with x y xed, does not change
appreciably in the region |x  x 
0 | . l, where x   (x + y)/2 is the mid-point and
x 
0 is an arbitrary spacetime point. a self-energy part (x, y) enjoys similar property.
thus, x  may be used as a label for the spacetime cells and is called the macroscopic

oped into sophisticated form.[4, 10]

spacetime coordinates. on the other hand, relative spacetime coordinates x  y are
responsible for describing microscopic reactions taking place in a single spacetime cell.
an inverse fourier transformation with respect to the relative coordinates x  y yields

(x; p ) z d 4(x  y) eip (xy) (x, y)

(1.1)

(with p  = (p0, p)) together with a similar formula for . above observation shows
that, for |p | & 1/l, p  in (1.1) is regarded as the momentum of the quasiparticle
participating in the microscopic reaction under consideration.

microscopic reactions discussed above cause change in the density matrix that charac-

terizes the ensemble of the system, through which the number densities of quasiparticles
change with macroscopic spacetime x . dealing with this is the subject of the next
stage, where (weak) x -dependence of (x; p ) and (x; p ) are explicitly taken into

account.

the purpose of this paper is to clarify the structure of perturbative out-of-equilib-

rium quantum-eld theory through introducing two mutually equivalent calculational

schemes. the one (bare-n scheme) is formulated in terms of the initial- or bare-
number-density function (2 - 3) and the one (physical-n scheme) is formulated in terms
of the renormalized-number-density function (4). we demonstrate the equivalence of
both schemes through deriving a generalized boltzmann equation. concrete procedure

of computing a generic amplitude is presented in terms of feynman rules supplemented
with the derivative expansion and the generalized boltzmann equation (4). the bare-
n scheme is the scheme which is directly deduced from rst principles. to the best

knowledge of the present author, this scheme has never been comprehensively dealt

with. the physical-n scheme is the scheme which is employed in the literature. within

the ctp formalism, however, no self-consistent deduction of the scheme is available. we

deduce this scheme from rst principles in an unambiguous manner. comparison with
related work is made in 5.

throughout this paper, for the sake of deniteness, we take up a self-interacting

complex-scalar quantum eld theory. generalization to other theories is straightforward.

3

2 closed-time-path formalism

to make the paper self-contained, in this section, we give a brief review of the ctp

formalism.

2.1 preliminaries

the lagrangian (density) reads

l = (2 + m2) 


4

()2.

(2.2)

the ctp formalism is constructed through introducing an oriented closed-time path c
(= c1c2) in a complex-time plane, which goes from  to + (c1) and then returns
back from + to  (c2). the time argument x0 of the elds, (x), is on the time
path c. the perturbative scheme for computing time-path-ordered green functions is

summarized as a set of feynman rules (cf. ref. 2)).

throughout this paper, we assume, for simplicity, that the density matrix  commutes
(generalization to the case [, q] 6= 0 is
straightforward.) building blocks of feynman rules are the propagator, the vertex and

with the charge operator q:

[, q] = 0.

the so-called initial-correlations. the propagator  is dened by

and the initial correlations are

(x, y) = i tr(cid:2)tc(cid:0)(x)(y)(cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:0) ihtc(cid:0)(x)(y)(cid:1)i(cid:1)
c2n  i()ntr(cid:2) : (x1) ... (xn)(y1) ... (yn) : (cid:3)

(n  2).

(2.3)

(2.4)

here tc is the time-ordering operator along the time-path c and : ... : indicates to

take normal ordering with respect to the creation and annihilation operators in vacuum
theory. throughout this paper, we do not deal with c2n (n  2). (in appendix a, we
discuss a condition, under which c2n (n  2) may be ignored when compared to the
2n-point green function.)

a eld (x0, x) with x0  c1 [c2] is called a type-1 [type-2] eld, which we write
1(x) [2(x)]. the type-1 eld is also called a physical eld. a classical contour action
may be written in the form,

zc

dx0z d 3xl((x), (x)) = z +



dx0z d 3xhl(1(x), 

1(x))  l(2(x), 

2(x))i

4

 z d 4x l(x).

(2.5)

following refs. 4), 10) and 11), we call l(x) the hat-lagrangian (density). one can
choose any value for the time x0 = tin, when interaction-picture elds and heisenberg-
picture ones coincide. as in, e.g., refs. 2) and 3), we choose tin = , which we call
the initial time. it is well known that the theory is ultraviolet (uv) renormalizable. as

a matter of fact, in general, introduction of renormalization counter terms in vacuum

theory is sucient for the out-of-equilibrium theory to be renormalized. thus, in the

following, we do not write down explicitly the uv-renormalization counter terms. the
free hat-lagrangian l0, being bilinear in the elds, is obtained from (2.2) and (2.5):

l0 =  (2 + m2) 3 ,

(2.6)

where 3 is the third pauli matrix and

1, 

 =(cid:16)

2(cid:17) ,

 =  1

2 ! .

then, we are naturally lead to a two-component theory: the propagator, the vertex
and the self-energy part take 2  2 matrix form. we use b to denote the 2  2 matrix
whose (i, j) component is bij. from (2.5), we see that the vertex matrix v has simple
structure, v = diag(v,v) with v the vertex factor in vacuum theory. the propagator
(2.3) is translated into the propagator matrix:

(x, y) = ihtc(cid:16) (x) (y)(cid:17)i,

(2.7)

where tc acts as rearranging the elds in time-path order by recalling the above def-
inition of the type-1 and type-2 elds. in this and the next sections, taking l0 (eq.
(2.6)) as the free hat-lagrangian, we construct a perturbative scheme, which we call the

bare-n(umber) scheme.

fourier transforming the propagator (x, y) [the self-energy part (x, y)] on x  y,
we have (x; p ) [ (x; p )] (cf. eq. (1.1)). from the setup in 1, (x; p ) and (x; p )
vary slowly in x. then, we employ the derivative expansion:

g(x; p ) =(cid:20) 1 + (x  y )y  +

1
2

(x  y )(x  y )y y  + ...(cid:21) g(y ; p ),

(2.8)

5

where g stands for  or . throughout this paper, unless otherwise stated, we keep
only rst two terms in (2.8) (gradient approximation):

g(x; p )  g(y ; p ) + (x  y )  y g(y ; p ),

where and in the following,  is used to denote the gradient approximation.

2.2 quasiparticle representation for the propagator

in this subsection, pigeonholing the standard approach,[2, 4, 7, 8, 10] we introduce a

quasiparticle representation for the propagator.

2.2.1 preliminary

from (2.6) and (2.7), we have

(2

x + m2) (x, y) = (2

y + m2) (x, y) = 3  4(x  y)

and from (2.7), we can readily obtain

11 + 22 = 12 + 21,

r = 11  12 = i(x0  y0) (cid:2)(x), (y)(cid:3) ,
a = 11  21 = i(y0  x0) (cid:2)(x), (y)(cid:3) ,
c = 12 + 21 = ih(x)(y) + (y)(x)i,

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

where r, a and c are retarded, advanced and correlation functions, respectively.
equation (2.9) tells us that out of four elements ij (i, j = 1, 2), only three are inde-

pendent. for independent quantities, we choose r, a and c, which satisfy

(2

x + m2)r(a)(x, y) = (2
(2
x + m2)c(x, y) = (2

y + m2)r(a)(x, y) =  4(x  y),
y + m2)c(x, y) = 0.

(2.13)

it is to be noted that (2.9) is valid also for self-energy-part resummed propagators (see

appendix b).

note that [(x), (y)] is a c-number function.

6

2.2.2 quasiparticle representation

now we introduce a short-hand notation f  g, which is the function whose (x, y)
component is

[f  g](x, y) =z d 4zf (x, z)g(z, y).

motivated by equilibrium thermal eld theory (etft),[3, 4, 11, 12] we introduce new

functions[2, 4, 10]

f ()
b (x, y)  (x0  y0) g()

b (x, y; x0)

(with b for short of bare-n scheme) and write c(x, y) ( (+)
b )  ()
a ,

b )  (1 + 2f ()

r  (1 + 2f ()

c  ()
()

c + ()

c

) in the form,

(2.14)

where (+)s [()s] stand for the positive [negative] frequency part of s (cf. (1.1))
and 1 is the function whose (x, y) component is  4(x  y). (the representation of
c in terms of a vacuum-theory kit is given in appendix c.) as in etft, in the case
where  is diagonal in momentum space, (x, y) = (x  y) and

z d 3x ei pxg( )

b (x) =  n (p)  ( )

( = )

with n+ the number density of the quasiparticle and n the anti-quasiparticle (cf.
appendix c). in the present out-of-equilibrium case, g()
b (x, y; x0) depends on x (=
(x + y)/2) and on x0 only weakly. then, in what follows, for g()
b (x, y; x0), we use the
gradient approximation not only for x (= (x + y)/2) but also for x0.

it is worth noting that  may be written as (cf. (2.9) - (2.12) and (2.14))

bl(f ( )

b )  ( )

diag  br(f ( )
b ),
( )
diag = diag (r, a) ,

f ( )

b ! ,

1 + f ( )

br(f ( )

b ) =  1 + f ( )

1

b

b

f ( )

1 ! .

(2.15)

(2.16)

this representation may be interpreted in terms of retarded/advanced-quasiparticle
picture. we introduce retarded/advanced-quasiparticle elds, ra and 
ra, through
transformations (with obvious notation),

 = x =

( ) = x =

bl(f ( )

b )  ( )
ra,

 = x =

( ) = x =

( )
ra  br(f ( )
b ).

(2.17)

7

from (2.16), we see that

which guarantees the canonical commutation relation to be preserved:

bl(f ( )

b )  13  br(f ( )

b ) = 1 3,





(cid:20) (x),

(y)(cid:21) (x0  y0) = (cid:20) ra(x),



ra(y)(cid:21) (x0  y0)


= i3 4(x  y).

thus, the etft counterpart of (2.17) is called the (thermal) bogoliubov transformation.

[11] the statistical average of tc(cid:16) ra 
h tc(cid:16) ra(x) 

ra(cid:17) (cf. (2.7)) assumes the form
ra(y)(cid:17)i = i daig(x  y).

thus the elds ra and 
ra describe well-dened propagating modes in the system. it
is to be noted that 
ra is not the hermitian-conjugate of ra, which is a characteristic
feature of the theory of this type[4, 10]. substituting (2.17) and (2.18) into (2.7), (2.9) -

(2.18)

(2.12) with (2.14) are reproduced.

incidentally, nonequilibrium thermo eld dynamics[4, 10] is formulated by taking

(2.17) as one of the starting hypothesis.

now let us go to the p -space (cf. (1.1)). r and a go to (cf. (2.10) and (2.11))

r(a)(p ) =

1

p 2  m2  i(p0)0+ .

it is straightforward to show that (2.14) goes to

c(x; p )  2i(p0)[1 + 2g((p0))
(x; p) p

+2ix g((p0))

b

(x; p)] (p 2  m2)
p 2  m2 ,

p

where

g()

b (x; p) =z d(x  y)eip(xy)g()

b (x, y; x0)

with x = (x + y)/2. one can easily show that (2.13) with (2.14) yields

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

x0g()

b (x; p) = p  x g()

b (x; p) = 0.

then, the last term in (2.20) vanishes:

c(x; p )  2i(p0)[1 + 2g((p0))

b

(x; p)] (p 2  m2).

as has been mentioned in 1, (2.22) is meaningful in the region |p | & 1/l, where (2.14) makes

in (2.14) mixes with ()

sense. (in the region |p | . 1/l, ()
r(a)). for dealing with the region
|p | . 1/l, one should return back to the fundamental form (2.12) or rather to (c.2) in appendix
c. nevertheless, in most practical cases, one can use the form (2.22) for whole range of p . this
can be seen as follows. let t be a typical scale(s) of the system under consideration.
in the case
of thermal-equilibrium system, t is the temperature of the system. due to interactions, an eective
mass mind(x) is induced. in the case of m >> t , mind(x) is not much dierent from m and, for
m . t , a tadpole diagram induces mind(x) of o(t ). [since t (or even t ) is the scale that
characterizes microscopic reactions, the setup in 1 shows that 1/l << t (or t ).] since most
amplitudes, when computed in perturbation theory, are insensitive to the region |p | << mind(x) of
c(x; p ), the precise form of c(x; p ) in this region is irrelevant. in the following, we keep this in
mind. incidentally, in the case of equilibrium thermal qed or qcd (m = 0), there are some quantities

that diverge at infrared limits to leading order of hard-thermal-loop resummation scheme[13, 12]. for
analyzing such quantities, one should use the fundamental formula (2.12) in the region |p | . 1/l.

see also appendix c.

2.2.4 |p0| prescription
let us write[14] n ()
in the case of

b = n ()
b (x, p) appears in combination
with (p 2  m2) = (p2
p). then, at rst sight, it seems that no dierence arises
between n ()
b (x;p0,p). it is well known in etft that this
is not the case, since, in general, c(p ) is to be multiplied by the functions that are
singular at |p0| = ep. the correct choice has been known[15] for some time now to be
n ()
b (p0) (= n ()
b (|p0|)  the |p0| prescription. on the basis of this observation, we
assumek that the |p0| prescription should be adopted:

b (x; ep,p)  1  n ()

it is to be noted that the translation into the |p0| prescription is formally achieved

by (cf. (2.14) - (2.16)),

c = r  (1 + 2fb)  (1 + 2fb)  a,
 = bl(fb)  diag  br(fb),

where fb(x, y) is dened by

(2)4 eip (xy)fb(x; p )
with fb(x; p ) as in (2.27). now (2.21) turns out to

fb(x, y) =z d 4p

(x = (x + y)/2)

p  xfb(x; p ) = 0.

(2.28)

(2.29)

this is a continuity equation for fb along the ow line in a four-dimensional x -space.
equation (2.29) may be solved as

fb(x; p ) = fb(x0 = tin, x  (x0  tin)p/p0; p ),

(2.30)

kit can be shown that, as in etft, (2.27) is consistent with mass-derivative formula[16, 15] at least

up to the terms with second-order x -derivative.

10

where tin (= ) is the initial time (cf. 2.1). the propagator (x; p ) with this
fb(x; p ) takes the form (cf. (2.22)),

c(x; p ) = 2i (p0)[1 + 2fb(x; p )] (p 2  m2).

(2.31)

it is to be noted that (2.29) guarantees that all higher-order terms in the derivative

expansion (cf. (2.20)) vanish and, in this sense, (2.31) is exact.

3 bare-n scheme

interactions among the elds give rise to reactions taking place in a system, which, in

turn, causes a nontrivial change in the number density of quasiparticles. in this section,

within the bare-n scheme, we analyze the self-energy-part resummed propagator and

derive a generalized boltzmann equation.

3.1 self-energy part

3.2 self-energy-part resummed propagator

let us compute the self-energy-part resummed propagator, with the aid of the schwin-

ger-dyson equation,

using (2.28) and (3.32), we obtain

g =  +     g = g     + .

as a matter of course, gs obtained from (3.39) are written in the form (2.9) - (2.12)

with gr (ga) for r (a) and, for c,

gc = gr  (1 + 2fb)  (1 + 2fb)  ga  2gr  of f  ga.

(3.41)

let us compute g(x; p )s (x = (x + y)/2), the fourier transform of g(x, y)s on x y,
in etft, of f = 0. furthermore, as will be shown
to the gradient approximation.
below, of f is proportional to n ()/x , where n () are (the contribution to) the
physical number densities. then, in the derivative expansion for of f (x, y) (cf. (2.8)),

we keep only zeroth order (no-derivative) term. thus, we obtain

which diverges in the narrow-width approximation. in the next subsection, we inspect

this large contribution more closely.

3.3 generalized boltzmann equation

c2 to the physical number density, n (), is obtained from (3.47)

here  (= (x;p)), eq. (d.1) in appendix d, is the energy of the  (quasiparti-
cle/anti-quasiparticle) mode with momentum p, z (eq. (d.3)) is the wave-function
renormalization factor and   2/|imr(x;, p)| is the time during which the
 mode damps. (p)
 , eq. (3.49), that has come from (p)  iof f in (3.37), is the
net production rate of the quasiparticle (anti-quasiparticle) of momentum p (p). in
fact, (p)
 is the dierence between the production rate and the decay rate, so that (p)

is the net production rate. as mentioned above, in the case of equilibrium system,
(p)
 = 0 (detailed balance formula). note that (3.48) diverges in the narrow-width
limit,   .

recalling the notion of the spacetime cells (cf. 1), in appendix d2, we derive from

(3.48) a generalized boltzmann equation for n ()  n ()
n ()(x;,p) with n ()

the regular contributions (3.55) are a functional of fb, which, if one wants, can be
rewritten in terms of n () or n () by using the solution to (3.50) and (3.51). compu-
tational procedure, within the bare-n scheme, of a generic amplitude is similar to the
one within the physical-n scheme to be explained in 4.

4 physical-n scheme

4.1 preliminary
introducing new functions f ()(x, y)  (x0  y0) g()(x, y; x0), we redene the elds, 
and , by (2.17) with bl(r)(f ( )) for bl(r)(f ( )
b ) (cf. (2.16)). then, the elds in this
scheme are dierent from the elds in the previous sections. in fact, that f does not

satises (2.21) or (2.29) means that (2.13) does not hold. then, the interaction-picture
eld  and then also  do not obey the klein-gordon equation, (2 + m2) 6= 0, which
means that l0 in (2.6) is not the free hat-lagrangian. for the purpose of nding the
correct free hat-lagrangian l
x + m2) (x, y) with
(x, y) as in (2.15) with (2.16) (with f ( )

so far f has not been specied.

4.2 renormalization condition and the generalized boltz-

mann equation

we now dene f , such that the number densities

n (+)(x; +, p) = f (x; p0 = +, p),
n ()(x; ,p) = 1  f (x; p0 = +, p),
are as close as the physical-number densities n (). as seen in 3, g(1)
c2 in (3.46), which is
proportional to of f , yields a large contribution to the physical-number density. then,

(4.61)

as the determining equation for f , we adopt of f (x, y) = 0 or

of f (x; p ) = 0,

(4.62)

which we refer to as the renormalization condition for the number density. it should

be emphasized here that this condition is by no means unique. of f is a functional

16

of f , of f [f ]. we can adopt of f [ f ] = 0 (f 6= f ), provided that f (x; p0 = , p) =
f (x; p0 = , p).

in the present scheme with (4.62), transformed self-energy part  (cf. eq. (3.32)), is

diagonal:

br(f )    bl(f ) =  r

0

0 a ! ,

which is in conformity with the quasiparticle picture. thus, the present scheme is similar
in structure to etft: fourier transform of   , etc., are free from pinch singularity
and then no pinch singularity appears in perturbative calculations. similarly, gc(x; p )
and then also g(x; p ) are free from pinch singularity in the narrow-width limit (cf.
above after (3.46)).

let us inspect the physical implication of the renormalization condition (4.62). we
write rer(x; p ) = m 2(x) + re
r(x; p ), where m 2(x) is the contribution from a
tadpole diagram. note that the tadpole diagram does not contribute to (p). equation
(4.62) with (4.60) becomes

f (x; p )

(4.63)

recalling that n (+) = n (+)(x; p0 = +, p) [n () = n ()(x;p0 = ,p)] in (4.61)
is the number density of the quasiparticle [anti-quasiparticle] with momentum p [p],
it is straightforward to show that (4.63) becomes, on the mass-shell, p0 = ,

which is (almost) identical to (3.50) in the bare-n scheme. n () = n ()(x; ,p)
here is essentially (the main portion of) the relativistic wigner function and (4.64) is

the generalized kinetic or boltzmann equation (cf. ref. 17)).

4.3 procedure of solving (4.63)

equation (4.63) determines f (x; p ) self-consistently. one can also approximately solve

(4.63), order by order, through the following iterative procedure. at the rhs of (4.63),
three small quantities are involved; the coupling constant , (p) and f /x . (p)
measures how the system is far from equilibrium. p x f has been determined by
(4.63) at lower orders (than the order under consideration) but the other components of
x f reect the form of initial f x0 = tin
). for simplifying the following
presentation, we assume that the interplay of all these small quantities yields three

(= fb x0 = tin

terms, on the rhs of (4.63), which are of the same order of magnitude. [for other cases,

(trivial) modication of the following procedure is necessary.] let us write the rhs of
(4.63) r[c(f )], which is a functional of f , and expand f , c and r (with respect to
the small quantity): f =pi=0 f (i). c =pi=0 (i)
c are as in
(4.58) and f (0) is nothing but fb in 2 - 3 and satises (2.29), p  xf (0) = 0, whose
solution is given in (2.30).
zeroth order: equation (4.63) reduces to (2.29): p  xf (0) = 0.
first order: equation (4.63) becomes

c , r =pi=1 r(i). here (i)

2p  xf (1)(x; p ) = r(1)[(0)

c (f (0))].

(4.65)

solve (4.65) under the condition f (1)
second order: compute of f (x; p ) up to second x -derivative terms in the derivative
expansion, which yields the additional term on the rhs of (4.63),

x0 = tin

= 0.

r[c(f )] =

note that rer/x is a functional of f /x.
for the case of m2 . t 2 (with t the typical scale(s) of the system) the tadpole self-energy-part

higher orders: proceed similarly as above. further improvements of (4.58) and (4.63)

are necessary.

more ecient way is to construct -resummed propagator, eqs.

(3.42) - (3.45)

(of f = 0), at each order and use it for yet higher-order calculations (cf. below).

4.4 procedure of perturbative calculation

a(p1, ..., pn) =z

yi=1

d 4xi eipl plxl a(x1, ..., xn),

(4.67)

goes as follows.

1) draw all relevant skeleton diagrams. contribution to a of each skeleton diagram

may be written in the form,

d 4zi s(x1, ..., xn; z1, ..., zj).

(4.68)

z

j

yi=1

here x1, ..., xn are the external-vertex (spacetime) points and z1, ..., zj are the internal-
vertex (spacetime) points, which we collectively write 1, ..., n+j.

2) for the propagators involved in each skeleton diagram, use the self-energy-part

( ) resummed propagator g, with  and f computed to appropriate orders.
skeleton diagram that is already of nth order, it is sucient to use the bare propagators

[for the

and the bare f s.]

3) to analyze s(1, ..., n+j), as (not necessarily independent) variables, employ the
center-of-mass coordinates of a, x (= pn
i=1 xi/n), and relative coordinates ik  jk
(k = 1, ..., m with m a number of propagators). here ik and jk in ik  jk are the
points that are connected by the propagator g(ik, jk) ( gk) ,

gk = g(cid:18)ik + jk

2

; ik  jk(cid:19) =z d 4qk

(2)4 eiqk(ik jk ) g(cid:18) ik + jk

2

; qk(cid:19) ,

whose form is known above.

[an external as well as an internal point appears, in

general, in several relative coordinates.] it can easily be shown that (ik + jk)/2 may

19

be decomposed as

ik + jk

2

= x + xl (6=k)

ckl(il  jl),

(4.69)

where cs are numerical coecients. the decomposition (4.69) is not unique, which is

not the matter for our purpose. carry out the derivative expansion:

gk =z d 4qk

(2)4 eiqk(ik jk )

ckl(il  jl)  x + ...

pick up the term with (il  jl). multiplication of gl ( s) yields

1 + xl (6=k)

g(x; qk)).

the higher x -derivative terms ... in (4.70) may be dealt with similarly. deal with

all the propagators in the above manner. for f (x; ql)s, substitute the solution (of

appropriate order) to (4.62).

4) carry out the integrations over zs in (4.68), which yields j momentum-conserva-

tion -functions at the internal points, zs.

5) carry out the integrations over j qs. add the contributions of all the diagrams
to obtain a(x1, ..., xn), which, as is obvious from the above procedure, is of the form
a(x; x1  x2, ..., xn1  xn).

6) substitute a thus obtained into (4.67) to obtain

a(p1, ..., pn) = z d 4x a(x; p1, ..., pn),
a(x; p1, ..., pn) = z

(4.72)

where p 
i is the linear combination of p1, ..., pn. carry out the integration over xi+1  xi
(i = 1, ..., n  1) to obtain a(x; p1, ..., pn). note that the momentum conservation
pn
i=1 pi = 0 holds (cf., however, the footnote in 2.2.2). note also that a depends
weakly on x through f (x; qk)s. were it not for this x-dependence, integration over
x in (4.71) would yields (2)4 4(pi pi).

5 comparison with related work

as has been mentioned in 1, the physical-n scheme is employed in the literature.

5.1 ctp formalism

the derivation of the generalized boltzmann equation (gbe) in refs. 2), 7), 18) and
19) starts with the schwinger-dyson equation, eq. (3.38),

(cid:16) 1  (cid:17) g = g(cid:16) 1  (cid:17) = 1.

(5.73)

here we stress that this equation is nothing more than the equation that serves as

resumming the self-energy part to makeup the resummed propagator, (3.40) and (3.41).

then in order to derive the gbe, an additional input or condition is necessary. our

condition is the renormalization condition of f in (4.62).

we rst see the derivation in refs. 7), 18) and 19), in which the lowest nontrivial

order is dealt with. the condition adopted there is essentially

gc(x; p ) = [1 + 2f (x; p )] [gr(x; p )  ga(x; p )].

(5.74)

[to distinguish from ours, we write f  for f here.] no counter lagrangian is introduced,
so that the solution for gc to (5.73) is given by (3.41) with fb  f  (cf. the argument
in 4):

gc = gr  (1 + 2f )  (1 + 2f )  ga  2gr  of f  ga,

(5.75)

where of f is as in (3.34) with fb  f . note that the condition (5.74) is the leading
term of the (fourier transform of the) exact form (5.75) with of f =0.
fourier transforming (5.75) and equating with (5.74), one obtains

{f (x; p ), gr(x; p ) + ga(x; p )}  2igr(x; p )of f (x; p )ga(x; p ) .

(5.76)

to the lowest nontrivial order under consideration, the left-hand side (lhs) of (5.76) is

approximated as

lhs of (5.76)  2ip  xf (x; p ){g2

r(x; p ) + g2
= 4ip  xf (x; p )gr(x; p )ga(x; p )

a(x; p )}

(p0 = ) . (5.77)

in ref. 19), nonrelativistic many-body theory is dealt with.

21

using (5.77) in (5.76) on the mass-shell, p0 = , one gets the boltzmann equation.
in ref. 2) is given an all-order derivation of the gbe without introducing the counter

lagrangian. although the correct gbe comes out, the derivation is not self consistent.

in order to see this, we rst note that, upon using (3.33), (3.34) and (3.40), the solution

(5.75) may be rewritten as

(5.78)

(5.79)

(5.80)

g1

r gcg1

a = g1 + g2,
g1 = 11 + 22

g2 = 2(cid:0)f   1

a  1

r  f (cid:1) .

r  c  1

at an intermediate step of solving schwinger-dyson equation, there appears the term
r , which turns out to g2. in ref. 2), g2 is missing, and
proportional to 1
[it
thus, when interaction is switched o, gc does not reduce to the free form (2.28).
is to be noted that, in etft, fourier transform of 1
r is proportional to
(p 2 m2)2(p2 m2) and then vanishes.] as the additional condition, in place of (5.74),
gc = gr(1+f )(1+f )ga is adopted. this again contradicts with the exact solution
(5.75) unless of f = 0. by equating two relations above, the correct gbe comes about.
as has been shown in 4, for constructing a consistent physical-n scheme, the counter
lagrangian lc should be introduced. as mentioned above, however, lc is not introduced
in refs. 2), 7), 18) and 19), so that no self-consistent perturbative calculational procedure

r  c  1

is presented.

5.2 thermo eld dynamics (tfd)

in contrast to the ctp formalism, the tfd counterparts of 1 and 2 are independent
elds and mutually commutable.

we rst consider the equilibrium case. in spite of the fact mentioned above, as far as

the perturbation theory is concerned, tfd is equivalent to ctp formalism. however,
we should mention one point  the |p0| prescription (2.2.4). in the ctf formalism, the
|p0| prescription is deduced[15] from rst principles. the very existence of the vertical
segments[3, 12, 15] of the time-path in a complex time plane plays an important role. in

tfd, however, there is no counterpart of the vertical segments, and then, on the basis

of the consistency argument (with the spectral representation and kms condition), the
|p0| prescription is assumed.[11, 16]

22

the nonequilibrium tfd[4, 10] (netfd) is formulated on the basis of (nonequilib-

rium generalization of) the so-called thermal-state condition. as a consequence of this,

initial correlations (cf. (2.4) and appendix a) are absent. thus, when compared to the

(ctp) formalism developed in this paper, netfd may be applied to more restricted

class of nonequilibrium systems, i.e., the systems which are described by suitably de-

ned quasiparticles, in terms of which the generalized thermal-state condition holds. on

the other hand, netfd is a single-(space)time canonical formalism, without distinc-

tion between the microscopic- and macroscopic-(space)times. in this sense, netfd has

much wider applicability than the ctp formalism presented in this paper, the latter of

which applies only for out-of-equilibrium systems. incidentally, in netfd, there is

one parameter (s-parameter), which has no counter part in the ctp formalism.

our condition for determining the physical-number density, n (), is that, with
n (), pinch singularities (in the narrow-width limit) disappear. on the other hand,

netfd, in which the (space)time representation is employed, imposes an on-shell

renormalization condition, which results in the gbe. since the pinch singularity is a

notion in momentum space, it seems not to be immediately obvious how to translate this

condition to the (space)time representation as adopted in netfd. nevertheless, closer

inspection of the structure of both formalisms tells us that our condition is in accord

with the on-shell renormalization condition in netfd. incidentally, how to reconcile
the netfd with the |p0| prescription, a notion in momentum space, remains to be an
open question.

6 summary and discussion

in this paper, we have dealt with perturbative framework of out-of-equilibrium rela-

tivistic complex-scalar-eld systems. we have assumed the existence of two dierent

spacetime scales, the microscopic and macroscopic. the rst small scale characterizes

the microscopic correlations and the second large scale is inherent in the relaxation

phenomena.

we have proposed mutually equivalent two computational schemes, the bare-n and

physical-n schemes. both of them lead to the generalized relativistic kinetic or boltz-

mann equation. then, we have presented the procedure of perturbatively computing a

23

generic amplitude.

it is worth pointing out a similarity between two computational schemes presented

in this paper and those in uv-renormalization in vacuum theory. taking mass renor-

malization as an example, let us see this.

a bare scheme in vacuum theory takes l0 = (2 + m2

b), with mb the bare
b + i0+).
mass, as the free lagrangian. then, the propagator reads, (p ) = 1/(p 2  m2
perturbative computation of the renormalized mass m yields m = m(mb), which may
not necessarily be the physical mass m. perturbative computation of some quantity,
e.g., the physical mass m, yields the result as a function of mb, which may be rewritten,
using m = m(mb), in terms of m. the correspondence of the bare scheme here to the
bare-n scheme in 2 - 3 is as follows: l0  l0 in (2.6), (p )  (x; p ) (eqs. (2.10) -
(2.12) with (2.19) and (2.31)), mb  n ()
b , m  n (), m = m(mb)  eq. (3.48),
m  n ().

a physical scheme in vacuum theory takes l

b). the propagator is (p ) = 1/(p 2  m2 + i0+). m2  m2

0 = (2 + m2), with m the renor-
malized mass, as the free lagrangian and then there emerges the counter-lagrangian,
lc = (m2  m2
determined so that the perturbatively computed mass, m(m, m2  m2

scheme is constructed in terms of the renormalized-number density f (x; p ) [respect.

the renormalized mass m]. both perturbative schemes are equivalent. the rst scheme

starts with the bare quantity and the renormalization is done at the end, while in

the second scheme, the renormalization is done at the beginning by introducing the
counter hat-lagrangian lc [respect. lc].

under this condition, m is determined order by order in perturbation series. this is
also the case in the present physical-n scheme. f (or n ()) is dened so as to absorb

large contributions, which diverge in narrow-width limit. as pointed out above after
(4.62), there is arbitrariness in xing the nite part of f . in 4, we have imposed the
condition for determining f , under which f (x; p ) turns out to be determined order by

order in perturbation series.

appendix a: initial correlations

here we discuss to what extent, the initial correlations c2n, eq. (2.4), may be ignored.
we rst note that, in the two-component representation (cf. 2.1), cn has 2n compo-
nents, all of which are identical.[2] then, from (2.10) and (2.11), we see that c2, which
constitutes the medium part of the propagator , does not appear in the retarded and
advanced green functions. this means that c2 does not appear in the two-point correla-
tion in the linear response theory. with the aid of the standard formulae (cf. sections 2
and 5 of ref. 2)), one can also show that c2n does not appear in multi-point correlations
in the nonlinear as well as the linear response theory.

we decompose (x) as in vacuum theory:

(a.1)

(x) =z

d 3q

p2eq(2)3 (cid:2)a(q)eiqx + b(q)eiqx(cid:3) ,

where q0 = eq = pq2 + m2. a(q) [b(q)] in (a.1) is the annihilation [creation] operator
of a particle [antiparticle] in vacuum theory: [a(q), a(q)] = [b(q), b(q)] = (q  q).
we restrict our concern to c4. the argument below may be generalized to the case
of general c2n (n  3). we are concerned only with the particle part of , the part with
a(q) in (a.1), and of , the hermitian conjugate of . other parts may be dealt with

similarly and the same conclusion will be obtained.

substituting (a.1) and its hermitian conjugate to c4 in (2.4) and carrying out the

25

fourier transformation, we obtain, up to an numerical factor,

where hq1, q2; p1, p2i  ha(q1)a(q2)a(p1)a(p2)i and hq; pi  ha(q)a(p)i, etc. the
setup in 1, c4 does not change appreciably in a single spacetime cell, leads to approxi-
mate momentum-conservation:

(a.3)

(a.4)

c4  0 for

2

xj=1

(p 

j  q

thus, we may write

c4 =  4  2
xj=1

(pj  qj)! 2

yj=1(cid:2)+(p 2

j  m2) +(q2

j  m2)(cid:3) a,

where (p ) is the function whose width [height] is of o(1/l) [o(l)] and satises

r (p )dp  = 1, and +(p 2  m2)  (p0)(p 2  m2).

a transition probability or a rate of a microscopic reaction is related to an on-shell

amplitude. (in the case of equilibrium thermal eld theories, this relation is settled in
ref. 20).) let us now analyze the on-shell (p 2
j = m2, etc.) amplitudes. as can be seen
from (a.2), c4 per se does not contribute to the on-shell amplitudes. then, c4 or c4
appears as a part(s) of an on-shell amplitude. let us see the structure of a connected
amplitude s, which includes a single c4. we may write, with obvious notation,

s = z
 z

a f (p1, p2; q1, q2 = p1 + p2  q1).

(a.5)

c4 is to be compared with the four-point green functions g4s. for the sake of com-
4 , whose four legs are bare propagator

parison, we take the nth-order contribution, g(n)
with on-shell -function:

g(n)

yj=1(cid:2)(p 2

the counterpart of s, eq. (a.5), is

s(n) = n+1z

d 3p1d 3p2d 3q1

ep1ep2eq1e|p1+p2q1|

(ep1 + ep2  eq1  e|p1+p2q1|)

b f (p1, p2; q1, q2 = p1 + p2  q1).
from (a.5) and (a.6), we obtain, with obvious notation,

(a.6)

(a.7)

s
s(n)

= ha fi

n+1hb fi

.

noticing that a and b are dimensionless, we assume that a and b are of o(1). equation
(a.7) tells us that, unless hafi/hbfi << 1/n+1, c4 may not be ignored.

equation (c.2) in appendix c, together with the setup in 1, tells us that

ha(q)a(p)i  0

for |q  p| & 1/|l|.

(a.8)

motivated with this relation, we consider a case, where hq1, q2; p1, p2ic has the property
of factorizability or short-range correlation in momentum space:

hq1, q2; p1, p2ic  0

for |p1  q1| & 1/|l| and |p1  q2| & 1/|l|.

(a.9)

in this case, using (a.9) in (a.2), we see that (a.5) becomes, with obvious notation,

s 

1

v z d 3p1d 3p2

p1e2
p2

e2

(ep1 + ep2  eq1  e|p1+p2q1|)a f p1  q1  p2  q1

,

(a.10)

where v = l1l2l3. on the basis of the observation made at the footnote in 2.2.2, we
assume that s(n) in (a.6) is insensitive to the region |q1| . 1/|l|. then, in (a.6), the
integration over q1 yields an o(t 3) quantity, with t the typical scale(s) of the system,
which characterizes the microscopic reaction and is much larger than 1/|l|. since we
have assumed that a and b are of o(1), we obtain

s
s(n)

= o(cid:18)

1

n+1t 3 v (cid:19) .

thus, s/ s(n) << 1 and the initial correlation c4 may be ignored. there are, however,
several cases, in which this observation does not apply:

 dimensionless quantity a in (a.10) is large.
 f in (a.10) is extremely large at q1  p1 and/or q1  p2.
 in massless theory (m = 0), some quantities are sensitive to the infrared region (cf.
the footnote in 2.2.2). if s is (a.5) is such a quantity, more elaborate analysis is
necessary to see if c4 may be ignored or not.

appendix b: some properties of the propagator and

the self-energy part

self-energy-part ( ) inserted propagator is obtained by perturbatively computing the
formula for the full propagator:

g(x, y)  ihtc(cid:16) (x) (y)eir d 4z lint(z)(cid:17)i,

(b.1)

where lint (= l  l0) is the interaction hat-lagrangian. from this, we obtain g11 +
g22 = g12 + g21, of which (2.9) is a special case. applying this to the single-  inserted
propagator ( g      ) and using (2.9), we obtain p2

taking complex-conjugate of (b.1), we see that

i, j=1 ij(x, y) = 0.

ig11(x, y) = [ig22(y, x)] ,

ig12(21)(x, y) =(cid:2)ig12(21)(y, x)(cid:3) .

using this for g   and g      , we obtain

i((x, y))11 = [i((y, x))22] , i((x, y))12(21) =(cid:2)i((y, x))12(21)(cid:3)

fourier transformation on x  y yields

.

((x; p ))11 = ((x; p ))
22,
((x; p ))12 ,

((x; p ))21 : pure imaginary.

using this in (3.33), we obtain a(x; p ) = [r(x; p )].

in the case of physical-n scheme, lc in 4 contributes to ,  v(x, y)  (x, y) (cf.

(4.57)). this additional contribution does not invalidate the above properties.

appendix c: representation of c in terms of a vac-

uum-theory kit

here obtain the expression for c and the number density n ()
in vacuum theory.

straightforward but a bit lengthy calculation using (a.1) and its hermitian conjugate

(c.2)

where p  q  q/2 and e  ep.

let us rst show that the contribution of the third and fourth terms of the bracketed

quantities in (c.2) is negligibly small. from the setup in 1, (1)
c (x; p ) varies slowly
in x, which means that ha(p+)b(p)i  hb(p)a(p+)i  0 for |q| & 1/|l| and
e+ + e & 1/l0, where l is the size of a spacetime cell (see 1). this can be realized
only if m . 1/l0. however, as mentioned at the second footnote in 4.3, in the case
of m . 1/l0, the bare propagator should be replaced with the tadpole self-energy-part
resummed propagator. the tadpole induces the mass of o(t ) with t the typical

scale(s) of the system, so that e+ + e >> 1/l0.

let us turn to the rst and second terms in (c.2). same reasoning as above leads
to ha(p+)a(p)i  hb(p+)b(p)i  0 for |q| & 1/|l|. we shall consider the hard
region |p | > o(1/l). from the rst term, we pick out

(cid:18)p0

then, to the gradient approximation, we have (p0  (e+ + e)/2)  (p0  ep).
similarly, we have e+e  e2
p . the second term in (c.2) may be dealt with similarly.

after all this, for |p | > o(1/l), we nally obtain

ic(x; p )  2h(p0){1 + 2n (+)
+(p0){1 + 2n ()

b (x;p)}i (p 2  m2),

parison of (c.3) with (2.22) shows that

b (x; p),

b (x; p) = 1  n ()

b (x;p).

for c(x; p ) with |p | . 1/l, one should use the fundamental formula (c.2).

incidentally, in the case where  is diagonal in momentum space, ha(p)a(q)i =
b (x; p) = n(p), where

(p  q)n+(p) and hb(p)b(q)i = (p  q)n(p), we obtain n ()
n are the number densities of the (anti)particle in vacuum theory.

appendix d derivation of (3.48) and (3.50)

d1 derivation of (3.48)

let us start with computing the piece of (3.47), which diverges in the narrow-width limit,
imr  (p0)0+. the relevant region (of integration) is where re(g1
r (x; p )) =
re(g1
a (x; p )) = p 2  m2  rer(x; p )  0. we dene on the mass-shell p0 =
(x;p) ( ) through

d2 derivation of (3.50)

we note that (p)
 /2 in (3.48) is the change in the physical-number density, during
the time interval /2, due the the net production rate. in 1, we have introduced the
spacetime cells, whose size is l ( = 0, 1, 2, 3). it is quite natural to take  = l0,

31

where l0 is the size of the time direction of the spacetime cell (including the spacetime
point x  in (3.48)).
[strictly speaking, in general, + 6= . however, in the present
 /2 in
(3.48) is half of the net production probability, due to the reactions, during the time

crude argument, we ignore this dierence.]

it is interesting to note that (p)

interval  = l0. [in this respect, cf. ref. 21).]

noticing that we are concerned about the quasiparticle mode with momentum p
[anti-quasiparticle mode with momentum p], we see that (3.48) leads to the relations,

n(x0 + l0, x + vl0;,p)  n(x0, x;,p)
