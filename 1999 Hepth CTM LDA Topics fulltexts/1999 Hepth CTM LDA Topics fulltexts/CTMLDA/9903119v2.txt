abstract

the correlations of the qcd dirac eigenvalues are studied with use of an ex-
tended chiral random matrix model. the inclusion of spatial dependence which the
original model lacks enables us to investigate the eects of diusion modes. we
get analytical expressions of level correlation functions with non-universal behavior
caused by diusion modes which is characterized by thouless energy. pion mode is
shown to be responsible for these diusion eects when qcd vacuum is considered
a disordered medium.

1 introduction

it is now widely recognized that a chiral random matrix theory (chrmt) [1] is a use-
ful theoretical tool to describe non-perturbative aspects of qcd. like other complicated
quantum systems[2], statistical properties of qcd dirac operator show high universality
described by this model. a possible relation between chiral phase transition and anderson
localization transition (a metal-insulator transition induced by a random impurity poten-
tial) 1, which was originally suggested in the context of an instanton liquid model[3, 4],
is currently under intensive study.

in order to discuss such relations, however, the original model is not appropriate be-
cause the model lacks space-time coordinate dependence and can only describe a metallic
region. in this region, energy eigenfunctions extend over the whole system. the corre-
lations of energy levels are very large and can be correctly described by rmt. but, if
impurity potential becomes strong, the wavefunction tends to localize. the correlations
become small and the diusion eects become important.

recently, some authors have discussed the limitation of the original model[6, 7]. com-
paring with numerical simulations, they found that the deviations from the results of the
original model could be seen beyond a certain energy scale[7, 8]. further there were some
analytical arguments supporting the above results[9, 10].

1there are some arguments that anderson transition can only happen in quenched theories (see e.g.

ref.[5])

1

this energy scale is termed thouless energy after a quantity with a similar role in
anderson problem. in anderson problem, thouless energy ec is dened as d/l2 where
d is a diusion constant and l is a system size. if energy scale we consider is much smaller
than ec, the spatial structure of a system can be ignored and we can use a random matrix
model with a proper symmetry as a good approximation to describe statistical properties
of a system. but once energy scale becomes comparable to or larger than ec, we can no
longer ignore the spatial dependence of the system.
the intuitive explanation of above results is as follows; since a typical distance of a
diusing particle with a diusion constant d during a time period t is dt, a time scale
in which a particle is diusing throughout a sample with linear dimension l is c = l2/d.
the corresponding energy scale, 1/c, is thouless energy. hence, when we consider times
much greater than c (or energies much smaller than ec), a particle has enough time to
wander everywhere in the sample and would nally forget from where it starts. then
every point in the sample becomes equivalent and the spatial structure of the original
system can be ignored.

besides the above intuitive reasoning, thouless energy also appears in expressions of
various statistical quantities in anderson problem. in the context of impurity perturbation
technique, thouless energy is dened as a rst excitation energy of fundamental diusion
modes, diuson. if all excitation energies of the modes with nite wave numbers are much
greater than the energy scale we consider, we can ignore contributions from these modes.
there remains the lowest mode with 0 wave number which is constant throughout the
sample. keeping only the lowest mode amounts to neglecting the spatial dependence.

turning to the statistical properties of qcd dirac operator, the authors of ref.[6, 7]
followed the above intuitive argument and suggested that thouless energy in qcd is
the right hand side of eq.(7). hence if relevant energy scale exceeds this quantity, we
should expect deviations from chrmt due to the eects of diusion modes. at present,
however, we do not know concrete expressions of these eects, which is necessary to make
the arguments quantitative.

in this paper, we aim to go beyond the qualitative argument and to calculate these
eects of diusion analytically. guided by a model used to describe disordered electrons in
metals[11], we extend the original chiral random matrix model; a single random matrix is
replaced by a set of mutually coupled random matrices each of which is localized in a nite
space-time region. this model is dened in section 2. partition function is calculated and
comparison with the nonlinear sigma model is made.

to calculate the level density in rmt, one usually use the orthogonal polynomial
in the present paper, we use the
method[12] or the supersymmetry method[13, 14].
supersymmetry method because this method is easy to handle the extended model. this
is formulated in section 3.

the averaged level density (section 4) and the two-point level correlation function
(section 5) are calculated perturbatively.
in comparison with the non-chiral rmt, we
conrm that the thouless energy in qcd is related to the pion decay constant as originally
suggested.

in section 6, we also calculate the two-point correlation functions which correspond
to meson propagators. we nd that a pion propagator derived in the present model
corresponds to a diuson propagator in anderson model. namely, pion mode plays the

2

role of diusion mode in disordered qcd vacuum.

2 chiral random matrix model

2.1 original chiral random matrix model

original chiral random matrix theory is dened as follows [1]. generally, euclidean dirac
operator matrix in gauge eld can be written as

h =   0 w
0 !

w 

=  

0

1 + i2

1  i2

0

!

(1)

where w is an n  n complex matrix and i is a real matrix. that is, we consider the
case of unitary ensemble which has the symmetry for fundamental fermions with three
colors. n goes to innity in the thermodynamic limit. matrix w depends on the gauge
eld and treated as random matrix. gauge eld path integral is replaced by gaussian
ensemble average[1] as

zrm t = z dw

nf

yf =1

det  mf

iw  mf ! exp(cid:18)

iw

n
2

2trw w (cid:19)

(2)

where mf are quark masses and  denotes chiral condensate. this function is expressed
by the integral of auxiliary eld u which is an nf  nf unitary matrix[1] as

zrm t = z du exp (n re tr (mqu)) .

(3)

this function is the same as the partition function of nonlinear sigma model without
space-time dependence,

zn ls = z [du] exp(cid:18)z d4xl(cid:19)

 z du exp (v  re tr (mqu))

f 2

4

l =

tr(cid:16)u (x)u(x)(cid:17)  re (tr mqu(x)) +   

(4)

(5)

(6)

where f is a pion decay constant. in the r.h.s. of the arrow, we ignore the space time
dependence of u(x). that is, chrmt is a zero dimensional theory.
in chrmt, we
focus our attention on quasi-zero mode levels of dirac operator. as long as we consider
these quasi-zero modes, we can use the partition function of chrmt without spatial
dependence. it is known that the microscopic spectral density whicn is the level density
of quasi-zero modes does not depend on the assumption of gaussian ensemble average
[15].

in nonlinear sigma model, the condition for the zero-momentum sector to dominate
is 1/m  l [16] where m is the pion mass and l is a system size. this condition

3

means pion compton wavelength is greater than the system size. when 1/m  l,
contributions from nonzero modes are important and we cannot neglect the kinetic term.
using gell-mannoakesrenner relation, this condition is written as follows

mq 

f 2
/2
l2

.

(7)

the authors of ref.[6, 7] suggested that thouless energy in qcd is the right hand side
quantity of eq.(7). if relevant energy scale exceeds thouless energy, we should expect
that the deviations from chrmt appear, just like the case of anderson model. this
diusion eects are discussed in anderson model[11]. we try to do the same thing in
qcd.

2.2 extended chiral random matrix model

we must introduce the parameter corresponding to the pion decay constant. to consider
spatial dependence, the random matrix w is replaced by a set of mutually coupled random
matrices as

(8)

w 

w1 v1l
. . .
. . .

v1l

0

. . .
. . .
v1l
v1l wn









where wi is an l  l random matrix and v is a coupling constant 2. label i means space-
time coordinate. coupling matrix v1l is chosen diagonal for simplicity. 1l denotes an l
dimensional unit matrix . eq.(8) is the expression for the one dimensional system. but we
can consider any dimensions. the size of one block matrix, l, represents internal degrees
of freedom. in anderson model, this size corresponds to an elastic scattering length.

janik et al. suggested that this size corresponds to the constituent quark mass[6].
in instanton liquid model, particularly in nite temperatures, the instantons and anti-
instantons forms molecules. a random matrix model motivated by this molecule formation
is discussed in ref.[18]. the size of these molecules can be considered l in the present
model.

a probability distribution of the random matrices is taken to be gaussian

and ai is an nf  nf matrix. this integral is evaluated with use of the saddle-point
approximation. the saddle-point manifold for v = 0 is ai = ui/ where ui is an nf  nf
unitary matrix. we obtain the partition function as follows

(14)

here, we set the lattice spacing a = 1. comparing eq.(13) with eq.(14), we nd the
coupling parameter v is related with the pion decay constant as

v2 =

f 2

22l2 .

(15)

in the original chrmt, the pion decay constant is treated as an innite quantity. we
note that v is small but f is a large number. this means l is a large number. in the
original model, the matrix size must be taken innity in order to get the universal results.
in the present case, the size of one block matrix l must be taken innity. on the other
hand, it is not necessary to take an innite limit of the number of the block n.

3 supersymmetry method

to calculate the level density, we use supersymmetry method[13, 14]. we use the nota-
tions and conventions in ref.[14]. by this method, calculation of ensemble average can
be performed easily. however at present this method cannot be applied for unquenched

5

calculation due to the presence of the fermion determinant. we use quenched approxima-
tion for this reason. in original chrmt, calculation using this method is performed by
the authors of ref.[19, 20, 21, 22, 23].
level density can be expressed as

(e) = 

1


im tr g(r)(e),

where the (retarded) green function is dened as

g(r)(e) =

1

.

e+  h

h is a 2nl  2nl matrix. this is derived from the generating function:

z(e, j) =

det(e+  h + j)
det(e+  h  j)

= z d exphi(e+  h  jk)i

k =   1

where  is the 4nl-component graded vector,

t = (cid:16)(+)t , ()t , (+)t , ()t(cid:17) .

(16)

(17)

(19)

(20)

in the above expression, () is the nl-component bosonic vector and () is the nl-
component fermionic vector,

t () = (cid:16)t

n ()(cid:17)

= (11(), . . . , 1l(), . . . , n1(), . . . , nl())

= (11(), . . . , 1l(), . . . , n1(), . . . , nl())

(21)

(22)

where the symbol  expresses the chiral structure of the matrix.
taking derivatives with respect to the external eld j, we can get the green function.
generating function is normalized to unity when j = 0 and it is easy to calculate the
ensemble average.

in eq.(1), chiral basis is used. we perform a unitary rotation as a matter of conve-

nience and get

h =   1 i2

i2 1 ! .

this basis is used in ref.[19]. we follow their way and notations.

where v is treated as a small parameter and expanded in a power series. the external
eld j is a diagonal matrix.

4 microscopic spectral density

4.1 saddle-point

we apply a saddle-point approximation to eq.(31). since parameter v is a small quantity,
we consider the saddle-point for v = 0. the saddle-point equation is

 q(i) +

1

e+z  q(i)

= 0.

for e  o(l0), the saddle-point manifold consists only of the single point

(32)

(33)

q(i) = z

where minus sign in front of the square root is chosen so that it is consistent with the
sign of the innitesimal imaginary part in e+. level density is expressed as follows

using the saddle-point approximation, we can get the familiar semicircle law

where  = /2nl.

for e  o(l1), saddle-point equation becomes

q2(i) = 1.

(34)

(35)

(36)

this is not a single point and we must perform the integration over the saddle-point
manifold.

to proceed further, we must parametrize the saddle-point manifold. in ref.[19], the 4 4
graded matrix q is parametrized as

q = t 1

0 (iz)t0
t0 =   (1 + t2)1/2

(1 + t2)1/2 ! ,
where 2  2 graded matrix t is given by

it

it

t =   a

(38)

(39)

(40)

we omit the indices i in q(i) for the sake of simplicity of expressions. here, a and b
are real bosonic variables and  and  are fermionic variables. ref.[19] uses a diagonal
parametrization of t,

t = ut0u1

t0 =   1

u = exp  0

in this parametrization, measure dq is calculated as

(44)

(45)

(46)

in diagonal parametrization, the measure dq is expressed compactly.

in the exact
calculation for the original chrmt, this parametrization is used. but we cannot do exact
calculation in the present case because we must treat all the nonzero modes. calculation
becomes very dicult and we must rely on perturbation. the expression of dq in the
form of eq.(44) is suitable for perturbative calculation.

the calculation is just a gaussian integral and can be performed easily with help of the
following identity for the arbitrary graded matrix a,b:

hhtrg at(x)bt(x)ii = (e; x, y)trg atrg b
hhtrg at(x)trg bt(x)ii = (e; x, y)trg ab,

where (e; x, y) is the fundamental propagator of this model,

h(e)i =

(56)

in this calculation, we treat the propagator as a small quantity because the pion decay
constant is a large quantity. this is correct for the nonzero modes but not correct for the
zero mode because the term dk2/ vanishes at k = 0. as a result, oscillations due to level
repulsion are not found. this is because we use the perturbation for all modes. hence,
for small energy regions, the above expression is no longer valid due to the divergence of
k = 0 mode at e = 0. in these regions there are general arguments that the microscopic
spectral density should take the universal form[10].

5 two-point level correlation function

two-point level correlation function is calculated in the same way. this function can be
derived from the ensemble average of the product of the generating functions as

w (e1, e2) = dtrg(r)(e1)trg(r)(e2)e

=

1
4

tr  

j (1)! tr  

j (2)!dz(e1, j (1))z(e2, j (2))e .

(57)

in chrmt, we have the following identity

trg(a)(e) = trg(r)(e).

(58)
here, g(a)(e) is the advanced green function. with use of this identity, the two-point
level correlation function is expressed as follows

h(e1)(e2)i = 

1

(2)2 [w (e1, e2) + w (e1, e2)

+ w (e1,e2) + w (e1,e2)] .

(59)

now let us turn to the calculation of w (e1, e2). the generating function is expressed

with use of graded matrices and vectors as

where

z(e1, j (1))z(e2, j (2)) = z d  exphi ( e  h  jk) i

the chiral rotation is due to the chiral structure of the matrix and the unitary rotation
is due to the calculation of the two-point level density. the former is the same as the
calculation of the one-point level density in section 4 and the latter is the same as the
calculation of the two-point level density in the standard (non-chiral) rmt.

we calculate the integral of eq.(68) perturbatively. the measure dq is separated into
the chiral part and unitary (two-point) part: dq = d(tch)d(tu). the chiral part is the
same as the previous section. jacobian of the unitary part is equal to unity if we take the
matrix elements of t12, t21 as the integral variables. then we get

where e = (e1 + e2)/2 and  = e1  e2. e-dependent terms are characteristic in
chrmt. comparing this expression with the usual (non-chiral) rmt, we conrm that

we can calculate number variance from the two-point level density. this is dened as

2(z) = z z/2

z/2

dxdy2 (h(e1)(e2)i  h(e1)i h(e2)i) ,

(77)

where x = e1/ and y = e2/. this is the measure of uctuations of the level number
in the nite level interval z.

integration is performed and we obtain

2(z) =

1

2 xk

ln 1 +

z2
4( d

k2)2! .

(78)

we note that the e-dependent terms and -dependent terms give the same contributions
to the number variance. eq.(75) does not treat the zero mode exactly. we expect,
however, that this approximation does not change the behavior of 2(z) drastically. this
is because it is known from the results of the usual rmt that what is missing in the
perturbative result of the two-point level density is the oscillating behavior of the exact
result and the integration in eq.(77) cancels these oscillations. taking the continuum
limit, we obtain

we nd that the number variance depends on the dimensionality of the system. this
is very dierent from the original chrmt where 2(z)  logz for large z. the similar
behavior is nd in ref.[24] for usual (non-chiral) rmt and interpreted as change from
level correlation of rmt to those of non-correlated energy levels (poisson statistics :
2(z)  z). this is consistent with intuitive discussion.

6 two-point correlation function

the spatial dependence, which we introduced into the original chrmt in this paper,
enables us to calculate the correlation between two spatial point. by formal replacement
of the energy e+ to im, the green function g(r)(e) becomes a quark propagator. the
ensemble average of a matrix element

g(r)(im; x, y, , ) = (cid:28)x, (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1

im  h(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

can be calculated from the generating function as

y, (cid:29)

hg(im; x, y, , )i =

1
2



jxy, hz(im, j)i .

(80)

(81)

the external eld j is not diagonal in this case. label x, y represents the position of
block matrices. label , represents the internal degrees of freedom which are described
and by random matrices. we get hg(im; x, y, , )i = 0 if |x  y| > l. this behavior
means the size l is a reciprocal of the constituent quark mass. this is consistent with the
discussion of the ref.[6].

we can also consider meson propagator in this model. this is the product of the

green functions and can be calculated from the generating function as

here, trace is taken over the chiral degrees of freedom. summation over , is taken
because this degrees of freedom is described by random matrices. eq.(82) corresponds to

here (im; k) is obtained from (e; k) by the replacement of e by im. the above
equation shows that (im; x, y) corresponds to the pion propagator. we nd that the
scalar propagator can be neglected by comparing with the pseudo scalar propagator.
pseudo-scalar mode is important. this is consistent with the ng theorem. as was shown
in section 2.2, the present model is equivalent to the nonlinear sigma model. hence it is
reasonable that the pion propagator appears as a fundamental ingredient in the calculation
of various correlation functions. the calculation of the two-point correlation function was
also done in ref.[9] with use of partially quenched chiral perturbation theory.

(e; x, y) is a propagator of the fundamental mode in the perturbative calculation.
in anderson problem, this mode is called diuson. eq.(86) shows the pion mode in qcd
plays the same role as the diuson mode in anderson model. the fundamental mode
appealing in the chiral perturbation theory, that is, pion, corresponds to the fundamental
mode appealing in the anderson model, diuson.

7 conclusions

in this paper, we examined the level correlations of qcd dirac operator. we introduced
the extended chiral random matrix model including the spatial dependence.

3we must insert the isospin matrix but this is irrelevant in this calculation.

15

first, we showed the partition function of this random matrix model is equivalent to
that of a nonlinear sigma model. this equivalence has been previously shown only for
the 0-dimensional case without spatial dependence. as far as we know, this is a rst
explicit derivation of nonlinear sigma model (with derivative terms) from the kind of
chiral random matrix models.

to calculate level statistics, we used supersymmetry method developed by efetov.
using the perturbative expansion, we got the expression of the level density and two-
point level correlation function.

comparing the expression of this function with the usual rmt, we conrm that the
thouless energy in qcd is ec = f 2
/2l2. number variance was calculated from the two-
point level correlation function and found to depend on the dimensionality of the system.
this is very dierent from the standard universal result and interpreted as change from
level correlation of rmt to those of non-correlated energy levels.

for the rst time, the correlation functions of pseudo-scalar type as well as scalar
type between two spatial points could be calculated for the chiral random matrix model.
the previous work with use of partially quenched chiral perturbation theory[9] only gives
the correlation function of pseudo-scalar type. the reason why scalr type correlation
function can be calculated in this work is that quark propagators can be dened for the
chiral random matirx model.

these functions demonstrate that the pion propagator is nothing but the diuson
propagator which is a fundamental mode responsible for diusion eects in anderson
model. namely, pion mode plays a role of diuson when we consider qcd vacuum as a
disordered medium. on the other hand, sigma-like mode does not appear as a fundamental
mode in this model.
