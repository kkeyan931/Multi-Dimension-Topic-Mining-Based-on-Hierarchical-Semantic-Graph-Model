abstract

the constraints implied by analyticity in two-dimensional factorised s-matrix the-
ories are reviewed. whenever the theory is not time-reversal invariant, it is argued
that the familiar condition of real analyticity for the s-matrix amplitudes has
to be superseded by a dierent one known as hermitian analyticity. examples
are provided of integrable quantum eld theories whose (diagonal) two-particle s-
matrix amplitudes are hermitian analytic but not real analytic. it is also shown
that hermitian analyticity is consistent with the bootstrap equations and that it
ensures the equivalence between the notion of unitarity in the quantum group ap-
proach to factorised s-matrices and the genuine unitarity of the s-matrix.

it is well known that the s-matrix of an integrable two-dimensional quantum eld
theory factorises into products of two-particle amplitudes. then, the property of fac-
torisation itself and the usual axioms of s-matrix theory constrain the allowed form of
the s-matrix to such an extent that it becomes possible to conjecture its form. namely,
consistency with factorisation translates into the yang baxter equation while, on gen-
eral grounds, it is assumed that the s-matrix exhibits unitarity, crossing symmetry,
analyticity, and satises the bootstrap equations [1] (for a nice recent review see [2]
and the references therein).

in addition to this, and especially when the s-matrix is diagonal, many works on
factorised s-matrices assume real analyticity. this means that two-particle amplitudes
are not only analytic functions of their arguments, but they take complex-conjugate values
at complex-conjugate points. however, this is not required by the usual s-matrix axioms.
the aim of this letter is to review the consequences of analyticity for two-dimensional
s-matrix amplitudes, and to serve as a reminder that real analyticity is not essential. in
the framework of s-matrix theory, it is just a special case of a general condition known
as hermitian analyticity [3] which is valid only when the theory happens to be time-
reversal symmetric. for the two-particle s-matrix amplitudes, we will deduce the form
of the hermitian analyticity constraints which are given by eq. (21) and constitute our
main result.

we provide several examples of diagonal s-matrices which are hermitian analytic
but not real analytic. all of them correspond to non-parity invariant integrable eld
theories. the simplest is a fermion model proposed by federbush in 1960 [4, 5]. the
others are dierent quantum eld theories associated with the non-abelian ane toda
equations recently constructed in [6, 7, 8]. in all these cases, the scattering amplitudes
between dierent particles are not real analytic.
instead, those amplitudes connected
through a parity transformation are related in such a way that real analyticity would be
satised if the theory becomes parity invariant. this unusual analyticity condition is just
a consequence of hermitian analyticity.

other cases where real analyticity is not satised arise in the quantum group approach
to factorised s-matrices [9] and, in particular, to (abelian) ane toda eld theories with
imaginary coupling constant [10, 11, 12]. there, the s-matrix is a quantum group r-
matrix times a real analytic scalar factor, which implies that those amplitudes whose
matrix structure is trivial are real analytic. in this approach, the relationship between
the analytic continuations of the dierent amplitudes is dictated by the properties of the
r-matrix and, in general, hermitian analyticity is not satised either.

at this point it is important to mention that, in the framework of standard s-matrix
theory where hermitian analyticity is formulated, the axiom of unitarity actually means
that the s-matrix is unitary: ss = 1.
in contrast, in the quantum group approach
the role of unitarity is played by another condition called r-matrix unitarity (ru). in
fact, takacs and watts have recently highlighted that some of the resulting s-matrices
are not unitary, which does not prevent them describing physically relevant (non-unitary)
models [13]. we will show that hermitian analyticity ensures that ru is equivalent to
physical unitarity without any extra requirements. in other words, hermitian analyticity
is a sucient condition to guarantee that a factorised s-matrix obtained through the
quantum group approach is unitary.

an excellent classical review of analyticity in s-matrix theory is provided by the book
of eden et al. [14], which will be our main reference in the following. analyticity is the

1

assumption that the physical s-matrix amplitudes are real boundary values of analytic
functions as a consequence of causality and the existence of macroscopic time. on top of
this, the unitarity equations are expected to evaluate the discontinuities of those analytic
functions across their normal-threshold cuts. this requires that the physical s- and s-
matrix amplitudes are opposite boundary values of the same analytic functions, which
states the property known as hermitian analyticity [3, 14].

let us consider a generic integrable theory whose spectrum consists of several de-
generate multiplets labelled by a set of nite dimensional vector spaces va, vb, . . . with
dierent masses ma, mb, . . .. particles in the same multiplet will be distinguished by a
avour index i and, for simplicity, we will assume that all these particles are bosonic.
since the theory is integrable, the only non-vanishing (connected) two-particle s-matrix
amplitudes are of the form

h~kak, ~kbl | s  1 | ~pai, ~pbj i = (2)2 (2)(pai + pbj  kak  kbl) i mab

ijkl ,

(1)

where |~pai, ~pbj i is the state of two particles with mass ma and mb, and momentum ~pai
and ~pbj :

|~pai, ~pbj i = a

ai(~pai) a

bj (~pbj )|0i .

(2)

lorentz invariance allows one to decompose the scattering amplitude into scalar and
pseudoscalar parts:

mab

ijkl = m ab

ijkl(s) + 4 p

aip

bj p ab

ijkl(s) ,

(3)

where m ab
only.

ijkl(s) and p ab

ijkl(s) are functions of the mandelstam variable s = (pai + pbj )2

ijkl and p ab

analyticity postulates that the scalar and pseudoscalar components of the scattering
amplitudes, m ab
ijkl, are boundary values of analytic functions. this means
that they can be continued to complex values of s, and that the resulting functions are
analytic. in this case, since the theory is integrable, they should exhibit only two cuts
along s  (ma + mb)2 and s  (ma  mb)2 on the real axis with square root branching
points, corresponding to the physical processes in the s- and t-channel, respectively. then,
the physical s-channel amplitudes are given by the limit onto the cut from the upper-half
complex s-plane,

m ab phys

ijkl

(s) = lim
0+

m ab

ijkl(s + i) ,

p ab phys

ijkl

(s) = lim
0+

p ab

ijkl(s + i) ,

(4)

which is the generalization of the well known feynmans i prescription in perturbation
theory.

hermitian analyticity goes one step beyond. it postulates that the physical s- and
s-matrix amplitudes are opposite boundary values of the same analytic functions, a
property that has been proved in perturbation theory [3], in potential theory [15], and
using s-matrix theory alone [16] (see [14] and the references therein). since

h~kak, ~kbl | s  1 | ~pai, ~pbj i = h~pai, ~pbj | s  1 | ~kak, ~kbli ,

this condition can be written as

hm ab phys

klij

(s)i

= lim
0+

m ab

ijkl(s  i) ,

2

(5)

(6)

and a similar equation for p ab
and m ab
g(z) = [f (z)], hermitian analyticity results in the following relationships:

ijkl(s)
klij(s) are analytic functions of s, and using that if f (z) is analytic so also is

ijkl. therefore, taking into account that both m ab

m ab

ijkl(s) = [m ab

klij(s)] ,

p ab
ijkl(s) = [p ab

klij(s)] .

(7)

an immediate and vital consequence of hermitian analyticity is that the unitarity equa-
tions ss = 1 evaluate the discontinuities of m ab
ijkl(s) across the two-
particle cuts [3, 17].

ijkl(s) and p ab

in two-dimensions, it is customary to use rapidities instead of momenta,

(p0

ai, ~pai) = (ma cosh ai , ma sinh ai) .

(8)

then, the (real) mandelstam variable s is a function of the absolute value of the rapidity
dierence of the colliding particles  = |ai  bj | > 0,

s = (pa + pb)2 = m2

a + m2

b + 2 ma mb cosh  ,

(9)

and the two-particle amplitudes become functions of . understood as complex variables,
the change of variables between s and  allows one to open the two cuts. hence, m ab
ijkl()
and p ab
ijkl() are meromorphic and the physical sheet is mapped into the region 0  im 
, which is the rst riemann sheet in the complex -plane.

regarding analyticity, notice that

lim
0+

m ab

ijkl(s  i) = m ab

ijkl() ,

 > 0 .

(10)

therefore, since the amplitudes are meromorphic functions of , the hermitian analyticity
relationships (7) translate into

m ab

ijkl() = [m ab

klij()] ,

p ab
ijkl() = [p ab

klij()] .

(11)

finally, let us consider the full s-matrix amplitude corresponding to (1):

h~kak, ~kbl | s | ~pai, ~pbj i = 4(2)2(ai  ak)(bj  bl) s ab

ijkl ,

(12)

where

s ab

ijkl = ikjl + i

mab

ijkl

4mamb sinh 

= ikjl + i  m ab

ijkl()

4mamb sinh 

+ p ab

ijkl() sign(ai  bj )! ,

and we have used that

4 p

aip

bj = 4mamb sinh(ai  bj ) = 4mamb sinh  sign(ai  bj ) ,

together with the standard relativistic normalization

h~pbj | ~paii = ab ij (2) 2p0

(15)

using the heaviside function (x) = 0 if x < 0 and = 1 if x > 0, eq. (13) can be

written as

where

s ab

ijkl = (ai  bj ) sab

sab

ij () = ikjl + i  m ab

ijkl()

is the scattering amplitude of the process where particle ai initially is on the left-hand
side of particle bj, while

sba

lk

ji() = ikjl + i  m ab

ijkl()

4mamb sinh 

 p ab

ijkl()! ,

(18)

is the amplitude of the process where ai initially is on the right-hand side of bj. these
amplitudes can be seen as the matrix elements of two maps [10]

sab() : va  vb  vb  va ,

sba() : vb  va  va  vb ,

(19)

where  is the rapidity dierence of the incoming particles. equivalently, in the sym-
bolic algebraic notation commonly used to describe two-dimensional factorised s-matrix
theories [1, 2], they correspond to

ai() bj() = xk,l
bj() ai() = xk,l

sab

kl

ij (  ) bl() ak() ,

sba

lk

ji(  ) ak() bl() .

(20)

the two-particle amplitudes sab

kl
ij and sba

lk
ji are analytic functions of . moreover,

taking into account (11), (17), and (18), they satisfy

sab

kl

ij () = hsba

ji

lk()i

(21)

which summarises hermitian analyticity in two-dimensional factorised s-matrix theories
and is our central result. eq. (21) means that the two maps dened in (19) are related
according to sab() = s

ba(), where the dagger stands for hermitian conjugation.

a direct consequence of (21) is that the scattering amplitudes will not be real analytic
functions unless they exhibit additional symmetry properties. to spell this out, recall the
behaviour of the two-particle s-matrix amplitudes with respect to parity (p) and time-
reversal (t) transformations:

p : sab

kl
ij ()  sba

lk
ji() ,

t : sab

kl
ij ()  sba

ji
lk() .

(22)

this shows that real analyticity is a special case of hermitian analyticity which is valid
only when the amplitude happens to be symmetric with respect to time-reversal trans-
formations, a conclusion that could have been anticipated on general grounds [14].

another important consequence of (21) concerns the formulation of the unitarity con-

dition. for real  > 0, the unitarity of the s-matrix, ss = 1, translates into

sab

xk,l

kl

ij ()hsab

kl

ij ()i

4

= ii jj  .

(23)

however, using the hermitian analyticity condition (21), unitarity can be equivalently
written as

sab

kl
ij () sba

j i
lk () = ii jj  ,

(24)

xk,l

which is nothing else than the condition of r-matrix unitarity (ru) that arises naturally
in the quantum group approach to factorised s-matrices [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. actually, to
be precise, ru is the analytic continuation of (24) to the complex -plane. therefore, we
conclude that there is no dierence between physical unitarity and the quantum group
inspired r-matrix unitarity if the s-matrix amplitudes exhibit hermitian analyticity.

in order to validate the hermitian analyticity condition given by eq. (21), it is necessary
kl
ij () has
to check whether it is preserved by the bootstrap equations. suppose that sab
a simple pole at  = iuc
ab on the physical strip corresponding to a bound state in the
multiplet vc. thus, its residue is provided by the projector of va  vb into vc  vb  va
and, near the pole, the amplitude will be of the form

sab

(25)

where, in the symbolic notation of [1, 2] already used in eq. (20), the coupling constants

in other words, ga

ij 6= h a

ji in general. eqs. (25) and (27) imply that, near the pole, the map sab() is of
the form

where p c
ab : va vb  vc is a projection operator. eq. (29) is explicitly consistent with
the hermitian analyticity condition and manifests that the poles in sab() and sba()
correspond to particles in the same multiplet vc.

the bootstrap equations express the fact that there is no dierence whether the scat-
tering process with any particle in, say, vd occurs before or after the fusion of particles ai
and bj into particle c a. in our case, using eqs. (26) and (28), this condition allows one to
write four dierent but equivalent expressions for the scattering amplitudes involving the
particles in vc and vd. for our purposes, it will be enough to consider only the following

it is worth noticing that the hermitian analyticity constraints given by eq. (21) cannot

(34)

therefore, given a set of two-particle scattering amplitudes, a sucient condition to ensure
that there is a basis where they are hermitian analytic is that there exists two matrices
ma and mb of the form given by eq. (34) such that the constraints (33) hold. notice
that, ma and mb are hermitian positive denite matrices for real values of . we will
refer to this condition as weak hermitian analyticity, thus making reference to the fact
that it generalizes a condition found by liguori, mintchev and rossi in the context of
kl
ij () for real values of  provide the
exchange algebras [18]. there, the amplitudes sab

6

exchange factors, and weak hermitian analyticity arises as a sucient condition to allow
the construction of a unitary scattering operator in a fock representation of the algebra.
in the rest of the letter, we provide several examples of diagonal s-matrix theories
where hermitian analyticity holds but real analyticity is not satised. in all these cases
the multiplets are not degenerate and, hence, no avour indices are needed. then, the
hermitian analyticity condition (21) simplies to

sab() = hsba()i

.

(35)

it is worth noticing that, in the diagonal case, the p and t transformations of the s-
matrix amplitudes are identical. this explains why all our examples involve non-parity
invariant theories.

our rst example will be the federbush model [4], which was studied in great detail,
among others, by schroer, truong, and weisz [5]. the federbush model describes two
massive dirac elds i and ii whose interaction lagrangian is

lfm =  2  j 

i j 

ii ,

(36)

i and j 

where j 
ii are the conserved vector currents of the dirac elds. the two-particle
s-matrix amplitudes of the federbush model are particularly simple and can be written
as [5]

si,i() = sii,ii() = 1 ,

si,ii() = e 2i ,

sii,i() = e +2i .

(37)

since they are given just by rapidity independent phase factors, the amplitudes si,ii and
sii,i are clearly not real analytic. however, it is straightforward to check that they
satisfy eq. (35) or, in other words, that the s-matrix of the federbush model is hermitian
analytic.

the second example is provided by the integrable perturbation of the so(3)k wess-
zumino-witten model discussed by brazhnikov in [8]. 2 the spectrum of stable funda-
mental (or basic) particles consists just of two particles  and  associated with the two
simple roots of su(2), the lie algebra of so(3), whose mass can be taken to be dierent.
the two-particle scattering amplitude for  and  has been calculated at tree-level in [8]
and, properly normalized, the result is

s() = 1 +

2i

k sinh(  0)

+    = [s()] ,

(38)

where 0 is a non-vanishing real constant whose value depends on the coupling constants
of the model. these tree-level amplitudes are not real analytic but, on the contrary, they
satisfy the hermitian analyticity condition eq. (35).

as our last example, let us consider the homogenous sine-gordon (hsg) theories
constructed in [6]. there is a hsg theory for each simple compact lie group g that
corresponds to an integrable perturbation of the conformal eld theory (cft) associated
with the coset gk/u(1)rg, where rg is the rank of g, or, equivalently, of the theory of
level-k g-parafermions [7]. the semiclassical spectrum of stable particles of the hsg

2using the construction of ref. [6], the model of brazhnikov can be described as a symmetric space
sine-gordon (sssg) theory associated with the compact type-i symmetric space su (3)/so(3), and it is
expected that many other sssg theories exhibit similar properties.

theories has been obtained in [19]. if the group g is simply laced, the spectrum consists
of k  1 particles for each simple root ~i of g, the lie algebra of g, whose masses are
given by

m~i(n) =

k


k (cid:19) ,
m~i sin(cid:18) n

i = 1, . . . , rg ,

n = 1, . . . , k  1 .

(39)

in this equation,

m~i = 2mq(~i  ~+) (~i  ~) ,

(40)
the constant m is the only dimensionful parameter of the theory, and ~ are continuous
vector coupling constants taking values in the fundamental weyl chamber of the cartan
subalgebra of g. for a generic choice of ~, all these masses will be dierent, and an exact
diagonal s-matrix for these theories has been recently proposed [20]. for our purposes,
it will be enough to quote the result for g = su(3). for the fundamental particles,
corresponding to n = 1 in (39), the two-particle amplitudes can be written as

s~j ,~j () =

sinh 1
sinh 1

2 ( + 2
2(  2

,

j = 1, 2 ,

s~1,~2() = e 

k i sinh 1
sinh 1

2(    
2(   + 

k i)
k i)

= [s~2,~1()] ,

(41)

where the value of the real parameter  depends on the coupling constants ~, and 
can be taken to be +1 or 1. eq. (41) provides a set of diagonal two-particle s-matrix
amplitudes that satisfy unitarity, crossing symmetry, and the bootstrap equations [20].
however, they are hermitian analytic and not real analytic.

to sum up, our main point was to recall that real analyticity is not essential in s-
matrix theory; it is just a special case of a general property called hermitian analyticity.
then, we have derived the constraints implied by hermitian analyticity for the two-
particle scattering amplitudes in two-dimensional factorised s-matrix theories, which are
summarised by eq. (21). these constraints are consistent with the bootstrap equations
and agree with the properties of the scattering amplitudes of several non-parity invariant
theories whose s-matrix is diagonal already discussed in the literature [4, 5, 8, 20]. in
addition, they also manifest that real analyticity is recovered only for those amplitudes
which are time-reversal invariant.

an important consequence of hermitian analyticity is that it ensures the equivalence
between the genuine unitarity of the s-matrix and the condition of unitarity satised
by the s-matrices derived from the quantum group construction of refs. [9, 10, 11, 12].
in this construction, the s-matrix is a quantum group r-matrix times a real analytic
scalar factor, and the relationship between the analytic continuations of the dierent
amplitudes is dictated by the properties of the r-matrix. as an example, using the results
of gandenberger in [12], one can check that all the s-matrix amplitudes corresponding to
the ane toda eld theory associated with a(1)
2

satisfy 3

sab

(42)

3i thank gustav delius for providing a proof that this relationship will hold for other ane toda
theories. when the quantum parameter q is a pure phase, it follows from the fact that complex conjugation
replaces q by q1, which exchanges the two sides in the quantum coproduct, together with the time-
reversal invariance of the r-matrices and the real analyticity of the scalar factor (see [10]).

instead of (21). this shows that the amplitudes with a trivial matrix structure will be
real analytic, but hermitian analyticity will not be satised unless the s-matrix exhibits
additional symmetry properties, like parity invariance if (42) holds. all this results in the
non-unitarity of these s-matrices reported in [13].

in the same article, takacs and watts pointed out the possibility that some of these s-
matrices could be conjugate to unitary matrices by means of a rapidity-dependent change
of basis of the one-particle states. however, they found rather dicult to check it directly
and proposed to investigate instead if the two- and three-particle s-matrices have pure
phase eigenvalues, which is a necessary condition. following this method, they have sin-
gled out a number of s-matrix theories where such changes of basis should exist [13, 21].
concerning this, we have obtained a sucient condition for the existence of a basis where
hermitian analyticity is satised; we call it weak hermitian analyticity, and it is sum-
marized by eqs. (33) and (34). it would be interesting to use weak hermitian analyticity
to characterise those s-matrix theories that become unitarity in some particular basis
and, in any case, to investigate the physical meaning of such basis.
