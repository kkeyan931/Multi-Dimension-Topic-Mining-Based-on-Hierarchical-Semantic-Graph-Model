abstract

we reconsider the problem of brst quantization of a mechanics with innitely
reducible rst class constraints. following an earlier recipe [phys. lett. b381
105 (1996)], the original phase space is extended by purely auxiliary variables, the
constraint set in the enlarged space being rst stage of reducibility. the brst
charge involving only a nite number of ghost variables is explicitly constructed.

the problem of innitely reducible rst
class constraints originated from the super-
string theory where a fully satisfactory co-
variant quantization seems to be an unsolved
problem yet. taking a simpler mechanics
analogue in four dimensions these look like

p2 = 0, (pnpn)  = 0, (np pn) = 0, (1)

where (pn, p, p  ) are momenta conjugate
to the variables parametrizing the conven-
tional r4|4 superspace (xn, ,  ) and n
 
are the pauli matrices. owing to the null
vector pn entering the problem, only half
of the fermionic constraints is linearly in-
dependent. in particular, the identity

(pnpn) z1

 + z1

p2  0,

(2)

 = (npn) , z1

, holds.
where z1
on the constraint surface not all of the func-
tions z1

 prove to be independent

 = p

z1

z2   0, z2  = (npn) .

(3)

apparently, this process can be continued,
the system at hand being innite stage of re-
ducibility [1]. it is worth mentioning that,
although the correct counting of degrees of
freedom can be achieved in the course of
brst quantization by making use of eu-
lers regularization [2], the expression for
the brst charge involves an innite ghost
tower [3] and, hence, looks formal.

a recipe how to supplement innitely re-
ducible rst class constraints up to a con-
straint system of nite stage of reducibility
has been proposed recently [4].
it suces
to extend the original phase space by the
purely auxiliary variables (n, pm),(, p),
), with  being a real boson and
(  , p 
(, ) a pair of complex conjugate fermions.
these are required to satisfy the reducible
constraints like those in eq. (1) (one can
check that the number and the class of the

2

constraints is just enough to suppress dy-
namics in the sector [4])

p = 0,

(nn)  = 0,

p   = 0,

(n n) = 0,

pn = 0, 2 = 0,

1  p = 0.

beautifully enough, in the extended phase
space the reducibility of the original con-
straints (1) can be compensated by that com-
ing from the sector of additional variables
to put the fermionic constraints in the irre-
ducible form

   (pnpn + pnn)  = 0,

  (pnnp  + nnp ) = 0,
   (nn + pnpn)  = 0,

  (nn  + pnnp ) = 0,
while in the bosonic sector one has

p2 = 0,

the equivalence to the initial constraint set
seems to be more transparent if one makes
use of the identity

and its complex conjugate. in the new ba-
sis the constraints (7),(8),(11), (12) are rst
class, whereas eqs. (9),(10) and (13) involve
second class ones. in order to explicitly de-
couple pn
 = 0 from the second class fermionic
constraints it suces to redene them like
2 p mn pm
pn
 = 0  pn
= 0. as the dirac bracket associated with

the second class constraints is introduced,
this seems to be inessential here.

residual reducibility proves to fall in the
bosonic sector. due to the identities (in
what follows the symbol  denotes an equal-
ity up to a linear combination of second class
constraints)

p  0,

pp  0,

(15)

there are only two linearly independent com-
ponents entering eq. (12), the system in the
extended phase space being rst stage of re-
ducibility.

it is the purpose of the present letter to
explicitly construct the brst charge asso-
ciated with the constraint set (7)(13), thus
giving an ecient way to cure the innite
ghost tower problem intrinsic to the origi-
nal system (1).

according to the general recipe [1] the
nilpotency equation to determine the brst
charge should be solved under the dirac bra-
cket associated to the second class constraints.
evaluated in specic coordinate sectors this
reads (only the brackets to be used below
are explicitly given here)

plus complex conjugate expressions for the
pairs ( , p ),(, p ).

in the cross sectors the only non vanish-
ing brackets are (in what follows we will not
need the explicit form of the brackets involv-
ing xnvariable, these are omitted here)

plus complex conjugates.

given the dirac bracket, the algebra of
the rst class constraints is easy to evaluate

and un 
noting also is the orthogonality of the struc-
ture functions obtained to the vectors pn, n
which holds on the second class constraints
surface.

having evaluated the structure functions,
we are now in a position to construct the

brst charge. associated with the rst class
constraints (7),(8),(11),(12) are the primary
ghosts (minimal sector) (c , p ), (c , p),
(c, p),(c n, pn). these have the standard
properties

with

 pk(npm  mpn),
nmpm  0,

(29)

(c a) = ( p a) = a + 1,
gh(c a) = gh( p a) = 1.

(23)

to compensate the overcounting in the sec-
tor (c n, pn) (only two components enter-
ing eq. (12) are linearly independent) one
further introduces the secondary ghosts [1]
(c 1, p 1), (c 2, p 2), these obeying
(c 1,2) = ( p 1,2) = 0,
gh(c 1,2) = gh( p 1,2) = 2.

(24)

the nilpotency equation on the brst charge

{min, min}  0,

(25)

should then be solved under the boundary
condition

min = c  +  c  + pnc n + p2c
(26)

+ pnnc 1 + pnpnc 2 + . . . ,

which, through (25), automatically gener-
ates both the algebra (21) and the identi-
ties (15).

calculating the contribution of the bound-

ary terms into the equation (25)

(unm

(27)

one can partially clarify the structure of the
terms lacking in eq. (26). in particular, ex-
tending the ansatz (26) by the three new
terms

one can get rid of the rst term (which is
a manifestation of reducibility of the con-
strains) and those involving p, ,

in order to verify eq. (30) a number of ja-
cobi identities associated to the constraint
algebra (21) should be used. these are omit-
ted here.

it is instructive then to give the explicit
form of the terms quadratic in the structure
 
functions which enter eq. (30) (um

is nilpotent. beautifully enough, only a -
nite number of ghost generations proved to
be needed in the extended phase space.

finally, it is worth mentioning that an
alternative approach to attack the problem
is to make use of lorentz harmonics [5] in or-
der to extract the linearly independent com-
ponents from the fermionic constraints (1)
in a covariant way (see also ref. [6]). hav-
ing obtained a system of rank two, our re-
sult here correlates well with that of ref. [5].
the present formulation, however, has the
advantage that all the variables involved obey
the standard spinstatistic relations. fur-
thermore, the scheme outlined in this arti-
cle proves to admit a lagrangian formula-
tion [4],[7], the latter seems to be problem-
atic in the approach [5].
