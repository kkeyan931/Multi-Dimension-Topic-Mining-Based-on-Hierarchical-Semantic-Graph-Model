abstract: we show that the fully covariant equations of motion for the m-
theory vebrane can be interpreted as charge conservation equations. the as-
sociated charges induce shift-symmetries of the scalar, spinor and gauge-elds
of the vebrane, so allowing an interpretation of all these elds as goldstone
elds. we also nd that the vebrane possesses a new symmetry that is part
of the gl(32) automorphism group of the eleven dimensional supersymmetry
algebra.

in this paper we give a new interpretation to the vebrane equations of motion. we show that these
can be written as conservation equations for three conserved currents. the symmetries generated by
the associated charges correspond to constant shifts of the scalar, spinor and gauge-elds respectively.
we then compute the algebra generated by these charges. this turns out to be  as expected 
the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra with two-form and ve-form central charges present.
hence in this manner we have reconstructed the eleven dimensional supersymmetry from the ve-
brane equations of motion. this superalgebra has previously been derived [8] in the context of the
lagrangian formulation of the vebrane. by reducing the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra,
we nd the (2,0) worldvolume supersymmetry algebra. the currents that give rise to this worldvolume
superalgebra are explicitly constructed.

we also nd that the vebrane contains a new symmetry that is part of the gl(32) automorphism
group of the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra. this symmetry rotates the vebrane and
twobrane into each other. finally, we discuss some of the possible consequences for m theory of this
new symmetry.

1 conserved currents and the equations of motion

the vebrane-equations of motion for a at background and ignoring higher order terms in the fermion
elds are given by [6]

gmnmnx a = 0,
m(1  )nmmn = 0,
gmnmhnpq = 0.

(1)

(2)

(3)

we will now dene the symbols occurring in the equations of motion: our index-convention is to
use m, n, p, . . . = 0, 1, . . . , 5 and a, b, c, . . . = 0, 1, . . . , 5 for world-volume world and tangent indices
respectively. for the at target-space indices we use a, b, c, . . . = 0, 1, . . . , 10. in static gauge the target-
indices can be decomposed into world-volume and transverse indices as a = (a, a). for fermionic
indices it is customary to use same scheme with greek letters, however we are going to suppress
these indices in most of the following for simplicity. we will use the mostly plus convention for the
minkowski-metric ab := diag(1, 1, . . . , 1) and normalize the -tensor as 012345 = 1.

the metric on the brane is the pullback of the at target space metric

gmn := mx anx bab,

(4)

and the covariant derivative is dened with the levi-civita connection with respect to this metric.
we dene the associated vielbein in the standard way as

em

aen

bab := gmn.

(5)

it will be necessary to switch frequently between frames. to make life simpler we will therefore
normally suppress the vielbein-factors.

the tensor gmn is related to the induced metric via

where the matrix m is given in tangent frame as

gmn := (m2)mn,

the 3-form eld habc is self-dual

mab := ab  2ha

but it is not the curl of a two-form gauge eld.
it is related to the eld hmnp = 3[mbnp] which
appears in the equations of motion, but hmnp is not self-dual in the linear sense. the relationship
between the two elds is given by

finally the matrix  appearing in the equation of motion for the fermions is given by

it satises tr = 0 and 2 = 1 and hence gives rise to the projector 1
the original spinor space.

2 (1  ), projecting onto half of
the covariantly conserved energy-momentum tensor for this system is given by t mn = q1gmn

[2] where q = 1  2

3 kabkab. using this we can rewrite (1) as
1

0 = t mnmnx a = m(t mnnx a) =
we can interpret this as the condition that the current

g

x := gt mnnx a
j ma

m(gt mnnx a).

(11)

(12)

is conserved.

let us now turn to the equation of motion for the fermions. here we have to do a bit more work.

using m(q1mmn) = 0 [7] we can rewrite (2) as

0 = q1mmnm(1  )n
= m(q1mmn(1  )n)
=

1

m(gq1mmn(1  )n).

g

(13)

in the second step we used mmnm((1 )n) = 0. to see this rst note that mn = 0. this follows
from the fact that the curved m are constructed from the at 11-dimensional a as m = mx aa
and the covariant derivatives m are associated with the induced metric gmn = mx anx bab. it
remains to show that mmnm((h)n) = 0. we have, moving to tangent frame,

maba(h)b =

(14)

we have used the duality relation for the a matrices and in the last step also the equation of motion
for the self-dual eld-strength mabahbcd = 0 [6]. hence again we can identify a conserved current

j m

 := gq1mmn(1  )n,

(15)

where we suppressed the target-space spinor-indices. note that due to the presence of the projector
(1  ) we only get 16 independent currents.

analogously we can rewrite the tensor eld equation of motion (3) as

0 = t mnmhn

g
pq = q1gmnhn
in the last step we have used that t mnhn
to see this recall that gmn = (m2)mn and hmnp = (m1)m

pq = m(t mnhn

pq) =

1

m(gt mnhn

pq).

(16)

pq is totally anti-symmetric in m, p and q.
qhqnp. this gives

t m

nh npq = q1mm

nhnpq = h mpq,

3

(17)

where h mpq is the dual of hmpq from which the antisymmetry follows. again we can identify a
conserved current

j mnp
h

:= gt mqhq

np = g h mnp.

(18)

2

identifying the symmetries

having found three new conserved currents it is natural to ask what symmetries the associated charges
will generate. recall that given any current satisfying mj m = 0 we can dene an associated time-
independent charge

which will generate a symmetry transformation on some eld  via

q := z d5xj 0

 = {q, },

(19)

(20)

where {,} denotes the poisson bracket.
unfortunately within the covariant approach to the vebrane used here we do not have a lagrangian
for the vebrane elds. however, to identify the symmetries it will however be sucient to keep only
the lowest order terms in the currents and then use the free-eld poisson brackets. we denote these
lowest order currents by the same symbol the distinction between them and their complete form being
apparent from the context. the lowest order currents are given by

j ma
x = mx a,
j mnp
= hmnp,
h
j m
 = (1  )m.

the free-eld (equal time) poisson brackets are given by

{x a(x), 0x b(x)} = ab(x  x),

{(x), (x)} = (x  x),

{bij, h 0lk} = l

[ik

j](x  x).

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

some comments are in order regarding the last equation where we have used i, j, . . . to denote purely
spatial indices. since one does not have a simple free action for the self-dual gauge eld one can not
deduce its poisson bracket in the standard way. however, in what follows it will be sucient to adopt
the above poisson bracket for the linearized elds.

using the explicit poisson brackets and including constant parameters one readily checks

hence qx generates shifts of the scalar elds as expected. for the spinors we nd

{b qb

x, x a} = bz d5x{0x b, x a} = a.

{ q, } = (1  ),

(25)

(26)

again constant shifts. note that the occurrence of the projection operator implies that only half
the fermions are getting shifted; these are precisely the dynamical fermions appearing in the dirac
equation.

4

finally for the gauge eld we have

{apq qpq

h , bmn} = amn.

(27)

hence we nd that all the elds of the vebrane undergo shift symmetries and therefore the
vebrane itself can be interpreted as a goldstone object associated with the superalgebra of the above
generators. the way the symmetry generators arise from the equations of motion is also typical of the
goldstone phenomenon.

3 the eleven dimensional superalgebra

we now want to determine the algebra of the conserved charges using the currents with only their
lowest order terms. in this approximation the algebra has only one non-vanishing poisson bracket
which is given by

this is the standard 11-dimensional superalgebra with ve-form and two-form central charges present.
in the vebrane context it was rst given in [8] using the lagrangian formulation of the vebrane. we
can interpret this result to say that the presence of the vebrane generates the central charges of the
eleven dimensional superalgebra.

in deriving (28) we have used various algebraic properties of the matrices (h) and (0), these can

be found in [1], and also the following majorana-ip-identity

which can be derived using the standard properties of the at eleven dimensional a matrices.

4 the worldvolume superalgebra

having reconstructed the eleven dimensional superalgebra from the equations of motion for the ve-
brane we will now make contact with the (2,0) supersymmetry algebra living on the world-volume of
the ve brane. the vebrane breaks half of the supersymmetries of the background superspace and
its the worldvolume supersymmetry can be found from the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra
by taking half of the supersymmetry parameter to vanish, namely

under this truncation the term that contains the momentum becomes

 = (, 0).

where we have used the explicit eleven dimensional a matrices given in [3] to identify nonzero con-
tributions. the two central charge terms can be reduced in complete analogy and we nd, omitting
the supersymmetry parameters and using static gauge,

(33)

this is indeed the six-dimensional (2, 0) supersymmetry algebra [5] with one-form and three-form
central charges present. the internal symmetry group is u sp(4)  spin(5), and ij denotes the
associated antisymmetric invariant tensor. the weyl spinor indices , , . . . run from 1 to 4 as do the
internal spin(5) indices i, j, . . .. the -matrices arise as building blocks of the at eleven dimensional

(34)

we use m, n, p, . . . = 0, 1, . . . , 5 and a, b, c, . . . = 6, 7, . . . , 10 here to denote at indices. the basic
relations are

{m, n} := mn + nm = 2mn,

with m = m for m 6= 0 and 0 = 0 = 1. the antisymmetric product is dened as

and one also has the following duality relation

(35)

(36)

(37)

note that in the integral representation of the momentum (p m) we nd t mn  mn instead of
simply t mn; the additional term appears in the reduction of z5. recall that t mn reduces to mn
for a at static brane. however, from the point of view of the world-volume theory this is a vacuum
conguration and has to have zero energy in a supersymmetric theory. hence the tensor that appears
in the (p m) above is therefore the natural energy momentum tensor. note also that the one-form
central charge in six dimensions receives contributions from both the ve-form and the two-form charge
in eleven dimensions.

we now give the currents that generate the above worldvolume algebra. clearly, the current
j mnnp
associated with the gauge eld is a current associated with the worldvolume algebra. the
h
other currents, namely those associated with translations and supersymmetry transformations, can be
deduced from their eleven dimensional counter parts by choosing superstatic gauge and considering
only those components that lie in the worldvolume directions. one then can then verify that the
resulting current transform covariantly and are indeed conserved. for the translations we nd that in
static gauge we have

j mn

x = gt mppx n = gt mn.

(38)

which is indeed the conserved current that generates six dimensional translations [2].

6

in superstatic gauge the spinor  takes the form

 = (, 

).

(39)

the linearized six-dimensional supercurrent is given as a straightforward reduction of the eleven

dimensional one (15) as

(j m

 ) = ((nnx a

a 

1
3

hn1n2n3n1n2n3)m),

(40)

the full non-linear form of this current can be read o from the supersymmetry transformation

given in [2] and [4, 3].

it is straightforward to verify that these currents do indeed lead to generators that satisfy the

above worldvolume superalgebra.

5 automorphisms of superalgebras

let us consider a supersymmetry algebra of the form

{q, q} = z,

[q, z] = 0,

[z, z] = 0,

(41)

where z are grassmann even generators labelled by spinor indices. it is obviously symmetric in
these indices. clearly, such an algebra obeys the generalized super jacobi identities. let us assume
that the generators z form the most general symmetric matrix. expanding this matrix out in terms
of the relevant cliord algebra we nd that z contains a set of totally antisymmetric tensorial
generators which constitute the central charges including the momentum generator. this is the case
for both the eleven dimensional and the six dimensional superalgebras associated with the vebrane
equations of motion (1) to (3). clearly in the latter case one must take an appropriate index range for
the indices ,  . . .. the corresponding superalgebras in the iia and iib theories for which the z
form the most general matrix in ten dimensions are well known.

we now want to consider the automorphism group of such a superalgebra. let r be one of the
generators of this group. being grassmann even its commutator with the supercharges must be of the
form

[q, r] = m

q.

the super jacobi identities then imply that

[z, r] = m

z + m

z.

(42)

(43)

it is straightforward to verify that all the remaining super jacobi identities are satised provided the
matrices m form a representation of the lie algebra generated by the generators r.

clearly, the maximal automorphism group is gl(cd) where cd is the number of supercharges. the
precise properties of the matrices under complex conjugation being given by implementing the majo-
rana or other properties of the spinorial supercharge on the commutator relation of the supercharge
 and their commutator with the

commutator of the generators s with the supercharges is given by

[q, s] = (c 1)q + (c 1)q.

(45)

one can also consider the case where z is not the most general symmetric matrix. for example,
when it is of the form p a(a), implying that we are dealing with point particles only. then the
most general automorphism group is by denition the group spin(1, d  1). these are the generators
ra1a2 in the decomposition of equation (44).
including further central charges one nds a natural generalization of the spin group that takes

into account the presence of branes.
generalizations corresponding to removing various sets of central charges from the full possible set.

clearly the generators of the generalized spin group will rotate the central charges into one another.
as an example let us consider how a generator of gl(cd) rotates the central charges. to be concrete,
let us consider the eleven dimensional supersymmetry algebra of equation (28) and consider the eect
of the generators ra1a2a3  gl(32), not belonging to sp(32). one nds that

since the central charges are the topological charges for the corresponding branes [9] we must

conclude that the automorphism group must rotate the dierent branes into each other.

6 new brane symmetries

in this section we will show that at least a part of the generalised spin group, or automorphism group,
discussed in the previous section is realised as a symmetry of the vebrane equations of motion.
in particular we will nd the associated new current and nd the poisson bracket relations of its
generators with the central charges. for simplicity we will keep working with a at background and
also ignore terms of higher order in the fermions.

consider the following current

rmabc

3

2eee

mnpqrsnx apx bqx cbrs(cid:19)

where anti-symmetry in abc is assumed. to check that it is conserved recall the following facts

note that (47) can be rewritten as

m h mnp = 0,

hmnp = 3[mbnp].

(49)

from which conservation is obvious.

given this additional current we can use the same procedures as earlier and compute various
poisson brackets at lowest order. to make our notation less cumbersome we will use the same symbol
to denote the associated conserved charge.

we now calculate the commutators of the rabc

3 with the central terms. using the poisson brackets

of equations (24) we nd that

[pb1

z a2a3,

[zb1b2

za1a2a3b1b2

[zb1...b5

up to normalisation this is a contraction of the algebra of equation (46) obtained by scaling the
generators as follows

(50)

and letting e  0. it is conceivable that the contraction is the eect of our approximation and that
by carrying out the calculation for the full theory one may nd the commutation relations of the full
automorphism group.

7 conclusions

we have shown, in the context of the covariant equation of motion, that the vebrane possesses
symmetries that lead to the worldvolume supersymmetry algebra and the eleven dimensional super-
symmetry algebra. we have explicitly identied the corresponding currents by writing the equations
of motion as total derivatives. in addition to the obvious currents for translations and supersymmetry
we nd that there exists a conserved current associated with the second rank tensor gauge eld of the
vebrane. the generators of these currents lead to shift symmetries for all the elds of the vebrane
so allowing us to identify them as goldstone elds for these symmetries.

motivated by the observation that both eleven dimensional and worldvolume superalgebras asso-
ciated with the vebrane have central charges that constitute the most general symmetric matrix on
the right hand-side of the anti-commutator of two supercharges we show that the automorphism group
of such a generic superalgebra is gl(cd) where cd is the number of supercharges. this is the natural
generalisation of the spin group which occurs in point particle theories to a theory, such as m theory,
that possess branes as well as point particles. such an automorphism group must rotate the dierent
branes into one another and so is a generalisation of the previously known duality symmetries.

we show, at lowest order, that part of this automorphism group is realised as a new symmetry
of the vebrane equations of motion. at rst sight, it may appear as a puzzle that this new brane
rotating symmetry can be seen solely within the context of the vebrane. however, the vebrane
through its equations of motion can see many of the eects in the eleven dimensional superspace
including the presence of twobranes. indeed, the twobranes which intersect vebranes induce strings
on the vebrane whose charge is measured by the gauge eld of the vebrane. examining the new
current we nd that the gauge eld plays the central role in its construction consistent with its brane
rotating property.

as such, it is natural to speculate that the gl(32) automorphism group of the eleven dimensional
supersymmetry algebra, or a subgroup of it, is a symmetry of m theory when properly formulated. in-
corporating this symmetry would inevitably lead to a formulation in which the vebrane and twobrane
appeared on an equal footing. since the symmetry rotates the twobrane and the vebrane into each

9

other one may wonder if it is a hidden symmetry of the eleven dimensional supergravity that rotates
the corresponding brane solutions into one another. in the quantum theory the topological charges
of the branes obey a generalisation of the dirac quantization condition and so in the quantum theory
one should only attempt to incorporate the subalgebra of the automorphism group that preserves this
relation.

the new symmetries we have found are not just restricted to the branes of m theory, but by
reducing the vebrane to the d4 brane in ten dimensions and then using t duality we can extend it
to be relevant to all the branes in ten dimensions.

acknowledgment: we would like to thank neil lambert for helpful discussions. while this work
was being written up we learned from garry gibbons that he, jerome gauntlett, chris hull and paul
townsend were preparing a paper in which the automorphism group of superalgebras is considered
within the context of bps states and, in particular, those that preserve 3/4 supersymmetry.
