the ruijsenaars-schneider model in the

context of seiberg-witten theory

h.w.braden, a.marshakov, a.mironovk, a.morozov

the compactication of ve dimensional n = 2 susy yang-mills (ym) theory
onto a circle provides a four dimensional ym model with n = 4 susy. this super-
symmetry can be broken down to n = 2 if non-trivial boundary conditions in the
compact dimension, (x5 + r) = e2i(x5), are imposed on half of the elds. this
two-parameter (r, ) family of compactications includes as particular limits most
of the previously studied four dimensional n = 2 susy ym models with super-
multiplets in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. the nite-dimensional
integrable system associated to these theories via the seiberg-witten construction
is the generic elliptic ruijsenaars-schneider model.
in particular the perturba-
tive (weak coupling) limit is described by the trigonometric ruijsenaars-schneider
model.

1 introduction

seiberg-witten theory [1] provides a description of the eective low-energy actions of four
dimensional n = 2 susy yang-mills theories in terms of nite-dimensional integrable systems
[2, 3]. such a description has been extended to ve dimensional n = 2 susy theories [4, 5] with
one dimension compactied on a circle of radius r [4]. by starting with such a ve dimensional
model one may obtain four dimensional n = 2 susy models (with elds only in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group) by imposing non-trivial boundary conditions on half of the
elds:

(1)
if  = 0 one obtains n = 4 susy in four dimensions, but when  6= 2n this is explicitly broken
to n = 2. the low-energy mass spectrum of the four dimensional theory contains two towers
of kaluza-klein modes:

(x5 + r) = e2i(x5).

(pn

which spontaneously break the su(n) gauge symmetry down to the abelian one, u(1)n1.
note that tij(a)  2faiaj
are couplings of the eective low-energy abelian theory and they
depend on the choice of vacuum. such an explicit occurence of the bare coupling  is typical
of uv-nite ym theories which possess the highest possible supersymmetry, perhaps softly
broken.

now seiberg-witten theory (implicitly) provides exact expressions for the full non-perturbative

prepotential f (a) (i.e. with all the instantonic corrections included) via1

(6)

here ds is the generating 1-form on the spectral curve c of the associated one dimensional
integrable model, and ai, bi are the conjugate 1-cycles on c, ai  bj = ij. the parameters ai
may be considered as (some) moduli of the complex structures on c.

according to the proposal of [4], the prepotential (5) arising from this ve dimensional
theory may be associated with the elliptic ruijsenaars-schneider integrable model [7]. in various
double-scaling limits it reduces to well-studied systems:

(a) if r  0 (with nite ) the (nite) mass spectrum (2) reduces to a single point m = 0.
this is the standard four dimensional n = 2 susy ym model  the original and simplest
example of seiberg-witten theory [1]  associated with the periodic an1 toda chain for su(n)
[2] and with the appropriate periodic toda chain for other gauge groups [8]. in this situation
n = 2 susy in four dimensions is insucient to ensure uv-niteness, thus   i, but the
1 our conventions are to include a factor of 1/(2i) in the denition of h . thus h dz/z = 1.

phenomenon of dimensional transmutation occurs whereupon one substitutes the dimensionless
 by the new dimensionful parameter n = e2i (/r)n .

(b) if r  0 and   mr for nite m, then uv niteness is preserved. the mass spectrum
(2) reduces to the two points m = 0 and m = m. this is the four dimensional ym model
with n = 4 susy softly broken to n = 2. the associated nite-dimensional integrable system
[9, 10] is the elliptic calogero model [11, 12]. case (a) is then obtained from (b) by inosemtsevs
[13] double scaling limit when m  0,   i and n = mn e2i is xed.

(c) if r 6= 0 but   i the mass spectrum (2) reduces to a single kaluza-klein tower,
m = n/r, n  z. this compactication of the ve dimensional model has n = 1 susy
and is not uv-nite. here   i and   i, such that 2  n remains nite. the
corresponding integrable system [4] is the relativistic toda chain [14].

(d) finally, when r 6= 0 and  and  are both nite one distinguished case still remains:
 = /2.2 here only periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions occur in the compact
dimension. this is the case analysed in [15]. it is clearly special from both the point of view of
yang-mills theory and integrable systems.

the purpose of the present paper is to provide further details about the general ruijsenaars-
schneider prepotential (5) with arbitrary r and , as well as to show what is special about the
point  = /2. we shall mostly concentrate on the perturbative (weak coupling) limit   i
in contrast
(with r and  xed) when the instantonic corrections in (5) can be neglected.
with the well-studied cases (a) and (c) the perturbative limit for calogero and ruijsenaars-
schneider systems at rst sight appears non-trivial: here elliptic systems are reduced to their
trigonometric counterparts and the spectral curve appears complicated. as we shall show,
however, the spectral curve may be recast in rational form.3
in contrast to earlier works,
this characterisation of the curve enables us to give the rst calculation of the perturbative
prepotential. in the perturbative limit of case (d) we reobtain the curve considered in [15].

an outline of the paper is as follows. first we will briey review the basics of seiberg-witten
theory and the ruijsenaars-schneider model. these sections provide enough information to
make the paper self-contained, and we reference works that examine these topics more exten-
sively. our strategy is to calculate the third derivatives of the prepotential via information
about the spectral curves of the models. these curves are complicated, and section 4 of the
paper treats the case of su(2) as an illustrative example. after this we treat the case of general
su(n). one of our important results is that the spectral curves admit a nice separation of
variables in the perturbative limit, which allows for calculation.

2the case  = 0 of fully unbroken ve dimensional n = 2 supersymmetry is of course also distinguished, but
trivial: there is no evolution of eective couplings (renormalisation group ows) and the integrable system is
just that of n non-interacting (free) particles.
3 in [6, 16] the perturbative period matrix

was deduced from the elliptic case by ingenious yet tedious calculations, which did not make explicit use of the
fact that elliptic calogero model can be substituted by its trigonometric limit (the sutherland model).

2 basics of sw theory

a key feature relating sw theory and the theory of integrable systems and one still lacking
a complete explanation is the following: the families of spectral curves {c} arising from sw
theory are parameterized by the hamiltonians of an associated integrable system. for a given
group and model the genus of c is xed and our family of curves is a certain subspace (normally
of high codimension) in the moduli space of complex structures. an explicit parameterisation
of curves is provided with the help of lax operator of integrable system. for the group su(n)
this has the form of an n  n matrix4 l given on the bare spectral curve e, and

c :

detnn (i  l()) = 0.

(7)

the curve is an n-fold covering over e parameterized by the spectral parameter .

for ym theories which are uv-nite the bare curve is elliptic (a torus) with its own modulus
in
 and we choose a bare co-ordinate  so that d is a holomorphic dierential on e.
the double-scaling limits which lead to the uv-innite theories described above this modulus
disappears and is replaced by the dimensionful .
in this situation the bare spectral curve
degenerates into the doubly punctured riemann sphere with spectral parameter

w  e2i,

(8)

and d = 1
dw
w . the lax operators and integrable systems we encounter reect the dimension-
2i
ality of the underlying ym theories. for ve dimensional ym theories the lax operators are
group-like objects ( with integrable systems the ruijsenaars-schneider and relativistic toda
models) while for four dimensional theories they are algebra-like objects (with integrable
systems the calogero and ordinary toda chain). the generating 1-forms are then found to be

ds = r1 log d

for 5d models,

ds = d

for 4d models.

suppose we parameterize a bare curve that is elliptic by the algebraic equation,

y2 = x3  x2   x  .

(9)

(10)

2() we have that d = 2 dx
then with x = () + /3 and y =  1
periodic weierstrass -function with periods 2 and 2, and  = 
canonical equation

y . here () is the doubly
 [18, 19]. this satises the

()2 = 4(()  e1)(()  e2)(()  e3),

e1 + e2 + e3 = 0.

we remark that although the weierstrass function depends on two periods, the homogeneity
relation

4 there may also be other representations. for example, in terms of the 2 2 transfer matrix tn () of some

spin-chain model:

(tz|t, t) = t2(z|, )

such alternative representations are crucially important for the description of matter in the fundamental repre-
sentation of the gauge group [17]. the exact (duality) relation between these n  n and 2  2 representations
still remains obscure and is beyond the scope of the present paper.

det22 (f ()i  tn ()) = 0.

4

enables us to arbitrarily rescale one of these. our nal results are independent of such scaling
and this allows us to choose the real period to be  (that is  = /2). the perturbative limit
is then given by the imaginary period 2 becoming innite,   i. in this weak coupling
limit (without any double-scaling) the bare curve (10) becomes

y2 = x2(x  1).
sin2  , y  y =  cos 

(11)

then x  x  1/3 with x = 1
xx1.
throughout we will denote by hatted quantities those expressions depending on an elliptic
bare curve (such as x) while unhatted quantities will denote their degenerations in the  
i limit (such as x).

sin3  ,  = 1,  =  = 0 and d  dx

the variations of ds with respect to moduli are, by denition, holomorphic 1-forms on the
spectral curve. particular choices of coordinates for the moduli may have natural properties.
for example, if ai dened by (6) are chosen as coordinates on the moduli space, then

ds
ai

= di

(12)

are canonical 1-dierentials, hai dj = ij. when the prepotential satises the wdvv equations
this choice is equivalent to specifying a at structure [20, 21]. further the second derivatives
tij of the prepotential (5) with respect to these coordinates then form the period matrix of
c. an even simpler expression  the residue formula  exists for the variation of the period
matrix, that is for the third derivatives of f (a) (see, e.g. [6]):

for 5d models,

(13)

(14)

we remark that although d does not have zeroes on the bare spectral curve when it is a torus or
doubly punctured sphere, it does in general however possess them on the covering c. examples
of this will be given later in the paper.

3 basics of the ruijsenaars-schneider model

the ruijsenaars-schneider model is a remarkable completely integrable system whose various
limits include the (nite dimensional) toda and calogero-moser models. here we shall review
only a few of its salient features needed for our calculations. more comprehensive accounts of
its structure and applications may be found in [22]. the gl(n) model has an explicit lax
representation with lax operator [7, 23, 24]

(17)

(the nal product is taken to be unity in the case k = 1.) these hamiltonians arise in the
description of the spectral curve (7). the special functions that appear above are dened to be
[12]

f (q|) =

(q  )
(q)()

,

where () denotes the weierstrass -function [18, 19]. one identity used throughout is

(u  v)(u + v)

2(u)2(v)

= (v)  (u).

(18)

(19)

the integrability of the model depends on the functional equations satised by f [7]; the
connection with functional equations and integrable systems is part of a larger story [25].

some comment on the parameters  and  in these formulae is called for. here  is pre-
cisely the spectral parameter we have encountered in (7). further, the additional parameter
 in (15,16) above is the same parameter we introduced in (1) characterising the boundary
conditions. actually the integrability of (17) does not require  to be real, but such a choice
guarantees the reality of the the hamiltonians. the identication of these two parameters has
been simplied by our choice of the real period of  being  so that both (1) and (15,16) are
manifestly  periodic. the non-relativistic limit   0 which leads to the calogero-moser
system means we can identify the mass m = /r of the gauge multiplet with the calogero-moser
coupling constant. the special point  = /2 (= ) singled out earlier is now a half-period of
the -function, and at this point ( 

2 ) = 0.

from the point of view of classical integrability the overall normalisation factor c(|) of the
lax operator does not change the integrals of motion apart from scaling. this normalisation
factor does however lead to the rescaling of  and this eects the explicit form of the 1-form
ds.5 we shall see below that signicant simplications occur with the choice

c(|) = c0(|)

similar issues of normalisation enter into discussion of separation of variables [26].

for future reference it is convenient to record here the value of these expressions in the

2 sees

and the particular combination (20) becomes

c0(| = /2)  tan .

4 the case of su(2)

(23)

(24)

before generalising to the higher rank situation it is instructive to rst consider the case of
gauge group su(2). in the formulae of the previous section this corresponds to setting n = 2
and working in the center-of-mass frame p1 + p2 = 0. we dene p  p1 and q  q1  q2. having
constructed the spectral curve we shall proceed to calculate the third derivative of f (a), rst
directly, then via the residue formula. these will be seen to agree with those coming from (5).

4.1 spectral curve

using the explicit form of the lax operator the spectral curve (7) is found to be

2  cu + c2(()  ()) = 2  cu +

c2
c2
0

= 0,

where

is the hamiltonian (17). for the choice c(|) = c0(|) this simplies to yield

u  h1(p, q) = 2 cosh pq(q)  ()

or simply

2  uc0 + 1 = 0,

c1
0 () =

u

2 + 1

=

u

 + 1 .

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

observe that with our choice (20) this equation, which describes the seiberg-witten spectral
curve, may be expressed in the form.

u = h(log , ).

(29)

comparison with (9) shows that the generating dierential rds = log d takes the form pdq
here. this appears to be the case in all known examples [2]: the seiberg-witten generating
dierential takes the form pdq for the corresponding integrable system. a general proof of this
rather natural correspondence is still lacking.

upon using (24) we see that (28) reduces to

cot  =

u

2 + 1

7

(30)

at the special point  = /2 and in the perturbative limit. the rational spectral curve for this
situation was given in [15]6 as

w =

(  1)(  1
1 )
( + 1)( + 1
1 )

.

(31)

these two expressions are seen to agree upon setting w = e2i and iu = (1 + 1
1 ).

4.2 the period matrix in the perturbative limit

as we described in section 2, the derivatives of the 1-form ds with respect to the moduli are
holomorphic dierentials. a particular choice of coordinates for the moduli will lead to the
canonical holomorphic 1-dierentials. for the example at hand there is only one modulus and

 .

(33)

here k(q) is the complete elliptic integral of the rst kind. dividing dv by the right hand side
of this expression would then give us the canonical holomorphic 1-dierential d. similarly for
the b integral we have

dv =

ib

(34)

and so the period matrix is

d = ik

( u2

( u2

4 + ()  e2)(e1  e3) 
 .

(35)
one can take the limit   0 in this expression to obtain t =  . this agrees perfectly with
formula (5) for su(2) and justies our identication of the gauge theory coupling constant and
the modulus of the bare spectral curve.

let us now calculate the same quantities in the perturbative limit. now d  dx

()  sin2   1/3 and upon substituting 1/c2

0 = x  sin2  from (20) we obtain

xx1,

dv  (cid:18) 1
2r(cid:19)

dx

xq(x  1)(u 2  x)

,

(36)

sin2  + u2

with u 2 = 1

4 . we have e2 = e3 = 1/3 and e1 = 2/3 in this limit and so the a-period
in this case shrinks to a contour around x = 0. now ha dv = 1/(2iru) and we may identify

the canonical dierential d = 2irudv. this result also follows from (33) upon using

6this paper in fact used the slightly dierent normalisation w = 2e2i from that being used here and we

have compensated for this in the expressions being presented.

k(q) =

the b-period of d again gives the period matrix. the corresponding integral now goes (twice)

between x = 0 and x = 1, and the integralhb dv diverges logarithmically in the vicinity of x = 0.
this divergence was to be expected because the period matrix (5) contains a term  on the
right hand side and the perturbative limit is given by   i. upon making the rational
substitution x = v

1+v we obtain

t = ib

where  is a small-x cut-o. thus, the u dependent part of this integral is nite and can be
considered as the true perturbative correction, while the divergent part just renormalises the
bare classical coupling constant  . again the same result follows from (35) upon using

lim

ln(

the nal ingredient we wish are the a-variables, i.e. the a-period of ds itself. this will
correspond to the integral of (33) with respect to u, which is a rather complicated integral. for
our purposes the perturbative limit will suce when there are several simplications. from the
denition of (6) and that of ds we nd

a =

r i

now at x = 0 we have that c0 = i sin  while at the same time  + 1 = c0u. together these
yield

and

u 2 =

(38)

substituting this expression for u 2 into (37) we obtain for the nite part of the period matrix

(39)

upon using sin2 a  sin2 b = sin(a + b) sin(a  b) this yields precise agreement with (5) where
in the case of su(2) we note that only two terms contribute to the sum: one with a12 = a and
one with a21 = a.

4.3 the perturbative residue formula

we remark that the problems we encountered in the previous section of divergent integrals do
not arise when working with the derivatives of the period matrix with respect to its moduli
(i.e. with the third derivative of the prepotential). indeed the most eective way to deal with
perturbative prepotentials is to calculate them via residue formulae, which are nite. here we
will illustrate the residue formula (13) for the system at hand, reproducing the result (39) of
the previous subsection.

observe that although the expression for d is nonvanishing as a function of the bare spectral
parameter x (for nite x), it does however vanish as a function of the proper local parameter
2 at 2 = 1 (when x = u 2). that is d, while nonvanishing as a function of the bare spectral
curve, does vanish on its cover c.

this should be compared with the derivative of (39) with respect to a, that gives exactly the
same result.

5 the case of general su (n )

we now consider the general su(n) model. the rst step is to evaluate the spectral curve (7)
for the lax matrix (15). expanding the determinant about the diagonal yields

(45)

and ruijsenaars [7] expressed the determinants appearing here in terms of the hamiltonians (17)
by means of a generalised cauchy formula. here we shall reobtain this expansion using a simple
fact that generalised cauchy formulae can be derived in terms of free-fermion correlators via
wicks theorem for fermions. the ruijsenaars-schneider model (and its spin generalisations)
may be understood [24, 27] in terms of a reduction of the toda lattice hierarchy. the hirota

10

bilinear identities of that hierarchy may be expressed in terms of free-fermion correlators [28],
and are the origin of those here. we believe that these free eld expansions will ultimately lead
to a better eld theoretic understanding of the appearance of these integrable systems. the
machinery of free-fermion correlators has already found use, for example, in calculating within
the context of the whitham hierarchy for these integrable systems [29]. having obtained the
spectral curve we will then show that remarkable simplications occur for the parameterisation
of the curve, both in the perturbative limit and for the nonperturbative special point  =  =
/2. it is the existence of these simpler rational forms of the curves that enables us to calculate
the prepotential.

5.1 handling determinants

the determinants in (45) can be evaluated by making use of wicks theorem for fermionic
correlators on a riemann surface. (appendix a of [29] provides both a summary and references
for this machinery.) first observe that

f (qab|)
f (qab|)

=

(qa  qb  )()
(qa  qb  )() =

e(qa  qb  )
(qa  qb  )e(0) 

()(  )

()

.

(46)

here  is the odd theta-characteristic (such that (z) = (z), traditionally labelled 1 for
genus one), e =    and e(z) = (z + e). the symbol = denotes here equality modulo
standard factors like quadratic and linear exponents and dedekind functions, which will cancel
in the nal expressions. they may be simply restored upon using

(z) =

z2
2

e

2


1( z
2 )
1(0)

.

now the fermionic correlator on a torus is simply
e(  )

e(|) = h() ()ie =

e(, )

1

e(0)

=

1(0)

1(  )

e(  )
e(0) qdqd,

where e(, ) is the prime form. with  = qa and  = qb +  we see that the rst factor on the
right hand side of (46) is simply the fermionic correlator e(qa|qb + ) on the torus. further,
the multi-fermionic correlator also has a simple expression:

e(1, . . . , k|1, . . . , k) = h

k

ya=1

(a) (a)ie = qa<b e(a, b)e(a, b)

e(pa a pa a)

e(0)



qa,b e(a, b)

(47)

(48)

wicks theorem [30] expresses the fact that such a correlator has determinant form:

det(ab)e(a|b) = ()

k(k1)

2 e(1, . . . , k|1, . . . , k).

(in fact (47) (48) hold true for any genus, but here we only need them on the torus.)

we see then that (up to factors) the determinants det(ab)

f (qiaib|)
f (qiaib|) are the determinants of free
fermion correlators, which may be evaluated using (47) and (48). upon substituting a = qia,
a = qia +  and e =   , and collecting these factors we obtain the result of ruijsenaars [7]:

dik  det(ab)

f (qiaib|)
f (qiaib|)

k(k1)

2

= ()

k1(  )( + (k  1))

k()k(k1)()

2(qiaib)2()

( + qiaib)(  qiaib)

ya<b

,

(49)

11

where ik = {i1, . . . , ik} denotes the set of k indices and a, b = 1, ..., k. the right hand side of
this expression is in fact a doubly periodic function of all the arguments (qi,  and ) and so
may rewritten in terms of weierstrass functions. in particular, upon using (19), we nd that

2(qiaib)2()

( + qiaib)(  qiaib)

ya<b

= ya<b

1

(qiaib)  ())

,

(50)

thus recovering the hamiltonians (17) noted earlier.

5.2 spectral curve

upon substitution of (49) into (45) the ruijsenaars-schneider spectral curve takes the form

n

()nkck
xik
xk=0


epi1 +...+pik dik


n

xk=0

(51)

here we have collected the q-independent factors in (49) into dk where

dk(|) = ()

k(k1)

k1(  )( + (k  1))

k()k(k1)()

=

.

1
ck


( + (k  1))

(  )

.

k(k1)

2

(1)
k(k2)()

.

(52)

again this is doubly periodic function in both  and  and so is expressible in terms of the
weierstrass function and its derivative, though the explicit formulae are rather complicated.
although it may appear from the last expression in (52) that (51) simplies when c = c, such
a choice would break the double periodicity of our spectral curve and so is inappropriate for
the fully elliptic model. however, in the perturbative limit when one of the periods becomes
innite this choice is then available.

part of the diculty in dealing with the elliptic ruijsenaars-schneider and calogero-moser
models is the complicated nature of these spectral curves. for example, in the case of su(3)
the spectral curve (7) is

3  cu2 + c2v(()  ())+

()()  3()2() + 3() + 2()() + 2(() + ()) + 2(cid:19) = 0

u  h1 = h+, v  h2 = h

+c3(cid:18)1

2

where

h = ep1q(q12)  ()q(q13)  () + ep2q(q12)  ()q(q23)  ()+

+ep3q(q13)  ()q(q23)  (),

p1 + p2 + p3 = 0.

(53)

(54)

again the issue is whether some choice of the normalisation c might simplify matters. with our
choice of (20) for example, the third term in (53) turns into just v, but no drastic simplication
occurs in the constant term unless at the special point  = 
2 (where ( = /2) = 0) when 
modulo c  the whole equation becomes linear in x = ().

simplications do however take place in the perturbative limit which for our purposes suces
to establish the prepotential. in this limit we shall establish a convenient factorisation of our
curves. we note similar simplications were found in [16, 31] in the study of the trigonometric

12

limit of the elliptic calogero-moser models. indeed, in the perturbative limit and at the special
point  = /2, which was the context of [15], quite dramatic simplications occur. we shall
study this case rst, before turning to the case of general . before performing this analysis for
general n however, let us consider the simplications for the example of (53) given above.

in perturbative limit and at the special point  = /2 (53) turns into

for the choice c = c0. equivalently,

3 + v = (u2 + 1) tan 

tan  =

(2 + v)
u2 + 1

.

(55)

(56)

this may be readily compared with the rational spectral curve from [15]. to make this com-
parison more immediate, let us slightly change the choice of c: c = ic0. with this choice we
get

(57)

(58)

i tan  =

(2 + v)
u2 + 1

.

and should compare it with the curve from [15]:

w = 

(  1)(  2)(  3)
( + 1)( + 2)( + 3)

.

again, (57) is equivalent to (58) after the identication (8), w = e2i and with u = 1 +2 +3
and v = 12 + 23 + 31 = 123(cid:16)1

3 (cid:17), 123 = 1.

1 + 1

2 + 1

5.3 the special point  =  = /2

here we separately consider the special point where  equals the real half-period  = /2. we
shall see that simplications occur even before taking the perturbative limit. using the fact
that ( + 2) = ()e21(+) with 1 = () [18, 19], we nd that
()()
( + )  c+(|) = c0(|) = 2c(|)

(59)

with  = e1. then

dk(|) = ( ck

1

0 hk(k2)/2
0 hk(k2)/2
ck

k even,

k odd.

c0h1/2

1

(60)

here h1 = 2e2
1+e2e3 is independent of  and we note that in the trigonometric limit h1 = 1. the
choice c  c0 now essentially removes all -dependence in the spectral curve apart from a term
linear in c0 that multiplies the odd hamiltonians. similar to the su(3) case, we choose c = ic0.
by absorbing the (inessential) constant factors into the hamiltonians, hk = ikhk(k2)/2
hk for
1 hk(k2)/2
even k and hk = ik1h1/2
hk for odd k, one obtains the non-perturbative spectral
curve (51) at the special point  = :

even k hk()nk

p () + ()n p ()

(61)

13

where

hk()nk = n + . . . + 1

these formulae may also be easily expressed in terms of the jacobi elliptic functions. for
sn(u,k)
cn(u,k); here sn(u, k)

p () = xk
example, ()  () = (e1  e3) cn2(u,k)
and cn(u, k) are the jacobi functions [18, 19], u = (e1  e3)1/2, k is elliptic modulus.
we see then that substantial simplications occur at the special point  =  before even
considering the perturbative limit. now in the perturbative limit (z)  sin(z)ez2/6. using
this we easily obtain that

sn2(u,k) and, therefore, c0(|) =

5.4 the perturbative result for generic 

we nally turn to the case of generic  in the perturbative limit. the system in this limit is
described by the trigonometric ruijsenaars-schneider model. we have already seen that in this
limit -functions are proportional to sines with exponential factors. however, the periodicity
of our spectral curve means that these exponential factors must cancel amongst themselves.
for example we nd that in this limit

dk(|) =

(64)

(65)

is expressible in terms of the single function cot(  ). this simple observation enables us to
separate the variables  and  in the equation for the spectral curve upon choosing7 c = ieic.
with hk = hk/sink(k2)() we may simplify the spectral curve to give

transform dierently under        + 1 and        +  for

(this is because the ratios (+(k1))
dierent k.) the two notable exceptions are:

()

(i) the case of su (2), when the variables separated for the standard choice c = c0, see eq.(28);
(ii) the case of  = /2 (for any su (n )), when separation of variables survives non-perturbatively, see

eq.(61).

with

ds = log

(68)

thus, we have shown that our system leads in the perturbative limit to the rational spectral
curve (67) and the generating dierential (68). one may now calculate the corresponding
prepotential using the residue formula. this calculation has been done quite generally in [32],
where the residue formula is applied to a general rational function of the form

w  qnc
i (  i)
qqnf
 (  )

,

with i = e2ai, pi ai = 0,  = e2m. by choosing nc = n and nf = 2n, with the hypermulti-

plets masses pairwise coinciding and equal to ai +  we obtain our curve (67). one then nds
the prepotential from (3.37) of [32] gives the stated prepotential (3), and we are done. further,
upon setting  = /2 we reproduce the results of the previous subsection.

6 conclusion

in the context of seiberg-witten theory we have analysed some properties of the most gen-
eral compactication from ve dimensions to four dimensions with all of the elds belonging
to adjoint representation of the gauge group su(n). here seiberg-witten theory describes
the relevant low-energy eective action in terms of the nite-dimensional elliptic ruijsenaars-
schneider integrable model, of which the elliptic calogero, relativistic and ordinary toda chains
are particular limits. our work unies these previous treatments. special attention was devoted
to the perturbative (weak coupling) limit, when   i and the elliptic models degenerate
into trigonometric ones. two topics are still beyond this general model: compactication from
six dimensions and the inclusion of supermultiplets in the fundamental representation of the
gauge group. for both these cases the elliptic sklyanin (xyz) spin-chain model [33] seems to be
relevant (see arguments in [34, 32] and [17] respectively). in the present paper the ruijsenaars-
schneider model has been discussed with the help of an n  n lax operator and we did not
address the issue of a possible spin-chain-like description. this is an area warranting further
investigation. the most immediate diculty in extending this work to other groups is the
lack of a suitable lax formulation for general root systems, and we also highlight this as an
interesting problem.

another open question concerns the generalized wdvv equations [21]. at the special
point  = /2 these are known to hold [15], at least in the perturbative limit. equally, they
are known to fail [3, 6] for the perturbative limit of the elliptic calogero model, that is the
trigonometric calogero-sutherland system. this implies that there can be problems with the
naive wdvv equations for the ruijsenaars-schneider system under consideration, unless the
additional moduli  and  are cleverly taken into account. it may indeed be more illuminating
to consider the more general ruijsenaars-schneider setting rather than that of the calogero
system, especially given the result of [15] at  = /2. perhaps the most intriguing property of
these models is that perturbatively they are always described by the rational curves we have
exhibited in this paper. nevertheless, even at the perturbative level, the wdvv equations
have only been established at the special point  = /2. this issue deserves further analysis.
