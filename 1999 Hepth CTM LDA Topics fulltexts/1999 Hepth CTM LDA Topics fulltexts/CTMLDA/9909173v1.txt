abstract

in this paper we investigate massless scalar eld theory on non-degenerate algebraic

curves. the propagator is written in terms of the parameters appearing in the polynomial

dening the curve. this provides an alternative to the language of theta functions. the

main result is a derivation of the third kind dierential normalized in such a way that

its periods around the homology cycles are purely imaginary. all the physical correlation

functions of the scalar elds can be expressed in terms of this object. this paper contains

a detailed analysis of the techniques necessary to study eld theories on algebraic curves.

a simple expression of the scalar eld propagator is found in a particular case in which

the algebraic curves have zn internal symmetry and one of the elds is located at a branch

point.

1. introduction

in the last decade there has been a growing interest in the applications of algebraic

curves to several problems in theoretical physics, ranging from the theory of strings to

condensed matter physics [1][11]. algebraic curves, dened as the region in which a com-

plex polynomial of two variables vanishes, provide an explicit and useful representations of

riemann surfaces. thus, one can take advantage of well established results and theorems

of algebraic geometry [12][14]. so far, mainly applications involving curves with cyclic

monodromy group have been studied neglecting other, more interesting examples of alge-

braic curves. the reason is that computations on general algebraic curves are intrinsically

complicated. for instance, it is not known how to express the theta functions [12] in terms

of the parameters appearing in the polynomial which dene the curve. this is a great

handicap, since theta functions are the main building blocks in the construction of tensors

with given zeros and poles on riemann surfaces. other problems are connected with the

analytical continuation of multivalued functions on the complex plane. for example, any

attempt of setting up an operator formalism on algebraic curves based on the monodromy

of the elds [4],[15], leads to dierential equations of the riemann monodromy problem

type which are too dicult to be solved in practice. on the contrary, there exist several

ways to expand free conformal elds on a riemann surface using the formalism of theta

functions [16][24].

some progress in the physical applications of general algebraic curves can be obtained

by studying simple conformal eld theories. for example, the correlation functions of the
b  c systems have been explicitly computed by means of an operator formalism in [25]
[26]. the construction of a generalized laurent basis in order to expand meromorphic

tensors has been achieved in [26]. in the particular case of nonabelian monodromy groups

dn, n = 2, 3, 4, . . ., it is possible to show that these elements are connected to a riemann
monodromy problem [27]. the relations between free b  c systems on algebraic curves
and new conformal eld theories on the complex plane has been explored in [28],[29]. the
operator formalism of [26] has been extended to the    systems [30],[31] with integer
spins in ref. [32].

in this paper we study correlation functions of free massless scalar eld theory on alge-

braic curves. the form of the curve is restricted only by a requirement of non-degeneracy.

the problem is reduced to the computation of a dierential of the third kind normalized so

0

that its periods along the homology cycles are purely imaginary [13]. to this purpose, we

construct here a dierential of the third kind using the techniques developed in ref. [26].

its periods along the homology cycles are then xed by adding suitable linear combinations

of holomorphic dierentials. to pick up exactly the linear combination which makes all the

periods imaginary is however not a simple task. as a matter of fact, on general algebraic

curves it is not even known how to construct a basis of homology cycles. to overcome this

diculty, we exploit here a set of riemann bilinear identities [12], the derivation of which

is presented for a sake of completness in appendix a. these relations uniquely determine

the desired dierential of the third kind and provide an explicit expression for it in terms
of the parameters which characterize the curve3.

the material contained in this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we develop

the necessary techniques to study eld theories on algebraic curves. with respect to

ref.

[26], the curves are entirely general apart from the non-degeneracy. to simplify our

analysis, the dening polynomials are reduced to a canonical form introducing a set of

suitable transformations. the relevant dierentials like the weierstrass kernel and the

holomorphic dierentials are derived together with their divisors. the genus of the curve

is obtained from the number of holomorphic dierentials. this result is checked using a

bakers method [34].

in section 3 the theory of massless scalar eld theories is briey

reviewed following [35]. it is shown that all the correlation functions can be written in

terms of the canonical dierential of the third kind with purely imaginary periods around

the non-trivial monodromy cycles. this canonical dierential is constructed as a a linear

combination of weierstrass kernels and holomorphic dierentials. the coecients of the

linear combination are determined by means of a system of riemann bilinear equations,

which are satised if and only if the dierential of the third kind has purely imaginary

periods. the correlation functions of the scalar elds obtained in this way explicitly depend

on the parameters of the polynomial which denes the algebraic curve as desired. some

examples are worked out in section 4. the latter section contains also the derivation of the

massless scalar eld propagator on zn symmetric algebraic curves [4] supposing that one

of the scalar elds is located at a branch point. this particular case is of some relevance

in string theories as explained in ref. [8]. the riemann bilinear relations used in section 3

3 let us notice that similar methods, using integral identities like the riemann bilinear rela-
tions, have been already used in the computation of scalar green functions on hyperelliptic curves

[33].

1

are derived in appendix a, while in appendix b it is shown how integrals on an algebraic

curve can be rewritten as integrals of multivalued volume forms over the complex sphere

following [14]. finally, we discuss our results and their possible applications.

2. the language of algebraic curves

let c be the complex plane and cp1 the complex projective line which coincides with
the compactied complex plane c{}. we will describe riemann surfaces as nsheeted
branched covers of cp1 [14]. the latter are given as algebraic curves dened as the locus
of points (z, y)  cp1  cp1 for which the following equation is satised:

f (z, y) = 0

(2.1)

here f (z, y) denotes a polynomial of the form:

f (z, y) = pn(z)yn + pn1(z)yn1 + . . . + p1(z)y + p0(z) = 0

(2.2)

with ps(z) =

as,mzm for s = 0, . . . , n and ns  n. by a well known theorem, apart
from subtleties coming from singular points, any riemann surface can be expressed as an

ns

pm=0

algebraic curve of this kind. thus, from now on, we will use the words riemann surface,
nsheeted branched covers of cp1 and algebraic curves interchangeably. the best known
algebraic curves are the hyperelliptic curves, whose polynomials f (z, y) are simply given
by: f (z, y) = y2  p0(z). also the slightly more general zn symmetric curves will be often
mentioned here. they are characterized by f (z, y) = yn  p0(z).

one can solve eq.

(2.1) with respect to y and obtain in this way a function y(z)

which is multivalued on cp1.
its n branches are interchanged at a set of nbp branch
points ai, . . . , annp  cp1 as will be discussed below. in the following, the branches of
y(z) will be denoted with the symbol y()(z),  = 0, . . . , n  1 and the rst letters of the
greek alphabet will be used as branch indices. to simplify our analysis, we assume that

pn(z) = 1 in eq. (2.2). there is no loss of generality in this assumption. as a matter of
fact, if pn(z) 6= 1, one can always perform the change of variables

y(z) = y(z)pn(z)

(2.3)

which does not aect the monodromy properties of y(z), so that both y(z) and y(z) are

meromorphic functions on the same riemann surface. however, it is easy to realize that

2

y satises the equation pn

pni(z) = pni(z)p i1

i=0

pni(z)yni = 0, where now pn(z) = 1 as desired and

(z) for i = 1, . . . , n.

n

further, we require that none of the branch points is in z = . again, this condition
does not restrict the generality of our discussion as we will show below. first of all, the

presence of a branch point at innity can be detected investigating the fact that, for large

values of z, the function y(z) exhibits the following behavior:

y(z) 

z

czp + lower order terms

(2.4)

substituting eq. (2.4) in eq. (2.1) and solving the latter at the leading order in z, one
determines the allowed values of the constants c and p. a branch point at z =  is
indicated by noninteger solutions for p. if this is the case, it is always possible to perform

a sl(2, c) transformation in z, in such a way that the branch point at innity is moved

to a nite region of the plane. of course, the condition pn(z) = 1 does no longer hold in
the new variable, but it can be easily restored with the aid of the transformations (2.3)

in y. since the letter transformation does not aect the monodromy properties of y, the
branch point at z =  cannot be reintroduced.

we are now ready to study the nite branch points a1, . . . , anbp. supposing that the
curve (2.1) is nondegenerate4, they are the solutions of of the following system of equations:

f (z, y) = fy(z, y) = 0

(2.5)

where fy(z, y) = df (z, y)/dy. it is useful to eliminate from eq. (2.5) the variable y. as
an upshot, one obtains a polynomial equation in z of the kind r(z) = 0. apart from very

special curves, in which r(z) has multiple roots, its degree coincides with the number of

branch points nbp. let us notice that it is possible to derive the resultant r(z) of eqs.
(2.5) explicitly using the dialitic method of sylvester [36].

to each branch point ai one can associate an integer i, called the ramication index
and dened as the number of branches of y(z) that are exchanged at that branch point.
clearly, 2  i  n. at a branch point of ramication index i, the polynomial f (z, y)
vanishes together with its rst i  1 partial derivatives in y. the genus g of the riemann
surface (2.1) is related to the ramication indices of the branch points and the number of

sheets n composing the curve as follows (riemannhurwitz theorem):

2g  2 = 2n +

l

xs=1

(s  1)

(2.6)

4 see for instance ref. [14] for the denition of nondegeneracy.

3

the genus g can be explicitly computed once the form of the weierstrass polynomial is

known exploiting the bakers method, see ref.

[34]. this will be done at the end of this

section.

on a riemann surface g represented as an nsheeted cover of cp1 there is a canon-
ical complex structure inherited from cp1. a possible atlas on g is the following. let
us put r = max|ai| and  = min|ai  aj| for i, j = 1, . . . , nbp. near a branch point ai of
ramication index i, or more precisely in the open disk |z  ai| < , we choose the local
coordinate i = z  ai. for |z| > r, the local coordinate is z = 1/z. let us notice that
on the algebraic curve the set |z| > r corresponds to an union of n disjoint discs. on the
remaining open sets the local coordinate is z (the same letter z denotes here coordinates on

n dierent branches of g; this convention is very useful and, hopefully, does not generate

ambiguities).

in the rest of this section, we discuss the construction of the relevant meromorphic

tensors and the computation of their divisors. we are interested in tensors of the kind
t ()(z)dz, with  upper or lower indices depending on the sign of  = 0, 1, 2, . . .. the
treatment of tensors characterized by half-integer values of  is possible only on hyperellip-

tic curves and will not be considered here. the meromorphic functions correspond to the

case  = 0. the branch index  has been added to recall that a tensor t is multivalued
on cp1 due to its dependence on y(z). to any meromorphic tensor t dz with zeros at zr
of order kr and poles at ps of order ls, one can associate a divisor [t ] [12] :

[t ] =xr

krzr xs

lsps.

(2.7)

kr and ls are integers while zr and ps denote points on the algebraic curve the degree of

the divisor [t ] is dened as follows:

deg[t ] =xr

kr xs

ls.

the most general tensor on an algebraic curve is of the form:

t ()(z)dz = q(z, y()(z))

dz

[fy(z, y()(z))]

(2.8)

(2.9)

where q(z, y) is a rational function of z and y. the reason for which the factor
[fy(z, y()(z))] has been singled out in (2.9) will soon become clear. from eq. (2.9)
it is evident that, in order to construct tensors on an algebraic curve with poles and zeros

4

at given points, it is necessary to know the divisors of the basic building blocks dz, y

and f (z, y). this can be done quite explicitly for the general polynomials described by

eq. (2.2) if pn(z) = 1 and if there are no branch points at innity. we only need the
additional assumption that the polynomials p1(z) and p0(z) appearing in f (z, y) have
no roots in common. in this way, eq. (2.1) is approximated for small values of y by the
relation y  p0(z)/p1(z). therefore, the zeros q1, . . . , qn0 of y(z) occur for values of z
corresponding to the roots of p0(z). to study the behavior of y(z) at innity we try the
if we retain only the leading order terms of y(z) and of the
ansatz (2.4) in eq. (2.1).

polynomials ps(z) appearing in (2.2), then eq. (2.1) is approximated by:

cnzpn + . . . + as,nscszps+ns + . . . + a0,n0 zn0 = 0

(2.10)

since by assumption y(z) is not branched at innity, there should be n dierent solutions
for c that satisfy (2.10). clearly, this can be true only if the rst and last monomials cnzpn
and a0,n0zn0 entering in eq. (2.10) are growing with the same power of z near the point
z = , i. e. zpn  zn0 . moreover, all the other leading order monomials appearing in eq.
(2.10) must not contain higher order powers in z, i. e.:

ps + ns  n0

s = 1, . . . , n  1

thus, we obtain for p the following result:

p =

n0
n

= 1, 2, . . .

this implies that the integer n0 is a multiple of n.

in this way we have derived the divisor of y:

[y] =

n0

xr=1

qr 

n0
n j

n1

xj=0

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

the symbols j denote the points on the curve corresponding to the point z =  in cp1.
in the covering of the algebraic curve described above they belong to the n disjoint discs
where the condition |z| > r is satised. as we see from the above equation, the degree of
the divisor [y] is zero as expected for a meromorphic function. analogously, it is possible

to compute the divisors of fy(z, y) and dz:

[fy] =

nbp

xr=1

(r  1)ar  (n  1)

n0
n j

n1

xj=0

5

(2.14)

[dz] =

nbp

xr=1

(r  1)ar  2

n1

xj=0

j

(2.15)

the details are explained in ref. [26]. exploiting the above divisors, one is able to prove
that, if   2, the following tensor has only a simple pole at the point z = w on the sheet
 = :

k ()



(z, w)dz =

1

f (w, y()(z))

dz

z  w

[y()(z)  y()(w)]

[fy(z, y()(z))]

(2.16)

where the indices  nd  label the branches in z and w respectively. the tensor
k ()

(z, w)dz will be hereafter called the weierstrass kernel.



if  = 1, it is easy to

check that

()
uw

(z)dz = k ()

1

(z, u)dz  k ()

1

(z, w)dz

(2.17)

is a dierential of the third kind 5 with two simple poles in z = u and z = w on the sheets
 =  and  =  respectively. the residue of ()
(z)dz is +1 at z = u and 1 at
z = w. for our purposes we will also need dierentials of the rst kind, or holomorphic

uw

one forms and dierentials of the second kind, which consists of meromorphic one forms

with vanishing residue. any meromorphic dierential can be decomposed in terms of the

elements of a generalized laurent basis given by [25]:

fk,i(z)dz =

zi1yn1k(z)

fy(z, y(z))

dz

(cid:26) i = 0, 1, 2, . . .
k = 0, . . . , n  1

(2.18)

for the functions, instead, it is possible to use the following basis:

k,i(z) = zi(cid:0)yk(z) + yk1(z)pn1(z) + yk2(z)pn2(z) + . . . + pnk(z)(cid:1)

(2.19)

where k and i take the same values as in eq. (2.18). the elements of the basis (2.19) look

apparently complicated, yet they are very convenient in order to expand the dierentials

of the third kind (2.17). as a matter of fact, it is possible to show that [26]:

()
uw

(z)dz =

n1

xk=0

k,0(u)

f ()
k,1(z)()
z  u

dz 

n1

xk=0

k,0(w)

f ()
k,1(z)()
z  w

dz

(2.20)

5 following the classication of [37], here third kind dierentials are dened as meromorphic

dierentials with at most simple poles. this denition diers for instance from that of [12].

6

to construct a basis of holomorphic dierentials it is sucient to nd all possible

values of s and k in eq. (2.18) for which fk,s(z)dz has no poles. it is easy to check with
the help of eqs. (2.13)(2.15) that such a basis is given by:

(j,sj )(z)dz =

zsj yj(z)

fy(z, y(z))

dz

(2.21)

where, for p = 1, 2, . . .

j = 0, . . . , n  2  p,1

sj = 0, . . . , (n  1  j)p  2

p,1 =(cid:26) 1 if p = 1

0 if p > 1

(2.22)

the number of the above holomorphic dierentials coincides with the genus of the curve

(2.2). a straightforward computation gives:

g =

pn(n  1)  2(n  1)

2

(2.23)

the above calculation of g can be veried using the already mentioned method of baker.
to this purpose, let us consider a two dimensional integer lattice on the x  y plane. one
draws a triangle oac with vertices at the points o = (0, 0), a = (a, 0) and c = (0, b),

where a = n and b = pn. according to bakers method, the genus of the curve (2.2)

with the additional constraints (2.11)(2.12) and pn(z) = 1 coincides with the number
g of lattice points contained inside the area of this triangle, the boundary excluded. let

us evaluate g. first of all, one counts the number of lattice points t inside the rectangle

oabc, where b = (a, b), excluding also the boundary. then one subtracts the number
of links d lying on the diagonal ac. one nds that t = (pn  1)(n  1) and d = n  1.
clearly

g =

(2.24)

t  d

2

and it is easy to see that this gives for the genus of the curve (2.2) exactly the result of

eq. (2.23), i. e. g = g.

finally, a possible metric on the curve (2.2) is given by

ds2 = z zdzdz = (1 + zz)

dzdz

|fy(z, y)|2

 = p(n  1)  2

(2.25)

3. scalar green functions on algebraic curves

in this section we consider the free bosonic scalar eld theory described by the action:

s =zg

d2z 

7

(3.1)

dened on a general algebraic curves g discussed above. a conformal metric on g is
understood in (3.1) . moreover the d2z is a shorthand notation for 1

2i dzdz.

a scalar eld in the two dimensional eld theory (3.1) satises the poisson equation

can can be interpreted as an electrostatic potential of a coulomb system of charges. zdz

is a meromorhic dierential with the sum of residua at poles equal zero. consequently the

sum of charges on the riemann surface must be zero as well. thus we consider a system of

charges qi set in the positions zi, i = 1, . . . , m interacting with another system of charges
q
q
j = 0.

j located at the points wj , j = 1, . . . , n and satisfying the relations pi

the corresponding correlation function:

qi = pj

g(z1 . . . zm ; wi . . . wn ) =

m

n

xi=1

xj=1

qih(zi, zi)(wj, wj)iq

j

can be computed once the following green function is known:

gz(z; u, w) = hz(z, z) [(u, u)  (w, w)]i

as a matter of fact, one can prove the following relation:

(3.2)

(3.3)

g(z1 . . . zm ; wi . . . wn ) =

m

n

j re(cid:20)z zi

z0

dzhz(z, z) [(wj, wj)  (u, u)]i(cid:21) =

z0

1
2

m

n

xi=1

xj=1

qiq

(3.4)

(3.5)

moreover, once gz(z; u, w) is known, one obtains also the correlator

gzu(z; u) = hz(z, z)u(u, u)i

as can be seen by dierentiating both sides of equation (3.3) with respect to u. for these

reasons, we will limit ourselves to the computation of gz(z; u, w).

to simplify the notations, we introduce the composite indices i, j, k, . . .. with i =

(i, si), j = (j, sj) etc. for instance, in this notation i (z)dz = (i,si)(z)dz. it is now
possible to construct gz(z; u, w) starting from any third kind dierential with two poles at

z = u, w and adding to it a suitable linear combination of holomorphic dierentials. using

for example the third kind dierential dened in eq. (2.17), we have in general:

gz(z; u, w)dz = uw(z)dz +xi

8

bi (u, w)i(z)dz

(3.6)

following the strategy of [38], we try to determine the coecients bi (u, w) exploiting

the fact that the elds (z, z) are single-valued functions on g, so that they must obey

the relations:

is

d =is

zdz +is

zdz = 0

(3.7)

where the s, s = 1, . . . , 2g, form a basis of homology cycles on g. for consistency,

the right hand side of eq. (3.4) has to be single-valued along the homology cycles. this

condition is satised if and only if the correlator gz(z; u, w) is a dierential of the third

kind normalized in such a way that all its periods are purely imaginary. let us denote this

normalized dierential with the symbol uw(z)dz. thus we require that:

gz(z; u, w)dz = uw(z)dz

(3.8)

the above equation determines gz(z; u, w)dz uniquely. comparing in fact eq. (3.6) with

the above equation and imposing the condition that uw(z)dz +pi bi (u, w)i(z)dz has

imaginary periods around all homology cycles, one obtains the following linear system of

2g equations in the 2g real unknowns re[bi(u, w)] and im[bi(u, w)]:

re"is

uw(z)dz +xi

bi(u, w)is

i(z)dz# = 0

s = 1, . . . , 2g

(3.9)

unfortunately, the construction of a basis of homology cycles on algebraic curves of the

kind discussed here is a complicated mathematical problem. as a consequence, the periods

i(z)dz cannot be evaluated in a closed form. an exception is pro-

hs

uw(z)dz and hs

vided by the zn symmetric curves, where these periods are expressed as denite integrals

having the branch points as extrema. in the present case, however, even the positions of

the branch points is unknown. the reason is that they are the roots of the polynomial

r(z) = 0, where r(z) is the resultant of the system (2.5) as discussed in the previous

section. clearly, those roots cannot be computed analytically apart from simple cases.

to avoid these diculties, we evaluate the coecients bi (u, w) using the riemanns

bilinear equations [13] :

0 =zg

uw  j =zg

d2zuw(z) i(z)

(3.10)

where the j (z)s denote the antiholomorphic dierentials on g. in appendix a we will
show that the above relation holds if and only if uw(z)dz is a normalized dierential of

the third kind with imaginary periods along the nontrivial homology cycles of g.

9

the integral in (3.10) is to be understood as a sum over all possible values of z and y for

which the relation f (z, y) = 0 is satised. supposing that the curve g is nondegenerate,

eq. (3.10) can be put in a form which is more convenient for explicit computations:

i =zcp1

d2z

n1

x=0

fz z(z, z; y()(z), y()(z))

(3.11)

a detailed proof of eq. (3.11) is provided in appendix b (see also [14]). once the polyno-

mial f (z, y) is given, it is possible to compute the integral (3.11) numerically. as a matter

of fact, to evaluate the integrand

iz z(z, z) =

n1

x=0

fz z(z, z; y()(z), y()(z))

(3.12)

appearing in (3.11) at any given point z  cp1, we just need to invert the equation
f (z, y) = 0. the latter is a polynomial equations of degree n from which one derives the n
roots y(0)(z), . . . , y(n1)(z). the values of y(0)(z), . . . , y(n1)(z) are obtained by complex

conjugation. the advantage of this strategy is that all branches of y(z) enter symmetrically

in the sum of eq. (3.12). thus it is not necessary to know how these branches are exchanged

at the branch points or any other information which requires the analytic continuation of

y(z).

using the identity (3.8), we substitute in eq. (3.10) the expression of gz(z; u, w)dz in

terms of the not normalized dierential uw(z)dz given by eq. (3.6). the solution of the

obtained in this way linear equations for coecients bi(u, w):

0 =zg

uw  j +xi

is in the matrix form given by

bi(u, w)zg

i(z)  j

bi(u, w) = xj "zg

in eq. (3.16) the range of the integers i, j, si and sj is given by eq. (2.22). moreover, we

notice that the integrals in eqs. (3.16) and (3.17) are convergent, since the integrands have

at most harmless poles of the rst order. these singularities occur only in the integrals

(3.17) at the points z = u, w and at innity. the singularity at innity is present only when

k = 0 and p > 1. clearly, the discussion following eq. (3.11) applies also to the particular

case of the integrals in (3.16) and (3.17), which can thus be computed numerically without

problems of analytical continuation.

eqs.

(3.15)-(3.17) provide an explicit representation of the correlator gz(z; u, w),

where neither the knowledge of a basis of homology cycles nor the analytic continuation

of multivalued functions are necessary. this is a great advantage, since the latter are

formidable problems in the case of general curves like those discussed in this paper. of

course, the integrals (3.16)-(3.17) are complicated and cannot be computed analytically,

but only numerically, exploiting for instance the recipe explained after eq. (3.11).

to conclude this section, we study the behavior of gz(z; u, w)dz for large values of u,

showing that there are no spurious divergences in this case. from eqs. (2.20) and (3.17)

one realizes that gz(z; u, w)dz depends on u through the function

when u becomes large, one can write:

f (u) =

k,0(u)
z  u

f (u) = f div(u) + f n(u)

where f div(u) diverges in u =  while f n(u) remains nite. it is easy to see that:

f div(u) =

using the above formula, we extract the diverging contributions gdiv

composite index:

hereafter, the dependence of i on k and i will be only understood for simplicity. after

of divergences when w approaches innity can be proved in the same way.

4. examples

a rst non-trivial example of curves which can be explicitly worked out is provided

by the algebraic curve:

y3 + 3py  2q = 0

(4.1)

q(z) is a polynomial of degree n0 = 6, while p(z) has degree n1  2n0
3 = 4. thus, exploiting
the formulas of section 2, one realizes that the curve (4.1) corresponds to the particular

case p = 2 and g = 4. for future convenience let us put:

solving equation (4.1) with respect to y one nds:

(z) = 3qq pq2 + p3

y = + + 2

 = 0, 1, 2

 = e

2i

3

12

(4.2)

(4.3)

the four holomorphic dierentials of the above curve are:

(0,s0)(z)dz =

zs0 dz

fy

(1,1)(z)dz =

ydz
fy

(4.4)

where s0 = 0, 1, 2 and fy = 3(y2 + p). the dierential of the third kind of eq. (2.17)
becomes in this particular case:

uw(z)dz =

y2(z) + y(z)y(u) + y2(u) + 3p(u)

fy(z, y(z))(z  u)

 (u  w)

(4.5)

at this point, we are ready to compute the matrix elements aij and i . they will be
expressed as integrals of single-valued forms on cp1. to simplify the notations, let us rst

dene the following functions:

f (z) =

2

y=0

fy(z, y()(z))

a(z, z) = 2

+(z)2

+(z) + 2

(z)2

(z) + p(z)p(z)

c(z, z) =(cid:2)+(cid:0)c2  ab(cid:1) + (cid:0)b2  ac(cid:1)(cid:3)
(b2  ac) + 2

e(z, z) = 3(cid:2)2+(a2  bc) + 2
+(cid:1) (a2  bc) +(cid:0)2

f (z, z) =

++  2p(cid:1) (b2  ac) +(cid:0)2

(4.14)

+(c2  ab)(cid:3)
  2p+(cid:1) (c2  ab)(cid:3) (4.15)

3(cid:2)(cid:0)2

the above functions are not meromorphic, since they depend both on z and z, but are

single-valued on cp1. to prove this fact, we notice that under the most general mon-
odromy transformation for going from one branch of the curve to another + behaves
as

+(z)  (z)

13

 = 0, 1, 2 mod 3

(4.16)

as can be easily seen from the explicit expression of + given by eq. (4.2). the above
equation xes also the monodromy properties of (z).
in fact, since +(z) and (z)
must satisfy the relation +(z)(z) = p(z), where p(z) is a singlevalued function of z,
it is clear from eq. (4.16) that (z) should transform as follows:

(z)  2(z)

(4.17)

moreover, taking the complex conjugate of both members of eqs. (4.16) and (4.17), one

nds:

+(z)  2(z)
(z)  (z)

(4.18)

(4.19)

it is now easy to check that the functions dened in eqs. (4.10)(4.15) are invariant under
the transformations (4.16)(4.19), so that they are single-valued on cp1. in terms of these

functions, the matrix elements aij and i appearing in the normalized dierential of the

third kind (3.15) read as follows:

d2z

a(0,s0)(0,s

0) =zcp1
a(1,0)(0,s0) =zcp1
a(0,s0)(1,0) =zcp1

substituting the matrix elements (4.20)(4.25) and the third kind dierential (4.5) in

eq. (3.15), we obtain the explicit expression of the correlator (3.3). as we see, all the

14

integrands appearing in the right hand sides of eqs. (4.20)(4.25) are one-valued on the

complex sphere as desired, since they depend on the one-valued functions (4.6)(4.15). in

this way the integrals in (4.20)(4.25) can be numerically evaluated without the problem

of performing the analytic continuation of y(z). also the problem of constructing a basis

of homology cycles has been avoided.

let us now briey discuss the simple case of the zn algebraic curves of the kind:

yn = p0(z)

(4.26)

where p0(z) is a polynomial of degree n0 = n, 2n, 3n, . . .. the genus of these curves is
provided by the general formula (2.23). for p > 1, i.e. n0 > n, the zero modes are:

j,sj (z)dz =

zsj yj(z)
yn1 dz

the matrix elements aij are given by:

a(i,si)(j,sj ) = 0

i 6= j

a(j,sj)(j,sj) = nzcp1

d2zzsj zsj|y y|1n+j

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

clearly, the integrand in the right hand side of the above equation is single-valued. in the

same way one can discuss the elements i (u). this is a straightforward exercise which

will not be performed here. instead, we compute on a zn symmetric curve the propagator

g(z; a) = h(z, z)(a, a)i

(4.30)

where a is one of the pn branch points of the curve (4.26). the starting point is the

weierstrass kernel at a branch point, which in the case of a zn symmetric curve takes a
particularly simple form (put y(a) = 0 in (2.16) ):

dz

we dene the following function on the complex sphere:

k1(z, a)dz =

n

g(z, w) =

1
2n

log(cid:18)|z  w|2
(1 + zz)(cid:19)

which has only logarithmic singularities for z  . g(z, w) satises the identity:

zzg(z, w) =

(4.31)

(4.33)

where (2)

z z (z  w) is dened by
zcp1

d2zf (z, z)(2)

z z (z  w) = f (w, w).

(4.34)

(1+z z)2 . let us now consider a two-form f (z, z) = fz z(z, z) dzz

(4.33) is the relation satised by a green function on the complex sphere with the metric
ds2 = dzdz

on g with su-
ciently smooth behavior. fz z is in general a multivalued function on cp1. exploiting eq.
(3.11), we have:

2i

zg

d2wfw w(w, w; y, y)(2)

z z (z w) 

d2wfw w(w, w; y()(w), y()(w))(2)

z z (z  w) =

x=0zcp1
x=0

f ()
z z (z, z).

(4.35)

on zn symmetric curves near branch points all the branches of y(z) coincide. for this
reason, if z  a eq. (4.35) becomes:

zg

d2wfw w(w, w; y, y)(2)

z z (a  w) = n fz z(z, z)| z=a

z=a

thus, the proper denition of a function on g at a branch point is 1

we try now an ansatz

g(z; a) = g(z, a)

d2w w wg(z, w)

(4.36)

(2)

(4.37)

for the propagator (4.30). in the obvious way g is treated in (4.37) as an object on g
the metric w w is given by eq. (2.25), while

a =zg

d2w w w

(4.38)

is the area of g. we notice that, by construction, the metric w w is zn symmetric, so
that all its branches coincide. as a consequence:

w w(w, w; y()(w)y()(w)) = w w(w, w)

(4.39)

where w w(w, w) is a tensor on cp1. thus, exploiting again eq. (3.11), we can put:

a = nzcp1

d2ww w(w, w)

16

(4.40)

applying now the laplacian on g to both members of eq. (4.37) and using eq. (4.33),

we nd that g(z, a) satises the following identity:

zzg(z, a) = (2)

z z (z  a) 

1
a

z z(z, z)

(4.41)

1

as explained above, the function on the algebraic curve near a branch point a is exactly
n (2)
z z (z  a). moreover, all the branches of the metric z z coincide with z z(z, z). thus
we conclude that eq. (4.37) is the desired propagator of the scalar elds when one of the

elds is located at a branch point.

5. conclusions

in this paper the correlator gz(z; u, w)dz dened in eq.

(3.3) has been computed

on the general algebraic curves (2.2). this green function plays a fundamental role in

the theory of massless scalar elds, since all other correlation functions can be written

in terms of its derivatives or integrals as shown by eqs. (3.4) and (3.5). the expression

of gz(z; u, w)dz given in eq. (3.15) depends explicitly on the constant parameters as,m

of the polynomial (2.2) as desired.

in fact, it contains the weierstrass kernel and the

holomorphic dierentials which have been derived in eqs. (2.16) and (2.21) respectively.
the calculation of the coecients aij and 
j (w), in principle more tricky, has been
reduced to the evaluation of the integrals (3.16) and (3.17) on the complex sphere. the

latter may very complicated, especially if the polynomial (2.2) has high degree n, but they

do not hide outstanding technical diculties and can be performed at least numerically (see

eq. (3.11) and the following discussion). actually, the integrands appearing in eqs. (3.16)

and (3.17) should also be single-valued, because they consists in the sum over all branches of

multivalued complex forms. this fact has been explicitly shown in the particular example

of an algebraic curve of genus four worked out in section 4. however, this example shows

also that the single-valuedness is realized in a very non-trivial way. let us notice that

the absence of technical problems in the computation of gz(z; u, w)dz was not granted a

priori. for instance, choosing the set of equations (3.9) in order to determine this green

function, we would have not been able to compute the necessary line integrals along the

homology cycles even numerically, since it is not known how to construct an homology

basis on general algebraic curves.

concluding, the formula (3.15), which gives the explicit form of the canonical third

kind dierential with purely imaginary periods, is new in the theory of algebraic curves and

17

has many potential applications beyond the theory of free scalar elds. let us remember

in fact that this canonical dierential is well known in the mathematical literature and has

already been widely used in physical applications of riemann surfaces. also the propagator

at the branch points of eq. (4.37) may have some interest in string theories. finally, we

have developed in this paper several techniques which might be useful for whoever is

wishing to work on general algebraic curves.

appendix a.

in this appendix we show that the condition (3.13) is valid if and only if uw(z)dz

is a dierential of the third kind normalized in such a way that all its periods around the

homology cycles are imaginary. in the proof, it will be convenient to use the representation
, where {ai, bi|i = 1, . . . , g}
is a canonical basis of homology cycles [12]. accordingly, the notation will be changed

of the riemann surface g as a polygon m =qg

j

i=1 ajbja1

j b1

with respect to the rest of the paper. let x, y be real coordinates on m and z = x + iy,
z = x  iy. the basis of canonical holomorphic dierentials on g will be denoted as
follows:

i = i(z)dz

i = 1, . . . , g

the i are normalized in such a way that:

j = ij

iai

j = tij

ibi

(a.1)

(a.2)

for i, j = 1, . . . , g. the tij = tji are elements of the period matrix t . this is a symmetric
g  g matrix with positive denite imaginary part. since m is simply connected, there
exist holomorphic functions fj(z) such that

dfj(z) = j(z)dz

(a.3)

in the above equation d denotes the external derivative operator such that d2 = 0. analo-
gously, one can dene the antiholomorphic dierentials j = j(z)dz and functions fj(z).

18

finally, third kind dierentials will be denoted with the symbol p q = p q(z)dz, with
p, q  m . we are now ready to prove the following

proposition: the conditions

zm

introducing the antiholomorphic
functions fj(z) and exploiting the stokes theorem after an integration by parts, we obtain:

(a.4) is true.

fjp q =

and remembering eq. (a.2), the rst term in the right side of eq. (a.6) becomes:

the second term gives instead:

(a.9)

zp q(z) = h(2)(z, p )  (2)(z, q)i

(a.10)

and dz  dz = 2idx  dy = 2id2x, where (2)(z, w) is the dirac  function on m dened
in such a way that

thus:

eqs. (a.13) and (a.14) provide a system of linear equations for the 2g unknown periods

kl are the elements

of its inverse. from eqs. (a.15) and (a.16) it is clear that the periods of p q are purely

imaginary as desired.

conversely, let us assume that (a.5) is true. evaluating as before rm p q  j we

obtain:

appendix b.

in this appendix we show that the surface integral over g of a tensor fz z(z, y) can

be rewritten in the form (3.11). the material presented here can be found in standard

textbooks [14] [39]. to keep the notations as simple as possible, we will omit to write

explicitly the dependence of fz z(z, y) on the conjugate variables z, y. we start from

i =zg

d2zfz z(z, y)

(b.1)

supposing that fz z(z, y) is such that the above integral is convergent. integrals of the kind
(b.1) are to be understood as a sum over all values of z  cp1 and y for which eq. (2.1)
is satised, i. e.:

i =z zcp1

f (z,y)=0

fz z(z, y)

since we assume that our curves are not degenerate, it is possible to write:

i =zcp1

d2zzcp1

d2ygfz z(z, y)(2)(f (z, y))

(b.2)

(b.3)

where g is the determinant of the metric in the y domain and the dirac function is

dened as follows:

d2ygf (y)(2)(y  y) = f (y)

zcp1

it is now convenient to choose a conformally at metric

gyy = gy y = 0

gy y = gyy

so that eq. (b.3) becomes:

i =zcp1

d2zzcp1

d2yfz z(z, y)(2)

y y (f (z, y))

(2)
y y (f (z, y)) =

1
4

yylog|f (z, y)|2

locally, we have that:

exploiting the relation

f (z, y) =

n1

(y  y()(z))

y=0

21

(b.4)

(b.5)

(b.6)

(b.7)

(b.8)

we see that the zeros of f (z, y) are concentrated at the branches of y(z), where f (z, y)

can be approximated as follows:

f (z, y)  fy(z, y()(z))(y  y()(z)) + . . .

(b.9)

as a consequence:

i =

n1

x=0zcp1

d2zzcp1

d2yfz z(z, y()(z))(2)

y y (cid:16)fy(z, y()(z))(y  y()(z))(cid:17)

(b.10)

performing now the change of variables

fy(z, y()(z))(y  y()(z)) = y

and integrating over y, we obtain the desired result:

i =zcp1

n1

x=0

fz z(z, y()(z))
