abstract

a matrix model for type 0 strings is proposed. it consists in making a non-supersymmetric

orbifold projection in the yang-mills theory and identifying the infrared congurations of

the system at innite coupling with strings. the correct partition function is calculated.
also, the usual spectrum of branes is found. both type a and b models are constructed.

the model in a torus contains all the degrees of freedom and interpolates between the
four string theories (iia, iib, 0a, 0b) and the m theory as dierent limits are taken.

1 introduction

matrix theory [7] has proven to be a useful tool to put together all the properties of
the dierent known corners of m theory. all the dualities arise very naturally and non-

perturbative objects can be handled in a way that is more dynamical. all objects with
dierent dimensionalities coexist in the same yang-mills action and therefore the brane
democracy has a clear meaning.

until recently, bosonic string theories were not part of the web of dualities that gath-
ered all others as realizations of the same m theory in dierent backgrounds. this theories

were developed in refs.[4] and others. in this work, i shall concentrate in type 0a and
type 0b bosonic string theories. the connection to the supersymmetric theories is got

with an orbifold compactication of iia [5] or m theory [1] that describes these models in
the appropriate limit of certain radius. there are also interpolating models constructed in

[2] that relate the bosonic and the supersymmetric strings in a continuous way. however,
there are still doubts on the validity of the interpolating model when the coupling is not
zero and the present knowledge of the branes of the theory is not complete yet. there

are, therefore, several reasons to try to make a matrix model of these strings and see how
much information can be obtained.

one of the problems that can be solved with this matrix model is the behaviour when
the coupling is not zero and, in particular, the way the tachyon acquires a mass and

ceases to yield the theory inconsistent. also, the duality relations are clearer because
they explicitly appear in the lagrangian. the introduction of d-brane backgrounds is

more problematic. they appear as objects of the theory but their interactions and, in
particular, the couplings to the closed string elds still require a better knowledge of open
type 0 strings.

2 description of the orbifold

the idea is to try to make an orbifold of the matrix model of m theory so that we

obtain a non-perturbative, matrix model of type 0 strings. as argued in [1] these strings
are compactications of m theory in an orbifolded circle. the rst step is, therefore, to

compactify the model in a circle through the construction of w. taylor [8] and arrive at
the hamiltonian

where everything is measured in units of l3
9 . the question is now how to make a
world-line orbifold of the yang-mills theory such that its eects are the same as the

pr1

target orbifold of ref.[1]. as an ansatz, we shall work with a similar one and test its
properties (spectrum, partition function, ...) to see if it, indeed, corresponds to a matrix
realization of type 0 strings. the ansatz is to project out all bosons with odd world-

line momentum. this way, world-line fermions eectively live in a circle of double size
that of the bosons. other way of looking at it is to consider that both live in the same

circle but with dierent boundary conditions: bosons are periodic while fermions can be
both periodic and anti-periodic. the conditions are similar to those one imposes around

the compact euclidean temporal direction when calculating at nite temperature. the
dierence is that fermions can also be periodic.

it is clear that these conditions break supersymmetry because they treat fermions and

bosons in a dierent manner. one important consequence is that the zero modes of the
oscillators do not cancel. moreover, because of the fact that there are twice as many

fermionic as bosonic modes, the vacuum has an innite negative energy signalling the
existence of a tachyon in the target theory.

in order to properly identify the string states, it is necessary to use other parameters

the perturbative string limit is the strong coupling limit of the yang-mills theory. to

analyse the spectrum we have to go to the infrared limit. there, the scalars take vacuum
expectation values and break the gauge symmetry to its cartan sub-algebra (u(1)n ).
this gives masses to all the elds so that in the extreme infrared, everything can be
considered decoupled but the photons and the scalars that correspond to the commuting

part of the matrices. this part will give us the free strings. there are eight scalars related
by the so(8) r-symmetry, one gauge eld and their fermionic partners.

the spectrum of these elds can be obtained expanding them in a fourier series. the

hamiltonian is then a sum of fermionic and bosonic oscillators like

4
r+

h = xn

2

n + xnn2xn + fermions

(4)

it is not immediate to see the dierent sectors (ns-ns, r-r,...) this way because the
action we are dealing with is the equivalent of the green-schwarz action, not the neveu-

2

schwarz-ramond version. in the latter formalism, one can classify the elds according to
the boundary conditions of the fermionic operator that is used to create them from the

vacuum. with the g-s action, one just generates the whole spectrum acting with the
supercharges over the vacuum state. this is impossible in this case because we do not
have any. what we shall do is to compute the whole spectrum and see how it is organised

in terms of the characters of the spin group.

3 the partition function.

the best way of obtaining the spectrum is to calculate the internal partition function of
the theory. usual light-cone type 0 string theory is supposed to emerge in the large-n

limit of the gauge theory. in the limit of innite coupling, the hamiltonian is truncated
to the free part. besides, we can identify

n
r+

= p+

(5)

apart from the n diagonal elds of each class, there can also exist excitations with twisted

boundary conditions like these

x(2) = u x(0)u

(6)

where u is an element of the z n group of permutations. this group is the centre of the
u(n) gauge group and it is not broken even when the scalars take vacuum expectation

values. for each element of the group there is a partition of the whole matrix in twisted
states that represent single string states whose light-cone momentum is p+ = ni/r+. the
presence of states with several strings is a consequence of the fact that matrix models

automatically include the second quantisation of the objects they describe. the partition
function of the usual (non-matrix) strings calculated computing the path integral of the

world-sheet elds is, in fact, a single string partition function. as we now want to compare
the matrix results with the usual ones, we have to restrict the computation to single

string states. with that, the nal action is the green-schwarz light-cone action modied
so that the fermionic elds can also be anti-periodic when going around the world-sheet

coordinate.

we are now ready to nd out the contribution of each eld. it is easier if we imagine
that all elds live in the bosonic circle (radius r9) and let bosons be periodic and fermions
both periodic and anti-periodic. the partition function can be seen as a trace over states
that can be performed calculating the propagator of the elds with periodic (or anti-

periodic) boundary conditions. the part of each boson is

(7)

this is obtained with the usual techniques of determinant regularization and schwinger
it is quite standard, so i shall not explain every step. the

integral representations.

fermions can be organised in spin structures according to the boundary conditions one
chooses in both directions. one has to calculate the determinant of the dirac operator
on the torus (of complex parameter  ) with eigenvalues (n + m) with n an m integers if

the elds are periodic and integers plus one half if they are anti periodic. after a proper
regularization the results are

(8)

for the right moving part of each eld. the rst condition refers to the  direction. after
multiplying the bosonic and the fermionic left and right-moving parts and summing over

all the possible spin structures, the result is

z =

(9)

this is exactly the partition function of type 0 string theories. in our case the chirality
of fermions is that of an a theory so this should be a description of type 0a string theory.

with this function we can analyse the sectors of the spectrum reordering the jacobi
functions. one can put it this way

(11)

where the  functions are the characters of the dierent representations of the target

lorentz group. notice that all of them are bosonic. the characters tell us the rotational

4

properties of each eld. the v v sector is the gravitational one, it corresponds to the ns-
ns sector of the supersymmetric theories and contains, among other elds, the graviton.
the ii sector contains the tachyon and the two others are the two r-r sectors. we can
now nd more explicitly the mass spectrum and the degeneracies expanding the partition
function in a series of exponentials of 2, once the integral over 1 is done. the rst orders
are

z =  4

2 (cid:16)q2 + 192 + 1296q2 + o(q4)(cid:17)

(12)

where q = e22. the rst addend is divergent in the infrared (when 2 is large) and is
the contribution of the tachyon. the second addend corresponds to the massless elds (64
degrees of freedom come from each r-r sector and 64 more from the gravitational one).

the partition function is a modular form, invariant, in particular under the inversion of
2. this means that its ultraviolet behaviour is exactly the same as the infrared one.
the infrared divergence of the tachyon is the same as the ultraviolet hagedorn growth of

the degeneracies. if the latter requires a small temperature to be regularized, the former
would require a high one, so that nally, the theory is not sensible at any temperature;

at least with g = 0.

4 the long-range potential

one of the eects of the appearance of a tachyon is that it is impossible to calculate

a potential because the interchange of tachyons is extremely divergent in the infrared.
let us see that this is indeed our case. at one loop, it is not dicult to obtain the

vacuum energy of the free elds in the compactied theory. the easiest way is to use
the background gauge and count the number of fermionic and bosonic elds at each mass

level. in the schwinger representation the result is

v

4s r+

v (r) =

sinh sv 
h16es(2n)2gsr+ cosh sv  es(n)2gsr+ (4 cosh 2sv  12)i

gs xn z dss1/2esr2r+/gs

1

when the coupling is small, one has to make a poisson resummation and get

v
4

v (r) =

r+gs xn z dss1esr2r+/gs

sinh sv 
h8esn2/(4gsr+) cosh sv  esn2/gsr+) (4 cosh 2sv  12)i

1

which in the infrared behaves as

s2 esr2r+/gs

(13)

(14)

(15)

this is divergent and denotes the existence of the tachyon in the spectrum. it is possible
for us to do perturbative computations in spite of dealing with a strongly-coupled theory

because, in fact, we have deduced the form of the eective theory at low energies and it
has turned out to be free. it is this free theory the one we have calculated the vacuum
energy for and not the whole one. an analogous computation to this one was done in

ref.[6]. there, the potential between two d3-branes was calculated. it was also divergent
in a similar way and was given the same interpretation as a tachyonic eect. in order to

give a sensible result, the authors of that reference introduced an infrared (in the image
of the closed strings) cut-o and regularized the potential.

5 0b strings and the dualities.

we shall now be interested in describing models for 0b strings and how they can in-
terpolate between them and the supersymmetric theories. for that, it is necessary to

compactify the theory further in a second circle (third, taking into account also the light-
like one) of radius r8. after using again the yang-mills duality described in [8] we have
a theory in 2 + 1 dimensions. around the second circle the elds have the usual periodic
boundary conditions. this model interpolates between all ve theories (iia, iib, 0a, 0b

and m). if one chooses both radii to be small, the resulting infrared limit describes a type
b theory. which one depends on the particular choice of the string coupling constant

or

s =

s =

(16)

(17)

in this latter case it is the coupling constant of type iib theory compactied in the orb-

ifolded circle. when we take that circle to innity, it will coincide with the supersymmetric
case. the hamiltonian is

(18)

with the constraint that bosons are periodic around both directions but fermions are
periodic around 8 and can be periodic or anti-periodic around 9. this dierence between
the two directions spoils the sl(2, z) symmetry of iib strings. the self-duality is reduced
to an s-duality between two dierent theories.

which is strongly coupled in the yang-mills. the extreme infrared limit is again described

as in the previous case, the limit where the strings give a good description is g0b

by the commuting elds and the structure of twisted states is also the same as that in
the iia (or 0a) theories (see [11, 10] where this aspect, and others, are studied for type

iia and iib matrix string theories).

we can now analyse the spectrum. that of the scalars is

with both n and m integers. we can see the iib-like structure of (p, q)-strings. in fact
there is no dierence in the bosonic sector. the gauge eld has the same spectrum as
the scalars, but one has to consider also the purely topological sectors. there are three
dierent elements of f . the two electric components have congurations like

to the spectrum. one has to impose the condition of transversality of the electric eld

and the momentum

which means that

~p ~e = 0

a(k, l) = b(n, m),

(23)

(24)

where all numbers are integer. as a result, b is the winding number, a is the excitation
number and the true tension is a1(n, m) = b1(k, l) = (p, q). a similar quantisation

7

condition holds for the magnetic eld. in this case the easiest way to obtain the energies
is to follow [13] and to quantise the momentum of the string along the eighth direction.

adding up every term, we have obtained

(26)

this is exactly the bosonic spectrum of type b theories compactied in a circle. the

fermions make the dierence because their p tensions can also be half integers. this
is what breaks the sl(2, z) symmetry of type iib, but not completely because there are
still bound states of 0b an iib strings. when one takes the coupling to be very small, one
has to keep only the ( 1
2, 0)-strings. the spectrum of the (p, q)-strings depends on whether
p is integer or not. if it is, fermions are periodic around the world-sheet and the spectrum

is that of the iib strings while if p is half an odd number, the multiplets are those of type
0b strings.

this also shows that, as proposed in [1], the tachyon acquires a mass when the coupling
is not small. the reason is that when g0b
is large, one should make a ip (an s-duality)
and consider r8 to be the quantum circle. the hamiltonian is the same again but the
fermions are periodic in the world-sheet, and therefore generate the iib supersymmetric
spectrum. the rst level is the massless one so we conclude that, at least at large coupling,

s

the theory is sensible and does not contain tachyons. the swap of the role of the two
circles depends on their sizes and determines the phase structure of m theory in this

compactication (see g.1).

when one takes the coupling constant to zero and keeps only the ( 1

2, 0)-strings, one
can calculate their partition function. as in the supersymmetric case [11], it is necessary
to integrate over the dual of the photon eld after adding a topological contribution

f8

(27)

with this new scalar , the so(8) symmetry is restored. also, the fermions change their
chirality as is usual in a t-duality, which is, ultimately, what we are doing. with this, it
is immediate to see that the partition function of these strings is exactly the same as that

of the 0a computed above. the only dierence is the chirality of fermions. as a result,
this model reproduces type 0b string theory.

the type iib limit is the opposite (giib

s = r8/r9  0). the type iia string can be
achieved sending now r8 to innity. with a dimensional reduction of the 8 direction,
the hamiltonian simply reduces to that of ref. [9]. fig.1 sketches all the dualities on this

torus.

6 non-perturbative states

in usual supersymmetric matrix string theories one can study non-perturbative objects
nding out the uxes of elds that contribute to the central charges of the supersymmetry
algebra. in this case we do not have that guide. however, similar uxes of elds can be

seen to act as dirichlet objects and therefore they are unstable non-perturbative eects
with renormalised masses and charges. in fact, in the derivation of their existence and

their behaviour as walls where the open strings can end [13, 12, 9] only the bosonic sector
is needed, so one can extrapolate known results to this case.

we have already seen one of the non-perturbative objects, the d-string. among others,
the usual iib massless spectrum has appeared. from the point of view of the 0b corner
(gs = r9/r8), they have acquired a large mass due to the fact that they are strongly
coupled, but still keep their form as a supersymmetric multiplet, including the fermions.
another interesting case is that of d0-branes in 0a theory. the ux related to them,

as well as to their bound states is

where e9 is the electric eld and n is the charge of the bound state. as argued in [12], the
presence of a constant electric eld forbids the other elds from carrying momentum so

(28)

1

2 i de9 = n

9

that there cannot be any excited oscillators in the yang-mills and the object with that ux
has to be point-like. what makes it act as a dirichlet point is precisely that fact: when

a twisted state is formed between a perturbative string and a d0-brane (that is, between
two matrices with and without constant background electric elds), there cannot be a
ux of momentum (oscillator number) across the part of the world-sheet with constant

electric eld (d-particle) so that it acts as a wall against which the momentum of the
string rebounds; that is why it provides it with dirichlet boundary conditions.

membranes in 0a an d3-branes in 0b theories are related to non-commutative con-

gurations of elds like

 =

i

4 z d8tr < hx 7, x 6i >= t2a.

(29)

in the 0b case one also has to integrate over the 9 direction, which is the third world-
volume dimension of the d3-brane. the other branes are related to other uxes exactly
like in ref.[13, 9].

7 interactions

as in ref.[9, 10], interactions appear when the condition of innite coupling in the yang-
mills theory is relaxed a bit. with that assumption there are special points in the moduli

space where part of the broken gauge symmetry is restored. this happens whenever
at least two eigenvalues of the matrices coincide for one value of 9. the symmetry is
enhanced to su(2) and asymptotically the eect is the interchange of the eigenvalues,
that is, the action of an element of the unbroken centre of the group, zn . this means
that also in this case the interactions are local in the world-sheet and appear in the target
space as splitting and joining processes. in the absence of any supersymmetry it is hard
to nd the operators in the cft that act as vertices. that would involve dealing with

a non-perturbative expansion of a yang-mills theory without any supersymmetry. also,
some relation should be found between the running of the coupling constant in the yang-

mills and the string theory. the only thing we can say, for the moment, is that, in the
infrared, they can be given a geometrical interpretation as string interactions.

8 conclusions

the model presented here is a simple orbifold construction of the matrix model of strings

that describes closed type 0 strings as infrared xed points of one and two dimen-
sional yang-mills theories. the world-sheet action is not supersymmetric but it contains

10

fermions that, together with bosons generate the correct spectrum. the partition function
is modular invariant.

the eect of the tachyon is to provoke an infrared divergence both in the partition

function and in the long-range supergravity potential.

the two-dimensional yang-mills theory describes the iib/0b dual system with (p, q)

bound states that can be purely bosonic or ll up a supersymmetric multiplet. in par-
ticular iib or 0b strings appear as non-perturbative excitations of the dual theory. as

a conclusion, the 0b theory, although completely bosonic perturbatively, does contain
fermions when the coupling is not zero. also, this model contains, through dimensional

reductions, the two other corners of the duality, the type a theories.

other branes can also be described as uxes. without supersymmetry, these objects
are not protected against decay or renormalization of their masses and charges, neverthe-

less they are true excitations of the model. a more profound study would need a better
knowledge of open type 0 strings.
