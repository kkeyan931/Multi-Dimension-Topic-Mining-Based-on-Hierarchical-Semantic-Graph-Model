abstract

we consider the eective action for massive two-dimensional qed in at eu-

clidean space-time in the background of a general square-integrable magnetic

eld with nite range. it is shown that its small mass limit is controlled by

the chiral anomaly. new results for the low-energy scattering of electrons in

2+1 dimensions in static, inhomogenous magnetic elds are also presented.

i. introduction

fermionic determinants lie at the heart of gauge eld theories with fermions. they are

obtained by integrating over the fermionic degrees of freedom in the presence of a background

potential a, producing the one-loop eective action se =  ln det, where the fermionic
determinant, det, is formally the ratio det(6 p 6a + m)/det(6 p + m) of determinants of dirac
operators. the coupling constant e has been absorbed into a. this action is exact and

appears in the calculation of every physical process. therefore, any truly nonperturbative

calculation must deal with se in its full generality. the main problem with calculating se

is that it must be known for generic potentials, typically tempered distributions, if it is to

be part of an eective measure for a. a summary of what is known about se in quantum

electrodynamics in 1+1, 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions for general elds is given in sec.i of ref.1.

recall that se in qed only depends on the eld strength tensor f . it is seen that there

are upper and lower bounds on se, with some bounds holding only for restricted elds, such

as unidirectional ones. after fty years or so there are still no equalities in qed for general

elds, except for massless qed in 1+1 dimensions - the schwinger model [2].

in this paper an equality is obtained for the chiral limit of se in two-dimensional, wick-

rotated euclidean qed for a general eld, hereafter referred to as a static magnetic eld

b(r). of course b is not completely unrestricted. we described elsewhere [1,3] precisely, how

rough potentials and elds are to be smoothed as part of the regularization process required

to make the functional integration over a well-dened. it is sucient to assume in this

paper that a is dierentiable and that b is square integrable with nite range r. then b

is guaranteed to have nite ux, , since ||b||  ||/ r, where ||b||2 = r d2rb(r)2 and

2

 = r d2rb(r). the author knows of no denition of a determinant that can handle innite

ux elds; there is simply too much degeneracy [4], resulting in volume-like divergences

(which are ignored) as in the constant eld case. furthermore, nite ux and range are

consistent with the need to introduce a volume cuto to dene qed2 before taking the

thermodynamic limit.

with the foregoing restrctions on b our result is

m2 

m2 ln det = ||

4

lim
m20

,

(1.1)

where m is the fermion mass. together with the exact scaling relation

ln det(2b(r), m2) = ln det(b(r), m2/2) ,

(1.2)

(1.1) implies the strong eld limit

ln det(2b(r), m2)

1 ||

2

ln  + r() ,

(1.3)

where

lim(r()/ ln ) = 0 . note that the chiral limit in (1.1) implies that qed2s fermionic



determinant behaves like (||/4) ln m2 as m  0, which does not coincide with that of the
schwinger model.

for nonwinding background elds with  = 0 one can prove continuity at m = 0. as

a result, massive qed2s fermionic determinant does coincide with that of the schwinger

model at m = 0:

ln det =

lim
m0

1

42 z d2rd2rb(r)b(r) ln|r  r| .

(1.4)

this follows from results of seiler [5] and simon [6] as will be shown in a future paper.

3

it is reasonable to ask what is the relevance of qed2s fermionic determinant, and its mass

dependence in particular, to physics? the answer is that the integral of this determinant over

the fermion mass fully determines qed4s fermionic determinant for the same magnetic eld

b(r) [7]. this determinant is still unknown except for a constant eld [8,9] and a sech2(x/r)

varying unidirectional eld [10].

from the input parameters to the qed2 determinant one can form the dimensionless

ratios e||b||/mc2 and h/mcr, where e has been temporarily restored. this paper deals with
the nonperturbative, small mass region e||b||/mc2, h/mcr  1. the large mass region can
be dealt with by a derivative expansion of ln det [11]. what remains in order to estimate

qed4s fermionic determinant for general unidirectional elds are optimal upper and lower

bounds on qed2s determinant for intermediate values of the mass.

the derivation of (1.1) is really just a problem in quantum mechanics dealing with a

particle conned to a planar surface with an inhomogenous magnetic eld normal to it. the

proportionality of the limit in (1.1) to the two-dimensional chiral anomaly, /2, as well

as its sign and its connection with paramagnetism, are discussed in ref.12. equation (1.1)

was established in ref.12 in nite volume for a unidirectional eld b(r)  0. there is a
missing volume factor in equation (2.7) that was corrected in ref.13. these restrictions are

dropped in this paper.

finally, the chiral limit of qed2s continuum fermionic determinant should provide a

nontrivial test of algorithms for the determinant on large lattices. the reason is that chiral

limits and topological invariants - the chiral anomaly in this instance - are notoriously

dicult to calculate on a lattice [14]. many of the results here on low-energy scattering

in static, inhomogenous magnetic elds are new and are relevant to the physical case of

4

electrons in such elds in 2+1 dimensions.

in sec.ii we discuss how we will demonstrate (1.1). section iii develops the essentials

of low-energy scattering in inhomogenous magnetic elds that will be required. in sec.iv

the crucial argument that central symmetry is sucient to establish (1.1) is given. finally,

sec.v gives the ne points of the limit (1.1).

ii. preliminaries

we adopt schwingers proper time denition [9] of the fermionic determinant for eu-

clidean qed2:

ln det =

then

1

2 z 

0

dt
t

tr (ep 2t  exp{[(p  a)2  3b]t})etm2

.


m2 ln det =

1
2

tr [(d2  3b + m2)1  (p 2 + m2)1] ,

where d2 = (p  a)2 and 3 is the pauli matrix. now introduce the sum rule [15]

tr [(d2  b + m2)1  (d2 + b + m2)1] =


2m2 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

where the trace is over space indices only, and assume without loss of generality that  > 0.

then (2.2) and (2.3) give

m2 

m2 ln det =


4

+ m2tr [(d2 + b + m2)1  (p 2 + m2)1] .

(2.4)

the continuum part of the spectrum of the negative chirality operator d2 + b stretches

down to zero in the case of open spaces. because  > 0 the square-integrable zero modes

are conned to the spectrum of d2  b [16]. although b has no denite sign, its ux does,

5

and , chirality and the number of square-integrable zero modes of the supersymmetric pair

of operators d2  b are correlated by the aharonov -casher theorem. at this stage the
minor modications one has to make to deal with the case when  < 0 are already clear.

it might seem that (2.4) makes (1.1) self-evident. but if (2.3) is multiplied by m2 and the

limit m2 = 0 taken, then the fractional part of the chiral anomaly is given by a dierence of

zero-energy phase shifts of opposite chirality [17], demonstrating that the trace dierence in

(2.3) develops a 1/m2- type singularity at the bottom of the continuum. how, then, does

one know a priori that such a singularity is absent from the trace in (2.4)?

our denition of the determinant in (2.1) leads us to dene the trace in (2.4) by a dierence

of diagonal heat kernels,

tr [(d2 + b + m2)1  (p 2 + m2)1] = z 

0

dtetm2 z d2r < r | e(d2+b)t  ep 2t | r > .

(2.5)

denote the scattering states of d2 + b corresponding to outgoing radial waves by

(+)(k, r) =< r | k, in > whose eigenvalues are e = k2. these satisfy the normalization
condition

z d2r (+) (k, r) (+)(k, r) = (k  k) .

(2.6)

assume that b(r) is noncentral. let  denote the direction of the incident beam with

momentum k relative to an axis xed in the scattering center. the asymptotic behavior of

(+)(k, r) for kr  1 is

(+)(k, r) =

1
2

eikr cos() +

f (, )
2r

eikr + r ,

(2.7)

where f is the scattering amplitude and r is the remainder in the large-r expansion of (+).

equation (2.7) is obtained from the lippmann-schwinger equation

6

(+)(k, r) =

(k|r  r|)v (r)(+)(k, r) ,

where h (+)

0

is a hankel function of the rst kind and

v = p  a  a  p + a2 + b .

as we will show later, we can choose a gauge such that

a =


2r

 ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

for r suciently large, where  is a unit vector orthogonal to r. therefore, we are dealing

with a long range (1/r2) potential v , and this is what makes the proof of (1.1) nonroutine.

the completeness of the in states for d2 + b and (2.5) give

d(|(+)(k, r)|2  |0(k, r)|2) ,

(2.11)

where 0(k, r) = eikr/2. we are interested in the small m2, high t limit of (2.11) which

is determined by the low energy end of the spectrum of d2 + b. therefore we cut o the

energy integral in (2.11) at m with mr  1 and consider, for m2  0,

tr [(d2 + b + m2)1  (p 2 + m2)1]
= z 
dk kek2tz 2

dtetm2 z d2r z m

d(|(+)(k, r)|2  |0(k, r)|2) + r(m2) .

(2.12)

the remainder, r, can be put in the form

z

et(m2+m 2)z d2rz 

0

dppep2tz 2

0

d(|(+)(qp2 + m 2, r, )|2  |0(qp2 + m 2, r, )|2) ,

which makes the energy gap between 0 and m evident so that

lim m2r(m2) = 0 . thus,
m2

0

(2.4) shows that (1.1) will be established if the integral in (2.12) multiplied by m2 vanishes

in the limit m2 = 0.

7

we will calculate in the lorentz gauge a = 0 which, in two dimensions, allows us to

set a =  with

b(r, ) = 2(r, ) ,

(2.13)

and  =  with 12 = 1. assuming that b has range r we can calculate  in a
disk d of radius a  r with (a, ) = 0. a unique solution of poissons equation with
dirichlet boundary conditions requires that we also specify  as r  , which we will do by
requiring that  approach the potential of a ux line through the origin. the construction

of the dirichlet greens function for this problem is standard, with the result

(r, ) = 

1

ln(r/a) , r > a .

d2rb(r, ) ln  r2 + r2  2rr cos(  )

a2  2rr cos(  )! , r < a

a2 + r2r2

(2.14)

this potential results in a discontinuity in /r at r = a that is of order ||b||r2/a2 and
which vanishes in the limit of radial symmetry. this introduces a zero-ux, zero-range

magnetic eld on a ring at r = a that does not aect the low energy phase shifts. what is

gained by this is radial symmetry for r > a.

from (2.12) it is evident that we will need the outgoing wave solution of

[(p  a)2 + b](+) = k2(+) ,

(2.15)

for k  0. this can be solved explicitly in the exterior region r > a with overall normal-
ization xed by (2.7). we can approximate the interior solution by the exact zero-energy

solution of (2.15) because k2 is a regular perturbation of d2 + b for r < a. then an interior

solution of (2.15) can be expanded as a power series in k2. following this the interior and

exterior solutions are matched at r = a [17].

8

iii. low energy scattering states

since the case of noncentral potentials may be unfamiliar we will parallel our discussion

with the special case of radial symmetry in the interest of clarity.

a. central eld: r > a

expand (+)(k, r) in partial waves,

(+)(k, r) =

1
2 



xl=

l(k, r)eil() .

equations (3.1) and (2.6) give the normalization condition

z 

0

drr l (k, r) l(k, r) = (e  e) .

(3.1)

(3.2)

substitution of (3.1) and (2.10) in (2.15) results in bessels equation for l, with l shifted

to l  /2 for r > a. in order to include the case when /2 is an integer we choose as
linearly independent solutions the hankel functions h ()
(kr) whose asymptotic behavior

|l/2|

for r   is

h ()



(kr)  s 2

kr

ei(kr/2/4) .

setting w = |l  /2| we construct l as the following linear combination
w (kr)(cid:17) ,

w (kr) + ei(w|l|) e2il(k) h (+)

(cid:16)h ()

l(k, r) =

eiw/2 ei|l|

22

(3.3)

(3.4)

where sl = e2il is the s-matrix for the partial phase shift l. recalling that in two dimensions

eikr = eikr cos() =



xl=

il jl(kr) eil() ,

(3.5)

and noting (3.3) we see that the normalization factors in (3.4) ensure that (3.1) assumes the

asymptotic form (2.7) as r  .

9

b. general eld: r > a

although radial symmetry is present for r > a, the absence of rotational symmetry for

r < a can cause the incident particle to scatter into a nal state that is a superposition of

angular momentum states. thus the s-matrix is no longer diagonal in l : sl  sl,l, where
l is the initial-state angular momentum. then (3.1) generalizes to

(+)(k, r) =

1

2  xl,l

l,l(k, r) eil eil ,

which, together with (2.6), results in the normalization condition

xl z 

0

drr l,l(k, r) l,l(k, r) = l,l (e  e) .

equation (3.4) now generalizes to

l,l(k, r) = ei(wl+wl)/4 ei(|l|+|l|)/2

(3.6)

(3.7)

wl

(kr)(cid:17) ,

(3.8)

where wl = |l  /2|, etc.. unless  needs to be displayed, as in (3.6), we suppress it in
what follows. again, the normalization factors in (3.8) are chosen so that (3.6) assumes the

asymptotic form (2.7). the scattering amplitude is given by

f (k, k) =

1

2k xl,l

(sl,l  l,l) eil eil ei(wlwl1)/4 .

(3.9)

c. general eld: r < a

we seek zero-energy solutions of (2.15) in the region r < a that are suciently regular

to maintain the hermiticity of d2 + b. this operator factorizes to ll so that (2.15) at

k2 = 0 reduces to

10

ll = 0 ,

where

l = ei   1

one set of solutions is given by

whose solution by inspection is

l = 0 ,

 = e(r,) g(rei) ,

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

where g is analytic in rei in and on the disk d. solutions of the form (3.13) do not give

all of the regular solutions of (3.10). this is evident in the limit of radial symmetry, for then

 is a superposition of only negative or zero angular momentum states.

there are irregular solutions of (3.12) and hence (3.10) of the form

 = e(r,) h(r1ei) ,

(3.14)

where h may be expanded in a power series away from the origin. these solutions can be

used to nd additional regular solutions of (3.10) that reduce to superpositions of positive

angular momenta in the radial symmetry limit. thus, we look for regular solutions about

the origin of the form

then (3.10) gives

 = e h(r1ei) f (r, ) .

l"e ei h(r1ei)   f

(3.15)

(3.16)

again by inspection the solution of (3.16) is

e ei h   f

r

f

 ! = e b(rei) ,

(3.17)

where b is analytic in rei in and on d. actually, h is now an unnecessary complication.

letting f = f (r, )/h, we get

and hence (3.15) becomes

f
r 

i
r

f


= ei e2 b(rei) ,

 = e f .

(3.18)

(3.19)

equation (3.18) indicates that f is undetermined up to a function of the form p(rei). but

this is the same as g in (3.13), and so we set p = 0. also, the value of  at the origin can

be xed by g. so for deniteness we require f (0) = 0. noting that

2 = ei   

r 

i
r

the solution of (3.18) is, for r  d,

(3.21)

where c is a constant xed by f (0) = 0. since

f takes the nal form

! ln (|r  r|/r) .

combining (3.13), (3.19) and (3.23), the general solution of (3.10) is

12

(3.22)

(3.23)

(r, ) = e(r,) (g(rei) + f (r, )) .

(3.24)

the functions b, f and g will be determined below when we join the region r < a with

r > a. they then acquire energy-dependent normalization factors that depend on scattering

data, including the initial-state angular momentum l. thus  in (3.24) has an implicit

dependence on .

as discussed at the end of sec. ii, k2 is a regular perturbation of d2 + b in (2.15) in the

region r < a. hence the radial wave functions l,l(k, r) in (3.6) may be expanded in k2 for

r < a. inserting the implicit -dependence of (r, ) in (3.24) we expand it in partial waves

(r, , ) = xl,l

l,l(r) eil eil .

l,l(k, r)/2 = l,l(r) (cid:16)1 + k2l,l(r) + o(k4)(cid:17)

(3.25)

(3.26)

we set

and thus

(+)(k, r) = (r, , ) +

k2

(2)2 z 2

d z 2

0

d (r,   ,   ) (r, , ) + o(k4) ,

(3.27)

where  can be expanded as in (3.25). we will abbreviate (3.27) as

(+)(k, r) = (r, ) + k2   + o(k4) ,

(3.28)

where the star denotes convolution. an equation for  can be obtained by substituting

(3.28) in (2.15) and retaining terms of order k2. as we will see,  is not required in the

general eld case.

13

to x b and f dene the operator

,

and let it act on (+) in (3.28), using (3.24):

l (+) =  l  + e l f + k2l    + o(k4l) .

equation (2.14) with r = a gives

 (a, ) = 0 , (r(r, ))a = /2a + o(||b||r2/a2) .

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

from now on the arbitrarily small correction to the radial derivative of  at r = a will be

implicit in what follows. thus (3.31) and (3.18) applied to (3.30) at r = a give

l (+)(k, a, ) =  (a, )/2a + ei b(aei) + k2l    + o(k4l) .

(3.32)

denote the wave functions on either side of a by (+)

< and (+)

> . continuity of (+) and

l (+) at r = a and repeated use of (3.28) allow (3.32) to be put in the form

ei b(aei) = (l  /2a) (+)

>  k2 (+)

>  /2a + k2l (+)

>   + o(k4l(+)
> ) .

since b(rei) is analytic in and on d we can make the expansion

b(rei) =



xl=0



xl=

bl,l rl eil eil ,

(3.33)

(3.34)

where we have anticipated the -dependence of b. from (3.6), (3.33) and (3.34) we get

2bl1,l al1 =   d

dr

+ (l  /2)/r! >

l,l(k, r) (1 + k2l,l(r) + o(k4)) ,

(3.35)

with r = a after dierentiating. referring to (3.8) it is evident from (3.35) that the expansion

coecients bl,l and hence b and f in (3.23) will be determined to leading order in k2 once

sl,l is known.

14

there now remains the function g in (3.24). equations (3.24) and (3.28) together with

continuity of (+) at r = a give

(+)

> (k, a, ) = g(aei) + f (a, ) + k2  (a, ) + o(k4) .

(3.36)

letting

f (r, ) = xl,l

fl,l(r) eil eil ,

and recalling that g is analytic in and on d so that





g(rei) =

xl=
we obtain from (3.6), (3.36)-(3.38), for l  0,
l,l(k, a)/2 = gl,l al + fl,l(a) + k2>

xl=0

gl,l rl eil eil ,

l,l(k, a) l,l(a)/2 + o(k4>

(3.37)

(3.38)

(3.39)

this simplies on making the expansion

ln(r2 + r2  2rr cos(  )) = ln r2

(3.41)

thus g is determined to leading order in k2 by (3.38)-(3.39) once sl,l is known. we have

now fully determined the low energy limit of (+)(k, r) for general magnetic elds in terms

of the s-matrix.

d. central field: r < a

now everything is diagonal, and we may set a = r. refer back to (3.4) and dene the

energy-dependent part, l, of the phase shifts by

15

l(k2) = (|l|  |l  /2|)/2 + l(k2) + m ,

(3.42)

where m = 0,1, ... then (3.4) reduces to, for r > a,

l(k, r) = 21/2 (1)m i|l| eil (jw (kr) cos l  yw (kr) sin l) ,

(3.43)

where yw is the bessel function of the second kind. then at r = a with ka  1 and w 6= 0,

l (k, a) = 21/2 (1)m i|l| eil [(ka/2)w /(w + 1) + l (w ) (ka/2)w /]
>

(1 + o(k2, 2

l )) ,

(rr >

l )a = 21/2 w (1)m i|l| eil [(ka/2)w /(w + 1)  l (w ) (ka/2)w /]

(1 + o(k2, 2

l )) .

(3.44)

(3.45)

it will be shown in sec. iv that l = o(ka)2w at least. in (3.44) and (3.45) the remainder

term o(k2, 2

l ) should be replaced with o((ka)2 ln ka) when w = 1.

we can now calculate bl1 in (3.35). for l > /2, (3.35), (3.44) and (3.45) give

bl1 al = 1 (l  /2) (1)m il eil (ka/2)w /(w + 1) (1 + o(k2, 2

l )) ,

(3.46)

and for 1  l < /2,

bl1 al = 2 (l  /2) (1)m il eil l (w )(ka/2)w (1 + o(k2, 2

l )) .

(3.47)

for the case w = 0,

for gl, (3.39) gives

bl1 al = 2 (1)m il eil l (1 + o(2

l )) .

gl =

l(k, a)
2al

(1  k2l(a) + o(k4)) ,

16

(3.48)

(3.49)

since (3.41) gives f0,l(a) = 0 for the case of radial symmetry. combining (3.49) with (3.44),

we obtain, for l  0,

gl = (1)m il eil (2al)1 [(ka/2)l+/2/(l + 1 + /2)

1 l (l + /2) (ka/2)(l+/2)]  (1 + o(k2, 2

iv. low energy phase shifts

in order to calculate (2.12) in the limit m2  0 the leading energy-dependent behavior

of sl,l is required. the case of central elds is dealt with rst.

a. central fields

the calculation of l in (3.42) proceeds by matching the log-derivatives l = rr ln l at

r = a, where again we can set a = r.. then (3.43) gives

tan l =

ljw (ka)  kajw (ka)
lyw (ka)  kay w (ka)

,

where l denotes l (inside). for ka  1 this reduces to

l = 

w  l
w + l

(ka/2)2w

(w )(w + 1)

(1 + o(ka)2) ,

(4.1)

(4.2)

for w = |l  /2| 6= 0, 1, ... results for integer values of w will be given below.

18

now suppose l  1. then (3.35) reduces to
l = /2  l + 2 bl1 al/<

l (k, a) + k2[(/2  l  l) l(a)  (rrl)a] + o(k4) . (4.3)

from (3.6), (3.24) and (3.26),

l (k, a)/2 = fl(a)(1 + k2l(a) + o(k4)) ,
<

which, together with (3.51) and (4.3), gives

l = /2  l +

a2l

0 dr r2l1 e2(r)  k2 al(a) + o(k4) .
r a

note that l  l as l  , as it should.

next, let l  0. equations (3.6), (3.24) and (3.26) give

l = /2  l + k2 al(a) + o(k4) ,

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

since fl = 0 for l  0 by (3.51). equations (3.42), (4.2), (4.5) and (4.6) determine the
leading energy dependence of the phase shifts for w 6= 0, 1, ...

finally, let w = 0, 1, ... there is nothing new in principle here; only the expansion of

yw for ka  1 has to be modied. the whole calculation goes forward as above with the
result that for w = 2, 3, . . . , l is still given by (4.2); for w = 1 replace o(ka)2 in (4.2) by

o((ka)2 ln(ka)), and for w = 0,

l =



2 ln(ka)

+ o(1/ ln2(ka)) .

(4.7)

it is interesting that the energy dependence of l for w = 0 specialized to l = 0 is exactly

the same as that derived by chandon et al. [18] for a large class of non-magnetic schrodinger

operators in 2+1 dimensions. note that there is no smooth interpolation of l from w 6= 0
to w = 0. this case will, therefore, have to be considered seperately in what follows.

19

b. general fields

the s-matrix sl,l appearing in (3.8) is obtained from

sl,l = l,l + 2 il1xm z 

0

dr r jl(kr) vlm(r) m,l(k, r) ,

(4.8)

with l,l given by (3.6) and (2.8) and where

vlm(r) =

1

2 z 2

0

d v (r, ) ei(lm) ,

(4.9)

with v as in (2.9). an innite set of coupled equations must be solved to extract the phase

shifts in the general eld case.

in practice, only a few o-diagonal elements of sl,l are

required to obtain the phase shifts in the low energy limit.

consider an incident low-energy particle (ka  1) with angular momentum l with respect
to the scattering center. it will encounter a high centrifugal barrier (l  /2)2/r2 to the
spatially asymmetric region r < a where b(r, ) 6= 0. for values of l  /2 the barrier
is minimized, and so we expect the magnitude of the energy-dependent corrections to the

aharonov-bohm phase shifts, l, will assume their maximum values, as (4.2) and (4.7)

illustrate in the centrally symmetric case. the intuition is that sl,l only has signicant

o-diagonal elements for values of l, l clustered about /2 and that otherwise sl,l can be

assumed diagonal with small error.

to test this hypothesis we will assume that

l <


2

< l + 1 ,

(4.10)

and take sl,l to be a 2  2 matrix to include the transitions l  l + 1, and diagonal
otherwise. this s-matrix can be calculated for all  satisfying (4.10) using the results of

20

the previous sections. as one would expect, the mixing of angular momentum states l

and l + 1 is maximum at the mid-interval value /2 = l + 1/2. instead of reproducing

this calculation it is more instructive to set /2 = l + 1/2, where the hankel functions

assume a simple form, and show that l and l+1 have the same energy dependence as

in the centrally symmetric case; only the numerical coecients are modied. in the case

of higher order transitions |l| > 1 involving larger matrices, we nd that the relevant
mixing parameters (see below) compared to the |l| = 1 case are smaller by factors of
order k|l|1.

the calculation begins by noting that the potential in (2.9) is not time-reversal invariant

for a xed magnetic eld. therefore, sl,l is not symmetric. we choose the parameterization

s = 


e2il cos 2

iei sin 2

iei sin 2 e2il+1 cos 2




,

(4.11)

where we expect the mixing parameter  to vanish as k  0. unitarity requires  and  to
be real with

 +  = 2(l + l+1) .

(4.12)

the denition of the phase shifts in (4.11) is that of stapp et al. [19], generalized here to

include t -violation. referring to (3.42) we can rewrite (4.11) as

s = 


e2i(l/4) cos 2

iei(l+l+1+) sin 2

iei(l+l+1) sin 2 e2i(l+1+/4) cos 2

,

(4.13)




which introduces a real t -violating parameter . from (3.8) and (4.12) with /2 = l+1/2,

the matching of the interior and exterior log-derivatives at r = a gives

l,l =

1/2 + e2ilkah (+) 
kah () 
h ()
1/2 + e2ilh (+)

1/2 cos 2

1/2 cos 2

,

(4.14)

21

with l+1,l+1 = l(l  l+1). also

l,l+1 = l+1,l = kah (+) 

1/2 /h (+)
1/2 .

recalling that

(4.13) becomes,

l,l =

h ()

1/2 (z) = is 2

( 1
2 + ika) e2ika + ( 1

to get the interior values of l,l, refer to (3.35). then

l,l = /2  l +

2  al bl1,l
<
l,l(k, a)

+ o(ka)2 .

from (3.6) and (3.36) - (3.38),

l,l(k, a)/2 = fl,l(a) + o(ka)2 ,
<

so that

(4.15)

(4.16)

,

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

l,l = /2  l +

al bl1,l
fl,l(a)

(1 + o(ka)2) + o(ka)2 .

(4.21)

referring back to (3.23), (3.37) and (3.40) it follows that, for l > 0,

fl,l(a) =

1

2 al z a

0

dr rlz 2

0

d ei(1l) e2(r,) 
xm=0

bm,l rm eim .

(4.22)

in the sum over bm,l in (4.22), only bl1,l and bl,l are nonzero as seen from (3.8), (3.35) and

(4.13) since mixing is only assumed for l  l + 1. then (4.21) and (4.22) give

dr r2l1z 2

d e2(r,) +

repeating the above steps we nd

(4.24)

we now calculate the ratios of bl,l in (4.23) and (4.24). from (3.35),

2 al bl1,l = (l,l + l  /2) >

l,l(k, a) (1 + o(ka)2) .

(4.25)

then (4.25), (4.15) and (4.18) give

bl,l/bl1,l =

(l,l  1

l+1,l(k, a)
2 ) >

l,l(k, a)

(1 + o(ka)2) .

(4.26)

equations (3.8), (4.13) and (4.16) give

l+1,l(k, a)/>
>

l,l(k, a) =

ei(l+l+1l) sin 2
e2ika  e2il cos 2

.

(4.27)

likewise,

bl1,l+1/bl,l+1 =

(ika  1) a >
2 ) >

(l+1,l+1 + 1

l,l+1(k, a)
l+1,l+1(k, a)

(4.28)

>
l,l+1(k, a)/>

l+1,l+1(k, a) =

ei(l+l+1+l) sin 2

e2il+1 cos 2  e2ika .

(4.29)

then solving (4.23), (4.26) and (4.27) for l,l and matching the result with l,l in (4.17)

gives

(1 + ika) e2ika il + (ika  1) il e2il cos 2 =

e2il cos 2  e2ika + ika jl ei(l+l+1l) sin 2 + o((ka)3, (ka)2l) ,

(4.31)

similarly, (4.24), (4.28), (4.29) and (4.17) with l replaced with l+1 give

ika (e2ika + e2il+1 cos 2) il+1 =

e2il+1 cos 2  e2ika(1  ika) j 

l ei(l+l+1+l) sin 2 + o((ka)3, (ka)2l+1) .

(4.32)

equations (4.30) and (4.32) can be solved for l, l+1,  and  with

 = 0 + 1ka + o((ka)2) .

(4.33)

the results are

l = ka/(1 + il) + o((ka)3)
l+1 = [il+1  1  (cos 0imjl  sin 0rejl)2/(1 + il)] ka + o((ka)3)

0 = cos 0rejl + sin 0imjl

1 = 0

 = (1)l (sin 0rejl  cos 0imjl) ka/(1 + il) + o((ka)2) .

(4.34)

note that l and l+1 have the same energy dependence as in the centrally symmetric case

given by (4.2).

v. chiral limit

we concluded in sec. iv that general magnetic elds only modify the numerical coe-

cients of the energy-dependent part of the phase shifts calculated in the centrally symmetric

24

case. it was also noted that the o-diagonal elements of sl,l fall o as powers of k. there-

fore, inhomogenous elds of the type considered here do not result in special cases that are

not already included in the central symmetry limit. we therefore conne our discussion to

central symmetry from here on and proceed to show that (1.1) is true by demonstrating

that the integral in (2.12) satises

(5.1)

this integral can be divided between contributions from the regions r < a and r > a. we

may set a = r.

a. r < a

by inspection, the term |0|2 in (5.1) gives a contribution proportional to ln[(m 2 +
m2)/m2] and so vanishes in the indicated limit. this leaves an integral over partial waves

obtained by substituting (3.1) in (5.1). we can obtain a bound on l(k, r) for all l from (3.26)

and (3.52) with bl1, gl xed by (3.46)-(3.47) and (3.49), respectively. these equations and

where /2 = n + f , 0 < f < 1 and n = 0, 1, ... next (5.6) has to be integrated over k

are continuous on [a, b]. if f never changes sign on [a, b] then, for some c in [a, b],

(5.7)

the value  = 0 is excluded since the energy integral is manifestly r- dependent. the t-

integral in (5.5) can be done immediately, resulting in an overall factor of ln[(m 2 + m2)/m2].

it remains to be shown that the integration over r is bounded. the denition of g in (5.6)

for large argument gives

the leading term, although oscillating, is bounded and that is all that is required to satisfy

the limit indicated in (5.1). for the special case when /2 = 1, 2, .. the sum in (5.6) is

zero.

next we consider the jw yw terms in (5.5). since j 2

w (kz)+y 2

w (kz) is a decreasing function

of z for any value of w [23], then for r  a,

w (kr)  j 2

w (ka) + y 2

it follows that

(5.10)

(5.11)

where we used |jw (z)|  1 for w  0. from (4.2) together with (4.5), (4.6) and (3.56) one
obtains for all l and /2 6= 1, 2, . . .

(5.12)

where the o(k2) terms fall o for large |l| at least like 1/|l|. since ka  1 and

every term in the series on the left-hand side of (5.11) is bounded by a constant

23/2 (cid:16)ea||b||/ + 1(cid:17) (ma/2)w

(w + 1)

,

for all r > a and 0  k  m. it is, therefore, a uniformly covergent series of continuous
functions of k and can be integrated term by term. applying the weighted mean value

dominated by a constant whose l-dependence is (a/2)2|l|/(|l!|)2 for all r > a. for all nite

hl(l) = |l|

(5.15)

which, together with (5.12),

implies hl(l) sin 2l() is dominated by a term whose l-

dependence is (a/2)2|l|/[(|l|  1)!]2 for all nite l and a  1. therefore the series
lp hl(l) sin 2l is uniformly and absolutely convergent for all nite values of l > a. but
it does not necessarily converge to a function continuous at the point l =  since hl(l) is
not continuous at l = . in fact, for xed l and l  1,
+ o(cid:18) 1

sin(2l  w )

hl(l) = 

l(cid:19) .

22

(5.16)

the remedy is now clear. consider instead the two series

xl "hl(l) +

sin(2l  w )

22

# sin 2l


1

22 xl

sin(2l) sin(2l  w ) .

now the limit l   and the sum can be interchanged in the rst series, giving zero. the
second series is bounded for all l > a, and so the limit in (5.1) is true for the jw yw terms.

the special case /2 = 1, 2, . . . requires (4.7) when l = /2. this results in a term

j0(kr) y0(kr)/ ln(ka), which is continuous for k on [0, m]. therefore the weighted mean

value theorem may be applied again to the k-integral, resulting in an overall factor of

ln[(m 2 + m2)/m2]. there remains an integration over r j0(r) y0(r) between a and l,

giving an oscillating but bounded term sin(2l) as l  . again, (5.1) is satised for this
special term.

finally, consider the last two terms in (5.5). note that

|y 2

w (kr)|  y 2
29

w (ka) + j 2

w (ka) ,

(5.17)

for r  a since j 2
0  k  m,

w (z) + y 2

w (z) is a decreasing function of z [23]. hence, for ka  1,

|y 2
w (kr)  j 2

w (kr)| sin2 l  (cid:16)ea||b||/ + 1(cid:17)2 (ma/2)2w

2(w + 1)

(1 + o((ma)2, (ma)2w )) , (5.18)

so that the sum over l of the terms on the left-hand side of (5.18) converges uniformly for

all r  a, 0  k  m. as it is also a sum of continuous functions of k for 0  k  m it can
be integrated term by term over k. application of the weighted mean value theorem gives

for some  in the interval 0 <   m. for |l|  /2 each term in the series (5.19) is
dominated by a r- independent constant whose l-dependence is (a/2)2|l|/(|l!|)2, for r  a
and a  1. it is therefore a uniformly convergent series of continuous functions for all
nite l > a that can be integrated term by term. entry 5.54.2 in ref.21 gives

the rst series is a sum of continuous functions for all l > a. it is also a uniformly and

absolutely convergent series for l > a, rst because |jw|  1 and, secondly, the combi-
w sin2 l and yw 1 yw +1 sin2 l are dominated by l-independent constants whose
nations y 2

l-dependence is (a2)2|l|/(|l|!)2 for |l|  /2. hence the limit l   and the sum can
be interchanged in the rst series, giving zero. the second series is bounded for all l > a,

verifying (5.1) for the last series of terms in (5.5).

the special case /2 = 1, 2 . . . is dealt with in the same way as in the case of jw yw sin l

and gives a contribution that vanishes in the limit indicated in (5.1). thus, (1.1) is demon-

strated.
