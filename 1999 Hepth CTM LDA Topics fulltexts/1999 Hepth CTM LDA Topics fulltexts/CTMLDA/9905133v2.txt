abstract

the 2-dimensional space-time sine-gordon eld theory is extended algebraically
within the ndimensional space of extended complex numbers. this eld theory
is constructed in terms of an adapted extension of standard vertex operators. a
whole set of non-local conserved charges is constructed and studied in this frame-
work. thereby, an algebraic non-perturbative description is possible for this n  1
parameters family of quantum eld theories. known results are obtained for spe-
cic values of the parameters, especially in relation to ane toda eld theories.
dierent (dual)-models can then be described in this formalism.

1 introduction

in most domain of physics, probably related to the bilinear aspects of fundamental ob-
jects such as quadratic metric, commutators, anticommutators, etc...algebras induced by
bilinear relations have a special status. cliord algebras of polynomials of degree higher
than two [1, 2] have been constructed thirty years ago by mathematicians. within this
family, the natural algebraic extensions of the cliord and grassmann algebras [3, 4, 5],
lies the extensions of complex numbers [6, 7]. it leads to the corresponding extensions of
trigonometric functions, dubbed multisine functions.

it is thus natural to study some possible extensions of a eld theory described in terms
of c-valued vertex operators in its simplest (apparently) famous form, the sine-gordon
(sg) model, known for its integrability and early established boson-fermion duality prop-
erty [8, 9, 10]. for instance, toda and ane toda eld theories based on simply or
non-simply laced algebras are the natural simple lie group extension of the su(2) and
su(2) toda (tft) and ane toda eld theories (atft) [11], e.g. liouville and sg
models. however, vertex operators description of these lie algebras extensions remains
c-dependent.

independently, certain quantum eld theories (qfts) for which non-perturbative com-
putations are known admit an innite number of conservation laws [12, 13]. on the one
hand exact s-matrices in two dimensional models can be obtained from the yang-baxter
relations [14, 15] which are a direct consequence of the conservation of higher powers of
the momentum. on the other hand, in lower-dimensional quantum eld theory, some of
the postulates of the coleman-mandula theorem [16] can be relaxed in a non-trivial way :
non-local conserved charges [13] may appear that generate symmetries, characterized by
non-trivial equal-time commutation, or braiding relations [17]. the rst non-trivial one
alone xes almost completly the on-shell dynamics [13, 18]. the action of the generator of
the symmetry group on a multiparticle state is identied to the non-trivial comultiplica-
tion of the charges. a well-known example corresponds to the quantum group symmetry
algebra uq( sl2) associated to the sine-gordon model [19]. this symmetry is then su-
ciently restrictive to allow a non-perturbative solution of the theory : conservation of a
non-local charge imposes strong constraints on the s matrix. in addition, the whole set
of non-local conserved charges constitutes an innite dimensional non-abelian symmetry
of yang-baxter equations.
in particular, one nds the quantum group invariance as a
limiting case [20]. consequently, non-local conserved charges are very powerfull objects
appearing in many other eld theories [21, 22].

more recently, the interest in dierent integrable deformations of atft came from
their integrability and duality properties [23, 24] which can be used to pave the way
to the understanding of the electric-magnetic duality in four-dimensional gauge theories,
conjectured in [25] and developped in [26]. thereby non-perturbative analysis of the
spectrum and phase structure in supersymmetric yang-mills theory becomes possible.

in an earlier study [27] and elsewhere [28] we dened the multisine-gordon (msg)
models, a wide variety of n  1 parameters ({a},{a}) qfts, for two dierent types
of representations associated to the multicomplex algebra, called minimal and non-
minimal. for specic values of the multicomplex dimension and of the parameters,

2

we prooved the integrability of dierent cases (for minimal  and non-minimal rep-
resentations) by constructing local conserved charges. in particular, we presented their
connections with dierent types of integrable deformations of the non-linear  model,
parafermionic sine-gordon model, etc...

the purpose of this paper is to investigate non-local charges algebras which may appear
in those quantum eld theories in 1 + 1 dimensions. using the multicomplex formalism,
we extend to these family of models the framework developped in the past for the sine-
gordon theory and more generally for ane toda eld theories [19]. this point of view
provides a new insight on apparently disconnected models.

in section 2, the mathematical formalism associated to the multicomplex algebra is
introduced. algebras and non-minimal representations properties (described in [28])
are briey recalled. the natural multicomplex extension of vertex operators is dened,
namely mc-vertex operators. the corresponding ope rules are then given.

section 3 opens with the formalism developped by zamolodchikov [29] and related to
the construction of conserved charges. the approach to be applied to the msg model
is then dened. a set of non-local multicomplex charges results if several constraints on
parameters are veried. the multicomplex algebra associated to these non-local charges
is explicitely found and characterized by a quantum deformation and the existence of a
topological term. the structure simplies when restricting the space of parameters to
({a}  rn/21, {a}  irn/22) for a specic (minimal or non-minimal) represen-
tation of multicomplex algebra in even n dimension. a whole set of non-local conserved
charges of the msg model is obtained. performing a restriction of these results leads to
informations about hidden symmetries for odd n dimensions.

2 ), uq(c (1)

some specic examples are studied in section 4 for a particular representation of
multicomplex algebra. for n = 3, it is shown that, for dierent values of parameters
0, 0 which identify msg(3|3) and msg(3|4) to a(1)
2 atfts, our
formula for the non-local charges algebra are in perfect agreement with known results
(uq(a(1)
2 ) respectively). similarly, for n = 4, dierent parameters
values give the connection with known results. a rst example is the restriction identied
to two sine-gordon models for which the non-local charges algebra decouples trivially in
a product of two uq( sl2) quantum envelopping algebras. an other choice of parameters
connects the msg with a(1)
3 atft and identies the corresponding non-local charges
algebra to uq(a(1)
3 ) quantum envelopping algebra. other restrictions are also considered.

2 multicomplex extension of vertex operators

here some basic properties of the multicomplex (mc) numbers are collected that are rele-
vant for the sequel, for more details one can see [6, 7]. the set of mc-numbers is generated

xiei, en = 1, xi  ir (cid:27)),
by one element e which satises en = 1 [6] (imi lc n = (cid:26)x =
and constitute a ndimensional commutative algebra. it is worth stressing that most of
the results of usual complex mumbers analysis remains true for mc-numbers, were it be

pi=0

introducing x(l) =

xiqilei, the conjugate of order l of x(0), (q = exp(2i/n)), one

may dene the pseudo-norm [6, 7] kxkn =
exponential form

x(l) and, if kxk 6= 0, x can be written in an

for algebraic [6] or analytic properties [7].

tions [6] x =  exp(cid:18)n1
pi=1

of course, due to the multivaluedness of the logarithm function the s are not unique.
then, it becomes straightforward to dene the extension of the usual trigonometric func-
musi()ei. these functions have properties anal-
ogous to the usual sine and cosine functions [6]. however, the parametrisation in terms
of  given in [6, 7] is inconvenient to derive explicit formulas for the multisine func-
tions. from the properties of e in its matrix representation (see [6]) it is easy to see that
ei + eni (resp. ei  eni) are represented by pure imaginary (real) matrices, and, hence
iei one can extract e(n/2) compact directions and
among the n  1 directions in
n  1  e(n/2) non-compact ones (e(x) denotes the integer part of x). for instance,
pa=0 (cid:20)apa + a(p 2
a )(cid:21),
performing the change of basis, we have for even n
n(cid:21)ej. for odd n, the

with pa (a = 0,   , n/2  1) given by pa = 2
generators are slightly dierent, however in the following sections we shall not need their
explicit expressions.

the multisine functions related to the lowest n  n matrix representation are in this
sense the minimal ones that can be dened. however, using higher dimensional matrix
realizations of imi lc n other series for the multisine functions are also allowed [28]. for
instance, if the natural embedding, imi lc n  imi lc m is used, n < m with any m when n is
m,iei the
odd, and even m when n is even. denoting em = (1)m exp(m), with m =
generators of imi lc m, one may dene e(n|m) = (1)n exp( m
n . it is easy to
see that e(n|m) generates imi lc n. furthermore, dening the multisine functions built from
the e(n|m), with the e(n|m) understood as an element of imi lc m, it is clear that the multisine
functions so obtained satisfy an equation of degree m instead of n. in other words, the
multisine of order n can be constructed from linear combinations of the multisine of order
m. it is not dicult to derive the relation fullled by the multisine functions obtained
in the m  m matrix realization. indeed, one can immediately see that with such an
embedding e(n|m) is represented by a diagonal matrix with (q1/2, q1/2) repeated m0 times,
(q3/2, q3/2) m1 times, etc... the mis  1 depend of course of m and n 1. the relation
obeyed by the multisine functions in the non-minimalcase can then be easely obtained.

n  m)  (em)

pi=1

1more generally, one can consider other higher dimensional representations, which cannot always be

understood along the lines of the embedding, i.e. when m0  1, m1  1, etc... are arbitrary numbers.

4

of course, if all the mis are equal to the same single value p we obtain nothing new.
this just comes from the embedding imi lc n  imi lc pn. as a consequence, lc  imi lc 2n
leads always to the usual sine and cosine functions. finally, the explicit formulas for the
multisine functions obtained from the (m0 + m1 +    )  (m0 + m1 +    ) dimensional
matrix representation are the same as those obtained in the minimal case. the only
dierence appears in the constraint among the non-compact variables (resulting from the
unity condition on the determinant value) [27, 28].

the standard vertex operators are dened by the expressions

(anti-holomorphic part) with   c.

j = exp(i(z))
in

(holomorphic part) and
analogy the following writtings are introduced :

j  = exp(i(z))

denition 1 : the n-multicomplex extension of the vertex operators, namely mc-

vertex operators 2 is dened as :

j(k) = j (k) = exp(cid:16)(k).(z)(cid:17)
j (k) = j (k) = exp(cid:16)(k).(z)(cid:17)

(holomorphic part),

(2)

(anti-holomorphic part),

where k = 0, ..., n  1 and ((z), (z)) are holomorphic and anti-holomorphic part of
a n component vector eld (z, z) 3. the euclidian light-cone coordinates are (z, z) as
z = i(x + t)/2 and z = i(t  x)/2. by convention, we have d2z = idzdz = idxdt/2. the
expression (k).(z)
(k).(z) ) is dened in the next paragraphs as it depends
on the parity of n.

(resp.

even multicomplex extension

if the dimension n of the multicomplex space is even, the holomorphic part (and

similarly for the anti-holomorphic part) [27, 28] are dened as :

n

2 1

(k).(z) =

xa=0 (cid:20)apa+ka(z) + a(p 2
2 1+k;0p 2

(k) = [0pk, ...,  n
(z) = [0(z), ...,  n

2 1+k],

where

(3)

(4)

are n multicomplex components vectors, with ({a},{a}) the extensions of the complex
parameter  in j. the n-multicomplex algebra of the generators pa is dened, for
(a, b, k)  [0, ..., n/2  1], as :

2vertex operators are always implicitely normal-ordered.
3strictly speaking, we cannot write  =  +  because the zero mode would be duplicated in this
process. however, the zero mode is absorbed in the denition of . then, the full vertex operator
decomposes into a product of left and right chiral vertex operators.

for example, one faithful representation  is given by (n  n) dimensional diagonal ma-
trices:

hpai = diag(0, ..., 0, i, 0, ..., 0,i, 0, ..., 0)
with i(resp.  i) is in the a (resp. n  1  a) position,
e.g. (hpa+ki)

(a, k)  [0, ..., n/2  1] and j  [0, ..., n  1].

for

jj

= (hpa+ki)n1j,n1j where  denotes the ordinary hermitian conjugate,

for a  [0, ..., n/2  1],

(6)

as indicated in [27, 28], to obtain unimodular n-multicomplex numbers, it is necessary
to have a constraint over the n/2 non-compact elds a which restricts the independent
degrees of freedom of the theory from n to n  1 :

2 1 = 0.
then, with the constraint (7), expression (3) is modied as :

extension of any standard vertex operator. relations (12) explicitely show the depen-
dence on the subspace dimension ma. for simplicity, we shall work without specifying a
representation except when studying particular cases.

odd multicomplex extension

from the above results in the n even case, one can deduce similar expressions for odd

n of the multicomplex space. in fact, the unimodular constraint for odd n is given by :

and the compact component  n1

the calculation of ope between two dierent n-mc-vertex operators is in keeping with

related to the kinetic terms are chosen : < a(z)b(w) >=  ln(z  w)a,b (for (a, b)

the same form if the substitutions (14) are used.

however, for later convenience, a normalization for mc-vertex operators in keeping
with ane toda eld theories will sometimes be used in next sections. namely, roots ri
for i = 0, ..., r of ane lie algebras (r denotes the rank of the algebra) are convention-
nally normalized as r2
i = 2 for simply laced cases whereas for non-simply laced cases only
long roots have this property. as the atft potential is expressed in terms of vertex
operators exp ri. : the associated non-local conserved currents are generally dened
by exp ri /. with ri = 2ri/r2
i denoting the coroots. moreover, using the linear inde-

whereas for n odd, it is sucient to have eq. (i) in (19) for all a  [0, ..., (n  1)/2  1]
and { a / a 6= 0}.
consequently, c k,k(, ) is invertible for even n if parameters ({a},{a}) satitisfy
(19). then, in analogy the normalized or dual roots for the mc-vertex operator are
dened as :

(k) = 2(k)((k).(k))1.

(16), (18) and (19), we have (k) = 2(k)(c k,k(, ))1. finally, using

3 non-local conserved charges in the multisine-gordon

model

using the framework of mc-vertex operators for the multisine-gordon model, an explicit
construction of a set of non-local conserved charges is achieved, preceded by a short review
of the model. a brief review of the method is rst presented.

3.1 perturbed cft and non-local charges

this section presents the analysis used to construct non-local charges and to nd their
algebraic properties. consider a conformal eld theory perturbed by a relevant scalar
operator. its action writes :

a = acf t +



2 z d2zpert.(z, z).

(23)

the dimensionfull parameter  measures the strength of the perturbation away from the
critical point ( = 0). in the conformal limit, the chiral elds o(z, z) and o(z, z) satisfy
the equations zo(z, z) = zo(z, z) = 0. it is then possible to deduce the equations of
motion to rst order in perturbation theory for the perturbed chiral elds in the perturbed
cft following zamolodchikovs approach [29] :

zo(z, z) = iz
zo(z, z) = iz

a

dw
2i
dw
2i

pert.(w, z)o(z, z),
pert.(z, w)o(z, z).

(24)

furthermore, if j a(z, z) and j

(z, z) are identied with local or non-local conserved
currents of the perturbed cft, they should satisfy the following equations of motion to
rst order in perturbation theory :

zj a(z, z) = zh a(z, z),
zj
(z, z).

(z, z) = zh

a

a

(25)

it is clear that these currents become chiral (resp. anti-chiral) at the critical point 4.
these currents are chosen to be local with respect to the perturbing eld. however,
it is seen that eqs.
(25) can only be satised if the residue of the ope between the
currents and the perturbing eld leads to derivatives terms in the r.h.s. of eqs. (24).
thus, if this strong constraint is veried and supposing that the perturbing eld can be
expanded as pert. = (0)
pert.(z), one obtains
(holomorphic part) :

pert. +... with (l)

pert.(z, z) = (l)

pert. +...+(l)

pert.(z)(l)

h a(z, z) = ha(z)(l)

pert.(z)

with zha(z) = reszw((l)

pert.(w)j a(z))

(26)

and similarly for the anti-holomorphic part. finally, the currents generate conserved
charges which are dened by :

qa =

1

2i(cid:18)iz

dzj a +iz

dzh a(cid:19) and q

a

=

1

2i(cid:18)iz

a

dzj

+iz

dzh

a(cid:19).

(27)

clearly, this approach holds for local or non-local conserved charges. if our interest is in
non-local conserved currents, non-trivial relations may appear between them, encoded in
their equal-time braided relations of the form :

j a
(x, t)j b

(y, t) = rab

dcj c

(y, t)j d

(x, t).

(28)

4for example, it is well known that the stress-energy tensor looses its chirality property in the vicinity

of the critical point.

10

integrability and associativity properties of the theory require the matrix rab
dc to be a
solution of the yang-baxter equations. considering now the action of the charges on the
physical hilbert space, similar relations are obtained between the charges and the elds of
the theory. in fact, the action of the currents on a eld, say (y), is characterized by the
integration contour surrounding the point y. moreover, non-locality can be represented
by a string attached to the current from x  , then, braiding relations arise from the
obstructions in moving these strings [20]. it leads to a non-trivial algebra for the non-local
conserved charges characterized by braided commutator relations of the form (described
in gure 1):

the r.h.s. is always identied as a topological term corresponding to a generalization
of the topological extensions of supersymmetry in two dimensions. finally, the action
of the charges on a multiparticle states follows similar rules and is associated to the co-
multiplication (qa). we shall identify next and explicitely the dierent mathematical
objects just presented. for more details about these points, see [17, 19, 20, 21].

3.2 application to the multisine-gordon model

as already studied in a previous paper, the multisine-gordon model based on unimodular
multicomplex numbers describes a family of n 1 parameters quantum eld theories with
n1 scalar elds which interact through a multisine potential [27, 28]. in two dimensions,
for some specic values of the coupling parameters ({a},{a}) and of the multicomplex
space dimension n, the model is integrable at quantum level. however, this model seems
not to be integrable classically except for specic values of the parameters 5.

5as seen later, it can be identied for n = 4 to a(1)

3 atft with imaginary coupling constant which

possesses classical soliton solutions obtained, for example, by hirota method [31, 32].

denition 2 : the euclidian action of the multisine-gordon model associated to the

multicomplex algebra 6 msg(n|m) is dened by :

with :

x(l) = exp(cid:16)(l).(z, z)(cid:17)

(30)

(31)

where j = (a + a) for (j, a)  [(0, 0), ..., (e(n/2 1), e(n/2 1))] and j = (a + a)
for (j, a)  [(e(n/2), 0), ..., (n 2, e(cid:16)(n + 1)/2(cid:17)  2)]. for example, in the representation

(6) for even n the following expression [27, 28] is obtained :

mus0() =

2

n(cid:18)

n/22

xa=0 (cid:20) cos aaeaa(cid:21) + cos n/21n/21e(cid:16)pn/22

a=0

a

ma

mn/21

a(cid:17)(cid:19).

(32)

for odd n, a similar expression results with substitutions7 (14).

in the deep ultraviolet limit, the mass scale parameter  goes to zero. normal ordering
is used to remove divergences from tadpoles. however, if a fermionic representation 8 is
prefered, depending on the value of n, some specic counterterms can be added [27, 28], the
coupling parameters are thereby unrenormalized. with the above choice of normalization
of the kinetic term, the euclidian propagator is dened as :

< i(z, z)j(w, w) >= 2 ln|z  w|i,j

for (i, j)  [0, ..., n  2]

(33)

the action (30) is now considered as a perturbation of a conformal eld theory in the
sense of the previous subsection. in fact, the multisine potential is treated as a pertur-
bation of the conformal eld theory associated to n  1 free bosons. however, following
zamolodchikov, it is assumed that the space of elds has not been drastically modied
by the perturbation. a one-to-one correspondence can then be established between the
local operators of the multisine-gordon model and the elds of the ultra-violet cft. in
the massless limit, each n  1 components of the free vectorial boson can be decomposed
into one holomorphic and one anti-holomorphic part (z, z) = (z) + (z). each mc-
vertex operators of the ultraviolet cft can then be written as a product of two chiral
(anti-chiral) mc-vertex operators and of their virasoro descendents too.

in the spirit above, it follows that the existence of an hypothetical conserved current
in the multisine-gordon model is clearly related to the ope between this current and the

6particulary, as explained in section 2, embeddings imilc n  imilc m may be considered.
7stricktly speacking, for odd n a coecient appears before the last vertex operator in (32). however,

it can be absorbed by a convenient shift over the elds.

8for small a, one can use 2-d fermion-boson correspondence [8] to rewrite the action (30) in a form

more suitable for perturbative analysis.

12

perturbing eld. let us then use the formalism of mc-vertex operators to construct this
quantity.

it is supposed rst that the conserved current belongs to the multicomplex space and
the expansion of the multisine functions in terms of x(l) is identied as the perturbing
eld. using the ope (15) for j (k)x(l) and eqs. (17), (31), the condition on the residue
related to eqs. (24), (25) amounts to a condition on the multicomplex coecient c k,l(, )
given by eqs. (18). the task is to nd a general set of solutions ({a},{a}) - associated
to the existence of non-local conserved currents - for the resulting system of constraints.
for later convenience (particulary to relate msg and atfts) it is preferable to use (k)
(dened in eqs. (20), (21)) instead of (k) as a possible solution. thereby, a convenient
normalization of multicomplex roots is ensured, and then of vertex operators as well.
in any case, the existence of conserved charges results from the following assumption :

proposition 1 : a set of 2n non-local multicomplex conserved currents associated to

the multisine-gordon theories exists if :

n/21

xa=0

c k,k(, ) =

2(cid:16)  p 2
for l 6= k with {nb}  r.

a(cid:17) = 2, and c k,l(, ) =

n/21

xb=0

b(cid:17),
nb(cid:16)  p 2

(34)

for even n, the form of the constraints is detailed in appendix a where particular solu-
tions, namely normalized are given, with ({a}  rn/21,{a}  irn/22) singled out.
other solutions, called unormalized, can also be obtained as shown in appendix d.

conserved currents for even n

choosing an appropriate set of parameters ({a},{a}), the only term of the per-
turbing eld which survives corresponds to l = k(mod(n)). however, another kind of
constraints exists for which the term with l = k + n/2(mod(n)) survives, but it corre-
sponds to the change of sign aa  aa and then gives an isomorphic set of conserved
currents, the natural complex conjugate one. after some computations, the equations for
the multicomplex non-local currents follow :

proposition 2 : in rst order of perturbation theory, the n (holomorphic) non-local

multicomplex conserved currents verify :

zj (k) = zh (k)

with

for k  [0, ..., n  1]
j (k) = exp(cid:16)(k).(z)(cid:17),

2

h (k) =

n (cid:18) exp(cid:16)((k) + (k)).(z) + (k).(z)(cid:17)(cid:19)

(35)

and similarly for the anti-holomorphic part with (  ). here (k) is given by eqs.
(17) (for unormalized solutions) or eqs. (17), (20), (21) ((k)  (k) for normalized
solutions) and similarly for the anti-holomorphic part; (k) is given by eqs. (17).

for k  [0, ..., n  1],

(36)

with j (k) and h (k) (resp. j (k) and h (k)) given in eqs. (35).

the non-locality of the multicomplex conserved charges results from the massless
limit where zj = zj = 0 and since z = x + t and z = x  t, it follows that
(x + t)j = (x + t)j = 2xj. this last equation gives the expression of the elds
(j, j) in a non-local way 9 in terms of the msg fundamental eld j:

j(x, t) =

j(x, t) =

1

dytj(y, t)(cid:19) for j  [0, ..., n  2],
dytj(y, t)(cid:19).

(37)

as explained above, eventhough these non-local expressions are derived in the massless
limit, they can be taken to dene the chiral components (j, j) in the perturbed theory.
from the expressions of vector (chiral, anti-chiral) elds (, ) in terms of the msg

bosonic vector eld  (37), of the equal-time canonical commutation relation

[i(x, t), j(y, t)] = ii,j

for all (x, y)

(38)

(since [i(x, t), tj(y, t)] = 4ii,j(xy)), expressions (18) and the abelian property of
the multicomplex algebra (5), the braiding properties of non-local multicomplex currents
are found as :

j (k)(x, t)j

(l)

(y, t) = exp(ic k,l(, ))j

(l)

(y, t)j (k)(x, t)

(39)

for all

(x, y) and (k, l)  [0, ..., n  1].

along similar lines and using constraint equations, it can be shown that :
proposition 3 : braiding relations between j (k), h (l) and h (k), j (l) are identical to

(39) i :

c k,l(, ) =

for l 6= k, with {nb}  z.

(40)

to rst order in perturbation theory, the calculation of the multicomplex topological term
q(k)(q(l)) exhibits only diagonal (l = k) contributions. it writes explicitely (compared to

e.g. :

h(k) = exp(cid:16)((k) + (k)).(z)(cid:17),

(41)

(42)

using (35), (36), (39), (41) and assuming relation (40) to be satised :

proposition 4 : i parameters ({a},{a}) satisfy eqs. (34) and (40), the algebra of

the 2n non-local conserved multicomplex charges is given by :

(l)

q(k)q

(l)

 q2
k,l q

q(k) = k,lt (k)

(43)

with the deformation

q2
k,l = exp(ic k,l(, )).

clearly the whole analysis is independent of any choice of representation for the multi-
complex algebra. in fact, at this point the msg model appears as a quantum eld theory
formulated in terms of multicomplex generators. the multicomplex conserved charges
have then also generic mc-expressions. dierent solutions to the constraint equations
are now envisaged.

restriction of parameters space

 restriction to ({a}  rn/21,{a}  irn/22) for even n

for this choice, several atfts enter in our study 10[28]. as explained in appendix a,
({a},{a}) should verify constraints related to eqs. (74) - for non-local conserved charges
to exist -. in appendix a, a trivial solution is also given with (k) = (k) = 2(k)((k))2,
e.g. a = a; a = a if (40) is satised. then, it follows :

proposition 5 : for ({a}  rn/21,{a}  irn/22), a normalized set of non-

local multicomplex conserved charges exists if :

ca,a+n/2(cid:16), (cid:17)  z

and

and

cn/21,a(cid:16), (cid:17)  z.

(44)

where the coecients ca,b(cid:16), (cid:17) are given in appendix a.

10in fact, due to the structure of the multicomplex algebra and parameters dependence, all ane lie

algebras (associated to the atft potential) can not obtained.

some simplications occurs in the r.h.s. of expression (43). first, with a eld 

conguration such that (x  , t) = 0, one may write :

zt

dxx exp(cid:16)((k) + (k)).(cid:17) = (cid:18)1  exp(cid:16)  ((k) + (k)).zt

dxx(cid:17)(cid:19).

(45)

(46)

(47)

a eld normalization can be chosen 11 such that e(2it (k))  1 provided there is no problem
around the boundaries. consequently :

qk = exp(2i(c k,k)1(, )) = exp(i/2(c k,k)(, )),

eq. (43) writes :

where :

q(k)q(l)  qcl,k(,)

q(l)q(k) = k,l

(48)

(49)

(50)

the value of the topological charge can then be found for any mc-vertex operator of

the form :

from (46). it is easy to show that :

v (l) = exp(cid:16)(l). +

(52)

t (k)v (l) = h(k).((l)

)iv (l)

= hc k,l(, )  c k,l(, )iv (l).

in particular, for v (l)  (cid:16)j (l), h (l)(cid:17) and with (35), the topological charge of the non-

local multicomplex conserved charges writes now (an opposite sign occurs for the anti-
holomorphic part) :

c l,k(, ) q(l),

(53)

ht (k), q(l)i =
ht (k), q

(l)i =  c l,k(, ) q

(l)

.

11for the sg model, the normalization condition is xed by the periodicity of the perturbing term

cos(0).

16

hence, it follows that :

proposition 6 : for {a}  rn/21 and {a}  irn/22, eqs. (48), (49) and (53)
with assumption (40) describe the algebra of non-local multicomplex charges of the msg
model to lowest order in perturbation theory i eqs. (34) and (40) are satised.

using a scaling argument, it can be checked that this algebra is exact to all order in

perturbation theory (following [19]).

in a forthcoming publication we shall discuss how this algebra can be obtained as one

basis of the natural multicomplex extension of uq( sl2(lc )).

3.3 representation of msg theories and non-local charges al-

gebra (even n)

in [27, 28], our attention focused on the msg model in the representation (6) and its
numerous links with known qfts. a few remarks are in order to keep only relevant
informations from multicomplex non-local charges construction given by eqs. (36) if we
consider the model associated to this representation. the algebra of non-local conserved
charges is obtained as follows : representation (6) is retained (the action (30) is real-
valued since only the complex number i appears through cos aa) and the aim is to
obtain directly the charges in terms of standard complex numbers. in other words, for
the representation (6), the multisine function is clearly multiplied by the (n  n) identity
matrix. then, in this representation, each component of the non-local multicomplex
charges veries the algebra (43). it is easy to see, from eqs. (18), (36) that the component
(00) of the multicomplex charge q(kj) veries the same algebra as that of the component
(jj) of the multicomplex charge q(k) for (k, j)  [0, ..., n/2  1] (similarly for the anti-
holomorphic charges). therefore, an isomorphism between these dierent components
exists which allows keeping all the same one component of all the non-local multicomplex
charges as a set of non-local conserved charges of the msg theory in this representation.
hence, the choice of a specic component is irrelevant here.

a complete set of non-local conserved charges of the msg in representation (6) can
then be built since the restriction of the space of non-local multicomplex charges reduces
to n copies of it.

for even n, let us still consider the representation (6) of the multicomplex algebra.

the (diagonal) components verify :

(hp 2

ai)jj = a,j

for

(a, j)  [0, ..., n/2  1].

(54)

only one component, say the rst, (jj) = (00) can be retained. dening the non-
associated to j (a) for

(normalized or unnormalized).

(59)

(60)

all these results can be extended to the family of qfts for odd n values : this is
reported in appendix c since it comes directly from straightforward restrictions of the
even n case. in the next section several applications are given, showing perfect agreement
with known results, atfts ones for example.

4 examples

dierent examples are now treated using representation (6). for n = 2, the model is
denoted msg(2|2)(0) : there is only one generator p0 as p 2
0 = 1 and it is isomorphic
to the standard complex number. from eqs. (17), (30) and (31), this model corresponds
to the standard sine-gordon model, with only one parameter 0, all the non-compact
parameters a disappearing. in this case, the system of constraints related to eqs. (74),
(75) and (76) gives the trivial solution 0 = 0. using (56), the following algebra for the
non-local charges is immediate :

dxx exp(cid:16)i(

(63)

in full agreement with the results of d. bernard and a. leclair [19] concerning the sine-

+

gordon model, with the identication : q(0) = q+ ; q(0) = q ; q(1) = q ; q(1) =
q
uq( sl2).

. this algebra is identied as the innite dimensional quantum envelopping algebra

4.1 msg(3|m)(0; 0)
for specic parameters and m = 3, 4, these models are integrable [27, 28]. the non-
local charges obtained for these qfts can be seen as a restriction to 1 = 0 of the
general msg(4|m)(0, 1; 0) model studied in the next subsection. for n = 3 their
associated algebra is described by eqs. (78) of appendix b. it can be easily checked that
dierent parameters lead to known atfts. for instance, the non-local charges algebras of
models msg(3|3)(

its connexion with the multicomplex formalism is discussed in [27]. it has a u(1)  u(1)
symmetry and its dynamics for 0 = 1 was studied in [24]. moreover, this model
possesses a dual representation in terms of an integrable deformation of the non-linear 
model.

let us now study particular cases and their underlying hidden symmetries associated

to the present approach.

 msg(4|4)(0, 1; 0)

for 0 = 0, this model reduces to two decoupled sg. for normalized currents,
constraint equations gives : 0 = 0 and 1 = 1. the algebra of non-local
conserved charges obtained in (56) simply decouples as a product of two subalgebras
uq0( sl2)  uq1( sl2) as in (61) for q0 = exp(2i/2

i=1 ri = [1, 1, 0] are the simple roots of the algebra
normalized as r2
i = 2. then, the equations for the existence of non-local conserved
charges associated to these parameters are obtained. for a normalized basis,
one general solution 13 is given by :
0 = i and 0 = 1 = . the dierent
deformations corresponding to the algebra of these non-local conserved charges are
given by eq. (64), where ca,b is nothing else than dierent elements of the extended
cartan matrix associated to a(1)
ane lie algebra. since it is known that the
3
quantum envelopping algebra uq(a(1)
3 ) can be described in the chevalley basis by :

[ha, eb] = ca,beb,
[ha, fb] = ca,bfb,
[ea, fb] = ab

(68)

(69)

(70)

with c some constant.
at this point, few remarks are in order. the a(1)
3 atft for imaginary coupling
i possesses topological soliton solutions which are in one-to-one correspondence
with the 3 fundamental representations of a(1)
[19, 32]. it is possible to choose a
3
soliton conguration for which (x  ) = 0 is satised. after some calculations,
the dierent topological terms can be expressed in terms of the cartan subalgebra
dened as n topological charges (not linearly independent) :

ha = 



2 zt

dxra.x for

a  [0, ..., 3].

in representation (6), the r.h.s. of eq. (43) becomes :

(71)

(72)

t (a) =



4i(cid:16)1  q2ha(cid:17)

for

a  [0, ..., 3].

0 = 0 or 

1 = 0, which correspond to non-local conserved currents

13the cases  

0 = 0 or 
subalgebras, are not considered.

22

the conclusive understanding is that the more general hidden symmetry obtained
from multicomplex framework is exactly identied to the quantum envelopping al-
gebra uq(a(1)

3 ) where q is given by (64).

 msg(4|4)(0, 0; 0)

the msg model then reduces to the sinh-gordon model for the coupling parameter
0. the non-local conserved charges symmetries simply reduce to the quantum
group algebra already seen for the msg(2|2) model but with an imaginary coupling
parameter.

remarks on other cases

the case msg(3|3)(0; 0) reduces to the bullough-dodd model for the coupling pa-
2 non-simply laced lie algebra with

rameter 0. it corresponds to the atft based on a(2)
generalized cartan matrix :

aab =   2 1
2 !

4

as already seen, one may proceed by analogy. here, the algebra of non-local conserved
charges (56) is identied to the quantum envelopping algebra uq(a(2)
2 ). from the expres-
sion of constraint equations, uq( sl2) is the corresponding algebra and another subalgebra
exists described by uq4( sl2) for q given by (64) with 0 = i.

this section closes with few words on an other example, the qft msg(5|6)(0, 1; 0, 1).

this qft is integrable for specic values of the parameters [28]. it possesses a large va-
riety of possible restrictions already analysed [24, 27, 28]. as done for n = 3, it can
be checked from (78) that subalgebras of non-local charges exist which describe known
quantum envelopping algebras. this theory admits a dual representation related to the
non-linear sigma model and to the massive thirring model coupled with atft [28].

5 discussion

this paper was concerned with the formulation of a large variety of quantum eld theories
depending on n  1 parameters in terms of the multicomplex algebra. this is done using
multicomplex extension of vertex operators. the essential benet of this framework is the
generic construction of a set of multicomplex non-local conserved charges with properly
dened normalized mc-vertex operators.

they satisfy a qdeformed algebra for several constraints on parameters. this is
done for any value of n, the dimension of the multicomplex space and any kind of rep-
resentation (imi lc n  imi lc m specically). then, for a specic choice of representation,
the multicomplex algebra relates msg theories to known quantum eld theories like, for
examples, pure and deformed ane toda models, parafermionic sine-gordon, integrable
deformations of non-linear sigma model, etc... for such known cases, perfect agreement

23

is found with results obtained in other frameworks. let us now discuss some points and
consider their eventual implications.

 quantization of msg theories and unitarity

for imaginary values of the parameters {a}, msg action is not real for real-valued
elds. clearly, at quantum level this is somewhat questionable. an analogous sit-
uation appears in atfts with coupling . for real values of , the structure of
the mass spectrum is such that a direct construction of a set of purely smatrices
is possible [11]. for imaginary  values, the situation is much more complicated :
at real-valued elds, the classical potential has discrete vacua. solitons exist which
connect these vacua and breathers of zero topological charge. although they do
not take real values, they have real energy and coupling [34]. one way to quantize
these theories uses the semi-classical approach, but to our knowledge, this scheme is
not completly satisfactory [35]. the alternative way consists in using the quantum
group symmetry uq( g) of atfts based on the ane lie algebra g. since topolog-
ical charges are generators of this algebra and transform non-trivially the solitons,
it is generally admitted that solitons-solitons smatrices are proportional to the
rmatrices of the symmetry algebra. this has been succesfully carried out for
various atfts. although nogeneral proof exists that smatrices for lowest mass
zero topological charge breathers are identical to the conjectured smatrices of the
lightest mass particle in the real coupling case (for   i), it is found to be so in
all cases. however, the smatrices for the fundamental solitons which result from
the qg method are not expected to be unitary (except for the sg model). indeed,
the issue of unitarity can be addressed directly at the level of the smatrix, using
qg or rsos restriction [36]. since for {a}  irn/22 the hamitonian of msg
theories is complex, the theory may be expected to be non-unitary. for integrable
cases, the two methods mentionned may be applied but as we saw, the quantum
group structure is strongly related to specic contraints on parameters.

 integrability of msg and smatrix

in atfts, the (innite-dimensional) quantum symmetry uq( g) implies quantum
integrability. it can be proved through the construction of an innite number of
commuting higher-spin conserved charges, provided by the innitly many casimir
operators of uq( g). in fact, this approach is an alternative way to establish quantum
integrability in atfts, as compared to the standard construction of local conserved
charges. this later approach was retained in [27], but it is natural to attempt the
rst one in msg theories. due to the simple algebraic structure of multicomplex
non-local conserved charges for ({a}  irn/22) described by eqs. (49) and (53),
one may be able, for specic parameters related to eq. (82), to extend these ideas to
msg theories. in particular, for the existence of fundamental multicomplex solitons
elds, coproduct rules and multicomplex rmatrices, it should be the ideal basis for
the construction of solutions of the yang-baxter equations associated to the msg
theories for ({a}  irn/22) and eq. (82) satised. to analyse these problems,
multicomplex extensions of sl2(c) will be considered in a forthcomming publication.

24

 subalgebras and restrictions of msg

a=0

a) as quantum envelopping subalgebras.

from constraint equations (see appendix a, eqs. (74)), specic values for ({a},{a})
do lead to well-identied subalgebras.
firstly, with a = 0 for all a, constraint equations (74) associated to normal-
ized mc-vertex operators reduce to the standard equations associated to non-
local conserved charges of the sine-gordon model with solutions : a =  2
.
a
uqa( sl2) with
then, each msg(n|m) model in representation (6) possesses e(n/21)
qa = exp(2i/2
consider for instance the case msg(4|4)(0, 1; 0). using these subalgebras, a
quantum group (qg) restriction is feasible with respect to the symmetry group
uq( sl2) with q = e2i/2
0. the corresponding qft gives the parafermionic sine-
gordon models [30, 33].
secondly, it follows from eqs. (74), (76) and (77) in appendix a that {a} = 0 can
be choosen as a solution for all a. any multicomplex identies to its conjugate,
hence only n/2 currents remain and n/2 currents are identical. furthermore, the
space of parameters is no longer restricted to ({a}  irn/22), a consequence of
eqs. (77).

although many dierent types of restrictions may be considered [24], their studies
are beyond the scope of this paper.

 restriction to {a}  rn/21 and {a}  rn/22

as explained in appendix d, for specic values of n, conserved currents can be
found. in particular, for n = 5 it is worth noting that the resulting charges possess
a form very similar to those appearing in [37]. the model studied there presents a
fermion-boson duality property. non-local conserved charges exchange fermion and
boson with the coupling. hence, it would be interesting to investigate an hypothetic
relation between duality transformation and multicomplex conjugation.

the conclusive message is that apparently disconnected models can be organized
in terms of multicomplex algebra. depending on the ratios of the coupling param-
eters, these models lead to known integrable qfts. a geometrical interpretation
can be given.
in the vicinity of the critical point, a multicomplex manifold m
characterized by {a},{a} exists. several embedded submanifolds correspond to
integrable qfts. it is then possible to identify dual algebras in atfts ( g  g)
as two dierent representations of multicomplex algebra. more generally, algebraic
duality could be understood as a geometrical (non-minimal) deformation of the
multicomplex space.

appendix a

conservation of non-local currents for even n

here, we explain how to prove the existence of non-local charges using the extension
of ope rules within the multicomplex formalism. if opes between j(k) and the holo-

morphic part (denoted h(.)) of a multicomplex vertex operator h(cid:16)x(l)(cid:17) = exp((l).(w)):

j (k)(z)x(l)(w)  (z  w)ck,l(,)e( (k)+(l)).(w) + ...

behave (see section 3.1) as :

j(k)(z)x(k)(w)  (z  w)2e( (k)+(k)).(w) + ...,
j(k)(z)x(l)(w)  (z  w)pe( (k)+(l)).(w) + ...

for other cases,

(73)

(74)

where p in the representation (6) is a n  n diagonal matrix with only real (or zero)

for ({a},{a}) 6= (0, 0), the trivial solutions {a} = {a} and {a} = {a} are only
possible if {a}  rn/21, {a}  irn/22 or {a}  irn/21, {a}  rn/22.
it
is easily understood from the structure of c k,l(, ) given by eq.
(76) compared to

consequently, for {a}  rn/21 and {a}  irn/22 we can choose  =  as a

for {a}  rn/21 and a  irn/22, the topological terms get simplify easily as shown
for the even n case. explicitely, for specic values of the parameters ({a},{a}) which
identify the corresponding msg model to atft based on lie algebra g, it can be ex-
pressed in terms of the cartan subalgebra of g, the dual ane lie algebra of g.

appendix c

from eqs. (76), it is possible to dene a deformed version similar to the standard

cartan matrix where the deformation is characterized by parameters ({a}  rn/21,{a} 
irn/22). the cartan matrix of the ane lie algebra g is dened as :

aab =

where ra, rb are simple roots associated to the ane lie algebra g. we similarly dene

as for the standard cartan matrix, we aect a node indexed (a) to each value of a 
[0, ..., n/21]. however, for n/21 = 0, cn/21,n1(, ) = cn/21,n/21(, ) = 2, so one
sees that conserved currents j (n/21) = j (n1). similarly, the two nodes ((n  1)/2) and
(n) are identical for odd n. this can be generalized as follows : each time we have a = 0,
the two nodes (a) and (a + n/2) collapse together. this results from the multicomplex
symmetry between pa  pa+n/2 = pa, relating one node (a) and its conjugate (a+n/2),
which disappears for a = 0.
a crucial condition to obtain a quantum group symmetry for (49) corresponds to
ca,b(, )  z for (a 6= b)  [0, ..., n/2  1]. we may ask for which values of parameters
it can be satised and then, how the resulting dynkin diagrams look like. we have studied
the cases n = 3 and n = 4.

 multicomplex dimension n = 3

for eq. (81) to be satised, we choose 2

c0,1(, ) = c2,1(, ) =

deformed algebra associated tounormalized solutions

 a solution for unormalized mc-vertex operators (n = 4, 5)

since the dierent generators of the multicomplex algebra verify (5) and are linearly inde-
pendent, we have to nd a solution - associated to the existence of a non-local conserved
currents parametrized by ({a},{a)} - to the following system of constraints (using
(18) for unormalized vertex operators). for even n :

(cid:18)  aa + aa(cid:19) = 2,
(cid:18)aa + aa(cid:19)  z,

for instance, one obvious solution is given by :

however, as ma

mn/21  z+, it is only possible for n = 4 in the minimal representation

= 1). for odd n, we set (14). it gives the solutions :

which can be only satised for n = 5 i m0

then, for n = 4, 5, we may choose unormalized mc-vertex operators as a convenient
basis of hypothetical non-local conserved currents : instead of the normalized basis, we
are not forced here to restrict the space of parameters. in fact, whereas a normalized

31

basis for ({a}  rn/21,{a}  rn/22) does not exist (as we see comparing eqs.
(76), (74) and (75)), an unormalized one exists. we detail the algebraic structure
below. however, the structure in the r.h.s. of eq. (43) does not simplify as for ({a} 
rn/21,{a}  irn/22).
if ({a},{a}) satisfy eqs. (86), the non-local currents j(k) are conserved for all k.
we obtain :

j (a) = exp(cid:16)  iaa + aa(cid:17)
j (n/21) = exp(cid:16)  in/21n/21

it is sucient to perform the inverse of transformation (21) in (56) and (57) to obtain the

for the above solutions is given by :

t (n/21) =
