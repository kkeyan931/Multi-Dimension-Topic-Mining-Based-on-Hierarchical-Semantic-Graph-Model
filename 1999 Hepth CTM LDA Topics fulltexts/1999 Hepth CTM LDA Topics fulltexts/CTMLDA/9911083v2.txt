abstract

we consider models of scalar elds coupled to gravity which are
higher-dimensional generalizations of four dimensional supergravity.
we use these models to describe domain wall junctions in an anti-
de sitter background. we derive bogomolnyi equations for the scalar
elds from which the walls are constructed and for the metric. from
these equations a bps-like formula for the junction energy can be
derived. we demonstrate that such junctions localize gravity in the
presence of more than one uncompactied extra dimension.

1 introduction

one of the very few robust predictions of string theory is the existence of
extra dimensions of spacetime. the apparent conict between this predic-
tion and experiment is traditionally resolved by postulating a direct product
structure in which the additional spatial dimensions describe a compact space
of planckian scale. while this view leads to a potentially rich phenomenol-
ogy, the diculty in choosing amongst compactication scenarios and under-
standing their cosmological evolution encourages the search for alternative
pictures.

it has recently become widely recognized that extra dimensions can be
much larger than the planck scale if the non-gravitational elds of the stan-
dard model are conned to a (3+1)-dimensional brane [1] (see [2] for precur-
sors). taking this idea to its extreme, randall and sundrum [3] have shown
that gravity can be eectively localized to a at four-dimensional submanifold
with a single innite extra dimension if the ve-dimensional bulk geometry
is locally anti-de sitter (ads); see also [4, 5]. it is more dicult, however, to
make this idea work for more than one extra dimension. arkani-hamed et al.
[6] have suggested that this obstacle can be overcome by considering n indi-
vidual branes, each of worldvolume dimension 2 + n, in a (4 + n)-dimensional
spacetime. if these branes intersect at a four-dimensional subspace, with the
solution in the bulk consisting of 2n patches of (4+n)-dimensional anti-de sit-
ter space, gravity can be localized to the four-dimensional intersection. this
scenario has been further elaborated on in [7, 8], where the importance of
determining the tension associated with the junction itself was emphasized.
in a brane-world picture, the branes themselves may be either fundamen-
tal objects or solitons (domain walls) constructed from fundamental elds.
supersymmetric domain walls have been extensively studied (see e.g. [9]); in
supersymmetric theories with multiple discrete vacua, there are typically
bps domain wall solutions which preserve half of the underlying super-
charges.
in (3+1) dimensions, domain wall junctions have been studied
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and it has been shown that there can be a nonzero
tension associated with the junction.
in [13, 14], it was argued that wall
junctions can be bps states, preserving a single hermitian supercharge (of
the four in an n = 1 theory).

1

we are therefore interested in studying (3+1)-dimensional junctions of do-
main walls in higher dimensional supersymmetric theories, coupled to grav-
ity. some general properties of supergravity domain walls are well estab-
lished [15]. the simplest context in which (3+1)-dimensional junctions with
n = 1 susy in 4d can arise is in six-dimensional theories such as gauged
six-dimensional supergravity with sixteen supercharges, coupled to matter
multiplets. unfortunately this set of theories has not yet been constructed.
however, it has recently been pointed out that a general class of theories
of scalar elds coupled to gravity, with potentials v (i) derived from a su-
perpotential, give rise to classical bogomolnyi bounds for the tensions of
domain walls, independently of whether or not they can be derived from a
specic supergravity lagrangian [16, 17]. we therefore consider models in
this class and derive a similar bound for the tension of domain wall junc-
tions, bypassing the construction of the supergravity lagrangians in which
they may or may not be embedded. while bps domain walls in supergrav-
ity are generally singular, in this paper we calculate the contribution to the
energy of the nonsingular region, leaving aside the question of resolving the
singularities.

2 setup

in this section we describe how to adapt the construction of skenderis and
townsend [16] and dewolfe, freedman, gubser and karch [17], describing
domain walls in supergravity-like theories, to a context appropriate for wall
junctions.

we consider a set of complex scalar elds {i} coupled to gravity in d

spacetime dimensions, with an action (in units where 2

s =z ddx (cid:18)1

2q|g|r + lmatter(cid:19) ,

d  8gd = 1)

(1)

(2)

where the matter lagrange density is

lmatter =q|g|(cid:20)

1
2

kijgab(ai)(b

j)  v (, )(cid:21) .

we have assumed that the number of real scalars is even, allowing us to group
them into complex elds, and that the metric on eld space has the kahler
form kij = 2k/i j, with k(, ) the kahler potential. we will assume

2

further that the potential v (, ) can be written in terms of a holomorphic
function w () as

v =(cid:18)d  2

4 (cid:19) exp (k)h(d  2)k ijw;i w;j  2(d  1)w wi ,

where

w;i 

w
i +

k
i w .

(3)

(4)

for obvious reasons we will refer to w as the superpotential, even though
our higher-dimensional examples will not be based on a well-dened super-
gravity theory. for the case of trivial kahler metric, the form (3) was shown
to be necessary for vacuum stability about an ads background [18].

since our ultimate objective is to construct domain wall junctions rather
than the individual walls, we consider an ansatz for the elds which allows
for dependence on two spatial dimensions, xd2 and xd1, which we combine
into complex coordinates:

z  xd2 + ixd1 ,
z  xd2  ixd1 .

our metric ansatz in these coordinates is

ds2 = e2a(z,z)dxdx +

1
2

e2b(z,z) (dzdz + dzdz) ,

(5)

(6)

where  = 0, 1, 2,   , d  3. we assume in addition that the scalar elds
depend only on the extra dimensions, i = 0. this ansatz is the most
general compatible with (d  2)-dimensional poincare invariance.

skenderis and townsend [16] consider a theory with a single scalar eld.
they study a domain-wall ansatz in which the eld only depends on one
spatial coordinate r, and derive bps equations of the form bi = 0 (with bi
rst-order in derivatives of the elds) by showing that the energy functional
can be written in the form

e =z 



dr h(b1)2  (b2)2i + surface terms .

(7)

such a functional will have a saddle point (although not necessarily a mini-
mum, due to the minus sign) at congurations with bi = 0, which one can
verify also solve the full equations of motion of the theory. dewolfe et al.
[17], meanwhile, use an equivalent set of equations similar to those derived

3

from a ve-dimensional supergravity theory in [19]. in supergravity, one can
derive bps equations by setting to zero the supersymmetry transformations
generated by certain spinors , representing the fact that bps states leave
some supersymmetry unbroken [20]. dewolfe et al. point out that, in the
context of scalar elds coupled to gravity, solutions to such equations con-
tinue to solve the full equations of motion whether or not the superpotential
derives from supergravity.

the additional complication introduced by our extra degrees of freedom
and extra spatial dimension renders the procedure of searching for bps equa-
tions by writing the energy functional in a form analogous to (7) prohibitively
unwieldy. instead, we would like to employ supergravity transformations to
obtain the bps equations. however, an appropriate six-dimensional super-
gravity theory from which we could derive bps-like equations has not been
constructed. what we can do is to rst derive the equations appropriate to
ordinary d = 4 supergravity by setting supersymmetry variations to zero,
then generalize those equations to higher dimensions. our strategy for de-
riving bps equations is thus as follows:

 posit the ansatz for the metric and scalar elds appropriate to wall

junctions.

 derive rst-order bps equations in d = 4 supergravity by setting to
 and

zero the supersymmetry transformations of the matter fermions i
the gravitino a, for some spinor parameter .

 generalize these equations to higher dimensions by introducing con-
stant coecients, and determining their values by the requirement that
solutions to the bps equations also solve the equations of motion of a
theory of scalars coupled to gravity (which may or may not be derivable
from supergravity).

once the bps equations are found, they may be used to calculate the ten-
sion of a junction satisfying them (even in the absence of specic solutions).
following [21], it is very plausible that any such solutions are singular in the
cores of the walls. however, we expect that the appearance of such a singu-
larity may under favorable conditions be resolved in a more complete theory
(see for example [22],[23],[24]), and that our results about the existence of
bps congurations and the junction tension should still hold.

4

3 bps equations for junctions

we begin with a derivation of the bps equations in d = 4 supergravity for
our ansatz (6).

for calculational convenience we represent the gravitino a and the mat-
ter fermions i
 as weyl spinors, and the supersymmetry transformation pa-
rameter  as a majorana spinor. the supersymmetry transformations for
the matter fermions are then

i

 = (p+a)ai  exp(cid:18)k

2(cid:19) k ij w;jp+ ,

and for the gravitino

a = p+( a) +

(p+a)exp(cid:18)k

2(cid:19) w ,

where

a is the spacetime covariant derivative acting on spinors, and we have in-
troduced the projection matrices p = (1/2)(1  ). here  = i0123
is the four-dimensional chirality matrix, and aa is an auxiliary axial-vector
gauge eld dened by

in presenting the supersymmetry transformations (8) and (9) we have
not chosen a kahler gauge, thereby preserving covariance under a kahler
transformation in which we assign the matter fermions, the gravitino, and
the local susy parameter a nontrivial transformation law:

aa  im(cid:16)k,iai(cid:17) .

we have chosen the auxiliary axial gauge eld (11) in such a way that under
this transformation the covariant derivative of the susy parameter trans-
forms in a linear way:

aa  aa + a {im[f ()]}
a  exp(cid:18)
a  exp(cid:18)

im[f ()](cid:19)  ( a)

im[f ()](cid:19)

(13)

maintaining this invariance explicitly is useful in deriving the higher-dimensional
analogues of the d = 4 bps equations.

we now look for a set of equations corresponding to a 1/4-bps congu-
ration, i.e., one which is invariant under a single spinor . these equations
will describe the junction states that we seek.

the rst bps equation comes from setting the supersymmetric variation

of the matter fermions to zero, i

 = 0. this condition is

(p+a)ai  exp(cid:18)k
aa and a  ea

2(cid:19) k ij w;jp+ = 0 ,

(14)

where a  ea
a a, with a, b, ... being tangent space indices,
and we have chosen vielbeins ea
3 =
exp (b). for simplicity we will choose the spinor  so that the particular
linear combination of the resulting conditions that we obtain is an equation
for  (and  ). this implies that

3 = 1  2 .

with these conventions, and the assumption that the solution respects 2-

written as

therefore, adding (19) to (20) and equating to zero, the relevant bps equa-
tion becomes

t1 =

(25)

therefore, adding (24) to (25) and setting the sum to zero, we obtain that
the susy variation of  vanishes if and only if

in components, this equation reads

2 (cid:19) w p = 0 .

which yields the second bps equation:

in a similar manner, using the combined variations of z and z, we

where j is some real function, and a third bps equation. writing

(33)

to generalize these bps equations to higher dimensions, we make the
ansatz that they retain the same form up to potential dimension-dependent
constants, while implying the full equations of motion in a higher-dimensional
theory of scalars coupled to gravity.

the independent components of the ricci tensor for our metric are

r = 4exp (2(a  b))h a + (d  2)(a)( a)i ,
rzz = (d  2)h2(a)(b)  (a)2  2ai ,
rz z = (d  2)h a + (a)( a)i  2 b .

(34)

(the z z component of rab, like that of the energy-momentum tensor be-
low, is obtained from the zz component by replacing   .) the energy-
momentum tensor is

t = 2exp (2(a  b)) k,ijh(i)(  j) + ( i)( j)i 

exp (2a) v (, ) ,

tzz = 2kij(i)( j) ,

tz z = 

1
2

exp (2b) v (, ) .

(35)

there are thus three independent einstein equations; the  equation gives

2(d  3) a + 2 b + (d  2)(d  3)(a)( a) =
k,ijh(i)(  j) + ( i)( j)i 
exp (2b) v (, ) ,

1
2

the zz equation gives

(d  2)h2(a)(b)  (a)2  2ai = 2kij(i)( j) ,

and the zz equation gives

(36)

(37)

(d  2)h a + (d  2)(a)( a)i = 

1
2

exp (2b) v (, ) .

(38)

9

in addition we have the scalar eld equation of motion,

(d  2)h2(a)( i) + 2( a)(i)i + 4 i +

+4k i mk,jk m(j)( k) = exp (2b) k ijv,j .

(39)

substitution of the four-dimensional bps equations, augmented by appropri-
ate constant coecients, back into these d-dimensional equations of motion
yields the following d-dimensional bps equations:

i =

(d  2)

exp (dn ) k ij w;j ,

a =

n =

(40)

(41)

(42)

where we have restored explicit factors of d for later convenience. together,
these equations imply the equations of motion for gravity in d dimensions
coupled to a set of complex scalars with kahler potential k and potential
energy given by (3).

4 bps bounds and the junction energy

in this section we compute the energy of congurations described by the bps
equations that we have derived. we are interested in static congurations,
for which the energy density is dened as the negative of the action:

e =z dxd1dxd2 (igrav + imatter) ,

igrav  

1

= 2 exp ((d  2)a)h2 (b + (d  2)a)

2q|g|r
+ (d  1)(d  2)(a)( a)i ,

where

and

imatter  exp ((d  2)a)n2kij(i)(  j) + 2kij( j)( i)

(d  2)

+

4

exp (2b + k)h(d  2)k ijw;i w;j
2(d  1)w wio .

10

(43)

(44)

(45)

the gravitational piece of this can be rewritten in the form

igrav = (d  2) exp ((d  2)a)n(a)( k) + ( a)(k)  2( a)(n)

 2 (a)( n )  2(d  3)(a)( a)o

+ 1 ,

where 1 is a total derivative given by

1  hexp ((d  2)a) (2(d  2) a + 2 n  k)i

+  [exp ((d  2)a) (2(d  2)a + 2n   k)] .
similarly, the matter piece of the energy density can be rewritten as

(46)

(47)

imatter = exp ((d  2)a)n4kij(i)(  j)

+(d  2)(a)h2k,j(  j)  ( k)i + (d  2)( a)h2k,i(i)  (k)i
(d  2)

exp (2b + k)h(d  2)k ijw;i w;j  2(d  1)w wi)

+

4

+2 ,

(48)

where 2 is a total derivative term given by

2  hexp ((d  2)a) (k,i i  k,j

+ hexp ((d  2)a) (k,j j  k,ii)i .

 j)i

(49)

adding (46) to (48), the resulting integrand is

igrav + imatter = exp ((d  2)a)h4kij(b1)i(b1)j + 2(d  2)k,i(b1)i(b2)

+ 2(d  2)k,j(b2)(b1)j  2(d  2)(b3)(b2)
 2(d  2)(b2)(b3)  2(d  2)(d  3)(b2)(b2)]
+ 1 + 2 + 3 ,

(50)

where each of the terms (b1)i, (b2), (b3) vanishes independently by virtue
of bps equations (40), (41), (42) respectively, and the third total derivative
is

3  (d  2) [exp (n + (d  2)a) w ]

+(d  2) hexp (n  + (d  2)a) wi .

(51)

11

we therefore nd that the total energy as dened by (43), can be ex-

pressed for a bps junction state as

etotal =z ddx (1 + 2 + 3) .

(52)

to interpret this expression, it is useful to consider the at-space limit of
bps junctions, considered (in four dimensions) in [13, 14]. setting d = 0
in (40) yields

i =

(d  2)

4

k ij w,j ,

(53)

which is precisely the at-space bps equation for wall junctions. meanwhile,
in this limit (41) simply becomes a = 0, so a is a constant that can be
set to zero by a trivial coordinate transformation. further, (36) implies that
in the d = 0 limit b is a harmonic real function of z and z, and therefore
can be brought to zero by a holomorphic coordinate transformation of z
and z. thus, we recover at spacetime in this limit. however, we also nd
important information from the o(1
d) term in the small-d limit; since the
o(0
d) term in a can be set to zero, we can dene a  a/d, which in
this limit satises

a =

w ,

(54)

1
2

which is precisely the equation satised by the preprole for the superpoten-
tial for bps junctions discussed in [14]. thus, in this limit, the 1 term in
(52) vanishes, while 3 becomes the sum of the energy of the individual walls
and 2 becomes the tension associated with the junction itself. as shown in
[25], the junction tension is negative.

5 a graviton zero mode

arkani-hamed et al. [6] have shown that the eective (d  2)-dimensional
theory on a junction of innitely thin walls should contain a localized gravi-
ton.
in this section we check that our solitonic walls (of nite thickness)
also contain a distinguished zero mode metric uctuation which, for a well-
behaved junction solution, will be localized to the hub. we nd that there
exists a closed form expression for this mode, and note that its existence
appears to be a general feature of domain wall junctions in ads, rather than
a special feature that occurs as a result of supersymmetry. we will also ex-
amine the graviton zero mode for a single domain wall, and make an explicit

12

connection with the wave equation of [3] and its zero-eigenvalue solution in
the long-distance limit.

we begin with a set of background elds i(z, z) and background metric
gab satisfying the bogolmonyi equations (40)-(42), and consider linearized
equations for the metric perturbations by substituting gab  gab + gab into
the equations of motion (36)-(39). we nd that there is a self-consistent
solution without introducing perturbations in the scalar elds. we take the
metric uctuation gab to be of the form

gzz = gzz = gz z = gz = 0 ,

(55)

g = eipxe2a(z, z)p ,

(56)
where (z, z) is the graviton wavefunction. here p  x  px, with p some
(d  2) vector, and p = p is a polarization tensor satisfying
(p) = (p) = pp = p = pp = 0 .

(57)

it is convenient to write the perturbed einstein equation as

rab  (cid:20)1

2

rgab + tab(cid:21) = 0 .

(58)

straightforward computation then shows that the rst term, the variation of
the ricci tensor, is

r =  eipxe2a2bn(d  2)(a)( ) + (d  2)( a)()
+2  + 4h a + (d  2)(a)( a)i o p ,

with all other components vanishing. the second term in (58) is

1
2

(rg) + t = eipxe2a(cid:18) 2v

d  2(cid:19) p .

(59)

(60)

therefore, the linearized equations of motion are equivalent to the schrodinger
equation

h2   (d  2)(a)   (d  2)( a)i 

(cid:20)4 a + 4(d  2)(a)( a) +

2v

d  2(cid:21)  = 0 .

(61)

13

however, using equations (40)-(42) and the denition (3) of the scalar po-
tential, we see that the second term vanishes, and the distinguished solution
to the massless schrodinger equation is simply  = constant, or

g  eipxe2ap .

lacking an explicit solution to the bps equations, we can nevertheless
check that our graviton uctuation reduces to that of [6] in the long-distance
(thin-wall) limit. this serves to verify that the integral of the square norm
of the wavefunction is indeed convergent far from the walls. for the case of
a four-wall junction in two extra dimensions, the metric of [6] can be written

1

ds2 =

(k|y1| + k|y2| + 1)2 (dxdx + dy2

1 + dy2

2) ,

(63)

where we are using yi instead of zi to avoid confusion with our complex

coordinates, and k  (2l)1, with l the ads curvature radius in the bulk.

this is a special case of our metric (6), with

ea = eb = (k|y1| + k|y2| + 1)1 .

the associated graviton zero-mode is

g  eipx(k|y1| + k|y2| + 1)2p ,

(64)

(65)

which therefore agrees with the form given by (62). thus, integrating the
norm square of the wavefunction  over the z-z plane, we nd that the
norm is nite in this thin-wall limit. more precisely, since the metric may
be singular near the walls, we have shown that there is a distinguished zero-
frequency wavefunction whose lack of normalizability can only arise as a
result of the singular behavior of the solution when curvatures become large
and the supergravity approximation breaks down. however, since we know
that under favorable conditions the wall solutions themselves can become
nonsingular when embedded in higher-dimensional supergravity, we believe
that the normalizable zero mode is likely to be a robust feature of the full
supergravity (or string theory) state.

6 discussion

the idea that the three observed dimensions of our universe may not be the
only large spatial dimensions, and that our universe may exist as a distin-
guished 3-manifold embedded in a higher dimensional space, is an intriguing
alternative to conventional compactication [3]. if the true universe is (4 + 1)
dimensional, then the relevant 3-manifold is a domain wall, or 3-brane. how-
ever, for larger background spaces, the 3-manifold representing our universe
may lie at an intersection of a number of such codimension one branes [6].
(for alternative proposals supporting more than one extra dimension, see
[26], [27].) in this paper we have considered models of scalar elds coupled
to gravity, which are higher dimensional generalizations of four dimensional
supergravity. we were able to derive rst-order bps equations appropriate
to junction congurations with (3 + 1)-dimensional poincare invariance on
the hub.

the question of the cosmological constant as measured by inhabitants
of the brane world is a crucial one in randall-sundrum scenarios and their
generalizations.
in models where the branes are put in by hand as delta-
function sources, the induced cosmological constant can be tuned to zero
by appropriately balancing the brane tension against the bulk cosmological
constant (either in the original single-brane scenario [3] or in junction models
[6]). in models where the branes are solitons constructed in a eld theory,
there may be additional constraints on the induced brane geometry. in the
single-brane case, behrndt and cvetic have argued that a bps state in an
actual supergravity theory will automatically have a at induced geometry
[21], although it may also necessarily be singular. the examples of skenderis
and townsend [16] and dewolfe et al. [17] demonstrate that it is possible to
nd non-singular bps-like solutions with at induced geometries, although
not necessarily in theories that are truncations of supergravity.

in the case of junctions, there is an additional complication due to the
tension of the junction itself; one might worry that there could not simultane-
ously be at walls, a at junction, and a nonvanishing junction tension. we
proceeded with an ansatz satisfying (3 + 1)-dimensional poincare invariance,
implying a at geometry on the junction itself, and were able to derive a
consistent set of bps-like equations in a theory of scalars coupled to gravity.
since our solutions feature a nonzero junction tension, the external geome-
try in the thin-wall limit will therefore resemble the ads patches of [6] along

15

with extra global identications representing a decit angle due to the grav-
itational inuence of the junction, as discussed in [8]. our ability to derive
the appropriate bps equations is good evidence that such solutions exist
(although they may be singular); it would be interesting to further explore
the relationship between the tensions on the walls and the junction, the bulk
cosmological constant, and the induced geometry. it is unclear, for exam-
ple, whether preserving supersymmetry necessarily induces a at metric on
a junction.

in an innitely thin brane junction universe, it has been argued that
the graviton is conned to the junction [6]. here we have examined this
question for junctions of nite width, constructed as solitonic solutions to
eld theories. in this microphysical context we have shown that the junction
state admits a graviton zero mode, normalizable away from the walls, and
thus localizes gravity eectively.
in addition, this result does not appear
to depend crucially on supersymmetry. rather it appears to be a general
feature of domain wall junctions in an anti-de sitter background.

the models considered in this paper are particle-physics realizations of a
generalized randall-sundrum scenario, and as such should provide a testing
ground for details of the theory. we have demonstrated how various aspects
of the brane-world idea arise in the context of these models, and hope that
further investigation will cast light on the implications of this scenario for
the observable universe.
