(67) (68) sequel shall derive combinatoric equation determines f completely. together functional equations discussed above, basic ingredient proving equivalence hamiltonian equations motion lax equations, well validity poisson bracket relations. 12 elliptic calogero model, calculation goes follows. first, use eqns (64) (65) compute following expression dierence two sides lax equation (57): l(u)  = p + x + x, 2 x 2 x,, (cid:16)((q), u) ((q), u) ((q), u) ((q), u)(cid:17)h g g(cid:16)((q), u) ((q), u) ((q), u) ((q), u)(cid:17) n, e . g ((q), u) ( q) e x g g ((q)) ((q), u) (f) e g ((q), u) (p) e + 1 + 1 += g 2 here, double sum commutators  appearing commutator l(u) a(u) has, antisymmetrization coecients , split two contributions, one corresponding terms + = 0 terms + 6= 0, nonzero + . inserting functional equations (51), (52) rearranging terms, get 2 ((q)) h + x g g ((q)) ((q), u) (f) e g ((q), u) ( q p) e g = p + 1 l(u)  2 x + x, 2 x, 2 x, 1 + 1 g g ((q)) ((q), u) n, e g g ((q)) ((q), u) n, e . renaming summation indices last two sums ( rst, second) using eqns (12), (13), (35) (41), nally obtain l(u)  2 x 2 x, ((q)) h + x ((q)) g(cid:0)2 g (f) g+ n, g n,(cid:1) ((q), u) e . g ((q), u) ( q p) e = p + 1 vanishing sum rst two terms third term precisely equations motion, last double sum must vanish. thus led conclude + 1 g 2 13 that, elliptic calogero model, lax equations (57) equivalent hamiltonian equations motion (40) roots , x ((q)) g(cid:0)2 g (f) , ,(cid:1) = 0 . (69) calculation (s, u) replaced w(s) (s) replaced w(s)/2w(s) leads conclusion that, ordinary (rational trigonometric) calogero models, lax equations (56) equivalent hamiltonian equations motion (39) roots , w((q)) 2 w((q)) x g(cid:0)2 g (f) , ,(cid:1) = 0 . (70) since relations must hold identically q, led postulate validity following combinatoric identity: 2 g (f) = , + , , . (71) passing poisson bracket relation (60) elliptic case, use eqn (64) compute lhs, starting canonical poisson brackets {pj, qk} = jk , give {pj, ((q), u)} = ((q), u) (hj) , hence, due identities (14) (38), {p, ((q), u)} = ((q), u) h . leads following momentum independent expression lhs eqn (60): {l1(u), l2(v)} = x g(cid:16)((q), v) h e ((q), u) e h(cid:17) . (72) compute rhs eqn (60) observe rst also momentum independent, since possibly momentum dependent terms cancel:   (p)(cid:16)((q), u v) e e ((q), v u) e e(cid:17) = x = 0 . 14 remaining terms are, according eqn (14),   g ((u v) + (v)) ((q), u) e h g ((v u) + (u)) ((q), v) h e ((q), u) ((q), v)(cid:16)i g (f) g (f)(cid:17) e e g ((q), u v) ((q), u) h e = x + x + x, + x x x,, + x,, += += g ((q), v u) ((q), v) e h g ((q), u v) ((q), u) n, e e g ((q), v u) ((q), v) n, e e . last four terms obtained splitting two terms con- taining tensor products root generator commutator two root generators, say  e e , two contributions: one corre- sponding terms + = 0 one corresponding terms + ; moreover, renaming summation indices performed. using eqns (12) (13) rearranging terms, get   = + x x + x, + x,, g(cid:16)((v u) + (u)) ((q), v) + ((q), u v) ((q), u)(cid:17) h e g(cid:16)((u v) + (v)) ((q), u) + ((q), v u) ((q), v)(cid:17) e h ((q), u) ((q), v)(cid:16)i g (f) g (f)(cid:17) e e g(cid:16)((q), u v) ((q), u) += + ((q), v u) ((q), v)(cid:17) n, e e . inserting functional equations (53) (54), nally left 15   = x + x, g(cid:16)((q), v) h e ((q), u) e h(cid:17) ((q), u) ((q), v)(cid:16)i g (f) g (f) g+ n,(cid:17) e e . rst term gives precisely rhs eqn (72), last double sum must vanish. thus led conclude that, elliptic calogero model, poisson bracket relation (60) hold following combinatoric identity valid: g (f) g (f) = , , . (73) calculation (s, u) (s, v) replaced w(s), (s, u v) (s, vu) replaced w(s)/w(s) replaced zero leads conclusion that, ordinary (rational trigonometric) calogero model, poisson bracket relation (59) hold combinatoric identity (73) valid. more- over, identity easily shown equivalent previously imposed identity (71). two basic results thus obtained entirely independent hamil- tonian quadratic function l-matrix whereas a-matrix essentially composition r-matrix l-matrix. precisely, using invari- ant bilinear form (. , .) g identify g dual space g reinterpret r linear mapping g g rather tensor g g,2 form composition r l r(u, v) l(u), respectively; and, due eqn (44), h = 1 2 (l, l) = r l ordinary (rational trigonometric) calogero model h = res|u=0(cid:18) 1 2u (l(u), l(u))(cid:19) and, due eqns (50) (54), (74) (75) (76) gf r(u, v) l(v) = a(u) ((u v) + (v)) l(u) + (v) x 2more precisely, convention used apply identication g g second factor tensor product g g. 16 a(u) = res|v=u(cid:18) 1 v u r(u, v) l(v)(cid:19) + (u) l(u) (77) hence elliptic calogero model, provided function f mentioned satises simple constraint equation gf = 0 . x (78) therefore, using general fact poisson bracket relations (59) (60) imply lax equations (56) (57) one simply substitutes r l r(u, v) l(u) a(u), respectively, shows choices lax equations follow poisson bracket relations. (for convenience reader, proof general fact reproduced appendix 2.) concluding, mention fact view invariance structure constants n, action weyl group, nw,w = n, w w (g) , (79) together coupling constants g, required eqn (36), function f must covariant (equivariant) action weyl group: fw = w(f) w w (g) . (80) 3.2 solution combinatoric identity clear whether eventually choice coupling constants g, exists (vector valued) function f eqn (67), satisfying required combinatoric identity (71). following, want answer question full generality, semisimple lie algebras. begin with, observe problem semisimple lie algebras easily reduced simple lie algebras. fact, semisimple lie algebra decomposed direct sum simple ideals, root system decomposed orthogonally irreducible root systems, since sum two roots belonging dierent subsystems root, combinatoric identity (71) split separate identities, one simple ideals, independent choice coupling constants them. analyze problem simple lie algebras, remark rst that, due fact roots simple lie algebra length constitute single weyl group orbit, choice coupling constants severely restricted: 17 g simply laced ar (r 1), dr (r 4), e6, e7, e8: roots length, single coupling constant g, nonzero. result, coupling constants drop eqn (71), reduces 2 (f) = n, + n, . (81) g simply laced br (r 2), cr (r 3), f4, g2: root system splits precisely two weyl group orbits, precisely two coupling constants, gl long roots gs short roots, least one nonzero. fact, somewhat precise, requiring simple lie algebras so(2r + 1, c) b-series, gl nonzero simple lie algebras sp(2r, c) c-series, gs nonzero; r = 2, nonzero. otherwise, hamiltonian corresponding calogero model (as given eqns (33) (34)) would decouple, is, would decompose sum r copies hamiltonian system one degree freedom, system trivially completely integrable. note also function f , exists, must unique, since otherwise coupling constants would vanish. (the argument relies fact even roots dierent length, space h r already generated long roots short roots alone.) trivial case simplest simple lie algebras, namely unique one rank 1, sl(2, c). here, may simply set f 0 single positive root, rhs combinatoric identity (71) vanishes identically. generally, particular role played simple lie algebras sl(n, c) a-series. handle case, rst x notation. correctly normalized invariant bilinear form sl(n, c) trace form dening representation, fact extended non-degenerate invariant bilinear form gl(n, c): (x, ) = trace (xy ) x, gl(n, c) .
