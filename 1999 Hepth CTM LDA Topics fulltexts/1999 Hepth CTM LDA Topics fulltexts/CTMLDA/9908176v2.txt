abstract

we investigate a class of models in 1+1 dimensions with four
fermion interaction term. at each order of the perturbation expansion,
the models are ultraviolet nite and lorentz non-invariant. we show
that for certain privileged values of the coupling constants, lorentz
symmetry is restored, and indeed the model turns out to be confor-
mally invariant. this phenomenon is both quantum mechanical and
non-perturbative.

1. introduction

conformal models have played an important role both in the statistical
mechanics of lower dimensional systems and in the construction of viable
string theories. in the absence of a systematic approach so far for the clas-
sication and the construction of conformal theories, various special models
have been proposed and applied to string theory [1,2]. among these are the
conformal models based on the ane virasoro construction [3,4], which are
generalizations of the original sugawara model in terms of currents that sat-
isfy an ane algebra. apart from some isolated cases [5], this construction
has so far not found widespread application in string theory. among the
reasons for this is the lack of a good understanding of the local eld theory
that is at the basis of this construction. several formulations of the model
based on various generalized sigma model type actions have been proposed
[6,7,8], but more work is needed to make progress along this direction.

a dierent approach to the same problem is to start with various gen-
eralizations of the thirring model and investigate possible non-trivial xed
points in the coupling constant space. this approach is motivated by the ob-
servation that the interaction in these models is of the form currentcurrent,
which is very suggestive of the ane virasoro construction. the original
thirring model has already been used in string compactication [9]. in their
classical work, dashen and frishman [10] showed that a non-abelian gener-
alization of the thirring model symmetric under a lie group is conformally
invariant for certain quantized values of the coupling constant, and at these
conformal points, the stress tensor admits an ane- sugawara construction.
more recent work [11,12,13] suggests the possible existence of more general
non-symmetric xed points in the coupling constant space.

in this paper, we shall investigate a dierent generalization of the thirring
model. the models in question have some unusual properties. since the cou-
pling constants are dimensionless, one would expect the appearence of the
usual renormalizable divergences in perturbation theory.
instead, it turns
out that each order of perturbation expansion is ultraviolet nite. another
surprising feature is connected with lorentz invariance. supercially, the
interaction term in these models seems to violate lorentz invariance on the
world sheet, and if true, this would disqualify them from being of use in
string theory.3 we will however show that, if the coupling constants in the

3it was also suggested in reference [4] that ane virasoro constructions are surrounded

by non-lorentz invariant theories.

interaction term satisfy the virasoro master equation or simply the master
equation [4], the corresponding model is conformally invariant, and the stress
tensor is given by the ane virasoro construction. it then follows trivially
that, since the conformal group includes lorentz transformations, contrary
to the appearances, the model is also lorentz invariant. we would like to
emphasize that lorentz invariance is realized non-perturbatively only at the
points in the coupling constant space that satisfy the master equation; indi-
vidual terms in the perturbation expansion violate this symmetry. it is also
of some interest to determine the transformation properties of the various
elds that appear in the model under the lorentz group, since in general
elds could transform non-lineary in a complicated fashion. we have in-
vestigated the transformation properties of the basic fermion elds and the
currents, which are bilinear composites of the fermions. it turns out that the
fermions transform linearly, with, however an anomalous coecient for the
spin term. the currents also transform linearly, with a dierent coecient
for the spin term. again, these simple transformation properties hold only
at the conformal points in the space of coupling constants.

a question of some interest is whether it is possible to nd a model based
on bosonic elds with the properties discussed above; namely, lack of classi-
cal lorentz symmetry and its quantum mechanical restoration. one can in
fact construct such a model directly by bosonizing the fermionic eld theory
we are going to introduce in the next section. the methods of bosoniza-
tion are well known, and they have already been applied to similar thirring
type models [11,12].
it is then quite easy to adopt them to the problem
at hand. however, the resulting theory has a complicated structure, and it
seems quite dicult to analyze quantum mechanical lorentz invariance in
this formulation. this is the main reason why we have based our exposition
on the fermionic version of the theory.
the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we will introduce the
model and argue for the lack of ultraviolet divergences in perturbation theory.
in section 3, we will review free elds and the ane virasoro construction.
in section 4, we will show that if the coupling constants satisfy the master
equation, the model is conformally invariant. the demonstration is based on
the calculation of the operator form of the stress tensor in the standard in-
teraction representation. in section 4, the lorentz transformation properties
of the fermions and the currents will be determined. finally, the last section
will summarize our conclusions.

2. the model

the model is based on the following action:

where,

and,

i = i0 + i ,

i0 =

i

2 z d2 aa,

(1)

(2)

(3)

i  = z d2 (cid:16)g cij j i

+j j

+ + g c

ij j i

j j

(cid:17) .

in these equations, as are two component majorana spinors in 1+1 dimen-
sions. as is usual in string theory, the time coordinate is denoted by  and
the space coordinate by . again in keeping with the string usage, we will
take  to be compact and to range from 0 to 2, although this is not im-
portant for most of the subsequent development. the coupling constants cij
and c
ij that appear in the interaction are real and symmetric in i and j. we
have also introduced two redundant constant g and g for later convenience.
 of denite chirality are constructed from chiral fermions a
the currents j i
:

j i
 =

1
4

a

 i

ab b
,

(4)

where i are matrices which act on the internal space labeled by a and b.
they satisfy the commutation relations

[i, j] = if ijkk,

and generate some lie algebra. in what follows, we will take this algebra
to be semi-simple with the metric given by identity, so that there will be no
need to distinguish between upper and lower indices.

we shall now argue that the perturbation expansion for these models is
ultraviolet nite. to start with, it is clear that the + and  chiralities never
mix, and therefore they can be considered seperately in the perturbation
expansion. as a simple example, consider the one loop contribution to the
+ chirality fermion-fermion scattering.
if p is the total external momen-
tum, suppressing all the dependence on the internal space indices and overall

3

constants, one encounters a potentially divergent integral of the form

d2k
(2)2

(k0  k1)(p0  k0  p1 + k1)

k2(p  k)2

m = z
= iz 1

0

(k2 + (2  )p2)2

= 

i
2

(p0  p1)2

p2

.

(5)

the integral, which supercially appeared to be logarithmically divergent, is
actually convergent. this is because the k dependent terms in the numerator
on the second line of the equation, which would normally lead to a divergent
integral, all vanish after the integration over the angle . since the fermions in
the feynman graph all have positive chirality, the propagators always carry a
factor k0 k1, which after euclidean rotation turns into ik ei. the important
point is that factors of k in the numerator always appear in the combination
k ei and, as a result, all of the  dependent terms vanish upon integration.
but since these are the only possible divergent terms, the integral must be
nite. it is easy to see that this argument works also for higher order graphs,
and it follows that all of them are nite. a similar argument, with a change of
the sign of , shows that all of the graphs with negative chirality fermions are
also nite. the only potentially divergent graphs are the ones that contain
both positive and negative chirality fermions, but because of the form of the
interaction (eq.(3)), there are no graphs of this type.

the price paid for the niteness of the model is the loss of lorentz invari-
ance, at least in the perturbation expansion. lorentz invariant interactions
must conserve chirality, which is not the case in our model. one can check
the breakdown of lorentz invariance explicitly in the case fermion-fermion
scattering process discussed above. higher order graphs for this process will
yield an answer proportional to a factor of the form

 (p0  p1)2

p2

!n

where the integer n will depend on the order of perturbation theory. since
the above factor scales under lorentz transformations, dierent orders in
perturbation expansion will have dierent lorentz transformation properties.
this only means, however, that there is no lorentz invariance for arbitrary

4

values of the coupling constants. in section 4, we will show that, for special
values of the coupling constants, lorentz invariance is restored.

3. free field constructions

in this section, we will review the free eld limit of the model, with g set
equal to zero, and introduce the ane virasoro construction as a preparation
for the next section. the free fermions of denite chirality, a
0,, depend on
the coordinates through the combinations  , and they satisfy the following
commutation relations:

[a

0,(z), b

0,(z)] = a,b (z  z).

(6)

in this equation, z stand for    for the + components and for  +  for the
 components. free currents j i
0, are constructed from free fermions as in
eq.(4), with a normal ordering prescription. they satisfy the commutation
relations

[j i

0,(z), j j

0,(z)] = ifijk (z  z) 

i
2

i,j (z  z),

(7)

where z has the same meaning as before. the constant  is the coecient of
the central term, and, given the representation matrices i, it can easily be
calculated.

another quantity of interest is the stress tensor of the free eld theory.
since there is no mass term, the stress tensor is traceless, and and the two
independent components can be conveniently taken to be

in terms of free fermions, they are given by the normal ordered expression

(8)

(9)

1

2 (cid:16)t 0,0

0  t 0,1

0 (cid:17) .

t0, =

i

4 (cid:16): a

t0, = 

0, a

0, :  : a

0, a

0, :(cid:17) .

t0, satisfy the conservation equations

( + )t0,+ = (  )t0, = 0,

and therefore they are functions of only the variables    respectively. we
also note that their commutators generate the virasoro algebra:

[t0,(z), t0,(z)] = i(z  z) (t0,(z) + t0,(z)) +

ic0
2

(3

z + z)(z  z),
(10)

5

where z =    as before. the numerical value of the coecient c0 of the
central term will not be needed.

after this discussion of free elds, we will briey review the ane virasoro
construction and the master equation. the ane virasoro construction is an
ansatz for the stress tensor in terms of free currents:

l+(z) = cij : j i
ij : j i
l(z) = c

0,+(z)j j
0,(z)j j

0,+(z) :,
0,(z) :,

(11)

where the double dots imply normal ordering in order to have a well dened
product of the currents. the basic idea is to require l(z) to satisfy the
virasoro algebra

[l(z), l(z)] = i(z  z) (l(z) + l(z)) +

ic
2

(3

z + z)(z  z), (12)

given that the currents satisfy the commutation relations of eq.(7). it can be
shown that [4] this leads to the following equation (the master equation) for
the constants cij:

cij = 2cikckj  fklifkljckkcll  fkklflljcikckl  flklfklicklckj,

(13)

with a similar equation for c
ij. a large number of solutions to eq.(13) with
real and symmetric cs are known [4]. any one of them would be satisfactory
for our purposes.

another commutation relation that will be needed in the future is

[t0,(z), l(z)] = i(z  z)l

(z)  2i(z  z)l(z),

(14)

which follows from free eld commutation relation after the use of eqs.(8)
and (11).

the use of the same symbols cij and c

ij in both the above equation and
in eq.(3) was not accidental; from now on we will x the cs as well as the
cs that appear in the interaction term in eq.(3) to be a real and symmetric
solution to their respective master equations. for the time being, g and g
are arbitrary; later, they will also be xed.

4. the interaction

after having xed the constants in the interaction term, we are going to
study the model in the interaction representation. our goal is to establish

6

the conformal invariance of the model. since the model is translation in-
variant, one can easily construct the translation operators p 0 and p 1 by the
usual noether procedure. however, since the model is not manifestly lorentz
invariant, this stress tensor is not symmetrical, and the existence of the gen-
erators of the lorentz group, let alone the conformal group, is problematic.
since we can no longer employ to the noether construction, we will instead
show that the stress tensor can be determined uniquely by appealing to the
following principles:
a) the stress tensor should be local function of the coordinates.
b) it should be symmetric and traceless.
c) the components

t =

(t 0,0  t 0,1)

1
2

should satisfy the conservation equations (9).
d) the energy and momentum operators should be given by the standard
expressions

p  =

1
2

(p 0  p 1) = z dt .

(15)

the conditions we have listed above refer to operators in the heisenberg
picture. however, for technical reasons, we have found it convenient to go
through the intermediate step of the interaction representation. the great
advantage of this picture is that all the manipulations involve only free elds.
we remind the reader of a few well known facts about the interaction
representation. in this picture, the eld  is taken to be the free eld 0,
and the states satisfy the schroedinger equation

where the interaction hamiltonian hi is given in terms free currents by

i | i = hi( )| i,

(16)

hi( ) = z d(cid:16)g cij : j i

+ g c

ij : j i

0,( + )j j

0,+(  )j j

0,+(  ) :

0,( + ) : (cid:17)

= z d (g l+(  ) + g l( + ))
= z d (g l+() + g l()) .

(17)

actually, we are interested in the elds expressed in the heisenbeg picture,
but we nd it advantageous to rewrite them in terms free elds of the inter-
action picture. for this purpose, we need the dyson operator u(, 0), which

7

governs the time development of the states in the interaction representation:

| i = u(, 0)| = 0i.

from its denition, this operator satises

i u(, 0) = hi( )u(, 0),

u( = 0, 0) = 1,

(18)

where the heisenberg and the interaction pictures are taken to coincide at
time  = 0. in our case, the above equation is easily integrated since hi( )
given by eq.(17) is  independent:

u(, 0) = exp(i hi ).

(19)

a general eld operator (, ) in the heisenberg picture can be expressed
in terms of the same operator i(, ), in the interaction picture by the
equation

(, ) = u 1(, 0)i(, )u(, 0).

(20)

i is either a free eld, or for a composite operator like the currents or
the stress tensor, it is a product of free elds.
in what follows, we will
specify various operators of interest in the interaction picture in terms of
free elds, and attach to them an index i in order to distinguish them from
the heisenberg operators, which will be free of this index. the latter can
then be constructed explicitly through eqs.(19) and (20).

having gotten these preliminaries out of way, we are ready to specify
the combination of components t 
in the interaction picture. the unique
i
solution that is local and that satises the energy and momentum conditions
of eq.(15) is,

ti,+ = t0,+(   ) 

ti, = t0,( +  ) 

g
2
g
2

l+(   ) 

l+(   ) 

g
2
g
2

l( +  ),

l( +  ).

(21)

as usual, the + components of free elds depend only on the variable   
and the  components on the variable  +  . the remaining components of
ti can then be solved for using the symmetry and the zero trace condition,
and therefore, these conditions are automatically satised.

8

now that we have the stress tensor in the interaction picture, we can
translate it into the heisenberg picture. it is easy to carry out the calculation
explicitly. for example,

i (cid:16)u 1(, 0)l+(z)u(, 0)(cid:17) = u 1(, 0)[l+(z), hi]u(, 0)

= igl

+(z),

(22)

where, in the last step, the expression for hi in terms of l (eq.(17)) and
the commutation relations (12) were used. this equation, and a similar one
for l(z), have the solutions

u 1(, 0)l+(z)u(, 0) = l+(z + g ),
u 1(, 0)l(z)u(, 0) = l(z  g ).

(23)

proceeding in the same fashion, we have,

+(z)u(, 0) = ig l

+(z + g ).

i (cid:16)u 1(, 0)t0,+(z)u(, 0)(cid:17) = ig u 1(, 0)l

this equation, and the corresponding one for t0,, have the solutions

u 1(, 0)t0,+(z)u(, 0) = l+(z + g )  l+(z) + t0,+(z),
u 1(, 0)t0,(z)u(, 0) = l(z  g )  l(z) + t0,(z).

(24)

(25)

putting everything together, we can convert the stress tensor in the interac-
tion picture given by eq.(21) into the heisenberg picture:

t+(, ) = (1 

g
2

)l+(   + g )  l+(   ) 

g
2

l( +   g )

+ t0,+(   ),

t(, ) = (1 

g
2

)l( +   g ) + l( +  ) 

+ t0,( +  ).

g
2

l+(   + g )

(26)

according to the conservation equations, t+ should be a function of only
   and t should be a function of only  +  . this requirement xes the
coupling constants to be the following four combinations:

g = 0, 2 g = 0, 2.

(27)

9

the zero values for the coupling constants correspond to the trivial free eld
solutions. we exhibit below the solution g = g = 2:

t+(, ) = t0,+(   )  l+(   )  l(   ),
t(, ) = t0,( +  )  l( +  )  l+( +  ).

(28)

as a further conrmation of conformal invariance, one can easily show
that t satisfy the virasoro algebra (eq.(12)). it is also easy to check that
the model has poincare invariance. the single lorentz generator is given by
the standard expression

m( ) = z d ((   )t+ + ( +  )t) ,

(29)

and, using the virasoro algebra, the poincare commutation relations

[m, p ] = ip ,

are easily veried. here we have the interesting situation of the restaura-
tion of lorentz symmetry as a result of quantum eects in a model that
violates this symmetry classically. this is a non-perturbative phenomenon
that happens only for certain xed values of the coupling constants.

we have just seen that the stress tensor has a simple exact expression in
terms of free elds, even though the model is interacting. this simplication
only occurs at the conformal points, with cs xed by the master equation
(13) and gs xed by (27). another set of elds that are exactly calculable
in terms of free elds are l (see eq.(23)). however, as far as we know, no
other elds enjoy this property even when the model is conformal.

5. lorentz transformations

it is of some interest to nd the transformation properties of the fermion
elds and the currents under lorentz transformations. in what follows, we
will set g = g = 2 and focus on the + chirality elds; the calculation for the
 chirality elds is entirely analogous. to nd the transformation law of +,
for example, one has to compute its commutator with the lorentz generator
m of eq.(29).
it is easiest to do this calculation at  = 0; at this point,
u = 1, and the heisenberg and the interaction pictures coincide. one can
then carry out the computation in the interaction picture using free elds.

10

the equal time commutator of the fermion eld with the stress tensor has
the form

[0,+(, ), ti,+(, )] = (  )a(, )
+(  ) (b(, ) + b(, )) ,

(30)

where a and b will be calculated below. given this result, the commutators
of + with the poincare generators at  = 0 are easily found to be

[0,+(0, ), p +] = [0,+(0, ),z dti,+(0, )]
[0,+(0, ), m(0)] = [0,+(0, ),z d ti,+(0, )]

= a(0, ) + b(0, ),

=  a(0, ) + b(0, ) +  b(0, ),

(31)

leading to the result

[0,+(0, ), m(0)] =  [0,+(0, ), p +] + b(0, ).

(32)

the rst term on the right comes from the transformation of the coordinates,
since

i
2

(  ) = [, p ].

the second term, b, is then the spin transformation term. this is also the
term that determines the conformal weight of .

it remains to nd what a and b are. from eq.(21), we see that we need
the commutators of + with t0,+ and l+. the rst commutator contributes
the following terms to a and b:

a1 = 

3i
4

0,+, b1 = 

i
4

0,+.

(33)

next, we need the commutator of + with l+. this part of the computation
is a bit more involved, since the expression for l+ given by (11) has to be
regularized, and for this purpose, we found it convenient to use the operator
product expansion. we will rst calculate the ope of 0,+(z) with l+(z),
where z =   , and then convert the result into the equivalent result for the
commutator. in this approach, it is natural to regulate l+ by point splitting.
we let

l+(z)  cij j i

0,+(z + )j j

0,+(z  ),

(34)

11

subtract the term singular in , and let   0 at the end. in this case, because
of the symmetry of cij in i and j, the singular term does not contribute, so
one can forget about it.

starting with the basic ope

0,+(z) j i

0,+(z) =

1
8i

1

z  z (cid:16)i0,+(z) + i0,+(z)(cid:17) ,

(35)

from(34), we have,

0,+(z) l+(z) =

+

cij

z  z +

j i
0,+(z + )j (0,+(z) + 0,+(z  )) .

i (0,+(z) + 0,+(z + )) j j

z  z  

0,+(z  )

(36)

one has to apply the ope (35) once more to the products of the form j0,+0,+
on the right hand side of this equation. after that, the limit   0 can be
taken without encountering any singularities:

1
2

cij

0,+(z)(cid:17)

0,+(z)j0,+(z)(cid:17) .

(37)

the double dots around the composite operators indicate that these terms
have been regulated by subtracting the short distance singularity. by apply-
ing the usual translation

the contributions from the commutator of 0,+ with l+ to a and b are

a2 = cij(cid:18) i

32

ij0,+ : j i

0,+j0,+ :(cid:19) ,

b2 = 

cij ij0,+.

(38)

3i
32

the total values of a and b are obtained by adding up these results:

a = a1 + a2, b = b1 + b2,

12

and we nally have the following transformation law for +:

[+(, ), m( )] =

i

cij ij(cid:19) +.

(39)

a similar calculation for the current j k

(40)

these equations show that both the fundamental fermion and the current
transform linearly, but they have anamolous spin terms. this is equivalent
to the existence of anomalous conformal dimensions. fields with denite
transformation properties are obtained by diagonalizing the matrices that
appear in these equations.

6. conclusions

we have presented a simple model in 1+1 dimensions with a four fermion
interaction term. classically, the interaction term seemed to violate lorentz
invariance. we have shown that, quantum mechanically, for values of the
coupling constants satisfying the master equation, the model is not only
lorentz invariant, but it is conformally invariant as well. apart from the
intrinsic interest of these models, this opens the possibility of utilizing them
for string compactication.
