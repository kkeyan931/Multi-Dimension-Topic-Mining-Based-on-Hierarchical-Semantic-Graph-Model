abstract

the chern-simons formulation of ads3 supergravity is considered. a-
symptotic conditions on the rarita-schwinger elds are given. together
with the known boundary conditions on the bosonic elds, these ensure
that the asymptotic algebra is the superconformal algebra, with the
same central charge as the one of pure gravity. it is also indicated that
the asymptotic dynamics is described by super-liouville.

it has been pointed out in [1] that the asymptotic symmetry group of
anti-de sitter gravity in three dimensions is the conformal group in two
dimensions with a central charge c = 3l/2g. this result was obtained by
working out explicitly the boundary conditions and solving the asymp-
totic killing equations [1]. it has been shown in [2] that the boundary
dynamics at innity is described by liouville theory up to terms involv-
ing the zero modes and the holonomies that were not worked out. in
the following, we will use the chern-simons formulation of ads3 (1,1)-
supergravity and extend the analysis of [1, 2] to the supersymmetric
case. this was originally presented in [3] written in collaboration with
m. banados, o. coussaert, m. henneaux and m. ortiz and we refer to
it for more details.

chern-simons action. ads3 (1,1)-supergravity can be written as a
chern-simons theory [4]. the relevant group is osp(1|2)  osp(1|2)
and the action is:

i[a, ; a, ] = i[a, ]  i[ a, ]

(1.1)

ulb-th-99/16

2

where i[a, ] and i[ a, ] are the chern-simons actions for the super-
group osp(1|2):

i[a, ] =

k

4 z (cid:20)tr(ada +

a3) + i   d(cid:21)

(1.2)

(with a similar expression for i[ a, ]). the constant k is related to the
3d newton constant g and the anti-de sitter radius l through k = l/4g.
the action (1.2) is invariant under the bosonic gauge transformations
a = d,  =  and under the fermionic ones aa = ia,
 = d, where the gauge parameters (a, )  osp(1|2).

boundary conditions. the boundary conditions at innity on the
bosonic elds for an asymptotically ads space have been given in [1] in
the metric representation and they were reexpressed in the connection
representation in [2]. to supplement these conditions by appropriate
boundary conditions on the fermionic elds, one follows the procedure
of [5]: one starts with the known physical metrics that should be included
in the theory - here, the black hole solutions [6] - and acts on them with
the anti-de sitter supergroup. one then obtains, for one osp(1|2) copy,
the following boundary conditions:

av = 0,
ar = b1rb,

v = 0,
r = 0

and

lau = b1(cid:18) 0 l/k

0 (cid:19) b,

1

lu = b1(cid:18) q/k
0 (cid:19)

(1.3)
(1.4)

(1.5)

asymptotically. here, u = t + l, v = t  l and l = l(t, ) and
q = q(t, ) are arbitrary functions which will be shown to be equal to
the generators of the super-virasoro algebra. the group element b(r) is
equal to

b(r) =   (r/l)1/2

0

0

(r/l)1/2 !

(1.6)

the fact that u has one zero component implies that it is an eigen-
state of the radial -matrix, which makes the induced spinors chiral in
two dimensions. the other osp(1|2) elds satisfy analogous boundary
conditions, with u and v interchanged, and depends on two additional
functions l and q. for positive values of l0 and l0, the boundary
conditions (1.5) represent a black hole, with m = (2/k)(l0 + l0) and
j = (2l/k)( l0  l0). anti-de sitter space corresponds to l/k = l/k =
1/4.

asymptotic symmetry. the most general supergauge transforma-
tions that preserve the boundary conditions (1.3), (1.4) and (1.5) are
characterized by gauge parameters (a, ) that must fulll, to leading
order,

(u, r) = b1(u)b, (r, u) = b1(u)

where  denotes derivative with respect to the argument, and  and

components l and q of the connection that remain at innity in the
following way:

(1.12)

this indicates that l and q form a super-virasoro algebra, with a central
charge c equal to 6k (c/12 = k/2).

to express this asymptotic symmetry in terms of poisson brackets,
we note that the canonical generators of the gauge transformations are:

g(a) = z

aga + b, s() = z

s + f.

(1.13)

the boundary terms b and f must be chosen so that the generators g
and s have well-dened functional derivatives [7]. taking into account
the above asymptotic conditions and gauge parameters, one obtains:

b =

2 z

f =

(1.14)

in the reduced phase space (where the constraints are zero), the genera-
tors of the asymptotic symmetry reduce to their boundary term (1.14).
from equations (1.11) and (1.12), we compute their poisson brackets
and we get, after fourier transformation, the asymptotic super-virasoro
algebra:

[lm, ln] = (n  m)ln+m +

(1.17)

with a central charge equal to c = 6k = 3l/2g.

dynamics at innity. following [2] and refering to [3] for details and
references, we note that the chern-simons theory under the boundary
conditions (1.3) induces the chiral wess-zumino-witten model at the
boundary. the other boundary conditions (1.5) turn out to be precisely
the constraints that reduce the wzw theory based on the supergroup
osp(1|2) to chiral 2d supergravity. the two chiral theories are com-
bined to get the non chiral super-liouville theory (up to zero modes and
holonomies). this has been checked at the level of the action, using the
gauss decomposition for osp(1|2).
