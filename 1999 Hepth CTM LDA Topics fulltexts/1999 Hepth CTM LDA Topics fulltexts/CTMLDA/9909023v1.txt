i. introduction

the stable topological excitations (te) can exist in systems with degenerate
minima, which form some manifold m with nontrivial topology. such te take
place in many physical systems, in particular, in superuid he3 and he4 , in
dierent liquid crystals, in magnets. the two main problems are connected with
the existence of te:

1. their classication and properties.
2. their inuence on the properties of the systems.
the most important property of the te is connected with their inuence on
the behaviour of correlations in the systems. in general, this inuence depends
on interrelations between such fundamental properties of the systems as sym-
metry and topology. for example, the inuence of the te is especially strong
in systems with initial scale invariance, since the te introduce in the theory a
new eective mass scale [1]

m  a1 exp(st e),

(1)

where a is some uv cut-o parameter (a core radius or a lattice constant)
and st e is the dimensionless energy (or action) of the te. in the cases,
when one has many te, they can form some textures, ordered or disordered,
which also inuence on behaviour of the systems. in these cases the inuence
depends also on the interaction between te, which, in its turn, is determined
again by interrelations between symmetries and geometry of the systems. if an
interaction of te is strong enough,

it can induce the topological phase transition (tpt) in the system of te,
which can drastically change a character of correlations in system.

this eect, connected with tpt, is well studied in low-dimensional ( d  2 )
systems [2-4,5-9]. in order to understand its main reasons let us resume prop-
erties of such low-dimensional systems.

ii. the te with logarithmic energy

in low-dimensional ns-models

for investigation of the topological properties it is convenient to consider
nonlinear  -models (nsm) on the spaces m , which are the long-wave ap-
proximation of the corresponding ginzburg - landau (gl) type theories. the
topological properties of the space m are described by the homotopic groups
i(m), i = 0, 1, ...

1. d = 2.

the most popular two-dimensional nsm are the next:

1. ns-model on a circle s1 , which is dened by the action [10]

s =

1

2 z d2x||2,  = exp(i)  s1.

(2)

2

the relevant homotopical groups are

i(s1) = 0, i 6= 1,

1(s1) = z.

(3)

due to this, only one type of te, the vortices, exist in this model. under a
vortex one can understand any te (with a nontrivial vorticity or pure potential),
corresponding to 1(s1) = z. the energy of one vortex with topological charge
e  z is logarithmically divergent

e =

e2
2

2 ln

r
a

,

(4)

where r is a space radius. the energy of n -vortex solution, en , with the

full topological charge e = pn
xi6=k

en =

n

2
2

i=1 ei = 0 is nite and equals

eiek ln

|xi  xk|

a

+ c(a)

n

xi

e2
i ,

(5)

here c(a) is some nonuniversal constant, determining self-energy (or a core
energy) of vortices and depending on type of a core regularization. from (5) it
follows that vortices interact through logarithmic potential. just this interaction
of vortices induces the tpt in all 2d systems with continuous abelian symmetry,
described by this nsm [5-7].

2. ns-model on a sphere s2 is dened by action [11]

s =

1

2 z d2x(n)2, n  s2.

the relevant homotopical groups are

i(s2) = 0, i < 2,

2(s2) = z.

(6)

(7)

there is also only one type of te, the instantons, with topological charges q  z
equal to the degree of the corresponding mapping s2  s2. the energy of n
instantons with topological charges qi, i = 1, ..n

en =

4


n

xi=1

|qi|

(8)

thus, the instantons do not interact and only weak, dipole-dipole like, interac-
tion exist between instantons and anti-instantons [10]. the dierent types of
interactions of te in these models is determined by dierent character of te,
corresponding to groups 1(s1) and 2(s2), in d = 2.

in 2d the te, described by 1(s1) , correspond to the
open space boundary and have logarithmic energy,

3

while the te, described by 2(s2) , correspond to the boundary shrinked into
one point and for this they have nite energy.

in principle, in both models the te of vortex and instanton types are possi-
ble. in the rst model the neutral congurations of vortices also correspond
to the shrinked space boundary and could be classied by 2(s1). but, since
2(s1) = 0, all neutral congurations belong to one type. analogously, in
the second model the vortices (or merons) are possible. due to 1(s2) = 0,
they are unstable. their neutral, dipole-like, congurations can have dierent
topological structure, corresponding to 2(s2) = z, and are stable.

analogous situation takes place in

2. 1d systems with long-range interaction of type

j(r)  1/r2.

(9)

this form of j(x) is determined by the scale (even conformal) invariance [12].

the corresponding 1d ns-models have the next hamiltonian

h =

1

2 z dxdxj(x  x)(s(x)  s(x))2.

(10)

here, due to d = 1 , the important manifolds and homotopical groups are

m = {si}, i = 1, ...p,

0({si}) 6= 0,

i = 0, i  1;

m = s1,

1(s1) = z,

where s is a classical spin and a number of discrete spin states p can be nite
or innite [2, 3, 4]. to the discrete set {si} and the open boundary correspond
domain walls or kinks, which connect dierent minima, and to the compactied
space r1 , i.e. s1, correspond 1d instantons, which are really the vortices,
since they correspond to 1(s1) [12, 13].

in 1d case the kinks described by 0({s}) have logarithmic energy
and can induce tpt, while instantons have nite energy and do not interact
between themselves.

resume:

in low-dimensional systems ( d  2 ) the te with logarithmic energy exist

in systems described by

1) conformal invariant ns-models,

2) dened on spaces with discrete abelian group d1 6= 0.

4

these te can induce tpt, which describe such important physical phe-
nomena as localization-delocalization [14], coherence-decoherence [15], melting
[8] and others. all these transitions change a character of correlations in sys-
tems.

then, the two main questions appear:

1) can such te exist in higher-dimensional systems?

2) can they inuence on correlations so strong?

in this talk we propose one model which helps us to answer on the rst

question and can help answer on the second question.

iii. 3d van der waals ns-model on s2

1. motivation.

an investigation of the possibility of existence of the te with logarithmic

energy in 3d scale invariant systems and their inuence on correlations.

2. model.

let us consider 3d lattice with the order parameter (op) n in each lattice

site. the op can be:

1) a unit vector n, n2 = 1, n  s2,
it can represent a magnet;
2) a unit rod or a director n  s2/z2 = rp 2,
it can represent a liquid crystal or molecular crystal.

since the relevant homotopy groups are [16]

2(s2) = 2(rp 2) = z,

3(s2) = 3(rp 2) = z,

(11)

(12)

it will be more convenient to consider the op n  s2. all results will takes
place with non-essential modications for n  rp 2 too. due to its vectorness,
the op can interact by dierent type of interactions:

1) exchange type  (nr  nr)v (r  r) ,
2) dipole-like  (ni
dik(r) = ik  3 xixk
x2
3) van der waals type vvdw (r)  1/r6 .
all they can be represented in the next form

rdik(r  r)nk

,

r )v (r  r) v (r)  1/r3 ,

e  (ni

rdiknk

r)v (r  r),

v (r)  1/r,

(13)

5

where  denes an asymptotic behaviour of the potential v (r).

as a rst approximate attempt to the problem one can compose from all
these types of interaction the simplied one, which must conserve the two main
properties:

1) a scale invariance of the corresponding hamiltonian h,
2) a vectorness of the op.
in result one gets the lattice vector van der waals model with h

h = 

j

2 xr6=r

(nr  nr)vvdw (r  r).

(14)

the analogous approximation, for example, was used by nelson [8] in the theory
of 2d melting.

in long-wave continuous approximation our model passes into the
vector van der waals ns-model with a partition function

svdw [n] = 

1

vvdw (x) = z

zvdw = z dnesvdw [n],
2 z d3xd3x(n(x)n(x))vvdw (x  x),
(2)3 ei(kx)|k|3f (ka)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)|x|a

d3k

where

f (ka) is a regularizing function with next asymptotics

n2 = 1,   1/j,

f (ka)ka1  1 + o(ka),

f (ka)ka1  0.

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

from now on we omit an index vdw vor brevity. a scale invariance of the model
at large distancies follows immediately from large-distance asymptotics of v (x)
and dimensionlessness of the op n. moreover, s is conformal invariant at
large distancies, i.e. it is invariant under conformal transformations:

xi  x

i = xi/x2,

x  x = 1/x,

xi/x = x

i/x,

d3x  d3x/|x|6,

|x1  x2|6 

|x1|6 |x2|6
|x1  x2|6 ,

(19)

and, consequently,

s  z d3x1d3x2

(n1n2)
|x1  x2|6  s

for this reason this model can be named also the 3d conformal ns-model [17].

6

the corresponding euler - lagrange equation has a form

z v (x  x)n(x)d3x  n(x)z (n(x)n(x))v (x  x)d3x = 0.

(20)

the green function g(x) of the conformal kernel v (x) we dene by next
equation

z v (x  x)g(x  x)d3x = (x  x)

(21)

it has the following form

g(x) = z

(22)

and logarithmic asymptotic behaviour.

the action (15) can be represented in a form, admitting a small deviation

expansion of n

s[n] =

1

4 z d3xd3x(n(x)  n(x))2v (x  x).

(23)

in this case in its fourier form can appear a usual,  k2, term which breaks a
scale invariance. then one can consider a more general model, including a local
gradient term in an explicit form

sloc =

1

2 z d3x(n)2.

(24)

this term is not scale invariant in 3d and for this reason the whole action

stot = s + sloc

is also not scale invariant. its form in fourier space will be

stot = sloc + s = z

(25)

(26)

a similar action was obtained earlier in thve theory of liquid crystals [18]. if
in the system there is a point, where a rigidity ( 1
2 + c) = 0 , then in this
point one obtains a scale invariant action (15) with a rst term  k3 . from
a point of view of the gl theory this is similar to the tricritical point, where
a term  4 is absent in the expansion of eective potential of the theory on
nonlinearities [19].

iv. the te with logarithmic energy
in 3d van der waals ns-model on s2

a nontriviality of 2(s2) = z means that in the model there are point-like
te, corresponding to the open boundary. the simplest such excitation is the
hedgehog. it is a solution of equation (20) and has the next asymptotic form

n(x)||x|a

.

the action s of this solution is

s = 4

(2)3 ln(r/a).

(27)

(28)

its topological charge q  z is the degree of the corresponding mapping. the
energy of two hedgehogs with a full topological charge q = 0 is nite and the
interaction of two hedgehogs with charges q1 and q2 on large distancies has
a form of the green function g(x) of the kernel v (x)

h12(r) = e1e2g(r)  e1e2

2

(2)3(2)1/2(3/2)

ln(r/r).

(29)

note that in the usual local 3d ns-model (24) such te have the energy linear
in r

e 

r
 .

(30)

a nontriviality of another homotopical group 3(s2) = z means that the neu-
tral congurations, having a full topological charge equal to 0 and correspond-
ing to the shrinked boundary, can also have dierent topological structures.
they are characterized by topological invariant, coinciding with the

hopf invariant h  z

of the corresponding mapping s3  s2. this invariant is connected with link-
ing number and can be expressed through the integrals over r3 or over com-
pactied space r3  s3. some its properties are described in appendix. just
this invariant is an analog of the topological charge of 2d instantons. note,
that this additional topological invariant classies neutral congurations in
all 3d ns-models dened on sphere s2, in particular, in the usual local model
(24). thus, the hedgehog excitations in 3d van der waals nsm have prop-
erties reminiscent of the mixed properties of the two-dimensional vortices and
instantons:

1) their topology is described by 2(s2) ,
but they interact as vortices through logarithmic potential;
2) their neutral congurations are classied by integer topological
hopf invariant h .

v. discussion, applications

1. a possibility of tpt

the te with logarithmic energy can induce tpt in system of such te.
simple arguments by kosterlitz and thouless show this for any dimensional
case. let us admit that in d-dimensional system there is such te with energy

consider the corresponding free energy f per one such te

e = a ln r/a.

f = e  t s,

where t is a temperature, s is an entropy. one can estimate the entropy of
the te as a logarithm of the number of possible places of the te in space

s = kb ln(r/a)d = kbd ln(r/a).

then one has for free energy of one te

f = e  t s = (a  kbdt ) ln(r/a)

free energy f becomes equal to 0 and changes it sign at

tkt = a/kbd

it means that at t > tkt it becomes energetically favorable to birth such te
and they can generate spontaneously, while at t < tkt one needs positive
free energy to birth these te. more detailed study of this transition in low-
dimensional systems has shown that these arguments correspond to the rst
order approximation in the renorm-group (rg) approach. in higher orders of
rg the contributions, taking into account more detailed information about ge-
ometry of space m, type of the corresponding topological charges and their
interaction, appear in rg equations. in principle, than more complicated topo-
logical structures appear, then dierent complications, destroying this tpt,
become more probable.

in 3d van der waals ns-model there are some additional complications,

which can remove the tpt or complexify its study:

1) additional topological invariant, the hopf invariant h , which distin-

guishes dierent neutral congurations;

2) one needs to conserve a condition, equalizing a rigidity to 0, in order a

logarithmic interaction can not be screened during renormalization;

3) a conformal symmetry, which is, on our opinion, a hidden reason of exis-
tence of tpt in low-dimensional systems, is nite in spaces with d > 2, while
in spaces with d  2 it is innite-dimensional;

9

4) other, not so evident, complications.

2. generalizations.

1. d-dimensional generalization.

the rst condition from the resume denes form of action s in any dimen-

sion and the second one denes partially a topology of m

s =

1

2 z ddxddxa(x) (d)

ab

(x  x)b(x),

where   m, a, b = 1, 2..., n, n is a dimension of m and a form of kernel 
depends on dimension of space d . for decoupled internal and physical spaces
 can be decomposed

(d)

ab (x) = gab2d(x),

where gab is the euclidean metric of the space rn (n) , in which a manifold m
can be embedded. in the momentum space, for small k

2d(k)  |k|d(1 + a1(ka) + ...),

where a is a uv cut-o parameter. action s can be named d -dimensional
conformal nonlinear  -model. the kernel 2d generalizes an usual local and
conformal kernel of two-dimensional  -model

2(k)  22(k) = k2.

for local models an expression for  can be dened in terms of manifold m
only

in odd dimensions 2d is nonlocal

 = gab()2(x)

2d  1/x2d.

the simplest spaces with properties, satisfying the second condition of the re-
sume, are the spheres sd1 . an existence of topological excitations with log-
arithmic energy follows from the invariance of the kernel 2d and the simplest
topologically nontrivial excitations ni = xi/r under scale and conformal trans-
formations

xi  x

i = xi/r2,

r  r = 1/r,

ddx  ddx/|x|2d,

and, consequently,

is invariant and dimensionless. by direct calculation one can show that

s[n]  cd ln

and the dierent excitations interact through potential gd(r), inverse to 2d(r),
which has a logariphmic behaviour at large distancies

gd(r)  ln

r

.

just these conformal kernels and their logarithmic green functions have ap-
peared under consideration of logarithmic gases and equivalent eld theories in
[20].

2. multicomponent generalization for d > 2 .

a simple generalization of the sphere sd1 , analogous to the torus t n in

2d case, is a bouquet of n spheres

bd1

n

= sd1

1

 ...  sd1

n

and all spaces m with this rst nontrivial topological cell complex. but, the
vector topological charges, corresponding to dierent spheres will not interact
as in a case of torus [21]. for obtaining an interaction of topological charges in
3d case one needs to consider ns-models on deformed bd1
. in particular,
3d van der waals ns-models on the maximal ag spaces fg = g/tg of the
simple compact groups g , with 2(fg) = lv, (note that a sphere s2 is a par-
ticular case of fg : s2 = su (2)/u (1) ) will also have topological excitations
with interacting vector topological charges q  lv and logariphmic energy.
since 3(fg) = 3(g) = z,
in this case the neutral congurations will also
have dierent topological structures described by group 3(fg). thus, in these
models the te will have again the mixed properties of the two-dimensional vor-
tices and instantons: their vector topological charges, connected with 2(fg) ,
will interact logarithmically as vortices and their neutral congurations will
have additional topological structure.

n

another interesting possible generalization is the 3d conformal ns-models
on compact groups g. since 2(g) = 0, 3(g) = z , then the instanton-like
te can only exist in these models.

3. applications.

the van der waals nsm, by its construction, is a simplied model of real
systems, consisting from the rod-like molecules, interacting through the van der
waals potential. but, since
topological characteristics depend on rough qualitative properties,
not on some inessential details,

one can hope that

11

the proposed van der waals model can describe the qualitative
properties of some real systems.

an application of ideas, developed under investigation of this model, to the
more realistic, taking into account an anisotropy of the liquid crystals, model
from [18] may be especially interesting.

conclusions

1. the te with logarithmic energies have the most strong inuence on corre-
lations in low-dimensional systems with conformal invariance. they correspond
to the open boundary and to group d1(m) .

2. 3d van der waals  -model is conformal invariant.

3. 3d van der waals  -model on s2 has the pointlike te, the hedgehogs,
with logarithmic energy and topological charges q, corresponding to homotopi-
cal group 2(s2) = z.

4. these te have the mixed properties of the 2d vortices and instantons.
their neutral congurations have dierent topological structures character-
ized by the hopf invariant.

5. the possibility of the tpt in 3d systems induced by these te is dis-

cussed.

6. a generalization of the van der waals ns-model on other dimensions and

multicomponent systems is proposed.

problems, perspectives

3. generalizations and modications.

4. real systems and experiment.

appendix. the hopf invariant h and related facts

the hopf invariant h classies the mappings [16]

s3  s2 = s3/s1.

the last equality means that these mappings are a projection, which projects
some circles s1  s3 into points  s2 .

12

an example of such projection.

let us take s3 as a spere in r4  c2

z1

(|z1|2 + |z2|2)1/2 ,

z2

(|z1|2 + |z2|2)1/2 ,

z1,2  c2,

and a sphere s2 as a complex projective space cp 1, where any pairs of the
next type

gives the same point (here c is arbitrary complex number).

z2 = cz1

the hopf mapping f : s3  s2 can be dened as

for any z2 6= 0. it gives cp 1 , under this all

f : (z1, z2)  z1/z2

with || = 1 gives the same point.

z1, z2,

the unit vector n  s2 under this projection can be dened as

n1 + in2 =

2z1z
2

|z1|2 + |z2|2 , n3 =

|z1|2  |z2|2
|z1|2 + |z2|2

the hopf invariant h is a linking number {1, 2} of two projected circles
1, 2 in s3 , corresponding to dierent points of s2 in general positions, into
which they are projected,

h = {1, 2}

()

it can be represented in dierent integral forms. in r3

{1, 2} =

1

4 i1 i2

< r12  [dr1dr2] >

|r1  r2|3

.

for simple case of one winding of one circle around another h = 1. if a mapping
projects each circle qi (i = 1, 2) times then h = q1q2.

in s3 it can be also represented as

where 1-form  is dened as

h = zs 3

  d,

d = f 1(d).

()

()

here d is a 2-form or an element of the area of s2, f 1 is a mapping inverse
to the projection mapping.

i would like to thank the organizers of the seminar for the opportunity to
give this talk. the conversations with m.kleman and m.monastyrsky were very
useful for preparation of this talk.
