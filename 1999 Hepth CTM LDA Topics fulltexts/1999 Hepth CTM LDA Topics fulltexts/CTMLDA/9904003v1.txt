abstract

straightforward application of the standard noether method in supergravity theories
yields an incorrect superpotential for local supersymmetry transformations, which
gives only half of the correct supercharge. we show how to derive the correct su-
perpotential through lagrangian methods, by applying a criterion proposed recently
by one of us. we verify the equivalence with the hamiltonian formalism. it is also
indicated why the rst-order and second-order formalisms lead to the same super-
potential. we rederive in particular the central extension by the magnetic charge of
the n4 = 2 algebra of sugra asymptotic charges relative to the algebra of local
supersymmetry transformations.

introduction

the problem of dening meaningful conserved charges in gauge theories is
notoriously subtle.
it has been addressed in the literature along various
lines. one approach relies on the use of noether identities and local conser-
vation laws [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. another is based on hamiltonian methods
and asymptotic symmetries [8, 9, 10]. the rst approach is probably the
most familiar and emphasizes locality. it has been recognized, however, that
it suers from ambiguities, which, if improperly resolved, may lead to incor-
rect results. the purpose of this paper is to derive the correct superpotential
for the supercharges in supergravity theories. we show that a natural ap-
plication of the noether identities yields an incorrect supercharge. we then
derive a correct superpotential by adopting the criterion proposed in [11]
and verify equivalence with the hamiltonian approach. finally, we explain
in a rst appendix why the rst-order and second-order formulations yield
the same superpotentials for local supersymmetries. the second appendix
analyses in some detail the case of n4 = 2 supergravity and provides explicit
boundary conditions for the elds that enable one to meaningfully compute
the charges and their algebra.

2 noether superpotential

as shown by e. noether, any global invariance of the action leads to a local
conservation law j  0, where  means equal to when the equations of
motion hold. the conserved noether current is dened through

j = s 

l




(2.1)

where l = s. the elds  may carry an index over which one sums in
(2.1), but this will not be explicitly indicated. in the class of lagrangians
having the same (bulk) euler-lagrange derivative (l  l + k), one
must adjust the surface term in such a way that the action r ddxl = 0 is
truly stationary on-shell. this surface term is xed by a choice of boundary
conditions.

however, even for a given l, there is some ambiguity in the choice of s
since the addition to s of the divergence k of an antisymmetric tensor
k = k does not modify s. expressed in terms of the currents, this
(topological) ambiguity reads

j  j + k

2

(2.2)

and is particularly relevant in the case of gauge symmetries.

indeed, in this case, conserved noether currents j derive from superpo-

tentials,

j  u  , u  = u 

(2.3)

this has been proved in many references (see [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and also
[12] for a cohomological interpretation). the fact that j derives from a
superpotential implies that one can set it equal to zero by means of the
redenitions (2.2).
in other words, everything is in the superpotential,
which indicates how crucial it is to resolve correctly the above-mentioned
ambiguities. a wrong choice would lead to an incorrect integrated charge,

q = zv

dd1x j0  zv

dd2si u 0i

(2.4)

which would e.g. not generate the appropriate transformations through the
poisson bracket.

a natural choice for the superpotential may seem to be

u  =

where the

as are the coecients of the derivatives of the gauge parameters

(2.8)

(we assume for simplicity that only the rst-order derivatives appear). the
choice (2.5) corresponds to taking the coecient of a in s = a
a +
a
a to be symmetric in ,  and may be regarded as being natural on
this ground.

however, this choice is not always correct and does in fact give an incor-

rect supercharge in supergravity for instance.

to see this, note that only the elds that transform into derivatives of the
gauge parameter contribute to the superpotential, and only the piece of the

3

action containing derivatives of these elds is relevant. in all supergravity
theories, the relevant part of the supersymmetry transformations is thus

a

 = a + more

(2.9)

and the relevant piece in the action is the kinetic term for the gravitini2,

(2.10)

(2.11)

as discussed in the rst appendix, one obtains (2.11) by working either in
rst or second order formalism.

although simple, the formula (2.11) is incorrect. it gives only half of the
supercharge as can be seen by comparing with the hamiltonian formalism
[13] or by computing the variation of the supercharge under a supersymme-
try transformation, where one nds only half of the 4-momentum p  instead
of p  itself. the correct supercharge is [13]

q = izs

dd2si a0ika
k

(2.12)

while the integral of j0 given by (2.7), (2.11) is clearly only half of this
expression. that (2.11) is incorrect is perhaps not surprising since it is
well appreciated that there exist in general relativity a plethora of super-
potentials, many of which yield incorrect energy, momentum, or angular
momentum [4, 14]. for a recent and informative discussion, see [15]. we
have just pointed out the supersymmetric extension of this problem. what
is needed is a criterion that selects among the many candidate superpoten-
tials the correct one. such a criterion has been proposed in [11] and tested
with success in many models. we apply below this criterion and show that
it yields the correct supercharge.

2the conventions are the following: ab = {, +, . . . , +}, 01...(d1) = 1, a are d real
majorana matrices and a1...ai := [a1 . . . ai] . the gravitini are described by majorana
spinors.

3 construction of the correct surface integrals at

innity

the approach proposed in [11] is a superpotential-based generalization of
the hamiltonian approach of [9]. it may not always be equivalent to it, but
in the case of theories like supergravity where one can write the lagrangian
in terms of forms and exterior products (in the sense specied after equation
(3.4)), it does yield the same supercharge.

the starting point of [11] is the relationship between the superpotential
and the conserved current associated with a given one parameter group of
gauge transformations of the elds through the noether identities. for any
choice of surface terms, this relationship reads [7]

j
u = u  +

l




aa

(3.1)

with the term proportional to the equations of motion being independent
of the choice. the idea is then to nd a criterion which, given the term
proportional to the equations of motion, completes it in a denite way in
equation (3.1)3.

in the case of supergravity, the supersymmetry current identity is

 =  u 
j

 + a l
 a


=  u 

 + ia(a

 + a

)

(3.2)

where a

 denotes terms containing undierentiated gravitini elds.

if one varies this equation with respect to the gravitini elds4, one gets,

upon integration by parts,

j

 = u 

 + v   i aa

 + iaa


with

v  (, , ) = iaa


(3.3)

(3.4)

note that here v  is antisymmetric in  and . in fact, v  is dened
by (3.3) up to a total divergence, v  = v  + x [], which can in the
3the current in (3.1) is conserved on-shell due to the antisymmetry of u  and the

so-called noether identities, (cid:0) l

 

aa(cid:1) = l

4we will not vary with respect to the other elds since at innity, where the superpo-

tential will be dened, we will assume (other elds)= 0.

present case be adjusted so that v  is antisymmetric in  and . quite
generally, the antisymmetry is guaranteed if the second term in the r.h.s.
of (3.2) can be written as a dierential form functional of  and d (1st
order formulation), d being the exterior derivative. note however that a
priori d-terms must be eliminated for the antisymmetry of v  to follow
automatically.

what is proposed in [11] is to take u  in such a way that the divergence

terms cancel in (3.3), i.e., such that

u 

 + v  = 0

(3.5)

the integration in eld space of this equation is straightforward and leads
to

u 
 = iaa



(3.6)

without the factor one-half (recall that (other elds) = 0 - as stated in [11],
(3.5) must be imposed only at innity). as in the hamiltonian formalism of
[9], equation (3.5) denes the charge up to a constant which can be adjusted
so that the superpotential vanishes for the vacuum. this superpotential is
correct since, contrary to (2.11), it yields the correct supercharges (2.12).
the last two terms of (3.2) are not relevant for charge evaluation. actually
the bulk charge has not yet been dened for singular solutions even in the
presence of horizons.

that the supercharge that follows from (3.5) is the same as the one
obtainable by hamiltonian methods is easy to understand. indeed, one may
identify iv 0i as the surface term that one picks up at the spatial boundary
when breaking the variation of the spatial integral of the eld-equation term
in (3.1)

into a bulk term and a surface term,

= bulk + zs

dd2si v 0i.

(3.8)

where bulk contains only undierentiated variations of the canonical elds.
this identication manifestly holds in supergravity. the only eld equation
that appears in (3.8) is the equation associated with the eld that transforms
into the time derivative of the gauge parameter, i.e. a
0 .

now, it is well-known that the temporal component a

0 of the gravitino
eld is the lagrange multiplier for the supersymmety constraint-generator,

6

namely l
. therefore, the term being varied in (3.8) is of the form la-
 a
0
grange multipliers times hamiltonian constraints. this property, veri-
ed here for supergravity, is actually generic since the lagrange multipliers
transform always into the time derivatives of the gauge parameters (see e.g.
[16]). thus, the zeroth component of the criterion (3.5)

precisely guarantees that the charge

u 0i

q = zx0=c t

dd2si u 0i


(3.9)

(3.10)

has well-dened functional derivatives in the sense of [9], i.e., has a variation
that contains only a bulk part. since the asymptotic equality u 0i
 +v 0i = 0,
together with a covariance argument at innity, implies u 
 + v  = 0
(asymptotically), one may conclude that in the case of supergravity, the
superpotential method supplemented by the criterion of [11] and the hamil-
tonian method are equivalent.

4 conclusions

in this paper, we have shown how superpotential methods apply to local
supersymmetry transformations in supergravity. we have rederived the cor-
rect supercharges. once the supercharges are known, one may compute
their algebra [13, 17]. the case of n4 = 2 supergravity is particularly in-
teresting because the algebra of the supercharges contains central charges.
one of these, the magnetic central charge, arises in exactly the same way
as the conformal central charge in 2 + 1 anti-de sitter gravity [18]: the cen-
tral charge is not seen in the algebra of the asymptotic symmetries, but
does appear in the algebra of their canonical generators. the calculation
is direct. because it lies somewhat outside the main line of this paper, it
is discussed in the second appendix where precise boundary conditions that
include magnetic sources are displayed.

appendix a: superpotential in rst-order and second-
order formalisms

the superpotentials for pure gravity are better understood in a pure 1st
order formalism, i.e. where the connection a
b is varied independently [7].
however, supergravities are usually given in a 2nd-order formulation of the
supersymmetry transformations laws. that is the (spin)-connection is not
treated as an independent eld, and then, its supersymmetry transformation
law is not required. the point of this appendix is to check in the special case
of n4 = 2 supergravity that the above computation of the superpotential
does not depend on which formalism (1st or 2nd order) we are using. this
provides a consistency check for [11]. the same consistency holds for pure
gravity [19].

first of all, the starting point for computing superpotentials is equation
(3.1). in the special case of supergravity, the result was given in (3.2). now,
the only dierence between a 1st or 2nd order computation would come
from a term proportional to the equation of motion of the connection when
computing v  using the second term of the rhs of equation (3.1). however,
if the 1st order formulation of supergravity is such that the supersymmetry
variation of the connection does not contain any term proportional to a,
no additional contribution is expected (recall the denitions (2.8) and (3.1)).
in a parallel publication [20], we will present a general scheme to derive a
pure 1st order formulation from a 1.5 one. that simply requires to compute
a supersymmetry transformation law for the connection. then, the simplest
way to show that the superpotential computation for 1st order formulation is
equivalent to the 2nd order one is to show that this supersymmetry transfor-
mation law does not depend on the derivative of the gauge parameter. this
holds for the n4 = 1 supergravity, where the supersymmetry transformation
law for the connection is [21]:

appendix b: boundary conditions, asymptotic sym-
metry algebra and algebra of charges for n4 = 2
supergravity

to compute the algebra of the charges of n4 = 2 supergravity, one rst needs
to give boundary conditions for the elds at spatial innity that ensure
that the surface integrals yielding the corresponding charges be all nite.
the boundary conditions should also be invariant under the asymptotic
symmetries, i.e., under the asymptotic rigid n = 2 susy algebra. in the
second order formalism, the independent elds of n4 = 2 supergravity are
the tetrads ea
 . the
boundary conditions for the tetrads and the gravitini are given in [9, 13] (the
tetrads approach their minkowskian values up to terms falling o like 1/r
with denite parity conditions, while the gravitini fall o like 1/r2). for this
reason, we shall focus here only on the abelian connection. our treatment
includes magnetic monopoles.

, the abelian connection a and the two gravitini a

9

as in [9, 13], we shall express the boundary conditions in terms of the
canonical variables, which are ak and k (electric eld). to enforce the
lorentz invariance properties of the boundary conditions, it is convenient
to use the improved form of the transformation of the connection under
dieomorphisms, which is

a = f

(b.1)

this is in fact the transformation that arises in the hamiltonian formalism
[22]. indeed, the constraints associated with dieomorphisms are, for n = 2
supergravity,

k are the metric contributions, while hem and hem

the gravitini contributions). we shall only need here the electromagnetic
terms (the gravitational terms do not contribute to the transformations of
the electromagnetic variables, while the spin 3/2 terms can be neglected
asymptotically). one has

(b.5)
(electromagnetic energy density and poynting vector). here, bi is the mag-
netic eld and gij the spatial metric induced on the surfaces x0 = c t; g is its
determinant. its is straightforward to check that r d3x(h + khk), where 
is the displacement normal to the hypersurface x0 = c t and k the tangen-
tial displacement, generates (b.1) when acting on ak through the poisson
bracket. the transformation law (b.1) for a0 follows then from the general
variation of the lagrange multiplier under transformations generated by the
constraints (see e.g.
[16] equation (3.26b) - note that the brackets of the
constraints (b.2) and (b.3) involve the gauss law constraint [22]).

the transformation of the electric eld will also be evaluated through its

poisson bracket with the hamiltonian constraints and is

k = dm(f kmg) + (mk),m k,m m

(b.6)

where dm is the spatial covariant derivative. the transformation (b.6)
coincides on-shell with the standard transformation.

10

to motivate the boundary conditions, consider rst the zero-monopole
in minkowski space, the electromagnetic potential for an electric

sector.
charge at rest at the origin is given by

a0 

e
r

, ak = 0

while the electromagnetic eld behaves as

f0i 

eni
r2 , fij = 0

(b.7)

(b.8)

where ni is the unit radial vector. by boosting this solution, one generates
non-vanishing r1-order terms for ak; these terms have the interesting prop-
erty of being even under the parity n  n. similarly, the leading-order
term in the electromagnetic eld has the property of being odd under the
same parity transformation. these features remain valid if one superposes
various charges.

this suggests taking as boundary conditions at spatial innity (at each

given time)

ak =

a(1)
k (n)
r

+

a(2)
k (n)
r2 + o(r2)

for the spatial components of the connexion and

k =

pk
(1)(n)
r2 +

pk
(2)(n)
r3 + o(r3)

for the electric eld. these conditions imply

fik =

f (1)
ik (n)
r2 +

f (2)
ik (n)
r3 + o(r3)

(b.9)

(b.10)

(b.11)

for the magnetic eld. we impose also that the rst coecients in ak and
k has denite parity properties:

k (n) = a(1)
a(1)

k (n), pk

(1)(n) = pk

(1)(n).

it follows that

ik (n) = f (1)
f (1)

ik (n)

(b.12)

(b.13)

one easily veries that these conditions are invariant under lorentz trans-
formations and futhermore guarantee the vanishing of the boundary term of

11

the variational principle, namely a0i + aj f ji, when integrated at inn-
ity. in fact, the combined asymptotic conditions of [9, 13] and those given
here are invariant under the full rigid n = 2 susy algebra acting at innity.
we shall verify for example the asymptotic lorentz invariance of the
above boundary conditions. the invariance of (b.9) follows from (b.1) and
(b.10), (b.11) and the fact that for boosts and rotations, the leading orders
of  and k are both parity-odd. similarly, the invariance of (b.10) follows
from (b.6) and the same observation on the parity of the leading orders of
 and k. one should stress that the boundary conditions adopted here can
probably be somewhat relaxed. however, our goal is not to provide here the
most exible admissible boundary behaviour, but to give a consistent and
complete set of boundary conditions that enforce asymptotically the n = 2
supersymmetry algebra.

the asymptotic symmetry algebra may actually involve also a central
u (1). this issue is somewhat subtle because there is no charged eld in
n4 = 2 (ungauged) supergravity. whether there is a non trivial u (1) at
innity depends on the topology of the spatial sections. to see this, one
notes that the boundary conditions on the potential are invariant under
gauge transformations that behave asymptotically as

with

a = 

 = 0 + (n) + o(r0)

where 0 is a constant and (n) is parity-odd,

(n) = (n).

(b.14)

(b.15)

(b.16)

however, the transformations associated with (n) are really irrelevant be-
cause their corresponding charges, given by the ux of the electric eld times
(n) at innity (up to non-written gauss law constraint terms)

q[(n)] = zs

(n)  ds

(b.17)

all vanish identically for the eld congurations allowed here. thus, one
can factor them out. these transformations are somewhat the analogs of
the supertranslations of the bms group, which are eliminated in the same
way through the parity conditions [9].
in fact, the main motivation for
adopting similar parity conditions on the electromagnetic potential is to ef-
fectively remove the charges (b.17), which do not seem to have a direct

12

physical interpretation (these charges are not associated with higher multi-
pole moments).

thus, only the constant piece 0 in (b.15) is relevant. the charge asso-
ciated with gauge transformation that tend to a constant at innity reads
(again up to unwritten gauss law terms)

q[0] = 0zs

  ds.

(b.18)

there may be additional surface terms if there are other boundaries (other
asymptotic regions, or other surfaces on which boundary conditions are re-
quired: horizons, surfaces surrounding singularities), but since we are inter-
ested here only in the asymptotic symmetry generators in a single asymptotic
region (called innity), we shall consider gauge transformations that are
zero except in a vicinity of this asymptotic region. these gauge transforma-
tions are correctly generated by (b.18), without any other surface contri-
bution. being zero at the other boundaries (if any) they certainly preserve
any set of specic boundary conditions given there.

now, whether (b.18) identically vanishes or not depends on the topology
if these are homeomorphic to r3, then (b.18) is
of the spatial sections.
zero by gauss law and there is no non trivial u (1) asymptotic generator.
however, if the 2-sphere at innity is not contractible, (b.18) needs not
vanish (charge without charge). furthermore, as a generator, (b.18) acts
non trivially on the gauge-invariant mandelstam variables

m = z

dxkak

(b.19)

where  is any path joining the asymptotic region being considered to any
other asymptotic region. the variable m is invariant under proper gauge
transformations, i.e., under gauge transformations that vanish on all bound-
aries. in that sense, it is an observable. however, it is not invariant under
global transformations characterized by a non-vanishing 0 provided it ends
outside the component of innity under consideration. one gets m = 0,
which implies that m is conjugate to the electric charge measured at innity,

[m,zs

  ds] = 1

(b.20)

(again, we do not write explicitly the constraint terms that accompany the
surface integral at innity). there is thus a non-trivial u (1) generator at
innity, which generates asymptotic symmetries.

13

note that one would also nd u (1) symmetries on the other boundaries.
the sum over all boundaries of the u (1) charges is zero by gauss law (the
ux lines can only end on the boundaries). the fact that the charges add up
to zero just reects the fact that the generator associated with everywhere
constant gauge transformations vanishes, as it should (such transformations
have no action on the elds).

the inclusion of magnetic charges is direct. instead of imposing (b.9)

on the potential ak, one requires that it behaves asymptotically as

ak = amon

k + a
k

(b.21)

k

where amon
is the potential for the magnetic monopole(s), living on a non-
trivial u (1) bundle over s2 (and dened over patches), while a
k is globally
dened and subject to the same boundary conditions (b.9). the bound-
ary conditions on the electric eld are unchanged. the magnetic eld has
also the same asymptotic behaviour because the eld of a monopole obeys
(b.11). these more general boundary conditions are still lorentz invari-
ant because the variation of amon
, which is globally dened, behaves as
a
k. they are in fact also invariant under supersymmetry transformations
and constant gauge transformations. furthermore, the (graded) commuta-
tor of two local supersymmetry transformations that tend asymptotically to
constants a and  a is the sum of a dieomorphism that becomes asymptot-
ically a translation with parameter i2a a and a gauge transformation
that behaves at innity as a constant gauge transformation with parameter
 = iaa
b b (the asymptotic value of the gauge transformation is de-
ned up to a constant, but the ambiguity disappears if one imposes that 
vanishes when  or  is equal to zero). there is no sign of the magnetic charge
in the asymptotic algebra of the asymptotic symmetry transformations.

k

let us turn now to the algebra of the charges dened, in the lagrangian
context, through the variations of the charges under the transformations
generated by one another. the variation of the superpotential was given in
equation (3.5), together with the result (3.4) for supergravity theories. now
in the special case where  is another supersymmetry gauge transformation,
that is  := , the variation becomes:

where we used the (n4 = 2)-hatted covariant derivative dened in

1. the rst term in the rhs of (b.22) is nothing but the nester-witten
superpotential [23], and so the covariant version of adm mass (and
momentum). we will denote it by h, where  is an asymptotic
displacement and is given by  = i2a a. the idea of relating
the positivity of gravitational mass and local supersymmetry can be
found in [24]. the supergravity origin and positivity of the nester-
witten superpotential [23] was already established for the n4 = 1
supergravity in [25].

2. the second term gives electric and magnetic contributions (central
charges) to the algebra of supersymmetry. due to the asymptotic
behavior of the gravitino (falling o like 1/r2), the hatted eld strength
can be replaced by the ordinary eld strength, the dierence between
both falling o like 1/r4.

let us dene:

q := zs (cid:16)iaa

b b(cid:17) f 0i

and p := zs (cid:16)iaa

b5 b(cid:17) f 0i

then we nd that the algebra of the susy charges (which generate the
asymptotic supersymmetric invariance of n4 = 2 supergravity) has a mag-
netic central charge besides the expected u (1) generator. these are familiar
from rigid supersymmetry. explicitly, we nd the algebra

q := [q, q] = h + q + p

(b.23)

in agreement with [13, 17]. the electric and magnetic charges appear as
central charges for the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra. there is, however,
an apparent dierence between the two in the present (electric) formulation
of n4 = 2 supergravity. while the noetherian electric charge is a non trivial
generator which does act on some canonical elds (when it does not vanish
identically), the magnetic charge commutes with all of them and not just
with the other generators of the asymptotic symmetry algebra, even when
it is non zero. it is (in this limited treatment) a fully central charge.

it is customary to adjust the constants in the generators of the asymp-
totic symmetries so that these vanish on some specied background. when

15

specialized to that background, (b.23) becomes

q = p on background

(b.24)

(h = 0, q = 0). the central charge is the variation of the background
generator of asymptotic supersymmetries. the magnetic central charge can
(and does) arise because the electromagnetic eld on a non-trivial u (1)-
bundle is non zero and breaks some of the supersymmetries ( q 6= 0).
note that in a dual (magnetic) formulation the role of electric and mag-
netic charges would be exchanged, a fully duality invariant treatment should
restore the symmetry between the two.

the algebra of the asymptotic symmetry transformations (once more de-
ned on the electric canonical variables) and the algebra of their generators
are dierent. the algebra (b.23) gives another example of the general the-
orem of [27] which establishes that extra central charges are allowed in the
asymptotic charge algebras. this has been already used in [18] and gener-
alises the classical ambiguity of the charge algebra relative to the symmetry
algebra in hamiltonian dynamics.
