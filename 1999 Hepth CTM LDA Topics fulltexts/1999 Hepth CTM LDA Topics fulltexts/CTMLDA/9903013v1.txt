a classical result of susy eld theory in four spacetime dimensions is that the target
spaces of rigid supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models must be kahler manifolds [1]
when n = 1 and hyperkahler manifolds [2] for n = 2. the hyperkahler manifolds form
a subspace in the family of kahler manifolds of complex dimension 2n and possess more
restrictive properties as compared to general kahler ones (three independent parallel
complex structures, ricci-atness, sp(n) holonomy versus u(2n) in general), see [3] for
a review. remarkably, there exist at least two constructions which generate hyperkahler
manifolds of complex dimension 2n from kahler manifolds of complex dimension n. the
rst example is provided by the famous c-map [4] in the limit of rigid supersymmetry.
one starts with a holomorphic prepotential f (z i), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, destined to generate
the so-called rigid special kahler geometry [5] whose potential and metric read

g(z, z) = fi(z)z i + f i(z)z i ,

gij(z, z) = fij(z) + f ij(z) .

(1)

then, it turns out that the following potential

h(z, z, w, w ) = g(z, z) +

2

gij(z, z)(wi + w i)(wj + w j)

(2)

corresponds to a hyperkahler manifold [4]. the second example has its origin in the sem-
inal paper of calabi [6] where the concept of hyperkahler manifolds was introduced. in
[6] calabi showed that the cotangent bundles of complex projective spaces cp n are hy-
perkahler manifolds. it was long conjectured and recently proved [7] that the holomorphic
cotangent bundles of general kahler manifolds admit hyperkahler structures. therefore,
one can associate an n = 2 supersymmetric sigma model with any kahler manifold. such
manifestly n = 2 supersymmetric sigma models have been described in our recent paper
[8]. below we will present a review of our construction.

let us start by recalling a general n = 1 rigid supersymmetric sigma model [1]. the
i whose physical scalar

model is described by chiral superelds i and their conjugates 
components ai and a

i parametrize a kahler manifold m. the action reads

s[, ] = z d8z k(i, 

j )

(3)

where k(a, a) is the kahler potential of m.

an n = 2 supersymmetric extension of (1), in which we are here interested, is given

in n = 1 superspace by

s[, ] = z d8zh 1

2i i dw

k(i(w), 

i(w)) i

.

for (w) and (w) we have

i(w) =



xn=0

n(z)wn = i (z) + wi(z) + o(w2) ,



i(w) =



xn=0

with  being chiral,  being complex linear, and the remaining component superelds
being unconstrained complex superelds. the superelds  and  are constrained by

d  = 0 ,

d2 = 0

(6)

and provide two distinct o-shell realizations of n = 1 scalar multiplets. the role of the
auxiliary superelds 2, 3, . . ., is to ensure a linearly realized n = 2 supersymmetry.
the expansions in (5) describe polar multiplets in the nomenclature of [9].

the n = 2 sigma model introduced respects all the geometric features of its n = 1

predecessor in (3). the kahler invariance of (3)

turns into

k(, )  k(, ) + (cid:16)() + ( )(cid:17)

k(, )  k(, ) + (cid:16)() + ( )(cid:17)

(7)

(8)

for the model (3). a holomorphic reparametrization ai  f i(a) of the kahler manifold
has the following counterparts

i  f i() ,

i(w)  f i((w))

(9)

in the n = 1 and 2 cases, respectively. therefore, the physical superelds of the n = 2
theory

= i ,

(10)

= i ,

i(w)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)w=0

di(w)

dw (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)w=0

should be regarded, respectively, as a coordinate of the kahler manifold and a tangent
vector at point  of the same manifold. that is why the variables (i , j ) parametrize
the tangent bundle t m of the kahler manifold m.

the presence of auxiliary superelds 2, 3, . . ., in (5) makes n = 2 supersymmetry
manifest, but the physical content of the theory is hidden. to describe the theory in
terms of the physical superelds  and  only, all the auxiliary superelds have to be
eliminated with the aid of the corresponding algebraic equations of motion

their solution (w) can be found only perturbatively for general kahler manifolds.
remarkably, there exist numbers of special cses, for instance, the four series of compact
kahler symmetric spaces (see, e.g. [3, 10])

(12)

for which the equations (11) can be solved exactly, according to the rules given in [8]. the
specic feature of the compact kahler symmetric spaces is that eqs. (11) are equivalent
to the holomorphic geodesic equation

(15)

to get a better feel for this construction, let us consider the simple example of cp n =

su(n + 1)/u(n) in the role of the kahler manifold m. for cp n we have

k(, ) = r2 ln(cid:18)1 +

as is seen, the action is well dened when ||2  gi j i 
j < r2. under this restriction we
can represent the second term in (17) by a taylor series in ||2, and the series is nothing
but an expansion in powers of the curvature of cp n.

we can turn this to our advantage to obtain some partial information about the ten-
jp that appear in (14). since the curvature of cp n is covariantly constant,
sors ri1 ip
jp that are not dependent
the expansion of (17) xes the form of all the terms in ri1 ip
of any derivatives of the kahler manifold curvature. appealing to universality, we suggest
that these tensors in (14) should not be strongly dependent on the choice of a particu-
lar kahler manifold. by this assertion, it follows that all the non-derivative terms in
jp are xed by the series expansion of the logarithm in (17). of course, a really
ri1 ip
comprehensive understanding of this opproach requires a completely explicit description
jp which presently lies beyond our grasp. this a topic for future investigation.

the lagrangian of the n = 2 supersymmetric model (14) cannot yet be identied with
a hyperkahler potential. the point is that for n = 1 rigid supersymmetric models their
lagrangians coincide with kahler potentials only if all the dynamical variables are chiral
superelds. but our model (14) is described by chiral superelds i (parametrizing the
base kahler manifold) and by complex linear ones i (parametrizing the tangent bers).
it remains, however, to full one more step  to dualize the linear superelds i into
chiral ones i, d i = 0, via the legendre transform

stb[, , , ]  s[, , u, u, , ] = stb[, , u, u]  z d8znu ii + c.c.o (18)

with the auxiliary superelds u i being complex unconstrained. by construction, {u i }
is a tangent vector at point  of m, therefore {i} is a one-form at the same point.
eliminating the auxiliary variables u i and u
j in (18), with the aid of their equations of
motion, results in a purely chiral sigma model scb[, , , ] which is dually equivalent
to the n = 2 supersymmetric model (14) and is dened on the cotangent bundle t m.
therefore, the supereld lagrangian for scb[, , , ] coincides with the hyperkahler
potential of t m. in particular, if one applies the legendre transform described to the
model (), one exactly reproduces the hyperkahler potential on the complete cotangent
bundle t (cp n) [6, 10], see [8] for more details.

in conclusion, we would like to point out that the c-map hyperkahler potential (2)
is generated by a self-coupling of n = 2 tensor multiplets. as concerns the hyperkahler
structures on the cotangent bundles of kahler manifolds, the above consideration shows
these are generated by self-couplings of n = 2 polar multiplets.
