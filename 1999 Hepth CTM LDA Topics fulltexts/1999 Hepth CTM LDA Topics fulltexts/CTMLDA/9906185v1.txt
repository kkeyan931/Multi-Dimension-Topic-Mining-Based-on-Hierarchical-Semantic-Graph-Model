abstract

we propose a new approach to the study of the correlation functions of w -algebras.
the conformal blocks (chiral correlation functions), for xed arguments, are dened to
be those linear functionals on the product of the highest weight (h.w.) representation
spaces which satisfy the ward identities. first we investigate the dimension of the chiral
correlation functions in the case when there is no singular vector in any of the repre-
sentations. then we pass to the analysis of the completely degenerate representations.
a special subspace of the h.w. representation spaces, introduced by nahm, plays an
important role in the considerations. the structure of these subspaces shows a deep
connection with the quantum and classical toda models and relates certain completely
degenerate representations of the wg algebra to representations of g. this is conrmed
by an analysis for the virasoro, wa2 and wbc2 algebra. we also relate our work to
nahms, feigen-fuchs and watts results.

introduction

two dimensional conformal eld theories have wide range of applications. they describe
the critical behaviour of two dimensional statistical physical models since at the second order
phase transition point the theory is scale and consequently conformal invariant. the conformal
invariance in string theory arises as a remnant of the reparametrization invariance of the
worldsheet which guarantees that the physics does not depend on the coordinate choices. the
success of conformal eld theories and the reason of their mathematical applications are due
to the fact that they possess innite dimensional symmetry algebras, which help to solve the
models. these algebras necessarily contain the conformal or virasoro algebra, in most cases
however, they are larger. the extensions of the conformal algebra are called w -algebras.

the analysis of the w -symmetric theories, theories whose symmetry algebra is a w -
algebra, can be divided into two steps. the rst concerns the investigation of the symmetry
algebra itself. it contains the presentation of the algebra, which can be done by commutation
relations or by localizing it as a subalgebra in a known algebra, etc. . then the representation
theory of the symmetry algebra has to be developed concentrating on the irreducibility of the
representations and the singular vectors. the next step is the solution of a model with a given
w -symmetry. this means the determination of the correlation functions, which is usually
done either by solving the dierential equations that arises from the decoupling equations of
the singular vectors, or by using some auxiliary eld technics.

in most cases the analysis of w -symmetric theories was focused on the symmetry algebra
and their representation theory on one hand [8], or concentrated on auxiliary constructions
which work well in principle only for rational theories, on the other hand [7, 10]. in the string
theoretical applications, however, nonrational and rational theories are equally important. in
calabi-yau theories the theory and consequently the symmetry algebra depend on several
parameters, which not necessarily take rational values.

in this paper we concentrate on the second step, ie. we try to analyse the correlation
functions of general w -symmetric models. for this we give a new denition for the conformal
blocks, placing emphasis on the generality and calculability.

the denition of the chiral correlation functions or conformal blocks presented here is the
adaptation what was used by felder for kac-moody algebras in [1]. in principle the conformal
blocks are dened to be those linear functionals on the product of the highest weight (h.w.)
representation spaces that respect the ward identities. the simple idea behind this can be
understood in the following way: consider a correlation function of some descendant eld in
the virasoro theory

dz
2i

h1(z1) . . . lni(zi) . . . n (zn )i = ici

h1(z1) . . . (zzi)n+1l(z)i(zi) . . . n (zn )i , n < 0,
(1)
where all insertion points, {zi}, are dierent and none is zero or innite. here and from
now on ci denotes a small integration contour around zi. now we can make a usual contour
deformation. observe that n < 0 so there is no pole at innity and at zero (this is also true
for n < 2 due to the quasi primary nature of l(z)). consequently we obtain the following

2

formula:

h1(z1) . . . lni(zi) . . . n (zn )i =  xj:j6=iicj

dz
2i

h1(z1) . . . (z  zi)n+1l(z)j(zj) . . . n (zn )i.

(2)
expanding (z  zi)n+1 around zj we get an innite sum, each term of it being associated with
an action of the virasoro algebra. since we are working with h.w. representations the sum is
nite and we end up with a well-dened action. denoting the sum by ln we have:

h1(z1) . . . lni(zi) . . . n (zn )i =  xj:j6=i

h1(z1) . . . lnj(zj) . . . n (zn )i.

(3)

in the singular terms of the operator product expansion we can replace l1j(zj) by zj j(zj)
and l0j(zj) by hjj(zj) and recover the well-known ward identities. (this relation will be
used to dene the conformal blocks later).

doing the same in the wa2 theory we realize a problem which concerns the modes w1 and
w2: consider a correlation function of some w -descendants in a model with wa2 symmetry:

h1(z1) . . . wni(zi) . . . n (zn )i = ici

h1(z1) . . . (zzi)n+2w (z)i(zi) . . . n (zn )i , n < 0.
(4)
next we do the same contour deformation manipulations as before and expand the (z  zi)n+2
term around zj. the sum gives rise to a well-dened operator on h.w. w -primary elds which
is denoted by wn with which the result is:

dz
2i

h1(z1) . . . wni(zi) . . . n (zn )i =  xj:j6=i

h1(z1) . . . wnj(zj) . . . n (zn )i.

(5)

there is an important dierence compared to the virasoro theory. namely in the singular
terms of the ope one can only replace w0j(zj) by wjj(zj), but in principle one cannot
relate the descendant elds w1j(zj) and w2j(zj) to the primary eld j(zj). in the
virasoro theory l1 has a nice interpretation as the dierentiation operator however this fails
in the w -case.

what to do now?
we will give up in some sense the l1 =  relation and reformulate the technics described
above in our new framework. we will see that relevant algebraic questions like the dimension
of the conformal blocks, or the vanishing of the two and three point functions (the possible
couplings), can be analyzed without using the l1 =  relation.

we start with the virasoro symmetric models in section 1. the aim of this section is to
reexplorer the well-known results of the conformal symmetric models in order to be getting
acquainted with the new framework. in doing so we dene the space of the conformal blocks to
be the space of those linear functionals on the product of the h.w. representation spaces which
satisfy the ward identities (2). then the dimension of the two point functions is investigated,
and it is shown that it is one if the conformal dimensions coincide and zero otherwise. in the
case of the three point functions we analyse various things. the dimension of the space of the
three point functions is one for arbitrary representations. if one of the representations has a
singular vector than xing one from the remaining weights and supposing non vanishing three

3

point functions we can determine the possible values for the last weight. we also comment
on the fusion dened by feigin and fuchs. in the case of the four point function we show
that its dimension is innite in general. moreover if there is a singular vector in any of
the representation at level n then the dimension of the space of the conformal blocks is not
greater than n. after considering the general n-point functions we dene the z-dependence of
the conformal blocks via the friedan-shenker connection. geometrically the conformal blocks
are horizontal sections of a holomorphic bundle. although this approach naturally generalizes
to higher genus surfaces we restrict our attention to the sphere. in this paper we focus on
the algebraic and not on the geometric aspects and on the way it can be extended to general
w -algebras.

in generalising we start with the simplest w -algebra, namely with theories having the
wa2 algebra, [20], as the symmetry algebra in section 2. we dene the space of the conformal
blocks in an analogous manner namely by means of the ward identities. then the dimension
of the space of the correlation functions is investigated.
it is shown that a nonvanishing
two point function implies that the virasoro weights are the same and the w -weights are
opposite.
in the case of the three point functions even the dimension of the space of the
conformal blocks is innite in the general case. in analysing the three point functions it turns
out that a special subspace of the h.w. representation spaces plays a very important role.
this space is a factor space spanned by those negative modes that annihilate the vacuum
modulo those that do not.

in the case of a general w -algebra we give the denition of the conformal blocks and
analyse the dimension of the space of the correlation functions. the z-dependence of the
correlation function is dened similarly to the virasoro case.

in any of the consideration the special subspace of the h.w. representation space plays a
crucial role. if one associate for a h.w. representation of g a h.w. representation of wg ,
then the dimension of the special subspace coincides with the dimension of the underlying
representation. this connection can be made more explicit with the help of the singular
vectors of the representation and by exploiting the relation with the classical toda models.
this is illustrated in section 4.

the relation between the classical and quantum representations is supported by the ex-

ample of the b2 and c2 toda models which are given in the appendix.

2 the virasoro theory

let  be the riemann sphere with n distinct points p1, . . . , pn . for the point pi we associate
an irreducible h.w. representation of the virasoro algebra, vi, and denote the product of the
representations by v = v1  v2  . . . vn. we choose coordinate functions on the two covering
neighbourhoods on the sphere: z and w = 1/z and write z(pi) = zi. introduce the space of
meromorphic vector elds on the sphere with poles at zi:

w 2( \ {pi}) = (f (z) meromorphic |

f (z)

d
dz

holomorphic except z1, . . . , zn) .

(6)

(we note that d
dz are holomorphic everywhere.) in the following we use the abbre-
viation w 2 = w 2( \ {pi}). for each function f  w 2 one can associate an action of the

dz , z2 d

dz , z d

4

virasoro algebra on v in the following way. make a laurent expansion of f (z) around zi
and for the (z  zi)k+1 term associate the action of lk on vi and consequently the action of
1  . . .  lk  . . .  1 on v , for which we write l(i)
k . since the functions of w 2 are spanned
by the functions of the form (z  zi)n , n < 3, we give the action explicitly for these:

(z  zi)n  l(i)

n1 + xl:l6=i

l(l)

n1,

where we have to make a dierence depending on whether n > 0 or n  0. in these cases

l(l)

n1 = ( (1)np

k)l(l)
k=0 znk
(n

n1 )l(l)

k1 n > 0
n  0

(7)

(8)

(9)

although we have an innite sum in l(l)
on h.w. representation spaces. we note that any mode that appears in l(l)
vacuum and its index is grater than n  1 (if n < 1).

n1 only nitely many terms contribute when it acts
n1 annihilates the

the conformal blocks or chiral correlation functions assign a complex number to xed
insertion points {zi} and associated representations vi, in such a way, that the ward identity
(2) holds. reformulating this we dene the space of the conformal blocks associated to v
and {pi} to be the space of those linear functionals on v that is annihilated by w 2 (for the
natural right action), ie.

e (v, {pi}) = nu  v  | u(xv) = 0 ;

v  v , x  w 2o .

we will vary the insertion points and consider the z-dependence later, now we focus on the
dimension of the space of the conformal blocks.

we start with the two point function h1(z1)2(z2)i. consider a conformal block u acting

on a general element

v = ln1 . . . lnk|1i  lm1 . . . lml|2i, ni  ni+1, mi  mi+1

(10)

of the product of the h.w. representation spaces. (the h.w. representation spaces are graded,
the eigenvalue of the operator l0 is the level. this grading naturally extends to v : the levels
sum up). now if v contains a mode ln , n > 1 then without loss of generality we have

n1 + l(2)



 l(2)

n1v



,

(11)

v = (cid:16)l(1)

n1(cid:17) v

where clearly v  = ln2 . . . lnk |1i  lm1 . . . lml|2i. since u annihilates the rst term
u(v) = u(v ), where v  =  l(2)
n1v . note that the terms in v  have level smaller than the level
of v. this means that the value of the conformal block acting on a general element can be
expressed with its values acting on vectors with smaller level. since we are working with h.w.
representation spaces the levels are bounded from below, so applying this procedure from level
to level we can eliminate all the modes, which are not l1. consequently we analyse the case
of the vector v of the form v = (l1)n |1i  (l1)m |2i. up to now we have not used the

5

constraints coming from the everywhere homomorphic (global) transformations, which are:

1 + l(2)
0 + l(2)
1 + l(2)

u(cid:16)(l(1)
u(cid:16)(l(1)
u(cid:16)(l(1)

1)v(cid:17) = u(cid:16)(l(1)
0 )v(cid:17) = u(cid:16)(l(1)
1 )v(cid:17) = u(cid:16)(l(1)

1 + l(2)
0 + l(2)
1 + l(2)

1)v(cid:17) = 0
0 + z2

21l(2)

1)v(cid:17) = 0.

(12)

two of the equations above can be used to eliminate all the l1-s. using an appropriate
combination of all the three we have one more constraint, which reads on v = |1i  |2i as:

u(cid:16)(cid:16)l(1)

1 + l(2)

1 + z21(l(1)

0 + l(2)

0  l(1)

0 )u (v) = 0.

0 |2i = h2 = h1 possibility for the other. consequently the dimension of the space of

1 on the h.w. vectors. the global transformations restrict this space as:

now we analyse the three point functions with insertion points z1, z2, z3. the argument
used above to eliminate the modes ln , n < 1 generalises naturally for this case, so it
is enough to take into account the elements of the h.w. representation spaces generated by
acting l(i)
u(cid:16)(l(1)
u(cid:16)(l(1)
u(cid:16)(l(1)

1)v(cid:17) = u(cid:16)(l(1)
0 )v(cid:17) = u(cid:16)(l(1)
1 )v(cid:17) = u(cid:16)(l(1)

1 + (2  3))v(cid:17) = 0
0 + z21l(2)
1 + 2z21l(2)

0 + z2

1 + l(3)
0 + l(3)
1 + l(3)

1 + (2  3))v(cid:17) = 0.

1 + l(2)
0 + l(2)
1 + l(2)

now we can make dierent interpretations. we can x say all the three l0 eigenvalues. in
this case all the l(i)
1-s can be eliminated, and no other constraints remain. this shows that
the dimension of the chiral three point function is one for all possible h.w. vectors.

(14)

in order to interpret the results in another way we can express l(1)

0 as:

z21l(1)

0 = l(1)

1 + l(2)

1 + l(3)

1 + z21l(2)

0 + (z31 + z32)l(3)

0 + z31z32l3
1

(15)

0 = h2 and l(3)

now we can x the eigenvalue l(2)
0 = h3 and investigate the possible weights
l(1)
that can couple two them. we see that there are innitely many possible values for l(1)
0 ,
0
the symmetry does not restrict the possible couplings. of course this will change drastically if
we have singular vectors in the third representation space. we come back later to investigate
this.

now consider the case of the n point functions with insertion points: z1, z2, . . . zn . the
analysis follow the same line we used for the two and three point functions. we show that the
value of the conformal block, u, on the general vector

v = ln1 . . . lnk|1i  . . .  lm1 . . . lml|n i,

(16)

(where ni  ni+1 , mi  mi+1), can be re-expressed in terms of its values on vectors at lower
level, if v contains operators ln, n > 1. suppose that at the position i we have a mode

6

lj1 , j > 0, ie. v = l(i)

blocks, we get u(v) = u(v ) where v  = pl:l6=i

j1v . in this case, using the dening relations of the conformal
j1v . each term in v  has smaller level
than the level of v. following this procedure we can eliminate all the modes inductively in
the level, which are not l1. the induction becomes complete since at the lowest levels we
have vectors containing only l1-s. this shows that it is enough to dene the value of the
conformal blocks on the vectors containing only l1. they are not all independent however,
since we have the global ward identities:

l(l)

u(cid:16)(l(i)
u(cid:16)(l(i)
u(cid:16)(l(i)

1))v(cid:17) = 0
1))v(cid:17) = 0.
lil(l)
0 + z2

(17)

by the help of these equations we can eliminate the l1 modes in three arbitrary representa-
tions, however the others remain undetermined. this shows that the dimension of the space
of the n-point functions is innite in the general case. (sometimes we omit to write out the
conformal block, u, in relations like above).

focusing on the four point case we have to dene the values of the conformal blocks on the
vectors: |1i  |2i  |3i  (l1)n |4i. this space is innite dimensional in the general case.
if however the representation corresponding to 4 is degenerate, then it contains a singular
vector at some level, say n , of the form ((l1)n + . . .) |4i = 0. this shows that it is enough
to dene ui = u(cid:16)(l(4)
1)iv(cid:17) , i < n, all others can be re-expressed in terms of these, ie. the

dimension of the space of the conformal blocks is n in this case, which is the level of the
singular vector.

now consider the eect of the singular vectors in the case of the three point functions.
can be expressed in terms of

1(cid:17)n
in equation (15) l0 becomes an n  n matrix since (cid:16)l(3)
1(cid:17)k
(cid:16)l(3)
0 = h2 we can diagonalize l(1)

to obtain the possible nonvanishing
couplings. clearly the number of the nonzero couplings is bounded by the level of the singular
vector.

, k < n. fixing l(2)

we analyse the degenerate representaions starting from the simplest cases. the simplest
degenerate representation is the vacuum representation it contains a singular vector at level
one of the form l1|3i = 0. since l(3)
|3i = 0 for i = 1, 0, 1 then the analysis of the
possible couplings reduces for the same analysis, what we have performed in the two point
case, ie. l(1)

0 = l(2)
0 .

the next simplest representation contains a singular vector at level two: (l2

which is a consequence of the denition of the conformal blocks. all the relations are valid
when they act on conformal blocks on the right. using the global transformations we can
express l(2)

matrix:

(20)

this matrix looks a bit complicated, however it turns out that its eigenvalues are z-independent.
this leads to take the z1  , z2  1 and z3  0 limit. in this case the matrix takes the
following simple form:

0 =   h2 + h3
l(1)

1

ah2

h2 + h3 + 1  a !

(21)

now if we use the standard parametrisation, h(r, s) = ((rts)2 (t1)2)/4t, then h3 = h(2, 1)
and for h2 = h(r, s) the eigenvalues become h(r + 1, s) and h(r  1, s). this is very similar to
the fusion of the fundamental representation of sl2.

since the eigenvalues are z-independent we can take the limit above at the beginning. the

resulting ward identities can be described as

l(2)
0 = l(3)
l(1)
0 = l(3)
0 = l(3)

(22)

these relations hold when acting on conformal blocks on the right. these are the operators
used by feigin and fuchs in [12]. they considered a given representation 3 and analysed the
possible values for l(1)
0 . the restriction comes from the decoupling of the singular
0 and l(2)
vectors of the third representation, which can be expressed as a polynomial in l(1)
0 .
the z-dependence of the correlation functions can be described in the following way:
the conguration space where the arguments of the correlation function take values are

0 and l(2)

cn = n{z1, . . . zn }  n , zi 6= zjo. now take an open neighbourhood, u, of a point in

the conguration space and associate with it a holomorphic dual to v as

v (u) = {u. : u  v , holomorphic :

that is uz1,...zn (v) holomorphic v  v } .

(23)

the meromorphic test-functions naturally extends to u, ie. they have poles only when their
argument coincides with one of the zi-s, {z1, . . . , zn }  u. this space is denoted by w 2(u).
the space of the conformal blocks associated to the open set u and the representation v can
be dened as those elements of the holomorphic dual which satisfy the ward identities:

e(u) = nu  v (u)| u(xv) = 0

;

v  v , x  w 2(u)o .

(24)

8

the space of the conformal blocks can be regarded as a holomorphic vector bundle over the
moduli space of the punctured sphere. the last thing we have to demand is that the operator
l1 to be the operator of the translation on the conformal blocks. this can be achieved
by dening a at connection on the space of the conformal blocks. we dene the covariant

dierentiation,  = pi zi  dzi, as

ziu(v) = ziu(v)  u(l(i)

1v).

(25)

for each v  v . from the fact that zi(ux) = (ziu)x + uzix for x  w 2(u) it follows, that
 maps the space e(u) into 1(u)  e(u), ie. it preserves the space of the conformal blocks.
we note that the connection is at:

[zi, zj ] = 0.

(26)

now the conformal blocks are dened to be those sections of e(u) which satisfy the horizon-
tality condition:

u = 0.

(27)

these equations in the kac-moody case are nothing but the famous knizhnik- zamolodchikov
equations, if we represent the virasoro algebra via the sugawara construction.

3 the wa2 theory

now let us try to apply the techincs introduced above for the simplest nontrivial w -theory,
namely for a theory having the wa2 algebra as the symmetry algebra. we dene the space of
the conformal blocks in analogy with the virasoro case. since the symmetry algebra contains
the virasoro algebra as a subalgebra the previous considerations can be adapted for this case.
the only new constraint we have to take into account comes from the ward identities of the
w (z) current, (5).

more precisely, consider the riemann sphere, , coordinatized by z and w = 1/z and
marked with n xed points, {zi}n
i=1. for each point we associate a h.w. representation of the
wa2 algebra and take the tensor product v = v1  . . .  vi  . . .  vn . we have the space of
functions w 2 as before, however now we dene an other space of functions w 3(\{p1, . . . pn})
 they correspond to the w -transformations  to be the space of complex valued meromorphic
functions, f (z), for which f (z)dz2 is holomorphic except the points p1, . . . , pn . (clearly the
globally dened w -transformations corresponds to the functions 1, z, z2, z3, z4).

now we associate to each function, f (z) of w 3( \ {p1, . . . pn}) an action of the w (z) eld
on v in the following way. make a taylor expansion for f (z) around the points zi and for the
(z zi)k+2 term associate the action of wk on vi thus the action of w (i)
n = 1. . .wn . . .1
on v . this map reads explicitly as:

where we have to make a dierence depending on whether n > 0 or n  0:

(29)

we note that the generators with tilde all annihilate the vacuum.

similarly to the virasoro case we dene the space of conformal blocks associated to the
points {z1, . . . , zn } and representation v as the space of linear functionals on v which is
annihilated by w 2 and w 3, (w for short):

e (v, {pi}) = {u  v  | u(xv) = 0

;

v  v , x  w} ,

(30)

in order to describe the h.w.

before dening the z-dependence of the conformal blocks, we analyze the dimension of
their space.
representation spaces, spanned by the ordered
monoms of the generators with negative indices, we introduce some subalgebras of the wa2
algebra. dene ws to be the subalgebra spanned by those negative modes that annihilate the
vacuum, ie.
it is generated by ws = {l1, w1, w2}. the other negative modes generate
another subalgebra which is denoted by w. now a general element of the verma modul vi
can be written as

vi = wi |ii = w j1

n1 . . . w jk

nkw i1

m1 . . . w il

ml|ii

; w jp  w , w ip  ws

(31)

where in the subalgebras dened above we choose the following ordering jl < jl+1 and if
jl = jl+1 then nl  nl+1, (i  j , n  m) and we introduced a compact notations for the
genartors: l = w 2 , w = w 3. the h.w. representation spaces, as in the virasoro case are
graded by the eigenvalue of l0.

similarly to the virasoro case it can be shown that the value of a conformal block on any
vector is determined by its value on the vectors generated by the generators of ws. the proof
is analogous to the virasoro case:
if one of the representations contains a mode from w
then by the aid of the dening relation of the conformal blocks we can express the value of
any conformal block in terms of its other values on lower level vectors only. we describe this
procedure in more detail in the general n-point case.

focusing on the two point functions the value of the conformal blocks has to be dened

on the vectors

v = (l1)i1(w2)i2(w1)i3|1i  (l1)j1(w2)j2(w1)j3|2i

(32)

besides the constraints coming form the global conformal transformation, (13), we have the
constraints of the global w -transformations:

they correspond to the element (zz1)n , n = 0 . . . 4 of w 3. clearly we have analogous but not
independent equations for (z  z2)n , n = 0 . . . 4. from the constraints (13) the mode l1 can

10

be eliminated. similarly, using the equations above the modes w1 and w2 can be removed
by the aid of the combinations w (1)

and 1  2, respectively. considering a linear combination of the last three equations which
does not contain any negative modes, we obtain

where w0|ii = wi|ii. this shows that the dimension of the space of the conformal blocks
is one if the virasoro weights coincide and the w -weights are opposite and in all other cases
it is zero.

now consider the n-point functions with insertion points z1, . . . , zn . the conformal block

u, by denition, assigns a complex number for each element of the form

v = w j1

n1 . . . w jk

(35)

where we used the ordering introduced earlier. now we will show that if v contain modes from
w than we can express the value of the conformal block with its values on vectors generated
by the modes of ws. without loss of generality we suppose that v = (w j)(i)
jnv  , n  0.
we use the denition of the conformal blocks, u(xv) = 0, for (z  zi)n1 and obtain u(v) =
jnv  = u(v ). clearly the level of v  is smaller than the level of v. proceeding
the same way we can eliminate all the modes of w and replace them with the modes of ws.
since during the procedure the level of the state in question is always decreasing and we are
working with h.w. representation spaces the procedure terminates.

in order to reduce further the space of conformal blocks we use the global w -transformations:

we determine the value of the conformal block u on the vector

v = (l1)i1(w2)i2(w1)i3|1i  . . .  (l1)j1(w2)j2(w1)j3|n i

(37)

proceeding the same way as we did in the case of the two point function, we take the dierence
of the 3
2zji multiple of the third equation and the fourth equation. this combination makes

11

it possible to eliminate the mode w (j)
2 at position j without increasing the level at position i.
similarly taking the dierence of the zij multiple of the third equation and the fourth equation
the mode w (j)
1 can be eliminated. using an analogous procedure the modes w1 and w2
can be eliminated at the position i and j simultaneously. now taking the combination

w (i)
2 + xj:j6=i

all in all this means that the value of the conformal blocks on any vector is determined if

it is given on the vectors:

v =

w j1

n1 . . . w jk

nk|1i  . . .  |ii  . . .

. . .  |ji  . . .  (w1)l|ki  . . .  w i1

m1 . . . w il

ml|n i

(39)

concretely in the case of the three point function the value of the conformal block u should
be knonw on the vector |1i|2i(w1)l |3i. there is an important dierence between the
purely virasoro symmetric theories and the theories having wa2 symmetry. in the second case
the space of the three point functions is innite dimensional. (we note that the independence
of the |1i  |2i  |3i three point function from |1i  |2i  w1|3i can be seen even in
the simplest minimal model).

, so we keep the equation (38) for dening w (1)

in the three point case, as in the virasoro theory, we can analyze the possible nonvanishing
couplings. we leave the operator w (1)
undetermined and eliminate the negative modes in
the rst two representations. contrary to the previous case we cannot use the equation
which contains w (1)
. this shows that in
the third representation space everything, which is generated by the elements of ws remains
if however, we have singular vectors which makes this
undetermined in the general case.
space nite then we have a nite dimensional matrix for w (1)
, whose eigenvalues give the
nonvanishing couplings. this matrix has a simple form if we take the limit z1  , z2  1
and z3  0. in this case the constraints, which annihalate the conformal blocks on the right,
are:

they can be used to analyze the fusion a la feigin and fuchs. this was performed by watts,
see [19] for the details.

we investigate the possible couplings, similarly as we did in the virasoro case, by start-
ing with the simplest cases. consider the representation space where the factorspace vs :=
wsv/wv is one dimensional. this is the vacuum representation with two singular vectors
at level one which can be chosen as l1|3i = w1|3i = 0. we also have the descendant
singular vector w2|3i = 0 which shows that the special subspace is one dimensional. this
implies that the analysis of the three point function reduces to the analysis of the two point
functions as in the virasoro case.

12

in the next simplest case we have a singular vector at level one and another one at level
two. this corresponds to the toda model [21]. in order to describe this representation space
we parametrize the central charge of the wa2 algebra as

c = 2  24(  1)2.

(41)

now in this completely degenerate representation space we have a h.w. singular vector at
level one

we also have a combination of the h.w. singular vector at level two and a descendats of the
h.w. singular vector above, which has a very simple form

(cid:16)w1  (5/6 + 1/21)l1(cid:17) |ui = 0.

(42)

(43)

(44)

(cid:16)w2  1l2

1 + 2/3l2(cid:17) |ui = 0.

moreover we have the toda equation of motion which is a descendant singular vector at level
three:

(cid:16)w3  3l3

1 + 1l1l2 + (/6  1/21)l3(cid:17) |ui = 0.

this shows that the special subspace in question is three dimensional.

for each pair of the h.w. representations of the sl3 algebra labelled by the highest weights
(n1, n2) = n11 + n22 , n  m, (where 1, 2 denote the fundamental weights), a h.w.
representation of the wa2 algebra can be associated via the following formulae:

h =

1
3

(x2

1 + x1x2 + x2

2)  (  1)2

w =

1
27

(x1  x2)(2x1 + x2)(x1 + 2x2),

(45)

where xi = (ni + 1)  (mi + 1)1 =: (ni, mi). the vacuum corresponds to the trivial
representation, x1 = (0, 0), x2 = (0, 0), and the toda eld to the fundamental representation
x1 = (1, 0) and x2 = (0, 0). note that the dimension of the special subspace is the same as
the dimension of the sl3 representation. (this correspondence is much more straightforward
at the classical level). now if the parameters of the second representations are (n1, n2) then
the three possible eigenvalues of the operators l(1)
correspond to the parameters
0
(n1 + 1, n2  1), (n1  1, n2) and (n1, n2  1), respectively, [21], (where the m values are
unchanged). this is very similar to the fusion rules of the fundamental representation of sl3.
the z-dependence of the conformal blocks are dened in the same way as in the vira-
soro case, the only novelty is that the meromorphic testfunctions corresponding to the w -
transformations have to extended to the neighbourhood u. the horizontality condition gives
dierential equations for the conformal blocks, which can be solved in the simplest case, for
details see [21].

and w (1)

4 the case of general w -algebras

we now follow the previous line and generalise the results obtained to other w -algebras. let
 denote the riemann sphere with coordinates z and w = 1/z and v = v1  v2  . . .  vn the
product of the highest weight representations, vi, of the chiral algebra associated to the point

13

pi. the chiral algebra is supposed to be a w -algebra with integer spin elds only. introduce
the space of complex valued functions on the riemann sphere, w j( \ {p1, . . . pn}), for whose
elements, f (z), f (z)dzj+1, are holomorphic except the points p1, . . . , pn. the globally dened
transformations correspond to the functions 1, z, . . . , z2j2. for each functions of this type we
associate an action of the spin j generator of the chiral algebra on v in the following way:
we laurent expand f (z) around zi and for the term (z  zi)k+j1 we associate the action of
w j
n  . . .  1 on v . since the functions of w j
are of the form (z  zi)n , n < 2j  1 we give the action explicitly for them:

k on vi thus the action of (w j)(i)

k = 1  . . .  w j

(47)

w (l)

nj+1 = 


(1)np
(1)npn

as in the previous cases the generators with tilde contain modes only which annihilate the
vacuum.

now having set the stage we dene the space of the conformal blocks associated to the
representation v and the points p1, . . . , pn , as the space of linear functionals on v which are
annihilated by w, the collection of the w j-s:

e (v, {pi}) = {u  v | u(xv) = 0

;

v  v , x  w}.

(48)

as a rst step we determine the dimension of the space of the conformal blocks. we
introduce a basis in the h.w. representation, vi of the w -algebra. by denition vi = u(w)vi,
where w contains the negative modes of the generating elds. we devide the negative modes
of the w -algebra into two groops depending on whether they annihilate the vacuum or not.

ws = nw j

n|

j > n > 0o

; w = nw j

n| n  jo .

(49)

clearly the vacuum module is u(w)|0i. the elements of ws generate global transforma-
tions. the verma modules can be described as vi = u(w)u(ws)vi, where in the subal-
gebras the generators are ordered in such a way that the generators with smaller spins stay
before the highers or in the case of the same spins the more negative preceeds the others. as
before we will show that the value of the conformal block u on every vector v of v is completely
determined by its value on the vectors generated by the elements of ws. this means that we
have to give the value of u on the tensor products, vs, of the vectors, (vi)s = u(ws)vi. the
proof is inductive in the level dened on the verma module in the usual way: the level of a
vectors in v is simply the sum of its levels in vi. clearly at the lowest grades we have the
elements of vs. now suppose that we have a vector v not in vs, without loss of generaltily it
has the following form:

v = w j1

n1 . . . w jr

nrv1  . . .  w i1

m1 . . . w ip

mpvi  . . .  w k1

l1 . . . w ks

ls vn = (w i1)(i)

m1v



(50)

14

where m1  i1. no we use the denition of the conformal blocks u(xv) = 0 for the element
m1, which correspond to the function (z  zi)m1+i11  w i1 and
x = (w i1)(i)
obtain

m1 + pj:j6=i( w i1)(j)



)

(51)

u(v) = u(cid:16)xj:j6=i

( w i1)(j)
m1v

(cid:17) = u(v

since the level of v  is smaller than the level of v the statement is proved.

now we turn to the two point functions. the constraints coming from the global transfor-

mations with test functions (z  z1)n , n = 0, 1, . . . 2j  2 for the spin j generators are:

u(cid:16)(w (1)

now consider the last j equations. descarding the last one for a while the others contain the
negative modes linearly independently due to the binomial nature of the coecients. as a
consequence we can nd such a combinations of these equations which contain the negative
mode w (2)
i can be
eliminated. doing the same procedure for the other generators we arrive at the h.w. vector.
clearly using the 1  2 trick, only the h.w. vectors remain in both representations spaces.
now using also the last equation we get:

i only and nothing else. applying this equations recursively the mode w (2)

this shows that the dimension of the space of the conformal blocks is one if the eigenvalue
of the even generators are the same and the odd generators are opposite and in every other
cases it is zero.

now consider the n point functions. clearly it is enough to take into account the value of
the conformal blocks on the vectors generated by the elements of ws. the constraints from
the global transformations are:

where we did not write out explicitly the spin of the generator. now taking the same linear
combination of the equations which we saw at the two point case we can eliminate the negative
modes of w (l)
n without increasing the level at the position i and l. doing so reductively all
negative modes at l can be eliminated. clearly we can do the same for i. moreover with
the aid of the last equation the mode w (k)
j+1 of the spin j generator at position k can be
reexpressed by others. this means that the correlation function should be dened on the
vectors of the form:

v = w j1

n1 . . . w jr

nr  . . . |vii  . . .  w i1

m1 . . . w ip

mp|vki  . . .  |vji  w k1

l1 . . . . . .  w ks

ls |vn i (55)

where is + 1 < ms < 0. concretely in the three point case this means that we have to dene
the conformal bloks on the vectors:

v = |v1i  |v2i  w k1

l1 . . . w ks

ls |v3i

; li < ki

(56)

which means that the symmetry does not x the three point functions completely as it is xed
in the virasoro case.

turning to the completely degenerete representation we can express w (1)

as an operator
which contain negative modes only in the third representation, moreover only the modes of
ws. this shows that the number of possible couplings is bounded by the dimension of the
factorspace vs = ws|3i/w|3i which was called the special subspace by nahm. he also
obtained the same result considering the fusion of a eld with nite dimensional subspace [18].
one feasible way to characterise the w -algebras can be achieved by analysing their special
subspaces. the simplest representation space is always the vacuum representation which
contains the same number of singular vectors as the number of the generating elds of the
w -algebra in question. these singular vectors are independent so they can be chosen in the
following form: w j
1v = 0 for all the generating primary elds. the primary nature of the
elds yields that we have descendant singular vectors of the spin j generator of the form
adlk
k1v = 0 , k = 1, . . . , j  2. these show that the dimension of the special
subspace is one and accordingly the analysis of the three point function reduces to the analyses
of the two point function.

in the next simplest representation we have one singular vector at level two and all the
others at level one. we believe that this representation characterizes the w -algebra as fun-
damentaly as the vacuum representation. as the vacuum representation is the trivial repre-
sentation in the quantum case the next simplest should be the fundamental representation at
the quantum level. this is where the special subspace have the smallest nontrivial dimension
and consequently the number of elds that appear in the fusion product is the smallest. that

16

is why we call this representation the quantum fundamental representation, since it shares
this property with the fundamental representation of lie algebras. (the importance of this
representation was also observed by hornfeck [17]).

this connection is explicit in the case of the wg algebras: one possible way to quantize
the toda theories is to quantise their equation of motions, [21, 22]. in this language the special
subspace has the same dimension as it has in the classical case which we analyse in the next
section.

the z-dependence of the correlation functions can be described very similarly to the vi-

rasoro case. take a point in the conguration space cn = n{z1, . . . zn }  n , zi 6= zjo and

for its neighbourhood, u, associate a holomorphic dual to v as

v (u) = {u. : u  v , holomorphic :

that is uz1,...zn (v) holomorphic v  v } .

(57)

extend the meromorphic test-functions corresponding to the w -transformation of the spin j
generator to u and denote this space by w j(u). the space of the conformal blocks associated
to the open set u and the representation v are dened to be those elements of the holomorphic
dual which satisfy the ward identities:

e(u) = {u  v (u)| u(xv) = 0

;

v  v , x  w(u)} .

(58)

(here w(u) denotes the collection of the w j(u)-s). similarly to the virasoro case the space
of the conformal blocks can be regarded as a holomorphic vector bundle over the moduli
space of the punctured sphere. the z-dependence is dened by the aid of a at connection:

 = pi zi  dzi, where

ziu(v) = ziu(v)  u(l(i)

1v).

(59)

for each v  v . since zi(ux) = (ziu)x + uzix for x  w(u) it maps the space e(u) into
1(u)  e(u), ie. it preserves the space of the conformal blocks. now the conformal blocks
are dened to be those sections of e(u) which satisfy the horizontality condition:

u = 0.

(60)

5 classical toda theory and singular vectors

the classical w -algebras corresponding to the principal sl2 embedding were dened in [2, 3].
they are nothing but the symmetry algebras of the toda models, the theories that arises as
reductions of the wess-zumino-witten-models. now we summarize the results we need. one
imposes rst class constraints on the space of the kac-moody currents. the w -algebra is
the gauge invariant part of the constrained phase space, ie.
it is invariant under the gauge
transformations generated by the constraints. the dening relations of the w -algebra are
given by the dirac brackets, and can be calculated very easily, which is one consequence of
the reduction procedure. more concretely the w -transformations can be implemented by an
appropiately chosen, km transformation, jimp(w i):

jf ix(w i(y)) = z dxi(x){w i(x), jf ix(w i(y))} = [jimp(y), jf ix(w i(y))] + jimp(y).

(61)

17

the current, jimp(w i), also denes an action of the w -algebra on the group element of the
wznw model as g(x+) = jimp(x+)g(x+), where this space is constrained as +g = jf ixg.
all information on a given classical w -algebra are contained in the matrices jf ix and jimp.

concentrating on the virasoro case we have for the fundamental representation the fol-

lowing results:

jf ix =   0 l(x)

0 ! = t + l(x)t+

for the gauge xed current and

jimp =   1

.

(62)

(63)

(64)

considering the classical representation space we have to solve the equation jf ix(x)g(x) =
g(x). concentrating on the columns we have

  0 l(x)

0 !  u1(x)

u0(x) ! =   u1(x)
u0(x) !

in detail it reads as

u1(x) = u0(x)



;



u0(x)

 l(x)u0(x) = 0

(65)

(66)

the action of the w -transformation on the representation space described above is dened as
g(x) = jimp(x)g(x), ie.

u0(x) = (x)u0(x)





1
2



(x)

u0(x),

(67)

this means, that classically u0 is a hw. primary eld with weight  1
2 and the equation (66) can
be considered as a classical singular vector at level two. this has a very simimilar structure
as the quantum singular vector of the quantum dening representation.

in the case of the wa2 algebra starting from the fundamental representation of sl3 the

gauge xed current reads as

jf ix = 


0 l(x) w (x)

l(x)

= t + l(x)t+ + w (x)l++ = t + w 2(x)t+ + w 3(x)l++.

we can read o that it is a virasoro and a w -primary eld, moreover it corresponds to a
completely degenerate representation, since we have two independent classical singular vectors
{w1, u0} = 1
3 lu0. clearly they have the same structure we had in
the quantum case. we expect that this structure naturally generates for other represenations of
the classical algebra. (see the appendix for one example). in the general case the +g = jf ixg
relation shows that the classical special subspace has the same dimension as the dimension of
the representaion of the underlying algebra.

6 conclusion

we dened the space of the conformal blocks for a general w -algebra as the space of those
linear functionals on the product of the representation spaces that is annihilated by certain
meromorphic w -transformations. in determining the dimension of this space we observed the
importance of a special subspace of the h.w. representation spaces. this space is a factorspace
spanned by those negative modes of the w -algebra that annihilate the vacuum modulo those

19

that do not. analysing the three point functions of a eld  with nite dimensional special
subspace  and any xed h.w. primary eld, the number of the elds that can have nonzero
three point functions is bounded by the dimension of the special subspace. this number is
supposed to be nite for all the soluble models. we can charecterize the w -algebras by their
special subspaces. for the simplest module, the vacuum module, the special subspace is one
dimensional. we called the next simplest representation space, a representation where the
dimension of the special subspace takes the smallest nontrivial values, the quantum funda-
mental representation since in the case of the wg algebras this is the quantum analogue of
the fundamental representation of g. this is supported by the dimension of the special sub-
space and by the fusion of this eld, moreover can be corroborated by exploiting the relation
between the classical and quantum toda models. a further elaboration of this relationship
and the analysis of the geometry of the conformal blocks is work in progress.

7 appendix

the wbc2 algebra, which is generated by the energy momentum tenzor w2 and a spin
four current w4, is one of the simplest w -algebras [13, 15, 16]. the singular vectors in the
quantum dening representation are very simple, see [22] for the details. we have a h.w.
singular vector at level one

w1|ui + 1l1|ui = 0

(75)

combining the h.w.
singular vector above we have a singular vector at level two of the form:

singular vector of level two with one of the descendants of the h.w.

w2|ui + 2l2|ui + 11l2

1|ui = 0.

they have a descendant at level three which has a particularly nice form

w3|ui + 3l3|ui + 12l1l2|ui + 111l3

1|ui = 0.

(76)

(77)

among the descendants at level four we can nd the quantum equation of motion of the c2
toda model:

w4|ui + 4l4|ui + 22l2
+13l1l3|ui + 112l2

2|ui +

1l2|ui + 1111l4

1|ui = 0.

(78)

this shows that the dimension of the special subspace is four dimensional in this case. if we
had considered the b2 toda model instead of the c2 then we would have obtained analogous
singular vectors at the rst three levels. the singular vector at level four in the form above is
missing, however we have a singular vector at level ve in the form:

14l1l4u  2

(+1)

l1w4u + w5u + 122l1l2

2u + 113l2

1l3u

+ 1112l3

1l2u + 11111l5

1u + 23l2l3u + 5l5u = 0.

(79)

20

it is in aggrement with the fact that the dimension of the fundamental representation of c2
is four and the b2 is ve. the fusion of these elds follow the selection rules of the four and
ve dimensional representations of the underlying algebra. see [23] for the details.

it is interesting to compare this quantum representations to the classical ones.

in the
simplest case, which corresponds to the dening representation of the c2 algebra, the form of
the constrained current is

jf ix =
