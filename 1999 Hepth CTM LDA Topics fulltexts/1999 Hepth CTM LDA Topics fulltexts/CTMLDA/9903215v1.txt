abstract

we study mass deformations of n = 2 superconformal eld theories with ade global
symmetries on a d3-brane. the n = 2 seiberg-witten curves with ade symmetries
are determined by the type iib 7-brane backgrounds which are probed by a d3-brane.
the seiberg-witten dierentials  for these ade theories are constructed. we show
that the poles of  with residues are located on the global sections of the bundle in an
elliptic bration.
it is then clearly seen how the residues transform in an irreducible
representation of the ade groups. the explicit form of  depends on the choice of a
representation of the residues. nevertheless the physics results are identical irrespective
of the representation of . this is considered as the global symmetry version of the
universality found in n = 2 yang-mills theory with local ade gauge symmetries.

1 introduction

probing the 7-brane background of type iib compactication on p1 by a d3-brane pro-

vides a powerful machinery to analyze the non-perturbative behavior of four-dimensional

n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories [1, 2]. in this setup, the space-time gauge symme-

try is transmuted into the global symmetry in the world volume n = 2 supersymmetric

gauge theory on a d3-brane. then it is found in [3] that there exist non-trivial n = 2

superconformal xed points with exceptional global symmetries. in [4, 5], on the other

hand, n = 2 xed points with en global symmetries are considered as a natural extension

of foregoing works [6, 7, 8, 9].

although the n = 2 theory with exceptional symmetry does not admit the lagrangian

description, recent advances in string duality have made it possible to study the strong-

coupling regime of n = 2 theory by the stringy technique. for instance, it requires a

considerable amount of eort in general to analyze the properties of the bps spectrum of

n = 2 theory. the junction picture of bps states, however, gives the simple constraint on

the bps spectrum [10, 11]. with the use of this constraint, some characteristic features

of the bps states in n = 2 theory with en symmetries are revealed [11].

in this paper we study mass deformations of n = 2 theories with ade global sym-

metries in detail. the present work is partly motivated in our attempt to get a clearer

understanding of the results obtained by minahan and nemeschansky [4, 5] in formulating

the elliptic curves and the seiberg-witten (sw) dierentials for en theories. it was found

in [5] that, for a given elliptic curve, the sw dierential  is not uniquely determined, but

depends on the representations (fundamental or adjoint) of the global symmetry group.

it is then argued that  in dierent representations lead to dierent physics.

in our approach we proceed along the line of the d3-brane probe picture and discuss

systematically the curves and the dierentials for the ade theories.

in particular we

clarify a great deal the properties of the pole terms of the sw dierential. even for the
case of n = 2 su(2) qcd with nf  3, which is thought to be well understood, we gain
a new insight. consequently we are able to show that the representations of the ade

groups from which the sw dierential is built are irrelevant to the physics results. in this

regard, our conclusion is opposed to what is argued in [5].

1

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we see that the elliptic curves for n = 2

ade theories on a d3-brane are naturally identied by examining the local geometry of
singularities in the compactication of type iib theory on p1 with the 24 background

7-branes. in section 3 the bps mass formula for n = 2 ade theories is discussed in

the light of the string junction lattice. in section 4 the residues of the poles of the sw

dierentials for our ade theories are shown to transform in an irreducible representation

of the global symmetry groups. this aords a rm foundation of somewhat empirical

construction of the sw dierentials in [6, 4, 5]. in section 5 the sw dierentials in the

fundamental as well as the adjoint representations are obtained in the a1, a2, d4, e6, e7

and e8 theories. in section 6 we analyze in detail how the sw dierential behaves under

the renormalization group ow from the e6 theory to the d4 theory. in section 7 it is

proved that the sw periods are independent of the representations of the global symmetry

which are chosen to construct the sw dierential. the result in section 7 is conrmed in
section 8 by further studying n = 2 su(2) qcd with nf  3. finally we conclude in
section 9.

2 d3-brane probe and elliptic curves

when type iib theory is compactied on p1 with the 24 background 7-branes, the string
coupling constant  = +ie, where  is a r-r scalar eld and  a dilaton, is determined

as the modular parameter of an elliptic curve [12]

y2 = x3 + f (z)x + g(z).

(2.1)

here z is a complex coordinate on p1, f and g are polynomials in z of degree 8 and 12,
respectively. the 24 zeroes of the discriminant  = 4f 3+27g2 are the transverse positions
of the 24 7-branes. the modular parameter  is obtained from j( ) = 4(24f )3/. the
cubic (2.1) describes a k3 surface as an elliptic bration over the base p1. when the

positions of some 7-branes coincide the elliptic bration develops singularities which are

well-known to follow the kodaira classication [13]. the singularity types then have a

correspondence with the ade singularities, according to which the ade types of gauge

symmetry in type iib theory are identied [1, 14].

table 1: symmetry and background 7-branes

the connection between the ade gauge symmetry and the background 7-brane con-

gurations has been established by analyzing the monodromy properties [15, 16]. in type

iib theory there exist 7-branes which are mutually nonlocal. to distinguish them we shall

refer to a 7-brane on which type iib (p, q) strings can end as a [p, q] 7-brane. for the
purpose of describing the ade symmetry it is sucient to take into account [1, 0], [1,1]
and [1, 1] 7-branes which will be henceforth denoted as a-, b- and c-branes, respectively.
let anbmc represent a set of n a-, m b- and  c-branes. the e8 gauge symmetry, for
instance, is realized at  = e2i/3 when a set of 7-branes a7bc2 coalesces. gauge symme-

tries and the corresponding 7-brane congurations relevant to our following discussions
are summarized in table 1. we note that e5 = d5 and the brane conguration a4bc2
is shown to be equivalent to a5bc [17].

we now introduce a d3-brane which is parallel to the background 7-branes. this d3-

brane can probe the local geometry near the singularities which are responsible for the

gauge symmetry enhancement. on the d3-brane the low-energy eective theory becomes

four-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory. suppose that the d3-brane probe

is located near coalescing 7-branes, then n = 2 theory on the d3-brane is a xed point

theory since there are no relevant mass parameters turned on. the gauge symmetry in the

bulk turns out to be the enhanced global symmetry of a xed-point n = 2 supersymmetric

theory on the brane [2].

from this point of view, let us look at table 1. first of all, the d4 theory on the

3

brane in the vicinity of the 7-branes a4bc arises in n = 2 su(2) theory with nf = 4
fundamental quarks [6]. here b- and c-branes stand for monopole and dyon singularities,

and a-branes stand for the squark singularities in the coulomb branch. the n = 2 su(2)

theory with nf = 4 is nite and the marginal gauge coupling constant can take any values.
similarly, the a2, a1 and {0} theories also arise in the coulomb branch of n = 2 su(2)
theory with nf = 3, 2 and 1, respectively. these are non-trivial superconformal theories

obtained by adjusting quark masses at particular values [8]. on the other hand, the d5

theory describes the ir free behavior of n = 2 su(2) theory with nf = 5. the most

interesting are the theories with en (n = 6, 7, 8) global symmetries. they are non-trivial

n = 2 superconformal eld theories, but do not admit the lagrangian description. in

view of the d3-brane probe approach, it is natural to place these non-trivial xed points

with exceptional symmetry in the sequence of renormalization group ows

(2.2)

where 7-branes indicated under the arrows are sent to innity to generate the ows. in

(2.2) only the d4 theory is described as a local lagrangian eld theory, while the others
are considered to be non-local. note that the ows e6  d4 and d4  a2 are realized
by moving away mutually non-local 7-branes simultaneously.

starting with the d4 theory one can also consider more familiar ows

(2.3)

where the 7-brane background for the dn symmetry is given by anbc. note that, for
n  3, the conguration anbc does not fall into the kodaira classication since it is
non-collapsible [17]. on a d3-brane probing anbc with n  3, ordinary n = 2 su(2)
qcd with nf = n fundamental quarks is realized.

as mentioned previously, enhanced global symmetries at the xed points in (2.2) are

recognized in geometric terms as the ade singularities. thus relevant perturbations

taking the system away from criticality are described in terms of versal deformations of

the ade singularities. the coupling constant  of deformed n = 2 theories is then

determined by elliptic curves in the form of (2.1) where the explicit forms of polynomials

g = z4 + w6z2 + w9z + w12,

f = z2 + ew4,

f = w2,

f = z,

g = w2z2 + w4z + w6,

g = z2 + w3,

g = w2,

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

where the wq are deformation parameters. here z is understood as the gauge invariant

expectation value which parametrizes the vacuum moduli of n = 2 theory. in the brane
picture z is a coordinate of the position of the d3-brane probe on p1. in the cubic (2.1)
with (2.4)-(2.9) we take y2 to be of degree h with h being the coxeter number of g = ade

(see table 2). then x, y, z have the degree qx, qy, qz as given in table 2 and wqi has the

degree qi = ei + 1 where ei is the i-th exponent of g. note here that qx + qz = qy + 1 and

2qy = h. the value of qz gives the scaling dimension of the expectation value z [8, 4].

notice that only in the d4 theory the coupling constant  is marginal, and hence the

curve may incorporate the  -dependence. this is allowed since x and z have the same

degree qx = qz = 2 which holds only for the d4 case. in fact the seiberg-witten (sw)

curve for the d4 theory obtained originally in [6] depends on both  and four bare quark

masses m1, m2, m3, m4. it is not dicult to work out how the sw curve in [6] is related

to our d4 curve (2.7). let us write down the sw curve presented in (17.58), section 17

of [6]

y 2 = x(x  z)(x  z) + ax 2 + bx + cz + d,

(2.10)

where we have used z instead of u to denote the adjoint higgs expectation value and

b = (  )2u4/4 + i(2  2)eu4/4,

(2.12)

making a change of variables

x = x,

y = (  )y/2,

z = i(  )z/2  ( + )x/2,

(2.13)

we see that (2.10) becomes

y2 = xz2 + x3 + u2x2 + u4x +eu4z + u6

(2.14)

which is nothing but the standard form of deformations of the d4 singularity. we next
replace x by x  u2/3 and shue the d4 invariants as

u2 = 3w2,
u6 = w6  w2ew4  w3

u4 = ew4 + 3w2

eu4 = w4.

then we obtain the d4 curve with (2.7).

(2.15)

in writing (2.10) we have replaced ma by ma/2 in (17.58) of [6]. this is necessary to agree with

section 16 of [6]. see section 17.4 of [6].

3 bps mass formula

having obtained the sw curve for n = 2 theory on a d3-brane probe, we next discuss

the bps mass formula. in the brane probe approach, bps states on the d3-brane world

volume are geometrically realized as type iib strings, or more generally string junctions

obeying the bps condition. according to [18], junctions are specied by asymptotic

charges (p, q) and a weight vector of g = ade. denoting a junction as j we have [18]

j = p

p + q

q +

rank gxi=1

aii,

(3.1)

where p and q are junctions which are singlets under g with asymptotic charges (1, 0)

and (0, 1) respectively, and the i with zero asymptotic charges are junctions correspond-

ing to the fundamental weights of g. here the ai are the dynkin labels representing a

weight vector. the bps condition on j is described as [10, 11]

(j.j)  gcd(p, q)  2,

(3.2)

where ( . ) stands for the bilinear form on the junction lattice [18].

the bps junction with (p, q) charges can end on the d3-brane and realizes the bps

state with electric p and magnetic q charges in the world volume n = 2 theory. sen has

rst gured out this and, furthermore, shown how the sw bps mass formula in the d4

theory is obtained from the mass formula for a (p, q) string in type iib theory [19]. his

proof is easily extended to the general ade case. for this, let us recapitulate the basic

elements in the sw theory [20, 6]. the sw dierential  associated with an elliptic curve

has to obey


z

= 

dx
y

+ d()

with a normalization constant . the sw periods are then given by

a(z) =i

,

ad(z) =i

,

(3.3)

(3.4)

where  and  are two homology cycles on a torus. the n = 2 central charge for a bps

state with charges (p, q) reads

z = pa(z) + qad(z) +

1

2xa

sama,

7

(3.5)

where the ma are the bare mass parameters and the sa are the global abelian charges.

the bps mass is then given by

m = 2|z|.

(3.6)

let us now recall the standard elliptic function formula for the discriminant of the

cubic

(z) = 220(cid:18) 

21(cid:19)12

( )24,

where ( ) is the dedekind eta function and 21 is the period along the -cycle

we thus verify the crucial formula from (3.7) that

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

in type iib theory on p1, on the other hand, the mass of a (p, q) string stretched

along a path c is given by

mp,q =zc

tp,qds,

where the tension of a (p, q) string reads

tp,q =

im  |p + q|

and the line element is given in terms of the metric

.

ds2 = im (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)( )2(z) 1
12 dz(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

is obtained by choosing a curve c so that c is a geodesic.

a bps state with a mass mbps
p,q
then, following [19], one can show mbps

p,q  m with the aid of (3.9).

the bps junctions are lifted to holomorphic curves in f/m theory compactied on

an elliptically bered k3 surface. from this viewpoint, it is interesting to see that the

expression (3.1) of a junction looks quite similar in form to the central charge (3.5). we
may think of the  and  cycles as the projection of the p and q junctions on the x-

plane. it is obscure, however, how to understand the bare mass term in (3.5) in the light

of the third term of (3.1) which consists of the junctions associated to the fundamental

8

weights. in fact there is an important subtlety here. in massive theory, the global abelian

charges sa in (3.5) carry only constant parts of the physical abelian charges [21]. the

periods a, ad can also produce terms of constants multiple of bare masses [21, 22]. these

terms can arise in the period integrals in massive theory since the sw dierential has the

poles with residues proportional to bare masses [23]. in other words, to determine the

abelian charges appearing explicitly in the n = 2 central charge, one has to analyze the

meromorphic properties of the sw dierential carefully.

4 residues of the seiberg-witten dierential

in this section our purpose is to discuss some general properties of the sw dierential

 associated to our ade elliptic curves with (2.4)-(2.9) for the mass deformed ade

theories. the dierential  satises (3.3) where a normalization constant  will be xed

later on. in order to nd  we rst follow section 17.1 of [6]. let x be a complex surface
dened by y2 = w (x, z; wi) as in (2.4)-(2.9). a holomorphic two-form  on the surface
reads

 = 

.

(4.1)

dx  dz

y

we wish to rewrite the condition (3.3) in terms of . to do so, note that, for  = a(x, z)dx,

(3.3) is written as



dx
y

=

a(x, z)

z

dx +

f (x, z)

x

dx,

(4.2)

where f (x, z) has appeared from the total derivative term in (3.3). dene a one-form

e = a(x, z)dx + f (x, z)dz, then (3.3) is succinctly written as

 = de.

(4.3)

this means that there exists a smooth dierential e obeying (4.3) if and only if the

cohomology h 2(x, c) is trivial.

suppose now that h 2(x, c) is non-trivial, and let the [ca] linearly span h 2(x, c).
the poincare dual of [ca], which is a complex curve, is a non-trivial homology cycle in

x. in this case, the relation (4.3) is modied to be

 = de  2ixa

resca(e)  [ca].

9

(4.4)

this describes the situation in which e has poles on the ca with residues resca(e) and

[ca] is a delta function supported on ca.

there is an important relation between the period integrals of  and the residues [6].

we may evaluate the periods

a =ica



(4.5)

upon compactifying x in an appropriate way. then the cohomology class [] is expanded

in terms of [ca] as

[] =xa,b

a(m1)ab[cb],

(4.6)

where mab = (ca  cb) is the intersection matrix which is invertible. expressing (4.4) in
cohomology and comparing to (4.6) one obtains [6]

resca(e) = 

1

2ixb

(m1)abb.

(4.7)

let us further examine the periods a. since the dening equation for x is y2 =

w (x, z; wi), the period integral (4.5) takes the form
dx  dz

a = ica

w (x, z; wi)1/2 .

(4.8)

we recall here that in the landau-ginzburg description of two-dimensional ade n = 2

superconformal eld theories, w (x, z; wi) is identied with the superpotential [24]. being

twisted, these theories turn out to be topological ones which can couple to topological

gravity. then, exactly the same periods as (4.8) have appeared when we calculate the

one-point functions in two-dimensional gravity [25]. it is shown there that the periods a

obey the gauss-manin dierential equation

  2
titj 

rxk=1

cij

k(t)

2

tktr! a(t) = 0,

(4.9)

where r = rank g (g = ade), ti (i = 1,   , r) are the at coordinates judiciously made of
k(t) are the three-point functions in the ade topological landau-ginzburg
the wi and cij
models. it is then clear from (4.7) that resca(e) satisfy (4.9).

to nd a class of solutions of the gauss-manin system (4.9), we introduce

p rg (t, ui) = det(t  r).

10

(4.10)

this is the characteristic polynomial in t of degree dimr where r is an irreducible
representation of g. here r is a representation matrix of r and ui (i = 1,   , r) is the
casimir built out of r whose degree equals ei + 1 with ei being the i-th exponent of g.
(4.10) may be solved formally with respect to the top casimir ur, yielding

if we dene

ur = fw rg (t, u1,   , ur1).

(4.11)

(4.12)

w rg (t, u1,   , ur) = fw rg (t, u1,   , ur1)  ur,

then w rg (t, ui) is the single-variable version of the landau-ginzburg superpotential which
gives rise to the same topological eld theory results with the standard ade topological

landau-ginzburg models equipped with the superpotential w (x, z; wi) independently of
the representations r [26, 27]. upon doing these computations one gures out how the
casimirs ui are related with the deformation parameters wi, and hence with the at

coordinates ti.

let ma (a = 1,   , dimr) be an eigenvalue of r, then (4.10) is written as

with

p rg (t, u1,   , ur) =

dimrya=1

(t  ma)

ma = (a, ),

where the a are the weights of r and ( , ) stands for the inner product. here

 =

ii

rxi=1

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

with i being the simple roots of g. expanding the rhss of (4.10) and (4.13) we see

how the casimirs ui are expressed in terms of i.

in [28], using the technique of topological landau-ginzburg models, it is shown that

the zeroes ma of the characteristic polynomial for any irreducible representation of the

ade groups satisfy the gauss-manin system (4.9) for the ade singularity. therefore

we are led to take

resca(e) = r ma(w),

11

a = 1,   , dimr,

(4.16)

where r is a normalization constant which may depend on r. the residues of the sw
dierential thus transform in the representation r of the global symmetry g.

having xed the residues we now would like to determine two-cycles ca on which the

poles are located. this is the issue to which we turn in the next section.

5 seiberg-witten dierential

in [4, 5] the sw dierentials in the cases of d4, e6, e7 and e8 have been constructed
by exploiting the idea of [6] that y2 in the cubic becomes a perfect square when x is at

the position of the pole. it was then found that one can obtain the sw dierentials for

the adjoint in addition to the fundamental of the global symmetry group. we wish to

demonstrate that the procedure can be formulated in a more transparent and systematic

way. for this purpose, it will be shown in this section that the complex curves ca on

which the sw dierential has poles are given by the global sections of the bundle in an

elliptic bration, and furthermore ca have one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible

representations of the global symmetry group g = ade. the relations among the global

sections in the elliptic bration, characteristic polynomials and algebraic equations have
been studied by shioda in his works on the theory of mordell-weil lattice [29].

let (xa(z), ya(z)) be such sections, then poles are located at x = xa(z) on the x-

plane. the residues of the poles are given by (4.16) where ma are the eigenvalues of a
representation matrix r. then, following minahan and nemeschansky [4, 5], we assume
the sw dierential in r to take the form

r = (c1z + c3b(w))

dx

+ c2xa

where b(w) = w2 for d4, w2
2 for e8 and 0 otherwise, and constants ci will be
determined up to the overall normalization in such a way that r obeys (3.3). note that
given the degree 1 to ma(w), r has the degree 1 which equals mass dimension of r.
since ma = (a, ) as in (4.14), the i are r (= rank g) independent mass parameters in

the theory.

one of us (sky) is indebted to k. oguiso for informing of shiodas works.

12

in the following we construct r explicitly for the a1, a2, d4 and en (n = 6, 7, 8)
theories. the a1 case is too simple to exhibit the essence of our calculations. so we start

with the case of a2 which is not only instructive but tractable by hand. in the d4 and

en theories we have used the maple software on computer to carry out our calculations.
the a1 result is given at the end of this section. a full detail of how to evaluate r/z
is presented in appendix a. the data of characteristic polynomials for d4, e6, e7 and

e8 is collected in appendix b.

5.1 the a2 theory

the a2 curve is written in terms of the coecient polynomials (2.8). as a section let us

assume

x = v,

y = z.

with v  c. substituting this into the a2 curve it is obvious that v has to satisfy

v3 + w2v + w3 = 0.

(5.2)

(5.3)

the lhs is in the form of the characteristic polynomial p 3
a2(t) for 3 of su(3) with two
casimirs w2 and w3 under the relation t  v. thus v is determined by the three zeroes
a2(t). let us set t = v/2, then we have the three roots va of (5.3) as va = 2ma
ma of p 3

and

w2 = v1v2 + v2v3 + v3v1 = 4(2
w3 = v1v2v3 = 812(1  2)

1 + 2

2  12),

(5.4)

with v1 + v2 + v3 = 0. putting v = va we observe that the section (5.2) belongs to 3 of

su(3).

it is quite interesting that the characteristic polynomial naturally appears when the
global sections are determined. accordingly the residues of the dierential r are xed
as was discussed before. we thus write down 3 in the form

there is no a priori reason for xing a constant c in the relation t = cv. our choice t = v/2 will be
justied in section 7 by considering the renormalization group ows from (or to) the d4 theory. this
remark also applies to the following cases studied in this section.

thus the six roots va of (5.10) are identied with the generically non-vanishing zeroes of

(5.11), i.e.

p 8

a2(va) = 0,

14

(5.12)

from which we see that the section (5.8) belongs to 8 of su(3).

for the adjoint section (5.8) the sw dierential is constructed as

8 = c1z

,

ma = va.

(5.13)

the non-zero weights of 8 read 1 = (1, 1), 2 = (1, 2) and 3 = (2,1)
in the dynkin basis. we have from (4.14) and (5.12) that va = (a, ). note that
va = va (a = 1, 2, 3) give the residues of the poles on the other sheet. in terms of this
parametrization, one can nd var1a explicitly from (5.9)

v1r11 = 3(1  2),

v2r12 = 31,

v3r13 = 32.

(5.14)

a0 and a1 in (a.16) are then evaluated to be

a1 = (2c1  9c2)w2,

a0 = 3c2z2 +

(2c1  9c2)w3.

to manipulate the z2 term in a0 we note

(5.17)

(5.18)

z2 = w 

which yields

thus

finally it should be mentioned that the elliptic bration (2.1) with (2.4)-(2.9) admits

the section in the form of (5.8) and, as we will see, (5.8) always corresponds to the adjoint

representation of g = ade.

5.2 the d4 theory

taking the curve (2.7) for the d4 theory we obtain the sw dierential in parallel with

the a2 case though the computations become slightly more involved. let us rst examine

the section in the form

( x(z) = z + r,

y(z) = vz + b.

15

(5.19)

(5.20)

(5.21)

for  = 0, plugging (5.19) in the d4 curve gives

v2  r  w2 = 0,

2vb  w4 = 0,

the elimination procedure results in

b2  r3  rew4  w6 = 0.

v8  3w2v6 +(cid:16)ew4 + 3w2

2(cid:17) v4 +(cid:16)w6  w2ew4  w3

2(cid:17) v2  w2

4/4 = 0.

this polynomial may be compared to the characteristic polynomial for 8v (vector) of

so(8)

then (5.21) is equivalent to

p 8v

d4 (t) = t8 + u2t6 + u4t4 + u6t2 eu2

4/4.

p 8v

d4 (va) = 0

(5.22)

(5.23)

under the relation (2.15), showing that the section with  = 0 is in the vector representa-

tion.

for  = i, on the other hand, we observe
d4(va/2) = 0,

p 8s

p 8c

d4(va/2) = 0,

for  = +i,

for  = i,

where the characteristic polynomial for 8s (spinor) of so(8) is given by

with  = i are in the spinorial representations.

(5.29)

for r = 8v, 8s and 8c.

as in the a2 theory, (5.8) gives the section in 28 (adjoint) of so(8). after bi and ri
are eliminated from the relations like (5.9), v is determined as the 24 non-zero roots va
(a = 1,   , 12) of

p 28
d4 (va) = 0.

(5.32)

finally we derive the dierential sw for the original sw curve (2.10) in the d4 theory.

for this let us rst take 8v and make a change of variables (2.13)

(5.33)

since

z  x,

(5.34)

one has to take care of the total derivative term in 8v/z (see (a.15)) when converting
8v into 8v

sw . the result reads

sw = c1 2z

that

according to the normalization adopted in [6].

5.3 the e6 theory

the global section which transforms in 27 of e6 is given by

( xa(z) = vaz + ba,

ya(z) = z2 + raz + sa

with a = 1,   , 27 [29]. in fact, the elimination procedure yields

p 27

e6 (va) = 0.

dx
y

dx
y

,

.

(5.36)

(5.37)

(5.38)

(5.39)

(5.40)

this reects the well-known fact in classical algebraic geometry that the cubic surface in
p3 contains exactly 27 lines [30].

the sw dierential associated with the 27 section is obtained as

27 = 36c2z

dx
y

+ c2

27xa=1

maya
x  xa

dx
y

,

ma = va,

(5.41)

where the poles with opposite residues on the other sheet transform in the 27 of e6. upon

taking the derivative one gets

27
z

= 12c2

dx
y

+ d().

(5.42)

18

in the e6 theory too, (5.8) yields the section in 78 (adjoint) of e6. we see that v

takes the values va (a = 1,   , 36) which correspond to the 72 non-zero roots of

p 78
e6 (2va) = 0.

(5.43)

assuming the sw dierential in the form

78 = c1z

+ c2

dx
y

,

ma = 2va,

(5.44)

maya
x  xa

36xa=1

we nd c1 = 0 and

78
z

as in the case of d4 the holomorphic piece is absent in 78 [5].

5.4 the e7 theory

the global section in 56 of e7 is obtained by taking [29]

( x(z) = cz + b,

y(z) = vz2 + rz + s.

(5.45)

(5.46)

(5.47)

we nd after the elimination process that v is determined from the 56 non-zero roots
2va (a = 1,   , 56) of

p 56
e7 (2va) = 0.

the sw dierential associated with the 56 section turns out to be

56 = 48c2(z + w2
2)

dx
y

+ c2

28xa=1

maya
x  xa

y

,

ma = 2va,

(5.48)

from which we get

56
z

= 12c2

dx
y

+ d().

(5.49)

the section given by (5.8) again corresponds to 133 (adjoint) of e7. we see that v

takes the values va (a = 1,   , 63) which yield the 126 non-zero roots of

p 133
e7 (2va) = 0.

(5.50)

we obtain the sw dierential as

133 = 18c2z

dx
y

and

133

ma = 2va,

5.5 the e8 theory

by counting degrees it is seen that there are no sections in the form of (5.39), (5.46).

this distinguishes the e8 case from e6 and e7, and corresponds to the fact that the

fundamental of e8 is identical with the adjoint. it is indeed proved by the elimination

procedure that the e8 curve possesses the section as in (5.8) which transforms in 248

of e8 [29]. as explained in [29], one can explicitly evaluate the resultant which appears
in the nal step of the elimination process. the result is that v takes the values va
(a = 1,   , 120) which give the 240 non-zero roots of

p 248
e8 (2va) = 0.

(5.53)

the sw dierential in 248 is then found to be

248 = 2c2(60z + w3

5.6 the a1 theory

it is clear that the a1 curve admits the section

x = 0,

y = v

(5.56)

which transforms in 2 of su(2) since v2  w2 = 0. the sw dierential in 2 is easily
obtained as

2 = c2(cid:18)z

x (cid:19) dx
y
where m1 = v1/2 = w2/2 and y1 = v1. thus we have

(5.62)

6 the scaling limit

according to the results in the previous section, it is inferred that one can always construct

the sw dierential  in the fundamental as well as adjoint representations in general ade
case. for d4, moreover, we have obtained d4
of so(8) which are permuted under the triality automorphism of d4. thus there arises a

8 for the vector, spinor and conjugate spinor

natural question whether the physics depends on representations chosen in constructing

the sw dierential. in order to study this problem it is important to analyze how the

sw dierential behaves under the renormalization group ow.

let us analyze in great detail how the e6 sw dierential reduces to the d4 sw

dierential when we move simultaneously a- and c-branes out to innity from the e6

seven brane background. when a a-brane is removed the e6 symmetry breaks down to
so(10)  u(1). the e6 mass parameters i are decomposed under the so(10)  u(1)
subgroup as

1 = 2m1 + b1,

2 = 4m1 + b2,

3 = 6m1 + b3,

4 = 5m1 + b4,

5 = 4m1,

6 = 3m1 + b5,

(6.1)

where the bi are the so(10) mass parameters and m1 is the u(1) mass [31]. here the

mass parameters are labeled as shown in the dynkin diagrams (see fig.1). removing

figure 1: dynkin diagrams

a c-brane induces the breaking of so(10) to so(8)  u(1). under so(8)  u(1) the
so(10) mass parameters are decomposed into the so(8) masses ci and u(1) mass m2 as

follows:

b1 = m2,

b2 = m2 + c1,

b3 = m2 + c2,

b4 = m2/2 + c3,

b5 = m2/2 + c4.

(6.2)

upon sending a- and c-branes together to innity we take the scaling limit [4]

m1, m2  ,

m1
m2

=

6(  )

xed,

(6.3)

where the limit mi   decouples two u(1) factors and the ratio with ,  dened in
(2.11) gives the value of the marginal gauge coupling constant in the d4 theory.

in order to see that the e6 curve reduces to the so(8) sw curve (2.10) we rst write

the e6 invariants wqi() in terms of so(8) masses ci

1 =

4 =

(6.4)

where m = 3m1/( + ) = m2/(2(  )) and the explicit expressions of wqi() in
terms of i are given in [32] . then making a change of variables

y = im 3y,
x = m 2(cid:18)x

a =

we next show explicitly that, in the limit (6.3), the e6 sw dierential e6

27 in 27 is

reduced to the sum of the d4 sw dierentials in 8v, 8s, 8c we have constructed previously.

this corresponds to the fact that the fundamental representation 27 of e6 is decomposed

under the so(8) subgroup into

27 = 8v  8s  8c  1  1  1.

(6.6)

let us put (6.4), (6.5) in the e6 dierential (5.41)

sw . in view of (6.6) and so(8) triality, on the one hand, (6.19)
sw is sucient to
describe the physics. note, however, that the location of poles and their residues depend

on 8v, 8s, 8c, and it is not so obvious if the irrelevance of which 8 of so(8) we choose

to construct the sw dierential is really due to triality invariance which is inherent in
so(8). in addition to this, the sw dierential e6

78 looks totally dierent from e6

27. this

is also the case in the d4 theory. in what follows we will study if the representation chosen

in constructing  is relevant to the physics or not.

22

(7.2)

(7.3)

with k27 = 6. notice that the index of 27 (or 27) is equal to 6. the appearance of the

index of representations is not peculiar to this case. for example, in (5.49) and (5.52) we
see 12 = (56) and 36 = (133), respectively, where (r) is the index of the representation
r (see table 3).

now examining the sw dierentials obtained for various instances in section 5 and

the renormalization group ows (see also [5, 6, 8]), we nd that the residue should be

normalized as

2iresx=xa(g
r

) =

22

,

ma = (a, ),

(7.4)

1
kr

where kr = (r), or kr = (r)/2 if the sum of the poles is taken over half of the (non-
zero) weights of r, and we use rsw for the d4 dierential. here the mass parameter
 is normalized so that we have mv
a = (a, ) in the d4 theory along the ows (2.2).
this explains why we need to be a little careful to x a numerical constant upon relating

ma and va in section 5. with this normalization of residues, it can be checked that the

two-form  in (4.1) is invariant under the successive ows (2.2). we also see that

g

z

= g

dx
y

,

26

(7.5)

where g is independent of r as read o from section 5.

we claim that (7.4) is the correct normalization of the residue. taking this for granted,
consider the renormalization group ow from the g theory to the g theory. in the g
theory, let the residues of the sw dierential transform in the representation r of g. if
the r branches to iri under g  g, the pole terms of g
reduce to the sum of pole
r
terms each of which transforms in ri of g. as observed in the ow e6  d4 we expect
that the pole terms belonging to non-singlets of g remain nite in the scaling limit which
implements the ow g  g. if this is assumed to be the case, we obtain

by matching the normalization of residues. this behavior is actually observed in (6.19).

7.1

irrelevance of representations

for a branching r = iri, we recall the identity (r) =pi (ri). then (7.6) may imply
are independent of ri. this may sound surprising, but
we now prove that the sw dierentials in any representation yield the identical physics

that the period integrals of g
r

i

result.

since g
r

periods if we specify the cycles, along which g

has the poles with nonzero residues, there is ambiguity in evaluating the
r is integrated, only in terms of the homology
class of the sw curve. thus we consider the sw curve as the torus with punctures at the
location of the poles of g
r. the homology class of this punctured torus has a basis , 
and a. here a goes around a pole at x = xa counterclockwise, and the cycles  and 

will be specied later.

given g

rj in the representation rj, we dene

arj (z, ) =i

g
rj ,

adrj (z, ) =z

g
rj

and

(7.7)

(7.8)

f (z, ) = ar1  ar2,

fd(z, ) = adr1  adr2.

this identity holds for the regular embedding since the embedding index is unity. every embedding

in the ows (2.2), (2.3) is regular.

27

it is an immediate consequence of (7.5) that f (z, m) = f (m) and fd(z, m) = fd(m).
when we loop around a singularity at z = zk on the z-plane, g
r

remains invariant but

the cycles undergo the monodromy

  n + m +xa
  n + m +xa

laa,

laa,

(7.9)

n m(cid:19) is conjugate to t = (cid:18) 1 1

where the matrix (cid:18) n m
0 1(cid:19) and l, l are some integers
which are non-zero when a cycle crosses a pole under a monodromy transformation. at
the singularity z = zk, therefore, we have a linear relation among arj , adrj and res(g
rj ).
this in turn gives rise to a linear relation for f (m), fd(m) and the residues. a similar

consideration at dierent singularity, say at z = zk, yields another linear relation. these

two relations are linearly independent when two 7-branes at z = zk and at z = zk are

mutually non-local. then we nd

f (m) =

2xj=1xaj

caj resx=xaj

(g

rj ),

fd(m) =

2xj=1xaj

caj resx=xaj

(g

rj ),

(7.10)

where caj , caj are some constants. hence we have shown that f (m) and fd(m) are linear
in ma.
in fact, if f (m) were not linear in ma, then for every z, we could have taken

1/f (m) = 0 in the codimension one subspace of the space of bare mass parameters. for a

generic value of z, however, f (m) may not be divergent, and hence f (m) should be linear

in m.

let us now apply a weyl transformations ma fma under which g

ri is left invariant.
the sw periods a(z, m) and ad(z, m), however, may exhibit a non-trivial behavior under
the weyl reection. this occurs if the weyl reection moves a pole of g
r on the x-plane
across the  and/or  cycles. the sw periods, on the other hand, should be weyl invariant

as gauge invariant expectation values. we thus prescribe that the positions of the cycles 

and  are xed relatively to the poles in such a way that the relative positions of the cycles

and the poles do not change under a weyl transformation. since it is always possible to
take such  and  in the asymptotic region z  ma of the moduli space, we henceforth
specify the cycles according to this prescription.k as a consequence of this, we see that

ksee [23] for an explicit example in the case of n = 2 su (2) qcd with nf = 2 massive quarks.

28

f (m) = f (fm) and fd(m) = fd(fm). remember here the fact that there are no weyl

invariants which are linear in ma, and hence we obtain f (m) = fd(m) = 0. therefore,

we conclude that the sw periods a, ad are independent of the choice of a representation
in constructing g

r as long as the cycles ,  are xed properly as described above.

7.2 numerical check

one can numerically evaluate the period integrals and check that a and ad are independent
of the representation r of the residues of g
r. in the case of a2 and d4, we express ar
and adr for r = f (undamental) and adj(oint) in terms of standard elliptic integrals by
taking two cycles ,  as we prescribed above. with the use of maple, we then obtain, for
example, af = 28.99673387 + 16.74790178 i and aadj = 28.99673386 + 16.74790178 i
in the a2 theory at z = 10, m1 = 1  0.2 i and m2 = 0.4 + 0.75 i. the error is
indeed extremely small compared to the ratio of z to mi. varying the values of mi

we plot in fig.2 the real and imaginary parts of af in the a2 theory for z = 10 and
m1 = 2x  0.2 i, m2 = 0.4 + 1.5 i x. computing the periods at various values of z and
mi, we have observed in both a2 and d4 theories that

af  aadj

af

< 108,

adf  adadj

adf

< 108,

(7.11)

where the dierentials (5.26), (5.31) have been utilized in the d4 theory. since the values

of a and ad change substantially as shown in fig.2 upon varying parameters of the moduli

space, we believe that the rhs of (7.11) are numerical errors and really mean zero.
to summarize, the sw periods will jump by a constant given by the residue of g

r if we
continuously deform the ,  cycles across a pole. namely, the dependence of the periods

on the cycles cannot be absorbed by the redenition of the periods among themselves.

furthermore, since the positions of the poles and their residues are solely determined
by the representation r chosen to construct g
r
relatively to the poles is a subtle issue. in spite of these, we have prescribed a way of

, how to x the location of the cycles

specifying the cycles, based on which the irrelevance of representations to the sw periods

is proved. to x the bps central charge, it remains to determine the constant piece of

the global abelian charges as mentioned in section 3. this will be possible once we locate

8 flows to n = 2 su (2) qcd with nf  3

it is well known that in n = 2 su(2) qcd with nf fundamental quarks, the global

symmetry is enhanced to so(2nf ) when the quarks are massless [6]. we now analyze

how the sw dierentials in the nf = 4 theory reduce to those in nf < 4 theories.

8.1 vector representation

let us rst take the nf = 4 sw dierential 8v
sw in the vector representation of so(8).
upon taking the scaling limit   1, +  2 and m4   with ()m4 = 3/4
xed [6], we obtain the nf = 3 theory. in this limit the d4 curve (2.10), which can be

rewritten as

thus, under these renormalization group ows, we obtain the sw dierentials in the

vector representation of so(2nf ).

we see from the above that the residues of 2nv

dn read

2ires(cid:16)2nv

dn (cid:17) =

ma
22

(8.12)

for n  4, which agrees with (7.4) because k2nv = 1, but diers from (17.1) of [6]. the
present result is the correct one since y m derived through the successive ows from d4
coincides with that obtained in [33]. in order for this to hold, it is important that 2nv
dn

obeys

2nv
dn
z

=

.

(8.13)

furthermore it is clear that the massless limit of 2nv
dn

is in agreement with the ones

obtained in [33].

8.2 spinor representation

one may notice that the dierentials 2nv

dn do not look like those obtained in [6, 34, 23].
our next task is to show that they are indeed derived from the nf = 4 sw dierentials

in spinors of so(8) and their residues transform in the spinor representation of so(2nf )
with nf  3.

first of all we note that the weights of 8s of so(8) are given by

(m1 + m2  m3  m4),
(m1  m2 + m3  m4),
(m1  m2  m3 + m4)

(8.14)

our result resolves the puzzle in section 17 of [6] why one has to replace ma by ma/2 in the nal
form of the nf = 4 curve derived from the consideration of the residues. thus it is also required to make
this replacement in (17.1) of [6], yielding the correct result as we have obtained here.

and ms

from which we see that the poles are not sent to innity. on the other hand, the residue

is evidently divergent. this gives rise to a divergent piece in the sw periods in the scaling
limit m4  . we note that this is a necessary divergence to make certain bps states
decouple. to avoid this divergent behavior, though harmless, let us alternatively take the
dierential 1

in this section, we have shown that the sw dierentials in the nf  3 theories can be
built from the vector as well as spinor representations of so(2nf ). according to section

7 they describe the same physics in the coulomb branch of n = 2 su(2) qcd with
massive quarks. the sw dierentials for nf  3 in general take the form

note here that xdx/y has double poles at innity whose existence is characteristic of
the asymptotic freedom. it is interesting that simple poles of rdnf
become congruent to the double poles at innity in the scaling limit nf  nf  1.

9 conclusions

in the framework of the f-theory compactication, we have written down the elliptic

curves for describing the n = 2 theories with ade global symmetries on a d3-brane in

the type iib 7-brane background. the sw dierentials  have then been constructed

for the fundamental and adjoint representations of the ade groups. it is shown that the

physics results are independent of the representation of . it is interesting to compare the

present result with what has been known in four-dimensional n = 2 yang-mills theory

with ade gauge symmetries. for n = 2 ade yang-mills theory the sw curves are
given by the spectral curves whose form depends explicitly on the representations r of
ade. however, the physics of the coulomb branch is equally described irrespective of r.
in [35] this is shown in terms of the universality of the special prym variety known in the

theory of spectral curves [36]. this is seen more explicitly by analyzing the picard-fuchs

equations for the sw periods [28]. therefore, the universality we found here is considered

as the global symmetry version of the universality in n = 2 yang-mills theory with local

ade gauge symmetries.

it is clear in the framework of type ii string theory that the ade global symmetries

on a d3-brane and the ade gauge symmetries of four-dimensional yang-mills theory

have the common origin in the ade singularities appearing in the degeneration of a k3
surface. in fact, if we replace the top casimir wh by wh++2h/ in (2.4)-(2.9), our ade
curves are recognized as the equations for the ade ale space bered over p1. here  is
a complex coordinate of the base p1. this reects the compactication of type ii string

theory on a k3 bered calabi-yau threefold. from this point of view, our calculation for

the fundamental of e6 in section 5.3 is indeed equivalent to that in [37] to obtain the sw

curve for the n = 2 e6 yang-mills theory from the bration of the e6 ale space. hence

our computations in section 5 can be viewed as the determination of the sw curves in the

fundamental and adjoint representations for n = 2 yang-mills theory with ade gauge

35

symmetries.

the global sections of an elliptic bration in higher representations than the adjoint
may be found by constructing the meromorphic sections. the lattice structure hidden

in our explicit computations will be related to the lattice which arises in the mordell-weil

group. it will be interesting to formulate our present results in more precise mathematical

terms in view of the relation between the mordell-weil lattice and the ade singularity

theory.

finally, it is very interesting to analyze the bps spectrum of the en theories using

our results. one application is to construct the junction lattice explicitly to describe the

bps states. this can be done at least numerically as has been performed in n = 2

su(2) theory [38, 39]. in the en theories the bps spectrum possesses the rich structure
in comparison with the dn4 theories [11]. for instance, bps states in arbitrary higher
representations of the en groups are shown to exist on the basis of (3.2). combining the

sw description properly formulated in the present paper and the junction approach will

be ecient to gain a deeper understanding of still mysterious four-dimensional n = 2

superconformal eld theories with exceptional symmetry.

at this stage one has to calculate a1, a0 which depend on the explicit form of the section.

after tedious calculations for higher rank groups, the results are expressed in terms of the

deformation parameters wqi. imposing a1 = a0 = 0 now brings about the overdetermined

system with respect to c1, c2 and c3. it is quite impressive that we can nevertheless nd

the solution so as to determine ci up to an overall normalization factor.

when we deal with the section in the adjoint representation (5.8) we need one more

step of integrating by parts. this step produces an extra contribution to the term pro-

portional to dx/y as observed in the explicit computations in the text.

appendix b

in this appendix, we present the explicit form of characteristic polynomials p rg (t) for d4,
e6, e7 and e8 from which one can read o the relation between the casimir invariants

and the deformation parameters.
