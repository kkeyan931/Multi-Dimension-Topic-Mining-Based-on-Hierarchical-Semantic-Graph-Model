abstract

linear recursion relations for the instanton corrections to the eec-
tive prepotential of n =2 supersymmetric gauge theories with an ar-
bitrary number of hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation
of an arbitrary classical gauge group are derived. the construction
proceeds from the seiberg-witten solutions and the renormalization
group type equations for the prepotential. successive iterations of
these recursion relations allow us to simply obtain instanton correc-
tions to arbitrarily high order, which we exhibit explicitly up to 6-th
order. for gauge groups su (2) and su (3), our results agree with
previous ones.

1. introduction

over the past few years there has been great progress in understanding
non-perturbative dynamics of n =2 susy gauge theories starting with the
su(2) case [1], further generalizations to other gauge groups [2] and additions
of matter hypermultiplets [3]. non-perturbative corrections in weak coupling
correspond to instanton eects [4] which were evaluated using eld theory
techniques to one instanton [4][5][6][7] and two instanton [8] orders.

some of the previous instanton calculations using the seiberg-witten
ansatz were performed by solving the picard-fuchs equations for the pe-
riod integrals corresponding to the quantum moduli parameters representing
the set of vacuum expectation values of the higgs elds [9][17][18]. other
previous calculations involved solving the period integrals directly [10], and
were found to be in agreement with the picard-fuchs and eld theory results.
in an intriguing paper [11], a recursion relation for the instanton corrections
to the eective prepotential f was found for the pure su(2) case which led
us to seek a generalization of this result for any gauge group and number of
matter hypermultiplets. in a related development, the seiberg-witten equa-
tions were viewed analogously to the whitham hierarchy equations [12] and
the wdvv equations [13]. nonlinear recursion relations for the instanton
corrections involving jacobi -functions (which themselves involve ij as in
[16]) were derived starting from the whitham hierarchy equations [14]. the
beta function of the prepotential f , rst observed in [15] and later proved
in [16], is the starting point of our discussion and provides a very direct
way at calculating instanton corrections to the prepotential f without hav-
ing to perform complicated hyperelliptic integrals and immediately obtaining
rational expressions without -functions.

the seiberg-witten solutions for classical gauge groups su(n), so(n),
and sp(n) and the renormalization group like equation for the prepotential
f , led us to the discovery of a general recursion relation expressing the
n  th order instanton correction to the prepotential f in terms of the (n 
1)th,    , 1st order instanton corrections for super yang-mills theory with
matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of classical gauge
groups g.

we start o by reviewing the seiberg-witten solution for n =2 super
yang-mills theory with hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of
any arbitrary classical gauge group. the renormalization group type equation

1

for the prepotential f is discussed next and it is shown how it can be used
to determine the instanton corrections to the prepotential to arbitrary order
in an ecient manner. recursion relations for the instanton corrections are
then derived and shown to reproduce previous results.

2. the seiberg-witten solution for arbitrary classi-

cal gauge group g

the seiberg-witten (sw) ansatz gives a prescription for determining
the prepotential of the eective action for n =2 supersymmetric yang-mills
gauge theories, as well as for determining the spectrum of bps states.

we consider, n =2 susy gauge theories with classical gauge groups
su(r + 1), so(2r + 1), sp(2r) and so(2r), of rank r and number of colours
nc = r + 1, 2r + 1, 2r, and 2r respectively. we include nf hypermulti-
plets in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, with bare masses
mj, j = 1,    , nf . we restrict to the asymptotically free theories; this limits
the hypermultiplet contents nf . (ie. nf < 2nc for su(nc)). the classical
vacuum expectation value of the gauge scalar  is parameterized by complex
moduli ak, k = 1,    , r as follows

su(r + 1)  = diag[a1,    , ar, ar+1]
so(2r + 1)  = diag[a1,    , ar, 0]

sp(2r)  = diag[a1, a1,    , ar, ar]

so(2r)  = diag[a1,    , ar]

a1 +    + ar + ar+1 = 0

ak =   0

for generic aks, the gauge symmetry is broken to u(1)r and the dynamics
is that of an abelian coulomb phase. the wilson eective lagrangian of
the quantum theory to leading order in the low momentum expansion in the
abelian coulomb phase is completely characterized by a complex analytic
prepotential f (a).

the sw ansatz for determining the full prepotential f is based on a
choice of a bration of spectral curves over the space of vacua, and of a
meromorphic 1-form d on each of these curves. the renormalized order
parameters ak of the theory, their duals ad,k, and the prepotential f are

with ak, bk a suitable set of homology cycles on the spectral curves [2].

for all n =2 supersymmetric gauge theories based on classical gauge
groups with nf hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of the
gauge group, the spectral curves and meromorphic 1-forms are

respectively. the spectral curves (4) for so(2r + 1), sp(2r) and so(2r) can
be obtained from the su(2r) spectral curve by a suitable restriction on the
classical moduli aks and masses [19].

for gauge theories with classical gauge groups and asymptotically free
coupling obeying the constraint q > 0, general arguments based on the holo-
morphicity of f , perturbative non-renormalization theorems beyond 1-loop

1for simplicity, we restrict attention here to the sp(2r) case with at least two mass-
less hypermultiplets. the cases with one or no massless hypermultiplets may be treated
accordingly [19].

ized order parameters ak and their duals ad,k in terms of the classical order
parameters ak to any order of perturbation theory in a regime where  is
small and the aks are well-separated. the calculation of ak starts o from
equations (2) and (3) producing a nal result

a very direct way of deriving the form of the instanton corrections to the
prepotential f starts o from the beta function on the right hand side of (7).

one obtains

which is a linear recursion relation for f (m)(a) in terms of the lower order
instanton corrections f (m1)(a), . . . , f (1)(a).

the intriguing part about the recursion relation (13) for f (n)(a) is that
it is linear in f (n1)(a),    , f (1)(a) and is valid for all classical gauge groups
with the number of hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation con-
strained by q > 0. previous recursion relations [11] were only valid for su(2)
with no hypermultiplets and were non-linear.

when performing explicit calculations for special cases of nc and nf , it is
useful to rewrite terms of the form (20) so that there are no aks sitting out in
front. using the denition (10) of sk(x, a) and performing contour integrals
in the complex plane by residue methods as in [10], it can be shown that

6. comparison with previous results

in order to make explicit comparisons with results in the literature, the
instanton corrections have to be rewritten in terms of symmetric polynomials
in the aks as follows.

for su(2), the existing results in the literature have the instanton ex-

pressions expressed in terms of

a1 = 2a
a2 = 2a

(22)

solving the recursion relation (13) for the pure su(2) case, the explicit
form for the n-th order instanton correction to the prepotential f was deter-
mined to be

a check of the hypermultiplet decoupling limits of the nf = 3 instanton
corrections, by letting 3m3 = 2
2 and sending m3  , reproduces the
nf = 2 results. a further decoupling of a second hypermultiplet, by letting
2m2 = 2
1 and sending mc  , reproduces the nf = 1 results. com-
parison with results in the literature [17][10][14] show an agreement to four
instantons up to a redenition of the aks as discussed in [10].

rections expressed in terms of the invariant su(3) symmetric polynomials

a check of successive hypermultiplet decoupling limits of the nf = 5 instan-
ton corrections reproduces all of the nf < 5 cases accordingly. comparison
with results in the literature [9][10][18][14] show an agreement to three in-
stantons up to a redenition of the aks as discussed in [10].

7. summary

the recursion relations discovered in this paper improve considerably the
ability to evaluate explicitly the non-perturbative instanton corrections to
n =2 super yang-mills theories. possible extensions to other problems like
the strongly coupled n =2 susy su(nc) seiberg-witten problem [20][21]
were also investigated [22].
