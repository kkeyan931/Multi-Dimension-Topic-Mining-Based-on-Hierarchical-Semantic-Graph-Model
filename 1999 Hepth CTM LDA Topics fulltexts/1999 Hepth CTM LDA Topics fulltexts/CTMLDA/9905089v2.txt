abstract

we discuss the quantum corrections to thermodynamics (and geometry)
of s(a)ds bhs using large n one-loop anomaly induced eective action for
dilaton coupled matter (scalars and spinors). it is found the temperature,
mass and entropy with account of quantum eects for multiply horizon sds
bh and sads bh what also gives the corresponding expressions for their
limits: schwarzschild and de sitter spaces.
in the last case one can talk
about quantum correction to entropy of expanding universe.

the anomaly induced action under discussion corresponds to 4d formu-
lation (s-wave approximation, 4d quantum matter is minimal one) as well
as 2d formulation (complete eective action, 2d quantum matter is dilaton
coupled one). hence, most of results are given for the same gravitational
background with interpretation as 4d quantum corrected bh or 2d quantum
corrected dilatonic bh. quantum aspects of thermodynamics of 4d t hooft
bh model are also considered.

1 introduction

the famous bekenstein-hawking entropy of black hole [2] is known to be
proportional to the surface area of its event horizon.
it gives the bright
manifestation of analogy between thermodynamics and bhs [1]. however,
despite numerous attempts varying from strings [3], three dimensional gravity
[4, 5], induced gravity [6], etc., the derivation of bh entropy from statistical
mechanics is not yet completely clear.

among other (thermodynamic) quantities used to describe bhs one can
mention not only entropy but also temperature, horizon radius, mass, energy,
charges,etc. in order to understand better the thermodynamic properties of
bhs it is extremely important to nd the unied way to evaluate the quantum
corrections to all above characteristics of bh. in its own turn, such study is
expected to give the insights to the better formulations of quantum gravity.
unfortunately, the calculation of quantum corrections to thermodynamics
of dierent bhs is not easy task. usual approach is to consider (simple)
quantum matter on some bh background (as a rule rindler space) where
spectrum of the corresponding operator is known. then, in frames of some
regularization one can nd the eective action (or stress energy tensor) what
may be used as quantum correction to classical action. this very tedious
procedure should be repeated again for each specic geometry (when it is
possible). the complete eective action (ea) on an arbitrary gravitational
background is not yet known (see ,for a review [11]).
it would be really
interesting to present more universal approach, at least in the situations
when ea is known for some classes of backgrounds.

in the present paper we suggest such universal prescription to the calcu-
lation of quantum corrections to bhs. it is based on anomaly induced ea
for 2d dilaton coupled matter (scalars and spinors). such ea is found on an
arbitrary dilaton-gravitational background. from 4d point of view it gives
so-called s-wave approximation ea and from 2d point of view it gives total
one-loop ea for dilaton coupled matter which is typical in 2d brans-dicke-
matter theory (in einstein frame). as dilaton and metric dependence of this
ea is known it may be easily added to classical action. after that one is left
with modied but still classical gravity where calculation of thermody-
namics of bhs is now routine work. moreover, the results obtained in such
way have 4d interpretation as well as 2d (4d bh may be easily interpreted
as 2d dilatonic bh).

2

we mainly discuss multiply horizon schwarzschild-(anti-)de sitter
(s(a)ds) bhs which typically may occur in the early universe as primor-
dial ones.
in addition, as limiting backgrounds they have de sitter and
schwarzschild spaces. note that s(a)ds bhs do not normally appear at
the nal stage of star collapse. nevertheless, still there maybe mechanisms
to produce them: via bhs creation at the early universe [23] or via direct
inducing of such primordial objects due to quantum eects [24].

they also may demonstrate the realization of beautiful bhs anti-
evaporation process [13, 25] which may become the basis for creation of
muliply inationary universes [13, 24]. it is important that anti-evaporation
of bhs may put cosmological limits to the content of guts[25].

the paper is organised as follows. the review of anomaly induced ea
evaluation and construction of eective equations of motion is presented in
the next section.
in section three, using such ea we nd quantum cor-
rections to bh entropy, mass, horizon radius and temperature for 4d and
2d schwarzschild bhs. in section 4 the same problem is solved for sds (or
sads) bhs. the results of previous section may be reproduced from such cal-
culation by taking the correspondent limit. quantum properties of another
limit (de sitter space) are also discussed. in this case we get the quantum
correction to the entropy of expanding universe. in the last section we dis-
cuss quantum corrections to thermodynamics of t hooft bh model, working
in the same fashion. some outlook related with quite general character of
our approach as well as the possibility of other applications is given in nal
section.

2 the eective action and equations of mo-

tion

we will start from the action of einstein gravity with n minimal real scalars
and m majorana fermions

where i and i are real scalars and majorana spinors, respectively. in order
to apply large n approach, n and m are considered to be large, n, m  1,
g and  are gravitational and cosmological constants, respectively.
the convenient choice for the spherically symmetric spacetime is the fol-

lowing one

ds2 = g dxdx + e2d,

(2)

where ,  = 0, 1, g and  depend only on x0, x1 and d corresponds to
the two-dimensional sphere.

the action (1), reduced according to (2) takes the form

note that the fermion degrees of freedom after reduction are twice of original
ones.

working in large n and s-wave approximation, one can calculate the
quantum correction to sred (eective action). using 2d conformal anomaly
for dilaton coupled scalar, calculated in [7] (see also [8, 9, 10]) one can nd
the anomaly induced eective action [8, 9] (with accuracy up to conformally
invariant functional for the total eective action, see [11] for a review). there
is no consistent approach to calculate this conformally invariant functional
in closed form. however, one can nd this functional as some expansion
of schwingerdewitt type [12] keeping only the leading term. then, the
eective action may be written in the following form [9, 12] (these works
were related with only scalars)

the rst term represents the polyakov anomaly induced action, the second
and third terms give the dilaton dependent corrections to the anomaly in-
duced action the last term (conformally invariant functional) is found in

ref.[12]. note that ea for dilaton coupled spinor has been found in ref.[17]
where it was shown that unlike to scalar case there is no ambiguety in ea
related with conformally invariant functional. spinor ea is known exactly
in both cases: minimal or dilaton coupled spinor.

this last equation is necessary to delete the constant t0 (which is dened

in the next sections we
use above equations of motion in order to nd quantum corrections to
dierent bh congurations. note also that there were also attempts in
refs.[13, 9, 12, 14] to apply such ea (usually without logarithmic term and

only for scalars) for quantum considerations around bhs (for semiclassical
stress tensor with dilaton,see ref.[16]). notice also that some terms of above
ea have similarities with counterterms added by hands to cghs dilatonic
gravity model [18], forming its extension as rst model [19]. for a very in-
complete list of references on the study of 2d dilatonic bhs in these models,
see refs.[20].

3 quantum corrections to 2d and 4d schwarzschild

black hole

first we consider the case  = 0. in the classical limit (n  0), we obtain,
of course, the schwarzschild black hole as solution of equations of motion:

e2 = e20 ,

e2 = e20 ,
e20 = e20 = 1

here  = 2gmbh and mbh is the black hole mass. we now consider the
quantum corrections by regarding gn is small and assuming

 = 0 + gn ,

 = 0 + gn (0 = 0) .

(39)

here we used (30), (35) and (37). we also put k = 1. the rst term expresses
the usual classical mass mbh since  = 2gmbh and the second term is due
to the quantum eects. notice the regularization scheme dependence vie the
presence of parameter a in above expressions. it maybe xed by the choice
of physical regularization.

11

the qualitative structures of the entropy (35), the temperature (37) and
the energy (mass) (39) are similar to the corresponding quantities found in
[14]. note however that our result incorporates the quantum eects of not
only scalars but also of spinors to bh conguration under consideration.

let us turn now to 2d formulation of above results. the classical black
hole solution (16) can be regarded as a purely two dimensional object if we
start with the reduced action (3). the thermodynamical quantities as the
energy and entropy for the two dimensional charged black hole with dilaton
are evaluated on the classical and one-loop levels in [12, 15].
in [15], the
boundary of the universe is introduced at the radius r = l as in (29). if
there is a boundary, we need to add the boundary terms to the action in
order that the variation with respect to the metric should be well-dened.
by including the boundary term, the formula for the energy (mass) of the
black hole with one-loop quantum correction was derived in [15] as follows,

e(, l) =

e(x) , d((x)) =

.

(41)

since only the quantum correction from the one scalar eld was evaluated in
[15], we need to do the following replacement

h  n a , c 

12b
a

.

(42)

we should note that we usually choose h = 1 in this paper. in the expression
(40), the quantities with suces cl correspond to the classical ones. if we
choose the boundary condition as in (29), we nd

g(l) = gcl(l) = 1 


l

, (l) = cl(l) = 0 .

(43)

therefore

since the energy (44) diverges in the limit of l  +, we need to subtract

(45)

which is nothing but the classical black hole mass. this tells that there is
no the quantum correction for the mass or the boundary condition in (29)
corresponds to the renormalization condition that the mass does not suer
the quantum correction. even if the black hole is purely two dimensional
one (but with dilaton), the denition of the temperature is not changed
and one gets (37). then using the energy (45), the temperature (37) and
the denition of the entropy (38), we obtain the following expression of the
entropy

here c is the constant of the integration. the classical part coincides with
the usual bekenstein-hawking entropy when we regard the black hole as the
four dimensional object.

hence we calculated quantum corrections to simplest black hole thermo-
dynamical quantities. the result is actually obtained for two objects: 4d bh
and the same object described as 2d dilatonic bh. that shows remarkable
property of s-wave ea that it could be applied to 4d as well as to 2d ge-
ometry (where it looks already as complete ea). it is straitforward now to
extend the discussion for other types of bhs.

4 quantum corrections to sds and sads

black holes

we now consider more general schwarzschild-(anti-)de sitter black holes. in
the classical limit (n  0) in (12)  (15) with non-vanishing cosmological

constant , we obtain the usual schwarzschild-(anti)de sitter as solution of
equations of motion

here  is a constant of the integration corresponding to the black hole mass
( = 2gmbh). the parameters xi (i = 1, 2, 3) are solutions of the equation
e20 = 0. among xis, two are real and positive if  > 0 and 2 < 4
9 and they
correspond to black hole and cosmological horizons in the schwarzschild-de
sitter black hole. on the other hand, only one is real if  < 0. the explicit

if we start from the reduced action (3), the classical solution (47) can be
regarded to express the purely two dimensional schwarzschild-(anti) de sitter
black holes with dilaton. hence, we again obtain 2d or 4d formulation for
such object. note that reduction of sads bh maybe understood as 2d
dilatonic ads bh where quantum eects of dilaton were recently discussed
in ref.[27].

as in (17), we consider the quantum corrections regarding gn as small.

eq.(56) tells that the scalar curvature in (33) is regular when x  xi . the

(58)

the second term in (58) corresponds to the quantum correction. when we
regard the black holes as purely two dimensional ones starting from (3), it
is rather dicult to dene the entropy since horizon is a point and does

17

not have an area. in case of schwarzschild de sitter black holes, it is also
dicult to dene the entropy in the same way as in schwarzschild case in
(46). the diculty comes since we cannot dene the black hole mass as
in (45), where we need to choose the radius l of the universe large, which
non-trivial cosmological horizon prevents.

the equation (57) tells that the behavior of the metric near the horizon

x = xi  2gn ci is given by

the second and third terms correspond to the quantum correction. the
denition of the temperature is the same if we regard the black holes as
purely two dimensional ones. we should note that there are two dierent
temperatures corresponding to the black hole and the cosmological horizons,
respectively, for schwarzschild de sitter black holes.

the schwarzschild black hole in the previous section can be obtained as
a limit of   +0 in schwarzschild-de sitter black hole. in the limit, xis in
(47) behave as

xi  ,s 3

(61)

here the constant of the integration l is related with 0 by 0 = 1
122 ln l
and s is given by s = 1 + const. the additional constant diverges in
the limiting procedure   +0 but the divergence can be absorbed into the
redenition of s.

18

we now consider de sitter space as a limit of   0. if we choose xi as

a cosmological horizon

xi = h  s 3

we should also note that there appears a singularity at the origin x = 0,
which might be a sign that the s-wave approximation is not valid there since
the origin is always a singularity of s-wave. the s-wave approximation,
however, should be valid near the cosmological horizon.

it is interesting to note that last expression describes quantum corrections
to the entropy of expanding inationary universe (as de sitter space may be
considered as such inationary universe). that gives new terms proportional
to particles number as compare with classical entropy of expanding universe
discussed extensively in refs.[21].

taking yi = 2h and bi = b in (60), the temperature is expressed as

hence we found quantum corrections to the temperature and the entropy for
4d de sitter space (as the limit of sds bh) as well as for sds bh and sads
bh. in the last case of sds or sads bhs we also dened the quantum correc-
tion to the temperature of corresponding 2d object (i.e. corresponding bh
with dilaton). the calculation of 2d quantum entropy is more dicult and
cannot be done by using only 4d point of view unlike the case of schwarzschild
bh.

5 quantum corrections to t hooft bh model

we now consider t hoofts bh model [22].
in the model, the hawking
massless particles emitted from a black hole are treated as an envelope of
matter which obeys the classical equation of state, and acts as a source of
the gravity. then, the horizon vanishes and the black hole entropy can be
calculated as that of the particles by using the hartree-fock approximation.
in this model bh entropy calculated with such recipe does not give the
standard 1/4 coecient in area law. below we only consider scalars for
simplicity, then one can put a = b = 1 in formulas of previous section.

in the rindler space limit, where the black hole mass mbh = 

2g is large,

the metric has the following form[22]

e20 =

6

2

p (cid:18)2mbh
x (cid:19)

in the following, we put g = 1 when there is no any confusion. following
[22], a new coordinate y is introduced by

5

y  (cid:18)2mbh
x (cid:19)

.

(75)

we suppose that matter quantum eects are described by the same ef-
fective action as in section 2 (without spinors). then one can use the same
eective action as quantum correction to t hooft equations of motion. that,
of course, adds new terms to these equations.

subtracting the contribution from the classical matter, we obtain

in [22], the entropy comes from the massless scalar elds in the background
including the backreaction by hawking radiation. the obtained entropy is
dierent from the bekenstein-hawking entropy by a factor 8
5 at the classi-
cal level. note that there are another examples of bhs (like kerr-bolt-ads)
where there are deviations from bekenstein-hawking law. in (91), the cor-
rection to the entropy is estimated. however, as quantum corrections are
assumed to be small perturbation it was hard from the very beginning to
expect that they may change the qualitative structure of the model. in par-
ticular, bh entropy does not reproduce the bekenstein-hawking law.

the mass mbh is originally the mass of the black hole measured in the
asymptotically at region, i.e., outside of the black hole. in this section, we
can regard mbh is dened by the temperature.

hence, new methods (not semiclassical ones) are necessary in strong quan-
tum gravity regime in order to solve the problems related with t hooft bh
model. it could be that bh-thermodynamical laws in such regime should be
completely revised.

6 discussion

we studied quantum properties of s(a)ds bhs using anomaly induced ea for
dilaton coupled matter. the explicit evaluation of thermodynamic quantities
(temperature, mass, entropy) with account of quantum eects is done for

25

s(a)ds bhs as well as for their limiting cases: schwarzschild and de sitter
spaces. the case of t hooft bh model is also considered.

the anomaly induced ea under discussion gives the possibility for 4d
formulation (s-wave approximation) and for 2d formulation. hence, the cor-
responding results (with small modications) are valid for the same back-
ground being quantum corrected 4d bh or quantum corrected 2d dilatonic
bh. the formulation is general enough. there is no problem to apply the
same technique for the calculation of quantum corrections to any other grav-
itational background. using of other versions of ea (say, the one induced by
4d anomaly) does not make big qualitative dierence.

note, however, that we considered quantum ea as small perturbation to
classical one. in this way, we estimated quantum corrections to the entropy of
de sitter (inationary) universe. clearly, such investigation should be more
important when quantum eects play the dominant role (say, gravitational
background is induced by quantum eects). as an example, let us consider
n = 4 su(n) super ym theory.
in this case, starting with zero cosmo-
logical constant we get the eective cosmological constant [26]: h 2 =  1
b ,
b =  (n 21)
(8)2 and  is gravitational constant. hence, classical entropy of de
sitter universe is quantum entropy on the same time and it is given by the
standard expression with the change of cosmological constant by the eective
cosmological constant h 2. it would be really interesting to investigate the
questions related with the quantum entropy of bhs and expanding universe
(when there is cosmological horizon [21]) in such strong quantum regime.
